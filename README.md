# The Mahabharata (Online)

The English translation of the Mahabharata by K.M. Ganguly hosted by AASI, originally digitized by Gutenberg and Sacred Texts.

## Description

This project has two components:

1. The first is the static HTML page generated by `mbh2html.py` reading the original digitized plaintext version in the `txt/` directory. The resulting HTMLs are in `build/`.
  - The `build` directory structure contains the following files and folders
    - `{N}/` where N is between 1 to 18: Each of these is a parva in the Mahabharata, and contains files named as `1.html`, `2.html`, ..., denoting a specific section.
    - `resources/`, contains JS, CSS, Images, and Fonts for the website.
    - `index.html`, landing page.
    - `search.html`, the search page.
2. The second is the search index, which is a Flask application that must be hosted someplace else, and configured in the `build/config.json`.

## Hosting

1. Clone the repo,
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aasi-archive/mbh
```
2. Build the static website
```bash
python ./mbh2html.py
```
3. Build the search index (this will take a while)
```bash
cd search
python mbhindexer.py 
```
4. Launch the search index (Flask starts on localhost:5000)
```bash
python mbhsearch.py
```
5. Launch the static website
```bash
cd ../build
python -m http.server 8000
```
