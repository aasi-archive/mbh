                            "Dhritarashtra said, Thou shouldst always ascertain the Mandalas that<br>belong to thee, to thy foes, to neutrals, and to those that are disposed<br>equally towards thee and thy foes, O Bharata.[12] The Mandalas also of<br>the four kinds of foes, of these called Atatayins, and of allies, and the<br>allies of foes, should be distinguished by thee, O crusher of foes.[13]<br>The ministers of state, the people of the provinces, the garrisons of<br>forts, and the forces, O foremost one of Kuru's race, may or may not be<br>tampered with. (Thou shouldst, therefore, behave in such a manner that<br>these may not be tampered with by thy foes). The twelve (enumerated<br>above), O son of Kunti, constitute the principal concerns of kings. These<br>twelve, as also sixty, having Ministers for their foremost, should be<br>looked after by the king.[14] Professors conversant with the science of<br>politics call these by the name of Mandala. Understand, O Yudhishthira,<br>that the six incidents (of peace, war, march, halt, sowing dissensions,<br>and conciliation) depend upon these. Growth and diminution should also be<br>understood, as also the condition of being stationary. The attributes of<br>the sixfold incidents, O thou of mighty arms, as resting on the two and<br>seventy (already enumerated), should also be carefully understood. When<br>one's own side has become strong and the side of the foe his become weak,<br>it is then, O son of Kunti, that the king should war against the foe and<br>strive to will victory. When the enemy is strong and one's own side is<br>weak, then the weak king, if possessed of intelligence, should seek to<br>make peace with the enemy. The king should collect a large store of<br>articles (for his commissariat). When able to march out, he should on no<br>account make a delay, O Bharata. Besides, he should on that occasion set<br>his men to offices for which they are fit, without being moved by any<br>other consideration. (When obliged to yield a portion of his territories)<br>he should give his foe only such land as does not produce crops in<br>abundance. (When obliged to give wealth), he should give gold containing<br>much base metal. (When obliged to give a portion of his forces), he<br>should give such men as are not noted for strength. One that is skilled<br>in treaties should, when taking land or gold or men from the foe, take<br>what is possessed of attributes the reverse of this.[15] In making<br>treaties of peace, the son of the (defeated) king, should be demanded as<br>a hostage, O chief of the Bharatas. A contrary course of conduct would<br>not be beneficial, O son. If a calamity comes over the king, he should,<br>with knowledge of means-and counsels, strive to emancipate himself from<br>it.[16] The king, O foremost of monarchs, should maintain the cheerless<br>and the destitute (such as the blind, the deaf and dumb, and the<br>diseased) among his people. Himself protecting his own kingdom, the king,<br>possessed of great might, should direct all his efforts, either one after<br>another or simultaneously, against his foes. He should afflict and<br>obstruct them and seek to drain their treasury. The king that desires his<br>own growth should never injure the subordinate chieftains that are under<br>his sway. O son of Kunti, thou shouldst never seek to war with that king<br>who desires to conquer the whole Earth. Thou shouldst seek to gain<br>advantages by producing, with the aid of thy ministers, dissensions among<br>his aristocracy and subordinate chieftains. A powerful king should never<br>seek to exterminate weak kings, for these do good to the world by<br>cherishing the good and punishing the wicked. O foremost of kings, thou<br>shouldst live, adopting the behaviour of the cane.[17] If a strong king<br>advances against a weak one, the latter should make him desist, by<br>adopting conciliation and other modes. If unable to stop the invader in<br>this way, then he, as also those that are disposed to do him good, should<br>fall upon the foe for battling with him. Indeed, with his ministers and<br>treasury and citizens, he should thus adopt force against the invader. If<br>battling with the foe becomes hopeless, then he should fall, sacrificing<br>his resources one after another. Casting off his life in this way, he<br>will attain to liberation from all sorrow.'"
