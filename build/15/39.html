                            "Narada said, 'The king has not been burnt to death by an unsanctified<br>fire. I have heard this there. I tell thee, O Bharata, such has not been<br>the fate of Vichitraviryya. It has been heard by us that when the old<br>king endued with great intelligence and subsisting on air alone entered<br>the woods (after his return from Gangadwara), he caused his sacrificial<br>fires to be duly ignited. Having performed his sacred rites therewith, he<br>abandoned them all. Then the Yajaka Brahmanas he had with him cast off<br>those fires in a solitary part of the woods and went away as they liked<br>on other errands, O foremost one of Bharata's race. The fire thus cast<br>off grew in the woods. It then produced a general conflagration in the<br>forest. Even this is what I have heard from the ascetics dwelling on the<br>banks of Ganga. United with that (sacred) fire of his own, O chief of the<br>Bharatas, the king, as I have already said unto thee, met with death on<br>the banks of Ganga. O sinless one, this is what the ascetics have told<br>me,&#8212;those, viz., whom I saw on the banks of the sacred Bhagirathi, O<br>Yudhishthira. Thus O lord of Earth, king Dhritarashtra, coming into<br>contact with his own sacred fire, departed from this world and attained<br>to that high goal that has been his. Through service rendered by her to<br>her seniors, thy mother, O lord of men, has attained to very great<br>success. There is not the slightest doubt of this. It behoveth thee, O<br>king of kings, to now discharge the rites of water to their honour, with<br>all thy brothers. Let, therefore, the necessary steps be taken towards<br>that end.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;'Then that lord of Earth, that foremost of men,<br>that upholder of the burthens of the Pandavas, went out, accompanied by<br>all his brothers as well as the ladies of his household. The inhabitants<br>of the city as also those of the provinces, impelled by their loyalty,<br>also went out. They all proceeded towards the banks of Ganga, every one<br>clad in only single peace of raiment. Then all those foremost of men,<br>having plunged into the stream, placed Yuyutsu at their head, and began<br>to offer oblations of water unto the high-souled king. And they also gave<br>similar oblations unto Gandhari and Pritha, naming each separately and<br>mentioning their families. Having finished those rites that cleanse the<br>living, they came back but without entering their capital took up their<br>residence outside of it. They also despatched a number of trusted people<br>well conversant with the ordinances relating to the cremation of the<br>dead, to Gangadwara where the old king had been burnt to death. The king,<br>having rewarded those men beforehand, commanded them to accomplish those<br>rites of cremation which the bodies of Dhritarashtra and Gandhari and<br>Kunti still awaited.[62] On twelfth day, the king, properly purified,<br>duly performed the Sraddhas of his deceased relations, which were<br>characterised by gifts in abundance. Referring to Dhritarashtra,<br>Yudhishthira made many gifts of gold and silver, of kine and costly beds.<br>Uttering the names of Gandhari and Pritha, the king, endued with great<br>energy, made many excellent gifts. Every man received what thing he<br>wished and as much of it as he wished. Beds and food, and cars and<br>conveyances, and jewels and gems, and other wealth were given away in<br>profusion. Indeed, the king referring to his two mothers, gave away cars<br>and conveyances, robes and coverlets, various kinds of food, and female<br>slaves adorned with diverse ornaments. Having thus made many kinds of<br>gifts in profusion, that lord of Earth then entered his capital called<br>after the elephant. Those men who had gone to the banks of Ganga at the<br>command of the king, having disposed of (by cremation) the remains of the<br>king and two queens, returned to the city. Having duly honoured those<br>remains with garlands and scents of diverse kinds and disposed of them,<br>they informed Yudhishthira of the accomplishment of their task. The great<br>Rishi Narada, having comforted king Yudhishthira of righteous soul, went<br>away to where he liked. Even thus did king Dhritarashtra make his exit<br>from this world after having passed three years in the forest and ten and<br>five years in the city. Having lost all his children in battle, he had<br>many gifts in honour of his kinsmen, relatives, and friends, his brethren<br>and own people. King Yudhishthira after the death of his uncle, became<br>very cheerless. Deprived of his kinsmen and relatives, he somehow bore<br>the burthen of sovereignty.<br><br>One should listen with rapt attention to this Asramavasika Parvan, and<br>having heard it recited, one should feed Brahmanas with Habishya,<br>honouring them with scents and garlands."'<br><br>The end of Asramavasika Parvan.
