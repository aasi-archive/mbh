                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Those foremost of ascetics, viz. Narada and Parvata<br>and Devala of austere penances, came there to see king Dhritarashtra. The<br>Island-born Vyasa with all his disciples, and other persons endued with<br>great wisdom and crowned with ascetic success, and the royal sage<br>Satayupa of advanced years and possessed of great merit, also came. Kunti<br>worshipped them with due rites, O king. All those ascetics were highly<br>gratified with the worship offered to them. Those great Rishis gladdened<br>the high-souled king Dhritarashtra with discourses on religion and<br>righteousness. At the conclusion of their converse, the celestial Rishi<br>Narada, beholding all things as objects of direct perceptions, said the<br>following words.'<br><br>"Narada said, 'There was a ruler of the Kekayas, possessed of great<br>prosperity and perfectly fearless. His name was Sahasrachitya and he was<br>the grandfather of this Satayupa. Resigning his kingdom to his eldest son<br>endued with a large measure of righteousness, the virtuous king<br>Sahasrachitya retired into the woods. Reaching the other end of blazing<br>penances, that lord of Earth. endued with great splendour, attained to<br>the region of Purandara where he continued to live in his company. On<br>many occasions, while visiting the region of Indra, O king, I saw the<br>monarch, whose sins had all been burnt off by penances, residing in<br>Indra's abode. After the same manner, king Sailalaya, the grandfather of<br>Bhagadatta, attained to the region of Indra by the power alone of his<br>penances. There was another king, O monarch, of the name of Prishadhra<br>who resembled the wielder of the thunder-bolt himself. That king also, by<br>his penances proceeded from the Earth to Heaven. In this very forest, O<br>king, that lord of Earth, Purukutsa, the soil of Mandhatri, attained to<br>high success. That foremost of rivers, viz., Narmada, became the consort<br>of that king. Having undergone penances in this very forest, that ruler<br>of Earth proceeded to Heaven. There was another king, highly righteous,<br>of the name of Sasaloman. He too underwent severe austerities in this<br>forest and then ascended to Heaven. Thou also, O monarch, having arrived<br>at this forest, shalt, through the grace of the Island-born, attain to a<br>goal that is very high and that is difficult of attainment. Thou also, O<br>foremost of kings, at the end of thy penances, become endued with great<br>prosperity and, accompanied by Gandhari, attain to the goal reached by<br>those high-souled ones. Dwelling in the presence of the slayer of Vala,<br>Pandu thinks of thee always. He will, O monarch, certainly assist thee in<br>the attainment of prosperity. Through serving thee and Gandhari, this<br>daughter-in-law of thine, possessed of great fame, will attain to<br>residence with her husband in the other world. She is the mother of<br>Yudhishthira who is the eternal Dharma. We behold all this, O king, with<br>our spiritual vision. Vidura will enter into the high-souled<br>Yudhishthira. Sanjaya also, through meditation, will ascend from this<br>world into Heaven.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'That high-souled chief of Kuru's race,<br>possessed of learning, having, with his wife, heard these words of<br>Narada, praised them and worshipped Narada with unprecedented honours.<br>The conclave of Brahmanas there present became filled with great joy, and<br>desirous of gladdening king Dhritarashtra, O monarch, themselves<br>worshipped Narada with profound regards. Those foremost of regenerate<br>persons also praised the words of Narada. Then the royal sage Satayupa,<br>addressing Narada, said, 'Thy holy self hath enhanced the devotion of the<br>Kuru king, of all those people here, and of myself also, O thou of great<br>splendour. I have, however, the wish to ask thee something. Listen to me<br>as I say it. It has reference to the king Dhritarashtra, O celestial<br>Rishi, that art worshipped by all the worlds. Thou art acquainted with<br>the truth of every affair. Endued with celestial sight, thou beholdest, O<br>regenerate Rishi, what the diverse goals are of human beings. Thou hast<br>said what the goal has been of the kings mentioned by thee, viz.,<br>association with the chief of celestials. Thou hast not, however, O great<br>Rishi, declared what those regions are that will be acquired by this<br>king. O puissant one, I wish to hear from thee what region will be<br>acquired by the royal Dhritarashtra. It behoveth thee to tell me truly<br>the kind of region that will be his and the time when he will attain to<br>it.' Thus addressed by him, Narada of celestial sight and endued with<br>austere penances, said in the midst of the assembly these words highly<br>agreeable to the minds of all.'<br><br>"Narada said, 'Repairing at my will to the mansion of Sakra, I have seen<br>Sakra the lord or Sachi; and there, O royal sage. I have beheld king<br>Pandu. There a talk arose, O monarch, regarding this Dhritarashtra and<br>those highly austere penances which he is performing. There I heard from<br>the lips of Sakra himself that there are three years yet of the period of<br>life allotted to this king. After that, king Dhritarashtra, accompanied<br>by his wife Gandhari, will go to the regions of Kuvera and be highly<br>honoured by that king of kings. He will go there on a car moving at his<br>will, his person adorned with celestial ornaments. He is the son of a<br>Rishi; he is highly blessed; he has burnt all his sins by his penances.<br>Endued with a righteous soul, lie will rove at will through the regions<br>of the deities, the Gandharvas, and the Rakshasas. That about which thou<br>hast enquired is a mystery of the gods. Through my affection for you, I<br>have declared this high truth. Ye all are possessed of the wealth of<br>Srutis and have consumed all your sins by your penances.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued.. "Hearing these sweet words of the celestial<br>Rishi, all the persons there assembled, as also king Dhritarashtra,<br>became greatly cheered and highly pleased. Having cheered Dhritarashtra<br>of great wisdom with such talk, they left the spot, wending away by the<br>path that belongs to those who are crowned with success."'
