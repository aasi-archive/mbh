                            (Asramavasa Parva)<br><br>OM! AFTER HAVING bowed down to Narayana, and Nara, the foremost of men,<br>and unto the goddess Saraswati also, must the word Jaya be uttered.<br><br>"Janamejaya said 'After having acquired their kingdom, how did my<br>grandsires, the high-souled Pandavas, conduct themselves towards the<br>high-souled king Dhritarashtra? How, indeed, did that king who had all<br>his counsellors and sons slain, who was without a refuge, and whose<br>affluence had disappeared, behave? How also did Gandhari of great fame<br>conduct herself? For how many years did my high-souled grandsires rule<br>the kingdom? It behoveth thee to tell me all this.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Having got back their kingdom, the high-souled<br>Pandavas, their foes all slain, ruled the Earth, placing Dhritarashtra at<br>their head. Vidura, and Sanjaya and Yuyutsu of great intelligence, who<br>was Dhritarashtra's son by his Vaisya wife, used to wait upon<br>Dhritarashtra. The Pandavas used to take the opinion of that king in all<br>matters. Indeed, for ten and five years, they did all things under the<br>advice of the old king. Those heroes used very often to go to that<br>monarch and sit beside him, after having worshipped his feet, agreeably<br>to the wishes of king Yudhishthira the just. They did all things under<br>the command of Dhritarashtra who smelt their heads in affection. The<br>daughter of king Kuntibhoja also obeyed Gandhari in everything. Draupadi<br>and Subhadra and the other ladies of the Pandavas behaved towards the old<br>king and the queen as if they were their own father-in-law and<br>mother-in-law. Costly beds and robes and ornaments, and food and drink<br>and other enjoyable articles, in profusion and of such superior kinds as<br>were worthy of royal use, were presented by king Yudhishthira unto<br>Dhritarashtra. Similarly Kunti behaved towards Gandhari as towards a<br>senior. Vidura, and Sanjaya, and Yuyutsu, O thou of Karu's race, used to<br>always wait upon the old king whose sons had all been slain. The dear<br>brother-in-law of Drona, viz., the very Superior Brahmana, Kripa, that<br>mighty bowman, also attended upon the king. The holy Vyasa also used to<br>often meet with the old monarch and recite to him the histories of old<br>Rishis and celestial ascetics and Pitris and Rakshasas. Vidura, under the<br>orders of Dhritarashtra, superintended the discharge of all acts of<br>religious merit and all that related to the administration of the law.<br>Through the excellent policy of Vidura, by the expenditure of even a<br>small wealth, the Pandavas obtained numerous agreeable services from<br>their feudatories and followers. King Dhritarashtra liberated prisoners<br>and pardoned those that were condemned to death. King Yudhishthira the<br>just never said anything to this. On those occasions when the son of<br>Amvika went on pleasure excursions, the Kuru king Yudhishthira of great<br>energy used to give him every article of enjoyment. Aralikas, and<br>juice-makers, and makers of Ragakhandavas waited on king Dhritarashtra as<br>before.[1] Pandu's son, collected costly robes and garlands of diverse<br>kinds and duly offered them to Dhritarashtra. Maireya wines, fish of<br>various kinds, and sherbets and honey, and many delightful kinds of food<br>prepared by modifications (of diverse articles), were caused to be made<br>for the old king as in his days of prosperity. Those kings of Earth who<br>came there one after another, all used to wait upon the old Kuru monarch<br>as before. Kunti, and Draupadi, and she of the Sattwata race, possessed<br>of great fame, and Ulupi, the daughter of the snake chief, and queen<br>Chitrangada, and the sister of Dhrishtaketu, and the daughter of<br>Jarasandha,&#8212;these and many other ladies, O chief of men, used to wait<br>upon the daughter of Suvala like maids of all work. That Dhritarashtra,<br>who was deprived of all his children, might not feel unhappy in any<br>matter, was what Yudhishthira often said unto his brothers to see. They<br>also, on their part, listening to these commands of grave import from<br>king Yudhishthira, showed particular obedience to the old king. There was<br>one exception, however. It embraced Bhimasena. All that had followed from<br>that match at dice which had been brought about by the wicked<br>understanding of Dhritarashtra, did not disappear from the heart of that<br>hero. (He remembered those incidents still)."'
