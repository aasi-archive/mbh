                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Those foremost of men, the heroic Pandavas,&#8212;those<br>delighters of their mother&#8212;became exceedingly afflicted with grief. They<br>who had formerly been always engaged in kingly offices, did not at that<br>time attend to those acts at all in their capital. Afflicted with deep<br>grief, they failed to derive pleasure from anything. If any body accosted<br>them, they never honoured him with an answer. Although those irresistible<br>heroes were in gravity like the ocean, yet they were now deprived of<br>their knowledge and their very senses by the grief they felt. Thinking of<br>their mother, the sons of Pandu were filled with anxiety as to how their<br>emaciated mother was serving the old couple. 'How, indeed, is that king,<br>whose sons have all been slain and who is without refuge, living alone,<br>with only his wife, in the woods that are the haunt of beasts of prey?<br>Alas, how does that highly blessed queen, Gandhari, whose dear ones have<br>all been slain, follow her blind lord in the solitary woods?'&#8212;Even such<br>was the anxiety manifested by the Pandavas when they talked with one<br>another. They then set their hearts upon seeing the king in his forest<br>retreat. Then Sahadeva, bowing down to the king, said, 'I see thy heart<br>to be set upon seeing our sire. From my respect for thee, however, I<br>could not speedily open my mouth on the subject of our journey to the<br>woods. The time for that sojourn is now come. By good luck I shall see<br>Kunti living in the observance of penances, with matted locks on her<br>head, practising severe austerities, and emaciated with sleeping on<br>blades of Kusa and Kasa. She was brought up in palaces and mansions, and<br>nursed in every comfort and luxury. Alas, when shall I see my mother who<br>is now toil-worn and plunged into exceeding misery? Without doubt, O<br>chief of Bharata's race, the ends of mortals are exceedingly uncertain,<br>since Kunti, who is a princess by birth, is now living in misery in the<br>woods.' Hearing these words of Sahadeva, queen Draupadi, that foremost of<br>all women duly honouring the king said, with proper salutations,&#8212;Alas,<br>when shall I see queen Pritha, if, indeed, she be yet alive. I shall<br>consider my life as not passed in vain if I succeed in beholding her once<br>more, O king. Let this sort of understanding be ever stable in thee. Let<br>thy mind always take a pleasure in such righteousness as is involved, O<br>king of kings, in thy desire of bestowing such a high boon on us. Know, O<br>king, that all these ladies of thy house are staying with their feet<br>raised for the journey, from desire of beholding Kunti, and Gandhari, and<br>my father-in-law. Thus addressed by queen Draupadi, the king, O chief of<br>Bharata's race, summoned all the leaders of his forces to his presence<br>and told them,&#8212;'Cause my army, teeming with cars and elephants, to march<br>out. I shall behold king Dhritarashtra who is now living in the woods.'<br>Unto those that supervised the concerns of the ladies, the king gave the<br>order, 'Let diverse kinds of conveyances be properly equipt, and all my<br>closed litters that count by thousands. Let carriages and granaries, and<br>wardrobes, and treasuries, be equipt and ordered out, and let mechanics<br>have the command to march out. Let men in charge of treasuries go out on<br>the way leading to the ascetic retreats on Kurukshetra. Whoever amongst<br>the citizens wishes to see the king is allowed to do so without any<br>restriction. Let him proceed, properly protected. Let cooks and<br>superintendents of kitchens, and the whole culinary establishment, and<br>diverse kinds of edibles and viands, be ordered to be borne out on carts<br>and conveyances. Let it be proclaimed that we march out tomorrow. Indeed,<br>let no delay occur (in carrying out the arrangements). Let pavilions and<br>resting houses of diverse kinds be erected on the way.' Even these were<br>the commands which the eldest son of Pandu gave, with his brothers. When<br>morning came, O monarch, the king set out, with a large train of women<br>and old men. Going out of his city, king Yudhishthira waited five days<br>for such citizens as might accompany him, and then proceeded towards the<br>forest."'
