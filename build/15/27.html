                            "Vaisampayana said, 'They passed that night which was characterised by<br>auspicious constellations even thus, O king, in that retreat of righteous<br>ascetics. The conversation that occurred was characterised by many<br>reflections on morality and wealth. Consisting of delightful and sweet<br>words, it was graced with diverse citations from the Srutis. The<br>Pandavas, O king, leaving costly beds, laid themselves down, near their<br>mother, on the bare ground. Indeed, those heroes passed that night,<br>having eaten the food which was the food of the high-souled king<br>Dhritarashtra. After the night had passed away, king Yudhishthira, having<br>gone through his morning acts, proceeded to survey that retreat in the<br>company of his brothers. With the ladies of his household the servants,<br>and his priest, the king roved about the retreat in all directions, as he<br>pleased, at the command of Dhritarashtra. He beheld many sacrificial<br>altars with sacred fires blazing on them and with many ascetics seated on<br>them, that had performed their oblations and poured libations in honour<br>of the deities. Those altars were overspread with fruits and roots of the<br>forest, and with heaps of flowers. The smoke of clarified butter curled<br>upwards from them. They were graced, besides, with many ascetics<br>possessed of bodies that looked like the embodied Vedas and with many<br>that belonged to the lay brotherhood. Herds of deer were grazing, or<br>resting here and there, freed from every fear. Innumerable birds also<br>were there, engaged in uttering their melodious notes, O king. The whole<br>forest seemed to resound with the notes of peacocks and Datyuhas and<br>Kokilas and the sweet songs of other warblers.[43] Some spots echoed with<br>the chant of Vedic hymns recited by learned Brahmanas. Some were adorned<br>with large heaps of fruits and roots gathered from the wilderness. King<br>Yudhishthira then gave those ascetics jars made of gold or copper which<br>he had brought for them, and many deer-skins and blankets and sacrificial<br>ladles made of wood, and Kamandalus and wooden platters, and pots and<br>pans, O Bharata.[44] Diverse kinds of vessels, made of iron, and smaller<br>vessels and cups of various sizes, were also given away by the king, the<br>ascetics taking them away, each as many as he liked. King Yudhishthira of<br>righteous soul, having thus roved through the woods and beheld the<br>diverse retreats of ascetics and made many gifts, returned to the place<br>where his uncle was. He saw king Dhritarashtra, that lord of Earth, at<br>his ease, with Gandhari beside him, after having finished his morning<br>rites. The righteous-souled monarch saw also his mother, Kunti, seated<br>not much remote from that place, like a disciple with bent head, endued<br>with humility. He saluted the old king, proclaiming his name. 'Sit down'<br>were the words the old king said. Receiving Dhritarashtra's permission,<br>Yudhishthira sat himself down on a mat of Kusa grass. Then the other sons<br>of Pandu with Bhima among them, O thou of Bharata's race, saluted the<br>king and touched his feet and sat themselves down, receiving his<br>permission. The old Kuru king, surrounded by them, looked exceedingly<br>beautiful. Indeed, he blazed with a Vedic splendour like Vrihaspati in<br>the midst of the celestials. After they had sat themselves down, many<br>great Rishis, viz., Satayupa and others, who were denizens of<br>Kurukshetra, came there. The illustrious and learned Vyasa, possessed of<br>great energy, and reverenced by even the celestial Rishis, showed<br>himself, at the head of his numerous disciples, unto Yudhishthira. The<br>Kuru king Dhritarashtra, Kunti's son Yudhishthira of great energy, and<br>Bhimasena and others, stood up and advancing a few steps, saluted those<br>guests. Approaching near, Vyasa, surrounded by Satayupa and others,<br>addressed king Dhritarashtra, saying,&#8212;'Be thou seated.' The illustrious<br>Vyasa then took an excellent seat made of Kusa grass placed upon a black<br>deer-skin and covered with a piece of silken cloth. They had reserved<br>that seat for him. After Vyasa had been seated, all those foremost of<br>regenerate persons, endued with abundant energy, sat themselves down,<br>having received the permission of the Island-born sage."
