                            "Vaisampayana said,&#8212;'The royal son of Amvika, viz., Dhritarashtra,<br>having settled the hour of his departure for the woods, summoned those<br>heroes, the Pandavas. Possessed of great intelligence, the old monarch,<br>with Gandhari, duly accosted those princes. Having caused the minor rites<br>to be performed, by Brahmanas conversant with the Vedas, on that day<br>which was the day of full moon in the month of Kartika, he caused the<br>fire which he worshipped daily to be taken up. Leaving his usual robes he<br>wore deer-skins and barks, and accompanied by his daughters-in-law, he<br>set out of his mansion. When the royal son of Vichitraviryya thus set<br>out, a loud wail was uttered by the Pandava and the Kaurava ladies as<br>also by other women belonging to the Kaurava race. The king worshipped<br>the mansion in which he had lived with fried paddy and excellent flowers<br>of diverse kinds. He also honoured all his servants with gifts of wealth,<br>and then leaving that abode set out on his journey. Then O son, king<br>Yudhishthira, trembling all over, with utterance choked with tears, said<br>these words in a loud voice, viz.,&#8212;'O righteous monarch, where dost thou<br>go?&#8212;and fell down in a swoon. Arjuna, burning with great grief, sighed<br>repeatedly. That foremost of Bharata princes, telling Yudhishthira that<br>he should not behave in that manner, stood cheerlessly and with heart<br>plunged into distress. Vrikodara, the heroic Phalguna, the two sons of<br>Madri, Vidura, Sanjaya, Dhritarashtra's son by his Vaisya wife, and<br>Kripa, and Dhaumya, and other Brahmanas, all followed the old monarch,<br>with voices choked in grief. Kunti walked ahead, bearing on her shoulders<br>the hand of Gandhari who walked with her bandaged eyes. King<br>Dhritarashtra walked confidently behind Gandhari, placing his hand on her<br>shoulder.[32] Drupada's daughter Krishna, she of the Sattwata race,<br>Uttara the daughter-in-law of the Kauravas, who had recently become a<br>mother, Chitrangada, and other ladies of the royal house-hold, all<br>proceeded with the old monarch. The wail they uttered on that occasion, O<br>king, from grief, resembled the loud lamentations of a swarm of<br>she-ospreys. Then the wives of the citizens,&#8212;Brahmanas and Kshatriyas<br>and Vaisyas and Sudras,&#8212;also came out into the streets from every side.<br>At Dhritarashtra's departure, O king, all the citizens of Hastinapore<br>became as distressed as they had been, O monarch, when they had witnessed<br>the departure of the Pandavas in former days after their defeat at the<br>match at dice. Ladies that had never seen the sun or the moon, came out<br>into the streets on the occasion, in great grief, when king Dhritarashtra<br>proceeded towards the great forest."'
