                            "Vaisampayana said, 'After the high-souled Pandavas had all been seated,<br>Satyavati's son Vyasa said,&#8212;O Dhritarashtra of mighty arms, hast thou<br>been able to achieve penances? Is thy mind, O king, pleased with thy<br>residence in the woods? Has the grief that was thine, born of the<br>slaughter of thy sons in battle, disappeared from thy heart? Are all thy<br>perceptions, O sinless one, now clear? Dost thou practise the ordinances<br>of forest life after having made thy heart firm? Does my daughter-in-law,<br>Gandhari, allow herself to be overwhelmed by grief? She is possessed of<br>great wisdom. Endued with intelligence, that queen understands both<br>Religion and Wealth. She is well conversant with the truths that relate<br>to both prosperity and adversity. Does she still grieve? Does Kunti, O<br>king, who in consequence of her devotion to the service of her seniors,<br>left her children, attend to thy wants and serve thee with all humility?<br>Have the high-minded and high-souled king, Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Dharma and Bhima and Arjuna and the twins been sufficiently comforted?<br>Dost thou feet delight at seeing them? Has thy mind become freed from<br>every stain? Has thy disposition, O king, become pure in consequence of<br>the increase of thy knowledge? This aggregate of three, O king, is the<br>foremost of all concerns, O Bharata, viz., abstension from injury to any<br>creature, truth, and freedom from anger. Does thy forest life any longer<br>prove painful to thee? Art thou able to earn with thy own exertions the<br>products of the wilderness for thy food? Do fasts give thee any pain now?<br>Hast thou learnt, O king, how the high-souled Vidura, who was Dharma's<br>self, left this world? Through the curse of Mandavya, the deity of<br>Righteousness became born as Vidura. He was possessed of great<br>intelligence. Endued with high penances, he was high-souled and<br>high-minded. Even Vrihaspati among the celestials, and Sukra among the<br>Asuras, was not possessed of such intelligence as that foremost of<br>persons. The eternal deity of Righteousness was stupefied by the Rishi<br>Mandavya with an expenditure of his penances earned for a long time with<br>great care.[45] At the command of the Grandsire, and through my own<br>energy, Vidura of great intelligence was procreated by me upon a soil<br>owned by Vichitraviryya. A deity of deities, and eternal, he was, O king,<br>thy brother. The learned know him to be Dharma in consequence of his<br>practices of Dharana and Dhyana.[46] He grows with (the growth of) truth,<br>self-restraint, tranquillity of heart, compassion, and gifts. He is<br>always engaged in penances, and is eternal. From that deity of<br>Righteousness, through Yoga-puissance, the Kuru king Yudhishthira also<br>took his birth. Yudhishthira, therefore, O king, is Dharma of great<br>wisdom and immeasurable intelligence. Dharma exists both here and<br>hereafter, and is like fire or wind or water or earth or space. He is, O<br>king of kings, capable of going everywhere and exists, pervading the<br>whole universe. He is capable of being beheld by only those that are the<br>foremost of the deities and those that are cleansed of every sin and<br>crowned with ascetic success. He that is Dharma is Vidura; and he that is<br>Vidura is the (eldest) son of Pandu. That son of Pandu. O king, is<br>capable of being perceived by thee. He stays before thee as thy servitor.<br>Endued with great Yoga-puissance, thy high-souled brother, that foremost<br>of intelligent men, seeing the high-souled Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Kunti, has entered into his person. These also, O chief of Bharata's<br>race, I shall unite with great benefit. Know, O son, that I am come here<br>for dispelling thy doubts. Some feat that has never been accomplished<br>before by any of the great Rishis, some wonderful effect of my<br>penances,&#8212;I shall show thee. What object is that, O king, whose<br>accomplishment thou desirest from me? Tell me what is that which thou<br>wishest to see or ask or hear? O sinless one, I shall accomplish it.'
