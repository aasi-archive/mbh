                            "Kunti said, 'O holy one, thou art my father-in-law and therefore, my<br>deity of deities. Verily, thou art my god of gods. Hear my words of<br>truth. An ascetic named Durvasas, who is of the regenerate order and who<br>is full of wrath, came to my father's house for eleemosynary charity. I<br>succeeded in gratifying him by the purity of my external behaviour and of<br>my mind, as also by refusing to notice the many wrongs he did. I did not<br>give way to wrath although there was much in his behaviour quite capable<br>of exciting that passion. Served with care, the great ascetic became<br>highly pleased with me and disposed to grant me a boon. 'Thou must accept<br>the boon I shall give,' were his words to me. Fearing his curse, I<br>answered him, saying,&#8212;'So be it.' The regenerate Rishi once more said<br>unto me,&#8212;'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become<br>the mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be<br>obedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished<br>away from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,<br>which the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,<br>sitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the<br>maker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any<br>consciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere<br>girlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)<br>came to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was<br>in the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.<br>With one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,<br>while I was trembling at his sight, these words,&#8212;'Do thou ask a boon of<br>me.' Bowing unto him with my head, I asked him to leave me. He replied<br>unto me, saying,&#8212;'I cannot bear the idea of coming to thee fruitlessly.<br>I shall consume thee as also that Brahmana who gave thee the Mantra as a<br>boon.' The Brahmana who had done no evil&#8212;I wished to protect from<br>Surya's curse. I therefore, said&#8212;'Let me have a son like thee, O god.'<br>The deity of thousand rays then penetrated me with his energy and<br>stupefied me completely. He then said unto me,&#8212;'Thou wilt have a son,'<br>and then went back to the firmament. I continued to live in the inner<br>apartments and desirous of saying the honour of my sire, I cast into the<br>waters my infant son named Karna who thus came into the world secretly.<br>Without doubt, through the grace of that god, I once more became a<br>virgin, O regenerate one, even as the Rishi Durvasas had said unto me.<br>Foolish that I am, although he knew me for his mother when he grew up, I<br>yet made no effort to acknowledge him. This burns me, O regenerate Rishi,<br>as is well-known to thee. Whether it is sinful or not so, I have told<br>thee truth. It behoveth thee, O holy one, to gratify the craving I feel<br>for beholding that son of mine. O foremost of ascetics, let this king<br>also, O sinless one, obtain the fruition today of that wish of his which<br>he cherishes in his bosom and which has become known to thee.' Thus<br>addressed by Kunti, Vyasa, that foremost of all persons, said unto her in<br>reply,&#8212;'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.<br>(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert<br>restored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.<br>They are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They<br>beget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by<br>sexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou<br>belongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what<br>happened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.<br>For those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are<br>mighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is<br>meritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'"
