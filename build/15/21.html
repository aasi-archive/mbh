                            " Vaisampayana said, 'Upon the retirement of the chief of the Kurus into<br>the forest, the Pandavas, O king, afflicted besides by grief on account<br>of their mother, became very cheerless. The citizens also of Hastinapura<br>were possessed by deep sorrow. The Brahmanas always talked of the old<br>king. 'How, indeed, will the king, who has become old, live in the<br>solitary woods? How will the highly blessed Gandhari, and Pritha, the<br>daughter of Kuntibhoja, live there? The royal sage has always lived in<br>the enjoyment of every comfort. He will certainly be very miserable.<br>Arrived in deep woods, what is now the condition of that personage of<br>royal descent, who is, again, bereft of vision? Difficult is the feat<br>that Kunti has achieved by separating herself from her sons. Alas casting<br>off kingly prosperity, she chose a life in the woods. What, again, is the<br>condition of Vidura who is always devoted to the service of his elder<br>brother? How also is the intelligent son of Gavalgani who is so faithful<br>to the food given him by his master? Verily, the citizens, including<br>those of even nonage meeting together, asked one another these questions.<br>The Pandavas also, exceedingly afflicted with grief, sorrowed for their<br>old mother, and could not live in their city long, Thinking also of their<br>old sire, the king, who had lost all his children, and the highly blessed<br>Gandhari, and Vidura of great intelligence, they failed to enjoy peace of<br>mind. They had no pleasure in sovereignty, nor in women, nor in the study<br>of the Vedas. Despair penetrated their souls as they thought of the old<br>king and as they repeatedly reflected on that terrible slaughter of<br>kinsmen. Indeed, thinking of the slaughter of the youthful Abhimanyu on<br>the field of battle, of the mighty-armed Karna who never retreated from<br>the fray, of the sons of Draupadi, and of other friends of theirs, those<br>heroes became exceedingly cheerless. They failed to obtain peace or mind<br>upon repeatedly reflecting that the Earth had become divested of both her<br>heroes and her wealth. Draupadi had lost all her children, and the<br>beautiful Subhadra also had become childless. They too were of cheerless<br>hearts and grieved exceedingly. Beholding, however, the son of Virata's<br>daughter, viz., thy sire Parikshit, thy grandsires somehow held their<br>life-breaths.'
