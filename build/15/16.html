                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Great was the uproar, at that time, O king, of both<br>men and women standing on the terraces of mansions or on the Earth.<br>Possessed of great intelligence, the old king, with joined hands, and<br>trembling with weakness, proceeded with difficulty along the principal<br>street which was crowded with persons of both sexes. He left the city<br>called after the elephant by the principal gate and then repeatedly bade<br>that crowd of people to return to their homes. Vidura had set his heart<br>on going to the forest along with the king. The Suta Sanjaya also, the<br>son of Gavalgani, the chief minister of Dhritarashtra, was of the same<br>heart. King Dhritarashtra however, caused Kripa and the mighty<br>car-warrior Yuyutsu to refrain from following him. He made them over into<br>Yudhishthira's hands. After the citizens had ceased following the<br>monarch, king Yudhishthira, with the ladies of his house-hold, prepared<br>to stop, at the command of Dhritarashtra. seeing that his mother Kunti<br>was desirous of retiring into the woods, the king said unto her, 'I shall<br>follow the old monarch. Do thou desist.' It behoveth thee, O queen, to<br>return to the city, accompanied by these thy daughters-in-law. This<br>monarch proceeds to the woods, firmly resolved to practise penances.<br>Though king Yudhishthira said these words unto her, with his eyes bathed<br>in tears, Kunti, however, without answering him, continued to proceed,<br>catching hold of Gandhari.<br><br>"Kunti said, 'O king, never show any disregard for Sahadeva. He is very<br>much attached to me, O monarch, and to thee also always. Thou shouldst<br>always bear in mind Karna who never retreated from battle. Through my<br>folly that hero has been slain in the field of battle. Surely, my son,<br>this heart of mine is made of steel, since it does not break into a<br>hundred pieces at not seeing that child born of Surya. When such has been<br>the case, O chastiser of foes, what can I now do? I am very much to blame<br>for not having proclaimed the truth about the birth of Surya's child. O<br>crusher of foes, I hope thou wilt, with all thy brothers, make excellent<br>gifts for the sake of that son of Surya. O mower of foes, thou shouldst<br>always do what is agreeable to Draupadi. Thou shouldst look after<br>Bhimasena and Arjuna and Nakula and Sahadeva. The burthens of the Kuru<br>race have now fallen on thee, O king. I shall live in the woods with<br>Gandhari, besmearing my body with filth, engaged in the performance of<br>penances, and devoted to the service of my father-in-law and<br>mother-in-law.'[33]<br><br>'Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by her, the righteous-souled<br>Yudhishthira, with passions under complete control, became, with all his<br>brothers, plunged into great distress. Endued with great intelligence,<br>the king said not a word. Having reflected for a little while, king<br>Yudhishthira the Just, cheerless and plunged in anxiety and sorrow,<br>addressed his mother, saying,&#8212;'Strange, indeed, is this purpose of<br>thine? It behoves thee not to accomplish it. I can never grant thee<br>permission. It behoves thee to show us compassion. 'Formerly, when we<br>were about to set out of Hastinapore for the woods, O thou of agreeable<br>features, it was thou who, reciting to us the story of Vidula's<br>instructions to her son, excited us to exertion. It behoves thee not to<br>abandon us now. Having slain the kings of Earth, I have won sovereignty,<br>guided by thy words of wisdom communicated through Vasudeva. Where now is<br>that understanding of thine about which I had heard from Vasudeva? Dost<br>thou wish now to fall away from those Kshatriya practices about which<br>thou hadst instructed us? Abandoning ourselves, this kingdom, and this<br>daughter-in-law of thine who is possessed of great fame, how wilt thou<br>live in the inaccessible woods? Do thou relent! Kunti, with tears in her<br>eyes, heard these words of her son, but continued to proceed on her way.<br>Then Bhima addressed her, saying,&#8212;'When, O Kunti, sovereignty has been<br>won, and when the time has come for thee to enjoy that sovereignty thus<br>acquired by thy children, when the duties of royalty await discharge by<br>thee, whence has this desire got hold of thy mind? Why then didst thou<br>cause us to exterminate the Earth? For what reason wouldst thou leave all<br>and wish to take up thy abode in the woods? We were born in the woods.<br>Why then didst thou bring us from the woods while we were children?<br>Behold, the two sons of Madri are overwhelmed with sorrow and grief.<br>Relent, O mother, O thou of great fame, do not go into the woods now. Do<br>thou enjoy that prosperity which acquired by might, has become<br>Yudhishthira's today.' Firmly resolved to retire into the woods, Kunti<br>disregarded these lamentations of her sons. Then Draupadi with a<br>cheerless face, accompanied by Subhadra, followed her weeping<br>mother-in-law who was journeying on from desire of going into the woods.<br>Possessed of great wisdom and firmly resolved on retirement from the<br>world, the blessed dame walked on, frequently looking at her weeping<br>children. The Pandavas, with all their wives and servitors, continued to<br>follow her. Restraining then her tears, she addressed her children in<br>these words.'"
