                            "Vaisampayana said, 'King Dhritarashtra had never beheld his own sons.<br>Obtaining eye-sight through the grace of the Rishi, he beheld, for the<br>first time, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, those children of his that were<br>very like his own self. That foremost of men, viz., the Kuru monarch, had<br>learnt all the duties of kings, as also the Vedas and the Upanishadas,<br>and had acquired certitude of understanding (from the same source).<br>Vidura of great wisdom attained to high success through the power of his<br>penances. Dhritarashtra also attained to great success in consequence of<br>having met the ascetic Vyasa.'<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'If Vyasa, disposed to grant me a boon, kindly show me<br>my sire in that form which he had, clad as he used to be clad, and as old<br>as he was when he departed from this world, I may then believe all that<br>thou hast told me. Such a sight will be most agreeable to me. Indeed, I<br>shall regard myself crowned with success. I shall have gained a certainty<br>of conclusion. O, let my wish be crowned with fruition through the grace<br>of that foremost of Rishis.'<br><br>"Sauti said,&#8212;'After king Janamejaya had said these words, Vyasa of great<br>energy and intelligence showed his grace and brought Parikshit (from the<br>other world). King Janamejaya beheld his royal father, possessed of great<br>beauty, brought down from Heaven, in the same form that he had and of the<br>same age as he was (at the time of leaving this world). The high-souled<br>Samika also, and his son Sringin, were similarly brought there. All the<br>counsellors and ministers of the king beheld them. King Janamejaya.<br>performing the final bath in his sacrifice, became highly glad. He poured<br>the sacred water on his father, even as he caused it to be poured on<br>himself. Having undergone the final bath, the king addressed the<br>regenerate Astika who had sprung from the race of the Yayavaras and who<br>was the son of Jaratkaru, and said these words,&#8212;'O Astika, this<br>sacrifice of mine is fraught with many wonderful incidents, since this my<br>sire has been seen by me&#8212;he who has dispelled all my sorrows.'<br><br>"Astika said, 'The performer of that sacrifice in which the ancient<br>Rishi, the Island-born Vyasa, that vast receptacle of penances, is<br>present, is sure, O foremost one of Kuru's race, to conquer both the<br>worlds. O son of the Pandavas, thou hast heard a wonderful history. The<br>snakes have been consumed into ashes and have followed the footsteps of<br>thy sire. Through thy truthfulness, O monarch, Takshaka has with<br>difficulty escaped a painful fate. The Rishis have all been worshipped.<br>Thou hast seen also the end that has been attained by thy high-souled<br>sire. Having heard this sin-cleansing history thou hast achieved abundant<br>merit. The knots of thy heart have been untied through sight of this<br>foremost of person. They that are the supporters of the wings of<br>Righteousness, they that are of good conduct and excellent disposition,<br>they at sight of whom sins become attenuated,&#8212;we should all bow to them.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Having heard this from that foremost of regenerate<br>ones, King Janamejaya worshipped that Rishi, repeatedly honouring him in<br>every way. Conversant with all duties he then asked the Rishi<br>Vaisampayana of unfading glory about the sequel, O best of ascetics, of<br>king Dhritarashtra's residence in the woods.'"
