                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having received the king's permission, king<br>Dhritarashtra of great energy then proceeded to his own palace, followed<br>by Gandhari. With weakened strength and slow motion, that king of great<br>intelligence walked with difficulty, like the leader, worn out with age,<br>of an elephantine herd. He was followed by Vidura of great learning, and<br>his charioteer Sanjaya, as also that mighty bowman Kripa, the son of<br>Saradwata. Entering his mansion, O king, he went through the morning<br>rites and after gratifying many foremost of Brahmanas he took some food.<br>Gandhari conversant with every duty, as also Kunti of great intelligence,<br>worshipped with offers of various articles by their daughters-in-law,<br>then took some food, O Bharata. After Dhritarashtra had eaten, and Vidura<br>also and others had done the same, the Pandavas, having finished their<br>meals, approached and sat around the old king. Then the son of Amvika, O<br>monarch, addressing Kunti's son who was seated near him and touching his<br>back with his hand, said, 'Thou shouldst always, O delighter of the<br>Kurus, act without heedlessness as regards everything connected with thy<br>kingdom consisting of eight limbs, O foremost of rulers, and in which the<br>claims of righteousness should ever be kept foremost.[7] Thou art<br>possessed, O son of Kunti, of intelligence and learning. Listen to me, O<br>king, as I tell thee what the means are by which, O son of Pandu, the<br>kingdom is capable of being righteously protected. Thou shouldst always,<br>O Yudhishthira, honour those persons that are old in learning. Thou<br>shouldst listen to what they would say, and act accordingly without any<br>scruple. Rising at dawn, O king, worship them with due rites, and when<br>the time comes for action, thou shouldst consult them about thy<br>(intended) acts. When, led by the desire of knowing what would be<br>beneficial to thee in respect of thy measures, thou honourest them; they<br>will, O son, always declare what is for thy good, O Bharata. Thou<br>shouldst always keep thy senses, as thou keepest thy horses. They will<br>then prove beneficial to thee, like wealth that is not wasted. Thou<br>shouldst employ only such ministers as have passed the tests of honesty,<br>(i.e., as are possessed of loyalty, disinterestedness, continence, and<br>courage), as are hereditary officers of state, possessed of pure conduct,<br>self-restrained, clever in the discharge of business, and endued with<br>righteous conduct. Thou shouldst always collect information through spies<br>in diverse disguises, whose faithfulness have been tasted, who are<br>natives of thy kingdom, and who should not be known to thy foes. Thy<br>citadel should be properly protected with strong walls and arched gates.<br>On every side the walls, with watch-towers on them standing close to one<br>another, should be such as to admit of six persons walking side by side<br>on their top.[8] The gates should all be large and sufficiently strong.<br>Kept in proper places those gates should be carefully guarded. Let thy<br>purposes be accomplished through men whose families and conduct are well<br>known. Thou shouldst always protect thy person also with care, in matters<br>connected with thy food, O Bharata, as also in the hours of sport and<br>eating and in matters connected with the garlands thou wearest and the<br>beds thou liest upon. The ladies of thy household should be properly<br>protected, looked over by aged and trusted servitors, of good behaviour,<br>well-born, and possessed of learning, O Yudhishthira. Thou shouldst make<br>ministers of Brahmanas possessed of learning, endued with humility,<br>well-born, conversant with religion and wealth, and adorned with<br>simplicity of behaviour. Thou shouldst hold consultations with them. Thou<br>shouldst not, however, admit many persons into thy consultations. On<br>particular occasions thou mayst consult with the whole of thy council or<br>with a portion of it. Entering a chamber or spot that is well protected<br>(from intruders) thou shouldst hold thy consultation. Thou mayst hold thy<br>consultation in a forest that is divested of grass. Thou shouldst never<br>consult at night time.[9] Apes and birds and other animals that can<br>imitate human beings should all be excluded from the council chamber, as<br>also idiots and lame and palsied individuals. I think that the evils that<br>flow from the divulgence of the counsels of kings are such that they<br>cannot be remedied. Thou shouldst repeatedly refer, in the midst of thy<br>counsellors, to the evils that arise from the divulgence of counsels, O<br>chastiser of foes, and to the merits that flow from counsels properly<br>kept. Thou shouldst, O Yudhishthira, act in such a manner as to ascertain<br>the merits and faults of the inhabitants of thy city and the provinces.<br>Let thy laws, O king, be always administered by trusted judges placed in<br>charge thereof, who should also be contented and of good behaviour. Their<br>acts should also be ascertained by thee through spies. Let thy judicial<br>officers, O Yudhishthira, inflict punishments, according to the law, on<br>offenders after careful ascertainment of the gravity of the offences.<br>They that are disposed to take bribes, they that are the violators of the<br>chastity of other people's wives, they that inflict heavy punishments,<br>they that are utterers of false speeches, they that are revilers, they<br>that are stained by cupidity, they that are murderers, they that are<br>doers of rash deeds, they that are disturbers of assemblies and the<br>sports of others, and they that bring about a confusion of castes,<br>should, agreeably to considerations of time and place, be punished with<br>either fines or death.[10] In the morning thou shouldst see those that<br>are employed in making thy disbursements. After that thou shouldst look<br>to thy toilet and then to thy food. Thou shouldst next supervise thy<br>forces, gladdening them on every occasion. Thy evenings should be set<br>apart for envoys and spies. The latter end of the night should be devoted<br>by thee to settle what acts should be done by thee in the day. Mid-nights<br>and mid-days should be devoted to thy amusements and sports. At all<br>times, however thou shouldst think of the means for accomplishing thy<br>purposes. At the proper time, adorning thy person, thou shouldst sit<br>prepared to make gifts in profusion. The turns for different acts, O son,<br>ceaselessly revolve like wheels. Thou shouldst always exert thyself to<br>fill thy treasuries of various kinds by lawful means. Thou shouldst avoid<br>all unlawful means towards that end. Ascertaining through thy spies who<br>thy foes are that are bent on finding out thy laches, thou shouldst,<br>through trusted agents, cause them to be destroyed from a distance.<br>Examining their conduct, thou shouldst O perpetuator of Kuru's race,<br>appoint thy servants. Thou shouldst cause all thy acts to be accomplished<br>through thy servitors: whether they are appointed for those acts or not.<br>The commandant of thy forces should be of firm conduct, courageous,<br>capable of bearing hardships, loyal, and devoted to thy good. Artisans<br>and mechanics, O son of Pandu, dwelling in thy provinces, should always<br>do thy acts like kine and asses.[11] Thou shouldst always, O<br>Yudhishthira, be careful to ascertain thy own laches as also those of thy<br>foes. The laches also of thy own men as also of the men of thy foes<br>should equally be ascertained. Those men of thy kingdom, that are well<br>skilled in their respective vocations, and are devoted to thy good,<br>should be favoured by thee with adequate means of support. A wise king, O<br>ruler of men, should always see that the accomplishments of his<br>accomplished subjects might be kept up. They would then be firmly devoted<br>to thee, seeing that they did not fall away from their skill.'"
