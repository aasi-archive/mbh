                            "Vaisampayana said, 'After that night had passed away, Dhritarashtra, the<br>son of Amvika, despatched Vidura to Yudhishthira's mansion. Endued with<br>great energy and the foremost of all persons possessed of intelligence,<br>Vidura, having arrived at Yudhishthira's mansion, addressed that foremost<br>of men, that king of unfading glory, in these words, 'King Dhritarashtra<br>has undergone the preliminary rites for accomplishing his purpose of<br>retiring into the woods. He will set out for the woods, O king, on the<br>coming day of full moon of the month of Kartika. He now solicits from<br>thee, O foremost one of Kuru's race, some wealth. He wishes to perform<br>the Sraddha of the high-souled son of Ganga, as also of Drona and<br>Somadatta and Valhika of great intelligence, and of all his sons as also<br>of all well-wishers of his that have been slain, and, if thou permittest<br>it, of that wicked-souled wight, viz., the ruler of the Sindhus.'[29]<br>Hearing these words of Vidura, both Yudhishthira, and Pandit's son Arjuna<br>of curly hair, became very glad and applauded them highly. Bhima,<br>however, of great energy and unappeasable wrath, did not accept those<br>words of Vidura in good spirits, recollecting the acts of Duryodhana. The<br>diadem-decked Phalguna, understanding the thoughts of Bhimasena, slightly<br>bending his face downwards, addressed that foremost of men in these<br>words, 'O Bhima, our royal father who is advancing in years, has resolved<br>to retire into the woods. He wishes to make gifts for advancing the<br>happiness of his slain kinsmen and well-wishers now in the other world. O<br>thou of Kuru's race, he wishes to give away wealth that belongs to thee<br>by conquest. Indeed, O mighty-armed one, it is for Bhishma and others<br>that the old king is desirous of making those gifts. It behoves thee to<br>grant thy permission. By good luck it is, O thou of mighty arms that<br>Dhritarashtra today begs wealth of us, he who was formerly begged by us.<br>Behold the reverse brought about by Time. That king who was before the<br>lord and protector of the whole Earth, now desires to go into the woods,<br>his kinsmen and associates all slain by foes. O chief of men, let not thy<br>views deviate from granting the permission asked for. O mighty-armed one,<br>refusal, besides bringing infamy, will be productive d demerit. Do thou<br>learn your duty in this matter from the king, thy eldest brother, who is<br>lord of all. It becometh thee to give instead of refusing, O chief of<br>Bharata's race. Vibhatsu who was saying so wag applauded by king<br>Yudhishthira the just. Yielding to wrath, Bhimasena said these words, 'O<br>Phalguna, it is we that shall make gifts in the matter of Bhishma's<br>obsequies, as also of king Somadatta and of Bhurisravas, of the royal<br>sage Valhika, and of the high-souled Drona, and of all others. Our mother<br>Kunti shall make such obsequial offerings for Karna. O foremost of men,<br>let not Dhritarashtra perform those Sraddhas. Even this is what I think.<br>Let not our foes be gladdened. Let Duryodhana and others sink from a<br>miserable to a more miserable position. Alas, it was those wretches of<br>their race that caused the whole Earth to be exterminated. How hast thou<br>been able to forget that anxiety of twelve long years, and our residence<br>in deep incognito that was so painful to Draupadi? Where was<br>Dhritarashtra's affection for us then? Clad in a black deer-skin and<br>divested of all thy ornaments, with the princess of Panchala in thy<br>company, didst thou not follow this king? Where were Bhishma and Drona<br>then, and where was Somadatta? Thou hadst to live for thirteen years in<br>the woods, supporting thyself on the products of the wilderness. Thy<br>eldest father did not then look at thee with eyes of parental affection.<br>Hast thou forgotten, O Partha, that it was this wretch of our race, of<br>wicked understanding, that enquired of Vidura, when the match at dice was<br>going on,&#8212;'What has been won?' Hearing thus far, king Yudhishthira, the<br>son of Kunti, endued with great intelligence, rebuked him and told him to<br>be silent."'
