                            "Vyasa said, 'O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, do without any scruple what<br>Dhritarashtra of Kuru's race hag said. This king is old. He has, again,<br>been made sonless. I think he will not be able to bear his grief long.<br>The highly blessed Gandhari, possessed of great wisdom and endued with<br>kindly speech, bears with fortitude her excessive grief owing to the logs<br>of her song. I also tell thee (what the old king says). Do thou obey my<br>words. Let the old king have thy permission. Let him not die an<br>inglorious death at home. Let this king follow the path of all royal<br>sages of old. Verily, for all royal sages, retirement into the woods<br>comes at last.'"<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed at that time by Vyasa of wonderful<br>deeds, king Yudhishthira the just, possessed of mighty energy, said unto<br>the great ascetic these words, 'Thy holy self is held by us in great<br>reverence. Thou alone art our preceptor. Thou alone art the refuge of<br>this our kingdom as also of our race. I am thy son. Thou, O holy one, art<br>my father. Thou art our king, and thou art our preceptor. The son should,<br>agreeably to every duty, be obedient to the commands of his sire.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by the king. Vyasa, that<br>foremost of poets, foremost of all persons conversant with the Vedas,<br>endued with great energy once more said unto Yudhishthira these words,<br>'It is even so, O mighty-armed one. It is even as thou sayest, O Bharata.<br>This king has reached old age. He is now in the last stage of life.<br>Permitted both by me and thee, let this lord of Earth do what he<br>proposes. Do not stand as an impediment in his way. Even this is the<br>highest duty, O Yudhishthira, of royal sages. They should die either in<br>battle or in the woods agreeably to the scriptures. Thy royal sire,<br>Pandu, O king of kings, reverenced this old king as a disciple reverences<br>his preceptor. (At that time) he adored the gods in many great sacrifices<br>with profuse gifts consisting of hills of wealth and jewels, and ruled<br>the Earth and protected his subjects wisely and well. Having obtained a<br>large progeny and a swelling kingdom, he enjoyed great influence for<br>thirteen years while you were in exile, and gave away much wealth.<br>Thyself also, O chief of men, with thy servants, O sinless one, hast<br>adored this king and the famous Gandhari with that ready obedience which.<br>a disciple pays to his preceptor. Do thou grant permission to thy father.<br>The time has come for him to attend to the practice of penances. He does<br>not harbour, O Yudhishthira, even the slightest anger against any of you.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said these words, Vyasa soothed the old<br>king. Yudhishthira then answered him, saying, 'So be it.' The great<br>ascetic then left the palace for proceeding to the woods. After the holy<br>Vyasa had gone away, the royal son of Pandu softly said these words unto<br>his old father, bending himself in humility,&#8212;What the holy Vyasa has<br>said, what is thy own purpose, what the great bowman Kripa has said, what<br>Vidura has expressed, and what has been asked for by Yuyutsu and Sanjaya,<br>I shall accomplish with speed. All these are worthy of my respect, for<br>all of them are well-wishers of our race. This, however, O king, I beg of<br>thee by bending my head. Do thou first eat and afterwards go to thy<br>forest retreat.'"
