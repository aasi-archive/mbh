                            "Dhritarashtra said. 'O Yudhishthira, art thou in peace and happiness,<br>with all thy brothers and the inhabitants of the city and the provinces?<br>Are they that live in dependance on thee also happy? Are they ministers,<br>and servitors, and all thy seniors and preceptors also, happy? Are those<br>also that live in thy dominions free from fear? Dost thou follow the old<br>and traditional conduct of rulers of men? Is thy treasury filled without<br>disregarding the restraints imposed by justice and equity? Dost thou<br>behave as thou shouldst towards foes, neutrals, and allies? Dost thou<br>duly look after the Brahmanas, always making them the first gifts<br>(ordained in sacrifices and religious rites)? What need I say of the<br>citizens, and thy servants, and kinsmen,&#8212;are they foes, O chief of<br>Bharata's race, gratified with thy behaviour? Dost thou, O king of kings,<br>adore with devotion the Pitris and the deities? Dost thou worship guests<br>with food and drink, O Bharata? Do the Brahmanas in thy dominions,<br>devoted to the duties of their order, walk along the path of<br>righteousness? Do the Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras also within thy<br>kingdom, and all thy relatives, observe their respective duties? I hope<br>the women, the children, and the old, among thy subjects, do not grieve<br>(under distress) and do not beg (the necessaries of life). Are the ladies<br>of thy household duly honoured in thy house, O best of men? I hope, O<br>monarch, that this race of royal sages, having obtained thee for their<br>king, have not fallen away from fame and glory.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Unto the old king who said so, Yudhishthira,<br>conversant with morality and justice, and well-skilled in acts and<br>speech, spoke as follows, putting some questions about his welfare.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Doth thy peace, O king, thy self-restraint, thy<br>tranquillity of heart, grow? Is this my mother able to serve thee without<br>fatigue and trouble? Will, O king, her residence in the woods be<br>productive of fruits? I hope this queen, who is my eldest mother, who is<br>emaciated with (exposure to) cold and wind and the toil of walking, and<br>who is now devoted to the practice of severe austerities, no longer gives<br>way, to grief for her children of mighty energy, all of whom, devoted to<br>the duties of the Kshatriya order, have been slain on the field of<br>battle. Does she accuse us, sinful wretches, that are responsible for<br>their slaughter? Where is Vidura, O king? We do not see him here. I hope<br>this Sanjaya, observant of penances, is in peace and happiness.<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, Dhritarashtra answered king<br>Yudhishthira, saying,&#8212;'O son. Vidura is well. He is performing austere<br>penances, subsisting on air alone, for he abstains from all other food.<br>He is emaciated and his arteries and nerves have become visible.<br>Sometimes he is seen in this empty forest by Brahmanas.' While<br>Dhritarashtra was saying this Vidura was seen at a distance. He had<br>matted locks on his head, and gravels in his mouth, and was exceedingly<br>emaciated. He was perfectly naked. His body was besmeared all over with<br>filth, and with the dust of various wild flowers. When Kshattri was<br>beheld from a distance, the fact was reported to Yudhishthira. Vidura<br>suddenly stopped, O king, casting his eyes towards the retreat (and<br>seeing it peopled by so many individuals). King Yudhishthira pursued him<br>alone, as he ran and entered the deep forest, sometimes not seen by the<br>pursuer. He said aloud, 'O Vidura, O Vidura, I am king Yudhishthira, thy<br>favourite!'&#8212;Exclaiming thus, Yudhishthira, with great exertion, followed<br>Vidura. That foremost of intelligent men, viz., Vidura, having reached a<br>solitary spot in the forest, stood still, leaning against a tree. He was<br>exceedingly emaciated. He retained only the shape of a human being (all<br>his characteristic features having totally disappeared). Yudhishthira of<br>great intelligence recognised him, however, (in spite of such change).<br>Standing before him, Yudhishthira addressed him, saying, 'I am<br>Yudhishthira!' Indeed, worshipping Vidura properly, Yudhishthira said<br>these words in the hearing of Vidura. Meanwhile Vidura eyed the king with<br>a steadfast gaze. Casting his gaze thus on the king, he stood motionless<br>in Yoga. Possessed of great intelligence, he then (by his Yoga-power)<br>entered the body of Yudhishthira, limb by limb. He united his<br>life-breaths with the king's life-breaths, and his senses with the king's<br>senses. Verify, with the aid of Yoga-power, Vidura, blazing with energy,<br>thus entered the body of king Yudhishthira the just. Meanwhile, the body<br>of Vidura continued to lean against the tree, with eyes fixed in a<br>steadfast gaze. The king soon saw that life had fled out of it. At the<br>same time, he felt that he himself had become stronger than before and<br>that he had acquired many additional virtues and accomplishments.<br>Possessed of great learning and energy, O monarch, Pandu's son, king<br>Yudhishthira the just, then recollected his own state before his birth<br>among men.[42] Endued with mighty energy, he had heard of Yoga practice<br>from Vyasa. King Yudhishthira the just, possessed of great learning,<br>became desirous of doing the last rites to the body of Vidura, and wished<br>to cremate it duly. An invisible voice was then heard,&#8212;saying,&#8212;'O king,<br>this body that belonged to him called Vidura should not be cremated. In<br>him is thy body also. He is the eternal deity of Righteousness. Those<br>regions of felicity which are known by the name of Santanika will be his,<br>O Bharata. He was an observer of the duties of Yatis. Thou shouldst not,<br>O scorcher of foes, grieve for him at all. Thus addressed, king<br>Yudhishthira the just, returned from that spot, and represented<br>everything unto the royal son of Vichitraviryya. At this, that king of<br>great splendour, all these men, and Bhimasena and others, became filled<br>with wonder. Hearing what had happened, king Dhritarashtra became pleased<br>and then, addressing the son of Dharma. said,&#8212;'Do thou accept from me<br>these gifts of water and roots and fruits. It has been said, O king, that<br>one's guest should take that which one takes oneself.' Thus addressed,<br>Dharma's son answered the king, saying,&#8212;'So be it.' The mighty-armed<br>king ate the fruits and roots which the monarch gave him. Then they all<br>spread their beds under a tree and passed that night thus, having eaten<br>fruits and roots and drunk the water that the old king had given them."'
