                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed, O thou of Kuru's race, by the old<br>king, the citizens and the inhabitants of the provinces stood sometime<br>like men deprived of consciousness. King Dhritarashtra, finding them<br>silent, with their throats choked by grief, once more addressed them,<br>saying, 'Ye best of men, old as I am, sonless, and indulging, through<br>cheerlessness of heart, in diverse lamentations along with this my wedded<br>wife, I have obtained the permission, in the matter of my retirement into<br>the forest, of my sire, the Island-born Krishna himself, as also of king<br>Yudhishthira, who is conversant with every duty, ye righteous denizens of<br>this kingdom. Ye sinless ones, I, with Gandhari, repeatedly solicit you<br>with bent heads. It behoves you all to grant us permission.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these pitiable words of the Kuru king,<br>O monarch, the assembled denizens of Kurujangala all began to weep.<br>Covering their faces with their hands and upper garments, all those men<br>burning with grief, wept for a while as fathers and mothers would weep<br>(at the prospect of a dear son about to leave them for ever). Bearing in<br>their hearts, from which every other thought had been dispelled, the<br>sorrow born of Dhritarashtra's desire to leave the world, they looked<br>like men deprived of all consciousness. Checking that agitation of heart<br>due to the announcement of Dhritarashtra's desire of going to the forest,<br>they gradually were able to address one another, expressing their wishes.<br>Settling their words in brief, O king, they charged a certain Brahmana<br>with the task of replying unto the old monarch. That learned Brahmana, of<br>good behaviour, chosen by unanimous consent, conversant with all topics,<br>master of all the Richs, and named Samba, endeavoured to speak. Taking<br>the permission of the whole assembly and with its full approbation, that<br>learned Brahmana of great intelligence, conscious of his own abilities,<br>said these words unto the king,&#8212;'O monarch, the answer of this assembly<br>has been committed to my care. I shall voice it, O hero. Do thou receive<br>it, O king. What thou gayest, O king of kings, is all true, O puissant<br>one. There is nothing in it that is even slightly untrue. Thou art our<br>well-wisher, as, indeed, we are thine. Verily, in this race of kings,<br>there never wag a king who coming to rule his subjects became unpopular<br>with them. Ye have ruled us like fathers or brothers. King Duryodhana<br>never did us any wrong. Do that, O king, which that righteous-souled<br>ascetic, the son of Satyavati, has said. He is, verily, our foremost of<br>instructors. Left by thee, O monarch, we shall have to pass our days in<br>grief and sorrow, filled with remembrance of thy hundreds of virtues. We<br>were well protected and ruled by king Duryodhana even as we had been<br>ruled by king Santanu, or by Chitrangada, or by thy father, O monarch,<br>who was protected by the prowess of Bhishma, or by Pandu, that ruler of<br>Earth, who was overlooked by thee in all his acts. Thy son, O monarch,<br>never did us the slightest wrong. We lived, relying on that king as<br>trustfully as on our own father. It is known to thee how we lived (under<br>that ruler). After the same manner, we have enjoyed great happiness, O<br>monarch, for thousands of years, under the rule of Kunti's son of great<br>intelligence and wisdom[27]. This righteous-souled king who performs<br>sacrifices with gifts in profusion, follows the conduct of the royal<br>sages of old, belonging to thy race, of meritorious deeds, having Kuru<br>and Samvara and others and Bharata of great intelligence among them.<br>There is nothing, O monarch, that is even slightly censurable in the<br>matter of this Yudhishthira's rule. Protected and ruled by thee, we have<br>all lived in great happiness. The slightest demerit is incapable of being<br>alleged against thee and thy son. Regarding what thou hast said about<br>Duryodhana in the matter of this carnage of kinsmen, I beg thee, O<br>delighter of the Kurus (to listen to me).'<br><br>"The Brahmana continued, 'The destruction that has overtaken the Kurus<br>was not brought about by Duryodhana. It was not brought about by thee.<br>Nor was it brought about by Karna and Suvala's son. We know that it was<br>brought about by destiny, and that it was incapable of being<br>counteracted. Verily, destiny is not capable of being resisted by human<br>exertion. Eight and ten Akshauhinis of troops, O monarch, were brought<br>together. In eight and ten days that host was destroyed by the foremost<br>of Kuru warriors, viz., Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and others, and the<br>high-souled Karna, and the heroic Yuyudhana, and Dhrishtadyumna, and by<br>the four sons of Pandu, that is, Bhima and Arjuna and twins. This<br>(tremendous) carnage, O king, could not happen without the influence of<br>destiny. Without doubt, by Kshatriyas in particular, should foes be slain<br>and death encountered in battle. By those foremost of men, endued with<br>science and might of arms, the Earth has been exterminated with her<br>steeds and cars and elephants. Thy son was not the cause of that carnage<br>of high-souled kings. Thou wert not the cause, nor thy servants, nor<br>Karna, nor Suvala's son. The destruction of those foremost ones of Kuru's<br>race and of kings by thousands, know, was brought about by destiny. Who<br>can say anything else in this? Thou art regarded as the Guru and the<br>master of the whole world. We, therefore, in thy presence, absolve thy<br>righteous-souled son. Let that king, with all his associates, obtain the<br>regions reserved for heroes. Permitted by foremost of Brahmanas, let him<br>sport blissfully in heaven. Thou also shalt attain to great merit, and<br>unswerving steadiness in virtue. O thou of excellent vows, follow thou<br>fully the duties indicated in the Vedas. It is not necessary for either<br>thee or ourselves to look after the Pandavas. They are capable of ruling<br>the very Heavens, what need then be said of the Earth? O thou of great<br>intelligence, in prosperity as in adversity, the subjects of this<br>kingdom, O foremost one of Kuru's race, will be obedient to the Pandavas<br>who have conduct for their ornament. The son of Pandu makes those<br>valuable gifts which are always to be made to foremost of regenerate<br>persons in sacrifices and in obsequial rites, after the manner of all the<br>great kings of antiquity. The high-minded son of Kunti is mild, and<br>self-restrained, and is always disposed to spend as if he were a second<br>Vaisravana. He has great ministers that attend on him. He is<br>compassionate to even his foes. Indeed, that foremost one of Bharata's<br>race is of pure conduct. Endued with great intelligence, he is perfectly<br>straight-forward in his dealings and rules and protects us like a father<br>protecting his children. From association with him who is the son of<br>Dharma, O royal sage, Bhima and Arjuna and others will never do us the<br>least wrong. They are mild, O thou of Kuru's race, unto them that are<br>mild, and fierce like snakes of virulent poison unto them that are<br>fierce. Possessed of great energy, those high-souled ones are always<br>devoted to the good of the people. Neither Kunti, nor thy<br>(daughter-in-law) Panchali, nor Ulupi, nor the princess of the Sattwata<br>race, will do the least wrong to these people.[28] The affection which<br>thou hast shown towards us and which in Yudhishthira is seen to exist in<br>a still larger measure is incapable of being forgotten by the people of<br>the city and the provinces. Those mighty car-warriors, viz., the son of<br>Kunti, themselves devoted to the duties of the righteousness, will<br>protect and cherish the people even if these happen to be unrighteous. Do<br>thou, therefore, O king, dispelling all anxiety of heart on account of<br>Yudhishthira, set thyself to the accomplishment of all meritorious acts,<br>O foremost of men.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words, fraught with righteousness<br>and merit, of that Brahmana and approving of them, every person in that<br>assembly said, 'Excellent, Excellent' and accepted them as his own.<br>Dhritarashtra also, repeatedly applauding those words, slowly dismissed<br>that assembly of his subjects. Thus honoured by them and looked upon with<br>auspicious glances, the old king, O chief of Bharata's race, joined his<br>hands and honoured them all in return. He then entered his own mansion<br>with Gandhari. Listen now to what he did after that night had passed<br>away."'
