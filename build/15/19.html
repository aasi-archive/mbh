                            "Vaisampayana said. 'Following the advice of Vidura, the king took up his<br>abode on the banks of the Bhagirathi which were sacred and deserved to be<br>peopled with the righteous. There many Brahmanas who had taken up their<br>abode in the woods, as also many Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras, came<br>to see the old monarch. Sitting in their midst, he gladdened them all by<br>his words. Having duly worshipped the Brahmanas with their disciples, he<br>dismissed them all. As evening came, the king, and Gandhari of great<br>fame, both descended into the stream of the Bhagirathi and duly performed<br>their ablutions for purifying themselves. The king and the queen, and<br>Vidura and others, O Bharata, having bathed in the sacred stream,<br>performed the usual rites of religion. After the king had purified<br>himself by a bath, the daughter of Kuntibhoja gently led both him, who<br>was to her as her father-in-law and Gandhari from the water into the dry<br>bank. The Yajakas had made a sacrificial altar there for the king.<br>Devoted to truth, the latter poured libations then on the fire. From the<br>banks of the Bhagirathi the old king, with his followers, observant of<br>vows and with senses restrained, then proceeded to Kurukshetra. Possessed<br>of great intelligence, the king arrived at the retreat of the royal sage<br>Satayupa of great wisdom and had an interview with him. Satayupa, O<br>scorcher of foes, had been the great king of the Kekayas. Having made<br>over the sovereignty of his kingdom to his son he had come into the<br>woods. Satayupa, received king Dhritarashtra with due rites. Accompanied<br>by him, the latter proceeded to the retreat of Vyasa. Arrived at Vyasa's<br>retreat, the delighter of the Kurus received his initiation into the<br>forest mode of life. Returning he took up his abode in the retreat of<br>Satayupa. The high-souled Satayupa, instructed Dhritarashtra in all the<br>rites of the forest mode, at the command of Vyasa. In this way the<br>high-souled Dhritarashtra set himself to the practice of penances, and<br>all his followers also to the same course of conduct. Queen Gandhari<br>also, O monarch, along with Kunti, assumed barks of trees and deer-skins<br>for her robe, and set herself to the observance of the same vows as her<br>lord. Restraining their senses in thought, words, and deeds, as well as<br>by eye, they began to practise severe austerities. Divested of all<br>stupefaction of mind, king Dhritarashtra began to practise vows and<br>penances like a great Rishi, reducing his body to skin and bones, for his<br>flesh was all dried up, bearing matted locks on head, and his person clad<br>in barks and skins. Vidura, conversant with the true interpretations of<br>righteousness, and endued with great intelligence, as also Sanjaya,<br>waited upon the old king with his wife. Both of them with souls under<br>subjection, Vidura and Sanjaya also reduced themselves, and wore barks<br>and rags."'
