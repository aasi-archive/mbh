                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Thus worshipped by the Pandavas, the royal soil of<br>Amvika passed his time happily as before, waited upon and honoured by the<br>Rishis. That perpetuator of Kuru's race used to make those foremost of<br>offerings which should be given to the Brahmanas. The royal son of Kunti<br>always placed those articles under Dhritarashtra's control. Destitute of<br>malice as king Yudhishthira was, he was always affectionate towards his<br>uncle. Addressing his brothers and councillors, the king said, 'King<br>Dhritarashtra should be honoured both by myself and you all. He. indeed,<br>is a well-wisher of mine who is obedient to the commands of<br>Dhritarashtra. He, on the other hand, who behaves otherwise towards him,<br>is my enemy. Such a man should certainly be punished by me. On days of<br>performing the rites ordained for the Pitris, as also in the Sraddhas<br>performed for his sons and all well-wishers, the high-souled Kuru king<br>Dhritarashtra, gave away unto Brahmanas, as each deserved, as profuse<br>measures of wealth as he liked. King Yudhishthira the just, and Bhima,<br>and Arjuna, and the twins, desirous of doing what was agreeable to the<br>old king, used to execute all his orders. They always took care that the<br>old king who was afflicted with the slaughter of his sons and<br>grandsons,&#8212;with, that is, grief caused by the Pandavas<br>themselves,&#8212;might not die of his grief Indeed, the Pandavas bore<br>themselves towards him in such a way that that Kuru hero might not be<br>deprived of that happiness and all those articles of enjoyment which had<br>been his while his sons lived. The five brothers, viz., the sons of<br>Pandu, behaved themselves even thus towards Dhritarashtra, living under<br>his command. Dhritarashtra also, seeing them so humble and obedient to<br>his commands and acting towards him as disciples towards preceptors,<br>adopted the affectionate behaviour of a preceptor towards them in return.<br>Gandhari, by performing the diverse rites of the Sraddha and making gifts<br>unto Brahmanas of diverse objects of enjoyment, became freed from the<br>debt she owed to her slain children. Thus did that foremost of righteous<br>men, viz., king Yudhishthira the just, possessed of great intelligence,<br>along with his brothers, worship king Dhritarashtra.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Possessed of great energy, that perpetuator of<br>Kuru's race, viz., the old king Dhritarashtra, could not notice any<br>ill-will in Yudhishthira Seeing that the high-souled Pandavas were in the<br>observance of a wise and righteous conduct, king Dhritarashtra, the son<br>of Amvika, became gratified with them. Suvala's daughter, Gandhari,<br>casting off all sorrow for her (slain) children, began to show great<br>affection for the Pandavas as if they were her own children. Endued with<br>great energy, the Kuru king Yudhishthira, never did anything that was<br>disagreeable to the royal son of Vichitraviryya. On the other hand, he<br>always behaved towards him in a highly agreeable way. Whatever acts,<br>grave or light, were directed by king Dhritarashtra, or the helpless<br>Gandhari to be done, were all accomplished with reverence, O monarch, by<br>that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the Pandava king. The old king<br>became highly gratified with such conduct of Yudhishthira. Indeed, he was<br>grieved at the remembrance of his own wicked son. Rising every day at<br>early dawn, he purified himself and went through his recitations, and<br>then blessed the Pandavas by wishing them victory in battle. Making the<br>usual gifts unto the Brahmanas and causing them to utter benedictions,<br>and Pouring libations on the sacred fire, the old king prayed for long<br>life to the Pandavas. Indeed, the king had never derived that great<br>happiness from his own sons which he always derived from the sons of<br>Pandu. King Yudhishthira at that time became as agreeable to the<br>Brahmanas as to the Kshatriyas, and the diverse bands of Vaisyas and<br>Sudras of his realm. Whatever wrongs were done to him by the sons of<br>Dhritarashtra, king Yudhishthira, forgot them all, and reverenced his<br>uncle. If any man did anything that was not agreeable to the son of<br>Amvika, he became thereby an object of hatred to the intelligent son of<br>Kunti. Indeed, through fear of Yudhishthira, nobody could talk of the<br>evil deeds of either Duryodhana or Dhritarashtra. Both Gandhari and<br>Vidura also wore well pleased with the capacity the king Ajatasatru<br>showed for bearing wrongs. They were, however, not so pleased, O slayer<br>of foes, with Bhima. Dharma's son, Yudhishthira, was truly obedient to<br>his uncle. Bhima, however, at the sight of Dhritarashtra, became very<br>cheerless. That slayer of foes, seeing Dharma's son reverencing the old<br>king, reverenced him outwardly with a very unwilling heart."'
