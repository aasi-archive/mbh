                            .<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and<br>brothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men<br>risen from sleep. Kunti also shall behold Karna, and she of Yadu's race<br>shall behold her son Abhimanyu. Draupadi shall behold her five sons, her<br>sires, and her brothers also. Even before ye had asked me, this was the<br>thought in my mind. I entertained this purpose when I was urged to that<br>effect by the king, by thee, O Gandhari, and by Kunti. Thou shouldst not<br>grieve for those foremost of men. They met with death in consequence of<br>their devotion to the established practices of Kshatriyas. O faultless<br>one, the work of the gods could not but be accomplished. It was for<br>accomplishing that object that those heroes came down on Earth. They were<br>all portions of the deities. Gandharvas and Apsaras, and Pisachas and<br>Guhyakas and Rakshasas, many persons of great sanctity, many individuals<br>crowned with success (of penances), celestial Rishis, deities and Danavas<br>and heavenly Rishis of spotless character, met with death on the<br>battle-field of Kurukshetra.[49] It is heard that he that was the<br>intelligent king of the Gandharvas, and named Dhritarashtra, took birth<br>in the world of men as thy lord Dhritarashtra. Know that Pandu of<br>unfading glory and distinguished above all others, sprung from the<br>Maruts. Kshattri and Yudhishthira are both portions of the deity of<br>Righteousness. Know that Duryodhana was Kali, and Sakuni was Dwapara. O<br>thou of good features, know that Dussasana and others were all Rakshasas.<br>Bhimasena of great might, that chastiser of foes, is from the Maruts.<br>Know that this Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, is the ancient Rishi Nara.<br>Hrishikesa is Narayana, and the twins are the Aswins. The foremost of<br>heat-giving ones, viz., Surya, having divided his body in twain,<br>continued with one portion to give heat to the worlds and with another to<br>live (on Earth.) as Karna. He that took his birth as the son of Arjuna,<br>that gladdener of all, that heir to the possessions of the Pandavas, who<br>was slain by six great car-warriors (fighting together), was Soma. He was<br>born of Subhadra. Through Yoga-puissance he had divided himself in twain.<br>Dhrishtadyumna who sprung with Draupadi from the sacrificial fire, was an<br>auspicious portion of the deity of fire. Sikhandin was a Rakshasa. Know<br>that Drona was a portion of Vrihaspati, and that Drona's son is born of a<br>portion of Rudra. Know that Ganga's son Bhishma was one of the Vasus that<br>became born as a human being. Thus, O thou of great wisdom, the deities<br>had taken birth as human beings, and after having accomplished their<br>purposes have gone back to Heaven. That sorrow which is in the hearts of<br>you all, relating to the return of these to the other world, I shall<br>today dispel. Do you all go towards the Bhagirathi.&#8212;You will then behold<br>all those that have been slain on the field of battle.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'All the persons there present, having heard the<br>words of Vyasa, raised a loud leonine shout and then proceeded towards<br>the Bhagirathi. Dhritarashtra with all his ministers and the Pandavas, as<br>also with all those foremost of Rishis and Gandharvas that had come<br>there, set out as directed. Arrived at the banks of Ganga, that sea of<br>men took up their abode as pleased them. The king possessed of great<br>intelligence, with the Pandavas, took up his abode in a desirable spot,<br>along with the ladies and the aged ones of his household. They passed<br>that day as if it were a whole year, waiting for the advent of the night<br>when they would behold the deceased princes. The Sun then reached the<br>sacred mountain in the west and all those persons, having bathed in the<br>sacred stream, finished their evening rites."'
