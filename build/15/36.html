                            "Janamejaya said, 'Having seen his sons and grandsons with all their<br>friends and followers, what, indeed, did that ruler of men, viz.,<br>Dhritarashtra, and king Yudhishthira also, do?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Beholding that exceedingly wonderful sight, viz.,<br>the re-appearance of his children, the royal sage, Dhritarashtra, became<br>divested of his grief and returned (from the banks of the Bhagirathi) to<br>his retreat. The common people and all the great Rishis, dismissed by<br>Dhritarashtra, returned to the places they respectively wished. The<br>high-souled Pandavas, accompanied by their wives, and with a small<br>retinue, went to the retreat of the high-souled monarch. Then Satyavati's<br>son, who was honoured by regenerate Rishis and all other persons, arrived<br>at the retreat, addressed Dhritarashtra, saying,&#8212;'O mighty-armed<br>Dhritarashtra. O son of Kuru's race, listen to what I say. Thou hast<br>heard diverse discourses from Rishis of great knowledge and sacred deeds,<br>of wealth of penances and excellence of blood, of conversance with the<br>Vedas and their branches, of piety and years, and of great eloquence. Do<br>not set thy mind again on sorrow. He that is possessed of wisdom is never<br>agitated at ill luck. Thou hast also heard the mysteries of the deities<br>from Narada of celestial form. Thy children have all attained, through<br>observance of Kshatriya practices, to that auspicious goal which is<br>sanctified by weapons. Thou hast seen how they move about at will in<br>great happiness. This Yudhishthira of great intelligence is awaiting thy<br>permission, with all his brothers and wives and kinsmen. Do thou dismiss<br>him. Let him go back to his kingdom and rule it. They have passed more<br>than a month in thus residing in the woods. The station of sovereignty<br>should always be well guarded. O king, O thou of Kuru's race, [thy]<br>kingdom has many foes.' Thus addressed by Vyasa of incomparable energy,<br>the Kuru king, well-versed in words, summoned Yudhishthira and said unto<br>him,&#8212;'O Ajatasatru, blessings on thee! Do thou listen to me, with all<br>thy brothers. Through thy grace, O king, grief no longer stands in my<br>way. I am living as happily, O son, with thee here as if I were in the<br>city called after the elephant. With thee as my protector, O learned one,<br>I am enjoying all agreeable objects. I have obtained from thee all those<br>services which a son renders to his sire. I am highly gratified with<br>thee. I have not the least dissatisfaction with thee, O mighty-armed one.<br>Go now, O son, without tarrying here any longer. Meeting with thee, my<br>penances are being slackened. This my body, endued with penances, I have<br>been able to sustain only in consequence of my meeting with thee.[59]<br>These two mothers of thine, subsisting now upon fallen leaves of trees,<br>and observing vows similar to mine, will not live long. Duryodhana and<br>others, who have become denizens of the other world, have been seen by<br>us, through the puissance of Vyasa's penances and through (the merit of)<br>this my meeting with thee. O sinless one, the purpose of my life has been<br>attained. I now wish to set myself to the practice of the austerest of<br>penances. It behoveth thee to grant me permission. On thee now the<br>obsequial cake, the fame and achievements, and the race of our ancestors,<br>rest. O mighty-armed one, do thou then depart either tomorrow or this<br>very day. Do not tarry, O son. O chief of Bharata's race, thou hast<br>repeatedly heard what the duties are of kings. I do not see what more I<br>can say unto thee. I have no longer any need with thee, O thou of great<br>puissance.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Unto the (old) monarch who said so, king<br>Yudhishthira replied,&#8212;'O thou that art conversant with every rule of<br>righteousness, it behoveth thee, not to cast me off in this way. I am<br>guilty of no fault. Let all my brothers and followers depart as they<br>like. With steadfast vows I shall wait upon thee and upon these two<br>mothers of mine.' Unto him Gandhari then said,&#8212;'O son, let it not be so.<br>Listen, the race of Kuru is now dependant on thee. The obsequial cake<br>also of my father-in-law depends on thee. Depart then, O son. We have<br>been sufficiently honoured and served by thee. Thou shouldst do what the<br>king says. Indeed, O son, thou shouldst obey the behests of thy sire.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;'Thus addressed by Gandhari, King Yudhishthira,<br>rubbing his eyes which were bathed in tears of affection, said these<br>words of lament. 'The king casts me off, as also Gandhari of great fame.<br>My heart, however, is bound to thee. How shall I, filled as I am with<br>grief, leave thee? I do not, however, at the same time, venture to<br>obstruct thy penances, O righteous lady. There is nothing higher than<br>penances. It is by penances that one attains to the Supreme. O queen, my<br>heart no longer turns as of old towards kingdom. My mind is wholly set<br>upon penances now. The whole Earth is empty now. O auspicious lady, she<br>does not please me any longer. Our kinsmen have been reduced in number.<br>Our strength is no longer what it was before. The Panchalas have been<br>wholly exterminated. They exist in name only. O auspicious lady, I do not<br>behold any one that may assist as their re-establishment and growth. All<br>of them have been consumed to ashes by Drona on the field of battle.<br>Those that remained were slain by Drona's son at night. The Chedis and<br>the Matsyas, who were our friends, no longer exist. Only the tribes of<br>the Vrishnis are all that remain, Vasudeva having upheld them. Beholding<br>only the Vrishnis I wish to live. My desire of life, however, is due to<br>my wish of acquiring merit and not wealth or enjoyment. Do thou cast<br>auspicious looks upon us all. To obtain thy sight will be difficult for<br>us. The king will commence to practise the most austere and unbearable of<br>penances.' Hearing these words, that lord of battle, the mighty-armed<br>Sahadeva, with eyes bathed in tears, addressed Yudhishthira, saying,&#8212;'O<br>chief of Bharata's race, I dare not leave my mother. Do thou return to<br>the capital soon. I shall practise penances, O puissant one. Even here I<br>shall emaciate my body by penances, engaged in serving the feet of the<br>king and of these my mothers.' Unto that mighty-armed hero, Kunti, after<br>an embrace, said&#8212;'Depart, O son. Do not say so. Do my bidding. Do all of<br>you go hence. Let peace be yours. Ye sons, let happiness be yours. By<br>your stay here, our penances will be obstructed. Bound by the ties of my<br>affection for thee, I shall fall off from my high penances. Therefore, O<br>son, leave us. Short is the period that we have of life, O thou of great<br>puissance.' By these and diverse other speeches of Kunti, the minds of<br>Sahadeva and king Yudhishthira were composed. Those foremost ones of<br>Kuru's race, having received the permission of their mother as also of<br>the (old) monarch, saluted the latter and began to take his leave.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Gladdened by auspicious blessings, we shall return<br>to the capital. Indeed, O king, having received thy permission, we shall<br>leave this retreat, freed from every sin.' Thus addressed by the<br>high-souled king Yudhishthira the just, that royal sage, viz.,<br>Dhritarashtra, blessed Yudhishthira and gave him permission. The king<br>comforted Bhima, that foremost of all persons endued with great strength.<br>Endued with great energy and great intelligence, Bhima showed his<br>submissiveness to the king. Embracing Arjuna and clasping those foremost<br>of men, viz., the twins also, and blessing them repeatedly, the Kuru king<br>gave them permission to depart. They worshipped the feet of Gandhari and<br>received her blessings also. Their mother Kunti then smelt their heads,<br>and dismissed them. They then circumambulated the king like calves, when<br>prevented from sucking their dams. Indeed, they repeatedly walked round<br>him, looking steadfastly at him.[60] Then all the ladies of the Kaurava<br>household, headed by Draupadi, worshipped their father-in-law according<br>to the rites laid down in the scriptures, and took his leave. Gandhari<br>and Kunti embraced each of them, and blessing them bade them go. Their<br>mothers-in-law instructed them as to how they should conduct themselves.<br>Obtaining leave, they then departed, with their husbands. Then loud<br>sounds were heard, uttered by the charioteers that said,&#8212;'Yoke,<br>yoke,'&#8212;as also of camels that grunted aloud and of steeds that neighed<br>briskly. King Yudhishthira, with his wives and troops and all his<br>kinsmen, set out for Hastinapura."'
