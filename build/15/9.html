                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Santanu duly ruled this Earth. Similarly,<br>Vichitraviryya also, protected by Bhishma, ruled you. Without doubt, all<br>this is known to you. It is also known to you how Pandu, my brother, was<br>dear to me as also to you. He also ruled you duly. Ye sinless ones, I<br>have also served you. Whether those services have come up to the mark or<br>fallen short of it, it behoveth you to forgive me, for I have attended to<br>my duties without heedlessness. Duryodhana also enjoyed this kingdom<br>without a thorn in his side. Foolish as he was and endued with wicked<br>understanding, he did not, however, do any wrong to you. Through the<br>fault, however, of that prince of wicked understanding, and through his<br>pride, as also through my own impolicy, a great carnage has taken place<br>of persons of the royal order. Whether I have, in that matter, acted<br>rightly or wrongly, I pray you with joined hands to dispel all<br>remembrance of it from your hearts.&#8212;This one is old; this one has lost<br>all his children; this one is afflicted with grief; this one was our<br>king;&#8212;this one is a descendant of former kings;&#8212;considerations like<br>these should induce you to forgive me. This Gandhari also is cheerless<br>and old. She too has lost her children and is helpless. Afflicted with<br>grief for the loss of her sops, she solicits you with me. Knowing that<br>both of us are old and afflicted and destitute of children, grant us the<br>permission we seek. Blessed be you, we seek your protection. This Kuru<br>king, Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, should be looked after by you all,<br>in prosperity as well as in adversity. He will never fall into distress,<br>he that has for his counsellors four such brothers of abundant prowess.<br>All of them are conversant with both righteousness and wealth, and<br>resemble the very guardians of the world. Like the illustrious Brahman<br>himself, the Lord of the universe of creatures, this Yudhishthira of<br>mighty energy will rule you. That which should certainly be said is now<br>said by me. I make over to you it this Yudhishthira here as a deposit. I<br>make you also a deposit in the hands of this hero. It behoves you all to<br>forget and forgive whatever injury has been done to you by those sons of<br>mine that are no longer alive, or, indeed, by any one else belonging to<br>me. Ye never harboured any wrath against me on any previous occasion. I<br>join my hands before you who are distinguished for loyalty. Here, I bow<br>to you all. Ye sinless one, I, with Gandhari by my side, solicit your<br>pardon now for anything done to you by those sons of mine, of restless<br>understandings, stained by cupidity, and ever acting as their desires<br>prompted.' Thus addressed by the old monarch, all those citizens and<br>inhabitants of the provinces, filled with tears, said nothing but only<br>looked at one another."'
