                            "Vaisampayana said,&#8212;'Thus addressed by Vidura, king Dhritarashtra became<br>highly pleased, O monarch, with the act of Yudhishthira and Jishnu.<br>Inviting then, after proper examination, thousands of deserving Brahmanas<br>and superior Rishis, for the sake of Bhishma, as also of his sons and<br>friends, and causing a large quantity of food and drink to be prepared,<br>and cars and other vehicles and clothes, and gold and jewels and gems,<br>and slaves both male and female, and goats and sheep, and blankets and<br>costly articles to be collected, and villages and fields, and other kines<br>of wealth to be kept ready, as also elephants and steeds decked with<br>ornaments, and many beautiful maidens who were the best of their sex,<br>that foremost of kings gave them away for the advancement of the dead,<br>naming each of them in due order as the gifts were made. Naming Drona,<br>and Bhishma, and Somadatta, and Valhika, and king Duryodhana, and each<br>one of his other sons, and all his well-wishers with Jayadratha numbering<br>first, those gifts were made in due order. With the approval of<br>Yudhishthira, that Sraddha-sacrifice became characterised by large gifts<br>of wealth and profuse presents of jewels and gems and other kinds of<br>treasure. Tellers and scribes on that occasion, under the orders of<br>Yudhishthira, ceaselessly asked the old king.&#8212;Do thou command, O<br>monarch, what gifts should be made to these. All things are ready<br>here.&#8212;As soon as the king spoke, they gave away what he directed.[30]<br>Unto him that was to receive a hundred, a thousand was given, and unto<br>him that was to receive a thousand was given ten thousand, at the command<br>of the royal son of Kunti.[31] Like the, clouds vivifying the crops with<br>their downpours, that royal cloud gratified the Brahmanas by downpours of<br>wealth. After all those gifts had been distributed, the king, O thou of<br>great intelligence, then deluged the assembled guests of all the four<br>orders with repeated surges of food and drink of diverge tastes. Verily,<br>the Dhritarashtra-ocean, swelling high, with jewels and gems for its<br>waters, rich with the villages and fields and other foremost of gifts<br>constituting its verdant islands, heaps of diverse kinds of precious<br>articles for its rich caves, elephants and steeds for its alligators and<br>whirlpools, the sound of Mridangas for its deep roars, and clothes and<br>wealth and precious stories for its waves, deluged the Earth. It was even<br>in this way, O king, that that monarch made gifts for the advancement in<br>the other world of his sons and grandsons and Pitris as also of himself<br>and Gandhari. At last when he became tired with the task of making gifts<br>in such profusion, that great Gift-sacrifice carne to an end. Even thus<br>did that king of Kuru's race perform his Gift-sacrifice. Actors and mimes<br>continually danced and sang on the occasion and contributed to the<br>merriment of all the guests. Food and drink of diverse tastes were given<br>away in large quantities. Making gifts in this way for ten days, the<br>royal son of Amvika, O chief of Bharata's race, became freed from the<br>debts he owed to his sons and grandsons."'
