                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed by king Yudhishthira, Vidura, that<br>foremost of all intelligent persons, returned to Dhritarashtra and said<br>unto him these words of grave import. 'I at first reported thy message to<br>king Yudhishthira. Reflecting on thy words, Yudhishthira of great<br>splendour applauded them highly. Vibhatsu also, of great energy, places<br>all his mansions, with all the wealth therein, as also his very<br>life-breaths, at thy disposal. Thy son, king Yudhishthira, too, offers<br>thee, O royal sage, his kingdom and life-breath and wealth and all else<br>that belongs to him. Bhima, however, of mighty arms, recollecting all his<br>innumerable sorrows, has with difficulty given his consent, breathing<br>many heavy sighs. That mighty-armed hero, O monarch, was solicited by the<br>righteous king as also by Vibhatsu, and induced to assume relations of<br>cordiality towards thee. King Yudhishthira the just, his prayed thee not<br>to give way to dissatisfaction for the improper conduct which Bhima has<br>displayed at the recollection of former hostilities. This is generally<br>the behaviour of Kshatriyas in battle, O king, and this Vrikodara is<br>devoted to battle and the practices of Kshatriyas. Both myself and<br>Arjuna, O king, repeatedly beg thee for pardoning Vrikodara. Be gracious<br>unto us. Thou art our lord. Whatever wealth we have, thou mayst give away<br>as thou likest, O ruler of Earth. Thou, O Bharata. art the Master of this<br>kingdom and of all lives in it. Let the foremost one of Kuru's race give<br>away, for the obsequial rites of his sons, all those foremost of gifts<br>which should be given to the Brahmanas. Indeed, let him make those gifts<br>unto persons of the regenerate order, taking away from our mansions<br>jewels and gems, and kine, and slaves both mate and female, and goats and<br>sheep. Let gifts be made unto also those that are poor or sightless or in<br>great distress, selecting the objects of his charity as he likes. Let, O<br>Vidura, large pavilions be constructed, rich with food and drink of<br>diverse tastes collected in profusion. Let reservoirs of water be<br>constructed for enabling kine to drink, and let other works of merit be<br>accomplished.&#8212;Even these were the words said unto me by the king as also<br>by Pritha's son Dhananjaya. It behoveth thee to say what should be done<br>next. After Vidura had said these words, O Janamejaya, Dhritarashtra his<br>satisfaction at them and set his heart upon making large presents on the<br>day of full moon in the month of Kartika."'
