                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'O best of kings, thou shouldst also reflect<br>properly on war and peace. Each is of two kinds. The means are various,<br>and the circumstances also, under which war or peace may be made, are<br>various, O Yudhishthira.[18] O thou of Kuru's race, thou shouldst, with<br>coolness, reflect on the two (viz., thy strength and weakness) with<br>regard to thyself. Thou shouldst not suddenly march against a foe that is<br>possessed of contented and healthy soldiers, and that is endued with<br>intelligence. On the other hand, thou shouldst think carefully of the<br>means of vanquishing him.[19] Thou shouldst march against a foe that is<br>not provided with contented and healthy combatants. When everything is<br>favourable, the foe may be beaten. After that, however, the victor should<br>retire (and stay in a strong position). He should next cause the foe to<br>be plunged into various calamities, and sow dissensions among his allies.<br>He should afflict the foe and inspire terror in his heart, and attacking<br>him weaken his forces. The king, conversant with the scriptures that<br>marches against a foe, should think of the three kinds of strength, and,<br>indeed, reflect on his own strength and of his foe.[20] Only that king, O<br>Bharata, who is endued with alacrity, discipline, and strength of<br>counsels, should march against a foe. When his position is otherwise, he<br>should avoid defensive operations.[21] The king should provide himself<br>with power of wealth, power of allies, power of foresters, power of paid<br>soldiery, and power of the mechanical and trading classes, O puissant<br>one.[22] Among all these, power of allies and power of wealth are<br>superior to the rest. The power of classes and that of the standing army<br>are equal. The power of spies is regarded by the king as equal in<br>efficacy to either of the above, on many occasions, when the time comes<br>for applying each. Calamity, O king, as it overtakes rulers should be<br>regarded as of many forms. Listen, O thou of Kuru's race, as to what<br>those diverge forms are. Verily of various kinds are calamities, O son of<br>Pandu. Thou shouldst always count them, distinguishing their forms, O<br>king, and strive to meet them by applying the well-known ways of<br>conciliation and the rest (without concealing them through idleness). The<br>king should, when equipt with a good force, march (out against a foe), O<br>scorcher of enemies. He should attend also to the considerations of time<br>and place, while preparing to march, as also to the forces he has<br>collected and his own merits (in other respects). That king who is<br>attentive to his own growth and advancement should not march unless<br>equipt with cheerful and healthy warriors. When strong, O son of Pandu,<br>he may march in even an unfavourable season. The king should make a river<br>having quivers for its stones, steeds and cars for its current, and<br>standards for the trees that cover its banks, and which is miry with<br>foot-soldiers and elephants. Even such a river should the king apply for<br>the destruction of his foe. Agreeably to the science known to Usanas,<br>arrays called Sakata, Padma, and Vijra, should be formed, O Bharata, for<br>fighting the enemy.[23] Knowing everything about the enemy's strength<br>through spies, and examining his own strength himself the king should<br>commence war either within his own territories or within those of his<br>foe.[24] The king should always gratify his army, and hurl all his<br>strongest warriors (against the enemy). First ascertaining the state of<br>his kingdom, he should apply conciliation or the other well-known means.<br>By all means, O king, should the body be protected. One should do that<br>which is highly beneficial for one both here and hereafter. The king, O<br>monarch, by behaving duly according to these ways, attains to Heaven<br>hereafter, after ruling his subjects righteously in this world. O<br>foremost one of Kuru's race, it is even thus that thou shouldst always<br>seek the good of thy subjects for attaining to both the worlds.[25] Thou<br>hast been instructed in all duties by Bhishma, by Krishna, and by Vidura,<br>I should also, O best of kings, from the affection I bear thee, give thee<br>these instructions. O giver of profuse presents in sacrifices, thou<br>shouldst do all this duly. Thou shalt, by conducting thyself in this way,<br>become dear to thy subjects and attain to felicity in Heaven. That king<br>who adores the deities in a hundred horse-sacrifices, and he who rules<br>his subjects righteously, acquire merit that is equal.'"
