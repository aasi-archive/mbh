                            (Naradagamana Parva)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'After two years had elapsed from the date of the<br>return of the Pandavas (from the retreat of their sire), the celestial<br>Rishi, Narada, O king, came to Yudhishthira. The mighty-armed Kuru king,<br>that foremost of speakers, viz., Yudhishthira, having duly worshipped<br>him, caused him to take a seat. After the Rishi had rested awhile, the<br>king asked him, saying,&#8212;'It is after a long time that I behold thy holy<br>self arrived at my court. Art thou in peace and happiness, O learned<br>Brahmana? What are those countries which thou hast passed through? What<br>shall I do to thee? Do thou tell me. Thou art the foremost of regenerate<br>ones, and thou art our highest refuge.'<br><br>"Narada said, 'I have not seen thee for a long while. Hence it is that I<br>have come to thee from my ascetic retreat. I have seen many sacred<br>waters, and the sacred stream Ganga also, O king.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'People dwelling on the banks of Ganga report that<br>the high-souled Dhritarashtra is practising the austerest of penances.<br>Hast thou seen him there? Is that perpetuator of Kuru's race in peace?<br>Are Gandhari and Pritha, and the Suta's son Sanjaya also, in peace? How,<br>indeed, is it faring with that royal sire of mine? I desire to hear this,<br>O holy one, if thou hast seen the king (and knowest of his condition).'<br><br>"Narada said, 'Listen, O king, with calmness to me as I tell thee what I<br>have heard and seen in that ascetic retreat. After thy return from<br>Kurukshetra, O delighter of the Kurus, thy sire, O king, proceeded<br>towards Gangadwara. That intelligent monarch took with him his (sacred)<br>fire, Gandhari and his daughter-in-law Kunti, as also Sanjaya of the Suta<br>caste, and all the Yajakas. Possessed of wealth of penances, thy sire set<br>himself to the practice of severe austerities. He held pebbles of stone<br>in his mouth and had air alone for his subsistence, and abstained<br>altogether from speech. Engaged in severe penances, he was worshipped by<br>all the ascetics in the woods. In six months the king was reduced only to<br>a skeleton. Gandhari subsisted on water alone, while Kunti took a little<br>every sixth day. The sacred fire, O monarch, (belonging to the Kuru king)<br>was duly worshipped by the sacrificing assistants that were with him,<br>with libations of clarified butter poured on it. They did this whether<br>the king saw the rite or not. The king had no fixed habitation. He became<br>a wanderer through those woods. The two queens, as also Sanjaya, followed<br>him. Sanjaya acted as the guide on even and uneven land. The faultless<br>Pritha, O king, became the eye of Gandhari. One day, that best of kings<br>proceeded to a spot on the margin of Ganga. He then bathed in the sacred<br>stream and finishing his ablutions turned his face towards his retreat.<br>The wind rose high. A fierce forest-conflagration set in. It began to<br>burn that forest all around. When the herds of animals were being burnt<br>all around, as also the snakes that inhabited that region, herds of wild<br>boars began to take themselves to the nearest marshes and waters. When<br>that forest was thus afflicted on all sides and such distress came upon<br>all the living creatures residing there, the king, who had taken no food,<br>was incapable of moving or exerting himself at all. Thy two mothers also,<br>exceedingly emaciated, were unable to move. The king, seeing the<br>conflagration approach him from all sides, addressed the Suta Sanjaya,<br>that foremost of skilful charioteers, saying,&#8212;'Go, O Sanjaya, to such a<br>place where the fire may not burn thee. As regards ourselves, we shall<br>suffer our bodies to be destroyed by this fire and attain to the highest<br>goal.' Unto him, Sanjaya, that foremost of speakers, said,&#8212;'O king, this<br>death, brought on by a fire that is not sacred, will prove calamitous to<br>thee. I do not, however, see any means by which thou canst escape from<br>this conflagration. That which should next be done should be indicated by<br>thee.' Thus addressed by Sanjaya the king once more said,&#8212;'This death<br>cannot be calamitous to us, for we have left our home of our own accord.<br>Water, fire, wind, and abstention from food,[61] (as means of death), are<br>laudable for ascetics. Do thou, therefore, leave us, O Sanjaya, without<br>any delay. Having said these words to Sanjaya, the king concentrated his<br>mind. Facing the east, he sat down, with Gandhari and Kunti. Beholding<br>him in that attitude, Sanjaya walked round him. Endued with intelligence,<br>Sanjaya said,&#8212;'Do thou concentrate thy soul, O puissant one.' The son of<br>a Rishi, and himself possessed of great wisdom, the king acted as he was<br>told. Restraining all the senses, he remained like a post of wood. The<br>highly blessed Gandhari, and thy mother Pritha too, remained in the same<br>attitude. Then thy royal sire was overtaken by the forest-conflagration.<br>Sanjaya, his minister, succeeded in escaping from that conflagration. I<br>saw him on the banks of Ganga in the midst of ascetics. Endued with great<br>energy and great intelligence, he bade them farewell and then started for<br>the mountains of Himavat. Even thus the high-souled Kuru king met with<br>his death, and it was even thus that Gandhari and Kunti, thy two mothers,<br>also met with death, O monarch. In course of my wanderings at will, I saw<br>the bodies of that king and those two queens, O Bharata. Many ascetics<br>came to that retreat, having heard of the end of king Dhritarashtra. They<br>did not at all grieve for that end of theirs. There, O best of men, I<br>heard all the details of how the king and the two queens, O son of Pandu,<br>had been burnt. O king of kings, thou shouldst not grieve for him. The<br>monarch, of his own will, as also Gandhari and thy mother, obtained that<br>contact with fire.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;'Hearing of the exit of Dhritarashtra from this<br>world, the high-souled Pandavas all gave way to great grief. Loud sounds<br>or wailing were heard within the inner apartments of the palace. The<br>citizens also, hearing of the end of the old king, uttered loud<br>lamentations. 'O fie! cried king Yudhishthira in great agony, raising his<br>arms aloft. Thinking of his mother, he wept like a child. All his<br>brothers too, headed by Bhimasena, did the same. Hearing that Pritha had<br>met with such a fate, the ladies of the royal household tittered loud<br>lamentations of grief. All the people grieved upon hearing that the old<br>king, who had become childless, had been burnt to death and that the<br>helpless Gandhari too had shared his fate. When those sounds of wailing<br>ceased for a while, king Yudhishthira the just, stopping his tears by<br>summoning all his patience, said these words."'
