                            "Vaisampayana said, 'When night came, all those persons, having finished<br>their evening rites, approached Vyasa. Dhritarashtra of righteous soul,<br>with purified body and with mind solely directed towards it, sat there<br>with the Pandavas and the Rishis in his company. The ladies of the royal<br>household sat with Gandhari in a secluded spot. All the citizens and the<br>inhabitants of the provinces ranged themselves according to their years.<br>Then the great ascetic, Vyasa, of mighty energy, bathing in the sacred<br>waters of the Bhagirathi, summoned all the deceased warriors, viz., those<br>that had fought on the side of the Pandavas, those that had fought for<br>the Kauravas, including highly blessed kings belonging to diverse realms.<br>At this, O Janamejaya, a deafening uproar was heard to arise from within<br>the waters, resembling that which had formerly been heard of the forces<br>of the Kurus and the Pandavas. Then those kings, headed by Bhishma and<br>Drona, with all their troops, arose by thousands from the waters of the<br>Bhagirathi. There were Virata and Drupada, with their sons and forces.<br>There were the sons of Draupadi and the son of Subhadra, and the Rakshasa<br>Ghatotkacha. There were Karna and Duryodhana, and the mighty car-warrior<br>Sakuni, and the other children, endued with great strength, of<br>Dhritarashtra, headed by Dussasana. There were the son of Jarasandha, and<br>Bhagadatta, and Jalasandha of great energy, and Bhurisravas, and Sala,<br>and Salya, and Vrishasena with his younger brother. There were prince<br>Lakshmana (the son of Duryodhana), and the son of Dhrishtadyumna, and all<br>the children of Sikhandin, and Dhrishtaketu, with his younger brother.<br>There were Achala and Vrishaka, and the Rakshasa Alayudha, and Valhika,<br>and Somadatta, and king Chekitana. These and many others, who for their<br>number cannot be conveniently named, appeared on that occasion. All of<br>them rose from the waters of the Bhagirathi, with resplendent bodies.<br>Those kings appeared, each clad in that dress and equipt with that<br>standard and that vehicle which he had while fighting on the field. All<br>of them were now robed in celestial vestments and all had brilliant<br>ear-rings. They were free from all animosity and pride, and divested of<br>wrath and jealousy. Gandharvas sang their praises, and bards waited on<br>them, chanting their deeds. Robed in celestial vestments and wearing<br>celestial garlands, each of them was waited upon by bands of Apsaras. At<br>that time, through the puissance of his penances, the great ascetic, the<br>son of Satyavati, gratified with Dhritarashtra, gave him celestial<br>vision. Endued with celestial knowledge and strength, Gandhari of great<br>fame saw all her children as also all that had been slain in battle. All<br>persons assembled there beheld with steadfast gaze and hearts filled with<br>wonder that amazing and inconceivable phenomenon which made the hair on<br>their bodies stand on its end. It looked like a high carnival of<br>gladdened men and women. That wondrous scene looked like a picture<br>painted on the canvas. Dhritarashtra, beholding all those heroes, with<br>his celestial vision obtained through the grace of that sage, became full<br>of joy, O chief of Bharata's race."'
