                            "Kunti said, 'It is even so, O mighty-armed son of Pandu, as thou sayest.<br>Ye kings, formerly when ye were cheerless, it was even in this way that I<br>excited you all. Yes, seeing that your kingdom was wrested from you by a<br>match at dice, seeing that you all fell from happiness, seeing that you<br>were domineered over by kinsmen, I instilled courage and high thoughts<br>into your minds. Ye foremost of men, I encouraged you in order that they<br>that were the sons of Pandu might not be lost, in order that their fame<br>might not be lost. You are all equal to Indra. Your prowess resembles<br>that of the very gods. In order that you might not live, watching the<br>faces of others, I acted in that way.[34] I instilled courage into thy<br>heart in order that thou who art the foremost of all righteous persons,<br>who art equal to Vasava, might not again go into the woods and live in<br>misery. I instilled courage into your hearts in order that this Bhima who<br>is possessed of the strength of ten thousand elephants and whose prowess<br>and manliness are widely known, might not sink into insignificance and<br>ruin. I instilled courage into your hearts in order that this Vijaya, who<br>was born after Bhimasena, and who is equal unto Vasava himself might not<br>be cheerless. I instilled courage into your hearts in order that Nakula<br>and Sahadeva, who are always devoted to their seniors, might not be<br>weakened and rendered cheerless by hunger. I acted in that way in order<br>that this lady of well-developed proportions and of large expansive eyes<br>might not endure the wrongs inflicted on her in the public hall without<br>being avenged. In the very sight of you all, O Bhima, Dussasana, through<br>folly, dragged her trembling all over like a plantain plant, during the<br>period of her functional illness, and after she had been won at dice, as<br>if she were a slave. All this was known to me. Indeed, the race of Pandu<br>had been subjugated (by foes). The Kurus, viz., my father-in-law and<br>others, were cheerless when she, desirous of a protector, uttered loud<br>lamentations like a she-osprey. When she was dragged by her fair locks by<br>the sinful Dussasana with little intelligence, I was deprived of my<br>senses, O king. Know, that for enhancing your energy, I instilled that<br>courage into your hearts by reciting the words of Vidula, O my sons. I<br>instilled courage into your hearts, O my sons, in order that the race of<br>Pandu, represented by my children, might not be lost. The sons and<br>grandsons of that person who brings a race to infamy never succeed in<br>attaining to the regions of the righteous. Verily, the ancestors of the<br>Kaurava race were in danger of losing those regions of felicity which had<br>become theirs. As regards myself, O my sons, I, before this, enjoyed the<br>great fruits of that sovereignty which my husband had acquired. I made<br>large gifts. I duly drank the Soma juice in sacrifice.[35] It was not for<br>my own sake that I had urged Vasudeva with the stirring words of Vidula.<br>It was for your sake that I had called upon you to follow that advice. O<br>my sons, I do not desire the fruits of that sovereignty which has been<br>won by my children. O thou of great puissance, I wish to attain, by my<br>penances, to those regions of felicity which have been acquired by my<br>husband. By rendering obedient service to my father-in-law and<br>mother-in-law both of whom wish to take up their abode in the woods, and<br>by penances, I desire, O Yudhishthira, to waste my body. Do thou cease to<br>follow me, O foremost one of Kuru's race, along with Bhima and others.<br>Let thy understanding be always devoted to righteousness. Let thy mind be<br>always great.'"
