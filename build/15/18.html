                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing these words of Kunti, the sinless Pandavas,<br>O best of kings, became ashamed. They, therefore, desisted, along with<br>the princess of-Panchala, from following her.[36] Beholding Kunti<br>resolved to go into the woods, the ladies of the Pandava household<br>uttered loud lamentations. The Pandavas then circumambulated the king and<br>saluted him duly. They ceased to follow further, having failed to<br>persuade Pritha to return. Then Amvika's son of great energy, viz.,<br>Dhritarashtra, addressing Gandhari and Vidura and supporting himself on<br>them, said, 'Let the royal mother of Yudhishthira cease to go with us.<br>What Yudhishthira has said is all very true. Abandoning this high<br>prosperity of her sons, abandoning those high fruits that may be hers,<br>why should she go into the inaccessible woods, leaving her children like<br>a person of little intelligence? Living in the enjoyment of sovereignty,<br>she is capable of practising penances and observing the high vow of<br>gifts. Let her, therefore, listen to my words. O Gandhari, I have been<br>much gratified with the services rendered to me by this daughter-in-law<br>of mine. Conversant as thou art with all duties, it behoveth thee to<br>command her return.' Thus addressed by her lord, the daughter of Suvala<br>repeated unto Kunti all those words of the old king and added her own<br>words of grave import. She, however, failed to cause Kunti to desist<br>inasmuch as that chaste lady, devoted to righteousness, had firmly set<br>her heart upon residing in the woods. The Kuru ladies, understanding how<br>firm her resolution was regarding her retirement into the woods, and<br>seeing that those foremost ones of Kuru's race (viz., their own lords),<br>had ceased to follow her, set up a loud wail of lamentation. After all<br>the sons of Pritha and all the ladies had retraced their steps, king<br>Yudhishthira of great wisdom continued his journey to the woods. The<br>Pandavas, exceedingly cheerless and afflicted with grief and sorrow<br>accompanied by their wives, returned to the city, on their cars. At that<br>time the city of Hastinapura, with its entire population of men, both old<br>and young, and women, became cheerless and plunged into sorrow. No<br>festivals of rejoicing were observed. Afflicted with grief, the Pandavas<br>were without any energy. Deserted by Kunti, they were deeply afflicted<br>with grief, like calves destitute of their dams. Dhritarashtra reached<br>that day a place far removed from the city. The puissant monarch arrived<br>at last on the banks of the Bhagirathi and took rest there for the night.<br>Brahmanas conversant with the Vedas duly ignited their sacred fires in<br>that retreat of ascetics. Surrounded by those foremost of Brahmanas,<br>those sacred fires blazed forth in beauty. The sacred fire of the old<br>king was also ignited. Sitting near his own fire, he poured libations on<br>it according to due rites, and then worshipped the thousand-rayed sun as<br>he was on the point of setting. Then Vidura and Sanjaya made a bed for<br>the king by spreading some blades of Kusa grass. Near the bed of that<br>Kuru hero they made another for Gandhari. In close proximity to Gandhari,<br>Yudhishthira's mother Kunti, observant of excellent vows, happily laid<br>herself down. Within hearing distance of those three, slept Vidura and<br>others. The Yajaka Brahmanas and other followers of the king laid<br>themselves down on their respective beds. The foremost of Brahmanas that<br>were there chanted aloud many sacred hymns. The sacrificial fires blazed<br>forth all around. That night, therefore, seemed as delightful to them as<br>a Brahmi night.[37] When the night passed away, they all arose from their<br>beds and went through their morning acts. Pouring libations then on the<br>sacred fire, they continued their journey. Their first day's experience<br>of the forest proved very painful to them on account of the grieving<br>inhabitants of both the city and the provinces of the Kuru kingdom."
