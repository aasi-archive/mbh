                            "Yudhishthira said, 'When such a fate overtook that high-souled monarch<br>who was engaged in austere penances, notwithstanding the fact of his<br>having such kinsmen as ourselves all alive, it seems to me, O regenerate<br>one, that the end of human beings is difficult to guess. Alas, who would<br>have thought that the son of Vichitraviryya would thus be burnt to death.<br>He had a hundred sons each endued with mighty arms and possessed of great<br>prosperity. The king himself had the strength of ten thousand elephants.<br>Alas, even he has been burnt to death in a forest-conflagration! Alas, he<br>who had formerly been fanned with palm leaves by the fair hands of<br>beautiful women was fanned by vultures with their wings after he had been<br>burnt to death in a forest-conflagration! He who was formerly roused from<br>sleep every morning by bands of Sutas and Magadhas had to sleep on the<br>bare ground through the acts of my sinful self. I do not grieve for the<br>famous Gandhari who had been deprived of all her children. Observing the<br>same vows as her husband, she has attained to those very regions which<br>have become his. I grieve, however, for Pritha who, abandoning the<br>blazing prosperity of her sons, became desirous of residing in the woods.<br>Fie on this sovereignty of ours, fie on our prowess, fie on the practices<br>of Kshatriyas! Though alive, we are really dead! O foremost of superior<br>Brahmanas, the course of Time is very subtle and difficult to understand,<br>inasmuch as Kunti, abandoning sovereignty, became desirous of taking up<br>her abode in the forest. How is it that she who was the mother of<br>Yudhishthira, of Bhima, of Vijaya, was burnt to deathlike a helpless<br>creature. Thinking of this I become stupefied. In vain was the deity of<br>fire gratified at Khandava by Arjuna. Ingrate that he is, forgetting that<br>service he has burnt to death the mother of his benefactor! Alas, how<br>could that deity burn the mother of Arjuna. Putting on the guise of a<br>Brahmana, he had formerly come to Arjuna for soliciting a favour. Fie on<br>the deity of fire! Fie on the celebrated success of Partha's shafts! This<br>is another incident, O holy one, that appears to me to be productive of<br>greater misery, for that lord of Earth met with death by union with a<br>fire that was not sacred. How could such a death overtake that royal sage<br>of Kuru's race who, after having ruled the whole Earth, was engaged in<br>the practice of penances. In that great forest there were fires that had<br>been sanctified with mantras. Alas, my father has made his exit from this<br>world, coming in contact with an unsanctified fire! I suppose that<br>Pritha, emaciated and reduced to a form in which all her nerves became<br>visible, must have trembled in fear and cried aloud, saying,&#8212;O son<br>Yudhishthira, and awaited the terrible approach of the conflagration. She<br>must have also said,&#8212;O Bhima, rescue me from this danger&#8212;when she, my<br>mother, was surrounded on all sides by that terrible conflagration. Among<br>all her sons, Sahadeva, was her darling. Alas, that heroic son of<br>Madravati did not rescue her.' Hearing these lamentations of the king,<br>those persons that were present there began to weep, embracing each<br>other. In fact, the five sons of Pandu were so stricken with grief that<br>they resembled living creatures at the time of the dissolution of the<br>universe. The sound of lamentations uttered by those weeping heroes,<br>filling the spacious chambers of the palace, escaped therefrom and<br>penetrated the very welkin."'
