                            "Sauti said, 'Hearing this story of the re-appearance and departure of<br>his forefathers, king Janamejaya of great intelligence became highly<br>pleased. Filled with joy, he once more questioned Vaisampayana on the<br>subject of the reappearance of dead men, saying,&#8212;"How is it possible for<br>persons whose bodies have been destroyed to re-appear in those very<br>forms?" Thus asked, that foremost of regenerate persons, viz., the<br>disciple of Vyasa, that first of speakers, possessed of great energy,<br>thus answered Janamejaya.<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'This is certain, viz., that acts are never destroyed<br>(without their consequences being enjoyed or endured). Bodies, O king,<br>are born of acts; so also are features. The great primal elements are<br>eternal (indestructible) in consequence of the union with them of the<br>Lord of all beings. They exist with what is eternal. Accordingly, they<br>have no destruction when the non-eternal are destroyed. Acts done without<br>exertion are true and foremost, and bear real fruit. The soul, united<br>however with such acts as require exertion for their accomplishment,<br>enjoys pleasure and pain.[50] Though united so (that is, with pleasure<br>and pain), yet it is a certain inference that the soul is never modified<br>by them, like the reflection of creatures in a mirror. It is never<br>destroyed.[51] As long as one's acts are not exhausted (by enjoyment or<br>endurance of their fruits good and bad), so long does one regard the body<br>to be oneself. The man, however, whose acts have been exhausted, without<br>regarding the body to be self, takes the self to be something<br>otherwise.[52] Diverse existent objects (such as the primal elements and<br>the senses, etc.) attaining to a body, become united as one. To men of<br>knowledge who understand the difference (between the body and self),<br>those very objects become eternal.[53] In the Horse-sacrifice, this Sruti<br>is heard in the matter of the slaying of the horse. Those which are the<br>certain possessions of embodied creatures, viz., their life-breaths (and<br>the senses, etc.), exist eternally even when they are borne to the other<br>world. I shall tell thee what is beneficial, if it be agreeable to thee,<br>O king. Thou hast, while employed in thy sacrifices, heard of the paths<br>of the deities. When preparations were made for any sacrifice of thine,<br>the deities became beneficially inclined to thee. When indeed, the<br>deities were thus disposed and came to thy sacrifices, they were lords in<br>the matter of the passage (from this to the next world) of the animals<br>slain.[54] For this reason, the eternal ones (viz., Jivas), by adoring<br>the deities in sacrifices, succeed in attaining to excellent goals. When<br>the five primal elements are eternal, when the soul also is eternal, he<br>called Purusha (viz., the soul invested with case) is equally so. When<br>such is the case, he who beholds a creature as disposed to take diverse<br>forms, is regarded as having an erroneous understanding. He who indulges<br>in too much grief at separation is, I think, a foolish person. He who<br>sees evil in separation should abandon union. By standing aloof, no<br>unions are formed, and sorrow is cast off, for sorrow in the world is<br>born of separation.[55] Only he who understands the distinction between<br>body and self, and not another, becomes freed from the erroneous<br>conviction. He that knows the other (viz., self) attains to the highest<br>understanding and becomes freed from error.[56] As regards creatures.<br>they appear from an invisible state, and once more disappear into<br>invisibleness. I do not know him. He also does not know me. As regards<br>myself, renunciation is not yet mine.[57] He that is not possessed of<br>puissance enjoys or endures the fruits of all his acts in those too dies<br>in which he does them. If the act be a mental one, its consequences are<br>enjoyed or endured mentally; if it be done with the body, its<br>consequences are to be enjoyed or endured in the body.'"[58]
