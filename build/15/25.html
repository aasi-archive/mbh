                            "Vaisampayana said, 'The king, O chief of Bharata's race, with those<br>foremost of men, viz., his brothers, who were all possessed of eyes that<br>resembled lotus-petals, took his seat in the retreat of his eldest sire.<br>There sat around him many highly-blessed ascetics, hailing from diverse<br>regions, from desire of beholding the sons of that lord of Kuru's race.,<br>viz., the Pandavas of wide chests. They said, 'We wish to know who<br>amongst these is Yudhishthira, who are Bhima and Arjuna, who the twins,<br>and who is Draupadi of great fame.' Then the Suta, Sanjaya, in answer to<br>their queries, pointed out to them the Pandavas. naming each, and<br>Draupadi too as also the other ladies of the Kuru household.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'This one that is as fair of complexion as pure gold, that<br>is endued with a body which looks like that of a full-grown lion, that is<br>possessed of a large aquiline nose, and wide and expansive eyes that are,<br>again, of a coppery hue, is the Kuru king. This one, whose tread<br>resembles that of an infuriate elephant, whose complexion is as fair as<br>that of heated gold, whose frame is of large and expansive proportions<br>and whose arms are long and stout, is Vrikodara. Behold him well! The<br>mighty bowman who sits besides him, of darkish complexion and youthful<br>frame, who resembles the leader of an elephantine herd, whose shoulders<br>are as high as those of a lion, who walks like a sporting elephant, and<br>whose eyes are as expansive as the petals of a lotus, is the hero called<br>Arjuna. Those two foremost of men, that are sitting besides Kunti, are<br>the twins, resembling Vishnu and Mahendra. In this whole world of men,<br>they have not their equals in beauty and strength and excellence of<br>conduct. This lady, of eyes as expansive as lotus petals, who seems to<br>have touched the middle age of life, whose complexion resembles that of<br>the blue lotus, and who looks like a goddess of Heaven, is Krishna, the<br>embodied form of the goddess of prosperity.[39] She who sits besides her,<br>possessed of the complexion of pure gold, who looks like the embodied<br>rays of the moon, in the midst of the other ladies, is, ye foremost of<br>regenerate ones, the sister of that unrivalled hero who wields the<br>discus. This other, as fair as pure gold, is the daughter of the<br>snake-chief and wife of Arjuna.[40] This other whose complexion is like<br>that of pure gold or like that of Madhuka flowers, is the princess<br>Chitrangada. This one, that is possessed of the complexion of an<br>assemblage of blue lotuses, is the sister of that monarch, that lord of<br>hosts, who used to always challenge Krishna. She is the foremost wife of<br>Vrikodara. This is the daughter of the king of Magadha who was known by<br>the name of Jarasandha. Possessed of the complexion of an assemblage of<br>Champakas, she is the wife of the youngest son of Madravati. Possessed of<br>a complexion as darkish as that of the blue lotus, she who sits there on<br>the earth, and whose eyes are as expansive as lotus-petals, is the wife<br>of the eldest son of Madravati, This lady whose complexion is as fair as<br>that of heated gold and who sits with her child on her lap, is the<br>daughter of king Virata. She is the wife of that Abhimanyu who, while<br>divested of his car, was slain by Drona and others fighting from their<br>cars.[41] These ladies, the hair on whose heads shows not the parted<br>line, and who are clad in white, are the widows of the slain sons of<br>Dhritarashtra. They are the daughters-in-law of this old king, the wives<br>of his hundred sons, now deprived of both their husbands and children who<br>have been slain by heroic foes. I have now pointed them out in the order<br>of precedence. In consequence of their devotion to Brahmanas, their<br>understandings and hearts are divested of every kind of crookedness.<br>Possessed of pure souls, they have all been pointed out by me,&#8212;these<br>princesses of the Kaurava house-hold,&#8212;in answer to your queries.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus that king of Kuru's race, of very advanced<br>years, having met with those sons of him that was a deity among men.<br>enquired about their welfare after all the ascetics had gone away. The<br>warriors who had accompanied the Pandavas, leaving the retreat, sat<br>themselves down at a little distance, alighting from their cars and the<br>animals they rode. Indeed, after all the crowd, viz., the ladies, the old<br>men, and the children, had been seated, the old king duly addressed them,<br>making the usual enquiries of politeness."'
