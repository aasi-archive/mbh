                            "Vaisampayana said, 'The people who lived in the Kuru kingdom failed to<br>notice any variance in the cordiality that subsisted between king<br>Yudhishthira and the father of Duryodhana. When the Kuru king recollected<br>his wicked son, he then could not but feel unfriendly, in his heart,<br>towards Bhima. Bhimasena also, O king, impelled by a heart that seemed to<br>be wicked, was unable to put up with king Dhritarashtra. Vrikodara<br>secretly did many acts that were disagreeable to the old king. Through<br>deceitful servitors he caused the commands of his uncle to be disobeyed.<br>Recollecting the evil counsels of the old king and some acts of his,<br>Bhima, one day, in the midst of his friends, slapped his armpits, in the<br>hearing of Dhritarashtra and of Gandhari. The wrathful Vrikodara,<br>recollecting his foes Duryodhana and Karna and Dussasana, gave way to a<br>transport of passion, and said these harsh words: 'The sons of the blind<br>king, capable of fighting with diverse kinds of weapons, have all been<br>despatched by me to the other world with these arms of mine that resemble<br>a pair of iron clubs. Verily, these are those two arms of mine, looking<br>like maces of iron, and invincible by foes, coming within whose clasp the<br>sons of Dhritarashtra have all met with destruction. These are those two<br>well-developed and round arms of mine, resembling a pair of elephantine<br>trunks. Coming within their clasp, the foolish sons of Dhritarashtra have<br>all met with destruction. Smeared with sandal-paste and deserving of that<br>adornment are those two arms of mine by which Duryodhana has been<br>despatched to the other world along with all his sons and kinsmen.'<br>Hearing these and many other words, O king, of Vrikodara, that were<br>veritable darts, king Dhritarashtra gave way to cheerlessness and sorrow.<br>Queen Gandhari, however, who was conversant with every duty and possessed<br>of great intelligence, and who knew what Time brings on its course,<br>regarded them as untrue. After five and ten years had passed away, O<br>monarch, king Dhritarashtra afflicted (constantly) by the wordy darts of<br>Bhima, became penetrated with despair and grief. King Yudhishthira the<br>son of Kunti, however, knew it not; nor Arjuna of white steeds, nor<br>Kunti; nor Draupadi possessed of great fame; nor the twin sons of Madri,<br>conversant with every duty and who were always engaged in acting after<br>the wishes of Dhritarashtra. Employed in doing the behests of the king,<br>the twins never said anything that was disagreeable to the old king. Then<br>Dhritarashtra one day honoured his friends by his confidence. Addressing<br>'them with tearful eyes, He said these words.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'How the destruction of the Kurus has happened is<br>well known to you. All that was brought about by my fault though the<br>Kauravas approved of all my counsels. Fool that I was, I installed the<br>wicked minded Duryodhana, that enhancer of the terrors of kinsmen, to<br>rule over the Kurus. Vasudeva had said unto me, 'Let this sinful wretch<br>of wicked understanding be killed along with all his friends and<br>counsellors.' I did not listen to those words of grave import. All<br>wisemen gave me the same beneficial advice. Vidura, and Bhishma, and<br>Drona, and Kripa, said the same thing. The holy and high-souled Vyasa<br>repeatedly said the same, as also Sanjaya and Gandhari. Overwhelmed,<br>however, by filial affection, I could not follow that advice. Bitter<br>repentance is now my lot for my neglect. I also repent for not having<br>bestowed that blazing prosperity, derived from sires and grand sires, on<br>the high-souled Pandavas possessed of every accomplishment. The eldest<br>brother of Gada foresaw the destruction of all the kings; Janarddana,<br>however, regarded that destruction as highly beneficial.[2] So many<br>Anikas of troops, belonging tome, have been destroyed. Alas, my heart is<br>pierced with thousands of darts in consequence of all these results. Of<br>wicked understanding as I am, now after the lapse of five and ten years,<br>I am seeking to expiate my sins. Now at the fourth division of the day or<br>sometimes at the eighth division, with the regularity of a vow, I eat a<br>little food for simply conquering my thirst. Gandhari knows this. All my<br>attendants are under the impression that I eat as usual. Through fear of<br>Yudhishthira alone I concealed my acts, for if the eldest son of Pandu<br>came to know of my vow, he would feel great pain. Clad in deer-skin, I<br>lie down on the Earth, spreading a small quantity of Kusa grass, and pass<br>the time in silent recitations. Gandhari of great fame passes her time in<br>the observance of similar vows. Even thus do we both behave, we that have<br>lost a century of gong none of whom even retreated from battle. I do not,<br>however, grieve for those children of mine. They have all died in the<br>observance of Kshatriya duties.' Having said these words, the old king<br>then addressed Yudhishthira in particular and said, 'Blessed be thou, O<br>son of the princess of Yadu's race. Listen now to what I say. Cherished<br>by thee, O son, I have lived these years very happily. I have (with thy<br>help) made large gifts and performed Sraddhas repeatedly.[3] I have, O<br>son, to the best of my power, achieved merit largely. This Gandhari,<br>though destitute of sons, has lived with great fortitude, looking all the<br>while at me. They whom inflicted great wrongs on Draupadi and robbed thee<br>of thy affluence,&#8212;those cruel wights&#8212;have all left the world, slain in<br>battle agreeably to the practice of their order.<br><br>I have nothing to do for them, O delighter of the Kurus. Stain with their<br>faces towards battle, they have attained to those regions which are for<br>wielders of weapons.[4] I should now accomplish what is beneficial and<br>meritorious for me as also for Gandhari. It behoveth thee, O great king,<br>to grant me permission. Thou art the foremost of all righteous persons.<br>Thou art always devoted to righteousness. The king is the preceptor of<br>all creatures. It is for this that I say so. With thy permission, O hero,<br>I shall retire into the woods, clad in rags and barks. O king, alone with<br>this Gandhari, I shall live in the woods, always blessing thee. It is<br>meet, O son, for the members of our race, to make over sovereignty, when<br>old age comes, to children and lead the forest mode of life. Subsisting<br>there on air alone, or abstaining from all food, I shall, with this wife<br>of mine, O hero, practise severe austerities. Thou shalt be a sharer of<br>these penances, O son, for thou art the king. Kings are sharers of both<br>auspicious and inauspicious acts done in their kingdom.'[5]<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'When thou, O king, art thus subject to grief,<br>sovereignty does not please me at all. Fie on me that am of wicked<br>understanding, devoted to the pleasures of rule, and utterly heedless of<br>my true concerns. Alas, I, with all my brothers, was ignorant of thyself<br>having so long been afflicted with grief, emaciated with fasts,<br>abstaining from food, and lying on the bare ground. Alas, foolish that I<br>am, I have been deceived by thee that hast deep intelligence, inasmuch<br>as, having inspired me with confidence at first thou hast latterly<br>undergone such grief. What need have I of kingdom or of articles of<br>enjoyment, what need of sacrifices or of happiness, when thou, O king,<br>hast undergone go much affliction? I regard my kingdom as a disease, and<br>myself also as afflicted. Plunged though I am in sorrow, what, however,<br>is the use of these words that I am addressing thee? Thou art our father,<br>thou art our mother; thou art our foremost of superiors. Deprived of thy<br>presence, how shall we live? O best of king, let Yuyutsu, the son of thy<br>loins, be made king, or, indeed, anybody else whom thou mayst wish. I<br>shall go into the woods. Do thou rule the kingdom. It behoveth thee not<br>to burn me that am already burned by infamy. I am not the king. Thou art<br>the king. I am dependent on thy will. How can I dare grant permission to<br>thee that art my preceptor? O sinless one, I harbour no resentment in my<br>heart on account of the wrongs done to us by Suyodhana. It was ordained<br>that it should be so. Both ourselves and others were stupefied (by fate).<br>We are thy children as Duryodhana and others were. My conviction is that<br>Gandhari is as much my mother as Kunti. If thou, O king of kings, goest<br>to the woods leaving me, I shall the, follow thee. I swear by my soul.<br>This Earth, with her belt of seas, go full of wealth, will not be a<br>source of joy to me when I am deprived of thy presence. All this belongs<br>to thee. I gratify thee, bending my head. We are all dependent on thee, O<br>king of kings. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled. I think, O lord<br>of Earth, that all this that has come upon thee is due to destiny. By<br>good luck, I had thought, that waiting upon thee and executing thy<br>commands obediently, I would rescue thee from the fever of thy heart.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'O delighter of the Kurus, my mind is fixed, O son,<br>on penances. O puissant one, it is meet for our race that I should retire<br>into the woods. I have lived long under thy protection, O son, I have for<br>many years been served by thee with reverence. I am now old. It behoveth<br>thee, O king, to grant me permission (to take up my abode in the woods).'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said these words unto king Yudhishthira,<br>the just, king Dhritarashtra, the son of Amvika, trembling the while and<br>with hands joined together, further said unto the high-souled Sanjaya and<br>the great car-warrior Kripa, these words, 'I wish to solicit the king<br>through you. My mind has become cheerless, my mouth has become dry,<br>through the weakness of age and the exertion of speaking.' Having said<br>so, that perpetuator of Kuru's race, viz., the, righteous-souled old<br>king, blessed with prosperity, leaned on Gandhari and suddenly looked<br>like one deprived of life. Beholding him thus seated like one deprived of<br>consciousness, that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the royal son of<br>Kunti, became penetrated by a poignant grief.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Alas, he whose strength was equal to that of a<br>hundred thousand elephants, alas, that king sitteth today, leaning on a<br>woman. Alas! he by whom the iron image of Bhima on a former occasion wag<br>reduced to fragments, leaneth today on a weak woman. Fie on me that am<br>exceedingly unrighteous! Fie on my understanding! Fie on my knowledge of<br>the scripture! Fie on me for whom this lord of Earth lieth today in a<br>manner that is not becoming of him! I also shall fast even as my<br>preceptor. Verily, I shall fast if this king and Gandhari of great fame<br>abstain from food.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The Pandava king, conversant with every duty,<br>using his own hand, then softly rubbed with cold water the breast and the<br>face of the old monarch. At the touch of the king's hand which was<br>auspicious and fragrant, and on which were jewels and medicinal herbs,<br>Dhritarashtra regained his senses.[6]<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Do thou again touch me, O son of Pandu, with thy<br>hand, and do thou embrace me. O thou of eyes like lotus petals, I am<br>restored to my senses through the auspicious touch of thy hand. O ruler<br>of men, I desire to smell thy head. The clasp of thy arms is highly<br>gratifying to me. This is the eighth division of the day and, therefore,<br>the hour of taking my food. For not having taken my food, O child of<br>Kuru's race, I am so weak as to be unable to move. In addressing my<br>solicitations to thee, great hag been my exertion. Rendered cheerless by<br>it, O son, I had fainted. O perpetuator of Kuru's race, I think that<br>receiving the touch of thy hand, which resembles nectar in its vivifying<br>effects I have been restored to my senses.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed, O Bharata, by the eldest brother of<br>his father, the son of Kunti, from affection, gently touched every part<br>of his body. Regaining his life-breaths, king Dhritarashtra embraced the<br>son of Pandu with his arms and smelled his head. Vidura and others wept<br>aloud in great grief. In consequence, however, of the poignancy of their<br>sorrow, they said nothing to either the old king or the son of Pandu.<br>Gandhari, conversant with every duty, bore her sorrow with fortitude, and<br>loaded as her heart was, O king, said nothing. The other ladies, Kunti<br>among them, became greatly afflicted. They wept, shedding copious tears,<br>and sat surrounding the old king. Then 'Dhritarashtra, once more<br>addressing Yudhishthira, said these words, Do thou, O king, grant me<br>permission to practise penances. By speaking repeatedly, O son, my mind<br>becomes weakened. It behoveth thee not, O son, to afflict me after this.'<br>When that foremost one of Kuru's race was saying go unto Yudhishthira, a<br>loud sound of wailing arose from all the warriors there present.<br>Beholding his royal father of great splendour, emaciated and pale,<br>reduced to a state unbecoming of him, worn out with fasts, and looking<br>like a skeleton covered with skin, Dharma's son Yudhishthira shed tears<br>of grief and once more said these words. 'O foremost of men, I do not<br>desire life and the Earth. O scorcher of foes, I shall employ myself in<br>doing what is agreeable to thee. If I deserve thy favour, if I am dear to<br>thee, do thou eat something. I shall then know what to do.' Endued with<br>great energy, Dhritarashtra then said to Yudhishthira,&#8212;'I wish, O son,<br>to take some food, with thy permission.' When Dhritarashtra said these<br>words to Yudhishthira, Satyavati's son Vyasa came there and said as<br>follows.`
