                            (Putradarsana Parva)<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'Tell me. O learned Brahmana, what that wonderful feat<br>was which the great Rishi Vyasa of high energy accomplished after his<br>promise to the old king, made when Dhritarashtra, that lord of Earth,<br>that foremost one of Kuru's race, had taken up his abode in the forest,<br>with his wife and with his daughter-in-law Kunti; and after, indeed,<br>Vidura had left his own body and entered into Yudhishthira, and at the<br>time when all the sons of Pandu were staying in the ascetic retreat. For<br>how many days did the Kuru king Yudhishthira of unfading glory stay, with<br>his men, in the woods? On what food, O puissant one, did the high-souled<br>Pandavas support themselves, with their men, and wives, while they lived<br>in the woods? O sinless one, do thou tell me this.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'With the permission of the Kuru king, the Pandavas,<br>O monarch, with their troops and the ladies of their household, supported<br>themselves on diverse kinds of food and drink and passed about a month in<br>great happiness in that forest. Towards the close of that period, O<br>sinless one, Vyasa came there. While all those princes sat around Vyasa,<br>engaged in conversation on diverse subjects, other Rishis came to that<br>spot. They were Narada, and Parvata and Devala of austere penances, and<br>Viswavasu and Tumvuru, and Chitrasena., O Bharata. Endued with severe<br>penances, the Kuru king Yudhishthira, with the permission of<br>Dhritarashtra, worshipped them according to due rites. Having obtained<br>that worship from Yudhishthira, all of them sat down on sacred seats<br>(made of Kusa grass), as also on excellent seats made of peacock<br>feathers. After they had all taken their seats, the Kuru king of high<br>intelligence took his seat there, surrounded by the sons of Pandu.<br>Gandhari and Kunti and Draupadi, and she of the Sattwata race, and other<br>ladies of the royal household also sat down. The conversation that then<br>arose was excellent and had reference to topics connected with piety, and<br>the Rishis of old, and the deities and the Asuras. At the close of that<br>conversation Vyasa of great energy, that foremost of eloquent men, that<br>first of all persons conversant with the Vedas, highly gratified,<br>addressed the blind monarch and once more said,&#8212;'Burning as thou art<br>with grief on account of thy children, I know, O king of kings, what<br>object is cherished by thee in thy heart. The sorrow that always exists<br>in the heart of Gandhari, that which exists in the heart of Kunti, and<br>that also which is cherished by Draupadi in her heart, and that burning<br>grief, on account of the death of her son, which Krishna's sister<br>Subhadra also cherishes, are all known to me. Hearing of this meeting, O<br>king, of thine with all these princes and princesses of thy house, I have<br>come here, O delighter of the Kauravas, for dispelling thy doubts. Let<br>the deities and Gandharvas, and all these great Rishis, behold today the<br>energy of those penances which I have acquired for these long years.<br>Therefore, O king, tell me what wish of thine I shall grant today. I am<br>puissant enough to grant thee a boon. Behold the fruit of my penances.'<br>Thus addressed by Vyasa of immeasurable understanding, king Dhritarashtra<br>reflected for a moment and then prepared to speak. He said,&#8212;'I am<br>exceedingly fortunate. Lucky am I in obtaining thy favour. My life is<br>crowned with success today,&#8212;since this meeting has happened between me<br>and ye all of great piety. Today I shall attain to that highly happy goal<br>which is reserved for me, since, ye ascetics endued with wealth of<br>penances, ye who are equal to Brahma himself, I have succeeded in<br>obtaining this meeting with you all. There is not the least doubt that<br>this sight that I have obtained of you all has cleansed me of every sin.<br>Ye sinless ones, I have no longer any fear in respect of my end in the<br>next world. Full as I am of love for my children, I always cherish their<br>remembrance. My mind, however, is always tortured by the recollection of<br>the diverse acts of wrong which my wicked son of exceedingly evil<br>understanding perpetrated. Possessed of a sinful understanding, he always<br>persecuted the innocent Pandavas. Alas, the whole Earth has been<br>devastated by him, with her steeds, elephants and men. Many high-souled<br>kings, rulers of diverse realms, came for siding my son and succumbed to<br>death. Alas, leaving their beloved sires and wives and their very<br>life-breaths, all those heroes have become guests of the king of the<br>dead. What end, O regenerate one, has been attained by those men who have<br>been slain, for the sake of their friend, in battle? What end also has<br>been attained by my sons and grandsons who have fallen in the fray? My<br>heart is always pained at the thought of my having brought about the<br>slaughter of the mighty Bhishma, the son of Santanu, and of Drona, that<br>foremost of Brahmanas, through my foolish and sinful son who was an<br>injurer of his friends. Desirous of obtaining the sovereignty of the<br>Earth, he caused the Kuru race, blazing with prosperity, to be<br>annihilated. Reflecting on all this, I burn day and night with grief.<br>Deeply afflicted with pain and grief, I am unable to obtain peace of<br>mind. Indeed, O father, thinking of all this, I have no peace of mind.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these lamentations expressed in diverse<br>ways, of that royal sage, the grief, O Janamejaya, of Gandhari, became<br>fresh. The grief also of Kunti, of the daughter of Drupada, of Subhadra,<br>and of the other members, male and female, and the daughters-in-law, of<br>the Kuru race, became equally green. Queen Gandhari, with bandaged eyes,<br>joining her hands, addressed her father-in-law. Deeply afflicted with<br>grief on account of the slaughter of her sons, she said,&#8212;'O foremost of<br>ascetics, sixteen years have passed over the head of this king grieving<br>for the death of his sons and divested of peace of mind. Afflicted with<br>grief on account of the slaughter of his children, this king<br>Dhritarashtra, always breathes heavily, and never sleeps at night. O<br>great Rishi, through the power of thy penances thou art competent to<br>create new worlds. What need I say then about showing this king his<br>children who are now in the other world? This Krishna, the daughter of<br>Drupada, hath lost all her kinsmen and children. For this, she who is the<br>dearest of my daughters-in-law grieves exceedingly. The sister of<br>Krishna, viz., Subhadra of sweet speech, burning with the loss of her<br>son, grieves as deeply. This lady that is respected by all, that is the<br>wife of Bhurisravas, afflicted with grief on account of the fate that has<br>overtaken her husband, always indulges in heart-rending lamentations. Her<br>father-in-law was the intelligent Valhika of Kuru's race. Alas, Somadatta<br>also was slain, along with his sire, in the great battle![47] Alas, a<br>century of sons, heroes that never retreated from battle, belonging to<br>this son of thine, this king of great intelligence and great prosperity,<br>has been slain in battle. The hundred wives of those sons are all<br>grieving and repeatedly enhancing the grief of both the king and myself.<br>O great ascetic, stricken by that great slaughter, they have gathered<br>round me. Alas, those high-souled heroes, those great car warriors, my<br>fathers-in-law, Somadatta and others,&#8212;alas, what end has been theirs, O<br>puissant one? Through thy grace, O holy one, that will happen in<br>consequence of which this lord of Earth, myself, and this daughter-in-law<br>of thine, viz., Kunti, shall all become freed from our grief. After<br>Gandhari had said so, Kunti, whose face had become wasted through<br>observance of many hard vows, began to think of her secret-born son<br>endued with solar effulgence. The boon giving Rishi Vyasa, capable of<br>both beholding and hearing what happened at a remote distance, saw that<br>the royal mother of Arjuna was afflicted with grief. Unto her Vyasa<br>said,&#8212;'Tell me, O blessed one, what is in thy mind. Tell me what thou<br>wishest to say. At this, Kunti, bending her head unto her father-in-law,<br>and overcome with bashfulness, said these words unto him, relating to the<br>occurrences of the past.'"
