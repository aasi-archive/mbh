                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O lord of Earth, I shall do as thou biddest me. O<br>foremost of kings, I should be further instructed by thee. Bhishma has<br>ascended to Heaven. The slayer of Madhu has departed (for Dwaraka).<br>Vidura and Sanjaya also will accompany thee to the forest. Who else,<br>therefore, than thee will teach me? Those instructions which thou<br>imparted today, desirous of doing good to me, I shall certainly follow, O<br>lord of Earth. Be thou assured of this, O king.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by king Yudhishthira the just,<br>of great intelligence, the royal sage, Dhritarashtra, O chief of the<br>Bharatas, wished to obtain the king's permission (about his retirement to<br>the forest). And he said, 'Cease, O son, great has been my toil.' Having<br>said these words, the old king entered the apartments of Gandhari. Unto<br>that husband of hers who resembled a second Lord of all creatures, while<br>resting on a seat, Gandhari of righteous conduct, conversant with the<br>opportuneness of everything, said these words, the hour being suited to<br>them,&#8212;'Thou hast obtained the permission of that great Rishi, viz.,<br>Vyasa himself. When, however, wilt thou go to the forest, with the<br>permission of Yudhishthira?'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'O Gandhari, I have received the permission of my<br>high-souled sire. With the permission of Yudhishthira (next obtained), I<br>shall soon retire into the woods. I desire, however, to give away some<br>wealth capable of following the status of Preta, in respect of all those<br>sons of mine who were addicted to calamitous dice. Verily, I desire to<br>make those gifts, inviting all the people to my mansion.'[26]<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said so (to Gandhari), Dhritarashtra<br>sent for Yudhishthira. The latter, at his uncle's command, brought all<br>the articles necessary. Many Brahmanas residing in Kuru-jangala, and many<br>Kshatriyas, many Vaisyas, and many Sudras also, came to Dhritarashtra's<br>mansion, with gratified hearts. The old king, coming out of the inner<br>apartments, beheld them all, as also his subjects assembled together.<br>Beholding all those assembled citizens and inhabitants of the provinces,<br>and his well-wishers also thus gathered together, and the large number of<br>Brahmanas arrived from diverge realms, king Dhritarashtra of great<br>intelligence, O monarch, said these words,&#8212;'Ye all and the Kurus have<br>lived together for many long years, well-wishers of each other, and each<br>employed in doing good to the other. What I shall now say in view of the<br>opportunity that has come, should be accomplished by you all even as<br>disciples accomplish the biddings of their preceptors. I have set my<br>heart upon retiring into the woods, along with Gandhari as my companion.<br>Vyasa has approved of this, as also the son of Kunti. Let me have your<br>permission too. Do not hesitate in this. That goodwill, which has always<br>existed between you and us, is not to be seen, I believe, in other realms<br>between the rulers and the ruled. I am worn out with this load of years<br>on my head. I am destitute of children. Ye sinless ones, I am emaciated<br>with fasts, along with Gandhari. The kingdom having passed to<br>Yudhishthira, I have enjoyed great happiness. Ye foremost of men, I think<br>that happiness has been greater than what I could expect from<br>Duryodhana's sovereignty. What other refuge can I have, old as I am and<br>destitute of children, save the woods? Ye highly blessed ones, it behoves<br>you to grant me the permission I seek. Hearing these words of his, all<br>these residents of Kurujangala, uttered loud lamentations, O best of the<br>Bharatas, with voices choked with tears. Desirous of telling those<br>grief-stricken people something more, Dhritarashtra of great energy, once<br>more addressed them and said as follows.'"
