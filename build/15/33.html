                            "Vaisampayana said. 'Then those foremost of men divested of wrath and<br>jealousy, and cleansed of every sin, met with one another, agreeably to<br>those high and auspicious ordinances that have been laid down by<br>regenerate Rishis. All of them were happy of hearts and looked like gods<br>moving in Heaven. Son met with sire or mother, wives with husbands,<br>brother with brother, and friend with friend, O king. The Pandavas, full<br>of joy, met with the mighty bowman Karna as also with the son of<br>Subhadra, and the children of Draupadi. With happy hearts the sons of<br>Pandu approached Karna, O monarch, and became reconciled with him. All<br>those warriors, O chief of Bharata's race, meeting with one another<br>through the grace of the great ascetic, became reconciled with one<br>another. Casting off all unfriendliness, they became established on amity<br>and peace. It was even thus that all those foremost of men, viz., the<br>Kauravas and other kings became united with the Kurus rid other kinsmen<br>of theirs as also with their children. The whole of that night they<br>passed in great happiness. Indeed, the Kshatriya warriors, in consequence<br>of the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There<br>was no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that<br>region, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.<br>Meeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies<br>cast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported<br>with one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,<br>embracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the<br>places they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed<br>that concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large<br>crowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those<br>high-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,<br>with their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to<br>the regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the<br>region of Varuna, and some to the region of Kuvera. Some among those<br>kings proceeded to the region of Surya. Amongst the Rakshasas and<br>Pisachas some proceeded to the country of Uttara-Kurus. Others, moving in<br>delightful attitudes, went in the company of the deities. Even thus did<br>all those high-souled persons disappear with their vehicles and animals<br>and with all their followers. After all of them had gone away, the great<br>sage, who was standing in the waters of the sacred stream viz., Vyasa of<br>great righteousness and energy, that benefactor of the Kurus, then<br>addressed those Kshatriya ladies who had become widows, and said these<br>words, 'Let those amongst these foremost of women that are desirous of<br>attaining to the regions acquired by their husbands cast away all sloth<br>and quickly plunge into the sacred Bhagirathi.&#8212;Hearing these words of<br>his, those foremost ladies, placing faith in them, took the permission of<br>their father-in-law, and then plunged into the waters of the Bhagirathi.<br>Freed from human bodies, those chaste ladies then proceeded, O king, with<br>their husbands to the regions acquired by the latter. Even thus, those<br>ladies of virtuous conduct, devoted to their husbands entering, the<br>waters of the Bhagirathi, became freed from their mortal tenements and<br>attained to the companionship of their husbands in the regions acquired<br>by them. Endued with celestial forms, and adorned with celestial<br>ornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded<br>to those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed<br>of excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,<br>they were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every<br>accomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by<br>right. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a<br>giver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of<br>the wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing<br>of this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became<br>highly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with<br>everything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects<br>both here and hereafter. That man of learning and science, that foremost<br>of righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of<br>others acquires great fame here and an auspicious end hereafter, as also<br>a union with kinsmen and all desirable objects. Such a man has not to<br>undergo painful labour for his sustenance, and meets with all sorts of<br>auspicious objects in life. Even these are the rewards reaped by a person<br>who, endued with devotion to Vedic studies and with penances, recites<br>this narrative in the hearing of others. Those persons who possessed of<br>good conduct, devoted to self-restraint, cleansed of all sins by the<br>gifts they make, endued with sincerity, having tranquil souls, freed from<br>falsehood and the desire of injuring others, adorned with faith, belief<br>in the scriptures, and intelligence, listen to this wonderful parvan,<br>surely attain to the highest goal hereafter."
