                            "Vaisampayana said, 'The Pandavas alighted, at a distance, from their<br>cars and proceeded on foot to the retreat of the king, bending themselves<br>in humility. All the combatants also, and all the denizens of the<br>kingdom, and the spouses of the Kuru chiefs, followed them on foot. The<br>Pandavas then reached the sacred retreat of Dhritarashtra which abounded<br>with herds of deer and which was adorned with plantain plants. Many<br>ascetics of rigid vows, filled with curiosity, came there for beholding<br>the Pandavas who had arrived at the retreat. The king, with tears in his<br>eyes, asked them, saying,&#8212;'Where has my eldest sire, the perpetuator of<br>Kuru's race, gone?' They answered, O monarch, telling him that he had<br>gone to the Yamuna for his ablutions, as also for fetching flowers and<br>waters. Proceeding quickly on foot along the path pointed out by them,<br>the Pandavas beheld all of them from a distance. Desirous of meeting with<br>their sire they walked with a rapid pace. Then Sahadeva ran with speed<br>towards the spot where Pritha was. Touching the feet of his mother, he<br>began to weep aloud. With tears gushing down her cheeks, she saw her<br>darling child. Raising her son up and embracing him with her arms, she<br>informed Gandhari of Sahadeva's arrival. Then seeing the king and<br>Bhimasena and Arjuna, and Nakula, Pritha endeavoured to advance quickly<br>towards them. She was walking in advance of the childless old couple, and<br>was dragging them forward. The Pandavas, beholding her, fell down on the<br>earth. The puissant and high-souled monarch, endued with great<br>intelligence, recognising them by their voices and also by touch,<br>comforted them one after another. Shedding tears, those high-souled<br>princes, with due formalities, approached the old king and Gandhari, as<br>also their own mother. Indeed, regaining their senses, and once more<br>comforted by their mother, the Pandavas took away from the king and their<br>aunt and mother the jars full of water which they had been carrying,<br>forbearing them themselves. The ladies of those lions among men, and all<br>the women of the royal household, as also all the inhabitants of the city<br>and provinces, then beheld the old king. King Yudhishthira presented all<br>those individuals one after another to the old king, repeating their<br>names and races, and then himself worshipped his eldest sire with<br>reverence. Surrounded by them all, the old monarch, with eyes bathed in<br>tears of joy, regarded himself as once more staying in the midst of the<br>city called after the elephant. Saluted with reverence by all his<br>daughters-in-law headed by Krishna, king Dhritarashtra, endued with great<br>intelligence, with Gandhari and Kunti, became filled with joy. He then<br>reached his forest-retreat that was applauded by Siddhas and Charanas,<br>and that then teemed with vast crowds of men all desirous of beholding<br>him, like the firmament teeming with innumerable stars."
