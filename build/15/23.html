                            "Vaisampayana said. 'That foremost one of Bharata's race, then ordered<br>his troops, which were protected by heroes that were headed by Arjuna and<br>that resembled the very guardians of the universe, to march out.<br>Instantly, a loud clamour arose consisting of the words&#8212;Equip,<br>Equip!&#8212;of horse-men, O Bharata, engaged in equipping and their steeds.<br>Some proceeded on carriages and vehicles, some on horses of great speed,<br>and some on cars made of gold endued with the splendour of blazing fires.<br>Some proceeded on mighty elephants, and some on camels, O king. Some<br>proceeded on foot, that belonged to that class of combatants which is<br>armed with tiger-like claws.[38] The citizens and inhabitants of the<br>provinces, desirous of seeing Dhritarashtra, followed the king on diverse<br>kinds of conveyances. The preceptor Kripa also, of Gotama's race, that<br>great leader of forces, taking all the forces with him, proceeded, at the<br>command of the king, towards the old monarch's retreat. The Kuru king<br>Yudhishthira, that perpetuator of Kuru's race, surrounded by a large<br>number of Brahmanas, his praises sung by a large band of Sutas and<br>Magadhas and bards, and with a white umbrella held over his head and<br>encompassed around by a large number of cars, set out on his journey.<br>Vrikodara, the son of the Wind-god, proceeded on an elephant as gigantic<br>as a hill, equipt with strung bow and machines and weapons of attack and<br>defence. The twin sons of Madri proceeded on two fleet steeds, well cased<br>in mail, well protected, and equipt with banners. Arjuna of mighty<br>energy, with senses under control, proceeded on an excellent car endued<br>with solar effulgence and unto which were equipt excellent steeds of<br>white hue. The ladies of the royal household, headed by Draupadi,<br>proceeded in closed litters protected by the superintendents of women.<br>They scattered copious showers of wealth as they proceeded. Teeming with<br>cars and elephants and steeds, and echoing with the blare of trumpets and<br>the music of Vinas, the Pandava host, O monarch, blazed with great<br>beauty. Those chiefs of Kuru's race proceeded slowly, resting by<br>delightful banks of rivers and lakes, O monarch. Yuyutsu of mighty<br>energy, and Dhaumya, the priest at the command of Yudhishthira, were<br>engaged in protecting the city. By slow marches, king Yudhishthira<br>reached Kurukshetra, and then, crossing the Yamuna, that highly sacred<br>river, he beheld from a distance the retreat, O thou of Kuru's race, of<br>the royal sage of great wisdom and of Dhritarashtra. Then all the men<br>became filled with joy and quickly entered the forest, filling it with<br>loud sounds of glee, O chief of Bharata's race."'
