                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Arrived at Hastinapura, that best of Brahmanas, the<br>son of Bharadwaja, continued to live privately in the house of Gautama<br>(Kripa). His mighty son (Aswatthaman) at intervals of Kripa's teaching,<br>used to give the sons of Kunti lessons in the use of arms. But as yet<br>none knew of Aswatthaman's prowess.<br><br>"Drona had thus lived privately for some time in the house of Kripa when<br>one day the heroic princes, all in a company, came out of Hastinapura.<br>And coming out of the city, they began to play with a ball and roam about<br>in gladness of heart. And it so happened that the ball with which they<br>had been playing fell into a well. And thereupon the princes strove their<br>best to recover it from the well. But all the efforts the princes made to<br>recover it proved futile. They then began to eye one another bashfully,<br>and not knowing how to recover it, their anxiety became great. Just at<br>this time they beheld a Brahmana near enough unto them, of darkish hue,<br>decrepit and lean, sanctified by the performance of the Agnihotra and who<br>had finished his daily rites of worship. And beholding that illustrious<br>Brahmana, the princes who had despaired of success surrounded him<br>immediately. Drona (for that Brahmana was no other), seeing the princes<br>unsuccessful, and conscious of his own skill, smiled a little, and<br>addressing them said, 'Shame on your Kshatriya might, and shame also on<br>your skill in arms! You have been born in the race of Bharata! How is it<br>that ye cannot recover the ball (from the bottom of this well)? If ye<br>promise me a dinner today, I will, with these blades of grass, bring up<br>not only the ball ye have lost but this ring also that I now throw down!'<br>Thus saying, Drona that oppressor of foes, taking off his ring, threw it<br>down into the dry well. Then Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, addressing<br>Drona, said, 'O Brahmana (thou askest for a trifle)! Do thou, with<br>Kripa's permission, obtain of us that which would last thee for life!'<br>Thus addressed, Drona with smiles replied unto the Bharata princes,<br>saying, 'This handful of long grass I would invest, by my mantras, with<br>the virtue of weapons. Behold these blades possess virtues that other<br>weapons, have not! I will, with one of these blades, pierce the ball, and<br>then pierce that blade with another, and that another with a third, and<br>thus shall I, by a chain, bring up the ball.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Drona did exactly what he had said. And<br>the princes were all amazed and their eyes expanded with delight. And<br>regarding what they had witnessed to be very extraordinary, they said, O<br>learned Brahmana, do thou bring up the ring also without loss of time.'<br><br>"Then the illustrious Drona, taking a bow with an arrow, pierced the ring<br>with that arrow and brought it up at once. And taking the ring thus<br>brought up from the well still pierced with his arrow, he coolly gave it<br>to the astonished princes. Then the latter, seeing the ring thus<br>recovered, said, 'We bow to thee, O Brahmana! None else owneth such<br>skill. We long to know who thou art and whose son. What also can we do<br>for thee?'<br><br>"Thus addressed, Drona replied unto the princes, saying, 'Do ye repair<br>unto Bhishma and describe to him my likeness and skill. The mighty one<br>will recognize me.' The princes then saying, 'So be it,' repaired unto<br>Bhishma and telling him of the purport of that Brahmana's speech, related<br>everything about his (extraordinary) feat. Hearing everything from the<br>princes, Bhishma at once understood that the Brahmana was none else than<br>Drona, and thinking that he would make the best preceptor for the<br>princes, went in person unto him and welcoming him respectfully, brought<br>him over to the place. Then Bhishma, that foremost of all wielders of<br>arms, adroitly asked him the cause of his arrival at Hastinapura. Asked<br>by him, Drona represented everything as it had happened, saying, 'O sir,<br>in times past I went to the great Rishi Agnivesa for obtaining from him<br>his weapons, desirous also of learning the science of arms. Devoted to<br>the service of my preceptor, I lived with him for many years in the<br>humble guise of a Brahmacharin, with matted locks on my head. At that<br>time, actuated by the same motives, the prince of Panchala, the mighty<br>Yajnasena, also lived in the same asylum. He became my friend, always<br>seeking my welfare. I liked him much. Indeed, we lived together for many,<br>many years. O thou of Kuru's race, from our earliest years we had studied<br>together and, indeed, he was my friend from boyhood, always speaking and<br>doing what was agreeable to me. For gratifying me, O Bhishma, he used to<br>tell me, 'O Drona, I am the favourite child of my illustrious father.<br>When the king installeth me as monarch of the Panchalas, the kingdom<br>shall be thine. O friend, this, indeed, is my solemn promise. My<br>dominion, wealth and happiness, shall all be dependent on thee.' At last<br>the time came for his departure. Having finished his studies, he bent his<br>steps towards his country. I offered him my regards at the time, and,<br>indeed, I remembered his words ever afterwards.<br><br>"Some time after, in obedience to the injunctions of my father and<br>tempted also by the desire of offspring, I married Kripi of short hair,<br>who gifted with great intelligence, had observed many rigid vows, and was<br>ever engaged in the Agnihotra and other sacrifices and rigid austerities.<br>Gautami, in time, gave birth to a son named Aswatthaman of great prowess<br>and equal in splendour unto the Sun himself. Indeed, I was pleased on<br>having obtained Aswatthaman as much as my father had been on obtaining me.<br><br>"And it so happened that one day the child Aswatthaman observing some<br>rich men's sons drink milk, began to cry. At this I was so beside myself<br>that I lost all knowledge of the point of the compass. Instead of asking<br>him who had only a few kine (so that if he gave me one, he would no<br>longer be able to perform his sacrifices and thus sustain a loss of<br>virtue), I was desirous of obtaining a cow from one who had many, and for<br>that I wandered from country to country. But my wanderings proved<br>unsuccessful, for I failed to obtain a milch cow. After I had come back<br>unsuccessful, some of my son's playmates gave him water mixed with<br>powdered rice. Drinking this, the poor boy, was deceived into the belief<br>that he had taken milk, and began to dance in joy, saying, 'O, I have<br>taken milk. I have taken milk!' Beholding him dance with joy amid these<br>playmates smiling at his simplicity, I was exceedingly touched. Hearing<br>also the derisive speeches of busy-bodies who said, 'Fie upon the<br>indigent Drona, who strives not to earn wealth, whose son drinking water<br>mixed with powdered rice mistaketh it for milk and danceth with joy,<br>saying, 'I have taken milk,&#8212;I have taken milk!'&#8212;I was quite beside<br>myself. Reproaching myself much, I at last resolved that even if I should<br>have to live cast off and censured by Brahmanas, I would not yet, from<br>desire of wealth, be anybody's servant, which is ever hateful. Thus<br>resolved, O Bhishma, I went, for former friendship, unto the king of the<br>Somakas, taking with me my dear child and wife. Hearing that he had been<br>installed in the sovereignty (of the Somakas), I regarded myself as<br>blessed beyond compare. Joyfully I went unto that dear friend of mine<br>seated on the throne, remembering my former friendship with him and also<br>his own words to me. And, O illustrious one, approaching Drupada, I said,<br>'O tiger among men, know me for thy friend!'&#8212;Saying this, I approached<br>him confidently as a friend should. But Drupada, laughing in derision<br>cast me off as if I were a vulgar fellow. Addressing me he said, 'Thy<br>intelligence scarcely seemeth to be of a high order inasmuch as<br>approaching me suddenly, thou sayest thou art my friend! Time that<br>impaireth everything, impaireth friendship also. My former friendship<br>with thee was for a particular purpose. One of impure birth can never be<br>a friend of one who is of pure birth. One who is not a car-warrior can<br>never be a friend of one who is such. Friendship can only subsist between<br>persons that are of equal rank, but not between those that are unequally<br>situated. Friendship never subsisteth for ever in my heart. Time<br>impaireth friendships, as also anger destroyeth them. Do thou not stick,<br>therefore, to that worn-off friendship between us. Think not of it any<br>longer. The friendship I had with thee, O best of Brahmanas, was for a<br>special purpose. There cannot be friendship between a poor man and a rich<br>man, between an unlettered hind and a man of letters, between a coward<br>and a hero. Why dost thou, therefore, desire, the revival of our former<br>friendship? O thou of simple understanding, great kings can never have<br>friendship with such indigent and luckless wight as thou? One who is not<br>a king can never have a king for his friend. I do not remember ever<br>having promised thee my kingdom. But, O Brahmana, I can now give thee<br>food and shelter for one night.'&#8212;Thus addressed by him, I left his<br>presence quickly with my wife, vowing to do that which I will certainly<br>do soon enough. Thus insulted by Drupada, O Bhishma, I have been filled<br>with wrath, I have come to the Kurus, desirous of obtaining intelligent<br>and docile pupils. I come to Hastinapura to gratify thy wishes. O, tell<br>me what I am to do.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by the son of Bharadwaja,<br>Bhishma said unto him, 'String thy bow, O Brahmana, and make the Kuru<br>princes accomplished in arms. Worshipped by the Kurus, enjoy with a glad<br>heart to thy fill every comfort in their abode. Thou art the absolute<br>lord, O Brahmana, of what ever wealth the Kurus have and of their<br>sovereignty and kingdom! The Kurus are thine (from this day). Think that<br>as already accomplished which may be in thy heart. Thou art, O Brahmana,<br>obtained by us as the fruit of our great good luck. Indeed, the favour<br>thou hast conferred upon me by thy arrival is great.'
