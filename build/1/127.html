                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Dhritarashtra then said, 'O Vidura, celebrate<br>the funeral ceremonies of that lion among kings viz., Pandu, and of Madri<br>also, in right royal style. For the good of their souls, distribute<br>cattle, cloths, gems and diverse kinds of wealth, every one receiving as<br>much as he asketh for. Make arrangements also for Kunti's performing the<br>last rites of Madri in such a style as pleaseth her. And let Madri's body<br>be so carefully wrapped up that neither the Sun nor Vayu (god of wind)<br>may behold it. Lament not for the sinless Pandu. He was a worthy king and<br>hath left behind him five heroic sons equal unto the celestials<br>themselves.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Vidura, O Bharata, saying, 'So be it,' in<br>consultation with Bhishma, fixed upon a sacred spot for the funeral rites<br>of Pandu. The family priests went out of the city without loss of time,<br>carrying with them the blazing sacred fire fed with clarified butter and<br>rendered fragrant therewith. Then friends, relatives, and adherents,<br>wrapping it up in cloth, decked the body of the monarch with the flowers<br>of the season and sprinkled various excellent perfumes over it. And they<br>also decked the hearse itself with garlands and rich hangings. Then<br>placing the covered body of the king with that of his queen on that<br>excellent bier decked out so brightly, they caused it to be carried on<br>human shoulders. With the white umbrella (of state) held over the hearse<br>with waving yak-tails and sounds of various musical instruments, the<br>whole scene looked bright and grand. Hundreds of people began to<br>distribute gems among the crowd on the occasion of the funeral rites of<br>the king. At length some beautiful robes, and white umbrellas and larger<br>yak-tails, were brought for the great ceremony. The priests clad in white<br>walked in the van of the procession pouring libations of clarified butter<br>on the sacred fire blazing in an ornamental vessel. And Brahmanas, and<br>Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas, and Sudras by thousands followed the deceased<br>king, loudly wailing in these accents, 'O prince, where dost thou go,<br>leaving us behind, and making us forlorn and wretched for ever?' And<br>Bhishma, and Vidura, and the Pandavas, also all wept aloud. At last they<br>came to a romantic wood on the banks of the Ganga. There they laid down<br>the hearse on which the truthful and lion-hearted prince and his spouse<br>lay. Then they brought water in many golden vessels, washed the prince's<br>body besmeared before with several kinds of fragrant paste, and again<br>smeared it over with sandal paste. They then dressed it in a white dress<br>made of indigenous fabrics. And with the new suit on, the king seemed as<br>if he was living and only sleeping on a costly bed.<br><br>"When the other funeral ceremonies also were finished in consonance with<br>the directions of the priests, the Kauravas set fire to the dead bodies<br>of the king and the queen, bringing lotuses, sandal-paste, and other<br>fragrant substances to the pyre.<br><br>"Then seeing the bodies aflame, Kausalya burst out, 'O my son, my<br>son!'&#8212;and fell down senseless on the ground. And seeing her down the<br>citizens and the inhabitants of the provinces began to wail from grief<br>and affection for their king. And the birds of the air and the beasts of<br>the field were touched by the lamentations of Kunti. And Bhishma, the son<br>of Santanu, and the wise Vidura, and the others also that were there,<br>became disconsolate.<br><br>"Thus weeping, Bhishma, Vidura, Dhritarashtra, the Pandavas and the Kuru<br>ladies, all performed the watery ceremony of the king. And when all this<br>was over, the people, themselves filled with sorrow, began to console the<br>bereaved sons of Pandu. And the Pandavas with their friends began to<br>sleep on the ground. Seeing this the Brahmanas and the other citizens<br>also renounced their beds. Young and old, all the citizens grieved on<br>account of the sons of king Pandu, and passed twelve days in mourning<br>with the weeping Pandavas.'"
