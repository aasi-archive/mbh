                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Being thus addressed, and hearing that his sire was bearing<br>a dead snake, the powerful Sringin burned with wrath. And looking at<br>Krisa, and speaking softly, he asked him, 'Pray, why doth my father bear<br>today a dead snake?' And Krisa replied, 'Even as king Parikshit was<br>roving, for purpose of hunting, O dear one, he placed the dead snake on<br>the shoulder of thy sire.'<br><br>"And Sringin asked, 'What wrong was done to that wicked monarch by my<br>father? O Krisa, tell me this, and witness the power of my asceticism.'<br><br>"And Krisa answered, 'King Parikshit, the son of Abhimanyu, while<br>hunting, had wounded a fleet stag with an arrow and chased it alone. And<br>the king lost sight of the animal in that extensive wilderness. Seeing<br>then thy sire, he immediately accosted him. Thy sire was then observing<br>the vow of silence. Oppressed by hunger, thirst and labour, the prince<br>again and again asked thy sire sitting motionless, about the missing<br>deer. The sage, being under the vow of silence, returned no reply. The<br>king thereupon placed the snake on thy sire's shoulder with the end of<br>his bow. O Sringin, thy sire engaged in devotion is in the same posture<br>still. And the king also hath gone to his capital which is named after<br>the elephant!'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Having heard of a dead snake placed upon his<br>(father's) shoulders, the son of the Rishi, his eyes reddened with anger,<br>blazed up with rage. And possessed by anger, the puissant Rishi then<br>cursed the king, touching water and overcome with wrath.'<br><br>"And Sringin said, 'That sinful wretch of a monarch who hath placed a<br>dead snake on the shoulders of my lean and old parent, that insulter of<br>Brahmanas and tarnisher of the fame of the Kurus, shall be taken within<br>seven nights hence to the regions of Yama (Death) by the snake Takshaka,<br>the powerful king of serpents, stimulated thereto by the strength of my<br>words!'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'And having thus cursed (the king) from anger, Sringin<br>went to his father, and saw the sage sitting in the cow-pen, bearing the<br>dead snake. And seeing his parent in that plight, he was again inflamed<br>with ire. And he shed tears of grief, and addressed his sire, saying,<br>'Father, having been informed of this thy disgrace at the hands of that<br>wicked wretch, king Parikshit, I have from anger even cursed him; and<br>that worst of Kurus hath richly deserved my potent curse. Seven days<br>hence, Takshaka, the lord of snakes, shall take the sinful king to the<br>horrible abode of Death.' And the father said to the enraged son, 'Child,<br>I am not pleased with thee. Ascetics should not act thus. We live in the<br>domains of that great king. We are protected by him righteously. In all<br>he does, the reigning king should by the like of us forgiven. If thou<br>destroy Dharma, verily Dharma will destroy thee. If the king do not<br>properly protect us, we fare very ill; we cannot perform our religious<br>rites according to our desire. But protected by righteous sovereigns, we<br>attain immense merit, and they are entitled to a share thereof.<br>Therefore, reigning royalty is by all means to be forgiven. And Parikshit<br>like unto his great-grandsire, protecteth us as a king should protect his<br>subjects. That penance-practising monarch was fatigued and oppressed with<br>hunger. Ignorant of my vow (of silence) he did this. A kingless country<br>always suffereth from evils. The king punisheth offenders, and fear of<br>punishments conducteth to peace; and people do their duties and perform<br>their rites undisturbed. The king establisheth religion&#8212;establisheth the<br>kingdom of heaven. The king protecteth sacrifices from disturbance, and<br>sacrifices to please the gods. The gods cause rain, and rain produceth<br>grains and herbs, which are always useful to man. Manu sayeth, a ruler of<br>the destinies of men is equal (in dignity) to ten Veda-studying priests.<br>Fatigued and oppressed with hunger, that penance-practising prince hath<br>done this through ignorance of my vow. Why then hast thou rashly done<br>this unrighteous action through childishness? O son, in no way doth the<br>king deserve a curse from us.'"
