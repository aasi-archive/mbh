                            (Jatugriha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'The wicked Duryodhana became very pleased when the<br>king, O Bharata, had said so unto Pandavas. And, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, Duryodhana, then, summoning his counsellor, Purochana in private,<br>took hold of his right hand and said, 'O Purochana, this world, so full<br>of wealth, is mine. But it is thine equally with me. It behoveth thee,<br>therefore, to protect it. I have no more trustworthy counsellor than thee<br>with whom to consult. Therefore, O sire, keep my counsel and exterminate<br>my foes by a clever device. O, do as I bid thee. The Pandavas have, by<br>Dhritarashtra, been sent to Varanavata, where they will, at<br>Dhritarashtra's command, enjoy themselves during the festivities. Do that<br>by which thou mayest this very day reach Varanavata in a car drawn by<br>swift mules. Repairing thither, cause thou to be erected a quadrangular<br>palace in the neighbourhood of the arsenal, rich in the materials and<br>furniture, and guard thou the mansion well (with prying eyes). And use<br>thou (in erecting that house) hemp and resin and all other inflammable<br>materials that are procurable. And mixing a little earth with clarified<br>butter and oil and fat and a large quantity of lac, make thou a plaster<br>for lining the walls, and scatter thou all around that house hemp and oil<br>and clarified butter and lac and wood in such a way that the Pandavas, or<br>any others, may not, even with scrutiny behold them there or conclude the<br>house to be an inflammable one. And having erected such mansion, cause<br>thou the Pandavas, after worshipping them with great reverence, to dwell<br>in it with Kunti and all their friends. And place thou there seats and<br>conveyances and beds, all of the best workmanship, for the Pandavas, so<br>that Dhritarashtra may have no reason to complain. Thou must also so<br>manage it all that none of Varanavata may know anything till the end we<br>have in view is accomplished. And assuring thyself that the Pandavas are<br>sleeping within in confidence and without fear, thou must then set fire<br>to that mansion beginning at the outer door. The Pandavas thereupon must<br>be burnt to death, but the people will say that they have been burnt in<br>(an accidental) conflagration of their house.<br><br>"Saying, 'So be it' unto the Kuru prince, Purochana repaired to<br>Varanavata in a car drawn by fleet mules. And going thither, O king,<br>without loss of time, obedient to the instructions of Duryodhana, did<br>everything that the prince had bid him do."
