                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Garuda, thus addressed by the snakes, then said unto his<br>mother, 'I shall go to bring amrita, I desire to eat something in the<br>way. Direct me to it.' Vinata replied, 'In a remote region in the midst<br>of the ocean, the Nishadas have their fair home. Having eaten the<br>thousands of Nishadas that live there, bring thou amrita. But let not thy<br>heart be ever set on taking the life of a Brahmana. Of all creatures a<br>Brahmana must not be slain. He is, indeed, like fire. A Brahmana, when<br>angry, becomes like fire or the Sun, like poison or an edged weapon. A<br>Brahmana, it has been said, is the master of all creatures. For these and<br>other reasons, a Brahmana is the adored of the virtuous. O child, he is<br>never to be slain by thee even in anger. Hostility with Brahmanas,<br>therefore, would not be proper under any circumstances. O sinless one,<br>neither Agni nor Surya truly can consume so much as does a Brahmana of<br>rigid vows, when angry. By these various indications must thou know a<br>good Brahmana. Indeed, a brahmana is the first-born of all creatures, the<br>foremost of the four orders, the father and the master of all.'" Garuda<br>then asked, 'O mother, of what form is a Brahmana, of what behaviour, and<br>of what prowess? Doth he shine like fire, or is he of tranquil mien? And,<br>O mother, it behoveth thee to tell my inquiring self, those auspicious<br>signs by which I may recognise a Brahmana.'" Vinata replied, saying, 'O<br>child, him shouldst thou know as the best amongst Brahmanas who having<br>entered thy throat would torture thee as a fish-hook or burn thee as<br>blazing charcoal. A Brahmana must never be slain by thee even in anger.'<br>And Vinata out of affection for her son, again told him these words, 'Him<br>shouldst thou know as a good Brahmana who would not be digested in thy<br>stomach.' Although she knew the incomparable strength of her son, yet she<br>blessed him heartily, for, deceived by the snakes, she was very much<br>afflicted by woe. And she said. 'Let Marut (the god of the winds) protect<br>thy wings, and Surya and Soma thy vertebral regions; let Agni protect thy<br>head, and the Vasus thy whole body. I also, O child (engaged in<br>beneficial ceremonies), shall sit here for your welfare. Go then, O<br>child, in safety to accomplish thy purpose.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Then Garuda, having heard the words of his mother,<br>stretched his wings and ascended the skies. And endued with great<br>strength, he soon fell upon the Nishadas, hungry and like another Yama.<br>And bent upon slaying the Nishadas, he raised a great quantity of dust<br>that overspread the firmament, and sucking up water from amid the ocean,<br>shook the trees growing on the adjacent mountains. And then that lord of<br>birds obstructed the principal thoroughfares of the town of the Nishadas<br>by his mouth, increasing its orifice at will. And the Nishadas began to<br>fly in great haste in the direction of the open mouth of the great<br>serpent-eater. And as birds in great affliction ascend by thousand into<br>the skies when the trees in a forest are shaken by the winds, so those<br>Nishadas blinded by the dust raised by the storm entered the<br>wide-extending cleft of Garuda's mouth open to receive them. And then the<br>hungry lord of all rangers of the skies, that oppressor of enemies,<br>endued with great strength, and moving with greatest celerity to achieve<br>his end, closed his mouth, killing innumerable Nishadas following the<br>occupation of fishermen.'"<br><br>So ends the twenty-eighth section in the Astika Parva of Adi Parva.
