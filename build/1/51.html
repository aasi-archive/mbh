                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>'Sauti said, 'King Janamejaya having said so, his ministers expressed<br>their approbation. And the monarch then expressed his determination to<br>perform a snake-sacrifice. And that lord of the Earth&#8212;that tiger of the<br>Bharata race&#8212;the son of Parikshit, then called his priest and Ritwiks.<br>And accomplished in speech, he spake unto them these words relating to<br>the accomplishment of his great task. 'I must avenge myself on the wretch<br>Takshaka who killed my father. Tell me what I must do. Do you know any<br>act by which I may cast into the blazing fire the snake Takshaka with his<br>relatives? I desire to burn that wretch even as he burnt, of yore, by the<br>fire of his poison, my father.'<br><br>'The chief priest answered, 'There is, O king, a great sacrifice for thee<br>devised by the gods themselves. It is known as the snake-sacrifice, and<br>is read of in the Puranas. O king, thou alone canst accomplish it, and no<br>one else. Men versed in the Puranas have told us, there is such a<br>sacrifice.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Thus addressed, the king, O excellent one, thought<br>Takshaka to be already burnt and thrown into the blazing mouth of Agni,<br>the eater of the sacrificial butter. The king then said unto those<br>Brahmanas versed in mantras, 'I shall make preparations for that<br>sacrifice. Tell me the things that are necessary.' And the king's<br>Ritwiks, O excellent Brahmana, versed in the Vedas and acquainted with<br>the rites of that sacrifice measured, according to the scriptures, the<br>land for the sacrificial platform. And the platform was decked with<br>valuable articles and with Brahmanas. And it was full of precious things<br>and paddy. And the Ritwika sat upon it at ease. And after the sacrificial<br>platform had been thus constructed according to rule and as desired, they<br>installed the king at the snake-sacrifice for the attainment of its<br>object. And before the commencement of the snake-Sacrifice that was to<br>come, there occurred this very important incident foreboding obstruction<br>to the sacrifice. For when the sacrificial platform was being<br>constructed, a professional builder of great intelligence and well-versed<br>in the knowledge of laying foundations, a Suta by caste, well-acquainted<br>with the Puranas, said, 'The soil upon which and the time at which the<br>measurement for the sacrificial platform has been made, indicate that<br>this sacrifice will not be completed, a Brahmana becoming the reason<br>thereof.' Hearing this, the king, before his installation, gave orders to<br>his gate-keepers not to admit anybody without his knowledge."
