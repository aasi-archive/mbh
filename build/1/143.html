                            (Jatugriha Parva)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then the son of Suvala (Sakuni), king Duryodhana,<br>Duhsasana and Kama, in consultation with one another, formed an evil<br>conspiracy. With the sanction of Dhritarashtra, the king of the Kurus,<br>they resolved to burn to death Kunti and her (five) sons. But that wise<br>Vidura, capable of reading the heart by external signs, ascertained the<br>intention of these wicked persons by observing their countenances alone.<br>Then the sinless Vidura, of soul enlightened by true knowledge, and<br>devoted to the good of the Pandavas, came to the conclusion that Kunti<br>with her children should fly away from her foes. And providing for that<br>purpose a boat strong enough to withstand both wind and wave, he<br>addressed Kunti and said, 'This Dhritarashtra hath been born for<br>destroying the fame and offspring of the (Kuru) race. Of wicked soul, he<br>is about to cast off eternal virtue. O blessed one, I have kept ready on<br>the stream a boat capable of withstanding both wind and wave. Escape by<br>it with thy children from the net that death hath spread around you.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words, the illustrious Kunti was<br>deeply grieved, and with her children, O bull of Bharata's race, stepped<br>into the boat and went over the Ganges. Then leaving the boat according<br>to the advice of Vidura, the Pandavas took with them the wealth that had<br>been given to them (while at Varanavata) by their enemies and safely<br>entered the deep woods. In the house of lac, however, that had been<br>prepared for the destruction of the Pandavas, an innocent Nishada woman<br>who had come there for some purpose, was, with her children burnt to<br>death. And that worst of Mlechchhas, the wretched Purochana (who was the<br>architect employed in building the house of lac) was also burnt in the<br>conflagration. And thus were the sons of Dhirtarashtra with their<br>counsellors deceived in their expectations. And thus also were the<br>illustrious Pandavas, by the advice of Vidura, saved with their mother.<br>But the people (of Varanavata) knew not of their safety. And the citizens<br>of Varanavata, seeing the house of lac consumed (and believing the<br>Pandavas to have been burnt to death) became exceedingly sorry. And they<br>sent messengers unto king Dhritarashtra to represent everything that had<br>happened. And they said to the monarch, 'Thy great end hath been<br>achieved! Thou hast at last burnt the Pandavas to death! Thy desire<br>fulfilled, enjoy with thy children. O king of the Kurus, the kingdom.'<br>Hearing this, Dhritarashtra with his children, made a show of grief, and<br>along with his relatives, including Kshattri (Vidura) and Bhishma the<br>foremost of the Kurus, performed the last honours of the Pandavas.'<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'O best of Brahmanas, I desire to hear in full this<br>history of the burning of the house of lac and the escape of the Pandavas<br>there from. That was a cruel act of theirs (the Kurus), acting under the<br>counsels of the wicked (Kanika). Recite the history to me of all that<br>happened. I am burning with curiosity to hear it.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'O chastiser of all foes, listen to me, O monarch, as<br>I recite the (history of the) burning of the house of lac and the escape<br>of the Pandavas. The wicked Duryodhana, beholding Bhimasena surpass<br>(everybody) in strength and Arjuna highly accomplished in arms became<br>pensive and sad. Then Karna, the offspring of the Sun, and Sakuni, the<br>son of Suvala, endeavoured by various means to compass the death of the<br>Pandavas. The Pandavas too counteracted all those contrivances one after<br>another, and in obedience to the counsels of Vidura, never spoke of them<br>afterwards. Then the citizens, beholding the son of Pandu possessed of<br>accomplishments, began, O Bharata, to speak of them in all places of<br>public resort. And assembled in courtyards and other places of gathering,<br>they talked of the eldest son of Pandu (Yudhishthira) as possessed of the<br>qualifications for ruling the kingdom. And they said, 'Dhritarashtra,<br>though possessed of the eye of knowledge, having been (born) blind, had<br>not obtained the kingdom before. How can he (therefore) become king now?<br>Then Bhishma, the son of Santanu, of rigid vows and devoted to truth,<br>having formerly relinquished the sovereignty would never accept it now.<br>We shall, therefore, now install (on the throne) with proper ceremonies<br>the eldest of the Pandavas endued with youth, accomplished in battle,<br>versed in the Vedas, and truthful and kind. Worshipping Bhishma, the son<br>of Santanu and Dhritarashtra conversant with the rules of morality, he<br>will certainly maintain the former and the latter with his children in<br>every kind of enjoyment.<br><br>"The wretched Duryodhana, hearing these words of the parting partisans of<br>Yudhishthira, became very much distressed. Deeply afflicted, the wicked<br>prince could not put up with those speeches. Inflamed with jealousy, he<br>went unto Dhritarashtra, and finding him alone he saluted him with<br>reverence and distressed at (the sight of) the partiality of the citizens<br>for Yudhishthira, he addressed the monarch and said, 'O father, I have<br>heard the parting citizens utter words of ill omen. Passing thee by, and<br>Bhishma too, they desire the son of Pandu to be their king. Bhishma will<br>sanction this, for he will not rule the kingdom. It seems, therefore,<br>that the citizens are endeavouring to inflict a great injury on us. Pandu<br>obtained of old the ancestral kingdom by virtue of his own<br>accomplishments, but thou, from blindness, didst not obtain the kingdom,<br>though fully qualified to have it. If Pandu's son now obtaineth the<br>kingdom as his inheritance from Pandu, his son will obtain it after him<br>and that son's son also, and so on will it descend in Pandu's line. In<br>that case, O king of the world, ourselves with our children, excluded<br>from the royal line, shall certainly be disregarded by all men.<br>Therefore, O monarch, adopt such counsels that we may not suffer<br>perpetual distress, becoming dependent on others for our food. O king, if<br>thou hadst obtained the sovereignty before, we would certainly have<br>succeeded to it, however much the people might be unfavourable to us.'"
