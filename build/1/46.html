                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said. 'Jaratkaru, hearing all this, became excessively dejected.<br>And from sorrow he spoke unto those Pitris in words obstructed by tears.'<br>And Jaratkaru said, 'Ye are even my fathers and grand-fathers gone<br>before. Therefore, tell me what I must do for your welfare. I am that<br>sinful son of yours, Jaratkaru! Punish me for my sinful deeds, a wretch<br>that I am.'<br><br>"The Pitris replied, saying, 'O son, by good luck hast thou arrived at<br>this spot in course of thy rambles. O Brahmana, why hast thou not taken a<br>wife?'<br><br>"Jaratkaru said. 'Ye Pitris, this desire hath always existed in my heart<br>that I would, with vital seed drawn up, carry this body to the other<br>world. My mind hath been possessed with the idea that I would not take a<br>wife. But ye grandsires, having seen you hanging like birds, I have<br>diverted my mind from the Brahmacharya mode of life. I will truly do what<br>you like. I will certainly marry, if ever I meet with a maiden of my own<br>name. I shall accept her who, bestowing herself of her own accord, will<br>be as aims unto me, and whom I shall not have to maintain. I shall marry<br>if I get such a one; otherwise, I shall not. This is the truth, ye<br>grandsires! And the offspring that will be begot upon her shall be your<br>salvation. And ye Pitris of mine, ye shall live for ever in blessedness<br>and without fear.'<br><br>'Sauti continued, 'The Muni, having said so unto the Pitris, wandered<br>over the earth again. And, O Saunaka, being old, he obtained no wife. And<br>he grieved much that he was not successful. But directed (as before) by<br>his ancestors, he continued the search. And going into the forest, he<br>wept loudly in great grief. And having gone into the forest, the wise<br>one, moved by the desire of doing good to his ancestors, said, 'I will<br>ask for a bride,' distinctly repeating these words thrice. And he said,<br>'Whatever creatures are here, mobile and immobile, so whoever there be<br>that are invisible, O, hear my words! My ancestors, afflicted with grief,<br>have directed me that am engaged in the most severe penances, saying,<br>'Marry thou for (the acquisition of) a son.' 'O ye, being directed by my<br>ancestors, I am roaming in poverty and sorrow, over the wide world for<br>wedding a maiden that I may obtain as alms. Let that creature, amongst<br>those I have addressed, who hath a daughter, bestow on me that am roaming<br>far and near. Such a bride as is of same name with me, to be bestowed on<br>me as alms, and whom, besides, I shall not maintain, O bestow on me!'<br>Then those snakes that had been set upon Jaratkaru track, ascertaining<br>his inclination, gave information to Vasuki. And the king of the snakes,<br>hearing their words, took with him that maiden decked with ornaments, and<br>went into the forest unto that Rishi. And, O Brahmana, Vasuki, the king<br>of the snakes, having gone there, offered that maiden as alms unto that<br>high-souled Rishi. But the Rishi did not at once accept her. And the<br>Rishi, thinking her not to be of the same name with himself, and seeing<br>that the question of her maintenance also was unsettled, reflected for a<br>few moments, hesitating to accept her. And then, O son of Bhrigu, he<br>asked Vasuki the maiden's name, and also said unto him, 'I shall not<br>maintain her.'"
