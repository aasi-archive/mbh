                            (Chaitraratha Parva continued)<br><br>"The Gandharva said, 'Vasishtha after this, continued the narration<br>saying, 'Hearing these words of the Pitris, Aurva, O child, replied unto<br>them to this effect:<br><br>'Ye Pitris, the vow I have made from anger for the destruction of all the<br>worlds, must not go in vain. I cannot consent to be one whose anger and<br>vows are futile. Like fire consuming dry woods, this rage of mine will<br>certainly consume me if I do not accomplish my vow. The man that<br>represseth his wrath that hath been excited by (adequate) cause, becometh<br>incapable of duly compassing the three ends of life (viz., religion,<br>profit and pleasure). The wrath that kings desirous of subjugating the<br>whole earth exhibit, is not without its uses. It serveth to restrain the<br>wicked and to protect the honest. While lying unborn within my mother's<br>thigh, I heard the doleful cries of my mother and other women of the<br>Bhrigu race who were then being exterminated by the Kshatriyas. Ye<br>Pitris, when those wretches of Kshatriyas began to exterminate the<br>Bhrigus together with unborn children of their race, it was then that<br>wrath filled my soul. My mother and the other women of our race, each in<br>an advanced state of pregnancy, and my father, while terribly alarmed,<br>found not in all the worlds a single protector. Then when the Bhrigu<br>women found not a single protector, my mother held me in one of her<br>thighs. If there be a punisher of crimes in the worlds no one in all the<br>worlds would dare commit a crime; if he findeth not a punisher, the<br>number of sinners becometh large. The man who having the power to prevent<br>or punish sin doth not do so knowing that a sin hath been committed, is<br>himself defiled by that sin. When kings and others, capable of protecting<br>my fathers, protect them not, postponing that duty preferring the<br>pleasures of life, I have just cause to be enraged with them. I am the<br>lord of the creation, capable of punishing its iniquity. I am incapable<br>of obeying your command. Capable of punishing this crime, if I abstain<br>from so doing, men will once more have to undergo a similar persecution.<br>The fire of my wrath too that is ready to consume the worlds, if<br>repressed, will certainly consume by its own energy my own self. Ye<br>masters, I know that ye ever seek the good of the worlds: direct me,<br>therefore, as to what may benefit both myself and the worlds.'<br><br>"Vasishtha continued, 'The Pitris replied saying, O, throw this fire that<br>is born of thy wrath and that desireth to consume the worlds, into the<br>waters. That will do thee good. The worlds, indeed, are all dependent on<br>water (as their elementary cause). Every juicy substance containeth<br>water, indeed the whole universe is made of water. Therefore, O thou best<br>of Brahmanas, cast thou this fire of thy wrath into the waters. If,<br>therefore, thou desirest it, O Brahmana, let this fire born of thy wrath<br>abide in the great ocean, consuming the waters thereof, for it hath been<br>said that the worlds are made of water. In this way, O thou sinless one,<br>thy word will be rendered true, and the worlds with the gods will not be<br>destroyed.'<br><br>"Vasishtha continued, 'Then, O child, Aurva cast the fire of his wrath<br>into the abode of Varuna. And that fire which consumeth the waters of the<br>great ocean, became like unto a large horse's head which persons<br>conversant with the Vedas call by the name of Vadavamukha. And emitting<br>itself from that mouth it consumeth the waters of the mighty ocean. Blest<br>be thou! It behoveth not thee, therefore, to destroy the worlds. O thou<br>Parasara, who art acquainted with the higher regions, thou foremost of<br>wise men!'"
