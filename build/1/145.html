                            (Jatugriha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, Then prince Duryodhana, along with his brothers began<br>to gradually win over the people to his side by grants of wealth and<br>honours. Meanwhile, some clever councillors, instructed by Dhritarashtra,<br>one day began to describe (in court) the town of Varanavata as a charming<br>place. And they said, The festival of Pasupati (Siva) hath commenced in<br>the town of Varanavata. The concourse of people is great and the<br>procession is the most delightful of all ever witnessed on earth. Decked<br>with every ornament, it charmed the hearts of all spectators.' Thus did<br>those councillors, instructed by Dhritarashtra, speak of Varanavata, and<br>whilst they were so speaking, the Pandavas, O king, felt the desire of<br>going to that delightful town. And when the king (Dhritarashtra)<br>ascertained that the curiosity of the Pandavas had been awakened, the son<br>of Ambika addressed them, saying, 'These men of mine often speak of<br>Varanavata as the most delightful town in the world. If therefore, ye<br>children, ye desire to witness that festival, go to Varanavata with your<br>followers and friends and enjoy yourselves there like the celestials. And<br>give ye away pearls and gems unto the Brahmanas and the musicians (that<br>may be assembled there). And sporting there for some time as ye please<br>like the resplendent celestials and enjoying as much pleasure as ye like,<br>return ye to Hastinapura again.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Yudhishthira, fully understanding the motives<br>of Dhritarashtra and considering that he himself was weak and friendless,<br>replied unto the king, saying, 'So be it.' Then addressing Bhishma, the<br>son of Santanu, the wise Vidura, Drona, Valhika, the Kaurava, Somadatta,<br>Kripa, Aswatthaman, Bhurisravas, and the other councillors, and Brahmanas<br>and ascetics, and the priests and the citizens, and the illustrious<br>Gandhari, he said slowly and humbly, 'With our friends and followers we<br>go to the delightful and populous town of Varanavata at the command of<br>Dhritarashtra. Cheerfully give us your benedictions so that acquiring<br>prosperity, therewith we may not be touched by sin.' Thus addressed by<br>the eldest of Pandu's sons, the Kaurava chiefs all cheerfully pronounced<br>blessings on them, saying, 'Ye sons of Pandu, let all the elements bless<br>you along your way and let not the slightest evil befall you.'<br><br>"The Pandavas, having performed propitiatory rites for obtaining (their<br>share of) the kingdom, and finishing their preparations, set out for<br>Varanavata.'"
