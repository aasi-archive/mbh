                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'The godlike Rishis, wise in counsels, beholding the<br>death of Pandu, consulted with one another, and said, 'The virtuous and<br>renowned king Pandu, abandoning both sovereignty, and kingdom came hither<br>for practising ascetic austerities and resigned himself to the ascetics<br>dwelling on this mountain. He hath hence ascended to heaven, leaving his<br>wife and infant sons as a trust in our hands. Our duty now is to repair<br>to his kingdom with these his offspring, and his wife.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then those godlike Rishis of magnanimous<br>hearts, and crowned with ascetic success, summoning one another, resolved<br>to go to Hastinapura with Pandu's children ahead, desiring to place them<br>in the hands of Bhishma and Dhritarashtra. The ascetics set out that very<br>moment, taking with them those children and Kunti and the two dead<br>bodies. And though unused to toil all her life, the affectionate Kunti<br>now regarded as very short the really long journey she had to perform.<br>Having arrived at Kurujangala within a short time, the illustrious Kunti<br>presented herself at the principal gate. The ascetics then charged the<br>porters to inform the king of their arrival. The men carried the message<br>in a trice to the court. And the citizens of Hastinapura, hearing of the<br>arrival of thousands of Charanas and Munis, were filled with wonder. And<br>it was soon after sunrise that they began to come out in numbers with<br>their wives and children to behold those ascetics. Seated in all kinds of<br>cars and conveyances by thousands, vast numbers of Kshatriyas with their<br>wives, and Brahmanas with theirs came out. And the concourse of Vaisyas<br>and Sudras too was as large on the occasion. The vast assemblage was very<br>peaceful, for every heart then was inclined to piety. And there also came<br>out Bhishma, the son of Santanu, and Somadatta or Valhika and the royal<br>sage (Dhritarashtra) endued with the vision of knowledge and Vidura<br>himself and the venerable Satyavati and the illustrious princess of<br>Kosala and Gandhari accompanied by the other ladies of the royal<br>household. And the hundred sons of Dhritarashtra, decked with various<br>ornaments, also came out.<br><br>"The Kauravas, then, accompanied by their priest, saluted the Rishis by<br>lowering their heads, and took their seats before them. The citizens also<br>saluting the ascetics and bowing down unto them with touching the ground,<br>took their seats there. Then Bhishma, setting that vast concourse<br>perfectly still, duly worshipped, O king, those ascetics by offering them<br>water to wash their feet with and the customary Arghya. And having done<br>this, he spoke unto them about the sovereignty and the kingdom. Then the<br>oldest of the ascetics with matted locks on head and loins covered with<br>animal skin, stood up, and with the concurrence of the other Rishis,<br>spoke as follows, 'You all know that that possessor of the sovereignty of<br>the Kurus who was called king Pandu, had, after abandoning the pleasures<br>of the world, repaired hence to dwell on the mountain of a hundred peaks.<br>He adopted the Brahmacharya mode of life, but for some inscrutable<br>purpose the gods have in view, this his eldest son, Yudhishthira, was<br>born there, begotten by Dharma himself. Then that illustrious king<br>obtained from Vayu this other son&#8212;the foremost of all mighty men&#8212;called<br>Bhima. This other son, begotten upon Kunti by Indra, is Dhananjaya whose<br>achievements will humble all bowmen in the world. Look here again at<br>these tigers among men, mighty in the use of the bow, the twin children<br>begotten upon Madri by the twin Aswins. Leading in righteousness the life<br>of a Vanaprastha in the woods, illustrious Pandu hath thus revived the<br>almost extinct line of his grandfather. The birth, growth, and Vedic<br>studies of these children of Pandu, will, no doubt, give you great<br>pleasure. Steadily adhering to the path of the virtuous and the wise, and<br>leaving behind him these children, Pandu departed hence seventeen days<br>ago. His wife Madri, beholding him placed in the funeral pyre and about<br>to be consumed, herself ascended the same pyre, and sacrificing her life<br>thus, hath gone with her lord to the region reserved for chaste wives.<br>Accomplish now whatever rites should be performed for their benefit.<br>These are (the unburnt portions of) their bodies. Here also are their<br>children&#8212;these oppressors of foes&#8212;with their mother. Let these be now<br>received with due honours. After the completion of the first rites in<br>honour of the dead, let the virtuous Pandu, who had all along been the<br>supporter of the dignity of the Kurus, have the first annual Sraddha<br>(sapindakarana) performed with a view to installing him formally among<br>the Pitris.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The ascetics with Guhyakas, having said this<br>unto the Kurus, instantly disappeared in the very sight of the people.<br>And beholding the Rishis and the Siddhas thus vanish in their sight like<br>vapoury forms appearing and disappearing in the skies, the citizens<br>filled with wonder returned to their homes.'"
