                            (Sambhava Parva)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then Indra had a consultation with Narayana about<br>the latter's descent on the earth from heaven with all the gods according<br>to their respective parts. And, having commanded all the dwellers in<br>heaven, Indra returned from the abode of Narayana. And the dwellers in<br>heaven gradually became incarnate on earth for the destruction of the<br>Asuras and for the welfare of the three worlds. And then, O tiger among<br>kings, the celestials had their births, according as they pleased, in the<br>races of Brahmarshis and royal sages. And they slew the Danavas,<br>Rakshasas, Gandharvas and Snakes, other man-eaters, and many other<br>creatures. And, O bull in the Bharata race, the Danavas, Rakshasas and<br>Gandharvas and Snakes, could not slay the incarnate celestials even in<br>their infancy, so strong they were.'<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'I desire to hear from the beginning of the births of<br>the gods, the Danavas, the Gandharvas, the Apsaras, men, Yakshas and<br>Rakshasas. Therefore, it behoveth thee to tell me about the births of all<br>creatures.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Indeed, I shall, having bowed down to the<br>Self-create, tell thee in detail the origin of the celestials and other<br>creatures. It is known that Brahman hath six spiritual sons, viz.,<br>Marichi, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha and Kratu. And Marichi's son is<br>Kasyapa, and from Kasyapa have sprung these creatures. Unto Daksha (one<br>of the Prajapatis) were born thirteen daughters of great good fortune.<br>The daughters of Daksha are, O tiger among men and prince of the Bharata<br>race, Aditi, Diti, Danu, Kala, Danayu, Sinhika, Krodha, Pradha, Viswa,<br>Vinata, Kapila, Muni, and Kadru. The sons and grandsons of these, gifted<br>with great energy, are countless. From Aditi have sprung the twelve<br>Adityas who are the lords of the universe. And, O Bharata, as they are<br>according to their names, I shall recount them to thee. They are Dhatri,<br>Mitra, Aryaman, Sakra, Varuna, Ansa, Vaga, Vivaswat, Usha, Savitri,<br>Tvashtri, and Vishnu. The youngest, however, is superior to them all in<br>merit. Diti had one son called Hiranyakasipu. And the illustrious<br>Hiranyakasipu had five sons, all famous throughout the world. The eldest<br>of them all was Prahlada, the next was Sahradha; the third was Anuhrada;<br>and after him were Sivi and Vashkala. And, O Bharata, it is known<br>everywhere that Prahlada had three sons. They were Virochana, Kumbha, and<br>Nikumbha. And unto Virochana was born a son, Vali, of great prowess. And<br>the son of Vali is known to be the great Asura, Vana. And blessed with<br>good fortune, Vana was a follower of Rudra, and was known also by the<br>name of Mahakala. And Danu had forty sons, O Bharata! The eldest of them<br>all was Viprachitti of great fame Samvara, and Namuchi and Pauloman;<br>Asiloman, and Kesi and Durjaya; Ayahsiras, Aswasiras, and the powerful<br>Aswasanku; also Gaganamardhan, and Vegavat, and he called Ketumat;<br>Swarbhanu, Aswa, Aswapati, Vrishaparvan, and then Ajaka; and Aswagriva,<br>and Sukshama, and Tuhunda of great strength, Ekapada, and Ekachakra,<br>Virupaksha, Mahodara, and Nichandra, and Nikumbha, Kupata, and then<br>Kapata; Sarabha, and Sulabha, Surya, and then Chandramas; these in the<br>race of Danu are stated to be well-known. The Surya and Chandramas (the<br>Sun and the Moon) of the celestials are other persons, and not the sons<br>of Danu as mentioned above. The following ten, gifted with great strength<br>and vigour, were also, O king, born in the race of Danu;&#8212;Ekaksha,<br>Amritapa of heroic courage, Pralamva and Naraka, Vatrapi, Satrutapana,<br>and Satha, the great Asura; Gavishtha, and Vanayu, and the Danava called<br>Dirghajiva. And, O Bharata, the sons and the grandsons of these were<br>known to be countless. And Sinhika gave birth to Rahu, the persecutor of<br>the Sun and the Moon, and to three others, Suchandra, Chandrahantri, and<br>Chandrapramardana. And the countless progeny of Krura (krodha) were as<br>crooked and wicked as herself. And the tribe was wrathful, of crooked<br>deeds, and persecutors of their foes. And Danayu also had four sons who<br>were bulls among the Asuras. They were Vikshara, Vala, Vira, and Vritra<br>the great Asura. And the sons of Kala were all like Yama himself and<br>smiter of all foes. And they were of great energy, and oppressors of all<br>foes. And the sons of Kala were Vinasana and Krodha, and then<br>Krodhahantri, and Krodhasatru. And there were many others among the sons<br>of Kala. And Sukra, the son of a Rishi, was the chief priest of the<br>Asuras. And the celebrated Sukra had four sons who were priests of the<br>Asuras. And they were Tashtadhara and Atri, and two others of fierce<br>deeds. They were like the Sun himself in energy, and set their hearts on<br>acquiring the regions of Brahman.<br><br>"Thus hath been recited by me, as heard in the Purana, of progeny of the<br>gods and the Asuras, both of great strength and energy. I am incapable, O<br>king, of counting the descendants of these, countless as they are, are<br>not much known to fame.<br><br>"And the sons of Vinata were Tarkhya and Arishtanemi, and Garuda and<br>Aruna, and Aruni and Varuni. And Sesha or Ananta, Vasuki, Takshaka,<br>Kumara, and Kulika are known to be the sons of Kadru; and Bhimasena,<br>Ugrasena, Suparna, Varuna, Gopati, and Dhritarashtra, and Suryavarchas<br>the seventh, Satyavachas, Arkaparna, Prayuta, Bhima, and Chitraratha<br>known to fame, of great learning, and a controller of his passions, and<br>then Kalisiras, and, O king, Parjanya, the fourteenth in the list, Kali,<br>the fifteenth, and Narada, the sixteenth&#8212;these Devas and Gandharvas are<br>known to be the sons of Muni (Daksha's daughter as mentioned before). I<br>shall recount many others, O Bharata! Anavadya Manu, Vansa, Asura,<br>Marganapria, Anupa, Subhaga, Vasi, were the daughters brought forth by<br>Pradha, Siddha, and Purna, and Varhin, and Purnayus of great fame,<br>Brahmacharin, Ratiguna, and Suparna who was the seventh; Viswavasu,<br>Bhanu, and Suchandra who was the tenth, were also the sons of Pradha. All<br>these were celestial Gandharvas. And it is also known that this Pradha of<br>great fortune, through the celestial Rishi (Kasyapa, her husband),<br>brought forth the sacred of the Apsaras, Alamvusha, Misrakesi,<br>Vidyutparna, Tilottama, Aruna, Rakshita, Rambha, Manorama, Kesini,<br>Suvahu, Surata, Suraja, and Supria were the daughters, and Ativahu and<br>the celebrated Haha and Huhu, and Tumvuru were the sons&#8212;the best of<br>Gandharvas&#8212;of Pradha and Amrita. The Brahmanas, kine, Gandharvas, and<br>Apsaras, were born of Kapila as stated in the Purana.<br><br>"Thus hath been recited to thee by me the birth of all creatures duly&#8212;of<br>Gandharvas and Apsaras, of Snakes, Suparnas, Rudras, and Maruts; of kine<br>and of Brahmanas blessed with great good fortune, and of sacred deeds.<br>And this account (if read) extendeth the span of life, is sacred, worthy<br>of all praise, and giveth pleasure to the ear. It should be always heard<br>and recited to others, in a proper frame of mind.<br><br>"He who duly readeth this account of the birth of all high-souled<br>creatures in the presence of the gods and Brahmanas, obtaineth large<br>progeny, good fortune, and fame, and attaineth also to excellent worlds<br>hereafter.'"
