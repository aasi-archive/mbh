                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Saunaka said, 'O son of Suta, I desire to know the reason why the<br>illustrious Rishi whom thou hast named Jaratkaru came to be so called on<br>earth. It behoveth thee to tell us the etymology of the name Jaratkaru.'<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Jara is said to mean waste, and Karu implies huge. This<br>Rishi's body had been huge, and he gradually reduced it by severe ascetic<br>penances. For the same reason, O Brahmanas, the sister of Vasuki was<br>called Jaratkaru.'<br><br>The virtuous Saunaka, when he heard this, smiled and addressing<br>Ugrasravas said, 'It is even so.'<br><br>Saunaka then said, 'I have heard all that thou hast before recited. I<br>desire to know how Astika was born.'<br><br>Sauti, on hearing these words, began to relate according to what was<br>written in the Sastras.<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Vasuki, desirous of bestowing his sister upon the Rishi<br>Jaratkaru, gave the snakes (necessary) orders. But days went on, yet that<br>wise Muni of rigid vows, deeply engaged in ascetic devotions, did not<br>seek for a wife. That high-souled Rishi, engaged in studies and deeply<br>devoted to asceticism, his vital seed under full control, fearlessly<br>wandered over the whole earth and had no wish for a wife.<br><br>"Afterwards, once upon a time, there was a king, O Brahmana, of the name<br>of Parikshit, born in the race of the Kauravas. And, like his<br>great-grandfather Pandu of old, he was of mighty arms, the first of all<br>bearers of bows in battle, and fond of hunting. And the monarch wandered<br>about, hunting deer, and wild boars, and wolves, and buffaloes and<br>various other kinds of wild animals. One day, having pierced a deer with<br>a sharp arrow and slung his bow on his back, he penetrated into the deep<br>forest, searching for the animal here and there, like the illustrious<br>Rudra himself of old pursuing in the heavens, bow in hand, the deer which<br>was Sacrifice, itself turned into that shape, after the piercing. No deer<br>that was pierced by Parikshit had ever escaped in the wood with life.<br>This deer, however wounded as before, fled with speed, as the (proximate)<br>cause of the king's attainment to heaven. And the deer that<br>Parikshit&#8212;that king of men&#8212;had pierced was lost to his gaze and drew<br>the monarch far away into the forest. And fatigued and thirsty, he came<br>across a Muni, in the forest, seated in a cow-pen and drinking to his<br>fill the froth oozing out of the mouths of calves sucking the milk of<br>their dams. And approaching him hastily, the monarch, hungry and<br>fatigued, and raising his bow, asked that Muni of rigid vows, saying, 'O<br>Brahmana, I am king Parikshit, the son of Abhimanyu. A deer pierced by me<br>hath been lost. Hast thou seen it?' But that Muni observing then the vow<br>of silence, spoke not unto him a word. And the king in anger thereupon<br>placed upon his shoulder a dead snake, taking it up with the end of his<br>bow. The Muni suffered him to do it without protest. And he spoke not a<br>word, good or bad. And the king seeing him in that state, cast off his<br>anger and became sorry. And he returned to his capital but the Rishi<br>continued in the same state. The forgiving Muni, knowing that the monarch<br>who was a tiger amongst kings was true to the duties of his order, cursed<br>him not, though insulted. That tiger amongst monarchs, that foremost one<br>of Bharata's race, also did not know that the person whom he had so<br>insulted was a virtuous Rishi. It was for this that he had so insulted<br>him.<br><br>"That Rishi had a son by name Sringin, of tender years, gifted with great<br>energy, deep in ascetic penances, severe in his vows, very wrathful, and<br>difficult to be appeased. At times, he worshipped with great attention<br>and respect his preceptor seated with ease on his seat and ever engaged<br>in the good of creatures.<br><br>"And commanded by his preceptor, he was coming home when, O best of<br>Brahmanas, a companion of his, a Rishi's son named Krisa in a playful<br>mood laughingly spoke unto him. And Sringin, wrathful and like unto<br>poison itself, hearing these words in reference to his father, blazed up<br>in rage.'<br><br>"And Krisa said, 'Be not proud, O Sringin, for ascetic as thou art and<br>possessed of energy, thy father bears on his shoulders a dead snake.<br>Henceforth speak not a word to sons of Rishis like ourselves who have<br>knowledge of the truth, are deep in ascetic penances, and have attained<br>success. Where is that manliness of thine, those high words of thine<br>begotten of pride, when thou must have to behold thy father bearing a<br>dead snake? O best of all the Munis, thy father too had done nothing to<br>deserve this treatment, and it is for this that I am particularly sorry<br>as if the punishment were mine.'"
