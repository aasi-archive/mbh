                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Then the councillors beholding the king in the coils of<br>Takshaka, became pale with fear and wept in exceeding grief. And hearing<br>the roar of Takshaka, the ministers all fled. And as they were flying<br>away in great grief, they saw Takshaka, the king of snakes, that<br>wonderful serpent, coursing through the blue sky like a streak of the hue<br>of the lotus, and looking very much like the vermilion-coloured line on a<br>woman's crown dividing the dark masses of her hair in the middle.<br><br>"And the mansion in which the king was living blazed up with Takshaka's<br>poison. And the king's councillors, on beholding it, fled away in all<br>directions. And the king himself fell down, as if struck by lightning.<br><br>"And when the king was laid low by Takshaka's poison, his councillors<br>with the royal priest&#8212;a holy Brahmana&#8212;performed all his last rites. All<br>the citizens, assembling together, made the minor son of the deceased<br>monarch their king. And the people called their new king, that slayer of<br>all enemies, that hero of the Kuru race, by the name of Janamejaya. And<br>that best of monarchs, Janamejaya, though a child, was wise in mind. And<br>with his councillors and priest, the eldest son Parikshita, that bull<br>amongst the Kurus, ruled the kingdom like his heroic great-grand-father<br>(Yudhishthira). And the ministers of the youthful monarch, beholding that<br>he could now keep his enemies in check, went to Suvarnavarman, the king<br>of Kasi, and asked him his daughter Vapushtama for a bride. And the king<br>of Kasi, after due inquiries, bestowed with ordained rites, his daughter<br>Vapushtama on that mighty hero of Kuru race. And the latter, receiving<br>his bride, became exceedingly glad. And he gave not his heart at any time<br>to any other woman. And gifted with great energy, he wandered in pursuit<br>of pleasure, with a cheerful heart, on expanses of water and amid woods<br>and flowery fields. And that first of monarchs passed his time in<br>pleasure as Pururavas of old did, on receiving the celestial damsel<br>Urvasi. Herself fairest of the fair, the damsel Vapushtama too, devoted<br>to her lord and celebrated for her beauty having gained a desirable<br>husband, pleased him by the excess of her affection during the period he<br>spent in the pursuit of pleasure.'"
