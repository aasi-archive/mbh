                            (Jatugriha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'A friend of Vidura's, well-skilled in mining,<br>coming unto the Pandavas, addressed them in secret, saying, 'I have been<br>sent by Vidura and am a skilful miner. I am to serve the Pandavas. Tell<br>me what I am to do for ye. From the trust he reposeth in me Vidura hath<br>said unto me, 'Go thou unto the Pandavas and accomplish thou their good.<br>What shall I do for you? Purochana will set fire to the door of thy house<br>on the fourteenth night of this dark fortnight. To burn to death those<br>tigers among men, the Pandavas, with their mother, is the design of that<br>wicked wretch, the son of Dhritarashtra. O son of Pandu, Vidura also told<br>thee something in the Mlechchha tongue to which thou also didst reply in<br>same language. I state these particulars as my credentials.' Hearing<br>these words, Yudhishthira, the truthful son of Kunti replied, 'O amiable<br>one, I now know thee as a dear and trusted friend of Vidura, true and<br>ever devoted to him. There is nothing that the learned Vidura doth not<br>know. As his, so ours art thou. Make no difference between him and us. We<br>are as much thine as his. O, protect us as the learned Vidura ever<br>protecteth us. I know that this house, so inflammable, hath been<br>contrived for me by Purochana at the command of Dhritarashtra's son. That<br>wicked wretch commanding wealth and allies pursueth us without<br>intermission. O, save us with a little exertion from the impending<br>conflagration. If we are burnt to death here, Duryodhana's most cherished<br>desire will be satisfied. Here is that wretch's well-furnished arsenal.<br>This large mansion hath been built abutting the high ramparts of the<br>arsenal without any outlet. But this unholy contrivance of Duryodhana was<br>known to Vidura from the first, and he it was who enlightened us<br>beforehand. The danger of which Kshattri had foreknowledge is now at our<br>door. Save us from it without Purochana's knowledge thereof.' On hearing<br>these words, the miner said, 'So be it,' and carefully beginning his work<br>of excavation, made a large subterranean passage. And the mouth of that<br>passage was in the centre of that house, and it was on a level with the<br>floor and closed up with planks. The mouth was so covered from fear of<br>Purochana, that wicked wretch who kept a constant watch at the door of<br>the house. The Pandavas used to sleep within their chambers with arms<br>ready for use, while, during the day, they went a-hunting from forest to<br>forest. Thus, O king, they lived (in that mansion) very guardedly,<br>deceiving Purochana by a show of trustfulness and contentment while in<br>reality they were trustless and discontented. Nor did the citizens of<br>Varanavata know anything about these plans of the Pandavas. In fact, none<br>else knew of them except Vidura's friend, that good miner.'"
