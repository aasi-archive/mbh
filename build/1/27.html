                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'And then the Nagas drenched by that shower, became<br>exceedingly glad. And borne by that bird of fair feathers, they soon<br>arrived at the island. That island had been fixed by the Creator of the<br>Universe as the abode of the makaras. There they saw the terrible Lavana<br>Samudra (ocean of salt). On arriving there with Garuda, they saw there a<br>beautiful forest washed by the waters of the sea and resounding with the<br>music of winged choirs. And there were clusters of trees all around laden<br>with various fruits and flowers. And there were also fair mansions all<br>around; and many tanks full of lotuses. And it was also adorned with many<br>lakes of pure water. And it was refreshed with pure incense-breathing<br>breezes. And it was adorned with many a tree that grew only on the hills<br>of Malaya, and seemed by their tallness to reach the very heavens. And<br>there were also various other trees whose flowers were scattered all<br>around by the breeze. And that forest was charming and dear to the<br>Gandharvas and always gave them pleasure. And it was full of bees<br>maddened with the honey they sucked. And the sight of all this was<br>exceedingly delightful. And in consequence of many things there, capable<br>of charming everybody, that forest was fair, delightful, and holy. And,<br>echoing with the notes of various birds, it delighted greatly the sons of<br>Kadru.<br><br>"And the snakes, after arriving at that forest, began to enjoy<br>themselves. And they commanded the lord of birds, viz., Garuda, of great<br>energy, saying, 'Convey us to some other fair island with pure water.<br>Thou ranger of the skies, thou must have seen many fair regions while<br>coursing (through the air).' Garuda, alter reflecting for a few moments,<br>asked his mother Vinata, saying, 'Why, mother, have I to do the bidding<br>of the snakes?' Vinata thus questioned by him spake unto that ranger of<br>the skies, her son, invested with every virtue, of great energy, and<br>great strength, as follows: "Vinata said, 'O thou best of birds, I have<br>become, from misfortune, the slave of my co-wife. The snakes, by an act<br>of deception, caused me to lose my bet and have made me so.' When his<br>mother had told him the reason, that ranger of the skies, dejected with<br>grief, addressed the snakes, saying, 'Tell me, ye snakes, by bringing<br>what thing, gaining a knowledge of what thing, or doing what act of<br>prowess, we may be freed from this state of bondage to you.'" Sauti<br>continued, 'The snakes, hearing him, said, 'Bring thou amrita by force.<br>Then O bird, shall you be freed from bondage.'" And so ends the<br>twenty-seventh section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.
