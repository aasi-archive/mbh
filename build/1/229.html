                            (Khandava-daha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then Vibhatsu, the son of Pandu, invoking his<br>excellent weapons, prevented that shower of rain by Indra, by means of a<br>shower of his own weapons. And Arjuna of immeasurable soul soon covered<br>the forest of Khandava with innumerable arrows like the moon covering the<br>atmosphere with a thick fog. When the sky above that forest was thus<br>covered with the arrows of Arjuna no living creature could then escape<br>from below. And it so happened that while that forest was burning,<br>Takshaka, the chief of the Nagas, was not there, having gone at that time<br>to the field of Kurukshetra. But Aswasena, the mighty son of Takshaka,<br>was there. He made great efforts to escape from that fire; but confined<br>by Arjuna's shafts he succeeded not in finding a way. It was then that<br>his mother, the daughter of a snake, determined to save him by swallowing<br>him first. His mother first swallowed his head and then was swallowing<br>his tail. And desirous of saving her son, the sea-snake rose (up from the<br>earth) while still employed in swallowing her son's tail. But Arjuna as<br>soon as he beheld her escaping, severed her head from her body by means<br>of a sharp and keen-edged arrow. Indra saw all this, and desiring to save<br>his friend's son, the wielder of the thunderbolt, by raising a violent<br>wind, deprived Arjuna of consciousness. During those few moments,<br>Aswasena succeeded in effecting his escape. Beholding that manifestation<br>of the power of illusion, and deceived by that snake, Arjuna was much<br>enraged. He forthwith cut every animal seeking to escape by the skies,<br>into two, three, or more pieces. And Vibhatsu in anger, and Agni, and<br>Vasudeva also, cursed the snake that had escaped so deceitfully, saying,<br>'Never shalt thou be famous!' And Jishnu remembering the deception<br>practised upon him, became angry, and covering the firmament with a cloud<br>of arrows, sought to fight with him of a thousand eyes. The chief of the<br>celestials also, seeing Arjuna in anger, sought to fight with him, and<br>hurled his own fierce weapons, covering the wide expanse of the<br>firmament. Then the winds, making a loud roar and agitating all the<br>oceans, brought together masses of clouds in the sky, charged with<br>torrents of rain. Those masses of clouds began to vomit thunder and<br>terrible flashes of lightning charged with the thunderclap. Then Arjuna<br>possessing a knowledge of means, hurled the excellent weapon called<br>Vayavya with proper mantras to dispel those clouds. With that weapon the<br>energy and force of Indra's thunderbolt and of those clouds were<br>destroyed. And the torrents of rain with which those clouds were charged<br>were all dried up, and the lightning that played amongst them was also<br>destroyed. Within a moment the sky was cleared of dust and darkness, and<br>a delicious, cool breeze began to blow and the disc of the sun resumed<br>its normal state. Then the eater of clarified butter (Agni), glad because<br>none could baffle him, assumed various forms, and sprinkled over with the<br>fat exuded by the bodies of creatures, blazed forth with all his flames,<br>filling the universe with his roar. Then numerous birds of the Garuda<br>tribe bearing excellent feathers, beholding that the forest was protected<br>by Krishna and Arjuna, descended filled with pride, from the upper skies,<br>desirous of striking those heroes with their thunderlike wings, beaks and<br>claws. Innumerable Nagas also, with faces emitting fire descending from<br>high, approached Arjuna, vomiting the most virulent poison all the while.<br>Beholding them approach, Arjuna cut them into pieces by means of arrows<br>steeped in the fire of his own wrath. Then those birds and snakes,<br>deprived of life, fell into the burning element below. And there came<br>also, desirous of battle, innumerable Asuras with Gandharvas and Yakshas<br>and Rakshasas and Nagas sending forth terrific yells. Armed with machines<br>vomiting from their throats (mouths?) iron balls and bullets, and<br>catapults for propelling huge stones, and rockets, they approached to<br>strike Krishna and Partha, their energy and strength increased by wrath.<br>But though they rained a perfect shower of weapons, Vibhatsu, addressing<br>them reproachfully, struck off their heads with his own sharp arrows.<br>That slayer of foes, Krishna, also, endued with great energy, made a<br>great slaughter of the Daitya and the Danava with his discus. Many Asuras<br>of immeasurable might, pierced with Krishna's arrows and smitten with the<br>force of his discus, became motionless like waifs and strays stranded on<br>the bank by the violence of the waves. Then Sakra the lord of the<br>celestials, riding on his white elephant, rushed at those heroes, and<br>taking up his thunderbolt which could never go in vain, hurled it with<br>great force. And the slayer of Asuras said unto the gods, 'These two are<br>slain.' Beholding the fierce thunderbolt about to be hurled by their<br>chief, the celestials all took up their respective weapons. Yama, O king,<br>took up the death-dealing mace, and Kuvera his spiked club, and Varuna<br>his noose and beautiful missile. And Skanda (Kartikeya) took up his long<br>lance and stood motionless like the mountain of Meru. The Aswins stood<br>there with resplendent plants in their hands. Dhatri stood, bow in hand,<br>and Jaya with a thick club. Tvashtri of great strength took up in wrath,<br>a huge mountain and Surya stood with a bright dart, and Mrityu with a<br>battle-axe. Aryaman stalked about with a terrible bludgeon furnished with<br>sharp spikes, and Mitra stood there with a discus sharp as a razor. And,<br>O monarch, Pusha and Bhaga and Savitri, in wrath, rushed at Krishna and<br>Partha with bows and scimitars in hand. And Rudras and the Vasus, the<br>mighty Maruts and the Viswedevas and the Sadhyas, all resplendent with<br>their own energy,&#8212;these and many other celestials, armed with various<br>weapons rushed against those exalted of men, Krishna and Partha, for<br>smiting them down. Then were seen in that great conflict wonderful<br>portents all around robbing every creature of his sense, and resembling<br>those that appeared at the time of the universal dissolution. But Arjuna<br>and Krishna, fearless and invincible in battle, beholding Sakra and the<br>other celestials prepared for fight, calmly waited, bows in hands.<br>Skilled in battle, those heroes in wrath assailed the advancing host of<br>celestials with their own thunderlike arrows. The celestials repeatedly<br>routed by Krishna and Arjuna, at last left the field of battle for fear<br>and sought the protection of Indra. The Munis who were witnessing the<br>battle from the skies, beholding the celestials defeated by Madhava and<br>Arjuna, were filled with wonder. Sakra also repeatedly witnessing their<br>prowess in battle, became exceedingly gratified, and once more rushed to<br>the assault. The chastiser of Paka then caused a heavy shower of stones,<br>desiring to ascertain the prowess of Arjuna who was able to draw the bow<br>even with his left hand. Arjuna, in great wrath, dispelled with his<br>arrows that thick shower. Then he of a hundred sacrifices beholding that<br>shower baffled, once more caused a thicker shower of stones. But the son<br>of the chastiser of Paka (viz., Arjuna) gratified his father by baffling<br>that shower also with his swift arrows. Then Sakra, desirous of smiting<br>down the son of Pandu, tore up with his hands a large peak from Mandara,<br>with tall trees on it, and hurled it against him. But Arjuna divided that<br>mountain-peak into a thousand pieces by his swift-going and fire-mouthed<br>arrows. The fragments of that mountain, in falling through the skies,<br>looked as if the sun and the moon and the planets, displaced from their<br>positions fell down on earth. That huge peak fell down upon that forest<br>and by its fall killed numerous living creatures that dwelt in Khandava.'"
