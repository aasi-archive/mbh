                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Upon the Kuru king and Bhima, the foremost of<br>all endued with strength, having entered the arena, the spectators were<br>divided into two parties in consequence of the partiality swaying their<br>affections. Some cried, 'Behold the heroic king of the<br>Kurus!'&#8212;some&#8212;'Behold Bhima!'&#8212;And on account of these cries, there was,<br>all on a sudden, a loud uproar. And seeing the place become like a<br>troubled ocean, the intelligent Bharadwaja said unto his dear son,<br>Aswatthaman, 'Restrain both these mighty warriors so proficient in arms.<br>Let not the ire of the assembly be provoked by this combat of Bhima and<br>Duryodhana.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then the son of the preceptor of the princes<br>restrained those combatants with their maces uplifted and resembling two<br>swollen oceans agitated by the winds that blow at the universal<br>dissolution. And Drona himself entering the yard of the arena commanded<br>the musicians to stop, and with a voice deep as that of the clouds<br>addressed these words, 'Behold ye now that Partha who is dearer to me<br>than my own son, the master of all arms, the son of Indra himself, and<br>like unto the younger brother of Indra, (Vishnu)! And having performed<br>the propitiatory rites, the youthful Phalguna, equipped with the finger<br>protector (gauntlet) and his quiver full of shafts and bow in hand,<br>donning his golden mail, appeared in the lists even like an evening cloud<br>reflecting the rays of the setting sun and illumined by the hues of the<br>rainbow and flashes of lightning.<br><br>"On seeing Arjuna, the whole assembly were delighted and conchs began to<br>be blown all around with other musical instruments. And there arose a<br>great uproar in consequence of the spectators' exclaiming,&#8212;'This is the<br>graceful son of Kunti!'&#8212;'This is the middle (third) Pandava!'&#8212;'This is<br>the son of the mighty Indra!'&#8212;'This is the protector of the<br>Kurus'&#8212;'This is the foremost of those versed in arms!'&#8212;'This is the<br>foremost of all cherishers of virtue!'&#8212;'This is the foremost of the<br>persons of correct behaviour, the great repository of the knowledge of<br>manners!' At those exclamations, the tears of Kunti, mixing with the milk<br>of her breast, wetted her bosom. And his ears being filled with that<br>uproar, that first of men, Dhritarashtra, asked Vidura in delight, 'O<br>Kshatri, what is this great uproar for, like unto that of the troubled<br>ocean, arising all on a sudden and rending the very heavens?' Vidura<br>replied, 'O mighty monarch, the son of Pandu and Pritha, Phalguna, clad<br>in mail hath entered the lists. And hence this uproar!' Dhritarashtra<br>said, 'O thou of soul so great, by the three fires sprung from Pritha who<br>is even like the sacred fuel, I have, indeed, been blessed, favoured and<br>protected!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'When the spectators, excited with delight, had<br>somewhat regained their equanimity, Vibhatsu began to display his<br>lightness in the use of weapons. By the Agneya weapon, he created fire,<br>and by the Varuna weapon he created water, by the Vayavya weapon, he<br>created air, and by the Parjanya weapon he created clouds. And by the<br>Bhauma weapon, he created land, and by the Parvatya weapon, he brought<br>mountains into being. By the Antardhana weapon all these were made to<br>disappear. Now the beloved one of his preceptor (Arjuna) appeared tall<br>and now short; now he was seen on the yoke of his car, and now on the car<br>itself; and the next moment he was on the ground. And the hero favoured<br>by his practised dexterity, hit with his various butts&#8212;some tender, some<br>fine and some of thick composition. And like one shaft, he let fly at a<br>time into the mouth of a moving iron-boar five shafts together from his<br>bow-string. And that hero of mighty energy discharged one and twenty<br>arrows into the hollow of a cow's horn hung up on a rope swaying to and<br>fro. In this manner, O sinless one, Arjuna showed his profound skill in<br>the use of sword, bow, and mace, walking over the lists in circles.<br><br>"And, O Bharata, when the exhibition had well-nigh ended, the excitement<br>of the spectators had cooled, and the sounds of instruments had died out<br>there was heard proceeding from the gate, the slapping of arms,<br>betokening might and strength, and even like unto the roar of the<br>thunder. And, O king, as soon as this sound was heard, the assembled<br>multitude instantly thought, 'Are the mountains splitting or is the earth<br>itself rending asunder, or is the welkin resounding with the roar of<br>gathering clouds? And then all the spectators turned their eyes towards<br>the gate. And Drona stood, surrounded by the five brothers, the sons of<br>Pritha, and looked like the moon in conjunction with the five-starred<br>constellation Hasta. And Duryodhana, that slayer of foes, stood up in<br>haste and was surrounded by his century of haughty brothers with<br>Aswatthaman amongst them. And that prince, mace in hand, thus surrounded<br>by his hundred brothers with uplifted weapons appeared like Purandara in<br>days of yore, encircled by the celestial host on the occasion of the<br>battle with the Danavas.'"
