                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Ashtaka said, 'Those cognisant of the Vedas differ in opinion as to how<br>the followers of each of the four modes of life, viz., Grihasthas,<br>Bhikshus, Brahmacharins, and Vanaprashthas, should conduct themselves in<br>order to acquire religious merit."<br><br>"Yayati answered, 'These are what a Brahmacharin must do. While dwelling<br>in the abode of his preceptor, he must receive lessons only when his<br>preceptor summons him to do so; he must attend to the service of his<br>preceptor without waiting for the latter's command; he must rise from his<br>bed before his preceptor riseth, and go to bed after his preceptor hath<br>gone to bed. He must be humble, must have his passions under complete<br>control, must be patient, vigilant, and devoted to studies. It is then<br>only that he can achieve success. It hath been said in the oldest<br>Upanishad that a grihastha, acquiring wealth by honest means, should<br>perform sacrifices; he should always give something in charity, should<br>perform the rites of hospitality unto all arriving at his abode, and<br>should never use anything without giving a portion thereof to others. A<br>Muni, without search for woods, depending on his own vigour, should<br>abstain from all vicious acts, should give away something in charity,<br>should never inflict pain on any creature. It is then only that he can<br>achieve success. He, indeed, is a true Bhikshu who doth not support<br>himself by any manual arts, who possesseth numerous accomplishments, who<br>hath his passions under complete control, who is unconnected with worldly<br>concerns, who sleepeth not under the shelter of a householder's roof, who<br>is without wife, and who going a little way every day, travelleth over a<br>large extent of the country. A learned man should adopt the Vanaprastha<br>mode of life after performance of the necessary rites, when he hath been<br>able to control his appetites for enjoyment and desire of acquiring<br>valuable possessions. When one dieth in the woods while leading the<br>Vanaprastha mode of life, he maketh his ancestors and the successors,<br>numbering ten generations including himself, mix with the Divine essence.'<br><br>"Ashtaka asked, 'How many kinds of Munis are there (observers of the vow<br>of the silence)?'<br><br>"Yayati answered, 'He is, indeed, a Muni who, though dwelling in the<br>woods, hath an inhabited place near, or who, though dwelling in an<br>inhabited place, hath the woods near.'<br><br>"Ashtaka enquired what is meant by Muni.' Yayati replied, 'A Muni<br>withdrawing himself from all worldly objects liveth in the woods. And<br>though he might never seek to surround himself with those objects that<br>are procurable in an inhabited place, he might yet obtain them all by<br>virtue of his ascetic power. He may truly be said to dwell in the woods<br>having an inhabited place near to himself. Again a wise man withdrawn<br>from all earthly objects, might live in a hamlet leading the life of a<br>hermit. He may never exhibit the pride of family, birth or learning. Clad<br>in the scantiest robes, he may yet regard himself as attired in the<br>richest vestments. He may rest content with food just enough for the<br>support of life. Such a person, though dwelling in an inhabited place,<br>liveth yet in the woods.<br><br>"The person again, who, with passions under complete control, adopteth<br>the vow of silence, refraining from action and entertaining no desire,<br>achieveth success. Why shouldst thou not, indeed, reverence the man who<br>liveth on clean food, who refraineth from ever injuring others, whose<br>heart is ever pure, who stands in the splendour of ascetic attributes,<br>who is free from the leaden weight of desire, who abstaineth from injury<br>even when sanctioned by religion? Emaciated by austerities and reduced in<br>flesh, marrow and blood, such a one conquereth not only this but the<br>highest world. And when the Muni sits in yoga meditation, becoming<br>indifferent to happiness and misery, honour and insult, he then leaveth<br>the world and enjoyeth communion with Brahma. When the Muni taketh food<br>like wine and other animals, i. e., without providing for it beforehand<br>and without any relish (like a sleeping infant feeding on the mother's<br>lap), then like the all-pervading spirit he becometh identified with the<br>whole universe and attaineth to salvation.'"
