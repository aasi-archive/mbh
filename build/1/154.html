                            (Hidimva-vadha Parva)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Not far from the place where the Pandavas were<br>asleep, a Rakshasa by name Hidimva dwelt on the Sala tree. Possessed of<br>great energy and prowess, he was a cruel cannibal of visage that was grim<br>in consequence of his sharp and long teeth. He was now hungry and longing<br>for human flesh. Of long shanks and a large belly, his locks and beard<br>were both red in hue. His shoulders were broad like the neck of a tree;<br>his ears were like unto arrows, and his features were frightful. Of red<br>eyes and grim visage, the monster beheld, while casting his glances<br>around, the sons of Pandu sleeping in those woods. He was then hungry and<br>longing for human flesh. Shaking his dry and grizzly locks and scratching<br>them with his fingers pointed upwards, the large-mouthed cannibal<br>repeatedly looked at the sleeping sons of Pandu yawning wistfully at<br>times. Of huge body and great strength, of complexion like the colour of<br>a mass of clouds, of teeth long and sharp-pointed and face emitting a<br>sort of lustre, he was ever pleased with human flesh. And scenting the<br>odour of man, he addressed his sister, saying, 'O sister, it is after a<br>long time that such agreeable food hath approached me! My mouth waters at<br>the anticipated relish of such food. My eight teeth, so sharp-pointed and<br>incapable of being resisted by any substance, I shall, today, after a<br>long time, put into the most delicious flesh. Attacking the human throat<br>and even opening the veins, I shall (today) drink a plentiful quantity of<br>human blood, hot and fresh and frothy. Go and ascertain who these are,<br>lying asleep in these woods. The strong scent of man pleaseth my<br>nostrils. Slaughtering all these men, bring them unto me. They sleep<br>within my territory. Thou needest have no fear from them. Do my bidding<br>soon, for we shall then together eat their flesh, tearing off their<br>bodies at pleasure. And after feasting to our fill on human flesh we<br>shall then dance together to various measures!'<br><br>"Thus addressed by Hidimva in those woods, Hidimva, the female cannibal,<br>at the command of her brother, went, O bull of Bharata's race, to the<br>spot where the Pandavas were. And on going there, she beheld the Pandavas<br>asleep with their mother and the invincible Bhimasena sitting awake. And<br>beholding Bhimasena unrivalled on earth for beauty and like unto a<br>vigorous Sala tree, the Rakshasa woman immediately fell in love with him,<br>and she said to herself, 'This person of hue like heated gold and of<br>mighty arms, of broad shoulders as the lion, and so resplendent, of neck<br>marked with three lines like a conch-shell and eyes like lotus-petals, is<br>worthy of being my husband. I shall not obey the cruel mandate of my<br>brother. A woman's love for her husband is stronger than her affection<br>for her brother. If I slay him, my brother's gratification as well as<br>mine will only be momentary. But if I slay him not, I can enjoy, with him<br>for ever and ever.' Thus saying, the Rakshasa woman, capable of assuming<br>form at will, assumed an excellent human form and began to advance with<br>slow steps towards Bhima of mighty arms. Decked with celestial ornaments<br>she advanced with smiles on her lips and a modest gait, and addressing<br>Bhima said, 'O bull among men, whence hast thou come here and who art<br>thou? Who, besides, are these persons of celestial beauty sleeping here?<br>Who also, O sinless one, is this lady of transcendent beauty sleeping so<br>trustfully in these woods as if she were lying in her own chamber? Dost<br>thou not know that this forest is the abode of a Rakshasa. Truly do I<br>say, here liveth the wicked Rakshasa called Hidimva. Ye beings of<br>celestial beauty, I have been sent hither even by that Rakshasa&#8212;my<br>brother&#8212;with the cruel intent of killing you for his food. But I tell<br>thee truly that beholding thee resplendent as a celestial, I would have<br>none else for my husband save thee! Thou who art acquainted with all<br>duties, knowing this, do unto me what is proper. My heart as well as my<br>body hath been pierced by (the shafts of) Kama (Cupid). O, as I am<br>desirous of obtaining thee, make me thine. O thou of mighty arms, I will<br>rescue thee from the Rakshasa who eateth human flesh. O sinless one, be<br>thou my husband. We shall then live on the breasts of mountains<br>inaccessible to ordinary mortals. I can range the air and I do so at<br>pleasure. Thou mayest enjoy great felicity with me in those regions.'<br><br>"Hearing these words of hers, Bhima replied, 'O Rakshasa woman, who can,<br>like a Muni having all his passions under control, abandon his sleeping<br>mother and elder and younger brothers? What man like me would go to<br>gratify his lust, leaving his sleeping mother and brothers as food for a<br>Rakshasa?'<br><br>"The Rakshasa woman replied, 'O, awaken all these, I shall do unto you<br>all that is agreeable to thee! I shall certainly rescue you all from my<br>cannibal brother?'<br><br>"Bhima then said, 'O Rakshasa woman, I will not, from fear of thy wicked<br>brother, awaken my brothers and mother sleeping comfortably in the woods.<br>O timid one, Rakshasas are never able to bear the prowess of my arms.<br>And, O thou of handsome eyes, neither men, nor Gandharvas, nor Yakshas<br>are able to bear my might. O amiable one, thou mayst stay or go as thou<br>likest, or mayst even send thy cannibal brother, O thou of delicate<br>shape. I care not.'"
