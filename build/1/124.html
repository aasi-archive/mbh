                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'After the birth of Kunti's sons and also of the<br>hundred sons of Dhritarashtra the daughter of the king of the Madras<br>privately addressed Pandu, saying, 'O slayer of foes, I have no complaint<br>even if thou beest unpropitious to me. I have, O sinless one, also no<br>complaint that though by birth I am superior to Kunti yet I am inferior<br>to her in station. I do not grieve, O thou of Kuru's race, that Gandhari<br>hath obtained a hundred sons. This, however, is my great grief that while<br>Kunti and I are equal, I should be childless, while it should so chance<br>that thou shouldst have offspring by Kunti alone. If the daughter of<br>Kuntibhoja should so provide that I should have offspring, she would then<br>be really doing me a great favour and benefiting thee likewise. She being<br>my rival, I feel a delicacy in soliciting any favour of her. If thou<br>beest, O king, propitiously disposed to me, then ask her to grant my<br>desire.'<br><br>"Hearing her, Pandu replied, 'O Madri, I do revolve this matter often in<br>my own mind, but I have hitherto hesitated to tell thee anything, not<br>knowing how thou wouldst receive it. Now that I know what your wishes<br>are, I shall certainly strive after that end. I think that, asked by me,<br>Kunti will not refuse.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'After this, Pandu addressed Kunti in private,<br>saying, 'O Kunti, grant me some more offspring for the expansion of my<br>race and for the benefit of the world. O blessed one, provide thou that I<br>myself, my ancestors, and thine also, may always have the funeral cake<br>offered to us. O, do what is beneficial to me, and grant me and the world<br>what, indeed, is the best of benefits. O, do what, indeed, may be<br>difficult for thee, moved by the desire of achieving undying fame.<br>Behold, Indra, even though he hath obtained the sovereignty of the<br>celestials, doth yet, for fame alone, perform sacrifices. O handsome one,<br>Brahmanas, well-acquainted with the Vedas, and having achieved high<br>ascetic merit, do yet, for fame alone, approach their spiritual masters<br>with reverence. So also all royal sages and Brahmanas possessed of<br>ascetic wealth have achieved, for fame only, the most difficult of<br>ascetic feat. Therefore, O blameless one, rescue this Madri as by a raft<br>(by granting her the means of obtaining offspring), and achieve thou<br>imperishable fame by making her a mother of children.'<br><br>"Thus addressed by her lord, Kunti readily yielded, and said unto Madri,<br>'Think thou, without loss of time, of some celestial, and thou shall<br>certainly obtain from him a child like unto him.' Reflecting for a few<br>moments. Madri thought of the twin Aswins, who coming unto her with speed<br>begat upon her two sons that were twins named Nakula and Sahadeva,<br>unrivalled on earth for personal beauty. And as soon as they were born,<br>an incorporeal voice said, 'In energy and beauty these twins shall<br>transcend even the twin Aswins themselves.' Indeed possessed of great<br>energy and beauty, they illumined the whole region.<br><br>"O king, after all the children were born the Rishis dwelling on the<br>mountain of a hundred peaks uttering blessings on them and affectionately<br>performing the first rites of birth, bestowed appellations on them. The<br>eldest of Kunti's children was called Yudhishthira, the second Bhimasena,<br>and the third Arjuna, and of Madri's sons, the first-born of the twins<br>was called Nakula and the next Sahadeva. And those foremost sons born at<br>an interval of one year after one another, looked like an embodied period<br>of five years. And king Pandu, beholding his children of celestial beauty<br>and of super-abundant energy, great strength and prowess, and of<br>largeness of soul, rejoiced exceedingly. And the children became great<br>favourites of the Rishis, as also of their wives, dwelling on the<br>mountain of a hundred peaks.<br><br>"Some time after, Pandu again requested Kunti on behalf of Madri.<br>Addressed, O king, by her lord in private, Kunti replied, 'Having given<br>her the formula of invocation only once, she hath, O king, managed to<br>obtain two sons. Have I not been thus deceived by her, I fear, O king,<br>that she will soon surpass me in the number of her children. This,<br>indeed, is the way of all wicked women. Fool that I was, I did not know<br>that by invoking the twin gods I could obtain at one birth twin children.<br>I beseech thee, O king, do not command me any further. Let this be the<br>boon granted (by thee) to me.'<br><br>"Thus, O king, were born unto Pandu five sons who were begotten by<br>celestials and were endued with great strength, and who all lived to<br>achieve great fame and expand the Kuru race. Each bearing every<br>auspicious mark on his person, handsome like Soma, proud as the lion,<br>well-skilled in the use of the bow, and of leonine tread, breast, heart,<br>eyes, neck and prowess, those foremost of men, resembling the celestials<br>themselves in might, began to grow up. And beholding them and their<br>virtues growing with years, the great Rishis dwelling on that snowcapped<br>sacred mountain were filled with wonder. And the five Pandavas and the<br>hundred sons of Dhritarashtra&#8212;that propagator of the Kuru race&#8212;grew up<br>rapidly like a cluster of lotuses in a lake.'"
