                            (Chaitraratha Parva continued)<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'Beholding his asylum bereft of his children,<br>the Muni afflicted with great grief left it again. And in course of his<br>wandering he saw, O Partha, a river swollen with the waters of the rainy<br>season, sweeping away numberless trees and plants that had grown on its<br>margin. Beholding this, O thou of Kuru's race, the distressed Muni<br>thinking that he would certainly be drowned if he fell into the waters of<br>that river, he tied himself strongly with several cords and flung<br>himself, under the influence of grief, into the current of that mighty<br>stream. But, O slayer of foes, that stream soon cut those cords and cast<br>the Rishi ashore. And the Rishi rose from the bank, freed from the cords<br>with which he had tied himself. And because his cords were thus broken<br>off by the violence of the current, the Rishi called the stream by the<br>name of Vipasa (the cord-breaker). For his grief the Muni could not, from<br>that time, stay in one place; he began to wander over mountains and along<br>rivers and lakes. And beholding once again a river named Haimavati<br>(flowing from Himavat) of terrible aspect and full of fierce crocodiles<br>and other (aquatic) monsters, the Rishi threw himself into it, but the<br>river mistaking the Brahmana for a mass of (unquenchable) fire,<br>immediately flew in a hundred different directions, and hath been known<br>ever since by the name of the Satadru (the river of a hundred courses).<br>Seeing himself on the dry land even there he exclaimed, 'O, I cannot die<br>by my own hands!' Saying this, the Rishi once more bent his steps towards<br>his asylum. Crossing numberless mountains and countries, as he was about<br>to re-enter his asylum, he was followed by his daughter-in-law named<br>Adrisyanti. As she neared him, he heard the sound from behind of a very<br>intelligent recitation of the Vedas with the six graces of elocution.<br>Hearing that sound, the Rishi asked, 'Who is it that followeth me?' His<br>daughter-in-law then answered, 'I am Adrisyanti, the wife of Saktri. I am<br>helpless, though devoted to asceticism.' Hearing her, Vasishtha said, 'O<br>daughter, whose is this voice that I heard, repeating the Vedas along<br>with the Angas like unto the voice of Saktri reciting the Vedas with the<br>Angas?' Adrisyanti answered, 'I bear in my womb a child by thy son<br>Saktri. He hath been here full twelve years. The voice thou hearest is<br>that of the Muni, who is reciting the Vedas.'<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'Thus addressed by her the illustrious<br>Vasishtha became exceedingly glad. And saying, 'O, there is a child (of<br>my race)!'&#8212;he refrained, O Partha, from self-destruction. The sinless<br>one accompanied by his daughter-in-law, then returned to his asylum. And<br>the Rishi saw one day in the solitary woods (the Rakshasa) Kalmashapada.<br>The king, O Bharata, possessed by fierce Rakshasa, as he saw the Rishi,<br>became filled with wrath and rose up, desiring to devour him. And<br>Adrisyanti beholding before her that the Rakshasa of cruel deeds,<br>addressed Vasishtha in these words, full of anxiety and fear, 'O<br>illustrious one, the cruel Rakshasa, like unto Death himself armed with<br>(his) fierce club, cometh towards us with a wooden club in hand! There is<br>none else on earth, except thee, O illustrious one, and, O foremost of<br>all that are conversant with the Vedas to restrain him today. Protect me,<br>O illustrious one, from this cruel wretch of terrible mien. Surely, the<br>Rakshasa cometh hither to devour us' Vasishtha, hearing this, said, 'Fear<br>not, O daughter, there is no need of any fear from any Rakshasa. This one<br>is no Rakshasa from whom thou apprehendest such imminent danger. This is<br>king Kalmashapada endued with great energy and celebrated on earth. That<br>terrible man dwelleth in these woods.'<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'Beholding him advancing, the illustrious Rishi<br>Vasishtha, endued with great energy, restrained him, O Bharata, by<br>uttering the sound Hum. Sprinkling him again with water sanctified with<br>incantations the Rishi freed the monarch from that terrible curse. For<br>twelve years the monarch had been overwhelmed by the energy of<br>Vasishtha's son like Surya seized by the planet (Rahu) during the season<br>of an eclipse. Freed from the Rakshasa the monarch illumined that large<br>forest by his splendour like the sun illumining the evening clouds.<br>Recovering his power of reason, the king saluted that best of Rishis with<br>joined palms and said, 'O illustrious one, I am the son of Sudasa and thy<br>disciple, O best of Munis! O, tell me what is thy pleasure and what I am<br>to do.' Vasishtha replied, saying, 'My desire hath already been<br>accomplished. Return now to thy kingdom and rule thy subjects. And, O<br>chief of men, never insult Brahmanas any more.' The monarch replied, 'O<br>illustrious one, I shall never more insult superior Brahmanas. In<br>obedience to thy command I shall always worship Brahmanas. But, O best of<br>Brahmanas, I desire to obtain from thee that by which, O foremost of all<br>that are conversant with the Vedas, I may be freed from the debt I owe to<br>the race of Ikshvaku! O best of men, it behoveth thee to grant me, for<br>the perpetuation of Ikshvaku's race, a desirable son possessing beauty<br>and accomplishments and good behaviour.'<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'Thus addressed, Vasishtha, that best of<br>Brahmanas devoted to truth replied unto that mighty bowman of a monarch,<br>saying, 'I will give you.' After some time, O prince of men, Vasishtha,<br>accompanied by the monarch, went to the latter's capital known all over<br>the earth by the name of Ayodhya. The citizens in great joy came out to<br>receive the sinless and illustrious one, like the dwellers in heaven<br>coming out to receive their chief. The monarch, accompanied by Vasishtha,<br>re-entered his auspicious capital after a long time. The citizens of<br>Ayodhya beheld their king accompanied by his priest, as if he were the<br>rising sun. The monarch who was superior to everyone in beauty filled by<br>his splendour the whole town of Ayodhya, like the autumnal moon filling<br>by his splendour the whole firmament. And the excellent city itself, in<br>consequence of its streets having been watered and swept, and of the rows<br>of banners and pendants beautifying it all around, gladdened the<br>monarch's heart. And, O prince of Kuru's race, the city filled as it was<br>with joyous and healthy souls, in consequence of his presence, looked gay<br>like Amaravati with the presence of the chief of the celestials. After<br>the royal sage had entered his capital, the queen, at the king's command,<br>approached Vasishtha. The great Rishi, making a covenant with her, united<br>himself with her according to the high ordinance. And after a little<br>while, when the queen conceived, that best of Rishis, receiving the<br>reverential salutations of the king, went back to his asylum. The queen<br>bore the embryo in her womb for a long time. When she saw that she did<br>not bring forth anything, she tore open her womb by a piece of stone. It<br>was then that at the twelfth year (of the conception) was born Asmaka,<br>that bull amongst men, that royal sage who founded (the city of)<br>Paudanya.'"
