                            (Paushya Parva)<br><br>Sauti said, "Janamejaya, the son of Parikshit, was, with his brothers,<br>attending his long sacrifice on the plains of Kurukshetra. His brothers<br>were three, Srutasena, Ugrasena, and Bhimasena. And as they were sitting<br>at the sacrifice, there arrived at the spot an offspring of Sarama (the<br>celestial bitch). And belaboured by the brothers of Janamejaya, he ran<br>away to his mother, crying in pain. And his mother seeing him crying<br>exceedingly asked him, 'Why criest thou so? Who hath beaten thee? And<br>being thus questioned, he said unto his mother, 'I have been belaboured<br>by the brothers of Janamejaya.' And his mother replied, 'Thou hast<br>committed some fault for which hast thou been beaten!' He answered, 'I<br>have not committed any fault. I have not touched the sacrificial butter<br>with my tongue, nor have I even cast a look upon it.' His mother Sarama<br>hearing this and much distressed at the affliction of her son went to the<br>place where Janamejaya with his brothers was at his long-extending<br>sacrifice. And she addressed Janamejaya in anger, saying, 'This my son<br>hath committed no fault: he hath not looked upon your sacrificial butter,<br>nor hath he touched it with his tongue. Wherefore hath he been beaten?'<br>They said not a word in reply; whereupon she said, 'As ye have beaten my<br>son who hath committed no fault, therefore shall evil come upon ye, when<br>ye least expect it.'<br><br>"Janamejaya, thus addressed by the celestial bitch, Sarama, became<br>exceedingly alarmed and dejected. And after the sacrifice was concluded<br>returned to Hastinapura, and began to take great pains in searching for a<br>Purohita who could by procuring absolution for his sin, neutralise the<br>effect of the curse.<br><br>"One day Janamejaya, the son of Parikshit, while a-hunting, observed in a<br>particular part of his dominions a hermitage where dwelt a certain Rishi<br>of fame, Srutasrava. He had a son named Somasrava deeply engaged in<br>ascetic devotions. Being desirous of appointing that son of the Rishi as<br>his Purohita, Janamejaya, the son of Parikshit, saluted the Rishi and<br>addressed him, saying, 'O possessor of the six attributes, let this thy<br>son be my purohita.' The Rishi thus addressed, answered Janamejaya, 'O<br>Janamejaya, this my son, deep in ascetic devotions, accomplished in the<br>study of the Vedas, and endued with the full force of my asceticism, is<br>born of (the womb of) a she-snake that had drunk my vital fluid. He is<br>able to absolve thee from all offences save those committed against<br>Mahadeva. But he hath one particular habit, viz. he would grant to any<br>Brahmana whatever might be begged of him. If thou canst put up with it,<br>then thou take him.' Janamejaya thus addressed replied to the Rishi, 'It<br>shall be even so.' And accepting him for his Purohita, he returned to his<br>capital; and he then addressed his brothers saying, 'This is the person I<br>have chosen for my spiritual master; whatsoever he may say must be<br>complied with by you without examination.' And his brothers did as they<br>were directed. And giving these directions to his brothers, the king<br>marched towards Takshyashila and brought that country under his authority.<br><br>"About this time there was a Rishi, Ayoda-Dhaumya by name. And<br>Ayoda-Dhaumya had three disciples, Upamanyu, Aruni, and Veda. And the<br>Rishi bade one of these disciples, Aruni of Panchala, to go and stop up a<br>breach in the water-course of a certain field. And Aruni of Panchala,<br>thus ordered by his preceptor, repaired to the spot. And having gone<br>there he saw that he could not stop up the breach in the water-course by<br>ordinary means. And he was distressed because he could not do his<br>preceptor's bidding. But at length he saw a way and said, 'Well, I will<br>do it in this way.' He then went down into the breach and lay down<br>himself there. And the water was thus confined.<br><br>"And some time after, the preceptor Ayoda-Dhaumya asked his other<br>disciples where Aruni of Panchala was. And they answered, 'Sir, he hath<br>been sent by yourself saying, 'Go, stop up the breach in the water-course<br>of the field,' Thus reminded, Dhaumya, addressing his pupils, said, 'Then<br>let us all go to the place where he is.'<br><br>"And having arrived there, he shouted, 'Ho Aruni of Panchala! Where art<br>thou? Come hither, my child.' And Aruni hearing the voice of his<br>preceptor speedily came out of the water-course and stood before his<br>preceptor. And addressing the latter, Aruni said, 'Here I am in the<br>breach of the water-course. Not having been able to devise any other<br>means, I entered myself for the purpose of preventing the water running<br>out. It is only upon hearing thy voice that, having left it and allowed<br>the waters to escape, I have stood before thee. I salute thee, Master;<br>tell me what I have to do.'<br><br>"The preceptor, thus addressed, replied, 'Because in getting up from the<br>ditch thou hast opened the water-course, thenceforth shalt thou be called<br>Uddalaka as a mark of thy preceptor's favour. And because my words have<br>been obeyed by thee, thou shalt obtain good fortune. And all the Vedas<br>shall shine in thee and all the Dharmasastras also.' And Aruni, thus<br>addressed by his preceptor, went to the country after his heart.<br><br>"The name of another of Ayoda-Dhaumya's disciples was Upamanyu. And<br>Dhaumya appointed him saying, 'Go, my child, Upamanyu, look after the<br>kine.' And according to his preceptor's orders, he went to tend the kine.<br>And having watched them all day, he returned in the evening to his<br>preceptor's house and standing before him he saluted him respectfully.<br>And his preceptor seeing him in good condition of body asked him,<br>'Upamanyu, my child, upon what dost thou support thyself? Thou art<br>exceedingly plump.' And he answered, 'Sir, I support myself by begging'.<br>And his preceptor said, 'What is obtained in alms should not be used by<br>thee without offering it to me.' And Upamanyu, thus told, went away. And<br>having obtained alms, he offered the same to his preceptor. And his<br>preceptor took from him even the whole. And Upamanyu, thus treated, went<br>to attend the cattle. And having watched them all day, he returned in the<br>evening to his preceptor's abode. And he stood before his preceptor and<br>saluted him with respect. And his preceptor perceiving that he still<br>continued to be of good condition of body said unto him, 'Upamanyu, my<br>child, I take from thee even the whole of what thou obtainest in alms,<br>without leaving anything for thee. How then dost thou, at present,<br>contrive to support thyself?' And Upamanyu said unto his preceptor, 'Sir,<br>having made over to you all that I obtain in alms, I go a-begging a<br>second time for supporting myself.' And his preceptor then replied, 'This<br>is not the way in which thou shouldst obey the preceptor. By this thou<br>art diminishing the support of others that live by begging. Truly having<br>supported thyself so, thou hast proved thyself covetous.' And Upamanyu,<br>having signified his assent to all that his preceptor said, went away to<br>attend the cattle. And having watched them all day, he returned to his<br>preceptor's house. And he stood before his preceptor and saluted him<br>respectfully. And his preceptor observing that he was still fat, said<br>again unto him, 'Upamanyu, my child, I take from thee all thou obtainest<br>in alms and thou dost not go a-begging a second time, and yet art thou in<br>healthy condition. How dost thou support thyself?' And Upamanyu, thus<br>questioned, answered, 'Sir, I now live upon the milk of these cows.' And<br>his preceptor thereupon told him, 'It is not lawful for thee to<br>appropriate the milk without having first obtained my consent.' And<br>Upamanyu having assented to the justice of these observations, went away<br>to tend the kine. And when he returned to his preceptor's abode, he stood<br>before him and saluted him as usual. And his preceptor seeing that he was<br>still fat, said, 'Upamanyu, my child, thou eatest no longer of alms, nor<br>dost thou go a-begging a second time, not even drinkest of the milk; yet<br>art thou fat. By what means dost thou contrive to live now? And Upamanyu<br>replied, 'Sir, I now sip the froth that these calves throw out, while<br>sucking their mother's teats.' And the preceptor said, 'These generous<br>calves, I suppose, out of compassion for thee, throw out large quantities<br>of froth. Wouldst thou stand in the way of their full meals by acting as<br>thou hast done? Know that it is unlawful for thee to drink the froth.'<br>And Upamanyu, having signified his assent to this, went as before to tend<br>the cows. And restrained by his preceptor, he feedeth not on alms, nor<br>hath he anything else to eat; he drinketh not of the milk, nor tasteth he<br>of the froth!<br><br>"And Upamanyu, one day, oppressed by hunger, when in a forest, ate of the<br>leaves of the Arka (Asclepias gigantea). And his eyes being affected by<br>the pungent, acrimonious, crude, and saline properties of the leaves<br>which he had eaten, he became blind. And as he was crawling about, he<br>fell into a pit. And upon his not returning that day when the sun was<br>sinking down behind the summit of the western mountains, the preceptor<br>observed to his disciples that Upamanyu was not yet come. And they told<br>him that he had gone out with the cattle.<br><br>"The preceptor then said, 'Upamanyu being restrained by me from the use<br>of everything, is, of course, and therefore, doth not come home until it<br>be late. Let us then go in search of him.' And having said this, he went<br>with his disciples into the forest and began to shout, saying, 'Ho<br>Upamanyu, where art thou?' And Upamanyu hearing his preceptor's voice<br>answered in a loud tone, 'Here I am at the bottom of a well.' And his<br>preceptor asked him how he happened to be there. And Upamanyu replied,<br>'Having eaten of the leaves of the Arka plant I became blind, and so have<br>I fallen into this well.' And his preceptor thereupon told him, 'Glorify<br>the twin Aswins, the joint physicians of the gods, and they will restore<br>thee thy sight.' And Upamanyu thus directed by his preceptor began to<br>glorify the twin Aswins, in the following words of the Rig Veda:<br><br>'Ye have existed before the creation! Ye first-born beings, ye are<br>displayed in this wondrous universe of five elements! I desire to obtain<br>you by the help of the knowledge derived from hearing, and of meditation,<br>for ye are Infinite! Ye are the course itself of Nature and intelligent<br>Soul that pervades that course! Ye are birds of beauteous feathers<br>perched on the body that is like to a tree! Ye are without the three<br>common attributes of every soul! Ye are incomparable! Ye, through your<br>spirit in every created thing, pervade the Universe!<br><br>"Ye are golden Eagles! Ye are the essence into which all things<br>disappear! Ye are free from error and know no deterioration! Ye are of<br>beauteous beaks that would not unjustly strike and are victorious in<br>every encounter! Ye certainly prevail over time! Having created the sun,<br>ye weave the wondrous cloth of the year by means of the white thread of<br>the day and the black thread of the night! And with the cloth so woven,<br>ye have established two courses of action appertaining respectively to<br>the Devas and the Pitris. The bird of Life seized by Time which<br>represents the strength of the Infinite soul, ye set free for delivering<br>her unto great happiness! They that are in deep ignorance, as long as<br>they are under delusions of their senses, suppose you, who are<br>independent of the attributes of matter, to be gifted with form! Three<br>hundred and sixty cows represented by three hundred and sixty days<br>produce one calf between them which is the year. That calf is the creator<br>and destroyer of all. Seekers of truth following different routes, draw<br>the milk of true knowledge with its help. Ye Aswins, ye are the creators<br>of that calf!<br><br>"The year is but the nave of a wheel to which is attached seven hundred<br>and twenty spokes representing as many days and nights. The circumference<br>of this wheel represented by twelve months is without end. This wheel is<br>full of delusions and knows no deterioration. It affects all creatures<br>whether to this or of the other worlds. Ye Aswins, this wheel of time is<br>set in motion by you!<br><br>"The wheel of Time as represented by the year has a nave represented by<br>the six seasons. The number of spokes attached to that nave is twelve as<br>represented by the twelve signs of the Zodiac. This wheel of Time<br>manifests the fruits of the acts of all things. The presiding deities of<br>Time abide in that wheel. Subject as I am to its distressful influence,<br>ye Aswins, liberate me from that wheel of Time. Ye Aswins, ye are this<br>universe of five elements! Ye are the objects that are enjoyed in this<br>and in the other world! Make me independent of the five elements! And<br>though ye are the Supreme Brahma, yet ye move over the Earth in forms<br>enjoying the delights that the senses afford.<br><br>"In the beginning, ye created the ten points of the universe! Then have<br>ye placed the Sun and the Sky above! The Rishis, according to the course<br>of the same Sun, perform their sacrifices, and the gods and men,<br>according to what hath been appointed for them, perform their sacrifices<br>also enjoying the fruits of those acts!<br><br>"Mixing the three colours, ye have produced all the objects of sight! It<br>is from these objects that the Universe hath sprung whereon the gods and<br>men are engaged in their respective occupations, and, indeed, all<br>creatures endued with life!<br><br>"Ye Aswins, I adore you! I also adore the Sky which is your handiwork! Ye<br>are the ordainers of the fruits of all acts from which even the gods are<br>not free! Ye are yourselves free from the fruits of your acts!<br><br>"Ye are the parents of all! As males and females it is ye that swallow<br>the food which subsequently develops into the life creating fluid and<br>blood! The new-born infant sucks the teat of its mother. Indeed it is ye<br>that take the shape of the infant! Ye Aswins, grant me my sight to<br>protect my life!"<br><br>The twin Aswins, thus invoked, appeared and said, 'We are satisfied. Here<br>is a cake for thee. Take and eat it.' And Upamanyu thus addressed,<br>replied, 'Your words, O Aswins, have never proved untrue. But without<br>first offering this cake to my preceptor I dare not take it.' And the<br>Aswins thereupon told him, 'Formerly, thy preceptor had invoked us. We<br>thereupon gave him a cake like this; and he took it without offering it<br>to his master. Do thou do that which thy preceptor did.' Thus addressed,<br>Upamanyu again said unto them, 'O Aswins, I crave your pardon. Without<br>offering it to my preceptor I dare not apply this cake.' The Aswins then<br>said, 'O, we are pleased with this devotion of thine to thy preceptor.<br>Thy master's teeth are of black iron. Thine shall be of gold. Thou shall<br>be restored to sight and shall have good fortune.'<br><br>"Thus spoken to by the Aswins he recovered his sight, and having gone to<br>his preceptor's presence he saluted him and told him all. And his<br>preceptor was well-pleased with him and said unto him, 'Thou shalt obtain<br>prosperity even as the Aswins have said. All the Vedas shall shine in<br>thee and all the Dharma-sastras.' And this was the trial of Upamanyu.<br><br>"Then Veda the other disciple of Ayoda-Dhaumya was called. His preceptor<br>once addressed him, saying, 'Veda, my child, tarry some time in my house<br>and serve thy preceptor. It shall be to thy profit.' And Veda having<br>signified his assent tarried long in the family of his preceptor mindful<br>of serving him. Like an ox under the burthens of his master, he bore heat<br>and cold, hunger and thirst, at all times without a murmur. And it was<br>not long before his preceptor was satisfied. And as a consequence of that<br>satisfaction, Veda obtained good fortune and universal knowledge. And<br>this was the trial of Veda.<br><br>"And Veda, having received permission from his preceptor, and leaving the<br>latter's residence after the completion of his studies, entered the<br>domestic mode of life. And while living in his own house, he got three<br>pupils. And he never told them to perform any work or to obey implicitly<br>his own behests; for having himself experienced much woe while abiding in<br>the family of his preceptor, he liked not to treat them with severity.<br><br>"After a certain time, Janamejaya and Paushya, both of the order of<br>Kshatriyas, arriving at his residence appointed the Brahman. Veda, as<br>their spiritual guide (Upadhyaya). And one day while about to depart upon<br>some business related to a sacrifice, he employed one of his disciples,<br>Utanka, to take charge of his household. 'Utanka', said he, 'whatsoever<br>should have to be done in my house, let it be done by thee without<br>neglect.' And having given these orders to Utanka, he went on his journey.<br><br>"So Utanka always mindful of the injunction of his preceptor took up his<br>abode in the latter's house. And while Utanka was residing there, the<br>females of his preceptor's house having assembled addressed him and said,<br>'O Utanka, thy mistress is in that season when connubial connection might<br>be fruitful. The preceptor is absent; then stand thou in his place and do<br>the needful.' And Utanka, thus addressed, said unto those women, 'It is<br>not proper for me to do this at the bidding of women. I have not been<br>enjoined by my preceptor to do aught that is improper.'<br><br>"After a while, his preceptor returned from his journey. And his<br>preceptor having learnt all that had happened, became well-pleased and,<br>addressing Utanka, said, 'Utanka, my child, what favour shall I bestow on<br>thee? I have been served by thee duly; therefore hath our friendship for<br>each other increased. I therefore grant thee leave to depart. Go thou,<br>and let thy wishes be accomplished!'<br><br>"Utanka, thus addressed, replied, saying, "Let me do something that you<br>wish, for it hath been said, 'He who bestoweth instruction contrary to<br>usage and he who receiveth it contrary to usage, one of the two dieth,<br>and enmity springeth up between the two.&#8212;I, therefore, who have received<br>thy leave to depart, am desirous of bringing thee some honorarium due to<br>a preceptor. His master, upon hearing this, replied, 'Utanka, my child,<br>wait a while.' Sometime after, Utanka again addressed his preceptor,<br>saying, 'Command me to bring that for honorarium, which you desire.' And<br>his preceptor then said, 'My dear Utanka, thou hast often told me of your<br>desire to bring something by way of acknowledgment for the instruction<br>thou hast received. Go then in and ask thy mistress what thou art to<br>bring. And bring thou that which she directs.' And thus directed by his<br>preceptor Utanka addressed his preceptress, saying, 'Madam, I have<br>obtained my master's leave to go home, and I am desirous of bringing<br>something agreeable to thee as honorarium for the instruction I have<br>received, in order that I may not depart as his debtor. Therefore, please<br>command me what I am to bring.' Thus addressed, his preceptress replied,<br>'Go unto King Paushya and beg of him the pair of ear-rings worn by his<br>Queen, and bring them hither. The fourth day hence is a sacred day when I<br>wish to appear before the Brahmanas (who may dine at my house) decked<br>with these ear-rings. Then accomplish this, O Utanka! If thou shouldst<br>succeed, good fortune shall attend thee; if not, what good canst thou<br>expect?'<br><br>"Utanka thus commanded, took his departure. And as he was passing along<br>the road he saw a bull of extraordinary size and a man of uncommon<br>stature mounted thereon. And that man addressed Utanka and said, 'Eat<br>thou of the dung of this bull.' Utanka, however, was unwilling to comply.<br>The man said again, 'O Utanka, eat of it without scrutiny. Thy master ate<br>of it before.' And Utanka signified his assent and ate of the dung and<br>drank of the urine of that bull, and rose respectfully, and washing his<br>hands and mouth went to where King Paushya was.<br><br>'On arriving at the palace, Utanka saw Paushya seated (on his throne).<br>And approaching him Utanka saluted the monarch by pronouncing blessings<br>and said, 'I am come as a petitioner to thee.' And King Paushya, having<br>returned Utanka's salutations, said, 'Sir, what shall I do for thee?' And<br>Utanka said, 'I came to beg of thee a pair of ear-rings as a present to<br>my preceptor. It behoveth thee to give me the ear-rings worn by the<br>Queen.'<br><br>"King Paushya replied, 'Go, Utanka, into the female apartments where the<br>Queen is and demand them of her.' And Utanka went into the women's<br>apartments. But as he could not discover the Queen, he again addressed<br>the king, saying, 'It is not proper that I should be treated by thee with<br>deceit. Thy Queen is not in the private apartments, for I could not find<br>her.' The king thus addressed, considered for a while and replied,<br>'Recollect, Sir, with attention whether thou art not in a state of<br>defilement in consequence of contact with the impurities of a repast. My<br>Queen is a chaste wife and cannot be seen by any one who is impure owing<br>to contact with the leavings of a repast. Nor doth she herself appear in<br>sight of any one who is defiled.'<br><br>"Utanka, thus informed, reflected for a while and then said, 'Yes, it<br>must be so. Having been in a hurry I performed my ablutions (after meal)<br>in a standing posture.' King Paushya then said, 'Here is a transgression,<br>purification is not properly effected by one in a standing posture, not<br>by one while he is going along.' And Utanka having agreed to this, sat<br>down with his face towards the east, and washed his face, hands, and feet<br>thoroughly. And he then, without a noise, sipped thrice of water free<br>from scum and froth, and not warm, and just sufficient to reach his<br>stomach and wiped his face twice. And he then touched with water the<br>apertures of his organs (eyes, ears, etc.). And having done all this, he<br>once more entered the apartments of the women. And this time he saw the<br>Queen. And as the Queen perceived him, she saluted him respectfully and<br>said, 'Welcome, Sir, command me what I have to do.' And Utanka said unto<br>her, 'It behoveth thee to give me those ear-rings of thine. I beg them as<br>a present for my preceptor.' And the Queen having been highly pleased<br>with Utanka's conduct and, considering that Utanka as an object of<br>charity could not be passed over, took off her ear-rings and gave them to<br>him. And she said, 'These ear-rings are very much sought after by<br>Takshaka, the King of the serpents. Therefore shouldst thou carry them<br>with the greatest care.'<br><br>"And Utanka being told this, said unto the Queen, 'Lady, be under no<br>apprehension. Takshaka, Chief of the serpents, is not able to overtake<br>me.' And having said this, and taking leave of the Queen, he went back<br>into the presence of Paushya, and said, 'Paushya, I am gratified.' Then<br>Paushya said to Utanka, 'A fit object of charity can only be had at long<br>intervals. Thou art a qualified guest, therefore do I desire to perform a<br>sraddha. Tarry thou a little. And Utanka replied, 'Yes, I will tarry, and<br>beg that the clean provisions that are ready may be soon brought in.' And<br>the king having signified his assent, entertained Utanka duly. And Utanka<br>seeing that the food placed before him had hair in it, and also that it<br>was cold, thought it unclean. And he said unto Paushya, 'Thou givest me<br>food that is unclean, therefore shalt thou lose thy sight.' And Paushya<br>in answer said, 'And because dost thou impute uncleanliness to food that<br>is clean, therefore shalt thou be without issue.' And Utanka thereupon<br>rejoined, 'It behoveth thee not, after having offered me unclean food, to<br>curse me in return. Satisfy thyself by ocular proof.'<br><br>"And Paushya seeing the food alleged to be unclean satisfied himself of<br>its uncleanliness. And Paushya having ascertained that the food was truly<br>unclean, being cold and mixed with hair, prepared as it was by a woman<br>with unbraided hair, began to pacify the Rishi Utanka, saying, 'Sir, the<br>food placed before thee is cold, and doth contain hair, having been<br>prepared without sufficient care. Therefore I pray thee pardon me. Let me<br>not become blind.' And Utanka answered, 'What I say must come to pass.<br>Having become blind, thou mayst, however, recover the sight before long.<br>Grant that thy curse also doth not take effect on me.' And Paushya said<br>unto him, 'I am unable to revoke my curse. For my wrath even now hath not<br>been appeased. But thou knowest not this. For a Brahmana's heart is soft<br>as new-churned butter, even though his words bear a sharp-edged razor. It<br>is otherwise in respect of these with the Kshatriya. His words are soft<br>as new-churned butter, but his heart is like a sharp-edged tool, such<br>being the case, I am unable, because of the hardness of my heart, to<br>neutralise my curse. Then go thou thy own way.' To this Utanka made<br>answer, "I showed thee the uncleanliness of the food offered to me, and I<br>was even now pacified by thee. Besides, saidst thou at first that because<br>I imputed uncleanliness to food that was clean I should be without issue.<br>But the food truly unclean, thy curse cannot affect me. Of this I am<br>sure.' And Utanka having said this departed with the ear-rings.<br><br>"On the road Utanka perceived coming towards him a naked idle beggar<br>sometimes coming in view and sometimes disappearing. And Utanka put the<br>ear-rings on the ground and went for water. In the meantime the beggar<br>came quickly to the spot and taking up the ear-rings ran away. And Utanka<br>having completed his ablutions in water and purified himself and having<br>also reverently bowed down to the gods and his spiritual masters pursued<br>the thief with the utmost speed. And having with great difficulty<br>overtaken him, he seized him by force. But at that instant the person<br>seized, quitting the form of a beggar and assuming his real form, viz.,<br>that of Takshaka, speedily entered a large hole open in the ground. And<br>having got in, Takshaka proceeded to his own abode, the region of the<br>serpents.<br><br>"Now, Utanka, recollecting the words of the Queen, pursued the Serpent,<br>and began to dig open the hole with a stick but was unable to make much<br>progress. And Indra beholding his distress sent his thunder-bolt (Vajra)<br>to his assistance. Then the thunder-bolt entering that stick enlarged<br>that hole. And Utanka began to enter the hole after the thunder-bolt. And<br>having entered it, he beheld the region of the serpents infinite in<br>extent, filled with hundreds of palaces and elegant mansions with turrets<br>and domes and gate-ways, abounding with wonderful places for various<br>games and entertainments. And Utanka then glorified the serpents by the<br>following slokas:<br><br>"Ye Serpents, subjects of King Airavata, splendid in battle and showering<br>weapons in the field like lightning-charged clouds driven by the winds!<br>Handsome and of various forms and decked with many coloured ear-rings, ye<br>children of Airavata, ye shine like the Sun in the firmament! On the<br>northern banks of the Ganges are many habitations of serpents. There I<br>constantly adore the great serpents. Who except Airavata would desire to<br>move in the burning rays of the Sun? When Dhritarashtra (Airavata's<br>brother) goes out, twenty-eight thousand and eight serpents follow him as<br>his attendants. Ye who move near him and ye who stay at a distance from<br>him, I adore all of you that have Airavata for your elder brother.<br><br>"I adore thee also, to obtain the ear-rings, O Takshaka, who formerly<br>dwelt in Kurukshetra and the forest of Khandava! Takshaka and Aswasena,<br>ye are constant companions who dwell in Kurukshetra on the banks of the<br>Ikshumati! I also adore the illustrious Srutasena, the younger brother of<br>Takshaka, who resided at the holy place called Mahadyumna with a view to<br>obtaining the chiefship of the serpents.<br><br>"The Brahmana Rishi Utanka having saluted the chief serpents in this<br>manner, obtained not, however, the ear-rings. And he thereupon became<br>very thoughtful. And when he saw that he obtained not the ear-rings even<br>though he had adored the serpents, he then looked about him and beheld<br>two women at a loom weaving a piece of cloth with a fine shuttle; and in<br>the loom were black and white threads. And he likewise saw a wheel, with<br>twelve spokes, turned by six boys. And he also saw a man with a handsome<br>horse. And he began to address them the following mantras:<br><br>"This wheel whose circumference is marked by twenty-four divisions<br>representing as many lunar changes is furnished with three hundred<br>spokes! It is set in continual motion by six boys (the seasons)! These<br>damsels representing universal nature are weaving without intermission a<br>cloth with threads black and white, and thereby ushering into existence<br>the manifold worlds and the beings that inhabit them! Thou wielder of the<br>thunder, the protector of the universe, the slayer of Vritra and Namuchi,<br>thou illustrious one who wearest the black cloth and displayest truth and<br>untruth in the universe, thou who ownest for thy carrier the horse which<br>was received from the depths of the ocean, and which is but another form<br>of Agni (the god of fire), I bow to thee, thou supreme Lord, thou Lord of<br>the three worlds, O Purandara!'<br><br>"Then the man with the horse said unto Utanka, 'I am gratified by this<br>thy adoration. What good shall I do to thee?' And Utanka replied, 'Even<br>let the serpents be brought under my control.' Then the man rejoined,<br>'Blow into this horse.' And Utanka blew into that horse. And from the<br>horse thus blown into, there issued, from every aperture of his body,<br>flames of fire with smoke by which the region of the Nagas was about to<br>be consumed. And Takshaka, surprised beyond measure and terrified by the<br>heat of the fire, hastily came out of his abode taking the ear-rings with<br>him, and said unto Utanka, 'Pray, Sir, take back the ear-rings.' And<br>Utanka took them back.<br><br>"But Utanka having recovered his ear-rings thought, 'O, this is that<br>sacred day of my preceptress. I am at a distance. How can I, therefore,<br>show my regard for her? And when Utanka was anxious about this, the man<br>addressed him and said, 'Ride this horse, Utanka, and he will in a moment<br>carry thee to thy master's abode.' And Utanka having signified his<br>assent, mounted the horse and presently reached his preceptor's house.<br><br>"And his preceptress that morning after having bathed was dressing her<br>hair sitting, thinking of uttering a curse on Utanka if he should not<br>return within time. But, in the meantime, Utanka entered his preceptor's<br>abode and paid his respects to his preceptress and presented her the<br>ear-rings. 'Utanka', said she, 'thou hast arrived at the proper time at<br>the proper place. Welcome, my child; thou art innocent and therefore I do<br>not curse thee! Good fortune is even before thee. Let thy wishes be<br>crowned with success!'<br><br>"Then Utanka waited on his preceptor. And his preceptor said, 'Thou art<br>welcome! What hath occasioned thy long absence?' And Utanka replied to<br>his preceptor, 'Sir, in the execution of this my business obstruction was<br>offered by Takshaka, the King of serpents. Therefore I had to go to the<br>region of the Nagas. There I saw two damsels sitting at a loom, weaving a<br>fabric with black and white threads. Pray, what is that? There likewise I<br>beheld a wheel with twelve spokes ceaselessly turned by six boys. What<br>too doth that import? Who is also the man that I saw? And what the horse<br>of extraordinary size likewise beheld by me? And when I was on the road I<br>also saw a bull with a man mounted thereon, by whom I was endearingly<br>accosted thus, 'Utanka, eat of the dung of this bull, which was also<br>eaten by thy master?' So I ate of the dung of that bull according to his<br>words. Who also is he? Therefore, enlightened by thee, I desire to hear<br>all about them.'<br><br>"And his preceptor thus addressed said unto him, 'The two damsels thou<br>hast seen are Dhata and Vidhata; the black and white threads denote night<br>and day; the wheel of twelve spokes turned by the six boys signified the<br>year comprising six seasons. The man is Parjanya, the deity of rain, and<br>the horse is Agni, the god of fire. The bull that thou hast seen on the<br>road is Airavata, the king of elephants; the man mounted thereon is<br>Indra; and the dung of the bull which was eaten by thee was Amrita. It<br>was certainly for this (last) that thou hast not met with death in the<br>region of the Nagas; and Indra who is my friend having been mercifully<br>inclined showed thee favour. It is for this that thou returnest safe,<br>with the ear-rings about thee. Then, O thou amiable one, I give thee<br>leave to depart. Thou shall obtain good fortune.'<br><br>"And Utanka, having obtained his master's leave, moved by anger and<br>resolved to avenge himself on Takshaka, proceeded towards Hastinapura.<br>That excellent Brahmana soon reached Hastinapura. And Utanka then waited<br>upon King Janamejaya who had some time before returned victorious from<br>Takshashila. And Utanka saw the victorious monarch surrounded on all<br>sides by his ministers. And he pronounced benedictions on him in a proper<br>form. And Utanka addressed the monarch at the proper moment in speech of<br>correct accent and melodious sounds, saying, 'O thou the best of<br>monarchs! How is it that thou spendest thy time like a child when there<br>is another matter that urgently demandeth thy attention?'"<br><br>"Sauti said, 'The monarch Janamejaya, thus addressed, saluting that<br>excellent Brahmana replied unto him, 'In cherishing these my subjects I<br>do discharge the duties of my noble tribe. Say, what is that business to<br>be done by me and which hath brought thee hither.'<br><br>"The foremost of Brahmanas and distinguished beyond all for good deeds,<br>thus addressed by the excellent monarch of large heart, replied unto him,<br>'O King! the business is thy own that demandeth thy attention; therefore<br>do it, please. O thou King of kings! Thy father was deprived of life by<br>Takshaka; therefore do thou avenge thy father's death on that vile<br>serpent. The time hath come, I think, for the act of vengeance ordained<br>by the Fates. Go then avenge the death of thy magnanimous father who,<br>being bitten without cause by that vile serpent, was reduced to five<br>elements even like a tree stricken by thunder. The wicked Takshaka,<br>vilest of the serpent race, intoxicated with power committed an<br>unnecessary act when he bit the King, that god-like father, the protector<br>of the race of royal saints. Wicked in his deeds, he even caused Kasyapa<br>(the prince of physicians) to run back when he was coming for the relief<br>of thy father. It behoveth thee to burn the wicked wretch in the blazing<br>fire of a snake-sacrifice. O King! Give instant orders for the sacrifice.<br>It is thus thou canst avenge the death of thy father. And a very great<br>favour shall have also been shown to me. For by that malignant wretch, O<br>virtuous Prince, my business also was, on one occasion, obstructed, while<br>proceeding on account of my preceptor."<br><br>"Sauti continued, The monarch, having heard these words, was enraged with<br>Takshaka. By the speech of Utanka was inflamed the prince, even as the<br>sacrificial fire with clarified butter. Moved by grief also, in the<br>presence of Utanka, the prince asked his ministers the particulars of his<br>father's journey to the regions of the blessed. And when he heard all<br>about the circumstances of his father's death from the lips of Utanka, he<br>was overcome with pain and sorrow.<br><br>And thus endeth the section called Paushya of the Adi Parva of the<br>blessed Mahabharata."
