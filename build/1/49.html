                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Saunaka said, 'Tell me again, in detail,&#8212;all that king Janamejaya had<br>asked his ministers about his father's ascension to heaven.'<br><br>'Sauti said, 'O Brahmana, hear all that the king asked his ministers, and<br>all that they said about the death of Parikshit.'<br><br>"Janamejaya asked, 'Know ye all that befell my father. How did that<br>famous king, in time, meet with his death? Hearing from you the incidents<br>of my father's life in detail, I shall ordain something, if it be for the<br>benefit of the world. Otherwise, I shall do nothing.'<br><br>'The minister replied, 'Hear, O monarch, what thou hast asked, viz., an<br>account of thy illustrious father's life, and how also that king of kings<br>left this world. Thy father was virtuous and high-souled, and always<br>protected his people. O, hear, how that high-souled one conducted himself<br>on earth. Like unto an impersonation of virtue and justice, the monarch,<br>cognisant of virtue, virtuously protected the four orders, each engaged<br>in the discharge of their specified duties. Of incomparable prowess, and<br>blessed with fortune, he protected the goddess Earth. There was none who<br>hated him and he himself hated none. Like unto Prajapati (Brahma) he was<br>equally disposed towards all creatures. O monarch, Brahmanas and<br>Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras, all engaged contentedly in the<br>practice of their respective duties, were impartially protected by that<br>king. Widows and orphans, the maimed and the poor, he maintained. Of<br>handsome features, he was unto all creatures like a second Soma.<br>Cherishing his subjects and keeping them contented, blessed with good<br>fortune, truth-telling, of immense prowess, he was the disciple of<br>Saradwat in the science of arms. And, O Janamejaya, thy father was dear<br>unto Govinda. Of great fame, he was loved by all men. And he was born in<br>the womb of Uttara when the Kuru race was almost extinct. And, therefore,<br>the mighty son of Abhimanyu came to be called Parikshit (born in an<br>extinct line). Well-versed in the interpretation of treatises on the<br>duties of kings, he was gifted with every virtue. With passions under<br>complete control, intelligent, possessing a retentive memory, the<br>practiser of all virtues, the conqueror of his six passions of powerful<br>mind, surpassing all, and fully acquainted with the science of morality<br>and political science, the father had ruled over these subjects for sixty<br>years. And he then died, mourned by all his subjects. And, after him, O<br>first of men, thou hast acquired this hereditary kingdom of the Kurus for<br>the last thousand years. Thou wast installed while a child, and art thus<br>protecting every creature.'<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'There hath not been born in our race a king who hath<br>not sought the good of his subjects or been loved by them. Behold<br>especially the conduct of my grandsires ever engaged in great<br>achievements. How did my father, blessed with many virtues, meet with his<br>death? Describe everything to me as it happened. I am desirous of hearing<br>it from you!'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Thus directed by the monarch, those councillors, ever<br>solicitous of the good of the king, told him everything exactly as it had<br>occurred.'<br><br>'And the councillors said, 'O king, that father of thine, that protector<br>of the whole earth, that foremost of all persons obedient to the<br>scriptures, became addicted to the sports of the field, even as Pandu of<br>mighty arms, that foremost of all bearers of the bow in battle. He made<br>over to us all the affairs of state from the most trivial to the most<br>important. One day, going into the forest, he pierced a deer with an<br>arrow. And having pierced it he followed it quickly on foot into the deep<br>woods, armed with sword and quiver. He could not, however, come upon the<br>lost deer. Sixty years of age and decrepit, he was soon fatigued and<br>became hungry. He then saw in the deep woods a high-souled Rishi. The<br>Rishi was then observing the vow of silence. The king asked him about the<br>deer, but, though asked, he made no reply. At last the king, already<br>tired with exertion and hunger, suddenly became angry with that Rishi<br>sitting motionless like a piece of wood in observance of his vow of<br>silence. Indeed, the king knew not that he was a Muni observing the vow<br>of silence. Swayed by anger, thy father insulted him. O excellent one of<br>the Bharata race, the king, thy father taking up from the ground with the<br>end of his bow a dead snake placed it on the shoulders of that Muni of<br>pure soul. But the Muni spake not a word good or bad and was without<br>anger. He continued in the same posture, bearing the dead snake.'"
