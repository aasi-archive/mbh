                            (Adivansavatarana Parva continued)<br><br>'Sauti said, 'Hearing that Janamejaya was installed in the<br>snake-sacrifice, the learned Rishi Krishna-Dwaipayana went thither on the<br>occasion. And he, the grand-father of the Pandavas, was born in an island<br>of the Yamuna, of the virgin Kali by Sakti's son, Parasara. And the<br>illustrious one developed by his will alone his body as soon as he was<br>born, and mastered the Vedas with their branches, and all the histories.<br>And he readily obtained that which no one could obtain by asceticism, by<br>the study of the Vedas, by vows, by fasts, by progeny, and by sacrifice.<br>And the first of Veda-knowing ones, he divided the Vedas into four parts.<br>And the Brahmana Rishi had knowledge of the supreme Brahma, knew the past<br>by intuition, was holy, and cherished truth. Of sacred deeds and great<br>fame, he begot Pandu and Dhritarashtra and Vidura in order to continue<br>the line of Santanu.<br><br>"And the high-souled Rishi, with his disciples all conversant with the<br>Vedas and their branches, entered the sacrificial pavilion of the royal<br>sage, Janamejaya. And he saw that the king Janamejaya was seated in the<br>sacrificial region like the god Indra, surrounded by numerous Sadasyas,<br>by kings of various countries whose coronal locks had undergone the<br>sacred bath, and by competent Ritwiks like unto Brahman himself. And that<br>foremost one of Bharata's race, the royal sage Janamejaya, beholding the<br>Rishi come, advanced quickly with his followers and relatives in great<br>joy. And the king with the approval of his Sadasyas, gave the Rishi a<br>golden seat as Indra did to Vrihaspati. And when the Rishi, capable of<br>granting boons and adored by the celestial Rishis themselves, had been<br>seated, the king of kings worshipped him according to the rites of the<br>scriptures. And the king then offered him&#8212;his grandfather Krishna&#8212;who<br>fully deserved them, water to wash his feet and mouth, and the Arghya,<br>and kine. And accepting those offerings from the Pandava Janamejaya and<br>ordering the kine also not to be slain, Vyasa became much gratified. And<br>the king, after those adorations bowed to his great-grandfather, and<br>sitting in joy asked him about his welfare. And the illustrious Rishi<br>also, casting his eyes upon him and asking him about his welfare,<br>worshipped the Sadasyas, having been before worshipped by them all. And<br>after all this, Janamejaya with all his Sadasyas, questioned that first<br>of Brahmanas, with joined palms as follows:<br><br>'O Brahmana, thou hast seen with thy own eyes the acts of the Kurus and<br>the Pandavas. I am desirous of hearing thee recite their history. What<br>was the cause of the disunion amongst them that was fruitful of such<br>extraordinary deeds? Why also did that great battle, which caused the<br>death of countless creatures occur between all my grandfathers&#8212;their<br>clear sense over-clouded by fate? O excellent Brahmana, tell me all this<br>in full as everything had happened.'<br><br>"Hearing those words of Janamejaya, Krishna-Dwaipayana directed his<br>disciple Vaisampayana seated by his side, saying, 'The discord that<br>happened between the Kurus and the Pandavas of old, narrate all to the<br>king even as thou hast heard from me.'<br><br>"Then that blessed Brahmana, at the command of his preceptor recited the<br>whole of that history unto the king, the Sadasyas, and all the chieftains<br>there assembled. And he told them all about the hostility and the utter<br>extinction of the Kurus and the Pandavas.'"
