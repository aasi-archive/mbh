                            (Jatugriha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, "King Dhritarashtra whose knowledge only was his<br>eyes, on hearing these words of his son and recollecting everything that<br>Kanika had, said unto him, became afflicted with sorrow, and his mind<br>also thereupon began to waver. Then Duryodhana and Karna, and Sakuni, the<br>son of Suvala, and Duhsasana as their fourth, held a consultation<br>together. Prince Duryodhana said unto Dhritarashtra, 'Send, O father, by<br>some clever contrivance, the Pandavas to the town of Varanavata. We shall<br>then have no fear of them.' Dhritarashtra, on hearing these words uttered<br>by his son, reflected for a moment and replied unto Duryodhana, saying,<br>'Pandu, ever devoted to virtue, always behaved dutifully towards all his<br>relatives but particularly towards me. He cared very little for the<br>enjoyments of the world, but devotedly gave everything unto me, even the<br>kingdom. His son is as much devoted to virtue as he, and is possessed of<br>every accomplishment. Of world-wide fame, he is again the favourite of<br>the people. He is possessed of allies; how can we by force exile him from<br>his ancestral kingdom? The counsellors and soldiers (of the state) and<br>their sons and grandsons have all been cherished and maintained by Pandu.<br>Thus benefited of old by Pandu, shall not, O child, the citizens slay us<br>with all our friends and relatives now on account of Yudhishthira?"<br><br>"Duryodhana replied, 'What thou sayest, O father, is perfectly true. But<br>in view of the evil that is looming on the future as regards thyself, if<br>we conciliate the people with wealth and honours, they would assuredly<br>side with us for these proofs of our power. The treasury and the<br>ministers of state, O king, are at this moment under our control.<br>Therefore, it behoveth thee now to banish, by some gentle means, the<br>Pandavas to the town of Varanavata; O king, when the sovereignty shall<br>have been vested in me, then, O Bharata, may Kunti with her children come<br>back from that place.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra replied, 'This, O Duryodhana, is the very thought existing<br>in my mind. But from its sinfulness I have never given expression to it.<br>Neither Bhishma, nor Drona, nor Kshattri, nor Gautama (Kripa) will ever<br>sanction the exile of the Pandavas. In their eyes, O dear son, amongst<br>the Kurus ourselves and the Pandavas are equal. Those wise and virtuous<br>persons will make no difference between us. If therefore, we behave so<br>towards the Pandavas, shall we not, O son, deserve death at the hands of<br>the Kurus, of these illustrious personages, and of the whole world?'<br><br>"Duryodhana answered, 'Bhishma hath no excess of affection for either<br>side, and will, therefore, be neutral (in case of dispute). The son of<br>Drona (Aswatthaman) is on my side. There is no doubt that where the son<br>is, there the father will be. Kripa, the son of Saradwat, must be on the<br>side on which Drona and Aswatthaman are. He will never abandon Drona and<br>his sister's son (Aswatthaman). Kshattri (Vidura) is dependent on us for<br>his means of life, though he is secretly with the foe. It he sides the<br>Pandavas, he alone can do us no injury, Therefore, exile thou the<br>Pandavas to Varanavata without any fear. And take such steps that they<br>may go thither this very day. By this act, O father, extinguish the grief<br>that consumeth me like a blazing fire, that robbeth me of sleep, and that<br>pierces my heart even like a terrible dart.'"
