                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'And Takshaka, after this, answered, 'If, indeed, thou art<br>able to cure any creature bitten by me, then, O Kasyapa, revive thou this<br>tree bit by me. O best of Brahmanas, I burn this banian in thy sight. Try<br>thy best and show me that skill in mantras of which thou hast spoken.'<br><br>"And Kasyapa said, If thou art so minded, bite thou then, O king of<br>snakes, this tree. O snake, I shall revive it, though bit by thee.<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'That king of snakes, thus addressed by the illustrious<br>Kasyapa, bit then that banian tree. And that tree, bit by the illustrious<br>snake, and penetrated by the poison of the serpent, blazed up all around.<br>And having burnt the banian so, the snake then spake again unto Kasyapa,<br>saying, 'O first of Brahmanas, try thy best and revive this lord of the<br>forest.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'The tree was reduced to ashes by the poison of that<br>king of snakes. But taking up those ashes, Kasyapa spoke these words. 'O<br>king of snakes, behold the power of my knowledge as applied to this lord<br>of the forest! O snake, under thy very nose I shall revive it.' And then<br>that best of Brahmanas, the illustrious and learned Kasyapa, revived, by<br>his vidya, that tree which had been reduced to a heap of ashes. And first<br>he created the sprout, then he furnished it with two leaves, and then he<br>made the stem, and then the branches, and then the full-grown tree with<br>leaves and all. And Takshaka, seeing the tree revived by the illustrious<br>Kasyapa, said unto him, 'It is not wonderful in thee that thou shouldst<br>destroy my poison or that of any one else like myself. O thou whose<br>wealth is asceticism, desirous of what wealth, goest thou thither? The<br>reward thou hopest to have from that best of monarchs, even I will give<br>thee, however difficult it may be to obtain it. Decked with fame as thou<br>art, thy success may be doubtful on that king affected by a Brahmana's<br>curse and whose span of life itself hath been shortened. In that case,<br>this blazing fame of thine that hath overspread the three worlds will<br>disappear like the Sun when deprived of his splendour (on the occasion of<br>the eclipse).'<br><br>"Kasyapa said, 'I go there for wealth, give it unto me, O snake, so that<br>taking thy gold. I may return.' Takshaka replied, 'O best of regenerate<br>ones, even I will give thee more than what thou expectest from that king.<br>Therefore do not go.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'That best of Brahmanas, Kasyapa, of great prowess and<br>intelligence, hearing those words of Takshaka, sat in yoga meditation<br>over the king. And that foremost of Munis, viz., Kasyapa, of great<br>prowess and gifted with spiritual knowledge, ascertaining that the period<br>of life of that king of the Pandava race had really run out, returned,<br>receiving from Takshaka as much wealth as he desired.<br><br>"And upon the illustrious Kasyapa's retracing his steps, Takshaka at the<br>proper time speedily entered the city of Hastinapura. And on his way he<br>heard that the king was living very cautiously, protected by means of<br>poison-neutralising mantras and medicines.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'The snake thereupon reflected thus, 'The monarch must<br>be deceived by me with power of illusion. But what must be the means?'<br>Then Takshaka sent to the king some snakes in the guise of ascetics<br>taking with them fruits, kusa grass, and water (as presents). And<br>Takshaka, addressing them, said, 'Go ye all to the king, on the pretext<br>of pressing business, without any sign of impatience, as if to make the<br>monarch only accept the fruits and flowers and water (that ye shall carry<br>as presents unto him).'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Those snakes, thus commanded by Takshaka, acted<br>accordingly. And they took to the king, Kusa grass and water, and fruits.<br>And that foremost of kings, of great prowess, accepted those offerings.<br>And after their business was finished, he said upto them, 'Retire.' Then<br>after those snakes disguised as ascetics had gone away, the king<br>addressed his ministers and friends, saying, 'Eat ye, with me, all these<br>fruits of excellent taste brought by the ascetics.' Impelled by Fate and<br>the words of the Rishi, the king, with his ministers, felt the desire of<br>eating those fruits. The particular fruit, within which Takshaka had<br>entered, was taken by the king himself for eating. And when he was eating<br>it, there appeared, O Saunaka, an ugly insect out of it, of shape<br>scarcely discernible, of eyes black, and of coppery colour. And that<br>foremost of kings, taking that insect, addressed his councillors, saying,<br>'The sun is setting; today I have no more tear from poison. Therefore,<br>let this insect become Takshaka and bite me, so that my sinful act may be<br>expiated and the words of the ascetic rendered true.' And those<br>councillors also, impelled by Fate, approved of that speech. And then the<br>monarch smiled, losing his senses, his hour having come. And he quickly<br>placed that insect on his neck. And as the king was smiling, Takshaka,<br>who had (in the form of that insect) come out of the fruit that had been<br>offered to the king, coiled himself round the neck of the monarch. And<br>quickly coiling round the king's neck and uttering a tremendous roar,<br>Takshaka, that lord of snakes, bit that protector of the earth.'"
