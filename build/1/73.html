                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'King Dushmanta, hearing all this, said,<br>'Well-spoken, O princess, this that thou hast said! Be my wife, O<br>beautiful one! What shall I do for thee? Golden garlands, robes,<br>ear-rings of gold, white and handsome pearls, from various countries,<br>golden coins, finest carpets, I shall present thee this very day. Let the<br>whole of my kingdom be thine today, O beautiful one! Come to me, O timid<br>one, wedding me, O beautiful one, according to the Gandharva form. O thou<br>of tapering thighs, of all forms of marriage, the Gandharva one is<br>regarded as the first.'<br><br>"Sakuntala, hearing this, said, 'O king, my father hath gone away from<br>this asylum to bring fruit. Wait but a moment; he will bestow me on thee.'<br><br>"Dushmanta replied, 'O beautiful and faultless one, I desire that thou<br>shouldst be my life's companion. Know thou that I exist for thee, and my<br>heart is in thee. One is certainly one's own friend, and one certainly<br>may depend upon one's own self. Therefore, according to the ordinance,<br>thou canst certainly bestow thyself. There are, in all, eight kinds of<br>marriages. These are Brahma, Daiva, Arsha, Prajapatya, Asura, Gandharva,<br>Rakshasa, and Paisacha, the eighth. Manu, the son of the self-create,<br>hath spoken of the appropriateness of all these forms according to their<br>order. Know, O faultless one, that the first four of these are fit for<br>Brahmanas, and the first six for Kshatriyas. As regards kings, even the<br>Rakshasa form is permissible. The Asura form is permitted to Vaisyas and<br>Sudras. Of the first five the three are proper, the other two being<br>improper. The Paisacha and the Asura forms should never be practised.<br>These are the institutes of religion, and one should act according to<br>them. The Gandharva and the Rakshasa form are consistent with the<br>practices of Kshatriyas. Thou needst not entertain the least fear. There<br>is not the least doubt that either according to any one of these<br>last-mentioned forms, or according to a union of both of them, our<br>wedding may take place. O thou of the fairest complexion, full of desire<br>I am, thou also in a similar mood mayst become my wife according to the<br>Gandharva form.'<br><br>"Sakuntala, having listened to all this, answered, 'If this be the course<br>sanctioned by religion, if, indeed, I am my own disposer, hear, O thou<br>foremost one of Puru's race, what my terms are. Promise truly to give me<br>what I ask thee. The son that shall be begotten on me shall become thy<br>heir-apparent. This, O king, is my fixed resolve. O Dushmanta, if thou<br>grant this, then let our union take place.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The monarch, without taking time to consider at<br>once told her, 'Let it be so. I will even take thee, O thou of agreeable<br>smiles, with me to my capital. I tell thee truly. O beautiful one, thou<br>deservest all this.' And so saying, that first of kings wedded the<br>handsome Sakuntala of graceful gait, and knew her as a husband. And<br>assuring her duly, he went away, telling her repeatedly, 'I shall send<br>thee, for thy escort, my troops of four classes. Indeed, it is even thus<br>that I shall take thee to my capital, O thou of sweet smiles!"<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'O Janamejaya, having promised so unto her, the<br>king went away. And as he retraced his way homewards, he began to think<br>of Kasyapa. And he asked himself, 'What will the illustrious ascetic say,<br>after he has known all?' Thinking of this, he entered his capital.<br><br>"The moment the king had left, Kanwa arrived at his abode. But Sakuntala,<br>from a sense of shame, did not go out to receive her father. That great<br>ascetic, however, possessed of spiritual knowledge, knew all. Indeed<br>beholding everything with his spiritual eye, the illustrious one was<br>pleased, and addressing her, said, 'Amiable one, what hath been done by<br>thee today in secret, without, having waited for me&#8212;viz., intercourse<br>with a man&#8212;hath not been destructive of thy virtue. Indeed, union<br>according to the Gandharva form, of a wishful woman with a man of sensual<br>desire, without mantras of any kind, it is said, is the best for<br>Kshatriyas. That best of men, Dushmanta, is also high-souled and<br>virtuous. Thou hast, O Sakuntala, accepted him for thy husband. The son<br>that shall be born of thee shall be mighty and illustrious in this world.<br>And he shall have sway over the sea. And the forces of that illustrious<br>king of kings, while he goeth out against his foes shall be irresistible.'<br><br>"Sakuntala then approached her fatigued father and washed his feet. And<br>taking down the load he had with him and placing the fruits in proper<br>order, she told him, 'It behoveth thee to give thy grace to that<br>Dushmanta whom I have accepted for my husband, as well as his ministers!'<br><br>"Kanwa replied, 'O thou of the fairest complexion, for thy sake I am<br>inclined to bless him. But receive from me, O blessed one, the boon that<br>thou desirest.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Sakuntala, thereupon, moved by desire of<br>benefiting Dushmanta, asked the boon that the Paurava monarchs might ever<br>be virtuous and never deprived of their thrones.'"
