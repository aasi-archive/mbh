                            (Hidimva-vadha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Bhima, beholding Hidimva following them, addressed<br>her, saying, 'Rakshasas revenge themselves on their enemies by adopting<br>deceptions that are incapable of being penetrated. Therefore, O Hidimva,<br>go thou the way on which thy brother hath gone.' Then Yudhishthira<br>beholding Bhima in rage, said, 'O Bhima, O tiger among men, however<br>enraged, do not slay a woman. O Pandava, the observance of virtue is a<br>higher duty than the protection of life. Hidimva, who had come with the<br>object of slaying us, thou hast already slain. This woman is the sister<br>of that Rakshasa, what can she do to us even if she were angry?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Hidimva reverentially saluting Kunti and<br>her son Yudhishthira also, said, with joined palms, 'O revered lady, thou<br>knowest the pangs that women are made to feel at the hands of the deity<br>of love. Blessed dame, these pangs, of which Bhimasena hath been the<br>cause, are torturing me. I had hitherto borne these insufferable pangs,<br>waiting for the time (when thy son could assuage them). That time is now<br>come, when I expected I would be made happy. Casting off my friends and<br>relations and the usage of my race, I have, O blessed lady, chosen this<br>son of thine, this tiger among men, as my husband. I tell thee truly, O<br>illustrious lady, that if I am cast off by that hero or by thee either, I<br>will no longer bear this life of mine. Therefore, O thou of the fairest<br>complexion, it behoveth thee to show me mercy, thinking me either as very<br>silly or thy obedient slave. O illustrious dame, unite me with this thy<br>son, my husband. Endued as he is with the form of a celestial, let me go<br>taking him with me wherever I like. Trust me, O blessed lady, I will<br>again bring him back unto you all. When you think of me I will come to<br>you immediately and convey you whithersoever ye may command. I will<br>rescue you from all dangers and carry you across inaccessible and uneven<br>regions. I will carry you on my back whenever ye desire to proceed with<br>swiftness. O, be gracious unto me and make Bhima accept me. It hath been<br>said that in a season of distress one should protect one's life by any<br>means. He, that seeketh to discharge that duty should not scruple about<br>the means. He, that in a season of distress keepeth his virtue, is the<br>foremost of virtuous men. Indeed, distress is the greatest danger to<br>virtue and virtuous men. It is virtue that protecteth life; therefore is<br>virtue called the giver of life. Hence the means by which virtue or the<br>observance of a duty is secured can never be censurable.'<br><br>"Hearing these words of Hidimva, Yudhishthira said. 'It is even so, O<br>Hidimva, as thou sayest. There is no doubt of it. But, O thou of slender<br>waist, thou must act even as thou hast said. Bhima will, after he hath<br>washed himself and said his prayers and performed the usual propitiatory<br>rites, pay his attentions to thee till the sun sets. Sport thou with him<br>as thou likest during the day, O thou that art endued with the speed of<br>the mind! But thou must bring back Bhimasena hither every day at<br>nightfall.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Bhima, expressing his assent to all that<br>Yudhishthira said, addressed Hidimva, saying, 'Listen to me, O Rakshasa<br>woman! Truly do I make this engagement with thee that I will stay with<br>thee, O thou of slender waist, until thou obtainest a son.' Then Hidimva,<br>saying, 'So be it,' took Bhima upon her body and sped through the sides.<br>On mountain peaks of picturesque scenery and regions sacred to the gods,<br>abounding with dappled herds and echoing with the melodies of feathered<br>tribes, herself assuming the handsomest form decked with every ornament<br>and pouring forth at times mellifluous strains. Hidimva sported with the<br>Pandava and studied to make him happy. So also, in inaccessible regions<br>of forests, and on mountain-breasts overgrown with blossoming trees on<br>lakes resplendent with lotuses and lilies, islands of rivers and their<br>pebbly banks, on sylvan streams with beautiful banks and<br>mountain-currents, in picturesque woods with blossoming trees and<br>creepers in Himalayan bowers, and various caves, on crystal pools smiling<br>with lotuses, on sea-shores shining with gold and pearls, in beautiful<br>towns and fine gardens, in woods sacred to the gods and on hill-sides, in<br>the regions of Guhyakas and ascetics, on the banks of Manasarovara<br>abounding with fruits and flowers of every season Hidimva, assuming the<br>handsomest form, sported with Bhima and studied to make him happy. Endued<br>with the speed of the mind, she sported with Bhima in all these regions,<br>till in time, she conceived and brought forth a mighty son begotten upon<br>her by the Pandava. Of terrible eyes and large mouth and straight arrowy<br>ears, the child was terrible to behold. Of lips brown as copper and sharp<br>teeth and loud roar, of mighty arms and great strength and excessive<br>prowess, this child became a mighty bowman. Of long nose, broad chest,<br>frightfully swelling calves, celerity of motion and excessive strength,<br>he had nothing human in his countenance, though born of man. And he<br>excelled (in strength and prowess) all Pisachas and kindred tribes as<br>well as all Rakshasas. And, O monarch, though a little child, he grew up<br>a youth the very hour he was born. The mighty hero soon acquired high<br>proficiency in the use of all weapons. The Rakshasa women bring forth the<br>very day they conceive, and capable of assuming any forms at will, they<br>always change their forms. And the bald-headed child, that mighty bowman,<br>soon after his birth, bowing down to his mother, touched her feet and the<br>feet also of his father. His parents then bestowed upon him a name. His<br>mother having remarked that his head was (bald) like unto a Ghata<br>(water-pot), both his parents thereupon called him Ghatotkacha (the<br>pot-headed). And Ghatotkacha who was exceedingly devoted to the Pandavas,<br>became a great favourite with them, indeed almost one of them.<br><br>"Then Hidimva, knowing that the period of her stay (with her husband) had<br>come to an end, saluted the Pandavas and making a new appointment with<br>them went away whithersoever she liked. And Ghatotkacha also&#8212;that<br>foremost of Rakshasas&#8212;promising unto his father that he would come when<br>wanted on business, saluted them and went away northward. Indeed, it was<br>the illustrious Indra who created (by lending a portion of himself) the<br>mighty car-warrior Ghatotkacha as a fit antagonist of Karna of unrivalled<br>energy, in consequence of the dart he had given unto Karna (and which was<br>sure to kill the person against whom it would be hurled).'"
