                            (Viduragamana Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'After Bhishma had concluded, Drona spoke, saying, 'O<br>king Dhritarashtra, it hath been heard by us that friends summoned for<br>consultation should always speak what is right, true, and conductive to<br>fame. O sire, I am of the same mind in this matter with the illustrious<br>Bhishma. Let a share of the kingdom be given unto the Pandavas. This is<br>eternal virtue. Send, O Bharata, unto Drupada without loss of time some<br>messenger of agreeable speech, carrying with him a large treasure for the<br>Pandavas. And let the man go unto Drupada carrying costly presents for<br>both the bridegrooms and the bride, and let him speak unto that monarch<br>of thy increase of power and dignity arising from this new alliance with<br>him. And, O monarch, let the man know also that both thyself and<br>Duryodhana have become exceedingly glad in consequence of what hath<br>happened. Let him say this repeatedly unto Drupada and Dhrishtadyumna.<br>And let him speak also about the alliance as having been exceedingly<br>proper, and agreeable unto thee, and of thyself being worthy of it. And<br>let the man repeatedly propitiate the sons of Kunti and those of Madri<br>(in proper words). And at thy command, O king, let plenty of ornaments of<br>pure gold be given unto Draupadi. And let, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>proper presents be given unto all the sons of Drupada. Let the messenger<br>then propose the return of the Pandavas to Hastinapura. After the heroes<br>will have been permitted (by Drupada), to come hither, let Duhsasana and<br>Vikarna go out with a handsome train to receive them. And when they will<br>have arrived at Hastinapura, let those foremost of men be received with<br>affection by thee. And let them then be installed on their paternal<br>throne, agreeably to the wishes of the people of the realm. This, O<br>monarch of Bharata's race, is what I think should be thy behaviour<br>towards the Pandavas who are to thee even as thy own sons.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'After Drona had ceased, Karna spake again,<br>'Both Bhishma and Drona have been pampered with wealth that is thine and<br>favours conferred by thee! They are also always regarded by thee as thy<br>trusted friends! What can therefore be more amusing than that they both<br>should give thee advice which is not for thy good? How can the wise<br>approve that advice which is pronounced good by a person speaking with<br>wicked intent but taking care to conceal the wickedness of his heart?<br>Indeed, in a season of distress, friends can neither benefit nor injure.<br>Every one's happiness or the reverse dependeth on destiny. He that is<br>wise and he that is foolish, he that is young (in years) and he that is<br>old, he that hath allies and he that hath none, all become, it is seen<br>everywhere, happy or unhappy at times. It hath been heard by us that<br>there was, of old, a king by name Amvuvicha. Having his capital at<br>Rajagriha, he was the king of all the Magadha chiefs. He never attended<br>to his affairs. All his exertion consisted in inhaling the air. All his<br>affairs were in the hands of his minister. And his minister, named<br>Mahakarni, became the supreme authority in the state. Regarding himself<br>all powerful, he began to disregard the king. And the wretch himself<br>appropriated everything belonging unto the king, his queens and treasures<br>and sovereignty. But the possession of all these, instead of satisfying<br>his avarice, only served to inflame him the more. Having appropriated<br>everything belonging to the king, he even coveted the throne. But it hath<br>been heard by us that with all his best endeavours he succeeded not in<br>acquiring the kingdom of the monarch, his master, even though the latter<br>was inattentive to business and content with only breathing the air. What<br>else can be said, O king, than that monarch's sovereignty was dependent<br>on destiny? If, therefore, O king, this kingdom be established in thee by<br>destiny, it will certainly continue in thee, even if the whole world were<br>to become thy enemy! If, however, destiny hath ordained otherwise,<br>howsoever mayest thou strive, it will not last in thee! O learned one,<br>remembering all this, judge of the honesty or otherwise of thy advisers.<br>Ascertain also who amongst them are wicked and who have spoken wisely and<br>well.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of Karna, Drona replied,<br>'As thou art wicked it is evident thou sayest so in consequence of the<br>wickedness of thy intent. It is for injuring the Pandavas that thou<br>findest fault with us. But know, O Karna, what I have said is for the<br>good of all and the prosperity of the Kuru race. If thou regardest all<br>this as productive of evil, declare thyself what is for our good. If the<br>good advice I have given be not followed, I think the Kurus will be<br>exterminated in no time.'"
