                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'O thou of the wealth of asceticism, tell me how our<br>ancestor Yayati, who is the tenth from Prajapati, obtained for a wife the<br>unobtainable daughter of Sukra. I desire to hear of it in detail. Tell me<br>also, one after another, of those monarchs separately who were the<br>founders of dynasties.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'The monarch Yayati was in splendour like unto Indra<br>himself. I will tell thee, in reply to thy question, O Janamejaya, how<br>both Sukra and Vrishaparvan bestowed upon him, with due rites, their<br>daughters, and how his union took place with Devayani in special.<br><br>"Between the celestials and the Asuras, there happened, of yore, frequent<br>encounters for the sovereignty of the three worlds with everything in<br>them. The gods, then, from desire of victory, installed the son of<br>Angiras (Vrihaspati) as their priest to conduct their sacrifices; while<br>their opponents installed the learned Usanas as their priest for the same<br>purpose. And between those two Brahmanas there are always much boastful<br>rivalry. Those Danavas assembled for encounter that were slain by the<br>gods were all revived by the seer Sukra by the power of his knowledge.<br>And then starting again, into life,&#8212;these fought with the gods. The<br>Asuras also slew on the field of battle many of the celestials. But the<br>open-minded Vrihaspati could not revive them, because he knew not the<br>science called Sanjivani (re-vivification) which Kavya endued with great<br>energy knew so well. And the gods were, therefore, in great sorrow. And<br>the gods, in great anxiety of heart and entertaining a fear of the<br>learned Usanas, then went to Kacha, the eldest son of Vrihaspati, and<br>spoke unto him, saying, 'We pay court to thee, be kind to us and do us a<br>service that we regard as very great. That knowledge which resides in<br>Sukra, that Brahmana of immeasurable prowess, make thy own as soon as<br>thou canst. Thou shalt find the Brahmana in the court of Vrishaparvan. He<br>always protects the Danavas but never us, their opponents. Thou art his<br>junior in age, and, therefore, capable of adoring him with reverence.<br>Thou canst also adore Devayani, the favourite daughter of that<br>high-souled Brahmana. Indeed, thou alone art capable of propitiating them<br>both by worship. There is none else that can do so. By gratifying<br>Devayani with thy conduct, liberality, sweetness, and general behaviour,<br>thou canst certainly obtain that knowledge.' The son of Vrihaspati, thus<br>solicited by the gods, said 'So be it, and went to where Vrishaparvan<br>was. Kacha, thus sent by the gods, soon went to the capital of the chief<br>of the Asuras, and beheld Sukra there. And beholding him, he thus spoke<br>unto him, 'Accept me as thy disciple. I am the grandson of the Rishi<br>Angiras and son of Vrihaspati. By name I am known as Kacha. Thyself<br>becoming my preceptor, I shall practise the Brahmacharya mode of life for<br>a thousand years. Command me, then, O Brahmana!'<br><br>"Sukra (hearing this) said, 'Welcome art thou, O Kacha! I accept thy<br>speech. I will treat thee with regard; for by so doing, it is Vrihaspati<br>who will be regarded.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Kacha commanded by Kavya or Usanas himself,<br>called also Sukra, then said, 'So be it,' and took the vow he had spoken<br>of. And, O Bharata, accepting the vow of which he had spoken, at the<br>proper time, Kacha began to conciliate regardfully both his preceptor and<br>(his daughter) Devayani. Indeed, he began to conciliate both. And as he<br>was young, by singing and dancing and playing on different kinds of<br>instruments, he soon gratified Devayani who was herself in her youth.<br>And, O Bharata, with his whole heart set upon it, he soon gratified the<br>maiden Devayani who was then a young lady, by presents of flowers and<br>fruits and services rendered with alacrity. And Devayani also with her<br>songs and sweetness of manners used, while they were alone, to attend<br>upon that youth carrying out his vow. And when five hundred years had<br>thus passed of Kacha's vow, the Danavas came to learn his intention. And<br>having no compunctions about slaying a Brahmana, they became very angry<br>with him. And one day they saw Kacha in a solitary part of the woods<br>engaged in tending (his preceptor's) kine. They then slew Kacha from<br>their hatred of Vrihaspati and also from their desire of protecting the<br>knowledge of reviving the dead from being conveyed by him. And having<br>slain him, they hacked his body into pieces and gave them to be devoured<br>by jackals and wolves. And (when twilight came) the kine returned to the<br>fold without him who tended them. And Devayani, seeing the kine returned<br>from the woods without Kacha, spoke, O Bharata, unto her father thus:<br><br>'Thy evening-fire hath been kindled. The Sun also hath set, O father! The<br>kine have returned without him who tendeth them. Kacha is, indeed, not to<br>be seen. It is plain that Kacha hath been lost, or is dead. Truly do I<br>say, O father, that without him I will not live.'<br><br>"Sukra hearing this said, I will revive him by saying, 'Let this one<br>come.' Then having recourse to the science of reviving the dead, Sukra<br>summoned Kacha. And summoned by his preceptor, Kacha appeared before him<br>in the gladness of heart tearing by virtue of his preceptor's science the<br>bodies of the wolves (that had devoured him). And asked about the cause<br>of his delay, he thus spoke unto Bhargava's daughter. Indeed, asked by<br>that Brahman's daughter, he told her, 'I was dead. O thou of pure<br>manners, burdened with sacrificial fuel, Kusa grass, and logs of wood, I<br>was coming towards our abode. I sat under a banian tree. The kine also,<br>having been brought together, were staying under the shade of that same<br>banian tree. The Asuras, beholding me, asked 'Who art thou?' They heard<br>me answer, 'I am the son of Vrihaspati.' As soon as I said this, the<br>Danavas slew me, and hacking my body into pieces gave my remains to<br>jackals and wolves. And they then went home in the gladness of heart. O<br>amiable one, summoned by the high-souled Bhargava, I after all come<br>before thee fully revived.'<br><br>"On another occasion, asked by Devayani, the Brahmana Kacha went into the<br>woods. And as he was roving about for gathering flowers, the Danavas<br>beheld him. They again slew him, and pounding him into a paste they mixed<br>it with the water of the ocean. Finding him long still (in coming), the<br>maiden again represented the matter unto her father. And summoned again<br>by the Brahmana with the aid of his science, Kacha appearing before his<br>preceptor and his daughter told everything as it had happened. Then<br>slaying him for the third time and burning him and reducing him to ashes,<br>the Asuras gave those ashes to the preceptor himself, mixing them with<br>his wine. And Devayani again spoke unto her father, saying, 'O father,<br>Kacha was sent to gather flowers. But he is not to be seen. It is plain<br>he hath been lost, or has died. I tell thee truly, I would not live<br>without him.'<br><br>"Sukra hearing this said, 'O daughter, the son of Vrihaspati hath gone to<br>the region of the dead. Though revived by my science, he is thus slain<br>frequently. What, indeed, am I to do? O Devayani, do not grieve, do not<br>cry. One like thee should not grieve for one that is mortal. Thou art<br>indeed, O daughter, in consequence of my prowess, worshipped thrice a day<br>during the ordained hours of prayer, by Brahmanas, the gods with Indra,<br>the Vasus, the Aswins, the Asuras, in fact, by the whole universe. It is<br>impossible to keep him alive, for revived by me he is often killed.' To<br>all this Devayani replied, 'Why shall I, O father, not grieve for him<br>whose grandfather is old Angiras himself, whose father is Vrihaspati who<br>is an ocean of ascetic merit, who is the grandson of a Rishi and the son<br>also of a Rishi? He himself too was a Brahmacharin and an ascetic; always<br>wakeful and skilled in everything. I will starve and follow the way Kacha<br>has gone. The handsome Kacha is, O father, dear unto me.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The great Rishi Kavya, then, afflicted by what<br>Devayani said, cried in anger, 'Certainly, the Asuras seek to injure me,<br>for they slay my disciple that stayeth with me. These followers of Rudra<br>desire to divest me of my character as a Brahmana by making me<br>participate in their crime. Truly, this crime hath a terrible end. The<br>crime of slaying a Brahmana would even burn Indra himself.' Having said<br>this, the Brahmana Sukra, urged by Devayani, began to summon Kacha who<br>had entered the jaws of Death. But Kacha, summoned with the aid of<br>science, and afraid of the consequence to his preceptor, feebly replied<br>from within the stomach of his preceptor, saying, 'Be graceful unto me, O<br>lord! I am Kacha that worshippeth thee. Behave unto me as to thy own<br>dearly-loved son.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Sukra then said, 'By what path, O Brahmana,<br>hast thou entered my stomach, where thou stayest now? Leaving the Asuras<br>this very moment, I shall go over to the gods." Kacha replied, 'By thy<br>grace, memory hath not failed me. Indeed, I do recollect everything as it<br>hath happened. My ascetic virtues have not been destroyed. It is,<br>therefore, that I am able to bear this almost insufferable pain. O Kavya,<br>slain by the Asuras and burnt and reduced to powder, I have been given to<br>thee with thy wine. When thou art present, O Brahmana, the art of the<br>Asuras will never be able to vanquish, the science of the Brahmana.'<br><br>"Hearing this, Sukra said, 'O daughter, what good can I do to thee? It is<br>with my death that Kacha can get his life back. O Devayani, Kacha is even<br>within me. There is no other way of his coming out except by ripping open<br>my stomach.' Devayani replied, 'Both evils shall, like fire, burn me! The<br>death of Kacha and thy own death are to me the same! The death of Kacha<br>would deprive me of life. If thou also diest, I shall not be able to bear<br>my life.' Then Sukra said, 'O son of Vrihaspati, thou art, indeed, one<br>already crowned with success, because Devayani regards thee so well.<br>Accept the science that I will today impart to thee, if, indeed, thou be<br>not Indra in the form of Kacha. None can come out of my stomach with<br>life. A Brahmana, however, must not be slain, therefore, accept thou the<br>science I impart to thee. Start thou into life as my son. And possessed<br>of the knowledge received from me, and revived by me, take care that, on<br>coming out of my body, thou dost act gracefully.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Receiving the science imparted to him by his<br>preceptor the handsome Kacha, ripped open his stomach, came out like the<br>moon at evening on the fifteenth day of the bright fort-night. And<br>beholding the remains of his preceptor lying like a heap of penances,<br>Kacha revived him, aided by the science he had learned. Worshipping him<br>with regard, Kacha said unto his preceptor, 'Him who poureth the nectar<br>of knowledge into one's ears, even as thou hast done into those of myself<br>who was void of knowledge, him do I regard both as my father and mother.<br>And remembering the immense service done by him, who is there so<br>ungrateful as to injure him? They that, having acquired knowledge, injure<br>their preceptor who is always an object of worship, who is the giver of<br>knowledge, who is the most precious of all precious objects on Earth,<br>come to be hated on Earth and finally go to the regions of the sinful.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The learned Sukra, having been deceived while<br>under the influence of wine, and remembering the total loss of<br>consciousness that is one of the terrible consequences of drink, and<br>beholding too before him the handsome Kacha whom he had, in a state of<br>unconsciousness, drunk with his wine, then thought of effecting a reform<br>in the manners of Brahmanas. The high-souled Usanas rising up from the<br>ground in anger, then spoke as follows: "The wretched Brahmana who from<br>this day, unable to resist the temptation, will drink wine shall be<br>regarded as having lost his virtue, shall be reckoned to have committed<br>the sin of slaying a Brahmana, shall be hated both in this and the other<br>worlds. I set this limit to the conduct and dignity of Brahmanas<br>everywhere. Let the honest, let Brahmanas, let those with regard for<br>their superiors, let the gods, let the three worlds, listen!' Having said<br>these words that high-souled one, that ascetic of ascetics, then<br>summoning the Danavas who had been deprived by fate of the good sense,<br>told them these words, Ye foolish Danavas, know ye that Kacha hath<br>obtained his wishes. He will henceforth dwell with me. Having obtained<br>the valuable knowledge of reviving the dead, that Brahmana hath, indeed,<br>become in prowess even as Brahman himself!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Bhargava having said so much cut short his<br>speech. The Danavas were surprised and went away to their homes. Kacha,<br>too, having stayed with his preceptor for a full thousand years, then<br>prepared to return to the abode of the celestials, after having obtained<br>his preceptor's permission.'"
