                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'O Brahmana, I have now heard from thee this great<br>history of my ancestors. I had also heard from thee about the great<br>monarchs that were born in this line. But I have not been gratified, this<br>charming account being so short. Therefore, be pleased, O Brahmana, to<br>recite the delightful narrative just in detail commencing from Manu, the<br>lord of creation. Who is there that will not be charmed with such an<br>account, as it is sacred? The fame of these monarchs increased by their<br>wisdom, virtue, accomplishments, and high character, hath so swelled as<br>to cover the three worlds. Having listened to the history, sweet as<br>nectar, of their liberality, prowess, physical strength, mental vigour,<br>energy, and perseverance, I have not been satiated!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Hear then, O monarch, as I recite in full the<br>auspicious account of thy own race just as I had heard it from Dwaipayana<br>before.<br><br>"Daksha begat Aditi, and Aditi begat Vivaswat, and Vivaswat begat Manu,<br>and Manu begat Ha and Ha begat Pururavas. And Pururavas begat Ayus, and<br>Ayus begat Nahusha, and Nahusha begat Yayati. And Yayati had two wives,<br>viz., Devayani, the daughter of Usanas, and Sarmishtha the daughter of<br>Vrishaparvan. Here occurs a sloka regarding (Yayati's) descendants,<br>'Devayani gave birth to Yadu and Turvasu; and Vrishaparvan's daughter,<br>Sarmishtha gave birth to Druhyu, Anu, and Puru., And the descendants of<br>Yadu are the Yadavas and of Puru are the Pauravas. And Puru had a wife of<br>the name of Kausalya, on whom he begat a son named Janamejaya who<br>performed three horse-sacrifices and a sacrifice called Viswajit. And<br>then he entered into the woods. And Janamejaya had married Ananta, the<br>daughter of Madhava, and begat upon her a son called Prachinwat. And the<br>prince was so called because he had conquered all the eastern countries<br>up to the very confines of the region where the Sun rises. And Prachinwat<br>married Asmaki, a daughter of the Yadavas and begat upon her a son named<br>Sanyati. And Sanyati married Varangi, the daughter of Drishadwata and<br>begat upon her a son named Ahayanti. And Ahayanti married Bhanumati, the<br>daughter of Kritavirya and begat upon her a son named Sarvabhauma. And<br>Sarvabhauma married Sunanda, the daughter of the Kekaya prince, having<br>obtained her by force. And he begat upon her a son named Jayatsena, who<br>married Susrava, the daughter of the Vidarbha king and begat upon her<br>Avachina, And Avachina also married another princess of Vidarbha, Maryada<br>by name. And he begat on her a son named Arihan. And Arihan married Angi<br>and begat on her Mahabhauma. And Mahabhauma married Suyajna, the daughter<br>of Prasenajit. And of her was born Ayutanayi. And he was so called<br>because he had performed a sacrifice at which the fat of an Ayuta (ten<br>thousands) of male beings was required. And Ayutanayi took for a wife<br>Kama, the daughter of Prithusravas. And by her was born a son named<br>Akrodhana, who took to wife Karambha, the daughter of the king of<br>Kalinga. And of her was born Devatithi, and Devatithi took for his wife<br>Maryada, the princess of Videha. And of her was born a son named Arihan.<br>And Arihan took to wife Sudeva, the princess of Anga, and upon her he<br>begat a son named Riksha. And Riksha married Jwala, the daughter of<br>Takshaka, and he begat upon her a son of the name of Matinara, who<br>performed on the bank of Saraswati the twelve years' sacrifice said to be<br>so efficacious. On conclusion of the sacrifice, Saraswati appeared in<br>person before the king and chose him for husband. And he begat upon her a<br>son named Tansu. Here occurs a sloka descriptive of Tansu's descendants.<br><br>"Tansu was born of Saraswati by Matinara. And Tansu himself begat a son<br>named Ilina on his wife, the princess Kalingi.<br><br>"Ilina begat on his wife Rathantari five sons, of whom Dushmanta was the<br>eldest. And Dushmanta took to wife Sakuntala, the daughter of Viswamitra.<br>And he begat on her a son named Bharata. Here occurs two slokas about<br>(Dushmanta's) descendants.<br><br>"The mother is but the sheath of flesh in which the father begets the<br>son. Indeed the father himself is the son. Therefore, O Dushmanta,<br>support thy son and insult not Sakuntala. O god among men, the father<br>himself becoming the son rescueth himself from hell. Sakuntala hath truly<br>said that thou art the author of this child's being.<br><br>"It is for this (i.e., because the king supported his child after hearing<br>the above speech of the celestial messenger) that Sakuntala's son came to<br>be called Bharata (the supported). And Bharata married Sunanda, the<br>daughter of Sarvasena, the king of Kasi, and begat upon her the son named<br>Bhumanyu. And Bhumanyu married Vijaya, the daughter of Dasarha. And he<br>begat upon her a son Suhotra who married Suvarna, the daughter of<br>Ikshvaku. To her was born a son named Hasti who founded this city, which<br>has, therefore, been called Hastinapura. And Hasti married Yasodhara, the<br>princess of Trigarta. And of her was born a son named Vikunthana who took<br>for a wife Sudeva, the princess of Dasarha. And by her was born a son<br>named Ajamidha. And Ajamidha had four wives named Raikeyi, Gandhari,<br>Visala and Riksha. And he begat on them two thousand and four hundred<br>sons. But amongst them all, Samvarana became the perpetuator of the<br>dynasty. And Samvarana took for his wife Tapati, the daughter of<br>Vivaswat. And of her was born Kuru, who married Subhangi, the princess of<br>Dasarha. And he begat on her a son named Viduratha, who took to wife<br>Supriya, the daughter of the Madhavas. And he begat upon her a son named<br>Anaswan. And Anaswan married Amrita, the daughter of the Madhavas. And of<br>her was born a son named Parikshit, who took for his wife Suvasa, the<br>daughter of the Vahudas, and begat upon her a son named Bhimasena. And<br>Bhimasena married Kumari, the princess of Kekaya and begat upon her<br>Pratisravas whose son was Pratipa. And Pratipa married Sunanda, the<br>daughter of Sivi, and begat upon her three sons, viz., Devapi, Santanu<br>and Valhika. And Devapi, while still a boy, entered the woods as a<br>hermit. And Santanu became king. Here occurs a sloka in respect of<br>Santanu.<br><br>"Those old men that were touched by this monarch not only felt an<br>indescribable sensation of pleasure but also became restored to youth.<br>Therefore, this monarch was called Santanu.<br><br>"And Santanu married Ganga, who bore him a son Devavrata who was<br>afterwards called Bhishma. And Bhishma, moved by the desire of doing good<br>to his father, got him married to Satyavati who was also called<br>Gandhakali. And in her maidenhood she had a son by Parasara, named<br>Dwaipayana. And upon her Santanu begat two other sons named Chitrangada<br>and Vichitravirya. And before they attained to majority, Chitrangada had<br>been slain by the Gandharvas. But Vichitravirya became king, and married<br>the two daughters of the king of Kasi, named Amvika and Amvalika. But<br>Vichitravirya died childless. Then Satyavati began to think as to how the<br>dynasty of Dushmanta might be perpetuated. Then she recollected the Rishi<br>Dwaipayana. The latter coming before her, asked, 'What are thy commands?'<br>'She said, 'Thy brother Vichitravirya hath gone to heaven childless.<br>Beget virtuous children for him.' Dwaipayana, consenting to this, begat<br>three children, viz., Dhritarashtra, Pandu, and Vidura. King<br>Dhritarashtra had a hundred sons by his wife, Gandhari in consequence of<br>the boon granted by Dwaipayana. And amongst those hundred sons of<br>Dhritarashtra, four became celebrated. They are Duryodhana, Duhsasana,<br>Vikarna, and Chitrasena. And Pandu had two jewels of wives, viz., Kunti,<br>also called Pritha, and Madri. One day Pandu, while out a-hunting, saw a<br>deer covering its mate. That was really a Rishi in the form of a deer.<br>Seeing the deer in that attitude, he killed it with his arrows, before<br>its desire was gratified. Pierced with the king's arrow, the deer quickly<br>changed its form and became a Rishi, and said unto Pandu, 'O Pandu, thou<br>art virtuous and acquainted also with the pleasure derived from the<br>gratification of one's desire. My desire unsatisfied, thou hast slain me!<br>Therefore, thou also, when so engaged and before thou art gratified,<br>shalt die!' Pandu, hearing this curse, became pale, and from that time<br>would not go in unto his wives. And he told them these words, 'Through my<br>own fault, I have been cursed! But I have heard that for the childless<br>there are no regions hereafter.' Therefore, he solicited Kunti to have<br>offspring raised for him. And Kunti said, 'Let it be', So she raised up<br>offspring. By Dharma she had Yudhishthira; by Maruta, Bhima: and by<br>Sakra, Arjuna. And Pandu, well-pleased with her, said, 'This thy co-wife<br>is also childless. Therefore, cause her also to bear children.' Kunti<br>saying, 'So be it,' imparted unto Madri the mantra of invocation. And on<br>Madri were raised by the twin Aswins, the twins Nakula and Sahadeva. And<br>(one day) Pandu, beholding Madri decked with ornaments, had his desire<br>kindled. And, as soon as he touched her, he died. Madri ascended the<br>funeral pyre with her lord. And she said unto Kunti, 'Let these twins of<br>mine be brought up by thee with affection.' After some time those five<br>Pandavas were taken by the ascetics of the woods to Hastinapura and there<br>introduced to Bhishma and Vidura. And after introducing them, the<br>ascetics disappeared in the very sight of all. And after the conclusion<br>of the speech of those ascetics, flowers were showered down upon the<br>spot, and the celestial drums also were beaten in the skies. The Pandavas<br>were then taken (by Bhishma). They then represented the death of their<br>father and performed his last honours duly. And as they were brought up<br>there, Duryodhana became exceedingly jealous of them. And the sinful<br>Duryodhana acting like Rakshasa tried various means to drive them away.<br>But what must be can never be frustrated. So all Duryodhana's efforts<br>proved futile. Then Dhritarashtra sent them, by an act of deception to<br>Varanavata, and they went there willingly. There an endeavour was made to<br>burn them to death; but it proved abortive owing to the warning counsels<br>of Vidura. After that the Pandavas slew Hidimva, and then they went to a<br>town called Ekachakra. There also they slew a Rakshasa of the name of<br>Vaka and then went to Panchala. And there obtaining Draupadi for a wife<br>they returned to Hastinapura. And there they dwelt for some time in peace<br>and begat children. And Yudhishthira begat Prativindhya; Bhima, Sutasoma;<br>Arjuna, Srutakriti; Nakula, Satanika; and Sahadeva, Srutakarman. Besides<br>these, Yudhishthira, having obtained for his wife Devika, the daughter of<br>Govasana of the Saivya tribe, in a self-choice ceremony, begat upon her a<br>son named Yaudheya. And Bhima also obtaining for a wife Valandhara, the<br>daughter of the king of Kasi, offered his own prowess as dower and begat<br>upon her a son named Sarvaga. And Arjuna also, repairing to Dwaravati,<br>brought away by force Subhadra. the sweet-speeched sister of Vasudeva,<br>and returned in happiness to Hastinapura. And he begat upon her a son<br>named Abhimanyu endued with all accomplishments and dear to Vasudeva<br>himself. And Nakula obtaining for his wife Karenumati, the princess of<br>Chedi, begat upon her a son named Niramitra. And Sahadeva also married<br>Vijaya, the daughter of Dyutimat, the king of Madra, obtaining her in a<br>self-choice ceremony and begat upon her a son named Suhotra. And<br>Bhimasena had some time before begat upon Hidimva a son named<br>Ghatotkacha. These are the eleven sons of the Pandavas. Amongst them all,<br>Abhimanyu was the perpetuator of the family. He married Uttara, the<br>daughter of Virata, who brought forth a dead child whom Kunti took up on<br>her lap at the command of Vasudeva who said, 'I will revive this child of<br>six months.' And though born before time, having been burnt by the fire<br>of (Aswatthaman's weapon) and, therefore, deprived of strength and energy<br>he was revived by Vasudeva and endued with strength, energy and prowess.<br>And after reviving him, Vasudeva said, 'Because this child hath been born<br>in an extinct race, therefore, he shall be called Parikshit'. And<br>Parikshit married Madravati, thy mother, O king, and thou art born to<br>her, O Janamejaya! Thou hast also begotten two sons on thy wife<br>Vapushtama, named Satanika and Sankukarna. And Satanika also hath<br>begotten one son named Aswamedhadatta upon the princess of Videha.<br><br>"Thus have I, O king, recited the history of the descendants of Puru and<br>of the Pandavas. This excellent, virtue-increasing, and sacred history<br>should ever be listened to by vow-observing Brahmanas, by Kshatriyas<br>devoted to the practices of their order and ready to protect their<br>subjects; by Vaisyas with attention, and by Sudras with reverence, whose<br>chief occupation is to wait upon the three other orders. Brahmanas<br>conversant in the Vedas and other persons, who with attention and<br>reverence recite this sacred history or listen to it when recited,<br>conquer the heavens and attain to the abode of the blessed. They are also<br>always respected and adored by the gods, Brahamanas, and other men. This<br>holy history of Bharata hath been composed by the sacred and illustrious<br>Vyasa. Veda-knowing Brahmanas and other persons who with reverence and<br>without malice hear it recited, earn great religious merits and conquer<br>the heavens. Though sinning, they are not disregarded by any one. Here<br>occurs a sloka, 'This (Bharata) is equal unto the Vedas: it is holy and<br>excellent. It bestoweth wealth, fame, and life. Therefore, it should be<br>listened to by men with rapt attention.'"
