                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Some time after, Bhishma the intelligent son of<br>Santanu set his heart upon getting Pandu married to a second wife.<br>Accompanied by an army composed of four kinds of force, and also by aged<br>councillors and Brahmanas and great Rishis, he went to the capital of the<br>king of Madra. And that bull of the Valhikas&#8212;the king of Madra&#8212;hearing<br>that Bhishma had arrived, went out to receive him. And having received<br>him with respect, he got him to enter his palace. Arriving there, the<br>king of Madra offered unto Bhishma a white carpet for a seat; water to<br>wash his feet with, and usual oblation of various ingredients indicative<br>of respect. And when he was seated at ease, the king asked him about the<br>reason of his visit. Then Bhishma&#8212;the supporter of the dignity of the<br>Kurus&#8212;addressed the king of Madra and said, 'O oppressor of all foes,<br>know that I have come for the hand of a maiden. It hath been heard by us<br>that thou hast a sister named Madri celebrated for her beauty and endued<br>with every virtue; I would chose her for Pandu. Thou art, O king, in<br>every respect worthy of an alliance with us, and we also are worthy of<br>thee. Reflecting upon all this, O king of Madra, accept us duly.' The<br>ruler of Madra, thus addressed by Bhishma, replied, 'To my mind, there is<br>none else than one of thy family with whom I can enter into an alliance.<br>But there is a custom in our family observed by our ancestors, which, be<br>it good or bad, I am incapable of transgressing. It is well-known, and<br>therefore is known to thee as well, I doubt not. Therefore, it is not<br>proper for thee to say to me,&#8212;Bestow thy sister. The custom to which I<br>allude is our family custom. With us that is a virtue and worthy of<br>observance. It is for this only, O slayer of foes, I cannot give thee any<br>assurance in the matter of thy request.' On hearing this, Bhishma<br>answered the king of Madra, saying, 'O king, this, no doubt,' is a<br>virtue. The self-create himself hath said it. Thy ancestors were<br>observant of custom. There is no fault to find with it. It is also<br>well-known, O Salya, that this custom in respect of family dignity hath<br>the approval of the wise and the good.' Saying this Bhishma of great<br>energy, gave unto Salya much gold both coined and uncoined, and precious<br>stones of various colours by thousands, and elephants and horses and<br>cars, and much cloth and many ornaments, and gems and pearls and corals.<br>And Salya accepting with a cheerful heart those precious gifts then gave<br>away his sister decked in ornaments unto that bull of the Kuru race. Then<br>the wise Bhishma, the son of the oceangoing Ganga, rejoiced at the issue<br>of his mission, took Madri with him, and returned to the Kuru capital<br>named after the elephant.<br><br>"Then selecting on auspicious day and moment as indicated by the wise for<br>the ceremony, King Pandu was duly united with Madri. And after the<br>nuptials were over, the Kuru king established his beautiful bride in<br>handsome apartments. And, O king of kings, that best of monarchs then<br>gave himself up to enjoyment in the company of his two wives as best he<br>liked and to the limit of his desires. And after thirty days had elapsed,<br>the Kuru king, O monarch, started from his capital for the conquest of<br>the world. And after reverentially saluting and bowing to Bhishma and the<br>other elders of the Kuru race, and with adieus to Dhritarashtra and<br>others of the family, and obtaining their leave, he set out on his grand<br>campaign, accompanied by a large force of elephants, horses, and cars,<br>and well-pleased with the blessings uttered by all around and the<br>auspicious rites performed by the citizens for his success. And Pandu,<br>accompanied by such a strong force marched against various foes. And that<br>tiger among men&#8212;that spreader of the fame of the Kurus&#8212;first subjugated<br>the robber tribes of asarna. He next turned his army composed of<br>innumerable elephants, cavalry, infantry, and charioteers, with standards<br>of various colours against Dhirga&#8212;the ruler of the kingdom of Maghadha<br>who was proud of his strength, and offended against numerous monarchs.<br>And attacking him in his capital, Pandu slew him there, and took<br>everything in his treasury and also vehicles and draught animals without<br>number. He then marched into Mithila and subjugated the Videhas. And<br>then, O bull among men, Pandu led his army against Kasi, Sumbha, and<br>Pundra, and by the strength and prowess of his arms spread the fame of<br>the Kurus. And Pandu, that oppressor of foes, like unto a mighty fire<br>whose far-reaching flames were represented by his arrows and splendour by<br>his weapons, began to consume all kings that came in contact with him.<br>These with their forces, vanquished by Pandu at the head of his army,<br>were made the vassals of the Kurus. And all kings of the world, thus<br>vanquished by him, regarded him as the one single hero on earth even as<br>the celestials regard Indra in heaven. And the kings of earth with joined<br>palms bowed to him and waited on him with presents of various kinds of<br>gems and wealth, precious stones and pearls and corals, and much gold and<br>silver, and first-class kine and handsome horses and fine cars and<br>elephants, and asses and camels and buffaloes, and goats and sheep, and<br>blankets and beautiful hides, and cloths woven out of furs. And the king<br>of Hastinapura accepting those offerings retraced his steps towards his<br>capital, to the great delight of his subjects. And the citizens and<br>others filled with joy, and kings and ministers, all began to say, 'O,<br>the fame of the achievements of Santanu, that tiger among kings, and of<br>the wise Bharata, which were about to die, hath been revived by Pandu.<br>They who robbed before the Kurus of both territory and wealth have been<br>subjugated by Pandu&#8212;the tiger of Hastinapura&#8212;and made to pay tribute.'<br>And all the citizens with Bhishma at their head went out to receive the<br>victorious king. They had not proceeded far when they saw the attendants<br>of the king laden with much wealth, and the train of various conveyances<br>laden with all kinds of wealth, and of elephants, horses, cars, kine,<br>camels and other animals, was so long that they saw not its end. Then<br>Pandu, beholding Bhishma, who was a father to him, worshipped his feet<br>and saluted the citizens and others as each deserved. And Bhishma, too,<br>embracing Pandu as his son who had returned victorious after grinding<br>many hostile kingdoms, wept tears of joy. And Pandu, instilling joy into<br>the hearts of his people with a flourish of trumpets and conchs and<br>kettle-drums, entered his capital.'"
