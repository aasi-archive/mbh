                            (Vaivahika Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Drupada, on hearing this, observed, O great Rishi,<br>it was only when I had not heard this from thee that I had sought to act<br>in the way I told thee of. Now, however, that I know all, I cannot be<br>indifferent to what hath been ordained by the gods. Therefore do I<br>resolve to accomplish what thou hast said. The knot of destiny cannot be<br>untied. Nothing in this world is the result of our own acts. That which<br>had been appointed by us in view of securing one only bridegroom hath now<br>terminated in favour of many. As Krishna (in a former life) had<br>repeatedly said, 'O, give me a husband!' the great god himself even gave<br>her the boon she had asked. The god himself knows the right or wrong of<br>this. As regards myself, when Sankara hath ordained so, right or wrong,<br>no sin can attach to me. Let these with happy hearts take, as ordained,<br>the hand of Krishna with the rites.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then the illustrious Vyasa, addressing<br>Yudhishthira the just, said, 'This day is an auspicious day, O son of<br>Pandu! This day the moon has entered the constellation called Pushya.<br>Take thou the hand of Krishna today, thyself first before thy brothers!'<br>When Vyasa had said so, king Yajnasena and his son made preparations for<br>the wedding. And the monarch kept ready various costly articles as<br>marriage presents. Then he brought out his daughter Krishna, decked,<br>after a bath, with many jewels and pearls. Then there came to witness the<br>wedding all the friends and relatives of the king, ministers of state,<br>and many Brahmanas and citizens. And they all took their seats according<br>to their respective ranks. Adorned with that concourse of principal men,<br>with its yard decked with lotuses and lilies scattered thereupon, and<br>beautified with lines of troops, king Drupada's palace, festooned around<br>with diamonds and precious stones, looked like the firmament studded with<br>brilliant stars. Then those princes of the Kuru line, endued with youth<br>and adorned with ear-rings, attired in costly robes and perfumed with<br>sandal-paste, bathed and performed the usual religious rites and<br>accompanied by their priest Dhaumya who was possessed of the splendour of<br>fire, entered the wedding hall one after another in due order, and with<br>glad hearts, like mighty bulls entering a cow-pen. Then Dhaumya,<br>well-conversant with the Vedas, igniting the sacred fire, poured with due<br>mantras libations of clarified butter into that blazing element. And<br>calling Yudhishthira there, Dhaumya, acquainted with mantras, united him<br>with Krishna. Walking round the fire the bridegroom and the bride took<br>each other's hand. After their union was complete, the priest Dhaumya,<br>taking leave of Yudhishthira, that ornament of battles, went out of the<br>palace. Then those mighty car-warriors,&#8212;those perpetuators of the Kuru<br>line,&#8212;those princes attired in gorgeous dresses, took the hand of that<br>best of women, day by day in succession, aided by that priest. O king,<br>the celestial Rishi told me of a very wonderful and extraordinary thing<br>in connection with these marriages, viz., that the illustrious princess<br>of slender waist regained her virginity every day after a previous<br>marriage. After the weddings were over, king Drupada gave unto those<br>mighty car-warriors diverse kinds of excellent wealth. And the king gave<br>unto them one hundred cars with golden standards, each drawn by four<br>steeds with golden bridles. And he gave them one hundred elephants all<br>possessing auspicious marks on their temples and faces and like unto a<br>hundred mountains with golden peaks. He also gave them a hundred female<br>servants all in the prime of youth and clad in costly robes and ornaments<br>and floral wreaths. And the illustrious monarch of the Lunar race gave<br>unto each of those princes of celestial beauty, making the sacred fire a<br>witness of his gifts, much wealth and many costly robes and ornaments of<br>great splendour. The sons of Pandu endued with great strength, after<br>their wedding were over, and after they had obtained Krishna like unto a<br>second Sri along with great wealth, passed their days in joy and<br>happiness, like so many Indras, in the capital of the king of the<br>Panchalas,'"
