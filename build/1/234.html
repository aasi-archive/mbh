                            (Khandava-daha Parva continued)<br><br>"Jaritari said, 'The person that is wise remaineth wakeful in view of<br>death. Accordingly, when the hour of death approacheth, he feeleth no<br>pangs. But the person of perplexed soul, who remaineth not awake, when<br>the hour of death comes, feeleth the pangs of death and never attaineth<br>salvation.'<br><br>"The second brother Sarisrikka, said, 'Thou art patient and intelligent.<br>The time is come when our lives are threatened. Without doubt, one only<br>amongst many becometh wise and brave.'<br><br>"The third brother, Stamvamitra, said, 'The eldest brother is called the<br>protector. It is the eldest brother that rescueth (the younger ones) from<br>danger. If the eldest himself faileth to rescue them, what can the<br>younger ones do?'<br><br>"The fourth and the youngest brother, Drona said, 'The cruel god of fire,<br>with seven tongues and seven mouths quickly cometh towards our<br>habitation, blazing forth in splendour and licking up everything in his<br>path.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having addressed one another thus, the sons of<br>Mandapala then each devotedly addressed an eulogistic hymn to Agni.<br>Listen now, O monarch, to those hymns as I recite them.'<br><br>"Jaritari said, 'Thou art, O fire, the soul of air! Thou art the body of<br>the Earth's vegetation! O Sukra, water is thy parent as thou art the<br>parent of water! O thou of great energy, thy flames, like the rays of the<br>sun, extend themselves above, below, behind, and on each side.'<br><br>"Sarisrikka said, 'O smoke-bannered god, our mother is not to be seen,<br>and we know not our father! Our feathers have not grown as yet. We have<br>none to protect us save thee. Therefore, O Agni, infants that we are<br>protect us! O Agni, as we are distressed, protect us with that auspicious<br>form thou hast and with those seven flames of thine! We seek protection<br>at thy hands. Thou alone, O Agni, art the giver of heat (in the<br>universe). O lord, there is none else (save thee) that giveth heat to the<br>rays of the sun. O, protect us who are young and who are Rishis. O<br>Havyavaha (carrier of sacrificial butter), be pleased to go hence by some<br>other route.'<br><br>"Stamvamitra said, 'Thou alone, O Agni, art everything! This whole<br>universe is established in thee! Thou sustainest every creature, and thou<br>supportest the universe! Thou art the carrier of the sacrificial butter,<br>and thou art the excellent sacrificial butter itself! The wise know thee<br>to be one (as cause) and many (as effects)! Having created the three<br>worlds, thou, O Havyavaha, again destroyest them when the time cometh,<br>swelling thyself forth! Thou art the productive cause of the whole<br>universe, and thou also art the essence in which the universe dissolveth<br>itself!'<br><br>"Drona said, 'O lord of the universe, growing in strength and remaining<br>within their bodies, thou causest the food that living creatures eat to<br>be digested. Everything therefore, is established in thee. O Sukra, O<br>thou from whose mouth the Vedas have sprung, it is thou who assumests the<br>form of the sun, and sucking up the waters of the earth and every liquid<br>juice that the earth yields, givest them back in time in the form of rain<br>and causest everything to grow! From thee, O Sukra, are these plants and<br>creepers with green foliage! From thee have sprung these tanks and pools,<br>and the great ocean also that is ever blessed! O thou of fierce rays,<br>this our (human) body dependeth on Varuna (the water-god)! We are unable<br>to bear thy heat. Be thou, therefore, our auspicious protector! O,<br>destroy us not! O thou of copper-hued eyes, O thou of red neck, O thou<br>whose path is marked by a black colour, save us by going along any remote<br>route, as indeed, the ocean saveth the house on its banks!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by Drona&#8212;that utterer of<br>Brahma&#8212;Agni, well-pleased at what he heard, and remembering also the<br>promise he had made to Mandapala, replied unto him, saying, 'Thou art a<br>Rishi, O Drona! For what thou hast said is Brahma (Vedic truth). I shall<br>do your pleasure. Fear not! Indeed, Mandapala had spoken to me of you to<br>the effect that I should spare his sons, while consuming the forest. The<br>words he spoke and thy speech also are entitled to great weight to me.<br>Say what I am to do. O best of Brahmanas, I have been greatly pleased<br>with thy hymn. Blest be thou, O Brahmana!'<br><br>"Drona said, 'O Sukra, these cats trouble us every day. O Hutasana;<br>consume them with their friends and relatives.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Agni did what the Sarngakas; asked him to<br>do, telling them of his intentions. And, O Janamejaya, growing in<br>strength, he began then to consume the forest of Khandava.'"
