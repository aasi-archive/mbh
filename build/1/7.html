                            (Pauloma Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'the god of fire enraged at the curse of Bhrigu, thus<br>addressed the Rishi, 'What meaneth this rashness, O Brahmana, that thou<br>hast displayed towards me? What transgression can be imputed to me who<br>was labouring to do justice and speak the truth impartially? Being asked<br>I gave the true answer. A witness who when interrogated about a fact of<br>which he hath knowledge, representeth otherwise than it is, ruineth his<br>ancestors and descendants both to the seventh generation. He, too, who,<br>being fully cognisant of all the particulars of an affair, doth not<br>disclose what he knoweth, when asked, is undoubtedly stained with guilt.<br>I can also curse thee, but Brahmanas are held by me in high respect.<br>Although these are known to thee, O Brahmana, I will yet speak of them,<br>so please attend! Having, by ascetic power, multiplied myself, I am<br>present in various forms, in places of the daily homa, at sacrifices<br>extending for years, in places where holy rites are performed (such as<br>marriage, etc.), and at other sacrifices. With the butter that is poured<br>upon my flame according to the injunctions prescribed in the Vedas, the<br>Devas and the Pitris are appeased. The Devas are the waters; the Pitris<br>are also the waters. The Devas have with the Pitris an equal right to the<br>sacrifices called Darshas and Purnamasas. The Devas therefore are the<br>Pitris and the Pitris, the Devas. They are identical beings, worshipped<br>together and also separately at the changes of the moon. The Devas and<br>the Pitris eat what is poured upon me. I am therefore called the mouth of<br>the Devas and the Pitris. At the new moon the Pitris, and at the full<br>moon the Devas, are fed through my mouth, eating of the clarified butter<br>that is poured on me. Being, as I am, their mouth, how am I to be an<br>eater of all things (clean and unclean)?<br><br>"Then Agni, alter reflecting for a while, withdrew himself from all<br>places; from places of the daily homa of the Brahmanas, from all<br>long-extending sacrifices, from places of holy rites, and from other<br>ceremonies. Without their Oms and Vashats, and deprived of their Swadhas<br>and Swahas (sacrificial mantras during offerings), the whole body of<br>creatures became much distressed at the loss of their (sacrificial) fire.<br>The Rishis in great anxiety went to the gods and addressed them thus, 'Ye<br>immaculate beings! The three regions of the universe are confounded at<br>the cessation of their sacrifices and ceremonies in consequence of the<br>loss of fire! Ordain what is to be done in tins matter, so that there may<br>be no loss of time.' Then the Rishis and the gods went together to the<br>presence of Brahma. And they represented to him all about the curse on<br>Agni and the consequent interruption of all ceremonies. And they said, 'O<br>thou greatly fortunate! Once Agni hath been cursed by Bhrigu for some<br>reason. Indeed, being the mouth of the gods and also the first who eateth<br>of what is offered in sacrifices, the eater also of the sacrificial<br>butter, how will Agni be reduced to the condition of one who eateth of<br>all things promiscuously?' And the creator of the universe hearing these<br>words of theirs summoned Agni to his presence. And Brahma addressed Agni,<br>the creator of all and eternal as himself, in these gentle words, 'Thou<br>art the creator of the worlds and thou art their destroyer! Thou<br>preserves! the three worlds and thou art the promoter of all sacrifices<br>and ceremonies! Therefore behave thyself so that ceremonies be not<br>interrupted. And, O thou eater of the sacrificial butter, why dost thou<br>act so foolishly, being, as thou art, the Lord of all? Thou alone art<br>always pure in the universe and thou art its stay! Thou shall not, with<br>all thy body, be reduced to the state of one who eateth of all things<br>promiscuously. O thou of flames, the flame that is in thy viler parts<br>shall alone eat of all things alike. The body of thine which eateth of<br>flesh (being in the stomach of all carnivorous animals) shall also eat of<br>all things promiscuously. And as every thing touched by the sun's rays<br>becometh pure, so shall everything be pure that shall be burnt by thy<br>flames. Thou art, O fire, the supreme energy born of thy own power. Then,<br>O Lord, by that power of thine make the Rishi's curse come true. Continue<br>to 'receive thy own portion and that of the gods, offered at thy mouth.'<br><br>'Sauti continued, 'Then Agni replied to the Grandfather, 'So be it.' And<br>he then went away to obey the command of the supreme Lord. The gods and<br>the Rishis also returned in delight to the place whence they had come.<br>And the Rishis began to perform as before their ceremonies and<br>sacrifices. And the gods in heaven and all creatures of the world<br>rejoiced exceedingly. And Agni too rejoiced in that he was free from the<br>prospect of sin.<br><br>"Thus, O possessor of the six attributes, had Agni been cursed in the<br>days of yore by Bhrigu. And such is the ancient history connected with<br>the destruction of the Rakshasa, Pauloma and the birth of Chyavana.'"<br><br>Thus endeth the seventh section of the Pauloma Parva of the Adi Parva of<br>the blessed Mahabharata.
