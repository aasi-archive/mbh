                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Soon after the monthly season of the princess of<br>Kosala had been over, Satyavati, purifying her daughter-in-law with a<br>bath, led her into the sleeping apartment. There seating her upon a<br>luxurious bed, she addressed her, saying, 'O Princess of Kosala, thy<br>husband hath an elder brother who shall this day enter thy womb as thy<br>child. Wait for him tonight without dropping off to sleep.' Hearing these<br>words of her mother-in-law, the amiable princess, as she lay on her bed,<br>began to think of Bhishma and the other elders of the Kuru race. Then the<br>Rishi of truthful speech, who had given his promise in respect of Amvika<br>(the eldest of the princesses) in the first instance, entered her chamber<br>while the lamp was burning. The princess, seeing his dark visage, his<br>matted locks of copper hue, blazing eyes, his grim beard, closed her eyes<br>in fear. The Rishi, from desire of accomplishing his mother's wishes,<br>however knew her. But the latter, struck with fear, opened not her eyes<br>even once to look at him. And when Vyasa came out, he was met by his<br>mother, who asked him, 'Shall the princess have an accomplished son?'<br>Hearing her, he replied, 'The son of the princess she will bring forth<br>shall be equal in might unto ten thousand elephants. He will be an<br>illustrious royal sage, possessed of great learning and intelligence and<br>energy. The high-souled one shall have in his time a century of sons. But<br>from the fault of his mother he shall be blind 'At these words of her<br>son, Satyavati said, 'O thou of ascetic wealth, how can one that is blind<br>become a monarch worthy of the Kurus? How can one that is blind become<br>the protector of his relatives and family, and the glory of his father's<br>race? It behoveth thee to give another king unto the Kurus.' Saying, 'So<br>be it,' Vyasa went away. And the first princess of Kosala in due time<br>brought forth a blind son.<br><br>"Soon after Satyavati, O chastiser of foes, summoned Vyasa, after having<br>secured the assent of her daughter-in-law. Vyasa came according to his<br>promise, and approached, as before, the second wife of his brother. And<br>Ambalika beholding the Rishi, became pale with fear And, O Bharata,<br>beholding her so afflicted and pale with fear, Vyasa addressed her and<br>said, 'Because thou hast been pale with fear at the sight of my grim<br>visage, therefore, thy child shall be pale in complexion. O thou of<br>handsome face, the name also thy child shall bear will be Pandu (the<br>pale).' 'Saying this, the illustrious and best of Rishis came out of her<br>chamber. And as he came out, he was met by his mother who asked him about<br>the would-be-child. The Rishi told her that the child would be of pale<br>complexion and known by the name of Pandu. Satyavati again begged of the<br>Rishi another child, and the Rishi told her in reply, 'So be it.'<br>Ambalika, then, when her time came, brought forth a son of pale<br>complexion. Blazing with beauty the child was endued with all auspicious<br>marks. Indeed, it was this child who afterwards became the father of<br>those mighty archers, the Pandavas.<br><br>"Some time after, when the oldest of Vichitravirya's widows again had her<br>monthly season, she was solicited by Satyavati to approach Vyasa once<br>again. Possessed of beauty like a daughter of a celestial, the princess<br>refused to do her mother-in-law's bidding, remembering the grim visage<br>and strong odour of the Rishi. She, however, sent unto him, a maid of<br>hers, endued with the beauty of an Apsara and decked with her own<br>ornaments. And when the Vyasa arrived, the maid rose up and saluted him.<br>And she waited upon him respectfully and took her seat near him when<br>asked. And, O king, the great Rishi of rigid vows, was well-pleased with<br>her, and when he rose to go away, he addressed her and said, 'Amiable<br>one, thou shalt no longer be a slave. Thy child also shall be greatly<br>fortunate and virtuous, and the foremost of all intelligent men on<br>earth!' And, O king, the son thus begotten upon her by Krishna-Dwaipayana<br>was afterwards known by the name of Vidura. He was thus the brother of<br>Dhritarashtra and the illustrious Pandu. And Vidura was free from desire<br>and passion and was conversant with the rules of government, and was the<br>god of justice born on earth under the curse of the illustrious Rishi<br>Mandavya. And Krishna-Dwaipayana, when he met his mother as before,<br>informed her as to how he had been deceived by the seniormost of the<br>princesses and how he had begotten a son upon a Sudra woman. And having<br>spoken thus unto his mother the Rishi disappeared from her sight.<br><br>"Thus were born, in the field of Vichitravirya, even of Dwaipayana those<br>sons of the splendour of celestial children, those propagators of the<br>Kuru race.'"
