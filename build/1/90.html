                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Ashtaka said, 'Capable of assuming any form at will, thou hast lived for<br>a million years in the gardens of Nandana. For what cause, O foremost of<br>those that flourished in the Krita age, hast thou been compelled to leave<br>that region and come hither?' Yayati answered, 'As kinsmen, friends, and<br>relatives forsake, in this world, those whose wealth disappears so, in<br>the other world, the celestials with Indra as their chief, forsake him<br>who hath lost his righteousness.' Ashtaka said, 'I am extremely anxious<br>to know how in the other world men can lose virtue. Tell me also, O king,<br>what regions are attainable by what courses of action. Thou art<br>acquainted, I know, with the acts and sayings of great beings."<br><br>"Yayati answered, 'O pious one, they that speak of their own merits are<br>doomed to suffer the hell called Bhauma. Though really emaciated and<br>lean, they appear to grow on Earth (in the shape of their sons and<br>grandsons) only to become food for vultures, dogs, and jackals.<br>Therefore, O king, this highly censurable and wicked vice should be<br>repressed. I have now, O king, told thee all. Tell me what more I shall<br>say.'<br><br>"Ashtaka said, 'When life is destroyed with age, vultures, peacocks,<br>insects, and worms eat up the human body. Where doth man then reside? How<br>doth he also come back to life? I have never heard of any hell called<br>Bhauma on Earth!'<br><br>"Yayati answered, 'After the dissolution of the body, man, according to<br>his acts, re-entereth the womb of his mother and stayeth there in an<br>indistinct form, and soon after assuming a distinct and visible shape<br>reappeareth in the world and walketh on its surface. This is that<br>Earth-hell (Bhauma) where he falleth, for he beholdeth not the<br>termination of his existence and acteth not towards his emancipation.<br>Some dwell for sixty thousand years, some, for eighty-thousand years in<br>heaven, and then they fall. And as they fall, they are attacked by<br>certain Rakshasas in the form of sons, grandsons, and other relatives,<br>that withdraw their hearts from acting for their own emancipation.'<br><br>"Ashtaka asked, 'For what sin are beings, when they fall from heaven,<br>attacked by these fierce and sharp-toothed Rakshasas? Why are they not<br>reduced to annihilation? How do they again enter the womb, furnished with<br>senses?'<br><br>"Yayati answered, 'After falling from heaven, the being becometh a<br>subtile substance living in water. This water becometh the semen whence<br>is the seed of vitality. Thence entering the mother's womb in the womanly<br>season, it developeth into the embryo and next into visible life like the<br>fruit from the flower. Entering trees, plants, and other vegetable<br>substances, water, air, earth, and space, that same watery seed of life<br>assumeth the quadrupedal or bipedal form. This is the case with all<br>creatures that you see.'<br><br>"Ashtaka said, 'O tell me, I ask thee because I have my doubts. Doth a<br>being that hath received a human form enter the womb in its own shape or<br>in some other? How doth it also acquire its distinct and visible shape,<br>eyes and ears and consciousness as well? Questioned by me, O, explain it<br>all! Thou art, O father, one acquainted with the acts and sayings of<br>great beings.' Yayati answered, 'According to the merits of one's acts,<br>the being that in a subtile form co-inheres in the seed that is dropped<br>into the womb is attracted by the atmospheric force for purposes of<br>re-birth. It then developeth there in course of time; first it becomes<br>the embryo, and is next provided with the visible physical organism.<br>Coming out of the womb in due course of time, it becometh conscious of<br>its existence as man, and with his ears becometh sensible of sound; with<br>his eyes, of colour and form; with his nose, of scent; with his tongue,<br>of taste; by his whole body, of touch; and by his mind, of ideas. It is<br>thus, O Ashtaka, that the gross and visible body developeth from the<br>subtile essence.'<br><br>"Ashtaka asked, 'After death, the body is burnt, or otherwise destroyed.<br>Reduced to nothing upon such dissolution, by what principle is one<br>revived?' Yayati said, 'O lion among kings, the person that dies assumes<br>a subtil form; and retaining consciousness of all his acts as in a dream,<br>he enters some other form with a speed quicker than that of air itself.<br>The virtuous attain to a superior, and the vicious to an inferior form of<br>existence. The vicious become worms and insects. I have nothing more to<br>say, O thou of great and pure soul! I have told thee how beings are born,<br>after development of embryonic forms, as four-footed, six-footed<br>creatures and others with more feet. What more wilt thou ask me?'<br><br>"Ashtaka said, 'How, O father, do men attain to those superior regions<br>whence there is no return to earthly life? Is it by asceticism or by<br>knowledge? How also can one gradually attain to felicitous regions? Asked<br>by me, O answer it in full.'<br><br>"Yayati answered, 'The wise say that for men there are seven gates<br>through which admission may be gained into Heaven. There are asceticism,<br>benevolence, tranquillity of mind, self-command, modesty, simplicity, and<br>kindness to all creatures. The wise also say that a person loseth all<br>these in consequence of vanity. That man who having acquired knowledge<br>regardeth himself as learned, and with his learning destroyed the<br>reputation of others, never attaineth to regions of indestructible<br>felicity. That knowledge also doth not make its possessor competent to<br>attain to Brahma. Study, taciturnity, worship before fire, and<br>sacrifices, these four remove all fear. When, however, these are mixed<br>with vanity, instead of removing it, they cause fear. The wise should<br>never exult at (receiving) honours nor should they grieve at insults. For<br>it is the wise alone that honour the wise; the wicked never act like the<br>virtuous. I have given away so much&#8212;I have performed so many<br>sacrifices,&#8212;I have studied so much,&#8212;I have observed these vows,&#8212;such<br>vanity is the root of fear. Therefore, thou must not indulge in such<br>feelings. Those learned men who accept as their support the unchangeable,<br>inconceivable Brahma alone that ever showereth blessings on persons<br>virtuous like thee, enjoy perfect peace here and hereafter.'"
