                            (Swayamvara Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed by the Brahmanas, the Pandavas, O<br>Janamejaya, proceeded towards the country of the southern Panchalas ruled<br>over by the king Drupada. And on their way those heroes beheld the<br>illustrious Dwaipayana&#8212;that Muni of pure soul, and perfectly sinless.<br>And duly saluting the Rishi and saluted by him, after their conversation<br>was over, commanded by him they proceeded to Drupada's abode. And those<br>mighty chariot-fighters proceeded by slow stages staying for some time<br>within those beautiful woods and by fine lakes that they beheld along<br>their way. Devoted to study, pure in their practices, amiable, and<br>sweet-speeched, the Pandavas at last entered the country of the<br>Panchalas. And beholding the capital, as also the fort, they took up<br>their quarters in the house of a potter, Adopting the Brahmanical<br>profession, they began to lead an eleemosynary life. And no men<br>recognised those heroes during their stay in Drupada's capital.<br><br>"Yajnasena always cherished the desire of bestowing his daughter on<br>Kiriti (Arjuna), the son of Pandu. But he never spoke of it to anybody.<br>And, O Janamejaya, the king of Panchala thinking of Arjuna caused a very<br>stiff bow to be made that was incapable of being bent by any except<br>Arjuna. Causing some machinery to be erected in the sky, the king set up<br>a mark attached to that machinery. And Drupada said, 'He that will string<br>this bow and with these well-adorned arrows shoot the mark above the<br>machine shall obtain my daughter.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'With these words king Drupada proclaimed the<br>Swayamvara. On hearing of them, O Bharata, the kings of other lands came<br>to his capital. And there came also many illustrious Rishis desirous of<br>beholding the Swayamvara. And there came also, O king, Duryodhana and the<br>Kurus accompanied by Kama. There also came many superior Brahmanas from<br>every country. And the monarchs who came there were all received with<br>reverence by the illustrious Drupada. Desirous of beholding the<br>Swayamvara, the citizens, roaring like the sea, all took their seats on<br>the platforms that were erected around the amphitheatre. The monarch<br>entered the grand amphitheatre by the north-eastern gate. And the<br>amphitheatre which itself had been erected on an auspicious and level<br>plain to the north-east of Drupada's capital, was surrounded by beautiful<br>mansions. And it was enclosed on all sides with high walls and a moat<br>with arched doorways here and there. The vast amphitheatre was also<br>shaded by a canopy of various colours. And resounding with the notes of<br>thousands of trumpets, it was scented with black aloes and sprinkled all<br>over with water mixed with sandal-paste and decorated with garlands of<br>flowers. It was surrounded with high mansions perfectly white and<br>resembling the cloud-kissing peaks of Kailasa. The windows of those<br>mansions were covered with net works of gold; the walls were set with<br>diamonds and precious costly carpets and cloths. All those mansions<br>adorned with wreaths and garlands of flowers and rendered fragrant with<br>excellent aloes, were all white and spotless, like unto the necks of<br>swans. And the fragrance therefrom could be perceived from the distance<br>of a Yojana (eight miles). And they were each furnished with a hundred<br>doors wide enough to admit a crowd of persons; they were adorned with<br>costly beds and carpets, and beautified with various metals; they<br>resembled the peaks of the Himavat. And in those seven-storied houses of<br>various sizes dwelt the monarchs invited by Drupada whose persons were<br>adorned with every ornament and who were possessed with the desire of<br>excelling one another. And the inhabitants of the city and the country<br>who had come to behold Krishna and taken their seats on the excellent<br>platforms erected around, beheld seated within those mansions those lions<br>among kings who were all endued with the energy of great souls. And those<br>exalted sovereigns were all adorned with the fragrant paste of the black<br>aloe. Of great liberality, they were all devoted to Brahma and they<br>protected their kingdoms against all foes. And for their own good deeds<br>they were loved by the whole world.<br><br>"The Pandavas, too, entering that amphitheatre, sat with the Brahmanas<br>and beheld the unequalled affluence of the king of the Panchalas. And<br>that concourse of princes, Brahmanas, and others, looking gay at the<br>performances of actors and dancers (large presents of every kind of<br>wealth being constantly made), began to swell day by day. And it lasted,<br>O king, several days, till on the sixteenth day when it was at its full,<br>the daughter of Drupada, O thou bull of the Bharata race, having washed<br>herself clean entered the amphitheatre, richly attired and adorned with<br>every ornament and bearing in her hand a dish of gold (whereon were the<br>usual offerings of Arghya) and a garland of flowers. Then the priest of<br>the lunar race&#8212;a holy Brahmana conversant with all mantras&#8212;ignited the<br>sacrificial fire and poured on it with due rites libations of clarified<br>butter. And gratifying Agni by these libations and making the Brahmanas<br>utter the auspicious formula of benediction, stopped the musical<br>instruments that were playing all around. And when that vast<br>amphitheatre, O monarch, became perfectly still, Dhrishtadyumna possessed<br>of a voice deep as the sound of the kettledrum or the clouds, taking hold<br>of his sister's arm, stood in the midst of that concourse, and said, with<br>a voice loud and deep as the roar of the clouds, these charming words of<br>excellent import, 'Hear ye assembled kings, this is the bow, that is the<br>mark, and these are the arrows. Shoot the mark through the orifice of the<br>machine with these five sharpened arrows. Truly do I say that, possessed<br>of lineage, beauty of persons, and strength whoever achieveth this great<br>feat shall obtain today this my sister, Krishna for his wife.' Having<br>thus spoken unto the assembled monarchs Drupada's son then addressed his<br>sister, reciting unto her the names and lineages and achievements of<br>those assembled lords of the earth.'"
