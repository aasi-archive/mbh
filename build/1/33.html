                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Santi said, 'And that bird, assuming a golden body bright as the rays of<br>the Sun, entered with great force (the region where the Soma was), like a<br>torrent entering the ocean. And he saw, placed near the Soma, a wheel of<br>steel keen-edged, and sharp as the razor, revolving incessantly. And that<br>fierce instrument, of the splendour of the blazing sun and of terrible<br>form, had been devised by the gods for cutting in pieces all robbers of<br>the Soma. Garuda, seeing a passage through it, stopped there for a<br>moment. Diminishing his body, in an instant he passed through the spokes<br>of that wheel. Within the line of the wheel, he beheld, stationed there<br>for guarding the Soma two great snakes of the effulgence of blazing fire,<br>with tongues bright as the lightning-flash, of great energy, with mouth<br>emitting fire, with blazing eyes, containing poison, very terrible,<br>always in anger, and of great activity. Their eyes were ceaselessly<br>inflamed with rage and were also winkless. He who may be seen by even one<br>of the two would instantly be reduced to ashes. The bird of fair feathers<br>suddenly covered their eyes with dust. And unseen by them he attacked<br>them from all sides. And the son of Vinata, that ranger of the skies,<br>attacking their bodies, mangled them into pieces. He then approached the<br>Soma without loss of time. Then the mighty son of Vinata, taking up the<br>Amrita from the place where it was kept, rose on his wings with great<br>speed, breaking into pieces the machine that had surrounded it. And the<br>bird soon came out, taking the Amrita but without drinking it himself.<br>And he then wended on his way without the least fatigue, darkening the<br>splendour of the Sun.<br><br>"And the son of Vinata then met Vishnu on his way along the sky. And<br>Narayana was gratified at that act of self-denial on the part of Garuda.<br>And that deity, knowing no deterioration, said unto the ranger of the<br>skies, 'O, I am inclined to grant thee a boon.' The ranger of the skies<br>thereupon said, 'I shall stay above thee.' And he again spake unto<br>Narayana these words, 'I shall be immortal and free from disease without<br>(drinking) Amrita.' Vishnu said unto the son of Vinata, 'Be it so.'<br>Garuda, receiving those two boons, told Vishnu, 'I also shall grant thee<br>a boon; therefore, let the possessor of the six attributes ask of me.'<br>Vishnu then asked the mighty Garuda to become his carrier. And he made<br>the bird sit on the flagstaff of his car, saying, 'Even thus thou shalt<br>stay above me.' And the ranger of the skies, of great speed, saying unto<br>Narayana, 'Be it so,' swiftly wended on his way, mocking the wind with<br>his fleetness.<br><br>"And while that foremost of all rangers of the skies, that first of<br>winged creatures, Garuda, was coursing through the air after wresting the<br>Amrita, Indra hurled at him his thunderbolt. Then Garuda, the lord of<br>birds, struck with thunderbolt, spake laughingly unto Indra engaged in<br>the encounter, in sweet words, saying, 'I shall respect the Rishi<br>(Dadhichi) of whose bone the Vajra hath been made. I shall also respect<br>the Vajra, and thee also of a thousand sacrifices. I cast this feather of<br>mine whose end thou shalt not attain. Struck with thy thunder I have not<br>felt the slightest pain.' And having said this, the king of birds cast a<br>feather of his. And all creatures became exceedingly glad, beholding that<br>excellent feather of Garuda so cast off. And seeing that the feather was<br>very beautiful, they said, 'Let this bird be called Suparna (having fair<br>feathers). And Purandara of a thousand eyes, witnessing this wonderful<br>incident, thought that bird to be some great being and addressed him<br>thus.'<br><br>"And Indra said, 'O best of birds, I desire to know the limit of thy<br>great strength. I also desire eternal friendship with thee.'"<br><br>So ends the thirty-third section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.
