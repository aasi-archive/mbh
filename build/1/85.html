                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'The excellent monarch Yayati, the son of Nahusha,<br>having received Puru's youth, became exceedingly gratified. And with it<br>he once more began to indulge in his favourite pursuits to the full<br>extent of his desires and to the limit of his powers, according to<br>seasons, so as to derive the greatest pleasure therefrom. And, O king, in<br>nothing that he did, he acted against the precepts of his religion as<br>behoved him well. He gratified the gods by his sacrifices; the pitris, by<br>Sraddhas; the poor, by his charities; all excellent Brahmanas, by<br>fulfilling their desires; all persons entitled to the rites of<br>hospitality, with food and drink; the Vaisyas, by protection; and the<br>Sudras, by kindness. And the king repressed all criminals by proper<br>punishments. And Yayati, gratifying all sections of his subjects,<br>protected them virtuously like another Indra. And the monarch possessed<br>of the prowess of a lion, with youth and every object of enjoyment under<br>control, enjoyed unlimited happiness without transgressing the precepts<br>of religion. And the king became very happy in thus being able to enjoy<br>all the excellent objects of his desires. And he was only sorry when he<br>thought that those thousand years would come to an end. And having<br>obtained youth for a thousand years, the king acquainted with the<br>mysteries of time, and watching proper Kalas and Kashthas sported with<br>(the celestial damsel) Viswachi, sometimes in the beautiful garden of<br>Indra, sometimes in Alaka (the city of Kuvera), and sometimes on the<br>summit of the mountain Meru on the north. And when the virtuous monarch<br>saw that the thousand years were full, he summoned his son, Puru, and<br>addressed him thus, 'O oppressor of foes, with thy youth, O son, I have<br>enjoyed the pleasures of life, each according to its season to the full<br>extent of my desires, to the limit of my powers. Our desires, however,<br>are never gratified by indulgence. On the other hand, with indulgence,<br>they only flame up like fire with libations of sacrificial butter. If a<br>single person were owner of everything on Earth&#8212;all her yields of paddy<br>and barley, her silver, gold, and gems, her animals and women, he would<br>not still be content. Thirst of enjoyment, therefore, should be given up.<br>Indeed, true happiness belongeth to them that have cast off their thirst<br>for worldly objects&#8212;a thirst which is difficult to be thrown off by the<br>wicked and the sinful, which faileth not with the failing life, and which<br>is truly the fatal disease of man. My heart hath for a full thousand<br>years been fixed upon the objects of desires. My thirst for these,<br>however, increaseth day by day without abating. Therefore, I shall cast<br>it off, and fixing my mind on Brahma I shall pass the rest of my days<br>with the innocent deer in the forest peacefully and with no heart for any<br>worldly objects. And O Puru, I have been exceedingly gratified with thee!<br>Prosperity be thine! Receive back this thy youth! Receive thou also my<br>kingdom. Thou art, indeed, that son of mine who has done me the greatest<br>services.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Yayati, the son of Nahusha, received back<br>his decrepitude. And his son Puru received back his own youth. And Yayati<br>was desirous of installing Puru, his youngest son, on the throne. But the<br>four orders, with the Brahmanas at their head, then addressed the monarch<br>thus, 'O king, how shall thou bestow thy kingdom on Puru, passing over<br>thy eldest son Yadu born of Devayani, and, therefore, the grandson of the<br>great Sukra? Indeed, Yadu is thy eldest son; after him hath been born<br>Turvasu; and of Sarmishtha's sons, the first is Drahyu, then Anu and then<br>Puru. How doth the youngest deserve the throne, passing all his elder<br>brothers over? This we represent to thee! O, conform to virtuous<br>practice.'<br><br>"Yayati then said, 'Ye four orders with Brahmanas at their head, hear my<br>words as to why my kingdom should not be given to my eldest son. My<br>commands have been disobeyed by my eldest son, Yadu. The wise say that he<br>is no son who disobeyeth his father. That son, however, who doth the<br>bidding of his parents, who seeketh their good, who is agreeable to them,<br>is indeed, the best of sons. I have been disregarded by Yadu and by<br>Turvasu, too. Much I have been disregarded by Drahyu and by Anu also. By<br>Puru alone hath my word been obeyed. By him have I been much regarded.<br>Therefore, the youngest shall be my heir. He took my decrepitude. Indeed,<br>Puru is my friend. He did what was so agreeable to me. It hath also been<br>commanded by Sukra himself, the son of Kavi, that, that son of mine who<br>should obey me will become king after me and bring the whole Earth under<br>his sway. I, therefore, beseech thee, let Puru be installed on the<br>throne.'<br><br>"The people then said, 'True it is, O king, that, that son who is<br>accomplished and who seeketh the good of his parents, deserveth<br>prosperity even if he be the youngest. Therefore, doth Puru, who hath<br>done the good, deserve the crown. And as Sukra himself hath commanded it,<br>we have nothing to say to it.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued., 'The son of Nahusha, thus addressed by the<br>contented people, then installed his son, Puru, on the throne. And having<br>bestowed his kingdom on Puru, the monarch performed the initiatory<br>ceremonies for retiring into the woods. And soon after he left his<br>capital, followed by Brahmanas and ascetics.<br><br>"The sons of Yadu are known by the name of the Yadavas: while those of<br>Turvasu have come to be called the Yavanas. And the sons of Drahyu are<br>the Bhojas, while those of Anu, the Mlechchhas. The progeny of Puru,<br>however, are the Pauravas, amongst whom, O monarch, thou art born, in<br>order to rule for a thousand years with thy passions under complete<br>control.'"
