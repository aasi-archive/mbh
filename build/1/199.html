                            (Vaivahika Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Vyasa continued, 'In days of yore, the celestials<br>had once commenced a grand sacrifice in the forest of Naimisha. At that<br>sacrifice, O king, Yama, the son of Vivaswat, became the slayer of the<br>devoted animals. Yama, thus employed in that sacrifice, did not (during<br>that period), O king, kill a single human being. Death being suspended in<br>the world, the number of human beings increased very greatly. Then Soma<br>and Sakra and Varuna and Kuvera, the Sadhyas, the Rudras, the Vasus, the<br>twin Aswins,&#8212;these and other celestials went unto Prajapati, the Creator<br>of the universe. Struck with fear for the increase of the human<br>population of the world they addressed the Master of creation and said,<br>'Alarmed, O lord, at the increase of human beings on earth, we come to<br>thee for relief. Indeed, we crave thy protection.' Hearing those words<br>the Grandsire said, 'Ye have little cause to be frightened at this<br>increase of human beings. Ye all are immortal. It behoveth you not to<br>take fright at human beings.' The celestials replied, 'The mortals have<br>all become immortal. There is no distinction now between us and them.<br>Vexed at the disappearance of all distinction, we have come to thee in<br>order that thou mayest distinguish us from them.' The Creator then said,<br>'The son of Vivaswat is even now engaged in the grand sacrifice. It is<br>for this that men are not dying. But when Yama's work in connection with<br>the sacrifice terminates, men will again begin to die as before.<br>Strengthened by your respective energies, Yama will, when that time<br>comes, sweep away by thousands the inhabitants on earth who will scarcely<br>have then any energy left in them.'<br><br>"Vyasa continued, 'Hearing these words of the first-born deity, the<br>celestials returned to the spot where the grand sacrifice was being<br>performed. And the mighty one sitting by the side of the Bhagirathi saw a<br>(golden) lotus being carried along by the current. And beholding that<br>(golden) lotus, they wondered much. And amongst them, that foremost of<br>celestials, viz., Indra, desirous of ascertaining whence it came,<br>proceeded up along the course of the Bhagirathi. And reaching that spot<br>whence the goddess Ganga issues perennially, Indra beheld a woman<br>possessing the splendour of fire. The woman who had come there to take<br>water was washing herself in the stream, weeping all the while. The<br>tear-drops she shed, falling on the stream, were being transformed into<br>golden lotuses. The wielder of the thunderbolt, beholding that wonderful<br>sight, approached the woman and asked her, 'Who art thou, amiable lady?<br>Why dost thou weep? I desire to know the truth. O, tell me everything.'<br><br>"Vyasa continued, 'The woman thereupon answered, 'O Sakra, thou mayest<br>know who I am and why, unfortunate that I am, I weep, if only, O chief of<br>the celestials, thou comest with me as I lead the way. Thou shall then<br>see what it is I weep for." Hearing these words of the lady, Indra<br>followed her as she led the way. And soon he saw, not far off from where<br>he was, a handsome youth with a young lady seated on a throne placed on<br>one of the peaks of Himavat and playing at dice. Beholding that youth,<br>the thief of the celestials said, 'Know, intelligent youth, that this<br>universe is under my sway.' Seeing, however, that the person addressed<br>was so engrossed in dice that he took no notice of what he said, Indra<br>was possessed by anger and repeated, 'I am the lord of the universe. The<br>youth who was none else than the god Mahadeva (the god of the gods),<br>seeing Indra filled with wrath, only smiled, having cast a glance at him.<br>At that glance, however, the chief of the celestials was at once<br>paralysed and stood there like a stake. When the game at dice was over,<br>Isana addressing the weeping woman said, 'Bring Sakra hither, for I shall<br>soon so deal with him that pride may not again enter his heart.' As soon<br>as Sakra was touched by that woman, the chief of the celestials with<br>limbs paralysed by that touch, fell down on the earth. The illustrious<br>Isana of fierce energy then said unto him, 'Act not, O Sakra, ever again<br>in this way. Remove this huge stone, for thy strength and energy are<br>immeasurable, and enter the hole (it will disclose) where await some<br>others possessing the splendour of the sun and who are all like unto<br>thee.' Indra, then, on removing that stone, beheld a cave in the breast<br>of that king of mountains, within which were four others resembling<br>himself. Beholding their plight, Sakra became seized with grief and<br>exclaimed, 'Shall I be even like these?' Then the god Girisha, looking<br>full at Indra with expanded eyes, said in anger, 'O thou of a hundred<br>sacrifices, enter this cave without loss of time, for thou hast from<br>folly insulted me.' Thus addressed by the lord Isana, the chief of the<br>celestials, in consequence of that terrible imprecation, was deeply<br>pained, and with limbs weakened by fear trembled like the wind-shaken<br>leaf of a Himalayan fig. And cursed unexpectedly by the god owning a bull<br>for his vehicle, Indra, with joined hands and shaking from head to foot,<br>addressed that fierce god of multi-form manifestations, saving, 'Thou<br>art, O Bhava, the over-looker of the infinite Universe!' Hearing these<br>words the god of fiery energy smiled and said, 'Those that are of<br>disposition like thine never obtain my grace. These others (within the<br>cave) had at one time been like thee. Enter thou this cave, therefore,<br>and lie there for some time. The fate of you all shall certainly be the<br>same. All of you shall have to take your birth in the world of men,<br>where, having achieved many difficult feats and slaying a large number of<br>men, ye shall again by the merits of your respective deeds, regain the<br>valued region of Indra. Ye shall accomplish all I have said and much more<br>besides, of other kinds of work.' Then those Indras, of their shorn glory<br>said, 'We shall go from our celestial regions even unto the region of men<br>where salvation is ordained to be difficult of acquisition. But let the<br>gods Dharma, Vayu, Maghavat, and the twin Aswins beget us upon our<br>would-be mother. Fighting with men by means of both celestial and human<br>weapons, we shall again come back into the region of Indra.'<br><br>"Vyasa continued, 'Hearing these words of the former Indras, the wielder<br>of the thunderbolt once more addressed that foremost of gods, saying,<br>'Instead of going myself, I shall, with a portion of my energy, create<br>from myself a person for the accomplishment of the task (thou assignest)<br>to form the fifth among these!' Vishwabhuk, Bhutadhaman, Sivi of great<br>energy, Santi the fourth, and Tejaswin, these it is said were the five<br>Indras of old. And the illustrious god of the formidable bow, from his<br>kindness, granted unto the five Indras the desire they cherished. And he<br>also appointed that woman of extraordinary beauty, who was none else than<br>celestial Sri (goddess of grace) herself, to be their common wife in the<br>world of men. Accompanied by all those Indras, the god Isana then went<br>unto Narayana of immeasurable energy, the Infinite, the Immaterial, the<br>Uncreate, the Old, the Eternal, and the Spirit of these universes without<br>limits. Narayana approved of everything. Those Indras then were born in<br>the world of men. And Hari (Narayana) took up two hairs from his body,<br>one of which hairs was black and the other white. And those two hairs<br>entered the wombs of two of the Yadu race, by name Devaki and Rohini. And<br>one of these hairs viz., that which was white, became Valadeva. And the<br>hair that was black was born as Kesava's self, Krishna. And those Indras<br>of old who had been confined in the cave on the Himavat are none else<br>than the sons of Pandu, endued with great energy. And Arjuna amongst the<br>Pandavas, called also Savyasachin (using both hands with equal dexterity)<br>is a portion of Sakra.'<br><br>"Vyasa continued, 'Thus, O king, they who have been born as the Pandavas<br>are none else than those Indras of old. And the celestial Sri herself who<br>had been appointed as their wife is this Draupadi of extraordinary<br>beauty. How could she whose effulgence is like that of the sun or the<br>moon, whose fragrance spreads for two miles around, take her birth in any<br>other than an extraordinary way, viz., from within the earth, by virtue<br>of the sacrificial rites? Unto thee, O king, I cheerfully grant this<br>other boon in the form of spiritual sight. Behold now the sons of Kunti<br>endued with their sacred and celestial bodies of old!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Saying this, that sacred Brahmana Vyasa of<br>generous deeds, by means of his ascetic power, granted celestial sight<br>unto the king. Thereupon the king beheld all the Pandavas endued with<br>their former bodies. And the king saw them possessed of celestial bodies,<br>with golden crowns and celestial garlands, and each resembling Indra<br>himself, with complexions radiant as fire or the sun, and decked with<br>every ornament, and handsome, and youthful, with broad chests and<br>statures measuring about five cubits. Endued with every accomplishment,<br>and decked with celestial robes of great beauty and fragrant garlands of<br>excellent making the king beheld them as so many three-eyed gods<br>(Mahadeva), or Vasus, or Rudras, or Adityas themselves. And observing the<br>Pandavas in the forms of those Indras of old, and Arjuna also in the form<br>of Indra sprung from Sakra himself, king Drupada was highly pleased. And<br>the monarch wondered much on beholding that manifestation of celestial<br>power under deep disguise. The king looking at his daughter, that<br>foremost of women endued with great beauty, like unto a celestial damsel<br>and possessed of the splendour of fire or the moon, regarded her as the<br>worthy wife of those celestial beings, for her beauty, splendour and<br>fame. And beholding that wonderful sight, the monarch touched the feet of<br>Satyavati's son, exclaiming, 'O great Rishi, nothing is miraculous in<br>thee!' The Rishi then cheerfully continued, 'In a certain hermitage there<br>was an illustrious Rishi's daughter, who, though handsome and chaste,<br>obtained not a husband. The maiden gratified, by severe ascetic penances,<br>the god Sankara (Mahadeva). The lord Sankara, gratified at her penances,<br>told her himself. 'Ask thou the boon thou desirest' Thus addressed, the<br>maiden repeatedly said unto the boon-giving Supreme Lord, 'I desire to<br>obtain a husband possessed of every accomplishment. Sankara, the chief of<br>the gods, gratified with her, gave her the boon she asked, saying, 'Thou<br>shall have, amiable maiden, five husbands.' The maiden, who had succeeded<br>in gratifying the god, said again, 'O Sankara, I desire to have from thee<br>only one husband possessed of every virtue?' The god of gods,<br>well-pleased with her, spake again, saying, 'Thou hast, O maiden,<br>addressed me five full times, repeating, 'Give me a husband.' Therefore,<br>O amiable one, it shall even be as thou hast asked. Blessed be thou. All<br>this, however, will happen in a future life of thine!'<br><br>"Vyasa continued, 'O Drupada, this thy daughter of celestial beauty is<br>that maiden. Indeed, the faultless Krishna sprung from Prishata's race<br>hath been pre-ordained to become the common wife of five husbands. The<br>celestial Sri, having undergone severe ascetic penances, hath, for the<br>sake of the Pandavas, had her birth as thy daughter, in the course of thy<br>grand sacrifice. That handsome goddess, waited upon by all the<br>celestials, as a consequence of her own acts becomes the (common) wife of<br>five husbands. It is for this that the self-create had created her.<br>Having listened to all this, O king Drupada, do what thou desirest.'"
