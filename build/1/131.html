                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Desirous of giving his grandsons a superior<br>education, Bhishma was on the look-out for a teacher endued with energy<br>and well-skilled in the science of arms. Deciding, O chief of the<br>Bharatas, that none who was not possessed of great intelligence, none who<br>was not illustrious or a perfect master of the science of arms, none who<br>was not of godlike might, should be the instructor of the Kuru (princes),<br>the son of Ganga, O tiger among men, placed the Pandavas and the Kauravas<br>under the tuition of Bharadwaja's son, the intelligent Drona skilled in<br>all the Vedas. Pleased with the reception given him by the great Bhishma,<br>that foremost of all men skilled in arms, viz., illustrious Drona of<br>world-wide fame, accepted the princes as his pupils. And Drona taught<br>them the science of arms in all its branches. And, O monarch, both the<br>Kauravas and the Pandavas endued with immeasurable strength, in a short<br>time became proficient in the use of all kinds of arms.'<br><br>"Janamejaya asked, 'O Brahmana, how was Drona born? How and whence did he<br>acquire his arms? How and why came he unto the Kurus? Whose son also was<br>he endued with such energy? Again, how was his son Aswatthaman, the<br>foremost of all skilled in arms born? I wish to hear all this! Please<br>recite them in detail.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'There dwelt at the source of the Ganga, a great sage<br>named Bharadwaja, ceaselessly observing the most rigid vows. One day, of<br>old, intending to celebrate the Agnihotra sacrifice he went along with<br>many great Rishis to the Ganga to perform his ablutions. Arrived at the<br>bank of the stream, he saw Ghritachi herself, that Apsara endued with<br>youth and beauty, who had gone there a little before. With an expression<br>of pride in her countenance, mixed with a voluptuous languor of attitude,<br>the damsel rose from the water after her ablutions were over. And as she<br>was gently treading on the bank, her attire which was loose became<br>disordered. Seeing her attire disordered, the sage was smitten with<br>burning desire. The next moment his vital fluid came out, in consequence<br>of the violence of his emotion. The Rishi immediately held it in a vessel<br>called a drona. Then, O king, Drona sprang from the fluid thus preserved<br>in that vessel by the wise Bharadwaja. And the child thus born studied<br>all the Vedas and their branches. Before now Bharadwaja of great prowess<br>and the foremost of those possessing a knowledge of arms, had<br>communicated to the illustrious Agnivesa, a knowledge of the weapon<br>called Agneya. O foremost one of Bharata's race, the Rishi (Agnivesa)<br>sprung from fire now communicated the knowledge of that great weapon to<br>Drona the son of his preceptor.<br><br>"There was a king named Prishata who was a great friend of Bharadwaja.<br>About this time Prishata had a son born unto him, named Drupada. And that<br>bull among Kshatriyas, viz., Drupada, the son of Prishata, used every day<br>to come to the hermitage of Bharadwaja to play with Drona and study in<br>his company. O monarch, when Prishata was dead, this Drupada of mighty<br>arms became the king of the northern Panchalas. About this time the<br>illustrious Bharadwaja also ascended to heaven. Drona continuing to<br>reside in his father's hermitage devoted himself to ascetic austerities.<br>Having become well-versed in the Vedas and their branches and having<br>burnt also all his sins by asceticism, the celebrated Drona, obedient to<br>the injunctions of his father and moved by the desire of offspring<br>married Kripi, the daughter of Saradwat. And this woman, ever engaged in<br>virtuous acts and the Agnihotra, and the austerest of penances, obtained<br>a son named Aswatthaman. And as soon as Aswatthaman was born, he neighed<br>like the (celestial) steed Ucchaihsravas. Hearing that cry, an invisible<br>being in the skies said, 'The voice of this child hath, like the neighing<br>of a horse, been audible all around. The child shall, therefore, be known<br>by the name of Aswatthaman, (the horse-voiced). The son of Bharadwaja<br>(Drona) was exceedingly glad at having obtained that child. Continuing to<br>reside in that hermitage he devoted himself to the study of the science<br>of arms.<br><br>"O king, it was about this time that Drona heard that the illustrious<br>Brahmana Jamadagnya, that slayer of foes, that foremost one among all<br>wielders of weapons, versed in all kinds of knowledge, had expressed a<br>desire of giving away all his wealth to Brahmanas. Having heard of Rama's<br>knowledge of arms and of his celestial weapons also, Drona set his heart<br>upon them as also upon the knowledge of morality that Rama possessed.<br>Then Drona of mighty arms, endued with high ascetic virtues, accompanied<br>by disciples who were all devoted to vows ascetic austerities, set out<br>for the Mahendra mountains. Arrived at Mahendra, the son of Bharadwaja<br>possessed of high ascetic merit, beheld the son of Bhrigu, the<br>exterminator of all foes, endued with great patience and with mind under<br>complete control. Then, approaching with his disciples that scion of the<br>Bhrigu race Drona, giving him his name, told him of his birth in the line<br>of Angiras. And touching the ground with his head, he worshipped Rama's<br>feet. And beholding the illustrious son of Jamadagni intent upon retiring<br>into the woods after having given away all his wealth, Drona said, 'Know<br>me to have sprung from Bharadwaja, but not in any woman's womb! I am a<br>Brahmana of high birth, Drona by name, come to thee with the desire of<br>obtaining thy wealth.'<br><br>"On hearing him, that illustrious grinder of the Kshatriya race replied,<br>Thou art welcome, O best of regenerate ones! Tell me what thou desirest.<br>Thus addressed by Rama, the son of Bharadwaja replied unto that foremost<br>of all smiters, desirous of giving away the whole of his wealth, 'O thou<br>of multifarious vows, I am a candidate for thy eternal wealth,' 'O thou<br>of ascetic wealth, returned Rama, 'My gold and whatever other wealth I<br>had, have all been given away unto Brahmanas! This earth also, to the<br>verge of the sea, decked with towns and cities, as with a garland of<br>flowers, I have given unto Kasyapa. I have now my body only and my<br>various valuable weapons left. I am prepared to give either my body or my<br>weapons. Say, which thou wouldst have! I would give it thee! Say quickly!'<br><br>"Drona answered, O son of Bhrigu, it behoveth thee to give me all thy<br>weapons together with the mysteries of hurling and recalling them.'<br><br>"Saying, 'So be it,' the son of Bhrigu gave all his weapons unto<br>Drona,&#8212;indeed, the whole science of arms with its rules and mysteries.<br>Accepting them all, and thinking himself amply rewarded that best of<br>Brahmanas then, glad at heart, set out, for (the city of) his friend<br>Drupada.'"
