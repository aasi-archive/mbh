                            (Vaka-vadha Parva continued)<br><br>"Having heard these words of his mother, Yudhishthira said, 'What thou, O<br>mother, hast deliberately done, moved by compassion for the afflicted<br>Brahmana, is, indeed, excellent Bhima will certainly come back with life,<br>after having slain the cannibal, inasmuch as thou art, O mother, always<br>compassionate unto Brahmanas. But tell the Brahmana, O mother, that he<br>doth not do anything whereby the dwellers in this town may know all about<br>it, and make him promise to keep thy request.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then, when the night passed away, Bhimasena,<br>the son of Pandu, taking with him the Rakshasa's food set out for the<br>place where the cannibal lived. The mighty son of Pandu, approaching the<br>forest where the Rakshasa dwelt, began to eat himself the food he<br>carried, calling loudly to the Rakshasa by name. The Rakshasa, inflamed<br>with anger at Bhima's words, came out and approached the place where<br>Bhima was.<br><br>"Of huge body and great strength, of red eyes, red beard, and red hair,<br>he was terrible to behold, and he came, pressing deep the earth with his<br>tread. The opening of his mouth, was from ear to ear and his ears<br>themselves were straight as arrows. Of grim visage, he had a forehead<br>furrowed into three lines. Beholding Bhima eating his food, the Rakshasa<br>advanced, biting his nether lip and expanding his eyes in wrath. And<br>addressing Bhima he said, 'Who is this fool, who desiring to go to the<br>abode of Yama, eateth in my very sight the food intended for me?' Hearing<br>these words, Bhima, O Bharata, smiled in derision and disregarding the<br>Rakshasa, continued eating with averted face. Beholding this, the<br>cannibal uttered a frightful yell and with both arms upraised ran at<br>Bhima desiring to kill him, there and then. Even then disregarding the<br>Rakshasa and casting only a single glance at him, Vrikodara, that slayer<br>of hostile heroes continued to eat the Rakshasa's food. Filled with wrath<br>at this, the Rakshasa struck, from behind with both his arms a heavy blow<br>on the back of Vrikodara, the son of Kunti. But Bhima, though struck<br>heavily by the mighty Rakshasa, with both his hands, did not even look up<br>at the Rakshasa but continued to eat as before. Then the mighty Rakshasa,<br>inflamed with wrath, tore up a tree and ran at Bhima for striking him<br>again. Meanwhile the mighty Bhima, that bull among men had leisurely<br>eaten up the whole of that food and washing himself stood cheerfully for<br>fight. Then, O Bharata, possessed of great energy, Bhima, smiling in<br>derision, caught with his left hand the tree hurled at him by the<br>Rakshasa in wrath. Then that mighty Rakshasa, tearing up many more trees,<br>hurled them at Bhima, and the Pandava also hurled as many at the<br>Rakshasa. Then, O king, the combat with trees between that human being<br>and the Rakshasa, became so terrible that the region around soon became<br>destitute of trees. Then the Rakshasa, saying that he was none else than<br>Vaka, sprang upon the Pandava and seized the mighty Bhima with his arms.<br>That mighty hero also clasping with his own strong arms the strong-armed<br>Rakshasa, and exerting himself actively, began to drag him violently.<br>Dragged by Bhima and dragging Bhima also, the cannibal was overcome with<br>great fatigue. The earth began to tremble in consequence of the strength<br>they both exerted, and large trees that stood there broke in pieces. Then<br>Bhima, beholding the cannibal overcome with fatigue, pressed him down on<br>the earth with his knees and began to strike him with great force. Then<br>placing one knee on the middle of the Rakshasa's back, Bhima seized his<br>neck with his right hand and the cloth on his waist with his left, and<br>bent him double with great force. The cannibal then roared frightfully.<br>And, O monarch, he also began to vomit blood while he was being thus<br>broken on Bhima's knee.'"
