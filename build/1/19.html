                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Then the Daityas and the Danauas equipped with first-class<br>armours and various weapons attacked the gods. In the meantime the<br>valiant Lord Vishnu in the form of an enchantress accompanied by Nara<br>deceived the mighty Danavas and took away the Amrita from their hands.<br><br>"And all the gods at that time of great fright drank the Amrita with<br>delight, receiving it from Vishnu. And while the gods were partaking of<br>it, after which they had so much hankered, a Danava named Rahu was also<br>drinking it among them in the guise of a god. And when the Amrita had<br>reached Rahu's throat only, Surya and Soma (recognised him and) intimated<br>the fact to the gods. And Narayana instantly cut off with his discus the<br>well-adorned head of the Danava who was drinking the Amrita without<br>permission. And the huge head of the Danava, cut off by the discus and<br>resembling a mountain peak, then rose up to the sky and began to utter<br>dreadful cries. And the Danava's headless trunk, falling upon the ground<br>and rolling thereon, made the Earth tremble with her mountains, forests<br>and islands. And from that time there is a long-standing quarrel between<br>Rahu's head and Surya and Soma. And to this day it swalloweth Surya and<br>Soma (during solar and lunar eclipses).<br><br>"Then Narayana quitting his enchanting female form and hurling many<br>terrible weapons at the Danavas, made them tremble. And thus on the<br>shores of the salt-water sea, commenced the dreadful battle of the gods<br>and the Asuras. And sharp-pointed javelins and lances and various weapons<br>by thousands began to be discharged on all sides. And mangled with the<br>discus and wounded with swords, darts and maces, the Asuras in large<br>numbers vomited blood and lay prostrate on the earth. Cut off from the<br>trunks with sharp double-edged swords, heads adorned with bright gold,<br>fell continually on the field of battle. Their bodies drenched in gore,<br>the great Asuras lay dead everywhere. It seemed as if red-dyed mountain<br>peaks lay scattered all around. And when the Sun rose in his splendour,<br>thousands of warriors struck one another with weapons. And cries of<br>distress were heard everywhere. The warriors fighting at a distance from<br>one another brought one another down by sharp iron missiles, and those<br>fighting at close quarters slew one another with blows of their fists.<br>And the air was filled with shrieks of distress. Everywhere were heard<br>the alarming sounds,&#8212;'cut', 'pierce', 'at them', 'hurl down', 'advance'.<br><br>'And when the battle was raging fiercely, Nara and Narayana entered the<br>field. And Narayana seeing the celestial bow in the hand of Nara, called<br>to mind his own weapon, the Danava-destroying discus. And lo! the discus,<br>Sudarsana, destroyer of enemies, like to Agni in effulgence and dreadful<br>in battle, came from the sky as soon as thought of. And when it came,<br>Narayana of fierce energy, possessing arms like the trunk of an elephant,<br>hurled with great force that weapon of extraordinary lustre, effulgent as<br>blazing fire, dreadful and capable of destroying hostile towns. And that<br>discus blazing like the fire that consumeth all things at the end of<br>Yuga, hurled with force from the hands of Narayana, and falling<br>constantly everywhere, destroyed the Daityas and the Danavas by<br>thousands. Sometimes it blazed like fire and consumed them all; sometimes<br>it struck them down as it coursed through the sky; and sometimes, falling<br>on the earth, it drank their life-blood like a goblin.<br><br>"On the other hand, the Danavas, white as the clouds from which the rain<br>hath dropped, possessing great strength and bold hearts, ascended the<br>sky, and by hurling down thousands of mountains, continually harassed the<br>gods. And those dreadful mountains, like masses of clouds, with their<br>trees and flat tops, falling from the sky, collided with one another and<br>produced a tremendous roar. And when thousands of warriors shouted<br>without intermission in the field of battle and mountains with the woods<br>thereon began to fall around, the earth with her forests trembled. Then<br>the divine Nara appeared at the scene of the dreadful conflict between<br>the Asuras and the Ganas (the followers of Rudra), and reducing to dust<br>those rocks by means of his gold-headed arrows, he covered the heavens<br>with dust. Thus discomfited by the gods, and seeing the furious discus<br>scouring the fields of heaven like a blazing flame, the mighty Danavas<br>entered the bowels of the earth, while others plunged into the sea of<br>salt-waters.<br><br>"And having gained the victory, the gods offered due respect to Mandara<br>and placed him again on his own base. And the nectar-bearing gods made<br>the heavens resound with their shouts, and went to their own abodes. And<br>the gods, on returning to the heavens, rejoiced greatly, and Indra and<br>the other deities made over to Narayana the vessel of Amrita for careful<br>keeping.'"<br><br>And so ends the nineteenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.
