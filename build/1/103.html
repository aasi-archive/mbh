                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'The unfortunate Satyavati then became plunged in<br>grief on account of her son. And after performing with her<br>daughters-in-law the funeral rites of the deceased, consoled, as best she<br>could, her weeping daughters-in-law and Bhishma, that foremost of all<br>wielders of weapons. And turning her eyes to religion, and to the<br>paternal and maternal lines (of the Kurus), she addressed Bhishma and<br>said 'The funeral cake, the achievements, and the perpetuation of the<br>line of the virtuous and celebrated Santanu of Kuru's race, all now<br>depend on thee. As the attainment of heaven is inseparable from good<br>deeds, as long life is inseparable from truth and faith, so is virtue<br>inseparable from thee. O virtuous one, thou art well-acquainted, in<br>detail and in the abstract, with the dictates of virtue, with various<br>Srutis, and with all the branches of the Vedas; know very well that thou<br>art equal unto Sukra and Angiras as regards firmness in virtue, knowledge<br>of the particular customs of families, and readiness of inventions under<br>difficulties. Therefore, O foremost of virtuous men, relying on thee<br>greatly, I shall appoint thee in a certain matter. Hearing me, it<br>behoveth thee to do my bidding. O bull among men, my son and thy brother,<br>endued with energy and dear unto thee, hath gone childless to heaven<br>while still a boy. These wives of thy brother, the amiable daughters of<br>the ruler of Kasi, possessing beauty and youth, have become desirous of<br>children. Therefore, O thou of mighty arms, at my command, raise<br>offspring on them for the perpetuation of our line. It behoveth thee to<br>guard virtue against loss. Install thyself on the throne and rule the<br>kingdom of the Bharatas. Wed thou duly a wife. Plunge not thy ancestors<br>into hell.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by his mother and friends and<br>relatives, that oppressor of foes, the virtuous Bhishma, gave this reply<br>conformable to the dictates of virtue, 'O mother, what thou sayest is<br>certainly sanctioned by virtue. But thou knowest what my vow is in the<br>matter of begetting children. Thou knowest also all that transpired in<br>connection with thy dower. O Satyavati, I repeat the pledge I once gave,<br>viz., I would renounce three worlds, the empire of heaven, anything that<br>may be greater than that, but truth I would never renounce. The earth may<br>renounce its scent, water may renounce its moisture, light may renounce<br>its attribute of exhibiting forms, air may renounce its attribute of<br>touch, the sun may renounce his glory, fire, its heat, the moon, his<br>cooling rays, space, its capacity of generating sound, the slayer of<br>Vritra, his prowess, the god of justice, his impartiality; but I cannot<br>renounce truth.' Thus addressed by her son endued with wealth of energy,<br>Satyavati said unto Bhishma, 'O thou whose prowess is truth, I know of<br>thy firmness in truth. Thou canst, if so minded, create, by the help of<br>thy energy, three worlds other than those that exist. I know what thy vow<br>was on my account. But considering this emergency, bear thou the burden<br>of the duty that one oweth to his ancestors. O punisher of foes, act in<br>such a way that the lineal link may not be broken and our friends and<br>relatives may not grieve.' Thus urged by the miserable and weeping<br>Satyavati speaking such words inconsistent with virtue from grief at the<br>loss of her son, Bhishma addressed her again and said, 'O Queen, turn not<br>thy eyes away from virtue. O, destroy us not. Breach of truth by a<br>Kshatriya is never applauded in our treatises on religion. I shall soon<br>tell thee, O Queen, what the established Kshatriya usage is to which<br>recourse may be had to prevent Santanu's line becoming extinct on earth.<br>Hearing me, reflect on what should be done in consultation with learned<br>priests and those that are acquainted with practices allowable in times<br>of emergency and distress, forgetting not at the same time what the<br>ordinary course of social conduct is.'"
