                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>'Sauti continued, 'Garuda then said, 'O Purandara, let there be<br>friendship between thee and me as thou desirest. My strength, know thou,<br>is hard to bear. O thou of a thousand sacrifices, the good never approve<br>of speaking highly of their own strength, nor do they speak of their own<br>merits. But being made a friend, and asked by thee, O friend, I will<br>answer thee, although self-praise without reason is ever improper. I can<br>bear, on a single feather of mine, O Sakra, this Earth, with her<br>mountains and forests and with the waters of the ocean, and with thee<br>also stationed thereon. Know thou, my strength is such that I can bear<br>without fatigue even all the worlds put together, with their mobile and<br>immobile objects.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'O Saunaka, after Garuda of great courage had thus<br>spoken, Indra the chief of the gods, the wearer of the (celestial) crown,<br>ever bent upon the good of the worlds, replied, saying, 'It is as thou<br>sayest. Everything is possible in thee. Accept now my sincere and hearty<br>friendship. And if thou hast no concern with the Soma, return it to me.<br>Those to whom thou wouldst give it would always oppose us.' Garuda<br>answered, 'There is a certain reason for which the Soma is being carried<br>by me. I shall not give the Soma to any one for drink. But, O thou of a<br>thousand eyes, after I have placed it down, thou, O lord of the heavens,<br>canst then, taking it up, instantly bring it away.' Indra then said, 'O<br>oviparous one, I am highly gratified with these words now spoken by thee.<br>O best of all rangers of the skies; accept from me any boon that thou<br>desirest.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Then Garuda, recollecting the sons of Kadru and<br>remembering also the bondage of his mother caused by an act of deception<br>owing to the well-known reason (viz., the curse of Aruna), said,<br>'Although I have power over all creatures, yet I shall do your bidding.<br>Let, O Sakra, the mighty snakes become my food.' The slayer of the<br>Danavas having said unto him, 'Be it so,' then went to Hari, the god of<br>gods, of great soul, and the lord of Yogins. And the latter sanctioned<br>everything that had been said by Garuda. And the illustrious lord of<br>heaven again said unto Garuda, 'I shall bring away the Soma when thou<br>placest it down.' And having said so, he bade farewell to Garuda. And the<br>bird of fair feathers then went to the presence of his mother with great<br>speed.<br><br>"And Garuda in joy then spake unto all the snakes, 'Here have I brought<br>the Amrita. Let me place it on some Kusa grass. O ye snakes, sitting<br>here, drink of it after ye have performed your ablutions and religious<br>rites. As said by you, let my mother become, from this day, free, for I<br>have accomplished your bidding.' The snakes having said unto Garuda, 'Be<br>it so,' then went to perform their ablutions. Meanwhile, Sakra taking up<br>the Amrita, wended back to heaven. The snakes after performing their<br>ablutions, their daily devotions, and other sacred rites, returned in<br>joy, desirous of drinking the Amrita. They saw that the bed of kusa grass<br>whereon the Amrita had been placed was empty, the Amrita itself having<br>been taken away by a counter-act of deception. And they began to lick<br>with their tongues the kusa grass, as the Amrita had been placed thereon.<br>And the tongues of the snakes by that act became divided in twain. And<br>the kusa grass, too, from the contact with Amrita, became sacred<br>thenceforth. Thus did the illustrious Garuda bring Amrita (from the<br>heavens) for the snakes, and thus were the tongues of snakes divided by<br>what Garuda did.<br><br>"Then the bird of fair feathers, very much delighted, enjoyed himself in<br>those woods accompanied by his mother. Of grand achievements, and deeply<br>reverenced by all rangers of the skies, he gratified his mother by<br>devouring the snakes.<br><br>"That man who would listen to this story, or read it out to an assembly<br>of good Brahmanas, must surely go to heaven, acquiring great merit from<br>the recitation of (the feats of) Garuda.'"<br><br>And so ends the thirty-fourth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi<br>Parva.
