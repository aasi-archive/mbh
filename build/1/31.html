                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Saunaka said, 'O son of Suta, what was Indra's fault, what his act of<br>carelessness? How was Garuda born in consequence of the ascetic penances<br>of the Valakhilyas? Why also Kasyapa&#8212;a Brahman&#8212;had the king of birds<br>for a son? Why, too, was he invincible of all creatures and unslayable of<br>all? Why also was that ranger of the skies capable of going into every<br>place at will and of mustering at will any measure of energy? If these<br>are described in the Purana, I should like to hear them.'<br><br>"Sauti said, 'What thou askest me is, indeed, the subject of the Purana.<br>O twice-born one, listen as I briefly recite it all.<br><br>"Once upon a time, when the lord of creation, Kasyapa, was engaged in a<br>sacrifice from desire of offspring, the Rishis, the gods, and the<br>Gandharvas, all gave him help. And Indra was appointed by Kasyapa to<br>bring the sacrificial fuel; and with him those ascetics the Valakhilyas,<br>and all the other deities. And the lord Indra, taking up according to his<br>own strength, a weight that was mountain-like, brought it without any<br>fatigue. And he saw on the way some Rishis, of bodies of the measure of<br>the thumb, all together carrying one single stalk of a Palasa (Butea<br>frondosa) leaf. And those Rishis were, from want of food, very lean and<br>almost merged in their own bodies. And they were so weak that they were<br>much afflicted when sunk in the water that collected in an indentation on<br>the road produced by the hoof of a cow. And Purandara, proud of his<br>strength, beheld them with surprise, and laughing at them in derision<br>soon left them behind insulting them, besides, by passing over their<br>heads. And those Rishis being thus insulted were filled with rage and<br>sorrow. And they made preparations for a great sacrifice at which Indra<br>was terrified. Hear, O Saunaka, of the wish for accomplishment of which<br>those vow-observing wise, and excellent ascetics poured clarified butter<br>of the sacrificial fire with loudly uttered mantras, 'There shall be<br>another Indra of all gods, capable of going everywhere at will, and of<br>mustering at will any measure of energy, and striking tear into the<br>(present) king of the gods. By the fruit of our ascetic penance, let one<br>arise, fleet as the mind, and fierce withal.' And the lord of the<br>celestials of a hundred sacrifices, having come to know of this, became<br>very much alarmed and sought the protection of the vow-observing Kasyapa.<br>And the Prajapati Kasyapa, hearing everything from Indra, went to the<br>Valakhilyas and asked them if their sacrifice had been successful. And<br>those truth-speaking Rishis replied to him, saying, 'Let it be as thou<br>sayest!' And the Prajapati Kasyapa pacifying them, spake unto them as<br>follows, 'By the word of Brahman, this one (Indra) hath been made the<br>Lord of the three worlds. Ye ascetics, ye also are striving to create<br>another Indra! Ye excellent ones, it behoveth you not to falsify the word<br>of Brahman. Let not also this purpose, for (accomplishing) which ye are<br>striving, be rendered futile. Let there spring an Indra (Lord) of winged<br>creatures, endued with excess of strength! Be gracious unto Indra who is<br>a suppliant before you.' And the Valakhilyas, thus addressed by Kasyapa,<br>after offering reverence to that first of the Munis, viz., the Prajapati<br>Kasyapa, spake unto him:<br><br>"The Valakhilyas said, 'O Prajapati, this sacrifice of us all is for an<br>Indra! Indeed this hath also been meant for a son being born unto thee!<br>Let this task be now left to thee. And in this matter do whatsoever thou<br>seest to be good and proper.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Meanwhile, moved by the desire of offspring, the good<br>daughter of Daksha, the vow-observing, amiable, and fortunate Vinata, her<br>ascetic penances over, having purified herself with a bath in that season<br>when connubial companionship might prove fruitful, approached her lord.<br>And Kasyapa spake unto her, 'Respected one, the sacrifice commenced by me<br>hath borne fruit. What hath been desired by thee shall come to pass. Two<br>heroic sons, shall be born unto thee, who shall be the lords of the three<br>worlds. By the penances of the Valakhilyas and by virtue of the desire<br>with which I commenced my sacrifice, those sons shall be of exceedingly<br>good fortune and worshipped in the three worlds!' And the illustrious<br>Kasyapa spake unto her again, 'Bear thou these auspicious seeds with<br>great care. These two will be the lords of all winged creatures. These<br>heroic rangers of the skies will be respected in all the worlds, and<br>capable of assuming any form at will.<br><br>"And the Prajapati, gratified with all that took place, then addressed<br>Indra of a hundred sacrifices, saying, 'Thou shalt have two brothers of<br>great energy and prowess, who shall be to thee even as the helpmates.<br>From them no injury shall result unto thee. Let thy sorrow cease; thou<br>shalt continue as the lord of all. Let not, however, the utterers of the<br>name of Brahma be ever again slighted by thee. Nor let the very wrathful<br>ones, whose words are even the thunderbolt, be ever again insulted by<br>thee. Indra, thus addressed, went to heaven, his fears dispelled. And<br>Vinata also, her purpose fulfilled, was exceedingly glad. And she gave<br>birth to two sons, Aruna and Garuda. And Aruna, of undeveloped body,<br>became the fore-runner of the Sun. And Garuda was vested with the<br>lordship over the birds. O thou of Bhrigu's race, hearken now to the<br>mighty achievement of Garuda.'"<br><br>"So ends the thirty-first section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.
