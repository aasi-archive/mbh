                            (Hidimva-vadha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Hidimva, the chief of the Rakshasas, seeing that his<br>sister returned not soon enough, alighted from the tree, proceeded<br>quickly to the spot where the Pandavas were. Of red eyes and strong arms<br>and the arms and the hair of his head standing erect, of large open mouth<br>and body like unto a mass of dark clouds, teeth long and sharp-pointed,<br>he was terrible to behold. And Hidimva, beholding her brother of<br>frightful visage alight from the tree, became very much alarmed, and<br>addressing Bhima said, 'The wicked cannibal is coming hither in wrath. I<br>entreat thee, do with thy brothers, as I bid thee. O thou of great<br>courage, as I am endued with the powers of a Rakshasa, I am capable of<br>going whithersoever I like. Mount ye on my hips, I will carry you all<br>through the skies. And, O chastiser of foes, awaken these and thy mother<br>sleeping in comfort. Taking them all on my body, I will convey you<br>through the skies.'<br><br>"Bhima then said, 'O thou of fair hips, fear not anything. I am sure that<br>as long as I am here, there is no Rakshasa capable of injuring any of<br>these, O thou of slender waist. I will slay this (cannibal) before thy<br>very eyes. This worst of Rakshasas, O timid one, is no worthy antagonist<br>of mine, nor can all the Rakshasas together bear the strength of my arms.<br>Behold these strong arms of mine, each like unto the trunk of an<br>elephant. Behold also these thighs of mine like unto iron maces, and this<br>broad and adamantine chest. O beautiful one, thou shall today behold my<br>prowess like unto that of Indra. O thou of fair hips, hate me not,<br>thinking that I am a man.'<br><br>"Hidimva replied saying, 'O tiger among men, O thou of the beauty of a<br>celestial, I do not certainly hold thee in contempt. But I have seen the<br>prowess that Rakshasas exert upon men.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then, O Bharata, the wrathful Rakshasa eating<br>human flesh heard these words of Bhima who had been talking in that way.<br>And Hidimva beheld his sister disguised in human form, her head decked<br>with garlands of flowers and her face like the full moon and her eyebrows<br>and nose and eyes and ringlets all of the handsomest description, and her<br>nails and complexion of the most delicate hue, and herself wearing every<br>kind of ornament and attired in fine transparent robes. The cannibal,<br>beholding her in that charming human form, suspected that she was<br>desirous of carnal intercourse and became indignant. And, O best of the<br>Kurus, becoming angry with his sister, the Rakshasa dilated his eyes and<br>addressing her said, 'What senseless creature wishes to throw obstacles<br>in my path now that I am so hungry? Hast thou become so senseless, O<br>Hidimva, that thou fearest not my wrath? Fie on thee, thou unchaste<br>woman! Thou art even now desirous of carnal intercourse and solicitous of<br>doing me an injury. Thou art ready to sacrifice the good name and honour<br>of all the Rakshasas, thy ancestors! Those with whose aid thou wouldst do<br>me this great injury, I will, even now, slay along with thee.' Addressing<br>his sister thus, Hidimva, with eyes red with anger and teeth pressing<br>against teeth, ran at her to kill her then and there. But beholding him<br>rush at his sister, Bhima, that foremost of smiter, endued with great<br>energy, rebuked him and said, Stop&#8212;Stop!"<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'And Bhima, beholding the Rakshasa angry with<br>his sister, smiled (in derision), and said, addressing him, 'O Hidimva,<br>what need is there for thee to awaken these persons sleeping so<br>comfortably? O wicked cannibal, approach me first without loss of time.<br>Smite me first,&#8212;it behoveth thee not to kill a woman, especially when<br>she hath been sinned against instead of sinning. This girl is scarcely<br>responsible for her act in desiring intercourse with me. She hath, in<br>this, been moved by the deity of desire that pervadeth every living form.<br>Thou wicked wretch and the most infamous of Rakshasas, thy sister came<br>here at thy command. Beholding my person, she desireth me. In that the<br>timid girl doth no injury to thee. It is the deity of desire that hath<br>offended. It behoveth thee not to injure her for this offence. O wicked<br>wretch, thou shalt not slay a woman when I am here. Come with me, O<br>cannibal, and fight with myself singly. Singly shall I send thee today to<br>the abode of Yama (Pluto). O Rakshasa, let thy head today, pressed by my<br>might, be pounded to pieces, as though pressed by the tread of a mighty<br>elephant. When thou art slain by me on the field of battle, let herons<br>and hawks and jackals tear in glee thy limbs today on the ground. In a<br>moment I shall today make this forest destitute of Rakshasas,&#8212;this<br>forest that had so long been ruled by thee, devourer of human beings! Thy<br>sister, O Rakshasa, shall today behold thyself, huge though thou art like<br>a mountain, like a huge elephant repeatedly dragged by a lion, O worst of<br>Rakshasas, thyself slain by me, men ranging these woods will henceforth<br>do so safely and without fear.'<br><br>"Hearing these words, Hidimva said, 'What need is there, O man, for this<br>thy vaunt and this thy boast? Accomplish all this first, and then mayst<br>thou vaunt indeed. Therefore, delay thou not. Thou knowest thyself to be<br>strong and endued with prowess, so thou shalt rightly estimate thy<br>strength today in thy encounter with me. Until that, I will not slay<br>these (thy brothers). Let them sleep comfortably. But I will, as thou art<br>a fool and the utterer of evil speeches, slay thee first. After drinking<br>thy blood, I will slay these also, and then last of all, this (sister of<br>mine) that hath done me an injury.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Saying this, the cannibal, extending his arms<br>ran in wrath towards Bhimasena, that chastiser of foes. Then Bhima of<br>terrible prowess quickly seized, as though in sport, with great force,<br>the extended arms of the Rakshasa who had rushed at him. Then seizing the<br>struggling Rakshasa with violence, Bhima dragged him from that spot full<br>thirty-two cubits like a lion dragging a little animal. Then the<br>Rakshasa, thus made to feel the weight of Bhima's strength, became very<br>angry and clasping the Pandava, sent forth a terrible yell. The mighty<br>Bhima then dragged with force the Rakshasa to a greater distance, lest<br>his yells should awaken his brothers sleeping in comfort. Clasping and<br>dragging each other with great force, both Hidimva and Bhimasena put<br>forth their prowess. Fighting like two full-grown elephants mad with<br>rage, they then began to break down the trees and tear the creepers that<br>grew around. And at those sounds, those tigers among men (the sleeping<br>Pandavas) woke up with their mother, and saw Hidimva sitting before<br>them.'"
