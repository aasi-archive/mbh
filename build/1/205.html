                            (Viduragamana Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Asked by Dhritarashtra to give his opinion, Bhishma<br>replied, 'O Dhritarashtra, a quarrel with the Pandavas is what I can<br>never approve of. As thou art to me, so was Pandu without doubt. And the<br>sons of Gandhari are to me, as those of Kunti. I should protect them as<br>well as I should thy sons, O Dhritarashtra! And, O king, the Pandavas are<br>as much near to me as they are to prince Duryodhana or to all the other<br>Kurus. Under these circumstances a quarrel with them is what I never<br>like. Concluding a treaty with those heroes, let half the land be given<br>unto them. This is without doubt, the paternal kingdom of those foremost<br>ones of the Kuru race. And, O Duryodhana, like thee who lookest upon this<br>kingdom as thy paternal property, the Pandavas also look upon it as their<br>paternal possession. If the renowned sons of Pandu obtain not the<br>kingdom, how can it be thine, or that of any other descendant of the<br>Bharata race? If thou regardest thyself as one that hath lawfully come<br>into the possession of the kingdom, I think they also may be regarded to<br>have lawfully come into the possession of this kingdom before thee. Give<br>them half the kingdom quietly. This, O tiger among men, is beneficial to<br>all. If thou actest otherwise, evil will befall us all. Thou too shall be<br>covered with dishonour. O Duryodhana, strive to maintain thy good name. A<br>good name is, indeed, the source of one's strength. It hath been said<br>that one liveth in vain whose reputation hath gone. A man, O Kaurava,<br>doth not die so long as his fame lasteth. One liveth as long as one's<br>fame endureth, and dieth when one's fame is gone. Follow thou, O son of<br>Gandhari, the practice that is worthy of the Kuru race. O thou of mighty<br>arms, imitate thy own ancestors. We are fortunate that the Pandavas have<br>not perished. We are fortunate that Kunti liveth. We are fortunate that<br>the wretch Purochana without being able to accomplish his purpose hath<br>himself perished. From that time when I heard that the sons of<br>Kuntibhoja's daughter had been burnt to death, I was, O son of Gandhari,<br>ill able to meet any living creature. O tiger among men, hearing of the<br>fate that overtook Kunti, the world doth not regard Purochana so guilty<br>as it regardeth thee. O king, the escape, therefore, of the sons of Pandu<br>with life from that conflagration and their re-appearance, do away with<br>thy evil repute. Know, O thou of Kuru's race, that as long as those<br>heroes live, the wielder of the thunder himself cannot deprive them of<br>their ancestral share in the kingdom. The Pandavas are virtuous and<br>united. They are being wrongly kept out of their equal share in the<br>kingdom. If thou shouldst act rightly, if thou shouldst do what is<br>agreeable to me, if thou shouldst seek the welfare of all, then give half<br>the kingdom unto them.'"
