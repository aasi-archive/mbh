                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'O Brahmana, it behoveth thee to relate to me<br>everything about the birth of Kripa. How did he spring from a clump of<br>heath? Whence also did he obtain his weapons?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'O king, the great sage Gautama had a son named<br>Saradwat. This Saradwat was born with arrows (in hand). O oppressor of<br>foes, the son of Gautama exhibited great aptitude for the study of the<br>science of weapons, but none for the other sciences. Saradwat acquired<br>all his weapons by those austerities by which Brahmanas in student life<br>acquire the knowledge of Vedas. Gautama (the son of Gotama) by his<br>aptitude for the science of weapons and by his austerities made Indra<br>himself greatly afraid of him. Then, O thou of Kuru's race, the chief of<br>the gods summoned a celestial damsel named Janapadi and sent her unto<br>Gautama, saying, 'Do thy best to disturb the austerities of Gautama.'<br>Repairing unto the charming asylum of Saradwat, the damsel began to tempt<br>the ascetic equipped with bow and arrows. Beholding that Apsara, of<br>figure unrivalled on earth for beauty, alone in those woods and clad in a<br>single piece of cloth, Saradwat's eyes expanded with delight. At the<br>sight of the damsel, his bow and arrows slipped from his hand and his<br>frame shook all over with emotion; but possessed of ascetic fortitude and<br>strength of soul, the sage mustered sufficient patience to bear up<br>against the temptation. The suddenness, however, of his mental agitation,<br>caused an unconscious emission of his vital fluid. Leaving his bow and<br>arrows and deer-skin behind, he went away, flying from the Apsara. His<br>vital fluid, however, having fallen upon a clump of heath, was divided<br>into two parts, whence sprang two children that were twins.<br><br>"And it happened that a soldier in attendance upon king Santanu while the<br>monarch was out a-hunting in the woods, came upon the twins. And seeing<br>the bow and arrows and deer-skin on the ground, he thought they might be<br>the offspring of some Brahmana proficient in the science of arms.<br>Deciding thus, he took up the children along with the bow and arrows, and<br>showed what he had to the king. Beholding them the king was moved with<br>pity, and saying, 'Let these become my children,' brought them to his<br>palace. Then that first of men, Santanu, the son of Pratipa having<br>brought Gautama's twins into his house, performed in respect of them the<br>usual rites of religion. And he began to bring them up and called them<br>Kripa and Kripi, in allusion to the fact that he brought them up from<br>motives of pity (Kripa). The son of Gotama having left his former asylum,<br>continued his study of the science of arms in right earnest. By his<br>spiritual insight he learnt that his son and daughter were in the palace<br>of Santanu. He thereupon went to the monarch and represented everything<br>about his lineage. He then taught Kripa the four branches of the science<br>of arms, and various other branches of knowledge, including all their<br>mysteries and recondite details. In a short time Kripa became an eminent<br>professor of the science (of arms). And the hundred sons of<br>Dhritarashtra, and the Pandavas along with the Yadavas, and the Vrishnis,<br>and many other princes from various lands, began to receive lessons from<br>him in that science.'"
