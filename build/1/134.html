                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus worshipped by Bhishma, Drona, that first of<br>men, endued with great energy, took up his quarters in the abode of the<br>Kurus and continued to live there, receiving their adorations. After he<br>had rested a while, Bhishma, taking with him his grandsons, the Kaurava<br>princes, gave them unto him as pupils, making at the same time many<br>valuable presents. And the mighty one (Bhishma) also joyfully gave unto<br>the son of Bharadwaja a house that was tidy and neat and well-filled with<br>paddy and every kind of wealth. And that first of archers, Drona,<br>thereupon joyfully, accepted the Kauravas, viz., the sons of Pandu and<br>Dhritarashtra, as his pupils. And having accepted them all as his pupils,<br>one day Drona called them apart and making them touch his feet, said to<br>them with a swelling heart, 'I have in my heart a particular purpose.<br>Promise me truly, ye sinless ones, that when ye have become skilled in<br>arms, ye will accomplish it.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words, the Kuru princes remained<br>silent. But Arjuna, O king, vowed to accomplish it whatever it was. Drona<br>then cheerfully clasped Arjuna to his bosom and took the scent of his<br>head repeatedly, shedding tears of joy all the while. Then Drona endued<br>with great prowess taught the sons of Pandu (the use of) many weapons<br>both celestial and human. And, O bull of the Bharata race, many other<br>princes also flocked to that best of Brahmanas for instruction in arms.<br>The Vrishnis and the Andhakas, and princes from various lands, and the<br>(adopted) son of Radha of the Suta caste, (Karna), all became pupils of<br>Drona. But of them all, the Suta child Karna, from jealousy, frequently<br>defied Arjuna, and supported by Duryodhana, used to disregard the<br>Pandavas. Arjuna, however, from devotion to the science of arms, always<br>stayed by the side of his preceptor, and in skill, strength of arms, and<br>perseverance, excelled all (his class-fellows). Indeed, although the<br>instruction the preceptor gave, was the same in the case of all, yet in<br>lightness and skill Arjuna became the foremost of all his fellow-pupils.<br>And Drona was convinced that none of his pupils would (at any time) be<br>able to be equal to that son of Indra.<br><br>"Thus Drona continued giving lessons to the princes in the science of<br>weapons. And while he gave unto every one of his pupils a narrow-mouthed<br>vessel (for fetching water) in order that much time may be spent in<br>filling them, he gave unto his own son Aswatthaman a broad-mouthed<br>vessel, so that, filling it quickly, he might return soon enough. And in<br>the intervals so gained, Drona used to instruct his own son in several<br>superior methods (of using weapons). Jishnu (Arjuna) came to know of<br>this, and thereupon filling his narrow-mouthed vessel with water by means<br>of the Varuna weapon he used to come unto his preceptor at the same time<br>with his preceptor's son. And accordingly the intelligent son of Pritha,<br>that foremost of all men possessing a knowledge of weapons, had no<br>inferiority to his preceptor's son in respect of excellence. Arjuna's<br>devotion to the service of his preceptor as also to arms was very great<br>and he soon became the favourite of his preceptor. And Drona, beholding<br>his pupil's devotion to arms, summoned the cook, and told him in secret,<br>'Never give Arjuna his food in the dark, nor tell him that I have told<br>thee this.' A few days after, however, when Arjuna was taking his food, a<br>wind arose, and thereupon the lamp that had been burning went out. But<br>Arjuna, endued with energy, continued eating in the dark, his hand, from<br>habit, going to his mouth. His attention being thus called to the force<br>of habit, the strong-armed son of Pandu set his heart upon practising<br>with his bow in the night. And, O Bharata, Drona, hearing the twang of<br>his bowstring in the night, came to him, and clasping him, said, 'Truly<br>do I tell thee that I shall do that unto thee by which there shall not be<br>an archer equal to thee in this world.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thereafter Drona began to teach Arjuna the art<br>of fighting on horse-back, on the back of elephants, on car, and on the<br>ground. And the mighty Drona also instructed Arjuna in fighting with the<br>mace, the sword, the lance, the spear, and the dart. And he also<br>instructed him in using many weapons and fighting with many men at the<br>same time. And hearing reports of his skill, kings and princes, desirous<br>of learning the science of arms, flocked to Drona by thousands. Amongst<br>those that came there, O monarch, was a prince named Ekalavya, who was<br>the son of Hiranyadhanus, king of the Nishadas (the lowest of the mixed<br>orders). Drona, however, cognisant of all rules of morality, accepted not<br>the prince as his pupil in archery, seeing that he was a Nishada who<br>might (in time) excel all his high-born pupils. But, O oppressor of all<br>enemies, the Nishada prince, touching Drona's feet with bent head, wended<br>his way into the forest, and there he made a clay-image of Drona, and<br>began to worship it respectfully, as if it was his real preceptor, and<br>practised weapons before it with the most rigid regularity. In<br>consequence of his exceptional reverence for his preceptor and his<br>devotion to his purpose, all the three processes of fixing arrows on the<br>bowstring, aiming, and letting off became very easy for him.<br><br>"And one day, O grinder of foes, the Kuru and the Pandava princes, with<br>Drona's leave, set out in their cars on a hunting excursion. A servant, O<br>king, followed the party at leisure, with the usual implements and a dog.<br>Having come to the woods, they wandered about, intent on the purpose they<br>had in view. Meanwhile, the dog also, in wandering alone in the woods,<br>came upon the Nishada prince (Ekalavya). And beholding the Nishada of<br>dark hue, of body besmeared with filth, dressed in black and bearing<br>matted locks on head, the dog began to bark aloud.<br><br>"Thereupon the Nishada prince, desirous of exhibiting his lightness of<br>hand, sent seven arrows into its mouth (before it could shut it). The<br>dog, thus pierced with seven arrows, came back to the Pandavas. Those<br>heroes, who beheld that sight, were filled with wonder, and, ashamed of<br>their own skill, began to praise the lightness of hand and precision of<br>aim by auricular precision (exhibited by the unknown archer). And they<br>thereupon began to seek in those woods for the unknown dweller therein<br>that had shown such skill. And, O king, the Pandavas soon found out the<br>object of their search ceaselessly discharging arrows from the bow. And<br>beholding that man of grim visage, who was totally a stranger to them,<br>they asked, 'Who art thou and whose son?' Thus questioned, the man<br>replied, 'Ye heroes, I am the son of Hiranyadhanus, king of the Nishadas.<br>Know me also for a pupil of Drona, labouring for the mastery of the art<br>of arms.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The Pandavas then, having made themselves<br>acquainted with everything connected with him, returned (to the city),<br>and going unto Drona, told him of that wonderful feat of archery which<br>they had witnessed in the woods. Arjuna, in particular, thinking all the<br>while, O king, Ekalavya, saw Drona in private and relying upon his<br>preceptor's affection for him, said, 'Thou hadst lovingly told me,<br>clasping me, to thy bosom, that no pupil of thine should be equal to me.<br>Why then is there a pupil of thine, the mighty son of the Nishada king,<br>superior to me?"<br><br>'Vaisampayana continued, 'On hearing these words, Drona reflected for a<br>moment, and resolving upon the course of action he should follow, took<br>Arjuna with him and went unto the Nishada prince. And he beheld Ekalavya<br>with body besmeared with filth, matted locks (on head), clad in rags,<br>bearing a bow in hand and ceaselessly shooting arrows therefrom. And when<br>Ekalavya saw Drona approaching towards him, he went a few steps forward,<br>and touched his feet and prostrated himself on the ground. And the son of<br>the Nishada king worshipping Drona, duly represented himself as his<br>pupil, and clasping his hands in reverence stood before him (awaiting his<br>commands). Then Drona, O king, addressed Ekalavya, saying, 'If, O hero,<br>thou art really my pupil, give me then my fees.' On hearing these words,<br>Ekalavya was very much gratified, and said in reply, 'O illustrious<br>preceptor, what shall I give? Command me; for there is nothing, O<br>foremost of all persons conversant with the Vedas, that I may not give<br>unto my preceptor.' Drona answered, 'O Ekalavya, if thou art really<br>intent on making me a gift, I should like then to have the thumb of thy<br>right hand.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these cruel words of Drona, who had<br>asked of him his thumb as tuition-fee, Ekalavya, ever devoted to truth<br>and desirous also of keeping his promise, with a cheerful face and an<br>unafflicted heart cut off without ado his thumb, and gave it unto Drona.<br>After this, when the Nishada prince began once more to shoot with the<br>help of his remaining fingers, he found, O king, that he had lost his<br>former lightness of hand. And at this Arjuna became happy, the fever (of<br>jealousy) having left him.<br><br>"Two of Drona's pupils became very much accomplished in the use of mace.<br>These were Druvodhana and Bhima, who were, however, always jealous of<br>each other. Aswatthaman excelled everyone (in the mysteries of the<br>science of arms). The twins (Nakula and Sahadeva) excelled everybody in<br>handling the sword. Yudhishthira surpassed everybody as a car-warrior;<br>but Arjuna, however, outdistanced everyone in every respect&#8212;in<br>intelligence, resourcefulness, strength and perseverance. Accomplished in<br>all weapons, Arjuna became the foremost of even the foremost of<br>car-warriors; and his fame spread all over the earth to the verge of the<br>sea. And although the instruction was the same, the mighty Arjuna<br>excelled all (the princes in lightness of hand). Indeed, in weapons as in<br>devotion to his preceptor, he became the foremost of them all. And<br>amongst all the princes, Arjuna alone became an Atiratha (a car-warrior<br>capable of fighting at one time with sixty thousand foes). And the wicked<br>sons of Dhritarashtra, beholding Bhimasena endued with great strength and<br>Arjuna accomplished in all arms, became very jealous of them.<br><br>"O bull among men, one day Drona desirous of testing the comparative<br>excellence of all his pupils in the use of arms, collected them all<br>together after their education had been completed. And before assembling<br>them together, he had caused an artificial bird, as the would be aim, to<br>be placed on the top of a neighbouring tree. And when they were all<br>together, Drona said unto them, 'Take up your bows quickly and stand here<br>aiming at that bird on the tree, with arrows fixed on your bowstrings;<br>shoot and cut off the bird's head, as soon as I give the order. I shall<br>give each of you a turn, one by one, my children.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Drona, that foremost of all Angira's sons<br>first addressed Yudhishthira saying, 'O irrepressible one, aim with thy<br>arrow and shoot as soon as I give the order. Yudhishthira took up the bow<br>first, as desired, O king, by his preceptor, and stood aiming at the<br>bird. But, O bull of Bharata's race, Drona in an instant, addressing the<br>Kuru prince standing with bow in hand, said, 'Behold, O prince, that bird<br>on top of the tree.' Yudhishthira replied unto his preceptor, saying, 'I<br>do.' But the next instant Drona again asked him, 'What dost thou see now,<br>O prince? Seest thou the tree, myself or thy brothers?' Yudhishthira<br>answered, 'I see the tree, myself, my brothers, and the bird.' Drona<br>repeated his question, but was answered as often in the same words. Drona<br>then, vexed with Yudhishthira, reproachingly said, 'Stand thou apart. It<br>is not for thee to strike the aim.' Then Drona repeated the experiment<br>with Duryodhana and the other sons of Dhritarashtra, one after another,<br>as also with his other pupils, Bhima and the rest, including the princes<br>that had come unto him from other lands. But the answer in every case was<br>the same as Yudhishthira's viz., 'We behold the tree, thyself, our<br>fellow-pupils, and the bird.' And reproached by their preceptor, they<br>were all ordered, one after another, to stand apart.'"
