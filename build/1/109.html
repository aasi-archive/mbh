                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Upon the birth of those three children, Kurujangala,<br>Kurukshetra, and the Kurus grew in prosperity. The earth began to yield<br>abundant harvest, and the crops also were of good flavour. And the clouds<br>began to pour rain in season and trees became full of fruits and flowers.<br>And the draught cattle were all happy and the birds and other animals<br>rejoiced exceedingly. And the flowers became fragrant and the fruits<br>became sweet; the cities and towns became filled with merchants,<br>artisans, traders and artists of every description. And the people became<br>brave, learned, honest and happy. And there were no robbers then, nor<br>anybody who was sinful. And it seemed that the golden age had come upon<br>every part of the kingdom. And the people devoted to virtuous acts,<br>sacrifices and truth, and regarding one another with love and affection<br>grew in prosperity. And free from pride, wrath and covetousness, they<br>rejoiced in perfectly innocent sports. And the capital of the Kurus, full<br>as the ocean, was a second Amaravati, teeming with hundreds of palaces<br>and mansions, and possessing gates and arches dark as the clouds. And men<br>in great cheerfulness sported constantly on rivers, lakes and tanks, and<br>in fine groves and charming woods. And the southern Kurus, in their<br>virtuous rivalry with their northern kinsmen, walked about in the company<br>of Siddhas and Charanas and Rishis. And all over that delightful country<br>whose prosperity was thus increased by the Kurus, there were no misers<br>and no widowed women. And the wells and lakes were ever full; the groves<br>abounded with trees, and the houses and abodes of Brahmanas were full of<br>wealth and the whole kingdom was full of festivities. And, O king,<br>virtuously ruled by Bhishma, the kingdom was adorned with hundreds of<br>sacrificial stakes. And the wheel of virtue having been set in motion by<br>Bhishma, and the country became so contented that the subjects of other<br>kingdoms, quitting their homes, came to dwell there and increase its<br>population. And the citizens and the people were filled with hope, upon<br>seeing the youthful acts of their illustrious princes. And, O king, in<br>the house of the Kuru chiefs as also of the principal citizens, 'give',<br>'eat' were the only words constantly heard. And Dhritarashtra and Pandu<br>and Vidura of great intelligence were from their birth brought up by<br>Bhishma, as if they were his own sons. And the children, having passed<br>through the usual rites of their order, devoted themselves to vows and<br>study. And they grew up into fine young men skilled in the Vedas and all<br>athletic sports. And they became well-skilled in the practice of bow, in<br>horsemanship, in encounters with mace, sword and shield, in the<br>management of elephants in battle, and in the science of morality.<br>Well-read in history and the Puranas and various branches of learning,<br>and acquainted with the truths of the Vedas and their branches they<br>acquired knowledge, which was versatile and deep. And Pandu, possessed of<br>great prowess, excelled all men in archery while Dhritarashtra excelled<br>all in personal strength, while in the three worlds there was no one<br>equal to Vidura in devotion to virtue and in the knowledge of the<br>dictates of morality. And beholding the restoration of the extinct line<br>of Santanu, the saying became current in all countries that among mothers<br>of heroes, the daughters of the king of Kasi were the first; that among<br>countries Kurujangala was the first; that among virtuous men, Vidura was<br>the first; that among cities Hastinapura was the first. Pandu became<br>king, for Dhritarashtra, owing to the blindness, and Vidura, for his<br>birth by a Sudra woman, did not obtain the kingdom. One day Bhishma, the<br>foremost of those acquainted with the duties of a statesman and dictates<br>of morality, properly addressing Vidura conversant with the truth of<br>religion and virtue, said as follows."
