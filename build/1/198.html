                            (Vaivahika Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then all the Pandavas and the illustrious king of<br>the Panchalas and all others there present stood up and saluted with<br>reverence the illustrious Rishi Krishna (Dwaipayana). The high-souled<br>Rishi, saluting them in return and enquiring after their welfare, sat<br>down on a carpet of gold. And commanded by Krishna (Dwaipayana) of<br>immeasurable energy, those foremost of men all sat down on costly seats.<br>A little after, O monarch, the son of Prishata in sweet accents asked the<br>illustrious Rishi about the wedding of his daughter. And he said, 'How, O<br>illustrious one, can one woman become the wife of many men without being<br>defiled by sin? O, tell me truly all about this.' Hearing these words<br>Vyasa replied, 'This practice, O king, being opposed to usage and the<br>Vedas, hath become obsolete. I desire, however, to hear what the opinion<br>of each of you is upon this matter.'<br><br>"Hearing these words of the Rishi, Drupada spoke first, saying, 'The<br>practice is sinful in my opinion, being opposed to both usage and the<br>Vedas. O best of Brahmanas, nowhere have I seen many men having one wife.<br>The illustrious ones also of former ages never had such a usage amongst<br>them. The wise should never commit a sin. I, therefore, can never make up<br>mind to act in this way. This practice always appeareth to me to be of<br>doubtful morality.<br><br>"After Drupada had ceased, Dhrishtadyumna spoke, saying 'O bull amongst<br>Brahmanas, O thou of ascetic wealth, how can, O Brahmana, the elder<br>brother, if he is of a good disposition, approach the wife of his younger<br>brother? The ways of morality are ever subtle, and, therefore, we know<br>them not. We cannot, therefore, say what is conformable to morality and<br>what not. We cannot do such a deed, therefore, with a safe conscience.<br>Indeed, O Brahmana, I cannot say, 'Let Draupadi become the common wife of<br>five brothers.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira then spoke, saying, 'My tongue never uttereth an untruth<br>and my heart never inclineth to what is sinful. When my heart approveth<br>of it, it can never be sinful. I have heard in the Purana that a lady of<br>name Jatila, the foremost of all virtuous women belonging to the race of<br>Gotama had married seven Rishis. So also an ascetic's daughter, born of a<br>tree, had in former times united herself in marriage with ten brothers<br>all bearing the same name of Prachetas and who were all of souls exalted<br>by asceticism. O foremost of all that are acquainted with the rules of<br>morality, it is said that obedience to superior is ever meritorious.<br>Amongst all superiors, it is well-known that the mother is the foremost.<br>Even she hath commanded us to enjoy Draupadi as we do anything obtained<br>as alms. It is for this, O best of Brahmanas, that I regard the<br>(proposed) act as virtuous.'<br><br>"Kunti then said, 'The act is even so as the virtuous Yudhishthira hath<br>said. I greatly fear, O Brahmana, lest my speech should become untrue.<br>How shall I be saved from untruth?'<br><br>"When they had all finished speaking, Vyasa said, 'O amiable one, how<br>shall thou be saved from the consequence of untruth? Even this is eternal<br>virtue! I will not, O king of the Panchalas, discourse on this before you<br>all. But thou alone shalt listen to me when I disclose how this practice<br>hath been established and why it is to be regarded as old and eternal.<br>There is no doubt that what Yudhishthira hath said is quite conformable<br>to virtue.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then the illustrious Vyasa&#8212;the master<br>Dwaipayana&#8212;rose, and taking hold of Drupada's hand led him to a private<br>apartment. The Pandavas and Kunti and Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race<br>sat there, waiting for the return of Vyasa and Drupada. Meanwhile,<br>Dwaipayana began his discourse with illustrious monarch for explaining<br>how the practice of polyandry could not be regarded as sinful.'"
