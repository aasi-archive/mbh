                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'What did the god of justice do for which he was<br>cursed? And who was the Brahmana ascetic from whose curse the god had to<br>be born in the Sudra caste?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'There was a Brahmana known by the name of Mandavya.<br>He was conversant with all duties and was devoted to religion, truth and<br>asceticism. The great ascetic used to sit at the entrance of his<br>hermitage at the foot of a tree, with his arms upraised in the observance<br>of the vow of silence. And as he sat there for years together, one day<br>there came into his asylum a number of robbers laden with spoil. And, O<br>bull in Bharata's race, those robbers were then being pursued by a<br>superior body as guardians of the peace. The thieves, on entering that<br>asylum, hid their booty there, and in fear concealed themselves<br>thereabout before the guards came. But scarcely had they thus concealed<br>themselves when the constables in pursuit came to the spot. The latter,<br>observing the Rishi sitting under the tree, questioned him, O king,<br>saying, 'O best of Brahmanas, which way have the thieves taken? Point it<br>out to us so that we may follow it without loss of time.' Thus questioned<br>by the guardians of peace the ascetic, O king, said not a word, good or<br>otherwise, in reply. The officers of the king, however, on searching that<br>asylum soon discovered the thieves concealed thereabout together with the<br>plunder. Upon this, their suspicion fell upon the Muni, and accordingly<br>they seized him with the thieves and brought him before the king. The<br>king sentenced him to be executed along with his supposed associates. And<br>the officers, acting in ignorance, carried out the sentence by impaling<br>the celebrated Rishi. And having impaled him, they went to the king with<br>the booty they had recovered. But the virtuous Rishi, though impaled and<br>kept without food, remained in that state for a long time without dying.<br>And the Rishi by his ascetic power not only preserved his life but<br>summoned other Rishi to the scene. And they came there in the night in<br>the forms of birds, and beholding him engaged in ascetic meditation<br>though fixed on that stake, became plunged into grief. And telling that<br>best of Brahmanas who they were, they asked him saying, 'O Brahmana, we<br>desire to know what hath been thy sin for which thou hast thus been made<br>to suffer the tortures of impalement!'"
