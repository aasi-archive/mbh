                            (Chaitraratha Parva continued)<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'Then, O Partha, Adrisyanti, who had been<br>residing in Vasishtha's asylum, brought forth (when the time came) a son<br>who was the perpetuator of Saktri's race and who was a second Saktri in<br>everything. O foremost of Bharatas, that best of Munis, the illustrious<br>Vasishtha himself performed the usual after-birth ceremonies of his<br>grandson. And, because the Rishi Vasishtha had resolved on<br>self-destruction but had abstained therefrom as soon as he knew of the<br>existence of that child, that child, when born, was called Parasara (the<br>vivifier of the dead). The virtuous Parasara, from the day of his birth,<br>knew Vasishtha for his father and behaved towards the Muni as such. One<br>day, O son of Kunti, the child addressed Vasishtha, that first of<br>Brahmana sages, as father, in the presence of his mother Adrisyanti.<br>Adrisyanti, hearing the very intelligible sound father sweetly uttered by<br>her son, addressed him with tearful eyes and said, 'O child, do not<br>address this thy grandfather as father? Thy father, O son, has been<br>devoured by a Rakshasa in a different forest. O innocent one, he is not<br>thy father whom thou regardest so. The revered one is the father of that<br>celebrated father of thine.' Thus addressed by his mother that best of<br>Rishis of truthful speech, gave way to sorrow, but soon fired up and<br>resolved to destroy the whole creation. Then that illustrious and great<br>ascetic Vasishtha, that foremost of all persons conversant with Brahma,<br>that son of Mitravaruna, that Rishi acquainted with positive truth,<br>addressed his grandson who had set his heart upon the destruction of the<br>world. Hear, O Arjuna, the arguments by which Vasishtha succeeded in<br>driving out that resolution from his grandson's mind.'<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'Then Vasishtha said, 'There was a celebrated<br>king of the name of Kritavirya. That bull among the kings of the earth<br>was the disciple of the Veda-knowing Bhrigus. That king, O child, after<br>performing the Soma sacrifice, gratified the Brahmanas with great<br>presents of rice and wealth. After that monarch had ascended to heaven,<br>an occasion came when his descendants were in want of wealth. And knowing<br>that the Bhrigus were rich, those princes went unto those best of<br>Brahmanas, in the guise of beggars. Some amongst the Bhrigus, to protect<br>their wealth, buried it under earth; and some from fear of the<br>Kshatriyas, began to give away their wealth unto (other) Brahmanas; while<br>some amongst them duly gave unto the Kshatriyas whatever they wanted. It<br>happened, however, that some Kshatriyas, in digging as they pleased at<br>the house of particular Bhargava, came upon a large treasure. And the<br>treasure was seen by all those bulls among Kshatriyas who had been there.<br>Enraged at what they regarded as the deceitful behaviour of the Bhrigus,<br>the Kshatriyas insulted the Brahmanas, though the latter asked for mercy.<br>And those mighty bowmen began to slaughter the Bhrigus with their sharp<br>arrows. And the Kshatriyas wandered over the earth, slaughtering even the<br>embryos that were in the wombs of the women of the Bhrigu race. And while<br>the Bhrigu race was thus being exterminated, the women of that tribe fled<br>from fear to the inaccessible mountains of Himavat. And one amongst these<br>women, of tapering thighs, desiring to perpetuate her husband's race,<br>held in one of her thighs an embryo endued with great energy. A certain<br>Brahmana woman, however, who came to know this fact, went from fear unto<br>the Kshatriyas and reported the matter unto them. And the Kshatriyas then<br>went to destroy that embryo. Arrived at the place, they beheld the<br>would-be mother blazing with inborn energy, and the child that was in her<br>thigh came out tearing up the thigh and dazzling the eyes of those<br>Kshatriyas like the midday sun. Thus deprived of their eyes, the<br>Kshatriyas began to wander over those inaccessible mountains. And<br>distressed at the loss of sight, the princes were afflicted with woe, and<br>desirous of regaining the use of their eyes they resolved to seek the<br>protection of that faultless woman. Then those Kshatriyas, afflicted with<br>sorrow, and from loss of sight like unto a fire that hath gone out,<br>addressed with anxious hearts that illustrious lady, saying, 'By thy<br>grace. O lady, we wish to be restored to sight. We shall then return to<br>our homes all together and abstain for ever from our sinful practice. O<br>handsome one, it behoveth thee with thy child to show us mercy. It<br>behoveth thee to favour these kings by granting them their eye-sight.'"
