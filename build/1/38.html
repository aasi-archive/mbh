                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Hearing the respective speeches of all the snakes, and<br>hearing also the words of Vasuki, Elapatra began to address them, saying,<br>'That sacrifice is not one that can be prevented. Nor is king Janamejaya<br>of the Pandava race from whom this fear proceedeth, such that he can be<br>hindered. The person, O king, who is afflicted by fate hath recourse to<br>fate alone; nothing else can be his refuge. Ye best of snakes, this fear<br>of ours hath fate for its root. Fate alone must be our refuge in this.<br>Listen to what I say. When that curse was uttered, ye best of snakes, in<br>fear I lay crouching on the lap of our mother. Ye best of snakes, and O<br>lord (Vasuki) of great splendour, from that place I heard the words the<br>sorrowing gods spake unto the Grandsire. The gods said, 'O Grandsire,<br>thou god of gods who else than the cruel Kadru could thus, after getting<br>such dear children, curse them so, even in thy presence? And, O<br>Grandsire, by thee also hath been spoken, with reference to those words<br>of hers, 'Be it so.' We wish to know the reason why thou didst not<br>prevent her.' Brahman replied, 'The snakes have multiplied. They are<br>cruel, terrible in form and highly poisonous. From desire of the good of<br>my creatures, I did not prevent Kadru then. Those poisonous serpents and<br>others who are sinful, biting others for no faults, shall, indeed, be<br>destroyed, but not they who are harmless and virtuous. And hear also,<br>how, when the hour comes, the snakes may escape this dreadful calamity.<br>There shall be born in the race of the Yayavaras a great Rishi known by<br>the name of Jaratkaru, intelligent, with passions under complete control.<br>That Jaratkaru shall have a son of the name of Astika. He shall put a<br>stop to that sacrifice. And those snakes who shall be virtuous shall<br>escape therefrom. The gods said, 'O thou truth-knowing one, on whom will<br>Jaratkaru, that foremost Muni, gifted with great energy and asceticism,<br>beget that illustrious son?' Brahma answered, 'Gifted with great energy,<br>that best Brahmana shall beget a son possessed of great energy on a wife<br>of the same name as his. Vasuki, the king of the snakes, hath a sister of<br>the name of Jaratkaru; the son, of whom I speak, shall be born of her,<br>and he shall liberate the snakes.'<br><br>"Elapatra continued, 'The gods then said unto the Grandsire, 'Be it so.'<br>And the lord Brahman, having said so unto the gods, went to heaven. O<br>Vasuki, I see before me that sister of thine known by the name of<br>Jaratkaru. For relieving us from fear, give her as alms unto him (i.e.,<br>the Rishi), Jaratkaru, of excellent vows, who shall roam abegging for a<br>bride. This means of release hath been heard of by me!'"
