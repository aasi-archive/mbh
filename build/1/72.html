                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>Kanwa continued, 'And Sakra, thus addressed by her, then commanded him<br>who could approach every place (viz., the god of the wind) to be present<br>with Menaka at the time she would be before the Rishi. And the timid and<br>beautiful Menaka then entered the retreat and saw there Viswamitra who<br>had burnt, by his penances, all his sins, and was engaged still in<br>ascetic penances. And saluting the Rishi, she then began to sport before<br>him. And just at that time Marut robbed her of her garments that were<br>white as the Moon. And she thereupon ran, as if in great bashfulness, to<br>catch hold of her attire, and as if she was exceedingly annoyed with<br>Marut. And she did all this before the very eyes of Viswamitra who was<br>endued with energy like that of fire. And Viswamitra saw her in that<br>attitude. And beholding her divested of her robes, he saw that she was of<br>faultless feature. And that best of Munis saw that she was exceedingly<br>handsome, with no marks of age on her person. And beholding her beauty<br>and accomplishments that bull amongst Rishis was possessed with lust and<br>made a sign that he desired her companionship. And he invited her<br>accordingly, and she also of faultless features expressed her acceptance<br>of the invitation. And they then passed a long time there in each other's<br>company. And sporting with each other, just as they pleased, for a long<br>time as if it were only a single day, the Rishi begat on Menaka a<br>daughter named Sakuntala. And Menaka (as her conception advanced) went to<br>the banks of the river Malini coursing along a valley of the charming<br>mountains of Himavat. And there she gave birth to that daughter. And she<br>left the new-born infant on the bank of that river and went away. And<br>beholding the new-born infant lying in that forest destitute of human<br>beings but abounding with lions and tigers, a number of vultures sat<br>around to protect it from harm. No Rakshasas or carnivorous animals took<br>its life. Those vultures protected the daughter of Menaka. I went there<br>to perform my ablution and beheld the infant lying in the solitude of the<br>wilderness surrounded by vultures. Bringing her hither I have made her my<br>daughter. Indeed, the maker of the body, the protector of life, the giver<br>of food, are all three, fathers in their order, according to the<br>scriptures. And because she was surrounded in the solitude of the<br>wilderness, by Sakuntas (birds), therefore, hath she been named by me<br>Sakuntala (bird-protected). O Brahman, learn that it is thus that<br>Sakuntala hath become my daughter. And the faultless Sakuntala also<br>regards me as her father.'<br><br>"This is what my father had said unto the Rishi, having been asked by<br>him. O king of men, it is thus that thou must know I am the daughter of<br>Kanwa. And not knowing my real father, I regard Kanwa as my father. Thus<br>have I told thee, O king, all that hath been heard by me regarding my<br>birth!'"
