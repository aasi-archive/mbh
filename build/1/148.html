                            (Jatugriha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then all the citizens (of Varanavata) on hearing<br>that the son of Pandu had come, were filled with joy at the tidings,<br>speedily came out of Varanavata, in vehicles of various kinds numbering<br>by thousands, taking with them every auspicious article as directed by<br>the Sastras, for receiving those foremost of men. And the people of<br>Varanavata, approaching the sons of Kunti blessed them by uttering the<br>Jaya and stood surrounding them. That tiger among men, viz., the virtuous<br>Yudhishthira thus surrounded by them looked resplendent like him having<br>the thunderbolt in his hands (viz., Indra) in the midst of the<br>celestials. And those sinless ones, welcomed by the citizens and<br>welcoming the citizens in return, then entered the populous town of<br>Varanavata decked with every ornament. Entering the town those heroes<br>first went, O monarch, to the abodes of Brahmanas engaged in their proper<br>duties. Those foremost of men then went to the abodes of the officials of<br>the town, and then of the Sutas and the Vaisyas and then to those of even<br>the Sudras, O bull of Bharata's race, thus adored by the citizens, the<br>Pandavas at last went with Purochana going before them, to the palace<br>that had been built for them, Purochana then began to place before them<br>food and drink and beds and carpets, all of the first and most agreeable<br>order. The Pandavas attired in costly robes, continued to live there,<br>adored by Purochana and the people having their homes in Varanavata.<br><br>"After the Pandavas had thus lived for ten nights, Purochana spoke to<br>them of the mansion (he had built) called 'The Blessed Home,' but in<br>reality the cursed house. Then those tigers among men, attired in costly<br>dress, entered that mansion at the instance of Purochana like Guhyakas<br>entering the palace (of Siva) on the Kailasa mount. The foremost of all<br>virtuous men, Yudhishthira, inspecting the house, said unto Bhima that it<br>was really built of inflammable materials. Smelling the scent of fat<br>mixed with clarified butter and preparations of lac, he said unto Bhima,<br>'O chastiser of foes, this house is truly built of inflammable materials!<br>Indeed, it is apparent that such is the case! The enemy, it is evident,<br>by the aid of trusted artists well-skilled in the construction of houses,<br>have finely built this mansion, after procuring hemp, resin, heath,<br>straw, and bamboos, all soaked in clarified butter. This wicked wretch,<br>Purochana, acting under the instruction of Duryodhana, stayeth here with<br>the object of burning me to death when he seeth me trustful. But, O son<br>of Pritha, Vidura of great intelligence, knew of this danger, and,<br>therefore, hath warned me of it beforehand. Knowing it all, that youngest<br>uncle of ours, ever wishing our good from affection hath told us that<br>this house, so full of danger, hath been constructed by the wretches<br>under Duryodhana acting in secrecy.'<br><br>"Hearing this, Bhima replied, 'If, sir, you know this house to be so<br>inflammable, it would then be well for us to return thither where we had<br>taken up our quarters first.' Yudhishthira replied, 'It seems to me that<br>we should rather continue to live here in seeming unsuspiciousness but<br>all the while with caution and our senses wide awake and seeking for some<br>certain means of escape. If Purochana findeth from our countenances that<br>we have fathomed designs, acting with haste he may suddenly burn us to<br>death. Indeed, Purochana careth little for obloquy or sin. The wretch<br>stayeth here acting under the instruction of Duryodhana. If we are burnt<br>to death, will our grandfather Bhishma be angry? Why will he, by showing<br>his wrath, make the Kauravas angry with him? Or, perhaps, our grandfather<br>Bhishma and the other bull of Kuru's race, regarding indignation at such<br>a sinful act to be virtuous, may become wrathful. If however, from fear<br>of being burnt, we fly from here, Duryodhana, ambitious of sovereignty<br>will certainly compass our death by means of spies. While we have no rank<br>and power, Duryodhana hath both; while we have no friends and allies,<br>Duryodhana hath both; while we are without wealth, Duryodhana hath at his<br>command a full treasury. Will he not, therefore, certainly destroy us by<br>adopting adequate means? Let us, therefore, by deceiving this wretch<br>(Purochana) and that other wretch Duryodhana, pass our days, disguising<br>ourselves at times. Let us also lead a hunting life, wandering over the<br>earth. We shall then, if we have to escape our enemies, be familiar with<br>all paths. We shall also, this very day, cause a subterranean passage to<br>be dug in our chamber in great secrecy. If we act in this way, concealing<br>what we do from all, fire shall never be able to consume us. We shall<br>live here, actively doing everything for our safety but with such privacy<br>that neither Purochana nor any of the citizens of Varanavata may know<br>what we are after.'"
