                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'After Dushmanta had left the asylum having made<br>those promises unto Sakuntala, the latter of tapering thighs brought<br>forth a boy of immeasurable energy. And when the child was three years<br>old, he became in splendour like the blazing fire. And, O Janamejaya, he<br>was possessed of beauty and magnanimity and every accomplishment. And<br>that first of virtuous men, Kanwa, caused all the rites of religion to be<br>performed in respect of that intelligent child thriving day by day. And<br>the boy gifted with pearly teeth and shining locks, capable of slaying<br>lions even then, with all auspicious signs on his palm, and broad<br>expansive forehead, grew up in beauty and strength. And like unto a<br>celestial child in splendour, he began to grow up rapidly. And when he<br>was only six years of age, endued with great strength he used to seize<br>and bind to the trees that stood around that asylum, lions and tigers and<br>bears and buffaloes and elephants. And he rode on some animals, and<br>pursued others in sportive mood. The dwellers at Kanwa's asylum thereupon<br>bestowed on him a name. And they said, because he seizes and restrains an<br>animals however strong, let him, be called Sarvadamana (the subduer of<br>all). And it was thus that the boy came to be named Sarvadamana, endued<br>as he was with prowess, and energy and strength. And the Rishi seeing the<br>boy and marking also his extraordinary acts, told Sakuntala that the time<br>had come for his installation as the heir-apparent. And beholding the<br>strength of the boy, Kanwa commanded his disciples, saying, 'Bear ye<br>without delay this Sakuntala with her son from this abode to that of her<br>husband, blessed with every auspicious sign. Women should not live long<br>in the houses of their paternal or maternal relations. Such residence is<br>destructive of their reputation, their good conduct, their virtue.<br>Therefore, delay not in bearing her hence.' These disciples of the Rishi<br>thereupon, saying 'So be it,' went towards the city named after an<br>elephant (Hastinapura) with Sakuntala and her son ahead of them. And then<br>she of fair eye-brows, taking with her that boy of celestial beauty,<br>endued with eyes like lotus petals, left the woods where she had been<br>first known by Dushmanta. And having approached the king, she with her<br>boy resembling in splendour the rising sun was introduced to him. And the<br>disciples of the Rishi having introduced her, returned to the asylum. And<br>Sakuntala having worshipped the king according to proper form, told him,<br>'This is thy son, O king! Let him be installed as thy heir-apparent. O<br>king, this child, like unto a celestial, hath been begotten by thee upon<br>me. Therefore, O best of men, fulfil now the promise thou gavest me. Call<br>to mind, O thou of great good fortune, the agreement thou hadst made on<br>the occasion of thy union with me in the asylum of Kanwa.'<br><br>"The king, hearing these her words, and remembering everything said, 'I<br>do not remember anything. Who art thou, O wicked woman in ascetic guise?<br>I do not remember having any connection with thee in respect of Dharma,<br>Kama and Arthas. Go or stay or do as thou pleasest.' Thus addressed by<br>him, the fair-coloured innocent one became abashed. Grief deprived her of<br>consciousness and she stood for a time like an wooden post. Soon,<br>however, her eyes became red like copper and her lips began to quiver.<br>And the glances she now and then cast upon the king seemed to burn the<br>latter. Her rising wrath however, and the fire of her asceticism, she<br>extinguished within herself by an extraordinary effort. Collecting her<br>thoughts in a moment, her heart possessed with sorrow and rage, she thus<br>addressed her lord in anger, looking at him, 'Knowing everything, O<br>monarch, how canst thou, like an inferior person, thus say that thou<br>knowest it not? Thy heart is a witness to the truth or falsehood of this<br>matter. Therefore, speak truly without degrading thyself. He who being<br>one thing representeth himself as another thing to others, is like a<br>thief and a robber of his own self. Of what sin is he not capable? Thou<br>thinkest that thou alone hast knowledge of thy deed. But knowest thou not<br>that the Ancient, Omniscient one (Narayana) liveth in thy heart? He<br>knoweth all thy sins, and thou sinnest in His presence. He that sins<br>thinks that none observes him. But he is observed by the gods and by Him<br>also who is in every heart. The Sun, the Moon, the Air, the Fire, the<br>Earth, the Sky, Water, the heart, Yama, the day, the night, both<br>twilights, and Dharma, all witness the acts of man. Yama, the son of<br>Surya, takes no account of the sins of him with whom Narayana the witness<br>of all acts, is gratified. But he with whom Narayana is not gratified is<br>tortured for his sins by Yama. Him who degradeth himself by representing<br>his self falsely, the gods never bless. Even his own soul blesseth him<br>not. I am a wife devoted to my husband. I have come of my own accord, it<br>is true. But do not, on that account, treat me with disrespect. I am thy<br>wife and, therefore, deserve to be treated respectfully. Wilt thou not<br>treat me so, because I have come hither of my own accord? In the presence<br>of so many, why dost thou treat me like an ordinary woman? I am not<br>certainly crying in the wilderness. Dost thou not hear me? But if thou<br>refuse to do what I supplicate thee for, O Dushmanta, thy head this<br>moment shall burst into a hundred pieces! The husband entering the womb<br>of the wife cometh out himself in the form of the son. Therefore is the<br>wife called by those cognisant of the Vedas as Jaya (she of whom one is<br>born). And the son that is so born unto persons cognisant of the Vedic<br>Mantras rescueth the spirits of deceased ancestors. And because the son<br>rescueth ancestors from the hell call Put, therefore, hath he been called<br>by the Self-create himself as Puttra (the rescuer from Put). By a son one<br>conquereth the three worlds. By a son's son, one enjoyeth eternity. And<br>by a grandson's son great-grand-fathers enjoy everlasting happiness. She<br>is a true wife who is skilful in household affairs. She is a true wife<br>who hath borne a son. She is a true wife whose heart is devoted to her<br>lord. She is a true wife who knoweth none but her lord. The wife is a<br>man's half. The wife is the first of friends. The wife is the root of<br>religion, profit, and desire. The wife is the root of salvation. They<br>that have wives can perform religious acts. They that have wives can lead<br>domestic lives. They that have wives have the means to be cheerful. They<br>that have wives can achieve good fortune. Sweet-speeched wives are<br>friends on occasions of joy. They are as fathers on occasions of<br>religious acts. They are mothers in sickness and woe. Even in the deep<br>woods to a traveller a wife is his refreshment and solace. He that hath a<br>wife is trusted by all. A wife, therefore, is one's most valuable<br>possession. Even when the husband leaving this world goeth into the<br>region of Yama, it is the devoted wife that accompanies him thither. A<br>wife going before waits for the husband. But if the husband goeth before,<br>the chaste wife followeth close. For these reasons, O king, doth marriage<br>exist. The husband enjoyth the companionship of the wife both in this and<br>in the other worlds. It hath been said by learned persons that one is<br>himself born as one's son. Therefore, a man whose wife hath borne a son<br>should look upon her as his mother. Beholding the face of the son one<br>hath begotten upon his wife, like his own face in a mirror, one feeleth<br>as happy as a virtuous man, on attaining to heaven. Men scorched by<br>mental grief, or suffering under bodily pain, feel as much refreshed in<br>the companionship of their wives as a perspiring person in a cool bath.<br>No man, even in anger, should ever do anything that is disagreeable to<br>his wife, seeing that happiness, joy, and virtue,&#8212;everything dependeth<br>on the wife. A wife is the sacred field in which the husband is born<br>himself. Even Rishis cannot create creatures without women. What<br>happiness is greater than what the father feeleth when the son running<br>towards him, even though his body be covered with dust, claspeth his<br>limbs? Why then dost thou treat with indifference such a son, who hath<br>approached thee himself and who casteth wistful glances towards thee for<br>climbing thy knees? Even ants support their own eggs without destroying<br>them; then why shouldst not thou, a virtuous man that thou art, support<br>thy own child? The touch of soft sandal paste, of women, of (cool) water<br>is not so agreeable as the touch of one's own infant son locked in one's<br>embrace. As a Brahmana is the foremost of all bipeds, a cow, the foremost<br>of all quadrupeds, a protector, the foremost of all superiors, so is the<br>son the foremost of all objects, agreeable to the touch. Let, therefore,<br>this handsome child touch thee in embrace. There is nothing in the world<br>more agreeable to the touch than the embrace of one's son. O chastiser of<br>foes, I have brought forth this child, O monarch, capable of dispelling<br>all thy sorrows after bearing him in my womb for full three years. O<br>monarch of Puru's race, 'He shall perform a hundred<br>horse-sacrifices'&#8212;these were the words uttered from the sky when I was<br>in the lying-in room. Indeed, men going into places remote from their<br>homes take up there others' children on their laps and smelling their<br>heads feel great happiness. Thou knowest that Brahmanas repeat these<br>Vedic mantras on the occasion of the consecrating rites of infancy.&#8212;Thou<br>art born, O son, of my body! Thou art sprung from my heart. Thou art<br>myself in the form of a son. Live thou to a hundred years! My life<br>dependeth on thee, and the continuation of my race also, on thee.<br>Therefore, O son, live thou in great happiness to a hundred years. He<br>hath sprung from thy body, this second being from thee! Behold thyself in<br>thy son, as thou beholdest thy image in the clear lake. As the<br>sacrificial fire is kindled from the domestic one, so hath this one<br>sprung from thee. Though one, thou hast divided thyself. In course of<br>hunting while engaged in pursuit of the deer, I was approached by thee, O<br>king, I who was then a virgin in the asylum of my father. Urvasi,<br>Purvachitti, Sahajanya, Menaka, Viswachi and Ghritachi, these are the six<br>foremost of Apsaras. Amongst them again, Menaka, born of Brahman, is the<br>first. Descending from heaven on Earth, after intercourse with<br>Viswamitra, she gave birth to me. That celebrated Apsara, Menaka, brought<br>me forth in a valley of Himavat. Bereft of all affection, she went away,<br>cast me there as if I were the child of somebody else. What sinful act<br>did I do, of old, in some other life that I was in infancy cast away by<br>my parents and at present am cast away by thee! Put away by thee, I am<br>ready to return to the refuge of my father. But it behoveth thee not to<br>cast off this child who is thy own.'<br><br>"Hearing all this, Dushmanta said, 'O Sakuntala, I do not know having<br>begot upon thee this son. Women generally speak untruths. Who shall<br>believe in thy words? Destitute of all affection, the lewd Menaka is thy<br>mother, and she cast thee off on the surface of the Himavat as one throws<br>away, after the worship is over, the flowery offering made to his gods.<br>Thy father too of the Kshatriya race, the lustful Viswamitra, who was<br>tempted to become a Brahmana, is destitute of all affection. However,<br>Menaka is the first of Apsaras, and thy father also is the first of<br>Rishis. Being their daughter, why dost thou speak like a lewd woman? Thy<br>words deserve no credit. Art thou not ashamed to speak them, especially<br>before me? Go hence, O wicked woman in ascetic guise. Where is that<br>foremost of great Rishis, where also is that Apsara Menaka? And why art<br>thou, low as thou art, in the guise of an ascetic? Thy child too is grown<br>up. Thou sayest he is a boy, but he is very strong. How hath he soon<br>grown like a Sala sprout? Thy birth is low. Thou speakest like a lewd<br>woman. Lustfully hast thou been begotten by Menaka. O woman of ascetic<br>guise, all that thou sayest is quite unknown to me. I don't know thee. Go<br>withersoever thou choosest.'<br><br>"Sakuntala replied, 'Thou seest, O king, the fault of others, even though<br>they be as small as a mustard seed. But seeing, thou noticest not thy own<br>faults even though they be as large as the Vilwa fruit. Menaka is one of<br>the celestials. Indeed, Menaka is reckoned as the first of celestials. My<br>birth, therefore, O Dushmanta, is far higher than thine. Thou walkest<br>upon the Earth, O king, but I roam in the skies! Behold, the difference<br>between ourselves is as that between (the mountain) Meru and a mustard<br>seed! Behold my power, O king! I can repair to the abodes of Indra,<br>Kuvera, Yama, and Varuna! The saying is true which I shall refer to<br>before thee, O sinless one! I refer to it for example's sake and not from<br>evil motives. Therefore, it behoveth thee to pardon me after thou hast<br>heard it. An ugly person considereth himself handsomer than others until<br>he sees his own face in the mirror. But when he sees his own ugly face in<br>the mirror, it is then that he perceiveth the difference between himself<br>and others. He that is really handsome never taunts anybody. And he that<br>always talketh evil becometh a reviler. And as the swine always look for<br>dirt and filth even when in the midst of a flower-garden, so the wicked<br>always choose the evil out of both evil and good that others speak.<br>Those, however, that are wise, on hearing the speeches of others that are<br>intermixed with both good and evil, accept only what is good, like geese<br>that always extract the milk only, though it be mixed with water. As the<br>honest are always pained at speaking ill of others, so do the wicked<br>always rejoice in doing the same thing. As the honest always feel<br>pleasure in showing regard for the old, so do the wicked always take<br>delight in aspersing the good. The honest are happy in not seeking for<br>faults. The wicked are happy in seeking for them. The wicked ever speak<br>ill of the honest. But the latter never injure the former, even if<br>injured by them. What can be more ridiculous in the world than that those<br>that are themselves wicked should represent the really honest as wicked?<br>When even atheists are annoyed with those that have fallen off from truth<br>and virtue and who are really like angry snakes of virulent poison, what<br>shall I say of myself who am nurtured in faith? He that having begotten a<br>son who is his own image, regardeth him not, never attaineth to the<br>worlds he coveteth, and verily the gods destroy his good fortune and<br>possessions. The Pitris have said that the son continueth the race and<br>the line and is, therefore, the best of all religious acts. Therefore,<br>none should abandon a son. Manu hath said that there are five kinds of<br>sons; those begotten by one's self upon his own wife, those obtained (as<br>gift) from others, those purchased for a consideration, those reared with<br>affection and those begotten upon other women than upon wedded wives.<br>Sons support the religion and achievements of men, enhance their joys,<br>and rescue deceased ancestors from hell. It behoveth thee not, therefore,<br>O tiger among kings, to abandon a son who is such. Therefore, O lord of<br>Earth, cherish thy own self, truth, and virtue by cherishing thy son. O<br>lion among monarchs, it behoveth thee not to support this deceitfulness.<br>The dedication of a tank is more meritorious than that of a hundred<br>wells. A sacrifice again is more meritorious than the dedication of a<br>tank. A son is more meritorious than a sacrifice. Truth is more<br>meritorious than a hundred sons. A hundred horse-sacrifices had once been<br>weighed against Truth, and Truth was found heavier than a hundred<br>horse-sacrifices. O king, Truth, I ween, may be equal to the study of,<br>the entire Vedas and ablutions in all holy places. There is no virtue<br>equal to Truth: there is nothing superior to Truth. O king, Truth is God<br>himself; Truth is the highest vow. Therefore, violate not thy pledge, O<br>monarch! Let Truth and thee be even united. If thou placest no credit in<br>my words, I shall of my own accord go hence. Indeed, thy companionship<br>should be avoided. But thou, O Dushmanta, that when thou art gone, this<br>son of mine shall rule the whole Earth surrounded by the four seas and<br>adorned with the king of the mountains."<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Sakuntala having spoken to the monarch in this<br>wise, left his presence. But as soon as she had left, a voice from the<br>skies, emanating from no visible shape, thus spoke unto Dushmanta as he<br>was sitting surrounded by his occasional and household priests, his<br>preceptors, and ministers. And the voice said, 'The mother is but the<br>sheath of flesh; the son sprung from the father is the father himself.<br>Therefore, O Dushmanta, cherish thy son, and insult not Sakuntala. O best<br>of men, the son, who is but a form of one's own seed, rescueth<br>(ancestors) from the region of Yama. Thou art the progenitor of this boy.<br>Sakuntala hath spoken the truth. The husband, dividing his body in twain,<br>is born of his wife in the form of son. Therefore, O Dushmanta, cherish,<br>O monarch, thy son born of Sakuntala. To live by forsaking one's living<br>son is a great, misfortune. Therefore, O thou of Puru's race, cherish thy<br>high-souled son born of Sakuntala&#8212;And because this child is to be<br>cherished by thee even at our word, therefore shall this thy son be known<br>by the name of Bharata (the cherished).' Hearing these words uttered by<br>the dwellers in heaven, the monarch of Puru's race became overjoyed and<br>spoke as follows unto his priests and ministers, 'Hear ye these words<br>uttered by the celestial messenger? I myself know this one to be my son.<br>If I had taken him as my son on the strength of Sakuntala's words alone,<br>my people would have been suspicious and my son also would not have been<br>regarded as pure.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The monarch, then, O thou of Bharata's race,<br>seeing the purity of his son established by the celestial messenger,<br>became exceedingly glad. And he took unto him that son with joy. And the<br>king with a joyous heart then performed all those rites upon his son that<br>a father should perform. And the king smelt his child's head and hugged<br>him with affection. And the Brahmanas began to utter blessings upon him<br>and the bards began to applaud him. And the monarch then experienced the<br>great delight that one feeleth at the touch of one's son. And Dushmanta<br>also received mat wife of his with affection. And he told her these<br>words, pacifying her affectionately, 'O goddess, my union with the? took<br>place privately Therefore, I was thinking of how best to establish thy<br>purity. My people might think that we were only lustfully united and not<br>as husband and wife, and therefore, this son that I would have installed<br>as my heir apparent would only have been regarded as one of impure birth.<br>And dearest, every hard word thou hast uttered in thy anger, have I, O<br>large-eyed one, forgiven thee. Thou art my dearest!' And the royal sage<br>Dushmanta, having spoken thus unto his dear wife, O Bharata, received her<br>with offerings of perfume, food, and drink. And king Dushmanta, then,<br>bestowed the name of Bharata upon his child, and formally installed him<br>as the heir apparent. And the famous and bright wheels of Bharata's car,<br>invincible and like unto the wheels of the cars owned by the gods,<br>traversed every region, filling the whole Earth with their rattle. And<br>the son of Dushmanta reduced to subjection all kings of the Earth. And he<br>ruled virtuously and earned great fame. And that monarch of great prowess<br>was known by the titles of Chakravarti and Sarvabhauma. And he performed<br>many sacrifices like Sakra, the lord of the Maruts. And Kanwa was the<br>chief priest at those sacrifices, in which the offerings to Brahmanas<br>were great. And the blessed monarch performed both the cow and the<br>horse-sacrifices. And Bharata gave unto Kanwa a thousand gold coins as<br>the sacerdotal fee. It is that Bharata from whom have emanated so many<br>mighty achievements. It is from him that the great race called after him<br>in his race are called after him. And in the Bharata race there have been<br>born many godlike monarchs gifted with great energy, and like unto<br>Brahman himself. Their number cannot be counted. But, O thou of Bharata's<br>race, I shall name the principal ones that were blessed with great good<br>fortune, like unto the gods, and devoted to truth and honesty.'"
