                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'After the death of that deer, king Pandu with his<br>wives was deeply afflicted and wept bitterly. And he exclaimed, 'The<br>wicked, even if born in virtuous families, deluded by their own passions,<br>become overwhelmed with misery as the fruit of their own deeds. I have<br>heard that my father, though begotten by Santanu of virtuous soul, was<br>cut off while still a youth, only because he had become a slave to his<br>lust. In the soil of that lustful king, the illustrious Rishi<br>Krishna-Dwaipayana himself, of truthful speech, begot me. A son though I<br>am of such a being, with my wicked heart wedded to vice, I am yet leading<br>a wandering life in the woods in the chase of the deer. Oh, the very gods<br>have forsaken me! I shall seek salvation now. The great impediments to<br>salvation are the desire to beget children, and other concerns of the<br>world. I shall now adopt the Brahmacharya mode of life and follow in the<br>imperishable wake of my father. I shall certainly bring my passions under<br>complete control by severe ascetic penances. Forsaking my wives and other<br>relatives and shaving my head, alone shall I wander over the earth,<br>begging for my subsistence from each of these trees standing here.<br>Forsaking every object of affection and aversion, and covering my body<br>with dust, I shall make the shelter of trees or deserted houses my home.<br>I shall never yield to influence of sorrow or joy, and I shall regard<br>slander and eulogy in the same light. I shall not seek benedictions or<br>bows. I shall be at peace with all, and shall not accept gifts. I shall<br>not mock anybody, nor shall I knit my brows at any one, but shall be ever<br>cheerful and devoted to the good of all creatures. I shall not harm any<br>of the four orders of life gifted with power of locomotion or otherwise,<br>viz., oviparous and viviparous creatures and worms and vegetables. But on<br>the contrary, preserve an equality of behaviour towards all, as if they<br>were, my own children. Once a day shall I beg of five or ten families at<br>the most, and if I do not succeed in obtaining alms, I shall then go<br>without food. I shall rather stint myself than beg more than once of the<br>same person. If I do not obtain anything after completing my round of<br>seven or ten houses, moved by covetousness, I shall not enlarge my round.<br>Whether I obtain or fail to obtain alms. I shall be equally unmoved like<br>a great ascetic. One lopping off an arm of mine with a hatchet, and one<br>smearing another arm with sandal-paste, shall be regarded by me equally.<br>I shall not wish prosperity to the one or misery to the other. I shall<br>not be pleased with life or displeased with death. I shall neither desire<br>to live nor to die. Washing my heart of all sins, I shall certainly<br>transcend those sacred rites productive of happiness, that men perform in<br>auspicious moments, days, and periods. I shall also abstain from all acts<br>of religion and profit and also those that lead to the gratification of<br>the senses. Freed from all sins and snares of the world, I shall be like<br>the wind subject to none. Following the path of fearlessness and bearing<br>myself in this way I shall at last lay down my life. Destitute of the<br>power of begetting children, firmly adhering to the line of duty I shall<br>not certainly deviate therefrom in order to tread in the vile path of the<br>world that is so full of misery. Whether respected or disrespected in the<br>world that man who from covetousness casteth on others a begging look,<br>certainly behaveth like a dog. (Destitute as I am of the power of<br>procreation, I should not certainly, from desire of offspring, solicit<br>others to give me children).'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The king, having thus wept in sorrow, with a<br>sigh looked at his two wives Kunti and Madri, and addressing them said,<br>'Let the princess of Kosala (my mother), Vidura, the king with our<br>friends, the venerable Satyavati, Bhishma, the priests of our family,<br>illustrious Soma-drinking Brahmanas of rigid vows and all elderly<br>citizens depending on us be informed, after being prepared for it, that<br>Pandu hath retired into the woods to lead a life of asceticism.' Hearing<br>these words of their lord who had set his heart on a life of asceticism<br>in the woods, both Kunti and Madri addressed him in these proper words,<br>'O bull of Bharata's race, there are many other modes of life which thou<br>canst adopt and in which thou canst undergo the severest penances along<br>with us, thy wedded wives&#8212;in which for the salvation of thy body<br>(freedom from re-birth), thou mayest obtain heaven. We also, in the<br>company of our lord, and for his benefit, controlling our passions and<br>bidding adieu to all luxuries, shall subject ourselves to the severest<br>austerities. O king, O thou of great wisdom, if thou abandonest us, we<br>shall then this very day truly depart from this world.'<br><br>Pandu replied, 'If, indeed, this your resolve springeth from virtue, then<br>with you both I shall follow the imperishable path of my fathers.<br>Abandoning the luxuries of cities and towns, clad in barks of trees, and<br>living on fruits and roots, I shall wander in deep woods, practising the<br>severest penances. Bathing morning and evening, I shall perform the homa.<br>I shall reduce my body by eating very sparingly and shall wear rags and<br>skins and knotted locks on my head. Exposing myself to heat and cold and<br>disregarding hunger and thirst, I shall reduce my body by severe ascetic<br>penances, I shall live in solitude and I shall give myself up to<br>contemplation; I shall eat fruit, ripe or green, that I may find. I shall<br>offer oblations to the Pitris (manes) and the gods with speech, water and<br>the fruits of the wilderness. I shall not see, far less harm, any of the<br>denizens of the woods, or any of my relatives, or any of the residents of<br>cities and towns. Until I lay down this body, I shall thus practise the<br>severe ordinances of the Vanaprastha scriptures, always searching for<br>severer ones that they may contain.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The Kuru king, having said this unto his wives,<br>gave away to Brahmanas the big jewel in his diadem, his necklace of<br>precious gold, his bracelets, his large ear-rings, his valuable robes and<br>all the ornaments of his wives. Then summoning his attendants, he<br>commended them, saying, 'Return ye to Hastinapura and proclaim unto all<br>that Pandu with his wives hath gone into the woods, foregoing wealth,<br>desire, happiness, and even sexual appetite.' Then those followers and<br>attendants, hearing these and other soft words of the king, set up a loud<br>wail, uttering, 'Oh, we are undone!' Then with hot tears trickling down<br>their cheeks they left the monarch and returned to Hastinapura with speed<br>carrying that wealth with them (that was to be distributed in charity).<br>Then Dhritarashtra, that first of men, hearing from them everything that<br>had happened in the woods, wept for his brother. He brooded over his<br>affliction continually, little relishing the comfort of beds and seats<br>and dishes.<br><br>"Meanwhile, the Kuru prince Pandu (after sending away his attendants)<br>accompanied by his two wives and eating fruits and roots went to the<br>mountains of Nagasata. He next went to Chaitraratha, and then crossed the<br>Kalakuta, and finally, crossing the Himavat, he arrived at Gandhamadana.<br>Protected by Mahabhutas, Siddhas, and great Rishis, Pandu lived, O king,<br>sometimes on level ground and sometimes on mountain slopes. He then<br>journeyed on to the lake of Indradyumna, whence crossing the mountains of<br>Hansakuta, he went to the mountain of hundred peaks (Sata-sringa) and<br>there continued to practise ascetic austerities.'"
