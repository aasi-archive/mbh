                            (Rajya-labha Parva)<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'O thou possessed of ascetic wealth, what did those<br>high-souled ones, my grandsires, the illustrious Pandavas, do, after<br>obtaining the kingdom of Indraprastha? How did their wife Draupadi obey<br>them all? How is it also that no dissensions arose amongst those<br>illustrious rulers of men, all attached to one wife, viz., Krishna? O<br>thou of the wealth of asceticism, I wish to hear everything in detail<br>regarding the behaviour towards one another of those rulers of men after<br>their union with Krishna.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Those scorchers of foes, the Pandavas, having<br>obtained their kingdom, at the command of Dhritarashtra, passed their<br>days in joy and happiness at Khandavaprastha with Krishna. And<br>Yudhishthira. endued with great energy and ever adhering to truth, having<br>obtained the sovereignty, virtuously ruled the land, assisted by his<br>brothers. And the sons of Pandu, endued with great wisdom and devoted to<br>truth and virtue, having vanquished all their foes, continued to live<br>there in great happiness. And those bulls among men, seated on royal<br>seats of great value, used to discharge all the duties of government. And<br>one day, while all those illustrious heroes were so seated, there came<br>unto them the celestial Rishi Narada, in course of his wanderings.<br>Beholding the Rishi, Yudhishthira offered him his own handsome seat. And<br>after the celestial Rishi had been seated, the wise Yudhishthira duly<br>offered him the Arghya with his own hands. And the king also informed the<br>Rishi of the state of his kingdom. The Rishi accepting the worship,<br>became well-pleased, and eulogising him with benedictions, commanded the<br>king to take his seat. Commanded by the Rishi, the king took his seat.<br>Then the king sent word unto Krishna (in the inner apartments) of the<br>arrival of the illustrious one. Hearing of the Rishi's arrival Draupadi,<br>purifying herself properly, came with a respectful attitude to where<br>Narada was with the Pandavas. The virtuous princess of Panchala,<br>worshipping the celestial Rishi's feet, stood with joined hands before<br>him, properly veiled, The illustrious Narada, pronouncing various<br>benedictions on her, commanded the princess to retire. After Krishna had<br>retired, the illustrious Rishi, addressing in private all the Pandavas<br>with Yudhishthira at their head, said, 'The renowned princess of Panchala<br>is the wedded wife of you all. Establish a rule amongst yourselves so<br>that disunion may not arise amongst you. There were, in former days,<br>celebrated throughout the three worlds, two brothers named Sunda and<br>Upasunda living together and incapable of being slain by anybody unless<br>each slew the other. They ruled the same kingdom, lived in the same<br>house, slept on the same bed, sat on the same seat, and ate from the same<br>dish. And yet they killed each for the sake of Tilottama. Therefore, O<br>Yudhishthira, preserve your friendship for one another and do that which<br>may not produce disunion amongst you.'<br><br>"On hearing this, Yudhishthira asked, 'O great Muni, whose sons were<br>Asuras called Sunda and Upasunda? Whence arose that dissension amongst<br>them, and why did they slay each other? Whose daughter also was this<br>Tilottama for whose love the maddened brothers killed each other? Was she<br>an Apsara (water nymph) or the daughter of any celestial? O thou whose<br>wealth is asceticism, we desire, O Brahmana, to hear in detail everything<br>as it happened. Indeed, our curiosity hath become great.'"
