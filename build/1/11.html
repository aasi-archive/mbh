                            (Pauloma Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti continued 'The Dundubha then said, 'In former times, I had a<br>friend Khagama by name. He was impetuous in his speech and possessed of<br>spiritual power by virtue of his austerities. And one day when he was<br>engaged in the Agni-hotra (Fire-sacrifice), I made a mock snake of blades<br>of grass, and in a frolic attempted to frighten him with it. And anon he<br>fell into a swoon. On recovering his senses, that truth-telling and<br>vow-observing ascetic, burning with wrath, exclaimed, 'Since thou hast<br>made a powerless mock snake to frighten me, thou shalt be turned even<br>into a venomless serpent thyself by my curse.' O ascetic, I well knew the<br>power of his penances; therefore with an agitated heart, I addressed him<br>thus, bending low with joined hands, 'Friend, I did this by way of a<br>joke, to excite thy laughter. It behoveth thee to forgive me and revoke<br>thy curse.' And seeing me sorely troubled, the ascetic was moved, and he<br>replied, breathing hot and hard. 'What I have said must come to pass.<br>Listen to what I say and lay it to thy heart. O pious one! when Ruru the<br>pure son of Pramati, will appear, thou shall be delivered from the curse<br>the moment thou seest him. Thou art the very Ruru and the son of Pramati.<br>On regaining my native form, I will tell thee something for thy good.<br><br>"And that illustrious man and the best of Brahmanas then left his<br>snake-body, and attained his own form and original brightness. He then<br>addressed the following words to Ruru of incomparable power, 'O thou<br>first of created beings, verily the highest virtue of man is sparing the<br>life of others. Therefore a Brahmana should never take the life of any<br>creature. A Brahmana should ever be mild. This is the most sacred<br>injunction of the Vedas. A Brahmana should be versed in the Vedas and<br>Vedangas, and should inspire all creatures with belief in God. He should<br>be benevolent to all creatures, truthful, and forgiving, even as it is<br>his paramount duty to retain the Vedas in his memory. The duties of the<br>Kshatriya are not thine. To be stern, to wield the sceptre and to rule<br>the subjects properly are the duties of the Kshatriya. Listen, O Ruru, to<br>the account of the destruction of snakes at the sacrifice of Janamejaya<br>in days of yore, and the deliverance of the terrified reptiles by that<br>best of Dwijas, Astika, profound in Vedic lore and might in spiritual<br>energy.'"<br><br>And so ends the eleventh section of the Pauloma Parva of the Adi Parva.
