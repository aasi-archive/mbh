                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'In olden days, Rama, the son of Jamadagni, in anger<br>at the death of his father, slew with his battle axe the king of the<br>Haihayas. And Rama, by cutting off the thousand arms of Arjuna (the<br>Haihaya king), achieved a most difficult feat in the world. Not content<br>with this, he set out on his chariot for the conquest of the world, and<br>taking up his bow he cast around his mighty weapons to exterminate the<br>Kshatriyas. And the illustrious scion of Bhrigu's race, by means of his<br>swift arrows annihilated the Kshatriya tribe one and twenty times.<br><br>"And when the earth was thus deprived of Kshatriyas by the great Rishi,<br>the Kshatriya ladies all over the land had offspring raised by Brahmanas<br>skilled in the Vedas. It has been said in the Vedas that the sons so<br>raised belongeth to him that had married the mother. And the Kshatriya<br>ladies went in unto the Brahamanas not lustfully but from motives of<br>virtue. Indeed, it was thus that the Kshatriya race was revived.<br><br>"In this connection there is another old history that I will recite to<br>you. There was in olden days a wise Rishi of the name of Utathya. He had<br>a wife of the name Mamata whom he dearly loved. One day Utathya's younger<br>brother Vrihaspati, the priest of the celestials, endued with great<br>energy, approached Mamata. The latter, however, told her husband's<br>younger brother&#8212;that foremost of eloquent men&#8212;that she had conceived<br>from her connection with his elder brother and that, therefore, he should<br>not then seek for the consummation of his wishes. She continued, 'O<br>illustrious Vrihaspati, the child that I have conceived hath studied in<br>his mother's womb the Vedas with the six Angas, Semen tuum frustra perdi<br>non potest. How can then this womb of mine afford room for two children<br>at a time? Therefore, it behoveth thee not to seek for the consummation<br>of thy desire at such a time. Thus addressed by her, Vrihaspati, though<br>possessed of great wisdom, succeeded not in suppressing his desire. Quum<br>auten jam cum illa coiturus esset, the child in the womb then addressed<br>him and said, 'O father, cease from thy attempt. There is no space here<br>for two. O illustrious one, the room is small. I have occupied it first.<br>Semen tuum perdi non potest. It behoveth thee not to afflict me.' But<br>Vrihaspati without listening to what that child in the womb said, sought<br>the embraces of Mamata possessing the most beautiful pair of eyes. Ille<br>tamen Muni qui in venture erat punctum temporis quo humor vitalis jam<br>emissum iret providens, viam per quam semen intrare posset pedibus<br>obstruxit. Semen ita exhisum, excidit et in terram projectumest. And the<br>illustrious Vrihaspati, beholding this, became indignant, and reproached<br>Utathya's child and cursed him, saying, 'Because thou hast spoken to me<br>in the way thou hast at a time of pleasure that is sought after by all<br>creatures, perpetual darkness shall overtake thee.' And from this curse<br>of the illustrious Vrishaspati Utathya's child who was equal unto<br>Vrihaspati in energy, was born blind and came to be called Dirghatamas<br>(enveloped in perpetual darkness). And the wise Dirghatamas, possessed of<br>a knowledge of the Vedas, though born blind, succeeded yet by virtue of<br>his learning, in obtaining for a wife a young and handsome Brahmana<br>maiden of the name of Pradweshi. And having married her, the illustrious<br>Dirghatamas, for the expansion of Utathya's race, begat upon her several<br>children with Gautama as their eldest. These children, however, were all<br>given to covetousness and folly. The virtuous and illustrious Dirghatamas<br>possessing complete mastery over the Vedas, soon after learnt from<br>Surabhi's son the practices of their order and fearlessly betook himself<br>to those practices, regarding them with reverence. (For shame is the<br>creature of sin and can never be where there is purity of intention).<br>Then those best of Munis that dwelt in the same asylum, beholding him<br>transgress the limits of propriety became indignant, seeing sin where sin<br>was not. And they said, 'O, this man, transgresseth the limit of<br>propriety. No longer doth he deserve a place amongst us. Therefore, shall<br>we all cast this sinful wretch off.' And they said many other things<br>regarding the Muni Dirghatamas. And his wife, too, having obtained<br>children, became indignant with him.<br><br>"The husband then addressing his wife Pradweshi, said, 'Why is it that<br>thou also hast been dissatisfied with me?' His wife answered, 'The<br>husband is called the Bhartri because he supporteth the wife. He is<br>called Pati because he protecteth her. But thou art neither, to me! O<br>thou of great ascetic merit, on the other hand, thou hast been blind from<br>birth, it is I who have supported thee and thy children. I shall not do<br>so in future.'<br><br>"Hearing these words of his wife, the Rishi became indignant and said<br>unto her and her children, 'Take me unto the Kshatriyas and thou shalt<br>then be rich.' His wife replied (by saying), 'I desire not wealth that<br>may be procured by thee, for that can never bring me happiness. O best of<br>Brahmanas, do as thou likest. I shall not be able to maintain thee as<br>before.' At these words of his wife, Dirghatamas said, 'I lay down from<br>this day as a rule that every woman shall have to adhere to one husband<br>for her life. Be the husband dead or alive, it shall not be lawful for a<br>woman to have connection with another. And she who may have such<br>connection shall certainly be regarded as fallen. A woman without husband<br>shall always be liable to be sinful. And even if she be wealthy she shall<br>not be able to enjoy that wealth truly. Calumny and evil report shall<br>ever dog her.' Hearing these words of her husband Pradweshi became very<br>angry, and commanded her sons, saying, 'Throw him into the waters of<br>Ganga!' And at the command of their mother, the wicked Gautama and his<br>brothers, those slaves of covetousness and folly, exclaiming, 'Indeed,<br>why should we support this old man?&#8212;'tied the Muni to a raft and<br>committing him to the mercy of the stream returned home without<br>compunction. The blind old man drifting along the stream on that raft,<br>passed through the territories of many kings. One day a king named Vali<br>conversant with every duty went to the Ganges to perform his ablutions.<br>And as the monarch was thus engaged, the raft to which the Rishi was<br>tied, approached him. And as it came, the king took the old man. The<br>virtuous Vali, ever devoted to truth, then learning who the man was that<br>was thus saved by him, chose him for raising up offspring. And Vali said,<br>'O illustrious one, it behoveth thee to raise upon my wife a few sons<br>that shall be virtuous and wise.' Thus addressed, the Rishi endued with<br>great energy, expressed his willingness. Thereupon king Vali sent his<br>wife Sudeshna unto him. But the queen knowing that the latter was blind<br>and old went not unto him, she sent unto him her nurse. And upon that<br>Sudra woman the virtuous Rishi of passions under full control begat<br>eleven children of whom Kakshivat was the eldest. And beholding those<br>eleven sons with Kakshivat as the eldest, who had studied all the Vedas<br>and who like Rishis were utterers of Brahma and were possessed of great<br>power, king Vali one day asked the Rishi saying, 'Are these children<br>mine?' The Rishi replied, 'No, they are mine. Kakshivat and others have<br>been begotten by me upon a Sudra woman. Thy unfortunate queen Sudeshna,<br>seeing me blind and old, insulted me by not coming herself but sending<br>unto me, instead, her nurse.' The king then pacified that best of Rishis<br>and sent unto him his queen Sudeshna. The Rishi by merely touching her<br>person said to her, 'Thou shalt have five children named Anga, Vanga,<br>Kalinga, Pundra and Suhma, who shall be like unto Surya (Sun) himself in<br>glory. And after their names as many countries shall be known on earth.<br>It is after their names that their dominions have come to be called Anga,<br>Vanga, Kalinga, Pundra and Suhma.'<br><br>"It was thus that the line of Vali was perpetuated, in days of old, by a<br>great Rishi. And it was thus also that many mighty bowmen and great<br>car-warriors wedded to virtue, sprung in the Kshatriya race from the seed<br>of Brahmanas. Hearing this, O mother, do as thou likest, as regards the<br>matter in hand.'"
