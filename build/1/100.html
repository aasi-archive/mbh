                            (Sambhava Parva continued )<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'The monarch Santanu, the most adored of the gods and<br>royal sages, was known in all the worlds for his wisdom, virtues, and<br>truthfulness (of speech). The qualities of self-control, liberality,<br>forgiveness, intelligence, modesty, patience and superior energy ever<br>dwelt in that bull among men, viz., Santanu, that great being endued with<br>these accomplishments and conversant with both religion and profit, the<br>monarch was at once the protector of the Bharata race and all human<br>beings. His neck was marked with (three) lines, like a conch-shell; his<br>shoulders were broad, and he resembled in prowess an infuriated elephant.<br>It would seem that all the auspicious signs of royalty dwelt in his<br>person, considering that to be their fittest abode. Men, seeing the<br>behaviour of that monarch of great achievements came to know that virtue<br>was ever superior to pleasure and profit. These were the attributes that<br>dwelt in that great being&#8212;that bull among men&#8212;Santanu. And truly there<br>was never a king like Santanu. All the kings of the earth, beholding him<br>devoted to virtue, bestowed upon that foremost of virtuous men the title<br>of King of kings. And all the kings of the earth during the time of that<br>lord-protector of the Bharata race, were without woe and fear and anxiety<br>of any kind. And they all slept in peace, rising from bed every morning<br>after happy dreams. And owing to that monarch of splendid achievements<br>resembling Indra himself in energy, all the kings of the earth became<br>virtuous and devoted to liberality, religious acts and sacrifices. And<br>when the earth was ruled by Santanu and other monarchs like him, the<br>religious merits of every order increased very greatly. The Kshatriyas<br>served the Brahmanas; the Vaisyas waited upon the Kshatriyas, and the<br>Sudras adoring the Brahmanas and the Kshatriyas, waited upon the Vaisyas.<br>And Santanu residing in Hastinapura, the delightful capital of the Kurus,<br>ruled the whole earth bounded by seas. He was truthful and guileless, and<br>like the king of the celestials himself conversant with the dictates of<br>virtue. And from the combination in him of liberality, religion and<br>asceticism, he acquired a great good fortune. He was free from anger and<br>malice, and was handsome in person like Soma himself. In splendour he was<br>like the Sun and in impetuosity of valour like Vayu. In wrath he was like<br>Yama, and in patience like the Earth. And, O king, while Santanu ruled<br>the earth, no deer, boars, birds, or other animals were needlessly slain.<br>In his dominions the great virtue of kindness to all creatures prevailed,<br>and the king himself, with the soul of mercy, and void of desire and<br>wrath, extended equal protection unto all creatures. Then sacrifices in<br>honour of the gods, the Rishis, and Pitris commenced, and no creature was<br>deprived of life sinfully. And Santanu was the king and father of all&#8212;of<br>those that were miserable and those that had no protectors, of birds and<br>beasts, in fact, of every created thing. And during the rule of the best<br>of Kurus&#8212;of that king of kings&#8212;speech became united with truth, and the<br>minds of men were directed towards liberality and virtue. And Santanu,<br>having enjoyed domestic felicity for six and thirty years, retired into<br>the woods.<br><br>"And Santanu's son, the Vasu born of Ganga, named Devavrata resembled<br>Santanu himself in personal beauty, in habits and behaviour, and in<br>learning. And in all branches of knowledge worldly or spiritual his skill<br>was very great. His strength and energy were extraordinary. He became a<br>mighty car-warrior. In fact he was a great king.<br><br>"One day, while pursuing along the banks of the Ganges a deer that he had<br>struck with his arrow, king Santanu observed that the river had become<br>shallow. On observing this, that bull among men, viz., Santanu, began to<br>reflect upon this strange phenomenon. He mentally asked why that first of<br>rivers ran out so quickly as before. And while seeking for a cause, the<br>illustrious monarch beheld that a youth of great comeliness, well-built<br>and amiable person, like Indra himself, had, by his keen celestial<br>weapon, checked the flow of the river. And the king, beholding this<br>extraordinary feat of the river Ganga having been checked in her course<br>near where that youth stood, became very much surprised. This youth was<br>no other than Santanu's son himself. But as Santanu had seen his son only<br>once a few moments after his birth, he had not sufficient recollection to<br>identify that infant with the youth before his eyes. The youth, however,<br>seeing his father, knew him at once, but instead of disclosing himself,<br>he clouded the king's perception by his celestial powers of illusion and<br>disappeared in his very sight.<br><br>"King Santanu, wondering much at what he saw and imagining the youth to<br>be his own son then addressed Ganga and said, 'Show me that child.' Ganga<br>thus addressed, assuming a beautiful form, and holding the boy decked<br>with ornaments in her right arm, showed him to Santanu. And Santanu did<br>not recognise that beautiful female bedecked with ornaments and attired<br>in fine robes of white, although he had known her before. And Ganga said,<br>'O tiger among men, that eighth son whom thou hadst some time before<br>begat upon me is this. Know that this excellent child is conversant with<br>all weapons, O monarch, take him now. I have reared him with care. And go<br>home, O tiger among men, taking him with thee. Endued with superior<br>intelligence, he has studied with Vasishtha the entire Vedas with their<br>branches. Skilled in all weapons and a mighty bowman, he is like Indra in<br>battle. And, O Bharata, both the gods and the Asuras look upon him with<br>favour. Whatever branches of knowledge are known to Usanas, this one<br>knoweth completely. And so is he the master of all those Sastras that the<br>son of Angiras (Vrihaspati) adored by the gods and the Asuras, knoweth.<br>And all the weapons known to the powerful and invincible Rama, the son of<br>Jamadagni are known to this thy illustrious son of mighty arms. O king of<br>superior courage, take this thy own heroic child given unto thee by me.<br>He is a mighty bowman and conversant with the interpretation of all<br>treatises on the duties of a king.' Thus commanded by Ganga, Santanu took<br>his child resembling the Sun himself in glory and returned to his<br>capital. And having reached his city that was like unto the celestial<br>capital, that monarch of Puru's line regarded himself greatly fortunate.<br>And having summoned all the Pauravas together, for the protection of his<br>kingdom he installed his son as his heir-apparent. And O bull of<br>Bharata's race, the prince soon gratified by his behaviour his father and<br>the other members of the Paurava race: in fact, all the subjects of the<br>kingdom. And the king of incomparable prowess lived happily with that son<br>of his.<br><br>"Four years had thus passed away, when the king one day went into the<br>woods on the bank of the Yamuna. And while the king was rambling there,<br>he perceived a sweet scent coming from an unknown direction. And the<br>monarch, impelled by the desire of ascertaining the cause, wandered<br>hither and thither. And in course of his ramble, he beheld a black-eyed<br>maiden of celestial beauty, the daughter of a fisherman. The king<br>addressing her, said, 'Who art thou, and whose daughter? What dost thou<br>do here, O timid one?' She answered, 'Blest be thou! I am the daughter of<br>the chief of the fishermen. At his command, I am engaged for religious<br>merit, in rowing passengers across this river in my boat.' And Santanu,<br>beholding that maiden of celestial form endued with beauty, amiableness,<br>and such fragrance, desired her for his wife. And repairing unto her<br>father, the king solicited his consent to the proposed match. But the<br>chief of the fishermen replied to the monarch, saying, 'O king, as soon<br>as my daughter of superior complexion was born, it was of course,<br>understood that she should be bestowed upon a husband. But listen to the<br>desire I have cherished all along in my heart. O sinless one, thou art<br>truthful: if thou desirest to obtain this maiden as a gift from me, give,<br>me then this pledge. If, indeed, thou givest the pledge, I will of course<br>bestow my daughter upon thee for truly I can never obtain a husband for<br>her equal to thee.'<br><br>"Santanu, hearing this, replied, 'When I have heard of the pledge thou<br>askest, I shall then say whether I would be able to grant it. If it is<br>capable of being granted, I shall certainly grant it. Otherwise how shall<br>I grant it.' The fisherman said, 'O king, what I ask of thee is this: the<br>son born of this maiden shall be installed by thee on thy throne and none<br>else shall thou make thy successor.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'O Bharata, when Santanu heard this, he felt no<br>inclination to grant such a boon, though the fire of desire sorely burnt<br>him within. The king with his heart afflicted by desire returned to<br>Hastinapura, thinking all the way of the fisherman's daughter. And having<br>returned home, the monarch passed his time in sorrowful meditation. One<br>day, Devavrata approaching his afflicted father said, 'All is prosperity<br>with thee; all chiefs obey thee; then how is it that thou grievest thus?<br>Absorbed in thy own thoughts, thou speakest not a word to me in reply.<br>Thou goest not out on horse-back now; thou lookest pale and emaciated,<br>having lost all animation. I wish to know the disease thou sufferest<br>from, so that I may endeavour to apply a remedy.' Thus addressed by his<br>son, Santanu answered, 'Thou sayest truly, O son, that I have become<br>melancholy. I will also tell thee why I am so. O thou of Bharata's line,<br>thou art the only scion of this our large race. Thou art always engaged<br>in sports of arms and achievements of prowess. But, O son, I am always<br>thinking of the instability of human life. If any danger overtake thee, O<br>child of Ganga, the result is that we become sonless. Truly thou alone<br>art to me as a century of sons. I do not, therefore, desire to wed again.<br>I only desire and pray that prosperity may ever attend thee so that our<br>dynasty may be perpetuated. The wise say that he that hath one son hath<br>no son. Sacrifices before fire and the knowledge of the three Vedas<br>yield, it is true, everlasting religious merit, but all these, in point<br>of religious merit, do not, come up to a sixteenth part of the religious<br>merit attainable on the birth of a son. Indeed, in this respect, there is<br>hardly any difference between men and the lower animals. O wise one, I do<br>not entertain a shadow of doubt that one attains to heaven in consequence<br>of his having begotten a son. The Vedas which constitute the root of the<br>Puranas and are regarded as authoritative even by the gods, contain<br>numerous proof of this. O thou of Bharata's race, thou art a hero of<br>excitable temper, who is always engaged in the exercise of arms. It is<br>very probable that thou wilt be slain on the field of battle. If it so<br>happen, what then will be the state of the Bharata dynasty, It is this<br>thought that hath made me so melancholy. I have now told thee fully the<br>causes of my sorrow.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Devavrata who was endued with great<br>intelligence, having ascertained all this from the king, reflected within<br>himself for a while. He then went to the old minister devoted to his<br>father's welfare and asked him about the cause of the king's grief. O<br>bull of Bharata's race, when the prince questioned the minister, the<br>latter told him about the boon that was demanded by the chief of the<br>fishermen in respect of his daughter Gandhavati. Then Devavrata,<br>accompanied by many Kshatriya chiefs of venerable age, personally<br>repaired to the chief of the fishermen and begged of him his daughter on<br>behalf of the king. The chief of the fishermen received him with due<br>adorations, and, O thou of Bharata's race, when the prince took his seat<br>in the court of the chief, the latter addressed him and said, 'O bull<br>among the Bharatas, thou art the first of all wielders of weapons and the<br>only son of Santanu. Thy power is great. But I have something to tell<br>thee. If the bride's father was Indra himself, even then he would have to<br>repent of rejecting such an exceedingly honourable and desirable proposal<br>of marriage. The great man of whose seed this celebrated maiden named<br>Satyavati was born, is, indeed, equal to you in virtue. He hath spoken to<br>me on many occasions of the virtues of thy father and told me that, the<br>king alone is worthy of (marrying) Satyavati. Let me tell you that I have<br>even rejected the solicitations of that best of Brahmarshis&#8212;the<br>celestial sage Asita&#8212;who, too, had often asked for Satyavati's hand in<br>marriage. I have only one word to say on the part of this maiden. In the<br>matter of the proposed marriage there is one great objection founded on<br>the fact of a rival in the person of a co-wife's son. O oppressor of all<br>foes, he hath no security, even if he be an Asura or a Gandharva, who<br>hath a rival in thee. There is this only objection to the proposed<br>marriage, and nothing else. Blest be thou! But this is all I have to say<br>in the matter of the bestowal or otherwise, of Satyavati.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'O thou of Bharata's race, Devavrata, having<br>heard these words, and moved by the desire of benefiting his father thus<br>answered in the hearing of the assembled chiefs, 'O foremost of truthful<br>men, listen to the vow I utter! The man has not been or will not be born,<br>who will have the courage to take such a vow! I shall accomplish all that<br>thou demandest! The son that may be born of this maiden shall be our<br>king.' Thus addressed, the chief of the fishermen, impelled by desire of<br>sovereignty (for his daughter's son), to achieve the almost impossible,<br>then said, 'O thou of virtuous soul, thou art come hither as full agent<br>on behalf of thy father Santanu of immeasurable glory; be thou also the<br>sole manager on my behalf in the matter of the bestowal of this my<br>daughter. But, O amiable one, there is something else to be said,<br>something else to be reflected upon by thee. O suppressor of foes, those<br>that have daughters, from the very nature of their obligations, must say<br>what I say. O thou that art devoted to truth, the promise thou hast given<br>in the presence of these chiefs for the benefit of Satyavati, hath,<br>indeed, been worthy of thee. O thou of mighty arms, I have not the least<br>doubt of its ever being violated by thee. But I have my doubts in respect<br>of the children thou mayst beget.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'O king, the son of Ganga, devoted to truth,<br>having ascertained the scruples of the chief of the fishermen, then said,<br>moved thereto by the desire of benefiting his father, 'Chief of<br>fishermen, thou best of men, listen to what I say in the presence of<br>these assembled kings. Ye kings, I have already relinquished my right to<br>the throne, I shall now settle the matter of my children. O fisherman,<br>from this day I adopt the vow of Brahmacharya (study and meditation in<br>celibacy). If I die sonless, I shall yet attain to regions of perennial<br>bliss in heaven!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Upon these words of the son of Ganga, the hair<br>on the fisherman's body stood on end from glee, and he replied, 'I bestow<br>my daughter!' Immediately after, the Apsaras and the gods with diverse<br>tribes of Rishis began to rain down flowers from the firmament upon the<br>head of Devavrata and exclaimed, 'This one is Bhishma (the terrible).'<br>Bhishma then, to serve his father, addressed the illustrious damsel and<br>said, 'O mother, ascend this chariot, and let us go unto our house.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said this, Bhishma helped the beautiful<br>maiden into his chariot. On arriving with her at Hastinapura, he told<br>Santanu everything as it had happened. And the assembled kings, jointly<br>and individually, applauded his extraordinary act and said, 'He is really<br>Bhishma (the terrible)!' And Santanu also, hearing of the extraordinary<br>achievements of his son, became highly gratified and bestowed upon the<br>high-souled prince the boon of death at will, saying, 'Death shall never<br>come to thee as long as thou desirest to live. Truly death shall approach<br>thee, O sinless one, having first obtained thy command.'"
