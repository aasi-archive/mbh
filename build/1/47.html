                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Then Vasuki spake unto the Rishi Jaratkaru these words, 'O<br>best of Brahmanas, this maiden is of the same name with thee. She is my<br>sister and hath ascetic merit. I will maintain thy wife; accept her. O<br>thou of ascetic wealth, I shall protect her with all my ability. And, O<br>foremost of the great Munis, she hath been reared by me for thee.' And<br>the Rishi replied, 'This is agreed between us that I shall not maintain<br>her; and she shall not do aught that I do not like. If she do, I leave<br>her!'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'When the snake had promised, saying, 'I shall maintain<br>my sister,' Jaratkaru then went to the snake's house. Then that first of<br>mantra-knowing Brahmanas, observing rigid vows, that virtuous and veteran<br>ascetic, took her hand presented to him according to shastric rites. And<br>taking his bride with him, adored by the great Rishi, he entered the<br>delightful chamber set apart for him by the king of the snakes. And in<br>that chamber was a bed-stead covered with very valuable coverlets. And<br>Jaratkaru lived there with his wife. And the excellent Rishi made an<br>agreement with his wife, saying, 'Nothing must ever be done or said by<br>thee that is against my liking. And in case of thy doing any such thing,<br>I will leave thee and no longer continue to stay in thy house. Bear in<br>mind these words that have been spoken by me.'<br><br>"And then the sister of the king of the snakes in great anxiety and<br>grieving exceedingly, spoke unto him, saying, 'Be it so.' And moved by<br>the desire of doing good to her relatives, that damsel, of unsullied<br>reputation, began to attend upon her lord with the wakefulness of a dog,<br>the timidity of a deer, and knowledge of signs possessed by the crow. And<br>one day, after the menstrual period, the sister of Vasuki, having<br>purified herself by a bath according to custom, approached her lord the<br>great Muni; And thereupon she conceived. And the embryo was like unto a<br>flame of fire, possessed of great energy, and resplendent as fire itself.<br>And it grew like the moon in the bright fortnight.<br><br>"And one day, within a short time, Jaratkaru of great fame, placing his<br>head on the lap of his wife, slept, looking like one fatigued. And as he<br>was sleeping, the sun entered his chambers in the Western mountain and<br>was about to set. And, O Brahmana, as the day was fading, she, the<br>excellent sister of Vasuki, became thoughtful, fearing the loss of her<br>husband's virtue. And she thought, 'What should I now do? Shall I wake my<br>husband or not? He is exacting and punctilious in his religious duties.<br>How can I act as not to offend him? The alternatives are his anger and<br>the loss of virtue of a virtuous man. The loss of virtue, I ween, is the<br>greater of the two evils. Again, if I wake him, he will be angry. But if<br>twilight passeth away without his prayers being said, he shall certainly<br>sustain loss of virtue.'<br><br>'And having resolved at last, the sweet-speeched Jaratkaru, the sister of<br>Vasuki, spake softly unto that Rishi resplendent with ascetic penances,<br>and lying prostrate like a flame of fire, 'O thou of great good fortune,<br>awake, the sun is setting. O thou of rigid vows, O illustrious one, do<br>your evening prayer after purifying yourself with water and uttering the<br>name of Vishnu. The time for the evening sacrifice hath come. Twilight, O<br>lord, is even now gently covering the western side.'<br><br>"The illustrious Jaratkaru of great ascetic merit, thus addressed, spake<br>unto his wife these words, his upper lip quivering in anger, 'O amiable<br>one of the Naga race, thou hast insulted me. I shall no longer abide with<br>thee, but shall go where I came from. O thou of beautiful thighs, I<br>believe in my heart that the sun hath no power to set in the usual time,<br>if I am asleep. An insulted person should never live where he hath met<br>with the insult, far less should I, a virtuous person, or those that are<br>like me.' Jaratkaru, the sister of Vasuki, thus addressed by her lord,<br>began to quake with terror, and she spake unto him, saying, 'O Brahmana,<br>I have not waked thee from desire of insult; but I have done it so that<br>thy virtue may not sustain any loss.'<br><br>"The Rishi Jaratkaru, great in ascetic merit, possessed with anger and<br>desirous of forsaking his spouse, thus addressed, spake unto his wife,<br>saying, O thou fair one, never have I spoken a falsehood. Therefore, go I<br>shall. This was also settled between ourselves. O amiable one, I have<br>passed the time happily with thee. And, O fair one, tell thy brother,<br>when I am gone, that I have left thee. And upon my going away, it<br>behoveth thee not to grieve for me.'<br><br>"Thus addressed Jaratkaru, the fair sister of Vasuki, of faultless<br>features, filled with anxiety and sorrow, having mustered sufficient<br>courage and patience, though her heart was still quaking, then spake unto<br>Rishi Jaratkaru. Her words were obstructed with tears and her face was<br>pale with fear. And the palms of her hands were joined together, and her<br>eyes were bathed in tears. And she said, 'It behoveth thee not to leave<br>me without a fault. Thou treadest over the path of virtue. I too have<br>been in the same path, with heart fixed on the good of my relatives. O<br>best of Brahmanas, the object for which I was bestowed on thee hath not<br>been accomplished yet. Unfortunate that I am, what shall Vasuki say unto<br>me? O excellent one, the offspring desired of by my relatives afflicted<br>by a mother's curse, do not yet appear! The welfare of my relatives<br>dependeth on the acquisition of offspring from thee. And in order that my<br>connection with thee may not be fruitless, O illustrious Brahmana, moved<br>by the desire of doing good to my race do I entreat thee. O excellent<br>one, high-souled thou art; so why shall thou leave me who am faultless?<br>This is what is not just clear to me.'<br><br>"Thus addressed, the Muni of great ascetic merit spake unto his wife<br>Jaratkaru these words that were proper and suitable to the occasion. And<br>he said, 'O fortunate one, the being thou hast conceived, even like unto<br>Agni himself is a Rishi of soul highly virtuous, and a master of the<br>Vedas and their branches.'<br><br>"Having said so, the great Rishi, Jaratkaru of virtuous soul, went away,<br>his heart firmly fixed on practising again the severest penances.'"
