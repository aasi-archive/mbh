                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Thus have I recited to you the whole story of how Amrita<br>was churned out of the Ocean, and the occasion on which the horse<br>Uchchaihsravas of great beauty and incomparable prowess was obtained. It<br>was this horse about which Kadru asked Vinata, saying, 'Tell me, amiable<br>sister, without taking much time, of what colour Uchchaishravas is.' And<br>Vinata answered, 'That prince of steeds is certainly white. What dost<br>thou think, sister? Say thou what is its colour. Let us lay a wager upon<br>it.' Kadru replied, then, 'O thou of sweet smiles. I think that horse is<br>black in its tail. Beauteous one, bet with me that she who loseth will<br>become the other's slave.'<br><br>'Sauti continued, 'Thus wagering with each other about menial service as<br>a slave, the sisters went home, and resolved to satisfy themselves by<br>examining the horse next day. And Kadru, bent upon practising a<br>deception, ordered her thousand sons to transform themselves into black<br>hair and speedily cover the horse's tail in order that she might not<br>become a slave. But her sons, the snakes, refusing to do her bidding, she<br>cursed them, saying, 'During the snake-sacrifice of the wise king<br>Janamejaya of the Pandava race, Agni shall consume you all.' And the<br>Grandsire (Brahman) himself heard this exceedingly cruel curse pronounced<br>by Kadru, impelled by the fates. And seeing that the snakes had<br>multiplied exceedingly, the Grandsire, moved by kind consideration for<br>his creatures, sanctioned with all the gods this curse of Kadru. Indeed,<br>as the snakes were of virulent poison, great prowess and excess of<br>strength, and ever bent on biting other creatures, their mother's conduct<br>towards them&#8212;those persecutors of all creatures,&#8212;was very proper for<br>the good of all creatures. Fate always inflicts punishment of death on<br>those who seek the death of other creatures. The gods, having exchanged<br>such sentiments with one another, supported Kadru's action (and went<br>away). And Brahman, calling Kasyapa to him, spake unto him these words,<br>'O thou pure one who overcomest all enemies, these snakes begotten by<br>you, who are of virulent poison and huge bodies, and ever intent on<br>biting other creatures, have been cursed by their mother. O son, do not<br>grieve for it in the least. The destruction of the snakes in the<br>sacrifice hath, indeed, been ordained long ago' Saying this, the divine<br>Creator of the Universe comforted Kasyapa and imparted to that<br>illustrious one the knowledge of neutralising poison."<br><br>And so ends the twentieth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.
