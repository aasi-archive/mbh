                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>Janamejaya said, 'Though this one is but a boy, he speaks yet like a wise<br>old man. He is not a boy but one wise and old. I think, I desire to<br>bestow on him a boon. Therefore, ye Brahmanas, give me the necessary<br>permission.'<br><br>"The Sadasyas said, 'A Brahmana, though a boy, deserves the respect of<br>kings. The learned ones do more so. This boy deserves every desire of his<br>being fulfilled by thee, but not before Takshaka comes with speed.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'The king, being inclined to grant the Brahmana a boon,<br>said 'Ask thou a boon.' The Hotri, however, being rather displeased,<br>said, 'Takshaka hath not come as yet into this sacrifice.'<br><br>"Janamejaya replied, 'Exert ye to the best of your might, so that this<br>sacrifice of mine may attain completion, and Takshaka also may soon come<br>here. He is my enemy.'<br><br>"The Ritwiks replied, 'As the scriptures declare unto us, and as the fire<br>also saith, O monarch, (it seems that) Takshaka is now staying in the<br>abode of Indra, afflicted with fear.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'The illustrious Suta named Lohitaksha also, conversant<br>with the Puranas, had said so before.<br><br>"Asked by the king on the present occasion he again told the monarch,<br>'Sire, it is even so as the Brahmanas have said&#8212;Knowing the Puranas, I<br>say, O monarch, that Indra hath granted him this boon, saying, 'Dwell<br>with me in concealment, and Agni shall not burn thee.'<br><br>'Sauti continued, 'Hearing this, the king installed in the sacrifice<br>became very sorry and urged the Hotri to do his duty. And as the Hotri,<br>with mantras, began to pour clarified butter into the fire Indra himself<br>appeared on the scene. And the illustrious one came in his car, adorned<br>by all the gods standing around, followed by masses of clouds, celestial<br>singers, and the several bevies of celestial dancing girls. And Takshaka<br>anxious with fear, hid himself in the upper garment of Indra and was not<br>visible. Then the king in his anger again said unto his mantra-knowing<br>Brahmanas these words, bent upon the destruction of Takshaka, 'If the<br>snake Takshaka be in the abode of Indra, cast him into the fire with<br>Indra himself.'<br><br>'Sauti continued, 'Urged thus by the king Janamejaya about Takshaka, the<br>Hotri poured libations, naming that snake then staying there. And even as<br>the libations were poured, Takshaka, with Purandara himself, anxious and<br>afflicted, became visible in a moment in the skies. Then Purandara,<br>seeing that sacrifice, became much alarmed, and quickly casting Takshaka<br>off, went back to his own abode. After Indra had gone away, Takshaka, the<br>prince of snakes, insensible with fear, was by virtue of the mantras,<br>brought near enough the flames of the sacrificial fire.'<br><br>"The Ritwiks then said, 'O king of kings, the sacrifice of thine is being<br>performed duly. It behoveth thee, O Lord, to grant a boon now to this<br>first of Brahmanas.'<br><br>"Janamejaya then said, 'Thou immeasurable one of such handsome and<br>child-like features, I desire to grant thee a worthy boon. Therefore, ask<br>thou that which thou desirest in thy heart. I promise thee, that I will<br>grant it even if it be ungrantable.'<br><br>'The Ritwiks said, 'O monarch, behold, Takshaka is soon coming under thy<br>control! His terrible cries, and loud roar is being heard. Assuredly, the<br>snake hath been forsaken by the wielder of thunder. His body being<br>disabled by your mantras, he is falling from heaven. Even now, rolling in<br>the skies, and deprived of consciousness, the prince of snakes cometh,<br>breathing loudly.'<br><br>'Sauti continued, 'While Takshaka, the prince of snakes was about to fall<br>into the sacrificial fire, during those few moments Astika spoke as<br>follows, 'O Janamejaya, if thou wouldst grant me a boon, let this<br>sacrifice of thine come to an end and let no more snakes fall into the<br>fire.'<br><br>'O Brahmana, the son of Parikshit, being thus addressed by Astika, became<br>exceedingly sorry and replied unto Astika thus, 'O illustrious one, gold,<br>silver, kine, whatever other possessions thou desirest I shall give unto<br>thee. But let not my sacrifice come to an end.'<br><br>"Astika thereupon replied, 'Gold, silver or kine, I do not ask of thee, O<br>monarch! But let thy sacrifice be ended so that my maternal relations be<br>relieved.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'The son of Parikshit, being thus addressed by Astika,<br>repeatedly said this unto that foremost of speakers, 'Best of the<br>Brahmanas, ask some other boon. O, blessed be thou!' But, O thou of<br>Bhrigu's race, he did not beg any other boon. Then all the Sadasyas<br>conversant with the Vedas told the king in one voice, 'Let the Brahmana<br>receive his boon!'"
