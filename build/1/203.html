                            (Viduragamana Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Dhritarashtra replied saying, I desire to do exactly<br>what you would recommend. But I do not wish to inform Vidura of it even<br>by a change of muscle. It was, therefore, O son, that I was applauding<br>the Pandavas in Vidura's presence, so that he might not know even by a<br>sign what is in my mind. Now that Vidura hath gone away, this is the<br>time, O Suyodhana (Duryodhana), for telling me what thou hast hit upon,<br>and what, O Radheya (Karna), thou too hast hit upon.'<br><br>"Duryodhana said. 'Let us, O father, by means of trusted and skilful and<br>adroit Brahmanas, seek to produce dissensions between the sons of Kunti<br>and Madri. Or, let king Drupada and his sons, and all his ministers of<br>state, be plied with presents of large wealth, so that they may abandon<br>the cause of Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti. Or, let our spies induce the<br>Pandavas to settle in Drupada's dominions, by describing to them,<br>separately, the inconvenience of residing in Hastinapura, so that,<br>separated from as, they may permanently settle in Panchala. Or, let some<br>clever spies, full of resources, sowing the seeds of dissension among the<br>Pandavas, make them jealous of one another. Or, let them incite Krishna<br>against her husbands. She has many lords and this will not present any<br>difficulty. Or, let some seek to make the Pandavas themselves<br>dissatisfied with Krishna, in which case Krishna also will be<br>dissatisfied with them. Or, let, O king, some clever spies, repairing<br>thither, secretly compass the death of Bhimasena. Bhima is the strongest<br>of them all. Relying upon Bhima alone, the Pandavas used to disregard us,<br>of old. Bhima is fierce and brave and the (sole) refuge of the Pandavas.<br>If he be slain, the others will be deprived of strength and energy.<br>Deprived of Bhima who is their sole refuge, they will no longer strive to<br>regain their kingdom. Arjuna, O king, is invincible in battle, if Bhima<br>protecteth him from behind. Without Bhima, Arjuna is not equal to even a<br>fourth part of Radheya. Indeed, O king, the Pandavas conscious of their<br>own feebleness without Bhima and of our strength would not really strive<br>to recover the kingdom. Or, if, O monarch, coming hither, they prove<br>docile and obedient to us, we would then seek to repress them according<br>to the dictates of political science (as explained by Kanika). Or, we may<br>tempt them by means of handsome girls, upon which the princess of<br>Panchala will get annoyed with them. Or, O Radheya, let messengers be<br>despatched to bring them hither, so that, when arrived, we may through<br>trusted agents, by some of the above methods, cause them to be slain.<br>Strive, O father, to employ any of these (various) methods that may<br>appear to thee faultless. Time passeth. Before their confidence in king<br>Drupada&#8212;that bull amongst kings&#8212;is established we may succeed, O<br>monarch, to encounter them. But after their confidence hath been<br>established in Drupada, we are sure to fail. These, O father, are my<br>views for the discomfiture of the Pandavas. Judge whether they be good or<br>bad. What, O Karna, dost thou think?'"
