                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'And Sringin then replied to his father, saying, 'Whether<br>this be an act of rashness, O father, or an improper act that I have<br>done, whether thou likest it or dislikest it, the words spoken by me<br>shall never be in vain. O father, I tell thee (a curse) can never be<br>otherwise. I have never spoken a lie even in jest.'<br><br>"And Samika said, 'Dear child, I know that thou art of great prowess, and<br>truthful in speech. Thou hast never spoken falsehood before, so that thy<br>curse shall never be falsified. The son, even when he attaineth to age,<br>should yet be always counselled by the father, so that crowned with good<br>qualities he may acquire great renown. A child as thou art, how much more<br>dost thou stand in need of counsel? Thou art ever engaged in ascetic<br>penances. The wrath of even the illustrious ones possessing the six<br>attributes increaseth greatly. O thou foremost of ordinance-observing<br>persons, seeing that thou art my son and a minor too, and beholding also<br>thy rashness, I see that I must counsel thee. Live thou, O son, inclined<br>to peace and eating fruits and roots of the forest. Kill this thy anger<br>and destroy not the fruit of thy ascetic acts in this way. Wrath surely<br>decreaseth the virtue that ascetics acquire with great pains. And then<br>for those deprived of virtue, the blessed state existeth not.<br>Peacefulness ever giveth success to forgiving ascetics. Therefore,<br>becoming forgiving in thy temper and conquering thy passions, shouldst<br>thou always live. By forgiveness shalt thou obtain worlds that are beyond<br>the reach of Brahman himself. Having adopted peacefulness myself, and<br>with a desire also for doing good as much as lies in my power, I must do<br>something; even must I send to that king, telling him, 'O monarch, thou<br>hast been cursed by my son of tender years and undeveloped intellect, in<br>wrath, at seeing thy act of disrespect towards myself.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'And that great ascetic, observer of vows, moved by<br>kindness, sent with proper instructions a disciple of his to king<br>Parikshit. And he sent his disciple Gaurmukha of good manners and engaged<br>also in ascetic penances, instructing him to first enquire about the<br>welfare of the king and then to communicate the real message. And that<br>disciple soon approached that monarch, the head of the Kuru race. And he<br>entered the king's palace having first sent notice of his arrival through<br>the servant in attendance at the gate.<br><br>"And the twice-born Gaurmukha was duly worshipped by the monarch. And<br>after resting for a while, he detailed fully to the king, in the presence<br>of his ministers, the words of Samika, of cruel import, exactly as he had<br>been instructed.'<br><br>"And Gaurmukha said, 'O king of kings, there is a Rishi, Samika, by name,<br>of virtuous soul, his passions under control, peaceful, and given up to<br>hard ascetic devotions, living in thy dominions! By thee, O tiger among<br>men, was placed on the shoulders of that Rishi observing at present the<br>vow of silence, a dead snake, with the end of thy bow! He himself forgave<br>thee that act. But his son could not. And by the latter hast thou today<br>been cursed, O king of kings, without the knowledge of his father, to the<br>effect that within seven nights hence, shall (the snake) Takshaka cause<br>thy death. And Samika repeatedly asked his son to save thee, but there is<br>none to falsify his son's curse. And because he hath been unable to<br>pacify his son possessed by anger, therefore have I been sent to thee, O<br>king, for thy good!'<br><br>"And that king of the Kuru race, himself engaged in ascetic practices,<br>having heard these cruel words and recollecting his own sinful act,<br>became exceedingly sorry. And the king, learning that foremost of Rishis<br>in the forest had been observing the vow of silence, was doubly afflicted<br>with sorrow and seeing the kindness of the Rishi Samika, and considering<br>his own sinful act towards him, the king became very repentant. And the<br>king looking like a very god, did not grieve so much for hearing of his<br>death as for having done that act to the Rishi.'<br><br>"And then the king sent away Gaurmukha, saying, 'Let the worshipful one<br>(Samika) be gracious to me!' And when Gaurmukha had gone away, the king,<br>in great anxiety, without loss of time, consulted his ministers. And<br>having consulted them, the king, himself wise in counsels, caused a<br>mansion to be erected upon one solitary column. It was well-guarded day<br>and night. And for its protection were placed there physicians and<br>medicines, and Brahmanas skilled in mantras all around. And the monarch,<br>protected on all sides, discharged his kingly duties from that place<br>surrounded by his virtuous ministers. And no one could approach that best<br>of kings there. The air even could not go there, being prevented from<br>entering.<br><br>"And when the seventh day had arrived, that best of Brahmanas, the<br>learned Kasyapa was coming (towards the king's residence), desirous of<br>treating the king (after the snake-bite). He had heard all that had taken<br>place, viz., that Takshaka, that first of snakes, would send that best of<br>monarchs to the presence of Yama (Death). And he thought, I would cure<br>the monarch after he is bit by that first of snakes. By that I may have<br>wealth and may acquire virtue also.' But that prince of snakes, Takshaka,<br>in the form of an old Brahmana, saw Kasyapa approaching on his way, his<br>heart set upon curing the king. And the prince of snakes then spake unto<br>that bull among Munis, Kasyapa, saying, 'Whither dost thou go with such<br>speed? What, besides, is the business upon which thou art intent?'<br><br>"And Kasyapa, thus addressed, replied, 'Takshaka, by his poison, will<br>today burn king Parikshit of the Kuru race, that oppressor of all<br>enemies. I go with speed, O amiable one, to cure, without loss of time,<br>the king of immeasurable prowess, the sole representative of the Pandava<br>race, after he is bit by the same Takshaka like to Agni himself in<br>energy.' And Takshaka answered, 'I am that Takshaka, O Brahmana, who<br>shall burn that lord of the earth. Stop, for thou art unable to cure one<br>bit by me.' And Kasyapa rejoined, 'I am sure that, possessed (that I am)<br>of the power of learning, going thither I shall cure that monarch bit by<br>thee.'"
