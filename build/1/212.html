                            (Rajya-labha Parva continued)<br><br>'Narada continued, 'As soon as those festivities came to an end, the<br>brothers Sunda and Upasunda, desirous of the Sovereignty of the three<br>worlds, took counsel and commanded their forces to be arranged. Obtaining<br>the assent of their friends and relatives, of the elders of the Daitya<br>race and of their ministers of state, and performing the preliminary<br>rites of departure, they set out in the night when the constellation<br>Magha was in the ascendant. The brothers set out with a large Daitya<br>force clad in mail and armed with maces and axes and lances and clubs.<br>The Daitya heroes set out on their expedition with joyous hearts, the<br>charanas (bards) chanting auspicious panegyrics indicative of their<br>future triumphs. Furious in war, the Daitya brothers, capable of going<br>everywhere at will, ascended the skies and went to the region of the<br>celestials. The celestials knowing they were coming and acquainted also<br>with the boons granted unto them by the Supreme Deity left heaven and<br>sought refuge in the region of Brahman. Endued with fierce prowess, the<br>Daitya heroes soon subjugated the region of Indra, and vanquishing the<br>diverse tribes of Yakshas and Rakshasas and every creature ranging the<br>skies, came away. Those mighty car-warriors next subjugated the Nagas of<br>the nether region, and then the inmates of the ocean and then all the<br>tribes of the Mlechchhas. Desirous next of subjugating the whole earth,<br>those heroes of irresistible sway, summoning their soldiers, issued these<br>cruel commands, 'Brahmanas and royal sages (on earth) with their<br>libations and other food offered at grand sacrifices, increase the energy<br>and strength of the gods, as also their prosperity. Engaged in such acts,<br>they are the enemies of the Asuras. All of us, therefore, mustering<br>together should completely slaughter them off the face of the earth!'<br>Ordering their soldiers thus on the eastern shore of the great ocean, and<br>entertaining such a cruel resolution, the Asura brothers set out in all<br>directions. And those that were performing sacrifices and the Brahmanas<br>that were assisting at those sacrifices, the mighty brothers instantly<br>slew. And slaughtering them with violence they departed for some other<br>place. Whilst their soldiers threw into the water the sacrificial fires<br>that were in the asylums of Munis with souls under complete control, the<br>curses uttered by the illustrious Rishis in wrath, rendered abortive by<br>the boons granted (by Brahman), affected not the Asura brothers. When the<br>Brahmanas saw that their curses produced not the slightest effect like<br>shafts shot at stones they fled in all directions, forsaking their rites<br>and vows. Even those Rishis on earth that were crowned with ascetic<br>success, and had their passions under complete control and were wholly<br>engrossed in meditation of the Deity, from fear of the Asura brothers,<br>fled like snakes at the approach of Vinata's son (Garuda the<br>snake-eater). The sacred asylums were all trodden down and broken. The<br>sacrificial jars and vessels being broken, their (sacred) contents were<br>scattered over the ground. The whole universe became empty, as if its<br>creatures had all been stricken down during the season of general<br>dissolution. And, O king, after the Rishis had all disappeared and made<br>themselves invisible both the great Asuras, resolved upon their<br>destruction, began to assume various forms. Assuming the forms of<br>maddened elephants with temples rent from excess of juice, the Asura<br>pair, searching out the Rishis who had sheltered themselves in caves,<br>sent them to the region of Yama. Sometimes becoming as lions and again as<br>tigers and disappearing the next moment, by these and other methods the<br>cruel couple, seeing the Rishis, slew them instantly. Sacrifice and study<br>ceased, and kings and Brahmanas were exterminated. The earth became<br>utterly destitute of sacrifices and festivals. And the terrified people<br>uttered cries of Oh and Alas and all buying and selling were stopped. All<br>religious rites ceased, and the earth became destitute of sacred<br>ceremonies and marriages. Agriculture was neglected and cattle were no<br>longer tended. Towns and asylums became desolate. And scattered over with<br>bones and skeletons, the earth assumed a frightful aspect. All ceremonies<br>in honour of the Pitris were suspended, and the sacred sound of Vashat<br>and the whole circle of auspicious rites ceased. The earth became<br>frightful to behold. The Sun and the Moon, the Planets and Stars, and<br>Constellations, and the other dwellers in the firmament, witnessing these<br>acts of Sunda and Upasunda, grieved deeply. Subjugating all the points of<br>heaven by means of such cruel acts, the Asura brothers took up their<br>abode in Kurukshetra, without a single rival.'"
