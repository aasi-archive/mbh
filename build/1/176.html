                            (Chaitraratha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'That bull among the Bharatas, Arjuna, hearing these<br>words of the Gandharva, was inspired with feelings of devotion and stood<br>shes (???&#8212;JBH), killing deer and wild boars. Once on a time, while out<br>in quest of deer, the king became weak with exertion and thirst. The<br>monarch arrived in that state at the asylum of Vasishtha, and the blessed<br>and illustrious Rishi beholding him arrive, reverenced with his homage<br>that best of men, king Viswamitra. And O Bharata, the Rishi saluted the<br>monarch by offering him water to wash his face and feet with, and Arghya,<br>and wild fruits, and clarified butter. For the illustrious Rishi had a<br>cow yielding anything that was desired of her. When she was addressed,<br>saying, 'O give',&#8212;she always yielded the article that was sought. And<br>she yielded various fruits and corn, wild or grown in gardens and fields,<br>and milk, and many excellent nutritive viands full of six different kinds<br>of juice (taste?) and like unto nectar itself, and various other kinds of<br>enjoyable things, O Arjuna, of ambrosial taste for drinking and eating,<br>and for licking and sucking, and also many precious gems and robes of<br>various kinds. With these desirable objects in profusion the monarch was<br>worshipped. And the king with his minister and troops became highly<br>pleased. And the monarch wondered much, beholding that cow with six<br>elevated limbs and the beautiful flanks and hips, and five limbs that<br>were broad, and eyes prominent like those of the frog and beautiful in<br>size, and high udders, and faultless make, and straight and uplifted<br>ears, and handsome horns, and well-developed head and neck.<br><br>"And, O prince, the son of Gadhi, gratified with everything and<br>applauding the cow named Nandini, addressed the Rishi, saying, 'O<br>Brahmana, O great Muni, give me thy Naridini in exchange for ten thousand<br>kine, or my kingdom. Enjoy thou my kingdom (giving me thy cow).'<br><br>"Hearing these words of Viswamitra, Vasishtha said, 'O sinless one, this<br>cow hath been kept by me for the sake of the gods, guests, and the<br>Pitris, as also for my sacrifices. I cannot give Nandini in exchange for<br>even thy kingdom.' Viswamitra replied, 'I am a Kshatriya, but thou art a<br>Brahmana devoted to asceticism and study. Is there any energy in<br>Brahmanas who are peaceful and who have their souls under perfect<br>command? When thou givest me not what I desire in exchange even for ten<br>thousand cows, I will not abandon the practice of my order; I will take<br>thy cow even by force!'<br><br>"Vasishtha said, 'Thou art a Kshatriya endued with might of arms. Thou<br>art a powerful monarch. O, do in haste what thou desirest; and stop not<br>to consider its propriety.'<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'Thus addressed by Vasishtha, Viswamitra, O<br>Partha, then forcibly seized Nandini, that cow (white) like the swan or<br>the moon, and attempted to take her away, afflicting her with stripes and<br>persecuting her otherwise. The innocent Nandini then began, O Partha, to<br>low piteously, and approaching the illustrious Vasishtha stood before him<br>with uplifted face. Though persecuted very cruelly, she refused to leave<br>the Rishi's asylum.'<br><br>"Beholding her in that plight, Vasishtha said, 'O amiable one, thou art<br>lowing repeatedly and I am hearing thy cries. But, O Nandini, even<br>Viswamitra is taking thee away by force, what can I do in this matter, as<br>I am a forgiving Brahmana?'<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'Then, O bull in Bharata's race, Nandini,<br>alarmed at the sight of Viswamitra's troops and terrified by Viswamitra<br>himself, approached the Rishi still closer, and said, 'O illustrious one,<br>why art thou so indifferent to my poor self afflicted with the stripes of<br>the cruel troops of Viswamitra and crying so piteously as if I were<br>masterless?' Hearing these words of the crying and persecuted Nandini,<br>the great Rishi lost not his patience nor turned from his vow of<br>forgiveness. He replied, 'The Kshatriya's might lies in physical<br>strength, the Brahmana's in forgiveness. Because I cannot give up<br>forgiveness, go thou, O Nandini, if thou choosest.' Nandini answered,<br>'Castest thou me away, O illustrious one, that thou sayest so? If thou<br>dost not cast me off, I cannot, O Brahmana, be taken away by force.'<br>Vasishtha said, 'O blessed one, I do not cast thee off! Stay if thou<br>canst! O, yonder is thy calf, tied with a stout cord, and even now being<br>weakened by it!'<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'Then the cow of Vasishtha, hearing the word<br>stay, raised her head and neck upward, and became terrible to behold.<br>With eyes red with rage and lowing repeatedly, she then attacked<br>Viswamitra's troops on all sides. Afflicted with their stripes and<br>running hither and thither with those red eyes of hers, her wrath<br>increased. Blazing with rage, she soon became terrible to behold like<br>unto the sun in his midday glory. And from her tail she began to rain<br>showers of burning coals all around. And some moments after, from her<br>tail she brought forth an army of Palhavas, and from her udders, an army<br>of Dravidas and Sakas; and from her womb, an army of Yavanas, and from<br>her dung, an army of Savaras; and from her urine, an army of Kanchis; and<br>from her sides, an army of Savaras. And from the froth of her mouth came<br>out hosts of Paundras and Kiratas, Yavanas and Sinhalas, and the<br>barbarous tribes of Khasas and Chivukas and Pulindas and Chinas and Hunas<br>with Keralas, and numerous other Mlechchhas. And that vast army of<br>Mlechchhas in various uniforms, and armed with various weapons, as soon<br>as it sprang into life, deploying in the very sight of Viswamitra,<br>attacked that monarch's soldiers. And so numerous was that Mlechchha host<br>that each particular soldier of Viswamitra was attacked by a band of six<br>or seven of their enemies. Assailed with a mighty shower of weapons,<br>Viswamitra's troops broke and fled, panic-stricken, in all directions,<br>before his very eyes. But, O bull in Bharata's race, the troops of<br>Vasishtha, though excited with wrath, took not the life of any of<br>Viswamitra's troops. Nandini simply caused the monarch's army to be<br>routed and driven off. And driven (from the asylum) twenty-seven full<br>miles, panic-stricken, they shrieked aloud and beheld not anyone that<br>could protect them. Viswamitra, beholding this wonderful feat that<br>resulted from Brahmana prowess, became disgusted with Kshatriya prowess<br>and said, 'O, fie on Kshatriya prowess! Brahmana prowess is true prowess!<br>In judging of strength and weakness, I see that asceticism is true<br>strength.' Saying this, the monarch, abandoning his large domains and<br>regal splendour and turning his back upon all pleasures, set his mind on<br>asceticism. Crowned with success in asceticism and filling the three<br>worlds with the heat of his ascetic penances, he afflicted all creatures<br>and finally became a Brahmana. The son of Kusika at last drank Soma with<br>Indra himself (in Heaven).'"
