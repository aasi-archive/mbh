                            (Subhadra-harana Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then Dhananjaya, informed of the assent of<br>Yudhishthira, and ascertaining, O Janamejaya, that the maiden had gone to<br>the Raivataka hill, obtained the assent of Vasudeva also, after having<br>settled in consultation with him all that required to be done. Then that<br>bull of Bharata's race, that foremost of men, with Krishna's assent,<br>riding in his well-built car of gold equipped with rows of small bells<br>and with every kind of weapon and the clatter of whose wheels resembled<br>the roar of the clouds and whose splendour was like unto that of a<br>blazing fire and which struck terror into the hearts of all foes and unto<br>which were yoked the steeds Saivya and Sugriva, himself accoutred in mail<br>and armed with sword and his fingers encased in leathern gloves, set out,<br>as it were, on a hunting expedition. Meanwhile Subhadra, having paid her<br>homage unto that prince of hills, Raivataka and having worshipped the<br>deities and made the Brahmanas utter benedictions upon her, and having<br>also walked round the hill, was coming towards Dwaravati. The son of<br>Kunti, afflicted with the shafts of the god of desire, suddenly rushed<br>towards that Yadava girl of faultless features and forcibly took her into<br>his car. Having seized that girl of sweet smiles, that tiger among men<br>proceeded in his car of gold towards his own city (Indraprastha).<br>Meanwhile, the armed attendants of Subhadra, beholding her thus seized<br>and taken away, all ran, crying towards the city of Dwaraka. Reaching all<br>together the Yadava court called by the name of Sudharma, they<br>represented everything about the prowess of Partha unto the chief officer<br>of the court. The chief officer of the court, having heard everything<br>from those messengers, blew his gold-decked trumpet of loud blare,<br>calling all to arms. Stirred up by that sound, the Bhojas, the Vrishnis,<br>and the Andhakas began to pour in from all sides. Those that were eating<br>left their food, and those that were drinking left their drink. Those<br>tigers among men, those great warriors of the Vrishni and the Andhaka<br>tribes, took their seats upon their thousand thrones of gold covered with<br>excellent carpets and variegated with gems and corals and possessed of<br>the lustre of blazing fire. Indeed they took their seats upon those<br>thrones, like blazing fires receiving faggots to increase their<br>splendour. And after they were seated in that court which was like unto a<br>conclave of the celestials themselves, the chief officer of the court,<br>assisted by those that stood at his back, spoke of the conduct of Jishnu.<br>The proud Vrishni heroes, of eyes red with wine, as soon as they heard of<br>it, rose up from their seats, unable to brook what Arjuna had done. Some<br>amongst them said, 'Yoke our cars', and some, 'Bring our weapons' and<br>some said, 'Bring our costly bows and strong coats of mail; and some<br>loudly called upon their charioteers to harness their cars, and some,<br>from impatience, themselves yoked their horses decked with gold unto<br>their cars. And while their cars and armours and standards were being<br>brought, loud became the uproar of those heroes. Then Valadeva, white and<br>tall as the peak of Kailasa, decked with garlands of wild flowers and<br>attired in blue robes, and proud and intoxicated with drink, said these<br>words:<br><br>'Ye senseless men, what are ye doing, when Janardana sitteth silent?<br>Without knowing what is in his mind, vainly do we roar in wrath! Let the<br>high-souled Krishna give out what he proposeth. Accomplish promptly what<br>he desireth to do.' Then all of them, hearing those words of Halayudha<br>that deserved to be accepted, exclaimed, 'Excellent! Excellent!' They<br>then all became silent. Silence having been restored by the words of the<br>intelligent Valadeva, they took their seats once more in that assembly.<br>Then Rama, that oppressor of foes, spoke unto Vasudeva, saying, 'Why, O<br>Janardana, sittest thou, gazing silently? O Achyuta, it was for thy sake<br>that the son of Pritha had been welcomed and honoured by us. It seemeth,<br>however, that that vile wretch deserved not our homage. What man is there<br>born of a respectable family that would break the plate after having<br>dined from it! Even if one desireth to make such an alliance, yet<br>remembering all the services he hath received, who is there, desirous of<br>happiness, that acts so rashly? That Pandava disregarding us and thee too<br>hath today outraged Subhadra, desiring (to compass) his own death. He<br>hath placed his foot on the crown of my head. How shall I, O Govinda,<br>tamely bear it? Shall I not resent it, even like a snake that is trodden<br>upon? Alone shall I today make the earth destitute of Kauravas! Never<br>shall I put up with this transgression by Arjuna.' Then all the Bhojas,<br>Vrishnis, and Andhakas, present there, approved of everything that<br>Valadeva had said, deeply roaring like unto a kettle-drum or the clouds.'"
