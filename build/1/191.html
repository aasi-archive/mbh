                            (Swayamvara Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'When the king (Drupada) expressed his desire of<br>bestowing his daughter on that Brahmana (who had shot the mark), all<br>those monarchs who had been invited to the Swayamvara, looking at one<br>another, were suddenly filled with wrath. And they said, 'Passing us by<br>and treating the assembled monarchs as straw this Drupada desireth to<br>bestow his daughter&#8212;that first of women,&#8212;on a Brahmana! Having planted<br>the tree he cutteth it down when it is about to bear fruit. The wretch<br>regardeth us not: therefore let us slay him. He deserveth not our respect<br>nor the veneration due to age. Owing to such qualities of his, we shall,<br>therefore, slay this wretch that insulteth all kings, along with his son.<br>Inviting all the monarchs and entertaining them with excellent food, he<br>disregardeth us at last. In this assemblage of monarchs like unto a<br>conclave of the celestials, doth he not see a single monarch equal unto<br>himself? The Vedic declaration is well-known that the Swayamvara is for<br>the Kshatriyas. The Brahmanas have no claim in respect of a selection of<br>husband by a Kshatriya damsel. Or, ye kings, if this damsel desireth not<br>to select any one of us as her lord, let us cast her into the fire and<br>return to our kingdoms. As regards this Brahmana, although he hath, from<br>officiousness or avarice, done this injury to the monarchs, he should not<br>yet be slain; for our kingdoms, lives, treasures, sons, grandsons, and<br>whatever other wealth we have, all exist for Brahmanas. Something must be<br>done here (even unto him), so that from fear of disgrace and the desire<br>of maintaining what properly belongeth unto each order, other Swayamvaras<br>may not terminate in this way.'<br><br>"Having addressed one another thus, those tigers among monarchs endued<br>with arms like unto spiked iron maces, took up their weapons and rushed<br>at Drupada to slay him then and there. And Drupada beholding those<br>monarchs all at once rushing towards him in anger with bows and arrows,<br>sought, from fear, the protection of the Brahmanas. But those mighty<br>bowmen (Bhima and Arjuna) of the Pandavas, capable of chastising all<br>foes, advanced to oppose those monarchs rushing towards them impetuously<br>like elephants in the season of rut. Then the monarchs with gloved<br>fingers and upraised weapons rushed in anger at the Kuru princes, Bhima<br>and Arjuna, to slay them. Then the mighty Bhima of extraordinary<br>achievements, endued with the strength of thunder, tore up like an<br>elephant a large tree and divested it of its leaves. And with that tree,<br>the strong-armed Bhima, the son of Pritha, that grinder of foes, stood,<br>like unto the mace-bearing king of the dead (Yama) armed with his fierce<br>mace, near Arjuna that bull amongst men. And beholding that feat of his<br>brother, Jishnu of extraordinary intelligence, himself also of<br>inconceivable feats, wondered much. And equal unto Indra himself in<br>achievements, shaking off all fear he stood with his bow ready to receive<br>those assailants. And beholding those feats of both Jishnu and his<br>brother, Damodara (Krishna) of superhuman intelligence and inconceivable<br>feats, addressing his brother, Halayudha (Valadeva) of fierce energy,<br>said, 'That hero there, of tread like that of a mighty lion, who draweth<br>the large bow in his hand four full cubits in length, is Arjuna! There is<br>no doubt, O Sankarshana, about this, if I am Vasudeva. That other hero<br>who having speedily torn up the tree hath suddenly become ready to drive<br>off the monarchs is Vrikodara! For no one in the world, except Vrikodara,<br>could today perform such a feat in the field of battle. And that other<br>youth of eyes like unto lotus-petals, of full four cubits height, of gait<br>like that of a mighty lion, and humble withal, of fair complexion and<br>prominent and shining nose, who had, a little before, left the<br>amphitheatre, is Dharma's son (Yudhishthira). The two other youths, like<br>unto Kartikeya, are, I suspect, the sons of the twin Aswins. I heard that<br>the sons of Pandu along with their mother Pritha had all escaped from the<br>conflagration of the house of lac.' Then Halayudha of complexion like<br>unto that of clouds uncharged with rain, addressing his younger brother<br>(Krishna), said with great satisfaction, 'O, I am happy to hear, as I do<br>from sheer good fortune, that our father's sister Pritha with the<br>foremost of the Kaurava princes have all escaped (from death)!'"
