                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'A certain Brahmana with his wife had entered the<br>throat of that ranger of the skies. The former began to burn the bird's<br>throat like a piece of flaming charcoal. Him Garuda addressed, saying, 'O<br>best of Brahmanas, come out soon from my mouth which I open for thee. A<br>Brahmana must never be slain by me, although he may be always engaged in<br>sinful practices.' Unto Garuda who had thus addressed him that Brahmana<br>said, 'O, let this woman of the Nishada caste, who is my wife, also come<br>out with me.' And Garuda said, 'Taking the woman also of the Nishada<br>caste with thee, come out soon. Save thyself without delay since thou<br>hast not yet been digested by the heat of my stomach.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'And then that Brahmana, accompanied by his wife of the<br>Nishada caste, came out, and praising Garuda wended whatever way he<br>liked. And when that Brahmana had come out with his wife, that lord of<br>birds, fleet as the mind, stretching his wings ascended the skies. He<br>then saw his father, and, hailed by him, Garuda, of incomparable prowess<br>made proper answers. And the great Rishi (Kasyapa) then asked him, 'O<br>child, is it well with thee? Dost thou get sufficient food every day? Is<br>there food in plenty for thee in the world of men?'<br><br>"Garuda replied, 'My mother is ever well. And so is my brother, and so am<br>I. But, father, I do not always obtain plenty of food, for which my peace<br>is incomplete. I am sent by the snakes to fetch the excellent amrita.<br>Indeed, I shall fetch it today for emancipating my mother from her<br>bondage. My mother command me, saying, 'Eat thou the Nishadas.' I have<br>eaten them by thousands, but my hunger is not appeased. Therefore, O<br>worshipful one, point out to me some other food, by eating which, O<br>master, I may be strong enough to bring away amrita by force. Thou<br>shouldst indicate some food wherewith I may appease my hunger and thirst.'<br><br>"Kasyapa replied, 'This lake thou seest is sacred. It hath been heard, of<br>even in the heavens. There is an elephant, with face downwards, who<br>continually draggeth a tortoise, his elder brother. I shall speak to you<br>in detail of their hostility in former life. Just listen as I tell you<br>why they are here.<br><br>"There was of old a great Rishi of the name of Vibhavasu. He was<br>exceedingly wrathful. He had a younger brother of the name of Supritika.<br>The latter was averse to keeping his wealth jointly with his brother's.<br>And Supritika would always speak of partition. After some time his<br>brother Vibhavasu told Supritika, 'It is from great foolishness that<br>persons blinded by love of wealth always desire to make a partition of<br>their patrimony. After effecting a partition they fight with each other,<br>deluded by wealth. Then again, enemies in the guise of friends cause<br>estrangements between ignorant and selfish men alter they become<br>separated in wealth, and pointing out faults confirm their quarrels, so<br>that the latter soon fall one by one. Absolute ruin very soon overtakes<br>the separated. For these reasons the wise never speak approvingly of<br>partition amongst brothers who, when divided, do not regard the most<br>authoritative Sastras and live always in fear of each other. But as thou,<br>Supritika, without regarding my advice impelled by desire of separation,<br>always wishest to make an arrangement about your property, thou shall<br>become an elephant.' Supritika, thus cursed, then spake unto Vibhavasu,<br>'Thou also shall become a tortoise moving in the midst of the waters.'<br><br>"And thus on account of wealth those two fools, Supritika and Vibhavasu,<br>from each other's curse, have become an elephant and a tortoise<br>respectively. Owing to their wrath, they have both become inferior<br>animals. And they are engaged in hostilities with each other, proud of<br>their excessive strength and the weight of their bodies. And in this lake<br>those two beings of huge bodies are engaged in acts according to their<br>former hostility. Look here, one amongst them, the handsome elephant of<br>huge body, is even now approaching. Hearing his roar, the tortoise also<br>of huge body, living within the waters, cometh out, agitating the lake<br>violently. And seeing him the elephant, curling his trunk, rusheth into<br>the water. And endued with great energy, with motion of his tusks and<br>fore-part of his trunk and tail and feet, he agitates the water of the<br>lake abounding with fishes. And the tortoise also of great strength, with<br>upraised head, cometh forward for an encounter. And the elephant is six<br>yojanas in height and twice that measure in circumference. And the height<br>of the tortoise also is three yojanas and his circumference ten. Eat thou<br>up both of them that are madly engaged in the encounter and bent upon<br>slaying each other, and then accomplish the task that thou desirest.<br>Eating that fierce elephant which looketh like a huge mountain and<br>resembleth a mass of dark clouds, bring thou amrita.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Having said so unto Garuda, he (Kasyapa) blessed him,<br>saying, 'Blest be thou when thou art in combat with the gods. Let water<br>pitchers filled to the brim, Brahmanas, kine, and other auspicious<br>objects, bless thee, thou oviparous one. And, O thou of great strength,<br>when thou art engaged with the gods in combat, let the Riks, the Yajus,<br>the Samas, the sacred sacrificial butter, all the mysteries (Upanishads),<br>constitute thy strength.'<br><br>"Garuda, thus addressed by his father, wended to the side of that lake.<br>He saw that expanse of clear water with birds of various kinds all<br>around. And remembering the words of his father, that ranger of the skies<br>possessed of great swiftness of motion, seized the elephant and the<br>tortoise, one in each claw. And that bird then soared high into the air.<br>And he came upon a sacred place called Alamva and saw many divine trees.<br>And struck by the wind raised by his wings, those trees began to shake<br>with fear. And those divine trees having golden boughs feared that they<br>would break. And the ranger of the skies seeing that those trees capable<br>of granting every wish were quaking with fear, went to other trees of<br>incomparable appearance. And those gigantic trees were adorned with<br>fruits of gold and silver and branches of precious gems. And they were<br>washed with the water of the sea. And there was a large banian among<br>them, which had grown into gigantic proportions, that spoke unto that<br>lord of bird coursing towards it with the fleetness of the mind, 'Sit<br>thou on this large branch of mine extending a hundred yojanas and eat the<br>elephant and the tortoise.' When that best of birds, of great swiftness<br>and of body resembling a mountain, quickly alighted upon a bough of that<br>banian tree, the resort of thousands of winged creatures-that bough also<br>full of leaves shook and broke down.'"<br><br>So ends the twenty-ninth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.
