                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'When the spectators, with eyes expanded with<br>wonder, made way for that subjugator of hostile cities, Karna, that hero<br>with his natural mail and face brightened with ear-rings, took up his bow<br>and girded on his sword, and then entered the spacious lists, like a<br>walking cliff. That far-famed destroyer of hostile hosts, the large-eyed<br>Karna, was born of Pritha in her maidenhood. He was a portion of the<br>hot-beamed Sun and his energy and prowess were like unto those of the<br>lion, or the bull, or the leader of a herd of elephants. In splendour he<br>resembled the Sun, in loveliness the Moon, and in energy the fire.<br>Begotten by the Sun himself, he was tall in stature like a golden palm<br>tree, and, endued with the vigour of youth, he was capable of slaying a<br>lion. Handsome in features, he was possessed of countless<br>accomplishments. The mighty-armed warrior, eyeing all around the arena,<br>bowed indifferently to Drona and Kripa. And the entire assembly,<br>motionless and with steadfast gaze, thought, 'Who is he?' And they became<br>agitated in their curiosity to know the warrior. And that foremost of<br>eloquent men, the offspring of the Sun, in a voice deep as that of the<br>clouds, addressed his unknown brother, the son of the subduer of the<br>Asura, Paka (Indra), saying, 'O Partha, I shall perform feats before this<br>gazing multitude; excelling all thou hast performed! Beholding them, thou<br>shall be amazed.' And, O thou best of those blest with speech, he had<br>hardly done when the spectators stood up all at once, uplifted by some<br>instrument, as it were. And, O tiger among men, Duryodhana was filled<br>with delight, while Vibhatsu was instantly all abashment and anger. Then<br>with the permission of Drona, the mighty Karna, delighting in battle,<br>there did all that Partha had done before. And, O Bharata, Duryodhana<br>with his brothers thereupon embraced Karna in joy and then addressed him<br>saying, 'Welcome O mighty-armed warrior! I have obtained thee by good<br>fortune, O polite one! Live thou as thou pleasest, and command me, and<br>the kingdom of the Kurus.' Kama replied, 'When thou hast said it, I<br>regard it as already accomplished. I only long for thy friendship. And, O<br>lord, my wish is even for a single combat with Arjuna.' Duryodhana said,<br>'Do thou with me enjoy the good things of life! Be thou the benefactor of<br>thy friend, and, O represser of enemies, place thou thy feet on the heads<br>of all foes."<br><br>"Vaisampayanacontinued, 'Arjuna, after this, deeming himself disgraced,<br>said unto Karna stationed amidst the brothers like unto a cliff, 'That<br>path which the unwelcome intruder and the uninvited talker cometh to,<br>shall be thine, O Karna, for thou shall be slain by me.' Karna replied,<br>'This arena is meant for all, not for thee alone, O Phalguna! They are<br>kings who are superior in energy; and verily the Kshatriya regardeth<br>might and might alone. What need of altercation which is the exercise of<br>the weak? O Bharata, speak then in arrows until with arrows I strike off<br>thy head today before the preceptor himself!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hastily embraced by his brothers, Partha that<br>subduer of hostile cities, with the permission of Drona, advanced for the<br>combat. On the other side, Karna, having been embraced by Duryodhana with<br>his brothers, taking up his bow and arrows, stood ready for the fight.<br>Then the firmament became enveloped in clouds emitting flashes of<br>lightning, and the coloured bow of Indra appeared shedding its effulgent<br>rays. And the clouds seemed to laugh on account of the rows of white<br>cranes that were then on the wing. And seeing Indra thus viewing the<br>arena from affection (for his son), the sun too dispersed the clouds from<br>over his own offspring. And Phalguna remained deep hid under cover of the<br>clouds, while Karna remained visible, being surrounded by the rays of the<br>Sun. And the son of Dhritarashtra stood by Karna, and Bharadwaja and<br>Kripa and Bhishma remained with Partha. And the assembly was divided, as<br>also the female spectators. And knowing the state of things, Kunti the<br>daughter of Bhoja, swooned away. And by the help of female attendants,<br>Vidura, versed in the lore of all duties, revived the insensible Kunti by<br>sprinkling sandal-paste and water on her person. On being restored to<br>consciousness, Kunti, seeing her two sons clad in mail, was seized with<br>fear, but she could do nothing (to protect them). And beholding both the<br>warriors with bows strung in their hands the son of Saradwat, viz.,<br>Kripa, knowing all duties and cognisant of the rules regulating duels,<br>addressed Karna, saying 'This Pandava, who is the youngest son of Kunti,<br>belongeth to the Kaurava race: he will engage in combat with thee. But, O<br>mighty-armed one, thou too must tell us thy lineage and the names of thy<br>father and mother and the royal line of which thou art the ornament.<br>Learning all this, Partha will fight with thee or not (as he will think<br>fit). Sons of kings never fight with men of inglorious lineage.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'When he was thus addressed by Kripa, Karna's<br>countenance became like unto a lotus pale and torn with the pelting<br>showers in the rainy season. Duryodhana said, 'O preceptor, verily the<br>scriptures have it that three classes of persons can lay claim to<br>royalty, viz., persons of the blood royal, heroes, and lastly, those that<br>lead armies. If Phalguna is unwilling to fight with one who is not a<br>king, I will install Karna as king of Anga.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'At that very moment, seated on a golden seat, with<br>parched paddy and with flowers and water-pots and much gold, the mighty<br>warrior Karna was installed king by Brahmanas versed in mantras. And the<br>royal umbrella was held over his head, while Yak-tails waved around that<br>redoubtable hero of graceful mien. And the cheers, having ceased, king<br>(Karna) said unto the Kaurava Duryodhana, 'O tiger among monarchs, what<br>shall I give unto thee that may compare with thy gift of a kingdom? O<br>king, I will do all thou biddest!' And Suyodhana said unto him, 'I<br>eagerly wish for thy friendship.' Thus spoken to, Karna replied, 'Be it<br>so.' And they embraced each other in joy, and experienced great<br>happiness.'"
