                            (Adivansavatarana Parva continued)<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'O excellent Brahmana, thou hast, indeed, told me, in<br>brief, the history, called Mahabharata, of the great acts of the Kurus.<br>But, O thou of ascetic wealth, recite now that wonderful narration fully.<br>I feel a great curiosity to hear it. It behoveth thee to recite it,<br>therefore, in full. I am not satisfied with hearing in a nutshell the<br>great history. That could never have been a trifling cause for which the<br>virtuous ones could slay those whom they should not have slain, and for<br>which they are yet applauded by men. Why also did those tigers among men,<br>innocent and capable of avenging themselves upon their enemies, calmly<br>suffer the persecution of the wicked Kurus? Why also, O best of<br>Brahmanas, did Bhima of mighty arms and of the strength of ten thousand<br>elephants, control his anger, though wronged? Why also did the chaste<br>Krishna, the daughter of Drupada, wronged by those wretches and able to<br>burn them, not burn the sons of Dhritarashtra with her wrathful eyes? Why<br>also did the two other sons of Pritha (Bhima and Arjuna) and the two sons<br>of Madri (Nakula and Sahadeva), themselves injured by the wretched Kurus,<br>follow Yudhishthira who was greatly addicted to the evil habit of<br>gambling? Why also did Yudhishthira, that foremost of all virtuous men,<br>the son of Dharma himself, fully acquainted with all duties, suffer that<br>excess of affliction? Why also did the Pandava Dhananjaya, having Krishna<br>for his charioteer, who by his arrows sent to the other world that<br>dauntless host of fighting men (suffer such persecution)? O thou of<br>ascetic wealth, speak to me of all these as they took place, and<br>everything that those mighty charioteers achieved.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'O monarch, appoint thou a time for hearing it. This<br>history told by Krishna-Dwaipayana is very extensive. This is but the<br>beginning. I shall recite it. I shall repeat the whole of the composition<br>in full, of the illustrious and great Rishi Vyasa of immeasurable mental<br>power, and worshipped in all the worlds. This Bharata consists of a<br>hundred thousand sacred slokas composed by the son of Satyavati, of<br>immeasurable mental power. He that reads it to others, and they that hear<br>it read, attain to the world of Brahman and become equal to the very<br>gods. This Bharata is equal unto the Vedas, is holy and excellent; is the<br>worthiest of all to be listened to, and is a Purana worshipped by the<br>Rishis. It contains much useful instruction on Artha and Kama (profit and<br>pleasure). This sacred history maketh the heart desire for salvation.<br>Learned persons by reciting this Veda of Krishna-Dwaipayana to those that<br>are liberal, truthful and believing, earn much wealth. Sins, such as<br>killing the embryo in the womb, are destroyed assuredly by this. A<br>person, however cruel and sinful, by hearing this history, escapes from<br>all his sins like the Sun from Rahu (after the eclipse is over). This<br>history is called Jaya. It should be heard by those desirous of victory.<br>A king by hearing it may bring the whole world under subjection and<br>conquer all his foes. This history in itself is a mighty act of<br>propitiation, a mighty sacrifice productive of blessed fruit. It should<br>always be heard by a young monarch with his queen, for then they beget a<br>heroic son or a daughter to occupy a throne. This history is the high and<br>sacred science of Dharma, Artha, and also of Moksha; it hath been so said<br>by Vyasa himself of mind that is immeasurable. This history is recited in<br>the present age and will be recited in the future. They that hear it,<br>read, have sons and servants always obedient to them and doing their<br>behests. All sins that are committed by body, word, or mind, immediately<br>leave them that hear this history. They who hear, without the spirit of<br>fault finding, the story of the birth of the Bharata princes, can have no<br>fear of maladies, let alone the fear of the other world.<br><br>"For extending the fame of the high-souled Pandavas and of other<br>Kshatriyas versed in all branches of knowledge, high spirited, and<br>already known in the world for their achievements, Krishna-Dwaipayana,<br>guided also by the desire of doing good to the world, hath composed this<br>work. It is excellent, productive of fame, grants length of life, is<br>sacred and heavenly. He who, from desire of acquiring religious merit,<br>causeth this history to be heard by sacred Brahmanas, acquireth great<br>merit and virtue that is inexhaustible. He that reciteth the famous<br>generation of the Kurus becometh immediately purified and acquireth a<br>large family himself, and becometh respected in the world. That Brahmana<br>who regularly studies this sacred Bharata for the four months of the<br>rainy season, is cleansed from all his sins. He that has read the Bharata<br>may be regarded as one acquainted with the Vedas.<br><br>"This work presents an account of the gods and royal sages and sacred<br>regenerate Rishis, the sinless Kesava; the god of gods, Mahadeva and the<br>goddess Parvati; the birth of Kartikeya who sprang from union of Parvati<br>with Mahadeva and was reared by many mothers; the greatness of Brahmanas<br>and of kine. This Bharata is a collection of all the Srutis, and is fit<br>to be heard by every virtuous person. That learned man who reciteth it to<br>Brahmanas during the sacred lunations, becometh cleansed of all sins,<br>and, not caring for heaven as it were, attaineth to a union with Brahma.<br>He that causeth even a single foot of this poem to be heard by Brahmanas<br>during the performance of a Sraddha, maketh that Sraddha inexhaustible,<br>the Pitris becoming ever gratified with the articles once presented to<br>them. The sins that are committed daily by our senses or the mind, those<br>that are committed knowingly or unknowingly by any man, are all destroyed<br>by hearing the Mahabharata. The history of the exalted birth of the<br>Bharata princes is called the Mahabharata. He who knoweth this etymology<br>of the name is cleansed of all his sins. And as this history of the<br>Bharata race is so wonderful, that, when recited, it assuredly purifieth<br>mortals from all sins. The sage Krishna-Dwaipayana completed his work in<br>three years. Rising daily and purifying himself and performing his<br>ascetic devotions, he composed this Mahabharata. Therefore, this should<br>be heard by Brahmanas with the formality of a vow. He who reciteth this<br>holy narration composed by Krishna (Vyasa) for the hearing of others, and<br>they who hear it, in whatever state he or they may be, can never be<br>affected by the fruit of deeds, good or bad. The man desirous of<br>acquiring virtue should hear it all. This is equivalent to all histories,<br>and he that heareth it always attaineth to purity of heart. The<br>gratification that one deriveth from attaining to heaven is scarcely<br>equal to that which one deriveth from hearing this holy history. The<br>virtuous man who with reverence heareth it or causeth it to be heard,<br>obtaineth the fruit of the Rajasuya and the horse-sacrifice. The Bharata<br>is said to be as much a mine of gems as the vast Ocean or the great<br>mountain Meru. This history is sacred and excellent, and is equivalent to<br>the Vedas, worthy of being heard, pleasing to the ear, sin-cleansing, and<br>virtue-increasing. O monarch, he that giveth a copy of the Bharata to one<br>that asketh for it doth indeed make a present of the whole earth with her<br>belt of seas. O son of Parikshit, this pleasant narration that giveth<br>virtue and victory I am about to recite in its entirety: listen to it.<br>The sage Krishna-Dwaipayana regularly rising for three years, composed<br>this wonderful history called Mahabharata. O bull amongst the Bharata<br>monarchs, whatever is spoken about virtue, wealth, pleasure, and<br>salvation may be seen elsewhere; but whatever is not contained in this is<br>not to be found anywhere.'"
