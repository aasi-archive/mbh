                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'O thou of Bharata's race, beholding the sons of<br>Dhritarashtra and Pandu accomplished in arms, Drona, O monarch, addressed<br>king Dhritarashtra, in the presence of Kripa, Somadatta, Valhika, the<br>wise son of Ganga (Bhishma), Vyasa, and Vidura, and said, 'O best of Kuru<br>kings, thy children have completed their education. With thy permission,<br>O king, let them now show their proficiency.' Hearing him, the king said<br>with a gladdened heart, 'O best of Brahmanas, thou hast, indeed,<br>accomplished a great deed. Command me thyself as to the place and the<br>time where and when and the manner also in which the trial may be held.<br>Grief arising from my own blindness maketh me envy those who, blessed<br>with sight, will behold my children's prowess in arm. O Kshatri (Vidura),<br>do all that Drona sayeth. O thou devoted to virtue, I think there is<br>nothing that can be more agreeable to me.' Then Vidura, giving the<br>necessary assurance to the king, went out to do what he was bid. And<br>Drona endued with great wisdom, then measured out a piece of land that<br>was void of trees and thickets and furnished with wells and springs. And<br>upon the spot of land so measured out, Drona, that first of eloquent men,<br>selecting a lunar day when the star ascendant was auspicious, offered up<br>sacrifice unto the gods in the presence of the citizens assembled by<br>proclamation to witness the same. And then, O bull among men, the<br>artificers of the king built thereon a large and elegant stage according<br>to the rules laid down in the scriptures, and it was furnished with all<br>kinds of weapons. They also built another elegant hall for the<br>lady-spectators. And the citizens constructed many platforms while the<br>wealthier of them pitched many spacious and high tents all around.<br><br>"When the day fixed for the Tournament came, the king accompanied by his<br>ministers, with Bhishma and Kripa, the foremost of preceptors, walking<br>ahead, came unto that theatre of almost celestial beauty constructed of<br>pure gold, and decked with strings of pearls and stones of lapis lazuli.<br>And, O first of victorious men, Gandhari blessed with great good fortune<br>and Kunti, and the other ladies of the royal house-hold, in gorgeous<br>attire and accompanied by their waiting women, joyfully ascended the<br>platforms, like celestial ladies ascending the Sumeru mountain. And the<br>four orders including the Brahmanas and Kshatriyas, desirous of beholding<br>the princes' skill in arms, left the city and came running to the spot.<br>And so impatient was every one to behold the spectacle, that the vast<br>crowd assembled there in almost an instant. And with the sounds of<br>trumpets and drums and the noise of many voices, that vast concourse<br>appeared like an agitated ocean.<br><br>"At last, Drona accompanied by his son, dressed in white (attire), with a<br>white sacred thread, white locks, white beard, white garlands, and white<br>sandal-paste rubbed over his body, entered the lists. It seemed as if the<br>Moon himself accompanied by the planet Mars appeared in an unclouded sky.<br>On entering Bharadwaja performed timely worship and caused Brahmanas<br>versed in mantras to celebrate the auspicious rites. And after auspicious<br>and sweet-sounding musical instruments had been struck up as a<br>propitiatory ceremony, some persons entered, equipped with various arms.<br>And then having girded up their loins, those mighty warriors, those<br>foremost ones of Bharata's race (the princes) entered, furnished with<br>finger-protectors (gauntlet), and bows, and quivers. And with<br>Yudhishthira at their head, the valiant princes entered in order of age<br>and began to show wonderful skill with their weapons. Some of the<br>spectators lowered their heads, apprehending fall of arrows while others<br>fearlessly gazed on with wonder. And riding swiftly on horses and<br>managing them 'dexterously' the princes began to hit marks with shafts<br>engraved with their respective names. And seeing the prowess of the<br>princes armed with bows and arrows, the spectators thought that they were<br>beholding the city of the Gandharvas, became filled with amazement. And,<br>O Bharata, all on a sudden, some hundreds and thousands, with eyes wide<br>open in wonder, exclaimed, 'Well done! Well done!' And having repeatedly<br>displayed their skill and dexterity in the use of bows and arrows and in<br>the management of cars, the mighty warriors took up their swords and<br>bucklers, and began to range the lists, playing their weapons. The<br>spectators saw (with wonder) their agility, the symmetry of their bodies,<br>their grace, their calmness, the firmness of their grasp and their<br>deftness in the use of sword and buckler. Then Vrikodara and Suyodhana,<br>internally delighted (at the prospect of fight), entered the arena, mace<br>in hand, like two single-peaked mountains. And those mighty-armed<br>warriors braced their loins, and summoning all their energy, roared like<br>two infuriate elephants contending for a cow-elephant; and like two<br>infuriated elephants those mighty heroes faultlessly (in consonance with<br>the dictates of the science of arm) careered right and left, circling the<br>lists. And Vidura described to Dhritarashtra and the mother of the<br>Pandavas (Kunti) and Gandhari, all the feats of the princes.'"
