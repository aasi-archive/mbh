                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'This our celebrated race, resplendent with every virtue<br>and accomplishment, hath all along sovereignty over all other monarchs on<br>earth. Its glory maintained and itself perpetuated by many virtuous and<br>illustrious monarchs of old, the illustrious Krishna (Dwaipayana) and<br>Satyavati and myself have raised you (three) up, in order that it may not<br>be extinct. It behoveth myself and thee also to take such steps that this<br>our dynasty may expand again as the sea. It hath been heard by me that<br>there are three maidens worthy of being allied to our race. One is the<br>daughter of (Surasena of) the Yadava race; the other is the daughter of<br>Suvala; and the third is the princess of Madra. O son, all these maidens<br>are of course of blue blood. Possessed of beauty and pure blood, they are<br>eminently fit for an alliance with our family. O thou foremost of<br>intelligent men, I think we should choose them for the growth of our<br>race. Tell me what thou thinkest.' Thus addressed, Vidura replied, 'Thou<br>art our father and thou art our mother, too. Thou art our respected<br>spiritual instructor. Therefore, do thou what may be best for us in thy<br>eyes.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Soon after Bhishma heard from the Brahmanas<br>that Gandhari, the amiable daughter of Suvala, having worshipped Hara<br>(Siva) had obtained from the deity the boon that she should have a<br>century of sons. Bhishma, the grandfather of the Kurus, having heard<br>this, sent messengers unto the king of Gandhara. King Suvala at first<br>hesitated on account of the blindness of the bridegroom, but taking into<br>consideration the blood of the Kurus, their fame and behaviour, he gave<br>his virtuous daughter unto Dhritarashtra and the chaste Gandhari hearing<br>that Dhritarashtra was blind and that her parents had consented to marry<br>her to him, from love and respect for her future husband, blindfolded her<br>own eyes. Sakuni, the son of Suvala, bringing unto the Kurus his sister<br>endued with youth and beauty, formally gave her away unto Dhritarashtra.<br>And Gandhari was received with great respect and the nuptials were<br>celebrated with great pomp under Bhishma's directions. And the heroic<br>Sakuni, after having bestowed his sister along with many valuable robes,<br>and having received Bhishma's adorations, returned to his own city. And,<br>O thou of Bharata's race, the beautiful Gandhari gratified all the Kurus<br>by her behaviour and respectful attentions. And Gandhari, ever devoted to<br>her husband, gratified her superiors by her good conduct; and as she was<br>chaste, she never referred even by words to men other than her husband or<br>such superiors.'"
