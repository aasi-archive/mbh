                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'O adorable one, I desire to hear the histories of<br>those kings who were descended from Puru. O tell me of each as he was<br>possessed of prowess and achievements. I have, indeed, heard that in<br>Puru's line there was not a single one who was wanting in good behaviour<br>and prowess, or who was without sons. O thou of ascetic wealth, I desire<br>to hear the histories in detail of those famous monarchs endued with<br>learning and all accomplishments.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Asked by thee, I shall tell thee all about the<br>heroic-kings in Puru's line, all equal unto Indra in prowess, possessing<br>great affluence and commanding the respect of all for their<br>accomplishments.<br><br>"Puru had by his wife Paushti three sons, Pravira, Iswara, and Raudraswa,<br>all of whom were mighty car-warriors. Amongst them, Pravira was the<br>perpetuator of the dynasty. Pravira had by his wife Suraseni a son named<br>Manasyu. And the latter of eyes like lotus-petals had his sway over the<br>whole Earth bounded by the four seas. And Manasyu had for his wife<br>Sauviri. And he begat upon her three sons called Sakta, Sahana, and<br>Vagmi. And they were heroes in battle and mighty car-warriors. The<br>intelligent and virtuous Kaudraswa begat upon the Apsara Misrakesi ten<br>sons who were all great bowmen. And they all grew up into heroes,<br>performing numerous sacrifices in honour of the gods. And they all had<br>sons, were learned in all branches of knowledge and ever devoted to<br>virtue. They are Richeyu, and Kaksreyu and Vrikeyu of great prowess;<br>Sthandileyu, and Vaneyu, and Jaleyu of great fame; Tejeyu of great<br>strength and intelligence; and Satyeyu of the prowess of Indra; Dharmeyu,<br>and Sannateyu the tenth of the prowess of the celestials. Amongst them<br>all, Richeyu became the sole monarch of the whole earth and was known by<br>the name of Anadhrishti. And in prowess he was like unto Vasava amongst<br>the celestials. And Anadhristi had a son of the name of Matinara who<br>became a famous and virtuous king and performed the Rajasuya and the<br>horse-sacrifice. And Matinara had four sons of immeasurable prowess,<br>viz., Tansu, Mahan, Atiratha, and Druhyu of immeasurable glory. (Amongst<br>them, Tansu of great prowess became the perpetrator of Puru's line). And<br>he subjugated the whole earth and acquired great fame and splendour. And<br>Tansu begat a son of great prowess named Ilina. And he became the<br>foremost of all conquerors and brought the whole world under his<br>subjection. And Ilina begat upon his wife Rathantara five sons with<br>Dushmanta at their head, all equal in might unto the five elements. They<br>were Dushmanta, Sura, Bhima, Pravasu, and Vasu. And, O Janamejaya, the<br>eldest of them, Dushmanta, became king. And Dushmanta had by his wife<br>Sakuntala an intelligent son named Bharata who became king. And Bharata<br>gave his name to the race of which he was the founder. And it is from him<br>that the fame of that dynasty hath spread so wide. And Bharata begat upon<br>his three wives nine sons in all. But none of them were like their father<br>and so Bharata was not at all pleased with them. Their mothers,<br>therefore, became angry and slew them all. The procreation of children by<br>Bharata, therefore, became vain. The monarch then performed a great<br>sacrifice and through the grace of Bharadwaja obtained a son named<br>Bhumanyu. And then Bharata, the great descendant of Puru, regarding<br>himself as really possessing a son, installed, O foremost one of<br>Bharata's race, that son as his heir-apparent. And Bhumanyu begat upon<br>his wife, Pushkarini six sons named Suhotra, Suhotri, Suhavih, Sujeya,<br>Diviratha and Kichika. The eldest of them all, Suhotra, obtained the<br>throne and performed many Rajasuyas and horse-sacrifices. And Suhotra<br>brought under his sway the whole earth surrounded by her belt of seas and<br>full of elephants, kine and horses, and all her wealth of gems of gold.<br>And the earth afflicted with the weight of numberless human beings and<br>elephants, horses, and cats, was, as it were, about to sink. And during<br>the virtuous reign of Suhotra the surface of the whole earth was dotted<br>all over with hundreds and thousands, of sacrificial stakes. And the lord<br>of the earth, Suhotra, begat, upon his wife Aikshaki three sons, viz.,<br>Ajamidha, Sumidha, and Purumidha. The eldest of them, Ajamidha, was the<br>perpetuator of the royal line. And he begat six sons,&#8212;Riksha was born of<br>the womb of Dhumini, Dushmanta and Parameshthin, of Nili, and Jahnu, Jala<br>and Rupina were born in that of Kesini. All the tribes of the Panchalas<br>are descended from Dushmanta and Parameshthin. And the Kushikas are the<br>sons of Jahnu of immeasurable prowess. And Riksha who was older than both<br>Jala and Rupina became king. And Riksha begat Samvarana, the perpetuator<br>of the royal line. And, O king, it hath been heard by us that while<br>Samvarana, the son of Riksha, was ruling the earth, there happened a<br>great loss of people from famine, pestilence, drought, and disease. And<br>the Bharata princes were beaten by the troops of enemies. And the<br>Panchalas setting out to invade the whole earth with their four kinds of<br>troops soon brought the whole earth under their sway. And with their ten<br>Akshauhinis the king of the Panchalas defeated the Bharata prince.<br>Samvarana then with his wife and ministers, sons and relatives, fled in<br>fear, and took shelter in the forest on the banks of the Sindhu extending<br>to the foot of the mountains. There the Bharatas lived for a full<br>thousand years, within their fort. And after they had lived there a<br>thousand years, one day the illustrious Rishi Vasishtha approached the<br>exiled Bharatas, who, on going out, saluted the Rishi and worshipped him<br>by the offer of Arghya. And entertaining him with reverence, they<br>represented everything unto that illustrious Rishi. And after he was<br>seated on his seat, the king himself approached the Rishi and addressed<br>him, saying, 'Be thou our priest, O illustrious one! We will endeavour to<br>regain our kingdom.' And Vasishtha answered the Bharatas by saying, 'Om'<br>(the sign of consent). It hath been heard by us that Vasishtha then<br>installed the Bharata prince in the sovereignty of all the Kshatriyas on<br>earth, making by virtue of his Mantras this descendant of Puru the<br>veritable horns of the wild bull or the tusks of the wild elephants. And<br>the king retook the capital that had been taken away from him and once<br>more made all monarchs pay tribute to him. The powerful Samvarana, thus<br>installed once more in the actual sovereignty of the whole earth,<br>performed many sacrifices at which the presents to the Brahmanas were<br>great.<br><br>"Samvarana begat upon his wife, Tapati, the daughter of Surya, a son<br>named Kuru. This Kuru was exceedingly virtuous, and therefore, he was<br>installed on the throne by his people. It is after his name that the<br>field called Kuru-jangala has become so famous in the world. Devoted to<br>asceticism, he made that field (Kurukshetra) sacred by practising<br>asceticism there. And it has been heard by us that Kuru's highly<br>intelligent wife, Vahini, brought forth five sons, viz., Avikshit,<br>Bhavishyanta, Chaitraratha, Muni and the celebrated Janamejaya. And<br>Avikshit begat Parikshit the powerful, Savalaswa, Adhiraja, Viraja,<br>Salmali of great physical strength, Uchaihsravas, Bhangakara and Jitari<br>the eighth. In the race of these were born, as the fruit of their pious<br>acts seven mighty car-warriors with Janamejaya at their head. And unto<br>Parikshit were born sons who were all acquainted with (the secrets of)<br>religion and profit. And they were named Kakshasena and Ugrasena, and<br>Chitrasena endued with great energy, and Indrasena and Sushena and<br>Bhimasena. And the sons of Janamejaya were all endued with great strength<br>and became celebrated all over the world. And they were Dhritarashtra who<br>was the eldest, and Pandu and Valhika, and Nishadha endued with great<br>energy, and then the mighty Jamvunada, and then Kundodara and Padati and<br>then Vasati the eighth. And they were all proficient in morality and<br>profit and were kind to all creatures. Among them Dhritarashtra became<br>king. And Dhritarashtra had eight sons, viz., Kundika, Hasti, Vitarka,<br>Kratha the fifth, Havihsravas, Indrabha, and Bhumanyu the invincible, and<br>Dhritarashtra had many grandsons, of whom three only were famous. They<br>were, O king, Pratipa, Dharmanetra, Sunetra. Among these three, Pratipa<br>became unrivalled on earth. And, O bull in Bharata's race, Pratipa begat<br>three sons, viz., Devapi, Santanu, and the mighty car-warrior Valhika.<br>The eldest Devapi adopted the ascetic course of life, impelled thereto by<br>the desire of benefiting his brothers. And the kingdom was obtained by<br>Santanu and the mighty car-warrior Valhika.<br><br>"O monarch, besides, there were born in the race of Bharata numberless<br>other excellent monarchs endued with great energy and like unto the<br>celestial Rishis themselves in virtue and ascetic power. And so also in<br>the race of Manu were born many mighty car-warriors like unto the<br>celestials themselves, who by their number swelled the Aila dynasty into<br>gigantic proportions.'"
