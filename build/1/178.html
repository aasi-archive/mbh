                            (Chaitraratha Parva continued)<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'There was, O Partha, a king in this world,<br>named Kalmashapada, who was of the race of Ikshvaku and was unequalled on<br>earth for prowess. One day the king went from his capital into the woods<br>for purposes of hunting, and this grinder of foes pierced (with his<br>arrows) many deer and wild boars. And in those deep woods the king also<br>slew many rhinoceroses. Engaged in sport for some length of time, the<br>monarch became very much fatigued and at last he gave up the chase,<br>desiring to rest awhile.<br><br>"The great Viswamitra, endued with energy, had, a little while ago,<br>desired to make that monarch his disciple. As the monarch, afflicted with<br>hunger and thirst, was proceeding through the woods, he came across that<br>best of Rishis, the illustrious son of Vasishtha, coming along the same<br>path. The king ever victorious in battle saw that Muni bearing the name<br>of Saktri, that illustrious propagator of Vasishtha's race, the eldest of<br>the high-souled Vasishtha's hundred sons, coming along from opposite<br>direction. The king, beholding him said, 'Stand out of our way.' The<br>Rishi, addressing the monarch in a conciliatory manner, said unto him<br>sweetly, 'O king, this is my way. This is the eternal rule of morality<br>indicated in every treatise on duty and religion, viz., that a king<br>should ever make way for Brahmanas.' Thus did they address each other<br>respecting their right of way. 'Stand aside, stand aside', were the words<br>they said unto each other. The Rishi, who was in the right, did not<br>yield, nor did the king yield to him from pride and anger. That best of<br>monarchs, enraged at the Rishi, refusing to yield him the way, acted like<br>a Rakshasa, striking him with his whip. Thus whipped by the monarch, that<br>best of Rishis, the son of Vasishtha, was deprived of his senses by<br>anger, and speedily cursed that first of monarchs, saying, 'O worst of<br>kings, since thou persecutest like a Rakshasa an ascetic, thou shalt from<br>this day, became a Rakshasa subsisting on human flesh! Hence, thou worst<br>of kings! thou shalt wander over the earth, affecting human form!' Thus<br>did the Rishi Sakti, endued with great prowess, speak unto king<br>Kalmashapada. At this time Viswamitra, between whom and Vasishtha there<br>was a dispute about the discipleship of Kalmashapada, approached the<br>place where that monarch and Vasishtha's son were. And, O Partha, that<br>Rishi of severe ascetic penances, viz., Viswamitra of great energy,<br>approached the pair (knowing by his spiritual insight that they had been<br>thus quarrelling with each other). After the curse had been pronounced,<br>that best of monarchs knew that Rishi to be Vasishtha's son and equal<br>unto Vasishtha himself in energy. And, O Bharata, Viswamitra, desirous of<br>benefiting himself, remained on that spot, concealed from the sight of<br>both by making himself invisible. Then that best of monarchs, thus cursed<br>by Saktri, desiring to propitiate the Rishi began to humbly beseech him.<br>And, O chief of the Kurus, Viswamitra, ascertaining the disposition of<br>the king (and fearing that the difference might be made up), ordered a<br>Rakshasa to enter the body of the king. And a Rakshasa of the name of<br>Kinkara then entered the monarch's body in obedience to Saktri's curse<br>and Viswamitra's command. And knowing, O chastiser of foes, that the<br>Rakshasa had possessed himself of the monarch, that best of Rishis,<br>Viswamitra, then left the spot and went away.<br><br>"Shortly after, O Partha, the monarch, possessed by the Rakshasa and<br>terribly afflicted by him, lost all his senses. At this time a Brahmana<br>beheld the king in the woods. Afflicted with hunger, that Brahmana begged<br>of the king some food with meat. The royal sage, Kalmashapada, that<br>cherisher of friends, answered the Brahmana, saying, 'Stay thou here, O<br>Brahmana for a moment. On my return, I will give thee whatever food thou<br>desirest.' Having said this, the monarch went away, but the Brahmana<br>stayed on there. The high-minded king having roved for some time at<br>pleasure and according to his will, at last entered his inner apartment.<br>Thus waking at midnight and remembering his promise, he summoned his cook<br>and told him of his promise unto the Brahmana staying in the forest. And<br>he commanded him, saying, 'Hie thee to that forest. A Brahmana waiteth<br>for me in the hope of food. Go and entertain him with food and meat.'<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'Thus commanded, the cook went out in search of<br>meat. Distressed at not having found any, he informed the king of his<br>failure. The monarch, however, possessed as he was by the Rakshasa,<br>repeatedly said, without scruple of any kind, 'Feed him with human<br>flesh.' The cook, saying, 'So be it,' went to the place where the<br>(king's) executioners were, and thence taking human flesh and washing and<br>cooking it duly and covering it with boiled rice offered it unto that<br>hungry Brahmana devoted to ascetic penances. But that best of Brahmanas,<br>seeing with his spiritual sight that the food was unholy and, therefore,<br>unworthy of being eaten, said these words with eyes red with anger,<br>'Because that worst of kings offereth me food that is unholy and unworthy<br>of being taken, therefore that wretch shall have himself a fondness for<br>such food. And becoming fond of human flesh as cursed by Saktri of old,<br>the wretch shall wander over the earth, alarming and otherwise troubling<br>all creatures.' The curse, therefore, on that king, thus repeated a<br>second time, became very strong, and the king, possessed by a Rakshasa<br>disposition, soon lost all his senses.<br><br>"A little while after, O Bharata, that best of monarchs, deprived of all<br>his senses by the Rakshasa within him, beholding Saktri who had cursed<br>him, said, 'Because thou hast pronounced on me this extraordinary curse,<br>therefore, I shall begin my life of cannibalism by devouring thee.'<br>Having said this, the king immediately slew Saktri and ate him up, like a<br>tiger eating the animal it was fond of. Beholding Saktri thus slain and<br>devoured, Viswamitra repeatedly urged that Rakshasa (who was within the<br>monarch) against the other sons of Vasishtha. Like a wrathful lion<br>devouring small animals, that Rakshasa soon devoured the other sons of<br>the illustrious Vasishtha that were junior to Saktri in age. But<br>Vasishtha, learning that all his sons had been caused to be slain by<br>Viswamitra, patiently bore his grief like the great mountain that bears<br>the earth. That best of Munis, that foremost of intelligent men, was<br>resolved rather to sacrifice his own life than exterminate (in anger) the<br>race of Kusikas. The illustrious Rishi threw himself down from the summit<br>of Meru, but he descended on the stony ground as though on a heap of<br>cotton. And, O son of Pandu, when the illustrious one found that death<br>did not result from that fall, he kindled a huge fire in the forest and<br>entered it with alacrity. But that fire, though burning brightly,<br>consumed him not. O slayer of foes, that blazing fire seemed to him cool.<br>Then the great Muni under the influence of grief, beholding the sea, tied<br>a stony weight to his neck and threw himself into its waters. But the<br>waves soon cast him ashore. At last when that Brahmana of rigid vows<br>succeeded not in killing himself by any means, he returned, in distress<br>of heart, to his asylum.'"
