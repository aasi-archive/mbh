                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'After this, with his sheet loosely hanging down,<br>Adhiratha entered the lists, perspiring and trembling, and supporting<br>himself on a staff.<br><br>"Seeing him, Karna left his bow and impelled by filial regard bowed down<br>his head still wet with the water of inauguration. And them the<br>charioteer, hurriedly covering his feet with the end of his sheet,<br>addressed Karna crowned with success as his son. And the charioteer<br>embraced Karna and from excess of affection bedewed his head with tears,<br>that head still wet with the water sprinkled over it on account of the<br>coronation as king of Anga. Seeing the charioteer, the Pandava Bhimasena<br>took Karna for a charioteer's son, and said by way of ridicule, 'O son of<br>a charioteer, thou dost not deserve death in fight at the hands of<br>Partha. As befits thy race take thou anon the whip. And, O worst of<br>mortals, surely thou art not worthy to sway the kingdom of Anga, even as<br>a dog doth not deserve the butter placed before the sacrificial fire.'<br>Karna, thus addressed, with slightly quivering lips fetched a deep sigh,<br>looked at the God of the day in the skies. And even as a mad elephant<br>riseth from an assemblage of lotuses, the mighty Duryodhana rose in wrath<br>from among his brothers, and addressed that performer of dreadful deeds,<br>Bhimasena, present there, 'O Vrikodara, it behoveth thee not to speak<br>such words. Might is the cardinal virtue of a Kshatriya, and even a<br>Kshatriya of inferior birth deserveth to be fought with. The lineage of<br>heroes, like the sources of a lordly river, is ever unknown. The fire<br>that covereth the whole world riseth from the waters. The thunder that<br>slayeth the Danavas was made of a bone of (a mortal named) Dadhichi. The<br>illustrious deity Guha, who combines in his composition the portions of<br>all the other deities is of a lineage unknown. Some call him the<br>offspring of Agni; some, of Krittika, some, of Rudra, and some of Ganga.<br>It hath been heard by us that persons born in the Kashatriya order have<br>become Brahmanas. Viswamitra and others (born Kshatriyas) have obtained<br>the eternal Brahma. The foremost of all wielders of weapons, the<br>preceptor Drona hath been born in a waterpot and Kripa of the race of<br>Gotama hath sprung from a clump of heath. Your own births, ye Pandava<br>princes, are known to me. Can a she-deer bring forth a tiger (like<br>Karna), of the splendour of the Sun, and endued with every auspicious<br>mark, and born also with a natural mail and ear-rings? This prince among<br>men deserveth the sovereignty of the world, not of Anga only, in<br>consequence of the might of his arm and my swearing to obey him in<br>everything. If there be anybody here to whom all that I have done unto<br>Karna hath become intolerable, let him ascend his chariot and bend his<br>bow with the help of his feet.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then there arose a confused murmur amongst the<br>spectators approving of Duryodhana's speech. The sun, however, went down,<br>but prince Duryodhana taking Karna's hand led him out of the arena<br>lighted with countless lamps. And, O king, the Pandavas also, accompanied<br>by Drona and Kripa and Bhishma, returned to their abodes. And the people,<br>too, came away, some naming Arjuna, some Karna, and some Duryodhana (as<br>the victor of the day). And Kunti, recognising her son in Karna by the<br>various auspicious marks on his person and beholding him installed in the<br>sovereignty of Anga, was from motherly affection, very pleased. And<br>Duryodhana, O monarch, having obtained Karna (in this way), banished his<br>fears arising out of Arjuna's proficiency in arms. And the heroic Karna,<br>accomplished in arms, began to gratify Duryodhana by sweet speeches,<br>while Yudhishthira was impressed with the belief that there was no<br>warrior on earth like unto Karna.'"
