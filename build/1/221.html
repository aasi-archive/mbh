                            (Subhadra-harana Parva)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'O best of monarchs, within a few days after this,<br>there commenced on the Raivataka mountain, a grand festival of the<br>Vrishnis and the Andhakas. At the mountain-festival of the Bhojas, the<br>Vrishnis and the Andhakas, the heroes of those tribes began to give away<br>much wealth unto Brahmanas by thousands. The region around that hill, O<br>king was adorned with many a mansion decked with gems and many an<br>artificial tree of gaudy hue. The musicians struck up in concert and the<br>dancers began to dance and the vocalists to sing. And the youth of the<br>Vrishni race, endued with great energy, adorned with every ornament, and<br>riding in their gold-decked cars, looked extremely handsome. The<br>citizens, some on foot and some in excellent cars, with their wives and<br>followers were there by hundreds and thousands. And there was the lord<br>Haladhara (Valarama), roving at will, hilarious with drink, accompanied<br>by (his wife) Revati, and followed by many musicians and vocalists. There<br>came Ugrasena also, the powerful king of he Vrishni race, accompanied by<br>his thousand wives and followed by sweet singers. And Raukmineya and<br>Shamva also, ever furious in battle, roved there, excited with drink and<br>adorned with floral wreaths of great beauty and with costly attires, and<br>disported themselves like a pair of celestials. And Akrura and Sarana and<br>Gada, and Vabhru, and Nisatha, and Charudeshna, and Prithu, Viprithu, and<br>Satyaka, and Satyaki, and Bhangakara, and Maharava, and Hardikya, and<br>Uddhava, and many others whose names are not given, accompanied by their<br>wives that followed by bands of singers, adorned that mountain-festival.<br>When that delightful festival of immense grandeur commenced, Vasudeva and<br>Partha went about, together, beholding everything around. While wandering<br>there, they saw the handsome daughter of Vasudeva, Bhadra by name, decked<br>with every ornament, in the midst of her maids. As soon as Arjuna beheld<br>her he was possessed by the god of desire. Then, O Bharata, that tiger<br>among men, Krishna, observing Partha contemplate her with absorbed<br>attention, said with a smile, 'How is this? Can the heart of one that<br>rangeth the woods be agitated by the god of desire? This is my sister, O<br>Partha, and the uterine sister of Sarana. Blest be thou, her name is<br>Bhadra and she is the favourite daughter of my father. Tell me if thy<br>heart is fixed upon her, for I shall then speak to my father myself.'<br><br>"Arjuna answered, 'She is Vasudeva's daughter and Vasudeva's (Krishna)<br>sister; endued with so much beauty, whom can she not fascinate? If this<br>thy sister, this maid of the Vrishni race, becometh my wife, truly may I<br>win prosperity in everything. Tell me, O Janardana, by what means I may<br>obtain her. To get her I will achieve anything that is achievable by man.'<br><br>"Vasudeva answered, 'O bull amongst men, self-choice hath been ordained<br>for the marriage of Kshatriyas. But that is doubtful (in its<br>consequences), O Partha, as we do not know this girl's temper and<br>disposition. In the case of Kshatriyas that are brave, a forcible<br>abduction for purposes of marriage is applauded, as the learned have<br>said. Therefore O Arjuna, carry away this my beautiful sister by force,<br>for who knows what she may do at a self-choice.' Then Krishna and Arjuna,<br>having thus settled as to what should be done sent some speedy messengers<br>unto Yudhishthira at Indraprastha, informing him of everything. The<br>strong-armed Yudhishthira, as soon as he heard it, gave his assent to<br>it.'"
