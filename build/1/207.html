                            (Viduragamana Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'After Drona had ceased, Vidura spoke, saying, 'O<br>monarch, thy friends without doubt, are saying unto thee what is for thy<br>good. But as thou art unwilling to listen to what they say, their words<br>scarcely find a place in thy ears. What that foremost one of Kuru's race,<br>viz., Bhishma, the son of Santanu, hath said, is excellent and is for thy<br>good. But thou dost not listen to it. The preceptor Drona also hath said<br>much that is for thy good which however Karna, the son of Radha, doth not<br>regard to be such. But, O king, reflecting hard I do not find any one who<br>is better a friend to thee than either of these two lions among men<br>(viz., Bhishma and Drona), or any one who excels either of them in<br>wisdom. These two, old in years, in wisdom, and in learning, always<br>regard thee, O king, and the sons of Pandu with equal eyes. Without<br>doubt, O king of Bharata's race, they are both, in virtue and<br>truthfulness, not inferior to Rama, the son of Dasaratha, and Gaya. Never<br>before did they give thee any evil advice. Thou also, O monarch, hast<br>never done them any injury. Why should, therefore, these tigers among<br>men, who are ever truthful, give thee wicked advice, especially when thou<br>hast never injured them? Endued with wisdom these foremost of men, O<br>king, will never give thee counsels that are crooked. O scion of Kuru's<br>rate, this is my firm conviction that these two, acquainted with all<br>rules of morality, will never, tempted by wealth, utter anything<br>betraying a spirit of partisanship. What they have said, O Bharata, I<br>regard highly beneficial to thee. Without doubt, O monarch, the Pandavas<br>are thy sons as much as Duryodhana and others are. Those ministers,<br>therefore, that give thee any counsel fraught with evil unto the<br>Pandavas, do not really look to thy interests. If there is any partiality<br>in thy heart, O king, for thy own children, they who by their counsel<br>seek to bring it out, certainly do thee no good. Therefore, O king, these<br>illustrious persons endued with great splendour, have not I think, said<br>anything that leadeth to evil. Thou, however, dost not understand it.<br>What these bulls among men have said regarding the invincibility of the<br>Pandavas is perfectly true. Think not otherwise of it, O tiger among men.<br>Blest be thou! Can the handsome Dhananjaya, the son of Pandu, using the<br>right and the left hand with equal activity, be vanquished in battle even<br>by Maghavat himself? Can the great Bhimasena of strong arms possessing<br>the might of ten thousand elephants, be vanquished in battle by the<br>immortals themselves? Who also that desireth to live can overcome in<br>battle the twins (Nagula and Sahadeva) like unto the sons of Yama<br>himself, and well-skilled in fight? How too can the eldest one of the<br>Pandavas in whom patience, mercy, forgiveness, truth, and prowess always<br>live together, be vanquished? They who have Rama (Valadeva) as their<br>ally, and Janardana (Krishna) as their counsellor, and Satyaki as their<br>partisan, have already defeated everybody in war. They who have Drupada<br>for their father-in-law, and Drupada's sons&#8212;the heroic brothers, viz.,<br>Dhristadyumna and others of Prishata's race for their brothers-in-law,<br>are certainly invincible. Remembering this, O monarch, and knowing that<br>their claim to the kingdom is even prior to thine, behave virtuously<br>towards them. The stain of calumny is on thee, O monarch, in consequence<br>of that act of Purochana. Wash thyself of it now, by a kindly behaviour<br>towards the Pandavas. This kindly behaviour of thine, O monarch, towards<br>the Pandavas will be an act of great benefit to us, protecting the lives<br>of us all that belong to Kuru's race, and leading to the growth of the<br>whole Kshatriya order! We had formerly warred with king Drupada; if we<br>can now secure him as an ally, it will strengthen our party. The<br>Dasarhas, O king, are numerous and strong. Know where Krishna is, all of<br>them must be, and where Krishna is, there victory also must be! O king,<br>who, unless cursed by the gods, would seek, to effect that by means of<br>war which can be effected by conciliation? Hearing that the sons of<br>Pritha are alive, the citizens and other subjects of the realm have<br>become exceedingly glad and eager for beholding them. O monarch, act in a<br>way that is agreeable to them. Duryodhana and Karna and Sakuni, the son<br>of Suvala, are sinful, foolish and young; listen not to them. Possessed<br>of every virtue thou art I long ago told thee, O monarch that for<br>Duryodhana's fault, the subjects of this kingdom would be exterminated.'"
