                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Sukra continued, 'Know, then, O Devayani, that he that mindeth not the<br>evil speeches of others, conquereth everything! The wise say that he is a<br>true charioteer who without slackening holdeth tightly the reins of his<br>horses. He, therefore, is the true man that subdueth, without indulging<br>in his rising wrath. Know thou, O Devayani, that by him is everything<br>conquered, who calmly subdueth his rising anger. He is regarded as a man<br>who by having recourse to forgiveness, shaketh off his rising anger like<br>a snake casting off its slough He that suppresseth his anger, he that<br>regardeth not the evil speeches of others, he that becometh not angry,<br>though there be cause, certainly acquireth the four objects for which we<br>live (viz., virtue, profit, desire, and salvation) Between him that<br>performeth without fatigue sacrifices every month for a hundred years,<br>and him that never feeleth angry at anything, he that feeleth not wrath<br>is certainly the higher. Boys and girls, unable to distinguish between<br>right and wrong, quarrel with each other. The wise never imitate them.'<br>Devayani, on hearing this speech of her father, said, 'O father, I know,<br>also what the difference is between anger and forgiveness as regards the<br>power of each. But when a disciple behaveth disrespectfully, he should<br>never be forgiven by the preceptor if the latter is really desirous of<br>benefiting the former. Therefore, I do not desire to live any longer in a<br>country where evil behaviour is at a premium. The wise man desirous of<br>good, should not dwell among those sinfully inclined men who always speak<br>ill of good behaviour and high birth. But there should one live,&#8212;indeed,<br>that hath been said to be the best of dwelling places,&#8212;where good<br>behaviour and purity of birth are known and respected. The cruel words<br>uttered by Vrishaparvan's daughter burn my heart even as men, desirous of<br>kindling a fire, burn the dry fuel. I do not think anything more<br>miserable for a man in the three worlds than to adore one's enemies<br>blessed with good fortune, himself possessing none. It hath been indeed<br>said by the learned that for such a man even death would be better.'"
