                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'O thou of ascetic wealth, soon after her lord had left her,<br>Jaratkaru went to her brother. And she told him everything that had<br>happened. And the prince of snakes, hearing the calamitous news, spake<br>unto his miserable sister, himself more miserable still.'<br><br>"And he said, 'Thou knowest, 'O amiable one, the purpose of thy bestowal,<br>the reason thereof. If, from that union, for the welfare of the snakes, a<br>son be born, then he, possessed of energy, will save us all from the<br>snake-sacrifice. The Grandsire had said so, of old, in the midst of the<br>gods. O fortunate one, hast thou conceived from thy union with that best<br>of Rishis? My heart's desire is that my bestowal of thee on that wise one<br>may not be fruitless. Truly, it is not proper for me to ask thee about<br>this. But from the gravity of the interests I ask thee this. Knowing also<br>the obstinacy of thy lord, ever engaged in severe penances, I shall not<br>follow him, for he may curse me. Tell me in detail all that thy lord, O<br>amiable one, hath done, and extract that terribly afflicting dart that<br>lies implanted for a long time past in my heart.'<br><br>"Jaratkaru, thus addressed, consoling Vasuki, the king of the snakes, at<br>length replied, saying, 'Asked by me about offspring, the high-souled and<br>mighty ascetic said, 'There is,'&#8212;and then he went away. I do not<br>remember him to have ever before speak even in jest aught that is false.<br>Why should he, O king, speak a falsehood on such a serious occasion? He<br>said, 'Thou shouldst not grieve, O daughter of the snake race, about the<br>intended result of our union. A son shall be born to thee, resplendent as<br>the blazing sun.' O brother, having said this to me, my husband of<br>ascetic wealth went away&#8212;Therefore, let the deep sorrow cherished in thy<br>heart disappear.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Thus addressed, Vasuki, the king of the snakes,<br>accepted those words of his sister, and in great joy said, 'Be it so!'<br>And the chief of the snakes then adored his sister with his best regards,<br>gift of wealth, and fitting eulogies. Then, O best of Brahmanas, the<br>embryo endued with great splendour, began to develop, like the moon in<br>the heavens in the bright fortnight.<br><br>And in due time, the sister of the snakes, O Brahmana, gave birth to a<br>son of the splendour of a celestial child, who became the reliever of the<br>fears of his ancestors and maternal relatives. The child grew up there in<br>the house of the king of the snakes. He studied the Vedas and their<br>branches with the ascetic Chyavana, the son of Bhrigu. And though but a<br>boy, his vows were rigid. And he was gifted with great intelligence, and<br>with the several attributes of virtue, knowledge, freedom from the<br>world's indulgences, and saintliness. And the name by which he was known<br>to the world was Astika. And he was known by the name of Astika (whoever<br>is) because his father had gone to the woods, saying. 'There is', when he<br>was in the womb. Though but a boy, he had great gravity and intelligence.<br>And he was reared with great care in the palace of the snakes. And he was<br>like the illustrious lord of the celestials, Mahadeva of the golden form,<br>the wielder of the trident. And he grew up day by day, the delight of all<br>the snakes.'"
