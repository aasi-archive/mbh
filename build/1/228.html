                            (Khandava-daha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then those foremost of car-warriors (Krishna and<br>Arjuna), riding in their cars and placing themselves on opposite sides of<br>that forest, began a great slaughter, on all sides, of the creatures<br>dwelling in Khandava. At whatever point any of the creatures residing in<br>Khandava could be seen attempting to escape, thither rushed those mighty<br>heroes (to prevent its flight). Indeed those two excellent cars seemed to<br>be but one, and the two warriors also therein but one individual. And<br>while the forest was burning, hundreds and thousands of living creatures,<br>uttering frightful yells, began to run about in all directions. Some had<br>particular limbs burnt, some were scorched with excessive heat, and some<br>came out, and some ran about from fear. And some clasping their children<br>and some their parents and brothers, died calmly without, from excess of<br>affection, being able to abandon these that were dear to them. And many<br>there were who biting their nether lips rose upwards and soon fell<br>whirling into the blazing element below. And some were seen to roll on<br>the ground with wings, eyes, and feet scorched and burnt. These creatures<br>were all seen to perish there almost soon enough. The tanks and ponds<br>within that forest, heated by the fire around, began to boil; the fishes<br>and the tortoises in them were all seen to perish. During that great<br>slaughter of living creatures in that forest, the burning bodies of<br>various animals looked as if fire itself had assumed many forms. The<br>birds that took wings to escape from that conflagration were pierced by<br>Arjuna with his shafts, and cut into pieces, they fell down into the<br>burning element below. Pierced all over with Arjuna's shafts, the birds<br>dropped down into the burning forest, uttering loud cries. The denizens<br>of the forest, struck with those shafts, began to roar and yell. The<br>clamour they raised was like unto the frightful uproar heard during the<br>churning of the ocean (in days of yore). The mighty flames of the blazing<br>fire reaching the firmament, caused great anxiety to the celestials<br>themselves. Then all the illustrious dwellers in heaven went in a body<br>unto him of a hundred sacrifices and thousand eyes, viz., their chief,<br>that grinder of Asuras. Approaching Indra, the celestial said, 'Why, O<br>lord of immortals, doth Agni burn these creatures below? Hath the time<br>come for the destruction of the world?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of the gods, and himself<br>beholding what Agni was doing, the slayer of Vritra set out for the<br>protection of the forest of Khandava. And Vasava, the chief of the<br>celestials soon covering the sky with masses of clouds of every kind<br>began to shower upon the burning forest. Those masses of clouds by<br>hundreds and thousands, commanded by Indra began to pour rain upon<br>Khandava in showers thick as the flag-staffs of battle-cars. But the<br>showers were all dried up in the sky itself by the heat of the fire and<br>could not, therefore, reach the fire at all! Then the slayer of Namuchi,<br>getting angry with Agni, collected huge masses of clouds and caused them<br>to yield a heavy downpour. Then with the flames contending with those<br>heavy showers, and with masses of clouds overhead, that forest, filled<br>with smoke and flashes of lightning, became terrible to behold.'"
