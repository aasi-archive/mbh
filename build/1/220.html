                            (Arjuna-vanavasa Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then Arjuna of immeasurable prowess saw, one after<br>another, all the sacred waters and other holy places that were on the<br>shores of the western ocean. Vibhatsu reached the sacred spot called<br>Prabhasa. When the invisible Arjuna arrived at that sacred and delightful<br>region, the slayer of Madhu (Krishna) heard of it. Madhava soon went<br>there to see his friend, the son of Kunti. Krishna and Arjuna met<br>together and embracing each other enquired after each other's welfare.<br>Those dear friends, who were none else than the Rishis Nara and Narayana<br>of old, sat down. Vasudeva asked Arjuna about his travels, saying, 'Why,<br>O Pandava art thou wandering over the earth, beholding all the sacred<br>waters and other holy places?' Then Arjuna told him everything that had<br>happened. Hearing everything, that mighty hero of Vrishni's race said,<br>'This is as it should be.' And Krishna and Arjuna having sported as they<br>liked, for some time at Prabhasa, went to the Raivataka mountain to pass<br>some days there. Before they arrived at Raivataka, that mountain had, at<br>the command of Krishna been well-adorned by many artificers. Much food<br>also had, at Krishna's command, been collected there. Enjoying everything<br>that had been collected there for him, Arjuna sat with Vasudeva to see<br>the performances of the actors and the dancers. Then the high-souled<br>Pandava, dismissing them all with proper respect, laid himself down on a<br>well-adorned and excellent bed. As the strong-armed one lay on that<br>excellent bed, he described unto Krishna everything about the sacred<br>waters, the lakes and the mountains, the rivers and the forests he had<br>seen. While he was speaking of these, stretched upon that celestial bed,<br>sleep, O Janamejaya, stole upon him. He rose in the morning, awakened, by<br>sweet songs and melodious notes of the Vina (guitar) and the panegyrics<br>and benedictions of the bards. After he had gone through the necessary<br>acts and ceremonies, he was affectionately accosted by him of the Vrishni<br>race. Riding upon a golden car, the hero then set out for Dwaraka, the<br>capital of the Yadavas. And, O Janamejaya, for honouring the son of<br>Kunti, the city of Dwaraka, was well-adorned, even all the gardens and<br>houses within it. The citizens of Dwaraka, desirous of beholding the son<br>of Kunti, began to pour eagerly into the public thoroughfares by hundreds<br>of thousands. In the public squares and thoroughfares, hundreds and<br>thousands of women, mixing with the men, swelled the great crowd of the<br>Bhojas, the Vrishnis, and the Andhakas, that had collected there. Arjuna<br>was welcomed with respect by all the sons of Bhojas, the Vrishnis, and<br>the Andhakas. And he, in his turn, worshipped those that deserved his<br>worship, receiving their blessings. The hero was welcomed with<br>affectionate reception by all the young men of the Yadava tribe. He<br>repeatedly embraced all that were equal to him in age. Wending then to<br>the delightful mansion of Krishna that was filled with gems and every<br>article of enjoyment, he took up his abode there with Krishna for many<br>days.'"
