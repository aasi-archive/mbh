                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed by his loving wife, king Pandu,<br>well-acquainted with all rules of morality, replied in these words of<br>virtuous import, 'O Kunti, what thou hast said is quite true. Vyushitaswa<br>of old did even as thou hast said. Indeed he was equal unto the<br>celestials themselves. But I shall now tell thee about the practices of<br>old indicated by illustrious Rishis, fully acquainted with every rule of<br>morality. O thou of handsome face and sweet smiles, women formerly were<br>not immured within houses and dependent on husbands and other relatives.<br>They used to go about freely, enjoying themselves as best as they liked.<br>O thou of excellent qualities, they did not then adhere to their husbands<br>faithfully, and yet, O handsome one, they were not regarded sinful, for<br>that was the sanctioned usage of the times. That very usage is followed<br>to this day by birds and beasts without any (exhibition of) jealousy.<br>That practice, sanctioned by precedent, is applauded by great Rishis. O<br>thou of taper thighs, the practice is yet regarded with respect amongst<br>the Northern Kurus. Indeed, that usage, so lenient to women, hath the<br>sanction of antiquity. The present practice, however (of women's being<br>confined to one husband for life) hath been established but lately. I<br>shall tell thee in detail who established it and why.<br><br>"It hath been heard by us that there was a great Rishi of the name of<br>Uddalaka, who had a son named Swetaketu who also was an ascetic of merit.<br>O thou of eyes like lotus-petals, the present virtuous practice hath been<br>established by that Swetaketu from anger. Hear thou the reason. One day,<br>in the presence of Swetaketu's father a Brahmana came and catching<br>Swetaketu's mother by the hand, told her, 'Let us go.' Beholding his<br>mother seized by the hand and taken away apparently by force, the son was<br>greatly moved by wrath. Seeing his son indignant, Uddalaka addressed him<br>and said, 'Be not angry. O son! This is the practice sanctioned by<br>antiquity. The women of all orders in this world are free, O son; men in<br>this matter, as regards their respective orders, act as kine.' The<br>Rishi's son, Swetaketu, however, disapproved of the usage and established<br>in the world the present practice as regards men and women. It hath been<br>heard by us, O thou of great virtue, that the existing practice dates<br>from that period among human beings but not among beings of other<br>classes. Accordingly, since the establishment of the present usage, it is<br>sinful for women not to adhere to their husbands. Women transgressing the<br>limits assigned by the Rishi became guilty of slaying the embryo. And,<br>men, too, viol ting a chaste and loving wife who hath from her maidenhood<br>observed the vow of purity, became guilty of the same sin. The woman also<br>who, being commanded by her husband to raise offspring, refuses to do his<br>bidding, becometh equally sinful.<br><br>"Thus, O timid one, was the existing usage established of old by<br>Swetaketu, the son of Uddalaka, in defiance of antiquity. O thou of taper<br>thighs, it hath also been heard by us that Madayanti, the wife of<br>Saudasa, commanded by her husband to raise offspring went unto Rishi<br>Vasishtha. And on going in unto him, the handsome Madayanti obtained a<br>son named Asmaka. She did this, moved by the desire of doing good to her<br>husband. O thou of lotus-eyes, thou knowest, O timid girl, how we<br>ourselves, for the perpetuation of the Kuru race, were begotten by<br>Krishna-Dwaipayana. O faultless one, beholding all these precedents it<br>behoveth thee to do my bidding, which is not inconsistent with virtue, O<br>princess, who is devoted to her husband, it hath also been said by those<br>acquainted with the rules of morality that a wife, when her monthly<br>season cometh, must ever seek her husband, though at other times she<br>deserveth liberty. The wise have declared this to be the ancient<br>practice. But, be the act sinful or sinless, those acquainted with the<br>Vedas have declared that it is the duty of wives to do what their<br>husbands bid them do. Especially, O thou of faultless features, I, who am<br>deprived of the power of procreation, having yet become desirous of<br>beholding offspring, deserve the more to be obeyed by thee. O amiable<br>one, joining my palms furnished with rosy fingers, and making of them a<br>cup as of lotus leaves, I place them on my head to propitiate thee. O<br>thou of lair looks, it behoveth thee to raise offspring, at my command,<br>through some Brahmana possessed of high ascetic merit. For then, owing to<br>thee, O thou of fair hips, I may go the way that is reserved for those<br>that are blessed with children.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by Pandu, that subjugator of<br>hostile cities, the handsome Kunti, ever attentive to what was agreeable<br>and beneficial to her lord, then replied unto him, saying, 'In my<br>girlhood, O lord, I was in my father's house engaged in attending upon<br>all guests. I used to wait respectfully upon Brahmanas of rigid vows and<br>great ascetic merit. One day I gratified with my attentions that Brahmana<br>whom people call Durvasa, of mind under full control and possessing<br>knowledge of all the mysteries of religion. Pleased with my services,<br>that Brahmana gave me a boon in the form of a mantra (formula of<br>invocation) for calling into my presence any one of the celestials I<br>liked. And the Rishi, addressing me, said, 'Anyone among the celestials<br>whom thou callest by this shall, O girl, approach thee and be obedient to<br>thy will, whether he liketh it or not. And, O princess, thou shall also<br>have offspring through his grace.' O Bharata, that Brahmana told me this<br>when I lived in my father's house. The words uttered by the Brahmana can<br>never be false. The time also hath come when they may yield fruit.<br>Commanded by thee, O royal sage, I can by that mantra summon any of the<br>celestials, so that we may have good children. O foremost of all truthful<br>men, tell me which of the celestials I shall summon. Know that, as<br>regards this matter, I await your commands.'<br><br>"Hearing this, Pandu replied, 'O handsome one, strive duly this very day<br>to gratify our wishes. Fortunate one, summon thou the god of justice. He<br>is the most virtuous of the celestials. The god of justice and virtue<br>will never be able to pollute us with sin. The world also, O beautiful<br>princess, will then think that what we do can never be unholy. The son<br>also that we shall obtain from him shall in virtue be certainly the<br>foremost among the Kurus. Begotten by the god of justice and morality, he<br>would never set his heart upon anything that is sinful or unholy.<br>Therefore, O thou of sweet smiles, steadily keeping virtue before thy<br>eyes, and duly observing holy vows, summon thou the god of justice and<br>virtue by the help of thy solicitations and incantations.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Kunti, that best of women, thus addressed<br>by her lord, said, 'So be it.' And bowing down to him and reverently<br>circumambulating his person, she resolved to do his bidding.'"
