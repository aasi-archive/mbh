                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'There was a king known by the name of Mahabhisha<br>born in the race of Ikshvaku. He was the lord of all the earth, and was<br>truthful (in speech) and of true prowess. By a thousand horse-sacrifices<br>and a hundred Rajasuyas he had gratified the chief of the celestials and<br>ultimately attained to heaven.<br><br>"One day the celestials had assembled together and were worshipping<br>Brahman. Many royal sages and king Mahabhisha also were present on the<br>spot. And Ganga, the queen of rivers, also came there to pay her<br>adorations to the Grandsire. And her garments white as the beams of the<br>moon was displaced by the action of the wind. And as her person became<br>exposed, the celestials bent down their heads. But the royal sage<br>Mahabhisha rudely stared at the queen of rivers. And Mahabhisha was for<br>this cursed by Brahman, who said, 'Wretch, as thou hast forgotten thyself<br>at the sight of Ganga, thou shalt be re-born on earth. But thou shall<br>again and again attain to these regions. And she, too, shall be born in<br>the world of men and shall do thee injuries. But when thy wrath shall be<br>provoked, thou shalt then be freed from my curse.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'King Mahabhisha then recollecting all the<br>monarchs and ascetics on earth, wished to be born as son to Pratipa of<br>great prowess. And the queen of rivers, too, seeing king Mahabhisha lose<br>his firmness, went away, thinking of him wishfully. And on her way, she<br>saw those dwellers in heaven, the Vasus, also pursuing the same path. And<br>the queen of rivers beholding them in the predicament, asked them, 'Why<br>look ye so dejected? Ye dwellers in heaven, is everything right with<br>you?' Those celestials, the Vasus, answered her, saying, 'O queen of<br>rivers, we have been cursed, for a venial fault, by the illustrious<br>Vasishtha in anger. The foremost of excellent Rishis, Vasishtha, had been<br>engaged in his twilight adorations and seated as he was, he could not be<br>seen by us. We crossed him in ignorance. Therefore, in wrath he hath<br>cursed us, saying, Be ye born among men!' It is beyond our power to<br>frustrate what hath been said by that utterance of Brahma. Therefore, O<br>river, thyself becoming a human female make us the Vasus, thy children. O<br>amiable one, we are unwilling to enter the womb of any human female.'<br>Thus addressed, the queen of rivers told them, 'Be it so and asked them,<br>'On earth, who is that foremost of men whom ye will make your father?'<br><br>"The Vasus replied, 'On earth, unto Pratipa shall be born a son, Santanu,<br>who will be a king of world-wide fame.' Ganga then said, 'Ye celestials,<br>that is exactly my wish which ye sinless ones have expressed. I shall,<br>indeed, do good to that Santanu. That is also your desire as just<br>expressed.' The Vasus then said, 'It behoveth thee to throw thy children<br>after birth, into the water, so that, O thou of three courses (celestial,<br>terrestrial, and subterranean) we may be rescued soon without having to<br>live on earth for any length of time.' Ganga then answered, 'I shall do<br>what ye desire. But in order that his intercourse with me may not be<br>entirely fruitless, provide ye that one son at least may live.' The Vasus<br>then replied, 'We shall each contribute an eighth part of our respective<br>energies With the sum thereof, thou shall have one son according to thy<br>and his wishes. But this son shall not begat any children on earth.<br>Therefore, that son of thine endued with great energy, shall be<br>childless.'<br><br>"The Vasus, making this arrangement with Ganga, went away without Waiting<br>to the place they liked.'"
