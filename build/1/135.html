                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'When everyone had failed, Drona smilingly called<br>Arjuna and said unto him, 'By thee the aim must be shot; therefore, turn<br>thy eyes to it. Thou must let fly the arrow as soon as I give the order.<br>Therefore, O son, stand here with bow and arrow for an instant.' Thus<br>addressed, Arjuna stood aiming at the bird as desired by his preceptor,<br>with his bow bent. An instant after Drona asked him as in the case of<br>others, 'Seest thou, O Arjuna, the bird there, the tree, and myself?'<br>Arjuna replied, 'I see the bird only, but nor the tree, or thyself.' Then<br>the irrepressible Drona, well-pleased with Arjuna, the instant after,<br>again said unto that mighty car-warrior amongst the Pandavas, 'If thou<br>seest the vulture, then describe it to me.' Arjuna said, I see only the<br>head of the vulture, not its body.' At these words of Arjuna, the hair<br>(on Drona's body) stood on end from delight. He then said to Partha,<br>'Shoot.' And the latter instantly let fly (his arrow) and with his sharp<br>shaft speedily struck off the head of the vulture on the tree and brought<br>it down to the ground. No sooner was the deed done than Drona clasped<br>Phalguna to his bosom and thought Drupada with his friends had already<br>been vanquished in fight.<br><br>"Some time after, O bull of Bharata's race, Drona, accompanied by all of<br>his pupils, went to the bank of the Ganga to bathe in that sacred stream.<br>And when Drona had plunged into the stream, a strong alligator, sent as<br>it were, by Death himself seized him by the thigh. And though himself<br>quite capable, Drona in a seeming hurry asked his pupil to rescue him.<br>And he said, 'O, kill this monster and rescue me.' Contemporaneously with<br>this speech, Vibhatsu (Arjuna) struck the monster within the water with<br>five sharp arrows irresistible in their course, while the other pupils<br>stood confounded, each at his place. Beholding Arjuna's readiness, Drona<br>considered him to be the foremost of all his pupils, and became highly<br>pleased. The monster, in the meantime cut into pieces by the arrows of<br>Arjuna, released the thigh of illustrious Drona and gave up the ghost.<br>The son of Bharadwaja then addressed the illustrious and mighty<br>car-warrior Arjuna and said, 'Accept, O thou of mighty arms, this very<br>superior and irresistible weapon called Brahmasira with the methods of<br>hurling and recalling it. Thou must not, however, ever use it against any<br>human foe, for if hurled at any foe endued with inferior energy, it might<br>burn the whole universe. It is said, O child, that this weapon hath not a<br>peer in the three worlds. Keep it, therefore, with great care, and listen<br>to what I say. If ever, O hero, any foe, not human, contendeth against<br>thee thou mayst then employ it against him for compassing his death in<br>battle.' Pledging himself to do what he was bid, Vibhatsu then, with<br>joined hands, received that great weapon.<br><br>The preceptor then, addressing him again, said, 'None else in this world<br>will ever become a superior bowman to thee. Vanquished thou shall never<br>be by any foe, and thy achievements will be great.'"
