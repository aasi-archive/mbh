                            (Khandava-daha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then that Brahmana addressed Arjuna and Vasudeva of<br>the Satwata race, saying, 'Ye who are now staying so near unto Khandava<br>are the two foremost of heroes on earth. I am a voracious Brahmana that<br>always eateth much. O thou of the Vrishni race, and O Partha, I solicit<br>you to gratify me by giving me sufficient food.' Thus addressed by the<br>Brahmana, Krishna and the son of Pandu answered him, saying, 'O, tell us<br>what kind of food will gratify thee so that we may endeavour to give it<br>thee.' The illustrious Brahmana, thus replied to, said unto those heroes<br>who were enquiring after the kind of food he sought, 'I do not desire to<br>eat ordinary food. Know that I am Agni! Give me that food which suiteth<br>me. This forest of Khandava is always protected by Indra. And as it is<br>protected by the illustrious one, I always fail to consume it. In that<br>forest dwelleth, with his followers and family, a Naga, called Takshaka,<br>who is the friend of Indra. It is for him that the wielder of the<br>thunderbolt protecteth this forest. Many other creatures also are thus<br>protected here for the sake of Takshaka. Desiring to consume the forest I<br>succeed not in my attempts in consequence of Indra's prowess. Beholding<br>me blazing forth, he always poureth upon me water from the clouds.<br>Therefore, I succeed not in consuming the forest of Khandava, although I<br>desire very much to do so. I have now come to you&#8212;you who are both<br>skilled in weapons! If you help me I will surely consume this forest: for<br>even this is the food that is desired by me! As ye are conversant with<br>excellent weapons, I pray you to prevent those showers from descending<br>and any of the creatures from escaping, when I begin to consume this<br>forest!'<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'Why did the illustrious Agni desire to consume the<br>forest of Khandava that was filled with various living creatures and<br>protected by the chief of the celestials? When Agni consumed in wrath the<br>forest of Khandava, it is evident there was a grave cause. I desire, O<br>Brahmana, to hear all this in detail from thee. Tell me, O sage, how the<br>Khandava forest was consumed in days of yore.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'O chief of men, I will narrate to you the story of<br>the conflagration of Khandava as told by Rishis in the Purana. It hath<br>been heard, O king, in the Purana that there was a celebrated king of the<br>name of Swetaki who was endued with strength and prowess and who was<br>equal unto Indra himself. No one on earth has equalled him in sacrifices,<br>charity, and intelligence. Swetaki performed the five great sacrifices<br>and many others, at all of which the presents unto Brahmanas were large.<br>The heart of that monarch, O king, was always set upon sacrifices,<br>religious rites, and gifts of all kinds. And king Swetaki of great<br>intelligence, assisted by his Ritwiks performed sacrifices for many long<br>years, till those sacrificial priests with eyes afflicted by the<br>continued smoke and becoming very weak, left that monarch, wishing never<br>more to assist at his sacrifices. The king, however, repeatedly asked<br>those Ritwiks to come to him. But they came not to his sacrifice in<br>consequence of the painful state of their eyes. The king, therefore,<br>invited at the command of his own Ritwiks, others like unto them, and<br>completed the sacrifice that he had begun. After some days had elapsed,<br>king Swetaki desired to perform another sacrifice which should extend for<br>a hundred years. But the illustrious monarch obtained not any priest to<br>assist him in it. The celebrated king then, with his friends and<br>relatives, casting off all sloth, repeatedly courted his priests with<br>great persistence, by bowing down unto them, by conciliatory speeches,<br>and by gifts of wealth. All of them, however, refused to accomplish the<br>purpose which that king of immeasurable energy had in view. Then that<br>royal sage, getting angry, addressed those Brahmanas sitting in their<br>asylums, and said, 'If, ye Brahmanas, I were a fallen person, or, if, I<br>were wanting in homage and service to you, I should then deserve to be<br>abandoned without scruple by you and by other Brahmanas at the same time.<br>But as I am neither degraded nor wanting in homage to you, it behoveth<br>you not to obstruct the performance by me of my sacrifice or to abandon<br>me thus, ye foremost of Brahmanas, without adequate reason. I seek, ye<br>Brahmanas, your protection! It behoveth you to be propitious unto me.<br>But, ye foremost of Brahmanas, if you abandon me from enmity alone or any<br>improper motive, I shall go unto other priests for their assistance in<br>this sacrifice of mine, and conciliating them by sweet words and gifts, I<br>shall represent unto them the business I have on hand, so that they may<br>accomplish it.' Having said this, the monarch became silent. And, O<br>chastiser of foes, when those priests well knew that they could not<br>assist at the king's sacrifice, they pretended to be angry, and<br>addressing that best of monarchs said, 'O best of kings, thy sacrifices<br>are incessant! By assisting thee always, we have all been fatigued. And<br>as we have been wearied in consequence of these labours, it behoveth thee<br>to give us leave. O sinless one, from loss of judgment thou canst not<br>wait (but urgest us repeatedly). Go unto Rudra! He will assist at thy<br>sacrifice!' Hearing those words of censure and wrath, king Swetaki became<br>angry. And the monarch wending to the mountains of Kailasa, devoted<br>himself to asceticism there. And, O king, the monarch began to worship<br>Mahadeva, with fixed attention, and by observing the most rigid vows. And<br>foregoing all food at times, he passed a long period. The monarch ate<br>only fruits and roots sometimes at the twelfth and sometimes at the<br>sixteenth hour of the whole day. King Swetaki stood for six months, rapt<br>in attention, with arms upraised and steadfast eyes, like the trunk of a<br>tree or a column rooted to the ground. And, O Bharata, Sankara at last<br>gratified with that tiger among kings, who was undergoing such hard<br>penances, showed himself unto him. And the god spake unto the monarch in<br>a calm and grave voice, saying, 'O tiger among kings, O chastiser of<br>foes, I have been gratified with thee for thy asceticism! Blest be thou!<br>Ask now the boon that thou, O king, desirest.' Hearing these words of<br>Rudra of immeasurable energy, the royal sage bowed unto that deity and<br>replied, saying, 'O illustrious one, O thou that art worshipped by the<br>three worlds, if thou hast been gratified with me, then, O god of gods,<br>assist me thyself, O lord of the celestials, in my sacrifice!' Hearing<br>these words spoken by the monarch, the illustrious god was gratified, and<br>smilingly said, 'We do not ourselves assist at sacrifices: but as thou, O<br>king, hast undergone severe penances, desirous of obtaining a boon, I<br>will, O chastiser of foes, assist at thy sacrifice, upon, O king, this<br>condition.' And Rudra continued, 'If, O king of kings, thou canst, for<br>twelve years, pour without intermission libations of clarified butter<br>into the fire, thyself leading all the while the life of a Brahmacharin<br>with rapt attention, then thou shalt obtain from me what thou askest.'<br>King Swetaki, thus addressed by Rudra, did all that he was directed to do<br>by the wielder of the trident. And after twelve years had elapsed, he<br>again came unto Maheswara. And Sankara, the Creator of the worlds upon<br>seeing Swetaki, that excellent monarch, immediately said, in great<br>gratification, 'I have been gratified by thee, O best of kings, with this<br>thy own act! But, O chastiser of foes, the duty of assisting at<br>sacrifices properly belongeth to Brahmanas. Therefore, O oppressor of<br>foes, I will not myself assist at thy sacrifice today. There is on earth<br>an exalted Brahmana who is even a portion of my own self. He is known by<br>the name of Durvasa. Even that Brahmana endued with great energy will<br>assist you in thy sacrifice. Let, therefore, every preparation be made.'<br>Hearing these words uttered by Rudra, the king, returning to his own<br>capital, began to collect all that was necessary. After everything had<br>been collected, the monarch again presented himself before Rudra and<br>said, 'Every necessary article hath been collected, and all my<br>preparations are complete, through thy grace, O god of gods! Let me,<br>therefore, be installed at the sacrifice tomorrow.' Having heard these<br>words of that illustrious king, Rudra summoned Durvasa before him and<br>said. 'This, O Durvasa, is that best of monarchs called Swetaki. At my<br>command, O best of Brahmanas, assist even this king in his sacrifice.'<br>And the Rishi Durvasa said unto Rudra, 'So be it.' Then the sacrifice for<br>which king Swetaki had made those preparations, took place. And the<br>illustrious monarch's sacrifice was performed according to the ordinance<br>and in proper season. And the gifts, on that occasion, unto the Brahmanas<br>were large. And after that monarch's sacrifice had come to an end, all<br>the other priests who had come to assist at it went away with Durvasa's<br>leave. All other Sadasyas also of immeasurable energy, who had been<br>installed at that sacrifice, then went away. That exalted monarch then<br>entered his own palace, worshipped by exalted Brahmanas conversant with<br>the Vedas, eulogised by chanters of panegyrical hymns and congratulated<br>by the citizens.<br><br>"Such was the history of that best of monarchs, the royal sage Swetaki,<br>who, when the time came, ascended to heaven, having won great renown on<br>earth, and accompanied by the Ritwiks and the Sadasyas that had helped<br>him in life.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'At that sacrifice of Swetaki, Agni had drunk<br>clarified butter for twelve years. Indeed, clarified butter had been<br>poured into Agni's mouth in a continuous stream for that period. Having<br>drunk so much butter, Agni, satiated, desired not to drink butter again<br>from the hand of anybody else at any other sacrifice. Agni became pale,<br>having lost his colour, and he could not shine as before. He felt a loss<br>of appetite from surfeit, and his energy itself decreased and sickness<br>afflicted him. Then when the drinker of sacrificial libations perceived<br>that his energy was gradually diminishing, he went to the sacred abode of<br>Brahman that is worshipped by all. Approaching the great Deity seated on<br>his seat, Agni said, 'O exalted one, Swetaki hath (by his sacrifice)<br>gratified me to excess. Even now I am suffering from surfeit which I<br>cannot dispel. O Lord of the universe, I am being reduced both in<br>splendour and strength. I desire to regain, through thy grace, my own<br>permanent nature.' Hearing these words from Hutavaha, the illustrious<br>Creator of all things smilingly replied unto him, saying, 'O exalted one,<br>thou hast eaten, for twelve years, a continuous stream of sacrificial<br>butter poured into thy mouth! It is for this that illness hath seized<br>thee. But, O Agni, grieve not for it. Thou shalt soon regain thy own<br>nature. I shall dispel this surfeit of thine and the time for it is even<br>come. The dreadful forest Khandava, that abode of the enemies of the<br>gods, which thou hadst of old once consumed to ashes at the request of<br>the gods, hath now become the home of numerous creatures. When thou will<br>have eaten the fat of those creatures, thou shalt regain thy own nature.<br>Proceed thither in haste to consume that forest with its living<br>population. Thou wilt then be cured of thy malady.' Hearing the words<br>that fell from the lips of the Supreme Deity, Hutasana proceeded with<br>great speed and soon reached the forest of Khandava in great vigour.<br>Arrived there, he suddenly blazed forth in anger, assisted by Vayu.<br>Beholding Khandava on fire the dwellers (in the forest) that were there,<br>made great efforts to extinguish the conflagration. Elephants by hundreds<br>of thousands, speeding in anger, brought water in their trunks and<br>scattered it upon the fire. Thousands of many-hooded snakes, mad with<br>anger, hastily began to scatter upon fire much water from those many<br>hoods of theirs. And so, O bull of Bharata's race, the other creatures<br>dwelling in that forest, by various appliances and efforts, soon<br>extinguished the fire. In this way, Agni blazed forth in Khandava<br>repeatedly, even for seven times. And it was in this way that the blazing<br>fire was extinguished there as often by the denizens of that forest.'"
