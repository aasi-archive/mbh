                            (Viduragamana Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed by Duryodhana, Karna said, 'It doth<br>not seem to me, O Duryodhana, that thy reasoning is well-founded. O<br>perpetuator of the Kuru race, no method will succeed against the<br>Pandavas. O brave prince, thou hast before, by various subtle means,<br>striven to carry out thy wishes. But ever hast thou failed to slay thy<br>foes. They were then living near thee, O king! They were then unfledged<br>and of tender years, but thou couldst not injure them then. They are now<br>living at a distance, grown up, full-fledged. The sons of Kunti, O thou<br>of firm resolution, cannot now be injured by any subtle contrivances of<br>thine. This is my opinion. As they are aided by the very Fates, and as<br>they are desirous of regaining their ancestral kingdom, we can never<br>succeed in injuring them by any means in our power. It is impossible to<br>create disunion amongst them. They can never be disunited who have all<br>taken to a common wife. Nor can we succeed in estranging Krishna from the<br>Pandavas by any spies of ours. She chose them as her lords when they were<br>in adversity. Will she abandon them now that they are in prosperity?<br>Besides women always like to have many husbands, Krishna hath obtained<br>her wish. She can never be estranged from the Pandavas. The king of<br>Panchala is honest and virtuous; he is not avaricious. Even if we offer<br>him our whole kingdom he will not abandon the Pandavas. Drupada's son<br>also possesseth every accomplishment, and is attached to the Pandavas.<br>Therefore, I do not think that the Pandavas can now be injured by any<br>subtle means in thy power. But, O bull amongst men, this is what is good<br>and advisable for us now, viz., to attack and smite them till they are<br>exterminated. Let this course recommend itself to thee. As long as our<br>party is strong and that of the king of the Panchalas is weak, so long<br>strike them without any scruple. O son of Gandhari, as long as their<br>innumerable vehicles and animals, friends, and friendly tribes are not<br>mustered together, continue, O king, to exhibit thy prowess. As long as<br>the king of the Panchalas together with his sons gifted with great<br>prowess, setteth not his heart upon fighting with us, so long, O king,<br>exhibit thy prowess. And, O king, exert thy prowess before he of the<br>Vrishni race (Krishna) cometh with the Yadava host into the city of<br>Drupada, carrying everything before him, to restore the Pandavas to their<br>paternal kingdom. Wealth, every article of enjoyment, kingdom, there is<br>nothing that Krishna may not sacrifice for the sake of the Pandavas. The<br>illustrious Bharata had acquired the whole earth by his prowess alone.<br>Indra hath acquired sovereignty of the three worlds by prowess alone. O<br>king, prowess is always applauded by the Kshatriyas. O bull amongst<br>Kshatriyas, prowess is the cardinal virtue of the brave. Let us,<br>therefore, O monarch, with our large army consisting of four kinds of<br>forces, grind Drupada without loss of time, and bring hither the<br>Pandavas. Indeed, the Pandavas are incapable of being discomfited by any<br>policy of conciliation, of gift, of wealth and bribery, or of disunion.<br>Vanquish them, therefore, by thy prowess. And vanquishing them by thy<br>prowess, rule thou this wide earth. O monarch, I see not any other means<br>by which we may accomplish our end.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of Radheya, Dhritarashtra,<br>endued with great strength, applauded him highly. The monarch then<br>addressed him and said, 'Thou, O son of a Suta, art gifted with great<br>wisdom and accomplished in arms. This speech, therefore, favouring the<br>exhibition of prowess suiteth thee well. But let Bhishma, and Drona, and<br>Vidura, and you two, take counsel together and adopt that proposal which<br>may lead to our benefit.'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "'Then king Dhritarashtra called unto him, all<br>those celebrated ministers and took counsel with them.'"
