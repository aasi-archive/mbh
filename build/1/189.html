                            (Swayamvara Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then those youthful princes adorned with ear-rings,<br>vying with one another and each regarding himself accomplished in arms<br>and gifted with might, stood up brandishing their weapons. And<br>intoxicated with pride of beauty, prowess, lineage, knowledge, wealth,<br>and youth, they were like Himalayan elephants in the season of rut with<br>crowns split from excess of temporal juice. And beholding each other with<br>jealousy and influenced by the god of desire, they suddenly rose up from<br>their royal seats, exclaiming 'Krishna shall be mine.' And the Kshatriyas<br>assembled in that amphitheatre, each desirous of winning the daughter of<br>Drupada, looked like the celestial (of old) standing round Uma, the<br>daughter of the King of mountains. Afflicted with the shafts of the god<br>of the flowery bow and with hearts utterly lost in the contemplation of<br>Krishna, those princes descended into the amphitheatre for winning the<br>Panchala maiden and began to regard even their best friends with<br>jealousy. And there came also the celestials on their cars, with the<br>Rudras and the Adityas, the Vasus and the twin Aswins, the Swadhas and<br>all the Marutas, and Kuvera with Yama walking ahead. And there came also<br>the Daityas and the Suparnas, the great Nagas and the celestial Rishis,<br>the Guhyakas and the Charanas and Viswavasu and Narada and Parvata, and<br>the principal Gandharvas with Apsaras. And Halayudha (Valadeva) and<br>Janardana (Krishna) and the chief of the Vrishni, Andhaka, and Yadava<br>tribes who obeyed the leadership of Krishna were also there, viewing the<br>scene. And beholding those elephants in rut&#8212;the five<br>(Pandavas)&#8212;attracted towards Draupadi like mighty elephants towards a<br>lake overgrown with lotuses, or like fire covered with ashes, Krishna the<br>foremost of Yadu heroes began to reflect. And he said unto Rama<br>(Valadeva), 'That is Yudhishthira; that is Bhima with Jishnu (Arjuna);<br>and those are the twin heroes.' And Rama surveying them slowly cast a<br>glance of satisfaction at Krishna. Biting their nether lips in wrath, the<br>other heroes there&#8212;sons and grandsons of kings&#8212;with their eyes and<br>hearts and thoughts set on Krishna, looked with expanded eyes on Draupadi<br>alone without noticing the Pandavas. And the sons of Pritha also, of<br>mighty arms, and the illustrious twin heroes, beholding Draupadi, were<br>all likewise struck by the shafts of Kama. And crowded with celestial<br>Rishis and Gandharvas and Suparnas and Nagas and Asuras and Siddhas, and<br>filled with celestial perfumes and scattered over with celestial flowers,<br>and resounding with the kettle-drum and the deep hum of infinite voices,<br>and echoing with the softer music of the flute, the Vina, and the tabor,<br>the cars of the celestials could scarcely find a passage through the<br>firmament. Then those princes&#8212;Karna, Duryodhana, Salwa, Salya,<br>Aswatthaman, Kratha, Sunitha, Vakra, the ruler of Kalinga and Banga,<br>Pandya, Paundra, the ruler of Videha, the chief of the Yavanas, and many<br>other sons and grandsons of kings,&#8212;sovereigns of territories with eyes<br>like lotus-petals,&#8212;one after another began to exhibit prowess for<br>(winning) that maiden of unrivalled beauty. Adorned with crowns,<br>garlands, bracelets, and other ornaments, endued with mighty arms,<br>possessed of prowess and vigour and bursting with strength and energy,<br>those princes could not, even in imagination, string that bow of<br>extraordinary stiffness.<br><br>"And (some amongst) those kings in exerting with swelling lips each<br>according to his strength, education, skill, and energy,&#8212;to string that<br>bow, were tossed on the ground and lay perfectly motionless for some<br>time. Their strength spent and their crowns and garlands loosened from<br>their persons, they began to pant for breath and their ambition of<br>winning that fair maiden was cooled. Tossed by that tough bow, and their<br>garlands and bracelets and other ornaments disordered, they began to<br>utter exclamations of woe. And that assemblage of monarchs, their hope of<br>obtaining Krishna gone, looked sad and woeful. And beholding the plight<br>of those monarchs, Karna that foremost of all wielders of the bow went to<br>where the bow was, and quickly raising it strung it and placed the arrows<br>on the string. And beholding the son of Surya&#8212;Karna of the Suta<br>tribe&#8212;like unto fire, or Soma, or Surya himself, resolved to shoot the<br>mark, those foremost of bowmen&#8212;the sons of Pandu&#8212;regarded the mark as<br>already shot and brought down upon the ground. But seeing Karna, Draupadi<br>loudly said, 'I will not select a Suta for my lord.' Then Karna, laughing<br>in vexation and casting glance at the Sun, threw aside the bow already<br>drawn to a circle.<br><br>Then when all those Kshatriyas gave up the task, the heroic king of the<br>Chedis&#8212;mighty as Yama (Pluto) himself&#8212;the illustrious and determined<br>Sisupala, the son of Damaghosa, in endeavouring to string the bow,<br>himself fell upon his knees on the ground. Then king Jarasandha endued<br>with great strength and powers, approaching the bow stood there for some<br>moment, fixed and motionless like a mountain. Tossed by the bow, he too<br>fell upon his knees on the ground, and rising up, the monarch left the<br>amphitheatre for (returning to) his kingdom. Then the great hero Salya,<br>the king of Madra, endued with great strength, in endeavouring to string<br>the bow fell upon his knees on the ground. At last when in that<br>assemblage consisting of highly respectable people, all the monarchs had<br>become subjects of derisive talk that foremost of heroes&#8212;Jishnu, the son<br>of Kunti&#8212;desired to string the bow and placed the arrows on the<br>bow-string.'"
