                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Alter this Indra again asked Yayati, 'Thou didst<br>retire into the woods, O king, after accomplishing all thy duties. O<br>Yayati, son of Nahusha, I would ask thee to whom thou art equal in<br>ascetic austerities.' Yayati answered, 'O Vasava, I do not, in the matter<br>of ascetic austerities, behold my equal among men, the celestials, the<br>Gandharvas, and the great Rishis.' Indra then said, 'O monarch, because<br>thou disregardest those that are thy superiors, thy equals, and even thy<br>inferiors, without, in fact, knowing their real merits, thy virtues have<br>suffered diminution and thou must fall from heaven.' Yayati then said, 'O<br>Sakra, if, indeed, my virtues have really sustained diminution and I must<br>on that account fall down from heaven, I desire, O chief of the<br>celestials, that I may at least fall among the virtuous and the honest.'<br>Indra replied, 'O king, thou shall fall among those that are virtuous and<br>wise, and thou shall acquire also much renown. And after this experience<br>of thine, O Yayati, never again disregard those that are thy superiors or<br>even thy equals.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Upon this, Yayati fell from the region of the<br>celestials. And as he was falling, he was beheld by that foremost of<br>royal sages, viz., Ashtaka, the protector of his own religion. Ashtaka<br>beholding him, enquired, 'Who art thou, O youth of a beauty equal to that<br>of Indra, in splendour blazing as the fire, thus falling from on high?<br>Art thou that foremost of sky-ranging bodies&#8212;the sun&#8212;emerging from,<br>dark masses of clouds? Beholding thee falling from the solar course,<br>possessed of immeasurable energy and the splendour of fire or the sun,<br>every one is curious as to what it is that is so falling, and is,<br>besides, deprived of consciousness! Beholding thee in the path of the<br>celestials, possessed of energy like that of Sakra, or Surya, or Vishnu,<br>we have approached thee to ascertain the truth. If thou hast first asked<br>us who we were, we would never have been guilty of the incivility of<br>asking thee first. We now ask thee who thou art and why thou approachest<br>hither. Let thy fears be dispelled; let thy woes and afflictions cease.<br>Thou art now in the presence of the virtuous and the wise. Even Sakra<br>himself&#8212;the slayer of Vala&#8212;cannot here do thee any injury. O thou of<br>the prowess of the chief of the celestials, the wise and the virtuous are<br>the support of their brethren in grief. Here there are none but the wise<br>and virtuous like thee assembled together. Therefore, stay thou here in<br>peace. Fire alone hath power to give heat. The Earth alone hath power to<br>infuse life into the seed. The sun alone hath power to illuminate<br>everything. So the guest alone hath power to command the virtuous and the<br>wise.'"
