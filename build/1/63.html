                            (Adivansavatarana Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'There was a king of the name of Uparichara. That<br>monarch was devoted to virtue. He was very much addicted also to hunting.<br>That king of the Paurava race, called also Vasu, conquered the excellent<br>and delightful kingdom of Chedi under instructions from Indra. Some time<br>after, the king gave up the use of arms and, dwelling in a secluded<br>retreat, practised the most severe austerities. The gods with Indra at<br>their head once approached the monarch during this period, believing that<br>he sought the headship of the gods, by those severe austerities of his.<br>The celestials, becoming objects of his sight, by soft speeches succeeded<br>in winning him away from his ascetic austerities.'<br><br>"The gods said, 'O lord of the earth, thou shouldst take care so that<br>virtue may not sustain a diminution on earth! Protected by thee, virtue<br>itself will in return protect the universe.' And Indra said, 'O king,<br>protect virtue on earth attentively and rigidly. Being virtuous, thou<br>shalt, for all time, behold (in after life) many sacred regions. And<br>though I am of Heaven, and thou art of earth, yet art thou my friend and<br>dear to me. And, O king of men, dwell thou in that region on earth which<br>is delightful, and aboundeth in animals, is sacred, full of wealth and<br>corn, is well-protected like heaven, which is of agreeable climate,<br>graced with every object of enjoyment, and blessed with fertility. And, O<br>monarch of Chedi, this thy dominion is full of riches, of gems and<br>precious stones, and containeth, besides, much mineral wealth. The cities<br>and towns of this region are all devoted to virtue; the people are honest<br>and contented; they never lie even in jest. Sons never divide their<br>wealth with their fathers and are ever mindful of the welfare of their<br>parents. Lean cattle are never yoked to the plough or the cart or engaged<br>in carrying merchandise; on the other hand, they are well-fed and<br>fattened. In Chedi the four orders are always engaged in their respective<br>vocations. Let nothing be unknown to thee that happens in the three<br>worlds. I shall give thee a crystal car such as the celestials alone are<br>capable of carrying the car through mid air. Thou alone, of all mortals<br>on earth, riding on that best of cars, shall course through mid-air like<br>a celestial endued with a physical frame. I shall also give thee a<br>triumphal garland of unfading lotuses, with which on, in battle, thou<br>shall not be wounded by weapons. And, O king, this blessed and<br>incomparable garland, widely known on earth as Indra's garland, shall be<br>thy distinctive badge.<br><br>"The slayer of Vritra (Indra) also gave the king, for his gratification,<br>a bamboo pole for protecting the honest and the peaceful. After the<br>expiry of a year, the king planted it in the ground for the purpose of<br>worshipping the giver thereof, viz., Sakra. From that time forth, O<br>monarch, all kings, following Vasu's example, began to plant a pole for<br>the celebration of Indra's worship. After erecting the pole they decked<br>it with golden cloth and scents and garlands and various ornaments. And<br>the god Vasava is worshipped in due form with such garlands and<br>ornaments. And the god, for the gratification of the illustrious Vasu,<br>assuming the form of a swan, came himself to accept the worship thus<br>offered. And the god, beholding the auspicious worship thus made by Vasu,<br>that first of monarchs, was delighted, and said unto him, 'Those men, and<br>kings also, who will worship me and joyously observe this festival of<br>mine like the king of Chedi, shall have glory and victory for their<br>countries and kingdom. Their cities also shall expand and be ever in<br>joy.'<br><br>"King Vasu was thus blessed by the gratified Maghavat, the high-souled<br>chief of the gods. Indeed, those men who cause this festivity of Sakra to<br>be observed with gifts of land, of gems and precious stones, become the<br>respected of the world. And king Vasu, the lord of Chedis bestowing boons<br>and performing great sacrifices and observing the festivity of Sakra, was<br>much respected by Indra. And from Chedi he ruled the whole world<br>virtuously. And for the gratification of Indra, Vasu, the lord of the<br>Chedis, observed the festivity of Indra.<br><br>"And Vasu had five sons of great energy and immeasurable prowess. And the<br>emperor installed his sons as governors of various provinces.<br><br>"And his son Vrihadratha was installed in Magadha and was known by the<br>name of Maharatha. Another son of his was Pratyagraha; and another,<br>Kusamva, who was also called Manivahana. And the two others were Mavella,<br>and Yadu of great prowess and invincible in battle.<br><br>"These, O monarch, were the sons of that royal sage of mighty energy. And<br>the five sons of Vasu planted kingdoms and towns after their own names<br>and founded separate dynasties that lasted for long ages.<br><br>"And when king Vasu took his seat in that crystal car, with the gift of<br>Indra, and coursed through the sky, he was approached by Gandharvas and<br>Apsaras (the celestial singers and dancers). And as he coursed through<br>the upper regions, he was called Uparichara. And by his capital flowed a<br>river called Suktimati. And that river was once attacked by a life-endued<br>mountain called Kolahala maddened by lust. And Vasu, beholding the foul<br>attempt, struck the mountain with his foot. And by the indentation caused<br>by Vasu's stamp, the river came out (of the embraces of Kolahala). But<br>the mountain begat on the river two children that were twins. And the<br>river, grateful to Vasu for his having set her free from Kolahala's<br>embraces, gave them both to Vasu. And the son was made the generalissimo<br>to his forces by Vasu, that best of royal sages and giver of wealth and<br>punisher of enemies. And the daughter called Girika, was wedded by Vasu.<br><br>'And Girika, the wife of Vasu, after her menstrual course, purifying<br>herself by a bath, represented her state unto her lord. But that very day<br>the Pitris of Vasu came unto that best of monarchs and foremost of wise<br>men, and asked him to slay deer (for their Sraddha). And the king,<br>thinking that the command of the Pitris should not be disobeyed, went<br>a-hunting thinking of Girika alone who was gifted with great beauty and<br>like unto another Sri herself. And the season being the spring, the woods<br>within which the king was roaming, had become delightful like unto the<br>gardens of the king of the Gandharvas himself. There were Asokas and<br>Champakas and Chutas and Atimuktas in abundance: and there were Punnagas<br>and Karnikaras and Vakulas and Divya Patalas and Patalas and Narikelas<br>and Chandanas and Arjunas and similar other beautiful and sacred trees<br>resplendent with fragrant flowers and sweet fruits. And the whole forest<br>was maddened by the sweet notes of the kokila and echoed with the hum of<br>maddened bees. And the king became possessed with desire, and he saw not<br>his wife before him. Maddened by desire he was roaming hither and<br>thither, when he saw a beautiful Asoka decked with dense foliage, its<br>branches covered with flowers. And the king sat at his ease in the shade<br>of that tree. And excited by the fragrance of the season and the charming<br>odours of the flowers around, and excited also by the delicious breeze,<br>the king could not keep his mind away from the thought of the beautiful<br>Girika. And beholding that a swift hawk was resting very near to him, the<br>king, acquainted with the subtle truths of Dharma and Artha, went unto<br>him and said, 'Amiable one, carry thou this seed (semen) for my wife<br>Girika and give it unto her. Her season hath arrived.'<br><br>"The hawk, swift of speed, took it from the king and rapidly coursed<br>through the air. While thus passing, the hawk was seen by another of his<br>species. Thinking that the first one was carrying meat, the second one<br>flew at him. The two fought with each other in the sky with their beaks.<br>While they were fighting, the seed fell into the waters of the Yamuna.<br>And in those waters dwelt an Apsara of the higher rank, known by the name<br>of Adrika, transformed by a Brahmana's curse into a fish. As soon as<br>Vasu's seed fell into the water from the claws of the hawk, Adrika<br>rapidly approached and swallowed it at once. That fish was, some time<br>after, caught by the fishermen. And it was the tenth month of the fish's<br>having swallowed the seed. From the stomach of that fish came out a male<br>and a female child of human form. The fishermen wondered much, and<br>wending unto king Uparichara (for they were his subjects) told him all.<br>They said, 'O king, these two beings of human shape have been found in<br>the body of a fish!' The male child amongst the two was taken by<br>Uparichara. That child afterwards became the virtuous and truthful<br>monarch Matsya.<br><br>"After the birth of the twins, the Apsara herself became freed from her<br>curse. For she had been told before by the illustrious one (who had<br>cursed her) that she would, while living in her piscatorial form, give<br>birth to two children of human shape and then would be freed from the<br>curse. Then, according to these words, having given birth to the two<br>children, and been killed by the fishermen, she left her fish-form and<br>assumed her own celestial shape. The Apsara then rose up on the path<br>trodden by the Siddhas, the Rishis and the Charanas.<br><br>"The fish-smelling daughter of the Apsara in her piscatorial form was<br>then given by the king unto the fishermen, saying, 'Let this one be thy<br>daughter.' That girl was known by the name of Satyavati. And gifted with<br>great beauty and possessed of every virtue, she of agreeable smiles,<br>owing to contact with fishermen, was for some time of the fishy smell.<br>Wishing to serve her (foster) father she plied a boat on the waters of<br>the Yamuna.<br><br>"While engaged in this vocation, Satyavati was seen one day by the great<br>Rishi Parasara, in course of his wanderings. As she was gifted with great<br>beauty, an object of desire even with an anchorite, and of graceful<br>smiles, the wise sage, as soon as he beheld her, desired to have her. And<br>that bull amongst Munis addressed the daughter of Vasu of celestial<br>beauty and tapering thighs, saying, 'Accept my embraces, O blessed one!'<br>Satyavati replied, 'O holy one, behold the Rishis standing on either bank<br>of the river. Seen by them, how can I grant thy wish?'<br><br>"Thus addressed by her, the ascetic thereupon created a fog (which<br>existed not before and) which enveloped the whole region in darkness. And<br>the maiden, beholding the fog that was created by the great Rishi<br>wondered much. And the helpless one became suffused with the blushes of<br>bashfulness. And she said, 'O holy one, note that I am a maiden under the<br>control of my father. O sinless one, by accepting your embraces my<br>virginity will be sullied. O best of Brahmanas, my virginity being<br>sullied, how shall I, O Rishi, be able to return home? Indeed, I shall<br>not then be able to bear life. Reflecting upon all this, O illustrious<br>one, do that which should be done.' That best of Rishis, gratified with<br>all she said, replied, "Thou shall remain a virgin even if thou grantest<br>my wish. And, O timid one, O beauteous lady, solicit the boon that thou<br>desirest. O thou of fair smiles, my grace hath never before proved<br>fruitless.' Thus addressed, the maiden asked for the boon that her body<br>might emit a sweet scent (instead of the fish-odour that it had). And the<br>illustrious Rishi thereupon granted that wish of her heart.<br><br>"Having obtained her boon, she became highly pleased, and her season<br>immediately came. And she accepted the embraces of that Rishi of<br>wonderful deeds. And she thenceforth became known among men by the name<br>of Gandhavati (the sweet-scented one). And men could perceive her scent<br>from the distance of a yojana. And for this she was known by another name<br>which was Yojanagandha (one who scatters her scent for a yojana all<br>around). And the illustrious Parasara, after this, went to his own asylum.<br><br>"And Satyavati gratified with having obtained the excellent boon in<br>consequence of which she became sweet-scented and her virginity remained<br>unsullied conceived through Parasara's embraces. And she brought forth<br>the very day, on an island in the Yamuna, the child begot upon her by<br>Parasara and gifted with great energy. And the child, with the permission<br>of his mother, set his mind on asceticism. And he went away saying, 'As<br>soon as thou rememberest me when occasion comes, I shall appear unto<br>thee.'<br><br>"And it was thus that Vyasa was born of Satyavati through Parasara. And<br>because he was born in an island, he was called Dwaipayana (Dwaipa or<br>islandborn). And the learned Dwaipayana, beholding that virtue is<br>destined to become lame by one leg each yuga (she having four legs in<br>all) and that the period of life and the strength of men followed the<br>yugas, and moved by the desire of obtaining the favour of Brahman and the<br>Brahmanas, arranged the Vedas. And for this he came to be called Vyasa<br>(the arranger or compiler). The boon-giving great one then taught<br>Sumanta, Jaimini, Paila, his son Suka, and Vaisampayana, the Vedas having<br>the Mahabharata for their fifth. And the compilation of the Bharata was<br>published by him through them separately.<br><br>"Then Bhishma, of great energy and fame and of immeasurable splendour,<br>and sprung from the component parts of the Vasus, was born in the womb of<br>Ganga through king Santanu. And there was a Rishi of the name of<br>Animandavya of great fame. And he was conversant with the interpretations<br>of the Vedas, was illustrious, gifted with great energy, and of great<br>reputation. And, accused of theft, though innocent, the old Rishi was<br>impaled. He thereupon summoned Dharma and told him these words, 'In my<br>childhood I had pierced a little fly on a blade of grass, O Dharma! I<br>recollect that one sin: but I cannot call to mind any other. I have,<br>however, since practised penances a thousandfold. Hath not that one sin<br>been conquered by this my asceticism? And because the killing of a<br>Brahmana is more heinous than that of any other living thing, therefore,<br>hast thou, O Dharma, been sinful. Thou shalt, therefore, be born on earth<br>in the Sudra order.' And for that curse Dharma was born a Sudra in the<br>form of the learned Vidura of pure body who was perfectly sinless. And<br>the Suta was born of Kunti in her maidenhood through Surya. And he came<br>out of his mother's womb with a natural coat of mail and face brightened<br>by ear-rings. And Vishnu himself, of world-wide fame, and worshipped of<br>all the worlds, was born of Devaki through Vasudeva, for the benefit of<br>the three worlds. He is without birth and death, of radiant splendour,<br>the Creator of the universe and the Lord of all! Indeed, he who is the<br>invisible cause of all, who knoweth no deterioration, who is the<br>all-pervading soul, the centre round which everything moveth, the<br>substance in which the three attributes of Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas<br>co-inhere, the universal soul, the immutable, the material out of which<br>hath been created this universe, the Creator himself, the controlling<br>lord, the invisible dweller in every object, progenitor of this universe<br>of five elements, who is united with the six high attributes, is the<br>Pranava or Om of the Vedas, is infinite, incapable of being moved by any<br>force save his own will, illustrious, the embodiment of the mode of life<br>called Sannyasa, who floated on the waters before the creation, who is<br>the source whence hath sprung this mighty frame, who is the great<br>combiner, the uncreate, the invisible essence of all, the great<br>immutable, bereft of those attributes that are knowable by the senses,<br>who is the universe itself, without beginning, birth, and decay,&#8212;is<br>possessed of infinite wealth, that Grandsire of all creatures, became<br>incarnate in the race of the Andhaka-Vrishnis for the increase of virtue.<br><br>"And Satyaki and Kritavarma, conversant with (the use of) weapons<br>possessed of mighty energy, well-versed in all branches of knowledge, and<br>obedient to Narayana in everything and competent in the use of weapons,<br>had their births from Satyaka and Hridika. And the seed of the great<br>Rishi Bharadwaja of severe penances, kept in a pot, began to develop. And<br>from that seed came Drona (the pot-born). And from the seed of Gautama,<br>fallen upon a clump of reeds, were born two that were twins, the mother<br>of Aswatthaman (called Kripi), and Kripa of great strength. Then was born<br>Dhrishtadyumna, of the splendour of Agni himself, from the sacrificial<br>fire. And the mighty hero was born with bow in hand for the destruction<br>of Drona. And from the sacrificial altar was born Krishna (Draupadi)<br>resplendent and handsome, of bright features and excellent beauty. Then<br>was born the disciple of Prahlada, viz., Nagnajit, and also Suvala. And<br>from Suvala was born a son, Sakuni, who from the curse of the gods became<br>the slayer of creatures and the foe of virtue. And unto him was also born<br>a daughter (Gandhari), the mother of Duryodhana. And both were<br>well-versed in the arts of acquiring worldly profits. And from Krishna<br>was born, in the soil of Vichitravirya, Dhritarashtra, the lord of men,<br>and Pandu of great strength. And from Dwaipayana also born, in the Sudra<br>caste, the wise and intelligent Vidura, conversant with both religion and<br>profit, and free from all sins. And unto Pandu by his two wives were born<br>five sons like the celestials. The eldest of them was Yudhishthira. And<br>Yudhishthira was born (of the seed) of Dharma (Yama, the god of justice);<br>and Bhima of the wolf's stomach was born of Marut (the god of wind), and<br>Dhananjaya, blessed with good fortune and the first of all wielders of<br>weapons, was born of Indra; and Nakula and Sahadeva, of handsome features<br>and ever engaged in the service of their superiors, were born of the twin<br>Aswins. And unto the wise Dhritarashtra were born a hundred sons, viz.,<br>Duryodhana and others, and another, named Yuyutsu, who was born of a<br>vaisya woman. And amongst those hundred and one, eleven, viz., Duhsasana,<br>Duhsaha, Durmarshana, Vikarna, Chitrasena, Vivinsati, Jaya, Satyavrata,<br>Purumitra, and Yuyutsu by a Vaisya wife, were all Maharathas (great<br>car-warriors). And Abhimanyu was born of Subhadra, the sister of Vasudeva<br>through Arjuna, and was, therefore, the grandson of the illustrious<br>Pandu. And unto the five Pandavas were born five sons by (their common<br>wife) Panchali. And these princes were all very handsome and conversant<br>with all branches of knowledge. From Yudhishthira was born Pritivindhya;<br>from Vrikodara, Sutasoma; from Arjuna, Srutakirti; from Nakula, Satanika;<br>and from Sahadeva, Srutasena of great prowess; and Bhima, in the forest<br>begot on Hidimva a son named Ghatotkacha. And from Drupada was born a<br>daughter Sikhandin who was afterwards transformed into a male child.<br>Sikhandini was so transformed into a male by Yaksha named Sthuna from the<br>desire of doing her good.<br><br>"In that great battle of the Kurus came hundreds of thousands of monarchs<br>for fighting against one another. The names of the innumerable host I am<br>unable to recount even in ten thousand years. I have named, however, the<br>principal ones who have been mentioned in this history.'"
