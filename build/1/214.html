                            (Rajya-labha Parva continued)<br><br>"Narada continued, 'Meanwhile the Asura brothers having subjugated the<br>earth were without a rival. The fatigue of exertion gone, they, having<br>brought the three worlds under equal sway, regarded themselves as persons<br>that had nothing more to do. Having brought all the treasures of the<br>gods, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the Nagas, the Rakshasas, and the<br>kings of the earth, the brothers began to pass their days in great<br>happiness. When they saw they had no rivals (in the three worlds), they<br>gave up all exertion and devoted their time to pleasure and merriment,<br>like the celestials. They experienced great happiness by giving<br>themselves up to every kind of enjoyment, such as women, and perfumes and<br>floral wreaths and viands, and drinks and many other agreeable objects<br>all in profusion. In houses and woods and gardens, on hills and in<br>forests, wherever they liked they passed their time in pleasure and<br>amusement, like the immortals. And it so happened that one day they went<br>for purposes of pleasure to a tableland of the Vindhya range, perfectly<br>level and stony, and overgrown with blossoming trees. After every object<br>of desire, all of the most agreeable kind, had been brought, the brothers<br>sat on an excellent seat, with happy hearts and accompanied by handsome<br>women. And those damsels, desirous of pleasing the brothers, commenced a<br>dance in accompaniment to music, and sweetly chanted many a song in<br>praise of the mighty pair.'<br><br>"Meanwhile Tilottama attired in a single piece of red silk that exposed<br>all her charms, came along, plucking wild flowers on her way. She<br>advanced slowly to where those mighty Asuras were. The Asura brothers,<br>intoxicated with the large portions they had imbibed, were smitten upon<br>beholding that maiden of transcendent beauty. Leaving their seats they<br>went quickly to where the damsel was. Both of them being under the<br>influence of lust, each sought the maiden for himself. And Sunda seized<br>that maid of fair brows by her right hand. Intoxicated with the boons<br>they had obtained, with physical might, with the wealth and gems they had<br>gathered from every quarter, and with the wine they had drunk, maddened<br>with all these, and influenced by wishful desire, they addressed each<br>other, each contracting his bow in anger, 'She is my wife, and therefore<br>your superior,' said Sunda. 'She is my wife, and therefore your<br>sister-in-law', replied Upasunda. And they said unto each other, 'She is<br>mine not yours.' And soon they were under the influence of rage. Maddened<br>by the beauty of the damsel, they soon forgot their love and affection<br>for each other. Both of them, deprived of reason by passion, then took up<br>their fierce maces. Each repeating, I was the first, I was the first,'<br>(in taking her hand) struck the other. And the fierce Asuras, struck by<br>each other with the mace, fell down upon the ground, their bodies bathed<br>in blood, like two suns dislodged from the firmament. And beholding this,<br>the women that had come there, and the other Asuras there present, all<br>fled away trembling in grief and fear, and took refuge in the nether<br>regions. The Grandsire himself of pure soul, then came there, accompanied<br>by the celestials, and the great Rishis. And the illustrious Grandsire<br>applauded Tilottama and expressed his wish of granting her a boon. The<br>Supreme Deity, before Tilottama spoke, desirous of granting her a boon,<br>cheerfully said, 'O beautiful damsel, thou shalt roam in the region of<br>the Adityas. Thy splendour shall be so great that nobody will ever be<br>able to look at thee for any length of time!' The Grandsire of all<br>creatures, granting this boon unto her, establishing the three worlds in<br>Indra as before, returned to his own region.'<br><br>"Narada continued, 'It was thus that Asuras, ever united and inspired by<br>the same purpose slew each other in wrath for the sake of Tilottama.<br>Therefore, from affection I tell you, ye foremost ones of Bharata's line,<br>that if you desire to do anything agreeable to me, make some such<br>arrangements that you may not quarrel with one another for the sake of<br>Draupadi.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The illustrious Pandavas, thus addressed by the<br>great Rishi Narada, consulting with one another, established a rule<br>amongst themselves in the presence of the celestial Rishi himself endued<br>with immeasurable energy. And the rule they made was that when one of<br>them would be sitting with Draupadi, any of the other four who would see<br>that one thus must retire into the forest for twelve years, passing his<br>days as a Brahmacharin. After the virtuous Pandavas had established that<br>rule amongst themselves, the great Muni Narada, gratified with them, went<br>to the place he wished. Thus, O Janamejaya, did the Pandavas urged by<br>Narada, established a rule amongst themselves in regard to their common<br>wife. And it was for this, O Bharata, that no dispute ever arose between<br>them.'"
