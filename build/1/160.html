                            (Vaka-vadha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, "On hearing these words of the Brahmana, his wife<br>said, 'Thou shouldst not, O Brahmana, grieve like an ordinary man. Nor is<br>this the time for mourning. Thou hast learning; thou knowest that all men<br>are sure to die; none should grieve for that which is inevitable. Wife,<br>son, and daughter, all these are sought for one's own self. As thou art<br>possessed of a good understanding, kill thou thy sorrows. I will myself<br>go there. This indeed, is the highest and the eternal duty of a woman,<br>viz., that by sacrificing her life she should seek the good of her<br>husband. Such an act done by me will make thee happy, and bring me fame<br>in this world and eternal bliss hereafter. This, indeed, is the highest<br>virtue that I tell thee, and thou mayest, by this, acquire both virtue<br>and happiness. The object for which one desireth a wife hath already been<br>achieved by thee through me. I have borne thee a daughter and a son and<br>thus been freed from the debt I had owed thee. Thou art well able to<br>support and cherish the children, but I however, can never support and<br>cherish them like thee. Thou art my life, wealth, and lord; bereft of<br>thee, how shall these children of tender years&#8212;how also shall I myself,<br>exist? Widowed and masterless, with two children depending on me, how<br>shall I, without thee, keep alive the pair, myself leading an honest<br>life? If the daughter of thine is solicited (in marriage) by persons<br>dishonourable and vain and unworthy of contracting an alliance with thee,<br>how shall I be able to protect the girl? Indeed, as birds seek with<br>avidity for meat that hath been thrown away on the ground, so do men<br>solicit a woman that hath lost her husband. O best of Brahmanas,<br>solicited by wicked men, I may waver and may not be able to continue in<br>the path that is desired by all honest men. How shall I be able to place<br>this sole daughter of thy house&#8212;this innocent girl&#8212;in the way along<br>which her ancestors have always walked? How shall I then be able to<br>impart unto this child every desirable accomplishment to make him<br>virtuous as thyself, in that season of want when I shall become<br>masterless? Overpowering myself who shall be masterless, unworthy persons<br>will demand (the hand of) this daughter of thine, like Sudras desiring to<br>hear the Vedas. And if I bestow not upon them this girl possessing thy<br>blood and qualities, they may even take her away by force, like crows<br>carrying away the sacrificial butter. And beholding thy son become so<br>unlike to thee, and thy daughter placed under the control of some<br>unworthy persons, I shall be despised in the world by even persons that<br>are dishonourable, and I will certainly die. These children also, bereft<br>of me and thee, their father, will, I doubt not, perish like fish when<br>the water drieth up. There is no doubt that bereft of thee the three will<br>perish: therefore it behoveth thee to sacrifice me. O Brahmana, persons<br>conversant with morals have said that for women that have borne children,<br>to predecease their lords is an act of the highest merit. Ready am I to<br>abandon this son and this daughter, these my relations, and life itself,<br>for thee. For a woman to be ever employed in doing agreeable offices to<br>her lord is a higher duty than sacrifices, asceticism, vows, and<br>charities of every description. The act, therefore, which I intend to<br>perform is consonant with the highest virtue and is for thy good and that<br>of thy race. The wise have declared that children and relatives and wife<br>and all things held dear are cherished for the purpose of liberating<br>one's self from danger and distress. One must guard one's wealth for<br>freeing one's self from danger, and it is by his wealth that he should<br>cherish and protect his wife. But he must protect his own self both by<br>(means of) his wife and his wealth. The learned have enunciated the truth<br>that one's wife, son, wealth, and house, are acquired with the intention<br>of providing against accidents, foreseen or unforeseen. The wise have<br>also said that all one's relations weighed against one's own self would<br>not be equal unto one's self. Therefore, revered sir, protect thy own<br>self by abandoning me. O, give me leave to sacrifice myself, and cherish<br>thou my children. Those that are conversant with the morals have, in<br>their treatises, said, that women should never be slaughtered and that<br>Rakshasas are not ignorant of the rules of morality. Therefore, while it<br>is certain that the Rakshasa will kill a man, it is doubtful whether he<br>will kill a woman. It behoveth thee, therefore, being conversant with the<br>rules of morality, to place me before the Rakshasa. I have enjoyed much<br>happiness, have obtained much that is agreeable to me, and have also<br>acquired great religious merit. I have also obtained from thee children<br>that are so dear to me. Therefore, it grieveth not me to die. I have<br>borne thee children and have also grown old; I am ever desirous of doing<br>good to thee; remembering all these I have come to this resolution. O<br>revered sir, abandoning me thou mayest obtain another wife. By her thou<br>mayest again acquire religious merit. There is no sin in this. For a man<br>polygamy is an act of merit, but for a woman it is very sinful to betake<br>herself to a second husband after the first. Considering all this, and<br>remembering too that sacrifice of thy own self is censurable, O, liberate<br>today without loss of time thy own self, thy race, and these thy children<br>(by abandoning me).'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by her, O Bharata, the Brahmana<br>embraced her, and they both began to weep in silence, afflicted with<br>grief.'"
