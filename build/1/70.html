                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then the king with his followers, having killed<br>thousands of animals, entered another forest with a view to hunting. And<br>attended by a single follower and fatigued with hunger and thirst, he<br>came upon a large desert on the frontiers of the forest. And having<br>crossed this herbless plain, the king came upon another forest full of<br>the retreats of ascetics, beautiful to look at, delightful to the heart<br>and of cool agreeable breezes. And it was full of trees covered with<br>blossoms, the soil overgrown with the softest and greenest grass,<br>extending for many miles around, and echoing with the sweet notes of<br>winged warblers. And it resounded with the notes of the male Kokila and<br>of the shrill cicala. And it was full of magnificent trees with<br>outstretched branches forming a shady canopy overhead. And the bees<br>hovered over flowery creepers all around. And there were beautiful bowers<br>in every place. And there was no tree without fruits, none that had<br>prickles on it, none that had no bees swarming around it. And the whole<br>forest resounded with the melody of winged choristers. And it was decked<br>with the flowers of every season. And there were refreshing shades of<br>blossoming trees.<br><br>"Such was the delicious and excellent forest that the great bowman<br>entered. And trees with branches beautified with clusters began to wave<br>gently at the soft breeze and rain their flowers over the monarch's head.<br>And the trees, clad in their flowery attires of all colours, with<br>sweet-throated warblers perched on them, stood there in rows with heads<br>touching the very heavens. And around their branches hanging down with<br>the weight of flowers the bees tempted by the honey hummed in sweet<br>chorus. And the king, endued with great energy, beholding innumerable<br>spots covered with bowers of creepers decked with clusters of flowers,<br>from excess of gladness, became very much charmed. And the forest was<br>exceedingly beautiful in consequence of those trees ranged around with<br>flowery branches twining with each other and looking like so many<br>rainbows for gaudiness and variety of colour. And it was the resort of<br>bands of Siddhas, of the Charanas, of tribes of Gandharvas, and Apsaras,<br>of monkeys and Kinnaras drunk with delight. Delicious cool, and fragrant<br>breezes, conveying the fragrance from fresh flowers, blew in all<br>directions as if they had come there to sport with the trees. And the<br>king saw that charming forest gifted with such beauties. And it was<br>situated in a delta of the river, and the cluster of high trees standing<br>together lent the place the look of a gaudy pole erected to Indra's<br>honour.<br><br>"And in that forest which was the resort of ever cheerful birds, the<br>monarch saw a delightful and charming retreat of ascetics. And there were<br>many trees around it. And the sacred fire was burning within it. And the<br>king worshipped that unrivalled retreat. And he saw seated in it numerous<br>Yotis, Valakhilyas and other Munis. And it was adorned with many chambers<br>containing sacrificial fire. And the flowers dropping from the trees had<br>formed a thick carpet spread over the ground. And the spot looked<br>exceedingly beautiful with those tall trees of large trunks. And by it<br>flowed, O king, the sacred and transparent Malini with every species of<br>water-fowl playing on its bosom. And that stream infused gladness into<br>the hearts of the ascetics who resorted to it for purposes of ablutions.<br>And the king beheld on its banks many innocent animals of the deer<br>species and was exceedingly delighted with all that he saw.<br><br>"And the monarch, the course of whose chariot no foe could obstruct, then<br>entered that asylum which was like unto the region of the celestials,<br>being exceedingly beautiful all over. And the king saw that it stood on<br>the margin of the sacred stream which was like the mother of all the<br>living creatures residing in its vicinage. And on its bank sported the<br>Chakravaka, and waves of milkwhite foam. And there stood also the<br>habitations of Kinnaras. And monkeys and bears too disported themselves<br>in numbers. And there lived also holy ascetics engaged in studies and<br>meditation. And there could be seen also elephants and tigers and snakes.<br>And it was on the banks of that stream that the excellent asylum of the<br>illustrious Kasyapa stood, offering a home to numerous Rishis of great<br>ascetic merit. And beholding that river, and also the asylum washed by<br>that river which was studded with many islands and which possessed banks<br>of so much beauty,&#8212;an asylum like unto that of Nara and Narayana laved<br>by the water of the Ganga&#8212;the king resolved to enter into that sacred<br>abode. And that bull among men, desirous of beholding the great Rishi of<br>ascetic wealth, the illustrious Kanwa of the race of Kasyapa, one who<br>possessed every virtue and who, for his splendour, could be gazed at with<br>difficulty, approached that forest resounding with the notes of maddened<br>peacocks and like unto the gardens of the great Gandharva, Chitraratha,<br>himself. And halting his army consisting of flags, cavalry, infantry, and<br>elephants at the entrance of the forest, the monarch spoke as follows, 'I<br>shall go to behold the mighty ascetic of Kasyapa's race, one who is<br>without darkness. Stay ye here until my return!'<br><br>"And the king having entered that forest which was like unto Indra's<br>garden, soon forgot his hunger and thirst. And he was pleased beyond<br>measure. And the monarch, laying aside all signs of royalty, entered that<br>excellent asylum with but his minister and his priest, desirous of<br>beholding that Rishi who was an indestructible mass of ascetic merit. And<br>the king saw that the asylum was like unto the region of Brahman. Here<br>were bees sweetly humming and there were winged warblers of various<br>species pouring forth their melodies. At particular places that tiger<br>among men heard the chanting of Rik hymns by first-rate Brahmanas<br>according to the just rules of intonation. Other places again were graced<br>with Brahmanas acquainted with ordinances of sacrifice, of the Angas and<br>of the hymns of the Yajurveda. Other places again were filled with the<br>harmonious strains of Saman hymns sung by vow-observing Rishis. At other<br>places the asylum was decked with Brahmanas learned in the Atharvan Veda.<br>At other places again Brahmanas learned in the Atharvan Veda and those<br>capable of chanting the sacrificial hymns of the Saman were reciting the<br>Samhitas according to the just rules of voice. And at other places again,<br>other Brahmanas well-acquainted with the science of orthoepy were<br>reciting mantras of other kinds. In fact, that sacred retreat resounding<br>with these holy notes was like unto a second region of Brahman himself.<br>And there were many Brahmanas skilled in the art of making sacrificial<br>platforms and in the rules of Krama in sacrifices, conversant with logic<br>and the mental sciences, and possessing a complete knowledge of the<br>Vedas. There were those also who were fully acquainted with the meanings<br>of all kinds of expressions; those that were conversant with all special<br>rites, those also that were followers of Moksha-Dharma; those again that<br>were well-skilled in establishing propositions; rejecting superfluous<br>causes, and drawing right conclusions. There were those having a<br>knowledge of the science of words (grammar), of prosody, of Nirukta;<br>those again that were conversant with astrology and learned in the<br>properties of matter and the fruits of sacrificial rites, possessing a<br>knowledge of causes and effects, capable of understanding the cries of<br>birds and monkeys, well-read in large treatises, and skilled in various<br>sciences. And the king, as he proceeded, heard their voices. And the<br>retreat resounded also with voice of men capable of charming human<br>hearts. And the slayer of hostile heroes also saw around him learned<br>Brahmanas of rigid vows engaged in Japa (the repeated muttering of the<br>names of gods) and Homa (burnt-offering). And the king wondered much on<br>beholding the beautiful carpets which those Brahmanas offered to him<br>respectfully. And that best of monarchs, at the sight of the rites with<br>which those Brahmanas worshipped the gods and the great Rishis, thought<br>within himself that he was in the region of Brahman. And the more the<br>king saw that auspicious and sacred asylum of Kasyapa protected by that<br>Rishi's ascetic virtues and possessing all the requisites of a holy<br>retreat, the more he desired to see it. In fact, he was not satisfied<br>with his short survey. And the slayer of heroes at last, accompanied by<br>his minister and his priest, entered that charming and sacred retreat of<br>Kasyapa inhabited all around by Rishis of ascetic wealth and exalted<br>vows.'"
