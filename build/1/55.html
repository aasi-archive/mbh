                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Astika said, 'Soma and Varuna and Prajapati performed sacrifices of old<br>in Prayaga. But thy sacrifice, O foremost one of Bharata's race, O son of<br>Parikshit, is not inferior to any of those. Let those dear unto us be<br>blessed! Sakra performed a hundred sacrifices. But this sacrifice of<br>thine, O foremost one of Bharata's race, O son of Parikshit, is fully<br>equal to ten thousand sacrifices of Sakra. Let those dear unto us be<br>blessed! Like the sacrifice of Yama, of Harimedha, or of king Rantideva,<br>is the sacrifice of thine, O foremost one of Bharata's race, O son of<br>Parikshit. Let those dear unto us be blessed! Like the sacrifice of Maya,<br>of king Sasavindu, or of king Vaisravana, is this sacrifice of thine, O<br>foremost one of Bharata's race, O son of Satyavati, in which he himself<br>was the chief priest, is this sacrifice of Nriga, of Ajamida, of the son<br>of Dasaratha, is this sacrifice of thine, O foremost one of Bharata's<br>race, O son of Parikshit. Let those dear unto us be blessed! Like the<br>sacrifice of king Yudhishthira, the son of a god and belonging to Ajamida<br>race, heard of (even) in the heavens, is this sacrifice of thine. O<br>foremost one of Bharata's race, O son of Parikshit, let those dear unto<br>us be blessed! Like the sacrifice of Krishna (Dwaipayana), the son of<br>Satyavati, in which he himself was the chief priest, is this sacrifice of<br>thine, O foremost one of Bharata's race, O son of Parikshit Let those<br>dear unto us be blessed! These (Ritwiks and Sadasyas) that are here<br>engaged in making thy sacrifice, like unto that of the slayer of Vritra,<br>are of splendour equal to that of the sun. There now remains nothing for<br>them to know, and gifts made to them become inexhaustible (in merit). It<br>is my conviction that there is no Ritwik in all the worlds who is equal<br>to thy Ritwik, Dwaipayana. His disciples, becoming Ritwiks, competent for<br>their duties, travel over the earth. The high-souled bearer of libation<br>(viz., Agni), called also Vibhavasu and Chitrabhanu, having gold for his<br>vital seed and having his path, marked by black smoke, blazing up with<br>flames inclined to the right, beareth these thy libations of clarified<br>butter to the gods. In this world of men there is no other monarch equal<br>to thee in the protection of subjects. I am ever well-pleased with thy<br>abstinence. Indeed, thou art either Varuna, or Yama, the god of Justice.<br>Like Sakra himself, thunderbolt in hand, thou art, in this world, the<br>protector of all creatures. In this earth there is no man so great as<br>thou and no monarch who is thy equal in sacrifice. Thou art like<br>Khatwanga, Nabhaga, and Dilipa. In prowess thou art like Yayati and<br>Mandhatri. In splendour equal to the sun, and of excellent vows, thou art<br>O monarch, like Bhishma! Like Valmiki thou art of energy concealed. Like<br>Vasishtha thou hast controlled thy wrath. Like Indra is thy lordship. Thy<br>splendour also shines like that of Narayana. Like Yama art thou<br>conversant with the dispensation of justice. Thou art like Krishna<br>adorned with every virtue. Thou art the home of the good fortune that<br>belongs to the Vasus. Thou art also the refuge of the sacrifices. In<br>strength thou art equal to Damvodbhava. Like Rama (the son of Jamadagni)<br>thou art conversant with the scriptures and arms. In energy thou art<br>equal to Aurva and Trita. Thou inspirest terror by thy looks like<br>Bhagiratha.'<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Astika, having thus adored them, gratified them all, viz.,<br>the king, the Sadasyas, the Ritwiks and the sacrificial fire. And king<br>Janamejaya beholding the signs and indications manifested all around,<br>addressed them as follows.'"
