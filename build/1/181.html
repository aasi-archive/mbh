                            (Chaitraratha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vasishtha continued, 'The Brahmana lady, thus addressed by them, said,<br>'Ye children, I have not robbed you of your eye-sight, nor am I angry<br>with you. This child, however, of the Bhrigu race hath certainly been<br>angry with you. There is little doubt, ye children, that ye have been<br>robbed of your sight by that illustrious child whose wrath hath been<br>kindled at the remembrance of the slaughter of his race. Ye children,<br>while ye were destroying even the embryos of the Bhrigu race, this child<br>was held by me in my thigh for a hundred years! And in order that the<br>prosperity of Bhrigu's race might be restored, the entire Vedas with<br>their branches came unto this one even while he was in the womb. It is<br>plain that this scion of the Bhrigu race, enraged at the slaughter of his<br>fathers, desireth to slay you! It is by his celestial energy that your<br>eyes have been scorched. Therefore, ye children, pray ye unto this my<br>excellent child born of my thigh. Propitiated by your homage he may<br>restore your eye-sight.'<br><br>"Vasishtha continued, 'Hearing those words of the Brahmana lady, all<br>these princes addressed the thigh-born child, saying, 'Be propitious!'<br>And the child became propitious unto them. And that best of Brahmana<br>Rishis, in consequence of his having been born after tearing open his<br>mother's thigh, came to be known throughout the three worlds by the name<br>of Aurva (thigh-born). And those princes regaining their eye-sight went<br>away. But the Muni Aurva of the Bhrigu race resolved upon overcoming the<br>whole world. And the high-souled Rishi set his heart, O child, upon the<br>destruction of every creature in the world. And that scion of the Bhrigu<br>race, for paying homage (as he regarded) unto his slaughtered ancestors,<br>devoted himself to the austerest of penances with the object of<br>destroying the whole world. And desirous of gratifying his ancestors, the<br>Rishi afflicted by his severe asceticism the three worlds with the<br>celestials, the Asuras and human beings. The Pitris, then, learning what<br>the child of their race was about, all came from their own region unto<br>the Rishi and addressing him said:<br><br>'Aurva, O son, fierce thou hast been in thy asceticism. Thy power hath<br>been witnessed by us. Be propitious unto the three worlds. O, control thy<br>wrath. O child, it was not from incapacity that the Bhrigus of souls<br>under complete control were, all of them, indifferent to their own<br>destruction at the hands of the murderous Kshatriyas. O child, when we<br>grew weary of the long periods of life alloted to us, it was then that we<br>desired our own destruction through the instrumentality of the<br>Kshatriyas. The wealth that the Bhrigus had placed in their house<br>underground had been placed only with the object of enraging the<br>Kshatriyas and picking a quarrel with them. O thou best of Brahmanas, as<br>we were desirous of heaven, of what use could wealth be to us? The<br>treasurer of heaven (Kuvera) had kept a large treasure for us. When we<br>found that death could not, by any means, overtake us all, it was then, O<br>child, that we regarded this as the best means (of compassing our<br>desire). They who commit suicide never attain to regions that are<br>blessed. Reflecting upon this, we abstained from self-destruction. That<br>which, therefore thou desirest to do is not agreeable to us. Restrain thy<br>mind, therefore, from the sinful act of destroying the whole world. O<br>child, destroy not the Kshatriyas nor the seven worlds. O, kill this<br>wrath of thine that staineth thy ascetic energy.'"
