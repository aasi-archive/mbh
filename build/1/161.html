                            (Vaka-vadha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'On hearing these words of her afflicted parents, the<br>daughter was filled with grief, and she addressed them, saying, 'Why are<br>you so afflicted and why do you so weep, as if you have none to look<br>after you? O, listen to me and do what may be proper. There is little<br>doubt that you are bound in duty to abandon me at a certain time. Sure to<br>abandon me once, O, abandon me now and save every thing at the expense of<br>me alone. Men desire to have children, thinking that children would save<br>them (in this world as well as in the region hereafter). O, cross the<br>stream of your difficulties by means of my poor self, as if I were a<br>raft. A child rescueth his parents in this and the other regions;<br>therefore is the child called by the learned Putra (rescuer). The<br>ancestors desire daughter's sons from me (as a special means of<br>salvation). But (without waiting for my children) I myself will rescue<br>them by protecting the life of my father. This my brother is of tender<br>years, so there is little doubt that he will perish if thou diest now. If<br>thou, my father, diest and my brother followeth thee, the funeral cake of<br>the Pitris will be suspended and they will be greatly injured. Left<br>behind by my father and brother, and by my mother also (for she will not<br>survive her husband and son) I shall be plunged deeper and deeper in woe<br>and ultimately perish in great distress. There can be little doubt that<br>if thou escape from this danger as also my mother and infant brother,<br>then thy race and the (ancestral) cake will be perpetuated. The son is<br>one's own self; the wife is one's friend; the daughter, however, is the<br>source of trouble. Do thou save thyself, therefore, by removing that<br>source of trouble, and do thou thereby set me in the path of virtue. As I<br>am a girl, O father, destitute of thee, I shall be helpless and plunged<br>in woe, and shall have to go everywhere. It is therefore that I am<br>resolved to rescue my father's race and share the merit of that act by<br>accomplishing this difficult task. If thou, O best of Brahmanas, goest<br>thither (unto the Rakshasa), leaving me here, then I shall be very much<br>pained. Therefore, O father, be kind to me. O thou best of men, for our<br>sake, for that of virtue and also thy race, save thyself, abandoning me,<br>whom at one time thou shall be constrained to part from. There need be no<br>delay, O father, in doing that which is inevitable. What can be more<br>painful than that, when thou hast ascended to heaven, we shall have to go<br>about begging our food, like dogs, from strangers. But if thou art<br>rescued with thy relations from these difficulties, I shall then live<br>happily in the region of the celestials. It hath been heard by us that if<br>after bestowing thy daughter in this way, thou offerest oblations to the<br>gods and the celestials, they will certainly be propitious.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The Brahmana and his wife, hearing these<br>various lamentations of their daughter, became sadder than before and the<br>three began to weep together. Their son, then, of tender years, beholding<br>them and their daughter thus weeping together, lisped these words in a<br>sweet tone, his eyes having dilated with delight, 'Weep not, O father,<br>nor thou, O mother, nor thou O sister!' And smilingly did the child<br>approach each of them, and at last taking up a blade of grass said in<br>glee, 'With this will I slay the Rakshasa who eateth human beings!'<br>Although all of them had been plunged in woe, yet hearing what the child<br>lisped so sweetly, joy appeared on their faces. Then Kunti thinking that<br>to be the proper opportunity, approached the group and said these words.<br>Indeed, her words revived them as nectar reviveth a person that is dead.'"
