                            (Swayamvara Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'When all the monarchs had desisted from<br>stringing that bow, the high-souled Jishnu arose from among the crowd of<br>Brahmanas seated in that assembly. And beholding Partha possessing the<br>complexion of Indra's banner, advancing towards the bow, the principal<br>Brahmanas shaking their deer-skins raised a loud clamour. And while some<br>were displeased, there were others that were well-pleased. And some there<br>were, possessed of intelligence and foresight, who addressing one another<br>said, 'Ye Brahmanas, how can a Brahmana stripling unpractised in arms and<br>weak in strength, string that bow which such celebrated Kshatriyas as<br>Salya and others endued with might and accomplished in the science and<br>practice of arms could not? If he doth not achieve success in this<br>untried task which he hath undertaken from a spirit of boyish<br>unsteadiness, the entire body of Brahmanas here will be rendered<br>ridiculous in the eyes of the assembled monarchs. Therefore, forbid this<br>Brahmana that he may not go to string the bow which he is even now<br>desirous of doing from vanity, childish daring, or mere unsteadiness.'<br>Others replied, 'We shall not be made ridiculous, nor shall we incur the<br>disrespect of anybody or the displeasure of the sovereigns. Some<br>remarked, 'This handsome youth is even like the trunk of a mighty<br>elephant, whose shoulders and arms and thighs are so well-built, who in<br>patience looks like the Himavat, whose gait is even like that of the<br>lion, and whose prowess seems to be like that of an elephant in rut, and<br>who is so resolute, that it is probable that he will accomplish this<br>feat. He has strength and resolution. If he had none, he would never go<br>of his own accord. Besides, there is nothing in the three worlds that<br>Brahmanas of all mortal men cannot accomplish. Abstaining from all food<br>or living upon air or eating of fruits, persevering in their vows, and<br>emaciated and weak, Brahmanas are ever strong in their own energy. One<br>should never disregard a Brahmana whether his acts be right or wrong, by<br>supposing him incapable of achieving any task that is great or little, or<br>that is fraught with bliss or woe. Rama the son of Jamadagni defeated in<br>battle, all the Kshatriyas. Agastya by his Brahma energy drank off the<br>fathomless ocean. Therefore, say ye, 'Let this youth bend the bow and<br>string it with ease' (and many said), 'So be it.' And the Brahmanas<br>continued speaking unto one another these and other words. Then Arjuna<br>approached the bow and stood there like a mountain. And walking round<br>that bow, and bending his head unto that giver of boons&#8212;the lord<br>Isana&#8212;and remembering Krishna also, he took it up. And that bow which<br>Rukma, Sunitha, Vakra, Radha's son, Duryodhana, Salya, and many other<br>kings accomplished in the science and practice of arms, could not even<br>with great exertion, string, Arjuna, the son of Indra, that foremost of<br>all persons endued with energy and like unto the younger brother of Indra<br>(Vishnu) in might, strung in the twinkling of an eye. And taking up the<br>five arrows he shot the mark and caused it to fall down on the ground<br>through the hole in the machine above which it had been placed. Then<br>there arose a loud uproar in the firmament, and the amphitheatre also<br>resounded with a loud clamour. And the gods showered celestial flowers on<br>the head of Partha the slayer of foes. And thousands of Brahmanas began<br>to wave their upper garments in joy. And all around, the monarchs who had<br>been unsuccessful, uttered exclamations of grief and despair. And flowers<br>were rained from the skies all over the amphitheatre. And the musicians<br>struck up in concert. Bards and heralds began to chant in sweet tones the<br>praises (of the hero who accomplished the feat). And beholding Arjuna,<br>Drupada&#8212;that slayer of foes,&#8212;was filled with joy. And the monarch<br>desired to assist with his forces the hero if the occasion arose. And<br>when the uproar was at its height, Yudhishthira, the foremost of all<br>virtuous men, accompanied by those first of men the twins, hastily left<br>the amphitheatre for returning to his temporary home. And Krishna<br>beholding the mark shot and beholding Partha also like unto Indra<br>himself, who had shot the mark, was filled with joy, and approached the<br>son of Kunti with a white robe and a garland of flowers. And Arjuna the<br>accomplisher of inconceivable feats, having won Draupadi by his success<br>in the amphitheatre, was saluted with reverence by all the Brahmanas. And<br>he soon after left the lists followed close by her who thus became his<br>wife.'"
