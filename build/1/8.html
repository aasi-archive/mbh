                            (Pauloma Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'O Brahmana, Chyavana, the son of Bhrigu, begot a son in the<br>womb of his wife Sukanya. And that son was the illustrious Pramati of<br>resplendent energy. And Pramati begot in the womb of Ghritachi a son<br>called Ruru. And Ruru begot on his wife Pramadvara a son called Sunaka.<br>And I shall relate to you in detail, O Brahmana, the entire history of<br>Ruru of abundant energy. O listen to it then in full!<br><br>"Formerly there was a great Rishi called Sthulakesa possessed of ascetic<br>power and learning and kindly disposed towards all creatures. At that<br>time, O Brahmana sage, Viswavasu, the King of the Gandharvas, it is said,<br>had intimacy with Menaka, the celestial dancing-girl. And the Apsara,<br>Menaka, O thou of the Bhrigu race, when her time was come, brought forth<br>an infant near the hermitage of Sthulakesa. And dropping the newborn<br>infant on the banks of the river, O Brahmana, Menaka, the Apsara, being<br>destitute of pity and shame, went away. And the Rishi, Sthulakesa, of<br>great ascetic power, discovered the infant lying forsaken in a lonely<br>part of the river-side. And he perceived that it was a female child,<br>bright as the offspring of an Immortal and blazing, as it were, with<br>beauty: And the great Brahmana, Sthulakesa, the first of Munis, seeing<br>that female child, and filled with compassion, took it up and reared it.<br>And the lovely child grew up in his holy habitation, the noble-minded and<br>blessed Rishi Sthulakesa performing in due succession all the ceremonies<br>beginning with that at birth as ordained by the divine law. And because<br>she surpassed all of her sex in goodness, beauty, and every quality, the<br>great Rishi called her by the name of Pramadvara. And the pious Ruru<br>having seen Pramadvara in the hermitage of Sthulakesa became one whose<br>heart was pierced by the god of love. And Ruru by means of his companions<br>made his father Pramati, the son of Bhrigu, acquainted with his passion.<br>And Pramati demanded her of the far-famed Sthulakesa for his son. And her<br>foster-father betrothed the virgin Pramadvara to Ruru, fixing the<br>nuptials for the day when the star Varga-Daivata (Purva-phalguni) would<br>be ascendant.<br><br>"Then within a few days of the time fixed for the nuptials, the beautiful<br>virgin while at play with companions of her own sex, her time having<br>come, impelled by fate, trod upon a serpent which she did not perceive as<br>it lay in coil. And the reptile, urged to execute the will of Fate,<br>violently darted its envenomed fangs into the body of the heedless<br>maiden. And stung by that serpent, she instantly dropped senseless on the<br>ground, her colour faded and all the graces of her person went off. And<br>with dishevelled hair she became a spectacle of woe to her companions and<br>friends. And she who was so agreeable to behold became on her death what<br>was too painful to look at. And the girl of slender waist lying on the<br>ground like one asleep&#8212;being overcome with the poison of the snake-once<br>more became more beautiful than in life. And her foster-father and the<br>other holy ascetics who were there, all saw her lying motionless upon the<br>ground with the splendour of a lotus. And then there came many noted<br>Brahmanas filled with compassion, and they sat around her. And<br>Swastyatreya, Mahajana, Kushika, Sankhamekhala, Uddalaka, Katha, and<br>Sweta of great renown, Bharadwaja, Kaunakutsya, Arshtishena, Gautama,<br>Pramati, and Pramati's son Ruru, and other inhabitants of the forest,<br>came there. And when they saw that maiden lying dead on the ground<br>overcome with the poison of the reptile that had bitten her, they all<br>wept filled with compassion. But Ruru, mortified beyond measure, retired<br>from the scene.'"<br><br>So ends the eighth section of the Pauloma Parva of the Adi Parva of the<br>blessed Mahabharata.
