                            (Vaivahika Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then the illustrious king of Panchala, addressing<br>prince Yudhishthira in the form applicable to Brahmanas, cheerfully<br>enquired of that illustrious son of Kunti, saying, 'Are we to know you as<br>Kshatriyas, or Brahamanas, or are we to know you as celestials who<br>disguising themselves as Brahmanas are ranging the earth and come hither<br>for the hand of Krishna? O tell us truly, for we have great doubts! Shall<br>we not be glad when our doubts have been removed? O chastiser of enemies,<br>have the fates been propitious unto us? Tell us the truth willingly!<br>Truth becometh monarchs better than sacrifices and dedications of tanks.<br>Therefore, tell us not what is untrue. O thou of the beauty of a<br>celestial, O chastiser of foes, hearing thy reply I shall make<br>arrangements for my daughter's wedding according to the order to which ye<br>belong.'<br><br>"Hearing these words of Drupada, Yudhishthira answered, saying 'Be not<br>cheerless, O king; let joy fill thy heart! The desire cherished by thee<br>hath certainly been accomplished. We are Kshatriyas, O king, and sons of<br>the illustrious Pandu. Know me to be the eldest of the sons of Kunti and<br>these to be Bhima and Arjuna. By these, O king, was thy daughter won amid<br>the concourse of monarchs. The twins (Nakula and Sahadeva) and Kunti wait<br>where Krishna is. O bull amongst men, let grief be driven from thy heart,<br>for we are Kshatriyas. Thy daughter, O monarch, hath like a lotus been<br>transferred only from one lake into another. O king, thou art our revered<br>superior and chief refuge. I have told thee the whole truth.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing those words, the king Drupada's eyes<br>rolled in ecstasy. And. filled with delight the king could not, for some<br>moments answer Yudhishthira. Checking his emotion with great effort, that<br>chastiser of foes at last replied unto Yudhishthira in proper words. The<br>virtuous monarch enquired how the Pandavas had escaped from the town of<br>Varanavata. The son of Pandu told the monarch every particular in detail<br>of their escape from the burning palace of lac. Hearing everything that<br>the son of Kunti said, king Drupada censured Dhritarashtra, that ruler of<br>men. And the monarch gave every assurance unto Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Kunti. And that foremost of eloquent men then and there vowed to restore<br>Yudhishthira to his paternal throne.<br><br>"Then Kunti and Krishna and Bhima and Arjuna and the twins, commanded by<br>the king, to reside there, treated by Yajnasena with due respect. Then<br>king Drupada with his sons, assured by all that had happened, approaching<br>Yudhishthira, said, 'O thou of mighty arms, let the Kuru prince Arjuna<br>take with due rites, the hand of my daughter on this auspicious day, and<br>let him, therefore, perform the usual initiatory rites of marriage.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of Drupada, the virtuous<br>king Yudhishthira replied, saying, 'O great king, I also shall have to<br>marry.' Hearing him, Drupada said, 'If it pleaseth thee, take thou the<br>hand of my daughter thyself with due rites. Or, give Krishna in marriage<br>unto whomsoever of thy brothers thou likest.' Yudhishthira said, 'Thy<br>daughter, O king, shall be the common wife of us all! Even thus it hath<br>been ordered, O monarch, by our mother. I am unmarried still, and Bhima<br>also is so amongst the sons of Pandu. This thy jewel of a daughter hath<br>been won by Arjuna. This, O king, is the rule with us; to ever enjoy<br>equally a jewel that we may obtain. O best of monarchs, that rule of<br>conduct we cannot now abandon. Krishna, therefore, shall become the<br>wedded wife of us all. Let her take our hands, one after another before<br>the fire.'<br><br>'Drupada answered, 'O scion of Kuru's race, it hath been directed that<br>one man may have many wives. But it hath never been heard that one woman<br>may have many husbands! O son of Kunti, as thou art pure and acquainted<br>with the rules of morality, it behoveth thee not to commit an act that is<br>sinful and opposed both to usage and the Vedas. Why, O prince, hath thy<br>understanding become so?' Yudhishthira said in reply, 'O monarch,<br>morality is subtle. We do not know its course. Let us follow the way<br>trodden by the illustrious ones of former ages. My tongue never uttered<br>an untruth. My heart also never turneth to what is sinful. My mother<br>commandeth so; and my heart also approveth of it. Therefore, O king, that<br>is quite conformable to virtue. Act according to it, without any<br>scruples. Entertain no fear, O king, about this matter.'<br><br>"Drupada said, 'O son of Kunti thy mother, and my son Dhrishtadyumna and<br>thyself, settle amongst yourselves as to what should be done. Tell me the<br>result of your deliberations and tomorrow I will do what is proper.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'After this, O Bharata, Yudhishthira, Kunti and<br>Dhrishtadyumna discoursed upon this matter. Just at that time, however,<br>the island-born (Vyasa), O monarch, came there in course of his<br>wanderings.'"
