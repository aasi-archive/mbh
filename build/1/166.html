                            (Vaka-vadha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said 'Then Vaka, huge as a mountain, thus broken (on<br>Bhima's knee), died, uttering frightful yells. Terrified by these sounds,<br>the relatives of that Rakshasa came out, O king, with their attendants.<br>Bhima, that foremost of smiters, seeing them so terrified and deprived of<br>reason, comforted them and made them promise (to give up cannibalism),<br>saying, 'Do not ever again kill human beings. If ye kill men, ye will<br>have to die even as Vaka.' Those Rakshasas hearing this speech of Bhima,<br>said, 'So be it,' and gave, O king, the desired promise. From that day, O<br>Bharata, the Rakshasas (of the region) were seen by the inhabitants of<br>that town to be very peaceful towards mankind. Then Bhima, dragging the<br>lifeless cannibal, placed him at one of the gates of the town and went<br>away unobserved by any one. The kinsmen of Vaka, beholding him slain by<br>the might of Bhima, became frightened and fled in different directions.<br><br>"Meanwhile Bhima, having slain the Rakshasa, returned to the Brahmana's<br>abode and related to Yudhishthira all that had happened, in detail. The<br>next morning the inhabitants of the town in coming out saw the Rakshasa<br>lying dead on the ground, his body covered with blood. Beholding that<br>terrible cannibal, huge as a mountain cliff, thus mangled and lying on<br>the ground, the hair of the spectators stood erect. Returning to<br>Ekachakra, they soon gave the intelligence. Then, O king, the citizens by<br>thousands accompanied by their wives, young and old, all began to come to<br>the spot for beholding the Vaka and they were all amazed at seeing that<br>superhuman feat. Instantly, O monarch, they began to pray to their gods.<br>Then they began to calculate whose turn it had been the day before to<br>carry food to the Rakshasa. And ascertaining this, they all came to that<br>Brahmana and asked him (to satisfy their curiosity). Thus asked by them<br>repeatedly, that bull among Brahmanas, desirous of concealing the<br>Pandavas, said these words unto all the citizens, 'A certain high-souled<br>Brahmana, skilled in mantras, beheld me weeping with my relatives after I<br>had been ordered to supply the Rakshasa's food. Asking me the cause and<br>ascertaining the distress of the town, that first of Brahmanas gave me<br>every assurance and with smiles said, 'I shall carry the food for that<br>wretched Rakshasa today. Do not fear for me.' Saying this he conveyed the<br>food towards the forest of Vaka. This deed, so beneficial unto us all,<br>hath very certainly been done by him.'<br><br>Then those Brahmanas and Kshatriyas (of the city), hearing this, wondered<br>much. And the Vaisyas and the Sudras also became exceedingly glad, and<br>they all established a festival in which the worship of Brahmanas was the<br>principal ceremony (in remembrance of this Brahmana who had relieved them<br>from their fears of Vaka).
