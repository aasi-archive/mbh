                            (Chaitraratha Parva continued)<br><br>"Arjuna asked, 'What for, O Gandharva, did king Kalmashapada command his<br>queen to go unto that foremost of all persons conversant with the<br>Vedas&#8212;the master Vasishtha? Why also did that illustrious and great<br>Rishi Vasishtha himself who was acquainted with every rule of morality<br>know a woman he should not have known? O friend, was this an act of sin<br>on the part of Vasishtha? It behoveth thee to remove the doubts I<br>entertain and refer to thee for solution.'<br><br>"The Gandharva replied, saying, 'O irrepressible Dhananjaya, listen to me<br>as I answer the question thou hast asked in respect of Vasishtha and king<br>Kalmashapada that cherisher of friends. O thou best of the Bharatas, I<br>have told thee all about the curse of king Kalmashapada by Saktri, the<br>illustrious son of Vasishtha. Brought under the influence of the curse,<br>that smiter of all foes&#8212;king Kalmashapada&#8212;with eyes whirling in anger<br>went out of his capital accompanied by his wife. And entering with his<br>wife the solitary woods the king began to wander about. And one day while<br>the king under the influence of the curse was wandering through that<br>forest abounding in several kinds of deer and various other animals and<br>overgrown with numerous large trees and shrubs and creepers and<br>resounding with terrible cries, he became exceedingly hungry. And the<br>monarch thereupon began to search for some food. Pinched with hunger, the<br>king at last saw, in a very solitary part of the woods, a Brahmana and<br>his wife enjoying each other. Alarmed at beholding the monarch the couple<br>ran away, their desire ungratified. Pursuing the retreating pair, the<br>king forcibly seized the Brahmana. Then the Brahmani, beholding her lord<br>seized, addressed the monarch, saying, 'Listen to what I say, O monarch<br>of excellent vows! It is known all over the world that thou art born in<br>the solar race, and that thou art ever vigilant in the practice of<br>morality and devoted to the service of thy superiors. It behoveth thee<br>not to commit sin, O thou irrepressible one, deprived though thou hast<br>been of thy senses by (the Rishi's) curse. My season hath come, and<br>wishful of my husband's company I was connected with him. I have not been<br>gratified yet. Be propitious unto us, O thou best of kings! Liberate my<br>husband.' The monarch, however, without listening to her cries cruelly<br>devoured her husband like a tiger devouring its desirable prey. Possessed<br>with wrath at this sight, the tears that that woman shed blazed up like<br>fire and consumed everything in that place. Afflicted with grief at the<br>calamity that overtook her lord, the Brahmani in anger cursed the royal<br>sage Kalmashapada, 'Vile wretch, since thou hast today cruelly devoured<br>under my very nose my illustrious husband dear unto me, even before my<br>desires have been gratified, therefore shall thou, O wicked one afflicted<br>by my curse, meet with instant death when thou goest in for thy wife in<br>season. And thy wife, O wretch, shall bring forth a son uniting herself<br>with that Rishi Vasishtha whose children have been devoured by thee. And<br>that child, O worst of kings, shall be the perpetuator of thy race.' And<br>cursing the monarch thus, that lady of Angira's house bearing every<br>auspicious mark, entered the blazing fire in the very sight of the<br>monarch. And, O thou oppressor of all foes, the illustrious and exalted<br>Vasishtha by his ascetic power and spiritual insight immediately knew<br>all. And long after this, when the king became freed from his curse, he<br>approached his wife Madayanati when her season came. But Madayanati<br>softly sent him away. Under the influence of passion the monarch had no<br>recollection of that curse. Hearing, however, the words of his wife, the<br>best of kings became terribly alarmed. And recollecting the curse he<br>repented bitterly of what he had done. It was for this reason, O thou<br>best of men, that the monarch infected with the Brahmani's curse,<br>appointed Vasishtha to beget a son upon his queen.'"
