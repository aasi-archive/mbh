                            (Chaitraratha Parva continued)<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'Thou hast addressed me (more than once) as Tapatya. I<br>therefore wish to know what the precise significance of this word is, O<br>virtuous Gandharva, being sons of Kunti, we are, indeed, Kaunteyas. But<br>who is Tapati that we should be called Tapatyas?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, the Gandharva related to<br>Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, the (following) story well-known in the<br>three worlds.'<br><br>"The Gandharva said, 'O son of Pritha, O foremost of all intelligent men,<br>I will duly recite to you in full this charming narrative. O, listen with<br>attention to what I say in explanation of why I have addressed thee as<br>Tapatya. That one in heaven who pervadeth by his light the whole<br>firmament had a daughter named Tapati equal unto himself. Tapati, the<br>daughter of the god Vivaswat, was the younger sister of Savitri, and she<br>was celebrated throughout the three worlds and devoted to ascetic<br>penances. There was no woman amongst the celestials, the Asuras, the<br>Yakshas, the Rakshasas, the Apsaras, and the Gandharvas, who was equal to<br>her in beauty. Of perfect, symmetrical and faultless features, of black<br>and large eyes, and in beautiful attire, the girl was chaste and of<br>perfect conduct. And, O Bharata, seeing her Savitri (the sun) thought<br>that there was none in the three worlds who, for his beauty,<br>accomplishments, behaviour, and learning, deserved to be her husband.<br>Beholding her attain the age of puberty and, therefore, worthy of being<br>bestowed on a husband, her father knew no peace of mind, always thinking<br>of the person he should select. At that time, O son of Kunti, Riksha's<br>son, that bull amongst the Kurus, the mighty king Samvarana, was duly<br>worshipping Surya with offerings of Arghya and flower-garlands and<br>scents, and with vows and fasts and ascetic penances of various kinds.<br>Indeed, Samvarana was worshipping Surya constantly in all his glory, with<br>devotion and humility and piety. And beholding Samvarana conversant with<br>all rules of virtue and unequalled on earth for beauty, Surya regarded<br>him as the fit husband for his daughter, Tapati. And, O thou of Kuru's<br>race, Vivaswat then resolved to bestow his daughter on that best of<br>kings, viz., Samvarana, the scion of a race of world-wide fame. As Surya<br>himself in the heavens filleth the firmament with his splendour, so did<br>king Samvarana on earth fill every region with the splendour of his good<br>achievements. And all men, O Partha, except Brahmanas, worshipped<br>Samvarana. Blest with good luck, king Samvarana excelled Soma in soothing<br>the hearts of friends and Surya in scorching the hearts of foes. And, O<br>Kaurava, Tapana (Surya) himself was resolved upon bestowing his daughter<br>Tapati upon king Samvarana, who was possessed of such virtues and<br>accomplishments.<br><br>"Once on a time, O Partha, king Samvarana, endued with beauty (of person)<br>and immeasurable prowess, went on a hunting expedition to the under-woods<br>on the mountain-breast. While wandering in quest of deer, the excellent<br>steed the king rode, overcome, O Partha, with hunger, thirst and fatigue,<br>died on the mountains. Abandoning the steed, the king, O Arjuna, began to<br>wander about upon the mountain-breast on foot and in course of his<br>wandering the monarch saw a maiden of large eyes and unrivalled beauty,<br>That grinder of hostile host&#8212;that tiger among kings&#8212;himself without a<br>companion, beholding there that maiden without a companion, stood<br>motionless gazing at her steadfastly. For her beauty, the monarch for<br>some moment believed her to be (the goddess) Sri herself. Next he<br>regarded her to be the embodiment of the rays emanating from Surya. In<br>splendour of her person she resembled a flame of fire, though in<br>benignity and loveliness she resembled a spotless digit of the moon. And<br>standing on the mountain-breast, the black-eyed maiden appeared like a<br>bright statue of gold. The mountain itself with its creepers and plants,<br>because of the beauty and attire of that damsel, seemed to be converted<br>into gold. The sight of that maiden inspired the monarch with a contempt<br>for all women that he had seen before. By beholding her, the king<br>regarded his eye-sight truly blessed. Nothing the king had seen from the<br>day of his birth could equal, he thought, the beauty of that girl. The<br>king's heart and eyes were captivated by that damsel, as if they were<br>bound with a cord and he remained rooted to that spot, deprived of his<br>senses. The monarch thought that the artificer of so much beauty had<br>created it only after churning the whole world of gods Asuras and human<br>beings. Entertaining these various thoughts, king Samvarana regarded that<br>maiden as unrivalled in the three worlds for wealth of beauty.<br><br>"And the monarch of pure descent, beholding the beautiful maiden, was<br>pierced with Kama's (Cupid's) shafts and lost his peace of mind. Burnt<br>with the strong flame of desire the king asked that charming maiden,<br>still innocent, though in her full youth, saying, 'Who art thou and<br>whose? Why also dost thou stay here? O thou of sweet smiles, why dost<br>thou wander alone in these solitary woods? Of every feature perfectly<br>faultless, and decked with every ornament, thou seemest to be the coveted<br>ornament of these ornaments themselves! Thou seemest not to be of<br>celestial or Asura or Yaksha or Rakshasa or Naga or Gandharva or human<br>origin. O excellent lady, the best of women that I have ever seen or<br>heard of would not compare with thee in beauty! O thou of handsome face,<br>at sight of thee lovelier than the moon and graced with eyes like<br>lotus-petals, the god of desire is grinding me.'<br><br>"King Samvarana thus addressed that damsel in the forest, who however,<br>spoke not a word unto the monarch burning with desire. Instead, like<br>lightning in the clouds, that large-eyed maiden quickly disappeared in<br>the very sight of the monarch. The king then wandered through the whole<br>forest, like one out of his senses, in search of that girl of eyes like<br>lotus-petals. Failing to find her, that best of monarchs indulged in<br>copious lamentations and for a time stood motionless with grief.'"
