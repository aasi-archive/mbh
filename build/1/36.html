                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Saunaka said, 'O child, thou hast named many of the serpents gifted with<br>great energy and incapable of being easily overcome. What did they do<br>after hearing of that curse?'<br><br>"Sauti said, 'The illustrious Sesha amongst them, of great renown,<br>leaving his mother practised hard penances, living upon air and rigidly<br>observing his vows. He practised these ascetic devotions, repairing to<br>Gandhamadana, Vadri, Gokarna, the woods of Pushkara, and the foot of<br>Himavat. And he passed his days in those sacred regions, some of which<br>were sacred for their water and others for their soil in the rigid<br>observance of his vows, with singleness of aim, and his passions under<br>complete control. And the Grandsire of all, Brahma, saw that ascetic with<br>knotted hair, clad in rags, and his flesh, skin, and sinews dried up<br>owing to the hard penances he was practising. And the Grandsire<br>addressing him, that penance-practising one of great fortitude, said,<br>'What is that thorn doest, O Sesha? Let the welfare of the creatures of<br>the worlds also engage thy thoughts. O sinless one, thou art afflicting<br>all creatures by thy hard penances. O Sesha, tell me the desire implanted<br>in thy breast.'<br><br>"And Sesha replied, 'My uterine brothers are all of wicked hearts. I do<br>not desire to live amongst them. Let this be sanctioned by thee. Like<br>enemies they are always jealous of one another. I am, therefore, engaged<br>in ascetic devotions. I will not see them even. They never show any<br>kindness for Vinata and her son. Indeed, Vinata's son capable of ranging<br>through the skies, is another brother of ours. They always envy him. And<br>he, too, is much stronger owing to the bestowal of that boon by our<br>father, the high-souled Kasyapa. For these, I engaged in ascetic<br>penances, and I will cast off this body of mine, so that I may avoid<br>companionship with them, even in another state of life.'<br><br>"Unto Sesha who had said so, the Grandsire said, 'O Sesha, I know the<br>behaviour of all thy brothers and their great danger owing to their<br>offence against their mother. But O Snake, a remedy (for this) hath been<br>provided by me even beforehand. It behoveth thee not to grieve for thy<br>brothers. O Sesha, ask of me the boon thou desirest. I have been highly<br>gratified with thee and I will grant thee today a boon. O best of snakes,<br>it is fortunate that thy heart hath been set on virtue. Let thy heart be<br>more and more firmly set on virtue.'<br><br>"Then Sesha replied, 'O divine Grandsire, this is the boon desired by me;<br>viz., may my heart always delight in virtue and in blessed ascetic<br>penances, O Lord of all!'<br><br>"Brahman said, 'O Sesha, I am exceedingly gratified with this thy<br>self-denial and love of peace. But, at my command, let this act be done<br>by thee for the good of my creatures. Bear thou, O Sesha, properly and<br>well this Earth so unsteady with her mountains and forests, her seas and<br>towns and retreats, so that she may be steady.'<br><br>"Sesha said, 'O divine Lord of all creatures, O bestower of boons, O lord<br>of the Earth, lord of every created thing, lord of the universe, I will,<br>even as thou sayest hold the Earth steady. Therefore, O lord of all<br>creatures, place her on my head.'<br><br>"Brahman said, 'O best of snakes, go underneath the Earth. She will<br>herself give thee a crevice to pass through. And, O Sesha, by holding the<br>Earth, thou shalt certainly do what is prized by me very greatly.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Then the elder brother of the king of the snakes,<br>entering a hole, passed to the other side of the Earth, and holding her,<br>supported with his head that goddess with her belt of seas passing all<br>round.'<br><br>"Brahman said, 'O Sesha, O best of snakes, thou art the god Dharma,<br>because alone, with thy huge body, thou supportest the Earth with<br>everything on her, even as I myself, or Valavit (Indra), can.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'The snake, Sesha, the lord Ananta, of great prowess,<br>lives underneath the Earth, alone supporting the world at the command of<br>Brahman. And the illustrious Grandsire, the best of the immortals, then<br>gave unto Ananta the bird of fair feathers, viz., the son of Vinata, for<br>Ananta's help.'"<br><br>So ends the thirty-sixth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.
