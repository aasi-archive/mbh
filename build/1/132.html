                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then, O king, the mighty son of Bharadyaja presented<br>himself before Drupada, and addressing that monarch, said, 'Know me for<br>thy friend.' Thus addressed by his friend, the son of Bharadwaja, with a<br>joyous heart, the lord of the Panchalas was ill-able to bear that speech.<br>The king, intoxicated with the pride of wealth, contracted his brows in<br>wrath, and with reddened eyes spake these words unto Drona, 'O Brahmana,<br>thy intelligence is scarcely of a high order, inasmuch as thou sayest<br>unto me, all on a sudden, that thou art my friend! O thou of dull<br>apprehension, great kings can never be friends with such luckless and<br>indigent wights as thou! It is true there had been friendship between<br>thee and me before, for we were then both equally circumstanced. But Time<br>that impaireth everything in its course, impaireth friendship also. In<br>this world, friendship never endureth for ever in any heart. Time weareth<br>it off and anger destroyeth it too. Do not stick, therefore, to that<br>worn-off friendship. Think not of it any longer. The friendship I had<br>with thee, O first of Brahmanas, was for a particular purpose. Friendship<br>can never subsist between a poor man and a rich man, between a man of<br>letters and an unlettered mind, between a hero and a coward. Why dost<br>thou desire the continuance of our former friendship? There may be<br>friendship or hostility between persons equally situated as to wealth or<br>might. The indigent and the affluent can neither be friends nor quarrel<br>with each other. One of impure birth can never be a friend to one of pure<br>birth; one who is not a car-warrior can never be a friend to one who is<br>so; and one who is not a king never have a king for his friend.<br>Therefore, why dost thou desire the continuance of our former friendship?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by Drupada, the mighty son of<br>Bharadwaja became filled with wrath, and reflecting for a moment, made up<br>his mind as to his course of action. Seeing the insolence of the Panchala<br>king, he wished to check it effectually. Hastily leaving the Panchala<br>capital Drona bent his steps towards the capital of the Kurus, named<br>after the elephant.'"
