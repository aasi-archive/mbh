                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Ashtaka asked, 'Who amongst these, O king, both exerting constantly like<br>the Sun and the Moon, first attaineth to communion with Brahma, the<br>ascetic or the man of knowledge?'<br><br>"Yayati answered, 'The wise, with the help of the Vedas and of Knowledge,<br>having ascertained the visible universe to be illusory, instantly<br>realises the Supreme Spirit as the sole existent independent essence.<br>While they that devote themselves to Yoga meditation take time to acquire<br>the same knowledge, for it is by practice alone that these latter divest<br>themselves of the consciousness of quality. Hence the wise attain to<br>salvation first. Then again if the person devoted to Yoga find not<br>sufficient time in one life to attain success, being led astray by the<br>attractions of the world, in his next life he is benefited by the<br>progress already achieved, for he devoteth himself regretfully to the<br>pursuit of success. But the man of knowledge ever beholdeth the<br>indestructible unity, and, is, therefore, though steeped in worldly<br>enjoyments, never affected by them at heart. Therefore, there is nothing<br>to impede his salvation. He, however, who faileth to attain to knowledge,<br>should yet devote himself to piety as dependent on action (sacrifices<br>&c.). But he that devoteth himself to such piety, moved thereto by desire<br>of salvation, can never achieve success. His sacrifices bear no fruit and<br>partake of the nature of cruelty. Piety which is dependent on action that<br>proceedeth not from the desire of fruit, is, in case of such men Yoga<br>itself.'<br><br>"Ashtaka said, 'O king, thou lookest like a young man; thou art handsome<br>and decked with a celestial garland. Thy splendour is great! Whence dost<br>thou come and where dost thou go? Whose messenger art thou? Art thou<br>going down into the Earth?'<br><br>"Yayati said, 'Fallen from heaven upon the loss of all my religious<br>merits, I am doomed to enter the Earth-hell. Indeed, I shall go there<br>after I have finished my discourse with you. Even now the regents of the<br>points of the universe command me to hasten thither. And, O king, I have<br>obtained it as a boon from Indra that though fall I must upon the earth,<br>yet I should fall amidst the wise and the virtuous. Ye are all wise and<br>virtuous that are assembled here.'<br><br>"Ashtaka said, 'Thou art acquainted with everything. I ask thee, O king,<br>are there any regions for myself to enjoy in heaven or in the firmament?<br>If there be, then, thou shalt not fall, though falling.'<br><br>"Yayati answered, 'O king, there are as many regions for thee to enjoy in<br>heaven even as the number of kine and horses on Earth with the animals in<br>the wilderness and on the hills.'<br><br>"Ashtaka said, 'If there are worlds for me to enjoy, as fruits of my<br>religious merits, in heaven, O king, I give them all unto thee.<br>Therefore, though falling, thou shalt not fall. O, take thou soon all<br>those, wherever they be, in heaven or in the firmament. Let thy sorrow<br>cease.'<br><br>"Yayati answered, 'O best of kings, a Brahma-knowing Brahmana alone can<br>take in gift, but not one like ourselves. And, O monarch, I myself have<br>given away to Brahmanas as one should. Let no man who, is not a Brahmana<br>and let not the wife of a learned Brahmana ever live in infamy by<br>accepting gifts. While on earth, I ever desired to perform virtuous acts.<br>Having never done so before, how shall I now accept a gift?'<br><br>"Pratardana who was amongst them asked, 'O thou of the handsomest form, I<br>am Pratardana by name. I ask thee if there are any worlds for me to enjoy<br>as fruits of my religious merits, in heaven or the firmament? Answer me,<br>thou art acquainted with everything.'<br><br>"Yayati said, 'O king, numberless worlds, full of felicity, effulgent<br>like the solar disc, and where woe can never dwell, await thee. If thou<br>dwellest in each but for seven days, they would not yet be exhausted.'<br><br>"Pratardana said, 'These then I give unto thee. Therefore, though<br>falling, thou must not fall. Let the worlds that are mine be thine,<br>whether they be in the firmament or heaven. O, soon take them. Let thy<br>woes cease.'<br><br>"Yayati answered, 'O monarch, no king of equal energy should ever desire<br>to receive as gift the religious merits of another king acquired by Yoga<br>austerities. And no king who is afflicted with calamity through the fates<br>should, if wise, act in a censurable way. A king keeping his eye fixed<br>for ever on virtue should walk along the path of virtue like myself and,<br>knowing what his duties are, should not act so meanly as thou directest.<br>When others desirous of acquiring religious merits do not accept gifts,<br>how can I do what they themselves do not? On the conclusion of this<br>speech, that best of kings, Yayati, was then addressed by Vasumat in the<br>following words.'"
