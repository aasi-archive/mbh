                            (Jatugriha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then, when the night had passed away, a large<br>concourse of the townspeople came there in haste to see the sons of<br>Pandu. After extinguishing the fire, they saw that the house just burnt<br>down had been built of lac in materials and that (Duryodhana's)<br>counsellor Purochana had been burnt to death. And the people began to<br>bewail aloud saying, 'Indeed, this had been contrived by the sinful<br>Duryodhana for the destruction of the Pandavas. There is little doubt<br>that Duryodhana hath, with Dhritarashtra's knowledge, burnt to death the<br>heirs of Pandu, else the prince would have been prevented by his father.<br>There is little doubt that even Bhishma, the son of Santanu, and Drona<br>and Vidura and Kripa and other Kauravas have not, any of them, followed<br>the dictates of duty. Let us now send to Dhritarashtra to say, 'Thy great<br>desire hath been achieved! Thou hast burnt to death the Pandavas!'<br><br>"They then began to extinguish the members to obtain some trace of the<br>Pandavas, and they saw the innocent Nishada woman with her five sons<br>burnt to death. Then the miner sent by Vidura, while removing the ashes,<br>covered the hole he had dug with those ashes in such a way that it<br>remained unnoticed by all who had gone there.<br><br>"The citizens then sent to Dhritarashtra to inform him that the Pandavas<br>along with (Duryodhana's) counsellor Purochana had been burnt to death.<br>King Dhritarashtra, on hearing the evil news of the death of the<br>Pandavas, wept in great sorrow. And he said, 'King Pandu, my brother of<br>great fame, hath, indeed, died today when those heroic sons of his<br>together with their mother have been burnt to death. Ye men, repair<br>quickly to Varanavata and cause the funeral rites to be performed of<br>those heroes and of the daughter of Kuntiraj! Let also the bones of the<br>deceased be sanctified with the usual rites, and let all the beneficial<br>and great acts (usual on such occasions) be performed. Let the friends<br>and relatives of those that have been burnt to death repair thither. Let<br>also all other beneficial acts that ought, under the circumstances, to be<br>performed by us for the Pandavas and Kunti be accomplished by wealth.'<br><br>"Having said this, Dhritarashtra, the son of Ambika, surrounded by his<br>relatives, offered oblations of water to the sons of Pandu. And all of<br>them, afflicted with excessive sorrow, bewailed aloud, exclaiming, 'O<br>Yudhishthira! Oh prince of the Kuru race!'&#8212;While others cried aloud,<br>'Oh, Bhima!&#8212;O Phalguna!'&#8212;while some again,&#8212;'Oh, the twins!&#8212;Oh,<br>Kunti!'&#8212;Thus did they sorrow for the Pandavas and offer oblations of<br>water unto them. The citizens also wept for the Pandavas but Vidura did<br>not weep much, because he knew the truth.<br><br>"Meanwhile the Pandavas endued with great strength with their mother<br>forming a company of six going out of the town of Varanavata arrived at<br>the banks of the Ganga. They then speedily reached the opposite bank<br>aided by the strength of the boatmen's arms, the rapidity of the river's<br>current, and a favourable wind. Leaving the boat, they proceeded in the<br>southern direction finding their way in the dark by the light of the<br>stars. After much suffering they at last reached, O king, a dense forest.<br>They were then tired and thirsty; sleep was closing their eyes every<br>moment. Then Yudhishthira, addressing Bhima endued with great energy,<br>said, 'What can be more painful than this? We are now in the deep woods.<br>We know not which side is which, nor can we proceed much further. We do<br>not know whether that wretch Purochana hath or hath not been burnt to<br>death. How shall we escape from these dangers unseen by others? O<br>Bharata, taking us on thyself, proceed thou as before. Thou alone amongst<br>us art strong and swift as the wind.'<br><br>"Thus addressed by Yudhishthira the just, the mighty Bhimasena, taking up<br>on his body Kunti and his brothers, began to proceed with great<br>celerity.'"
