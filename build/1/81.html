                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>Vaisampayana said, 'After some length of time, O best of monarchs,<br>Devayani of the fairest complexion went into the same woods for purposes<br>of pleasure. And accompanied by Sarmishtha with her thousand maids she<br>reached the same spot and began to wander freely. And waited upon by all<br>those companions she felt supremely happy. And sporting with light<br>hearts, they began drinking the honey in flowers, eating various kinds of<br>fruit and biting some. And just at that time, king Yayati, the son of<br>Nahusha, again came there tired and thirsty, in course of his wanderings,<br>in search of deer. And the king saw Devayani and Sarmishtha, and those<br>other maidens also, all decked with celestial ornaments and full of<br>voluptuous languor in consequence of the flower-honey they drank. And<br>Devayani of sweet smiles, unrivalled for beauty and possessed of the<br>fairest complexion amongst them all, was reclining at her ease. And she<br>was waited upon by Sarmishtha who was gently kneading her feet.<br><br>"And Yayati seeing all this, said, 'O amiable ones, I would ask you both<br>your names and parentage. It seems that these two thousand maids wait on<br>you two.' 'Hearing the monarch, Devayani then answered, 'Listen to me, O<br>best of men. Know that I am the daughter of Sukra, the spiritual guide of<br>the Asuras. This my companion is my waiting-maid. She attendeth on me<br>wherever I go. She is Sarmishtha, the daughter of the Asura king<br>Vrishaparvan.'<br><br>"Yayati then asked, 'I am curious to know why is this thy companion of<br>fair eye-brows, this maiden of the fairest complexion, the daughter of<br>the Asura chief thy waiting-maid!' Devayani replied, 'O best of king,<br>everything resulteth from Fate. Knowing this also to be the result of<br>Fate, wonder not at it. Thy feature and attire are both like a king's.<br>Thy speech also is fair and correct as that of the Vedas. Tell me thy<br>name, whence thou art and whose son also.'<br><br>"The monarch replied, 'During my vow of Brahmacharya, the whole Vedas<br>entered my ears. I am known as Yayati, a king's son and myself a king.'<br>Devayani then enquired, 'O king, what hast thou come here for? Is it to<br>gather lotuses or to angle or to hunt?' Yayati said, 'O amiable one,<br>thirsty from the pursuit of deer, I have come hither in search of water.<br>I am very much fatigued. I await but your commands to leave this spot.'<br><br>"Devayani answered, 'With my two thousand damsels and my waiting-maid<br>Sarmishtha, I wait but your commands. Prosperity to thee. Be thou my<br>friend and lord.'<br><br>"Yayati, thereupon, replied, 'Beautiful one, I do not deserve thee. Thou<br>art the daughter of Sukra far superior to me. Thy father cannot bestow<br>thee even on a great king.' To this Devayani replied, 'Brahmanas had<br>before this been united with the Kshatriyas, and Kshatriyas with<br>Brahmanas. Thou art the son of a Rishi and thyself a Rishi. Therefore, O<br>son of Nahusha, marry me.' Yayati, however, replied, 'O thou of the<br>handsomest features, the four orders have, indeed, sprung from one body.<br>But their duties and purity are not the same, the Brahmana being truly<br>superior to all.' Devayani answered, 'This hand of mine hath never been<br>touched before by any man save thee. Therefore, do I accept thee for my<br>lord. How, indeed, shall any other man touch my hand which had before<br>been touched by thyself who art a Rishi? Yayati then said, 'The wise know<br>that a Brahmana is more to be avoided than an angry snake of virulent<br>poison, or a blazing fire of spreading flames.' Devayani then told the<br>monarch, 'O bull amongst men, why dost thou, indeed, say that Brahmana<br>should be more avoided than an angry snake of virulent poison or a<br>blazing fire of spreading flames?' The monarch answered, 'The snake<br>killeth only one. The sharpest weapon slayeth but a single person. The<br>Brahmana, when angry destroyeth whole cities and kingdoms! Therefore, O<br>timid one, do I deem a Brahmana as more to be avoided than either. I<br>cannot hence wed thee, O amiable one, unless thy father bestoweth thee on<br>me. Devayani then said, 'Thou art, indeed, chosen by me. And, O king, it<br>is understood that thou wilt accept me if my father bestoweth me on thee.<br>Thou needst not fear to accept my poor self bestowed on thee. Thou dost<br>not, indeed, ask for me.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'After this, Devayani quickly sent a maidservant<br>to her father. The maid represented to Sukra everything as it had<br>happened. And as soon as he had heard all, Bhargava came and saw Yayati.<br>And beholding Bhargava come, Yayati worshipped and adored that Brahmana,<br>and stood with joined palms in expectation of his commands.'<br><br>"And Devayani then said, 'This O father, is the son of Nahusha. He took<br>hold of my hand, when I was in distress. I bow to thee. Bestow me upon<br>him. I shall not wed any other person in the world.' Sukra exclaimed, 'O<br>thou of splendid courage, thou hast, indeed, been accepted as her lord by<br>this my dear daughter. I bestow her on thee. Therefore, O son of Nahusha,<br>accept her as thy wife.'<br><br>"Yayati then said, 'I solicit the boon, O Brahmana, that by so doing, the<br>sin of begetting a half-breed might not touch me.' Sukra, however,<br>assured him by saying, 'I shall absolve thee from the sin. Ask thou the<br>boon that thou desirest. Fear not to wed her. I grant thee absolution.<br>Maintain virtuously thy wife&#8212;the slender-waisted Devayani. Transports of<br>happiness be thine in her company. This other maiden, Vrishaparvan's<br>daughter, Sarmishtha should ever be regarded by thee. But thou shall not<br>summon her to thy bed.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by Sukra, Yayati then walked<br>round the Brahmana. And the king then went through the auspicious<br>ceremony of marriage according to the rites of the scriptures. And having<br>received from Sukra this rich treasure of the excellent Devayani with<br>Sarmishtha and those two thousand maidens, and duly honoured also by<br>Sukra himself and the Asuras, the best of monarchs, then, commanded by<br>the high-souled Bhargava, returned to his capital with a joyous heart.'"
