                            (Chaitraratha Parva continued)<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'When that maiden disappeared, that feller of<br>hostile ranks deprived of his senses by Kama (concupiscence) himself fell<br>down on the earth. And as the monarch fell down, that maiden of sweet<br>smiles and prominent and round hips appeared again before him, and<br>smiling sweetly, said unto that perpetuator of Kuru's race these honeyed<br>words, 'Rise, rise, O chastiser of foes! Blest be thou; it behoveth thee<br>not, O tiger among kings, to lose thy reason, a celebrated man as thou<br>art in the world.' Addressed in these honeyed words, the king opened his<br>eyes and saw before him that selfsame girl of swelling hips. The monarch<br>who was burning with the flame of desire then addressed that black-eyed<br>damsel in accents, weak with emotion, and said, 'Blest be thou O<br>excellent woman of black eyes! As I am burning with desire and paying<br>thee court, O, accept me! My life is ebbing away. O thou of large eyes,<br>for thy sake it is, O thou of the splendour of the filaments of the<br>lotus, that Kama is incessantly piercing me with his keen shafts without<br>stopping for a moment! O amiable and cheerful girl, I have been bitten by<br>Kama who is even like a venomous viper. O thou of swelling and large<br>hips, have mercy on me! O thou of handsome and faultless features, O thou<br>of face like unto the lotus-petal or the moon, O thou of voice sweet as<br>that of singing Kinnaras, my life now depends on thee! Without thee, O<br>timid one, I am unable to live! O thou of eyes like lotus-petals, Kama is<br>piercing me incessantly! O large-eyed girl, be merciful unto me! It<br>becometh thee not, O black-eyed maid, to cast me off; O handsome girl, it<br>behoveth thee to relieve me from such affliction by giving me thy love!<br>At first sight thou hast attracted my heart. My mind wandereth! Beholding<br>thee I like not to cast my eyes on any other woman! Be merciful! I am thy<br>obedient slave&#8212;thy adorer! O, accept me! O beautiful lady, O large-eyed<br>girl at the sight of thee, the god of desire hath entered my heart, and<br>is piercing me with his shafts! O thou of lotus-eyes, the flame of desire<br>burneth within me! O, extinguish that flame with the water of thy love<br>poured on it! O beautiful lady, by becoming mine, pacify thou the<br>irrepressible god of desire that hath appeared here armed with his deadly<br>bow and arrows and that is piercing me incessantly with those keen shafts<br>of his! O thou of the fairest complexion, wed me according to the<br>Gandharva form, for, O thou of tapering hips, of all forms of marriage<br>the Gandharva hath been said to be the best.'<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'Hearing those words of the monarch, Tapati<br>made answer, 'O king, I am not the mistress of my own self! Be it known<br>that I am a maiden under the control of my father. If thou really<br>entertainest an affection for me, demand me of my father. Thou sayest, O<br>king, that thy heart hath been robbed by me. But thou also hast, at first<br>sight, robbed me of my heart; I am not the mistress of my body, and<br>therefore, O best of kings, I do not approach thee; women are never<br>independent. What girl is there in the three worlds that would not desire<br>thee for her husband, as thou art kind unto all thy dependents and as<br>thou art born in a pure race? Therefore, when the opportunity comes, ask<br>my father Aditya for my hand with worship, ascetic penances, and vows. If<br>my father bestoweth me upon thee, then, O king, I shall ever be thy<br>obedient wife. My name is Tapati and I am the younger sister of Savitri,<br>and the daughter, O bull amongst Kshatriyas of Savitri, of (Sun) the<br>illuminator of the universe.'"
