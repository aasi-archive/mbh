                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'The monarch then, as he proceeded, left even his<br>reduced retinue at the entrance of the hermitage. And entering quite<br>alone he saw not the Rishi (Kanwa) of rigid vows. And not seeing the<br>Rishi and finding that the abode was empty, he called loudly, saying,<br>'What ho, who is here?' And the sound of his voice was echoed back. And<br>hearing the sound of his voice, there came out of the Rishi's abode a<br>maiden beautiful as Sri herself but dressed as an ascetic's daughter. And<br>the black-eyed fair one, as she saw king Dushmanta, bade him welcome and<br>received him duly. And, showing him due respect by the offer of a seat,<br>water to wash his feet, and Arghya, she enquired about the monarch's<br>health and peace. And having worshipped the king and asked him about his<br>health and peace, the maiden reverentially asked, 'What must be done, O<br>king! I await your commands.' The king, duly worshipped by her, said unto<br>that maiden of faultless features and sweet speech, 'I have come to<br>worship the highly-blessed Rishi Kanwa. Tell me, O amiable and beautiful<br>one, where has the illustrious Rishi gone?'<br><br>"Sakuntala then answered, 'My illustrious father hath gone away from the<br>asylum to fetch fruit. Wait but a moment and thou wilt see him when he<br>arrives.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The king not seeing the Rishi and addressed<br>thus by her, beheld that the maiden was exceedingly beautiful and endued<br>with perfect symmetry of shape. And he saw that she was of sweet smiles.<br>And she stood decked with the beauty of her faultless features, her<br>ascetic penances, and her humility. And he saw that she was in the bloom<br>of youth. He therefore asked her, 'Who art thou? And whose daughter, O<br>beautiful one? Why hast thou come into the woods also? O handsome one,<br>gifted with so much beauty and such virtues, whence hast thou come? O<br>charming one, at the very first glance hast thou stolen my heart! I<br>desire to learn all about thee; therefore tell me all.' And thus<br>addressed by the monarch, the maiden smilingly replied in these sweet<br>words, 'O Dushmanta, I am the daughter of the virtuous, wise,<br>high-souled, and illustrious ascetic Kanwa.'<br><br>"Dushmanta, hearing this, replied, 'The universally-worshipped and<br>highly-blessed Rishi is one whose seed hath been drawn up. Even Dharma<br>himself might fall off from his course but an ascetic of rigid vows can<br>never fall off so. Therefore, O thou of the fairest complexion, how hast<br>thou been born as his daughter? This great doubt of mine it behoveth thee<br>to dispel.'<br><br>"Sakuntala then replied, 'Hear, O king, what I have learnt regarding all<br>that befell me of old and how I became the daughter of the Muni. Once on<br>a time, a Rishi came here and asked about my birth. All that the<br>illustrious one (Kanwa) told him, hear now from me, O king!<br><br>"My father Kanwa, in answer to that Rishi's enquiries, said, 'Viswamitra,<br>of old, having been engaged in the austerest penances alarmed Indra, the<br>chief of the celestials, who thought that the mighty ascetic of blazing<br>energy would, by his penances, hurl him down from his high seat in<br>heaven.' Indra, thus alarmed, summoned Menaka and told her, 'Thou, O<br>Menaka, art the first of celestial Apsaras. Therefore, O amiable one, do<br>me this service. Hear what I say. This great ascetic Viswamitra like unto<br>the Sun in splendour, is engaged in the most severe of penances. My heart<br>is trembling with fear. Indeed, O slender-waisted Menaka, this is thy<br>business. Thou must see that Viswamitra of soul rapt in contemplation and<br>engaged in the austerest penances, who might hurl me down from my seat.<br>Go and tempt him and frustrating his continued austerities accomplish my<br>good. Win him away from his penances, O beautiful one, by tempting him<br>with thy beauty, youth, agreeableness, arts, smiles and speech.' Hearing<br>all this, Menaka replied, 'The illustrious Viswamitra is endued with<br>great energy and is a mighty ascetic. He is very short-tempered too, as<br>is known to thee. The energy, penances, and wrath of the high-souled one<br>have made even thee anxious. Why should I not also be anxious? He it was<br>who made even the illustrious Vasishtha bear the pangs of witnessing the<br>premature death of his children. He it was who, though at first born as<br>Kshatriya, subsequently became a Brahmana by virtue of his ascetic<br>penances. He it was who, for purposes of his ablutions, created a deep<br>river that can with difficulty be forded, and which sacred stream is<br>known by the name of the Kausiki. It was Viswamitra whose wife, in a<br>season of distress, was maintained by the royal sage Matanga (Trisanku)<br>who was then living under a father's curse as a hunter. It was Viswamitra<br>who, on returning after the famine was over, changed the name of the<br>stream having his asylum from Kausik into Para. It was Viswamitra who in<br>return for the services of Matanga, himself became the latter's priest<br>for purposes of a sacrifice. The lord of the celestials himself went<br>through fear to drink the Soma juice. It was Viswamitra who in anger<br>created a second world and numerous stars beginning with Sravana. He it<br>was who granted protection to Trisanku smarting under a superior's curse.<br>I am frightened to approach him of such deeds. Tell me, O Indra, the<br>means that should be adopted so that I may not be burnt by his wrath. He<br>can burn the three worlds by his splendour, can, by a stamp (of his<br>foot), cause the earth to quake. He can sever the great Meru from the<br>earth and hurl it to any distance. He can go round the ten points of the<br>earth in a moment. How can a woman like me even touch such a one full of<br>ascetic virtues, like unto a blazing fire, and having his passions under<br>complete control? His mouth is like unto a blazing fire; the pupils of<br>his eyes are like the Sun and the Moon; his tongue is like unto Yama<br>himself. How shall, O chief of the celestials, a woman like me even touch<br>him? At the thought of his prowess Yama, Soma, the great Rishis, the<br>Saddhyas, the Viswas, Valakhilyas, are terrified! How can a woman like me<br>gaze at him without alarm? Commanded, however, by thee, O king of the<br>celestials, I shall somehow approach that Rishi. But, O chief of the<br>gods, devise thou some plan whereby protected by thee, I may safely move<br>about that Rishi. I think that when I begin to play before the Rishi,<br>Marut (the god of wind) had better go there and rob me of my dress, and<br>Manmatha (the god of love) had also, at thy command, better help me then.<br>Let also Marut on that occasion bear thither fragrance from the woods to<br>tempt the Rishi.' Saying this and seeing that all she had spoken about<br>had been duly provided, Menaka went to the retreat of the great Kausika.'"
