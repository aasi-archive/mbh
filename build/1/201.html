                            (Vaivahika Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'King Drupada, after his alliance with the Pandavas,<br>had all his fears dispelled. Indeed, the monarch no longer stood in fear<br>even of the gods. The ladies of the illustrious Drupada's household<br>approached Kunti and introduced themselves unto her, mentioning their<br>respective names, and worshipped her feet with heads touching the ground.<br>Krishna also, attired in red silk and her wrists still encircled with the<br>auspicious thread, saluting her mother-in-law with reverence, stood<br>contentedly before her with joined palms. Pritha, out of affection,<br>pronounced a blessing upon her daughter-in-law endued with great beauty<br>and every auspicious mark and possessed of a sweet disposition and good<br>character, saying, 'Be thou unto thy husband as Sachi unto Indra, Swaha<br>unto Vibhavasu, Rohini unto Soma, Damayanti unto Nala, Bhadra unto<br>Vaisravana, Arundhati unto Vasishtha, Lakshmi unto Narayana! O amiable<br>one, be thou the mother of long-lived and heroic children, and possessed<br>of everything that can make thee happy! Let luck and prosperity ever wait<br>on thee! Wait thou ever on husbands engaged in the performance of grand<br>sacrifices. Be thou devoted to thy husbands. And let thy days be ever<br>passed in duly entertaining and reverencing guests and strangers arrived<br>at thy abode, and the pious and the old; children and superiors. Be thou<br>installed as the Queen of the kingdom and the capital of Kurujangala,<br>with thy husband Yudhishthira the just! O daughter, let the whole earth,<br>conquered by the prowess of thy husbands endued with great strength, be<br>given away by thee unto Brahmanas at horse-sacrifice! O accomplished one<br>whatever gems there are on earth possessed of superior virtues, obtain<br>them, O lucky one, and be thou happy for a full hundred years! And, O<br>daughter-in-law, as I rejoice today beholding thee attired in red silk,<br>so shall I rejoice again, when, O accomplished one, I behold thee become<br>the mother of a son!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'After the sons of Pandu had been married, Hari<br>(Krishna) sent unto them (as presents) various gold ornaments set with<br>pearls and black gems (lapis lazuli). And Madhava (Krishna) also sent<br>unto them costly robes manufactured in various countries, and many<br>beautiful and soft blankets and hides of great value, and many costly<br>beds and carpets and vehicles. He also sent them vessels by hundreds, set<br>with gems and diamonds. And Krishna also gave them female servants by<br>thousands, brought from various countries, and endued with beauty, youth<br>and accomplishments and decked with every ornament. He also gave them<br>many well-trained elephants brought from the country of Madra, and many<br>excellent horses in costly harness, cars drawn by horses of excellent<br>colours and large teeth. The slayer of Madhu, of immeasurable soul, also<br>sent them coins of pure gold by crores upon crores in separate heaps. And<br>Yudhishthira the just, desirous of gratifying Govinda, accepted all those<br>presents with great joy.'"
