                            (Vaka-vadha Parva continued)<br><br>'Kunti said, 'I desire to learn from you the cause of this grief, for I<br>will remove it, if possible.'<br><br>"The Brahmana replied, 'O thou of ascetic wealth, thy speech is, indeed<br>worthy of thee. But this grief is incapable of being removed by any human<br>being. Not far from this town, there liveth a Rakshasa of the name of<br>Vaka, which cannibal is the lord of this country and town. Thriving on<br>human flesh, that wretched Rakshasa endued with great strength ruleth<br>this country. He being the chief of the Asuras, this town and the country<br>in which it is situate are protected by his might. We have no fear from<br>the machinations of any enemy, or indeed from any living soul. The fee,<br>however, fixed for that cannibal is his food, which consists of a<br>cart-load of rice, two buffaloes, and a human being who conveyeth them<br>unto him. One after another, the house-holders have to send him this<br>food. The turn, however, cometh to a particular family at intervals of<br>many long years. If there are any that seek to avoid it, the Rakshasa<br>slayeth them with their children and wives and devoureth them all. There<br>is, in this country, a city called Vetrakiya, where liveth the king of<br>these territories. He is ignorant of the science of government, and<br>possessed of little intelligence, he adopts not with care any measure by<br>which these territories may be rendered safe for all time to come. But we<br>certainly deserve it all, inasmuch as we live within the dominion of that<br>wretched and weak monarch in perpetual anxiety. Brahmanas can never be<br>made to dwell permanently within the dominions of any one, for they are<br>dependent on nobody, they live rather like birds ranging all countries in<br>perfect freedom. It hath been said that one must secure a (good) king,<br>then a wife, and then wealth. It is by the acquisition of these three<br>that one can rescue his relatives and sons. But as regards the<br>acquisition of these three, the course of my actions hath been the<br>reverse. Hence, plunged into a sea of danger, am suffering sorely. That<br>turn, destructive of one's family, hath now devolved upon me. I shall<br>have to give unto the Rakshasa as his fee the food of the aforesaid<br>description and one human being to boot. I have no wealth to buy a man<br>with. I cannot by any means consent to part with any one of my family,<br>nor do I see any way of escape from (the clutches of) that Rakshasa. I am<br>now sunk in an ocean of grief from which there is no escape. I shall go<br>to that Rakshasa today, attended by all my family in order that that<br>wretch might devour us all at once'"
