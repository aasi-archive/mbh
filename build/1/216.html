                            (Arjuna-vanavasa Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'When that spreader of the renown of Kuru's race, the<br>strong-armed Arjuna, set out (for the forest), Brahmanas conversant with<br>the Vedas walked behind that illustrious hero to a certain distance.<br>Followed by Brahmanas conversant with the Vedas and their branches and<br>devoted to the contemplation of the Supreme Spirit, by persons skilled in<br>music, by ascetics devoted to the Deity, by reciters of Puranas, by<br>narrators of sacred stories by devotees leading celibate lives, by<br>Vanaprasthas, by Brahmanas sweetly reciting celestial histories, and by<br>various other classes of persons of sweet speeches, Arjuna journeyed like<br>Indra followed by the Maruts. And, O thou of Bharata's race, that bull<br>among the Bharatas saw, as he journeyed, many delightful and picturesque<br>forests, lakes, rivers, seas, provinces, and waters. At length, on<br>arriving at the source of the Ganges the mighty hero thought of settling<br>there.<br><br>"Listen now, O Janamejaya, to a wonderful feat which that foremost of the<br>sons of Pandu, of high soul, did, while living there. When that son of<br>Kunti, O Bharata, and the Brahmanas who had followed him, took up their<br>residence in that region, the latter performed innumerable Agnihotras<br>(sacrificial rites by igniting the sacred fire). And, O king, in<br>consequence of those learned vow-observing, and illustrious Brahmanas,<br>who never deviated from the right path, daily establishing and igniting<br>with mantras on the banks of that sacred stream, after the performance of<br>their ablutions, fires for their sacrifices, and pouring libations of<br>clarified butter into the same, and worshipping those fires with<br>offerings of flowers, that region itself where the Ganges entered the<br>plains became exceedingly beautiful. One day that bull amongst the<br>Pandavas, while residing in that region in the midst of those Brahmanas,<br>descended (as usual) into the Ganges to perform his ablutions. After his<br>ablutions had been over, and after he had offered oblations of water unto<br>his deceased ancestors, he was about to get up from the stream to perform<br>his sacrificial rites before the fire, when the mighty-armed hero, O<br>king, was dragged into the bottom of the water by Ulupi, the daughter of<br>the king of the Nagas, urged by the god of desire. And it so happened<br>that the son of Pandu was carried into the beautiful mansion of Kauravya,<br>the king of the Nagas. Arjuna saw there a sacrificial fire ignited for<br>himself. Beholding that fire, Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti performed his<br>sacrificial rites with devotion. And Agni was much gratified with Arjuna<br>for the fearlessness with which that hero had poured libations into his<br>manifest form. After he had thus performed his rites before the fire, the<br>son of Kunti, beholding the daughter of the king of the Nagas, addressed<br>her smilingly and said, 'O handsome girl, what an act of rashness hast<br>thou done. O timid one! Whose is this beautiful region, who art thou and<br>whose daughter?'<br><br>"Hearing these words of Arjuna, Ulupi answered, 'There is a Naga of the<br>name of Kauravya, born in the line of Airavata. I am, O prince, the<br>daughter of that Kauravya, and my name is Ulupi. O tiger among men,<br>beholding thee descend into the stream to perform thy ablutions, I was<br>deprived of reason by the god of desire. O sinless one, I am still<br>unmarried. Afflicted as I am by the god of desire on account of thee, O<br>thou of Kuru's race, gratify me today by giving thyself up to me.'<br><br>"Arjuna replied, 'Commanded by king Yudhishthira, O amiable one, I am<br>undergoing the vow of Brahmacharin for twelve years. I am not free to act<br>in any way I like. But, O ranger of the waters, I am still willing to do<br>thy pleasure (if I can). I have never spoken an untruth in my life. Tell<br>me, therefore, O Naga maid, how I may act so that, while doing thy<br>pleasure, I may not be guilty of any untruth or breach of duty.'<br><br>"Ulupi answered, 'I know, O son of Pandu, why thou wanderest over the<br>earth, and why thou hast been commanded to lead the life of a<br>Brahmacharin by the superior. Even this was the understanding to which<br>all of you had been pledged, viz., that amongst you all owning Drupada's<br>daughter as your common wife, he who would from ignorance enter the room<br>where one of you would be sitting with her, should lead the life of a<br>Brahmacharin in the woods for twelve years. The exile of any one amongst<br>you, therefore, is only for the sake of Draupadi. Thou art but observing<br>the duty arising from that vow. Thy virtue cannot sustain any diminution<br>(by acceding to my solicitation). Then again, O thou of large eyes, it is<br>a duty to relieve the distressed. Thy virtue suffereth no diminution by<br>relieving me. Oh, if (by this act), O Arjuna, thy virtue doth suffer a<br>small diminution, thou wilt acquire great merit by saving my life. Know<br>me for thy worshipper, O Partha! Therefore, yield thyself up to me! Even<br>this, O lord, is the opinion of the wise (viz., that one should accept a<br>woman that wooeth). If thou do not act in this way, know that I will<br>destroy myself. O thou of mighty arms, earn great merit by saving my<br>life. I seek thy shelter, O best of men! Thou protectest always, O son of<br>Kunti, the afflicted and the masterless. I seek thy protection, weeping<br>in sorrow. I woo thee, being filled with desire. Therefore, do what is<br>agreeable to me. It behoveth thee to gratify my wish by yielding thy self<br>up to me.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed by the daughter of the king of the<br>Nagas, the son of Kunti did everything she desired, making virtue his<br>motive. The mighty Arjuna, spending the night in the mansion of the Naga<br>rose with the sun in the morning. Accompanied by Ulupi he came back from<br>the palace of Kauravya to the region where the Ganges entereth the<br>plains. The chaste Ulupi, taking her leave there, returned to her own<br>abode. And, O Bharata, she granted unto Arjuna a boon making him<br>invincible in water, saying, 'Every amphibious creature shall, without<br>doubt, be vanquishable by thee.'"
