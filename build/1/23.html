                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Having crossed the Ocean, Kadru of swift speed, accompanied<br>by Vinata, soon alighted near the horse. They then both beheld that<br>foremost of steeds of great speed, with body white as the rays of the<br>moon but having black hairs (in the tail). And observing many black hairs<br>in the tail, Kadru put Vinata, who was deeply dejected, into slavery. And<br>thus Vinata having lost the wager, entered into a state of slavery and<br>became exceedingly sorry.<br><br>"In the meantime, when his time came, burst forth from the egg without<br>(the help of his) mother, Garuda of great splendour, enkindling all the<br>points of the universe, that mighty being endued with strength, that bird<br>capable of assuming at will any form, of going at will everywhere, and of<br>calling to his aid at will any measure of energy. Effulgent like a heap<br>of fire, he shone terribly. Of lustre equal to that of the fire at the<br>end of the Yuga, his eyes were bright like the lightning-flash. And soon<br>after birth, that bird grew in size and increasing his body ascended the<br>skies. Fierce and vehemently roaring, he looked as terrible as second<br>Ocean-fire. And all the deities seeing him, sought the protection of<br>Vibhavasu (Agni). And they bowed down to that deity of manifold forms<br>seated on his seat and spake unto him these words, 'O Agni, extend not<br>thy body! Wilt thou consume us? Lo, this huge heap of thy flames is<br>spreading wide!' And Agni replied, 'O, ye persecutors of the Asuras, it<br>is not as ye imagine. This is Garuda of great strength and equal to me in<br>splendour, endued with great energy, and born to promote the joy of<br>Vinata. Even the sight of this heap of effulgence hath caused this<br>delusion in you. He is the mighty son of Kasyapa, the destroyer of the<br>Nagas, engaged in the well-being of the gods, and the foe of the Daityas<br>and the Rakshasas. Be not afraid of it in the least. Come with me and<br>see.' Thus addressed, the gods from a distance.<br><br>"The gods said, 'Thou art a Rishi (i.e., one cognisant of all mantras),<br>share of the largest portion in sacrifices, ever resplendent, the<br>controller along with the Rishi wended their way towards Garuda and<br>adored him of birds, the presiding spirit of the animate and the<br>inanimate universe. Thou art the destroyer of all, the creator of all;<br>thou art the very Hiranyagarbha; thou art the progenitor of creation in<br>the form of Daksha and the other Prajapatis; thou art Indra (the king of<br>the gods), thou art Hayagriva the steed necked incarnation of Vishnu;<br>thou art the arrow (Vishnu himself, as he became such in the hands of<br>Mahadeva at the burning of Tripura); thou art the lord of the universe;<br>thou art the mouth of Vishnu; thou art the four-faced Padmaja; thou art<br>the Brahmana (i.e., wise), thou art Agni, Pavana, etc. (i.e., the<br>presiding deity of every object in the universe). Thou art knowledge,<br>thou art the illusion to which we are all subject; thou art the<br>all-pervading spirit; thou art the lord of the gods; thou art the great<br>Truth; thou art fearless; thou art ever unchanged; thou art Brahma<br>without attributes; thou art the energy of the Sun; thou art the<br>intellectual functions; thou art our great protector; thou art the ocean<br>of holiness; thou art purity; thou art bereft of the attributes of<br>darkness; thou art the possessor of the six high attributes; thou art he<br>who cannot be withstood in contest. From thee have emanated all things;<br>thou art of excellent deeds; thou art all that hath not been and all that<br>hath been. Thou art pure knowledge; thou displayest to us, as Surya does<br>by his rays, this animate and inanimate universe; thou darkenest the<br>splendour of Surya at every moment, and thou art the destroyer of all;<br>thou art all that is perishable and all that is imperishable. O thou<br>resplendent as Agni, thou burnest all even as Surya in his anger burneth<br>all creatures. O terrible one, thou resistest even as the fire that<br>destroys everything at the time of the Universal Dissolution. O mighty<br>Garuda who movest in the skies, we seek thy protection. O lord of birds<br>thy energy is extraordinary, thy splendour is that of fire, thy<br>brightness is like that of the lightning that no darkness can approach.<br>Thou reachest the very clouds, and art both the cause and the effect; the<br>dispenser of boons and invincible in prowess. O Lord, this whole universe<br>is rendered hot by thy splendour, bright as the lustre of heated gold.<br>Protect these high-souled gods, who overcome by thee and terrified<br>withal, are flying along the heavens in different directions on their<br>celestial cars. O thou best of birds, thou Lord of all, thou art the son<br>of the merciful and high-souled Rishi Kasyapa; therefore, be not wroth<br>but have mercy on the universe. Thou art Supreme. O pacify thy anger and<br>preserve us. At thy voice, loud as the roar of the thunder, the ten<br>points, the skies, the heavens, the Earth and our hearts, O bird, thou<br>art continuously shaking. O, diminish this thy body resembling Agni. At<br>the sight of the splendour resembling that of Yama when in wrath, our<br>hearts lose all equanimity and quake. O thou lord of birds, be propitious<br>to us who solicit thy mercy! O illustrious one, bestow on us good fortune<br>and joy.'<br><br>And that bird of fair feathers, thus adored by the deities and diverse<br>sections of Rishis, reduced his own energy and splendour.'"<br><br>And thus ends the twenty-third section in the Astika Parva of the Adi<br>Parva.
