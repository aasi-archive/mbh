                            (Chaitraratha Parva continued)<br><br>"Arjuna asked, 'O Gandharva, thou art acquainted with everything. Tell<br>us, therefore, which Veda-knowing Brahmana is worthy to be appointed as<br>our priest.'<br><br>"The Gandharva replied, 'There is in these woods a shrine of the name of<br>Utkochaka. Dhaumya, the younger brother of Devala is engaged there in<br>ascetic penances. Appoint him, if ye desire, your priest."<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then Arjuna, highly pleased with everything that had<br>happened, gave unto that Gandharva, his weapon of fire with befitting<br>ceremonies. And addressing him, the Pandava also said, 'O thou best of<br>Gandharvas, let the horses thou givest us remain with thee for a time.<br>When the occasion cometh, we will take them from thee. Blest be thou.'<br>Then the Gandharva and the Pandavas, respectfully saluting each other,<br>left the delightful banks of the Bhagirathi and went wheresoever they<br>desired. Then, O Bharata, the Pandavas going to Utkochaka, the sacred<br>asylum of Dhaumya installed Dhaumya as their priest. And Dhaumya, the<br>foremost of all conversant with the Vedas, receiving them with presents<br>of wild fruits and (edible) roots, consented to become their priest. And<br>the Pandavas with their mother forming the sixth of the company, having<br>obtained that Brahmana as their priest regarded their sovereignty and<br>kingdom as already regained and the daughter of the Panchala king as<br>already obtained in the Swayamavara. And those bulls of the Bharata race,<br>having obtained the master Dhaumya as their priest, also regarded<br>themselves as placed under a powerful protector. And the high-souled<br>Dhaumya, acquainted with the true meaning of the Vedas and every rule of<br>morality, becoming the spiritual preceptor of the virtuous Pandavas, made<br>them his Yajamanas (spiritual disciples). And that Brahmana, beholding<br>those heroes endued with intelligence and strength and perseverance like<br>unto the celestials, regarded them as already restored, by virtue of<br>their own accomplishments to their sovereignty and kingdom. Then those<br>kings of men, having had benedictions uttered upon them by that Brahmana,<br>resolved to go, accompanied by him, to the Swayamvara of the Princess of<br>Panchala.'"
