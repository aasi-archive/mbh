                            (Pauloma Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'While those illustrious Brahmanas were sitting around the<br>dead body of Pramadvara, Ruru, sorely afflicted, retired into a deep wood<br>and wept aloud. And overwhelmed with grief he indulged in much piteous<br>lamentation. And, remembering his beloved Pramadvara, he gave vent to his<br>sorrow in the following words, 'Alas! The delicate fair one that<br>increaseth my affliction lieth upon the bare ground. What can be more<br>deplorable to us, her friends? If I have been charitable, if I have<br>performed acts of penance, if I have ever revered my superiors, let the<br>merit of these arts restore to life my beloved one! If from my birth I<br>have been controlling my passions, adhered to my vows, let the fair<br>Pramadvara rise from the ground.<br><br>"And while Ruru was indulging in these lamentations for the loss of his<br>bride, a messenger from heaven came to him in the forest and addressed<br>him thus, 'The words thou utterest, O Ruru, in thy affliction are<br>certainly ineffectual. For, O pious man, one belonging to this world<br>whose days have run out can never come back to life. This poor child of a<br>Gandharva and Apsara has had her days run out! Therefore, O child, thou<br>shouldst not consign thy heart to sorrow. The great gods, however, have<br>provided beforehand a means of her restoration to life. And if thou<br>compliest with it, thou mayest receive back thy Pramadvara.'<br><br>"And Ruru replied, O messenger of heaven! What is that which the gods<br>have ordained. Tell me in full so that (on hearing) I may comply with it.<br>It behoveth thee to deliver me from grief!' And the celestial messenger<br>said unto Ruru, 'Resign half of thy own life to thy bride, and then, O<br>Ruru of the race of Bhrigu, thy Pramadvara shall rise from the ground.'<br>'O best of celestial messengers, I most willingly offer a moiety of my<br>own life in favour of my bride. Then let my beloved one rise up once more<br>in her dress and lovable form.'<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Then the king of Gandharvas (the father of Pramadvara) and<br>the celestial messenger, both of excellent qualities, went to the god<br>Dharma (the Judge of the dead) and addressed him, saying, 'If it be thy<br>will, O Dharmaraja, let the amiable Pramadvara, the betrothed wife of<br>Ruru, now lying dead, rise up with a moiety of Ruru's life.' And<br>Dharmaraja answered, 'O messenger of the gods, if it be thy wish, let<br>Pramadvara, the betrothed wife of Ruru, rise up endued with a moiety of<br>Ruru's life.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'And when Dharmaraja had said so, that maiden of<br>superior complexion, Pramadvara, endued with a moiety of Ruru's life,<br>rose as from her slumber. This bestowal by Ruru of a moiety of his own<br>span of life to resuscitate his bride afterwards led, as it would be<br>seen, to a curtailment of Ruru's life.<br><br>"And on an auspicious day their fathers gladly married them with due<br>rites. And the couple passed their days, devoted to each other. And Ruru<br>having obtained such a wife, as is hard to be found, beautiful and bright<br>as the filaments of the lotus, made a vow for the destruction of the<br>serpent-race. And whenever he saw a serpent he became filled with great<br>wrath and always killed it with a weapon.<br><br>"One day, O Brahmana, Ruru entered an extensive forest. And there he saw<br>an old serpent of the Dundubha species lying stretched on the ground. And<br>Ruru thereupon lifted up in anger his staff, even like to the staff of<br>Death, for the purpose of killing it. Then the Dundubha, addressing Ruru,<br>said, 'I have done thee no harm, O Brahmana! Then wherefore wilt thou<br>slay me in anger?'"<br><br>So ends the ninth section of the Pauloma Parva of the Adi Parva of the<br>blessed Mahabharata.
