                            "Vaisampayana said, 'That bull among the Bharatas, Arjuna, hearing these words <br>of the Gandharva, was inspired with feelings of devotion and stood shes, <br>killing deer and wild boars. Once on a time, while out in quest of deer, <br>the king became weak with exertion and thirst. The monarch arrived in that <br>state at the asylum of Vasishtha, and the blessed and illustrious Rishi <br>beholding him arrive, reverenced with his homage that best of men, king <br>Viswamitra. And O Bharata, the Rishi saluted the monarch by offering him <br>water to wash his face and feet with, and Arghya, and wild fruits, and <br>clarified butter. For the illustrious Rishi had a cow yielding anything <br>that was desired of her. When she was addressed, saying,  'O give', &#8212; <br>she always yielded the article that was sought. And she yielded various fruits<br>and corn, wild or grown in gardens and  fields, and milk, and many excellent <br>nutritive viands full of six different kinds of juice (taste?) and like unto nectar <br>itself, and various other kinds of enjoyable things, O Arjuna, of ambrosial <br>taste for drinking and eating, and for licking and sucking, and also <br>many precious gems and robes of various kinds. With these desirable objects <br>in profusion the monarch was worshipped. And the king with his minister and <br>troops became highly pleased. And the monarch wondered much, beholding that <br>cow with six elevated limbs and the beautiful flanks and hips, and five limbs<br>that were broad, and eyes prominent like those of the frog and beautiful in size, <br>and high udders, and faultless make, and straight and uplifted ears, and <br>handsome horns, and well-developed head and neck.<br><br>"And, O prince, the son of Gadhi, gratified with everything and applauding the <br>cow named Nandini, addressed the Rishi, saying, 'O Brahmana, O great Muni, <br>give me thy Naridini in exchange for ten thousand kine, or my kingdom. <br>Enjoy thou my kingdom (giving me thy cow).'<br><br>"Hearing these words of Viswamitra, Vasishtha said, 'O sinless one, this cow <br>hath been kept by me for the sake of the gods, guests, and the Pitris, as also <br>for my sacrifices. I cannot give Nandini in exchange for even thy kingdom.' <br>Viswamitra replied, 'I am a Kshatriya, but thou art a Brahmana devoted to asceticism <br>and study. Is there any energy in Brahmanas who are peaceful and who have their <br>souls under perfect command? When thou givest me not what I desire in exchange <br>even for ten thousand cows, I will not abandon the practice of my order; I will <br>take thy cow even by force!'<br><br>"Vasishtha said, 'Thou art a Kshatriya endued with might of arms. Thou art a powerful <br>monarch. O, do in haste what thou desirest; and stop not to consider its propriety.'<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'Thus addressed by Vasishtha, Viswamitra, O Partha, then <br>forcibly seized Nandini, that cow (white) like the swan or the moon, and attempted<br>to take her away, afflicting her with stripes and persecuting her otherwise. The <br>innocent Nandini then began, O Partha, to low piteously, and approaching the illustrious <br>Vasishtha stood before him with uplifted face. Though persecuted very cruelly, she <br>refused to leave the Rishi's asylum.'<br><br>"Beholding her in that plight, Vasishtha said, 'O amiable one, thou art lowing repeatedly <br>and I am hearing thy cries. But, O Nandini, even Viswamitra is taking thee away by force, <br>what can I do in this matter, as I am a forgiving Brahmana?'<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'Then, O bull in Bharata's race, Nandini, alarmed at the <br>sight of Viswamitra's troops and terrified by Viswamitra himself, approached the <br>Rishi still closer, and said, 'O illustrious one, why art thou so indifferent to<br>my poor self afflicted with the stripes of the cruel troops of Viswamitra and crying <br>so piteously as if I were masterless?' Hearing these words of the crying and <br>persecuted Nandini, the great Rishi lost not his patience nor turned from his vow <br>of forgiveness. He replied, 'The Kshatriya's might lies in physical strength, <br>the Brahmana's in forgiveness. Because I cannot give up forgiveness, go thou, <br>O Nandini, if thou choosest.' Nandini answered, 'Castest thou me away, O <br>illustrious one, that thou sayest so? If thou dost not cast me off, I cannot,<br>O Brahmana, be taken away by force.' Vasishtha said, 'O blessed one, I do not <br>cast thee off! Stay if thou canst! O, yonder is thy calf, tied with a stout <br>cord, and even now being weakened by it!'<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'Then the cow of Vasishtha, hearing the word stay, raised <br>her head and neck upward, and became terrible to behold. With eyes red with rage <br>and lowing repeatedly, she then attacked Viswamitra's troops on all sides. Afflicted <br>with their stripes and running hither and thither with those red eyes of hers, her <br>wrath increased. Blazing with rage, she soon became terrible to behold like unto <br>the sun in his midday glory. And from her tail she began to rain showers of burning <br>coals all around. And some moments after, from her tail she brought forth an army of <br>Palhavas, and from her udders, an army of Dravidas and Sakas; and from her womb, an <br>army of Yavanas, and from her dung, an army of Savaras; and from her urine, an army of <br>Kanchis; and from her sides, an army of Savaras. And from the froth of her mouth came <br>out hosts of Paundras and Kiratas, Yavanas and Sinhalas, and the barbarous tribes of <br>Khasas and Chivukas and Pulindas and Chinas and Hunas with Keralas, and numerous other <br>Mlechchhas. And that vast army of Mlechchhas in various uniforms, and armed with various <br>weapons, as soon as it sprang into life, deploying in the very sight of Viswamitra, <br>attacked that monarch's soldiers. And so numerous was that Mlechchha host that each <br>particular soldier of Viswamitra was attacked by a band of six or seven of their <br>enemies. Assailed with a mighty shower of weapons, Viswamitra's troops broke and <br>fled, panic-stricken, in all directions, before his very eyes. But, O bull in Bharata's <br>race, the troops of Vasishtha, though excited with wrath, took not the life of any of <br>Viswamitra's troops. Nandini simply caused the monarch's army to be routed and driven off.<br>And driven (from the asylum) twenty-seven full miles, panic-stricken, they shrieked aloud <br>and beheld not anyone that could protect them. Viswamitra, beholding this wonderful feat <br>that resulted from Brahmana prowess, became disgusted with Kshatriya prowess and said, <br>'O, fie on Kshatriya prowess! Brahmana prowess is true prowess! In judging of strength <br>and weakness, I see that asceticism is true strength.' Saying this, the monarch, <br>abandoning his large domains and regal splendour and turning his back upon all pleasures, <br>set his mind on asceticism. Crowned with success in asceticism and filling the three <br>worlds with the heat of his ascetic penances, he afflicted all creatures and finally <br>became a Brahmana. The son of Kusika at last drank Soma with Indra himself (in Heaven).'"
