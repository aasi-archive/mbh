                            (Vaivahika Parva)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed Dhrishtadyumna, that foremost of the<br>Lunar princes, cheerfully said unto his father all that had happened and<br>by whom Krishna had been won. And the prince said, 'With large, red eyes,<br>attired in deer-skin, and resembling a celestial in beauty, the youth who<br>strung that foremost of bows and brought down to the ground the mark set<br>on high, was soon surrounded by the foremost of Brahmanas who also<br>offered him their homage for the feat he had achieved. Incapable of<br>bearing the sight of a foe and endued with great activity, he began to<br>exert his prowess. And surrounded by the Brahmanas he resembled the<br>thunder-wielding Indra standing in the midst of the celestials, and the<br>Rishis. And like a she-elephant following the leader of a herd, Krishna<br>cheerfully followed that youth catching hold of his deer-skin. Then when<br>the assembled monarchs incapable of bearing that sight lose up in wrath<br>and advanced for fight, there rose up another hero who tearing up a large<br>tree rushed at that concourse of kings, felling them right and left like<br>Yama himself smiting down creatures endued with life. Then, O monarch,<br>the assembled kings stood motionless and looked at that couple of heroes,<br>while they, resembling the Sun and the Moon, taking Krishna with them,<br>left the amphitheatre and went into the abode of a potter in the suburbs<br>of the town, and there at the potter's abode sat a lady like unto a flame<br>of fire who, I think, is their mother. And around her also sat three<br>other foremost of men each of whom was like unto fire. And the couple of<br>heroes having approached her paid homage unto her feet, and they said<br>unto Krishna also to do the same. And keeping Krishna with her, those<br>foremost of men all went the round of eleemosynary visits. Some time<br>after when they returned, Krishna taking from them what they had obtained<br>as alms, devoted a portion thereof to the gods, and gave another portion<br>away (in gift) to Brahmanas. And of what remained after this, she gave a<br>portion to that venerable lady, and distributed the rest amongst those<br>five foremost of men. And she took a little for herself and ate it last<br>of all. Then, O monarch, they all laid themselves down for sleep, Krishna<br>lying along the line of their feet as their nether pillow. And the bed on<br>which they lay was made of kusa grass upon which was spread their<br>deer-skins. And before going to sleep they talked on diverse subjects in<br>voices deep as of black clouds. The talk of those heroes indicated them<br>to be neither Vaisyas nor Sudras, nor Brahmanas. Without doubt, O<br>monarch, they are bulls amongst Kshatriyas, their discourse having been<br>on military subjects. It seems, O father, that our hope hath been<br>fructified, for we have heard that the sons of Kunti all escaped from the<br>conflagration of the house of lac. From the way in which the mark was<br>shot down by that youth, and the strength with which the bow was strung<br>by him, and the manner in which I have heard them talk with one another<br>proves conclusively, O monarch, that they are the sons of Pritha<br>wandering in disguise.'<br><br>"Hearing these words of his son, king Drupada became exceedingly glad,<br>and he sent unto them his priest directing him to ascertain who they were<br>and whether they were the sons of the illustrious Pandu. Thus directed,<br>the king's priest went unto them and applauding them all, delivered the<br>king's message duly, saying, 'Ye who are worthy of preference in<br>everything, the boon-giving king of the earth&#8212;Drupada&#8212;is desirous of<br>ascertaining who ye are. Beholding this one who hath shot down the mark,<br>his joy knoweth no bounds. Giving us all particulars of your family and<br>tribe, place ye your feet on the heads of your foes and gladden the<br>hearts of the king of Panchala mid his men and mine also. King Pandu was<br>the dear friend of Drupada and was regarded by him as his counterself.<br>And Drupada had all along cherished the desire of bestowing this daughter<br>of his upon Pandu as his daughter-in-law. Ye heroes of features perfectly<br>faultless, king Drupada hath all along cherished this desire in his heart<br>that Arjuna of strong and long arms might wed this daughter of his<br>according to the ordinance. If that hath become possible, nothing could<br>be better; nothing more beneficial; nothing more conducive to fame and<br>virtue, so far as Drupada is concerned.'<br><br>"Having said this, the priest remained silent and humbly waited for an<br>answer. Beholding him sitting thus, the king Yudhishthira commanded Bhima<br>who sat near, saying, 'Let water to wash his feet with and the Arghya be<br>offered unto this Brahmana. He is king Drupada's priest and, therefore,<br>worthy of great respect. We should worship him with more than ordinary<br>reverence.' Then, O monarch, Bhima did as directed. Accepting the worship<br>thus offered unto him, the Brahmana with a joyous heart sat at his ease.<br>Then Yudhishthira addressed him and said, 'The king of the Panchalas<br>hath, by fixing a special kind of dower, given away his daughter<br>according to the practice of his order and not freely. This hero hath, by<br>satisfying that demand, won the princess. King Drupada, therefore, hath<br>nothing now to say in regard to the race, tribe, family and disposition<br>of him who hath performed that feat. Indeed, all his queries have been<br>answered by the stringing of the bow and the shooting down of the mark.<br>It is by doing what he had directed that this illustrious hero hath<br>brought away Krishna from among the assembled monarchs. In these<br>circumstances, the king of the Lunar race should not indulge in any<br>regrets which can only make him unhappy without mending matters in the<br>least. The desire that king Drupada hath all along cherished will be<br>accomplished for his handsome princess who beareth, I think, every<br>auspicious mark. None that is weak in strength could string that bow, and<br>none of mean birth and unaccomplished in arms could have shot down the<br>mark. It behoveth not, therefore, the king of the Panchalas to grieve for<br>his daughter today. Nor can anybody in the world undo that act of<br>shooting down the mark. Therefore the king should not grieve for what<br>must take its course.'<br><br>"While Yudhishthira was saying all this, another messenger from the king<br>of the Panchalas, coming thither in haste, said, 'The (nuptial), feast is<br>ready.'"
