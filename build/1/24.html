                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Then hearing of and beholding his own body, that bird of<br>beautiful feathers diminished its size.'<br><br>"And Garuda said, 'Let no creature be afraid; as ye are in a fright at<br>the sight of my terrible form, I shall diminish my energy.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Then that bird capable of going everywhere at will,<br>that ranger of the skies capable of calling to his aid any measure of<br>energy, bearing Aruna on his back, wended from his father's home and<br>arrived at his mother's side on the other shore of the great ocean. And<br>he placed Aruna of great splendour in the eastern regions, just at a time<br>when Surya had resolved to burn the worlds with his fierce rays.'<br><br>"Saunaka said, 'When did the revered Surya resolve at the time to burn<br>the worlds? What wrong was done to him by the gods that provoked his<br>ire?'<br><br>"Sauti said, 'O sinless one, when Rahu was drinking nectar among the gods<br>at the time of the churning of the ocean he was pointed out to the gods<br>by Surya and Soma, and from that time he conceived an enmity towards<br>those deities. And upon this Rahu sought to devour his afflictor (Surya),<br>became wroth, and thought, 'Oh, this enmity of Rahu towards me hath<br>sprung from my desire of benefiting the gods. And this dire consequence I<br>alone have to sustain. Indeed, at this pass help I obtain not. And before<br>the very eyes of the denizens of heaven I am going to be devoured and<br>they brook it quietly. Therefore, for the destruction of the worlds must<br>I strive.' And with this resolution he went to the mountains of the west.<br><br>"And from that place he began to radiate his heat around for the<br>destruction of the world. And then the great Rishis, approaching the<br>gods, spake unto them, 'Lo, in the middle of the night springeth a great<br>heat striking terror into every heart, and destructive of the three<br>worlds.' Then the gods, accompanied by the Rishis, wended to the<br>Grandsire, and said unto him, 'O what is this great heat today that<br>causeth such panic? Surya hath not yet risen, still the destruction (of<br>the world) is obvious. O Lord, what will happen when he doth rise?" The<br>Grandsire replied, 'Indeed, Surya is prepared to rise today for the<br>destruction of the world. As soon as he will appear he will burn<br>everything into a heap of ashes. By me, however, hath the remedy been<br>provided beforehand. The intelligent son of Kasyapa is known to all by<br>the name of Aruna. He is huge of body and of great splendour; he shall<br>stay in front of Surya, doing the duty of his charioteer and taking away<br>all the energy of the former. And this will ensure the welfare of the<br>worlds, of the Rishis, and of the dwellers in heaven.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Aruna, at the behest of the Grandsire, did all that he<br>was ordered to do. And Surya rose veiled by Aruna's person. I have told<br>thee now why Surya was in wrath, and how Aruna, the brother of Garuda,<br>was appointed as his charioteer. Hear next of that other question asked<br>by thee a little while ago.'"<br><br>And so ends the twenty-fourth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi<br>Parva.
