                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'O foremost of Brahmanas, the gods having prepared for<br>battle in that way, Garuda, the king of birds, soon came upon those wise<br>ones. And the gods beholding him of excessive strength began to quake<br>with fear, and strike one another with all their weapons. And amongst<br>those that guarded the Soma was Brahmana (the celestial architect), of<br>measureless might, effulgent as the electric fire and of great energy.<br>And after a terrific encounter lasting only a moment, managed by the lord<br>of birds with his talons, beak, and wings, he lay as dead on the fields.<br>And the ranger of the skies making the worlds dark with the dust raised<br>by the hurricane of his wings, overwhelmed the celestials with it. And<br>the latter, overwhelmed with that dust, swooned away. And the immortals<br>who guarded the amrita, blinded by that dust, could no longer see Garuda.<br>Even thus did Garuda agitate the region of the heavens. And even thus he<br>mangled the gods with the wounds inflicted by his wings and beak.<br><br>"Then the god of a thousand eyes commanded Vayu (the god of wind),<br>saying, 'Dispel thou this shower of dust soon. O Maruta, this is indeed,<br>thy task. Then the mighty Vayu soon drove away that dust. And when the<br>darkness had disappeared, the celestials attacked Garuda. And as he of<br>great might was attacked by the gods, he began to roar aloud, like the<br>great cloud that appeareth in the sky at the end of the Yuga, frightening<br>every creature. And that king of birds, of great energy, that slayer of<br>hostile heroes, then rose on his wings. All the wise ones (the<br>celestials) with Indra amongst them armed with double-edged broad swords,<br>iron maces furnished with sharp spikes, pointed lances, maces, bright<br>arrows, and many a discus of the form of the sun, saw him over head. And<br>the king of birds, attacked them on all sides with showers of various<br>weapons and fought exceedingly hard without wavering for a moment. And<br>the son of Vinata, of great prowess blazing in the sky, attacked the gods<br>on all sides with his wings and breast. And blood began to flow copiously<br>from the bodies of the gods mangled by the talons and the beak of Garuda.<br>Overcome by the lord of birds, the Sadhyas with the Gandharvas fled<br>eastwards, the Vasus with the Rudras towards the south, the Adityas<br>towards the west, and the twin Aswins towards the north. Gifted with<br>great energy, they retreated fighting, looking back every moment on their<br>enemy.<br><br>"And Garuda had encounters with the Yakshas, Aswakranda of great courage,<br>Rainuka, the bold Krathanaka, Tapana, Uluka, Swasanaka, Nimesha, Praruja,<br>and Pulina. And the son of Vinata mangled them with his wings, talons,<br>and beak, like Siva himself, that chastiser of enemies, and the holder of<br>Pinaka in rage at the end of the Yuga. And those Yakshas of great might<br>and courage, mangled all over by that ranger of the skies, looked like<br>masses of black clouds dropping thick showers of blood.<br><br>"And Garuda, depriving them of life, and then went to where the amrita<br>was. And he saw that it was surrounded on all sides by fire. And the<br>terrible flames of that fire covered the entire sky. And moved by violent<br>winds, they seemed bent on burning the Sun himself. The illustrious<br>Garuda then assumed ninety times ninety mouths and quickly drinking the<br>waters of many rivers with those mouths and returning with great speed,<br>that chastiser of enemies, having wings for his vehicle extinguished that<br>fire with that water. And extinguishing that fire, he assumed a very<br>small form, desirous of entering into (the place where the Soma was).'"<br><br>So ends the thirty-second section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.
