                            (Pauloma Parva continued)<br><br>"Saunaka said, 'Child, thy father formerly read the whole of the Puranas,<br>O son of Lomaharshana, and the Bharata with Krishna-Dwaipayana. Hast thou<br>also made them thy study? In those ancient records are chronicled<br>interesting stories and the history of the first generations of the wise<br>men, all of which we heard being rehearsed by thy sire. In the first<br>place, I am desirous of hearing the history of the race of Bhrigu.<br>Recount thou that history, we shall attentively listen to thee."<br><br>"Sauti answered, 'By me hath been acquired all that was formerly studied<br>by the high-souled Brahmanas including Vaisampayana and repeated by them;<br>by me hath been acquired all that had been studied by my father. O<br>descendant of the Bhrigu race, attend then to so much as relateth to the<br>exalted race of Bhrigu, revered by Indra and all the gods, by the tribes<br>of Rishis and Maruts (Winds). O great Muni, I shall first properly<br>recount the story of this family, as told in the Puranas.<br><br>"The great and blessed saint Bhrigu, we are informed, was produced by the<br>self-existing Brahma from the fire at the sacrifice of Varuna. And Bhrigu<br>had a son, named Chyavana, whom he dearly loved. And to Chyavana was born<br>a virtuous son called Pramati. And Pramati had a son named Ruru by<br>Ghritachi (the celestial dancer). And to Ruru also by his wife<br>Pramadvara, was born a son, whose name was Sunaka. He was, O Saunaka, thy<br>great ancestor exceedingly virtuous in his ways. He was devoted to<br>asceticism, of great reputation, proficient in law, and eminent among<br>those having a knowledge of the Vedas. He was virtuous, truthful, and of<br>well-regulated fare.'<br><br>"Saunaka said, 'O son of Suta, I ask thee why the illustrious son of<br>Bhrigu was named Chyavana. Do tell me all.'<br><br>"Sauti replied, 'Bhrigu had a wife named Puloma whom he dearly loved. She<br>became big with child by Bhrigu. And one day while the virtuous continent<br>Puloma was in that condition, Bhrigu, great among those that are true to<br>their religion, leaving her at home went out to perform his ablutions. It<br>was then that the Rakshasa called Puloma came to Bhrigu's abode. And<br>entering the Rishi's abode, the Rakshasa saw the wife of Bhrigu,<br>irreproachable in everything. And seeing her he became filled with lust<br>and lost his senses. The beautiful Puloma entertained the Rakshasa thus<br>arrived, with roots and fruits of the forest. And the Rakshasa who burnt<br>with desire upon seeing her, became very much delighted and resolved, O<br>good sage, to carry her away who was so blameless in every respect.<br><br>'My design is accomplished,' said the Rakshasa, and so seizing that<br>beautiful matron he carried her away. And, indeed, she of agreeable<br>smiles, had been betrothed by her father himself, to him, although the<br>former subsequently bestowed her, according to due rites, on Bhrigu. O<br>thou of the Bhrigu race, this wound rankled deep in the Rakshasa's mind<br>and he thought the present moment very opportune for carrying the lady<br>away.<br><br>"And the Rakshasa saw the apartment in which the sacrificial fire was<br>kept burning brightly. The Rakshasa then asked the flaming element 'Tell<br>me, O Agni, whose wife this woman rightfully is. Thou art the mouth of<br>gods; therefore thou art bound to answer my question. This lady of<br>superior complexion had been first accepted by me as wife, but her father<br>subsequently bestowed her on the false Bhrigu. Tell me truly if this fair<br>one can be regarded as the wife of Bhrigu, for having found her alone, I<br>have resolved to take her away by force from the hermitage. My heart<br>burneth with rage when I reflect that Bhrigu hath got possession of this<br>woman of slender waist, first betrothed to me.'"<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'In this manner the Rakshasa asked the flaming god of<br>fire again and again whether the lady was Bhrigu's wife. And the god was<br>afraid to return an answer. 'Thou, O god of fire,' said he, residest<br>constantly within every creature, as witness of her or his merits and<br>demerits. O thou respected one, then answer my question truly. Has not<br>Bhrigu appropriated her who was chosen by me as my wife? Thou shouldst<br>declare truly whether, therefore, she is my wife by first choice. After<br>thy answer as to whether she is the wife of Bhrigu, I will bear her away<br>from this hermitage even in sight of thee. Therefore answer thou truly.'"<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'The Seven flamed god having heard these words of the<br>Rakshasa became exceedingly distressed, being afraid of telling a<br>falsehood and equally afraid of Bhrigu's curse. And the god at length<br>made answer in words that came out slowly. 'This Puloma was, indeed,<br>first chosen by thee, O Rakshasa, but she was not taken by thee with holy<br>rites and invocations. But this far-famed lady was bestowed by her father<br>on Bhrigu as a gift from desire of blessing. She was not bestowed on thee<br>O Rakshasa, this lady was duly made by the Rishi Bhrigu his wife with<br>Vedic rites in my presence. This is she&#8212;I know her. I dare not speak a<br>falsehood. O thou best of the Rakshasas, falsehood is never respected in<br>this world.'"
