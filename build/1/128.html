                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then Bhishma and Kunti with their friends celebrated<br>the Sraddha of the deceased monarch, and offered the Pinda. And they<br>feasted the Kauravas and thousands of Brahmanas unto whom they also gave<br>gems and lands. Then the citizens returned to Hastinapura with the sons<br>of Pandu, now that they had been cleansed from the impurity incident to<br>the demise of their father. All then fell to weeping for the departed<br>king. It seemed as if they had lost one of their own kin.<br><br>"When the Sraddha had been celebrated in the manner mentioned above, the<br>venerable Vyasa, seeing all the subjects sunk in grief, said one day to<br>his mother Satyavati, 'Mother, our days of happiness have gone by and<br>days of calamity have succeeded. Sin beginneth to increase day by day.<br>The world hath got old. The empire of the Kauravas will no longer endure<br>because of wrong and oppression. Go thou then into the forest, and devote<br>thyself to contemplation through Yoga. Henceforth society will be filled<br>with deceit and wrong. Good work will cease. Do not witness the<br>annihilation of thy race, in thy old age.'<br><br>"Acquiescing in the words of Vyasa, Satyavati entered the inner<br>apartments and addressed her daughter-in-law, saying, 'O Ambika, I hear<br>that in consequence of the deeds of your grandsons, this Bharata dynasty<br>and its subjects will perish. If thou permit, I would go to the forest<br>with Kausalya, so grieved at the loss of her son.' O king, saying this<br>the queen, taking the permission of Bhishma also, went to the forest. And<br>arriving there with her two daughters-in-law, she became engaged in<br>profound contemplation, and in good time leaving her body ascended to<br>heaven.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then the sons of king Pandu, having gone<br>through all the purifying rites prescribed in the Vedas, began to grow up<br>in princely style in the home of their father. Whenever they were engaged<br>in play with the sons of Dhritarashtra, their superiority of strength<br>became marked. In speed, in striking the objects aimed at, in consuming<br>articles of food, and scattering dust, Bhimasena beat all the sons of<br>Dhritarashtra. The son of the Wind-god pulled them by the hair and made<br>them fight with one another, laughing all the while. And Vrikodara easily<br>defeated those hundred and one children of great energy as if they were<br>one instead of being a hundred and one. The second Pandava used to seize<br>them by the hair, and throwing them down, to drag them along the earth.<br>By this, some had their knees broken, some their heads, and some their<br>shoulders. That youth, sometimes holding ten of them, drowned them in<br>water, till they were nearly dead. When the sons of Dhritarashtra got up<br>to the boughs of a tree for plucking fruits, Bhima used to shake that<br>tree, by striking it with his foot, so that down came the fruits and the<br>fruitpluckers at the same time. In fact, those princes were no match for<br>Bhima in pugilistic encounters, in speed, or in skill. Bhima used to make<br>a display of his strength by thus tormenting them in childishness but not<br>from malice.<br><br>"Seeing these wonderful exhibitions of the might of Bhima, the powerful<br>Duryodhana, the eldest son of Dhritarashtra, began to conceive hostility<br>towards him. And the wicked and unrighteous Duryodhana, through ignorance<br>and ambition, prepared himself for an act of sin. He thought, 'There is<br>no other individual who can compare with Bhima, the second son of Pandu,<br>in point of prowess. I shall have to destroy him by artifice. Singly,<br>Bhima dares a century of us to the combat. Therefore, when he shall sleep<br>in the garden, I shall throw him into the current of the Ganga.<br>Afterwards, confining his eldest brother Yudhishthira and his younger<br>brother Arjuna, I shall reign sole king without molestation.' Determined<br>thus, the wicked Duryodhana was ever on the watch to find out an<br>opportunity for injuring Bhima. And, O Bharata, at length at a beautiful<br>place called Pramanakoti on the banks of the Ganga, he built a palace<br>decorated with hangings of broad-cloth and other rich stuffs. And he<br>built this palace for sporting in the water there, and filled it with all<br>kinds of entertaining things and choice viands. Gay flags waved on the<br>top of this mansion. The name of the house was 'the water-sport house.'<br>Skilful cooks prepared various kinds of viands. When all was ready, the<br>officers gave intimation to Duryodhana. Then the evil-minded prince said<br>unto the Pandavas, 'Let us all go to the banks of the Ganga graced with<br>trees and crowned with flowers and sport there in the water.' And upon<br>Yudhishthira agreeing to this, the sons of Dhritarashtra, taking the<br>Pandavas with them, mounted country-born elephants of great size and cars<br>resembling towns, and left the metropolis.<br><br>"On arriving at the place, the princes dismissed their attendants, and<br>surveying the beauty of the gardens and the groves, entered the palace,<br>like lions entering their mountain caves. On entering they saw that the<br>architects had handsomely plastered the walls and the ceilings and that<br>painters had painted them beautifully. The windows looked very graceful,<br>and the artificial fountains were splendid. Here and there were tanks of<br>pellucid water in which bloomed forests of lotuses. The banks were decked<br>with various flowers whose fragrance filled the atmosphere. The Kauravas<br>and the Pandavas sat down and began to enjoy the things provided for<br>them. They became engaged in play and began to exchange morsels of food<br>with one another. Meanwhile the wicked Duryodhana had mixed a powerful<br>poison with a quantity of food, with the object of making away with<br>Bhima. That wicked youth who had nectar in his tongue and a razor in his<br>heart, rose at length, and in a friendly way fed Bhima largely with that<br>poisoned food, and thinking himself lucky in having compassed his end,<br>was exceedingly glad at heart. Then the sons of Dhritarashtra and Pandu<br>together became cheerfully engaged in sporting in the water. Their sport<br>having been finished, they dressed themselves in white habiliments, and<br>decked themselves with various ornaments. Fatigued with play, they felt<br>inclined in the evening to rest in the pleasurehouse belonging to the<br>garden. Having made the other youths take exercise in the waters, the<br>powerful second Pandava was excessively fatigued. So that on rising from<br>the water, he lay down on the ground. He was weary and under the<br>influence of the poison. And the cool air served to spread the poison<br>over all his frame, so that he lost his senses at once. Seeing this<br>Duryodhana bound him with chords of shrubs, and threw him into the water.<br>The insensible son of Pandu sank down till he reached the Naga kingdom.<br>Nagas, furnished with fangs containing virulent venom, bit him by<br>thousands. The vegetable poison, mingled in the blood of the son of the<br>Wind god, was neutralised by the snake-poison. The serpents had bitten<br>all over his frame, except his chest, the skin of which was so tough that<br>their fangs could not penetrate it.<br><br>"On regaining consciousness, the son of Kunti burst his bands and began<br>to press the snakes down under the ground. A remnant fled for life, and<br>going to their king Vasuki, represented, 'O king of snakes, a man drowned<br>under the water, bound in chords of shrubs; probably he had drunk poison.<br>For when he fell amongst us, he was insensible. But when we began to bite<br>him, he regained his senses, and bursting his fetters, commenced laying<br>at us. May it please Your Majesty to enquire who is.'<br><br>"Then Vasuki, in accordance with the prayer of the inferior Nagas, went<br>to the place and saw Bhimasena. Of the serpents, there was one, named<br>Aryaka. He was the grandfather of the father of Kunti. The lord of<br>serpents saw his relative and embraced him. Then, Vasuki, learning all,<br>was pleased with Bhima, and said to Aryaka with satisfaction, 'How are we<br>to please him? Let him have money and gems in profusion."<br><br>"On hearing the words of Vasuki, Aryaka said, 'O king of serpents, when<br>Your Majesty is pleased with him, no need of wealth for him! Permit him<br>to drink of rasakunda (nectar-vessels) and thus acquire immeasurable<br>strength. There is the strength of a thousand elephants in each one of<br>those vessels. Let this prince drink as much as he can.'<br><br>"The king of serpents gave his consent. And the serpents thereupon began<br>auspicious rites. Then purifying himself carefully, Bhimasena facing the<br>east began to drink nectar. At one breath, he quaffed off the contents of<br>a whole vessel, and in this manner drained off eight successive jars,<br>till he was full. At length, the serpents prepared an excellent bed for<br>him, on which he lay down at ease.'"
