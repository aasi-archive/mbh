                            (Khandava-daha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'When the fire blazed forth in the forest of<br>Khandava, the infant birds became very much distressed and afflicted.<br>Filled with anxiety, they saw not any means of escape. Their mother, the<br>helpless Jarita, knowing that they were too young to escape, was filled<br>with sorrow and wept aloud. And she said, 'Oh, the terrible<br>conflagration, illuminating the whole universe and burning the forest<br>down, approacheth towards us, increasing my woe. These infants with<br>immature understanding, without feathers and feet, and the sole refuge of<br>our deceased ancestors, afflict me. Oh, this fire approacheth, spreading<br>fear all around, and licking with its tongue the tallest trees. But my<br>unfledged children are incapable of effecting their escape. I myself am<br>not capable of escaping, taking all these with me. Nor am I capable of<br>abandoning them, for my heart is distressed on their account. Whom<br>amongst my sons, shall I leave behind, and whom shall I carry with me?<br>What (act) should I do now that is consistent with duty? What also do<br>you, my infant sons, think? I do not, even by reflection, see any way of<br>escape for you. I shall even cover you with my wings and die with you.<br>Your cruel father left me some time before, saying, 'Upon this Jaritari,<br>because he is the eldest of my sons, will my race depend. My second<br>Sarisrikka will beget progeny for the expansion of my ancestors' race. My<br>third, Stamvamitra, will be devoted to asceticism, and my youngest,<br>Drona, will become the foremost of those acquainted with the Vedas.' But<br>how hath this terrible calamity overtaken us! Whom shall I take with me?<br>As I am deprived of judgment what should I do that is consistent with<br>duty? I do not see, by the exercise of my own judgment, the escape of my<br>children from the fire!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Unto their mother indulging in these lamentations,<br>the infant ones said. 'O mother, relinquishing thy affection for us, go<br>thou to a place where there is no fire. If we are killed here, thou<br>mayest have other children born to thee. If thou, O mother be killed, we<br>can have no more children in our race. Reflecting upon both these<br>calamities, the time hath come for thee, O mother, to do that which is<br>beneficial to our race. Do not be influenced by affection for thy<br>offspring, which promises to destroy both us and thee. If thou savest<br>thyself, our father, who is even desirous of winning regions of felicity,<br>may have his wishes gratified.'<br><br>"Hearing what the infants said. Jarita replied, 'There is a hole here in<br>the ground near to this tree, belonging to a mouse. Enter this hole<br>without loss of time. You shall have then no fear of fire. After ye have<br>entered it, I shall, ye children, cover its mouth with dust. This is the<br>only means of escape that I see from the blazing fire. Then when the fire<br>will be put out, I shall return hither to remove the dust. Follow my<br>advice if you are to escape from the conflagration.'<br><br>"The infant birds replied, 'Without feathers we are but so many balls of<br>flesh. If we enter the hole, certain it is that the carnivorous mouse<br>will destroy us all. Beholding this danger before us, we cannot enter<br>this hole. Alas, we do not see any means by which we may escape from the<br>fire or from the mouse. We do not see how our father's act of procreation<br>may be prevented from becoming futile, and how also our mother may be<br>saved. If we enter the hole, the mouse will destroy us; we remain where<br>we are and the sky-ranging fire will destroy us. Reflecting upon both the<br>calamities, a death by fire is preferable to a death by being eaten up.<br>If we are devoured by the mouse within the hole, that death is certainly<br>ignoble, whereas the destruction of the body in fire is approved by the<br>wise.'"
