                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'O thou of Kuru's race, after Chitrangada was slain,<br>his successor Vichitravirya being a minor, Bhishma ruled the kingdom,<br>placing himself under the command of Satyavati. When he saw that his<br>brother, who was the foremost of intelligent men, attained to majority,<br>Bhishma set his heart upon marrying Vichitravirya. At this time he heard<br>that the three daughters of the king of Kasi, all equal in beauty to the<br>Apsaras themselves, would be married on the same occasion, selecting<br>their husbands at a self-choice ceremony. Then that foremost of<br>car-warriors, that vanquisher of all foes, at the command of his mother,<br>went to the city of Varanasi in a single chariot. There Bhishma, the son<br>of Santanu, saw that innumerable monarchs had come from all directions;<br>and there he also saw those three maidens that would select their own<br>husbands. And when the (assembled) kings were each being mentioned by<br>name, Bhishma chose those maidens (on behalf of his brother). And taking<br>them upon his chariot, Bhishma, that first of smiters in battle,<br>addressed the kings, O monarch, and said in a voice deep as the roar of<br>the clouds, 'The wise have directed that when an accomplished person has<br>been invited, a maiden may be bestowed on him, decked with ornaments and<br>along with many valuable presents. Others again may bestow their<br>daughters by accepting a couple of kine. Some again bestow their<br>daughters by taking a fixed sum, and some take away maidens by force.<br>Some wed with the consent of the maidens, some by drugging them into<br>consent, and some by going unto the maidens' parents and obtaining their<br>sanction. Some again obtain wives as presents for assisting at<br>sacrifices. Of these, the learned always applaud the eighth form of<br>marriage. Kings, however, speak highly of the Swyamvara (the fifth form<br>as above) and themselves wed according to it. But the sages have said<br>that, that wife is dearly to be prized who is taken away by force, after<br>the slaughter of opponents, from amidst the concourse of princes and<br>kings invited to a self-choice ceremony. Therefore, ye monarchs, I bear<br>away these maidens hence by force. Strive ye, to the best of your might,<br>to vanquish me or to be vanquished. Ye monarchs, I stand here resolved to<br>fight!' Kuru prince, endued with great energy, thus addressing the<br>assembled monarchs and the king of Kasi, took upon his car those maidens.<br>And having taken them up, he sped his chariot away, challenging the<br>invited kings to a fight.<br><br>"The challenged monarchs then all stood up, slapping their arms and<br>biting their nether lips in wrath. And loud was the din produced, as, in<br>a great hurry, they began to cast off their ornaments and put on their<br>armour. And the motion of their ornaments and armour, O Janamejaya,<br>brilliant as these were, resembled meteoric flashes in the sky. And with<br>brows contracted and eyes red with rage, the monarchs moved in<br>impatience, their armour and ornaments dazzling or waving with their<br>agitated steps. The charioteers soon brought handsome cars with fine<br>horses harnessed thereto. Those splendid warriors then, equipped with all<br>kinds of weapons, rode on those cars, and with uplifted weapons pursued<br>the retreating chief of the Kurus. Then, O Bharata, occurred the terrible<br>encounter between those innumerable monarchs on one side and the Kuru<br>warrior alone on the other. And the assembled monarchs threw at their foe<br>ten thousand arrows at the same time. Bhishma, however speedily checked<br>those numberless arrows before they could come at him by means of a<br>shower of his own arrows as innumerable as the down on the body. Then<br>those kings surrounded him from all sides and rained arrows on him like<br>masses of clouds showering on the mountain-breast. But Bhishma, arresting<br>with his shafts the course of that arrowy downpour, pierced each of the<br>monarchs with three shafts. The latter, in their turn pierced Bhishma,<br>each with five shafts. But, O king, Bhishma checked those by his prowess<br>and pierced each of the contending kings with two shafts. The combat<br>became so fierce with that dense shower of arrows and other missiles that<br>it looked very much like the encounter between the celestials and the<br>Asuras of old, and men of courage who took no part in it were struck with<br>fear even to look at the scene. Bhishma cut off, with his arrows, on the<br>field of battle, bows, and flagstaffs, and coats of mail, and human heads<br>by hundreds and thousands. And such was his terrible prowess and<br>extraordinary lightness of hand, and such the skill with which he<br>protected himself, that the contending car-warriors, though his enemies,<br>began to applaud him loudly. Then that foremost of all wielders of<br>weapons having vanquished in battle all those monarchs, pursued his way<br>towards the capital of the Bharatas, taking those maidens with him.<br><br>"It was then, O king, that mighty car-warrior, king Salya of immeasurable<br>prowess, from behind summoned Bhishma, the son of Santanu, to an<br>encounter. And desirous of obtaining the maidens, he came upon Bhishma<br>like a mighty leader of a herd of elephants rushing upon another of his<br>kind, and tearing with his tusks the latter's hips at the sight of a<br>female elephant in heat. And Salya of mighty arms, moved by wrath<br>addressed Bhishma and said, 'Stay, Stay.' Then Bhishma, that tiger among<br>men, that grinder of hostile armies, provoked by these words, flamed up<br>in wrath like a blazing fire. Bow in hand, and brow furrowed into<br>wrinkles, he stayed on his car, in obedience to Kshatriya usage having<br>checked its course in expectation of the enemy. All the monarchs seeing<br>him stop, stood there to become spectators of the coming encounter<br>between him and Salya. The two then began to exhibit their prowess (upon<br>each other) like roaring bulls of great strength at the sight of a cow in<br>rut. Then that foremost of men, king Salya covered Bhishma, the son of<br>Santanu with hundreds and thousands of swift-winged shafts. And those<br>monarchs seeing Salya thus covering Bhishma at the outset with<br>innumerable shafts, wondered much and uttered shouts of applause.<br>Beholding his lightness of hand in combat, the crowd of regal spectators<br>became very glad and applauded Salya greatly. That subjugator of hostile<br>towns, Bhishma, then, on hearing those shouts of the Kshatriyas, became<br>very angry and said, 'Stay, Stay'. In wrath, he commanded his charioteer,<br>saying, 'Lead thou my car to where Salya is, so that I may slay him<br>instantly as Garuda slays a serpent.' Then the Kuru chief fixed the<br>Varuna weapon on his bow-string, and with it afflicted the four steeds of<br>king Salya. And, O tiger among kings, the Kuru chief, then, warding off<br>with his weapons those of his foe, slew Salya's charioteer. Then that<br>first of men, Bhishma, the son of Santanu, fighting for the sake of those<br>damsels, slew with the Aindra weapon the noble steeds of his adversary.<br>He then vanquished that best of monarchs but left him with his life. O<br>bull of Bharata's race, Salya, after his defeat, returned to his kingdom<br>and continued to rule it virtuously. And O conqueror of hostile towns,<br>the other kings also, who had come to witness, the self-choice ceremony<br>returned to their own kingdoms.<br><br>"That foremost of smiters, viz., Bhishma, after defeating those monarchs,<br>set out with those damsels, for Hastinapura whence the virtuous Kuru<br>prince Vichitravirya ruled the earth like that best of monarchs, viz.,<br>his father Santanu. And, O king, passing through many forests, rivers,<br>hills, and woods abounding with trees, he arrived (at the capital) in no<br>time. Of immeasurable prowess in battle, the son of the ocean-going<br>Ganga, having slain numberless foes in battle without a scratch on his<br>own person, brought the daughters of the king of Kasi unto the Kurus as<br>tenderly if they were his daughters-in-law, or younger sisters, or<br>daughters. And Bhishma of mighty arms, impelled by the desire of<br>benefiting his brother, having by his prowess brought them thus, then<br>offered those maidens possessing every accomplishment unto Vichitravirya.<br>Conversant with the dictates of virtue, the son of Santanu, having<br>achieved such an extraordinary feat according to (kingly) custom, then<br>began to make preparations for his brother's wedding. And when everything<br>about the wedding had been settled by Bhishma in consultation with<br>Satyavati, the eldest daughter of the king of Kasi, with a soft smile,<br>told him these words, 'At heart I had chosen the king of Saubha for my<br>husband. He had, in his heart, accepted me for his wife. This was also<br>approved by my father. At the self-choice ceremony also I would have<br>chosen him as my lord. Thou art conversant with all the dictates of<br>virtue, knowing all this, do as thou likest.' Thus addressed by that<br>maiden in the presence of the Brahmanas, the heroic Bhishma began to<br>reflect as to what should be done. As he was conversant with the rules of<br>virtue, he consulted with the Brahmanas who had mastered the Vedas, and<br>permitted Amba, the eldest daughter of the ruler of Kasi to do as she<br>liked. But he bestowed with due rites the two other daughters, Ambika and<br>Ambalika on his younger brother Vichitravirya. And though Vichitravirya<br>was virtuous and abstemious, yet, proud of youth and beauty, he soon<br>became lustful after his marriage. And both Ambika and Ambalika were of<br>tall stature, and of the complexion of molten gold. And their heads were<br>covered with black curly hair, and their finger-nails were high and red;<br>their hips were fat and round, and their breasts full and deep. And<br>endued with every auspicious mark, the amiable young ladies considered<br>themselves to be wedded to a husband who was every way worthy of<br>themselves, and extremely loved and respected Vichitravirya. And<br>Vichitravirya also, endued with the prowess of the celestials and the<br>beauty of the twin Aswins, could steal the heart of any beautiful woman.<br>And the prince passed seven years uninterruptedly in the company of his<br>wives. He was attacked while yet in the prime of youth, with phthisis.<br>Friends and relatives in consultation with one another tried to effect a<br>cure. But in spite of all efforts, the Kuru prince died, setting like the<br>evening sun. The virtuous Bhishma then became plunged into anxiety and<br>grief, and in consultation with Satyavati caused the obsequial rites of<br>the deceased to be performed by learned priests and the several of the<br>Kuru race.'"
