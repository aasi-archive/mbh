                            (Pauloma Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'O Brahmana, having heard these words from the god of fire,<br>the Rakshasa assumed the form of a boar, and seizing the lady carried her<br>away with the speed of the wind&#8212;even of thought. Then the child of<br>Bhrigu lying in her body enraged at such violence, dropped from his<br>mother's womb, for which he obtained the name of Chyavana. And the<br>Rakshasa perceiving the infant drop from the mother's womb, shining like<br>the sun, quitted his grasp of the woman, fell down and was instantly<br>converted into ashes. And the beautiful Pauloma, distracted with grief, O<br>Brahmana of the Bhrigu race, took up her offspring Chyavana, the son of<br>Bhrigu and walked away. And Brahma, the Grandfather of all, himself saw<br>her, the faultless wife of his son, weeping. And the Grandfather of all<br>comforted her who was attached to her son. And the drops of tears which<br>rolled down her eyes formed a great river. And that river began to follow<br>the foot-steps of the wife of the great ascetic Bhrigu. And the<br>Grandfather of the worlds seeing that river follow the path of his son's<br>wife gave it a name himself, and he called it Vadhusara. And it passeth<br>by the hermitage of Chyavana. And in this manner was born Chyavana of<br>great ascetic power, the son of Bhrigu.<br><br>"And Bhrigu saw his child Chyavana and its beautiful mother. And the<br>Rishi in a rage asked her, 'By whom wast thou made known to that Rakshasa<br>who resolved to carry thee away? O thou of agreeable smiles, the Rakshasa<br>could not know thee as my wile. Therefore tell me who it was that told<br>the Rakshasa so, in order that I may curse him through anger.' And<br>Pauloma replied, 'O possessor of the six attributes! I was identified to<br>the Rakshasa by Agni (the god of fire). And he (the Rakshasa) bore me<br>away, who cried like the Kurari (female osprey). And it was only by the<br>ardent splendour of this thy son that I was rescued, for the Rakshasa<br>(seeing this infant) let me go and himself falling to the ground was<br>turned into ashes.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Bhrigu, upon hearing this account from Pauloma, became<br>exceedingly enraged. And in excess of passion the Rishi cursed Agni,<br>saying, 'Thou shalt eat of all things.'"<br><br>So ends the sixth section called "the curse on Agni" in the Adi Parva.
