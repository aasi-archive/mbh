                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vasumat said, 'I am Vasumat, the son of Oshadaswa. I would ask thee, O<br>king, whether there are any worlds for me to enjoy as fruits of my<br>religious merits, in heaven or the firmament. Thou art, O high-souled<br>one, acquainted with all holy regions.'<br><br>"Yayati answered, 'There are as many regions for thee to enjoy in heaven<br>as the number of places in the firmament, the Earth and the ten points of<br>the universe illumined by the Sun.'<br><br>"Vasumat then said, 'I give them to thee. Let those regions that are for<br>me be thine. Therefore, though falling, thou shall not fall. If to accept<br>them as gift be improper for thee, then, O monarch, buy them for a straw?'<br><br>"Yayati answered, 'I do not remember having ever bought and sold anything<br>unfairly. This has never been done by other kings. How shall I therefore<br>do it?'<br><br>"Vasumat said, 'If buying them, O king, be regarded by thee as improper,<br>then take them as gilt from me. For myself I answer that I will never go<br>to those regions that are for me. Let them, therefore, be thine.'<br><br>"Sivi then addressed the king thus, I am, O king, Sivi by name, the son<br>of Usinara. O father, are there in the firmament or in heaven any worlds<br>for me to enjoy? Thou knowest every region that one may enjoy as the<br>fruit of his religious merit.'<br><br>"Yayati said, 'Thou hast never, by speech or in mind, disregarded the<br>honest and the virtuous that applied to thee. There are infinite worlds<br>for thee to enjoy in heaven, all blazing like lightning.' Sivi then said,<br>'If thou regardest their purchase as improper, I give them to thee. Take<br>them all, O king! I shall never take them, viz., those regions where the<br>wise never feel the least disquiet.'<br><br>Yayati answered, 'O Sivi, thou hast indeed, obtained for thyself,<br>possessed of the prowess of Indra, infinite worlds. But I do not desire<br>to enjoy regions given to me by others. Therefore, I accept not thy gift.'<br><br>"Ashtaka then said, 'O king, each of us has expressed his desire to give<br>thee worlds that each of us has acquired by his religious merits. Thou<br>acceptest not them. But leaving them for thee, we shall descend into the<br>Earth-hell.'<br><br>"Yayati answered, 'Ye all are truth-loving and wise. Give me that which I<br>deserve. I shall not be able to do what I have never done before.'<br><br>"Ashtaka then said, 'Whose are those five golden cars that we see? Do men<br>that repair to these regions of everlasting bliss ride in them?'<br><br>"Yayati answered, 'Those five golden cars displayed in glory, and blazing<br>as fire, would indeed, carry you to regions of bliss.'<br><br>"Ashtaka said, 'O king, ride on those cars thyself and repair to heaven.<br>We can wait. We follow thee in time.'<br><br>"Yayati said, 'We can now all go together. Indeed, all of us have<br>conquered heaven. Behold, the glorious path to heaven becomes visible."<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then all those excellent monarchs riding in<br>those cars set out for heaven for gaining admittance into it,<br>illuminating the whole firmament by the glory of their virtues.'<br><br>"Then Ashtaka, breaking the silence asked, 'I had always thought that<br>Indra was my especial friend, and that I, of all others, should first<br>obtain admittance into heaven. But how is it that Usinara's son, Sivi<br>hath already left us behind?'<br><br>"Yayati answered, 'This Usinara's son had given all he possessed for<br>attaining to the region of Brahman. Therefore, is he the foremost among<br>us. Besides, Sivi's liberality, asceticism, truth, virtue, modesty,<br>forgiveness, amiability, desire of performing good acts, have been so<br>great that none can measure them!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'After this, Ashtaka, impelled by curiosity,<br>again asked his maternal grandfather resembling Indra himself, saying, 'O<br>king, I ask thee, tell me truly, whence thou art, who thou art, and whose<br>son? Is there any other Brahmana or Kshatriya who hath done what thou<br>didst on earth?' Yayati answered, 'I tell thee truly, I am Yayati, the<br>son of Nahusha and the father of Puru. I was lord of all the Earth. Ye<br>are my relatives; I tell thee truly, I am the maternal grandfather of you<br>all. Having conquered the whole earth, I gave clothes to Brahmanas and<br>also a hundred handsome horses fit for sacrificial offering. For such<br>acts of virtue, the gods became propitious to those that perform them. I<br>also gave to Brahmanas this whole earth with her horses and elephants and<br>kine and gold all kinds of wealth, along with a hundred Arbudas of<br>excellent milch cows. Both the earth and the firmament exist owing to my<br>truth and virtue; fire yet burneth in the world of men owing to my truth<br>and virtue. Never hath a word spoken by me been untrue. It is for this<br>that the wise adore Truth. O Ashtaka, all I have told thee, Pratardana,<br>and Vasumat, is Truth itself. I know it for certain that the gods and the<br>Rishis and all the mansions of the blessed are adorable only because of<br>Truth that characteriseth them all. He that will without malice duly read<br>unto good Brahmanas his account of our ascension to heaven shall himself<br>attain to the same worlds with us.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'It was thus that the illustrious king Yayati of<br>high achievements, rescued by his collateral descendants, ascended to<br>heaven, leaving the earth and covering the three worlds with the fame of<br>his deeds.'"
