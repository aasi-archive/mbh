                            Om! Having bowed down to Narayana and Nara, the most exalted male being,<br>and also to the goddess Saraswati, must the word Jaya be uttered.<br><br>Ugrasrava, the son of Lomaharshana, surnamed Sauti, well-versed in the<br>Puranas, bending with humility, one day approached the great sages of<br>rigid vows, sitting at their ease, who had attended the twelve years'<br>sacrifice of Saunaka, surnamed Kulapati, in the forest of Naimisha. Those<br>ascetics, wishing to hear his wonderful narrations, presently began to<br>address him who had thus arrived at that recluse abode of the inhabitants<br>of the forest of Naimisha. Having been entertained with due respect by<br>those holy men, he saluted those Munis (sages) with joined palms, even<br>all of them, and inquired about the progress of their asceticism. Then<br>all the ascetics being again seated, the son of Lomaharshana humbly<br>occupied the seat that was assigned to him. Seeing that he was<br>comfortably seated, and recovered from fatigue, one of the Rishis<br>beginning the conversation, asked him, 'Whence comest thou, O lotus-eyed<br>Sauti, and where hast thou spent the time? Tell me, who ask thee, in<br>detail.'<br><br>Accomplished in speech, Sauti, thus questioned, gave in the midst of that<br>big assemblage of contemplative Munis a full and proper answer in words<br>consonant with their mode of life.<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Having heard the diverse sacred and wonderful stories which<br>were composed in his Mahabharata by Krishna-Dwaipayana, and which were<br>recited in full by Vaisampayana at the Snake-sacrifice of the high-souled<br>royal sage Janamejaya and in the presence also of that chief of Princes,<br>the son of Parikshit, and having wandered about, visiting many sacred<br>waters and holy shrines, I journeyed to the country venerated by the<br>Dwijas (twice-born) and called Samantapanchaka where formerly was fought<br>the battle between the children of Kuru and Pandu, and all the chiefs of<br>the land ranged on either side. Thence, anxious to see you, I am come<br>into your presence. Ye reverend sages, all of whom are to me as Brahma;<br>ye greatly blessed who shine in this place of sacrifice with the<br>splendour of the solar fire: ye who have concluded the silent meditations<br>and have fed the holy fire; and yet who are sitting&#8212;without care, what,<br>O ye Dwijas (twice-born), shall I repeat, shall I recount the sacred<br>stories collected in the Puranas containing precepts of religious duty<br>and of worldly profit, or the acts of illustrious saints and sovereigns<br>of mankind?"<br><br>"The Rishi replied, 'The Purana, first promulgated by the great Rishi<br>Dwaipayana, and which after having been heard both by the gods and the<br>Brahmarshis was highly esteemed, being the most eminent narrative that<br>exists, diversified both in diction and division, possessing subtile<br>meanings logically combined, and gleaned from the Vedas, is a sacred<br>work. Composed in elegant language, it includeth the subjects of other<br>books. It is elucidated by other Shastras, and comprehendeth the sense of<br>the four Vedas. We are desirous of hearing that history also called<br>Bharata, the holy composition of the wonderful Vyasa, which dispelleth<br>the fear of evil, just as it was cheerfully recited by the Rishi<br>Vaisampayana, under the direction of Dwaipayana himself, at the<br>snake-sacrifice of Raja Janamejaya?'<br><br>"Sauti then said, 'Having bowed down to the primordial being Isana, to<br>whom multitudes make offerings, and who is adored by the multitude; who<br>is the true incorruptible one, Brahma, perceptible, imperceptible,<br>eternal; who is both a non-existing and an existing-non-existing being;<br>who is the universe and also distinct from the existing and non-existing<br>universe; who is the creator of high and low; the ancient, exalted,<br>inexhaustible one; who is Vishnu, beneficent and the beneficence itself,<br>worthy of all preference, pure and immaculate; who is Hari, the ruler of<br>the faculties, the guide of all things moveable and immoveable; I will<br>declare the sacred thoughts of the illustrious sage Vyasa, of marvellous<br>deeds and worshipped here by all. Some bards have already published this<br>history, some are now teaching it, and others, in like manner, will<br>hereafter promulgate it upon the earth. It is a great source of<br>knowledge, established throughout the three regions of the world. It is<br>possessed by the twice-born both in detailed and compendious forms. It is<br>the delight of the learned for being embellished with elegant<br>expressions, conversations human and divine, and a variety of poetical<br>measures.<br><br>In this world, when it was destitute of brightness and light, and<br>enveloped all around in total darkness, there came into being, as the<br>primal cause of creation, a mighty egg, the one inexhaustible seed of all<br>created beings. It is called Mahadivya, and was formed at the beginning<br>of the Yuga, in which we are told, was the true light Brahma, the eternal<br>one, the wonderful and inconceivable being present alike in all places;<br>the invisible and subtile cause, whose nature partaketh of entity and<br>non-entity. From this egg came out the lord Pitamaha Brahma, the one only<br>Prajapati; with Suraguru and Sthanu. Then appeared the twenty-one<br>Prajapatis, viz., Manu, Vasishtha and Parameshthi; ten Prachetas, Daksha,<br>and the seven sons of Daksha. Then appeared the man of inconceivable<br>nature whom all the Rishis know and so the Viswe-devas, the Adityas, the<br>Vasus, and the twin Aswins; the Yakshas, the Sadhyas, the Pisachas, the<br>Guhyakas, and the Pitris. After these were produced the wise and most<br>holy Brahmarshis, and the numerous Rajarshis distinguished by every noble<br>quality. So the water, the heavens, the earth, the air, the sky, the<br>points of the heavens, the years, the seasons, the months, the<br>fortnights, called Pakshas, with day and night in due succession. And<br>thus were produced all things which are known to mankind.<br><br>And what is seen in the universe, whether animate or inanimate, of<br>created things, will at the end of the world, and after the expiration of<br>the Yuga, be again confounded. And, at the commencement of other Yugas,<br>all things will be renovated, and, like the various fruits of the earth,<br>succeed each other in the due order of their seasons. Thus continueth<br>perpetually to revolve in the world, without beginning and without end,<br>this wheel which causeth the destruction of all things.<br><br>The generation of Devas, in brief, was thirty-three thousand,<br>thirty-three hundred and thirty-three. The sons of Div were Brihadbhanu,<br>Chakshus, Atma Vibhavasu, Savita, Richika, Arka, Bhanu, Asavaha, and<br>Ravi. Of these Vivaswans of old, Mahya was the youngest whose son was<br>Deva-vrata. The latter had for his son, Su-vrata who, we learn, had three<br>sons,&#8212;Dasa-jyoti, Sata-jyoti, and Sahasra-jyoti, each of them producing<br>numerous offspring. The illustrious Dasa-jyoti had ten thousand,<br>Sata-jyoti ten times that number, and Sahasra-jyoti ten times the number<br>of Sata-jyoti's offspring. From these are descended the family of the<br>Kurus, of the Yadus, and of Bharata; the family of Yayati and of<br>Ikshwaku; also of all the Rajarshis. Numerous also were the generations<br>produced, and very abundant were the creatures and their places of abode.<br>The mystery which is threefold&#8212;the Vedas, Yoga, and Vijnana Dharma,<br>Artha, and Kama&#8212;also various books upon the subject of Dharma, Artha,<br>and Kama; also rules for the conduct of mankind; also histories and<br>discourses with various srutis; all of which having been seen by the<br>Rishi Vyasa are here in due order mentioned as a specimen of the book.<br><br>The Rishi Vyasa published this mass of knowledge in both a detailed and<br>an abridged form. It is the wish of the learned in the world to possess<br>the details and the abridgement. Some read the Bharata beginning with the<br>initial mantra (invocation), others with the story of Astika, others with<br>Uparichara, while some Brahmanas study the whole. Men of learning display<br>their various knowledge of the institutes in commenting on the<br>composition. Some are skilful in explaining it, while others, in<br>remembering its contents.<br><br>The son of Satyavati having, by penance and meditation, analysed the<br>eternal Veda, afterwards composed this holy history, when that learned<br>Brahmarshi of strict vows, the noble Dwaipayana Vyasa, offspring of<br>Parasara, had finished this greatest of narrations, he began to consider<br>how he might teach it to his disciples. And the possessor of the six<br>attributes, Brahma, the world's preceptor, knowing of the anxiety of the<br>Rishi Dwaipayana, came in person to the place where the latter was, for<br>gratifying the saint, and benefiting the people. And when Vyasa,<br>surrounded by all the tribes of Munis, saw him, he was surprised; and,<br>standing with joined palms, he bowed and ordered a seat to be brought.<br>And Vyasa having gone round him who is called Hiranyagarbha seated on<br>that distinguished seat stood near it; and being commanded by Brahma<br>Parameshthi, he sat down near the seat, full of affection and smiling in<br>joy. Then the greatly glorious Vyasa, addressing Brahma Parameshthi,<br>said, "O divine Brahma, by me a poem hath been composed which is greatly<br>respected. The mystery of the Veda, and what other subjects have been<br>explained by me; the various rituals of the Upanishads with the Angas;<br>the compilation of the Puranas and history formed by me and named after<br>the three divisions of time, past, present, and future; the determination<br>of the nature of decay, fear, disease, existence, and non-existence, a<br>description of creeds and of the various modes of life; rule for the four<br>castes, and the import of all the Puranas; an account of asceticism and<br>of the duties of a religious student; the dimensions of the sun and moon,<br>the planets, constellations, and stars, together with the duration of the<br>four ages; the Rik, Sama and Yajur Vedas; also the Adhyatma; the sciences<br>called Nyaya, Orthoephy and Treatment of diseases; charity and<br>Pasupatadharma; birth celestial and human, for particular purposes; also<br>a description of places of pilgrimage and other holy places of rivers,<br>mountains, forests, the ocean, of heavenly cities and the kalpas; the art<br>of war; the different kinds of nations and languages: the nature of the<br>manners of the people; and the all-pervading spirit;&#8212;all these have been<br>represented. But, after all, no writer of this work is to be found on<br>earth.'<br><br>"Brahma said. 'I esteem thee for thy knowledge of divine mysteries,<br>before the whole body of celebrated Munis distinguished for the sanctity<br>of their lives. I know thou hast revealed the divine word, even from its<br>first utterance, in the language of truth. Thou hast called thy present<br>work a poem, wherefore it shall be a poem. There shall be no poets whose<br>works may equal the descriptions of this poem, even, as the three other<br>modes called Asrama are ever unequal in merit to the domestic Asrama. Let<br>Ganesa be thought of, O Muni, for the purpose of writing the poem.'<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Brahma having thus spoken to Vyasa, retired to his own<br>abode. Then Vyasa began to call to mind Ganesa. And Ganesa, obviator of<br>obstacles, ready to fulfil the desires of his votaries, was no sooner<br>thought of, than he repaired to the place where Vyasa was seated. And<br>when he had been saluted, and was seated, Vyasa addressed him thus, 'O<br>guide of the Ganas! be thou the writer of the Bharata which I have formed<br>in my imagination, and which I am about to repeat."<br><br>"Ganesa, upon hearing this address, thus answered, 'I will become the<br>writer of thy work, provided my pen do not for a moment cease writing."<br>And Vyasa said unto that divinity, 'Wherever there be anything thou dost<br>not comprehend, cease to continue writing.' Ganesa having signified his<br>assent, by repeating the word Om! proceeded to write; and Vyasa began;<br>and by way of diversion, he knit the knots of composition exceeding<br>close; by doing which, he dictated this work according to his engagement.<br><br>I am (continued Sauti) acquainted with eight thousand and eight hundred<br>verses, and so is Suka, and perhaps Sanjaya. From the mysteriousness of<br>their meaning, O Muni, no one is able, to this day, to penetrate those<br>closely knit difficult slokas. Even the omniscient Ganesa took a moment<br>to consider; while Vyasa, however, continued to compose other verses in<br>great abundance.<br><br>The wisdom of this work, like unto an instrument of applying collyrium,<br>hath opened the eyes of the inquisitive world blinded by the darkness of<br>ignorance. As the sun dispelleth the darkness, so doth the Bharata by its<br>discourses on religion, profit, pleasure and final release, dispel the<br>ignorance of men. As the full-moon by its mild light expandeth the buds<br>of the water-lily, so this Purana, by exposing the light of the Sruti<br>hath expanded the human intellect. By the lamp of history, which<br>destroyeth the darkness of ignorance, the whole mansion of nature is<br>properly and completely illuminated.<br><br>This work is a tree, of which the chapter of contents is the seed; the<br>divisions called Pauloma and Astika are the root; the part called<br>Sambhava is the trunk; the books called Sabha and Aranya are the roosting<br>perches; the books called Arani is the knitting knots; the books called<br>Virata and Udyoga the pith; the book named Bhishma, the main branch; the<br>book called Drona, the leaves; the book called Karna, the fair flowers;<br>the book named Salya, their sweet smell; the books entitled Stri and<br>Aishika, the refreshing shade; the book called Santi, the mighty fruit;<br>the book called Aswamedha, the immortal sap; the denominated<br>Asramavasika, the spot where it groweth; and the book called Mausala, is<br>an epitome of the Vedas and held in great respect by the virtuous<br>Brahmanas. The tree of the Bharata, inexhaustible to mankind as the<br>clouds, shall be as a source of livelihood to all distinguished poets."<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'I will now speak of the undying flowery and fruitful<br>productions of this tree, possessed of pure and pleasant taste, and not<br>to be destroyed even by the immortals. Formerly, the spirited and<br>virtuous Krishna-Dwaipayana, by the injunctions of Bhishma, the wise son<br>of Ganga and of his own mother, became the father of three boys who were<br>like the three fires by the two wives of Vichitra-virya; and having thus<br>raised up Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidura, he returned to his recluse<br>abode to prosecute his religious exercise.<br><br>It was not till after these were born, grown up, and departed on the<br>supreme journey, that the great Rishi Vyasa published the Bharata in this<br>region of mankind; when being solicited by Janamejaya and thousands of<br>Brahmanas, he instructed his disciple Vaisampayana, who was seated near<br>him; and he, sitting together with the Sadasyas, recited the Bharata,<br>during the intervals of the ceremonies of the sacrifice, being repeatedly<br>urged to proceed.<br><br>Vyasa hath fully represented the greatness of the house of Kuru, the<br>virtuous principles of Gandhari, the wisdom of Vidura, and the constancy<br>of Kunti. The noble Rishi hath also described the divinity of Vasudeva,<br>the rectitude of the sons of Pandu, and the evil practices of the sons<br>and partisans of Dhritarashtra.<br><br>Vyasa executed the compilation of the Bharata, exclusive of the episodes<br>originally in twenty-four thousand verses; and so much only is called by<br>the learned as the Bharata. Afterwards, he composed an epitome in one<br>hundred and fifty verses, consisting of the introduction with the chapter<br>of contents. This he first taught to his son Suka; and afterwards he gave<br>it to others of his disciples who were possessed of the same<br>qualifications. After that he executed another compilation, consisting of<br>six hundred thousand verses. Of those, thirty hundred thousand are known<br>in the world of the Devas; fifteen hundred thousand in the world of the<br>Pitris: fourteen hundred thousand among the Gandharvas, and one hundred<br>thousand in the regions of mankind. Narada recited them to the Devas,<br>Devala to the Pitris, and Suka published them to the Gandharvas, Yakshas,<br>and Rakshasas: and in this world they were recited by Vaisampayana, one<br>of the disciples of Vyasa, a man of just principles and the first among<br>all those acquainted with the Vedas. Know that I, Sauti, have also<br>repeated one hundred thousand verses.<br><br>Yudhishthira is a vast tree, formed of religion and virtue; Arjuna is its<br>trunk; Bhimasena, its branches; the two sons of Madri are its full-grown<br>fruit and flowers; and its roots are Krishna, Brahma, and the Brahmanas.<br><br>Pandu, after having subdued many countries by his wisdom and prowess,<br>took up his abode with the Munis in a certain forest as a sportsman,<br>where he brought upon himself a very severe misfortune for having killed<br>a stag coupling with its mate, which served as a warning for the conduct<br>of the princes of his house as long as they lived. Their mothers, in<br>order that the ordinances of the law might be fulfilled, admitted as<br>substitutes to their embraces the gods Dharma, Vayu, Sakra, and the<br>divinities the twin Aswins. And when their offspring grew up, under the<br>care of their two mothers, in the society of ascetics, in the midst of<br>sacred groves and holy recluse-abodes of religious men, they were<br>conducted by Rishis into the presence of Dhritarashtra and his sons,<br>following as students in the habit of Brahmacharis, having their hair<br>tied in knots on their heads. 'These our pupils', said they, 'are as your<br>sons, your brothers, and your friends; they are Pandavas.' Saying this,<br>the Munis disappeared.<br><br>When the Kauravas saw them introduced as the sons of Pandu, the<br>distinguished class of citizens shouted exceedingly for joy. Some,<br>however, said, they were not the sons of Pandu; others said, they were;<br>while a few asked how they could be his offspring, seeing he had been so<br>long dead. Still on all sides voices were heard crying, 'They are on all<br>accounts welcome! Through divine Providence we behold the family of<br>Pandu! Let their welcome be proclaimed!' As these acclamations ceased,<br>the plaudits of invisible spirits, causing every point of the heavens to<br>resound, were tremendous. There were showers of sweet-scented flowers,<br>and the sound of shells and kettle-drums. Such were the wonders that<br>happened on the arrival of the young princes. The joyful noise of all the<br>citizens, in expression of their satisfaction on the occasion, was so<br>great that it reached the very heavens in magnifying plaudits.<br><br>Having studied the whole of the Vedas and sundry other shastras, the<br>Pandavas resided there, respected by all and without apprehension from<br>any one.<br><br>The principal men were pleased with the purity of Yudhishthira, the<br>courage of Arjuna, the submissive attention of Kunti to her superiors,<br>and the humility of the twins, Nakula and Sahadeva; and all the people<br>rejoiced in their heroic virtues.<br><br>After a while, Arjuna obtained the virgin Krishna at the swayamvara, in<br>the midst of a concourse of Rajas, by performing a very difficult feat of<br>archery. And from this time he became very much respected in this world<br>among all bowmen; and in fields of battle also, like the sun, he was hard<br>to behold by foe-men. And having vanquished all the neighbouring princes<br>and every considerable tribe, he accomplished all that was necessary for<br>the Raja (his eldest brother) to perform the great sacrifice called<br>Rajasuya.<br><br>Yudhishthira, after having, through the wise counsels of Vasudeva and by<br>the valour of Bhimasena and Arjuna, slain Jarasandha (the king of<br>Magadha) and the proud Chaidya, acquired the right to perform the grand<br>sacrifice of Rajasuya abounding in provisions and offering and fraught<br>with transcendent merits. And Duryodhana came to this sacrifice; and when<br>he beheld the vast wealth of the Pandavas scattered all around, the<br>offerings, the precious stones, gold and jewels; the wealth in cows,<br>elephants, and horses; the curious textures, garments, and mantles; the<br>precious shawls and furs and carpets made of the skin of the Ranku; he<br>was filled with envy and became exceedingly displeased. And when he<br>beheld the hall of assembly elegantly constructed by Maya (the Asura<br>architect) after the fashion of a celestial court, he was inflamed with<br>rage. And having started in confusion at certain architectural deceptions<br>within this building, he was derided by Bhimasena in the presence of<br>Vasudeva, like one of mean descent.<br><br>And it was represented to Dhritarashtra that his son, while partaking of<br>various objects of enjoyment and diverse precious things, was becoming<br>meagre, wan, and pale. And Dhritarashtra, some time after, out of<br>affection for his son, gave his consent to their playing (with the<br>Pandavas) at dice. And Vasudeva coming to know of this, became<br>exceedingly wroth. And being dissatisfied, he did nothing to prevent the<br>disputes, but overlooked the gaming and sundry other horried<br>unjustifiable transactions arising therefrom: and in spite of Vidura,<br>Bhishma, Drona, and Kripa, the son of Saradwan, he made the Kshatriyas<br>kill each other in the terrific war that ensued.'<br><br>"And Dhritarashtra hearing the ill news of the success of the Pandavas<br>and recollecting the resolutions of Duryodhana, Kama, and Sakuni,<br>pondered for a while and addressed to Sanjaya the following speech:&#8212;<br><br>'Attend, O Sanjaya, to all I am about to say, and it will not become thee<br>to treat me with contempt. Thou art well-versed in the shastras,<br>intelligent and endowed with wisdom. My inclination was never to war, not<br>did I delight in the destruction of my race. I made no distinction<br>between my own children and the children of Pandu. My own sons were prone<br>to wilfulness and despised me because I am old. Blind as I am, because of<br>my miserable plight and through paternal affection, I bore it all. I was<br>foolish alter the thoughtless Duryodhana ever growing in folly. Having<br>been a spectator of the riches of the mighty sons of Pandu, my son was<br>derided for his awkwardness while ascending the hall. Unable to bear it<br>all and unable himself to overcome the sons of Pandu in the field, and<br>though a soldier, unwilling yet to obtain good fortune by his own<br>exertion, with the help of the king of Gandhara he concerted an unfair<br>game at dice.<br><br>'Hear, O Sanjaya, all that happened thereupon and came to my knowledge.<br>And when thou hast heard all I say, recollecting everything as it fell<br>out, thou shall then know me for one with a prophetic eye. When I heard<br>that Arjuna, having bent the bow, had pierced the curious mark and<br>brought it down to the ground, and bore away in triumph the maiden<br>Krishna, in the sight of the assembled princes, then, O Sanjaya I had no<br>hope of success. When I heard that Subhadra of the race of Madhu had,<br>after forcible seizure been married by Arjuna in the city of Dwaraka, and<br>that the two heroes of the race of Vrishni (Krishna and Balarama the<br>brothers of Subhadra) without resenting it had entered Indraprastha as<br>friends, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard that<br>Arjuna, by his celestial arrow preventing the downpour by Indra the king<br>of the gods, had gratified Agni by making over to him the forest of<br>Khandava, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard that<br>the five Pandavas with their mother Kunti had escaped from the house of<br>lac, and that Vidura was engaged in the accomplishment of their designs,<br>then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard that Arjuna,<br>after having pierced the mark in the arena had won Draupadi, and that the<br>brave Panchalas had joined the Pandavas, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope<br>of success. When I heard that Jarasandha, the foremost of the royal line<br>of Magadha, and blazing in the midst of the Kshatriyas, had been slain by<br>Bhima with his bare arms alone, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of<br>success.

All around me is utter<br>darkness, and a fit of swoon assaileth me: consciousness leaves me, O<br>Suta, and my mind is distracted."<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Dhritarashtra, bewailing his fate in these words, was<br>overcome with extreme anguish and for a time deprived of sense; but being<br>revived, he addressed Sanjaya in the following words.<br><br>"After what hath come to pass, O Sanjaya, I wish to put an end to my life<br>without delay; I do not find the least advantage in cherishing it any<br>longer."<br><br>"Sauti said, 'The wise son of Gavalgana (Sanjaya) then addressed the<br>distressed lord of Earth while thus talking and bewailing, sighing like a<br>serpent and repeatedly tainting, in words of deep import.<br><br>"Thou hast heard, O Raja, of the greatly powerful men of vast exertions,<br>spoken of by Vyasa and the wise Narada; men born of great royal families,<br>resplendent with worthy qualities, versed in the science of celestial<br>arms, and in glory emblems of Indra; men who having conquered the world<br>by justice and performed sacrifices with fit offerings (to the<br>Brahmanas), obtained renown in this world and at last succumbed to the<br>sway of time. Such were Saivya; the valiant Maharatha; Srinjaya, great<br>amongst conquerors. Suhotra; Rantideva, and Kakshivanta, great in glory;<br>Valhika, Damana, Saryati, Ajita, and Nala; Viswamitra the destroyer of<br>foes; Amvarisha, great in strength; Marutta, Manu, Ikshaku, Gaya, and<br>Bharata; Rama the son of Dasaratha; Sasavindu, and Bhagiratha;<br>Kritavirya, the greatly fortunate, and Janamejaya too; and Yayati of good<br>deeds who performed sacrifices, being assisted therein by the celestials<br>themselves, and by whose sacrificial altars and stakes this earth with<br>her habited and uninhabited regions hath been marked all over. These<br>twenty-four Rajas were formerly spoken of by the celestial Rishi Narada<br>unto Saivya when much afflicted for the loss of his children. Besides<br>these, other Rajas had gone before, still more powerful than they, mighty<br>charioteers noble in mind, and resplendent with every worthy quality.<br>These were Puru, Kuru, Yadu, Sura and Viswasrawa of great glory; Anuha,<br>Yuvanaswu, Kakutstha, Vikrami, and Raghu; Vijava, Virihorta, Anga, Bhava,<br>Sweta, and Vripadguru; Usinara, Sata-ratha, Kanka, Duliduha, and Druma;<br>Dambhodbhava, Para, Vena, Sagara, Sankriti, and Nimi; Ajeya, Parasu,<br>Pundra, Sambhu, and holy Deva-Vridha; Devahuya, Supratika, and<br>Vrihad-ratha; Mahatsaha, Vinitatma, Sukratu, and Nala, the king of the<br>Nishadas; Satyavrata, Santabhaya, Sumitra, and the chief Subala;<br>Janujangha, Anaranya, Arka, Priyabhritya, Chuchi-vrata, Balabandhu,<br>Nirmardda, Ketusringa, and Brhidbala; Dhrishtaketu, Brihatketu,<br>Driptaketu, and Niramaya; Abikshit, Chapala, Dhurta, Kritbandhu, and<br>Dridhe-shudhi; Mahapurana-sambhavya, Pratyanga, Paraha and Sruti. These,<br>O chief, and other Rajas, we hear enumerated by hundreds and by<br>thousands, and still others by millions, princes of great power and<br>wisdom, quitting very abundant enjoyments met death as thy sons have<br>done! Their heavenly deeds, valour, and generosity, their magnanimity,<br>faith, truth, purity, simplicity and mercy, are published to the world in<br>the records of former times by sacred bards of great learning. Though<br>endued with every noble virtue, these have yielded up their lives. Thy<br>sons were malevolent, inflamed with passion, avaricious, and of very<br>evil-disposition. Thou art versed in the Sastras, O Bharata, and art<br>intelligent and wise; they never sink under misfortunes whose<br>understandings are guided by the Sastras. Thou art acquainted, O prince,<br>with the lenity and severity of fate; this anxiety therefore for the<br>safety of thy children is unbecoming. Moreover, it behoveth thee not to<br>grieve for that which must happen: for who can avert, by his wisdom, the<br>decrees of fate? No one can leave the way marked out for him by<br>Providence. Existence and non-existence, pleasure and pain all have Time<br>for their root. Time createth all things and Time destroyeth all<br>creatures. It is Time that burneth creatures and it is Time that<br>extinguisheth the fire. All states, the good and the evil, in the three<br>worlds, are caused by Time. Time cutteth short all things and createth<br>them anew. Time alone is awake when all things are asleep: indeed, Time<br>is incapable of being overcome. Time passeth over all things without<br>being retarded. Knowing, as thou dost, that all things past and future<br>and all that exist at the present moment, are the offspring of Time, it<br>behoveth thee not to throw away thy reason.'<br><br>"Sauti said, 'The son of Gavalgana having in this manner administered<br>comfort to the royal Dhritarashtra overwhelmed with grief for his sons,<br>then restored his mind to peace. Taking these facts for his subject,<br>Dwaipayana composed a holy Upanishad that has been published to the world<br>by learned and sacred bards in the Puranas composed by them.<br><br>"The study of the Bharata is an act of piety. He that readeth even one<br>foot, with belief, hath his sins entirely purged away. Herein Devas,<br>Devarshis, and immaculate Brahmarshis of good deeds, have been spoken of;<br>and likewise Yakshas and great Uragas (Nagas). Herein also hath been<br>described the eternal Vasudeva possessing the six attributes. He is the<br>true and just, the pure and holy, the eternal Brahma, the supreme soul,<br>the true constant light, whose divine deeds wise and learned recount;<br>from whom hath proceeded the non-existent and existent-non-existent<br>universe with principles of generation and progression, and birth, death<br>and re-birth. That also hath been treated of which is called Adhyatma<br>(the superintending spirit of nature) that partaketh of the attributes of<br>the five elements. That also hath been described who is purusha being<br>above such epithets as 'undisplayed' and the like; also that which the<br>foremost yatis exempt from the common destiny and endued with the power<br>of meditation and Tapas behold dwelling in their hearts as a reflected<br>image in the mirror.<br><br>"The man of faith, devoted to piety, and constant in the exercise of<br>virtue, on reading this section is freed from sin. The believer that<br>constantly heareth recited this section of the Bharata, called the<br>Introduction, from the beginning, falleth not into difficulties. The man<br>repeating any part of the introduction in the two twilights is during<br>such act freed from the sins contracted during the day or the night. This<br>section, the body of the Bharata, is truth and nectar. As butter is in<br>curd, Brahmana among bipeds, the Aranyaka among the Vedas, and nectar<br>among medicines; as the sea is eminent among receptacles of water, and<br>the cow among quadrupeds; as are these (among the things mentioned) so is<br>the Bharata said to be among histories.<br><br>"He that causeth it, even a single foot thereof, to be recited to<br>Brahmanas during a Sradha, his offerings of food and drink to the manes<br>of his ancestors become inexhaustible.<br><br>"By the aid of history and the Puranas, the Veda may be expounded; but<br>the Veda is afraid of one of little information lest he should it. The<br>learned man who recites to other this Veda of Vyasa reapeth advantage. It<br>may without doubt destroy even the sin of killing the embryo and the<br>like. He that readeth this holy chapter of the moon, readeth the whole of<br>the Bharata, I ween. The man who with reverence daily listeneth to this<br>sacred work acquireth long life and renown and ascendeth to heaven.<br><br>"In former days, having placed the four Vedas on one side and the Bharata<br>on the other, these were weighed in the balance by the celestials<br>assembled for that purpose. And as the latter weighed heavier than the<br>four Vedas with their mysteries, from that period it hath been called in<br>the world Mahabharata (the great Bharata). Being esteemed superior both<br>in substance and gravity of import it is denominated Mahabharata on<br>account of such substance and gravity of import. He that knoweth its<br>meaning is saved from all his sins.<br><br>'Tapa is innocent, study is harmless, the ordinance of the Vedas<br>prescribed for all the tribes are harmless, the acquisition of wealth by<br>exertion is harmless; but when they are abused in their practices it is<br>then that they become sources of evil.'"
