                            (Swayamvara Parva)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then those tigers among men&#8212;those brothers&#8212;the<br>five Pandavas, set out for Panchala to behold that country and Draupadi<br>and the festivities (in view of her marriage). And those tigers among<br>men&#8212;those oppressors of all enemies&#8212;in going along with their mother,<br>saw on the way numerous Brahmanas proceeding together. And those<br>Brahmanas who were all Brahmacharis beholding the Pandavas, O king, asked<br>them, 'Where are ye going to? Whence also are ye come?' And Yudhishthira<br>replied unto them, saying, 'Ye bulls among Brahmanas, know ye that we are<br>uterine brothers proceeding together with our mother. We are coming even<br>from Ekachakra.' The Brahmanas then said, 'Go ye this very day to the<br>abode of Drupada in the country of the Panchalas. A great Swayamvara<br>takes place there, on which a large sum of money will be spent. We also<br>are proceeding thither. Let us all go together. Extraordinary festivities<br>will take place (in Drupada's abode). The illustrious Yajnasena,<br>otherwise called Drupada, had a daughter risen from the centre of the<br>sacrificial altar. Of eyes like lotus-petals and of faultless features<br>endued with youth and intelligence, she is extremely beautiful. And the<br>slender-waisted Draupadi of every feature perfectly faultless, and whose<br>body emitteth a fragrance like unto that of the blue lotus for two full<br>miles around, is the sister of the strong-armed Dhrishtadyumna gifted<br>with great prowess&#8212;the (would-be) slayer of Drona&#8212;who was born with<br>natural mail and sword and bow and arrows from the blazing fire, himself<br>like unto the second Fire. And that daughter of Yajnasena will select a<br>husband from among the invited princes. And we are repairing thither to<br>behold her and the festivities on the occasion, like unto the festivities<br>of heaven. And to that Swayamvara will come from various lands kings and<br>princes who are performers of sacrifices in which the presents to the<br>Brahmanas are large: who are devoted to study, are holy, illustrious, and<br>of rigid vows; who are young and handsome; and who are mighty<br>car-warriors and accomplished in arms. Desirous of winning (the hand of)<br>the maiden those monarchs will all give away much wealth and kine and<br>food and other articles of enjoyment. And taking all they will give away<br>and witnessing the Swayamvara, and enjoying the festivities, we shall go<br>wheresoever we like. And there will also come unto that Swayamvara, from<br>various countries, actors, and bards singing the panegyrics of kings, and<br>dancers, and reciters of Puranas, and heralds, and powerful athletes. And<br>beholding all these sights and taking what will be given away to<br>illustrious ones, ye will return with us. Ye are all handsome and like<br>unto the celestials! Beholding you, Krishna may, by chance, choose some<br>one amongst you superior to the rest. This thy brother of mighty arms and<br>handsome and endued with beauty also, engaged in (athletic) encounters,<br>may, by chance, earn great wealth.'<br><br>"On hearing these words of the Brahmanas, Yudhishthira replied, 'Ye<br>Brahmanas, we will all go with you to witness that maiden's<br>Swayamvara&#8212;that excellent jubilee.'"
