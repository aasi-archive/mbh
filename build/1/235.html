                            (Khandava-daha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'O thou of Kuru's race, the Rishi Mandapala became<br>very anxious about his children, although he had spoken of them to the<br>god of fierce rays. Indeed, his mind was not in peace. Distressed on<br>account of his sons, he addressed Lapita (his second wife with whom he<br>then was), saying, 'O Lapita, as my children are incapable of the power<br>of moving, how are they? When the fire will grow in strength and the wind<br>begin to blow violently, my children will scarcely be able to save<br>themselves. How will their mother be able to rescue them? That innocent<br>woman will be afflicted with great sorrow when she will find herself<br>unable to save her offspring. Oh, how will she compose herself, uttering<br>various lamentations on account of my children who are all incapable of<br>taking wing or rising up into the air. Oh, how is Jaritari, my son, and<br>how is Sarisrikka, and how is Stamvamitra, and how is Drona, and how also<br>is their helpless mother?'<br><br>"Unto the Rishi Mandapala thus weeping in the forest, Lapita, O Bharata,<br>thus replied, under the influence of jealousy, 'Thou need not worry for<br>thy children who, as thou hast assured me, are all Rishis endued with<br>energy and prowess! They can have no fear from fire. Didst thou not speak<br>to Agni in my presence, in their behalf? Has not the illustrious deity<br>promised to save them? One of the regents of the universe as Agni is, he<br>will never falsify his speech. Thou hast no anxiety, nor is thy heart<br>inclined towards benefiting friends. It is only by thinking of her&#8212;my<br>rival (Jarita) that thou art so distracted! Certain it is that the love<br>thou bearest to me is not equal to what thou hadst for her at first. He<br>that hath two parties dividing his attention, can easily behold one of<br>those suffer all sorts of pangs; but he should not disregard the party<br>that is next to his heart. Then go thou to Jarita, for whom thy heart is<br>sorrowing! As for myself, I shall henceforth wander alone, as a fit<br>reward for my having attached myself to a wicked person.'<br><br>"Hearing these words, Mandapala replied, 'I do not wander over the earth<br>with such intentions as thou conceivest. It is only for the sake of<br>progeny that I am here. And even those that I have are in danger. He who<br>casteth off what he hath for the sake of what he may acquire, is a wicked<br>person. The world disregardeth and insulteth him. (Therefore, go I must).<br>As for thyself thou art free to do what thou choosest. This blazing fire<br>that licketh up the trees causeth sorrow in my anxious heart and raiseth<br>therein evil presentiments.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Meanwhile, after the fire had left the spot<br>where the Sarngakas dwelt, Jarita, much attached to her children, hastily<br>came thither to see how they were. She found that all of them had escaped<br>from the fire and were perfectly well. Beholding their mother, they began<br>to weep, though safe and sound. She too shed tears upon beholding them<br>alive. And she embraced, one by one, all her weeping children. Just at<br>that time, O Bharata, the Rishi Mandapala arrived there. But none of his<br>sons expressed joy, upon beholding him. The Rishi, however, began to<br>speak to them one after another and unto Jarita also, repeatedly. But<br>neither his sons nor Jarita spoke anything well or ill unto him in<br>return.'<br><br>"Mandapala then said, 'Who amongst these is thy first born, and who the<br>next after him? And who is the third, and who the youngest? I am speaking<br>unto thee woefully; why dost thou not reply to me? I left thee, it is<br>true, but I was not happy where I was.'<br><br>"Jarita then said, 'What hast thou to do with the eldest of these, and<br>what with him that is next? And what with the third and what with the<br>youngest? Go now unto that Lapita of sweet smiles and endued with youth,<br>unto whom thou didst go of old, beholding me deficient in everything!'<br>Mandapala replied, 'As regards females, there is nothing so destructive<br>of their happiness whether in this or the other world as a co-wife and a<br>clandestine lover. There is nothing like these two that, inflames the<br>fire of hostility and causes such anxiety. Even the auspicious and<br>well-behaved Arundhati, celebrated amongst all creatures, had been<br>jealous of the illustrious Vasishtha of great purity of mind and always<br>devoted to the good of his wife. Arundhati insulted even the wise Muni<br>amongst the (celestial) seven. In consequence of such insulting thoughts<br>of hers, she has become a little star, like fire mixed with smoke,<br>sometimes visible and sometimes invisible, like an omen portending no<br>good (amongst a constellation of seven bright stars representing the<br>seven Rishis). I look to thee for the sake of children. I never wronged<br>thee, like Vasishtha who never wronged his wife. Thou hast, therefore, by<br>thy jealousy behaved towards me like Arundhati of old towards Vasishtha.<br>Men should never trust women even if they be wives. Women, when they have<br>become mothers, do not much mind serving their husbands.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'After this, all his children came forward to<br>worship him. And he also began to speak kindly towards them all, giving<br>them every assurance.'"
