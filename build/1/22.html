                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'The Nagas after consultation arrived at the conclusion that<br>they should do their mother's bidding, for if she failed in obtaining her<br>desire she might withdraw her affection and burn them all. If, on the<br>other hand, she were graciously inclined, she might free them from her<br>curse. They said, 'We will certainly render the horse's tail black.' And<br>it is said that they then went and became hairs in the horse's tail.<br><br>"Now the two co-wives had laid the wager. And having laid the wager, O<br>best of Brahmanas, the two sisters Kadru and Vinata, the daughters of<br>Daksha, proceeded in great delight along the sky to see the other side of<br>the Ocean. And on their way they saw the Ocean, that receptacle of<br>waters, incapable of being easily disturbed, mightily agitated all of a<br>sudden by the wind, and roaring tremendously; abounding with fishes<br>capable of swallowing the whale and full of makaras; containing also<br>creatures of diverse forms counted by thousands; frightful from the<br>presence of horrible monsters, inaccessible, deep, and terrible, the mine<br>of all kinds of gems, the home of Varuna (the water-god), the wonderful<br>habitations of the Nagas, the lord of rivers, the abode of the<br>subterranean fire; the residence of the Asuras and of many dreadful<br>creatures; the reservoir of water, not subject to decay, aromatic, and<br>wonderful, the great source of the amrita of the celestials; immeasurable<br>and inconceivable, containing waters that are holy, filled to the brim by<br>many thousands of great rivers, dancing as it were in waves. Such was the<br>Ocean, full of rolling waves, vast as the expanse of the sky, deep, of<br>body lighted with the flames of subterranean fire, and roaring, which the<br>sisters quickly passed over.'"<br><br>And so ends the twenty-second section in the Astika Parva of the Adi<br>Parva.
