                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'On hearing that the heroic sons of Pandu endued<br>with excess of energy had become so mighty, king Dhritarashtra became<br>very miserable with anxiety. Then summoning unto his side Kanika, that<br>foremost of minister, well-versed in the science of politics and an<br>expert in counsels the king said, 'O best of Brahmanas, the Pandavas are<br>daily overshadowing the earth. I am exceedingly jealous of them. Should I<br>have peace or war with them? O Kanika, advise me truly, for I shall do as<br>thou biddest.<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'That best of Brahmanas, thus addressed by the<br>king, freely answered him in these pointed words well-agreeing with the<br>import of political science."<br><br>"Listen to me, O sinless king, as I answer thee. And, O best of Kuru<br>kings, it behoveth thee not to be angry with me after hearing all I say.<br>Kings should ever be ready with uplifted maces (to strike when<br>necessary), and they should ever increase their prowess. Carefully<br>avoiding all faults themselves they should ceaselessly watch over the<br>faults of their foes and take advantage of them. If the king is always<br>ready to strike, everybody feareth him. Therefore the king should ever<br>have recourse to chastisement in all he doeth. He should so conduct<br>himself that, his foe may not detect any weak side in him. But by means<br>of the weakness he detecteth in his foe he should pursue him (to<br>destruction). He should always conceal, like the tortoise concealing its<br>body, his means and ends, and he should always keep back his own weakness<br>from, the sight of others. And having begun a particular act, he should<br>ever accomplish it thoroughly. Behold, a thorn, if not extracted wholly,<br>produceth a festering sore. The slaughter of a foe who doeth thee evil is<br>always praiseworthy. If the foe be one of great prowess, one should<br>always watch for the hour of his disaster and then kill him without any<br>scruples. If he should happen to be a great warrior, his hour of disaster<br>also should be watched and he should then be induced to fly. O sire, an<br>enemy should never be scorned, however contemptible. A spark of fire is<br>capable of consuming an extensive forest if only it can spread from one<br>object to another in proximity. Kings should sometimes feign blindness<br>and deafness, for if impotent to chastise, they should pretend not to<br>notice the faults that call for chastisement. On occasions, such as<br>these, let them regard their bows as made of straw. But they should be<br>always on the alert like a herd of deer sleeping in the woods. When thy<br>foe is in thy power, destroy him by every means open or secret. Do not<br>show him any mercy, although he seeketh thy protection. A foe, or one<br>that hath once injured thee, should be destroyed by lavishing money, if<br>necessary, for by killing him thou mayest be at thy ease. The dead can<br>never inspire fear. Thou must destroy the three, five and seven<br>(resources) of thy foes. Thou must destroy thy foes root and branch. Then<br>shouldst thou destroy their allies and partisans. The allies and<br>partisans can never exist if the principal be destroyed. If the root of<br>the tree is torn up, the branches and twigs can never exist as before.<br>Carefully concealing thy own means and ends, thou shouldst always watch<br>thy foes, always seeking their flaws. Thou shouldst, O king, rule thy<br>kingdom, always anxiously watching thy foes. By maintaining the perpetual<br>fire by sacrifices, by brown cloths, by matted locks, and by hides of<br>animals for thy bedding, shouldst thou at first gain the confidence of<br>thy foes, and when thou has gained it thou shouldst then spring upon them<br>like a wolf. For it hath been said that in the acquisition of wealth even<br>the garb of holiness might be employed as a hooked staff to bend down a<br>branch in order to pluck the fruits that are ripe. The method followed in<br>the plucking of fruits should be the method in destroying foes, for thou<br>shouldst proceed on the principle of selection. Bear thy foe upon thy<br>shoulders till the time cometh when thou canst throw him down, breaking<br>him into pieces like an earthen pot thrown down with violence upon a<br>stony surface. The foe must never be let off even though he addresseth<br>thee most piteously. No pity shouldst thou show him but slay him at once.<br>By the arts of conciliation or the expenditure of money should the foe be<br>slain. By creating disunion amongst his allies, or by the employment of<br>force, indeed by every means in thy power shouldst thou destroy thy foe.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Tell me truly how a foe can be destroyed by the<br>arts of conciliation or the expenditure of money, or by producing<br>disunion or by the employment of force.'<br><br>"Kanika replied, 'Listen, O monarch, to the history of a jackal dwelling<br>in days of yore in the forest and fully acquainted with the science of<br>politics. There was a wise jackal, mindful of his own interests who lived<br>in the company of four friends, viz., a tiger, a mouse, a wolf, and a<br>mongoose. One day they saw in the woods a strong deer, the leader of a<br>herd, whom, however, they could not seize for his fleetness and strength.<br>They thereupon called a council for consultation. The jackal opening the<br>proceedings said, 'O tiger, thou hast made many an effort to seize this<br>deer, but all in vain simply because this deer is young, fleet and very<br>intelligent. Let now the mouse go and eat into its feet when it lieth<br>asleep. And when this is done, let the tiger approach and seize it. Then<br>shall we all, with great pleasure feast on it.' Hearing these words of<br>the jackal, they all set to work very cautiously as he directed. And the<br>mouse ate into the feet of the deer and the tiger killed it as<br>anticipated. And beholding the body of the deer lying motionless on the<br>ground, the jackal said unto his companions, 'Blessed be ye! Go and<br>perform your ablutions. In the meantime I will look after the deer.'<br>Hearing what the jackal said, they all went into a stream. And the jackal<br>waited there, deeply meditating upon what he should do. The tiger endued<br>with great strength, returned first of all to the spot after having<br>performed his ablutions. And he saw the jackal there plunged in<br>meditation. The tiger said, 'Why art thou so sorrowful, O wise one! Thou<br>art the foremost of all intelligent beings. Let us enjoy ourselves today<br>by feasting on this carcass.' The jackal said, 'Hear, O mighty-armed one,<br>what the mouse hath said. He hath even said, O, fie on the strength of<br>the king of the beasts! This deer hath been slain by me. By might of my<br>arm he will today gratify his hunger.' When he hath boasted in such a<br>language, I, for my part, do not wish to touch this food.' The tiger<br>replied, 'If, indeed, the mouse hath said so, my sense is now awakened. I<br>shall, from this day, slay with the might of my own arms, creatures<br>ranging the forest and then feast on their flesh.' Having said this, the<br>tiger went away.<br><br>"And after the tiger had left the spot, the mouse came. And seeing the<br>mouse come, the jackal addressed him and said, 'Blest be thou, O mouse,<br>but listen to what the mongoose hath said. He hath even said, The carcass<br>of this deer is poison (the tiger having touched it with his claws). I<br>will not eat of it. On the other hand, if thou, O jackal, permittest it,<br>I will even slay the mouse and feast on him.' Hearing this the mouse<br>became alarmed and quickly entered his hole. And after the mouse had<br>gone, the wolf, O king, came there having performed his ablutions. And<br>seeing the wolf come, the jackal said unto him, 'The king of the beasts<br>hath been angry with thee. Evil is certain to overtake thee. He is<br>expected here with his wife. Do as thou pleasest.' Thus was the wolf<br>also, fond of animal flesh, got rid of by the jackal. And the wolf fled,<br>contracting his body into the smallest dimensions. It was then that the<br>mongoose came. And, O king, the jackal, seeing him come, said, 'By the<br>might of my arm have I defeated the others who have already fled. Fight<br>with me first and then eat of this flesh as you please.' The mongoose<br>replied, 'When, indeed, the tiger, the wolf, and the intelligent mouse<br>have all been defeated by thee, heroes as they are, thou seemest to be a<br>greater hero still. I do not desire to fight with thee.' Saying this, the<br>mongoose also went away.<br><br>"Kanika continued, 'When they all had thus left the place, the jackal,<br>well-pleased with the success of his policy, alone ate up that flesh. If<br>kings always act in this way, they can be happy. Thus should the timid by<br>exciting their fears, the courageous by the arts of conciliation, the<br>covetous by gift of wealth, and equals and inferiors by exhibition of<br>prowess be brought under thy sway. Besides all this, O king, that I have<br>said, listen now to something else that I say.'<br><br>"Kanika continued, 'If thy son, friend, brother, father, or even the<br>spiritual preceptor, anyone becometh thy foe, thou shouldst, if desirous<br>of prosperity, slay him without scruples. By curses and incantations, by<br>gift of wealth, by poison, or by deception, the foe should be slain. He<br>should never be neglected from disdain. If both the parties be equal and<br>success uncertain, then he that acteth with diligence groweth in<br>prosperity. If the spiritual preceptor himself be vain, ignorant of what<br>should be done and what left undone, and vicious in his ways, even he<br>should be chastised. If thou art angry, show thyself as if thou art not<br>so, speaking even then with a smile on thy lips. Never reprove any one<br>with indications of anger (in thy speech). And O Bharata, speak soft<br>words before thou smitest and even while thou art smiting! After the<br>smiting is over, pity the victim, and grieve for him, and even shed<br>tears. Comforting thy foe by conciliation, by gift of wealth, and smooth<br>behaviour, thou must smite him when he walketh not aright. Thou shouldst<br>equally smile the heinous offender who liveth by the practice of virtue,<br>for the garb of virtue simply covereth his offences like black clouds<br>covering the mountains. Thou shouldst burn the house of that person whom<br>thou punishest with death. And thou shouldst never permit beggars and<br>atheists and thieves to dwell in thy kingdom. By a sudden sally or<br>pitched battle by poison or by corrupting his allies, by gift of wealth,<br>by any means in thy power, thou shouldst destroy thy foe. Thou mayest act<br>with the greatest cruelty. Thou shouldst make thy teeth sharp to give a<br>fatal bite. And thou should ever smite so effectually that thy foe may<br>not again raise his head. Thou shouldst ever stand in fear of even one<br>from whom there is no fear, not to speak of him from whom there is such.<br>For if the first be ever powerful he may destroy thee to the root (for<br>thy unpreparedness). Thou shouldst never trust the faithless, nor trust<br>too much those that are faithful, for if those in whom thou confidest<br>prove thy foes, thou art certain to be annihilated. After testing their<br>faithfulness thou shouldst employ spies in thy own kingdom and in the<br>kingdoms of others. Thy spies in foreign kingdoms should be apt deceivers<br>and persons in the garb of ascetics. Thy spies should be placed in<br>gardens, places of amusement, temples and other holy places, drinking<br>halls, streets, and with the (eighteen) tirthas (viz., the minister, the<br>chief priest, the heir-presumptive, the commander-in-chief, the<br>gate-keepers of the court, persons in the inner apartments, the jailor,<br>the chief surveyor, the head of the treasury, the general executant of<br>orders, the chief of the town police, the chief architect, the chief<br>justice, the president of the council, the chief of the punitive<br>department, the commander of the fort, the chief of the arsenal, the<br>chief of the frontier guards, and the keeper of the forests), and in<br>places of sacrifice, near wells, on mountains and in rivers, in forests,<br>and in all places where people congregate. In speech thou shouldst ever<br>be humble, but let thy heart be ever sharp as razor. And when thou art<br>engaged in doing even a very cruel and terrible act, thou shouldst talk<br>with smiles on thy lips. If desirous of prosperity, thou shouldst adopt<br>all arts&#8212;humility, oath, conciliation. Worshipping the feet of others by<br>lowering thy head, inspiring hope, and the like. And, a person conversant<br>with the rules of policy is like a tree decked with flowers but bearing<br>no fruit; or, if bearing fruit, these must be at a great height not<br>easily attainable from the ground; and if any of these fruits seem to be<br>ripe care must be taken to make it appear raw. Conducting himself in such<br>a way, he shall never fade. Virtue, wealth and pleasure have both their<br>evil and good effects closely knit together. While extracting the effects<br>that are good, those that are evil should be avoided. Those that practise<br>virtue (incessantly) are made unhappy for want of wealth and the neglect<br>of pleasure. Those again in pursuit of wealth are made unhappy for the<br>neglect of two others. And so those who pursue pleasure suffer for their<br>inattention to virtue and wealth. Therefore, thou shouldst pursue virtue,<br>wealth and pleasure, in such a way that thou mayest not have to suffer<br>therefrom. With humiliation and attention, without jealousy and<br>solicitous of accomplishing thy purpose, shouldst thou, in all sincerity,<br>consult with the Brahmanas. When thou art fallen, thou shouldst raise<br>thyself by any means, gentle or violent; and after thou hast thus raised<br>thyself thou shouldst practise virtue. He that hath never been afflicted<br>with calamity can never have prosperity. This may be seen in the life of<br>one who surviveth his calamities. He that is afflicted with sorrow should<br>be consoled by the recitation of the history of persons of former times<br>(like those of Nala and Rama). He whose heart hath been unstrung by<br>sorrow should be consoled with hopes of future prosperity. He again who<br>is learned and wise should be consoled by pleasing offices presently<br>rendered unto him. He who, having concluded a treaty with an enemy,<br>reposeth at ease as if he hath nothing more to do, is very like a person<br>who awaketh, fallen down from the top of a tree whereon he had slept. A<br>king should ever keep to himself his counsels without fear of calumny,<br>and while beholding everything with the eyes of his spies, he should take<br>care to conceal his own emotions before the spies of his enemies. Like a<br>fisherman who becometh prosperous by catching and killing fish, a king<br>can never grow prosperous without tearing the vitals of his enemy and<br>without doing some violent deeds. The might of thy foe, as represented by<br>his armed force, should ever be completely destroyed, by ploughing it up<br>(like weeds) and mowing it down and otherwise afflicting it by disease,<br>starvation, and want of drink. A person in want never approacheth (from<br>love) one in affluence; and when one's purpose hath been accomplished,<br>one hath no need to approach him whom he had hitherto looked to for its<br>accomplishment. Therefore, when thou doest anything never do it<br>completely, but ever leave something to be desired for by others (whose<br>services thou mayest need). One who is desirous of prosperity should with<br>diligence seek allies and means, and carefully conduct his wars. His<br>exertions in these respects should always be guided by prudence. A<br>prudent king should ever act in such a way that friends and foes may<br>never know his motive before the commencement of his acts. Let them know<br>all when the act hath been commenced or ended, and as long as danger doth<br>not come, so long only shall thou act as if thou art afraid. But when it<br>hath overtaken thee, thou must grapple with it courageously. He who<br>trusteth in a foe who hath been brought under subjection by force,<br>summoneth his own death as a crab by her act of conception. Thou shouldst<br>always reckon the future act as already arrived (and concert measures for<br>meeting it), else, from want of calmness caused by haste, thou mayest<br>overlook an important point in meeting it when it is before thee. A<br>person desirous of prosperity should always exert with prudence, adopting<br>his measures to time and place. He should also act with an eye to destiny<br>as capable of being regulated by mantras and sacrificial rites; and to<br>virtue, wealth, and pleasure. It is well-known that time and place (if<br>taken into consideration) always produce the greatest good. If the foe is<br>insignificant, he should not yet be despised, for he may soon grow like a<br>palmyra tree extending its roots or like a spark of fire in the deep<br>woods that may soon burst into an extensive conflagration. As a little<br>fire gradually fed with faggots soon becometh capable of consuming even<br>the biggest blocks, so the person who increaseth his power by making<br>alliances and friendships soon becometh capable of subjugating even the<br>most formidable foe. The hope thou givest unto thy foe should be long<br>deferred before it is fulfilled; and when the time cometh for its<br>fulfilment, invent some pretext for deferring it still. Let that pretext<br>be shown as founded upon some reason, and let that reason itself be made<br>to appear as founded on some other reason. Kings should, in the matter of<br>destroying their foes, ever resemble razors in every particular;<br>unpitying as these are sharp, hiding their intents as these are concealed<br>in their leathern cases, striking when the opportunity cometh as these<br>are used on proper occasions, sweeping off their foes with all their<br>allies and dependants as these shave the head or the chin without leaving<br>a single hair. O supporter of the dignity of the Kurus, bearing thyself<br>towards the Pandavas and others also as policy dictateth, act in such a<br>way that thou mayest not have to grieve in future. Well do I know that<br>thou art endued with every blessing, and possessed of every mark of good<br>fortune. Therefore, O king, protect thyself from the sons of Pandu! O<br>king, the sons of Pandu are stronger than their cousins (thy sons);<br>therefore, O chastiser of foes, I tell thee plainly what thou shouldst<br>do. Listen to it, O king, with thy children, and having listened to it,<br>exert yourselves (to do the needful). O king, act in such a way that<br>there may not be any fear for thee from the Pandavas. Indeed, adopt such<br>measures consonant with the science of policy that thou mayest not have<br>to grieve in the future.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having delivered himself thus Kanika returned<br>to his abode, while the Kuru king Dhritarashtra became pensive and<br>melancholy.'"
