                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'While that king of kings dwelt in heaven&#8212;the home<br>of the celestials, he was reverenced by the gods, the Sadhyas, the<br>Maruts, and the Vasus. Of sacred deeds, and mind under complete control,<br>the monarch used to repair now and then from the abode of the celestials<br>unto the region of Brahman. And it hath been heard by me that he dwelt<br>for a long time in heaven.<br><br>"One day that best of kings, Yayati, went to Indra and there in course of<br>conversation the lord of Earth was asked by Indra as follows:<br><br>'What didst thou say, O king, when thy son Puru took thy decrepitude on<br>Earth and when thou gavest him thy kingdom?'<br><br>"Yayati answered, 'I told him that the whole country between the rivers<br>Ganga and Yamuna was his. That is, indeed, the central region of the<br>Earth, while the out-lying regions are to be the dominions of thy<br>brothers. I also told him that those without anger were ever superior to<br>those under its sway, those disposed to forgive were ever superior to the<br>unforgiving. Man is superior to the lower animals. Among men again the<br>learned are superior to the un-learned. If wronged, thou shouldst not<br>wrong in return. One's wrath, if disregarded, burneth one's own self; but<br>he that regardeth it not taketh away all the virtues of him that<br>exhibiteh it. Never shouldst thou pain others by cruel speeches. Never<br>subdue thy foes by despicable means; and never utter such scorching and<br>sinful words as may torture others. He that pricketh as if with thorns<br>men by means of hard and cruel words, thou must know, ever carrieth in<br>his mouth the Rakshasas. Prosperity and luck fly away at his very sight.<br>Thou shouldst ever keep the virtuous before thee as thy models; thou<br>shouldst ever with retrospective eye compare thy acts with those of the<br>virtuous; thou shouldst ever disregard the hard words of the wicked. Thou<br>shouldst ever make the conduct of the wise the model upon which thou art<br>to act thyself. The man hurt by the arrows of cruel speech hurled from<br>one's lips, weepeth day and night. Indeed, these strike at the core of<br>the body. Therefore the wise never fling these arrows at others. There is<br>nothing in the three worlds by which thou canst worship and adore the<br>deities better than by kindness, friendship, charity and sweet speeches<br>unto all. Therefore, shouldst thou always utter words that soothe, and<br>not those that scorch. And thou shouldst regard those that deserve, thy<br>regards, and shouldst always give but never beg!"'
