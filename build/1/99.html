                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Santanu asked, 'What was the fault of the Vasus and who was Apava,<br>through whose curse the Vasus had to be born among men? What also hath<br>this child of thine, Gangadatta, done for which he shall have to live<br>among men? Why also were the Vasus, the lords of the three worlds,<br>condemned to be born amongst men? O daughter of Jahnu, tell me all.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, the celestial daughter of<br>Jahnu, Ganga, then replied unto the monarch, her husband, that bull<br>amongst men, saying, 'O best of Bharata's race, he who was obtained as<br>son by Varuna was called Vasishtha, the Muni who afterwards came to be<br>known as Apava. He had his asylum on the breast of the king of mountains<br>called Meru. The spot was sacred and abounded with birds and beasts. And<br>there bloomed at all times of the year flowers of every season. And, O<br>best of Bharata's race, that foremost of virtuous men, the son of Varuna,<br>practised his ascetic penances in those woods abounding with sweet roots<br>and water.<br><br>"Daksha had a daughter known by the name of Surabhi, who, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, for benefiting the world, brought forth, by her<br>connection with Kasyapa, a daughter (Nandini) in the form of a cow. That<br>foremost of all kine, Nandini, was the cow of plenty (capable of granting<br>every desire). The virtuous son of Varuna obtained Nandini for his Homa<br>rites. And Nandini, dwelling in that hermitage which was adored by Munis,<br>roamed about fearlessly in those sacred and delightful woods.<br><br>"One day, O bull of Bharata's race, there came into those woods adored by<br>the gods and celestial Rishis, the Vasus with Prithu at their head. And<br>wandering there with their wives, they enjoyed themselves in those<br>delightful woods and mountains. And as they wandered there, the<br>slender-waisted wife of one of the Vasus, O thou of the prowess of Indra,<br>saw in those woods Nandini, the cow of plenty. And seeing that cow<br>possessing the wealth of all accomplishments, large eyes, full udders,<br>fine tail, beautiful hoofs, and every other auspicious sign, and yielding<br>much milk, she showed the animal to her husband Dyu. O thou of the<br>prowess of the first of elephants, when Dyu was shown that cow, he began<br>to admire her several qualities and addressing his wife, said, 'O<br>black-eyed girl of fair thighs, this excellent cow belongeth to that<br>Rishi whose is this delightful asylum. O slender-waisted one, that mortal<br>who drinketh the sweet milk of this cow remaineth in unchanged youth for<br>ten thousand years.' O best of monarchs, hearing this, the<br>slender-waisted goddess of faultless features then addressed her lord of<br>blazing splendour and said, 'There is on earth a friend of mine, Jitavati<br>by name, possessed of great beauty and youth. She is the daughter of that<br>god among men, the royal sage Usinara, endued with intelligence and<br>devoted to truth. I desire to have this cow, O illustrious one, with her<br>calf for that friend of mine. Therefore, O best of celestials, bring that<br>cow so that my friend drinking of her milk may alone become on earth free<br>from disease and decrepitude. O illustrious and blameless one, it<br>behoveth thee to grant me this desire of mine. There is nothing that<br>would be more agreeable to me.' On hearing these words of his wife, Dyu,<br>moved by the desire of humouring her, stole that cow, aided by his<br>brothers Prithu and the others. Indeed, Dyu, commanded by his lotus-eyed<br>wife, did her bidding, forgetting at the moment the high ascetic merits<br>of the Rishi who owned her. He did not think at the time that he was<br>going to fall by committing the sin of stealing the cow.<br><br>"When the son of Varuna returned to his asylum in the evening with fruits<br>he had collected, he beheld not the cow with her calf there. He began to<br>search for them in the woods, but when the great ascetic of superior<br>intelligence found not his cow on search, he saw by his ascetic vision<br>that she had been stolen by the Vasus. His wrath was instantly kindled<br>and he cursed the Vasus, saying, 'Because the Vasus have stolen my cow of<br>sweet milk and handsome tail, therefore, shall they certainly be born on<br>earth!'<br><br>"O thou bull of Bharata's race, the illustrious Rishi Apava thus cursed<br>the Vasus in wrath. And having cursed them, the illustrious one set his<br>heart once more on ascetic meditation. And after that Brahmarshi of great<br>power and ascetic wealth had thus in wrath cursed the Vasus, the latter,<br>O king, coming to know of it, speedily came into his asylum. And<br>addressing the Rishi, O bull among kings, they endeavoured to pacify him.<br>But they failed, O tiger among men, to obtain grace from Apava&#8212;that<br>Rishi conversant, with all rules of virtue. The virtuous Apava, however,<br>said, 'Ye Vasus, with Dhava and others, ye have been cursed by me. But ye<br>shall be freed from my curse within a year of your birth among men. But<br>he for whose deed ye have been cursed by me he, viz., Dyu, shall for his<br>sinful act, have to dwell on earth for a length of time. I shall not make<br>futile the words I have uttered in wrath. Dyu, though dwelling on Earth,<br>shall not beget children. He shall, however, be virtuous and conversant<br>with the scriptures. He shall be an obedient son to his father, but he<br>shall have to abstain from the pleasure of female companionship.'<br><br>"Thus addressing the Vasus, the great Rishi went away. The Vasus then<br>together came to me. And, O king, the begged of me the boon that as soon<br>as they would be born, I should throw them into the water. And, O best of<br>kings, I did as they desired, in order to free them from their earthly<br>life. And O best of kings, from the Rishi's curse, this one only, viz.,<br>Dyu, himself, is to live on earth for some time.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said this, the goddess disappeared then<br>and there. And taking with her the child, she went away to the region she<br>chose. And that child of Santanu was named both Gangeya and Devavrata and<br>excelled his father in all accomplishments.<br><br>"Santanu, after the disappearance of his wife, returned to his capital<br>with a sorrowful heart. I shall now recount to thee the many virtues and<br>the great good fortune of the illustrious king Santanu of the Bharata<br>race. Indeed, it is this splendid history that is called the<br>Mahabharata.'"
