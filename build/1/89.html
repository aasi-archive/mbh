                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Yayati said, 'I am Yayati, the son of Nahusha and the father of Puru.<br>Cast off from the region of the celestials and of Siddhas and Rishis for<br>having disregarded every creature, I am falling down, my righteousness<br>having sustained diminution. In years I am older than you; therefore, I<br>have not saluted you first. Indeed, the Brahmanas always reverence him<br>who is older in years or superior in learning or in ascetic merit.'<br><br>"Ashtaka then replied, 'Thou sayest, O monarch, that he who is older in<br>years is worthy of regard. But it is said that he is truly worthy of<br>worship who is superior in learning and ascetic merit.'<br><br>"Yayati replied to this, 'It is said that sin destroyeth the merits of<br>four virtuous acts. Vanity containeth the element of that which leadeth<br>to hell. The virtuous never follow in the footsteps of the vicious. They<br>act in such a way that their religious merit always increaseth. I myself<br>had great religious merit, but all that, however, is gone. I will<br>scarcely be able to regain it even by my best exertions. Beholding my<br>fate, he that is bent upon (achieving) his own good, will certainly<br>suppress vanity. He who having acquired great wealth performeth<br>meritorious sacrifices, who having acquired all kinds of learning<br>remaineth humble, and who having studied the entire Vedas devoteth<br>himself to asceticism with a heart withdrawn from all mundane enjoyments,<br>goeth to heaven. None should exult in having acquired great wealth. None<br>should be vain of having studied the entire Vedas. In the world men are<br>of different dispositions. Destiny is supreme. Both power and exertion<br>are all fruitless. Knowing Destiny to be all-powerful, the wise, whatever<br>their portions may be, should neither exult nor grieve. When creatures<br>know that their weal and woe are dependent on Destiny and not on their<br>own exertion or power, they should neither grieve nor exult, remembering<br>that Destiny is all powerful. The wise should ever live contented,<br>neither grieving at woe nor exulting at weal. When Destiny is supreme,<br>both grief and exultation are unbecoming. O Ashtaka, I never suffer<br>myself to be overcome by fear, nor do I ever entertain grief, knowing for<br>certain that I shall be in the world what the great disposer of all hath<br>ordained. Insects and worms, all oviparous creatures, vegetable<br>existences, all crawling animals, vermin, the fish in the water, stones,<br>grass, wood&#8212;in fact, all created things, when they are freed from the<br>effects of their acts, are united with the Supreme Soul. Happiness and<br>misery are both transient. Therefore, O Ashtaka, why should I grieve? We<br>can never know how we are to act in order to avoid misery. Therefore,<br>none should grieve for misery.'<br><br>"Possessed of every virtue, king Yayati who was the maternal grandfather<br>of Ashtaka, while staying in the welkin, at the conclusion of his speech,<br>was again questioned by Ashtaka. The latter said, 'O king of kings, tell<br>me, in detail, of all those regions that thou hast visited and enjoyed,<br>as well as the period for which thou hast enjoyed each. Thou speakest of<br>the precepts of religion even like the clever masters acquainted with the<br>acts and sayings of great beings!' Yayati replied, 'I was a great king on<br>Earth, owning the whole world for my dominion. Leaving it, I acquired by<br>dint of religious merit many high regions. There I dwelt for a full<br>thousand years, and then I attained to a very high region the abode of<br>Indra, of extraordinary beauty having a thousand gates, and extending<br>over a hundred yojanas all round. There too, I dwelt a full thousand<br>years and then attained to a higher region still. That is the region of<br>perfect beatitude, where decay never exists, the region, viz., that of<br>the Creator and the Lord of Earth, so difficult of attainment. There also<br>I dwelt for a full thousand years, and then attained to another very high<br>region viz., that of the god of gods (Vishnu) where, too, I had lived in<br>happiness. Indeed, I dwelt in various regions, adored by all the<br>celestials, and possessed of prowess and splendour equal unto those of<br>the celestials themselves. Capable of assuming any form at will, I lived<br>for a million years in the gardens of Nandana sporting with the Apsaras<br>and beholding numberless beautiful trees clad in flowery vesture and<br>sending forth delicious perfume all round. And after many, many years had<br>elapsed, while still residing there in enjoyment of perfect beatitude,<br>the celestial messenger of grim visage, one day, in a loud and deep<br>voice, thrice shouted to me&#8212;Ruined! Ruined! Ruined!&#8212;O lion among kings,<br>this much do I remember. I was then fallen from Nandana, my religious<br>merits gone! I heard in the skies, O king, the voices of the celestials<br>exclaiming in grief,&#8212;Alas! What a misfortune! Yayati, with his religious<br>merits destroyed, though virtuous and of sacred deeds, is falling!&#8212;And<br>as I was falling, I asked them loudly, 'Where, ye celestials, are those<br>wise ones amongst whom I am to fall?' They pointed out to me this sacred<br>sacrificial region belonging to you. Beholding the curls of smoke<br>blackening the atmosphere and smelling the perfume of clarified butter<br>poured incessantly upon fire, and guided thereby, I am approaching this<br>region of yours, glad at heart that I come amongst you.'"
