                            (Chaitraratha Parva continued)<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'At that region where the Ganga entered the plains<br>there lived a great Rishi, devoted to the austerest of penances. Of rigid<br>vows and great wisdom, he bore the name Bharadwaja. One day, on coming to<br>the Ganga to perform his ablutions, the Rishi saw the Apsara Ghritachi,<br>who had come before, standing on the bank after her ablutions were over.<br>And it so happened that a wind arose and disrobed the Apsara standing<br>there. And the Rishi beholding her thus disrobed, felt the influence of<br>desire. Though practising the vow of continence from his very youth, as<br>soon as he felt the influence of desire, the Rishi's vital fluid came<br>out. And as it came out, he held it in a pot (drana), and of that fluid<br>thus preserved in a pot was born a son who came to be called Drona (the<br>pot-born). And Drona studied all the Vedas and their several branches.<br>And Bharadwaja had a friend named Prishata who was the king of Panchalas.<br>And about the time that Drona was born, Prishata also obtained a son<br>named Drupada. And that bull amongst Kshatriyas, Prishata's son, going<br>every day to that asylum of Bharadwaja, played and studied with Drona.<br>And after Prishata's death, Drupada succeeded him on the throne. Drona<br>about this time heard that (the great Brahmana hero) Rama (on the eve of<br>his retiring into the weeds) was resolved to give away all his wealth.<br>Hearing this, the son of Bharadwaja repaired unto Rama who was about to<br>retire into the woods and addressing him, said, 'O best of Brahmanas,<br>know me to be Drona who hath come to thee to obtain thy wealth.' Rama<br>replied, saying, 'I have given away everything. All that I now have is<br>this body of mine and my weapons. O Brahmana, thou mayest ask of me one<br>of these two, either my body or my weapons.' Then Drona said, 'It<br>behoveth thee, sir, to give me all thy weapons together with (the<br>mysteries of) their use and withdrawal.'<br><br>"The Brahmana continued, 'Then Rama of Bhrigu's race, saying, 'So be it,'<br>gave all his weapons unto Drona, who obtaining them regarded himself as<br>crowned with success. Drona obtaining from Rama the most exalted of all<br>weapons, called the Brahma weapon, became exceedingly glad and acquired a<br>decided superiority over all men. Then the son of Bharadwaja, endued with<br>great prowess went to king Drupada, and approaching that monarch, that<br>tiger among men, said, 'Know me for thy friend.' Hearing this Drupada<br>said, 'One of low birth can never be the friend of one whose lineage is<br>pure, nor can one who is not a car-warrior have a car-warrior for his<br>friend. So also one who is not a king cannot have a king as his friend.<br>Why dost thou, therefore, desire (to revive our) former friendship?'<br><br>"The Brahmana continued, 'Drona, gifted with great intelligence, was<br>extremely mortified at this, and settling in his mind some means of<br>humiliating the king of the Panchala he went to the capital of the Kurus,<br>called after the name of an elephant. Then Bhishma, taking with him his<br>grandsons, presented them unto the wise son of Bharadwaja as his pupils<br>for instruction, along with various kinds of wealth. Then Drona, desirous<br>of humiliating king Drupada, called together his disciples and addressed<br>them, 'Ye sinless ones, it behoveth you, after you have been accomplished<br>in arms, to give me as preceptorial fee something that I cherish in my<br>heart.' Then Arjuna and others said unto their preceptor, 'So be<br>it.'&#8212;After a time when the Pandavas became skilled in arms and sure<br>aims, demanding of them his fee, he again told them these words,<br>'Drupada, the son of Prishata, is the king of Chhatravati. Take away from<br>him his kingdom, and give it unto me.' Then the Pandavas, defeating<br>Drupada in battle and taking him prisoner along with his ministers,<br>offered him unto Drona, who beholding the vanquished monarch, said, 'O<br>king, I again solicit thy friendship; and because none who is not a king<br>deserveth to be the friend of a king, therefore, O Yajnasena, I am<br>resolved to divide thy kingdom amongst ourselves. While thou art the king<br>of the country to the south of Bhagirathi (Ganga), I will rule the<br>country to the north.'<br><br>"The Brahmana continued, 'The king of the Panchalas, thus addressed by<br>the wise son of Bharadwaja, told that best of Brahmanas and foremost of<br>all persons conversant with weapons, these words, 'O high-souled son of<br>Bharadwaja, blest be thou, let it be so, let there be eternal friendship<br>between us as thou desirest!' Thus addressing each other and establishing<br>a permanent bond between themselves, Drona and the king of Panchala, both<br>of them chastisers of foes, went away to the places they came from. But<br>the thought of that humiliation did not leave the king's mind for a<br>single moment. Sad at heart, the king began to waste away.'"
