                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Hear now, as I recite the recorded genealogy, that<br>is sacred and subservient to religion, profit and pleasure, of these<br>royal sages&#8212;Daksha, the lord of creation, Manu, the son of Surya,<br>Bharata, Ruru, Puru, and Ajamidha. I shall also recite to thee, O sinless<br>one, the genealogies of the Yadavas and of the Kurus and of the king of<br>the Bharata line. These genealogies are sacred and their recitation is a<br>great act of propitiation. That recitation conferreth wealth, fame and<br>long life. And, O sinless one, all these I have named shone in their<br>splendour and were equal unto the great Rishis in energy.<br><br>"Prachetas had ten sons who were all devoted to asceticism and possessed<br>of every virtue. They burnt, of old, by the fire emanating from their<br>mouths, several plants of poisonous and innumerable large trees that had<br>covered the Earth and became a source of great discomfort to man. After<br>these ten, was born another named Daksha. It is from Daksha that all<br>creatures have sprung. Therefore is he, O tiger among men, called the<br>Grandfather. Born of Prachetas the Muni Daksha, uniting himself with<br>Virini, begat a thousand sons of rigid vows, all like himself. And Narada<br>taught these thousand sons of Daksha the excellent philosophy of Sankhya<br>as a means of salvation. And, O Janamejaya, the lord of creation, Daksha,<br>then, from the desire of making creatures, begat fifty daughters. And he<br>made all of them his appointed daughters (so that their sons might be his<br>sons also for the performance of all religious acts). And he bestowed ten<br>of his daughters on Dharma, and thirteen on Kasyapa. And he gave<br>twenty-seven to Chandra, who are all engaged in indicating time. And<br>Kasyapa, the son of Marichi, begat on the eldest of his thirteen wives,<br>the Adityas, the celestials endued with great energy and having Indra as<br>their head and also Vivaswat (the Sun). And of Vivaswat was born the lord<br>Yama. And Martanda (Vivaswat) also begat another son after Yama, gifted<br>with great intelligence and named Manu. And Manu was endued with great<br>wisdom and devoted to virtue. And he became the progenitor of a line. And<br>in Manu's race have been born all human beings, who have, therefore, been<br>called Manavas. And it is of Manu that all men including Brahmanas,<br>Kshatriyas, and others have been descended, and are, therefore, all<br>called Manavas. Subsequently, O monarch, the Brahmanas became united with<br>the Kshatriyas. And those sons of Manu that were Brahmanas devoted<br>themselves to the study of the Vedas. And Manu begat ten other children<br>named Vena, Dhrishnu, Narishyan, Nabhaga, Ikshvaku, Karusha, Saryati, the<br>eighth, a daughter named Ila, Prishadhru the ninth, and Nabhagarishta,<br>the tenth. They all betook themselves to the practices of Kshatriyas.<br>Besides these, Manu had fifty other sons on Earth. But we heard that they<br>all perished, quarrelling with one another. The learned Pururavas was<br>born of Ila. It hath been heard by us that Ila was both his mother and<br>father. And the great Pururavas had sway over thirteen islands of the<br>sea. And, though a human being, he was always surrounded by companions<br>that were superhuman. And Pururavas intoxicated with power quarrelled<br>with the Brahmanas and little caring for their anger robbed them of their<br>wealth. Beholding all this Sanatkumara came from the region of Brahman<br>and gave him good counsel, which was, however, rejected by Pururavas.<br>Then the wrath of the great Rishis was excited, and the avaricious<br>monarch, who intoxicated with power, had lost his reason, was immediately<br>destroyed by their curse.<br><br>"It was Pururavas who first brought from the region of the Gandharvas the<br>three kinds of fire (for sacrificial purpose). And he brought thence, the<br>Apsara Urvasi also. And the son of Ila begat upon Urvasi six sons who<br>were called Ayus, Dhimat, Amavasu and Dhridhayus, and Vanayus, and<br>Satayus. And it is said that Ayus begat four sons named Nahusha,<br>Vriddhasarman, Rajingaya, and Anenas, on the daughter of Swarbhanu. And,<br>O monarch, Nahusha, of all the sons of Ayus, being gifted with great<br>intelligence and prowess ruled his extensive kingdom virtuously. And king<br>Nahusha supported evenly the Pitris, the celestials, the Rishis, the<br>Brahmanas, the Gandharvas, the Nagas, the Rakshasas, the Kshatriyas, and<br>the Vaisyas. And he suppressed all robber-gangs with a mighty hand. But<br>he made the Rishis pay tribute and carry him on their backs like bests of<br>burden. And, conquering the very gods by the beauty of his person, his<br>asceticism, prowess, and energy, he ruled as if he were Indra himself.<br>And Nahusha begat six sons, all of sweet speech, named Yati, Yayati,<br>Sanyati, Ayati, and Dhruva. Yati betaking himself to asceticism became a<br>Muni like unto Brahman himself. Yayati became a monarch of great prowess<br>and virtue. He ruled the whole Earth, performed numerous sacrifices,<br>worshipped the Pitris with great reverence, and always respected the<br>gods. And he brought the whole world under his sway and was never<br>vanquished by any foe. And the sons of Yayati were all great bowmen and<br>resplendent with every virtue. And, O king, they were begotten upon (his<br>two wives) Devayani and Sarmishtha. And of Devayani were born Yadu and<br>Turvasu, and of Sarmishtha were born Drahyu, Anu, and Puru. And, O king,<br>having virtuously ruled his subjects for a long time, Yayati was attacked<br>with a hideous decrepitude destroying his personal beauty. And attacked<br>by decrepitude, the monarch then spoke, O Bharata, unto his sons Yadu and<br>Puru and Turvasu and Drahyu and Anu these words, 'Ye dear sons, I wish to<br>be a young man and to gratify my appetites in the company of young women.<br>Do you help me therein.' To him his eldest son born of Devayani then<br>said, 'What needest thou, O king? Dost thou want to have your youth?'<br>Yayati then told him, 'Accept thou my decrepitude, O son! With thy youth<br>I would enjoy myself. During the time of a great sacrifice I have been<br>cursed by the Muni Usanas (Sukra). O son, I would enjoy myself with your<br>youth. Take any of you this my decrepitude and with my body rule ye my<br>kingdom. I would enjoy myself with a renovated body. Therefore, ye my<br>sons, take ye my decrepitude.' But none of his sons accepted his<br>decrepitude. Then his youngest son Puru said unto him, 'O king, enjoy<br>thyself thou once again with a renovated body and returned youth! I shall<br>take thy decrepitude and at thy command rule thy kingdom.' Thus<br>addressed, the royal sage, by virtue of his ascetic power then<br>transferred his own decrepitude unto that high-souled son of his and with<br>the youth of Puru became a youth; while with the monarch's age Puru ruled<br>his kingdom.<br><br>"Then, after a thousand years had passed away, Yayati, that tiger among<br>kings, remained as strong and powerful as a tiger. And he enjoyed for a<br>long time the companionship of his two wives. And in the gardens of<br>Chitraratha (the king of Gandharvas), the king also enjoyed the company<br>of the Apsara Viswachi. But even after all this, the great king found his<br>appetites unsatiated. The king, then recollected the following truths<br>contained in the Puranas, 'Truly, one's appetites are never satiated by<br>enjoyment. On the other hand, like sacrificial butter poured into the<br>fire, they flame up with indulgence. Even if one enjoyed the whole Earth<br>with its wealth, diamonds and gold, animals and women, one may not yet be<br>satiated. It is only when man doth not commit any sin in respect of any<br>living thing, in thought, deed, or speech, it is then that he attaineth<br>to purity as that of Brahman. When one feareth nothing, when one is not<br>feared by anything, when one wisheth for nothing, when one injureth<br>nothing, it is then that one attaineth to the purity of Brahman.' The<br>wise monarch seeing this and satisfied that one's appetites are never<br>satiated, set his mind at rest by meditation, and took back from his son<br>his own decrepitude. And giving him back his youth, though his own<br>appetites were unsatiated, and installing him on the throne, he spoke<br>unto Puru thus, 'Thou art my true heir, thou art my true son by whom my<br>race is to be continued. In the world shall my race be known by thy name.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then that tiger among kings, having installed<br>his son Puru on the throne, went away to the mount of Bhrigu for devoting<br>himself to asceticism. And, having acquired great ascetic merit, after<br>long years, he succumbed to the inevitable influence of Time. He left his<br>human body by observing the vow of fasting, and ascended to heaven with<br>his wives.'"
