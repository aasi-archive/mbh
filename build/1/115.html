                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Meanwhile, O Janamejaya, Dhritarashtra begat upon<br>Gandhari a hundred sons, and upon a Vaisya wife another besides those<br>hundred. And Pandu had, by his two wives Kunti and Madri, five sons who<br>were great charioteers and who were all begotten by the celestials for<br>the perpetuation of the Kuru line.'<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'O best of Brahmanas, how did Gandhari bring forth<br>those hundred sons and in how many years? What were also the periods of<br>life allotted to each? How did Dhritarashtra also beget another son in a<br>Vaisya wife? How did Dhritarashtra behave towards his loving obedient,<br>and virtuous wife Gandhari? How were also begotten the five sons of<br>Pandu, those mighty charioteers, even though Pandu himself laboured under<br>the curse of the great Rishi (he slew)? Tell me all this in detail, for<br>my thirst for hearing everything relating to my own ancestor hath not<br>been slaked.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'One day Gandhari entertained with respectful<br>attention the great Dwaipayana who came to her abode, exhausted with<br>hunger and fatigue. Gratified with Gandhari's hospitality, the Rishi gave<br>her the boon she asked for, viz., that she should have a century of sons<br>each equal unto her lord in strength and accomplishments. Some time after<br>Gandhari conceived and she bore the burden in her womb for two long years<br>without being delivered. And she was greatly afflicted at this. It was<br>then that she heard that Kunti had brought forth a son whose splendour<br>was like unto the morning sun. Impatient of the period of gestation which<br>had prolonged so long, and deprived of reason by grief, she struck her<br>womb with great violence without the knowledge of her husband. And<br>thereupon came out of her womb, after two years' growth, a hard mass of<br>flesh like unto an iron ball. When she was about to throw it away,<br>Dwaipayana, learning everything by his spiritual powers, promptly came<br>there, and that first of ascetics beholding that ball of flesh, addressed<br>the daughter of Suvala thus, 'What hast thou done?' Gandhari, without<br>endeavouring to disguise her feelings, addressed the Rishi and said,<br>'Having heard that Kunti had brought forth a son like unto Surya in<br>splendour, I struck in grief at my womb. Thou hadst, O Rishi, granted me<br>the boon that I should have a hundred sons, but here is only a ball of<br>flesh for those hundred sons!' Vyasa then said, 'Daughter of Suvala, it<br>is even so. But my words can never be futile. I have not spoken an<br>untruth even in jest. I need not speak of other occasions. Let a hundred<br>pots full of clarified butter be brought instantly, and let them be<br>placed at a concealed spot. In the meantime, let cool water be sprinkled<br>over this ball of flesh.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'That ball of flesh then, sprinkled over with<br>water, became, in time, divided into a hundred and one parts, each about<br>the size of the thumb. These were then put into those pots full of<br>clarified butter that had been placed at a concealed spot and were<br>watched with care. The illustrious Vyasa then said unto the daughter of<br>Suvala that she should open the covers of the pots after full two years.<br>And having said this and made these arrangements, the wise Dwaipayana<br>went to the Himavat mountains for devoting himself to asceticism.<br><br>"Then in time, king Duryodhana was born from among those pieces of the<br>ball of flesh that had been deposited in those pots. According to the<br>order of birth, king Yudhishthira was the oldest. The news of<br>Duryodhana's birth was carried to Bhishma and the wise Vidura. The day<br>that the haughty Duryodhana was born was also the birth-day of Bhima of<br>mighty arms and great prowess.<br><br>"As soon as Duryodhana was born, he began to cry and bray like an ass.<br>And hearing that sound, the asses, vultures, jackals and crows uttered<br>their respective cries responsively. Violent winds began to blow, and<br>there were fires in various directions. Then king Dhritarashtra in great<br>fear, summoning Bhishma and Vidura and other well-wishers and all the<br>Kurus, and numberless Brahmanas, addressed them and said, 'The oldest of<br>those princes, Yudhishthira, is the perpetuator of our line. By virtue of<br>his birth he hath acquired the kingdom. We have nothing to say to this.<br>But shall this my son born after him become king? Tell me truly what is<br>lawful and right under these circumstances.' As soon as these words were<br>spoken, O Bharata, jackals and other carnivorous animals began to howl<br>ominously And marking those frightful omens all around, the assembled<br>Brahmanas and the wise Vidura replied, 'O king, O bull among men, when<br>these frightful omens are noticeable at the birth of thy eldest son, it<br>is evident that he shall be the exterminator of thy race. The prosperity<br>of all dependeth on his abandonment. Calamity there must be in keeping<br>him. O king, if thou abandonest him, there remain yet thy nine and ninety<br>sons. If thou desirest the good of thy race, abandon him, O Bharata! O<br>king, do good to the world and thy own race by casting off this one child<br>of thine. It hath been said that an individual should be cast off for the<br>sake of the family; that a family should be cast off for the sake of a<br>village; that a village may be abandoned for the sake of the whole<br>country; and that the earth itself may be abandoned for the sake of the<br>soul.' When Vidura and those Brahmanas had stated so, king Dhritarashtra<br>out of affection for his son had not the heart to follow that advice.<br>Then, O king, within a month, were born a full hundred sons unto<br>Dhritarashtra and a daughter also in excess of this hundred. And during<br>the time when Gandhari was in a state of advanced pregnancy, there was a<br>maid servant of the Vaisya class who used to attend on Dhritarashtra.<br>During that year, O king, was begotten upon her by the illustrious<br>Dhritarashtra a son endued with great intelligence who was afterwards<br>named Yuvutsu. And because he was begotten by a Kshatriya upon a Vaisya<br>woman, he came to be called Karna.<br><br>"Thus were born unto the wise Dhritarashtra a hundred sons who were all<br>heroes and mighty chariot-fighters, and a daughter over and above the<br>hundred, and another son Yuyutsu of great energy and prowess begotten<br>upon a Vaisya woman.'"
