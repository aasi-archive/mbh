                            (Khandava-daha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing those words of her sons Jarita continued,<br>'The little mouse that had come out of this hole was seized by a hawk<br>with his claws and carried away hence. Therefore, ye may fearlessly enter<br>this hole now.' The young ones replied, 'We are not by any means certain<br>of that mouse having been taken away by the hawk. There may be other mice<br>living here. From them we have every fear. Whereas it is doubtful whether<br>fire will at all approach us here. Already we see an adverse wind blowing<br>the flames away. If we enter the hole, death is certain at the hands of<br>the dwellers in the hole. But if we remain where we are, death is<br>uncertain. O mother, a position in which death is uncertain is better<br>than that in which it is certain. It is thy duty, therefore, to escape<br>thyself, for, if thou livest thou mayest obtain other children as good.'<br><br>"Their mother then said, 'Ye children, I myself saw the mighty hawk, that<br>best of birds, swoop down and fly away with the mouse from the hole. And<br>while he was flying away swiftly, I followed him behind and pronounced<br>blessing on him for his having taken away the mouse from the hole. I said<br>unto him. 'O king of hawks, because thou art flying away with our enemy,<br>the mouse, in thy claws, mayest thou, without a foe, live in heaven with<br>a golden body.' Afterwards when that hawk devoured the mouse, I came<br>away, obtaining his leave. Therefore, ye children, enter this hole<br>trustfully. Ye have nothing to fear. The mouse that was its inmate was<br>seized and taken away by the hawk in my sight.' The young ones again<br>said, 'O mother, we do not by any means know that the mouse hath been<br>carried away by the hawk. We cannot enter this hole in the ground without<br>being certain of the fact.' Their mother said, 'I know to a certainty<br>that the mouse hath been carried away by the hawk. Therefore, ye<br>children, ye have nothing to fear; do what I say.' The young ones again<br>said, 'We do not, O mother, say that thou art dispelling our fears with a<br>false story. For whatever is done by a person when his reason hath been<br>disturbed can scarcely be said to be that person's deliberate act. Thou<br>hast not been benefited by us, nor dost thou know who we are. Why dost<br>thou, therefore, strive to protect us at so much cost to thyself? Who are<br>we to thee? Thou art young and handsome, and capable of seeking out thy<br>husband. Go unto thy husband. Thou shalt obtain good children again. Let<br>us by entering the fire attain to regions of felicity. If, however, the<br>fire consume us not, thou mayest come back and obtain us again.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'The parent bird then, thus addressed by her sons,<br>left them in Khandava and hastily went to the spot where there was no<br>fire and there was safety. Then Agni in haste and with fierce flames<br>approached the spot where the sons of Mandapala were. The young birds saw<br>the blazing fire come towards them. Then Jaritari, the eldest of the<br>four, in the hearing of Agni, began to speak.'"
