                            (Arjuna-vanavasa Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then that bull of Bharata's race went to the sacred<br>waters on the banks of the southern ocean, all adorned with the ascetics<br>residing there. And there lay scattered five such regions where also<br>dwelt many ascetics. But those five waters themselves were shunned by all<br>of them. Those sacred waters were called Agastya, and Saubhadra and<br>Pauloma of great holiness, and Karandhama of great propitiousness<br>yielding the fruits of a horse-sacrifice unto those that bathed there,<br>and Bharadwaja, that great washer of sins. That foremost one among the<br>Kurus, beholding those five sacred waters, and finding them uninhabited,<br>and ascertaining also that they were shunned by the virtuous ascetics<br>dwelling around, asked those pious men with joined hands, saying, 'Why O<br>ascetics, are these five sacred waters shunned by utterers of Brahma?'<br>Hearing him, the ascetics replied, 'There dwell in these waters five<br>large crocodiles which take away the ascetics that may happen to bathe in<br>them. It is for this, O son of Kuru's race, that these waters are<br>shunned.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of the ascetics, that<br>foremost of men endued with mighty arms, though dissuaded by them went to<br>behold those waters. Arrived at the excellent sacred water called<br>Saubhadra after a great Rishi, the brave scorcher of all foes suddenly<br>plunged into it to have a bath. As soon as that tiger among men had<br>plunged into the water a great crocodile (that was in it) seized him by<br>the leg. But the strong-armed Dhananjaya the son of Kunti, that foremost<br>of all men endued with might, seized that struggling ranger of the water<br>and dragged it forcibly to the shore. But dragged by the renowned Arjuna<br>to the land, that crocodile became (transformed into) a beautiful damsel<br>bedecked with ornament. O king, that charming damsel of celestial form<br>seemed to shine for her beauty and complexion. Dhananjaya, the son of<br>Kunti, beholding that strange sight, asked that damsel with a pleased<br>heart, 'Who art thou, O beautiful one? Why hast thou been a ranger of the<br>waters? Why also didst thou commit such a dreadful sin?' The damsel<br>replied, saying, 'I am, O mighty-armed one, an Apsara that sported in the<br>celestial woods. I am, O mighty one, Varga by name, and ever dear unto<br>the celestial treasurer (Kuvera). I have four other companions, all<br>handsome and capable of going everywhere at will. Accompanied by them I<br>was one day going to the abode of Kuvera. On the way we beheld a Brahmana<br>of rigid vows, and exceedingly handsome, studying the Vedas in solitude.<br>The whole forest (in which he was sitting) seemed to be covered with his<br>ascetic splendour. He seemed to have illuminated the whole region like<br>the Sun himself. Beholding his ascetic devotion of that nature and his<br>wonderful beauty, we alighted in that region, in order to disturb his<br>meditations. Myself and Saurabheyi and Samichi and Vudvuda and Lata,<br>approached that Brahmana, O Bharata, at the same time. We began to sing<br>and smile and otherwise tempt that Brahmana. But, O hero, that Brahmana<br>(youth) set not his heart even once upon us. His mind fixed on pure<br>meditation, that youth of great energy suffered not his heart to waver, O<br>bull among Kshatriyas, the glance he cast upon us was one of wrath. And<br>he said, staring at us, 'Becoming crocodiles, range ye the waters for a<br>hundred years.'"
