                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said. 'There was a king of the name of Pratipa, who was<br>kind to all creatures. He spent many years in ascetic penances at the<br>source of the river Ganga. The accomplished and lovely Ganga, one day,<br>assuming the form of a beautiful female, and rising from the waters, made<br>up to the monarch. The celestial maiden, endued with ravishing beauty,<br>approached the royal sage engaged in ascetic austerities, and sat upon<br>his right thigh that was, for manly strength, a veritable Sala tree. When<br>the maiden of handsome face had so sat upon his lap, the monarch said<br>unto her, 'O amiable one, what dost thou desire? What shall I do?' The<br>damsel answered, 'I desire thee, O king, for my husband! O foremost one<br>of the Kurus, be mine! To refuse a woman coming of her own accord is<br>never applauded by the wise.' Pratipa answered, 'O thou of the fairest<br>complexion, moved by lust, I never go in unto others' wives or women that<br>are not of my order. This, indeed, is my virtuous vow.' The maiden<br>rejoined, 'I am not inauspicious or ugly. I am every way worthy of being<br>enjoyed. I am a celestial maiden of rare beauty; I desire thee for my<br>husband. Refuse me not, O king.' To this Pratipa answered, 'I am, 'O<br>damsel, abstaining from that course to which thou wouldst incite me. If I<br>break my vow, sin will overwhelm and kill me. O thou of the fairest<br>complexion, thou hast embraced me, sitting on my right thigh. But, O<br>timid one, know that this is the seat for daughters and daughters-in-law.<br>The left lap is for the wife, but thou hast not accepted that. Therefore,<br>O best of women, I cannot enjoy thee as an object of desire. Be my<br>daughter-in-law. I accept thee for my son!'<br><br>"The damsel then said, 'O virtuous one, let it be as thou sayest. Let me<br>be united with thy son. From my respect for thee, I shall be a wife of<br>the celebrated Bharata race. Ye (of the Bharata race) are the refuge of<br>all the monarchs on earth! I am incapable of numbering the virtues of<br>this race even within a hundred years. The greatness and goodness of many<br>celebrated monarchs of this race are limitless. O lord of all, let it be<br>understood now that when I become thy daughter-in-law, thy son shall not<br>be able to judge of the propriety of my acts. Living thus with thy son, I<br>shall do good to him and increase his happiness. And he shall finally<br>attain to heaven in consequence of the sons I shall bear him, and of his<br>virtues and good conduct.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'O king, having said so, the celestial damsel<br>disappeared then and there. And the king, too, waited for the birth of<br>his son in order to fulfil his promise.'<br><br>"About this time Pratipa, that light of the Kuru race, that bull amongst<br>Kshatriyas, was engaged, along with his wife, in austerities from desire<br>of offspring. And when they had grown old, a son was born unto them. This<br>was no other than Mahabhisha. And the child was called Santanu because he<br>was born when his father had controlled his passions by ascetic penances.<br>And the best of Kurus, Santanu, knowing that region of indestructible<br>bliss can be acquired by one's deeds alone, became devoted to virtue.<br>When Santanu grew up into a youth, Pratipa addressed him and said, 'Some<br>time ago, O Santanu, a celestial damsel came to me for thy good. If thou<br>meetest that fair-complexioned one in secret and if she solicit thee for<br>children, accept her as thy wife. And, O sinless one, judge not of the<br>propriety or impropriety of her action and ask not who she is, or whose<br>or whence, but accept her as thy wife at my command!'" Vaisampayana<br>continued, 'Pratipa, having thus commanded his son Santanu and installed<br>him on his throne, retired into the woods. And king Santanu endued with<br>great intelligence and equal unto Indra himself in splendour, became<br>addicted to hunting and passed much of his time in the woods. And the<br>best of monarchs always slew deer and buffaloes. And one day, as he was<br>wandering along the bank of the Ganges, he came upon a region frequented<br>by Siddhas and Charanas. And there he saw a lovely maiden of blazing<br>beauty and like unto another Sri herself; of faultless and pearly teeth<br>and decked with celestial ornaments, and attired in garments of fine<br>texture that resembled in splendour the filaments of the lotus. And the<br>monarch, on beholding that damsel, became surprised, and his raptures<br>produced instant horripilation. With steadfast gaze he seemed to be<br>drinking her charms, but repeated draughts failed to quench his thirst.<br>The damsel also beholding the monarch of blazing splendour moving about<br>in great agitation, was moved herself and experienced an affection for<br>him. She gazed and gazed and longed to gaze on him evermore. The monarch<br>then in soft words addressed her and said, 'O slender-waisted one, be<br>thou a goddess or the daughter of a Danava, be thou of the race of the<br>Gandharvas, or Apsaras, be thou of the Yakshas or the Nagas, or be thou<br>of human origin, O thou of celestial beauty, I solicit thee to be my<br>wife!'"
