                            (Chaitraratha Parva continued)<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'Saying this, Tapati of faultless features,<br>ascended the skies. The monarch thereupon again fell down on the earth.<br>His ministers and followers searching for him throughout the forest at<br>length came upon him lying on that solitary spot, and beholding that<br>excellent king, that mighty bowman, thus lying forsaken on the ground<br>like a rainbow dropped from the firmament, his minister-in-chief became<br>like one burnt by a flame of fire. Advancing hastily with affection and<br>respect, the minister raised that best of monarchs lying prostrate on the<br>ground and deprived of his senses by desire. Old in wisdom as in age, old<br>in achievements as in policy, the minister, after having raised the<br>prostrate monarch, became easy (in mind). Addressing the king in sweet<br>words that were also for his good, he said, 'Blest be thou, O sinless<br>one! Fear not, O tiger among kings!' The minister thought that the<br>monarch, that great feller of hostile ranks in battle, had been lying on<br>the ground overcome with hunger, thirst, and fatigue. The old man then<br>sprinkled over the crownless head of the monarch water that was cold and<br>rendered fragrant with lotus-petals. Slowly regaining his consciousness,<br>the mighty monarch sent away all his attendants with the exception of his<br>minister only. After those attendants had retired at his command, the<br>king sat upon the mountain-breast. Having purified himself duly, the king<br>sat upon that chief of mountains, and began, with joined palms and<br>upturned face, to worship Surya. King Samvarana, that smiter of all foes,<br>thought also of his chief priest Vasishtha, that best of Rishis. The king<br>continued to sit there day and night without intermission. The Brahmana<br>sage Vasishtha came there on the twelfth day: that great Rishi of soul<br>under perfect command knew at once by his ascetic power that the monarch<br>had lost his senses in consequence of Tapati. And that virtuous and best<br>of Munis, as soon as he knew this, desirous of benefiting the monarch who<br>was ever observant of vows, addressed him and gave him every assurance.<br>The illustrious Rishi, in the very sight of that monarch, ascended upward<br>to interview Surya, himself possessed of the splendour of that luminary.<br>The Brahmana then approached with joined hands the god of a thousand rays<br>and introduced himself cheerfully unto him, saying, 'I am Vasishtha.'<br>Then Vivaswat of great energy said unto that best of Rishis, 'Welcome art<br>thou, O great Rishi! Tell me what is in thy mind. O thou of great good<br>fortune, whatever thou demandest of me, O foremost of eloquent men, I<br>will confer on thee, however difficult it may be for me!' Thus addressed<br>by Surya, the Rishi of great ascetic merit, bowing unto the god of light,<br>replied, saying, 'O Vibhavasu, this thy daughter, Tapati, the younger<br>sister of Savitri, I ask of thee for Samvarana! That monarch is of mighty<br>achievements, conversant with virtue, and of high soul. O<br>firmament-ranger, Samvarana will make a worthy husband for thy daughter.'<br>Thus addressed by the Rishi Vibhakara, resolved upon bestowing his<br>daughter upon Samvarana, saluted the Rishi, and replied unto him, saying,<br>'Oh, Samvarana is the best of monarchs, thou art the best of Rishis,<br>Tapati is the best of women. What should we do, therefore, but bestow her<br>on Samvarana?' With these words, the god Tapana, made over his daughter,<br>Tapati, of every feature perfectly faultless, unto the illustrious<br>Vasishtha to bestow her upon Samvarana. And the great Rishi then accepted<br>the girl, Tapati, and taking leave of Surya, came back to the spot, where<br>that bull amongst the Kurus, of celestial achievements, was. King<br>Samvarana, possessed by love and with his heart fixed on Tapati,<br>beholding that celestial maiden of sweet smiles led by Vasishtha, became<br>exceedingly glad. And Tapati of fair eyebrows came down from the<br>firmament like lightning from the clouds, dazzling the ten points of the<br>heavens. And the illustrious Rishi Vasishtha of pure soul approached the<br>monarch after the latter's twelve nights' vow was over. It was thus that<br>king Samvarana obtained a wife after having worshipped with like the full<br>moon. And that mighty bowman, that foremost one in Kuru's race having his<br>curiosity greatly excited by what he heard of Vasishtha's ascetic power,<br>asked the Gandharva, saying, 'I desire to hear of the Rishi whom thou<br>hast mentioned as Vasishtha. O, tell me in full about him! O chief of the<br>Gandharvas, tell me who this illustrious Rishi was that was the priest of<br>our forefathers.' The Gandharva replied, 'Vasishtha is Brahma's spiritual<br>(lit, mind-born) son and Arundhati's husband. Ever difficult of being<br>conquered by the very immortals, Desire and Wrath, conquered by<br>Vasishtha's ascetic penances, used to shampoo his feet. Though his wrath<br>was excited by Viswamitra's offence, that high-souled Rishi did not yet<br>exterminate Kusikas (the tribe whose king Viswamitra was). Afflicted at<br>the loss of his sons, he did not, as though powerless, though really<br>otherwise, do any dreadful act destructive of Viswamitra, Like the ocean<br>transgressing not its continents, Vasishtha transgressed not (the laws<br>of) Yama by bringing back his children from the domains of the king of<br>the dead. It was by obtaining that illustrious one who had conquered his<br>own self that Ikshvaku and other great monarchs acquired the whole earth.<br>And, O prince of Kuru's race, it was by obtaining Vasishtha, that best of<br>Rishis as their priest, that those monarchs performed many grand<br>sacrifices. And, O best of the Pandavas, that regenerate Rishi assisted<br>these monarchs in the performance of their sacrifices like Vrihaspati<br>assisting the immortals. Therefore, look ye for some accomplished and<br>desirable Brahmana conversant with the Vedas and in whose heart virtue<br>prevails, to appoint as your priest. A Kshatriya of good lineage,<br>desirous of extending his dominions by conquering the earth, should, O<br>Partha, first appoint a priest. He who is desirous of conquering the<br>earth should have a Brahmana before him. Therefore, O Arjuna, let some<br>accomplished and learned Brahmana, who has his senses under complete<br>control and who is conversant with religion, profit and pleasure, be your<br>priest.'"<br><br><br><br>Section CLXXVII<br><br>(Chaitraratha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing this, Arjuna said, 'O Gandharva, whence<br>arose the hostility between Viswamitra and Vasishtha both of whom dwelt<br>in a celestial hermitage? O, tell us all about it.'<br><br>"The Gandharva replied, 'O Partha, the story of Vasishtha is regarded as<br>a Purana (legend) in all the three worlds. Listen to me as I recite it<br>fully. There was, in Kanyakuvja, O bull of Bharata's race, a great king<br>of worldwide fame named Gadhi, the son of Kusika. The virtuous Gadhi had<br>a son named Viswamitra, that grinder of foes, possessing a large army and<br>many animals and vehicles. And Viswamitra, accompanied by his ministers,<br>used to roam in quest of deer through the deep woods and over picturesque<br>marascetic penances the propitious lord Vivaswat, by the help of<br>Vasishtha's (ascetic power). And Samvarana, that bull among men with due<br>rites took Tapati's hand on that mountain-breast which was resorted to by<br>the celestials and the Gandharvas. The royal sage, with the permission of<br>Vasishtha, desired to sport with his wife on that mountain. And the king<br>caused Vasishtha, to be proclaimed his regent in his capital and kingdom,<br>in the woods and gardens. And bidding farewell unto the monarch,<br>Vasishtha left him and went away. Samvarana, who sported on that mountain<br>like a celestial, sported with his wife in the woods and the under-woods<br>on that mountain for twelve full years. And, O best of the Bharatas, the<br>god of a thousand eyes poured no rain for twelve years on the capital and<br>on the kingdom of that monarch. Then, O chastiser of enemies, when that<br>season of drought broke out, the people of that kingdom, as also the<br>trees and lower animals began to die fast. And during the continuance of<br>that dreadful drought, not even a drop of dew fell from the skies and no<br>corn grew. And the inhabitants in despair, and afflicted with the fear of<br>hunger, left their homes and fled away in all directions. And the<br>famished people of the capital and the country began to abandon their<br>wives and children and grew reckless of one another. The people being<br>afflicted with hunger, without a morsel of food and reduced to skeletons,<br>the capital looked very much like the city of the king of the dead, full<br>of only ghostly beings. On beholding the capital reduced to such a state,<br>the illustrious and virtuous and best of Rishis, Vasishtha was resolved<br>upon applying a remedy and brought back unto the city that tiger among<br>kings, Samvarana, along with his wife, after the latter had passed so<br>long a period in solitude and seclusion. After the king had entered his<br>capital, things became as before, for, when that tiger among kings came<br>back to his own, the god of a thousand eyes, the slayer of Asuras, poured<br>rain in abundance and caused corn to grow. Revivified by the foremost of<br>virtuous souls the capital and the country became animated with extreme<br>joy. The monarch, with his wife, Tapati, once more performed sacrifices<br>for twelve years, like the lord Indra (god of rain) performing sacrifices<br>with his wife, Sachi.'<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'This, O Partha, is the history of Tapati of<br>old, the daughter of Vivaswat. It is for her that thou art (called)<br>Tapatya. King Samvarana begot upon Tapati a son named Kuru, who was the<br>foremost of ascetics. Born in the race of Kuru, thou art, O Arjuna, to be<br>called Tapatya.'"
