                            (Hidimva-vadha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Those mighty car-warriors, the heroic Pandavas, then<br>went, O king, from forest to forest killing deer and many animals (for<br>their food). And in the course of their wanderings they saw the countries<br>of the Matsyas, the Trigartas, the Panchalas and then of the Kichakas,<br>and also many beautiful woods and lakes therein. And they all had matted<br>locks on their heads and were attired in barks of trees and the skins of<br>animals. Indeed, with Kunti in their company those illustrious heroes<br>were attired in the garbs of ascetics. And those mighty car-warriors<br>sometimes proceeded in haste, carrying their mother on their backs; and<br>sometimes they proceeded in disguise, and sometimes again with great<br>celerity. And they used to study the Rik and the other Vedas and also all<br>the Vedangas as well as the sciences of morals and politics. And the<br>Pandavas, conversant with the science of morals, met, in course of their<br>wanderings their grandfather (Vyasa). And saluting the illustrious<br>Krishna-Dwaipayana, those chastisers of enemies, with their mother, stood<br>before him with joined hands.'<br><br>"Vyasa then said, 'Ye bulls of Bharata's race, I knew beforehand of this<br>affliction of yours consisting in your deceitful exile by the son of<br>Dhritarashtra. Knowing this, I have come to you, desirous of doing you<br>some great good. Do not grieve for what hath befallen you. Know that all<br>this is for your happiness. Undoubtedly, the sons of Dhritarashtra and<br>you are all equal in my eye. But men are always partial to those who are<br>in misfortune or of tender years. It is therefore, that my affection for<br>you is greater now. And in consequence of that affection, I desire to do<br>you good. Listen to me! Not far off before you is a delightful town where<br>no danger can overtake you. Live ye there in disguise, waiting for my<br>return.'<br><br>'Vaisampayana continued, 'Vyasa, the son of Satyavati, thus comforting<br>the Pandavas, led them into the town of Ekachakra. And the master also<br>comforted Kunti, saying, 'Live, O daughter! This son of thine,<br>Yudhishthira, ever devoted to truth, this illustrious bull among men,<br>having by his justice conquered the whole world, will rule over all the<br>other monarchs of the earth. There is little doubt that, having by means<br>of Bhima's and Arjuna's prowess conquered the whole earth with her belt<br>of seas, he will enjoy the sovereignty thereof. Thy sons as well as those<br>of Madri&#8212;mighty car-warriors all&#8212;will cheerfully sport as pleaseth them<br>in their dominions. These tigers among men will also perform various<br>sacrifices, such as the Rajasuya and the horse-sacrifice, in which the<br>presents unto the Brahmanas are very large. And these thy sons will rule<br>their ancestral kingdom, maintaining their friends and relatives in<br>luxury and affluence and happiness.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'With these words Vyasa introduced them into the<br>dwelling of a Brahmana. And the island-born Rishi, addressing the eldest<br>of the Pandavas, said, 'Wait here for me! I will come back to you! By<br>adapting yourselves to the country and the occasion you will succeed in<br>becoming very happy.'<br><br>"Then, O king, the Pandavas with joined hands said unto the Rishi, 'So be<br>it.' And the illustrious master, the Rishi Vyasa, then went away to the<br>region whence he had come.'"
