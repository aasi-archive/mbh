                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'O ascetic, about this time the two sisters saw approaching<br>near, that steed of complacent appearance named Uchchaihsravas who was<br>worshipped by the gods, that gem of steeds, who arose at the churning of<br>the Ocean for nectar. Divine, graceful, perpetually young, creation's<br>master-piece, and of irresistible vigour, it was blest with every<br>auspicious mark.'<br><br>"Saunaka asked, 'Why did the gods churn the Ocean for nectar, and under<br>what circumstances and when as you say, did that best of steeds so<br>powerful and resplendent spring?'<br><br>"Sauti said, 'There is a mountain named Meru, of blazing appearance, and<br>looking like a heap of effulgence. The rays of the Sun falling on its<br>peaks of golden lustre are dispersed by them. Decked with gold and<br>exceedingly beautiful, that mountain is the haunt of the gods and the<br>Gandharvas. It is immeasurable and unapproachable by men of manifold<br>sins. Dreadful beasts of prey wander over its breasts, and it is<br>illuminated by many divine life-giving herbs. It stands kissing the<br>heavens by its height and is the first of mountains. Ordinary people<br>cannot even think of ascending it. It is graced with trees and streams,<br>and resounds with the charming melody of winged choirs. Once the<br>celestials sat on its begemmed peak&#8212;in conclave. They who had practised<br>penances and observed excellent vows for amrita now seemed to be eager<br>seekers alter amrita (celestial ambrosia). Seeing the celestial assembly<br>in anxious mood Nara-yana said to Brahman, 'Do thou churn the Ocean with<br>the gods and the Asuras. By doing so, amrita will be obtained as also all<br>drugs and gems. O ye gods, chum the Ocean, ye will discover amrita.'"<br><br>So ends the seventeenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.
