                            (Arjuna-vanavasa Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then the son of the wielder of the thunderbolt<br>narrated everything unto those Brahmanas (residing with him there), set<br>out for the breast of Himavat. Arriving at the spot called Agastyavata,<br>he next went to Vasishtha's peak. Thence the son of Kunti proceeded to<br>the peak of Bhrigu. Purifying himself with ablutions and other rites<br>there, that foremost of the Kurus gave away unto Brahmanas many thousands<br>of cows and many houses. Thence that best of men proceeded to the sacred<br>asylum called Hiranyavindu. Performing his ablutions there, that foremost<br>of the sons of Pandu saw many holy regions. Descending from those heights<br>that chief of men, O Bharata, accompanied by the Brahmanas, journeyed<br>towards the east, desiring to behold the regions that lay in that<br>direction. That foremost one of Kuru's race saw many regions of sacred<br>waters one after another. And beholding in the forest of Naimisha the<br>delightful river Utpalini (full of lotuses) and the Nanda and the Apara<br>Nanda, the far-famed Kausiki, and the mighty rivers Gaya and Ganga, and<br>all the regions of sacred water, he purified himself, O Bharata, (with<br>the usual rites), and gave away many cows unto Brahmanas. Whatever<br>regions of sacred waters and whatever other holy palaces there were in<br>Vanga and Kalinga, Arjuna visited all of them. Seeing them all and<br>performing proper ceremonies, he gave away much wealth. Then, O Bharata,<br>all those Brahmanas following the son of Pandu, bade him farewell at the<br>gate of the kingdom of Kalinga and desisted from proceeding with him any<br>further. The brave Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, obtaining their leave,<br>went towards the ocean, accompanied by only a few attendants. Crossing<br>the country of the Kalingas, the mighty one proceeded, seeing on his way<br>diverse countries and sacred spots and diverse delightful mansions and<br>houses. Beholding the Mahendra mountain adorned with the ascetics<br>(residing there), he went to Manipura, proceeding slowly along the<br>sea-shore. Beholding all the sacred waters and other holy places in that<br>province, the strong-armed son of Pandu at last went, O king, to the<br>virtuous Chitravahana, the ruler of Manipura. The king of Manipura had a<br>daughter of great beauty named Chitrangada. And it so happened that<br>Arjuna beheld her in her father's palace roving at pleasure. Beholding<br>the handsome daughter of Chitravahana, Arjuna desired to possess her.<br>Going unto the king (her father), he represented unto him what he sought.<br>He said. 'Give away unto me thy daughter, O king! I am an illustrious<br>Kshatriya's son.' Hearing this, the king asked him, 'Whose son art thou?'<br>Arjuna replied, 'I am Dhananjaya, the son of Pandu and Kunti.' The king,<br>hearing this, spoke unto him these words in sweet accents, 'There was in<br>our race a king of the name of Prabhanjana, who was childless. To obtain<br>a child, he underwent severe ascetic penances. By his severe asceticism,<br>O Partha, he gratified that god of gods, Mahadeva, the husband of Uma,<br>that supreme Lord holding (the mighty bow called) Pinaka. The illustrious<br>Lord granted him the boon that each successive descendant of his race<br>should have one child only. In consequence of that boon only one child is<br>born unto every successive descendant of this race. All my ancestors (one<br>after another) had each a male child. I, however, have only a daughter to<br>perpetuate my race. But, O bull amongst men, I ever look upon this<br>daughter of mine as my son. O bull of Bharata's race, I have duly made<br>her a Putrika. Therefore, one amongst the sons that may be begotten upon<br>her by thee, O Bharata, shall be the perpetuator of my race. That son is<br>the dower for which I may give away my daughter. O son of Pandu, if them<br>choosest, thou canst take her upon this understanding.' Hearing these<br>words of the king, Arjuna accepted them all, saying, 'So be it.' Taking<br>Chitravahana's daughter (as his wife), the son of Kunti resided in that<br>city for three years. When Chitrangada at last gave birth to a son,<br>Arjuna embraced that handsome princess affectionately. And taking leave<br>of the king (her father), he set out on his wanderings again.'"
