                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'O monarch, after the nuptials were over, king<br>Santanu established his beautiful bride in his household. Soon after was<br>born of Satyavati an intelligent and heroic son of Santanu named<br>Chitrangada. He was endued with great energy and became an eminent man.<br>The lord Santanu of great prowess also begat upon Satyavati another son<br>named Vichitravirya, who became a mighty bowman and who became king after<br>his father. And before that bull among men, viz., Vichitravirya, attained<br>to majority, the wise king Santanu realised the inevitable influence of<br>Time. And after Santanu had ascended to heaven. Bhishma, placing himself<br>under the command of Satyavati, installed that suppressor of foes, viz.,<br>Chitrangada, on the throne, who, having soon vanquished by his prowess<br>all monarchs, considered not any man as his equal. And beholding that he<br>could vanquish men, Asuras, and the very gods, his namesake, the powerful<br>king of the Gandharvas, approached him for an encounter. Between that<br>Gandharva and that foremost one of the Kurus, who were both very<br>powerful, there occurred on the field of Kurukshetra a fierce combat<br>which lasted full three years on the banks of the Saraswati. In that<br>terrible encounter characterised by thick showers of weapons and in which<br>the combatants ground each other fiercely, the Gandharva, who had greater<br>prowess or strategic deception, slew the Kuru prince. Having slain<br>Chitrangada&#8212;that first of men and oppressor of foes&#8212;the Gandharva<br>ascended to heaven. When that tiger among men endued with great prowess<br>was slain, Bhishma, the son of Santanu, performed, O king, all his<br>obsequies. He then installed the boy Vichitravirya of mighty arms, still<br>in his minority, on the throne of the Kurus. And Vichitravirya, placing<br>himself under the command of Bhishma, ruled the ancestral kingdom. And he<br>adored Santanu's son Bhishma who was conversant with all the rules of<br>religion and law; so, indeed, Bhishma also protected him that was so<br>obedient to the dictates of duty.'"
