                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Meanwhile the Kauravas and the Pandavas, after<br>having thus sported there, set out, without Bhima, for Hastinapura, some<br>on horses, some on elephants, while others preferred cars and other<br>conveyances. And on their way they said to one another, 'Perhaps, Bhima<br>hath gone before us.' And the wicked Duryodhana was glad at heart to miss<br>Bhima, and entered the city with his brothers in joy.<br><br>"The virtuous Yudhishthira, himself unacquainted with vice and<br>wickedness, regarded others to be as honest as himself. The eldest son of<br>Pritha, filled with fraternal love, going unto his mother, said, after<br>making obeisance to her, 'O mother, hath Bhima come? O good mother, I<br>don't find him here. Where may he have gone? We long sought for him<br>everywhere in the gardens and the beautiful woods; but found him nowhere.<br>At length, we thought that the heroic Bhima preceded us all. O<br>illustrious dame, we came hither in great anxiety. Arrived here, where<br>hath he gone? Have you sent him anywhere? O tell me, I am full of doubts<br>respecting the mighty Bhima. He had been asleep and hath not come. I<br>conclude he is no more.'<br><br>"Hearing these words of the highly intelligent Yudhishthira, Kunti<br>shrieked, in alarm, and said, 'Dear son, I have not seen Bhima. He did<br>not come to me. O, return in haste, and with your brothers search for<br>him.'<br><br>"Having said this in affliction to her eldest son, she summoned Vidura,<br>and said, 'O illustrious Kshattri, Bhimasena is missing! Where has he<br>gone? The other brothers have all come back from the gardens, only Bhima<br>of mighty arms does not come home! Duryodhana likes him not. The Kaurava<br>is crooked and malicious and low-minded and imprudent. He coveteth the<br>throne openly. I am afraid he may have in a fit of anger slain my<br>darling. This afflicts me sorely, indeed, it burns my heart.'<br><br>"Vidura replied, 'Blessed dame, say not so! Protect thy other sons with<br>care. If the wicked Duryodhana be accused, he may slay thy remaining<br>sons. The great sage hath said that all thy sons will be long-lived.<br>Therefore, Bhima will surely return and gladden thy heart.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The wise Vidura, having said this unto Kunti,<br>returned to his abode, while Kunti, in great anxiety, continued to stay<br>at home with her children.<br><br>"Meanwhile, Bhimasena awoke from that slumber on the eighth day, and felt<br>strong beyond measure in consequence of the nectar he had taken having<br>been all digested. Seeing him awake, the Nagas began to console and cheer<br>him, saying, 'O thou of mighty arms, the strength-giving liquor thou hast<br>drunk will give thee the might of ten thousand elephants! No one now will<br>be able to vanquish thee in fight. O bull of Kuru's race, do thou bath in<br>this holy and auspicious water and return home. Thy brothers are<br>disconsolate because of thee.'<br><br>"Then Bhima purified himself with a bath in those waters, and decked in<br>white robes and flowery garlands of the same hue, ate of the paramanna<br>(rice and sugar pudding) offered to him by the Nagas. Then that oppressor<br>of all foes, decked in celestial ornaments, received the adorations and<br>blessings of the snakes, and saluting them in return, rose from the<br>nether region. Bearing up the lotus-eyed Pandava from under the waters,<br>the Nagas placed him in the selfsame gardens wherein he had been<br>sporting, and vanished in his very sight.<br><br>"The mighty Bhimasena, arrived on the surface of the earth, ran with<br>speed to his mother. And bowing down unto her and his eldest brother, and<br>smelling the heads of his younger brothers, that oppressor of all foes<br>was himself embraced by his mother and every one of those bulls among<br>men. Affectionate unto one another, they all repeatedly exclaimed, 'What<br>is our joy today, O what joy!'<br><br>'Then Bhima, endued with great strength and prowess, related to his<br>brothers everything about the villainy of Duryodhana, and the lucky and<br>unlucky incidents that had befallen him in the world of the Serpents.<br>Thereupon Yudhishthira said, 'Do thou observe silence on this. Do not<br>speak of this to any one. From this day, protect ye all one another with<br>care.' Thus cautioned by the righteous Yudhishthira, they all, with<br>Yudhishthira himself, became very vigilant from that day. And lest<br>negligence might occur on the part of the sons of Kunti, Vidura<br>continually offered them sage advice.<br><br>"Some time after, Duryodhana again mixed in the food of Bhima a poison<br>that was fresh, virulent, and very deadly. But Yuyutsu (Dhritarashtra's<br>son by a Vaisya wife), moved by his friendship for the Pandavas, informed<br>them of this. Vrikodara, however, swallowed it without any hesitation,<br>and digested it completely. And, though virulent the poison produced no<br>effects on Bhima.<br><br>"When that terrible poison intended for the destruction of Bhima failed<br>of its effect, Duryodhana. Karna and Sakuni, without giving up their<br>wicked design had recourse to numerous other contrivances for<br>accomplishing the death of the Pandavas. And though every one of these<br>contrivances was fully known to the Pandavas, yet in accordance with the<br>advice of Vidura they suppressed their indignation.<br><br>"Meanwhile, the king (Dhritarashtra), beholding the Kuru princes passing<br>their time in idleness and growing naughty, appointed Gautama as their<br>preceptor and sent them unto him for instruction. Born among a clump of<br>heath, Gautama was well-skilled in the Vedas and it was under him (also<br>called Kripa) that the Kuru princes began to learn the use of arms.'"
