                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said. 'The large-eyed daughter of Kuntibhoja, Pritha by<br>name, was endued with beauty and every accomplishment. Of rigid vows, she<br>was devoted to virtue and possessed of every good quality. But though<br>endued with beauty and youth and every womanly attribute, yet it so<br>happened that no king asked-for her hand. Her father Kuntibhoja seeing<br>this, invited, O best of monarchs, the princes and kings of other<br>countries and desired his daughter to select her husband from among her<br>guests. The intelligent Kunti, entering the amphitheatre, beheld<br>Pandu&#8212;the foremost of the Bharatas&#8212;that tiger among kings&#8212;in that<br>concourse of crowned heads. Proud as the lion, broad-chested, bull-eyed,<br>endued with great strength, and outshining all other monarchs in<br>splendour, he looked like another Indra in that royal assemblage. The<br>amiable daughter of Kuntibhoja, of faultless features, beholding<br>Pandu&#8212;that best of men&#8212;in that assembly, became very much agitated. And<br>advancing with modesty, all the while quivering with emotion, she placed<br>the nuptial garland about Pandu's neck. The other monarchs, seeing Kunti<br>choose Pandu for her lord, returned to their respective kingdoms on<br>elephants, horses and cars, as they had come. Then, O king, the bride's<br>father caused the nuptial rites to be performed duly. The Kuru prince<br>blessed with great good fortune and the daughter of Kuntibhoja formed a<br>couple like Maghavat and Paulomi (the king and queen of the celestials).<br>And, O best of Kuru monarchs, king Kuntibhoja, after the nuptials were<br>over, presented his son-in-law with much wealth and sent him back to his<br>capital. Then the Kuru prince Pandu, accompanied by a large force bearing<br>various kinds of banners and pennons, and eulogised by Brahmanas and<br>great Rishis pronouncing benedictions, reached his capital. And after<br>arriving at his own palace, he established his queen therein.'"
