                            (Jatugriha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Seeing the Pandavas living there cheerfully and<br>without suspicion for a full year, Purochana became exceedingly glad. And<br>beholding Purochana so very glad, Yudhishthira, the virtuous son of<br>Kunti, addressing Bhima and Arjuna and the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva)<br>said, 'The cruel-hearted wretch hath been well-deceived. I think the time<br>is come for our escape. Setting fire to the arsenal and burning Purochana<br>to death and letting his body lie here, let us, six persons, fly hence<br>unobserved by all!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then on the occasion of an almsgiving, O king,<br>Kunti fed on a certain night a large number of Brahmanas. There came also<br>a number of ladies who while eating and drinking, enjoyed there as they<br>pleased, and with Kunti's leave returned to their respective homes.<br>Desirous of obtaining food, there came, as though impelled by fate, to<br>that feast, in course of her wanderings, a Nishada woman, the mother of<br>five children, accompanied by all her sons. O king, she, and her<br>children, intoxicated with the wine they drank, became incapable.<br>Deprived of consciousness and more dead than alive, she with all her sons<br>lay down in that mansion to sleep. Then when all the inmates of the house<br>lay down to sleep, there began to blow a violent wind in the night. Bhima<br>then set fire to the house just where Purochana was sleeping. Then the<br>son of Pandu set fire to the door of that house of lac. Then he set fire<br>to the mansion in several parts all around. Then when the sons of Pandu<br>were satisfied that the house had caught fire in several parts those<br>chastisers of foes with their mother, entered the subterranean passage<br>without losing any time. Then the heat and the roar of the fire became<br>intense and awakened the townspeople. Beholding the house in flames, the<br>citizens with sorrowful faces began to say, 'The wretch (Purochana) of<br>wicked soul had under the instruction of Duryodhana built his house for<br>the destruction of his employer's relatives. He indeed hath set fire to<br>it. O, fie on Dhritarashtra's heart which is so partial. He hath burnt to<br>death, as if he were their foe, the sinless heirs of Pandu! O, the sinful<br>and wicked-souled (Purochana) who hath burnt those best of men, the<br>innocent and unsuspicious princes, hath himself been burnt to death as<br>fate would have it.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The citizens of Varanavata thus bewailed (the<br>fate of the Pandavas), and waited there for the whole night surrounding<br>that house. The Pandavas, however, accompanied by their mother coming out<br>of the subterranean passage, fled in haste unnoticed. But those<br>chastisers of foes, for sleepiness and fear, could not with their mother<br>proceed in haste. But, O monarch, Bhimasena, endued with terrible prowess<br>and swiftness of motion took upon his body all his brothers and mother<br>and began to push through the darkness. Placing his mother on his<br>shoulder, the twins on his sides, and Yudhishthira and Arjuna on both his<br>arms, Vrikodara of great energy and strength and endued with the speed of<br>the wind, commenced his march, breaking the trees with his breast and<br>pressing deep the earth with his stamp.'"
