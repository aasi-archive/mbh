                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'O sinless one, thou hast narrated to me from the<br>beginning all about the birth of Dhritarashtra's hundred sons owing to<br>the boon granted by the Rishi. But thou hast not told me as yet any<br>particulars about the birth of the daughter. Thou hast merely said that<br>over and above the hundred sons, there was another son named Yuyutsu<br>begotten upon a Vaisya woman, and a daughter. The great Rishi Vyasa of<br>immeasurable energy said unto the daughter of the king of Gandhara that<br>she would become the mother of a hundred sons. Illustrious one, how is<br>that thou sayest Gandhari had a daughter over and above her hundred sons?<br>If the ball of flesh was distributed by the great Rishi only into a<br>hundred parts, and if Gandhari did not conceive on any other occasion,<br>how was then Duhsala born. Tell me this, O Rishi! my curiosity hath been<br>great."<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'O descendant of the Pandavas, thy question is just,<br>and I will tell thee how it happened. The illustrious and great Rishi<br>himself, by sprinkling water over that ball of flesh, began to divide it<br>into parts. And as it was being divided into parts, the nurse began to<br>take them up and put them one by one into those pots filled with<br>clarified butter. While this process was going on, the beautiful and<br>chaste Gandhari of rigid vows, realising the affection that one feeleth<br>for a daughter, began to think within herself, 'There is no doubt that I<br>shall have a hundred sons, the Muni having said so. It can never be<br>otherwise. But I should be very happy if a daughter were born of me over<br>and above these hundred sons and junior to them all. My husband then may<br>attain to those worlds that the possession of a daughter's sons<br>conferreth. Then again, the affection the women feel for their<br>sons-in-law is great. If, therefore, I obtain a daughter over and above<br>my hundred sons, then, surrounded by sons and daughter's sons, I may feel<br>supremely blest. If I have ever practised ascetic austerities, if I have<br>ever given anything in charity, if I have ever performed the homa<br>(through Brahamanas), if I have ever gratified my superiors by respectful<br>attentions, then (as the fruit of those acts) let a daughter be born unto<br>me.' All this while that illustrious and best of Rishis,<br>Krishna-Dwaipayana himself was dividing the ball of flesh; and counting a<br>full hundred of the parts, he said unto the daughter of Suvala, 'Here are<br>thy hundred sons. I did not speak aught unto thee that was false. Here,<br>however, is one part in excess of the hundred, intended for giving thee a<br>daughter's son. This part shall develop into an amiable and fortunate<br>daughter, as thou hast desired' Then that great ascetic brought another<br>pot full of clarified butter, and put the part intended for a daughter<br>into it.<br><br>"Thus have I, O Bharata, narrated unto thee all about the birth of<br>Duhsala. Tell me, O sinless one, what more I am now to narrate.'"
