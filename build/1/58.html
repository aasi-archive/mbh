                            (Astika Parva, continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Listen now to another very wonderful incident in connection<br>with Astika. When king Janamejaya was about to gratify Astika by granting<br>the boon, the snake (Takshaka), thrown off Indra's hands, remained in mid<br>air without actually falling. King Janamejaya thereupon became curious,<br>for Takshaka, afflicted with fear, did not at once fall into the fire<br>although libations were poured in proper form into the blazing<br>sacrificial Agni in his name.'<br><br>"Saunaka said, 'Was it, O Suta, that the mantras of those wise Brahmanas<br>were not potent; since Takshaka did not fall into the fire?'<br><br>"Sauti replied, 'Unto the unconscious Takshaka, that best of snakes,<br>after he had been cast off Indra's hands, Astika had thrice said, 'Stay,'<br>'Stay,' 'Stay.' And he succeeded in staying in the skies, with afflicted<br>heart, like a person somehow staying between the welkin and the earth.<br><br>"The king then, on being repeatedly urged by his Sadasyas, said, 'Let it<br>be done as Astika hath said. Let the sacrifice be ended, let the snakes<br>be safe, let this Astika also be gratified, O Suta, thy words also be<br>true.' When the boon was granted to Astika, plaudits expressive of joy<br>rang through the air. Thus the sacrifice of the son of Parikshit&#8212;that<br>king of the Pandava race&#8212;came to an end. The king Janamejaya of the<br>Bharata race was himself pleased, and on the Ritwiks with the Sadasyas,<br>and on all who had come there, the king, bestowed money by hundreds and<br>thousands. And unto Suta Lohitaksha&#8212;conversant with the rules of<br>building and foundations&#8212;who had at the commencement said that a<br>Brahmana would be the cause of the interruption of the snake-sacrifice,<br>the king gave much wealth. The king, of uncommon kindness, also gave him<br>various things, with food and wearing apparel, according to his desire,<br>and became very much pleased. Then he concluded his sacrifice according<br>to the prescribed rites, and after treating him with every respect, the<br>king in joy sent home the wise Astika exceedingly gratified, for he had<br>attained his object. And the king said unto him, 'Thou must come again to<br>become a Sadasya in my great Horse-sacrifice.' And Astika said, 'yes' and<br>then returned home in great joy, having achieved his great end after<br>gratifying the monarch. And returning in joy to his uncle and mother and<br>touching their feet, he recounted to them everything as it had happened.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Hearing all he had said, the snakes that had come<br>thither became very much delighted, and their fears were allayed. They<br>were much pleased with Astika and asked him to solicit a boon, saying, 'O<br>learned one, what good shall we do unto thee? We have been very much<br>gratified, having been all saved by thee. What shall we accomplish for<br>thee, O child!'<br><br>"Astika said, 'Let those Brahmanas, and other men, who shall, in the<br>morning or in the evening, cheerfully and with attention, read the sacred<br>account of this my act, have no fear from any of you.' And the snakes in<br>joy thereupon said, 'O nephew, in the nature of thy boon, let it be<br>exactly as thou sayest. That which thou askest we all shall cheerfully<br>do, O nephew! And those also that call to mind Astika, Artiman and<br>Sunitha, in the day or in the night, shall have no fear of snakes. He<br>again shall have no fear of snakes who will say, 'I call to mind the<br>famous Astika born of Jaratkaru, that Astika who saved the snakes from<br>the snake-sacrifice. Therefore, ye snakes of great good fortune, it<br>behoveth you not to bite me. But go ye away, blessed be ye, or go away<br>thou snake of virulent poison, and remember the words of Astika after the<br>snake sacrifice of Janamejaya. That snake who does not cease from biting<br>after hearing such mention of Astika, shall have his hood divided a<br>hundredfold like the fruit of Sinsa tree.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'That first of Brahmanas, thus addressed by the<br>foremost of the chief snakes assembled together, was very much gratified.<br>And the high-souled one then set his heart upon going away.<br><br>"And that best of Brahmanas, having saved the snakes from the<br>snake-sacrifice, ascended to heaven when his time came, leaving sons and<br>grandsons behind him.<br><br>'Thus have I recited to thee this history of Astika exactly as it<br>happened. Indeed, the recitation of this history dispelleth all fear of<br>snakes'<br><br>'Sauti continued, 'O Brahmanas, O foremost one of Bhrigu's race, as thy<br>ancestor Pramati had cheerfully narrated unto his inquiring son Ruru, and<br>as I had heard it, thus have I recited this blessed history, from the<br>beginning, of the learned Astika. And, O Brahmana, O oppressor of all<br>enemies, having heard this holy history of Astika that increaseth virtue,<br>and which thou hadst asked me about after hearing the story of the<br>Dundubha, let thy ardent curiosity be satisfied.'"
