                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'The maiden then, hearing those soft and sweet words<br>of the smiling monarch, and remembering her promise to the Vasus,<br>addressed the king in reply. Of faultless features, the damsel sending a<br>thrill of pleasure into the heart by every word she uttered, said, 'O<br>king, I shall become thy wife and obey thy commands. But, O monarch, thou<br>must not interfere with me in anything I do, be it agreeable or<br>disagreeable. Nor shall thou ever address me unkindly. As long as thou<br>shalt behave kindly I promise to live with thee. But I shall certainly<br>leave thee the moment thou interferest with me or speakest to me an<br>unkind word.' The king answered, 'Be it so.' And thereupon the damsel<br>obtaining that excellent monarch, that foremost one of the Bharata race<br>for her husband, became highly pleased. And king Santanu also, obtaining<br>her for his wife, enjoyed to the full the pleasure of her company. And<br>adhering to his promise, he refrained from asking her anything. And the<br>lord of earth, Santanu, became exceedingly gratified with her conduct,<br>beauty, magnanimity, and attention to his comforts. And the goddess Ganga<br>also, of three courses (celestial, terrestrial, and subterranean)<br>assuming a human form of superior complexion and endued with celestial<br>beauty, lived happily as the wife of Santanu, having as the fruit of her<br>virtuous acts, obtained for her husband, that tiger among kings equal<br>unto Indra himself in splendour. And she gratified the king by her<br>attractiveness and affection, by her wiles and love, by her music and<br>dance, and became herself gratified. And the monarch was so enraptured<br>with his beautiful wife that months, seasons, and years rolled on without<br>his being conscious of them. And the king, while thus enjoying himself<br>with his wife, had eight children born unto him who in beauty were like<br>the very celestials themselves. But, O Bharata, those children, one after<br>another, as soon as they were born, were thrown into the river by Ganga<br>who said, 'This is for thy good.' And the children sank to rise no more.<br>The king, however, could not be pleased with such conduct. But he spoke<br>not a word about it lest his wife should leave him. But when the eighth<br>child was born, and when his wife as before was about to throw it<br>smilingly into the river, the king with a sorrowful countenance and<br>desirous of saving it from destruction, addressed her and said, 'Kill it<br>not! Who art thou and whose? Why dost thou kill thy own children?<br>Murderess of thy sons, the load of thy sins is great!'" His wife, thus<br>addressed, replied, 'O thou desirous of offspring, thou hast already<br>become the first of those that have children. I shall not destroy this<br>child of thine. But according to our agreement, the period of my stay<br>with thee is at an end. I am Ganga, the daughter of Jahnu. I am ever<br>worshipped by the great sages; I have lived with thee so long for<br>accomplishing the purposes of the celestials. The eight illustrious Vasus<br>endued with great energy had, from Vasishtha's curse, to assume human<br>forms. On earth, besides thee, there was none else to deserve the honour<br>of being their begetter. There is no woman also on earth except one like<br>me, a celestial of human form, to become their mother. I assumed a human<br>form to bring them forth. Thou also, having become the father of the<br>eight Vasus, hast acquired many regions of perennial bliss. It was also<br>agreed between myself and the Vasus that I should free them from their<br>human forms as soon as they would be born. I have thus freed them from<br>the curse of the Rishi Apava. Blest be thou; I leave thee, O king! But<br>rear thou this child of rigid vows. That I should live with thee so long<br>was the promise I gave to the Vasus. And let this child be called<br>Gangadatta.'"
