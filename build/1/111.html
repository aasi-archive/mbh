                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'There was amongst the Yadavas a chief named<br>Sura. He was the father of Vasudeva. And he had a daughter called Pritha,<br>who was unrivalled for beauty on earth. And, O thou of Bharata's race,<br>Sura, always truthful in speech, gave from friendship this his firstborn<br>daughter unto his childless cousin and friend, the illustrious<br>Kuntibhoja&#8212;the son of his paternal aunt&#8212;pursuant to a former promise.<br>And Pritha in the house of her adoptive father was engaged in looking<br>after the duties of hospitality to Brahmanas and other guests. Once she<br>gratified by her attentions the terrible Brahmana of rigid vows, who was<br>known by the name of Durvasa and was well-acquainted with the hidden<br>truths of morality. Gratified with her respectful attentions, the sage,<br>anticipating by his spiritual power the future (season of) distress<br>(consequent upon the curse to be pronounced upon Pandu for his<br>unrighteous act of slaying a deer while serving its mate) imparted to her<br>a formula of invocation for summoning any of the celestials she liked to<br>give her children. And the Rishi said, 'Those celestials that thou shall<br>summon by this Mantra shall certainly approach thee and give thee<br>children.' 'Thus addressed by the Brahmana, the amiable Kunti (Pritha)<br>became curious, and in her maidenhood summoned the god Arka (Sun). And as<br>soon as he pronounced the Mantra, she beheld that effulgent deity&#8212;that<br>beholder of everything in the world&#8212;approaching her. And beholding that<br>extraordinary sight, the maiden of faultless features was overcome with<br>surprise. But the god Vivaswat (Sun) approaching her, said, 'Here I am, O<br>black-eyed girl! Tell me what I am to do for thee.'<br><br>"Hearing this, Kunti said, 'O slayer of foes, a certain Brahamana gave me<br>this formula of invocation as a boon, and, O lord, I have summoned thee<br>only to test its efficacy. For this offence I bow to thee. A woman,<br>whatever be her offence, always deserveth pardon.' Surya (Sun) replied,<br>'I know that Durvasa hath granted this boon. But cast off thy fears,<br>timid maiden, and grant me thy embraces. Amiable one, my approach cannot<br>be futile; it must bear fruit. Thou hast summoned me, and if it be for<br>nothing, it shall certainly be regarded as thy transgression.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Vivaswat thus spoke unto her many things with a<br>view to allay her fears, but, O Bharata, the amiable maiden, from modesty<br>and fear of her relatives, consented not to grant his request. And, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, Arka addressed her again and said, 'O princess,<br>for my sake, it shall not be sinful for thee to grant my wish.' Thus<br>speaking unto the daughter of Kuntibhoja, the illustrious Tapana&#8212;the<br>illuminator of the universe&#8212;gratified his wish. And of this connection<br>there was immediately born a son known all over the world as Karna<br>accountred with natural armour and with face brightened by ear-rings. And<br>the heroic Karna was the first of all wielders of weapons, blessed with<br>good fortune, and endued with the beauty of a celestial child. And after<br>the birth of this child, the illustrious Tapana granted unto Pritha her<br>maidenhood and ascended to heaven. And the princess of the Vrishni race<br>beholding with sorrow that son born of her, reflected intently upon what<br>was then the best for her to do. And from fear of her relatives she<br>resolved to conceal that evidence of her folly. And she cast her<br>offspring endued with great physical strength into the water. Then the<br>well-known husband of Radha, of the Suta caste, took up the child thus<br>cast into the water, and he and his wife brought him up as their own son.<br>And Radha and her husband bestowed on him the name of Vasusena (born with<br>wealth) because he was born with a natural armour and ear-rings. And<br>endued as he was born with great strength, as he grew up, he became<br>skilled in all weapons. Possessed of great energy, he used to adore the<br>sun until his back was heated by his rays (i.e., from dawn to midday),<br>and during the hours of worship, there was nothing on earth that the<br>heroic and intelligent Vasusena would not give unto the Brahmanas. And<br>Indra desirous of benefiting his own son Phalguni (Arjuna), assuming the<br>form of a Brahmana, approached Vasusena on one occasion and begged of him<br>his natural armour. Thus asked Karna took off his natural armour, and<br>joining his hands in reverence gave it unto Indra in the guise of a<br>Brahmana. And the chief of the celestials accepted the gift and was<br>exceedingly gratified with Karna's liberality. He therefore, gave unto<br>him a fine dart, saying, 'That one (and one only) among the celestials,<br>the Asuras, men, the Gandharvas, the Nagas, and the Rakshasas, whom thou<br>desirest to conquer, shall be certainly slain with this dart.'<br><br>"The son of Surya was before this known by the name of Vasusena. But<br>since he cut off his natural armour, he came to be called Karna (the<br>cutter or peeler of his own cover).'"
