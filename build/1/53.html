                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Saunaka asked, 'What great Rishis became the Ritwiks at the<br>snake-sacrifice of the wise king Janamejaya of the Pandava line? Who also<br>became the Sadasyas in that terrible snake-sacrifice, so frightful to the<br>snakes, and begetting such sorrow in them? It behoveth thee to describe<br>all these in detail, so that, O son of Suta, we may know who were<br>acquainted with the rituals of the snake-sacrifice.'<br><br>"Sauti replied, 'I will recite the names of those wise ones who became<br>the monarch's Ritwiks and Sadasyas. The Brahmana Chandabhargava became<br>the Hotri in that sacrifice. He was of great reputation, and was born in<br>the race of Chyavana and was the foremost of those acquainted with the<br>Vedas. The learned old Brahmana, Kautsa, became the Udgatri, the chanter<br>of the Vedic hymns. Jaimini became the Brahmana, and Sarngarva and<br>Pingala the Adhvaryus, Vyasa with his son and disciples, and Uddalaka,<br>Pramataka, Swetaketu, Pingala, Asita, Devala, Narada, Parvata, Atreya,<br>Kundajathara, the Brahmana Kalaghata, Vatsya, old Srutasravas ever<br>engaged in japa and the study of the Vedas. Kohala Devasarman, Maudgalya,<br>Samasaurava, and many other Brahmanas who had got through the Vedas<br>became the Sadasyas at that sacrifice of the son of Parikshit.<br><br>"When the Ritwiks in that snake-sacrifice began to pour clarified butter<br>into the fire, terrible snakes, striking fear into every creature, began<br>to fall into it. And the fat and the marrow of the snakes thus falling<br>into the fire began to flow in rivers. And the atmosphere was filled with<br>an insufferable stench owing to the incessant burning of the snakes. And<br>incessant also were the cries of the snakes fallen into the fire and<br>those in the air about to fall into it.<br><br>'Meanwhile, Takshaka, that prince of snakes, as soon as he heard that<br>king Janamejaya was engaged in the sacrifice, went to the palace of<br>Purandara (Indra). And that best of snakes, having represented all that<br>had taken place, sought in terror the protection of Indra after having<br>acknowledged his fault. And Indra, gratified, told him, 'O prince of<br>snakes, O Takshaka, here thou hast no fear from that snake-sacrifice. The<br>Grandsire was pacified by me for thy sake. Therefore, thou hast no fear.<br>Let this fear of thy heart be allayed.'<br><br>Sauti continued, 'Thus encouraged by him, that best of snakes began to<br>dwell in Indra's abode in joy and happiness. But Vasuki, seeing that the<br>snakes were incessantly falling into the fire and that his family was<br>reduced to only a few, became exceedingly sorry. And the king of the<br>snakes was afflicted with great grief, and his heart was about to break.<br>And summoning his sister, he spake unto her, saying, 'O amiable one, my<br>limbs are burning and I no longer see the points of the heavens. I am<br>about to fall down from loss of consciousness. My mind is turning, my<br>sight is falling and my heart is breaking. Benumbed, I may fall today<br>into that blazing fire! This sacrifice of the son of Parikshit is for the<br>extermination of our race. It is evident I also shall have to go to the<br>abode of the king of the dead. The time is come, O my sister, on account<br>of which thou wert bestowed by me on Jaratkaru to protect us with our<br>relatives. O best of the women of the snake race, Astika will put an end<br>to the sacrifice that is going on. The Grandsire told me this of old.<br>Therefore, O child, solicit thy dear son who is fully conversant with the<br>Vedas and regarded even by the old, for the protection of myself and also<br>of those dependent on me."'
