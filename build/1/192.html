                            (Swayamvara Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then those bulls among Brahmanas shaking their<br>deer-skins and water-pots made of cocoanut-shells exclaimed, 'Fear not,<br>we will fight the foe!' Arjuna smilingly addressing those Brahmanas<br>exclaiming thus, said, 'Stand ye aside as spectators (of the fray)<br>Showering hundreds of arrows furnished with straight points even I shall<br>check, like snakes with mantras, all those angry monarchs.' Having said<br>this, the mighty Arjuna taking up the bow he had obtained as dower<br>accompanied by his brother Bhima stood immovable as a mountain. And<br>beholding those Kshatriyas who were ever furious in battle with Karna<br>ahead, the heroic brothers rushed fearlessly at them like two elephants<br>rushing against a hostile elephant. Then those monarchs eager for the<br>fight fiercely exclaimed, 'The slaughter in battle of one desiring to<br>fight is permitted.' And saying this, the monarchs suddenly rushed<br>against the Brahmanas. And Karna endued with great energy rushed against<br>Jishnu for fight. And Salya the mighty king of Madra rushed against Bhima<br>like an elephant rushing against another for the sake of a she-elephant<br>in heat; while Duryodhana and others engaged with the Brahmanas,<br>skirmished with them lightly and carelessly. Then the illustrious Arjuna<br>beholding Karna, the son of Vikartana (Surya), advancing towards him,<br>drew his tough bow and pieced him with his sharp arrows. And the impetus<br>of those whetted arrows furnished with fierce energy made Radheya (Karna)<br>faint. Recovering consciousness Karna attacked Arjuna with greater care<br>than before. Then Karna and Arjuna, both foremost of victorious warriors,<br>desirous of vanquishing each other, fought madly on. And such was the<br>lightness of hand they both displayed that (each enveloped by the other's<br>shower of arrows) they both became invisible (unto the spectators of<br>their encounter). 'Behold the strength of my arms.'&#8212;'Mark, how I have<br>counteracted that feat,'&#8212;those were the words&#8212;intelligible to heroes<br>alone&#8212;in which they addressed each other. And incensed at finding the<br>strength and energy of Arjuna's arms unequalled on the earth, Karna, the<br>son of Surya, fought with greater vigour. And parrying all those<br>impetuous arrows shot at him by Arjuna, Karna sent up a loud shout. And<br>this feat of his was applauded by all the warriors. Then addressing his<br>antagonist, Karna said, 'O thou foremost of Brahmanas, I am gratified to<br>observe the energy of thy arms that knoweth no relaxation in battle and<br>thy weapons themselves fit for achieving victory. Art thou the embodiment<br>of the science of weapons, or art thou Rama that best of Brahmanas, or<br>Indra himself, or Indra's younger brother Vishnu called also Achyuta, who<br>for disguising himself hath assumed the form of a Brahmana and mustering<br>such energy of arms fighteth with me? No other person except the husband<br>himself of Sachi or Kiriti, the son of Pandu, is capable of fighting with<br>me when I am angry on the field of battle.' Then hearing those words of<br>his, Phalguna replied, saying, 'O Karna, I am neither the science of arms<br>(personified), nor Rama endued with superhuman powers. I am only a<br>Brahmana who is the foremost of all warriors and all wielders of weapons.<br>By the grace of my preceptor I have become accomplished in the Brahma and<br>the Paurandara weapons. I am here to vanquish thee in battle. Therefore,<br>O hero, wait a little.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed (by Arjuna), Karna the adopted<br>son of Radha desisted from the fight, for that mighty chariot-fighter<br>thought that Brahma energy is ever invincible. Meanwhile on another part<br>of the field, the mighty heroes Salya and Vrikodara, well-skilled in<br>battle and possessed of great strength and proficiency, challenging each<br>other, engaged in fight like two elephants in rut. And they struck each<br>other with their clenched fists and knees. And sometimes pushing each<br>other forward and sometimes dragging each other near, sometimes throwing<br>each other down; face downward, and sometimes on the sides, they fought<br>on, striking, each other at times with their clenched fists. And<br>encountering each other with blows hard as the clash of two masses of<br>granite, the lists rang with the sounds of their combat. Fighting with<br>each other thus for a few seconds, Bhima the foremost of the Kuru heroes<br>taking up Salya on his arms hurled him to a distance. And Bhimasena, that<br>bull amongst men, surprised all (by the dexterity of his feat) for though<br>he threw Salya on the ground he did it without hurting him much. And when<br>Salya was thus thrown down and Karna was struck with fear, the other<br>monarchs were all alarmed. And they hastily surrounded Bhima and<br>exclaimed, 'Surely these bulls amongst Brahmanas are excellent<br>(warriors)! Ascertain in what race they have been born and where they<br>abide. Who can encounter Karna, the son of Radha, in fight, except Rama<br>or Drona, or Kiriti, the son of Pandu? Who also can encounter Duryodhana<br>in battle except Krishna, the son of Devaki, and Kripa, the son of<br>Saradwan? Who also can overthrow in battle Salya, that first of mighty<br>warriors, except the hero Valadeva or Vrikodara, the son of Pandu, or the<br>heroic Duryodhana? Let us, therefore, desist from this fight with the<br>Brahmanas. Indeed, Brahmanas, however offending, should yet be ever<br>protected. And first let us ascertain who these are; for after we have<br>done that we may cheerfully fight with them.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'And Krishna, having beheld that feat of Bhima,<br>believed them both to be the son of Kunti. And gently addressing the<br>assembled monarchs, saying, 'This maiden hath been justly acquired (by<br>the Brahmana),' he induced them to abandon the fight. Accomplished in<br>battle, those monarchs then desisted from the fight. And those best of<br>monarchs then returned to their respective kingdoms, wondering much. And<br>those who had come there went away saying. 'The festive scene hath<br>terminated in the victory of the Brahmanas. The princess of Panchala hath<br>become the bride of a Brahmana.' And surrounded by Brahmanas dressed in<br>skins of deer and other wild animals, Bhima and Dhananjaya passed with<br>difficulty out of the throng. And those heroes among men, mangled by the<br>enemy and followed by Krishna, on coming at last out of that throng,<br>looked like the full moon and the sun emerging from the clouds.<br><br>"Meanwhile Kunti seeing that her sons were late in returning from their<br>eleemosynary round, was filled with anxiety. She began to think of<br>various evils having overtaken her sons. At one time she thought that the<br>sons of Dhritarashtra having recognised her sons had slain them. Next she<br>feared that some cruel and strong Rakshasas endued with powers of<br>deception had slain them. And she asked herself, 'Could the illustrious<br>Vyasa himself (who had directed my sons to come to Panchala) have been<br>guided by perverse intelligence?' Thus reflected Pritha in consequence of<br>her affection for her offspring. Then in the stillness of the late<br>afternoon, Jishnu, accompanied by a body of Brahmanas, entered the abode<br>of the potter, like the cloud-covered sun appearing on a cloudy day.'"
