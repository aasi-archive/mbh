                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'The dwellers in heaven became exceedingly glad in<br>welcoming Kacha who had mastered the wonderful science. And, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, the celestials then learnt that science from Kacha and<br>considered their object already achieved. And assembling together, they<br>spoke unto him of a hundred sacrifices, saying, 'The time hath come for<br>showing prowess. Slay thy foes, O Purandara!' And thus addressed,<br>Maghavat, then accompanied by the celestials, set out, saying, 'So be<br>it.' But on his way he saw a number of damsels. These maidens were<br>sporting in a lake in the gardens of the Gandharva Chitraratha. Changing<br>himself into wind, he soon mixed up the garments of those maidens which<br>they had laid on the bank. A little while after, the maidens, getting up<br>from the water, approached their garments that had, indeed, got mixed up<br>with one another. And it so happened that from the intermingled heap, the<br>garments of Devayani were appropriated by Sarmishtha, the daughter of<br>Vrishaparvan, from ignorance that it was not hers. And, O king,<br>thereupon, between them, Devayani and Sarmishtha, then ensued a dispute.<br>And Devayani said, 'O daughter of the Asura (chief), why dost thou take<br>my attire, being, as thou art, my disciple? As thou art destitute of good<br>behaviour, nothing good can happen to thee!' Sarmishtha, however, quickly<br>replied, 'Thy father occupying a lower seat, always adoreth with downcast<br>looks, like a hired chanter of praises, my father, whether he sitteth at<br>his ease or reclineth at full length! Thou art the daughter of one that<br>chanteth the praises of others, of one that accepteth alms. I am the<br>daughter of one who is adored, of one who bestoweth alms instead of ever<br>accepting them! Beggar-woman as thou art, thou art free to strike thy<br>breast, to use ill words, to vow enmity to me, to give way to thy wrath.<br>Acceptress of alms, thou weepest tears of anger in vain! If so minded, I<br>can harm thee, but thou canst not. Thou desirest to quarrel. But know<br>thou that I do not reckon thee as my equal!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words, Devayani became<br>exceedingly angry and began to pull at her clothes. Sarmishtha thereupon<br>threw her into a well and went home. Indeed, the wicked Sarmishtha<br>believing that Devayani was dead, bent her steps home-wards in a wrathful<br>mood.<br><br>"After Sarmishtha had left, Yayati the son of Nahusha soon came to that<br>spot. The king had been out a-hunting. The couple of horses harnessed to<br>his car and the other single horse with him were all fatigued. And the<br>king himself was thirsty. And the son of Nahusha saw a well that was by.<br>And he saw that it was dry. But in looking down into it, he saw a maiden<br>who in splendour was like a blazing fire. And beholding her within it,<br>the blessed king addressed that girl of the complexion of the celestials,<br>soothing her with sweet words. And he said, 'Who art thou, O fair one, of<br>nails bright as burnished copper, and with ear-rings decked with<br>celestial gems? Thou seemest to be greatly perturbed. Why dost thou weep<br>in affliction? How, indeed, hast thou fallen into this well covered with<br>creepers and long grass? And, O slender-waisted girl, answer me truly<br>whose daughter thou art.<br><br>"Devayani then replied, 'I am the daughter of Sukra who brings back into<br>life the Asuras slain by the gods. He doth not know what hath befallen<br>me. This is my right hand, O king, with nails bright as burnished copper.<br>Thou art well-born; I ask thee, to take and raise me up! I know thou art<br>of good behaviour, of great prowess, and of wide fame! It behoveth thee,<br>therefore, to raise me from this well.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'King Yayati, learning that she was a Brahmana's<br>daughter, raised her from that well by catching hold of her right hand.<br>And the monarch promptly raising her from the pit and squinting to her<br>tapering thighs, sweetly and courteously returned to his capital.<br><br>"When the son of Nahusha had gone away, Devayani of faultless features,<br>afflicted with grief, then spoke unto her maid, Ghurnika by name, who met<br>her then. And she said, 'O Ghurnika, go thou quickly and speak to my<br>father without loss of time of everything as it hath happened. I shall<br>not now enter the city of Vrishaparvan.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Ghurnika, thus commanded, repaired quickly to<br>the mansion, of the Asura chief, where she saw Kavya and spoke unto him<br>with her perception dimmed by anger. And she said, 'I tell thee, O great<br>Brahmana, that Devayani hath been ill-used, O fortunate one, in the<br>forest by Sarmishtha, the daughter of Vrishaparvan.' And Kavya, hearing<br>that his daughter had been ill-used by Sarmishtha speedily went out with<br>a heavy heart, seeking her in the woods. And when he found her in the<br>woods, he clasped her with affection and spoke unto her with voice choked<br>with grief, 'O daughter, the weal or woe that befalleth people is always<br>due to their own faults. Thou hast therefore some fault, I ween, which<br>hath been expiated thus.' Hearing this Devayani replied, 'Be it a penalty<br>or not, listen to me with attention. O, hear that all Sarmishtha, the<br>daughter of Vrishaparvan, hath said unto me. Really hath she said that<br>thou art only the hired chanter of the praises of the Asura king! Even<br>thus hath she&#8212;that Sarmishtha, Vrishaparvan's daughter,&#8212;spoken to me,<br>with reddened eyes, these piercing and cruel words, 'Thou art the<br>daughter of one that ever chanteth for hire the praises of others, of one<br>that asketh for charities, of one that accepteth alms; whereas I am the<br>daughter of one that receiveth adorations, of one that giveth, of one<br>that never accepteth anything as gift!' These have been the words<br>repeatedly spoken unto me by the proud Sarmishtha, the daughter of<br>Vrishaparvan, with eyes red with anger. If, O father, I am really the<br>daughter of a hired chanter of praises, of one that accepteth gifts, I<br>must offer my adorations in the hope of obtaining her grace! Oh, of this<br>I have already told her!'<br><br>"Sukra replied, 'Thou art, O Devayani, no daughter of a hired adorer, of<br>one that asketh for alms and accepteth gifts. Thou art the daughter of<br>one that adores none, but of one that is adored by all! Vrishaparvan<br>himself knoweth it, and Indra, and king Yayati too. That inconceivable<br>Brahma, that unopposable Godhead, is my strength! The self-create,<br>himself, gratified by me, hath said that I am for aye the lord of that<br>which is in all things on Earth or in Heaven! I tell thee truly that it<br>is I who pour rain for the good of creatures and who nourish the annual<br>plants that sustain all living things!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'It was by such sweet words of excellent import<br>that the father endeavoured to pacify his daughter afflicted with woe and<br>oppressed by anger.'"
