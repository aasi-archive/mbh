                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Meanwhile the great ascetic Jaratkaru wandered over the whole earth<br>making the place where evening fell his home for the night. And gifted<br>with ascetic power, he roamed, practising various vows difficult to be<br>practised by the immature, and bathing also in various sacred waters. And<br>the Muni had air alone for his food and was free from desire of worldly<br>enjoyment. And he became daily emaciated and grew lean-fleshed. And one<br>day he saw the spirits of his ancestors, heads down, in a hole, by a cord<br>of virana roots having only one thread entire. And that even single<br>thread was being gradually eaten away by a large rat dwelling in that<br>hole. And the Pitris in that hole were without food, emaciated, pitiable,<br>and eagerly desirous of salvation. And Jaratkaru, approaching the<br>pitiable one, himself in humble guise, asked them, 'Who are ye hanging by<br>this cord of virana roots? The single weak root that is still left in<br>this cord of virana roots already eaten away by the rat, dwelling in this<br>hole, is itself being gradually eaten away by the same rat with his sharp<br>teeth. The little that remains of that single thread will soon be cut<br>away. It is clear ye shall then have to fall down into this pit with<br>faces downwards. Seeing you with faces downwards, and overtaken by this<br>great calamity, my pity hath been excited. What good can I do to you.<br>Tell me quickly whether this calamity can be averted by a fourth, a<br>third, or even by the sacrifice of a half of this my asceticism, O,<br>relieve yourselves even with the whole of my asceticism. I consent to all<br>this. Do ye as ye please.'<br><br>"The Pitris said, 'Venerable Brahmacharin, thou desirest to relieve us.<br>But, O foremost of Brahmanas, thou canst not dispel our affliction by thy<br>asceticism. O child, O first of speakers, we too have the fruits of our<br>asceticism. But, O Brahmana, it is for the loss of children that we are<br>falling down into this unholy hell. The grandsire himself hath said that<br>a son is a great merit. As we are about to be cast in this hole, our<br>ideas are no longer clear. Therefore, O child, we know thee not, although<br>thy manhood is well-known on earth. Venerable thou art and of good<br>fortune, thou who thus from kindness grievest for us worthy of pity and<br>greatly afflicted. O Brahmana, listen, who we are. We are Rishis of the<br>Yayavara sect, of rigid vows. And, O Muni, from loss of children, we have<br>fallen down from a sacred region. Our severe penances have not been<br>destroyed; we have a thread yet. But we have only one thread now. It<br>matters little, however, whether he is or is not. Unfortunate as we are,<br>we have a thread in one, known as Jaratkaru. The unfortunate one has gone<br>through the Vedas and their branches and is practising asceticism alone.<br>He being one with soul under complete control, desires set high,<br>observant of vows, deeply engaged in ascetic penances, and free from<br>greed for the merits or asceticism, we have been reduced to this<br>deplorable state. He hath no wife, no son, no relatives. Therefore, do we<br>hang in this hole, our consciousness lost, like men having none to take<br>care of them. If thou meetest him, O, tell him, from thy kindness to<br>ourselves, Thy Pitris, in sorrow, are hanging with faces downwards in a<br>hole. Holy one, take a wife and beget children. O thou of ascetic wealth,<br>thou art, O amiable one, the only thread that remaineth in the line of<br>thy ancestors. O Brahmana, the cord of virana roots that thou seest we<br>are hanging by, is the cord representing our multiplied race. And, O<br>Brahmana, these threads of the cord of virana roots that thou seest as<br>eaten away, are ourselves who have been eaten up by Time. This root thou<br>seest hath been half-eaten and by which we are hanging in this hole is he<br>that hath adopted asceticism alone. The rat that thou beholdest is Time<br>of infinite strength. And he (Time) is gradually weakening the wretch<br>Jaratkaru engaged in ascetic penances tempted by the merits thereof, but<br>wanting in prudence and heart. O excellent one, his asceticism cannot<br>save us. Behold, our roots being torn, cast down from higher regions,<br>deprived of consciousness by Time, we are going downwards like sinful<br>wretches. And upon our going down into this hole with all our relatives,<br>eaten up by Time, even he shall sink with us into hell. O child, whether<br>it is asceticism, or sacrifice, or whatever else there be of very holy<br>acts, everything is inferior. These cannot count with a son. O child,<br>having seen all, speak unto that Jaratkaru of ascetic wealth. Thou<br>shouldst tell him in detail everything that thou hast beheld. And, O<br>Brahmana, from thy kindness towards us, thou shouldst tell him all that<br>would induce him to take a wife and beget children. Amongst his friends,<br>or of our own race, who art thou, O excellent one, that thus grievest for<br>us all like a friend? We wish to hear who thou art that stayest here.'"
