                            (Astika Parva)<br><br>"Saunaka said, 'For what reason did that tiger among kings, the royal<br>Janamejaya, determine to take the lives of the snakes by means of a<br>sacrifice? O Sauti, tell us in full the true story. Tell us also why<br>Astika, that best of regenerate ones, that foremost of ascetics, rescued<br>the snakes from the blazing fire. Whose son was that monarch who<br>celebrated the snake-sacrifice? And whose son also was that best of<br>regenerate ones?'<br><br>"Sauti said, 'O best of speakers, this story of Astika is long. I will<br>duly relate it in full, O listen!'<br><br>"Saunaka said, 'I am desirous of hearing at length the charming story of<br>that Rishi, that illustrious Brahmana named Astika.'<br><br>"Sauti said, 'This history (first) recited by Krishna-Dwaipayana, is<br>called a Purana by the Brahmanas. It was formerly narrated by my wise<br>father, Lomaharshana, the disciple of Vyasa, before the dwellers of the<br>Naimisha forest, at their request. I was present at the recital, and, O<br>Saunaka, since thou askest me, I shall narrate the history of Astika<br>exactly as I heard it. O listen, as I recite in full that sin-destroying<br>story.<br><br>"The father of Astika was powerful like Prajapati. He was a<br>Brahma-charin, always engaged in austere devotions. He ate sparingly, was<br>a great ascetic, and had his lust under complete control. And he was<br>known by the name of Jaratkaru. That foremost one among the Yayavaras,<br>virtuous and of rigid vows, highly blessed and endued with great ascetic<br>power, once undertook a journey over the world. He visited diverse<br>places, bathed in diverse sacred waters, and rested where night overtook<br>him. Endued with great energy, he practised religious austerities, hard<br>to be practised by men of unrestrained souls. The sage lived upon air<br>only, and renounced sleep for ever. Thus going about like a blazing fire,<br>one day he happened to see his ancestors, hanging heads down in a great<br>hole, their feet pointing upwards. On seeing them, Jaratkaru addressed<br>them, saying:<br><br>'Who are you thus hanging heads down in this hole by a rope of virana<br>fibres that is again secretly eaten into on all sides by a rat living<br>here?'<br><br>"The ancestors said, 'We are Rishis of rigid vows, called Yayavaras. We<br>are sinking low into the earth for want of offspring. We have a son named<br>Jaratkaru. Woe to us! That wretch hath entered upon a life of austerities<br>only! The fool doth not think of raising offspring by marriage! It is for<br>that reason, viz., the fear of extinction of our race, that we are<br>suspended in this hole. Possessed of means, we fare like unfortunates<br>that have none! O excellent one, who art thou that thus sorrowest as a<br>friend on our account? We desire to learn, O Brahmana, who thou art that<br>standest by us, and why, O best of men, thou sorrowest for us that are so<br>unfortunate.'<br><br>"Jaratkaru said, 'Ye are even my sires and grandsires I am that<br>Jaratkaru! O, tell me, how I may serve you.'<br><br>"The fathers then answered, 'Try thy best, O child, to beget a son to<br>extend our line. Thou wilt then, O excellent one, have done a meritorious<br>art for both thyself and us. Not by the fruits of virtue, not by ascetic<br>penances well hoarded up, acquireth the merit which one doth by becoming<br>a father. Therefore, O child, by our command, set thy heart upon marriage<br>and offspring. Even this is our highest good.'<br><br>"Jaratkaru replied, 'I shall not marry for my sake, nor shall I earn<br>wealth for enjoyment, but I shall do so for your welfare only. According<br>to this understanding, I shall, agreeably to the Sastric ordinance, take<br>a wife for attaining the end. I shall not act otherwise. If a bride may<br>be had of the same name with me, whose friends would, besides, willingly<br>give her to me as a gift in charity, I shall wed her duly. But who will<br>give his daughter to a poor man like me for wife. I shall, however,<br>accept any daughter given to me as alms. I shall endeavour, ye sires,<br>even thus to wed a girl! Having given my word, I will not act otherwise.<br>Upon her I will raise offspring for your redemption, so that, ye fathers,<br>ye may attain to eternal regions (of bliss) and may rejoice as ye like.'"<br><br>So ends the thirteenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.
