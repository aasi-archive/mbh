                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'There is a mountain called Mandara adorned with cloud-like<br>peaks. It is the best of mountains, and is covered all over with<br>intertwining herbs. There countless birds pour forth their melodies, and<br>beasts of prey roam about. The gods, the Apsaras and the Kinnaras visit<br>the place. Upwards it rises eleven thousand yojanas, and descends<br>downwards as much. The gods wanted to tear it up and use it as a churning<br>rod but failing to do so same to Vishnu and Brahman who were sitting<br>together, and said unto them, 'Devise some efficient scheme, consider, ye<br>gods, how Mandara may be dislodged for our good.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'O son of Bhrigu! Vishnu with Brahman assented to it.<br>And the lotus-eyed one (Vishnu) laid the hard task on the mighty Ananta,<br>the prince of snakes. The powerful Ananta, directed thereto both by<br>Brahman and Narayana, O Brahmana, tore up the mountain with the woods<br>thereon and with the denizens of those woods. And the gods came to the<br>shore of the Ocean with Ananta and addressed the Ocean, saying, 'O Ocean;<br>we have come to churn thy waters for obtaining nectar.' And the Ocean<br>replied, 'Be it so, as I shall not go without a share of it. I am able to<br>bear the prodigious agitation of my waters set up by the mountain.' The<br>gods then went to the king of tortoises and said to him, 'O<br>Tortoise-king, thou wilt have to hold the mountain on thy back!' The<br>Tortoise-king agreed, and Indra contrived to place the mountain on the<br>former's back.<br><br>"And the gods and the Asuras made of Mandara a churning staff and Vasuki<br>the cord, and set about churning the deep for amrita. The Asuras held<br>Vasuki by the hood and the gods held him by the tail. And Ananta, who was<br>on the side of the gods, at intervals raised the snake's hood and<br>suddenly lowered it. And in consequence of the stretch Vasuki received at<br>the hands of the gods and the Asuras, black vapours with flames issued<br>from his mouth. These, turned into clouds charged with lightning, poured<br>showers that refreshed the tired gods. And flowers that also fell on all<br>sides of the celestials from the trees on the whirling Mandara, refreshed<br>them.<br><br>"Then, O Brahmana, out of the deep came a tremendous roar like unto the<br>roar of the clouds at the Universal Dissolution. Diverse aquatic animals<br>being crushed by the great mountain gave up the ghost in the salt waters.<br>And many denizens of the lower regions and the world of Varuna were<br>killed. Large trees with birds on the whirling Mandara were torn up by<br>the roots and fell into the water. The mutual friction of those trees<br>also produced fires that blazed up frequently. The mountain thus looked<br>like a mass of dark clouds charged with lightning. O Brahmana, the fire<br>spread, and consumed the lions, elephants and other creatures that were<br>on the mountain. Then Indra extinguished that fire by pouring down heavy<br>showers.<br><br>"After the churning, O Brahmana, had gone on for some time, gummy<br>exudations of various trees and herbs vested with the properties of<br>amrita mingled with the waters of the Ocean. And the celestials attained<br>to immortality by drinking of the water mixed with those gums and with<br>the liquid extract of gold. By degrees, the milky water of the agitated<br>deep turned into clarified butter by virtue of those gums and juices. But<br>nectar did not appear even then. The gods came before the boon-granting<br>Brahman seated on his seat and said, 'Sire, we are spent up, we have no<br>strength left to churn further. Nectar hath not yet arisen so that now we<br>have no resource save Narayana.'<br><br>"On hearing them, Brahman said to Narayana, 'O Lord, condescend to grant<br>the gods strength to churn the deep afresh.'<br><br>"Then Narayana agreeing to grant their various prayers, said, 'Ye wise<br>ones, I grant you sufficient strength. Go, put the mountain in position<br>again and churn the water.'<br><br>'Re-established thus in strength, the gods recommenced churning. After a<br>while, the mild Moon of a thousand rays emerged from the Ocean.<br>Thereafter sprung forth Lakshmi dressed in white, then Soma, then the<br>White Steed, and then the celestial gem Kaustubha which graces the breast<br>of Narayana. Then Lakshmi, Soma and the Steed, fleet as the mind, all<br>came before the gods on high. Then arose the divine Dhanwantari himself<br>with the white vessel of nectar in his hand. And seeing him, the Asuras<br>set up a loud cry, saying, 'It be ours.'<br><br>"And at length rose the great elephant, Airavata, of huge body and with<br>two pair of white tusks. And him took Indra the wielder of the<br>thunderbolt. But with the churning still going on, the poison Kalakuta<br>appeared at last. Engulfing the Earth it suddenly blazed up like a fire<br>attended with fumes. And by the scent of the fearful Kalakuta, the three<br>worlds were stupefied. And then Siva, being solicited by Brahman,<br>swallowed that poison for the safety of the creation. The divine<br>Maheswara held it in his throat, and it is said that from that time he is<br>called Nilakantha (blue-throated). Seeing all these wondrous things, the<br>Asuras were filled with despair, and got themselves prepared for entering<br>into hostilities with the gods for the possession of Lakshmi and Amrita.<br>Thereupon Narayana called his bewitching Maya (illusive power) to his<br>aid, and assuming the form of an enticing female, coquetted with the<br>Danavas. The Danavas and the Daityas charmed with her exquisite beauty<br>and grace lost their reason and unanimously placed the Amrita in the<br>hands of that fair damsel.'"<br><br>So ends the eighteenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.
