                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'That best of snakes, viz., Vasuki, hearing the curse of his<br>mother, reflected how to render it abortive. He held a consultation with<br>all his brothers, Airavata and others, intent upon doing what they deemed<br>best for themselves.'<br><br>"And Vasuki said, 'O ye sinless ones, the object of this curse is known<br>to you. It behoveth us to strive to neutralise it. Remedies certainly<br>exist for all curses, but no remedy can avail those cursed by their<br>mother. Hearing that this curse hath been uttered in the presence of the<br>Immutable, the Infinite, and the True one, my heart trembleth. Surely,<br>our annihilation hath come. Otherwise why should not the Immutable Lord<br>prevent our mother while uttering the curse? Therefore, let us consult<br>today how we may secure the safety of the snakes. Let us not waste time.<br>All of you are wise and discerning. We will consult together and find out<br>the means of deliverance as (did) the gods of yore to regain lost Agni<br>who had concealed himself within a cave, so that Janamejaya's sacrifice<br>for the destruction of the snakes may not take place, and so that we may<br>not meet with destruction.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Thus addressed all the offspring of Kadru assembled<br>together, and, wise in counsels, submitted their opinions to one another.<br>One party of the serpents said, 'We should assume the guise of superior<br>Brahmanas, and beseech Janamejaya, saying, 'This (intended) sacrifice of<br>yours ought not to take place.' Other snakes thinking themselves wise,<br>said, 'We should all become his favourite counsellors. He will then<br>certainly ask for our advice in all projects. And we will then give him<br>such advice that the sacrifice may be obstructed. The king, the foremost<br>of wise men, thinking us of sterling worth will certainly ask us about<br>his sacrifice. We will say, 'It must not be!' And pointing to many<br>serious evils in this and the next worlds, we will take care that the<br>sacrifice may not take place. Or, let one of the snakes, approaching,<br>bite the person who, intending the monarch's good, and well-acquainted<br>with the rites of the snake-sacrifice, may be appointed as the<br>sacrificial priest, so that he will die. The sacrificial priest dying,<br>the sacrifice will not be completed. We will also bite all those who,<br>acquainted with the rites of the snake-sacrifice, may be appointed<br>Ritwiks of the sacrifice, and by that means attain our object.' Other<br>snakes, more virtuous and kind, said, 'O, this counsel of yours is evil.<br>It is not meet to kill Brahmanas. In danger, that remedy is proper, which<br>is blessed on the practices of the righteous. Unrighteousness finally<br>destroyeth the world.' Other serpents said, 'We will extinguish the<br>blazing sacrificial fire by ourselves becoming clouds luminous with<br>lightning and pouring down showers.' Other snakes, the best of their<br>kind, proposed, 'Going, by night, let us steal away the vessel of Soma<br>juice. That will disturb the rite. Or, at that sacrifice, let the snakes,<br>by hundreds and thousands, bite the people, and spread terror around. Or,<br>let the serpents defile the pure food with their food-defiling urine and<br>dung.' Others said, 'Let us become the king's Ritwiks, and obstruct his<br>sacrifice by saying at the outset, 'Give us the sacrificial fee.' He (the<br>king), being placed in our power, will do whatever we like.' Others there<br>said, 'When the king will sport in the waters, we will carry him to our<br>home and bind him, so that that sacrifice will not take place!' Other<br>serpents who deemed themselves wise, said, 'Approaching the king, let us<br>bite him, so that our object will be accomplished. By his death the root<br>of all evil will be torn up. This is the final deliberation of us all, O<br>thou who hearest with thy eyes! Then, do speedily what thou deemest<br>proper.' Having said this, they looked intently at Vasuki, that best of<br>snakes. And Vasuki also, after reflecting, answered saying, 'Ye snakes,<br>this final determination of you doth not seem worthy of adoption. The<br>advice of you all is not to my liking. What shall I say which would be<br>for your good? I think the grace of the illustrious Kasyapa (our father)<br>can alone do us good. Ye snakes, my heart doth not know which of all your<br>suggestions is to be adopted for the welfare of my race as also of me.<br>That must be done by me which would be to your weal. It is this that<br>makes me so anxious, for the credit or the discredit (of the measure) is<br>mine alone.'"<br><br>So ends the thirty-seventh section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.
