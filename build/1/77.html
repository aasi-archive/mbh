                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'After the expiry of the period of his vow, Kacha,<br>having obtained his preceptor's leave, was about to return to the abode<br>of the celestials, when Devayani, addressing him, said, 'O grandson of<br>the Rishi Angiras, in conduct and birth, in learning, asceticism and<br>humility, thou shinest most brightly. As the celebrated Rishi Angiras is<br>honoured and regarded by my father, so is thy father regarded and<br>worshipped by me. O thou of ascetic wealth, knowing this, listen to what<br>I say. Recollect my conduct towards thee during the period of thy vow<br>(Brahmacharya). Thy vow hath now been over. It behoveth thee to fix thy<br>affections on me. O accept my hand duly with ordained mantras.'<br><br>"Kacha replied, 'Thou art to me an object of regard and worship even as<br>thy father! O thou of faultless features, thou art, indeed, even an<br>object of greater reverence! Thou art dearer than life to the high-souled<br>Bhargava, O amiable one! As the daughter of my preceptor, thou art ever<br>worthy of my worship! As my preceptor Sukra, thy father, is ever<br>deserving of my regards, so art thou, O Devayani! Therefore, it behoveth<br>thee not to say so.' Hearing this, Devayani replied, 'Thou, too, art the<br>son of my father's preceptor's son. Therefore, O best of Brahmanas, thou<br>art deserving of my regards and worship. O Kacha, when thou wert slain so<br>many times by the Asuras, recollect today the affection I showed for<br>thee. Remembering my friendship and affection for thee, and, indeed, my<br>devoted regard also, O virtuous one, it behoveth thee not to abandon me<br>without any fault. I am truly devoted to thee.'<br><br>"Hearing all this, Kacha said, 'O thou of virtuous vows, do not urge me<br>into such a sinful course. O thou of fair eye-brows, be gracious unto me.<br>Beautiful one, thou art to me an object of greater regard than my<br>preceptor. Full of virtuous resolves, O large-eyed one, of face as<br>handsome, as moon, the place where thou hadst resided, viz., the body of<br>Kavya, hath also been my abode. Thou art truly my sister. Amiable one,<br>happily have we passed the days that we have been together. There is<br>perfect good understanding between us. I ask thy leave to return to my<br>abode. Therefore, bless me so that my journey may be safe. I must be<br>remembered by thee, when thou recallest me in connection with topics of<br>conversation, as one that hath not transgressed virtue. Always attend<br>upon my preceptor with readiness and singleness of heart.' To all this,<br>Devaniya answered, 'Solicited, by me, if, indeed, thou truly refusest to<br>make me thy wife, then, O Kacha, this thy knowledge shall not bear fruit.'<br><br>"Hearing this, Kacha said, 'I have refused thy request only because thou<br>art the daughter of my preceptor, and not because thou hast any fault.<br>Nor hath my preceptor in this respect issued any command. Curse me if it<br>please thee. I have told thee what the behaviour should be of a Rishi. I<br>do not deserve thy curse, O Devayani. But yet thou hast cursed me! Thou<br>hast acted under the influence of passion and not from a sense of duty.<br>Therefore, thy desire will not be fulfilled. No Rishi's son shall ever<br>accept thy hand in marriage. Thou hast said that my knowledge shall not<br>bear fruit. Let it be so. But in respect of him it shall bear fruit to<br>whom I may impart it.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'That first of Brahmanas, Kacha, having said so<br>unto Devayani speedily wended his way unto the abode of the chief of the<br>celestials. Beholding him arrived, the celestials with Indra ahead,<br>having first worshipped him, spoke unto him as follows, 'Thou hast<br>indeed, performed an act of great benefit for us. Wonderful hath been thy<br>achievement! Thy fame shall never die! Thou shall be a sharer with us in<br>sacrificial offerings.'"
