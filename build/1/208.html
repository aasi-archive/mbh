                            (Viduragamana Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing these various speeches, Dhritarashtra said,<br>The learned Bhishma, the son of Santanu, and the illustrious Rishi Drona,<br>and thyself also (O Vidura), have said the truth and what also is most<br>beneficial to me. Indeed, as those mighty car-warriors, the heroic sons<br>of Kunti. are the children of Pandu, so are they, without doubt, my<br>children according to the ordinance. And as my sons are entitled to this<br>kingdom, so are the sons of Pandu certainly entitled to it. Therefore,<br>hasten to bring hither the Pandavas along with their mother, treating<br>them with affectionate consideration. O thou of Bharata's race, bring<br>also Krishna of celestial beauty along with them. From sheer good fortune<br>the sons of Pritha are alive; and from good fortune alone those mighty<br>car-warriors have obtained the daughter of Drupada. It is from good<br>fortune alone that our strength hath increased, and it is from good<br>fortune alone that Purochana hath perished. O thou of great splendour, it<br>is from good fortune that my great grief hath been killed!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Vidura, at the command of Dhritarashtra,<br>repaired, O Bharata, unto Yajnasena and the Pandavas. And he repaired<br>thither carrying with him numerous jewels and various kinds of wealth for<br>Draupadi and the Pandavas and Yajnasena also. Arrived at Drupada's abode,<br>Vidura conversant with every rule of morality and deep in every science,<br>properly accosted the monarch and waited upon him. Drupada received<br>Vidura in proper form and they both enquired after each other's welfare.<br>Vidura then saw there the Pandavas and Vasudeva. As soon as he saw them<br>he embraced them from affection and enquired after their well being. The<br>Pandavas also along with Vasudeva, in due order, worshipped Vidura of<br>immeasurable intelligence. But Vidura, O king, in the name of<br>Dhritarashtra repeatedly enquired with great affection after their<br>welfare. He then gave, O monarch, unto the Pandavas and Kunti and<br>Draupadi, and unto Drupada and Drupada's sons, the gems and various kinds<br>of wealth that the Kauravas had sent through him. Possessed of<br>immeasurable intelligence, the modest Vidura then, in the presence of the<br>Pandavas and Keshava, addressed the well-behaved Drupada thus:<br><br>"With thy ministers and sons, O monarch, listen to what I say. King<br>Dhritarashtra, with ministers, sons, and friends, hath with a joyous<br>heart, O king, repeatedly enquired after thy welfare. And, O monarch, he<br>hath been highly pleased with this alliance with thee. So also, O king,<br>Bhishma of great wisdom, the son of Santanu, with all the Kurus, enquired<br>after thy welfare in every respect. Drona also of great wisdom the son of<br>Bharadwaja and thy dear friend, embracing thee mentally, enquired of thy<br>happiness. And, O king of Panchalas, Dhritarashtra and all the Kurus, in<br>consequence of this alliance with thee regard themselves supremely blest.<br>O Yajnasena, the establishment of this alliance with thee hath made them<br>happier than if they had acquired a new kingdom. Knowing all this, O<br>monarch, permit the Pandavas to re-visit their ancestral kingdom. The<br>Kurus are exceedingly eager to behold the sons of Pandu. These bulls<br>among men have been long absent (from their kingdom). They as well as<br>Pritha must be very eager to behold their city. And all the Kuru ladies<br>and the citizens and our subjects are eagerly waiting to behold Krishna<br>the Panchala Princess. This, therefore, is my opinion, O monarch, that<br>thou shouldst, without delay, permit the Pandavas to go thither with<br>their wife. And after the illustrious Pandavas, O king, will have<br>received thy permission to go thither, I shall send information unto<br>Dhritarashtra by quick messengers. Then, O king, will the Pandavas set<br>out with Kunti and Krishna.'"
