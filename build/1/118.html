                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'O utterer of Brahma, thou hast recited (everything<br>about) the extraordinary birth among men, of the sons of Dhritarashtra in<br>consequence of the Rishi's grace. Thou hast also said what their names<br>are, according to the order of their birth. O Brahmana, I have heard all<br>these from thee. But tell me now all about the Pandavas. While reciting<br>the incarnations on earth of the celestial, the Asuras, and the beings of<br>other classes, thou saidst that the Pandavas were all illustrious and<br>endued with the prowess of gods, and that they were incarnate portion of<br>the celestials themselves. I desire, therefore, to hear all about those<br>beings of extraordinary achievements beginning from the moment of their<br>birth. O Vaisampayana, recite thou their achievements.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'O king, one day Pandu, while roaming about in the<br>woods (on the southern slopes of the Himavat) that teemed with deer and<br>wild animals of fierce disposition, saw a large deer, that seemed to be<br>the leader of a herd, serving his mate. Beholding the animals, the<br>monarch pierced them both with five of his sharp and swift arrows winged<br>with golden feathers. O monarch, that was no deer that Pandu struck at,<br>but a Rishi's son of great ascetic merit who was enjoying his mate in the<br>form of a deer. Pierced by Pandu, while engaged in the act of<br>intercourse, he fell down to the ground, uttering cries that were of a<br>man and began to weep bitterly.<br><br>"The deer then addressed Pandu and said, 'O king, even men that are<br>slaves to lust and wrath, and void of reason, and ever sinful, never<br>commit such a cruel act as this. Individual judgment prevaileth not<br>against the ordinance, the ordinance prevaileth against individual<br>judgment. The wise never sanction anything discountenanced by the<br>ordinance. Thou art born, O Bharata, in a race that hath ever been<br>virtuous. How is it, therefore, that even thou, suffering thyself to be<br>overpowered by passion and wrath losest thy reason?' Hearing this, Pandu<br>replied, 'O deer, kings behave in the matter of slaying animals of thy<br>species exactly as they do in the matter of slaying foes. It behoveth<br>thee not, therefore, to reprove me thus from ignorance. Animals of thy<br>species are slain by open or covert means. This, indeed, is the practice<br>of kings. Then why dost thou reprove me? Formerly, the Rishi Agastya,<br>while engaged in the performance of a grand sacrifice, chased the deer,<br>and devoted every deer in the forest unto the gods in general. Thou hast<br>been slain, pursuant to the usage sanctioned by such precedent. Wherefore<br>reprovest us then? For his especial sacrifices Agastya performed the homa<br>with fat of the deer.'<br><br>"The deer then said, 'O king, men do not let fly their arrows at their<br>enemies when the latter are unprepared. But there is a time for doing it<br>(viz., after declaration of hostilities). Slaughter at such a time is not<br>censurable.'<br><br>"Pandu replied, 'It is well-known that men slay deer by various effective<br>means without regarding whether the animals are careful or careless.<br>Therefore, O deer, why dost thou reprove me?'<br><br>"The deer then said, 'O, king, I did not blame thee for thy having killed<br>a deer, or for the injury thou hast done to me. But, instead of acting so<br>cruelly, thou shouldst have waited till the completion of my act of<br>intercourse. What man of wisdom and virtue is there that can kill a deer<br>while engaged in such an act? The time of sexual intercourse is agreeable<br>to every creature and productive of good to all. O king, with this my<br>mate I was engaged in the gratification of my sexual desire. But that<br>effort of mine hath been rendered futile by thee. O king of the Kurus, as<br>thou art born in the race of the Pauravas ever noted for white (virtuous)<br>deeds, such an act hath scarcely been worthy of thee. O Bharata, this act<br>must be regarded as extremely cruel, deserving of universal execration,<br>infamous, and sinful, and certainly leading to hell. Thou art acquainted<br>with the pleasures of sexual intercourse. Thou art acquainted also with<br>the teaching of morality and dictates of duty. Like unto a celestial as<br>thou art, it behoveth thee not to do such an act as leadeth to hell. O<br>best of kings, thy duty is to chastise all who act cruelly, who are<br>engaged in sinful practices and who have thrown to the winds religion,<br>profit, and pleasure as explained in the scriptures. What hast thou done,<br>O best of men, in killing me who have given thee no offence? I am, O<br>king, a Muni who liveth on fruits and roots, though disguised as a deer.<br>I was living in the woods in peace with all. Yet thou hast killed me, O<br>king, for which I will curse thee certainly. As thou hast been cruel unto<br>a couple of opposite sexes, death shall certainly overtake thee as soon<br>as thou feelest the influence of sexual desire. I am a Muni of the name<br>of Kindama, possessed of ascetic merit. I was engaged in sexual<br>intercourse with this deer, because my feelings of modesty did not permit<br>me to indulge in such an act in human society. In the form of a deer I<br>rove in the deep woods in the company of other deer. Thou hast slain me<br>without knowing that I am a Brahmana, the sin of having slain a Brahmana<br>shall not, therefore, be thine. But senseless man, as you have killed me,<br>disguised as a deer, at such a time, thy fate shall certainly be even<br>like mine. When, approaching thy wife lustfully, thou wilt unite with her<br>even as I had done with mine, in that very state shalt thou have to go to<br>the world of the spirits. And that wife of thine with whom thou mayst be<br>united in intercourse at the time of thy death shall also follow thee<br>with affection and reverence to the domains of the king of the dead. Thou<br>hast brought me grief when I was happy. So shall grief come to thee when<br>thou art in happiness.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Saying this, that deer, afflicted with grief<br>gave up the ghost; and Pandu also was plunged in woe at the sight.'"
