                            (Khandava-daha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana, said, 'Thus addressed by Arjuna, the smoke-bannered<br>Hutasana, desirous of an interview with Varuna, recollected that son of<br>Aditi,&#8212;that deity protecting one of the points of the heavens and having<br>his home in the water and ruling that element. Varuna, knowing that he<br>was thought of by Pavaka, immediately appeared before that deity. The<br>smoke-bannered celestial welcoming with reverence the ruler of the<br>waters, that fourth of the Lokapalas, said unto that eternal god of gods,<br>'Give me without loss of time that bow and quiver, and that ape-bannered<br>car also, which were obtained from king Soma. Partha will achieve a great<br>task with Gandiva, and Vasudeva also with the discus! Give both,<br>therefore, unto me today.' Hearing these words, Varuna replied unto<br>Pavaka, saying, 'Well, I am giving them.' He then gave that wonderful<br>jewel of a bow that was endued with great energy. That bow was the<br>enhancer of fame and achievements, and was incapable of being injured by<br>any weapon. It was the chief of all weapons, and the grinder of them all.<br>And it was the smiter of hostile armies and was alone equal to a hundred<br>thousand bows. It was the multiplier of kingdoms, and was variegated with<br>excellent colours. It was well-adorned, and beautiful to behold, and<br>without a mark of weakness or injury anywhere. And it was always<br>worshipped both by the celestials and the Gandharvas. Varuna also gave<br>two inexhaustible quivers, and he also gave a car furnished with<br>celestial weapons and whose banner bore a large ape. Yoked unto that car<br>were steeds white as silver of the fleecy clouds, and born in the region<br>of the Gandharvas, and decked with golden harness, and resembling in<br>fleetness the wind or the mind. And it was equipped with implement of<br>war, and was incapable of being vanquished by the celestials or the<br>Asuras. Its splendour was great and the sounds of its wheels was<br>tremendous. It delighted the heart of every creature that looked at it.<br>It had been made by Viswakarman, the architect of the universe and one of<br>the lords of creation, after severe ascetic meditation. Its splendour,<br>like that of the sun, was so great that no one could gaze at it. It was<br>the very car from which the lord Soma had vanquished the Danavas.<br>Resplendent with beauty, it looked like an evening cloud reflecting the<br>effulgence of the setting sun. It was furnished with an excellent<br>flag-staff of golden colour and great beauty. And there sat upon that<br>flag-staff a celestial ape of form fierce like that of a lion or a tiger.<br>Stationed on high, the ape seemed bent upon burning everything it beheld.<br>And upon the (other) flags were various creatures of large size, whose<br>roars and yells caused the enemy's soldiers to faint. Then Arjuna,<br>accoutred in mail and armed with the sword, and his fingers cased in<br>leathern gloves, walking round that excellent car adorned with numerous<br>flags and bowing unto the gods, ascended it like a virtuous man riding in<br>the celestial car that bears him to heaven. And taking up that celestial<br>and first of bows created by Brahman of old and called Gandiva, Arjuna<br>was filled with joy. And bowing unto Hutasana, Partha endued with great<br>energy, took up the bow and strung it forcibly. Those who heard the noise<br>that was made while the mighty Pandava strung that bow, quaked with fear.<br>And having obtained that car and that bow, and the two inexhaustible<br>quivers, the son of Kunti became glad and thought himself competent to<br>assist at the task. And Pavaka then gave unto Krishna a discus with an<br>iron pole attached to a hole in the centre. And it was a fiery weapon and<br>became his favourite. Having obtained that weapon, Krishna also became<br>equal to the task. Pavaka then, addressing Krishna, said, 'With this, O<br>slayer of Madhu, thou shalt be able without doubt to vanquish in battle<br>even foes that are not human. With this weapon, without doubt, thou shalt<br>be superior in battle to men and gods, and Rakshasas and Pisachas, and<br>Daityas and Nagas. And thou shalt certainly be able with this to smite<br>all. And, O Madhava, hurled by thee in battle at thy foes, this weapon<br>will irresistibly slay the enemy and again come back into thy hands.' And<br>the lord Varuna, after this, gave unto Krishna a mace, of name Kaumodaki,<br>capable of slaying every Daitya and producing, when hurled, a roar like<br>that of the thunder. Then Arjuna and Achyuta, filled with joy said unto<br>Pavaka, 'O exalted one, furnished with weapons and knowing their use,<br>possessed of cars with flags and flagstaffs, we are now able to fight<br>with even all the celestials and the Asuras (together), let alone the<br>wielder of the thunderbolt desirous of fighting for the sake of the Naga<br>(his friend Takshaka).' Arjuna also said, 'O Pavaka, while Hrishikesa,<br>endued with abundant energy, moves on the field of battle with this<br>discus in hand, there is nothing in the three worlds that he will not be<br>able to consume by hurling this weapon. Having obtained the bow Gandiva<br>and this couple of inexhaustible quivers I also am ready to conquer in<br>battle the three worlds. Therefore, O lord, blaze thou forth as thou<br>likest, surrounding this large forest on every side. We are quite able to<br>help thee.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed both by Dasarha and Arjuna, the<br>illustrious god then put forth his most energetic form, and prepared to<br>consume the forest. Surrounding it on all sides with his seven flames, he<br>began to consume the forest of Khandava, exhibiting his all-consuming<br>form like that at the end of the Yuga (cycle). And, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, surrounding that forest and catching it from all sides with a roar<br>like that of the clouds, Agni made every creature within it tremble. And,<br>O Bharata, that burning forest then looked resplendent like the king of<br>mountains, Meru, blazing with the rays of the sun fallen thereupon.'"
