                            (Jatugriha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'About this time, the learned Vidura had sent into<br>those woods a man of pure character and much trusted by him. This person<br>going to where he had been directed, saw the Pandavas with their mother<br>in the forest employed in a certain place in measuring the depth of a<br>river. The design that the wicked Duryodhana had formed had been, through<br>his spies, known to Vidura of great intelligence, and, therefore, he had<br>sent that prudent person unto the Pandavas. Sent by Vidura unto them, he<br>showed the Pandavas on the sacred banks of the Ganga a boat with engines<br>and flags, constructed by trusted artificers and capable of withstanding<br>wind and wave and endued with the speed of the tempest or of thought. He<br>then addressed the Pandavas in these words to show that he had really<br>been sent by Vidura, 'O Yudhishthira, he said, "listen to these words the<br>learned Vidura had said (unto thee) as a proof of the fact that I come<br>from him. Neither the consumer of straw and the wood nor the drier of dew<br>ever burneth the inmates of a hole in the forest. He escapeth from death<br>who protecteth himself knowing this, etc.' By these credentials know me<br>to be the person who has been truly sent by Vidura and to be also his<br>trusted agent. Vidura, conversant with everything, hath again said, 'O<br>son of Kunti, thou shalt surely defeat in battle Karna, and Duryodhana<br>with his brothers, and Sakuni.' This boat is ready on the waters, and it<br>will glide pleasantly thereon, and shall certainly bear you all from<br>these regions!'<br><br>"Then beholding those foremost of men with their mother pensive and sad<br>he caused them to go into the boat that was on the Ganga, and accompanied<br>them himself. Addressing them again, he said, 'Vidura having smelt your<br>heads and embraced you (mentally), hath said again that in commencing<br>your auspicious journey and going alone you should never be careless.'<br><br>"Saying these words unto those heroic princes, the person sent by Vidura<br>took those bulls among men over to the other side of the Ganga in his<br>boat. And having taken them over the water and seen them all safe on the<br>opposite bank, he uttered the word 'Jaya' (victory) to their success and<br>then left them and returned to the place whence he had come.<br><br>"The illustrious Pandavas also sending through that person some message<br>to Vidura, began, after having crossed the Ganga, to proceed with haste<br>and in great secrecy.'"
