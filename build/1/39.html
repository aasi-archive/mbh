                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'O best of regenerate ones, hearing these words of Elapatra,<br>all the serpents, in great delight, exclaimed, 'Well said, well said!'<br>And from that time Vasuki set about carefully bringing up that maiden,<br>viz., his sister Jaratkaru. And he took great delight in rearing her.<br><br>"And much time did not elapse from this, when the gods and the Asuras,<br>assembling together, churned the abode of Varuna. And Vasuki, the<br>foremost of all gifted with strength, became the churning-cord. And<br>directly the work was over, the king of the snakes presented himself<br>before the Grandsire. And the gods, accompanied by Vasuki, addressed the<br>Grandsire, saying, 'O lord, Vasuki is suffering great affliction from<br>fear of (his mother's curse). It behoveth thee to root out the sorrow,<br>begotten of the curse of his mother, that hath pierced the heart of<br>Vasuki desirous of the weal of his race. The king of the snakes is ever<br>our friend and benefactor. O Lord of the gods, be gracious unto him and<br>assuage his mind's fever.'<br><br>"Brahman replied, 'O ye immortals, I have thought, in my mind, of what ye<br>have said. Let the king of the snakes do that which hath been<br>communicated to him before by Elapatra. The time hath arrived. Those only<br>shall be destroyed that are wicked, not those that are virtuous.<br>Jaratkaru hath been born, and that Brahmana is engaged in hard ascetic<br>penances. Let Vasuki, at the proper time, bestow on him his sister. Ye<br>gods, what hath been spoken by the snake Elapatra for the weal of the<br>snakes is true and not otherwise.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Then the king of the snakes, Vasuki, afflicted with<br>the curse of his mother, hearing these words of the Grandsire, and<br>intending to bestow his sister of the Rishi Jaratkaru, commanded all the<br>serpents, a large numbers of whom were ever attentive to their duties, to<br>watch the Rishi Jaratkaru, saying, 'When the lord Jaratkaru will ask for<br>a wife, come immediately and inform me of it. The weal of our race<br>depends upon it.'"
