                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'O Brahmana, I have, indeed, heard from thee this<br>account of the incarnation, according to their portions, of the gods, the<br>Danavas, the Rakshasas, and also of the Gandharvas and the Apsaras. I<br>however, again desire to hear of the dynasty of the Kurus from the very<br>beginning. Therefore, O Brahmana, speak of this in the presence of all<br>these regenerate Rishis.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'O exalted one of Bharata's race, the founder of the<br>Paurava line was Dushmanta gifted with great energy. And he was the<br>protector of the earth bounded by the four seas. And that king had full<br>sway over four quarters of this world. And he was the lord also of<br>various regions in the midst of the sea. And that great oppressor of all<br>foes had sway over the countries even of the Mlechchhas.<br><br>"And during his rule there were no men of mixed castes, no tillers of the<br>soil (for the land, of itself, yielded produce), no workers of mines (for<br>the surface of the earth yielded in abundance), and no sinful men. All<br>were virtuous, and did everything from virtuous motives, O tiger among<br>men. There was no fear of thieves, O dear one, no fear of famine, no fear<br>off disease. And all four orders took pleasure in doing their respective<br>duties and never performed religious acts for obtaining fruition of<br>desires. And his subjects, depending upon him, never entertained any<br>fear. And Parjanya (Indra) poured showers at the proper time, and the<br>produce of the fields was always pulpy and juicy. And the earth was full<br>of all kinds of wealth and all kinds of animals. And the Brahmanas were<br>always engaged in their duties and they were always truthful. And the<br>youthful monarch was endued with wonderful prowess and a physical frame<br>hard as the thunderbolt, so that he could, taking up the mountain Mandara<br>with its forests and bushes, support it on his arms. And he was<br>well-skilled in four kinds of encounters with the mace (hurling it at<br>foes at a distance, striking at those that are near, whirling it in the<br>midst of many, and driving the foe before). And he was skilled also in<br>the use of all kinds of weapons and in riding elephants and horses. And<br>in strength he was like unto Vishnu, in splendour like unto the maker of<br>day, in gravity like unto the ocean, and in patience, like unto the<br>earth. And the monarch was loved by all his subjects, and he ruled his<br>contented people virtuously.'"
