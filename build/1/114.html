                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Pandu, then, at the command of Dhritarashtra,<br>offered the wealth he had acquired by the prowess of his arms to Bhishma,<br>their grand-mother Satyavati and their mothers. And he sent portion of<br>his wealth to Vidura also. And the virtuous Pandu gratified his other<br>relatives also with similar presents. Then Satyavati and Bhishma and the<br>Kosala princes were all gratified with the presents Pandu made out of the<br>acquisitions of his prowess. And Ambalika in particular, upon embracing<br>her son of incomparable prowess, became as glad as the queen of heaven<br>upon embracing Jayanta. And with the wealth acquired by that hero<br>Dhritarashtra performed five great sacrifices that were equal unto a<br>hundred great horse-sacrifices, at all of which the offerings to<br>Brahmanas were by hundreds and thousands.<br><br>"A little while after, O bull of Bharata's race, Pandu who had achieved a<br>victory over sloth and lethargy, accompanied by his two wives, Kunti and<br>Madri, retired into the woods. Leaving his excellent palace with its<br>luxurious beds, he became a permanent inhabitant of the woods, devoting<br>the whole of his time to the chase of the deer. And fixing his abode in a<br>delightful and hilly region overgrown with huge sala trees, on the<br>southern slope of the Himavat mountains, he roamed about in perfect<br>freedom. The handsome Pandu with his two wives wandered in those woods<br>like Airavata accompanied by two she-elephants. And the dwellers in those<br>woods, beholding the heroic Bharata prince in the company of his wives,<br>armed with sword, arrows, and bow, clad with his beautiful armour, and<br>skilled in all excellent weapons, regarded him as the very god wandering<br>amongst them.<br><br>"And at the command of Dhritarashtra, people were busy in supplying Pandu<br>in his retirement with every object of pleasure and enjoyment.<br><br>"Meanwhile the son of the ocean-going Ganga heard that king Devaka had a<br>daughter endued with youth and beauty and begotten upon a Sudra wife.<br>Bringing her from her father's abode, Bhishma married her to Vidura of<br>great wisdom. And Vidura begot upon her many children like unto himself<br>in accomplishments.'"
