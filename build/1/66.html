                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'It is known that the spiritual sons of Brahman were<br>the six great Rishis (already mentioned). There was another of the name<br>of Sthanu. And the sons of Sthanu, gifted with great energy, were, it is<br>known, eleven. They were Mrigavayadha, Sarpa, Niriti of great fame:<br>Ajaikapat, Ahivradhna, and Pinaki, the oppressor of foes; Dahana and<br>Iswara, and Kapali of great splendour; and Sthanu, and the illustrious<br>Bharga. These are called the eleven Rudras. It hath been already said,<br>that Marichi, Angiras. Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu&#8212;these six great<br>Rishis of great energy&#8212;are the sons of Brahman. It is well-known in the<br>world that Angiras's sons are three,&#8212;Vrihaspati, Utathya, and Samvarta,<br>all of rigid vows. And, O king, it is said that the sons of Atri are<br>numerous. And, being great Rishis, they are all conversant with the<br>Vedas, crowned with ascetic success, and of souls in perfect peace. And,<br>O tiger among kings, the sons of Pulastya of great wisdom are Rakshasas,<br>Monkeys, Kinnaras (half-men and half-horses), and Yakshas. And, O king,<br>the son of Pulaha were, it is said, the Salabhas (the winged insects),<br>the lions, the Kimpurushas (half-lions and half-men), the tigers, bears,<br>and wolves. And the sons of Kratu, sacred as sacrifices, are the<br>companions of Surya, (the Valikhilyas), known in three worlds and devoted<br>to truth and vows. And, O protector of the Earth, the illustrious Rishi<br>Daksha, of soul in complete peace, and of great asceticism, sprung from<br>the right toe of Brahman. And from the left toe of Brahman sprang the<br>wife of the high-souled Daksha. And the Muni begat upon her fifty<br>daughters; and all those daughters were of faultless features and limbs<br>and of eyes like lotus-petals. And the lord Daksha, not having any sons,<br>made those daughters his Putrikas (so that their sons might belong both<br>to himself and to their husbands). And Daksha bestowed, according to the<br>sacred ordinance, ten of his daughters on Dharma, twenty-seven on Chandra<br>(the Moon), and thirteen on Kasyapa. Listen as I recount the wives of<br>Dharma according to their names. They are ten in all&#8212;Kirti, Lakshmi,<br>Dhriti, Medha, Pushti, Sraddha, Kria, Buddhi, Lajja, and Mali. These are<br>the wives of Dharma as appointed by the Self-create. It is known also<br>throughout the world that the wives of Soma (Moon) are twenty-seven. And<br>the wives of Soma, all of sacred vows, are employed in indicating time;<br>and they are the Nakshatras and the Yoginis and they became so for<br>assisting the courses of the worlds.<br><br>"And Brahman had another son named Manu. And Manu had a son of the name<br>of Prajapati. And the sons of Prajapati were eight and were called Vasus<br>whom I shall name in detail. They were Dhara, Dhruva, Soma, Aha, Anila,<br>Anala, Pratyusha, and Prabhasa. These eight are known as the Vasus. Of<br>these, Dhara and the truth-knowing Dhruva were born of Dhumra; Chandramas<br>(Soma) and Swasana (Anila) were born of the intelligent Swasa; Aha was<br>the son of Rata: and Hutasana (Anala) of Sandilya; and Pratyusha and<br>Prabhasa were the sons of Prabhata. And Dhara had two sons, Dravina and<br>Huta-havya-vaha. And the son of Dhruva is the illustrious Kala (Time),<br>the destroyer of the worlds. And Soma's son is the resplendent Varchas.<br>And Varchas begot upon his wife Manohara three sons&#8212;Sisira, and Ramana.<br>And the son of Aha were Jyotih, Sama, Santa, and also Muni. And the son<br>of Agni is the handsome Kumara born in a forest of reeds. And, he is also<br>called Kartikeya because he was reared by Krittika and others. And, after<br>Kartikeya, there were born his three brothers Sakha, Visakha, Naigameya.<br>And the wife of Anila is Siva, and Siva's son were Manojava and<br>Avijnataagati. These two were the sons of Anila. The son of Pratyusha,<br>you must know, is the Rishi named Devala; and Devala had two sons who<br>were both exceedingly forgiving and of great mental power. And the sister<br>of Vrihaspati, the first of women, uttering the sacred truth, engaged in<br>ascetic penances, roamed over the whole earth; and she became the wife of<br>Prabhasa, the eighth Vasu. And she brought forth the illustrious<br>Viswakarman, the founder of all arts. And he was the originator of a<br>thousand arts, the engineer of the immortals, the maker of all kinds of<br>ornaments, and the first of artists. And he it was who constructed the<br>celestial cars of the gods, and mankind are enabled to live in<br>consequence of the inventions of that illustrious one. And he is<br>worshipped, for that reason, by men. And he is eternal and immutable,<br>this Viswakarman.<br><br>"And the illustrious Dharma, the dispenser of all happiness, assuming a<br>human countenance, came out through the right breast of Brahman. And<br>Ahasta (Dharma) hath three excellent sons capable of charming every<br>creature. And they are Sama, Kama, Harsha (Peace, Desire, and Joy). And<br>by their energy they are supporting the worlds. And the wife of Kama is<br>Rati, of Sama is Prapti; and the wife of Harsha is Nanda. And upon them,<br>indeed, are the worlds made to depend.<br><br>"And the son of Marichi is Kasyapa. And Kasyapa's offspring are the gods<br>and the Asuras. And, therefore, is Kasyapa, the Father of the worlds. And<br>Tvashtri, of the form of Vadava (a mare), became the wife of Savitri. And<br>she gave birth, in the skies, to two greatly fortunate twins, the Aswins.<br>And, O king, the sons of Aditi are twelve with Indra heading them all.<br>And the youngest of them all was Vishnu upon whom the worlds depend.<br><br>"These are the thirty-three gods (the eight Vasus, the eleven Rudras, the<br>twelve Adityas, Prajapati, and Vashatkara). I shall now recount their<br>progeny according to their Pakshas, Kulas, and Ganas. The Rudras, the<br>Saddhyas, the Maruts, the Vasus, the Bhargavas, and the Viswedevas are<br>each reckoned as a Paksha. Garuda the son of Vinata and the mighty Aruna<br>also, and the illustrious Vrihaspati are reckoned among the Adityas. The<br>twin Aswins, all annual plants, and all inferior animals, are reckoned<br>among the Guhyakas.<br><br>"These are the Ganas of the gods recited to thee, O king! This recitation<br>washes men of all sins.<br><br>"The illustrious Bhrigu came out, ripping open the breast of Brahman. The<br>learned Sukra is Bhrigu's son. And the learned Sukra becoming a planet<br>and engaged according to the command of the Self-existent in pouring and<br>withholding rain, and in dispensing and remitting calamities, traverses,<br>for sustaining the lives of all the creatures in the three worlds,<br>through the skies. And the learned Sukra, of great intelligence and<br>wisdom, of rigid vows, leading the life of a Brahmacharin, divided<br>himself in twain by power of asceticism, and became the spiritual guide<br>of both the Daityas and the gods. And after Sukra was thus employed by<br>Brahman in seeking the welfare (of the gods and the Asuras), Bhrigu begot<br>another excellent son. This was Chyavana who was like the blazing sun, of<br>virtuous soul, and of great fame. And he came out of his mother's womb in<br>anger and became the cause of his mother's release, O king (from the<br>hands of the Rakshasas). And Arushi, the daughter of Manu, became the<br>wife of the wise Chyavana. And, on her was begotten Aurva of great<br>reputation. And he came out, ripping open the thigh of Arushi. And Aurva<br>begot Richika. And Richika even in his boyhood became possessed of great<br>power and energy, and of every virtue. And Richika begot Jamadagni. And<br>the high-souled Jamadagni had four sons. And the youngest of them all was<br>Rama (Parasurama). And Rama was superior to all his brothers in the<br>possession of good qualities. And he was skilful in all weapons, and<br>became the slayer of the Kshatriyas. And he had his passions under<br>complete control. And Aurva had a hundred sons with Jamadagni the eldest.<br>And these hundred sons had offspring by thousands spread over this earth.<br><br>"And Brahman had two other sons, viz., Dhatri and Vidhatri who stayed<br>with Manu. Their sister is the auspicious Lakshmi having her abode amid<br>lotuses. And the spiritual sons of Lakshmi are the sky-ranging horses.<br>And the daughter born of Sukra, named Divi, became the eldest wife of<br>Varuna. Of her were born a son named Vala and a daughter named Sura<br>(wine), to the joy of the gods. And Adharma (Sin) was born when creatures<br>(from want of food) began to devour one another. And Adharma always<br>destroys every creature. And Adharma hath Niriti for his wife, whence the<br>Rakshasas who are called Nairitas (offspring of Niriti). And she hath<br>also three other cruel sons always engaged in sinful deeds. They are<br>Bhaya (fear), Mahabhaya (terror), and Mrityu (Death) who is always<br>engaged in slaying every created thing. And, as he is all-destroying, he<br>hath no wife, and no son. And Tamra brought forth five daughters known<br>throughout the worlds. They are Kaki (crow), Syeni (hawk), Phasi (hen),<br>Dhritarashtri (goose), and Suki (parrot). And Kaki brought forth the<br>crows; Syeni, the hawks, the cocks and vultures, Dhritarashtri, all ducks<br>and swans; and she also brought forth all Chakravakas; and the fair Suki,<br>of amiable qualities, and possessing all auspicious signs brought forth<br>all the parrots. And Krodha gave birth to nine daughters, all of wrathful<br>disposition. And their names were Mrigi, Mrigamanda, Hari, Bhadramana,<br>Matangi, Sarduli, Sweta, Surabhi, and the agreeable Surasa blessed with<br>every virtue. And, O foremost of men, the offspring of Mrigi are all<br>animals of the deer species. And the offspring of Mrigamanda are all<br>animals of the bear species and those called Srimara (sweet-footed). And<br>Bhadramana begot the celestial elephants, Airavata. And the offspring of<br>Hari are all animals of the simian species endued with great activity, so<br>also all the horses. And those animals also, that are called Go-langula<br>(the cow-tailed), are said to be the offspring of Hari. And Sarduli begot<br>lions and tigers in numbers, and also leopards and all other strong<br>animals. And, O king, the offspring of Matangi are all the elephants. And<br>Sweta begat the large elephant known by the name of Sweta, endued with<br>great speed. And, O king, Surabhi gave birth to two daughters, the<br>amiable Rohini and the far-famed Gandharvi. And, O Bharata, she had also<br>two other daughters named Vimala and Anala. From Rohini have sprung all<br>kine, and from Gandharvi all animals of the horse species. And Anala<br>begat the seven kinds of trees yielding pulpy fruits. (They are the date,<br>the palm, the hintala, the tali, the little date, the nut, and the<br>cocoanut.) And she had also another daughter called Suki (the mother of<br>the parrot species). And Surasa bore a son called Kanka (a species of<br>long-feathered birds). And Syeni, the wife of Aruna, gave birth to two<br>sons of great energy and strength, named Sampati and the mighty Jatayu.<br>Surasa also bore the Nagas, and Kadru, the Punnagas (snakes). And Vinata<br>had two sons Garuda and Aruna, known far and wide. And, O king of men, O<br>foremost of intelligent persons, thus hath the genealogy of all the<br>principal creatures been fully described by me. By listening to this, a<br>man is fully cleansed of all his sins, and acquireth great knowledge, and<br>finally attaineth to the first of states in after-life!'"
