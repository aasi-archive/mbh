                            (Viduragamana Parva)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'The news was carried unto all the monarchs (who had<br>come to the Self-choice of Draupadi) by their trusted spies that the<br>handsome Draupadi had been united in marriage with the sons of Pandu. And<br>they were also informed that the illustrious hero who had bent the bow<br>and shot the mark was none else than Arjuna, that foremost of victorious<br>warriors and first of all wielders of the bow and arrows. And it became<br>known that the mighty warrior who had dashed Salya, the king of Madra, on<br>the ground, and who in wrath had terrified the assembled monarchs by<br>means of the tree (he had uprooted), and who had taken his stand before<br>all foes in perfect fearlessness, was none else than Bhima, that feller<br>of hostile ranks, whose touch alone was sufficient to take the lives out<br>of all foes. The monarchs, upon being informed that the Pandavas had<br>assumed the guise of peaceful Brahmanas, wondered much. They even heard<br>that Kunti with all her sons had been burnt to death in the conflagration<br>of the house of lac. They, therefore, now regarded the Pandavas in the<br>light of persons who had come back from the region of the dead. And<br>recollecting the cruel scheme contrived by Purochana, they began to say,<br>'O, fie on Bhishma, fie on Dhritarashtra of the Kuru race!'<br><br>"After the Self-choice was over, all the monarchs (who had come thither),<br>hearing that Draupadi had been united with the Pandavas, set out for<br>their own dominions. And Duryodhana, hearing that Draupadi had selected<br>the owner of white steeds (Arjuna) as her lord, became greatly depressed.<br>Accompanied by his brothers, Aswatthaman, his uncle (Sakuni), Karna and<br>Kripa the prince set out with a heavy heart for his capital. Then<br>Duhsasana, blushing with shame, addressed his brother softly and said,<br>'If Arjuna had not disguised himself as a Brahmana, he could never have<br>succeeded in obtaining Draupadi. It was for this disguise, O king, that<br>no one could recognise him as Dhananjaya. Fate, I ween, is ever supreme.<br>Exertion is fruitless; fie on our exertions, O brother! The Pandavas are<br>still alive!' Speaking unto one another thus and blaming Purochana (for<br>his carelessness), they then entered the city of Hastinapura, with<br>cheerless and sorrowful hearts. Beholding the mighty sons of Pritha,<br>escaped from the burning house of lac and allied with Drupada, and<br>thinking of Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin and the other sons of Drupada<br>all accomplished in fight, they were struck with fear and overcome with<br>despair.<br><br>"Then Vidura, having learnt that Draupadi had been won by the Pandavas<br>and that the sons of Dhritarashtra had come back (to Hastinapura) in<br>shame, their pride humiliated, became filled with joy. And, O king,<br>approaching Dhritarashtra, Kshattri said, 'The Kurus are prospering by<br>good luck!' Hearing those words of Vidura, the son of Vichitravirya,<br>wondering, said in great glee, 'What good luck, O Vidura! What good<br>luck!' From ignorance, the blind monarch understood that his eldest son<br>Duryodhana had been chosen by Drupada's daughter as her lord. And the<br>king immediately ordered various ornaments to be made for Draupadi. And<br>he commanded that both Draupadi and his son Duryodhana should be brought<br>with pomp to Hastinapura. It was then that Vidura told the monarch that<br>Draupadi had chosen the Pandavas for her lords, and that those heroes<br>were all alive and at peace, and that they had been received with great<br>respect by king Drupada. And he also informed Dhritarashtra that the<br>Pandavas had been united with the many relatives and friends of Drupada,<br>each owning large armies, and with many others who had come to that<br>self-choice.<br><br>"Hearing these words of Vidura, Dhritarashtra said, 'Those children are<br>to me as dear as they were to Pandu. Nay, more. O listen to me why my<br>affection for them now is even greater! The heroic sons of Pandu are well<br>and at ease. They have obtained many friends. Their relatives, and others<br>whom they have gained as allies, are all endued with great strength. Who<br>amongst monarchs in prosperity or adversity would not like to have<br>Drupada with his relatives as an ally?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having heard these words of the monarch, Vidura<br>said, 'O king, let thy understanding remain so without change for a<br>hundred years!' Having said this Vidura returned to his own abode. Then,<br>O monarch, there came unto Dhritarashtra, Duryodhana and the son of<br>Radha, Karna. Addressing the monarch, they said, 'We cannot, O king,<br>speak of any transgression in the presence of Vidura! We have now found<br>thee alone, and will, therefore, say all we like! What is this that thou<br>hast, O monarch, desired to do? Dost thou regard the prosperity of thy<br>foes as if it were thy own, that thou hast been applauding the Pandavas,<br>O foremost of men, in the presence of Vidura? O sinless one, thou actest<br>not, O king, in the way thou shouldst! O father, we should now act every<br>day in such a way as to weaken (the strength of) the Pandavas. The time<br>hath come, O father, for us to take counsel together, so that the<br>Pandavas may not swallow us all with our children and friends and<br>relatives.'"
