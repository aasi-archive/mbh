                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Yayati, then, overcome with decrepitude, returned to<br>his capital and summoning his eldest son Yadu who was also the most<br>accomplished, addressed him thus, 'Dear child, from the curse of Kavya<br>called also Usanas, decrepitude and wrinkles and whiteness of hair have<br>come over me. But I have not been gratified yet with the enjoyment of<br>youth. Do thou, O Yadu, take this my weakness along with my decrepitude.<br>I shall enjoy with thy youth. And when a full thousand years will have<br>elapsed, returning to thee thy youth, I shall take back my weakness with<br>this decrepitude!'<br><br>"Yadu replied, 'There are innumerable inconveniences in decrepitude, in<br>respect of drinking and eating. Therefore, O king, I shall not take thy<br>decrepitude. This is, indeed, my determination. White hair on the head,<br>cheerlessness and relaxation of the nerves, wrinkles all over the body,<br>deformities, weakness of the limbs, emaciation, incapacity to work,<br>defeat at the hands of friends and companions&#8212;these are the consequences<br>of decrepitude. Therefore, O king, I desire not to take it. O king, thou<br>hast many sons some of whom are dearer to thee. Thou art acquainted with<br>the precepts of virtue. Ask some other son of thine to take thy<br>decrepitude.<br><br>"Yayati replied, 'Thou art sprung from my heart, O son, but thou givest<br>me not thy youth. Therefore, thy children shall never be kings.' And he<br>continued, addressing another son of his, 'O Turvasu, take thou this<br>weakness of mine along with my decrepitude. With thy youth, O son, I like<br>to enjoy the pleasure of life. After the lapse of a full thousand years I<br>shall give back to thee thy youth, and take back from thee my weakness<br>and decrepitude.'<br><br>"Turvasu replied, 'I do not like decrepitude, O father, it takes away all<br>appetites and enjoyments, strength and beauty of person, intellect, and<br>even life.' Yayati said to him, 'Thou art sprung from my heart, O son!<br>But thou givest me not thy youth! Therefore, O Turvasu, thy race shall be<br>extinct. Wretch, thou shall be the king of those whose practices and<br>precepts are impure, amongst whom men of inferior blood procreate<br>children upon women of blue blood, who live on meat, who are mean, who<br>hesitate not to appropriate the wives of their superiors, whose practices<br>are those of birds and beasts, who are sinful, and non-Aryan.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Yayati, having thus cursed his son Turvasu, then,<br>addressed Sarmishtha's son Drahyu thus, 'O Drahyu, take thou for a<br>thousand years my decrepitude destructive of complexion and personal<br>beauty and give me thy youth. When a thousand years have passed away, I<br>shall return thee thy youth and take back my own weakness, and<br>decrepitude.' To this Drahyu replied, 'O king, one that is decrepit can<br>never enjoy elephants and cars and horses and women. Even his voice<br>becometh hoarse. Therefore, I do not desire (to take) thy decrepitude.'<br>Yayati said to him, 'Thou art sprung from my heart, O son! But thou<br>refusest to give me thy youth. Therefore, thy most cherished desires<br>shall never be fulfilled. Thou shalt be king only in name, of that region<br>where there are no roads for (the passage of) horses and cars and<br>elephants, and good vehicles, and asses, and goats and bullocks, and<br>palanquins; where there is swimming only by rafts and floats.' Yayati<br>next addressed Anu and said, 'O Anu, take my weakness and decrepitude. I<br>shall with thy youth enjoy the pleasures of life for a thousand years.'<br>To this Anu replied, 'Those that are decrepit always eat like children<br>and are always impure. They cannot pour libations upon fire in proper<br>times. Therefore, I do not like to take thy decrepitude.' Yayati said to<br>him, 'Thou art sprung from my heart, thou givest not thy youth. Thou<br>findest so many faults in decrepitude. Therefore, decrepitude shall<br>overcome thee! And, O Anu, thy progeny also as soon as they attain to<br>youth, shall die. And thou shalt also not be able to perform sacrifices<br>before fire.'<br><br>"Yayati at last turned to his youngest child, Puru, and addressing him<br>said, 'Thou art, O Puru, my youngest son! But thou shall be the first of<br>all! Decrepitude, wrinkles, and whiteness of hair have come over me in<br>consequence of the curse of Kavya called also Usanas. I have not yet<br>however, been satiated with my youth. O Puru, take thou this my weakness<br>and decrepitude! With thy youth I shall enjoy for some years the<br>pleasures of life. And when a thousand years have passed away, I shall<br>give back to thee thy youth and take back my own decrepitude.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed by the king, Puru answered with<br>humility, 'I shall do, O monarch, as thou bidest me. I shall take, O<br>king, thy weakness and decrepitude. Take thou my youth and enjoy as thou<br>listest the pleasures of life. Covered with thy decrepitude and becoming<br>old, I shall, as thou commandest, continue to live, giving thee my<br>youth.' Yayati then said, 'O Puru, I have been gratified with thee. And<br>being gratified, I tell thee that the people in thy kingdom shall have<br>all their desires fulfilled.'<br><br>"And having said this, the great ascetic Yayati, then thinking of Kavya,<br>transferred his decrepitude unto the body of the high-souled Puru.'"
