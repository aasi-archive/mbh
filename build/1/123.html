                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'O Janamejaya, when Gandhari's conception had been a<br>full year old, it was then that Kunti summoned the eternal god of justice<br>to obtain offspring from him. And she offered without loss of time,<br>sacrifices unto the god and began to duly repeat the formula that Durvasa<br>had imparted to her some time before. Then the god, overpowered by her<br>incantations, arrived at the spot where Kunti was seated in his car<br>resplendent as the Sun. Smiling, he asked, 'O Kunti, what am I to give<br>thee?' And Kunti too smiling in her turn, replied, 'Thou must even give<br>me offspring.' Then the handsome Kunti was united (in intercourse) with<br>the god of justice in his spiritual form and obtained from him a son<br>devoted to the good of all creatures. And she brought his excellent<br>child, who lived to acquire a great fame, at the eighth Muhurta called<br>Abhijit, of the hour of noon of that very auspicious day of the seventh<br>month (Kartika), viz., the fifth of the lighted fortnight, when the star<br>Jyeshtha in conjunction with the moon was ascendant. And as soon as the<br>child was born, an incorporeal voice (from the skies) said, 'This child<br>shall be the best of men, the foremost of those that are virtuous. Endued<br>with great prowess and truthful in speech, he shall certainly be the<br>ruler of the earth. And this first child of Pandu shall be known by the<br>name of Yudhishthira. Possessed of prowess and honesty of disposition, he<br>shall be a famous king, known throughout the three worlds.'<br><br>"Pandu, having obtained that virtuous son, again addressed his wife and<br>said. 'The wise have declared that a Kshatriya must be endued with<br>physical strength, otherwise he is no Kshatriya.' Therefore, ask thou for<br>an offspring of superior strength. Thus commanded by her lord, Kunti then<br>invoked Vayu. And the mighty god of wind, thus invoked, came unto her,<br>riding upon a deer, and said, 'What, O Kunti, am I to give thee? Tell me<br>what is in thy heart" Smiling in modesty, she said to him, 'Give me, O<br>best of celestials, a child endued with great strength and largeness of<br>limbs and capable of humbling the pride of every body.' The god of wind<br>thereupon begat upon her the child afterwards known as Bhima of mighty<br>arms and fierce prowess. And upon the birth of that child endued with<br>extraordinary strength, an incorporeal voice, O Bharata, as before, said,<br>'This child shall be the foremost of all endued with strength.' I must<br>tell you, O Bharata, of another wonderful event that occurred alter the<br>birth of Vrikodara (Bhima). While he fell from the lap of his mother upon<br>the mountain breast, the violence of the fall broke into fragments the<br>stone upon which he fell without his infant body being injured in the<br>least. And he fell from his mother's lap because Kunti, frightened by a<br>tiger, had risen up suddenly, unconscious of the child that lay asleep on<br>her lap. And as she had risen, the infant, of body hard as the<br>thunderbolt, falling down upon the mountain breast, broke into a hundred<br>fragments the rocky mass upon which he fell. And beholding this, Pandu<br>wondered much. And it so happened that that very day on which Vrikodara<br>was born, was also, O best of Bharatas, the birthday of Duryodhana who<br>afterwards became the ruler of the whole earth.'<br><br>"After the birth of Vrikodara, Pandu again began to think, 'How am I to<br>obtain a very superior son who shall achieve world-wide fame? Every,<br>thing in the world dependeth on destiny and exertion. But destiny can<br>never be successful except by timely exertion. We have heard it said that<br>Indra is the chief of the gods. Indeed, he is endued with immeasurable<br>might and energy and prowess and glory. Gratifying him with my<br>asceticism, I shall obtain from him a son of great strength. Indeed, the<br>son he giveth me must be superior to all and capable of vanquishing in<br>battle all men and creatures other than men. I shall, therefore, practise<br>the severest austerities, with heart, deed and speech.'<br><br>"After this, the Kuru king Pandu, taking counsel with the great Rishis<br>commanded Kunti to observe an auspicious vow for one full year, while he<br>himself commenced, O Bharata, to stand upon one leg from morning to<br>evening, and practise other severe austerities with mind rapt in<br>meditation, for gratifying the lord of the celestials.<br><br>"It was after a long time that Indra (gratified with such devotion)<br>approached Pandu and, addressing him, said, 'I shall give thee, O king, a<br>son who will be celebrated all over the three worlds and who will promote<br>the welfare of Brahmanas, kine and all honest men. The son I shall give<br>thee will be the smiter of the wicked and the delight of friends and<br>relatives. Foremost of all men, he will be an irresistible slayer of all<br>foes.' Thus addressed by Vasava (the king of the celestials), the<br>virtuous king of the Kuru race, well-recollecting those words, said unto<br>Kunti, 'O fortunate one, thy vow hath become successful. The lord of the<br>celestials hath been gratified, and is willing to give thee a son such as<br>thou desirest, of superhuman achievements and great fame. He will be the<br>oppressor of all enemies and possessed of great wisdom. Endued with a<br>great soul, in splendour equal unto the Sun, invincible in battles, and<br>of great achievements, he will also be extremely handsome. O thou of fair<br>hips and sweet smiles, the lord of the celestials hath become gracious to<br>thee. Invoking him, bring thou forth a child who will be the very home of<br>all Kshatriya virtues.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The celebrated Kunti, thus addressed by her<br>lord, invoked Sakra (the king of the gods) who thereupon came unto her<br>and begat him that was afterwards called Arjuna. And as soon as this<br>child was born, an incorporeal voice, loud and deep as that of the clouds<br>and filling the whole welkin, distinctly said, addressing Kunti in the<br>hearing of every creature dwelling in that asylum, 'This child of thine,<br>O Kunti, will be equal unto Kartavirya in energy and Siva in prowess.<br>Invincible like Sakra himself he will spread thy fame far and wide. As<br>Vishnu (the youngest of Aditi's sons) had enhanced Aditi's joy, so shall<br>this child enhance thy joy. Subjugating the Madras, the Kurus along with<br>the Somakas, and the people of Chedi, Kasi and Karusha, he will maintain<br>the prosperity of the Kurus. (Surfeited with libations at the sacrifice<br>of king Swetaketu), Agni will derive great gratification from the fat of<br>all creatures dwelling in the Khandava woods (to be burnt down) by the<br>might of this one's arms. This mighty hero, vanquishing all the<br>effeminate monarchs of the earth, will, with his brothers perform three<br>great sacrifices. In prowess, O Kunti, he will be even as Jamadagnya or<br>Vishnu. The foremost of all men endued with prowess, he will achieve<br>great fame. He will gratify in battle (by his heroism) Sankara, the god<br>of gods (Mahadeva), and will receive from him the great weapon named<br>Pasupata. This thy son of mighty arms will also slay, at the command of<br>Indra, those Daityas called the Nivatakavachas who are the enemies of the<br>gods. He will also acquire all kinds of celestial weapons, and this bull<br>among men will also retrieve the fortunes of his race.'<br><br>'Kunti heard these extraordinary words, while lying in the room. And<br>hearing those words uttered so loudly, the ascetics dwelling on the<br>mountain of a hundred peaks, and the celestials with Indra sitting in<br>their cars, became exceedingly glad. The sounds of the (invisible) drum<br>filled the entire welkin. There were shouts of joy, and the whole region<br>was covered with flowers showered down by invisible agents. The various<br>tribes of celestials assembled together, began to offer their respectful<br>adorations to the son of Pritha. The sons of Kadru (Nagas), the son of<br>Vinata, the Gandharvas, the lords of the creation, and the seven great<br>Rishis, viz., Bharadwaja, Kasyapa, Gautama, Viswamitra, Jamadagni,<br>Vasishtha, and the illustrious Atri who illumined the world of old when<br>the Sun was lost, all came there. And Marichi, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha,<br>Kratu, Daksha the lord of creation, the Gandharvas, and Apsaras, came<br>there also. The various tribes of Apsaras, decked with celestial garlands<br>and every ornament, and attired in fine robes, came there and danced in<br>joy, chanting the praises of Vibhatsu (Arjuna). All around, the great<br>Rishis began to utter propitiatory formulas. And Tumvuru accompanied by<br>the Gandharvas began to sing in charming notes. And Bhimasena and<br>Ugrasena, Urnayus and Anagha. Gopati and Dhritarashtra and Suryavarchas<br>the eighth, Yugapa and Trinapa, Karshni, Nandi, and Chitraratha,<br>Salisirah the thirteenth, Parjanya the fourteenth, Kali the fifteenth,<br>and Narada the sixteenth in this list, Vrihatta, Vrihaka, Karala of great<br>soul, Brahmacharin, Vahuguna, Suvarna of great fame, Viswavasu, Bhumanyu,<br>Suchandra, Sam and the celebrated tribes of Haha and Huhu gifted with<br>wonderful melody of voice,&#8212;these celestial Gandharvas, O king, all went<br>there. Many illustrious Apsaras also of large eyes, decked with every<br>ornament came there to dance and sing. And Anuchana and Anavadya,<br>Gunamukhya and Gunavara, Adrika and Soma, Misrakesi and Alambusha,<br>Marichi and Suchika, Vidyutparna and Tilottama and Ambika, Lakshmana,<br>Kshema Devi, Rambha, Manorama, Asita, Suvahu, Supriya, Suvapuh,<br>Pundarika, Sugandha, Surasa, Pramathini, Kamya and Saradwati, all danced<br>there together. And Menaka, Sahajanya, Karnika, Punjikasthala,<br>Ritusthala, Ghritachi, Viswachi, Purvachiti, the celebrated Umlocha,<br>Pramlocha the tenth and Urvasi the eleventh,&#8212;these large-eyed dancing<br>girls of heaven,&#8212;came there and sang in chorus. And Dharti and Aryaman<br>and Mitra and Varuna, Bhaga and Indra, Vivaswat, Pushan, Tvastri and<br>Parjanya or Vishnu, these twelve Adityas came there to glorify Pandu's<br>son. And, O king, Mrigavyadha, Sarpa, the celebrated Niriti, Ajaikapada,<br>Ahivradhna, Pinakin, Dahana, Iswara, Kapalin, Sthanu and the illustrious<br>Bhaga&#8212;these eleven Rudras,&#8212;also came there. And the twin Aswins, the<br>eight Vasus, the mighty Maruts, the Viswedevas, and the Sadhyas, also<br>came there. And Karkotaka, Vasuki, Kachchhapa, Kunda and the great Naga<br>Takshaka,&#8212;these mighty and wrathful snakes possessed of high ascetic<br>merit also came there. And Tarkshya, Arishtanemi, Garuda,<br>Asitadvaja,&#8212;these and many other Nagas, came there, so also Aruna and<br>Aruni of Vinata's race also came there. And only great Rishis crowned<br>with ascetic success and not others saw those celestials and other beings<br>seated in their cars or waiting on the mountain peaks. Those best of<br>Munis beholding that wonderful sight, became amazed, and their love and<br>affection for the children of Pandu was in consequence enhanced.<br><br>"The celebrated Pandu, tempted by the desire of having more children<br>wished to speak again unto his wedded wife (for invoking some other god).<br>But Kunti addressed him, saying, 'The wise do not sanction a fourth<br>delivery even in a season of distress. The woman having intercourse with<br>four different men is called a Swairini (heanton), while she having<br>intercourse with five becometh a harlot. Therefore, O learned one, as<br>thou art well-acquainted with the scripture on this subject, why dost<br>thou, beguiled by desire of offspring, tell me so in seeming<br>forgetfulness of the ordinance?'"
