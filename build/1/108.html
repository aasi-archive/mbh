                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus asked, the tiger among Munis then answered<br>those Rishis of ascetic wealth, 'Whom shall I blame for this? In fact,<br>none else (than my own self) hath offended against me!' After this, O<br>monarch, the officers of justice, seeing him alive, informed the king of<br>it. The latter hearing what they said, consulted with his advisers, and<br>came to the place and began to pacify the Rishi. fixed on the stake. And<br>the king said, 'O thou best of Rishis, I have offended against thee in<br>ignorance. I beseech thee to pardon me for the same. It behoveth thee not<br>to be angry with me.' Thus addressed by the king, the Muni was pacified.<br>And beholding him free from wrath, the king took him up with the stake<br>and endeavoured to extract it from his body. But not succeeding therein,<br>he cut it off at the point just outside the body. The Muni, with a<br>portion of the stake within his body, walked about, and in that state<br>practised the austerest of penances and conquered numberless regions<br>unattainable by others. And for the circumstances of a part of the stake<br>being within his body, he came to be known in the three worlds by the<br>name of Ani-Mandavya (Mandavya with the stake within). And one day that<br>Brahamana acquainted with the highest truth of religion went unto the<br>abode of the god of justice. And beholding the god there seated on his<br>throne, the Rishi reproached him and said, 'What, pray, is that sinful<br>act committed by me unconsciously, for which I am bearing this<br>punishment? O, tell me soon, and behold the power of my asceticism.'<br><br>"The god of justice, thus questioned, replied, 'O thou of ascetic wealth,<br>a little insect was once pierced by thee on a blade of grass. Thou<br>bearest now the consequence of the act. O Rishi, as a gift, however<br>small, multiplieth in respect of its religious merits, so a sinful act<br>multiplieth in respect of the woe it bringeth in its train.' On hearing<br>this, Ani-Mandavya asked, 'O tell me truly when this act was committed by<br>me. Told in reply by the god of justice that he had committed it, when a<br>child, the Rishi said, 'That shall not be a sin which may be done by a<br>child up to the twelfth year of his age from birth. The scriptures shall<br>not recognise it as sinful. The punishment thou hast inflicted on me for<br>such a venial offence hath been disproportionate in severity. The killing<br>of a Brahmana involves a sin that is heavier than the killing of any<br>other living being. Thou shall, therefore, O god of justice, have to be<br>born among men even in the Sudra order. And from this day I establish<br>this limit in respect of the consequence of acts that an act shall not be<br>sinful when committed by one below the age of fourteen. But when<br>committed by one above that age, it shall be regarded as sin.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Cursed for this fault by that illustrious<br>Rishi, the god of justice had his birth as Vidura in the Sudra order. And<br>Vidura was well-versed in the doctrines of morality and also politics and<br>worldly profit. And he was entirely free from covetousness and wrath.<br>Possessed of great foresight and undisturbed tranquillity of mind, Vidura<br>was ever devoted to the welfare of the Kurus.'"
