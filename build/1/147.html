                            (Jatugriha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Meanwhile the Pandavas got into their cars, yoking<br>thereto some fine horses endued with the speed of wind. While they were<br>on the point of entering their cars, they touched, in great sorrow, the<br>feet of Bhishma, of king Dhritarashtra, of the illustrious Drona, of<br>Kripa, of Vidura and of the other elders of the Kuru race. Then saluting<br>with reverence all the older men, and embracing their equals, receiving<br>the farewell of even the children, and taking leave of all the venerable<br>ladies in their household, and walking round them respectfully, and<br>bidding farewell unto all the citizens, the Pandavas, ever mindful of<br>their vows, set out for Varanavata. And Vidura of great wisdom and the<br>other bulls among the Kurus and the citizens also, from great affliction,<br>followed those tigers among men to some distance. And some amongst the<br>citizens and the country people, who followed the Pandavas, afflicted<br>beyond measure at beholding the sons of Pandu in such distress, began to<br>say aloud, 'King Dhritarashtra of wicked soul seeth no things with the<br>same eye. The Kuru monarch casteth not his eye on virtue. Neither the<br>sinless Yudhishthira, nor Bhima the foremost of mighty men, nor<br>Dhananjaya the (youngest) son of Kunti, will ever be guilty (of the sin<br>of waging a rebellious war). When these will remain quiet, how shall the<br>illustrious son of Madri do anything? Having inherited the kingdom from<br>their father, Dhritarashtra could not bear them. How is that Bhishma who<br>suffers the exile of the Pandavas to that wretched place, sanctions this<br>act of great injustice? Vichitravirya, the son of Santanu, and the royal<br>sage Pandu of Kuru's race both cherished us of old with fatherly care.<br>But now that Pandu that tiger among men, hath ascended to heaven,<br>Dhritarashtra cannot bear with these princes his children. We who do not<br>sanction this exile shall all go, leaving this excellent town and our own<br>homes, where Yudhishthira will go.'<br><br>"Unto those distressed citizens talking in this way, the virtuous<br>Yudhishthira, himself afflicted with sorrow, reflecting for a few moments<br>said, 'The king is our father, worthy of regard, our spiritual guide, and<br>our superior. To carry out with unsuspicious hearts whatever he biddeth,<br>is indeed, our duty. Ye are our friends. Walking round us and making us<br>happy by your blessings, return ye to your abodes. When the time cometh<br>for anything to be done for us by you, then, indeed, accomplish all that<br>is agreeable and beneficial to us.' Thus addressed, the citizens walked<br>round the Pandavas and blessed them with their blessings and returned to<br>their respective abodes.<br><br>"And after the citizens had ceased following the Pandavas, Vidura,<br>conversant with all the dictates of morality, desirous of awakening the<br>eldest of the Pandavas (to a sense of his dangers), addressed him in<br>these words. The learned Vidura, conversant with the jargon (of the<br>Mlechchhas), addressed the learned Yudhishthira who also was conversant<br>with the same jargon, in the words of the Mlechchha tongue, so as to be<br>unintelligible to all except Yudhishthira. He said, 'He that knoweth the<br>schemes his foes contrive in accordance with the dictates of political<br>science, should, knowing them, act in such a way as to avoid all danger.<br>He that knoweth that there are sharp weapons capable of cutting the body<br>though not made of steel, and understandeth also the means of warding<br>them off, can never be injured by foes. He liveth who protecteth himself<br>by the knowledge that neither the consumer of straw and wood nor the<br>drier of the dew burneth the inmates of a hole in the deep woods. The<br>blind man seeth not his way: the blind man hath no knowledge of<br>direction. He that hath no firmness never acquireth prosperity.<br>Remembering this, be upon your guard. The man who taketh a weapon not<br>made of steel (i.e., an inflammable abode) given him by his foes, can<br>escape from fire by making his abode like unto that of a jackal (having<br>many outlets). By wandering a man may acquire the knowledge of ways, and<br>by the stars he can ascertain the direction, and he that keepeth his five<br>(senses) under control can never be oppressed y his enemies.'<br><br>"Thus addressed, Pandu's son, Yudhishthira the just replied unto Vidura,<br>that foremost of all learned men, saying, 'I have understood thee.' Then<br>Vidura, having instructed the Pandavas and followed them (thus far),<br>walked around them and bidding them farewell returned to his own abode.<br>When the citizens and Bhishma and Vidura had all ceased following, Kunti<br>approached Yudhishthira and said, 'The words that Kshattri said unto thee<br>in the midst of many people so indistinctly as if he did not say<br>anything, and thy reply also to him in similar words and voice, we have<br>not understood. If it is not improper; for us to know them I should then<br>like to hear everything that had passed between him and thee.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira replied, 'The virtuous Vidura said unto me that we should<br>know that the mansion (for our accommodation at Varanavata) hath been<br>built of inflammable materials. He said unto me, 'The path of escape too<br>shall not be unknown to thee,'&#8212;and further,&#8212;'Those that can control<br>their senses can acquire the sovereignty of the whole world.'&#8212;The reply<br>that I gave unto Vidura was, 'I have understood thee.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The Pandavas set out on the eighth day of the<br>month of Phalguna when the star Rohini was in the ascendant, and arriving<br>at Varanavata they beheld the town and the people.'"
