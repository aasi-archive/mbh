                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'At the very touch by Garuda of great might with his feet,<br>the branch of the tree broke as it was caught by Garuda. Casting his eyes<br>around in wonder he saw Valakhilya Rishis hanging therefrom with heads<br>downwards and engaged in ascetic penances. Reflecting that if that bough<br>fell down, the Rishis would be slain, the mighty one held the elephant<br>and the tortoise still more firmly with his claws. And from fear of<br>slaying the Rishis and desire of saving them, held that bough in his<br>beaks, and rose on his wings. The great Rishis were struck with wonder at<br>the sight of that act of his which was beyond even the power of the gods,<br>and gave that mighty bird a name. And they said, 'As this ranger of the<br>skies rises on its wings bearing a heavy burden, let this foremost of<br>birds having snakes for his food be called Garuda (bearer of heavy<br>weight).'<br><br>"And shaking the mountains by his wings, Garuda leisurely coursed through<br>the skies. And as he soared with the elephant and the tortoise (in his<br>claws), he beheld various regions underneath. Desiring as he did to save<br>the Valakhilyas, he saw not a spot whereon to sit. At last he went to<br>that foremost of mountains called Gandhamadana. There he saw his father<br>Kasyapa engaged in ascetic devotions. Kasyapa also saw his son, that<br>ranger of the skies, of divine form, possessed of great splendour, and<br>energy and strength, and endued with the speed of the wind or the mind,<br>huge as a mountain peak, a ready smiter like the curse of a Brahmana,<br>inconceivable, indescribable, frightful to all creatures, possessed of<br>great prowess, terrible, of the splendour of Agni himself, and incapable<br>of being overcome by the deities, Danavas, and invincible Rakshasas,<br>capable of splitting mountain summits and sucking the ocean itself and<br>destroying the three worlds, fierce, and looking like Yama himself. The<br>illustrious Kasyapa, seeing him approach and knowing also his motive,<br>spoke unto him these words:<br><br>"Kasyapa said, 'O child, do not commit a rash act, for then thou wouldst<br>have to suffer pain. The Valakhilyas, supporting themselves by drinking<br>the rays of the sun, might, if angry, blast thee.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Kasyapa then propitiated, for the sake of his son, the<br>Valakhilyas of exceeding good fortune and whose sins had been destroyed<br>by ascetic penances.' And Kasyapa said, 'Ye whose wealth is asceticism,<br>the essay of Garuda is for the good of all creatures. The task is great<br>that he is striving to accomplish. It behoveth you to accord him your<br>permission.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Those ascetics thus addressed by the illustrious<br>Kasyapa, abandoned that bough and went to the sacred mountain of Himavat<br>for purposes of ascetic penances. After those Rishis had gone away, the<br>son of Vinata, with voice obstructed by the bough in his beaks, asked his<br>father Kasyapa saying, 'O illustrious one, where shall I throw this arm<br>of the tree? O illustrious one, indicate to me some region without human<br>beings.' Then Kasyapa spoke of a mountain without human beings with caves<br>and dales always covered with snow and incapable of approach by ordinary<br>creatures even in thought. And the great bird bearing that branch, that<br>elephant, and that tortoise, proceeded with great speed towards that<br>mountain. The great arm of the tree with which that bird of huge body<br>flew away could not be girt round with a cord made of a hundred (cow)<br>hides. Garuda, the lord of birds, then flew away for hundreds of thousand<br>of yojanas within&#8212;the shortest time. And going according to the<br>directions of his father to that mountain almost in a moment, that ranger<br>of the skies let fall the gigantic bough. And it fell with a great noise.<br>And that Prince of mountains shook, struck with the storm raised by<br>Garuda's wings. And the trees thereon dropped showers of flowers. And the<br>peaks decked with gems and gold adorning that great mountain itself, were<br>loosened and tell down on all sides. And the falling bough struck down<br>numerous trees which, with golden flowers amid dark foliage, shone there<br>like clouds charged with lightning. And those trees, bright as gold,<br>falling down upon the ground and, dyed with mountain metals, shone as if<br>they were bathed in the rays of the sun.<br><br>"Then that best of birds, Garuda, perching on the summit of that<br>mountain, ate both the elephant and the tortoise, rose on his wings with<br>great speed from the top of the mountain.<br><br>"And various omens began to appear among the gods foreboding fear.<br>Indra's favourite thunderbolt blazed up in a fright. Meteors with flames<br>and smoke, loosened from the welkin, shot down during the day. And the<br>weapons of the Vasus, the Rudras, the Adityas, the Sabhyas, the Maruts,<br>and other gods, began to spend their force against one another. Such a<br>thing had never happened even during the war between the gods and the<br>Asuras. And the winds blew accompanied with thunder, and meteors fell by<br>thousands. And the sky, though cloudless, roared tremendously. And even<br>he who was the god of gods shed showers of blood. And the flowery<br>garlands on the necks of the gods faded and their prowess suffered<br>diminution. And terrible masses of clouds dropped thick showers of blood.<br>And the dust raised by the winds darkened the splendour of the very<br>coronets of the gods. And He of a thousand sacrifices (Indra), with the<br>other gods, perplexed with fear at the sight of those dark forebodings<br>spoke unto Vrihaspati thus, 'Why, O worshipful one, have these natural<br>disturbances suddenly arisen? No foe do I behold who would oppress us in<br>war.' Vrihaspati answered, 'O chief of the gods, O thou of a thousand<br>sacrifices, it is from thy fault and carelessness, and owing also to the<br>ascetic penance of the high-souled great Rishis, the Valakhilyas, that<br>the son of Kasyapa and Vinata, a ranger of the skies endued with great<br>strength and possessing the capacity of assuming at will any form, is<br>approaching to take away the Soma. And that bird, foremost among all<br>endued with great strength, is able to rob you of the Soma. Everything is<br>possible with him; the unachievable he can achieve.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Indra, having heard these words, then spoke unto those<br>that guarded the amrita, saying, 'A bird endued with great strength and<br>energy has set his heart on taking away the amrita. I warn you beforehand<br>so that he may not succeed in taking it away by force. Vrihaspati has<br>told me that his strength is immeasurable.' And the gods hearing of it<br>were amazed and took precautions. And they stood surrounding the amrita<br>and Indra also of great prowess, the wielder of the thunder, stood with<br>them. And the gods wore curious breastplates of gold, of great value, and<br>set with gems, and bright leathern armour of great toughness. And the<br>mighty deities wielded various sharp-edged weapons of terrible shapes,<br>countless in number, emitting, even all of them, sparks of fire with<br>smoke. And they were also armed with many a discus and iron mace<br>furnished with spikes, and trident, battle-axe, and various kinds of<br>sharp-pointed missiles and polished swords and maces of terrible form,<br>all befitting their respective bodies. And decked with celestial<br>ornaments and resplendent with those bright arms, the gods waited there,<br>their fears allayed. And the gods, of incomparable strength, energy, and<br>splendour, resolved to protect the amrita. Capable of splitting the towns<br>of the Asuras, all displayed themselves in forms resplendent as the fire.<br>And in consequence of the gods standing there, that (would be)<br>battle-field, owing to hundreds of thousands of maces furnished with iron<br>spikes, shone like another firmament illumined by the rays of the Sun.'"<br><br>So ends the thirtieth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.
