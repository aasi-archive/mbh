                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>'Sauti continued, 'The ministers said, 'That king of kings then, spent<br>with hunger and exertion, and having placed the snake upon the shoulders<br>of that Muni, came back to his capital. The Muni had a son, born of a<br>cow, of the name of Sringin. He was widely known, possessed of great<br>prowess and energy, and very wrathful. Going (every day) to his preceptor<br>he was in the habit of worshipping him. Commanded by him, Sringin was<br>returning home, when he heard from a friend of his about the insult of<br>his father by thy parent. And, O tiger among kings, he heard that his<br>father, without having committed any fault, was bearing, motionless like<br>a statue, upon his shoulders a dead snake placed thereon. O king, the<br>Rishi insulted by thy father was severe in ascetic penances, the foremost<br>of Munis, the controller of passions, pure, and ever engaged in wonderful<br>acts. His soul was enlightened with ascetic penances, and his organs and<br>their functions were under complete control. His practices and his speech<br>were both very nice. He was contented and without avarice. He was without<br>meanness of any kind and without envy. He was old and used to observe the<br>vow of silence. And he was the refuge whom all creatures might seek in<br>distress.<br><br>"Such was the Rishi insulted by thy father. The son, however, of that<br>Rishi, in wrath, cursed thy father. Though young in years, the powerful<br>one was old in ascetic splendour. Speedily touching water, he spake,<br>burning as it were with spiritual energy and rage, these words in<br>allusion to thy father, 'Behold the power of my asceticism! Directed by<br>my words, the snake Takshaka of powerful energy and virulent poison,<br>shall, within seven nights hence, burn, with his poison the wretch that<br>hath placed the dead snake upon my un-offending father.' And having said<br>this, he went to where his father was. And seeing his father he told him<br>of his curse. The tiger among Rishis thereupon sent to thy father a<br>disciple of his, named Gaurmukha, of amiable manners and possessed of<br>every virtue. And having rested a while (after arrival at court) he told<br>the king everything, saying in the words of his master, 'Thou hast been<br>cursed, O king, by my son. Takshaka shall burn thee with his poison!<br>Therefore, O king, be careful.' O Janamejaya, hearing those terrible<br>words, thy father took every precaution against the powerful snake<br>Takshaka.<br><br>"And when the seventh day had arrived, a Brahmana Rishi, named Kasyapa,<br>desired to come to the monarch. But the snake Takshaka saw Kasyapa. And<br>the prince of snakes spake unto Kasyapa without loss of time, saying,<br>'Where dost thou go so quickly, and what is the business on which thou<br>goest?' Kasyapa replied, saying, 'O Brahmana, I am going whither king<br>Parikshit, that best of the Kurus, is. He shall today be burnt by the<br>poison of the snake Takshaka. I go there quickly in order to cure him, in<br>fact, in order that, protected by me, the snake may not bite him to<br>death.' Takshaka answered, saying, 'Why dost thou seek to revive the king<br>to be bitten by me? I am that Takshaka. O Brahmana, behold the wonderful<br>power of my poison. Thou art incapable of reviving that monarch when bit<br>by me.' So saying, Takshaka, then and there, bit a lord of the forest (a<br>banian tree). And the banian, as soon as it was bit by the snake, was<br>converted into ashes. But Kasyapa, O king, revived it. Takshaka thereupon<br>tempted him, saying, 'Tell me thy desire.' And Kasyapa, too, thus<br>addressed, spake again unto Takshaka, saying, 'I go there from desire of<br>wealth.' And Takshaka, thus addressed, then spake unto the high-souled<br>Kasyapa in these soft words, 'O sinless one, take from me more wealth<br>than what thou expectest from that monarch, and go back!' And Kasyapa,<br>that foremost of men, thus addressed by the snake, and receiving from him<br>as much wealth as he desired, wended his way back.<br><br>"And Kasyapa going back, Takshaka, approaching in disguise, blasted, with<br>the fire of his poison, thy virtuous father, the first of kings, then<br>staying in his mansion with all precautions. And after that, thou wast, O<br>tiger among men, been installed (on the throne). And, O best of monarchs,<br>we have thus told thee all that we have seen and heard, cruel though the<br>account is. And hearing all about the discomfiture of thy royal father,<br>and of the insult to the Rishi Utanka, decide thou that which should<br>follow!<br><br>'Sauti continued, 'King Janamejaya, that chastiser of enemies, then spake<br>upto all his ministers. And he said, 'When did ye learn all that happened<br>upon that, banian reduced to ashes by Takshaka, and which, wonderful as<br>it is, was afterwards revived by Kasyapa? Assuredly, my father could not<br>have died, for the poison could have been neutralised by Kasyapa with his<br>mantras. That worst of snakes, of sinful soul, thought within his mind<br>that if Kasyapa resuscitated the king bit by him, he, Takshaka, would be<br>an object of ridicule in the world owing to the neutralisation of his<br>poison. Assuredly, having thought so, he pacified the Brahmana. I have<br>devised a way, however, of inflicting punishment upon him. I like to<br>know, however, what ye saw or heard, what happened in the deep solitude<br>of the forest,&#8212;viz., the words of Takshaka and the speeches of Kasyapa.<br>Having known it, I shall devise the means of exterminating the snake<br>race.'<br><br>"The ministers said, 'Hear, O monarch of him who told us before of the<br>meeting between that foremost Brahmana and that prince of snakes in the<br>woods. A certain person, O monarch, had climbed up that tree containing<br>some dry branches with the object of breaking them for sacrificial fuel.<br>He was not perceived either by the snake or by the Brahmana. And, O king,<br>that man was reduced to ashes along with the tree itself. And, O king of<br>kings, he was revived with the tree by the power of the Brahmana. That<br>man, a Brahmana's menial, having come to us, represented fully everything<br>as it happened between Takshaka and the Brahmana. Thus have we told thee,<br>O king, all that we have seen and heard. And having heard it, O tiger<br>among kings, ordain that which should follow.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'King Janamejaya, having listened to the words of his<br>ministers, was sorely afflicted with grief, and began to weep. And the<br>monarch began to squeeze his hands. And the lotus-eyed king began to<br>breathe a long and hot breath, shed tears, and shrieked aloud. And<br>possessed with grief and sorrow, and shedding copious tears, and touching<br>water according to the form, the monarch spake. And reflecting for a<br>moment, as if settling something in his mind, the angry monarch,<br>addressing all ministers, said these words.<br><br>'I have heard your account of my father's ascension to heaven. Know ye<br>now what my fixed resolve is. I think no time must be lost in avenging<br>this injury upon the wretch Takshaka that killed my father. He burnt my<br>father making Sringin only a secondary cause. From malignity alone he<br>made Kasyapa return. If that Brahmana had arrived, my father assuredly<br>would have lived. What would he have lost if the king had revived by the<br>grace of Kasyapa and the precautionary measures of his ministers? From<br>ignorance of the effects of my wrath, he prevented Kasyapa&#8212;that<br>excellent of Brahmanas&#8212;whom he could not defeat, from coming to my<br>father with the desire of reviving him. The act of aggression is great on<br>the part of the wretch Takshaka who gave wealth unto that Brahmana in<br>order that he might not revive the king. I must now avenge myself on my<br>father's enemy to please myself, the Rishi Utanka and you all.'"
