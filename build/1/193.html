                            (Swayamvara Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then those illustrious sons of Pritha, on returning<br>to the potter's abode, approached their mother. And those first of men<br>represented Yajnaseni unto their mother as the alms they had obtained<br>that day. And Kunti who was there within the room and saw not her sons,<br>replied, saying, 'Enjoy ye all (what ye have obtained).' The moment<br>after, she beheld Krishna and then she said, 'Oh, what have I said?' And<br>anxious from fear of sin, and reflecting how every one could be<br>extricated from the situation, she took the cheerful Yajnaseni by the<br>hand, and approaching Yudhishthira said, 'The daughter of king Yajnasena<br>upon being represented to me by thy younger brothers as the alms they had<br>obtained, from ignorance, O king, I said what was proper, viz., 'Enjoy ye<br>all what hath been obtained. O thou bull of the Kuru race, tell me how my<br>speech may not become untrue; how sin may not touch the daughter of the<br>king of Panchala, and how also she may not become uneasy.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by his mother that hero among<br>men, that foremost scion of the Kuru race, the intelligent king<br>(Yudhishthira), reflecting for a moment, consoled Kunti, and addressing<br>Dhananjaya, said, 'By thee, O Phalguna, hath Yajnaseni been won. It is<br>proper, therefore, that thou shouldst wed her. O thou withstander of all<br>foes, igniting the sacred fire, take thou her hand with due rites.'<br><br>"Arjuna, hearing this, replied, 'O king, do not make me a participator in<br>sin. Thy behest is not conformable to virtue. That is the path followed<br>by the sinful. Thou shouldst wed first, then the strong-armed Bhima of<br>inconceivable feats, then myself, then Nakula, and last of all, Sahadeva<br>endued with great activity. Both Vrikodara and myself, and the twins and<br>this maiden also, all await, O monarch, thy commands. When such is the<br>state of things, do that, after reflection, which would be proper, and<br>conformable virtue, and productive of fame, and beneficial unto the king<br>of Panchala. All of us are obedient to thee. O, command us as thou<br>likest.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of Jishnu, so full of<br>respect and affection, the Pandavas all cast their eyes upon the princess<br>of Panchala. And the princess of Panchala also looked at them all. And<br>casting their glances on the illustrious Krishna, those princes looked at<br>one another. And taking their seats, they began to think of Draupadi<br>alone. Indeed, after those princes of immeasurable energy had looked at<br>Draupadi, the God of Desire invaded their hearts and continued to crush<br>all their senses. As the lavishing beauty of Panchali who had been<br>modelled by the Creator himself, was superior to that of all other women<br>on earth, it could captivate the heart of every creature. And<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, beholding his younger brothers,<br>understood what was passing in their minds. And that bull among men<br>immediately recollected the words of Krishna-Dwaipayana. And the king,<br>then, from fear of a division amongst the brothers, addressing all of<br>them, said, 'The auspicious Draupadi shall be the common wife of us all.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The sons of Pandu, then, hearing those words of<br>their eldest brother, began to revolve them in their minds in great<br>cheerfulness. The hero of the Vrishni race (Krishna suspecting the five<br>persons he had seen at the Swayamvara to be none else than the heroes of<br>the Kuru race), came accompanied by the son of Rohini (Valadeva), to the<br>house of the potter where those foremost of men had taken up their<br>quarters. On arriving there, Krishna and Valadeva beheld seated in that<br>potter's house Ajatasanu (Yudhishthira) of well developed and long arms,<br>and his younger brothers passing the splendour of fire sitting around<br>him. Then Vasudeva approaching that foremost of virtuous men&#8212;the son of<br>Kunti&#8212;and touching the feet of that prince of the Ajamida race, said, 'I<br>am Krishna.' And the son of Rohini (Valadeva) also approaching<br>Yudhishthira, did the same. And the Pandavas, beholding Krishna and<br>Valadeva, began to express great delight. And, O thou foremost of the<br>Bharata race, those heroes of the Yadu race thereafter touched also the<br>feet of Kunti, their father's sister. And Ajatasatru, that foremost of<br>the Kuru race, beholding Krishna, enquired after his well-being and<br>asked, 'How, O Vasudeva, hast thou been able to trace us, as we are<br>living in disguise?' And Vasudeva, smilingly answered, 'O king, fire,<br>even if it is covered, can be known. Who else among men than the Pandavas<br>could exhibit such might? Ye resisters of all foes, ye sons of Pandu, by<br>sheer good fortune have ye escaped from that fierce fire. And it is by<br>sheer good fortune alone that the wicked son of Dhritarashtra and his<br>counsellors have not succeeded in accomplishing their wishes. Blest be<br>ye! And grow ye in prosperity like a fire in a cave gradually growing and<br>spreading itself all around. And lest any of the monarchs recognise ye,<br>let us return to our tent.' Then, obtaining Yudhishthira's leave, Krishna<br>of prosperity knowing no decrease, accompanied by Valadeva, hastily went<br>away from the potter's abode.'"
