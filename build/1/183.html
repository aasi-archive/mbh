                            (Chaitraratha Parva continued)<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'The Brahmana sage (Parasara) thus addressed by<br>the illustrious Vasishtha restrained his wrath from destroying the<br>worlds. But the Rishi Parasara endued with great energy&#8212;the son of<br>Saktri&#8212;the foremost of all persons acquainted with the Vedas&#8212;performed<br>a grand Rakshasa sacrifice. And remembering the slaughter of (his father)<br>Saktri, the great Muni began to consume the Rakshasas, young and old, in<br>the sacrifice he performed. And Vasishtha did not restrain him from this<br>slaughter of the Rakshasa, from the determination of not obstructing this<br>second vow (of his grandson). And in that sacrifice the great Muni<br>Parasara sat before three blazing fires, himself like unto a fourth fire.<br>And the son of Saktri, like the Sun just emerging from the clouds,<br>illuminated the whole firmament by that stainless sacrifice of his into<br>which large were the libations poured of clarified butter. Then Vasishtha<br>and the other Rishis regarded that Muni blazing with his own energy as if<br>he were the second Sun. Then the great Rishi Atri of liberal soul<br>desirous of ending that sacrifice, an achievement highly difficult for<br>others,&#8212;came to that place. And there also came, O thou slayer of all<br>foes, Pulastya and Pulaha, and Kratu the performer of many great<br>sacrifices, all influenced by the desire of saving the Rakshasas. And, O<br>thou bull of the Bharata race, Pulastya then, seeing that many Rakshasas<br>had already been slain, told these words unto Parasara that oppressor of<br>all enemies:<br><br>'There is no obstruction, I hope, to this sacrifice of thine, O child!<br>Takest thou any pleasure, O child, in this slaughter of even all those<br>innocent Rakshasas that know nothing of thy father's death. It behoveth<br>thee not to destroy any creatures thus. This, O child, is not the<br>occupation of a Brahmana devoted to asceticism. Peace is the highest<br>virtue. Therefore, O Parasara, establish thou peace. How hast thou, O<br>Parasara, being so superior, engaged thyself in such a sinful practice?<br>It behoveth not thee to transgress against Saktri himself who was<br>well-acquainted with all rules of morality. It behoveth not thee to<br>extirpate any creatures. O descendant of Vasishtha's race, that which<br>befell thy father was brought about by his own curse. It was for his own<br>fault that Saktri was taken hence unto heaven. O Muni, no Rakshasa was<br>capable of devouring Saktri; he himself provided for his own death. And,<br>O Parasara, Viswamitra was only a blind instrument in that matter. Both<br>Saktri and Kalmashapada, having ascended to heaven are enjoying great<br>happiness. And, the other sons also of the great Rishi Vasishtha who were<br>younger than Saktri, are even now enjoying themselves with the<br>celestials. And, O child, O offspring of Vasishtha's son, thou hast also<br>been, in this sacrifice, only an instrument in the destruction of these<br>innocent Rakshasas. O, blest be thou! Abandon this sacrifice of thine.<br>Let it come to an end.'<br><br>"The Gandharva continued, 'Thus addressed by Pulastya, as also by the<br>intelligent Vasishtha, that mighty Muni&#8212;the son of Saktri then brought<br>that sacrifice to an end. And the Rishi cast the fire that he had ignited<br>for the purpose of the Rakshasas' sacrifice into the deep woods on the<br>north of the Himavat. And that fire may be seen to this day consuming<br>Rakshasas and trees and stones in all seasons.'"
