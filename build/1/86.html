                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'King Yayati, the son of Nahusha, having thus<br>installed his dear son on the throne, became exceedingly happy, and<br>entered into the woods to lead the life of a hermit. And having lived for<br>some time into forest in the company of Brahmanas, observing many rigid<br>vows, eating fruits and roots, patiently bearing privations of all sorts,<br>the monarch at last ascended to heaven. And having ascended to heaven he<br>lived there in bliss. But soon, however, he was hurled down by Indra. And<br>it hath been heard by me, O king, that, though hurled from heaven,<br>Yayati, without reaching the surface of the Earth, stayed in the<br>firmament. I have heard that some time after he again entered the region<br>of the celestials in company with Vasuman, Ashtaka, Pratarddana, and<br>Sivi.'<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'I desire to hear from thee in detail why Yayati,<br>having first obtained admission into heaven, was hurled therefrom, and<br>why also he gained re-admittance. Let all this, O Brahmana, be narrated<br>by thee in the presence of these regenerate sages. Yayati, lord of Earth,<br>was, indeed, like the chief of the celestials. The progenitor of the<br>extensive race of the Kurus, he was of the splendour of the Sun. I desire<br>to hear in full the story of his life both in heaven and on Earth, as he<br>was illustrious, and of world-wide celebrity and of wonderful<br>achievements.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Indeed, I shall recite to thee the excellent story<br>of Yayati's adventures on Earth and in heaven. That story is sacred and<br>destroyeth the sins of those that hear it.<br><br>"King Yayati, the son of Nahusha, having installed his youngest son,<br>Puru, on the throne after casting his sons with Yadu for their eldest<br>amongst the Mlechchhas, entered the forest to lead the life of a hermit.<br>And the king eating fruits and roots lived for some time in the forest.<br>Having his mind and passions under complete control, the king gratified<br>by sacrifices the Pitris and the gods. And he poured libations of<br>clarified butter upon the fire according to the rites prescribed for<br>those leading the Vanaprastha mode of life. And the illustrious one<br>entertained guests and strangers with the fruit of the forest and<br>clarified butter, while he himself supported life by gleaning scattered<br>corn seeds. And the king; led this sort of life for a full thousand<br>years. And observing the vow of silence and with mind under complete<br>control he passed one full year, living upon air alone and without sleep.<br>And he passed another year practising the severest austerities in the<br>midst of four fires around and the Sun overhead. And, living upon air<br>alone, he stood erect upon one leg for six months. And the king of sacred<br>deeds ascended to heaven, covering heaven as well as the Earth (with the<br>fame of his achievements).'"
