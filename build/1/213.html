                            (Rajya-labha Parva continued)<br><br>"Narada continued, 'Then the celestial Rishis, the Siddhas, and the<br>high-souled Rishis possessing the attributes of tranquillity and<br>self-restraint, beholding that act of universal slaughter, were afflicted<br>with great grief. With passions and senses and souls under complete<br>control, they then went to the abode of the Grandsire, moved by<br>compassion for the universe. Arrived there, they beheld the Grandsire<br>seated with gods, Siddhas, and Brahmarshis around him. There were present<br>that God of gods, viz., Mahadeva, and Agni, accompanied by Vayu, and Soma<br>and Surya and Sakra, and Rishis devoted to the contemplation of Brahma,<br>and the Vaikhanasas, the Valakhilyas, the Vanaprasthas, the Marichipas,<br>the Ajas, the Avimudas, and other ascetics of great energy. All those<br>Rishis were sitting with the Grandsire, when the celestial and other<br>Rishis, approaching Brahman with sorrowful hearts, represented unto him<br>all the acts of Sunda and Upasunda. And they told the Grandsire in detail<br>everything that the Asura brothers had done, and how they had done it,<br>and in what order. Then all the celestials and the great Rishis pressed<br>the matter before the Grandsire. The Grandsire, hearing everything they<br>said, reflected for a moment and settled in his mind what he should do.<br>Resolving to compass the destruction of the Asura brothers, he summoned<br>Viswakarman (the celestial architect). Seeing Viswakarman before him, the<br>Grandsire possessed of supreme ascetic merit commanded him, saying,<br>'Create thou a damsel capable of captivating all hearts.' Bowing down<br>unto the Grandsire and receiving his command with reverence, the great<br>artificer of the universe created a celestial maiden with careful<br>attention. Viswakrit first collected all handsome features upon the body<br>of the damsel he created. Indeed, the celestial maiden that he created<br>was almost a mass of gems. And created with great care by Viswakarman,<br>the damsel, in beauty, became unrivalled among the women of the three<br>worlds. There was not even a minute part of her body which by its wealth<br>of beauty could not attract the gaze of beholders. And like unto the<br>embodied Sri herself, that damsel of extraordinary beauty captivated the<br>eyes and hearts of every creature. And because she had been created with<br>portions of every gem taken in minute measures, the Grandsire bestowed<br>upon her the name of Tilottama. And as soon as he started it into life,<br>the damsel bowed to Brahman and with joined palms said, 'Lord of every<br>created thing, what task am I to accomplish and what have I been created<br>for?' The Grandsire answered, 'Go, O Tilottama, unto the Asuras, Sunda<br>and Upasunda. O amiable one, tempt them with thy captivating beauty. And,<br>O damsel, conduct thyself there in such a way that the Asura brothers<br>may, in consequence of the wealth of thy beauty, quarrel with each other<br>as soon as they cast their eyes upon thee.'<br><br>"Narada continued, 'Bowing unto the Grandsire and saying, 'So be<br>it,'&#8212;the damsel walked round the celestial conclave. The illustrious<br>Brahman was then sitting with face turned eastwards, and Mahadeva with<br>face also towards the east, and all the celestials with faces northwards,<br>and the Rishis with faces towards all directions. While Tilottama walked<br>round the conclave of the celestials, Indra and the illustrious Sthanu<br>(Mahadeva) were the only ones that succeeded in preserving their<br>tranquillity of mind. But exceedingly desirous as Mahadeva was (of<br>beholding Tilottama) when the damsel (in her progress round the celestial<br>conclave) was at his side, another face like a full-blown lotus appeared<br>on the southern side of his body. And when she was behind him, another<br>face appeared on the west. And when the damsel was on the northern side<br>of the great god, a fourth face appeared on the northern side of his<br>body. Mahadeva (who was eager to behold the damsel) came also to have a<br>thousand eyes, each large and slightly reddish, before, behind and on his<br>flanks. And it was thus that Sthanu the great god came to have four<br>faces, and the slayer of Vala, a thousand eyes. And as regards the mass<br>of the celestials and the Rishis, they turned their faces towards all<br>directions as Tilottama walked round them. Except the divine Grandsire<br>himself, the glances of those illustrious personages, even of all of them<br>fell upon Tilottama's body. And when Tilottama set out (for the city of<br>the Asuras) with the wealth of her beauty, all regarded the task as<br>already accomplished. After Tilottama had gone away, the great god who<br>was the First Cause of the Universe, dismissed all the celestials and the<br>Rishis.'"
