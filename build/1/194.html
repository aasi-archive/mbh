                            (Swayamvara Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'When the Kuru princes (Bhima and Arjuna) were<br>wending towards the abode of the potter, Dhrishtadyumna, the Panchala<br>prince followed them. And sending away all his attendants, he concealed<br>himself in some part of the potter's house, unknown to the Pandavas. Then<br>Bhima, that grinder of all foes, and Jishnu, and the illustrious twins,<br>on returning from their eleemosynary round in the evening, cheerfully<br>gave everything unto Yudhishthira. Then the kind-hearted Kunti addressing<br>the daughter of Drupada said, 'O amiable one, take thou first a portion<br>from this and devote it to the gods and give it away to Brahmanas, and<br>feed those that desire to eat and give unto those who have become our<br>guests. Divide the rest into two halves. Give one of these unto Bhima, O<br>amiable one, for this strong youth of fair complexion&#8212;equal unto a king<br>of elephants&#8212;this hero always eateth much. And divide the other half<br>into six parts, four for these youths, one for myself, and one for thee.'<br>Then the princess hearing those instructive words of her mother-in-law<br>cheerfully did all that she had been directed to do. And those heroes<br>then all ate of the food prepared by Krishna. Then Sahadeva, the son of<br>Madri, endued with great activity, spread on the ground a bed of kusa<br>grass. Then those heroes, each spreading thereon his deer-skin, laid<br>themselves down to sleep. And those foremost of the Kuru princes lay down<br>with heads towards the south. And Kunti laid herself down along the line<br>of their heads, and Krishna along that of their feet. And Krishna though<br>she lay with the sons of Pandu on that bed of kusa grass along the line<br>of their feet as if she were their nether pillow, grieved not in her<br>heart nor thought disrespectfully of those bulls amongst the Kurus. Then<br>those heroes began to converse with one another. And the conversations of<br>those princes, each worthy to lead an army, was exceedingly interesting<br>they being upon celestial cars and weapons and elephants, and swords and<br>arrows, and battle-axes. And the son of the Panchala king listened (from<br>his place of concealment) unto all they said. And all those who were with<br>him beheld Krishna in that state.<br><br>"When morning came, the prince Dhristadyumna set out from his place of<br>concealment with great haste in order to report to Drupada in detail all<br>that had happened at the potter's abode and all that he had heard those<br>heroes speak amongst themselves during the night. The king of Panchala<br>had been sad because he knew not the Pandavas as those who had taken away<br>his daughter. And the illustrious monarch asked Dhristadyumna on his<br>return, 'Oh, where hath Krishna gone? Who hath taken her away? Hath any<br>Sudra or anybody of mean descent, or hath a tribute-paying Vaisya by<br>taking my daughter away, placed his dirty foot on my head? O son, hath<br>that wreath of flowers been thrown away on a grave-yard? Hath any<br>Kshatriya of high birth, or any one of the superior order (Brahmana)<br>obtained my daughter? Hath any one of mean descent, by having won<br>Krishna, placed his left foot on my head? I would not, O son, grieve but<br>feel greatly happy, if my daughter hath been united with Partha that<br>foremost of men! O thou exalted one, tell me truly who hath won my<br>daughter today? O, are the sons of that foremost of Kurus,<br>Vichitravirya's son alive? Was it Partha (Arjuna) that took up the bow<br>and shot the mark?'"
