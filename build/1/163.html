                            (Vaka-vadha Parva continued)<br><br>"Kunti said, Grieve not at all, O Brahmana, on account of this danger. I<br>see a way by which to rescue thee from that Rakshasa. Thou hast only one<br>son, who, besides, is of very tender years, also only one daughter, young<br>and helpless, so I do not like that any of these, or thy wife, or even<br>thyself should go unto the Rakshasa. I have five sons, O Brahmana, let<br>one of them go, carrying in thy behalf tribute of that Rakshasa.'<br><br>"Hearing this, the Brahmana replied, 'To save my own life I shall never<br>suffer this to be done. I shall never sacrifice, to save myself, the life<br>of a Brahmana or of a guest. Indeed, even those that are of low origin<br>and of sinful practices refuse to do (what thou askest me to do). It is<br>said that one should sacrifice one's self and one's offspring for the<br>benefit of a Brahmana. I regard this advice excellent and I like to<br>follow it too. When I have to choose between the death of a Brahmana and<br>that of my own, I would prefer the latter. The killing of a Brahmana is<br>the highest sin, and there is no expiation for it. I think a reluctant<br>sacrifice of one's own self is better than the reluctant sacrifice of a<br>Brahmana. O blessed lady, in sacrificing myself I do not become guilty of<br>self-destruction. No sin can attach to me when another will take my life.<br>But if I deliberately consent to the death of a Brahmana, it would be a<br>cruel and sinful act, from the consequence of which there is no escape.<br>The learned have said that the abandonment of one who hath come to thy<br>house or sought thy protection, as also the killing of one who seeketh<br>death at thy hands, is both cruel and sinful. The illustrious among those<br>conversant with practices allowable in seasons of distress, have before<br>now said that one should never perform an act that is cruel and<br>censurable. It is well for me that I should today perish myself with my<br>wife, but I would never sanction the death of a Brahmana.'<br><br>"Kunti said, 'I too am firmly of opinion, O Brahmana, that Brahmanas<br>should ever be protected. As regards myself, no son of mine would be less<br>dear to me even if I had a hundred instead of the five I have. But this<br>Rakshasa will not be able to kill my son, for that son of mine is endued<br>with great prowess and energy, and skilled in mantras. He will faithfully<br>deliver to the Rakshasa his food, but will, I know to a certainty, rescue<br>himself. I have seen before many mighty Rakshasas of huge bodies engaged<br>in combat with my heroic son and killed too by him. But, O Brahmana, do<br>not disclose this fact to anybody, for if it be known, persons desirous<br>of obtaining this power, will, from curiosity, always trouble my sons.<br>The wise have said that if my son imparteth any knowledge, without the<br>assent of his preceptor, unto any person, my son himself will no longer<br>be able to profit by that knowledge.'<br><br>"Thus addressed by Pritha, the Brahmana with his wife became exceedingly<br>glad and assented to Kunti's speech, which was unto them as nectar. Then<br>Kunti, accompanied by the Brahmana, went unto the son of Vayu (Bhima) and<br>asked him to accomplish (that difficult task). Bhima replied unto them,<br>saying, 'So be it.'"
