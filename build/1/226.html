                            (Khandava-daha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then Havyavahana (Agni) in anger and disappointment,<br>with his ailment uncured, went back to the Grandsire. And he represented<br>unto Brahman all that had happened: The illustrious deity, reflecting for<br>a moment, said unto him, 'O sinless one. I see a way by which thou mayest<br>consume the forest of Khandava today in the very sight of Indra. Those<br>old deities, Nara and Narayana, have become incarnate in the world of men<br>to accomplish the business of the celestials. They are called on earth<br>Arjuna and Vasudeva. They are even now staying in the forest of Khandava.<br>Solicit them for aiding thee in consuming that forest. Thou shalt then<br>consume the forest even if it be protected by the celestials. They will<br>certainly prevent the population of Khandava from escaping, and thwart<br>Indra also (in aiding any one in the escape). I have no doubt of this!'<br>Hearing these words, Agni came in haste unto Krishna and Partha. O king,<br>I have already told thee what he said, having approached the illustrious<br>pair. O tiger among kings, hearing those words of Agni who was desirous<br>of consuming the forest of Khandava against the will of Indra, Vibhatsu<br>said unto him these words well-suited to the occasion, I have numberless<br>excellent celestial weapons with which I can fight even many wielders of<br>the thunderbolt. But, O exalted one, I have no bow suited to the strength<br>of my arms, and capable of bearing the might I may put forth in battle.<br>In consequence of the lightness of my hands also I require arrows that<br>must never be exhausted. My car also is scarcely able to bear load of<br>arrows that I would desire to keep by me. I desire celestial steeds of<br>pure white, possessing the speed of the wind; and a car possessing the<br>splendour of the sun and the clatter of whose wheels should resemble the<br>roar of the clouds. Then, there is no weapon suited to Krishna's energy<br>and with which Madhava can slay Nagas and Pisachas. O exalted one, it<br>behoveth thee to give us the means by which success may be achieved and<br>by which we may thwart Indra in pouring his showers upon that extensive<br>forest. O Pavaka, we are ready to do all that manliness and prowess can<br>do. But, O exalted one, it behoveth thee to give us the adequate means.'"
