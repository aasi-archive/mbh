                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Then the snake-dame Jaratkaru, calling her own son, told<br>him the following words according to the directions of Vasuki, the king<br>of the snakes. 'O son, the time is come for the accomplishment of that<br>object for which I was bestowed on thy father by my brother. Therefore,<br>do thou that which should be done.'<br><br>"Astika asked, 'Why wert thou, O mother, bestowed on my father by my<br>uncle? Tell me all truly so that on hearing it, I may do what is proper.'<br><br>"Then Jaratkaru, the sister of the king of the snakes, herself unmoved by<br>the general distress, and even desirous of the welfare of her relatives,<br>said unto him, 'O son, it is said that the mother of all the snakes is<br>Kadru. Know thou why she cursed in anger her sons.' Addressing the snakes<br>she said, 'As ye have refused to falsely represent Uchchaihsravas, the<br>prince of horses, for bringing about Vinata's bondage according to the<br>wager, therefore, shall he whose charioteer is Vayu burn you all in<br>Janamejaya's sacrifice. And perishing in that sacrifice, ye shall go to<br>the region of the unredeemed spirits.' The Grandsire of all the worlds<br>spake unto her while uttering this curse, 'Be it so,' and thus approved<br>of her speech. Vasuki, having heard that curse and then the words of the<br>Grandsire, sought the protection of the gods, O child, on the occasion<br>when the amrita was being churned for. And the gods, their object<br>fulfilled, for they had obtained the excellent amrita, with Vasuki ahead,<br>approached the Grandsire. And all the gods, with king Vasuki, sought to<br>incline Him who was born of the lotus to be propitious, so that the curse<br>might be made abortive.'<br><br>"And the gods said, 'O Lord, Vasuki, the king of the snakes, is sorry on<br>account of his relatives. How may his mother's curse prove abortive?'<br><br>"Brahman thereupon replied, saying, 'Jaratkaru will take unto himself a<br>wife of the name of Jaratkaru; the Brahmana born of her will relieve the<br>snakes.'<br><br>"Vasuki, the best of snakes, hearing those words, bestowed me, O thou of<br>godlike looks, on thy high-souled father some time before the<br>commencement of the sacrifice. And from that marriage thou art born of<br>me. That time has come. It behoveth thee to protect us from this danger.<br>It behoveth thee to protect my brother and myself from the fire, so that<br>the object, viz., our relief, for which I was bestowed on thy wise<br>father, may not be unfulfilled. What dost thou think, O son?'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Thus addressed, Astika said unto his mother, 'Yes, I<br>will.' And he then addressed the afflicted Vasuki, and as if infusing<br>life into him, said, 'O Vasuki, thou best of snakes, thou great being,<br>truly do I say, I shall relieve thee from that curse. Be easy, O snake!<br>There is no fear any longer. I shall strive earnestly so that good may<br>come! Nobody hath ever said that my speech, even in jest, hath proved<br>false. Hence on serious occasions like this, I need not say anything<br>more, O uncle, going thither today I shall gratify, with words mixed with<br>blessings, the monarch Janamejaya installed at the sacrifice, so that, O<br>excellent one, the sacrifice may stop. O highminded one, O king of the<br>snakes, believe all that I say. Believe me, my resolve can never be<br>unfulfilled.'<br><br>"And Vasuki then said, 'O Astika, my head swims and my heart breaks. I<br>cannot discern the points of the earth, as I am afflicted with a mother's<br>curse.'<br><br>"And Astika said, 'Thou best of snakes, it behoveth thee not to grieve<br>any longer. I shall dispel this fear of thine from the blazing fire. This<br>terrible punishment, capable of burning like the fire at the end of the<br>Yuga, I shall extinguish. Nurse not thy fear any longer.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'Then that best of Brahmanas, Astika, quelling the<br>terrible fear of the Vasuki's heart, and taking it, as it were, on<br>himself, wended, for the relief of the king of the snakes, with speed to<br>Janamejaya's sacrifice blessed with every merit. And Astika having gone<br>thither, beheld the excellent sacrificial compound with numerous Sadasyas<br>on it whose splendour was like unto that of the Sun or Agni. But that<br>best of Brahmanas was refused admittance by the door-keepers. And the<br>mighty ascetic gratified them, being desirous of entering the sacrificial<br>compound. And that best of Brahmanas, that foremost of all virtuous men,<br>having entered the excellent sacrificial compound, began to adore the<br>king of infinite achievements, Ritwiks, the Sadasyas, and also the sacred<br>fire.'"
