                            (Arjuna-vanavasa Parva)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'The Pandavas, having established such a rule,<br>continued to reside there. By the prowess of their arms they brought many<br>kings under their sway. And Krishna became obedient unto all the five<br>sons of Pritha, those lions among men, of immeasurable energy. Like the<br>river Saraswati decked with elephants, which again take pleasure in that<br>stream, Draupadi took great delight in her five heroic husbands and they<br>too took delight in her. And in consequence of the illustrious Pandavas<br>being exceedingly virtuous in their practice, the whole race of Kurus,<br>free from sin, and happy, grew in prosperity.<br><br>"After some time, O king, it so happened that certain robbers lifted the<br>cattle of a Brahmana, and while they were carrying away the booty, the<br>Brahmana, deprived of his senses by anger, repaired to Khandavaprastha,<br>and began to reprove the Pandavas in accents of woe. The Brahmana said,<br>'Ye Pandavas, from this your dominion, my kine are even now being taken<br>away by force by despicable and wicked wretches! Pursue ye the thieves.<br>Alas, the sacrificial butter of a peaceful Brahmana is being taken away<br>by crows! Alas, the wretched jackal invadeth the empty cave of a lion! A<br>king that taketh the sixth part of the produce of the land without<br>protecting the subject, hath been called by the wise to be the most<br>sinful person in the whole world. The wealth of a Brahmana is being taken<br>away by robbers! Virtue itself is sustaining a diminution! Take me up by<br>the hand, ye Pandavas for I am plunged in grief!"<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, heard those<br>accents of the Brahmana weeping in bitter grief. As soon as he heard<br>those accents, he loudly assured the Brahmana, saying, 'No fear!' But it<br>so happened that the chamber where the illustrious Pandavas had their<br>weapons was then occupied by Yudhishthira the just with Krishna. Arjuna,<br>therefore, was incapable of entering it or, going alone with the<br>Brahmana, though repeatedly urged (to do either) by the weeping accents<br>of the Brahmana. Summoned by the Brahmana, Arjuna reflected, with a<br>sorrowful heart, Alas, this innocent Brahmana's wealth is being robbed! I<br>should certainly dry up his tears. He hath come to our gate, and is<br>weeping even now. If I do not protect him, the king will be touched with<br>sin in consequence of my indifference; our own irreligiousness will be<br>cited throughout the kingdom, and we shall incur a great sin. If,<br>disregarding the king, I enter the chamber, without doubt I shall be<br>behaving untruthfully towards the monarch without a foe. By entering the<br>chamber, again, I incur the penalty of an exile in the woods. But I must<br>overlook everything. I care not if I have to incur sin by disregarding<br>the king. I care not if I have to go to the woods and die there. Virtue<br>is superior to the body and lasteth after the body hath perished!'<br>Dhananjaya, arriving at this resolution, entered the chamber and talked<br>with Yudhishthira. Coming out with the bow, he cheerfully told the<br>Brahmana, 'Proceed, O Brahmana, with haste, so that those wretched<br>robbers may not go much ahead of us. I shall accompany thee and restore<br>unto thee thy wealth that hath fallen into the hands of the thieves.'<br>Then Dhananjaya, capable of using both his arms with equal skill, armed<br>with the bow and cased in mail and riding in his war-chariot decked with<br>a standard, pursued the thieves, and piercing them with his arrows,<br>compelled them to give up the booty. Benefiting the Brahmana thus by<br>making over to him his kine, and winning great renown, the hero returned<br>to the capital. Bowing unto all the elders, and congratulated by<br>everybody, Partha at last approached Yudhishthira, and addressing him,<br>said, 'Give me leave, O lord, to observe the vow I took. In beholding<br>thee sitting with Draupadi, I have violated the rule established by<br>ourselves. I shall therefore go into the woods, for this is even our<br>understanding.' Then Yudhishthira, suddenly hearing those painful words,<br>became afflicted with grief, and said in an agitated voice, 'Why!' A<br>little while after, king Yudhishthira in grief said unto his brother<br>Dhananjaya of curly hair who never departed from his vows, these words,<br>'O sinless one, if I am an authority worthy of regard, listen to what I<br>say. O hero, full well do I know the reason why thou hadst entered my<br>chamber and didst what thou regardest to be an act disagreeable to me.<br>But there is no displeasure in my mind. The younger brother may, without<br>fault, enter the chamber where the elder brother sitteth with his wife.<br>It is only the elder brother that acts against the rules of propriety by<br>entering the room where the younger brother sitteth with his wife.<br>Therefore, O thou of mighty arms, desist from thy purpose. Do what I say.<br>Thy virtue hath sustained no diminution. Thou hast not disregarded me.'<br><br>"Arjuna, hearing this, replied, 'I have heard, even from thee, that<br>quibbling is not permitted in the discharge of duty. I cannot waver from<br>truth. Truth is my weapon.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Obtaining then the king's permission, Arjuna<br>prepared himself for a forest-life; and he went to the forest to live<br>there for twelve years.'"
