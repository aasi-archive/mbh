                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Saunaka said, 'O Sauti, relate once more in detail this history of the<br>learned and virtuous Astika. Our curiosity for hearing it is great. O<br>amiable one, thou speakest sweetly, with proper accent and emphasis; and<br>we are well-pleased with thy speech. Thou speakest even as thy father.<br>Thy sire was ever ready to please us. Tell us now the story as thy father<br>had related it.'<br><br>"Sauti said, 'O thou that art blest with longevity, I shall narrate the<br>history of Astika as I heard it from my father. O Brahmana, in the golden<br>age, Prajapati had two daughters. O sinless one, the sisters were endowed<br>with wonderful beauty. Named Kadru and Vinata, they became the wives of<br>Kasyapa. Kasyapa derived great pleasure from his two wedded wives and<br>being gratified he, resembling Prajapati himself, offered to give each of<br>them a boon. Hearing that their lord was willing to confer on them their<br>choice blessings, those excellent ladies felt transports of joy. Kadru<br>wished to have for sons a thousand snakes all of equal splendour. And<br>Vinata wished to bring forth two sons surpassing the thousand offsprings<br>of Kadru in strength, energy, size of body, and prowess. Unto Kadru her<br>lord gave that boon about a multitude of offspring. And unto Vinata also,<br>Kasyapa said, 'Be it so!' Then Vinata, having; obtained her prayer,<br>rejoiced greatly. Obtaining two sons of superior prowess, she regarded<br>her boon fulfilled. Kadru also obtained her thousand sons of equal<br>splendour. 'Bear the embryos carefully,' said Kasyapa, and then he went<br>into the forest, leaving his two wives pleased with his blessings.'<br><br>"Sauti continued, 'O best of regenerate ones, after a long time, Kadru<br>brought forth a thousand eggs, and Vinata two. Their maid-servants<br>deposited the eggs separately in warm vessels. Five hundred years passed<br>away, and the thousand eggs produced by Kadru burst and out came the<br>progeny. But the twins of Vinata did not appear. Vinata was jealous, and<br>therefore she broke one of the eggs and found in it an embryo with the<br>upper part developed but the lower one undeveloped. At this, the child in<br>the egg became angry and cursed his mother, saying. 'Since thou hast<br>prematurely broken this egg, thou shall serve as a slave. Shouldst thou<br>wait five hundred years and not destroy, or render the other egg<br>half-developed, by breaking it through impatience, then the illustrious<br>child within it will deliver thee from slavery! And if thou wouldst have<br>the child strong, thou must take tender care of the egg for all this<br>time!' Thus cursing his mother, the child rose to the sky. O Brahmana,<br>even he is the charioteer of Surya, always seen in the hour of morning!<br><br>"Then at the expiration of the five hundred years, bursting open the<br>other egg, out came Garuda, the serpent-eater. O tiger of Bhrigu's race,<br>immediately on seeing the light, that son of Vinata left his mother. And<br>the lord of birds, feeling hungry, took wing in quest of the food<br>assigned to him by the Great Ordainer of all.".<br><br>So ends the sixteenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.
