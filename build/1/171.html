                            (Chaitraratha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Kunti spoke unto Bhimasena and Arjuna and<br>the twins regarding the journey to Panchala. They all said, 'So be it.'<br>Then, O king, Kunti with her sons saluted the Brahmana (in whose house<br>they had dwelt) and set out for the delightful town of the illustrious<br>Drupada.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'While the illustrious Pandavas were living disguised<br>in the abode of the Brahmana, Vyasa, the son of Satyavati, once went to<br>see them. Those chastisers of foes, beholding him coming rose up and<br>stepped onward to receive him. Saluting him reverentially and worshipping<br>him also the Pandavas stood in silence with joined hands. Thus worshipped<br>by them the sage became gratified. He asked them to be seated, and<br>cheerfully addressing them said, 'Ye slayers of foes, are ye living in<br>the path of virtue and according to the scriptures? Do ye worship the<br>Brahmanas? Ye are not, I hope, backward in paying homage unto those that<br>deserve your homage?' The illustrious Rishi, after this, spoke many words<br>of virtuous import, and after discoursing upon many topics of great<br>interest, he said, 'An illustrious Rishi, living in a certain hermitage,<br>had a daughter of tender waist, fair lips, and fine eye-brows, and<br>possessing every accomplishment. As a consequence of her own acts (in a<br>past life) the fair maid became very unfortunate. Though chaste and<br>beautiful, the damsel obtained not a husband. With a sorrowful heart she<br>thereupon began to practise ascetic penances with the object of obtaining<br>a husband. She soon gratified by her severe asceticism the god Sankara<br>(Mahadeva), who became propitious unto her and said unto that illustrious<br>damsel, 'Ask thou the boon thou desirest! Blest be thou! I am Sankara<br>prepared to give thee what thou wilt ask.' Desirous of benefiting<br>herself, the maid repeatedly said unto the supreme lord, 'O give me, a<br>husband endued with every accomplishment.' Then Isana (Mahadeva), that<br>foremost of all speakers, replied unto her, saying, 'O blessed one, thou<br>shall have five husbands from among the Bharata princes.' Thus told, the<br>maiden said unto the god who had given her that boon, 'O lord, I desire<br>to have only one husband through thy grace.' The god then addressed her<br>again and said these excellent words, 'Thou hast, O girl, said full five<br>times, 'Give me (a) husband.' Thou shalt, therefore, in another life have<br>five husbands!' Ye princes of Bharata's line, that damsel of celestial<br>beauty hath been born in the line of Drupada. The faultless Krishna of<br>Prishata's line hath been appointed to be the wife of you all. Ye mighty<br>ones, go therefore, to the capital of the Panchalas and dwell ye there.<br>There is no doubt that having obtained her as wife ye shall be very<br>happy.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said so unto the Pandavas, the<br>illustrious and blessed grandsire then bade them farewell. The great<br>ascetic then left them and went to the place whence he had come.'"
