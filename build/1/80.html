                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then Kavya, the foremost of Bhrigu's line, became<br>angry himself. And approaching Vrishaparvan where the latter was seated,<br>began to address him without weighing his words, 'O king,' he said,<br>'sinful acts do not, like the Earth, bear fruit immediately! But<br>gradually and secretly do they extirpate their doers. Such fruit visiteth<br>either in one's own self, one's son, or one's grandson. Sins must bear<br>their fruit. Like rich food they can never be digested. And because ye<br>slew the Brahmana Kacha, the grandson of Angiras, who was virtuous,<br>acquainted with the precepts of religion, and attentive to his duties,<br>while residing in my abode, even for this act of slaughter&#8212;and for the<br>mal-treatment of my daughter too, know, O Vrishaparvan, I shall leave<br>thee and thy relatives! Indeed, O king, for this, I can no longer stay<br>with thee! Dost thou, O Asura chief, think that I am a raving liar? Thou<br>makest light of thy offence without seeking to correct it!'.<br><br>"Vrishaparvan then said, 'O son of Bhrigu, never have I attributed want<br>of virtue, of falsehood, to thee. Indeed, virtue and truth ever dwell in<br>thee. Be kind to me! O Bhargava, if, leaving us, thou really goest hence,<br>we shall then go into the depths of the ocean. Indeed, there is nothing<br>else for us to do.'<br><br>"Sukra then replied, 'Ye Asuras, whether ye go into the depths of the<br>ocean or fly away to all directions. I care little. I am unable to bear<br>my daughter's grief. My daughter is ever dear to me. My life dependeth on<br>her. Seek ye to please her. As Vrihaspati ever seeketh the good of Indra,<br>so do I always seek thine by my ascetic merits.'<br><br>"Vrishaparvan then said, 'O Bhargava, thou art the absolute master of<br>whatever is possessed by the Asura chiefs in this world-their elephants,<br>kine and horses, and even my humble self!'<br><br>"Sukra then answered, 'If it is true, O great Asura, that I am the lord<br>of all the wealth of the Asuras, then go and gratify Devayani.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'when the great Kavya was so addressed by<br>Vrishaparvan, he then went to Devayani and told her all. Devayani,<br>however, quickly replied, 'O Bhargava, if thou art truly the lord of the<br>Asura king himself and of all his wealth, then let the king himself come<br>to me and say so in my presence.' Vrishaparvan then approached Devayani<br>and told her, 'O Devayani of sweet smiles, whatever thou desirest I am<br>willing to give thee, however difficult it may be to grant the same.'<br>Devayani answered, 'I desire Sarmishtha with a thousand maids to wait on<br>me! She must also follow me to where my father may give me away.'<br><br>"Vrishaparvan then commanded a maid-servant in attendance on him, saying,<br>'Go and quickly bring Sarmishtha hither. Let her also accomplish what<br>Devayani wisheth.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The maid-servant then repaired to Sarmishtha<br>and told her, 'O amiable Sarmishtha, rise and follow me. Accomplish the<br>good of thy relatives. Urged by Devayani, the Brahmana (Sukra) is on the<br>point of leaving his disciples (the Asuras). O sinless one, thou must do<br>what Devayani wisheth.' Sarmishtha replied, 'I shall cheerfully do what<br>Devayani wisheth. Urged by Devayani Sukra is calling me. Both Sukra and<br>Devayani must not leave the Asuras through my fault.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Commanded by her father, then, Sarmishtha,<br>accompanied by a thousand maidens, soon came, in a palanquin, out of her<br>father's excellent mansion. And approaching Devayani she said, 'With my<br>thousand maids, I am thy waiting-maid! And I shall follow thee where thy<br>father may give thee away.' Devayani replied, 'I am the daughter of one<br>who chanteth the praises of thy father, and who beggeth and accepteth<br>alms; thou, on the other hand, art the daughter of one who is adored. How<br>canst thou be my waiting-maid?'<br><br>"Sarmishtha answered, 'One must by all means contribute to the happiness<br>of one's afflicted relatives. Therefore shall I follow thee wherever thy<br>father may give thee away.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'When Sarmishtha thus promised to be Devayani's<br>waiting-maid the latter, O king, then spoke unto her father thus, 'O best<br>of all excellent Brahmanas, I am gratified. I shall now enter the Asura<br>capital! I now know that thy science and power of knowledge are not<br>futile!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'That best of Brahmanas, of great reputation,<br>thus addressed by his daughter, then, entered the Asura capital in the<br>gladness of his heart. And the Danavas worshipped him with great<br>reverence.'"
