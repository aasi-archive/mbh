                            (Khandava-daha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Mandapala then addressed his children, saying, 'I<br>had spoken unto Agni for the safety of you all. The illustrious deity had<br>assured me that he would grant my wish. At those words of Agni, and<br>knowing the virtuous disposition of your mother, as also the great energy<br>that is in yourselves, I came not here earlier. Therefore, ye sons, do<br>not harbour in your hearts any resentment towards me. Ye are all Rishis<br>acquainted with the Vedas. Even Agni knoweth you well.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having given such assurances unto his sons, the<br>Brahmana Mandapala took with him his wife and sons, and leaving that<br>region, went away to some other country.<br><br>"It was thus that the illustrious god of fierce rays, having grown in<br>strength consumed the forest of Khandava with the help of Krishna and<br>Arjuna, for the good of the world. And Agni having drunk several rivers<br>of fat and marrow, became highly gratified, and showed himself to Arjuna.<br>Then Purandara, surrounded by the Maruts, descended from the firmament<br>and addressing Partha and Kesava said, 'Ye have achieved a feat that a<br>celestial even could not. Ask ye each a boon that is not obtainable by<br>any man. I have been gratified with you.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Partha asked from Indra all his weapons.<br>At this Sakra of great splendour, having fixed the time for giving them,<br>said, 'When the illustrious Madhava becomes pleased with thee, then, O<br>son of Pandu, I will give thee all my weapons! O prince of Kuru's race, I<br>shall know when the time cometh. Even for thy austere asceticism I will<br>give thee all my weapons of fire and all my Vayavya weapons, and thou<br>also wilt accept them all of me.' Then Vasudeva asked that his friendship<br>with Arjuna might be eternal. The chief of the celestials granted unto<br>the intelligent Krishna the boon he desired. And having granted these<br>boons unto Krishna and Arjuna, the lord of the Maruts, accompanied by the<br>celestials, ascended to heaven, having also spoken to Hutasana (one whose<br>food is sacrificial butter). Agni also, having burnt that forest with its<br>animals and birds for five and ten days, became gratified and ceased to<br>burn. Having eaten flesh in abundance and drunk fat and blood, he became<br>highly gratified, and addressing Achyuta and Arjuna said, 'I have been<br>gratified by you two tigers among men. At my command, ye heroes, ye shall<br>be competent to go wheresoever ye choose!' Thus addressed by the<br>illustrious Agni, Arjuna and Vasudeva and the Danava Maya also&#8212;these<br>three,&#8212;having wandered a little at last sat themselves down on the<br>delightful banks of a river.'"<br><br>END OF ADI PARVA
