                            (Adivansavatarana Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Bowing down in the first place to my preceptor with<br>the eight parts of my body touching the ground, with devotion and<br>reverence, and with all my heart, worshipping the whole assembly of<br>Brahmanas and other learned persons, I shall recite in full what I have<br>heard from the high-souled and great Rishi Vyasa, the first of<br>intelligent men in the three worlds. And having got it within thy reach,<br>O monarch, thou also art a fit person to hear the composition called<br>Bharata. Encouraged by the command of my preceptor my heart feeleth no<br>fear.<br><br>"Hear, O monarch, why that disunion occurred between the Kurus and the<br>Pandavas, and why also that exile into the woods immediately proceeding<br>from the game at dice prompted by the desire (of the Kurus) for rule. I<br>shall relate all to thee who askest it thou best of the Bharata race!<br><br>"On the death of their father those heroes (the Pandavas) came to their<br>own home. And within a short time they became well-versed in archery. And<br>the Kurus beholding the Pandavas gifted with physical strength, energy,<br>and power of mind, popular also with the citizens, and blessed with good<br>fortune, became very jealous. Then the crookedminded Duryodhana, and<br>Karna, with (the former's uncle) the son of Suvala began to persecute<br>them and devise means for their exile. Then the wicked Duryodhana, guided<br>by the counsels of Sakuni (his maternal uncle), persecuted the Pandavas<br>in various ways for the acquirement of undisputed sovereignty. The wicked<br>son of Dhritarashtra gave poison to Bhima, but Bhima of the stomach of<br>the wolf digested the poison with the food. Then the wretch again tied<br>the sleeping Bhima on the margin of the Ganges and, casting him into the<br>water, went away. But when Bhimasena of strong arms, the son of Kunti<br>woke, he tore the strings with which he had been tied and came up, his<br>pains all gone. And while asleep and in the water black snakes of<br>virulent poison bit him in every part of his body. But that slayer of<br>foes did not still perish. And in all those persecutions of the Pandavas<br>by their cousins, the Kurus, the high-minded Vidura attentively engaged<br>himself neutralising those evil designs and rescuing the persecuted ones.<br>And as Sakra from the heavens keeps in happiness the world of men, so did<br>Vidura always keep the Pandavas from evil.<br><br>"When Duryodhana, with various means, both secret and open, found himself<br>incapable of destroying the Pandavas who were protected by the fates and<br>kept alive for grave future purposes (such as the extermination of the<br>Kuru race), then called together his counsellors consisting of Vrisha<br>(Karna), Duhsasana and others, and with the knowledge of Dhritarashtra<br>caused a house of lac to be constructed. And king Dhritarashtra, from<br>affection for his children, and prompted by the desire of sovereignty,<br>sent the Pandavas tactfully into Varanavata. And the Pandavas then went<br>away with their mother from Hastinapura. And when they were leaving the<br>city, Vidura gave them some idea of impending danger and how they could<br>come out of it.<br><br>'The sons of Kunti reached the town of Varanavata and lived there with<br>their mother. And, agreeably to the command of Dhritarashtra, those<br>illustrious slayers of all enemies lived in the palace of lac, while in<br>that town. And they lived in that place for one year, protecting<br>themselves from Purochana very wakefully. And causing a subterranean<br>passage to be constructed, acting according to the directions of Vidura,<br>they set fire to that house of lac and burnt Purochana (their enemy and<br>the spy of Duryodhana) to death. Those slayers of all enemies, anxious<br>with fear, then fled with their mother. In the woods beside a fountain<br>they saw a Rakshasa. But, alarmed at the risk they ran of exposure by<br>such an act the Pandavas fled in the darkness, out of fear from the sons<br>of Dhritarashtra. It was here that Bhima gained Hidimva (the sister of<br>the Rakshasa he slew) for a wife, and it was of her that Ghatotkacha was<br>born. Then the Pandavas, of rigid vows, and conversant with the Vedas<br>wended to a town of the name of Ekachakra and dwelt there in the guise of<br>Brahmacharins. And those bulls among men dwelt in that town in the house<br>of a Brahmana for some time, with temperance and abstinence. And it was<br>here that Bhima of mighty arms came upon a hungry and mighty and<br>man-eating Rakshasa of the name of Vaka. And Bhima, the son of Pandu,<br>that tiger among men, slew him speedily with the strength of his arms and<br>made the citizens safe and free from fear. Then they heard of Krishna<br>(the princess of Panchala) having become disposed to select a husband<br>from among the assembled princes. And, hearing of it, they went to<br>Panchala, and there they obtained the maiden. And having obtained<br>Draupadi (as their common wife) they then dwelt there for a year. And<br>after they became known, those chastisers of all enemies went back to<br>Hastinapura. And they were then told by king Dhritarashtra and the son of<br>Santanu (Bhishma) as follows: 'In order, O dear ones, dissensions may not<br>take place between you and your cousins, we have settled that<br>Khandavaprastha should be your abode. Therefore, go ye, casting off all<br>jealousy, to Khandavaprastha which contains many towns served by many<br>broad roads, for dwelling there.' And accordingly the Pandavas went, with<br>all their friends and followers, to Khandavaprastha taking with them many<br>jewels and precious stones. And the sons of Pritha dwelt there for many<br>years. And they brought, by force of arms, many a prince under their<br>subjection. And thus, setting their hearts on virtue and firmly adhering<br>to truth, unruffled by affluence, calm in deportment, and putting down<br>numerous evils, the Pandavas gradually rose to power. And Bhima of great<br>reputation subjugated the East, the heroic Arjuna, the North, Nakula, the<br>West; Sahadeva that slayer of all hostile heroes, the South. And this<br>having been done, their domination was spread over the whole world. And<br>with the five Pandavas, each like unto the Sun, the Earth looked as if<br>she had six Suns.<br><br>"Then, for some reason, Yudhishthira the just, gifted with great energy<br>and prowess, sent his brother Arjuna who was capable of drawing the bow<br>with the left hand, dearer unto him than life itself, into the woods. And<br>Arjuna, that tiger among men, of firm soul, and gifted with every virtue,<br>lived in the woods for eleven years and months. And during this period,<br>on a certain occasion, Arjuna went to Krishna in Dwaravati. And Vibhatsu<br>(Arjuna) there obtained for a wife the lotus-eyed and sweet-speeched<br>younger sister of Vasudeva, Subhadra by name. And she became united, in<br>gladness, with Arjuna, the son of Pandu, like Sachi with the great Indra,<br>or Sri with Krishna himself. And then, O best of monarchs, Arjuna, the<br>son of Kunti, with Vasudeva, gratified Agni; the carrier of the<br>sacrificial butter, in the forest of Khandava (by burning the medicinal<br>plants in that woods to cure Agni of his indigestion). And to Arjuna,<br>assisted as he was by Kesava, the task did not at all appear heavy even<br>as nothing is heavy to Vishnu with immense design and resources in the<br>matter of destroying his enemies. And Agni gave unto the son of Pritha<br>the excellent bow Gandiva and a quiver that was inexhaustible, and a<br>war-chariot bearing the figure of Garuda on its standard. And it was on<br>this occasion that Arjuna relieved the great Asura (Maya) from fear (of<br>being consumed in the fire). And Maya, in gratitude, built (for the<br>Pandavas) a celestial palace decked with every sort of jewels and<br>precious stones. And the wicked Duryodhana, beholding that building, was<br>tempted with the desire of possessing it. And deceiving Yudhishthira by<br>means of the dice played through the hands of the son of Suvala,<br>Duryodhana sent the Pandavas into the woods for twelve years and one<br>additional year to be passed in concealment, thus making the period full<br>thirteen.<br><br>"And the fourteenth year, O monarch, when the Pandavas returned and<br>claimed their property, they did not obtain it. And thereupon war was<br>declared, and the Pandavas, after exterminating the whole race of<br>Kshatriyas and slaying king Duryodhana, obtained back their devastated<br>kingdom.<br><br>"This is the history of the Pandavas who never acted under the influence<br>of evil passions; and this the account, O first of victorious monarchs of<br>the disunion that ended in the loss of their kingdom by the Kurus and the<br>victory of the Pandavas.'"
