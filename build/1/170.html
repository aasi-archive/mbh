                            (Chaitraratha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing these words of the Brahmana, the sons of<br>Kunti seemed to be, as it were, pierced with darts. Indeed, all those<br>mighty heroes lost their peace of mind. Then the truthful Kunti,<br>beholding all her sons listless and inattentive, addressed Yudhishthira<br>and said, 'We have now lived many nights in the abode of this Brahmana.<br>We have passed our time pleasantly in this town, living on the alms<br>obtained from many honest and illustrious persons. O oppressor of foes,<br>as we have now seen often and often all the agreeable woods and gardens<br>that are in this part of the country, seeing them again would no longer<br>give any pleasure. O heroic scion of Kuru's race, alms also are not now<br>obtainable here as easily as before. If thou wishest it would be well for<br>us now to go to Panchala; we have not seen that country, it will, no<br>doubt, O hero, prove delightful to us. O crusher of foes, it hath been<br>heard by us that alms are obtainable in the country of the Panchala, and<br>that Yajnasena, the king thereof, is devoted to Brahmanas. I am of<br>opinion that it is not good to live long in one place. Therefore, O son,<br>if thou likest, it is good for us to go there.'<br><br>"Hearing these words, Yudhishthira said, 'It is our duty to obey thy<br>command, which, besides, must be for our good, I do not, however, know<br>whether my younger brothers are willing to go.'"
