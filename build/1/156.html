                            (Hidimva-vadha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Roused from sleep, those tigers among men, with<br>their mother, beholding the extraordinary beauty of Hidimva, were filled<br>with wonder. And Kunti, gazing at her with wonder at her beauty,<br>addressed her sweetly and gave her every assurance. She asked, 'O thou of<br>the splendour of a daughter of the celestials, whose art thou and who art<br>thou? O thou of the fairest complexion, on what business hast thou come<br>hither and whence hast thou come? If thou art the deity of these woods or<br>an Apsara, tell me all regarding thyself and also why thou stayest here?'<br>Thereupon Hidimva replied, 'This extensive forest that thou seest, of the<br>hue of blue cloud, is the abode of a Rakshasa of the name of Hidimva. O<br>handsome lady, know me as the sister of that chief of the Rakshasa.<br>Revered dame, I had been sent by that brother of mine to kill thee with<br>all thy children. But on arriving here at the command of that cruel<br>brother of mine, I beheld thy mighty son. Then, O blessed lady, I was<br>brought under the control of thy son by the deity of love who pervadeth<br>the nature of every being, and I then (mentally) chose that mighty son of<br>thine as my husband. I tried my best to convey you hence, but I could not<br>(because of thy son's opposition). Then the cannibal, seeing my delay,<br>came hither to kill all these thy children. But he hath been dragged<br>hence with force by that mighty and intelligent son of thine&#8212;my husband.<br>Behold now that couple&#8212;man and Rakshasa&#8212;both endued with great strength<br>and prowess, engaged in combat, grinding each other and filling the whole<br>region with their shouts.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing those words of hers, Yudhishthira<br>suddenly rose up and Arjuna also and Nakula and Sahadeva of great energy<br>and they beheld Bhima and the Rakshasa already engaged in fight, eager to<br>overcome each other and dragging each other with great force, like two<br>lions endued with great might. The dust raised by their feet in<br>consequence of that encounter looked like the smoke of a<br>forest-conflagration. Covered with that dust their huge bodies resembled<br>two tall cliffs enveloped in mist. Then Arjuna, beholding Bhima rather<br>oppressed in the fight by the Rakshasa, slowly, said with smiles on his<br>lips, 'Fear not, O Bhima of mighty arms! We (had been asleep and<br>therefore) knew not that thou wast engaged with a terrible Rakshasa and<br>tired in fight. Here do I stand to help thee, let me slay the Rakshasa,<br>and let Nakula and Sahadeva protect our mother.' Hearing him, Bhima said,<br>'Look on this encounter, O brother, like a stranger. Fear not for the<br>result. Having come within the reach of my arms, he shall not escape with<br>life.' Then Arjuna said, 'What need, O Bhima, for keeping the Rakshasa<br>alive so long? O oppressor of enemies, we are to go hence, and cannot<br>stay here longer. The east is reddening, the morning twilight is about to<br>set in. The Rakshasa became stronger by break of day, therefore, hasten,<br>O Bhima! Play not (with thy victim), but slay the terrible Rakshasa soon.<br>During the two twilights Rakshasas always put forth their powers of<br>deception. Use all the strength of thy arms.<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'At this speech of Arjuna, Bhima blazing up with<br>anger, summoned the might that Vayu (his father) puts forth at the time<br>of the universal dissolution. And filled with rage, he quickly raised<br>high in the air the Rakshasa's body, blue as the clouds of heaven, and<br>whirled it a hundred times. Then addressing the cannibal, Bhima said, 'O<br>Rakshasa, thy intelligence was given thee in vain, and in vain hast thou<br>grown and thriven on unsanctified flesh. Thou deservest, therefore, an<br>unholy death and I shall reduce thee today to nothing. I shall make this<br>forest blessed today, like one without prickly plants. And, O Rakshasa,<br>thou shalt no longer slay human beings for thy food.' Arjuna at this<br>juncture, said, 'O Bhima, if thou thinkest it a hard task for thee to<br>overcome this Rakshasa in combat, let me render thee help, else, slay him<br>thyself without loss of time. Or, O Vrikodara, let me alone slay the<br>Rakshasa. Thou art tired, and hast almost finished the affair. Well dost<br>thou deserve rest.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of Arjuna, Bhima was fired<br>with rage and dashing the Rakshasa on the ground with all his might slew<br>him as if he were an animal. The Rakshasa, while dying, sent forth a<br>terrible yell that filled the whole forest, and was deep as the sound of<br>a wet drum. Then the mighty Bhima, holding the body with his hands, bent<br>it double, and breaking it in the middle, greatly gratified his brothers.<br>Beholding Hidimva slain, they became exceedingly glad and lost no time in<br>offering their congratulations to Bhima, that chastiser of all foes. Then<br>Arjuna worshipping the illustrious Bhima of terrible prowess, addressed<br>him again and said, 'Revered senior, I think there is a town not far off<br>from this forest. Blest be thou, let us go hence soon, so that Duryodhana<br>may not trace us.'<br><br>"Then all those mighty car-warriors, those tigers among men, saying, 'So<br>be it,' proceeded along with their mother, followed by Hidimva, the<br>Rakshasa woman.'"
