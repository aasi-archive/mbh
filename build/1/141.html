                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'After the expiration, O king, of a year from<br>this, Dhritarashtra, moved by kindness for the people, installed<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu, as the heir-apparent of the kingdom on<br>account of his firmness, fortitude, patience, benevolence, frankness and<br>unswerving honesty (of heart). And within a short time Yudhishthira, the<br>son of Kunti, by his good behaviour, manners and close application to<br>business, overshadowed the deeds of his father. And the second Pandava,<br>Vrikodara, began to receive continued lessons from Sankarshana (Valarama)<br>in encounters with the sword and the mace and on the chariot. And after<br>Bhima's education was finished, he became in strength like unto<br>Dyumatsena himself and continuing to live in harmony with his brothers,<br>he began to exert his prowess. And Arjuna became celebrated for the<br>firmness of his grasp (of weapons), for his lightness of motion,<br>precision of aim, and his proficiency in the use of the Kshura, Naracha,<br>Vala and Vipatha weapons, indeed, of all weapons, whether straight or<br>crooked or heavy. And Drona certified that there was none in the world<br>who was equal to Arjuna in lightness of hand and general proficiency.<br><br>"One day, Drona, addressing Arjuna before the assembled Kaurava princes,<br>said, 'There was a disciple of Agastya in the science of arms called<br>Agnivesa. He was my preceptor and I, his disciple. By ascetic merit I<br>obtained from him a weapon called Brahmasira which could never be futile<br>and which was like unto thunder itself, capable of consuming the whole<br>earth. That weapon, O Bharata, from what I have done, may now pass from<br>disciple to disciple. While imparting it to me, my preceptor said, 'O son<br>of Bharadwaja, never shouldst thou hurl this weapon at any human being,<br>especially at one who is of poor energy. Thou hast, O hero, obtained that<br>celestial weapon. None else deserveth it. But obey the command of the<br>Rishi (Agnivesa). And, look here, Arjuna, give me now the preceptorial<br>fee in the presence of these thy cousins and relatives.' When Arjuna, on<br>hearing this, pledged his word that he would give what the preceptor<br>demanded, the latter said, 'O sinless one, thou must fight with me when I<br>fight with thee.' And that bull among the Kuru princes thereupon pledged<br>his word unto Drona and touching his feet, went away northward. Then<br>there arose a loud shout covering the whole earth bounded by her belt of<br>seas to the effect that there was no bowman in the whole world like unto<br>Arjuna. And, indeed, Dhananjaya, in encounters with the mace and the<br>sword and on the chariot as also with the bow, acquired wonderful<br>proficiency. Sahadeva obtained the whole science of morality and duties<br>from (Vrihaspati) the spiritual chief of celestials, and continued to<br>live under the control of his brothers. And Nakula, the favourite of his<br>brothers taught by Drona, became known as a skilful warrior and a great<br>car-warrior (Ati-ratha). Indeed, Arjuna and the other Pandava princes<br>became so powerful that they slew in battle the great Sauvira who had<br>performed a sacrifice extending over three years, undaunted by the raids<br>of the Gandharvas. And the king of the Yavanas himself whom the powerful<br>Pandu even had failed to bring under subjection was brought by Arjuna<br>under control. Then again Vipula, the king of the Sauviras, endued with<br>great prowess, who had always shown a disregard for the Kurus, was made<br>by the intelligent Arjuna to feel the edge of his power. And Arjuna also<br>repressed by means of his arrows (the pride of) king Sumitra of Sauvira,<br>also known by the name of Dattamitra who had resolutely sought an<br>encounter with him. The third of the Pandava princes, assisted by Bhima,<br>on only a single car subjugated all the kings of the East backed by ten<br>thousand cars. In the same way, having conquered on a single car the<br>whole of the south, Dhananjaya sent unto the kingdom of the Kurus a large<br>booty.<br><br>"Thus did those foremost of men, the illustrious Pandavas, conquering the<br>territories of other kings, extend the limits of their own kingdom. But<br>beholding the great prowess and strength of those mighty bowmen, king<br>Dhritarashtra's sentiments towards the Pandavas became suddenly poisoned,<br>and from that day the monarch became so anxious that he could hardly<br>sleep.'"
