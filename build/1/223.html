                            (Haranaharana Parva)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'When the heroes of the Vrishni race began to speak<br>repeatedly in this strain, Vasudeva uttered these words pregnant with<br>deep import and consistent with true morality. Gudakesa (the conqueror of<br>sleep or he of the curly hair), by what he hath done, hath not insulted<br>our family. He hath without doubt, rather enhanced our respect. Partha<br>knoweth that we of the Satwata race are never mercenary. The son of Pandu<br>also regardeth a self-choice as doubtful in its results. Who also would<br>approve of accepting a bride in gift as if she were an animal? What man<br>again is there on earth that would sell his offspring? I think Arjuna,<br>seeing these faults in all the other methods took the maiden away by<br>force, according to the ordinance. This alliance is very proper. Subhadra<br>is a renowned girl. Partha too possesseth renown. Perhaps, thinking of<br>all this, Arjuna hath taken her away by force. Who is there that would<br>not desire to have Arjuna for a friend, who is born in the race of<br>Bharata and the renowned Santanu, and the son also of the daughter of<br>Kuntibhoja? I do not see, in all the worlds with Indra and the Rudras,<br>the person that can by force vanquish Partha in battle, except the<br>three-eyed god Mahadeva. His car is well-known. Yoked thereunto are those<br>steeds of mine. Partha as a warrior is well-known; and his lightness of<br>hand is well-known. Who shall be equal to him? Even this is my opinion:<br>go ye cheerfully after Dhananjaya and by conciliation stop him and bring<br>him back. If Partha goes to his city after having vanquished us by force,<br>our fame will be gone. There is no disgrace, however, in conciliation.'<br>Hearing, O monarch, those words of Vasudeva, they did as he directed.<br>Stopped by them, Arjuna returned to Dwaraka and was united in marriage<br>with Subhadra. Worshipped by the sons of Vrishni's race, Arjuna, sporting<br>there as he pleased, passed a whole year in Dwaraka. The last year of his<br>exile the exalted one passed at the sacred region of Pushkara. After the<br>twelve years were complete he came back to Khandavaprastha. He approached<br>the king first and then worshipped the Brahmanas with respectful<br>attention. At last the hero went unto Draupadi. Draupadi, from jealousy,<br>spoke unto him, saying, 'Why tarriest thou here, O son of Kunti? Go where<br>the daughter of the Satwata race is! A second tie always relaxeth the<br>first one upon a faggot!' And Krishna lamented much in this strain. But<br>Dhananjaya pacified her repeatedly and asked for her forgiveness. And<br>returning soon unto where Subhadra, attired in red silk, was staying,<br>Arjuna, sent her into the inner apartments dressed not as a queen but in<br>the simple garb of a cowherd woman. But arrived at the palace, the<br>renowned Subhadra looked handsomer in that dress. The celebrated Bhadra<br>of large and slightly red eyes first worshipped Pritha. Kunti from excess<br>of affection smelt the head of that girl of perfectly faultless features,<br>and pronounced infinite blessing upon her. Then that girl of face like<br>the full moon hastily went unto Draupadi and worshipped her, saying, 'I<br>am thy maid!' Krishna rose hastily and embraced the sister of Madhava<br>from affection, and said, 'Let thy husband be without a foe!' Bhadra<br>then, with a delighted heart, said unto Draupadi, 'So be it!' From that<br>time, O Janamejaya, those great warriors, the Pandavas, began to live<br>happily, and Kunti also became very happy.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'When that scorcher of foes, viz., Kesava of<br>pure soul and eyes, like lotus-petals, heard that the foremost of the<br>Pandavas, viz., Arjuna, had reached his own excellent city of<br>Indraprastha, he came thither accompanied by Rama and the other heroes<br>and great warriors of the Vrishni and the Andhaka tribes, and by his<br>brothers and sons and many other brave warriors. And Saurin came<br>accompanied by a large army that protected him. And there came with<br>Saurin, that oppressor of foes, viz., the exceedingly liberal Akrura of<br>great intelligence and renown, the generalissimo of the brave Vrishni<br>host. And there also came Anadhrishti of great prowess, and Uddhava of<br>great renown, of great intelligence, of great soul, and a disciple of<br>Vrihaspati himself. And there also came Satyaka and Salyaka and<br>Kritavarman and Satwata; and Pradyumna and Samva and Nisatha and Sanku;<br>and Charudeshna, and Jhilli of great prowess, and Viprithu also and<br>Sarana of mighty arms and Gada, the foremost of learned men. These and<br>many other Vrishnis and Bhojas, and Andhakas came to Indraprastha,<br>bringing with them many nuptial presents. King Yudhishthira, hearing that<br>Madhava had arrived, sent the twins out to receive him. Received by them,<br>the Vrishni host of great prosperity entered Khandavaprastha well-adorned<br>with flags and ensigns. The streets were well-swept and watered and<br>decked with floral wreaths and bunches. These were, again, sprinkled over<br>with sandalwood water that was fragrant and cooling. Every part of the<br>town was filled with the sweet scent of burning aloes. And the city was<br>full of joyous and healthy people and adorned with merchants and traders.<br>That best of men, viz., Kesava of mighty arms, accompanied by Rama and<br>many of the Vrishnis, Andhakas and Bhojas, having entered the town, was<br>worshipped by the citizens and Brahmanas by thousands. At last Kesava<br>entered the palace of the king which was like unto the mansion of Indra<br>himself. Beholding Rama, Yudhishthira received him with due ceremonies.<br>The king smelt the head of Kesava and embraced him. Govinda, gratified<br>with the reception, humbly worshipped Yudhishthira. He also paid homage<br>unto Bhima, that tiger among men. Yudhishthira the son of Kunti then<br>received the other principal men of the Vrishni and the Andhaka tribes<br>with due ceremonies. Yudhishthira reverentially worshipped some as his<br>superiors, and welcomed others as equals. And some he received with<br>affection and by some he was worshipped with reverence. Then Hrishikesa<br>of great renown gave unto the party of the bridegroom much wealth. And<br>unto Subhadra he gave the nuptial presents that had been given to her by<br>her relatives. Krishna gave unto the Pandavas a thousand cars of gold<br>furnished with rows of bells, and unto each of which were put four steeds<br>driven by well-trained charioteers. He also gave unto them ten thousand<br>cows belonging to the country of Mathura, and yielding much milk and all<br>of excellent colour. Well-pleased, Janardana also gave them a thousand<br>mares with gold harnesses and of colour white as the beams of the moon.<br>He also gave them a thousand mules, all well-trained and possessing the<br>speed of the wind, of white colour with black manes. And he of eyes like<br>lotus-petals also gave unto them a thousand damsels well-skilled in<br>assisting at bathing and at drinking, young in years and virgins all<br>before their first-season, well-attired and of excellent complexion, each<br>wearing a hundred pieces of gold around her neck, of skins perfectly<br>polished, decked with every ornament, and well-skilled in every kind of<br>personal service. Janardana also gave unto them hundreds of thousands of<br>draft horses from the country of the Valhikas as Subhadra's excellent<br>dower. That foremost one of Dasarha's race also gave unto Subhadra as her<br>peculium ten carrier-loads of first class gold possessing the splendour<br>of fire, some purified and some in a state of ore. And Rama having the<br>plough for his weapon and always loving bravery gave unto Arjuna, as a<br>nuptial present, a thousand elephants with secretions flowing in three<br>streams from the three parts of their bodies (the temple, the ears, and<br>the anus) each large as a mountain summit, irresistible in battle, decked<br>with coverlets and bells, well-adorned with other golden ornaments, and<br>equipped with excellent thrones on their backs. And that large wave of<br>wealth and gems that the Yadavas presented, together with the cloths and<br>blankets that represented its foam, and the elephants its alligators and<br>sharks, and the flags its floating weeds swelling into large proportions,<br>mingled with the Pandu ocean and filled it to the brim, to the great<br>sorrow of all foes. Yudhishthira accepted all those presents and<br>worshipped all those great warriors of the Vrishni and the Andhaka races.<br>Those illustrious heroes of the Kuru, the Vrishni, and the Andhaka races<br>passed their days in pleasure and merriment there like virtuous men<br>(after death) in the celestial regions. The Kurus and the Vrishnis with<br>joyous hearts amused themselves there, setting up at times loud shouts<br>mingled with clappings of the hand. Spending many days in sports and<br>merriment there, and worshipped by the Kurus all the while, the Vrishni<br>heroes endued with great energy then returned to the city of Dwaravati.<br>And the great warriors of the Vrishni and the Andhaka races set out with<br>Rama in the van, carrying with them those gems of the purest rays that<br>had been given them by those foremost ones of Kuru's race. And, O<br>Bharata, the high-souled Vasudeva remained there with Arjuna in the<br>delightful city of Indraprastha. And the illustrious one wandered over<br>the banks of the Yamuna in search of deer. And he sported with Arjuna<br>piercing with his shafts deer and wild boars. Then Subhadra, the<br>favourite sister of Kesava, gave birth to an illustrious son, like<br>Puloma's daughter, (the queen of heaven) bringing forth Jayanta. And the<br>son that Subhadra brought forth was of long arms, broad chest, and eyes<br>as large as those of a bull. That hero and oppressor of foes came to be<br>called Abhimanyu. And the son of Arjuna, that grinder of foes and bull<br>among men, was called Abhimanyu because he was fearless and wrathful. And<br>that great warrior was begotten upon the daughter of the Satwata race by<br>Dhananjaya, like fire produced in a sacrifice from within the sami wood<br>by the process of rubbing. Upon the birth of this child, Yudhishthira,<br>the powerful son of Kunti, gave away unto Brahmanas ten thousand cows and<br>coins of gold. The child from his earliest years became the favourite of<br>Vasudeva and of his father and uncles, like the moon of all the people of<br>the world. Upon his birth, Krishna performed the usual rites of infancy.<br>The child began to grow up like the Moon of the bright fortnight. That<br>grinder of foes soon became conversant with the Vedas and acquired from<br>his father the science of weapon both celestial and human, consisting of<br>four branches and ten divisions.<br><br>"Endued with great strength, the child also acquired the knowledge of<br>counteracting the weapons hurled at him by others, and great lightness of<br>hand and fleetness of motion forward and backward and transverse and<br>wheeling. Abhimanyu became like unto his father in knowledge of the<br>scriptures and rites of religion. And Dhananjaya, beholding his son,<br>became filled with joy. Like Maghavat beholding Arjuna, the latter beheld<br>his son Abhimanyu and became exceedingly happy. Abhimanyu possessed the<br>power of slaying every foe and bore on his person every auspicious mark.<br>He was invisible in battle and broad-shouldered as the bull. Possessing a<br>broad face as (the hood of) the snake, he was proud like the lion.<br>Wielding a large bow, his prowess was like that of an elephant in rut.<br>Possessed of a face handsome as the full-moon, and of a voice deep as the<br>sound of the drum or the clouds, he was equal unto Krishna in bravery and<br>energy, in beauty and in features. The auspicious Panchali also, from her<br>five husbands, obtained five sons all of whom were heroes of the foremost<br>rank and immovable in battle like the hills. Prativindhya by<br>Yudhishthira, Sutasoma by Vrikodara, Srutakarman by Arjuna, Satanika by<br>Nakula, and Srutasena by Sahadeva,&#8212;these were the five heroes and great<br>warriors that Panchali brought forth, like Aditi bringing forth the<br>Adityas. And the Brahmanas, from their foreknowledge, said unto<br>Yudhishthira that as the son of his would be capable of bearing like the<br>Vindhya mountains the weapons of the foe, he should be called<br>Prativindhya. And because the child that Draupadi bore to Bhimasena was<br>born after Bhima had performed a thousand Soma sacrifices, he came to be<br>called Sutasoma. And because Arjuna's son was born upon his return from<br>exile during which he had achieved many celebrated feats, that child came<br>to be called Srutakarman. While Nakula named his son Satanika after a<br>royal sage of that name, in the illustrious race of Kuru. Again the son<br>that Draupadi bore to Sahadeva was born under the constellation called<br>Vahni-daivata (Krittika), therefore was he called after the generalissimo<br>of the celestial host, Srutasena (Kartikeya). The sons of Draupadi were<br>born, each at the interval of one year, and all of them became renowned<br>and much attached to one another. And, O monarch, all their rites of<br>infancy and childhood, such as Chudakarana and Upanayana (first shave of<br>the head and investiture with the sacred threads) were performed by<br>Dhaumya according to the ordinance. All of them, of excellent behaviour<br>and vows, after having studied the Vedas, acquired from Arjuna a<br>knowledge of all the weapons, celestial and human. And, O tiger among<br>kings, the Pandavas, having obtained sons all of whom were equal unto the<br>children of the celestials and endued with broad chests, and all of whom<br>became great warriors, were filled with joy.'"
