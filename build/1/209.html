                            (Viduragamana Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing these words of Vidura, Drupada said, 'It is<br>even so as thou, O Vidura of great wisdom, hast said. Venerable one, I<br>too have been exceedingly happy in consequence of this alliance. It is<br>highly proper that these illustrious princes should return to their<br>ancestral kingdom. But it is not proper for me to say this myself. If the<br>brave son of Kunti viz., Yudhishthira, if Bhima and Arjuna, if these<br>bulls among men, viz., the twins, themselves desire to go and if Rama<br>(Valadeva) and Krishna, both acquainted with every rule of morality, be<br>of the same mind, then let the Pandavas go thither. For these tigers<br>among men (Rama and Krishna) are ever engaged in doing what is agreeable<br>and beneficial to the sons of Pandu.'<br><br>"Hearing this, Yudhishthira said, 'We are now, O monarch, with all our<br>younger brothers, dependent on thee. We shall cheerfully do what thou art<br>pleased to command.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Vasudeva said, 'I am of opinion that the<br>Pandavas should go. But we should all abide by the opinion of king<br>Drupada who is conversant with every rule of morality.'<br><br>"Drupada then spoke, 'I certainly agree with what this foremost of men,<br>thinketh, having regard to the circumstances. For the illustrious sons of<br>Pandu now are to me as they are, without doubt, to Vasudeva. Kunti's son<br>Yudhishthira himself doth not seek the welfare of the Pandavas so<br>earnestly as, Kesava, that tiger among men.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Commanded by the illustrious Drupada, the<br>Pandavas, then, O king, and Krishna and Vidura, taking with them Krishna,<br>the daughter of Drupada, and the renowned Kunti, journeyed towards the<br>city called after the elephant, stopping at various places along the way<br>for purposes of pleasure and enjoyment. King Dhritarashtra, hearing that<br>those heroes had neared the capital sent out the Kauravas to receive<br>them. They who were thus sent out were, O Bharata, Vikarna of the great<br>bow, and Chitrasena, and Drona that foremost of warriors, and Kripa of<br>Gautama's line. Surrounded by these, those mighty heroes, their splendour<br>enhanced by that throng slowly entered the city of Hastinapura. The whole<br>city became radiant, as it were, with the gay throng of sight-seers<br>animated by curiosity. Those tigers among men gladdened the hearts of all<br>who beheld them. And the Pandavas, dear unto the hearts of the people,<br>heard, as they proceeded, various exclamations with the citizens, ever<br>desirous of obeying the wishes of those princes, loudly uttered. Some<br>exclaimed, 'Here returns that tiger among men, conversant with all the<br>rules of morality and who always protects us as if we were his nearest<br>relatives.' And elsewhere they said, 'It seems that king Pandu&#8212;the<br>beloved of his people&#8212;returneth today from the forest, doubtless to do<br>what is agreeable to us.' And there were some that said, 'What good is<br>not done to us today when the heroic sons of Kunti come back to our town?<br>If we have ever given away in charity, if we have ever poured libations<br>of clarified butter on the fire, if we have any ascetic merit, let the<br>Pandavas, by virtue of all those acts stay in our town for a hundred<br>years.'<br><br>"At last the Pandavas, on arriving at the place, worshipped the feet of<br>Dhritarashtra, as also those of the illustrious Bhishma. They also<br>worshipped the feet of everybody else that deserved that honour. And they<br>enquired after the welfare of every citizen (there present). At last, at<br>the command of Dhritarashtra they entered the chambers that had been<br>assigned to them.<br><br>"After they had rested there for some time, they were summoned (to the<br>court) by king Dhritarashtra and Bhishma, the son of Santanu. When they<br>came, king Dhritarashtra addressing Yudhishthira, said, 'Listen, O son of<br>Kunti, with thy brothers, to what I say. Repair ye to Khandavaprastha so<br>that no difference may arise again (between you and your cousins). If you<br>take up your quarters there no one will be able to do you any injury.<br>Protected by Partha (Arjuna), like the celestials by the thunderbolt,<br>reside ye at Khandavaprastha, taking half of the kingdom.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Agreeing to what Dhritarashtra said, those<br>bulls among men worshipping the king set out from Hastinapura. And<br>content with half the kingdom, they removed to Khandavaprastha, which was<br>in unreclaimed desert. Then those heroes of unfading splendour, viz., the<br>Pandavas, with Krishna at their head, arriving there, beautified the<br>place and made it a second heaven. And those mighty car-warriors,<br>selecting with Dwaipayana's assistance a sacred and auspicious region,<br>performed certain propitiatory ceremonies and measured out a piece of<br>land for their city. Then surrounded by a trench wide as the sea and by<br>walls reaching high up to the heavens and white as the fleecy clouds or<br>the rays of the moon, that foremost of cities looked resplendent like<br>Bhogavati (the capital of the nether kingdom) decked with the Nagas. And<br>it stood adorned with palatial mansions and numerous gates, each<br>furnished with a couple of panels resembling the out-stretched wings of<br>Garuda. And it was protected with gateways looking like the clouds and<br>high as the Mandara mountains. And well-furnished with numerous weapons<br>of attack the missiles of the foes could not make slightest impression on<br>them. And they were almost covered with darts and other missiles like<br>double-tongued snakes. The turrets along the walls were filled with armed<br>men in course of training; and the walls were lined with numerous<br>warriors along their whole length. And there were thousands of sharp<br>hooks and Sataghnis (machines slaying a century of warriors) and numerous<br>other machines on the battlements. There were also large iron wheels<br>planted on them. And with all these was that foremost of cities adorned.<br>The streets were all wide and laid out excellently; and there was no fear<br>in them of accident. And decked with innumerable mansions, the city<br>became like unto Amaravati and came to be called Indraprastha (like unto<br>Indra's city). In a delightful and auspicious part of the city rose the<br>palace of the Pandavas filled with every kind of wealth and like unto the<br>mansion of the celestial treasurer (Kuvera) himself. And it looked like a<br>mass of clouds charged with lightning.<br><br>"When the city was built, there came, O king, numerous Brahmanas<br>well-acquainted with all the Vedas and conversant with every language,<br>wishing to dwell there. And there came also unto that town numerous<br>merchants from every direction, in the hope of earning wealth. There also<br>came numerous persons well-skilled in all the arts, wishing to take up<br>their abode there. And around the city were laid out many delightful<br>gardens adorned with numerous trees bearing both fruits and flowers.<br>There were Amras (mango trees) and Amaratakas, and Kadamvas and Asokas,<br>and Champakas; and Punnagas and Nagas and Lakuchas and Panasas; and Salas<br>and Talas (palm trees) and Tamalas and Vakulas, and Ketakas with their<br>fragrant loads; beautiful and blossoming and grand Amalakas with branches<br>bent down with the weight of fruits and Lodhras and blossoming Ankolas;<br>and Jamvus (blackberry trees) and Patalas and Kunjakas and Atimuktas; and<br>Karaviras and Parijatas and numerous other kinds of trees always adorned<br>with flowers and fruits and alive with feathery creatures of various<br>species. And those verdant groves always resounded with the notes of<br>maddened peacocks and Kokilas (blackbirds). And there were various<br>pleasure-houses, bright as mirrors, and numerous bowers of creepers, and<br>charming and artificial hillocks, and many lakes full to the brim of<br>crystal water, and delightful tanks fragrant with lotuses and lilies and<br>adorned with swans and ducks and chakravakas (brahminy ducks). And there<br>were many delicious pools overgrown with fine aquatic plants. And there<br>were also diverse ponds of great beauty and large dimension. And, O king,<br>the joy of the Pandavas increased from day to day, in consequence of<br>their residence in that large kingdom that was peopled with pious men.<br><br>"Thus in consequence of the virtuous behaviour of Bhishma and king<br>Dhritarashtra towards them, the Pandavas took up their abode in<br>Khandavaprastha. Adorned with those five mighty warriors, each equal unto<br>Indra himself, that foremost of cities looked like Bhogavati (the capital<br>of the nether kingdom) adorned with the Nagas. And, O monarch, having<br>settled the Pandavas there, the heroic Krishna, obtaining their leave,<br>came back with Rama to Dwaravati.'"
