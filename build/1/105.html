                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Bhishma, continued, 'Listen, O mother, to me as I indicate the means by<br>which the Bharata line may be perpetuated. Let an accomplished Brahmana<br>be invited by an offer of wealth, and let him raise offspring upon the<br>wives of Vichitravirya.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Satyavati, then, smiling softly and in voice<br>broken in bashfulness, addressed Bhishma saying, 'O Bharata of mighty<br>arms, what thou sayest is true. From my confidence in thee I shall now<br>indicate the means of perpetuating our line. Thou shall not be able to<br>reject it, being conversant, as thou art, with the practices permitted in<br>seasons of distress. In our race, thou art Virtue, and thou art Truth,<br>and thou art, too, our sole refuge. Therefore hearing what I say truly,<br>do what may be proper.<br><br>"My father was a virtuous man. For virtue's sake he had kept a (ferry)<br>boat. One day, in the prime of my youth, I went to ply that boat. It so<br>happened that the great and wise Rishi Parasara, that foremost of all<br>virtuous men, came, and betook himself to my boat for crossing the<br>Yamuna. As I was rowing him across the river, the Rishi became excited<br>with desire and began to address me in soft words. The fear of my father<br>was uppermost in my mind. But the terror of the Rishi's curse at last<br>prevailed. And having obtained from him a precious boon, I could not<br>refuse his solicitations. The Rishi by his energy brought me under his<br>complete control, and gratified his desire then and there, having first<br>enveloped the region in a thick fog. Before this there was a revolting<br>fishy odour in my body; but the Rishi dispelled it and gave me my present<br>fragrance. The Rishi also told me that by bringing forth his child in an<br>island of the river, I would still continue (to be) a virgin. And the<br>child of Parasara so born of me in my maidenhood hath become a great<br>Rishi endued with large ascetic powers and known by the name of<br>Dwaipayana (the island-born). That illustrious Rishi having by his<br>ascetic power divided the Vedas into four parts hath come to be called on<br>earth by the name of Vyasa (the divider or arranger), and for his dark<br>colour, Krishna (the dark). Truthful in speech, free from passion, a<br>mighty ascetic who hath burnt all his sins, he went away with his father<br>immediately after his birth. Appointed by me and thee also, that Rishi of<br>incomparable splendour will certainly beget good children upon the wives<br>of thy brother. He told me when he went away, 'Mother, think of me when<br>thou art in difficulty.' I will now call him up, if thou, O Bhishma of<br>mighty arms so desirest. If thou art willing, O Bhishma, I am sure that<br>great ascetic will beget children upon Vichitravirya's field.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Mention being made of the great Rishi, Bhishma<br>with joined palms said, 'That man is truly intelligent who fixes his eyes<br>judiciously on virtue, profit, and pleasure, and who after reflecting<br>with patience, acteth in such a way that virtue may lead to future<br>virtue, profit to future profit and pleasure to future pleasure.<br>Therefore, that which hath been said by thee and which, besides being<br>beneficial to us, is consistent with virtue, is certainly the best advice<br>and hath my full approval.' And when Bhishma had said this, O thou of<br>Kuru's race, Kali (Satyavati) thought of the Muni Dwaipayana and<br>Dwaipayana who was then engaged in interpreting the Vedas, learning that<br>he was being called up by his mother, came instantly unto her without<br>anybody's knowing it. Satayavati then duly greeted her son and embraced<br>him with arms, bathing him in her tears, for the daughter of the<br>fisherman wept bitterly at the sight of her son after so long a time. And<br>her first son, the great Vyasa, beholding her weeping, washed her with<br>cool water, and bowing unto her, said, 'I have come, O mother, to fulfil<br>thy wishes. Therefore, O virtuous one, command me without delay. I shall<br>accomplish thy desire.' The family priest of the Bharatas then worshipped<br>the great Rishi duly, and the latter accepted the offerings of worship,<br>uttering the usual mantras. And gratified with the worship he received,<br>he took his seat. Satyavati, beholding him seated at his ease, after the<br>usual inquiries, addressed him and said, 'O learned one, sons derive<br>their birth both from the father and the mother. They are, therefore, the<br>common property of both parents. There cannot be the least doubt about it<br>that the mother, hath as much power over them as the father. As thou art,<br>indeed, my eldest son according to the ordinance, O Brahmarshi, so is<br>Vichitravirya my youngest son. And as Bhishma is Vichitravirya's brother<br>on the father's side, so art thou his brother on the same mother's side.<br>I do not know what you may think, but this is what, O son, I think. This<br>Bhishma, the son of Santanu, devoted to truth, doth not, for the sake, of<br>truth, entertain the desire of either begetting children or ruling the<br>kingdom. Therefore, from affection for thy brother Vichitravirya, for the<br>perpetuation of our dynasty, for the sake of this Bhishma's request and<br>my command, for kindness to all creatures, for the protection of the<br>people and from the liberality of thy heart, O sinless one, it behoveth<br>thee to do what I say. Thy younger brother hath left two widows like unto<br>the daughters of the celestials themselves, endued with youth and great<br>beauty. For the sake of virtue and religion, they have become desirous of<br>offspring. Thou art the fittest person to be appointed. Therefore beget<br>upon them children worthy of our race and for the continuance of our<br>line.'<br><br>"Vyasa, hearing this, said, 'O Satyavati, thou knowest what virtue is<br>both in respect of this life and the other. O thou of great wisdom, thy<br>affections also are set on virtue. Therefore, at thy command, making<br>virtue my motive, I shall do what thou desirest. Indeed, this practice<br>that is conformable to the true and eternal religion is known to me, I<br>shall give unto my brother children that shall be like unto Mitra and<br>Varuna. Let the ladies then duly observe for one full year the vow I<br>indicate. They shall then be purified. No women shall ever approach me<br>without having observed a rigid vow.'<br><br>"Satyavati then said, 'O sinless one, it must be as thou sayest. Take<br>such steps that the ladies may conceive immediately. In a kingdom where<br>there is no king, the people perish from want of protection; sacrifices<br>and other holy acts are suspended; the clouds send no showers; and the<br>gods disappear. How can a kingdom be protected that hath no king?<br>Therefore, see thou that the ladies conceive. Bhishma will watch over the<br>children as long as they are in their mother's wombs.<br><br>"Vyasa replied, 'If I am to give unto my brother children so<br>unseasonably, then let the ladies bear my ugliness. That in itself shall,<br>in their case, be the austerest of penances. If the princess of Kosala<br>can bear my strong odour, my ugly and grim visage, my attire and body,<br>she shall then conceive an excellent child.'"<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having spoken thus unto Satyavati, Vyasa of<br>great energy addressed her and said, 'Let the princess of Kosala clad in<br>clean attire and checked with ornaments wait for me in her bed-chamber.'<br>Saying this, the Rishi disappeared, Satyavati then went to her<br>daughter-in-law and seeing her in private spoke to her these words of<br>beneficial and virtuous import, 'O princess of Kosala, listen to what I<br>say. It is consistent with virtue. The dynasty of the Bharatas hath<br>become extinct from my misfortune. Beholding my affliction and the<br>extinction of his paternal line, the wise Bhishma, impelled also by the<br>desire of perpetuating our race, hath made me a suggestion, which<br>suggestion, however, for its accomplishment is dependent on thee.<br>Accomplish it, O daughter, and restore the lost line of the Bharatas. O<br>thou of fair hips, bring thou forth a child equal in splendour unto the<br>chief of the celestials. He shall bear the onerous burden of this our<br>hereditary kingdom.'<br><br>"Satyavati having succeeded with great difficulty in procuring the assent<br>of her virtuous daughter-in-law to her proposal which was not<br>inconsistent with virtue, then fed Brahmanas and Rishis and numberless<br>guests who arrived on die occasion.'"
