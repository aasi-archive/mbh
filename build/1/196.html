                            (Vaivahika Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The messenger said, 'King Drupada hath, in view<br>of his daughter's nuptials prepared a good feast for the bride-groom's<br>party. Come ye thither after finishing your daily rites. Krishna's<br>wedding will take place there. Delay ye not. These cars adorned with<br>golden lotuses drawn by excellent horses are worthy of kings. Riding on<br>them, come ye into the abode of the king of the Panchalas.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then those bulls among the Kurus, dismissing<br>the priest and causing Kunti and Krishna to ride together on one of those<br>cars, themselves ascended those splendid vehicles and proceeded towards<br>Drupada's place. Meanwhile, O Bharata, hearing from his priest the words<br>that Yudhishthira had said, king Drupada, in order to ascertain the order<br>to which those heroes belonged, kept ready a large collection of articles<br>(required by the ordinance for the wedding of each of the four orders).<br>And he kept ready fruits, sanctified garlands, and coats of mail, and<br>shields, and carpets, and kine, and seeds, and various other articles and<br>implements of agriculture. And the king also collected, O monarch, every<br>article appertaining to other arts, and various implements and apparatus<br>of every kind of sport. And he also collected excellent coats of mail and<br>shining shields, and swords and scimitars, of fine temper, and beautiful<br>chariots and horses, and first-class bows and well-adorned arrows, and<br>various kinds of missiles ornamented with gold. And he also kept ready<br>darts and rockets and battle-axes and various utensils of war. And there<br>were in that collection beds and carpets and various fine things, and<br>cloths of various sorts. When the party went to Drupada's abode, Kunti<br>taking with her the virtuous Krishna entered the inner apartments of the<br>king. The ladies of the king's household with joyous hearts worshipped<br>the queen of the Kurus. Beholding, O monarch, those foremost of men, each<br>possessing the sportive gait of the lion, with deer-skins for their upper<br>garments, eyes like unto those of mighty bulls, broad shoulders, and<br>long-hanging arms like unto the bodies of mighty snakes, the king, and<br>the king's ministers, and the king's son, and the king's friends and<br>attendants, all became exceedingly glad. Those heroes sat on excellent<br>seats, furnished with footstools without any awkwardness and hesitation.<br>And those foremost of men sat with perfect fearlessness on those costly<br>seats one after another according to the order of their ages. After those<br>heroes were seated, well-dressed servants male and female, and skilful<br>cooks brought excellent and costly viands worthy of kings on gold and<br>silver plates. Then those foremost of men dined on those dishes and<br>became well-pleased. And after the dinner was over, those heroes among<br>men, passing over all other articles, began to observe with interest the<br>various utensils of war. Beholding this, Drupada's son and Drupada<br>himself, along with all his chief ministers of state, understanding the<br>sons of Kunti to be all of royal blood became exceedingly glad.'"
