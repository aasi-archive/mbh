                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed, Kunti replied unto her heroic lord,<br>king Pandu, that bull amongst the Kurus, saying, 'O virtuous one, it<br>behoveth thee not to say so unto me. I am, O thou lotus-eyed one, thy<br>wedded wife, devoted to thee. O, Bharata of mighty arms, thyself shalt,<br>in righteousness, beget upon me children endued with great energy. Then I<br>shall ascend to heaven with thee; O prince of Kuru's race, receive me in<br>thy embrace for begetting children. I shall not certainly, even in<br>imagination, accept any other man except thee in my embraces. What other<br>man is there in this world superior to thee? O virtuous one, listen to<br>this Pauranic narrative that hath been, O thou of large eyes, heard by<br>me, and that I shall presently narrate.<br><br>"There was, in ancient times, a king in the race of Puru, known by the<br>name of Vyushitaswa. He was devoted to truth and virtue. Of virtuous soul<br>and mighty arms, on one occasion, while he was performing a sacrifice the<br>gods with Indra and the great Rishis came to him, and Indra was so<br>intoxicated with the Soma juice he drank and the Brahmanas with the large<br>presents they received, that both the gods and the great Rishis began<br>themselves to perform everything appertaining to that sacrifice of the<br>illustrious royal sage. And thereupon Vyushitaswa began to shine above<br>all men like the Sun appearing in double splendour after the season of<br>frost is over. And the powerful Vyushitaswa, who was endued with the<br>strength of ten elephants very soon performed the horse-sacrifice,<br>overthrowing, O best of monarchs, all the kings of the East, the North,<br>the West and the South, and exacted tributes from them all. There is an<br>anecdote, O best of the Kurus, that is sung by all reciters of the<br>Puranas, in connection with that first of all men, the illustrious<br>Vyushitaswa.&#8212;Having conquered the whole Earth up to the coast of the<br>sea, Vyushitaswa protected every class of his subjects as a father does<br>his own begotten sons.&#8212;Performing many great sacrifices he gave away<br>much wealth to the Brahmanas. After collecting unlimited jewels and<br>precious stones he made arrangements for performing still greater ones.<br>And he performed also the Agnishtoma, and other special Vedic sacrifices,<br>extracting great quantities of Soma juice. And, O king, Vyushitaswa had<br>for his dear wife, Bhadra, the daughter of Kakshivat, unrivalled for<br>beauty on earth. And it hath been heard by us that the couple loved each<br>other deeply. King Vyushitaswa was seldom separated from his wife. Sexual<br>excess, however, brought on an attack of phthisis and the king died<br>within a few days, sinking like the Sun in his glory. Then Bhadra, his<br>beautiful queen, was plunged into woe, and as she was sonless, O tiger<br>among men, she wept in great affliction. Listen to me, O king, as I<br>narrate to you all that Bhadra said with bitter tears trickling down her<br>cheeks. 'O virtuous one', she said, 'Women serve no purpose when their<br>husbands are dead. She who liveth after her husband is dead, draggeth on<br>a miserable existence that can hardly be called life. O bull of the<br>Kshatriya order, death is a blessing to women without husbands. I wish to<br>follow the way thou hast gone. Be kind and take me with thee. In thy<br>absence, I am unable to bear life even for a moment. Be kind to me, O<br>king and take me hence pretty soon. O tiger among men, I shall follow<br>thee over the even and uneven ground. Thou hast gone away, O lord, never<br>to return. I shall follow thee, O king, as thy own shadow. O tiger among<br>men, I will obey thee (as thy slave) and will ever do what is agreeable<br>to thee and what is for thy good. O thou of eyes like lotus-petals,<br>without thee, from this day, mental agonies will overwhelm me and eat<br>into my heart. A wretch that I am, some loving couple had doubtless been<br>separated by me in a former life, for which, in this life, I am made to<br>suffer the pangs of separation from thee. O king, that wretched woman who<br>liveth even for a moment separated from her lord, liveth in woe and<br>suffereth the pangs of hell even here. Some loving couple had doubtless<br>been separated by me in a former life, for which sinful act I am<br>suffering this torture arising from my separation from thee. O king, from<br>this day I will lay myself down on a bed of Kusa grass and abstain from<br>every luxury, hoping to behold thee once more. O tiger among men, show<br>thyself to me. O king, O lord, command once more thy wretched and<br>bitterly weeping wife plunged in woe.'<br><br>"Kunti continued, 'It was thus, O Pandu, that the beautiful Bhadra wept<br>over the death of her lord. And the weeping Bhadra clasped in her arms<br>the corpse in anguish of heart. Then she was addressed by an incorporeal<br>voice in these words, "Rise up, O Bhadra, and leave this place. O thou of<br>sweet smiles, I grant thee this boon. I will beget offspring upon thee.<br>Lie thou down with me on thy own bed, after the catamenial bath, on the<br>night of the eighth or the fourteenth day of the moon.' Thus addressed by<br>the incorporeal voice, the chaste Bhadra did, as she was directed, for<br>obtaining offspring. And, O bull of the Bharatas, the corpse of her<br>husband begat upon her seven children viz., three Salwas and four Madras.<br>O bull of the Bharatas, do thou also beget offspring upon me, like the<br>illustrious Vyushitaswa, by the exercise of that ascetic power which thou<br>possessest.'"
