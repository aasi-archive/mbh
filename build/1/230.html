                            (Khandava-daha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then the inhabitants of the forest of Khandava, the<br>Danavas and Rakshasas and Nagas and wolves and bears and other wild<br>animals, and elephants with rent temples, and tigers, and lions with<br>manes and deer and buffaloes by hundreds, and birds, and various other<br>creatures, frightened at the falling stones and extremely anxious, began<br>to fly in all directions. They saw the forest (burning all around) and<br>Krishna and Arjuna also ready with their weapons. Frightened at the<br>terrible sounds that were audible there those creatures lost their power<br>of movement. Beholding the forest burning in innumerable places and<br>Krishna also ready to smite them down with his weapons, they all set up a<br>frightful roar. With that terrible clamour as also with the roar of fire,<br>the whole welkin resounded, as it were, with the voice of portentous<br>clouds. Kesava of dark hue and mighty arms, in order to compass their<br>destruction, hurled at them his large and fierce discus resplendent with<br>its own energy. The forest-dwellers including the Danavas and the<br>Rakshasas, afflicted by that weapon, were cut in hundreds of pieces and<br>fell unto the mouth of Agni. Mangled by Krishna's discus, the Asuras were<br>besmeared with blood and fat and looked like evening clouds. And, O<br>Bharata, he of the Vrishni race moved able like death itself, slaying<br>Pisachas and birds and Nagas and other creatures by thousands. The discus<br>itself, repeatedly hurled from the hands of Krishna, that slayer of all<br>foes, came back to his hands after slaughtering numberless creatures. The<br>face and form of Krishna that soul of every created thing&#8212;became fierce<br>to behold while he was thus employed in the slaughter of the Pisachas,<br>Nagas and Rakshasas. No one among the celestials, who had mustered there<br>could vanquish in battle Krishna and Arjuna. When the celestials saw that<br>they could not protect that forest from the might of Krishna and Arjuna<br>by extinguishing that conflagration, they retired from the scene. Then, O<br>monarch, he of a hundred sacrifices (Indra), beholding the immortals<br>retreat, became filled with joy and applauded Krishna and Arjuna. And<br>when the celestials gave up the fight, an incorporeal voice, deep and<br>loud, addressing him of a hundred sacrifices, said, 'Thy friend Takshaka,<br>that chief of snakes, hath not been slain! Before the conflagration<br>commenced in Khandava he had journeyed to Kurukshetra. Know from my<br>words, O Vasava, that Vasudeva and Arjuna are incapable of being<br>vanquished in battle by any one! They are Nara and Narayana&#8212;those gods<br>of old heard of in heaven! Thou knowest what their energy is and what<br>their prowess. Invincible in battle, these best of old Rishis are<br>unconquerable by any one in all the worlds! They deserve the most<br>reverential worship of all the celestials and Asuras; of Yakshas and<br>Rakshasas and Gandharvas, of human beings and Kinnaras and Nagas.<br>Therefore, O Vasava, it behoveth thee to go hence with all the<br>celestials. The destruction of Khandava hath been ordained by Fate!' Then<br>the chief of the immortals, ascertaining those words to be true abandoned<br>his wrath and jealousy, and went back to heaven. The dwellers in heaven,<br>O monarch, beholding the illustrious Indra abandon the fight, followed<br>him with all their soldiers. Then those heroes, Vasudeva and Arjuna, when<br>they saw the chief of the celestials retreat accompanied by all the gods,<br>set up a leonine roar. And, O monarch, Kesava and Arjuna, after Indra had<br>left the scene, became exceedingly glad. Those heroes then fearlessly<br>assisted at the conflagration of the forest. Arjuna scattered the<br>celestials like the wind scattering the clouds, and slew with showers of<br>his arrows, numberless creatures that dwelt in Khandava. Cut off by<br>Arjuna's arrows, no one amongst the innumerable creatures could escape<br>from the burning forest. Far from fighting with him, none amongst even<br>the strongest creatures mustered there could look at Arjuna whose weapons<br>were never futile. Sometimes piercing hundred creatures with one shaft<br>and sometimes a single creature with hundred shafts, Arjuna moved about<br>in his car. The creatures themselves, deprived of life, began to fall<br>into the mouth of Agni (god of fire), struck down as it were by death<br>itself. On the banks of rivers or on uneven plains or on crematoriums, go<br>where they did, the creatures (dwelling in Khandava) found no ease, for<br>wherever they sought shelter there they were afflicted by the heat. And<br>hosts of creatures roared in pain, and elephants and deer and wolves set<br>up cries of affliction. At that sound the fishes of the Ganges and the<br>sea, and the various tribes of Vidyadharas dwelling in that forest all<br>became frightened. O thou of mighty arms, let alone battling with them,<br>no one, could even gaze at Arjuna and Janardana of dark hue. Hari slew<br>with his discus those Rakshasas and Danavas and Nagas that rushed at him<br>in bands. Of huge bodies, their heads and trunks were cut off by the<br>swift motion of the discus, and deprived of life they fell down into the<br>blazing fire. Gratified with large quantities of flesh, blood, and fat,<br>the flames rose up to a great height without a curling wreath of smoke.<br>Hutasana (fire-god) with blazing and coppery eyes, and flaming tongue and<br>large mouth, and the hair on the crown of his head all fiery, drinking,<br>with the help of Krishna and Arjuna, that nectar-like stream of animal<br>fat, became filled with joy. Gratified greatly, Agni derived much<br>happiness.<br><br>"And it so happened that the slayer of Madhu suddenly beheld an Asura of<br>the name of Maya escaping from the abode of Takshaka. Agni having Vayu<br>for his car-driver, assuming a body with matted locks on head, and<br>roaring like the clouds, pursued the Asura, desirous of consuming him.<br>Beholding the Asura, Vasudeva stood with his weapon upraised, ready to<br>smite him down, seeing the discus uplifted and Agni pursuing from behind<br>to burn him, Maya said 'Run to me, O Arjuna, and protect me!' Hearing his<br>affrighted voice Arjuna said, 'Fear not!' That voice of Arjuna, O<br>Bharata, seemed to give Maya his life. As the merciful son of Pritha said<br>unto Maya that there was nothing to fear, he of the Dasarha race no<br>longer desired to slay Maya who was the brother of Namuchi, and Agni also<br>burned him not.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Protected from Indra by Krishna and Partha,<br>Agni gifted with great intelligence, burned that forest for five and ten<br>days. And while the forest burned Agni spared only six of its dwellers,<br>viz., Aswasena, Maya, and four birds called Sarngakas.'"
