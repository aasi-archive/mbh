                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, "Beholding his five handsome sons growing up before<br>him in that great forest on the charming mountain slope, Pandu felt the<br>last might of his arms revive once more. One day in the season of spring<br>which maddens every creature the king accompanied by his wife (Madri),<br>began to rove in the woods where every tree had put forth new blossoms.<br>He beheld all around Palasas and Tilakas and Mangoes and Champakas and<br>Parihadrakas and Karnikaras, Asokas and Kesaras and Atimuktas and<br>Kuruvakas with swarms of maddened bees sweetly humming about. And there<br>were flowers of blossoming Parijatas with the Kokilas pouring forth their<br>melodies from under every twig echoing with the sweet hums of the black<br>bees. And he beheld also various other kinds of trees bent down with the<br>weight of their flowers and fruits. And there were also many fine pools<br>of water overgrown with hundreds of fragrant lotuses. Beholding all<br>these, Pandu felt the soft influence of desire. Roving like a celestial<br>with a light heart amidst such scenery, Pandu was alone with his wife<br>Madri in semi-transparent attire. And beholding the youthful Madri thus<br>attired, the king's desire flamed up like a forest-fire. And ill-able to<br>suppress his desire thus kindled at the sight of his wife of eyes like<br>lotus-petals, he was completely overpowered. The king then seized her<br>against her will, but Madri trembling in fear resisted him to the best of<br>her might. Consumed by desire, he forgot everything about his misfortune.<br>And, O thou of Kuru's race unrestrained by the fear of (the Rishi's)<br>curse and impelled by fate, the monarch, overpowered by passion, forcibly<br>sought the embraces of Madri, as if he wished to put an end to his own<br>life. His reason, thus beguiled by the great Destroyer himself by<br>intoxicating his senses, was itself lost with his life. And the Kuru king<br>Pandu, of virtuous soul, thus succumbed to the inevitable influence of<br>Time, while united in intercourse with his wife.<br><br>"Then Madri, clasping the body of her senseless lord, began to weep<br>aloud. And Kunti with her sons and the twins of Madri, hearing those<br>cries of grief, came to the spot where the king lay in that state. Then,<br>O king, Madri addressing Kunti in a piteous voice, said, 'Come hither<br>alone, O Kunti, and let the children stay there.' Hearing these words,<br>Kunti, bidding the children stay, ran with speed, exclaiming, 'Woe to<br>me!' And beholding both Pandu and Madri lying prostrate on the ground she<br>went in grief and affliction, saying, 'Of passions under complete<br>control, this hero, O Madri, had all along been watched by me with care.<br>How did he then forgetting the Rishi's curse, approach thee with<br>enkindled desire? O Madri, this foremost of men should have been<br>protected by thee. Why didst thou tempt him into solitude? Always<br>melancholy at the thought of the Rishi's curse, how came he to be merry<br>with thee in solitude? O princess of Valhika, more fortunate than myself,<br>thou art really to be envied, for thou hast seen the face of our lord<br>suffused with gladness and joy.'<br><br>"Madri then replied, saying, 'Revered sister, with tears in my eyes, I<br>resisted the king, but he could not control himself, bent on, as it were<br>making the Rishi's curse true.'<br><br>"Kunti then said, 'I am the older of his wedded wives; the chief<br>religious merit must be mine. Therefore, O Madri, prevent me not from<br>achieving that which must be achieved. I must follow our lord to the<br>region of the dead. Rise up, O Madri, and yield me his body. Rear thou<br>these children.' Madri replied, saying, 'I do clasp our lord yet, and<br>have not allowed him to depart; therefore, I shall follow him. My<br>appetite hath not been appeased. Thou art my older sister, O let me have<br>thy sanction. This foremost one of the Bharata princes had approached me,<br>desiring to have intercourse. His appetite unsatiated, shall I not follow<br>him in the region of Yama to gratify him? O revered one, if I survive<br>thee, it is certain I shall not be able to rear thy children as if they<br>were mine. Will not sin touch me on that account? But, thou, O Kunti,<br>shall be able to bring my sons up as if they were thine. The king, in<br>seeking me wishfully, hath gone to the region of spirits; therefore, my<br>body should be burnt with his. O revered sister, withhold not thy<br>sanction to this which is agreeable to me. Thou wilt certainly bring up<br>the children carefully. That indeed, would be very agreeable to me. I<br>have no other direction to give!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said this, the daughter of the king of<br>Madras, the wedded wife of Pandu, ascended the funeral pyre of her lord,<br>that bull among men.'"
