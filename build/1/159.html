                            (Vaka-vadha Parva)<br><br>"Janamejaya asked, 'O first of Brahmanas, what did the Pandavas, those<br>mighty car-warriors, the sons of Kunti, do after arriving at Ekachakra?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Those mighty car-warriors, the sons of Kunti, on<br>arriving at Ekachakra, lived for a short time in the abode of a Brahmana.<br>Leading an eleemosynary life, they behold (in course of their wanderings)<br>various delightful forests and earthly regions, and many rivers and<br>lakes, and they became great favourites of the inhabitants of that town<br>in consequence of their own accomplishments. At nightfall they placed<br>before Kunti all they gathered in their mendicant tours, and Kunti used<br>to divide the whole amongst them, each taking what was allotted to him.<br>And those heroic chastisers of foes, with their mother, together took one<br>moiety of the whole, while the mighty Bhima alone took the other moiety.<br>In this way, O bull of Bharata's race, the illustrious Pandavas lived<br>there for some time.<br><br>"One day, while those bulls of the Bharata race were out on their tour of<br>mendicancy, it so happened that Bhima was (at home) with (his mother)<br>Pritha. That day, O Bharata, Kunti heard a loud and heart-rending wail of<br>sorrow coming from within the apartments of the Brahmana. Hearing the<br>inmates of the Brahmana's house wailing and indulging in piteous<br>lamentations, Kunti, O king, from compassion and the goodness of her<br>heart, could not bear it with indifference. Afflicted with sorrow, the<br>amiable Pritha, addressing Bhima, said these words full of compassion.<br>'Our woes assuaged, we are, O son, living happily in the house of this<br>Brahmana, respected by him and unknown to Dhritarashtra's son. O son, I<br>always think of the good I should do to this Brahmana, like what they do<br>that live happily in others' abodes! O child, he is a true man upon whom<br>favours are never lost. He payeth back to others more than what he<br>receiveth at their hands. There is no doubt, some affliction hath<br>overtaken this Brahmana. If we could be of any help to him, we should<br>then be requiting his services.'<br><br>"Hearing these words of his mother, Bhima said, 'Ascertain, O mother the<br>nature of the Brahmana's distress and whence also it hath arisen.<br>Learning all about it, relieve it I will however difficult may the task<br>prove.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued 'While mother and son were thus talking with each<br>other, they heard again, O king, another wail of sorrow proceeding from<br>the Brahmana and his wife. Then Kunti quickly entered the inner<br>apartments of that illustrious Brahmana, like unto a cow running towards<br>her tethered calf. She beheld the Brahmana with his wife, son and<br>daughter, sitting with a woeful face, and she heard the Brahmana say,<br>'Oh, fie on this earthly life which is hollow as the reed and so<br>fruitless after all which is based on sorrow and hath no freedom, and<br>which hath misery for its lot! Life is sorrow and disease; life is truly<br>a record of misery! The soul is one: but it hath to pursue virtue, wealth<br>and pleasure. And because these are pursued at one and the same time,<br>there frequently occurs a disagreement that is the source of much misery.<br>Some say that salvation is the highest object of our desire. But I<br>believe it can never be attained. The acquisition of wealth is hell; the<br>pursuit of wealth is attended with misery; there is more misery after one<br>has acquired it, for one loves one's possessions, and if any mishap<br>befalls them, the possessor becomes afflicted with woe. I do not see by<br>what means I can escape from this danger, nor how I can fly hence, with<br>my wife to some region free from danger. Remember, O wife, that I<br>endeavoured to migrate to some other place where we would be happy, but<br>thou didst not then listen to me. Though frequently solicited by me,<br>thou, O simple woman, said to me, 'I have been born here, and here have I<br>grown old; this is my ancestral homestead.' Thy venerable father, O wife,<br>and thy mother also, have, a long time ago, ascended to heaven. Thy<br>relations also had all been dead. Oh why then didst thou yet like to live<br>here? Led by affection for thy relatives thou didst not then hear what I<br>said. But the time is now come when thou art to witness the death of a<br>relative. Oh, how sad is that spectacle for me! Or perhaps the time is<br>come for my own death, for I shall never be able to abandon cruelly one<br>of my own as long as I myself am alive. Thou art my helpmate in all good<br>deeds, self-denying and always affectionate unto me as a mother. The gods<br>have given thee to me as a true friend and thou art ever my prime stay.<br>Thou hast, by my parents, been made the participator in my domestic<br>concerns. Thou art of pure lineage and good disposition, the mother of<br>children, devoted to me, and so innocent; having chosen and wedded thee<br>with due rites, I cannot abandon thee, my wife, so constant in thy vows,<br>to save my life. How shall I myself be able to sacrifice my son a child<br>of tender years and yet without the hirsute appendages (of manhood)? How<br>shall I sacrifice my daughter whom I have begotten myself, who hath been<br>placed, as a pledge, in my hands by the Creator himself for bestowal on a<br>husband and through whom I hope to enjoy, along with my ancestors, the<br>regions attainable by those only that have daughters' sons? Some people<br>think that the father's affection for a son is greater; others, that his<br>affection for a daughter is greater, mine, however, is equal. How can I<br>be prepared to give up the innocent daughter upon whom rest the regions<br>of bliss obtainable by me in after life and my own lineage and perpetual<br>happiness? If, again, I sacrifice myself and go to the other world, I<br>should scarcely know any peace, for, indeed, it is evident that, left by<br>me these would not be able to support life. The sacrifice of any of these<br>would be cruel and censurable. On the other hand, if I sacrifice myself,<br>these, without me, will certainly perish. The distress into which I have<br>fallen is great; nor do I know the means of escape. Alas, what course<br>shall I take today with my near ones. It is well that I should die with<br>all these, for I can live no longer.'"
