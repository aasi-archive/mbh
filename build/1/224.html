                            (Khandava-daha Parva)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'The Pandavas, after they had taken up their abode at<br>Indraprastha at the command of Dhritarashtra and Bhishma began to bring<br>other kings under their sway. All the subjects (of the kingdom) lived<br>most happily depending upon Yudhishthira the just, like a soul living<br>happily depending upon a body blest with auspicious marks and pious<br>deeds. And, O bull in Bharata's race, Yudhishthira paid homage unto<br>virtue, pleasure, and profit, in judicious proportion, as if each were a<br>friend dear unto him as his own self. It seemed as if the three<br>pursuits&#8212;virtue, pleasure, and profit&#8212;became personified on earth, and<br>amongst them the king shone as a fourth. The subjects having obtained<br>Yudhishthira as their king, obtained in their monarch one that was<br>devoted to the study of the Vedas, one that was performer of the great<br>sacrifices, and one that was protector of all good people. In consequence<br>of Yudhishthira's influence, the good fortune of all the monarchs of the<br>earth became stationary, and their hearts became devoted to the<br>meditation of the Supreme Spirit, and virtue itself began to grow every<br>way all round. And in the midst of and assisted by his four brothers, the<br>king looked more resplendent (than he would have done if he were alone),<br>like a great sacrifice depending upon and assisted by the four Vedas.<br>Many learned Brahmanas with Dhananjaya at their head, each like unto<br>Vrihaspati, waited upon the monarch, like the celestials waiting upon the<br>Lord of the creation. From excess of affection, the eyes and hearts of<br>all the people equally took great delight in Yudhishthira who was even as<br>the full moon without a stain. The people took delight in him not only<br>because he was their king but also from sincere affection. The king<br>always did what was agreeable to them. The sweet-speeched Yudhishthira of<br>great intelligence never uttered anything that was improper or untrue or<br>unbearable or disagreeable. The best of monarchs of the Bharata race,<br>endued with great energy, passed his days happily for the welfare of all<br>as his own. His brothers also bringing by their energy other kings under<br>their sway, passed their days in happiness, without a foe to disturb<br>their peace.<br><br>"After a few days, Vibhatsu, addressing Krishna, said, 'The summer days<br>have set in, O Krishna! Therefore, let us go to the banks of the Yamuna.<br>O slayer of Madhu, sporting there in the company of friends, we will, O<br>Janardana, return in the evening'. Thereupon Vasudeva said, 'O son of<br>Kunti, this is also my wish. Let us, O Partha, sport in the waters as we<br>please, in the company of friends.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then, O Bharata, having consulted thus with<br>each other, Partha and Govinda, with Yudhishthira's leave, set out,<br>surrounded by friends. Reaching a fine spot (on the banks of the Yamuna)<br>suitable for purposes of pleasure, overgrown with numerous tall trees and<br>covered with several high mansions that made the place look like the<br>celestial city and within which had been collected for Krishna and Partha<br>numerous costly and well-flavoured viands and drinks and other articles<br>of enjoyment and floral wreaths and various perfumes, the party entered<br>without delay the inner apartments adorned with many precious gems of<br>pure rays. Entering those apartments, everybody, O Bharata, began to<br>sport, according to his pleasure. The women of the party, all of full<br>rotund hips and deep bosoms and handsome eyes, and gait unsteady with<br>wine began to sport there at the command of Krishna and Partha. Some<br>amongst the women sported as they liked in the woods, some in the waters,<br>and some within the mansions, as directed by Partha and Govinda. Draupadi<br>and Subhadra, exhilarated with wine, began to give away unto the women so<br>sporting, their costly robes and ornaments. And some amongst those women<br>began to dance in joy, and some began to sing; and some amongst them<br>began to laugh and jest, and some to drink excellent wines. Some began to<br>obstruct one another's progress and some to fight with one another, and<br>to discourse with one another in private. Those mansions and the woods,<br>filled with the charming music of flutes and guitars and kettledrums,<br>became the scene of Prosperity personified.<br><br>"When such was the state of things there, Arjuna and Vasudeva went to a<br>certain charming spot (in those woods) not far from the place where the<br>others were. O monarch, the high-souled Krishna, and that subjugators of<br>hostile cities, viz., Arjuna, going thither, sat down upon two very<br>costly seats. Vasudeva and Partha amused themselves there with<br>discoursing upon many past achievements of prowess and other topics. Unto<br>Vasudeva and Dhananjaya happily sitting there like the Aswins in heaven,<br>a certain Brahmana came. The Brahmana that came there looked like a tall<br>Sala tree. His complexion was like unto molten gold; his beard was bright<br>yellow tinged with green; and the height and the thickness of the body<br>were in just proportion. Of matted locks and dressed in rags, he<br>resembled the morning sun in splendour. Of eyes like lotus-petals and of<br>a tawny hue, he seemed to be blazing with effulgence. Beholding that<br>foremost of Brahmanas blazing with splendour approach towards them both<br>Arjuna and Vasudeva, hastily rising from their seats, stood, waiting (for<br>his commands).'"
