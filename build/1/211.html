                            (Rajya-labha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing these words of Yudhishthira, Narada replied,<br>'O son of Pritha, listen with thy brothers to me as I recite this old<br>story, O Yudhishthira, exactly as everything happened. In olden days, a<br>mighty Daitya named Nikumbha, endued with great energy and strength was<br>born in the race of the great Asura, Hiranyakasipu. Unto this Nikumbha,<br>were born two sons called Sunda and Upasunda. Both of them were mighty<br>Asuras endued with great energy and terrible prowess. The brothers were<br>both fierce and possessed of wicked hearts. And those Daityas were both<br>of the same resolution, and ever engaged in achieving the same tasks and<br>ends. They were ever sharers with each other in happiness as well as in<br>woe. Each speaking and doing what was agreeable to the other, the<br>brothers never were unless they were together, and never went anywhere<br>unless together. Of exactly the same disposition and habits, they seemed<br>to be one individual divided into two parts. Endued with great energy and<br>ever of the same resolution in everything they undertook, the brothers<br>gradually grew up. Always entertaining the same purpose, desirous of<br>subjugating the three worlds, the brothers, after due initiation, went to<br>the mountains of Vindhya. And severe were the ascetic penances they<br>performed there. Exhausted with hunger and thirst, with matted locks on<br>their heads and attired in barks of trees, they acquired sufficient<br>ascetic merit at length. Besmearing themselves with dirt from head to<br>foot, living upon air alone, standing on their toes, they threw pieces of<br>the flesh of their bodies into the fire. Their arms upraised, and eye<br>fixed, long was the period for which they observed their vows. And during<br>the course of their ascetic penances, a wonderful incident occurred<br>there. For the mountains of Vindhya, heated for a long course of years by<br>the power of their ascetic austerities, began to emit vapour from every<br>part of their bodies. And beholding the severity of their austerities,<br>the celestials became alarmed. The gods began to cause numerous<br>obstructions to impede the progress of their asceticism. The celestials<br>repeatedly tempted the brothers by means of every precious possession and<br>the most beautiful girls. The brothers broke not their vows. Then the<br>celestials once more manifested, before the illustrious brothers, their<br>powers of illusion. For it seemed their sisters, mothers, wives, and<br>other relatives, with disordered hair and ornaments and robes, were<br>running towards them in terror, pursued and struck by a Rakshasa with a<br>lance in hand. And it seemed that the women implored the help of the<br>brothers crying, 'O save us!' But all this went for nothing, for firmly<br>wedded thereto, the brothers did not still break their vows. And when it<br>was found that all this produced not the slightest impression on any of<br>the two, both the women and the Rakshasa vanished from sight. At last the<br>Grandsire himself, the Supreme Lord ever seeking the welfare of all, came<br>unto those great Asuras and asked them to solicit the boon they desired.<br>Then the brothers Sunda and Upasunda, both of great prowess, beholding<br>the Grandsire, rose from their seats and waited with joined palms. And<br>the brothers both said unto the God, 'O Grandsire, if thou hast been<br>pleased with these our ascetic austerities, and art, O lord, propitious<br>unto us, then let us have knowledge of all weapons and of all powers of<br>illusion. Let us be endued with great strength, and let us be able to<br>assume any form at will. And last of all, let us also be immortal.'<br>Hearing these words of theirs, Brahman said, 'Except the immortality you<br>ask for, you shall be given all that you desire. Solicit you some form of<br>death by which you may still be equal unto the immortals. And since you<br>have undergone these severe ascetic austerities from desire of<br>sovereignty alone I cannot confer on you the boon of immortality. You<br>have performed your ascetic penances even for the subjugation of the<br>three worlds. It is for this, O mighty Daityas, that I cannot grant you<br>what you desire.'<br><br>"Narada continued, 'Hearing these words of Brahman, Sunda and Upasunda<br>said, 'O Grandsire, let us have no fear then from any created thing,<br>mobile or immobile, in the three worlds, except only from each other!'<br>The Grandsire then said, 'I grant you what you have asked for, even this<br>your desire'. And granting them this boon, the Grandsire made them desist<br>from their asceticism, and returned to his own region. Then the brothers,<br>those mighty Daityas, having received those several boons became<br>incapable of being slain by anybody in the universe. They then returned<br>to their own abode. All their friends and relatives, beholding those<br>Daityas of great intelligence, crowned with success in the matter of the<br>boons they had obtained, became exceedingly glad. And Sunda and Upasunda<br>then cut off their matted locks and wore coronets on their heads. Attired<br>in costly robes and ornaments, they looked exceedingly handsome. They<br>caused the moon to rise over their city every night even out of his<br>season. And friends and relatives gave themselves up to joy and merriment<br>with happy hearts. Eat, feed, give, make merry, sing, drink&#8212;these were<br>the sounds heard everyday in every house. And here and there arose loud<br>uproars of hilarity mixed with clappings of hands which filled the whole<br>city of the Daityas, who being capable of assuming any form at will, were<br>engaged in every kind of amusement and sport and scarcely noticed the<br>flight of time, even regarding a whole year as a single day.'"
