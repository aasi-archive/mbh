                            (Jatugriha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said," As the mighty Bhima proceeded, the whole forest with<br>its trees and their branches seemed to tremble, in consequence of their<br>clash with his breast. The motion of his thighs raised a wind like unto<br>that which blows during the months of Jyaishtha and Ashadha (May and<br>June). And the mighty Bhima proceeded, making a path for himself, but<br>treading down the trees and creepers before him. In fact, he broke (by<br>the pressure of his body) the large trees and plants, with their flowers<br>and fruits, standing on his way. Even so passeth through the woods<br>breaking down mighty trees, the leader of a herd of elephants, of the age<br>of sixty years, angry and endued with excess of energy, during the season<br>of rut when the liquid juice trickle down the three parts of his body.<br>Indeed, so great was the force with which Bhima endued with the speed of<br>Garuda or of Marut (the god of wind), proceeded that the Pandavas seemed<br>to faint in consequence. Frequently swimming across streams difficult of<br>being crossed, the Pandavas disguised themselves on their way from fear<br>of the sons of Dhritarashtra. And Bhima carried on his shoulder his<br>illustrious mother of delicate sensibilities along the uneven banks of<br>rivers. Towards the evening, O bull of Bharata's race, Bhima (bearing his<br>brothers and mother on his back) reached a terrible forest where fruits<br>and roots and water were scarce and which resounded with the terrible<br>cries of birds and beasts. The twilight deepened the cries of birds and<br>beasts became fiercer, darkness shrouded everything from the view and<br>untimely winds began to blow that broke and laid low many a tree large<br>and small and many creepers with dry leaves and fruits. The Kaurava<br>princes, afflicted with fatigue and thirst, and heavy with sleep, were<br>unable to proceed further. They then all sat down in that forest without<br>food and drink. Then Kunti, smitten with thirst, said unto her sons, 'I<br>am the mother of the five Pandavas and am now in their midst. Yet I am<br>burning with thirst!' Kunti repeatedly said this unto her sons. Hearing<br>these words, Bhima's heart, from affection for his mother, was warmed by<br>compassion and he resolved to go (along as before). Then Bhima,<br>proceeding through that terrible and extensive forest without a living<br>soul, saw a beautiful banian tree with widespreading branches. Setting<br>down there his brothers and mother, O bull of Bharata's race; he said<br>unto them, 'Rest you here, while I go in quest of water. I hear the sweet<br>cries of aquatic fowls. I think there must be a large pool here.'<br>Commanded, O Bharata, by his elder brother who said unto him, 'Go', Bhima<br>proceeded in the direction whence the cries of those aquatic fowls were<br>coming. And, O bull of Bharata's race, he soon came upon a lake and<br>bathed and slaked his thirst. And affectionate unto his brothers, he<br>brought for them, O Bharata, water by soaking his upper garments. Hastily<br>retracing his way over those four miles he came unto where his mother was<br>and beholding her he was afflicted with sorrow and began to sigh like a<br>snake. Distressed with grief at seeing his mother and brothers asleep on<br>the bare ground, Vrikodara began to weep, 'Oh, wretch that I am, who<br>behold my brothers asleep on the bare ground, what can befall me more<br>painful than this? Alas, they who formerly at Varanavata could not sleep<br>on the softest and costliest beds are now asleep on the bare ground! Oh,<br>what more painful sight shall I ever behold than that of Kunti&#8212;the<br>sister of Vasudeva, that grinder of hostile hosts&#8212;the daughter of<br>Kuntiraja,&#8212;herself decked with every auspicious mark, the<br>daughter-in-law of Vichitravirya,&#8212;the wife of the illustrious<br>Pandu,&#8212;the mother of us (five brothers),&#8212;resplendent as the filaments<br>of the lotus and delicate and tender and fit to sleep on the costliest<br>bed&#8212;thus asleep, as she should never be, on the bare ground! Oh, she who<br>hath brought forth these sons by Dharma and Indra and Maruta&#8212;she who<br>hath ever slept within palaces&#8212;now sleepeth, fatigued, on the bare<br>ground! What more painful sight shall ever be beheld by me than that of<br>these tigers among men (my brothers) asleep on the ground! Oh, the<br>virtuous Yudhishthira, who deserveth the sovereignty of the three worlds,<br>sleepeth, fatigued, like an ordinary man, on the bare ground! This Arjuna<br>of the darkish hue of blue clouds, and unequalled amongst men sleepeth on<br>the ground like an ordinary person! Oh, what can be more painful than<br>this? Oh the twins, who in beauty are like the twin Aswins amongst the<br>celestials, are asleep like ordinary mortals on the bare ground! He who<br>hath no jealous evil-minded relatives, liveth in happiness in this world<br>like a single tree in a village. The tree that standeth single in a<br>village with its leaves and fruits, from absence of other of the same<br>species, becometh sacred and is worshipped and venerated by all. They<br>again that have many relatives who, however, are all heroic and virtuous,<br>live happily in the world without sorrow of any kind. Themselves powerful<br>and growing in prosperity and always gladdening their friends and<br>relatives, they live, depending on each other, like tall trees growing in<br>the same forest. We, however, have been forced in exile by the wicked<br>Dhritarashtra and his sons having escaped with difficulty, from sheer<br>good fortune, a fiery death. Having escaped from that fire, we are now<br>resting in the shade of this tree. Having already suffered so much, where<br>now are we to go? Ye sons of Dhritarashtra of little foresight, ye wicked<br>fellows, enjoy your temporary success. The gods are certainly auspicious<br>to you. But ye wicked wretches, ye are alive yet, only because<br>Yudhishthira doth not command me to take your lives. Else this very day,<br>filled with wrath, I would send thee, (O Duryodhana), to the regions of<br>Yama (Pluto) with thy children and friends and brothers, and Karna, and<br>(Sakuni) the son of Suvala! But what can I do, for, ye sinful wretches,<br>the virtuous king Yudhishthira, the eldest of the Pandavas, is not yet<br>angry with you?'<br><br>"Having said this, Bhima of mighty arms, fired with wrath, began to<br>squeeze his palms, sighing deeply in affliction. Excited again with wrath<br>like an extinguished fire blazing up all on a sudden, Vrikodara once more<br>beheld his brothers sleeping on the ground like ordinary persons sleeping<br>in trustfulness. And Bhima said unto himself, 'I think there is some town<br>not far off from this forest. These all are asleep, so I will sit awake.<br>And this will slake their thirst after they rise refreshed from sleep.'<br>Saying this, Bhima sat there awake, keeping watch over his sleeping<br>mother and brothers.'"
