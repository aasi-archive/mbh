                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said. 'Then when the night had passed away and the sun had risen<br>in the morning, O thou whose wealth is asceticism, the two sisters Kadru<br>and Vinata, having laid a wager about slavery, went with haste and<br>impatience to view the steed Uchchaishravas from a near point. On their<br>way they saw the Ocean, that receptacle of waters, vast and deep, rolling<br>and tremendously roaring, full of fishes large enough to swallow the<br>whale, and abounding with huge makaras and creatures of various forms by<br>thousands, and rendered inaccessible by the presence of other terrible,<br>monster-shaped, dark, and fierce aquatic animals, abounding with<br>tortoises and crocodiles, the mine of all kinds of gems, the home of<br>Varuna (the water-God), the excellent and beautiful residence of the<br>Nagas, the lord of all rivers, the abode of the subterranean fire, the<br>friend (or asylum) of the Asuras, the terror of all creatures, the grand<br>reservoir of water, and ever immutable. It is holy, beneficial to the<br>gods, and is the great source of nectar; without limits, inconceivable,<br>sacred, and highly wonderful. It is dark, terrible with the sound of<br>aquatic creatures, tremendously roaring, and full of deep whirl-pools. It<br>is an object of terror to all creatures. Moved by the winds blowing from<br>its shores and heaving high, agitated and disturbed, it seems to dance<br>everywhere with uplifted hands represented by its surges. Full of<br>swelling billows caused by the waxing and waning of the moon the parent<br>of Vasudeva's great conch called Panchajanya, the great mine of gems, its<br>waters were formerly disturbed in consequence of the agitation caused<br>within them by the Lord Govinda of immeasurable prowess when he had<br>assumed the form of a wild boar for raising the (submerged) Earth. Its<br>bottom, lower than the nether regions, the vow observing regenerate Rishi<br>Atri could not fathom after (toiling for) a hundred years. It becomes the<br>bed of the lotus-naveled Vishnu when at the termination of every Yuga<br>that deity of immeasurable power enjoys yoga-nidra, the deep sleep under<br>the spell of spiritual meditation. It is the refuge of Mainaka fearful of<br>falling thunder, and the retreat of the Asuras overcome in fierce<br>encounters. It offers water as sacrificial butter to the blazing fire<br>issuing from the mouth of Varava (the Ocean-mare). It is fathomless and<br>without limits, vast and immeasurable, and the lord of rivers.<br><br>"And they saw that unto it rushed mighty rivers by thousands with proud<br>gait, like amorous competitors, each eager for meeting it, forestalling<br>the others. And they saw that it was always full, and always dancing in<br>its waves. And they saw that it was deep and abounding with fierce whales<br>and makaras. And it resounded constantly with the terrible sounds of<br>aquatic creatures. And they saw that it was vast, and wide as the expanse<br>of space, unfathomable, and limitless, and the grand reservoir of water.'"<br><br>And so ends the twenty-first section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.
