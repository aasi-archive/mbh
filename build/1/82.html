                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Yayati then, on returning to his capital which was<br>like unto the city of Indra, entered his inner apartments and established<br>there his bride Devayani. And the monarch, directed by Devayani,<br>established Vrishaparvan's daughter Sarmishtha in a mansion especially<br>erected near the artificial woods of Asokas in his gardens. And the king<br>surrounded Vrishaparvan's daughter Sarmishtha with a thousand maids and<br>honoured her by making every arrangement for her food and garments. But<br>it was with Devayani that the royal son of Nahusha sported like a<br>celestial for many years in joy and bliss. And when her season came, the<br>fair Devayani conceived. And she brought forth as her first child a fine<br>boy. And when a thousand years had passed away, Vrishaparvan's daughter<br>Sarmishtha having attained to puberty saw that her season had come. She<br>became anxious and said to herself, 'My season hath arrived. But I have<br>not yet chosen a husband. O, what hath happened, what should I do? How am<br>I to obtain the fruition of my wishes? Devayani hath become mother. My<br>youth is doomed to pass away in vain. Shall I choose him also for my<br>husband whom Devayani hath chosen? This is, indeed, my resolve: that<br>monarch should give me a son. Will not the virtuous one grant me a<br>private interview?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'While Sarmishtha was thus busy with her<br>thoughts, the king wandering listlessly came to that very wood of Asokas,<br>and beholding Sarmishtha before him, stood there in silence. Then<br>Sarmishtha of sweet smiles seeing the monarch before her with nobody to<br>witness what might pass, approached him and said with joined palms, 'O<br>son of Nahusha, no one can behold the ladies that dwell in the inner<br>apartments of Soma, of Indra, of Vishnu, of Yama, of Varuna, and of thee!<br>Thou knowest, O king, that I am both handsome and well-born. I solicit<br>thee, O king! My season hath arrived. See that it goeth not in vain.'<br><br>"Yayati answered, 'Well do I know that honour of birth is thine, born as<br>thou art in the proud race of the Danavas. Thou art also gifted with<br>beauty. I do not, indeed, see even the speck of a fault in thy feature.<br>But Usanas commanded me, while I was united with Devayani, that never<br>should Vrishaparvan's daughter he summoned to my bed.'<br><br>"Sarmishtha then said, 'It hath been said, O king, that it is not sinful<br>to lie on the occasion of a joke, in respect of women sought to be<br>enjoyed, on occasions of marriage, in peril of immediate death and of the<br>loss of one's whole fortune. Lying is excusable on these five occasions.<br>O king, it is not true that he is fallen who speaks not the truth when<br>asked. Both Devayani and myself have been called hither as companions to<br>serve the same purpose. When, therefore, thou hadst said that you wouldst<br>confine thyself to one only amongst as, that was a lie thou hadst<br>spoken.' Yayati replied, 'A king should ever be a model in the eyes of<br>his people. That monarch certainly meets with destruction who speaks an<br>untruth. As for myself, I dare not speak an untruth even if the greatest<br>loss threatens me!' Sarmishtha answered, 'O monarch, one may look upon<br>her friend's husband as her own. One's friend's marriage is the same as<br>one's own. Thou hast been chosen by my friend as her husband. Thou art as<br>much my husband, therefore.' Yayati then said, 'It is, indeed my vow<br>always to grant what one asketh. As thou askest me, tell me then what I<br>am to do.' Sarmishtha then said, 'Absolve me, O king, from sin. Protect<br>my virtue. Becoming a mother by thee, let me practise the highest virtue<br>in this world. It is said, O king, that a wife, a slave, and a son can<br>never earn wealth for themselves. What they earn always belongeth to him<br>who owneth them. I am, indeed, the slave of Devayani. Thou art Devayani's<br>master and lord. Thou art, therefore, O king, my master and lord as much<br>as Devayani's! I solicit thee! O, fulfil my wishes!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by Sarmishtha, the monarch was<br>persuaded into the truth of all she spoke. He therefore, honoured<br>Sarmishtha by protecting her virtue. And they passed some time together.<br>And taking affectionate farewell of each other, they then parted, each<br>returning to whence he or she had come.<br><br>"And it came to pass that Sarmishtha of sweet smiles and fair eyebrows<br>conceived in consequence of that connection of hers with that best of<br>monarchs. And, O king, that lotus-eyed lady then in due course of time<br>brought forth a son of the splendour of a celestial child and of eyes<br>like-lotus-petals.'"
