                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'When Devayani of sweet smiles heard of the birth of<br>this child, she became jealous, and O Bharata, Sarmishtha became an<br>object of her unpleasant reflections. And Devayani, repairing to her,<br>addressed her thus, 'O thou of fair eye-brows, what sin is this thou hast<br>committed by yielding to the influence of lust?' Sarmishtha replied, 'A<br>certain Rishi of virtuous soul and fully conversant with the Vedas came<br>to me. Capable of granting boons he was solicited by me to grant my<br>wishes that were based on considerations of virtue. O thou of sweet<br>smiles, I would not seek the sinful fulfilment of my desires. I tell thee<br>truly that this child of mine is by that Rishi!' Devayani answered, 'It<br>is all right if that be the case, O timid one! But if the lineage, name,<br>and family of that Brahmana be known to thee, I should like to hear<br>them.' Sarmishtha replied, 'O thou of sweet smiles, in asceticism and<br>energy, that Rishi is resplendent like the Sun himself. Beholding him, I<br>had not, any need to make these enquiries&#8212;' Devayani then said, 'If this<br>is true, if indeed, thou hast obtained thy child from such a superior<br>Brahmana, then, O Sarmishtha, I have no cause of anger.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having thus talked and laughed with each other,<br>they separated, Devayani returning to the palace with the knowledge<br>imparted to her by Sarmishtha. And, O king, Yayati also begot on Devayani<br>two sons called Yadu and Turvasu, who were like Indra and Vishnu. And<br>Sarmishtha, the daughter of Vrishaparvan, became through the royal sage<br>the mother of three sons in all, named Drahyu, Anu, and Puru.<br><br>"And, O king, it so came to pass that one day Devayani of sweet smiles,<br>accompanied by Yayati, went into a solitary part of the woods, (in the<br>king's extensive park). And there she saw three children of celestial<br>beauty playing with perfect trustfulness. And Devayani asked in surprise,<br>'Whose children are they, O king, who are so handsome and so like unto<br>the children of the celestials? In splendour and beauty they are like<br>thee, I should think.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'And Devayani without waiting for a reply from<br>the king, asked the children themselves, 'Ye children, what is your<br>lineage? Who is your father? Answer me truly. I desire to know all.'<br>Those children then pointed at the king (with their forefingers) and<br>spoke of Sarmishtha as their mother.<br><br>"And having so said, the children approached the king to clasp his knees.<br>But the king dared not caress them in the presence of Devayani. The boys<br>then left the place, and made towards their mother, weeping in grief. And<br>the king, at this conduct of the boys, became very much abashed. But<br>Devayani, marking the affection of the children for the king learnt the<br>secret and addressing Sarmishtha, said, 'How hast thou dared to do me an<br>injury, being, as thou art, dependent on me? Dost thou not fear to have<br>recourse once more to that Asura custom of thine?'<br><br>"Sarmishtha said, 'O thou of sweet smiles, all that I told thee of a<br>Rishi is perfectly true. I have acted rightly and according to the<br>precepts of virtue, and therefore, do I not fear thee. When thou hadst<br>chosen the king for thy husband, I, too, chose him as mine. O beautiful<br>one, a friend's husband is, according to usage, one's own husband as<br>well. Thou art the daughter of a Brahmana and, therefore, deservest my<br>worship and regard. But dost thou not know that this royal sage is held<br>by me in greater esteem still?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Devayani then, hearing those words of hers,<br>exclaimed, O king, thus, 'Thou hast wronged me, O monarch! I shall not<br>live here any longer.' And saying this, she quickly rose, with tearful<br>eyes, to go to her father. And the king was grieved to see her thus, and<br>alarmed greatly, followed in her foot-steps, endeavouring to appease her<br>wrath. But Devayani, with eyes red with anger, would not desist. Speaking<br>not a word to the king, with eyes bathed in tears, she soon reached the<br>side of her father Usanas, the son of Kavi. And beholding her father, she<br>stood before him, after due salutations. And Yayati also, immediately<br>after, saluted and worshipped Bhargava.'<br><br>"And Devayani said, 'O father, virtue hath been vanquished by vice. The<br>low have risen, and the high have fallen. I have been offended again by<br>Sarmishtha, the daughter of Vrishaparvan. Three sons have been begotten<br>upon her by this king Yayati. But, O father, being luckless I have got<br>only two sons! O son of Bhrigu, this king is renowned for his knowledge<br>of the precepts of religion. But, O Kavya, I tell thee that he hath<br>deviated from the path of rectitude.'<br><br>"Sukra, hearing all this, said, 'O monarch, since thou hast made vice thy<br>beloved pursuit, though fully acquainted with the precepts of religion,<br>invincible decrepitude shall paralyse thee!' Yayati answered, 'Adorable<br>one, I was solicited by the daughter of the Danava king to fructify her<br>season. I did it from a sense of virtue and not from other motives. That<br>male person, who being solicited by a woman in her season doth not grant<br>her wishes, is called, O Brahmana, by those conversant with the Vedas, a<br>slayer of the embryo. He who, solicited in secret by a woman full of<br>desire and in season, goeth not in unto her, loseth virtue and is called<br>by the learned a killer of the embryo, O son of Bhrigu, for these<br>reasons, and anxious to avoid sin, I went into Sarmishtha.' Sukra then<br>replied, 'Thou art dependent on me. Thou shouldst have awaited my<br>command. Having acted falsely in the matter of thy duty, O son of<br>Nahusha, thou hast been guilty of the sin of theft.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Yayati, the son of Nahusha, thus cursed by the<br>angry Usanas, was then divested of his youth and immediately overcome by<br>decrepitude. And Yayati said, 'O son of Bhrigu, I have not yet been<br>satiated with youth or with Devayani. Therefore, O Brahmana, be graceful<br>unto me so that decrepitude might not touch me.' Sukra then answered, 'I<br>never speak an untruth. Even now, O king, art thou attacked by<br>decrepitude. But if thou likest, thou art competent to transfer this thy<br>decrepitude to another.' Yayati said, 'O Brahmana, let it be commanded by<br>thee that that son of mine who giveth me his youth shall enjoy my<br>kingdom, and shall achieve both virtue and fame.' Sukra replied, 'O son<br>of Nahusha, thinking of me thou mayst transfer this thy decrepitude to<br>whomsoever thou likest. That son who shall give thee his youth shall<br>become thy successor to the throne. He shall also have long life, wide<br>fame, and numerous progeny!'"
