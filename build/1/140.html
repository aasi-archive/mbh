                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Beholding the Pandavas and the son of<br>Dhritarashtra accomplished in arms, Drona thought the time had come when<br>he could demand the preceptorial fee. And, O king, assembling his pupils<br>one day together, the preceptor Drona asked of them the fee, saying,<br>'Seize Drupada, the king of Panchala in battle and bring him unto me.<br>That shall be the most acceptable fee.' Those warriors then answering,<br>'So be it', speedily mounted up on their chariots, and for bestowing upon<br>their preceptor the fee he had demanded, marched out, accompanied by him.<br>Those bulls among men, smiting the Panchalas on their way, laid siege to<br>the capital of the great Drupada. And Duryodhana and Karna and the mighty<br>Yuyutsu, and Duhsasana and Vikarna and Jalasandha and Sulochana,&#8212;these<br>and many other foremost of Kshatriya princes of great prowess, vied with<br>one another in becoming the foremost in the attack. And the princes,<br>riding in first class chariots and following the cavalry, entered the<br>hostile capital, and proceeded along the streets.<br><br>"Meanwhile, the king of Panchala, beholding that mighty force and hearing<br>its loud clamour, came out of his palace, accompanied by his brothers.<br>Though king Yajnasena was well-armed, the Kuru army assailed him with a<br>shower of arrows, uttering their war-cry. Yajnasena, however, not easy to<br>be subdued in battle, approaching the Kurus upon his white chariot, began<br>to rain his fierce arrows around.<br><br>"Before the battle commenced, Arjuna, beholding the pride of prowess<br>displayed by the princes, addressed his preceptor, that best of<br>Brahmanas, Drona, and said, 'We shall exert ourselves after these have<br>displayed their prowess. The king of Panchala can never be taken on the<br>field of the battle by any of these. Having said this, the sinless son of<br>Kunti surrounded by his brothers, waited outside the town at a distance<br>of a mile from it. Meanwhile Drupada beholding the Kuru host, rushed<br>forward and pouring a fierce shower of arrows around, terribly afflicted<br>the Kuru ranks. And such was his lightness of motion on the field of<br>battle that, though he was fighting unsupported on a single chariot, the<br>Kurus from panic supposed that there were many Drupadas opposed to them.<br>And the fierce arrows of that monarch fell fast on all sides, till conchs<br>and trumpets and drums by thousands began to be sounded by the Panchalas<br>from their houses (giving the alarm). Then there arose from the mighty<br>Panchala host a roar terrible as that of the lion, while the twang of<br>their bow-strings seemed to rend the very heavens. Then Duryodhana and<br>Vikarna, Suvahu and Dirghalochana and Duhsasana becoming furious, began<br>to shower their arrows upon the enemy. But the mighty bowman, Prishata's<br>son, invincible in battle, though very much pierced with the arrows of<br>the enemy, instantly began, O Bharata, to afflict the hostile ranks with<br>greater vigour. And careering over the field of battle like a fiery<br>wheel, king Drupada with his arrows smote Duryodhana and Vikarna and even<br>the mighty Karna and many other heroic princes and numberless warriors,<br>and slaked their thirst for battle. Then all the citizens showered upon<br>the Kurus various missiles like clouds showering rain-drops upon the<br>earth. Young and old, they all rushed to battle, assailing the Kurus with<br>vigour. The Kauravas, then, O Bharata, beholding the battle become<br>frightful, broke and fled wailing towards the Pandavas.<br><br>"The Pandavas, hearing the terrible wail of the beaten host,<br>reverentially saluted Drona and ascended their chariots. Then Arjuna<br>hastily bidding Yudhishthira not to engage in the fight, rushed forward,<br>appointing the sons of Madri (Nakula and Sahadeva) the protectors of his<br>chariot-wheels, while Bhimasena ever fighting in the van, mace in hand,<br>ran ahead. The sinless Arjuna, thus accompanied by his brothers, hearing<br>the shouts of the enemy, advanced towards them, filling the whole region<br>with the rattle of his chariot-wheels. And like a Makara entering the<br>sea, the mighty-armed Bhima, resembling a second Yama, mace in hand,<br>entered the Panchala ranks, fiercely roaring like the ocean in a tempest.<br>And Bhima, mace in hand, first rushed towards the array of elephants in<br>the hostile force, while Arjuna, proficient in battle, assailed that<br>force with the prowess of his arms. And Bhima, like the great Destroyer<br>himself, began to slay those elephants with his mace. Those huge animals,<br>like unto mountains, struck with Bhima's mace, had their heads broken<br>into pieces. Covered with stream of blood, they began to fall upon the<br>ground like cliffs loosened by thunder. And the Pandavas prostrated on<br>the ground elephants and horses and cars by thousands and slew many<br>foot-soldiers and many car-warriors. Indeed, as a herdsman in the woods<br>driveth before him with his staff countless cattle with ease, so did<br>Vrikodara drive before him the chariots and elephants of the hostile<br>force.<br><br>"Meanwhile, Phalguna, impelled by the desire of doing good unto<br>Bharadwaja's son, assailed the son of Prishata with a shower of arrows<br>and felled him from the elephant on which he was seated. And, O monarch,<br>Arjuna, like unto the terrible fire that consumeth all things at the end<br>of the Yuga, began to prostrate on the ground horses and cars and<br>elephants by thousands. The Panchalas and the Srinjayas, on the other<br>hand, thus assailed by the Pandava, met him with a perfect shower of<br>weapons of various kinds. And they sent up a loud shout and fought<br>desperately with Arjuna. The battle became furious and terrible to<br>behold. Hearing the enemy's shouts, the son of Indra was filled with<br>wrath and assailing the hostile host with a thick shower of arrows,<br>rushed towards it furiously afflicting it with renewed vigour. They who<br>observed the illustrious Arjuna at that time could not mark any interval<br>between his fixing the arrows on the bowstring and letting them off. Loud<br>were the shouts that rose there, mingled with cheers of approval. Then<br>the king of the Panchalas, accompanied by (the generalissimo of his<br>forces) Satyajit, rushed with speed at Arjuna like the Asura Samvara<br>rushing at the chief of the celestials (in days of yore). Then Arjuna<br>covered the king of Panchala with a shower of arrows. Then there arose a<br>frightful uproar among the Panchala host like unto the roar of a mighty<br>lion springing at the leader of a herd of elephants. And beholding Arjuna<br>rushing at the king of Panchala to seize him, Satyajit of great prowess<br>rushed at him. And the two warriors, like unto Indra and the Asura<br>Virochana's son (Vali), approaching each other for combat, began to grind<br>each other's ranks. Then Arjuna with great force pierced Satyajit with<br>ten keen shafts at which feat the spectators were all amazed. But<br>Satyajit, without losing any time, assailed Arjuna with a hundred shafts.<br>Then that mighty car-warrior, Arjuna, endued with remarkable lightness of<br>motion, thus covered by that shower of arrows, rubbed his bow-string to<br>increase the force and velocity of his shafts. Then cutting in twain his<br>antagonist's bow, Arjuna rushed at the king of the Panchalas, but<br>Satyajit, quickly taking up a tougher bow, pierced with his arrows<br>Partha, his chariot, charioteer, and horses. Arjuna, thus assailed in<br>battle by the Panchala warrior, forgave not his foe. Eager to slay him at<br>once, he pierced with a number of arrows his antagonist's horses, flags,<br>bow, clenched (left) fist, charioteer, and the attendant at his back.<br>Then Satyajit, finding his bows repeatedly cut in twain and his horses<br>slain, desisted from the fight.<br><br>"The king of the Panchalas, beholding his general thus discomfited in the<br>encounter, himself began to shower his arrows upon the Pandava prince.<br>Then Arjuna, that foremost of warriors, crowned with success, began to<br>fight furiously, and quickly cutting his enemy's bow in twain as also his<br>flagstaff which he caused to fall down, pierced his antagonist's horses,<br>and charioteer also with five arrows. Then throwing aside his bow Arjuna<br>took his quiver, and taking out a scimitar and sending forth a loud<br>shout, leaped from his own chariot upon that of his foe. And standing<br>there with perfect fearlessness he seized Drupada as Garuda seizeth a<br>huge snake after agitating the waters of the ocean. At the sight of this,<br>the Panchala troops ran away in all directions.<br><br>"Then Dhananjaya, having thus exhibited the might of his arm in the<br>presence of both hosts, sent forth a loud shout and came out of the<br>Panchala ranks. And beholding him returning (with his captive), the<br>princes began to lay waste Drupada's capital. Addressing them Arjuna<br>said, 'This best of monarchs, Drupada, is a relative of the Kuru heroes.<br>Therefore, O Bhima, slay not his soldiers. Let us only give unto our<br>preceptor his fee.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'O king, thus prevented by Arjuna, the mighty<br>Bhimasena, though unsatiated with the exercise of battle, refrained from<br>the act of slaughter. And, O bull of the Bharata race, the princes then,<br>taking Drupada with them after having seized him on the field of battle<br>along with his friends and counsellors, offered him unto Drona. And Drona<br>beholding Drupada thus brought under complete control&#8212;humiliated and<br>deprived of wealth&#8212;remembered that monarch's former hostility and<br>addressing him said, 'Thy kingdom and capital have been laid waste by me.<br>But fear not for thy life, though it dependeth now on the will of thy<br>foe. Dost thou now desire to revive thy friendship (with me)?' Having<br>said this, he smiled a little and again said, 'Fear not for thy life,<br>brave king! We, Brahmanas, are ever forgiving. And, O bull among<br>Kshatriyas, my affection and love for thee have grown with me in<br>consequence of our having sported together in childhood in the hermitage.<br>Therefore, O king, I ask for thy friendship again. And as a boon<br>(unasked), I give thee half the kingdom (that was thine). Thou toldest me<br>before that none who was not a king could be a king's friend. Therefore<br>is it, O Yajnasena, that I retain half thy kingdom. Thou art the king of<br>all the territory lying on the southern side of the Bhagirathi, while I<br>become king of all the territory on the north of that river. And, O<br>Panchala, if it pleaseth thee, know me hence for thy friend.'<br><br>"On hearing these words, Drupada answered, 'Thou art of noble soul and<br>great prowess. Therefore, O Brahmana, I am not surprised at what thou<br>doest. I am very much gratified with thee, and I desire thy eternal<br>friendship.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'After this, O Bharata, Drona released the king<br>of Panchala, and cheerfully performing the usual offices of regard,<br>bestowed upon him half the kingdom. Thenceforth Drupada began to reside<br>sorrowfully in (the city of) Kampilya within (the province of) Makandi on<br>the banks of the Ganga filled with many towns and cities. And after his<br>defeat by Drona, Drupada also ruled the southern Panchalas up to the bank<br>of the Charmanwati river. And Drupada from that day was well-convinced<br>that he could not, by Kshatriya might alone, defeat Drona, being very<br>much his inferior in Brahma (spiritual) power. And he, therefore, began<br>to wander over the whole earth to find out the means of obtaining a son<br>(who would subjugate his Brahmana foe).<br><br>"Meanwhile Drona continued to reside in Ahicchatra. Thus, O king, was the<br>territory of Ahicchatra full of towns and cities, obtained by Arjuna, and<br>bestowed upon Drona.'
