                            "The Rishis said, 'O son of Suta, we wish to hear a full and<br>circumstantial account of the place mentioned by you as Samanta-panchaya.'<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Listen, O ye Brahmanas, to the sacred descriptions I utter<br>O ye best of men, ye deserve to hear of the place known as<br>Samanta-panchaka. In the interval between the Treta and Dwapara Yugas,<br>Rama (the son of Jamadagni) great among all who have borne arms, urged by<br>impatience of wrongs, repeatedly smote the noble race of Kshatriyas. And<br>when that fiery meteor, by his own valour, annihilated the entire tribe<br>of the Kshatriyas, he formed at Samanta-panchaka five lakes of blood. We<br>are told that his reason being overpowered by anger he offered oblations<br>of blood to the manes of his ancestors, standing in the midst of the<br>sanguine waters of those lakes. It was then that his forefathers of whom<br>Richika was the first having arrived there addressed him thus, 'O Rama, O<br>blessed Rama, O offspring of Bhrigu, we have been gratified with the<br>reverence thou hast shown for thy ancestors and with thy valour, O mighty<br>one! Blessings be upon thee. O thou illustrious one, ask the boon that<br>thou mayst desire.'<br><br>"Rama said, 'If, O fathers, ye are favourably disposed towards me, the<br>boon I ask is that I may be absolved from the sins born of my having<br>annihilated the Kshatriyas in anger, and that the lakes I have formed may<br>become famous in the world as holy shrines.' The Pitris then said, 'So<br>shall it be. But be thou pacified.' And Rama was pacified accordingly.<br>The region that lieth near unto those lakes of gory water, from that time<br>hath been celebrated as Samanta-panchaka the holy. The wise have declared<br>that every country should be distinguished by a name significant of some<br>circumstance which may have rendered it famous. In the interval between<br>the Dwapara and the Kali Yugas there happened at Samanta-panchaka the<br>encounter between the armies of the Kauravas and the Pandavas. In that<br>holy region, without ruggedness of any kind, were assembled eighteen<br>Akshauhinis of soldiers eager for battle. And, O Brahmanas, having come<br>thereto, they were all slain on the spot. Thus the name of that region, O<br>Brahmanas, hath been explained, and the country described to you as a<br>sacred and delightful one. I have mentioned the whole of what relateth to<br>it as the region is celebrated throughout the three worlds.'<br><br>"The Rishis said, 'We have a desire to know, O son of Suta, what is<br>implied by the term Akshauhini that hath been used by thee. Tell us in<br>full what is the number of horse and foot, chariots and elephants, which<br>compose an Akshauhini for thou art fully informed.'<br><br>"Sauti said, 'One chariot, one elephant, five foot-soldiers, and three<br>horses form one Patti; three pattis make one Sena-mukha; three<br>sena-mukhas are called a Gulma; three gulmas, a Gana; three ganas, a<br>Vahini; three vahinis together are called a Pritana; three pritanas form<br>a Chamu; three chamus, one Anikini; and an anikini taken ten times forms,<br>as it is styled by those who know, an Akshauhini. O ye best of Brahmanas,<br>arithmeticians have calculated that the number of chariots in an<br>Akshauhini is twenty-one thousand eight hundred and seventy. The measure<br>of elephants must be fixed at the same number. O ye pure, you must know<br>that the number of foot-soldiers is one hundred and nine thousand, three<br>hundred and fifty, the number of horse is sixty-five thousand, six<br>hundred and ten. These, O Brahmanas, as fully explained by me, are the<br>numbers of an Akshauhini as said by those acquainted with the principles<br>of numbers. O best of Brahmanas, according to this calculation were<br>composed the eighteen Akshauhinis of the Kaurava and the Pandava army.<br>Time, whose acts are wonderful assembled them on that spot and having<br>made the Kauravas the cause, destroyed them all. Bhishma acquainted with<br>choice of weapons, fought for ten days. Drona protected the Kaurava<br>Vahinis for five days. Kama the desolator of hostile armies fought for<br>two days; and Salya for half a day. After that lasted for half a day the<br>encounter with clubs between Duryodhana and Bhima. At the close of that<br>day, Aswatthaman and Kripa destroyed the army of Yudishthira in the night<br>while sleeping without suspicion of danger.<br><br>'O Saunaka, this best of narrations called Bharata which has begun to be<br>repeated at thy sacrifice, was formerly repeated at the sacrifice of<br>Janamejaya by an intelligent disciple of Vyasa. It is divided into<br>several sections; in the beginning are Paushya, Pauloma, and Astika<br>parvas, describing in full the valour and renown of kings. It is a work<br>whose description, diction, and sense are varied and wonderful. It<br>contains an account of various manners and rites. It is accepted by the<br>wise, as the state called Vairagya is by men desirous of final release.<br>As Self among things to be known, as life among things that are dear, so<br>is this history that furnisheth the means of arriving at the knowledge of<br>Brahma the first among all the sastras. There is not a story current in<br>this world but doth depend upon this history even as the body upon the<br>foot that it taketh. As masters of good lineage are ever attended upon by<br>servants desirous of preferment so is the Bharata cherished by all poets.<br>As the words constituting the several branches of knowledge appertaining<br>to the world and the Veda display only vowels and consonants, so this<br>excellent history displayeth only the highest wisdom.<br><br>'Listen, O ye ascetics, to the outlines of the several divisions (parvas)<br>of this history called Bharata, endued with great wisdom, of sections and<br>feet that are wonderful and various, of subtile meanings and logical<br>connections, and embellished with the substance of the Vedas.<br><br>'The first parva is called Anukramanika; the second, Sangraha; then<br>Paushya; then Pauloma; the Astika; then Adivansavatarana.

The Sambhava parva<br>narrates the birth of various kings and heroes, and that of the sage,<br>Krishna Dwaipayana: the partial incarnations of deities, the generation<br>of Danavas and Yakshas of great prowess, and serpents, Gandharvas, birds,<br>and of all creatures; and lastly, of the life and adventures of king<br>Bharata&#8212;the progenitor of the line that goes by his name&#8212;the son born<br>of Sakuntala in the hermitage of the ascetic Kanwa. This parva also<br>describes the greatness of Bhagirathi, and the births of the Vasus in the<br>house of Santanu and their ascension to heaven. In this parva is also<br>narrated the birth of Bhishma uniting in himself portions of the energies<br>of the other Vasus, his renunciation of royalty and adoption of the<br>Brahmacharya mode of life, his adherence to his vows, his protection of<br>Chitrangada, and after the death of Chitrangada, his protection of his<br>younger brother, Vichitravirya, and his placing the latter on the throne:<br>the birth of Dharma among men in consequence of the curse of Animondavya;<br>the births of Dhritarashtra and Pandu through the potency of Vyasa's<br>blessings (?) and also the birth of the Pandavas; the plottings of<br>Duryodhana to send the sons of Pandu to Varanavata, and the other dark<br>counsels of the sons of Dhritarashtra in regard to the Pandavas; then the<br>advice administered to Yudhishthira on his way by that well-wisher of the<br>Pandavas&#8212;Vidura&#8212;in the mlechchha language&#8212;the digging of the hole, the<br>burning of Purochana and the sleeping woman of the fowler caste, with her<br>five sons, in the house of lac; the meeting of the Pandavas in the<br>dreadful forest with Hidimba, and the slaying of her brother Hidimba by<br>Bhima of great prowess.

In like manner hath the history of Sunda and<br>Upasunda been recited in this. This parva then treats of the departure of<br>Arjuna for the forest according to the vow, he having seen Draupadi and<br>Yudhishthira sitting together as he entered the chamber to take out arms<br>for delivering the kine of a certain Brahmana.

This<br>parva is divided by Vyasa into two hundred and twenty-seven chapters.<br>These two hundred and twenty-seven chapters contain eight thousand eight<br>hundred and eighty-four slokas.<br><br>The second is the extensive parva called Sabha or the assembly, full of<br>matter. The subjects of this parva are the establishment of the grand<br>hall by the Pandavas; their review of their retainers; the description of<br>the lokapalas by Narada well-acquainted with the celestial regions; the<br>preparations for the Rajasuya sacrifice; the destruction of Jarasandha;<br>the deliverance by Vasudeva of the princes confined in the mountain-pass;<br>the campaign of universal conquest by the Pandavas; the arrival of the<br>princes at the Rajasuya sacrifice with tribute; the destruction of<br>Sisupala on the occasion of the sacrifice, in connection with offering of<br>arghya; Bhimasena's ridicule of Duryodhana in the assembly; Duryodhana's<br>sorrow and envy at the sight of the magnificent scale on which the<br>arrangements had been made; the indignation of Duryodhana in consequence,<br>and the preparations for the game of dice; the defeat of Yudhishthira at<br>play by the wily Sakuni; the deliverance by Dhritarashtra of his<br>afflicted daughter-in-law Draupadi plunged in the sea of distress caused<br>by the gambling, as of a boat tossed about by the tempestuous waves. The<br>endeavours of Duryodhana to engage Yudhishthira again in the game; and<br>the exile of the defeated Yudhishthira with his brothers. These<br>constitute what has been called by the great Vyasa the Sabha Parva. This<br>parva is divided into seventh-eight sections, O best of Brahmanas, of two<br>thousand, five hundred and seven slokas.<br><br>Then comes the third parva called Aranyaka (relating to the forest) This<br>parva treats of the wending of the Pandavas to the forest and the<br>citizens, following the wise Yudhishthira, Yudhishthira's adoration of<br>the god of day; according to the injunctions of Dhaumya, to be gifted<br>with the power of maintaining the dependent Brahmanas with food and<br>drink: the creation of food through the grace of the Sun: the expulsion<br>by Dhritarashtra of Vidura who always spoke for his master's good;<br>Vidura's coming to the Pandavas and his return to Dhritarashtra at the<br>solicitation of the latter; the wicked Duryodhana's plottings to destroy<br>the forest-ranging Pandavas, being incited thereto by Karna; the<br>appearance of Vyasa and his dissuasion of Duryodhana bent on going to the<br>forest; the history of Surabhi; the arrival of Maitreya; his laying down<br>to Dhritarashtra the course of action; and his curse on Duryodhana;<br>Bhima's slaying of Kirmira in battle; the coming of the Panchalas and the<br>princes of the Vrishni race to Yudhishthira on hearing of his defeat at<br>the unfair gambling by Sakuni; Dhananjaya's allaying the wrath of<br>Krishna; Draupadi's lamentations before Madhava; Krishna's cheering her;<br>the fall of Sauva also has been here described by the Rishi; also<br>Krishna's bringing Subhadra with her son to Dwaraka; and Dhrishtadyumna's<br>bringing the son of Draupadi to Panchala; the entrance of the sons of<br>Pandu into the romantic Dwaita wood; conversation of Bhima, Yudhishthira,<br>and Draupadi; the coming of Vyasa to the Pandavas and his endowing<br>Yudhishthira with the power of Pratismriti; then, after the departure of<br>Vyasa, the removal of the Pandavas to the forest of Kamyaka; the<br>wanderings of Arjuna of immeasurable prowess in search of weapons; his<br>battle with Mahadeva in the guise of a hunter; his meeting with the<br>lokapalas and receipt of weapons from them; his journey to the regions of<br>Indra for arms and the consequent anxiety of Dhritarashtra; the wailings<br>and lamentations of Yudhishthira on the occasion of his meeting with the<br>worshipful great sage Brihadaswa.

Then the acquirement by Yudhishthira of the mysteries<br>of dice from the same great sage; then the arrival of the Rishi Lomasa<br>from the heavens to where the Pandavas were, and the receipt by these<br>high-souled dwellers in the woods of the intelligence brought by the<br>Rishi of their brother Arjuna staving in the heavens; then the pilgrimage<br>of the Pandavas to various sacred spots in accordance with the message of<br>Arjuna, and their attainment of great merit and virtue consequent on such<br>pilgrimage; then the pilgrimage of the great sage Narada to the shrine<br>Putasta; also the pilgrimage of the high-souled Pandavas.

The number of slokas is eleven thousand, six<br>hundred and sixty-four.<br><br>"The extensive Parva that comes next is called Virata.

These are the contents<br>of the extensive fourth Parva&#8212;the Virata. The great Rishi Vyasa has<br>composed in these sixty-seven sections. The number of slokas is two<br>thousand and fifty.<br><br>"Listen then to (the contents of) the fifth Parva which must be known as<br>Udyoga. While the Pandavas, desirous of victory, were residing in the<br>place called Upaplavya, Duryodhana and Arjuna both went at the same time<br>to Vasudeva, and said, "You should render us assistance in this war." The<br>high-souled Krishna, upon these words being uttered, replied, "O ye first<br>of men, a counsellor in myself who will not fight and one Akshauhini of<br>troops, which of these shall I give to which of you?" Blind to his own<br>interests, the foolish Duryodhana asked for the troops; while Arjuna<br>solicited Krishna as an unfighting counsellor. Then is described how,<br>when the king of Madra was coming for the assistance of the Pandavas,<br>Duryodhana, having deceived him on the way by presents and hospitality,<br>induced him to grant a boon and then solicited his assistance in battle;<br>how Salya, having passed his word to Duryodhana, went to the Pandavas and<br>consoled them by reciting the history of Indra's victory (over Vritra).<br>Then comes the despatch by the Pandavas of their Purohita (priest) to the<br>Kauravas. Then is described how king Dhritarashtra of great prowess,<br>having heard the word of the purohita of the Pandavas and the story of<br>Indra's victory decided upon sending his purohita and ultimately<br>despatched Sanjaya as envoy to the Pandavas from desire for peace. Here<br>hath been described the sleeplessness of Dhritarashtra from anxiety upon<br>hearing all about the Pandavas and their friends, Vasudeva and others. It<br>was on this occasion that Vidura addressed to the wise king Dhritarashtra<br>various counsels that were full of wisdom. It was here also that<br>Sanat-sujata recited to the anxious and sorrowing monarch the excellent<br>truths of spiritual philosophy. On the next morning Sanjaya spoke, in the<br>court of the King, of the identity of Vasudeva and Arjuna. It was then<br>that the illustrious Krishna, moved by kindness and a desire for peace,<br>went himself to the Kaurava capital, Hastinapura, for bringing about<br>peace. Then comes the rejection by prince Duryodhana of the embassy of<br>Krishna who had come to solicit peace for the benefit of both parties.<br>Here hath been recited the story of Damvodvava; then the story of the<br>high-souled Matuli's search for a husband for his daughter: then the<br>history of the great sage Galava; then the story of the training and<br>discipline of the son of Bidula. Then the exhibition by Krishna, before<br>the assembled Rajas, of his Yoga powers upon learning the evil counsels<br>of Duryodhana and Karna; then Krishna's taking Karna in his chariot and<br>his tendering to him of advice, and Karna's rejection of the same from<br>pride. Then the return of Krishna, the chastiser of enemies from<br>Hastinapura to Upaplavya, and his narration to the Pandavas of all that<br>had happened. It was then that those oppressors of foes, the Pandavas,<br>having heard all and consulted properly with each other, made every<br>preparation for war. Then comes the march from Hastinapura, for battle,<br>of foot-soldiers, horses, charioteers and elephants. Then the tale of the<br>troops by both parties. Then the despatch by prince Duryodhana of Uluka<br>as envoy to the Pandavas on the day previous to the battle. Then the tale<br>of charioteers of different classes. Then the story of Amba. These all<br>have been described in the fifth Parva called Udyoga of the Bharata,<br>abounding with incidents appertaining to war and peace. O ye ascetics,<br>the great Vyasa hath composed one hundred and eighty-six sections in this<br>Parva. The number of slokas also composed in this by the great Rishi is<br>six thousand, six hundred and ninety-eight.<br><br>"Then is recited the Bhishma Parva replete with wonderful incidents. In<br>this hath been narrated by Sanjaya the formation of the region known as<br>Jambu. Here hath been described the great depression of Yudhishthira's<br>army, and also a fierce fight for ten successive days. In this the<br>high-souled Vasudeva by reasons based on the philosophy of final release<br>drove away Arjuna's compunction springing from the latter's regard for<br>his kindred (whom he was on the eve of slaying). In this the magnanimous<br>Krishna, attentive to the welfare of Yudhishthira, seeing the loss<br>inflicted (on the Pandava army), descended swiftly from his chariot<br>himself and ran, with dauntless breast, his driving whip in hand, to<br>effect the death of Bhishma. In this, Krishna also smote with piercing<br>words Arjuna, the bearer of the Gandiva and the foremost in battle among<br>all wielders of weapons. In this, the foremost of bowmen, Arjuna, placing<br>Shikandin before him and piercing Bhishma with his sharpest arrows felled<br>him from his chariot. In this, Bhishma lay stretched on his bed of<br>arrows. This extensive Parva is known as the sixth in the Bharata. In<br>this have been composed one hundred and seventeen sections. The number of<br>slokas is five thousand, eight hundred and eighty-four as told by Vyasa<br>conversant with the Vedas.<br><br>"Then is recited the wonderful Parva called Drona full of incidents.<br>First comes the installation in the command of the army of the great<br>instructor in arms, Drona: then the vow made by that great master of<br>weapons of seizing the wise Yudhishthira in battle to please Duryodhana;<br>then the retreat of Arjuna from the field before the Sansaptakas, then<br>the overthrow of Bhagadatta like to a second Indra in the field, with the<br>elephant Supritika, by Arjuna; then the death of the hero Abhimanyu in<br>his teens, alone and unsupported, at the hands of many Maharathas<br>including Jayadratha; then after the death of Abhimanyu, the destruction<br>by Arjuna, in battle of seven Akshauhinis of troops and then of<br>Jayadratha; then the entry, by Bhima of mighty arms and by that foremost<br>of warriors-in-chariot, Satyaki, into the Kaurava ranks impenetrable even<br>to the gods, in search of Arjuna in obedience to the orders of<br>Yudhishthira, and the destruction of the remnant of the Sansaptakas. In<br>the Drona Parva, is the death of Alambusha, of Srutayus, of Jalasandha,<br>of Shomadatta, of Virata, of the great warrior-in-chariot Drupada, of<br>Ghatotkacha and others; in this Parva, Aswatthaman, excited beyond<br>measure at the fall of his father in battle, discharged the terrible<br>weapon Narayana. Then the glory of Rudra in connection with the burning<br>(of the three cities). Then the arrival of Vyasa and recital by him of<br>the glory of Krishna and Arjuna. This is the great seventh Parva of the<br>Bharata in which all the heroic chiefs and princes mentioned were sent to<br>their account. The number of sections in this is one hundred and seventy.<br>The number of slokas as composed in the Drona Parva by Rishi Vyasa, the<br>son of Parasara and the possessor of true knowledge after much<br>meditation, is eight thousand, nine hundred and nine.<br><br>"Then comes the most wonderful Parva called Karna. In this is narrated<br>the appointment of the wise king of Madra as (Karna's) charioteer. Then<br>the history of the fall of the Asura Tripura. Then the application to<br>each other by Karna and Salya of harsh words on their setting out for the<br>field, then the story of the swan and the crow recited in insulting<br>allusion: then the death of Pandya at the hands of the high-souled<br>Aswatthaman; then the death of Dandasena; then that of Darda; then<br>Yudhishthira's imminent risk in single combat with Karna in the presence<br>of all the warriors; then the mutual wrath of Yudhishthira and Arjuna;<br>then Krishna's pacification of Arjuna. In this Parva, Bhima, in<br>fulfilment of his vow, having ripped open Dussasana's breast in battle<br>drank the blood of his heart. Then Arjuna slew the great Karna in single<br>combat. Readers of the Bharata call this the eighth Parva. The number of<br>sections in this is sixty-nine and the number of slokas is four thousand,<br>nine hundred and sixty-tour.<br><br>"Then hath been recited the wonderful Parva called Salya. After all the<br>great warriors had been slain, the king of Madra became the leader of the<br>(Kaurava) army. The encounters one after another, of charioteers, have<br>been here described. Then comes the fall of the great Salya at the hands<br>of Yudhishthira, the Just. Here also is the death of Sakuni in battle at<br>the hands of Sahadeva. Upon only a small remnant of the troops remaining<br>alive after the immense slaughter, Duryodhana went to the lake and<br>creating for himself room within its waters lay stretched there for some<br>time. Then is narrated the receipt of this intelligence by Bhima from the<br>fowlers: then is narrated how, moved by the insulting speeches of the<br>intelligent Yudhishthira, Duryodhana ever unable to bear affronts, came<br>out of the waters. Then comes the encounter with clubs, between<br>Duryodhana and Bhima; then the arrival, at the time of such encounter, of<br>Balarama: then is described the sacredness of the Saraswati; then the<br>progress of the encounter with clubs; then the fracture of Duryodhana's<br>thighs in battle by Bhima with (a terrific hurl of) his mace. These all<br>have been described in the wonderful ninth Parva. In this the number of<br>sections is fifty-nine and the number of slokas composed by the great<br>Vyasa&#8212;the spreader of the fame of the Kauravas&#8212;is three thousand, two<br>hundred and twenty.<br><br>"Then shall I describe the Parva called Sauptika of frightful incidents.<br>On the Pandavas having gone away, the mighty charioteers, Kritavarman,<br>Kripa, and the son of Drona, came to the field of battle in the evening<br>and there saw king Duryodhana lying on the ground, his thighs broken, and<br>himself covered with blood. Then the great charioteer, the son of Drona,<br>of terrible wrath, vowed, 'without killing all the Panchalas including<br>Drishtadyumna, and the Pandavas also with all their allies, I will not<br>take off armour.' Having spoken those words, the three warriors leaving<br>Duryodhana's side entered the great forest just as the sun was setting.<br>While sitting under a large banian tree in the night, they saw an owl<br>killing numerous crows one after another. At the sight of this,<br>Aswatthaman, his heart full of rage at the thought of his father's fate,<br>resolved to slay the slumbering Panchalas. And wending to the gate of the<br>camp, he saw there a Rakshasa of frightful visage, his head reaching to<br>the very heavens, guarding the entrance. And seeing that Rakshasa<br>obstructing all his weapons, the son of Drona speedily pacified by<br>worship the three-eyed Rudra. And then accompanied by Kritavarman and<br>Kripa he slew all the sons of Draupadi, all the Panchalas with<br>Dhrishtadyumna and others, together with their relatives, slumbering<br>unsuspectingly in the night. All perished on that fatal night except the<br>five Pandavas and the great warrior Satyaki. Those escaped owing to<br>Krishna's counsels, then the charioteer of Dhrishtadyumna brought to the<br>Pandavas intelligence of the slaughter of the slumbering Panchalas by the<br>son of Drona. Then Draupadi distressed at the death of her sons and<br>brothers and father sat before her lords resolved to kill herself by<br>fasting. Then Bhima of terrible prowess, moved by the words of Draupadi,<br>resolved, to please her; and speedily taking up his mace followed in<br>wrath the son of his preceptor in arms. The son of Drona from fear of<br>Bhimasena and impelled by the fates and moved also by anger discharged a<br>celestial weapon saying, 'This is for the destruction of all the<br>Pandavas'; then Krishna saying. 'This shall not be', neutralised<br>Aswatthaman's speech. Then Arjuna neutralised that weapon by one of his<br>own. Seeing the wicked Aswatthaman's destructive intentions, Dwaipayana<br>and Krishna pronounced curses on him which the latter returned. Pandava<br>then deprived the mighty warrior-in-chariot Aswatthaman, of the jewel on<br>his head, and became exceedingly glad, and, boastful of their success,<br>made a present of it to the sorrowing Draupadi. Thus the tenth Parva,<br>called Sauptika, is recited. The great Vyasa hath composed this in<br>eighteen sections. The number of slokas also composed (in this) by the<br>great reciter of sacred truths is eight hundred and seventy. In this<br>Parva has been put together by the great Rishi the two Parvas called<br>Sauptika and Aishika.<br><br>"After this hath been recited the highly pathetic Parva called Stri,<br>Dhritarashtra of prophetic eye, afflicted at the death of his children,<br>and moved by enmity towards Bhima, broke into pieces a statue of hard<br>iron deftly placed before him by Krishna (as substitute of Bhima). Then<br>Vidura, removing the distressed Dhritarashtra's affection for worldly<br>things by reasons pointing to final release, consoled that wise monarch.<br>Then hath been described the wending of the distressed Dhritarashtra<br>accompanied by the ladies of his house to the field of battle of the<br>Kauravas. Here follow the pathetic wailings of the wives of the slain<br>heroes. Then the wrath of Gandhari and Dhritarashtra and their loss of<br>consciousness. Then the Kshatriya ladies saw those heroes,&#8212;their<br>unreturning sons, brothers, and fathers,&#8212;lying dead on the field. Then<br>the pacification by Krishna of the wrath of Gandhari distressed at the<br>death of her sons and grandsons. Then the cremation of the bodies of the<br>deceased Rajas with due rites by that monarch (Yudhishthira) of great<br>wisdom and the foremost also of all virtuous men. Then upon the<br>presentation of water of the manes of the deceased princes having<br>commenced, the story of Kunti's acknowledgment of Karna as her son born<br>in secret. Those have all been described by the great Rishi Vyasa in the<br>highly pathetic eleventh Parva. Its perusal moveth every feeling heart<br>with sorrow and even draweth tears from the eyes. The number of sections<br>composed is twenty-seven. The number of slokas is seven hundred and<br>seventy-five.<br><br>"Twelfth in number cometh the Santi Parva, which increaseth the<br>understanding and in which is related the despondency of Yudhishthira on<br>his having slain his fathers, brothers, sons, maternal uncles and<br>matrimonial relations. In this Parva is described how from his bed of<br>arrows Bhishma expounded various systems of duties worth the study of<br>kings desirous of knowledge; this Parva expounded the duties relative to<br>emergencies, with full indications of time and reasons. By understanding<br>these, a person attaineth to consummate knowledge. The mysteries also of<br>final emancipation have been expatiated upon. This is the twelfth Parva<br>the favourite of the wise. It consists of three hundred and thirty-nine<br>sections, and contains fourteen thousand, seven hundred and thirty-two<br>slokas.<br><br>"Next in order is the excellent Anusasana Parva. In it is described how<br>Yudhishthira, the king of the Kurus, was reconciled to himself on hearing<br>the exposition of duties by Bhishma, the son of Bhagirathi. This Parva<br>treats of rules in detail and of Dharma and Artha; then the rules of<br>charity and its merits; then the qualifications of donees, and the<br>supreme ride-regarding gifts. This Parva also describes the ceremonials<br>of individual duty, the rules of conduct and the matchless merit of<br>truth. This Parva showeth the great merit of Brahmanas and kine, and<br>unraveleth the mysteries of duties in relation to time and place. These<br>are embodied in the excellent Parva called Anusasana of varied incidents.<br>In this hath been described the ascension of Bhishma to Heaven. This is<br>the thirteenth Parva which hath laid down accurately the various duties<br>of men. The number of sections, in this is one hundred and forty-six. The<br>number of slokas is eight thousand.<br><br>"Then comes the fourteenth Parva Aswamedhika. In this is the excellent<br>story of Samvarta and Marutta. Then is described the discovery (by the<br>Pandavas) of golden treasuries; and then the birth of Parikshit who was<br>revived by Krishna after having been burnt by the (celestial) weapon of<br>Aswatthaman. The battles of Arjuna the son of Pandu, while following the<br>sacrificial horse let loose, with various princes who in wrath seized it.<br>Then is shown the great risk of Arjuna in his encounter with Vabhruvahana<br>the son of Chitrangada (by Arjuna) the appointed daughter of the chief of<br>Manipura. Then the story of the mongoose during the performance of the<br>horse-sacrifice. This is the most wonderful Parva called Aswamedhika. The<br>number of sections is one hundred and three. The number of slokas<br>composed (in this) by Vyasa of true knowledge is three thousand, three<br>hundred and twenty.<br><br>"Then comes the fifteenth Parva called Asramvasika. In this,<br>Dhritarashtra, abdicating the kingdom, and accompanied by Gandhari and<br>Vidura went to the woods. Seeing this, the virtuous Pritha also, ever<br>engaged in cherishing her superiors, leaving the court of her sons,<br>followed the old couple. In this is described the wonderful meeting<br>through the kindness of Vyasa of the king (Dhritarashtra) with the<br>spirits of his slain children, grand-children, and other princes,<br>returned from the other world. Then the monarch abandoning his sorrows<br>acquired with his wife the highest fruit of his meritorious actions. In<br>this Parva, Vidura after having leaned on virtue all his life attaineth<br>to the most meritorious state.<br><br>"The learned son of Gavalgana, Sanjaya, also of passions under full<br>control, and the foremost of ministers, attained, in the Parva, to the<br>blessed state. In this, Yudhishthira the just met Narada and heard from<br>him about the extinction of the race of Vrishnis. This is the very<br>wonderful Parva called Asramvasika. The number of sections in this is<br>forty-two, and the number of slokas composed by Vyasa cognisant of truth<br>is one thousand five hundred and six.<br><br>"After this, you know, comes the Maushala of painful incidents. In this,<br>those lion-hearted heroes (of the race of Vrishni) with the scars of many<br>a field on their bodies, oppressed with the curse of a Brahmana, while<br>deprived of reason from drink, impelled by the fates, slew each other on<br>the shores of the Salt Sea with the Eraka grass which (in their hands)<br>became (invested with the fatal attributes of the) thunder. In this, both<br>Balarama and Kesava (Krishna) after causing the extermination of their<br>race, their hour having come, themselves did not rise superior to the<br>sway of all-destroying Time. In this, Arjuna the foremost among men,<br>going to Dwaravati (Dwaraka) and seeing the city destitute of the<br>Vrishnis was much affected and became exceedingly sorry. Then after the<br>funeral of his maternal uncle Vasudeva the foremost among the Yadus<br>(Vrishnis), he saw the heroes of the Yadu race lying stretched in death<br>on the spot where they had been drinking. He then caused the cremation of<br>the bodies of the illustrious Krishna and Balarama and of the principal<br>members of the Vrishni race. Then as he was journeying from Dwaraka with<br>the women and children, the old and the decrepit&#8212;the remnants of the<br>Yadu race&#8212;he was met on the way by a heavy calamity. He witnessed also<br>the disgrace of his bow Gandiva and the unpropitiousness of his celestial<br>weapons. Seeing all this, Arjuna became despondent and, pursuant to<br>Vyasa's advice, went to Yudhishthira and solicited permission to adopt<br>the Sannyasa mode of life. This is the sixteenth Parva called Maushala<br>The number of sections is eight and the number of slokas composed by<br>Vyasa cognisant of truth is three hundred and twenty.<br><br>"The next is Mahaprasthanika, the seventeenth Parva.<br><br>"In this, those foremost among men the Pandavas abdicating their kingdom<br>went with Draupadi on their great journey called Mahaprasthana. In this,<br>they came across Agni, having arrived on the shore of the sea of red<br>waters. In this, asked by Agni himself, Arjuna worshipped him duly,<br>returned to him the excellent celestial bow called Gandiva. In this,<br>leaving his brothers who dropped one after another and Draupadi also,<br>Yudhishthira went on his journey without once looking back on them. This<br>the seventeenth Parva is called Mahaprasthanika. The number of sections<br>in this is three. The number of slokas also composed by Vyasa cognisant<br>of truth is three hundred and twenty.<br><br>"The Parva that comes after this, you must know, is the extraordinary one<br>called Svarga of celestial incidents. Then seeing the celestial car come<br>to take him, Yudhishthira moved by kindness towards the dog that<br>accompanied him, refused to ascend it without his companion. Observing<br>the illustrious Yudhishthira's steady adherence to virtue, Dharma (the<br>god of justice) abandoning his canine form showed himself to the king.<br>Then Yudhishthira ascending to heaven felt much pain. The celestial<br>messenger showed him hell by an act of deception. Then Yudhishthira, the<br>soul of justice, heard the heart-rending lamentations of his brothers<br>abiding in that region under the discipline of Yama. Then Dharma and<br>Indra showed Yudhishthira the region appointed for sinners. Then<br>Yudhishthira, after leaving the human body by a plunge in the celestial<br>Ganges, attained to that region which his acts merited, and began to live<br>in joy respected by Indra and all other gods. This is the eighteenth<br>Parva as narrated by the illustrious Vyasa. The number of slokas<br>composed, O ascetics, by the great Rishi in this is two hundred and nine.<br><br>"The above are the contents of the Eighteen Parvas. In the appendix<br>(Khita) are the Harivansa and the Vavishya. The number of slokas<br>contained in the Harivansa is twelve thousand."<br><br>These are the contents of the section called Parva-sangraha. Sauti<br>continued, "Eighteen Akshauhinis of troops came together for battle. The<br>encounter that ensued was terrible and lasted for eighteen days. He who<br>knows the four Vedas with all the Angas and Upanishads, but does not know<br>this history (Bharata), cannot be regarded as wise. Vyasa of immeasurable<br>intelligence, has spoken of the Mahabharata as a treatise on Artha, on<br>Dharma, and on Kama. Those who have listened to his history can never<br>bear to listen to others, as, indeed, they who have listened to the sweet<br>voice of the male Kokila can never hear the dissonance of the crow's<br>cawing. As the formation of the three worlds proceedeth from the five<br>elements, so do the inspirations of all poets proceed from this excellent<br>composition. O ye Brahman, as the four kinds of creatures (viviparous,<br>oviparous, born of hot moisture and vegetables) are dependent on space<br>for their existence, so the Puranas depend upon this history. As all the<br>senses depend for their exercise upon the various modifications of the<br>mind, so do all acts (ceremonials) and moral qualities depend upon this<br>treatise. There is not a story current in the world but doth depend on<br>this history, even as body upon the food it taketh. All poets cherish the<br>Bharata even as servants desirous of preferment always attend upon<br>masters of good lineage. Even as the blessed domestic Asrama can never be<br>surpassed by the three other Asramas (modes of life) so no poets can<br>surpass this poem.<br><br>"Ye ascetics, shake off all inaction. Let your hearts be fixed on virtue,<br>for virtue is the one only friend of him that has gone to the other<br>world. Even the most intelligent by cherishing wealth and wives can never<br>make these their own, nor are these possessions lasting. The Bharata<br>uttered by the lips of Dwaipayana is without a parallel; it is virtue<br>itself and sacred. It destroyeth sin and produceth good. He that<br>listeneth to it while it is being recited hath no need of a bath in the<br>sacred waters of Pushkara. A Brahmana, whatever sins he may commit during<br>the day through his senses, is freed from them all by reading the Bharata<br>in the evening. Whatever sins he may commit also in the night by deeds,<br>words, or mind, he is freed from them all by reading Bharata in the first<br>twilight (morning). He that giveth a hundred kine with horns mounted with<br>gold to a Brahmana well-posted up in the Vedas and all branches of<br>learning, and he that daily listeneth to the sacred narrations of the<br>Bharata, acquireth equal merit. As the wide ocean is easily passable by<br>men having ships, so is this extensive history of great excellence and<br>deep import with the help of this chapter called Parva sangraha."<br><br>Thus endeth the section called Parva-sangraha of the Adi Parva of the<br>blessed Mahabharata.
