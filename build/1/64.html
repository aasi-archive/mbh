                            (Adivansavatarana Parva continued)<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'O Brahmana, those thou hast named and those thou hast<br>not named, I wish to hear of them in detail, as also of other kings by<br>thousands. And, O thou of great good fortune, it behoveth thee to tell me<br>in full the object for which those Maharathas, equal unto the celestials<br>themselves, were born on earth.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'It hath been heard by us, O monarch, that what thou<br>askest is a mystery even to the gods. I shall, however, speak of it unto<br>thee, after bowing down (to the self-born). The son of Jamadagni<br>(Parasurama), after twenty-one times making the earth bereft of<br>Kshatriyas wended to that best of mountains Mahendra and there began his<br>ascetic penances. And at that time when the earth was bereft of<br>Kshatriyas, the Kshatriya ladies, desirous of offspring, used to come, O<br>monarch, to the Brahmanas and Brahmanas of rigid vows had connection with<br>them during the womanly season alone, but never, O king, lustfully and<br>out of season. And Kshatriya ladies by thousands conceived from such<br>connection with Brahmanas. Then, O monarch, were born many Kshatriyas of<br>greater energy, boys and girls, so that the Kshatriya race, might thrive.<br>And thus sprang the Kshatriya race from Kshatriya ladies by Brahmanas of<br>ascetic penances. And the new generation, blessed with long life, began<br>to thrive in virtue. And thus were the four orders having Brahmanas at<br>their head re-established. And every man at that time went in unto his<br>wife during her season and never from lust and out of season. And, O bull<br>of the Bharata race, in the same way, other creatures also, even those<br>born in the race of birds went in unto their wives during the season<br>alone. And, O protector of the earth, hundreds of thousands of creatures<br>were born, and all were virtuous and began to multiply in virtue, all<br>being free from sorrow and disease. And, O thou of the elephant's tread,<br>this wide earth having the ocean for her boundaries, with her mountains<br>and woods and towns, was once more governed by the Kshatriyas. And when<br>the earth began to be again governed virtuously by the Kshatriyas, the<br>other orders having Brahmanas for their first were filled with great joy.<br>And the kings giving up all vices born of lust and anger and justly<br>awarding punishments to those that deserved them protected the earth. And<br>he of a hundred sacrifices, possessed also of a thousand eyes, beholding<br>that the Kshatriya monarchs ruled so virtuously, poured down vivifying<br>showers at proper times and places and blessed all creatures. Then, O<br>king, no one of immature years died, and none knew a woman before<br>attaining to age. And thus, O bull of the Bharata race, the earth, to the<br>very coasts of the ocean, became filled with men that were all<br>long-lived. The Kshatriyas performed great sacrifices bestowing much<br>wealth. And the Brahmanas also all studied the Vedas with their branches<br>and the Upanishads. And, O king, no Brahmana in those days ever sold the<br>Vedas (i.e., taught for money) or ever read aloud the Vedas in the<br>presence of a Sudra. The Vaisyas, with the help of bullocks, caused the<br>earth to be tilled. And they never yoked the cattle themselves. And they<br>fed with care all cattle that were lean. And men never milked kine as<br>long as the calves drank only the milk of their dams (without having<br>taken to grass or any other food). And no merchant in those days ever<br>sold his articles by false scales. And, O tiger among men, all persons,<br>holding to the ways of virtue, did everything with eyes set upon virtue.<br>And, O monarch, all the orders were mindful of their own respective<br>duties. Thus, O tiger among men, virtue in those days never sustained any<br>diminution. And, O bull of the Bharata race, both kine and women gave<br>birth to their offspring at the proper time. And trees bore flowers and<br>fruit duly according to the seasons. And thus, O king, the krita age<br>having then duly set in, the whole earth was filled with numerous<br>creatures.<br><br>"And, O bull of the Bharata race, when such was the blessed state of the<br>terrestrial world, the Asuras, O lord of men, began to be born in kingly<br>lines. And the sons of Diti (Daityas) being repeatedly defeated in war by<br>the sons of Aditi (celestials) and deprived also of sovereignty and<br>heaven, began to be incarnated on the earth. And, O king, the Asuras<br>being possessed of great powers, and desirous of sovereignty began to be<br>born on earth amongst various creatures, such as kine, horses, asses,<br>camels, buffaloes, among creatures such as Rakshasas and others, and<br>among elephants and deer. And, O protector of the earth, owing to those<br>already born and to those that were being born, the earth became<br>incapable of supporting herself. And amongst the sons of Diti and of<br>Danu, cast out of heaven, some were born on the earth as kings of great<br>pride and insolence. Possessed of great energy, they covered the earth in<br>various shapes. Capable of oppressing all foes, they filled the earth<br>having the ocean for its boundaries. And by their strength they began to<br>oppress Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras and all other<br>creatures also. Terrifying and killing all creatures, they traversed the<br>earth, O king, in bands of hundreds and thousands. Devoid of truth and<br>virtue, proud of their strength, and intoxicated with (the wine of)<br>insolence, they even insulted the great Rishis in their hermitages.<br><br>"And the earth, thus oppressed by the mighty Asuras endued with great<br>strength and energy and possessed of abundant means, began to think of<br>waiting on Brahman. The united strength of the creatures (such as Sesha,<br>the Tortoise, and the huge Elephant), and of many Seshas too, became<br>capable of supporting the earth with her mountains, burdened as she was<br>with the weight of the Danavas. And then, O king, the earth, oppressed<br>with weight and afflicted with fear, sought the protection of the<br>Grandsire of all creatures. And she beheld the divine Brahman&#8212;the<br>Creator of the worlds who knoweth no deterioration&#8212;surrounded by the<br>gods, Brahmanas, and great Rishis, of exceeding good fortune, and adored<br>by delighted Gandharvas and Apsaras always engaged in the service of the<br>celestials. And the Earth, desirous of protection, then represented<br>everything to him, in the presence, O Bharata, of all the Regents of the<br>worlds. But, O king, the Earth's object had been known beforehand to the<br>Omniscient, Self-create, and Supreme Lord. And, O Bharata, Creator as he<br>is of the universe, why should he not know fully what is in the minds of<br>his creatures including the very gods and the Asuras? O king, the Lord of<br>the Earth, the Creator of all creatures, also called Isa, Sambhu,<br>Prajapati, then spake unto her. And Brahman said, 'O holder of wealth,<br>for the accomplishment of the object for which thou hast approached me, I<br>shall appoint all the dwellers in the heavens.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said so unto the Earth, O king, the<br>divine Brahman bade her farewell. And the Creator then commanded all the<br>gods saying, 'To ease the Earth of her burden, go ye and have your births<br>in her according to your respective parts and seek ye strife (with the<br>Asuras already born there)'. And the Creator of all, summoning also all<br>the tribes of the Gandharvas and the Apsaras, spake unto them these words<br>of deep import, 'Go ye and be born amongst men according to your<br>respective parts in forms that ye like.'<br><br>"And all the gods with Indra, on hearing these words of the Lord of the<br>celestials&#8212;words that were true, desirable under the circumstances, and<br>fraught with benefit,&#8212;accepted them. And they all having resolved to<br>come down on earth in their respected parts, then went to Narayana, the<br>slayer of all foes, at Vaikunth&#8212;the one who has the discus and the mace<br>in his hands, who is clad in purple, who is of great splendour, who hath<br>the lotus on his navel, who is the slayer of the foes of the gods, who is<br>of eyes looking down upon his wide chest (in yoga attitude), who is the<br>lord of the Prajapati himself, the sovereign of all the gods, of mighty<br>strength, who hath the mark of the auspicious whirl on his breast, who is<br>the mover of every one's faculties and who is adored by all the gods.<br>Him, Indra the most exalted of persons, addressed, saying, "Be<br>incarnate." And Hari replied,&#8212;'Let it be.'"
