And, O king, from the tribe of Asuras<br>called Krodhavasa, of whom I have already spoken to thee, were born many<br>heroic kings on earth. Madraka, and Karnaveshta, Siddhartha, and also<br>Kitaka; Suvira, and Suvahu, and Mahavira, and also Valhika, Kratha,<br>Vichitra, Suratha, and the handsome king Nila; and Chiravasa, and<br>Bhumipala; and Dantavakra, and he who was called Durjaya; that tiger<br>amongst kings named Rukmi; and king Janamejaya, Ashada, and Vayuvega, and<br>also Bhuritejas; Ekalavya, and Sumitra, Vatadhana, and also Gomukha; the<br>tribe of kings called the Karushakas, and also Khemadhurti; Srutayu, and<br>Udvaha, and also Vrihatsena; Kshema, Ugratirtha, the king of the<br>Kalingas; and Matimat, and he was known as king Iswara; these first of<br>kings were all born of the Asura class called Krodhavasa.<br><br>"There was also born on earth a mighty Asura known amongst the Danavas by<br>the name of Kalanemi, endued with great strength, of grand achievements,<br>and blessed with a large share of prosperity. He became the mighty son of<br>Ugrasena and was known on earth by the name of Kansa. And he who was<br>known among the Asuras by the name of Devaka and was besides in splendour<br>like unto Indra himself, was born on earth as the foremost king of the<br>Gandharvas. And, O monarch, know thou that Drona, the son of Bharadwaja,<br>not born of any woman, sprung from a portion of the celestial Rishi<br>Vrihaspati of grand achievements. And he was the prince of all bowmen,<br>conversant with all weapons, of mighty achievements, of great energy.<br>Thou shouldst know he was also well-acquainted with the Vedas and the<br>science of arms. And he was of wonderful deeds and the pride of his race.<br>And, O king, his son the heroic Aswatthaman, of eyes like the<br>lotus-petals, gifted with surpassing energy, and the terror of all foes,<br>the great oppressor of all enemies, was born on earth, of the united<br>portions of Mahadeva, Yama, Kama, and Krodha. And from the curse of<br>Vasishtha and the command also of Indra, the eight Vasus were born of<br>Ganga by her husband Santanu. The youngest of them was Bhishma, the<br>dispeller of the fears of the Kurus, gifted with great intelligence,<br>conversant with the Vedas, the first speakers, and the thinner of the<br>enemy's ranks. And possessed of mighty energy and the first of all<br>persons acquainted with weapons, he encountered the illustrious Rama<br>himself, the son of Jamadagni of the Bhrigu race. And, O king, that<br>Brahman sage who, on earth, was known by the name of Kripa and was the<br>embodiment of all manliness was born of the tribe of the Rudras. And the<br>mighty chariot-fighter and king who on earth was known by the name of<br>Sakuni, that crusher of foes, thou shouldst know, O king, was Dwapara<br>himself (the third yuga). And he who was Satyaki of sure aim, that<br>upholder of the pride of Vrishni race, that oppressor of foes, begotten<br>of the portion of gods called the Maruts. And that royal sage Drupada who<br>on earth was a monarch, the first among all persons bearing arms, was<br>also born of the same tribe of the celestials. And, O king, thou shouldst<br>also know that Kritavarman, that prince among men, of deeds unsurpassed<br>by any one, and the foremost of all bulls amongst Kshatriyas, was born of<br>the portion of the same celestials. And that royal sage also, Virata by<br>name, the scorcher of the kingdoms of others, and the great oppressor of<br>all foes, was born of the portion of the same gods. That son of Arishta<br>who was known by the name of Hansa, was born in the Kuru race and became<br>the monarch of the Gandharvas. He who was known as Dhritarashtra born of<br>the seed of Krishna-Dwaipayana, and gifted with long arms and great<br>energy, also a monarch, of the prophetic eye, became blind in consequence<br>of the fault of his mother and the wrath of the Rishi. His younger<br>brother who was possessed of great strength and was really a great being<br>known as Pandu, devoted to truth and virtue, was Purity's self. And, O<br>king, thou shouldst know that he who was known on earth as Vidura, who<br>was the first of all virtuous men, who was the god of Justice himself,<br>was the excellent and greatly fortunate son of the Rishi Atri. The<br>evil-minded and wicked king Duryodhana, the destroyer of the fair fame of<br>the Kurus, was born of a portion of Kali on earth. He it was who caused<br>all creatures to be slain and the earth to be wasted; and he it was who<br>fanned the flame of hostility that ultimately consumed all. They who had<br>been the sons of Pulastya (the Rakshasas) were born on earth among men of<br>Duryodhana's brothers, that century of wicked individuals commencing with<br>Duhasasana as their first. And, O bull among the Bharata princes,<br>Durmukha, Duhsaha, and others whose names I do not mention, who always<br>supported Duryodhana (in all his schemes), were, indeed, the sons of<br>Pulastya. And over and above these hundred, Dhritarashtra had one son<br>named Yuyutsu born of a Vaisya wife.'<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'O illustrious one, tell me the names of<br>Dhritarashtra's sons according to the order of their birth beginning from<br>the eldest.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'O king, they are as follows: Duryodhana, and<br>Yuyutsu, and also Duhsasana; Duhsaha and Duhshala, and then Durmukha;<br>Vivinsati, and Vikarna, Jalasandha, Sulochna, Vinda and Anuvinda,<br>Durdharsha, Suvahu, Dushpradharshana; Durmarshana, and Dushkarna, and<br>Karna; Chitra and Vipachitra, Chitraksha, Charuchitra, and Angada,<br>Durmada, and Dushpradharsha, Vivitsu, Vikata, Sama; Urananabha, and<br>Padmanabha, Nanda and Upanandaka; Sanapati, Sushena, Kundodara; Mahodara;<br>Chitravahu, and Chitravarman, Suvarman, Durvirochana; Ayovahu, Mahavahu,<br>Chitrachapa and Sukundala, Bhimavega, Bhimavala, Valaki, Bhimavikrama,<br>Ugrayudha, Bhimaeara, Kanakayu, Dridhayudha, Dridhavarman, Dridhakshatra<br>Somakirti, Anadara; Jarasandha, Dridhasandha, Satyasandha, Sahasravaeh;<br>Ugrasravas, Ugrasena, and Kshemamurti; Aprajita, Panditaka, Visalaksha,<br>Duradhara, Dridhahasta, and Suhasta, Vatavega, and Suvarchasa;<br>Adityaketu, Vahvasin, Nagadatta and Anuyaina; Nishangi, Kuvachi, Dandi,<br>Dandadhara, Dhanugraha; Ugra, Bhimaratha, Vira, Viravahu, Alolupa;<br>Abhaya, and Raudrakarman, also he who was Dridharatha; Anadhrishya,<br>Kundaveda, Viravi, Dhirghalochana; Dirghavahu; Mahavahu; Vyudhoru,<br>Kanakangana; Kundaja and Chitraka. There was also a daughter named<br>Duhsala who was over and above the hundred. And Yuyutsu who was<br>Dhritarashtra's son by a Vaisya wife, was also over and above the<br>hundred. Thus, O king, have I recited the names of the hundred sons and<br>also that of the daughter (of Dhritarashtra). Thou hast now known their<br>names according to the order of their births. All of them were heroes and<br>great car-warriors, and skilled in the art of warfare. Besides, all of<br>them were versed in the Vedas, and, O king, all of them had got through<br>the scriptures. All of them were mighty in attack and defence, and all<br>were graced with learning. And, O monarch, all of them had wives suitable<br>to them in grace and accomplishments. And, O king, when the time came,<br>the Kaurava monarch bestowed his daughter Duhsala on Jayadratha, the king<br>of the Sindhus, agreeably to the counsels of Sakuni.<br><br>"And, O monarch, learn that king Yudhishthira was a portion of Dharma;<br>that Bhimasena was of the deity of wind; that Arjuna was of Indra, the<br>chief of the celestials; and that Nakula and Sahadeva, the handsomest<br>beings among all creatures, and unrivalled for beauty on earth, were<br>similarly portions of the twin Aswins. And he who was known as the mighty<br>Varchas, the son of Soma, became Abhimanyu of wonderful deeds, the son of<br>Arjuna. And before his incarnation, O king, the god Soma had said these<br>words to the celestials, 'I cannot give (part with) my son. He is dearer<br>to me than life itself. Let this be the compact and let it be not<br>transgressed. The destruction of the Asuras on earth is the work of the<br>celestials, and, therefore, it is our work as well. Let this Varchas,<br>therefore, go thither, but let him not stay there long. Nara, whose<br>companion is Narayana, will be born as Indra's son and indeed, will be<br>known as Arjuna, the mighty son of Pandu. This boy of mine shall be his<br>son and become a mighty car-warrior in his boyhood. And let him, ye best<br>of immortals, stay on earth for sixteen years. And when he attaineth to<br>his sixteenth year, the battle shall take place in which all who are born<br>of your portions shall achieve the destruction of mighty warriors. But a<br>certain encounter shall take place without both Nara and Narayana (taking<br>any part in it). And, indeed, your portions, ye celestials, shall fight,<br>having made that disposition of the forces which is known by the name of<br>the Chakra-vyuha. And my son shall compel all foes to retreat before him.<br>The boy of mighty arms having penetrated the impenetrable array, shall<br>range within it fearlessly and send a fourth part of the hostile force,<br>in course of half a day, unto the regions of the king of the dead. Then<br>when numberless heroes and mighty car-warriors will return to the charge<br>towards the close of the day, my boy of mighty arms, shall reappear<br>before me. And he shall beget one heroic son in his line, who shall<br>continue the almost extinct Bharata race.' Hearing these words of Soma,<br>the dwellers in heaven replied, 'So be it.' And then all together<br>applauded and worshipped (Soma) the king of stars. Thus, O king, have I<br>recited to thee the (particulars of the) birth of thy father's father.<br><br>"Know also, O monarch, that the mighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna was a<br>portion of Agni. And know also that Sikhandin, who was at first a female,<br>was (the incarnation of) a Rakshasa. And, O bull in Bharata's race, they<br>who became the five sons of Draupadi, those bulls amongst the Bharata<br>princes, were the celestials known as the Viswas. Their names were<br>Pritivindhya, Sutasoma, Srutakirti, Satanika, Nakula, and Srutasena,<br>endued with mighty energy.<br><br>"Sura, the foremost of the Yadus, was the father of Vasudeva. He had a<br>daughter called Pritha, who for her beauty, was unrivalled on earth. And<br>Sura, having promised in the presence of fire that he would give his<br>firstborn child to Kuntibhoja, the son of his paternal aunt, who was<br>without offspring, gave his daughter unto the monarch in expectation of<br>his favours. Kuntibhoja thereupon made her his daughter. And she became,<br>thenceforth, in the house of her (adoptive) father, engaged in attending<br>upon Brahmanas and guests. One day she had to wait upon the wrathful<br>ascetic of rigid vows, Durvasa by name, acquainted with truth and fully<br>conversant with the mysteries of religion. And Pritha with all possible<br>care gratified the wrathful Rishi with soul under complete control. The<br>holy one, gratified with the attentions bestowed on him by the maiden,<br>told her, 'I am satisfied, O fortunate one, with thee! By this mantra<br>(that I am about to give thee), thou shall be able to summon (to thy<br>side) whatever celestials thou likest. And, by their grace, shall thou<br>also obtain children.' Thus addressed, the girl (a little while after),<br>seized with curiosity, summoned, during the period of her maiden-hood,<br>the god Surya. And the lord of light thereupon made her conceive and<br>begot on her a son who became the first of all wielders of weapons. From<br>fear of relatives she brought forth in secrecy that child who had come<br>out with ear-rings and coat of mail. And he was gifted with the beauty of<br>a celestial infant, and in splendour was like unto the maker of day<br>himself. And every part of his body was symmetrical and well-adorned. And<br>Kunti cast the handsome child into the water. But the child thus thrown<br>into the water was taken up by the excellent husband of Radha and given<br>by him to his wife to be adopted by her as their son. And the couple gave<br>him the name of Vasusena, by which appellation the child soon became<br>known all over the land. And, as he grew up, he became very strong and<br>excelled in all weapons. The first of all successful persons, he soon<br>mastered the sciences. And when the intelligent one having truth for his<br>strength recited the Vedas, there was nothing he would not then give to<br>the Brahmanas. At that time Indra, the originator of all things, moved by<br>the desire of benefiting his own son Arjuna, assumed the guise of a<br>Brahmana, came to him, and begged of the hero his ear-rings and natural<br>armour. And the hero taking off his ear-rings and armour gave them unto<br>the Brahmana. And Sakra (accepting the gift) presented to the giver a<br>dart, surprised (at his open handedness), and addressed him in these<br>words, 'O invincible one, amongst the celestials, Asuras, men,<br>Gandharvas, Nagas, and Rakshasas, he at whom thou hurlest (this weapon),<br>that one shall certainly be slain.' And the son of Surya was at first<br>known in the world by the name of Vasusena. But, for his deeds, he<br>subsequently came to be called Karna. And because that hero of great fame<br>had taken off his natural armour, therefore was he&#8212;the first son of<br>Pritha&#8212;called Kama. And, O best of kings, the hero began to grow up in<br>the Suta caste. And, O king, know thou that Kama&#8212;the first of all<br>exalted men&#8212;the foremost of all wielders of weapons&#8212;the slayer of<br>foes&#8212;and the best portion of the maker of day&#8212;was the friend and<br>counsellor of Duryodhana. And he, called Vasudeva, endued with great<br>valour, was among men a portion of him called Narayana&#8212;the god of<br>gods&#8212;eternal. And Valadeva of exceeding strength was a portion of the<br>Naga, Sesha. And, O monarch, know that Pradyumna of great energy was<br>Sanatkumara. And in this way the portion of various other dwellers in<br>heaven became exalted men in the race of Vasudeva, increasing the glory<br>thereof. And, O king, the portions of the tribe of Apsaras which I have<br>mentioned already, also became incarnate on earth according to Indra's<br>commands&#8212;And sixteen thousand portions of those goddesses became, O<br>king, in this world of men, the wives of Vasudeva. And a portion of Sri<br>herself became incarnate on earth, for the gratification of Narayana, in<br>the line of Bhishmaka. And she was by name the chaste Rukmini. And the<br>faultless Draupadi, slender-waisted like the wasp, was born of a portion<br>of Sachi (the queen of the celestials), in the line of Drupada. And she<br>was neither low nor tall in stature. And she was of the fragrance of the<br>blue lotus, of eyes large as lotus-petals, of thighs fair and round, of<br>dense masses of black curly hair. And endued with every auspicious<br>feature and of complexion like that of the emerald, she became the<br>charmer of the hearts of five foremost of men. And the two goddesses<br>Siddhi and Dhriti became the mothers of those five, and were called Kunti<br>and Madri. And she who was Mati became the daughter (Gandhari) of Suvala.<br><br>"Thus, O king, have I recited to thee all about the incarnation,<br>according to their respective portions, of the gods, the Asuras, the<br>Gandharvas, the Apsaras, and of the Rakshasas. They who were born on<br>earth as monarchs invincible in battle, those high-souled ones who were<br>born in the wide extended line of the Yadus, they who were born as mighty<br>monarchs in other lines, they who were born as Brahmanas and Kshatriyas<br>and Vaisyas, have all been recited by me duly. And this account of the<br>incarnation (of superior beings according to their respective portions)<br>capable of bestowing wealth, fame, offspring, long life, and success,<br>should always be listened to in a proper frame of mind. And having<br>listened to this account of incarnation, according to their portions, of<br>gods, Gandharvas, and Rakshasas, the hearer becoming acquainted with the<br>creation, preservation, and destruction of the universe and acquiring<br>wisdom, is never cast down even under the most engrossing sorrows.'"
