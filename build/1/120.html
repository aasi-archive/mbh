                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Pandu, possessed of great energy, then devoted<br>himself to asceticism. Within a short time he became the favourite of the<br>whole body of the Siddhas and Charanas residing there. And, O Bharata,<br>devoted to the service of his spiritual masters, free from vanity, with<br>mind under complete control and the passions fully subdued, the prince,<br>becoming competent to enter heaven by his own energy, attained to great<br>(ascetic) prowess. Some of the Rishis would call him brother, some<br>friend, while others cherished him as their son. And, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, having acquired after a long time great ascetic merit coupled with<br>complete singleness, Pandu became even like a Brahmarshi (though he was a<br>Kshatriya by birth).<br><br>"On a certain day of the new moon, the great Rishis of rigid vows<br>assembled together, and desirous of beholding Brahman were on the point<br>of starting on their expedition. Seeing them about to start, Pandu asked<br>those ascetics, saying, 'Ye first of eloquent men, where shall we go?'<br>The Rishis answered, 'There will be a great gathering today, in the abode<br>of Brahman, of celestials, Rishis and Pitris. Desirous of beholding the<br>Self-create we shall go there today.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing this, Pandu rose up suddenly, desirous<br>of visiting heaven along with the great Rishis. Accompanied by his two<br>wives, when he was on the point of following the Rishis in the northerly<br>direction from the mountain of hundred peaks, those ascetics addressed<br>him saying, 'In our northward march, while gradually ascending the king<br>of mountains, we have seen on its delightful breast many regions<br>inaccessible to ordinary mortals; retreats also of the gods, and<br>Gandharvas and Apsaras, with palatial mansions by hundreds clustering<br>thick around and resounding with the sweet notes of celestial music, the<br>gardens of Kuvera laid out on even and uneven grounds, banks of mighty<br>rivers, and deep caverns. There are many regions also on those heights<br>that are covered with perpetual snow and are utterly destitute of<br>vegetable and animal existence. In some places the downpour of rain is so<br>heavy that they are perfectly inaccessible and incapable of being<br>utilised for habitation. Not to speak of other animals, even winged<br>creatures cannot cross them. The only thing that can go there is air, and<br>the only beings, Siddhas and great Rishis. How shall these princesses<br>ascend those heights of the king of mountains? Unaccustomed to pain,<br>shall they not droop in affliction? Therefore, come not with us, O bull<br>of Bharata's race!'<br><br>"Pandu replied, 'Ye fortunate ones, it is said that for the sonless there<br>is no admittance into heaven. I am sonless! I In affliction I speak' unto<br>you! I am afflicted because I have not been able to discharge the debt I<br>owe to my ancestors. It is certain that with the dissolution of this my<br>body my ancestors perish! Men are born on this earth with four debts,<br>viz. those due unto the (deceased) ancestors, the gods, the Rishis, and<br>other men. In justice these must be discharged. The wise have declared<br>that no regions of bliss exist for them that neglect to pay these debts<br>in due time. The gods are paid (gratified) by sacrifices, the Rishis, by<br>study, meditation, and asceticism, the (deceased) ancestors, by begetting<br>children and offering the funeral cake, and, lastly other men, by leading<br>a humane and inoffensive life. I have justly discharged my obligations to<br>the Rishis, the gods, and other men. But those others than these three<br>are sure to perish with the dissolution of my body! Ye ascetics, I am not<br>yet freed from the debt I owe to my (deceased) ancestors. The best of men<br>are born in this world to beget children for discharging that debt. I<br>would ask you, should children be begotten in my soil (upon my wives) as<br>I myself was begotten in the soil of my father by the eminent Rishi?'<br><br>"The Rishis said, 'O king of virtuous soul, there is progeny in store for<br>thee, that is sinless and blest with good fortune and like unto the gods.<br>We behold it all with our prophetic eyes. Therefore, O tiger among men,<br>accomplish by your own acts that which destiny pointeth at. Men of<br>intelligence, acting with deliberation, always obtain good fruits; it<br>behoveth thee, therefore, O king, to exert thyself. The fruits thou<br>wouldst obtain are distinctly visible. Thou wouldst really obtain<br>accomplished and agreeable progeny.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of the ascetics, Pandu,<br>remembering the loss of his procreative powers owing to the curse of the<br>deer, began to reflect deeply. And calling his wedded wife the excellent<br>Kunti, unto him, he told her in private, 'Strive thou to raise offspring<br>at this time of distress. The wise expounders of the eternal religion<br>declare that a son, O Kunti, is the cause of virtuous fame in the three<br>worlds. It is said that sacrifices, charitable gifts, ascetic penances,<br>and vows observed most carefully, do not confer religious merit on a<br>sonless man. O thou of sweet smiles, knowing all this, I am certain that<br>as I am sonless, I shall not obtain regions of true felicity. O timid<br>one, wretch that I was and addicted to cruel deeds, as a consequence of<br>the polluted life I led, my power of procreation hath been destroyed by<br>the curse of the deer. The religious institutes mention six kinds of sons<br>that are heirs and kinsmen, and six other kinds that are not heirs but<br>kinsmen. I shall speak of them presently. O Pritha, listen to me. They<br>are: 1st, the son begotten by one's own self upon his wedded wife; 2nd,<br>the son begotten upon one's wife by an accomplished person from motives<br>of kindness; 3rd, the son begotten upon one's wife by a person for<br>pecuniary consideration; 4th, the son begotten upon the wife after the<br>husband's death; 5th, the maiden-born son; 6th, the son born of an<br>unchaste wife; 7th, the son given; 8th, the son bought for a<br>consideration; 9th, the son self-given; 10th, the son received with a<br>pregnant bride; 11th, the brother's son; and 12th, the son begotten upon<br>a wife of lower caste. On failure of offspring of a prior class, the<br>mother should desire to have offspring of the next class. In times of<br>distress, men solicit offspring from accomplished younger brothers. The<br>self-born Manu hath said that men failing to have legitimate offspring of<br>their own may have offspring begotten upon their wives by others, for<br>sons confer the highest religious merit. Therefore, O Kunti, being<br>destitute myself of the power of procreation, I command thee to raise<br>good offspring through some person who is either equal or superior to me.<br>O Kunti, listen to the history of the daughter of Saradandayana who was<br>appointed by her lord to raise offspring. That warrior-dame, when her<br>monthly season arrived, bathed duly and in the night went out and waited<br>on a spot where four roads met. She did not wait long when a Brahmana<br>crowned with ascetic success came there. The daughter of Saradandayana<br>solicited him for offspring. After pouring libations of clarified butter<br>on the fire (in the performance of the sacrifice known by the name of<br>Punsavana) she brought forth three sons that were mighty car-warriors and<br>of whom Durjaya was the eldest, begotten upon her by that Brahmana. O<br>thou of good fortune, do thou follow that warrior-dame's example at my<br>command, and speedily raise offspring out of the seed of some Brahmana of<br>high ascetic merit.'"
