                            (Arjuna-vanavasa Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Varga continued, 'We were then, O foremost one of<br>Bharata's race, deeply distressed at this curse. We sought to propitiate<br>that Brahmana of ascetic wealth that departed not from his vow.<br>Addressing him, we said, 'Inflated with a sense of our beauty and youth,<br>and urged by the god of desire, we have acted very improperly. It<br>behoveth thee, O Brahmana, to pardon us! Truly, O Brahmana, it was death<br>to us that we had at all come hither to tempt thee of rigid vows and<br>ascetic wealth. The virtuous, however, have said that women should never<br>be slain. Therefore grow thou in virtue. It behoveth thee not to slay us<br>so. O thou that art conversant with virtue, it hath been said that a<br>Brahmana is ever the friend of every creature. O thou of great<br>prosperity, let this speech of the wise become true. The eminent always<br>protect those that seek protection at their hands. We seek thy<br>protection. It behoveth thee to grant us pardon.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, that Brahmana of virtuous soul<br>and good deeds and equal in splendour, O hero, unto the sun or the moon,<br>became propitious unto them. And the Brahmana said, 'The words hundred<br>and hundred thousand are all indicative of eternity. The word hundred,<br>however, as employed by me is to be understood as a limited period and<br>not indicative of a period without end. Ye shall, therefore, becoming<br>crocodiles, seize and take away men (for only a hundred years as<br>explained by me). At the end of that period, an exalted individual will<br>drag you all from water to the land. Then ye will resume your real forms.<br>Never have I spoken an untruth even in jest. Therefore, all that I have<br>said must come to pass. And those sacred waters (within which I assign<br>you your places), will, after you will have been delivered by that<br>individual, become known all over the world by the name of Nari-tirthas<br>(or sacred waters connected with the sufferings and the deliverance of<br>females), and all of them shall become sacred and sin cleansing in the<br>eyes of the virtuous and the wise.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Varga then addressing Arjuna, finished her<br>discourse, saying, 'Hearing these words of the Brahmana, we saluted him<br>with reverence and walked round him. Leaving that region we came away<br>with heavy hearts, thinking as we proceeded, 'Where shall we all soon<br>meet with that man who will give us back our own shapes (after our<br>transformation)?' As we were thinking of it, in almost a moment, O<br>Bharata, we beheld even the eminent celestial Rishi Narada. Beholding<br>that Rishi of immeasurable energy, our hearts were filled with joy.<br>Saluting him with reverence, O Partha, we stood before him, with blushing<br>faces. He asked of us the cause of our sorrow and we told him all.<br>Hearing what had happened the Rishi said, 'In the low-lands bordering on<br>the southern ocean, there are five regions of sacred water. They are<br>delightful and eminently holy. Go ye thither without delay. That tiger<br>among men, Dhananjaya, the son of Pandu of pure soul, will soon deliver<br>you, without doubt, from this sad plight.' O hero, hearing the Rishi's<br>words, all of us came hither. O sinless one, true it is that I have today<br>been delivered by thee. But those four friends of mine are still within<br>the other waters here. O hero, do a good deed by delivering them also.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then, O monarch, that foremost of the Pandavas,<br>endued with great prowess, cheerfully delivered all of them from that<br>curse. Rising from the waters they all regained their own forms. Those<br>Apsaras then, O king, all looked as before. Freeing those sacred waters<br>(from the danger for which they had been notorious), and giving the<br>Apsaras leave to go where they chose, Arjuna became desirous of once more<br>beholding Chitrangada. He, therefore, proceeded towards the city of<br>Manipura. Arrived there, he beheld on the throne the son he had begotten<br>upon Chitrangada, and who was called by the name of Vabhruvahana. Seeing<br>Chitrangada once more, Arjuna proceeded, O monarch, towards the spot<br>called Gokarna.'"
