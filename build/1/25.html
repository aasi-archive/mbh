                            (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Then that bird of great strength and energy and capable of<br>going at will to every place repaired to his mother's side on the other<br>shore of the great ocean. Thither lived Vinata in affliction, defeated in<br>wager and put into a state of slavery. Once Kadru calling Vinata who had<br>prostrated herself before the former, addressed her these words in the<br>presence of her son, 'O gentle Vinata, there is in the midst of the<br>ocean, in a remote quarter, a delightful and fair region inhabited by the<br>Nagas. Bear me thither!' At this that mother of the bird of fair feathers<br>bore (on her shoulders) the mother of the snakes. And Garuda also,<br>directed by his mother's words, carried (on his back) the snakes. And<br>that ranger of the skies born of Vinata began to ascend towards the Sun.<br>And thereupon the snakes, scorched by the rays of the Sun, swooned away.<br>And Kadru seeing her sons in that state prayed to Indra, saying, 'I bow<br>to thee, thou Lord of all the gods! I bow to thee, thou slayer of Vritra!<br>I bow to thee, thou slayer of Namuchi! O thou of a thousand eyes, consort<br>of Sachi! By thy showers, be thou the protector of the snakes scorched by<br>the Sun. O thou best of the deities, thou art our great protector. O<br>Purandara, thou art able to grant rain in torrents. Thou art Vayu (the<br>air), the clouds, fire, and the lightning of the skies. Thou art the<br>propeller of the clouds, and hast been called the great cloud (i.e., that<br>which will darken the universe at the end of Yuga). Thou art the fierce<br>and incomparable thunder, and the roaring clouds. Thou art the Creator of<br>the worlds and their Destroyer. Thou art unconquered. Thou art the light<br>of all creatures, Aditya, Vibhavasu, and the wonderful elements. Thou art<br>the ruler of all the gods. Thou art Vishnu. Thou hast a thousand eyes.<br>Thou art a god, and the final resource. Thou art, O deity, all amrita,<br>and the most adored Soma. Thou art the moment, the lunar day, the bala<br>(minute), thou art the kshana (4 minutes). Thou art the lighted<br>fortnight, and also the dark fortnight. Thou art kala, thou kashtha, and<br>thou Truti.[1] Thou art the year, the seasons, the months, the nights,<br>and the days. Thou art the fair Earth with her mountains and forests.<br>Thou art also the firmament, resplendent with the Sun. Thou art the great<br>Ocean with heaving billows and abounding with whales, swallowers of<br>whales, and makaras, and various fishes. Thou art of great renown, always<br>adored by the wise and by the great Rishis with minds rapt in<br>contemplation. Thou drinkest, for the good of all creatures, the Soma<br>juice in sacrifices and the clarified butter offered with sacred<br>invocation. Thou art always worshipped at sacrifices by Brahmanas moved<br>by desire of fruit. O thou of incomparable mass of strength, thou art<br>sung in the Vedas and Vedangas. It is for that reason that learned<br>Brahmanas bent upon performing sacrifices, study the Vedas with every<br>care.'"<br><br>And so ends the twenty-fifth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.
