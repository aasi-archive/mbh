                            (Chaitraratha Parva continued)<br><br>"The Brahmana continued, 'King Drupada (after this), distressed at heart,<br>wandered among many asylums of Brahmanas in search of superior Brahmanas<br>well-skilled in sacrificial rites. Overwhelmed with grief and eagerly<br>yearning for children, the king always said, 'Oh, I have no offspring<br>surpassing all in accomplishments.' And the monarch, from great<br>despondency, always said 'Oh, fie on those children that I have and on my<br>relatives!' And ever thinking of revenging himself on Drona, the monarch<br>sighed incessantly. And that best of kings, O Bharata, even after much<br>deliberation, saw no way of overcoming, by his Kshatriya might, the<br>prowess and discipline and training and accomplishment of Drona.<br>Wandering along the banks of the Yamuna and the Ganga, the monarch once<br>came upon a sacred asylum of Brahmanas. There was in that asylum no<br>Brahmana who was not a Snataka, no one who was not of rigid vows, and<br>none who was not virtuous to a high degree. And the king saw there two<br>Brahmana sages named Yaja and Upayaja, both of rigid vows and souls under<br>complete control and belonging to the most superior order. They were both<br>devoted to the study of the ancient institutes and sprung from the race<br>of Kasyapa. And those best of Brahmanas were well-able to help the king<br>in the attainment of his object. The king then, with great assiduity and<br>singleness of purpose, began to court this pair of excellent Brahmanas.<br>Ascertaining the superior accomplishments of the younger of the two the<br>king courted in private Upayaja of rigid vows, by the offer of every<br>desirable acquisition. Employed in paying homage to the feet of Upayaja,<br>always addressing in sweet words and offering him every object of human<br>desire, Drupada, after worshipping that Brahmana, addressed him (one<br>day), saying, 'O Upayaja, O Brahmana, if thou, performest those<br>sacrificial rites by (virtue of) which I may obtain a son who may slay<br>Drona, I promise thee ten thousand kine, or whatever else may be<br>agreeable to thee, O first of Brahmanas, truly am I ready to make gifts<br>to thee.' Thus addressed by the king, the Rishi replied, saying, 'I<br>cannot (perform such rites).' But Drupada without accepting this reply as<br>final, once more began to serve and pay homage unto that Brahmana. Then,<br>after the expiration of a year, Upayaja, that first of Brahmanas, O<br>monarch, addressing Drupada in sweet tone, said, 'My elder brother<br>(Yaja), one day, while wandering through the deep woods, took up a fruit<br>that had fallen upon a spot the purity of which he cared not to enquire<br>about. I was following him (at the time) and observed this unworthy act<br>of his. Indeed, he entertains no scruples in accepting things impure. In<br>accepting that (particular) fruit he saw not any impropriety of sinful<br>nature: Indeed, he who observeth not purity (in one instance) is not very<br>likely to observe it in the other instances. When he lived in the house<br>of his preceptor, employed in studying the institutes, he always used to<br>eat (impure) remnants of other people's feasts. He always speaks<br>approvingly of food and entertains no dislike for anything. Arguing from<br>these, I believe that my brother covets earthy acquisitions. Therefore, O<br>king, go unto him; he will perform spiritual offices for thee.' Hearing<br>these words of Upayaja, king Drupada, though entertaining a low opinion<br>of Yaja, nevertheless went to his abode. Worshipping Yaja who was (still)<br>worthy of homage, Drupada said unto him, 'O master, perform thou<br>spiritual offices for me and I will give thee eighty thousand kine!<br>Enmity with Drona burneth my heart; it behoveth thee therefore to cool<br>that heart of mine. Foremost of those conversant with the Vedas, Drona is<br>also skilled in the Brahma weapon and for this, Drona hath overcome me in<br>a contest arising from (impaired) friendship. Gifted with great<br>intelligence, the son of Bharadwaja is (now) the chief preceptor of the<br>Kurus. There is no Kshatriya in this world superior to him. His bow is<br>full six cubits long and looks formidable, and his shafts are capable of<br>slaying every living being. That great bowman, the high-souled son of<br>Bharadwaja, habited as a Brahmana, is destroying the Kshatriya power all<br>over the earth. Indeed, he is like a second Jamadagnya intended for the<br>extermination of the Kshatriya race. There is no man on earth who can<br>overcome the terrible force of his weapons. Like a blazing fire fed with<br>clarified butter, Drona, possessed of Brahma might and uniting it with<br>Kshatriya might, consumeth every antagonist in battle. But (thy) Brahma<br>force is greater in itself than (Drona's) Brahma force united with<br>Kshatriya might. Therefore, as I am inferior (to Drona) in consequence of<br>my possession of Kshatriya might alone, I solicit the aid of thy Brahma<br>force, having obtained thee so superior to Drona in knowledge of Brahma.<br>O Yaja, perform that sacrifice by means of which I may obtain a son<br>invincible in battle and capable of slaying Drona. Ready am I to give<br>thee ten thousand kine.' Hearing these words of Drupada, Yaja said, 'So<br>be it.' Yaja then began to recollect the various ceremonies appertaining<br>to the particular sacrifice. And knowing the affair to be a very grave<br>one, he asked the assistance of Upayaja who coveted nothing. Then Yaja<br>promised to perform the sacrifice for the destruction of Drona. Then the<br>great ascetic Upayaja spoke unto king Drupada of everything required for<br>the grand sacrifice (by aid of fire) from which the king was to obtain<br>offspring. And he said, 'O king, a child shall be born unto thee, endued,<br>as thou desirest, with great prowess, great energy, and great strength.'<br><br>"The Brahmana continued, 'Then king Drupada, impelled by the desire of<br>obtaining a son who was to slay Drona, began, for the success of his<br>wish, to make the necessary preparations. (And when everything was<br>complete) Yaja, after having poured libations of clarified butter on the<br>sacrificial fire, commanded Drupada's queen, saying, 'Come hither, O<br>queen, O daughter-in-law of Prishata! A son and a daughter have arrived<br>for thee!' Hearing this, the queen said, 'O Brahmana, my mouth is yet<br>filled with saffron and other perfumed things. My body also beareth many<br>sweet scents; I am hardly fit for accepting (the sanctified butter which<br>is to give me offspring). Wait for me a little, O Yaja! Wait for that<br>happy consummation.' Yaja, however, replied, 'O lady, whether thou comest<br>or waitest, why should not the object of this sacrifice be accomplished<br>when the oblation hath already been prepared by me and sanctified by<br>Upayaja's invocations?'<br><br>"The Brahmana continued, 'Having said this, Yaja poured the sanctified<br>libation on the fire, whereupon arose from those flames a child<br>resembling a celestial who possessing the effulgence of fire, was<br>terrible to behold. With a crown on this head and his body encased in<br>excellent armour, sword in hand, and bearing a bow and arrows, he<br>frequently sent forth loud roars. And immediately after his birth, he<br>ascended an excellent chariot and went about in it for some time. Then<br>the Panchalas in great joy shouted, 'Excellent, Excellent.' The very<br>earth seemed at that time unable to bear the weight of the Panchalas mad<br>with joy. Then, marvellous to say, the voice of some invisible spirit in<br>the skies said, 'This prince hath been born for the destruction of Drona.<br>He shall dispel all the fears of the Panchalas and spread their fame. He<br>shall also remove the sorrow of the king.' And there arose, after this<br>from the centre of the sacrificial platform, a daughter also, called<br>Panchali, who, blest with great good fortune, was exceedingly handsome.<br>Her eyes were black, and large as lotus-petals, her complexion was dark,<br>and her locks were blue and curly. Her nails were beautifully convex, and<br>bright as burnished copper; her eye-brows were fair, and bosom was deep.<br>Indeed, she resembled the veritable daughter of a celestial born among<br>men. Her body gave out fragrance like that of a blue lotus, perceivable<br>from a distance of full two miles. Her beauty was such that she had no<br>equal on earth. Like a celestial herself, she could be desired (in<br>marriage) by a celestial, a Danava, or a: Yaksha. When this girl of fair<br>hips was born an incorporeal voice said, 'This dark-complexioned girl<br>will be the first of all women, and she will be the cause of the<br>destruction of many Kshatriyas. This slender-waisted one will, in time,<br>accomplish the purpose of the gods, and along with her many a danger will<br>overtake the Kauravas.' On hearing these words, the Panchalas uttered a<br>loud leonine roar, and the earth was unable to bear the weight of that<br>joyous concourse. Then beholding the boy and the girl, the<br>daughter-in-law of Prishata, desiring to have them, approached Yaja and<br>said, 'Let not these know any one else except myself as their mother.'<br>Yaja, desiring to do good unto the king said, 'So be it!' Then the<br>Brahmanas (present there), their expectations fully gratified, bestowed<br>names upon the new-born pair, 'Let this son of king Drupada, they said,<br>be called Dhrishtadyumna, because of his excessive audacity and because<br>of his being born like Dyumna with a natural mail and weapon.' And they<br>also said, 'Because this daughter is so dark in complexion, she should be<br>called Krishna (the dark).'<br><br>"The Brahmana continued, 'Thus were born those twins of the great<br>sacrifice of Drupada. And the great Drona, bringing the Panchala prince<br>into his own abode, taught him all weapons in requital of half the<br>kingdom he had formerly taken from Drupada. The high-souled son of<br>Bharadwaja, regarding destiny to be inevitable, did what would perpetuate<br>his own great deeds.'"
