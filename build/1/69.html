                            (Sambhava Parva continued)<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'I desire to hear from thee about the birth and life of<br>the high-souled Bharata and of the origin of Sakuntala. And, O holy one,<br>I also desire to hear all about Dushmanta&#8212;that lion among men&#8212;and how<br>the hero obtained Sakuntala. It behoveth thee, O knower of truth and the<br>first of all intelligent men, to tell me everything.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Once on a time (king Dushmanta) of mighty arms,<br>accompanied by a large force, went into the forest. And he took with him<br>hundreds of horses and elephants. And the force that accompanied the<br>monarch was of four kinds (foot-soldiers, car-warriors, cavalry, and<br>elephants)&#8212;heroes armed with swords and darts and bearing in their hands<br>maces and stout clubs. And surrounded by hundreds of warriors with lances<br>and spears in their hands, the monarch set out on his journey. And with<br>the leonine roars of the warriors and the notes of conchs and sound of<br>drums, with the rattle of the car-wheels and shrieks of huge elephants,<br>all mingling with the neighing of horses and the clash of weapons of the<br>variously armed attendants in diverse dresses, there arose a deafening<br>tumult while the king was on his march. And ladies gifted with great<br>beauty beheld from the terraces of goodly mansions that heroic monarch,<br>the achiever of his own fame. And the ladies saw that he was like unto<br>Sakra, the slayer of his enemies, capable of repulsing the elephants of<br>foes&#8212;And they believed that he was the wielder of the thunderbolt<br>himself. And they said, 'This is that tiger among men who in battle is<br>equal unto the Vasus in prowess, and in consequence of the might of whose<br>arms no foes are left.' And saying this, the ladies from affection<br>gratified the monarch by showering flowers on his head. And followed by<br>foremost of Brahmanas uttering blessings all the way, the king in great<br>gladness of heart went towards the forest, eager for slaying the deer.<br>And many Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras, followed the monarch<br>who was like unto the king of the celestials seated on the back of a<br>proud elephant. The citizens and other classes followed the monarch for<br>some distance. And they at last refrained from going farther at the<br>command of the king. And the king, then, ascending his chariot of winged<br>speed, filled the whole earth and even the heavens, with the rattle of<br>his chariot wheels. And, as he went, he saw around him a forest like unto<br>Nandana itself (the celestial garden). And it was full of Vilwa, Arka,<br>Khadira (catechu), Kapittha (wood-apple) and Dhava trees. And he saw that<br>the soil was uneven and scattered over with blocks of stone loosened from<br>the neighbouring cliffs. And he saw that it was without water and without<br>human beings and lay extended for many Yojanas around. And it was full of<br>deer, and lions, and other terrible beasts of prey.<br><br>"And king Dushmanta, that tiger among men, assisted by his followers and<br>the warriors in his train, agitated that forest, killing numerous<br>animals. And Dushmanta, piercing them with his arrows, felled numerous<br>tigers that were within shooting range. And the king wounded many that<br>were too distant, and killed many that were too near with his heavy<br>sword. And that foremost of all wielders of darts killed many by hurling<br>his darts at them. And well-conversant with the art of whirling the mace,<br>the king of immeasurable prowess fearlessly wandered over the forest. And<br>the king roamed about, killing the denizens of the wilderness sometimes<br>with his sword and sometimes by fast-descending blows of his mace and<br>heavy club.<br><br>"And when the forest was so disturbed by the king possessed of wonderful<br>energy and by the warriors in his train delighting in warlike sports, the<br>lions began to desert it in numbers. And herds of animals deprived of<br>their leaders, from fear and anxiety began to utter loud cries as they<br>fled in all directions. And fatigued with running, they began to fall<br>down on all sides, unable to slake their thirst, having reached<br>river-beds that were perfectly dry. And many so falling were eaten up by<br>the hungry warriors. While others were eaten up after having been duly<br>quartered and roasted in fires lit up by them. And many strong elephants,<br>maddened with the wounds they received and alarmed beyond measure, fled<br>with trunks raised on high. And those wild elephants, betraying the usual<br>symptoms of alarm by urinating and ejecting the contents of their<br>stomachs and vomiting blood in large quantities, trampled, as they ran,<br>many warriors to death. And that forest which had been full of animals,<br>was by the king with his bands of followers and with sharp weapons soon<br>made bereft of lions and tigers and other monarchs of the wilderness.'"
