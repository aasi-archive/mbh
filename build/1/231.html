                            (Khandava-daha Parva continued)<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'O Brahmana, tell me why and when that forest burnt in<br>that way, Agni consumed not the birds called Sarngakas? Thou hast, O<br>Brahmana, recited (to us) the cause of Aswasena and the Danava Maya not<br>having been consumed. But thou hast not as yet said what the cause was of<br>the escape of the Sarngakas? The escape of those birds, O Brahmana,<br>appeareth to me to be wonderful. Tell us why they were not destroyed in<br>that dreadful conflagration.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'O slayer of all foes, I shall tell thee all as to<br>why Agni did not burn up those birds during the conflagration. There was,<br>O king, a great Rishi known by the name of Mandapala, conversant with all<br>the shastras, of rigid vows, devoted to asceticism, and the foremost of<br>all virtuous persons. Following in the wake of Rishis that had drawn up<br>their virile fluid, that ascetic, O monarch, with every sense under<br>complete control, devoted himself to study and virtue. Having reached the<br>opposite shores of asceticism, O Bharata, he left his human form and went<br>to the region of the Pitris. But going thither he failed to obtain the<br>(expected) fruit of his acts. He asked the celestials that sat around the<br>king of the dead as to the cause of his treatment, saying, 'Why have<br>these regions become unattainable by me,&#8212;regions that I had thought had<br>been acquired by me by my ascetic devotions? Have I not performed those<br>acts whose fruits are these regions? Ye inhabitants of heaven, tell me<br>why these regions are shut against me! I will do that which will give me<br>the fruit of my ascetic penances.'<br><br>"The celestials answered, 'Hear, O Brahmana, of those acts and things on<br>account of which men are born debtors. Without doubt, it is for religious<br>rites, studies according to the ordinance, and progeny, that men are born<br>debtors. These debts are all discharged by sacrifices, asceticism, and<br>offspring. Thou art an ascetic and hast also performed sacrifices; but<br>thou hast no offspring. These regions are shut against thee only for want<br>of children. Beget children, therefore! Thou shalt then enjoy<br>multifarious regions of felicity. The Vedas declared that the son<br>rescueth the father from a hell called Put. Then, O best of Brahmanas,<br>strive to beget offspring.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Mandapala, having heard these words of the<br>dwellers in heaven, reflected how best he could obtain the largest number<br>of offspring within the shortest period of time. The Rishi, after<br>reflection, understood that of all creatures birds alone were blest with<br>fecundity. Assuming the form of a Sarngaka the Rishi had connection with<br>a female bird of the same species called by the name of Jarita. And he<br>begat upon her four sons who were all reciters of the Vedas. Leaving all<br>those sons of his with their mother in that forest, while they were still<br>within eggs, the ascetic went to (another wife called by the name of)<br>Lapita. And, O Bharata, when the exalted sage went away for the company<br>of Lapita, moved by affection for her offspring, Jarita became very<br>thoughtful. Though forsaken by their father in the forest of Khandava,<br>Jarita, anxious in her affection for them, could not forsake her<br>offspring, those infant Rishis encased in eggs. Moved by parental<br>affection, she brought up these children born of her, herself following<br>the pursuits proper to her own species. Some time after, the Rishi, in<br>wandering over that forest in the company of Lapita, saw Agni coming<br>towards Khandava to burn it down. Then the Brahmana Mandapala, knowing<br>the intention of Agni and remembering also that his children were all<br>young moved by fear, gratified the god, of the burning element, that<br>regent of the universe, endued with great energy. And he did this,<br>desiring to put in a word for his unfledged offspring. Addressing Agni,<br>the Rishi said, 'Thou art, O Agni, the mouth of all the worlds! Thou art<br>the carrier of the sacrificial butter! O purifier (of all sins), thou<br>movest invisible with the frame of every creature! The learned have<br>spoken of thee as an One, and again as possessed of triple nature. The<br>wise perform their sacrifices before thee, taking thee as consisting of<br>eight (mouths). The great Rishis declare that this universe hath been<br>created by thee. O thou that feedest on sacrificial butter, without thee<br>this whole universe would be destroyed in a single day. Bowing to thee,<br>the Brahmanas, accompanied by their wives and children, go to eternal<br>regions won by them by help of their own deeds. O Agni, the learned<br>represent thee as the clouds in the heavens charged with lightning. O<br>Agni, the flames put forth by thee consume every creature. O thou of<br>great splendour, this universe hath been created by thee. The Vedas are<br>thy word. All creatures, mobile and immobile, depend upon thee. Water<br>primarily dependeth on thee, so also the whole of this universe. All<br>offerings of clarified butter and oblations of food to the pitris have<br>been established in thee. O god, thou art the consumer, and thou art the<br>creator and thou art Vrihaspati himself (in intelligence). Thou art the<br>twin Aswins; thou art Surya; thou art Soma; thou art Vayu.<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'O monarch, thus praised by Mandapala, Agni was<br>gratified with that Rishi of immeasurable energy; and the god,<br>well-pleased, replied, 'What good can I do to thee?' Then Mandapala with<br>joined palms said unto the carrier of clarified butter, 'While thou<br>burnest the forest of Khandava, spare my children.' The illustrious<br>bearer of clarified butter replied, 'So be it.' It was, therefore, O<br>monarch, that he blazed not forth, while consuming the forest of<br>Khandava, for the destruction of Mandapala's children.'"
