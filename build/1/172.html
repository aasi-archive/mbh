                            (Chaitraratha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'After Vyasa had gone away, those bulls among men,<br>the Pandavas, saluted the Brahmana and bade him farewell, and proceeded<br>(towards Panchala) with joyous hearts and with their mother walking<br>before them. Those slayers of all foes, in order to reach their<br>destination, proceeded in a due northerly direction, walking day and<br>night till they reached a sacred shrine of Siva with the crescent mark on<br>his brow. Then those tigers among men, the sons of Pandu, arrived at the<br>banks of the Ganga. Dhananjaya, that mighty car-warrior, walking before<br>them, torch in hand, for showing the way and guarding them (against wild<br>animals). And it so happened that at that time the proud king of the<br>Gandharvas, with his wives, was sporting in that solitary region in the<br>delightful waters of the Ganga. The king of the Gandharvas heard the<br>tread of the Pandavas as they approached the river. On hearing the sounds<br>of their foot-steps, the mighty Gandharvas were inflamed with wrath, and<br>beholding those chastisers of foes, the Pandavas, approach towards him<br>with their mother, he drew his frightful bow to a circle and said, 'It is<br>known that excepting the first forty seconds the grey twilight preceding<br>nightfall hath been appointed for the wandering of the Yakshas, the<br>Gandharvas and the Rakshasas, all of whom are capable of going everywhere<br>at will. The rest of the time hath been appointed for man to do his work.<br>If therefore, men, wandering during those moments from greed of gain,<br>come near us, both we and the Rakshasas slay those fools. Therefore,<br>persons acquainted with the Vedas never applaud those men&#8212;not even kings<br>at the head of their troops&#8212;who approach any pools of water at such a<br>time. Stay ye at a distance, and approach me not. Know ye not that I am<br>bathing in the waters of the Bhagirathi? Know that I am Angaraparna the<br>Gandharva, ever relying on my own strength! I am proud and haughty and am<br>the friend of Kuvera. This my forest on the banks of the Ganga, where I<br>sport to gratify all my senses, is called Angaraparna after my own name.<br>Here neither gods, nor Kapalikas, nor Gandharvas nor Yakshas, can come.<br>How dare ye approach me who am the brightest jewel on the diadem of<br>Kuvera?'<br><br>"Hearing these words of the Gandharva, Arjuna said, 'Blockhead, whether<br>it be day, night, or twilight, who can bar others from the ocean, the<br>sides of the Himalayas, and this river? O ranger of the skies, whether<br>the stomach be empty or full, whether it is night or day, there is no<br>special time for anybody to come to the Ganga&#8212;that foremost of all<br>rivers. As regards ourselves endued with might, we care not when we<br>disturb thee. Wicked being, those who are weak in fighting worship thee.<br>This Ganga, issuing out of the golden peaks of Himavat, falleth into the<br>waters of the ocean, being distributed into seven streams. They who drink<br>the waters of these seven streams, viz., Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswati,<br>Vitashtha, Sarayu, Gomati, and Gandaki, are, cleansed of all their sins.<br>O Gandharva, this sacred Ganga again, flowing through the celestial<br>region is called there the Alakananda, It hath again in the region of the<br>Pitris become the Vaitarani, difficult of being crossed by sinners, and,<br>Krishna-Dwaipayana himself hath said so. The auspicious and celestial<br>river, capable of leading to heaven (them that touch its waters), is free<br>from all dangers. Why dost thou then desire to bar us from it? This act<br>of thine is not in consonance with eternal virtue. Disregarding thy<br>words, why shall we not touch the sacred waters of the Bhagirathi free<br>from all dangers and from which none can bar us?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of Arjuna, Angaraparna<br>became inflamed with wrath and drawing his bow to a circle began to shoot<br>his arrows like venomous snakes at the Pandavas. Then Dhananjaya, the son<br>of Pandu, wielding a good shield and the torch he held in his hand,<br>warded off all those arrows and addressing the Gandharva again said, 'O<br>Gandharva, seek not to terrify those that are skilled in weapons, for<br>weapons hurled at them vanish like froth. I think, O Gandharva, that ye<br>are superior (in prowess) to men; therefore shall I fight with thee,<br>using celestial weapons and not with any crooked means. This fiery weapon<br>(that I shall hurl at thee), Vrihaspati the revered preceptor of Indra,<br>gave unto Bharadwaja, from whom it was obtained by Agnivesya, and from<br>Agnivesya by my preceptor, that foremost of Brahmanas, Drona, who gave it<br>away to me.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Saying these words, the Pandava wrathfully<br>hurled at the Gandharva that blazing weapon made of fire which burnt the<br>Gandharva's chariot in a trice. Deprived of consciousness by the force of<br>that weapon, the mighty Gandharva was falling, head downward, from his<br>chariot. Dhananjaya seized him by the hair of his head adorned with<br>garlands of flowers and thus dragged the unconscious Gandharva towards<br>his brothers. Beholding this, that Gandharva's wife Kumbhinasi, desirous<br>of saving her husband, ran towards Yudhishthira and sought his<br>protection. The Gandharvi said, 'O exalted one, extend to me thy<br>protection! O, set my husband free! O lord, I am Kumbhinasi by name, the<br>wife of this Gandharva, who seeketh thy protection!' Beholding her (so<br>afflicted), the mighty Yudhishthira addressed Arjuna and said, 'O slayer<br>of foes, O child, who would slay a foe who hath been vanquished in fight,<br>who hath been deprived of fame, who is protected by a woman, and who hath<br>no prowess?' Arjuna replied, saying, 'Keep thou thy life, O Gandharva! Go<br>hence, and grieve not I Yudhishthira, the king of the Kurus, commandeth<br>me to show thee mercy.'<br><br>"The Gandharva replied, 'I have been vanquished by thee, I shall,<br>therefore, abandon my former name Angaraparna (the blazing vehicle). In<br>name alone, O friend, I should not be boastful when my pride in my<br>strength hath been overcome: I have been fortunate in that I have<br>obtained thee; O Arjuna, that wielder of celestial weapons! I like to<br>impart to thee the power of (producing) illusions which Gandharvas alone<br>have. My excellent and variegated chariot hath been burnt by means of thy<br>fiery weapon. I who had formerly been called after my excellent chariot<br>should now be called after my burnt chariot. The science of producing<br>illusions that I have spoken of was formerly obtained by me by ascetic<br>penances. That science I will today impart to the giver of my life-thy<br>illustrious self! What good luck doth he not deserve who, after<br>overcoming a foe by his might, giveth him life when that foe asketh for<br>it? This science is called Chakshushi. It was communicated by Manu unto<br>Soma and by Soma unto Viswavasu, and lastly by Viswavasu unto me.<br>Communicated by my preceptor, that science, having come unto me who am<br>without energy, is gradually becoming fruitless. I have spoken to thee<br>about its origin and transmission. Listen now to its power! One may see<br>(by its aid) whatever one wisheth to see, and in whatever way he liketh<br>(generally or particularly). One can acquire this science only after<br>standing on one leg for six months. I shall however, communicate to thee<br>this science without thyself being obliged to observe any rigid vow. O<br>king, it is for this knowledge that we are superior to men. And as we are<br>capable of seeing everything by spiritual sight, we are equal to the<br>gods. O best of men, I intend to give thee and each of thy brothers a<br>hundred steeds born in the country of the Gandharvas. Of celestial colour<br>and endued with the speed of the mind, those horses are employed in<br>bearing the celestial, and the Gandharvas. They may be lean-fleshed but<br>they tire not, nor doth their speed suffer on that account. In days of<br>yore the thunderbolt was created for the chief of the celestials in order<br>that he might slay (the Asura) Vritra with it. But hurled at Vritra's<br>head it broke in a thousand pieces. The celestials worship with reverence<br>those fragments of the thunderbolt. That which is known in the three<br>worlds as glory is but a portion of the thunderbolt. The hand of the<br>Brahmana with which he poureth libations on the sacrificial fire, the<br>chariot upon which the Kshatriya fighteth, the charity of the Vaisya, and<br>the service of the Sudra rendered unto the three other classes, are all<br>fragments of the thunderbolt. It hath been said that horses, forming as<br>they do a portion of the Kshatriya's chariot, are, on that account,<br>unslayable. Again horses which form a portion of the Kshatriya's chariot,<br>are the offspring of Vadava. Those amongst them that are born in the<br>region of the Gandharvas can go everywhere and assume any hue and speed<br>at the will of their owners. These horses of mine that I give thee will<br>always gratify thy wishes."<br><br>"On hearing these words of the Gandharva, Arjuna said, 'O Gandharva, if<br>from satisfaction for having obtained thy life at my hands in a situation<br>of danger, thou givest me thy science, and these horses, I would not<br>accept thy gift.' The Gandharva replied, saying, 'A meeting with an<br>illustrious person is ever a source of gratification; besides thou hast<br>given me my life. Gratified with thee, I will give thee my science. That<br>the obligation, however, may not all be on one side, I will take from<br>thee, O Vibhatsu, O bull in Bharata's race, thy excellent and eternal<br>weapon of fire!'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'I would accept thy horses in exchange for my weapon. Let<br>our friendship last for ever. O friend, tell us for what we human beings<br>have to stand in fear of the Gandharvas. Chastisers of foes that we are<br>and virtuous and conversant with the Vedas, tell us, O Gandharva, why in<br>travelling in the night-time we have been censured by thee.'<br><br>"The Gandharva said, 'Ye are without wives (though ye have completed the<br>period of study). Ye are without a particular Asrama (mode of life).<br>Lastly, ye are out without a Brahmana walking before, therefore, ye sons<br>of Pandu, ye have been censured by me. The Yakshas, Rakshasas,<br>Gandharvas, Pisachas, Uragas and Danavas, are possessed of wisdom and<br>intelligence, and acquainted with the history of the Kuru race. O hero, I<br>have heard too from Narada and other celestial Rishis about the good<br>deeds of your wise ancestors. I myself, too, while roaming over the whole<br>earth bounded by her belt of seas, have witnessed the prowess of thy<br>great race. O Arjuna, I have personal knowledge of thy preceptor, the<br>illustrious son of Bharadwaja, celebrated throughout the three worlds for<br>his knowledge of the Vedas and the science of arms. O tiger in Kuru's<br>race, O son of Pritha, I also know Dharma, Vayu, Sakra, the twin Aswins,<br>and Pandu,&#8212;these six perpetuators of Kuru race,&#8212;these excellent<br>celestials and human progenitors of you all. I also know that you five<br>brothers are learned and high-souled, that ye are foremost of all<br>wielders of weapons, that ye are brave and virtuous and observant of<br>vows. Knowing that your understanding and hearts are excellent and your<br>behaviour faultless, I have yet censured you. For, O thou of Kuru's race,<br>it behoveth no man endued with might of arms to bear with patience any<br>ill usage in the sight of his wife. Especially as, O son of Kunti, our<br>might increaseth during the hours of darkness, accompanied by my wife I<br>was filled with wrath. O best of vow-observing men, I have, however, been<br>vanquished by thee in battle. Listen to me as I tell thee the reasons<br>that have led to my discomfiture. The Brahmacharya is a very superior<br>mode of life, and as thou art in that mode now, it is for this, O Partha,<br>that I have been defeated by thee in battle. O chastiser of foes, if any<br>married Kshatriya fight with us at night, he can never escape, with life.<br>But, O Partha, a married Kshatriya, who is sanctified with Brahma, and<br>who hath assigned the cares of his State to a priest, might vanquish! all<br>wanderers in the night. O child of Tapati, men should therefore, ever<br>employ learned priests possessing self-command for the acquisition of<br>every good luck they desire. That Brahmana is worthy of being the king's<br>priest who is learned in the Vedas and the six branches thereof, who is<br>pure and truthful, who is of virtuous soul and possessed of self-command.<br>The monarch becometh ever victorious and finally earneth heaven who hath<br>for his priest a Brahmana conversant with the rules of morality, who is a<br>master of words, and is pure and of good behaviour. The king should<br>always select an accomplished priest in order to acquire what he hath not<br>and protect what he hath. He who desireth his own prosperity should ever<br>be guided by his priest, for he may then obtain ever the whole earth<br>surrounded by her belt of seas. O son of Tapati, a king, who is without a<br>Brahmana, can never acquire any land by his bravery or glory of birth<br>alone. Know, therefore, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, that the kingdom<br>lasteth for ever in which Brahmanas have power.'"
