                            (Chaitraratha Parva)<br><br>After this citizens returned to their respective houses and the Pandavas<br>continued to dwell at Ekachakra as before.<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'O Brahmana, what did those tigers among men, the<br>Pandavas, do after they had slain the Rakshasa Vaka?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'The Pandavas, O king, after slaying the Rakshasa<br>Vaka, continued to dwell in the abode of that Brahmana, employed in the<br>study of the Vedas. Within a few days there came a Brahmana of rigid vows<br>unto the abode of their host to take up his quarters there. Their host,<br>that bull among Brahmanas, ever hospitable unto all guests, worshipping<br>the newly-arrived Brahmana with due ceremonies, gave him quarters in his<br>own abode. Then those bulls among men, the Pandavas, with their mother<br>Kunti, solicited the new lodger to narrate to them his interesting<br>experiences. The Brahmana spake to them of various countries and shrines<br>and (holy) rivers, of kings and many wonderful provinces and cities. And<br>after this narration was over, that Brahmana, O Janamejaya, also spoke of<br>the wonderful self-choice of Yajnasena's daughter, the princes of<br>Panchala, and of the births of Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandi, and of the<br>birth, without the intervention of a woman, of Krishna (Draupadi) at the<br>great sacrifice of Drupada.<br><br>"Then those bulls among men, the Pandavas, hearing of these extraordinary<br>facts regarding that illustrious monarch (Drupada), and desiring to know<br>the details thereof, asked the Brahmana, after his narration was<br>concluded, to satisfy their curiosity. The Pandavas said, 'How, O<br>Brahmana, did the birth of Dhrishtadyumna the son of Drupada, take place<br>from the (sacrificial) fire? How also did the extraordinary birth of<br>Krishna take place from the centre of the sacrificial platform? How also<br>did Drupada's son learn all weapons from the great bowman Drona? And, O<br>Brahmana, how and for whom and for what reason was the friendship between<br>Drona and Drupada broken off?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus questioned, O monarch, by those bulls<br>among men, the Brahmana narrated all the particulars about the birth of<br>Draupadi.'"
