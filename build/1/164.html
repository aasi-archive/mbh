                            (Vaka-vadha Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'After Bhima had pledged himself to accomplish the<br>task, saying, 'I will do it,' the Pandavas, O Bharata, returned home with<br>the alms they had obtained during the day. Then Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Pandu from Bhima's countenance alone, suspected the nature of the task he<br>had undertaken to accomplish. Sitting by the side of his mother,<br>Yudhishthira asked her in private, 'What is the task, O mother, that<br>Bhima of terrible prowess seeketh to accomplish? Doth he do so at thy<br>command or of his own accord?' Kunti replied, 'Bhima, that chastiser of<br>foes, will at my command, do this great deed for the good of the Brahmana<br>and the liberation of this town.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'What rash act hast thou done, O mother! It is<br>difficult of being performed and almost amounteth to suicide! The learned<br>never applaud the abandonment of one's own child. Why dost thou, O<br>mother, wish to sacrifice thy own child for the sake of another's? Thou<br>hast, O mother, by this abandonment of thy child, acted not only against<br>the course of human practices but also against the teachings of the<br>Vedas, That Bhima, relying on whose arms we sleep happily in the night<br>and hope to recover the kingdom of which we have been deprived by the<br>covetous son of Dhritarashtra, that hero of immeasurable energy,<br>remembering whose prowess Duryodhana and Sakuni do not sleep a wink<br>during the whole night and by whose prowess we were rescued from the<br>palace of lac and various other dangers, that Bhima who caused the death<br>of Purochana, and relying on whose might we regard ourselves as having<br>already slain the sons of Dhritarashtra and acquired the whole earth with<br>all her wealth, upon what considerations, O mother, hast thou resolved<br>upon abandoning him? Hast thou been deprived of thy reason? Hath thy<br>understanding been clouded by the calamities thou hast undergone?'<br><br>"On hearing these words of her son, Kunti said, 'O Yudhishthira, thou<br>needst not be at all anxious on account of Vrikodara. I have not come to<br>this resolve owing to any weakness of understanding. Respected by him,<br>and with our sorrows assuaged, we have, O son, been living in the house<br>of this Brahmana, unknown to the sons of Dhritarashtra. For requiting, O<br>son, that Brahmana, I have resolved to do this. He, indeed, is a man upon<br>whom good offices are never lost. The measure of his requital becometh<br>greater than the measure of the services he receiveth. Beholding the<br>prowess of Bhima on the occasion of (our escape from) the house of lac,<br>and from the destruction also of Hidimva, my confidence in Vrikodara is<br>great. The might of Bhima's arms is equal unto that of ten thousand<br>elephants. It was, therefore, that he succeeded in carrying you all, each<br>heavy as an elephant, from Varanavata. There is no one on earth equal<br>unto Bhima in might; he may even overcome that foremost of warriors, the<br>holder of the thunderbolt himself. Soon after his birth he fell from my<br>lap on the breast of the mountain. By the weight of his body the mass of<br>stone on which he fell down broke in pieces. From this also, O son of<br>Pandu, I have come to know Bhima's might. For this reason have I resolved<br>to set him against the Brahmana's foe. I have not acted in this from<br>foolishness or ignorance or from motive of gain. I have deliberately<br>resolved to do this virtuous deed. By this act, O Yudhishthira, two<br>objects will be accomplished; one is a requital of the services rendered<br>by the Brahmana and the other is the acquisition of high religious merit.<br>It is my conviction that the Kshatriya who rendereth help unto a Brahmana<br>in anything acquireth regions of bliss hereafter. So also a Kshatriya who<br>saveth the life of a Kshatriya achieveth that great fame in this world as<br>in the other. A Kshatriya rendering help unto a Vaisya also on this earth<br>certainly acquires world-wide popularity. One of the kingly tribe should<br>protect even the Sudra who cometh to him for protection. If he doeth so,<br>in his next life he receiveth his birth in a royal line, commanding<br>prosperity and the respect of other kings. O scion of Puru's race, the<br>illustrious Vyasa of wisdom acquired by hard ascetic toil told me so in<br>bygone days. It is therefore, that I have resolved upon accomplishing<br>this.'"
