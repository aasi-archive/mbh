                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Bhishma excited with wrath in battle,<br>surrounded on all sides by the Pandavas like the Sun in the firmament. O<br>king, by the clouds at the end of summer, Duryodhana, O monarch,<br>addressed Dussasana, saying, 'This heroic and great bowman Bhishma, this<br>slayer of heroes, hath, O bull of Bharata's race, been surrounded on all<br>sides by the brave Pandavas. It is thy duty, O hero, to protect that<br>illustrious one. Protected by us in battle, our grandsire Bhishma will<br>slay all the Panchalas along with the Pandavas. The protection of<br>Bhishma. therefore, I think, is our highest duty, for this great bowman<br>of his vows, viz., Bhishma, is our protector in return. Therefore,<br>surrounding the grandsire with all our troops, do thou protect him, who<br>always achieveth the most difficult feats in battle. Thus addressed by<br>Duryodhana, thy son Dussasana, surrounding Bhishma with a large force on<br>all sides took up his position. Then Suvala's son Sakuni, with hundreds<br>and thousands of horsemen having bright spears and swords and lances in<br>hand, and who formed a proud, well-dressed, and strong body bearing<br>standards, and who were mingled with excellent foot-soldiers that were<br>all well-trained and skilled in battle began to cheek Nakula, and<br>Sahadeva, and Yudhishthira the son of Pandu, surrounding those foremost<br>of men on all sides. Then king Duryodhana despatched ten thousand (other)<br>brave horsemen for resisting the Pandavas. When these rushed like so many<br>Garudas towards the enemy with great impetuosity, the earth, O king,<br>struck with their horse-hoofs, trembled and uttered a loud noise. And the<br>loud clatter of their hoofs was heard resembling the noise made by a<br>large forest of bamboos, in conflagration on a mountain. And as these<br>dashed over the field, there rose a cloud of dust, which rising to the<br>welkin shrouded the very Sun. And in consequence of those impetuous<br>steeds, the Pandava army was agitated like a large lake with a flight of<br>swans suddenly alighting on its bosom. And in consequence of their<br>neighing, nothing else could be heard there. Then king Yudhishthira, and<br>the two sons of Pandu by Madri, quickly checked the charge of those<br>horsemen in battle, like the continent, O king, bearing the force, at<br>full tide, of the surging sea swollen with the waters of the rainy<br>season. Then those (three) car-warriors, O monarch, with their straight<br>shafts, cut off the heads of those horse-riders. Slain by those strong<br>bowmen, they fell down, O king, (on the earth), like mighty elephants<br>tumbling into mountain caves, slain by huge compeers. Indeed, coursing<br>all over the field, those warriors (of the Pandavas army) cut off the<br>heads of those cavalry soldiers with sharp-bearded darts and straight<br>shafts. Struck with swords, those horsemen, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>suffered their heads to drop like tall trees, dropping their fruits. All<br>over the field, O king, steeds along with their riders were seen fallen<br>or falling, deprived of life. And while being (thus) slaughtered, the<br>steeds, affected with panic, fled away like smaller animals desirous of<br>saving their lives at sight of the lion. And the Pandavas, O king, having<br>vanquished their foes in that great battle, blew their conches and beat<br>their drums. Then Duryodhana, filled with grief on seeing his troops<br>vanquished, addressed the ruler of the Madras, O chief of the Bharatas,<br>and said, 'There, the eldest son of Pandu, accompanied by the twins in<br>battle, in thy very sight, O thou of mighty arms, routeth our troops, O<br>lord. O mighty-armed one, resist him like the continent resisting the<br>ocean. Thou art exceedingly well-known as possessed of might and prowess<br>that are irresistible.' Hearing these words of thy son, the valiant Salya<br>proceeded with a large body of cars to the spot where Yudhishthira was.<br>Thereupon, the son of Pandu began to resist in battle that large host of<br>Salya rushing impetuously towards him with the force of a mighty wave.<br>And that mighty car-warrior, viz., king Yudhishthira the just, in that<br>battle quickly pierced the ruler of the Madras in the centre of the chest<br>with ten shafts. And Nakula and Sahadeva struck him with seven straight<br>shafts. The ruler of the Madras then struck each of them with three<br>arrows. And once more he pierced Yudhishthira with sixty sharp-pointed<br>arrows. And excited with wrath he struck each of the sons of Madri also<br>with two shafts. Then that vanquisher of foes, the mighty-armed Bhima,<br>beholding the king, in that great battle, staying within reach of Salya's<br>car as if within the very jaws of Death, quickly proceeded to<br>Yudhishthira's side. Then when the Sun, having passed the meridian, was<br>sinking, there commenced a fierce and terrible battle (on that part of<br>the field).
