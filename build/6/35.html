                            [(Bhagavad Gita Chapter XI)]<br><br>"Arjuna said,&#8212;'This discourse about the supreme mystery, called<br>Adhyatman, which thou hast uttered for my welfare, hath dispelled my<br>delusion.[247] For I have heard at large from thee of the creation and<br>dissolution of beings, O thou of eyes like lotus petals, and also of thy<br>greatness that knoweth no deterioration. What thou hast said about<br>thyself, O great Lord, is even so. O best of Male Beings, I desire to<br>behold thy sovereign form. If, O Lord, thou thinkest that I am competent<br>to behold that (form), then, O Lord of mystic power, show me thy eternal<br>Self.[248]'<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'Behold, O son of Pritha, my forms by hundreds and<br>thousands, various, divine, diverse in hue and shape. Behold the Adityas,<br>the Vasus, the Rudras, the Aswins, and the Maruts. Behold, O Bharata,<br>innumerable marvels unseen before (by thee). Behold, O thou of curly<br>hair, the entire universe of mobiles and immobiles, collected together in<br>this body of mine, whatever else thou mayst wish to see.[249] Thou art,<br>however, not competent to behold me with this eye of thine. I give thee<br>celestial sight. Behold my sovereign mystic nature.'"<br><br>Sanjaya continued,&#8212;"Having said this, O monarch, Hari, the mighty Lord<br>of mystic power, then revealed to the son of Pritha his Supreme sovereign<br>form, with many mouths and eyes, many wonderous aspects, many celestial<br>ornaments, many celestial weapons uplifted, wearing celestial garlands<br>and robes, (and) with unguents of celestial fragrance, full of every<br>wonder, resplendent, infinite, with faces turned on all sides.[250] If<br>the splendour of a thousand suns were to burst forth at once in the sky,<br>(then) that would be like the splendour of that Mighty One. The son of<br>Pandu then beheld there in the body of that God of gods the entire<br>universe divided and sub-divided into many parts, all collected<br>together.[251] Then Dhananjaya, filled with amazement, (and) with hair<br>standing on end, bowing with (his) head, with joined hands addressed the<br>God.<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'I behold all the gods, O God, as also all the varied hosts<br>of creatures, (and) Brahman seated on (his) lotus seat, and all the<br>Rishis and the celestial snakes. I behold Thee with innumerable arms,<br>stomachs, mouths, (and) eyes, on every side, O thou of infinite forms.<br>Neither end nor middle, nor also beginning of thine do I behold, O Lord<br>of the universe, O thou of universal form. Bearing (thy) diadem, mace,<br>and discus, a mass of energy, glowing on all sides, do I behold thee that<br>art hard to look at, endued on all sides with the effulgence of the<br>blazing fire or the Sun, (and) immeasurable. Thou art indestructible,<br>(and) the Supreme object of this universe. Thou art without decay, the<br>guardian of eternal virtue. I regard thee to be the eternal (male) Being.<br>I behold thee to be without beginning, mean, end, to be of infinite<br>prowess, of innumerable arms, having the Sun and the Moon for thy eyes,<br>the blazing fire for thy mouth, and heating this universe with energy of<br>thy own. For the space betwixt heaven and earth is pervaded by Thee<br>alone, as also all the points of the horizon. At sight of this marvellous<br>and fierce form of thine, O Supreme Soul, the triple world trembleth. For<br>these hosts of gods are entering thee. Some, afraid, are praying with<br>joined hands. Saying Hail to Thee&#8212;the hosts of great Rishis and Siddhas<br>praise Thee with copious hymns of praise.[252] The Rudras, the Adityas,<br>the Vasus, they that (called) the Siddhas, the Viswas, the Aswins, the<br>Maruts, also the Ushmapas, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the Asuras, the<br>hosts of Siddhyas, behold Thee and are all amazed. Beholding Thy mighty<br>form with many mouths and eyes, O mighty-armed one, with innumerable<br>arms, thighs and feet, many stomachs, (and) terrible in consequence of<br>many tusks, all creatures are frightened and I also. Indeed, touching the<br>very skies, of blazing radiance, many-hued, mouth wide-open, with eyes<br>that are blazing and large, beholding thee, O Vishnu, with (my) inner<br>soul trembling (in fright), I can no longer command courage and peace of<br>mind. Beholding thy mouths that are terrible in consequence of (their)<br>tusks, and that are fierce (as the all-destroying fire at the end of the<br>Yuga), I cannot recognise the points of the horizon nor can I command<br>peace of mind. Be gracious, O God of gods, O thou that art the refuge of<br>the Universe. And all these sons of Dhritarashtra, together with the<br>hosts of kings, and Bhishma, and Drona, and also this Suta's son (Karna),<br>accompanied by even the principal warriors of our side, are quickly<br>entering thy terrible mouths rendered fierce by thy tusks. Some, with<br>their heads crushed, are seen striking at the interstices of (thy) teeth.<br>As many currents of water flowing through different channels roll rapidly<br>towards the ocean, so these heroes of the world of men enter thy mouths<br>that flame all around. As moths with increasing speed rush for (their<br>own) destruction to the blazing fire, so also do (these) people, with<br>unceasing speed, enter thy mouths for (their) destruction. Swallowing all<br>these men from every side, thou lickest them with thy flaming mouths.<br>Filling the whole universe with (thy) energy, thy fierce splendours, O<br>Vishnu, are heating (everything). Tell me who thou art of (such) fierce<br>form. I bow to thee, O chief of the gods, be gracious to me. I desire to<br>know thee that art the Primeval One, I do not understand thy action.'[253]<br><br>The Holy One said, "I am Death, the destroyer of the worlds, fully<br>developed. I am now engaged in slaying the race of men. Without thee all<br>these warriors standing in the different divisions shall cease to<br>be.[254] Wherefore, arise, gain glory, (and) vanquishing the foe, enjoy<br>(this) swelling kingdom. By me have all these been already slain. Be only<br>(my) instrument. O thou that can'st draw the bow with (even) the left<br>hand. Drona and Bhishma, and Jayadratha, and Karna, and also other heroic<br>warriors, (already) slain by me, do thou slay. Be not dismayed, fight;<br>thou shalt conquer in battle (thy) foes."<br><br>Sanjaya continued,&#8212;"Hearing these words of Kesava, the diadem-decked<br>(Arjuna), trembling, (and) with joined-hands, bowed (unto him); and once<br>more said unto Krishna, with voice choked up and overwhelmed with fear,<br>and making his salutations (to him).&#8212;<br><br>Arjuna said, "It is meet, Hrishikesa, that the universe is delighted and<br>charmed in uttering thy praise, and the Rakshasas flee in fear in all<br>directions, and the hosts of the Siddhas bow down (to thee). And why<br>should they not bow down to thee, O Supreme Soul, that are greater than<br>even Brahman (himself), and the primal cause? O thou that art Infinite. O<br>God of the gods, O thou that art the refuge of the universe, thou art<br>indestructible, thou art that which is, and that which is not and that<br>which is beyond (both). Thou art the First God, the ancient (male) Being,<br>thou art the Supreme refuge of this universe. Thou art the Knower, thou<br>art the Object to be known, thou art the highest abode. By thee is<br>pervaded this universe, O thou of infinite form.[255] Thou art Vayu,<br>Yama, Agni, Varuna, Moon, Prajapati, and Grandsire. Obeisance be to thee<br>a thousand times, and again and yet again obeisance to thee. Obeisance to<br>thee in front, and also from behind. Let obeisance be to thee from every<br>side, O thou that art all. Thou art all, of energy that is infinite, and<br>prowess that is immeasurable. Thou embracest the All. Regarding (thee) a<br>friend whatever hath been said by me carelessly, such as&#8212;O Krishna, O<br>Yadava, O friend,&#8212;not knowing this thy greatness from want of judgement<br>or from love either, whatever disrespect hath been shown thee for purpose<br>of mirth, on occasions of play, lying, sitting, (or) at meals, while<br>alone or in the presence of others, O undeteriorating one, I beg thy<br>pardon for it, that art immeasurable. Thou art the father of this<br>universe of mobiles and immobiles. Thou art the great master deserving of<br>worship. There is none equal to thee, how can there be one greater? O<br>thou whose power is unparalleled in even three worlds?[256] Therefore<br>bowing (to thee) prostrating (my) body, I ask thy grace, O Lord, O<br>adorable one. It behoveth thee. O God, to bear (my faults) as a father<br>(his) son's, a friend (his) friend's, a lover (his) loved one's.<br>Beholding (thy) form (unseen) before, I have been joyful, (yet) my mind<br>hath been troubled, with fear. Show me that (other ordinary) form, O God.<br>Be gracious, O Lord of the gods, O thou that art the refuge of the<br>universe. (Decked) in diadem, and (armed) with mace, discus in hand, as<br>before, I desire to behold thee. Be of that same four-armed form, O thou<br>of a thousand arms, thou of universal form."<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'Pleased with thee, O Arjuna, I have, by my (own)<br>mystic power, shown thee this supreme form, full of glory, Universal,<br>Infinite, Primeval, which hath been seen before by none save thee. Except<br>by thee alone, hero of Kuru's race, I cannot be seen in this form in the<br>world of men by any one else, (aided) even by the study of the Vedas and<br>of sacrifices, by gifts, by actions, (or) by the severest<br>austerities.[257] Let no fear be thine, nor perplexity of mind at seeing<br>this awful form of mine. Freed from fear with a joyful heart, thou again<br>see Me assuming that other form.'"<br><br>Sanjaya continued,&#8212;"Vasudeva, having said all this to Arjuna, once more<br>showed (him) his own (ordinary) form, and that High-Souled one, assuming<br>once more (his) gentle form, comforted him who had been afflicted."<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'Beholding this gentle human form of thine, O Janardana, I<br>have now become of right mind and have come to my normal state.'<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'This form of mine which thou hast seen is difficult<br>of being seen. Even the gods are always desirous of becoming spectators<br>of this (my) form. Not by the Vedas, nor by austerities, nor by gifts,<br>nor by sacrifices, can I be seen in this form of mine which thou hast<br>seen. By reverence, however, that is exclusive (in its objects), O<br>Arjuna, I can in this form be known, seen truly, and attained to, O<br>chastiser of foes. He who doth everything for me, who hath me for his<br>supreme object, who is freed from attachment, who is without enmity<br>towards all beings, even he, O Arjuna, cometh to me.'
