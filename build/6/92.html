                            Dhritarashtra said, "Tell me, O Sanjaya, all that the mighty Partha did<br>in battle when they heard that Iravat had been slain."<br><br>Sanjaya said, "Beholding Iravat slain in battle, the Rakshasa<br>Ghatotkacha, the son of Bhimasena, uttered loud shouts. And in<br>consequence of the loudness of those roars, the earth having the ocean<br>for her robes, along with her mountains and forests, began to tremble<br>violently. And the welkin also and the quarters both cardinal and<br>subsidiary, all trembled. And hearing those loud roars of his, O Bharata,<br>the thighs and other limbs of the troops began to tremble, and sweat also<br>appeared on their persons. And all thy combatants, O king, became<br>cheerless of heart. And all over the field the warriors stood still, like<br>an elephant afraid of the lion. And the Rakshasa, uttering those loud<br>roars resembling the rattle of thunder, assuming a terrible form, and<br>with a blazing spear upraised in hand, and surrounded by many bulls among<br>Rakshasas of fierce forms armed with diverse weapons, advanced, excited<br>with rage and resembling the Destroyer himself at the end of the Yuga.<br>Beholding him advance in wrath and with a terrible countenance, and<br>seeing also his own troops almost all running away from fear of that<br>Rakshasa, king Duryodhana rushed against Ghatotkacha, taking up his bow<br>with arrow fixed on the string, and repeatedly roaring like a lion.<br>Behind him proceeded the ruler of the Vangas, with ten thousand<br>elephants, huge as hills, and each with juice trickling down. Beholding<br>thy son, O king, (thus) advancing surrounded by that elephant division,<br>that ranger of the night (viz., Ghatotkacha) was highly inflamed with<br>rage. Then commenced a battle with utmost vehemences that made the hair<br>stand on end, between the formidable Rakshasa and the troops of<br>Duryodhana. And beholding also that elephant division risen (on the<br>horizon) like a cloud, the Rakshasas, inflamed with rage, rushed towards<br>it, weapons in hand, and uttering diverse roars like clouds charged with<br>lightning. With arrows and darts and swords and long shafts, as also with<br>spears and mallets and battle-axes and short arrows, they began to smite<br>down that elephant host. And they slew huge elephants with<br>mountain-summits and large trees. While the Rakshasas slew those<br>elephants, O king, we saw that some of them had their frontal globes<br>smashed, some were bathed in blood, and some had their limbs broken or<br>cut through. At last when that elephant host was broken and thinned,<br>Duryodhana, O king, rushed upon the Rakshasas, under the influence of<br>rage and becoming reckless of his very life. And that mighty warrior sped<br>clouds of sharp shafts at the Rakshasas. And that great bowman slew many<br>of their foremost warriors. Inflamed with rage, O chief of the Bharatas,<br>that mighty car-warrior, viz., thy son Duryodhana, then slew with four<br>shafts four of the principal Rakshasas, viz., Vegavat, Maharudra,<br>Vidyujihva, and Pramathin. And once again, O chief of the Bharatas, that<br>warrior of immeasurable soul, sped at the Rakshasa host showers of arrows<br>that could with difficulty be resisted. Beholding that great feat of thy<br>son, O sire, the mighty son of Bhimasena blazed up with wrath. Drawing<br>his large bow effulgent as the lightning, he rushed impetuously at the<br>wrathful Duryodhana. Beholding him (thus) rushing like Death himself<br>commissioned by the Destroyer, thy son Duryodhana, O king, shook not at<br>all. With eyes red in anger, and excited with rage, Ghatotkacha, then,<br>addressing thy son, said, 'I shall today be freed from the debt I owe to<br>my sires, as also to my mother, they that had so long been exiled by thy<br>cruel self. The sons of Pandu, O king, were vanquished by thee in that<br>match at dice. Drupada's daughter Krishna also, while ill and, therefore,<br>clad in a single raiment, was brought into the assembly and great trouble<br>was given by thee in diverse ways, O thou most wicked, unto her. While<br>dwelling also in her sylvan retreat, thy well-wisher, that wicked wight,<br>viz., the ruler of the Sindhus, persecuted her further, disregarding my<br>sires. For these and other wrongs, O wretch of thy race, I shall today<br>take vengeance if thou dost not quit the field.' Having said these words,<br>Hidimva's son, drawing his gigantic bow, biting his (nether) lip with his<br>teeth, and licking the corners of his mouth, covered Duryodhana with a<br>profuse shower, like a mass of clouds covering the mountain-breast with<br>torrents of rain in the rainy season."
