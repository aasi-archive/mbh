                            Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;"When the Sun rose, O Sanjaya, of my army led by<br>Bhishma and the Pandava army led by Bhima, which first cheerfully<br>approached the other, desirous of fight? To which side were the Sun, the<br>Moon and the wind hostile, and against whom did the beasts of prey utter<br>inauspicious sounds? Who were those young men, the complexions of whose<br>faces were cheerful? Tell me all these truly and duly."<br><br>Sanjaya said,&#8212;"Both armies, when arrayed, were equally joyful, O king.<br>Both armies looked equally beautiful, assuming the aspect of blossoming<br>woods, and both armies were full of elephants, cars and horses. Both<br>armies were vast and terrible in aspect; and so also, O Bharata, none of<br>them could bear the other. Both of them were arrayed for conquering the<br>very heavens, and both of them consisted of excellent persons. The<br>Kauravas belonging to the Dhritarashtra party stood facing the west,<br>while the Parthas stood facing the east, addrest for fight. The troops of<br>the Kauravas looked like the army of the chief of the Danavas, while that<br>of the Pandavas looked like the army of the celestials. The wind began to<br>blow from behind the Pandavas (against the face of the Dhartarashtras),<br>and the beasts of prey began to yell against the Dhartarashtras. The<br>elephants belonging to thy sons could not bear the strong odour of the<br>temporal juice emitted by the huge elephants (of the Pandavas). And<br>Duryodhana rode on an elephant of the complexion of the lotus, with rent<br>temples, graced with a golden Kaksha (on its back), and cased in an<br>armour of steel net-work. And he was in the very centre of the Kurus and<br>was adored by eulogists and bards. And a white umbrella of lunar<br>effulgence was held over his head graced with a golden chain. Him Sakuni,<br>the ruler of the Gandharas, followed with mountaineers of Gandhara placed<br>all around. And the venerable Bhishma was at the head of all the troops,<br>with a white umbrella held over his head, armed with bow and sword, with<br>a white headgear, with a white banner (on his car), and with white steeds<br>(yoked thereto), and altogether looking like a white mountain. In<br>Bhishma's division were all the sons of Dhritarashtra, and also Sala who<br>was a countryman of the Valhikas, and also all those Kshatriyas called<br>Amvastas, and those called Sindhus, and those also that are called<br>Sauviras, and the heroic dwellers of the country of the five rivers. And<br>on a golden car unto which were yoked red steeds, the high-souled Drona,<br>bow in hand and with never-failing heart, the preceptor of almost all the<br>kings, remained behind all the troops, protecting them like Indra. And<br>Saradwat's son, that fighter in the van,[110] that high-souled and mighty<br>bowman, called also Gautama, conversant with all modes of warfare,<br>accompanied by the Sakas, the Kiratas, the Yavanas, and the Pahlavas,<br>took up his position at the northern point of the army. That large force<br>which was well protected by mighty car-warriors of the Vrishni and the<br>Bhoja races, as also by the warriors of Surashtra well-armed and<br>well-acquainted with the uses of weapons, and which was led by<br>Kritavarman, proceeded towards the south of the army. Ten thousand cars<br>of the Samasaptakas who were created for either the death or the fame of<br>Arjuna, and who, accomplished in arms, intended to follow Arjuna at his<br>heels[111] all went out as also the brave Trigartas. In thy army, O<br>Bharata, were a thousand elephants of the foremost fighting powers. Unto<br>each elephant was assigned a century of cars; unto each car, a hundred<br>horsemen; unto each horseman, ten bowmen; and unto each bowman ten<br>combatants armed with sword and shield. Thus, O Bharata, were thy<br>divisions arrayed by Bhishma. Thy generalissimo Bhishma, the son of<br>Santanu, as each day dawned, sometimes disposed thy troops in the human<br>army, sometimes in the celestial, sometimes in the Gandharva, and<br>sometimes in the Asura. Thronged with a large number of Maharathas, and<br>roaring like the very ocean, the Dhartarashtra army, arrayed by Bhishma,<br>stood facing the west for battle. Illimitable as thy army was, O ruler of<br>men, it looked terrible; but the army of the Pandavas, although it was<br>not such (in number), yet seemed to me to be very large and invincible<br>since Kesava and Arjuna were its leader."
