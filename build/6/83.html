                            Sanjaya said, "And when the battle was thus raging and after Susarman had<br>ceased fighting, and the (other) heroic warriors (of the Kuru army) had<br>been routed by the high-souled son of Pandu; after, indeed, thy army,<br>resembling the very ocean, had become quickly agitated and the son of<br>Ganga had speedily proceeded against the car of Vijaya, king Duryodhana,<br>beholding the prowess of Partha in battle, quickly proceeded towards<br>those kings, and addressing them as also the heroic and mighty Susarman<br>stationed in their van, said in their midst these words, gladdening them<br>all, 'This Bhishma, the son of Santanu, this foremost one among the<br>Kurus, reckless of his very life, is desirous of fighting with his whole<br>soul against Dhananjaya. Exerting your best, ye all, united together, and<br>accompanied by your troops, protect in battle the grandsire, of Bharata's<br>race, who is proceeding against the hostile army.' Saying, 'Yes,' all<br>those divisions, belonging to those kings, O monarch, proceeded,<br>following the grandsire. Then the mighty Bhishma, the son of Santanu,<br>(thus rushing to battle), speedily came upon Arjuna of Bharata's race who<br>also had been coming towards him, on his exceedingly resplendent and<br>large car unto which were yoked white steeds and upon which was set up<br>his standard bearing the fierce ape, and whose rattle resembled the deep<br>roll of the clouds. And thy entire army, beholding the diadem-decked<br>Dhananjaya, thus coming to battle, uttered, from fear, many loud<br>exclamations. And beholding Krishna, reins in hand, and looking like the<br>mid-day sun in splendour, thy troops could not gaze at him. And so also<br>the Pandavas were incapable of looking at Santanu's son Bhishma of white<br>steeds and white bow and resembling the planet Sukra risen in the<br>firmament. And the latter was surrounded on all sides by the high-souled<br>warriors of the Trigartas headed by their king with his brothers and<br>sons, and by many other mighty car-warriors.<br><br>"Meanwhile, Bharadwaja's son pierced with his winged arrows the king of<br>the Matsyas in battle. And in that combat he cut off the latter's<br>standard with one shaft, and his bow also with another. Then Virata, the<br>commander of a large division, leaving aside that bow thus cut off,<br>quickly took up another that was strong and capable of bearing a great<br>strain. And he also took up a number of blazing arrows that resembled<br>snakes of virulent poison. And he pierced Drona in return with three (of<br>these) and his (four) steeds with four. And then he pierced Drona's<br>standard with one arrow, and his charioteer with five. And he also<br>pierced Drona's bow with one arrow, and (at all this) that bull among<br>Brahmanas became highly angry. Then Drona slew Virata's steeds with eight<br>straight shafts, and then his charioteer, O chief of the Bharatas, with<br>one shaft. His charioteer having been slain, Virata jumped down from his<br>car whose steeds also had been killed. And then that foremost of<br>car-warriors speedily mounted upon the car of (his son) Sankha. Then sire<br>and son, staying on the same car, began with great might to resist the<br>son of Bharadwaja with a thick shower of arrows. Then the mighty son of<br>Bharadwaja, excited with wrath, quickly shot at Sankha in that encounter,<br>an arrow resembling a snake of virulent poison. And that arrow, piercing<br>through Sankha's breast and drinking his blood, fell upon the earth, wet<br>and smeared with gore. Struck with that arrow of Bharadwaja's son, Sankha<br>speedily fell down from his car, his bow and arrows loosened from his<br>grasp in the very presence of his sire. And beholding his son slain,<br>Virata fled from fear, avoiding Drona in battle, who resembled Death's<br>self with gasping mouth. The son of Bharadwaja then, without losing a<br>moment, checked the mighty host of the Pandavas resisting combatants by<br>hundreds and thousands.<br><br>"Sikhandin also, O king, getting at Drona's son in that battle, struck<br>the latter between his brows with three swiftly coursing shafts. And that<br>tiger among men, viz., Aswatthaman, pierced with those shafts looked<br>beautiful like the mountain Meru with its three tall golden crests. Then,<br>O king, Aswatthaman excited with rage, and within half the time taken up<br>by a wink of the eye, overthrew in that battle Sikhandin's charioteer and<br>standard and steeds and weapons, covering them with myriads of shafts.<br>Then that foremost of car-warriors, viz., Sikhandin, that scorcher of<br>foes, jumping down from that car whose steeds had been slain, and taking<br>up a sharp and polished scimitar and a shield, excited with rage, moved<br>on the field with great activity like a hawk. And while moving with great<br>activity, O king, on the field sword in hand, the son of Drona failed to<br>find an opportunity (for striking him). And all this seemed highly<br>wonderful. And then, O bull of Bharata's race, the highly wrathful son of<br>Drona sent after Sikhandin in that battle many thousands of shafts. But<br>Sikhandin, that foremost of mighty men, with his sharp sword cut that<br>fierce shower of arrows coming towards him. Then the son of Drona cut<br>into pieces that resplendent and beautiful shield decked with a hundred<br>moons and then that sword also of Sikhandin. And he pierced the latter's<br>person also, O king, with a large number of winged arrows. Then<br>Sikhandin, whirling the fragment (in his hand) of that sword of his which<br>had been cut off by Aswatthaman with his arrows and which resembled a<br>blazing snake, quickly hurled it at him. The son of Drona however,<br>displaying in that battle the lightness of his arms, cut off that (broken<br>blade) coming impetuously towards him and resembling in splendour the<br>fire that blazeth forth at the end of the Yuga. And he pierced Sikhandin<br>himself with innumerable arrows made of iron. Then Sikhandin, O King,<br>exceedingly afflicted with those whetted arrows, speedily mounted on the<br>car of (Satyaki) that high-souled scion of Madhu's race. Then Satyaki,<br>excited with rage, pierced in that battle, with his terrible shafts the<br>cruel Rakshasa Alamvusha on all sides. That prince of Rakshasas then, O<br>Bharata, cut off in that combat Satyaki's bow with a crescent-shaped<br>arrow and pierced Satyaki also with many shafts. And creating by his<br>Rakshasa powers an illusion, he covered Satyaki with showers of arrows.<br>But wonderful was the prowess that we then beheld of the grandson of<br>Sini, inasmuch as struck with those whetted shafts he betrayed no fear.<br>On the other hand, O Bharata, that son of Vrishni's race applied (with<br>Mantras) the Aindra weapon, which that illustrious hero of Madhu's race<br>had obtained from Vijaya.[413] That weapon, consuming into ashes that<br>Demoniac illusion, covered Alamvusha all over with terrible shafts, like<br>a mass of clouds covering the mountain-breast with torrents of rain in<br>the rainy season. Thereupon the Rakshasa, thus afflicted by that hero of<br>Madhu's race, fled away in fear, avoiding Satyaki in battle. Then the<br>grandson of Sini, having vanquished that prince of Rakshasas who was<br>incapable of being vanquished by Maghavat himself, uttered a loud roar in<br>the very sight of all thy troops. And Satyaki, of prowess incapable of<br>being baffled, then began to slay thy troops with innumerable shafts<br>whereupon the latter fled away in fear.<br><br>"Meanwhile, O monarch, Dhrishtadyumna, the mighty son of Drupada, covered<br>thy royal son in battle with innumerable straight shafts. While, however,<br>O Bharata, Dhrishtadyumna was thus shrouding him with his shafts, thy<br>royal son was neither agitated nor struck with fear. On the other hand,<br>he speedily pierced Dhrishtadyumna in that battle (first) with sixty and<br>(then) with thirty shafts. And all these seemed highly wonderful. Then<br>the commander of the Pandava army, O Bharata, excited with wrath cut off<br>his bow. And that mighty car-warrior then slew in that combat the four<br>steeds of thy son, and also pierced him with seven shafts of the keenest<br>points. Thereupon (thy son), that mighty-armed warrior endued with great<br>strength, jumping down from that car whose steeds had been slain, ran on<br>foot, with an upraised sabre, towards the son of Prishata. Then the<br>mighty Sakuni, devoted to the king, quickly coming to that spot, caused<br>thy royal son to mount on his own car in the very sight of all. Then that<br>slayer of foes, the son of Prishata, having vanquished the king, began to<br>slaughter thy troops like the wielder of the thunder-bolt slaughtering<br>the Asuras.<br><br>"Kritavarman, in that battle, covered with his arrows that mighty<br>car-warrior Bhima. Indeed, he overwhelmed the latter entirely, like a<br>mighty mass of clouds shrouding the sun. Then that chastiser of foes<br>viz., Bhimasena, excited with wrath, and laughing the while, sped some<br>shafts at Kritavarman. Struck therewith, that Atiratha of the Satwata<br>race, excelling all in might, trembled not, O king, but (instead) pierced<br>Bhima (in return) with many sharp arrows. Then the mighty Bhimasena,<br>slaying the four steeds of Kritavarman, felled the latter's charioteer,<br>and then his beautiful standard. And that slayer of hostile heroes (viz.,<br>Bhima) then pierced Kritavarman himself with many shafts of diverse<br>kinds. And Kritavarman, pierced all over, seemed to be excessively<br>mangled in every limb. Then from that car whose steeds had been slain,<br>Kritavarman quickly went to the car of Vrishaka, in the very sight, O<br>king, of both Salya and thy son. And Bhimasena. excited with rage, began<br>to afflict thy troops. Goaded to fury, he began to slay them, like the<br>destroyer himself armed with his club."
