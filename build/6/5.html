                            "Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;'The names of rivers and mountains, O Sanjaya, as<br>also of provinces, and all other things resting on the earth, and their<br>dimensions, O thou that are acquainted with the measures of things of the<br>earth in its entirety and the forests, O Sanjaya, recount to me in<br>detail.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said,&#8212;'O great king, all things in the universe, in consequence<br>of the presence (in them) of the five elements, have been said to be<br>equal by the wise. These elements, are space, air, fire, water, and<br>earth. Their (respective) attributes are sound, touch, vision, taste, and<br>scent. Every one of these elements possesses (in addition to what is<br>especially its own) the attribute or attributes of that or those coming<br>before it. The earth, therefore, is the foremost of them all, possessing<br>as it does the attributes of all the other four, besides what is<br>specially its own, as said by Rishis acquainted with truth.[32] There are<br>four attributes, O king, in water. Scent does not exist in it. Fire has<br>three attributes viz., sound, touch, and vision. Sound and touch belong<br>to air, while space has sound alone. These five attributes, O king, exist<br>(in this way) in the five principal elements depending on which all<br>creatures in the universe exist. They exist separately and independently<br>when there is homogeneity in the universe.[33] When, however, these do<br>not exist in their natural state but with one another, then creatures<br>spring into life, furnished with bodies. This is never otherwise. The<br>elements are destroyed, in the order of the one succeeding, merging into<br>the one that proceeds; and they spring also into existence, one arising<br>from the one before it.[34] All of these are immeasurable, their forms<br>being Brahma itself. In the universe are seen creatures consisting of the<br>five elements. Men endeavour to ascertain their proportions by exercising<br>their reason. Those matters, however, that are inconceivable, should<br>never be sought to be solved by reason. That which is above (human)<br>nature is an indication of the inconceivable.<br><br>"'O son of Kuru's race, I will, however, describe to thee the island<br>called Sudarsana. This island, O king, is circular and of the form of a<br>wheel. It is covered with rivers and other pieces of water and with<br>mountains looking like masses of clouds, and with cities and many<br>delightful provinces. It is also full of trees furnished with flowers and<br>fruits, and with crops of diverse kinds and other wealth. And it is<br>surrounded on all sides with the salt ocean. As a person can see his own<br>face in a mirror, even so is the island called Sudarsana seen in the<br>lunar disc. Two of its parts seem to be a peepul tree, while two others<br>look like a large hare. It is surrounded on all sides with an assemblage<br>of every kind of deciduous plants. Besides these portions, the rest is<br>all water. What remains I will describe to thee shortly. The rest I will<br>speak of afterwards. Listen now to this that I describe in brief.[35]"
