                            Sanjaya said, "Then Bhishma, the son of Santanu, went out with the<br>troops. And he disposed his own troops in mighty array called<br>Sarvatobhadra.[463] Kripa, and Kritavarman, and that mighty car-warrior<br>Saivya, and Sakuni, and the ruler of the Sindhus, and Sudakshina the<br>ruler of the Kamvojas, these all, together with Bhishma and thy sons, O<br>Bharata, took up their stations in the van of the whole army and in the<br>very front of the (Kaurava) array. Drona and Bhurisravas and Salya and<br>Bhagadatta, O sire, clad in mail, took up their position in the right<br>wing of that array. And Aswatthaman, and Somadatta, and those great<br>car-warriors, viz., the two princes of Avanti, accompanied by a large<br>force, protected the left wing. Duryodhana, O monarch, surrounded on all<br>sides by the Trigartas, took up, for encountering the Pandavas, a<br>position in the midst of that array. That foremost of car-warriors, viz.,<br>Alamvusha, and that mighty car-warrior, viz., Srutayush, clad in mail,<br>took up their position in the rear of that array, and therefore, of the<br>whole army. Having, O Bharata, on that occasion formed their array thus,<br>thy warriors, clad in mail, looked like scorching fires.<br><br>"Then king Yudhishthira, and that son of Pandu, viz., Bhimasena, and the<br>twin sons of Madri, viz., Nakula and Sahadeva, clad in mail, took up<br>their position in the van of that array and therefore, at the very head<br>of all their troops. And Dhrishtadyumna, and Virata, and that mighty<br>car-warrior, viz., Satyaki,&#8212;these destroyers of hostile ranks,&#8212;stood,<br>supported by a large force. And Sikhandin, and Vijaya (Arjuna), and the<br>Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, and Chekitana of mighty arms, and the valiant<br>Kuntibhoja, stood for battle, surrounded by a large force. And that great<br>bowman Abhimanyu, and the mighty Drupada, and the (five) Kaikeya<br>brothers, stood for battle, clad in mail. Having formed their mighty and<br>invincible array thus, the Pandavas, endued with great courage in battle,<br>stood for the fight, clad in mail.<br><br>"Then the kings of thy array, O monarch, exerting themselves at their<br>best, accompanied by their forces, and placing Bhishma at their van,<br>rushed against the Parthas in battle. Similarly the Pandavas also, O<br>king, headed by Bhimasena, and desirous of victory in battle proceeded,<br>for battling with Bhishma. With leonine roars and confused cries, blowing<br>their conches Krakachas, and cow-horns, beating their drums and cymbals<br>and Pandavas in thousands.[464] And uttering terrible shouts, the<br>Pandavas advanced to battle. With the din of our drums and cymbals and<br>conches and smaller drums, with loud leonine roars, and other kinds of<br>shouts, ourselves also, replying to the cries of the foe, rushed against<br>him with great impetuosity, inflamed with rage. Those sounds mingling<br>with one another, produced a tremendous uproar. The warriors then, of the<br>two armies, rushing at one another, began to strike. And in consequence<br>of the din produced by that encounter, the earth seemed to tremble. And<br>birds, uttering fierce cries, hovered in the air. The Sun, radiant as he<br>was when he had risen, became dimmed. And fierce winds blew, indicating<br>great terrors. Frightful jackals wandered, yelling terribly, O king, and<br>foreboding an awful carnage at hand. The quarters seemed, O king, to be<br>ablaze, and showers of dust fell from the blue. And a shower fell there,<br>of pieces of bones mixed with blood. And tears fell from the eyes of the<br>animals which were all weeping. And filled with anxiety, O king, these<br>began to urinate and eject the contents of their stomachs. And the loud<br>shouts of battle, O bull of Bharata's race, were rendered inaudible by<br>the louder cries of Rakshasas and cannibals. And jackals and vultures and<br>crows and dogs, uttering diverse kinds of cries, began, O sire, to fall<br>and swoop down on the field. And blazing meteors, striking against the<br>Sun's disc, fell with great celerity on the earth, foreboding great<br>terrors. Then those two vast hosts belonging to the Pandavas and the<br>Dhartarashtras, in course of that awful encounter, shook in consequence<br>of that tremendous uproar of conches and drums like forests shaken by the<br>tempest. And the noise made by the two armies, both of which abounded<br>with kings, elephants, and steeds, and which encountered each other in an<br>evil hour, resembled the noise made by oceans tossed by the tempest."
