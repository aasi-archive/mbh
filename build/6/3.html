                            "Vyasa said,&#8212;'Asses are taking births in kine. Some are having sexual<br>pleasure with mothers. The trees in the forests are exhibiting<br>unseasonable flowers and fruits. Women quick with child, and even those<br>that are not so, are giving birth to monsters. Carnivorous beasts,<br>mingling with (carnivorous) birds, are feeding together. Ill-omened<br>beasts, some having three horns, some with four eyes, some with five<br>legs, some with two sexual organs, some with two heads, some with two<br>tails, some having fierce teeth, are being born, and with mouths wide<br>open are uttering unholy cries. Horses with three legs, furnished with<br>crests, having four teeth, and endued with horns, are also being born. O<br>king! in thy city is also seen that the wives of many utterers of Brahma<br>are bringing forth Garudas and peacocks. The mare is bringing forth the<br>cow-calf and the bitch is bringing forth, O king, jackals and cocks, and<br>antelopes and parrots are all uttering inauspicious cries.[12] Certain<br>women are bringing forth four or five daughters (at a time), and these as<br>soon as they are born, dance and sing and laugh. The members of the<br>lowest orders are laughing and dancing and singing, and thus indicating<br>direful consequences. Infants, as if urged by death, are drawing armed<br>images, and are running against one another, armed with clubs, and<br>desirous of battle are also breaking down the towns (they erect in<br>sport). Lotuses of different kinds and lilies are growing on trees.<br>Strong winds are blowing fiercely and the dust ceaseth not. The earth is<br>frequently trembling, and Rahu approacheth towards the sun. The white<br>planet (Ketu) stayeth, having passed beyond the constellation Chitra. All<br>this particularly bodeth the destruction of the Kurus. A fierce comet<br>riseth, afflicting the constellation Pusya. This great planet will cause<br>frightful mischief to both the armies. Mars wheeleth towards Magha and<br>Vrihaspati (Jupiter) towards Sravana. The Sun's offspring (Sani)<br>approaching towards the constellation Bhaga, afflicteth it. The planet<br>Sukra, ascending towards Purva Bhadra, shineth brilliantly, and wheeling<br>towards the Uttara Bhadra, looketh towards it, having effected a junction<br>(with a smaller planet). The white planet (Ketu), blazing up like fire<br>mixed with smoke, stayeth, having attacked the bright constellation<br>Jeshtha that is sacred to Indra. The constellation Dhruva, blazing<br>fiercely, wheeleth towards the right. Both the Moon and the Sun are<br>afflicting Rohini. The fierce planet (Rahu) hath taken up its position<br>between the constellations Chitra and Swati.[13] The red-bodied (Mars)<br>possessed of the effulgence of fire, wheeling circuitously, stayeth in a<br>line with the constellation Sravana over-ridden by Vrihaspati. The earth<br>that produceth particular crops at particular seasons is now covered with<br>the crops of every season.[14] Every barley-stalk is graced with five<br>ears, and every paddy-stalk with a hundred. They that are the best of<br>creatures in the worlds and upon whom depends the universe, viz., kine,<br>when milked after the calves have their suck, yield only blood. Radiant<br>rays of light emanate from bows, and swords blaze forth brilliantly. It<br>is evident that the weapons behold (before them) the battle, as if it<br>were already arrived. The hue of weapons and the water, as also of coats<br>of mail and standards, is like that of fire. A great slaughter will take<br>place. In this battle,[15] O Bharata, of the Kurus with the Pandavas, the<br>earth, O monarch, will be a river of blood with the standards (of<br>warriors) as its rafts. Animals and birds on all sides, with mouths<br>blazing like fire, uttering fierce cries, and displaying these evil<br>omens, are foreboding terrible consequences. A (fierce) bird with but one<br>wing, one eye, and one leg, hovering over the sky in the night, screameth<br>frightfully in wrath, as if for making the hearers vomit blood? It<br>seemeth, O great king, that all weapons are now blazing with radiance.<br>The effulgence of the constellation known by the name of the seven<br>high-souled Rishis, hath been dimmed. Those two blazing planets, viz.,<br>Vrihaspati and Sani, having approached the constellation called Visakha,<br>have become stationary there for a whole year. Three lunations twice<br>meeting together in course of the same lunar fortnight, the duration of<br>the latter is shortened by two days.[16] On the thirteenth day therefore,<br>from the first lunation, according as it is the day of the full moon or<br>the new moon, the moon and the sun are afflicted by Rahu. Such strange<br>eclipses, both lunar and solar, forebode a great slaughter.[17] All the<br>quarters of the earth, being overwhelmed by showers of dust, look<br>inauspicious. Fierce clouds, portentous of danger, drop bloody showers<br>during the night. Rahu of fierce deeds is also, O monarch, afflicting the<br>constellation Kirtika. Rough winds, portending fierce danger, are<br>constantly blowing. All these beget a war characterised by many sad<br>incidents.[18] The constellations are divided into three classes. Upon<br>one or another of each class, a planet of evil omen has shed its<br>influence, foreboding terrible dangers.[19] A lunar fortnight had<br>hitherto consisted of fourteen days, or fifteen days (as usual), or<br>sixteen days. This, however, I never knew that the day of new-moon would<br>be on the thirteenth day from the first lunation, or the day of full-moon<br>on the thirteenth day from the same. And yet in course of the same month<br>both the Moon and the Sun have undergone eclipses on the thirteenth days<br>from the day of the first lunation.[20] The Sun and the Moon therefore,<br>by undergoing eclipses on unusual days,[21] will cause a great slaughter<br>of the creatures of the earth. Indeed, Rakshasas, though drinking blood<br>by mouthful, will yet not be satiated. The great rivers are flowing in<br>opposite directions. The waters of rivers have become bloody. The wells,<br>foaming up, are bellowing like bulls.[22] Meteors, effulgent like Indra's<br>thunder-bolt, fall with loud hisses.[23] When this night passeth away,<br>evil consequences will overtake you. People, for meeting together, coming<br>out of their houses with lighted brands, have still to encounter a thick<br>gloom all round.[24] Great Rishis have said that in view of such<br>circumstances the earth drinks the blood of thousands of kings. From the<br>mountains of Kailasa and Mandara and Himavat thousands of explosions are<br>heard and thousands of summits are tumbling down. In consequence of the<br>Earth's trembling, each of the four oceans having swelled greatly, seems<br>ready to transgress its continents for afflicting the Earth.[25] Fierce<br>winds charged with pointed pebbles are blowing, crushing mighty trees. In<br>villages and towns trees, ordinary and sacred, are falling down, crushed<br>by mighty winds and struck by lightning. The (sacrificial) fire, when<br>Brahmanas pour libations on it, becomes blue, or red, or yellow. Its<br>flames bend towards the left, yielding a bad scent, accompanied by loud<br>reports. Touch, smell, and taste have, O monarch, become what they were<br>not. The standards (of warriors), repeatedly trembling are emitting<br>smoke. Drums and cymbals are throwing off showers of coal-dust. And from<br>the tops of tall trees all around, crows, wheeling in circles from the<br>left, are uttering fierce cries. All of them again are uttering frightful<br>cries of pakka, pakka and are perching upon the tops of standards for the<br>destruction of the kings. Vicious elephants, trembling all over, are<br>running hither and thither, urinating and ejecting excreta. The horses<br>are all melancholy, while the elephants are resorting to the water.<br>Hearing all this, let that be done which is suitable, so that, O Bharata,<br>the world may not be depopulated.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Hearing these words of his father,<br>Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;'I think all this hath been ordained of old. A great<br>slaughter of human beings will take place. If the kings die in battle<br>observing the duties of the Kshatriya order, they will then, attaining to<br>the regions reserved for heroes, obtain only happiness. These tigers<br>among men, casting away their lives in great battle, will win fame in<br>this and great bliss for ever in the next world.'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"O best of kings, thus addressed by his son<br>Dhritarashtra, that prince of poets, the Muni (Vyasa) concentrated his<br>mind in supreme Yoga. Having contemplated for only a short space of time,<br>Vyasa once more said,&#8212;'Without doubt, O king of kings, it is Time that<br>destroyeth the universe. It is Time also that createth the worlds. There<br>is nothing here that is eternal. Show the path of righteousness to the<br>Kurus, to thy kinsmen, relatives, and friends. Thou art competent to<br>restrain them. The slaughter of kinsmen hath been said to be sinful. Do<br>not do that which is disagreeable to me. O king, Death himself hath been<br>born in the shape of thy son. Slaughter is never applauded in the Vedas.<br>It can never be beneficial. The usages of one's race are as one's own<br>body. Those usages slay him that destroyeth them. For the destruction of<br>this race and of those kings of the earth it is Time that maketh thee<br>deviate into the wrong path like one in distress, although thou art<br>competent (to walk along the path of righteousness). O king, in the shape<br>of thy kingdom hath calamity come to thee. Thy virtue is sustaining a<br>very great diminution.[26] Show what righteousness is unto thy sons. O<br>thou that art invincible, of what value is that kingdom to thee which<br>bringeth sin to thee? Take care of thy good name, thy virtue, and thy<br>fame. Thou wilt then win heaven. Let the Pandavas have their kingdom, and<br>let the Kauravas have peace."<br><br>"While that best of Brahmanas was saying these words in a sorrowful tone,<br>Dhritarashtra, the son of Ambika, accomplished in speech, once more<br>addressed him, saying.&#8212;-'My knowledge of life and death is similar to<br>thine. The truth is known to me as regards these. Man, however, in what<br>concerns his own interests, is deprived of judgment. O sire, know me to<br>be one who is an ordinary person. Of immeasurable power thou art. I pray<br>thee to extend thine towards us. Of soul under complete control, thou art<br>our refuge and instructor. My sons are not obedient to me, O great Rishi.<br>My understanding too is not inclined to commit sin.[27] Thou art the<br>cause of the fame, the achievements, and the inclination for virtue, of<br>the Bharatas. Thou art the reverend grandsire of both the Kurus and the<br>Pandavas.'<br><br>"Vyasa said,&#8212;'O royal son of Vichitravirya, tell me freely what is in<br>thy mind. I will remove thy doubts."<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;'O holy one, I desire to hear from thee of all<br>those indications that happen unto those that become victorious in<br>battle."<br><br>"Vyasa said,&#8212;'The (sacred) fire assumes a cheerful radiance. Its light<br>ascends upwards. Its flame bends towards the right. It blazes up without<br>being smoky. The libations poured on it yield a fragrant scent. It is<br>said that these are the indications of future success. The conches and<br>cymbals yield sounds that are deep and loud. The Sun as well as the Moon<br>gives pure rays. It is said that these are the indications of future<br>success. Crows, whether stationary or on their wings, utter cries that<br>are agreeable. They again that are behind, urge the warriors to advance;<br>while they that are ahead, forbid all advance.[28] Where vultures, swans,<br>parrots, cranes, and wood-peckers utter delightful cries, and wheel<br>towards the right, the Brahmanas say that their victory in battle is<br>certain. They whose divisions, in consequence of ornaments, coats of<br>mail, and standards, or the melodious neigh of their steeds, become<br>resplendent and incapable of being gazed at, always conquer their foes.<br>They who utter cheerful shouts, those warriors, O Bharata, whose energies<br>are not damped and whose garlands do not fade, always cross the ocean of<br>battle. They who utter cheerful shouts having penetrated into the<br>divisions of the foe, who utter even kind words,[29] to the enemy, and<br>who, before striking, forewarn the foe, win victory. The objects of<br>hearing, vision, taste, touch, and smell, without undergoing any change<br>for the worse, become auspicious. This also is another indication of a<br>victorious army, viz., there is joy among the combatants at all time.<br>This also is another indication of success, viz. the winds that blow, the<br>clouds, and the birds, all become favourable; while the clouds (so<br>favourable) and the rain-bows drop beneficial showers. These, O king, are<br>the indications of armies to be crowned with victory, while O monarch,<br>all these become otherwise in the case of those that are about to be<br>destroyed. Whether the army be small or large, cheerfulness, as an<br>attribute of the combatants, is said to be a certain indication of<br>victory. One soldier, struck with panic, can cause even a large army to<br>take fright and fly. And when an army, struck with panic, takes to<br>flight, it causes even heroic warriors to take fright. If a large army is<br>once broken and put to rout, it cannot like a herd of deer disordered in<br>fright or a mighty current of water be easily checked. If a large army is<br>once routed, it is incapable of being rallied; on the other hand,<br>beholding it broken, even those well-skilled in battle, O Bharata, become<br>heartless. Beholding soldiers struck with fear and flying, the panic<br>spreads in other directions, and soon, O king, the whole army is broken<br>and flies in all directions. And when an army is routed, even brave<br>leaders, O king, at the head of large divisions consisting of the four<br>kinds of forces, are incapable of rallying them. An intelligent man,<br>always exerting himself with activity, should strive (to win success) by<br>the aid of means. It is said that that success which is won by<br>negotiation and other means is the very best. That which is achieved by<br>producing disunion (among the foe) is indifferent. While that success, O<br>king, which is won by battle, is the worst. In battle are many evils, the<br>initial one, as it is said, being slaughter. Even fifty brave men who<br>know one another, who are underpressed, who are free from family ties,<br>and who are firmly resolved, can crush a large army. Even five, six,<br>seven men, who are unretreating, win victory. Vinata's son Garuda, O<br>Bharata, beholding even a large concourse of birds, asketh not the aid of<br>many followers (to vanquish them). The strength in number, therefore of<br>an army is not always the cause of victory. Victory is uncertain. It<br>depends on chance. Even they that become victorious have to sustain<br>loss.'"
