                            Sanjaya said, "When that elephant division was exterminated, thy son<br>Duryodhana urged his entire army, commanding the warriors to slay<br>Bhimasena. Then the entire army at the command of thy son, rushed towards<br>Bhimasena who was uttering fierce shouts. That vast and unlimited host<br>difficult of being borne by the very gods, incapable of being crossed<br>like the surging sea on the day of full moon or new moon, abounding with<br>cars, elephants, and steeds, resounding with the blare of conches and the<br>beat of drums, numbering untold foot-soldiers and car-warriors, and<br>shrouded by the dust (raised), that very sea of hostile troops incapable<br>of being agitated, thus coming towards him, Bhimasena checked in battle,<br>O king, like the bank resisting the ocean. That feat, O king, which we<br>beheld, of Bhimasena the high-souled son of Pandu, was exceedingly<br>wonderful and superhuman. With his mace, he fearlessly checked all those<br>kings angrily rushing towards him, with their steeds and cars, and<br>elephants. Checking that vast force with mace, that foremost of mighty<br>men, Bhima, stood in that fierce melee, immovable as the mountain Meru.<br>And in that dreadful, fierce, and terrific encounter his brother and sons<br>and Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race, and the sons of Draupadi and<br>Abhimanyu, and the unvanquished Sikhandin&#8212;these mighty warriors,&#8212;did<br>not abandon him from fear. Taking up his massive and weighty mace made of<br>Saika iron, he rushed towards the warriors of thy army like the Destroyer<br>himself, armed with his club. And pressing crowds of cars and crowds of<br>horsemen down into the earth, Bhima wandered over the field like the fire<br>at the end of the Yuga. And Pandu's son of infinite prowess crushing<br>crowds of cars with the impetus of his thighs and slaying thy warriors in<br>battle, wandered like the Destroyer himself at the end of the Yuga. And<br>he began to grind thy troops with the greatest ease like an elephant<br>crushing a forest of reeds. And dragging car-warriors down from their<br>cars, and warriors fighting from the backs of heroes, and foot soldiers<br>as they stood on the ground, in the army of thy son, the mighty-armed<br>Bhimasena slew them all with his mace like the wind crushing trees by its<br>force. And that mace of his, slaying elephants and steeds, became smeared<br>with fat, marrow, flesh, and blood, and looked exceedingly terrible. And<br>with the bodies of slain men and cavalry lying scattered about, the field<br>of battle wore the appearance of the abode of Yama. And the terrible and<br>slaughtering mace of Bhimasena, resembling the fierce bludgeon of Death<br>and endued with the effulgence of Indra's bolt, looked like Pinaka of the<br>angry Rudra while destroying living creatures. Indeed, that mace of the<br>high-souled son of Kunti, who was slaying all around, looked fiercely<br>resplendent like the bludgeon of the Destroyer himself at the time of the<br>universal dissolution. And beholding him thus routing that large army<br>repeatedly and advancing like Death's self, all the warriors became<br>cheerless. Withersoever the son of Pandu, raising his mace, cast his<br>eyes, in consequence of his look alone, O Bharata, all the troops there<br>seemed to melt away. Beholding Vrikodara of terrible deeds, thus routing<br>the army and unvanquished by even so large a force and devouring the<br>(hostile) division like the Destroyer himself with wide-open mouth,<br>Bhimasena speedily came towards him, on his car of solar effulgence and<br>rattle loud as that of the clouds, (shrouding the welkin) with his arrowy<br>showers like a vapoury canopy charged with rain. Then the mighty-armed<br>Bhimasena, beholding Bhishma thus advancing like the Destroyer himself<br>with wide-open mouth, rushed towards him, excited with wrath. At that<br>moment, that foremost hero of Sini's race viz., Satyaki of sure aim, fell<br>upon the grandsire, slaying his enemies (along the way) with his firm bow<br>and causing thy son's army to tremble. And all the combatants who<br>belonged to thy army were then, O Bharata, unable to impede the progress<br>of that hero thus advancing with his steeds of silvery hue and scattering<br>his sharp shafts furnished with handsome wings. At that time the Rakshasa<br>Alamvusha (only) succeeded in piercing him with ten shafts. But piercing<br>Alamvusha in return with four shafts, the grandson of Sini proceeded on<br>his car. Beholding that hero of Vrishni's race thus advancing and rolling<br>(as it were) through the very midst of his enemies, and checking (as he<br>proceeded) the foremost of Kuru warriors, and repeatedly uttering loud<br>shouts in that battle, thy warriors then like masses of clouds pouring<br>rain in torrents on the mountain breast, showered their arrowy downpours<br>on him. They were, however, incapable of impeding the progress of that<br>hero who looked like the noon-day sun in his glory. And there was none<br>who was not then cheerless, save Somadatta's son, O king, and<br>Bhurisravas, the son of Somadatta, O Bharata, beholding the car-warriors<br>of his own side driven away, rushed against Satyaki from desire of<br>battle, taking up his bow of fierce impetus."
