                            "Duryodhana said, 'In all the worlds Vasudeva is spoken of as the Supreme<br>Being. I desire, O Grandsire, to know his origin and glory."<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Vasudeva is the Supreme Being. He is the God of all Gods.<br>None superior to him of eyes like lotus-petals is to be seen, O bull of<br>Bharata's race. Markandeya speaketh of Govinda as the Most Wonderful and<br>the Most high, as the All-being, as the All-soul, as the Highest soul,<br>and as the Supreme male Being. Water, Air, and Fire,&#8212;these three were<br>created by Him. That Divine Master and Lord of all the worlds created<br>this Earth. That Supreme Being of illustrious soul laid himself down on<br>the waters. And that Divine Being made up of all kinds of energy slept<br>thereon in Yoga. From his mouth He created Fire, and from his breath, the<br>Wind. Of unfading glory, He created from his mouth Speech and the Vedas.<br>It was thus that he created first the Worlds and also the gods along with<br>the diverse classes of Rishis. And he created decay and death also of all<br>creatures, as well as birth and growth. He is Righteousness and of<br>righteous soul. He is the giver of boons and the giver of all (our)<br>wishes. He is the Actor and Action, and He is himself the Divine<br>Master.[387] He first made the Past, the Present, and the Future; He is<br>the Creator of the Universe. He is of illustrious soul; He is the Master<br>possessed of unfading glory. He created Sankarshana, the First-born of<br>all creatures. He created the divine Sesha who is known as Ananta and who<br>upholdeth all creatures and the Earth with her mountains. Of Supreme<br>Energy, He it is whom the regenerate ones know by Yoga meditation. Sprung<br>from the secretions of his ear, the great Asura known by the name of<br>Madhu, fierce and of fierce deeds and entertaining a fierce intent and<br>about to destroy Brahman, was slain by that Supreme Being. And O sire, in<br>consequence of Madhu's slaughter, the gods, the Danavas, and human<br>beings, and Rishis, call Janardana the slayer of Madhu. He is the great<br>Boar. He is the great Lion, and He is the Three-stepped Lord.[388] He is<br>the Mother and the Father of all living creatures. There never was, nor<br>will be, any superior to Him of eyes like lotus-petals. From His mouth He<br>created the Brahmanas: and from His two arms the Kshatriyas, and from His<br>thighs, O king, He created the Vaisyas, and from His feet He created the<br>Sudras. One waiting dutifully on Him, observant of vows with ascetic<br>austerities on days of the full-moon and the new-moon, is sure to obtain<br>the Divine Kesava, that refuge of all embodied creatures that essence of<br>Brahma and of Yoga. Kesava is the higher Energy, the Grandsire of all the<br>worlds. Him, O king, the sages call Hrishikesa (the lord of the senses).<br>Him also should all know as the Preceptor, the Father, and the Master.<br>Inexhaustible regions (of blessedness) are won by him with whom Krishna<br>is gratified. He also who, in a place of fear, seeketh the protection of<br>Kesava, and he who frequently readeth this description, becometh happy<br>and endued with every prosperity. Those men who attain to Krishna are<br>never beguiled, Janardana always saveth those that are sunk in great<br>terrors. Knowing this truly, O Bharata, Yudhishthira, with his whole<br>soul, O king, hath sought the shelter of the highly blessed Kesava, the<br>Lord of Yoga, and the Lord of the Earth."
