                            [(Bhagavad Gita, Chapter XIII)]<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'This body, O son of Kunti, is called Kshetra. Him<br>who knoweth it, the learned call Kshetrajna.[260] Know me, O Bharata, to<br>be Kshetras. The knowledge of Kshetra and Kshetrajna I regard to be<br>(true) knowledge. What that Kshetra (is), and what (it is) like, and what<br>changes it undergoes, and whence (it comes), what is he (viz.,<br>Kshetrajna), and what his powers are, hear from me in brief. All this<br>hath in many ways been sung separately, by Rishis in various verses, in<br>well-settled texts fraught with reason and giving indications of Brahman.<br>The great elements, egoism, intellect, the unmanifest (viz., Prakriti),<br>also the ten senses, the one (manas), the five objects of sense, desire,<br>aversion, pleasure, pain, body consciousness, courage,&#8212;all this in brief<br>hath been declared to be Kshetra in its modified form. Absence of vanity,<br>absence of ostentation, abstention from injury, forgiveness, uprightness,<br>devotion to preceptor, purity, constancy, self-restraint, indifference to<br>objects of sense, absence of egoism, perception of the misery and evil of<br>birth, death, decrepitude and disease,[261] freedom from attachment,<br>absence of sympathy for son, wife, home, and the rest, and constant<br>equanimity of heart on attainment of good and evil, unswerving devotion<br>to me without meditation on anything else, frequenting of lonely places,<br>distaste for concourse of men,[262] constancy in the knowledge of the<br>relation of the individual self to the supreme, perception of the object<br>of the knowledge of truth,&#8212;all this is called Knowledge; all that which<br>is contrary to this is Ignorance.[263] That which is the object of<br>knowledge I will (now) declare (to thee), knowing which one obtaineth<br>immortality. [It is] the Supreme Brahma having no beginning, who is said<br>to be neither existent nor non-existent; whose hands and feet are on all<br>sides, whose eyes, heads and faces are on all sides, who dwells pervading<br>everything in the world, who is possessed of all the qualities of the<br>senses (though) devoid of the senses, without attachment (yet) sustaining<br>all things, without attributes (yet) enjoying (a) all attributes,[264]<br>without and within all creatures, immobile and mobile, not knowable<br>because of (his) subtlety, remote yet near, undistributed in all beings,<br>(yet) remaining as if distributed, who is the sustainer of (all) beings,<br>the absorber and the creator (of all); who is the light of all luminous<br>bodies, who is said to be beyond all darkness; who is knowledge, the<br>Object of knowledge, the End of knowledge and seated in the hearts of<br>all. Thus Kshetra, and Knowledge, and the Object of Knowledge, have been<br>declared (to thee) in brief. My devotee, knowing (all) this, becomes one<br>in spirit with me. Know that Nature and Spirit are both without beginning<br>(and) know (also) that all modifications and all qualities spring from<br>Nature.[265] Nature is said to be the source of the capacity of enjoying<br>pleasures and pains.[266] For Spirit, dwelling in nature enjoyeth the<br>qualities born of Nature. The cause of its births in good or evil wombs<br>is (its) connection with the qualities.[267] The Supreme Purusha in this<br>body is said to be surveyor, approver, supporter, enjoyer, the mighty<br>lord, and also the Supreme Soul.[268] He who thus knows Spirit, and<br>Nature, with the qualities, in whatever state he may be, is never born<br>again. Some by meditation behold the self in the self by the self; others<br>by devotion according to the Sankhya system; and others (again), by<br>devotion through works. Others yet not knowing this, worship, hearing of<br>it from others. Even these, devoted to what is heard, cross over<br>death.[269] Whatever entity, immobile or mobile, cometh into existence,<br>know that, O bull of Bharata's race, to be from the connection of Kshetra<br>and Kshetrajna (matter and spirit). He seeth the Supreme Lord dwelling<br>alike in all beings, the Imperishable in the Perishable. For seeing the<br>Lord dwelling alike everywhere, one doth not destroy[270] himself by<br>himself, and then reacheth the highest goal. He seeth (truly) who seeth<br>all actions to be wrought by nature alone in every way and the self<br>likewise to be not the doer. When one seeth the diversity of entities as<br>existing in one, and the issue (everything) from that (One), then is one<br>said to attain to Brahma. This inexhaustible Supreme Self, O son of<br>Kunti, being without beginning and without attributes, doth not act, nor<br>is stained even when stationed in the body. As space, which is<br>ubiquitous, is never, in consequence of its subtlety tainted, so the<br>soul, stationed in every body, is never tainted.[271] As the single Sun<br>lights up the entire world, so the Spirit, O Bharata, lights up the<br>entire (sphere of) matters. They that, by the eye of knowledge, know the<br>distinction between matter and spirit, and the deliverance from the<br>nature of all entities, attain to the Supreme.[272]
