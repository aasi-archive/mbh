                            Sanjaya said, "Then those kings, excited with rage, beholding Phalguni in<br>battle, surrounded him on all sides with many thousands of cars. And<br>having, O Bharata surrounded him with multitudinous division of cars,<br>they shrouded him from all sides with many thousands of shafts. And<br>bright lances of sharp points, and maces, and clubs endued with spikes,<br>and bearded darts and battle-axes, and mallets and bludgeons they hurled<br>at Phalguni's car, excited with rage. And that shower of weapons<br>approaching (towards him) like a flight of locusts, Pritha's son checked<br>on all sides with his gold-decked arrows. And beholding there on that<br>occasion the superhuman lightness of hand that Vibhatsu possessed, the<br>gods, the Danavas, the Gandharvas, the Pisachas, the Uragas and the<br>Rakshasas eulogised Phalguni, O king, saying,&#8212;'Excellent, Excellent.'<br>And the heroic Gandharvas along with Suvala's son with a large force<br>surrounded Satyaki and Abhimanyu. Then the brave warriors led by Suvala's<br>son from anger, cut into pieces the excellent car of the Vrishni hero,<br>with weapons of diverse kinds. And in course of that fierce conflict,<br>Satyaki, abandoning that car of his, speedily mounted on Abhimanyu's car,<br>O chastiser of foes. And those two, mounted on the same car, then began<br>to speedily slaughter the army of Suvala's son with straight arrows of<br>sharp points. And Drona and Bhishma, steadily struggling in battle, began<br>to slaughter the division of king Yudhishthira the just, with sharp<br>shafts furnished with the feathers of the Kanka bird. Then the son of<br>Dharma and two other sons of Pandu by Madri, in the very sight of the<br>whole army, began to grind the division of Drona. And the battle that<br>took place there was fierce and awful, making the hair stand on end, like<br>the terrible battle that took place between the gods and the Asuras in<br>days of yore. And Bhimasena and Ghatotkacha, both achieved mighty feats.<br>Then Duryodhana, approaching, checked them both. And the prowess we then<br>beheld of Hidimva's son was exceedingly wonderful, insomuch that he<br>fought in battle, O Bharata, transcending his very father. And Bhimasena,<br>the son of Pandu, excited with wrath, pierced the vindictive Duryodhana<br>in the breast, with an arrow, smiling the while. Then king Duryodhana,<br>afflicted by the violence of that blow, sat down on the terrace of his<br>car and swooned away. And his charioteer then, beholding him senseless,<br>speedily bore him away, O king, from battle. And then the troops that<br>supported Duryodhana broke and fled. And thereupon Bhima, smiting that<br>Kuru army thus flying away in all directions, with sharp-pointed shafts,<br>pursued it behind. And Prishata's son (Dhrishtadyumna), that foremost of<br>warriors, and Pandu's son king Yudhishthira, the just, in the very sight,<br>O Bharata, of both Drona and Ganga's son, slew their army with sharp<br>shafts capable of slaying hostile forces. That host of thy son, thus<br>flying away in battle, those mighty car-warriors. Bhishma and Drona were<br>incapable of checking. For though attempted to be checked by Bhishma and<br>the high-souled Drona, that host fled away in the very sight of Drona and<br>Bhishma. And then when (those) thousand of car-warriors fled away in all<br>directions, Subhadra's son and that bull of Sini's race, both stationed<br>on the same car, began, O chastiser of foes, to slaughter the army of<br>Suvala's son of battle. And Sini's grandson and that bull of Kuru's race<br>looked resplendent like the sun and the moon when together in the<br>firmament after the last lunation of the dark fortnight has passed away.<br>And then Arjuna also, O king, excited with rage, showered arrows on thy<br>army like the clouds pouring rain in torrents. And the Kaurava army, thus<br>slaughtered in battle with the shafts of Partha, fled away, trembling in<br>grief and fear. And beholding the army flying away, the mighty Bhishma<br>and Drona, excited with rage and both desirous of Duryodhana's welfare<br>sought to cheek it. Then king Duryodhana himself, comforting the<br>combatants, checked that army, then flying away in all directions. And<br>thereupon all the mighty Kshatriya car-warriors stopped, each at the spot<br>where he saw thy son. And then others among the common soldiers,<br>beholding them stop, stopped of their own accord, O king, from shame and<br>desire of displaying their courage unto one another. And the impetuosity,<br>O king, of that army thus rallied to the fight resembled that of the<br>surging sea at the moment of the moon's rise. And king Duryodhana,<br>beholding that army of his rallied for the fight, quickly repaired to<br>Santanu's son Bhishma and said these words. 'O grandsire, listen to what<br>I say, O Bharata. When, O son of Kuru, thou art alive, and Drona, that<br>foremost of persons conversant with weapons, along with his son and with<br>all our other friends (is alive), and then that mighty bowman Kripa also<br>is alive, I do not regard it as at all creditable that my army should<br>thus fly away. I do not regard the Pandavas to be, by any means, a match<br>for thee or for Drona, in battle, or for Drona's son, or for Kripa.<br>Without doubt, O grandsire, the sons of Pandu are being favoured by thee,<br>inasmuch as thou forgivest, O hero, this slaughter of my army. Thou<br>shouldst have told me, O king, before this battle took place, that thou<br>wouldst not fight with the Pandavas. Hearing such words from thee, as<br>also from the preceptor, O Bharata, I would then have, with Karna,<br>reflected upon what course I should pursue. If I do not deserve to be<br>abandoned by you two in battle, then, O bulls among men, do ye fight<br>according to the measure of your prowess. Hearing these words, Bhishma,<br>laughing repeatedly, and turning up his eyes in wrath, said to thy son,<br>'Many a time, O king, have I said unto thee words worthy of thy<br>acceptance and fraught with thy good. The Pandavas are incapable of being<br>vanquished in battle by the very gods with Vasava amongst them. That,<br>however, which my aged self is capable of doing, I will do to the extent<br>of my power, O best of kings, in this battle. Witness it now with thy<br>kinsmen. Today, in the very sight of all, alone I shall check the sons of<br>Pandu at the head of their troops and with all their kinsfolk.' Thus<br>addressed by Bhishma, thy son, O king, filled with delight, caused<br>conches to be blown and drums to be beaten. And the Pandavas also, O<br>king, hearing that loud uproar, blew their conches, and caused their<br>drums and cymbals to be played upon."
