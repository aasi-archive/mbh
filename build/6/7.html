                            "Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;'Tell me, O Sanjaya, thou of great intelligence, of<br>the regions to the north and the east side of Meru, as also of the<br>mountains of Malyavat, in detail.[50]<br><br>"Sanjaya said,&#8212;'On the south of the Nila mountain and the northern side<br>of Meru are the sacred Northern Kurus, O king, which are the residence of<br>the Siddhas. The trees there bear sweet fruits, and are always covered<br>with fruits and flowers. All the flowers (there) are fragrant, and the<br>fruits of excellent taste. Some of the trees, again, O king, yield fruits<br>according to (the) will (of the plucker). There are again some other<br>trees, O king, that are called milk-yielding. These always yield milk and<br>the six different kinds of food of the taste of Amrita itself. Those<br>trees also yield cloths and in their fruits are ornaments (for the use of<br>man). The entire land abounds with fine golden sands. A portion of the<br>region there, extremely delightful, is seen to be possessed of the<br>radiance of the ruby or diamond, or of the lapis lazuli or other jewels<br>and gems.[51] All the seasons there are agreeable and nowhere does the<br>land become miry, O king. The tanks are charming, delicious, and full of<br>crystal water. The men born there have dropped from the world of the<br>celestials.[52] All are of pure birth and all are extremely handsome in<br>appearance. There twins (of opposite sexes) are born and the women<br>resemble Apsaras in beauty. They drink the milk, sweet as Amrita, of<br>those milk-yielding trees (already mentioned). And the twins born there<br>(of opposite sexes) grow up equally. Both possessed of equal beauty, both<br>endued with similar virtues, and both equally dressed, both grow up in<br>love, O monarch, like a couple of chakrabakas. The people of that country<br>are free from illness and are always cheerful. Ten thousand and ten<br>hundred years they live, O king, and never abandon one another. A class<br>of birds called Bharunda, furnished with sharp beaks and possessed of<br>great strength, take them up when dead and throw them into mountain<br>caves. I have now described to thee, O king, the Northern Kurus briefly.<br><br>"I will now describe to thee the eastern side of Meru duly. Of all the<br>regions there, the foremost, O king, is called Bhadraswa, where there is<br>a large forest of Bhadra-salas, as also a huge tree called Kalamra. This<br>Kalamra, O king, is always graced with fruits and flowers. That tree<br>again is a Yojana in height and is adored by Siddhas[53] and the<br>Charanas. The men there are all of a white complexion, endued with great<br>energy, and possessed of great strength. The women are of the complexion<br>of lilies, very beautiful, and agreeable to sight. Possessed of radiance<br>of the moon,[54] and white as the moon, their faces are as the full-moon.<br>Their bodies again are as cool as the rays of the moon and they are all<br>accomplished in singing and dancing. The period of human life there, O<br>bull of the Bharata's race, is ten thousand years. Drinking the juice of<br>the Kalamra they continue youthful for ever. On the south of Nila and the<br>north of Nishadha, there is a huge Jamvu tree that is eternal. Adored by<br>the Siddhas and Charanas, that sacred tree granteth every wish. After the<br>name of that tree this division hath ever been called Jamvudwipa. O bull<br>of Bharata race, a thousand and a hundred Yojanas is the height of that<br>prince of trees, which touches the very heavens, O king of men. Two<br>thousand and five hundred cubits measure the circumference of a fruit of<br>that tree which bursts when ripe. In falling upon the earth these fruits<br>make a loud noise, and then pour out, O king, a silvery juice on the<br>ground. That juice of the Jamvu, becoming, O king, a river, and passing<br>circuitously round Meru, cometh to the (region of the) Northern Kurus. If<br>the juice of that fruit is quaffed, it conduces to peace of mind. No<br>thirst is felt ever after, O king. Decrepitude never weakens them. And<br>there a species of gold called Jamvunada and used for celestial<br>ornaments, very brilliant and like the complexion of Indragopoka insects,<br>is produced. The men born there are of the complexion of the morning sun.<br><br>"'On the summit of Malyavat is always seen, O bull of Bharata's race, the<br>fire called Samvataka which blazeth forth at the end of the Yuga for the<br>destruction of the universe. On Malyavat's summit towards the east are<br>many small mountains and Malyavat, O king, measures eleven thousand[55]<br>Yojanas. The men born there are of the complexion of gold. And they are<br>all fallen from the region of Brahman and are utterers of Brahma. They<br>undergo the severest of ascetic austerities, and their vital seed is<br>drawn up. For the protection of creatures they all enter the sun.<br>Numbering sixty-six thousand, they proceed in advance of Aruna,<br>surrounding the sun. Heated with the sun's rays for sixty-six thousand<br>years, they then enter the lunar disc.'"
