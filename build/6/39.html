                            [(Bhagavad Gita Chapter XV)]<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'They say that the Aswattha, having its roots above<br>and branches below, is eternal, its leaves are the Chhandas. He who<br>knoweth it, knoweth the Vedas.[279] Downwards and upwards are stretched<br>its branches which are enlarged by the qualities; its sprouts are the<br>objects of senses. Downwards its roots, leading to action, are extended<br>to this world of men.[280] Its form cannot here (below) be thus known,<br>nor (its) end, nor (its) beginning, nor (its) support. Cutting, with the<br>hard weapon of unconcern, this Aswattha of roots firmly fixed, then<br>should one seek for that place repairing whither one returneth not again<br>(thinking)&#8212;I will seek the protection of that Primeval Sire from whom<br>the ancient course of (worldly) life hath flowed.&#8212;Those that are free<br>from pride and delusion, that have subdued the evil of attachment, that<br>are steady in the contemplation of the relation of the Supreme to the<br>individual self, from whom desire hath departed, freed from the pairs of<br>opposites known by the names of pleasure and pain (and the like), repair,<br>undeluded, to that eternal seat. The sun lighteth not that [seat], nor<br>the moon, nor fire. Whither going none returneth, that is my supreme<br>seat. An eternal portion of Me is that which, becoming an individual soul<br>in the world of life, draweth to itself the (five) senses with the mind<br>as the sixth which all depend on nature. When the sovereign (of this<br>bodily frame) assumeth or quitteth (a) body, it departeth taking away<br>these, like the wind (taking away) perfumes from their seats. Presiding<br>over the ear, the eye, (the organs of) touch, taste, and smell, and also<br>over the mind, he enjoyeth all objects of senses. They that are deluded<br>do not see (him) when quitting or abiding in (the body), when enjoying or<br>joined to the qualities. They (however) see that have the eye of<br>knowledge.[281] Devotees exerting (towards that end) behold him dwelling<br>in themselves. They (however) that are senseless and whose minds are not<br>restrained, behold him not, even while exerting (themselves).[282] That<br>splendour dwelling in the sun which illumines the vast universe, that<br>(which is) in the moon, and that (which is) in the fire, know that<br>splendour to be mine. Entering into the earth I uphold creatures by my<br>force; and becoming the juicy moon I nourish all herbs.[283] Myself<br>becoming the vital heat (Vaiswanara) residing in the bodies of creatures<br>that breathe, (and) uniting with the upward and the downward<br>life-breaths, I digest the four kinds of food.[284] I am seated in the<br>hearts of all. From Me are memory and knowledge and the loss of both. I<br>am the objects of knowledge to be known by (the aid of) all the Vedas. I<br>am the author of the Vedantas, and I alone am the knower of the<br>Vedas.[285] There are these two entities in the world, viz., the mutable<br>and the immutable. The mutable is all (these) creatures. The unchangeable<br>one is called the immutable.[286] But there is another, the Supreme<br>Being, called Paramatman, who was the Eternal Lord, pervading the three<br>worlds, sustaineth (them) (and) since I transcend the mutable, and am<br>higher than even the immutable; for this I am celebrated in the world<br>(among men) and in the Veda as Purushottama (the Highest Being). He who,<br>without being deluded, knoweth Me as this Highest Being,&#8212;he knowing all,<br>O Bharata, worshippeth Me in every way.[287] Thus, O sinless one, hath<br>this knowledge, forming the greatest of mysteries, been declared by Me<br>(to thee). Knowing this, O Bharata, one will become gifted with<br>intelligence, and will have done all he needs do.'
