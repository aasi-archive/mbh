                            Sanjaya said, "Then, O king, the mighty-armed Satyaki invincible in<br>battle, drawing in that conflict an excellent bow capable of bearing a<br>great strain shot innumerable winged arrows resembling snakes of virulent<br>poison, displaying his wonderful lightness of hand. And while slaying his<br>foes in battle, so quickly did he draw the bow, take out his arrows, fix<br>them on the bowstring, and letting them off throw them among the foe,<br>that he then seemed to be a mass of clouds pouring a thick shower of<br>rain. Beholding him then thus blazing up (like a swelling fire), king<br>Duryodhana, O Bharata, despatched ten thousand cars against him. But that<br>great bowman, Satyaki, of prowess incapable of being baffled and<br>possessed of great energy, slew with his celestial weapons all those<br>mighty car-warriors. Having achieved, bow in hand, that fierce feat, that<br>hero then approached Bhurisravas in battle. And Bhurisravas also, that<br>enhancer of the fame of the Kurus, beholding the Dhartarashtra ranks thus<br>felled by Yuyudhana, rushed in wrath against the latter.[400] Drawing his<br>great bow which resembled that of Indra himself in hue, he shot thousands<br>of shafts, O monarch, looking like snakes of virulent poison and<br>possessed of the strength of the thunder, displaying his extreme<br>lightness of hand. Thereupon the combatants that followed Satyaki, unable<br>to bear those shafts of fatal touch, fled away, O king, in all<br>directions, abandoning, O monarch, the invincible Satyaki in that<br>conflict. Beholding this, the mighty sons of Yuyudhana, all mighty<br>car-warriors of great renown, cased in excellent mail, bearing diverse<br>arms, and possessing excellent standards, approaching that great bowman,<br>viz., Bhurisravas, in battle, wrathfully addressed that warrior bearing<br>on his standard the device of a sacrificial stake, and said these words,<br>'Listen, O kinsman of the Kauravas, O thou that art possessed of great<br>strength, come, fight in battle with us, i.e., with either all of us<br>jointly or with each of us separately. Vanquishing us in battle thou<br>mayst win great renown, or ourselves, vanquishing thee, will have great<br>gratification.' Thus addressed by them, that mighty hero endued with<br>great strength and proud of his prowess, that foremost of men, beholding<br>them before him, replied unto them, saying, 'Ye heroes, ye have said<br>well. If such be now your wish, fight ye then all together with care. I<br>shall slay all of you in battle.' Thus addressed by him, those heroic and<br>mighty bowmen endued with great activity covered that chastiser of foes<br>with a thick shower of arrows. And it was towards the afternoon, O king,<br>that that dreadful battle took place between Bhurisravas alone on one<br>side and the many united together on the other. And those ten heroes<br>covered that single mighty car-warrior with showers of arrows like the<br>clouds showering rain on a mountain cliff in the season of rains. That<br>mighty car-warrior, however, cut off, those clouds of shafts shot by them<br>resembling the fatal darts of Death or the very thunder in effulgence,<br>before they could reach him.[401] They then, surrounding that<br>mighty-armed warrior, endeavoured to slay him. But the son of Somadatta,<br>excited with rage, cut off their bows, O Bharata, and then their heads,<br>with sharp shafts. Thus slain, they fell down, O monarch, like mighty<br>trees felled by the thunder.[402] Beholding then his mighty sons thus<br>slain in battle, the Vrishni hero (Satyaki), O king, uttering a loud<br>roar, rushed against Bhurisravas. And those mighty warriors then each<br>pressed his car against the other. And each of them in that combat slew<br>the other's car-steeds. And both deprived of their cars, those mighty<br>warriors jumped down on the ground. And both taking up large scimitars<br>and excellent shields encountered each other. And those tigers among men,<br>stationed for the encounter, shone brightly. Then Bhimasena, O king,<br>quickly coming up to Satyaki thus armed with an excellent scimitar, took<br>him up on his own car. And thy son also, O monarch, speedily took up<br>Bhurisravas on his car, in that battle, at the very sight of all the<br>bowmen.<br><br>"Meanwhile, during the continuance of that battle, the Pandavas, O bull<br>of Bharata's race, excited with wrath, fought with that mighty<br>car-warrior Bhishma. And when the sun assumed a red hue, Dhananjaya<br>exerting himself actively, slew five and twenty thousand great<br>car-warriors. These, urged on by Duryodhana for slaying Partha, were thus<br>completely destroyed before they could even come up to him, like insects<br>on a blazing fire. Then the Matsyas and the Kekayas, all accomplished in<br>the science of arms, surrounded that mighty car-warrior Partha as also<br>his son (for supporting them). Just at that time the sun disappeared, and<br>all the combatants seemed to be deprived of their senses. Then at<br>twilight, O king, thy sire Devavrata, his animals having been tired,<br>caused the troops to be withdrawn. And the troops of both the Pandavas<br>and the Kurus, filled with fear and anxiety in course of that dreadful<br>encounter, proceeded to their respective camps, the Pandavas with the<br>Srinjayas and the Kauravas also rested for the night agreeably to the<br>rules (of military science)."
