                            Sanjaya said, "On the forenoon of that awful day, O king, the terrible<br>battle that mangled the bodies of (so many) kings commenced. And the loud<br>shouts, resembling leonine roars of the Kurus and the Srinjayas, both<br>desirous of victory in battle, made both the welkin and the earth resound<br>therewith. And a tumultuous uproar was heard mingled with the flaps of<br>leathern fences and the blare of conches. And many were the leonine roars<br>that rose there of men shouting against one another. And, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, the sound of bowstrings stretched by (hands cased in)<br>fences, the heavy tread of infantry, the furious neigh of chargers, the<br>falling of sticks and iron hooks (on the beads of elephants), the clash<br>of weapons, the jingle of bells of elephants rushing against one another,<br>and the clatter of cars resembling the roar of clouds, mingled together,<br>produced a loud uproar making one's hair stand on end. And all the Kuru<br>warriors, reckless of their very lives and with cruel intentions, rushed,<br>with standards upraised, against the Pandavas. And Santanu's son himself,<br>taking up a terrible bow that resembled the rod of Death, rushed, O king,<br>on the field of battle, against Dhananjaya. And Arjuna also, endued with<br>great energy, taking up the bow Gandiva celebrated overall the world,<br>rushed, on the field of battle, against Ganga's son. And both those<br>tigers among the Kurus became desirous of slaying each other. The mighty<br>son of Ganga however, piercing in battle the son of Pritha could not make<br>him waver. And so, O king, the son of Pandu also could not make Bhishma<br>waver in battle. And the mighty bowman Satyaki rushed against<br>Kritavarman. And the battle between these two was fierce in the extreme<br>and made the hair (of onlookers) stand on end. And Satyaki afflicted<br>Kritavarman, and Kritavarman afflicted Satyaki, with loud shouts and each<br>weakened the other. And pierced all over with arrows those mighty<br>warriors shone like two blossoming Kinsukas in spring adorned with<br>flowers. And the mighty bowman Abhimanyu battled with Vrihadvala. Soon,<br>however, in that encounter, O king, the ruler of Kosala cut off the<br>standard and overthrew the charioteer of Subhadra's son. The son of<br>Subhadra then upon the overthrow of his charioteer, was filled with wrath<br>and pierced Vrihadvala, O king, with nine shafts, and with a couple of<br>sharp arrows that grinder of foes also cut off (Vrihadvala's) standard,<br>and with one (more) cut off one of the protectors of his car-wheels and<br>with the other his charioteer.[323] And those chastisers of foes<br>continued to weaken each other with sharp arrows. And Bhimasena struggled<br>in battle with thy son Duryodhana, that mighty car-warrior, proud and<br>inflated, who had injured (the sons of Pandu). Both of those foremost<br>(princes) among the Kurus, are tigers among men and mighty car-warriors.<br>And they covered each other, on the field of battle, with their arrowy<br>showers. And beholding those high-souled and accomplished warriors<br>conversant with all modes of warfare, all creatures were filled with<br>amazement of Bharata. And Dussasana, rushing against that mighty<br>car-warrior Nakula, pierced him with many sharp arrows capable of<br>penetrating into the very vitals. The son of Madri, then, laughing the<br>while, cut off, with sharp arrows (of his), adversary's standard and bow,<br>and then he struck him with five and twenty small-headed arrows. Thy son,<br>however, then, who can with difficulty be vanquished, slew in that fierce<br>encounter the steeds of Nakula and cut off his standard. And Durmukha<br>rushing against the mighty Sahadeva battling in that terrific encounter,<br>pierced him with a shower of arrows. The heroic Sahadeva then, in that<br>fearful battle, overthrew Durmukha's charioteer with an arrow of great<br>sharpness. Both of them, irrepressible in fight, approaching each other<br>in combat, and each attacking the other and desirous of warding off the<br>other's attack, began to strike terror into each other with terrible<br>shafts. And king Yudhishthira himself encountered the ruler of the<br>Madras. The chief of the Madras then in his very sight cut off in twain<br>Yudhishthira's bow. Thereupon the son of Kunti, throwing aside that<br>broken bow, took up another that was stronger and capable of imparting a<br>greater velocity. The king then, with straight arrows, covered the ruler<br>of the Madras, and in great wrath said, 'wait, wait'. And Dhrishtadyumna,<br>O Bharata rushed against Drona. And Drona, then, in great wrath, cut off<br>in that encounter the hard bow of the high-souled prince of Panchala that<br>was capable of always taking the lives of foes. And at the same time he<br>shot in that conflict a terrible arrow that was like a second rod of<br>Death. And the arrow shot penetrated the body of the prince. Taking up<br>then another bow and fourteen arrows, the son of Drupada pierced Drona in<br>that encounter. And enraged with each other, they battled on fiercely.<br>And the impetuous Sankha encountered Somadatta's son who was equally<br>impetuous in battle and addressed him, O king, saying 'wait, wait'. And<br>that hero then pierced his (adversary's) right arm in that combat. And<br>thereupon the son of Somadatta struck Sankha on the shoulders. And the<br>battle that ensued between those two proud heroes, O king, soon became as<br>terrible as a combat between the gods and the Danavas. And that mighty<br>car-warrior Dhrishtaketu of immeasurable soul, with wrath excited, rushed<br>in battle, O king, against Valhika, the very embodiment of wrath.<br>Valhika, then, O king, setting up a leonine roar, weakened the wrathful<br>Dhrishtaketu with innumerable arrows. The king of the Chedis, however,<br>exceedingly provoked, quickly pierced Valhika in that encounter with nine<br>arrows. Like an infuriate elephant against an infuriate elephant, in that<br>combat they roared against each other repeatedly, both exceedingly<br>enraged. And they encountered each other with great wrath and looked like<br>the planets Angaraka and Sukra.[324] And Ghatotkacha of cruel deeds<br>encountered the Rakshasa Alamvusha of cruel deeds like Sakra<br>(encountering) Vala in battle. And Ghatotkacha, O Bharata, pierced that<br>infuriate and powerful Rakshasa with ninety keen-edged shafts. And<br>Alamvusha also in that combat pierced the mighty son of Bhimasena in many<br>places with straight arrows (of his). And mangled with arrows they shone<br>in that encounter like the mighty Sakra and the powerful Vala in the<br>combat (of old) between the celestials and the Asuras. The powerful<br>Sikhandin, O king, rushed against Drona's son, Aswatthaman, however<br>deeply piercing the angry Sikhandin stationed (before him) with a<br>keen-edged shaft, caused him to tremble, Sikhandin also, O king, smote<br>Drona's son with a sharp-whetted shaft of excellent temper. And they<br>continued in that encounter to strike each other with various kinds of<br>arrows. And against the heroic Bhagadatta in battle, Virata, the<br>commander of a large division, rushed impetuously, O king, and then<br>commenced (their) combat. Virata, exceedingly provoked, poured on<br>Bhagadatta an arrowy shower like, O Bharata, the clouds showering rain on<br>the mountain breast. But Bhagadatta, that lord of the earth, speedily<br>enveloped Virata in that encounter (with arrows) like the clouds<br>enveloping the risen sun. Kripa, the son of Saradwat, rushed against<br>Vrihadkshatra, the ruler of the Kaikeyas. And Kripa, O Bharata, enveloped<br>him with a shower of arrows. Vrihadkshatra also shrouded the infuriate<br>son of Gautama with an arrowy downpour. And those warriors, then, having<br>slain each other's steeds and cut off each other's bows, were both<br>deprived of their cars. And exceedingly enraged, they then approached<br>each other for fighting with their swords. And the combat which then took<br>place between them was terrible in aspect and unparalleled. That<br>chastiser of foes, king Drupada, then, in great wrath rushed against<br>Jayadratha, the ruler of the Sindhus, cheerfully waiting (for battle).<br>The ruler of the Sindhus pierced Drupada in that combat with three<br>shafts, and Drupada pierced him in return. And the battle that took place<br>between them was terrible and fierce, and productive of satisfaction in<br>the hearts of all the spectators and resembling a conflict between the<br>planets Sukra and Angaraka. And Vikarna, son to thee, with fleet steeds,<br>rushed against the mighty Sutasoma and the combat between them commenced.<br>Vikarna, however, although he pierced Sutasoma with many arrows, failed<br>to make him waver. Neither could Sutasoma make Vikarna waver. And that<br>appeared wonderful (to all). And against Susarman, that mighty<br>car-warrior and tiger among men, viz., Chekitana of great prowess, rushed<br>in exceeding wrath for the sake of the Pandavas. And Susarman also, O<br>great king, in that encounter checked the advance of that mighty<br>car-warrior Chekitana with plentiful shower of arrows. And Chekitana<br>also, greatly provoked, showered on Susarman, in that terrible conflict,<br>a shower of arrows like a mighty mass of clouds showering rain on the<br>mountain breast. And Sakuni, endued with great prowess, rushed, O king,<br>against Prativindhya[325] of great prowess, like a lion against an<br>infuriate elephant. Thereupon the son of Yudhishthira, in exceeding<br>wrath, mangled Suvala's son in that combat, with sharp arrows, like<br>Maghavat[326] (mangling) a Danava. And Sakuni also, in that fierce<br>conflict, pierced Prativindhya in return and mangled that warrior of<br>great intelligence with straight arrows. And Srutakarman rushed in<br>battle, O great king, against that mighty car-warrior Sudakshina of great<br>prowess, the ruler of the Kamvojas. Sudakshina, however, O great king,<br>piercing that mighty car-warrior, viz., the son of Sahadeva, failed to<br>make him waver (for he stood) like the Mainaka mountain (against the<br>assaults of Indra). Thereupon Srutakarman, exceedingly provoked, weakened<br>that mighty car-warrior of the Kamvojas with innumerable arrows and<br>mangled him in every part of his body. And Iravan, that chastiser of<br>foes, in great wrath and exerting carefully, rushed in battle against the<br>wrathful Srutayush. The powerful son of Arjuna, that mighty car-warrior,<br>then slaying the steeds of his adversary, set up a loud roar, and<br>thereupon, O king, all the warriors (who saw the feat) praised him<br>greatly. And Srutasena also, exceedingly provoked, slew in that conflict<br>the steeds of Falguni's son with a powerful mace, and the battle between<br>them continued. And Vinda and Anuvinda, those two princes of Avanti,<br>approached in battle that mighty car-warrior the heroic Kuntibhoja at the<br>head of his troops accompanied by his son. And wonderful was the prowess<br>we beheld of those two princes on that occasion, for they fought on very<br>cooly though battling with a large body of troops. And Anuvinda hurled a<br>mace at Kuntibhoja, but Kuntibhoja quickly covered him with a shower of<br>arrows. And the son of Kuntibhoja pierced Vinda with many arrows, and the<br>latter also pierced him in return. And the combat (between them) looked<br>very wonderful. And the Kekaya brothers, O sire, at the head of their<br>troops, encountered in battle the five Gandhara princes with their<br>troops. And thy son Viravahu battled with that best of car-warriors<br>Uttara, the son of Virata and pierced him with nine arrows. And Uttara<br>also pierced that hero with sharp-edged arrows. And the ruler of the<br>Chedis, O king, rushed in battle against Uluka. And he pierced Uluka with<br>a shower of arrows, and Uluka also pierced him with sharp arrows<br>furnished with excellent wing. And the combat that took place between<br>them, O king, was fierce in the extreme, for unable to vanquish each<br>other, they mangled each other terribly. And thus in that general<br>engagement thousands of single combats took place between men on car,<br>warriors on elephants and horsemen, and foot-soldiers, of their side and<br>thine. For a short while only that engagement offered a beautiful sight.<br>Soon, however, O king, it became furious and nothing could be discovered.<br>In the battle (that ensued) elephants rushed against elephants,<br>car-warriors against car-warriors, steed against steed and foot-soldier<br>against foot-soldier. The conflict then became confused and fierce in the<br>extreme, of heroes rushing against each other in the melee. And the<br>celestial Rishi, and Siddhas and Charanas, that were present there,<br>beheld that terrific battle to resemble the combat of the gods and the<br>Asuras. And elephants in thousands, and cars also in thousands, and vast<br>bodies of infantry, O sire, seemed to alter their character.[327] And, O<br>tiger among men, it was seen that cars and elephants and steeds and<br>infantry fought with each other repeatedly on the same places.[328]
