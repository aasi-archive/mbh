                            "Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;'Tell me, O Sanjaya, of the period of life, the<br>strength, the good and bad things, the future, past and present, of the<br>residents, O Suta, of this Varsha of Bharata, and of the Himavat-varsha,<br>as also of Hari-varsha, in detail."<br><br>"Sanjaya said,&#8212;'O bull of Bharata's race, four Yugas set in Bharata's<br>Varsha, viz., Krita, Treta, Dwapara, and Kali. The Yuga that sets in<br>first is Krita. O Lord; after the expiry of Krita comes Treta; after<br>expiry of Treta comes Dwapara; and after that last of all, sets in Kali.<br>Four thousand years, O best of the Kurus, are reckoned as the measure of<br>life, O best of kings, in the Krita epoch. Three thousand years is the<br>period in Treta, O ruler of men. At present in Dwapara, persons live on<br>Earth for two thousand years. In Kali, however, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>there is no fixed limit of life's measure, in so much that men die while<br>in the womb, as also soon after birth. In the Krita age, O king, men are<br>born and beget children, by hundreds and thousands, that are of great<br>strength and great power, endued with the attribute of great wisdom, and<br>possessed of wealth and handsome features. In that age are born and<br>begotten Munis endued with wealth of asceticism, capable of great<br>exertion, possessed of high souls, and virtuous, and truthful in speech.<br>The Kshatriyas also, born in that age are of agreeable features,<br>able-bodied, possessed of great energy, accomplished in the use of the<br>bow, highly skilled in battle and exceedingly brave. In the Treta age, O<br>king, all the Kshatriya kings were emperors ruling from sea to sea. In<br>Treta are begotten brave Kshatriyas not subject to any one, endued with<br>long lives, possessed of heroism, and wielding the bow in battle with<br>great skill. When Dwapara sets in, O king, all the (four) orders born<br>become capable of great exertion, endued with great energy, and desirous<br>of conquering one another. The men born in Kali, O king, are endued with<br>little energy, highly wrathful, covetous, and untruthful. Jealousy,<br>pride, anger, deception, malice and covetousness, O Bharata, are the<br>attributes of creatures in the Kali age. The portion that remains, O<br>king, of this the Dwapara age, is small, O ruler of men. The Varsha known<br>as Haimavat is superior to Bharatavarsha, while Harivarsha is superior to<br>Hainavatvarsha, in respect of all qualities.'
