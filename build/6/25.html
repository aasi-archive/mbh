                            [(Bhagavad Gita Chapter I)]<br><br>([This where is the Bhagavad Gita proper starts. I have added the chapter<br>headings to aid in comparison with other translations, they are not part<br>of the original Ganguli text.&#8212;John Bruno Hare])<br><br>Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;"Assembled together on the sacred plain of<br>Kurukshetra from desire of fighting what did my sons and the Pandavas do.<br>O Sanjaya."<br><br>"Sanjaya said,&#8212;"Beholding the army of the Pandavas arrayed, king<br>Duryodhana, approaching the preceptor (Drona) said these words: Behold, O<br>preceptor, this vast army of the son of Pandu, arrayed by Drupada's son<br>(Dhrishtadyumna), thy intelligent disciple. There (in that army) are many<br>brave and mighty bowmen, who in battle are equal to Bhima and Arjuna.<br>(They are) Yuyudhana, and Virata, and that mighty car-warrior Drupada,<br>and Dhrishtaketu, and Chekitana, and the ruler of Kasi endued with great<br>energy; and Purujit, and Kuntibhoja, and Saivya that bull among men; and<br>Yudhamanyu of great prowess, and Uttamaujas of great energy; and<br>Subhadra's son, and the sons of Draupadi, all of whom are mighty<br>car-warriors. Hear, however, O best of regenerate ones, who are the<br>distinguished ones among us, the leader of army. I will name them to thee<br>for (thy) information. (They are) thyself, and Bhishma, and Karna, and<br>Kripa who is ever victorious; and Aswatthaman and Vikarna, and<br>Saumadatta, and Jayadratha.[124] Besides these, are many heroic warriors,<br>prepared to lay down their lives for my sake, armed with diverse kinds of<br>weapons, and all accomplished in battle. Our army, therefore, protected<br>by Bhishma, is insufficient. This force, however, of these (the<br>Pandavas), protected by Bhima, is sufficient.[125] Stationing yourselves<br>then in the entrances of the divisions that have been assigned to you,<br>all of you protect Bhishma alone.&#8212;(Just at this time) the valiant and<br>venerable grandsire of the Kurus, affording great joy to him (Duryodhana)<br>by loudly uttering a leonine roar, blew (his) conch. Then conches and<br>drums and cymbals and horns were sounded at once and the noise (made)<br>became a loud uproar. Then Madhava and Pandu's son (Arjuna), both<br>stationed on a great car unto which were yoked white steeds, blew their<br>celestial conches. And Hrishikesha blew (the conch called) Panchajanya<br>and Dhananjaya (that called) Devadatta; and Vrikodara of terrible deeds<br>blew the huge conch (called) Paundra. And Kunti's son king Yudhishthira<br>blew (the conch called) Anantavijaya; while Nakula and Sahadeva, (those<br>conches called respectively) Sughosa and Manipushpaka.[126] And that<br>splendid bowman, the ruler of Kasi and that mighty car-warrior,<br>Sikhandin, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, and that unvanquished Satyaki, and<br>Drupada, and the sons of Draupadi, and the mighty-armed son of<br>Subhadra&#8212;all these, O lord of earth, severally blew their conches. And<br>that blare, loudly reverberating through the welkin, and the earth, rent<br>the hearts of the Dhartarashtras. Then beholding the Dhartarashtra troops<br>drawn up, the ape-bannered son of Pandu, rising his bow, when, the<br>throwing of missiles had just commenced, said these words, O lord of<br>earth, to Hrishikesha.[127]<br><br>"Arjuna said,&#8212;'O thou that knoweth no deterioration, place my car (once)<br>between the two armies, so that I may observe these that stand here<br>desirous of battle, and with whom I shall have to contend in the labours<br>of this struggle.[128] I will observe those who are assembled here and<br>who are prepared to fight for doing what is agreeable in battle to the<br>evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra.'"<br><br>Sanjaya continued,&#8212;-'Thus addressed by Gudakesa, O Bharata, Hrishikesa,<br>placing that excellent car between the two armies, in view of Bhishma and<br>Drona and all the kings of the earth, said,&#8212;'Behold, O Partha these<br>assembled Kurus,&#8212;And there the son of Pritha beheld, standing (his)<br>sires and grandsons, and friends, and father-in-law and well-wishers, in<br>both the armies. Beholding all those kinsmen standing (there), the son of<br>Kunti, possessed by excessive pity, despondingly said (these words).<br><br>"Arjuna said,&#8212;'Beholding these kinsmen, O Krishna, assembled together<br>and eager for the fight, my limbs, become languid, and my mouth becomes<br>dry. My body trembles, and my hair stands on end. Gandiva slips from my<br>hand, and my skin burns. I am unable to stand (any longer); my mind seems<br>to wander. I behold adverse omens, too, O Kesava. I do not desire<br>victory, O Krishna, not sovereignty, nor pleasures. Of what use would<br>sovereignty be to us, O Govinda, or enjoyments, or even life, since they,<br>for whose sake sovereignty, enjoyments, and pleasures are desired by us,<br>are here arrayed for battle ready to give up life and wealth, viz.,<br>preceptors, sires, sons and grandsires, maternal uncles, father-in-laws,<br>grandsons, brother-in-laws, and kinsmen. I wish not to slay these though<br>they slay me, O slayer of Madhu, even for the sake of the sovereignty of<br>the three worlds, what then for the sake of (this) earth?[129] What<br>gratification can be ours, O Janardana, by slaying the Dhartarashtras?<br>Even if they be regarded as foes,[130] sin will overtake us if we slay<br>them. Therefore, it behoveth us not to slay the sons of Dhritarashtra who<br>are our own kinsmen.[131] How, O Madhava can we be happy by killing our<br>own kinsmen? Even if these, with judgments perverted by avarice, do not<br>see the evil that ariseth from the extermination of a race, and the sin<br>of internecine quarrels, why should not we, O Janarddana, who see the<br>evils of the extermination of a race, learn to abstain from that sin? A<br>race being destroyed, the eternal customs of that race are lost; and upon<br>those customs being lost, sin overpowers the whole race. From the<br>predominance of sin, O Krishna, the women of that race become corrupt.<br>And the women becoming corrupt, an intermingling of castes happeneth, O<br>descendant of Vrishni. This intermingling of castes leadeth to hell both<br>the destroyer of the race and the race itself. The ancestors of those<br>fall (from heaven), their rites of pinda and water ceasing. By these sins<br>of destroyers of races, causing intermixture of castes, the rules of<br>caste and the eternal rites of families become extinct. We have heard, O<br>Janarddana, that men whose family rites become extinct, ever dwell in<br>hell. Alas, we have resolved to perpetrate a great sin, for we are ready<br>to slay our own kinsmen from lust of the sweets of sovereignty. Better<br>would it be for me if the sons of Dhritarashtra, weapon in hand, should<br>in battle slay me (myself) unavenging unarmed.&#8212;'"<br><br>Sanjaya continued,&#8212;"Having spoken thus on the field of battle, Arjuna,<br>his mind troubled with grief, casting aside his bow and arrows, sat down<br>on his car."<br><br>[Here ends the first lesson entitled "Survey of Forces"[132] in the<br>dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna of the Bhagavadgita, the essence of<br>religion, the knowledge of Brahma, and the system of Yoga, comprised<br>within the Bhishma Parva of the Mahabharata of Vyasa containing one<br>hundred thousand verses.]
