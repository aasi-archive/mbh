                            Sanjaya said, "While they were battling, the Sun set, O Bharata, aid<br>there came the dreadful hour of twilight and the battle could no longer<br>be seen. Then king Yudhishthira, seeing that twilight had come and that<br>his own troops, slaughtered by Bhishma, had thrown aside their weapons,<br>and that stricken with fear, and turned off the field, they were seeking<br>to flee away, and beholding Bhishma also, that mighty car-warrior,<br>excited with wrath and afflicting everybody in fight, and noticing that<br>the mighty car-warriors of the Somakas, having been vanquished, had all<br>become cheerless, reflected a little, and then ordered the troops to be<br>withdrawn. Then king Yudhishthira withdrew his forces. And similarly, the<br>withdrawal of thy forces also took place at the same time. Then those<br>mighty car-warriors, O chief of the Kurus, having withdrawn their forces,<br>entered their tents, themselves mangled in battle. Afflicted by the<br>shafts of Bhishma and reflecting upon that hero's feats in battle, the<br>Pandavas obtained no peace of mind. Bhishma also, having vanquished the<br>Pandavas and the Srinjayas in battle, was worshipped by thy sons and<br>glorified by them, O Bharata. Accompanied by the rejoicing Kurus, he then<br>entered his tent. Night then set in, that deprives all creatures of their<br>senses. Then in that fierce hour of night, the Pandavas, the Vrishnis and<br>the invincible Srinjayas sat down for a consultation. All those mighty<br>persons, skilled in arriving at conclusions in council, coolly<br>deliberated about that which was beneficial for them in view of their<br>immediate circumstances. Then king Yudhishthira, having reflected for a<br>long while, said these words, casting his eyes on Vasudeva, 'Behold, O<br>Krishna, the high-souled Bhishma of fierce prowess. He crusheth my troops<br>like an elephant crushing a forest of reeds. We dare not even look at<br>that high-souled warrior. Like a raging conflagration he licketh up my<br>troops. The valiant Bhishma of keen weapons, when excited with wrath in<br>battle and bow in hand shooting his shafts, becometh as fierce as the<br>mighty Naga Takshaka of virulent poison. Indeed, the angry Yama is<br>capable of being vanquished, or even the chief of the celestials armed<br>with the thunder, or Varuna himself, noose in hand, or the Lord of the<br>Yakshas armed with mace. But Bhishma, excited with wrath, is incapable of<br>being vanquished in battle. When this is the case, O Krishna, I am,<br>through the weakness of my understanding, plunged in an ocean of grief<br>having got Bhishma (as a foe) in battle. I will retire into the woods, O<br>invincible one. My exile there would be for my benefit. Battle, O<br>Krishna, I no longer desire. Bhishma slayeth us always. As an insect, by<br>rushing into a blazing fire meeteth only with death, even so do I rush<br>upon Bhishma. In putting forth prowess, O thou of Vrishni's race, for the<br>sake of my kingdom, I am, alas, led to destruction. My brave brothers<br>have all been exceedingly afflicted with arrows. In consequence of the<br>affection they bear to myself their (eldest) brother they had to go into<br>the woods, deprived of kingdom. For myself alone, O slayer of Madhu, hath<br>Krishna been sunk into such distress. I regard life to be of high value.<br>Indeed, even life now seemeth to be difficult of being saved. (If I can<br>save that life), its latter remnant will I pass in the practice of<br>excellent virtue. If, with my brothers, O Kesava, I am worthy of thy<br>favour, tell me, O Krishna, what is for my benefit, without contravening<br>the duties of my order. Hearing these words of his, and (describing the<br>situation) in detail, Krishna, from compassion, said these words in reply<br>for comforting Yudhishthira, 'O son of Dharma, O thou that art firm in<br>truth, do thou not indulge in sorrow, thou that hast these invincible<br>heroes, these slayers of foes, for thy brothers. Arjuna and Bhimasena are<br>each endued with the energy of the Wind and the Fire. The twin sons of<br>Madri also are each as valiant as the Chief of the celestials himself.<br>From the good understanding that exists between us, do thou set me also<br>to this task. Even I, O son of Pandu, will fight with Bhishma. Directed<br>by thee, O great king, what is there that I may not do in great battle.<br>Challenging that bull among men, viz., Bhishma, I will slay him in<br>battle, in the very sight of the Dhartarashtras, if Phalguni doth not<br>wish to slay him. If, O son of Pandu, thou seest victory to be certain on<br>the slaughter of the heroic Bhishma, even, I, on a single car, will slay<br>that aged grandsire of the Kurus. Behold, O king, my prowess, equal to<br>that of the great Indra in battle. I will overthrow from his car that<br>warrior who always shooteth mighty weapons. He that is an enemy of the<br>sons of Pandu, without doubt, is my enemy also. They, that are yours, are<br>mine, and so they, that are mine, are yours. Thy brother (Arjuna) is my<br>friend, relative, and disciple. I will, O king, cut off my own flesh and<br>give it away for the sake of Arjuna. And this tiger among men also can<br>lay down his life for my sake. O sire, even this is our understanding,<br>viz., that we will protect each other. Therefore, command me, O king, in<br>what way I am to fight. Formerly, at Upaplavya, Partha had, in the<br>presence of many persons, vowed, saying, 'I will slay the son of Ganga.'<br>These words of the intelligent Partha should be observed (in practice).<br>Indeed, if Partha requests me without doubt I will fulfill that vow. Or,<br>let it be the task of Phalguni himself in battle. It is not heavy for<br>him. He will slay Bhishma, that subjugator of hostile cities. If excited<br>in battle, Partha can achieve feats that are incapable of being achieved<br>by others. Arjuna can slay in battle the very gods exerting themselves<br>actively, along with the Daityas and the Danavas. What need be said of<br>Bhishma, therefore, O king? Endued with great energy, Bhishma, the son of<br>Santanu, is now of perverted judgment, of intelligence decayed, and of<br>little sense, without doubt, he knoweth not what he should do.'<br><br>"Hearing these words of Krishna, Yudhishthira said, 'It is even so, O<br>thou of mighty arms, even as thou sayest, O thou of Madhu's race. All<br>these together are not competent to bear thy force. I am sure of always<br>having whatever I desire, when, O tiger among men, I have thyself staying<br>on my side. O foremost of victorious persons, I would conquer the very<br>gods with Indra at their head, when, O Govinda, I have thee for my<br>protector. What need I say, therefore, of Bhishma, though he is a mighty<br>car-warrior? But, O Krishna, I dare not, for my own glorification,<br>falsify thy words. Therefore, O Madhava, as promised before by thee,<br>render me aid without fighting for me. In this battle an agreement was<br>made by me with Bhishma. He said,&#8212;I will give thee counsel, but fight I<br>shall never for thee, since I shall have to fight for Duryodhana's sake.<br>Know this for truth. Therefore, O Lord, Bhishma may give me sovereignty<br>by giving me good counsel, O Madhava. Therefore, O slayer of Madhu, all<br>of us accompanied by thee, will once more repair unto Devavrata, for<br>asking him about the means of his own death. All of us then, O best of<br>persons, together going to Bhishma without delay, will speedily ask him<br>of Kuru's race his advice. O Janardana, he will truly give us beneficial<br>counsel; and O Krishna, I will do in battle what he will say. Of austere<br>vows, he will give us counsel, as also victory. We were children and<br>orphans. By him were we reared. O Madhava, him, our aged grandsire, I<br>wish to day,&#8212;him, the sire of our sire. Oh, fie upon the profession of a<br>Kshatriyas.'<br><br>Sanjaya continued, "Hearing these words, O king, he of Vrishni's race<br>said unto Yudhishthira, 'O thou of great wisdom, these words of thine, O<br>king, are to my taste. Bhishma, otherwise called Devavrata, is skilled in<br>weapons. With only his glances he can consume the foe. Repair unto that<br>son of the Ocean-going (Ganga), for asking him about the means of his<br>death. Asked by thee, in particular, he will certainly say the truth. We<br>will, therefore, proceed for questioning the Kuru grandsire. Repairing<br>unto the reverend son of Santanu, we will, O Bharata, ask him his advice<br>and according to the advice that he will give us we will fight with the<br>foe.' Having thus deliberated, O elder brother of Pandu, the heroic sons<br>of Pandu, and the valiant Vasudeva, all proceeded together towards the<br>abode of Bhishma, casting aside their coats of mail and weapons and<br>entering then his tent, they all bowed to him, bending their heads. And<br>the sons of Pandu, O king, worshipping that bull of Bharata's race, and<br>bowing unto him with their heads, sought his protection. The Kuru<br>grandsire, the mighty-armed Bhishma, then addressed them, saying,<br>'Welcome art thou, O thou of Vrishni's race. Welcome art thou, O<br>Dhananjaya. Welcome to thee, O king Yudhishthira the just, Ad to thee, O<br>Bhima. Welcome to you also, ye twins. What am I to do now for enhancing<br>your joy? Even if it be exceedingly difficult of achievement, I will yet<br>do it with all my soul. Unto the son of Ganga who thus repeatedly spoke<br>unto them with such affection, king Yudhishthira, with a cheerful heart,<br>lovingly said, these words, 'O thou that art conversant with everything,<br>how shall we obtain victory, and how shall we acquire sovereignty? How<br>also may this destruction of creatures be stopped? Say all these unto me,<br>O lord. Tell us the means of thy own death. How, O hero, shall we be able<br>to bear thee in battle? O grandsire of the Kurus, thou givest not thy<br>foes even a minute hole to pick in thee. Thou art seen in battle with thy<br>bow ever drawn to a circle. When thou takest thy shafts, when aimest<br>them, and when drawest the bow (for letting them off), no one is able to<br>mark. O slayer of hostile heroes, constantly smiting (as thou dost) cars<br>and steeds and men and elephants, we behold thee on thy car, O<br>mighty-armed one, to resemble a second Sun. What man is there, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, who can venture to vanquish thee, scattering showers of<br>arrows in battle, and causing a great destruction. Tell me, O grandsire,<br>the means by which we may vanquish thee in battle, by which sovereignty<br>may be ours, and lastly, by which my army may not have to undergo such<br>destruction. Hearing these words, Santanu's son, O elder brother of<br>Pandu, said unto the son of Pandu, 'As long as I am alive, O son of<br>Kunti, victory cannot be yours in battle, O thou of great wisdom. Truly<br>do I say this unto thee. After, however, I am vanquished in fight, ye may<br>have victory in battle, ye sons of Pandu. If, therefore, ye desire<br>victory in the battle, smite me down without delay. I give you<br>permission, ye sons of Pritha, strike me as ye please. I am thus known to<br>you in what I regard to be a fortunate circumstance.[472] After I am<br>slain, all the rest will be slain. Therefore, do as I bid'.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Tell us the means by which we may vanquish thee in<br>battle, thee that art, when excited with wrath in the fight, like unto<br>the Destroyer himself armed with mace. The wielder of the thunder-bolt<br>may be vanquished or Varuna, or Yama. Thou, however, art incapable of<br>being defeated in battle by even the gods and Asuras united together,<br>with Indra at their head.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'That, O son of Pandu, is true, which thou sayest. O thou,<br>of mighty arms. When with weapons and my large bow in hand I contend<br>carefully in battle, I am incapable of being defeated by the very gods<br>and the Asuras with Indra at their head. If, however, I lay aside my<br>weapons, even these car-warriors can slay me. One that hath thrown away<br>his weapons, one that hath fallen down, one whose armour hath slipped<br>off, one whose standard is down, one who is flying away, one who is<br>frightened, one who says&#8212;I am thine&#8212;one who is a female, one who<br>beareth the name of a female, one no longer capable of taking care of<br>one's self, one who hath only a single son, or one who is a vulgar<br>fellows,&#8212;with these I do not like to battle. Hear also, O king, about my<br>resolve formed before. Beholding any inauspicious omen I would never<br>fight. That mighty car-warrior, the son of Drupada, O king, whom thou<br>hast in thy army, who is known by the name of Sikhandin, who is wrathful<br>in battle, brave, and ever victorious, was a female before but<br>subsequently obtained manhood. How all this took place, ye all know it<br>truly. Brave in battle and clad in mail, let Arjuna, keeping Sikhandin<br>before him, attack me with his sharp shafts. When that inauspicious omen<br>will be there, especially in the form of one that was a female before, I<br>will never seek, though armed with bow and arrow, to strike him.<br>Obtaining that opportunity, let Dhananjaya the son of Pandu quickly<br>pierce me on every side with his shafts, O bull of Bharata's race. Except<br>the highly blessed Krishna, and Dhananjaya the son of Pandu, I do not<br>behold the person in the three worlds who is able to slay me while<br>exerting myself in battle. Let Vibhatsu, therefore, armed with weapons,<br>struggling carefully in battle, with his excellent bow in hand, placing<br>(Sikhandin or) something else before, throw, me down (from my car). Then<br>the victory will be certain. Do this, O great king, even this that I have<br>said unto thee, O thou of excellent vows. Thou wilt then be able to slay<br>all Dhartarashtras assembled together in battle.'<br><br>Sanjaya continued, "The Parthas then, having ascertained all this went<br>back to their tents, saluting the Kuru grandsire, viz., the high-souled<br>Bhishma. After Ganga's son, prepared to go to the other world, had said<br>this, Arjuna. burning with grief and his face suffused in shame, said<br>these words, 'How, O Madhava, shall I fight in battle with the grandsire<br>who is my senior in years, who is possessed of wisdom and intelligence,<br>and who is the oldest member of our race? While sporting in days of<br>childhood, O Vasudeva, I used to smear the body of this high-souled and<br>illustrious one with dust by climbing on his lap with my own filthy body.<br>O elder brother of Gada, he is the sire of my sire Pandu. While a child,<br>climbing on the lap of this high-souled one I once called him father, I<br>am not thy father but thy father's father, O Bharata!&#8212;even this is what<br>he said to me (in reply) in my childhood. He who said so, Oh, how can he<br>be slain by me. O, let my army perish. Whether, it is victory or death<br>that I obtain I will never fight that high-souled person. (Even this is<br>what I think). What dost thou think, O Krishna!'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'Having vowed the slaughter of Bhishma before, O Jishnu,<br>how canst thou abstain from slaying him, agreeably to the duties of a<br>Kshatriya? Throw down from his car, O Partha, that Kshatriya who is<br>invincible in battle. Victory can never be yours without slaying Ganga's<br>son. Even thus shall he go to the abode of Yama. This hath been settled<br>before by the gods. That which hath been destined before, O Partha, must<br>happen. It cannot be otherwise. None save thee, O invincible one, not<br>even the wielder of the thunder-bolt himself, would be capable of<br>fighting with Bhishma, who is like the Destroyer with wide-open mouth.<br>Slay Bhishma, without any anxiety. Listen also to these words of mine<br>that are what Vrihaspati of great intelligence had said unto Sakra in<br>days of old. One should slay even an aged person endued with every merit<br>and worthy of reverence if he cometh as a foe, or, indeed any other who<br>approacheth for destroying one's self&#8212;O Dhananjaya, this is the eternal<br>duty sanctioned for the Kshatriya, viz., that they should fight, protect<br>subjects, and perform sacrifices, all without malice.'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'Sikhandin, O Krishna, will certainly be the cause of<br>Bhishma's death, for Bhishma, as soon as he beholds the prince of the<br>Panchalas, abstains from striking. Therefore, keeping Sikhandin before<br>him and at our head, we will, by that means, overthrow the son of Ganga.<br>Even this is what I think. I will hold in check other great bowmen with<br>my shafts. As regards Sikhandin, he will fight with Bhishma alone, that<br>foremost of all warriors. I have heard from that chief of the Kurus that<br>he would not strike Sikhandin, for having been born before as a woman he<br>subsequently became a male person.'<br><br>Sanjaya continued, "Having settled this with Bhishma's permission, the<br>Pandavas, along with Madhava, went away with rejoicing hearts. And then<br>those bulls among men retired to their respective beds."
