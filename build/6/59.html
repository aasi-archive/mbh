                            Dhritarashtra said, "After that dreadful vow had been made in battle by<br>Bhishma enraged by the words of my son, what, O Sanjaya, did Bhishma do<br>unto the sons of Pandu or what did the Panchalas do unto the grandsire?<br>Tell it all unto me, O Sanjaya."<br><br>Sanjaya said, "After the forenoon of that day, O Bharata, had passed<br>away, and the sun in his westward course had passed a portion of his<br>path, and after the high-souled Pandavas had won the victory, thy sire<br>Devavrata, conversant with the distinction of all codes of morality,<br>rushed carried by the fleetest steeds, towards the army of the Pandavas,<br>protected by a large force and by all thy sons. Then, O Bharata, in<br>consequence of thy sinful policy, commenced a dreadful battle, making the<br>hair stand on end, between ourselves and the Pandavas. And the twang of<br>bows, the flapping of bowstrings against the leathern fences (casing the<br>hands of the bowman), mingling together, made a loud uproar resembling<br>that of splitting hills. Stay&#8212;Here I stand,&#8212;Know this one,&#8212;Turn<br>back,&#8212;Stand,&#8212;I wait for thee&#8212;Strike,&#8212;these were the words heard<br>everywhere. And the sound of falling coats of mail made of gold, of<br>crowns and diadems, and of standards resembled the sound of falling<br>stones on a stony ground. And heads, and arms decked with ornaments,<br>falling by hundreds and thousands upon the ground moved in convulsions.<br>And some brave combatants, with heads severed from their trunks,<br>continued to stand weapons in grasp or armed with drawn bow. And a<br>dreadful river of blood began to flow there, of impetuous current, miry<br>with flesh and blood, and with the bodies of (dead) elephants for its<br>(sub-aqueous) rocks. Flowing from the bodies of steeds, men, and<br>elephants, and delightful to vultures and jackals, it ran towards the<br>ocean represented by the next world. A battle such as that, O king, which<br>(then) took place between thy sons, O Bharata, and the Pandavas, was<br>never seen or heard before. And in consequence of the bodies of<br>combatants slain in that conflict, cars could not make their way. And the<br>field of battle in consequence of the bodies of slain elephants seemed to<br>be strewn over with blue crests of hills. And the field of battle, strewn<br>with variegated coats of mail and turbans, O sire, looked beautiful like<br>the firmament autumn. And some combatants were seen who, though severely<br>wounded, yet rushed cheerfully and proudly upon the foe in battle. And<br>many, fallen on the field of battle, cried aloud, saying&#8212;'O father, O<br>brother, O friend, O kinsman, O companion, O maternal uncle, do not<br>abandon me.'&#8212;And others cried aloud, saying,&#8212;'Come! Come thou here! Why<br>art thou frightened? Where dost thou go? I stand in battle, do not be<br>afraid.' And in that combat Bhishma, the son of Santanu, with bow<br>incessantly drawn to a circle, shot shafts of blazing points, resembling<br>snakes of virulent poison. And shooting continuous line of arrows in all<br>directions, that hero of rigid vows smote the Pandava car-warriors naming<br>each beforehand, O Bharata. And displaying his extreme lightness of<br>hands, and dancing (as it were) along the track of his car, he seemed, O<br>king, to be present everywhere like a circle of fire. And in consequence<br>of the lightness of his movements, the Pandavas in that battle, along<br>with the Srinjayas, beheld that hero, though really alone, as multiplied<br>a thousand-fold. And every one there regarded Bhishma as having<br>multiplied his self by illusion. Having seen him now on the east, the<br>next moment they saw him on the west. And so having seen him on the<br>north, the next moment they saw him on the south. And the son of Ganga<br>was thus seen fighting in that battle. And there was no one amongst the<br>Pandavas capable of even looking at him. What they all saw were only the<br>innumerable shafts shot from his bow. And heroic warriors, beholding him<br>achieve such feats in battle, and (thus) slaughtering their ranks,<br>uttered many lamentations. And, kings in thousands came in contact with<br>thy sire, thus coursing over the field in a superhuman way, and fell upon<br>that fire represented by the enraged Bhishma like flights of senseless<br>insects (upon a blazing fire) for their own destruction. Not a single<br>shaft of that light-handed warrior was futile, falling upon the bodies of<br>men, elephants, and steeds, in consequence of the numbers (opposed to<br>him). With a single straight shaft shot in that battle, he despatched a<br>single elephant like hill riven by the thunderbolt. Two or three<br>elephant-riders at a time, cased in mail and standing together, thy sire<br>pierced with one shaft of sharp point. Whoever approached Bhishma, that<br>tiger among men, in battle, seen for a moment was, next beheld to fall<br>down on the ground. And that vast host of king Yudhishthira the just,<br>thus slaughtered by Bhishma of incomparable prowess, gave way in a<br>thousand directions. And afflicted with that arrowy shower, the vast army<br>began to tremble in the very presence of Vasudeva and the high-souled<br>Partha. And although the heroic leaders of the Pandava army made great<br>efforts, yet they could not check the flight of (even) the great<br>car-warriors of their side afflicted with the shafts of Bhishma. The<br>prowess, in consequence of which that vast army was routed, was equal to<br>that of the chief of the gods himself. And that army was so completely<br>routed, O great king, that no two persons could be seen together. And<br>cars and elephants and steeds were pierced all over, and standards and<br>shafts of cars were strewn over the field. And the army of the sons of<br>Pandu uttered cries of oh and alas, and became deprived of senses. And<br>the sire struck the son and the son struck the sire; and friend<br>challenged the dearest of friends to battle as if under the influence of<br>fate. And others amongst the combatants of Pandu's son were seen, O<br>Bharata, to run away, throwing aside their coats of mail, and with<br>dishevelled hair. And the army of the sons of Pandu, indulging in loud<br>wails, including the very leaders of their best of car-warriors, was seen<br>to be as confounded as a very herd of kine. The delighter of the Yadavas<br>then, beholding that army thus routed, said unto Partha, stopping that<br>best of cars (which he guided), these words, 'The hour is now come, O<br>Partha, which was desired by thee. Strike Bhishma, O tiger among men,<br>else, thou wilt lose the senses. O hero, formerly, in the conclave of<br>kings, thou hadst said,&#8212;'I will slay all the warriors of Dhritarashtra's<br>sons, headed by Bhishma and Drona&#8212;all in fact, who will fight with me in<br>battle'. O son of Kunti, O chastiser of foes, make those words of thine<br>true. Behold, O Vibhatsu, this army of thine is being routed on all<br>sides. Behold, the kings in Yudhishthira's host are all flying away,<br>seeing Bhishma in battle, who looketh like the Destroyer himself with<br>wide-open mouth. Afflicted with fear, they are making themselves scarce<br>like the weaker animals at sight of the lion. Thus addressed, Dhananjaya<br>replied unto Vasudeva, saying, 'Plunging through this sea of the hostile<br>host, urge on the steeds to where Bhishma is. I will throw down that<br>invincible warrior, the reverend Kuru grandsire'. Then Madhava urged<br>those steeds of silvery hue to where, O king, the car of Bhishma was,<br>that car which, like the very sun, was incapable of being gazed at. And<br>beholding the mighty-armed Partha thus rushing to an encounter with<br>Bhishma, the mighty army of Yudhisthira rallied for battle. Then Bhishma,<br>that foremost of warriors amongst the Kurus, repeatedly roaring like a<br>lion, quickly covered Dhananjaya's car with an arrowy shower. In a moment<br>that car of his, with standard and charioteer, became invisible, shrouded<br>with that arrowy downpour. Vasudeva, however, endued with great might<br>fearlessly and summoning all his patience, began to guide those steeds<br>mangled by Bhishma's shafts. Then Partha, taking up his celestial bow<br>whose twang resembled the roar of the clouds, caused Bhishma's bow to<br>drop down, cutting it off with his keen shafts. The Kuru warrior, thy<br>sire, seeing his bow cut off, took up another and stringed it within the<br>twinkling of the eye. And he stretched that bow whose twang resembled the<br>roar of the clouds, with his two hands. But Arjuna, excited with wrath,<br>cut off that bow also of his. Then the son of Santanu applauded that<br>lightness of hand (displayed by Arjuna), saying&#8212;Excellent, O Partha, O<br>thou of mighty arms, excellent, O son of Pandu. O Dhananjaya, such a<br>mighty feat is, indeed, worthy of thee. I have been pleased with thee.<br>Fight hard with  me, O son. And having applauded Partha thus, and taking<br>up another large bow, that hero shot his shafts at Partha's car. And<br>Vasudeva then displayed his great skill in the guiding of chariot, for he<br>baffled those shafts of his, by guiding the car in quick circles. Then, O<br>sire, Bhishma with great strength pierced both Vasudeva and Dhananjaya<br>with keen shafts all over their bodies. And mangled by those shafts of<br>Bhishma, those two tigers among men looked like two roaring bulls with<br>the scratches of horns on their bodies. And once again, excited with<br>rage, Bhishma covered the two Krishnas on all sides with shafts in<br>hundreds and thousands. And with those keen shafts of his, the enraged<br>Bhishma caused him of Vrishni's race to shiver. And laughing loudly he<br>also made Krishna to wonder. Then the mighty-armed Krishna, beholding the<br>prowess of Bhishma in battle as also the mildness with which Arjuna<br>fought, and seeing that Bhishma was creating incessant showers of arrows<br>in that conflict and looked like the all-consuming Sun himself in the<br>midst of the two armies, and marking besides, that that hero was slaying<br>the foremost of combatants in Yudhishthira's host and causing a havoc in<br>that army as if the hour of dissolution had come,&#8212;the adorable Kesava,<br>that slayer of hosts, endued with immeasurable soul&#8212;unable to bear what<br>he saw, thought that Yudhishthira's army could not survive that<br>slaughter.&#8212;In a single day Bhishma can slaughter all the Daityas and the<br>Danavas. With how much ease then can he slay in battle the sons of Pandu<br>with all their troops and followers. The vast army of the illustrious son<br>of Pandu is again flying away. And the Kauravas also beholding the<br>Somakas routed, are rushing to battle cheerfully, gladdening the<br>grandsire. Accoutred in mail, even I will stay Bhishma to-day for the<br>sake of the Pandavas. This burthen of the high-souled Pandavas even I<br>will lighten. As regards Arjuna, though struck in battle with keen<br>shafts, he knoweth not what he should do, from respect for Bhishma,&#8212;And<br>while Krishna was reflecting thus the grandsire, excited with wrath, once<br>again shot his shafts at Partha's car. And in consequence of very great<br>number of those arrows all the points of the compass became entirely<br>shrouded. And neither the welkin nor the quarters nor the earth nor the<br>sun himself of brilliant rays, could be seen. And the winds that blew<br>seemed to be mixed with smoke, and all the points of the compass seemed<br>to be agitated. And Drona, and Vikarna, and Jayadratha, and Bhurisrava,<br>and Kritavarman, and Kripa, and Srutayush and the ruler of the Amvashtas<br>and Vinda and Anuvinda, Sudakshina and the westerners, and the diverse<br>tribes of the Sauviras, the Vasatis, and the Kshudrakas, and the Malavas,<br>all these, at the command of the royal son of Santanu, quickly approached<br>Kiritin for battle. And the grandson of Sini saw that Kiritin was<br>surrounded by many hundreds of horse, and infantry, and cars, and mighty<br>elephants. And beholding both Vasudeva and Arjuna thus encompassed by<br>infantry and elephants and horses and cars, on all sides, that foremost<br>of all bearers of arms, viz., the chief of the Sinis, quickly proceeded<br>to that spot. And that foremost of bowmen, the chief of the Sinis,<br>quickly rushing at those troops, came to Arjuna's side like Vishnu coming<br>to the aid of the slayer of Vritra. And that foremost warrior of Sini's<br>race cheerfully said unto Yudhishthira's host all the combatants of which<br>had been frightened by Bhishma and whose elephants, steeds, cars, and<br>numberless standards had been mangled and broken into pieces, and which<br>was flying away from the field, these words, 'Ye Kshatriyas, where do ye<br>go? This is not the duty of the righteous as hath been declared by the<br>ancients. Ye foremost of heroes, do not violate your pledges. Observe<br>your own duties as heroes'. Beholding that those foremost of kings were<br>flying together from the field of battle, and marking the mildness with<br>which Partha fought, and beholding also that Bhishma was exerting himself<br>very powerfully in battle, and that the Kurus were rushing from all<br>sides, the younger brother of Vasava, the high-souled protector of all<br>the Dasarhas, unable to bear it all, addressed the renowned grandson of<br>Sini, and applauding him, said,&#8212;'O hero of Sini's race, they that are<br>retreating, are, indeed, retreating. They that are yet staying, O thou of<br>the Satwata race, let them also go away. Behold, I will soon throw<br>Bhishma down from his car, and Drona also in battle, with all their<br>followers. There is none in the Kuru host, O thou of the Satwata race,<br>who is able to escape my angry self. Therefore, taking up my fierce<br>discus, I will slay Bhishma of high vows. And slaying in battle those two<br>foremost of car-warriors, viz., Bhishma along with his followers and<br>Drona also, O grandson of Sini, I will gladden Dhananjaya, and the king,<br>and Bhima, and the twin Aswins. And slaying all the sons of Dhritarashtra<br>and all those foremost of kings who have embraced their side, I will<br>joyfully furnish king Ajatasatru with a kingdom today.' Saying this,<br>Vasudeva's son, abandoning (the reins of) the steeds, jumped down from<br>the car, whirling with his (right) arm his discus of beautiful nave with<br>edge sharp as a razor, effulgent as the sun and possessed of force equal<br>to that of a thousand bolts of heaven. And making the earth tremble under<br>his tread, the high-souled Krishna rushed impetuously towards Bhishma.<br>And that grinder of foes, the younger brother of the chief of the gods,<br>excited with wrath, rushed towards Bhishma staying in the midst of his<br>troops, like a lion from desire of slaying upon a prince of elephants<br>blinded with fury and staying proudly for the attack. And the end of his<br>yellow garments waving in the air looked like a cloud charged with<br>lightning in the sky. And that lotus of a discus called Sudarsana, having<br>for its stalk the beautiful arm of Saurin, looked as beautiful as the<br>primeval lotus, bright as the morning sun, which sprung from the navel of<br>Narayana. And Krishna's wrath was the morning sun that caused that lotus<br>to blow. And the beautiful leaves of that lotus were as sharp as the edge<br>of a razor. And Krishna's body was the beautiful lake, and his (right)<br>arm the stalk springing therefrom, upon which that lotus shone. And<br>beholding the younger brother of Mahendra, excited with wrath and roaring<br>loudly and armed with that discus, all creatures set out a loud wail,<br>thinking that the destruction of the Kurus was at hand. And armed with<br>his discus Vasudeva looked like the Samvarta fire that appears at the end<br>of the Yuga for consuming the world. And the preceptor of the universe<br>blazed up like a fierce comet risen for consuming all creatures. And<br>beholding that foremost of bipeds, that divine personage, advancing armed<br>with the discus, Santanu's son stationed on his car, bow and arrow in<br>hand, fearlessly said, 'Come, Come, O Lord of the gods, O thou that hast<br>the universe for thy abode. I bow to thee, O thou that art armed with<br>mace, sword and Saranga. O lord of the universe, forcibly throw me down<br>from this excellent car, O thou that art the refuge of all creatures in<br>this battle. Slain here by thee, O Krishna, great will be my good fortune<br>both in this world and the next. Great is the respect thou payest me, O<br>Lord of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas. My dignity will be celebrated in<br>the three worlds.' Hearing these words of Santanu's son, Krishna rushing<br>impetuously towards him said, 'Thou art the root of this great slaughter<br>on earth. Thou wilt behold Duryodhana slain to-day. A wise minister who<br>treadeth in the path of righteousness should restrain a king that is<br>addicted to the evil of gambling. That wretch again of his race who<br>transgresseth duty should be abandoned as one whose intelligence hath<br>been misdirected by destiny.&#8212;The royal Bhishma, hearing these words,<br>replied unto the chief of the Yadus, saying,&#8212;Destiny is all powerful.<br>The Yadus, for their benefit, had abandoned Kansa. I said this to the<br>king (Dhritarashtra) but he minded it not. The listener that hath no<br>benefit to receive becometh, for (his own) misery, of perverted<br>understanding through (the influence of destiny).' Meanwhile, jumping<br>down from his car, Partha, himself of massive and long arms, quickly ran<br>on foot after that chief of Yadu's race possessed of massive and long<br>arms, and seized him by his two hands. That first of all gods devoted in<br>self, Krishna, was excited with rage. And therefore, though thus seized,<br>Vishnu forcibly dragged Jishnu after him, like a tempest bearing away a<br>single tree. The high-souled Partha, however, seizing them with great<br>force his legs as he was proceeding at a quick pace towards Bhishma,<br>succeeded, O king, in stopping him with difficulty at the tenth step. And<br>when Krishna stopped, decked as he was with a beautiful garland of gold,<br>cheerfully bowed down to him and said, 'Quell this wrath of thine. Thou<br>art the refuge of the Pandavas, O Kesava. I swear, O Kesava, by my sons<br>and uterine brothers that I will not withdraw from the acts to which I<br>have pledged myself. O younger brother of Indra, at thy command I will<br>certainly annihilate the Kurus.' Hearing that promise and oath of his,<br>Janardana became gratified. And ever engaged as he was in doing what was<br>agreeable to Arjuna&#8212;that best of the Kurus.&#8212;he once more, discus on<br>arm, mounted on his car. And that slayer of foes once more took up those<br>reins (that he had abandoned), and taking up his conch called<br>Panchajanya, Saurin filled all the points of the compass and the welkin<br>with its blare. And thereupon beholding Krishna decked with necklace and<br>Angada and ear-rings, with curved eye-lashes smeared with dust, and with<br>teeth of perfect whiteness, once more take up his conch the Kuru heroes<br>uttered a loud cry. And the sound of cymbals and drums and kettle-drums,<br>and the rattle of car-wheels and the noise of smaller drums, mingling<br>with those leonine shouts, set forth from all the ranks of the Kurus,<br>became a fierce uproar. And the twang of Partha's Gandiva, resembling the<br>roll of the thunder, filled the welkin and all the quarters. And shot<br>from the bow of Pandu's son, bright and blazing shafts proceeded in all<br>directions. Then the Kuru king, with a large force, and with Bhishma and<br>Bhurisravas also, arrow in hand, and resembling a comet risen for<br>consuming a constellation, rushed against him. And Bhurisravas hurled at<br>Arjuna seven javelins furnished with wings of gold, and Duryodhana a<br>lance of fierce impetuosity, and Salya a mace, and Santanu's son a dart.<br>Thereupon, Arjuna, baffling with seven shafts the seven javelins, fleet<br>as arrows, shot by Bhurisravas, cut off with another keen-edged shaft the<br>lance hurled from Duryodhana's arm. And the blazing dart coming towards<br>him&#8212;effulgent as lightning&#8212;hurled by Santanu's son, and the mace hurled<br>from the arm of the ruler of the Madras, that hero cut off with two<br>(other) shafts. Then drawing with his two hands and with great force his<br>beautiful bow Gandiva of immeasurable energy, he invoked with proper<br>mantras the highly wonderful and terrible Mahendra weapon and caused it<br>to appear in the welkin. And with that mighty weapon producing profuse<br>showers of arrows endued with the effulgence of the blazing fire, that<br>high-souled and mighty bowman, decked with diadem and garland of gold,<br>checked the entire Kaurava host. And those shafts from Partha's bow,<br>cutting off the arms, bows, standard-tops, and cars, penetrated into the<br>bodies of the kings and of the huge elephants and steeds of the foe. And<br>filling the cardinal and the subsidiary directions with those sharp and<br>terrible shafts of his, Pritha's son decked with diadem and garland of<br>gold, agitated the hearts of his foes by means of the twang of Gandiva.<br>And in that awful passage at arms, the blare of conches and beat of drums<br>and the deep rattle of cars were all silenced by the twang of Gandiva.<br>And ascertaining that twang to be of Gandiva, king Virata and other<br>heroes among men, and the brave Drupada, the king of the Panchalas, all<br>proceeded to that spot with undepressed hearts. And all thy combatants<br>stood, struck with fear, each at the spot where he heard that twang of<br>Gandiva. And none amongst them ventured to proceed to that place whence<br>that sound was heard. And in that awful slaughter of kings, heroic<br>combatants were slain and car-warriors with those that guided their cars.<br>And elephants with resplendent housings of gold and gorgeous standards<br>(on their backs), afflicted with broad-headed shafts failing upon them,<br>suddenly fell down, deprived of life and their bodies mangled by Kiritin.<br>And forcibly struck by Partha with his winged arrows of great impetuosity<br>and broad-headed shafts of keen-edge and points, the standards of<br>innumerable kings stationed at the heads of their yantras and Indrajalas<br>were cut off.[372] And bands of infantry and car-warriors, in that<br>battle, and steeds and elephants, fell fast on the field, their limbs<br>paralysed, or themselves speedily deprived of life, affected by<br>Dhananjaya with those shafts. And, O king, many were the warriors who in<br>that terrible conflict had their coats of mail and bodies cut through by<br>that mighty weapon called after the name of Indra. And with those<br>terrible and sharp shafts of his, Kiritin caused an awful river to run on<br>the field of battle, having for its waters the blood flowing from the<br>mangled bodies of the combatants and having for its froth their fat. And<br>its current was broad and ran fiercely. And the bodies of elephants and<br>steeds despatched to the other world formed its banks. And its mire<br>consisted of the entrails, the marrow, and the flesh of human beings, and<br>prodigious Rakshasas formed the (tall) trees (standing on its banks). And<br>the crowns of human heads in profusion, covered with hair, formed its<br>(floating) mess, and heaps of human bodies, forming its sandbanks, caused<br>the current to flow in a thousand directions. And the coats of mail<br>strewn all over formed its hard pebbles. And its banks were infested by<br>large number of jackals and wolves and cranes and vultures and crowds of<br>Rakshasas, and packs of hyenas. And they that were alive beheld that<br>terrible river of current consisting of fat, marrow, and blood, caused by<br>the arrowy showers of Arjuna&#8212;that embodiment of (man's) cruelty&#8212;to look<br>like the great Vaitarani.[373] And beholding the foremost warriors of<br>that army of the Kurus thus slain by Phalguni, the Chedis, the Panchalas,<br>the Kurushas, the Matsyas, and all the combatants of the Pandava side,<br>those foremost of men, elated with victory, together set up a loud shout<br>for frightening the Kaurava warriors. And they uttered that cry<br>indicative of victory, beholding the foremost combatants of the (Kuru)<br>army, the very troops protected by mighty leaders of divisions, thus<br>slain by Kiritin, that terror of foes, who frightened them like a lion<br>frightening herds of smaller animals. And then the bearer of Gandiva<br>himself, and Janardana both filled with delight, uttered loud roars. And<br>the Kurus, with Bhishma, and Drona and Duryodhana and Valhika,<br>exceedingly mangled by the weapons (of Arjuna), beholding the sun<br>withdraw his rays, and seeing also that awful and irresistible weapon<br>called after the name of Indra spread out and causing (as it were) the<br>end of the Yuga to appear, withdraw their forces for the nightly rest.<br>And that foremost of men, Dhananjaya also, having achieved a great feat<br>and won great renown by crushing his foes, and beholding the sun assume a<br>red hue and the evening twilight to set in, and having completed his<br>work, retired with his uterine brothers to the camp for nightly rest.<br>Then when darkness was about to set in, there arose among the Kuru troops<br>a great and terrible uproar. And all said, 'In today's battle Arjuna hath<br>slain ten thousand car-warriors, and full seven hundred elephants. And<br>all the westerners, and the diverse tribes of the Sauviras, and the<br>Kshudrakas and the Malavas, have all been slain. The feat achieved by<br>Dhananjaya is a mighty one. None else is competent to achieve it.<br>Srutayush, the ruler of the Amvashtas, and Durmarshana, and Chitrasena,<br>and Drona, and Kripa, and the ruler of the Sindhus, and Valhika, and<br>Bhurisravas, and Salya, and Sala, O king, and other warriors by hundreds<br>united together, along with Bhishma himself, have on battle, by the<br>prowess of his own arms, been vanquished today by the angry son of<br>Pritha, viz., Kiritin, that one mighty car-warrior in the world.' Talking<br>thus, O Bharata, all the warriors of thy side went to their tents from<br>the field of battle. And all the combatants of the Kuru army frightened<br>by Kiritin, then entered their tents illumined by thousands of torches,<br>and beautified by innumerable lamps.
