                            Sanjaya said, "Then those heroes, O king, who cherished feelings of<br>hostility towards one another, retired to their tents, their persons<br>covered with blood. Having rested for a while agreeably to rule, and<br>praising one another (for the feats of the day), they were again seen<br>clad in mail, desirous of battle. Then thy son, O king, overwhelmed with<br>anxiety and covered with blood trickling down (from his wounds), asked<br>the grandsire, saying.[406] 'Our troops are fierce and terrible and carry<br>innumerable standards. They are, again, arrayed properly. Yet the brave<br>and mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas, having penetrated (into our<br>array) and afflicted and slaughtered (our troops), escaped unhurt.[407]<br>Confounding us all, they have won great fame in battle. Bhima again,<br>having penetrated into our Makara array which was strong as the<br>thunder-bolt, afflicted me with his terrible shafts each resembling the<br>rod of Death. Beholding him excited with wrath, O king, I was deprived of<br>my senses. Even now I cannot regain my peace of mind. Through thy grace,<br>O thou that art firm in truth, I desire to obtain victory and slay the<br>sons of Pandu.' Thus addressed by him, the high-souled son of Ganga, that<br>foremost of all wielders of weapons, endued with great mental energy,<br>understanding that Duryodhana was possessed by grief replied unto him,<br>laughing the while though cheerless, saying,[408] 'Penetrating into<br>(their) army with the utmost exertions and with my whole soul, O prince,<br>I wish to give thee victory and joy. For thy sake I do not at all<br>dissemble. They that have become the allies of the Pandavas in this<br>battle are fierce and numerous. Mighty car-warriors of great renown, they<br>are exceedingly brave and accomplished in arms. Incapable of being<br>fatigued, they vomit forth their wrath. Cherishing feelings of animosity<br>towards thee, and swelling with prowess, they are not capable of being<br>defeated easily. I will, however, O king, contend against those heroes<br>with my whole soul and throwing away my very life. For thy sake, in<br>battle, O thou of great glory, my life itself shall today be recklessly<br>exposed. For thy sake I would consume all the worlds with the celestials<br>and the Daityas, let alone thy foes here. I will, O king, fight with<br>those Pandavas, and do all that is agreeable to thee. Hearing these<br>words, Duryodhana became inspired with great confidence and his heart was<br>filled with delight. And cheerfully he ordered all the troops, and all<br>the kings, (in his army) saying, Advance. And at that command, O king,<br>his army consisting of cars, steeds, foot-soldiers, and elephants, began<br>to advance. And that large force. O king, armed with diverse kinds of<br>weapons, was exceedingly cheerful. And that army of thine, O monarch,<br>consisting of elephants, steeds, and foot-soldiers, on the field of<br>battle, looked exceedingly beautiful. And huge tuskers, stationed in<br>large bodies, and skilfully urged, looked resplendent on the field all<br>around. And many royal combatants accomplished in diverse weapons were<br>seen in the midst of thy troops. And the dust, red as the morning sun,<br>raised by those cars and foot-soldiers and elephants and steeds in large<br>bodies as they were duly moved over the field, looked beautiful,<br>shrouding the rays of the sun. And the many-coloured banners stationed on<br>cars and elephants, waving in the air and moving along the welkin, looked<br>beautiful like flashes of lightning amid the clouds. And loud and fierce<br>was the uproar made by the twang of the bows stretched by the kings,<br>resembling the roar of the ocean while churned in the Krita age by the<br>gods and the great Asuras. And that army of thy sons, looking so proud,<br>consisting of (combatants of) diverse hues and shapes, shouting so<br>fiercely, and capable of slaying hostile warriors, then looked like those<br>masses of clouds that appear at the end of the Yuga.[409]'"
