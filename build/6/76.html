                            Dhritarashtra said, "Our army is possessed of many excellencies,<br>consisting of diverse forces, its efficiency is great. It is again<br>arrayed according to the rules of science and, therefore, ought to be<br>irresistible. It is attached to us exceedingly, and always devoted to us.<br>It is submissive, and free from the faults of drunkenness and<br>licentiousness. Its prowess had before been tested. The soldiers are<br>neither very old nor very young. They are neither lean nor corpulent. Of<br>active habits, of well-developed and strong frames, they are free from<br>disease. They are cased in mail and well-equipped with arms. They are<br>exercised in every kind of weapons. They are skilled in encounters with<br>swords, with bare arms, and with maces. They are well-exercised in<br>lances, sabres, and darts, as also in iron clubs, short arrows, javelins<br>and mallets. They are devoted to all kinds of armed exercises, and are<br>adepts in mounting upon and descending from the backs of elephants, in<br>moving forward and stepping back, in smiting effectually, in marching and<br>retreating. Many a time have they been tested in the management of<br>elephants and steeds and cars. Having been examined duly they have been<br>entertained on pay, and not for the sake of lineage, nor from favour nor<br>from relationship, nor from strength of attachments, nor from connections<br>of birth and blood. They are all respectable and honest, and their<br>kinsmen have been well-treated and gratified by us. We have done them<br>many good offices. They are, besides, all renowned men and endued with<br>great mental vigour. O son, they are again protected by many foremost of<br>men endued with great activity, and of famous achievements, resembling<br>the very Regents of the world and renowned over the whole earth.<br>Innumerable Kshatriyas, respected throughout the world, and who have of<br>their own will sided us with their forces and followers also protect<br>them. Indeed, our army is like the vast ocean filled with the water of<br>innumerable rivers running from all directions. It abounds with<br>elephants, and with cars which though destitute of wings, yet resemble<br>the winged tenants of the air. Vast numbers of combatants constitute the<br>waters of that ocean, and the steeds and other animals constitute its<br>terrible waves. Innumerable swords and maces and darts and arrows and<br>lances constitute the oars (piled on that ocean). Abounding with<br>standards and ornaments and adorned with cloth inlaid with gold and gems,<br>the rushing steeds and elephants constitute the winds agitating it into<br>fury. Our host, therefore, really resembles the vast, shoreless ocean<br>roaring in rage. And that host is protected by Drona and Bhishma and by<br>Kritavarman and Kripa and Dussasana, and others headed by Jayadratha. It<br>is also protected by Bhagadatta and Vikarna by Drona's son, and Suvala's<br>son, and Valhika and by many other mighty and high-souled heroes of the<br>world. That our army should yet be slaughtered in battle is due only to<br>predestined fate, O Sanjaya. Neither men nor highly blessed Rishis of old<br>ever beheld such preparations (for battle) on earth before. That so large<br>an army, mustered according to science, and attached (to us) by wealth,<br>should yet be slaughtered in battle, alas, what can it be but the result<br>of Destiny? O Sanjaya, all these seem to be unnatural. Indeed Vidura had<br>often said what was both beneficial and desirable. But my wicked son<br>Duryodhana would not accept it. I believe that high-souled and<br>well-knowing person had foreseen all that is now happening and hence the<br>counsel he gave.[404] Or, O Sanjaya, all these, in all its details, had<br>been pre-arranged by Him, for that which is ordained by the Creator must<br>happen as ordained and cannot be otherwise."
