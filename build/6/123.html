                            "Sanjaya said,&#8212;'After the night had passed away, O monarch, all the<br>kings, the Pandavas and the Dhartarashtras, repaired to the grandsire,<br>Those Kshatriyas then saluted that bull of their order, that foremost one<br>among the Kurus, that hero lying on a hero's bed, and stood in his<br>presence. Maidens by thousands, having repaired to that place, gently<br>showered over Santanu's son powdered sandal wood and fried paddy, and<br>garlands of flowers. And women and old men and children, and ordinary<br>spectators, all approached Santanu's son like creatures of the world<br>desirous of beholding the Sun. And trumpets by hundreds and thousands,<br>and actors, and mimes, and skilled mechanics also came to the aged Kuru<br>grandsire. And ceasing to fight, putting aside their coats of mail, and<br>lying aside their weapons, the Kurus and the Pandavas, united together,<br>came to the invincible Devavrata, that chastiser of foes. And they were<br>assembled together as in days of old, and cheerfully addressed one<br>another according to their respective ages. And that conclave full of<br>Bharata kings by hundreds and adorned with Bhishma, looked beautiful and<br>blazing like a conclave of the gods in heaven. And that conclave of kings<br>engaged in honouring the son of Ganga looked as beautiful as a conclave<br>of the celestials engaged in adorning their Lord, viz., the Grandsire<br>(Brahman). Bhishma, however, O bull of Bharata's race, suppressing his<br>agonies with fortitude though burning with the arrows (still sticking to<br>his body), was sighing like a snake. His body burning with these arrows,<br>and himself nearly deprived of his senses in consequence of his<br>weapon-wounds, Bhishma cast his eyes on those kings and asked for water.<br>Then those Kshatriyas, O king, brought thither excellent viands and<br>several vessels of cold water. Beholding that water brought for him,<br>Santanu's son said,&#8212;I cannot, O sire, now use any article of human<br>enjoyment! I am removed from the pale of humanity. I am lying on a bed of<br>arrows. I am staying here, expecting only the return of the Moon and the<br>Sun! Having spoken these words and thereby rebuked those kings, O<br>Bharata, he said,&#8212;I wish to see Arjuna!&#8212;The mighty-armed Arjuna then<br>came there, and reverentially saluting the grandsire stood with joined<br>hands, and said,&#8212;What shall I do?&#8212;Beholding then that son of Pandu, O<br>monarch, thus standing before him after having offered him respectful<br>salutations, Bhishma of righteous soul cheerfully addressed Dhananjaya,<br>saying,&#8212;Covered all over with thy shafts, my body is burning greatly!<br>All the vital parts of my body are in agony. My mouth is dry. Staying as<br>I am with body afflicted with agony, give me water, O Arjuna! Thou art a<br>great bowman! Thou art capable of giving me water duly!&#8212;The valiant<br>Arjuna then saying,&#8212;So be it,&#8212;mounted on his car, and striking his<br>Gandiva with force, began to stretch it. Hearing the twang of his bow and<br>the slap of his palms which resembled the roar of the thunder, the troops<br>and the kings were all inspired with fear. Then that foremost of<br>car-warriors, mounted on his car, circumambulated that prostrate chief of<br>the Bharatas, that foremost of all wielders of weapons. Aiming then a<br>blazing arrow, after having inspired it with Mantras and identified it<br>with the Parjanya weapon, in the very sight of the entire army, the son<br>of Pandu, viz., Partha, pierced the Earth a little to the south of where<br>Bhishma lay. Then there arose a jet of water that was pure, and<br>auspicious, and cool, and that resembling the nectar itself, was of<br>celestial scent and taste. And with that cool jet of water Partha<br>gratified Bhishma, that bull among the Kurus, of godlike deeds and<br>prowess. And at that feat of Partha who resembled Sakra himself in his<br>acts, all those rulers of Earth were filled with great wonder. And<br>beholding that feat of Vibhatsu implying superhuman prowess, the Kurus<br>trembled like kine afflicted with cold. And from wonder all the kings<br>there present waved their garments (in the air). And loud was the blare<br>of conchs and the beat of drums that were then heard all over the field.<br>And Santanu's son, his thirst quenched, then addressed Jishnu, O monarch,<br>and said, applauding him highly in the presence of all those kings, these<br>words, viz.,&#8212;O thou of mighty arms, this is not wonderful in thee, O son<br>of Kuru's race! O thou of immeasurable effulgence, even Narada spoke of<br>thee as an ancient Rishi! Indeed, with Vasudeva as thy ally, thou wilt<br>achieve many mighty feats which the chief of the celestials himself with<br>all the gods, of a certainty, will not venture to achieve! They that have<br>knowledge of such things know thee to be the destroyer of the whole<br>Kshatriya race! Thou art the one bowman among the bowmen of the world!<br>Thou art the foremost among men. As human beings are, in this world,<br>foremost of all creatures, as Garuda is the foremost of all winged<br>creatures; as the Ocean is the foremost among all receptacles of water<br>and the cow among all quadrupeds; as the Sun is the foremost amongst all<br>luminous bodies and Himavat among all mountains; as the Brahmana is the<br>foremost among all castes, art thou the foremost of all bowmen!<br>Dhritarashtra's son (Duryodhana) listened not to the words repeatedly<br>spoken by me and Vidura and Drona and Rama and Janardana and also by<br>Sanjaya. Reft of his senses, like unto an idiot, Duryodhana placed no<br>reliance on those utterances. Past all instructions, he will certainly<br>have to lie down for ever, overwhelmed by the might of Bhima!&#8212;Hearing<br>these words of his, the Kuru king Duryodhana became of cheerless heart.<br>Eyeing him, Santanu's son said,&#8212;Listen, O king! Abandon thy wrath! Thou<br>hast seen, O Duryodhana how the intelligent Partha created that jet of<br>cool and nectar-scented water! There is none else in this world capable<br>of achieving such feat. The weapons appertaining to Agni, Varuna, Soma,<br>Vayu, and Vishnu, as also those appertaining to Indra, Pasupati, and<br>Paramesthi, and those of Prajapati, Dhatri, Tashtri, Savitri, and<br>Vivaswat, all these are known to Dhananjaya alone in this world of men!<br>Krishna, the son of Devaki, also knoweth them. But there is none else<br>here that knoweth them. This son of Pandu, O sire, is incapable of being<br>defeated in battle by even the gods and the Asuras together. The feats of<br>this high-souled one are superhuman. With that truthful hero, that<br>ornament of battle, that warrior accomplished in fight, let peace, O<br>king, be soon made! As long as the mighty-armed Krishna is not possessed<br>by wrath, O chief of the Kurus, it is fit, O sire, that peace should be<br>made with the heroic Parthas! As long as this remnant of thy brothers is<br>not slain, let peace, O monarch, be made! As long as Yudhishthira with<br>eyes burning in wrath doth not consume thy troops in battle, let peace, O<br>sire, be made! As long as Nakula, and Sahadeva, and Bhimasena, the sons<br>of Pandu, do not, O monarch, exterminate thy army, it seems to me that<br>friendly relations should be restored between thee and the heroic<br>Pandavas! Let this battle end with my death, O sire! Make peace with the<br>Pandavas, Let these words that are uttered to thee by me be acceptable to<br>thee, O sinless one! Even this is what I regard to be beneficial both for<br>thyself and the race (itself of Kuru)! Abandoning thy wrath, let peace be<br>made with Parthas. What Phalguni hath already done is sufficient. Let<br>friendly relations be restored with the death of Bhishma! Let this<br>remnant (of warriors) live! Relent, O king! Let half the kingdom be given<br>to the Pandavas. Let king Yudhishthira the just, go to Indraprastha. O<br>chief of the Kurus, do not achieve a sinful notoriety among the kings of<br>the earth by incurring the reproach of meanness, becoming a fomentor of<br>intestine dissensions! Let peace come to all with my death! Let these<br>rulers of earth, cheerfully mix with one another! Let sire get back the<br>son, let sister's son get back the maternal uncle! If from want of<br>understanding and possessed by folly thou dost not harken to those timely<br>words of mine thou wilt have to repent greatly! What I say is true.<br>Therefore, desist even now! Having, from affection, said these words unto<br>Duryodhana in the midst of the kings, the son of the ocean-going (Ganga)<br>became silent. Though his vital limbs were burning with the arrow-wounds,<br>yet, prevailing over his agonies, he applied himself to yoga.<br><br>"Sanjaya continued&#8212;'Having heard these beneficial and peaceful words<br>fraught with both virtue and profit, thy son, however, accepted them not,<br>like a dying man refusing medicine."
