                            Dhritarashtra said, "How did those bulls among men, viz., that great<br>bowman Drona, and Dhananjaya the son of Pandu, encounter each other in<br>battle? The son of Pandu is ever dear to the wise son of Bharadwaja. The<br>preceptor also is ever dear to Pritha's son, O Sanjaya. Both of those<br>car-warriors delight in battle, and both of them are fierce like lions.<br>How therefore, did Bharadwaja's son and Dhananjaya, both fighting with<br>care encounter each other in battle?"<br><br>Sanjaya said, "In battle Drona never recognises Partha as dear to<br>himself. Partha also, keeping a Kshatriya's duty in view, recognises not<br>in battle his preceptor. Kshatriyas, O king, never avoid one another in<br>battle. Without showing any regard for one another, they fight with sires<br>and brothers. In that battle, O Bharata, Partha pierced Drona with three<br>shafts. Drona, however, regarded not those shafts shot in battle from<br>Partha's bow. Indeed, Partha once more covered the preceptor in the fight<br>with a shower of arrows. Thereupon the latter blazed up with wrath like a<br>conflagration in a deep forest. Then, O king, Drona soon covered Arjuna<br>in that combat with many straight shafts, O Bharata. Then king<br>Duryodhana, O monarch, despatched Susarman for taking up the wing of<br>Drona. Then the ruler of the Trigartas, excited with rage and forcibly<br>drawing his bow, covered Partha, O king, with a profusion of arrows<br>furnished with iron heads. Shot by those two warriors, O king, the shafts<br>looked beautiful in the welkin like cranes in the autumnal sky. Those<br>shafts, O lord, reaching the son of Kunti, entered his body like birds<br>disappearing within a tree bending with a load of tasteful fruits. Arjuna<br>then, that foremost of car-warriors, uttering a loud roar in that battle<br>pierced the ruler of the Trigartas and his son with his shafts. Pierced<br>by Partha like Death himself at the end of the Yuga, they were unwilling<br>to avoid Partha, resolved as they were on laying down their lives. And<br>they shot showers on the car of Arjuna. Arjuna, however, received those<br>arrowy showers with showers of his own, like a mountain, O monarch,<br>receiving a downpour from the clouds. And the lightness of hand that we<br>then beheld of Vibhatsu was exceedingly wonderful. For alone he baffled<br>that unbearable shower of arrows shot by many warriors like the wind<br>alone scattering myriads of clouds rushing upon clouds. And at that feat<br>of Partha, the gods and the Danavas (assembled there for witnessing the<br>fight) were highly gratified. Then, O Bharata, engaged with the Trigartas<br>in that battle, Partha shot, O king, the Vayavya weapon against their<br>division. Then arose a wind that agitated the welkin, felled many trees,<br>and smote down the (hostile) troops. Then Drona, beholding the fierce<br>Vayavya weapon, himself shot an awful weapon called the Saila. And when<br>that weapon, O ruler of men, was shot by Drona in that battle, the wind<br>abated and the ten quarters became calm. The heroic son of Pandu,<br>however, made the car-warriors of the Trigarta division destitute of<br>prowess and hope, and caused them to turn their backs on the field. Then<br>Duryodhana and that foremost of car-warriors, viz., Kripa, and<br>Aswatthaman, and Salya, and Sudakshina, the ruler of the Kamvojas, and<br>Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti, and Valhika supported by the Valhikas, with<br>a large number of cars surrounded Partha on all sides. And similarly<br>Bhagadatta also, and the mighty Srutayush, surrounded Bhima on all sides<br>with an elephant division. And Bhurisravas, and Sala, and Suvala's son, O<br>monarch, began to check the twin sons of Madri with showers of bright and<br>sharp arrows. Bhishma, however, in that battle, supported by the sons of<br>Dhritarashtra with their troops, approaching Yudhishthira, surrounded him<br>on all sides. Beholding that elephant division coming towards him,<br>Pirtha's son Vrikodara, possessed of great courage, began to lick the<br>corners of his mouth like a lion in the forest. Then Bhima, that foremost<br>of car-warriors, taking up his mace in that great battle, quickly jumped<br>down from his car and struck terror into the hearts of thy warriors.<br>Beholding him mace in hand, those elephant-warriors in that battle<br>carefully surrounded Bhimasena on all sides. Stationed in the midst of<br>those elephants, the son of Pandu looked resplendent like the Sun in the<br>midst of a mighty mass of clouds. Then that bull among the sons of Pandu<br>began with his mace to consume that elephant-division like the wind<br>dispelling a huge mass of clouds covering the welkin. Those tuskers,<br>while being slaughtered by the mighty Bhimasena, uttered loud cries of<br>woe like roaring masses of clouds. With diverse scratches (on his person)<br>inflicted by those huge animals with their tusks, the son of Pritha<br>looked beautiful on the field of battle like a flowering Kinsuka. Seizing<br>some of the elephants by their tusks, he deprived them of those weapons.<br>Wrenching out the tusks of others, with those very tusks he struck them<br>on their frontal globes and felled them in battle like the Destroyer<br>himself armed with his rod. Wielding his mace bathed in gore, and himself<br>bespattered with fat and marrow and smeared with blood, he looked like<br>Rudra himself. Thus slaughtered by him, the few gigantic elephants that<br>remained, ran away on all sides, O king, crushing even friendly ranks.<br>And in consequence of those huge elephants fleeing away on all sides,<br>Duryodhana's troops once more, O bull of Bharata's race, fled away from<br>the field."
