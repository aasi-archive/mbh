                            Sanjaya said, "When the combatants of both armies, strong in number, were<br>thus disposed in battle array, all those unretreating heroes, O Bharata,<br>set their heart upon the region of Brahma.[485] In course of the general<br>engagement that followed, the same class of combatants did not fight with<br>the same class of combatants. Car-warriors fought not with car-warriors,<br>or foot-soldiers with foot-soldiers, or horsemen with horsemen, or<br>elephant-warriors with elephant-warriors. On the other hand, O monarch,<br>the combatants fought with one another like mad men. Great and dreadful<br>was the calamity that overtook both the armies. In that fierce slaughter<br>when elephants and men spread themselves on the field, all distinctions<br>between them ceased, for they fought indiscriminately.<br><br>"Then Salya and Kripa, and Chitrasena, O Bharata, and Dussasana, and<br>Vikarna, those heroes mounted on their bright cars, caused the Pandava<br>host to tremble. Slaughtered in battle by those high-souled warriors, the<br>Pandava army began to reel in diverse ways, O king, like a boat on the<br>waters tossed by the wind. As the wintry cold cuts kine to the quick, so<br>did Bhishma cut the sons of Pandu to the quick. As regards thy army also,<br>many elephants, looking like newly-risen clouds, were felled by the<br>illustrious Partha. And many foremost of warriors too were seen to be<br>crushed by that hero. And struck with arrows and long shafts in<br>thousands, many huge elephants fell down, uttering frightful shrieks of<br>pain. And the field of battle looked beautiful, strewn with the bodies,<br>still decked with ornaments of high-souled warriors deprived of life and<br>with heads still decked with ear-rings. And in that battle, O king, which<br>was destructive of great heroes, when Bhishma and Dhananjaya the son of<br>Pandu put forth their prowess, thy sons, O monarch, beholding the<br>grandsire exert himself vigorously, approached him, with all their troops<br>placed ahead. Desirous of laying down their lives in battle and making<br>heaven itself their goal, they approached the Pandavas in that battle,<br>which was fraught with great carnage. The brave Pandavas also, O king,<br>bearing in mind the many injuries of diverse kinds inflicted upon them<br>before by thee and thy son, O monarch, and casting off all fear, and<br>eager to win the highest heavens, cheerfully fought with thy son and the<br>other warriors of thy army.<br><br>"Then the generalissimo of the Pandava army, viz., the mighty car-warrior<br>Dhrishtadyumna, addressing his soldiers, said, 'Ye Somakas, accompanied<br>by the Srinjayas, rush ye at Ganga's son.' Hearing those words of their<br>commander the Somakas and the Srinjayas, though afflicted with showers of<br>arrows, rushed at the son of Ganga. Thus attacked, O king, thy sire<br>Bhishma, influenced by wrath, began to fight with the Srinjayas. In days<br>of old, O sire, the intelligent Rama had imparted to Bhishma of glorious<br>achievements that instruction in weapons which was so destructive of<br>hostile ranks. Relying on that instruction and causing a great havoc<br>among the troops of the foe, that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the old<br>Kuru grandsire Bhishma, day after day, slew ten thousand warriors of the<br>Ratha. On the tenth day, however, O bull of Bharata's race, Bhishma,<br>single-handed, slew ten thousand elephants. And then he slew seven great<br>car-warriors among the Matsyas and the Panchalas. In addition to all<br>this, in that dreadful battle five thousand foot-soldiers, and one<br>thousand tuskers, and ten thousand steeds, were also slain by thy sire, O<br>king, through skill acquired by education. Then having thinned the ranks<br>of all the kings, he slew Satanika, the dear brother of Virata. And the<br>valiant Bhishma, having slain Satanika in battle, felled, O king, full<br>one thousand Kshatriyas with his broad-headed shafts. Besides these, all<br>the Kshatriyas of the Pandava army who followed Dhananjaya, as soon as<br>they approached Bhishma, had to go to Yama's abode. Covering the Pandava<br>host from every side with showers of arrows, Bhishma stayed in battle at<br>the head of the Kaurava army. Achieving the most glorious feats on the<br>tenth day, as he stayed between the two armies, bow in hand, none of the<br>kings, O monarch, could even look at him, for he then resembled the hot<br>mid-day Sun in the summer sky. As Sakra scorched the Daitya host in<br>battle, even so, O Bharata, did Bhishma scorch the Pandava host.<br>Beholding him thus put forth his prowess, the slayer of Madhu, viz., the<br>son of Devaki, cheerfully addressing Dhananjaya, said, 'There, Bhishma,<br>the son of Santanu, stayeth between the two armies. Slaying him by<br>putting forth thy might, thou mayst win victory. There, at that spot,<br>whence he breaketh our ranks, check him, putting forth thy strength. O<br>lord, none else, save thee, ventureth to bear the arrows of Bhishma. Thus<br>urged, the ape-bannered Arjuna at that moment made Bhishma with his car,<br>steeds, and standard, invisible by means of his arrows. That bull,<br>however, among the foremost of Kurus, by means of his own arrowy showers,<br>pierced those showers of shafts shot by the son of Pandu. Then the king<br>of the Panchalas the valiant Dhrishtaketu, Bhimasena the son of Pandu,<br>Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race, the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva),<br>Chekitana, and the five Kaikaya brothers, and the mighty-armed Satyaki<br>and Subhadra's son, and Ghatotkacha, and the (five) sons of Draupadi, and<br>Sikhandin, and the valiant Kuntibhoja, and Susarman, and Virata, these<br>and many other powerful warriors of the Pandava army, afflicted by the<br>shafts of Bhishma, seemed to sink in an ocean of grief, Phalguni,<br>however, rescued them all. Then Sikhandin, taking up a mighty weapon and<br>protected by Kiritin, rushed impetuously towards Bhishma alone. The<br>unvanquished Vibhatsu then, knowing what should be done after what, slew<br>all those that followed Bhishma, and then himself rushed at him. And<br>Satyaki, and Chekitana, and Dhristadyumna of Prishata's race, and Virata,<br>and Drupada, and the twin sons of Madri by Pandu, all protected by that<br>firm bowman (viz., Arjuna) rushed against Bhishma alone in that battle.<br>And Abhimanyu, and the five sons of Draupadi also, with mighty weapons<br>upraised, rushed against Bhishma in battle. All those firm bowmen,<br>unretreating from battle, pierced Bhishma in diverse parts of his body<br>with well-aimed shafts. Disregarding all those shafts, large in number,<br>shot by those foremost of princes belonging to the Pandava host, Bhishma<br>of undepressed soul penetrated into the Pandava ranks. And the grandsire<br>baffled all those arrows, as if sporting the while. Frequently looking at<br>Sikhandin the prince of the Panchalas with a laugh, he aimed not a single<br>arrow at him, recollecting his femininity. On the other hand, he slew<br>seven great car-warriors belonging to Drupada's division. Then confused<br>cries of woe soon arose amongst the Matsyas, the Panchalas, and the<br>Chedis, who were together rushing at that single hero. With large numbers<br>of foot-soldiers and steeds and cars, and with showers of arrows, O<br>scorcher of foes, they overwhelmed that single warrior, viz., Bhishma the<br>son of Bhagirathi, that scorcher of foes, like the clouds overwhelming<br>the maker of day. Then in that battle between him and them, which<br>resembled the battle between the gods and the Asuras in days of old, the<br>diadem-decked (Arjuna), placing Sikhandin before him, pierced Bhishma<br>(repeatedly).'
