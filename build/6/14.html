                            "Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;'How hath Bhishma, that bull among the Kurus, been<br>slain by Sikhandin? How did my father, who resembled Vasava himself, fall<br>down from his car? What became of my sons, O Sanjaya, when they were<br>deprived of the mighty Bhishma who was like unto a celestial, and who led<br>life of Brahmacharyya for the sake of his father?[79] Upon the fall of<br>that tiger among men who was endued with great wisdom, great capacity for<br>exertion, great might and great energy, how did our warriors feel?<br>Hearing that bull amongst the Kurus, that foremost of men, that<br>unwavering hero is slain, great is the grief that pierceth my heart.<br>While advancing (against the foe), who followed him and who proceeded<br>ahead? Who stayed by his side? Who proceeded with him? What brave<br>combatants followed behind (protecting his rear) that tiger among<br>car-warriors, that wonderful archer, that bull among Kshatriyas, while he<br>penetrated into the divisions of the foe?[80] While seizing the hostile<br>ranks, what warriors opposed that slayer of foes resembling the luminary<br>of thousand rays, who spreading terror among the foe destroyed their<br>ranks like the Sun destroying darkness, and who achieved in battle<br>amongst the ranks of Pandu's sons feats exceedingly difficult of<br>accomplishment? How, indeed, O Sanjaya, did the Pandavas oppose in battle<br>the son of Santanu, that accomplished and invincible warrior when he<br>approached them smiting? Slaughtering the (hostile) ranks, having arrows<br>for his teeth, and full of energy, with the bow for his wide-open mouth,<br>and with the terrible sword for his tongue, and invincible, a very tiger<br>among men, endued with modesty, and never before vanquished, alas, how<br>did Kunti's son overthrow in battle that unconquered one, undeserving as<br>he was of such a fate,[81]&#8212;that fierce bowman shooting fierce shafts,<br>stationed on his excellent car, and plucking off the heads of foes (from<br>their bodies)&#8212;that warrior, irresistible as the Yuga-fire, beholding<br>whom addrest for battle the great army of the Pandavas always used to<br>waver? Mangling the hostile troops for ten nights, alas, that slayer of<br>ranks hath set like the Sun, having achieved feats difficult of<br>achievement. He who, scattering like Sakra himself and inexhaustible<br>shower of arrows, slew in battle a hundred millions of warriors in ten<br>days, that scion of Bharata's race, now lieth, although he deserveth it<br>not, on the bare ground, in the field of battle, deprived of life, a<br>mighty tree uprooted by the winds, as a result of my evil counsels!<br>Beholding Santanu's son Bhishma of terrible prowess, how indeed, could<br>the army of the Pandavas[82] succeed in smiting him there? How did the<br>sons of Pandu battle with Bhishma? How is it, O Sanjaya, that Bhishma<br>could not conquer when Drona liveth? When Kripa, again, was near him, and<br>Drona's son (Aswatthaman) also, how could Bhishma, that foremost of<br>smiters be slain? How could Bhishma who was reckoned as an Atiratha and<br>who could not be resisted by the very gods, be slain in battle by<br>Sikhandin, the prince of Panchala? He, who always regarded himself as the<br>equal of the mighty son of Jamadagni in battle, he whom Jamadagni's son<br>himself could not vanquish, he who resembled Indra himself in<br>prowess,&#8212;alas, O Sanjaya, tell me how that hero, Bhishma, born in the<br>race of Maharathas, was slain in battle, for without knowing all the<br>particulars I cannot regain my equanimity. What great bowmen of my army,<br>O Sanjaya, did not desert that hero of unfading glory? What heroic<br>warriors, again, at Duryodhana's command, stood around that hero (for<br>protecting him)? When all the Pandavas placing Sikhandin in their van<br>advanced against Bhishma, did not all the Kurus,[83] O Sanjaya, stay by<br>the side of that hero of unfading prowess? Hard as my heart is, surely it<br>must be made of adamant, for it breaketh not on hearing the death of that<br>tiger among men, viz., Bhishma! In that irresistible bull of Bharata's<br>race, were truth, and intelligence, and policy, to an immeasurable<br>extent. Alas, how was he slain in battle? Like unto a mighty cloud of<br>high altitude, having the twang of his bowstring for its roar, his arrows<br>for its rain-drops, and the sound of his bow for its thunder, that hero<br>showering his shafts on Kunti's sons with the Panchalas and the Srinjayas<br>on their side, smote hostile car-warriors like the slayer of Vala smiting<br>the Danavas. Who were the heroes that resisted, like the bank resisting<br>the surging sea, that chastiser of foes, who was a terrible ocean of<br>arrows and weapons, an ocean in which shafts were the irresistible<br>crocodiles and bows were the waves, an ocean that was inexhaustible,<br>without an island, agitated and without a raft to cross it, in which<br>maces and swords were like sharks and steeds and elephants like eddies,<br>and foot-soldiers like fishes in abundance, and the sound of conches and<br>drums like its roar, and ocean that swallowed horses and elephants and<br>foot-soldiers quickly, an ocean that devoured hostile heroes and that<br>seethed with wrath and energy which constituted its Yadava-fire?[84] When<br>for Duryodhana's good, that slayer of foes, Bhishma, achieved (terrible)<br>feats in battle, who were then in his van? Who were they that protected<br>the right wheel of that warrior of immeasurable energy? Who were they<br>that, mustering patience and energy, resisted hostile heroes from his<br>rear? Who stationed themselves in his near front for protecting him? Who<br>were those heroes that protected the fore-wheel of that brave warrior<br>while he battled (with the foe)? Who were they that stationing themselves<br>by his left wheel smote the Srinjayas? Who were they that protected the<br>irresistible advance ranks of his van? Who protected the wings of that<br>warrior who hath made the last painful journey? And who, O Sanjaya,<br>fought with hostile heroes in the general engagement? If he was protected<br>by (our) heroes, and if they were protected by. him, why could he not<br>then speedily vanquish in battle the army of the Pandavas, invincible<br>though it be? Indeed, O Sanjaya, how could the Pandavas succeed even in<br>striking Bhishma who was like Parameshti himself, that Lord and creator<br>of all creatures?[85] Thou tellest me, O Sanjaya, if the disappearance of<br>that Bhishma, that tiger among men, who was our refuge and relying upon<br>whom the Kurus were fighting with their foes, that warrior of mighty<br>strength relying on whose energy my son had never reckoned the Pandavas,<br>alas, how hath he been slain by the enemy?[86] In days of yore, all the<br>gods while engaged in slaying the Danavas, sought the aid of that<br>invincible warrior, viz., my father of high vows. That foremost of sons<br>endued with great energy, on whose birth the world-renowned Santanu<br>abandoned all grief, melancholy, and sorrows, how canst thou tell me, O<br>Sanjaya, that that celebrated hero, that great refuge of all, that wise<br>and holy personage who was devoted to the duties of his order and<br>conversant with the truths of the Vedas and their branches, hath been<br>slain? Accomplished in every weapon and endued with humility, gentle and<br>with passions under full control, and possessed of great energy as he<br>was, alas, hearing that son of Santanu slain I regard the rest of my army<br>as already slain. In my judgment, unrighteousness hath now become<br>stronger than righteousness, for the sons of Pandu desire sovereignty<br>even by killing their venerable superior! In days of yore, Jamadagni's<br>son Rama, who was acquainted with every weapon and whom none excelled,<br>when addrest for battle on behalf of Amvya, was vanquished by Bhishma in<br>combat. Thou tellest me that that Bhishma, who was the foremost of all<br>warriors and who resembled Indra himself in the feats he achieved, hath<br>been slain. What can be a greater grief to me than this? Endued with<br>great intelligence, he that was not slain even by that slayer of hostile<br>heroes, that Rama, the son of Jamadagni, who defeated in battle crowds of<br>Kshatriyas repeatedly, he hath now been slain by Sikhandin. Without<br>doubt, Drupada's son Sikhandin, therefore who hath slain in battle that<br>bull of Bharata's race, that hero acquainted with the highest weapons,<br>that brave and accomplished warrior conversant with every weapon, is<br>superior in energy, prowess, and might to the invincible Vargava endued<br>with the highest energy. In that encounter of arms who were the heroes<br>that followed that slayer of foes? Tell me how the battle was fought<br>between Bhishma and the Pandavas. The army of my son, O Sanjaya, reft of<br>its hero, is like an unprotected woman. Indeed, that army of mine is like<br>a panic-struck herd of kine reft of its herdsman. He in whom resided<br>prowess superior to that of every one, when he was laid low on the field<br>of battle, what was the state of mind of my army? What power is there, O<br>Sanjaya, in our life, when we have caused our father of mighty energy,<br>that foremost of righteous men in the world, to be slain? Like a person<br>desirous of crossing the sea when he beholds the boat sunk in fathomless<br>waters, alas, my sons, I ween, are bitterly weeping from grief on<br>Bhishma's death. My heart, O Sanjaya, is surely made of adamant, for it<br>rendeth not even after hearing the death of Bhishma, that tiger among<br>men. That bull among men in whom were weapons, intelligence, and policy,<br>to an immeasurable extent, how, alas, hath that invincible warrior been<br>slain in battle? Neither in consequence of weapons nor of courage, nor of<br>ascetic merit, nor of intelligence, nor of firmness, nor of gift, can a<br>man free himself from death. Indeed, time, endued with great energy, is<br>incapable of being transgressed by anything in the world, when thou<br>tellest me, O Sanjaya, that Santanu's son Bhishma is dead. Burning with<br>grief on account of my sons, in fact, overwhelmed with great sorrow, I<br>had hoped for relief from Bhishma, the son of Santanu. When he beheld<br>Santanu's son, O Sanjaya, lying on earth like the Sun (dropped from the<br>firmament), what else was made by Duryodhana as his refuge? O Sanjaya,<br>reflecting with the aid of my understanding, I do not see what the end<br>will be of the kings belonging to my side and that of the enemy and now<br>mustered in the opposing ranks of battle. Alas, cruel are the duties of<br>the Kshatriya order as laid down by the Rishis, since the Pandavas are<br>desirous of sovereignty by even compassing the death of Santanu's son,<br>and we also are desirous of sovereignty by offering up that hero of high<br>vows as a sacrifice.[87] The sons of Pritha, as also my sons, are all in<br>the observance of Kshatriya duties. They, therefore, incur no sin (by<br>doing) this. Even a righteous person should do this, O Sanjaya, when<br>direful calamities come. The display of prowess and the exhibition of the<br>utmost might have been laid down among the duties of the Kshatriyas.<br><br>"'How, indeed, did the sons of Pandu oppose my father Bhishma, the son of<br>Santanu, that unvanquished hero endued with modesty, while he was engaged<br>in destroying the hostile ranks? How were the troops arrayed, and how did<br>he battle with high-souled foes? How, O Sanjaya, was my father Bhishma<br>slain by the enemy? Duryodhana and Karna and the deceitful Sakuni, the<br>son of Suvala, and Dussasana also,&#8212;what did they say when Bhishma was<br>slain? Thither where the dice-board is constituted by the bodies of men,<br>elephants, and steeds, and, where arrows and javelins and large swords<br>and bearded darts from the dice, entering that frightful mansion of<br>destructive battle's play, who were those wretched gamblers,&#8212;those bulls<br>among men,&#8212;that gambled, making their very lives the frightful stakes?<br>Who won, who were vanquished, who cast the dice successfully, and who<br>have been slain, besides Bhishma, the son of Santanu? Tell me all, O<br>Sanjaya, for peace cannot be mine, hearing that Devavrata hath been<br>slain,&#8212;that father of mine, of terrible deeds, that ornament of battle,<br>viz., Bhishma! Keen anguish had penetrated my heart, born of the thought<br>that all my children would die. Thou makest that grief of mine blaze<br>forth, O Sanjaya, like fire by pouring clarified butter on it. My sons,<br><br>I ween, are even now grieving, beholding Bhishma slain,&#8212;Bhishma<br>celebrated in all worlds and who had taken upon himself a heavy burden. I<br>will listen to all those sorrows arising from Duryodhana's act.<br>Therefore, tell me, O Sanjaya, everything that happened<br>there,&#8212;everything that happened in the battle, born of the folly of my<br>wicked son. Ill-ordered or well-ordered, tell me everything, O Sanjaya.<br>Whatever was achieved with the aid of energy in the battle by Bhishma<br>desirous of victory,&#8212;by that warrior accomplished in arms,&#8212;tell me all<br>fully and in detail. How, in fact, the battle took place between the<br>armies of the Kurus and the manner in which each happened.'"
