                            Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;"When that great bowman Sweta proceeded towards<br>Salya's car, what did the Kauravas and the Pandavas do, O Sanjaya? And<br>what also did Bhishma the son of Santanu do? Tell me who ask thee, all<br>this."<br><br>Sanjaya said,&#8212;"O king, hundreds and thousands of bulls among Kshatriyas,<br>all brave and mighty car-warriors, placing the generalissimo Sweta in the<br>van, and displaying their strength. O Bharata, unto thy royal son and<br>with Sikhandin also at their head, desired to rescue (Sweta). And those<br>mighty car-warriors rushed towards Bhishma's car decked with gold<br>desirous of slaying that foremost of warriors. And the battle that ensued<br>then was terrible. I shall describe to thee that wonderful and terrific<br>battle as it occurred between thy troops and those of the enemy. The son<br>of Santanu made the terraces of many cars empty, (for) that best of<br>car-warriors showering (his) arrows, cut off many heads. Endued with<br>energy equal to that of the Sun himself, he shrouded the very Sun with<br>his arrows. And he removed his enemies from around him in that combat<br>like the rising Sun dispelling the darkness around. And in that battle, O<br>king, arrows were shot by him in hundreds and thousands that were<br>powerful and possessed of great impetuosity and that took in that<br>conflict the lives of numberless Kshatriyas. And in that combat he felled<br>heads, by hundreds, of heroic warriors, O king, and elephants cased in<br>thorny mail, like summits of mountains (felled) by heaven's bolt. And<br>cars, O king, were seen to mingle with cars. A car might be seen upon<br>another car, and a steed upon another steed. And impetuous chargers, O<br>king, bore hither and thither heroic riders in the prime of youth, slain<br>and hanging (from their saddles) with their bows (still in their<br>grasp).[339] With swords and quivers attached (to their persons) and<br>coats of mail loosened (from their bodies), hundreds of warriors,<br>deprived of life, lay on the ground, sleeping on beds (worthy) of heroes.<br>Rushing against one another, falling down and rising up again and rushing<br>again having risen up, the combatants fought hand to hand. Afflicted by<br>one another, many rolled on the field of battle. Infuriate elephants<br>rushed hither and thither, and car-warriors by hundreds were slain. And<br>car-warriors, along with their cars, were crushed on all sides. And some<br>warriors fell upon his car, slain by another with arrows. And a mighty<br>car-warrior might be seen to fall down from high, his charioteer (also)<br>having been slain. A thick dust arose, and thereupon unto the warrior<br>struggling in battle, the twang of the (hostile) bow indicated the<br>struggling adversary before. From the pressure also on their bodies,<br>combatants guessed their foes. And the warriors, O king, fought on with<br>arrows, guided by the sound of bow-strings and (hostile) division. The<br>very hiss of the arrows shot by the combatants at one another could not<br>be heard. And so loud was the sound of drums, that it seemed to pierce<br>the ears. And in that tumultuous uproar making the hair stand on end, the<br>name of the combatant uttered in the battle, while displaying his<br>prowess, could not be heard. The sire could not recognise the son of his<br>loins. One of the wheels being broken, or the yoke being torn off or one<br>of the steeds being slain, the brave car-warrior was overthrown from his<br>car, along with his charioteer, by means of straight arrows. And thus<br>many heroic warriors, deprived of their cars, were seen to fly away.[340]<br>He who was slain had cut off; he who was not slain, was struck at the<br>very vitals: but unstruck there was none, when Bhishma attacked the foe.<br>And in that terrific battle, Sweta caused a great slaughter of the Kurus.<br>And he slew many noble princes by hundreds upon hundreds.[341] And he cut<br>off, by means of his arrows, the heads of car-warriors by hundreds upon<br>hundreds, and (their) arms decked with Angadas, and (their) bows all<br>around. And car-warriors and car-wheels and others that were on cars, and<br>the cars themselves, and standards both small and costly, O king, and<br>large bodies of horses, and crowds of cars, and crowds of men, O<br>Bharata's race, were destroyed by Sweta. Ourselves, from fear of Sweta,<br>abandoning (Bhishma) that best of car-warriors, left the battle<br>retreating to the rear and, therefore, do we (now) behold your lordship.<br>And all the Kurus, O son of Kuru's race, beyond the range of arrows, and<br>abandoning Bhishma the son of Santanu, in that battle, stood (as<br>spectators though) armed for the combat. Cheerful in the hour of<br>(universal) cheerlessness, that tiger among men Bhishma, alone of our<br>army, in that terrible battle stood immovable like the mountain Meru.<br>Taking the lives (of the foe) like the Sun at close of winter, he stood<br>resplendent with the golden rays (of his car) like the Sun himself with<br>his rays. And that great bowman shot clouds of arrows and struck down the<br>Asuras.[342] And while being slaughtered by Bhishma in that dreadful<br>combat, those warriors breaking away from their ranks, they all fled from<br>him, as if from a fire fed by fuel.[343] Encountering the single warrior<br>(Sweta), that slayer of foes, Bhishma, was the only one (amongst us) who<br>was cheerful and whole. Devoted to the welfare of Duryodhana, he began to<br>consume the Pandava (warrior). Reckless of his very life which is<br>difficult of being cast off, and abandoning all fear he slaughtered, O<br>king, the Pandava army in that fierce conflict.[344] And beholding the<br>generalissimo (Sweta) smiting the (Dhartarashtra) divisions, thy father<br>Bhishma, called also Devavrata, impetuously rushed against him.<br>Thereupon, Sweta covered Bhishma with an extensive net-work of arrows.<br>And Bhishma also covered Sweta with a flight of arrows. And roaring like<br>a couple of bulls, they rushed, like two infuriate elephants of gigantic<br>size or two raging tigers, against each other. Baffling each other's<br>weapons by means of their weapons, those bulls among men, viz., Bhishma<br>and Sweta fought with each other, desirous of taking each other's life.<br>In one single day Bhishma, infuriate with anger, could consume the<br>Pandava army with his arrows, if Sweta did not protect it. Beholding the<br>grandsire then turned off by Sweta, the Pandavas were filled with joy,<br>while thy son became cheerless. Duryodhana then, with wrath excited and<br>surrounded by many kings, rushed with his troops against the Pandava host<br>in battle. Then Sweta, abandoning the son of Ganga, slaughtered thy son's<br>host with great impetuosity like the wind (uprooting) trees with<br>violence. And the son of Virata, senseless with wrath, having routed thy<br>army, advanced (once more), O king, to the place where Bhishma was<br>stationed. And those two high-souled and mighty warriors then, both<br>blazing with their arrows, battled with each other like Vritra and Vasava<br>(of old), desirous, O king, of slaying each other. Drawing (his) bow to<br>the fullest stretch, Sweta pierced Bhishma with seven arrows. The<br>valourous (Bhishma) then, putting forth his prowess, quickly checked his<br>foe's valour, like an infuriate elephant checking an infuriate compeer.<br>And Sweta then, that delighter of Kshatriyas struck Bhishma, and Bhishma<br>the son of Santanu also pierced him in return with ten arrows. And though<br>pierced by him (thus), that mighty warrior stood still like a mountain.<br>And Sweta again pierced Santanu's son with five and twenty straight<br>arrows, at which all wondered. Then smiling and licking with his tongue<br>the corners of his mouth, Sweta in that combat cut off Bhishma's bow into<br>ten fragments with ten arrows. Then aiming a plumed arrow made wholly of<br>iron, (Sweta) crushed the palmyra on the top of the standard of the<br>high-souled (Bhishma). And beholding the standard of Bhishma cut down,<br>thy sons thought that Bhishma was slain, having succumbed to Sweta. And<br>the Pandavas also filled with delight, blew their conches all around. And<br>beholding the palmyra standard of the high-souled Bhishma laid low,<br>Duryodhana, from wrath, urged his own army to the battle. And they all<br>began very carefully to protect Bhishma who 'was in great distress. Unto<br>them, also unto those that stood (idle) spectators, the king<br>said,&#8212;Either Sweta will die (today), or Bhishma the son of Santanu. I<br>say this truly. Hearing the words of the king, the mighty car-warriors<br>speedily with four kinds of forces, advanced protecting the son of Ganga.<br>And Valhika and Kritavarman, and Kripa, and Salya also, O Bharata, and<br>the son of Jarasandha, and Vikarna, and Chitrasena, and Vivinsati, with<br>great speed, when speed was so necessary, surrounding him on all sides,<br>poured on Sweta ceaseless showers of arrows. That mighty warrior then, of<br>immeasurable soul, quickly checked those angry warriors by means of sharp<br>arrows, displaying his own lightness of hand. And checking them all like<br>a lion and a multitude of elephants, Sweta then cut off Bhishma's bow<br>with thick shower of arrows. Then Bhishma the son of Santanu, taking up<br>another bow in that battle, pierced Sweta, O king, with arrows furnished<br>with feathers of Kanka bird. Then the commander (of the Pandava army),<br>with wrath excited, pierced Bhishma in that encounter O king, with a<br>great many shafts in the very sight of all. Beholding Bhishma, that<br>foremost of heroes in all the world, checked in battle by Sweta, the king<br>(Duryodhana) became greatly troubled, and great also became the distress<br>of thy whole army. And beholding the heroic Bhishma checked and mangled<br>by Sweta with his arrows, all thought that Bhishma, having succumbed to<br>Sweta, was slain by him. Then thy sire Devavrata, yielding to anger, and<br>beholding his (own) standard overthrown and the (Dhartarashtra) army<br>checked, shot a great many arrows, O king, at Sweta. Sweta, however, that<br>foremost of car-warriors, baffling all those arrows of Bhishma, once more<br>cut off, with a broad-headed shaft, thy sire's bow. Throwing aside that<br>bow, O king, Ganga's son, senseless with anger, taking up another bow<br>larger and stronger, and aiming seven large broad-headed arrows whetted<br>on stone, slew with four arrows the four steeds of the generalissimo<br>Sweta, cut off his standard with two and with the seventh shaft that<br>warrior of great prowess, exceedingly provoked, cut off his charioteer's<br>head. Thereupon, that mighty car-warrior, jumping down from his car whose<br>steeds and charioteer had been slain[345], and yielding to the influence<br>of wrath, became exceedingly troubled. The grandsire, beholding Sweta<br>that foremost of car-warriors, deprived of car, began to smite him on all<br>sides with showers of arrows. And smitten in that combat with arrows shot<br>from Bhishma's bow, Sweta, leaving his bow on his (abandoned) car took up<br>a dart decked with gold and taking up that terrible and fierce dart[346]<br>which resembled the fatal rod of Death and was capable of slaying Death's<br>self. Sweta then, in great wrath, addressed Bhishma the son of Santanu in<br>that combat, saying,&#8212;Wait a little, and behold me, O best of men,&#8212;And<br>having said this unto Bhishma in battle, that great bowman of exceeding<br>prowess and immeasurable soul, hurled the dart resembling a snake,<br>displaying his valour for the sake of the Pandavas and desiring to<br>achieve thy evil. Then loud cries of oh and alas arose among thy sons, O<br>king, upon beholding that terrible dart resembling the rod of Death in<br>splendour. And hurled from Sweta's arms, (that dart), resembling a snake<br>that had just cast off its slough, fell with great force, O king, like a<br>large meteor from the firmament. Thy sire Devavrata then, O king, without<br>the slightest fear, with eight sharp and winged arrows, cut off into nine<br>fragments, that dart decked with pure gold and which seemed to be covered<br>with flames of fire, as it coursed ablaze through the air. All thy troops<br>then, O bull of Bharata's race, set up loud shouts of joy. The son of<br>Virata, however, beholding his dart cut off into fragments, became<br>senseless with anger, and like one whose heart was overcome by (the<br>arrival of) his hour, could not settle what to do. Deprived of his senses<br>by anger, O king, the son of Virata, then, smiling, joyfully took up a<br>mace for Bhishma's slaughter, with eyes red in wrath, and resembling a<br>second Yama armed with mace, he rushed against Bhishma like a swollen<br>torrent against the rocks. Regarding his impetuosity as incapable of<br>cheek, Bhishma endued with great prowess and conversant with the might<br>(of others), suddenly alighted on the ground for warding off that blow.<br>Sweta then, O king, whirling in wrath that heavy mace, hurled it on<br>Bhishma's car like the god Maheswara.[347] And in consequence of that<br>mace intended for Bhishma's destruction, that car was reduced to ashes,<br>with standard, and charioteer, and steeds and shaft. Beholding Bhishma,<br>that foremost of car-warriors, become a combatant on foot, many<br>car-warriors, viz., Salya and others, speedily rushed (to his rescue).<br>Mounting then upon another car, and cheerlessly stretching his bow,<br>Bhishma slowly advanced towards Sweta, seeing that foremost of<br>car-warriors. Meanwhile, Bhishma heard a loud voice uttered in the skies,<br>that was celestial and fraught with his own good. (And the voice<br>said).&#8212;'O, Bhishma, O thou of mighty arms, strive without losing a<br>moment. Even this is the hour fixed by the Creator of the Universe for<br>success over this one'. Hearing those words uttered by the celestial<br>messenger, Bhishma, filled with joy, set his heart upon Sweta's<br>destruction. And beholding that foremost of car-warriors, Sweta become a<br>combatant on foot, many mighty car-warriors (of the Pandava side) rushed<br>unitedly (to his rescue). (They were) Satyaki, and Bhimasena, and<br>Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race; and the (five) Kekaya brothers, and<br>Dhrishtaketu and Abhimanyu of great energy. And beholding them rushing<br>(to the rescue), with Drona and Salya and Kripa that hero of immeasurable<br>soul (Bhishma) checked them all like the mountain resisting the force of<br>the wind. And when all the high-souled warriors of the Pandava side were<br>(thus) held in check, Sweta, taking up a sword cut off Bhishma's bow.<br>Casting aside that bow, the grandsire, quickly made up his mind for<br>Sweta's destruction, having heard the words of the celestial messenger.<br>Though baffled (by Sweta), thy sire Devavrata then that mighty<br>car-warrior quickly taking up another bow that resembled the bow of Sakra<br>himself in splendour, stringed it in a moment. Then thy sire, O chief of<br>the Bharatas, beholding that mighty car-warrior Sweta, though the latter<br>was then surrounded by those tigers among men with Bhimasena at their<br>head,&#8212;(thy sire) the son of Ganga-advanced steadily for the sake of the<br>generalissimo Sweta alone. Beholding Bhishma advance, Bhimasena of great<br>prowess pierced him with sixty shafts. But that mighty car-warrior, thy<br>sire Devavrata, checking both Bhimasena and Abhimanyu and other<br>car-warriors with terrible shafts, struck him with three straight arrows.<br>And the grandsire of the Bharatas also struck Satyaki, in that combat,<br>with a hundred arrows, and Dhrishtadyumna with twenty and the Kekaya<br>brothers with five. And checking all those great bowmen with terrible<br>arrows, thy sire Devavrata advanced towards Sweta alone. Then taking out<br>an arrow resembling Death's self and capable of bearing a great strain<br>and incapable of being resisted, the powerful Bhishma placed it on his<br>bowstring. And that shaft, furnished with wings and duly endued with the<br>force of the Brahma weapon, was seen by the gods and Gandharvas and<br>Pisachas and Uragas, and Rakshasas. And that shaft, of splendour like<br>that of a blazing fire, piercing through his coat of mail (passed through<br>his body and) struck into the earth, with a flash like that of heaven's<br>bolt. Like the Sun when speedily retiring to his western chambers taking<br>along with him the rays of light, even thus that shaft passed out of<br>Sweta's body, bearing away with itself his life. Thus slain in battle by<br>Bhishma, we beheld that tiger among men fall down like the loosened crest<br>of a mountain. And all the mighty car-warriors of the Kshatriya race<br>belonging to the Pandava side indulged in lamentations. Thy sons,<br>however, and all the Kurus, were filled with delight. Then, O king,<br>beholding Sweta overthrown, Dussasana danced in joy over the field in<br>accompaniment With the loud music of conches and drums. And when that<br>great bowman was slain by Bhishma, that ornament of battle, the mighty<br>bowmen (of the Pandava side) with Sikhandin at their head, trembled in<br>fear. Then when their commander was slain, Dhananjaya, O king, and he of<br>Vrishni's race, slowly withdrew the troops (for their nightly rest). And<br>then, O Bharata, the withdrawal took place of both theirs and thine,<br>while thine and theirs were frequently setting up loud roars. And the<br>mighty car-warriors of the Parthas entered (their quarters) cheerlessly,<br>thinking, O chastiser of foes, of that awful slaughter in single combat<br>(of their commander)."
