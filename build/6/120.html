                            Sanjaya said, "Thus all the Pandavas, placing Sikhandin before them<br>pierced Bhishma in that battle repeatedly surrounding him on all sides.<br>And all the Srinjayas, uniting together, struck him with dreadful<br>Sataghnis, and spiked maces, and battle-axes, and mallets, and short<br>thick clubs, and bearded darts, and other missiles, and arrows furnished<br>with golden wing, and darts and lances and kampanas; and with long<br>shafts, and arrows furnished with heads shaped like the calf-tooth, and<br>rockets. Thus afflicted by many, his coat of mail was pierced everywhere.<br>But though pierced in every vital part, Bhishma felt no pain. On the<br>other hand, he then seemed to his enemies to resemble in appearance the<br>(all-destructive) fire that rises at the end of Yuga. His bow and arrows<br>constituted the blazing flames (of that fire). The flight of his weapons<br>constituted its (friendly) breeze. The rattle of his car-wheels<br>constituted its heat and mighty weapons constituted its splendour. His<br>beautiful bow formed its fierce tongue, and the bodies of heroic<br>warriors, its profuse fuel. And Bhishma was seen to roll through the<br>midst of crowds of cars belonging to those kings, or to come out (of the<br>press) at times, or course once more through their midst. Then,<br>disregarding the king of the Panchalas and Dhrishtaketu, he penetrated, O<br>monarch, into the midst of the Pandava army. He then pierced the six<br>Pandava warriors, viz., Satyaki, and Bhima, and Dhananjaya the son of<br>Pandu, and Drupada, and Virata, and Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race,<br>with many excellent arrows of great sharpness and dreadful whizz and<br>exceeding impetuosity, and capable of piercing through every kind of<br>armour. Those mighty car-warriors, however, checking those keen shafts,<br>afflicted Bhishma with great force, each of them striking him with ten<br>shafts. Those mighty shafts, whetted on stone and furnished with golden<br>wings, which the great car-warrior Sikhandin shot, quickly penetrated<br>into Bhishma's body. Then the diadem-decked (Arjuna), excited with wrath,<br>and placing Sikhandin ahead rushed at Bhishma and cut off the latter's<br>bow. Thereupon mighty car-warriors, seven in number, viz., Drona and<br>Kritavarman, and Jayadratha the ruler of the Sindhus, and Bhurisravas,<br>and Sala, and Salya, and Bhagadatta could not brook that act of Arjuna.<br>Inflamed with rage, they rushed at him. Indeed, those mighty<br>car-warriors, invoking into existence celestial weapons, fell with great<br>wrath upon that son of Pandu, and covered him with their arrows. And as<br>they rushed towards Phalguni's car, the noise made by them was heard to<br>resemble that made by the ocean itself when it swelleth in rage at the<br>end of the Yuga, Kill, Bring up (our forces), Take, Pierce, Cut off, this<br>was the furious uproar heard about Phalguni's car. Hearing that furious<br>uproar, the mighty car-warriors of the Pandava army rushed forward, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, for protecting Arjuna. They were Satyaki, and<br>Bhimasena, and Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race, and both Virata and<br>Drupada, and the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, and the wrathful Abhimanyu. These<br>seven, inflamed with rage, and armed with excellent bows, rushed with<br>great speed. And the battle that took place between these and the Kaurava<br>warriors was fierce, making the hair stand on end, and resembling O chief<br>of the Bharatas, the battle of the gods with the Danavas. Sikhandin,<br>however, that foremost of car-warriors, protected in the battle by the<br>diadem-decked (Arjuna), pierced Bhishma, in that encounter, with ten<br>shafts after the latter's bow had been cut off. And he struck Bhishma's<br>charioteer with other shafts, and cut off the latter's standard with one<br>shaft. Then the son of Ganga took up another bow that was tougher. That<br>even was cut off by Phalguni with three sharp shafts. Indeed, that<br>chastiser of foes, viz., Arjuna, who was capable of drawing the bow with<br>even his left hand, excited with rage, one after another, cut off all the<br>bows that Bhishma took up. Then Bhishma, whose bows were thus cut off,<br>excited with rage, and licking the corners of his mouth, took up a dart<br>that was capable of riving a hill. In rage he hurled it at Phalguni's<br>car. Beholding its course towards him like the blazing bolt of heaven,<br>the delighter of the Pandavas fixed five sharp broad-headed arrows (on<br>his bow-string). And with those five arrows, O chief of the Bharatas, the<br>angry Arjuna cut off into five fragments that dart hurled from Bhishma's<br>arms. Thus cut off by the angry Arjuna, that dart then fell down like a<br>flash of lightning separated from a mass of clouds. Beholding his dart<br>cut off, Bhishma became filled with rage. That hero, that subjugator of<br>hostile cities, then began to reflect. And he said unto himself, 'With<br>only a single bow I could slay all the Pandavas, if the mighty Vishnu<br>himself had not been their protector. For two reasons, however, I will<br>not fight with the Pandavas, viz., their unslayableness, and the<br>femininity of Sikhandin. Formerly, when my sire wedded Kali, he pleased<br>(with me) gave me two boons, viz., that I should be incapable of being<br>slain in battle, and that my death should depend on my own choice. I<br>should, however, now wish my own death, this being the proper hour.'<br>Ascertaining this to be the resolve of Bhishma of immeasurable energy,<br>the Rishis and the Vasus stationed in the firmament, said, 'That which<br>hath been resolved by thee is approved by us also, O son! Act according<br>to thy resolution, O king. Withdraw thy heart from battle.' On the<br>conclusion, of those words, fragrant and auspicious breeze charged with<br>particles of water, began to blow along a natural direction.[486] And<br>celestial cymbals of loud sounds began to beat. And a flowery shower fell<br>upon Bhishma, O sire. The words spoken by the Rishis and the Vasus,<br>however, O king, were not heard by any one save Bhishma himself. I also<br>heard them, through the power conferred on me by the Muni. Great was the<br>grief, O monarch, that filled the hearts of the celestials at the thought<br>of Bhishma, that favourite of all the worlds, falling down from his car.<br>Having listened to these words of the celestials, Santanu's son Bhishma<br>of great ascetic merit rushed out at Vibhatsu, even though he was then<br>being pierced with sharp arrows capable of penetrating through every<br>armour. Then Sikhandin, O king, excited with rage, struck the grandsire<br>of the Bharatas in the chest with nine sharp arrows. The Kuru grandsire<br>Bhishma, however, though struck by him in battle, thus, trembled not, O<br>monarch, but remained unmoved like a mountain during an earthquake. Then<br>Vibhatsu, drawing his bow Gandiva with a laugh, pierced the son of Ganga<br>with five and twenty arrows. And once more, Dhananjaya, with great speed<br>and excited with wrath struck him in every vital part with hundreds of<br>arrows. Thus pierced by others, also with thousands of arrows, the mighty<br>car-warrior Bhishma pierced those others in return with great speed. And<br>as regards the arrows shot by those warriors, Bhishma, possessed of<br>prowess in battle that was incapable of being baffled, equally checked<br>them all with his own straight arrows. Those arrows, however, endued with<br>wings of gold and whetted on stone, which the mighty car-warrior<br>Sikhandin shot in that battle, scarcely caused Bhishma any pain. Then the<br>diadem-decked (Arjuna), excited with rage and placing Sikhandin to the<br>fore, approached Bhishma (nearer) and once more cut off his bow. And then<br>piercing Bhishma with ten arrows, he cut off the latter's standard with<br>one. And striking Bhishma's chariot with ten arrows, Arjuna caused him to<br>tremble. The son of Ganga then took up another bow that was stronger.<br>Within, however, the twinkling of an eye, as soon, in fact, as it was<br>taken up, Arjuna cut that bow also into three fragments with three<br>broad-headed shafts. And thus the son of Pandu cut off in that battle<br>even all the bows of Bhishma. After that, Bhishma the son of Santanu, no<br>longer desired to battle with Arjuna. The latter, however, then pierced<br>him with five and twenty arrows. That great bowman, thus pierced greatly,<br>then addressed Dussasana, and skid, 'Behold, Partha, that great<br>car-warrior of the Pandavas, excited with wrath in battle, pierceth me<br>alone with many thousands of arrows. He is incapable of being vanquished<br>in battle by the wielder of the thunder-bolt himself. As regards myself<br>also, O hero, the very gods, Danavas and Rakshasas united together, are<br>incapable of vanquishing me. What I shall say then of mighty car-warriors<br>among men?' While Bhishma was thus speaking to Dussasana, Phalguni with<br>sharp shafts, and placing Sikhandin to the fore, pierced Bhishma in that<br>battle. Then Bhishma, deeply and excessively pierced by the wielder of<br>Gandiva with keen-pointed shafts, once more addressed Dussasana with a<br>smile and said, 'These arrows coursing towards me in one continuous line,<br>whose touch resembleth that of heaven's bolt, have been shot by Arjuna.<br>These are not Sikhandin's. Cutting me to the quick, piercing through even<br>my hard coat of mail, and striking me with the force of mushalas, these<br>arrows are not Sikhandin's. Of touch as hard as that of the Brahmana's<br>rod (of chastisement),[487] and of impetus unbearable as that of the<br>thunder-bolt, these arrows are afflicting my vital forces. These are not<br>Sikhandin's. Of the touch of maces and spiked bludgeons, those arrows are<br>destroying my vital forces like messengers of Death commissioned (by the<br>grim king himself). These are not Sikhandin's. Like angry snakes of<br>virulent poison, projecting their tongues out, these are penetrating into<br>my vitals. These are not Sikhandin's&#8212;these that cut me to the quick like<br>the cold of winter cutting kine to the quick. Save the heroic wielder of<br>Gandiva, viz., the ape-bannered Jishnu, even all other kings united<br>together cannot cause me pain. Saying these words, Bhishma, the valiant<br>son of Santanu, as if for the object of consuming the Pandavas, hurled a<br>dart at Partha. Partha, however, caused that dart to drop down, cutting<br>it into three fragments with three shafts, in the very sight, O Bharata,<br>of all the Kuru heroes of thy army. Desirous of obtaining either death or<br>victory, the son of Ganga then took up a sword and a shield decked with<br>gold. Before, however, he could come down from his car, Arjuna cut off by<br>means of his arrows, that shield into a hundred fragments. And that feat<br>of his seemed exceedingly wonderful. Then the king Yudhishthira urged his<br>own troops, saying, 'Rush ye at Ganga's son. Do not entertain the<br>slightest fear'. Then, armed with bearded darts, and lances, and arrows,<br>from all sides, with axes, and excellent scimitars, and long shafts of<br>great sharpness, with calf-toothed arrows, and broad-headed shafts, they<br>all rushed at that single warrior. Then arose from among the Pandava host<br>a loud shout. Then thy sons also, O king, desirous of Bhishma's victory,<br>surrounded him and uttered leonine shouts. Fierce was the battle fought<br>there between thy troops and those of the enemy on that the tenth day, O<br>king, when Bhishma and Arjuna met together. Like unto the vortex that<br>occurs at the spot where the Ganga meets the Ocean, for a short while a<br>vortex occurred there where the troops of both armies met and struck one<br>another down. And the Earth, wet with gore, assumed a fierce form. And<br>the even and the uneven spots on her surface could no longer be<br>distinguished. Although Bhishma was pierced in all his vital limbs, yet<br>on that the tenth day he stayed (calmly) in battle, having slain ten<br>thousand warriors. Then that great bowman, Partha, stationed at the head<br>of his troops, broke the centre of the Kuru army. Ourselves then, afraid<br>of Kunti's son Dhananjaya having white steeds attached to his car, and<br>afflicted by him with polished weapons, fled away from the battle. The<br>Sauviras, the Kitavas, the Easterners, the Westerners, the Northerners,<br>the Malavas, the Abhishahas, the Surasenas, the Sivis, the Vasatis, the<br>Salwas, the Sayas, the Trigartas, the Amvashthas, and the<br>Kaikeyas.[488]&#8212;these and many other illustrious warriors,&#8212;afflicted<br>with arrows and pained by their wounds, abandoned Bhishma in that battle<br>while he was fighting with the diadem-decked (Arjuna). Then a great many<br>warriors, surrounding that single warrior on all sides, defeated the<br>Kurus (that protected him) and covered him with shower of arrows. Throw<br>down, Seize, Fight, Cut into pieces,&#8212;this was the furious uproar, O<br>king, heard in the vicinity of Bhishma's car. Having slain in that<br>battle, O monarch, (his foes) by hundreds and thousands, there was not in<br>Bhishma's body space of even two fingers' breadth that was not pierced<br>with arrows. Thus was thy sire mangled with arrows of keen points by<br>Phalguni in that battle. And then he fell down from his car with his head<br>to the east, a little before sunset, in the very sight of thy sons. And<br>while Bhishma fell, loud cries of alas and oh, O Bharata, were heard in<br>the welkin uttered by the celestials and the kings of the earth. And<br>beholding the high-souled grandsire falling down (from his car), the<br>hearts of all of us fell with him. That foremost of all bowmen, that<br>mighty-armed hero, fell down, like an uprooted standard of Indra, making<br>the earth tremble the while.[489] Pierced all over with arrows, his body<br>touched not the ground. At that moment, O bull of Bharata's race, a<br>divine nature took possession of that great bowman lying on a bed of<br>arrows. The clouds poured a (cool) shower (over him) and the Earth<br>trembled. While falling he had marked that the Sun was then in the<br>southern solstice. That hero, therefore, permitted not his senses to<br>depart, thinking of that (inauspicious) season (of death). And all around<br>in the welkin he heard celestial voices saying, 'Why, Oh why, should<br>Ganga's son, that foremost of all warriors of weapons, yield up his life<br>during the southern declension?' Hearing these words, the son of Ganga<br>answered, 'I am alive!' Although fallen upon the earth, the Kuru<br>grandsire Bhishma, expectant of the northern declension, suffered not his<br>life to depart. Ascertaining that to be his resolve, Ganga, the daughter<br>of Himavat, sent unto him the great Rishis in swanlike form. Then those<br>Rishis in the forms of swans inhabiting the Manasa lake, quickly rose up,<br>and came together, for obtaining a sight of the Kuru grandsire Bhishma,<br>to that spot where that foremost of men was lying on his bed of arrows.<br>Then those Rishis in swanlike forms, coming to Bhishma, beheld that<br>perpetuator of Kuru's race lying on his bed of arrows. Beholding that<br>high-souled son of Ganga, that chief of the Bharatas, they walked round<br>him, and the Sun being then in the southern solstice, they said,<br>addressing one another, these words, 'Being a high-souled person, why<br>should Bhishma pass out (of the world) during the southern declension?'<br>Having said these words, those swans went away, proceeding towards the<br>southern direction. Endued with great intelligence, Bhishma, O Bharata.<br>beholding them, reflected for a moment. And the son of Santanu then said<br>unto them. 'I will never pass out (of the world) as long as the Sun is in<br>the southern solstice. Even this is my resolve. I will proceed to my own<br>ancient abode when the Sun reacheth the northern solstice. Ye swans, I<br>tell you this truly. Expectant of the northern declension I will hold my<br>life. Since I have the fullest control over the yielding up of my life, I<br>will, therefore, hold life, expectant of death during the northern<br>declension. The boon that was granted to me by my illustrious sire, to<br>the effect that my death would depend on my own wish O, let that boon<br>become true. I will hold my life, since I have control in the matter of<br>laying it down.' Having said these words to those swans, he continued to<br>lie down on his bed of arrows.<br><br>"When that crest of the Kuru race, viz., Bhishma of great energy, fell<br>down, the Pandavas and the Srinjayas uttered leonine shouts. When the<br>grandsire of the Bharatas who was endued with great might was overthrown,<br>thy son, O bull of Bharata's race, knew not what to do. And all the Kurus<br>were entirely deprived of their senses. And the Kurus headed by Kripa,<br>and Duryodhana, sighed and wept. And from grief they remained for a long<br>while deprived of their senses. And they remained perfectly still, O<br>monarch, without setting their hearts on battle. As if seized by thighs,<br>they stood motionless, without proceeding against the Pandavas. When<br>Santanu's son Bhishma of mighty energy, who was (regarded as) unslayable,<br>was slain, all of us thought that the destruction of the Kuru king was at<br>hand.[490] Vanquished by Savyasachin, with our foremost heroes slain, and<br>ourselves mangled with sharp arrows, we knew not what to do. And the<br>heroic Pandavas possessed of massive arms that looked like spiked maces,<br>having obtained the victory and won a highly blessed state in the other<br>world,[491] all blew their great conches. And the Somakas and the<br>Panchalas all rejoiced, O king. Then when thousands of trumpets were<br>blown, the mighty Bhimasena slapped his arm-pits and uttered loud shouts.<br>When the all-powerful son of Ganga was slain, the heroic warriors of both<br>armies, laying down their weapons, began to reflect thoughtfully. And<br>some uttered loud shrieks and some fled away, and some were deprived of<br>their senses. And some censured the practices of the Kshatriya order and<br>some applauded Bhishma. And the Rishis and the Pitris all applauded<br>Bhishma of high vows. And the deceased ancestors of the Bharatas also<br>praised Bhishma. Meanwhile the valiant and intelligent Bhishma, the son<br>of Santanu, having recourse to that Yoga which is taught in the great<br>Upanishads and engaged in mental prayers, remained quiet, expectant of<br>his hour."
