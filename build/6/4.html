                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Having said these words unto Dhritarashtra, Vyasa<br>took his departure. And Dhritarashtra also, having heard those words,<br>began to reflect in silence. And having reflected for only a short space<br>of time, he began to sigh repeatedly. And, soon, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, the king asked Sanjaya of soul worthy of praise,&#8212;saying,&#8212;'O<br>Sanjaya, these kings, these lords of earth, so brave and taking delight<br>in battle, are for smiting one another with weapons of diverse kinds,<br>being prepared to lay down their very lives for the sake of earth.<br>Incapable of being restrained, they are, indeed, smiting one another for<br>increasing the population of Yama's domain. Desirous of prosperity<br>connected with the possession of earth they are incapable of bearing one<br>another. I, therefore, think that earth must be possessed of many<br>attributes. Tell me all these, O Sanjaya, Many thousands, many millions,<br>many tens of millions, many hundreds of millions, heroic men have come<br>together at Kurujangala. I desire to hear, O Sanjaya, with accurate<br>details, about the situation and dimensions of those countries and cities<br>from which they have come. Through the potency of that regenerate Rishi<br>Vyasa of immeasurable energy, thou art endued with the lamp of celestial<br>perception and the eye of knowledge.<br><br>"Sanjaya said,&#8212;'O thou of great wisdom, I will recount to thee the<br>merits of earth according to my knowledge. Behold them with thy eye of<br>wisdom. I bow to thee, O bull of Bharata's race. Creatures in this world<br>are of two kinds, mobile and immobile. Mobile creatures are of three<br>kinds according to their birth, viz., oviparous, viviparous, and those<br>engendered by heat and damp. Of mobile creatures, O king, the foremost<br>are certainly those called viviparous. Of viviparous creatures the<br>foremost are men and animals. Animals, O king, of diverse forms, are of<br>fourteen species. Seven have their abodes in the woods, and seven of<br>these are domestic. Lions, tigers, boars, buffaloes, and elephants as<br>also bears and apes, are, O king, regarded as wild. Kine, goats, sheep,<br>men, horses, mules, and asses,&#8212;these seven amongst animals are reckoned<br>as domestic by the learned. These fourteen, O king, complete the tale of<br>domestic and wild animals, mentioned, O lord of earth, in the Vedas, and<br>on which the sacrifices rest. Of creatures that are domestic, men are<br>foremost, while lions are the foremost of those that have their abode in<br>the woods. All creatures support their life by living upon one another.<br>Vegetables are said to be immobile, and they are of four species viz.,<br>trees, shrubs, creepers, creeping plants existing for only a year, and<br>all stemless plants of the grass species.[30] Of mobile and immobile<br>creatures, there are thus one less twenty; and as regards their universal<br>constituents, there are five. Twenty-four in all, these are described as<br>Gayatri (Brahma) as is well-known to all.[31] He who knows these truly to<br>be the sacred Gayatri possessed of every virtue, is not liable, O best of<br>the Bharatas, to destruction in this world. Everything springeth from the<br>earth and everything, when destroyed, mergeth into the Earth. The Earth<br>is the stay and refuge of all creatures, and the Earth is eternal. He<br>that hath the Earth, hath the entire universe with its mobile and<br>immobile population. It is for this that longing for (the possession of<br>the) Earth, kings slay one another.'"
