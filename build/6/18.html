                            Sanjaya said,&#8212;"Soon after, O king, a loud uproar, causing the heart to<br>tremble was heard, made by the combatants ready for the fight. Indeed,<br>with the sounds of conches and drums, the grunts of elephants, and the<br>clatter of car-wheels, the Earth seemed to rend in twain. And soon the<br>welkin and the whole Earth was filled with the neigh of chargers and the<br>shouts of combatants. O irresistible one, the troops of thy sons and of<br>the Pandavas both trembled when they encountered each other. There (on<br>the field of battle) elephants and cars, decked in gold, looked beautiful<br>like clouds decked with lightning. And standards of diverse forms, O<br>king, belonging to the combatants on thy side, and adorned with golden<br>rings, looked resplendent like fire. And those standards of thy side and<br>theirs, resembled, O Bharata, the banners of Indra in his celestial<br>mansions. And the heroic warriors all accoutred and cased in golden coats<br>of mail endued with the effulgence of the blazing Sun, themselves looked<br>like blazing fire or the Sun. All the foremost warriors amongst the<br>Kurus, O king, with excellent bows, and weapons upraised (for striking),<br>with leathern fences on their hands, and with standards,&#8212;those mighty<br>bowmen, of eyes large as those of bulls, all placed themselves at the<br>heads of their (respective) divisions. And these amongst thy sons, O<br>king, protected Bhishma from behind, viz.. Dussasana, and Durvishaha, and<br>Durmukha, and Dussaha and Vivinsati, and Chitrasena, and that mighty<br>car-warrior Vikarna. And amongst them were Satyavrata, and Purumitra, and<br>Jaya, and Bhurisravas, and Sala. And twenty thousand car-warriors<br>followed them. The Abhishahas, the Surasenas, the Sivis, and the Vasatis,<br>the Swalyas, the Matsyas, the Amvashtas, the Trigartas, and the Kekayas,<br>the Sauviras, the Kitavas, and the dwellers of the Eastern, Western, and<br>the Northern countries,&#8212;these twelve brave races were resolved to fight<br>reckless of the lives. And these protected the grandsire with a<br>multitudinous array of cars. And with a division that consisted of ten<br>thousand active elephants, the king of Magadha followed that large car<br>division. They that protected the wheels of the cars and they that<br>protected the elephants, numbered full six millions. And the<br>foot-soldiers that marched in advance (of the army), armed with bows,<br>swords, and shields, numbered many hundreds of thousands. And they fought<br>also using their nails and bearded darts. And the ten and one Akshauhinis<br>of thy son, O Bharata, looked, O mighty king, like Ganga separated from<br>Yamuna.[102]"
