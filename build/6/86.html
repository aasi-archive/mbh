                            Sanjaya said, "Then the mighty Dhananjaya, struck with those shafts and<br>drawing long breaths like a trodden snake, cut off, with great force, by<br>means of his successive shafts, the bows of those mighty car-warriors.<br>Cutting off in a moment, O king, the bows of those powerful monarchs in<br>that battle, the high-souled Arjuna, desiring to exterminate them pierced<br>all of them simultaneously with his shafts. Struck (thus) by Indra's son,<br>O king, some of them fell down on the field, covered with blood. And some<br>had their limbs mangled, and some had their heads struck off. And some<br>perished with bodies mangled and coats of mail cut through. And afflicted<br>by the arrows of Partha, many of them, falling down on the earth,<br>perished together. Beholding then those princes slain in battle, the<br>ruler of the Trigartas advanced on his car. And two and thirty others<br>amongst those car-warriors, they who had been protecting the rear of the<br>slain combatants also fell upon Partha. These all, surrounding Partha,<br>and drawing their bows of loud twang, poured on him a thick shower of<br>arrows like the clouds pouring torrents of water on the mountain breast.<br>Then Dhananjaya afflicted with that arrowy down-pour in that battle,<br>became excited with wrath, and with sixty arrows steeped in oil he<br>despatched all those protectors of the rear. Having vanquished in battle<br>those sixty car-warriors, the illustrious Dhananjaya became cheerful at<br>heart. And having slain also the forces of those kings, Jishnu sped for<br>Bhishma's slaughter. Then the ruler of the Trigartas, beholding his<br>friends those mighty car-warriors slain, speedily advanced upon Partha,<br>with a number of (other) kings in his van, for slaying him. Then the<br>Pandava warrior headed by Sikhandin, beholding those combatants advancing<br>upon Dhananjaya that foremost of all conversant with arms, proceeded with<br>whetted weapons in hand, desirous of protecting the car of Arjuna. Partha<br>also beholding those brave men advanced towards him with the ruler of the<br>Trigartas, mangled them in battle with arrows shot from Gandiva. Then<br>that distinguished bowman, desirous of approaching Bhishma beheld<br>Duryodhana and other kings headed by the ruler of the Sindhus. Fighting<br>with great energy for a moment and checking those warriors that were<br>desirous of protecting Bhishma, the heroic Arjuna of great valour and<br>infinite prowess avoiding Duryodhana and Jayadratha and others,&#8212;that<br>warrior of mighty strength and great mental vigour,&#8212;at last proceeded,<br>bow and arrow in hand, towards the son of Ganga in battle. The<br>high-souled Yudhishthira also, of fierce prowess and infinite renown,<br>avoiding in battle the ruler of the Madras who had been assigned to his<br>share, quickly proceeded, with excited wrath and accompanied by Bhima and<br>the sons of Madri towards Bhishma, the son of Santanu, for battle.<br>Conversant with all modes of warfare the high-souled son of Ganga and<br>Santanu, though attacked in battle by all the sons of Pandu united<br>together, wavered not at all. Of fierce might and great energy king<br>Jayadratha of sure aim, advancing in battle, forcibly cut off with his<br>own excellent bow the bows of all those mighty car-warriors. And the<br>illustrious Duryodhana also with excited wrath and having wrath for his<br>position, struck Yudhishthira and Bhimasena and the twins and Partha,<br>with arrows resembling flames of fire. Pierced with arrows by Kripa and<br>Sala and Chitrasena, O lord, the Pandavas, inflamed with rage, resembled<br>the gods pierced with arrows by the united Daityas (in days of old). King<br>Yudhishthira then, beholding Sikhandin flying away, having had his weapon<br>cut off by Santanu's son became filled with anger. The high-souled<br>Ajatasatru, angrily addressing Sikhandin in that battle, said these<br>words, 'Thou saidst at that time, in the presence of thy sire, unto<br>me&#8212;Even I shall slay Bhishma of high vows with my shafts of the hue of<br>the effulgent sun. Truly do I say this.&#8212;Even this was thy oath. That<br>oath of thine thou dost not fulfil inasmuch as thou dost not slay<br>Devavrata in battle. O hero, be not a person of unfulfilled vow. Take<br>care of thy virtue, race, and fame. Behold Bhishma of terrible<br>impetuosity scorching all my troops with his innumerable arrows of fierce<br>energy and destroying everything in a moment like Death himself. With thy<br>bow cut off avoiding the battle, and vanquished by the royal son of<br>Santanu, whither dost thou go, forsaking thy kinsmen and brothers? This<br>doth not become thee. Beholding Bhishma of infinite prowess, and our army<br>routed and flying away, thou art assuredly, O son of Drupada, frightened,<br>since the colour of thy face is pale. Unknown to thee, O hero, Dhananjaya<br>hath engaged in the dreadful battle. Celebrated over the whole world, why<br>O hero, art thou afraid today of Bhishma.[423]'&#8212;Hearing these words of<br>king, Yudhishthira the just, that were harsh, though fraught with sound<br>reason, the high-souled Sikhandin, regarding them as good counsel,<br>speedily set himself about slaying Bhishma.[424] And while Sikhandin was<br>proceeding to battle with great impetuosity for falling upon Bhishma,<br>Salya began to resist him with terrible weapons that were difficult of<br>being baffled. The son of Drupada, however, O king, of prowess equal to<br>that of Indra himself, beholding those weapons effulgent as the fire that<br>blazeth forth at the hour of universal dissolution (thus) displayed, was<br>not confounded in the least. Checking those weapons by means of his own<br>shafts, that mighty bowman, viz., Sikhandin, stayed there without moving.<br>And then he took up another weapon, viz., the fierce Varuna weapon for<br>baffling (those fiery weapons of Salya). Then the celestials staying in<br>the firmament, and the kings of the earth also, all beheld Salya's<br>weapons baffled by that Varuna weapon of Sikhandin. Meanwhile, the<br>high-souled and heroic Bhishma, O king, in that battle, cut off the bow<br>and the variegated standard also of Pandu's son, king Yudhishthira of the<br>Ajamida race. Thereupon casting aside his bow and arrows upon beholding<br>Yudhishthira overwhelmed with fear, and taking up a mace in that battle,<br>Bhimasena rushed, on foot, at Jayadratha. Then Jayadratha, with five<br>hundred terrible arrows of keen points and each resembling the rod of<br>Death, pierced Bhimasena from every side who was thus rushing impetuously<br>at him, mace in hand. Disregarding those arrows, the impetuous Vrikodara,<br>with heart filled with rage, slew in that battle all the steeds, born in<br>Aratta, of the king of the Sindhus. Then beholding Bhimasena on foot, thy<br>son (Chitrasena) of unrivalled prowess and resembling the chief of the<br>celestials himself, quickly rushed at him on his car, with upraised<br>weapons, for giving him his quietus. Bhima also, roaring and uttering a<br>loud shout, rushed at him impetuously, mace in hand. Thereupon the<br>Kauravas all around beholding that upraised mace resembling the rod of<br>Death, forsaking thy brave son, fled away, desirous of avoiding its fall<br>(amongst them). In that fierce and awful crush (of men), O Bharata,<br>confounding the senses, Chitrasena, however, beholding that mace coursing<br>towards him, was not deprived of his senses. Taking up a bright scimitar<br>and a shield, he forsook his car and became a warrior on foot in the<br>field, for jumping down (from his vehicle) like a lion from the top of a<br>cliff he came down upon the level ground. Meanwhile that mace, failing<br>upon that beautiful car and destroying the vehicle itself with its steeds<br>and charioteer in that battle, dropped on the ground like a blazing<br>meteor, loosened from the firmament, failing upon the earth. Then thy<br>troops, O Bharata, beholding that highly wonderful feat became filled<br>with joy, and all of them together set up a loud shout over the field of<br>battle. And the warriors all applauded thy son (for what they witnessed)."
