                            [(Bhagavad Gita, Chapter XVII)]<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'What is the state, O Krishna, of those who abandoning the<br>ordinance of the scriptures, perform sacrifices endued with faith? It is<br>one of Goodness, or Passion, or Darkness?'<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'The faith of embodied (creatures) is of three kinds.<br>It is (also) born of their (individual) natures. It is good, passionate,<br>and dark. Hear now these. The faith of one, O Bharata, is conformable to<br>his own nature. A being here is full of faith; and whatever is one's<br>faith, one is even that. They that are of the quality of goodness worship<br>the gods; they that are of the quality of passion (worship) the Yakshas<br>and the Rakshasas; other people that are of the quality of darkness<br>worship departed spirits and hosts of Bhutas. Those people who practise<br>severe ascetic austerities not ordained by the scriptures, are given up<br>to hypocrisy and pride, and endued with desire of attachment, and<br>violence,&#8212;those persons possessed of no discernment, torturing the<br>groups of organs in (their) bodies and Me also seated within (those)<br>bodies,&#8212;should be known to be of demoniac resolves. Food which is dear<br>to all is of three kinds. Sacrifice, penance, and gifts are likewise (of<br>three kinds). Listen to their distinctions as follows. Those kinds of<br>food that increase life's period, energy, strength, health, well-being,<br>and joy, which are savoury, oleaginous, nutritive, and agreeable, are<br>liked by God. Those kinds of food which are bitter, sour, salted,<br>over-hot, pungent, dry, and burning, and which produce pain, grief and<br>disease, are desired by the passionate. The food which is cold, without<br>savour, stinking and corrupt, and which is even refuse, and filthy, is<br>dear to men of darkness. That sacrifice is good which, being prescribed<br>by the ordinance, is performed by persons, without any longing for the<br>fruit (thereof) and the mind being determined (to it under the belief)<br>that its performance is a duty. But that which is performed in<br>expectation of fruit and even for the sake of ostentation, know that<br>sacrifice, O chief of the sons of Bharata, to be of the quality of<br>passion. That sacrifice which is against the ordinance, in which no food<br>is dealt out, which is devoid of mantras (sacred verse), in which no fees<br>are paid to the brahmanas assisting to it, and which is void of faith, is<br>said to be of the quality of darkness. Reverence to the gods, regenerate<br>ones, preceptors, and men of knowledge, purity, uprightness, the<br>practices of a Brahmacharin, and abstention from injury, are said to<br>constitute the penance of the body. The speech which causeth no<br>agitation, which is true, which is agreeable and beneficial, and the<br>diligent study of the Vedas, are said to be the penance of speech.<br>Serenity of the mind, gentleness, taciturnity, self-restraint, and purity<br>of the disposition,&#8212;these are said to be the penance of the mind. This<br>three-fold penance performed with perfect faith, by men without desire of<br>fruit, and with devotion, is said to be of the quality of goodness. That<br>penance which is performed for the sake of (gaining) respect, honour, and<br>reverence, with hypocrisy, (and) which is unstable and transient is said<br>to be of the quality of passion. That penance which is performed under a<br>deluded conviction, with torture of one's self, and for the destruction<br>of another, is said to be of the quality of darkness. That gift which is<br>given because it ought to be given, to one who cannot return any service<br>for it, in a proper time, and to a proper person, is said to be of the<br>quality of goodness. That, however, which is given reluctantly, for<br>return of services (past or expected), or even with an eye to<br>fruit,&#8212;that gift is said to be of the quality of passion. In an unfit<br>place and at an unfit time, the gift that is made to an unworthy object,<br>without respect, and with contempt, is said to be of the quality of<br>darkness. OM, TAT, SAT, this is said to be the three-fold designation of<br>Brahma. By that (Brahma), the Brahmanas and the Vedas, and the<br>Sacrifices, were ordained of old. Therefore, uttering the syllable OM,<br>the sacrifices, gifts, and penances, prescribed by the ordinance, of all<br>utterers of Brahma begin. Uttering TAT, the various rites of sacrifice,<br>penance, and gifts, without expectation of fruit, are performed by those<br>that are desirous of deliverance. SAT is employed to denote existence and<br>goodness. Likewise, O son of Pritha, the word SAT is used in any<br>auspicious act. Constancy in sacrifices, in penances and in gifts, is<br>also called SAT, and an act, too, for the sake of That is called<br>SAT.[291] Whatever oblation is offered (to the fire), whatever is given<br>away, whatever penance is performed, whatever is done, without faith, is,<br>O son of Pritha, said to be the opposite of SAT; and that is nought both<br>here and hereafter.[292]'
