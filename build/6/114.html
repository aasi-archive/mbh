                            Sanjaya said, "Hearing these words of the high-souled Drona, Bhagadatta<br>and Kripa and Salya and Kritavarman, and Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti,<br>and Jayadratha the ruler of the Sindhus, and Chitrasena and Vikarna and<br>Durmarshana and others, these ten warriors of thy army, supported by a<br>large host consisting of many nationalities, fought with Bhimasena,<br>desirous of winning high renown in the battle for Bhishma's sake. And<br>Salya struck Bhima with nine arrows, and Kritavarman struck him with<br>three, and Kripa with nine. And Chitrasena and Vikarna and Bhagadatta, O<br>sire, each struck him with ten arrows. And the ruler of the Sindhus<br>struck him with three, and Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti each struck him<br>with five arrows. And Duryodhana struck that son of Pandu with twenty<br>sharp arrows. Bhimasena, O king, pierced in return every one of those<br>kings, those foremost of men in the world, those mighty car-warriors of<br>the Dhartarashtra army, one after another. The brave Pandava, that slayer<br>of hostile heroes, pierced Salya with seven arrows, and Kritavarman with<br>eight. And he cut off Kripa's bow with arrow fixed thereon, O Bharata, in<br>the middle, dividing it in twain. And after thus cutting off his bow, he<br>pierced Kripa once more with seven arrows. And he struck Vinda and<br>Anuvinda with three arrows each. And he pierced Durmarshana with twenty<br>arrows, and Chitrasena with five, and Vikarna with ten, and Jayadratha<br>with five. And once more striking the ruler of the Sindhus with three<br>arrows, he uttered a loud shout, filled with joy. Then Gautama, that<br>foremost of car-warriors, taking up another bow, angrily pierced Bhima<br>with ten sharp shafts. Pierced with those ten shafts like a huge elephant<br>with the hook, the valiant Bhimasena, O king, filled with wrath, struck<br>Gautama in that battle with many shafts. Possessed of the splendour of<br>Yama himself, as he appears at the end of the Yuga, Bhimasena then, with<br>three arrows, despatched unto Death's domain the steeds of the ruler of<br>the Sindhus as also his charioteer. Thereupon that mighty car-warrior,<br>(viz., Jayadratha), quickly jumping down from that car whose steeds had<br>been slain, shot in that battle many sharp-pointed shafts at Bhimasena.<br>Then, O sire, with a couple of broad-headed arrows, he cut off, O chief<br>of the Bharatas, the bow of the high-souled king of the Sindhus in the<br>middle. His bow cut off, himself deprived of car, his steeds and<br>charioteer slain, Jayadratha then, O king, quickly mounted on the car of<br>Chitrasena. Indeed, the son of Pandu achieved in that battle a most<br>wonderful feat, for piercing all those mighty car-warriors and holding<br>them in check, he deprived, O sire, the ruler of the Sindhus of his car<br>in the very sight of all the army. Salya could not brook to see the<br>prowess that Bhimasena displayed, for saying unto him,&#8212;Wait, Wait,&#8212;he<br>aimed some sharp arrows well-polished by the forger's hands, and pierced<br>Bhima therewith in that battle. And Kripa and Kritavarman and the valiant<br>Bhagadatta, and Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti, and Chitrasena, and<br>Durmarshana, and Vikarna, and the valiant ruler of the Sindhus also, in<br>that battle,&#8212;These chastisers of foes, all quickly pierced Bhima for the<br>sake of Salya. Bhima then pierced each of them in return with five<br>arrows. And he pierced Salya then with seventy arrows and once more with<br>ten. And Salya then pierced him with nine arrows and once more with five.<br>And he pierced Bhimasena's charioteer also, deep in his vitals, with a<br>broad-headed arrow. The valiant Bhimasena then, beholding his charioteer<br>Visoka deeply pierced, sped three arrows at the arms and chest of the<br>ruler of Madras. And as regards the other great bowmen, he pierced each<br>of them in that battle With three straight arrows, and then uttered a<br>loud roar like that of a lion. Each of those great bowmen then, exerting<br>himself with vigour, deeply Pierced that son of Pandu skilled in battle,<br>with three arrows in his vitals. That mighty bowman viz., Bhimasena,<br>though pierced deeply, trembled not (but stood still) like a mountain<br>drenched with torrents of rain by showering clouds. Then that mighty<br>car-warrior of the Pandavas, filled with wrath, that celebrated hero,<br>deeply, pierced the ruler of the Madras with three arrows. And he pierced<br>the ruler of the Pragjyotishas, O king, in that battle, with a hundred<br>arrows. Of great renown, he then pierced Kripa with many arrows, and<br>then, displaying great dexterity, he cut off with a keen-edged shaft the<br>bow, with arrow fixed thereon, of the high-souled Kritavarman. Then<br>Kritavarman, that scorcher of foes, taking up another bow, struck<br>Vrikodara between his eyebrows with a long arrow. Bhima, however, in that<br>battle, having pierced Salya with nine arrows made wholly of iron, and<br>Bhagadatta with three, and Kritavarman with eight, pierced each of the<br>others with Gautama at their head, with two arrows. Those warriors also,<br>in return, pierced him, O king, with sharp-pointed shafts. Though thus<br>afflicted by those mighty car-warriors with all kinds of weapons, yet,<br>regarding them all as straw, he coursed on the field without any anxiety.<br>Those foremost of car-warriors (on the other hand), with great coolness,<br>sped at Bhima sharp-pointed arrows by hundreds and thousands. The heroic<br>and mighty Bhagadatta then, in that battle, hurled at him a dart of<br>fierce impetuosity furnished with a golden staff. And the Sindhu king, of<br>strong arms, hurled at him a lance and an axe. And Kripa, O king, hurled<br>at him a Sataghni, and Salya an arrow. And the other great bowmen each<br>sped at him five arrows with great force. The son of the Wind-god then<br>cut off, with a sharp shaft, that lance in twain. And he cut off that axe<br>also with three shafts, as if it were a sesame stalk. And with five<br>shafts winged with the feathers of the Kanka bird, he cut that Sataghni<br>into fragments. That mighty car-warrior then, having cut off the arrow<br>sped by the ruler of the Madras, forcibly cut off the dart sped by<br>Bhagadatta in that battle. As regards the other fierce shafts, Bhimasena,<br>proud of his feats in battle, cut them each into three fragments by means<br>of his own straight shafts. And he struck each of those great bowmen also<br>with three shafts. Then Dhananjaya, during the progress of that dreadful<br>battle, beholding the mighty car-warrior Bhima striking the foe and<br>battling (against many) with his arrows, came thither on his car. Then<br>those bulls among men, of thy army, beholding those two high-souled sons<br>of Pandu together, gave up all hopes of victory. Then Arjuna, desirous of<br>slaying Bhishma, placing Sikhandin before him, approached Bhima who had<br>been fighting with those great car-warriors and fell upon those fierce<br>combatants, numbering ten, of thy army, O Bharata. Then Vibhatsu,<br>desirous of doing what was agreeable to Bhima, pierced all those<br>warriors, O king, who had been battling with Bhima. Then king Duryodhana<br>urged Susarman, for the destruction of both Arjuna and Bhimasena, saying,<br>'O Susarman, go thou quickly supported by a large force. Slay those two<br>sons of Pandu, viz., Dhananjaya and Vrikodara.' Hearing these words of<br>his, the Trigarta king who ruled the country called Prasthala, quickly<br>rushed in battle upon those two bowmen, viz., Bhima and Dhananjaya, and<br>surrounded them both by many thousands of cars. Then commenced a fierce<br>battle between Arjuna and the foe."
