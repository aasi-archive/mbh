                            [(Bhagavad Gita Chapter IV)]<br><br>"The Holy One said,&#8212;'This imperishable (system of) devotion I declared<br>to Vivaswat: Vivaswat declared it to Manu; and Manu communicated it to<br>Ikshaku. Descending thus from generation, the Royal sages came to know<br>it. But, O chastiser of foes, by (lapse of a) long time that devotion<br>became lost to the world. Even the same (system of) devotion hath today<br>been declared by me to thee, for thou art my devotee and friend, (and)<br>this is a great mystery.'<br><br>"Arjuna said,&#8212;'Thy birth is posterior; Vivaswat's birth is prior. How<br>shall I understand then that thou hadst first declared (it)?'<br><br>"The Holy One said,&#8212;'Many births of mine have passed away, O Arjuna, as<br>also of thine. These all I know, but thou dost not, O chastiser of foes.<br>Though (I am) unborn and of essence that knoweth no deterioration, though<br>(I am) the lord of all creatures, still, relying on my own (material)<br>nature I take birth by my own (powers) of illusion. Whenever, O Bharata,<br>loss of piety and the rise of impiety occurreth, on those occasions do I<br>create myself. For the protection of the righteous and for the<br>destruction of the evil doers, for the sake of establishing Piety, I am<br>born age after age. He who truly knoweth my divine birth and work to be<br>such, casting off (his body) is not born again; (on the other hand) he<br>cometh to me, O Arjuna. Many who have been freed from attachment, fear,<br>wrath, who were full of me, and who relied on me, have, cleansed by<br>knowledge and asceticism, attained to my essence. In whatsoever manner<br>men come to me, in the selfsame manner do I accept them. It is my way, O<br>Partha, that men follow on all sides.[169] Those in this world who are<br>desirous of the success of action worship the gods, for in this world of<br>men success resulting from action is soon attained. The quadruple<br>division of castes was created by me according to the distinction of<br>qualities and duties. Though I am the author thereof, (yet) know me to be<br>not their author and undecaying.[170] Actions do not touch me. I have no<br>longing for the fruits of actions. He that knoweth me thus is not impeded<br>by actions. Knowing this, even men of old who were desirous of<br>emancipation performed work. Therefore, do thou also perform work as was<br>done by ancients of the remote past. What is action and what is<br>inaction,&#8212;even the learned are perplexed at this. Therefore, I will tell<br>thee about action (so that) knowing it thou mayst be freed from evil. One<br>should have knowledge of action, and one should have knowledge of<br>forbidden actions: one should also know of inaction. The course of action<br>is incomprehensible. He, who sees inaction in action and action in<br>inaction, is wise among men; he is possessed of devotion; and he is a<br>doer of all actions. The learned call him wise whose efforts are all free<br>from desire (of fruit) and (consequent) will, and whose actions have all<br>been consumed by the fire of knowledge.[171] Whoever, resigning all<br>attachment to the fruit of action, is ever contented and is dependent on<br>none, doth nought, indeed, although engaged in action. He who, without<br>desire, with mind and the senses under control, and casting off all<br>concerns, performeth action only for the preservation of the body,<br>incurreth no sin.[172] He who is contented with what is earned without<br>exertion, who hath risen superior to the pairs of opposites, who is<br>without jealousy, who is equable in success and failure, is not fettered<br>(by action) even though he works. All his actions perish who acts for the<br>sake of sacrifice,[173] who is without affections, who is free (from<br>attachments), and whose mind is fixed upon knowledge. Brahma is the<br>vessel (with which the libation is poured); Brahma is the libation (that<br>is offered); Brahma is the fire on which by Brahma is poured (the<br>libation); Brahma is the goal to which he proceedeth by fixing his mind<br>on Brahma itself which is the action.[174] Some devotees perform<br>sacrifice to the gods. Others, by means of sacrifice, offer up sacrifices<br>to the fire of Brahma.[175] Others offer up (as sacrificial libation) the<br>senses of which hearing is the first to the fire of restraint. Others<br>(again) offer up (as libations) the objects of sense of which sound is<br>the first to the fire of the senses.[176] Others (again) offer up all the<br>functions of the senses and the functions of the vital winds to the fire<br>of devotion by self-restraint kindled by knowledge.[177] Others again<br>perform the sacrifice of wealth, the sacrifice of ascetic austerities,<br>the sacrifice of meditation, the sacrifice of (Vedic) study, the<br>sacrifice of knowledge, and others are ascetics of rigid vows.[178] Some<br>offer up the upward vital wind (Prana) to the downward vital wind<br>(apana); and others, the downward vital wind to the upward vital wind;<br>some, arresting the course of (both) the upward and the downward vital<br>winds, are devoted to the restraint of the vital winds. Others of<br>restricted rations, offer the vital winds to the vital winds.[179] Even<br>all these who are conversant with sacrifice, whose sins have been<br>consumed by sacrifice, and who eat the remnants of sacrifice which are<br>amrita, attain to the eternal Brahma. (Even) this world is not for him<br>who doth not perform sacrifice. Whence then the other, O best of Kuru's<br>race? Thus diverse are the sacrifices occurring in the Vedas. Know that<br>all of them result from action, and knowing this thou wilt be<br>emancipated. The sacrifice of knowledge, O chastiser of foes, is superior<br>to every sacrifice involving (the attainment of) fruits of action, for<br>all action, O Partha, is wholly comprehended in knowledge.[180] Learn<br>that (Knowledge) by prostration, enquiry, and service. They who are<br>possessed of knowledge and can see the truth, will teach thee that<br>knowledge, knowing which, O son of Pandu, thou wilt not again come by<br>such delusion, and by which thou wilt see the endless creatures (of the<br>universe) in thyself (first) and then in me. Even if thou be the greatest<br>sinner among all that are sinful, thou shalt yet cross over all<br>transgressions by the raft of knowledge. As a blazing fire, O Arjuna,<br>reduceth fuel to ashes, so doth the fire of knowledge reduce all actions<br>to ashes. For there is nothing here that is so cleansing as knowledge.<br>One who hath attained to success by devotion finds it without effort<br>within his own self in time. He obtaineth knowledge, who hath faith and<br>is intent on it and who hath his senses under control; obtaining<br>knowledge one findeth the highest tranquillity in no length of time. One<br>who hath no knowledge and no faith, and whose minds is full of doubt, is<br>lost. Neither this world, nor the next, nor happiness, is for him whose<br>mind is full of doubt. Actions do not fetter him, O Dhananjaya, who hath<br>cast off action by devotion, whose doubts have been dispelled by<br>knowledge, and who is self-restrained. Therefore, destroying, by the<br>sword of knowledge, this doubt of thine that is born of ignorance and<br>that dwelleth in thy mind, betake to devotion, (and) arise, O son of<br>Bharata.'
