                            Sanjaya said,&#8212;Sikhandin, O bull among men, approaching Bhishma in<br>battle, struck him in the centre of the chest with ten broad-headed<br>arrows The son of Ganga, however, O Bharata, only looked at Sikhandin<br>with wrath and as if consuming the Panchala prince with that look.<br>Remembering his femininity, O king, Bhishma, in the very sight of all,<br>struck him not. Sikhandin, however, understood it not. Then Arjuna, O<br>monarch, addressed Sikhandin, saying,&#8212;'Rush quickly and slay the<br>grandsire. What needst thou say, O hero? Slay the mighty car-warrior<br>Bhishma. I do not see any other warrior in Yudhishthira's army who is<br>competent to fight with Bhishma in battle, save thee, O tiger among men.<br>I say this truly.' Thus addressed by Partha, Sikhandin, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, quickly covered the grandsire with diverse kinds of<br>weapons. Disregarding those shafts, thy sire Devavrata began, with his<br>shafts, to check the angry Arjuna only in that battle. And that mighty<br>car-warrior, O sire, began also to despatch, with his shafts of keen<br>points, the whole army of the Pandavas to the other world. The Pandavas<br>also, O king, after the same manner, supported by their vast host, began<br>to overwhelm Bhishma like the clouds covering the maker of day. O bull of<br>Bharata's race, surrounded on all sides, that Bharata hero consumed many<br>brave warriors in that battle like a raging conflagration in the forest<br>(consuming numberless trees). The prowess that we then beheld there of<br>thy son (Dussasana) was wonderful, inasmuch as he battled with Partha and<br>protected the grandsire at the same time. With that feat of thy son<br>Dussasana, that illustrious bowman, all the people there were highly<br>gratified. Alone he battled with all the Pandavas having Arjuna amongst<br>them; and he fought with such vigour that the Pandavas were unable to<br>resist him. Many car-warriors were in that battle deprived of their cars<br>by Dussasana. And many mighty bowmen on horseback and many<br>mighty-warriors, elephants, pierced with Dussasana's keen shafts, fell<br>down on the earth. And many elephants, afflicted with his shafts, ran<br>away in all directions. As a fire fiercely blazeth forth with bright<br>flames when fed with fuel, so did thy son blaze forth, consuming the<br>Pandava host. And no car-warrior, O Bharata, of the Pandava host ventured<br>to vanquish or even proceed against that warrior of gigantic proportions,<br>save Indra's son (Arjuna) owning white steeds and having Krishna for his<br>charioteer. Then Arjuna also called Vijaya, vanquishing Dussasana in<br>battle, O king, in the very sight of all the troops, proceeded against<br>Bhishma. Though vanquished, thy son, however, relying upon the might of<br>Bhishma's arms, repeatedly comforted his own side and battled with the<br>Pandavas with great fierceness. Arjuna, O king, fighting with his foes in<br>that battle, looked exceedingly resplendent.[482] Then Sikhandin, in that<br>battle, O king, pierced the grandsire with many arrows whose touch<br>resembled that of the bolts of heaven and which were as fatal as the<br>poison of the snake. These arrows, however, O monarch, caused thy sire<br>little pain, for the son of Ganga received them laughingly. Indeed, as a<br>person afflicted with heat cheerfully receives torrents of rain, even so<br>did the son of Ganga received those arrows of Sikhandin. And the<br>Kshatriyas there, O king, beheld Bhishma in that great battle as a being<br>of fierce visage who was incessantly consuming the troops of the<br>high-souled Pandavas.<br><br>"Then thy son (Duryodhana), addressing all his warriors, said unto them,<br>'Rush ye against Phalguni from all sides. Bhishma, acquainted with the<br>duties of a commander, will protect you'. Thus addressed, the Kaurava<br>troops casting off all fear, fought with the Pandavas. (And once more,<br>Duryodhana said unto them). 'With his tall standard bearing the device of<br>the golden palmyra, Bhishma stayeth, protecting the honour and the armour<br>of all the Dhartarashtra warriors. The very gods, striving vigorously,<br>cannot vanquish the illustrious and mighty Bhishma. What need be said,<br>therefore, of the Parthas who are mortals? Therefore, ye warriors, fly<br>not away from the field, getting Phalguni for a foe. I myself, striving<br>vigorously, will today fight with the Pandavas.. uniting with all of you,<br>ye lords of earth, exerting yourselves actively.' Hearing these words, O<br>monarch, of thy son with bow in hand, many mighty combatants, excited<br>with rage, belonging to the Videhas, the Kalingas, and the diverse tribes<br>of the Daserkas, fell upon Phalguni. And many combatants also, belonging<br>to the Nishadas, the Sauviras, the Valhikas, the Daradas, the Westerners,<br>the Northerners, the Malavas, the Abhighatas, the Surasenas, the Sivis,<br>the Vasatis, the Salwas, the Sakas, the Trigartas, the Amvashthas, and<br>the Kekayas, similarly fell upon Partha, like flights of insects upon a<br>fire. The mighty Dhananjaya, otherwise called Vibhatsu, then, O monarch,<br>calling to mind diverse celestial weapons and aiming them at those great<br>car-warriors at the heads of their respective divisions,[483] quickly<br>consumed them all, by means of those weapons of great force, like fire<br>consuming a flight of insects. And while that firm bowman was (by means<br>of his celestial weapons) creating thousands upon thousands of arrows,<br>his Gandiva looked highly resplendent in the welkin. Then those<br>Kshatriyas, O monarch, afflicted with those arrows with their tall<br>standards torn and overthrown, could not even together, approach the<br>ape-bannered (Partha). Car-warriors fell down with their standards, and<br>horsemen with their horses, and elephant-riders with their elephants,<br>attacked by Kiritin with his shafts. And the earth was soon covered all<br>on all sides with the retreating troops of those kings, routed in<br>consequence of the shafts shot from Arjuna's arms. Partha then, O<br>monarch, having routed the Kaurava army, sped many arrows at Dussasana.<br>Those arrows with iron heads, piercing thy son Dussasana through, all<br>entered the earth like snakes through ant-hills. Arjuna then slew<br>Dussasana's steeds and then felled his charioteer. And the lord Arjuna,<br>with twenty shafts, deprived Vivingsati of his car, and struck him five<br>straight shafts. And piercing Kripa and Vikarna and Salya with many<br>arrows made wholly of iron, Kunti's son owning white steeds deprived all<br>of them of their cars. Thus deprived of their cars and vanquished in<br>battle by Savyasachin, Kripa and Salya, O sire, and Dussasana, and<br>Vikarna and Vivingsati, all fled away. Having vanquished those mighty<br>car-warriors, O chief of the Bharatas, in the forenoon, Partha blazed up<br>in that battle like a smokeless conflagration. Scattering his shafts all<br>around like the Sun shedding rays of light, Partha felled many other<br>kings, O monarch. Making those mighty car-warriors turn their backs upon<br>the field by means of his arrowy showers, Arjuna caused a large river of<br>bloody current to flow in that battle between the hosts of the Kurus and<br>the Pandavas, O Bharata. Large numbers of elephants and steeds and<br>car-warriors were slain by car-warriors. And many were the car-warriors<br>slain by elephants, and many also were the steeds slain by foot-soldiers.<br>And the bodies of many elephant-riders and horsemen and car-warriors, cut<br>off in the middle, as also their heads, fell down on every part of the<br>field. And the field of battle, O king, was strewn with (slain)<br>princes,&#8212;mighty car-warriors,&#8212;falling or fallen, decked with ear-rings<br>and bracelets. And it was also strewn with the bodies of many warriors<br>cut off by car-wheels, or trodden down by elephants. And foot-soldiers<br>ran away, and horsemen also with their horses. And many elephants and<br>car-warriors fell down on all sides. And many cars, with wheels and yokes<br>and standards broken, lay scattered all about on the field. And the field<br>of battle, dyed with the gore of large numbers of elephants, steeds, and<br>car-warriors, looked beautiful like a red cloud, in the autumnal sky.<br>Dogs, and crows, and vultures, and wolves, and jackals, and many other<br>frightful beasts and birds, set up loud howls, at the sight of the food<br>that lay before them. Diverse kinds of winds blew along all directions.<br>And Rakshasas and evil spirits were seen there, uttering loud roars. And<br>strings, embroidered with gold, and costly banners, were seen to wave,<br>moved by the wind. And thousands of umbrellas and great cars with<br>standards attached to them, were seen lying scattered about on the field.<br>Then Bhishma, O king, invoking a celestial weapon, rushed at the son of<br>Kunti, in the very sight of all the bowmen. Thereupon Sikhandin, clad in<br>mail, rushed at Bhishma who was dashing towards Arjuna. At this, Bhishma<br>withdrew that weapon resembling fire (in effulgence and energy).<br>Meanwhile Kunti's son owning white steeds slaughtered thy troops,<br>confounding the grandsire.[484]"
