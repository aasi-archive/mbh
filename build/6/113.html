                            Sanjaya said, "The heroic Drona, that great bowman endued with the<br>prowess of an infuriate elephant, that foremost of men possessed of great<br>might, taking up his large bow which was capable [of] checking even an<br>infuriate elephant, and shaking it (in his hands), was engaged in<br>afflicting the Pandava ranks, having penetrated into their midst. That<br>valiant warrior acquainted with every omen, beholding the omens on all<br>sides, addressed his son who also was scorching the hostile ranks and<br>said these words, 'This is that day, O son, on which the mighty Partha,<br>desirous of slaying Bhishma in battle, will exert himself to the best of<br>his might. My arrows are coming out (of the quiver, of their own accord).<br>My bow seems to yawn. My weapon seems unwilling to obey my behests, and<br>my heart also is cheerless. Animals and birds are uttering fearful and<br>incessant cries. Vultures seem to disappear beneath the feet of the<br>Bharata troops. The Sun himself seems to have lost hue. The quarters are<br>all ablaze. The Earth seems to shriek, inspire fear, and tremble<br>everywhere. Kankas, and vultures, and cranes are frequently crying.<br>Jackals are uttering inauspicious and fierce yells foreboding great<br>danger. Large meteors seem to fall from the centre of the solar disc. The<br>constellation called Parigha, with a trunkless form, appeareth around the<br>Sun. The solar and the lunar discs have become awful, foreboding great<br>danger to Kshatriyas about the mangling of their bodies. The idols of the<br>Kuru king in his temples tremble and laugh and dance and weep. The<br>illustrious Moon riseth with his horns downward. The bodies of the kings<br>belonging to the Kuru army all seem to be pale, and though clad in mail,<br>are shorn of splendour. The loud blare of Panchajanya and the twang of<br>Gandiva are heard on all sides of both the armies. Without doubt, Arjuna,<br>relying upon his great weapons and avoiding other warriors will advance<br>upon the grandsire. The pores of my body are contracting, and my heart<br>also is depressed, thinking, O mighty-armed one, of the encounter between<br>Bhishma and Arjuna. Keeping on his fore the Panchala prince of sinful<br>soul and conversant with deceit, Partha is proceeding towards Bhishma for<br>battle. Bhishma said before that he would not slay Sikhandin. By the<br>Creator had that one been made female, though through chance he<br>subsequently became a male person. That mighty son of Yajnasena is also<br>an inauspicious omen (by himself). The son of the Ocean-going (Ganga)<br>will not strike that person of inauspicious self. Thinking of this, viz.,<br>that Arjuna, excited with wrath, is about to fall upon the aged Kuru<br>grandsire, my heart is exceedingly depressed. The wrath of Yudhishthira,<br>an encounter between Bhishma and Arjuna in battle, and an endeavour like<br>this (of the shooting of weapons) by myself,&#8212;these (three) are certainly<br>fraught with great harm to creatures. Arjuna is endued with great energy;<br>he is powerful, brave, accomplished in weapons, and possessed of valour<br>that is very active. Capable of shooting his arrows to a great distance<br>and shooting them with force, he is, besides, acquainted with omens,<br>Endued with great might and intelligence, and above fatigue, that<br>foremost of warriors is incapable of defeat by the very gods with Vasava<br>at their head. The son of Pandu possesses terrible weapons and is ever<br>victorious in battle. Avoiding his path, go thou to battle (for Bhishma's<br>victory) O thou of rigid vows.[478] Today in this dreadful battle thou<br>wilt behold a great carnage. The beautiful and costly coats of mail,<br>decked with gold, of brave warriors will be pierced with straight shafts.<br>And the tops of standards, and bearded javelins, and bows, and bright<br>lances of sharp points, and darts bright with gold, and the standards on<br>the backs of elephants, will all be cut off by Kiritin in wrath. O son,<br>this is not the time when dependants should take care of their lives. Go<br>to battle, keeping heaven before thee, and for the sake of fame and<br>victory. There, the ape-bannered (Arjuna) crosseth on his car the river<br>of battle that is awful and incapable of being easily crossed, and hath<br>cars, elephants, and steeds, for its eddies. Regard for Brahmanas,<br>self-restraint, liberality, asceticism, and noble conduct, are seen in<br>Yudhishthira alone who hath for his brothers Dhananjaya, and the mighty<br>Bhimasena, and the twin sons of Madri by Pandu, and who hath Vasudeva of<br>the Vrishni race for his protector. The wrath, born of grief, of that<br>Yudhishthira whose body hath been purified by the flames of penance,<br>directed to the wicked-souled son of Dhritarashtra, is consuming this<br>Bharata host. There cometh Partha, having Vasudeva for his protector,<br>checking (as he cometh) this entire Dhartarashtra army. Behold, Kiritin<br>is agitating this host like a large whale agitating the vast sea of<br>crested waves. Hark, cries of distress and woe are heard in the van of<br>the army. Go, encounter the heir of the Panchala king. As for myself, I<br>will proceed against Yudhishthira. The heart of king Yudhishthira's very<br>strong array is difficult of access. Inaccessible as the interior of the<br>sea, it is guarded on all sides by Atirathas. Satyaki, and Abhimanyu and<br>Dhrishtadyumna, and Vrikodara, and the twins, even these are protecting<br>that ruler of men, viz., king Yudhishthira. Dark as the younger brother<br>of Indra, and risen like a tall Sala, behold Abhimanyu advancing at the<br>head of the (Pandava) host, like a second Phalguna! Take up thy mighty<br>weapons, and with thy large bow in hand proceed against the royal son of<br>Prishata (viz., Sikhandin), and against Vrikodara. Who is there that doth<br>not wish his dear son to live for many years? Keeping the duties of a<br>Kshatriya, however, before me, I am engaging thee (to this task). So<br>Bhishma also, in this battle, is consuming the mighty host of the<br>Pandavas. O son, he is, in battle, equal to Yama or Varuna himself.'"
