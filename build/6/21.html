                            Sanjaya said,&#8212;"Beholding the vast Dhartarashtra army ready for battle,<br>king Yudhisthira, the son of Kunti, gave way to grief. Seeing that<br>impenetrable array formed by Bhishma and regarding it as really<br>impenetrable, the king became pale and addressed Arjuna, saying,&#8212;O,<br>mighty-armed Dhananjaya, how shall we be able to fight in battle with the<br>Dhartarashtras who have the Grandsire for their (chief) combatant?<br>Immovable and impenetrable is this array that hath been designed,<br>according to the rules laid down in the scriptures, by that grinder of<br>foes, Bhishma, of transcendent glory. With our troops we have become<br>doubtful (of success), O grinder of foes. How, indeed, will victory be<br>ours in the face of this mighty array?'&#8212;Thus addressed, that slayer of<br>foes Arjuna answered Yudhisthira, the son of Pritha, who had been plunged<br>into grief at sight, O king, of thy army, in these words,&#8212;Hear, O king,<br>how soldiers that are few in number may vanquish the many that are<br>possessed of every quality. Thou art without malice; I shall, therefore,<br>tell thee means, O king. The Rishi Narada knows it, as also both Bhishma<br>and Drona. Referring to this means, the Grandsire himself in days of old<br>on the occasion of the battle between the Gods and the Asuras said unto<br>Indra and the other celestials.&#8212;They that are desirous of victory do not<br>conquer by might and energy so much as by truth, compassion,<br>righteousness and energy.[112] Discriminating then between righteousness,<br>and unrighteousness, and understanding what is meant by covetousness and<br>having recourse to exertion fight without arrogance, for victory is there<br>where righteousness is.&#8212;For this know, O king, that to us victory is<br>certain in (this) battle. Indeed, as Narada said,&#8212;There is victory where<br>Krishna is.&#8212;Victory is inherent to Krishna. Indeed, it followeth<br>Madhava. And as victory is one of its attributes, so humility is his<br>another attribute. Govinda is possessed of energy that is infinite. Even<br>in the midst of immeasurable foes he is without pain. He is the most<br>eternal of male beings. And there victory is where Krishna is. Even he,<br>indestructible and of weapons incapable of being baffled, appearing as<br>Hari in olden days, said in a loud voice unto the Gods and the<br>Asuras,&#8212;Who amongst you would be victorious?&#8212;Even the conquered who<br>said.&#8212;With Krishna in the front we will conquer.[113]&#8212;And it was<br>through Hari's grace that the three worlds were obtained by the gods<br>headed by Sakra. I do not, therefore, behold the slightest cause of<br>sorrow in thee, thee that hast the Sovereign of the Universe and the Lord<br>himself of the celestials for wishing victory to thyself."
