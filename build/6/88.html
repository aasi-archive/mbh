                            Sanjaya said, "Having passed the night in sound steep, those rulers of<br>men, the Kauravas and the Pandavas, once more proceeded to battle. And<br>when the troops of both armies were about to proceed to the field, great<br>was the uproar heard there, resembling the loud uproar of the ocean<br>itself. Then king Duryodhana, and Chitrasena, and Vivinsati, and that<br>foremost of car-warriors, viz., Bhishma and Bharadwaja's son possessed of<br>great prowess,&#8212;those mighty car-warriors, clad in mail and uniting<br>together, O King, formed with great care the array of the Kauravas<br>against the Pandavas. Having formed that mighty array fierce as the ocean<br>and having for its billows and current its steeds and elephants, thy sire<br>Bhishma, the son of Santanu, then, O king, proceeded in the van of the<br>whole army, supported by the Malavas, and the inhabitants of the southern<br>countries, and the Avantis. Next to him was the valiant son of<br>Bharadwaja, accompanied by the Pulindas, the Paradas, and the<br>Kshudraka-Malavas. Next to Drona was the valiant Bhagadatta. O king,<br>firmly resolved on fight, accompanied by the Magadhas, the Kalingas, and<br>the Pisachas. Behind Bhagadatta was Vrihadvala the king of the Kosalas<br>accompanied by the Melakas, the Tripuras, and the Chichilas. Next to<br>Vrihadvala was the brave Trigarta, the ruler of the Prasthala,<br>accompanied by a large number of the Kamvojas, and by Yavanas in<br>thousands. Next to the ruler of the Trigartas, O Bharata, proceeded that<br>mighty hero, viz., the son of Drona, uttering leonine roars and filling<br>the earth with those shouts. Next to Drona's son proceeded king<br>Duryodhana with the whole army, surrounded by his uterine brothers.<br>Behind Duryodhana proceeded Kripa the son of Saradwat. It was thus that<br>that mighty array, resembling the very ocean, advanced (to battle). And<br>standards and white umbrellas, O lord, and beautiful bracelets and costly<br>bows shed their effulgence there. And beholding that mighty array of thy<br>forces, that great car-warrior Yudhishthira, speedily addressed the<br>generalissimo (of his forces), viz., Prishata's son saying, 'Behold, O<br>great bowman, that array, already formed, resembling the ocean. Do thou<br>also, O son of Prishata, form without delay thy counter-array. (Thus<br>addressed), the heroic son of Prishata, O great king, formed that<br>terrible array called Sringataka that is destructive of all hostile<br>arrays. At the horns were Bhimasena and that mighty car-warrior, viz.,<br>Satyaki, with many thousands of cars as also of horse and infantry. Next<br>to them was that foremost of men, (viz., Arjuna) of white steeds and<br>having Krishna for his charioteer.[427] In the centre were king<br>Yudhishthira and the twin sons of Pandu by Madri. Other royal bowmen,<br>conversant with the science of arrays, with their troops, filled up that<br>array. In the rear were ordered Abhimanyu, and that mighty car-warrior,<br>Virata, and the sons of Draupadi and the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha. Thus, O<br>Bharata, having formed their mighty array, the heroic Pandavas waited on<br>the field, longing for battle and desirous of victory. And the loud noise<br>of drums mingling with the blare of conches and leonine roars and shouts<br>(of the combatants) and the slapping of their armpits, became terrible<br>and filled all the points of the compass. Then those brave warriors,<br>approaching one another for battle, looked at one another, O king, with<br>winkless eyes. Then O ruler of men, the warriors, first challenging each<br>other by name, engaged with each other.[428] Then commenced a fierce and<br>terrible battle between thy troops and those of the foe striking one<br>another. And in that battle, O Bharata, whetted shafts fell in showers<br>like terrible snakes with mouths wide open. And polished darts of<br>impetuous force, washed with oil, O king, shone like the effulgent<br>flashes of lightning from the clouds. And maces decked with gold and<br>attached to bright slings were seen to fall all over the field,<br>resembling beautiful crests of hills. And sabres of the colour of the<br>clear (blue) sky, O Bharata, and shields of bull's hides and decked with<br>a hundred moons, as they fell everywhere over the field, O king, looked<br>beautiful. And as the two armies, O king, were engaged in battle with<br>each other, they looked resplendent like the celestial and the demoniac<br>hosts battling with each other. All around they rushed against one<br>another in battle. Foremost of royal car-warriors, impetuously dashing<br>against car-warriors in that dreadful battle, fought on, with the yokes<br>of their cars entangled with those of their adversaries. And, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, all over the field flashes of fire mixed with smoke were<br>generated, in consequence of friction, in the tusks of battling<br>elephants. And combatants on the backs of elephants, struck with lances,<br>were seen all around to fall down like blocks (loosened) from crests of<br>hills.[429] And brave foot-soldiers, battling with their bare arms or<br>with lances, and striking one another, looked exceedingly beautiful. And<br>the warriors of the Kaurava and the Pandava hosts, coming upon one<br>another in that conflict, despatched one another with diverse kinds of<br>shafts to the abode of Yama. Then Bhishma, the son of Santanu, filling<br>(the air) with the rattle of his car, and depriving the foe of his senses<br>by the twang of his bow, rushed against the Pandavas in battle. The<br>car-warriors of the Pandavas, too, headed by Dhrishtadyumna, uttering<br>fierce shouts, rushed at him, firmly resolved on fight. Then commenced, O<br>Bharata, a battle between the infantry, car-warriors, and elephants, of<br>theirs and thine, in which the combatants became all entangled with one<br>another."
