                            "Sanjaya said,&#8212;'After Santanu's son Bhishma, O monarch, had become<br>silent, all those rulers of earth, there present, then returned to their<br>respective quarters. Hearing of Bhishma's slaughter that bull among men,<br>viz., Radha's son (Karna), partially inspired with fear quickly came<br>there. He beheld that illustrious hero lying on his bed of reeds. Then<br>Vrisha (Karna) endued with great glory, with voice choked in tears,<br>approaching that hero lying with eyes closed, fell at his feet. And he<br>said,&#8212;O chief of the Kurus, I am Radha's son, who while before thy eyes,<br>was everywhere looked upon by thee with hate!&#8212;Hearing these words, the<br>aged chief of the Kurus, the son of Ganga, whose eyes were covered with<br>film slowly raising his eyelids, and causing the guards to be removed,<br>and seeing the place deserted by all, embraced Karna with one arm, like a<br>sire embracing his son, and said these words with great affection:&#8212;Come,<br>come! Thou art an opponent of mine who always challengest comparison with<br>me! If thou hadst not come to me, without doubt, it would not have been<br>well with thee! Thou art Kunti's son, not Radha's! Nor is Adhiratha thy<br>father! O thou of mighty arms, I heard all this about thee from Narada as<br>also from Krishna-Dwaipayana! Without doubt, all this is true! I tell<br>thee truly, O son, that I bear thee no malice! It was only for abating<br>thy energy that I used to say such harsh words to thee! O thou of<br>excellent vows without any reason thou speakest ill of all the Pandavas!<br>Sinfully didst thou come into the world. It is for this that thy heart<br>hath been such. Through pride, and owning also to thy companionship with<br>the low, thy heart hateth even persons of merit! It is for this that I<br>spoke such harsh words about thee in the Kuru camp! I know thy prowess in<br>battle, which can with difficulty be borne on earth by foes! I know also<br>thy regard for Brahmanas. thy courage, and thy great attachment to<br>alms-giving! O thou that resemblest a very god, amongst men there is none<br>like thee! For fear of intestine dissensions I always spoke harsh words<br>about thee. In bowmanship, in aiming weapon, in lightness of hand and in<br>strength of weapons, thou art equal to Phalguni himself, or the<br>high-souled Krishna! O Karna, proceeding to the city of Kasi, alone with<br>thy bow, thou hadst crushed the kings in battle for procuring a bride for<br>the Kuru king! The mighty and invincible king Jarasandha also, ever<br>boastful of his prowess in battle, could not become thy match in fight!<br>Thou art devoted to Brahmanas; thou always fightest fairly! In energy and<br>strength, thou art equal to a child of the celestials and certainly much<br>superior to men. The wrath I cherished against thee is gone. Destiny is<br>incapable of being avoided by exertion. O slayer of foes, the heroic sons<br>of Pandu are thy uterine brothers! If thou wishest to do what is<br>agreeable to me, unite with them, O thou of mighty arms! O son of Surya,<br>let these hostilities end with me! Let all the kings of Earth be to-day<br>freed from danger!&#8212;<br><br>"'Karna said I know this, O thou of mighty arms! All this without doubt,<br>is (as thou sayest)! As thou tellest me, O, Bhishma, I am Kunti's son,<br>and not the son of a Suta! I was, however, abandoned by Kunti, and I have<br>been reared by a Suta. Having (so long) enjoyed the wealth of Duryodhana,<br>I dare not falsify it now. Like Vasudeva's son who is firmly resolved for<br>the sake of the Pandavas, I also, O thou that makest profuse presents to<br>Brahmanas, am prepared to cast away my possessions, my body itself, my<br>children, and my wife, for Duryodhana's sake! Death from disease, O thou<br>of Kuru's race, doth not become a Kshatriya! Relying upon Suyodhana I<br>have always offended the Pandavas! This affairs is destined to take its<br>course. It is incapable of being prevented. Who was there that would<br>venture to overcome Destiny by exertion? Various omens indicating the<br>destruction of the Earth. O grandsire, were noticed by thee and declared<br>in the assembly. It is well known to me that the son of Pandu, and<br>Vasudeva, are incapable of being conquered by other men. Even with them<br>we venture to fight! I will vanquish the son of Pandu in battle! Even<br>this is my firm resolve! I am not capable, of casting off this fierce<br>animosity (that I cherish against the Pandavas)! With a cheerful heart,<br>and keeping the duties of my order before my eye, I will contend against<br>Dhananjaya. Firmly resolved that I am on battle, grant me thy permission,<br>O hero! I will fight. Even this is my wish. It behoveth thee to forgive<br>me also any harsh words that I may have at any time uttered against thee<br>or any act that I may have done against thee from anger or<br>inconsiderateness!&#8212;"<br><br>"'Bhishma said,&#8212;If, indeed, thou art unable to cast off this fierce<br>animosity, I permit thee, O Karna! Fight, moved by the desire of heaven!<br>Without anger and without vindictiveness, serve thou the king according<br>to thy power and according to thy courage and observant of the conduct of<br>the righteous! Have then my permission, O Karna! Obtain thou that which<br>thou seekest! Through Dhananjaya thou wilt obtain all those regions<br>(hereafter) which are capable of being had by fulfilling the duties of a<br>Kshatriya! Freed from pride, and relying on thy (own) might and energy,<br>engage in battle, since a Kshatriya cannot have a (source of) greater<br>happiness than a righteous battle. For a long while I made great efforts<br>for bringing about peace! But I succeeded not, O Karna, in the task!<br>Truly do I say this unto thee!&#8212;"<br><br>"'Sanjaya continued,&#8212;'After the son of Ganga had said this, Radha's son<br>(Karna) having saluted Bhishma and obtained his forgiveness, got up on<br>his car and proceeded towards (the quarters of) thy son.'<br><br>The End of Bhishma Parva
