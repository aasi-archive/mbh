                            Sanjaya said, "King Virata then pierced that mighty car-warrior, viz.,<br>Bhishma, with three shafts. And that great car-warrior pierced his<br>(antagonist's) steeds also with three shafts furnished with golden wings.<br>And that terrible bowman and mighty car-warrior of firm hand, viz.,<br>Drona's son, pierced with six shafts the wielder of Gandiva between his<br>two breasts. Thereupon that grinder of foes, viz., Phalguni, that slayer<br>of hostile heroes, cut off Aswatthaman's bow and deeply pierced him in<br>return with five shafts. Deprived of his senses by anger, and unable to<br>bear the cutting off of his bow in that battle, Drona's son, taking up<br>another bow that was tougher, pierced Phalguni, O king, with ninety<br>sharp-shafts, and Vasudeva also with seventy fierce arrows. Then, with<br>eyes red in wrath, Phalguni, with Krishna, breathing long and hot<br>breaths, reflected for a moment. Firmly grasping the bow with his left<br>hand, that grinder of foes, viz., the wielder of gandiva excited with<br>rage, fixed on his bowstring a number of fierce shafts, sharp and<br>perfectly straight, and capable of taking (the foe's) life. And that<br>foremost of mighty men speedily pierced Drona's son, in that battle, with<br>those arrows. And those arrows, penetrating through his armour, drank his<br>life-blood. But though thus pierced by the wielder of Gandiva, Drona's<br>son wavered not. Shooting in return similar arrows at Partha, he stayed<br>unperturbed, in that battle, desirous, O king, of protecting Bhishma of<br>high vows. And that feat of his was applauded by the foremost warriors of<br>the Kuru army, consisting, as it did, of his having encountered the two<br>Krishnas united together. Indeed, Aswatthaman daily battled fearlessly<br>amid the forces, having obtained from Drona all weapons with the methods<br>also of their withdrawal. This one is the son of my preceptor. He is<br>again the dear son of Drona. He is especially a Brahmana, and, therefore,<br>worthy of my regard. Thinking so, that scorcher of foes, the heroic<br>Vibhatsu, that foremost of car-warriors, showed mercy to the son of<br>Bharadwaja. Avoiding the son of Drona, Kunti's son endued with great<br>prowess and having white steeds (yoked unto his car), began to fight,<br>displaying great quickness of arms and causing a great carnage of thy<br>troops. Duryodhana then pierced that great bowman Bhima with ten shafts<br>winged with vulturine feathers, adorned with gold, and whetted on stone.<br>Thereupon Bhimasena, excited with wrath, took up a tough and well-adorned<br>bow capable of taking the life of the foe, and also ten sharp shafts. And<br>steadily aiming those sharp-pointed shafts of fierce energy and impetuous<br>velocity, and drawing the bow-string to his ear, he deeply pierced the<br>king of the Kurus in his wide chest. Thereupon the gem hanging on his<br>breast on threads of gold, surrounded by those shafts, looked beautiful<br>like the Sun in the firmament surrounded by the planets. Thy son,<br>however, endued with great energy, thus struck by Bhimasena, could not<br>bear it (coolly), like a snake unable to bear the sounds of a man's slap.<br>Excited with wrath and desirous of protecting his army, he then pierced<br>Bhima in return, O king, with many shafts whetted on stone and endued<br>with golden wings. Thus struggling in battle and mangling each other<br>fiercely, those two mighty sons of thine looked like a pair of celestials.<br><br>"That tiger among men and slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son of<br>Subhadra, pierced Chitrasena with many sharp shafts and Purumitra also<br>with seven shafts. And piercing Satyavrata too with seventy shafts, that<br>hero resembling Indra himself in battle, began as it were to dance on the<br>field, and caused us much pain. Chitrasena then pierced him in return<br>with ten shafts, and Satyavrata with nine, and Purumitra with seven. Then<br>the son of Arjuna, thus pierced, while yet covered with blood, cut off<br>the large and beautiful bow of Chitrasena that was capable of checking<br>foes. And cutting through his coat of mail he pierced his antagonist's<br>breast with a shaft. Then the princes of thy army, all heroic and mighty<br>car-warriors, excited with wrath and united together in that conflict,<br>pierced him with sharp arrows. And Abhimanyu, acquainted with the<br>mightiest weapons, smote them all with keen shafts. Beholding that feat<br>of his, thy sons then surrounded the son of Arjuna, who was consuming thy<br>army in that conflict like a swelling fire of blazing flames consuming a<br>heap of dry grass in summer. And the son of Subhadra, while smiting thy<br>troops (thus), seemed to glow in splendour. Seeing that conduct of his,<br>thy grandson Lakshmana then, O monarch, quickly fell upon the son of<br>Subhadra. Thereupon that mighty car-warrior Abhimanyu, excited with<br>wrath, pierced Lakshmana graced with auspicious marks, as also his<br>charioteer, with six sharp arrows. But Lakshmana also, O king, pierced<br>Subhadra's son with many keen shafts. And that feat, O king, seemed to be<br>highly wonderful. Then that mighty car-warrior, viz., Abhimanyu, slaying<br>the four steeds as also the charioteer of Lakshmana with sharp shafts,<br>rushed towards the latter. Thereupon Lakshmana, that slayer of hostile<br>heroes, staying on that car of his whose steeds had been slain, and<br>excited with wrath, hurled a dart towards the car of Subhadra's son.<br>Abhimanyu, however, with his sharp arrows, cut off that irresistible dart<br>of fierce mien, resembling a snake, and coming impetuously towards him.<br>Then Kripa, taking Lakshmana up on his own car, bore him away from the<br>conflict, in the very sight of all the troops. Then when that awful<br>conflict became general, the combatants rushed against one another,<br>desirous of taking another's life. And the mighty bowmen of thy army and<br>the great car-warriors of the Pandava host, prepared to lay down their<br>lives in battle, slew one another. With hair dishevelled, divested of<br>their coats of mail, deprived of their cars, and their bows broken, the<br>Srinjayas fought with the Kurus with their bare arms. Then the<br>mighty-armed Bhishma, endued with great strength, and excited with wrath,<br>slew with his celestial weapons the troops of the high-souled Pandavas.<br>And the earth became covered with the fallen bodies of elephants deprived<br>of their guides of men and steeds and car-warriors and cavalry-soldiers."
