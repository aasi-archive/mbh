                            Dhritarashtra said, "How did the ruler of the Kalingas, that commander of<br>a large division, urged by my son, and supported by his troops, fight in<br>battle with the mighty Bhimasena of wonderful feats, that hero wandering<br>over the field of battle with his mace like Death himself club in hand?"<br><br>Sanjaya said, "Thus urged by thy son, O great king, the mighty king of<br>the Kalingas, accompanied by a large army advanced towards Bhima's car.<br>And Bhimasena, then, O Bharata, supported by the Chedis, rushed towards<br>that large and mighty army of the Kalingas, abounding with cars, steeds,<br>and elephants, and armed with mighty weapons, and advancing towards him<br>with Ketumat, the son of the king of the Nishadas. And Srutayus also,<br>excited with wrath, accoutred in mail, followed by his troops in<br>battle-array, and, accompanied by king Ketumat, came before Bhima in<br>battle. And the ruler of the Kalingas with many thousands of cars, and<br>Ketumat with ten thousand elephants and the Nishadas, surrounded<br>Bhimasena, O king, on all sides. Then the Chedis, the Matsyas, and<br>Karushas, with Bhimasena at their head, with many kings impetuously<br>rushed against the Nishadas. And then commenced the battle, fierce and<br>terrible, between the warriors rushing at one another from desire of<br>slaughter. And terrific was the battle that suddenly took place between<br>Bhima and his foes, resembling the battle, O great king, between Indra<br>and the mighty host of Diti's sons. And loud became the uproar, O<br>Bharata, of that mighty army struggling in battle, that resembled the<br>sound of the roaring ocean. And the combatants, O king, cutting one<br>another, made the whole field resemble a crematorium strewn with flesh<br>and blood. And combatants, impelled by the desire of slaughter could not<br>distinguish friend from foe. And those brave warriors, incapable of being<br>easily defeated in battle, even began to strike down their own friend.<br>And terrific was the collision that took place between the few and many,<br>between the Chedis (on the one side) and the Kalingas and the Nishadas, O<br>king, (on the other). Displaying their manliness to the best of their<br>power, the mighty Chedis, abandoning Bhimasena, turned back, and when the<br>Chedis ceased to follow him, the son of Pandu, encountering all the<br>Kalingas, did not turn back, depending upon the might of his own arms.<br>Indeed, the mighty Bhimasena moved not, but from the terrace of his car<br>covered the division of the Kalingas with showers of sharp arrows. Then<br>that mighty bowman, the king of the Kalingas, and that car-warrior, his<br>son known by the name of Sakradeva, both began to strike the son of Pandu<br>with their shafts. And the mighty-armed Bhima, shaking his beautiful bow,<br>and depending on the might of his own arms, fought with Kalinga, and<br>Sakradeva, shooting in that battle innumerable arrows, slew Bhimasena's<br>steeds with them. And beholding that chastiser of foes Bhimasena deprived<br>of his car, Sakradeva rushed at him, shooting sharp arrows. And upon<br>Bhimasena, O great king, the mighty Sakradeva showered arrowy downpours<br>like the clouds after summer is gone. But the mighty Bhimasena, staying<br>on his car whose steeds had been slain, hurled at Sakradeva a mace made<br>of the hardest iron. And slain by that mace, O king, the son of the ruler<br>of the Kalingas, from his car, fell down on the ground, with his standard<br>and charioteer. Then that mighty car-warrior, the king of the Kalingas<br>beholding his own son slain, surrounded Bhima on all sides with many<br>thousands of cars. Then the mighty-armed Bhima endued with great<br>strength, abandoning mace, took up a scimitar, desirous of achieving a<br>fierce feat. And that bull among men also took up, O king, crescents made<br>of gold. And the ruler of the Kalingas also, excited with wrath, and<br>rubbing his bowstring, and taking up a terrible arrow (deadly) as poison<br>of the snake, shot it at Bhimasena, desirous at that monarch was of<br>slaying (the Pandava). That sharp arrow, thus shot and coursing<br>impetuously, Bhimasena, O king, cut in twain with his huge sword. And<br>filled with delight he set up a loud shout, terrifying the troops. And<br>the ruler of the Kalingas, excited with rage in that combat with<br>Bhimasena, quickly hurled at him fourteen bearded darts whetted on stone.<br>The mighty-armed son of Pandu, however, with that best of scimitars,<br>fearlessly cut into fragments in a trice, O king, those darts while<br>coursing through the welkin and before they could reach him. And having<br>in that battle (thus) cut off those fourteen darts Bhima, that bull among<br>men, beholding Bhanumat, rushed at him. Bhanumat then covered Bhima with<br>a shower of arrows, and set up a loud shout, making the welkin resound<br>with it. Bhima, however, in that fierce battle, could not bear that<br>leonine shout. Himself endued with a loud voice, he also shouted very<br>loudly. And at these shouts of his, the army of the Kalingas became<br>filled with fear. In that battle they no longer regarded Bhima, O bull<br>among men, as a human being. Then, O great king, having uttered a loud<br>shout, Bhima, sword in hand impetuously jumping on (Bhanumat's) excellent<br>elephant aided by the latter's tusks, gained, O sire, the back of that<br>prince of tuskers, and with his huge sword cut Bhanumat, dividing him in<br>the middle. That chastiser of foes, then, having (thus) slain in battle<br>the prince of the Kalingas, next[363] made his sword which was capable of<br>bearing a great strain, to descend upon the neck of that elephant. His<br>head cut off, that prince of elephants fell down with a loud roar, like a<br>crested mountain (whose base is) eaten away by the impetuous (surges of<br>the) sea. And jumping down, O Bharata, from that failing elephant, the<br>prince of Bharata's race, of undepressed soul, stood on the ground, sword<br>in hand and accoutred in mail (as before). And felling numerous elephants<br>on all sides, he wandered (over the field), making many paths (for<br>himself). And then he seemed to be like a moving wheel of fire<br>slaughtering whole divisions of cavalry, of elephants, and cars, and<br>large bodies of infantry. And that lord among men, the mighty Bhima, was<br>seen to move over the field with the activity of the hawk, quickly<br>cutting off in that battle, with his sharp-edged sword, their bodies and<br>heads, as also those of the combatants on elephant. And combatant on<br>foot, excited with rage, all alone, and like Yama at the season of<br>universal dissolution, he struck terror into his foes and confounded<br>those brave warriors. Only they that were senseless rushed with loud<br>shouts at him wandering in that great battle with impetuosity, sword in<br>hand. And that grinder of foes, endued with great strength, cutting off<br>the shafts and yokes of warriors on their cars, slew those warriors also.<br>And Bhimasena was seen, O Bharata, to display diverse kinds of motions<br>there. He wheeled about, and whirled about on high, and, made<br>side-thrusts, and jumped forward, and ran above, and leapt high. And, O<br>Bharata, he was also seen to rush forward and rush upward. And some<br>mangled by the high-souled son of Pandu by means of his excellent sword,<br>shrieked aloud, struck at their vitals or fell down deprived of life. And<br>many elephants, O Bharata, some with trunks and the extremities of their<br>tusks cut off, and others having their temporal globes cut open, deprived<br>of riders, slew their own ranks and fell down uttering loud cries. And<br>broken lances, O king, and the head of elephant drivers, and beautiful<br>housings of elephants, and chords resplendent with gold, and collars, and<br>darts and mallets and quivers, diverse kinds of machines, and beautiful<br>bows, short arrows with polished heads, with hooks and iron crows for<br>guiding elephants, bells of diverse shape, and hilts decked with gold,<br>were seen by us falling down or (already) fallen along with riders of<br>steeds. And with elephants (lying down) having the fore parts and hind<br>parts of their bodies and their trunks cut off, or entirely slain, the<br>field seemed to be strewn with fallen cliffs. That bull among men, having<br>thus crushed the huge elephants, next crushed the steeds also. And, O<br>Bharata, that hero also felled the foremost of cavalry soldiers. And the<br>battle, O sire, that took place between him and them was fierce in the<br>extreme. And hilts and traces, and saddle girths resplendent with gold,<br>and covers for the back of steeds, and bearded darts, and costly swords,<br>and coats of mail, and shields, and beautiful ornaments, were seen by us<br>strewn over the ground in that great battle. And he caused the earth to<br>be strewn over (with blood) as if it were variegated with lilies. And the<br>mighty son of Pandu, jumping high and dragging some car-warriors down<br>with his sword felled them along with (their) standards. Frequently<br>jumping up or rushing on all sides, that hero endued with great activity,<br>wandering along many routes, caused the combatants to be amazed. And some<br>he slew by his legs, and dragging down others he pressed them down under<br>the earth. And others he cut off with his sword, and others he frightened<br>with his roars. And others he threw down on the ground by the force of<br>his thighs (as he ran). And others, beholding him, fled away in terror.<br>It was thus that that vast force of the Kalingas endued with great<br>activity, surrounding the terrible Bhimasena in battle, rushed at him.<br>Then, O bull of Bharata's race, beholding Srutayush at the head of<br>Kalinga troops, Bhimasena rushed at him. And seeing him advancing the<br>ruler of the Kalingas, of immeasurable soul, pierced Bhimasena between<br>his breasts with nine arrows. Struck with those shafts shot by the ruler<br>of the Kalingas, like an elephant pierced with the hook, Bhimasena blazed<br>up with wrath like fire fed with fuel. Then Asoka, that best of<br>charioteers, bringing a car decked with gold, caused Bhima to mount on<br>it. And thereupon that slayer of foes, the son of Kunti, speedily mounted<br>on that car. And then he rushed at the ruler of the Kalingas,<br>saying,&#8212;'Wait, Wait'. And then the mighty Srutayush excited with wrath,<br>shot at Bhima many sharp arrows, displaying his lightness of hand, and<br>that mighty warrior, Bhima, forcibly struck with those nine sharp arrows<br>shot by Kalinga from his excellent bow, yielded to great wrath, O king,<br>like a snake struck with a rod. Then that foremost of mighty men, Bhima,<br>the son of Pritha, excited with rage and drawing his bow with great<br>strength, slew the ruler of the Kalingas with seven shafts made wholly of<br>iron. And with two shafts he slew the two mighty protectors of the<br>car-wheels of Kalinga. And he also despatched Satyadeva and Satya to the<br>abode of Yama. Of immeasurable soul, Bhima also, with many sharp arrows<br>and long shafts, caused Ketumat to repair unto Yama's abode. Then the<br>Kshatriyas of the Kalinga country, excited with rage and supported by<br>many thousands of combatants, encountered the wrathful Bhimasena in<br>battle. And armed with darts and maces and scimitars and lances and<br>swords and battle-axes, the Kalingas, O king, hundreds upon hundreds<br>surrounded Bhimasena. Baffling that risen shower of arrows, that mighty<br>warrior then took up his mace and jumped down (from his car) with great<br>speed.[364] And Bhima then despatched seven hundred heroes to Yama's<br>abode. And that grinder of foes despatched, in addition, two thousand<br>Kalingas to the region of death. And that feat seemed highly wonderful.<br>And it was thus that the heroic Bhima of terrible prowess repeatedly<br>felled in battle large bands of the Kalingas. And elephants deprived by<br>Pandu's son, in that battle, of their riders, and afflicted with arrows<br>wandered on the field, treading down their own ranks and uttering loud<br>roars like masses of clouds driven by the wind. Then the mighty-armed<br>Bhima, scimitar in hand, and filled with delight, blew his conch of<br>terrible loudness. And with that blare he caused the hearts of all the<br>Kalinga troops to quake with fear. And, O chastiser of foes, all the<br>Kalingas seemed at the same time to be deprived of their senses. And all<br>the combatants and all the animals shook with terror. And in consequence<br>of Bhimasena wandering in that battle through many paths or rushing on<br>all sides like a prince of elephants, or frequently jumping up, a trance<br>seemed to be engendered there that deprived his foes of their senses. And<br>the whole (Kalinga) army shook with terror of Bhimasena, like a large<br>lake agitated by an alligator. And struck with panic in consequence of<br>Bhima of wonderful achievements, all the Kalinga combatants fled away in<br>all directions. When, however, they were rallied again, the commander of<br>the Pandava army (Dhrishtadyumna), O Bharata, ordered his own troops,<br>saying,&#8212;'Fight'. Hearing the words of their commander, many leaders (of<br>the Pandava army) headed by Sikhandin approached Bhima, supported by many<br>car-divisions accomplished in smiting. And Pandu's son, king Yudhishthira<br>the just, followed all of them with a large elephant force of the colour<br>of the clouds. And thus urging all his divisions, the son of Prishata,<br>surrounded by many excellent warriors, took upon himself the protection<br>of one of the wings of Bhimasena.[365] There exists nobody on earth, save<br>Bhima and Satyaki, who to the prince of the Panchalas is dearer than his<br>very life. That slayer of hostile heroes, the son of Prishata, beheld the<br>mighty-armed Bhimasena, that slayer of foes, wandering among the<br>Kalingas. He set up many shouts, O king, and was filled with delight, O<br>chastiser of foes. Indeed, he blew his conch in battle and uttered a<br>leonine roar. And Bhimasena also, beholding the red standard of<br>Dhrishtadyumna on his car decked with gold and unto which were yoked<br>steeds white as pigeons, became comforted.[366] And Dhrishtadyumna of<br>immeasurable soul, beholding Bhimasena encountered by the Kalingas rushed<br>to the battle for his rescue. And both those heroes. Dhrishtadyumna and<br>Vrikodara, endued with great energy, beholding Satyaki at a distance,<br>furiously encountered the Kalingas in battle. And that bull among men,<br>the grand son of Sini, that foremost of victorious warriors, quickly<br>advancing to the spot took up the wing of both Bhima and Prishata's son.<br>Bow in hand creating a great havoc there and making himself fierce in the<br>extreme, he began to slay the enemy in battle. And Bhima caused a river<br>to flow there of bloody current, mingled with the blood and flesh of the<br>warriors born in Kalinga. And beholding Bhimasena then, the troops cried<br>aloud, O king, saying. 'This is Death himself that is fighting in Bhima's<br>shape with the Kalingas.' Then Santanu's son Bhishma, hearing those cries<br>in battle, quickly proceeded towards Bhima, himself surrounded on all<br>sides with combatants in army. Thereupon, Satyaki and Bhimasena and<br>Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race, rushed towards that car of Bhima<br>decked with gold. And all of them quickly surrounding Ganga's son in<br>battle, pierced Bhishma, each with three terrible shafts, without losing<br>a moment. Thy sire Devavrata, however, in return pierced each of those<br>mighty bowmen striving (in battle) with three straight shafts. And<br>checking those mighty car-warriors, with thousands of arrows he Slew with<br>his shafts the steeds of Bhima decked with golden armour. Bhima, however,<br>endued with great energy, staying on that car whose steeds had been<br>slain, with great impetuosity hurled a dart at Bhishma's car. Thy sire<br>Devavrata then, in that battle, cut off that dart in twain before it<br>could reach him, and thereupon it fell down on the earth. Then that bull<br>among men, Bhimasena, taking up a heavy and mighty mace made of Saikya<br>iron speedily jumped down from his car. And Dhrishtadyumna quickly taking<br>up that foremost of car-warriors on his own car, took away, in the very<br>sight of all the combatants, that renowned warrior. And Satyaki then from<br>desire of doing what was agreeable to Bhima, felled with his shaft the<br>charioteer of the reverend Kuru grand-sire. Upon his charioteer being<br>slain, that foremost of car-warriors, Bhishma, was borne away from the<br>field of battle by his steeds with the speed of the wind. And when that<br>mighty car-warrior was (thus) taken away from the field, Bhimasena then,<br>O monarch, blazed up like a mighty fire while consuming dry grass. And<br>slaying all the Kalingas, he stayed in the midst of the troops, and none,<br>O bull of Bharata's race, of thy side ventured to withstand him. And<br>worshipped by the Panchalas and the Matsyas, O bull of Bharata's race, he<br>embraced Dhrishtadyumna and then approached Satyaki. And Satyaki, the<br>tiger among the Yadus, of prowess incapable of being baffled, then<br>gladdening Bhimasena, said unto him, in the presence of Dhrishtadyumna,<br>(these words). 'By good luck the king of the Kalingas, and Ketumat, the<br>prince of the Kalingas, and Sakradeva also of that country and all the<br>Kalingas, have been slain in battle. With the might and prowess of thy<br>arms, by thee alone, hath been crushed the very large division of the<br>Kalingas that abounded with elephants and steeds and cars, and with noble<br>warriors, and heroic combatants.' Having said this, the long-armed<br>grandson of Sini, that chastiser of foes, quickly getting upon his car,<br>embraced the son of Pandu. And then that mighty car-warrior, coming back<br>to his own car, began to slay thy troops excited with rage and<br>strengthening (the hands of) Bhima.
