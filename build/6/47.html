                            Sanjaya said,&#8212;"After the great part of the forenoon of that awful day<br>had worn out, in that terrific engagement, O king, that was (so)<br>destructive of foremost of men[333], Durmukha and Kritavarman, and Kripa,<br>and Salya, and Vivinsati, urged by thy son, approached Bhishma and began<br>to protect him. And protected by those five mighty car-warriors. O bull<br>of Bharata's race, that great car-warrior penetrated the Pandava host.<br>And the palmyra standard of Bhishma was seen to glide continually, O<br>Bharata, through the Chedis, the Kasis, the Karushas, and the Panchalas.<br>And that hero, with broad-headed shafts of great swiftness which were<br>again perfectly straight, cut off the heads (of foes) and their cars with<br>yokes and standards. And, O bull of Bharata's race, Bhishma seemed to<br>dance on his car as it coursed along its track. And some elephants,<br>struck (by him) in their vital parts, shrieked in agony. Then Abhimanyu<br>in great wrath, stationed on his car unto which were yoked excellent<br>steeds of a tawny hue, rushed towards Bhishma's car. And with his<br>standard adorned with pure gold and resembling a Karnikara tree, he<br>approached Bhishma and those (five) foremost of car-warriors. And<br>striking with a keen-edged shaft the standard of the palmyra-bannered<br>(warrior), that hero engaged in battle with Bhishma and those other<br>car-warriors that protected him.[334] Piercing Kritavarman with one<br>arrow, and Salya with five, he weakened his great-grandsire with nine<br>arrows. And with one arrow well shot from his bow drawn to its fullest<br>stretch, he cut off (his adversary's) standard adorned with pure gold.<br>And with one broad-headed shaft capable of penetrating every cover, which<br>was perfectly straight, he cut off from his body the head of Durmukha's<br>charioteer. And with another keen-edged arrow he cut in twain the<br>gold-decked bow of Kripa. And them also, with many sharp-pointed shafts,<br>that mighty car-warrior smote in great wrath, seeming to dance (the<br>while). And beholding his lightness of hand, the very gods were<br>gratified. And in consequence of Abhimanyu's sureness of aim, all the<br>car-warriors headed by Bhishma regarded him to be possessed of the<br>capacity of Dhananjaya himself.[335] And his bow, emitting a twang like<br>that of Gandiva, while stretched and re-stretched, seemed to revolve like<br>a circle of fire.[336] Bhishma then, that slayer of hostile heroes,<br>rushing on him impetuously, speedily pierced the son of Arjuna in that<br>combat with nine arrows. And he also, with three broad-headed shafts, cut<br>off the standard of that warrior of great energy. Of rigid vows, Bhishma<br>also struck his (adversary's) charioteer. And Kritavarman, and Kripa, and<br>Salya also, O sire, piercing Arjuna's son, all failed to make him waver,<br>for he stood firm like the Mainaka mountain. And the heroic son of<br>Arjuna, though surrounded by those mighty car-warriors of the<br>Dhartarashtra army, still showered on those five car-warriors arrowy<br>downpours. And baffling their mighty weapons by his arrowy showers, and<br>pouring on Bhishma his shafts, the powerful son of Arjuna set up loud<br>shout. And struggling in the battle thus and afflicting Bhishma with<br>(his) arrows, the strength we saw of his arms then was very great. But<br>though endued with such prowess Bhishma also shot his arrows at him. But<br>he cut off in that combat the arrows shot from Bhishma's bow. And then<br>that heroic warrior of arrows that were never lost, cut off with nine<br>arrows, in that combat, the standard of Bhishma. And at that feat the<br>people there set up a loud shout. Decked with jewels and made of silver,<br>that tall standard bearing the device of the palmyra, cut off, O Bharata,<br>by the shafts of Subhadra's son, fell down on the earth. And beholding, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, that standard failing in consequence of the<br>shafts of Subhadra's son, the proud Bhima set up a loud shout for<br>cheering the son of Subhadra. Then in fierce combat, the mighty Bhishma<br>caused many celestial weapons of great efficacy to appear. And the great<br>grandsire of immeasurable soul then covered Subhadra's son with thousands<br>of arrows. And at this, ten great bowmen and mighty car-warriors of the<br>Pandavas, quickly rushed on their cars for protecting the son of<br>Subhadra. And those were Virata with his son, and Dhrishtadyumna of<br>Prishata's race, and Bhima, the five Kekaya brothers, and Satyaki also, O<br>king. And as they were falling upon him with great impetuosity, Bhishma<br>the son of Santanu, in that conflict, pierced the prince of Panchala with<br>three arrows, and Satyaki with ten. And with one winged arrow, whetted<br>and sharp-edged as a razor, and shot from his bow drawn to its fullest<br>stretch, he cut off the standard of Bhimasena. And, O best of men, the<br>standard of Bhimasena, made of gold and bearing the device of a lion, cut<br>off by Bhishma, fell from the car. And Bhima then, piercing Santanu's son<br>Bhishma in that combat with three arrows, pierced Kripa with one, and<br>Kritavarman with eight. And Uttara also, the son of Virata, on a tusker<br>with upraised trunk, rushed against the ruler of the Madras. Salya,<br>however, succeeded in checking the unparalleled impetuosity of that<br>prince of elephants rushing quickly towards his car. That prince of<br>elephants, in great wrath, placing his leg upon the yoke of (Salya's)<br>car, killed his four large steeds of excellent speed. The ruler of the<br>Madras then, staying on that car whose steeds had been slain, hurled a<br>dart, all made of iron, and resembling a snake, for slaying Uttara<br>outright. The latter's coat of mail being cut through by that dart, he<br>became totally deprived of his senses and fell down from his elephant's<br>neck, with the hook and the lance loosened from his grasp. And Salya<br>then, taking up his sword and jumping down from his excellent car, and<br>putting forth his prowess, cut off the large trunk of that prince of<br>elephants. His coat of mail pierced all over with a shower of arrows, and<br>his trunk cut off, that elephant uttered a loud shriek and fell down and<br>expired. Achieving such a feat, O king, the ruler of the Madras speedily<br>mounted on the splendid car of Kritavarman. And beholding his brother<br>Uttara slain and seeing Salya staying with Kritavarman, Virata's son<br>Sweta blazed up in wrath, like fire (blazing up) with clarified butter.<br>And that mighty warrior, stretching his large bow that resembled the bow<br>of Sakra himself, rushed with the desire of slaying Salya the ruler of<br>the Madras. Surrounded on all sides with a mighty division of cars, he<br>advanced towards Salya's car pouring an arrowy shower. And beholding him<br>rush to the fight with prowess equal to that of an infuriate elephant,<br>seven car-warriors of thy side surrounded him on all sides, desirous of<br>protecting the ruler of Madras who seemed to be already within the jaws<br>of Death. And those seven warriors were Vrihadvala the ruler of the<br>Kosalas, and Jayatsena of Magadha, and Rukmaratha, O king, who was the<br>valourous son of Salya, and Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti, and Sudakshina<br>the king of the Kamvojas, and Jayadratha, the ruler of the Sindhus and<br>the kinsman of Vrihadkshatra. And the stretched bows of those high-souled<br>warriors, decorated with diverse colours, looked like the lightning's<br>flashes in the clouds. And they all poured on Sweta's head ceaseless<br>showers of arrows like the clouds tossed by the wind dropping rain on the<br>mountain breast on the expiry of summer. That mighty bowman and commander<br>of the forces, enraged at this, with seven broad-headed arrows of great<br>impetuosity, struck their bows, and then continued to grind them. And<br>those bows we saw were cut off, O Bharata, and thereupon they all took<br>up, within half the time taken up in a wink of the eye, other bows. And<br>they then shot at Sweta seven arrows. And once again that mighty-armed<br>warrior of immeasurable soul, with seven fleet shafts, cut off those<br>(other) bows of these bowmen. Those warriors then, whose large bows had<br>been cut off, those mighty car-warriors swelling (with rage), grasping<br>(seven) darts, set up a loud shout. And, O chief of the Bharatas, they<br>hurled those seven darts at Sweta's car. And those blazing darts which<br>coursed (through the air) like large meteors, with the sound of thunder,<br>were all cut off, before they could reach him, that warrior conversant<br>with mighty weapons, by means of seven broad-headed arrows. Then taking<br>up an arrow capable of penetrating into every part of the body, he shot<br>it, O chief of the Bharatas, at Rukmaratha. And that mighty arrow,<br>surpassing (the force of) the thunder-bolt, penetrated into the latter's<br>body. Then, O king, forcibly struck by that arrow, Rukmaratha sat down on<br>the terrace of his car and fell into a deadly swoon. His charioteer then,<br>without betraying any fear, bore him away, senseless and in a swoon, in<br>the very sight of all. Then taking up six other (arrows) adorned with<br>gold, the mighty-armed Sweta cut off the standard-tops of his six<br>adversaries. And that chastiser of foes then, piercing their steeds and<br>charioteers also, and covering those six warriors themselves with<br>ceaseless shafts, proceeded towards the car of Salya. And beholding that<br>generalissimo of the (Pandava) forces proceeding quickly towards Salya's<br>car, a loud uproar of oh and alas arose in thy army, O Bharata. Then thy<br>mighty son, with Bhishma at the head, and supported by heroic warriors<br>and many troops, proceeded towards Sweta's car.[337] And he (thus)<br>rescued the ruler of the Madras who had already entered the jaws of<br>Death. And then commenced a battle, terrific and making the hair stand on<br>end, between thy troops and those of the enemy, in which cars and<br>elephants all got mixed up in confusion. And upon Subhadra's son and<br>Bhimasena, and that mighty car-warrior Satyaki, and upon the ruler of the<br>Kekayas, and Virata, and Dhrishtadyumna of Prishatas' race, and upon the<br>Chedi troops, the old Kuru grandsire poured showers of arrows.[338]
