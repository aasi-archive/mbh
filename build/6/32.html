                            [(Bhagavad Gita Chapter VIII)]<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'What is that Brahman, what is Adhyatma, what is action, O<br>best of male beings? What also has been said to be Adhibhuta, and what is<br>called Adhidaiva? Who is here Adhiyajna, and how, in this body, O slayer<br>of Madhu? And how at the time of departure art thou to be known by those<br>that have restrained their self'?&#8212;<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'Brahman is the Supreme and indestructible. Adhyatma<br>is said to be its own manifestation. The offering (to any godhead in a<br>sacrifice) which causeth the production and development of all&#8212;this is<br>called action.[213] Remembering me alone in (his) last moments, he that,<br>casting off his body, departeth (hence), cometh into my essence. There is<br>no doubt in this. Whichever form (of godhead) one remembereth when one<br>casteth off, at the end, (his) body, unto that one he goeth, O son of<br>Kunti, having habitually meditated on it always. Therefore, think of me<br>at all times, and engage in battle. Fixing thy mind and understanding on<br>me, thou wilt, without doubt, come even to me. Thinking (of the Supreme)<br>with a mind not running to other objects and endued with abstraction in<br>the form of uninterrupted application, one goeth, O son of Pritha, unto<br>the Divine and Supreme male Being. He who at the time of his departure,<br>with a steady mind, endued with reverence, with power of abstraction, and<br>directing the life-breath called Prana between the eye-brows, thinketh of<br>that ancient seer, who is the ruler (of all), who is minuter than the<br>minutest atom, who is the ordainer of all, who is inconceivable in form,<br>and who is beyond all darkness, cometh unto that Divine and Supreme Male<br>Being, I will tell thee in brief about that seat which persons conversant<br>with the Vedas declare to be indestructible, which is entered by ascetics<br>freed from all longings, and in expectation of which (people) practise<br>the vows of Brahmacharins. Casting off (this) body, he who departeth,<br>stopping up all the doors, confining the mind within the heart, placing<br>his own life-breath called Prana between the eye-brows, resting on<br>continued meditation, uttering this one syllable Om which is Brahman, and<br>thinking of me, attaineth to the highest goal.[214] He who always<br>thinketh of me with mind ever withdrawn from all other objects, unto that<br>devotee always engaged on meditation, I am, O Partha, easy of access.<br>High-souled persons who have achieved the highest perfection, attaining<br>to me, do not incur re-birth which is the abode of sorrow and which is<br>transient, All the worlds, O Arjuna, from the abode of Brahman downwards<br>have to go through a round of births, on attaining to me, however, O son<br>of Kunti, there is no re-birth.[215] They who know a day of Brahman to<br>end after a thousand Yugas, and a night (of his) to terminate after a<br>thousand Yugas are persons that know day and night.[216] On the advent of<br>(Brahman's) day everything that is manifest springeth from the<br>unmanifest; and when (his) night cometh, into that same which is called<br>unmanifest all things disappear. That same assemblage of creatures,<br>springing forth again and again, dissolveth on the advent of night, and<br>springeth forth (again), O son of Pritha, when day cometh, constrained<br>(by the force of action, etc.)[217]. There is, however, another entity,<br>unmanifest and eternal, which is beyond that unmanifest, and which is not<br>destroyed when all the entities are destroyed. It is said to be<br>unmanifest and indestructible. They call it the highest goal, attaining<br>which no one hath to come back. That is my Supreme seat. That Supreme<br>Being, O son of Pritha, He within whom are all entities, and by whom all<br>this is permeated, is to be attained by reverence undirected to any other<br>object. I will tell thee the times, O bull of Bharata's race, in which<br>devotees departing (from this life) go, never to return, or to return.<br>The fire, the Light, the day, the lighted fortnight, the six months of<br>the northern solstice, departing from here, the persons knowing Brahma go<br>through this path to Brahma.[218] Smoke, night, also the dark-fortnight<br>(and) the six months of the southern solstice, (departing) through this<br>path, devotee, attaining to the lunar light, returneth. The bright and<br>the dark, these two paths, are regarded to be the eternal (two paths) of<br>the universe. By the one, (one) goeth never to return; by the other, one<br>(going) cometh back. Knowing these two paths, O son of Pritha, no devotee<br>is deluded. Therefore, at all times, be endued with devotion, O Arjuna.<br>The meritorious fruit that is prescribed for the (study of the) Vedas,<br>for sacrifices, for ascetic austerities and for gifts, a devotee knowing<br>all this (that hath been said here), attaineth to it all, and (also)<br>attaineth the Supreme and Primeval seat.'
