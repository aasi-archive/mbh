                            Dhritarashtra said, 'Alas, what was the state of (my) warriors, O<br>Sanjaya, when they were deprived of the mighty and god-like Bhishma who<br>had become a Brahmacharin for the sake of his reverend sire? Even then I<br>regarded the Kurus and all the others as slain by the Pandavas when<br>Bhishma, despising the son of Drupada, struck him not. Wretch that I am,<br>also, I hear today of my sire's slaughter. What can be a heavier sorrow<br>than this? My heart assuredly, O Sanjaya, is made of adamant, since it<br>breaketh not into a hundred fragments on hearing of Bhishma's death! Tell<br>me, O thou of excellent vows, what was done by that lion among the Kurus,<br>viz., the victory-desiring Bhishma when he was slain in battle. I cannot<br>at all brook it that Devavrata should be slain in battle. Alas, he that<br>was not slain by Jamadagni's son himself in days of old by means of even<br>his celestial weapons, alas, he hath now been slain by Drupada's son<br>Sikhandin, the prince of Panchala!&#8212;<br><br>'Sanjaya said,&#8212;"Slain in the evening the Kuru grandsire Bhishma saddened<br>the Dhartarashtras and delighted the Panchalas. Falling down on the<br>earth, he lay on his bed of arrows without however, touching the earth<br>with his body. Indeed, when Bhishma, thrown down from his car fell upon<br>the surface of the earth, cries of Oh and Alas were heard among all<br>creatures. When that boundary-tree of the Kurus, viz., the ever<br>victorious Bhishma, fell down, fear entered the hearts, O king, of the<br>Kshatriyas of both the armies. Beholding Bhishma, the son of Santanu,<br>with his standard overthrown and his armour cut open, both the Kurus and<br>the Pandavas were inspired, O monarch, with sentiments of cheerlessness.<br>And the welkin was enveloped with a gloom and the Sun himself became dim.<br>The Earth seemed to utter loud shrieks when the son of Santanu was slain.<br>This one is the foremost of those conversant with the Vedas! This one is<br>the best of those that are conversant with the Vedas!&#8212;Even thus did<br>creatures speak of that bull among men as he lay (on his bed of<br>arrows).This one, formerly, ascertaining his sire Santanu to be afflicted<br>by Kama, this bull among men, resolved to draw up his vital steed!&#8212;Even<br>thus did the Rishis together with the Siddhas and the Charanas said of<br>that foremost one of the Bharatas as he lay on his bed of arrows. When<br>Santanu's son Bhishma, the grandsire of the Bharatas, was slain, thy<br>sons, O sire, knew not what to do. Their faces wore an expression of<br>grief. The splendour of their countenances seemed to abandon them, O<br>Bharata! All of them stood in shame, hanging down their heads. The<br>Pandavas, on the other hand, having, won the victory, stood at the head<br>of their ranks. And they all blew their large conchs decked with gold.<br>And when in consequence of their joys thousands of trumpets, O sinless<br>one, were blown there, we beheld O monarch, the mighty Bhimasena, the son<br>of Kunti, sporting in great glee, having quickly slain many hostile<br>warriors endued with great strength. And a great swoon overtook all the<br>Kurus. And Karna and Duryodhana repeatedly drew long breaths. When the<br>Kuru grandsire Bhishma fell down, thus, cries of sorrow were heard all<br>round, and the greatest confusion prevailed (among the Kuru army).<br>Beholding Bhishma fallen, thy son Dussasana, with great speed, entered<br>the division commanded by Drona. That hero, clad in mail and at the head<br>of his own troops, had been placed by his elder brother (for the<br>protection of Bhishma). That tiger among men now came, plunging the<br>troops he had commanded into grief. Beholding him coming towards them,<br>the Kauravas surrounded prince Dussasana, desirous, O monarch, of hearing<br>what he had to say. Then Dussasana of Kuru's race informed Drona of<br>Bhishma's slaughter. Drona then, hearing those evil tidings, suddenly<br>fell down from his car. Then the valiant son of Bharadwaja, quickly<br>recovering his senses, forbade the Kuru army, sire, to continue the<br>fight. Beholding the Kurus desist from battle, the Pandavas also, through<br>messengers on fleet horses, forbade their orders, ceased to fight, the<br>kings of both armies, putting off their armour, all repaired to Bhishma.<br>Desisting from the fight, thousands of (other) warriors then, proceeded<br>towards the high-souled Bhishma like the celestials towards the Lord of<br>all creatures. Approaching Bhishma who was then, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, lying (on his bed of arrows), the Pandavas and the Kurus stood<br>there, having offered him their salutations. Then Santanu's son Bhishma<br>of righteous soul addressed the Pandavas and the Kurus who having<br>reverenced him thus, stood before him. And he said,&#8212;Welcome to you, ye<br>highly blessed ones! Welcome to you, ye mighty car-warriors! Gratified am<br>I with your sight, ye that are the equals of the very gods.&#8212;Thus<br>addressing them with his head hanging down, he once more said,&#8212;'My head<br>is hanging down greatly. Let a pillow be given to me!&#8212;The kings<br>(standing there) then fetched many excellent pillows that were very soft<br>and made of very delicate fabrics. The grandsire, however, desired them<br>not. That tiger among men then said unto those kings with a<br>laugh,&#8212;These, ye kings, do not become a hero's bed.&#8212;Beholding them that<br>foremost of men, that mightiest of car-warriors in all the worlds, viz.,<br>the mighty-armed Dhananjaya the son of Pandu, he said,&#8212;O Dhananjaya, O<br>thou of mighty arms, my head hangeth down, O sire! Give me a pillow such<br>as thou regardest to be fit!&#8212;'"
