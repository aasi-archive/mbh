                            Dhritarashtra said, "Tell me, O Sanjaya, how that great bowman Drona and<br>the Panchala prince of Prishata's race encounter each other in battle,<br>each striving his best. I regard destiny to be superior, O Sanjaya, to<br>exertion, when Santanu's son Bhishma (even) could not escape Pandu's son<br>in battle. Indeed, Bhishma, when enraged in battle could destroy all<br>mobile and immobile creatures, why, O Sanjaya, could he not then by his<br>prowess, escape the son of Pandu in battle?"<br><br>Sanjaya said, 'Listen, O king, quietly to this terrific battle. The son<br>of Pandu is incapable of being vanquished by the very gods with Vasava.<br>Drona with diverse arrows pierced Dhrishtadyumna and felled the latter's<br>charioteer from his niche in the car.[362] And, O sire, the enraged hero<br>also afflicted Dhrishtadyumna's four steeds with four excellent shafts.<br>And the heroic Dhrishtadyumna too pierced Drona in the combat with nine<br>sharp arrows and addressed him, saying, 'Wait&#8212;Wait'. 'Then, again,<br>Bharadwaja's son of great prowess and immeasurable soul, covered with his<br>arrows the wrathful Dhrishtadyumna. And he took up a dreadful arrow for<br>the destruction of Prishata's son whose force resembled that of Sakra's<br>bolt and which was like a second rod of death. And beholding that arrow<br>aimed by Bharadwaja in battle, loud cries of oh and alas arose, O<br>Bharata, among all the combatants. And then we beheld the wonderful<br>prowess of Dhrishtadyumna insomuch that the hero stood alone, immovable<br>like a mountain. And he cut off that terrible and blazing arrow coming<br>towards him like his own Death, and also showered an arrowy downpour on<br>Bharadwaja's son. And beholding that difficult feat achieved by<br>Dhrishtadyumna, the Panchalas with the Pandavas, filled with delight, set<br>up loud shouts. And that prince, endued with great prowess, desirous of<br>slaying Drona hurled at him a dart of great impetuosity, decked with gold<br>and stones of lapis lazuli. Thereupon the son of Bharadwaja, smiling the<br>while, cut off into three fragments that dart decked with gold that was<br>coming towards him impetuously. Beholding his dart thus baffled,<br>Dhrishtadyumna of great prowess rained arrowy downpours on Drona, O king.<br>Then that mighty car-warrior Drona, baffling that arrowy shower, cut off<br>when the opportunity presented, the bow of Drupada's son. His bow (thus)<br>cut off in the combat, that mighty warrior of great fame hurled at Drona<br>a heavy mace endued with the strength of the mountain. And hurled from<br>his hands, that mace coursed through the air for Drona's destruction. And<br>then we beheld the wonderful prowess of Bharadwaja's son. By (the)<br>lightness (of his car's motion), he baffled that mace decked with gold,<br>and having baffled it, he shot at Prishata's son many shafts of sharp<br>edge, well-tempered, furnished with golden wings, and whetted on stone.<br>And these, penetrating through Prishata's coat of mail, drank his blood<br>in that battle. Then the high-souled Dhrishtadyumna, taking up another<br>bow, and putting forth his prowess pierced Drona in that encounter with<br>five shafts. And then those two bulls among men, both covered with blood,<br>looked beautiful like two blossoming Kinsukas in spring variegated with<br>flowers. Then, O king, excited with wrath and putting forth his prowess<br>at the head of his division, Drona once more cut off the bow of Drupada's<br>son. And then that hero of immeasurable soul covered that warrior whose<br>bow was cut off, with innumerable straight arrows like the clouds<br>showering rain on a mountain. And he also felled his foe's charioteer<br>from his niche in the car. And his four steeds, too, with four sharp<br>arrows, Drona felled in that combat that set up a leonine roar. And with<br>another shaft he cut off the leathern fence that cased Dhrishtadyumna's<br>hand. His bow cut off, deprived of car, his steeds slain, and charioteer<br>overthrown, the prince of Panchala alighted from his car, mace in hand,<br>displaying great prowess. But before he could come down from his car, O<br>Bharata, Drona with his shafts cut off that mace into fragments. This<br>feat seemed wonderful to us. And then the mighty prince of the Panchalas<br>of strong arms, taking a large and beautiful shield decked with a hundred<br>moons, and a large scimitar of beautiful make, rushed impetuously from<br>desire of slaying Drona, like a hungry lion in the forest towards an<br>infuriate elephant. Then wonderful was the prowess that we behold of<br>Bharadwaja's son, and his lightness (of hand) in the use of weapons, as<br>also the strength of his arms, O Bharata, in as much as, alone, he<br>checked Prishata's son with a shower of arrows. And although possessed of<br>great might in battle, he was unable to proceed further. And we behold<br>the mighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna staying where he did and warding<br>off those clouds of arrows with his shield, using his arms with great<br>dexterity. Then the mighty-armed Bhima endued with great strength quickly<br>came there, desirous of aiding in battle the high-souled son of Prishata.<br>And he pierced Drona, O king, with seven sharp-pointed arrows, and<br>speedily caused Prishata's son to be taken up on another car. Then king<br>Duryodhana urged the ruler of the Kalingas supported by a large division,<br>for the protection of Bharadwaja's son. Then that terrible and mighty<br>division of the Kalingas, O ruler of men, rushed against Bhima at the<br>command of thy son. And Drona then, that foremost of car-warriors,<br>abandoning the prince of Panchala, encountered Virata and Drupada<br>together. And Dhrishtadyumna also proceeded to support king Yudhishthira<br>in battle. And then commenced a fierce battle, making the hair stand on<br>end, between the Kalingas and the high-souled Bhima, a battle that was<br>destructive of the universe, terrific, and awful."
