                            Sanjaya said, "Abhimanyu, O king, displaying his prowess for the sake of<br>Bhishma, fought with thy son who was supported by a large force. Then<br>Duryodhana, excited with wrath, struck Abhimanyu in the chest with rune<br>straight arrows, and once more with three. Then in that battle, Arjuna's<br>son, inflamed with wrath, hurled at Duryodhana's car a terrible dart<br>resembling the rod of Death himself. Thy son, however, that mighty<br>car-warrior, O king, with a broad-headed arrow of great sharpness, cut<br>off in twain that dart of terrible force coursing towards him with great<br>speed. Beholding that dart of his drop down on the earth, Arjuna's<br>wrathful son pierced Duryodhana with three shafts in his arms and chest.<br>And once more, O Chief of the Bharatas, that mighty car-warrior of<br>Bharata's race struck the Kuru king with ten fierce shafts in the centre<br>of his chest. And the battle, O Bharata, that took place between those<br>two heroes, viz., Subhadra's son, and that bull of Kuru's race, the<br>former fighting for compassing Bhishma's death and the latter for<br>Arjuna's defeat, was fierce and interesting to behold, and gratifying to<br>the senses, and was applauded by all the kings. That bull among Brahmanas<br>and chastiser of foes, viz., the son of Drona, excited with wrath in that<br>battle, forcibly struck Satyaki in the chest with fierce arrow. The<br>grandson of Sini also, that hero of immeasurable soul, struck the<br>preceptor's son in every vital limbs with nine shafts winged with the<br>feathers of the Kanka bird. Aswatthaman then, in that battle, struck<br>Satyaki (in return) with nine shafts, and once more, quickly, with<br>thirty, in his arms and chest. Then that great bowman Of the Satwata<br>race, possessed of great fame, deeply pierced by Drona's son, pierced the<br>latter (in return) with arrows. The mighty car-warrior Paurava, covering<br>Dhrishtaketu in that battle with his shafts, mangled that great bowman<br>exceedingly. The mighty car-warrior Dhrishtaketu, endued with great<br>strength, quickly pierced the former with thirty arrows. Then the mighty<br>car-warrior Paurava cut off Dhrishtaketu's bow, and uttering a loud<br>shout, pierced him with whetted shafts. Dhrishtaketu then taking up<br>another bow, pierced Paurava, O king, with three and seventy shafts of<br>great sharpness. Those two great bowmen and mighty car-warriors, both of<br>gigantic stature, pierced each other with showers of arrows. Each<br>succeeded in cutting off the other's bow, and each slew the other's<br>steeds. And both of them, thus deprived of their cars, then encountered<br>each other in a battle with swords. And each took up a beautiful shield<br>made of bull's hide and docked with a hundred moons and graced with a<br>hundred stars. And each of them also took up a polished sword of<br>brilliant lustre. And thus equipt, they rushed, O king at each other,<br>like two lions in the deep forest, both seeking the companionship of the<br>same lioness in her season. They wheeled in beautiful circles, advanced<br>and retreated, and displayed other movements, seeking to strike each<br>other. Then Paurava, excited with wrath, addressed Dhrishtaketu,<br>saying&#8212;Wait, Wait,&#8212;and struck him on the frontal bone with that large<br>scimitar of his. The king of the Chedis also, in that battle, struck<br>Paurava, that bull among men, on his shoulder-joint, with his large<br>scimitar of sharp edge. Those two repressors of foes thus encountering<br>each other in dreadful battle and thus striking each other, O king, both<br>fell down on the field. Then thy son Jayatsena, taking Paurava up on his<br>car, removed him from the field of battle on that vehicle. And as regards<br>Dhrishtaketu, the valiant and heroic Sahadeva, the son of Madri,<br>possessed of great prowess, bore him away from the field.<br><br>"Chitrasena, having pierced Susarman with many arrows made wholly of<br>iron, once more pierced him with sixty arrows and once more with nine.<br>Susarman, however, excited with wrath in battle, pierced thy son, O king,<br>with hundreds of arrows. Chitrasena then, O monarch, excited with rage,<br>pierced his adversary with thirty straight shafts. Susarman, however,<br>pierced Chitrasena again in return.[480]<br><br>"In that battle for the destruction of Bhishma, Subhadra's son, enhancing<br>his fame and honour, fought with prince Vrihadvala, putting forth his<br>prowess for aiding (his sire) Partha and then proceeded towards Bhishma's<br>front. The ruler of the Kosalas, having pierced the son of Arjuna with<br>five shafts made of iron, once more pierced him with twenty straight<br>shafts. Then the son of Subhadra pierced the ruler of Kosalas with eight<br>shafts made wholly of iron. He succeeded not, however, in making the<br>ruler of the Kosalas to tremble, and, therefore, he once more pierced him<br>with many arrows. And Phalguni's son then cut off Vrihadvala's bow, and<br>struck him again with thirty arrows winged with feathers of the Kanka<br>bird. Prince Vrihadvala then, taking up another bow, angrily pierced the<br>son of Phalguni in that battle with many arrows. Verily, O scorcher of<br>foes, the battle, for Bhishma's sake, that took place between them, both<br>excited with rage and both conversant with every mode of fight, was like<br>the encounter of Vali and Vasava in days of old on the occasion of the<br>battle between the gods and the Asuras.<br><br>"Bhimasena, fighting against the elephant-division, looked highly<br>resplendent like Sakra armed with the thunder after splitting large<br>mountains.[481] Indeed, elephants, huge as hills, slaughtered by<br>Bhimasena in battle, fell down in numbers on the field, filling the earth<br>with their shrieks. Resembling massive heaps of antimony, and of<br>mountain-like proportions, those elephants with frontal globes split<br>open, lying prostrate on the earth, seemed like mountains strewn over the<br>earth's surface. The mighty bowman Yudhishthira, protected by a large<br>force, afflicted the ruler of the Madras, encountering him in that<br>dreadful battle. The ruler of the Madras, in return, displaying his<br>prowess for the sake of Bhishma, afflicted the son of Dharma, that mighty<br>car-warrior, in battle. The king of Sindhus, having pierced Virata with<br>nine straight arrows of keen points, once more struck him with thirty.<br>Virata, however, O king, that commander of a large division, struck<br>Jayadratha in the centre of his chest with thirty shafts of keen points.<br>The ruler of the Matsyas and the ruler of the Sindhus, both armed with<br>beautiful bows and beautiful scimitars, both decked with handsome coats<br>of mail and weapons and standards, and both of beautiful forms looked<br>resplendent in that battle.<br><br>"Drona, encountering Dhrishtadyumna the prince of the Panchalas in<br>dreadful battle, fought fiercely with his straight shafts. Then Drona, O<br>king, having cut off the large bow of Prishata's son, pierced him deeply<br>with fifty arrows. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son of<br>Prishata, taking up another bow, sped at Drona who was contending with<br>him, many arrows. The mighty car-warrior Drona however, cut off all those<br>arrows, striking them with his own. And then Drona sped at Drupada's son<br>five fierce shafts. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son of<br>Prishata, excited with rage, hurled at Drona in that battle a mace<br>resembling the rod of Death himself. Drona however, with fifty arrows<br>checked that mace decked with gold as it coursed impetuously towards him.<br>Thereupon that mace, cut into fragments, O king, by those shafts shot<br>from Drona's bow, fell down on the earth. Then that scorcher of foes,<br>viz., the son of Prishata, beholding his mace baffled, hurled at Drona an<br>excellent dart made wholly of iron. Drona, however, O Bharata, cut that<br>dart with nine shafts in that battle and then afflicted that great<br>bowman, viz., the son of Prishata. Thus took place, O king, that fierce<br>and awful battle between Drona and the son of Prishata, for the sake of<br>Bhishma.<br><br>"Arjuna, getting at the son of Ganga, afflicted him with many arrows of<br>keen points, and rushed at him like an infuriate elephant in the forest<br>upon another. King Bhagadatta, however, of great prowess then rushed at<br>Arjuna, and checked his course in battle with showers of arrows. Arjuna<br>then, in that dreadful battle, pierced Bhagadatta's elephant coming<br>towards him, with many polished arrows of iron, that were all bright as<br>silver and furnished with keen points. The son of Kunti, meanwhile, O<br>king, urged Sikhandin, saying,&#8212;Proceed, proceed, towards Bhishma, and<br>slay him!&#8212;Then, O elder brother of Pandu, the ruler of Pragjyotishas,<br>abandoning that son of Pandu, quickly proceeded, O king, against the car<br>of Drupada. Then Arjuna, O monarch, speedily proceeded towards Bhishma,<br>placing Sikhandin ahead. And then there took place a fierce battle, for<br>all the brave combatants of thy army rushed with great vigour against<br>Arjuna, uttering loud shouts. And all this seemed extremely wonderful.<br>Like the wind dispersing in the summer masses of clouds in the welkin,<br>Arjuna dispersed, O king, all those diverse divisions of thy sons.<br>Sikhandin, however, without any anxiety, coming up at the grandsire of<br>the Bharatas, quickly pierced him with great many arrows. As regards<br>Bhishma, his car was then his fire-chamber. His bow was the flame of that<br>fire. And swords I and darts and maces constituted the fuel of that fire.<br>And the showers of arrows he shot were the blazing sparks of that fire<br>with which he was then consuming Kshatriyas in that battle. As a raging<br>conflagration with constant supply of fuel, wandereth amid masses of dry<br>grass when aided by the wind, so did Bhishma blaze up with his flames,<br>scattering his celestial weapons. And the Kuru hero slew the Somakas that<br>followed Partha in that battle. Indeed that mighty car-warrior checked<br>also the other forces of Arjuna, by means of his straight and whetted<br>shafts furnished with wings of gold. Filling in that dreadful battle all<br>the points of the compass, cardinal and subsidiary, with his leonine<br>shouts, Bhishma felled many car-warriors, O king, (from their cars) and<br>many steeds along with their riders. And he caused large bodies of cars<br>to look like forests of palmyras shorn of their leafy heads. That<br>foremost of all wielders of weapons, in that battle, deprived cars and<br>steeds and elephants, of their riders. Hearing the twang of his bow and<br>the slap of his palms, both resembling the roll of the thunder, the<br>troops, O king, trembled all over the field. The shafts, O chief of men,<br>of thy sire were never bootless as they fell. Indeed, shot from Bhishma's<br>bow they never fell only touching the bodies of the foe (but pierced them<br>through in every case). We saw crowds of cars, O king, deprived of<br>riders, but unto which were yoked fleet steeds, dragged on all sides with<br>the speed of the wind. Full fourteen thousand great car-warriors of noble<br>parentage, prepared to lay down their lives, unretreating and brave, and<br>possessed of standards decked with gold, belonging to the Chedis, the<br>Kasis, and the Karushas, approaching Bhishma, that hero who resembled the<br>Destroyer himself with wide-open mouth, were despatched to the other<br>world, with their steeds, cars and elephants. There was not, O king, a<br>single great car-warrior among the Somakas, who, having approached<br>Bhishma in that battle, returned with life from that engagement.<br>Beholding Bhishma's prowess, people regarded all those warriors (who<br>approached him) as already despatched to the abode of the king of the<br>Dead. Indeed, no car-warrior ventured to approach Bhishma in battle,<br>except the heroic Arjuna having white steeds (yoked unto his car) and<br>owning Krishna for his charioteer, and Sikhandin, the prince of Panchala,<br>of immeasurable energy."
