                            Sanjaya said, "Then when the sun assumed a red hue, king Duryodhana,<br>desirous of battle, rushed towards Bhima from desire of slaying him.<br>Beholding that heroic warrior cherishing deep animosity (thus) coming<br>towards him, Bhimasena, excited with great wrath, said these<br>words,&#8212;'That hour hath come which I have desired for so many years. I<br>will slay thee to-day if thou dost not abandon the battle. Slaying thee I<br>shall today dispel the sorrows of Kunti as also of Draupadi and the woes<br>that were ours during our exile in the woods. Filled with pride, thou<br>hadst formerly humiliated the sons of Pandu. Behold, O son of Gandhari,<br>the dire fruit of that sinful behaviour. Following the counsels of Karna<br>as also of Suvala's son, and recking the Pandavas little, thou hadst<br>formerly behaved towards them as thou hadst hinted. Thou hadst also<br>disregarded Krishna who begged thee (for peace). With a joyous heart<br>didst thou despatch Uluka (to us) with thy messages. For all these, I<br>shall slay thee to-day with all thy kinsmen, and thus avenge all those<br>offences of thine of former days.' Having said these words, Bhima bending<br>his bow and stretching it repeatedly, and taking up a number of terrible<br>shafts whose effulgence resembled that of the lightning itself, and<br>filled with wrath, quickly sped six and thirty of them at Duryodhana. And<br>those shafts resembled the flames of a blazing fire, and coursed straight<br>with the force of the thunder-bolt. And then he pierced Duryodhana's bow<br>with two shafts, and his charioteer with two. And with four shafts he<br>despatched Duryodhana's (four) steeds to the regions of Yama. And that<br>grinder of foes then, with two shafts shot with great force, cut off in<br>that battle the king's umbrella from his excellent car. And with three<br>other shafts he cut off his handsome and blazing standard. And having cut<br>it off, he uttered a loud shout in the very sight of thy son. And that<br>beautiful standard of the latter, decked with diverse gems, suddenly fell<br>down on the earth from his car like a flash of lightning from the clouds.<br>And all the kings beheld that beautiful standard of the Kuru king,<br>bearing the device of an elephant, decked with gems, and blazing like the<br>sun, fell down cut off (by Bhimasena). And that mighty car-warrior, viz.,<br>Bhima, then pierced Duryodhana in that battle, smiling the while, with<br>ten shafts like a guide piercing a mighty elephant with the hook. Then<br>that foremost of car-warriors, viz., the mighty king of the Sindhus,<br>supported by many brave warriors, placed himself on the flank of<br>Duryodhana. And then that great car-warrior, viz., Kripa, O king, caused<br>the vindictive Duryodhana, that son of Kuru's race, of immeasurable<br>energy, to mount on his own car. Then king Duryodhana, deeply pierced by<br>Bhimasena and feeling great pain, sat down on the terrace of that car.<br>Then Jayadratha, desirous of slaying Bhima, surrounded him on all sides<br>with several thousands of cars. Then, O king, Dhrishtaketu and Abhimanyu<br>of great energy, and the Kekayas, and the sons of Draupadi, all<br>encountered thy sons. And the high-souled Abhimanyu smote them all,<br>piercing each with five straight shafts, resembling the bolts of heaven<br>or Death's selves, shot from his excellent bow. Thereupon, all of them,<br>unable to bear it (coolly), showered on that foremost of car-warriors,<br>viz., the son of Subhadra, a perfect down-pour of sharp shafts like<br>rain-charged clouds pouring rain on the breast of the mountains of Meru.<br>But Abhimanyu, that invisible warrior accomplished in arms, thus<br>afflicted by them in battle, caused all thy sons, O king, to tremble like<br>the wielder of the thunder-bolt causing the mighty Asuras to tremble in<br>the battle between the celestials and the latter. Then that foremost of<br>car-warriors, O Bharata, shot fourteen broad-headed shafts, fierce and<br>looking like snakes of virulent poison, at Vikarna. Endued with great<br>prowess and as if dancing in that battle, he felled with those shafts the<br>standard of Vikarna from his car and slew also his charioteer and steeds.<br>Then that mighty car-warrior, the son of Subhadra, again sped at Vikarna<br>many other arrows that were well-tempered, straight-going, and capable of<br>penetrating every armour. And those arrows furnished with feathers of the<br>kanka bird, coming at Vikarna and passing through his body, entered the<br>earth, like hissing snakes. And those arrows, with wings and points<br>decked with gold, bathed in Vikarna's blood, seemed to vomit blood on the<br>earth. Beholding Vikarna thus pierced, his other uterine brothers rushed,<br>in that battle, against those car-warriors headed by Subhadra's son. And<br>when these invincible warriors upon their (own) cars came upon those<br>combatants (of the Pandava army) resplendent like so many suns and<br>staying on their cars both began to pierce one another.. And Durmukha,<br>having pierced Srutakarman with five shafts, cut off the latter's<br>standard with a single shaft and then pierced his charioteer with seven.<br>And advancing closer, he slew with half a dozen shafts his foe's steeds,<br>fleet as the wind and cased in golden armour, and then felled his<br>charioteer. Srutakarman, however, staying on that car of his, the steeds<br>of which had been slain, hurled in great wrath a dart blazing like a<br>fierce meteor. That dart, blazing with effulgence, passing through the<br>renowned Durmukha's hard coat of mail, penetrated into the earth.<br>Meanwhile the mighty Sutasoma beholding Srutakarman deprived of his car,<br>caused him to mount upon his own car in the very sight of all the troops.<br>The heroic Srutakirti rushed against thy son Jayatsena in that battle,<br>desirous, O king, of slaying that renowned warrior. Then thy son<br>Jayatsena, O king, with a sharp arrow having a horse-shoe head, smiling<br>the while, cut off the bow of the high-souled Srutakirti as the latter<br>came along stretching it in his hands. Then Satanika, beholding his<br>uterine brother's bow cut off, endued as he was with great valour,<br>quickly came at that spot repeatedly roaring like a lion. And Satanika,<br>drawing his bow in that battle with great force, speedily pierced<br>Jayatsena with ten shafts, and uttered a loud shout like an infuriate<br>elephant. And with another arrow of sharp point and capable of<br>penetrating every armour, Satanika deeply pierced Jayatsena in the chest.<br>Just at that time, Dushkarna who was near his brother. (Jayatsena)<br>infuriate with anger, cut off Satanika's bow and arrow. Then the mighty<br>Satanika taking up another excellent bow capable of bearing a great<br>strain, aimed many sharp shafts. And addressing Dushkarna in the presence<br>of his brother (Jayatsena), saying&#8212;'Wait', 'Wait',&#8212;he sped at him those<br>sharp and blazing shafts resembling so many snakes. And then he speedily<br>cut off Dushkarna's bow with one arrow, and slew his charioteer, O sire,<br>with two, and then pierced Dushkarna himself with seven arrows. And that<br>spotless warrior then with a dozen sharp shafts slew all the steeds of<br>Dushkarna that were fleet as the mind and of variegated hue. And then<br>with another broad-headed arrow, well-aimed and capable of coursing<br>swiftly, Satanika, excited with great wrath deeply pierced Dushkarna in<br>the chest. And thereupon the latter fell down on the earth like a tree<br>struck with lightning. Beholding Dushkarna slain, five mighty<br>car-warriors, O king, surrounded Satanika on all sides, from desire of<br>slaying him. And they struck the renowned Satanika with showers of<br>arrows. Then the five Kekaya brothers, excited with wrath, approached<br>(Satanika for rescuing him). Beholding the latter coming upon them, thy<br>sons&#8212;those mighty car-warriors,&#8212;rushed towards them like elephants<br>rushing against mighty elephants. (These amongst thy sons, viz.,)<br>Durmukha and Durjaya and the youthful Durmarshana and Satranjaya and<br>Satrusha, all renowned warriors, excited with rage, proceeded, O king,<br>against the (five) Kekaya brothers. On their cars that resembled<br>(fortified) towns, unto which were yoked steeds decked with ornaments,<br>and which were graced with beautiful standards of variegated hue, those<br>heroes wielding excellent bows and cased in beautiful coats of mail and<br>owning excellent standards, entered the hostile army like lions entering<br>one forest from another. Smiting one another, fierce and terrific was the<br>battle that ensued between them and the foe, in which cars and elephants<br>got entangled with one another. Cherishing feelings of hostility towards<br>one another, the terrible battle in which they took part lasted for a<br>short space of time about sunset, increasing the population of Yama's<br>kingdom. And car-warriors and horsemen by thousands were strewn over the<br>field. And Bhishma the son of Santanu excited with wrath, began to<br>slaughter the troops of the high-souled Pandavas with his straight<br>shafts. And with his arrows he began to despatch the combatants of the<br>Panchalas to the domains of Yama. And the grandsire, having thus broken<br>the ranks of the Pandavas at last withdrew his troops and retired, O<br>king, to his encampment. And king Yudhishthira also, beholding both<br>Dhrishtadyumna and Vrikodara, smelt their heads, and filled with joy,<br>retired to his tents."
