                            "Dhritarashtra said.&#8212;-"Thou art intelligent, O Sanjaya, and acquainted<br>with the truth (about everything). Thou hast duly given a description of<br>the island in brief. Tell us now of the island in detail. Tell us now of<br>the dimension of the expanse of land that lies in the portion looking<br>like a hare. Thou mayst then speak of the portion resembling peepul tree."<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Thus addressed by the king, Sanjaya began to say.<br><br>"Sanjaya said,&#8212;'Stretching from east to west, are these six mountains<br>that are equal[36] and that extend from the eastern to the western ocean.<br>They are Himavat, Hemakuta, that best of mountains called Nishadha, Nila<br>abounding with stones of lapis lazuli, Sweta white as the moon, and the<br>mountains called Sringavat composed of all kinds of metals.[37] These are<br>the six mountains, O king, which are always the resorts of Siddhas and<br>Charanas. The space lying between each of these measures a thousand<br>Yojanas, and thereon are many delightful kingdoms. And these divisions<br>are called Varshas, O Bharata. In all those kingdoms reside creatures of<br>diverse species. This (the land where we are) is in the Varsha that is<br>called after Bharata. Next to it (northwards) is the Varsha called after<br>Himavat. The land that is beyond Hemakuta is called Harivarsha, South of<br>the Nila range and on the north of the Nishadha is a mountain, O king,<br>called Malyavat that stretches from east to west. Beyond Malyavat<br>northwards is the mountain called Gandhamadana.[38] Between these two<br>(viz., Malyavat and Gandhamadana) is a globular mountain called Meru made<br>of gold. Effulgent as the morning sun, it is like fire without smoke.[39]<br>It is eighty-four thousand Yojanas high, and, O king, its depth also is<br>eighty-four Yojanas. It standeth bearing the worlds above, below and<br>transversely. Besides Meru are situated, O lord, these four islands,<br>viz., Bhadraswa, and Ketumala, and Jamvudwipa otherwise called Bharata,<br>and Uttar-Kuru which is the abode of persons who have achieved the merit<br>of righteousness. The bird Sumukha, the son of Suparna, beholding that<br>all the birds on Meru were of golden plumage, reflected that he should<br>leave that mountain inasmuch as there was no difference between the good,<br>middling, and bad birds. The foremost of luminaries, the sun, always<br>circumambulates Meru, as also the moon with (his) attendant<br>constellation, and the Wind-god too. The mountain, O king, is endued with<br>celestial fruits and flowers, and it is covered all over with mansions<br>made of furnished gold. There, on that mountain, O king, the celestials,<br>the Gandharvas, the Asuras, and the Rakshasas, accompanied by the tribes<br>of Apsaras, always sport. There Brahman, and Rudra, and also Sakra the<br>chief of the celestials, assembled together, performed diverse kinds of<br>sacrifices with plentiful gifts. Tumvuru, and Narada and Viswavasu, and<br>the Hahas and the Huhus, repairing thither, adored the foremost of the<br>celestials with diverse hymns. The high-souled seven Rishis, and Kasyapa<br>the lord of creatures, repair thither, blessed be thou, on every parva<br>day.[40] Upon the summit of that mountain, Usanas, otherwise called the<br>Poet, sporteth with the Daityas (his disciples).[41] The jewels and gems<br>(that we see) and all the mountains abounding in precious stones are of<br>Meru. Therefrom a fourth part is enjoyed by the holy Kuvera. Only a<br>sixteenth part of that wealth he giveth unto men. On the northern side of<br>Meru is a delightful and excellent forest of Karnikaras, covered with the<br>flowers of every season,[42] and occupying a range of hills. There the<br>illustrious Pasupati himself, the creator of all things, surrounded by<br>his celestial attendants and accompanied by Uma, sporteth bearing a chain<br>of Karnikara flowers (on his neck) reaching down to his feet, and blazing<br>with radiance with his three eyes resembling three risen suns. Him<br>Siddhas truthful in speech, of excellent vows and austere ascetic<br>penances, can behold. Indeed, Maheswara is incapable of being seen by<br>persons of wicked conduct. From the summit of that mountain, like a<br>stream of milk, O ruler of men, the sacred and auspicious Ganga,<br>otherwise called Bhagirathi, adored by the most righteous, of universal<br>form and immeasurable and issuing out with terrific noise, falleth with<br>impetuous force on the delightful lake of Chandramas.[43] Indeed that<br>sacred lake, like an ocean, hath been formed by Ganga herself. (While<br>leaping from the mountains), Ganga, incapable of being supported by even<br>the mountains, was held for a hundred thousand years by the bearer of<br>Pinaka  on his head.[44] On the western side of Meru, O king, is<br>Ketumala.[45] And there also is Jamvukhanda. Both are great seats of<br>humanity, O king.[46] There, O Bharata, the measure of human life is ten<br>thousand years. The men are all of a golden complexion, and the women are<br>like Apsaras. And all the residents are without sickness, without sorrow,<br>and always cheerful. The men born there are of the effulgence of melted<br>gold. On the summits of Gandhamadana, Kuvera the lord of the Guhyakas,<br>with many Rakshasas and accompanied by tribes of Apsaras, passeth his<br>time in joy. Besides Gandhamadana there are many smaller mountains and<br>hills. The measure of human life there is eleven thousand years. There, O<br>king, the men are cheerful, and endued with great energy and great<br>strength and the women are all of the complexion of the lotus and highly<br>beautiful. Beyond Nila is (the Varsha called) Sweta, beyond Sweta is (the<br>Varsha called) Hiranyaka. Beyond Hiranyaka is (the Varsha called)<br>Airavata covered with provinces. The last Varsha in the (extreme) north<br>and Bharata's Varsha in the (extreme) south are both, O king, of the form<br>of a bow. These five Varshas (viz., Sweta, Hiranyaka, Elavrita,<br>Harivarsha, and Haimavat-varsha) are in the middle, of which Elavrita<br>exists in the very middle of all. Amongst these seven Varshas (the five<br>already mentioned and Airavata and Bharata) that which is further north<br>excels the one to its immediate south in respect of these attributes,<br>viz., the period of life, stature, health, righteousness, pleasure, and<br>profit. In these Varshas, O Bharata, creatures (though of diverse<br>species) yet, live together. Thus, O king, is Earth covered with<br>mountains. The huge mountains of Hemakuta are otherwise called Kailasa.<br>There, O king, Vaisravana passeth his time in joy with his Guhyakas.<br>Immediately to the north of Kailasa and near the mountains of Mainaka<br>there is a huge and beautiful mountain called Manimaya endued with golden<br>summits. Beside this mountain is a large, beautiful, crystal and<br>delightful lake called Vindusaras with golden sands (on its beach). There<br>king Bhagiratha, beholding Ganga (since) called after his own name,<br>resided for many years. There may be seen innumerable sacrificial stakes<br>made of gems, and Chaitya tree made of gold. It was there that he of a<br>thousand eyes and great fame won (ascetic) success by performing<br>sacrifices. There the Lord of all creatures, the eternal Creator of all<br>the worlds, endued with supreme energy surrounded by his ghostly<br>attendants, is adored. There Nara and Narayana, Brahman, and Manu, and<br>Sthanu as the fifth, are (ever present). And there the celestial stream<br>Ganga having three currents,[47] issuing out of the region of Brahman,<br>first showed herself, and then dividing herself into seven streams,<br>became Vaswokasara, Nalini, the sin-cleansing Saraswati, Jamvunadi, Sita,<br>Ganga and Sindhu as the seventh. The Supreme Lord hath (himself) made the<br>arrangement with reference to that inconceivable and celestial stream. It<br>is there that[48] sacrifices have been performed (by gods and Rishis) on<br>a thousand occasions after the end of the Yuga (when creation begins). As<br>regards the Saraswati, in some parts (of her course) she becometh visible<br>and in some parts not so. This celestial sevenfold Ganga is widely known<br>over the three worlds. Rakshasas reside on Himavat, Guhyakas on Hemakuta,<br>and serpents and Nagas on Nishadha, and ascetics on Gokarna. The Sweta<br>mountains are said to be the abode of the celestial and the Asuras. The<br>Gandharvas always reside on Nishadhas, and the regenerate Rishis on Nila.<br>The mountains of Sringavat also are regarded as the resort of the<br>celestials.<br><br>"'These then, O great king, are the seven Varshas of the world as they<br>are divided. Diverse creatures, mobile[49] and immobile, are placed in<br>them all. Diverse kinds of prosperity, both providential and human, are<br>noticeable in them. They are incapable of being counted. Those desirous,<br>however, of their own good believe (all this), I have now told thee of<br>that delightful region (of land) of the form of a hare about which thou<br>hadst asked me. At the extremities of that region are the two Varshas,<br>viz., one on the north and the other on the south. Those two also have<br>now been told to thee. Then again the two islands Naga-dwipa and<br>Kasyapa-dwipa are the two ears of this region of the form of a hare. The<br>beautiful mountains of Maleya, O king, having rocks like plates of<br>copper, form another (prominent) part of Jamvudwipa that having its shape<br>resembling a hare.'"
