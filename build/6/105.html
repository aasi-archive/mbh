                            Sanjaya said, "O tiger among men, Arjuna sent those Kshatriyas that<br>followed Susarman to the abode of the King of the Dead by means of his<br>whetted shafts. Susarman however, in that battle, pierced Partha with his<br>shafts. And he pierced Vasudeva with seventy, and Arjuna once more with<br>nine shafts. Checking those shafts by means of his arrowy showers, that<br>mighty car-warrior, viz., the son of Indra, despatched Susarman's troops<br>unto Yama's abode. Those mighty car-warriors, while being slaughtered by<br>Partha in that battle as if by Death himself at the end of the Yuga, all<br>fled away from the field, O king struck with panic, Some abandoning their<br>steeds, some abandoning, O sire, their cars, and others their elephants,<br>fled away in all directions. Others taking with them their horses,<br>elephants, and cars, fled away, O king, with great speed. Foot-soldiers<br>in that dreadful battle, throwing aside their weapons, and without any<br>regard for one another, fled away hither and thither. Though forbidden by<br>Susarman the ruler of the Trigartas, and by other foremost of kings, they<br>stayed not yet in battle. Beholding that host routed, thy son Duryodhana<br>himself at the head of the whole army and with Bhishma ahead, attacked<br>Dhananjaya with all his vigour, for the sake, O king, of (protecting) the<br>life of the ruler of the Trigartas. And he stayed in battle, scattering<br>diverse kinds of arrows, supported by all his brothers. The rest of the<br>men all fled away. Similarly, the Pandavas, O king, clad in mail and with<br>all their vigour, proceeded, for the sake of Phalguni, to the spot where<br>Bhishma was. Although acquainted with the awful prowess, in battle of the<br>wielder of Gandiva, these yet proceeded with loud cries and great bravery<br>to the spot where Bhishma was and surrounded him on all sides. Then the<br>palmyra-bannered hero covered the Pandava army, in that battle, with his<br>straight shafts. The sun having reached the meridian, the Kauravas, O<br>king, fought with the Pandavas in one confused mass. The heroic Satyaki,<br>having pierced Kritavarman with five arrows, stayed in battle scattering<br>his arrows by thousands. And so king Drupada also, having pierced Drona<br>with many whetted shafts, once more pierced him with seventy shafts and<br>his charioteer with nine. Bhimasena also, having pierced his great<br>grandsire king Valhika uttered a loud roar like a tiger in the forest.<br>Arjuna's son (Abhimanyu) pierced by Chitrasena with many shafts, deeply<br>pierced Chitrasena in the chest with three arrows. Engaged with each<br>other in battle, those two foremost of men looked resplendent on the<br>field like the planets, Venus and Saturn, O king, in the firmament. Then<br>that slayer of foes, viz., the son of Subhadra, having slain his<br>antagonist's steeds and charioteer with nine arrows, uttered a loud<br>shout. Thereupon that mighty car-warrior, (viz., Chitrasena), quickly<br>jumping down from that car whose steed had been slain, mounted, O king,<br>without delay, the car of Durmukha. The valiant Drona, pierced the<br>latter's charioteer also, Then, O king, Drupada, thus afflicted at the<br>head of his troops, retreated by the aid of his fleet steeds,<br>recollecting the hostility that existed from days of old (between himself<br>and Drona). Bhimasena, within a moment, deprived king Valhika of his<br>steeds, car and charioteer, in the very sight of all the troops. Fallen<br>into a situation of great danger and with fear in his heart, O king,<br>Valhika, that best of men, jumping down from that vehicle, quickly<br>mounted upon the car of Lakshmana in that battle. Satyaki, having checked<br>Kritavarman in that dreadful battle, fell upon the grandsire and rained<br>on him shafts of diverse kinds.[470] Piercing the grandsire with sixty<br>whetted shafts winged with feathers, he seemed to dance on his car,<br>shaking his large bow. The grandsire then hurled at him a mighty dart<br>made of iron, decked with gold, endued with great velocity, and beautiful<br>as a daughter of the Nagas. Beholding that irresistible dart, resembling<br>Death himself, coursing towards him, that illustrious warrior of the<br>Vrishni race baffled it by the celerity of movements. Thereupon that<br>fierce dart, unable to reach him of the Vrishni race, fell down on the<br>earth like a large meteor of blazing splendour. Then he of Vrishni's<br>race, O king, taking up with a firm hand his own dart of golden<br>effulgence, hurled it at the car of the grandsire. That dart, hurled in<br>that dreadful battle with the strength of Satyaki's arms, coursed<br>impetuously like the fatal night, coursing speedily towards a (doomed)<br>man. As it coursed, however, towards him with great force, Bhishma cut it<br>in twain, O Bharata, with a couple of horse-shoe-headed arrows of keen<br>edge, and thereupon it fell down on the earth. Having cut that dart, that<br>grinder of foes, viz., Ganga's son, excited with wrath and smiling the<br>while struck Satyaki in the chest with nine arrows. Then the Pandava<br>warriors, O elder brother of Pandu, with their cars, elephants, and<br>steeds,[471] surrounded Bhishma in that battle, for the sake of rescuing<br>him of Madhu's race. Then commenced again a fierce battle, making the<br>hair to stand on end, between the Pandavas and the Kurus both of whom<br>were desirous of victory."
