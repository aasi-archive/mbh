                            Dhritarashtra said, "When the generalissimo Sweta, O son, was slain in<br>battle by the enemy, what did those mighty bowmen, the Panchalas with the<br>Pandavas, do? Hearing their commander Sweta slain, what happened between<br>those that strove for his sake and their foes that retreated before them?<br>O Sanjaya, hearing of our victory, (thy) words please my heart? Nor doth<br>my heart feel any shame in remembering our transgression.[348] The old<br>chief of Kuru's race is ever cheerful and devoted (to us). (As regards<br>Duryodhana), having provoked hostilities with that intelligent son of his<br>uncle, he sought at one time the protection of the sons of Pandu in<br>consequence of his anxiety and fear due to Yudhishthira. At that time,<br>abandoning everything he lived in misery. In consequence of the prowess<br>of the sons of Pandu, and everywhere receiving checks&#8212;having placed<br>himself amid entanglements&#8212;from his enemies Duryodhana had (for some<br>time) recourse to honourable behaviour. Formerly that wicked-minded king<br>had placed himself under their protection. Why, therefore, O Sanjaya,<br>hath Sweta who was devoted to Yudhishthira, been slain. Indeed, this<br>narrow-minded prince, with all his prospects, hath been hurled to the<br>nether regions by a number of wretches. Bhishma liked not the war, nor<br>even did the preceptor.[349] Nor Kripa, nor Gandhari liked it. O Sanjaya,<br>nor do I like it, nor Vasudeva of Vrishni's race, nor that just king the<br>son of Pandu; nor Bhima, nor Arjuna, nor those bulls among men, the twins<br>(liked it.) Always forbidden by me, by Gandhari, by Vidura, by Rama the<br>son of Jamadagni, and by the high-souled Vyasa also, the wicked-minded<br>and sinful Duryodhana, with Dussasana, O Sanjaya, always following the<br>counsels of Karna and Suvala's son, behaved maliciously towards the<br>Pandavas. I think, O Sanjaya, that he has fallen into great distress.<br>After the slaughter of Sweta and the victory of Bhishma what did Partha,<br>excited with rage, do in battle accompanied by Krishna? Indeed, it is<br>from Arjuna that my fears arise, and those fears, O Sanjaya, cannot be<br>dispelled. He, Dhananjaya. the son of Kunti, is brave and endued with<br>great activity. I think, with his arrows he will cut into fragments the<br>bodies of his enemies. The son of Indra, and in battle equal unto Upendra<br>the younger brother of Indra, a warrior whose wrath and purposes are<br>never futile, alas, beholding him what becomes the state of your minds?<br>Brave, acquainted with Vedas, resembling the fire and the Sun in<br>splendour, and possessing a knowledge of the Aindra weapon, that warrior<br>of immeasurable soul is ever victorious when he falleth upon the foe? His<br>weapons always falling upon the foe with the force of the thunderbolt and<br>his arms wonderfully quick in drawing the bowstring, the son of Kunti is<br>a mighty car-warrior. The formidable son of Drupada also, O Sanjaya, is<br>endued with great wisdom. What, indeed, did Dhristadyumna do when Sweta<br>was slain in battle? I think that in consequence of the wrongs they<br>sustained of old, and of the slaughter of their commander, the hearts of<br>the high-souled Pandavas blazed up. Thinking of their wrath I am never at<br>my ease, by day or by night, on account of Duryodhana. How did the great<br>battle take place? Tell me all about it, O Sanjaya.<br><br>Sanjaya said, "Hear, O king, quietly about thy transgressions. It<br>behoveth thee not to impute the fruit to Duryodhana. As is the<br>construction of an embankment when the waters have disappeared, so is thy<br>understanding, or, it is like the digging of a well when house is on<br>fire.[350] When, after the forenoon had passed away, the commander Sweta<br>was, O Bharata, slain by Bhishma in that fierce conflict, Virata's son<br>Sankha, that grinder of hostile ranks ever delighting in battle,<br>beholding Salya stationed with Kritavarman (on his car), suddenly blazed<br>up with wrath, like fire with clarified butter. That mighty warrior,<br>stretching his large bow that resembled the bow of Indra himself, rushed<br>with the desire of slaying the ruler of the Madras in battle, himself<br>supported on all sides by a large division of cars. And Sankha, causing<br>an arrowy downpour rushed towards the car on which Salya was. And<br>beholding him advancing like an infuriate elephant, seven mighty<br>car-warriors of thy side surrounded him&#8212;desirous of rescuing the ruler<br>of the Madras already within the jaws of death. Then the mighty-armed<br>Bhishma, roaring like the very clouds, and taking up a bow full six<br>cubits long, rushed towards Sankha in battle. And beholding that mighty<br>car-warrior and great bowman thus rushing, the Pandava host began to<br>tremble like a boat tossed by a violence of the tempest. Then Arjuna,<br>quickly advancing, placed himself in front of Sankha, thinking that<br>Sankha should, then be protected from Bhishma. And then the combat<br>commenced between Bhishma and Arjuna. And loud cries of oh and alas arose<br>among the warriors engaged in battle. And one force seemed to merge into<br>another force. And thus all were filled with wonder.[351] Then Salya,<br>mace in hand, alighting from his large car, slew, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, the four steeds of Sankha. Jumping down from his car thus deprived<br>of steeds, and taking a sword, Sankha ran towards Vibhatsu's car and<br>(mounting on it) was once more at his ease. And then there fell from<br>Bhishma's car innumerable arrows by which were covered the entire welkin<br>and the earth. And that foremost of smiters, Bhishma, slaughtered with<br>his arrows the Panchala, the Matsya, the Kekaya, and the Prabhadraka<br>host. And soon abandoning in that battle, Pandu's son (Arjuna) capable of<br>drawing the bow with even his left hand, Bhishma rushed towards Drupada,<br>the king of the Panchalas, surrounded by his host. And he soon covered<br>his dear relative with innumerable arrows. Like a forest consumed by fire<br>at the end of winter, the troops of Drupada were seen to be consumed. And<br>Bhishma stood in that battle like a blazing fire without smoke, or like<br>the Sun himself at midday scorching everything around with his heat. The<br>combatants of the Pandavas were not able to even look at Bhishma. And<br>afflicted with fear, the Pandava host cast its eyes around, and not<br>beholding any protector, looked like a herd of kine afflicted by cold.<br>Slaughtered or retreating in despondence being crushed the while, loud<br>cries, O Bharata, of oh and alas arose among the troops of the Pandavas.<br>Then Bhishma the son of Santanu, with bow always drawn to a circle, shot<br>therefrom blazing arrows that resembled virulent poison. And creating<br>continuous lines of arrows in all directions, that hero of rigid vows<br>slew Pandava car-warriors, naming each, O Bharata, beforehand. And then<br>when the troops of the Pandavas were routed and crushed all over the<br>field, the sun set and nothing could be seen. And then beholding Bhishma,<br>O bull of Bharata's race, proudly standing in battle, the Parthas<br>withdrew their forces (for nightly rest)."
