                            Sanjaya said,&#8212;"Approaching then thy son Chitrasena of great energy who<br>had thus been deprived of his car, thy son Vikarna caused him to mount on<br>his car. And during the progress of that general engagement, so fierce<br>and dreadful, Bhishma, the son of Santanu, impetuously rushed at<br>Yudhishthira. Then the Srinjayas with their cars, elephants, and horses,<br>trembled. And they regarded Yudhishthira to be already within the jaws of<br>Death. The lord Yudhishthira, however, of Kuru's race, accompanied by the<br>twins, proceeded towards that mighty bowman, that tiger among men viz.,<br>Bhishma. Then the son of Pandu, shooting in that battle thousands of<br>arrows, shrouded Bhishma like the clouds shrouding the sun. And those<br>numberless arrows, well shot by Yudhishthira, were received by the son of<br>Ganga in distinct sets by hundreds and thousands.[425] And so also, O<br>sire, innumerable were the arrows shot by Bhishma (in return), which<br>looked like flights of insects coursing through the air. In half the time<br>taken up by a wink of the eye, Bhishma, the son of Santanu, in that<br>battle, made Kunti's son invisible by means of his numberless shafts shot<br>in sets. Then king Yudhishthira, excited with rage, sped at the<br>high-souled Kaurava a long arrow resembling a snake of virulent poison.<br>That mighty car-warrior, Bhishma, however, O king, cut off in that<br>combat, with a horse-shoe (headed) arrow, that shaft shot from<br>Yudhishthira's bow before it could reach him. Having cut off that long<br>arrow resembling Death himself, Bhishma then slew in that battle the<br>steeds, decked with gold, of that prince of Kuru's line. Then<br>Yudhishthira the son of Pandu, abandoning that car whose steeds had been<br>slain, quickly mounted upon the car of the high-souled Nakula. Then<br>Bhishma that subjugator of hostile cities, excited with rage, and coming<br>upon the twins in that battle, covered them with arrows. Beholding those<br>two (brothers), O king, thus afflicted, with the arrows of Bhishma,<br>Yudhishthira began to reflect earnestly desirous, O monarch, of<br>(compassing) Bhishma's destruction. Then Yudhishthira, O king, urged his<br>friends and the rulers (on his side), saying,&#8212;'Slay Bhishma the son of<br>Santanu, uniting together.' Then all those rulers, hearing these words of<br>Pritha's son, surrounded the grandsire with a large number of cars. Thy<br>sire Devavrata then, thus surrounded on all sides, began to sport, O<br>king, with his bow, felling (all the while) many mighty car-warriors. Him<br>of Kuru's race, thus careering over the field of battle, the Pandavas<br>beheld resembling a young lion in the forest amid a herd of deer.<br>Uttering a loud roar in that battle and striking fear into the hearts of<br>brave warriors by means of his shafts, the Kshatriyas beholding him, O<br>king, were all struck with fear, like inferior animals upon seeing a<br>lion. Indeed the Kshatriyas beheld the movements of that lion of<br>Bharata's race in battle to resemble those of a conflagration aided by<br>the wind while consuming a heap of dry grass. And Bhishma in that battle<br>felled the heads of car-warriors like a skilful man felling (with stones)<br>ripe (palmyra) fruits from trees that bear them. And the heads of<br>warriors, O king, falling upon the surface of the earth produced a loud<br>noise resembling that of a stony shower. During the progress of that<br>fierce and dreadful battle a great confusion set in among all the troops.<br>And in consequence of that confusion the arrays (of both armies) were<br>broken. And the Kshatriyas summoning one another individually, approached<br>one another for fight. Then Sikhandin, sighting the grandsire of the<br>Bharatas, rushed at him impetuously, saying,&#8212;Wait, Wait&#8212;Remembering,<br>however, the femininity of Sikhandin, and disregarding him on that<br>account, Bhishma proceeded against the Srinjayas. Thereupon the<br>Srinjayas, beholding Bhishma in that great battle, were filled with joy.<br>And they set forth diverse kinds of loud shouts, mingled with the blare<br>of their conches. Then commenced a fierce battle in course of which cars<br>and elephants got entangled with one another. And it was that hour of the<br>day, O lord, when the sun was on the other side (of the meridian). Then<br>Dhrishtadyumna, the prince of the Panchalas, and that mighty car-warrior<br>Satyaki, greatly afflicted the (Bharata) host with showers of arrows and<br>lances. And with innumerable shafts, O king, these two began to smite<br>down thy warriors in that battle. Thy combatants, however, O bull among<br>men, though slaughtered in battle (thus) retreated not from the fight,<br>having formed an honourable resolution in that engagement. Indeed, thy<br>troops began to smite according to the measure of their courage. While,<br>however, O king, thy high-souled combatants were being slaughtered by the<br>illustrious son of Prishata, loud cries of woe were heard among them.<br>Hearing those loud cries, that couple of mighty car-warriors of thy army,<br>viz., Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti, quickly proceeded against Prishata's<br>son. And those mighty car-warriors, speedily slaying his steeds, together<br>covered Prishata's son with showers of arrows. Thereupon that mighty<br>car-warrior, viz., the prince of the Panchalas, quickly jumping down from<br>that car of his, mounted without loss of time the car of the high-souled<br>Satyaki. Then king Yudhishthira, supported by a large force, proceeded<br>against those chastisers of foes, viz., the two princes of Avanti excited<br>with rage. Similarly thy son, O sire, with every preparation, stood,<br>surrounding Vinda and Anuvinda in that battle (for supporting them).<br>Arjuna also in that battle, excited with rage, fought against many bulls<br>of the Kshatriya race, like the wielder of the thunder-bolt against the<br>Asuras. Drona also, who always does what is agreeable to thy son,<br>inflamed with wrath in that battle, began to consume the Panchalas like<br>fire consuming a heap of cotton. Thy other sons, O king, owning<br>Duryodhana as their chief, surrounding Bhishma in that battle, fought<br>against the Pandavas. Then when the sun assumed a red hue,[426] king<br>Duryodhana, O Bharata, addressing thy troops, said,&#8212;Lose no time&#8212;And<br>while they were thus battling and achieving feats difficult of<br>accomplishment, the sun having become invisible in consequence of his<br>retirement behind the western hill, there soon flowed, towards dusk, an<br>awful river whose current and billows were of blood, and which was<br>infested by innumerable jackals. And the field of battle became dreadful,<br>abounding as it did with spirits and with those jackals howling<br>hideously, forboding evil. Rakshasas and Pisachas and other cannibals<br>were seen all round, in hundreds and thousands. Then Arjuna, having<br>vanquished those kings headed by Susarman along with all their followers,<br>in the midst of their division, proceeded towards his tent. And the lord<br>Yudhishthira also of Kuru's race, accompanied by his brothers, and<br>followed by his troops, proceeded, O king, when night set in, towards his<br>tent. And Bhimasena, too, having vanquished those kings, viz., those<br>warriors headed by Duryodhana, proceeded towards his tent. And king<br>Duryodhana (with his troops), surrounding Bhishma, the son of Santanu, in<br>that great battle proceeded towards his tent. And Drona, and Drona's son,<br>and Kripa, and Salya, and Kritavarman of the Satwata race, surrounding<br>the whole (Dhartarashtra) army, proceeded towards their tents. And<br>similarly Satyaki also, O king, and Dhrishtadyumna, the son of Prishata,<br>surrounding their army, proceeded towards their tents. It was thus, O<br>king, that those chastisers of foes, viz., thy troops and the Pandavas,<br>ceased to fight when darkness came. Then the Pandavas, and the Kauravas,<br>retiring to their tents, entered the same, applauding one another. And<br>making arrangements for the protection of their brave warriors and<br>disposing outposts according to rule, they plucked out the arrows (from<br>their bodies) and bathed in diverse kinds of water. And Brahmanas<br>performed propitiatory rites for them, and bards sang their praises. And<br>those renowned men sported for a while in accompaniment with music both<br>vocal and instrumental. And for a while the whole scene resembled heaven<br>itself. And those bulls among men for a while spoke not of battle. And<br>when both armies abounding with tired men and elephants and steeds slept<br>there, they became, O monarch, beautiful to behold."
