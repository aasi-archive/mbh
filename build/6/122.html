                            "Sanjaya said,&#8212;'Stringing then his large bow and reverentially saluting<br>the grandsire, Arjuna, with eyes filled with tears, said these words, O<br>foremost one among the Kurus, O thou that art the first among all<br>wielders of weapons, command me, O invincible one, for I am thy slave!<br>What shall I do, O grandsire!&#8212;Unto him Santanu's son said,&#8212;My head, O<br>sire, hangeth down!&#8212;O foremost one among the Kuru's O Phalguni, get me a<br>pillow! Indeed, give me one without delay O hero, that would become my<br>bed! Thou O Partha, art competent, thou art the foremost of all wielders<br>of bows! Thou art conversant with the duties of Kshatriyas and thou art<br>endued with intelligence and goodness!&#8212;Then Phalguni, saying,&#8212;So be<br>it&#8212;desired to do Bhishma's bidding. Taking up Gandiva and a number of<br>straight shafts, and inspiring them with mantras, and obtaining the<br>permission of that illustrious and mighty car-warrior of Bharata's race,<br>Arjuna then, with three keen shafts endued with great force, supported<br>Bhishma's head. Then that chief of the Bharatas, viz., Bhishma of<br>virtuous soul, conversant with the truths of religion, seeing that<br>Arjuna, having divined his thought, had achieved that feat, became highly<br>gratified. And after that pillow had thus been given to him, he applauded<br>Dhananjaya. And casting his eyes upon all the Bharatas there, he<br>addressed Kunti's son Arjuna, that foremost of all warriors, that<br>enhancer of the joys of his friends and said,&#8212;Thou hast given me, O son<br>of Pandu, a pillow that becometh my bed! If thou hadst acted otherwise, I<br>would have cursed thee, from wrath! Even thus, O mighty-armed one, should<br>a Kshatriya, observant of his duties, sleep on the field of battle on his<br>bed of arrows!&#8212;Having addressed Vibhatsu thus, he then said unto all<br>those kings and princes that were present there, these words:&#8212;Behold ye<br>the pillow that the son of Pandu hath given me! I will sleep on this bed<br>till the Sun turneth to the northern solstice! Those king that will then<br>come to me will behold me (yield up my life)! When the Sun on his car of<br>great speed and unto which are yoked seven steeds, will proceed towards<br>the direction occupied by Vaisravana, verily, even then, will I yield up<br>my life like a dear friend dismissing a dear friend! Let a ditch be dug<br>here around my quarters ye kings! Thus pierced with hundreds of arrows<br>will I pay my adorations to the Sun? As regards yourselves, abandoning<br>enmity, cease ye from the fight, ye kings&#8212;<br><br>'Sanjaya continued,&#8212;"Then there came unto him some surgeons well trained<br>(in their science) and skilled in plucking out arrows, with all becoming<br>appliances (of their profession). Beholding them, the son of Ganga said<br>unto thy son,&#8212;'Let these physicians, after proper respect being paid to<br>them, be dismissed with presents of wealth. Brought to such a plight,<br>what need have I now of physicians? I have won the most laudable and the<br>highest state ordained in Kshatriya observances! Ye kings, lying as I do<br>on a bed of arrows, it is not proper for me to submit now to the<br>treatment of physicians. With these arrows on my body, ye rulers of men,<br>should I be burnt!'&#8212;Hearing these words of his, thy son Duryodhana<br>dismissed those physicians, having honoured them as they deserved. Then<br>those kings of diverse realms, beholding that constancy in virtue<br>displayed by Bhishma of immeasurable energy, were filled with wonder.<br>Having given a pillow to thy sire thus, those rulers of men, those mighty<br>car-warriors, viz., the Pandavas and the Kauravas, united together, once<br>more approached the high-souled Bhishma lying on that excellent bed of<br>his. Reverentially saluting that high-souled one and circumambulating him<br>thrice, and stationing guards all around for his protection, those<br>heroes, with bodies drenched in blood, repaired for rest towards their<br>own tents in the evening, their hearts plunged into grief and thinking of<br>what they had seen.<br><br>Then at the proper time, the mighty Madhava, approaching the Pandavas,<br>those mighty car-warriors cheerfully seated together and filled with joy<br>at the fall of Bhishma, said unto Dharma's son Yudhishthira these<br>words,&#8212;"By good luck victory hath been thine, O thou of Kuru's rare! By<br>good luck hath Bhishma been overthrown, who is unslayable by men, and is<br>a mighty car-warrior of aim incapable of being baffled! Or, perhaps, as<br>destiny would have it, that warrior who was master of every weapon,<br>having obtained thee for a foe that canst slay with thy eyes alone, hath<br>been consumed by thy wrathful eye!&#8212;Thus addressed by Krishna, king<br>Yudhishthira the just, replied unto Janardana, saying,&#8212;Through Thy grace<br>is Victory, through Thy wrath is Defeat! Thou art dispeller of the fears<br>of those that are devoted to thee. Thou art our refuge! It is not<br>wonderful that they should have victory whom Thou always protectest in<br>battle, and in whose welfare Thou art always engaged, O Kesava! Having<br>got Thee for our refuge, I do not regard anything as wonderful! Thus<br>addressed by him, Janardana answered with a smile,&#8212;O best of kings,<br>these words can come from thee alone!"
