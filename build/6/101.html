                            Sanjaya said, "Then the noble Abhimanyu of great energy, borne by his<br>steeds of a tawny hue, rushed at the mighty host of Duryodhana,<br>scattering his arrowy showers like the clouds pouring torrents of rain. O<br>son of Kuru's race, thy warriors, in that battle, were unable to resist<br>that slayer of foes, viz., Subhadra's son, who, excited with wrath and<br>possessed of wealth of arms, was then immersed in that inexhaustible<br>ocean of (Kaurava) forces. Death-dealing shafts, O king, shot by him in<br>that battle, despatched many heroic Kshatriyas to the regions of the king<br>of the departed spirits. Indeed, excited with wrath Subhadra's son in<br>that battle shot fierce and blazing arrows in profusion that resembled<br>snakes of virulent poison or rods of death himself. And Phalguni's son<br>speedily split into fragments car-warriors with their cars, steeds with<br>their riders, and elephant-warriors along with the huge animals they<br>rode. And the rulers of the earth, filled with joy, applauded those<br>mighty feats in battle and praised him also that achieved them. And the<br>son of Subhadra, O Bharata, tossed those divisions (of the Kaurava army)<br>like the tempest tossing a heap of cotton on all sides in the welkin.<br>Routed by him, O Bharata, the troops failed to find a protector, like<br>elephants sunk in a slough. Then, O best of men, having routed all<br>troops, Abhimanyu stood, O king, like a blazing fire without a curl of<br>smoke. Indeed, O king, thy warriors were incapable of bearing that slayer<br>of foes, like insects impelled by fate unable to bear a blazing fire.<br>That mighty car-warrior and great bowman, having struck all the foes of<br>the Pandavas, looked at that moment like Vasava himself armed with the<br>thunder. And his bow, the back of whose staff was decked with gold, as it<br>moved on every side, seemed, O king, like the lightning's flash as it<br>spotted amid the clouds. And well-tempered and sharp shafts came from his<br>bow-string in that battle like flights of bees, O king, from blossoming<br>trees in the forest. And as the high-souled son of Subhadra careered on<br>the field on his car whose limbs were decked with gold, people were<br>incapable of finding an opportunity (for striking him). Confounding Kripa<br>and Drona and mighty son of Drona, as also the ruler of the Sindhus, the<br>great bowman moved on the field of battle with great activity and skill.<br>As he consumed thy troops, O Bharata, I beheld his bow incessantly drawn<br>to a circle and resembling on that account the circular halo of light<br>that is sometimes seen around the Sun. Brave Kshatriyas, beholding him<br>endued with such activity and scorching the foe thus, thought, in<br>consequence of those feats, that the world contained two Phalgunis.<br>Indeed, O king, the vast host of the Bharatas, afflicted by him, reeled<br>hither and thither like a woman drunk with wine. Routing that large army<br>and causing many mighty car-warriors to tremble, he gladdened his friends<br>(like Vasava gladdening the celestials) after vanquishing Maya. And while<br>being routed by him in that battle, thy troops uttered loud exclamations<br>of woe that resembled the roar of the clouds. Hearing that awful wail thy<br>troops, O Bharata, that resembled the roar of the very sea at full tide<br>when agitated by the winds, Duryodhana then, O king, addressed the son of<br>Rishyasringa and said, 'This Abhimanyu singly, O thou of mighty arms,<br>like a second Phalguni, routeth from rage (my) army like Vritra routing<br>the celestial host. I do not see any other efficacious medicine for him<br>in battle than thyself, O best of Rakshasas, that art well-skilled in<br>every science. Therefore, go speedily and slay the heroic son of Subhadra<br>in battle. As regards ourselves, headed by Bhishma and Drona, we will<br>slay Partha himself.' Thus addressed, the mighty and valiant Rakshasa<br>speedily went to battle at the command of thy son, uttering loud roars<br>like the clouds themselves in the season of rains. And in consequence of<br>that loud noise, O king, the vast host of the Pandavas trembled<br>throughout like the ocean when agitated by the wind. And many combatants,<br>O king, terrified by those roars, giving up dear life, fell prostrate on<br>the earth. Filled with joy and taking up his bow with arrow fixed on the<br>string, and apparently dancing on the terrace of his car, that Rakshasa<br>proceeded against Abhimanyu himself. Then the angry Rakshasa, having in<br>that battle got Arjuna's son within reach, began to rout his ranks,&#8212;even<br>those that stood not far from him. Indeed, the Rakshasa rushed in battle<br>against that mighty Pandava host which he began to slaughter, like Vala<br>rushing against the celestial host. Attacked in battle by that Rakshasa<br>of terrible mien, the slaughter was very great, O sire, that took place<br>amongst those troops. Exhibiting his prowess, the Rakshasa began to rout<br>that vast force of the Pandavas, with thousands of arrows. Thus<br>slaughtered by that Rakshasa of terrible visage, the Pandava army fled<br>away from excess of fear. Grinding that army like an elephant grinding<br>lotus-stalks, the mighty Rakshasa then rushed in battle against the sons<br>of Draupadi. Then those great bowmen, accomplished in fighting, viz., the<br>sons of Draupadi, rushed towards the Rakshasa in battle like five planets<br>rushing against the Sun. That best of Rakshasa then was afflicted by<br>those brothers endued with great energy, like the Moon afflicted by the<br>five planets of the awful occasion of the dissolution of the world. Then<br>the mighty Prativindhya quickly pierced the Rakshasa with whetted shafts,<br>sharp as battle-axes and furnished with points capable of penetrating<br>every armour. Thereupon that foremost of Rakshasas, with his armour<br>pierced through, looked like a mass of clouds penetrated by the rays of<br>the Sun. Pierced with these shafts furnished with golden wings,<br>Rishyasringa's son, O king, looked resplendent like a mountain with<br>blazing crests. Then those five brothers in that great battle, pierced<br>that foremost of Rakshasas with many whetted shafts of golden wings.<br>Pierced with those terrible shafts resembling angry snakes, Alamvusha, O<br>king, became inflamed with rage like the king of the serpents himself.<br>Deeply pierced, O king, within only a few moments, O sire, by those great<br>car-warriors, the Rakshasa, much afflicted, remained senseless for a long<br>while. Regaining his consciousness then, and swelling through rage to<br>twice his dimensions, he cut off their arrows and standards and bows. And<br>as if smiling the while he struck each of them with five arrows. Then<br>that mighty Rakshasa and great car-warrior, Alamvusha, excited with<br>wrath, and as if dancing on the terrace of his car, quickly slew the<br>steeds, and then the charioteers, of those five illustrious adversaries<br>of his. And burning with rage he once more pierced them with sharp arrows<br>of diverse shades by hundreds and thousands. Then that wanderer of the<br>night, viz., the Rakshasa Alamvusha, having deprived those great bowmen<br>of their cars, rushed impetuously at them, wishing to despatch them to<br>Yama's abode. Beholding them (thus) afflicted in battle by that<br>wicked-souled Rakshasa, the son of Arjuna rushed at him. Then the battle<br>that took place between him and the cannibal resembled that between<br>Vritra and Vasava. And the mighty car-warriors of thy army, as also of<br>the Pandavas, all became spectators of that engagement. Encountering each<br>other in fierce battle, blazing with wrath, endued with great might, and<br>with eyes red in rage, each beheld the other in that battle to resemble<br>the Yuga fire. And that engagement between them became fierce and awful<br>like that between Sakra and Samvara in days of old in the battle between<br>the gods and Asuras."
