                            [(Bhagavad Gita Chapter XIV)]<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'I will again declare (to thee) that supernal science<br>of sciences, that excellent science, knowing which all the munis have<br>attained to the highest perfection from (the fetters of) this body.[273]<br>Resorting to this science, and attaining to my nature, they are not<br>reborn even on (the occasion of) a (new) creation and are not disturbed<br>at the universal dissolution. The mighty Brahma is a womb for me. Therein<br>I place the (living) germ. Thence, O Bharata, the birth of all beings<br>taketh place. Whatever (bodily) forms, O son of Kunti, are born in all<br>wombs, of them Brahma is the mighty womb, (and) I the seed-imparting<br>Sire.[274] Goodness, passion, darkness, these qualities, born of nature,<br>bind down, O thou of mighty arms, the eternal embodied [soul] in the<br>body.[275] Amongst these, Goodness, from its unsullied nature, being<br>enlightening and free from misery, bindeth (the soul), O sinless one,<br>with the attainment of happiness and of knowledge. Know that passion,<br>having desire for its essence, is born of thirst and attachment. That, O<br>son of Kunti, bindeth the embodied (soul) by the attachment of work.<br>Darkness, however, know, is born of ignorance, (and) bewilders all<br>embodied [soul]. That bindeth, O Bharata, by error, indolence, and sleep.<br>Goodness uniteth (the soul) with pleasure; Passion, O Bharata, uniteth<br>with work; but darkness, veiling knowledge, uniteth with error. Passion<br>and darkness, being repressed, Goodness remaineth, O Bharata. Passion and<br>goodness (being repressed), darkness (remaineth); (and) darkness and<br>goodness (being repressed), passion (remaineth). When in this body, in<br>all its gates, the light of knowledge is produced, then should one know<br>that goodness hath been developed there. Avarice, activity, performance<br>of works, want of tranquillity, desire,&#8212;these, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>are born when passion is developed. Gloom, inactivity, error, and<br>delusion also,&#8212;these, O son of Kuru's race, are born when darkness is<br>developed. When the holder of a body goeth to dissolution while goodness<br>is developed, then he attaineth to the spotless regions of those that<br>know the Supreme. Going to dissolution when passion prevails, one is born<br>among those that are attached to work. Likewise, dissolved during<br>darkness, one is born in wombs that beget the ignorant. The fruit of good<br>action is said to be good and untainted. The fruit, however, of passion,<br>is misery; (and) the fruit of Darkness is ignorance. From goodness is<br>produced knowledge; from passion, avarice; (and) from darkness are error<br>and delusion, and also ignorance. They that dwell in goodness go on high;<br>they that are addicted to passion dwell in the middle; (while) they that<br>are of darkness, being addicted to the lowest quality, go down. When an<br>observer recognises none else to be an agent save the qualities, and<br>knows that which is beyond (the qualities), he attaineth to my nature.<br>The embodied [soul], by transcending these three qualities which<br>constitute the source of all bodies, enjoyeth immortality, being freed<br>from birth, death, decrepitude, and misery.'[276]<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'What are indications, O Lord, of one who hath transcended<br>these three qualities? What is his conduct? How also doth one transcend<br>these three qualities?"<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'He who hath no aversion for light, activity, and<br>even delusion, O son of Pandu, when they are present, nor desireth them<br>when they are absent,[277] who, seated as one unconcerned, is not shaken<br>by those qualities; who sitteth and moveth not, thinking that it is the<br>qualities (and not he) that are engaged (in their respective functions);<br>to whom pain and pleasure are alike, who is self-contained, and to whom a<br>sod of earth, a stone, and gold are alike; to whom the agreeable and the<br>disagreeable are the same; who hath discernment; to whom censure and<br>praise are the same; to whom honour and dishonour are the same; who<br>regardeth friend and foe alike; who hath renounced all exertion&#8212;is said<br>to have transcended the qualities. He also who worshippeth Me with<br>exclusive devotion, he, transcending those qualities, becometh fit for<br>admission into the nature of Brahma. For I am the stay of Brahma, of<br>immortality, of undestructibility, of eternal piety, and of unbroken<br>felicity.'[278]
