                            Sanjaya said, "Arjuna covered with his straight shafts the mighty<br>car-warrior Salya who was struggling vigorously in battle. And he pierced<br>Susarman and Kripa with three arrows each. And in that battle the<br>Atiratha Arjuna, afflicting thy host, struck the ruler of the<br>Pragjyotishas, and Jayadratha the king of the Sindhus, and Chitrasena,<br>and Vikarna, and Kritavarman, and Durmarshana, O monarch, and those two<br>mighty car-warriors, viz., the princes of Avanti, each with three arrows<br>winged with the feathers of the Kanka and the peacock. Jayadratha,<br>staying on the car of Chitrasena, pierced Partha (in return), O Bharata,<br>and then, without loss of time, Bhima also, with his shafts. And Salya,<br>and that foremost of car-warriors, viz., Kripa, both pierced Jishnu, O<br>monarch, with diverse arrows capable of penetrating into the very vitals.<br>Thy sons headed by Chitrasena, O king, each quickly pierced Arjuna and<br>Bhimasena in that battle, O sire, with five sharp shafts. Those two<br>foremost of car-warriors however, viz., those sons of Kunti, those bulls<br>of Bharata's race, began in that battle to afflict the mighty host of the<br>Trigartas. Susarman (in return) pierced Partha with nine swift arrows,<br>and uttered a loud shout frightening the vast host (of the Pandavas). And<br>other heroic car-warriors pierced Bhimasena and Dhananjaya with many<br>straight-going arrows of keen points and golden wings. Amid these<br>car-warriors, however, those two bulls of Bharata's race, viz., the two<br>sons of Kunti, those great car-warriors, looked exceedingly beautiful.<br>And they seemed to sport amid them like two furious lions amid a herd of<br>kine. Cutting off in various ways the bows and arrows of many brave<br>warriors in that battle, those two heroes felled the heads of combatants<br>by hundreds upon hundreds. Innumerable cars were broken, and steeds by<br>hundreds were slain, and many elephants, along with their riders, were<br>laid low on the field in that dreadful battle. And car-warriors and<br>horsemen and elephant-riders in large numbers, O king, deprived of life<br>were seen moving in convulsions all over the field. And the earth was<br>covered with slain elephants and foot-soldiers in large bands, and steeds<br>deprived of life, and cars broken in diverse ways. And the prowess we<br>beheld there of Partha was highly wonderful, in as much as holding in<br>check all those heroes, that mighty warrior caused a great slaughter.<br>Kripa, and Kritavarman, and Jayadratha, the ruler of the Sindhus, and<br>Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti,&#8212;these did not forsake the battle. Then<br>that great bowman Bhima, and that mighty car-warrior Arjuna, began in<br>that battle to rout the fierce host of the Kauravas. The kings (in that<br>army) quickly sped at Dhananjaya's car myriads upon myriads and millions<br>upon millions of arrows furnished with peacock feathers. Partha, however,<br>checking those arrows by means of his own arrowy showers, began to send<br>those mighty car-warriors to Yama's abode. The great car-warrior Salya<br>then, excited with wrath and as if sporting in that battle, struck Partha<br>in the chest with some straight shafts of broad heads. Partha then,<br>cutting off by means of five shafts Salya's bow and leathern fence,<br>pierced the latter deeply in the very vitals with many arrows of keen<br>points. Taking up another bow capable of bearing a great strain, the<br>ruler of the Madras then furiously attacked Jishnu with three arrows, O<br>king, and Vasudeva with five. And he struck Bhimasena in the arms and the<br>chest with nine arrows. Then Drona, O king, and that mighty car-warrior,<br>viz., the ruler of the Magadhas, commanded by Duryodhana, both came to<br>that spot where those two mighty car-warriors, viz., Partha and<br>Bhimasena, were slaughtering the mighty host of the Kuru king. Jayatsena<br>(the king of the Magadhas) then, O bull of Bharata's race pierced Bhima,<br>that wielder of awful weapons in battle, with eight sharp arrows. Bhima,<br>however, pierced him (in return) with ten arrows, and once more with<br>five. And with another broad-headed shaft he felled Jayatsena's<br>charioteer from his niche in the car. The steeds (of his car), no longer<br>restrained, ran wildly in all directions and thus carried away the ruler<br>of the Magadhas (from battle) in the sight of all the troops. Meanwhile<br>Drona, noticing an opening, pierced Bhimasena, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>with eight keen shafts furnished with heads shaped after the frog's<br>mouth. Bhima, however, ever delighting in battle, pierced the preceptor,<br>who was worthy of paternal reverence, with five broad-headed arrows, and<br>then, O Bharata, with sixty. Arjuna, again piercing Susarman with a large<br>number of arrows made (wholly) of iron, destroyed his troops like the<br>tempest destroying mighty masses of clouds. Then Bhishma, and the king<br>(viz., Duryodhana), and Vrihadvala, the ruler of the Kosalas, excited<br>with rage, advanced upon Bhimasena and Dhananjaya. At this, the heroic<br>warriors of the Pandava army, and Dhrishtadyumna the son of Prishata,<br>rushed in battle against Bhishma who was advancing like Death himself<br>with wide-open mouth. Sikhandin also, sighting the grandsire of the<br>Bharatas, was filled with joy and rushed at him, abandoning all fear of<br>the mighty car-warrior. Then all the Parthas with Yudhishthira at their<br>head, placing Sikhandin in the van, and uniting with the Srinjayas,<br>fought with Bhishma in battle. And similarly all the warriors of thy<br>army, placing Bhishma of regulated vows in their van, fought in battle<br>with all the Parthas headed by Sikhandin. The battle then that commenced<br>there between the Kauravas and the sons of Pandu for the sake of<br>Bhishma's victory or victory over Bhishma, was exceedingly terrible.<br>Indeed, in that game of battle, played for the sake of victory or the<br>reverse, Bhishma, O monarch, became the stake on which the victory of thy<br>army depended. Then Dhrishtadyumna, O king, commanded all the troops,<br>saying, 'Rush against the son of Ganga. Do not fear, ye best of<br>car-warriors. Hearing those words of their generalissimo, the army of the<br>Pandavas quickly advanced against Bhishma, ready to lay down their lives<br>in that dreadful battle. Bhishma then, that foremost of car-warriors,<br>received that large host rushing towards him, like the continent<br>receiving the surging sea."
