                            Dhritarashtra said, "When mine and the hostile hosts were thus formed<br>into battle array, how did the foremost of smiters begin to strike?"<br><br>Sanjaya said, "When all the divisions were thus arrayed, the combatants<br>waited, each cased in mail, and with their beautiful standards all<br>upraised. And beholding the (Kuru) host that resembled the limitless<br>ocean, thy son Duryodhana, O king, stationed within it, said unto all the<br>combatants on thy side, 'Cased in mail (as ye are), begin ye the fight'.<br>The combatants then, entertaining cruel intentions, and abandoning their<br>very lives, all rushed against the Pandavas, with standards upraised. The<br>battle that took place then was fierce and made the hair stand on end.<br>And the cars and elephants all got mixed together. And shafts with<br>beautiful feathers, and endued with great energy and sharp points, shot<br>by car-warriors fell upon elephants and horses. And when the battle began<br>in this way, the venerable Kuru grandsire, the mighty-armed Bhishma of<br>terrible prowess, cased in mail, taking up his bow, and approaching them,<br>showered an arrowy downpour on the heroic son of Subhadra, and the mighty<br>car-warrior Arjuna, and the ruler of the Kekayas and Virata, and<br>Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race, as also upon the Chedi and the Matsya<br>warriors. And that mighty array (of the Pandavas) wavered at the onset of<br>that hero. And terrific was the encounter that took place between all the<br>combatants. And horse-men and car-warriors and foremost of steeds fell<br>fast. And the car-divisions of the Pandavas began to fly away. Then that<br>tiger among men, Arjuna, beholding that mighty car-warrior Bhishma,<br>angrily said unto him of Vrishni's race. 'Proceed to the place where the<br>grandsire is. O thou of Vrishni's race, it is evident that this Bhishma,<br>with wrath excited, will annihilate for Duryodhana's benefit my host. And<br>this Drona, and Kripa and Salya and Vikarna, O Janardana, united with<br>Dhritarashtra's sons headed by Duryodhana, and protected by this firm<br>bowman, will slaughter the Panchalas. Even I, therefore, shall stay<br>Bhishma for the sake of my troops, O Janardana.' Unto him Vasudeva then<br>said, 'Be careful, O Dhananjaya, for I will soon take thee, O hero,<br>towards the grandsire's car.' Having said this, O king, Saurin took that<br>car, which was celebrated over the world, before the car of Bhishma. With<br>numerous banners all waving, with steeds looking handsome like a flight<br>of (white) cranes, with standard upraised on which was the ape roaring<br>fiercely, upon his large car of solar effulgence and whose rattle<br>resembled roar of the clouds, slaughtering the Kaurava divisions and the<br>Surasenas also, the son of Pandu, that enhancer of the joys of friends<br>speedily came to the encounter. Him (thus) rushing impetuously like an<br>infuriate elephant and (thus) frightening in a battle brave combatants<br>and felling them with his shafts, Bhishma the son of Santanu, protected<br>by the warriors headed by Saindhava and by the combatants of the East and<br>the Sauviras and the Kekayas, encountered with great impetuosity. Who<br>else save the Kuru grandsire and those car-warriors, viz., Drona and<br>Vikartana's son (Karna), are capable of advancing in battle against the<br>bearer of the bow called Gandiva? Then, O great king, Bhishma, the<br>grandsire of the Kauravas, struck Arjuna with seventy-seven arrows and<br>Drona (struck him) with five and twenty, and Kripa with fifty, and<br>Duryodhana with four and sixty, and Salya with nine arrows; and Drona's<br>son, that tiger among men, with sixty, and Vikarna with three arrows; and<br>Saindhava with nine and Sakuni with five. And Artayani O king, pierced<br>Pandu's son with three broad-headed arrows. And (though) pierced on all<br>sides by them with sharp arrows, that great bowman,[361] that<br>mighty-armed (warrior), wavered not like mountain that is pierced (with<br>arrows). Thereupon he, the diadem-decked, of immeasurable soul, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, in return pierced Bhishma with five and twenty, and Kripa<br>with nine arrows, and Drona with sixty, O tiger among men, and Vikarna<br>with three arrows; and Artayani with three arrows, and the king<br>(Duryodhana) also with five. And then Satyaki, and Virata and<br>Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race, and the sons of Draupadi, and<br>Abhimanyu, all surrounded him, (proceeding to his support). Then the<br>prince of the Panchalas, supported by the Somakas, advanced towards the<br>great bowman Drona who was engaged in seeking the welfare of Ganga's son.<br>Then Bhishma, that foremost of car-warriors, speedily pierced the son of<br>Pandu with eighty sharp arrows, upon which the combatants on thy side<br>were much gratified. Hearing the shouts of those lions among<br>car-warriors, Dhananjaya, endued with great prowess, then cheerfully<br>entered into the midst of those lions among car-warriors and sported with<br>his bow, O king, (successively) aiming those mighty car-warriors. Then<br>that ruler of men, king Duryodhana, said unto Bhishma, beholding his own<br>troops (thus) afflicted in battle by the son of Pritha. 'This mighty son<br>of Pandu, O sire, accompanied by Krishna, felling all our troops, cutteth<br>down our roots, even though thou, O son of Ganga, and that foremost of<br>car-warriors, Drona, are alive. O monarch, it is for thee only that this<br>Karna, laying aside his weapons, doth not fight with the sons of Pritha<br>in battle (though) he is ever a well-wisher of mine, Do, therefore, that,<br>O son of Ganga by which Phalguni may be slain. 'Thus addressed, O king,<br>thy sire Devavrata, saying, 'Fie to Kshatriya usage', then proceeded<br>towards Partha's car. And all the kings, O monarch, seeing both those<br>warriors with white steeds yoked unto their cars stationed (for battle),<br>set up loud leonine roars, and also blew their conches, O sire. And<br>Drona's son and Duryodhana, and thy son Vikarna, surrounding Bhishma in<br>that combat, stood, O sire, for battle. And so all the Pandavas,<br>surrounding Dhananjaya, stood for fierce conflict. And the battle then<br>commenced. And the son of Ganga pierced Partha in that combat with nine<br>shafts. And Arjuna pierced him in return with ten shafts penetrating into<br>the very vitals. Then, with a thousand arrows, well shot, Pandu's son<br>Arjuna, famed for his skill in battle, shrouded Bhishma on all sides.<br>That arrowy net, however, of Partha, O king, Bhishma the son of Santanu<br>baffled with an arrowy net (of his own). And both well-pleased, and both<br>delighting in battle, fought with each other without each gaining any<br>advantage over the other, and each desirous of counteracting the other's<br>feats. And the successive flights of arrows shot from Bhishma's bow were<br>seen to be dispersed by the shafts of Arjuna. And so the flights of<br>arrows shot by Arjuna, cut off by the arrows of Ganga's son, all fell<br>down on the ground. And Arjuna pierced Bhishma with five and twenty<br>arrows of sharp points. And Bhishma, too, in that combat, pierced Partha<br>in return with nine arrows. And those two mighty warriors, those<br>chastisers of foes, piercing each other's steeds, and also the shafts and<br>the wheels of each other's cars, began to sport. Then, O king, Bhishma,<br>that foremost of smiters, struck Vasudeva between his two breasts with<br>three arrows. And the slayer of Madhu, struck with those shafts shot from<br>Bhishma's bow, shone in that battle, O king, like a flowering Kinsuka.<br>Then Arjuna, indignant at seeing Madhava, pierced in that combat the<br>charioteer of Ganga's son with three arrows. And both heroes, striving<br>with each other against each other's car, succeeded not in taking aim at<br>each other in the combat. And in consequence of the ability and dexterity<br>of the charioteers of both those warriors, both displayed, O king,<br>beautiful circles and advancings and retreatings in respect of their<br>moving cars. And, O monarch, seeing the opportunity to strike, they<br>frequently changed positions, O king, for obtaining what they sought. And<br>both the heroes blew their conches, mingling that blare with their<br>leonine roars. And those mighty car-warriors twang their bows, both in<br>the same manner. And with the blare of their conches and the rattle of<br>their car-wheels, the very Earth was suddenly rent. And it began to<br>tremble and produce subterranean noises. And nobody, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, could detect any latches in either of them. Both of them was<br>possessed of great might and great courage in battle, each was other's<br>match. And by (the sight of) his standard alone, the Kauravas could<br>approach him (for aid). And so the Pandavas approached Pritha's son (for<br>aid), guided by his standard only. And beholding, O king, prowess thus<br>displayed by those two foremost of men, O Bharata, all creatures<br>(present) in that battle were filled with wonder. And none, O Bharata,<br>observed any difference between the two, just as none finds any<br>transgression in a person observant of morality. And both of them (at<br>times) became perfectly invisible in consequence of clouds of arrows. And<br>soon enough both of them in that battle became visible. And the gods with<br>Gandharvas and the Charanas, and the great Rishis beholding their<br>prowess, said unto one another. These mighty car-warriors when excited<br>with rage, are incapable of ever being vanquished in battle by all the<br>worlds with the gods, the Asuras and the Gandharvas. This highly<br>wonderful battle would be wonderful in all the worlds. Indeed, a battle<br>such as this will never take place again. Bhishma is incapable of being<br>conquered in combat by Pritha's son of great intelligence, showering his<br>arrows in battle, with bow and car and steeds. So also that great bowman,<br>the son of Pandu, incapable of being vanquished in battle by the very<br>gods, Bhishma is not competent to conquer in combat. As long as the world<br>itself will last, so long will this battle continue equally. We heard<br>these words, O king, fraught with the praise of Ganga's son and Arjuna in<br>battle bruited about there. And while those two were engaged in<br>displaying their prowess, other warriors of thy side and of the Pandavas,<br>O Bharata, slew one another in battle, with sharp-edged scimitars, and<br>polished battle-axes, and innumerable arrows, and diverse kinds of<br>weapons. And the brave combatants of both armies cut one another down,<br>while that terrible and murderous conflict lasted. And the encounter<br>also, O king, that took place between Drona and the prince of the<br>Panchalas, was awful."
