                            Sanjaya said, "Then thy sire, excited with wrath, began to strike the<br>Parthas and their troops all round, with excellent shafts of great<br>sharpness. And he pierced Bhima with twelve shafts, and Satyaki with<br>nine. And having pierced Nakula with three shafts, he pierced Sahadeva<br>with seven. And he pierced Yudhishthira in the arms and the chest with<br>twelve shafts. And piercing Dhrishtadyumna also, that mighty warrior<br>uttered a loud roar. Him Nakula pierced (in return) with twelve shafts,<br>and Satyaki with three. And Dhrishtadyumna pierced him with seventy<br>shafts, and Bhimasena with seven. And Yudhishthira pierced the grandsire<br>in return with twelve shafts. Drona (on the other hand), having pierced<br>Satyaki, pierced Bhimasena next. And he pierced each of them with five<br>sharp shafts, each of which resembled the rod of Death. Each of those<br>two, however, pierced Drona, that bull among Brahmanas, in return, with<br>three straight shafts. The Sauviras, the Kitavas, the Easterners, the<br>Westerners, the Northerners, the Malavas, the Abhishahas, the Surasenas,<br>the Sivis, and the Vasatis, did not avoid Bhishma in battle although they<br>were incessantly slaughtered by him with sharp shafts. And similarly<br>kings coming from diverse countries and armed with diverse weapons,<br>approached the Pandavas (without seeking to avoid them in battle). And<br>the Pandavas, O king, surrounded the grandsire on all sides. Surrounded<br>on all sides, yet unvanquished by that large body of cars, Bhishma blazed<br>up like a fire in the midst of a forest, and consumed his foes. His car<br>was his fire-chamber; his bow constituted the (flames of that fire);<br>swords, darts, and maces, constituted the fuel; his shafts were the<br>sparks (of that fire); and Bhishma was himself the fire that consumed the<br>foremost of Kshatriyas. Indeed, with shafts furnished with golden wings<br>and vulturine feathers and endued with great energy, with barbed arrows,<br>and nalikas, and long shafts, he covered the hostile host. And he felled<br>elephants and car-warriors also with his sharp shafts. And he made that<br>large body of cars resemble a forest of palmyras shorn of their leafy<br>heads. And that mighty armed warrior, that foremost of all wielders of<br>weapons, O king, deprived cars and elephants and steeds of their riders<br>in that conflict. And hearing the twang of his bow-string and the noise<br>of his palms, loud as the roar of the thunder, all the troops trembled, O<br>Bharata. The shafts of thy sire, O bull of Bharata's race, told on the<br>foe. Indeed, shot from Bhishma's bow they did not strike the coats of<br>mail only (but pierced them through). And we beheld, O king, many cars<br>destitute of their brave riders dragged over the field of battle, O<br>monarch, by the fleet steeds yoked unto them. Fourteen thousand<br>car-warriors, belonging to the Chedis, the Kasis, and the Karushas, of<br>great celebrity and noble parentage, prepared to lay down their lives,<br>unretreating from the field, and owning excellent standards decked with<br>gold, having met with Bhishma in battle who resembled the Destroyer<br>himself with wide-open mouth, all went to the other world along with<br>their cars, steeds, and elephants. And we beheld there, O king, cars by<br>hundreds and thousands, some with their axles and bottoms broken, and<br>some, O Bharata, with broken wheels. And the earth was strewn with cars<br>broken along with their wooden fences, with the prostrate forms of<br>car-warriors, with shafts, with beautiful but broken coats of mail, with<br>axes. O monarch; with maces and short arrows and sharp shafts, with<br>bottoms of cars, with quivers and broken wheels, O sire, with innumerable<br>bows and scimitars and heads decked with ear-rings; with leathern fences<br>and gloves and overthrown standards, and with bows broken in various<br>parts. And elephants, O king, destitute of riders, and slain horsemen (of<br>the Pandava army), lay dead. The valiant Pandavas notwithstanding all<br>their efforts, could not rally those car-warriors, who, afflicted by the<br>shafts of Bhishma, were flying away from the field. Indeed, O king, that<br>mighty host while being slaughtered by Bhishma endued with energy equal<br>to that of Indra himself, broke so completely that no two persons fled<br>together. With its cars, elephants, and steeds overthrown, and with its<br>standards laid low in profusion, the army of the sons of Pandu, deprived<br>of senses, uttered loud exclamations of woe. And at that time, sire slew<br>son, and son slew sire, and friend smote dear friend, impelled by fate.<br>And many combatants of the Pandavas army, throwing aside their armour,<br>were seen flying in all directions with dishevelled hair. Indeed, the<br>Pandava troops looked like bulls running wild in fear, and no longer<br>restrained by the yoke. Indeed, loud were the exclamations, we heard of<br>woe that they uttered.<br><br>"Then that delighter of the Yadavas, beholding the Pandava army breaking,<br>reined the excellent car (that he guided), and addressing Vibhatsu the<br>son of Pritha, said,&#8212;That hour is come, O Partha, which thou hadst hoped<br>for. Strike now, O tiger among men, or thou wilt be deprived of thy<br>senses. Formerly, O hero, thou saidst, O Partha, in that conclave of<br>kings in Virata's city, in the presence also of Sanjaya, these words:&#8212;'I<br>will slay all the warriors of Dhritarashtra's son, all of them with their<br>followers, including, Bhishma and Drona, that would fight with me in<br>battle&#8212;O son of Kunti, O chastiser of foes, make those words of thine<br>true. Remembering the duty of a Kshatriya, fight, without any anxiety.'<br>Thus addressed by Vasudeva, Arjuna hung down his head and looked askance<br>at him. And Vibhatsu replied very unwillingly, saying, 'To acquire<br>sovereignty with hell in the end, having slain those who should not be<br>slain, or the woes of an exile in the woods,&#8212;(these are the<br>alternatives). Which of these should I achieve? Urge the steeds, O<br>Hrishikesa, I will do thy bidding. I will overthrow the Kuru grandsire<br>Bhishma, that invincible warrior.'&#8212;Thus asked, Madhava urged those<br>steeds of a silvery hue, to the spot where Bhishma, incapable of being<br>looked at like the Sun himself, was staying. Then that large host of<br>Yudhishthira rallied and came again to the fight, beholding the<br>mighty-armed Partha proceeding for an encounter with Bhishma. Then<br>Bhishma that foremost one among the Kurus, repeatedly roared like a lion.<br>And he soon covered Dhananjaya's car with a shower of arrows. Within a<br>trice that car of his with its steeds and charioteer, became entirely<br>invisible in consequence of that thick shower of arrows. Vasudeva,<br>however, without fear, mustering patience, and endued with great<br>activity, urged those steeds mangled with Bhishma's shafts. Then Partha,<br>taking up his celestial bow of twang loud as the roar of the clouds,<br>caused Bhishma's bow to drop from his hands, cutting it (into fragments)<br>by means of his sharp shafts. Then thy sire, the Kuru hero, whose bow had<br>thus been cut off, stringed another large bow within the twinkling of the<br>eye. Arjuna, however, excited with wrath, cut that bow also of his. The<br>son of Santanu applauded that lightness of hand displayed by Arjuna,<br>saying, 'Well done, Well done, O mighty-armed one. Well done, O son of<br>Kunti.'&#8212;Having addressed him thus, Bhishma took up another beautiful bow<br>in that battle, and shot many arrows at Partha's car. And Vasudeva showed<br>great skill in the management of steeds, for, displaying the circling<br>motion he baffled all those arrows (of Bhishma). Mangled with the arrows<br>of Bhishma, those two tigers among men looked beautiful like two angry<br>bulls marked with scratches of horns. Then that slayer of hostile heroes,<br>viz., the mighty-armed Vasudeva of Madhu's race beholding that Partha was<br>fighting mildly and that Bhishma was incessantly scattering his arrowy<br>showers in battle, and that stationed between the two hosts, he latter<br>was scorching everything like the Sun himself, smiting down the foremost<br>of Yudhishthira's combatants, and, in fact, achieving feat on<br>Yudhishthira's army like unto what happeneth at the end of the Yuga,<br>could not any longer bear it. Abandoning then, O sire, Partha's steeds<br>that looked like silver, and filled with wrath, that great lord of Yoga<br>powers jumped down from that great car. Repeatedly roaring like a lion,<br>the mighty Krishna of great energy and immeasurable splendour, the Lord<br>of Universe, with eyes red as copper from rage, and having his bare arms<br>alone for his weapons, rushed towards Bhishma, whip in hand, desirous of<br>slaying him and seeming to split the universe itself with his tread.<br>Beholding Madhava in the vicinity of Bhishma and about to fall upon him<br>in that furious battle, the hearts of all the combatants seemed to be in<br>a stupor. 'Bhishma is slain, Bhishma is slain.'&#8212;These loud exclamations<br>were heard there, O king, caused by the fear inspired by Vasudeva. Robed<br>in yellow silk, and himself dark as the lapis lazuli, Janarddana, when he<br>pursued Bhishma, looked beautiful as a mass of clouds charged with<br>lightning. Like a lion towards an elephant, or the leader of a bovine<br>herd upon another of his species, that bull of Madhu's race, with a loud<br>roar, impetuously rushed towards Bhishma. Beholding him of eyes like<br>lotus petals (thus) rushing towards him in that battle, Bhishma began to<br>fearlessly draw his large bow. And with a fearless heart he addressed<br>Govinda, saying, 'Come, come, O thou of eyes like lotus petals. O God of<br>the gods, I bow to thee. O best of the Satwatas, throw me down today in<br>this great battle. O god, slain by thee in battle, O sinless one, great<br>will be the good done to me, O Krishna, in every respect in the world.<br>Amongst all, in the three worlds, great is the honour done to me today in<br>battle, O Govinda. Strike me as thou pleasest, for I am thy slave, O<br>sinless one.' Meanwhile, the mighty-armed Partha. quickly following<br>Kesava behind, seized him by encircling him with his two arms. That best<br>of male beings, viz., Krishna, of eyes like lotus petals, seized by<br>Partha, still proceeded with great speed, bearing the latter away with<br>him. The mighty Partha, that slayer of hostile heroes, however, forcibly<br>catching hold of his legs, stopped Hrishikesa with great difficulty at<br>the tenth step. Then Arjuna his dear friend, filled with sorrow,<br>affectionately addressed Kesava, who was then sighing like a snake and<br>whose eyes were troubled in wrath, saying, 'O thou of mighty arms, stop,<br>O Kesava, it behoveth thee not to make those words false which thou hadst<br>spoken before, viz., I will not fight. O Madhava, people will say that<br>thou art a liar. All this burden resteth upon me. I will slay the<br>grandsire. I swear, O Kesava, by my weapons, by truth, and my good deeds,<br>that, O slayer of foes, I will do all by which the destruction of my foes<br>may be achieved. Behold this very day that invincible and mighty<br>car-warrior in the act of being thrown down by me, with the greatest<br>ease, like the crescent moon at the end of the Yuga (when the destruction<br>of the universe comes). Madhava, however, hearing these words of the<br>high-souled Phalguni, spoke not a word, but in anger once more mounted<br>upon the car. And then upon those two tigers among men, when stationed on<br>their car, Bhishma the son of Santanu, once more poured his arrowy<br>showers like the clouds pouring rain upon the mountain-breast. Thy sire<br>Devavrata took the lives of the (hostile) warriors like the Sun sucking<br>with his rays the energies of all things during summer. As the Pandavas<br>had been breaking the ranks of the Kurus in battle, so thy sire broke the<br>Pandava ranks in battle. And the routed soldiers, helpless and heartless,<br>slaughtered in hundreds and thousands by Bhishma, were unable to even<br>look at him in that battle,&#8212;him who resembled the mid-day Sun blazing in<br>his own splendour. Indeed, the Pandavas afflicted with fear, timidly<br>gazed at Bhishma who was then achieving super-human feats in that battle.<br>And the Pandava troops, thus fleeing away, O Bharata, failed to find a<br>protector, like a herd of kine sunk in a shoal of ants while being trod<br>down by a strong person. Indeed, the Pandavas could not, O Bharata, look<br>at that mighty car-warrior incapable of being shaken, who, furnished with<br>a profusion of shafts, was scorching the kings (in the Pandava army), and<br>who in consequence of those shafts looked like the blazing Sun shedding<br>his fiery rays. And while he was thus grinding the Pandava army, the<br>thousand-rayed maker of day repaired to the setting hills, and the<br>troops, worn with fatigue, set their hearts on withdrawal (from the<br>field)."
