                            Sanjaya said, "Arjuna then, O king, beholding the prowess of Bhishma in<br>battle, addressed Sikhandin saying, 'Proceed towards the grandsire. Thou<br>shouldst not entertain the slightest fear of Bhishma today. Even I will<br>throw him down from his excellent car by means of my sharp shafts'. Thus<br>addressed by Partha, Sikhandin, O bull of Bharata's race, having heard<br>those words, rushed at the son of Ganga. And so Dhrishtadyumna also, O<br>king, and the mighty car-warrior Abhimanyu, having heard those words of<br>Partha, joyfully rushed at Bhishma. And old Virata and Drupada, and<br>Kuntibhoja also, clad in mail, rushed at Bhishma in the very sight of thy<br>son. And Nakula, Sahadeva, and the valiant king Yudhishthira also, and<br>all the rest of the warriors, O monarch, rushed against Bhishma. As<br>regards thy warriors O king, that rushed, according to the measure of<br>their might and courage, against those mighty car-warriors (of the<br>Pandava army) united together, listen to me as I speak (of them) unto<br>thee. Like a young tiger attacking a bull, Chitrasena, O king, rushed<br>against Chekitana who in that battle was proceeding for getting at<br>Bhishma. Kritavarman, O king, resisted Dhrishtadyumna who had reached the<br>presence of Bhishma and who was exerting himself with great activity and<br>vigour in that battle. Somadatta's son, O monarch, with great activity,<br>resisted Bhimasena excited with fury and desirous of slaying Bhishma.<br>Similarly Vikarna, desirous of (protecting) Bhishma's life, resisted the<br>brave Nakula who was scattering innumerable arrows around. And so, O<br>king, Kripa the son of Saradwat, excited with rage, resisted Sahadeva<br>proceeding towards Bhishma's car. And the mighty Durmukha rushed at that<br>Rakshasa of cruel deeds, viz., the mighty son of Bhishmasena, desirous of<br>Bhishma's slaughter. Thy son Duryodhana himself resisted Satyaki<br>proceeding to battle. Sudakshina the ruler of the Kamavojas, O king,<br>resisted Abhimanyu, O monarch, who was proceeding towards Bhishma's car.<br>And Aswatthaman, O king, excited with rage, resisted old Virata and<br>Drupada, those two chastisers of foes united together. And Bharadwaja's<br>son, exerting himself with vigour in battle, resisted the eldest Pandava,<br>that is to say, king Yudhishthira the just, who was desirous of Bhishma's<br>death. And that great bowman, viz., Dussasana, in that battle, resisted<br>Arjuna who was rushing with great speed, with Sikhandin before him,<br>desirous of coming upon Bhishma, O monarch, and illuminating the ten<br>quarters (with his bright weapons). And other warriors of thy army<br>resisted in that great battle other mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas<br>proceeding against Bhishma. Dhrishtadyumna, that mighty car-warrior,<br>excited with rage, rushed against Bhishma alone and addressing the<br>troops, repeatedly said in a loud voice, 'There, Arjuna, that delighter<br>of Kuru's race, is proceeding against Bhishma in battle. Rush ye against<br>Ganga's son. Be not afraid. Bhishma will not be able to attack you in<br>battle.[476] Vasava himself cannot venture to fight with Arjuna in<br>battle. What therefore, need be said of Bhishma who, though possessed of<br>bravery in battle, is feeble and old." Hearing these words of their<br>commander, the mighty car-warriors of the Pandava army, filled with joy,<br>rushed towards the car of Ganga's son. Many foremost of men, however, of<br>thy army cheerfully received and resisted those heroes coming towards<br>Bhishma like impetuous mass of living energy. That mighty car-warrior,<br>Dussasana, abandoning all fears, rushed against Dhananjaya, desirous of<br>protecting the life of Bhishma. And so the heroic Pandavas also, O king,<br>rushed in. battle against thy sons, those mighty car-warriors, stationed<br>about Bhishma's car. And then, O king we beheld a highly wonderful<br>incident, viz., that Partha, having proceeded as far as Dussasana's car,<br>could not advance further. As the continent resists the surging sea, even<br>so did thy son (Dussasana) resist the angry son of Pandu. Both of them<br>were foremost of car-warriors. Both of them, O Bharata, were invincible.<br>Both of them, in beauty and splendour, O Bharata, resembled the Sun or<br>the Moon. Both of them were excited with wrath. And each of them desired<br>to slay the other. And they encountered each other in dreadful battle<br>like Maya and Sakra in days of old. And Dussasana, O king, in that battle<br>pierced the son of Pandu with three shafts and Vasudeva with twenty. Then<br>Arjuna, excited with rage upon beholding him of Vrishni's race thus<br>afflicted, pierced Dussasana with a hundred shafts. These, penetrating<br>through the latter's armour, drank his blood in that battle. Then<br>Dussasana, excited with wrath, pierced Partha with five shafts. And once<br>more, O chief of the Bharatas, he pierced Arjuna in the forehead with<br>three sharp shafts. And with those shafts sticking to his forehead, the<br>son of Pandu looked beautiful in that battle, like Meru, O king with its<br>tall crests. That great bowman, viz., Partha, then thus deeply pierced by<br>thy son wielding the bow, looked resplendent in that battle like a<br>flowering Kinsuka. The son of Pandu then, excited with rage, afflicted<br>Dussasana, like Rahu inflamed with rage on the fifteenth day of the<br>lighted fortnight afflicting the Moon at full. Thus afflicted by that<br>mighty warrior, thy son, O king, pierced Partha in that battle with many<br>shafts whetted on stone and winged with the features of the Kanka bird.<br>Then Partha, cutting off Dussasana's bow and splitting his car with three<br>shafts, sped at him many fierce arrows resembling the darts of Death. Thy<br>son, however, cut off all those shafts of Partha exerting himself with<br>vigour before they could reach him. All this seemed highly wonderful.<br>Then thy son pierced Partha with many shafts of great sharpness. Then<br>Partha, excited with rage in that battle, placed on his bowstring a<br>number of shafts whetted on stone and furnished with wings of gold and<br>aiming them, sped them all at his foe. These, O king, penetrated the body<br>of that high-souled warrior, like swans, O monarch, diving into a lake.<br>Thus afflicted by the high-souled son of Pandu, thy son avoiding Partha,<br>quickly proceeded to the car of Bhishma. Indeed, Bhishma then became an<br>island unto him who was thus sinking into fathomless waters. Regaining<br>consciousness then, thy son, O monarch, endued with heroism and prowess,<br>once more began to resist Partha with sharp arrows like Purandara<br>resisting (the Asura) Vritra. Of huge form, thy son began to pierce<br>Arjuna, but the latter was scarcely pained (at all this)."
