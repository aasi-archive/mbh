                            Sanjaya said, "Then when the sun attained the meridian, king<br>Yudhishthira, beholding Srutayush, urged on his steeds. And the king<br>rushed at Srutayush, that chastiser of foes, striking him with nine<br>straight shafts of keen points. That great bowman, viz., king Srutayush<br>then, checking in that battle those arrows shot by the son of Pandu,<br>struck Yudhishthira with seven shafts. These penetrating through his<br>armour, drank his blood in that battle, as if sucking the very vital<br>energies dwelling in the body of that high-souled one.[418] The son of<br>Pandu then, though deeply pierced by that high-souled king, pierced king<br>Srutayush (in return), at the latter's heart, with an arrow shaped as the<br>boar's ear. And that foremost of car-warriors, viz., the son of Pritha,<br>with another broad-headed arrow, quickly felled on the earth the standard<br>of the high-souled Srutayush from his car. Beholding his standard<br>overthrown, king Srutayush then, O monarch, pierced the son of Pandu with<br>seven sharp shafts. Thereupon Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, blazed up<br>with wrath, like the fire that blazeth forth at the end of the Yuga for<br>consuming creatures. Beholding the son of Pandu excited with rage, the<br>gods, the Gandharvas, and the Rakshasas, trembled, O king, and the<br>universe became agitated. And even this was the thought that arose in the<br>minds of all creatures, viz., that that king, excited with rage, would<br>that day consume the three worlds. Indeed, when the son of Pandu was thus<br>excited with wrath, the Rishis and the celestials prayed for the peace of<br>the world. Filled with wrath and frequently licking the corners of his<br>mouth, Yudhishthira assumed a terrible expression looking like the sun<br>that riseth at the end of the Yuga. Then all thy warriors, O king, became<br>hopeless of their lives, O Bharata. Checking, however, that wrath with<br>patience, that great bowman endued with high renown then cut off<br>Srutayush's bow at the grasp. And then, in the very sight of all the<br>troops, the king in that battle pierced Srutayush whose bow had been cut<br>off, with a long arrow in the centre of the chest. And the mighty<br>Yudhishthira then, O king, speedily slew with his arrows the steeds of<br>Srutayush and then, without losing a moment, his charioteer. Beholding<br>the prowess of the king, Srutayush leaving that car whose steeds had been<br>slain, quickly fled away from battle. After that great bowman had been<br>vanquished in combat by the son of Dharma, all the troops of Duryodhana,<br>O king, turned their faces. Having, O monarch, achieved this feat,<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, began to slay thy troops like Death<br>himself with wide-open mouth.<br><br>"Chekitana of the Vrishni race, in the very sight of all the troops,<br>covered with his shafts Gautama, that foremost of car-warriors. Baffling<br>all those arrows, Kripa the son of Saradwat, pierced Chekitana in return<br>who was fighting with great care, O king, with arrows in that battle.<br>Then, O Bharata, with another broad-headed arrow he cut off Chekitana's<br>bow, and endued with great lightness of hand, he also felled with another<br>broad-headed arrow the former's charioteer. Kripa then, O monarch, slew<br>Chekitana's steeds, as also both the warriors that protected the latter's<br>wings. Then Chekitana of the Satwata race, quickly jumped down from his<br>car, and took up a mace. The foremost of all wielders of the mace,<br>Chekitana, with that hero-slaying mace of his, slew the steeds of Gautama<br>and then felled his charioteer. Then Gautama, standing on the ground,<br>shot sixteen arrows at Chekitana. Those arrows, piercing through that<br>hero of the Satwata race, entered the earth. Thereat, Chekitana excited<br>with rage, once more hurled his mace, desirous of slaying Gautama, like<br>Purandara desirous of slaying Vritra. Then Gautama with many thousands of<br>arrows checked that huge mace, endued with the strength of adamant, that<br>was coursing towards him. Then Chekitana, O Bharata, drawing his sabre<br>from the sheath, rushed with great speed towards Gautama. Thereupon<br>Gautama also, throwing away his bow, and taking up a polished sabre,<br>rushed with great speed towards Chekitana. Both of them possessed of<br>great strength, and both armed with excellent sabres, began to strike<br>each other with those sharp-edged weapons of theirs. Then those bulls<br>among men, struck with the force of each other's sabres, fell down on the<br>earth, that (common) element of all creatures. Exhausted by the efforts<br>they had made, the limbs of both were motionless in a swoon. Then<br>Karakarsha impelled by friendship, quickly rushed to that spot. And that<br>invincible warrior, beholding Chekitana in that plight, took him up on<br>his car in the very sight of all troops. And so also the brave Sakuni,<br>thy brother-in-law, O monarch, speedily caused Gautama, that foremost of<br>car-warriors, to mount on his car.<br><br>"The mighty Dhrishtaketu, excited with wrath, speedily pierced the son of<br>Somadatta, O king, with ninety shafts in the chest. And the son of<br>Somadatta looked highly resplendent with those shafts on his chest, like<br>the sun, O king, with his rays at mid-day. Bhurisravas, however, in that<br>battle, with his excellent shafts, deprived Dhrishtaketu, that mighty<br>car-warrior, of his car, slaying his charioteer and steeds. And beholding<br>him deprived of his car, and his steeds and charioteer slain, Bhurisravas<br>covered Dhrishtaketu in that combat with a thick shower of arrows. The<br>high-souled Dhrishtaketu then. O sire, abandoning that car of his,<br>mounted upon the vehicle of Satanika. Chitrasena, and Vikarna, O king,<br>and also Durmarshana,&#8212;these car-warriors cased in golden mail,&#8212;all<br>rushed against the son of Subhadra. Then a fierce battle took place<br>between Abhimanyu and those warriors, like the battle of the body, O<br>king, with wind, bile, and phlegm.[419] That tiger among men, however,<br>(viz., Abhimanyu), having, O king, deprived thy sons of their cars, slew<br>them not, remembering Bhima's words.[420] Then during the progress of the<br>fight, Kunti's son (Arjuna), of white steeds, beholding Bhishma, who was<br>incapable of being vanquished by very gods, proceeding to rescue thy sons<br>in view of Abhimanyu&#8212;a boy and alone though a mighty car-warrior,<br>addressed Vasudeva and said these words, 'Urge the steeds, O Hrishikesa,<br>to that spot where are those numerous car-warriors. They are many in<br>number, brave, accomplished in arms, invincible in battle. Guide the<br>horses so, O Madhava, that the foe may not be able to slay our troops.'<br>Thus urged by Kunti's son of immeasurable energy, he of Vrishni's race<br>then drove that car, unto which were yoked white steeds, to battle. When<br>Arjuna, excited with rage, thus proceeded towards thy army, a loud<br>uproar, O sire, arose among thy troops.[421] The son of Kunti then,<br>having come up to those kings that were protecting Bhishma, (first)<br>addressed Susarman, O king, and said these words, 'I know thee to be<br>foremost in battle, and a dire enemy (of ours) of old. Behold to-day the<br>terrible fruit of that evil behaviour (of thine).[422] I will today cause<br>thee to visit the manes of thy ancestors.' That leader of car-divisions,<br>Susarman, however, hearing these harsh words uttered by that slayer of<br>foes viz., Vibhatsu, told him nothing (in reply), well or ill. (But)<br>approaching the heroic Arjuna, with a large number of kings in his train,<br>and surrounding him in that battle, he covered him aided by thy sons, O<br>sinless one, with arrows from all sides, viz., front, rear, and flanks,<br>like the clouds covering the maker of day. Then, O Bharata, a dreadful<br>battle took place between thy army and the Pandavas, in which blood ran<br>like water."
