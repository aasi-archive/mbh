                            Dhritarashtra said, 'Hearing of those feats of the sons of Pandu which<br>are incapable of being achieved by the gods themselves, my heart, O<br>Sanjaya, is filled with fear and wonder. Hearing also of the humiliation<br>of my sons in every way, great hath been my anxiety as to the consequence<br>that will ensue. The words uttered by Vidura will, no doubt, consume my<br>heart. Everything that hath happened seemeth to be due to Destiny, O<br>Sanjaya. The combatants of the Pandava army are encountering and smiting<br>those best of warriors having Bhishma for their head, those heroes<br>conversant with every weapon. What ascetic penances have been performed<br>by the high-souled and mighty sons of Pandu, what boon hath they<br>obtained, O son, or what science is known to them, in consequence of<br>which, like the stars in the firmament, they are undergoing no<br>diminution? I cannot bear it that my army should be repeatedly<br>slaughtered by the Pandavas. The divine chastisement, highly severe, both<br>fallen on me alone. Tell me everything truly, O Sanjaya, about that for<br>which the sons of Pandu have become unslayable and mine slayable. I do<br>not see the other shore of this (sea of) distress.[383] I am like a man<br>desirous of crossing the vastly deep ocean with my two arms alone. I<br>certainly think that a great calamity hath overtaken my sons. Without<br>doubt, Bhima will slay all my sons. I do not see that hero who is able to<br>protect my sons in battle. The death of my sons in this battle, O<br>Sanjaya, is certain. It behoveth thee, therefore, O Suta, to tell me, who<br>asketh thee, everything about the true cause of all these. Beholding his<br>own troops retreating from battle, what did Duryodhana do? And what old<br>Bhishma and Drona, and Kripa, and Suvala's son, and Jayadratha, and that<br>mighty bowman, viz., Drona's son and Vikarna of great strength do? When<br>also, O thou of great wisdom, my sons turned back from the fight, what O<br>Sanjaya, became the resolve of those high-souled warriors?"<br><br>Sanjaya said, "Listen, O king, with attention, and having listened, let<br>it go to thy heart. Nothing (in this) is the result of incantation,<br>nothing the result of illusion of any king. Nor have the sons of Pandu<br>created any new terrors. They are endued with might; and they are<br>fighting by fair means in this battle. Desirous of high fame, the sons of<br>Pritha always do every act, including even the support of their lives,<br>agreeably to the way of morality. Endued with every kind of prosperity,<br>and possessed of great strength, they never desist from battle, keeping<br>their eyes on righteousness. And victory is there where righteousness is.<br>It is for this, O king, that the sons of Pritha are unslayable in battle<br>and always victorious. Thy sons are of wicked souls and are addicted to<br>sinfulness. They are cruel and wedded to mean acts. It is for this that<br>they are being weakened in battle. Thy sons, O king, like despicable men,<br>did many cruel and deceitful acts to the sons of Pandu. Disregarding,<br>however, all those offences of thy sons, the sons of Pandu always<br>concealed those acts, O elder brother of Pandu. Thy sons also, O king, on<br>numerous occasions humiliated the Pandavas. Let them now reap the<br>terrible fruit, like poison, of that persistent course of<br>sinfulness.[384] That fruit should be enjoyed by thee also, O king, with<br>thy sons and kinsmen, since thou, O king, could not be awakened even<br>though counselled by thy well-wishers. Repeatedly forbidden by Vidura, by<br>Bhishma, by the high-souled Drona, and by myself also thou didst not<br>understand, rejecting our words intended for thy good and worthy of thy<br>acceptance, like a sick man rejecting the medicine prescribed. Accepting<br>the views of thy sons thou hadst regarded the Pandavas as already<br>vanquished. Listen again, O king, to what thou hast asked me, viz., the<br>true cause, O chief of the Bharatas, of the victory of the Pandavas. I<br>will tell thee whit I have heard, O chastiser of foes. Duryodhana had<br>asked the grandsire this very question. Beholding his brothers, all<br>mighty car-warriors, vanquished in battle, thy son Duryodhana, O Kaurava,<br>with heart confounded with grief, repairing with humility during the<br>night to the grandsire possessed of great wisdom, asked him this<br>question. Listen to me, O monarch, about it all.<br><br>"Duryodhana said, 'Drona and thou, and Salya, and Kripa, and Drona's son,<br>and Kritavarman the son of Hridika, and Sudakshina the ruler of the<br>Kamvojas, and Bhurisravas, and Vikarna, and Bhagadatta of exceeding<br>prowess, are all regarded as mighty car-warriors. All of these, again,<br>are high-born, and prepared to throw away their lives in battle. It is my<br>opinion that these are a match for even the three worlds (united<br>together). Even all the warriors of the Pandava army (united together)<br>cannot bear your prowess. A doubt has arisen in my mind. Explain it to me<br>who enquireth of thee. Who it is, relying on whom the Pandavas are<br>vanquishing us repeatedly.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O king, to the words that I will speak unto thee,<br>O thou of Kuru's race. Frequently wert thou addressed by me to the same<br>effect but thou didst not do what I said. Let peace be made with the<br>Pandavas, O best of the Bharatas. I regard this to be beneficial both to<br>the world and thee, O lord. Enjoy this earth, O king, with thy brothers<br>and be happy, gratifying all thy well-wishers and delighting thy<br>kinsfolk. Although I cried myself hoarse before this, thou didst not yet<br>listen to me, O sire. Thou hadst always disregarded the sons of Pandu.<br>The effect of all that hath now overtaken thee. Listen also, O king, from<br>me as I speak of it, O Lord, to the reason why the Pandavas, whose<br>achievements tire them not, are unslayable.[385] There is not, was not,<br>will not be, the being in all the worlds who would or will be able to<br>vanquish the sons of Pandu who are all protected by the wielder of<br>Saranga. Listen truly, O thou that art conversant with morality, to that<br>ancient history which was recited to me by sages of souls under control.<br>In days of yore, all the celestials and the Rishis, united together,<br>waited reverentially on the Grandsire upon the mountains of Gandhamadana.<br>And the Lord of all creatures, seated at his case in their midst, beheld<br>an excellent car stationed in the firmament, blazing with effulgence.<br>Having ascertained (everything about it) by meditation, joining his hands<br>with restrained heart, Brahman, with delighted soul, made his salutations<br>to the highest Divine Being. And the Rishis and the celestials, beholding<br>in the firmament (the form thus) displayed, all stood up with joined<br>hands, their eyes fixed on that wonder of wonders. Worshipping him duly,<br>Brahma, the foremost of all conversant with Brahman, the Creator of the<br>universe, acquainted with the highest morality, uttered these high words:<br>Thou art the Glory of the Universe for thy form. Thou art the Lord of the<br>Universe. O thou whose protection extendeth through the whole Universe, O<br>thou that hath the Universe for thy work, O thou that hath thy soul under<br>control, Thou art the Supreme Master of the Universe. Thou art Vasudeva.<br>Therefore, I seek refuge in Thee that art the soul of Yoga and the<br>highest Divinity. Victory to Thee that art the Supreme God of the<br>Universe. Victory to Thee that art ever employed in the good of the<br>worlds. Victory to Thee that art the Lord of Yoga. Thee that art<br>all-powerful. Victory to Thee that art prior, and subsequent to Yoga.<br>Having the lotus springing from thy navel, and having large expansive<br>eyes, victory to Thee that art Lord of Lords of the Universe. O Lord of<br>the Past, the Present, and the Future, victory to Thee that art the<br>embodiment of gentleness. Thee that art the sun of suns. O thou that art<br>the receptacle of untold attributes, victory to Thee that art the refuge<br>of all things. Thou art Narayana, thou art incapable of being understood,<br>victory to Thee that art the wielder of the bow called Saranga. Victory<br>to Thee that art endued with every attribute, O thou that hast the<br>Universe for thy form, O thou that art ever hale. O Lord of the Universe,<br>O thou of mighty arms, victory to Thee that art always ready for<br>benefitting the worlds. O great Snake, O huge Boar, O first Cause, O thou<br>of tawny locks, victory to Thee that art Almighty. O thou of yellow<br>robes, O Lord of the cardinal and the subsidiary points of the compass, O<br>thou that hast the Universe for thy abode, O thou that art Infinite, O<br>thou that hast no decay, O thou that art the Manifest, O thou that art<br>the Unmanifest, O thou that art the immeasurable Space, O thou that hast<br>all thy senses under control, O thou that always achievest what is good,<br>O thou that art immeasurable, O thou that alone knowest thy own nature,<br>victory to Thee that art deep, O thou that art the giver of all wishes, O<br>thou that art without end, O thou that art known as Brahma, O thou that<br>art Eternal, O thou that art the Creator of all creatures, O thou that<br>art ever successful, O thou whose acts always display wisdom, O thou that<br>art conversant with morality, O thou that givest victory, O thou of<br>mysterious Self, O thou that art the Soul of all Yoga, O thou that art<br>the Cause of everything that hath sprung into existence, O thou that art<br>the knowledge of the selves of all beings, O Lord of the worlds, victory<br>to thee that art the Creator of all beings. O thou that hath thyself for<br>thy origin, O thou that art highly blessed, O thou that art the Destroyer<br>of everything, O thou that art the inspirer of all mental thoughts,<br>victory to Thee that art dear to all conversant with Brahma. O thou that<br>art busy in creation and destruction, O controller of all wishes, O<br>Supreme Lord, O thou that art the Cause of Amrita, O thou that art<br>All-existent, O thou that art the first that appears at the end of the<br>Yuga, O thou that art the giver of victory, O Divine Lord of the Lord of<br>all creatures, O thou that hast the lotus springing from thy navel, O<br>thou of mighty strength, O thou that art sprung from Thyself, O thou that<br>art the great elements in their primeval state, O thou that art the soul<br>of all (religious) rites, victory to Thee that givest all. The goddess<br>Earth represents thy two feet, the cardinal and the subsidiary directions<br>thy arms, and the heavens thy head. I am thy form, the celestials<br>constitute thy limbs, and the Sun, the moon are thy two eyes. Ascetic<br>austerities and Truth born of morality and (religious) rites, constitute<br>thy strength. Fire is thy energy, the wind is thy breath, and the waters<br>have sprung from thy sweat. The twins Aswins constitute thy ears, and the<br>goddess Saraswati is thy tongue. The Vedas are thy Knowledge, and upon<br>thee resteth this Universe. O Lord of Yoga and Yogins, we do not know thy<br>extent, thy measure, thy energy, thy prowess, thy might, thy origin. O<br>God, O Vishnu, filled with devotion in thee, and depending upon thee with<br>vows and observances, we ever worship Thee as the highest Lord, the God<br>of gods. The Rishis, the gods, Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the Rakshasas,<br>the Pannagas, the Pisachas, human beings, beasts, birds, reptiles,&#8212;all<br>these were created by me on Earth through Thy grace. O thou having the<br>lotus springing from thy navel, O thou of large expansive eyes, O<br>Krishna, O Dispeller of all woe, Thou art the Refuge of all creatures,<br>and Thou art their Guide. Thou hast the Universe for thy mouth. Through<br>thy grace, O Lord of the gods, the gods are ever happy. Through thy grace<br>the Earth hath always been freed from terrors. Therefore, O thou of large<br>eyes, take birth in the race of Yadu.[386] For the sake of establishing<br>righteousness, for slaying the sons of Diti, and for upholding the<br>Universe, do what I have said, O Lord. O Vasudeva, that which is thy<br>supreme mystery, that, O Lord hath been sung by me through Thy grace.<br>Having created the divine Sankarshana out of thy own Self by Thyself,<br>thou didst then, O Krishna, create Thyself as Pradyumna born of thyself.<br>From Pradyumna thou didst then create Aniruddha who is known as the<br>eternal Vishnu. And it was Aniruddha who created me as Brahma, the<br>upholder of the Universe. Created out of Vasudeva's essence I have,<br>therefore, been created by thee. Dividing Thyself into portions, take<br>birth, O Lord, among human beings. And slaughtering the Asuras there for<br>happiness of all the worlds, and establishing righteousness, and winning<br>renown, Thou wilt again truly attain to Yoga. The regenerate Rishis on<br>Earth and the gods, O thou of infinite prowess, devoted to thee, sing of<br>thy wonderous Self under those names that belong to thee. O thou of<br>excellent arms, all classes of creatures rest on thee, having taken<br>refuge in Thee, thou giver of boons. The regenerate ones sing Thee as the<br>world's bridge, having no beginning, middle and end, and as possessed of<br>unlimited Yoga.'"
