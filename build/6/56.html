                            Sanjaya said,&#8212;"When the night having passed away, the dawn came,<br>Santanu's son Bhishma, that chastiser of foes, gave the order for the<br>(Kuru) army to prepare for battle. And the son of Santanu, the old Kuru<br>grandsire, desirous of victory to thy sons, formed that mighty array<br>known after the name of Garuda. And on the beak of that Garuda was thy<br>sire Devavrata himself. And its two eyes were Bharadwaja's son and<br>Kritavarman of Satwata's race. And those renowned warriors, Aswatthaman<br>and Kripa, supported by the Trigartas, the Matsyas, the Kekayas, and the<br>Vatadhanas, were in its head. And Bhurisravas and Sala, and Salya and<br>Bhagadatta, O sire, and the Madrakas, the Sindhu-Souviras, and they that<br>were called the Pancha-nodas, together with Jayadratha, were placed on<br>its neck. And on its back was king Duryodhana with all his followers. And<br>Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti, and the Kamvojas with the Sakas, and the<br>Surasenas, O sire, formed its tail, O great king. And the Magadhas and<br>the Kalingas, with all the tribes of the Daserakas, accoutred in mail,<br>formed the right wing of that array. And the Karushas, the Vikunjas, the<br>Mundas, and the Kaundivrishas, with Vrithadvala, were stationed on the<br>left wing. Then that chastiser of foes, Savyasachin, beholding the host<br>disposed in battle-array, aided by Dhrishtadyumna, disposed his troops in<br>counter-array. And in opposition to that array of thine, the son of Pandu<br>formed fierce array after the form of the half-moon. And stationed on the<br>right horn, Bhimasena shone surrounded by kings of diverse countries<br>abundantly armed with various weapons. Next to him were those mighty<br>car-warriors Virata and Drupada; and next to them was Nila armed with<br>envenomed weapons. And next to Nila was the mighty car-warrior<br>Dhrishtaketu, surrounded by the Chedis, the Kasis, the Karushas, and the<br>Pauravas. And Dhrishtadyumna, and Sikhandin, with the Panchalas and the<br>Prabhadrakas, and supported by other troops, were stationed in the<br>middle, O Bharata, for battle. And thither also was king Yudhishthira the<br>just, surrounded by his elephant division. And next to him were Satyaki,<br>O king, and the five sons of Draupadi. And immediately next to them was<br>Iravan. And next to him were Bhimasena's son (Ghatotkacha) and those<br>mighty car-warriors, the Kekayas. And next, on the left horn (of that<br>array), was that best of men, viz., he who had for his protector,<br>Janardana&#8212;that protector of the whole Universe. It was thus that the<br>Pandavas formed their mighty counter-array for the destruction of thy<br>sons and of those who had sided with them. Then commenced the battle<br>between thy troops and those of the foe striking one another, and in<br>which cars and elephants mingled in the clash of combat. Large numbers of<br>elephants and crowds of cars were seen everywhere, O king, to rush<br>towards one another for purposes of slaughter. And the rattle of<br>innumerable cars rushing (to join the fray), or engaged separately raised<br>a loud uproar, mingling with the beat of drums. And the shouts of the<br>heroic combatants belonging to thy army and theirs, O Bharata, slaying<br>one another in that fierce encounter, reached the very heavens."
