                            Sanjaya said, "Then king Duryodhana, regaining his senses, once more<br>began to resist Bhima with showers of arrows. And once more those mighty<br>car-warriors viz., thy sons, united together, began to fight valiantly<br>with Bhimasena. And Bhimasena also of mighty arms during that battle,<br>having got his car, ascended it and proceeded to the spot where thy sons<br>were. And taking up a strong and very tough bow adorned with gold and<br>capable of taking the lives of foes he pierced thy sons in that conflict,<br>with his shafts. Then king Duryodhana struck the mighty Bhimasena at the<br>very vitals with a long shaft of exceeding sharpness. Then that mighty<br>bowman, pierced thus deeply by thy son, bow in hand, forcibly drawing his<br>own with eyes red in wrath, struck Duryodhana in his two arms and the<br>breast with three shafts. But struck thus, O king, he moved not, like a<br>prince of mountains. Beholding then those two heroes excited with rage<br>and smiting each other, the younger brothers of Duryodhana, all of whom<br>were heroes prepared to lay down their lives, remembering their<br>previously formed scheme of afflicting Vrikodara of terrible deeds, set<br>about firmly resolved, for smiting him down. And as they fell upon him in<br>battle, Bhimasena of great strength rushed against them, O king, like an<br>elephant rushing against an attacking compeer. Excited with fury and<br>endued with great energy, that celebrated hero then, O king, afflicted<br>thy son Chitrasena with a long arrow. And as regards thy other sons, that<br>descendant of Bharata smote them all in that battle, with diverse kinds<br>of shafts furnished with wings of gold and endued with great impetus.<br>Then king Yudhishthira the just, disposing all his own divisions properly<br>despatched twelve mighty car-warriors including Abhimanyu and others to<br>follow Bhimasena behind. Those, O king, all proceeded against those<br>mighty car-warriors, viz., thy sons. Beholding those heroes on their<br>cars, resembling the Sun himself or the fire in splendour-those great<br>bowmen of blazing effulgence and superb beauty, looking resplendent in<br>that dreadful conflict with ornaments of gold,&#8212;thy mighty sons abandoned<br>Bhima (with whom they had been fighting). The sons of Kunti, however,<br>could not bear the sight of their abandoning the conflict alive."
