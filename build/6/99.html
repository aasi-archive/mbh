                            Sanjaya said, "The high-souled Bhishma, deeply pierced with wordy daggers<br>by thy son, became filled with great grief. But he said not a single<br>disagreeable word in reply. Indeed, mangled by those wordy daggers and<br>filled with grief and rage, he sighed like a snake and reflected (in<br>silence) for a long while. Raising his eyes then, and as if consuming,<br>from wrath, the world with the celestials, the Asuras, and the<br>Gandharvas, that foremost of persons conversant with the world, then<br>addressed thy son and said unto him these tranquil words, 'Why, O<br>Duryodhana, dost thou pierce me thus with thy wordy daggers? I always<br>endeavour to the utmost of my might to achieve, and do achieve, what is<br>for thy good. Indeed, from desire of doing what is agreeable to thee, I<br>am prepared to cast away my life in battle. The Pandavas are really<br>invincible. When the brave son of Pandu gratified Agni in the forest of<br>Khandava, having vanquished Sakra himself in battle, even that is a<br>sufficient indication.[462] When, O mighty-armed one, the same son of<br>Pandu rescued thee while thou wert being led away a captive by the<br>Gandharvas, even that is a sufficient indication. On that occasion, O<br>lord, thy brave uterine brothers had all fled, as also Radha's son of the<br>Suta caste. That (rescue, therefore, by Arjuna) is a sufficient<br>indication. In Virata's city, alone he fell upon all of us united<br>together. That is a sufficient indication. Vanquishing in battle both<br>Drona and myself excited with rage, he took away our robes. That is a<br>sufficient indication. On that occasion, of old, of the seizure of kine,<br>he vanquished that mighty bowman the son of Drona, and Saradwat also.<br>That is a sufficient indication. Having vanquished Karna also who is very<br>boastful of his manliness, he gave the latter's robes unto Uttara. That<br>is a sufficient indication. The son of Pritha defeated in battle the<br>Nivatakavachas who were incapable of defeat by Vasava himself. That is a<br>sufficient indication. Who, indeed, is capable of vanquishing in battle<br>the son of Pandu by force, him, viz., that hath for his protector the<br>Protector of the Universe armed with conch, discus, and mace? Vasudeva is<br>possessed of infinite power, and is the Destroyer of the Universe. He is<br>the highest Lord of all, the God of gods, the Supreme Soul and eternal.<br>He hath been variously described, O king, by Narada and other great<br>Rishis. In consequence of thy folly, however, O Suyodhana, thou knowest<br>not what should be said and what should not. The man on the point of<br>death beholdeth all trees to be made of gold. So thou also, O son of<br>Gandhari, seest everything inverted. Having provoked fierce hostilities<br>with the Pandavas and the Srinjayas, fight now (thyself) with them in<br>battle. Let us see thee act like a man. As regards myself, I will, O<br>tiger among men, slay all the Somakas and the Panchalas assembled<br>together, avoiding Sikhandin alone. Slain by them in battle, I will go to<br>Yama's abode, or slaying them in battle, I will give thee joy. Sikhandin<br>was born in Drupada's palace as female at first. She became a male in<br>consequence of the grant of a boon. After all, however, she is<br>Sikhandini. Him I will not slay even if I have to lose my life, O<br>Bharata. She is the same Sikhandini that the Creator had first made her.<br>Pass the night in happy sleep, O son of Gandhari. Tomorrow I will fight a<br>fierce battle about which men will speak as long as the world lasts.'<br>Thus addressed by him, thy son, O monarch, came away. And saluting his<br>signior with a bow of the head, he came back to his own tent. Coming<br>back, the king dismissed his attendants. And soon then that destroyer of<br>foes entered his abode. And having entered (his tent) the monarch passed<br>the night (in. sleep). And when the night dawned, rising up, the king,<br>ordered all the royal warriors, saying, Draw up the forces. Today<br>Bhishma, excited with wrath, will slay all the Somakas.'<br><br>Hearing those copious lamentations of Duryodhana in the night, Bhishma<br>regarded them, O king, as commands to himself. Filled with great grief<br>and deprecating the status of servitude, Santanu's son reflected for a<br>long time, thinking of an encounter with Arjuna in battle. Understanding<br>from signs that Ganga's son had been thinking of that, Duryodhana, O<br>king, commanding Dussasana, saying, 'O Dussasana, let cars be quickly<br>appointed for protecting Bhishma. Let all the two and twenty divisions<br>(of our army) be urged on. That hath now come about which we had been<br>thinking for a series of years, viz., the slaughter of the Pandavas with<br>all their troops and the acquisition (by ourselves) of the kingdom. In<br>this matter, I think, the protection of Bhishma is our foremost duty.<br>Protected by us, he will protect us and slay the Parthas in battle. Of<br>cleansed soul, he said unto me,&#8212;I will not slay Sikhandini. He was a<br>female before, O king, and, therefore, should be avoided by me in battle.<br>The world knoweth, O thou of mighty arms, that from desire of doing good<br>to my father, I formerly gave up a swelling kingdom. I will not,<br>therefore, slay in battle, O foremost of men, any female or anybody that<br>was a female before. This that I tell thee is true. This Sikhandin, O<br>king, was first born a female. Thou hast heard that story. She was born<br>as Sikhandini after the manner I told thee before the battle began.<br>Taking her birth as a daughter she hath become a man. Indeed, she will<br>fight with me, but I will never shoot my arrows at her. As regards all<br>other Kshatriyas desirous of victory to the Pandavas, O sire, whom I may<br>get within my reach on the field of battle, I will slay them.&#8212;These were<br>the words that Ganga's son acquainted with the scriptures, that chief of<br>Bharata's race, said unto me. Therefore, with my whole soul I think that<br>protecting the son of Ganga is our foremost duty. The very wolf may slay<br>the lion left unprotected in the great forest. Let not Ganga's son be<br>slain by Sikhandin like the lion slain by the wolf. Let our maternal<br>uncle Sakuni, and Salya, and Kripa, and Drona, and Vivingsati, carefully<br>protect the son of Ganga. If he is protected, (our) victory is certain.'<br><br>"Hearing these words of Duryodhana, all surrounded Ganga's son with a<br>large division of cars. And thy sons also, taking up their position<br>around Bhishma, proceeded to battle. And they all went, shaking the earth<br>and the welkin, and causing fear in the hearts of the Pandavas. The<br>mighty car-warriors (of the Kaurava army), supported by those cars and<br>elephants, and clad in mail, stood in battle, surrounding Bhishma. And<br>all of them took up their positions for protecting that mighty<br>car-warrior like the celestials in the battle between themselves and the<br>Asuras for protecting the wielder of the thunder-bolt. Then king<br>Duryodhana once more addressing his brother, said, 'Yudhamanyu protects<br>the left wheel of Arjuna's car, and Uttamaujas his right wheel. And (thus<br>protected) Arjuna protects Sikhandin. O Dussasana, adopt such steps that,<br>protected by Partha, Sikhandin may not be able to slay Bhishma left<br>unprotected by us.' Hearing these words of his brother, thy son<br>Dussasana, accompanied by the troops, advanced for battle, placing<br>Bhishma in the van. Beholding Bhishma (thus surrounded by a large number<br>of cars), Arjuna, that foremost of car-warriors, addressed Dhrishtadyumna<br>and said, 'O prince, place that tiger among men, Sikhandin, today in<br>front of Bhishma, I myself will be his protector, O prince of Panchala."
