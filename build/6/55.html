                            Sanjaya said, "When the forenoon of that day had passed away, O Bharata,<br>and when the destruction of cars, elephants, steeds, foot-soldiers and<br>horse-soldiers, proceeded on, the prince of Panchala engaged himself in<br>battle with these three mighty car-warriors, viz., Drona's son, Salya,<br>and the high-souled Kripa. And the mighty heir of Panchala's king with<br>many sharp shafts, slew the steeds of Drona's son that were celebrated<br>over all the world. Deprived then of his animals, Drona's son quickly<br>getting up on Salya's car, showered his shafts on the hair of the<br>Panchala king. And beholding Dhrishtadyumna engaged in battle with<br>Drona's son, the son of Subhadra, O Bharata, quickly came up scattering<br>his sharp arrows. And, O bull of Bharata's race, he pierced Salya with<br>five and twenty, and Kripa with nine arrows, and Aswatthaman with eight.<br>Drona's son, however, quickly pierced Arjuna's son with many winged<br>arrows, and Salya pierced him with twelve, and Kripa with three sharp<br>arrows. Thy grandson Lakshmana then, beholding Subhadra's son engaged in<br>battle, rushed at him, excited with rage. And the battle commenced<br>between them. And the son of Duryodhana, excited with rage, pierced<br>Subhadra's son with sharp shafts in that combat. And that (feat), O king,<br>seemed highly wonderful. The light-handed Abhimanyu then, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, excited with rage, quickly pierced his cousin with five<br>hundred arrows. Lakshmana also, with his shafts, then cut off his<br>(cousin's) bow-staff at the middle, at which, O monarch, all the people<br>sent forth a loud shout. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, the son of<br>Subhadra, leaving aside that broken bow, took up another that was<br>beautiful and tougher.[367] And thereupon those two bulls among men, thus<br>engaged in combat and desirous of counteracting each other's feats,<br>pierced each other with sharp shafts. King Duryodhana then, O monarch,<br>beholding his mighty son thus afflicted by thy grandson (Abhimanyu),<br>proceeded to that spot. And when thy son turned (towards that spot), all<br>the kings surrounded the son of Arjuna on every side with crowds of cars.<br>Incapable of being defeated in battle and equal in prowess unto Krishna<br>himself, that hero, O king, thus surrounded by those heroes, was not<br>agitated in the least. Then Dhananjaya, beholding Subhadra's son engaged<br>in battle, rushed to that spot, excited with wrath, desirous of rescuing<br>his own son. Thereupon the kings (on the Kuru side), headed by Bhishma<br>and Drona and with cars, elephants and steeds, rushed impetuously at<br>Savyasachin. Then a thick earthly dust, suddenly raised by foot-soldiers<br>and steeds and cars and cavalry troopers, covering the sky appeared on<br>the view. And those thousands of elephants and hundreds of kings, when<br>they came within reach of Arjuna's arrows, were all unable to make any<br>further advance. And all creatures there set up loud wails, and the<br>points of the compass became dark. And then the transgression of the<br>Kurus assumed a fierce and dreadful aspect as regards its consequences.<br>Neither the welkin, nor the cardinal points of the compass nor the earth,<br>nor the sun, could be distinguished, O best of men, in consequence of the<br>arrows shot by Kiritin.[368] And many were the elephants there deprived<br>of the standards (on their backs), and many car-warriors also, deprived<br>of their steeds. And some leaders of car divisions were seen wandering,<br>having abandoned their cars. And other car-warriors, deprived of their<br>cars, were seen to wander hither and thither, weapon in hand and their<br>arms graced with Angadas. And riders of steeds abandoning their steeds<br>and of elephants abandoning their elephants from fear of Arjuna, O king,<br>fled away in all directions. And kings were seen felled or falling from<br>cars and elephants and steeds in consequence of Arjuna's shafts. And<br>Arjuna, assuming a fierce countenance, cut off with his terrible shafts,<br>the upraised arms of warriors, mace in grasp, and arms bearing swords, O<br>king, or darts, or quivers, or shafts, or bows, or hooks, or standards,<br>all over the field. And spiked maces broken in fragments, and mallets, O<br>sire, and bearded darts, and short arrows, and swords also, in that<br>battle, and sharp-edged battle-axes, and lances, O Bharata, and shields<br>broken into pieces, and coats of mail also, O king,[369] and standards,<br>and weapons of all kinds thrown away and umbrellas furnished with golden<br>staves, and iron hooks also, O Bharata, and goads and whips, and traces<br>also, O sire, were seen strewn over the field of battle in heaps. There<br>was no man in thy army, O sire, who could advance against the heroic<br>Arjuna in battle. Whoever, O king, advanced against Pritha's son in<br>battle, pierced by sharp shafts was despatched to the other world. When<br>all these combatants of thine broke had fled away, Arjuna and Vasudeva<br>blew their excellent conches. Thy sire Devavrata then, beholding the<br>(Kuru) host routed, smilingly addressed the heroic son of Bharadwaja in<br>the battle and said, "This mighty and heroic son of Pandu, viz.,<br>Dhananjaya, accompanied by Krishna, is dealing with (our) troops as he<br>alone is competent to deal with them. He is incapable of being vanquished<br>in battle today by any means, judging by his form that we see now so like<br>unto that of the Destroyer himself at the end of the Yuga. This vast host<br>again (of ours) is incapable of being rallied. Behold, looking at one<br>another, our troops are flying away. Yon Sun, robbing in every way the<br>vision of the whole world, is about to reach that best of mountains<br>called Asta.[370] For this, O bull among men, I think that the hour is<br>come for the withdrawal (of the army). The warriors, who have all been<br>tired and struck with panic, will never fight. Having said this unto<br>Drona that best of preceptors, Bhishma, that mighty car-warrior, caused<br>thy army to be withdrawn. And then when the sun set, the withdrawal of<br>both thy army and theirs took place, O sire, and twilight set in."
