                            Dhritarashtra said, 'When the divisions of both my side and the foe were<br>thus arrayed, who struck first, the Kurus or the Pandavas?'<br><br>Sanjaya said, "Hearing those words of his (elder) brother, thy son<br>Dussasana advanced with his troops, with Bhishma at their head, and the<br>Pandavas also advanced with cheerful hearts, desiring battle with<br>Bhishma, having Bhimasena at their head. Then leonine, shouts, and<br>clamorous uproars and the noise of Krakachas, the blare of cow-horns, and<br>the sound of drums and cymbals and tabors, arose in both armies. And the<br>warriors of the foe rushed against us, and we also (rushed) against them<br>with loud shouts. And the uproar (caused by this rush) was<br>deafening.[317] The vast hosts of the Pandavas and the Dhartarashtras, in<br>that awfully murderous encounter shook in consequence of that uproar of<br>conches and cymbals, like forests shaken by the wind.[318] And the din<br>made by those hosts teeming with kings, elephants, and steeds, rushing<br>against one another in that evil hour, was as loud as that of oceans<br>agitated by the tempest. And when that din, loud and causing the hair to<br>stand on end, arose, the mighty-armed Bhimasena began to roar like a<br>bull. And those roars of Bhimasena rose above the clamour of conches and<br>drums, the grunts of elephants, and the leonine shouts of the combatants.<br>Indeed, the shouts of Bhimasena transcended the noise made by the<br>thousands of chargers neighing in (both) the armies. And hearing those<br>shouts of Bhimasena who was roaring like the clouds, shouts that<br>resembled the report of Sakra's thunder, thy warriors were filled with<br>fear. And at those roars of the hero, the steeds and elephants all<br>ejected urine and excreta like other animals at the roar of the lion. And<br>roaring like a deep mass of clouds, and assuming an awful form, that hero<br>frightened thy sons and fell upon them.[319] Thereupon the brothers,<br>viz., thy sons Duryodhana, and Durmukha and Dussaha, and that mighty<br>car-warrior Dussasana, and Durmarshana, O king, and Vivingsati, and<br>Chitrasena, and the great car-warrior Vikarna and also Purumitra, and<br>Jaya, and Bhoja, and the valorous son of Somadatta, shaking their<br>splendid bows like masses of clouds exhibiting the lightning's flashes,<br>and taking out (of their quivers) long arrows resembling snakes that have<br>just cast off their sloughs, surrounded that mighty bowman rushing<br>(towards them) covering him with flights of arrows like the clouds<br>shrouding the sun. And the (five) sons of Draupadi, and the mighty<br>car-warrior Saubhadra,[320] and Nakula, and Sahadeva, and Dhrishtadyumna<br>of Prishata's race, rushed against (those) Dhartarashtras, tearing them<br>with whetted shafts like summits of mountains with the impetuous bolts of<br>heaven. And in that first encounter characterised by the awful twang of<br>bow-strings and their flapping against the leathern fences (of the<br>warriors)[321] no combatant, either on thy side or that of the foe,<br>turned back. And, O bull of Bharata's race, I beheld the lightness of<br>hand of the disciples of Drona (in particular), who, shooting innumerable<br>arrows, O king, always succeeded in hitting the mark.[322] And the twang<br>of sounding bowstrings ceased not for a moment, and the blazing arrows<br>shot through (the air) like meteors (falling) from the firmament. And all<br>the other kings, O Bharata, stood like (silent) spectators witnessing<br>that interesting and awful encounter of kinsmen. And then those mighty<br>car-warriors, with wrath excited and remembering the injuries sustained<br>at one another's hands, strove in battle, O king, challenging one<br>another. And the two armies of the Kurus and the Pandavas, teeming with<br>elephants, steeds and cars, looked exceedingly beautiful on the field of<br>battle like painted figures on a canvas. And then the (other) kings all<br>took up their bows. And the Sun himself was shrouded by the dust raised<br>by the combatants. And they fell upon one another, at the heads of their<br>(respective) troops, at the command of thy son. And the loud uproar made<br>by the elephants and the chargers of those kings rushing to the combat,<br>mingled with the leonine shouts of the combatants and the din made by the<br>blare of conches and the sounds of drums. And the uproar of that ocean<br>having arrows for its crocodiles, bows for its snakes, swords for its<br>tortoises, and the forward leaps of the warriors for its tempest,<br>resembled the din made by the (actual) ocean when agitated. And kings in<br>thousands, commanded by Yudhishthira, with their (respective) troops fell<br>upon the ranks of thy son. And the encounter between the combatants of<br>the two hosts was fierce in the extreme. And no difference could be<br>perceived between the combatants of our side or that of the foe, while<br>battling, or retreating in broken array or rallying again to the fight.<br>In that terrific and awful battle, thy father (Bhishma) shone,<br>transcending that countless host.
