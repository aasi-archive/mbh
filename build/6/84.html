                            Dhritarashtra said, "Many and wonderful, O Sanjaya, were the single<br>combats I hear thee speak of between the Pandavas and my warriors. Thou<br>speakest not, however, O Sanjaya, of any one of my side having been<br>cheerful (on such occasions). Thou always speakest of the sons of Pandu<br>as cheerful and never routed, O Suta and thou speakest of mine as<br>cheerless, deprived of energy, and constantly vanquished in battle. All<br>this, without doubt, is Destiny."<br><br>Sanjaya said, "Thy men, O bull of Bharata's race, exert themselves<br>according to the measure of their might and courage, and display their<br>valour to the utmost extent of their strength. As contact with the<br>properties of the ocean make the sweet waters of the celestial stream<br>Ganga brakish, so the valour, O king, of the illustrious warriors of thy<br>army coming in contact with the heroic sons of Pandu in battle, becometh<br>futile. Exerting themselves according to their might, and achieving the<br>most difficult feats, thou shouldst not, O chief of the Kurus, find fault<br>with thy troops. O monarch, this great and awful destruction of the<br>world, swelling the (population of the) domains of Yama, hath arisen from<br>thy misconduct and that of thy sons. It behoveth thee not, O king, to<br>grieve for what hath arisen from thy own fault. Kings do not always in<br>this world protect their lives. These rulers of Earth, desirous of<br>winning by battle the regions of the righteous, daily fight, penetrating<br>into (hostile) divisions, with heaven only for their aim.<br><br>"On the forenoon of that day, O king, great was the carnage that ensued,<br>resembling what occurred in the battle between the gods and the Asuras<br>(of old). Listen to it, O monarch, with undivided attention. The two<br>princes of Avanti, those great bowmen endued with exceeding might, those<br>excellent warriors fierce in battle, beholding Iravat, advanced against<br>him. The battle that took place between them was fierce, making the hair<br>stand on end. Then Iravat, excited with rage, quickly pierced those two<br>brothers of celestial forms with many sharp and straight shafts. Those<br>two, however, conversant with all modes of warfare, pierced him in return<br>in that battle. Struggling their best to slaughter the foe, and desirous<br>of counteracting each other's feats, no distinction, O king, could be<br>observed between them as they fought. Iravat then, O monarch, with four<br>shafts, despatched the four steeds of Anuvinda to the abode of Yama. And<br>with a couple of sharp, broad-headed shafts, O sire, he cut off the bow<br>and standard also of Anuvinda. And this feat, O king, seemed highly<br>wonderful. Then Anuvinda, leaving his own car, mounted on the car of<br>Vinda. Taking up an excellent and strong bow capable of bearing a great<br>strain, Anuvinda, as also his brother Vinda, those foremost of<br>car-warriors hailing from Avanti, both stationed on the same car, quickly<br>shot many shafts at the high-souled Iravat. Shot by them, those shafts of<br>great impetuosity decked with gold, while coursing through the air,<br>covered the welkin.[414] Then Iravat, excited with rage, showered on<br>those mighty car-warriors, those two brothers (of Avanti) his arrowy<br>down-pours, and felled their charioteer. When the charioteer, deprived of<br>life, fell down on the ground, the horses, no longer restrained, ran away<br>with car. Having vanquished those two warriors, that daughter's son of<br>the king of the Nagas, displaying his prowess, then began to consume with<br>great activity thy ranks. Then that mighty Dhartarashtra host, while thus<br>slaughtered in battle, began to reel in many directions like a person who<br>hath drunk poison.<br><br>"That prince of Rakshasa, the mighty son of Hidimva, on his car of solar<br>effulgence furnished with a standard, rushed against Bhagadatta. The<br>ruler of the Pragjyotishas was stationed on his prince of elephants like<br>the wielder of the thunder-bolt in days of old in the battle occasioned<br>by the ravishment of Taraka. The gods, the Gandharvas, and the Rishis had<br>all come there. They could not, however, notice any distinction between<br>Hidimva's son and Bhagadatta. As the chief of the celestials, excited<br>with wrath, had inspired the Danavas with fear, so did Bhagadatta, O<br>king, frightened the Pandava warriors. And the warriors of the Pandava<br>army, frightened by him on all sides, failed, O Bharata, to find among<br>their ranks any protector. We beheld however, O Bharata, the son of<br>Bhimasena there, on his car. The other mighty car-warriors fled away with<br>cheerless hearts. When, however, O Bharata, he troops of the Pandavas<br>rallied, in the battle that then ensued an awful uproar arose among thy<br>troops. Then Ghatotkatcha, O king, in that dreadful battle, covered<br>Bhagadatta with his arrows like the clouds pouring rain on the breast of<br>Meru. Baffling all those arrows shot from the Rakshasa's bow, the king<br>quickly struck the son of Bhimasena in all his vital limbs. That prince<br>of the Rakshasa, however, though struck with innumerable straight shafts,<br>wavered not at all (but stood still) like a mountain pierced (with<br>shafts). Then the ruler of the Pragjyotishas, excited with wrath, hurled<br>in that combat fourteen lances, all of which, however, were cut off by<br>the Rakshasa. Cutting off by means of his sharp shafts those lances, the<br>mighty-armed Rakshasa pierced Bhagadatta with seventy shafts, each<br>resembling the thunder-bolt in force. Then the ruler of the<br>Pragjyotishas, laughing the while, O Bharata, despatched in that combat<br>the four steeds of the Rakshasa to Death's domain. The prince of the<br>Rakshasas, however, of great valour, staying on that car whose steeds had<br>been slain, hurled with great force a dart at the elephant of the ruler<br>of the Pragjyotishas. King Bhagadatta then cut off that swift dart<br>furnished with a staff of gold and coursing impetuously towards him into<br>three fragments, and thereupon it fell down on the ground. Beholding his<br>dart cut off, the son of Hidimva fled from fear like Namuchi, that<br>foremost of the Daityas, in days of old, from battle with Indra. Having<br>vanquished in battle that hero of great valour and renowned prowess, who,<br>O king, cannot be vanquished in battle by Yama himself or Varuna, king<br>Bhagadatta with his elephant began to crush down the troops of the<br>Pandavas like a wild elephant. O king, crushing as he treads the<br>lotus-stalks (in a lake).<br><br>"The ruler of the Madras engaged in battle with his sister's sons, the<br>twins. And the overwhelmed those sons of Pandu with clouds of arrows.<br>Then Sahadeva, beholding his maternal uncle, engaged in battle (with<br>him), covered him with arrows like the clouds covering the maker of day.<br>Covered with those clouds of arrows, the ruler of the Madras wore a<br>delighted expression, and the twins also felt great delight for the sake<br>of their mother.[415] Then Salya, that mighty car-warrior, smiting<br>effectively in that battle, despatched with four excellent shafts, O<br>king, the four steeds of Nakula to the abode of Yama. Nakula then, that<br>mighty car-warrior, quickly jumping down from that car whose steeds had<br>been slain, mounted upon the vehicle of his renowned brother. Stationed<br>then on the same car, those two heroes, both fierce in battle, and both<br>excited with rage, began to shroud the car of the ruler of Madras, (with<br>heir arrows), drawing their bows with great strength. But that tiger<br>among men, though thus covered by his sister's sons with innumerable<br>straight arrows shook not in the least (but stood immovable) like a hill.<br>Laughing the while, he smote them (in return) with showers of arrows.<br>Then Sahadeva of great prowess, O Bharata, excited with wrath, took up a<br>(powerful) shaft, and rushing at the ruler of the Madras, shot it at<br>him[416]. That shaft endued with the impetuosity of Garuda himself, shot<br>by him, pierced the ruler of the Madras through, and fell on the earth.<br>Thereupon that mighty car-warrior, deeply pierced and greatly pained, sat<br>down. O king, on the terrace of his car, and went into a swoon. Beholding<br>him (thus) afflicted by the twins, deprived of consciousness, and<br>prostrated (on his car), his charioteer bore him away on his vehicle over<br>the field. Seeing the car of the ruler of the Madras retreating (from<br>battle) the Dhartarashtras all became cheerless and thought it was all<br>over with him.[417] Then those mighty car-warriors, viz., the two sons of<br>Madri, having vanquished in battle their maternal uncle, cheerfully blew<br>their conches and uttered leonine roars. And then they rushed joyfully, O<br>king, towards thy forces like the gods Indra and Upendra, O monarch,<br>towards the Daitya host."
