                            Sanjaya said,&#8212;"O king, I will now describe to thee the combats of<br>hundreds and thousands of foot-soldiers. O Bharata, in utter<br>forgetfulness of all consideration due to others. There the son<br>recognised not the sire, the sire (recognised not) the son of his loins,<br>the brother (recognised not) the brother, the sister's son (recognised<br>not) the maternal uncle. The maternal uncle (recognised not) the sister's<br>son, the friend not the friend. The Pandavas and the Kurus fought as if<br>they were possessed by demons. Some tigers among men, fell with cars into<br>pieces. And the shafts of cars broke clashing against shafts, and the<br>spikes of car-yokes against spikes of car-yokes. And some (warriors)<br>united together encountered others that were united together, all<br>desirous of taking one another's life-And some cars, obstructed by cars,<br>were unable to move. And huge-bodied elephants with rent temples, falling<br>upon huge elephants, angrily tore one another in many places with their<br>tusks. Others, O king, encountering impetuous and huge ones of their<br>species with arched edifices and standards (on their backs) and trained<br>to the fight struck with their tusks, shrieked in great agony.[329]<br>Disciplined by training and urged on by pikes and hooks, elephants not in<br>rut rushed straight against those that were in rut.[330] And some huge<br>elephants, encountering compeers in rut, ran, uttering cries like those<br>of cranes, in all directions. And many huge elephants, well-trained, and<br>with juice trickling down from rent temples and mouth, mangle with<br>swords, lances, and arrows, and pierced in their vital parts, shrieked<br>aloud and falling down expired. And some, uttering frightful cries, ran<br>in all directions. The foot-soldiers that protected the elephants, endued<br>with broad chests, and capable of smiting effectually, with wrath<br>excited, and armed with pikes and bows, and bright battle-axes, and with<br>maces and clubs, and short arrows, and lances, and with shafts, and stout<br>bludgeons mounted with iron spikes and swords, well-grasped of the<br>brightest polish, ran hither and thither, O king, and seemed resolved to<br>take one another's life. And the sabres of brave combatants rushing<br>against one another steeped in human blood, seemed to shine brightly. And<br>the whiz of swords whirled and made to descend by heroic arms and falling<br>upon the vital parts (of the bodies) of foes, became very loud. And the<br>heart-ending wails of combatants in multitudinous hosts, crushed with<br>maces and clubs, and cut off with well-tempered swords, and pierced with<br>the tusks of elephants, and grained by tuskers, calling upon one another,<br>were heard, O Bharata, to resemble the wails of those that are doomed to<br>hell. And horsemen, on chargers of exceeding speed and furnished with<br>outstretched tails resembling (the Plumes of) swans, rushed against one<br>another. And hurled by them, long-bearded darts adorned with pure gold,<br>fleet, and polished, and sharp-pointed, fell like snakes.[331] And some<br>heroic horsemen, on coursers of speed, leaping high, cut off the heads of<br>car-warriors from their cars.[332] And (here and there) a car-warrior,<br>getting bodies of cavalry within shooting distance, slew many with<br>straight shafts furnished with heads. And many infuriate elephants<br>adorned with trapping of gold, and looking like newly-risen clouds,<br>throwing down steed, crushed them with their own legs. And some elephants<br>struck on their frontal globes and flanks, and mangled by means of<br>lances, shrieked aloud in great agony. And many huge elephants, in the<br>bewildering of the melee, crushing steeds with their riders, threw them<br>down. And some elephants, overthrowing with the points of their tusks,<br>steeds with their riders, wandered, crushing cars with their standards.<br>And some huge male elephants, from excess of energy and with the temporal<br>juice gushing down in large quantities, slew steeds along with their<br>riders by means of their trunks and legs. Fleet arrows polished and<br>sharp-pointed and resembling snakes fell upon the heads, the temples, the<br>flanks, and the limbs of elephants. And polished javelins of terrible<br>mien, and looking like large meteoric flashes, hurled by heroic arms,<br>felt hither and thither, O king, piercing through the bodies of men and<br>horses, and cutting through coats of mail. And many taking out their<br>polished sabres from sheaths made of the skins of leopards and tigers,<br>slew the combatants opposed to them in battle. And many warriors, though<br>themselves attacked and had the flanks of their bodies cut open, yet<br>angrily fell upon (their foes) with swords, shields and battle-axes. And<br>some elephants dragging down and overthrowing cars with their steeds by<br>means of their trunks, began to wander in all directions, guided by the<br>cries of those behind them. And hither and thither some pierced by<br>javelins, and some cut asunder by battle-axes, and some crushed by<br>elephants and others trod down by horses, and some cut by car-wheels, and<br>some by axes, loudly called upon their kinsmen, O king. And some called<br>upon their sons, and some upon their sires, and some upon brother and<br>kinsmen. And some called upon their maternal uncles, and some upon their<br>sister's sons. And some called upon others, on the field of battle. And a<br>very large number of combatants, O Bharata, lost their weapons, or had<br>their thighs broken. And other with arms torn off or sides pierced or cut<br>open, were seen to wail aloud, from desire of life. And some, endued with<br>little strength, tortured by thirst, O king, and lying on the field of<br>battle on the bare ground, asked for water. And some, weltering in pools<br>of blood and excessively weakened, O Bharata, greatly censured themselves<br>and thy sons assembled together for battle. And there were brave<br>Kshatriyas, who having injured one another, did not abandon their weapons<br>or set up any wails, O sire, On the other hand, lying in those places<br>where they lay, roared with joyful hearts, and biting from wrath with<br>their teeth their own lips, looked at one another with faces rendered<br>fierce in consequence of the contraction of their eyebrows. And others<br>endued with great strength and tenacity in great pain, afflicted by<br>arrows and smarting under their wounds, remained perfectly silent. And<br>other heroic car-warriors, deprived, in the encounter, of their own cars<br>and thrown down and wounded by huge elephants, asked to be taken up on<br>the cars of others. And many, O king, looked beautiful in their wounds<br>like blossoming Kinsukas. And in all the divisions were heard terrific<br>cries, countless in number. And in that awful combat destructive of<br>heroes, the sire slew the son, the son slew the sire, the sister's son<br>slew the maternal uncle, the maternal uncle slew the sister's son, friend<br>slew friend, and relatives slew kinsmen. Even thus the slaughter took<br>place in that encounter of the Kurus with the Pandavas. And in that<br>frightful and terrible battle in which no consideration was shown (by<br>anybody for anybody), the divisions of the Pandavas, approaching Bhishma,<br>began to waver. And, O bull of Bharata's race, the mighty-armed Bhishma,<br>O king, with his standard which was made of silver and graced with the<br>device of the palmyra with five stars, setting upon his great car, shone<br>like the lunar orb under the peak of Meru."
