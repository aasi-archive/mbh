                            Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;"I regard destiny to be superior to exertion, O<br>Sanjaya, inasmuch as the army of my son is continually slaughtered by the<br>army of the Pandavas. Thou always speakest, O suta, of my troops as being<br>slaughtered, and thou always speakest of the Pandavas as both unslain and<br>cheerful. Indeed, O Sanjaya, thou speakest of mine as deprived of<br>manliness, felled and falling, and slaughtered, although they are<br>battling to the best of their powers and striving hard for victory. Thou<br>always speakest to me of the Pandavas as obtaining victory and mine as<br>becoming weaker and weaker. O child, I am incessantly hearing of<br>countless cause of unbearable and poignant grief on account of<br>Duryodhana's doing. I do not see, O Sanjaya, the means by which the<br>Pandavas, may be weakened and sons of mine may obtain the victory in<br>battle.<br><br>Sanjaya said, "This mighty evil hath proceeded from thee, O king. Listen<br>now with patience to the great slaughter of men, elephants, steeds and<br>car-warriors. Dhrishtadyumna, afflicted by Salya with nine shafts,<br>afflicted in return the ruler of Madras with many shafts made of steel.<br>And then we beheld the prowess of Prishata's son to be highly wonderful<br>inasmuch as he speedily checked Salya that ornament of assemblies. The<br>battle between them lasted for only a short space of time. While angrily<br>engaged in combat, none beheld even a moment's rest taken by any of them.<br>Then, O king, Salya in that battle cut off Dhrishtadyumna's bow with a<br>broad-headed shaft of sharp edge and excellent temper. And he also<br>covered him, O Bharata, with a shower of arrows like rain charged clouds<br>pouring their drops on the mountain breast during the season of rains.<br>And while Dhrishtadyumna was being thus afflicted, Abhimanyu, excited<br>with wrath, rushed impetuously towards the car of the ruler of the<br>Madras. Then the wrathful son of Krishna, of immeasurable soul, obtaining<br>the car of the ruler of the Madras (within shooting distance), pierced<br>Artayani with three sharp shafts.[379] Then the warriors of thy army, O<br>king, desirous of opposing the son of Arjuna in battle, speedily<br>surrounded the car of the ruler of Madras. And Duryodhana, and Vikarna,<br>and Dussasana, and Vivinsati and Durmarshana, and Dussala, and<br>Chitrasena, and Durmukha, and Satyabrata, blessed be thou, and Purumitra,<br>O Bharata,&#8212;these, protecting the car of the ruler of the Madras,<br>stationed themselves there. Then Bhimasena, excited with wrath, and<br>Dhrishtadyumna. of Prishata's race, and the five sons of Draupadi, and<br>Abhimanyu, and the twin sons of Madri and Pandu,&#8212;these ten opposed those<br>ten warriors of the Dhritarashtra army shooting, O king, diverse kinds of<br>weapons. And they approached and encountered one another in battle<br>desirous of slaying one another, in consequence, O king, of thy wicked<br>policy. And when those ten car-warriors, excited with wrath, engaged with<br>the ten others in that awful battle, the other car-warriors of both thy<br>army and of the foe all stood as spectators. And those mighty<br>car-warriors, shooting diverse kinds of weapons and roaring at one<br>another, smote one another fiercely. With wrath engendered in their<br>breasts, desirous of slaying one another, they uttered fierce shouts,<br>challenging one another. And jealous of one another, O king, those<br>kinsfolk united together, encountered one another wrathfully, shooting<br>mighty weapons. And wonderful to say, Duryodhana, excited with rage,<br>pierced Dhrishtadyumna in that battle with four sharp shafts. And<br>Durmarshana pierced him with twenty, and Chitrasena with five, and<br>Durmukha with nine, and Dussaha with seven, and Vivinsati with five, and<br>Dussasana with three shafts. Then, O great king, that scorcher of foes,<br>viz., Prishata's son, pierced each of them in return with five and twenty<br>shafts, displaying his lightness of hand. And Abhimanyu, O Bharata,<br>pierced Satyavrata and Purumitra each with ten shafts. Then the son of<br>Madri, those delighters of their mother, covered their uncle with showers<br>of sharp arrows. And all this seemed wonderful. Then, O monarch, Salya<br>covered his nephews, those two foremost of car-warriors desirous of<br>counteracting their uncle's feats, with arrows, but the sons of Madri<br>wavered not. Then the mighty Bhimasena, the son of Pandu, beholding<br>Duryodhana and desirous of ending the strife, took up his mace. And<br>beholding the mighty-armed Bhimasena with upraised mace and looking like<br>the crested Kailasa mount, thy sons fled away in terror. Duryodhana,<br>however, excited with wrath, urged the Magadha division consisting of ten<br>thousand elephants of great activity. Accompanied by that elephant<br>division and placing the ruler of Magadha before him, king Duryodhana<br>advanced towards Bhimasena. Beholding that elephant division advancing<br>towards him, Vrikodara, mace in hand, jumped down from his car, uttering<br>a loud roar like that of a lion. And armed with that mighty mace which<br>was endued with great weight and strength of adamant, he rushed towards<br>that elephant division, like the Destroyer himself with wide open mouth.<br>And the mighty-armed Bhimasena endued with great strength, slaying<br>elephants with his mace, wandered over the field, like the slayer of<br>Vritra among the Danava host. And with the loud shouts of the roaring<br>Bhima, shouts that made the mind and the heart to tremble with fear, the<br>elephants, crouching close, lost all power of motion. Then the sons of<br>Draupadi, and that mighty car-warrior, the son of Subhadra, and Nakula<br>and Sahadeva, and Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race, protecting Bhima's<br>rear, rushed behind him, checking all by scattering their arrowy showers<br>like the very clouds pouring rain on the mountain breast. And those<br>Pandava warriors struck off the heads of their foes battling from the<br>backs of elephants, with well-tempered and keen-edged shafts of diverse<br>forms.[380] And the heads (of elephant-riders), and arms decked with<br>ornaments, and hands with iron-hooks in grasp, falling fast, resembled a<br>stony shower. And the headless trunk of elephant-riders on the necks of<br>the beasts they rode, looked like headless trees on mountain summits. And<br>we beheld mighty elephants felled and falling, slain by Dhrishtadyumna,<br>the high-souled son of Prishata. Then the ruler of the Magadhas, in that<br>battle, urged his elephant resembling Airavata himself, towards the car<br>of Subhadra's son. Beholding that mighty elephant advancing towards him,<br>that slayer of hostile heroes, the brave son of Subhadra, slew it with a<br>single shaft. And when the ruler of the Magadhas was thus deprived of his<br>elephant, that conqueror of hostile cities viz., the son of Krishna, then<br>struck off that king's head with a broad-headed shaft with silver wings.<br>And Bhimasena, the son of Pandu, having penetrated that elephant<br>division, began to wander over the field, crushing those beasts around<br>him like Indra himself crushing the mountains. And we beheld elephants<br>slain in that battle by Bhimasena, each with only one stroke (of his<br>mace), like hills riven by thunder. And many elephants, huge as hills,<br>were slain there, having their tusks broken or temples, or bones, or<br>backs, or frontal globes. And others, O king, deprived of life, lay there<br>with foaming mouths. And many mighty elephants, with frontal globes<br>completely smashed, vomited large quantities of blood. And some, from<br>fear, laid themselves down on the ground like (so many) hillocks. And<br>smeared with the fat and blood (of elephants) and almost bathed in their<br>marrow, Bhima wandered over the field like the Destroyer himself, club in<br>hand. And Vrikodara, whirling that mace of his which was wet with the<br>blood of elephants, became terrible and awful to behold, like the wielder<br>of Pinaka armed with Pinaka.[381] And those huge tuskers, while (thus)<br>crushed by the angry Bhima, suddenly fled away, afflicted, crushing thy<br>own ranks. And these mighty bowmen and car-warriors, headed by Subhadra's<br>son (all the while) protected that battling hero whirling his gory<br>mace[382] wet with the blood of elephants, like the celestials protecting<br>the wielder of the thunder-bolt. Of terrible soul, Bhimasena then looked<br>like the Destroyer. himself. Indeed, O Bharata, putting forth his<br>strength on all sides, mace in arms, we beheld Bhimasena then to resemble<br>Sankara himself dancing (at the end of the Yuga), and his fierce, heavy,<br>and sounding mace to resemble the club of Yama and possessed of the sound<br>of Indra's bolt. And that gory mace of his, smeared with marrow and hair,<br>resembled (also) the angry Rudra's Pinaka while he is engaged in<br>destroying all creatures. As a herdsman chastises his herd of cattle with<br>a goad, so did Bhima smite that elephant division with that mace of his.<br>And while thus slaughtered by Bhima with his mace and with shafts (by<br>those that protected his rear), the elephants ran on all sides, crushing<br>the cars of thy own army. Then driving away those elephants from the<br>field like a mighty wind driving away masses of clouds, Bhima stood there<br>like wielder of the trident on a crematorium."
