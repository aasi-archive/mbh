                            Sanjaya said, "After the ranks of thy army and theirs had been disposed<br>in battle-array, that mighty car-warrior, Dhananjaya, felling in that<br>conflict leaders of car-divisions with his arrows, caused a great<br>carnage, O Bharata, among the car-ranks. The Dhartarashtras, (thus)<br>slaughtered in battle by Pritha's son, like the Destroyer himself at the<br>end of the Yuga, still fought perseveringly with the Pandavas. Desirous.<br>of (winning) blazing glory and (bent upon) making death (the only ground<br>for) a cessation of the fight, with minds undirected to anything else,<br>they broke the Pandava ranks in many places and were also themselves<br>broken. Then both the Pandava and the Kaurava troops broke, changed<br>positions, and fled away. Nothing could be distinguished. An earthly dust<br>arose, shrouding the very sun. And nobody there could distinguish, either<br>the cardinal or the subsidiary directions. And everywhere the battle<br>raged, O king, the combatants being guided by the indications afforded by<br>colours, by watch-words, names and tribal distinctions. And the array of<br>the Kauravas, O king, could not be broken, duly protected as it was by<br>Bharadwaja's son, O sire.[371] And so the formidable array of the Pandava<br>also, protected by Savyasachin, and well-guarded by Bhima, could not be<br>broken. And the cars and elephants in close ranks, O king, of both the<br>armies, and other combatants, coming out of their respective arrays,<br>engaged in conflict. And in that fierce battle cavalry soldiers felled<br>cavalry soldiers, with polished swords of sharp edges and long lances.<br>And car-warriors, getting car-warriors (within reach) in that fierce<br>conflict, felled them with shafts decked with golden wings. And<br>elephant-riders, of thy side and theirs, felled large numbers of<br>elephant-riders in close ranks, with broad-headed shafts and arrows and<br>lances. And large bodies of infantry, inspired with wrath towards one<br>another, cheerfully felled combatants of their own class with short<br>arrows and battle-axes. And car-warriors, O king, getting elephant-riders<br>(within reach) in that conflict, felled them along with their elephants.<br>And elephant-riders similarly felled car-warriors. And, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, the cavalry soldier with his lance felled the car-warrior<br>in that conflict, and the car-warrior also felled the cavalry soldier.<br>And both the armies the foot-soldier, felled the car-warrior in the<br>combat, and the car-warrior felled the foot-soldiers, with sharp weapons.<br>And elephant-riders felled horse-riders, and horse-riders felled warriors<br>on the backs of elephants. And all this appeared exceedingly wonderful.<br>And here and there foot-soldiers, were felled by foremost of<br>elephant-riders, and elephant-riders were seen to be felled by the<br>former. And bands of foot-soldiers, by hundreds and thousands, were seen<br>to be felled by horse-riders and horse-riders by foot-soldiers. And<br>strewn with broken standards and bows and lances and housings of<br>elephants, and costly blankets and bearded darts, and maces, and clubs<br>furnished with spikes, and Kampanas, and darts, and variegated coats of<br>mail and Kunapas, and iron hooks, and polished scimitars, and shafts<br>furnished with golden wings, the field, O best of Bharata's race, shone<br>as if with floral wreaths. And the earth, miry with flesh and blood,<br>became impassable with the bodies of men and steeds and elephants slain<br>in that dreadful battle. And drenched with human blood, the earthy dust<br>disappeared. And the cardinal points, all around, became perfectly clear,<br>O Bharata. And innumerable headless trunks rose up all around indicating,<br>O Bharata, of the destruction of the world. And in that terrible and<br>awful battle, car-warriors were seen to run away in all directions. Then<br>Bhishma and Drona, and Jayadratha, the ruler of the Sindhus and<br>Purumitra, and Vikarna, and Sakuni the son of Suvala-these warriors<br>invincible in battle and possessed of leonine prowess-staying in battle<br>broke the ranks of the Pandavas. And so Bhimasena and the Rakshasa<br>Ghatotkacha, and Satyaki, and Chekitana, and the sons of Draupadi, O<br>Bharata, supported by all the kings (on their side), began to grind thy<br>troops and thy sons stationed in battle, like the gods grinding the<br>Danavas. And those bulls among Kshatriyas, striking one another in<br>battle, became terrible to behold and covered with blood shone like<br>Kinsukas. And the foremost warriors of both armies, vanquishing their<br>opponents, looked, O king, like the planetary luminaries in the<br>firmament. Then thy son Duryodhana, supported by a thousand cars, rushed<br>to battle with the Pandavas and the Rakshasa. And so all the Pandavas,<br>with a large body of combatants rushed in battle against those chastisers<br>of foes, the heroic Bhishma and Drona. And the diadem-decked (Arjuna)<br>also, excited with rage rushed against the foremost of kings. And<br>Arjuna's son (Abhimanyu), and Satyaki, both advanced against the forces<br>of Suvala's son. And then commenced once more a fearful battle, making<br>the hair to stand on end, between thine and the enemy's troops both<br>desirous of vanquishing each other."
