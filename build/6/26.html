                            [(Bhagavad Gita Chapter II)]<br><br>Sanjaya said,&#8212;"Unto him thus possessed with pity, his eyes filled and<br>oppressed with tears, and desponding, the slayer of Madhu said these<br>words."<br><br>The Holy One said,&#8212;"Whence, O Arjuna, hath come upon thee, at such a<br>crisis, this despondency that is unbecoming a person of noble birth, that<br>shuts one out from heaven, and that is productive of infamy? Let no<br>effeminacy be thine, O son of Kunti. This suits thee not. Shaking off<br>this vile weakness of hearts, arise, O chastiser of foes.&#8212;"<br><br>Arjuna said,&#8212;"How, O slayer of Madhu, can I with arrows contend in<br>battle against Bhishma and Drona, deserving as they are. O slayer of<br>foes, of worship?[133] Without slaying (one's) preceptors of great glory,<br>it is well (for one), to live on even alms in this world. By slaying<br>preceptors, even if they are avaricious of wealth, I should only enjoy<br>pleasures that are bloodstained![134] We know not which of the two is of<br>greater moment to us, viz., whether we should conquer them or they should<br>conquer us. By slaying whom we would not like to live,&#8212;even they, the<br>sons of Dhritarashtra, stand before (us). My nature affected by the taint<br>of compassion, my mind unsettled about (my) duty, I ask thee. Tell me<br>what is assuredly good (for me). I am thy disciple. O, instruct me, I<br>seek thy aid.[135] I do not see (that) which would dispel that grief of<br>mine blasting my very senses, even if I obtain a prosperous kingdom on<br>earth without a foe or the very sovereignty of the gods.[136]'"<br><br>Sanjaya said,&#8212;Having said this unto Hrishikesa, that chastiser of<br>foes-Gudakesa&#8212;(once more) addressed Govinda, saying,&#8212;'I will not<br>fight,'&#8212;and then remained silent.[137] Unto him overcome by despondency,<br>Hrishikesa, in the midst of the two armies, said.<br><br>"The Holy One said,&#8212;'Thou mournest those that deserve not to be mourned.<br>Thou speakest also the words of the (so-called) wise. Those, however,<br>that are (really) wise, grieve neither for the dead nor for the living.<br>It is not that, I or you or those rulers of men never were, or that all<br>of us shall not hereafter be. Of an Embodied being, as childhood, youth,<br>and, decrepitude are in this body, so (also) is the acquisition of<br>another body. The man, who is wise, is never deluded in this.[138] The<br>contacts of the senses with their (respective) objects producing<br>(sensations of) heat and cold, pleasure and pain, are not permanent,<br>having (as they do) a beginning and an end. Do thou. O Bharata, endure<br>them. For the man whom these afflict not, O bull among men, who is the<br>same in pain and pleasure and who is firm in mind, is fit for<br>emancipation.[139] There is no (objective) existence of anything that is<br>distinct from the soul; nor non-existence of anything possessing the<br>virtues of the soul. This conclusion in respect of both these hath been<br>arrived at by those that know the truths (of things).[140] Know that [the<br>soul] to be immortal by which all this [universe] is pervaded. No one can<br>compass the destruction of that which is imperishable. It hath been said<br>that those bodies of the Embodied (soul) which is eternal, indestructible<br>and infinite, have an end. Do thou, therefore, fight, O Bharata. He who<br>thinks it (the soul) to be the slayer and he who thinks it to be the<br>slain, both of them know nothing; for it neither slays nor is slain. It<br>is never born, nor doth it ever die; nor, having existed, will it exist<br>no more. Unborn, unchangeable, eternal, and ancient, it is not slain upon<br>the body being perished. That man who knoweth it to be indestructible,<br>unchangeable, without decay, how and whom can he slay or cause to be<br>slain? As a man, casting off robes that are worn out, putteth on others<br>that are new, so the Embodied (soul), casting off bodies that are worn<br>out, entereth other bodies that are new. Weapons cleave it not, fire<br>consumeth it not; the waters do not drench it, nor doth the wind waste<br>it. It is incapable of being cut, burnt, drenched, or dried up. It is<br>unchangeable, all-pervading, stable, firm, and eternal. It is said to be<br>imperceivable, inconceivable and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing it to<br>be such, it behoveth thee not to mourn (for it). Then again even if thou<br>regardest it as constantly born and constantly dead, it behoveth thee not<br>yet, O mighty-armed one, to mourn (for it) thus. For, of one that is<br>born, death is certain; and of one that is dead, birth is certain.<br>Therefore. it behoveth thee not to mourn in a matter that is unavoidable.<br>All beings (before birth) were unmanifest. Only during an interval<br>(between birth and death), O Bharata, are they manifest; and then again,<br>when death comes, they become (once more) unmanifest. What grief then is<br>there in this? One looks upon it as a marvel; another speaks of it as a<br>marvel. Yet even after having heard of it, no one apprehends it truly.<br>The Embodied (soul), O Bharata, is ever indestructible in everyone's<br>body. Therefore, it behoveth thee not to grieve for all (those)<br>creatures. Casting thy eyes on the (prescribed) duties of thy order, it<br>behoveth thee not to waver, for there is nothing else that is better for<br>a Kshatriya than a battle fought fairly. Arrived of itself and (like<br>unto) an open gate of heaven, happy are those Kshatriyas, O Partha, that<br>obtain such a fight. But if thou dost not fight such a just battle, thou<br>shalt then incur sin by abandoning the duties of thy order and thy fame.<br>People will then proclaim thy eternal infamy, and to one that is held in<br>respect, infamy is greater (as an evil) than death itself. All great<br>car-warriors will regard thee as abstaining from battle from fear, and<br>thou wilt be thought lightly by those that had (hitherto) esteemed thee<br>highly. Thy enemies, decrying thy prowess, will say many words which<br>should not be said. What can be more painful than that? Slain, thou wilt<br>attain to heaven; or victorious, thou wilt enjoy the Earth. Therefore,<br>arise, O son of Kunti, resolved for battle. Regarding pleasure and pain,<br>gain and loss, victory and defeat, as equal, do battle for battle's sake<br>and sin will not be thine.[141] This knowledge, that hath been<br>communicated to thee is (taught) in the Sankhya (system). Listen now to<br>that (inculcated) in Yoga (system). Possessed of that knowledge, thou, O<br>Partha, wilt cast off the bonds of action. In this (the Yoga system)<br>there is no waste of even the first attempt. There are no impediments.<br>Even a little of this (form of) piety delivers from great fear.[142] Here<br>in this path, O son of Kuru, there is only one state of mind, consisting<br>in firm devotion (to one object, viz., securing emancipation). The minds<br>of those, however, that are not firmly devoted (to this), are<br>many-branched (un-settled) and attached to endless pursuits. That flowery<br>talk which, they that are ignorant, they that delight in the words of the<br>Vedas, they, O Partha, that say that there is nothing else, they whose<br>minds are attached to worldly pleasures, they that regard (a) heaven (of<br>pleasures and enjoyments) as the highest object of acquisition,&#8212;utter<br>and promises birth as the fruit of action and concerns itself with<br>multifarious rites of specific characters for the attainment of pleasures<br>and power,&#8212;delude their hearts and the minds of these men who are<br>attached to pleasures and power cannot be directed to contemplation (of<br>the divine being) regarding it as the sole means of emancipation.[143]<br>The Vedas are concerned with three qualities, (viz., religion, profit,<br>and pleasure). Be thou, O Arjuna, free from them, unaffected by pairs of<br>contraries (such as pleasure and pain, heat and cold, etc.), ever<br>adhering to patience without anxiety for new acquisitions or protection<br>of those already acquired, and self-possessed, whatever objects are<br>served by a tank or well, may all be served by a vast sheet of water<br>extending all around; so whatever objects may be served by all the Vedas,<br>may all be had by a Brahmana having knowledge (of self or Brahma).[144]<br>Thy concern is with work only, but not with the fruit (of work). Let not<br>the fruit be thy motive for work; nor let thy inclination be for<br>inaction. Staying in devotion, apply thyself to work, casting off<br>attachment (to it), O Dhananjaya, and being the same in success or<br>unsuccess. This equanimity is called Yoga (devotion). Work (with desire<br>of fruit) is far inferior to devotion, O Dhananjaya. Seek thou the<br>protection of devotion. They that work for the sake of fruit are<br>miserable. He also that hath devotion throws off, even in this world,<br>both good actions and bad actions. Therefore, apply thyself to devotion.<br>Devotion is only cleverness in action. The wise, possessed of devotion,<br>cast off the fruit born of action, and freed from the obligation of<br>(repeated) birth, attain to that region where there is no unhappiness.<br>When thy mind shall have crossed the maze of delusion, then shalt thou<br>attain to an indifference as regards the hearable and the heard.[145]<br>When thy mind, distracted (now) by what thou hast heard (about the means<br>of acquiring the diverse objects of life), will be firmly and immovably<br>fixed on contemplation, then wilt thou attain to devotion.'<br><br>"Arjuna said,&#8212;What, O Kesava, are the indications of one whose mind is<br>fixed on contemplation? How should one of steady mind speak, how sit, how<br>move?"<br><br>"The Holy One said,&#8212;'When one casts off all the desires of his heart and<br>is pleased within (his) self with self, then is one said to be of steady<br>mind. He whose mind is not agitated amid calamities, whose craving for<br>pleasure is gone, who is freed from attachment (to worldly objects), fear<br>and wrath, is said to be a Muni of steady mind. His is steadiness of mind<br>who is without affection everywhere, and who feeleth no exultation and no<br>aversion on obtaining diverse objects that are agreeable and<br>disagreeable. When one withdraws his senses from the objects of (those)<br>senses as the tortoise its limbs from all sides, even his is steadiness<br>of mind. Objects of senses fall back from an abstinent person, but not so<br>the passion (for those objects). Even the passion recedes from one who<br>has beheld the Supreme (being).[146] The agitating senses, O son of<br>Kunti, forcibly draw away the mind of even a wise man striving hard to<br>keep himself aloof from them. Restraining them all, one should stay in<br>contemplation, making me his sole refuge. For his is steadiness of mind<br>whose senses are under control. Thinking of the objects of sense, a<br>person's attachment is begotten towards them. From attachment springeth<br>wrath; from wrath ariseth want of discrimination; from want of<br>discrimination, loss of memory; from loss of memory, loss of<br>understanding; and from loss of understanding (he) is utterly ruined. But<br>the self-restrained man, enjoying objects (of sense) with senses freed<br>from attachment and aversion under his own control, attaineth to peace<br>(of mind). On peace (of mind) being attained, the annihilation of all his<br>miseries taketh place, since the mind of him whose heart is peaceful soon<br>becometh steady.[147] He who is not self-restrained hath no contemplation<br>(of self). He who hath no contemplation hath no peace (of mind).[148]<br>Whence can there be happiness for him who hath no peace (of mind)? For<br>the heart that follows in the wake of the sense moving (among their<br>objects) destroys his understanding like the wind destroying a boat in<br>the waters.[149] Therefore, O thou of mighty arms, his is steadiness of<br>mind whose senses are restrained on all sides from the objects of sense.<br>The restrained man is awake when it is night for all creatures; and when<br>other creatures are awake that is night to a discerning Muni.[150] He<br>into whom all objects of desire enter, even as the waters enter the ocean<br>which (though) constantly replenished still maintains its water-mark<br>unchanged&#8212;(he) obtains peace (of mind) and not one that longeth for<br>objects of desire. That man who moveth about, giving up all objects of<br>desire, who is free from craving (for enjoyments) and who hath no<br>affection and no pride, attaineth to peace (of mind). This, O Partha, is<br>the divine state. Attaining to it, one is never deluded. Abiding in it<br>one obtains, on death, absorption into the Supreme Self.'
