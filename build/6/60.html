                            Sanjaya said,&#8212;"When the night passed away, O Bharata, the high-souled<br>Bhishma, with wrath engendered, supported by a large force, and stationed<br>at the head of the Bharata army, proceeded against the foe. And Drona and<br>Duryodhana and Valhika, and also Durmarshana and Chitrasena, the mighty<br>Jayadratha, and other royal warriors, supported by large divisions<br>accompanied, surrounding him all sides. And surrounded by those great and<br>mighty car-warriors endued with great prowess and energy, O king, he<br>shone, O best of monarchs, in the midst of those foremost of royal<br>warriors, like the chief of the celestials in the midst of the gods. And<br>the magnificent standards on the backs of the elephants stationed in<br>front of those ranks, of diverse colours, viz., red, yellow, black and<br>brown, waving in the air, looked exceedingly beautiful. And that army<br>with the royal son of Santanu and other mighty car-warriors and with<br>elephants and steeds, looked resplendent like a mass of clouds charged<br>with lightning, or like the firmament, in the season of rains, with<br>gathering clouds.[374] And then the fierce army of the Kurus, bent on<br>battle and protected by Santanu's son, rushed impetuously towards Arjuna<br>like the fierce current of the ocean-going Ganga.[375] Pervaded by<br>diverse kinds of forces possessed of great strength, and having in its<br>wings elephants, steeds, infantry, and cars in profusion, that array the<br>high-souled (Arjuna) having the prince of apes on his banner beheld from<br>a distance to resemble a mighty mass of clouds.[376] That high-souled<br>hero, that bull among men, upon his car furnished with tall standard and<br>unto which were yoked white steeds, at the head of his (own) division and<br>surrounded by a mighty force, proceeded against the whole hostile army.<br>And all the Kauravas with thy sons, beholding that ape-bannered (warrior)<br>with his excellent standard and handsome car-shaft wrapped (in costly<br>cover), accompanied by that bull of Yadu's race, his charioteer in<br>battle, were filled with dismay. And thy army beheld that best of arrays,<br>which was protected by that mighty car-warrior of the world, viz.,<br>Kiritin, with weapons upraised to have at each of its corners four<br>thousand elephants. Like the array which was formed on the day before by<br>that best of Kurus viz., king Yudhishthira the just, and like of which<br>had never been seen or heard before by human beings, was this one of<br>today (that the Pandavas formed). Then on the field of battle thousand of<br>drums were loudly beaten, and there arose from all the divisions the loud<br>blare of conches and the notes of trumpets and many leonine shouts. Then<br>(innumerable) bows of loud twang, stretched by heroic warriors with shaft<br>fixed on the bowstrings, and the blare of conches, silenced that uproar<br>of drums and cymbals. And the entire welkin filled with that blare of<br>conches was diffused with an earthly dust that made it wonderful to<br>behold. And with that dust the sky looked as if a vast canopy were spread<br>overhead. And beholding that canopy the brave warriors all rushed<br>impetuously (to battle). And car-warriors, struck by car-warriors, were<br>overthrown with charioteers, steeds, cars, and standards. And elephants,<br>struck by elephants, fell down, and foot-soldiers struck by<br>foot-soldiers. And rushing horsemen, struck down by rushing horsemen with<br>lances and swords, fell down with frightful countenances. And all this<br>seemed exceedingly wonderful. And excellent shields decked with golden<br>stars and possessed of solar effulgence, broken by (strokes of)<br>battle-axes, lances and swords dropped on the field.[377] And many<br>car-warriors mangled and bruised by the tusks and the strong trunks of<br>elephants, fell down with their charioteers. And many bulls among<br>car-warriors struck by bulls among car-warriors with their shafts, fell<br>down on the ground. And many persons hearing the wails of horsemen and<br>foot-soldiers struck with the tusks and other limbs of elephants or<br>crushed by the impetus of those huge creatures rushing in close ranks,<br>fell down on the field of battle.[378]<br><br>"Then when cavalry and foot-soldiers were falling fast, and elephants and<br>steeds and cars were flying away in fear, Bhishma, surrounded by many<br>mighty car-warriors, obtained sight of him who had the prince of apes on<br>his standard. And the palmyra-bannered warrior, viz. the son of Santanu,<br>having five palmyras on his standard, then rushed against the<br>diadem-decked (Arjuna) whose car, in consequence of the fleetness of the<br>excellent steeds attached to it was endued with wonderful energy and<br>which blazed like the very lightning in consequence of the energy of his<br>mighty weapons. And so against that son of Indra who was like unto Indra<br>himself, rushed many (other) warriors headed by Drona and Kripa and Salya<br>and Vivinsati and Duryodhana and also Somadatta's son, O king. Then the<br>heroic Abhimanyu, the son of Arjuna, conversant with all weapons and<br>cased in a handsome and golden coat of mail, rushing out of the ranks,<br>quickly proceeded against all those warriors. And that son of Krishna of<br>feats incapable of being borne, baffling the mighty weapons of all those<br>warriors of great strength, looked resplendent like the adorable Agni<br>himself, on the sacrificial altar, of blazing flames, invoked with high<br>mantras. Then Bhishma of mighty energy, creating in that battle a very<br>river whose waters were the blood of foes, and quickly avoiding<br>Subhadra's son, encountered that mighty car-warrior, viz., Partha<br>himself. Then Arjuna decked with diadem and garlands with his Gandiva of<br>wonderful mien and twang loud as the roar of the thunder, shooting<br>showers of arrows, baffled that shower of mighty weapons (shot by<br>Bhishma). And that high-souled warrior having the prince of apes on his<br>banner, of feats incapable of being borne, then poured in return upon<br>Bhishma, that best of all wielders of bows a shower of sharp-edged arrows<br>and polished shafts of broad heads. And so thy troops also beheld that<br>shower of mighty weapons shot by him who had the prince of apes on his<br>banner, opposed and dispersed by Bhishma like the maker of day dispelling<br>(the gloom of night). And the Kurus and the Srinjayas, and all the people<br>there, beheld that single combat between those two foremost of men, viz.,<br>Bhishma and Dhananjaya, proceeding thus steadily and thus distinguished<br>by the terrible twang of the bows of both."
