                            Sanjaya said, "Having rested for a while, O king, both the Kurus and the<br>Pandavas, after the night had passed away, once more went out for battle.<br>And then loud was the uproar, O king, that arose of mighty car-warriors<br>as they prepared for battle, and of tuskers as these were being equipped<br>for the conflict, and of infantry as they put on their armour, and of<br>steeds also, O Bharata. And the blare of conches and the beat of drums<br>became deafening in all parts of the field. Then king Yudhishthira<br>addressed Dhrishtadyumna and said, 'O mighty-armed one, dispose the<br>troops in the array called Makara that scorcheth the foe.' Thus addressed<br>by Pritha's son, that mighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna, that foremost of<br>combatants on cars, issued the order, O great king, to the car-warriors,<br>(for forming the Makara array). Drupada, and Dhananjaya the son of Pandu,<br>formed the head of that array, and Sahadeva and that mighty car-warrior<br>Nakula formed its two eyes. And the mighty Bhimasena formed its beak. And<br>Subhadra's son, and the sons of Draupadi and the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha,<br>and Satyaki, and king Yudhishthira the just, were stationed in its neck.<br>And king Virata that commander of a large division, formed its back,<br>supported by Dhrishtadyumna and a large force. And the five Kekaya<br>brothers consisted its left wing, and that tiger among men, viz.,<br>Dhrishtaketu, and Chekitana of great prowess, stationed in the right<br>wing, stood for protecting that array. And its two feet, O monarch, were<br>constituted by that mighty car-warrior the blessed Kuntibhoja, and<br>Satanika, supported by a large force. And that great bowman, the mighty<br>Sikhandin, surrounded by the Somakas, and Iravat, were stationed in the<br>tail of that Makara array. And having, O Bharata, formed their great<br>array, the Pandavas, O monarch, equipped in mail at dawn, again stood for<br>battle. And with elephants and steeds and cars and infantry, and with<br>standards upraised and umbrellas set up, and armed with bright, whetted<br>weapons, they quickly proceeded against the Kauravas.<br><br>"Then thy sire Devavrata, beholding the (Pandava) army thus arrayed,<br>disposed his army, O king, in counter-array after the form of a huge<br>crane. And in its beak was Bharadwaja's son (Drona). And Aswatthaman and<br>Kripa, O monarch, formed its two eyes. And that foremost, of all bowmen,<br>viz., Kritavarman, united with the ruler of the Kamvojas and with the<br>Valhikas was stationed, O king, in its head. And in its neck. O Bharata,<br>were Surasena, and thy son Duryodhana, O king, surrounded by many kings.<br>And the ruler of the Pragjyotishas, united with the Madras, the Sauviras,<br>and the Kekayas, and surrounded by a large force, was stationed, O king,<br>in its breasts. And Susarman the king of Prasthala, accompanied by his<br>own troops, stood, accoutred in mail, in the left wing. And the Tusharas,<br>the Yavanas and the Sakas, along with the Chulikas, stood in the right<br>wing, O Bharata, of that array. And Srutayush and Sataytish and<br>Somadatta's son, O sire, were stationed in the rear of that array<br>protecting one another.<br><br>"Then the Pandavas, O king, rushed against the Kauravas for battle. The<br>sun, O Bharata, had risen when the battle commenced. And elephants<br>proceeded against elephants. And horsemen rushed against horsemen,<br>car-warriors against car-warriors, O king, and against elephants also, in<br>that dreadful conflict. And car-men rushed against riders of elephants,<br>and riders of elephants against horsemen. And car-warriors engaged with<br>foot-soldiers, and cavalry with infantry. And all the warriors, O king,<br>excited with wrath, rushed against one another in battle. And the Pandava<br>army, protected by Bhimasena and Arjuna and the twins, looked beautiful<br>like the night decorated with stars. And thy army also, with Bhishma and<br>Kripa and Drona and Salya and Duryodhana, and others, shone like the<br>firmament spangled with the planets. And Bhimasena the son of Kunti,<br>endued with great prowess, beholding Drona rushed against the division of<br>Bharadwaja's son, borne by his steeds of great fleetness. Then Drona,<br>excited with wrath in that conflict and endued with great energy, pierced<br>Bhima with nine shafts made wholly of iron, aiming his vital limbs.<br>Deeply pierced by Bharadwaja's son in that conflict, Bhima despatched<br>Drona's charioteer to the region of Yama. Thereupon the son of<br>Bharadwaja, endued with great prowess, himself restraining his steeds,<br>began to consume the Pandava army like fire consuming a heap of cotton.<br>And while thus slaughtered, O king, by Drona and Bhishma, the Srinjayas<br>along with the Kekayas took to flight. And so thy troops also, mangled by<br>Bhima and Arjuna, became deprived of their senses as they stood, like a<br>beautiful female in her pride. And in that conflict destructive of heroes<br>great was the distress, O Bharata, that befell both thy army and theirs.<br>And we beheld the wonderful sight, O Bharata, of the troops fighting with<br>one another regardless of their lives.[403] And the Pandavas and the<br>Kauravas, O king, in that conflict, fought with one another counteracting<br>one another's weapons."
