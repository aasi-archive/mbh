                            Sanjaya said, "Beholding the mighty and terrible array called Krauncha<br>formed by Pandu's son of immeasurable energy, thy son, approaching the<br>preceptor, and Kripa, and Salya, O sire, and Somadatta's son, and<br>Vikarna, and Aswatthaman also, and all his brothers too, headed by<br>Dussasana, O Bharata, and other immeasurable heroes assembled there for<br>battle, said these timely words, gladdening them all, 'Armed with various<br>kinds of weapons, ye all are conversant with the meaning of the<br>scriptures. Ye mighty car-warriors, each of you is singly capable of<br>slaying in battle the sons of Pandu with their troops. How much more<br>then, when ye are united together. Our host, therefore, which is<br>protected by Bhishma, is immeasurable, while that host of theirs, which<br>is protected by Bhima, is measurable.[359] Let the Samsthanas, the<br>Surasenas, the Venikas, the Kukkuras, the Rechakas, the Trigartas, the<br>Madrakas, the Yavanas, with Satrunjayas, and Dussasana, and that<br>excellent hero Vikarna, and Nanda and Upanandaka, and Chitrasena, along<br>with the Manibhadrakas, protect Bhishma with their (respective)<br>troops,'&#8212;Then Bhishma and Drona and thy sons, O sire, formed a mighty<br>array for resisting that of the Parthas. And Bhishma, surrounded by a<br>large body of troops, advanced, leading a mighty army, like the chief of<br>the celestials himself. And that mighty bowman, the son of Bharadwaja,<br>endued with great energy, followed him with the Kuntalas, the Dasarnas,<br>and the Magadhas, O king, and with the Vidarbhas, the Melakas, the<br>Karnas, and the Pravaranas also. And the Gandharas, the Sindhusauviras,<br>the Sivis and the Vasatis with all their combatants also, (followed)<br>Bhishma, that ornament of battle, and Sakuni, with all his troops<br>protected the son of Bharadwaja. And then king Duryodhana, united with<br>all his brothers, with the Aswalakas, the Vikarnas, the Vamanas, the<br>Kosalas, the Daradas, the Vrikas, as also the Kshudrakas and the Malavas<br>advanced cheerfully against the Pandava host. And Bhurisravas, and Sala,<br>and Salya, and Bhagadatta, O sire, and Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti,<br>protected the left flank. And Somadatta, and Susarman, and Sudakshina,<br>the ruler of the Kamvojas and Satayus, and Srutayus, were on the right<br>flank. And Aswatthaman, and Kripa, and Kritavarman of Satwata's race,<br>with a very large division of the troops, were, stationed at the rear of<br>the army. And behind them were the rulers of many provinces, and Ketumat,<br>and Vasudana, and the powerful son of the king of Kasi. Then all the<br>troops on thy side cheerfully waiting for battle, O Bharata, blew their<br>conches with great pleasure, and set up leonine roars. And hearing the<br>shouts of those (combatants) filled with delight the venerable Kuru<br>grandsire, endued with great prowess, uttering a leonine roar, blew his<br>conch. Thereupon, conches and drums and diverse kinds of Pesis and<br>cymbals, were sounded at once by others, and the noise made became a loud<br>uproar. And Madhava and Arjuna, both stationed on a great car unto which<br>were yoked white steeds, blew their excellent conches decked with gold<br>and jewels. And Hrishikesa blew the conch called Panchajanya, and<br>Dhananjaya (that called) Devadatta. And Vrikodara of terrible deeds blew<br>the huge conch called Paundra. And Kunti's son king Yudhishthira blew the<br>conch called Anantavijaya, while Nakula and Sahadeva (those conches<br>called) Sughosa and Manipushpaka.[360] And the ruler of Kasi, and Saivya,<br>and Sikhandin the mighty car-warrior, and Dhrishtadyumna, and Virata, and<br>the mighty car-warrior Satyaki, and that great bowman the king of the<br>Panchalas, and the five sons of Draupadi, all blew their large conches<br>and set up leonine roars. And that great uproar uttered there by those<br>heroes, loudly reverberated through both the earth and the welkin. Thus,<br>O great king, the Kurus and the Pandavas, both filled with delight,<br>advanced against each other for battling again, and scorching each other<br>thus."
