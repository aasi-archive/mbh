                            [(Bhagavad Gita Chapter VII)]<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'Listen, O son of Pritha, how, without doubt, thou<br>mayst know me fully, fixing thy mind on me, practising devotion, and<br>taking refuge in me. I will now, without leaving anything speak to thee<br>about knowledge and experience, knowing which there would be left nothing<br>in this world (for thee) to know. One among thousands of men striveth for<br>perfection. Of those even that are assiduous and have attained to<br>perfection, only some one knoweth me truly.[203] Earth, water, fire, air,<br>space, mind, also understanding, and consciousness,&#8212;thus hath my nature<br>been divided eight-fold. This is a lower (form of my) nature. Different<br>from this, know there is a higher (form of my) nature which is animate, O<br>thou of mighty arms, and by which this universe is held.[204] Know that<br>all creatures have these for their source. I am the source of evolution<br>and also of the dissolution of the entire universe. There is nothing<br>else, O Dhananjaya, that is higher than myself. Upon me is all this like<br>a row of pearls on a string. Taste I am in the waters, O soil of Kunti,<br>(and) I am the splendour of both the moon and the sun, I am the Om in all<br>the Vedas, the sound in space, and the manliness in men. I am the<br>fragrant odour in earth, the splendour in fire, the life in all (living)<br>creatures, and penance in ascetics. Know me, O son of Pritha, to be the<br>eternal seed of all beings. I am the intelligence of all creatures endued<br>with intelligence, the glory of all glorious objects. I am also the<br>strength of all that are endued with strength, (myself) freed from desire<br>and thirst, and, O bull of Bharata's race, am the desire, consistent with<br>duty, in all creatures.[205] And all existences which are of the quality<br>of goodness, and which are of the quality of passion and quality of<br>darkness, know that they are, indeed, from me. I am, however, not in<br>them, but they are in me. This entire universe, deluded by these three<br>entities consisting of (these) three qualities knoweth not me that am<br>beyond them and undecaying; since this illusion of mine, depending on the<br>(three) qualities, is exceedingly marvellous and highly difficult of<br>being transcended. They that resort to me alone cross this illusion.[206]<br>Doers of evil, ignorant men, the worst of their species, robbed of their<br>knowledge by (my) illusion and wedded to the state of demons, do not<br>resort to me. Four classes of doers of good deeds worship me, O Arjuna,<br>viz., he that is distressed, that is possessed of knowledge, being always<br>devoted and having his faith in only One, is superior to the rest, for<br>unto the man of knowledge I am dear above everything, and he also is dear<br>to me. All these are noble. But the man of knowledge is regarded (by me)<br>to be my very self, since he, with soul fixed on abstraction, taketh<br>refuge in me as the highest goal. At the end of many births, the man<br>possessed of knowledge attaineth to me, (thinking) that Vasudeva is all<br>this. Such a high-souled person, however, is exceedingly rare. They who<br>have been robbed of knowledge by desire, resort to their godheads,<br>observant of diverse regulations and controlled by their own nature.[207]<br>Whatever form, (of godhead or myself) any worshipper desireth to worship<br>with faith, that faith of his unto that (form) I render steady. Endued<br>with that faith, he payeth his adorations to that (form), and obtaineth<br>from that all his desire, since all those are ordained by me.[208] The<br>fruits, however, of those persons endued with little intelligence are<br>perishable. They that worship the divinities, go to the divinities,<br>(while) they that worship me come even to me.[209] They that have no<br>discernment, regard me who am (really) unmanifest to have become<br>manifest, because they do not know the transcendent and undecaying state<br>of mine than which there is nothing higher.[210] Shrouded by the illusion<br>of my inconceivable power, I am not manifest to all. This deluded world<br>knoweth not me that I am unborn and undecaying. I know, O Arjuna, all<br>things that have been past, and all things that are present, and all<br>things that are to be. But there is nobody that knoweth me. All<br>creatures, O chastiser of foes, are deluded at the time of their birth by<br>the delusion, O Bharata, of pairs of opposites arising from desire and<br>aversion. But those persons of meritorious deeds whose sins have attained<br>their end, being freed from the delusion of pairs of opposites, worship<br>me, firm in their vow (of that worship). Those who, taking refuge in me,<br>strive for release from decay and death, know Brahman, the entire<br>Adhyatma, and action.[211] And they who know me with the Adhibhuta, the<br>Adhidaiva, and the Adhiyajna, having minds fixed on abstraction, know me<br>at the time of their departure (from this world).[212]
