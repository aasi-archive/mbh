                            Sanjaya said,&#8212;"Just as the holy Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa had said, in<br>that very manner the kings of the Earth, mustered together, came to the<br>encounter. On that day on which the battle commenced Soma approached the<br>region of Pitris.[92] The seven large planets, as they appeared in the<br>firmament, all looked blazing like fire.[93] The Sun, when he rose,<br>seemed to be divided in twain. Besides, that luminary, as it appeared in<br>the firmament, seemed to blaze forth in flames.[94] Carnivorous jackals<br>and crows, expecting dead bodies to feast upon, began to utter fierce<br>cries from all directions that seemed to be ablaze. Every day the old<br>grandsire of the Kurus, and the son of Bharadwaja, rising from bed in the<br>morning, with concentrated mind, said,&#8212;'Victory to the sons of<br>Pandu'&#8212;while those chastisers of foes used (at the same time) yet to<br>fight for thy sake according to the pledge they had given. Thy father<br>Devavrata, fully conversant with every duty, summoning all the kings,<br>said these words (unto them). 'Ye Kshatriyas, this broad door is open to<br>you for entering heaven. Go ye through it to the region of Sakra and<br>Brahman. The Rishis of olden times have showed you this eternal path.[95]<br>Honour ye yourselves by engaging in battle with attentive minds. Nabhaga,<br>and Yayati, and Mandhatri, and Nahusa, and Nriga, were crowned with<br>success and obtained the highest region of bliss by feats like these. To<br>die of disease at home is sin for a Kshatriya. The death he meets with in<br>battle is his eternal duty.'&#8212;Thus addressed, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>by Bhishma, the kings, looking beautiful in their excellent cars,<br>proceeded to the heads of their respective divisions. Only Vikartana's<br>son Karna, with his friends and relatives, O bull of Bharata's race, laid<br>aside his weapons in battle for the sake of Bhishma. Without Karna then,<br>thy sons and all the kings on thy side proceeded, making the ten points<br>of the horizon resound with their leonine roars. And their divisions<br>shone brightly, O king, with white umbrellas, banners, standards,<br>elephants, steeds, cars, and foot-soldiers. And the Earth was agitated<br>with the sounds of drums and tabors and cymbals, and the clatter of<br>car-wheels. And the mighty car-warriors, decked with their bracelets and<br>armlets of gold and with their bows (variegated with gold), looked<br>resplendent like hills of fire. And with his large palmyra-standard<br>decked with five stars, Bhishma, the generalissimo of the Kuru army,[96]<br>looked like the resplendent Sun himself. Those mighty bowmen of royal<br>birth, O bull of Bharata's race, that were on thy side, all took up their<br>positions, O king, as Santanu's son ordered. (King) Saivya of the country<br>of the Govasanas, accompanied by all the monarchs, went out on a princely<br>elephant worthy of royal use and graced with a banner on its back. And<br>Aswatthaman, of the complexion of the lotus, went out ready for every<br>emergency, stationing himself at the very head of all the divisions, with<br>his standard bearing the device of the lion's tail. And Srutayudha and<br>Chitrasena and Purumitra and Vivinsati, and Salya and Bhurisravas, and<br>that mighty car-warrior Vikarna,&#8212;these seven mighty bowmen on their<br>carts and cased in excellent mail, followed Drona's son behind but in<br>advance of Bhishma. The tall standards of these warriors, made of gold,<br>beautifully set up for adorning their excellent cars, looked highly<br>resplendent. The standard of Drona, the foremost of preceptors, bore the<br>device of a golden altar decked with a water-pot and the figure of a bow.<br>The standard of Duryodhana guiding many hundreds and thousands of<br>divisions bore the device of an elephant worked in gems. Paurava and the<br>ruler of the Kalingas, and Salya, these Rathas took up their position in<br>Duryodhana's van. On a costly car with his standard bearing the device of<br>a bull, and guiding the very van (of his division), the ruler of the<br>Magadhas marched against the foe.[97] That large force of the Easterners<br>looking like the fleecy clouds of autumn[98] was (besides) protected by<br>the chief of the Angas (Karna's son Vrishaketu) and Kripa endued with<br>great energy. Stationing himself in the van of his division with his<br>beautiful standard of silver bearing the device of the boar, the famous<br>Jayadratha looked highly resplendent. A hundred thousand cars, eight<br>thousand elephants, and sixty thousand cavalry were under his<br>command.[99] Commanded by the royal chief of the Sindhus, that large<br>division occupying the very van (of the army) and abounding with untold<br>cars, elephants, and steeds, looked magnificent. With sixty thousand cars<br>and ten thousand elephants, the ruler of the Kalingas, accompanied by<br>Ketumat, went out. His huge elephants, looking like hills, and adorned<br>with Yantras,[100] lances, quivers and standards, looked exceedingly<br>beautiful. And the ruler of the Kalingas, with his tall standard<br>effulgent as fire, with his white umbrella, and golden curass, and<br>Chamaras (wherewith he was fanned), shone brilliantly. And Ketumat also,<br>riding on an elephant with a highly excellent and beautiful hook, was<br>stationed in battle, O King, like the Sun in the midst of (black) clouds.<br>And king Bhagadatta, blazing with energy and riding on that elephant of<br>his, went out like the wielder of the thunder. And the two princes of<br>Avanti named Vinda and Anuvinda, who were regarded as equal to<br>Bhagadatta, followed Ketumat, riding on the necks of their elephants.<br>And, O king, arrayed by Drona and the royal son of Santanu, and Drona's<br>son, and Valhika, and Kripa, the (Kaurava) Vyuha[101] consisting of many<br>divisions of cars was such that the elephants formed its body; the kings,<br>its head; and the steeds, its wings. With face towards all sides, that<br>fierce Vyuha seemed to smile and ready to spring (upon the foe)."
