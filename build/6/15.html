                            Sanjaya said,&#8212;"Deserving as thou art, this question is, indeed, worthy<br>of thee, O great king. It behoveth thee not, however, to impute this<br>fault to Duryodhana. The man who incurreth evil as the consequence of his<br>own misconduct, should not attribute that misconduct to others. O great<br>king, the man that doth every kind of injury to other men, deserveth to<br>be slain by all men in consequence of those censurable deeds of his. The<br>Pandavas unacquainted with the ways of wickedness had, for a long time,<br>with their friends and counsellors, looking up to thy face, borne the<br>injuries (done to them) and forgiven them, dwelling in the woods.<br><br>"Of steeds and elephants and kings of immeasurable energy that which hath<br>been seen by the aid of Yoga-power, hear, O lord of earth, and do not set<br>thy heart on sorrow. All this was pre-destined, O king. Having bowed down<br>to thy father, that (wise and high-souled[88]) son of Parasara, through<br>whose grace, (through whose boon bestowed on me,) I have obtained<br>excellent and celestial apprehension, sight beyond the range of the<br>visual sense, and hearing, O king, from great distance, knowledge of<br>other people's hearts and also of the past and the future, a knowledge<br>also of the origin of all persons transgressing the ordinances,[89] the<br>delightful power of coursing through the skies, and untouchableness by<br>weapons in battles, listen to me in detail as I recite the romantic and<br>highly wonderful battle that happened between the Bharatas, a battle that<br>makes one's hair stand on end.<br><br>"When the combatants were arrayed according to rule and when they were<br>addrest for battle. Duryodhana, O king, said these words to Dussasana,&#8212;O<br>Dussasana, let cars be speedily directed for the protection of Bhishma,<br>and do thou speedily urge all our divisions (to advance). That hath now<br>come to me of which I had been thinking for a series of years, viz., the<br>meeting of the Pandavas and the Kurus at the head of their respective<br>troops. I do not think that there is any act more important (for us) in<br>this battle than the protecting of Bhishma. If protected he will slay the<br>Pandavas, the Somakas, and the Srinjayas. That warrior of pure soul<br>said,&#8212;'I will not slay Sikhandin. It is heard that he was a female<br>before. For this reason he should be renounced by me in battle. For this,<br>Bhishma should be particularly protected. Let all my warriors take up<br>their positions, resolved to slay Sikhandin. Let also all the troops from<br>the east, the west, the south, and the north, accomplished in every kind<br>of weapon, protect the grandsire. Even the lion of mighty strength, if<br>left unprotected may be slain by the wolf. Let us not, therefore, cause<br>Bhishma to be slain by Sikhandin like the lion slain by the jackal.<br>Yudhamanyu protects the left wheel, and Uttamauja protects the right<br>wheel of Phalguni. Protected by those two, Phalguni himself protects<br>Sikhandin. O Dussasana, act in such a way that Sikhandin who is protected<br>by Phalguni and whom Bhishma will renounce, may not slay Ganga's son."
