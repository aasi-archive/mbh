                            [(Bhagavad Gita Chapter XVI)]<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'Fearlessness, purity of heart, perseverance in (the<br>pursuit of) knowledge and Yoga meditation, gifts, self-restraint,<br>sacrifice, study of the Vedas, ascetic penances, uprightness,[288]<br>abstention from injury, truth, freedom from anger, renunciation,<br>tranquillity, freedom from reporting other's faults, compassion for all<br>creatures, absence of covetousness, gentleness, modesty, absence of<br>restlessness, vigour, forgiveness, firmness, cleanliness, absence of<br>quarrelsomeness, freedom from vanity,&#8212;these become his, O Bharata, who<br>is born to godlike possessions. Hypocrisy, pride, conceit, wrath,<br>rudeness and ignorance, are, O son of Pritha, his who is born to demoniac<br>possessions. God-like possessions are deemed to be for deliverance; the<br>demoniac for bondage. Grieve not, O son of Pandu, for thou art born to<br>god-like possessions. (There are) two kinds of created beings in this<br>world, viz., the god-like and the demoniac. The god-like have been<br>described at length. Hear now, from me, O son of Pritha, about the<br>demoniac. Persons of demoniac nature know not inclination or<br>disinclination. Neither purity, nor good conduct, nor truth exist in<br>them.[289] They say that the universe is void of truth, of guiding<br>principle, (and) of ruler; produced by the union of one another (male and<br>female) from lust, and nothing else. Depending on this view, these men of<br>lost selves, little intelligence, and fierce deeds, these enemies (of the<br>world), are born for the destruction of the universe.[290] Cherishing<br>desires that are insatiable, and endued with hypocrisy, conceit and<br>folly, they adopt false notions through delusion and engage in unholy<br>practices. Cherishing boundless thoughts limited by death (alone), and<br>regarding the enjoyment of (their ) desires as the highest end, they are<br>persuaded that that is all. Fettered by the hundred nooses of hope,<br>addicted to lust and wrath, they covet to obtain this wealth<br>to-day,&#8212;This I will obtain later,&#8212;This wealth I have,&#8212;This (wealth)<br>will be mine in addition,&#8212;This foe hath been slain by me,&#8212;I will slay<br>even others,&#8212;I am lord,&#8212;I am the enjoyer,&#8212;I am successful, powerful,<br>happy,&#8212;I am rich and of noble birth,&#8212;Who else is there that is like<br>me?&#8212;I will sacrifice,&#8212;I will make gifts,&#8212;I will be merry,&#8212;thus<br>deluded by ignorance,&#8212;tossed about by numerous thoughts, enveloped in<br>the meshes of delusion, attached to the enjoyment of objects of desire,<br>they sink into foul hell. Self-conceited, stubborn, filled with the pride<br>and intoxication of wealth, they perform sacrifices that are nominally<br>so, with hypocrisy and against the (prescribed) ordinance. Wedded to<br>vanity, power, pride, lust and wrath, these revilers hate Me in their own<br>bodies and those of others. These haters (of Me), cruel, the vilest among<br>men, and unholy, I hurl continually down into demoniac wombs. Coming into<br>demoniac wombs, deluded birth after birth, they, O son of Kunti, without<br>attaining to Me go down to the vilest state. Three-fold is the way to<br>hell, ruinous to the self, viz., lust, wrath, likewise avarice.<br>Therefore, these three, one should renounce. Freed from these three gates<br>of darkness, a man, O son of Kunti, works out his own welfare, and then<br>repairs to his highest goal. He who, abandoning the ordinances of the<br>scriptures, acts only under the impulses of desire, never attains to<br>perfection, nor happiness, nor the highest goal. Therefore, the<br>scriptures should be thy authority in determining what should be done and<br>what should not be done. It behoveth thee to do work here, having<br>ascertained what hath been declared by the ordinances of the scriptures.'"
