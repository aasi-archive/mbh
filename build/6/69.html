                            Sanjaya said, "After the night had passed away and the sun had risen, the<br>two armies, O king, approached each other for battle. Beholding each<br>other, each rushed in united ranks towards the other excited with rage<br>and desirous of vanquishing the other. And in consequence of thy evil<br>policy, O king, the Pandavas and the Dhartarashtras thus rushed, cased in<br>mail and forming battle-array, for striking each other. And the array<br>that Bhishma protected from all sides, O king, was of the shape of a<br>Makara.[391] And so the Pandavas also, O king, protected the array they<br>had formed (of their troops). Then thy sire Devavrata, O great king, that<br>foremost of car-warriors, proceeded in advance, supported by a large<br>division of cars. And others, viz., car-warriors, infantry, elephants,<br>and cavalry, all followed him, each stationed in the place allotted. And<br>beholding them prepared for battle, the illustrious sons of Pandu arrayed<br>their troops in that invincible and prince of arrays called the<br>Syena.[392] And in the beak of that array shone Bhimasena of great<br>strength. And in its two eyes were the invincible Sikhandin and<br>Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race. And in the head was the heroic Satyaki<br>of prowess incapable of being baffled. And in its neck was Arjuna shaking<br>his Gandiva. And in its left wing was the high-souled and blessed Drupada<br>with his son and supported by an akshauhini of all forces. And the king<br>of the Kekayas, owning an akshauhini, formed the right wing (of that<br>array). And in its back were the sons of Draupadi, and Subhadra's son of<br>great prowess. And in its tail was the heroic king Yudhishthira himself,<br>of excellent prowess, supported by his twin brothers. Then in the battle<br>(that ensued). Bhima, penetrating the Makara array (of the Kauravas)<br>through its mouth, and approaching Bhishma, covered him with his shafts.<br>Then in that great battle, Bhishma possessed of great prowess shot his<br>mighty weapons, confounding the combatants of the Pandavas disposed in<br>battle-array. And when the combatants (of the Pandava army) were thus<br>confounded, Dhananjaya, speedily proceeding, pierced Bhishma at the van<br>of battle with a thousand arrows. And counteracting, in that conflict,<br>the weapons shot by Bhishma, Arjuna stood ready for the combat, supported<br>by his own division filled with cheerfulness.[393] Then king Duryodhana,<br>that foremost of mighty men, that great car-warrior, beholding that<br>terrible carnage of his troops and remembering the slaughter of his<br>brothers (on the previous day), came quickly towards Bharadwaja's son,<br>and addressing him, said, 'O preceptor, O sinless one, thou art ever my<br>well-wisher,&#8212;Relying on thee as also on the grandsire Bhishma,<br>ourselves, hope to vanquish without doubt the very gods in battle, let<br>alone the sons of Pandu that are destitute of energy and prowess. Blessed<br>be thou, act in such away that the Pandavas may be slain. Thus addressed<br>in battle by thy son, Drona penetrated into the Pandava array in the very<br>sight of Satyaki. Then O Bharata, Satyaki checked the son of Bharadwaja,<br>(and thereupon) ensued a battle that was fierce in its incidents and<br>awful to behold. Then Bharadwaja's son excited with rage and endued with<br>great prowess, as if smiling the while, pierced the grandson of Sini with<br>ten shafts at his shoulder-joint. And Bhimasena also, excited with rage,<br>pierced Bharadwaja's son (with many shafts), desirous of protecting<br>Satyaki, O king, from Drona that foremost of all warriors. Then Drona and<br>Bhishma, and Salya also, O sire, excited with rage, covered Bhimasena, in<br>that battle, with their shafts. Thereupon Abhimanyu excited with wrath,<br>and the sons of Draupadi, O sire, pierced with their sharp-pointed shafts<br>all those warriors with upraised weapons. Then in that fierce battle, the<br>great bowman Sikhandin rushed against those two mighty warriors, viz.,<br>Bhishma and Drona who, excited with rage, had (thus) fallen upon the<br>Pandavas. Firmly grasping his bow whose twang resembled the roar of the<br>clouds, that hero, shrouding the very Sun with his arrows, quickly<br>covered his antagonists therewith. The grandsire of the Bharatas,<br>however, getting Sikhandin before him, avoided him, remembering the<br>femininity of his sex. Then, O king, urged by thy son, Drona rushed to<br>battle, desirous of protecting Bhishma in that stress. Sikhandin,<br>however, approaching Drona that foremost of all wielders of weapons,<br>avoided, from fear, that warrior resembling the blazing fire that appears<br>at the end of the Yuga. Then, O king, thy son with a large force,<br>desirous of winning great glory, proceeded to protect Bhishma. And the<br>Pandavas also proceeded, O king, firmly setting their hearts upon<br>victory, and the battle then that took place between the combatants of<br>both armies desirous of victory and fame, was fierce and highly<br>wonderful, resembling that (in days of yore) between the gods and Danavas.
