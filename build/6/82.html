                            Sanjaya said, "O chief of the Bharatas, Ganga's son, once more addressing<br>thy son who was plunged in thought, told him these delightful words,<br>'Myself and Drona and Salya and Kritavarman of Satwata's race, and<br>Aswatthaman and Vikarna and Bhagadatta and Suvala's son and Vinda and<br>Anuvinda of Avanti, and Valhika with the Valhikas,[410] and the mighty<br>king of the Trigartas and the invincible ruler of the Magadhas,<br>Vrihadvala the king of the Kosalas, and Chitrasena and Vivingsati and<br>many thousands of car-warriors graced with tall standards, a large number<br>of country-born steeds well-mounted with excellent horse-soldiers and<br>many infuriate elephants of large size with temporal juice issuing from<br>their mouths and cheeks, and many brave foot-soldiers armed with diverse<br>weapons and born in diverse realms, are all prepared to do battle for thy<br>sake.[411] These, and many others ready for thy sake to lay down their<br>lives, are, as I think, competent to vanquish the very gods in battle. I<br>should, however, always tell thee, O king, what is for thy good. The<br>Pandavas are incapable of being vanquished by the very gods with Vasava.<br>They have Vasudeva for their ally and are equal to Mahendra himself in<br>prowess. As regards myself, I shall, however, always do thy bidding.<br>Either I shall vanquish the Pandavas in battle or they will vanquish me.<br>Having said these words, the grandsire gave him an excellent herb of<br>great efficacy for healing his wounds. And therewith thy son was cured of<br>his wounds. Then at dawn when the sky was clear, the valiant Bhishma,<br>that foremost of men well-versed in all kinds of array, himself disposed<br>his troops in that array called Mandala bristling with weapons. And it<br>abounded with foremost of warriors and with tuskers and foot-soldiers.<br>And it was surrounded on all sides with many thousands of cars, and with<br>large bodies of horsemen armed with swords and lances. Near unto every<br>elephant were placed seven cars, and near unto every car were placed<br>seven horsemen. And behind every horseman were placed seven bowmen, and<br>behind every bowman were seven combatants with shields. And thus, O king,<br>thy army, arrayed by mighty car-warriors, stood for fierce battle,<br>protected by Bhishma. And ten thousand horses, and as many elephants, and<br>ten thousand cars, and thy sons, all equipped in mail, viz., the heroic<br>Chitrasena and others, protected the grandsire. And it was seen that<br>Bhishma was protected by those brave warriors, and those princes<br>themselves of great strength, accoutred in mail, were (in their turn)<br>protected by him. And Duryodhana accoutred in mail sat upon his car on<br>the field, and possessed of every grace, looked resplendent like Sakra<br>himself in heaven. Then, O Bharata, loud were the shouts uttered by thy<br>sons and deafening the clatter of cars and the uproar of musical<br>instruments. That mighty and impenetrable array of those slayer of foes,<br>viz., the Dhartarashtras (in the form called) Mandala, (thus) arrayed by<br>Bhishma, began to proceed, facing the west. Incapable of being defeated<br>by enemies, it looked beautiful in every point. Beholding then the array<br>called Mandala that was exceedingly fierce, king Yudhishthira himself<br>disposed his troops in the array called Vajra. And when the divisions<br>were thus arrayed, car-warriors and horsemen, stationed in their proper<br>places, uttered leonine shouts. Accompanied by their respective forces,<br>the brave warriors of both armies, well versed in smiting, and longing<br>for battle, proceeded, desirous of breaking each other's array. And<br>Bharadwaja's son proceeded against the king of the Matsyas, and his son<br>(Aswatthaman) against Sikhandin. And king Duryodhana himself rushed<br>against the son of Prishata. And Nakula and Sahadeva went forth against<br>the king of the Madras. And Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti proceeded<br>against Iravat. And many kings together battled with Dhananjaya. And<br>Bhimasena, exerting himself well, opposed the son of Hridika in battle.<br>And possessed of great prowess, (Abhimanyu) the son of Arjuna, fought in<br>battle, O king, against the sons Chitrasena and Vikarna, and Durmarshana.<br>And Hidimva's son, that prince of the Rakshasas, rushed against that<br>mighty bowman, the ruler of the Pragjyotishas, like one infuriate<br>elephant against another. And the Rakshasa Alamvusha, O king, excited<br>with wrath, rushed in battle against the invincible Satyaki in the midst<br>of his followers. And Bhurisravas, exerting himself greatly, fought<br>against Dhrishtaketu. And Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, proceeded<br>against king Srutayush. And Chekitana in that battle fought against<br>Kripa. And others (among the Kuru warriors), exerting themselves<br>powerfully, proceeded against that mighty car-warrior Bhima. And<br>thousands of (other) kings surrounded Dhananjaya, with darts, lances,<br>arrows, maces, and spiked clubs in their hands. Then Arjuna, excited with<br>great wrath, addressing him of Vrishni's race, said, 'Behold, O Madhava,<br>the Dhartarashtra troops in battle, arrayed by the high-souled son of<br>Ganga, acquainted with every kind of array. Behold, O Madhava, those<br>brave warriors, countless in number, and desirous of battle (with me).<br>Behold, O Kesava, the ruler of the Trigartas with his brothers.[412] This<br>very day I shall slay them all, O Janardana, before thy eyes,&#8212;them, that<br>is, O foremost of the Yadus, who, longing for battle (with me), are on<br>the field.' Having said these words, the son of Kunti, rubbing his<br>bowstring, showered his arrows on that multitude of kings. And those<br>great bowmen also, poured on him thick showers of arrows, like clouds<br>that fill a lake with torrents of rain in the rainy season. And loud<br>shouts were heard in thy army, O monarch, when in that great battle the<br>two Krishnas were seen covered with thick showers of arrows. And the<br>gods, the celestial Rishis, and the Gandharvas with the Uragas, beholding<br>the two Krishnas in that state, were filled with great wonder. Then<br>Arjuna, O king, excited with wrath, invoked the Aindra weapon. And then<br>the prowess we beheld of Vijaya seemed to be highly wonderful insomuch<br>that those showers of weapons shot by his foes were checked by his<br>myriads of arrows. And there among those thousands of kings and steeds<br>and elephants, was none, O king, that was not wounded. And others, O<br>sire, the son of Pritha pierced, each with two or three arrows. And while<br>being thus struck by Pritha, they sought the protection of Bhishma, the<br>son of Santanu. But Bhishma then became the rescuer of those warriors who<br>were like men sinking in the fathomless deep. And in consequence of those<br>warriors thus flying away and mixing with thy troops, thy broken ranks, O<br>king, were agitated like the vast deep with a tempest."
