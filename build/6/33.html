                            [(Bhagavad Gita Chapter IX)]<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'Now I will tell thee that art without envy that most<br>mysterious knowledge along with experience, knowing which thou wilt be<br>freed from evil. This is royal science, a royal mystery, highly<br>cleansing, directly apprehensible, consistent with the sacred laws, easy<br>to practise, (and) imperishable. Those persons, O chastiser of foes, who<br>have no faith in this sacred doctrine, not attaining to me, return to the<br>path of this world that is subject to destruction. This entire universe<br>is pervaded by me in my unmanifest form. All entities are in me, but I do<br>not reside in them. Nor yet are all entities in me. Behold my divine<br>power. Supporting all entities and producing all entities, myself doth<br>not (yet) reside in (those) entities. As the great and obiquitious<br>atmosphere always occupieth space, understand that all entities reside in<br>me in the same way.[219] All entities, O son of Kunti, attain to my<br>nature at the close of a Kalpa. I create them again at the beginning of a<br>Kalpa.[220] Regulating my own (independent) nature I create again and in<br>this whole assemblage of entities which is plastic in consequence of its<br>subjection to nature.[221] Those acts, however, O Dhananjaya, do not<br>fetter me who sitteth as one unconcerned, being unattached to those acts<br>(of creation). Through me, the overlooker, primal nature produceth the<br>(universe of) mobiles and immobiles. For the reason, O son of Kunti, the<br>universe passeth through its rounds (of birth and destruction).[222] Not<br>knowing my supreme nature of the great lord of all entities, ignorant<br>people of vain hopes, vain acts, vain knowledge, confounded minds, wedded<br>to the delusive nature of Asuras and Rakshasas, disregard me (as one)<br>that hath assumed a human body. But high-souled ones, O son of Pritha,<br>possessed of divine nature, and with minds directed to nothing else,<br>worship me, knowing (me) to be the origin of all entities and<br>undestructible. Always glorifying me, (or) striving with firm vows, (or)<br>bowing down to me, with reverence and ever devoted, (they) worship<br>me.[223] Others again, performing the sacrifice of knowledge, worship me,<br>(some) as one, (some) as distinct, (some) as pervading the universe, in<br>many forms.[224] I am the Vedic sacrifice, I am the sacrifice enjoined in<br>the Smritis, I am Swadha, I am the medicament produced from herbs; I am<br>the mantra, I am the sacrificial libation, I am the fire, and I am the<br>(sacrificial) offering.[225] I am the father of this universe, the<br>mother, the creator, grandsire; (I am) the thing to be known, the means<br>by which everything is cleaned, the syllable Om, the Rik, the Saman and<br>the Yajus, (I am) the goal, the supporter, the lord, the on-looker, the<br>abode, the refuge, the friend, the source, the destruction, the support,<br>the receptacle; and the undestructible seed. I give heat, I produce and<br>suspend rain; I am immortality, and also death; and I am the existent and<br>the non-existent, O Arjuna. They who know the three branches of<br>knowledge, also drink the Soma juice, and whose sins have been cleansed<br>worshipping me by sacrifices, seek admission into heaven; and these<br>attaining to the sacred region of the chief of the gods, enjoy in heaven<br>the celestial pleasure of the gods. Having enjoyed that celestial world<br>of vast extent, upon exhaustion of their merit they re-enter the mortal<br>world. It is thus that they who accept the doctrines of the three Vedas<br>and wish for objects of desires, obtain going and coming. Those persons<br>who, thinking (of me) without directing their minds to anything else,<br>worship me, of those who are (thus) always devoted (to me)&#8212;I make them<br>gifts and preserve what they have. Even those devotees who, endued with<br>faith worship other godheads even they, O son of Kunti, worship me alone,<br>(though) irregularly.[226] I am the enjoyer, as also the lord, of all<br>sacrifices. They, however, do not know me truly; hence they fall off<br>(from heaven). They whose vows are directed to the Pitris attain to the<br>Pitris; who direct (their) worship to the inferior spirits called Bhutas<br>attain to Bhutas; they who worship me, attain even to myself. They who<br>offer me with reverence, leaf, flower, fruit, water&#8212;that offered with<br>reverence, I accept from him whose self is pure.[227] Whatever thou dost,<br>whatever eatest, whatever drinkest, whatever givest, whatever austerities<br>thou performest, manage it in such a way, O son of Kunti, that it may be<br>an offering to me. Thus mayst thou be freed from the fetters of action<br>having good and evil fruits. With self endued with renunciation and<br>devotion, thou wilt be released and will come to me. I am alike to all<br>creatures; there is none hateful to me, none dear. They, however, who<br>worship me with reverence are in me and I also am in them. If even a<br>person of exceedingly wicked conduct worshippeth me, without worshipping<br>any one else, he should certainly be regard as good, for his efforts are<br>well-directed. (Such a person) soon becometh of virtuous soul, and<br>attaineth to eternal tranquillity. Know, O son of Kunti, that none<br>devoted to me is ever lost. For, O son of Pritha, even they who may be of<br>sinful birth, women, Vaisyas, and also Sudras, even they, resorting to<br>me, attain to the supreme goal. What then (shall I say) of holy Brahmanas<br>and saints who are my devotees? Having come to this transient and<br>miserable world, be engaged in my worship.[228] Fix thy mind on me; be my<br>devotee, my worshipper; bow to me; and thus making me thy refuge and<br>applying thy self to abstraction, thou wilt certainly come to me.'
