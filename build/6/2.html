                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Seeing then the two armies (standing) on the east<br>and the west for the fierce battle that was impending, the holy Rishi<br>Vyasa, the son of Satyavati, that foremost of all persons acquainted with<br>the Vedas, that grandsire of the Bharatas, conversant with the past, the<br>present, and the future, and beholding everything as if it were present<br>before his eyes, said these words in private unto the royal son of<br>Vichitravirya who was then distressed and giving way to sorrow,<br>reflecting on the evil policy of his sons.<br><br>"Vyasa said,&#8212;'O king, thy sons and the other monarchs have their hour<br>arrived.[10] Mustered in battle they will kill one another. O Bharata,<br>their hour having come, they will all perish. Bearing in mind the changes<br>brought on by time, do not yield thy heart to grief. O king, if thou wish<br>to see them (fighting) in battle, I will, O son, grant thee vision.<br>Behold the battle."<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;'O best of regenerate Rishi, I like not to behold<br>the slaughter of kinsmen. I shall, however, through thy potency hear of<br>this battle minutely."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued.&#8212;"Upon his not wishing to see the battle but<br>wishing to hear of it, Vyasa, that lord of boons, gave a boon to Sanjaya.<br>(And addressing Dhritarashtra he said),&#8212;'This Sanjaya, O king, will<br>describe the battle to thee. Nothing in the whole battle will be beyond<br>this one's eyes.' Endued, O king with celestial vision, Sanjaya will<br>narrate the battle to thee. He will have knowledge of everything.<br>Manifest or concealed, (happening) by day or by night, even that which is<br>thought of in the mind, Sanjaya shall know everything. Weapons will not<br>cut him and exertion will not fatigue him. This son of Gavalgani will<br>come out of the battle with life. As regards myself, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, the fame of these Kurus, as also of all the Pandavas, I will<br>spread. Do not grieve. This is destiny, O tiger among men. It behoveth<br>thee not to give way to grief. It is not capable of being prevented. As<br>regards victory, it is there where righteousness is.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"That highly-blessed and holy grandsire of the<br>Kurus, having said so, once more addressed Dhritarashtra and<br>said,&#8212;'Great will the slaughter be, O monarch, in this battle. I see<br>here also (numerous) omens indicative of terror. Hawks and vultures, and<br>crows and herons, together with cranes, are alighting on the tops of<br>trees and gathering in flocks. These birds, delighted at the prospect of<br>battle, are looking down (on the field) before them. Carnivorous beasts<br>will feed on the flesh of elephants and steeds. Fierce herons, foreboding<br>terror, and uttering merciless cries, are wheeling across the centre<br>towards the southern region. In both the twilights, prior and posterior,<br>I daily behold, O Bharata, the sun during his rising and setting to be<br>covered by headless trunks. Tri-coloured clouds with their extremities<br>white and red and necks black, charged with lightning, and resembling<br>maces (in figure) envelope the sun in both twilights. I have seen the<br>sun, the moon, and the stars to be all blazing. No difference in their<br>aspect is to be noted in the evening. I have seen this all day and all<br>night. All this forbodes fear. On even the fifteenth night of the<br>lighted-fortnight in (the month of) Kartika, the moon, divested of<br>splendour, became invisible, or of the hue of fire, the firmament being<br>of the hue of the lotus. Many heroic lords of earth, kings and princes,<br>endued with great bravery and possessed of arms resembling maces, will be<br>slain and sleep lying down on the earth. Daily I notice in the sky during<br>night time the fierce cries of battling boars and cats.[11] The images of<br>gods and goddesses sometimes laugh, sometimes tremble, and sometimes<br>again these vomit blood through their mouths and sometimes they sweat and<br>sometimes fall down. O monarch! drums, without being beaten, give sounds,<br>and the great cars of Kshatriyas move without (being drawn by) animals<br>yoked to them. Kokilas, wood-peckers, jaws, water-cocks, parrots, crows,<br>and peacocks, utter terrible cries. Here and there, cavalry soldiers,<br>cased in mail, armed with weapons, send forth fierce shouts. At sun-rise<br>flights of insects, by hundreds are seen. In both twilights, the cardinal<br>quarters seem to be ablaze, and the clouds, O Bharata, shower dust and<br>flesh. She, O king, who is celebrated over the three worlds and is<br>applauded by the righteous, even that (constellation) Arundhati keepeth<br>(her lord) Vasistha on her back. The planet Sani also, O king, appeareth<br>afflicting (the constellation) Rohini. The sign of the deer in the Moon<br>hath deviated from its usual position. A great terror is indicated. Even<br>though the sky is cloudless, a terrible roar is heard there. The animals<br>are all weeping and their tears are falling fast.'"
