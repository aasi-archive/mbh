                            Sanjaya said,&#8212;"When the night had passed away, loud became the noise<br>made by the kings, all exclaiming, Array! Array! 'With the blare of<br>conches and the sound of drums that resembled leonine roars, O Bharata,<br>with the neigh of steeds, and the clatter of car-wheels, with the noise<br>of obstreperous elephants and the shouts, clapping of arm-pits, and cries<br>of roaring combatants, the din caused everywhere was very great. The<br>large armies of the Kurus and the Pandavas, O king, rising at sunrise,<br>completed all their arrangements. Then when the Sun rose, the fierce<br>weapons of attack and defence and the coats of mail of both thy sons and<br>the Pandavas, and the large and splendid armies of both sides, became<br>fully visible. There elephants and cars, adorned with gold, looked<br>resplendent like clouds mingled with lightning. The ranks of cars,<br>standing in profusion, looked like cities. And thy father, stationed<br>there, shone brilliantly, like the full moon. And the warriors armed with<br>bows and swords and scimitars and maces, javelins and lances and bright<br>weapons of diverse kinds, took up their positions in their (respective)<br>ranks. And resplendent standards were seen, set up by thousands, of<br>diverse forms, belonging to both ourselves and the foe. And made of gold<br>and decked with gems and blazing like fire, those banners in thousands<br>endued with great effulgence, looked beautiful like heroic combatants<br>cased in mail gazed at those standards, longing for battle.[90] And many<br>foremost of men, with eyes large as those of bulls endued with quivers,<br>and with hands cased in leathern fences, stood at the heads of their<br>divisions, with their bright weapons upraised. And Suvala's son Sakuni,<br>and Salya, Jayadratha and the two princes of Avanti named Vinda and<br>Anuvinda, and the Kekaya brothers, and Sudakshina the ruler of the<br>Kamvojas and Srutayudha the ruler of the Kalingas, and king Jayatsena,<br>and Vrihadvala the ruler of the Kosalas, and Kritavarman of Satwata's<br>race,&#8212;these ten tigers among men, endued with great bravery and<br>possessing arms that looked like maces,&#8212;these performers of sacrifices<br>with plentiful gifts (to Brahmanas), stood each at the head of an<br>Akshauhini of troops. These and many other kings and princes, mighty<br>car-warriors conversant with policy, obedient to the commands of<br>Duryodhana, all cased in mail, were seen stationed in their respective<br>divisions. All of them, cased in black deer-skins, endued with great<br>strength, accomplished in battle, and cheerfully prepared, for<br>Duryodhana's sake, to ascend to the region of Brahma,[91] stood there<br>commanding ten efficient Akshauhinis. The eleventh great division of the<br>Kauravas, consisting of the Dhartarashtra troops, stood in advance of the<br>whole army. There in the van of that division was Santanu's son. With his<br>white head-gear, white umbrella, and white mail, O monarch, we beheld<br>Bhishma of unfailing prowess look like the risen moon. His standard<br>bearing the device of a palmyra of gold himself stationed on a car made<br>of silver, both the Kurus and the Pandavas beheld that hero looking like<br>the moon encircled by white clouds. The great bowmen amongst the<br>Srinjayas headed by Dhrishtadyumna, (beholding Bhishma) looked like<br>little animals when they would behold a mighty yawning lion. Indeed, all<br>the combatants headed by Dhrishtadyumna repeatedly trembled in fear.<br>These, O king, were the eleven splendid divisions of thy army. So also<br>the seven divisions belonging to the Pandavas were protected by foremost<br>of men. Indeed, the two armies facing each other looked like two oceans<br>at the end of the Yuga agitated by fierce Makaras, and abounding with<br>huge crocodiles. Never before, O king, did we see or hear of two such<br>armies encountering each other like these of the Kauravas.'
