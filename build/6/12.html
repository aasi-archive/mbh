                            "Sanjaya said, 'O Kauravya, that which is heard about the islands in the<br>north, I will recount to thee, O Great king. Listen to me now. (Thither<br>in the north) is the ocean whose waters are clarified butter. Then is the<br>ocean whose waters are curds. Next cometh the ocean whose waters are<br>wine, and then is another ocean of water. The islands, O king, are double<br>in area of one another as they proceed further and further towards the<br>north. And they are surrounded, O king, by these oceans.[69] In the<br>island that is in the middle, there is a large mountain called Goura made<br>of red arsenic; on the western island, O king, is the mountain Krishna<br>that is the favourite (abode) of Narayana. There Kesava guardeth<br>celestial gems (in profusion), and thence, inclined to grace, he<br>bestoweth happiness on creatures. Along with the kingdoms there, O king,<br>the (celestial) clump of Kusa grass in Kusadwipa, and the Salmali tree in<br>the island of Salmalika, are adored. In the Krauncha island also, the<br>mountain called Maha-krauncha that is a mine of all kinds of gems is, O<br>king, always adored by all the four orders of men. (There), O monarch, is<br>the mountain called Gomanta that is huge and consists of all kinds of<br>metals, and whereon always resideth, mingling with those that have been<br>emancipated, the puissant Narayana, otherwise called Hari, graced with<br>prosperity and possessed of eyes like lotus leaves. In Kusadwipa, O king<br>of kings, there is another mountain variegated with corals and called<br>after the name of that island itself. This mountain is inaccessible and<br>made of gold. Possessed of great splendour, O Kauravya, there is a third<br>mountain there that is called Sumida. The sixth is called Harigiri. These<br>are the six principal mountains. The intervening spaces between one<br>another of these six mountains increaseth in the ratio of one to two as<br>they proceed further and further towards the north. The first Varsha is<br>called Audhido; the second is Venumandala; the third is called Suratha;<br>the fourth is known by the name of Kamvala; the fifth Varsha is called<br>Dhritimat; and the sixth is named Prabhakara; the seventh Varsha is<br>called Kapila. These are the seven successive Varshas. In these, gods and<br>Gandharvas, and other creatures of the universe, sport and take delight.<br>In these Varshas the inhabitants never die. There, O king, are no<br>robbers, nor any tribes of Mlecchas. All the residents are almost white<br>in complexion, and very delicate, O king.<br><br>"'As regards the rest of the islands, O ruler of men, I will recount all<br>that hath been heard by me. Listen, O monarch, with an attentive mind. In<br>the Krauncha island, O great king, there is a large mountain called<br>Krauncha. Next to Krauncha is Vamanaka; and next to Vamanaka is<br>Andhakara. And next to Andhakara,[70] O king, is that excellent of<br>mountains called Mainaka. After Mainaka, O monarch, is that best of<br>mountains called Govinda; and after Govinda, O king, is the mountain<br>called Nivida. O multiplier of thy race, the intervening spaces between<br>one another of these mountains increaseth in the ratio of one to two. I<br>will now tell thee the countries that lie there. Listen to me as I speak<br>of them. The region near Krauncha is called Kusala; that near Vamanaka is<br>Manonuga. The region next to Manonuga, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, is<br>called Ushna. After Ushna is Pravaraka; and after Pravaraka is<br>Andhakaraka. The country after Andhakaraka is named Munidesa. After<br>Munidesa the region is called Dundubhiswana teeming with Siddhas and<br>Charanas. The people are almost white in complexion, O king. All these<br>countries, O monarch, are the habitations of gods and Gandharvas. In (the<br>island of) Pushkara is a mountain called Pushkara that abounds with<br>jewels and gems. There always dwelleth the divine Prajapati himself. Him<br>all the gods and great Rishis always adore with gratifying words and<br>worship reverently, O king. Diverse gems from Jamvudwipa are used there.<br>In all these islands, O king, Brahmacharyya, truth, and self-control of<br>the dwellers, as also their health and periods of life, are in the ratio<br>of one to two as the islands are more and more remote (northwards). O<br>king, the land in those islands, O Bharata, comprises but one country,<br>for that is said to be one country in which one religion is met with. The<br>Supreme Prajapati himself, upraising the rod of chastisement, always<br>dwelleth there, protecting those islands. He, O monarch, is the king. He<br>is their source of bliss. He is the father, and he is the grand-father.<br>He it is, O best of men, that protecteth all creatures there, mobile or<br>immobile. Cooked food, O Kauravya, cometh there of itself and the<br>creatures eat it daily. O mighty-armed one. After these regions is seen a<br>habitation of the name of Sama. It is of a starry-shape having four<br>corners, and it hath, O king, thirty-three mandalas. There dwell, O<br>Kauravya, four princely elephants adored by all.[71] They are, O best of<br>the Bharatas, Vamana, and Airavata, and another, and also Supratika.[72]<br>O king, with rent cheeks and mouth, I do not venture to calculate the<br>proportions of these four elephants.[73] Their length, breadth and<br>thickness have for ever remained unascertained. There in those regions, O<br>king, winds blow irregularly from all directions.[74] These are seized by<br>those elephants with the tips of their trunks which are of the complexion<br>of the lotus and endued with great splendour and capable of drawing up<br>everything in their way. And soon enough after seizing them they then<br>always let them out. The winds, O king, thus let out by those respiring<br>elephants, come over the Earth and in consequence thereof creatures draw<br>breath and live.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;'Thou hast, O Sanjaya, told me everything about the<br>first subject very elaborately. Thou hast also indicated the positions of<br>the islands. 'Tell now, O Sanjaya, about what remains.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said,&#8212;'Indeed, O great king, the islands have all been<br>described to thee. Listen now to what I truly say about the heavenly<br>bodies and about Swarbhanu, O chief of the Kauravas, as regards its<br>dimensions. It is heard, O king, that the planet Swarbhanu is globular.<br>Its diameter is twelve thousand Yojanas, and its circumference, because<br>it is very large, is forty-two thousand Yojanas, O sinless one,[75] as<br>said by the learned of olden times. The diameter of the moon, O king, is<br>stated to be eleven thousand Yojanas. Its circumference, O chief of the<br>Kurus, is stated to be thirty-eight thousand nine hundred Yojanas of the<br>illustrious planet of cool rays. It hath been heard that the diameter of<br>the beneficent, fast going and light-giving Sun, O thou of Kuru's race,<br>is ten thousand Yojanas, and his circumference, O king, is thirty-five<br>thousand eight hundred miles, in consequence of his largeness, O sinless<br>one. These are the dimensions reckoned here, O Bharata, of Arka. The<br>planet Rahu, in consequence of his greater bulk, envelops both the Sun<br>and the Moon in due times. I tell thee this in brief. With the eye of<br>science, O great king, I have now told thee all that thou hadst asked.<br>Let peace be thine. I have now told thee about the construction of the<br>universe as indicated in the Shastras. Therefore, O Kauravya, pacify thy<br>son Duryodhana.[76]'<br><br>"Having listened to this charming Bhumi Parva, O chief of the Bharatas, a<br>Kshatriya becometh endued with prosperity, obtaineth fruition of all his<br>desires, and winneth the approbation of the righteous.[77] The king who<br>listeneth to this on days of the full-moon or the new-moon, carefully<br>observing vows all the while, hath the period of his life, his fame and<br>energy, all enhanced. His (deceased) sires and grandsires become<br>gratified. Thou hast now heard of all the merits that flow from this<br>Varsha of Bharata where we now are!'"
