                            Sanjaya said, "Sikhandin with Virata king of the Matsyas speedily<br>approached Bhishma that invincible and mighty bowman. And Dhananjaya<br>encountered Drona and Kripa, and Vikarna and many other kings, brave in<br>battle, all mighty bowmen endued with great strength, as also that mighty<br>bowman the ruler of the Sindhus supported by his friends and kinsmen and<br>many kings of the west and the south also, O bull of Bharata's race. And<br>Bhimasena proceeded against that mighty bowman, viz., thy vindictive son<br>Duryodhana, and also against Dussaha. And Sahadeva proceeded against<br>those invincible warriors, viz., Sakuni and that mighty car-warrior<br>Uluka, those great bowmen, who were sire and son. And that mighty<br>car-warrior Yudhishthira, deceitfully treated by thy son, proceeded in<br>that battle, O king, against the elephant division (of the Kauravas). And<br>that son of Pandu and Madri, viz., the heroic Nakula capable of wringing<br>tears from the foe, engaged in battle with the excellent car-warriors of<br>the Trigartas. And those invincible warriors, viz., Satyaki and<br>Chekitana, and the mighty son of Subhadra, proceeded against Salya and<br>the Kaikeyas. And Dhrishtaketu and the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, both<br>invincible in battle, proceeded against the car-division of thy sons. And<br>that mighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna, that generalissimo (of the<br>Pandava forces) of immeasurable soul, engaged in battle, O king, with<br>Drona of fierce achievements. And it was thus that those heroic and<br>mighty bowmen of thy army and the Pandavas, engaged in battle, began to<br>strike one another. And when the sun had reached the meridian and the sky<br>was brilliantly illumined by his rays, the Kauravas and the Pandavas<br>began to slay one another. Then cars, furnished with standards from whose<br>tops pennons were afloat, variegated with gold and covered with<br>tiger-skins, looked beautiful as they moved on the field of battle. And<br>the shouts of warriors engaged in battle from desire of vanquishing one<br>another, became as loud as leonine roars. And that encounter which we<br>beheld between the heroic Srinjayas and the Kurus, was fierce in the<br>extreme and highly wonderful. And in consequence of the arrows shot all<br>around, we could not, O king, distinguish, O chastiser of foes, the<br>firmament, the sun and the cardinal and the subsidiary points of the<br>compass. And the splendour, like that of the blue lotus, of darts with<br>polished points, of bearded lances hurled (at the foe), of well-tempered<br>sabres and scimitars, of variegated coats of mail and of the ornaments<br>(on the persons of the warriors), illumined the welkin and the cardinal<br>and the subsidiary points with its effulgence. And the field of battle in<br>many places, O king, shone in consequence of the bodies of monarchs whose<br>effulgence resembled that of the moon and the sun. And brave<br>car-warriors, tigers among men shone in that battle, O king, like the<br>planets in the firmament. And Bhishma, that foremost of car-warriors,<br>excited with rage, checked the mighty Bhimasena in the very sight of the<br>troops. And the impetuous shafts shot by Bhishma, furnished with golden<br>wings, and whetted on stone, and rubbed with oil pierced Bhima in that<br>battle. Then Bhimasena endued with great strength hurled at him, O<br>Bharata, a dart of fierce impetuosity that resembled a wrathful snake.<br>But Bhishma in that combat cut off with straight shafts that dart with<br>staff made of gold and difficult of being borne, as it coursed<br>impetuously towards him. And with another broad-headed shaft, sharp and<br>well-tempered, he cut off Bhimasena's bow, O Bharata, into two parts.<br>Then, O king, in that battle, Satyaki, coming quickly towards Bhishma,<br>pierced thy sire with innumerable keen-edged and sharp-pointed shafts of<br>fierce impetuosity shot from his bowstring drawn to the ear. Then<br>Bhishma, aiming an exceedingly fierce shaft, felled the charioteer of the<br>Vrishni hero from his box in the car. And when the charioteer of<br>Satyaki's car was thus slain, his steeds, O king, bolted away. Endued<br>with the speed of the tempest or the mind, they ran wild over the field.<br>Then cries were uttered by the whole army which became a loud uproar. And<br>exclamation of oh and alas arose from the high-souled warriors of the<br>Pandava army. And those cries-said&#8212;Run, seize, check the horses, go in<br>haste. And this uproar followed Yuyudhana's car. Meanwhile, Bhishma the<br>son of Santanu began to slay the Pandava forces like Indra slaying the<br>Danavas. But the Panchalas and the Somakas, though slain by Bhishma thus,<br>forming yet a laudable resolution, rushed towards Bhishma. And other<br>warriors of the Pandava army, headed by Dhrishtadyumna, and desirous of<br>slaughtering the ranks of thy son, rushed towards Santanu's son in that<br>battle. And so also, O king, the warriors of thy army, headed by Bhishma<br>and Drona, impetuously rushed towards their foes. And thereupon another<br>battle took place."
