                            [(Bhagavad Gita Chapter X)]<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'Once more still, O mighty-armed one, listen to my<br>supernal words which, from desire of (thy) good, I say unto thee that<br>wouldst be pleased (therewith).[229] The hosts of gods know not my<br>origin, nor the great Rishis, since I am, in every way, the source of the<br>gods and the great Rishis.[230] He that knoweth me as the Supreme Lord of<br>the worlds, without birth and beginning, (he), undeluded among mortals,<br>is free from all sins. Intelligence, knowledge, the absence of delusion,<br>forgiveness, truth, self-restraint, and tranquillity, pleasure, pain,<br>birth, death, fear, and also security, abstention from harm, evenness of<br>mind, contentment, ascetic austerities, gift, fame, infamy, these several<br>attributes of creatures arise from me. The Seven great Rishis, the four<br>Maharishis before (them), and the Manus, partaking of my nature, were<br>born from my mind, of whom in this world are these offsprings.[231] He<br>that knoweth truly this pre-eminence and mystic power of mine, becometh<br>possessed of unswerving devotion. Of this (there is) no doubt. I am the<br>origin of all things, from me all things proceed. Thinking thus, the<br>wise, endued with my nature, worship me.[232] Their hearts on me, their<br>lives devoted to me, instructing one another, and gloryfying me they are<br>ever contented and happy.[233] Unto them always devoted, and worshipping<br>(me) with love, I give that devotion in the form of knowledge by which<br>they come to me.[234] Of them, for compassion's sake. I destroy the<br>darkness born of ignorance, by the brilliant lamp of knowledge, (myself)<br>dwelling in their souls.'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'Thou art the Supreme Brahma, the Supreme Abode, the<br>Holiest of the Holy, the eternal Male Being Divine, the First of gods<br>Unborn, the Lord. All the Rishis proclaim thee thus, and also the<br>celestial Rishi Narada; and Asita, Devala, (and) Vyasa; thyself also<br>tellest me (so). All this that thou tellest me, O Kesava, I regard as<br>true since, O Holy One, neither the gods nor the Danavas understand thy<br>manifestation. Thou only knowest thyself by thyself. O Best of Male<br>Beings. O Creator of all things; O Lord of all things, O God of gods, O<br>Lord of the Universe, it behoveth thee to declare without any<br>reservation, those divine perfections of thine by which perfections<br>pervading these worlds thou abidest. How shall I, ever meditating, know<br>thee, O thou of mystic powers, in what particular states mayst thou, O<br>Holy One, be meditated upon by me?[235] Do thou again, O Janardana,<br>copiously declare thy mystic powers and (thy) perfections, for I am never<br>satiated with hearing thy nectar-like words."<br><br>"The Holy One said,&#8212;'Well, unto thee I will declare my divine<br>perfections, by means of the principal ones (among them), O chief of the<br>Kurus, for there is no end to the extent of my (perfections).[236] I am<br>the soul, O thou of curly hair, seated in the heart of every being, I am<br>the beginning, and the middle, and the end also of all beings. I am<br>Vishnu among the Adityas, the resplendent Sun among all luminous bodies;<br>I am Marichi among the Maruts, and the Moon among constellations.[237] I<br>am the Sama Veda among the Vedas; I am Vasava among the gods; I am the<br>mind among the senses; I am the intellect in (living) beings. I am<br>Sankara among the Rudras, the Lord of treasures among the Yakshas and the<br>Rakshasas; I am Pavaka among the Vasus, and Meru among the peaked<br>(mountains). [238] Know me, O son of Pritha, to be Vrihaspati, the chief<br>of household priests. I am Skanda among commanders of forces. I am Ocean<br>among receptacles of water. I am Bhrigu among the great Rishis, I am the<br>One, undestructible (syllable Om) among words. Of sacrifices I am the<br>Japa-sacrifice.[239] Of immobiles I am the Himavat. I am the figtree<br>among all trees, I am Narada among the celestial Rishis. I am Chitraratha<br>among the Gandharvas and the ascetic Kapila among ascetics crowned with<br>Yoga success. Know me to be Uchchaisravas among horses, brought forth by<br>(the churning for) nectar, Airavata among princely elephants, and the<br>king among men. Among weapons I am the thunderbolt, among cows I am (she<br>called) Kamadhuk. I am Kandarpa the cause of reproduction, I am Vasuki<br>among serpents.[240] I am Ananta among Nagas, I am Varuna among acquatic<br>beings, I am Aryaman among the Pitris, and Yama among those that judge<br>and punish.[241] I am Prahlada among the Daityas, and Time among things<br>that count. I am the lion among the beasts, and Vinata's son among winged<br>creatures. Of purifiers I am the wind. I am Rama among wielders of<br>weapons. I am the Makara among fishes, and I am Jahnavi (Ganga) among<br>streams.[242] Of created things I am the beginning and the end and also<br>the middle, O Arjuna. I am the knowledge of Supreme Spirit among all<br>kinds of knowledge, and the disputation among disputants.[243] Among all<br>letters I am the letter A, and (the compound called) Dwanda among all<br>compounds. I am also Time Eternal, and I am the Ordainer with face turned<br>on every side.[244] I am Death that seizeth all, and the source of all,<br>that is to be. Among females, I am Fame, Fortune, Speech, Memory,<br>Intelligence, Constancy, Forgiveness. Of the Sama hymns, I am the<br>Vrihat-sama and Gayatri among metres. Of the months, I am Margasirsha, of<br>the seasons (I am) that which is productive of flowers.[245] I am the<br>game of dice of them that cheat, and the splendour of those that are<br>splendid. I am Victory, I am Exertion, I am the goodness of the good. I<br>am Vasudeva among the Vrishnis, I am Dhananjaya among the sons of Pandu.<br>I am even Vyasa among the ascetics, and Usanas among seers. I am the Rod<br>of those that chastise, I am the Policy of those that seek victory. I am<br>silence among those that are secret. I am the Knowledge of those that are<br>possessed of Knowledge. That which is the Seed of all things, I am that,<br>O Arjuna. There is nothing mobile or immobile, which can exist without<br>me. There is no end, O chastiser of foes, of my divine perfections. This<br>recital of the extent of (those) perfections hath been uttered by me by<br>way (only) of instancing them. Whatever of exalted things (there is) or<br>glorious, or strong, understand thou that everything is born of a portion<br>of my energy. Or rather, what hast thou to do, by knowing all this in<br>detail, O Arjuna? Supporting this entire universe with only a portion (of<br>myself), I stand.[246]"
