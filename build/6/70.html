                            Sanjaya said, "Then Bhishma the son of Santanu fought fiercely,[394]<br>desirous of protecting the sons from the fear of Bhimasena. And the<br>battle that then took place between the kings of the Kaurava and the<br>Pandava armies was awful in the extreme and destructive of great heroes.<br>And in that general engagement, so fierce and terrible, tremendous was<br>the din that arose, touching the very heavens. And in consequence of the<br>shrieks of huge elephants and the neigh of steeds and the blare of<br>conches and beat of drums, the uproar was deafening. Fighting for the<br>sake of victory, the mighty combatants endued with great prowess roared<br>at one another like bulls in a cow-pen. And heads cut off in that battle<br>with keen-edged shafts, incessantly falling, created, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, the appearance of a stony shower in the welkin. Indeed, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, innumerable were the heads lying on the field of battle,<br>decked with ear-rings and turbans and resplendent with ornaments of gold.<br>And the earth was covered with limbs cut off with broad-headed shafts,<br>with heads decked with ear-rings, and with arms adorned with ornaments.<br>And in a moment the whole field was strewn over with bodies cased in<br>mail, with arms decked with ornaments, with faces beautiful as the moon<br>and having eyes with reddish corners, and with every limb, O king, of<br>elephants, steeds and men. And the dust (raised by the warriors) looked<br>like a thick cloud, and the bright implements of destruction, like<br>flashes of lightning. And the noise made by the weapons resembled the<br>roar of thunder. And that fierce and awful passage-at-arms, O Bharata,<br>between the Kurus and the Pandavas caused a very river of blood to flow<br>there. And in that terrible, fierce, and awful battle causing the hair<br>stand on end, Kshatriya warriors incapable of defeat incessantly poured<br>their arrowy showers. And the elephants of both thy army and the enemy's,<br>afflicted with those arrowy showers, shrieked aloud and ran hither and<br>thither in fury. And in consequence of (the twang of) bows, endued with<br>great energy, of fierce and heroic warriors excited with fury, and of<br>flapping of their bow-strings against their leathern fences, nothing<br>could be distinguished.[395] And all over the field which looked like a<br>lake of blood, headless trunks stood up, and the kings bent upon slaying<br>their foes, rushed to battle. And brave warriors of immeasurable energy<br>and possessed of arms resembling stout bludgeons, slew one another with<br>arrows and darts and maces and scimitars. And elephants, pierced with<br>arrows and deprived of riders to guide them with hooks, and steeds<br>destitute of riders, wildly ran in all directions. And many warriors, O<br>best of the Bharatas, belonging to both thy army and that of the foe,<br>deeply pierced with shafts jumped up and fell down. And in that encounter<br>between Bhima and Bhishma, heaps of arms and heads, as also of bows and<br>maces and spiked clubs and hands and thighs, of legs and ornaments and<br>bracelets, were seen lying over the field. And here and there over the<br>field, O king, were seen large bodies of unretreating elephants and<br>steeds and cars. And the Kshatriya warriors, urged on by fate, slew one<br>another with maces, swords, lances, and straight shafts. And others<br>endued with great heroism and accomplished in fight, encountered one<br>another with their bare arms that resembled spiked clubs made of iron.<br>And other heroic warriors of thy army, engaged with the combatants of the<br>Pandava host, fought on slaying one another with clenched fists and<br>knees, and slaps and blows, O king. And with the fallen and falling<br>warriors and those weltering in agony on the ground, the field of battle<br>everywhere became, O king, terrible to behold, and car-warriors, deprived<br>of the cars and grasping excellent swords, rushed at one another,<br>desirous of slaughter. Then king Duryodhana, surrounded by a large<br>division of Kalingas, and placing Bhishma ahead, rushed towards the<br>Pandavas. And so the Pandava combatants also, supporting Vrikodara, and<br>owning fleet animals, rushed, excited with rage, against Bhishma."
