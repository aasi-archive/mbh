                            Sanjaya said, "Hearing that his son Iravat had been slain, Dhananjaya was<br>filled with great grief and sighed like a snake. And addressing Vasava in<br>the midst of battle, he said these words, 'Without doubt, the high-souled<br>Vidura of great wisdom had before seen (with his mind's eye) this awful<br>destruction of the Kurus and the Pandavas. It was for this that he<br>forbade king Dhritarashtra.[456] In this battle, O slayer of Madhu, many<br>other heroes have been slain by the Kaurava and many amongst the Kauravas<br>have similarly been slain by ourselves. O best of men, for the sake of<br>wealth vile acts are being done. Fie upon that wealth for the sake of<br>which such slaughter of kinsmen is being perpetrated. For him that hath<br>no wealth, even death would be better than the acquisition of wealth by<br>the slaughter of kinsmen. What, O Krishna, shall we gain by slaying our<br>assembled kinsmen? Alas, for Duryodhana's, fault, and also of Sakuni the<br>son of Suvala, as also through the evil counsels of Karna, the Kshatriya<br>race is being exterminated, O slayer of Madhu, I now understand, O<br>mighty-armed one, that the king acted wisely by begging of Suyodhana[457]<br>only half the kingdom, or, instead, only five villages. Alas, even that<br>was not granted by that wicked-souled wight. Beholding so many brave<br>Kshatriyas lying (dead) on the field of battle, I censure myself,<br>(saying) fie upon the profession of a Kshatriya. The Kshatriyas will<br>regard me powerless in battle. For this alone, I am battling. Else, O<br>slayer of Madhu, this battle with kinsmen is distasteful to me. Urge the<br>steeds on with speed towards the Dhartarashtra army, I will, with my two<br>arms, reach the other shore of this ocean of battle that is so difficult<br>to cross. There is no time, O Madhava, to lose in action'. Thus addressed<br>by Partha, Kesava, that slayer of hostile heroes, urged those steeds of<br>white hue endued with the speed of the wind. Then, O Bharata, loud was<br>the noise that was heard among thy troops, resembling that of the ocean<br>itself at full tide when agitated by the tempest.[458] In the afternoon,<br>O king, the battle that ensued between Bhishma and the Pandavas was<br>marked by noise that resembled the roar of the clouds. Then, O king, thy<br>sons, surrounding Drona like the Vasus surrounding Vasava, rushed in the<br>battle against Bhimasena. Then Santanu's son, Bhishma, and that foremost<br>of car-warriors, viz., Kripa, and Bhagadatta, and Susarman, all went<br>towards Dhananjaya. And Hridika's son (Kritavarman) and Valhika rushed<br>towards Satyaki. And king Amvashta placed himself before Abhimanyu. And<br>other great car-warriors, O king, encountered other great car-warriors.<br>Then commenced a fierce battle that was terrible to behold. Bhimasena<br>then, I O king, beholding thy sons, blazed up with wrath in that battle,<br>like fire with (a libation of) clarified butter. Thy sons, however, O<br>monarch, covered that son of Kunti with their arrows like the clouds<br>drenching the mountain-breast in the season of rains. While being (thus)<br>covered in diverse ways by thy sons, O king, that hero, possessed of the<br>activity of the tiger, licked the corners of his mouth.[459] Then, O<br>Bharata, Bhima felled Vyudoroska with a sharp horse-shoe-headed arrow.<br>Thereupon that son of thine was deprived of life. With another<br>broad-headed arrow, well-tempered and sharp, he then felled Kundalin like<br>a lion overthrowing a smaller animal. Then, O sire, getting thy (other)<br>sons (within reach of his arrows), he took up a number of shafts, sharp<br>and well-tempered, and with careful aim speedily shot these at them.<br>Those shafts, sped by that strong bowman, viz., Bhimasena, felled thy<br>sons, those mighty car-warriors, from their vehicles. (These sons of<br>thine that were thus slain were) Anadhriti, and Kundabhedin, and Virata,<br>and Dirghalochana, and Dirghavahu, and Suvahu, and Kanykadhyaja. While<br>falling down (from their cars), O bull of Bharata's race, those heroes<br>looked resplendent like falling mango trees variegated with blossoms in<br>the spring. Then thy other sons, O monarch, fled away, regarding the<br>mighty Bhimasena as Death himself. Then like the clouds pouring torrents<br>of rain on the mountain breast, Drona in that battle covered with arrows<br>from every side that hero who was thus consuming thy sons. The prowess<br>that we then beheld of Kunti's son was exceedingly wonderful, for though<br>held in check by Drona, he still slew thy sons. Indeed, as a bull beareth<br>a shower of rain falling from above. Bhima cheerfully bore that shower of<br>arrows shot by Drona. Wonderful, O monarch, was the feat that Vrikodara<br>achieved there, for he slew thy sons in that battle and resisted Drona<br>the while. Indeed, the elder brother of Arjuna sported amongst those<br>heroic sons o thine, like a mighty tiger, O king, among a herd of deer.<br>As a wolf, staying in the midst of a herd of deer, would chase and<br>frighten those animals, so did Vrikodara, in that battle chase and<br>frighten thy sons.<br><br>"Meanwhile, Ganga's son, and Bhagadatta, and that mighty car-warrior,<br>viz., Gautama, began to resist Arjuna, that impetuous son of Pandu. That<br>Atiratha, baffling with his weapons the weapons of those adversaries of<br>his in that battle, despatched many prominent heroes of thy army to the<br>abode of Death. Abhimanyu also, with his shafts, deprived that renowned<br>and foremost of car-warriors, viz., king Amvashta, of his car. Deprived<br>of his car and about to be slain by the celebrated son of Subhadra, that<br>king quickly jumped down from his car in shame, and hurled his sword in<br>that battle at the high-souled Abhimanyu. Then, that mighty monarch got<br>up on the car of Hridika's son, conversant with all movements in battle,<br>Subhadra's son, that slayer of hostile heroes, beholding that sword<br>coursing towards him, baffled it by the celerity of his movements. Seeing<br>that sword thus baffled in that battle by Subhadra's son, loud cries of<br>'well done' 'well done' were, O king, heard among the troops. Other<br>warriors headed by Dhrishtadyumna battled with thy troops, while thy<br>troops, also, all battled with those of the Pandavas. Then, O Bharata,<br>fierce was the engagement that took place between thine and theirs, that<br>combatants smiting one another with great force and achieving the most<br>difficult feats. Brave combatants, O sire, seizing one another by the<br>hair, fought using their nails and teeth, and fists and knees, and palms<br>and swords, and their well-proportioned arms. And seizing one another's<br>laches, they despatched one another to the abode of Yama. Sire slew son,<br>and son slew sire. Indeed, the combatants fought with one another, using<br>every limb of theirs. Beautiful bows with golden staves, O Bharata,<br>loosened from the grasp of slain warriors, and costly ornaments, and<br>sharp shafts furnished with wings of pure gold or silver and washed with<br>oil, looked resplendent (as they lay scattered on the field), the latter<br>resembling, in particular, snakes that had cast off their slough. And<br>swords furnished with ivory handles decked with gold, and the shield also<br>of bowmen, variegated with gold, lay on the field, loosened from their<br>grasp. Bearded darts and axes and swords and javelins, all decked with<br>gold, beautiful coats of mail, and heavy and short bludgeons, and spiked<br>clubs, and battle-axes, and short arrows, O sire, and elephants' housings<br>of diverse shapes, and yak tails, and fans, lay scattered on the field.<br>And mighty car-warriors lay on the field with diverse kinds of weapons in<br>their hands or beside them, and looking alive, though the breath of life<br>had gone.[460] And men lay on the field with limbs shattered with maces<br>and heads smashed with clubs, or crushed by elephants, steeds, and cars.<br>And the earth, strewn in many places with the bodies of slain steeds,<br>men, and elephants, looked beautiful, O king, as if strewn with hills.<br>And the field of battle lay covered with fallen darts and swords and<br>arrows and lances and scimitars and axes and bearded darts and iron crows<br>and battle-axes, and spiked clubs and short arrows and Sataghnis[461] and<br>bodies mangled with weapons. And, O slayer of foes, covered with blood,<br>warriors lay prostrate on the field, some deprived of life and therefore,<br>in the silence of death, and others uttering low moans. And the earth,<br>strewn with those bodies, presented a variegated sight. And strewn with<br>the arms of strong warriors smeared with sandal paste and decked with<br>leathern fences and bracelets, with tapering thighs resembling the trunks<br>of elephants, and with fallen heads, graced with gems attached to turbans<br>and with earrings of large-eyed combatants, O Bharata, the earth assumed<br>a beautiful sight. And the field of battle, overspread with blood, dyed<br>coats of mail and golden ornaments of many kinds, looked exceedingly<br>beautiful as if with (scattered) fires of mild flames. And with ornaments<br>of diverse kinds fallen off from their places, with bows lying about,<br>with arrows of golden wings scattered around, with many broken cars<br>adorned with rows of bells, with many slain steeds scattered about<br>covered with blood and with their tongues protruding, with bottoms of<br>cars, standards, quivers, and banners, with gigantic conches, belonging<br>to great heroes, of milky whiteness lying about, and with trunkless<br>elephants lying prostrate, the earth looked beautiful like a damsel<br>adorned with diverse kinds of ornaments. And there, with other elephants<br>pierced with lances and in great agony, and frequently uttering low moans<br>with their trunks, the field of battle looked beautiful as if with moving<br>hills. With blankets of diverse hue, and housings of elephants, with<br>beautiful hooks falling about having handles decked with stones of lapis<br>lazuli, with bells lying about that had adorned gigantic elephants, with<br>clean and variegated cloths as also skins of the Ranku deer, with<br>beautiful neck-chains of elephants, with gold-decked girths, with broken<br>engines of diverse kinds, with bearded darts decked with gold, with<br>embroidered housings of steeds, embrowned with dust, with the lopped off<br>arms of cavalry soldiers, decked with bracelets and lying about, with<br>polished and sharp lances and bright swords, with variegated head-gears<br>fallen off (from heads) and scattered about, with beautiful<br>crescent-shaped arrows decked with gold, with housings of steeds, with<br>skins of the Ranku deer, torn and crushed, with beautiful and costly gems<br>that decked the head-gears of kings, with their umbrellas lying about and<br>yak tails and fans, with faces, bright as the lotus or the moon, of<br>heroic warriors, decked with beautiful ear-rings and graced with well-cut<br>beards, lying about and radiant with other ornaments of gold, the earth<br>looked like the firmament besmangled with planets and stars. Thus, O<br>Bharata, the two armies, viz., thine and theirs, encountering each other<br>in battle, crushed each other. And after the combatants had been<br>fatigued, routed, and crushed, O Bharata, dark night set in and the<br>battle could no longer be seen. Thereupon both the Kurus and the Pandavas<br>withdrew their armies, when that awful night of pitchy darkness came. And<br>having withdrawn their troops, both the Kurus and the Pandavas took rest<br>for the night, retiring to their respective tents.
