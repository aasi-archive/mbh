                            [(Bhagavad Gita Chapter XII)]<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'Of those worshippers who, constantly devoted, adore thee,<br>and those who (meditate) on thee as the Immutable and Unmanifest, who are<br>best acquainted with devotion.'<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'Fixing (their) mind on me, they that constantly<br>adore me, being endued (besides) with the highest faith, are deemed by me<br>to be the most devoted. They, however, who worship the Immutable, the<br>Unmanifest, the All-pervading, the Inconceivable, the Indifferent, the<br>Immutable, the Eternal, who, restraining the entire group of the senses,<br>are equal-minded in respect of all around and are engaged in the good of<br>all creatures, (also) attain to me. The trouble is the greater for those<br>whose minds are fixed on the Unmanifest; for the path to the Unmanifest<br>is hard to find by those that are embodied. They (again) who, reposing<br>all action on me (and) regarding me as their highest object (of<br>attainment), worship me, meditating on me with devotion undirected to<br>anything else, of them whose minds are (thus) fixed on me, I, without<br>delay, become the deliverer from the ocean of (this) mortal world. Fix<br>thy heart on me alone, place thy understanding on me, Hereafter then<br>shalt thou dwell in me. (There is) no doubt (in this).[258] If however,<br>thou art unable to fix thy heart steadily on me, then, O Dhananjaya,<br>strive to obtain me by devotion (arising) from continuous application. If<br>thou beest unequal to even (this) continuous application, then let<br>actions performed for me be thy highest aim. Even performing all thy acts<br>for my sake, thou wilt obtain perfection. If even this thou art unable to<br>do, then resorting to devotion in me, (and) subduing thy soul, abandon<br>the fruit of all actions. Knowledge is superior to application (in<br>devotion); meditation is better than knowledge; the abandonment of the<br>fruit of reaction (is better) than meditation, and tranquillity (results)<br>immediately from abandonment. He who hath no hatred for any creature, who<br>is friendly and compassionate also, who is free from egoism, who hath no<br>vanity, attachment, who is alike in pleasure and pain, who is forgiving,<br>contented, always devoted, of subdued, soul, firm of purpose, with heart<br>and understanding fixed on me, even he is dear to me. He through whom the<br>world is not troubled, (and) who is not troubled by the world, who is<br>free from joy, wrath, fear and anxieties, even he is dear to me. That<br>devotee of mine who is unconcerned, pure, diligent, unconnected (with<br>worldly objects), and free from distress (of mind), and who renounceth<br>every action (for fruit), even he is dear to me.[259] He who hath no joy,<br>no aversion, who neither grieveth nor desireth, who renounceth both good<br>and evil, (and) who is full of faith in me, even he is dear to me. He who<br>is alike to friend and foe, as also in honour and dishonour, who is alike<br>in cold and heat, (and pleasure and pain), who is free from attachment,<br>to whom censure and praise are equal, who is taciturn, who is contented<br>with anything that cometh (to him), who is homeless, of steady mind and<br>full of faith, even that man is dear to me. They who resort to this<br>righteousness (leading to) immortality which hath been (already)<br>declared,&#8212;those devotees full of faith and regarding me as the highest<br>object (of their acquisition) are the dearest to me.'
