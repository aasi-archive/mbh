                            Sanjaya said, "Thou hast, O king, in consequence of thy own fault, been<br>overtaken by this calamity. O bull of Bharata's race, the faults which<br>thou, O monarch, hadst seen in that unrighteous course of conduct<br>(towards the Pandavas), were not seen by Duryodhana. It was through thy<br>fault, O king, that the match at dice had taken place. And it is through<br>thy fault that this battle hath taken place with the Pandavas. Having<br>committed a sin, do thou, therefore, reap the fruit of that sin of thine.<br>One reapeth the fruit of acts perpetrated by one's own self. Do thou,<br>therefore, O king, reap the fruit of thy own acts both here and<br>hereafter. Therefore, O monarch, though overtaken by this calamity, be<br>calm still, and listen, O sire, to the (account of the) battle as I<br>recite it.<br><br>"The heroic Bhimasena, having with his sharp shafts broken thy mighty<br>array, then came upon all the younger brothers of Duryodhana. The mighty<br>Bhima, beholding Dussasana and Durvisaha and Dussaha and Durmada and<br>Jaya, and Jayasena and Vikarna and Chitrasena and Sudarsana, and<br>Charuchitra and Suvarman and Duskarna and Karna, and many other mighty<br>car-warriors, excited with rage, of the Dhartarashtra host near enough to<br>himself, penetrated into (thy) mighty array that was protected by Bhishma<br>in that battle. Then, beholding him in their midst, all those warriors<br>said, 'Ye kings, let us take this one's life'!&#8212;Thereupon that son of<br>Pritha was surrounded by those cousins of his who were firmly resolved<br>(to take his life). And Bhima then resembled Surya himself of fierce<br>splendour surrounded by the mighty planets of evil nature, at the time of<br>the universal destruction. And although the son of Pandu was there in the<br>very midst of the (Kaurava) array, yet fear entered not his heart, as it<br>did not that of Indra while surrounded by the Danavas in the fierce<br>battle of old between the celestials and the Asuras. Then thousands of<br>car-warriors armed with all weapons and fully prepared for battle<br>overwhelmed his single self with terrible shafts. Thereupon the heroic<br>Bhima, disregarding the sons of Dhritarashtra, slew in that conflict many<br>foremost warriors (of the Kaurava army) fighting from cars or upon the<br>back of elephants and steeds. And ascertaining the purpose harboured by<br>those cousins of his who were bent upon his destruction, the mighty Bhima<br>set his heart upon slaying them all. Then leaving his car and taking up<br>his mace, the son of Pandu began to smite that very sea of Dhartarashtra<br>troops.<br><br>"Then when Bhimasena thus penetrated the Dhartarashtra host,<br>Dhrishtadyumna the son of Prishata, forsaking Drona (with whom he had<br>been engaged), quickly proceeded to the spot where Suvala's son was<br>stationed. That bull among men, baffling countless warriors of thy army,<br>came upon the empty car of Bhimasena in that battle. And beholding in<br>that conflict Visoka, the charioteer of Bhimasena, Dhrishtadyumna, O<br>king, became exceedingly cheerless and almost deprived of his senses.<br>With voice choked in tears, and sighing as he spoke, he asked Visoka, in<br>grief, saying, 'Where is Bhima who is dear to me as my life itself?'<br>Visoka then, joining his hands, replied unto Dhrishtadyumna saying, 'The<br>mighty son of Pandu, endued with great strength, ordering me to wait for<br>him here, hath alone penetrated into the Dhartarashtra host that<br>resembleth the very ocean. That tiger among men very cheerfully said unto<br>me these words&#8212;'Wait for me, O charioteer, restraining the steeds for a<br>short space of time, that is, till I slay those that are bent upon my<br>destruction.&#8212;Beholding then the mighty Bhima rushing mace in hand, all<br>our troops (that supported him) became filled with delight. Then in this<br>fierce and terrible battle, O prince, thy friend, breaking the mighty<br>array (of the foe), hath penetrated into it. Hearing these words of<br>Visoka, Prishata's son Dhrishtadyumna, endued with great strength, said<br>unto the charioteer these words on the field of battle. 'What need have I<br>today of life itself, if forgetting my affection for the Pandavas, I<br>forsake Bhima in battle? If I return today without Bhima, what will the<br>Kshatriyas say of me? What will they say of me when they will learn that<br>while I was on the field Bhima penetrated alone into the hostile array<br>making a single opening in it? The gods with Indra at their head visit<br>him with evil who, forsaking his comrades in battle, returneth home<br>unhurt! The mighty Bhima again is my friend and kinsman. He is devoted to<br>me, and I also am devoted to that slayer of foes. Therefore, I will go<br>thither, whither Bhima hath gone. Behold me slaying the foe like Vasava<br>slaying the Danavas.' Having said this, the heroic Dhrishtadyumna, O<br>Bharata, proceeded through the midst of the foe, along the tracks opened<br>by Bhimasena and marked by elephants crushed with his mace. He then<br>obtained sight of Bhimasena consuming the hostile ranks or felling<br>Kshatriya warriors like the tempest devastating rows of trees. And<br>car-warriors and horsemen and foot-soldiers and tuskers, while thus<br>slaughtered by him, uttered loud cries of woe. And cries of ah and alas<br>arose from thy troops, O sire, while they were slaughtered by the<br>victorious Bhima accomplished in all moods of warfare. Then the Kaurava<br>warriors all accomplished in arms, surrounding Vrikodara on all sides,<br>fearlessly poured upon him their arrowy showers at the same time. Then<br>the mighty son of Prishata, beholding that foremost of all wielders of<br>weapons, that celebrated hero, viz., the son of Pandu, thus attacked on<br>all sides by fierce ranks of foes in close array, mangled with shafts,<br>treading the field on foot, and vomiting the poison of his wrath, mace in<br>hand and looking like the Destroyer himself at the hour of the universal<br>dissolution, quickly approached him and comforted him by his presence.<br>And taking him upon his car, and plucking the arrows off from all his<br>limbs, and embracing him warmly, the high-souled son of Prishata<br>comforted Bhimasena in the very midst of the foe. Then thy son, in that<br>terrible conflict, quickly coming up to his brothers, said unto them,<br>'This son of Drupada of wicked soul, is now united with Bhimasena. Let us<br>all approach him together for slaying him. Let not the foe seek our ranks<br>(for battle).' Hearing these words, the Dhartarashtras, thus urged on by<br>the command of their eldest brother and unable to put up (with the foe),<br>quickly rushed, with upraised weapons, for slaying Dhrishtadyumna like<br>fierce comets at the hour of the universal dissolution. Taking up their<br>beautiful bows, those heroes, making the very earth shiver with the twang<br>of their bowstring and the rattle of their car-wheels, showered shafts on<br>Drupada's son, like the clouds covering the mountain-breast with torrents<br>of rain. But that hero conversant with all modes of warfare, though thus<br>struck with sharp arrows in that battle, did not waver. On the other<br>hand, that mighty car-warrior, the youthful son of Drupada, beholding<br>those heroic sons of thine staying before him in battle and exerting<br>themselves to their utmost being desirous of slaying them applied that<br>fierce weapon called Pramohana and engaged with thy sons, O king, like<br>Indra with the Danavas in battle. Then those heroic warriors were<br>deprived of their senses, their minds and strength afflicted by the<br>Pramohana weapon. And the Kauravas fled away in all directions, with<br>their steeds and elephants and cars, beholding those sons of thine<br>deprived of their senses in a swoon like those whose hours had come. And<br>at that time Drona, the foremost of all wielders of weapons, approaching<br>Drupada, pierced him with three fierce shafts. And that monarch then, O<br>king, viz., Drupada, deeply pierced by Drona, left the battle, O Bharata,<br>remembering his former hostility (with Bharadwaja's son). Thereupon Drona<br>endued with great prowess having thus vanquished Drupada, blew his conch.<br>And hearing the blare of his conch, all the Somakas were struck with<br>fear. Then Drona, possessed of great energy, that foremost of all<br>wielders of weapons, heard of thy sons being deprived of their senses in<br>battle with the Pramohana weapon. Then the son of Bharadwaja, desirous of<br>rescuing the princes, speedily left that part of the field where he was<br>and proceeded to the place where thy sons were. And that mighty bowman<br>viz., Bharadwaja's son of great prowess, there beheld Dhrishtadyumna and<br>Bhima careering through the field in that dreadful conflict. And that<br>mighty car-warrior beheld thy sons deprived of their senses. Taking up<br>then the weapon called Prajna, he neutralised the Pramohana weapon (that<br>Dhrishtadyumna had shot). Then thy sons those mighty car-warriors, when<br>their senses returned, once more proceeded to battle with Bhima and<br>Prishata's son. Then Yudhishthira, addressing his own troops said, 'Let<br>twelve brave car-warriors cased in mail and headed by Subhadra's son,<br>follow, to the utmost of their might, the track of Bhima and Prishata's<br>son in battle. Let intelligence be had (of those two warriors). My heart<br>is very uneasy.' Thus ordered by the king, those heroes possessed of<br>great prowess in battle and proud of their manliness, saying 'Yes,' all<br>proceeded forward when the sun had reached the meridian. And those<br>chastisers of foes then, viz., the Kaikeyas and the sons of Draupadi, and<br>Dhrishtaketu of great prowess, supported by a large force and with<br>Abhimanyu at their head, and disposing themselves in the array called<br>Suchimukha,[405] penetrated into that car-division of the Dhartarashtras<br>in battle. And thy troops, O king, struck with the fear of Bhimasena and<br>deprived of their senses by Dhrishtadyumna, were unable to resist (the<br>rush of) those mighty bowmen headed by Abhimanyu. And they were quite<br>helpless, like a lady in the streets. And those mighty bowmen with<br>standards variegated with gold cutting through (the Kaurava ranks),<br>proceeded with great speed for rescuing Dhrishtadyumna and Vrikodara. And<br>the latter, beholding those mighty bowmen headed by Abhimanyu, became<br>filled with delight and continued to smite down thy ranks. And the heroic<br>prince of Panchala, viz., the son of Prishata, seeing meanwhile his<br>preceptor advancing towards him with great speed, no longer wished to<br>compass the death of thy sons. Causing Vrikodara then to be taken up on<br>the car of the king of the Kaikeyas, he rushed in great wrath against<br>Drona accomplished in arrow and all weapons. And that slayer of foes,<br>viz., the valiant son of Bharadwaja, excited with rage, cut off with a<br>broad-headed shaft the bow of Prishata's son who was rushing towards him<br>with impetuosity. And remembering the bread he had eaten of his master<br>and desirous of doing good to Duryodhana, he also sped hundreds of shafts<br>after Prishata's son. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son<br>of Prishata, taking up another bow, pierced Drona with seventy shafts<br>whetted on stone and furnished with wings of gold. Then that grinder of<br>foes, viz., Drona, once more cut off his bow, and despatched his four<br>steeds to Yama's abode with four excellent arrows, and also slew his<br>charioteer, O Bharata, with a broad-headed shaft. Then that mighty<br>car-warrior of strong arms, viz., Dhrishtadyumna, quickly descending from<br>that car whose steeds had been slain, ascended the great car of<br>Abhimanyu. Then Drona caused the Pandava army consisting of cars,<br>elephants, and steeds, to tremble, in the very sight of Bhimasena and the<br>intelligent son of Prishata. Beholding then that army thus broken by<br>Drona of immeasurable energy, all those mighty car-warriors were<br>incapable of checking its flight. And that army, thus slaughtered by<br>Drona with his sharp shafts, began to move in eddies there, like the<br>agitated sea. And beholding the (Pandava) army in that condition, thy<br>troops were filled with delight. And seeing the preceptor excited with<br>rage and thus consuming the ranks of the foe, all thy warriors, O<br>Bharata, set up loud shouts and uttered exclamations in praise of Drona."
