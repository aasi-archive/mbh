                            [(Bhagavad Gita, Chapter XVIII)]<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'Of renunciation, O thou of mighty arms, I desire to know<br>the true nature, and also of abandonment, O lord of the senses<br>distinctly, O slayer of Kesi.'[293]<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'The rejection of the works with desire is known by<br>the learned as renunciation. The abandonment of the fruit of all work,<br>the discerning call abandonment. Some wise men say that work (itself)<br>should be abandoned as evil; others (say) that the works of sacrifice,<br>gifts, and penance, should not be abandoned. As to that abandonment,<br>listen to my decision, O best of the sons of Bharata, for abandonment, O<br>tiger among men, hath been declared to be of three kinds. The works of<br>sacrifice, gifts, and penance should not be abandoned. They should,<br>indeed, be done. Sacrifice, gift, and penance, are the purifications of<br>the wise. But even those works should be done, abandoning attachment and<br>fruit. This, O son of Pritha, is my excellent and decided opinion. The<br>renunciation of an act prescribed (in the scriptures) is not proper. Its<br>abandonment (is) from delusion, (and) is (therefore,) declared to be of<br>the quality of darkness.[294] (Regarding it) as (a source of) sorrow,<br>when work is abandoned from (fear of) bodily pain, one making such an<br>abandonment which is of the quality of passion never obtaineth the fruit<br>of abandonment. (Regarding it) as one that should be done, when[295] work<br>that is prescribed (in the scriptures) is done, O Arjuna, abandoning<br>attachment and fruit also, that abandonment is deemed to be of the<br>quality of goodness. Possessed of intelligence and with doubts dispelled,<br>an abandoner that is endowed with the quality of goodness hath no<br>aversion for an unpleasant action and no attachment to pleasant<br>(ones).[296] Since actions cannot be absolutely abandoned by an embodied<br>person, (therefore) he who abandons the fruit of actions is truly said to<br>be an abandoner. Evil, good and mixed-action hath (this) three-fold fruit<br>hereafter for those that do not abandon. But there is none whatever for<br>the renouncer.[297] Listen from me, O thou of mighty arms, to those five<br>causes for the completion of all actions, declared in the Sankhya<br>treating of the annihilation of actions.[298] (They are) substratum,<br>agent, the diverse kinds of organs, the diverse efforts severally, and<br>with them the deities as the fifth.[299] With body, speech, or mind,<br>whatever work, just or the reverse, a man undertakes, these five are its<br>causes. That being so, he that, owing to an unrefined understanding,<br>beholdeth his own self as solely the agent, he, dull in mind, beholdeth<br>not. He that hath no feeling of egoism, whose mind is not sullied, he,<br>even killing all these people, killeth not, nor is fettered (by<br>action).[300]&#8212;Knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower, form<br>the three-fold impulse of action. Instrument, action, and the agent, form<br>the three-fold complement of action.[301] Knowledge, action, and agent,<br>are declared in the enumeration of qualities to be three-fold, according<br>to the difference of qualities. Listen to those also duly.[302] That by<br>which One Eternal Essence is viewed in all things, undivided in the<br>divided, know that to be knowledge having the quality of goodness. That<br>knowledge which discerneth all things as diverse essences of different<br>kinds in consequence of their separateness, know that that knowledge hath<br>the quality of passion. But that which is attached to (each) single<br>object as if it were the whole, which is without reason, without truth,<br>and mean, that knowledge hath been said to be of the quality of darkness.<br>The action which is prescribed (by the scriptures), (done) without<br>attachment, performed without desires and aversion, by one who longeth<br>not for (its) fruit, is said to be of the quality of goodness. But that<br>action which is done by one seeking objects of desire, or by one filled<br>with egoism, and which is attended with great trouble, is said to be of<br>the quality of passion. That action which is undertaken from delusion,<br>without regard to consequences, loss, injury (to others), and (one's own)<br>power also, is said to be of the quality of passion. The agent who is<br>free from attachment, who never speaketh of himself, who is endued with<br>constancy and energy, and is unmoved by success and defeat, is said to be<br>of the quality of goodness. The agent who is full of affections, who<br>wisheth for the fruit of actions, who is covetous, endued with cruelty,<br>and impure, and who feeleth joy and sorrow, is declared to be of the<br>quality of passion.[303] The agent who is void of application, without<br>discernment, obstinate, deceitful, malicious, slothful, desponding, and<br>procrastinating, is said to be of the quality of darkness.[304] Hear now,<br>O Dhananjaya, the three-fold division of intellect and constancy,<br>according to their qualities, which I am about to declare exhaustively<br>and distinctly. The intellect which knoweth action and inaction, what<br>ought to be done and what ought not to be done, fear and fearlessness,<br>bondage and deliverance, is, O son of Pritha, of the quality of goodness.<br>The intellect by which one imperfectly discerneth right and wrong, that<br>which ought to be done and that which ought not to be done, is, O son of<br>Pritha, of the quality of passion. That intellect which, shrouded by<br>darkness, regardeth wrong to be right, and all things as reversed, is, O<br>son of Pritha, of the quality of darkness. That unswerving constancy by<br>which one controls the functions of the mind, the life-breaths, and the<br>senses, through devotion, that constancy, is, O son of Pritha, of the<br>quality of goodness.[305] But that constancy, O Arjuna, by which one<br>holds to religion, desire, and profit, through attachment, desiring<br>fruit, that constancy, O son of Pritha, is of the quality of passion.<br>That through which an undiscerning person abandons not sleep, fear,<br>sorrow, despondency, and folly, that constancy is deemed to be of the<br>quality of darkness. Hear now from me, O bull of Bharata's race, of the<br>three kinds of happiness. That in which one findeth pleasure from<br>repetition (of enjoyment), which bringeth an end to pain, which is like<br>poison first but resembleth nectar in the end, that happiness born of the<br>serenity produced by a knowledge of self, is said to be of the quality of<br>goodness.[306] That which is from the contact of the senses with their<br>objects which resembleth nectar first but is like poison in the end, that<br>happiness is held to be of the quality of passion. That happiness which<br>in the beginning and its consequences deludeth the soul, and springeth<br>from sleep, indolence, and stupidity, that is described to be of the<br>quality of darkness. There is not, either on earth or heaven among the<br>gods, the entity that is free from these three qualities born of nature.<br>The duties of Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas, and of Sudras also, O<br>chastiser of foes, are distinguished by (these three) qualities born of<br>nature. Tranquillity, self-restraint, ascetic austerities, purity,<br>forgiveness, rectitude, knowledge, experience, and belief (in an<br>existence hereafter),&#8212;these are the duties of Brahmanas, born of (their<br>proper) nature. Bravery, energy, firmness, skill, not flying away from<br>battle, liberality, the bearing of a ruler,&#8212;these are the duties of<br>Kshatriyas, born of (their proper) nature. Agriculture, tending of<br>cattle, and trade, are the natural duties of Vaisyas. Of Sudras also, the<br>natural duty consists in servitude. Every man, engaged in his own duties,<br>attains to perfection. Hear now how one obtains perfection by application<br>to his duties. Him from whom are the movements of all beings, Him by whom<br>all this is pervaded, worshipping him by (the performance of) one's own<br>duty, one obtaineth perfection. Better is one's own duty though performed<br>faultily than another's duty well-performed. Performing the duty<br>prescribed by (one's own) nature, one incurreth no sin. One must not<br>abandon, O son of Kunti, one's natural duty though tainted with evil, for<br>all actions are enveloped by evil like fire by smoke. He whose mind is<br>unattached everywhere, who hath subdued his self, and whose desire hath<br>departed, obtaineth, through renunciation, the supreme perfection of<br>freedom from work. Learn from me, only in brief, O son of Kunti, how one,<br>having obtained (this kind of) perfection, attaineth to Brahma which is<br>the supreme end of knowledge. Endued with a pure mind, and restraining<br>his self by constancy, renouncing sound and other objects of sense, and<br>casting off affection and aversion, he who resideth in a lonely place,<br>eateth little, and restraineth speech, body, and mind, who is ever intent<br>on meditation and abstraction, who hath recourse to indifference, who,<br>abandoning egoism, violence, pride, lust, wrath, and (all) surroundings,<br>hath been freed from selfishness and is tranquil (in mind), becometh fit<br>for assimilation with Brahma. Becoming one with Brahma, tranquil in<br>spirit, (such a) one grieveth not, desireth not; alike to all beings, he<br>obtaineth the highest devotion to Me. By (that) devotion he truly<br>understandeth Me. What I am, and who I am; then understanding Me truly,<br>he entereth into Me forthwith. Even performing all actions at all times<br>having refuge in Me, he obtaineth, through my favour, the seat that is<br>eternal and imperishable. Dedicating in thy heart all actions to Me,<br>being devoted to Me, resorting to mental abstraction, fix thy thoughts<br>constantly on Me. Fixing thy thoughts on Me, thou wilt surmount all<br>difficulties through my grace. But if from self-conceit thou wilt not<br>listen, thou wilt (then) utterly perish. If, having recourse to<br>self-conceit, thou thinkest&#8212;I will not fight,&#8212;that resolution of thine<br>would be vain, (for) Nature will constrain thee. That which, from<br>delusion, thou dost not wish to do, thou wilt do involuntarily, bound by<br>thy own duty springing from (thy own) nature. The Lord, O Arjuna,<br>dwelleth in the region of the heart of beings, turning all beings as if<br>mounted on a machine, by his illusive power. Seek shelter with Him in<br>every way, O Bharata. Through his grace thou wilt obtain supreme<br>tranquillity, the eternal seat. Thus hath been declared to thee by Me the<br>knowledge that is more mysterious than any (other) matter. Reflecting on<br>it fully, act as thou likest. Once more, listen to my supernal words, the<br>most mysterious of all. Exceedingly dear art thou to Me, therefore, I<br>will declare what is for thy benefit. Set thy heart on Me, become My<br>devotee, sacrifice to Me, bow down to Me. Then shalt thou come to Me. I<br>declare to thee truly, (for) thou art dear to Me. Forsaking all<br>(religious) duties, come to Me as thy sole refuge. I will deliver thee<br>from all sins. Do not grieve. This is not to be ever declared by thee to<br>one who practiseth no austerities, to one who is not a devotee, to one<br>who never waiteth on a preceptor, nor yet to one who calumniateth Me. He<br>who shall inculcate this supreme mystery to those that are devoted to Me,<br>offering Me the highest devotion, will come to Me, freed from (all his)<br>doubts.[307] Amongst men there is none who can do Me a dearer service<br>than he, nor shall any other on earth be dearer to Me than he. And he who<br>will study this holy converse between us, by him will have been offered<br>to Me the sacrifice of knowledge. Such is my opinion. Even the man who,<br>with faith and without cavil, will hear it (read), even he freed (from<br>re-birth), will obtain of the blessed regions of those that perform pious<br>acts. Hath this, O son of Pritha, been heard by thee with mind undirected<br>to any other objects? Hath thy delusion, (caused) by ignorance, been<br>destroyed, O Dhananjaya?'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'My delusion hath been destroyed, and the recollection (of<br>what I am) hath been gained by me, O Undeteriorating one, through thy<br>favour. I am now firm. My doubts have been dispelled. I will do thy<br>bidding.'"<br><br>Sanjaya continued, "Thus I heard this converse between Vasudeva and the<br>high-souled son of Pritha, (that is) wonderful and causeth the hair to<br>stand on end. Through Vyasa's favour heard I this supreme mystery, this<br>(doctrine of) Yoga, from Krishna himself, the Lord of Yoga, who declared<br>it in person. O King recollecting and (again) recollecting this wonderful<br>(and) holy converse of Kesava and Arjuna, I rejoice over and over again.<br>Recollecting again and again that wonderful form also of Hari, great is<br>my amazement, O king, and I rejoice ever more. Thither where Krishna, the<br>Lord of Yoga (is), thither where the great bowman (Partha) is, thither,<br>in my opinion, are prosperity, and victory, and greatness, and eternal<br>justice[308]'"<br><br>[End of the Bhagavad Gita]
