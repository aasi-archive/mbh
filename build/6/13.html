                            (Bhagavat-Gita Parva)<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Possessing a knowledge of the past, the present and<br>the future, and seeing all things as if present before his eyes, the<br>learned son of Gavalgana, O Bharata, coming quickly from the field of<br>battle, and rushing with grief (into the court) represented unto<br>Dhritarashtra who was plunged in thought that Bhishma the grandsire of<br>the Bharatas had been slain."<br><br>"Sanjaya said,&#8212;'I am Sanjaya, O great king. I bow to thee, O bull of<br>Bharata's race. Bhishma, the son of Santanu and the grandsire of the<br>Bharatas, hath been slain. That foremost of all warriors, that grandsire<br>of the Bharatas, hath been slain. That foremost of all warriors, that<br>embodied energy of all bowmen, that grandsire of the Kurus lieth to-day<br>on a bed of arrows. That Bhishma. O king, relying on whose energy thy son<br>had been engaged in that match at dice, now lieth on the field of battle<br>slain by Sikhandin. That mighty car-warrior who on a single car had<br>vanquished in terrific combat at the city of Kasi all the kings of the<br>Earth mustered together, he who had fearlessly fought in battle with<br>Rama, the son of Jamadagni, he whom Jamadagni's son could not slay, oh,<br>even hath he been to-day slain by Sikhandin. Resembling the great Indra<br>himself in bravery, and Himavat in firmness, like unto the ocean itself<br>in gravity, and the Earth herself in patience, that invincible warrior<br>having arrows for his teeth, that bow for his mouth, and the sword for<br>his tongue, that lion among men, hath to-day been slain by the prince of<br>Panchala. That slayer of heroes, beholding whom when addrest for battle<br>the mighty army of the Pandavas, unmanned by fear, used to tremble like a<br>herd of kine when beholding a lion, alas, having protected that army (of<br>thine) for ten nights and having achieved feats exceedingly difficult of<br>accomplishment, hath set like the Sun.[78] He who like Sakra himself,<br>scattering arrows in thousands with the utmost composure, daily slew ten<br>thousand warriors for ten days, even he slain (by the enemy), lieth,<br>though he deserveth it not, on the bare ground like a (mighty) tree<br>broken by the wind, in consequence, O king, of thy evil counsels, O<br>Bharata.'"
