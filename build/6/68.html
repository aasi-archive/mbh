                            "Bhishma said, 'Hear from me, O king, this hymn that was uttered by<br>Brahman himself. This hymn was in days of old communicated by regenerate<br>Rishis and the gods (to men) on Earth-Narada described thee as the Master<br>and the Lord of the god of gods and all the Sadhyas and the celestials,<br>and as one acquainted with the nature of the Creator of the worlds.<br>Markandeya spoke of thee as the Past, the Present, and the Future, and<br>the sacrifice of sacrifices, and the austerity of austerities. The<br>illustrious Bhrigu said of thee that thou art the God of the gods, that<br>thine is the ancient form of Vishnu. Dwaipayana said of thee that thou<br>art Vasudeva of the Vasus, the establisher of Sakra, and the God of gods<br>and all creatures. In days of old on the occasion of procreating<br>creatures, the sages spoke of thee as Daksha, the Father of creation.<br>Angiras said that thou art the creator of all beings. Devala said of thee<br>that the unmanifest all is thy body, and the manifest is in thy mind, and<br>that the gods are all the result of thy breath.[389] With thy heads is<br>pervaded the heavens, and thy two arms support the Earth. In thy stomach<br>are three worlds and thou art the Eternal Being. Even thus do men exalted<br>by asceticism know thee. Thou art the Sat of Sat, with Rishis gratified<br>with sight of Self.[390] With royal sages of liberal minds, never<br>retreating from battle and having morality for their highest end, thou, O<br>slayer of Madhu, art, the sole refuse. Even thus is that illustrious and<br>Supreme Being, viz., Hari, adored and worshipped by Sanatkumar and other<br>ascetics endued with Yoga. The truth about Kesava, O sire, is now<br>narrated to thee, both in brief and detail. Turn thy heart in love to<br>Kesava.'"<br><br>Sanjaya continued, "Hearing this sacred story, thy son, O great king,<br>began to regard highly both Kesava and these mighty car-warriors, viz.,<br>the sons of Pandu. Then, O monarch, Bhishma the son of Santanu once more<br>addressed thy son, saying, 'Thou hast now heard truly, O king, about the<br>glory of the high-souled Kesava and of Nara about which thou hadst asked<br>me. Thou hast also heard about the object for which both Nara and<br>Narayana have taken their births among men. Thou hast also been told the<br>reason why those heroes are invincible and have never been vanquished in<br>battle, and why also, O king, the sons of Pandu are incapable of being<br>slain in battle, by anybody. Krishna beareth great love for the<br>illustrious sons of Pandu. It is for this, O king of kings, that I say,<br>'Let peace be made with the Pandavas.' Restraining thy passions enjoy<br>thou the Earth with thy mighty brothers (around thee). By disregarding<br>the divine Nara and Narayana, thou shalt certainly be destroyed. Having<br>said these words, thy sire, became silent, O monarch, and dismissing the<br>king, entered his tent. And the king also came back to his (own) tent,<br>having worshipped the illustrious grandsire. And then, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, he laid himself down on his white bed for passing the<br>night in sleep."
