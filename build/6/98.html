                            Sanjaya said, "Then king Duryodhana, and Sakuni the son of Suvala, and<br>thy son Dussasana, and the invincible Suta's son (Karna) meeting<br>together, consulted in the following way. How could the sons of Pandu,<br>with their followers, be vanquished in battle? Even this was the subject<br>of their consultation. Then king Duryodhana, addressing the Suta's son<br>and the mighty Sakuni, said unto all those counsellors of his, 'Drona,<br>Bhishma, and Kripa, and Salya and Somadatta's son do not resist the<br>Parthas. I do not know what the cause is of such conduct (of theirs).<br>Unslain by any of these, the Pandavas are destroying my forces.<br>Therefore, O Karna, I am becoming weaker in strength and my weapons also<br>are being exhausted'. I am deceived by the heroic Pandavas&#8212;they that are<br>incapable of being vanquished by the very gods. Doubt filleth my mind as<br>to how, indeed, I shall succeed is smiting them in battle.' Unto the king<br>who said so, O great monarch, the Suta's son answered, 'Do not grieve, O<br>chief of the Bharata. Even I will do what is agreeable to thee. Let<br>Santanu's son Bhishma soon withdraw from the great battle. After Ganga's<br>son will have withdrawn from the fight and laid aside his weapons, I will<br>slay the Partha along with all the Somakas, in the very sight of Bhishma.<br>I pledge my truth, O king. Indeed, Bhishma every day showeth mercy<br>towards the Pandavas. He is, besides incapable of vanquishing those<br>mighty car-warriors. Bhishma is proud of showing his prowess in battle.<br>He is again, very fond of fight. Why, O sire, will he, therefore,<br>vanquish the assembled Pandavas (for then the battle will be over)?<br>Therefore, repairing without delay to the tent of Bhishma, solicit that<br>old and reverend signior to lay aside his weapons. After he will have<br>laid aside his weapons, O Bharata, think the Pandavas as already slain,<br>with all their friends and kinsmen, O king, by myself alone.' Thus<br>addressed by Karna, thy son Duryodhana then said unto his brother<br>Dussasana these words, 'See, O Dussasana, that without delay that all who<br>walk in my train be dressed.' Having said these words, O monarch, the<br>king addressed Karna, saying, 'Having caused Bhishma, that foremost of<br>men, to consent to this, I will, without delay, come to thee, O chastiser<br>of foes. After Bhishma will have retired from the fight, thou wilt smite<br>(the foe) in battle'. Then thy son, O monarch, set out without delay,<br>accompanied by his brothers like He of a hundred sacrifices (accompanied)<br>by the gods. Then his brother Dussasana caused that tiger among king,<br>endued, besides, with the prowess of a tiger, to mount on his horse.<br>Graced with bracelets, with diadem on head, and adorned with other<br>ornaments on his arms. O king, thy son shone brightly as he proceeded<br>along the streets. Smeared with fragrant sandal-paste of the hue of the<br>Bhandi flower and bright as burnished gold, and clad in clean vestments,<br>and proceeding with the sportive gait of the lion, Duryodhana looked<br>beautiful like the Sun of brilliant radiance in the firmament. And as<br>that tiger among men proceeded towards the tent of Bhishma, many mighty<br>bowmen, celebrated over the world, followed him behind. And his brothers<br>also walked in his train, like the celestials walking behind Vasava. And<br>others, foremost of men, mounted upon steeds, and others again on<br>elephants, O Bharata, and others on cars, surrounded him on all sides.<br>And many amongst those that wished him well, taking up arms for the<br>protection on his royal self, appeared there in large bodies, like the<br>celestials surrounding Sakra in heaven. The mighty chief of the Kurus,<br>adored by all the Kauravas, thus proceeded, O king, towards the quarters<br>of the renowned son of Ganga. Ever followed and surrounded, by his<br>uterine brothers, he proceeded, often raising his right arm, massive and<br>resembling the trunk of an elephant and capable of resisting all foes.<br>And with that arm of his, he accepted the regards that were paid to him<br>from all sides by by-standers who stood raising towards him their joined<br>hands. And he heard, as he journeyed, the sweet voices of the natives of<br>diverse realms. Of great fame, he was eulogised by bards and eulogists.<br>And in return that great king paid his regards unto them all. And many<br>high-souled persons stood around him with lighted lamps of gold fed with<br>fragrant oil. And surrounded with golden lamps, the king looked radiant<br>like the Moon attended by the blazing planets around him. And<br>(attendants) with head-gears decked with gold, having canes and<br>Jhariharas in hand, softly caused the crowd all around to make way. The<br>king then, having reached the excellent quarters of Bhishma, alighted<br>from his horse. And arrived at Bhishma's presence, that ruler of men<br>saluted Bhishma and then sat himself down on an excellent seat that was<br>made of gold, beautiful throughout and overlaid with a rich coverlet.<br>With hands joined, eyes bathed in tears, and voice chocked in grief, he<br>then addressed Bhishma, saying, 'Taking thy protection, this battle, O<br>slayer of foes, we ventured to vanquish the very gods and the Asuras with<br>Indra at their head. What shall I say, therefore, of the sons of Pandu,<br>heroic though they be, with their kinsmen and friends? Therefore, O son<br>of Ganga, it behoveth thee, O lord, to show me mercy. Slay the brave sons<br>of Pandu like Mahendra slaying the Danavas.&#8212;I will slay, O king, all the<br>Somakas and the Panchalas and the Karushas along with the Kekayas, O<br>Bharata-these were thy words to me. Let these words become true. Slay the<br>assembled Parthas, and those mighty bowmen, viz., the Somakas. Make thy<br>words true, O Bharata. If from kindness (for the Pandavas), O king, or<br>from thy hatred of my unfortunate self, thou sparest the Pandavas, then<br>permit Karna, that ornament of battle, to fight. He will vanquish in<br>battle the Parthas with all their friends and kinsmen. The king, thy son<br>Duryodhana having said this, shut his lips without saying anything more<br>to Bhishma of terrible prowess."
