                            (Bhumi Parva)<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;'Thou hast, O Sanjaya, duly described Jamvukhanda<br>to me. Tell me now its dimensions and extent truly. Tell me also, O<br>Sanjaya, of the extent of the ocean of Sakadwipa, and Kusadwipa, of<br>Salmalidwipa and Kraunchadwipa, truly and without leaving anything and<br>tell me also, O son of Gavalgani, of Rahu and Soma and Surya.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said,&#8212;'There are, O king, many islands, over which the Earth<br>extended. I will describe to thee, however, only seven islands, and the<br>moon, and the sun, and the planet (Rahu), also. The Jamvu mountain, O<br>king, extends over full eighteen thousand and six hundred Yojanas. The<br>extent of the salt ocean is said to be twice this. That ocean is covered<br>with many kingdoms, and is adorned with gems and corals. It is, besides,<br>decked with many mountains that are variegated with metals of diverse<br>kinds. Thickly peopled by Siddhas and Charanas, the ocean is circular in<br>form.<br><br>"I will now tell thee truly of Sakadwipa, O Bharata. Listen to me, O son<br>of Kuru's race, as I describe it to thee duly. That island, O ruler of<br>men, is of twice the extent of Jamvudwipa. And the ocean also, O great<br>king, is of twice the extent of that island. Indeed, O best of the<br>Bharatas, Sakadwipa is surrounded on all sides by the ocean. The kingdoms<br>there are full of righteousness, and the men there never die. How can<br>famine take place there? The people are all endued with forgiveness and<br>great energy. I have now, O bull of Bharata's race, given thee duly a<br>brief description of Sakadwipa. What else, O king, dost thou wish to<br>hear?'"[66]<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;'Thou hast given me, O Sanjaya, a description of<br>Sakadwipa in brief. O thou that art possessed of great wisdom, tell me<br>now everything in detail truly.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said,&#8212;'In that island, O king, there are seven mountains that<br>are decked with jewels and that are mines of gems, precious stones. There<br>are many rivers also in that island. Listen to me as I recount their<br>names. Everything there, O king, is excellent and delightful, The first<br>of these mountains is called Meru. It is the abode of the gods, Rishis,<br>and Gandharvas. The next mountain, O king, is called Malaya stretching<br>towards the east. It is there that the clouds are generated and it is<br>thence that they disperse on all sides. The next, O thou of Kuru's race,<br>is the large mountain called Jaladhara.[67] Thence Indra daily taketh<br>water of the best quality. It is from that water that we get showers in<br>the season of rains, O ruler of men. Next cometh the high mountain called<br>Raivataka, over which, in the firmament, hath been permanently placed the<br>constellation called Revati. This arrangement hath been made by the<br>Grandsire himself. On the north of this, O great king, is the large<br>mountain called Syama. It hath the splendour of newly-risen clouds, is<br>very high, beautiful and of bright body. And since the hue of those<br>mountains is dark, the people residing there are all dark in complexion,<br>O king.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;'A great doubt ariseth in my mind, O Sanjaya, from<br>what thou hast said. Why, O Suta's son, would the people there be of dark<br>complexion?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said,&#8212;'O great king, in all islands, O son of Kuru's race, men<br>may be found that are fair, and those that are dark, and those also that<br>are produced by a union of the fair and the dark races. But because the<br>people there are all dark, therefore is that mountain called the Dark<br>Mountain. After this, O chief of the Kurus, is the large mountain called<br>Durgasaila. And then cometh the mountain called Kesari. The breezes that<br>blow from that mountain are all charged with (odoriferous) effluvia. The<br>measure of each of these mountains is double that of the one mentioned<br>immediately before. O thou of Kuru's race, it hath been said by the wise<br>that there are seven Varshas in that island. The Varsha of Meru is called<br>Mahakasa; that of the water-giving (Malaya) is called Kumudottara. The<br>Varsha of Jaladhara is called Sukumara: while that of Raivatak is called<br>Kaumara; and of Syama, Manikanchana. The Varsha of Kesara is called<br>Mandaki, and that called after the next mountain is called Mahapuman. In<br>the midst of that island is a large tree called Saka. In height and<br>breadth the measure of that tree is equal to that of the Jamvu tree in<br>Jamvudwipa. And the people there always adore that tree. There in that<br>island are, many delightful provinces where Siva is worshipped, and<br>thither repair the Siddhas, the Charanas, and the celestials. The people<br>there, O king, are virtuous, and all the four orders, O Bharata, are<br>devoted to their respective occupation. No instance of theft can be seen<br>there. Freed from decrepitude and death and gifted with long life, the<br>people there, O king, grow like rivers during the season of rains. The<br>rivers there are full of sacred water, and Ganga herself, distributed as<br>she hath been into various currents, is there, Sukumari, and Kumari, and<br>Seta, and Keveraka, and Mahanadi, O Kauravya, and the river Manijala, and<br>Chakshus, and the river Vardhanika, O thou best of the Bharatas,&#8212;these<br>and many other rivers by thousands and hundreds, all full of sacred<br>water, are there, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, from which Vasava draweth<br>water for showering it as rain. It is impossible to recount the names and<br>lengths of rivers. All of them are foremost of rivers and sin-cleansing.<br>As heard by all men there, in that island of Saka, are four sacred<br>provinces. They are the Mrigas, the Masakas, the Manasas, and the<br>Mandagas. The Mrigas for the most part are Brahmanas devoted to the<br>occupations of their order. Amongst the Masakas are virtuous Kshatriyas<br>granting (unto Brahmanas) every wish (entertained by them). The Manasas,<br>O king, live by following the duties of the Vaisya order. Having every<br>wish of theirs gratified, they are also brave and firmly devoted to<br>virtue and profit. The Mandagas are all brave Sudras of virtuous<br>behaviour. In these provinces, O monarch, there is no king, no<br>punishment, no person that deserves to be punished. Conversant with the<br>dictates of duty they are all engaged in the practice of their respective<br>duties and protect one another. This much is capable of being said of the<br>island called Saka. This much also should be listened to about that<br>island endued with great energy."[68]
