                            Sanjaya said, "Beholding his own troops slain, king Duryodhana then<br>excited with wrath, rushed towards Bhimasena, that chastiser of foes.<br>Taking up a large bow whose effulgence resembled that of Indra's bolt, he<br>covered the son of Pandu with a thick shower of arrows. And filled with<br>rage, and aiming a sharp crescent-shaped shaft winged with feathers, he<br>cut off Bhimasena's bow. And that mighty car-warrior, noticing an<br>opportunity, quickly aimed at his adversary a whetted shaft capable of<br>riving the very hills. With that (shaft), that mighty-armed (warrior)<br>struck Bhimasena in the chest. Deeply pierced with that arrow, and<br>exceedingly pained, and licking the corners of his mouth, Bhimasena of<br>great energy caught hold of his flag-staff decked with gold. Beholding<br>Bhimasena in that cheerless state, Ghatotkacha blazed up with wrath like<br>an all-consuming conflagration. Then many mighty car-warriors of the<br>Pandava army, headed by Abhimanyu and with wrath generated (in their<br>bosoms), rushed at the king shouting loudly. Beholding them (thus)<br>advancing (to the fight) filled with wrath and in great fury,<br>Bharadwaja's son addressing the mighty car-warriors (of thy side), said<br>these words,&#8212;'Go quickly, blessed be ye, and protect the king. Sinking<br>in an ocean of distress, he is placed in a situation of great danger.<br>These mighty car-warriors of the Pandava army, these great bowmen,<br>placing Bhimasena at their head, are rushing towards Duryodhana, shooting<br>and hurling diverse kinds of weapons, resolved upon winning success,<br>uttering terrible shouts, and frightening the kings (on your side)'.<br>Hearing these words of the preceptor, many warriors of thy side headed by<br>Somadatta rushed upon the Pandava ranks. Kripa and Bhurisravas and Salya,<br>and Drona's son and Vivingsati, and Chitrasena and Vikarna, and the ruler<br>of the Sindhus, and Vrihadvala, and those two mighty bowmen, viz., the<br>two princes of Avanti, surrounded the Kuru king. Advancing only twenty<br>steps, the Pandavas and the Dhartarashtras began to strike, desirous of<br>slaughtering each other. The mighty-armed son of Bharadwaja also, having<br>said those words (unto the Dhartarashtra warriors), stretched his own<br>large bow and pierced Bhima with six and twenty arrows. And once again<br>that mighty car-warrior speedily covered Bhimasena with a shower of<br>arrows like a mass of clouds dropping torrents of rain on the<br>mountain-breasts in the rainy season. That mighty bowman Bhimasena,<br>however, of great strength, speedily pierced him in return with ten<br>shafts on the left side. Deeply pierced with those arrows and exceedingly<br>pained, O Bharata, the preceptor, enfeebled as he is with age, suddenly<br>sat down on the terrace of his car, deprived of consciousness. Beholding<br>him thus pained, king Duryodhana himself, and Aswatthaman also, excited<br>with wrath, both rushed towards Bhimasena. Beholding those two warriors<br>advance, each like Yama as he shows himself at the end of the Yuga, the<br>mighty-armed Bhimasena, quickly taking up a mace, and jumping down from<br>his car without loss of time, stood immovable like a hill, with that<br>heavy mace resembling the very club of Yama, upraised in battle.<br>Beholding him with mace (thus) upraised and looking (on that account)<br>like the crested Kailasa, both the Kuru king and Drona's son rushed<br>towards him. Then the mighty Bhimasena himself rushed impetuously at<br>those two foremost of men thus rushing together towards him with great<br>speed. Beholding him thus rushing in fury and with terrible expression of<br>face, many mighty car-warriors of the Kaurava army speedily proceeded<br>towards him. Those car-warriors headed by Bharadwaja's son, impelled by<br>the desire of slaughtering Bhimasena, hurled at his breast diverse kinds<br>of weapons, and thus all of them together afflicted Bhima from all sides.<br>Beholding that mighty car-warrior thus afflicted and placed in a<br>situation of great peril, many mighty car-warriors of the Pandava army,<br>headed by Abhimanyu, and prepared to lay down dear life itself, rushed to<br>the spot, desirous of rescuing him. The heroic ruler of the low country,<br>the dear friend of Bhima, viz., Nila, looking like a mass of blue clouds,<br>rushed at Drona's son, filled with wrath. A great bowman, Nila always<br>desired an encounter with Drona's son. Drawing his large bow, he pierced<br>the son of Drona with many winged arrows, like Sakra in days of old, O<br>king, piercing the invincible Danava Viprachitti, that terror of the<br>celestials, who, moved by anger frightened the three worlds by his<br>energy. Pierced after the same way by Nila with his well-shot arrows<br>winged with feathers, Drona's son, covered with blood and exceedingly<br>pained, was filled with wrath. Drawing then his large bow, of twang loud<br>as the roar of Indra's thunder, that foremost of intelligent persons set<br>his heart upon the destruction of Nila. Aiming then a few bright shafts<br>of broad heads and sharpened by the hands of their forger, he slew the<br>four steeds of his adversary and overthrew also his standard. And with<br>the seventh shaft he pierced Nila himself in the chest. Deeply pierced<br>and exceedingly pained, he sat down on the terrace of his car. Beholding<br>king Nila, who looked like a mass of blue clouds, in a swoon,<br>Ghatotkacha, filled with wrath and surrounded by his kinsmen, rushed<br>impetuously towards Drona's son, that ornament of battle. Similarly many<br>other Rakshasas, incapable of being easily defeated in battle, rushed at<br>Aswatthaman. Beholding then that Rakshasa of terrible mien coming towards<br>him, the valiant son of Bharadwaja impetuously rushed towards him. Filled<br>with wrath he slew many Rakshasas of formidable visage, that is, those<br>wrathful ones amongst them who were in Ghatotkacha's van. Beholding them<br>repulsed from the encounter by means of the shafts shot from the bow of<br>Drona's son, Bhimasena's son Ghatotkacha of gigantic size was filled with<br>rage. He then exhibited a fierce and awful illusion. Therewith that<br>prince of the Rakshasas, endued with extraordinary powers of illusion,<br>confounded the son of Drona in that battle. Then all thy troops, in<br>consequence of that illusion, turned their backs upon the field. They<br>beheld one another cut down and lying prostrate on the surface of the<br>earth, writhing convulsively, perfectly helpless, and bathed in blood.<br>Drona and Duryodhana and Salya and Aswatthaman, and other great bowmen<br>that were regarded as foremost among the Kauravas, also seemed to fly<br>away. All the car-warriors seemed to be crushed, and all the kings seemed<br>to be slain. And horses and horse-riders seemed to be cut down in<br>thousands. Beholding all this, thy troops fled away towards their tents.<br>And although, O king, both myself and Devavrata cried out at the top of<br>our voices, saying, 'Fight, do not fly away, all this is Rakshasa<br>illusion in battle, applied by Ghatotkacha.' Yet they stopped not, their<br>senses having been confounded. Although both of us said so, still struck<br>with panic, they gave no credit to our words. Beholding them fly away the<br>Pandavas regarded the victory to be theirs. With Ghatotkacha (among them)<br>they uttered many leonine shouts. And all around they filled the air with<br>their shouts mingled with the blare of their conches and the beat of<br>their drums. It was thus that thy whole army, routed by the wicked<br>Ghatotkacha, towards the hour of sunset, fled away in all directions.'"
