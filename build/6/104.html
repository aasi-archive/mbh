                            Sanjaya said, "At mid-day, O king, happened a fierce battle, fraught with<br>great carnage, between Bhishma and the Somakas. That foremost of<br>car-warriors, viz., Ganga's son began to consume the ranks of the<br>Pandavas with keen shafts by hundreds and thousands. Thy sire Devavrata<br>began to grind those troops like a herd of bulls grinding (with their<br>tread) a heap of paddy sheaves. Then Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin and<br>Virata and Drupada, falling upon Bhishma in that battle, struck that<br>mighty car-warrior with numerous arrows. Bhishma then, having pierced<br>Dhrishtadyumna and Virata each with three arrows, sped a long shaft, O<br>Bharata, at Drupada. Thus pierced in battle by Bhishma, that grinder of<br>foes, those great bowmen became filled with wrath O king, like snakes<br>trod upon (by human feet). Then Sikhandin pierced the grandsire of the<br>Bharatas (with many shafts). Of unfading glory, Bhishma, however,<br>regarding his foe as a female struck him not. Dhrishtadyumna then, in<br>that battle, blazing up with wrath like fire, struck the grandsire with<br>three shafts in his arms and chest. And Drupada pierced Bhishma with five<br>and twenty shafts, and Virata pierced him with ten, and Sikhandin with<br>five and twenty. Deeply pierced (with those shafts) he became covered<br>with blood, and looked beautiful like a red Asoka variegated with<br>flowers. Then the son of Ganga pierced, in return, each of them with<br>three straight shafts. And then, O sire, he cut off Drupada's bow with a<br>broad-headed arrow. The latter then, taking up another bow, pierced<br>Bhishma with five shafts. And he pierced Bhishma's charioteer also with<br>three sharp shafts on the field of battle. Then the five sons of<br>Draupadi, and the five Kaikeya brothers and Satyaki also of the Satwata<br>race, headed by Yudhishthira, all rushed towards Ganga's son, desirous of<br>protecting the Panchalas headed by Dhrishtadyumna. And so all the<br>warriors of thy army also, O king, prepared to protect Bhishma, rushed at<br>the head of their troops against the Pandava host. And then happened<br>there a fierce general engagement between thy army of men and steeds and<br>theirs, that increased the population of Yama's kingdom. And car-warriors<br>falling upon car-warriors despatched one another to Yama's abode. And so<br>men and elephant-riders and horse-riders, falling upon others (of their<br>class), despatched them to the other world with straight shafts And here<br>and there on the field, O monarch, cars, deprived of riders and<br>charioteers by means of diverse kinds of fierce shafts, were in that<br>battle dragged on all sides over the field. And those cars, O king,<br>crushing large numbers of men and steeds in battle, were seen to resemble<br>the wind itself (in speed) and vapoury edifices in the firmament (for<br>their picturesque forms). And many car-warriors cased in mail and endued<br>with great energy, decked with ear-rings and head-gears and adorned with<br>garlands and bracelets, resembling the children of the celestials, equal<br>to Sakra himself for prowess in battle, surpassing Vaisravana in wealth<br>and Vrishaspati in intelligence, ruling over extensive territories, and<br>possessed of great heroism, O monarch, deprived of their cars, were seen<br>to run hither and thither like ordinary men. Huge tuskers also, O chief<br>of men, deprived of their skilled riders, ran, crushing friendly ranks,<br>and fell down with loud shrieks. Prodigious elephants looking like<br>newly-risen clouds and roaring also like the clouds, were seen to run in<br>all directions, deprived of their coats of mail. And, O sire, their<br>Chamaras and variegated standards, their umbrellas with golden staves,<br>and the bright lances (of their riders), lay scattered about.[468] And<br>elephant-riders, O king, deprived of their elephants, belonging both of<br>thy army and theirs, were seen to run (on foot) amid that awful press.<br>And steeds from diverse countries, decked with ornaments of gold, were<br>seen, by hundreds and thousands, to run with the speed of the wind. And<br>horse-riders, deprived of their horses, and armed with swords were in<br>that battle seen to run, or made to run (by others assailing them).<br>Elephant, meeting with a flying elephant in that dreadful battle,<br>proceeded, quickly crushing foot-soldiers and steeds. And, similarly, O<br>king those prodigious creatures crushed many cars in that battle, and<br>cars also, coming upon fallen steeds crushed them (in their course). And<br>steeds too, in the press of battle, crushed many foot-soldiers, O king<br>(with their hoofs). And thus, O monarch, they crushed one another in<br>diverse ways.[469] And in that fierce and awful battle there flowed a<br>terrible river of bloody current. And heaps of bows obstructed its<br>straight course, and the hair (of slain warriors) formed its moss. And<br>(broken) cars formed its lakes, and arrows its eddies. And steeds formed<br>its fishes. And heads (severed from trunks) formed its blocks of stone.<br>And it abounded with elephants that formed its crocodiles. And coats of<br>mail and head-gears formed its froth. And bows (in the hands of the<br>warriors) constituted the speed of its current, and swords its tortoises.<br>And banners and standards in profusion formed the trees on its banks. And<br>mortals constituted its banks which that river continually ate away. And<br>it abounded with cannibals that formed its swans. And that stream<br>(instead of swelling the ocean with its discharge) swelled the population<br>of Yama's kingdom. And brave Kshatriyas,&#8212;mighty car-warriors,&#8212;casting<br>off all fear, O king, sought to cross that river with the aid of cars,<br>elephants, and steeds that played the part of rafts and boats. And as the<br>river Vaitarani beareth all departed spirits towards the domains of the<br>King of the Dead, so that river of bloody current bore away all timid men<br>deprived of their senses in a swoon. And the Kshatriyas, beholding that<br>awful carnage, all exclaimed, saying, 'Alas, through Duryodhana's fault<br>the Kshatriyas are being exterminated. Why, Oh, Dhritarashtra of sinful<br>soul, deluded by avarice, harboured envy for the sons of Pandu, who are<br>graced with numerous virtues.' Diverse exclamations of this kind were<br>heard there, made by one another, fraught with the praises of the<br>Pandavas and censure of thy sons. Hearing then these words uttered by all<br>the combatants, thy son Duryodhana, that offender against all, addressed<br>Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and Salya, O Bharata, saying, 'Fight ye<br>without boastfulness. Why tarry ye at all?' Then the battle was resumed<br>between the Kurus and the Pandavas, that fierce battle, O king, caused by<br>the match at dice and marked by an awful slaughter. Thou beholdest now, O<br>son of Vichitravirya, the dreadful fruit of that rejection by thee (of<br>the counsels of thy friends) though warned against it by many illustrious<br>persons. Neither the sons of Pandu, O king, nor their troops, nor they<br>that follow them, nor the Kauravas, show the least regard for their lives<br>in battle. For this reason, O tiger among men, a dreadful destruction of<br>kinsmen is taking place, caused either by Destiny or by thy evil policy,<br>O king."
