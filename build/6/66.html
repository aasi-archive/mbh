                            "Bhishma said, 'Then that illustrious Deity, the Lord of the worlds,<br>replied unto Brahma in a soft deep voice, saying,&#8212;'Through Yoga, O sire,<br>all that is wished by thee is known to me. It will be even as thou<br>wishest,&#8212;And saying this, he disappeared then and there. Then the gods,<br>Rishis, and Gandharvas, filled with great wonder and curiosity all asked<br>the Grandsire, saying,&#8212;'Who is that one, O Lord, that was worshipped by<br>thy illustrious self with such humility and praised in such high words?<br>We desire to hear,&#8212;Thus addressed, the illustrious Grandsire replied<br>unto all the Gods, the regenerate Rishis, and the Gandharvas, in sweet<br>words saying,&#8212;He who is called TAT, He who is Supreme, He who is<br>existent at present and who will be for all time, He who is the highest<br>Self, He who is the Soul of beings, and who is the great Lord, I was<br>talking even with His ever-cheerful self, ye bulls among gods. The Lord<br>of the Universe was solicited by me, for the good of the Universe, to<br>take his birth among mankind in the family of Vasudeva. I said unto<br>him,&#8212;For the slaughter of the Asuras take thy birth in the world of<br>men!&#8212;Those Daityas and Rakshasas, of fierce form and great strength,<br>that were slain in battle, have been born among men. Indeed, the<br>illustrious and mighty Lord, taking birth in the human womb, will live on<br>the Earth, accompanied by Nara. Those ancient and best of Rishis, viz.,<br>Nara and Narayana, are incapable of defeat in battle by even all the<br>celestials united together. Of immeasurable effulgence, those Rishis<br>viz., Nara and Narayana, when born together in the world of men, will not<br>be known (as such) by fools. He, from whose Self, I, Brahman, the Lord of<br>the whole Universe, have sprung that Vasudeva, that Supreme God of all<br>the worlds, is worthy of your adoration. Endued with great energy, and<br>bearing the conch, the discus, and the mace, he should never be<br>disregarded as a man, ye best of deities. He is the Supreme Mystery, the<br>Supreme refuge, the Supreme Brahma, and the Supreme glory. He is without<br>decay, Unmanifest, and Eternal. He it is who hath been sung as Purusha,<br>though none can comprehend him. The divine Artificer hath sung of him as<br>the Supreme Energy, the Supreme Felicity, and the Supreme Truth.<br>Therefore, the Lord Vasudeva of immeasurable prowess should never be<br>disregarded as a man by all the Asuras and the gods with Indra at their<br>head. That person of foolish understanding is called a wretch, who, from<br>disregard, speaketh of Hrishikesa as only a man. People speak of him as<br>one labouring under darkness who disregardeth Vasudeva, that Yogin of<br>illustrious soul, for his entering into a human form. People speak of him<br>as one labouring under darkness who knoweth not that Divine personage,<br>that Soul of the mobile and the immobile creation, that one bearing the<br>auspicious wheel (on his breast), that one of dazzling effulgence, that<br>one from whose navel hath sprung the (primeval) lotus. He who<br>disregardeth that wearer of the diadem and the Kaustuva gem, that<br>dispeller of fears of his friends, that high-souled one, sinketh in thick<br>darkness. Having known all these truths duly, that Lord of the worlds,<br>viz., Vasudeva, should be adored by every one, ye best of gods.'&#8212;<br><br>"Bhishma continued,&#8212;Having said these words unto those gods and Rishis<br>in days of yore, the illustrious Grandsire, dismissing them all, repaired<br>to his own abode. And the gods and the Gandharvas, and the Munis and the<br>Apsaras also, having listened to those words spoken by Brahman, were<br>filled with delight and repaired to heaven. Even this was heard by me, O<br>sire, from Rishis of cultured soul talking in their assembly, of<br>Vasudeva, that ancient one. And O thou that art well-versed in<br>scriptures, I heard this from Rama, the son of Jamadagni, and Markandeya<br>of great wisdom, and Vyasa and Narada also. Having learnt all this and<br>heard of the illustrious Vasudeva as the Eternal Lord, the Supreme God of<br>all the worlds, and the great Master, from whom hath sprung Brahman<br>himself, the Father of the Universe, why should not that Vasudeva be<br>adored and worshipped by men? Forbidden wert thou before, O sire, by<br>sages of cultured souls, (who said unto thee)&#8212;Never go to war with that<br>Vasudeva armed with bow as also with the Pandavas,&#8212;This, from folly,<br>thou couldst not apprehend. I regard thee therefore, as a wicked Rakshsa.<br>Thou art, besides, enveloped in darkness. It is for this that thou hatest<br>Govinda and Dhananjaya the son of Pandu, for who else among men would<br>hate the divine Nara and Narayana? It is for this, O king, that I say<br>unto thee that this one is Eternal and Unfading, pervading the whole<br>Universe, Unchanging, the Ruler, Creator and Upholder of all, and the<br>truly Existent. He it is who upholdeth the three worlds. He is the<br>Supreme Lord of all mobile and immobile creatures, and He is the great<br>Master, He is warrior, He is Victory, He is Victor, and He is the Lord of<br>all nature. O king, He is full of goodness and divested of all the<br>qualities of Darkness and Passion. There, where Krishna is, there<br>righteousness is; and there is victory where righteousness is. It is by<br>the Yoga of his Supreme Excellence, and the Yoga of his Self, that the<br>sons of Pandu, O king, are supported. Victory, therefore, will surely be<br>theirs. He it is that always imparteth to the Pandavas and understanding<br>endued with righteousness, and strength in battle; and He it is that<br>always protecteth them from danger. He is the Eternal God, pervading all<br>beings, and ever blessed. He, of whom thou hadst asked me, is known by<br>the name of Vasudeva. He it is whom Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas<br>and Sudras, having distinctive features of their own, humbly serve and<br>worship with restrained hearts and performing their own duties. He it is<br>who, towards the close of the Dwapara Yuga and the beginning of the Kali<br>Yuga, is sung of with Sankarshana, by believers with devotion. It is that<br>Vasudeva that createth, Yuga after Yuga, the worlds of the gods and the<br>mortals, all cities girt by the sea, and the region of human<br>habitation.&#8212;"
