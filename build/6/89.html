                            Sanjaya said, "The Pandavas were incapable of even looking at Bhishma<br>excited with rage in battle and scorching every side like the Sun himself<br>shedding scorching heat. Then all the (Pandava) troops, at the command of<br>Dharma's son, rushed at the son of Ganga who was grinding (everything)<br>with his whetted arrows, Bhishma, however, who delighted in battle felled<br>the mightiest of bowmen amongst the Srinjayas and the Panchalas, with his<br>shafts. Though thus slaughtered by Bhishma, the Panchalas along with the<br>Somakas still rushed impetuously at him, forsaking the fear of death. The<br>heroic Bhishma, the son of Santanu, however, in that battle, cut off, O<br>king, the arms and heads of their car-warriors. Thy sire, Devavrata<br>deprived their car-warriors of cars. And the heads of cavalry soldiers on<br>their chargers fell fast. And we beheld, O king, huge elephants looking<br>like hills, deprived of their riders, and paralysed with Bhishma's<br>weapons, lying all around. Amongst the Pandavas, O king, there was no<br>other man save that foremost of car-warriors, the mighty Bhimasena, (who<br>could resist Bhishma). Indeed, Bhima alone, approaching Bhishma,<br>encountered him in battle. Then in that encounter between Bhima and<br>Bhishma, a fierce and terrible uproar arose among all the troops (of the<br>Kauravas). The Pandavas then, filled with joy, uttered leonine shouts.<br>During that destructive carnage, king Duryodhana, surrounded by his<br>uterine brothers, protected Bhishma in that battle. Then that foremost of<br>car-warriors, viz., Bhima, slew Bhishma's charioteer. Thereupon the<br>steeds no longer controlled, ran away from the field with car. Then that<br>slayer of foes, viz., Bhima with a sharp arrow having a horse-shoe head,<br>cut off the head of Sunabha. (Thus) slain, the latter fell down on the<br>earth. When that son of thine, that mighty car-warrior and great bowman<br>was slain, seven of his heroic brothers, O sire, could not (quietly) bear<br>(that act). These, viz., Adityaketu and Vahvasin, and Kundadhara and<br>Mahodara, and Aparajita, and Panditaka and the invincible Visalaksha,<br>clad in variegated armour and with their beautiful coats of mail and<br>weapons,&#8212;these grinders of foes desirous of battle,&#8212;rushed against the<br>son of Pandu. And Mahodara, in that battle, pierced Bhimasena with nine<br>winged arrows, each resembling the thunder-bolt in force, like the slayer<br>of Vritra striking (the great Asura) Namuchi. And Adityaketu struck him<br>with seventy shafts, and Vishnu with five. And Kundadhara struck him with<br>ninety shafts, and Visalaksha with seven. And that conqueror of foes, the<br>mighty car-warrior Aparajita, O king, struck Bhimasena of great strength<br>with many arrows. And Panditaka also, in battle, pierced him with three<br>arrows. Bhima, however, did not (quietly) bear these attacks of his foes<br>in battle. Forcibly grasping the bow with his left hand, that grinder of<br>foes cut off, in that battle, the head, with a straight shaft, of thy son<br>Aparajita, graced with a fine nose. Thus vanquished by Bhima, his head<br>then dropped on the ground. Then, in the very sight of all the troops,<br>Bhima despatched, with another broad-headed arrow, the mighty car-warrior<br>Kundadhara to the domain of Death. Then that hero of immeasurable soul,<br>once more aiming an arrow, sped it, O Bharata, at Panditaka in that<br>battle. And the arrow killing Panditaka, entered the earth, like a snake<br>impelled by Death quickly entering the earth after despatching the person<br>(whose hour had come). Of undepressed soul, that hero then, O king,<br>recollecting his former woes, felled Visalaksha's head, cutting it off<br>with three arrows. Then Bhima, in that battle, struck the mighty bowman<br>Mahodara in the centre of the chest with a long shaft. Slain (therewith),<br>O king, the latter fell down on the earth. Then, O Bharata, cutting off<br>with an arrow the umbrella of Adityaketu in that battle, he severed his<br>head with another broad-headed shaft of exceeding sharpness. Then, O<br>monarch, excited with rage, Bhima, with another straight shaft,<br>despatched Vahvasin towards the abode of Yama. Then thy other sons, O<br>king, all fled away regarding the words to be true which Bhima had<br>uttered in the (midst of the Kaurava) assembly.[430] Then king Duryodhana<br>afflicted with sorrow on account of his brothers, addressed all his<br>troops, saying, 'There is Bhima. Let him be slain.' Thus, O king, thy<br>sons, those mighty bowmen, beholding their brothers slain, recollected<br>those words beneficial and peaceful, that Vidura of great wisdom had<br>spoken. Indeed, those words of the truthful Vidura are now being<br>realised,&#8212;those beneficial words, O king, which, influenced by<br>covetousness and folly as also by affection for thy sons, thou couldst<br>not then understand. From the way in which that mighty armed hero is<br>slaying the Kauravas, it seemeth that that mighty son of Pandu hath<br>assuredly taken his birth for the destruction of thy sons. Meanwhile,<br>king Duryodhana, O sire, overwhelmed with great grief, went to Bhishma,<br>and there, overcome with sorrow, he began to lament, saying, 'My heroic<br>brothers have been slain in battle by Bhimasena. Although, again, all our<br>troops are fighting bravely, yet they also are failing. Thou seemest to<br>disregard us, behaving (as thou dost) like an indifferent spectator,<br>Alas, what course have I taken. Behold my evil destiny.'"<br><br>Sanjaya continued. "Hearing these cruel words of Duryodhana, thy sire<br>Devavrata with eyes filled with tears, said this unto him.[431] 'Even<br>this was said by me before, as also by Drona, and Vidura, and the<br>renowned Gandhari. O son, thou didst not then comprehend it. O grinder of<br>foes, it hath also been before settled by me that neither myself, nor<br>Drona, will ever escape with life from this battle. I tell thee truly<br>that those upon whom Bhima will cast his eyes in battle, he will surely<br>slay. Therefore, O king, summoning all thy patience, and firmly resolved<br>on battle, fight with the sons of Pritha, making heaven thy goal. As<br>regards the Pandavas, they are incapable of being vanquished by the very<br>gods with Vasava (at their head). Therefore, setting thy heart firmly on<br>battle, fight, O Bharata.&#8212;'"
