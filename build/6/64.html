                            Sanjaya said, "Then, O king, Bhurisravas, excited with great wrath,<br>pierced Satyaki with nine arrows like the conductor of an elephant<br>piercing an elephant with the iron hook. Satyaki also, of immeasurable<br>soul, in the very sight of all the troops, pierced the Kaurava warrior<br>with nine shafts. Then king Duryodhana, accompanied by his uterine<br>brothers, surrounded Somadatta's son thus striving in battle. Similarly<br>the Pandavas also, of great energy, quickly surrounding Satyaki in that<br>battle took up their positions around him. And Bhimasena, excited with<br>wrath, and with mace upraised, O Bharata, encountered all thy sons headed<br>by Duryodhana. With many thousands of cars, and excited with wrath and<br>vindictiveness, thy son Nandaka pierced Bhimasena of great might with<br>keen-edged and sharp-pointed shafts whetted on stone and winged with the<br>feathers of the kanka bird. Then Duryodhana, O king, in that great<br>battle, excited with wrath, struck Bhimasena in the breast with nine<br>shafts. Then the mighty-armed Bhima of great strength mounted on his own<br>excellent car and addressing (his charioteer) Visoka, said, 'These heroic<br>and mighty sons of Dhritarashtra, all great car-warriors, are exceedingly<br>angry with me and desirous of slaying me in battle. I will slay all these<br>today in thy sight, without doubt. Therefore, O charioteer, guide my<br>steed in battle with care.' Having said this, O monarch, Pritha's son<br>pierced thy son with sharp-pointed arrows decked with gold. And he<br>pierced Nandaka in return with three arrows between his two breasts. Then<br>Duryodhana having pierced the mighty Bhima with six arrows pierced Visoka<br>in return with three other sharp arrows. And Duryodhana, O king, as if<br>smiling the while, with three other sharp arrows cut off at the grasp the<br>resplendent bow of Bhima in that battle. Bhima then, that bull among men,<br>beholding his charioteer Visoka afflicted, in that conflict, with sharp<br>shafts by thy son armed with the bow, and unable to bear it, drew another<br>excellent bow, excited with wrath, for the destruction of thy son, O<br>monarch. And excited with great wrath, he also took up an arrow with<br>horse-shoe head and furnished with excellent wings. And with that (arrow)<br>Bhima cut off the excellent bow of the king. Then thy son, excited to the<br>highest pitch of fury, leaving that broken bow aside, speedily took up<br>another that was tougher. And aiming a terrible shaft blazing as Death's<br>rod, the Kuru king, excited with rage struck Bhimasena between his two<br>breasts. Deeply pierced therewith, and greatly pained, he sat down on the<br>terrace of his car. And while seated on the terrace of his car, he<br>swooned away. Beholding Bhima thus unmanned, the illustrious and mighty<br>car-warriors of the Pandava army, headed by Abhimanyu could not bear it.<br>And those warriors then, with great steadiness, showered on thy sons'<br>head a thick down-pour of fierce shafts. Then the mighty Bhimasena,<br>regaining consciousness, pierced Duryodhana at first with those shafts<br>and then with five. And that mighty bowman the son of Pandu then pierced<br>Salya with five and twenty shafts furnished with golden wings. And<br>pierced therewith, Salya was borne away from the battle. Then thy<br>fourteen sons, viz., Senapati, Sushena, Jalasandha, Sulochana, Ugra,<br>Bhimaratha, Bhima, Viravahu, Aolupa, Durmukha, Dushpradarsha, Vivitsu,<br>Vikata, and Sama, then encountered Bhimasena in battle. United together<br>they rushed against Bhimasena, and with eyes red in wrath, showering<br>countless arrows, they pierced him deeply. Then the heroic and mighty<br>Bhimasena of strong arms, beholding thy sons, licking the corners of his<br>mouth like a wolf in the midst of smaller creatures, fell upon them with<br>the impetuosity of Garuda. And the son of Pandu then cut off the head of<br>Senapati with a shaft having a horse-shoe head. And with delighted soul<br>and laughing the while, that mighty-armed warrior, piercing Jalasandha<br>with three arrows, despatched him to Yama's abode. And next, smiting<br>Sushena, he sent him to the presence of Death's self. And with a single<br>broad-headed shaft he felled on the ground the head, handsome as the<br>moon, of Ugra, decked with turban and adorned with ear-rings. And in that<br>battle, Pandu's son Bhima, with seventy shafts, despatched Viravahu to<br>the other world with his steeds and standard and charioteer. And smiling<br>the while, O king, Bhimasena quickly despatched both the brothers Bhima<br>and Bhimaratha also to Yama's abode. And then in that great battle in the<br>very sight of all the troops, with an arrow of horse-shoe head Bhima<br>despatched Sulochana also to Death's domain. Then the rest of thy sons<br>that were there, O king, beholding the prowess of Bhimasena and while<br>thus being struck by that illustrious warrior, all fled from battle from<br>fear of Bhima. Then Santanu's son, addressing all the mighty car-warriors<br>(of his army) said, 'That fierce bowman, Bhima, excited with wrath in<br>battle, is slaying the mighty sons of Dhritarashtra and other heroic<br>car-warriors united together, whatever their knowledge of weapons, and<br>whatever their bravery. Therefore, seize ye all that son of Pandu'. Thus<br>addressed, all the troops of the Dhritarashtra army, excited with rage,<br>rushed towards Bhimasena endued with great might, And Bhagadatta, O king,<br>on his elephant of rent temples, suddenly rushed thither where Bhimasena<br>was stationed. And thither to the combat, he shrouded Bhima with his<br>shafts whetted on stone so as to make him completely invisible, like the<br>clouds covering the sun. Those mighty car-warriors, however, (of the<br>Pandava army), relying on the prowess of their own arms, could not bear<br>that shrouding of Bhima (with the arrowy showers of Bhagadatta). They,<br>therefore, surrounding Bhagadatta on all sides, poured on him their<br>arrowy down-pours. And they pierced his elephant also with showers of<br>shafts. And struck by all those mighty car-warriors with showers of<br>fierce shafts of diverse kinds that elephant, O king, of the ruler of the<br>Pragjyotishas with blood trickling down his body, became beautiful to<br>behold on the field of battle like a mass of clouds tinged with the rays<br>of the sun. And that elephant with temporal juice trickling down urged by<br>Bhagadatta, like the Destroyer, ran with double his former speed, shaking<br>the very earth with his tread. Then all those mighty car-warriors,<br>beholding that terrible mien of the animal, and regarding it<br>irresistible, became cheerless. Then king Bhagadatta, that tiger among<br>men, excited with rage, struck Bhimasena between his two breasts with a<br>straight shaft. Deeply pierced by the king with that shaft, that great<br>bowman and mighty car-warrior, with limbs deprived of sensation in<br>consequence of a swoon, sat down on his car, holding his flagstaff. And<br>beholding those mighty car-warriors terrified and Bhimasena in a swoon,<br>Bhagadatta of great prowess uttered a loud roar. Then, O king, that<br>terrible Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, beholding Bhima in that state, became<br>excited with rage and there and then disappeared from the view. And<br>creating a terrible illusion enhancing the fears of the timid, he<br>reappeared in a moment assuming a fierce form. Himself riding on an<br>Airavata created by his powers of illusion, the other Dik-elephants,<br>viz., Anjana, Vamana, and Mahapadma of blazing glory, followed him. And<br>those three mighty elephants, ridden by Rakshasas, were of huge form,<br>with juice profusely trickling down in three lines, and endued with great<br>speed and prowess. Then Ghatotkacha urged his own elephant to battle,<br>desirous, O chastiser of foes, of slaying Bhagadatta with his elephant.<br>And those other elephants, excited with fury and each endued with four<br>tusks, urged by Rakshasas of great strength, fell from all sides upon<br>Bhagadatta's elephant and afflicted him with their tusks. And the<br>elephant of Bhagadatta, thus afflicted by those elephants, (already)<br>struck with arrows and feeling great pain, uttered loud cries that<br>resembled the thunder of Indra. And hearing those terrible and loud cries<br>of that roaring elephant, Bhishma, addressing Drona, Suyodhana and all<br>the kings, said, 'The mighty bowman Bhagadatta is battling with the<br>wicked-souled son of Hidimva, and hath fallen into great distress. That<br>Rakshasa is of huge form, and the king also is very wrathful. Engaged in<br>battle, they would certainly prove each other's death. Loud shouts were<br>also heard of the rejoicing Pandavas, and the cries of agony of (king<br>Bhagadatta's) terrified elephant. Blessed be ye, let us all go there for<br>rescuing the king, for, if left unprotected, in battle, he will soon give<br>up his life. Ye warriors of great energy, do, as I bid, even now. Ye<br>sinless ones, make no delay. The combat deepens and becometh fierce,<br>making the hair to stand on end. That commander of a division is<br>high-born, endued with great bravery, and devoted to us. Ye warriors of<br>unfading glory, it is meet that his rescue should be effected by us.'<br>Hearing these words of Bhishma, all the kings (of the Kuru army), headed<br>by Bharadwaja's son, desirous of rescuing Bhagadatta, proceeded with<br>great speed to where the ruler of the Pragjyotishas was. And beholding<br>the enemy advancing, the Panchalas with the Pandavas, headed by<br>Yudhishthira, pursued them behind. Then that prince of Rakshasas, endued<br>with great prowess, beholding that division (of the enemy) advance,<br>uttered a fierce roar, deep as that of thunder. Hearing that roar of his<br>and beholding those battling elephants, Santanu's son Bhishma once again<br>addressed Bharadwaja's son and said, 'I do not like to fight (to-day)<br>with the wicked-souled son of Hidimva. Endued with great might and<br>energy, he is at present well-supported. He is incapable of being<br>vanquished now by the wielder of the thunder-bolt himself. Of sureness of<br>aim, he is a great smiter. As regards ourselves, our animals are tired<br>(today). We have also been greatly mangled by Panchalas and the Pandavas.<br>I do not like fresh encounter with the victorious Pandavas. Let the<br>withdrawal of our army, therefore, be proclaimed today. Tomorrow we will<br>fight with the foe.' Hearing these words of the grandsire, the Kauravas,<br>afflicted with the fear of Ghatotkacha, and availing of the advent of<br>night as a pretext, gladly did what the grandsire said. And after the<br>Kauravas had withdrawn, the Pandavas, crowned with victory uttered<br>leonine roars, mingling them with the blare of conches and the notes of<br>pipes. Thus did the battle take place that day, O Bharata, between the<br>Kurus and the Pandavas headed by Ghatotkacha. And the Kauravas also,<br>vanquished by the Pandavas and overcome with shame, retired to their own<br>tents when night came. And those mighty car-warriors, the sons of Pandu,<br>their bodies mangled with shafts and themselves filled with (the result<br>of) the battle, proceeded, O king, towards their encampment, with<br>Bhimasena and Ghatotkacha, O monarch, at their head. And filled with<br>great joy, O king, they worshipped those heroes. And they uttered diverse<br>kinds of shouts which were mingled with the notes of trumpets. And those<br>high-souled warriors shouted making the very earth tremble therewith, and<br>grinding as it were, O sire, the hearts of thy sons. And it was thus that<br>those chastisers of foes, when night came, proceeded towards their tents.<br>And king Duryodhana, cheerless at the death of his brothers, passed some<br>time in thoughtfulness, overcome with grief and tears. Then making all<br>the arrangements for his camp according to the rules (of military<br>science), he began to pass the hours in meditation, scorched with grief<br>and afflicted with sorrow on account of his (slain) brothers."
