                            Sanjaya said,&#8212;"Then, O bull of Bharata's race, king Yudhishthira,<br>disposing his own troops in counter array against the divisions of<br>Bhishma, urged them on, saying,&#8212;'The Pandavas have now disposed their<br>forces in counter array agreeably to what is laid down (in the<br>scriptures). Ye sinless ones, fight fairly, desirous of (entering) the<br>highest heaven'.&#8212;In the centre (of the Pandava army) was Sikhandin and<br>his troops, protected by Arjuna. And Dhristadyumna moved in the van,<br>protected by Bhima. The southern division (of the Pandava army) was<br>protected. O king, by that mighty bowman, the handsome Yuyudhana, that<br>foremost combatant of the Satwata race, resembling Indra himself.<br>Yudhisthira was stationed on a car that was worthy of bearing Mahendra<br>himself, adorned with an excellent standard, variegated with gold and<br>gems, and furnished with golden traces (for the steeds), in the midst of<br>his elephant divisions.[114] His pure white umbrella with ivory handle,<br>raised over his head, looked exceedingly beautiful; and many great Rishis<br>walked around the king[115] uttering words in his praise. And many<br>priests, and regenerate Rishis and Siddhas, uttering hymns in his<br>praise[116] wished him, as they walked around, the destructions of his<br>enemies, by the aid of Japas, and Mantras, efficacious drugs, and diverse<br>propitiatory ceremonies. That high-souled chief of the Kurus, then giving<br>away unto the Brahmanas kine and fruits and flowers and golden coins<br>along with cloths[117] proceeded like Sakra, the chief of the celestials.<br>The car of Arjuna, furnished with a hundred bells, decked with Jamvunada<br>gold of the best kind, endued with excellent wheels, possessed of the<br>effulgence of fire, and unto which were yoked white steeds, looked<br>exceedingly brilliant like a thousand suns.[118] And on that ape-bannered<br>car the reins of which were held by Kesava, stood Arjuna with Gandiva and<br>arrows in hand&#8212;a bowman whose peer exists not on earth, nor ever<br>will.[119] For crushing thy sons' troops he who assumeth the most awful<br>form,&#8212;who, divested of weapons, with only his bare hands, poundeth to<br>dust men, horses, and elephants,&#8212;that strong-armed Bhimasena, otherwise<br>called Vrikodara, accompanied by the twins, became the protector of the<br>heroic car-warriors (of the Pandava) army. Like unto a furious prince of<br>lions of sportive gait, or like the great Indra himself with (earthly)<br>body on the Earth, beholding that invincible Vrikodara, like unto a proud<br>leader of an elephantine herd, stationed in the van (of the army), the<br>warriors on thy side, their strength weakened by fear, began to tremble<br>like elephants sunk in mire.<br><br>"Unto that invincible prince Gudakesa staying in the midst of his troops,<br>Janardana, O chief of Bharata's race, said&#8212;He, who scorching us with his<br>wrath, stayeth in the midst of his forces, he, who will attack our troops<br>like a lion, he, who performed three hundred horse-sacrifices,&#8212;that<br>banner of Kuru's race, that Bhishma,&#8212;stayeth yonder! Yon ranks around<br>him on all sides great warriors like the clouds shrouding the bright<br>luminary. O foremost of men, slaying yon troops, seek battle with yonder<br>bull of Bharata's race."
