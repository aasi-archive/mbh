                            Sanjaya said, "After that great battle, king Duryodhana, approaching<br>Ganga's son and saluting him with humility, began to narrate to him all<br>that had happened about the victory won by Ghatotkacha and his own<br>defeat. That invincible warrior, O king, sighing repeatedly, said these<br>words unto Bhishma, the grandsire of the Kurus, 'O lord, relying upon<br>thee, as Vasudeva hath been (relied upon) by the foe, a fierce war hath<br>been commenced by me with the Pandavas. These eleven Akshauhinis of<br>celebrated troops that I have, are, with myself, obedient to thy command,<br>O chastiser of foes. O tiger among the Bharatas, though thus situated,<br>yet have I been defeated into battle by the Pandava warriors headed by<br>Bhimasena relying upon Ghatotkacha. It is this that consumeth my limbs<br>like fire consuming dry tree. O blessed one, O chastiser of foes, I<br>therefore, desire, through thy grace, O grandsire, to slay Ghatotkacha<br>myself, that worst of Rakshasas, relying upon thy invincible self. It<br>behoveth thee to see that wish of mine may be fulfilled.' Hearing these<br>words of the king, that foremost one among the Bharatas, viz., Bhishma,<br>the son of Santanu, said these words unto Duryodhana, 'Listen, O king, to<br>these words of mine that I say unto thee, O thou of Kuru's race, about<br>the way in which thou, O chastiser of foes, shouldst always behave. One's<br>own self, under all circumstances, should be protected in battle, O<br>repressor of foes. Thou shouldst always, O sinless one, battle with king<br>Yudhishthira&#8212;the Just, or with Arjuna, or with the twins, or with<br>Bhimasena. Keeping the duty of a king before himself, a king striketh a<br>king. Myself, and Drona, and Kripa, and Drona's son, and Kritavarman of<br>the Satwata race, and Salya, and Somadatta's son, and that mighty<br>car-warrior Vikarna, and thy heroic brothers headed by Dussasana, will<br>all, for thy sake, battle against that mighty Rakshasas. Or if thy grief<br>on account of that fierce prince of the Rakshasas be too great, let this<br>one proceed in battle against that wicked warrior, that is to say, king<br>Bhagadatta who is equal unto Purandara himself in fight'. Having said<br>this much unto the king, the grandsire skilled in speech then addressed<br>Bhagadatta in the presence of the (Kuru) king, saying, 'Proceed quickly,<br>O great monarch, against that invincible warrior, viz., the son of<br>Hidimva. Resist in battle, with care, and in view of all the bowmen, that<br>Rakshasa of cruel deeds, like Indra in days of old resisting Taraka. Thy<br>weapons are celestial. Thy prowess also is great, O chastiser of foes. In<br>days of old many have been the encounters that thou hadst with Asura, O<br>tiger among kings, thou art that Rakshasa's match in great battle.<br>Strongly supported by thy own troops, slay, O king, that bull among<br>Rakshasas'. Hearing these words of Bhishma the generalissimo (of the<br>Kaurava army), Bhagadatta specially set out with a leonine roar facing<br>the ranks of the foe. Beholding him advance towards them like a mass of<br>roaring clouds, many mighty car-warriors of the Pandava army proceeded<br>against him, inflamed with wrath. They were Bhimasena, and Abhimanyu and<br>the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha; and the sons of Draupadi, and Satyadhriti, and<br>Kshatradeva, O sire, and the rulers of the Chedis, and Vasudana, and the<br>king of the Dasarnas. Bhagadatta then, on his elephant named Supratika,<br>rushed against them. Then commenced a fierce and awful battle between the<br>Pandavas and Bhagadatta, that increased the population of Yama's kingdom.<br>Shafts of terrible energy and great impetuosity, shot by car-warriors,<br>fell, O king, on elephants and cars. Huge elephants with rent temples and<br>trained (to the fight) by their guides, approaching fell upon one another<br>fearlessly. Blind (with fury) in consequence of the temporal juice<br>trickling down their bodies, and excited with rage, attacking one another<br>with their tusks resembling stout bludgeons, they pierced one another<br>with the points of those weapons.[453] Graced with excellent tails, and<br>ridden by warriors armed with lances, steeds, urged by those riders fell<br>fearlessly and with great impetuosity upon one another. And<br>foot-soldiers, attacked by bodies of foot-soldiers with darts and lances,<br>fell down on the earth by hundreds and thousands. And car-warriors upon<br>their cars, slaughtering heroic adversaries in that battle by means of<br>barbed arrows and muskets and shafts, uttered leonine shouts.[454] And<br>during the progress of the battle making the hair stand on end, that<br>great bowman, viz., Bhagadatta, rushed towards Bhimasena, on his elephant<br>of rent temples and with juice trickling down in seven currents and<br>resembling (on that account) a mountain with (as many) rillets flowing<br>down its breast after a shower. And he came, O sinless one, scattering<br>thousands of arrows from the head of Supratika (whereon he stood) like<br>the illustrious Purandara himself on his Airavata. King Bhagadatta<br>afflicted Bhimasena with that arrowy shower like the clouds afflicting<br>the mountain breast with torrents of rain on the expiry of summer. That<br>mighty bowman Bhimasena, however, excited with rage, slew by his arrowy<br>showers the combatants numbering more than a hundred, that protected the<br>flanks and rear of Bhagadatta.[455] Beholding them slain, the valiant<br>Bhagadatta, filled with rage, urged his prince of elephants towards<br>Bhimasena's car. That elephant, thus urged by him, rushed impetuously<br>like an arrow propelled from the bowstring towards Bhimasena, that<br>chastiser of foes. Beholding that elephant advancing, the mighty<br>car-warriors of the Pandava army, placing Bhimasena at their head,<br>themselves rushed towards it. Those warriors were the (five) Kekaya<br>princes, and Abhimanyu, and the (five) sons of Draupadi and the heroic<br>ruler of the Dasarnas, and Kshatradeva also, O sire, and the ruler of the<br>Chedis, and Chitraketu. And all these mighty warriors came, inflamed with<br>anger, and exhibiting their excellent celestial weapons. And they all<br>surrounded in anger that single elephant (on which their adversary rode).<br>Pierced with many shafts, that huge elephant, covered with gore flowing<br>from his wounds, looked resplendent like a prince of mountain variegated<br>with (liquified) red chalk (after a shower). The ruler of the Dasarnas<br>then, on an elephant that resembled a mountain, rushed towards<br>Bhagadatta's elephant. That prince of elephants, however, viz.,<br>Supratika, bore (the rush of) that advancing compeer like the continent<br>bearing (the rush of) the surging sea. Beholding that elephant of the<br>high souled king of the Dasarnas thus resisted, even the Pandava troops,<br>applauding, cried out 'Excellent, excellent!' Then that best of kings,<br>viz., the ruler of the Pragjyotishas, excited with rage, sped four and<br>ten lances at that elephant. These, speedily penetrating through the<br>excellent armour, decked with gold, that covered the animal's body,<br>entered into it, like snakes entering anthills. Deeply pierced and<br>exceedingly pained, that elephant, O chief of the Bharatas, its fury<br>quelled, speedily turned back with great force. And it fled away with<br>great swiftness, uttering frightful shrieks, and crushing the Pandava<br>ranks like the tempest crushing trees with its violence. After that<br>elephant was (thus) vanquished, the mighty car-warriors of the Pandava<br>army, uttering loud leonine shouts, approached for battle. Placing Bhima<br>at their head, they rushed at Bhagadatta scattering diverse kinds of<br>arrows and diverse kinds of weapons. Hearing the fierce shouts, O king,<br>of those advancing warriors swelling with rage and vengeance, that great<br>bowman Bhagadatta, filled with rage and perfectly fearless, urged his own<br>elephant. That prince of elephants then, thus urged with the hook and the<br>toe, soon assumed the form of the (all-destructive) Samvarta fire (that<br>appears at the end of the Yuga). Crushing crowds of cars and (hostile)<br>compeers and steeds with riders, in that battle, it began, O king, to<br>turn hither and thither. Filled with rage it also crushed foot-soldiers<br>by hundreds and thousands. Attacked and agitated by that elephant, that<br>large force of the Pandavas shrank in dimensions, O king, like a piece of<br>leather exposed to the heat of fire. Beholding, then the Pandava array<br>broken by the intelligent Bhagadatta, Ghatotkacha, of fierce mien, O<br>king, with blazing face and eyes red as fire, filled with rage, rushed<br>towards him. Assuming a terrible form and burning with wrath, he took up<br>a bright dart capable of riving the very hills. Endued with great<br>strength, he forcibly hurled that dart that emitted blazing flames from<br>every part desirous of slaying that elephant. Beholding it coursing<br>towards him with great impetuosity, the ruler of the Pragjyotishas sped<br>at it a beautiful but fierce and sharp arrow with a crescent head.<br>Possessed of great energy he cut off that dart with that arrow of his.<br>Thereupon that dart, decked with gold, thus divided in twain, dropped<br>down on the ground, like the bolt of heaven, hurled by Indra, flashing<br>through the welkin. Beholding that dart (of his adversary), O king,<br>divided in twain and fallen on the ground, Bhagadatta took up a large<br>javelin furnished with a golden staff and resembling a flame of fire in<br>effulgence, and hurled it at the Rakshasa, saying, 'Wait, Wait'. Seeing<br>it coursing towards him like the bolt of heaven through the welkin, the<br>Rakshasa jumped up and speedily seizing it uttered a loud shout. And<br>quickly placing it against his knee, O Bharata, he broke it in the very<br>sight of all the kings. All this seemed exceedingly wonderful. Beholding<br>that feat achieved by the mighty Rakshasa, the celestials in the<br>firmament, with the Gandharvas  and the Munis, were filled with wonder.<br>And the Pandava warriors also, headed by Bhimasena, filled the earth with<br>cries of 'Excellent, Excellent'. Hearing, however, those loud shouts of<br>the rejoicing Pandavas, that great bowman, viz., the valiant Bhagadatta,<br>could not bear it (coolly). Drawing his large bow whose effulgence<br>resembled that of Indra's bolt, he roared with great energy at the mighty<br>car-warriors of the Pandava army, shooting at the same time many bright<br>arrows of great sharpness and possessed of the effulgence of fire. And he<br>pierced Bhima with one arrow, and the Rakshasa with nine. And he pierced<br>Abhimanyu with three, and the Kekaya brothers with five. And with another<br>straight arrow shot from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch, he<br>pierced, in that battle, the right arm of Kshatradeva. Thereupon the<br>latter's bow with arrow fixed on the bowstring dropped down from his<br>hand. And he struck the five sons of Draupadi with five arrows. And from<br>wrath, he slew the steeds of Bhimasena. And with three shafts winged with<br>feathers, he cut down Bhimasena's standard bearing the device of a lion.<br>And with three other shafts he pierced Bhima's charioteer. Deeply pierced<br>by Bhagadatta in that battle, and exceedingly pained, Visoka thereupon, O<br>chief of the Bharatas, sat down on the terrace of the car. Then, O king,<br>that foremost of car-warriors, viz., Bhima, thus deprived of his car,<br>quickly jumped down from his large vehicle taking up his mace. Beholding<br>him with mace upraised and looking like a crested hill, all thy troops, O<br>Bharata, became filled with great fear. Just at this time that son of<br>Pandu who had Krishna for his charioteer, O king, slaughtering the foe on<br>all sides as he came, appeared at that spot where those tigers among men,<br>those mighty car-warriors, viz., Bhimasena and Ghatotkacha, sire and son,<br>were engaged with the ruler of the Pragjyotishas. Beholding his brothers,<br>those mighty car-warriors, engaged in battle, that son of Pandu quickly<br>commenced to fight, profusely scattering his shafts, O chief of the<br>Bharatas. Then that mighty car-warrior, viz., king Duryodhana, speedily<br>urged on a division of his troops abounding with cars and elephants.<br>Towards that mighty division of the Kauravas thus advancing with<br>impetuosity, Arjuna of white steeds rushed with great impetuosity.<br>Bhagadatta also, upon that elephant of his, O Bharata, crushing the<br>Pandava ranks, rushed towards Yudhishthira. Then commenced a fierce<br>battle between Bhagadatta, O sire, and the Panchalas, the Srinjayas, and<br>the Kekayas, with upraised weapons. Then Bhimasena, in that battle told<br>both Kesava and Arjuna in detail about the slaughter of Iravat as it had<br>occurred."
