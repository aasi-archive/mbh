                            Sanjaya said, "During the progress, O king, of that fierce battle fraught<br>with the slaughter of great heroes, Sakuni the glorious son of Suvala,<br>rushed against the Pandavas. And so also, O monarch, Hridika's son of the<br>Satwata race, that slayer of hostile heroes, rushed in that battle<br>against the Pandava ranks. And smiling the while, (several warriors on<br>thy side), with a large number of steeds consisting of the best of the<br>Kamvoja breed as also of those born in the country of the Rivers, and of<br>those belonging to Aratta and Mahi and Sindhu, and of those of Vanayu<br>also that were white in hue, and lastly those of hilly countries,<br>surrounded (the Pandava army).[438] And so also with horses, exceedingly<br>swift, fleet as the very winds, and belonging to the Tittri breed,<br>(others encompassed that army). And with many horses, clad in mail and<br>decked with gold, the foremost of their class and fleet as the winds the<br>mighty son of Arjuna (viz., Iravat), that slayer of foes, approached the<br>(Kaurava) force. This handsome and valiant son of Arjuna, named Iravat,<br>was begotten upon the daughter of the king of the Nagas by the<br>intelligent Partha. Her husband having been slain by Garuda, she became<br>helpless, and of cheerless soul. Childless as she was, she was bestowed<br>(upon Arjuna) by the high-souled Airavat. Partha accepted her for wife,<br>coming to him as she did under the influence of desire. It was thus that<br>that son of Arjuna was begotten upon the wife of another.[439] Abandoned<br>by his wicked uncle from hatred of Partha, he grew up in the region of<br>the Nagas, protected by his mother. And he was handsome and endued with<br>great strength, possessed of diverse accomplishments, and of prowess<br>incapable of being baffled. Hearing that Arjuna had gone to the region of<br>Indra, he speedily went thither. And the mighty-armed Iravat, possessed<br>of prowess incapable of being baffled, approaching his sire, saluted him<br>duly, standing before him with joined hands. And he introduced himself to<br>the high-souled Arjuna, saying, 'I am Iravat. blessed be thou, and I am<br>thy son, O lord'. And he reminded Arjuna of all the circumstances<br>connected with the latter's meeting with his mother. And thereupon the<br>son of Pandu recollected all those circumstances exactly as they<br>happened. Embracing his son then who resembled himself in<br>accomplishments, Partha, in Indra's abode, was filled with joy. The<br>mighty-armed Iravat then, O king, in the celestial regions was, O<br>Bharata, joyfully commanded by Arjuna, with regard to his own business,<br>(in these words), 'When the battle takes place, assistance should be<br>rendered by thee'. Saying 'Yes', O lord, he went away. And now at the<br>time of battle he presented himself. O king, accompanied with a large<br>number of steeds of great fleetness and beautiful colour. And those<br>steeds, decked with ornaments of gold, of various colours and exceeding<br>fleetness, suddenly coursed over the field, O king, like swans on the<br>bosom of the vast deep. And those steeds failing upon thine of exceeding<br>swiftness, struck their chests and noses against those of thine.<br>Afflicted by their own impetuous clash (against thine), they suddenly<br>fell down, O king, on the earth. And in consequence of those steeds as<br>also of thine occasioned by that clash, loud sounds were heard resembling<br>what occurs at Garuda's swoop. And the rider of those steeds, O king,<br>thus dashing against one another in that battle, began to slay one<br>another fiercely. And during that general engagement which was fierce and<br>terrible, the chargers of both sides (escaping from press of battle) ran<br>wildly away over the field. Weakened by one another's shafts, brave<br>warriors, with their horses killed under them, and themselves worn out<br>with exertion, perished fast sabring one another. Then when those cavalry<br>divisions were thinned and a remnant only survived, the Younger brothers<br>of Suvala's son, Possessed of great wisdom, rode out, O Bharata (from the<br>Kaurava array) to the van of battle, mounted On excellent charges that<br>resembled the tempest itself in both fleetness and the violence of their<br>dash and that were well-trained and neither old nor young.[440] Those six<br>brothers endued with great strength, viz., Gaya, Gavaksha, Vrishava,<br>Charmavat, Arjava, and Suka dashed out of the mighty (Kaurava) array,<br>supported by Sakuni and by their respective forces of great valour,<br>themselves clad in mail, skilled in battle, fierce in mien, and possessed<br>of exceeding might. Breaking through that invincible cavalry division (of<br>the Pandavas), O thou of mighty arms, those Gandhara warriors who could<br>with difficulty be vanquished, supported by a large force, desirous of<br>heaven, longing for victory, and filled with delight, penetrated into it.<br>Beholding them filled with joy, the valiant Iravat, addressing his own<br>warriors decked with diverse ornaments and weapons, said unto them,<br>'Adopt such contrivances in consequence of which these Dhritarashtra<br>warriors with their weapons and animals may all be destroyed.' Saying<br>'Yes', all those warriors of Iravat began to slay those mighty and<br>invincible Dhartarashtra soldiers. Beholding that their own warriors were<br>thus overthrown by Iravat's division, those sons of Suvala being unable<br>to beat it coolly, all rushed at Iravat and surrounded him on all sides.<br>And commanding (all their followers) to attack those of Iravat with<br>lances, those heroes swept over the field, creating a great confusion.<br>And Iravat, pierced with lances by those high-souled warriors, and bathed<br>in blood that trickled down (his wounds), looked like an elephant pierced<br>with the hook. Wounded deeply on the chest, back, and flanks, singly<br>encountering the many, he did not yet, O king, swerve from his (natural)<br>firmness. Indeed, Iravat, excited with rage, deprived all those<br>adversaries of their senses, piercing them, in that battle, with sharp<br>shafts. And that chastiser of foes, tearing those lances from off his<br>body, struck with them the sons of Suvala in battle. Then unsheathing his<br>polished sword and taking a shield, he rushed on foot, desirous of<br>slaying Suvala's sons in that combat. The sons of Suvala, however,<br>recovering their senses, once more rushed at Iravat, excited with wrath.<br>Iravat, however, proud of his might, and displaying his lightness of<br>hand, proceeded towards all of them, armed with his sword. Moving as he<br>did with great activity, the sons of Suvala, although they moved about on<br>their fleet steeds, could not find an opportunity for striking that hero<br>(on foot). Beholding him then on foot, his foes surrounded him closely<br>and wished to take him captive. Then that crusher of foes, seeing them<br>contiguous to himself, struck off, with his sword, both their right and<br>left arms, and mangled their other limbs. Then those arms of theirs<br>adorned with gold, and their weapons, fell down on the earth, and they<br>themselves, with limbs mangled, fell down on the field, deprived of life.<br>Only Vrishava, O king, with many wounds on his person, escaped (with<br>life) from that dreadful battle destructive of heroes. Beholding them<br>lying on the field of battle, thy son Duryodhana, excited with wrath said<br>unto that Rakshasa of terrible mien, viz., Rishyasringa's son<br>(Alamvusha), that great bowman versed in illusion, that chastiser of<br>foes, who bore feelings of animosity against Bhimasena in consequence of<br>the slaughter of Vaka, these words: "Behold, O hero, how the mighty son<br>of Phalguni, versed in illusion, hath done me a severe injury by<br>destroying my forces. Thou also, O sire, art capable of going everywhere<br>at will and accomplished in all weapons of illusion. Thou cherishest<br>animosity also for Partha. Therefore, do thou slay this one in battle.'<br>Saying 'Yes', that Rakshasa of terrible mien proceeded with a leonine<br>roar to that spot where the mighty and youthful son of Arjuna was. And he<br>was supported by the heroic warriors of his own division, accomplished in<br>smiting, well-mounted, skilled in battle and fighting with bright lances.<br>Accompanied by the remnant of that excellent cavalry division (of the<br>Kauravas), he proceeded, desirous of slaying in battle the mighty Iravat.<br>That slayer of foes, viz., the valiant Iravat, excited with rage, and<br>advancing speedily from desire of slaying the Rakshasa, began to resist<br>him. Beholding him advance, the mighty Rakshasa speedily set himself<br>about for displaying his powers of illusion. The Rakshasa then created a<br>number of illusive chargers which were riden by terrible Rakshasas armed<br>with spears and axes. Those two thousand accomplished smiters advancing<br>with rage, were however, soon sent to the regions of Yama, (falling in<br>the encounter with Iravat's forces). And when the forces of both<br>perished, both of them, invincible in battle, encountered each other like<br>Vritra and Vasava. Beholding the Rakshasa, who was difficult of being<br>vanquished in battle, advancing towards him, the mighty Iravat, excited<br>with rage, began to check his onset. And when the Rakshasa approached him<br>nearer, Iravat with his sword quickly cut off his bow, as also each of<br>his shafts into five fragments. Seeing his bow cut off, the Rakshasa<br>speedily rose up into the welkin, confounding with his illusion the<br>enraged Iravat. Then Iravat also, difficult of approach, capable of<br>assuming any form at will, and having a knowledge of what are the vital<br>limbs of the body, rising up into the welkin, and confounding with his<br>illusion the Rakshasa began to cut off the latter's limbs in that battle<br>and thus were the limbs of the Rakshasa repeatedly cut into several<br>pieces.[441] [(Rakshasa ceases to be italicized at this point for a<br>couple of pages.&#8212;JBH)] Then the Rakshasa, however, O king, was re-born,<br>assuming a youthful appearance. Illusion is natural with them, and their<br>age and form are both dependent on their will. And the limbs of that<br>Rakshasa, O king, cut into pieces, presented a beautiful sight. Iravat,<br>excited with rage, repeatedly cut that mighty Rakshasa with his sharp<br>axe. 'The brave Rakshasa, thus cut into pieces like a tree by the mighty<br>Iravat, roared fiercely'. And those roars of his became deafening.<br>Mangled with the axe, the Rakshasa began to pour forth blood in torrents.<br>Then (Alamvusha), the mighty son of Rishyasringa, beholding his foe<br>blazing forth with energy, became infuriate with rage and himself put<br>forth his prowess in that combat. Assuming a prodigious and fierce form,<br>he endeavoured to seize the heroic son of Arjuna, viz., the renowned<br>Iravat. In the sight of all the combatants there present, beholding that<br>illusion of the wicked Rakshasa in the van of battle, Iravat became<br>inflamed with rage and adopted steps for himself having recourse to<br>illusion. And when that hero, never retreating from battle, became<br>inflamed with wrath, a Naga related to him by his mother's side, came to<br>him. Surrounded on all sides, in that battle by Nagas, that Naga, O king,<br>assumed a huge form mighty as Ananta himself. With diverse kinds of Nagas<br>then he covered the Rakshasa. While being covered by those Nagas, that<br>bull among Rakshasas reflected for a moment, and assuming the form of<br>Garuda, he devoured those snakes. When that Naga of his mother's line was<br>devoured through illusion, Iravat became confounded. And while in that<br>state, the Rakshasa slew him with his sword, Alamvusha felled on the<br>earth Iravat's head decked with ear-rings and graced with a diadem and<br>looking beautiful like a lotus or the moon.<br><br>"When the heroic son of Arjuna was thus slain by the Rakshasa, the<br>Dhartarashtra host with all the kings (in it) were freed from grief. In<br>that great battle that was so fierce, awful was the carnage that occurred<br>among both the divisions. Horses and elephants and foot-soldiers<br>entangled with one another, were slain by tuskers. And many steeds and<br>tuskers were slain by foot-soldiers. And in that general engagement<br>bodies of foot-soldiers and cars, and large numbers of horses belonging<br>both to thy army and theirs, were slain. O king, by car-warriors.<br>Meanwhile, Arjuna, not knowing that the son of his loins had been<br>slaughtered, slew in that battle many kings who had been protecting<br>Bhishma. And the warriors, O king, of thy army and the Srinjayas, by<br>thousands, poured out their lives as libations (on the fire of battle),<br>striking one another. And many car-warriors, with dishevelled hair, and<br>with swords and bows fallen from their grasp fought with their bare arms,<br>encountering one another. The mighty Bhishma also, with shafts capable of<br>penetrating into the very vitals, slew many mighty car-warriors and<br>caused the Pandava army to tremble (the while). By him were slain many<br>combatants in Yudhishthira's host, and many tuskers and cavalry-soldiers<br>and car-warriors and steeds. Beholding, O Bharata, the prowess of Bhishma<br>in that battle, it seemed to us that it was equal to that of Sakra<br>himself. And the prowess of Bhimasena, as also that of Parshata, was<br>hardly less, O Bharata, (than that of Bhishma). And so also the battle<br>fought by that great bowman (viz., Satyaki) of Satwata's race, was<br>equally fierce. Beholding, however, the prowess of Drona, the Pandavas<br>were struck with fear. Indeed they thought, 'Alone, Drona can slay us<br>with all our troops. What then should be said of him when he is<br>surrounded by a large body of warriors who for their bravery are renowned<br>over the world? Even this, O king, was what the Partha said, afflicted by<br>Drona. During the progress of that fierce battle, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, the brave combatants of neither army forgave their adversaries of<br>the other. O sire, the mighty bowmen of both thy army and that of the<br>Pandavas, inflamed with wrath, fought furiously with one another, as if<br>they were possessed of by the Rakshasas and demons. Indeed, he did not<br>see any one in the battle which was so destructive of lives and which was<br>considered as a battle of the demons, to take of life."
