                            [(Bhagavad Gita Chapter III)]<br><br>"Arjuna said,&#8212;'If devotion, O Janardana, is regarded by thee as superior<br>to work, why then, O Kesava, dost thou engage me in such dreadful work?<br>By equivocal words thou seemest to confound my understanding. Therefore,<br>tell (me) one thing definitely by which I may attain to what is good.'<br><br>"The Holy One said,&#8212;'It hath already been said by me, O sinless one,<br>that here are, in this world, two kinds of devotion; that of the Sankhyas<br>through knowledge and that of the yogins through work. A man doth not<br>acquire freedom from work from (only) the non-performance of work. Nor<br>doth he acquire final emancipation from only renunciation (of work). No<br>one can abide even for a moment without doing work.[151] That man of<br>deluded soul who, curbing the organs of sense, liveth mentally cherishing<br>the objects of sense, is said to be a dissembler. He however, O Arjuna,<br>who restraining (his) senses by his mind, engageth in devotion (in the<br>form) of work with the organs of work, and is free from attachment, is<br>distinguished (above all). (Therefore), do thou always apply yourself to<br>work, for action is better than inaction. Even the support of thy body<br>cannot be accomplished without work.[152] This world is fettered by all<br>work other than that which is (performed) for Sacrifice. (Therefore), O<br>son of Kunti, perform work for the sake of that, freed from<br>attachment.[153] In olden times, the Lord of Creation, creating men and<br>sacrifice together, said,&#8212;flourish by means of this (Sacrifice). Let<br>this (Sacrifice) be to you (all) the dispenser of all objects cherished<br>by you. Rear the gods with this, and let the gods (in return) rear you.<br>Thus fulfilling the mutual interest you will obtain that which is<br>beneficial (to you).[154] Propitiated with sacrifices the gods will<br>bestow on you the pleasures you desire. He who enjoyeth (himself) without<br>giving them what they have given, is assuredly a thief. The good who eat<br>the remnant of sacrifices are freed from all sins. Those unrighteous ones<br>incur sin who dress food for their own sake.&#8212;From food are all<br>creatures; and sacrifice is the outcome of work.[155] Know that work<br>proceeds from the Vedas; Vedas have proceeded from Him who hath no decay.<br>Therefore, the all-pervading Supreme Being is installed in<br>sacrifice.[156] He who conformeth not to this wheel that is thus<br>revolving, that man of sinful life delighting (the indulgence of) his<br>senses, liveth in vain, O Partha.[157] The man, however, that is attached<br>to self only, that is contented with self, and that is pleased in his<br>self,&#8212;hath no work (to do). He hath no concern whatever with action nor<br>with any omission here. Nor, amongst all creatures, is there any upon<br>whom his interest dependeth.[158] Therefore, always do work that should<br>be done, without attachment. The man who performeth work without<br>attachment, attaineth to the Supreme. By work alone, Janaka and others,<br>attained the accomplishment of their objects. Having regard also to the<br>observance by men of their duties, it behoveth thee to work. Whatever a<br>great man doth, is also done by vulgar people. Ordinary men follow the<br>ideal set by them (the great).[159] There is nothing whatever for me, O<br>Partha, to do in the three worlds, (since I have) nothing for me which<br>hath not been acquired; still I engage in action.[160] Because if at any<br>time I do not, without sloth, engage in action, men would follow my path,<br>O Partha, on all sides. The worlds would perish if I did not perform<br>work, and I should cause intermixture of castes and ruin these people. As<br>the ignorant work, O Bharata, having attachment to the performer, so<br>should a wise man work without being attached, desiring to make men<br>observant of their duties. A wise man should not cause confusion of<br>understanding amongst ignorant persons, who have attachment to work<br>itself; (on the other hand) he should (himself) acting with devotion<br>engage them to all (kinds of) work. All works are, in every way, done by<br>the qualities of nature. He, whose mind is deluded by egoism, however,<br>regards himself as the actor.[161] But he, O mighty-armed one, who<br>knoweth the distinction (of self) from qualities and work, is not<br>attached to work, considering that it is his senses alone (and not his<br>self) that engage in their objects.[162] Those who are deluded by the<br>qualities of nature, become attached to the works done by the qualities.<br>A person of perfect knowledge should not bewilder those men of imperfect<br>knowledge.[163] Devoting all work to me, with (thy) mind directed to<br>self, engage in battle, without desire, without affection and with thy<br>(heart's) weakness dispelled.[164] Those men who always follow this<br>opinion of mine with faith and without cavil attain to final emancipation<br>even by work. But they who cavil at and do not follow this opinion of<br>mine, know, that, bereft of all knowledge and without discrimination,<br>they are ruined. Even a wise man acts according to his own nature. All<br>living beings follow (their own) nature. What then would restraint avail?<br>The senses have, as regards the objects of the senses, either affection<br>or aversion fixed. One should not submit to these, for they are obstacles<br>in one's way.[165] One's own duty, even if imperfectly performed, is<br>better than being done by other even if well performed. Death in<br>(performance of) one's own duty is preferable. (The adoption of) the duty<br>of another carries fear (with it).<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'Impelled by whom, O son of the Vrishni race, doth a man<br>commit sin, even though unwilling and as if constrained by force'?<br><br>"The Holy One said,&#8212;'It is desire, it is wrath, born of the attribute of<br>passion; it is all devouring, it is very sinful. Know this to be the foe<br>in this world.[166] As fire is enveloped by smoke, a mirror by dust, the<br>foetus by the womb, so is this enveloped by desire. Knowledge, O son of<br>Kunti, is enveloped by this constant foe of the wise in the form of<br>desire which is insatiable and like a fire. The senses, the mind and the<br>understanding are said to be its abode. With these it deludeth the<br>embodied self, enveloping (his) knowledge. Therefore, restraining (thy)<br>senses first, O bull of Bharata's race, cast off this wicked thing, for<br>it destroyeth knowledge derived from instruction and meditation.[167] It<br>hath been said that the senses are superior (to the body which is inert).<br>Superior to the senses is the mind. Superior to the mind is the<br>knowledge. But which is superior to knowledge is He.[168] Thus knowing<br>that which is superior to knowledge and restraining (thy) self by self,<br>slay, O mighty-armed one, the enemy in the shape of desire which is<br>difficult to conquer.'"
