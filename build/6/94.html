                            Sanjaya said, "Having in that battle made all those warriors (of thy<br>army) turn their faces from the field, the Rakshasa then, O chief of the<br>Bharatas, rushed at Duryodhana, desirous of slaying him. Beholding him<br>rushing with great impetuosity towards the king, many warriors of thy<br>army, incapable of defeat in battle, rushed towards him (in return) from<br>desire of slaying him. Those mighty car-warriors, drawing their bows that<br>measured full six cubits long, and uttering loud roars like a herd of<br>lions, all rushed together against that single warrior. And surrounding<br>him on all sides, they covered him with their arrowy showers like the<br>clouds covering the mountain-breast with torrents of rain in autumn.<br>Deeply pierced with those arrows and much pained, he resembled then an<br>elephant pierced with the hook. Quickly then he soared up into the<br>firmament like Garuda. And (while there) he uttered many loud roars like<br>the autumnal clouds, making the welkin and all the points of the compass,<br>cardinal and subsidiary, resounded with those fierce cries. Hearing those<br>roars of the Rakshasa, O chief of the Bharatas, king Yudhishthira then,<br>addressing Bhima, said unto that chastiser of foes these words, 'The<br>noise that we hear uttered by the fiercely-roaring Rakshasa, without<br>doubt, indicates that he is battling with the mighty car-warriors of the<br>Dhartarashtra army. I see also that the burden has proved heavier than<br>what that bull among Rakshasas is able to bear. The grandsire, too,<br>excited with rage, is ready to slaughter the Panchalas. For protecting<br>them Phalguni is battling with the foe. O thou of mighty arms hearing now<br>of these two tasks, both of which demand prompt attention, go and give<br>succour to Hidimva's son who is placed in a position of very great<br>danger.' Listening to these words of his brother, Vrikodara, with great<br>speed, proceeded, frightening all the kings with his leonine roars, with<br>great impetuosity, O king, like the ocean itself during the period of the<br>new full moon. Him followed Satyadhriti and Sauchiti difficult of being<br>vanquished in battle, and Srenimat, and Vasudana and the powerful son of<br>the ruler of Kasi, and many car-warriors headed by Abhimanyu, as also<br>those mighty car-warriors, viz., the sons of Draupadi, and the valiant<br>Kshatradeva, and Kshatradharman, and Nila, the ruler of the low<br>countries, at the head of his own forces. And these surrounded the son of<br>Hidimva with a large division of cars (for aiding him).[446] And they<br>advanced to the rescue of Ghatotkacha, that prince of the Rakshasas, with<br>the six thousand elephants, always infuriate and accomplished in smiting.<br>And with their loud leonine roars, and the clatter of their car-wheels,<br>and with the tread of their horse's hoofs, they made the very earth to<br>tremble. Hearing the din of those advancing warriors the faces of thy<br>troops who were filled with anxiety in consequence of their fear of<br>Bhimasena became pale. Leaving Ghatotkacha then they all fled away. Then<br>commenced in that part of the field a dreadful battle between those<br>high-souled warriors and thine, both of whom were unretreating. Mighty<br>car-warriors, hurling diverse kinds of the weapons, chased and smote one<br>another. That fierce battle striking terror into the hearts of the timid,<br>was such that the different classes of combatants became entangled with<br>one another. Horses engaged with elephants and foot-soldiers with<br>car-warriors. And challenging one another, O king, they engaged in the<br>fight.[447] And in consequence of that clash of cars, steeds, elephants,<br>and foot-soldiers, a thick dust appeared, raised by the car-wheels and<br>the tread (of those combatants and animals). And that dust, thick and of<br>the colour of reddish smoke, shrouded the field of battle. And the<br>combatants were unable to distinguish their own from the foe. Sire<br>recognised not the son, and son recognised not the sire, in that dreadful<br>engagement which made the hair stand on end and in which no consideration<br>was shown (by any one for any body). And the noise made by the hissing<br>weapons and the shouting combatants resembled, O chief of Bharata's race,<br>that made by departed spirits (in the infernal regions). And there flowed<br>a river whose current consisted of the blood of elephants and steeds and<br>men. And the hair (of the combatants) formed its weeds and moss. And in<br>that battle heads falling from the trunks of men made a loud noise like<br>that of a falling shower of stones. And the earth was strewn with the<br>headless trunks of human beings, with mangled bodies of elephants and<br>with the hacked limbs of steeds. And mighty car-warriors chased one<br>another for smiting one another down, and hurled diverse kinds of<br>weapons. Steeds, urged by their riders and falling upon steeds, dashed<br>against one another and fell down deprived of life. And men, with eyes<br>red in wrath, rushing against men and striking one another with their<br>chests, smote one another down. And elephants, urged by their guides<br>against hostile elephants, slew their compeers in that battle, with the<br>points of their tusks. Covered with blood in consequence of their wounds<br>and decked with standards (on their backs), elephants were entangled with<br>elephants and looked like masses of clouds charged with lightning. And<br>some amongst them mounted (by others) with the points of their tusks, and<br>some with their frontal globes split with lances, ran hither and thither<br>with loud shrieks like masses of roaring clouds. And some amongst them<br>with their trunks lopped off,[448] and others with mangled limbs, dropped<br>down in that dreadful battle like mountains shorn of their wings.[449]<br>Other huge elephants, copiously shedding blood from their flanks, ripped<br>open by compeers, looked like mountains with (liquified) red chalk<br>running down their sides (after a shower).[450] Others, slain with shafts<br>or pierced with lances and deprived of their riders, looked like<br>mountains deprived of their crests.[451]Some amongst them, possessed by<br>wrath and blinded (with fury) in consequence of the juice (trickling down<br>their temples and cheeks).[452] and no longer restrained with the hook,<br>crushed cars and steeds and foot-soldiers in that battle by hundreds. And<br>so steeds, attacked by horsemen with bearded darts and lances, rushed<br>against their assailants, as if agitating the points of the compass.<br>Car-warriors of noble parentage and prepared to lay down their lives,<br>encountering car-warriors, fought fearlessly, relying upon their utmost<br>might. The combatants, O king, seeking glory or heaven, struck one<br>another in that awful press, as if in a marriage by self-choice. During<br>however, that dreadful battle making the hair stand on end, the<br>Dhartarashtra troops generally were made to run their backs on the field."
