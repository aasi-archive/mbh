                            "Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;'Tell me truly, O Sanjaya, the names of all the<br>Varshas, and of all the mountains, and also of all those that dwell on<br>those mountains.<br><br>"Sanjaya said,&#8212;'On the south of Sweta and the north of Nishadha, is the<br>Varsha, called Romanaka. The men that are born there are all of white<br>complexion, of good parentage, and handsome features. And the men born<br>there are also all without enemies. And they live, O king, for eleven<br>thousand and five hundred years, being ever of cheerful hearts. On the<br>south of Nishadha is the Varsha called Hiranmaya where is the river<br>called Hiranwati. There, O king, liveth that foremost of birds named<br>Garuda. And the people there, O monarch, are all followers of the<br>Yakshas, wealthy, and of handsome features. And, O king, the men there<br>are endued with great strength and have: cheerful hearts. And they live<br>for twelve thousand and five hundred years., O king, which is the measure<br>of their lives. The mountains of Sringavat,[56] O ruler of men, have<br>three beautiful summits. One of these is made of jewels and gems, another<br>is very wonderful, being made of all kinds of gems and adorned with<br>palatial mansions. There the self-luminous lady named Sandili always<br>liveth. On the north of Sringavat and up to the margin of the sea, O<br>king, the Varsha called Airavat. And because this jewelled mountain is<br>there, therefore is this Varsha superior to all. The sun giveth no heat<br>there and men are not subject to decay. And the moon there, with the<br>stars, becoming the only source of light, covereth (the firmament).<br>Possessing the radiance and complexion of the lotus, and endued with eyes<br>that resemble lotus-petals, the men born there have the fragrance of the<br>lotus. With winkless eyes, and agreeable scent (emanating from their<br>bodies), they go without food and have their senses under control. They<br>are all fallen from the region of the celestials, and are all, O king,<br>without sin of any kind. And they live, O monarch, for thirteen thousand<br>years, that being. O best of the Bharatas, the measure of their lives.<br>And so on the north of the milky ocean, the Lord Hari of unlimited<br>puissance dwelleth on his car made of gold. That vehicle is endued with<br>eight wheels, with numerous supernatural creatures stationed on it, and<br>having the speed of the mind. And its complexion is that of fire, and it<br>is endued with mighty energy and adorned with Jamvunada gold. He is the<br>Lord of all creatures, and is possessed, O bull of Bharata's race, of<br>every kind of prosperity. In him the universe merges (when dissolution<br>comes), and from him it again emanates (when the creative desire seizes<br>him). He is the actor, and it is He that makes all others act. He, O<br>monarch, is earth, water, space, air, and fire. He is Sacrifice's self<br>unto all creatures, and fire is His mouth."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"The high-souled king Dhritarashtra, thus<br>addressed by Sanjaya, became, O monarch, absorbed in meditation about his<br>sons. Endued with great energy, he then, having reflected, said these<br>words: 'Without doubt, O Suta's son, it is Time that destroyeth the<br>universe. And it is Time that again createth everything. Nothing here is<br>eternal. It is Nara and Narayana, endued with omniscience, that<br>destroyeth all creatures.[57] The gods speak of him as Vaikuntha (of<br>immeasurable puissance), while men call him Vishnu (one that pervadeth<br>the Universe)!'"
