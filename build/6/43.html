                            Sanjaya said,&#8212;"Beholding Dhananjaya then to take up once again (his)<br>arrows and Gandiva, the mighty car-warriors (of the Pandava party)<br>uttered a tremendous shout. And those heroes, viz., the Pandavas and the<br>Somakas, and those who followed them, filled with joy, blew their<br>sea-born conches. And drums, and Pesis, and Karkachas, and cow-horns were<br>beaten and blown together, and the uproar made was very loud. And then, O<br>ruler of men, there came the gods, with Gandharvas and the Pitris, and<br>the hosts of Siddhas and Charanas, from desire of witnessing (the sight).<br>And Rishis highly blessed came there in a body with him (Indra) of a<br>hundred sacrifices at their head, for beholding that great slaughter.<br>Then, O king, beholding the two armies, that looked like two oceans,<br>ready for the encounter and continuously moving, the heroic king<br>Yudhishthira, the Just, putting off his coat of mail and casting aside<br>his excellent weapon and quickly descending from his car, with joined<br>hands, proceeded on foot, eyeing the grandsire, with restrained speech,<br>facing the east, towards the direction where the hostile host was<br>(standing).[309] And seeing him proceed (thus), Dhananjaya, the son of<br>Kunti, speedily alighting from his car, followed him, accompanied by his<br>(other) brothers. And the Lord Vasudeva also followed him behind. And the<br>principal kings too (of his army), filled with anxiety, followed in the<br>same path.<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'What is this act of thine, O king, that abandoning thy<br>brothers, thou proceedest on foot, face eastwards, to the hostile host?'<br><br>"Bhimasena said, 'Where wilt thou go, O king of kings, having cast off<br>thy coat of mail and weapons, towards the warriors of the foe cased in<br>mail, and leaving thy brothers, O ruler of earth?'<br><br>"Nakula said, 'Thou art my eldest brother, O Bharata, (beholding) thee<br>proceeding in this way, fear troubleth my bosom. Tell (us), whither wilt<br>thou go?'<br><br>"Sahadeva said, 'When these hostile divisions, terrible and numerous, are<br>here with whom we are to fight, whither dost thou go, O king, in the<br>direction of our foes?'<br><br>Sanjaya continued, "Though thus addressed by his brothers, O son of<br>Kuru's race, Yudhishthira of restrained speech said nothing but continued<br>to proceed. Unto them (then), the high-souled Vasudeva of great wisdom<br>smilingly said,&#8212;His object is known to me. Having paid his respects to<br>all his superiors (such as) Bhishma, Drona, and Kripa, and Salya also, he<br>will fight the foe. It is heard in histories of olden times that he who,<br>having paid his respects according to the ordinance unto his preceptors,<br>revered in years and his kinsmen, fighteth with those that are his<br>superiors, is sure to obtain victory in battle. Even that is my<br>opinion.&#8212;When Krishna was saying this, among the ranks of<br>Dhritarashtra's son, a loud uproar of Alas, and Oh arose, but the other<br>(army) remained perfectly still. Beholding Yudhishthira, the heroic<br>warriors of Dhritarashtra's Son conversed with one another saying,&#8212;'This<br>one is an infamous wretch of his race. It is plain that this king is<br>coming in terror towards Bhishma's side. Yudhishthira, with his brothers,<br>hath become a seeker after (Bhishma's) shelter. When Dhananjaya, however,<br>is (his) protector, and Pandu's son Vrikodara, and Nakula, and Sahadeva<br>also, why doth the (eldest) son of Pandu come (hither) in fear? Though<br>celebrated in the world, this one, however, could never have been born in<br>the Kshatriya order, since he is weak and his bosom is filled with fear<br>(at the prospect) of battle.' Then those warriors all praised the<br>Kauravas. And all of them, becoming rejoiced, with cheerful hearts waved<br>their garments. And, O monarch, all the warriors there (then) censured<br>Yudhishthira with all his brothers and along with Kesava too. Then the<br>Kaurava army, having said Fie to Yudhishthira, soon again, O monarch,<br>became perfectly still,&#8212;What will this king say? What will Bhishma say<br>in reply? What will Bhima boastful of his powers in battle, (say), and<br>what Krishna and Arjuna? What, indeed, hath (Yudhishthira) to say?&#8212;Great<br>was the curiosity then, O king, of both the armies in respect of<br>Yudhishthira. The king (meanwhile), penetrating the hostile array<br>bristling with arrows and darts, proceeded quickly towards Bhishma,<br>surrounded by his brothers. Seizing his feet with his two hands, the<br>royal son of Pandu then said unto Santanu's son Bhishma who was there<br>ready for battle, (these words).<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'I salute thee, O invincible one. With thee we will<br>do battle. Grant (us) thy permission in that matter. Give (us) also (thy)<br>blessing."<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'If, O lord of the earth, thou hadst not, in this battle<br>come to me thus, I would have, O great king, cursed thee, O Bharata, for<br>bringing about thy defeat. I am gratified (with thee), O son. Do battle,<br>and obtain victory, O son of Pandu, What else may be desired by thee,<br>obtain thou in battle. Solicit also the boon, O son of Pritha, which thou<br>desirest to have from us. If it happens so, O great king, then defeat<br>will not be thine. A man is the slave of wealth, but wealth is no one's<br>slave. This is very true, O king. I have been bound by the Kauravas with<br>(their) wealth. It is for this, O son of Kuru's race, that like a eunuch<br>I am uttering these words, viz.,&#8212;Bound I am by the Kauravas with wealth.<br>Battle excepted, what dost thou desire?[310]'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O thou of great wisdom, do thou, desirous of my<br>welfare, from day to day, consult my interests. Do battle, however for<br>the sake of the Kauravas. Even this is always my prayer (to thee).'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O king, O son of Kuru's race, what aid can I render thee<br>in this? I shall, of course, fight for (thy) foes. Tell me what thou hast<br>to say.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Therefore, O Sire, I ask thee, I bow to thee, O<br>grandsire, how shall we, in battle, vanquish thee that art invincible?<br>Tell me this that is for my benefit, if indeed, thou seest any good in<br>it."<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I do not, O son of Kunti, see the person who, even if he<br>were the chief of the celestials himself, can defeat me in battle when I<br>fight.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'My salutations to thee, O grandsire. Therefore, do I<br>ask thee (this). Tell us how thy own death may be compassed by foes in<br>battle.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I do not see the person, O sire, who can vanquish me in<br>battle. The time also of my death is not yet come to me once again."<br><br>Sanjaya continued,&#8212;"Then, O son of Kuru's race, Yudhishthira, once more<br>saluting him, accepted Bhishma's words with a bend of his head. And that<br>mighty-armed one then proceeded towards the car of the preceptor ( Drona)<br>through the midst of all the soldiers who were eyeing him, accompanied by<br>his brothers. Then saluting Drona and walking round him, the king spoke<br>to that invincible warrior words that were for his own benefit.[311]<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'I ask thee, O invincible one, how I may fight<br>without incurring sin, and how, with thy permission, O regenerate one, I<br>may vanquish all my foes?[312]<br><br>"Drona said, 'If, having resolved to fight, thou hadst not come to me<br>(thus), I would have cursed thee. O king, for thy complete overthrow. I<br>am, however, gratified, O Yudhishthira, and honoured by thee, O sinless<br>one. I permit thee, fight and obtain victory. I will also fulfil thy<br>wish. Say what thou hast to say. Under these circumstances, battle<br>excepted, what dost thou wish? A man is the slave of wealth, but wealth<br>is not one's slave. This is quite true, O king! Bound I have been with<br>(their) wealth by the Kauravas! It is for this that like a eunuch I shall<br>fight for the sake of the Kauravas. It is for this that like a eunuch I<br>am uttering these words&#8212;Battle excepted, what dost thou wish? I shall<br>fight for the sake of the Kauravas, but will pray for thy victory.'[313]<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Pray for my victory, O regenerate one, and counsel<br>what is for my good. Fight, however, for the Kauravas. This is the boon<br>solicited by me.'<br><br>"Drona said, 'Victory, O king, is certain for thee that hast Hari for thy<br>counsellor. I (also) grant thee that thou wilt vanquish thy foes in<br>battle. Thither where righteousness is, thither is Krishna, and thither<br>where Krishna is, thither is victory. Go, fight, O son of Kunti! Ask me,<br>what shall I say unto thee?'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'I ask thee, O foremost of regenerate ones, listen to<br>what I have to say. How shall we in battle vanquish thee that art<br>invincible?'<br><br>"Drona said, 'As long as I will fight, so long victory can never be<br>thine. (Therefore) O king, seek with thy brothers, for my speedy<br>slaughter.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Alas, for this, O thou of mighty arms, tell (us) the<br>means of thy death. O preceptor, prostrating myself I ask thee this. (My)<br>salutations to thee."<br><br>"Drona said, 'The foe, O sire, I see not who may slay me while standing<br>in battle I am engaged in fight, with wrath excited, and scattering (my)<br>arrowy showers continually. Except when addrest for death O king, having<br>abandoned my arms and withdrawn (in Yoga meditation) from surrounding<br>sights, none will be able to slay me. This that I tell thee is true. I<br>also tell thee truly that I will cast off my arms in battle, having heard<br>something very disagreeable from some one of credible speech.&#8212;'"<br><br>Sanjaya continued, "Hearing these words, O king, of the wise son of<br>Bharadwaja, and honouring the preceptor, (Yudhishthira then) proceeded<br>towards the son of Saradwat. And saluting Kripa and walking round him, O<br>king, Yudhishthira, accomplished in speech, said these words unto that<br>warrior of great valour.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Obtaining thy permission, O preceptor, I will fight<br>without incurring sin, and permitted by thee, O sinless one, I will<br>vanquish all (my) foes."<br><br>"Kripa said, 'If having resolved on fight, thou hadst not come to me<br>(thus), I would have cursed thee, O king, for thy complete overthrow. A<br>man is the slave of wealth, but wealth is no one's slave. This is very<br>true, O king, and bound I have been with wealth by the Kauravas. I must,<br>O king, fight for their sake. This is my opinion. I therefore, speak like<br>a eunuch in asking thee,&#8212;Battle excepted, what dost thou desire?'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Alas, I ask thee, therefore., O preceptor, listen to<br>my words.&#8212;Saying this, the king, greatly agitated and deprived of his<br>sense, stood silent."<br><br>Sanjaya continued.&#8212;"Understanding, however, what he intended to say,<br>Gautama (Kripa) replied to him, saying,&#8212;I am incapable of being slain, O<br>king. Fight, and obtain victory. I am gratified with thy coming. Rising<br>every day [from bed] I will pray for thy victory, O monarch. I say this<br>to thee truly.&#8212;Hearing, O king, these words of Gautama, and paying him<br>due honours, the king proceeded thither where the ruler of the Madra was.<br>Saluting Salya and walking round him the king said unto that invincible<br>warrior those words that were for his own benefit.<br><br>'Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'Obtaining thy permission, O invincible one, I will<br>fight without incurring sin, and permitted by thee, O king, I will<br>vanquish (my) valourous foes.'[314]&#8212;<br><br>"Salya said, 'If, having resolved on fight, thou hadst not come to me<br>(thus), I would have, O king, cursed thee for thy overthrow in battle. I<br>am gratified (with thee) and honoured (by thee). Let it be as thou<br>wishest. I grant thee permission, fight and obtain victory. Speak, O<br>hero, for what hast thou any need? What shalt I give thee? Under these<br>circumstances, O king, battle excepted, what dost thou desire? A man is<br>the slave of wealth but wealth is no one's slave. This is true, O king.<br>Bound I have been with wealth by the Kauravas, O nephew, it is for this<br>that I am speaking to thee like a eunuch,&#8212;I will accomplish the desire<br>thou mayst cherish. Battle excepted, what dost thou wish.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Think, O king, daily of what is for my great good.<br>Fight, according to thy pleasure, for the sake of the foe. This is the<br>boon that I solicit.'<br><br>"Salya said, 'Under these circumstances, say, O best of kings what aid<br>shall I render thee? I shall, of course, fight for the sake of (thy)<br>enemy, for I have been made one of their party by the Kauravas with their<br>wealth.[315]<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Even that is my boon, O Salya, which was solicited<br>by me during the preparations (for the fight). The energy of the Suta's<br>son (Karna) should be weakened by thee in battle.'<br><br>"Salya said, 'This thy wish, O Yudhishthira, shall be accomplished, O son<br>of Kunti. Go, fight according to thy pleasure. I shall look after thy<br>victory."<br><br>'Sanjaya continued, "Having obtained the permission of his maternal<br>uncle, the ruler of the Madra, the son of Kunti, surrounded by his<br>brothers, came out of that vast army. Vasudeva then went to Radha's son<br>on the field of battle. And the elder brother of Gada, for the sake of<br>the Pandavas, then said to Karna,&#8212;It hath been heard by me, O Karna,<br>that from hatred of Bhishma thou wilt not fight. Come to our side, O son<br>of Radha, and (stay with us) as long as Bhishma is not slain. After<br>Bhishma is slain, O son of Radha, thou mayst then again engage in battle<br>on Duryodhana's side, if thou hast no preference for any of the<br>parties.&#8212;'<br><br>"Karna said, 'I will not do anything that is disagreeable to<br>Dhritarashtra's son, O Kesava. Devoted to Duryodhana's good, know that I<br>have cast off my life (for him).&#8212;Hearing these words (of Karna), Krishna<br>ceased, O Bharata, and reunited himself with the sons of Pandu headed by<br>Yudhishthira. Then amid all the warriors the eldest son of Pandu, loudly<br>exclaimed,&#8212;He who will choose us, him we shall choose for our<br>ally!&#8212;Casting his eyes then upon them, Yuyutsu said these words, with a<br>cheerful heart, unto Kunti's son king Yudhishthira the Just,&#8212;I will<br>fight under thee in battle, for the sake of you all, with the sons of<br>Dhritarashtra, if, O king, thou wilt accept me, sinless one.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Come, come, all of us will fight with thy foolish<br>brothers. O Yuyutsu, both Vasudeva and we all say to thee&#8212;I accept thee,<br>O thou of mighty arms, fight for my cause. On thee rests, it seems, the<br>thread of Dhritarashtra's line as also his funeral cake. O prince, O thou<br>of great splendour, accept us that accept thee. The wrathful Duryodhana<br>of wicked understanding will cease to live.'"<br><br>Sanjaya continued, 'Yuvutsu then, abandoning the Kurus thy sons, went<br>over to the army of the Pandavas, with beat of drums and cymbals. Then<br>king Yudhishthira of mighty arms, filled with joy, again put on his<br>shining coat of mail of golden effulgence. And those bulls among men then<br>mounted their respective cars. And they counter-arrayed their troops in<br>battle-array as before. And they caused drums and cymbals in many<br>hundreds to be sounded. And those bulls among men also set up diverse<br>leonine roars.[316] And beholding those tigers among men, viz., the sons<br>of Pandu, on their cars, the kings (on their side) with Dhrishtadyumna<br>and others, once more set up shouts of joy. And beholding the nobility of<br>the sons of Pandu who had paid due honour to those that were deserving of<br>honour, all the kings there present applauded them highly. And the<br>monarchs, talked with one another about the friendship, the compassion,<br>and the kindness to kinsmen, displayed at the proper season by those<br>high-souled personages. Excellent,&#8212;Excellent,&#8212;were the delightful words<br>everywhere bruited about, coupled with eulogistic hymns about those<br>famous men. And in consequence of this the minds and hearts of every one<br>there were attracted towards them. And the Mlechchhas and the Aryas there<br>who witnessed or heard of that behaviour of the sons of Pandu, all wept<br>with choked voices. And those warriors then, endued with great energy,<br>caused large drums and Pushkaras by hundreds upon hundreds to be sounded<br>and also blew their conches all white as the milk of cows.'"
