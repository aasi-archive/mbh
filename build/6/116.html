                            Dhritarashtra said, "How, O Sanjaya, did Santanu's son Bhishma of mighty<br>energy fight on the tenth day of battle, with the Pandavas and the<br>Srinjayas? How also did the Kurus resist the Pandavas in battle? Describe<br>to me the great battle fought by Bhishma, that ornament of battle."<br><br>Sanjaya said, "I will presently describe to thee, O Bharata, how the<br>Kauravas fought with the Pandavas, and how that battle took place. Day<br>after day many mighty car-warriors of thy army, excited with wrath, were<br>despatched to the other world by the diadem-decked (Arjuna) with his<br>great weapons. The ever-victorious Kuru warrior Bhishma also, agreeably<br>to his vow, always caused a great carnage among the Partha army. O<br>chastiser of foes, beholding Bhishma, fighting at the head of the Kurus,<br>and Arjuna also fighting at the head of the Panchalas, we could not say<br>truly on which side the victory would declare itself. On the tenth day of<br>battle, when Bhishma and Arjuna encountered each other, awful was the<br>carnage that took place. On that day, O scorcher of foes, Santanu's son,<br>Bhishma, conversant with high and mighty weapons, repeatedly slew<br>thousands upon thousands of warriors. Many, O Bharata, whose names and<br>families were not known, but who, endued with great bravery, were<br>unretreating from battle, were on that day slain by Bhishma. Scorching<br>the Pandava army for ten days, Bhishma of virtuous soul, gave up all<br>desire of protecting his life. Wishing his own slaughter presently at the<br>head of his troops,&#8212;No more shall I slay large numbers of foremost of<br>warriors.&#8212;thought thy mighty-armed sire Devavrata. And seeing<br>Yudhishthira near him, O king, he addressed him, saying, 'O Yudhishthira,<br>O thou of great wisdom, O thou that art acquainted with every branch of<br>learning, listen to these righteous and heaven-leading words, O sire,<br>that I say. O Bharata, I no longer desire to protect, O sire, this body<br>of mine. I have passed much time in slaying large numbers of men in<br>battle. If thou wishest to do what is agreeable to me, strive to slay me,<br>placing Partha with the Panchalas and the Srinjayas at thy van'.<br>Ascertaining this to be his intention, king Yudhishthira of true sight<br>proceeded to battle with the Srinjayas (for his support). Then<br>Dhrishtadyumna, O king, and Pandu's son Yudhishthira, having heard those<br>words of Bhishma urged their array on. And Yudhishthira said, 'Advance!<br>Fight! Vanquish Bhishma in battle. Ye all will be protected by that<br>conqueror of foes, viz., Jishnu of unbaffled aim. And this great bowman,<br>this generalissimo (of our forces), viz., the son of Prishata, as also<br>Bhima, will assuredly protect you. Ye Srinjayas, entertain no fear today<br>of Bhishma in battle. Without doubt, we will vanquish Bhishma today,<br>placing Sikhandin in our van'. Having, on the tenth day of battle, made<br>such a vow, the Pandavas, resolved to (conquer or) go to heaven,<br>advanced, blinded by rage, with Sikhandin and Dhananjaya the son of Pandu<br>to the fore. And they made the most vigorous efforts for the overthrow of<br>Bhishma. Then diverse kings, of great might, urged by thy son, and<br>accompanied by Drona and his son and a large force, and the mighty<br>Dussasana at the head of all his uterine brothers, proceeded towards<br>Bhishma staying in the midst of that battle. Then those brave warriors of<br>thy army, placing Bhishma of high vows in their van, battled with the<br>Parthas headed by Sikhandin. Supported by the Chedis and the Panchalas,<br>the ape-bannered Arjuna, placing Sikhandin ahead, proceeded towards<br>Bhishma, the son of Santanu. And the grandson of Sini battled with<br>Drona's son, and Dhrishtaketu with the descendant of Puru, and Yudhamanyu<br>with thy son Duryodhana at the head of his followers. And Virata, at the<br>head of his forces, encountered Jayadratha supported by his own troops.<br>And Vardhakshatra's heir, O chastiser of foes, encountered thy son<br>Chitrasena armed with excellent bow and arrows.[479] And Yudhishthira<br>proceeded against the mighty bowman Salya at the head of his troops. And<br>Bhimasena, well-protected, proceeded against the elephant-division (of<br>the Kaurava army). And Dhrishtadyumna, the prince of Panchala, excited<br>with fury and accompanied by his brothers, proceeded against Drona, that<br>foremost of all wielders of weapons, invincible, and irresistible. That<br>chastiser of foes, viz., prince Vrihadvala, bearing on his standard the<br>device of the lion, proceeded against Subhadra's son whose standard bore<br>the device of the Karnikara flower. Thy sons, accompanied by many kings,<br>proceeded against Sikhandin and Dhananjaya the son of Pritha, from desire<br>of slaughtering both of them. When the combatants of both armies rushed<br>against each other with awful prowess, the earth shook (under their<br>tread). Beholding Santanu's son in battle, the divisions of thy army and<br>of the foe, O Bharata, became mingled with one another. Tremendous was<br>the din, O Bharata, that arose there of those warriors burning with rage<br>and rushing against each other. And it was heard on all sides, O king.<br>With the blare of conchs and the leonine shouts of the soldiers, the<br>uproar became awful. The splendour, equal to that of either the Sun or<br>the Moon, of bracelets and diadems of all the heroic kings, became<br>dimmed. And the dust that rose looked like a cloud, the flash of bright<br>weapons constituting its lightning. And the twang of bows, the whiz of<br>arrows, the blare of conchs, the loud beat of drums, and the rattle of<br>cars, of both the armies, constituted the fierce roar of those clouds.<br>And the welkin, over the field of battle, in consequence of the bearded<br>darts, the javelins, the swords and showers of arrows of both armies, was<br>darkened. And car-warriors, and horsemen felled horsemen, in that<br>dreadful battle. And elephants killed elephants, and foot-soldiers slew<br>foot-soldiers. And the battle that took place there for Bhishma's sake,<br>between the Kurus and the Pandavas, O tiger among men, was fierce in the<br>extreme, like that between two hawks for a piece of flesh. Engaged in<br>battle, that encounter between those combatants desirous of slaughtering<br>and vanquishing one another, was extremely dreadful."
