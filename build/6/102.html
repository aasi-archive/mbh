                            Dhritarashtra said, "How, O Sanjaya, did Alamvusha resist in combat the<br>heroic son of Arjuna smiting many of our mighty car-warriors in battle?<br>And how also did that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son of<br>Subhadra, fight with Rishyasringa's son? Tell me all this in detail,<br>exactly as it happened in that fight. What also did Bhima, that foremost<br>of car-warriors, and the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, and Nakula, and Sahadeva<br>and the mighty car-warrior Satyaki, and Dhananjaya, do with my troops in<br>battle? Tell me all this truly, O Sanjaya, for thou art skilled (in<br>narration)."<br><br>Sanjaya said, "I will presently describe to thee, O sire, the awful<br>battle that took place between that foremost of the Rakshasas and the son<br>of Subhadra. I will also describe to thee the prowess that Arjuna put<br>forth in battle, and Bhimasena the son of Pandu and Nakula, and Sahadeva,<br>as also the warriors of thy army headed by Bhishma and Drona, all of whom<br>fearlessly achieved wonderful feats of diverse kinds, Alamvusha, uttering<br>loud shouts and repeatedly roaring at Abhimanyu, rushed impetuously<br>against that mighty car-warrior in battle, saying, 'Wait,<br>Wait'&#8212;Abhimanyu also, repeatedly roaring like a lion, rushed with at<br>great force at that mighty bowman, viz., the son of Rishyasringa, who was<br>an implacable foe of the former's sire. Soon then those two foremost of<br>car-warriors, man and Rakshasa, on their cars, encountered each other,<br>like a god and Danava. That best of Rakshasa were endued with powers of<br>illusion, while Phalguni's son was acquainted with celestial weapons.<br>Then Abhimanyu, O king, pierced Rishyasringa's son in that battle with<br>three sharp shafts and once more with five. Alamvusha, also, excited with<br>wrath, speedily pierced Abhimanyu in the chest with nine shafts like a<br>guide piercing an elephant with hooks. Then, O Bharata, that wanderer of<br>the night, endued with great activity, afflicted Arjuna's son in that<br>combat with a thousand arrows. Then Abhimanyu excited with rage, pierced<br>that prince of the Rakshasas in his wide chest with nine straight shafts<br>of great sharpness. Piercing through his body these penetrated into his<br>very vitals. And that best of Rakshasas, his limbs mangled by them,<br>looked beautiful like a mountain overgrown with flowering Kinsukas.<br>Bearing those shafts of golden wings on his body, that mighty prince of<br>Rakshasas looked radiant like a mountain on fire. Then the vindictive son<br>of Rishyasringa, inflamed with wrath, covered Abhimanyu, who was equal<br>unto Mahendra himself, with clouds of winged arrows. Those sharp shafts<br>resembling the rods of Yama himself, shot by him, pierced Abhimanyu<br>through and entered the earth. And similarly the gold-decked arrows shot<br>by Arjuna's son, piercing Alamvusha through, entered the earth. The son<br>of Subhadra then, in that battle, with his straight shafts, obliged the<br>Rakshasa to turn his back upon the field, like Sakra repulsing Maya in<br>days of old. That scorcher of foes, the Rakshasa, then, thus repulsed and<br>struck repeatedly by his adversary, exhibited his great powers of<br>illusion by causing a thick darkness to set in. Then all the combatants<br>there, O king, were covered by that darkness. Neither could Abhimanyu be<br>seen, nor could friends be distinguished from foes in that battle.<br>Abhimanyu, however, beholding that thick and awful gloom, invoked into<br>existence. O son of Kuru's race, the blazing solar weapon. Thereupon, O<br>king, the universe once more became visible. And thus he neutralised the<br>illusion of that wicked Rakshasa. Then that prince of men, excited with<br>wrath and endued with great energy, covered that foremost of Rakshasa in<br>that battle with many straight shafts. Diverse other kinds of illusion<br>were conjured up there by that Rakshasa. Conversant with all weapons, the<br>son of Phalguni however, neutralised them all. The Rakshasa then, his<br>illusions all destroyed, and himself struck with shafts, abandoned his<br>car even there, and fled away in great fear. After that Rakshasa addicted<br>to unfair fight had been thus vanquished, the son of Arjuna began to<br>grind thy troops in battle, like a juice-blind prince of wild elephants<br>agitating a lake overgrown with lotus.[465] Then Bhishma the son of<br>Santanu, beholding his troops routed, covered Subhadra's son with a thick<br>shower of arrows. Then many mighty car-warriors of the Dhartarashtra<br>army, standing in a ring round that single hero, began to strike him<br>forcibly with their shafts. That hero then, who resembled his sire in<br>prowess and who was equal to Vasudeva in valour and might,&#8212;that foremost<br>of all wielders of weapons,&#8212;achieved diverse feats in that battle that<br>were worthy of both his sire and maternal uncle. Then the heroic<br>Dhananjaya, excited with wrath and desirous of rescuing his son, arrived<br>at the spot where the latter was slaughtering thy troops as he came<br>along. And similarly, O king, thy sire Devavrata in that battle<br>approached Partha like Rahu approaching the sun.[466] Then thy sons, O<br>monarch, supported by cars, elephants, and steeds, surrounded Bhishma in<br>that battle and protected him from every side. And so also the Pandavas,<br>O king, clad in mail and surrounding Dhananjaya, engaged in fierce<br>battle, O bull of Bharata's race. Then Saradwat's son (Kripa), O king,<br>pierced Arjuna who was staying in front of Bhishma, with five and twenty<br>shafts. Thereupon, like a tiger attacking an elephant, Satyaki,<br>approaching Kripa, pierced him with many whetted shafts from desire of<br>doing what was agreeable to the Pandavas. Gautama in return, excited with<br>wrath, quickly pierced him of Madhu's race in the chest with nine arrows<br>winged with the feathers of the Kanka bird. Sini's grandson also, excited<br>with wrath, and forcibly drawing his bow, quickly sped at him an arrow<br>capable of taking his life. The fiery son of Drona, however, excited with<br>wrath, cut in twain that arrow as it coursed impetuously towards Kripa,<br>resembling Indra's bolt in effulgence. Thereupon that foremost of<br>car-warriors, viz., Sini's grandson, abandoning Gautama, rushed in battle<br>towards Drona's son like Rahu in the firmament against the Moon. Drona's<br>son, however, O Bharata, cut Satyaki's bow in twain. After his bow had<br>thus been cut off, the former began to strike the latter with his shafts.<br>Satyaki then, taking up another bow capable of bearing a great strain and<br>slaughtering the foe, struck Drona's son, O king, in the chest and arms<br>with six shafts. Pierced therewith and feeling great pain, for a moment<br>he was deprived of his senses, and he sat down on the terrace of his car,<br>catching hold of his flag-staff. Regaining his consciousness then, the<br>valiant son of Drona, excited with rage afflicted him of Vrishni's race<br>in that battle, with one long shaft. That shaft, piercing Sini's grandson<br>through, entered the earth like a vigorous young snake entering its hole<br>in the season of spring. And with another broad-headed arrow, Drona's son<br>in that battle cut off the excellent standard of Satyaki. And having<br>achieved this feat he uttered a leonine roar. And once more, O Bharata,<br>he covered his adversary with a shower of fierce shafts like the clouds,<br>O king covering the Sun after summer is past, Satyaki also, O monarch,<br>baffling that arrowy shower, soon covered the son of Drona with diverse<br>showers of arrows That slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the grandson of<br>Sini, freed from that arrowy shower like the Sun from the clouds, began<br>to scorch the son of Drona (with his energy). Swelling with rage the<br>mighty Satyaki once more covered his foe with a thousand arrows and<br>uttered a loud shout. Beholding his son then thus afflicted like the Moon<br>by Rahu, the valiant son of Bharadwaja rushed towards the grandson of<br>Sini. Desirous, O king, of rescuing, his son who was afflicted by the<br>Vrishni hero, Drona, in that great battle, pierced the latter with a<br>shaft of exceeding sharpness. Satyaki then, abandoning the mighty<br>car-warrior Aswatthaman, pierced Drona himself in that battle with twenty<br>arrows of exceeding sharpness. Soon after, that scorcher of foes and<br>mighty car-warrior, viz., Kunti's son of immeasurable soul, excited with<br>wrath, rushed in that battle against Drona. Then Drona and Partha<br>encountered each other in fierce combat like the planets Budha and Sukra,<br>O king, in the firmament.[467]
