                            Sanjaya said, "When the troops, O bull of Bharata's race, were withdrawn<br>on the first day, and when Duryodhana was filled with delight upon<br>(beholding) Bhishma excited with wrath in battle, king Yudhisthira the<br>just, speedily repaired unto Janardana, accompanied by all his brothers<br>and all the kings (on his side). Filled with great grief thinking of his<br>defeat, and beholding Bhishma's prowess, O king, he addressed that scion<br>of Vrishni's race, saying, 'Behold, O Krishna, that mighty bowman Bhishma<br>of terrible prowess. He consumes with his arrow my troops like fire<br>(consuming) dry grass. How shall we even look at that high-souled<br>(warrior) who is licking up my troops like fire fed with clarified<br>butter? Beholding; that tiger among men, that mighty warrior armed with<br>the bow, my troops fly away, afflicted with arrows. Enraged Yama himself,<br>or He armed with the thunder, or even Varuna noose in hand, or Kuvera<br>armed with mace, may be vanquished in battle but the mighty car-warrior<br>Bhishma, of great energy is incapable of being vanquished. Such being the<br>case, I am sinking in the fathomless ocean represented by Bhishma,<br>without a boat (to rescue me).[352] In consequence, O Kesava, of the<br>weakness of my understanding, having obtained Bhishma (for a foe in<br>battle), I shall, O Govinda, retire into woods. To live there is<br>preferable to devoting these lords of earth to Death in the form of<br>Bhishma. Conversant with mighty weapons, Bhishma, O Krishna, will<br>annihilate my army. As insects rush into the blazing fire for their own<br>destruction, the combatants of my army are even so. In putting forth<br>prowess for the sake of kingdom, O thou of Vrishni's race, I am being led<br>to destruction. My heroic brothers also are pained and afflicted with<br>arrows for my sake, having been deprived of both sovereignty and<br>happiness in consequence of their love for their eldest brother. We<br>regard life very highly, for, under these circumstances, life is too<br>precious (to be sacrificed). During the remainder of my days I will<br>practise the severest of ascetic austerities. I will not, O Kesava, cause<br>these friends of mine to be slain.[353] The mighty Bhishma incessantly<br>stays, with his celestial weapon, many thousands of my car-warriors who<br>are foremost of smiters. Tell me, O Madhava, without delay, what should<br>be done that might do me good. As regards Arjuna, I see that he is an<br>indifferent spectator in this battle. Endued with great might, this Bhima<br>alone, remembering Kshatriya duties, fighteth putting forth the prowess<br>of his arms and to the utmost of his power. With his hero-slaying mace,<br>this high-souled (warrior), to the full measure of his powers, achieveth<br>the most difficult feats upon foot-soldiers and steeds and cars and<br>elephants. This hero, however, is incapable, O sire, of destroying in<br>fair fight the hostile host in even a century. This thy friend (Arjuna)<br>alone (amongst) is conversant with (mighty) weapons. He, however,<br>beholding us consumed by Bhishma and the high-souled Drona, looketh<br>indifferently on us. The celestial weapons of Bhishma and the high-souled<br>Drona, incessantly applied, are consuming all the Kshatriyas. O Krishna,<br>such is his prowess, that Bhishma, with wrath excited, aided by the kings<br>(on his side), will, without doubt annihilate us. O Lord of Yoga, look<br>for that great bowman, that mighty car-warrior, who will give Bhishma his<br>quietus like rain-charged clouds quenching a forest conflagration. (Then)<br>through thy grace, O Govinda, the son of Pandu, their foes being slain,<br>will, after recovery of their kingdom, be happy with their kinsmen.<br><br>"Having said this, the high-souled son of Pritha, with heart afflicted by<br>grief and mind turned within, remained silent for a long while in a<br>reflected mood. Beholding the son of Pandu stricken with grief and<br>deprived of his senses by sorrow, Govinda then gladdening all the<br>Pandavas said, 'Do not grieve, O chief of the Bharatas. It behoveth thee<br>not to grieve, when thy brothers are all heroes and renowned bowmen in<br>the world. I also am employed in doing thee good, as also that mighty<br>car-warrior Satyaki and Virata and Drupada, both reverend in years, and<br>Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's line. And so also, O best of kings, all<br>these monarchs with their (respective) troops are expectant of thy favour<br>and devoted to thee, O king. This mighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna of<br>Prishata's race placed in command of thy army is always desirous of thy<br>welfare and engaged in doing that which is agreeable to thee, as also<br>this Sikhandin, O thou of mighty arms, who is certainly the slayer of<br>Bhishma. Hearing these words, the king (Yudhishthira), said, unto that<br>mighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna, in that very assembly and in the<br>hearing of Vasudeva, these words, O Dhrishtadyumna, mark these words that<br>I say unto thee, O thou of Prishata's line. The words uttered by me<br>should not be transgressed. Approved by Vasudeva, thou hast been the<br>commander of our forces. As Kartikeya, in days of old, was ever the<br>commander of the celestial host, so also art thou, O bull among men, the<br>commander of the Pandava host. Putting forth thy prowess, O tiger among<br>men, slay the Kauravas. I will follow thee, and Bhima, and Krishna also,<br>O sire, and the sons of Madri united together, and the sons of Draupadi<br>accoutred in mail, and all the other foremost of kings, O bull among men.<br>Then gladdening (the listeners) Dhrishtadyumna said, 'Ordained of old by<br>Sambhu himself, I am, O son of Pritha, the slayer of Drona. I shall now<br>fight in battle against Bhishma, and Drona and Kripa and Salya and<br>Jayadratha and all the proud monarchs (on the Kuru side)'. When that<br>foremost of princes, that slayer of foes, the son of Prishata, said this<br>defiantly, the Pandava warriors, endued with great energy and incapable<br>of being defeated in battle, all set up a loud shout. And then Pritha's<br>son Yudhishthira said unto the commander of his army, the son of<br>Prishata, (these words), 'An array known by the name of Krauncharuma,<br>that is destructive of all foes, and that was spoken of by Vrihaspati<br>unto Indra in days of old when the gods and the Asuras fought,&#8212;that<br>array destructive of hostile divisions, do thou form. Unseen before, the<br>kings behold it, along with the Kurus.' Thus addressed by that god among<br>men, like Vishnu addressed by the wielder of the thunderbolt,[354] he<br>(Dhrishtadyumna), when morning dawned, placed Dhananjaya in the van of<br>the whole army. And Dhananjaya's standard, created at Indra's command by<br>the celestial artificer, while moving through the skies, seemed<br>wonderfully beautiful. Decked with banners bearing hues resembling those<br>of Indra's bow,[355] coursing through the air like a ranger of the skies,<br>and looking like the fleeting edifice of vapour in the welkin, it seemed,<br>O sire to glide dancingly along the track of the car (to which it was<br>attached). And the bearer of Gandiva with that (standard) graced with<br>gems, and that standard itself with the bearer of Gandiva, looked highly<br>adorned, like the Self-create with the Sun (and the Sun with the<br>Self-create).[356] And king Drupada, surrounded by a large number of<br>troops, became the head (of that array). And the two kings Kuntibhoja and<br>Saivya became its two eyes. And the ruler of the Dasarnas, and the<br>Prayagas, with the Daserakas, and the Anupakas, and the Kiratas were<br>placed in its neck, O bull of Bharata's race. And Yudhishthira, O king,<br>with the Patachcharas, the Hunas, the Pauravakas and the Nishadas, became<br>its two wings, so also the Pisachas, with the Kundavishas, and the<br>Mandakas, the Ladakas, the Tanganas, and the Uddras, O Bharata, and the<br>Saravas, the Tumbhumas, the Vatsas, and the Nakulas. And Nakula and<br>Sahadeva placed themselves on the left wing. And on the joints of the<br>wings were placed ten thousand cars and on the head a hundred thousand,<br>and on the back a hundred millions and twenty thousand and on the neck a<br>hundred and seventy thousand. And on the joints of the wings, the wings<br>and the extremities of the wings proceeded elephants in large bodies,<br>looking, O king, like blazing mountains. And the rear was protected by<br>Virata aided by the Kekayas, and the ruler of Kasi and the king of the<br>Chedis, with thirty thousand cars.[357] Forming, O Bharata, their mighty<br>array thus, the Pandavas, expectant of sunrise, waited for battle, all<br>cased in armour. And their white umbrellas, clean and costly, and<br>brilliant as the sun, shone resplendent on their elephants and cars."[358]
