                            "Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;'Tell me truly (O Sanjaya) of this Varsha that is<br>called after Bharata, where this senseless force hath been collected, in<br>respect of which this my son Duryodhana hath been so very covetous, which<br>the sons of Pandu also are desirous of obtaining, and in which my mind<br>too sinketh. O, tell me this, for thou art, in my judgment endued with<br>intelligence.<br><br>"Sanjaya said,&#8212;'Listen to me, O king The sons of Pandu are not covetous<br>about this country. On the other hand, it is Duryodhana that is covetous,<br>and Sakuni the son of Suvala, as also many other Kshatriyas who are<br>rulers of the provinces, who being covetous of this country are not able<br>to bear one another. I will now will thee, O thou of Bharata's race, of<br>the tract of land known by Bharata's name. This land is the beloved one<br>of Indra, and, O thou of Bharata's race, this land, O monarch, that is<br>called after Bharata, is also the beloved land of Manu, the son of<br>Vivaswat, of Prithu, of Vainya, of the high-souled Ikshwaku, of Yayati,<br>of Amvarisha, of Mandhatri, of Nahusha, of Muchukunda, of Sivi the son of<br>Usinara, of Rishava, of Ila, of king Nriga, of Kusika, O invincible one,<br>of the high-souled Gadhi, of Somaka, O irrepressible one, and of Dilipa,<br>and also, O monarch, of many other mighty Kshatriyas. I will now, O<br>chastiser of foes, describe to thee that country as I have heard of it.<br>Listen to me, O king, as I speak of what thou hast asked me. Mahendra,<br>Malaya, Sahya, Suktimat, Rakshavat, Vindhya, and Paripatra,&#8212;these seven<br>are the Kala-mountains[58] (of Bharatvarsha). Besides these, O king,<br>there are thousands of mountains that are unknown, of hard make, huge,<br>and having excellent valleys. Besides these there are many other smaller<br>mountains inhabited by barbarous tribes. Aryans and Mlecchas, O Kauravya,<br>and many races, O lord, mixed of the two elements, drink the waters of<br>the following rivers, viz., magnificent Ganga, Sindhu, and Saraswati; of<br>Godavari, and Narmada, and the large river called Yamuna; of<br>Dhrishadwati, and Vipapa, and Vipasa and Sthulavaluka; of the river<br>Vetravati, and that other one called Krishna-vena; of Iravati, and<br>Vitasta, and Payosyini, and Devika; of Vedasmrita and Vedavati, and<br>Tridiva, and Ikshumalavi;[59] of Karishini, and Chitravaha, and the river<br>called Chitrasena; of Gomati, and Dhutapada and the large river called<br>Gandaki[60], of Kausiki, and Nischitra, and Kirtya, and Nichita, and<br>Lohatarini;[61] of Rashasi and Satakumbha, and also Sarayu; of<br>Charmanwati, and Vetravati,[62] and Hastisoma, and Disa; of the river<br>called Saravati, and Venna, and Bhimarathi; of Kaveri, and Chuluka, and<br>Vina, and Satavala; of Nivara, and Mahila, and Suprayoga, O king; of<br>Pavitra, and Kundala, and Rajani, and Puramalini; of Purvabhirama, and<br>Vira, and Bhima, and Oghavati; of Palasini, and Papahara, and Mahendra,<br>and Patalavati, of Karishini, and Asikni, and the large river Kusachira:<br>of Makari, and Pravara, and Mena, and Hema, and Dhritavati; of Puravati,<br>and Anushna, and Saivya, and Kapi, O Bharata; of Sadanira, and Adhrishya,<br>and the mighty stream Kusadhara; of Sadakanta, and Siva, and Viravati; of<br>Vatsu, and Suvastu, and Kampana with Hiranwati; of Vara, and the mighty<br>river Panchami, of Rathachitra, and Jyotiratha, and Viswamitra, and<br>Kapinjala; of Upendra, and Vahula, and Kuchira, and Madhuvahini: of<br>Vinadi, and Pinjala, and Vena, and the great river Pungavena; of Vidisa<br>and Krishna-vena, and Tamra, and Kapila, of Salu, and Suvama, the<br>Vedaswa, and the mighty river Harisrava; of Sighra, and Pischala, and the<br>river Bharadwaji, of the river Kausiki, and Sona, and Chandrama; of<br>Durgamantrasila, and Brahma-vodhya, and Vrihadvati; of Yaksha, and Rohi,<br>and Yamvunadi; of Sunasa and Tamasa, and Dasi, and Vasa, and Varuna, and<br>Asi; of Nila, and Dhrimati, and the mighty river Parnasa; of Pomasi, and<br>Vrishabha, and Brahma-meddhya, and Vrihaddhani. These and many other<br>large rivers, O king, such as Sadonirmaya and Krishna, and Mandaga, and<br>Mandavahini; and Mahagouri, and Durga, O Bharata; and Chitropala.<br>Chitraratha, and Manjula, and Vahini; and Mandakini, and Vaitarani, and<br>Kosa, and Mahanadi; and Suktimati, and Ananga, and Pushpaveni, and<br>Utpalavati; and Lohitya, Karatoya, and Vrishasabhya; and Kumari, and<br>Rishikullya and Marisha, and Saraswati; and Mandakini, and Supunya,<br>Sarvasanga, O Bharata, are all mothers of the universe and productive of<br>great merit. Besides these, there are rivers, by hundreds and thousands,<br>that are not known (by names), I have now recounted to thee, O king, all<br>the rivers as far as I remember.<br><br>"After this, listen to the names of the provinces as I mention them.

They<br>are the Dravidas, the Keralas, the Prachyas, the Mushikas, and the<br>Vanavashikas; the Karanatakas, the Mahishakas, the Vikalpas, and also the<br>Mushakas; the Jhillikas, the Kuntalas, the Saunridas, and the<br>Nalakananas; the Kankutakas, the Cholas, and the Malavayakas; the<br>Samangas, the Kanakas, the Kukkuras, and the Angara-marishas; the<br>Samangas, the Karakas, the Kukuras, the Angaras, the Marishas: the<br>Dhwajinis, the Utsavas, the Sanketas, the Trigartas, and the Salwasena;<br>the Vakas, the Kokarakas, the Pashtris, and the Lamavegavasas; the<br>Vindhyachulakas, the Pulindas, and the Valkalas; the Malavas, the<br>Vallavas, the further-Vallavas, the Kulindas, the Kalavas, the Kuntaukas,<br>and the Karatas; the Mrishakas, the Tanavalas, the Saniyas; the Alidas,<br>the Pasivatas, the Tanayas, and the Sulanyas; the Rishikas, the<br>Vidarbhas, the Kakas, the Tanganas, and the further-Tanganas.

These and other kingdoms are on<br>the east and on the north. O lord, alluding to them briefly I have told<br>thee all. Earth, if its resources are properly developed according to its<br>qualities and prowess, is like an ever-yielding[63] cow, from which the<br>three-fold fruits of virtue, profit and pleasure, may be milked. Brave<br>kings conversant with virtue and profit have become covetous of Earth.<br>Endued with activity, they would even cast away their lives in battle,<br>from hunger of wealth. Earth is certainly the refuge of creatures endued<br>with celestial bodies as also of creatures endued with human bodies.[64]<br>Desirous of enjoying Earth, the kings, O chief of the Bharatas, have<br>become like dogs that snatch meat from one another. Their ambition is<br>unbounded, knowing no gratification.[65] It is for this that the Kurus<br>and the Pandavas are striving for possession of Earth, by negotiation,<br>disunion, gift, and battle, O Bharata. If Earth be well looked after, it<br>becometh the father, mother, children, firmament and heaven, of all<br>creatures, O bull among men.'"
