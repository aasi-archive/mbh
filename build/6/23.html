                            Sanjaya said,&#8212;"Beholding the Dhartarashtra army approach for fight,<br>Krishna said these words for Arjuna's benefit."<br><br>"The holy one said,&#8212;'Cleansing thyself, O mighty-armed one, utter on the<br>eve of the battle thy hymn to Durga for (compassing) the defeat of the<br>foe."<br><br>Sanjaya continued.&#8212;Thus addressed on the eve of battle by Vasudeva<br>endued with great intelligence, Pritha's son Arjuna, alighting from his<br>car, said the following hymn with joined hands.<br><br>"Arjuna said,&#8212;'I bow to thee, O leader of Yogins, O thou that art<br>identical with Brahman, O thou that dwellest in the forest of Mandara, O<br>thou that art freed from decrepitude and decay, O Kali, O wife of Kapala,<br>O thou that art of a black and tawny hue, I bow to thee. O bringer of<br>benefits to thy devotees, I bow to thee, O Mahakali, O wife of the<br>universal destroyer, I bow to thee. O proud one, O thou that rescuest<br>from dangers, O thou that art endued with every auspicious attribute. O<br>thou that art sprung from the Kata race, O thou that deservest the most<br>regardful worship, O fierce one, O giver of victory, O victory's self, O<br>thou that bearest a banner of peacock plumes, O thou that art decked with<br>every ornament, O thou that bearest an awful spear, O thou that holdest a<br>sword and shield, O thou that art the younger sister of the chief of<br>cow-herds, O eldest one, O thou that wert born in the race of the cowherd<br>Nanda! O thou that art always fond of buffalo's blood, O thou that wert<br>born in the race of Kusika, O thou that art dressed in yellow robes, O<br>thou that hadst devoured Asuras assuming the face of a wolf[120], I bow<br>to thee that art fond of battle! O Uma,[121] Sakambhari, O thou that art<br>white in hue, O thou that art black in hue, O thou that hast slain the<br>Asura Kaitabha, O thou that art yellow-eyed, O thou that art<br>diverse-eyed, O thou of eyes that have the colour of smoke, I bow to<br>thee. O thou that art the Vedas, the Srutis, and the highest virtue, O<br>thou that art propitious to Brahmanas engaged in sacrifice, O thou that<br>hast a knowledge of the past, thou that art ever present in the sacred<br>abodes erected to thee in cities of Jamvudwipa, I bow to thee. Thou art<br>the science of Brahma among sciences, and thou that art that sleep of<br>creatures from which there is no waking. O mother of Skanda, O thou that<br>possessest the six (highest) attributes, O Durga, O thou that dwellest in<br>accessible regions, thou art described as Swaha, and Swadha,[122] as<br>Kala, as Kashta, and as Saraswati, as Savitra the mother of the Vedas,<br>and as the science of Vedanta. With inner soul cleansed, I praise thee. O<br>great goddess, let victory always attend me through thy grace on the<br>field of battle. In inaccessible regions, where there is fear, in places<br>of difficulty, in the abodes of thy worshippers and in the nether regions<br>(Patala), thou always dwellest. Thou always defeatest the Danavas. Thou<br>art the unconsciousness, the sleep, the illusion, the modesty, the beauty<br>of (all creatures). Thou art the twilight, thou art the day, thou art<br>Savitri, and thou art the mother. Thou art contentment, thou art growth,<br>thou art light. It is thou that supportest the Sun and the Moon and that<br>makes them shine. Thou art the prosperity of those that are prosperous.<br>The Siddhas and the Charanas behold thee in contemplation.[123]'"<br><br>Sanjaya continued,&#8212;Understanding (the measure of) Partha's devotion,<br>Durga who is always graciously inclined towards mankind, appeared in the<br>firmament and in the presence of Govinda, said these words.<br><br>'"The goddess said,&#8212;'Within a short time thou shalt conquer thy foes, O<br>Pandava. O invincible one, thou hast Narayana (again) for aiding thee.<br>Thou art incapable of being defeated by foes, even by the wielder of the<br>thunderbolt himself.'<br><br>'"Having said this, the boon-giving goddess disappeared soon. The son of<br>Kunti, however, obtaining that boon, regarded himself as successful, and<br>the son of Pritha then mounted his own excellent car. And then Krishna<br>and Arjuna, seated on the same car, blew their celestial conches. The man<br>that recites this hymn rising at dawn, hath no fear any time from<br>Yakshas, Rakshasas, and Pisachas. He can have no enemies; he hath no<br>fear, from snakes and all animals that have fangs and teeth, as also from<br>kings. He is sure to be victorious in all disputes, and if bound, he is<br>freed from his bonds. He is sure to get over all difficulties, is freed<br>from thieves, is ever victorious in battle and winneth the goddess of<br>prosperity for ever. With health and strength, he liveth for a hundred<br>years.<br><br>"I have known all this through the grace of Vyasa endued with great<br>wisdom. Thy wicked sons, however, all entangled in the meshes of death,<br>do not, from ignorance, know them to be Nara and Narayana. Nor do they,<br>entangled in the meshes of death, know that the hour of this kingdom hath<br>arrived. Dwaipayana and Narada, and Kanwa, and the sinless Rama, had all<br>prevented thy son. But he did not accept their words. There where<br>righteousness is, there are glory and beauty. There where modesty is,<br>there are prosperity and intelligence. There where righteousness is,<br>there is Krishna; and there where Krishna is, there is victory."
