                            Dhritarashtra said, "How did Sikhandin the prince of the Panchalas,<br>excited with wrath, rushed in battle against the grandsire, viz., Ganga's<br>son of righteous soul and regulated vows. What mighty car-warriors of the<br>Pandavas army, upraised weapons, desirous of victory, and exerting<br>themselves with activity, protected Sikhandin on that occasion which<br>required great activity? How also did Bhishma the son of Santanu, endued<br>with great energy, fight on that tenth day of battle with the Pandavas<br>and the Srinjayas? I cannot brook the idea of Sikhandin encountering<br>Bhishma in battle. (Indeed, when Sikhandin attacked Bhishma), was<br>Bhishma's car or his bow broken?"<br><br>Sanjaya said, "While fighting in that battle, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>neither the bow nor the car of Bhishma had suffered any injury. He was<br>then slaying the foe with straight shafts. Many thousands of mighty<br>car-warriors belonging to thy army, as also elephants, O king, and steeds<br>well harnessed, proceeded for battle, with the grandsire in the van.<br>Agreeably to his vow, O thou of Kuru's race, the ever-victorious Bhishma<br>was incessantly engaged in slaughtering the troops of the Parthas. The<br>Panchalas and the Pandavas were unable to bear that great bowman battling<br>(with them) and slaying his foes with his shafts. When the tenth day<br>came, the hostile army was torn into pieces by Bhishma with his shafts by<br>hundreds and thousands. O elder brother of Pandu, the sons of Pandu were<br>incapable of defeating in battle the great bowman Bhishma who resembled<br>the Destroyer himself armed with the lance.<br><br>"Then, O king, the unvanquished Vibhatsu or Dhananjaya, who was capable<br>of drawing the bow with even the left hand, came to that spot,<br>frightening all the car-warriors. Roaring loudly like a lion, and<br>repeatedly drawing the bow-string, and scattering showers of arrows,<br>Partha careered on the field of battle like Death himself. Frightened at<br>those roars of his, thy warriors, O bull of Bharata's race, fled away in<br>terror, like smaller animals, O king, at the sound of the lion. Beholding<br>the son of Pandu crowned with victory and thus afflicting that host,<br>Duryodhana, himself under the influence of terror addressed Bhishma and<br>said, 'You son of Pandu, O sire, with white steeds (yoked unto his car),<br>and having Krishna for his charioteer, consumeth all my troops like a<br>conflagration consuming a forest. Behold, O son of Ganga, all troops,<br>slaughtered by Pandu's son in battle, are, O foremost of warriors,<br>fleeing away. Indeed, as the herdsman belaboureth his cattle in the<br>forest, even so, O scorcher of foes is my army being belaboured. Broken<br>and driven away on all sides by Dhananjaya with his shafts, the<br>invincible Bhima is also routing that (already broken) host of mine. And<br>Satyaki, and Chekitana, and the twin sons of Madri, and the valiant<br>Abhimanyu,&#8212;these also are routing my troops. The brave Dhrishtadyumna,<br>and the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha also, are vigorously breaking and driving<br>away my army in this fierce conflict. Of these troops that are being<br>slaughtered by all those mighty car-warriors, I do not see any other<br>refuge in the matter of their staying and fighting on the field, O<br>Bharata, save thee, O tiger among men, that art possessed of prowess<br>equal to that of the celestials, Therefore, receive thou those great<br>car-warriors without delay, and be thou the refuge of these afflicted<br>troops. Thus addressed by him, O king, thy sire Devavrata, the son of<br>Santanu, reflecting for a moment and settling what he should do, said<br>these words unto thy son, comforting him (therewith), 'O Duryodhana,<br>listen calmly to what I say, O king, O thou of great might, formerly I<br>vowed before thee that slaying every day ten thousand high-souled<br>Kshatriyas, I would come back from the battle. I have fulfilled that vow,<br>O bull of Bharata's race! O thou of great might, today I will achieve<br>even a great feat. Today I will either sleep myself being slain, or, I<br>will slay the Pandavas. O tiger among men, I will today free myself from<br>the debt I owe thee,&#8212;the debt, O king, arising out of the food, thou<br>gavest me,&#8212;by casting away my life at the head of thy army.' Having said<br>these words, O chief of the Bharatas, that invincible warrior, scattering<br>his shafts among the Kshatriyas, attacked the Pandava host. And the<br>Pandavas then, O bull of Bharata's race, began to resist the son of Ganga<br>staying in the midst of his forces and excited with wrath like a snake of<br>virulent poison. Indeed, O king, on that tenth day of the battle,<br>Bhishma, displaying his might, slew, O son of Kuru's race, hundreds of<br>thousands. And he drained the energies of those royal and mighty<br>car-warriors that were the foremost among the Panchalas, like the Sun<br>sucking up the moisture (of the earth) with his rays. Having slain ten<br>thousand elephants of great activity and ten thousand steeds also, O<br>king, along with their riders, and full two hundred thousands of<br>foot-soldiers, that best of men, viz., Bhishma, shone resplendent in<br>battle like a fire without a curl of smoke. And no one amongst the<br>Pandavas was capable of even looking at him who then resembled the<br>burning Sun staying in the northern solstice. The Pandavas, however,<br>though afflicted in battle by that great bowman, still rushed,<br>accompanied by the mighty car-warriors of the Srinjayas, for slaughtering<br>him. Battling with myriads upon myriads around him, Santanu's son Bhishma<br>then looked like the cliff of Meru covered on all sides with masses of<br>clouds. Thy sons, however, stood, surrounding Bhishma on all sides with a<br>large force (for protecting him). Then commenced a fierce battle (between<br>the Kurus and the Pandavas)."
