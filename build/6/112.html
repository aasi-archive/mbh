                            Sanjaya said, "The mighty bowman (Alamvusha) the son of Rishyasringa, in<br>that battle, resisted Satyaki clad in mail and proceeding towards<br>Bhishma. He of Madhu's race, however, O king, excited with wrath, pierced<br>the Rakshasa with nine arrows, smiling the while, O Bharata. And so the<br>Rakshasa also, O king, excited with wrath, afflicted him of Madhu's race,<br>viz., that bull of Sini's line, with nine arrows. Then Sini's grandson,<br>that slayer of hostile heroes, of Madhu's race, excited with rage, sped<br>in that battle a profusion of arrows at the Rakshasa. Then that<br>mighty-aimed Rakshasa pierced Satyaki, of prowess incapable of being<br>baffled, with many sharp arrows, and uttered a loud shout. Then he of<br>Madhu's race, endued with great energy, though deeply pierced by the<br>Rakshasa in that battle, still, relying upon his prowess, laughed (at his<br>wounds) and uttered loud roars. Then Bhagadatta, excited with rage,<br>afflicted him of Madhu's race in that battle with many sharp arrows like<br>a guide piercing a huge elephant with the hook. Then that foremost of<br>car-warriors, viz., the grandson of Sini, abandoning the Rakshasa in<br>battle, sped many straight shafts at the ruler of the Pragjyotishas. The<br>ruler of the Pragjyotishas then, with a broad-headed arrow of great<br>sharpness, displaying great lightness of hand, cut off, the large bow of<br>Satyaki. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, excited with rage and taking<br>up another bow of greater impetus, pierced Bhagadatta in that battle with<br>many sharp arrows. That mighty bowman, viz., Bhagadatta, then deeply<br>pierced, began to lick the corners of his mouth. And he then hurled at<br>his foe, in that dreadful battle, a tough dart, made wholly of iron,<br>decked with gold and stones of lapis lazuli, and fierce as the rod of<br>Yama himself. Sped with the might of Bhagadatta's arm and coursing<br>towards him impetuously, Satyaki, O king, cut that dart in twain by means<br>of his shafts. Thereupon that dart fell down suddenly, like a great<br>meteor shorn of its splendour. Beholding the dart baffled, thy son<br>(Duryodhana), O monarch, surrounded him of Madhu's race with a large<br>number of cars. And seeing that mighty car-warrior among the Vrishnis<br>thus surrounded, Duryodhana, angrily addressing all his brothers, said,<br>'Take such steps, ye Kauravas, that Satyaki may not, in this battle,<br>escape you and this large division of cars, with life. If he be slain,<br>the vast host of the Pandavas may be regarded as slain also.' Accepting<br>Duryodhana's words with the answer&#8212;So be it,&#8212;those mighty car-warriors<br>fought with Sini's grandson in the view of Bhishma. The mighty ruler of<br>the Kamvojas, in that battle, resisted Abhimanyu who was proceeding<br>against Bhishma. The son of Arjuna, having pierced the king with many<br>straight shafts,[477] once more pierced that monarch, O monarch, with<br>four and sixty shafts. Sudakshina, however, desirous of Bhishma's life,<br>pierced Abhimanyu in that battle with five arrows and his charioteer with<br>nine. And the battle that took place there, in consequence of the meeting<br>of those two warriors, was fierce in the extreme. That grinder of foes<br>Sikhandin, then rushed at the of Ganga. Old Virata and Drupada, those<br>mighty car-warriors, both excited with rage, rushed to battle with<br>Bhishma, resisting the large host of the Kauravas as they went. That best<br>of car-warriors, viz., Aswatthaman, excited with rage, encountered both<br>those warriors. Then commenced a battle, O Bharata, between him and them.<br>Virata then, O chastiser of foes, struck, with broad-headed shafts, that<br>mighty bowman and ornament of battle, viz., Drona's son, as the latter<br>advanced against them. And Drupada also pierced him with three sharp<br>shafts. Then the preceptor's soil, Aswatthaman, coming upon those mighty<br>warriors thus striking him, viz., the brave Virata and Drupada both<br>proceeding towards Bhishma, pierced them both with many shafts. Wonderful<br>was the conduct that we then beheld of those two old warriors, inasmuch<br>as they checked all those fierce shafts shot by Drona's son. Like an<br>infuriate elephant in the forest rushing against an infuriate compeer,<br>Kripa, the son of Saradwat, proceeded against Sahadeva who was advancing<br>upon Bhishma. And Kripa, brave in battle, quickly struck that mighty<br>car-warrior, viz., the son of Madri, with seventy shafts decked with<br>gold. The son of Madri, however, cut Kripa's bow in twain by means of his<br>shafts. And cutting off his bow, Sahadeva then pierced Kripa with nine<br>arrows. Taking up then, in that battle, another bow capable of bearing a<br>great strain Kripa, excited with rage and desirous of Bhishma's life,<br>cheerfully struck Madri's son in that battle with ten shafts. And so the<br>son of Pandu, in return, desirous of Bhishma's death, excited with rage,<br>struck the wrathful Kripa in the chest (with many shafts). And then<br>occurred there a terrible and fierce battle. That scorcher of foes, viz.,<br>Vikarna, desirous of saving the grandsire Bhishma, excited with rage in<br>that battle, pierced Nakula with sixty arrows. Nakula also, deeply<br>pierced by thy intelligent son, pierced Vikarna in return with seven and<br>seventy shafts. There those two tigers among men, those two chastisers of<br>foes, those two heroes, struck each other for the sake of Bhishma, like<br>two bovine bulls in a fold. Thy son Durmukha, endued with great prowess,<br>proceeded, for the sake of Bhishma, against Ghatotkacha advancing to<br>battle and slaughtering thy army as he came. Hidimva's son, however, O<br>king, excited with rage, struck Durmukha, that chastiser of foes, in the<br>chest a straight shaft. The heroic Durmukha then, shouting cheerfully,<br>pierced Bhimasena's son on the field of battle with sixty shafts of keen<br>points. That mighty car-warrior, viz., the son of Hridika resisted<br>Dhrishtadyumna, that foremost of car-warriors, who was advancing to<br>battle from desire of Bhishma's slaughter. The son of Prishata, however,<br>having pierced Kritavarman with five shafts made wholly of iron, once<br>more, struck him quickly in the centre of the chest fifty shafts. And<br>similarly, O king, Prishata's son struck Kritavarman with nine sharp and<br>blazing shaft, winged with the feathers of the Kanka bird. Encountering<br>each other with great vigour, the battle that took place between them for<br>Bhishma's sake was as fierce as that between Vritra and Vasava. Against<br>Bhimasena who was advancing upon the mighty Bhishma, proceeded<br>Bhurisravas with great speed, saying,&#8212;Wait, Wait,&#8212;And the son of<br>Somadatta struck Bhima in the centre of the chest with an arrow of<br>exceeding sharpness and golden wings in that battle. And the valiant<br>Bhimasena, with that arrow on his chest, looked beautiful, O best of<br>kings, like the Krauncha mountain in days of old with the dart of Skanda.<br>And those two bulls among men, enraged in battle, shot at each other<br>shafts brightly polished by their forgers and endued with effulgence of<br>the Sun. Bhima, longing for Bhishma's death, fought with the mighty son<br>of Somadatta, and the latter, desirous of Bhishma's victory, fought with<br>the former, each carefully seeking to counteract the other's feats.<br>Bharadwaja's son resisted Yudhishthira the son of Kunti, who, accompanied<br>by a large force, was coming towards Bhishma. Hearing the rattle of<br>Drona's car, O king, that resembled the roar of the clouds, the<br>Prabhadrakas, O sire, began to tremble. That large force, of Pandu's son,<br>resisted by Drona in battle, could not, exerting vigorously, advance even<br>one step. Thy son Chitrasena, O king, resisted Chekitana of wrathful<br>visage who was exerting vigorously for coming upon Bhishma. Possessed of<br>great prowess and great dexterity of hand, that mighty car-warrior for<br>the sake of Bhishma, battled with Chekitana, O Bharata, according to the<br>utmost of his power. And Chekitana also fought with Chitrasena to the<br>utmost of his power. And the battle that took place there in consequence<br>of the meeting of those two warriors, was exceedingly fierce. As regards<br>Arjuna, although he was resisted by all means, O Bharata, he still<br>compelled thy son to turn back and then crushed thy troops. Dussasana<br>however, to the utmost stretch of his power, began to resist Partha,<br>wishing, O Bharata, to protect Bhishma. The army of thy son, O Bharata,<br>undergoing such slaughter, began to be agitated here and there by many<br>foremost car-warriors (of the Pandava)."
