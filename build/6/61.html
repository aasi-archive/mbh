                            Sanjaya said, "And Drona's son, and Bhurisravas, and Chitrasena, O sire,<br>and the son of Samyamani also, all fought with Subhadra's son. And while<br>fighting alone with five tigers among men, people beheld him possessed of<br>exceeding energy, like a young lion fighting with five elephants. And no<br>one among them equalled Krishna's son in sureness of aim, in bravery, in<br>prowess, in lightness of hand or in knowledge of weapons. And beholding<br>his son, that chastiser of foes thus struggling and displaying his<br>prowess in battle, Partha set up a leonine roar. And seeing thy grandson,<br>O king, thus afflicting thy host, thy warriors, O monarch, surrounded him<br>on all sides. Then that smiter of foes, the son of Subhadra, depending<br>upon his prowess and might, advanced with undepressed heart against the<br>Dhartarashtra host. And while battling with the foe in that conflict, his<br>mighty bow endued with the effulgence of the sun, was seen by all to be<br>incessantly stretched for striking. And piercing the son of Drona with<br>one shaft, and Salya with five, he overthrew the standard of Samyamani's<br>son with eight shafts. And with another sharp-edged arrow he cut off the<br>mighty dart of golden staff, resembling a snake, that was hurled at him<br>by Somadatta's son. And the heir of Arjuna, baffling in the very sight of<br>Salya, his hundreds of terrible shafts, slew his four steeds. Thereupon<br>Bhurisravas, and Salya, and Drona's son and Samyamani, and Sala struck<br>with the fear at the strength of arms displayed by Krishna's son could<br>not stay before him. Then, O great king, the Trigartas and the Madras,<br>with the Kekayas, numbering five and twenty thousand urged by thy son,<br>all of whom were foremost of men accomplished in the science of arms and<br>who were incapable of defeat by foes in battle, surrounded Kiritin with<br>his son for slaying them both. Then, O king, that vanquisher of foes, the<br>commander of the Pandava army, the prince of the Panchalas, beheld the<br>cars of the father and the son (thus) surrounded (by the foe). Supported<br>by many thousands of elephants and cars, and by hundred thousands of<br>cavalry and infantry, and stretching his bow in great wrath he advanced<br>against that division of the Madras and the Kekayas, O chastiser of foes,<br>leading his troops with him. And that division (of the Pandava army),<br>protected by that renowned and firm bowman, and consisting of cars,<br>elephants, and cavalry, looked resplendent as it advanced for the<br>encounter. And while proceeding towards Arjuna, that perpetuator of<br>Panchala's race struck Saradwat's son on his shoulder-joint with three<br>arrows. And piercing the Madrakas then with ten sharp shafts, he speedily<br>slew the protector of Kritavarman's rear. And that chastiser of foes<br>then, with a shaft of broad head, slew Damana, the heir of the<br>high-souled Paurava. Then the son of Samyamani pierced the Panchala<br>prince incapable of defeat in the battle with ten shafts, and his<br>charioteer also with ten shafts. Then that mighty bowman, (thus) severely<br>pierced, licked with his tongue the corners of his mouth, and cut off his<br>enemy's bow with a broad-headed shaft of excessive sharpness. And soon<br>the prince of Panchala afflicted his foe with five and twenty arrows, and<br>then slew his steeds, O king, and then both the protectors of his wings.<br>Then, O bull of Bharata's race, Samyamani's son, standing on that car<br>whose steeds were slain, looked at the son of the renowned king of the<br>Panchalas. Then taking up a terrible scimitar of the best kind, made of<br>steel, Samyamani's son walking on foot, approached Drupada's son staying<br>on his car. And the Pandavas, soldiers and Dhrishtadyumna also of<br>Prishata's race beheld him coming like a wave and resembling a snake<br>fallen from the skies. And he whirled his sword and looked like the sun<br>and advanced with the tread of an infuriate elephant. The prince of<br>Panchala then, excited with rage, quickly taking up a mace, smashed the<br>head of Samyamani's son thus advancing towards him, sharp-edged scimitar<br>in grasp and shield in hand, as soon as the latter, having crossed the<br>shooting distance, was near enough to his adversary's car. And then, O<br>king, while falling down deprived of life, his blazing scimitar and<br>shield, loosened from his grasp, fell down with his body on the ground.<br>And the high-souled son of the Panchala king, of terrible prowess, having<br>slain his foe with his mace, won great renown. And when that prince, that<br>mighty car-warrior and great bowman, was (thus) slain, loud cries of oh<br>and alas arose among thy troops, O sire. Then Samyamani, excited with<br>rage upon beholding his own son slain, impetuously rushed towards the<br>prince of Panchala who was incapable of defeat in battle. And all the<br>kings of both the Kuru and the Pandava armies beheld those two princes<br>and foremost of car-warriors engaged in battle. Then that slayer of<br>hostile heroes Samyamani, excited with wrath, struck Prishata's son with<br>three shafts like (the conductor of an elephant striking) a mighty<br>elephant with hooks. And so Salya also, that ornament of assemblies,<br>excited with wrath, struck the heroic son of Prishata on his breast. And<br>then commenced (another) battle (there)."
