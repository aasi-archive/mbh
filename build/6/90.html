                            Dhritarashtra said, "Beholding my sons, so many in number, O Sanjaya,<br>slain by a single person, what did Bhishma and Drona and Kripa do in<br>battle?[432] Day after day, O Sanjaya, my sons are being slain. I think,<br>O Suta, that they are completely overtaken by evil destiny, inasmuch as<br>my sons never conquer but are always vanquished. When my sons staying in<br>the midst of those unretreating heroes, viz., Drona and Bhishma, and the<br>high-souled Kripa, and Somadatta's heroic son and Bhagadatta, and<br>Aswatthaman also, O son, and other brave warriors, are being still slain<br>in battle, what can it be said save the result of fate?[433] The wicked<br>Duryodhana did not comprehend (our) words before, though admonished by<br>me, O son, and by Bhishma and Vidura. (Though forbidden) always by<br>Gandhari, too, from motives of doing him good, Duryodhana of wicked<br>understanding awoke not before from folly.[434] That (conduct) hath now<br>borne fruit, inasmuch as Bhimasena, excited with wrath, despatcheth, day<br>after day in battle, my insensate sons to the abode of Yama."<br><br>Sanjaya said, "Those excellent words of Vidura, uttered for thy good, but<br>which thou didst not then understand, have now come to be realised.<br>Vidura had said, 'Restrain thy sons from the dice.' Like a man whose hour<br>is come refusing the proper medicine, thou didst not then listen to the<br>words of well-wishing friends counselling thee (for thy good). Those<br>words uttered by the righteous have now been realised before thee.<br>Indeed, the Kauravas are now being destroyed for having rejected those<br>words, deserving of acceptance, of Vidura and Drona and Bhishma and thy<br>other well-wishers. These very consequences happened even then when thou<br>declinedst to listen to those counsels. Hear now, however, to my<br>narration of the battle exactly as it has happened.[435] At midday the<br>battle became exceedingly awful and fraught with great carnage. Listen to<br>me, O king, as I describe it. Then all the troops (of the Pandava army),<br>excited with rage, rushed, at the command of Dharma's son, against<br>Bhishma alone from desire of slaying him. Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin,<br>and the mighty car-warrior Satyaki, accompanied, O king, by their forces,<br>proceeded against Bhishma alone. And those mighty car-warriors, viz.,<br>Virata and Drupada, with all the Somakas, rushed in battle against<br>Bhishma alone. And the Kaikeyas, and Dhrishtaketu, and Kuntibhoja,<br>equipped in mail and supported by their forces, rushed, O king, against<br>Bhishma alone. And Arjuna, and the sons of Draupadi, and Chekitana of<br>great prowess, proceeded against all the kings under the command of<br>Duryodhana. And the heroic Abhimanyu, and that mighty car-warrior, viz.,<br>the son of Hidimva, and Bhimasena excited with wrath, rushed against the<br>(other) Kauravas. (Thus) the Pandavas, divided into three bodies began to<br>slaughter the Kauravas. And similarly the Kauravas also, O king, began to<br>slaughter their foes.[436] That foremost of car-warriors, viz., Drona<br>excited with wrath, rushed against the Somakas and the Srinjayas,<br>desirous of sending them to the abode of Yama. Thereupon loud cries of<br>woe arose among the brave Srinjayas while they were being slaughtered. O<br>king, by Bharadwaja's son bow in hand. Large numbers of Kshatriyas,<br>struck down by Drona, were seen to all convulsing like persons writhing<br>in the agony of disease. All over the field were continuously heard moans<br>and shrieks and groans resembling those of persons afflicted with hunger.<br>And so the mighty Bhimasena, excited with wrath, and like unto a second<br>Yama, caused a terrible carnage amongst the Kaurava troops. There in that<br>dreadful battle, in consequence of the warriors slaying one another, a<br>terrible river began to flow whose billowy current consisted of<br>blood.[437] And that battle, O king, between the Kurus and the Pandavas,<br>becoming fierce and awful, began to swell the population of Yama's<br>kingdom. Then in that battle Bhima excited with wrath, fell with great<br>impetuosity upon the elephant division (of the Kauravas) and began to<br>send many to the regions of Death. Then, O Bharata, struck with Bhima's<br>shafts, some of those beasts fell down, some were paralysed, some<br>shrieked (in pain), and some ran away in all directions. Huge elephants,<br>their trunks cut off and limbs mangled, screaming like cranes, began, O<br>king, to fall down on the earth. Nakula and Sahadeva fell upon the<br>(Kaurava) cavalry. Many steeds with garlands of gold on their heads and<br>with their necks and breasts adorned with ornaments of gold, were seen to<br>be slain in hundreds and thousands. The earth, O king, was strewn with<br>fallen steeds. And some were deprived of their tongues; and some breathed<br>hard; and some uttered low moans, and some were void of life. The earth<br>looked beautiful, O chief of men, with those steeds of such diverse<br>kinds. At the same time, O Bharata, she looked fiercely resplendent, O<br>monarch, with a large number of kings slain by Arjuna in that battle. And<br>strewn with broken cars and rent banners and brilliant umbrellas, with<br>torn chamaras and fans, and mighty weapons broken into fragments, with<br>garlands and necklaces of gold, with bracelets, with heads decked with<br>ear-rings, with head-gears loosened (from off heads), with standards,<br>with beautiful bottoms of cars, O king, and with traces and reins, the<br>earth shone as brightly as she does in spring when strewn with flowers.<br>And it was thus, O Bharata, that the Pandava host suffered destruction<br>when Bhishma the son of Santanu, and Drona that foremost of car-warriors,<br>and Aswatthaman, and Kripa, and Kritavarman, were inflamed with wrath.<br>And similarly thy army also suffered the same kind of destruction when<br>the other side, viz., the Pandava heroes were excited with rage."
