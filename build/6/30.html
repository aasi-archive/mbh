                            [(Bhagavad Gita Chapter VI)]<br><br>"The Holy One said,&#8212;'Regardless of fruit of action, he that performs the<br>actions which should be performed, is a renouncer and devotee, and not<br>one who discards the (sacrificial) fire, nor one that abstains from<br>action.[191] That which has been called renunciation, know that, O son of<br>Pandu, to be devotion, since nobody can be a devotee who has not<br>renounced (all) resolves.[192] To the sage desirous of rising to<br>devotion, action is said to be the means; and when he has risen to<br>devotion, cessation of action is said to be the means. When one is no<br>longer attached to the objects of the senses, nor to actions, and when<br>one renounces all resolves, then is. One said to have risen to devotion.<br>One should raise (his ) self by self; one should not degrade (his) self;<br>for one's own self is one's friend, and one's own self is one's<br>enemy.[193] To him (only) who has subjugated his self by his self is self<br>a friend. But to him who has not subjugated his self, his self behaves<br>inimically like an enemy. The soul of one who has subjugated his self and<br>who is in the enjoyment of tranquillity, is steadily fixed (on itself)<br>amid cold and heat, pleasure and pain, and also honour and dishonour.<br>That ascetic is said to be devoted whose mind is satisfied with knowledge<br>and experience, who hath no affection, who hath subjugated his senses,<br>and to whom a sod, a stone and gold are alike. He, who views equally<br>well-wishers, friends, foes, strangers that are indifferent to him, those<br>who take part with both sides, those who are objects of aversion, those<br>who are related (to him), those who are good, and those who are wicked,<br>is distinguished (above all others). A devotee should always fix his mind<br>on contemplation, remaining in a secluded place alone, restraining both<br>mind and body, without expectations (of any kind), and without concern<br>(with anything).[194] Erecting his seat immovably on a clean spot, not<br>too high nor too low, and spreading over it a piece of cloth, a<br>deer-skin, or blades of Kusa grass, and there seated on that seat, with<br>mind fixed on one object, and restraining the functions of the heart and<br>the senses, one should practise contemplation for the purification of<br>self. Holding body, head, and neck even, unmoved and steady, and casting<br>his glance on the tip of his nose, and without looking about in any of<br>the different directions, with mind in tranquillity, freed from fear,<br>observant of the practices of Brahmacharins, restraining the mind, with<br>heart fixed on me, the devotee should sit down, regarding me as the<br>object of his attainment. Thus applying his soul constantly, the devotee<br>whose heart is restrained, attains to that tranquillity which culminates<br>in final absorption and assimilation with me. Devotion is not one's, O<br>Arjuna, who eateth much, nor one's who doth not eat at all; nor one's who<br>is addicted to too much sleep, nor one's who is always awake, devotion<br>that is destructive of misery is his who is temperate in food and<br>amusements, who duly exerts himself temperately in all his works, and who<br>is temperate in sleep and vigils. When one's heart, properly restrained,<br>is fixed on one's own self, then, indifferent to all objects of desire,<br>he is one called a devotee.[195] As a lamp in a windless spot doth not<br>flicker, even that is the resemblance declared of a devotee whose heart<br>hath been restrained and who applieth his self to abstraction. That<br>(condition) in which the mind, restrained by practice of abstraction,<br>taketh rest, in which beholding self by self, one is gratified within<br>self; in which one experienceth that highest felicity which is beyond the<br>(sphere of the) senses and which the understanding (only) can grasp, and<br>fixed on which one never swerveth from the truth; acquiring which one<br>regards no other acquisition greater than it, and abiding in which one is<br>never moved by even the heaviest sorrow; that (Condition) should be known<br>to be what is called devotion in which there is a severance of connection<br>with pain. That devotion should be practised with perseverance and with<br>an undesponding heart.[196] Renouncing all desires without exception that<br>are born of resolves, restraining the group of the senses on all sides by<br>mind alone, one should, by slow degrees, become quiescent (aided) by<br>(his) understanding controlled by patience, and then directing his mind<br>to self should think of nothing.[197] Wheresoever the mind, which is (by<br>nature) restless and unsteady, may run, restraining it from those, one<br>should direct it to self alone. Indeed, unto such a devotee whose mind is<br>in tranquillity, whose passions have been suppressed, who hath become one<br>with Brahma and who is free from sin, the highest felicity cometh (of his<br>own accord). Thus applying his soul constantly (to abstraction), the<br>devotee, freed from sin, easily obtaineth that highest happiness, viz.,<br>with Brahma. He who hath devoted his self to abstraction casting an equal<br>eye everywhere, beholdeth his self in all creatures and all creatures in<br>his self. Unto him who beholdeth me in everything and beholdeth<br>everything in me. I am never lost and he also is never lost to me.[198]<br>He who worshippeth me as abiding in all creatures, holding yet that all<br>is one, is a devotee, and whatever mode of life he may lead, he liveth in<br>me. That devotee, O Arjuna, who casteth an equal eye everywhere,<br>regarding all things as his own self and the happiness and misery of<br>others as his own, is deemed to be the best.'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'This devotion by means of equanimity which thou hast<br>declared, O slayer of Madhu,&#8212;on account of restlessness of the mind I do<br>not see its stable presence.[199] O Krishna, the mind is restless,<br>boisterous, perverse, and obstinate. Its restraint I regard to be as<br>difficult of accomplishment as the restraint of the wind.'<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'Without doubt, O thou of mighty arms the mind is<br>difficult of subjugation and is restless. With practice, however, O son<br>of Kunti, and with the abandonment of desire, it can be controlled. It is<br>my belief that by him whose mind is not restrained, devotion is difficult<br>of acquisition. But by one whose mind is restrained and who is assiduous,<br>it is capable of acquisition with the aid of means.'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'Without assiduity, though endued with faith, and with mind<br>shaken off from devotion, what is the end of him, O Krishna, who hath not<br>earned success in devotion? Fallen off from both,[200] is he lost like a<br>separated cloud or not, being as he is without refuge, O thou of mighty<br>arms, and deluded on the path leading to Brahma? This my doubt, O<br>Krishna, it behoveth thee to remove without leaving anything. Besides<br>thee, no dispeller of this doubt is to be had.[201]<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'O son of Pritha, neither here, nor hereafter, doth<br>ruin exist for him, since none, O sire, who performs good (acts) comes by<br>an evil end. Attaining to the regions reserved for those that perform<br>meritorious acts and living there for many many years, he that hath<br>fallen off from devotion taketh birth in the abode of those that art<br>pious and endued with prosperity, or, he is born even in the family of<br>devotees endued with intelligence. Indeed, a birth such as this is more<br>difficult of acquisition in this world. There in those births he<br>obtaineth contact with that Brahmic knowledge which was his in his former<br>life; and from that point he striveth again, O descendant of Kuru,<br>towards perfection. And although unwilling, he still worketh on in<br>consequence of that same former practice of his. Even one that enquireth<br>of devotion riseth above (the fruits of) the Divine Word.-[202] Striving<br>with great efforts, the devotee, cleaned of all his sins, attaineth to<br>perfection after many births, and then reacheth the supreme goal. The<br>devotee is superior to ascetics engaged in austerities; he is esteemed to<br>be superior to even the man of knowledge. The devotee is superior to<br>those that are engaged in action. Therefore, become a devotee, O Arjuna.<br>Even amongst all the devotees, he who, full of faith and with inner self<br>resting on me, worshippeth me, is regarded by me to be the most devout."
