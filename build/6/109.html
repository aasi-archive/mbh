                            Dhritarashtra said, "How did Sikhandin advance against the son of Ganga<br>in battle, and how did Bhishma also advance against the Pandavas? Say all<br>this unto me, O Sanjaya!"<br><br>Sanjaya said, "Then all those Pandavas, towards the hour of sun-rise,<br>with beat of drums and cymbals and smaller drums, and with the blare of<br>conches of milky whiteness, all around, went out for battle, placing<br>Sikhandin in their van. And they marched out, O king, having formed an<br>array that was destructive of all foes. And Sikhandin, O monarch, was<br>stationed in the very van of all the troops. And Bhimasena and Dhananjaya<br>became the protectors of his car-wheels. And in his rear were the sons of<br>Draupadi and the valiant Abhimanyu. And those mighty car-warriors, viz.,<br>Satyaki and Chekitana, became the protectors of the last. And behind them<br>was Dhrishtadyumna protected by the Panchalas. Next to Dhrishtadyumna,<br>behind, marched the royal lord Yudhishthira, accompanied by the twins,<br>filling the air with leonine shouts, O bull of Bharata's race. Next<br>behind him was Virata, surrounded by his own troops. Next to him marched<br>Drupada, O mighty-armed one. And the five Kaikeya brothers and the<br>valiant Dhrishtaketu, O Bharata, protected the rear of the Pandava army.<br>Having disposed their vast army in such an array, the Pandavas rushed<br>against thy host, prepared to cast away their lives. And similarly the<br>Kauravas, O king, placing that mighty car-warrior Bhishma at the head of<br>their whole host, proceeded against the Pandavas. And that invincible<br>warrior was protected by thy mighty sons. Next behind them was the great<br>bowman Drona, as also his mighty son (Aswatthaman). Next behind was<br>Bhagadatta surrounded by his elephant division. And behind Bhagadatta<br>were Kripa and Kritavarman. Behind them were Sudakshina the mighty ruler<br>of the Kamvojas, and Jayatsena, the king of the Magadhas, and Suvala's<br>son and Vrihadvala. And similarly, many other kings, that were all great<br>bowmen, protected the rear of thy host, O Bharata. As each day came,<br>Bhishma the son of Santanu, formed arrays in battle, sometimes after the<br>manner of the Asuras, sometimes after that of the Pisachas, and sometimes<br>after that of the Rakshasas. Then commenced the battle between thy<br>troops, O Bharata, and theirs, both parties smiting one another and<br>increasing the population of Yama's kingdom. And the Parthas with Arjuna<br>at their head, placing Sikhandin in the van, proceeded against Bhishma in<br>that battle, scattering diverse kinds of arrows. And then, O Bharata<br>afflicted by Bhishma with his shafts, (many of) thy warriors, profusely<br>bathed in blood, repaired to the other world. And Nakula and Sahadeva,<br>and the mighty car-warrior Satyaki, approaching thy army, began to<br>afflict it with great vigour. Thus slaughtered in battle, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, thy warriors were unable to resist that vast host of the<br>Pandavas. Then thy host, vigorously afflicted by great car-warriors and<br>thus slaughtered by them everywhere, fled away on all sides. Slaughtered<br>with sharp shafts by the Pandavas and the Srinjayas they found not a<br>protector, O bull of Bharata's race."<br><br>Dhritarashtra said, "Tell me, O Sanjaya, what the valiant Bhishma,<br>excited with rage, did in battle, upon beholding my host afflicted by the<br>Parthas. O sinless one, tell me how that hero, that chastiser of foes,<br>rushed against the Pandavas in battle, and slaughtered the Somakas."<br><br>Sanjaya said, "I will tell thee, O king, what thy sire did when thy sons'<br>host was afflicted by the Pandavas and the Srinjayas. With cheerful<br>hearts, the brave sons of Pandu, O elder brother of Pandu, encountered<br>thy son's host, slaughtering (all whom they met). That carnage, O chief<br>of men, of human beings, elephants and steeds, that destruction by the<br>foe of thy army in battle, Bhishma could not brook. That invincible and<br>great bowman, then, reckless of his very life poured upon the Pandavas,<br>the Panchalas, and the Srinjayas, showers of long shafts and calf-toothed<br>and crescent-shaped arrows. And with weapons, O monarch, he checked with<br>his shafts and with showers of other weapons, both offensive and<br>defensive, all sped with energy and wrath, the five foremost of mighty<br>car-warriors of the Pandavas, who had been struggling vigorously in<br>battle. Excited with wrath, he slaughtered in that battle countless<br>elephants and steeds. And that bull among men, O monarch, throwing down<br>many car-warriors from their cars,[473] and horsemen from their horses,<br>and crowds of foot soldiers, and elephant-warriors from the backs of the<br>beasts they rode, struck terror into the foe. And the Pandava warriors<br>all rushed together upon Bhishma singly, upon that mighty car-warrior<br>struggling in battle with great activity, like the Asuras rushing<br>together upon him with the thunderbolt in hand. Shooting on all sides his<br>whetted arrows whose touch resembled that of Indra's thunder, he seemed<br>to the enemy to have assembled a terrible visage. While fighting in that<br>battle, his large bow, resembling that of Sakra himself, seemed to be<br>always drawn to a circle. Beholding those feats in battle, thy sons, O<br>monarch, filled with exceeding wonder, worshipped the grandsire. The<br>Parthas cast their eyes, with cheerless hearts, upon thy heroic sire<br>struggling in battle, like the celestials upon (the Asura) Viprachitti<br>(in days of old).[474] They could not resist that warrior who then<br>resembled the Destroyer himself with wide-open mouth. In that battle on<br>the tenth day, Bhishma, with his sharp shafts, consumed the division of<br>Sikhandin like a conflagration consuming a forest. Him resembling an<br>angry snake of virulent poison, or the Destroyer urged by Death himself,<br>Sikhandin pierced with three shafts in the centre of the chest. Deeply<br>pierced therewith, Bhishma saw that it was Sikhandin (who was piercing<br>him). Excited with wrath, but unwilling (to fight with Sikhandin) Bhishma<br>laughingly said, 'Whether thou choosest to strike me or not, I will never<br>fight with thee. Thou art that Sikhandin still which the Creator had made<br>thee first',[475] Hearing these words of his, Sikhandin, deprived of his<br>senses by wrath, and licking the corners of his mouth addressed Bhishma<br>in that battle, saying, 'I know thee, O mighty-armed one, to be the<br>exterminator of the Kshatriya race. I have heard also of thy battle with<br>Jamadagni's son. I have also heard much of thy super-human prowess.<br>Knowing thy prowess I will still fight with thee today. For doing what is<br>agreeable to the Pandavas and is agreeable to my own self, O chastiser of<br>foes, I will today fight with thee in battle, O best of men. I will, of a<br>certainty, slay thee. I swear this before thee by my troth! Hearing these<br>words of mine, do that which thou shouldst. Whether thou choosest to<br>strike me or not, thou shall not escape me with life. O thou that art<br>ever victorious, O Bhishma, look thy last on this world.<br><br>Sanjaya continued, "Having said so, Sikhandin in that battle pierced<br>Bhishma with five straight shafts, having already pierced him with his<br>wordy shafts. Hearing those words of his, the mighty car-warrior Arjuna,<br>regarding Sikhandin to be Bhishma's Destroyer, urged him on, saying, 'I<br>will fight behind thee, routing the foe with my shafts. Excited with<br>fury, rush thou against Bhishma of terrible prowess. The mighty Bhishma<br>will not be able to afflict thee in battle. Therefore, O mighty-armed<br>one, encounter Bhishma with vigor. If, O sire, thou returnest today<br>without slaying Bhishma, thou wilt, with myself, be an object of ridicule<br>to the world. Seek to do that in battle by which, O hero, we may not<br>incur ridicule in this great battle. Stay the grandsire. O thou of great<br>strength, I will protect thee in this battle, checking all the<br>car-warriors (of the Kuru army). Do thou slay the grandsire. Drona, and<br>Drona's son, and Kripa, and Suyodhana, and Chitrasena, and Vikarna, and<br>Jayadratha the ruler of the Sindhus, Vinda and Anuvinda. of Avanti, and<br>Sudakshina the ruler of the Kamvojas, and the brave Bhagadatta, and the<br>mighty king of the Magadhas, and Somadatta's son, and the brave Rakshasas<br>who is Rishyasringa's son and the ruler of the Trigartas, alone with all<br>the other great car-warriors (of the Kuru army). I will check like the<br>continent resisting the surging sea. Indeed, I will hold in check all the<br>mighty warriors of the Kuru army assembled together and battling with us.<br>Do thou slay the grandsire.'
