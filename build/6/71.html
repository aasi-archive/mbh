                            Sanjaya said, "Beholding his brothers and the other kings engaged in<br>battle with Bhishma, Dhananjaya, with weapons upraised, rushed against<br>the son of Ganga. Hearing the blare of Panchajanya and the twang of the<br>bow Gandiva, and seeing also the standard of Pritha's son, a great fear<br>entered our hearts. And the standard that we behold, O king, of the<br>wielder of Gandiva bore the device of lion's tail and looked like a<br>blazing mountain in the welkin. Beautiful and of celestial workmanship,<br>it was variegated with diverse hues, and looking like a risen comet it<br>could not be obstructed by trees. And in that great battle, the warriors<br>beheld Gandiva, the back of whose staff was decked with pure gold, and<br>which looked beautiful like a flash of lightning in the midst of a mass<br>of clouds in the firmament. And while slaying the combatants of thy army,<br>the shouts we heard uttered by Arjuna seemed to resemble the loud roars<br>of Indra himself, and the slaps also of his palms were frightfully loud.<br>Like a roaring mass of clouds charged with lightning and aided by a<br>raging tempest, Arjuna incessantly poured his arrowy showers on all<br>sides, completely shrouding the ten points of the compass. Dhananjaya<br>then possessed of terrible weapons, quickly proceeded towards the son of<br>Ganga. Deprived of four senses in consequence of his weapons, we could<br>not then distinguish the East from the West. And thy warriors, then, O<br>bull of Bharata's race,&#8212;their animals tired, steeds slain, and hearts<br>depressed,&#8212;thoroughly confounded[396] and huddling close to one another,<br>sought Bhishma's protection along with all thy sons. And in that battle<br>Bhishma the son of Santanu became their protector. Struck with fear,<br>car-warriors jumping down from their cars, cavalry soldiers jumping down<br>from the backs of their steeds, and the foot-soldiers where they stood,<br>all began to fall down on the earth. Hearing the twang of Gandiva that<br>resembled the roar of the thunder, all thy warriors were struck with fear<br>and seemed, O Bharata, to melt away. Then, O king, with many huge and<br>fleet steeds of the Kamvoja breed, and surrounded by many thousand of<br>Gopas with a large Gopayana force and supported by the Madras, the<br>Sauviras, the Gandharas and the Trigartas, and surrounded by all the<br>principal Kalingas, the king of the Kalingas, and king Jayadratha<br>accompanied by all the kings and supported by a large force of diverse<br>races with Dussasana at their head, and fourteen thousand principal<br>horsemen, urged by thy son, surrounded the son of Suvala (for supporting<br>him). Then in that battle, all the Pandavas, united together, and riding<br>on separate cars and animals, began, O bull of Bharata's race, to<br>slaughter thy troops.[397] And the dust raised by car-warriors and steeds<br>and foot-soldiers, looking like a mass of clouds, made the field of<br>battle exceedingly awful. And with a large force consisting of elephants,<br>steeds and cars, and armed with lances and bearded darts and broad-headed<br>shafts, Bhishma engaged in battle with the diadem decked (Arjuna). And<br>the king of Avanti engaged with the ruler of Kasi, and the ruler of the<br>Sindhus engaged with Bhimasena. And king Yudhishthira with his sons and<br>counsellors engaged with Salya, the famous chief of the Madras. And<br>Vikarna engaged with Sahadeva, and Chitrasena with Sikhandin. And the<br>Matsyas, O king, engaged with Duryodhana, and Sakuni; and Drupada and<br>Chekitana, and that mighty car-warrior Satyaki engaged in battle with the<br>high-souled Drona aided by his son. And Kripa and Kritavarman both rushed<br>against Dhrishtadyumna. And thus, all over the field, rushing bodies of<br>horses, of elephants and cars, engaged with one another in battle. And<br>although there were no clouds in the sky, yet flashes of lightning were<br>seen. And all the points of the compass were covered with dust. And, O<br>king, fierce meteors were seen failing with thundering noise. And violent<br>winds blew and a shower of dust fell from above. And the sun, covered by<br>the dust raised by the troops, disappeared in the firmament. And all the<br>warriors, covered by that dust and battling with weapons, were deprived<br>of their senses. And the sound made by weapons, all capable of<br>penetrating through every armour and hurled from heroic arms, became a<br>tremendous uproar. And, O bull of Bharata's race, weapons hurled from<br>excellent arms and possessed of stellar brightness, illumined the whole<br>welkin. And variegated shields made of bull's hides and embossed with<br>gold were strewn, O bull of Bharata's race, all over the field. And heads<br>and limbs were seen falling on all sides, cut off with swords and<br>scimitars possessed of solar effulgence. And great car-warriors, the<br>wheels, axles, and boxes of whose cars were broken, fell down on the<br>ground, their steeds slain and their tall standards tumbling down.[398]<br>And many car-warriors having been slain, their steeds, mangled with<br>weapons, fell down as they ran dragging the cars (to which they were<br>yoked). And, in many places over the field, excellent steeds, afflicted<br>with arrows, with limbs mangled, and with their traces on, ran, dragging<br>the car-yokes after them. And many car-warriors, with their charioteers<br>and steeds, were seen, O king, to be crushed by single elephants endued<br>with great strength.[399] And in that battle, in the midst of large<br>forces, many elephants, scenting the odour of the temporal juice of their<br>compeers, began to snuff the breeze repeatedly. And the whole field was<br>strewn with slain elephants, deprived of life by means of broad-headed<br>shafts and falling down with the wooden edifices and the guides on their<br>backs. And many elephants, in, the midst of large forces crushed, with<br>the standards and warriors on their backs, by huge compeers urged by<br>their guides, fell down on the field. And many car-shafts, O king, were<br>seen to be broken in that battle by huge elephants using their trunks,<br>each of which resembled the trunk of the prince of elephants (called<br>Airavata). And many car-warriors also, in that conflict, the Jalas of<br>whose cars had been broken, were like branches of trees dragged down by<br>tuskers, seized by the hair of their heads and, thrashed violently on the<br>ground, were crushed into shapeless masses. And other huge elephants,<br>dragging cars that were entangled with other cars, ran in all directions<br>shrieking loudly. And those elephants, thus dragging those cars, looked<br>like others of their species dragging lotus-stalks growing in lakes. And<br>thus was that vast field of battle strewn over with cavalry soldiers and<br>foot-soldiers and great car-warriors and standards."
