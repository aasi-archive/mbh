                            "Arjuna said, 'How did Agni and Shoma, in days of yore, attain to<br>uniformity in respect of their original nature? This doubt has arisen in<br>my mind. Do thou dispel it, O slayer of Madhu!'<br><br>"The highly and holy one said, 'I shall recite to thee, O son of Pandu,<br>an ancient story of incidents originating from my own energy. Do thou<br>listen to it with rapt attention! When four thousand Yugas according to<br>the measure of the celestials elapse, the dissolution of the universe<br>comes. The Manifest disappears into the Unmanifest. All creatures, mobile<br>and immobile, meet with destruction. Light, Earth, Wind, all disappear.<br>Darkness spreads over the universe which becomes one infinite expanse of<br>water. When that infinite waste of water only exists like Brahma without<br>second, it is neither day nor night. Neither aught nor naught exists;<br>neither manifest nor unmanifest. Then only undifferentiated Brahman<br>existed. When such is the condition of the universe, the foremost of<br>Beings, viz., springs from Tamas, the eternal and immutable Hari that is<br>the combination of the attributes (of omnipotence and the rest),<br>belonging to Narayana, that is indestructible and immortal, that is<br>without senses, that is inconceivable and unborn, that is Truth's self<br>fraught with compassion, that is endued with the form of existence which<br>the rays of the gem called Chintamani have, that causes diverse kinds of<br>inclinations to flow in diverse directions, that is divested of the<br>principles of hostility and deterioration and mortality and decay, that<br>is formless and all-pervading, and that is endued with the principle of<br>universal Creation and of Eternity without beginning, middle, or end.<br>There is authority for this assertion. The Sruti declares,&#8212;Day was not.<br>Night was not. Aught was not. Naught was not. In the beginning there was<br>only Tamas[1854] in the form of the universe, and she is the night of<br>Narayana of universal form. Even this is the meaning of the word Tamas.<br>From that Purusha (called Hari), thus born of Tamas and having Brahman<br>for his parent, started into existence the Being called Brahman. Brahman,<br>desiring to create creatures, caused Agni and Shoma to spring from his<br>own eyes. Afterwards when creatures came to be created, the created<br>persons came out in their due order as Brahmanas and Kshatriyas. He who<br>started into life as Shoma was none else than Brahma; and they that were<br>born as Brahmanas were all Shoma in reality. He who started into being as<br>Kshatriyas were none else than Agni. The Brahmanas became endued with<br>greater energy than the Kshatras. If you ask the reason why, the answer<br>is that this superiority of the Brahmanas to the Kshatriyas is an<br>attribute that is manifest to the whole world. It occurred as follows.<br>The Brahmanas represent the eldest creation as regards men. None were<br>created before, that was superior to the Brahmanas. He who offers food<br>into the mouth of a Brahmana is regarded as pouring libations into a<br>blazing fire (for gratifying the deities). I say that having ordained<br>things in comprising this way, the creation of creatures was accomplished<br>by Brahma. Having established all created Beings in their respective<br>positions, he upholds the three worlds. There occurs a declaration to the<br>same effect in the Mantras of the Srutis. Thou, O Agni, art the Hotri in<br>sacrifices, and the benefactor of the universe. Thou art the benefactor<br>of the deities, of men, and of all the worlds. There is (other) authority<br>also for this. Thou art, O Agni, the Hotri of the universe and of<br>sacrifices. Thou art the source through which the deities and men do good<br>to the universe. Agni is truly the Hotri and the performer of sacrifices.<br>Agni is again the Brahma of the sacrifice. No libations can be poured<br>into sacrificial fire without uttering mantras; there can be no penances<br>without a person to perform them; the worship of the deities and men and<br>the Rishis is accomplished by the libations poured with mantras. Hence, O<br>Agni, thou hast been regarded as the Hotri in sacrifices.[1855] Thou art,<br>again, all the other mantras that have been declared in respect of the<br>Homa rites of men. For the Brahmanas the duty is ordained of officiating<br>for others in the sacrifices they perform. The two other orders, viz.,<br>Kshatras and Vaisyas, that are included within the regenerate or<br>twice-born class, have not the same duty prescribed for them. Hence,<br>Brahmanas are like Agni, who uphold sacrifices. The sacrifices (which the<br>Brahmanas perform) strengthen the deities. Strengthened in this way, the<br>deities fructify the Earth (and thereby support all living creatures).<br>But the result that may be achieved by the foremost of sacrifices may as<br>well be accomplished through the mouth of the Brahmanas. That learned<br>person who offers food into the mouth of a Brahmana is said to pour<br>libations into the sacred fire for gratifying the deities. In this way<br>the Brahmanas have come to be regarded as Agni. They that are possessed<br>of learning adore Agni. Agni, is again, Vishnu. Entering all creatures,<br>he upholds their life-breaths. In this connection there is a verse sung<br>by Sanatkumara. Brahman, in creating the universe, first created the<br>Brahmanas. The Brahmanas become immortal by studying the Vedas, and<br>repair to heaven through the aid of such study. The intelligence, speech,<br>acts and observances, faith, and the penances of the Brahmanas uphold<br>both the Earth and the heaven like slings of strings upholding bovine<br>nectar.[1856] There is no duty higher than Truth. There is no superior<br>more worthy of reverence than the mother. There is none more efficient<br>than the Brahmana for conferring felicity both here and hereafter. The<br>inhabitants of those realms where Brahmanas have no certain means of<br>support (from lands or other kinds of property assigned to them) become<br>very miserable. There the oxen do not carry the people or draw the<br>plough, nor do vehicles of any kind bear them. There milk kept in jars is<br>never churned for yielding butter. On the other hand, the residents<br>become divested of prosperity of every kind, and betake themselves to the<br>ways of robbers (instead of being able to enjoy the blessings of<br>peace)[1857] In the Vedas, the Puranas, the histories, and other<br>authoritative writings, it is said that Brahmanas, who are the souls of<br>all creatures, who are the creators of all things, and who are<br>identifiable with all existent objects, sprang from the mouth of<br>Narayana. Indeed, it is said that the Brahmans first came at the time<br>when the great boon-giving god had restrained his speech as a penance and<br>the other orders have originated from the Brahmanas. The Brahmanas are<br>distinguished above the deities and Asuras, since they were created by<br>myself in my indescribable form as Brahma. As I have created the deities<br>and the Asuras and the great Rishis so I have placed the Brahmanas in<br>their respective situations and have to punish them occasionally. In<br>consequence of his licentious assault on Ahalya, Indra was cursed by<br>Gautama, her husband, through which Indra got a green beard on his face.<br>Through that curse of Kausika Indra lost, also, his own testicles, which<br>loss was afterwards (through the kindness of the other deities) made up<br>by the substitution of the testicles of a ram. When in the sacrifice of<br>king Sarjiati, the great Rishi Chyavana became desirous of making the<br>twin Aswins sharers of the sacrificial offerings, Indra objected. Upon<br>Chyavana insisting, Indra sought to hurl his thunderbolt at him. The<br>Rishi paralysed Indra's arms. Incensed at the destruction of his<br>sacrifice by Rudra, Daksha once more set himself to the practice of<br>severe austerities and attaining to high puissance caused something like<br>a third eye to appear on the forehead of Rudra for the destruction of<br>Tripurasura.[1858] When Rudra addressed himself for the destruction of<br>the triple city belonging to the Asuras, the preceptor of the Asuras,<br>viz., Usanas, provoked beyond endurance, tore a matted lock from his own<br>head and hurled it at Rudra. From that matted lock of Usanas sprang many<br>serpents. Those serpents began to bite Rudra, at which his throat became<br>blue. During a bygone period, viz., that connected with the Self-born<br>Manu,[1859] it is said that Narayana had seized Rudra by the throat and<br>hence did Rudra's throat become blue. On the occasion of churning the<br>Ocean for raising the amrita, Vrihaspati of Angiras race sat on the<br>shores of the Ocean for performing the rite of Puruscharana. When he took<br>up a little water for the purpose of the initial achamana, the water<br>seemed to him to be very muddy. At this Vrihaspati became angry and<br>cursed the Ocean, saying,&#8212;Since thou continuest to be so dirty<br>regardless of the fact of my having come to thee for touching thee, since<br>thou hast not become clear and transparent, therefore from this day thou<br>shalt be tainted with fishes and sharks and tortoises and other aquatic<br>animals. From that time, the waters of the ocean have become infested<br>with diverse kinds of sea-animals and monsters. Viswarupa, the son of<br>Tashtri, formerly became the priest of the deities. He was, on his<br>mother's side, related to the Asuras, for his mother was the daughter of<br>an Asura. While publicly offering unto the deities their shares of<br>sacrificial offerings, he privately offered shares thereof unto the<br>Asuras. The Asuras, with their chief Hiranyakasipu at their head, then<br>repaired to their sister, the mother of Viswarupa, and solicited a boon<br>from her, saying,&#8212;The son Viswarupa by Tashtri, otherwise called<br>Trisiras, is now the priest of the deities. While he gives unto the<br>deities their shares of sacrificial offerings publicly, he gives us our<br>shares of the same privately. In consequence of this, the deities are<br>being aggrandised, and we are being weakened. It behoveth thee,<br>therefore, to prevail upon him that he may take up our cause. Thus<br>addressed by them, the mother of Viswarupa repaired to her son who was<br>then staying in the Nandana woods (of Indra) and said unto him,&#8212;How is<br>it, O son, that thou art engaged in aggrandising the cause of thy foes<br>and weakening that of thy maternal uncles? It behoveth thee not to act in<br>this way.&#8212;Viswarupa, thus solicited by his mother, thought that he<br>should not disobey her words, and as the consequence of that reflection<br>he went over to the side of Hiranyakasipu, after having paid proper<br>respects to his mother. King Hiranyakasipu, upon the arrival of Trisiras,<br>dismissed his old Hotri, viz., Vasishtha, the son of Brahma, and<br>appointed Trisiras to that office. Incensed at this, Vasishtha cursed<br>Hiranyakasipu, saying,&#8212;Since thou dismissest me and appointest another<br>person as thy Hotri, this sacrifice of thine shall not be completed, and<br>some Being the like of whom has not existed before will slay thee!&#8212;In<br>consequence of this curse, Hiranyakasipu was slain by Vishnu in the form<br>of a man-lion, Viswarupa, having adopted the side of his maternal<br>relations, employed himself in severe austerities for aggrandising them.<br>Impelled by the desire of causing him to swerve from his vows, Indra<br>despatched to him many beautiful Apsaras. Beholding those celestial<br>nymphs of transcendent beauty, the heart of Viswarupa became agitated.<br>Within a very short time he became exceedingly attached to them.<br>Understanding that he had become attached to them, the celestial nymphs<br>said unto him one day,&#8212;We shall not tarry here any longer. In fact, we<br>shall return to that place whence we came. Unto them that said so, the<br>son of Tashtri replied,&#8212;Where will you go? Stay with me. I shall do you<br>good. Hearing him say so, the Apsaras rejoined,&#8212;We are celestial nymphs<br>called Apsaras. We chose in days of old the illustrious and boon-giving<br>Indra of great puissance, Viswarupa then said unto them. This very day I<br>shall so ordain that all the deities with Indra at their head shall cease<br>to be. Saying this, Trisiras began to recite mentally certain sacred<br>Mantras of great efficacy. By virtue of those Mantras he began to<br>increase in energy. With one of his mouths he began to drink all the Soma<br>that Brahmanas engaged in Sacrifices poured on their sacred fires with<br>due rites. With a second mouth he began to eat all food (that was offered<br>in sacrifices). With his third mouth he began to drink up the energy of<br>all the deities with Indra at their head. Beholding him swelling with<br>energy in every part of his body that was strengthened by the Soma he was<br>drinking, all the deities, then, with Indra in their company, proceeded<br>to the Grandsire Brahma. Arrived at his presence, they addressed him and<br>said,&#8212;All the Soma that is duly offered in the sacrifices performed<br>everywhere is being drunk by Viswarupa. We no longer obtain our shares.<br>The Asuras are being aggrandised, while we are being weakened. It<br>behoveth thee, therefore, to ordain what is for our good.&#8212;After the<br>deities ceased, the Grandsire replied,&#8212;The great Rishi Dadhichi of<br>Bhrigu's race is now engaged in performing severe austerities. Go, ye<br>deities, unto him and solicit a boon from him. Do ye so arrange that he<br>may cast off his body. With his bones let a new weapon be created called<br>the Thunderbolt. Thus instructed by the Grandsire, the deities proceeded<br>to that place where the holy Rishi Dadhichi was engaged in his<br>austerities. The deities with Indra at their head addressed the sage,<br>saying,&#8212;O holy one, your austerities, we hope, are being well performed<br>and uninterrupted.&#8212;Unto them the sage Dadhichi said,&#8212;Welcome to all of<br>you. Tell me what I should do for you. I shall certainly do what you will<br>say. They then told him,&#8212;It behoveth thee to cast off thy body for<br>benefiting all the worlds. Thus solicited, the sage Dadhichi, who was a<br>great Yogin and who regarded happiness and misery in the same light,<br>without being at all cheerless, concentrated his Soul by his Yoga power<br>and cast off his body. When his Soul left its temporary tenement of clay,<br>Dhatri, taking his bones, created an irresistible weapon called the<br>Thunder-bolt. With the Thunder-bolt thus made with the bones of a<br>Brahmana, which was impenetrable by other weapons and irresistible and<br>pervaded by the energy of Vishnu, Indra struck Viswarupa the son of<br>Tashtri. Having slain the son of Tashtri thus, Indra severed his head<br>from the body. From the lifeless body, however, of Viswarupa, when it was<br>pressed, the energy that was still residing in it gave birth to a mighty<br>Asura of the name of Vritra. Vritra became the foe of Indra, but Indra<br>slew him also with the Thunder-bolt. In consequence of the sin of<br>Brahmanicide, being thus doubled Indra became overcome with a great fear<br>and as the consequence thereof he had to abandon the sovereignty of<br>heaven. He entered a cool lotus stalk that grew in the Manas lake. In<br>consequence of the Yoga attribute of Anima, he became very minute and<br>entered the fibres of that lotus stalk.[1860] When the lord of the three<br>worlds, the husband of Sachi, had thus disappeared from sight through<br>fear of the sin of Brahmanicide, the universe became lordless. The<br>attributes of Rajas and Tamas assailed the deities. The Mantras uttered<br>by the great Rishis lost all efficacy. Rakshasas appeared everywhere The<br>Vedas were about to disappear. The inhabitants of all the worlds, being<br>destitute of a king, lost their strength and began to fall an easy prey<br>to Rakshasas and other evil Beings. Then the deities and the Rishis,<br>uniting together, made Nahusha, the son of Ayusha, the king of the three<br>worlds and duly crowned him as such. Nahusha had on his forehead full<br>five-hundred luminaries of blazing effulgence, which had the virtue of<br>despoiling every creature of energy. Thus equipt Nahusha continued to<br>rule heaven. The three worlds were restored to their normal condition.<br>The inhabitants of the universe once more became happy and cheerful.<br>Nahusha then said,&#8212;Everything that Indra used to enjoy is before me.<br>Only, his spouse Sachi is not by. Having said this, Nahusha proceeded to<br>where Sachi was and, addressing her, said,&#8212;O blessed lady, I have become<br>the lord of the deities. Do thou accept me. Unto him Sachi replied,<br>saying&#8212;Thou art, by nature, wedded to righteousness of behaviour. Thou<br>belongest, again, to the race of Shoma. It behoveth thee not to assail<br>another person's wife.&#8212;Nahusha, thus addressed by her, said,&#8212;The<br>position of Indra is now being occupied by me. I deserve to enjoy the<br>dominions and all the precious possessions of Indra. In desiring to enjoy<br>thee there can be no sin. Thou wert Indra's and, therefore, should be<br>mine. Sachi then said unto him,&#8212;I am observing a vow that has not yet<br>been completed. After performing the final ablutions I shall come to thee<br>within a few days. Extracting this promise from Indra's spouse, Nahusha<br>left her presence. Meanwhile Sachi, afflicted with pain and grief,<br>anxious to find her lord and assailed by her fear of Nahusha proceeded to<br>Vrihaspati (the chief priest of the celestials). At the first sight<br>Vrihaspati understood her to be struck with anxiety. He immediately had<br>recourse to Yoga-meditation and learnt that she was intent upon doing<br>what was necessary for restoring her husband to his true position.<br>Vrihaspati then addressed her, saying,&#8212;Equipt with penances and the<br>merit that will be thine in consequence of this vow that thou art<br>observing, do thou invoke the boon-giving goddess Upasruti. Invoked by<br>thee, she will appear and show thee where thy husband is dwelling.&#8212;While<br>in the observance of that very austere vow, she invoked with the aid of<br>proper Mantras the boon-giving goddess Upasruti. Invoked by Sachi, the<br>goddess presented herself before her and said,&#8212;I am here at thy bidding.<br>Invoked by thee I have come. What cherished wish of thine shall I<br>accomplish? Bowing unto her with a bend of the head, Sachi said,&#8212;O<br>blessed lady, it behoveth thee to show me where my husband is. Thou art<br>Truth. Thou art Rita. Thus addressed, the goddess Upasruti took her to<br>the lake Manasa. Arrived there, she pointed out to Sachi her lord Indra<br>residing within the fibres of a lotus stalk. Beholding his spouse pale<br>and emaciated, Indra became exceedingly anxious. And the lord of heaven<br>said unto himself, Alas, great is the sorrow that has overtaken me. I<br>have fallen off from the position that is mine. This my spouse, afflicted<br>with grief on my account, finds out my lost self and comes to me here.<br>Having reflected in this strain, Indra addressed his dear spouse and<br>said,&#8212;In what condition art thou now? She answered him,&#8212;Nahusha invites<br>me to make me his wife. I have obtained a respite from him, having fixed<br>the time when I am to go to him. Unto her Indra then said, Go and say<br>unto Nahusha that he should come to thee on a vehicle never used before,<br>viz., one unto which some Rishis should be harnessed, and arriving at<br>thine in that state he should wed thee. Indra has many kinds of vehicles<br>that are all beautiful and charming. All these have borne thee. Nahusha,<br>however, should come on such a vehicle that Indra himself had not<br>possessed. Thus counselled by her lord, Sachi left that spot with a<br>joyous heart. Indra also once more entered the fibres of that<br>lotus-stalk. Beholding the Queen of Indra come back to heaven, Nahusha<br>addressed her saying, The time thou hadst fixed is over. Unto him Sachi<br>said what Indra had directed her to say. Harnessing a number of great<br>Rishis unto the vehicle he rode, Nahusha set out from his place for<br>coming to where Sachi was living. The foremost of Rishis, viz., Agastya,<br>born within a jar, of the vital seed of Maitravaruna, beheld those<br>foremost of Rishis insulted by Nahusha in that way. Him Nahusha struck<br>with his foot. Unto him, Agastya said,&#8212;Wretch, as thou hast betaken<br>thyself to a highly improper act, do thou fall down on the Earth. Be<br>transformed into a snake and do thou continue to live in that form as<br>long as the Earth and her hills continue. As soon as these words were<br>uttered by the great Rishi, Nahusha fell down from that vehicle. The<br>three worlds once more became master-less. The deities and the Rishis<br>then united together and proceeded to where Vishnu was and appealed to<br>him for bringing about the restoration of Indra. Approaching him, they<br>said,&#8212;O holy one, it behoveth thee to rescue Indra who is overwhelmed by<br>the sin of Brahmanicide. The boon-giving Vishnu replied unto them,<br>saying,&#8212;Let Sakra perform a Horse-sacrifice in honour of Vishnu. He will<br>then be restored to his former position. The deities and the Rishis began<br>to search for Indra, but when they could not find him, they went to Sachi<br>and said unto her,&#8212;O blessed lady, go unto Indra and bring him here.<br>Requested by them, Sachi once more proceeded to the lake Manasa. Indra,<br>rising from the lake, came to Vrihaspati. The celestial priest Vrihaspati<br>then made arrangements for a great Horse-sacrifice, substituting a black<br>antelope for a good steed every way fit to be offered up in sacrifice.<br>Causing Indra, the lord of the Maruts, to ride upon that very steed<br>(which was saved from slaughter) Vrihaspati led him to his own place. The<br>lord of heaven was then adored with hymns by all the deities and the<br>Rishis. He continued to rule in heaven, cleansed of the sin of<br>Brahmanicide which was divided into four portions and ordained to reside<br>in woman, fire, trees, and kine. It was thus that Indra, strengthened by<br>the energy of a Brahmana, succeeded in slaying his foe (and when, as the<br>result of that act of his, he had been overpowered by sin, it was the<br>energy of another Brahmana that rescued him). It was thus that Indra once<br>more regained his position.<br><br>"'In days of yore, while the great Rishi Bharadwaja was saying his<br>prayers by the side of the celestial Ganga, one of the three feet of<br>Vishnu, when he assumed his three-footed form, reached that spot.[1861]<br>Beholding that strange sight, Bharadwaja assailed Vishnu with a handful<br>of water, upon which Vishnu's bosom received a mark (called<br>Sreevatsa)[1862]. Cursed by that foremost of Rishis, viz., Bhrigu, Agni<br>was obliged to become a devourer of all things. Once on a time, Aditi,<br>the mother of the deities, cooked some food for her sons. She thought<br>that, eating that food and strengthened by it, the deities would succeed<br>in slaying the Asuras. After the food had been cooked. Vudha (the<br>presiding deity of the luminary known by that name), having completed the<br>observance of an austere vow, presented himself before Aditi and said<br>unto her,&#8212;Give me alms. Aditi, though thus solicited for food gave him<br>none, thinking that no one should eat of the food she had cooked, before<br>her sons, the deities, had first taken it. Incensed at the conduct of<br>Aditi who thus refused to give him alms, Vudha, who was Brahma's self<br>through the austere vow he had completed, cursed her, saying that as<br>Aditi had refused him alms she would have a pain in her womb when<br>Vivaswat, in his second birth in the womb of Aditi, would be born in the<br>form of an egg. Aditi reminded Vivaswat at that time of the curse of<br>Vudha, and it is for that reason that Vivaswat, the deity who is adorned<br>in Sraddhas, coming out of the womb of Aditi, came to be called by the<br>name of Martanda. The Prajapati Daksha became the father of sixty<br>daughters. Amongst them, three and ten were bestowed by him upon Kasyapa;<br>ten upon Dharma; ten upon Mann; and seven and twenty upon Shoma. Although<br>all the seven and twenty that were called Nakshatras and bestowed upon<br>Shoma were equal in respect of beauty and accomplishments, yet Shoma<br>became more attached to one, viz., Rohini, than the rest. The rest of his<br>spouses, filled with jealousy, leaving him, repaired to their sire and<br>informed him of this conduct of their husband, saying,&#8212;O holy one,<br>although all of us are equal in point of beauty, yet our husband Shoma is<br>exclusively attached to our sister Rohini.&#8212;Incensed at this<br>representation of his daughters, the celestial Rishi Daksha cursed Shoma,<br>saying, that thenceforth the disease phthisis should assail his<br>son-in-law and dwell in him. Through this curse of Daksha, phthisis<br>assailed the puissant Shoma and entered into his body. Assailed by<br>phthisis in this way, Shoma came to Daksha. The latter addressed him,<br>saying,&#8212;I have cursed thee because of thy unequal behaviour towards thy<br>wives. The Rishi then said unto Shoma,&#8212;Thou art being reduced by the<br>disease phthisis that has assailed thee. There is a sacred water called<br>Hiranyasarah in the Western ocean. Repairing to that sacred water, do<br>thou bathe there.&#8212;Counselled by the Rishi, Shoma proceeded thither.<br>Arrived at Hiranyasarah, Soma bathed in that sacred water. Performing his<br>oblations he 'cleansed himself from his sin. And because that sacred<br>water was illumined (abhasita) by Shoma, therefore was it from that day<br>called by the name of Prabhasa. In consequence, however, of the curse<br>denounced upon him in days of old by Daksha, Shoma, to this day, begins<br>to wane from the night of the full moon till his total disappearance on<br>the night of the new moon whence he once more begins to wax till the<br>night of full moon. The brightness also of the lunar disc from that time<br>received a stain, for the body of Shoma, since then, has come to present<br>certain dark spots. In fact, the splendid disc of the moon has, from that<br>day, come to exhibit the mark of a hare. Once on a time, a Rishi of the<br>name of Sthulasiras was engaged in practising very severe austerities on<br>the northern breasts of the mountains of Meru. While engaged in those<br>austerities, a pure breeze, charged with all kinds of delicious perfumes,<br>began to blow there and fan his body. Scorched as his body was by the<br>very severe austerities he was undergoing, and living as he did upon air<br>alone to the exclusion of every kind of food, he became highly gratified<br>in consequence of that delicious breeze which blew around him. While he<br>was thus gratified with the delicious breeze that fanned him, the trees<br>around him (moved by jealousy) put forth their flowers for making a<br>display and extorting his praise. Displeased at this conduct of the trees<br>because it was dictated by jealousy, the Rishi cursed them,<br>saying,&#8212;Henceforth, ye shall not be able to put forth your flowers at<br>all times.&#8212;In days of yore, for doing good to the world, Narayana took<br>birth as the great Rishi Vadavamukha. While engaged in practising severe<br>austerities on the breast of Meru, he summoned the Ocean to his presence.<br>The Ocean, however, disobeyed his summons. Incensed at this, the Rishi,<br>with the heat of his body, caused the waters of the Ocean to become as<br>saltish in taste as the human sweat. The Rishi further said.&#8212;Thy waters<br>shall henceforth cease to be drinkable. Only when the Equine-head, roving<br>within thee, will drink thy waters, they will be as sweet as honey. It is<br>for this curse that the waters of the Ocean to this day are saltish to<br>the taste and are drunk by no one else than the Equine-head.[1863] The<br>daughter, named Uma, of the Himavat mountains, was desired by Rudra in<br>marriage After Himavat had promised the hand of Uma to Mahadeva, the<br>great Rishi Bhrigu, approaching Himavat, addressed him, saying,&#8212;Give<br>this daughter of thine unto me in marriage. Himavat replied unto him,<br>saying,&#8212;Rudra is the bridegroom already selected by me for my<br>daughter.&#8212;Angry at this reply, Bhrigu said,&#8212;Since thou refusest my suit<br>for the hand of thy daughter and insultest me thus, thou shalt no longer<br>abound with jewels and gems. To this day, in consequence of the Rishi's<br>words, the mountains of Himavat have not any jewels and gems. Even such<br>is the glory of the Brahmanas. It is through the favour of the Brahmanas<br>that the Kshatriyas are able to possess the eternal and undeteriorating<br>Earth as their wife and enjoy her. The power of the Brahmanas, again, is<br>made up of Agni and Shoma. The universe is upheld by that power and,<br>therefore, is upheld by Agni and Shoma united together. It is said that<br>Surya and Chandramas are the eyes of Narayana. The rays of Surya<br>constitute my eyes. Each of them, viz., the Sun and the Moon, invigorate<br>and warm the universe respectively. And because of the Sun and the Moon<br>thus warming and invigorating the universe, they have come to be regarded<br>as the Harsha (joy) of the universe. It is in consequence of these acts<br>of Agni and Shoma that uphold the universe that I have come to be called<br>by the name of Hrishikesa, O son of Pandu. Indeed, I am the boon-giving<br>Isana, the Creator of the universe.[1864] Through virtue of the Mantras<br>with which libations of clarified butter are poured on the sacred fire, I<br>take and appropriate the (principal) share of the offerings made in<br>sacrifices. My complexion also is of that foremost of gems called Harit.<br>It is for these reasons that I am called by the name of Hari. I am the<br>highest abode of all creatures and am regarded by persons conversant with<br>the scriptures to be identical with Truth or Nectar. I am, for this<br>reason, called by learned Brahmanas by the name of Ritadhama (abode of<br>Truth or Nectar). When in days of yore the Earth became submerged in the<br>waters and lost to the view, I found her out and raised her from the<br>depths of the Ocean. For this reason the deities adore me by the name of<br>Govinda. Sipivishta is another name of mine. The word Sipi indicates a<br>person that has no hair on his body. He who pervades all things in the<br>form of Sipi is known by the name of Sipivishta. The Rishi Yaksha, with<br>tranquil soul, in many a sacrifice invoked me by the name Sipivishta. It<br>is for this reason that I came to bear this secret name. Yaksha of great<br>intelligence, having adored me by the name Sipivishta, succeeded in<br>restoring the Niruktas which had disappeared from the surface of the<br>Earth and sunk into nether regions. I was never born. I never take birth.<br>Nor shall I ever be born. I am the Kshetrajna of all creatures. Hence am<br>I called by the name of Aja (unborn).[1865] I have never uttered anything<br>base or anything that is obscene. The divine Saraswati who is Truth's<br>self, who is the daughter of Brahma and is otherwise called by the name<br>of Rita, represents my speech and always dwells in my tongue. The<br>existent and the non-existent have been merged by me in my Soul. The<br>Rishis dwelling in Pushkara, which is regarded as the abode of Brahman,<br>called me by the name of Truth. I have never swerved from the attribute<br>of Sattwa, and know that the attribute of Sattwa has flowed from me. In<br>this birth also of mine, O Dhananjaya, my ancient attribute of Sattwa has<br>not left me, so that in even this life, establishing myself on Sattwa, I<br>set myself to acts without ever wishing for their fruits. Cleansed of all<br>sins as I am through the attribute of Sattwa, which is my nature, I can<br>be beheld by the aid of that knowledge only which arises from adoption of<br>the attribute of Sattwa. I am reckoned also among those that are wedded<br>to that attribute. For these reasons am I known by the name of<br>Sattwata.[1866] I till the Earth, assuming the form of a large<br>plough-share of black iron. And because my complexion is black, therefore<br>am I called by the name of Krishna. I have united the Earth with Water,<br>Space with Mind, and Wind with Light. Therefore ant I called<br>Vaikuntha.[1867] The cessation of separate conscious existence by<br>identification with Supreme Brahman is the highest attribute or condition<br>for a living agent to attain. And since I have never swerved from that<br>attribute or condition, I am, therefore, called by the name of<br>Achyuta.[1868] The Earth and the Firmament are known to extend in all<br>directions. And because I uphold them both, therefore am I called by the<br>name of Adhokshaja. Persons conversant with the Vedas and employed in<br>interpreting the words used in those scriptures adore me in sacrifices by<br>calling upon me by the same name. In days of yore, the great Rishis,<br>while engaged in practising severe austerities, said,&#8212;No one else in the<br>universe than the puissant Narayana, is capable of being called by the<br>name of Adhokshaja. Clarified butter which sustains the lives of all<br>creatures in the universe constitutes my effulgence. It is for this<br>reason that Brahmanas conversant with the Vedas and possessed of<br>concentrated souls call me by the name of Ghritarchis.[1869] There are<br>three well-known constituent elements of the body. They have their origin<br>in action, and are called Bile, Phlegm, and Wind. The body is called a<br>union of these three. All living creatures are upheld by these three, and<br>when these three become weakened, living creatures also become weakened.<br>It is for this reason that all persons conversant with the scriptures<br>bearing on the science of Life call me by the name of Tridhatu.[1870] The<br>holy Dharma is known among all creatures by the name of Vrisha, O<br>Bharata. Hence it is that I am called the excellent Vrisha in the Vedic<br>lexicon called Nighantuka. The word 'Kapi' signifies the foremost of<br>boars, and Dharma is otherwise known by the name of Vrisha. It is for<br>this reason that that lord of all creatures, viz., Kasyapa, the common<br>sire of the deities and the Asuras, called me by the name Vrishakapi. The<br>deities and the Asuras have never been able to ascertain my beginning, my<br>middle, or my end. It is for this reason that I am sung as Anadi, Amadhya<br>and Ananta. I am the Supreme Lord endued with puissance, and I am the<br>eternal witness of the universe (beholding as I do its successive<br>creations and destructions). I always hear words that are pure and holy,<br>O Dhananjaya, and never hold anything that is sinful. Hence am I called<br>by the name of Suchisravas. Assuming, in days of old, the form of a boar<br>with a single tusk, O enhancer of the joys of others, I raised the<br>submerged Earth from the bottom of the ocean. From this reason am I<br>called by the name of Ekasringa. While I assumed the form of mighty boar<br>for this purpose, I had three humps on my back. Indeed, in consequence of<br>this peculiarity of my form at that time that I have come to be called by<br>the name of Trikakud (three-humped). Those who are conversant with the<br>science propounded by Kapila call the Supreme Soul by the name of<br>Virincha. That Virincha is otherwise called the great Prajapati (or<br>Brahman). Verily I am identical with Him, called Virincha, in consequence<br>of my imparting animation to all living creatures, for I am the Creator<br>of the universe. The preceptors of Sankhya philosophy, possessed of<br>definite conclusions (regarding all topics), call me the eternal Kapila<br>staying in the midst of the solar disc with but Knowledge for my<br>companion.[1871] On Earth I am known to be identical with Him who has<br>been sung in the Vedic verses as the effulgent Hiranyagarbha and who is<br>always worshipped by Yogins. I am regarded as the embodied form of the<br>Rich Veda consisting of one and twenty thousand verses. Persons<br>conversant with the Vedas also call me the embodiment of the Samans of a<br>thousand branches. Even thus do learned Brahmans that are my devoted<br>worshippers and that are very rare sing me in the Aranyakas.[1872] In the<br>Adhyaryus I am sung as the Yajur-Veda of six and fifty and eight and<br>seven and thirty branches.[1873] Learned Brahmans conversant with the<br>Atharvans regard me as identical with the Atharvans consisting of five<br>Kalpas and all the Krityas.[1874] All the sub-divisions that exist of the<br>different Vedas in respect of branches and all the verses that compose<br>those branches, and all the vowels that occur in those verses, and all<br>the rules in respect of pronunciation, know, O Dhananjaya, are my work. O<br>Partha, he that rises (at the beginning of Creation from the Ocean of<br>Milk at the earnest invocation of Brahmana and all the deities) and who<br>gives diverse boons unto the diverse deities, is none else than myself. I<br>am He who is the repository of the science of syllables and pronunciation<br>that is treated of in the supplementary portions of the Vedas. Following<br>the path pointed out by Vamadeva, the high-souled Rishi Panchala, through<br>my grace, obtained from that eternal Being the rules in respect of the<br>division of syllables and words (for reading the Vedas). Indeed, Galava,<br>born in the Vabhravya race, having attained to high ascetic success and<br>obtained a boon from Narayana, compiled the rules in respect of the<br>division of syllables and words (for reading the Vedas). Indeed, Galava,<br>born in the Vabhravya race, having attained to the high ascetic success<br>and obtained a boon from Narayana, compiled the rules in respect of the<br>division of syllables and words, and those about emphasis and accent in<br>utterance, and shone as the first scholar who became conversant with<br>those two subjects. Kundrika and king Brahmadatta of great energy,[1875]<br>repeatedly thinking of the sorrow that attends birth and death, attained<br>to that prosperity which is acquired by persons devoted to Yoga, in<br>course of seven births, in consequence of my favour. In days of yore, O<br>Partha, I was, for some reason, born as the son of Dharma, O chief of<br>Kuru's race, and in consequence of such birth of mine I was celebrated<br>under the name of Dharmaja. I took birth in two forms, viz., as Nara and<br>Narayana. Riding on the vehicle that helps towards the performance of<br>scriptural and other duties, I practised, in those two forms, undying<br>austerities on the breast of Gandhamadana[1876] At that time the great<br>sacrifice of Daksha took place. Daksha, however, in that sacrifice of<br>his, refused to give a share unto Rudra, O Bharata, of the sacrificial<br>offerings. Urged by the sage Dadhichi, Rudra destroyed that sacrifice. He<br>hurled a dart whose flames blazed up every moment. That dart, having<br>consumed all the preparations of Daksha's sacrifice, came with great<br>force towards us (Nara and Narayana) at the retreat of Vadari. With great<br>violence that dart then fell upon the chest of Narayana. Assailed by the<br>energy of that dart, the hair on the head of Narayana became green. In<br>fact, in consequence of this change in the hue of my hair I came to be<br>called by the name of Munjakesa.[1877] Driven off by an exclamation of<br>Hun which Narayana uttered, the dart, its energy being lost, returned to<br>Sankara's hands. At this, Rudra became highly angry and as the result<br>thereof he rushed towards the Rishis Nara and Narayana, endued with the<br>puissance of severe austerities. Narayana then seized the rushing Rudra<br>with his hand by the throat. Seized by Narayana, the lord of the<br>universe, Rudra's throat changed colour and became dark. From that time<br>Rudra came to be called by the name of Sitikantha. Meanwhile Nara, for<br>the purpose of destroying Rudra, took up a blade of grass, and inspired<br>it with Mantras. The blade of grass, thus inspired, was converted into a<br>mighty battle-axe. Nara suddenly hurled that battle-axe at Rudra but it<br>broke into pieces. In consequence of that weapon thus breaking into<br>pieces, I came to be called by the name of Khandaparasu.'[1878]<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'In that battle capable of bringing about the destruction<br>of the three worlds, who obtained the victory, O Janarddana, do thou tell<br>me this!'"<br><br>"The blessed and holy one said, 'When Rudra and Narayana became thus<br>engaged in battle, all the universe became suddenly filled with anxiety.<br>The deity of fire ceased to accept libations of even the purest clarified<br>butter duly poured in sacrifices with the aid of Vedic Mantras. The Vedas<br>no longer shone by inward light in the minds of the Rishis of cleansed<br>souls. The attributes of Rajas and Tamas possessed the deities. The Earth<br>trembled. The vault of the firmament seemed to divide in twain. All the<br>luminaries became deprived of their splendour. The Creator, Brahman,<br>himself fell from his seat. The Ocean itself became dry. The mountains of<br>Himavat became riven. When such dire omens appeared everywhere, O son of<br>Pandu, Brahma surrounded by all the deities and the high-souled Rishis,<br>soon arrived at that spot where the battle was raging. The four-faced<br>Brahma, capable of being understood with the aid of only the Niruktas,<br>joined his hands and addressing Rudra, said,&#8212;Let good happen to the<br>three worlds. Throw down thy weapons, O lord of the universe, from desire<br>of benefiting the universe. That which is unmanifest, indestructible,<br>immutable, supreme, the origin of the universe, uniform, and the supreme<br>actor, that which transcends all pairs of opposites, and is inactive,<br>has, choosing to be manifested, been pleased to assume this one blessed<br>form, (for though double, the two but represent the same form). This Nara<br>and Narayana (the displayed forms of Supreme Brahman) have taken birth in<br>the race of Dharma. The foremost of all deities, these two are observers<br>of the highest vows and endued with the severest penances. Through some<br>reason best known to Him, I myself have sprung from the attribute of His<br>Grace. Eternal as thou art, for thou hast ever existed since all the past<br>creations, thou too hast sprung from His Wrath. With myself then, these<br>deities, and all the great Rishis, do thou adore this displayed form of<br>Brahma, and let peace be unto all the worlds without any delay.&#8212;Thus<br>addressed by Brahma, Rudra forthwith cast off the fire of his wrath, and<br>set himself to gratify the illustrious and puissant God Narayana.[1879]<br>Indeed, he soon placed himself at the disposal of the adorable<br>boon-giving and puissant God Narayana. That boon-giving God Narayana, who<br>hath his wrath and the senses under control, soon became gratified and<br>reconciled with Rudra. Well-adored by the Rishis, by Brahma, and by all<br>the deities, that great God, the Lord of the universe, otherwise called<br>by the name of Hari, then addressed the illustrious Isana and said these<br>words:&#8212;He that knows thee, knows me. He that follows thee, follows me.<br>There is no difference between thee and me. Do thou never think<br>otherwise. The mark made by thy lance on my chest will from this day<br>assume the form of a beautiful whirl, and the mark of my hand on thy<br>throat will also assume a beautiful shape in consequence of which thou<br>shalt, from this day, be called by the name of Sreekantha.'"<br><br>"The blessed and holy one[1880] continued. 'Having mutually caused such<br>marks on each other's person, the two Rishis Nara and Narayana thus made<br>friends with Rudra. and dismissing the deities, once more set themselves<br>to the practice of penances with a tranquil soul. I have thus told thee,<br>O son of Pritha, how in that battle which took place in days of yore<br>between Rudra and Narayana, the latter got the victory. I have also told<br>thee the many secret names by which Narayana is called and what the<br>significations are, O Bharata, of one of those names, which, as I have<br>told thee, the Rishis, have bestowed upon the great God. In this way, O<br>son of Kunti, assuming diverse forms do I rove at will through the Earth,<br>the region of Brahma himself, and that other high and eternal region of<br>felicity called Goloka. Protected by me in the great battle, thou hast<br>won a great victory. That Being whom, at the time of all thy battles,<br>thou beheldest stalking in thy van, know, O son of Kunti, is no other<br>than Rudra, that god of gods, otherwise called by the name of Kaparddin.<br>He is otherwise known by the name of Kala,[1881] and should be known as<br>one that has sprung from my wrath. Those foes whom thou hast slain were<br>all, in the first instance, slain by him.[1882] Do thou bend thy head<br>unto that god of gods, that lord of Uma, endued with immeasurable<br>puissance With concentrated soul, do thou bend thy head unto that<br>illustrious Lord of the universe, that indestructible deity, otherwise<br>called by the name of Hari. He is none else than that deity who, as I<br>have repeatedly told thee, has sprung from my wrath. Thou hast, before<br>this, heard, O Dhananjaya, of the puissance and energy that reside in<br>him!'"
