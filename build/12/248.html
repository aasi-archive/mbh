                            "Vyasa said, 'The mind creates (within itself) numerous ideas (of objects<br>or existent things). The Understanding settles which is which. The heart<br>discriminates which is agreeable and which is disagreeable. These are the<br>three forces that impel to acts. The objects of the senses are superior<br>to the senses. The mind is superior to those objects. The understanding<br>is superior to mind. The Soul is regarded as superior to Understanding.<br>(As regards the ordinary purposes of man) the Understanding is his Soul.<br>When the understanding, of its own motion, forms ideas (of objects)<br>within itself, it then comes to be called Mind.[1049] In consequence of<br>the senses being different from one another (both in respect of their<br>objects and the manner of their operation), the Understanding (which is<br>one and the same) present different aspect in consequence of its<br>different modifications. When it hears, it becomes the organ of hearing,<br>and when it touches, it becomes the organ of touch. Similarly, when it<br>sees, it becomes the organ of vision, and when it tastes, it becomes the<br>organ of taste, and when it smells, it becomes the organ of scent. It is<br>the Understanding that appears under different guises (for different<br>functions) by modification. It is the modifications of the Understanding<br>that are called the senses. Over them is placed as their presiding chief<br>(or overseer) the invisible Soul. Residing in the body, the Understanding<br>exists in the three states (of Sattwa, Rajas, and, Tamas). Sometimes it<br>obtains cheerfulness, sometimes it gives way to grief; and sometimes its<br>condition becomes such that it is united with neither cheerfulness nor<br>grief. The Understanding, however, whose chief function (as already said)<br>is to create entities, transcends those three states even as the ocean,<br>that lord of rivers, prevails against the mighty currents of the rivers<br>that fall into it.[1050] When the Understanding desires for anything, it<br>comes to be called by the name of Mind. The senses again, though<br>(apparently different) should all be taken as included within the<br>Understanding. The senses, which are engaged in bearing impressions of<br>form, scent etc., should all be subdued.[1051] When a particular sense<br>becomes subservient to the Understanding, the latter though in reality<br>not different (from that sense), enters the Mind in the form of existent<br>things. Even this is what happens with the senses one after another<br>(separately and not simultaneously) with reference to the ideas that are<br>said to be apprehended by them.[1052] All the three states that exist<br>(viz., Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas), inhere to these three (viz., Mind,<br>Understanding, and Consciousness) and like the spokes of a car-wheel<br>acting in consequence of their attachment to the circumference of the<br>wheel, they follow the different objects (that exist in Mind,<br>Understanding, and Consciousness).[1053] The mind must make a lamp of the<br>senses for dispelling the darkness that shuts out the knowledge of the<br>Supreme Soul. This knowledge that is acquired by Yogins with the aid of<br>all especial agency of Yoga, is acquired without any especial efforts by<br>men that abstain from worldly objects.[1054] The universe is of this<br>nature (viz., it is only a creation of the understanding). The man of<br>knowledge, therefore, is never stupefied (by attachment to things of this<br>world). Such a man never grieves, never rejoices, and is free from envy<br>(at seeing another possessing a larger share of earthly objects). The<br>Soul is incapable of being seen with the aid of the senses whose nature<br>is to wander among all (earthly) objects of desire. Even righteous men,<br>whose senses are pure, fail to behold the soul with their aid, what then<br>should be said of the vicious whose senses are impure? When, however, a<br>person, with the aid of his mind, tightly holds their reins, it is then<br>that his Soul discovers itself like an object (unseen in darkness)<br>appearing to the view in consequence of the light of a lamp. Indeed, as<br>all things become visible when the darkness that envelopes them is<br>dispelled, even the soul becomes visible when the darkness that covers it<br>is removed.[1055] As an aquatic fowl, though moving on the water, is<br>never drenched by that element, after the same manner the Yogin of freed<br>soul is never soiled by the imperfections of the three attributes (of<br>Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas). After the same manner, the man of wisdom, by<br>even enjoying all earthly objects without being attached to any of them,<br>is never soiled by faults of any kind that arise in the case of others<br>from such enjoyment. He who avoids acts after having done them<br>duly,[1056] and takes delight in the one really existent entity, viz.,<br>the Soul, who has constituted himself the soul of all created beings, and<br>who succeeds in keeping himself aloof from the three attributes, obtains<br>an understanding and senses that are created by the Soul. The qualities<br>are incapable of apprehending the Soul. The Soul, however, apprehends<br>them always. The Soul is the witness that beholds the qualities and duly<br>calls them up into being. Behold, this is the difference between the<br>understanding and the Soul both of which are exceedingly subtile. One of<br>them creates the qualities. The other never creates them. Though they are<br>different from each other by nature, yet they are always united. The fish<br>living in the water is different from the element in which it lives. But<br>as the fish and the water forming its home are always united, after the<br>same manner Sattwa and Kshetrajna exists in a state of union. The gnat<br>born within a rotten fig is really not the fig but different from it.<br>Nevertheless, as the gnat and the fig are seen to be united with each<br>other, even so are Sattwa and Kshetrajna. As the blade in a clump of<br>grass, though distinct from the clump, nevertheless exists in a state of<br>union with it, even so these two, though different from each other, each<br>existing in its own self, are to be seen in a state of constant union.'"
