                            Vaisampayana said, "After the conclusion of Arjuna's speech, Bhimasena of<br>great wrath and energy, mustering all his patience, said these words unto<br>his eldest brother, 'Thou art, O monarch, conversant with all duties.<br>There is nothing unknown to thee. We always wish to imitate thy conduct,<br>but, alas, we cannot do it!&#8212;"I will not say anything! I will not say<br>anything&#8212;! Even this is what I had wished! Impelled, however, by great<br>grief I am constrained to say something. Listen to these words of mine, O<br>ruler of men! Through the stupefaction of thy faculties, everything is<br>endangered, and ourselves are being made cheerless and weak. How is it<br>that thou that art the ruler of the world, thou that art conversant with<br>all branches of knowledge, sufferest thy understanding to be clouded, in<br>consequence of cheerlessness, like a coward? The righteous and<br>unrighteous paths of the world are known to thee. There is nothing<br>belonging either to the future or the present that is also unknown to<br>thee, O puissant one! When such is the case, O monarch, I will indicate,<br>O ruler of men, the reasons in favour of your assuming sovereignty.<br>Listen to me with undivided attention. There are two kinds of diseases,<br>viz., physical and mental. Each springs from the other. None of them can<br>be seen existing independently. Without doubt, mental diseases spring<br>from physical ones. Similarly physical diseases spring from mental ones.<br>This is the truth. He that indulgeth in regrets on account of past<br>physical or mental woes, reapeth woe from woe and suffereth double woe.<br>Cold, heat, and wind,&#8212;these three are the attributes of the body.[41]<br>Their existence in harmony is the sign of health. If one of the three<br>prevails over the rest, remedies have been laid down. Cold is checked by<br>heat, and heat is checked by cold. Goodness, passion, and darkness are<br>the three attributes of the mind. The existence of these three in harmony<br>is the sign of (mental) health. If one of these prevails over the rest,<br>remedies have been prescribed. Grief is checked by joy, and joy is<br>checked by grief. One, living in the present enjoyment of this, wishes to<br>recollect his past woes. Another, living in the present suffering of woe,<br>wishes to recollect his past bliss. Thou, however, wert never sad in<br>grief or glad in bliss.[42] Thou, shouldst not, therefore, use thy memory<br>for becoming sad during times of bliss, or glad during times of woe. It<br>seems that Destiny is all-powerful. Or, if it be thy nature, in<br>consequence of which thou art thus afflicted, how is it that it does not<br>behove thee to recollect the sight thou sawest before, viz., the<br>scantily-clad Krishna dragged, while in her season, before the<br>assembly.[43] Why does it not behove thee to recollect our expulsion from<br>the (Kuru) city and our exile (into the woods) dressed in deerskins, as<br>also our living in the great forests? Why hast thou forgotten the woes<br>inflicted by Jatasura, the battle with Chitrasena, and the distress<br>suffered at the hands of the Sindhu king? Why hast thou forgotten the<br>kick received by the princess Draupadi from Kichaka white we were living<br>in concealment? A fierce battle, O chastiser of foes, like that which<br>thou hast fought with Bhishma and Drona is now before thee, to be fought<br>(however) with thy mind alone. In deed, that battle is now before thee in<br>which there is no need of arrows, of friends, of relatives and kinsmen,<br>but which will have to be fought with thy mind alone. If thou givest up<br>thy life-breath before conquering in this battle, then, assuming another<br>body, thou shalt have to fight these very foes again.[44] Therefore,<br>fight that battle this very day, O bull of Bharata's race, disregarding<br>the concerns of thy body, and aided by thy own acts, conquer and identify<br>with thy mind's foe.[45] If thou canst not win that battle, what wilt be<br>thy condition? On the other hand, by winning it, O monarch, thou shalt<br>have attained the great end of life. Applying thy intellect to this, and<br>ascertaining the right and the wrong paths of creatures, follow thou the<br>course adopted by thy sire before thee and govern properly thy kingdom.<br>By good luck, O king, the sinful Duryodhana hath been stain with all his<br>followers. By good luck, thou too hast attained to the condition of<br>Draupadi's locks.[46] Perform with due rites and profuse presents the<br>horse-sacrifice. We, are thy servants, O son of Pritha, as also Vasudeva<br>of great energy!'"
