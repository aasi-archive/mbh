                            "'Vasishtha said, Listen now to me as I discourse to thee on Buddhas<br>(Supreme Soul) and Abuddha (Jiva) which is the dispensation of attributes<br>of Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas. Assuming many forms (under the influence of<br>illusion) the Supreme Soul, becoming Jiva, regards all those forms as<br>real,[1631] In consequence of (his regarding himself identical with) such<br>transformations, Jiva fails to understand the Supreme Soul, for he bears<br>the attributes (of Sattwa and Rajas and Tamas) and creates and with-draws<br>into himself what he creates. Ceaselessly for his sport, O monarch, does<br>Jiva undergo modifications, and because he is capable of understanding<br>the action of the Unmanifest, therefore is he called Budhyamana (the<br>Comprehender).[1632] The Unmanifest or Prakriti can at no time comprehend<br>Brahma which is really without attributes even when it manifests itself<br>with attributes. Hence is Prakriti called Unintelligent. There is a<br>declaration of the Srutis to the effect that if ever Prakriti does<br>succeed in knowing the twenty-fifth (i.e., Jiva) Prakriti then (instead<br>of being something differentiated from Jiva) becomes identified with Jiva<br>who is united with her. (As regards, however, the Supreme Soul, which is<br>ever disunited and dissociated, and which transcends the twenty-fifth<br>Prakriti can never comprehend it). In consequence of this (viz., his<br>attachment to or union with Prakriti), Jiva or Purusha, who is not<br>manifest and which in his real nature is not subject to modifications,<br>comes to be called as the Unawakened or Ignorant. Indeed because the<br>twenty-fifth can comprehend the Unmanifest, he is therefore, called<br>Budhyamana (or Comprehender). He cannot, however, readily comprehend the<br>twenty-sixth, which is stainless, which is Knowledge without duality,<br>which is immeasurable, and which is eternal. The twenty-sixth, however,<br>can know both Jiva and Prakriti, numbering the twenty-fifth and the<br>twenty-fourth respectively. O thou of great effulgence, only men of<br>wisdom succeed in knowing that Brahma which is Unmanifest, which inheres<br>in its real nature to all that is seen and unseen, and which, O son is<br>the one independent essence in the universe.[1633] When Jiva considers<br>himself different from what he truly is (i.e. when he regards himself as<br>fat or lean, fair or dark a Brahmana or a Sudra), it is only then that he<br>fails to know the Supreme Soul and himself and Prakriti with which he is<br>united. When Jiva succeeds in understanding Prakriti (and knowing that<br>she is something different from him) then he is said to be restored to<br>his true nature and then does he attain to that high understanding which<br>is pure and stainless and which is concerned with Brahma. When Jiva<br>succeeds, O tiger among kings, in attaining to that excellent<br>understanding, he then attains to that Pure Knowledge (without duality)<br>which is called the twenty-sixth or (Brahma). He then casts off the<br>Unmanifest or Prakriti which is fraught with the attributes of Creation<br>and Destruction. When Jiva succeeds in knowing Prakriti which is<br>unintelligent and subject to the action of the three attributes of<br>Sattwa, and Rajas and Tamas, he then becomes destitute of attributes<br>himself. In consequence of his thus understanding the Unmanifest (to be<br>something different from him), he succeeds in acquiring the nature of the<br>Supreme Soul. The learned say that when he is freed from the attributes<br>of Sattwa and Rajas and Tamas and united in the nature with the Supreme<br>Soul then does Jiva become identified with that Soul. The Supreme Soul is<br>called Tattwa as well as Not-Tattwa, and transcends decay and<br>destruction.[1634] O giver of honours, the Soul, though it has the<br>manifest principles (viz. the body) for its resting place, yet it cannot<br>be said to have acquired the nature of those principles. The wise say<br>that including the Jiva soul there are five and twenty principles in all.<br>Indeed, O son, the Soul is not to be regarded as possessed of any of the<br>principles (Mahat and the rest). Endued with Intelligence, it transcends<br>the principles. It casts off quickly even that principle which is the<br>indication of the Knowing or awakened one.[1635] When Jiva comes to<br>regard himself as the twenty-sixth which is divested of decay and<br>destruction, it is then that, without doubt, he succeeds by his own force<br>in attaining to similarity with the twenty-sixth. Though awakened by the<br>twenty-sixth which is Pure Intelligence, Jiva still becomes subject to<br>Ignorance. This is the cause of Jiva, multifariousness (in respect of<br>forms) as explained in the Srutis and the Sankhya scriptures. When Jiva,<br>who is endued with Chetana and Unintelligent Prakriti, loses all<br>Consciousness of a distinct or individual Self, then does he, losing his<br>multifariousness, resumes his Oneness. O ruler of Mithila, when Jiva, who<br>is found to be in union with happiness and misery and who is seldom free<br>from the consciousness of Self, succeeds in attaining to a similarity<br>with the Supreme Soul which is beyond the reach of the understanding,<br>then does he becomes freed from virtue and vice. Indeed, when Jiva,<br>attaining to the twenty-sixth which is Unborn and Puissant and which is<br>dissociated from all attachments, succeeds in comprehending it<br>thoroughly, he himself becomes possessed of puissance and entirely casts<br>off the Unmanifest or Prakriti. In consequence of understanding the<br>twenty-sixth, the four and twenty principles seems to Jiva to be<br>unsubstantial or of no value. I have thus told thee, O sinless one,<br>according to the indication of the Srutis, the nature of the<br>Unintelligent or Prakriti, and of Jiva, so also of that which is Pure<br>Knowledge viz., the Supreme Soul, agreeable to the truth. Guided by the<br>scriptures, variety and oneness are thus to be understood. The difference<br>between the gnat and the Udumvara, or that between the fish and water,<br>illustrates the difference between the Jiva-soul and the Supreme<br>Soul.[1636] The Multiplicity and Oneness of these two are then understood<br>in this way. This is called Emancipation, viz., this comprehension or<br>knowledge of oneself as something distinct from Unintelligent or<br>Unmanifest Prakriti. The twenty-fifth, which resides in the bodies of<br>living creatures, should be emancipated by making him know the Unmanifest<br>or the Supreme Soul which transcends the understanding. Indeed, that<br>twenty-fifth is capable of attaining to Emancipation in this way only and<br>not through any other means, it is certain. Though really different from<br>the Kshetra in which he resides for the time being, he partakes of the<br>nature of that Kshetra in consequence of his union with it.[1637] Uniting<br>with what is Pure, he becomes Pure. Uniting with the Intelligent, he<br>becomes Intelligent. By uniting, O foremost of men, with one that is<br>Emancipate, he becomes Emancipated. By uniting with one that has been<br>freed from attachments of every kind, he becomes freed from all<br>attachments. By uniting with one striving after Emancipation, he himself,<br>partaking of the nature of his companion, strives after Emancipation. By<br>uniting with one of pure deeds he becomes pure and of pure deeds and<br>endued with blazing effulgence. By uniting with one of unstained soul, he<br>becomes of unstained soul himself. By uniting with the One independent<br>Soul, he becomes One and Independent. Uniting with One that is dependent<br>on One's own Self, he becomes of the same nature and attains to<br>Independence.<br><br>"'&#8212;O monarch, I have duly told thee all this that is perfectly true.<br>Candidly have I discoursed to thee on this subject, viz., the Eternal and<br>Stainless and Primeval Brahma. Thou mayst impart this high knowledge,<br>capable of awakening the soul, unto that person, O king, who though not<br>conversant with the Vedas is nevertheless, humble and has a keen desire<br>for acquiring the knowledge of Brahma. It should never be imparted unto<br>one that is wedded to falsehood, or one that is cunning or roguish, or<br>one that is without any strength of mind or one that is of crooked<br>understanding, or one that is jealous of men of knowledge, or one that<br>gives pain to others. Listen to me as I say who they are unto whom this<br>knowledge may safely be communicated. It should be given to one that is<br>endued with faith, or one that is possessed of merit, or one that always<br>abstains from speaking ill of others, or one that is devoted to penances<br>from the purest of motives, or one that is endued with knowledge and<br>wisdom, or one that is conversant of the sacrifices and other rites laid<br>down in the Vedas, or one that is possessed of a forgiving disposition,<br>or one that is inclined to take compassion on and do good to all<br>creatures; or one that is fond of dwelling in privacy and solitude, or<br>one that is fond of discharging all acts laid down in the scriptures, or<br>one that is averse to quarrels and disputes, or one that is possessed of<br>great learning or one endued with wisdom or one possessed of forgiveness<br>and self-restraint and tranquillity of soul. This high knowledge of<br>Brahma should never be communicated to one that is not possessed of such<br>qualifications. It has been said that by imparting this knowledge to one<br>that cannot be regarded as fit receptacle for holding it no advantage or<br>good fruit can arise. Unto one that is not observant of any vows and<br>restraints, this high knowledge should never be communicated even if he<br>gives in exchange the whole Earth full of gems and wealth of every kind.<br>Without doubt, however, O king, this knowledge should be given to one<br>that has conquered one's senses. O Karala, let no fear be thine any<br>longer, since thou halt heard all this regarding high Brahma from me<br>today! I have discoursed to thee duly about high and holy Brahma that is<br>without beginning and middle (and end) and that is capable of dispelling<br>all kinds of grief. Beholding Brahma whose sight is capable of dispelling<br>both birth and death, O king which is full of auspiciousness, which<br>removes all fear, and which benefit, and having acquired this essence of<br>all knowledge, cast off all error and stupefaction today! I had acquired<br>this knowledge from the eternal Hiranyagarbha himself, O king, who<br>communicated it to me for my having carefully gratified that great Being<br>of every superior Soul. Asked by thee today, I have, O monarch,<br>communicated the knowledge of eternal Brahma to the just as I had myself<br>acquired it from my teacher. Indeed, this high knowledge that is the<br>refuge of all persons conversant with Emancipation has been imparted to<br>thee exactly as I had it from Brahman himself!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, I have thus told thee of high Brahma agreeably to<br>what the great Rishi (Vasishtha) had said (unto king Karala of Janaka's<br>race), by attaining to which the Twenty-fifth (or Jiva) has never to<br>return. Jiva, in consequence of his not knowing truly the Supreme Soul<br>which is not subject to decay and death, is obliged to frequently come<br>back into the world. When, however, Jiva succeeds in acquiring that high<br>knowledge, he has no longer to come back. Having heard it, O king from<br>the celestial Rishi, I have, O son, communicated to thee high knowledge<br>productive of the highest good. This knowledge was obtained from<br>Hiranyagarbha by the high-souled Rishi Vasishtha. From that foremost of<br>Rishis, viz., Vasishtha, it was acquired by Narada. From Narada I have<br>acquired that knowledge which is truly identifiable with the eternal<br>Brahma. Having heard this discourse of high import, fraught with<br>excellent words, do not, O foremost of the Kurus, yield any longer to<br>grief. That man who knows Kshara and Akshara becomes freed from fear. He,<br>indeed, O king, is obliged to cherish fear who is destitute of this<br>knowledge. In consequence of Ignorance (of Brahma), the man of foolish<br>soul hath repeatedly to come back into this world. Indeed, departing from<br>this life, he has to be born in thousands and thousands of orders of<br>Being every one of which hath death in the end. Now in the world of the<br>deities, now among men, and now among intermediate orders of Being, he<br>has to appear again and again. If in course of time he succeeds in<br>crossing that Ocean of Ignorance in which he is sunk, he then succeeds in<br>avoiding rebirth altogether and attaining to identity with the Supreme<br>Soul. The Ocean of Ignorance is terrible. It is bottomless and called the<br>Unmanifest. O Bharata, day after day, creatures are seen to fall and sink<br>in that Ocean. Since thou, O king, hast been freed from that eternal and<br>limitless Ocean of Ignorance, thou, hast, therefore become freed from<br>Rajas and also Tamas.'"
