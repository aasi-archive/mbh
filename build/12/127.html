                            "Bhishma said, 'Then that best of Rishis, viz., the regenerate Rishabha,<br>sitting in the midst of all those Rishis, smiled a little and said these<br>words: 'Formerly, O tiger among kings, while travelling among sacred<br>places, I arrived, O lord, at the beautiful asylum of Nara and Narayana.<br>There lies the delightful spot called Vadri, and there also is that lake<br>in the firmament (whence the sacred Ganga takes her rise).[381] There the<br>sage Aswasiras, O king, (always) reads the eternal Vedas. Having<br>performed my ablutions in that lake and offered with due rites oblations<br>of water unto the Pitris and the dogs, I entered the asylum. Within that<br>retreat the Rishis Nara and Narayana always pass their time in true<br>pleasure.[382] Not far from that spot I repaired to another retreat for<br>taking up my abode. While seated there I beheld a very tall and emaciated<br>Rishi, clad in rags and skins, approaching towards me. Possessed of the<br>wealth of penances, he was named Tanu. Compared, O mighty-armed one, with<br>other men, his height seemed to be eight times greater. As regards his<br>leanness, O royal sage, I can say that I have never beheld its like. His<br>body, O king, was as thin as one's little finger. His neck and arms and<br>legs and hair were all of extra-ordinary aspect. His head was<br>proportionate to his body, and his cars and eyes also were the same. His<br>speech, O best of kings, and his movements were exceedingly feeble.<br>Beholding that exceedingly emaciated Brahmana I became very cheerless and<br>frightened. Saluting his feet, I stood before him with joined hands.<br>Having informed him of my name and family, and having told him also the<br>name of my father, O bull among men, I slowly sat myself down on a seat<br>that was indicated by him. Then, O monarch, that foremost of virtuous<br>men, viz., Tanu, began to discourse in the midst of the Rishis dwelling<br>in that asylum upon topics connected with Righteousness and Profit. While<br>engaged in discourse, a king, possessed of eyes like lotus petals and<br>accompanied by his forces and the ladies of his household, came to that<br>spot on a car drawn by fleet steeds. The name of that king was<br>Viradyumna. Of handsome features, he was possessed of great fame. His<br>son's name was Bhuridyumna. The child had been missing, and the sire,<br>exceedingly cheerless, came there in course of his wanderings amid the<br>forest in pursuit of the missing one. 'I shall find my son here!' 'I<br>shall find my son here!' Dragged on by hope in this way, the king<br>wandered through that forest in those days. Addressing the emaciated<br>Rishi he said, 'Without doubt that highly virtuous son of mine is<br>exceedingly difficult to be traced by me. Alas he was my only child. He<br>is lost and can nowhere be found! Though incapable of being found out, my<br>hope, however, of finding him is very great. Filled with that hope (which<br>is being constantly disappointed), I am verily on the point of death.'<br>Hearing these words of the king, that foremost of Munis, viz., the holy<br>Tanu, remained for a short while with head hanging down and himself<br>buried in contemplation. Beholding him buried in contemplation, the king<br>became exceedingly cheerless. In great grief he began to say slowly and<br>softly, 'What, O celestial Rishi, is unconquerable and what is greater<br>than hope? O holy one, tell me this if I may hear it without impropriety.'<br><br>"The Muni said, 'A holy and great Rishi had been insulted by thy son. He<br>had done it through ill-luck, moved by his foolish understanding. The<br>Rishi had asked thy son for a golden jar and vegetable barks. Thy son<br>contemptuously refused to gratify the ascetic. Thus treated by thy son,<br>the great sage became disappointed. Thus addressed, the king worshipped<br>that ascetic who was worshipped by all the world. Of virtuous soul,<br>Viradyumna sat there, spent with fatigue even as thou, O best of men, now<br>art. The great Rishi, in return, offered the king according to the rites<br>observed by the dwellers of the forests water to wash his feet and the<br>usual ingredients that make up the Arghya. Then all the Rishis, O tiger<br>among kings, sat there, surrounding that bull among men like the stars of<br>the constellation of Ursa Major surrounding the Pole star. And they asked<br>the unvanquished king as to the cause of his arrival at that asylum.'"
