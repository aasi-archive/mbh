                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast already explained to me, O grandsire, how<br>the religion of Yoga, which leads to the six well-known attributes, may<br>be adopted and practised without injuring any creature. Tell me, O<br>grandsire, of that religion which leads to both results, viz., Enjoyment<br>and Emancipation. Amongst these two, viz., the duties of domesticity and<br>those of Yoga, both of which lead to the same end, which is superior?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Both courses of duty are highly blessed. Both are<br>extremely difficult of accomplishment. Both are productive of high<br>fruits. Both are practised by those that are admittedly good. I shall<br>presently discourse to thee on the authoritativeness of both those<br>courses of duty, for dispelling thy doubts about their true import.<br>Listen to me with concentrated attention. In this connection is instanced<br>the old narrative of the discourse between Kapila and the cow. Listen to<br>it, O Yudhishthira![1225] It has been heard by us that in days of old<br>when the deity Tvashtri came to the place of king Nahusha, the latter,<br>for discharging the duties of hospitality, was on the point of killing a<br>cow agreeably to the true, ancient, and eternal injunction of the Vedas.<br>Beholding that cow tied for slaughter, Kapila of liberal soul, ever<br>observant of the duties of Sattwa, always engaged in restraining his<br>senses, possessed of true knowledge, and abstemious in diet, having<br>acquired an excellent understanding that was characterised by faith,<br>perfectly fearless, beneficial, firm, and ever directed towards truth,<br>uttered this word once, viz.,&#8212;'Alas ye Vedas!'&#8212;At that time a Rishi, of<br>the name of Syumarasmi, entering (by Yoga power) the form of that cow,<br>addressed the Yati Kapila, saying, 'Hist O Kapila! If the Vedas be<br>deserving (in consequence of those declarations in them that sanction the<br>slaughter of living creatures), whence have those other duties (fraught<br>with entire harmlessness to all creatures) come to be regarded as<br>authoritative?[1226] Men devoted to penances and endued with<br>intelligence, and who have the Srutis and knowledge for their eyes,<br>regard the injunctions of the Vedas, which have been declared through and<br>compiled by the Rishis, to be the words of God himself.[1227] What can<br>anybody say (by way of censure or praise) with respect to the contents of<br>the Vedas when these happen to be the words of the Supreme Being himself<br>who is freed from desire of fruit, who is without the fever (of envy and<br>aversion), who is addicted to nothing, and who is destitute of all<br>exertion (in consequence of the immediate fruition of all his wishes)?'<br><br>"Kapila said, 'I do not censure the Vedas. I do not wish to say anything<br>in derogation of them. It hath been heard by us that the different<br>courses of duty laid down for the different modes of life, all lead to<br>the same end. The Sannyasin attains to a high end. The forest-recluse<br>also attains to a high end. Both the other two also, viz., the<br>householder and the Brahmacharin, reach the same end. All the four modes<br>of life have always been regarded as Deva-yana ways. The relative<br>strength or weakness of these, as represented by their relative<br>superiority or inferiority, hath been declared in the character of their<br>respective ends.[1228]&#8212;Knowing these, accomplish acts which lead to<br>heaven and other blessings,&#8212;this is a Vedic declaration.&#8212;Do not<br>accomplish acts,&#8212;this also is another binding declaration of the Vedas.<br>If abstention from acts be meritorious, then their accomplishment must be<br>exceedingly reprehensible. When the scriptures stand thus, the strength<br>or weakness of particular declarations must be very difficult to<br>ascertain. If thou knowest of any course of duty which is superior to the<br>religion of harmlessness, and which depends upon direct evidence instead<br>of that of the scriptures, do thou then discourse to me upon it.'<br><br>"Syumarasmi said, 'One should perform sacrifice from desire of<br>heaven,&#8212;this Sruti is constantly heard by us. Thinking first of the<br>fruit (that is to be attained), one makes preparations for sacrifice.<br>Goat, horse, cow, all species of birds, domestic or wild, and herbs and<br>plants, are food of (other) living creatures. This is heard by us.[1229]<br>Food again has been directed to be taken day after day morning and<br>evening. Then again the Sruti declares that animals and grain are the<br>limbs of Sacrifice.[1230] The Lord of the universe created them along<br>with Sacrifice. The puissant Lord of all creatures caused the deities to<br>perform sacrifices with their aid. Altogether seven (domestic) and seven<br>(wild) animals are indicated as fit for sacrifice. Instead of all being<br>equally fit, each succeeding one is inferior to each preceding one. The<br>Vedas again declare that the whole universe is appointed for sacrifice.<br>Him also that is called Purusha the Vedas have appointed for the same<br>purpose.[1231] This again hath been sanctioned by men of remote and<br>remoter times. What man of learning is there that does not select,<br>according to his own ability, individuals from among living creatures for<br>sacrifice?[1232] The inferior animals, human beings, trees, and herbs,<br>all wish for the attainment of heaven. There is no means, however, except<br>sacrifice, by which they can obtain the fruition of that desire. The<br>deciduous herbs, animals, trees, creepers, clarified butter, milk, curds,<br>meat and other approved things (that are poured on the sacrificial fire),<br>land, the points of the compass, faith, and time which brings up the tale<br>of twelve, the Richs, the Yajuses, the Samans, and the sacrificer himself<br>bringing up the tale to sixteen, and Fire which should be known as the<br>householder,&#8212;these seventeen are said to be the limbs of sacrifice.<br>Sacrifice, the Sruti declares, is the root of the world and its course.<br>With clarified butter, milk, curds, dung, curds mixed with milk, skin,<br>the hair in her tail, horns, and hoofs, the cow alone is able to furnish<br>all the necessaries of sacrifice. Particular ones amongst these that are<br>laid down for particular sacrifices, coupled with Ritwijas and presents<br>(to the priests themselves and other Brahmanas) together sustain<br>sacrifices.[1233] By collecting these things together, people accomplish<br>sacrifices[1234]. This Sruti, consistent with the truth, is heard that<br>all things have been created for the performance of sacrifice. It was<br>thus that all men of ancient time set themselves to the performance of<br>sacrifices. As regards that person, however, who performs sacrifices<br>because of the conviction that sacrifices should be performed and not for<br>the sake of fruit or reward, it is seen that he does not injure any<br>creature or bear himself with hostility to anything, or set himself to<br>the accomplishment of any worldly task.[1235] Those things that have been<br>named as the limbs of sacrifice, and those other things that have been<br>mentioned as required in sacrifices and that are indicated in the<br>ordinances, all uphold one another (for the completion of sacrifices)<br>when used according to the approved ritual.[1236] I behold also the<br>Smritis compiled by he Rishis, into which the Vedas have been introduced.<br>Men of learning regard them as authoritative in consequence of their<br>following the Brahmanas.[1237] Sacrifices have the Brahmanas for that<br>progenitor, and truly they rest upon the Brahmanas. The whole universe<br>rests upon sacrifice, and sacrifice rests upon the universe.[1238] The<br>syllable Om is the root from which the Vedas have sprung. (Every rite,<br>therefore, should commence with the utterance of that syllable of vast<br>import). Of him who has uttered for him the syllables Om, Namas, Swaha,<br>Svadha, and Vashat, and who has, according to the extent of his ability,<br>performed sacrifices and other rites, there is no fear in respect of next<br>life in all the three worlds. Thus say the Vedas, and sages crowned with<br>ascetic success, and the foremost of Rishis. He in whom are the Richs,<br>the Yajuses, the Samans, and the expletives necessary for completing the<br>rhythm of the Samans according to the rules laid down in Vedic grammars,<br>is, indeed, a Brahmana.[1239] Thou knowest, O adorable Brahmana, what the<br>fruits are of Agnihotra, of the Soma-sacrifice, and of the other great<br>sacrifices. I say, for this reason, one should sacrifice and assist at<br>other people's sacrifices, without scruples of any kind. One who performs<br>such sacrifices as lead to heaven (such as Jyotishtoma, etc.) obtains<br>high rewards hereafter in the form of heavenly beatitude. This is<br>certain, viz., that they who do not perform sacrifices have neither this<br>world nor the next. They who are really conversant with the declarations<br>of the Vedas regard both kinds of declarations (viz., those that incite<br>to acts and those that preach abstention) as equally authoritative.'"
