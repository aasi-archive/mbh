                            "Bhishma said. 'The son of Satyavati having obtained this high boon from<br>the great God, was one day employed in rubbing his sticks for making a<br>fire. While thus engaged, the illustrious Rishi, O king, beheld the<br>Apsara Ghritachi, who, in consequence of her energy, was then possessed<br>of great beauty. Beholding the Apsara in those woods, the illustrious<br>Rishi Vyasa, O Yudhishthira, became suddenly smitten with desire. The<br>Apsara (Ghritachi), seeing the Rishi's heart troubled by desire,<br>transformed herself into a she-parrot and came to that spot. Although he<br>beheld the Apsara disguised in another form, the desire that had arisen<br>in the Rishi's heart (without disappearing) spread itself over every part<br>of his body. Summoning all his patience, the ascetic endeavoured to<br>suppress that desire; with all his effort, however, Vyasa did not succeed<br>in controlling his agitated mind. In consequence of the inevitability of<br>what was to happen, the Rishi's heart was attracted by Ghritachi's fair<br>form. He set himself more earnestly to the task of making a fire for<br>suppressing his emotion, but in spite of all his efforts his vital seed<br>came out. That best of regenerate ones, however, O king, continued to rub<br>his stick without feeling any scruples for what had happened. From the<br>seed that fell, was born a son unto him, called Suka. In consequence of<br>his circumstance attending his birth, he came to be called by name of<br>Suka. Indeed, it was thus that great ascetic that foremost of Rishis and<br>highest of Yogins, took birth from the two sticks (his father had for<br>making fire). As in a sacrifice a blazing fire shed its effulgence all<br>around when libations of clarified butter are poured upon it, after the<br>same manner did Suka take his birth, blazing with effulgence in<br>consequence of his own energy. Assuming the excellent form and complexion<br>that were his sire, Suka, O son of Kuru, of cleansed Soul, shone like a<br>smokeless fire. The foremost of rivers, viz., Ganga. O king, coming to<br>the breast of Meru, in her own embodied form, bathed Suka (after his<br>birth) with her waters. There fell from the welkin, O son of Kuru, an<br>ascetic's stick and a dark deer-skin for the use, O monarch, of the<br>high-souled Suka. The Gandharvas sang repeatedly and the diverse tribes<br>of Apsaras danced; and celestial kettledrums of loud sound began to beat.<br>The Gandharva Viswavasu, and Tumvuru and Varada, and those other<br>Gandharvas called by the names of Haha, and Huhu, eulogised the birth of<br>Suka. There the regents of the world with Sakra at their head came, as<br>also the deities and the celestial and the regenerate Rishis. The<br>Wind-god poured showers of celestial flowers upon the spot. The entire<br>universe, mobile, and immobile, became, filled with joy. The high-souled<br>Mahadeva of great effulgence, accompanied by the Goddess, and moved by<br>affection, came there and soon after the birth of the Muni's son invested<br>him with the sacred-thread. Sakra, the chief of the gods, gave him, from<br>affection, a celestial Kamandalu of excellent form, and some celestial<br>robes. Swans and Satapatras and cranes by thousands, and many parrots and<br>Chasas, O Bharata, wheeled over his head. Endued with great splendour and<br>intelligence, Suka, having obtained his birth from the two sticks,<br>continued to live there, engaged the while in the attentive observance of<br>many vows and fasts. As soon as Suka was born, the Vedas with all their<br>mysteries and all their abstracts, came for dwelling in him, O king, even<br>as they dwell in his sire. For all that, Suka selected Vrihaspati, who<br>was conversant with all the Vedas together with their branches and<br>commentaries, for his preceptor, remembering the universal<br>practice.[1737] Having studied all the Vedas together with all their<br>mysteries and abstracts, as also all the histories and the science of<br>government, O puissant monarch, the great ascetic returned home, after<br>giving his preceptor the tuition fee. Adopting the vow of a Brahmacharin,<br>he then commenced to practise the austerest penances concentrating all<br>his attention thereon. In even his childhood, he became an object of<br>respect with the gods and Rishis for his knowledge and penances. The mind<br>of the great ascetic, O king, took no pleasure in the three modes of life<br>with the domestic among them, keeping in view, as he did, the religion of<br>Emancipation.'"
