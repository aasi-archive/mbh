                            "Yudhishthira said, 'All men speak of ourselves as highly fortunate. In<br>truth, however, there is no person more wretched than ourselves. Though<br>honoured by all the world, O best of the Kurus, and though we have been<br>born among men, O grandsire, having been begotten by the very gods, yet<br>when so much sorrow has been our lot, it seems, O reverend chief, that<br>birth alone in an embodied form is the cause of all sorrow. Alas, when<br>shall we adopt a life of Renunciation that is destructive of<br>sorrow?[1342] Sages of rigid vows freed from the seven and ten (i.e., the<br>five breaths, mind, understanding, and the ten organs of knowledge and<br>action), from the five faults of Yoga (viz., desire, wrath, covetousness,<br>fear, and sleep) that constitute the chief causes (for binding man to<br>repeated rounds of earthly life), and from the other eight, viz., the<br>five objects of the senses and the three attributes (of Sattwa, Rajas,<br>and Tamas), have never to incur rebirth. When, O scorcher of foes, shall<br>we succeed in abandoning sovereignty for adopting a life of renunciation?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Everything, O great monarch, hath an end. Everything hath<br>bounds assigned to it. Even rebirth, it is well-known, hath an end. In<br>this world there is nothing that is, immutable. Thou thinkest, O king,<br>that this (viz., the affluence with which thou art invested is a fault).<br>That it is not so is not true, in regard to our present topic of<br>disquisition. Ye, however, are conversant with virtue, and have<br>readiness. It is certain, therefore, that ye shall attain to the end of<br>your sorrow, (viz., Emancipation) in time.[1343] Jiva equipped with body,<br>O king, is not the author of his merits and demerits (or their fruits as<br>represented by happiness and misery). On the other hand, he becomes<br>enveloped by the Darkness (of Ignorance having attachment and aversion<br>for its essence) that is born of his merits and demerits.[1344] As the<br>wind impregnated with dust of antimony once again seizes the<br>efflorescence of realgar and (though itself destitute of colour) assumes<br>the hues of the substances which it has seized and tinges the different<br>points of the compass (which represent its own hueless progenitor, viz.,<br>space), after the same manner, Jiva, though himself colourless, assumes a<br>hue in consequence of being enveloped by Darkness and variegated by the<br>fruits of action, and travels from body to body (making his own stainless<br>and immutable progenitor appear as stained and changeful).[1345] When<br>Jiva succeeds in dispelling by means of Knowledge, the Darkness that<br>invests him in consequence of Ignorance, then Immutable Brahma becomes<br>displayed (in all His glory). The Sages say that reversion to Immutable<br>Brahma is incapable of being achieved by Acts. Thyself, others in the<br>world, and the deities too, should reverence them that have achieved<br>Emancipation. All the great Rishis never desist from culture of<br>Brahma.[1346] In this connection is cited that discourse which was sung<br>(by the preceptor of the Daityas) in days of old. Listen, O monarch, with<br>undivided attention to the course of conduct that was followed by the<br>Daitya Vritra after he became divested of all his prosperity. Depending<br>only upon his intelligence, he did not indulge in sorrow, in the midst of<br>his enemies, although he was deprived of sovereignty, O Bharata! Unto<br>Vritra, when in days of old he was reft of sovereignty, (his preceptor)<br>Usanas said, 'I hope, O Danava, that in consequence of thy defeat thou<br>dost not cherish any grief?'<br><br>"Vritra said, 'Without doubt, having understood, by the aid of truth and<br>penances, the advent and departure of all living creatures, I have ceased<br>to indulge in either grief or joy. Urged by Time creatures sink<br>helplessly in hell. Some again, the sages say, go to heaven. All these<br>pass their time in contentment. Passing their allotted periods in heaven<br>and hell, and with some portion of their merits and demerits unexhausted<br>(by enjoyment and suffering), they repeatedly take birth, impelled by<br>Time. Chained by the bonds of Desire, creatures pass through myriads of<br>intermediate life and fall helplessly into hell.[1347] I have seen that<br>creatures come and go even thus. The lesson inculcated in the Scriptures<br>is that one's acquisitions correspond with one's acts.[1348] Creatures<br>take birth as men or as intermediate animals or as gods and go to hell.<br>Having acted in lives, that are past in such a way as to deserve them,<br>all creatures, subject to the ordinances of the Destroyer, meet with<br>happiness and misery, the agreeable and the disagreeable. Having enjoyed<br>the measure of weal or woe that corresponds with their acts, creatures<br>always come back by the old path,[1349] which is measured by the measure<br>of acts.' Then the illustrious Usanas addressed the Asura Vritra who was<br>thus talking of the highest refuge of the creation, saying, 'O<br>intelligent Daitya, why, O child, dost thou utter such foolish<br>rhapsodies?'<br><br>"Vritra said, 'The severe penances which I underwent from greed of<br>victory are well-known to thee as also to other sages. Appropriating<br>diverse scents and diverse kinds of tastes that other creatures had for<br>enjoying, I swelled up with my own energy, afflicting the three worlds.<br>Decked with myriads of effulgent rays I used to rove through the skies<br>(on my celestial car), incapable of being defeated by any creature and<br>fearing none. I achieved great prosperity through my penances and lost it<br>again through my own acts. Relying on my fortitude, however, I do not<br>grieve for this change. Desirous (in days of yore) of fighting the great<br>Indra, the high-souled ruler of the heavens, I beheld in that battle the<br>illustrious Hari, the puissant Narayana.[1350] He who is called<br>Vaikuntha, Purusha, Ananta, Sukla, Vishnu, Sanatana, Munjakesa,<br>Harismasru, and the Grandsire of all creatures.[1351] Without doubt,<br>there is still a remnant (to be enjoyed by me) of the rewards attaching<br>to that penance represented by a sight of the great Hari. It is in<br>consequence of that unexhausted remnant that I have become desirous of<br>asking thee, O illustrious one, about the fruits of action![1352] Upon<br>which order (of men) hath been established high Brahma prosperity? In<br>what mariner, again, doth high prosperity fall off? From whom do<br>creatures spring and live? Through whom again do they act? What is that<br>high Fruit by attaining to which a creature succeeds in living eternally<br>as Brahma? By what Act or by what Knowledge can that fruit be achieved?<br>It behoveth thee, O learned Brahmana, to expound these to me.'<br><br>"Recapitulated by me, O lion among kings, listen with undivided<br>attention, O bull of men, with all thy brothers, to what the sage Usanas<br>then said after he had been thus addressed by that prince of Danavas.'"
