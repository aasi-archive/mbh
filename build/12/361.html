                            "Bhishma said, 'Having said these words unto his dear spouse, the chief<br>of the Nagas proceeded to that place where the Brahmana was sitting in<br>expectation of an interview with him. As he proceeded, he thought of the<br>Brahman and wandered as to what the business could be that had brought<br>him to the Naga city. Arrived at his presence, O chief of men, that<br>foremost of Nagas devoted by his nature to righteousness, addressed his<br>guest in sweet words, saying, O Brahmana do not yield to wrath. I address<br>thee in peace. Do not be angry. After whom hast thou come hither? What is<br>thy object? Coming to thee, I ask thee in affection, O regenerate one<br>whom dost thou adore in this retired spot on the banks of the Gomati!'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'Know that my name is Dharmaranya, and that I have<br>come hither for obtaining a sight of the Naga Padmanabha, O foremost of<br>all regenerate persons. With him I have some business. I have heard that<br>he is not at home and that, therefore, I am not now near his present<br>quarters. Like a Chataka waiting in expectation of the clouds, I am<br>waiting for him whom I regard as dear to me. For dispelling all evil from<br>him and bringing about what is beneficial to him, I am engaged in<br>reciting the Vedas till he comes and am in Yoga and passing my time<br>happily.'<br><br>"The Naga said, 'Verily, thy conduct is exceedingly good. Pious thou art<br>and devoted to the good of all righteous persons. O highly blessed<br>Brahmana, every praise is due to thee. Thou beholdest the Naga with eyes<br>of affection. I am that Naga, O learned Rishi, whom thou seekest. Do thou<br>command me, as thou wishest, in respect of what is agreeable to thee and<br>what I should do for thee. Having heard from my spouse that thou art<br>here, I have approached this spot, O regenerate one, for beholding thee.<br>When thou hast come hither, thou art certain to return hence with thy<br>object fulfilled. It behoveth thee, O foremost of regenerate persons, to<br>employ me to any task with all confidence. All of us have certainly been<br>purchased by thee with thy merits,[1939] since thou, disregarding what is<br>for thy own good, hast employed thy time in seeking the good of<br>ourselves.'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'O highly blessed Naga, I have come hither, moved by<br>the desire of obtaining a sight of thee. I have come here, ignorant as I<br>am with all things, for asking thee about something, O Naga, relying on<br>the Jiva-soul, I desire to attain to the Supreme Soul which is the end of<br>the Jiva-soul. I am neither attached to, nor dissociated from, the<br>world.[1940] Thou shinest with the effulgence of thy own merits covered<br>by pure fame,&#8212;with an effulgence that is as agreeable as that of the<br>moon. O thou that livest on air alone, do thou first answer a question<br>that I wish to put to thee. Afterwards I shall inform thee of the object<br>that has brought me hither!'"
