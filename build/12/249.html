                            "Vyasa said, 'The objects by which one is surrounded are created by the<br>understanding. The Soul, without being connected with them, stands aloof,<br>presiding over them. It is the understanding that creates all objects.<br>The three primary qualities are continually being transformed (for the<br>production of objects). The Kshetrajna or Soul, endued with puissance,<br>presides, over them all, without, however, mingling with them.[1057] The<br>objects which the understanding creates partake of its own nature.<br>Indeed, as the spider creates threads (which partakes of its own material<br>substance), the objects created by the understanding partake of the<br>nature of the understanding. Some maintain that the qualities, when<br>driven away by Yoga or knowledge, do not cease to exist. They say this<br>because when once gone, the indications only of their return are not<br>perceptible. (But that is no evidence of their actual destruction).<br>Others say that when dispelled by knowledge, they are at once destroyed<br>never to return.[1058] Reflecting upon these two opinions properly, one<br>should strive one's best according to the way one thinks proper. It is by<br>this way that one should attain to eminence and take refuge in one's own<br>Soul alone.[1059] The Soul is without beginning and without end.<br>Comprehending his Soul properly man should move and act, without giving<br>way to wrath, without indulging in joy, and always free from envy.<br>Cutting by this means the knot that is in one's heart, the knot whose<br>existence is due to the operation of the faculties of the understanding,<br>which is hard (to open or cut), but which nevertheless is capable of<br>being destroyed by knowledge, one should live happily, without giving way<br>to grief (for anything that happens), and with one's doubts dispelled.<br>Know that they who mingle in the affairs of this world are as distressed<br>in body and mind as persons ignorant of the art of swimming when they<br>slip from the land and fall into a large and deep river. The man of<br>learning, however, being conversant with the truth, is never distressed,<br>for he feels like one walking over solid land. Indeed, he who apprehends<br>his Soul to be such, viz., as presenting only the character of Chit which<br>has knowledge alone for its indication, is never distressed. Indeed, a<br>person, by thus comprehending the origin and end of all creatures, and by<br>thus apprehending their inequalities or distinctions, succeeds in<br>attaining to high felicity. This knowledge is the possession of a<br>Brahmana in especial by virtue of his birth. Knowledge of the Soul, and<br>felicity like that which has been adverted to, are each fully sufficient<br>to lead to emancipation.[1060] By acquiring such knowledge one really<br>becomes learned. What else is the indication of a person of knowledge?<br>Having acquired such knowledge, they that are wise among men regard<br>themselves crowned with success and become emancipated.[1061] Those<br>things that become sources of fear unto men destitute of knowledge do not<br>become sources of fear unto those that are endued with knowledge. There<br>is no end higher than the eternal end which is obtained by a person<br>possessed of knowledge. One beholds with aversion all earthly objects of<br>enjoyment which are, of course, fraught with faults of every kind.<br>Another, beholding others betake themselves with pleasure to such<br>objects, is filled with sorrow. As regards this matter, however, they<br>that are conversant with both objects, behold, viz., that which is<br>fictitious and that which is not so, never indulge in sorrow and are<br>truly happy.[1062] That which a man does without expectation of fruits<br>destroys his acts of a former life. The acts, however, of such a person<br>both of this and his previous life cannot lead to Emancipation. On the<br>other hand, such destruction of former acts and such acts of this life<br>cannot lead to what is disagreeable (viz., hell), even if the man of<br>wisdom engages in acts.'"[1063]
