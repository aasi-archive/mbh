                            "Manu said, 'Upon the appearance of the physical and mental sorrow, one<br>does not become able to practise yoga. It is advisable, therefore, for<br>one not to brood over such sorrow. The remedy for sorrow is abstention<br>from brooding over it. When sorrow is brooded over, it comes aggressively<br>and increases in violence. One should relieve mental sorrow by wisdom,<br>while physical sorrow should be cured by medicaments. Wisdom teaches<br>this. One should not, while under sorrow, behave like a child. The man of<br>wisdom should never cherish a desire for youth, beauty, length of life,<br>accumulation of wealth, health, and the companionship of those that are<br>dear, all of which are transitory. One should not grieve singly for a<br>sorrow that affects a whole community. Without grieving, one should, if<br>one sees an opportunity, seek to apply a remedy. Without doubt, the<br>measure of sorrow is much greater than that of happiness in life. To one<br>who is content with the objects of the senses, death that is disagreeable<br>comes in consequence of his stupefaction. That man who avoids both sorrow<br>and happiness succeeds verily in attaining to Brahma. Such persons, who<br>are possessed of wisdom, have never to grieve.[691] Worldly possessions<br>bring about sorrow. In protecting them thou canst not have any happiness.<br>They are again earned with misery. One should not therefore, regard their<br>loss.[692] Pure Knowledge (or Brahma) is regarded (by ignorance) as<br>existing in the diverse forms that are objects of Knowledge. Know that<br>mind is only an attribute of Knowledge. When the mind becomes united with<br>the faculties of knowledge, then the Understanding (which bodies forth<br>the forms of things) sets in.[693] When the Understanding, freed from the<br>attributes of action, becomes directed towards the mind (after being<br>withdrawn from outward objects), then does it succeed in knowing Brahma<br>by meditation or Yoga ending in complete absorption (samadhi)? The<br>Understanding flowing from Ignorance, and possessed of the senses and<br>attributes, runs towards external objects, like a river issuing from a<br>mountain summit and flowing towards other regions. When the<br>Understanding, withdrawn into the mind, succeeds in absorbing itself into<br>contemplation that is free from attributes, it attains to a knowledge of<br>Brahma like the touch of gold on a touchstone. The mind is the<br>apprehender of the objects of the senses. It must first be extinguished<br>(before Brahma can be attained). Dependent upon the attributes of objects<br>that are before it, the mind can never show that which is without<br>attributes. Shutting up all the doors constituted by the senses, the<br>Understanding should be withdrawn into the mind. In this state, when<br>absorbed in contemplation, it attains to the knowledge of Brahma. As the<br>fivefold great creatures (in their gross form) upon the destruction of<br>the attributes by which they are known, become withdrawn (into their<br>subtile form called Tanmatra), after the same manner the Understanding<br>may dwell in the mind alone, with the senses all withdrawn from their<br>objects. When the Understanding, though possessed of the attribute of<br>certainty, dwells in the mind, busied with the internal, even then it is<br>nothing but the mind (without being anything superior to it). When the<br>mind or consciousness, which attains to excellence through contemplation,<br>succeeds in identifying attributes with what are considered as their<br>possessors, then can it cast off all attributes and attain to Brahma<br>which is without attributes.[694] There is no indication that is fit<br>enough for yielding a knowledge of what is Unmanifest (Brahma). That<br>which cannot form the subject of language, cannot be acquired by any one.<br>With cleansed soul, one should seek to approach the Supreme Brahma,<br>through the aid afforded by penances, by inferences, by self-restraint,<br>by the practices and observances as laid down for one's own order, and by<br>the Vedas. Persons of clear vision (besides seeing the Supreme within<br>themselves), seek him in even external forms by freeing themselves from<br>attributes. The Supreme, which is called by the name of Jneya (i.e., that<br>which should be known), in consequence of the absence of all attributes<br>or of its own nature, can never be apprehended by argument. When the<br>Understanding becomes freed from attributes, then only it can attain to<br>Brahma. When unemancipated from attributes, it falls back from the<br>Supreme. Indeed, such is the nature of the understanding that it rushes<br>towards attributes and moves among them like fire among fuel. As in the<br>state called Sushupti (deep and dreamless slumber) the five senses exist<br>freed from their respective functions, after the same manner the Supreme<br>Brahma exists high above Prakriti, freed from all its attributes.<br>Embodied creatures thus betake themselves to action in consequence of<br>attributes. When they abstain therefrom, they attain to Emancipation.<br>Some again (by action) go to heaven. The living creature, primordial<br>nature, the understanding, the objects of the senses, the senses,<br>consciousness, conviction of personal identity, are called creatures (for<br>they are subjected to destruction). The original creation of all these<br>flowed from the Supreme. Their second or succeeding creation is due to<br>the action of couples or pairs (of opposite sexes) and is confined to all<br>things save the primal five, and is restrained by laws in consequence of<br>which the same species produce the same species. From righteousness<br>(living) creatures obtain a high end, and from sinfulness they earn an<br>end that is low. He who is unemancipated from attachments, encounters<br>rebirth; while he who is emancipated therefrom, attains to Knowledge (or<br>Brahma).'"
