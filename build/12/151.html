                            "Bhishma said, 'Thus addressed, Janamejaya replied unto the sage, saying,<br>'Thou rebukest one that deserves to be rebuked. Thou censurest one that<br>is deserving of censure. Thou upbraidest me and my acts. I implore thee<br>to be graceful towards me. All my acts have been sinful. I burn, however,<br>with repentance as if I am in the midst of blazing fire! My mind, in<br>remembrance of my deeds, is exceedingly cheerless. Verily, I am much<br>afraid of Yama. How can I bear to live without extracting that dart from<br>my heart? O Saunaka, suppressing all thy wrath, instruct me now. Formerly<br>I used to show regard for Brahmanas. I solemnly declare that I shall once<br>more show the same regard for thee. Let not my line be extinct. Let not<br>the race in which I am born sink into the dust. It is not proper that<br>they who have wronged Brahmanas and have for that, in consequence of the<br>injunctions of the Vedas, forfeited all claim to the respect of the world<br>and to social intercourse with their fellowmen, should have any bearer of<br>their names for continuing their races. I am overwhelmed with despair. I,<br>therefore, repeat my resolves (about mending my conduct). I pray you to<br>protect me like sages that do not accept gifts protecting the poor.<br>Sinful wights abstaining from sacrifices never attain to heaven.[439]<br>Leaving (this world), they have to pass their time in the pits of hell<br>like Pullindas and Khasas.[440] Ignorant that I am, give me wisdom like a<br>learned preceptor to his pupil or like a sire to his son. Be gratified<br>with me, O Saunaka!'<br><br>"Saunaka said, 'What wonder is there that a person destitute of wisdom<br>should do many improper acts? Knowing this, a. person of real wisdom is<br>never angry with creatures (when they become guilty of folly). By<br>ascending upon the top of wisdom's palace, one grieves for others, one's<br>own self being then too pure for becoming an object of other people's<br>grief. In consequence of one's wisdom one surveys all creatures in the<br>world like a person on a mountain-top surveying people below. The person<br>who becomes an object of censure with good men, who hates good men and<br>who hides himself from their view, never succeeds in obtaining any<br>blessing and never understands the propriety of acts. Thou knowest what<br>the energy and the nobility of the Brahmana is as laid down in the Vedas<br>and other scriptures. Act now in such a way that tranquillity of heart<br>may be thine and let Brahmanas be thy refuge, If the Brahmanas cease to<br>be angry with thee, that will ensure thy felicity in heaven. If, again,<br>thou repentest in sin, thy sight will be clear and thou wilt succeed in<br>beholding righteousness.'<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'I am repenting of my sins. I will never again seek to<br>extinguish virtue. I desire to obtain blessedness. Be thou gratified with<br>me.'<br><br>"Saunaka said, 'Dispelling arrogance and pride, O king, I wish thee to<br>show regard for me![441] Employ thyself in the good of all creatures,<br>ever remembering the mandates of righteousness. I am not reproving thee<br>from fear or narrowness of mind or covetousness. Listen now, with these<br>Brahmanas here, to the words of truth I utter. I do not ask for anything.<br>I shall, however, instruct thee in the ways of righteousness. All persons<br>will croak and bray and cry fie on me (for what I am going to do). They<br>will even call me sinful. My kinsmen and friends will discard me.[442]<br>Without doubt, however, my kinsmen and friends, hearing the words I<br>speak, will succeed in vigorously crossing the difficulties of life. Some<br>that are possessed of great wisdom will understand (my motives) rightly.<br>Know, O child, what my views are, O Bharata, in respect of the Brahmanas.<br>Do thou (after listening to me) act in such away that they may, through<br>my efforts, obtain every blessing. Do thou also, O king, pledge thy word<br>that thou wilt not again injure the Brahmanas.'<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'I swear, touching even thy feet, that I shall never<br>again, in thought, word, or deed, injure the Brahmanas.'"
