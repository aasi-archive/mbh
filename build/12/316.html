                            "'Yajnavalkya said, That which is without attributes, O son, can never be<br>explained by ascribing attributes to it. Listen, however, to me as I<br>expound to thee what is possessed of attributes and what is devoid of<br>them. High-souled Munis conversant with the truth regarding all the<br>topics or principles say that when Purusha seizes attributes like a<br>crystal catching the reflection of a red flower, he comes to be called as<br>possessed of attributes; but when freed from attributes like the crystal<br>freed from reflection, he comes to be viewed in his real nature, that is,<br>as beyond all attributes.[1651] Unmanifest Prakriti is by her nature<br>endued with attributes. She cannot transcend them. Destitute of<br>intelligence by nature, she becomes attached to attributes. Unmanifest<br>Prakriti cannot know anything, while Purusha, by his nature, is possessed<br>of knowledge,&#8212;There is nothing higher than myself,&#8212;even this is what<br>Purusha is always conscious of. For this reason the unmanifest (or<br>Prakriti), although naturally inanimate and unintelligent, still becomes<br>animate and intelligent in consequence of her union with Purusha who is<br>Eternal and Indestructible instead of remaining in her own nature due to<br>destructibility.[1652] When Purusha, through ignorance, repeatedly<br>becomes associated with attributes, he fails to understand his own real<br>nature and therefore he fails to attain to Emancipation. In consequence<br>Purusha's lordship over the principles that flow from Prakriti, he is<br>said to partake of the nature of those principles. In consequence also of<br>his agency in the matter of creation, he is said to possess the attribute<br>of creation. In consequence of his agency in the matter of Yoga, he is<br>said to possess the attribute of Yoga. For his lordship over those<br>particular principles known by the name of Prakriti, he is said to<br>possess the nature of Prakriti.[1653] For his agency in the matter of<br>creating the seeds (of all immobile objects), he is said to partake of<br>the nature of those seeds. And because he causes the several principles<br>or attributes to start into life, he is, therefore, said to be subject to<br>decay and destruction (for those principles themselves are subject<br>thereto). In consequence, again, of his being the witness of everything,<br>and in consequence also of there being nothing else than he, as also for<br>his consciousness of identity with Prakriti, Yatis crowned with ascetic<br>success, conversant with Adhyatma, and freed from fever of every kind,<br>regard him as existing by himself without a second, immutable, unmanifest<br>(in the form of Cause), unstable, and manifest (in the form of effects).<br>This is what has been heard by us. Those Sankhyas, however, that depend<br>upon Knowledge only (for their Emancipation) and the practice of<br>compassion for all creatures, say that it is Prakriti which is One but<br>Purushas are many.[1654] As a matter of fact, Purusha is different from<br>Prakriti which though unstable, still appears as stable. As a blade of<br>reed is different from its outer cover, even so is Purusha different from<br>Prakriti. Indeed, the worm that is ensconced within the Udumvara should<br>be known as different from the Udumvara. Though existing with the<br>Udumvara, the worm is not to be regarded as forming a portion of the<br>Udumvara. The fish is distinct from the water in which it lives, and the<br>water is distinct from the fish that lives in it. Though the fish and<br>water exist together, yet it is never drenched by water. The fire that is<br>contained in an earthen sauce pan is distinct from the earthen sauce pan,<br>and the sauce pan is distinct from the fire it contains. Although the<br>fire exists in and with the sauce pan, yet it is not to be regarded as<br>forming any part of it. The lotus-leaf that floats on a piece of water is<br>distinct from the piece of water on which it floats. Its co-existence<br>with water does not make it a portion of the water. The perennial<br>existence of those objects in and with those mentioned, is never<br>correctly understood by ordinary people. They who behold Prakriti and<br>Purusha in any other light are said to possess a vision that is<br>incorrect. It is certain that they have repeatedly to sink into terrible<br>hell. I have thus told thee the philosophy of the Sankhyas that excellent<br>science by which all things have been correctly ascertained. Ascertaining<br>the nature of Purusha and Prakriti in this way, the Sankhyas attain to<br>Emancipation. I have also told thee of the systems of those others that<br>are conversant with the great principles of the universe. I shall now<br>discourse to thee on the science of the Yogins.'"
