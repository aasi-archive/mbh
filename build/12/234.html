                            "Vyasa said, 'Thou hadst asked me about the Creation of all beings; I<br>have now narrated that to thee in full. Listen to me as I tell thee now<br>what the duties are of a Brahmana. The rituals of all ceremonies for<br>which sacrificial fees are enjoined, commencing with Jatakarma and ending<br>with Samavartana, depend for their performance upon a preceptor competent<br>in the Vedas.[894] Having studied all the Vedas and having displayed a<br>submissive behaviour towards his preceptor during his residence with him,<br>and having paid the preceptor's fee, the youth should return home with a<br>thorough knowledge of all sacrifices.[895] Receiving the permission of<br>his preceptor, he should adopt one of the four modes of life and live in<br>it in due observance of its duties till he casts off his body. He should<br>either lead a life of domesticity with spouses and engaged in creating<br>offspring, or live in the observance of Brahmacharya; or in the forest in<br>the company of his preceptor, or in the practice of the duties laid down<br>for a yati. A life of domesticity is said to be the root of all the other<br>modes of life. A self-restrained householder who has conquered all his<br>attachments to worldly objects always attains to success (in respect of<br>the great object of life). A Brahmana, by begetting children, by<br>acquiring a knowledge of the Vedas, and by performing sacrifices, pays<br>off the three debts he owes.[896] He should then enter the other modes of<br>life, having cleansed himself by his acts. He should settle in that place<br>which he may ascertain to be the most sacred spot on earth, and he should<br>strive in all matters that lead to fame, for attaining to a position of<br>eminence. The fame of Brahmanas increases through penances that are very<br>austere, through mastery of the various branches of knowledge, through<br>sacrifices, and through gifts. Indeed, a person enjoys endless regions of<br>the righteous (in the next world) as long as his deeds or the memory<br>thereof lasts in this world. A Brahmana should teach, study, officiate at<br>other people's sacrifices, and offer sacrifices himself. He should not<br>give away in vain or accept other people's gifts in vain. Wealth,<br>sufficient in quantity, that may come from one who is assisted in a<br>sacrifice, from a pupil, or from kinsmen (by marriage) of a daughter,<br>should be spent in the performance of sacrifice or in making gifts.<br>Wealth coming from any of these sources should never be enjoyed by a<br>Brahmana singly.[897] For a Brahmana leading a life of domesticity there<br>is no means save the acceptance of gifts for the sake of the deities, or<br>Rishis, or Pitris, or preceptor or the aged, or the diseased, or the<br>hungry.[898] Unto those that are persecuted by unseen foes, or those that<br>are striving to the best of their power to acquire knowledge, one should<br>make gifts from one's own possessions, including even cooked food, more<br>than one can fairly afford.[899] Unto a deserving person there is nothing<br>that cannot be given. They that are good and wise deserve to have even<br>the prince of steeds, called Uchchaisravas, belonging to Indra<br>himself.[900] Of high vows (king) Satyasandha, having, with due humility,<br>offered his own life-breaths for saving those of a Brahmana, ascended to<br>heaven. Sankriti's son Rantideva, having given only lukewarm water to the<br>high-souled Vasishtha, ascended to heaven and received high honours<br>there. Atri's royal son Indradamana, possessed of great intelligence,<br>having given diverse kinds of wealth to a deserving person, acquired<br>diverse regions of felicity in the next world. Usinara's son Sivi, having<br>given away his own limbs and the dear son of loins for the sake of a<br>Brahmana, ascended to heaven from this world. Pratardana, the ruler of<br>Kasi, having given away his very eyes to a Brahmana, obtained great fame<br>both here and hereafter. King Devavridha, having given away a very<br>beautiful and costly umbrella, with eight golden ribs, proceeded to<br>heaven with all the people of his kingdom. Sankriti of Atri's race,<br>possessed of great energy, having given instruction to his disciples on<br>the subject of Impersonal Brahma, proceeded to regions of great felicity.<br>Amvarisha of great prowess, heaving given unto the Brahmanas eleven<br>Arvudas of kine, proceeded to heaven with all the people of his kingdom.<br>Savitri, by giving away her ear-rings, and king Janamejaya, by giving<br>away his own body, both proceeded to high regions of felicity. Yuvanaswa,<br>the son of Vrishadarbha, by giving away diverse kinds of gems, a fine<br>mansion, and many beautiful women, ascended to heaven. Nimi, the ruler of<br>the Videhas, gave away his kingdom, Jamadagni's son (Rama) gave away the<br>whole earth; and Gaya gave away the earth with all her towns and cities,<br>unto the Brahmanas. Once when the clouds ceased to pour, Vasishtha,<br>resembling Brahman himself, kept alive all creatures like Prajapati<br>keeping them alive (by his energy and kindness). Karandhama's son Marutta<br>of cleansed soul, by giving away his daughter to Angiras, speedily<br>ascended to heaven. Brahmadatta, the ruler of the Panchalas, possessed of<br>superior intelligence, by giving away two precious jewels called Nidhi<br>and Sankha unto some of the foremost of the Brahmanas, obtained many<br>regions of felicity. King Mitrasaha, having given his own dear wife<br>Madayanti unto the high-souled Vasishtha, ascended to heaven with that<br>wife of his. The royal sage Sahasrajit, possessed of great fame having<br>cast off dear life itself for the sake of a Brahmana, ascended to regions<br>of great felicity. King Satadyumna, having given to Mudgala a mansion<br>made of gold and full of every object of comfort and use, ascended to<br>heaven. The king of the Salwas, known by the name of Dyutimat, possessed<br>of great prowess, gave unto Richika his entire kingdom and ascended to<br>heaven. The Royal sage Madiraswa, by giving away his daughter of slender<br>waist to Hiranyahasta, ascended to such regions as are held in esteem by<br>the very gods. The royal sage Lomapada, of great prowess, by giving away<br>his daughter Santa to Rishyasringa, obtained the fruition of all his<br>wishes. King Prasenajit, of great energy, by giving away a hundred<br>thousand kine with calves, ascended to excellent regions of felicity.<br>These and many others, possessed of great and well-ordered souls and<br>having their senses under control, ascended, by means Of gifts and<br>penances, to heaven. Their fame will last as long as the earth herself<br>will last. All of them have, by gifts, sacrifices and procreation of<br>issue, proceeded to heaven.'"
