                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Amongst the diverse kinds of sacrifices, all of<br>which, of course, are regarded to have but one object (viz., the<br>cleansing of the heart or the glory of God), tell me, O grandsire, what<br>that sacrifice is which has been ordained for the sake only of virtue and<br>not for the acquisition of either heaven or wealth!'[1283]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection I shall relate to thee the history,<br>formerly recited by Narada, of a Brahmana who for performing sacrifices,<br>lived according to the unchha mode.'<br><br>"Narada said, 'In one of the foremost of kingdoms that was distinguished<br>again for virtue, there lived a Brahmana. Devoted to penances and living<br>according to the unchha mode, that Brahmana was earnestly engaged in<br>adoring Vishnu in sacrifices.[1284] He had Syamaka for his food, as also<br>Suryaparni and Suvarchala and other kinds of potherbs that were bitter<br>and disagreeable to the taste. In consequence, however, of his penances,<br>all these tasted sweet.[1285] Abstaining from injuring any creature, and<br>leading the life of a forest recluse, he attained to ascetic success.<br>With roots and fruits, O scorcher of foes, he used to adore Vishnu in<br>sacrifices that were intended to confer heaven upon him.[1286] The<br>Brahmana, whose name was Satya, had a wife named Pushkaradharini. She was<br>pure-minded, and had emaciated herself by the observance of many austere<br>vows. (Herself having been of a benevolent disposition, and her husband<br>being thus addicted to sacrifices that were cruel), she did not approve<br>of the conduct of her lord. Summoned, however, to take her seat by his<br>side as his spouse (for the performance of a sacrifice), she feared to<br>incur his curse and, therefore, comforted herself with his conduct. The<br>garments that invested her body consisted of the (cast off) plumes of<br>peacocks. Although unwilling, she still performed that sacrifice at the<br>command of her lord who had become its Hotri. In that forest, near to the<br>Brahmana's asylum, lived a neighbour of his, viz., the virtuous Parnada<br>of Sukra's race, having assumed the form of a deer. He addressed that<br>Brahmana, whose name was Satya, in articulate speech and said unto him<br>these words, 'Thou wouldst be acting very improperly,[1287] if this<br>sacrifice of thine were accomplished in such a manner as to be defective<br>in mantras and other particulars of ritual. I, therefore, ask thee to<br>slay and cut me in pieces for making libations therewith on thy<br>sacrificial fire. Do this and becoming blameless ascend to heaven.' Then<br>the presiding goddess of the solar disc, viz., Savitri, came to that<br>sacrifice in her own embodied form and insisted upon that Brahmana in<br>doing what he desired by that deer to do. Unto that goddess, however, who<br>thus insisted, the Brahmana replied, saying, 'I shall not slay this deer<br>who lives with me in this same neighbourhood.'[1288] Thus addressed by<br>the Brahmana, the goddess Savitri desisted and entered the sacrificial<br>fire from desire of surveying the nether world, and wishing to avoid the<br>sight of (other) defects in that sacrifice.[1289] The deer, then, with<br>joined hands, once more begged of Satya (to be cut in pieces and poured<br>into the sacrificial fire). Satya, however, embraced him in friendship<br>and dismissed him, saying, 'Go!'[1290] At this, the deer seemed to leave<br>that place. But after he had gone eight steps he returned, and said,<br>'Verily, do thou slay me. Truly do I say, slain by thee I am sure to<br>attain to a righteous end. I give thee (spiritual) vision. Behold the<br>celestial Apsaras and the beautiful vehicles of the high-souled<br>Gandharvas.' Beholding (that sight) for a protracted space of time, with<br>longing eyes, and seeing the deer (solicitous of sacrifice), and thinking<br>that residence in heaven is attainable by only slaughter, he approved (of<br>the counsels the deer had given). It was Dharma himself who had become a<br>deer that lived in those woods for many years. (Seeing the Brahmana<br>tempted by the prospect he beheld), Dharma provided for his salvation and<br>counselled him, saying, 'This (viz., slaughter of living creatures) is<br>not conformable to the ordinances about Sacrifices.[1291] The penances,<br>which had been of very large measure, of that Brahmana whose mind had<br>entertained the desire of slaying the deer, diminished greatly in<br>consequence of that thought itself. The injuring of living creatures,<br>therefore, forms no part of sacrifice.[1292] Then the illustrious Dharma<br>(having assumed his real form), himself assisted that Brahmana, by<br>discharging the priestly office, to perform a sacrifice. The Brahmana,<br>after this, in consequence of his (renewed) penances, attained to that<br>state of mind which was his spouse's.[1293] Abstention from injury is<br>that religion which is complete in respect of its rewards. The religion,<br>however, of cruelty is only thus far beneficial that it leads to heaven<br>(which has a termination). I have spoken to thee of that religion of<br>Truth which, indeed, is the religion of those that are utterers of<br>Brahma.'"[1294]
