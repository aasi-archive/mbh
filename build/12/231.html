                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I desire, O thou of Kuru's race, to know what the<br>origin and what the end is of all creatures; what is the nature of their<br>meditation and what are their acts; what are the divisions of time, and<br>what the allotted periods of life in the respective epochs. I desire also<br>to know in full the truth about the genesis and the conduct of the world;<br>the origin of creatures into the world and the manner of their going on.<br>Indeed, whence their creation and destruction? O best of virtuous<br>persons, if thou art minded to favour us, do tell us this about which I<br>ask thee. Having heard before this excellent discourse of Bhrigu unto the<br>regenerate sage Bharadwaja which thou didst recite, my understanding,<br>purged of ignorance, has become exceedingly attached to yoga, and<br>withdrawn from worldly objects rests upon heavenly purity. I ask thee<br>about the subject, therefore, once more. It behoves thee to discourse to<br>me (more elaborately).'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection I shall recite to thee an old<br>narrative of what the divine Vyasa said unto his son Suka when the latter<br>had questioned the former. Having studied the illimitable Vedas with all<br>their branches and the Upanishads, and desirous of leading a life of<br>Brahmacharya in consequence of his having earned excellence of religious<br>merit, Suka addressed these very questions, about which his doubts had<br>been solved, to his father the island-born Rishi who had removed (by<br>study and contemplation) all doubts connected with the topic of the true<br>import of duties.'<br><br>"Suka said, 'It behoveth thee to tell me who the Creator is of all<br>beings, as fixed by a knowledge of time,[871] and what the duties are<br>that should be accomplished by a Brahmana.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Unto his son who had questioned him, the sire, having a<br>knowledge of both the past and future, conversant with all duties and<br>endued with omniscience, thus discoursed on the subject.'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'Only Brahma, which is without beginning and without end,<br>unborn, blazing with effulgence, above decay, immutable, indestructible,<br>inconceivable, and transcending knowledge, exists before the<br>Creation.[872] The Rishis, measuring time, have named particular portions<br>by particular names. Five and ten winks of the eye make what is called a<br>Kashtha. Thirty Kashthas would make what is called a Kala. Thirty Kalas,<br>with the tenth part of a Kala added, make what is known as a Muhurta.<br>Thirty Muhurtas make up one day and night. Thirty days and nights are<br>called a month, and twelve months are called a year. Persons conversant<br>with mathematical science say that a year is made up of two ayanas<br>(dependent on sun's motion), viz., the northern and the southern. The sun<br>makes the day and the night for the world of man. The night is for the<br>sleep of all living creatures, and the day is for the doing of action. A<br>month of human beings is equal to a day and night of the Pitris. That<br>division (as regards the Pitris) consists in this: the lighted fortnight<br>(of men) is their day which is for the doing of acts; and the dark<br>fortnight is their night for sleep. A year (of human beings) is equal to<br>a day and night of the gods. The division (as regards the gods) consists<br>in this: the half year for which the sun travels from the vernal to the<br>autumnal equinox is the day of the deities, and the half year for which<br>the sun travels from the latter to the former is their night. Computing<br>by the days and nights of human beings about which I have told thee, I<br>shall speak of the day and night of Brahman and his years also. I shall,<br>in their order, tell thee the number of years, that are (thus) for<br>different purposes computed differently in respect of the Krita, the<br>Treta, the Dwapara, and the Kali yugas. Four thousand years (of the<br>deities) is the duration of the first or Krita age. The morning of that<br>epoch consists of four hundred years and its evening is of four hundred<br>years. (The total duration, therefore, of the Krita yuga is four thousand<br>and eight hundred years of the deities). As regards the other yugas, the<br>duration of each gradually decreases by a quarter in respect of both the<br>substantive period with the conjoining portion and the conjoining portion<br>itself. (Thus the duration of the Treta is three thousand years and its<br>morning extends for three hundred years and its evening for three<br>hundred). The duration of the Dwapara also is two thousand years, and its<br>morning extends for two hundred years and its evening also for two<br>hundred. The duration of the Kali yuga is one thousand years, and its<br>morning extends for one hundred years, and its evening for one<br>hundred.[873] These periods always sustain the never-ending and eternal<br>worlds. They who are conversant with Brahma, O child, regard this as<br>Immutable Brahma. In the Krita age all the duties exists in their<br>entirety, along with Truth. No knowledge or object came to men of that<br>age through unrighteous or forbidden means.[874] In the other yugas,<br>duty, ordained in the Vedas, is seen to gradually decline by a quarter in<br>each. Sinfulness grows in consequence of theft, untruth, and deception.<br>In the Krita age, all persons are free from disease and crowned with<br>success in respect of all their objects, and all live for four hundred<br>years. In the Treta, the period of life decreases by a quarter. It has<br>also been heard by us that, in the succeeding yugas, the words of the<br>Vedas, the periods of life, the blessings (uttered by Brahmanas), and the<br>fruits of Vedic rites, all decrease gradually. The duties set down for<br>the Krita yuga are of one kind. Those for the Treta are otherwise. Those<br>for the Dwapara are different. And those for the Kali are otherwise. This<br>is in accordance with that decline that marks every succeeding yuga. In<br>the Krita, Penance occupies the foremost place. In the Treta, Knowledge<br>is foremost. In the Dwapara, Sacrifice has been said to be the foremost,<br>In the Kali yuga, only Gift is the one thing that has been laid down. The<br>learned say that these twelve thousand years (of the deities) constitute<br>what is called a yuga. A thousand such yugas compose a single day of<br>Brahman.[875] The same is the duration of Brahman's night. With the<br>commencement of Brahman's day the universe begins to start into life.<br>During the period of universal dissolution the Creator sleeps, having<br>recourse to yoga-meditation. When the period of slumber expires, He<br>awakes. That then which is Brahman's day extends for a thousand such<br>yugas. His nights also extends for a thousand similar yugas. They who<br>know this are said to know the day and the night. On the expiry of His<br>night, Brahman, waking up, modifies the indestructible chit by causing it<br>to be overlaid with Avidya. He then causes Consciousness to spring up,<br>whence proceeds Mind which is identical with the Manifest.'"[876]
