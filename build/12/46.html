                            "Janamejaya said, 'It behoveth thee, O learned Brahmana, to tell me what<br>was next done by Yudhishthira the mighty-armed son of Dharma after he had<br>regained his kingdom. It behoveth thee to tell me also, O Rishi, what the<br>heroic Hrishikesa, the supreme master of the three worlds did after this.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Listen to me, O king, as I narrate in detail, O<br>sinless one, what the Pandavas, headed by Vasudeva, did after this.<br>Having obtained his kingdom, O monarch, Kunti's son Yudhishthira<br>appointed each of the four orders of men to their respective duties. The<br>(eldest) son of Pandu gave unto a thousand high-souled Brahmanas of the<br>Snataka order a thousand Nishkas each. He then gratified the servants<br>that were dependant on him and the guests that came to him, including<br>persons that were undeserving and those that held heterodox views, by<br>fulfilling their wishes. Unto his priest Dhaumya he gave kine in<br>thousands and much wealth and gold and silver and robes of diverse kinds.<br>Towards Kripa, O monarch, the king behaved in the way one should towards<br>one's preceptor. Observant of vows, the king continued to honour Vidura<br>greatly. That foremost of charitable men gratified all persons with gifts<br>of food and drink and robes of diverse kinds and beds and seats. Having<br>restored peace to his kingdom, the king, O best of monarchs, possessed of<br>great fame, paid due honour unto Yuyutsu and Dhritarashtra. Placing his<br>kingdom, at the disposal of Dhritarashtra, of Gandhari, and of Vidura,<br>king Yudhishthira continued to pass his days happily. Having gratified<br>everybody, including the citizens, in this way, Yudhishthira, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, then proceeded with joined hands to the presence of the<br>high-souled Vasudeva. He beheld Krishna, of the hue of a blue cloud,<br>seated on a large sofa adorned with gold and gems. Attired in yellow<br>robes of silk and decked with celestial ornaments, his person blazed with<br>splendour like a Jewel set on gold. His bosom adorned with the Kaustubha<br>gem, he looked like the Udaya mountain that decked the rising Sun. So<br>beautiful did he look that there is no simile in the three worlds.<br>Approaching the high-souled one who was Vishnu himself in incarnate form,<br>king Yudhishthira addressed him sweetly and smilingly, saying, 'O<br>foremost of intelligent men, hast thou passed the night happily? O thou<br>of unfading glory, are all thy faculties in their full vigour? O foremost<br>of intelligent persons, is it all right with thy understanding? We have<br>got back our kingdom and the whole earth has come under our control, O<br>divine lord, through thy grace, O refuge of the three worlds and, O thou<br>of three steps,[134] through thy grace have we won victory and obtained<br>great fame and have not fallen away from the duties of our order!' Unto<br>that chastiser of foes, viz., king Yudhishthira the just who addressed<br>him in that strain the divine Krishna said not a word, for he was then<br>rapt in meditation."
