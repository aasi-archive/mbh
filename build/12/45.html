                            "Vaisampayana said, 'The king dismissed all his subjects, who, commanded<br>by the monarch, returned to their respective homes. Comforting his<br>brothers, Yudhishthira, blazing with beauty, then addressed his brothers<br>Bhima of terrible prowess and Arjuna and the twins, saying, 'Your bodies<br>have, in the great battle, been mangled with diverse kinds of weapons by<br>the foe. Ye are greatly fatigued, grief and anger have scorched your<br>hearts. Through my fault, ye bulls of Bharata's race, ye have suffered<br>the miseries of an exile in the forests like vulgar men. In delight and<br>in happy ease enjoy this victory (that ye have won). After resting<br>yourselves and regaining the full use of your faculties, meet me again in<br>the morning.' After this, the mighty-armed Vrikodara like Maghavat<br>entering his own beautiful fane, entered the palace of Duryodhana, that<br>was adorned with many excellent buildings and rooms, that adorned with<br>gems of diverse kinds, that teemed with servants, male and female, and<br>that Yudhishthira assigned to him with the approval of Dhritarashtra. The<br>mighty-armed Arjuna also, at the command of the king, obtained the palace<br>of Dussasana which was not inferior to Duryodhana's and which consisted<br>of many excellent structures and was adorned with a gate-way of gold, and<br>which abounded in wealth and was full of attendants of both sexes. The<br>palace of Durmarshana was even superior to that of Dussasana. Looking<br>like the mansion of Kuvera himself, it was adorned with gold and every<br>kind of gem. King Yudhishthira gladly gave it to Nakula who deserved it<br>best and who had been emaciated (with the miseries of a life) in the<br>great forest. The foremost of palaces belonging to Durmukha was<br>exceedingly beautiful and adorned with gold. It abounded in beds and<br>beautiful women, with eyes like lotus-petals. The king gave it unto<br>Sahadeva who was ever employed in doing what was agreeable to him.<br>Obtaining it, Sahadeva became delighted as the Lord of treasures upon<br>obtaining Kailasa. Yuyutsu and Vidura and Sanjaya, O monarch, and<br>Sudharman and Dhaumya, proceeded to the abodes they had owned<br>before.[133] Like a tiger entering his cave in the hills, that tiger<br>among men, viz., Saurin, accompanied by Satyaki, entered the palace of<br>Arjuna. Feasting on the viands and drinks (that had been kept ready for<br>them), the princes passed the night happily. Awaking in the morning with<br>well pleased hearts, they presented themselves before king Yudhishthira.'"
