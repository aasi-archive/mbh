                            Bhimasena said, "Thy understanding, O king, has become blind to the<br>truth, like that of a foolish and unintelligent reciter of the Veda in<br>consequence of his repeated recitation of those scriptures. If censuring<br>the duties of kings thou wouldst lead a life of idleness, then, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, this destruction of the Dhartarashtras was perfectly<br>uncalled for. Are forgiveness and compassion and pity and abstention from<br>injury not to be found in anybody walking along the path of Kshatriya<br>duties? If we Knew that this was thy intention, we would then have never<br>taken up arms and slain a single creature. We would then have lived by<br>mendicancy till the destruction of this body. This terrible battle<br>between the rulers of the earth would also have never taken place. The<br>learned have said this all that we see is food for the strong. Indeed,<br>this mobile and immobile world is our object of enjoyment for the person<br>that is strong. Wise men acquainted with Kshatriya duties have declared<br>that they who stand in the way of the person taking the sovereignty of<br>the earth, should be slain. Guilty of that fault, those that stood as<br>enemies of our kingdom have all been slain by us. Having slain them, O<br>Yudhishthira, righteously govern this earth. This our act (in refusing<br>the kingdom) is like that of a person who having dug a well stops in his<br>work before obtaining water and comes up smutted with mire. Or, this our<br>act is like that of a person who having climbed up a tall tree and taken<br>honey there from meets with death before tasting it. Or, it is like that<br>of a person who having set out on a long way comes back in despair<br>without having reached his destination. Or, it is like that of a person<br>who having slain all his foes, O thou of Kuru's race, at last Falls by<br>his own hand. Or, it is like that of a person afflicted with hunger, who<br>having obtained food, refuses to take it, or of a person under the<br>influence of desire, who having obtained a woman reciprocating his<br>passion, refuses to meet with her. We have become objects of censure, O<br>Bharata, because, O king, we follow thee that art of feeble<br>understanding, in consequence of thyself being our eldest brother. We are<br>possessed of mighty arms; we are accomplished in knowledge and endued<br>with great energy. Yet we are obedient to the words of a eunuch as if we<br>were entirely helpless. We are the refuge of all helpless persons. Yet,<br>when people see us so, why would they not say that in respect of the<br>acquisition of our objects we are entirely powerless? Reflect on this<br>that I say. It has been laid down that (a life of) renunciation should be<br>adopted, only in times of distress, by kings overcome with decrepitude or<br>defeated by foes. Men of wisdom, therefore, do not applaud renunciation<br>as the duty of a Kshatriya. On the other hand, they that are of clear<br>sight think that the adoption of that course of life (by a Kshatriya)<br>involves even the loss of virtue. How can those that have sprung from<br>that order, that are devoted to the practices of that order, and that<br>have refuge in them, censure those duties? Indeed, if those duties be<br>censurable, then why should not the Supreme Ordainer be censured?[15] It<br>is only those persons that are reft of prosperity and wealth and that are<br>infidels in faith, that have promulgated this precept of the Vedas (about<br>the propriety of a Kshatriya's adoption of a life of renunciation) as the<br>truth. In reality, however, it is never proper for a Kshatriya to do so.<br>He who is competent to support life by prowess, he who can support<br>himself by his own exertions, does not live, but really falls away from<br>his duty, by the hypocritical externals of a life of renunciation. That<br>man only is capable of leading a solitary life of happiness in the woods<br>who is unable to support sons and grandsons and the deities and Rishis<br>and guests and Pitris. As the deer and boars and birds (though they lead<br>a forest life) cannot attain to heaven, even so those Kshatriyas that are<br>not bereft of prowess yet not given to doing good turns cannot attain to<br>heaven by leading only a forest life. They should acquire religious merit<br>by other ways. If, O king, anybody were to obtain success from<br>renunciation, then mountains and trees would surely obtain it! These<br>latter are always seen to lead lives of renunciation. They do not injure<br>any one. They are, again, always aloof from a life of worldliness and are<br>all Brahmacharins. If it be the truth that a person's success depends<br>upon his own lot in life and not upon that of other, then (as a person<br>born in the Kshatriya order) thou shouldst betake thyself to action. He<br>that is reft of action can never have success. If they that fill only<br>their own stomachs could attain to success, then all aquatic creatures<br>would obtain it, for these have none else to support save their own<br>selves. Behold, the world moves on, with every creature on it employed in<br>acts proper to its nature. Therefore, one should betake oneself to<br>action. The man reft of action can never obtain success.'"
