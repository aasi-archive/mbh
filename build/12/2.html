                            "Vaisampayana said, 'That foremost of speakers, the sage Narada, thus<br>questioned, narrated everything about the manner in which he who was<br>believed to be a Suta's son had been cursed (in former days).'<br><br>"Narada said, 'It is even so, O mighty armed one, as thou sayest, O<br>Bharata! Nothing could resist Karna and Arjuna in battle. This, O sinless<br>one, that I am about to tell thee is unknown to the very gods. Listen to<br>me, O mighty-armed one, as it befell in former days. How all the<br>Kshatriyas, cleansed by weapons should attain to regions of bliss, was<br>the question. For this, a child was conceived by Kunti in her maidenhood,<br>capable of provoking a general war. Endued with great energy, that child<br>came to have the status of a Suta. He subsequently acquired the science<br>of weapons from the preceptor (Drona), that foremost descendant of<br>Angirasa's race. Thinking of the might of Bhimasena, the quickness of<br>Arjuna in the use of weapons, the intelligence of thyself, O king, the<br>humility of the twins, the friendship, from earliest years, between<br>Vasudeva and the wielder of Gandiva, and the affection of the people for<br>you all, that young man burnt with envy. In early age he made friends<br>with king Duryodhana, led by an accident and his own nature and the hate<br>he bore towards you all. Beholding that Dhananjaya was superior to every<br>one in the science of weapons, Karna. one day approached Drona in private<br>and said these words unto him, 'I desire to be acquainted with the Brahma<br>weapon, with all its mantras and the power of withdrawing it, for I<br>desire to fight Arjuna. Without doubt, the affection thou bearest to<br>every one of thy pupils is equal to what thou bearest to thy own son. I<br>pray that all the masters of the science of weapons may, through thy<br>grace, regard me as one accomplished in weapons!' Thus addressed by him,<br>Drona, from partiality for Phalguna, as also from his knowledge of the<br>wickedness of Karna, said, 'None but a Brahmana, who has duly observed<br>all vows, should be acquainted with the Brahma weapon, or a Kshatriya<br>that has practised austere penances, and no other.' When Drona had<br>answered thus, Karna, having worshipped him, obtained his leave, and<br>proceeded without delay to Rama then residing on the Mahendra mountains.<br>Approaching Rama, he bent his head unto him and said, 'I am a Brahmana of<br>Bhrigu's race.' This procured honour for him. With this knowledge about<br>his birth and family, Rama received him kindly and said, 'Thou art<br>welcome!' at which Karna became highly glad. While residing on the<br>Mahendra mountains that resembled heaven itself, Karna met and mixed with<br>many Gandharvas, Yakshas, and gods. Residing there he acquired all the<br>weapons duly, and became a great favourite of the gods, the Gandharvas,<br>and the Rakshasas. One day he roved on the sea-coast by the side of that<br>asylum. Indeed, Surya's son, armed with bow and sword, wandered alone,<br>While thus employed, O Partha, he inadvertently slew, without witting it,<br>the Homa cow of a certain utterer of Brahma who daily performed his<br>Agnihotra rite. Knowing that he had perpetrated that act from<br>inadvertence, he informed the Brahmana of it. Indeed Karna, for the<br>object of gratifying the owner, repeatedly said, 'O holy one, I have<br>killed this thy cow without wilting it. Forgive me the act!' Filled with<br>wrath, the Brahmana, rebuking him, said these words, 'O thou of wicked<br>conduct, thou deservest to be killed. Let the fruit of this act be thine,<br>O thou of wicked soul. While fighting him, O wretch whom thou always<br>challengest, and for whose sake thou strivest so much every day, the<br>earth shall swallow the wheel of thy car! And while the wheel of thy car<br>shall thus be swallowed up by the earth, thy foe, putting forth his<br>prowess, will cut off thy head, thyself being stupefied the while! Leave<br>me, O vile man! As thou hast heedlessly slain this my cow, even so wilt<br>thy foe cut off thy head while thou shalt be heedless!' Though cursed,<br>Karna still sought to gratify that foremost of Brahmanas by offering him<br>kine and wealth and gems. The latter, however, once more answered him,<br>'All the words will not succeed in falsifying the words spoken by me! Go<br>hence or remain, do whatever thou likest.' Thus addressed by the<br>Brahmana, Karna, hanging down his head from cheerlessness, returned<br>timidly to Rama, reflecting on that matter.'
