                            "Bhishma said, 'The yogin who wishes to always practise sinless<br>Brahmacharya and who is impressed with the faults attaching to dreams<br>should, with his whole heart, seek to abandon sleep. In dreams, the<br>embodied soul, affected by the attributes of Passion and Darkness, seems<br>to become possessed of another body and move and act influenced by<br>desire.[766] In consequence of application for the acquisition of<br>knowledge and of continued reflection and recapitulation, the yogin<br>remains always awake. Indeed, the yogin can keep himself continually<br>awake by devoting himself to knowledge. On this topic it has been asked<br>what is this state in which the embodied creature thinks himself<br>surrounded by and engaged in objects and acts? True it is that the<br>embodied being, with its senses really suspended, still thinks itself to<br>be possessed of body with all the senses of knowledge and of action. As<br>regards the question started, it is said that that master of yoga, named<br>Hari, comprehends truly how it happens. The great Rishis say that the<br>explanation offered by Hari is correct and consistent with reason. The<br>learned say that it is in consequence of the senses being worn out with<br>fatigue, dreams are experienced by all creatures. (Though the senses are<br>suspended) the mind, however, never disappears (or becomes inactive) and<br>hence arise dreams. This is said by all to be their noted cause. As the<br>imaginings of a person that is awake and engaged in acts, are due only to<br>the creative power of the mind, after the same manner the impressions in<br>a dream appertain only to the mind. A person with desire and attachment<br>obtains those imaginings (in dreams) based upon the impressions of<br>countless lives in the past. Nothing that impresses the mind once is ever<br>lost, and the Soul being cognisant of all those impressions causes them<br>to come forth from obscurity.[767] Whichever among the three attributes<br>of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness is brought about by the influence of<br>past acts and by whichever amongst them the mind is affected for the time<br>being in whatever way, the elements (in their subtile forms) display or<br>indicate accordingly (in the way of images).[768] After images have thus<br>been produced, the particular attribute of Goodness or Passion or<br>Darkness that may have been brought by past act rises in the mind and<br>conduces to its last result, viz., happiness or misery. Those images<br>having wind, bile, and phlegm for their chief causes, which men apprehend<br>through ignorance and in consequence of propensities fraught with Passion<br>and Darkness, cannot, it has been said, be easily discarded.[769]<br>Whatever objects again a person perceives in the mind (while wakeful)<br>through the senses in a state of perspicuity are apprehended by the mind<br>in dreams while the senses are obscured in respect of their<br>functions.[770] The Mind exists unobstructedly in all things. This is due<br>to the nature of the Soul. The Soul should be comprehended. All the<br>elements and the objects they compose exist in the Soul.[771] In the<br>state called dreamless slumber (sushupti), the manifest human body which,<br>of course, is the door of dreams, disappears in the mind. Occupying the<br>body the mind enters the soul which is manifest and upon which all<br>existent and non-existent things depend, and becomes transformed into a<br>wakeful witness with certainty of apprehension. Thus dwelling in pure<br>Consciousness which is the soul of all things; it is regarded by the<br>learned as transcending both Consciousness and all things in the<br>universe.[772] That yogin who in consequence of desire covets any of the<br>divine attributes (of Knowledge or Renunciation, etc.) should regard a<br>pure mind to be identical with the object of his desire. All things rest<br>in a pure mind or soul.[773] This is the result attained to by one who is<br>engaged in penances. That yogin, however, who has crossed Darkness or<br>ignorance, becomes possessed of transcending effulgence. When darkness or<br>ignorance has been transcended, the embodied Soul becomes Supreme Brahma,<br>the cause of the universe.[774] The deities have penances and Vedic<br>rites. Darkness (or pride and cruelty), which is destructive of the<br>former, has been adopted by the Asuras. This, viz., Brahma, which has<br>been said to have Knowledge only for its attribute, is difficult of<br>attainment by either the deities or the Asuras. It should be known that<br>the qualities of Goodness, Passion and Darkness belong to the deities and<br>the Asuras. Goodness is the attribute of the deities; while the two<br>others belong to the Asuras. Brahma transcends all those attributes. It<br>is pure Knowledge. It is Deathlessness. It is pure effulgence. It is<br>undeteriorating. Those persons of cleansed souls who know Brahma attain<br>to the highest end. One having knowledge for one's eye can say this much<br>with the aid of reason and analogy. Brahma which is indestructible can be<br>comprehended by only withdrawing the senses and the mind (from external<br>objects into the soul itself).'"[775]
