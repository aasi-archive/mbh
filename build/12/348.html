                            Janamejaya said, 'I have heard from thee the glory of the divine and<br>Supreme Soul. I have heard also of the birth of the Supreme Deity in the<br>house of Dharma, in the form of Nara and Narayana. I have also heard from<br>thee the origin of the Pinda from the mighty Baraha (Boar) (which form<br>the supreme Deity had assumed for raising by the submerged Earth). I have<br>heard from thee about those deities and Rishis that were ordained for the<br>religion of Pravritti and of those that were ordained for the religion of<br>Nivritti. Thou hast also, O regenerate one, discoursed to us on other<br>topics. Thou hast said also unto us of that vast form, with the Equine<br>head, of Vishnu, that partaker of the libations and other offerings made<br>in sacrifices,&#8212;.the form, viz., that appeared in the great ocean on the<br>North-East. That form was beheld by the illustrious Brahman, otherwise<br>known by the name of Parameshthi. What, however, were the exact features,<br>and what the energy, the like of which among all great objects, had never<br>appeared before, of that form which Hari, the upholder of the universe,<br>displayed on that occasion? What did Brahman do, O ascetic, after having<br>seen that foremost of deities, him whose likeness had never been seen<br>before, him who was of immeasurable energy, him who had the Equine head,<br>and him who was Sacredness itself? O regenerate one, this doubt hath<br>arisen in our mind about this ancient subject of knowledge. O thou of<br>foremost intelligence, for what reason did he supreme Deity assume that<br>form and display himself in it unto Brahman? Thou hast certainly<br>sanctified us by discoursing unto us on these diverse sacred<br>subjects!'[1895]<br><br>Sauti said, I shall recite to thee that ancient history, which is<br>perfectly consistent with the Vedas, and which the illustrious<br>Vaisampayana recited unto the son of Parikshit on the occasion of the<br>great Snake-sacrifice. Having heard the account of the mighty form of<br>Vishnu, equipt with the horse-head, the royal son of Parikshit too had<br>entertained the same doubt and put the same questions to Vaisampayana.<br><br>Janamejaya said, "Tell me, O best of men, for what reason did Hari appear<br>in that mighty form equipt with a horse-head and which Brahma, the<br>Creator, beheld on the shores of the great northern Ocean on the occasion<br>referred to by yourself?"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "All existent objects, O king, in this world, are the<br>result of a combination of the five primal elements, a combination due to<br>the intelligence of the Supreme Lord. The puissant Narayana, endued with<br>infinity, is the supreme Lord and Creator of the universe. He is the<br>inner Soul of all things, and the giver of boons. Divested of attributes,<br>he is again possessed of them. Listen now, O best of kings, to me as I<br>narrate to thee how the Destruction is brought about of all things. At<br>first, the element of Earth becomes merged in Water and nothing then is<br>seen save one vast expanse of Water on all sides. Water then merges into<br>Heat, and Heat into Wind. Wind then merges into Space, which in its turn,<br>merges into Mind. Mind merges into the Manifest (otherwise called<br>Consciousness or Ego). The Manifest merges into the Unmanifest (or<br>Prakriti). The Unmanifest (or Prakriti) merges into Purusha (Jivatman)<br>and Purusha merges into the Supreme Soul (or Brahman). Then Darkness<br>spreads over the face of the universe, and nothing can be perceived. From<br>that primal Darkness arises Brahma (endued with the principle of<br>Creation). Darkness is primeval and fraught with immortality. Brahma that<br>arises from primeval Darkness develops (by its own potency) into the idea<br>of the universe, and assumes the form of Purusha. Such Purusha is called<br>Aniruddha. Divested of sex, it is called otherwise by the name of<br>Pradhana (Supreme or Primary). That is also known by the name of<br>Manifest, or the combination of the triple attribute, O best of kings. He<br>exists with Knowledge alone for his companion. That illustrious and<br>puissant Being is otherwise called by the name of Viswaksena or Hari.<br>Yielding to Yoga-sleep, he lays himself down on the waters. He then<br>thinks of the Creation of the Universe of diversified phenomena and<br>fraught with immeasurable attributes. While engaged in thinking of<br>Creation, he recollects his own high attributes. From this springs the<br>four-faced Brahma representing the Consciousness of Anirudha. The<br>illustrious Brahma, otherwise called Hiranyagarbha, is the Grandsire of<br>all the worlds. Endued with eyes like lotus petals, he takes birth within<br>the Lotus that springs from (the navel of) Anirudha. Seated on that<br>Lotus, the illustrious, puissant, and eternal Brahma of wonderful aspect<br>saw that the waters were on all sides. Adopting the attribute of Sattwa<br>Brahma, otherwise called Parameshthi, then commenced to create the<br>universe. In the primeval Lotus that was endued with the effulgence of<br>the Sun, two drops of water had been cast by Narayana that were fraught<br>with great merit. The illustrious Narayana, without beginning and without<br>end, and transcending destruction, cast his eyes on those two drops of<br>water. One of those two drops of water, of very beautiful and bright<br>form, looked like a drop of honey. From that drop sprang, at the command<br>of Narayana, a Daitya of the name of Madhu made up of the attribute of<br>Tamas (Dullness). The other drop of water within the Lotus was very hard.<br>From it sprang the Daitya Kaitabha made up of the attribute of Rajas.<br>Endued thus with the attributes of Tamas and Rajas, the two Daityas<br>possessed of might and armed with maces, immediately after their birth,<br>began to rove within that vast primeval Lotus. They beheld within it<br>Brahma of immeasurable effulgence, engaged in creating the four Vedas,<br>each endued with the most delightful form. Those two foremost of Asuras,<br>possessed of bodies, beholding the four Vedas, suddenly seized them in<br>the very sight of their Creator. The two mighty Danavas, having seized<br>the eternal Vedas, quickly dived into the ocean of waters which they saw<br>and proceeded to its bottom. Seeing the Vedas forcibly taken away from<br>him, Brahma became filled with grief. Robbed of the Vedas in this way,<br>Brahma then addressed the Supreme Lord in these words.<br><br>"Brahma said, 'The Vedas are my great eyes. The Vedas are my great<br>strength. The Vedas are my great refuge. The Vedas are my high Brahman.<br>All the Vedas, however, have been forcibly taken away from me by the two<br>Danavas. Deprived of the Vedas, the worlds I have created have become<br>enveloped in darkness. Without the Vedas (beside me), how shall I succeed<br>in causing my excellent Creation to start into existence? Alas, great is<br>the grief I suffer in consequence of the loss of the Vedas (through such<br>agency). My heart is very much pained. It has become the abode of a great<br>sorrow. Who is there that will rescue me from this ocean of grief in<br>which I am sunk for the loss I have endured? Who is there that will bring<br>me the Vedas I have lost? Who is there that will take compassion on<br>me?&#8212;While Brahma was uttering these words, O best of kings, the<br>resolution suddenly arose in his mind, O foremost of intelligent persons,<br>for hymning the praises of Hari in these words. The puissant Brahma then,<br>with hands joined in reverence, and seizing the feet of his progenitor,<br>sang this highest of hymns in honour of Narayana.'"<br><br>"Brahma said, 'I bow to thee, O heart of Brahman. I bow to thee that hast<br>been born before me. Thou art the origin of the universe. Thou art the<br>foremost of all abodes. Thou, O puissant one, art the ocean of Yoga with<br>all its branches. Thou art the Creator of both what is Manifest and what<br>is Unmanifest. Thou treadest along the path whose auspiciousness is of<br>inconceivable extent. Thou art the consumer of the universe. Thou art the<br>Antaralock (Inner Soul) of all creatures. Thou art without any origin.<br>Thou art the refuge of the universe. Thou art self-born; for origin thou<br>hest none that is not thyself. As regards myself, I have sprung through<br>thy Grace. From thee have I derived my birth. My first birth from thee,<br>which is regarded sacred by all regenerate persons, was due to a fiat of<br>thy Mind. My second birth in days of yore was from thy eyes. Through thy<br>Grace, my third birth was from thy speech. My fourth birth. O puissant<br>Lord, was from thy ears. My fifth birth, excellent in all respects, was<br>from thy nose. O Lord, My sixth birth was, through thee, from an egg.<br>This is my seventh birth. It has occurred, O Lord, within this Lotus, and<br>it is meant to stimulate the intellect and desires of all the beings. At<br>each Creation I take birth from thee as thy son, O thou that art divested<br>of the three attributes. Indeed, O lotus-eyed one, I take birth as thy<br>eldest son, made up of Sattwa the foremost of three attributes. Thou art<br>endued with that nature which is Supreme. Thou springest from thyself. I<br>have been created by thee. The Vedas are my eyes. Hence, I transcend Time<br>itself. Those Vedas, which constitute my eyes, have been taken away from<br>me. I have, therefore, become blind. Do Thou awake from this Yoga-sleep.<br>Give me back my eyes. I am dear to thee and thou art dear to me. Thus<br>praised by Brahma, the illustrious Purusha, with face turned towards<br>every side, then shook off his slumber, resolved to recover the Vedas<br>(from the Daityas that had forcibly snatched them away). Applying his<br>Yoga-puissance, he assumed a second form. His body, equipt with an<br>excellent nose, became as bright as the Moon. He assumed an equine head<br>of great effulgence, which was the abode of the Vedas. The firmament,<br>with all its luminaries and constellations, became the crown of his head.<br>His locks of hair were long and flowing, and had the splendour of the<br>rays of the Sun. The regions above and below became his two ears. The<br>Earth became his forehead. The two rivers Ganga and Saraswati became his<br>two hips. The two oceans became his two eye-brows. The Sun and the Moon<br>became his two eyes. The twilight became his nose. The syllable Om became<br>his memory and intelligence. The lightning became his tongue. The<br>Soma-drinking Pitris became, it is said, his teeth. The two regions of<br>felicity, viz., Goloka and Brahmaloka, became his upper and lower lips.<br>The terrible night that succeeds universal destruction, and that<br>transcends the three attributes, became his neck. Having assumed this<br>form endued with the equine head and having diverse things for its<br>diverse limbs, the Lord of the universe disappeared then and there, and<br>proceeded to the nether regions. Having reached those regions, he set<br>himself to high Yoga. Adopting a voice regulated by the rules of the<br>science called Siksha, he began to utter loudly Vedic Mantras. His<br>pronunciation was distinct and reverberated through the air, and was<br>sweet in every respect. The sound of his voice filled the nether region<br>from end to end. Endued with the properties of all the elements, it was<br>productive of great benefits. The two Asuras, making an appointment with<br>the Vedas in respect of the time when they would come back to take them<br>up again, threw them down in the nether region, and ran towards the spot<br>whence those sounds appeared to come. Meanwhile, O king, the Supreme Lord<br>with the equine head, otherwise called Hari, who was himself in the<br>nether region, took up all the Vedas. Returning to where Brahma was<br>staying, he gave the Vedas unto him. Having restored the Vedas unto<br>Brahma, the Supreme Lord once more returned to his own nature. The<br>Supreme Lord also established his form with the equine head in the<br>North-Eastern region of the great ocean. Having (in this way) established<br>him who was the abode of the Vedas, he once more became the equine-headed<br>form that he was.[1896] The two Danavas Madhu and Kaitabha, not finding<br>the person from whom those sounds proceeded, quickly came back to that<br>spot. They cast their eyes around but beheld that the spot on which they<br>had thrown the Vedas was empty. Those two foremost of mighty Beings,<br>adopting great speed of motion, rose from the nether region. Returning to<br>where the primeval Lotus was that had given them birth, they saw the<br>puissant Being, the original Creator, staying in the form of Aniruddha of<br>fair complexion and endued with a splendour resembling that of the Moon.<br>Of immeasurable prowess, he was under the influence of Yoga-sleep, his<br>body stretched on the waters and occupying a space as vast as itself.<br>Possessed of great effulgence and endued with the attribute of stainless<br>Sattwa, the body of the Supreme Lord lay on the excellent hood of a snake<br>that seemed to emit flames of fire for the resplendence attaching to it.<br>Beholding the Lord thus lying, the two foremost of Danavas roared out a<br>loud laugh. Endued with the attributes of Rajas and Tamas, they<br>said.&#8212;'This is that Being of white complexion. He is now lying asleep.<br>Without doubt, this one has brought the Vedas away from the nether<br>region. Whose is he? Whose is he? Who is he? Why is he thus asleep on the<br>hood of a snake: Uttering these words, the two Danavas awakened Hari from<br>his Yoga-slumber. The foremost of Beings, (viz., Narayana), thus<br>awakened, understood that the two Danavas intended to have an encounter<br>with him in battle. Beholding the two foremost of Asuras prepared to do<br>battle with him, he also set his mind to gratify that desire of theirs.<br>Thereupon an encounter took place between those two on one side and<br>Narayana on the other. The Asuras Madhu and Kaitabha were embodiments of<br>the attributes of Rajas and Tamas. Narayana slew them both for gratifying<br>Brahma. He thence came to be called by the name of Madhusudana (slayer of<br>Madhu). Having compassed the destruction of the two Asuras and restored<br>the Vedas to Brahma, the Supreme Being dispelled the grief of Brahma.<br>Aided then by Hari and assisted by the Vedas, Brahma created all the<br>worlds with their mobile and immobile creatures. After this, Hari,<br>granting unto the Grandsire intelligence of the foremost order relating<br>to the Creation, disappeared there and then for going to the place he had<br>come from. It was thus that Narayana, having assumed the form equipt with<br>the horse-head, slew the two Danavas Madhu and Kaitabha (and disappeared<br>from the sight of Brahma). Once more, however, he assumed the same form<br>for the sake of causing the religion of Pravritti to flow in the<br>universe.'<br><br>"Thus did the blessed Hari assume in days of old that grand form having<br>the equine head. This, of all his forms, endued with puissance, is<br>celebrated as the most ancient. That person who frequently listens or<br>mentally recites this history of the assumption by Narayana of the form<br>equipt with the equine head, will never forget his Vedic or other lore.<br>Having adored with the austerest penances the illustrious deity with the<br>equine head, the Rishi Panchala (otherwise known as Galava) acquired the<br>science of Krama by proceeding along the path pointed out by the deity<br>(Rudra).[1897] I have thus recited to thee, O king the old story of<br>Hayasiras, consistent with the Vedas about which thou hadst asked me.<br>Whatever forms, the Supreme Deity desires to assume with a view to<br>ordaining the various affairs of the universe, he assumes those forms<br>immediately within himself by exercise of his own inherent powers. The<br>Supreme Deity, endued with every prosperity, is the receptacle of the<br>Vedas. He is the receptacle of Penances also. The puissant Hari is Yoga.<br>He is the embodiment of the Sankhya philosophy. He is that Para Brahman<br>of which we hear. Truth has Narayana for its refuge. Rita has Narayana<br>for its soul. The religion of Nivritti, in which there is no return, has<br>Narayana for its high abode. The other religion which has Pravritti for<br>its basis, has equally Narayana for its soul. The foremost of all the<br>attributes that belong to the element of Earth is scent. Scent has<br>Narayana for its soul. The attributes of Water, O king, are called the<br>Tastes (of the various kinds). These Tastes have Narayana for their soul.<br>The foremost attribute of Light is form. Form also has Narayana for its<br>soul. Touch, which is the attribute of Wind, is also said to have<br>Narayana for its soul. Sound, which is an attribute of space, has like<br>the others, Narayana for its soul. Mind also, which is the attribute of<br>the unmanifest (Prakriti), has Narayana for its soul. Time which is<br>computed by the motion of the celestial luminaries has similarly Narayana<br>for its soul. The presiding deities of Fame, of Beauty, and of Prosperity<br>have the same Supreme Deity for their soul. Both the Sankhya philosophy<br>and Yoga have Narayana for their soul. The Supreme Being is the cause of<br>all this, as Purusha. He is, again the cause of everything, as Pradhana<br>(or Prakriti). He is Swabhaba (the basis on which all things rest). He is<br>the doer or agent, and is the cause of that variety that is witnessed in<br>the universe. He is the diverse kinds of energy that act in the universe.<br>In these five ways he is that all-controlling invisible influence of<br>which people speak. Those employed in investigating the several topics of<br>enquiry with the aid of such reasons as are of wide application, regard<br>Hari to be identical with the five reasons adverted to above and as the<br>final refuge of all things. Indeed, the puissant Narayana, endued with<br>the highest Yoga puissance, is the one topic (of enquiry). The thoughts<br>of the denizen of all the worlds including Brahma and the high-souled<br>Rishis, of those that are Sankhyas and Yogins, of those that are Yatis,<br>and of those, generally, that are conversant with the Soul are fully<br>known to Kesava, but none of these can know what is thoughts are.<br>Whatever acts are performed in honour of the gods or the Pitris, whatever<br>gifts are made, whatever penances are performed, have Vishnu for their<br>refuge,&#8212;who is established upon his own supreme ordinances. He is named<br>Vasudeva because of his being the abode of all creatures. He is<br>immutable. He, is Supreme. He is the foremost of Rishis. He is endued<br>with the highest puissance. He is said to transcend the three attributes.<br>As Time (which runs smoothly without any sign) assumes indications when<br>it manifests itself in the form of successive seasons, even so He, though<br>really divested of attributes (for manifesting Himself). Even they that<br>are high-souled do not succeed in understanding his motions. Only those<br>foremost of Rishis that have knowledge of their Souls, succeed in<br>beholding in their hearts that Purusha who transcends all attributes."
