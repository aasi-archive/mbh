                            Vaisampayana said, "On one occasion, while residing in the retreat of<br>Nara and Narayana, Narada the son of Pramesthi, having duly accomplished<br>the rites and observances in honour of the deities, set himself to<br>perform thereafter the rites in honour of the Pitris. Beholding him thus<br>prepared, the eldest son of Dharma, viz., the puissant Nara addressed<br>him, saying, 'Whom art thou worshipping, O foremost of regenerate<br>persons, by these rites and observances in connection with the deities<br>and the Pitris? O foremost of all persons endued with intelligence, tell<br>me this, agreeably to the scriptures. What is this that thou art doing?<br>What also are the fruits desired by thee of those rites thou hast addrest<br>thyself in performing?'<br><br>"Narada said, "Thou saidst unto me on a former occasion that rites and<br>observances in honour of the deities should be accomplished. Thou saidst<br>that the rites in honour of the deities constitute the highest sacrifice<br>and are equivalent to the worship of the eternal Supreme Soul. Instructed<br>by that teaching, I always sacrifice in honour of the eternal and<br>immutable Vishnu, through these rites that I perform in worshipping the<br>deities. It is from that Supreme Deity that Brahma, the Grandsire of all<br>the worlds, took his rise in days of yore. That Brahma, otherwise called<br>Prameshthi, filled with cheerfulness, caused my sire (Daksha) to start<br>into being. I was the son of Brahma, created before all others, by a fiat<br>of his will (although I had to take birth afterwards as the son of Daksha<br>through a curse of that Rishi). O righteous and illustrious one, I am<br>per-forming these rites in honour of the Pitris for the sake of Narayana,<br>and agreeable to those ordinances that have been laid down by himself.<br>The illustrious Narayana is the father, mother, and grandfather (of all<br>creatures). In all sacrifices performed in honour of the Pitris, it is<br>that Lord of the universe who is adored and worshipped. On one occasion,<br>the deities, who were sires, taught their children the Srutis. Having<br>lost their knowledge of the Srutis, the sires had to acquire it again<br>from those sons unto whom they had communicated it. In consequence of<br>this incident, the sons, who had thus to communicate the Mantras unto<br>their sires, acquired the status of sires (and the sire, for having<br>obtained the Mantras from their sons, acquired the status of sons).[1891]<br>Without doubt, what the deities did on that occasion is well known to you<br>two. Sons and sires (on that occasion) had thus to worship each other.<br>Having first spread some blades of Kusa grass, the deities and the Pitris<br>(who were their children) placed three Pindas thereon and in this way<br>worshipped each other. I wish to know, however, the reason why the Pitris<br>in days of yore acquired the name of Pindas.'<br><br>"Nara and Narayana said, 'The Earth, in days of yore, with her belt of<br>seas, disappeared from the view. Govinda, assuming the form of a gigantic<br>boar, raised her up (with his mighty tusk), Having replaced the Earth in<br>her former position, that foremost of Purushas, his body smeared with<br>water and mud, set himself to do what was necessary for the world and its<br>denizens. When the sun reached the meridian, and the hour, therefore,<br>came for saying the morning prayers, the puissant Lord, suddenly shaking<br>off three balls of mud from his tusk, placed them upon the Earth, O<br>Narada, having previously spread thereon certain blades of grass. The<br>puissant Vishnu dedicated those balls of mud unto his own self, according<br>to the rites laid down in the eternal ordinance. Regarding the three<br>balls of mud that the puissant Lord had shaken off from his tusks as<br>Pindas, he then, with sesame seeds of oily kernel that arose from the<br>heat of his own body, himself performed the rite of dedication, sitting<br>with face turned towards the East. That foremost of deities then,<br>impelled by the desire of establishing rules of conduct for the denizens<br>of the three worlds, said these words:<br><br>"Vrishakapi said, I ant the Creator of the worlds. I am resolved to<br>create those that are to be called Pitris.&#8212;Saying these words, he began<br>to think of those high ordinances that should regulate the rites to be<br>gone through in honour of the Pitris. While thus engaged, he saw that the<br>three balls of mud, shaken off his tusk, had fallen towards the South. He<br>then said unto himself,&#8212;These balls, shaken off my tusk, have fallen on<br>the Earth towards the southern direction of her surface. Led by this, I<br>declare that these should be known henceforth by the name of Pitris. Let<br>these three that are of no particular shape, and that are only round,<br>come to be regarded as Pitris in the world. Even thus do I create the<br>eternal Pitris. I am the father, the grandfather, and the great<br>grandfather, and I should be regarded as residing in these three Pindas.<br>There is no one that is superior to me. Who is there whom I myself may<br>worship or adore with rites? Who, again, is my sire in the universe? I<br>myself am my grandfather. I am, indeed, the Grandsire and the Sire. I am<br>the one cause (of all the universe).&#8212;Having said these words, that God<br>of gods, Vrishakapi by name, offered those Pindas, O learned Brahmana, on<br>the breast of the Varaha mountains, with elaborate rites. By those rites<br>He worshipped His own self, and having finished the worship, disappeared<br>there and then. Hence have the Pitris come to be called by the name of<br>Pinda. Even this is the foundation of the designation. Agreeably to the<br>words uttered by Vrishakapi on that occasion, the Pitris receive the<br>worship offered by all. They who perform sacrifices in honour of and<br>adore the Pitris, the deities, the preceptor or other reverend senior<br>guests arrived at the house, kine, superior Brahmanas, the goddess Earth,<br>and their mothers, in thought, word, and deed, are said to adore and<br>sacrifice unto Vishnu himself. Pervading the bodies of all existent<br>creatures, the illustrious Lord is the Soul of all things. Unmoved by<br>happiness or misery, His attitude towards all is equal. Endued with<br>greatness, and of great soul, Narayana has been said to be the soul of<br>all things in the universe.'"
