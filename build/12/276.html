                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Cruel and sinful that we are, alas, we have slain<br>brothers and sires and grandsons and kinsmen and friends and sons. How, O<br>grandsire, shall we dispel this thirst for wealth. Alas, through that<br>thirst we have perpetrated many sinful deeds.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative of what was<br>said by the ruler of the Videhas unto the enquiring Mandavya. The ruler<br>of the Videhas said, 'I have nothing (in this world), yet I live in great<br>happiness. If the whole of Mithila (which is said to be my kingdom) burn<br>in a conflagration, nothing of mine will be burnt down. Tangible<br>possessions, however valuable, are a source of sorrow to men of<br>knowledge; while possessions of even little value fascinate the<br>foolish.[1320] Whatever happiness exists here, derivable from the<br>gratification of desire, and whatever heavenly happiness exists of high<br>value, do not come up to even a sixteenth part of the felicity that<br>attends the total disappearance of desire. As the horns of a cow grow<br>with the growth of the cow itself, after the same manner the thirst for<br>wealth increases with increasing acquisitions of wealth. Whatever the<br>object for which one feels an attachment, that object becomes a source of<br>pain when it is lost. One should not cherish desire. Attachment to desire<br>leads to sorrow. When wealth has been acquired, one should apply it to<br>purposes of virtue. One should even then give up desire.[1321] The man of<br>knowledge always looks upon other creatures even as he looks upon<br>himself. Having cleansed his soul and attained to success, he casts off<br>everything here.[1322] By casting off both truth and falsehood, grief and<br>joy, the agreeable and disagreeable, fearlessness and fear, one attains<br>to tranquillity, and becomes free from every anxiety. That thirst (for<br>earthly things) which is difficult of being cast off by men of foolish<br>understanding, which wanes not with the wane of the body, and which is<br>regarded as a fatal disease (by men of knowledge), one who succeeds in<br>casting off is sure to find felicity. The man of virtuous soul, by<br>beholding his own behaviour that has become bright as the moon and free<br>from evil of every kind, succeeds in happily attaining to great fame both<br>here and hereafter.' Hearing these words of the king, the Brahmana became<br>filled with joy, and applauding what he heard, Mandavya betook himself to<br>the path of Emancipation.'"
