                            "The Brahmana said, 'Without doubt, this is very wonderful, O Naga, I<br>have been highly gratified by listening to thee. By these words of thine<br>that are fraught with subtile meaning, thou hast shown me the way I am to<br>follow. Blessed be thou, I desire to depart hence O best of Nagas, thou<br>shouldst recollect me now and then and enquire after me by sending thy<br>servant.'<br><br>"The Naga said, 'The object that brought thee higher is still in thy<br>breast, for thou hast not as yet disclosed it to me. Where then wilt thou<br>go? Tell me, O regenerate one, what should be done by me, and what that<br>object is which brought thee hither. After the accomplishment of thy<br>business, whatever it is, expressed or unexpressed in speech, thou mayst<br>depart, O foremost of regenerate persons, saluting me and dismissed by me<br>cheerfully, O thou of excellent vows. Thou hast conceived a friendship<br>for me. O regenerate Rishi, it behoveth thee not to depart from this<br>place after having only seen me, thyself sitting under the shade of this<br>tree. Thou hast become dear to me and I have become dear to thee, without<br>doubt. All the persons in this city are thine. What objection then is<br>there, O sinless one, to pass some time in my house?&#8212;'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'It is even so, O thou of great wisdom, O Naga that<br>hast acquired a knowledge of the soul. It is very true that the deities<br>are not superior to thee in any respect. He that is thyself, is verily<br>myself, as he that is myself is truly thyself. Myself, thyself, and all<br>other creatures, shall all have to enter into the Supreme Soul. Doubt<br>penetrated my mind, O chief of Nagas, in the matter of the best means for<br>winning righteousness or merit. That doubt has been dispelled by thy<br>discourse, for I have learnt the value of the Unccha vow. I shall hence<br>follow that which is so very efficacious in the matter of beneficial<br>consequences. That, O blessed one, has become my certain conclusion now,<br>based on excellent reasons. I take thy leave. Blessings to thee. My<br>object has been accomplished, O Naga.'"<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Having saluted that foremost of Nagas in this way, the<br>Brahmana (named Dharmaranya), firmly resolved to follow the Unccha mode<br>of life, proceeded to the presence, O king, of Chyavana of Bhrigu's race,<br>from desire of being formally instructed and initiated in that vow.[1942]<br>Chyavana performed the Samskara rites of the Brahmana and formally<br>initiated him into the Unccha mode of life. The son of Bhrigu, O monarch,<br>recited this history to king Janaka in his place. King Janaka, in his<br>turn, narrated it to the celestial Rishi Narada of high soul. The<br>celestial Rishi Narada too, of stainless acts, repairing on one occasion<br>to the abode of Indra, the chief of the deities, gave to Indra this<br>history upon being asked by him. The chief of the celestials, having<br>obtained it thus from Narada, recited this blessed history to a conclave<br>consisting of all the foremost Brahmanas, O monarch. On the occasion,<br>again, of my dreadful encounter with Rama of Bhrigu's race (on the field<br>of Kurukshetra), the celestial Vasus, O king, recited this history to<br>me.[1943] Asked by thee, O foremost of righteous men, I have recited this<br>history that is excellent and sacred and fraught with great merit. Thou<br>hadst asked me about that constitutes the highest duty, O king. This<br>history is my answer to thy query. A brave man he was, O monarch, that<br>betook himself to the practice of the Unccha vow in this way, without<br>expectation of any fruit. Firmly resolved, that Brahmana, instructed, by<br>the chief of Nagas in this way about his duty, betook himself to the<br>practice of Yama and Niyama, and subsisting the while upon such food as<br>was allowed by the Unccha vow, proceeded to another forest.'"<br><br>The end of Santi Parva.
