                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O thou of mighty arms, tell me, after this what is<br>beneficial for us. O grandsire, I am never satiated with thy words which<br>seem to me like Amrita. What are those good acts, O best of men, by<br>accomplishing which a man succeeds in obtaining what is for his highest<br>benefit both here and hereafter, O giver of boons!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection I shall narrate to thee what the<br>celebrated king Janaka had enquired, in days of yore, of the high-souled<br>Parasara, 'What is beneficial for all creatures both in this world and<br>the next! Do thou tell me what should be known by all this connection.'<br>Thus questioned, Parasara, possessed of great ascetic merit and<br>conversant with the ordinances of every religion,[1497] said these words,<br>desirous of favouring the king.'<br><br>"Parasara said, 'Righteousness earned by acts is supreme benefit both in<br>this world and the next. The sages of the old have said that there is<br>nothing higher than Righteousness. By accomplishing the duties of<br>righteousness a man becomes honoured in heaven. The Righteousness, again,<br>of embodied creatures, O best of kings, consists in the ordinance (laid<br>down in the scriptures) on the subject of acts.[1498] All good men<br>belonging to the several modes of life, establishing their faith on that<br>righteousness, accomplish their respective duties.[1499] Four methods of<br>living, O child, have been ordained in this world. (Those four methods<br>are the acceptance of gifts for Brahmanas; the realisation of taxes for<br>Kshatriyas; agriculture for Vaisyas; and service of the three other<br>classes for the Sudras). Wherever men live the means of support come to<br>them of themselves. Accomplishing by various ways acts that are virtuous<br>or sinful (for the purpose of earning their means of support), living<br>creatures, when dissolved into their constituent elements attain to<br>diverse ends.[1500] As vessels of white brass, when steeped in liquefied<br>gold or silver, catch the hue of these metals, even so a living creature,<br>who is completely dependent upon the acts of his past lives takes his<br>colour from the character of those acts. Nothing can sprout forth without<br>a seed. No one can obtain happiness without having accomplished acts<br>capable of leading to happiness. When one's body is dissolved away (into<br>its constituent elements), one succeeds in attaining to happiness only in<br>consequence of the good acts of previous lives. The sceptic argues, O<br>child, saying, I do not behold that anything in this world is the result<br>of destiny or the virtuous and sinful acts of past lives. Inference<br>cannot establish the existence or operation of destiny.[1501] The<br>deities, the Gandharvas and the Danavas have become what they are in<br>consequence of their own nature (and not of their acts of past lives).<br>People never recollect in their next lives the acts done by them in<br>previous ones. For explaining the acquisition of fruits in any particular<br>life people seldom name the four kinds of acts alleged to have been<br>accomplished in past lives.[1502] The declarations having the Vedas for<br>their authority have been made for regulating the conduct of men in this<br>world, and for tranquillizing the minds of men. These (the sceptic says),<br>O child, cannot represent the utterances of men possessed of true wisdom.<br>This opinion is wrong. In reality, one obtains the fruits of whatever<br>among the four kinds of acts one does with the eye, the mind, the tongue,<br>and muscles.[1503] As the fruit of his acts, O king, a person sometimes<br>obtains happiness wholly, sometimes misery in the same way, and sometimes<br>happiness and misery blended together. Whether righteous or sinful, acts<br>are never destroyed (except by enjoyment or endurance of their<br>fruits).[1504] Sometimes, O child, the happiness due to good acts remains<br>concealed and covered in such a way that it does not display itself in<br>the case of the person who is sinking in life's ocean till his sorrows<br>disappear. After sorrow has beep exhausted (by endurance), one begins to<br>enjoy (the fruits of) one's good acts. And know, O king, that upon the<br>exhaustion of the fruits of good acts, those of sinful acts begin to<br>manifest themselves. Self-restraint, forgiveness, patience, energy,<br>contentment, truthfulness of speech, modesty, abstention from injury,<br>freedom from the evil practices called vyasana, and cleverness,&#8212;these<br>are productive of happiness. No creature is eternally subject to the<br>fruits of his good or bad acts. The man possessed of wisdom should always<br>strive to collect and fix his mind. One never has to enjoy or endure the<br>good and bad acts of another. Indeed, one enjoys and endures the fruits<br>of only those acts that one does oneself. The person that casts off both<br>happiness and misery walks along a particular path (the path, viz., of<br>knowledge). Those men, however, O king, who suffer themselves to be<br>attached to all worldly objects, tread along a path that is entirely<br>different. A person should rot himself do that act which, if done by<br>another, would call down his censure. Indeed, by doing an act that one<br>censures in others, one incurs ridicule. A Kshatriya bereft of courage, a<br>Brahmana that takes every kind of food, a Vaisya unendued with exertion<br>(in respect of agriculture and other moneymaking pursuits), a Sudra that<br>is idle (and, therefore, averse to labour), a learned person without good<br>behaviour, one of high birth but destitute of righteous conduct, a<br>Brahmana fallen away from truth, a woman that is unchaste and wicked, a<br>Yogin endued with attachments, one that cooks food for one's own self, an<br>ignorant person employed in making a discourse, a kingdom without a king<br>and a king that cherishes no affection for his subjects and who is<br>destitute of Yoga,&#8212;these all, O king, are deserving of pity!'"[1505]
