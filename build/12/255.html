                            "Bhishma said, 'Do thou, O son, O sinless one, listen once more, with<br>feelings of great pride, to the words that fell from the lips of the<br>Island-born Rishi on the subject of the enumeration of the entities. Like<br>unto a blazing fire (for having transcended all ignorance), the great<br>Rishi said these words unto his son who resembled a fire wrapped in<br>smoke.[1104] Instructed by what he said, I also, O son, shall again<br>expound to thee that certain knowledge (which dispels ignorance). The<br>properties possessed by earth are immobility, weight, hardness,<br>productiveness, scent, density, capacity to absorb scents of all kinds,<br>cohesion, habitableness (in respect of vegetables and animals), and that<br>attribute of the mind which is called patience of the capacity to bear.<br>The properties of water are coolness, taste, moisture, liquidity,<br>softness, agreeableness, tongue, fluidity, capacity to be congealed, and<br>power to melt many earthly products.[1105] The properties of fire are<br>irresistible energy, inflammability, heat, capacity t o soften, light,<br>sorrow, disease, speed, fury, and invariably upward motion. The<br>properties of the wind are touch that is neither hot nor cool, capacity<br>to assist the organ of speech, independence (in respect of motion),<br>strength, celerity, power to assist all kinds of emission or discharge,<br>power to raise other objects, breaths inhaled and exhaled, life (as the<br>attribute of Chit) and birth (including death). The properties of space<br>are sound, extension, capacity of being enclosed, absence of refuge for<br>resting upon absence of all necessity for such refuge, status of being<br>unmanifest, capacity for modification, incapacity for producing<br>resistance, material cause for producing the sense of hearing, and the<br>unoccupied portions of the human body. These are the fifty properties, as<br>declared, that constitute, the essence of the five elementary<br>entities.[1106] Patience, reasoning or disputation, remembrance,<br>forgetfulness or error, imagination, endurance, propensity towards good,<br>propensity towards evil, and restlessness,&#8212;these are the properties of<br>the mind. Destruction of both good and evil thoughts (i.e., dreamless<br>slumber), perseverance, concentration, decision, and ascertainment of all<br>things resting upon direct evidence, constitute the five properties of<br>the understanding.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'How can the understanding be said to have five<br>properties? How again, can the five senses be spoken of as properties (of<br>the five elementary entities)? Expound to me, O grandsire, all this that<br>seems to be very abstruse.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The understanding is said to possess altogether sixty<br>properties, for the understanding includes the five elements.[1107] All<br>those properties exist in a state of union with the Soul. The Vedas<br>declare, O son, that the elements, their (fifty) properties (together<br>with the mind and the understanding and their nine and five properties)<br>are all created by Him who is above all deterioration. These (one and<br>seventy) entities, therefore, are not eternal (like the Soul). The<br>theories contradicting the Revelation that have in the previous Vedas, O<br>son, been placed before thee (about the origin of the Universe and its<br>other incidents) are all defective in the eye of reason. Carefully<br>attending, however, in this world to all that I have said unto thee about<br>the Supreme Brahma, do thou, after attaining to the puissance that the<br>knowledge of Brahma offers, seek to win tranquillity of heart.'"[1108]
