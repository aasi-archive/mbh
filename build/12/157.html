                            "Bhishma said, 'Having settled this in his mind, the Salmali. in sorrow,<br>himself caused all his branches, principal and subsidiary, to be cut off.<br>Casting off his branches and leaves and flowers, at morn the tree looked<br>steadily at the Wind, as he came towards him. Filled with rage and<br>breathing hard, the Wind advanced, felling large trees, towards that spot<br>where the Salmali stood. Beholding him divested of top and branches and<br>leaves and flowers, the Wind, filled with joy, smilingly addressed that<br>lord of the forest which had before such a gigantic appearance, these<br>words.'<br><br>"The Wind said, 'Filled with rage, O Salmali, I would have done to thee<br>precisely what thou hast done to thyself by lopping off all thy branches.<br>Thou art now divested of thy proud top and flowers, and thou art now<br>without thy shoots and leaves. In consequence of thy own evil counsels,<br>thou hast been brought under my power.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Hearing these words of the Wind, the Salmali felt<br>great shame. Remembering also the words that Narada had said, he began to<br>repent greatly for his folly. Even in this way, O tiger among kings, a<br>weak and foolish person, by provoking the enmity of a powerful one, is at<br>last obliged to repent like the Salmali in fable. Even when possessed of<br>equal might, people do not suddenly wage hostilities with those that have<br>injured them. On the other hand, they display their might gradually, O<br>king! A person of foolish understanding should never provoke the<br>hostility of one that is possessed of intelligence. In such cases the<br>intelligence of the intelligent man penetrates (the subject upon which it<br>is employed) like fire penetrating a heap of dry grass. Intelligence is<br>the most precious possession that a person call have. Similarly, O king,<br>a man can have nothing here more valuable than might. One should,<br>therefore, overlook the wrongs inflicted by a person possessed of<br>superior strength, even as one should overlook (from compassion) the acts<br>of a child, and idiot, or one that is blind or deaf. The wisdom of this<br>saying is witnessed in thy case, O slayer of foes. The eleven Akshauhinis<br>(of Duryodhana), O thou of great splendour, and the seven (collected by<br>thyself), were not, in might equal to the single-handed Arjuna of high<br>soul. All the troops (of Duryodhana), therefore, were routed and slain by<br>that illustrious Pandava, that son of Paka's chastiser, as he coursed on<br>the field of battle, relying on his own strength. I have. O Bharata,<br>discoursed to thee of the duties of kings and the morality of duties in<br>detail. What else. O king, dost thou wish to hear!'"
