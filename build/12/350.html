                            Janamejaya said, "The Sankhya system, the Pancharatra scriptures, and the<br>Aranyaka-Vedas,&#8212;these different systems of knowledge or religion,&#8212;O<br>regenerate Rishi, are current in the world. Do all these systems preach<br>the same course of duties, or are the courses of duties preached by them,<br>O ascetic, different from one another? Questioned by me, do thou<br>discourse to me on Pravritti in due order!"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "I bow unto that great Rishi who is the dispeller of<br>darkness, and whom Satyavati bore to Parasara in the midst of an island,<br>who is possessed of great knowledge and who is endued with great<br>liberality of soul. The learned say that he is the origin of the<br>Grandsire Brahma; that he is the sixth form of Narayana; that he is the<br>foremost of Rishis; that he is endued with the puissance of Yoga; that as<br>the only son of his parents he is an incarnate portion of Narayana; and<br>that, born under extraordinary circumstances on an Island, he is the<br>inexhaustible receptacle of the Vedas. In the Krita age, Narayana of<br>great puissance and mighty energy, created him as his son. Verily, the<br>high-souled Vyasa is unborn and ancient and is the inexhaustible<br>receptacle of the Vedas!"<br><br>Janamejaya said, "O best of regenerate persons, it was thou that saidst<br>before this that the Rishi Vasishtha had a son of the name of Saktri and<br>that Saktri had a son of the name of Parasara, and that Parasara begot a<br>son named the Island-born Krishna endued with great ascetic merit. Thou<br>tellest me again that Vyasa is the son of Narayana. I ask, was it in some<br>former birth that Vyasa of immeasurable energy had sprung from Narayana?<br>O thou of great intelligence, do tell me of that birth of Vyasa which was<br>due to Narayana!"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Desirous of understanding the meaning of the Srutis,<br>my preceptor, that ocean of penances, who is exceedingly devoted to the<br>observance of all scriptural duties and the acquisition of knowledge,<br>dwelt for some time in a particular region of the Himavat mountains.<br>Endued with great intelligence, he became fatigued with his penances in<br>consequence of the great strain on his energies occasioned by the<br>composition of the Mahabharata. At that time, Sumanta and Jaimini and<br>Paila of firm vows and myself numbering the fourth, and Suka his own son,<br>attended on him. All of us, O king, in view of the fatigue our preceptor<br>felt, waited dutifully upon him, engaged in doing all that was necessary<br>for dispelling that fatigue of his. Surrounded by these disciples of his,<br>Vyasa shone in beauty on the breast of the Himavat mountains like the<br>Lord of all the ghostly beings, viz., Mahadeva, in the midst of those<br>ghostly attendants of his. Having recapitulated the Vedas with all their<br>branches as also the meanings of all the Verses in the Mahabharata, one<br>day, with rapt attention, all of us approached our preceptor who, having<br>controlled his senses, was at time rapt up in thought. Availing ourselves<br>of an interval in the conversation, we asked that foremost of regenerate<br>persons to expound to us the meanings of the Vedas and the Verses in the<br>Mahabharata and narrate to us the incidents as well of his own birth from<br>Narayana. Conversant as he was with all topics of enquiry, he at first<br>discoursed to us on the interpretations of the Srutis and the<br>Mahabharata, and then set himself to narrate to us the following<br>incidents relating to his birth from Narayana.<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'Listen, ye disciples, to this foremost of narratives, to<br>this best of histories that relates again to the birth of a Rishi.<br>Appertaining to the Krita age, this narrative has become known to me<br>through my penances, ye regenerate ones. On the occasion of the seventh<br>creation, viz., that which was due to the primeval Lotus, Narayana,<br>endued with the austerest penances, transcending both good and ill, and<br>possessed of unrivalled splendour, at first created Brahma, from his<br>navel. After Brahma had started into birth, Narayana addressed him,<br>saying; Thou halt sprung from my navel. Endued with puissance in respect<br>of creation, do thou set thyself to create diverse kinds of creatures,<br>rational and irrational. Thus addressed by the author of his being,<br>Brahma with his mind penetrated by anxiety, felt the difficulty of his<br>task and became unwilling to do what he was commenced to do. Bowing his<br>head unto the boon-giving and illustrious Hari, the Lord of the universe,<br>Brahma said these words unto him,&#8212;I bow to thee, O Lord of the deities,<br>but I ask what puissance have I to create diverse creatures? I have no<br>wisdom. Do thou ordain what should be ordained in view of this. Thus<br>addressed by Brahma, the Lord of the universe, viz., Narayana,<br>disappeared there and then from Brahma's sight. The Supreme Lord, the god<br>of gods, the chief of those endowed with intelligence, then began to<br>think. The Goddess of Intelligence forthwith made her appearance before<br>the puissant Narayana. Himself transcending all Yoga, Narayana then, by<br>dint of Yoga, applied the Goddess of Intelligence properly. The<br>illustrious and puissant and immutable Hari, addressing the Goddess of<br>Intelligence who was endued with activity and goodness and all the<br>puissance of Yoga, said unto her these words:&#8212;For the accomplishment of<br>the task of creating all the worlds do thou enter into Brahma. Commanded<br>thus by the Supreme Lord, Intelligence forthwith entered Brahma. When<br>Hari beheld that Brahma had become united with Intelligence. He once more<br>addressed him, saying&#8212;Do thou now create diverse kinds of<br>creatures.&#8212;Replaying unto Narayana by uttering the word 'Yes,' Brahma<br>reverently accepted the command of his progenitor. Narayana then<br>disappeared from Brahma's presence, and in a moment repaired to his own<br>place, known by the name of Deva (Light or Effulgence). Returning to His<br>own disposition (of Uumanifestness), Hari remained in that state of<br>oneness. After the task of creation, however, had been accomplished by<br>Brahma, another thought arose in the mind of Narayana. Indeed, he<br>reflected in this strain:&#8212;Brahma, otherwise called Parameshthi, has<br>created all these creatures, consisting of Daityas and Danavas and<br>Gandharvas and Rakshasas. The helpless Earth has become burthened with<br>the weight of creatures. Many among the Daityas and Danavas and Rakshasas<br>on Earth will become endued with great strength. Possessed of penances,<br>they will at diverse times succeed in acquiring many excellent boons.<br>Swelling with pride and might in consequence of those boons that they<br>will succeed in obtaining, they will oppress and afflict the deities and<br>the Rishis possessed of ascetic might. It is, therefore, meet that I<br>should now and then lighten the burthen of the Earth, by assuming diverse<br>forms one after another as occasion would require. I shall achieve this<br>task by chastising the wicked and upholding the righteous. (Thus looked<br>after by me), the Earth, which is the embodiment of Truth, will succeed<br>in bearing her load of creatures. Assuming the form of a mighty snake I<br>myself have to uphold the Earth in empty space. Upheld by me thus, she<br>will uphold the entire creation, mobile and immobile. Incarnated on the<br>Earth, therefore, in different forms, I shall have to rescue her at such<br>times from peril. Having reflected in this way, the illustrious slayer of<br>Madhu created diverse forms in his mind in which to appear from time to<br>time for accomplishing the task in view. Assuming the form of a Boar, of<br>Man-lion, of a Dwarf, and of human beings, I shall quell or slay such<br>enemies of the deities as will become wicked and ungovernable. After<br>this, the original Creator of the universe once more uttered the<br>syllable, Bho, causing the atmosphere to resound with it. From this<br>syllable of speech (Saraswati) arose a Rishi of the name Saraswat. The<br>son, thus born of the Speech of Narayana, came to be, also called by the<br>name of Apantara-tamas. Endued with great puissance, he was fully<br>conversant with the past, the present, and the future. Firm in the<br>observance of vows, he was truthful in speech.[1911] Unto that Rishi who,<br>after birth, had bowed his head unto Narayana, the latter, who was the<br>original Creator of all the deities and possessed of a nature that was<br>immutable, said those words: Thou shouldst devote thy attention to the<br>distribution of the Vedas, O foremost of all persons endued with<br>intelligence.[1912] Do thou, therefore, O ascetic, accomplish what I<br>command thee.&#8212;In obedience to this command of the Supreme Lord from<br>whose Speech the Rishi Apantaratamas sprang into existence, the latter,<br>in the Kalpa named after the Self-born Manu, distributed and arranged the<br>Vedas. For that act of the Rishi, the illustrious Hari became gratified<br>with him, as also for his well-performed penances, his vow and<br>observances, and his restraint of the senses or passions. Addressing<br>him,&#8212;Narayana said,&#8212;At each Manwantara, O son, thou wilt act in this<br>way with respect to the Vedas. Thou shalt, in consequence of this act of<br>thine, be immutable, O regenerate one, and incapable of being transcended<br>by any one. When the Kali age will set in, certain princes of Bharata's<br>line, to be called by the name of Kauravas, will take their birth from<br>thee. They will be celebrated over the Earth as high-souled princes<br>ruling over powerful kingdoms. Born of thee, dissensions will break out<br>among them ending in their destruction at one another's hands excepting<br>yourself. O foremost of regenerate persons,[1913] in that age also,<br>endued with austere penances, thou wilt distribute the Vedas into diverse<br>classes. Indeed, in that dark age, thy complexion will become dark. Thou<br>shalt cause diverse kinds of duties to flow and diverse kinds of<br>knowledge also. Although endued with austere penances, yet thou shalt<br>never be able to free thyself from desire and attachment to the world.<br>Thy son, however, will be freed from every attachment like unto the<br>Supreme Soul, through the grace of Madhava. It will not be otherwise. He<br>whom learned Brahmanas call the mind-born son of the Grandsire, viz.,<br>Vasishtha endued with great intelligence and like unto an ocean of<br>penances, and whose splendour transcends that of the Sun himself, will be<br>the progenitor of a race in which a great Rishi of the name of Parasara,<br>possessed of mighty energy and prowess, will take his birth. That<br>foremost of persons, that ocean of Vedas, that abode of penances, will<br>become thy sire (when thou wilt take birth in the Kali age). Thou shalt<br>take thy birth as the son of a maiden residing in the house of her sire,<br>through an act of congress with the great Rishi Parasara. Doubts thou<br>wilt have none with respect to the imports of things past, present, and<br>future. Endued with penances and instructed by me, thou wilt behold the<br>incidents of thousands and thousands of ages long past away. Thou wilt<br>see through thousands and thousands of ages also in the future. Thou<br>shalt, in that birth, behold me, O ascetic,&#8212;me that am without birth and<br>death,&#8212;incarnated on Earth (as Krishna of Yadu's race), armed with the<br>discus. All this will happen to thee, O ascetic, through the merit that<br>will be thine in consequence of thy ceaseless devotion to me. These words<br>of mine will never be otherwise. Thou shalt be one of the foremost of<br>creatures. Great shall be thy fame. Surya's son Sani (Saturn) will, in a<br>future Kalpa, take birth as the great Manu of that period. During that<br>Manwantara, O son, thou shalt, in respect of merits, be superior to even<br>the Manus of the several periods. Without doubt, thou shalt be so through<br>my grace. Whatever exists in the world represents the result of my<br>exertion. The thoughts of others may not correspond with their acts. As<br>regards myself, however, I always ordain what I think, without the least<br>impediment![1914] Having said these words unto the Rishi Apantaratamas,<br>otherwise called by the name of Saraswat, the Supreme Lord dismissed him,<br>saying unto him.&#8212;Go. I am he that was born as Apantaratamas through the<br>command of Hari. Once more have I taken birth as the celebrated<br>Krishna-Dwaipayana, a delighter of the race of Vasishtha.[1915] I have<br>thus told you, my dear disciples, the circumstances, of my own former<br>birth which was due to the grace of Narayana in so much that I was a very<br>portion of Narayana himself. Ye foremost of intelligent persons, I<br>underwent, in days of yore, the austerest penances, with the aid of the<br>highest abstraction of the mind. Ye sons, moved by my great affection for<br>yourselves that are devoted to me with reverence, I have told you<br>everything relating to what you wished to know from me, viz., my first<br>birth in days of remote antiquity and that other birth subsequent to it<br>(viz., the present one)!"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "I have thus narrated to thee, O monarch, the<br>circumstances connected with the former birth of our revered preceptor,<br>viz., Vyasa of unstained mind, as asked by thee. Listen to me once again.<br>There are diverse kinds of cults, O royal sage, that go by diverse names<br>such as Sankhya, Yoga, the Pancha-ratra, Vedas, and Pasupati. The<br>promulgator of Sankhya cult is said to be the great Rishi Kapila. The<br>primeval Hiranyagarbha, and none else, is the promulgator of the Yoga<br>system. The Rishi Apantaratamas is said to be the preceptor of the Vedas,<br>some call that Rishi by the name of Prachina-garbha. The cult known by<br>the name of Pasupata was promulgated by the Lord of Uma, that master of<br>all creatures, viz., the cheerful Siva, otherwise known by the name of<br>Sreekantha, the son of Brahma. The illustrious Narayana is himself the<br>promulgator of the cult, in its entirety, contained in the Pancharatra<br>scriptures. In all these cults, O foremost of kings, it is seen that the<br>puissant Narayana is the one sole object of exposition. According to the<br>scriptures of these cults and the measure of knowledge they contain,<br>Narayana is the one sole object of worship they inculcate. Those persons<br>whose visions, O king, are blinded by darkness, fail to understand that<br>Narayana is the Supreme Soul pervading the entire universe. Those persons<br>of wisdom who are the authors of the scriptures say that Narayana, who is<br>a Rishi, is the one object of reverent worship in the universe. I say<br>that there is no other being like Him. The Supreme Deity, called by the<br>name of Hari, resides in the hearts of those that have succeeded (with<br>the aid of the scriptures and of inference) in dispelling all doubts.<br>Madhava never resides in the hearts of those that are under the sway of<br>doubts and that would dispute away everything with the aid of false<br>dialectics. They that are conversant with the Pancharatra scriptures,<br>that are duly observant of the duties laid down therein, and that are<br>devoted to Narayana with their whole souls, succeed in entering into<br>Narayana. The Sankhya and the Yoga systems are eternal. All the Vedas,<br>again, O monarch, are eternal. The Rishis, in all these systems of cult,<br>have declared that this universe existing from ancient times is<br>Narayana's self. Thou shouldst know that whether acts, good or bad, are<br>laid down in the Vedas and occurrence in heaven and Earth, between the<br>sky and the waters, are all caused by and flow from that ancient Rishi<br>Narayana.
