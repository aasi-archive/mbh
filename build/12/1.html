                            (Rajadharmanusasana Parva)<br><br>OM! HAVING BOWED down to Narayana, and Nara, the foremost of male beings,<br>and unto the goddess Saraswati, must the word Jaya be uttered.<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Having offered oblations, of water unto all their<br>friends and kinsmen, the sons of Pandu, and Vidura, and Dhritarashtra,<br>and all the Bharata ladies, continued to dwell there (on the banks of the<br>sacred stream). The high-souled sons of Pandu desired to pass the period<br>of mourning,[1] which extended for a month, outside the Kuru city. After<br>king Yudhishthira the just had performed the water-rites, many<br>high-souled sages crowned with ascetic success and many foremost of<br>regenerate Rishis came there to see the monarch. Among them were the<br>Island-born (Vyasa), and Narada, and the great Rishi Devala, and<br>Devasthana, and Kanwa. They were all accompanied by best of their pupils.<br>Many other members of the regenerate order, possessed of wisdom and<br>accomplished in the Vedas, leading lives of domesticity or belonging to<br>the Snataka class, came to behold the Kuru king. Those high-souled ones,<br>as they came, were duly worshipped by Yudhishthira. The great Rishis then<br>took their seats on costly carpets. Accepting the worship suited to that<br>period (of mourning and impurity) that was offered them, they sat in due<br>order around the king. Thousands of Brahmanas offered consolation and<br>comfort to that king of kings residing on the sacred banks of the<br>Bhagirathi with heart exceedingly agitated by grief. Then Narada, after<br>having accosted the Rishis with the Island-born for their first, in due<br>time, addressed Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, saying, 'Through the<br>might of thy arms and the grace of Madhava, the whole Earth, O<br>Yudhishthira, hath been righteously won by thee. By good luck, thou hast<br>escaped with life from this dreadful battle. Observant as thou art o f<br>the duties of a Kshatriya, dost thou not rejoice, O son of Pandu? Having<br>slain all thy foes, shalt thou not gratify thy friends, O king? Having<br>obtained this prosperity, I hope, grief doth not afflict thee still.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Indeed the whole Earth hath been subjugated by me<br>through my reliance on the might of Krishna's arms, through the grace of<br>the Brahmanas, and through the strength of Bhima and Arjuna. This heavy<br>grief, however, is always sitting in my heart, viz., that through<br>covetousness I have caused this dreadful carnage of kinsmen. Having<br>caused the death of the dear son of Subhadra, and of the sons of<br>Draupadi, this victory, O holy one, appears to me in the light of a<br>defeat. What wilt Subhadra of Vrishni's race, that sister-in-law of mine,<br>say unto me? What also will the people residing in Dwaraka say unto the<br>slayer of Madhu when he goes thither from this place? This Draupadi,<br>again, who is ever engaged in doing what is agreeable to us, bereaved of<br>sons and kinsmen, is paining me exceedingly. This is another topic, O<br>holy Narada, about which I will speak to thee. In consequence of Kunti<br>having kept her counsels close in respect of a very important matter,<br>great has been my grief. That hero who had the strength of ten thousand<br>elephants, who in this world was an unrivalled car-warrior, who was<br>possessed of leonine pride and gait, who was endued with great<br>intelligence and compassion, whose liberality was very great, who<br>practised many high vows, who was the refuge of the Dhartarashtras, who<br>was sensitive about his honour, whose prowess was irresistible, who was<br>ready to pay off all injuries and was always wrathful (in battle), who<br>overthrew us in repeated encounters, who was quick in the use of weapons,<br>conversant with every mode of warfare, possessed of great skill, and<br>endued with wonderful valour (that Karna) was a son of Kunti, born<br>secretly of her, and therefore, a uterine brother of ours. Whilst we were<br>offering oblations of water unto the dead, Kunti spoke of him as the son<br>of Surya. Possessed of every virtue, that child had been cast into the<br>water. Having placed him in a basket made of light materials, Kunti<br>committed him to the current of Ganga. He who was regarded by the world<br>as a Suta's child born of Radha, was really the eldest son of Kunti and,<br>therefore, our uterine brother. Covetous of kingdom, alas, I have<br>unwittingly caused that brother of mine to be slain. It is this that is<br>burning my limbs like a fire burning a heap of cotton. The white-steeded<br>Arjuna knew him not for a brother. Neither I, nor Bhima, nor the twins,<br>knew him for such. He, however, of excellent bow, knew us (for his<br>brothers). We have heard that on one occasion Pritha went to him for<br>seeking our good and addressed him, saying, 'Thou art my son!' That<br>illustrious hero, however, refused to obey Pritha's wishes. Subsequently,<br>we are informed, he said unto his mother these words, 'I am unable to<br>desert Duryodhana in battle! If I do so, it would be a dishonourable,<br>cruel, and ungrateful act. If, yielding to thy wishes, I make peace with<br>Yudhishthira, people will say that I am afraid of the white-steeded<br>Arjuna. Having vanquished Arjuna with Kesava, therefore, in battle, I<br>will subsequently make peace with Dharma's son.' Even these were his<br>words as we have heard. Thus answered, Pritha once more addressed her son<br>of broad chest and said, 'Fight Phalguna then, but spare my four other<br>sons.' The intelligent Karna, with joined hands, then replied unto his<br>trembling mother, saying, 'If I get thy four other sons even under my<br>power, I will not slay them. Without doubt, O goddess, thou shalt<br>continue to have five sons. If Karna be slain with Arjuna, thou shalt<br>have five! If, on the other hand, Arjuna be slain, thou shalt have five,<br>numbering me.' Desirous of the good of her children, his mother once more<br>said unto him, 'Go, O Karna, do good unto those brothers of thine whose<br>good thou always seekest.' Having said these words, Pritha took his leave<br>and came back to her abode. That hero has been slain by Arjuna,&#8212;the<br>uterine brother by the brother! Neither Pritha, nor he, had ever<br>disclosed the secret, O lord! That hero and great bowman was therefore<br>slain by Arjuna in battle. Subsequently I have come to know, O best of<br>regenerate ones, that he was my uterine brother. Indeed, at Pritha's<br>words I have come to know that Karna was the eldest born! Having caused<br>my brother to be slain, my heart is burning exceedingly. If I had both<br>Karna and Arjuna for aiding me, I could have vanquished Vasudeva himself.<br>Whilst I was tortured in the midst of the assembly by the wicked-souled<br>sons of Dhritarashtra, my wrath, suddenly provoked, became cooled at<br>sight of Karna. Even while listening to the harsh and bitter words of<br>Karna himself on that occasion of our match at dice, to the words, that<br>Karna uttered from desire of doing what was agreeable to Duryodhana, my<br>wrath became cooled at sight of Karna's feet. It seemed to me that<br>Karna's feet resembled the feet of our mother Kunti. Desirous of finding<br>out the reason of that resemblance between him and our mother, I<br>reflected for a long time. With even my best exertions I failed to find<br>the cause. Why, indeed, did the earth swallow up the wheels of his car at<br>the time of battle? Why was my brother cursed? It behoveth thee to recite<br>all this to me. I desire to hear everything from thee, O holy one! Thou<br>art acquainted with everything in this world and thou knowest both the<br>past and the future!'
