                            "Yudhishthira said, 'If any person, desiring to accomplish acts (of<br>charity and sacrifices), fails to find (the necessary) wealth, and thirst<br>of wealth overwhelms him, what is that which he must do for obtaining<br>happiness?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'He that regards everything (viz., joy and sorrow, honour<br>and insult, etc.,) with an equal eye, that never exerts himself (for<br>gratifying his desire for earthly possessions), that practises<br>truthfulness of speech, that is freed from all kinds of attachment, and<br>that has no desire for action, is, O Bharata, a happy man. These five,<br>the ancients say, are the means for the acquisition of perfect<br>tranquillity or emancipation. These are called Heaven. These are<br>Religion. These constitute the highest happiness. In this connection is<br>cited the old narrative of what Manki had sung, when freed from<br>attachments, Listen to it, O Yudhishthira! Desirous of wealth, Manki<br>found that he was repeatedly doomed to disappointments. At last with a<br>little remnant of his property he purchased a couple of young bulls with<br>a yoke for training them (to agricultural labour). One day the two bulls<br>properly tied to the yoke, were taken out for training (in the fields).<br>Shying at the sight of a camel that was lying down on the road, the<br>animals suddenly ran towards the camel, and fell upon its neck. Enraged<br>at finding the bulls fall upon its neck, the camel, endued with great<br>speed, rose up and ran at a quick pace, bearing away the two helpless<br>creatures dangling on either side of its neck. Beholding his two bulls<br>thus borne away by that strong camel, and seeing that they were at the<br>point of death, Manki began to say, 'If wealth be not ordained by<br>destiny, it can never be acquired by even a clever man exerting himself<br>with attention and confidence and accomplishing with skill all that is<br>necessary towards that end. I had, before this, endeavoured by diverse<br>means and devotion to earn wealth. Behold this misfortune brought about<br>by destiny to the property I had! My bulls are borne away, rising and<br>falling, as the camel is running in an uneven course. This occurrence<br>seems to be an accident.[523] Alas, those dear bulls of mine are dangling<br>on the camel's neck like a couple of gems! This is only the result of<br>Destiny. Exertion is futile in what is due to Chance. Or, if the<br>existence of anything like Exertion (as an agent in the production of<br>results) be admitted, a deeper search would discover Destiny to be at the<br>bottom.[524] Hence, the person that desires happiness should renounce all<br>attachment. The man without attachments, no longer cherishing any desire<br>for earning wealth, can sleep happily. Ho, it was well said by Suka while<br>going to the great forest from his father's abode, renouncing<br>everything![525]&#8212;Amongst these two, viz., one who obtains the fruition<br>of all his wishes, and one who casts off every wish, the latter, who<br>renounces all, is superior to the former who obtains the fruition of all.<br>No one could ever attain to the end of desire.[526] Only he that is<br>destitute of knowledge and judgments feels an avidity for protecting his<br>body and life.&#8212;Forbear from every desire for action. O my Soul that art<br>possessed by cupidity, adopt tranquillity by freeing thyself from all<br>attachments! Repeatedly hast thou been deceived (by desire and hope). How<br>is it that thou dost not still free thyself from attachments? If I am not<br>one that deserves destruction at thy hands, if I am one with whom thou<br>shouldst sport in delight, then, O my wealth-coveting Soul, do not induce<br>me towards cupidity. Thou hast repeatedly lost thy hoarded wealth. O my<br>wealth-coveting and foolish Soul, when wilt thou succeed in emancipating<br>thyself from the desire of wealth? Shame on my foolishness! I have become<br>a toy of thine! It is thus that one becomes a slave of others. No one<br>born on earth did ever attain to the end of desire, and to one that will<br>take birth will succeed in attaining to it. Casting off all acts, I have<br>at last been roused from sleep. I am now awake. Without doubt, O Desire,<br>thy heart is as hard as adamant, since though affected by a hundred<br>distresses, thou does not break into a hundred pieces! I know thee, O<br>Desire, and all those things that are dear to thee! Seeking what is dear<br>to thee, I shall feel happiness in my own Self.[527] O Desire, I know thy<br>root. Thou springest from Will.[528]&#8212;I shall, therefore, avoid Will.<br>Thou shalt then be destroyed with thy roots. The desire for wealth can<br>never be fraught with happiness. If acquired, great is the anxiety that<br>the acquirer feels. If lost after acquisition, that is felt as death.<br>Lastly, respecting acquisition itself, it is very uncertain. Wealth<br>cannot be got by even the surrender of one's person. What can be more<br>painful than this? When acquired, one is never gratified with its<br>measure, but one continues to seek it. Like the sweet water of the<br>Ganges, wealth only increases one's hankering. It is my destruction. I am<br>now awakened. Do thou, O Desire, leave me! Let that Desire which has<br>taken refuge in this my body,&#8212;this compound of (five) elements,&#8212;go<br>whithersoever it chooses and live happily whithersoever it likes.[529] Ye<br>all that are not of the Soul, I have no joy in you, for ye follow the<br>lead of Msire and Cupidity! Abandoning all of you I shall take refuge in<br>the quality of Goodness.[530] Beholding all creatures in my own body and<br>my own mind, and devoting my reason to Yoga, my life to the instructions<br>of the wise, and soul to Brahma, I shall happily rove through the world,<br>without attachment and without calamities of any kinds, so that thou<br>mayst not be able to plunge me again into such sorrows![531] If I<br>continue to be agitated by thee, O Desire, I shall necessarily be without<br>a path (by which to effect my deliverance). Thou, O Desire, art always<br>the progenitor of thirst, of grief, and of fatigue and toil. I think the<br>grief that one feels at the loss of wealth is very keen and far greater<br>than what one feels under any other circumstances. Kinsmen and friends<br>disregard him that has lost his wealth. With various kinds of humiliation<br>that number by thousands, there are many faults in property that are more<br>painful still. On the other hand, the very small happiness that resides<br>in wealth is mingled with pain and sorrow.[532] Robbers slay, in the<br>sight of all, the person that is possessed of wealth, or afflict him with<br>various kinds of severity, or always fill him with fear. At last, after a<br>long time, I have understood that the desire for wealth is fraught with<br>sorrow. Whatever the object, O Desire, upon which thou settest thy heart,<br>thou forcest me to pursue it! Thou art without judgment. Thou art a fool.<br>Thou art difficult of being contented. Thou canst not be gratified. Thou<br>burnest like fire. Thou dost not enquire (in pursuing an object) whether<br>it is easy or difficult of attainment. Thou canst not be filled to the<br>brim, like the nether region. Thou wishest to plunge me into sorrow. From<br>this day, O Desire, I am incapable of living with thee! I who had felt<br>despair, at first, at the loss of my property, have now attained to the<br>high state of perfect freedom from attachments. At this moment I no<br>longer think of thee and thy train. I had, before this, felt great misery<br>on thy account. I do not (now) regard myself as destitute of<br>intelligence. Having adopted Renunciation in consequence of loss of my<br>property, I can now rest, freed from every kind of fever. I cast thee<br>off, O Desire, with all the passions of my heart. Thou shalt not again<br>dwell with me or sport with me. I shall forgive them that will slander or<br>speak ill of me. I shall not injure even when injured. If anybody from<br>aversion speaks disagreeable words of me, disregarding those words I<br>shall address him in agreeable speeches. In contentment of heart and with<br>all my senses at case, I shall always live upon what may be got by me. I<br>shall not contribute to the gratification of the wishes entertained by<br>thee that art my foe. Freedom from attachment, emancipation from desire,<br>contentment, tranquillity, truth, self-restraint, forgiveness, and<br>universal compassion are the qualities that have now I come to me.<br>Therefore, let Desire, cupidity, thirst, miserliness avoid me. I have now<br>adopted the path of Goodness. Having cast off Desire and Cupidity, great<br>is my happiness now. I shall no longer yield to the influence of Cupidity<br>and no longer suffer misery like a person of uncleansed soul. One is sure<br>to obtain happiness according to the measure of the desires he may be<br>able to cast off. Truly, he who yields himself up to Desire always<br>suffers misery. Whatever passions connected with Desire are cast off by a<br>person, all appertain to the quality of Passion. Sorrow and shamelessness<br>and discontent all arise from Desire and Wealth. Like a person plunging<br>in the hot season into a cool lake, I have now entered into Brahma, I<br>have abstained from work. I have freed myself from grief. Pure happiness<br>has now come to me. The felicity that results from the gratification of<br>Desire, or that other purer felicity which one enjoys in heaven, does not<br>come to even a sixteenth part of that which arises upon the abandonment<br>of all kinds of thirst! Killing the principle of desire, which with the<br>body makes an aggregate of seven, and which is a bitter foe, I have<br>entered the immortal city of Brahma and shall pass my days there in<br>happiness like a king!' Relying upon such intelligence, Manki freed<br>himself from attachments, casting off all desires and attaining to Brahma<br>that abode of the highest felicity. Indeed, in consequence of the loss of<br>his two bulls Manki attained to immortality. Indeed, because he cut the<br>very roots of desire, he attained, through that means, to high felicity.'"
