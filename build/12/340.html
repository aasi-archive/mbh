                            "Bhishma said, 'Thus hymned with names that were not known to others, the<br>Divine Narayana having the universe for his form showed himself to the<br>ascetic Narada. His form was somewhat purer than the moon and differed<br>from the moon in some respects. He somewhat resembled a blazing fire in<br>complexion. The puissant Lord was somewhat of the form of Vishti.[1828]<br>He resembled in some respects the feathers of the parrot, and in some a<br>mass of pure crystal. He resembled in some respects a hill of antimony<br>and in some a mass of pure gold. His complexion somewhat resembled the<br>coral when first formed, and was somewhat white. In some respects that<br>complexion resembled the hue of gold and in some that of the lapis<br>lazuli. In some respects it resembled the hue of the blue lapis lazuli<br>and in some that of sapphire. In some respects it resembled the hue of<br>the peacock's neck, and in some that of a string of pearls. Bearing these<br>diverse kinds of hues on his person, the eternal Deity appeared before<br>Narada. He had a thousand eyes and was possessed of great beauty. He had<br>a hundred heads and a hundred feet. He had a thousand stomachs and a<br>thousand arms. He seemed to be still inconceivable to the mind. With one<br>of his mouths he uttered the syllable Om and then the Gayatri following<br>Om. With mind under complete control, the great Deity, called by the<br>names of Hari and Narayana, by his other mouths, multitudinous in number,<br>uttered many mantras from the four Vedas which are known by the name of<br>Aranyaka. The Lord of all the deities, the great God who is adorned in<br>sacrifices, held in his hands a sacrificial altar, a Kamandalu, few white<br>gems, a pair of sandal, a bundle of Kusa blades, a deer-skin, a<br>toothstick, and a little blazing fire.[1829] With cheerful soul, that<br>foremost of regenerate persons, viz., Narada of restraining speech, bowed<br>unto the great God and adored Him. Unto him whose head was still bent low<br>in veneration, the first of all the deities, who is free from<br>deterioration, said the following words.<br><br>"'The Holy one said, The great Rishis, Ekata, Dwita, and Trita, came to<br>this realm from desire of obtaining a sight of me. They, however, were<br>unable to have the fruition of their wishes. Nor can any one have a sight<br>of me save those persons that are devoted to me with their whole hearts.<br>As regards thee, thou art verily the foremost of all persons devoted to<br>me with all their souls. These are my bodies, the best ones that I<br>assume. These were born, O regenerate one, in the house of Dharma. Do<br>thou worship them always, and do thou perform those rites that are laid<br>down in the ordinances with respect to that worship. O Brahmana, do thou<br>ask of me the boons thou desirest. I am gratified with thee to-day, and I<br>appear unto thee now in my universal form as freed from decay and<br>deterioration.<br><br>"Narada said, Since, O holy one, I have today succeeded in obtaining a<br>sight of thee. I regard that I have won without any delay the fruits of<br>my penances, O God, of my self-restraint, and of all the vows and<br>observances that I have gone through. This, indeed, is the highest boon<br>thou hast granted me for thou hast shown thyself to me today. O Eternal<br>Lord, Thou, O holy one, hast the universe for thy eye. Thou art the Lion.<br>Thy form is identifiable with everything. Possessed of puissance, thou, O<br>Lord, art vast and infinite.<br><br>Bhishma continued, 'Having thus shown Himself unto Narada, the son of<br>Parameshthi, the great God addressed that ascetic and said,&#8212;Go hence, O<br>Narada, and do not delay! These worshippers of mine, possessed of lunar<br>complexions, are divested of all senses and do not subsist upon any kind<br>of food. They are, again, all Emancipate; with minds wholly concentrated<br>upon Me, people should think of Me. Such worshippers will never meet with<br>any impediments. These men are all crowned with ascetic success and are<br>highly blessed. In ancient times they became entirely devoted to me. They<br>have been freed from the attributes of Rajas and Tamas. Without doubt,<br>they are competent to enter me and become merged into my Self.&#8212;He that<br>cannot be seen with the eye, touched with the sense of touch, smelt with<br>the sense of scent, and that is beyond the ken of the sense of taste. He<br>whom the three attributes of Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas do not touch, who<br>pervades all things and is the one Witness of the universe, and who is<br>described as the Soul of the entire universe; He who is not destroyed<br>upon the destruction of the bodies of all created things, who is unborn<br>and unchangeable and eternal, who is freed from all attributes, who is<br>indivisible and entire; He who transcends the twice twelve topics of<br>enquiry and is regarded the Twenty-fifth, who is called by the name of<br>Purusha, who is inactive, and who is said to be apprehended by Knowledge<br>alone, He into whom the foremost of the regenerate persons enter and<br>become emancipate. He who is the eternal Supreme Soul and is known by the<br>name of Vasudeva. Behold, O Narada, the greatness and puissance of God.<br>He is never touched by acts good or bad. Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas, are<br>said to be the three (original) attributes. These dwell and act in the<br>bodies of all creatures. The Jiva-soul, called Kshetrajna, enjoys and<br>endorse the action of these three attributes. He, however, transcends<br>them and they cannot touch Him. Freed from these attributes, He is again<br>their enjoyer and endorser. Having created them Himself, He is above them<br>all. O celestial Rishi, the Earth, which is the refuge of the universe,<br>disappears[1830] (when the hour for universal dissolution comes) into<br>water, Water disappears into Light, and Light into Wind, Wind disappears<br>into Space, and Space into Mind. Mind is a great creature, and it<br>disappears into Unmanifest Prakriti. Unmanifest Prakriti, O Brahmana,<br>disappears into inactive Purusha. There is nothing higher than Purusha<br>which is Eternal. There is nothing among mobile and immobile things in<br>the universe that is immutable, except Vasudeva, the eternal Purusha.<br>Endued with great puissance, Vasudeva is the Soul of all creatures.<br>Earth, Wind, Space, Water, and Light forming the fifth, the primal<br>elements of great puissance. Mingling together they form what is called<br>the body. Possessed of subtile prowess and invisible to all eyes, O<br>Brahmana, the puissant Vasudeva then enter that combination of the five<br>primal elements, called body. Such entrance is called his birth, and<br>taking birth. He causes the body to move about and act. Without a<br>combination of the five primal elements, no body can ever be formed.<br>Without, again, the entrance of Jiva into the body, the mind dwelling<br>within it cannot cause it to move and act. He that enters the body is<br>possessed of great puissance and is called Jiva. He is known also by<br>other names, viz., Sesha and Sankarshana. He that takes his rise, from<br>that Sankarshana, by his own acts, Sanatkumara, and in whom all creatures<br>merge when the universal dissolution comes, is the Mind of all creatures<br>and is called by the name of Pradyumna. From Him (i.e., Pradyumna),<br>arises He who is the Creator, and who is both Cause and Effect. From this<br>last, everything, viz., the mobile and immobile universe, takes its rise.<br>This one is called Aniruddha. He is otherwise called Isana, and He is<br>manifest in all acts.[1831] That illustrious one, viz., Vasudeva, who is<br>called Kshetrajna, and who is freed from attributes, should, O king of<br>kings, be known as the puissant Sankarshana, when he takes birth as<br>Jiva.[1832] From Sankarshana arises Pradyumna who is called 'He that is<br>born as Mind.' From Pradyumna is He who is Aniruddha. He is<br>Consciousness, He is Iswara (Supreme Lord). It is from me, that the<br>entire mobile and immobile universe springs. It is from me, O Narada,<br>that the indestructible and destructible, the existent and the<br>non-existent, flow. They that are devoted to me enter into me and become<br>emancipate. I am known as Purusha. Without acts, I am the Twenty-fifth.<br>Transcending attributes, I am entire and indivisible. I am above all<br>pairs of opposite attributes and freed from all attachments. This, O<br>Narada, thou wilt fail to understand. Thou beholdest me as endued with a<br>form. In a moment, if the wish arises, I can dissolve this form. I am the<br>Supreme Lord and the Preceptor of the universe. That which thou beholdest<br>of me, O Narada, is only an illusion of mine. I now seem to be endued<br>with the attributes of all created things. Thou art not competent to know<br>me. I have disclosed to thee duly my quadruple form. I am, O Narada, the<br>Doer, I am Cause, and I am Effect. I am the sum-total of all living<br>creatures. All living creatures have their refuge in me. Let not the<br>thought be thine that thou hast seen the Kshetrajna. I pervade all<br>things. O Brahmana, and am the Jiva-Soul of all creatures. When the<br>bodies of all creatures, however, are destroyed, I am not destroyed.<br>Those highly blessed men who, having won ascetic success, become wholly<br>devoted to me, become freed from the attributes of both Rajas and Tamas<br>and succeeds, on that account, in entering me, O great ascetic. He who is<br>called Hiranyagarbha, who is the beginning of the world, who has four<br>faces, who cannot be understood with the aid of Nirukta, who is otherwise<br>called Brahman, who is an eternal deity, is employed in attending to many<br>of my concerns. The deity Rudra, born of my wrath, is sprung from my<br>forehead. Behold, the eleven Rudras are swelling (with might) on the<br>right side of my body. The twelve Adityas are on the left side of my<br>body. Behold, the eight Vasus, those foremost of deities, are in my<br>front, and see, Nasatya and Dasra, those two celestial physicians (Aswini<br>Kumars), are in my rear. Behold also in my body all the Prajapatis and<br>behold the seven Rishis also. Behold also the Vedas, and all the<br>Sacrifices numbering by hundreds, the Amrita (nectar), and all the<br>(medicinal) herbs and plants, and Penances, and vows and observances of<br>diverse kinds. Behold also in me the eight attributes indicative of<br>puissance, viz., those particularly called the attributes of Lordship,<br>all dwelling together in my body in their united and embodied form.<br>Behold also Sree and Lakshmi, and Kirti, and the Earth with her hump as<br>also the goddess, Saraswati, that mother of the Vedas, dwelling in me.<br>Behold, O Narada, Dhruva, that foremost of luminaries ranging the<br>firmament, as also all the Oceans those receptacles of water, and lakes,<br>and rivers, dwelling in me. Behold also, O best of men, the four foremost<br>ones amongst the Pitris in their embodied forms, as also, the three<br>attributes (of Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas) which are formless dwelling in<br>me. The acts done in honour of the Pitris are superior (in point of<br>merit) to those done in honour of the deities. I am the Pitri of both the<br>deities and the Pitris, and am existing from the beginning (that is, from<br>a time when they were not). Becoming the Equine-head I rove through the<br>Western and the Northern ocean and drink sacrificial libations duly<br>poured with mantras and solid sacrificial food offered with reverence and<br>devotion. In days of yore I created Brahman who himself adored me in<br>sacrifices. Gratified with him on that account I granted him many<br>excellent boons. I said unto him that in the beginning of the Kalpa he<br>would be born unto me as my son, and the sovereignty of all the worlds<br>would vest on him, coupled with diverse names being bestowed on diverse<br>objects in consequence of the starting of Ahankara into existence.[1833]<br>I also told him that none would ever violate the limits and boundaries he<br>would assign (for the observance of creatures) and, further, that he<br>would be the giver of boons unto persons that would (in sacrifices and by<br>proper acts) solicit him for them. I further assured him that he would be<br>an object of adoration with all the deities and Asuras, all the Rishis<br>and Pitris, and the diverse creatures forming the creation. I also gave<br>him to understand that I would always manifest myself for accomplishing<br>the business of the deities and that for that matter I would suffer<br>myself to be commanded by him even as a son by his sire.[1834] Granting<br>these and other highly agreeable boons unto Brahman of immeasurable<br>energy in consequence of my being gratified with him I (once more)<br>adopted the course dictated by Nivritti. The highest Nivritti is<br>identical with the annihilation of all duties and acts. Hence, by<br>adopting Nivritti one should conduct oneself in complete felicity.<br>Learned preceptors, with settled convictions deducted from the truths of<br>the Sankhya philosophy, have spoken of me as Kapila endued with the<br>puissance of Knowledge, dwelling within the effulgence of Surya, and<br>concentrated in Yoga.[1835] In Chcchandas (Vedas) I have been repeatedly<br>hymned as the illustrious Hiranyagarbha. In the Yoga scriptures, O<br>Brahmana, I have been spoken of as one who takes a delight in Yoga. I am<br>eternal. Assuming a form that is manifest, I dwell, at present, in the<br>heavens. At the end of a thousand Yugas I shall once more with-draw the<br>universe into myself. Having withdrawn all creatures, mobile and immobile<br>into myself, I shall exist all alone with knowledge only for my<br>companion. After the lapse of ages I shall again create the universe,<br>with the aid of that knowledge. That which is my fourth form creates the<br>indestructible Sesha. That Sesha is called by the name of Sankarshana.<br>Sankarshana creates Pradyumna. From Pradyumna I take birth myself as<br>Aniruddha. I create (myself) repeatedly. From Aniruddha springs Brahman.<br>The latter takes birth from Aniruddha's navel. From Brahman spring all<br>creatures mobile and immobile. Know that Creation springs in this way<br>repeatedly at the beginning of every Kalpa. Creation and destruction<br>succeed each other even as sunrise and sunset in this world. Then, again,<br>as Time, endued with immeasurable energy, forcibly brings back the Sun<br>after his disappearance, after the same manner I shall, assuming the form<br>of boar and putting forth my strength, bring back the Earth with her belt<br>of seas to her own position for the good of all creatures when she<br>becomes submerged in water. I shall then slay the son of Diti, named<br>Hiranyaksha, filled with pride of strength.[1836] Assuming the form then<br>of a Man-lion (Narsingha), I shall, for benefiting the deities, slay<br>Hiranyakasipu the son of Diti, who will be a great destroyer of<br>sacrifices. Unto Virochana (the son of Prahlada) will be born a mighty<br>son of the name of Vali. That great Asura will be unslayable in the whole<br>universe consisting of deities, Asuras and Rakshasas. He will hurl Sakra<br>from the sovereignty of the universe. When after routing the Lord of<br>Sachi, that Asura will take unto himself the sovereignty of the three<br>worlds, I shall take birth in Aditi's womb, by Kasyapa, as the twelfth<br>Aditya. I shall (taking the sovereignty of the three worlds Vali) restore<br>it to Indra of immeasurable splendour, and replace the deities, O Narada,<br>in their respective stations. As regards Vali, that foremost of Danavas,<br>who is to be unslayable by all the deities, I shall cause him to dwell in<br>the nether regions. In the Treta age I shall take birth as Rama in the<br>race of Bhrigu, and exterminate the Kshatriyas who will become proud of<br>their strength and possessions. Towards the close of Treta and the<br>beginning of Dwapara, I shall take birth as Rama, the son of Dasaratha in<br>Iskshaku's royal line. At that time, the two Rishis viz., the two sons of<br>Prajapati, called by the names of Ekata and Dwita, will in consequence of<br>the injury done by them unto their brother Trita, have to take birth as<br>apes, losing the beauty of the human form. Those apes that shall take<br>birth in the race of Ekata and Dwita, shall become endued with great<br>strength and mighty energy and will equal Sakra himself in prowess. All<br>those apes, O regenerate one, will become my allies for accomplishing the<br>business of the deities. I shall then slay the terrible lord of the<br>Rakshasas, that wretch of Pulastya's race, viz., the fierce Ravana, that<br>throne of all the worlds, together with all his children and followers.<br>Towards the close of the Dwapara and beginning of the Kali ages, I shall<br>again appear in the world taking birth in the city of Mathura for the<br>purpose of slaying Kansa. There, after slaying innumerable Danavas that<br>will be thorns in the side of the deities, I shall take up my residence<br>in Kusasthali at the city of Dwaraka. While residing in that city I shall<br>slay the Asura Naraka, the son of 'the Earth,&#8212;him, that is, who will do<br>an injury to Aditi, as also some 'other Danavas of the names of Muru and<br>Pitha. Slaying also another foremost of Danavas, viz., the lord of<br>Pragjyotisha, I shall transplant his delightful city furnished with<br>diverse kinds of wealth into Dwaraka. I shall then subjugate the two gods<br>worshipped of all the deities, viz., Maheshwara and Mahasena, who will<br>become fond of the Danava Vana and do him diverse good offices and who<br>will exert themselves vigorously for that worshipper of theirs.[1837]<br>Vanquishing next the son of the Danava Vali, viz., Vana, who will be<br>endued with a thousand arms, I shall next destroy all the inhabitants of<br>the Danava city called Saubha.[1838] I shall next, O foremost of<br>Brahmanas, compass the death of Kalayavana, a Danava who will be endued<br>with great might in consequence of his being equipt with the energy of<br>Gargya.[1839] A proud Asura will appear as a king at Girivraja, of the<br>name of Jarasandha, who will quarrel with all the other kings of the<br>world. His death will be compassed by me through some one else guided by<br>my intelligence. I shall next slay Sisupala in the sacrifice of king<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, which sacrifice all the kings of the<br>world will bring tribute. In some of these feats, only Arjuna, the son of<br>Vasava, will become my assistant. I shall establish Yudhishthira with all<br>his brothers in his ancestral kingdom. People will call me and Arjuna as<br>Narayana and Nara, when, endued with puissance, we two, exerting our<br>strength, shall consume a large number of Kshatriyas, for doing good to<br>the world. Having lightened the burthen of the Earth according to our<br>pleasure, I shall absorb all the principal Sattwatas as also Dwaraka, my<br>favourite city, into my own self, recollecting my all-embracing<br>Knowledge. Endued with four forms, I shall, in this way, achieve many<br>feats of great prowess, and attain at last to those regions of felicity<br>created by me and honoured by all the Brahmanas. Appearing in the forms<br>of a swan, a tortoise, a fish, O foremost of regenerate ones, I shall<br>then display myself as a boar, then as a Man-lion (Nrisingha), then as a<br>dwarf, then as Rama of Bhrigu's race, then as Rama, the son of Dasaratha,<br>then as Krishna the scion of the Sattwata race, and lastly as Kalki. When<br>the auditions in the Vedas disappeared from the world, I brought them<br>back. The Vedas with the auditions in them, were re-created by me in the<br>Krita age. They have once more disappeared or may only be partially heard<br>here and there in the Puranas. Many of my best appearances also in the<br>world have become events of the past. Having achieved the good of the<br>worlds in those forms in which I appeared, they have re-entered into my<br>own Prakriti. Brahman (the Creator) himself never obtained a sight of me<br>in this form of mine, which thou, O Narada, hast seen today in<br>consequence of thy entire devotion to me. I have now said everything, O<br>Brahmana,&#8212;unto thee that art devoted to me wholly, I have disclosed to<br>thee my ancient appearances and future ones also, O Best of men, together<br>with all their mysteries. "Bhishma continued, The holy and illustrious<br>deity, of universal and immutable form, having said these words unto<br>Narada, disappeared there and then. Narada also, endued with great<br>energy, having obtained the high favour that he had solicited, then<br>proceeded with great speed to the retreat called Vadari, for beholding<br>Nara and Narayana. This great Upanishad, perfectly consist with the four<br>Vedas, in harmony with Sankhya-yoga, and called by him by the name of the<br>Pancharatra scriptures, and recited by Narayana himself with his own<br>mouth, was repeated by Narada in the presence of many hearers in the<br>abode of Brahman (his sire) in exactly the same way in which Narayana<br>(while that great god had showed himself unto him) had recited it, and in<br>which he had heard it from his own lips.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Was not Brahman, the Creator of all things,<br>acquainted with this wonderful narrative of the glory of Narayana endued<br>with intelligence that he heard it from the lips of Narada? Is the<br>illustrious Grandsire of all the worlds any way different from or<br>inferior to the great Narayana? How then is it that he was unacquainted<br>with the puissance of Narayana of immeasurable energy?'<br><br>Bhishma continued, 'Hundreds and thousands of great-Kalpas, hundreds and<br>thousands of Creation and Dissolutions, O king of kings, have been over<br>and have become incidents of the past.[1840] In the beginning of every<br>cycle of Creation, Brahman, endued with great puissance and who creates<br>all things, is remembered (by Narayana). Brahman knows well, O king, that<br>Narayana, that foremost of all gods is very much superior to him. He<br>knows that Narayana is the Supreme Soul, that he is the Supreme Lord,<br>that He is the Creator of Brahman himself. It was only unto that conclave<br>of Rishis, crowned with ascetic success, that came to the abode of<br>Brahman, that Narada recited his narrative which is a very ancient one,<br>and which is perfectly consistent with the Vedas. The deity Surya, having<br>heard that narrative from those Rishis crowned with ascetic<br>success,[1841] repeated it to the six and sixty thousands of Rishis, O<br>king, of cleansed souls, that follow in his train. And Surya, the deity<br>that imparts heat unto all worlds, repeated that narrative unto those<br>Beings also, of cleansed souls, that have been created (by Brahman) for<br>always journeying in the van of Surya.[1842] The high-souled Rishis that<br>follow in Surya's train, O son, repeated that excellent narrative unto<br>the deities assembled on the breast of Meru. That best of ascetics, viz.,<br>the regenerate Asita, then having heard the narrative from the deities,<br>repeated it unto the Pitris, O king of kings. I heard it from my sire<br>Santanu, O son, who recited it to me formerly. Myself having heard it<br>from my sire. I have repeated it to thee, O Bharata. Deities and Munis,<br>who have heard this excellent old narrative, which is a Purana&#8212;all adore<br>the Supreme Soul. This narrative, belonging to the Rishis and thus handed<br>down from one to another, should not, O king, be communicated by thee to<br>any one that is not a worshipper of Vasudeva. This narrative, O king, is<br>really the essence of the hundreds of other narratives that thou hast<br>heard from me. In days of yore, O monarch, the deities and the Asuras,<br>uniting together, churned the Ocean and t wised the Amrita. After the<br>same manner, the Brahmanas, uniting together in days of yore, churned all<br>the scriptures and raised this narrative which resembles nectar. He who<br>frequently reads this narrative, and he who frequently listens to it,<br>with concentrated attention, in a retired spot, and filled with devotion,<br>succeeds in becoming a denizen, possessed of lunar complexion, of the<br>spacious island known by the name of White Island. Without doubt, such a<br>man succeeds in entering into Narayana of a thousand rays. A sick person,<br>by listening to this narrative from the beginning, becomes freed from his<br>illness. The man that simply desires to read or listen to this narrative<br>obtains the fruition of all his wishes. To devoted worshipper, by reading<br>or listening to it, attains to the high end that is reserved for devoted<br>worshippers. Thou also, O monarch, shouldst always adore and worship that<br>foremost of all Beings. He is the father and the mother of all creatures,<br>and He is an object of reverence with the entire universe. Let the<br>illustrious and Eternal God of the Brahmans, viz., Janarddana of high<br>intelligence, be gratified with thee, O Yudhishthira of mighty arms!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having listened to the best of narratives, O<br>Janamejaya, king Yudhishthira the just and all his brothers became<br>devoted to Narayana. And all of them, O Bharata, betaking themselves to<br>the practice of silently meditating upon Narayana (from that day),<br>uttered these words for His glorification, viz., 'Victory to that holy<br>and illustrious Being.' He, again, who is our best of preceptors, viz.,<br>the Island-born Krishna, devoted to penances, sung uttering the word<br>Narayana that high mantra which is worthy of being recited in silence.<br>Sojourning through the welkin to the Ocean of Milk which is always the<br>abode of nectar, and worshipping the great God there, he came back to his<br>own hermitage.<br><br>"Bhishma continued, '1 have now repeated to thee the narrative that was<br>recited by Narada (unto the conclave of Rishis assembled in the abode of<br>Brahman). That narrative has descended from one person to another from<br>very ancient times. I heard it from my sire who formerly repeated it to<br>me.'"<br><br>Suta continued, I have now told you all that Vaisampayana recited to<br>Janamejaya. Having listened to Vaisampayana's narration, king Janamejaya<br>properly discharged all his duties according to the ordinances laid down<br>in the scriptures. Ye have all undergo very severe penances and observed<br>many high and excellent vows. Residing in this sacred forest that is<br>known by the name of Naimisha, ye are foremost of all persons conversant<br>with the Vedas. Ye foremost of regenerate ones, ye all have come to this<br>great sacrifice of Saunaka. Do ye all adore and worship that Eternal and<br>Supreme Lord of the universe in excellent sacrifices, properly pouring<br>libations of clarified butter into the fire with the aid of mantras and<br>dedicating the same unto Narayana. As regards myself, I heard this<br>excellent narrative that has descended from generation to gene-ration,<br>from my sire who recited it to me in former times.
