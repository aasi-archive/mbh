                            "Bhishma said, 'The king, O Yudhishthira, should always be ready for<br>action. That king is not worth of praise who, like a woman, is destitute<br>of exertion. In this connection, the holy Usanas has sting a Sloka, O<br>monarch. Listen to it with attention, O king, as I recite it to thee:<br>'Like a snake swallowing up mice, the earth swallows tip these two, the<br>king that is averse to battle and the Brahmana that is exceedingly<br>attached to wives and children.[163] It behoveth thee, O tiger among<br>kings, to bear this always in thy heart. Make peace with those foes with<br>whom (according to the ordinance) peace should be made, and wage war with<br>them with whom war should be waged. Be he thy preceptor or be he thy<br>friend, he that acts inimically towards thy kingdom consisting of seven<br>limbs, should be slain.[164] There is an ancient Sloka sung by king<br>Marutta, agreeable to Vrihaspati's opinion, O monarch, about the duty of<br>kings. According to the eternal provision, there is punishment for even<br>the preceptor if he becomes haughty and disregardful of what should be<br>done and what should not, and if he transgresses all restraints. Jadu's<br>son, king Sagara, of great intelligence, from desire of doing good to the<br>citizens, exiled his own eldest son Asamanjas. Asamanjas, O king, used to<br>drown the children of the citizens in the Sarayu. His sire, therefore,<br>rebuked him and sent him to exile. The Rishi Uddalaka cast off his<br>favourite son Swetaketu (afterwards) of rigid penances, because the<br>latter used to invite Brahmanas with deceptive promises of entertainment.<br>The happiness of their subjects, observance of truth, and sincerity of<br>behaviour are the eternal duty of kings. The king should not covet the<br>wealth of others. He should in time give what should be given, If the<br>king becomes possessed of prowess, truthful in speech, and forgiving in<br>temper, he would never fall away from prosperity. With soul cleansed of<br>vices, the king should be able to govern his wrath, and all his<br>conclusions should be conformable to the scriptures. He should also<br>always pursue morality and profit and pleasure and salvation<br>(judiciously). The king should always conceal his counsels in respect of<br>these three, (viz., morality, profit, and pleasure). No greater evil can<br>befall the king than the disclosure of his counsels. Kings should protect<br>the four orders in the discharge of their duties. It is the eternal duty<br>of kings to prevent a confusion of duties in respect of the different<br>orders. The king should not repose confidence (on others than his own<br>servants), nor should he repose full confidence (on even his servants).<br>He should, by his own intelligence, took after the merits and defects of<br>the six essential requisites of sovereignty.[165] The king who is<br>observant of the laches of his foes, and judicious in the pursuit of<br>morality, profit, and pleasure, who sets clever spies for ascertaining<br>secrets and seeks to wean away the officers of his enemies by presents of<br>wealth, deserves applause. The king should administer justice like Yama<br>and amass wealth like Kuvera. He should also be observant of the merits<br>and defects of his own acquisitions and losses and of his own dominions.<br>He should feed those that have not been fed, and enquire after those that<br>have been fed. Possessed of sweet speech, he could speak with a smiling<br>(and not with a sour) countenance. He should always wait upon those that<br>are old in years and repress procrastination. He should never covet what<br>belongs to others. He should firmly follow the behaviour of the righteous<br>and, therefore, observe that behaviour carefully. He should never take<br>wealth from those that are righteous. Taking the wealth of those that are<br>not righteous he should give it unto them that are righteous. The king<br>should himself be skilful in smiting. He should practise liberality. He<br>Should have his soul under control. He should dress himself with<br>splendour. He should make gifts in season and regular in his meals. He<br>should also be of good behaviour. The king desirous of obtaining<br>prosperity should always bind to his service men that are brave, devoted,<br>incapable of being deceived by foes,[166] well-born, healthy,<br>well-behaved, and connected with families that are well-behaved,<br>respectable, never inclined to insult others, conversant with all the<br>sciences, possessing a knowledge of the world and its affairs, unmindful<br>of the future state of existence, always observant of their duties,<br>honest, and steadfast like mountains. There should be no difference<br>between him and them as regards objects of enjoyment. The only<br>distinction should consist in his umbrella and his power or passing<br>orders. His conduct towards them, before or behind, should be the same.<br>The king who behaves in this way never comes to grief. That crooked and<br>covetous king who suspects everybody and who taxes his subjects heavily,<br>is soon deprived of life by his own servants and relatives. That king,<br>however, who is of righteous behaviour and who is ever engaged in<br>attracting the hearts of his people, never sinks when attacked by foes.<br>If overcome, he soon regains his position. If the king is not wrathful,<br>if he is not addicted to evil practices and not severe in his<br>punishments, if he succeeds in keeping his passions under control, he<br>then becomes an object of confidence unto all like the Himavat mountains<br>(unto all creatures). He is the best of kings who hath wisdom, who is<br>possessed of liberality, who is ready to take advantage of the laches of<br>foes, who has agreeable features, who is conversant with what is bad for<br>each of the four orders of his subjects, who is prompt in action, who has<br>his wrath under control, who is not vindictive, who is high-minded, who<br>is not irascible by disposition, who is equal engaged in sacrifices and<br>other religious acts, who is not given to boasting, and who vigorously<br>prosecutes to completion all works commenced by him. He is the best of<br>kings in whose dominions men live fearlessly like sons in the house of<br>their sire. He is the best of kings whose subjects have not to hide their<br>wealth and are conversant with what is good and what is bad for them. He,<br>indeed, is a king whose subjects are engaged in their respective duties<br>and do not fear to cast off their bodies when duty calls for it; whose<br>people, protected duly, are all of peaceful behaviour, obedient, docile,<br>tractable, unwilling to be engaged in disputes, and inclined to<br>liberality. That king earns eternal merit in whose dominions there is no<br>wickedness and dissimulation and deception and envy. That king truly<br>deserves to rule who honours knowledge, who is devoted to the scriptures<br>and the good of his people, who treads in the path of the righteous, and<br>who is liberal. That king deserves to rule, whose spies and counsels and<br>acts, accomplished and unaccomplished, remain unknown to his enemies. The<br>following verse was sung in days of old by Usanas of Bhrigu's race, in<br>the narrative called Ramacharita, on the subject, O Bharata, of kingly<br>duties: 'One should first select a king (in whose dominions to live).<br>Then should he select a wife, and then earn wealth. If there be no king,<br>what would become of his wife and acquisition'?' Regarding those that are<br>desirous of kingdom, there is no other eternal duty more obligatory than<br>the protection (of subjects). The protection the king grants to his<br>subjects upholds the world.[167] Manu, the son of Prachetas, sang these<br>two verses respecting the duties of kings. Listen to them with attention:<br>'These six persons should be avoided like a leaky boat on the sea, viz.,<br>a preceptor that does not speak, a priest that has not studied the<br>scriptures, a king that does not grant protection, a wife that utters<br>what is disagreeable, a cow-herd that likes to rove within the village,<br>and a barber that is desirous of going to the woods.'"[168]
