                            "Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative of the<br>discourse that took place between Narada and Asita-Devala. Once on a time<br>Narada, beholding that foremost of intelligent men, viz., Devala of<br>venerable years, seated at his ease, questioned him about the origin and<br>the destruction of all creatures.'<br><br>"Narada said, 'Whence, O Brahmana, hath this universe, consisting of<br>mobile and immobile objects, been created? When again doth the<br>all-embracing destruction come, into whom doth it merge? Let thy learned<br>self discourse to me on this.'<br><br>"Asita said, 'Those from which the Supreme Soul, when the time comes,<br>moved by the desire of existence in manifold, forms, creates all<br>creatures, are said by persons conversant with objects to be the five<br>great essences.[1309] (After this) Time, impelled by the Understanding<br>creates other objects from those (five primal essences).'[1310] He that<br>says that there is anything else besides these (i.e., the five primal<br>essences, Kala, and the Understanding), says what is not true. Know, O<br>Narada, that these five are eternal, indestructible, and without<br>beginning and without end. With Kala as their sixth, these five primal<br>essences are naturally possessed of mighty energy. Water, Space, Earth,<br>Wind, and Heat,&#8212;these are those five essences. Without doubt, there is<br>nothing higher or superior to these (in point of puissance or energy).<br>The existence of nothing else (than five) can be affirmed by any one<br>agreeably to the conclusions derivable from the Srutis or arguments drawn<br>from reason. If any one does assert the existence of anything else, then<br>his assertion would verily be idle or vain. Know that these six enter<br>into the production of all effects. That of which are all these (which<br>thou perceivest) is called Asat.[1311] These five, and Kala (or Jiva),<br>the potencies of past acts, and ignorance,&#8212;these eight eternal essences<br>are the causes of the birth and destruction of all creatures.[1312] When<br>creatures are destroyed it is into these that they enter; and when they<br>take birth, it is again from them they do so. Indeed, after destruction,<br>a creature resolves itself into those five primal essences. His body is<br>made of earth; his ear has its origin in space; his eye hath light for<br>its cause; his life (motion) is of wind, and his blood is of water,<br>without doubt. The two eyes, the nose, the two ears, the skin, and the<br>tongue (constituting the fifth), are the senses. These, the learned know,<br>exist for perception of their respective objects.[1313] Vision, hearing,<br>smelling, touching, and tasting are the functions of the senses. The five<br>senses are concerned with five objects in five ways. Know, by the<br>inference of reason, their similitude of attributes.[1314] Form, scent,<br>taste, touch, and sound, are the five properties that are (respectively)<br>apprehended by the five senses in five different ways. These five<br>properties, viz., form, scent, taste, touch, and sound, are not really<br>apprehended by the _senses_ (for these are inert), but it is the Soul<br>that apprehends them _through_ the senses. That which is called Chitta is<br>superior to the multitude of senses. Superior to Chitta is Manas.<br>Superior to Manas is Buddhi, and superior to Buddhi is Kshetrajna.[1315]<br>At first a living creature perceives different objects through the<br>senses. With Manas he reflects over them, and then with the aid of Buddhi<br>he arrives at certitude of knowledge. Possessed of Buddhi, one arrives at<br>certainty of conclusions in respect of objects perceived through the<br>senses. The five senses, Chitta, Mind and Understanding (which is the<br>eighth in the tale),&#8212;these are regarded as organs of knowledge by those<br>conversant with the science of Adhyatma. The hands, the feet, the anal<br>duct, the membrum virile, the mouth (forming the fifth in the tale),<br>constitute the five organs of action. The mouth is spoken of as an organ<br>of action because it contains the apparatus of speech, and that of<br>eating. The feet are organs of locomotion and the hands for doing various<br>kinds of work. The anal duct and the membrum, virile are two organs that<br>exist for a similar purpose, viz., for evacuation. The first is for<br>evacuation of stools, the second for that of urine as also of the vital<br>seed when one feels the influence of desire. Besides these, there is a<br>sixth organ of action. It is called muscular power. These then are the<br>names of the six organs of action according to the (approved) treatises<br>bearing on the subject. I have now mentioned to thee the names of all the<br>organs of knowledge and of action, and all the attributes of the five<br>(primal) essences.[1316] When in consequence of the organs being<br>fatigued, they cease to perform their respective functions, the owner of<br>those organs, because of their suspension, is said to sleep. If, when the<br>functions of these organs are suspended, the functions of the mind do not<br>cease, but on the other hand the mind continues to concern itself with<br>its objects, the condition of consciousness is called Dream. During<br>wakefulness there are three states of the mind, viz., that connected with<br>Goodness, that with Passion, and that with Darkness. In dream also the<br>mind becomes concerned with the same three states. Those very states,<br>when they appear in dreams, connected with pleasurable actions, come to<br>be regarded with applause. Happiness, success, knowledge, and absence of<br>attachment are the indications of (the wakeful man in whom is present)<br>the attribute of Goodness. Whatever states (of Goodness, Passion, or<br>Darkness) are experienced by living creatures, as exhibited in acts,<br>during their hours of Wakefulness, reappear in memory during their hours<br>of steep when they dream. The passage of our notions as they exist during<br>wakefulness into those of dreams, and that of notions as they exist in<br>dreams into those of wakefulness, become directly apprehensible in that<br>state of consciousness which is called dreamless slumber. That is<br>eternal, and that is desirable.[1317] There are five organs of knowledge,<br>and five of actions; with muscular power, mind, understanding, and<br>Chitta, and with also the three attributes of Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas,<br>the tale, it has been said, comes up to seventeen. The eighteenth in the<br>enumeration is he who owneth the body, Indeed, he who lives in this body<br>is eternal. All those seventeen (with Avidya or Ignorance making<br>eighteen), dwelling in the body, exist attached to him who owns the body.<br>When the owner disappears from the body, those eighteen (counting Avidya)<br>cease to dwell together in the body. Or, this body made up of the five<br>(primal) essences is only a combination (that must dissolve away). The<br>eighteen attributes (including Avidya), with him that owneth the body,<br>and counting stomachic heat numbering twentieth in the tale, form that<br>which is known as the Combination of the Five. There is a Being called<br>Mahat, which, with the aid of the wind (called Prana), upholds this<br>combination containing the twenty things that have been named, and in the<br>matter of the destruction of that body the wind (which is generally<br>spoken of as the cause) is only the instrument in the hands of that same<br>Mahat. Whatever creature is born is resolved once more into the five<br>constituent elements upon the exhaustion of his merits and demerits; and<br>urged again by the merits and demerits won in that life enters into<br>another body resulting from his acts.[1318] His abodes always resulting<br>from Avidya, desire, and acts, he migrates from body to body, abandoning<br>one after another repeatedly, urged on by Time, like a person abandoning<br>house after house in succession. They that are wise, and endued with<br>certainty of knowledge, do not give way to grief upon beholding this<br>(migration). Only they that are foolish, erroneously supposing<br>relationships (where relationship in reality there is none) indulge in<br>grief at sight of such changes of abode. This Jiva is no one's relation;<br>there is none again that may be said to belong to him. He is always<br>alone, and he himself creates his own body and his own happiness and<br>misery. This Jiva is never born, nor doth he ever die. Freed from the<br>bond of body, he succeeds sometimes in attaining to the highest end.<br>Deprived of body, because freed through the exhaustion of acts from<br>bodies that are the results of merits and demerits, Jiva at last attains<br>to Brahma. For the exhaustion of both merits and demerits, Knowledge has<br>been ordained as the cause in the Sankhya school. Upon the exhaustion of<br>merit and demerit, when Jiva attains to the status of Brahma,[1319] (they<br>that are learned in the scriptures) behold (with the eye of the<br>scriptures) the attainment of Jiva to the highest end.'"
