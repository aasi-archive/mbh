                            "Yudhishthira said, 'How wonderful is this, O thou of immeasurable<br>prowess, that thou art rapt in meditation! O great refuge of the<br>universe, is it all right with the three worlds? When thou hast, O God,<br>withdrawn thyself (from the world), having, O bull among men, adopted the<br>fourth, state, my mind has been filled with wonder.[135] The five<br>life-breaths that act within the body have been controlled by thee into<br>stillness. Thy delighted senses thou hast concentrated within thy mind.<br>Both speech and mind, O Govinda, have been concentrated within thy<br>understanding. All thy senses, indeed, have been withdrawn into thy<br>soul.[136] The hair on thy body stands erect. Thy mind and understanding<br>are both still. Thou art as immobile now, O Madhava, as a wooden post or<br>a stone. O illustrious God, thou art as still as the flame of a lamp<br>burning in a place where there is no wind. Thou art as immobile as a mass<br>of rock. If I am fit to hear the cause, if it is no secret of thine,<br>dispel, O god, my doubt for I beg of thee and solicit it as a favour.<br>Thou art the Creator and thou art the Destroyer. Thou art destructible<br>and thou art indestructible. Thou art without beginning and thou art<br>without end. Thou art the first and the foremost of Beings. O foremost of<br>righteous persons, tell me the cause of this (Yoga) abstraction. I<br>solicit thy favour, and am thy devoted worshipper, and bow to thee,<br>bending my head.' Thus addressed, the illustrious younger brother of<br>Vasava, recalling his mind, understanding, and the senses to their usual<br>sphere, said these words with a soft smile.'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'That tiger among men, Bhishma, who is now lying on a bed<br>of arrows, and who is now like unto a fire that is about to go out, is<br>thinking of me. Hence my mind also was concentrated on him. My mind was<br>concentrated upon him, the twang of whose bowstring and the sound of<br>whose palms Indra himself was unable to bear. I was thinking of him who<br>having vanquished in a trice all the assembled kings (at the Self-choice<br>of the daughters of the king of Kasi) abducted the three princesses for<br>the marriage of his brother Vichitravirya. I was thinking of him who<br>fought continually for three and twenty days with Rama himself of<br>Bhrigu's race and whom Rama was unable to overcome. Collecting all his<br>senses and concentrating his mind by the aid of his understanding, he<br>sought my refuge (by thinking of me). It was for this that I had centered<br>my mind upon him. I was thinking of him whom Ganga conceived and brought<br>forth according to ordinary human laws and whom Vasishtha took as a<br>pupil. I was thinking of that hero of mighty energy and great<br>intelligence who possesses a knowledge of all the celestial weapons as<br>also of the four Vedas with all their branches. I was thinking of him, O<br>son of Pandu, who is the favourite disciple of Rama, the son of<br>Jamadagni, and who is the receptacle of the sciences. I was thinking of<br>that foremost of all persons conversant with morality and duty, of him, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, who knows the Past, the Future, and the Present.<br>After that tiger among kings shall have, in consequences of his own<br>achievements, ascended to heaven, the earth, O son of Pritha, will look<br>like a moonless night. Therefore, O Yudhishthira, submissively<br>approaching Ganga's son, viz., Bhishma of terrible prowess, question him<br>about what thou mayst desire to learn. O lord of the earth, enquire of<br>him about the four branches of knowledge (in respect of morality,<br>profit., pleasure and salvation), about the sacrifices and the rites laid<br>down for the four orders, about the four modes of life, and about the<br>kingly duties in full. When Bhishma, that foremost one of Kuru's race,<br>will disappear from the world, every kind of knowledge will disappear<br>with him. It is for this that I urge thee (to go to him now).' Hearing<br>these beneficial words of high import from Vasudeva, the righteous<br>Yudhishthira, with voice choked in tears, answered Janardana, saying,<br>'What thou hast said, O Madhava, about the eminence of Bhishma, is<br>perfectly true. I have not the slightest doubt regarding it. Indeed, I<br>had heard of the high blessedness, as also the greatness, of the<br>illustrious Bhishma from high-souled Brahmanas discoursing upon it. Thou,<br>O slayer of foes, art the Creator of all the worlds. There cannot,<br>therefore, O delighter of the Yadavas, be the slightest doubt in what<br>thou sayest. If thy heart be inclined to show grace, O Madhava, then we<br>shall go unto Bhishma with thyself at our head. When the divine Surya<br>shall have turned towards the north, Bhishma will leave (this world), for<br>those regions of bliss that he has won. That descendant of Kuru's race,<br>therefore, O mighty-armed one, deserves to have a sight of thee. (If thou<br>grantest my prayer), Bhishma will then obtain a sight of thee that art<br>the first of Gods, of thee that art destructible and indestructible.<br>Indeed, O lord, thou it is that art the vast receptacle of Brahma.'"<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of king Yudhishthira the<br>just, the slayer of Madhu addressed Satyaki who was sitting beside him,<br>saying, 'Let my car be yoked.' At this, Satyaki quickly left Kesava's<br>presence and going out, commanded Daruka, saying, 'Let Krishna's car be<br>made ready.' Hearing the words of Satyaki, Daruka speedily yoked<br>Krishna's car. That foremost of vehicles, adorned with gold, decked with<br>a profusion of emeralds, and moon-gems and sun-gems, furnished with<br>wheels covered with gold, possessed of effulgence, fleet as the wind, set<br>in the middle with diverse other kinds of jewels, beautiful as the<br>morning sun, equipped with a beautiful standard topped by Garuda, and gay<br>with numerous banners, had those foremost of steeds, fleet as thought,<br>viz., Sugriva and Saivya and the other two, in trappings of gold, yoked<br>unto it. Having yoked it, O tiger, among kings, Daruka, with joined<br>hands, informed Krishna of the fact.'
