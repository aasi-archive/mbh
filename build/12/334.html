                            "Bhishma said, 'Having spoken in this way (unto all things), the<br>regenerate Rishi of austere penances, viz., Suka, stayed on his success<br>casting off the four kinds of faults. Casting off also the eight kinds of<br>Tamas, he dismissed the five kinds of Rajas. Endued with great<br>intelligence, he then cast off the attribute of Sattwa. All this seemed<br>exceedingly wonderful. He then dwelt in that eternal station that is<br>destitute of attributes, freed from every indication, that is, in Brahma,<br>blazing like a smokeless fire. Meteors began to shoot. The points of the<br>compass seemed to be ablaze. The Earth trembled. All those phenomena<br>seemed exceedingly wonderful. The trees began to cast off their branches<br>and the mountains their summits. Loud-reports (as of thunder) were heard<br>that seemed to rive the Himavat mountains. The sun seemed at that moment<br>to be shorn of splendour. Fire refused to blaze forth. The lakes and<br>rivers and seas were all agitated. Vasava poured showers of rain of<br>excellent taste and fragrance. A pure breeze began to blow, bearing<br>excellent perfumes. Suka as he proceeded through the welkin, beheld two<br>beautiful summits, one belonging to Himavat and another to Meru. These<br>were in close contact with each other. One of them was made of gold and<br>was, therefore yellow; the other was white, being made of silver. Each of<br>them, O Bharata, was a hundred yojanas in height and of the same measure<br>in breadth. Indeed, as Suka journeyed towards the north, he saw those two<br>beautiful summits. With a fearless heart he dashed against those two<br>summits that were united with each other. Unable to bear the force, the<br>summits were suddenly rent in twain. The sight they thereupon presented,<br>O monarch, was exceedingly wonderful to behold. Suka pierced through<br>those summits, for they were unable to stop his onward course. At this a<br>loud noise arose in heaven, made by the denizens thereof. The Gandharvas<br>and the Rishis also and others that dwelt in that mountain being rent in<br>twain and Suka passing through it. Indeed, O Bharata, a loud noise was<br>heard everywhere at that moment, consisting of the words&#8212;Excellent,<br>Excellent!&#8212;He was adored by the Gandharvas and the Rishis, by crowds of<br>Yakshas and Rakshasas, and all tribes of the Vidyadharas. The entire<br>firmament became strewn with celestial flowers showered from heaven at<br>that moment when Suka thus pierced through that impenetrable barrier, O<br>monarch! The righteous-souled Suka then beheld from a high region the<br>celestial stream Mandakini of great beauty, running below through a<br>region adorned by many flowering groves and woods. In these waters many<br>beautiful Apsaras were sporting. Beholding Suka who was bodiless, those<br>unclad aerial beings felt shame. Learning that Suka had undertaken his<br>great journey, his sire Vyasa, filled with affection, followed him behind<br>along the same aerial path. Meanwhile Suka, proceeding through that<br>region of the firmament that is above the region of the wind displayed<br>his Yoga-prowess and identified himself with Brahma.[1788] Adopting the<br>subtile path of high Yoga, Vyasa of austere penances, reached within the<br>twinkling of the eye that spot whence Suka first undertook his journey.<br>Proceeding along the same way, Vyasa beheld the mountain summit rent in<br>twain and through which Suka has passed. Encountering the Island-born<br>ascetic, the Rishis began to represent to him the achievements of his<br>son. Vyasa, however, began to indulge in lamentations, loudly calling<br>upon his son by name and causing the three worlds to resound with the<br>noise he made. Meanwhile, the righteous-souled Suka, who had entered the<br>elements, had become their soul and acquired omnipresence, answered his<br>sire by uttering the monosyllable Bho in the form of an echo. At this,<br>the entire universe of mobile and immobile creatures, uttering the<br>monosyllable Bho, echoed the answer of Suka. From that time to this, when<br>sounds are uttered in mountain-caves or on mountain-breasts, the latter,<br>as if in answer to Suka still echo them (with the monosyllable Bho).<br>Having cast off all the attributes of sound, etc., and showing his<br>Yoga-prowess in the manner of his disappearance, Suka in this way<br>attained to the highest station. Beholding that glory and puissance of<br>his son of immeasurable energy, Vyasa sat down on the breast of the<br>mountain and began to think of his son with grief. The Apsaras were<br>sporting on the banks of the celestial stream Mandakini, seeing the Rishi<br>seated there, became all agitated with grave shame and lost heart. Some<br>of them, to hide their nudity, plunged into the stream, and some entered<br>the groves hard by, and some quickly took up their clothes, at beholding<br>the Rishi. (None of them had betrayed any signs of agitation at sight of<br>his son). The Rishi, beholding these movements, understood that his son<br>had been emancipated from all attachments, but that he himself was not<br>freed therefrom. At this he became filled with both joy and shame. As<br>Vyasa was seated there, the auspicious god Siva, armed with Pinaka,<br>surrounded on all sides by many deities and Gandharvas and adored by all<br>the great Rishis came thither. Consoling the Island-born Rishi who was<br>burning with grief on account of his son, Mahadeva said these words unto<br>him.&#8212;Thou hadst formerly solicited from me a son possessed of the energy<br>of Fire, of Water, of Wind, and of Space; Procreated by thy penances, the<br>son that was born unto thee was of that very kind. Proceeding from my<br>grace, he was pure and full of Brahma-energy. He has attained to the<br>highest end&#8212;an end which none can win that has not completely subjugated<br>his senses, nor can be won by even any of the deities. Why then, O<br>regenerate Rishi, dost thou grieve for that son? As long as the hills<br>will last, as long as the ocean will last, so long will the fame of thy<br>son endure undiminished! Through my grace, O great Rishi thou shalt<br>behold in this world a shadowy form resembling thy son, moving by the<br>side and never deserting thee for a single moment!&#8212;Thus favoured by the<br>illustrious Rudra himself, O Bharata, the Rishi beheld a shadow of his<br>son by his side. He returned from that place, filled with joy at this. I<br>have now told thee, O chief of Bharata's race, everything regarding the<br>birth and life of Suka about which thou hadst asked me. The celestial<br>Rishi Narada and the great Yogin Vyasa had repeatedly told all this to me<br>in days of yore when the subject was suggested to him in course of<br>conversation. That person devoted to tranquillity hears this sacred<br>history directly connected with the topic of Emancipation is certain to<br>attain to the highest end."[1789]
