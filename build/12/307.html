                            '"Janaka said, Thou hast, O foremost of Rishis, said that Unity is the<br>attribute of that which is Akshara (Indestructible) and variety or<br>multiplicity is the attribute of what is known as Kshara (Destructible).<br>I have not, however, clearly understood the nature of these two. Doubts<br>are still lurking in my mind. Ignorant men look upon the Soul as endued<br>with the incident of multiplicity. They, however that are possessed of<br>knowledge and wisdom regard the Soul to be one and the same. I how-ever,<br>have a very dull understanding. I am, therefore, unable to comprehend how<br>all this can happen. The causes also that thou hast assigned for the<br>unity and the multiplicity of Akshara and Kshara I have almost forgotten<br>in consequence of the restlessness of my understanding. I therefore,<br>desire to hear thee once more discourse to me on those same incidents of<br>unity and multiplicity, on him who is knowing, on what is destitute of<br>knowledge, on Jiva-soul, Knowledge, Ignorance. Akshara, Kshara, and on<br>the Sankhya and the Yoga systems, in detail and separately and agreeable<br>to the truth.<br><br>"'Vasishtha said, I shall tell thee what thou askest! Listen however, to<br>me, O monarch, as I expound to thee the practices of Yoga separately.<br>Contemplation, which constitutes an obligatory practices with Yogins, is<br>their highest puissance[1619]. Those conversant with Yoga say that<br>Contemplation is of two kinds. One is the concentration of the mind, and<br>the other is called Pranayama (regulation of breath). Pranayama is said<br>to be endued with substance; while concentration of mind is unendued with<br>it.[1620] Excepting the three times when a man passes urine and stools<br>and eats, one should devote the whole of his time to contemplation.<br>With-drawing the senses from their objects by the aid of the mind, one<br>possessed of intelligence, having made oneself pure, should agreeably to<br>the two and twenty modes of transmitting the Prana breath, unite the<br>Jiva-soul with That which transcends the four and twentieth topic (called<br>Ignorance or Prakriti)[1621] which is regarded by the wise as dwelling in<br>every part of the body and as transcending decay and destruction. It is<br>by means of those two and twenty methods that the Soul may always be<br>known, as heard by us. It is certain that this practice of Yoga is his<br>whose mind is never affected by evil passions. It is not any other<br>person's. Dissociated from all attachments, abstemious in diet, and<br>subduing all the senses, one should fix one's mind on the Soul, during<br>the first and the last part of the night, after having, O king of<br>Mithila, suspended the functions of the senses, quieted the mind by the<br>understanding, and assumed a posture as motionless as that of a block of<br>stone. When men of knowledge, conversant with the rules of Yoga, become<br>as fixed as a stake of wood, and as immovable as a mountain, then are<br>they said to be in Yoga. When one does not hear, and smell, and taste,<br>and see; when one is not conscious of any touch; when one's mind becomes<br>perfectly free from every purpose; when one is not conscious of any<br>thing, when one cherishes no thought; when one becomes like a piece of<br>wood, then is one called by the wise to be in perfect Yoga. At such a<br>time one shines like a lamp that burns in a place where there is no wind;<br>at such a time one becomes freed even from one's subtile form, and<br>perfectly united with Brahma. When one attains to such progress, one has<br>no longer to ascend or to fall among intermediate beings. When persons<br>like ourselves say that there has been a complete identification of the<br>Knower, the Known, and K now-ledge, then is the Yogin said to behold the<br>Supreme Soul.[1622] While in Yoga, the Supreme Soul displays itself in<br>the Yogin's heart like a blazing fire, or like the bright Sun, or like<br>the lightning's flame in the sky. That Supreme Soul which is Unborn and<br>which is the essence of nectar, that is seen by high-souled Brahmanas<br>endued with intelligence and wisdom and conversant with the Vedas, is<br>subtiler than what is subtile and greater than what is great. That Soul,<br>though dwelling in all creatures, is not seen by them. The creator of the<br>worlds, He is seen only by a person endued with wealth of intelligence<br>when aided by the lamp of the mind. He dwells on the other share of thick<br>Darkness and transcends him called Iswara.[1623] Persons conversant with<br>the Vedas and endued with omniscience call Him the dispeller of Darkness,<br>stainless, transcending Darkness, without attributes and endued therewith.<br><br>"'This is what is called the Yoga of Yogins. What else is the indication<br>of Yoga? By such practices do Yogins succeeded in beholding the Supreme<br>Soul that transcends destruction and decay. This much that I have told<br>thee in detail concerns about the science of Yoga. I shall now discourse<br>to thee of that Sankhya philosophy by which the Supreme Soul is seen<br>through the gradual destruction of errors.[1624] The Sankhyas, whose<br>system is built on Prakriti, say that Prakriti, which is Unmanifest, is<br>the foremost. From Prakriti, they say, O monarch, the second principle<br>called Mahat, is produced. It is heard by us that from Mahat flows the<br>third principle called Consciousness. The Sankhyas blessed with sight of<br>the Soul say that from Consciousness flow the five subtile essence of<br>sound, form, touch, taste, and scent. All these eight they call by the<br>name of Prakriti. The modifications of these eight are sixteen in number.<br>They are the five gross essence of space, light, earth, water, and wind,<br>and the ten senses of action and of knowledge including the mind. Men of<br>wisdom devoted to the Sankhya path and conversant with all its ordinances<br>and dispensations regard these four and twenty topics as embracing the<br>whole range of Sankhya enquiry. That which is produced becomes merged in<br>the producing. Created by the Supreme Soul one after another, these<br>principles are destroyed in a reverse order. At every new Creation, the<br>Gunas start into existence in the lateral order (as stated above), and<br>(when Destruction comes) they merge, (each into its progenitor) in a<br>reverse order, like the waves of the ocean disappearing in the ocean that<br>gives them birth. O best of kings, this is the manner in which the<br>Creation and the Destruction of Prakriti takes place. The Supreme Being<br>is all that remains when Universal Destruction takes place, and it is He<br>that assumes multifarious forms when Creation starts into life. This is<br>even so, O king, as ascertained by men of knowledge. It is Prakriti that<br>causes the Overpresiding Purusha to thus assume diversity and revert back<br>to unity. Prakriti also herself has the same indications. Only fully<br>conversant with the nature of the topics of enquiry knows that Prakriti<br>also assumes the same kind of diversity and unity, for when Destruction<br>comes she reverts into unity and when Creation flows she assumes<br>diversity of form. The Soul makes Prakriti, which contains the principles<br>of production or growth, to assume manifold forms. Prakriti is called<br>Kshetra (or soil). Transcending the four and twenty topics or principles<br>is the Soul which is great. It presides over that Prakriti or Kshetra.<br>Hence, O great king, the foremost of Yatis say that the Soul is the<br>Presider. Indeed, it has been heard by us that in consequence of the<br>Soul's presiding over all Kshetras He is called the Presider. And because<br>He knows that Unmanifest Kshetra, He is, therefore, also called<br>Kshetrajna (Knower of Kshetra). And because also the Soul enters into<br>Unmanifest Kshetra (viz., the body), therefore he is called Purusha.<br>Kshetra is something quite different from Kshetrajna. Kshetra is<br>Unmanifest. The Soul, which transcends the four and twenty principles, is<br>called the Knower. Knowledge and the object known are different from each<br>other. Knowledge, again, has been said to be Unmanifest, while the object<br>of knowledge is the Soul which transcends the four and twenty principles.<br>The Unmanifest is called Kshetra. Sattwa (understanding), and also Iswara<br>(the supreme Lord), while Purusha, which is the twenty-fifth principle<br>has nothing superior to it and is not a principle (for it transcends all<br>principles and is only called a principle conventionally). This much O<br>king, is an account of the Sankhya philosophy. The Sankhyas called the<br>cause of the universe, and merging all the grosser principles into the<br>Chit behold the Supreme Soul. Rightly studying the four and twenty topics<br>along with Prakriti, and ascertaining their true nature, the Sankhyas<br>succeed in beholding That which transcends the four and twenty topics or<br>principles.[1625] Jiva in reality is that very Soul which transcends<br>Prakriti and is beyond the four and twenty topics. When he succeeds in<br>knowing that Supreme Soul by dissociating himself from Prakriti, he then<br>becomes identifiable with the Supreme Soul. I have now told thee every<br>thing about the Sankhya System truly. Those who are conversant with this<br>philosophy succeed in attaining are subject to error have direct<br>cognisance of Brahma. They that succeed in attaining to tranquillity.<br>Indeed, as men whose understanding are subject to error have direct<br>cognisance of Brahma. They that succeed in attaining to that state have<br>never to come back to this world after the dissolution of their bodies;<br>while as regards those that are said to be emancipate in this life,<br>puissance, and that indescribable felicity which attaches itself to<br>Samadhi, and immutability, become theirs, in consequence of their having<br>attained to the nature of the Indestructible.[1626] They who behold this<br>universe as many (instead of seeing it as one and uniform) are said to<br>see incorrectly. These men are blind to Brahma. O chastiser of foes, such<br>persons have repeatedly to come back into the world and assume bodies (in<br>diverse orders of Being). They who are conversant with all that has been<br>said above become possessed of omniscience, and accordingly when they<br>pass from this body no longer become subject to the control of any more<br>physical frames. All things, (or the entire universe), have been said to<br>be the result of the Unmanifest. The Soul, which is the twenty-fifth,<br>transcends all things. They who know the Soul have no fear of returning<br>to the world.'"
