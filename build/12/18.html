                            Vaisampayana said, "When Yudhishthira, after saying these words, became<br>silent, Arjuna, afflicted by that speech of the king, and burning with<br>sorrow and grief, once more addressed his eldest brother, saying, 'People<br>recite this old history, O Bharata, about the discourse between the ruler<br>of the Videhas and his queen. That history has reference to the words<br>which the grief-stricken spouse of the ruler of the Videhas had said to<br>her lord when the latter, abandoning his kingdom, had resolved to lead a<br>life of mendicancy. Casting off wealth and children and wives and<br>precious possessions of various kinds and the established path for<br>acquiring religious merit and fire itself.[53] King Janaka shaved his<br>head (and assumed the garb of a mendicant). His dear spouse beheld him<br>deprived of wealth, installed in the observance of the vow of mendicancy,<br>resolved to abstain from inflicting any kind of injury on others, free<br>from vanity of every kind, and prepared to subsist upon a handful of<br>barley fallen off from the stalk and to be got by picking the grains from<br>crevices in the field. Approaching her lord at a time when no one was<br>with him, the queen, endued with great strength of mind, fearlessly and<br>in wrath, told him these words fraught with reason: 'Why hast thou<br>adopted a life of mendicancy, abandoning thy kingdom full of wealth and<br>corn? A handful of fallen off barley cannot be proper for thee. Thy<br>resolution tallies not with thy acts,[54] since abandoning thy large<br>kingdom thou covetest, O king, a handful of grain! With this handful of<br>barley, O king, wilt thou succeed in gratifying thy guests, gods. Rishis<br>and Pitris? This thy labour, therefore, is bootless. Alas, abandoned by<br>all these, viz., gods, guest and Pitris, thou leadest a life, of<br>wandering mendicancy, O king, having cast off all action. Thou wert,<br>before this, the supporter of thousands of Brahmanas versed in the three<br>Vedas and of many more besides. How canst thou desire to beg of them thy<br>own food today? Abandoning thy blazing prosperity, thou castest thy eyes<br>around like a dog (for his food). Thy mother hath today been made sonless<br>by thee, and thy spouse, the princess of Kosala, a widow. These helpless<br>Kshatriyas, expectant of fruit and religious merit, wait upon thee,<br>placing all their hopes on thee. By killing those hopes of theirs, to<br>what regions shalt thou go, O king, especially when salvation is doubtful<br>and creatures are dependent on actions?[55] Sinful as thou art, thou hast<br>neither this world nor the other, since thou wishest to live, having cast<br>off thy wedded wife?[56] Why, indeed, dost thou lead a life of wandering<br>mendicancy, abstaining from all actions, after having abandoned garlands<br>and perfumes and ornaments and robes of diverse kinds? Having been, as it<br>were, a large and sacred take unto all creatures, having been a mighty<br>tree worthy of adoration and granting its shelter unto all, alas, how<br>canst thou wait upon and worship others? If even an elephant desists from<br>all work, carnivorous creatures coming in packs and innumerable worms<br>would eat it up. What need be said of thyself that art so powerless?[57]<br>How couldst thy heart be set on that mode of life which recommends an<br>earthen pot, and a triple-headed stick, and which forces one to abandon<br>his very clothes and which permits the acceptance of only a handful of<br>barley after abandonment of everything? If, again, thou sayest that<br>kingdom and a handful of barley are the same to thee, then why dost thou<br>abandon the former! If, again, a handful of barley becomes an object of<br>attachment with thee, then, thy original resolution (of abandoning<br>everything) falls to the ground, If, again, thou canst act up to thy<br>resolution of abandoning everything! then who am I to thee, who art thou<br>to me, and what can be thy grace to me?[58] If thou beest inclined to<br>grace, rule then this Earth! They that are desirous of happiness but are<br>very poor and indigent and abandoned by friends may adopt renunciation.<br>But he who imitates those men by abandoning palatial mansions and beds<br>and vehicles and robes and ornaments, acts improperly, indeed. One always<br>accepts gifts made by others; another always makes gifts. Thou knowest<br>the difference between the two. Who, indeed, of these two shouldst be<br>regarded the superior? If a gift be made to one who always accepts gifts,<br>or to one that is possessed of pride, that gift becomes bootless like the<br>clarified butter that is poured upon a forest-conflagration.[59] As a<br>fire, O king, never dies till it has consumed all that has been thrown<br>into it, even so a beggar can never be silenced tilt he receives a<br>donative. In this world, the food that is given by a charitable person is<br>the sure support of the pious. If, therefore, the king does not give<br>(food) where will the pious that are desirous of salvation go?[60] They<br>that have food (in their houses) are house-holders. Mendicants are<br>supported by them. Life flows from food. Therefore, the giver of food is<br>the giver of life. Coming out from among those that lead a domestic mode<br>of life, mendicants depend upon those very persons from whom they come.<br>Those self-restrained men, by doing this, acquire and enjoy fame and<br>power. One is not to be called a mendicant for his having only renounced<br>his possessions, or for his having only adopted a life of dependence on<br>eleemosynary charity. He who renounces the possessions and pleasures of<br>the world in a sincere frame of mind is to be regarded a true<br>mendicant.[61] Unattached at heart, though attached in outward show,<br>standing aloof from the world, having broken all his bonds, and regarding<br>friend and foe equally, such a man, O king, is regarded to be<br>emancipated! Having shaved their heads clean and adopted the brown robe,<br>men may be seen to betake themselves to a life of wandering mendicancy,<br>though bound by various ties and though ever on the lookout for bootless<br>wealth. They who, casting off the three Vedas, their usual occupations,<br>and children, adopt a life or mendicancy by taking up the triple-headed<br>crutch and the brown robe, are really persons of little understanding.<br>Without having cast off anger and other faults, the adoption of only the<br>brown robe, know, O king, is due to the desire of earning the means of<br>sustenance. Those persons of clean-shaven heads that have set up the<br>banner of virtue, have this only (viz., the acquisition of sustenance)<br>for their object in life. Therefore, O king, keeping thy passions under<br>control, do thou win regions of bliss hereafter by supporting them that<br>are truly pious amongst men of matted locks or clean-shaven heads, naked<br>or clad in rags, or skins or brown robes. Who is there that is more<br>virtuous than he who maintains his sacred fire, who performs sacrifices<br>with presents of animals and Dakshina, and who practises charity day and<br>night?'<br><br>"Arjuna continued, 'King Janaka is regarded to have been a truth-knowing<br>person in this world. Even he, in this matter (viz., the ascertainment of<br>duty) had become stupefied. Do not yield to stupefaction! Even thus the<br>duties of Domesticity are observed by persons practising charity. By<br>abstaining from injuries of all kinds, by casting off desire and wrath,<br>by being engaged in protecting all creatures, by observing the excellent<br>duty of charity, and lastly by cherishing superiors and persons of age,<br>we shall succeed in attaining such regions of bliss as we like. By duly<br>gratifying gods, guests, and all creatures, by worshipping Brahmanas, and<br>by truthfulness of speech, we shall certainly attain to desirable regions<br>of bliss.'"
