                            "Vyasa said, 'The knowledge called Trayi which occurs in the Vedas and<br>their branches should be acquired. That knowledge is to be derived from<br>the Richs, the Samans, and the sciences called Varna and Akshara. There<br>are besides, the Yajuses and the Atharvans. In the six kinds of acts<br>indicated in these, dwells the Divine Being. They that are well-versed in<br>the declarations of the Vedas, that have knowledge of the Soul, that are<br>attached to the quality of Goodness, and that are highly blessed, succeed<br>in understanding the origin and the end of all things. A Brahmana should<br>live in the observance of the duties laid down in the Vedas. He should do<br>all his acts like a good man of restrained soul. He should earn his<br>livelihood without injuring any creature. Having derived knowledge from<br>the good and wise, he should control his passions and propensities.<br>Well-versed in the scriptures, he should practise those duties that have<br>been laid down for him, and do all acts in this world guided by the<br>quality of goodness. Leading even the domestic mode of life., the<br>Brahmana should be observant of the six acts already spoken of.[901] His<br>heart full of faith, he should worship the deities in the five well-known<br>sacrifices. Endued with patience, never heedless, having self-control,<br>conversant with duties, with a cleansed soul, divested of joy, pride, and<br>wrath, the Brahmana should never sink in languor. Gifts, study of the<br>Vedas, sacrifices, penances, modesty, guilelessness, and<br>self-restraint,&#8212;these enhance one's energy and destroy one's sins. One<br>endued with intelligence should be abstemious in diet and should conquer<br>one's senses. Indeed, having subdued both lust and wrath, and having<br>washed away all his sins, he should strive for attaining to Brahma. He<br>should worship the Fire and Brahmanas, and bow to the deities. He should<br>avoid all kinds of inauspicious discourse and all acts of unrighteous<br>injury. This preliminary course of conduct is first laid down for a<br>Brahmana. Subsequently, when knowledge comes, he should engage himself in<br>acts, for in acts lies success.[902] The Brahmana who is endued with<br>intelligence succeeds in crossing the stream of life that is so difficult<br>to cross and that is so furious and terrible, that has the five senses<br>for its waters that has cupidity for its source, and wrath for its mire.<br>He should never shut his eyes to the fact that Time stands behind him in<br>a threatening attitude.&#8212;Time who is the great stupefier of all things,<br>and who is armed with very great and irresistible force, issuing from the<br>great Ordainer himself. Generated by the current of Nature, the universe<br>is being ceaselessly carried along. The mighty river of Time, overspread<br>with eddies constituted by the years, having the months for its waves and<br>the seasons for its current, the fortnights for its floating straw and<br>grass, and the rise and fall of the eyelids for its froth, the days and<br>the nights for its water, and desire and lust for its terrible<br>crocodiles, the Vedas and sacrifices for its rafts, and the righteousness<br>of creatures for its islands, and Profit and Pleasure for its springs,<br>truthfulness of speech and Emancipation for its shores, benevolence for<br>the trees that float along it, and the yugas for the lakes along its<br>course,&#8212;the mighty river of Time,&#8212;which has an origin as inconceivable<br>as that of Brahma itself, is ceaselessly bearing away all beings created<br>by the great Ordainer towards the abode of Yama.[903] Persons possessed<br>of wisdom and patience always succeed in crossing this awful river by<br>employing the rafts of knowledge and wisdom. What, however, can senseless<br>fools, destitute of similar rafts do (when thrown into that furious<br>stream)? That only the man of wisdom succeeds in crossing this stream and<br>not he that is unwise, is consistent with reason. The former beholds from<br>a distance the merits and faults of everything. (Accordingly, he succeeds<br>in adopting or rejecting what is deserving of adoption or rejection). The<br>man, however, of unstable and little understanding, and whose soul is<br>full of desire and cupidity, is always filled with doubt. Hence the man<br>destitute of wisdom never succeeds in crossing that river. He also who<br>sits inactively (in doubt) can never pass it over. The man destitute of<br>the raft of wisdom, in consequence of his having to bear the heavy weight<br>of great faults, sinks down. One that is seized by the crocodile of<br>desire, even if possessed of knowledge, can never make knowledge one's<br>raft.[904] For these reasons, the man of wisdom and intelligence should<br>strive to float over the stream of Time (without sinking in it). He<br>indeed, succeeds in keeping himself afloat who becomes conversant with<br>Brahma. One born in a noble race, abstaining from the three duties of<br>teaching, officiating at other's sacrifices and accepting gifts, and<br>doing only the three other acts, viz., studying, sacrificing, and giving,<br>should, for those reasons, strive to float over the stream. Such a man is<br>sure to cross it aided by the raft of wisdom. One who is pure in conduct,<br>who is self-restrained and observant of good vows, whose soul is under<br>control, and who is possessed of wisdom, certainly wins success in this<br>and the other world. The Brahmana leading a domestic mode of life should<br>conquer wrath and envy, practise the virtues already named, and<br>worshipping the deities in the five sacrifices, eat after having fed the<br>deities, Pitris, and guests. He should conform to those duties which are<br>observed by the good; he should do all his acts like a person of governed<br>soul; and he should, without injuring any creature, draw his substance by<br>adopting a course that is not censurable. One who is well-versed in the<br>truths of the Vedas and the other branches of knowledge, whose behaviour<br>is like that of a person of well-governed soul, who is endued with a<br>clear vision, who observes those duties that are laid down for his order,<br>who does not, by his acts, produce an inter-mixture of duties, who<br>attends to the observances set down in the scriptures, who is full of<br>faith, who is self-restrained, who is possessed of wisdom, who is<br>destitute of envy and malice, and who is well-conversant with the<br>distinctions between righteousness and inequity, succeeds in crossing all<br>his difficulties. That Brahmana who is possessed of fortitude, who is<br>always heedful, who is self-restrained, who is conversant with<br>righteousness, whose soul is under control, and who has transcended joy,<br>pride, and wrath, has never to languish in grief. This is the course of<br>conduct that was ordained of old for a Brahmana. He should strive for the<br>acquisition of Knowledge, and do all the scriptural acts. By living thus,<br>he is sure to obtain success. One who is not possessed of clear vision<br>does wrong even when one wishes to do right. Such a person, by even<br>exercising his judgment, does such acts of virtue as partake of the<br>nature of inequity. Desiring to do what is right, one does what is wrong.<br>Similarly, desiring to do what is wrong one does what is right. Such a<br>person is a fool. Not knowing, the two kinds of acts, one has to undergo<br>repeated rebirths and deaths.'"
