                            "Yudhishthira said, 'When practices fraught with high morality and<br>beneficial to the world, (viz., those that appertain to righteous rule)<br>disappear, when all the means and resources for the support of life fall<br>into the hands of robbers, when, indeed, such a calamitous time sets in,<br>by what means should a Brahmana, O grandsire, who from affection is<br>unable to desert his sons and grandsons, subsist?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'When such a time sets in, the Brahmana should live by the<br>aid of knowledge. Everything in this world is for them that are good.<br>Nothing here is for them that are wicked. He who making himself an<br>instrument of acquisition, takes wealth from the wicked and gives it unto<br>them that are good, is said to be conversant with the morality of<br>adversity. Desirous of maintaining his rule, the king, O monarch, without<br>driving his subjects to indignation and rebellion, may take what is not<br>freely given by the owner, saying, 'This is mine!' That wise man who,<br>cleansed by the possession of knowledge and might and of righteous<br>conduct at other times, acts censurably in such season, does not really<br>deserve to be censured. They who always support themselves by putting<br>forth their might never like any other method of living. They that are<br>endued with might, O Yudhishthira, always live by the aid of prowess. The<br>ordinary scriptures, that exist (for seasons of distress) without<br>exceptions of any kind, should be practised by a king (at such times). A<br>king, however, that is endued with intelligence, while following those<br>scriptures, would do something more.[398] At such times, however, the<br>king should not oppress, Ritwijas, and Purohitas and preceptors and<br>Brahmanas, all of whom are honoured and held in high esteem. By<br>oppressing them, even at such times, he incurs reproach and sin. This<br>that I tell thee is regarded as an authority in the world. Indeed, this<br>is the eternal eye (by which practices in seasons of distress are to be<br>viewed). One should be guided by his authority. By this is to be judged<br>whether a king is to be called good or wicked. It is seen that many<br>persons residing in villages and towns, actuated by jealousy and wrath,<br>accuse one another. The king should never, at their words, honour or<br>punish anybody. Slander should never be spoken. If spoken, it should<br>never be heard. When slanderous converse goes on, one should close one's<br>ears or leave the place outright. Slanderous converse is the<br>characteristic of wicked men. It is an indication of depravity. They, on<br>the other hand, O king, who speak of the virtues of others in assemblies<br>of the good, are good men. As a pair of sweet-tempered bulls governable<br>and well-broken and used to bear burthens, put their necks to the yoke<br>and drag the cart willingly, even so should the king bear his burthens<br>(in seasons of distress). Others say that a king (at such times) should<br>conduct himself in such a way that he may succeed in gaining a large<br>number of allies. Some regard ancient usage as the highest indication of<br>righteousness. Others, viz., they that are in favour of the conduct<br>pursued by Sankha, towards Likhita, do not hold this opinion. They do not<br>advance such an opinion through either malice or covetousness[399].<br>Examples are seen of even great Rishis who have laid down that even<br>preceptors, if addicted to evil practices, should be punished. But<br>approvable authority there is none for such a proposition. The gods may<br>be left to punish such men when they happen to be vile and guilty of<br>wicked practices. The king who fills his treasury by having recourse to<br>fraudulent devices, certainly falls away from righteousness. The code of<br>morality which is honoured in every respect by those that are good and in<br>affluent circumstances, and which is approved by every honest heart,<br>should be followed. He is said to be conversant with duty who knows duty<br>as depending on all the four foundations. It is difficult to find out the<br>reasons on which duties stand even as it is difficult to find out the<br>legs of the snake.[400] As a hunter of beasts discovers the track of a<br>shaft-struck deer by observing spots of blood on the ground, even so<br>should one seek to discover the reasons of duties. This should a man<br>tread with humility along the path trod by the good. Such, indeed, was<br>the conduct of the great royal sages of old, O Yudhishthira!'"
