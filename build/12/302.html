                            YUDHISHTHIRA SAID, 'O king thou hast duly propounded unto me, in the way<br>in which it should be, the path of Yoga which is approved by the wise,<br>after the manner of a loving preceptor unto his pupil. I ask now about<br>the principles of the Sankhya philosophy. Do thou discourse to me on<br>those principles in their entirety. Whatever knowledge exists in the<br>three worlds is known to thee!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen now to what the subtile principles are of the<br>followers of the Sankhya doctrine have been established by all the great<br>and puissant Yatis having Kapila their first. In that doctrine O chief of<br>men, no errors are discoverable. Many, indeed, are its merits. In fact,<br>there is no fault in it. Comprehending with the aid of knowledge that all<br>objects exist with faults, indeed, understanding that the objects&#8212;so<br>difficult to cast off&#8212;with which human beings and Pisachas and Rakshasas<br>and Yakshas and snakes and Gandharvas and pitris and those that are<br>wandering in the intermediate orders of beings (such as birds and<br>animals) and great birds (such as Garuda and others) and the Maruts and<br>royal sages and regenerate sages and Asuras and Viswedevas and the<br>celestial Rishis and Yogins invested with supreme puissance and the<br>Prajapatis and Brahman himself are engaged, and understanding truly what<br>the highest limit is of one's period of existence in this world, and<br>apprehending also the great truth. O foremost of eloquent men, about what<br>is called felicity here, having a clear knowledge of what the sorrows are<br>that overtake when the hour comes all those that are concerned with<br>(transitory) objects and knowing full well the sorrows of those that have<br>fallen into the intermediate orders of being and of those that have sunk<br>into hell, perceiving all the merits and all the faults of heaven, O<br>Bharta, and all the demerits that attach to the declarations of the Vedas<br>and all the excellencies that are connected with them recognising the<br>faults and merits of the Yoga and the Sankhya systems of philosophy,<br>realizing also that the quality of Sattwa has ten properties, that of<br>Rajas has nine, and that of Tamas has eight, that the Understanding has<br>seven properties, the Mind has six, and Space has five, and once more<br>conceiving that the Understanding has four properties and Tamas has<br>three, and the Rajas has two and Sattwa has, one, and truly apprehending<br>the path that is followed by all objects when destruction overtakes them<br>and what the course is of self knowledge, the Sankhyas, possessed of<br>knowledge and experience and exalted by their perceptions of causes, and<br>acquiring thorough auspiciousness, attain to the felicity of Emancipation<br>like the rays of the Sun, or the Wind taking refuge in Space.[1585]<br>Vision is attached to form; the sense of scent to smell, the ear to<br>sound, the tongue to juices, and the skin (or body) to touch. The wind<br>has for its refuge Space. Stupefaction has Tamas (Darkness) for its<br>refuge. Cupidity has the objects of the senses for its refuge. Vishnu is<br>attached to (the organs of) motion. Sakra is attached to (the organs of)<br>strength. The deity of fire is attached to the stomach, Earth is attached<br>to the Waters. The Waters have Heat (or fire) for their refuge. Heat<br>attaches itself to the Wind; and the wind has Space for its refuge; and<br>Space has Mahat for its refuge, and Mahat has the Understanding for its<br>foundation. The Understanding has its refuge in Tamas; Tamas has Rajas<br>for its refuge; Rajas is founded upon Sattwa; and Sattwa is attached to<br>the Soul. The soul has the glorious and puissant Narayana for its refuge.<br>That glorious deity has Emancipation for his refuge. Emancipation is<br>independent of all refuge. Knowing that this body, that is endued with<br>six and ten possessions, is the result of the quality of Sattwa,<br>understanding fully the nature of the physical organism and the character<br>of the Chetana that dwells within it, recognising the one existent Being<br>that live in the body viz., the Soul, which stands aloof from every<br>concern of the body and in which no sin can attach, realising the nature<br>of that second object, viz.; the acts of persons attached to the objects<br>of the senses, understanding also the character of the senses and the<br>sensual objects which have their refuge in the Soul, appreciating the<br>difficulty of Emancipation and the scriptures that bear upon it knowing<br>fully the nature of the vital breaths called Prana, Apana, Samana, Vyana,<br>and Udana, as also the two other breaths, viz., the one going downward<br>and the other moving upward indeed, knowing those seven breaths ordained<br>to accomplish seven different functions, ascertaining the nature of the<br>Prajapatis and the Rishis and the high paths, many in number, of virtue<br>or righteousness, and the seven Rishis and the innumerable royal Rishis,<br>O scorcher of foes, and the great celestial Rishis and the other<br>regenerate Rishis endued with the effulgence of the Sun, beholding all<br>these falling away from their puissance in course of many long ages, O<br>monarch, hearing of the destruction of even of all the mighty beings in<br>the universe, understanding also the inauspicious end that is attained, O<br>king, by creatures of sinful acts, and the miseries endured by those that<br>fall into the river Vaitarani in the realms of Yama, and the inauspicious<br>wanderings of creatures through diverse wombs, and the character of their<br>residence in the unholy uterus in the midst of blood and water and phlegm<br>and urine and faeces, all of foul smell, and then in bodies that result<br>from the union of blood and the vital seed, of marrow and sinews,<br>abounding with hundreds of nerves and arteries and forming an impure<br>mansion of nine doors, comprehending also what is for his own good what<br>those divers combinations are which are productive of good beholding the<br>abominable conduct of creatures whose natures are characterised by<br>Darkness or Passion or Goodness, O chief of Bharata's race&#8212;conduct that<br>is reprehended, in view of its incapacity to acquire Emancipation, by the<br>followers of the Sankhya doctrine who are fully conversant with the Soul,<br>beholding the swallowing up of the Moon and the Sun by Rahu, the falling<br>of stars from their fixed positions and the diversions of constellations<br>from their orbits, knowing the sad separation of all united objects and<br>the diabolical behaviour of creatures in devouring one another, seeing<br>the absence of all intelligence in the infancy of human beings and the<br>deterioration and destruction of the body, marking the little attachment<br>creatures have to the quality of Sattwa in consequence of their being<br>overwhelmed by wrath and stupefaction, beholding also only one among<br>thousands of human beings resolved to struggle after the acquisition of<br>Emancipation, understanding the difficulty of attaining to Emancipation<br>according to what is stated in the scriptures, seeing the marked<br>solicitude that creatures manifest for all unattained objects and their<br>comparative indifference to all objects that have been attained marking<br>the wickedness that results from all objects of the senses O king and the<br>repulsive bodies, O son of Kunti, of persons reft of life, and the<br>residence, always fraught with grief, of human beings, O Bharata, in<br>houses (in the midst of spouses and children), knowing the end of those<br>terrible and fallen men who become guilty of slaying Brahmanas, and of<br>those wicked Brahmanas that are addicted to the drinking of alcoholic<br>stimulants, and the equally sad end of those that become criminally<br>attached to the spouses of their preceptors, and of those men, O<br>Yudhishthira, that do not properly reverence their mothers, as also of<br>those that have no reverence and worship to offer to the deities,<br>understanding also, with the help of that knowledge (which their<br>philosophy imparts), the end that of all perpetrators of wicked acts, and<br>the diverse ends that overtake those who have taken birth among the<br>intermediate orders, ascertaining the diverse declarations of the Vedas,<br>the courses of seasons, the fading of years, of months, of fortnights,<br>and of days, beholding directly the waxing and the waning of the Moon,<br>seeing the rising and the ebbing of the seas, and the diminution of<br>wealth and its increase once more, and the separation of united objects,<br>the lapse of Yugas, the destruction of mountains, the drying up of<br>rivers, the deterioration of (the purity of) the several orders and the<br>end also of that deterioration occurring repeatedly, beholding the birth,<br>decrepitude, death, and sorrows of creatures, knowing truly the faults<br>attaching to the body and the sorrows to which human beings are subject,<br>and the vicissitudes to which the bodies of creatures are subject, and<br>understanding all the faults that attach to their own souls, and also all<br>the inauspicious faults that attach to their own bodies (the followers of<br>the Sankhya philosophy succeed in attaining to Emancipation).<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O thou of immeasurable energy, what are those faults<br>that thou seest attaching to one's body? It behoveth thee to ex-pound<br>this doubt to me fully and truly'?<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O slayer of foes! The Sankhyas or followers of<br>Kapila, who are conversant with all paths and endued with wisdom, say<br>that there are five faults, O puissant one, in the human body. They are<br>Desire and Wrath and Fear and Sleep and Breath. These faults are seen in<br>the bodies of all embodied creatures. Those that are endued with wisdom<br>cut the root of wrath with the aid of Forgiveness. Desire is cut off by<br>casting off all purposes. By cultivation of the quality of Goodness<br>(Sattwa) sleep is conquered, and Fear is conquered by cultivating<br>Heedfulness. Breath is conquered by abstemiousness of diet O king. Truly<br>understanding gunas by the aid of hundreds of gunas, hundreds of faults,<br>and diverse causes by hundreds of causes, ascertaining that the world is<br>like the froth of water, enveloped by hundreds of illusions flowing from<br>Vishnu, like a painted edifice, and as unsubstantial as a reed, beholding<br>it to be (as terrible as) a dark pit, or as unreal as bubbles of water,<br>for the years that compose its age are as shortlived (compared to the<br>duration of eternity) as bubbles, seeing it exposed to immediate<br>destruction, bereft of happiness, having certain ruin for its end and<br>from which it can never escape, sunk in Rajas and Tamas, and utterly<br>helpless like an elephant sunk in mire,&#8212;noting all this&#8212;the Sankhyas, O<br>king, endued with great wisdom, casting off all affections arising from<br>one's relation towards one's children, by the aid, O king, of that<br>extensive and all-embracing knowledge which their system advocates and<br>cutting off quickly, with the weapon of knowledge and the bludgeon of<br>penances, O Bharata, all inauspicious scents born of Rajas and all scents<br>of a like nature arising from Tamas and all auspicious scents arising<br>from Sattwa and all pleasures of the touch (and of the other senses) born<br>of the same three qualities and inhering to the body, indeed, O Bharata,<br>aided by the Yoga of knowledge, these Yatis crowned with success,&#8212;cross<br>the Ocean of life. That Ocean, so terrible has sorrow for its waters.<br>Anxiety and grief constitute its deep lakes. Disease and death are its<br>gigantic alligators. The great fears that strike the heart at every step<br>are its huge snakes. The deeds inspired by Tamas are its tortoises. Those<br>inspired by Rajas are its fishes. Wisdom constitutes the raft for<br>crossing it. The affections entertained for objects of the senses are its<br>mire. Decrepitude constitutes its region of grief and trouble.[1586]<br>Knowledge, O chastiser of foes, is its island. Acts constitute its great<br>depth. Truth is its shores. Pious observances constitute the verdant<br>weeds floating on its bosom.[1587] Envy constitutes its rapid and mighty<br>current. The diverse sentiments of the heart constitute its mines. The<br>diverse kinds of gratification are its valuable gems. Grief and fever are<br>its winds. Misery and thirst are its mighty eddies. Painful and fatal<br>diseases are its huge elephants. The assemblage of bones are its flights<br>of steps, and phlegm is its froth. Gifts are its pearl-banks. The lakes<br>of blood are its corals. Loud laughter constitutes its roars. Diverse<br>sciences are its impassability. Tears are its brine. Renunciation of<br>company constitutes the high refuge (of those that seek to cross it).<br>Children and spouses are its unnumbered leeches. Friends and kinsmen are<br>the cities and towns on its shores. Abstention from injury, and Truth,<br>are its boundary line. Death is its storm-wave. The knowledge of Vedanta<br>is its island (capable of affording refuge to those that are tossed upon<br>its waters). Acts of compassion towards all creatures constitute its<br>life-buoys,[1588] and Emancipation is the priceless commodity offered to<br>those voyaging on its waters in search of merchandise. Like its<br>substantive prototype with its equine head disgorging flames of fire,<br>this ocean too has its fiery terrors. Having transcended the liability,<br>that is so difficult to transcend, of dwelling within the gross body, the<br>Sankhyas enter into pure space.[1589] Surya then bears, with his rays,<br>those righteous men that are practicers of the Sankhya doctrines. Like<br>the fibres of the lotus-stalk conveying water to the flower into which<br>they all converge. Surya, drinking all things from the universe, conveys<br>them unto those good and wise men.[1590] There attachments all destroyed,<br>possessed of energy, endued with wealth of penances, and crowned with<br>success, these Yatis, O Bharata, are born by that wind which is subtile,<br>cooling, fragrant, and delicious to the touch, O Bharata! In fact, that<br>wind which is the best of the seven winds, and which blows in regions of<br>great felicity, conveys them, O son of Kunti, to that which is the<br>highest end in space.[1591] Then space into which they are carried, O<br>monarch, conveys them to the highest end of Rajas.[1592] Rajas then bear<br>them to the highest end of Sattwa. Sattwa then bears them, O thou of pure<br>soul, to the Supreme and puissant Narayana. The puissant and pure-souled<br>Narayana at last, through himself, bears them to the Supreme Soul. Having<br>reached the Supreme Soul, those stainless persons who have (by that time)<br>become the body of (what is called). That attain to immortality, and they<br>have never afterwards to return from that position. O King! That is the<br>highest end, O son of Pritha, which is attained by those high-souled men<br>who have transcended the influence of all pairs of opposites.'"<br><br>Yudhishthira said, 'O sinless one, have those persons of firm vows after<br>they have attained to that excellent position which is fraught with<br>puissance and felicity, any recollection of their lives including birth<br>and death? It behoveth thee to tell me properly what the truth is in<br>respect, O thou of Kuru's race. I do not think it proper to question any<br>one else than thee! Observing the scriptures bearing upon Emancipation, I<br>find this great fault in the subject (for certain scriptures on the topic<br>declare that consciousness disappears in the emancipate state, while<br>other scriptures declare the very reverse of this). If, having attained<br>to this high state, the Yatis continue to live in consciousness, it would<br>seem. O king, that the religion of Pravritti is superior. If, again,<br>consciousness disappears from the emancipate state and one who has become<br>emancipate only resembles a person sunk in dreamless slumber, then<br>nothing can be more improper than to say that there is really no<br>consciousness in Emancipation (for of all that happens in dreamless<br>slumber is that one's consciousness is temporarily overshadowed and<br>suspended, but never lost, for it returns when one awakes from that<br>slumber).'[1593]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'However difficult it may be to answer it, the question<br>which thou hast asked, O son, is proper. Verily, the question is of such<br>a kind that even they that are possessed of great learning become<br>stupefied in answering it, O chief of Bharata's race. For all that, hear<br>what the truth is as expounded by me. The high-souled followers of Kapila<br>have set their high understandings on this point. The senses of<br>knowledge, O King, planted in the bodies of embodied creatures, are<br>employed in their respective functions of perception. They are the<br>instruments of the Soul, for it is through them that subtile Being<br>perceives.[1594] Disunited with the Soul, the senses are like lumps of<br>wood, and are without doubt, destroyed (in respect of the functions they<br>serve) like the froth that is seen on the bosom of the ocean.[1595] When<br>the embodied creature, O scorcher of foes, sinks into sleep along with<br>his senses, the subtile Soul then roves among all subjects like the wind<br>through space.[1596] The subtile Soul, during slumber, continues to see<br>(all forms) and touch all objects of touch, O king, and taken in other<br>perceptions, as well as when it is awake. In consequence of their<br>inability to act without their director, the senses, during sleep, all<br>become extinguished in their respective places (and lose their powers)<br>like snakes deprived of poison.[1597] At such times, the subtile Soul,<br>repairing into the respective place of all the senses, without doubt,<br>discharges all their functions.[1598] All the qualities of Sattwa, all<br>the attributes of the Under-standing, O Bharata, as also those of Mind,<br>and space, and Wind, O thou of righteous soul, and all the attributes of<br>liquid substances, of Water, O Partha, and Of Earth,&#8212;these senses with<br>these qualities,&#8212;O Yudhishthira, which inhere to Jiva-souls, are along<br>with the Jiva-soul itself, overwhelmed by the Supreme Soul or Brahma.<br>Acts also, good and bad, overwhelm that Jiva-soul. Like disciples waiting<br>upon their preceptor with reverence, the senses too wait upon the<br>Jiva-soul transcends Prakriti, it attains to Brahma that is without<br>change, that is highest, that is Narayana, that is beyond all pairs of<br>opposites, and that transcends Prakriti. Freed from both merit and<br>demerit, the Jiva-soul entering the Supreme Soul which is divested of all<br>attributes, and which is the home of all auspiciousness, does not return<br>thence, O Bharata. What remains, O son, is the mind with the senses, O<br>Bharata. These have to come back once more at the appointed season for<br>doing the bidding of their great master.[1599] Soon after, O son of<br>Kunti, (when this body is cast off) the Yati striving after Emancipation,<br>endued as he is with knowledge and desirous as he is of Guna, succeeds in<br>attaining to that Peace of Emancipation which is his who becomes<br>bodiless.[1600] [1601] The Sankhyas, O king, are endued with great<br>wisdom. They succeed in attaining to the highest end by means of this<br>kind of knowledge. There is no knowledge that is equal to this. Do not<br>yield to any kind of doubt. The knowledge which is described in the<br>system of the Sankhyas is regarded as the highest. That knowledge is<br>immutable and is eternally fixed. It is eternal Brahma in fulness. It has<br>no beginning, middle and end. It transcends all pairs of opposites. It is<br>the cause of the creation of the universe. It stands in fulness. It is<br>without deterioration of any kind. It is uniform, and everlasting. Thus<br>are its praises sung by the wise. From it flow creation and destruction<br>and all modifications. The great Rishis speak of it and applaud it in the<br>scriptures. All learned Brahmanas and all righteous men regard it as<br>flowing from Brahma, Supreme, Divine, Infinite, Immutable, and<br>Undeteriorating. All Brahmanas again that are attached to objects of the<br>senses adore and applaud it by ascribing to it attributes that belong to<br>illusion.[1602] The same is the view of Yogins well observant of penances<br>and meditation and of Sankhyas of immeasureable insight. The Srutis<br>declare, O son of Kunti, that the Sankhya form of philosophy is the form<br>of that Formless one. The cognitions (according to that philosophy) have,<br>O chief of Bharata's race, been said to be the knowledge of Brahma.[1603]<br><br>"There are two kinds of creatures on Earth, O lord of Earth, viz., mobile<br>and immobile. Of these that are mobile are superior, That high knowledge,<br>O king, which exists in persons conversant with Brahma, and that which<br>occurs in the Vedas, and that which is found in other scriptures, and<br>that in Yoga, and that which may be seen in the diverse Puranas, are all,<br>O monarch, to be found in Sankhya philosophy.[1604] Whatever knowledge is<br>seen to exist in high histories whatever knowledge occurs, O king, in the<br>sciences appertaining to the acquisition of wealth as approved by the<br>wise, whatever other knowledge exists in this world,&#8212;all these,&#8212;flow, O<br>high-souled monarch, from the high knowledge that occurs among the<br>Sankhyas. Tranquillity of soul, high puissance, all subtile knowledge of<br>which the scriptures speak, penances of subtile force, and all kinds of<br>felicity, O king, have all been duly ordained in the Sankhya system.<br>Failing to acquire, O son of Pritha, that complete knowledge which is<br>recommended by their system, the Sankhyas attain to the status of deities<br>and pass many years in felicity. Lording it over the celestials as they<br>will, they fall, upon the expiration of the allotted period, among<br>learned Brahmanas and Yatis.[1605] Casting off this body, those<br>regenerate ones that follow the Sankhya system enter into the superior<br>state of Brahma like the celestials entering into the firmament by<br>devoting themselves wholly to that adorable system which is theirs and<br>which is worshipped by all wise men. Those regenerate persons that are<br>devoted to the acquisition of that knowledge which is recommended in the<br>Sankhya system, even if they fail to attain to eminence, are never seen<br>to fall among intermediate creatures, or to sink into the status of<br>sinful men. That high-souled person who is fully conversant with the<br>vast, high, ancient, ocean-like, and immeasurable Sankhya system that is<br>pure and liberal and agreeable, becomes, O king, equal to Narayana. I<br>have now told thee, O god among men, the truth about the Sankhya system.<br>It is the embodiment of Narayana, of the universe as it exists from the<br>remotest time.[1606] When the time of Creation comes, He causes the<br>Creation to start into life, and when the time comes for destruction, He<br>swallows up everything. Having withdrawn everything into his own body he<br>goes to sleep,&#8212;that inner Soul of the universe.'"[1607]
