                            "Parasara said, 'I have now discoursed to thee on what the ordinances are<br>of the duties in respect of one that leads the domestic mode of life. I<br>shall now speak to thee of the ordinances about penances. Listen to me as<br>I discourse on the topic. It is generally seen, O king, that in<br>consequence of sentiments fraught with Rajas and Tamas, the sense of<br>meum, born of attachment, springs up in the heart of the householder.<br>Betaking oneself to the domestic mode of life, one acquires kine, fields,<br>wealth of diverse kinds, spouses, children, and servants. One that<br>becomes observant of this mode of life continually casts one's eye upon<br>these objects. Under these circumstances, one's attachments and aversions<br>increase, and one ceases to regard one's (transitory) possessions as<br>eternal and indestructible. When a person becomes overwhelmed by<br>attachment and aversion, and yields himself up to the mastery of earthly<br>objects, the desire of enjoyment then seizes him, taking its rise from<br>heedlessness, O king. Thinking that person to be blessed who has the<br>largest share of enjoyments in this world, the man devoted to enjoyment<br>does not, in consequence of his attachment thereto, see that there is any<br>other happiness besides what waits upon the gratification of the senses.<br>Overwhelmed with cupidity that results from such attachment, he then<br>seeks to increase the number of his relatives and attendants, and for<br>gratifying these latter he seeks to increase his wealth by every means in<br>his power. Filled with affection for children, such a person commits, for<br>the sake of acquiring wealth, acts that he knows to be evil, and gives<br>way to grief if his wealth be lost. Having earned honours and always<br>guarding against the defeat of his plans, he betakes himself to such<br>means as would gratify his desire of enjoyment. At last he meets with<br>destruction as the inevitable consequence of the conduct he pursues. It<br>is well-known, however, that true felicity is theirs that a e endued with<br>intelligence, that are utterers of the eternal Brahma, that seek to<br>accomplish only acts that are auspicious and beneficial, and that abstain<br>from all acts that are optional and spring from desire alone.[1532] From<br>loss of all such objects in which are centred our affections, from loss<br>of wealth, O king, and from the tyranny of physical diseases add mental<br>anguish, a person falls into despair. From this despair arises art<br>awakening of the soul. From such awakening proceeds study of the<br>Scriptures. From contemplation of the import of the scriptures, O king,<br>one sees the value of penance. A person possessed of the knowledge of<br>what is essential and what accidental, O king, is very rare,&#8212;he, that<br>is, who seeks to undergo penances, impressed with the truth that the<br>happiness one derives from the possession of such agreeable objects as<br>spouses and children leads ultimately to misery.[1533] Penances, O child,<br>are for all. They are ordained for even the lowest order of men (viz.,<br>Sudras). Penances set the self-restrained man having the mastery over all<br>his senses on the way to heaven. It was through penances that the<br>puissant Lord of all creatures, O, king, observing vows at particular<br>intervals created all existent objects. The Adityas, the Vasus, the<br>Rudras, Agni, the Aswins, the Maruts, the Viswedevas, the Saddhyas, the<br>Pitris, the Maruts, the Yakshas, the Rakshasas, the Gandharvas, the<br>Siddhas and the other denizens of heaven, and, indeed, all other<br>celestials whatever, O child, have all been crowned with success through<br>their penances. Those Brahmanas whom Brahmana created at the outset,<br>succeeded through their penances in honouring not the Earth alone but the<br>heaven also in which they roved at pleasure. In this world of mortals,<br>they that are kings, and those others that are householders born in high<br>families, have all become what they are only in consequence of their<br>penances.[1534] The silken robes they wear, the excellent ornaments that<br>adorn their persons, the animals and vehicles they ride, and the seats<br>they use are all the result of their penances. The many charming and<br>beautiful women, numbering by thousands, that they enjoy, and their<br>residence in palatial mansions, are all due to their penances. Costly<br>beds and diverse kinds of delicious viands become theirs that act<br>righteously. There is nothing in the three worlds, O scorcher of foes,<br>that penances cannot attain. Even those that are destitute of true<br>knowledge win Renunciation as the consequence of their penances.[1535]<br>Whether in affluent circumstances or miserable, a person should cast off<br>cupidity, reflecting on the scriptures, with the aid of his Mind and<br>understanding, O best of kings. Discontent is productive of misery.<br>(Discontent is the result of cupidity). Cupidity leadeth to the<br>stupefaction of the senses. The senses being stupefied, one's wisdom<br>disappears like knowledge not kept up by continued application. When<br>one's wisdom disappears, one fails to discriminate what is proper from<br>what is improper. Hence, when one's happiness is destroyed (and one<br>becomes subject to misery) one should practise the austerest of<br>penances.[1536] That which is agreeable is called happiness. That which<br>is disagreeable is said to be misery. When penances are practised, the<br>result is happiness. When they are not practised, the result is misery.<br>Behold the fruits of practising and abstaining from penances![1537] By<br>practising stainless penances, people always meet with auspicious<br>consequences of every kind, enjoy all good things, and attain to great<br>fame.[1538] He, however, who by abandoning (stainless penances), betakes<br>himself to penances from desire of fruit, meets with many disagreeable<br>consequences, and disgrace and sorrow of diverse kinds, as the fruits<br>thereof, all of which have worldly possessions for their cause.[1539]<br>Notwithstanding the desirability of practising righteousness, penances,<br>and gifts, the wish springs up in his mind of accomplishing all kinds of<br>forbidden acts. By thus perpetrating diverse kinds of sinful acts, he<br>goes to hell.[1540] That person, O best of men, who, in both happiness<br>and misery, does not fall away from the duties ordained for him, is said<br>to have the scriptures for his eye. It is said that the pleasure one<br>derives from the gratification of one's senses of touch, tongue, sight,<br>scent, and hearing, O monarch, lasts only so long as a shaft urged from<br>the bow takes in falling down upon the earth. Upon the cessation of that<br>pleasure, which is so short-lived, one experiences the most keen agony.<br>It is only the senseless that do not applaud the felicity of Emancipation<br>that is unrivalled. Beholding the misery that attends the gratification<br>of the senses, they that are possessed of wisdom cultivate the virtues of<br>tranquillity and self-restraint for the purpose of attaining to<br>Emancipation. In consequence of their righteous behaviour, wealth, and<br>pleasure can never succeed in afflicting them.[1541] Householders may,<br>without any compunction, enjoy wealth and other possessions that are<br>obtained without Exertion. As regards, however, the duties of their order<br>that are laid down in the scriptures, these, I am of opinion, they should<br>discharge with the aid of Exertion.[1542] The practice of those that are<br>honoured, that are born in high families, and that have their eyes always<br>turned towards the import of the scriptures, is incapable of being<br>followed by those that are sinful and that are possessed of unrestrained<br>minds. All acts that are done by man under the influence of vanity, meet<br>with destruction. Hence, for them that are respectable and truly<br>righteous there is no other act in this world to do than penance.[1543]<br>As regards, those house-holders, however, that are addicted to acts, they<br>should, with their whole hearts, set themselves to acts. Following the<br>duties of their order, O king, they should with cleverness and attention<br>perform sacrifices and other religious rites. Indeed, as all rivers, male<br>and female, have their refuge in the Ocean, even so men belonging to all<br>the other orders have their refuge in the householder.'"
