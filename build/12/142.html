                            "Yudhishthira said, 'If that which is so horrible and which like<br>falsehood should never be an object of regard, be cited (as duty), then<br>what act is there from which I should forbear? Why also should not<br>robbers then be respected? I am stupefied! My heart is pained! All the<br>ties that bind me to morality are loosened! I cannot tranquillise my mind<br>and venture to act in the way suggested by you.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I do not instruct thee in respect of duty, taught by what<br>I have heard from the Vedas alone. What I have told thee is the result of<br>wisdom and experience. This is the honey that the learned have gathered.<br>Kings should gather wisdom from various sources. One cannot accomplish<br>his course through the world with the aid of a morality that is<br>one-sided. Duty must spring from the understanding; and the practices of<br>those that are good should always be ascertained, O son of Kuru! Attend<br>to these words of mine. Only kings that are possessed of superior<br>intelligence can rule, expecting victory. A king should provide for the<br>observance of morality by the aid of his understanding and guided by<br>knowledge derived from various sources. The duties of a king can never be<br>discharged by rules drawn from a morality that is one-sided. A<br>weak-minded king can never display wisdom (in the discharge of his<br>duties) in consequence of his not having drawn any wisdom from the<br>examples before him. Righteousness sometimes takes the shape of<br>unrighteousness. The latter also sometimes takes the shape of the former.<br>He who does not know this, becomes confounded when confronted by an<br>actual instance of the kind. Before the occasion comes, one should, O<br>Bharata, comprehend the circumstances under which righteousness and its<br>reverse become confused. Having acquired this knowledge, a wise king<br>should, when the occasion comes, act accordingly, aided by his judgment.<br>The acts he does at such a time are misunderstood by ordinary people.<br>Some persons are possessed of true knowledge. Some persons have false<br>knowledge. Truly ascertaining the nature of each kind of knowledge, a<br>wise king derives knowledge from them that are regarded as good. They<br>that are really breakers of morality find fault with the scriptures. They<br>that have themselves no wealth proclaim the inconsistencies of the<br>treatises on the acquisition of wealth. Those who seek to acquire<br>knowledge for the object only of carrying their sustenance by it, O king,<br>are sinful besides being enemies of morality. Wicked men, of immature<br>understandings, can never know things truly, even as persons unconversant<br>with scriptures are unable in all their acts to be guided by reason. With<br>eyes directed to the faults of the scriptures, they decry the scriptures.<br>Even if they understand the true meaning of the scriptures, they are<br>still in the habit of proclaiming that scriptural injunctions are<br>unsound. Such men, by decrying the knowledge of others proclaim the<br>superiority of their own knowledge. They have words for their weapons and<br>words for their arrows and speak as if they are real masters of their<br>sciences. Know, O Bharata, that they are traders in learning and<br>Rakshasas among men. By the aid of mere pretexts they cast off that<br>morality which has been established by good and wise men. It has been<br>heard by us that the texts of morality are not to be understood by either<br>discussion or one's own intelligence. Indra. himself has said that this<br>is the opinion of the sage Vrihaspati. Some are of opinion that no<br>scriptural text has been laid down without a reason. Others again, even<br>if they properly understand the scriptures, never act according to them.<br>One class of wise men declare that morality is nothing else than the<br>approved course of the world. The man of true knowledge should find out<br>for himself the morality laid down for the good. If even a wise man<br>speaks of morality under the influence of wrath or confusion of<br>understanding or ignorance, his deliverances go for nothing. Discourses<br>on morality made with the aid of an intelligence that is derived from the<br>true letter and spirit of the scriptures, are worthy of praise and not<br>those which are made with the help of anything else. Even the words heard<br>from an ignorant person, if in themselves they be fraught with sense,<br>come to be regarded as pious and wise. In days of old, Usanas said unto<br>the Daityas this truth, which should remove all doubts, that scriptures<br>are no scriptures if they cannot stand the test of reason. The possession<br>or absence of knowledge that is mixed with doubts is the same thing. It<br>behoves thee to drive off such knowledge after tearing it up by the<br>roots. He who does not listen to these words of mine is to be regarded as<br>one that has suffered himself to be misled. Dost thou not see that thou<br>wert created for the accomplishment of fierce deeds? Behold me, O dear<br>child, how, by betaking myself, to the duties of the order of my birth, I<br>have despatched innumerable Kshatriyas to heaven! There are some that are<br>not delighted with me for this. The goat, the horse and the Kshatriya<br>were created by Brahman for a similar purpose (viz., for being useful to<br>everybody). A Kshatriya, therefore, should incessantly seek the happiness<br>of all creatures. The sin that attaches to killing a person that should<br>not be killed is equal to that which is incurred by not killing one who<br>deserves to be killed. Even such is the established order of things which<br>a weak-minded king thinks of never attending to. Therefore, a king should<br>display severity in making all his subjects observe their respective<br>duties. If this is not done, they will prowl like wolves, devouring one<br>another. He is a wretch among Kshatriyas in whose territories robbers go<br>about plundering the property of other people like crows taking little<br>fishes from water. Appointing high-born men possessed of Vedic knowledge<br>as thy ministers, do thou govern the earth, protecting thy subjects<br>righteously. That Kshatriya who, ignorant of the established customs and<br>contrivances, improperly levies taxes upon his people, is regarded as a<br>eunuch of his order. A king should be neither severe nor mild. If he<br>rules righteously he deserves praise. A king should not cast off both the<br>qualities; on the other hand, becoming severe (on occasions demanding<br>severity), he should be mild when it is necessary to be so. Painful is<br>the observance of Kshatriya duties. I bear a great love for thee. Thou<br>art created for the accomplishment of severe acts. Therefore, do thou<br>rule thy kingdom. Sakra possessed of great intelligence has said that in<br>times of distress the great duty of a king is chastising the wicked and<br>protecting the good.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Is there any such rule (in respect of kingly duties)<br>which should, under no circumstances, be violated? I ask thee this, O<br>foremost of virtuous persons! Tell me, O grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'One should always worship Brahmanas venerable for<br>learning, devoted to penances, and rich in conduct conformable to the<br>injunctions of the Vedas. This indeed, is a high and sacred duty. Let thy<br>conduct towards the Brahmanas be always that which thou observest towards<br>the gods. The Brahmanas, if enraged, can inflict diverse kinds of wrong,<br>O king. If they be gratified, high fame will be thy share. If otherwise,<br>great will be thy fear. If gratified, the Brahmanas become like nectar.<br>If enraged, they become like poison.'"
