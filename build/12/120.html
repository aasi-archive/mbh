                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast, O Bharata, discoursed upon the many<br>duties of king-craft that were observed and laid down in days of old by<br>persons of ancient times conversant with kingly duties. Thou hast,<br>indeed, spoken in detail of those duties as approved by the wise. Do<br>thou, however, O bull of Bharata's race, speak of them in such a way that<br>one may succeed in retaining them in memory."[353]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The protection of all creatures is regarded as the<br>highest duty of the Kshatriya. Listen now to me, O king, as to how the<br>duty of protection is to be exercised. A king conversant with his duties<br>should assume many forms even as the peacock puts forth plumes of diverse<br>hues. Keenness, crookedness, truth, and sincerity, are the qualities that<br>should be present in him. With thorough impartiality, he should practise<br>the qualities of goodness if he is to earn felicity. He must assume that<br>particular hue or form which is beneficial in view of the particular<br>object which he seeks to accomplish.[354] A king who can assume diverse<br>forms succeeds in accomplishing even the most subtle objects. Dumb like<br>the peacock in autumn, he should conceal his counsel. He should speak<br>little, and the little he speaks should be sweet. He should be of good<br>features and well versed in the scriptures. He should always be heedful<br>in respect of those gates through which dangers may come and overtake<br>him, like men taking care of breaks in embankments through which the<br>waters of large tanks may rush and flood their fields and houses. He<br>should seek the refuge of Brahmanas crowned with ascetic success even as<br>men seek the refuge or loudly rivers generated by the rain-water<br>collected within mountain lakes. That king who desires to amass wealth<br>should act like religious hypocrites in the matter of keeping a coronal<br>lock.[355] The king should always have the rod of chastisement uplifted<br>in his hands. He should always act heedfully (in the matter of levying<br>his taxes) after examining the incomes and expenses of his subjects like<br>men repairing to a full-grown palmyra for drawing its juice.[356] He<br>should act equitably towards his own subjects; cause the crops of his<br>enemies to be crushed by the tread of his cavalry, march against foes<br>when his own wings have become strong; and observe all the sources of his<br>own weakness. He should proclaim the faults of his foes; crush those that<br>are their partisans; and collect wealth from outside like a person<br>plucking flowers from the woods. He should destroy those foremost of<br>monarchs that swell with might and stand with uplifted heads like<br>mountains, by seeking the shelter of unknown shades[357] and by<br>ambuscades and sudden attacks. Like the peacock in the season of rains,<br>he should enter his nightly quarters alone and unseen. Indeed, he should<br>enjoy, after the manner of the peacock, within his inner apartments, the<br>companionship of his wives. He should not put off his mail. He should<br>himself protect his own self, and avoid the nets spread out for him by<br>the spies and secret agents of his foes. He should also win over the<br>affections of the spies of his enemies, but extirpate them when<br>opportunity occurs. Like the peacocks the king should kill his powerful<br>and angry foes of crooked policy, and destroy their force and drive them<br>away from home. The king should also like the peacock do what is good to<br>him, and glean wisdom from everywhere as they collect insects even from<br>the forest. A wise and peacock-like king should thus rule his kingdom and<br>adopt a policy which is beneficial to him. By exercising his own<br>intelligence, he should settle what he is to do. By consulting with<br>others he should either abandon or confirm such resolution. Aided by that<br>intelligence which is sharpened by the scriptures, one can settle his<br>courses of action. In this consists the usefulness of the scriptures. By<br>practising the arts of conciliation, he should inspire confidence in the<br>hearts of his enemies. He should display his own strength. By judging of<br>different courses of action in his own mind he should, by exercising his<br>own intelligence, arrive at conclusions. The king should be well-versed<br>in the arts of conciliatory policy, he should be possessed of wisdom; and<br>should be able to do what should be done and avoid what should not. A<br>person of wisdom and deep intelligence does not stand in need of counsels<br>or instruction. A wise man who is possessed of intelligence like<br>Vrihaspati, if he incurs obloquy, goon regains his disposition like<br>heated iron dipped in water. A king should accomplish all objects, of his<br>own or of others, according to the means laid down in the scriptures. A<br>king conversant with the ways of acquiring wealth should always employ in<br>his acts such men as are mild indisposition, possessed of wisdom and<br>courage and great strength. Beholding his servants employed in acts for<br>which each is fit, the king should act in conformity with all of them<br>like the strings of a musical instrument, stretched to proper tension,<br>according with their intended notes. The king should do good to all<br>persons without transgressing the dictates of righteousness. That king<br>stands immovable as a hill whom everybody regards&#8212;'He is mine.' Having<br>set himself to the task of adjudicating between litigants, the king,<br>without making any difference between persons that are liked and those<br>that are disliked by him, should uphold justice. The king should appoint<br>in all his offices such men as are conversant with the characteristics of<br>particular families, of the masses of the people, and of different<br>countries; as are mild in speech; as are of middle age; as have no<br>faults; as are devoted to good act; as are never heedless; as are free<br>from rapacity; as are possessed of learning and self-restraint; as are<br>firm in virtue and always prepared to uphold the interests of both virtue<br>and profit. In this way, having ascertained the course of actions and<br>their final objects the king should accomplish them heedfully; and<br>instructed in all matters by his spies, he may live in cheerfulness. The<br>king who never gives way to wrath and joy without sufficient cause, who<br>supervises all his acts himself, and who looks after his income and<br>expenditure with his own eyes, succeeds in obtaining great wealth from<br>the earth. That king is said to be conversant with the duties of<br>king-craft who rewards his officers and subjects publicly (for any good<br>they do), who chastises those that deserve chastisement, who protects his<br>own self, and who protects his kingdom from every evil. Like the Sun<br>shedding his rays upon everything below, the king should always look<br>after his kingdom himself, and aided by his intelligence he should<br>supervise all his spies and officers. The king should take wealth from<br>his subjects at the proper time. He should never proclaim what he does.<br>Like an intelligent man milking his cow every day, the king should milk<br>his kingdom every day. As the bee collects honey from flowers gradually,<br>the king should draw wealth gradually from his kingdom for storing it.<br>Having kept apart a sufficient portion, that which remains should be<br>spent upon acquisition of religious merit and the gratification of the<br>desire for pleasure. That king who is acquainted with duties and who is<br>possessed of intelligence would never waste what has been stored. The<br>king should never disregard any wealth for its littleness; he should<br>never disregard foes for their powerlessness; he should, by exercising<br>his own intelligence, examine his own self; he should never repose<br>confidence upon persons destitute of intelligence. Steadiness,<br>cleverness, self-restraint, intelligence, health, patience, bravery, and<br>attention to the requirements of time and place,&#8212;these eight qualities<br>lead to the increase of wealth, be it small or be it much. A little fire,<br>fed with clarified butter, may blaze forth into a conflagration. A single<br>seed may produce a thousand trees. A king, therefore, even when he hears<br>that his income and expenditure are great, should not disregard the<br>smaller items. A foe, whether he happens to be a child, a young man, or<br>an aged one, succeeds in staying a person who is heedless. An<br>insignificant foe, when he becomes powerful, may exterminate a king. A<br>king, therefore, who is conversant with the requirements of time is the<br>foremost of all rulers. A foe, strong or weak, guided by malice, may very<br>soon destroy the fame of a king, obstruct the acquisition of religious<br>merit by him; and deprive him of even his energy. Therefore, a king that<br>is of regulated mind should never be heedless when he has a foe. If a<br>king possessed of intelligence desire affluence and victory, he should,<br>after surveying his expenditure, income, savings, and administration,<br>make either peace or war. For this reason the king should seek the aid of<br>an intelligent minister. Blazing intelligence weakens even a mighty<br>person; by intelligence may power that is growing be protected; a growing<br>foe is weakened by the aid of intelligence; therefore, every act that is<br>undertaken conformably to the dictates of intelligence is deserving of<br>praise. A king possessed of patience and without any fault, may, if he<br>likes, obtain the fruition of all his wishes, with the aid of even a<br>small force. That king, however, who wishes to be surrounded by a train<br>of self-seeking flatterers,[358] never succeeds in winning even the<br>smallest benefit. For these reasons.. the king should act with mildness<br>in taking wealth from his subjects. If a king continually oppresses his<br>people, he meets with extinction like a flash of lightening that blazes<br>forth only for a second. Learning, penances, vast wealth, indeed,<br>everything, can be earned by exertion. Exertion, as it occurs in embodied<br>creatures, is governed by intelligence. Exertion, therefore, should be<br>regarded as the foremost of all things. The human body is the residence<br>of many intelligent creatures of great energy, of Sakra, of Vishnu, of<br>Saraswati, and of other beings. A man of knowledge, therefore, should<br>never disregard the body.[359] A covetous man should be subjugated by<br>constant gifts. He that is covetous is never satiated with appropriating<br>other people's wealth. Every one, however, becomes covetous in the matter<br>of enjoying happiness. If a person, therefore, becomes destitute of<br>wealth, he becomes destitute of virtue and pleasure (which are objects<br>attainable by wealth). A covetous man seeks to appropriate the wealth,<br>the enjoyments, the sons and daughters, and the affluence of others. In<br>covetous men every kind of fault may be seen. The king, therefore, should<br>never take a covetous man for his minister or officer. A king (in the<br>absence of proper agents) should despatch even a low person for<br>ascertaining the disposition and acts of foes. A ruler possessed of<br>wisdom should frustrate all the endeavours and objects of his enemies.<br>That trustful and high-born king who seeks instruction from learned and<br>virtuous Brahmanas and who is protected by his ministers, succeeds in<br>keeping all his tributary chiefs under proper control. O prince of men, I<br>have briefly discoursed to thee of all the duties laid down in the<br>scriptures. Attend to them, aided by thy intelligence. That king who, in<br>obedience to his preceptor, attends to these, succeeds in ruling the<br>whole earth. That king who disregards the happiness that is derivable<br>from policy and seeks for that which chance may bring, never succeeds in<br>enjoying the happiness that attaches to sovereignty or in winning regions<br>of bliss hereafter.[360] A king that is heedful, by properly attending to<br>the requirements of war and peace, succeeds in slaying even such foes as<br>are eminent for wealth, worshipped for intelligence and good conduct,<br>possessed of accomplishments, brave in battle, and ready for exertion.<br>The king should discover those means which are furnished by different<br>kinds of acts and measures. He should never depend upon destiny. One that<br>sees faults in faultless persons never succeeds in winning prosperity and<br>fame. When two friends engage in accomplishing one and the same act, a<br>wise man always applauds him among the two that takes upon himself the<br>heavier share of the work. Do thou practise these duties of kings that I<br>have told thee. Set thy heart upon the duty of protecting men. Thou mayst<br>then easily obtain the reward of virtue. All the regions of felicity<br>hereafter are dependent upon merit!'"[361]
