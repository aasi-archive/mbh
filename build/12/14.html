                            Vaisampayana said, "When Kunti's son, king Yudhishthira the just,<br>remained speechless after listening to his brothers who were telling<br>these truths of the Vedas, that foremost of women, viz., Draupadi, of<br>large eyes and great beauty, and noble descent, O monarch, said these<br>words unto that bull among kings seated in the midst of his brothers that<br>resembled so many lions and tigers, and like the leader in the midst of a<br>herd of elephants. Ever expectant of loving regards from all her husbands<br>but especially from Yudhishthira, she was always treated with affection<br>and indulgence by the king. Conversant with duties and observant of them<br>in practice, that lady of large hips, casting her eyes on her lord,<br>desired his attention in shooting and sweet words and said as follows.<br><br>"Draupadi said, These thy brothers, O Partha, are crying and drying their<br>palates like chatakas but thou dost not gladden them.. O monarch, gladden<br>these thy brothers, that resemble infuriated elephants (in prowess), with<br>proper words,&#8212;these heroes that have always drunk of the cup of misery.<br>Why, O king, while living by the side of the Dwaita lake, didst thou say<br>unto these thy brothers then residing with thee, and suffering from cold<br>and wind and sun, even these words, viz.,&#8212;' rushing to battle from.<br>desire of victory, we will slay Duryodhana and enjoy the earth that is<br>capable of granting every wish. Depriving great car-warriors of their<br>cars and slaying huge elephants, and strewing the field of battle with<br>the bodies of car-warriors and horsemen and heroes, ye chastisers of<br>foes, ye will perform great sacrifices of diverse kinds with presents in<br>profusion. All these sufferings, due to a life of exile in the woods,<br>will then end in happiness.' O foremost of all practisers of virtue,<br>having thyself said these words unto thy brothers then, why, O hero, dost<br>thou depress our hearts now? A eunuch can never enjoy wealth. A eunuch<br>can never have children even as there can be no fish in a mire (destitute<br>of water). A Kshatriya without the rod of chastisement can never shine. A<br>Kshatriya without the rod of chastisement can never enjoy the earth. The<br>subjects of a king that is without the rod of chastisement can never have<br>happiness. Friendship for all creatures, charity, study of the Vedas,<br>penances,&#8212;these constitute the duties of a Brahmana and not of a king, O<br>best of kings! Restraining the wicked, cherishing the honest, and never<br>retreating from battle,&#8212;these are the highest duties of kings. He is<br>said to be conversant with duties in whom are forgiveness and wrath,<br>giving and taking, terrors and fearlessness, and chastisement and reward.<br>It was not by study, or gift, or mendicancy, that thou hast acquired the<br>earth. That force of the enemy, O hero, ready to burst upon thee with all<br>its might, abounding with elephants and horse and cars, strong with three<br>kinds of strength[32] protected by Drona and Karna and Aswatthaman and<br>Kripa, has been defeated and slain by thee, O hero! It is for this that I<br>ask thee to enjoy the earth. Formerly, O puissant one, thou hadst, O<br>monarch, swayed with might,[33] the region called Jambu, O tiger among<br>men, abounding with populous districts. Thou hadst also, O ruler of men,<br>swayed with might that other region called Kraunchadwipa situate on the<br>west of the great Meru and equal unto Jambu-dwipa itself. Thou hadst<br>swayed with might, O king, that other region called Sakadwipa on the east<br>of the great Meru and equal to Krauncha-dwipa itself. The region called<br>Bhadraswa, on the north of the great Meru and equal to Sakadwipa was also<br>swayed by thee, O tiger, among men! Thou hadst even penetrated the ocean<br>and swayed with might other regions, too, O hero, and the very islands<br>begirt by the sea and containing many populous provinces. Having, O<br>Bharata, achieved such immeasurable feats, and having obtained (through<br>them) the adorations of the Brahmanas, how is it that thy soul is not<br>gratified? Seeing these brothers of thine before thee, O Bharata,&#8212;these<br>heroes swelling with might and resembling bulls or infuriated elephants<br>(in prowess),&#8212;why dost thou not address them in delightful words? All of<br>you are like celestials. All of you are capable of resisting foes. All of<br>you are competent to scorch your enemies. If only one of you had become<br>my husband, my happiness would even then have been very great. What need<br>I say then, O tiger among men, when all of you, numbering five, are my<br>husbands (and look after me) like the five senses inspiring the physical<br>frame? The words of my mother-in-law who is possessed of great knowledge<br>and great foresight, cannot be untrue. Addressing me, she said, 'O<br>princess of Panchala, Yudhishthira will ever keep you in happiness, O<br>excellent lady! Having slain many thousands of kings possessed of active<br>prowess, I see, O monarch, that through thy folly thou art about to make<br>that feat futile. They whose eldest brother becomes mad, have all to<br>follow him in madness. Through thy madness, O king, all the Pandavas are<br>about to become mad. If, O monarch, these thy brothers were in their<br>senses, they would then have immured thee with all unbelievers (in a<br>prison) and taken upon themselves the government of the earth. That<br>person who from dullness of intellect acts in this way never succeeds in<br>winning prosperity. The man that treads along the path of madness should<br>be subjected to medical treatment by the aid of incense and collyrium, of<br>drugs applied through the nose, and of other medicines. O best of the<br>Bharatas, I am the worst of all my sex, since I desire to live on even<br>though I am bereaved of my children. Thou shouldst not disregard the<br>words spoken by me and by these brothers of thine that are endeavouring<br>thus (to dissuade thee from thy purpose). Indeed, abandoning the whole<br>earth, thou art inviting adversity and danger to come upon thee. Thou<br>shinest now, O monarch, even as those two best of kings, viz., Mandhatri<br>and Amvarisha, regarded by all the lords of earth, did in former days.<br>Protecting thy subjects righteously, govern the goddess Earth with her<br>mountains and forests and islands. Do not, O king, become cheerless.<br>Adore the gods in diverse sacrifices. Fight thy foes. Make gifts of<br>wealth and clothes and other objects of enjoyment unto the Brahmanas, O<br>best of kings!'
