                            (Mokshadharma Parva)<br><br>"YUDHISHTHIRA SAID, 'THOU hast, O grandsire, discoursed upon the<br>auspicious duties (of person in distress) connected with the duties of<br>kings. It behoveth thee now, O king, to tell me those foremost of duties<br>which belong to those who lead the (four) modes of life.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Religion hath many doors. The observance of (the duties<br>prescribed by) religion can never be futile. Duties have been laid down<br>with respect to every mode of life. (The fruits of those duties are<br>invisible, being attainable in the next world.) The fruits, however, of<br>Penance directed towards the soul are obtainable in this world.[500]<br>Whatever be the object to which one devotes oneself, that object, O<br>Bharata, and nothing else, appears to one as the highest of acquisitions<br>fraught with the greatest of blessings. When one reflects properly (one's<br>heart being purified by such reflection), one comes to know that the<br>things of this world are as valueless as straw. Without doubt, one is<br>then freed from attachment in respect of those things. When the world, O<br>Yudhishthira, which is full of defects, is so constituted, every man of<br>intelligence should strive for the attainment of the emancipation of his<br>soul.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, by what frame of soul should<br>one kill one's grief when one loses one's wealth, or when one's wife, or<br>son, or sire, dies.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'When one's wealth is lost, or one's wife or son or sire<br>is dead, one certainly says to oneself 'Alas, this is a great sorrow!'<br>But then one should, by the aid of reflection, seek to kill that sorrow.<br>In this connection is cited the old story of the speech that a regenerate<br>friend of his, coming to Senajit's court, made to that king. Beholding<br>the monarch agitated with grief and burning with sorrow on account of the<br>death of his son, the Brahmana addressed that ruler of very cheerless<br>heart and said these words, 'Why art thou stupefied? Thou art without any<br>intelligence. Thyself an object of grief, why dost thou grieve (for<br>others)? A few days hence others will grieve for thee, and in their turn<br>they will be grieved for by others. Thyself, myself, and others who wait<br>upon thee, O king, shall all go to that place whence all of us have come.'<br><br>"Senajit said, 'What is that intelligence, what is that penance, O<br>learned Brahmana, what is that concentration of mind, O thou that hast<br>wealth of asceticism, what is that knowledge, and what is that learning,<br>by acquiring which thou dost not yield to sorrow?'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'Behold, all creatures,&#8212;the superior, the middling,<br>and the inferior,&#8212;in consequence of their respective acts, are entangled<br>in grief. I do not regard even my own self to be mine. On the other hand,<br>I regard the whole world to be mine. I again think that all this (which I<br>see) is as much mine as it belongs to others. Grief cannot approach me in<br>consequence of this thought. Having acquired such an understanding, I do<br>not yield either to joy or to grief. As two pieces of wood floating on<br>the ocean come together at one time and are again separated, even such is<br>the union of (living) creatures in this world. Sons, grandsons, kinsmen,<br>relatives are all of this kind. One should never feel affection for them,<br>for separation with them is certain. Thy son came from an invisible<br>region. He has departed and become invisible. He did not know thee. Thou<br>didst not know him. Who art thou and for whom dost thou grieve? Grieve<br>arises from the disease constituted by desire. Happiness again results<br>from the disease of desire being cured. From joy also springs sorrow, and<br>hence sorrow arises repeatedly. Sorrow comes after joy, and joy after<br>sorrow. The joys and sorrows of human beings are revolving on a wheel.<br>After happiness sorrow has come to thee. Thou shalt again have happiness.<br>No one suffers sorrow for ever, and no one enjoys happiness for ever. The<br>body is the refuge of both sorrow and happiness.[501] Whatever acts an<br>embodied creature does with the aid of his body, the consequence thereof<br>he has to suffer in that body. Life springs with the springing of the<br>body into existence. The two exist together, and the two perish<br>together.[502] Men of uncleansed souls, wedded to worldly things by<br>various bonds, meet with destruction like embankments of sand in water.<br>Woes of diverse kinds, born of ignorance, act like pressers of oil-seeds,<br>for assailing all creatures in consequence of their attachments. These<br>press them like oil-seeds in the oil-making machine represented by the<br>round of rebirths (to which they are subject). Man, for the sake of his<br>wife (and others), commits numerous evil acts, but suffers singly diverse<br>kinds of misery both in this and the next world. All men, attached to<br>children and wives and kinsmen and relatives, sink in the miry sea of<br>grief like wild elephants, when destitute of strength, sinking in a miry<br>slough. Indeed. O lord, upon loss of wealth or son or kinsmen or<br>relatives, man suffers great distress, which resembles as regards its<br>power of burning, a forest conflagration. All this, viz., joy and grief,<br>existence and non-existence, is dependent upon destiny. One having<br>friends as one destitute of friends, one having foes as one destitute of<br>foes, one having wisdom as one destitute of wisdom, each and every one<br>amongst these, obtains happiness through destiny. Friends are not the<br>cause of one's happiness. Foes are not the cause of one's misery. Wisdom<br>is not competent to bring an accession of wealth; nor is wealth competent<br>to bring an accession of happiness. Intelligence is not the cause of<br>wealth, nor is stupidity the cause of penury. He only that is possessed<br>of wisdom, and none else, understands the order of the world. Amongst the<br>intelligent, the heroic, the foolish, the cowardly, the idiotic, the<br>learned, the weak, or the strong, happiness comes to him for whom it is<br>ordained. Among the calf, the cowherd that owns her, and the thief, the<br>cow indeed belongs to him who drinks her milk.[503] They whose<br>understanding is absolutely dormant, and they who have attained to that<br>state of the mind which lies beyond the sphere of the intellect, succeed<br>in enjoying happiness. Only they that are between the two classes, suffer<br>misery.[504] They that are possessed of wisdom delight in the two<br>extremes but not in the states that are intermediate. The sages have said<br>that the attainment of any of these two extremes constitutes happiness.<br>Misery consists in the states that are intermediate between the two.[505]<br>They who have succeeded in attaining to real felicity (which samadhi can<br>bring), and who have become free from the pleasures and pains of this<br>world, and who are destitute of envy, are never agitated by either the<br>accession of wealth or its loss. They who have not succeeded in acquiring<br>that intelligence which leads to real felicity, but who have transcended<br>folly and ignorance (by the help of a knowledge of the scriptures), give<br>way to excessive joy and excessive misery. Men destitute of all notions<br>of right or wrong, insensate with pride and with success over others,<br>yield to transports of delight like the gods in heaven.[506] Happiness<br>must end in misery. Idleness is misery; while cleverness (in action) is<br>the cause of happiness. Affluence and prosperity dwell in one possessed<br>of cleverness, but not in one that is idle. Be it happiness or be it<br>misery, be it agreeable or be it disagreeable, what comes to one should<br>be enjoyed or endured with an unconquered heart. Every day a thousand<br>occasions for sorrow, and hundred occasions for fear assail the man of<br>ignorance and folly but not the man that is possessed of wisdom. Sorrow<br>can never touch the man that is possessed of intelligence, that has<br>acquired wisdom, that is mindful of listening to the instructions of his<br>betters, that is destitute of envy, and that is self-restrained. Relying<br>upon such an understanding, and protecting his heart (from the influences<br>of desire and the passions), the man of wisdom should conduct himself<br>here. Indeed, sorrow is unable to touch him who is conversant with that<br>Supreme Self from which everything springs and unto which everything<br>disappears.[507] The very root of that for which grief, or heartburning,<br>or sorrow is felt or for which one is impelled to exertion, should, even<br>if it be a part of one's body, be cast off. That object, whatever it may<br>be in respect of which the idea of meum is cherished, becomes a source of<br>grief and heart-burning. Whatever objects, amongst things that are<br>desired, are cast off become sources of happiness. The man that pursues<br>objects of desire meets with destruction in course of the pursuit.<br>Neither the happiness that is derived from a gratification of the senses<br>nor that great felicity which one may enjoy in heaven, approaches to even<br>a sixteenth part of the felicity which arises from the destruction of all<br>desires. The acts of a former life, right or wrong, visit, in their<br>consequences, the wise and the foolish, the brave and the timid. It is<br>even thus that joy and sorrow, the agreeable and the disagreeable,<br>continually revolve (as on a wheel) among living creatures. Relying upon<br>such an understanding, the man of intelligence and wisdom lives at ease.<br>A person should disregard all his desires, and never allow his wrath to<br>get the better of him. This wrath springs in the heart and grows there<br>into vigour and luxuriance. This wrath that dwells in the bodies of men<br>and is born in their minds, is spoken of by the wise as Death. When a<br>person succeeds in withdrawing all his desires like a tortoise<br>withdrawing all its limbs, then his soul, which is self-luminous,<br>succeeds in looking into itself.[508] That object, whatever it may be, in<br>respect of which the idea of meum is cherished, becomes a source of grief<br>and heart-burning.[509] When a person himself feels no fear, and is<br>feared by no one, when he cherishes no desire and no aversion, he is then<br>said to attain to the state of Brahma. Casting off both truth and<br>falsehood, grief and joy, fear and courage, the agreeable and the<br>disagreeable, thou mayst become of tranquil soul. When a person abstains<br>from doing wrong to any creature, in thought, word, or deed, he is then<br>said to attain to a state of Brahma. True happiness is his who can cast<br>off that thirst which is incapable of being cast off by the misguided,<br>which does not decay with decrepitude, and which is regarded as a fatal<br>disease. In this connection, O king, are heard the verses sung by Pingala<br>about the manner in which she had acquired eternal merit even at a time<br>that had been very unfavourable. A fallen woman of the name of Pingala,<br>having repaired to the place of assignation, was denied the company of<br>her lover through an accident. At that time of great misery, she<br>succeeded in acquiring tranquillity of soul.'<br><br>"Pingala said, 'Alas, I have for many long years lived, all the while<br>overcome by frenzy, by the side of that Dear Self in whom there is<br>nothing but tranquillity. Death has been at my door. Before this, I did<br>not, however approach that Essence of Purity. I shall cover this house of<br>one column and nine doors (by means of true Knowledge).[510] What woman<br>is there that regards that Supreme Soul as her dear lord, even when He<br>comes near?[511] I am now awake. I have been roused from the sleep of<br>ignorance. I am no longer influenced by desire. Human lovers, who are<br>really the embodied forms of hell, shall no longer deceive me by<br>approaching me lustfully. Evil produces good through the destiny or the<br>acts of a former life. Roused (from the sleep of ignorance), I have cast<br>off all desire for worldly objects. I have acquired a complete mastery<br>over my senses. One freed from desire and hope sleeps in felicity.<br>Freedom from every hope and desire is felicity. Having driven off desire<br>and hope, Pingala sleeps in felicity.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Convinced with these and other words uttered by the<br>learned Brahmana, king Senajit (casting off his grief), experienced<br>delight and became very happy.'"
