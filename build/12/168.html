                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, O thou that art possessed of great<br>wisdom, I shall ask thee a question. It behoveth thee, O enhancer of the<br>happiness of the Kurus, to discourse to me fully upon it. What kind of<br>men are said to be of gentle disposition? With whom may the most<br>delightful friendship exist? Tell us also who are able to do good in the<br>present time and in the end. I am of opinion that neither swelling<br>wealth, nor relatives, nor kinsmen, occupy that place which well-wishing<br>friends occupy. A friend capable of listening to beneficial counsels, and<br>also of doing good, is exceedingly rare. It behoveth thee, O foremost of<br>virtuous men, to discourse fully on these topics.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen to me, O Yudhishthira, as I speak to thee, in<br>detail, of those men with whom friendships may be formed and those with<br>whom friendships may not be formed. One that is covetous, one that is<br>pitiless, one that has renounced the duties of his order, one that is<br>dishonest, one that is a knave, one that is mean, one that is of sinful<br>practices, one that is suspicious of all, one that is idle, one that is<br>procrastinating, one that is of a crooked disposition, one that is an<br>object of universal obloquy, one that dishonours the life of his<br>preceptor, one that is addicted to the seven well-known vices, one that<br>casts off distressed friends, one possessed of a wicked soul, one that is<br>shameless, one whose sight is ever directed towards sin, one that is an<br>atheist, one that is a slanderer of the Vedas, one whose senses are not<br>restrained, one that gives free indulgence to lust, one that is<br>untruthful, one that is deserted by all, one that transgresses all<br>restraints, one that is deceitful, one that is destitute of wisdom, one<br>that is envious, one that is wedded to sin, one whose conduct is bad, one<br>whose soul has not been cleansed, one that is cruel, one that is a<br>gambler, one that always seeks to injure friends, one that covets wealth<br>belonging to others, that wicked-souled wight who never expresses<br>satisfaction with what another may give him according to the extent of<br>his means, one that is never pleased with his friends, O bull among men,<br>one that becomes angry on occasions that do not justify anger, one that<br>is of restless mind, one that quarrels without cause, that sinful bloke<br>who feels no scruple in deserting well-meaning friends, that wretch who<br>is always mindful of his own interests and who, O king, quarrels with<br>friends when those do him a very slight injury or inflict on him a wrong<br>unconsciously, one who acts like a foe but speaks like a friend, one who<br>is of perverse perceptions, one who is blind (to his own good), one who<br>never takes delight in what is good for himself or others, should be<br>avoided. One who drinks alcoholic liquors, one who hates others, one who<br>is wrathful, one who is destitute of compassion, one who is pained at the<br>sights of other's happiness, one who injures friends, one who is always<br>engaged in taking the lives of living creatures, one who is ungrateful,<br>one who is vile, should be avoided. Alliances (of friendship) should<br>never be formed with any of them. Similarly, no alliance (of friendship)<br>should be formed with him who is ever intent upon marking the faults of<br>others. Listen now to me as I indicate the persons with whom alliances<br>(of friendship) may be formed. They that are well-born, they that are<br>possessed of eloquence and politeness of speech, they that are endued<br>with knowledge and science, they that are possessed of merit and other<br>accomplishments, they that are free from covetousness, they that are<br>never exhausted by labour, they that are good to their friends, they that<br>are grateful, they that are possessed of varied information and<br>knowledge, they that are destitute of avarice, they that are possessed of<br>agreeable qualities, they that are firm in truth, they that have subdued<br>their senses, they that are devoted to athletic and other exercises, they<br>that are of good families, they that are perpetuators of their<br>races,[488] they that are destitute of faults, they that are possessed of<br>fame, should be accepted by kings for forming alliances (of friendship)<br>with them, They, again, O monarch, who become pleased and contented if<br>one behaves with them according to the best of one's powers, they who<br>never get angry on occasions that do not justify anger, they who never<br>become displeased without sufficient cause, those persons who are well<br>conversant with the science of Profit and who, even when annoyed, succeed<br>in keeping their minds tranquil, they who devote themselves to the<br>service of friends at personal sacrifice, they who are never estranged<br>from friends but who continue unchanged (in their attachment) like a red<br>blanket made of wool (which does not easily change its colour),[489] they<br>who never disregard, from anger, those that are poor, they who never<br>dishonour youthful women by yielding to lust and loss of judgment, they<br>who never point out wrong paths to friends, they who are trustworthy,<br>they who are devoted to the practice of righteousness, they who regard<br>gold and brick-bats with an equal eye, they that adhere with firmness to<br>friends and well-wishers, they who muster their own people and seek the<br>accomplishment of the business of friends regardless of their own dignity<br>and casting off all the marks of their own respectability, should be<br>regarded as persons with whom alliances (of friendship) should be made.<br>Indeed, the dominions of that king spread on every direction, like the<br>light of the lord of the stars, who makes alliances of friendship with<br>such superior men. Alliances should be formed with men that are<br>well-practised in weapons, that have completely subdued their anger, that<br>are always strong in battle and possessed of high birth, good behaviour,<br>and varied accomplishments. Amongst those vicious men, O sinless one,<br>that I have mentioned, the vilest, O king, are those that are ungrateful<br>and that injure friends. Those persons of wicked behaviour should be<br>avoided by all. This, indeed, is a settled conclusion.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'I desire to hear in detail this description. Tell me<br>who they are that are called injurers of friends and ungrateful persons.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall recite to thee an old story whose incidents<br>occurred in the country, O monarch, of the Mlecchas that lies to the<br>north. There was a certain Brahmana belonging to the middle country. He<br>was destitute of Vedic learning. (One day), beholding a prosperous<br>village, the man entered it from desire of obtaining charity.'[490] In<br>that village lived a robber possessed of great wealth, conversant with<br>the distinctive features of all the orders (of men), devoted to the<br>Brahmanas, firm in truth, and always engaged in my king gifts. Repairing<br>to the abode of that robber, the Brahmana begged for a alms. Indeed, he<br>solicited a house to live in and such necessaries of life as would last<br>for one year. Thus solicited by the Brahmana, the robber gave him a piece<br>of new cloth with its ends complete,[491] and a widowed woman possessed<br>of youth. Obtaining all those things from the robber, the Brahmana became<br>filled with delight. Indeed, Gautama began to live happily in that<br>commodious house which the robber assigned to him. He began to hold the<br>relatives and kinsmen of the female slave he had got from the robber<br>chief. In this way he lived for many years in that prosperous village of<br>hunters. He began to practise with great devotion the art of archery.<br>Every day, like the other robbers residing there, Gautama, O king, went<br>into the woods and slaughtered wild cranes in abundance. Always engaged<br>in slaughtering living creatures, he became well-skilled in that act and<br>soon bade farewell to compassion. In consequence of his intimacy with<br>robbers he became like one of them. As he lived happily in that robber<br>village for many months, large was the number of wild cranes that he<br>slew. One day another Brahmana came to that village. He was dressed in<br>rags and deer-skins and bore matted locks on his head. Of highly pure<br>behaviour, he was devoted to the study of the Vedas. Of a humble<br>disposition, frugal in fare, devoted to the Brahmanas, thoroughly<br>conversant with the Vedas, and observant of Brahmacharya vows, that<br>Brahmana had been a dear friend of Gautama and belonged to that part of<br>the country from which Gautama had emigrated. In course of his<br>wanderings, as already said, the Brahmana came to that robber village<br>where Gautama had taken up his abode. He never accepted any food if given<br>by a Sudra and, therefore, began to search for the house of a Brahmana<br>there (for accepting the duties of hospitality).[492] Accordingly he<br>wandered in every direction in that village teeming with robber-families.<br>At last that foremost of Brahmanas came to the house owned by Gautama. It<br>so happened that just at that time Gautama also, returning from the<br>woods, was entering his abode. The two friends met. Armed with bow and<br>sword, he bore on shoulders a load of slaughtered cranes, and his body<br>was smeared with the blood that trickled down from the bag on his<br>shoulders. Beholding that man who then resembled a cannibal and who had<br>fallen away from the pure practices of the order of his birth, entering<br>his house, the newly-arrived guest, recognising him, O king, said these<br>words: 'What is this that thou art doing here through folly? Thou art a<br>Brahmana, and the perpetuator of a Brahmana family. Born in a respectable<br>family belonging to the Middle country, how is it that thou becomest like<br>a robber in thy practices? Recollect, O regenerate one, thy famous<br>kinsmen of former times, all of whom were well-versed in the Vedas. Born<br>in their race, alas, thou hast become a stigma to it. Awake thyself by<br>thy own exertions. Recollecting the energy, the behaviour, the learning,<br>the self-restraint, the compassion (that are thine by the order of thy<br>birth), leave this thy present abode, O regenerate one!' Thus addressed<br>by that well-meaning friend of his, O king, Gautama answered him in great<br>affliction of heart, saying, O foremost of regenerate ones, I am poor. I<br>am destitute also of a knowledge of the Vedas. Know, O best of Brahmanas,<br>that I have taken up my abode here for the sake of wealth alone. At thy<br>sight, however, I am blest today. We shall together set out of this place<br>tomorrow. Do thou pass the night here with me. Thus addressed, the<br>newly-arrived Brahmana, full of compassion as he was, passed the night<br>there, refraining to touch anything. Indeed, though hungry and requested<br>repeatedly the guest refused to touch any food in that house.'"
