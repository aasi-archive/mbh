                            "Bhishma said, 'Upon the expiry of the period of full fifteen days, the<br>Naga chief (Padmanabha), having finished his task of dragging the car of<br>Surya and obtained the latter's permission, came back to his own house.<br>Beholding him come back, his spouse approached him quickly for washing<br>his feet and dutifully discharging other tasks of a similar nature.<br>Having gone through these tasks, she took her seat by his side, The Naga<br>then, refreshed from fatigue, addressed his dutiful and chaste wife,<br>saying, I hope, my dear wife, that during my absence thou hast not been<br>unmindful of worshipping the deities and guests agreeably to the<br>instructions I gave thee, and according to the ordinances laid down in<br>the scriptures. I hope, without yielding to that uncleansed understanding<br>which is natural to persons of thy sex, thou hast, during my absence from<br>home, been firm in the observance of the duties of hospitality. I trust<br>that thou hast not transcended the barriers of duty and righteousness.'<br><br>"The wife of the Naga said, 'The duty of disciples is to wait with<br>reverence upon their preceptor accomplishing his bidding; that of<br>Brahmanas is to study the Vedas and bear them in memory; that of servants<br>is to obey the commands of their masters; that of the king is to protect<br>his people by cherishing the good and chastising the wicked. It is said<br>that the duties of a Kshatriya embrace the protection of all creatures<br>from wrong and oppression. The duty of the Sudra is to serve with<br>humility persons of the three regenerate orders, viz., Brahmanas,<br>Kshatriyas and Vaisyas. The religion of the house-holder, O chief of the<br>Nagas, consists in doing good to all creatures. Frugality of fare and<br>observance of vow in due order, constitute merit (for persons of all<br>classes) in consequence of the connection that exists between the senses<br>and the duties of religion.[1933] Who am I? Whence have I come? What are<br>others to me and what am I to others?&#8212;these are the thoughts to which<br>the mind should ever be directed by him who leads that course of life<br>which leads to Emancipation. Chastity and obedience to the husband<br>constitute the highest duty of the wife. Through thy instruction, O chief<br>of the Nagas, I have learnt this well. I, therefore, that am well<br>conversant with my duty, and that have thee for my husband&#8212;thee that art<br>devoted to righteousness,&#8212;O, why shall I, swerving from the path of<br>duty, tread along the path of disobedience and sin? During thy absence<br>from home, the adorations to the deities have not fallen off in any<br>respect. I have also, without the slightest negligence, attended to the<br>duties of hospitality towards persons arrived as guests in thy abode.<br>Fifteen days ago a Brahmana has come here. He has not disclosed his<br>object to me. He desires to have an interview with thee. Dwelling the<br>while on the banks of the Gomati he is anxiously expecting thy return. Of<br>rigid vows, that Brahmana is sitting there, engaged in the recitation of<br>the Vedas. O chief of the Nagas, I have made a promise to him to the<br>effect that I would despatch thee to him as soon as thou wouldst come<br>back to thy abode. Hearing these words of mine, O best of Nagas, it<br>behoveth thee to repair thither. O thou that hearest with thy eyes, it<br>behoveth thee to grant unto that regenerate person the object that has<br>brought him hither!'"[1934]
