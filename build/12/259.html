                            "Yudhishthira said, 'All men that inhabit this earth are filled with<br>doubts in respect of the nature of righteousness. Who is this that is<br>called Righteousness? Whence also does Righteousness come? Tell me this,<br>O Grandsire! Is Righteousness for service in this world or is it for<br>service in the next world? Or, is it for service both here and hereafter?<br>Tell me this, O grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The practices of the good, the Smritis, and the Vedas,<br>are the three indications (sources) of righteousness. Besides these, the<br>learned have declared that the purpose (for which an act is accomplished)<br>is the fourth indication of righteousness.[1116] The Rishis of old have<br>declared what acts are righteous and also classified them as superior or<br>inferior in point of merit. The rules of righteousness have been laid<br>down for the conduct of the affairs of the world. In both the worlds,<br>that is, here and hereafter, righteousness produces happiness as its<br>fruits. A sinful person unable to acquire merit by subtile ways, becomes<br>stained with sin only. Some are of opinion that sinful persons can never<br>be cleansed of their sins. In seasons of distress, a person by even<br>speaking an untruth acquires the merit of speaking the truth, even as a<br>person who accomplishes an unrighteous act acquires by that very means<br>the merit of having done a righteous act. Conduct is the refuge of<br>righteousness. Thou shouldst know what righteousness is, aided by<br>conduct.[1117] (It is the nature of man that he neither sees nor<br>proclaims his own faults but notices and proclaims those of others). The<br>very thief, stealing what belongs to others, spends the produce of his<br>theft in acts of apparent virtue. During a time of anarchy, the thief<br>takes great pleasure in appropriating what belongs to others. When<br>others, however, rob him of what he has acquired by robbery, he then<br>wishes forthwith for a Icing (for invoking punishment on the head of the<br>offenders). At even such a time, when his indignation for offended rights<br>of property is at its highest, he secretly covets the wealth of those<br>that are contended with their own. Fearlessly and without a doubt in his<br>mind (when he is himself the victim of a robbery) he repairs to the<br>king's palace with a mind cleansed of every sin. Within even his own<br>heart he does not see the stain of any evil act.[1118] To speak the truth<br>is meritorious. There is nothing higher than truth. Everything is upheld<br>by truth, and everything rests upon truth. Even the sinful and ferocious,<br>swearing to keep the truth amongst themselves, dismiss all grounds of<br>quarrel and uniting with one another set themselves to their (sinful)<br>tasks, depending upon truth. If they behaved falsely towards one another,<br>they would then be destroyed without doubt. One should not take what<br>belongs to others. That is an eternal obligation. Powerful men regard it<br>as one that has been introduced by the weak. When, however, the destiny<br>of these men becomes adverse, this injunction then meets with their<br>approval. Then again they that surpass others in strength or prowess do<br>not necessarily become happy.[1119] Therefore, do not ever set thy heart<br>on any act that is wrong. One behaving in this way hath no fear of<br>dishonest men or thieves or the king. Not having done any injury to any<br>one, such a man lives fearlessly and with a pure heart. A thief fears<br>everybody, like a deer driven from the woods into the midst of an<br>inhabited village. He thinks other people to be as sinful as himself. One<br>that is of pure heart is always filled with cheerfulness and hath no fear<br>from any direction. Such a person never sees his own misconduct in<br>others.[1120] Persons engaged in doing good to all creatures have said<br>that the practice of charity is another high duty. They that are<br>possessed of wealth think that this duty has been laid down by those that<br>are indigent. When, however, those wealthy men meet with poverty in<br>consequence of some turn of fortune, the practice of charity then<br>recommends itself to them. Men that are exceedingly wealthy do not<br>necessarily meet with happiness.[1121] Knowing how painful it is to<br>himself, a person should never do that to others which he dislikes when<br>done to him by others.[1122] What can one who becomes the lover of<br>another man's wife say to another man (guilty of the same transgression)?<br>it is seen, however, that even such a one, when he sees his lady with<br>another lover, becomes unable to forgive the act.[1123] How can one who,<br>to draw breath himself think of preventing another by a murderous act,<br>from doing the same? Whatever wishes one entertains with respect to one's<br>ownself, one should certainly cherish with respect to another. With the<br>surplus wealth one may happen to own one should relieve the wants of the<br>indigent. It is for this reason that the Creator ordained the practice of<br>increasing one's wealth (by trade or laying it out at interest).[1124]<br>One should walk alone that path by proceeding along which one may hope to<br>meet with the deities; or, at such times when wealth is gained, adherence<br>to the duties of sacrifice and gift is laudable. [1125] The sages have<br>said that the accomplishment of the objects by means of agreeable<br>(pacific) means is righteousness. See, O Yudhishthira, that even this is<br>the criterion that has been kept in view in declaring the indications of<br>righteousness and iniquity.[1126] In days of old the Creator ordained<br>righteousness endowing it with the power of holding the world together.<br>The conduct of the good, that is fraught with excellence, is subjected to<br>(numerous) restraints for acquiring righteousness which depends upon many<br>delicate considerations. The indications of righteousness have now been<br>recounted to thee, O foremost one of Kuru's race! Do not, therefore, at<br>any time set thy understanding upon any act that is wrong.'"
