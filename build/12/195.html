                            "Bhishma said, 'I shall now, O son of Pritha, discourse to thee upon the<br>four kinds of yoga meditation. The great Rishis, obtaining a knowledge of<br>the same, attain to eternal success even here. Great Rishis gratified<br>with knowledge, with hearts set upon Emancipation, and conversant with<br>yoga, act in such a way that their yoga meditation may get on properly.<br>These, O son of Pritha, being freed from the faults of the world, never<br>come back (for rebirth). Liberated from liability to rebirth, they live<br>in their original Soul-state.[618] Freed from the influence of all pairs<br>of opposites (such as heat and cold, joy and sorrow, etc.), ever existing<br>in their own (original) state, liberated (from attachments), never<br>accepting anything (in gift), they live in places free from the<br>companionship of wives and children, without others with whom disputes<br>may arise, and favourable to perfect tranquillity of heart. There such a<br>person, restraining speech, sits like a piece of wood, crushing all the<br>senses, and with mind undividedly united by the aid of meditation (with<br>the Supreme Soul). He has no perception of sound through the ear; no<br>perception of touch through the skin; no perception of form through the<br>eye; no perception of taste through the tongue. He has no perception also<br>of scents through the organ of smell. Immersed in yoga, he would abandon<br>all things, rapt in meditation. Possessed of great energy of mind, he has<br>no desire for anything that excites the five senses. The wise man,<br>withdrawing his five senses into the mind, should then fix the unstable<br>mind with the five senses (into the Intellect). Possessed of patience,<br>the yogin should fix his mind which always wanders (among worldly<br>objects), so that his five gates (under the influence of training) may be<br>made stable in respect of things that are themselves unstable. He should,<br>in the firmament of the heart, fix his mind into the path of meditation,<br>making it independent of the body or any other refuge. I have spoken of<br>the path of meditation as the first, since the yogin has first to crush<br>his senses and the mind (and direct them to that path). The mind, which<br>constitutes the sixth, when thus restrained, seeks to flash out like the<br>capricious and flighty lightning moving in frolic among the clouds. As a<br>drop of water on a (lotus) leaf is unstable and moves about in all<br>directions, even so becomes the yogin's mind when first fixed on the path<br>of meditation. When fixed, for a while the mind stays in that path. When,<br>however, it strays again into the path of the wind, it becomes as flighty<br>as the wind. The person conversant with the ways of yoga-meditation,<br>undiscouraged by this, never regarding the loss of the toil undergone,<br>casting aside idleness and malice, should again direct his mind to<br>meditation. Observing the vow of silence, when one begins to set his mind<br>on yoga, then discrimination, knowledge, and power to avoid evil, are<br>gained by him.[619] Though feeling annoyed in consequence of the<br>flightiness of his mind, he should fix it (in meditation). The yogin<br>should never despair, but seek his own good. As a heap of dust or ashes;<br>or of burnt cow-dung, when drenched with water, does not seem to be<br>soaked, indeed, as it continues dry if drenched partially, and requires<br>incessant drenching before it becomes thoroughly soaked, even thus should<br>the yogin gradually control all his senses. He should gradually withdraw<br>them (from all objects). The man that acts in this way succeeds in<br>controlling them. One, O Bharata, by oneself directing one's mind and<br>senses to the path of meditation, succeeds in bringing them under perfect<br>control by steadfast yoga. The felicity that he feels who has succeeded<br>in controlling his mind and senses is such that its like can never be<br>obtained through Exertion or Destiny.[620] United with such felicity, he<br>continues to take a pleasure in the act of meditation. Even in this way<br>yogins attain to Nirvana which is highly blessed.'"
