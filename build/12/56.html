                            Vaisampayana said, 'Having bowed unto Hrishikesa, and saluted Bhishma,<br>and taken the permission of all the seniors assembled there, Yudhishthira<br>began to put questions unto Bhishma.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Persons conversant with duty and morality say that<br>kingly duties constitute the highest science of duty. I also think that<br>the burden of those duties is exceedingly onerous. Do thou, therefore, O<br>king, discourse on those duties. O grandsire, do thou speak in detail on<br>the duties of kings. The science of kingly duties is the refuge of the<br>whole world of life. O thou of Kuru's race, Morality, Profit, and<br>Pleasure are dependent on kingly duties. It is also clear that the<br>practices that lead to emancipation are equally dependent on them. As the<br>reins are in respect of the steed or the iron hook in respect of the<br>elephant, even so the science of kingly duties constitutes the reins for<br>checking the world. If one becomes stupefied in respect of the duties<br>observed by royal sages, disorder would set in on the earth and<br>everything will become confused. As the Sun, rising, dispels inauspicious<br>darkness, so this science destroys every kind of evil consequence in<br>respect of the world. Therefore, O grandsire, do thou, for my sake,<br>discourse on kingly duties in the first instance, for thou, O chief of<br>the Bharatas, art the foremost of all persons conversant with duties. O<br>scorcher of foes, Vasudeva regards thee as the first of all intelligent<br>persons. Therefore, all of us expect the highest knowledge from thee.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Bowing unto Dharma who is Supreme, unto Krishna who is<br>Brahma in full, and unto the Brahmanas, I shall discourse on the eternal<br>duties (of men). Hear from me, O Yudhishthira, with concentrated<br>attention, the whole range of kingly duties described with accurate<br>details, and other duties that you mayst desire to know. In the first<br>place, O foremost one of Kuru's race, the king should, from desire of<br>pleasing (his subjects), wait with humility upon the gods and the<br>Brahmanas, always bearing himself agreeably to the ordinance. By<br>worshipping the deities and the Brahmanas, O perpetuator of Kuru's race,<br>the king pays off his debt to duty and morality, and receives the respect<br>of his subjects. O son, thou shouldst always exert with promptitude, O<br>Yudhishthira, for without promptitude of exertion mere destiny never<br>accomplishes the objects cherished by kings. These two, viz., exertion<br>and destiny, are equal (in their operation). Of them, I regard exertion<br>to be superior, for destiny is ascertained from the results of what is<br>begun with exertion. Do not indulge in grief if what is commenced ends<br>disastrously, for thou shouldst then exert thyself in the same act with<br>redoubled attention. This is the high duty of kings. There is nothing<br>which contributes so much to the success of kings as Truth. The king who<br>is devoted to Truth finds happiness both here and hereafter. As regards<br>Rishis also, O king, Truth is their great wealth. Similarly, as regards<br>kings, there is nothing that so much inspires confidence in them as<br>Truth. The king that is possessed of every accomplishment and good<br>behaviour, that is self-restrained, humble, and righteous, that has his<br>passions under control, that is of handsome features and not too<br>enquiring,[161] never loses prosperity. By administering justice, by<br>attending to these three, viz., concealment of his own weaknesses,<br>ascertainment of the weaknesses of foes, and keeping his own counsels, as<br>also by the observance of conduct that is straightforward, the king, O<br>delighter of the Kurus, obtains prosperity. If the king becomes mild,<br>everybody disregards him On the other hand, if he becomes fierce, his<br>subjects then become troubled.<br><br>Therefore, do thou observe both kinds of behaviour. O foremost of liberal<br>men, the Brahmanas should never be punished by thee, for the Brahmana, O<br>son of Pandu, is the foremost of beings on the Earth. The high-souled<br>Manu, O king of kings, that sung two Slokas. In respect of thy duties, O<br>thou of Kuru's race, thou shouldst always bear them in mind. Fire hath<br>sprung from water, the Kshatriya from the Brahmana, and iron from stone.<br>The three (viz., fire, Kshatriya and iron) can exert their force on every<br>other thing, but coming into contact with their respective progenitors,<br>their force becomes neutralised. When iron strikes stone, or fire battles<br>with water, or Kshatriya cherishes enmity towards Brahmana, these three<br>soon become weak. When this is so, O monarch, (you will see that) the<br>Brahmanas are worthy of worship. They that are foremost among the<br>Brahmanas are gods on earth. Duly worshipped, they uphold the Vedas and<br>the Sacrifices. But they, O tiger among kings, that desire to have such<br>honour however much they may be impediments to the three worlds, should<br>ever be repressed by the might of thy arms. The great Rishi Usanas, O<br>son, sang two Slokas in days of old. Listen to them, O king, with<br>concentrated attention. The righteous Kshatriya, mindful of his duties,<br>should chastise a Brahmana that may be a very master of the Vedas if he<br>rushes to battle with an uplifted weapon. The Kshatriya, conversant with<br>duties, that upholds righteousness when it is trespassed against, does<br>not, by that act, become a sinner, for the wrath of the assailant<br>justifies the wrath of the chastiser. Subject to these restrictions, O<br>tiger among kings, the Brahmanas should be protected. If they become<br>offenders, they should then be exiled beyond thy dominions. Even when<br>deserving of punishment, thou shouldst, O kings, show them compassion. If<br>a Brahmana becomes guilty of Brahmanicide, or of violating the bed of his<br>preceptor or other revered senior, or of causing miscarriage, or of<br>treason against the king, his punishment should be banishment from thy<br>dominions. No corporal chastisement is laid down for them. Those persons<br>that show respect towards the Brahmanas should be favoured by thee (with<br>offices in the state). There is no treasure more valuable to kings than<br>that which consists in the selection and assemblage of servants. Among<br>the six kinds of citadels indicated in the scriptures, indeed among every<br>kind of citadel, that which consists of (the ready service and the love<br>of the) subjects is the most impregnable. Therefore, the king who is<br>possessed of wisdom should always show compassion towards the four orders<br>of his subjects. The king who is of righteous soul and truthful speech<br>succeeds in gratifying his subjects. Thou must not, however, O son always<br>behave with forgiveness towards everybody, for the king that is mild is<br>regarded as the worst of his kind like an elephant that is reft of<br>fierceness. In the scriptures composed by Vrihaspati, a Sloka was in days<br>of old applicable to the present matter. Hear it, O king as I recite it.<br>'If the king happens to be always forgiving, the lowest of persons<br>prevails over him, even as the driver who sits on the head of the<br>elephant he guides.' The king, therefore, should not always be mild. Nor<br>should he always be fierce. He should be like the vernal Sun, neither<br>cold nor so hot as to produce perspiration. By the direct evidence of the<br>senses, by conjecture, by comparisons, and by the canons, of the<br>scriptures O monarch, the king should Study friends and foes. O thou of<br>great liberality, thou shouldst avoid all those evil practices that are<br>called Vyasanas. It is not necessary that thou shouldst never indulge in<br>them. What, however, is needed is that thou shouldst not be attached to<br>them. He that is attached to those practices is prevailed over by<br>everyone. The king who cherishes no love for his people inspires the<br>latter with anxiety. The king should always bear himself towards his<br>subjects as a mother towards the child of her womb. Hear, O monarch, the<br>reason why this becomes desirable. As the mother, disregarding those<br>objects that are most cherished by her, seeks the good of her child<br>alone, even so, without doubt, should kings conduct themselves (towards<br>their subjects). The king that is righteous, O foremost one of Kuru's<br>race, should always behave in such a manner as to a\ old what is dear to<br>him, for the sake of doing that which would benefit his people. Thou<br>shouldst not ever, O son of Pandu, abandon fortitude. The king that is<br>possessed of fortitude and who is known to inflict chastisement on<br>wrong-doers, has no cause of fear. O foremost of speakers, thou shouldst<br>not indulge in jests with thy servants. O tiger among kings, listen to<br>the faults of such conduct. If the master mingles too freely with them,<br>dependents begin to disregard him. They forget their own position and<br>most truly transcend that of the master. Ordered to do a thing, they<br>hesitate, and divulge the master's secrets. They ask for things that<br>should not be asked for, and take the food that is intended for the<br>master. They go to the length of displaying their wrath and seek to<br>outshine the master. They even seek to predominate over the king, and<br>accepting bribes and practising deceit, obstruct the business of the<br>state. They cause the state to rot with abuses by falsifications and<br>forgeries. They make love with the female guards of the palace and dress<br>in the same style as their master. They become so shameless as to indulge<br>in eructations and the like, and expectorate in the very presence of<br>their master, O tiger among kings, and they do not fear to even speak of<br>him with levity before others. If the king becomes mild and disposed to<br>jest, his servants, disregarding him, ride on steeds and elephants and<br>cars as good as the king's.[162] His counsellors, assembled in court,<br>openly indulge in such speeches as: 'This is beyond thy power. This is a<br>wicked attempt.' If the king becomes angry, they laugh; nor are they<br>gladdened if favours be bestowed upon them, though they may express joy<br>for other reasons. They disclose the secret counsels of their master and<br>bruit his evil acts. Without the least anxiety they set at naught the<br>king's commands. If the king's jewels, or food, or the necessaries of his<br>bath, or unguents, be not forthcoming, the servants, in his very<br>presence, do not show the least anxiety. They do not take what rightfully<br>belongs to them. On the other hand, without being content with what has<br>been assigned to them, they appropriate what belongs to the king. They<br>wish to sport with the king as with a bird tied with a string, And always<br>give the people to understand that the king is very intimate with them<br>and loves them dearly. If the king becomes mild and disposed to jest, O<br>Yudhishthira, these and many other evils spring from it.'"
