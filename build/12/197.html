                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast said that as regards Reciters, they obtain<br>this very high end.[627] I beg to enquire whether this is their only end<br>or there is any other to which they attain.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen with concentrated attention, O puissant monarch,<br>to the end that silent Reciters attain, and to the diverse kinds of hell<br>into which they sink, O bull among men! That Reciter who does not at<br>first conduct himself according to the method that has been laid down,<br>and who cannot complete the ritual or course of discipline laid down, has<br>to go to hell.[628] That Reciter who goes on without faith, who is not<br>contented with his work, and who takes no pleasure in it, goes to hell,<br>without doubt. They who follow the ritual with pride in their hearts, all<br>go to hell. That Reciter who insults and disregards others has to go to<br>hell. That man who betakes himself to silent recitation under the<br>influence of stupefaction and from desire of fruit, obtains all those<br>things upon which his heart becomes set.[629] That Reciter whose heart<br>becomes set upon the attributes that go by the name of divinity, has to<br>incur hell and never becomes freed from it.[630] That Reciter who betakes<br>himself to recitation under the influence of attachments (to earthly<br>objects such as wealth, wives etc.) obtain those objects upon which their<br>hearts are set. That Reciter of wicked understanding and uncleansed soul<br>who sets himself to his work with an unstable mind, obtains an unstable<br>end or goes into hell. That Reciter who is not endued with wisdom and who<br>is foolish, becomes stupefied or deluded; and in consequence of such<br>delusion has to go to hell where he is obliged to indulge in<br>regrets.[631] If a person of even firm heart, resolving to complete the<br>discipline, betakes himself to recitation, but fails to attain to<br>completion in consequence of his having freed himself from attachments by<br>a violent stretch without genuine conviction of their inutility or<br>harmful character, he also has to go to hell[632].<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'When the Reciter attains to the essence of that<br>which exists in its own nature (without being anything like created or<br>born objects), which is Supreme, which is indescribable and<br>inconceivable, and which dwells in the syllable om forming the subject of<br>both recitation and meditation (indeed, when Reciters to a state of<br>Brahma), why is it that they have again to take birth in embodied forms?'<br><br>"Bhishma, said, 'In consequence of the absence of true knowledge and<br>wisdom, Reciters obtain diverse descriptions of hell. The discipline<br>followed by Reciters is certainly very superior. These, however, that I<br>have spoken of, are the faults that appertain to it.'"
