                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I am conversant with both the Vedas and the<br>scriptures that lead to the attainment of Brahma. In the Vedas there are<br>precepts of both kinds, viz., those that inculcate action and those that<br>inculcate renouncement of action. The scriptures are confounding and<br>their conclusions are based upon reasons. The truth, however, that is in<br>the Mantras, is duly known to me. Thou art conversant only with weapons<br>and observant of the practices of heroes. Thou art unable to understand<br>truly the sense of the scriptures. If thou wert really acquainted with<br>duty, then thou couldst have understood that words such as these ought<br>not to have been addressed to me by even one possessed of the clearest<br>insight into the meaning of the scriptures and acquainted with the truths<br>of religion. That, however, which thou hast said unto me, induced by<br>fraternal affection, has been fit and proper, O son of Kunti! I am, for<br>that, pleased with thee, O Arjuna! There is no one equal to thee in the<br>three worlds in all duties connected with battle and in skill in respect<br>of diverse kinds of acts. Thou mayst, therefore, speak of the subtleties<br>connected with those subjects,&#8212;subtleties, that is, that are<br>impenetrable by others. It behoveth thee not, however, O Dhananjaya, to<br>doubt my intelligence. Thou art conversant with the science of battle,<br>but thou hast never waited upon the aged. Thou knowest not the<br>conclusions arrived at by those that have studied the subject in brief<br>and detail. Even this is the conclusion of intelligent men whose<br>understanding are bent on achieving salvation, viz., that amongst ascetic<br>penances, renunciation, and knowledge of Brahma, the second is superior<br>to the first, and the third is superior to the second. This, however,<br>that thou thinkest, viz., that there is nothing superior to wealth, is an<br>error. I will convince thee of it, so that wealth may not again appear to<br>thee in that light. All men that are righteous are seen to be devoted to<br>ascetic penances and the study of the Vedas. The Rishis also, that have<br>many eternal regions for them, have the merit of penances. Others<br>possessed of tranquillity of soul, having no enemies, and dwelling in the<br>woods, have, through penances and study of the Vedas, proceeded to<br>heaven. Pious men, by restraining desire for worldly possessions, and<br>casting off that darkness which is born of folly, proceed northward<br>(i.e., by luminous paths) to the regions reserved for practisers of<br>renunciation. The path that lies to the south and that leads to regions<br>of light (i.e., lunar regions), are reserved for men devoted to action.<br>These are attained by persons subject to birth and death. That end,<br>however, which persons desirous of salvation have before their eyes, is<br>indescribable. Yoga is the best means for attaining to it. It is not easy<br>to explain it (to thee). Those that are learned live, reflecting on the<br>scriptures from desire of finding what is unreal. They are, however,<br>often led away to this and to that in the belief that the object of their<br>search exists in this and that. Having mastered, however, the Vedas, the<br>Aranyakas, and the other scriptures, they miss the real, like men failing<br>to find solid timber in an uprooted banana plant. Some there are who.,<br>disbelieving in its unity, regard the Soul, that dwells in this physical<br>frame consisting of the five elements, to be possessed of the attributes<br>of desire and aversion (and others).[62] Incapable of being seen by the<br>eye, exceedingly subtle, and inexpressible by words, it revolves in a<br>round (of re-births) among the creatures of the earth, keeping before it<br>that which is the root of action.[63] Having made the Soul advance<br>towards itself which is the spring of every kind of blessedness, having<br>restrained all desires of the mind, and having cast off all kinds of<br>action, one may become perfectly independent and happy. When there is<br>such a path that is trod by the righteous and that is attainable by<br>Knowledge, why, O Arjuna, dost thou applaud wealth which is full of every<br>kind of calamity? Men of olden times that were conversant with the<br>scriptures, O Bharata,&#8212;men that were always engaged in gifts and<br>sacrifice and action, were of this opinion. O Bharata! There are some<br>fools who, accomplished in the science of argumentation, deny the<br>existence of the Soul, in consequence of the strength of their<br>convictions of a previous life. It is very difficult to make them accept<br>this truth about final emancipation.[64] Those wicked men, though<br>possessed of great learning, travel all over the earth, making speeches<br>in assemblies, and deprecating the true doctrine about emancipation. O<br>Partha, who else will succeed in understanding that which we do not<br>understand?' Indeed, (as those men cannot understand the true meaning of<br>the scriptures), similarly they cannot succeed in knowing those wise and<br>pious persons that are truly great and that have deep acquaintance with<br>the scriptures. O son of Kunti, men acquainted with truth obtain Brahma<br>by asceticism and intelligence, and great happiness by renunciation.'
