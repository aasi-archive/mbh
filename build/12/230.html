                            "Yudhishthira said, 'What man is there who is dear to all, who gladdens<br>all persons, and who is endued with every merit and every accomplishment?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection I shall recite to thee the words that<br>Kesava, asked by Ugrasena, said unto him on a former occasion.'<br><br>"Ugrasena said, 'All persons seem to be very solicitous of speaking of<br>the merits of Narada. I think that celestial Rishi, must really be<br>possessed of every kind of merit. I ask thee, tell me this, O Kesava!'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'O chief of the Kukkuras, listen to me as I mention in<br>brief those good qualities of Narada with which I am acquainted, O king!<br>Narada is as learned in the scriptures as he is good and pious in his<br>conduct. And yet, on account of his conduct, he never cherishes pride<br>that makes one's blood so hot. It is for this reason that he is<br>worshipped everywhere. Discontent, wrath, levity, and fear, these do not<br>exist in Narada. He is free from procrastination, and possessed of<br>courage. For this he is worshipped everywhere. Narada deserves the<br>respectful worship of all. He never falls back from his words through<br>desire or cupidity. For this he is worshipped everywhere. He is fully<br>conversant with the principles that lead to the knowledge of the soul,<br>disposed to peace, possessed of great energy, and a master of his senses.<br>He is free from guile, and truthful in speech. For this he is worshipped<br>with respect everywhere. He is distinguished by energy, by fame, by<br>intelligence, by knowledge, by humility, by birth, by penances, and by<br>years. For these he is everywhere worshipped with respect. He is of good<br>behaviour. He dresses and houses himself well. He eats pure food. He<br>loves all. He is pure in body and mind. He is sweet-speeched. He is free<br>from envy and malice. For this he is everywhere worshipped with respect.<br>He is certainly always employed in doing good to all people. No sin<br>dwells in him. He never rejoices at other people's misfortunes. For this<br>he is everywhere worshipped with respect. He always seeks to conquer all<br>earthly desires by listening to Vedic recitations and attending to the<br>Puranas. He is a great renouncer and he never disregards any one.[869]<br>For this he is everywhere worshipped with respect. He casts an equal eye<br>on all; and, therefore, he has no one whom he loves and none whom he<br>hates. He always speaks what is agreeable to the hearer. For this he is<br>everywhere worshipped with respect. He is possessed of great learning in<br>the scriptures. His conversation is varied and delightful. His knowledge<br>and wisdom are great. He is free from cupidity. He is free also from<br>deception. He is large-hearted. He has, conquered wrath and cupidity. For<br>this he is everywhere worshipped with respect.

For this he is worshipped everywhere<br>with respect. He is unattached to all such things as are objects of<br>attachment (for others). For all that he seems to be attached to all<br>things.[870] He is never long subject to the influence of any doubt. For<br>this he is everywhere worshipped with respect. He has no yearning for<br>objects connected with profit and pleasure. He never glorifies his own<br>self. He is free from malice. He is mild in speech.

He never suffers his time to pass away<br>fruitlessly. His soul is under his control For this he is everywhere<br>worshipped with respect. He has toiled in subjects that deserve the<br>application of toil. He has earned knowledge and wisdom. He is never<br>satiated with yoga. He is always attentive and ready for exertion. He is<br>ever heedful. For this he is everywhere worshipped with respect. He has<br>never to feel shame for any deficiency of his. He is very attentive. He<br>is always engaged by others in accomplishing what is for their good. He<br>never divulges the secrets of others. For this he is everywhere<br>worshipped with respect.

Who,<br>indeed, is there that will not love him who is thus possessed of every<br>merit and accomplishment, who is clever in all things, who is pure in<br>body and mind, who is entirely auspicious, who is well-versed with the<br>course of time and its opportuneness for particular acts, and who is<br>well-acquainted with all agreeable things?'"
