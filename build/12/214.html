                            "Bhishma said, 'I shall now tell thee what the means are (for conquering<br>the senses) as seen with the eye of the scriptures. A person, O king,<br>will attain to the highest end by the help of such knowledge and by<br>framing his conduct accordingly. Amongst all living creatures man is said<br>to be the foremost.<br><br>Among men, those that are regenerate have been called the foremost; and<br>amongst the regenerate, they that are conversant with the Vedas. These<br>last are regarded as the souls of all living creatures. Indeed, those<br>Brahmanas that are conversant with the Vedas are regarded as all-seeing<br>and omniscient. They are persons who have become conversant with Brahma.<br>As a blind man, without a guide, encounters many difficulties on a road,<br>so has a person destitute of knowledge to encounter many obstacles in the<br>world. For this reason, those that are possessed of knowledge are<br>regarded as superior to the rest. Those that are desirous of acquiring<br>virtue practise diverse kinds of rites according to the dictates of the<br>scriptures. They do not, however, succeed in attaining to Emancipation,<br>all that they gain being those good qualities of which I shall presently<br>speak.[748] Purity of speech, of body, and of mind, forgiveness, truth,<br>steadiness, and intelligence,&#8212;these good qualities are displayed by<br>righteous persons observant of both kinds of religion. That which is<br>called Brahmacharya (religion of abstention or yoga) is regarded as the<br>means of attaining to Brahma. That is the foremost of all religions. It<br>is by the practice of that religion that one obtains the highest end<br>(viz., Emancipation). Brahmacharya is divested of all connection with the<br>five vital breaths, mind, understanding, the five senses of perception,<br>and the five senses of action. It is on that account free from all the<br>perceptions that the senses give. It is heard only as a word, and its<br>form, without being seen, can only be conceived. It is a state of<br>existence depending only on the mind. It is free from all connection with<br>the senses. That sinless state should be attained to by the understanding<br>alone. He that practises it duly attains to Brahma; he that practises it<br>half and half, attains to the condition of the gods; while he that<br>practises it indifferently, takes birth among Brahmanas and possessed of<br>learning attains to eminence. Brahmacharya is exceedingly difficult to<br>practise. Listen now to the means (by which one may practise it). That<br>regenerate person who betakes himself to it should subdue the quality of<br>Passion as soon as it begins to manifest itself or as soon as it begins<br>to be powerful. One that has betaken oneself to that vow should not speak<br>with women. He should never cast his eyes on an undressed woman. The<br>sight of women, under even indifferent circumstances, fills all<br>weak-minded men with Passion. If a person (while observing this vow)<br>feels a desire for woman rising in his heart, he should (as an expiation)<br>observe the vow called Krichcchra and also pass three days in water.[749]<br>If desire is entertained in course of a dream, one should, diving in<br>water, mentally repeat for three times the three Riks by<br>Aghamarshana.[750] That wise man who has betaken himself to the practice<br>of this vow should, with an extended and enlightened mind, burn the sins<br>in his mind which are all due to the quality of Passion. As the duct that<br>bears away the refuse of the body is very closely connected with the<br>body, even so the embodied Soul is very closely connected with the body<br>that confines it. The different kinds of juices, passing through the<br>network of arteries, nourish men's wind and bile and phlegm, blood and<br>skin and flesh, intestines and bones and marrow, and the whole body. Know<br>that there are ten principal ducts. These assist the functions of the<br>five senses. From those ten branch out thousands of other ducts that are<br>minuter in form. Like rivers filling the ocean at the proper season, all<br>these ducts, containing juices nourish the body. Leading to the heart<br>there is a duct called Manovaha. It draws from every part of the human<br>body the vital seed which is born of desire. Numerous other ducts<br>branching out from that principal one extend into every part of the body<br>and bearing the element of heat cause the sense of vision (and the rest).<br>As the butter that lies within milk is churned up by churning rods, even<br>so the desires that are generated in the mind (by the sight or thought of<br>women) draw together the vital seed that lies within the body. In the<br>midst of even our dreams passion having birth in imagination assails the<br>mind, with the result that the duct already named, viz., Manovaha, throws<br>out the vital seed born of desire. The great and divine Rishi Atri is<br>well-conversant with the subject of the generation of the vital seed. The<br>juices that are yielded by food, the duct called Manovaha, and the desire<br>that is born of imagination,&#8212;these three are the causes that originate<br>the vital seed which has Indra for its presiding deity. The passion that<br>aids in the emission of this fluid is, therefore, called Indriya. Those<br>persons who know that the course of vital seed is the cause of (that<br>sinful state of things called) intermixture of castes, are men of<br>restrained passions. Their sins are regarded to have been burnt off, and<br>they are never subjected to rebirth. He that betakes himself to action<br>simply for the purposes of sustaining his body, reducing with the aid of<br>the mind the (three) attributes (of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness) into<br>a state of uniformity, and brings at his last moments the vital breaths<br>to the duct called Manovaha, escapes the obligation of rebirth.[751] The<br>Mind is sure to gain Knowledge. It is the Mind that takes the form of all<br>things. The minds of all high-souled persons, attaining to success<br>through meditation, become freed from desire, eternal, and luminous.[752]<br>Therefore, for destroying the mind (as mind), one should do only sinless<br>deeds and freeing oneself from the attributes of Passion and Darkness,<br>one is sure to attain to an end that is very desirable.[753] Knowledge<br>(ordinarily) acquired in younger days becomes weakened with decrepitude.<br>A person, however, of ripe understanding succeeds, through the auspicious<br>effects of past lives, in destroying his desires.[754] Such a person, by<br>transcending the bonds of the body and the senses like a traveller<br>crossing a path full of obstacles, and transgressing all faults he sees,<br>succeeds in tasting the nectar (of Emancipation).'"
