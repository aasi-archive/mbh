                            "Bharadwaja said, 'When the high-souled Brahman has created thousands of<br>creatures, why is it that only these five elements which he created<br>first, which pervade all the universe and which are great creatures, have<br>come to have the name of creatures applied to them exclusively?'[554]<br><br>"Bhrigu said, 'All things that belong to the category of the Infinite or<br>the Vast receive the appellation of Great. It is for this reason that<br>these five elements have come to be called Great creatures. Activity is<br>wind. The sound that is heard is space. The heat that is within it is<br>fire. The liquid juices occurring in it are water. The solidified matter,<br>viz., flesh and bones, are earth. The bodies (of living creatures) are<br>thus made of the five (primeval) elements. All mobile and immobile<br>objects are made of these five elements. The five senses also of living<br>creatures partake of the five elements. The ear partakes of the<br>properties of space, the nose of earth; the tongue of water; touch of<br>wind; and the eyes of light (of fire).'<br><br>"Bharadwaja said, 'If all mobile and immobile objects be composed of<br>these five elements, why is it that in all immobile objects those<br>elements are not visible? Trees do not appear to have any heat. They do<br>not seem to have any motion. They are again made up of dense particles.<br>The five elements are not noticeable in them. Trees do not hear: they do<br>not see; they are not capable of the perceptions of scent or taste. They<br>have not also the perception of touch. How then can they be regarded as<br>composed of the five (primeval) elements? It seems to me that in<br>consequence of the absence of any liquid material in them, of any heat,<br>of any earth, of any wind, and of any empty space, trees cannot be<br>regarded as compounds of the five (primeval) elements.'<br><br>"Bhrigu said, 'Without doubt, though possessed of density, trees have<br>space within them. The putting forth of flowers and fruits is always<br>taking place in them. They have heat within them in consequence of which<br>leaf, bark, fruit, and flower, are seen to droop. They sicken and dry up.<br>That shows they have perception of touch. Through sound of wind and fire<br>and thunder, their fruits and flowers drop down. Sound is perceived<br>through the ear. Trees have, therefore, ears and do hear. A creeper winds<br>round a tree and goes about all its sides. A blind thing cannot find its<br>way. For this reason it is evident that trees have vision. Then again<br>trees recover vigour and put forth flowers in consequence of odours, good<br>and bad, of the sacred perfume of diverse kinds of dhupas. It is plain<br>that trees have scent.[555] They drink water by their roots. They catch<br>diseases of diverse kinds. Those diseases again are cured by different<br>operations. From this it is evident that trees have perceptions of taste.<br>As one can suck up water through a bent lotus-stalk, trees also, with the<br>aid of the wind, drink through their roots. They are susceptible of<br>pleasure and pain, and grow when cut or lopped off. From these<br>circumstances I see that trees have life. They are not inanimate. Fire<br>and wind cause the water thus sucked up to be digested. According, again,<br>to the quantity of the water taken up, the tree advances in growth and<br>becomes humid. In the bodies of all mobile things the five elements<br>occur. In each the proportions are different. It is in consequence of<br>these five elements that mobile objects can move their bodies. Skin,<br>flesh, bones, marrow, and arteries and veins, that exist together in the<br>body are made of earth. Energy, wrath, eyes, internal heat, and that<br>other heat which digest the food that is taken, these five, constitute<br>the fire that occurs in all embodied creatures.[556] The ears, nostrils,<br>mouth, heart, and stomach, these five, constitute the element of space<br>that occurs in the bodies of living creatures. Phlegm, bile, sweat, fat,<br>blood, are the five kinds of water that occur in mobile bodies. Through<br>the breath called Prana a living creature is enabled to move. Through<br>that called Vyana, they put forth strength for action. That called Apana<br>moves downwards. That called Samana resides within the heart. Through<br>that called Udana one eructates and is enabled to speak in consequence of<br>its piercing through (the lungs, the throat, and the mouth). These are<br>the five kinds of wind that cause an embodied creature to live and move.<br>The properties of scent an embodied creature knows through the<br>earth-element in him. From the water-element he perceives taste. From the<br>fire-element represented by the eyes, he perceives forms, and from the<br>wind-element he obtains the perception of touch. Scent, touch, taste,<br>vision, and sound, are regarded as the (general) properties of every<br>mobile and immobile object. I shall first speak of the several kinds of<br>scent. They are agreeable, disagreeable, sweet, pungent, far-going,<br>varied, dry, indifferent. All these nine kinds of scent are founded upon<br>the earth-element. Light is seen by the eyes and touch through the<br>wind-element. Sound, touch, vision and taste are the properties of water.<br>I shall speak (in detail) now of the perception of taste. Listen to me.<br>High-souled Rishis have spoken of diverse kinds of taste. They are sweet,<br>saltish, bitter, astringent, sour, and pungent. These are the six kinds<br>of taste appertaining to the water-element. Light contributes to the<br>vision of form. Form is of diverse kinds. Short, tall, thick,<br>four-cornered, round, white, black, red, blue, yellow, reddish, hard,<br>bright, smooth, oily, soft, and terrible. These are the sixteen different<br>kinds of form which constitute the property of light or vision. The<br>property of the wind-element is touch. Touch is of various kinds: warm,<br>cold, agreeable.. disagreeable, indifferent, burning, mild, soft, light,<br>and heavy. Both sound and touch are the two properties of the<br>wind-element. These are the eleven properties that appertain to the wind.<br>Space has only one property. It is called sound. I shall now tell thee<br>the different kinds of sound. They are the seven original notes called<br>Shadja, Rishabha, Gandhara, Mahdhyama, Panchama, Dhaivata and Nishada.<br>These are the seven kinds of the property that appertains to space. Sound<br>inheres like the Supreme Being in all space though attached especially to<br>drums and other instruments. Whatever sound is heard from drums small and<br>large, and conchs, and clouds, and cars, and animate and inanimate<br>creatures, are all included in these seven kinds of sound already<br>enumerated. Thus sound, which is the property of space, is of various<br>kinds. The learned have said sound to be born of space. When raised by<br>the different kinds of touch, which is the property of the wind, it may<br>be heard. It cannot however, be heard, when the different kinds of touch<br>are inceptive. The elements, mingling with their counterparts in the<br>body, increase and grow. Water, fire, wind are always awake in the bodies<br>of living creatures. They are the roots of the body. Pervading the five<br>life-breaths (already mentioned) they reside in the body.'"
