                            "Bhishma said, 'It is said that the preservation and growth of the<br>kingdom rest upon the king. The preservation and growth of the king rest<br>upon the king's priest. That kingdom enjoys true felicity where the<br>invisible fears of the subjects are dispelled by the Brahmana and all<br>visible fears are dispelled by the king with the might of his arms. In<br>this connection is cited the old narrative of the discourse between king<br>Muchukunda and Vaisravana. King Muchukunda, having subjugated the whole<br>earth, repaired to the lord of Alaka for testing his strength. King<br>Vaisravana created (by ascetic power) a large force of Rakshasas. These<br>ground the forces led by Muchukunda. Beholding the slaughter of his army,<br>king Muchukunda, O chastiser of foes, began to rebuke his own learned<br>priest (Vasishtha). Thereupon that foremost of righteous persons viz.,<br>Vasishtha, underwent very severe penances and, causing those Rakshasas to<br>be slain, ascertained the true course upon which Muchukunda was bent.<br>When king Vaisravana's troops were being slaughtered, he showed himself<br>unto Muchukunda and said these words.'<br><br>"The Lord of treasures said, 'Many kings of old, more powerful than thou<br>art, aided by their priests, had never approached me thus? All of them<br>were skilled in weapons and all of them were possessed of might.<br>Regarding me as the grantor of weal and woe, they approached me for<br>offering worship. In truth, if thou hast might of arms, it behoves thee<br>to display it. Why dost thou act so proudly, aided by Brahmana might?'<br>Enraged at these words, Muchukunda, without pride and fear, said unto the<br>lord of treasures these words fraught with reason and justice, 'The<br>self-born Brahman created the Brahmana and the Kshatriya. They have a<br>common origin. If they apply their forces separately, they would never be<br>able to uphold the world. The power of penances and mantras was bestowed<br>upon Brahmanas; the might of arms and of weapons was bestowed upon<br>Kshatriyas. Aggrandised by both kinds of might, kings should protect<br>their subjects. I am acting in that way. Why dost thou, O lord of Alaka,<br>rebuke me then?' Thus addressed, Vaisravana said unto Muchukunda and his<br>priest, 'I never, without being ordered by the (self-created) bestow<br>sovereignty upon any one. Nor do I ever, without being ordered, take it<br>away from any one. Know this, O king! Do thou rule then the whole earth<br>without bounds.' Thus addressed, king Muchukunda replied, saying, 'I do<br>not, O king, desire to enjoy sovereignty obtained as gift from thee! I<br>desire to enjoy sovereignty obtained by the might of my own arms.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'At these words of Muchukunda, Vaisravana, seeing the<br>king fearless in the observance of Kshatriya duties, became filled with<br>surprise. King Muchukunda, devoted to Kshatriya duties, continued to rule<br>the entire earth obtained by the might of his own arms. That virtuous<br>king who rules his kingdom, aided by and yielding precedence to the<br>Brahmana, succeeds in subjugating the whole earth and achieving great<br>fame. The Brahmana should every day perform his religious rites and the<br>Kshatriya should always be armed with weapons. Between them they are the<br>rightful owners of everything in the universe.'"
