                            "Narada said, 'Having thus obtained weapons from him of Bhrigu's race,<br>Karna began to pass his days in great joy, in the company of Duryodhana,<br>O bull of Bharata's race! Once on a time, O monarch, many kings repaired<br>to a self-choice at the capital of Chitrangada, the ruler of the country<br>of the Kalingas. The city, O Bharata, full of opulence, was known by the<br>name of Rajapura. Hundreds of rulers repaired thither for obtaining the<br>hand of the maiden. Hearing that diverse kings had assembled there,<br>Duryodhana. also, on his golden car, proceeded thither, accompanied by<br>Karna. When the festivities commenced in that self-choice, diverse<br>rulers, O best of kings, came thither for the hand of the maiden. There<br>were amongst them Sisupala and Jarasandha and Bhishmaka and Vakra, and<br>Kapotaroman and Nila and Rukmi of steady prowess, and Sringa who was<br>ruler of the kingdom females, and Asoka and Satadhanwan and the heroic<br>ruler of the Bhojas. Besides these, many others who dwelt in the<br>countries of the South, and many preceptors (in arms) of the mlechcha<br>tribes, and many rulers from the East and the North, O Bharata, came<br>there. All of them were adorned with golden Angadas, and possessed of the<br>splendour of pure gold. Of effulgent bodies, they were like tigers of<br>fierce might. After all those kings had taken their seats, O Bharata, the<br>maiden entered the arena, accompanied by her nurse and a guard of<br>eunuchs. Whilst being informed of the names of the kings (as she made her<br>round), that maiden of the fairest complexion passed by the son of<br>Dhritarashtra (as she had passed others before him). Duryodhana, however,<br>of Kuru's race, could not tolerate that rejection of himself.<br>Disregarding all the kings, he commanded the maiden to stop. Intoxicated<br>with the pride of energy, and relying upon Bhishma and Drona, king<br>Duryodhana, taking up that maiden on his car, abducted her with force.<br>Armed with sword, clad in mail, and his fingers cased in leathern fences,<br>Karna, that foremost of all wielders of weapons riding on his car,<br>proceeded along Duryodhana's rear. A great uproar then took place among<br>the kings, all of whom were actuated by the desire for fight, 'Put on<br>your coats of mail! Let the cars be made ready!' (These were the sounds<br>that were heard). Filled with wrath, they pursued Karna and Duryodhana,<br>showering their arrows upon them like masses of clouds pouring rain upon<br>a couple of hills. As they thus pursued them, Karna felled their bows and<br>arrows on the ground, each with a single arrow. Amongst them some became<br>bowless, some rushed bow in hand, some were on the point of shooting<br>their shafts, and some pursued them, armed with darts and maces.<br>Possessed of great lightness of hands, Karna, that foremost of all<br>smiters, afflicted them all. He deprived many kings of their drivers and<br>thus vanquished all those lords of earth. They then themselves took up<br>the reins of their steeds, and saying, 'Go away, go away', turned away<br>from the battle with cheerless hearts. Protected by Karna, Duryodhana<br>also came away, with a joyous heart, bringing with him the maiden to the<br>city called after the elephant.'"
