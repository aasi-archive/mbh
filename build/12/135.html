                            "Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old story of a robber who<br>having in this would been observant of restraints did not meet with<br>destruction in the next. There was a robber of the name of Kayavya, born<br>of a Kshatriya father and a Nishada mother. Kayavya was a practiser of<br>Kshatriya duties. Capable of smiting, possessed of intelligence and<br>courage, conversant with the scriptures, destitute of cruelty, devoted to<br>the Brahmanas, and worshipping his seniors and preceptors with reverence,<br>he protected the ascetics in the observance of their practices. Though a<br>robber, he still succeeded in winning felicity in heaven. Morning and<br>evening he used to excite the wrath of the deer by chasing them. He was<br>well conversant with all the practices of the Nishadas as also of all<br>animals living in the forest. Well acquainted with the requirements of<br>time and place, he roved over the mountains. Acquainted as he was with<br>the habits of all animals, his arrows never missed their aim, and his<br>weapons were strong. Alone, he could vanquish many hundreds of troops. He<br>worshipped his old, blind, and deaf parents in the forest every day. With<br>honey and flesh and fruits and roots and other kinds of excellent food,<br>he hospitably entertained all persons deserving of honour and did them<br>many good offices. He showed great respect for those Brahmanas that had<br>retired from the world for taking up their residence in the woods.<br>Killing the deer, he often took flesh to them. As regards those that were<br>unwilling, from fear of others, to accept gifts from him because of the<br>profession he followed, he used to go to their abodes before dawn and<br>leave flesh at their doors.[406] One day many thousands of robbers,<br>destitute of compassion in their conduct and regardless of all<br>restraints, desired to elect him as their leader.'<br><br>"The robbers said, 'Thou art acquainted with the requirements of place<br>and time. Thou hast wisdom and courage. Thy firmness also is great in<br>everything thou undertakest. Be thou our foremost of leaders, respected<br>by us all, We will do as thou wilt direct. Protect us duly, even as a<br>father or mother.'<br><br>"Kayavya said, 'Never kill ye a woman, or one that from fear keeps away<br>from the fight, or one that is a child, or one that is an ascetic. One<br>that abstains from fight should never be slain, nor should women be<br>seized or brought away with force. None of you should ever slay a woman<br>amongst all creatures. Let Brahmanas be always blessed and you should<br>always fight for their good. Truth should never be sacrificed. The<br>marriages of men should never be obstructed. No injury should be<br>inflicted on those houses in which the deities, the Pitris, and guests<br>are worshipped. Amongst creatures, Brahmanas deserve to be exempted by<br>you in your plundering excursions. By giving away even your all, you<br>should worship them. He who incurs the wrath of the Brahmanas, he for<br>whose discomfiture they wish, fails to find a rescuer in the three<br>worlds. He who speaks ill of the Brahmanas and wishes for their<br>destruction, himself meets with destruction like darkness at sunrise.<br>Residing here, ye shall acquire the fruits of your valour. Troops shall<br>be sent against those that will refuse to give us our dues. The rod of<br>chastisement is intended for the wicked. It is not intended for<br>self-aggrandisement. They who oppress the god deserve death, it is said.<br>They who seek to aggrandise their fortunes by afflicting kingdoms in<br>unscrupulous ways, very soon come to be regarded as vermin in a dead<br>body. Those robbers again that would conduct themselves by conforming to<br>these restraints of the scriptures, would soon win salvation although<br>leading a plundering life.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Those robbers, thus addressed, obeyed all the<br>commands of Kayavya. By desisting from sin, they obtained great<br>prosperity. By behaving himself in such a way by thus doing good to the<br>honest and by thus restraining the robbers from bad practices, Kayavya<br>won great success (in the next world). He who always thinks of this<br>narrative of Kayavya will not have any fear from the denizens of the<br>forest, in fact, from any earthly creature. Such a man will have no fear<br>from any creature, O Bharata! He will have no fear from wicked men. If<br>such a man goes to the forest, he will be able to live there with the<br>security of a king.'"
