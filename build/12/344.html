                            Saunaka said, "O Sauti, excellent is this narrative which thou hast<br>recited. Verily, these ascetics, having heard it have all been filled<br>with wonder. It is said, O Sauti, that a discourse that has Narayana for<br>its topic, is more fruitful of merit than sojourns unto all the sacred<br>retreats and ablutions performed in all the sacred waters on the Earth.<br>Having listened to this discourse of thine that has Narayana for its<br>topic, that is sacred and capable of cleansing one of every sin, all of<br>us have certainly become holy. Adored of all the worlds, that illustrious<br>and foremost of deities is incapable of being beheld by the deities with<br>Brahma numbering among them and all the Rishis. That Narada was able to<br>obtain a sight of the God Narayana, otherwise called Hari, was due, O son<br>of Suta, to the special grace of that divine and puissant Lord. When,<br>however, the celestial Rishi Narada had succeeded in obtaining a sight of<br>the Supreme Lord of the universe, a residing in the form of Aniruddha,<br>why did he again proceed so quickly (to the retreat of Vadari on the<br>breast of Himavat) for beholding those two foremost of godly of Rishis<br>viz., Nara and Narayana? Do you, O Sauti, tell us the reason of such<br>conduct on the part of Narada."<br><br>Sauti said, During the continuance of his snake-sacrifice, Janamejaya,<br>the royal son of Parikshit, availing himself of an interval in the<br>sacrificial rites, and when all the learned Brahmanas were resting. O<br>Saunaka, that king of kings, addressed the grandfather of his<br>grandfather, viz., the Island-born Krishna, otherwise called Vyasa, that<br>ocean of Vedic lore, that foremost of ascetics endued with puissance, and<br>said these words.<br><br>Janamejaya said, "After the celestial Rishi Narada had returned from<br>White Island, reflecting, as he came, on the words spoken to him by the<br>holy Narayana, what indeed, did the great ascetic next do? Arrived at the<br>retreat known by the name of Vadari on the breast of the Himvat<br>mountains, and seeing the two Rishis Nara and Narayana who were engaged<br>in severe austerities at that spot, how long did Narada dwell there and<br>what were the topics of conversation between him and the two Rishis? This<br>discourse on Narayana, that is really an ocean of knowledge, has been<br>raised by thy intelligent self by churning that vast history called<br>Bharata which consists of a hundred thousand verses. As butter is raised<br>from curds, sandal-wood from the mountains of Malaya, the Aranyakas from<br>the Vedas, and nectar from all the medicinal herbs, after the same<br>manner, O ocean of austerities, hath this discourse that is like nectar<br>and that has Narayana for its object, been raised by thee, O Brahmana,<br>from diverse histories and Puranas existing in the world, Narayana is the<br>Supreme Lord. Illustrious and endued with great puissance, He is the soul<br>of all creatures. Indeed, O foremost of regenerate ones, the energy of<br>Narayana is irresistible. Into Narayana, at the end of the Kalpa, enter<br>all the deities having Brahman for their foremost, all the Rishis with<br>the Gandharvas, and all things mobile and immobile. I think, therefore,<br>that there is nothing holier on earth or in heaven, and nothing higher,<br>than Narayana. A sojourn unto all the sacred retreats on Earth, and<br>ablutions performed in all the sacred waters, are not productive of as<br>much merit as a discourse that has Narayana for its topic. Having<br>listened from the beginning to this discourse on Hari, the lord of the<br>universe, that destroys all sins, we feel that we have been cleansed of<br>all our sins and sanctified entirely. Nothing wonderful was accomplished<br>by my ancestor Dhananjaya who was the victor in the great battle on<br>Kurukshetra, for it should be remembered that he had Vasudeva for his<br>ally. I think that, person could have nothing unattainable in the three<br>worlds, who had for his ally Vishnu himself, that great Lord of the<br>universe. Exceedingly fortunate and commendable were those ancestors of<br>mine, since they had Janarddana himself for looking after their temporal<br>and spiritual prosperity. Adored of all the worlds, the holy Narayana is<br>capable of being beheld with the aid of austerities alone. They, however,<br>succeeded in beholding Narayana, adorned with the beautiful whirl on his<br>chest. More fortunate than my ancestors was the celestial Rishi Narada,<br>the son of Pramesthi. Indeed, I thank that Narada, who transcends all<br>destruction, was endued with an energy that was not little, for repairing<br>to White-Island he had succeeded in beholding the person of Hari. Indeed,<br>it is evident that the sight he had obtained of the Supreme Lord was due<br>to only the grace of that Being. Fortunate was Narada inasmuch as he had<br>succeeded in beholding Narayana as existing in the form of Aniruddha.<br>Having beheld Narayana in that form, why did Narada hasten once more to<br>the retreat of Vadari for the purpose of beholding Nara and Narayana?<br>What was the reason, O ascetic, of this step taken by Narada? How long<br>also did Narada the son of Pramesthi, after his return from White Island<br>and arrival at Vadari and meeting with the two Rishis Nara and Narayana,<br>live there, and what conversations had he with them? What did those two<br>high-souled and foremost of Rishis say unto him? It behoveth thee to say<br>all this unto me!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana said,[1883] "Salutations unto the holy Vyasa of immeasurable<br>energy. Through his grace I shall recite this narrative having Narayana<br>for its topic. Arrived at White Island, Narada beheld the immutable Hari.<br>Leaving that spot he quickly proceeded, O king, to the mountains of Meru,<br>bearing in his mind those weighty words that Paramatma (the Supreme Lord)<br>had said unto him. Arrived at Meru he became filled with wonder at the<br>thought, O king, of what he had achieved. And he said unto himself, 'How<br>wonderful is it! The journey I have performed is a long one. Having<br>proceeded to such a distance, I have come back safe and sound. From the<br>mountains of Meru he then proceeded towards Gandhamadana. Traversing<br>through the skies he quickly alighted upon that extensive retreat known<br>by the name of Vadari. There he beheld those ancient deities, viz., those<br>two foremost of Rishis, (called Nara and Narayana), engaged in the<br>practice of penances, observing high vows, and devoted to the worship of<br>their own selves. Both of those adorable persons bore on their chests the<br>beautiful whirls called Sreevatsa, and both had matted locks on their<br>heads. And in consequence of the effulgence with which they illumined the<br>world they seemed to transcend the very Sun in energy. The palms of each<br>bore the mark called the swan's foot. The soles of their feet bore the<br>mark of the discus. Their chests were very broad; their arms reached down<br>to their knees. Each of them had four 'Mushkas'.[1884] Each of them had<br>sixty teeth and four arms.[1885] The voice of each was as deep as the<br>roar of the clouds. Their faces were exceedingly handsome, their<br>foreheads broad, their brows fair, their cheeks well-formed, and their<br>noses aquiline. The heads of those two deities were large and round,<br>resembling open umbrellas. Possessed of these marks, they were certainly<br>very superior persons in appearance. Beholding them, Narada became filled<br>with joy. He saluted them with reverence and was saluted by them in<br>return. They received the celestial Rishi, saying 'Welcome', and made the<br>ordinary enquiries. Beholding those two foremost of Beings, Narada began<br>to reflect within himself,&#8212;'These two foremost of Rishis seem to be very<br>like, in appearance, unto those Rishis respected by all, whom I have seen<br>in White-island. Thinking in this way, he circumambulated them both and<br>then sat down on the excellent seat made of Kusa grass that had been<br>offered unto him. After this, those two Rishis that were the abode of<br>penances, of famous achievements, and of energy,&#8212;and were endued with<br>tranquillity of heart and self-restraint, went through their morning<br>rites. They then, with controlled hearts, worshipped Narada with water to<br>wash his feet and the usual ingredients of the Arghya. Having finished<br>their morning rites and the observances necessary for receiving their<br>guest, they sat down on two seats made of wooden planks.[1886] When those<br>two Rishis took their seats, that place began to shine with peculiar<br>beauty even as the sacrificial altar shines with beauty in consequence of<br>the sacred fires when libations of clarified butter are poured upon them.<br>Then Narayana, seeing Narada refreshed from fatigue and seated at his<br>ease and well-pleased with the rites of hospitality he had received,<br>addressed him, saying these words.<br><br>"Nara and Narayana said, 'Hast thou seen in white Island the Paramatma<br>(Supreme Soul), who is eternal and divine, and who is the high source<br>whence we have sprung?'<br><br>"Narada said, 'I have seen that beautiful Being who is immutable and who<br>has the universe for his form. In Him dwell all the worlds, and all the<br>deities with the Rishis. Even now I behold that immutable Being, in<br>beholding you two. Those marks and indications that characterise Hari<br>himself of undisplayed form, characterise you two that are endued with<br>forms displayed before the senses.[1887] Verily, I behold both of you by<br>the side of that great God. Dismissed by the Supreme Soul, I have today<br>come hither. In energy and fame and beauty, who else in the three worlds<br>can equal Him than you two that have been born in the race of Dharma? He<br>has told me the entire course of duties having reference to Kshetrajna.<br>He has also told me of all those incarnations which he will, in the<br>future, have in this world. The inhabitants of White Island, whom I have<br>seen, are all divested of the five senses that are owned by ordinary<br>persons. All of them are of awakened souls, endued as they are with true<br>knowledge. They are, again, entirely devoted to the foremost of Beings,<br>viz., the Supreme Lord of the universe. They are always engaged in<br>worshipping that great Deity, and the latter always sports with them. The<br>holy and Supreme Soul is always fond of those that are devoted to him. He<br>is fond also of the regenerate ones. Always fond of those that are<br>devoted to Him, He sports with those worshippers of His. Enjoyer of the<br>universe, pervading everything, the illustrious Madhava is ever<br>affectionate towards his worshippers. He is the Actor; He is the Cause;<br>and He is the effect. He is endued with omnipotence and immeasurable<br>splendour. He is the Cause whence all things spring. He is the embodiment<br>of all the scriptural ordinances. He is the embodiment of all the topics.<br>He is possessed of great fame. Uniting Himself with penances, He has<br>illumined Himself with a splendour that is said to represent an energy<br>that is higher than (what occurs in) White Island. Of soul cleansed by<br>penances, He has ordained Peace and Tranquillity in the three worlds.<br>With such an auspicious understanding, he is engaged in the observance of<br>a very superior vow which is the embodiment of holiness. That realm where<br>he resides, engaged in tie austerest penances, the Sun does not warm and<br>the Moon does not shine. There the wind does not blow. Having constructed<br>an altar measuring eight fingers' breadth, the illustrious Creator of the<br>universe is practising penances there, standing on one foot, with arms<br>upraised, and with face directed towards the East, reciting the Vedas<br>with their branches, he is engaged in practising the severest<br>austerities. Whatever libations of clarified butter or meat are poured on<br>the sacrificial fire according to the ordinances of Brahma, by the<br>Rishis, by Pasupati himself, by the rest of the principal deities, by the<br>Daityas, the Danavas, and the Rakshasas, all reach the feet of that great<br>divinity. Whatever rites and religious acts are performed by persons<br>whose souls are entirely devoted to him, are all received by that great<br>Deity on his head. No one is dearer to him in the three worlds than those<br>persons that are awakened and possessed of high souls. Dearer even than<br>those persons is one that is entirely devoted to him. Dismissed by him<br>who is the Supreme Soul, I am coming here. This is what the illustrious<br>and holy Hari has himself said unto me. I shall henceforth reside with<br>you two, devoted to Narayana in the form of Aniruddha.'"
