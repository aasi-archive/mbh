                            "Yudhishthira said, 'By following what conduct, O thou that art<br>conversant with all courses of conduct, did Janaka, the ruler of Mithila<br>versed in the religion of Emancipation, succeed in attaining to<br>Emancipation, after casting off all worldly enjoyments?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the following old narrative<br>of the particular conduct by which that ruler, thoroughly conversant with<br>all courses of conduct, succeeded in achieving the highest felicity.<br>There was a ruler in Mithila of the name of Janadeva of Janaka's race. He<br>was ever engaged in reflecting upon the courses of conduct that might<br>lead to the attainment of Brahma. A century of preceptors always used to<br>live in his palace, lecturing him upon the diverse courses of duty<br>followed by people who had betaken themselves to diverse modes of<br>life.[793] Given to the study of the Vedas, he was not very well<br>satisfied with the speculations of his instructors on the character of<br>the Soul, and in their doctrines of extinction upon the dissolution of<br>the body or of rebirth after death. Once upon a time a great ascetic of<br>the name of Panchasikha, the son of Kapila, having roamed over the whole<br>world, arrived at Mithila. Endued with correct conclusions in respect of<br>all speculations about the diverse duties connected with renunciation, he<br>was above all pairs of opposites (such as heat and cold, happiness and<br>misery), and of doubts he had none. He was regarded as the foremost of<br>Rishis. Dwelling wherever he pleased, he desired to place before the<br>reach of all men eternal felicity that is so difficult of attainment. It<br>seemed that he went about, amazing the world, having assumed the form of<br>none else than that great Rishi, that lord of creatures, whom the<br>followers of the Sankhya doctrine knew by the name of Kapila. He was the<br>foremost of all the disciples of Asuri and was called the undying. He had<br>performed a mental Sacrifice that had lasted for thousand years.[794] He<br>was firm in mind, and had completed all the rites and sacrifices that are<br>enjoined in the scriptures and that lead to the attainment of Brahma. He<br>was fully conversant with the five sheaths that cover the soul.[795] He<br>was devoted to the five acts connected with the adoration of Brahma, and<br>had the five qualities (of tranquillity, self-restraint, etc.). Known (as<br>already said) by the name of Panchasikha, he had approached one day a<br>large concourse of Rishis following the Sankhya doctrines and enquired of<br>them about the highest object of human acquisition, viz., the Unmanifest<br>or that upon which the five Purushas or sheaths (already named)<br>rest.[796] For the sake of obtaining a knowledge of the Soul, Asuri had<br>enquired of his preceptor. In consequence of the latter's instructions<br>and of his own penances, Asuri understood the distinction between the<br>body and the Soul and had acquired celestial vision.[797] In that<br>concourse of ascetics, Asuri made his exposition of the Immutable One,<br>and Indestructible Brahma which is seen in diverse forms. Panchasikha<br>became a disciple of Asuri. He lived on human milk. There was a certain<br>Brahmani of the name of Kapila. She was the wife of Asuri.[798]<br>Panchasikha was accepted by her as a son and he used to suck her breasts.<br>In consequence of this, he came to be known as the son of Kapila and his<br>understanding became fixed on Brahma. All this, about the circumstances<br>of his birth and those that led to his becoming the son of Kapila, was<br>said unto me by the divine Rishi.[799] The latter also told me about the<br>omniscience of Panchasikha. Conversant with all courses of duty,<br>Panchasikha, after having himself acquired high knowledge, (came to<br>Janaka) and knowing that that king had equal reverence for all his<br>preceptors, began to amaze that century of preceptors (by an exposition<br>of his doctrine fraught), with abundant reasons. Observing the talent of<br>Kapileya, Janaka became exceedingly attached to him, and abandoning his<br>hundred preceptors, began to follow him in particular. Then Kapileya<br>began to discourse unto Janaka, who had according to the ordinance bent<br>his head unto him (as a disciple should) and who was fully competent to<br>apprehend the sage's instructions, upon that high religion of<br>Emancipation which is explained in Sankhya treatises. Setting forth in<br>the first place the sorrows of birth, he spoke next of the sorrows of<br>(religious) acts. Having finished that topic he explained the sorrows of<br>all states of life ending even with that in the high region of the<br>Creator.[800] He also discoursed upon that Delusion for whose sake is the<br>practice of religion, and acts, and their fruits, and which is highly<br>untrustworthy, destructible, unsteady, and uncertain.[801] Sceptics say<br>that when death (of the body) is seen and is a matter of direct evidence<br>witnessed by all, they who maintain, in consequence of their faith in the<br>scriptures, that something distinct from the body, called the Soul,<br>exists are necessarily vanquished in argument. They also urge that one's<br>death means the extinction of one's Soul, and that sorrow, decrepitude,<br>and disease imply (partial) death of the Soul. He that maintains, owing<br>to error, that the Soul is distinct from the body and exists after the<br>loss of body, cherishes an opinion that is unreasonable.[802] If that be<br>regarded as existent which does not really exist in the world, then it<br>may be mentioned that the king, being regarded so, is really never liable<br>to decrepitude or death. But is he, on that account, to be really<br>believed to be above decrepitude and death?[803] When the question is<br>whether an object exists or does not exist, and when that whose existence<br>is asserted presents all the indications of non-existence, what is that<br>upon which ordinary people rely in settling the affairs of life? Direct<br>evidence is the root of both inference and the scriptures. The scriptures<br>are capable of being contradicted by direct evidence. As to inference,<br>its evidentiary effect is not much. Whatever be the topic, cease to<br>reason on inference alone. There is nothing else called jiva than this<br>body. In a banian seed is contained the capacity to produce leaves and<br>flowers and fruits and roots and bark. From the grass and water that is<br>taken by a cow are produced milk and butter, substances whose nature is<br>different from that of the producing causes. Substances of different<br>kinds when allowed to decompose in water for some time produce spirituous<br>liquors whose nature is quite different from that of those substances<br>that produce them. After the same manner, from the vital seed is produced<br>the body and its attributes, with the understanding, consciousness, mind,<br>and other possessions. Two pieces of wood, rubbed together, produce fire.<br>The stone called Suryakanta, coming in contact with the rays of the Sun,<br>produces fire. Any solid metallic substance, heated in fire, dries up<br>water when coming in contact with it. Similarly, the material body<br>produces the mind and its attributes of perception, memory, imagination,<br>etc. As the loadstone moves iron, similarly, the senses are controlled by<br>the mind.[804] Thus reason the sceptics. The sceptics, however, are in<br>error. For the disappearance (of only the animating force) upon the body<br>becoming lifeless (and not the simultaneous extinction of the body upon<br>the occurrence of that event) is the proof (of the truth that the body is<br>not the Soul but that the Soul is something separate from the body and<br>outlives it certainly. If, indeed, body and Soul had been the same thing,<br>both would have disappeared at the same instant of time. Instead of this,<br>the dead body may be seen for some time _after_ the occurrence of death.<br>Death, therefore, means the flight from the body of something that is<br>different from the body). The supplication of the deities by the very men<br>who deny the separate existence of the Soul is another good argument for<br>the proposition that the Soul is separate from the body or has existence<br>that may be independent of a gross material case. The deities to whom<br>these men pray are incapable of being seen or touched. They are believed<br>to exist in subtile forms. (Really, if a belief in deities divested of<br>gross material forms does no violence to their reason, why should the<br>existence of an immaterial Soul alone do their reason such violence)?<br>Another argument against the sceptic is that his proposition implies a<br>destruction of acts (for if body and Soul die together, the acts also of<br>this life would perish,&#8212;a conclusion which no man can possibly come to<br>if he is to explain the inequalities or condition witnessed in the<br>universe).[805] These that have been mentioned, and that have material<br>forms, cannot possibly be the causes (of the immaterial Soul and its<br>immaterial accompaniments of perception, memory, and the like). The<br>identity of immaterial existences with objects that are material cannot<br>be comprehended. (Hence objects that are themselves material cannot by<br>any means be causes for the production of things immaterial).&#8212;Some are<br>of opinion that there is rebirth and that it is caused by Ignorance, the<br>desire for acts, cupidity, heedlessness, and adherence to other faults.<br>They say that Ignorance (Avidya) is the soul. Acts constitute the seed<br>that is placed in that soil. Desire is the water that causes that seed to<br>grow, in this way they explain rebirth. They maintain that that ignorance<br>being ingrained in an imperceptible way, one mortal body being destroyed,<br>another starts I up immediately from it; and that when it is burnt by the<br>aid of knowledge, the destruction of existence itself follows or the<br>person attains to what is called Nirvana. This opinion also is erroneous.<br>[This is the doctrine of Buddhists]. It may be asked that when the being<br>that is thus reborn is a different one in respect of its nature, birth,<br>and purposes connected with virtue and vice why should I then be regarded<br>to have any identity with the being that was? Indeed, the only inference<br>that can be drawn is that the entire chain of existences of a particular<br>being is not really a chain of connected links (but that existences in<br>succession are unconnected with one another).[806] Then, again if the<br>being that is the result of a rebirth be really different from what it<br>was in a previous phase of existence, it may be asked what satisfaction<br>can arise to a person from the exercise of the virtue of charity, or from<br>the acquisition of knowledge or of ascetic power, since the acts<br>performed by one are to concentrate upon another person in another phase<br>of existence (without the performer himself being existent to enjoy<br>them?) Another result of the doctrine under refutation would be that one<br>in this life may be rendered miserable by the acts of another in a<br>previous life, or having become miserable may again be rendered happy. By<br>seeing, however, what actually takes place in the world, a proper<br>conclusion may be drawn with respect to the unseen.[807] The separate<br>Consciousness that is the result of rebirth is (according to what may be<br>inferred from the Buddhistic theory of life) different from the<br>Consciousness that had preceded it in a previous life. The manner,<br>however, in which the rise or appearance of that separate Consciousness<br>is explained by that theory does not seem to be consistent or reasonable.<br>The Consciousness (as it existed in the previous life) was the very<br>reverse of eternal, being only transitory, extending as it did till<br>dissolution of the body. That which had an end cannot be taken as the<br>cause for the production of a second Consciousness appearing after the<br>occurrence of the end. If, again, the very loss of the previous<br>Consciousness be regarded as the cause of the production of the second<br>Consciousness, then upon the death of a human body being brought about by<br>a heavy bludgeon, a second body would arise from the body that is thus<br>deprived of animation.[808] Once more, their doctrine of extinction of<br>life (or Nirvana or Sattwasankshaya) is exposed to the objection that<br>that extinction will become a recurring phenomenon like that of the<br>seasons, or the year, or the yuga, or heat, or cold, or objects that are<br>agreeable or disagreeable.[809] If for the purpose of avoiding these<br>objections, the followers of this doctrine assert the existence of a Soul<br>that is permanent and unto which each new Consciousness attaches, they<br>expose themselves to the new objection that that permanent substance, by<br>being overcome with decrepitude, and with death that brings about<br>destruction, may in time be itself weakened and destroyed. If the<br>supports of a mansion are weakened by time, the mansion itself is sure to<br>fall down at last.[810] The senses, the mind, wind, blood, flesh, bones<br>(and all the constituents of the body), one after another, meet with<br>destruction and enter each into its own productive cause.[811] If again<br>the existence of an eternal Soul be asserted that is immutable, that is<br>the refuge of the understanding, consciousness, and other attributes of<br>the usual kind, and that is dissociated from all these, such an assertion<br>would be exposed to a serious objection, for then all that is usually<br>done in the world would be unmeaning, especially with reference to the<br>attainment of the fruits of the charity and other religious acts. All the<br>declarations in the Srutis inciting to those acts, and all acts connected<br>with the conduct of men in the world, would be equally unmeaning, for the<br>Soul being dissociated from the understanding and the mind, there is no<br>one to enjoy the fruits of good acts and Vedic rites.[812] Thus diverse<br>kinds of speculations arise in the mind. Whether this opinion is right or<br>that is right, there is no means of settling. Engaged in reflecting on<br>those opinions, particular persons follow particular lines of<br>speculation. The understandings of these, directed to particular<br>theories, become wholly taken up with them and are at last entirely lost<br>in them. Thus all men are rendered miserable by pursuits, good or bad.<br>The Vedas along, bringing them back to the right path, guide them along<br>it, like grooms conducting their elephants.[813] Many men, with weakened<br>minds, covet objects that are fraught with great happiness. These,<br>however, have soon to meet with a much larger measure of sorrow, and<br>then, forcibly torn from their coveted meat, they have to own the sway of<br>death. What use has one, who is destined to destruction and whose life is<br>unstable, with kinsmen and friends and wives and other possessions of<br>this kind? He who encounters death after having cast off all these,<br>passes easily out of the world and has never to return. Earth, space,<br>water, heat and wind, always support and nourish the body. Reflecting<br>upon this, how can one feel any affection for one's body? Indeed, the<br>body, which is subject to destruction, has no joy in it. Having heard<br>these words of Panchasikha that were free from deception, unconnected<br>with delusion (because discouraging sacrifices and other Vedic acts),<br>highly salutary, and treating of the Soul, king Janadeva became filled<br>with wonder, and prepared himself to address the Rishi once more.'"
