                            "Parasara said, 'Nobody in this world does good to another. Nobody is<br>seen to make gifts to others. All persons are seen to act for their own<br>selves. People are seen to cast off their very parents and their uterine<br>brothers when these cease to be affectionate. What need be said then or<br>relatives of other degrees?[1517] Gifts to a distinguished person and<br>acceptance of the gifts made by a distinguished person both lead to equal<br>merit. Of these two acts, however, the making of a gift is superior to<br>the acceptance of a gift.[1518] That wealth which is acquired by proper<br>means and increased also by proper means, should be protected with care<br>for the sake of acquiring virtue. This is an accepted truth. One desirous<br>of acquiring righteousness should never earn wealth by means involving<br>injury to others. One should accomplish one's acts according to one's<br>power, without zealously pursuing wealth. By giving water, whether cold<br>or heated by fire, with a devoted mind, unto a (thirsty) guest, according<br>to the best of one's power, one earns the merit that attaches to the act<br>of giving food to a hungry man. The high-souled Rantideva obtained<br>success in all the worlds by worshipping the ascetics with offerings of<br>only roots and fruits leaves. The royal son of Sivi also won the highest<br>regions of felicity by having gratified Surya along with his companion<br>with offerings of the same kind. All men, by taking birth, incur debts to<br>gods, guests, servants, Pitris, and their own selves. Everyone should,<br>therefore, do his best for freeing himself from those debts. One frees<br>oneself from one's debt to the great Rishis by studying the Vedas. One<br>pays off one's debts to the gods by performing sacrifices. By performing<br>the rites of the Sraddha one is freed from one's debts to the Pitris. One<br>pays off one's debt to one's fellowmen by doing good offices to them. One<br>pays off the debts one owes to one's own self by listening to Vedic<br>recitations and reflecting on their import, by eating the remnants of<br>sacrifices, and by supporting one's body. One should duty discharge all<br>the acts, from the beginning, that one owes to one's servants. Though<br>destitute of wealth, men are seen to attain to success by great<br>exertions.[1519] Munis by duly adoring the deities and by duty pouring<br>libations of clarified butter on the sacred fire, have been seen to<br>attain to ascetic success. Richika's son became the son of Vishwamitra.<br>By adoring the deities who have shares in sacrificial offerings, with<br>Richs (he attained to success in after life). Usanas became Sukra by<br>having gratified the god of gods. Indeed., by hymning the praises of the<br>goddess (Uma), he sports in the firmament, endued with great<br>splendour.[1520] Then, again, Asita and Devala, and Narada and Parvata,<br>and Karkshivat, and Jamadagni's son Rama, and Tandya possessed of<br>cleansed soul, and Vasishtha, and Jamadagni, and Viswamitra and Atri, and<br>Bharadwaja, and Harismasru, and Kundadhara, and Srutasravas,&#8212;these great<br>Rishis, by adoring Vishnu with concentrated minds with the aid of Richs,<br>and by penances, succeeded in attaining to success through the grace of<br>that great deity endued with intelligence. Many undeserving men, by<br>adoring that good deity, obtained great distinction. One should not seek<br>for advancement by achieving any wicked or censurable act. That wealth<br>which is earned by righteous ways is true wealth. Fie on that wealth,<br>however, which is earned by unrighteous means. Righteousness is eternal.<br>It should never, in this world, be abandoned from desire of wealth. That<br>righteous-souled person who keeps his sacred fire and offers his daily<br>adorations to the deities is regarded as the foremost of righteous<br>persons. All the Vedas, O foremost of kings, are established on the three<br>sacred fires (called Dakshina, Garhapatya, and Ahavaniya). That Brahmana<br>is said to possess the sacred fire whose acts exist in their entirety. It<br>is better to at once abandon the sacred fire than to keep it, abstaining<br>the while from acts. The sacred fire, the mother, the father who has<br>begotten, and the preceptor, O tiger among men, should all be duly waited<br>upon and served with humility. That man who, casting off all feelings of<br>pride, humbly waits upon and serves them that are venerable for age, who<br>is possessed of learning and destitute of lust, who looketh upon all<br>creatures with an eye of love, who has no wealth, who is righteous in his<br>acts, and who is destitute of the desire of inflicting any kind of harm<br>(upon any one), that truly respectable man is worshipped in this world by<br>those that are good and pious.'"[1521]
