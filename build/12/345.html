                            "Nara and Narayana said, 'Deserving art thou of the highest praise, and<br>highly favoured hast thou been, since thou hast beheld the puissant<br>Narayana himself (in the form of Aniruddha). None else, not even Brahma<br>himself who was sprung from the primal lotus, has been able to behold<br>him. That foremost of Purushas, endued with puissance and holiness, is of<br>unmanifest origin and incapable of being seen. These words that we say<br>unto thee are very true, O Narada. There exists no one in the universe<br>that is dearer to him than one that adores him with devotion. It is for<br>this, O best of regenerate ones, that he showed himself unto thee. No one<br>can repair to that realm where the Supreme Soul is engaged in the<br>observance of penances, except we two, O foremost of regenerate persons.<br>In consequence of that spot being adorned by Him, its splendour resembles<br>the effulgence of a thousands Suns collected together.[1888] From that<br>illustrious Being, O Brahmana, from Him who is the origin of the Creator<br>of the universe, O foremost of all persons endued with forgiveness,<br>springs the attribute of forgiveness which attaches to the Earth.[1889]<br>It is from that illustrious Being who seek the welfare of all beings,<br>that Rasa (Taste) hath arisen. The attribute of Rasa attaches to the<br>waters which are, again, liquid. It is from Him that Heat or Light having<br>the attribute of form or vision has arisen. It attaches itself to the sun<br>in consequence of which the Sun becomes able to shine and give heat. It<br>is from that illustrious and foremost of Beings that Touch also has<br>arisen. It is attached to the Wind, in consequence of which the Wind<br>moves about in the world producing the sensation of touch. It is from<br>that puissant Lord of the entire universe that Sound has arisen. It<br>attaches to Space, which, in consequence thereof, exists uncovered and<br>unconfined. It is from that illustrious Being that Mind, which pervades<br>all Beings, has arisen. It attaches to Chandramas, in consequence of<br>which Chandramas comes to be invested with the attribute of displaying<br>all the things. That spot where the divine Narayana, that partaker of the<br>libations and other offerings made in sacrifices, resides with Knowledge<br>alone for his companion, has in the Vedas, been called by the name of the<br>productive cause of all things or Sat.[1890] The path that is theirs, O<br>foremost of regenerate persons, that are stainless and that are freed<br>from both virtue and sin, is fraught with auspiciousness and felicity.<br>Aditya, who is the dispeller of the darkness of all the worlds, is said<br>to be the door (through which the Emancipate must pass). Entering Aditya,<br>the bodies of such persons become consumed by his fire. They then become<br>invisible for after that they cannot be seen by anybody at any time.<br>Reduced into invisible atoms, they then enter (Narayana in manifested<br>form and residing in the middle of the region covered by Aditya) into the<br>form of Aniruddha. Losing all physical attributes and being altogether<br>and transformed into Mind alone, they then enter into Pradyumna. Passing<br>out of Pradyumna, those foremost of regenerate persons, including both<br>those that are conversant with Sankhya philosophy and those that are<br>devoted to the Supreme deity, then enter Sankarsana who is otherwise<br>called Jiva. After this, divested of the three primal attributes of<br>Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas, those foremost of regenerate beings quickly<br>enter the Paramatma (Supreme Soul) otherwise called Kshetrajna and which<br>itself transcends the three primal attributes. Know that Vasudeva is He<br>when called Kshetrajna. Verily shouldst thou know that, that Vasudeva is<br>the abode or original refuge of all things in the universe. Only they<br>whose minds are concentrated, who are observant of all kinds of<br>restraint, whose senses are controlled, and who are devoted to One,<br>succeed in entering Vasudeva. We two, O foremost of regenerate ones, have<br>taken birth in the house of Dharma. Residing in this delightful and<br>spacious retreat we are undergoing the austerest penances. We are thus<br>engaged, O regenerate one, being moved by the desire of benefiting those<br>manifestations of the Supreme Deity, dear to all the celestials, that<br>will occur in the three worlds (for achieving diverse feats that are<br>incapable of being achieved by any other Being). In accordance with such<br>ordinances as are uncommon and as apply to us two only, O best of<br>regenerate persons, we are duly observing all excellent and high vows<br>fraught with the austerest penances. Thou, O celestial Rishi, endued with<br>wealth of penances wert beheld by us in White Island when thou wert<br>there. Having met with Narayana, thou hast made a particular resolution,<br>which is known to us. In the three worlds consisting of mobile and<br>immobile Beings, there is nothing that is unknown to us. Of good or evil<br>that will occur or has occurred or is occurring, that God of gods, O<br>great ascetic, has informed thee!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having heard these words of Nara and Narayana<br>both of whom were engaged in the practice of the austerest penances, the<br>celestial Rishi Narada joined his hands in reverence and became entirely<br>devoted to Narayana. He employed his time in mentally reciting, with due<br>observances, innumerable sacred Mantras that are approved by Narayana.<br>Worshipping the Supreme Deity Narayana, and adoring those two ancient<br>Rishis also that had taken birth in the house of Dharma, the illustrious<br>Rishi Narada, endued with great energy, continued to reside, thus<br>employed, in that retreat, called Vadari, on the breast of Himavat,<br>belonging to Nara and Narayana, for a thousand years as measured by the<br>standard of the celestials.'"
