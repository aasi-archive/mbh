                            "Yudhishthira said, 'What acts should be done by a king, and what are<br>those acts by doing which a king may become happy? Tell me this in<br>detail, O thou that art the foremost of all persons acquainted with<br>duties.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall tell thee what thou wishest to know. Listen to<br>the settled truth about what should be done in this world by a king and<br>what those acts are by doing which a king may become happy. A king should<br>not behave after the manner disclosed in the high history of a camel of<br>which we have heard. Listen to that history then, O Yudhishthira! There<br>was, in the Krita age, a huge camel who had recollection of all the acts<br>of his former life. Observing the most rigid vows, that camel practised<br>very severe austerities in the forest. Towards the conclusion of his<br>penances, the puissant Brahman became gratified with him. The Grandsire,<br>therefore, desired to grant him boons.'<br><br>"The camel said, 'Let my neck, O holy one, become long through thy grace,<br>so that, O puissant lord, I may be able to seize any food that may lie<br>even at the end of even a hundred Yojanas.' The high-souled giver of<br>boons said, 'Let it be so.' The camel then, having obtained the boon,<br>returned to his own forest. The foolish animal, from the day of obtaining<br>the boon, became idle. Indeed, the wretch, stupefied by fate, did not<br>from that day go out for grazing. One day, while extending his long neck<br>of a hundred Yojanas, the animal was engaged in picking his food without<br>any labour, a great storm arose. The camel, placing his head and a<br>portion of the neck within the cave of a mountain, resolved to wait till<br>the storm would be over. Meanwhile it began to pour in torrents, deluging<br>the whole earth. A jackal, with his wife, drenched by the rain and<br>shivering with cold, dragged himself with difficulty towards that very<br>cave and entered it quickly for shelter. Living as he did upon meat, and<br>exceedingly hungry and tired as he was, O bull of Bharata's race, the<br>jackal, seeing the camel's neck, began to eat as much of it as he could.<br>The camel, when he perceived that his neck was being eaten, strove in<br>sorrow to shorten it. But as he moved it up and down, the jackal and his<br>wife, without losing their hold of it, continued to eat it away. Within a<br>short time the camel was deprived of life. The jackal then, having (thus)<br>slain and eaten the camel, came out of the cave after the storm and<br>shower had ceased. Thus did that foolish camel meet with his death.<br>Behold, what a great evil followed in the train of idleness. As regards<br>thyself, avoiding idleness and restraining thy senses, do everything in<br>the world with proper means. Manu himself has said that victory depends<br>upon intelligence. All acts that are accomplished with the aid of<br>intelligence are regarded as the foremost, those achieved with the aid of<br>arms are middling, those achieved with the aid of feet are inferior,<br>while those done by carrying loads are the lowest. If the king is clever<br>in the transaction of business and restrains his senses, his kingdom<br>endures. Manu himself has said that it is with the aid of the<br>intelligence that an ambitious person succeeds in achieving victories. In<br>this world, O Yudhishthira, they who listen to wise counsels that are not<br>generally known, that are, O sinless one, possessed of allies, and that<br>act after proper scrutiny, succeed in achieving all their objects. A<br>person possessed of such aids succeeds in ruling the entire earth. O thou<br>that art possessed of prowess like that of Indra himself, this has been<br>said by wise men of ancient times conversant with the ordinances laid<br>down in the scriptures. I, also, with sight directed to the scriptures,<br>have said the same to thee. Exercising thy intelligence, do thou act in<br>this world, O king!'"
