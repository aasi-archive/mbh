                            "Yudhishthira said, 'For a little while, O Arjuna, concentrate thy<br>attention and fix thy mind and hearing on thy inner soul. If thou<br>listenest to my words in such a frame of mind, they will meet with thy<br>approbation. Abandoning all worldly pleasures, I shall betake myself to<br>that path which is trod by the righteous. I shall not, for thy sake,<br>tread along the path thou recommendest. If thou askest me what path is<br>auspicious that one should tread alone, I shall tell thee. If thou dost<br>not desire to ask me, I shall yet, unasked by thee, tell thee of it.<br>Abandoning the pleasures and observance of men of the world, engaged in<br>performing the austerest of penances, I shall wander in the forest, with<br>the animals that have their home there, living on fruit and roots.<br>Pouring libations on the: fire at due hours, and performing ablutions at<br>morn and eve, I shall thin myself by reduced diet, and covering myself<br>with skins, bear matted locks on my head. Enduring cold, wind, and heat<br>as also hunger and thirst and toil, I shall emaciate my body by penances<br>as laid down in the ordinance. Charming to the heart and the ear, I shall<br>daily listen to the clear strains of, cheerful birds and animals residing<br>in the woods. I shall enjoy the fragrance of flower-burthened trees and<br>creepers, and see diverse kinds of charming products that grow in the<br>forest. I shall also see many excellent recluses of the forest. I shall<br>not do the slightest injury to any creature, what need be said then of<br>those that dwell in villages and towns?[10] Leading a retired life and<br>devoting myself to contemplation, I shall live upon ripe and unripe<br>fruits and gratify the Pitris and the deities with offerings of wild<br>fruits and spring water and grateful hymns. Observing in this way the<br>austere regulations of a forest life, I shall pass my days, calmly<br>awaiting the dissolution of my body. Or, living alone and observing the<br>vow of taciturnity, with my head shaved clean, I shall derive my<br>sustenance by begging each day of only one tree.[11] Smearing my body<br>with ashes, and availing of the shelter of abandoned houses, or lying at<br>the foot of trees, I shall live, casting off all things dear or hateful.<br>Without indulging in grief or joy, and regarding censure and applause,<br>hope and affliction, equally, and prevailing over every couple of<br>opposites, I shall live casting off all the things of the world. Without<br>conversing with anybody, I shall assume the outward form of a blind and<br>deaf idiot, while living in contentment and deriving happiness from my<br>own soul. Without doing the least injury to the four kinds of movable and<br>immovable creatures, I shall behave equally towards all creatures whether<br>mindful of their duties or following only the dictates of the senses. I<br>shall not jeer at any one, nor shall I frown at anybody. Restraining all<br>my senses, I shall always be of a cheerful face. Without asking anybody<br>about the way, proceeding along any route that I may happen to meet with,<br>I shall go on, without taking note of the country or the point of the<br>compass to which or towards which I may go. Regardless of whither I may<br>proceed, I shall not look behind. Divesting myself of desire and wrath,<br>and turning my gaze inwards, I shall go on, casting off pride of soul and<br>body. Nature always walks ahead; hence, food and drink will somehow be<br>accomplished. I shall not think of those pairs of opposites that stand in<br>the way of such a life. If pure food in even a small measure be not<br>obtainable in the first house (to which I may go), I shalt get it by<br>going to other houses. If I fail to procure it by even such a round, I<br>shall proceed to seven houses in succession and fill my craving. When the<br>smoke of houses will cease, their hearth-fires having been extinguished,<br>when husking-rods will be kept aside, and all the inmates will have taken<br>their food, when mendicants and guests Will cease to wander, I shall<br>select a moment for my round of mendicancy and solicit alms at two,<br>three, or five houses at the most. I shall wander over the earth, after<br>breaking the bonds of desire. Preserving equability in success and<br>failure, I shall earn great ascetic merit. I shall behave neither like<br>one that is fond of life nor like one that is about to die. I shall not<br>manifest any liking for life or dislike for death. If one strikes off one<br>arm of mine and another smears the other arm with sandal-paste, I shall<br>not wish evil to the one or good to the other. Discarding all those acts<br>conducive to prosperity that one can do in life, the only acts I shall<br>perform will be to open and shut my eyes and take as much food and drink<br>as will barely keep up life. Without ever being attached to action, and<br>always restraining the functions of the senses, I shall give up all<br>desires and purify the soul of all impurities. Freed from all attachments<br>and tearing off all bonds and ties, I shall live free as the wind. Living<br>in such freedom from affections, everlasting contentment will be mine.<br>Through desire, I have, from ignorance, committed great sins. A certain<br>class of men, doing both auspicious and inauspicious acts here, maintain<br>their wives, children, and kinsmen, all bound to them in relations of<br>cause and effect.[12] When the period of their life runs out, casting off<br>their weakened bodies, they take upon themselves all the effects of their<br>sinful acts, for none but the actor is burdened with the consequences of<br>his acts.[13] Even thus, endued with actions, creatures come into this<br>wheel of life that is continually turning like the wheel of a car, and<br>even thus, coming thither, they meet with their fellow-creatures. He,<br>however, who abandons the worldly course of life, which is really a<br>fleeting illusion although it looks eternal, and which is afflicted by<br>birth, death, decrepitude, disease, and pain, is sure to obtain<br>happiness. When again, the very gods fall down from heaven and great<br>Rishis from their respective positions of eminence who, that is<br>acquainted with truths of causes (and effects) would wish to have even<br>heavenly prosperity?[14] Insignificant kings, having performed diverse<br>acts relating to the diverse means of kingcraft (known by the means of<br>conciliation, gift, &c.) often slay a king through some contrivance.<br>Reflecting on these circumstances, this nectar of wisdom hath come to me.<br>Having attained it, I desire to get a permanent, eternal, and<br>unchangeable place (for myself). Always (conducting myself) with such<br>wisdom and acting in this way, I shall, by betaking myself to that<br>fearless path of life, terminate this physical frame that is subject to<br>birth, death, decrepitude, disease, and pain.'"
