                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing these words of Krishna fraught with Morality<br>and profit, Santanu's Bhishma, answered him in the following words.<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O master of all the worlds, O mighty-armed one, O Siva, O<br>Narayana, O thou of unfading glory, hearing the words spoken by thee I<br>have been filled with joy. But what words (of instruction), O master of<br>speech, can I say in thy presence, when especially in all the subjects of<br>speech have been dealt with in the speech?[157] Whatever in either world<br>should be done or is done, proceeds from thy intelligent self, O god!<br>That person who is competent to discourse on the subject of heaven in the<br>presence of the chief of the gods himself is competent to discourse on<br>the interpretation of morality and pleasure and profit and salvation in<br>thy presence. My mind, O slayer of Madhu, is exceedingly agitated by the<br>pain of arrow-wounds. My limbs are weak. My understanding is not clear. I<br>am so afflicted, O Govinda, by these shafts resembling poison or fire<br>that I have not power to utter anything. My strength is abandoning me. My<br>life-breaths are hastening to leave me. The very vitals of my body are<br>burning. My understanding is clouded. From weakness my utterance is<br>becoming indistinct. How then can I venture to speak? O enhancer of (the<br>glory of) Dasarha's race, be gratified with me. O mighty-armed one, I<br>will not say anything. Pardon me (for my unwillingness). The very master<br>of speech (Vrihaspati), in speaking in thy presence, will be overcome by<br>hesitation. I cannot any longer distinguish the points of the compass,<br>nor the sky from the earth! Through thy energy, O slayer of Madhu, I am<br>only barely alive. Do thou, therefore, thyself speak for the good of king<br>Yudhishthira the just, for thou art the ordainer of all the ordinances.<br>How, O Krishna, when thou, the eternal creator of the universe, art<br>present, can one like me speak (on such subjects) like a disciple in the<br>presence of the preceptor?'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'The words spoken by thee are worthy of thee that art the<br>foremost one of Kuru's race, thee that art endued with great energy, thee<br>that art of great soul, and thee that art possessed of great patience and<br>conversant with every subject. Regarding what hast thou said unto me<br>about the pain of thy arrow-wounds, receive, O Bhishma, this boon that I<br>grant thee, O puissant one, from my grace. Discomfort and stupefaction<br>and burning and pain and hunger and thirst shall not, O son of Ganga,<br>overcome thee, O thou of unfading glory! Thy perceptions and memory, O<br>sinless one, shall be unclouded.[158] The understanding shall not fail<br>thee. The mind, O Bhishma, freed from the qualities of passion and<br>darkness, will always be subject to the quality of goodness, like the<br>moon emerged from the clouds. Thy understanding will penetrate whatever<br>subject connected with duty, morality, or profit, thou wilt think upon. O<br>tiger among kings, obtaining celestial vision, thou wilt, O thou of<br>immeasurable prowess, succeed in beholding the four orders of created<br>things. Endued with the eye of knowledge, thou wilt, O Bhishma, behold,<br>like fishes in a limpid stream, all created things that thou mayst<br>endeavour to recollect!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then those great Rishis, with Vyasa amongst<br>them, adored Krishna with hymns from the Richs, the Yajuses, and the<br>Samans. A celestial shower of flowers belonging to every season fell on<br>that spot where he of Vrishni's race, with Ganga's son and the son of<br>Pandu were. Celestial instruments of every kind played in the welkin and<br>the tribes of Apsaras began to sing. Nothing of evil and no portent of<br>any evil kind were seen there. An auspicious, pleasant, and pure breeze,<br>bearing every kind of fragrance, began to blow. All the points of the<br>compass became clear and quiet, and all the animals and birds began to<br>rove in peace. Soon after, like a fire at the extremity of a great<br>forest, the divine Surya of a thousand rays was seen to descend to the<br>west. The great Rishis then, rising up, saluted Janardana and Bhishma and<br>king Yudhishthira. Upon this, Kesava, and the sons of Pandu, and Satyaki,<br>and Sanjaya, and Saradwata's son Kripa, bowed in reverence to those<br>sages. Devoted to the practice of righteousness, those sages, thus<br>worshipped by Kesava and others, speedily proceeded to their respective<br>abodes, saying, 'We will return tomorrow.' After this, Kesava and the<br>Pandavas, saluting Bhishma and circumambulating him, ascended their<br>handsome cars. Those heroes then proceeded, accompanied by many other<br>cars decked with golden Kuvaras, and infuriated elephants looking like<br>mountains and steeds fleet as Garudas, and foot-soldiers armed with bows<br>and weapons. That army, moving with great speed, proceeded in two<br>divisions, one in the van and the other in the rear of those princes. The<br>scene resembled the two currents of the great river Narmada at the point<br>where it is divided by the Rikshavat mountains standing across it.<br>Gladdening that great host, the divine Chandramas rose before it in the<br>firmament, once more inspiring with moisture, by his own force, the<br>terrestrial herbs and plants whose juice had been sucked up by the Sun.<br>Then that bull of Yadu's race and the sons of Pandu, entering the (Kuru)<br>city whose splendour resembled that of the city of Indra itself,<br>proceeded to their respective mansions like tired lions seeking their<br>caves.'"
