                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grand-sire, what regions are earned by<br>unreturning heroes by encountering death in battle."<br><br>"Bhishma, said, 'In this connection, O Yudhishthira, is cited the old<br>story of the discourse between Amvarisha and Indra. Amvarisha, the son of<br>Nabhaga, having repaired to heaven that is so difficult of acquisition,<br>beheld his own generalissimo in those celestial regions in the company of<br>Indra. The king saw his puissant general blazing with every kind of<br>energy, endued with celestial form, seated on a very beautiful car, and<br>journeying (in that vehicle) up and up towards still higher regions.<br>Beholding the prosperity of his general Sudeva, and observing how he<br>traversed regions that were still higher, the high-souled Amvarisha,<br>filled with surprise, addressed Vasava, in the following words.'<br><br>"Amvarisha said, 'Having duly governed the whole earth bounded by the<br>seas, having from desire of earning religious merit practised all those<br>duties that are common to the four orders as declared by the scriptures,<br>having practised with rigid austerity all the duties of the Brahmacharya<br>mode, having waited with dutiful obedience upon my preceptors and other<br>reverend seniors, having studied with due observances the Vedas and the<br>scriptures on kingly duties, having gratified guests with food and drink,<br>the Pitris with offerings in Sraddhas, the Rishis with attentive study of<br>the scriptures and with initiation (under proper forms into the mysteries<br>of religion), and the gods with many excellent and high sacrifices,<br>having duly observed Kshatriya duties according to the injunctions of the<br>scriptures, having cast my eyes fearlessly upon hostile troops, I won<br>many victories in battle, O Vasava! This Sudeva, O chief of the deities,<br>was formerly the generalissimo of my forces. It is true. He was a warrior<br>of tranquil soul. For what reason, however, has he succeeded in<br>transcending me? He never worshipped the gods in high and great<br>sacrifices. He never gratified the Brahmanas (by frequent and costly<br>presents) according to the ordinance. For what reason, then, has he<br>succeeded in transcending me?'<br><br>"Indra said, 'Regarding this Sudeva, O sire, the great sacrifice of<br>battle had often been spread out by him. The same becomes the case with<br>every other man that engages in fight. Every warrior accoutred in armour,<br>by advancing against foes in battle array, becomes installed in that<br>sacrifice. Indeed, it is a settled conclusion that such a person, by<br>acting in this way, comes to be regarded as the performer of the<br>sacrifice of battle.'<br><br>"Amvarisha said, 'What constitutes the libations in that sacrifice? What<br>constitutes its liquid offerings? What is its Dakshina? Who, again, are<br>regarded its Ritwijas? Tell me all this, O performer of a hundred<br>sacrifices.'<br><br>"Indra said, 'Elephants constitute the Ritwijas of that sacrifice, and<br>steeds are its Audharyus. The flesh of foes constitutes ifs libations,<br>and blood is its liquid offering.[290] Jackals and vultures and ravens,<br>as also winged shafts, constitute its Sadasyas. These drink the remnants<br>left of the liquid offering in this sacrifice and eat the remnants of its<br>libations. Heaps of lances and spears, of swords and darts and axes,<br>blazing, sharp, and well-tempered, constitute the ladles of the<br>sacrificer. Straight, sharp, and well-tempered arrows, with keen points<br>and capable of piercing the bodies of foes, impelled from well-stretched<br>bows, constitute its large double-mouthed ladles. Sheathed in scabbards<br>made of tiger-skin and equipped with handles made of ivory, and capable<br>of cutting off the elephant's trunk, the swords form the Sphises of this<br>sacrifice.[291] The strokes inflicted with blazing and keen lances and<br>darts and swords and axes, all made of hard iron, constitute its profuse<br>wealth procured from the respectable people by agreement in respect of<br>the amount and period. The blood that runs over the field in consequence<br>of the fury of the attack, constitutes the final libation, fraught with<br>great merit and capable of granting every wish, in the Homa of this<br>sacrifice. Cut, Pierce, and such other sounds, that are heard in the<br>front ranks of the array, constitute the Samans sung by its Vedic<br>chanters in the abode of Yama. The front ranks of the enemy's array<br>constitute the vessel for the keep of its libations. The crowd of<br>elephants and steeds and men equipped with shields are regarded to<br>constitute the Syenachit fire of that sacrifice. The headless trunks that<br>rise up after thousands have been slaughtered constitute the octagonal<br>stake, made of Khadira wood, for the hero who performs that sacrifice.<br>The shrieks that elephants utter when urged on with hooks, constitute its<br>Ida mantras. The kettle-drums, with the slaps of palms forming the<br>Vashats, O king, are its Trisaman Udgatri. When the property or a<br>Brahmana is being taken away, he who casts off his body that is so dear<br>for protecting that property, does, by that act of self-devotion, acquire<br>the merit or a sacrifice with infinite presents. That hero who, for the<br>sake of his master, displays prowess at the van of the array and shows<br>not his back through fear, earns those regions of felicity that are mine.<br>He who strews the altar of the sacrifice constituted by battle, with<br>swords cased in blue scabbards and severed arms resembling heavy<br>bludgeons, succeeds in winning regions of felicity like mine. That<br>warrior who, resolved upon obtaining victory, penetrates into the midst<br>of the enemy's ranks without waiting for any assistance, succeeds in<br>winning regions of felicity like mine. That warrior who in battle, causes<br>a river of blood to flow, terrible and difficult to cross, having<br>kettle-drums for its frogs and tortoises, the bones of heroes for its<br>sands, blood and flesh for its mire, swords and shields for its rafts,<br>the hair of slain warriors for its floating weeds and moss, the crowds of<br>steeds and elephants and cars for its bridges, standards and banners for<br>its bushes of cane, the bodies or slain elephants for its boats and huge<br>alligators, swords and scimitars for its larger vessels, vultures and<br>Kankas and ravens for the rafts that float upon it, that warrior who<br>causes such a river, difficult of being crossed by even those that are<br>possessed of courage and power and which inspires all timid men with<br>dread, is said to complete the sacrifice by performing the final<br>ablutions. That hero whose altar (in such a sacrifice) is strewn over<br>with the (severed) heads of foes, of steeds, and of elephants, obtains<br>regions of felicity like mine. The sages have said that that warrior who<br>regards the van of the hostile army as the chambers of his wives, who<br>looks upon the van of his own army as the vessel for the keep of<br>sacrificial offering, who takes the combatants standing to his south for<br>his Sadasyas and those to his north as his Agnidhras, and who looks upon<br>the hostile forces as his wedded wife, succeeds in winning all regions of<br>felicity.[292] The open space lying between two hosts drawn up for fight<br>constitutes the altar of such a sacrificer, and the three Vedas are his<br>three sacrificial fires. Upon that altar, aided by the recollection of<br>the Vedas, he performs his sacrifice. The inglorious warrior who, turning<br>away from the fight in fear, is slain by foes, sinks into hell. There is<br>no doubt in this. That warrior, on the other hand, whose blood drenches<br>the sacrificial altar already strewn with hair and flesh and bones,<br>certainly succeeds in attaining a high end. That powerful warrior who,<br>having slain the commander of the hostile army, mounts the vehicle of his<br>fallen antagonist, comes to be regarded as possessed of the prowess of<br>Vishnu himself and the intelligence of Vrihaspati, the preceptor of the<br>celestials. That warrior who call seize alive the commander of the<br>hostile army or his son or some other respected leader, succeeds in<br>winning regions of felicity like mine. One should never grieve for a hero<br>slain in battle. A slain hero, if nobody grieves for him, goes to heaven<br>and earns the respect of its denizens. Men do not desire to dedicate (for<br>his salvation) food and drink. Nor do they bathe (after receiving the<br>intelligence), nor go into mourning for him. Listen to me as I enumerate<br>the felicity that is in store for such a person. Foremost of Apsaras,<br>numbering by thousands, go out with great speed (for receiving the spirit<br>of the slain hero) coveting him for their lord. That Kshatriya who duly<br>observes his duty in battle, acquires by that act the merit of penances<br>and of righteousness. Indeed, such conduct on his part conforms with the<br>eternal path of duty. Such a man obtains the merits of all the four modes<br>of life. The aged and the children should not be slain; nor one that is a<br>woman; not one that is flying, away; nor one that holds a straw in his<br>lips[293]; nor one that says. 'I am thine.' Having slain in battle<br>Jambha, Vritra, Vala, Paka, Satamaya, Virochana, the irresistible<br>Namuchi, Samvara of innumerable illusions, Viprachitti,&#8212;all these sons<br>of Diti and Danu, as also Prahlada, I myself have become the chief of the<br>celestials.'<br><br>'Bhishma continued, 'Hearing these words of Sakra and approving of them,<br>king Amvarisha comprehended how warriors succeed, (by battle as their<br>means) in compassing success for themselves (in respect of winning<br>regions of beatitude in heaven).'"
