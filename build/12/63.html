                            "Bhishma said, 'Drawing the bow-string, destruction of foes, agriculture,<br>trade, tending cattle, and serving others for wealth, these are improper<br>for a Brahmana. An intelligent Brahmana, leading a domestic mode of life,<br>should duly perform the six Vedic acts. The retirement of a Brahmana into<br>the woods, after having duly discharged all the duties of the domestic<br>mode of life, is applauded. A Brahmana should avoid service of the king,<br>wealth obtained by agriculture, sustenance derived from trade, all kinds<br>of crooked behaviour, companionship with any but his wedded wives, and<br>usury. That wretched Brahmana who falls away from his duties and whose<br>behaviour becomes wicked, becomes, O king, a Sudra. The Brahmana who weds<br>a Sudra woman, who becomes vile in conduct or a dancer or a village<br>servant or does other improper acts, becomes a Sudra. Whether he recites<br>the Vedas or not, O king, if he does such improper acts, he becomes equal<br>to a Sudra and on occasions of feeding he should be assigned a place<br>amongst Sudras. Such Brahmanas become equal to Sudras, O king, and should<br>be discarded on occasions of worshipping the Gods.[197] Whatever presents<br>of food dedicated to the gods and the Pitris are made unto Brahmanas that<br>have transgressed all restraints or become impure in behaviour or<br>addicted to wicked pursuits and cruel acts or fallen away from their<br>legitimate duties, confer no merit (on the giver). For this reason, O<br>king, self-restraint and purity and simplicity have been laid down as the<br>duties of a Brahmana. Besides these, O monarch, all the four modes, of<br>life were laid down by Brahman For him. He that is self-restrained, has<br>drunk the Soma in sacrifices, is of good behaviour, has compassion for<br>all creatures and patience to bear everything, has no desire of bettering<br>his position by acquisition of wealth, is frank and simple, mild, free<br>from cruelty, and forgiving, is truly a Brahmana and not he that is<br>sinful in acts. Men desirous of acquiring virtue, seek the assistance, O<br>king, of Sudras and Vaisyas and Kshatriyas. If, therefore, the members of<br>these (three) orders do not adopt peaceful duties (so as to be able to<br>assist others in the acquisition of virtue), Vishnu, O son of Pandu,<br>never extends his grace to them. If Vishnu be not pleased, the happiness<br>of all men in heaven, the merit arising from the duties laid down for the<br>four orders, the declarations of the Vedas, all kinds of sacrifices, and<br>all other religious acts of men, and all the duties in respect of the<br>several modes of life, become lost.<br><br>"'Listen now, O son of Pandu, to those duties that should be observed in<br>the four modes of life. These should be known by the Kshatriya who<br>desires the members of the three (other) orders (in his kingdom) to<br>strictly adhere to the respective duties of those modes. For a Sudra who<br>is desirous of hearing (Such scriptures as are not forbidden in his<br>case),[198] who has accomplished his duties, who has begotten a son,<br>between whom and the superior orders there is not Much difference in<br>consequence of the purity of his conduct, all the modes of life have been<br>laid down excepting the observance of universal peacefulness and<br>self-restraint (which are not necessary for him). For a Sudra practising<br>all these duties as also for a Vaisya, O king, and a Kshatriya, the<br>Bhikshu mode of life has been laid down. Having discharged the duties of<br>his order, and having also served the kin, a Vaisya of venerable years,<br>with the king's permission, may betake himself to another mode of life.<br>Having studied the Vedas duly and the treatises on the duties of kings, O<br>sinless one, having begotten children and performed other acts of a like<br>nature, having quaffed the Soma and ruled over and protected all his<br>subjects righteously, O foremost of speakers, having performed the<br>Rajasuya, the horse sacrifice, and other great sacrifices, having invited<br>learned Brahmanas for reciting the scriptures and made presents unto them<br>according to their desires, having obtained victories small or great in<br>battle, having placed on his throne the son of his loins or some<br>Kshatriya of good birth for the protection of subjects, having worshipped<br>the Pitris by performing with due rites the sacrifices laid down for<br>honouring them, having attentively worshipped the gods by performing<br>sacrifices and the Rishis by studying the Vedas, the Kshatriya, who in<br>old age desires another mode of life, may, O king, adopt it by leaving<br>that one which immediately precedes it, and by that means he is sure to<br>obtain (ascetic) success. A Kshatriya, for leading the life of a Rishi, O<br>king, may adopt the Bhikshu mode of life; but he should never do so for<br>the sake of enjoying the pleasures of the world. Having left the domestic<br>mode of life, he may adopt the life of mendicancy by begging, what would<br>barely support his life. A life of mendicancy is not obligatory upon the<br>three orders (viz. Kshatriyas, Vaisyas. and Sudras), O giver of profuse<br>presents! Inasmuch, however, as they can adopt it if they choose, this<br>mode of life, therefore, is open to the four orders. Amongst men, the<br>highest duties are those which are practised by Kshatriyas. The whole<br>world is subject to the might of their arms. All the duties, principal<br>and subordinate, of the three other orders, are dependent (for their<br>observance) upon the duties of the Kshatriya. The Vedas have declared<br>this. Know that as the footprints of all other animals are engulfed in<br>those of the elephant, even so all the duties of the other orders, under<br>every circumstance, are engulfed, in those of the Kshatriya. Men<br>conversant with the scriptures say that the duties of the other three<br>orders afford small relief or protection, and produce small rewards. The<br>learned have said that the duties of the Kshatriya afford great relief<br>and produce great rewards. All duties have kingly duties for their<br>foremost. All the orders are protected by them. Every kind of<br>renunciation occurs in kingly duties, O monarch, and renunciation has<br>been said to be in eternal virtue and the foremost of all.[199] If the<br>science of chastisement disappears, the Vedas will disappear. All those<br>scriptures also that inculcate the duties of men become lost. Indeed, if<br>these ancient duties belonging to the Kshatriyas be abandoned, all the<br>duties in respect of all the modes of life, become lost. All kinds of<br>renunciation are seen in kingly duties: all kinds or initiation occur in<br>them; all kinds of learning are connected with them; and all kinds of<br>worldly behaviour enter into them. As animals, if slaughtered by the<br>vulgar, become the means of destroying the virtue and the religious acts<br>of the slaughterers, even so all other duties, if deprived of the<br>protection given by kingly duties, become liable to attack and<br>destruction, and men, full of anxiety, disregard the practices laid down<br>for them.'"
