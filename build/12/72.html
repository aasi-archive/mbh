                            "Bhishma said, 'That person, O king, who would protect the good and<br>punish the wicked, should be appointed as his priest by the king. In this<br>connection is cited the old story about the discourse between Pururavas,<br>the son of Aila and Matariswan.'<br><br>"Pururavas said, 'Whence has the Brahmana sprung and whence the three<br>other orders? For what reason also has the Brahmana become the foremost?<br>It behoveth thee to tell me all this.'<br><br>"Matariswan answered, 'The Brahmana, O best of kings, has sprung from the<br>mouth of Brahman. The Kshatriya has sprung from his two arms, and the<br>Vaisya from his two thighs. For waiting upon these three orders, O ruler<br>of men, a fourth order, viz., the Sudra, sprung into life, being created<br>from the feet (of Brahman). Originally created thus, the Brahmana takes<br>birth on earth as the lord of all creatures, his duty being the keep of<br>the Vedas and the other scriptures.[230] Then, for ruling the earth and<br>wielding the rod of chastisement and protecting all creatures, the second<br>order, viz., the Kshatriya was created. The Vaisya was created for<br>supporting the two other orders and himself by cultivation and trade, and<br>finally, it was ordained by Brahman that the Sudra should serve the three<br>orders as a menial.'<br><br>"Pururavas said, 'Tell me truly, O god of Winds, to whom, this earth<br>righteously belong. Does it belong to the Brahmana or to the Kshatriya?'<br><br>"The god of Winds said, 'Everything that exists in the universe belongs<br>to the Brahmana in consequence of his birth and precedence. Persons<br>conversant with morality say this. What the Brahmana eats is his own. The<br>place he inhabits is his own. What he gives away is his own. He deserves<br>the veneration of all the (other) orders. He is the first-born and the<br>foremost. As a woman, in the absence of her husband, accepts his younger<br>brother for him, even so the earth, in consequence of the refusal of the<br>Brahmana, has accepted his next-born, viz., the Kshatriya, for her lord.<br>This is the first rule. In times, however, of distress, there is an<br>exception of this. If thou seekest to discharge the duties of the order<br>and wishest to obtain the highest place in heaven, then give unto the<br>Brahmana all the land thou mayst succeed in conquering, unto him that is<br>possessed of learning and virtuous conduct, that is conversant with<br>duties and observant of penances, that is satisfied with the duties of<br>his order and not covetous of wealth. The well-born Brahmana, possessed<br>of wisdom and humility, guides the king in every matter by his own great<br>intelligence. By means of sound counsels he causes the king to earn<br>prosperity. The Brahmana points out to the king the duties the latter is<br>to observe. As long as a wise king, observant of the duties of his order,<br>and bereft of pride, is desirous of listening to the instructions of the<br>Brahmana, so long is he honoured and so long does he enjoy fame. The<br>priest of the king, therefore, has a share in the merit that the king<br>acquires. When the king behaves himself thus, all his subjects, relying<br>upon him, become virtuous in their behaviour, attentive to their duties,<br>and freed from every fear. The king obtains a fourth part of those<br>righteous acts which his subjects, properly protected by him, perform in<br>his kingdom. The gods, men, Pitris, Gandharvas, Uragas, and Rakshasas,<br>all depend upon sacrifices for their support. In a country destitute of a<br>king, there can be no sacrifice. The gods and the Pitris subsist on the<br>offerings made in sacrifices. Sacrifice, however, depends upon the king.<br>In the season of summer, men desire comfort from the shade of trees, cool<br>water, and cool breezes. In the season of winter they derive comfort from<br>fire, warm clothes, and the sun. The heart of man may find pleasure in<br>sound, touch, taste, vision, and scent. The man, however, who is inspired<br>with fear, finds no pleasure in all these things. That person who dispels<br>the fears of men obtains great merit. There is no gift so valuable in the<br>three worlds as the gift of life. The king is Indra. The king is Yama.<br>The king is Dharma. The king assumes different forms. The king sustains<br>and supports everything.'"
