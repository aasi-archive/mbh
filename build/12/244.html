                            "Bhishma said, "Though hast been told what the duties of domesticity are<br>as ordained by the wise. Listen now, O Yudhishthira, to what those duties<br>are that have been next spoken of. Gradually abandoning the domestic<br>mode, one should enter the third mode which is excellent. It is the mode<br>in which wives afflict themselves by means of Austerities. It is the mode<br>practised by those that live as forest recluses. Blessed be thou, O son,<br>listen to the duties observed by those that lead this mode of life in<br>which occur the practices of all men and all modes of life. Listen,<br>indeed, to the duties of those that are denizens of sacred spots and that<br>have resorted to this mode after proper deliberation!'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'When the householder beholds wrinkles on his body and white<br>hair on his head, and children of his children, he should then retire<br>into the forest. The third part of his life he should pass in the<br>observance of the Vanaprastha mode. He should attend to those fires to<br>which he had attended as a householder. Desirous of sacrificing, he<br>should adore the deities (according to the rituals ordained). Observant<br>of vows and abstemious in diet, he should eat only once, the time thereof<br>being the sixth part of the day. He should be always heedful. Attending<br>to his fires, he should keep some kine, waiting upon them<br>dutifully.[1005] He should attend to all the rituals of a sacrifice. He<br>should live upon rice growing indigenously, upon wheat growing under<br>similar circumstances, upon grain of other kinds, growing wildly (and<br>belonging to none). He should eat what remains after feeding guests. In<br>this the third mode of life, he should present offerings of clarified<br>butter in the five well-known Sacrifices.[1006] Four kinds of courses of<br>conduct have been laid down for observance in the Vanaprastha mode of<br>life. Some collect only what is needed for the day. Some collect stores<br>to last for a month. Some store grain and other necessaries sufficient to<br>last for twelve years. Forest recluses may act in these ways for<br>worshipping guests and performing sacrifices. They should during the<br>season of the rains, expose themselves to rain and betake themselves to<br>water during the autumn. During the summer they should sit in the midst<br>of four fires with the sun burning overhead. Throughout the year,<br>however, they should be abstemious in diet.[1007] They sit and sleep on<br>the bare earth. They stand on only their toes. They content themselves<br>with the bare earth and with small mats of grass (owning no other<br>furniture for seat or bed). They perform their ablutions morning, noon,<br>and evening (preparatory to sacrifices). Some amongst them use only teeth<br>for cleaning grain. Others use only stones for that purpose.[1008] Some<br>amongst them drink, only during the lighted fortnight, the gruel of wheat<br>(or other grain) boiled very lightly.[1009] There are many who drink<br>similar gruel only during the dark fortnight. Some eat what only comes by<br>the way (without seeking to obtain it). Some adopting rigid vows, live<br>upon only roots, some upon only fruits, some upon only flowers, duly<br>observing the method followed by the Vaikhanasas. These and other diverse<br>observances are adopted by those men of wisdom and piety. The fourth is<br>(the mode called Renunciation) based upon the Upanishads. The duties laid<br>down for it may be observed in all the modes of life equally. This mode<br>differing from the others comes _after_ domesticity and forest life. In<br>this very Yuga, O son, many learned Brahmanas conversant with the truths<br>of all things, have been known to observe this mode. Agastya, the seven<br>Rishis (viz., Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Vasishtha, Narada, and<br>Kratu), Madhucchandas, Aghamarshana, Sankriti Sudivatandi who lived<br>withersoever he pleased and was content to take what came (without ever<br>seeking for anything).[1010] Ahovirya Kavya, Tandya, the learned<br>Medhatithi, Karmanirvaka of mighty energy, and Sunyapala who had exerted<br>himself greatly (for acquiring ascetic puissance) were the authors of<br>this course of duties, and themselves observing them have all proceeded<br>to heaven. Many great Rishis, O son, who had the puissance to behold<br>immediately the fruits of their ascetic merit,[1011] those numerous<br>ascetics who are known by the name of Yayavaras, many Rishis of very<br>austere penances and possessed of accurate knowledge in respect of<br>distinctions of duty, and many other Brahmanas too numerous to mention,<br>adopted the forest mode of life. The Vaikhanasas, the Valikhilyas, the<br>Saikatas, all of whom were devoted to austere penances,[1012] who were<br>steadfast in virtue, who had subdued their senses, and who used to behold<br>the fruits of their penances immediately, adopted this mode of life and<br>finally ascended to heaven. Freed from fear and not counted among the<br>stars and planets, these have become visible in the firmament as luminous<br>bodies.[1013] When the fourth or last part of life is reached, and when<br>one is weakened by decrepitude and afflicted by disease, one should<br>abandon the forest mode of life (for the fourth mode called<br>Renunciation). Performing a sacrifice that is capable of being completed<br>in a single day and in which the Dakshina should be everything of which<br>he may be possessed, he should himself perform his own Sraddha. Withdrawn<br>from every other object, he should devote himself to his own self, taking<br>pleasure in himself, and resting also on his own self.[1014] He should<br>establish all his sacrificial fires (thenceforth) upon his own self, and<br>give up all kinds of ties and attachments. (In case he fails to attain to<br>complete Renunciation) he should always perform such sacrifices and rites<br>as are completed in a single day.[1015] When, however, from performance<br>of the (ordinary) sacrifices of sacrificers, the Sacrifice in Self<br>proceeds, then (may he discontinue all ordinary sacrifices, and) unto the<br>three fires duly sacrifice in his own Self for the sake of his<br>Emancipation.[1016] Without finding fault with his food he should eat<br>five or six mouthfuls, offering them duly unto five vital airs uttering<br>(every time the well-known) mantras of the Yajurveda.[1017] Engaged in<br>the observance of austerities while leading the life of a forest recluse,<br>one should shave off one's hair and bristles and pare off one's nails,<br>and having cleansed oneself by acts, pass into the fourth and last mode<br>of life that is fraught with great holiness.[1018] That regenerate person<br>who enters the fourth mode of life, giving pledges of assurance unto all<br>creatures, succeeds in earning many regions of blazing effulgence<br>hereafter and ultimately attains to the Infinite.[1019] Of excellent<br>disposition and conduct, with sins all washed off, the person who is<br>conversant with his own self never desires to do any act for either this<br>or the other world. Freed from wrath and from error, without anxiety and<br>without friendship, such a person lives in this world like one totally<br>uninterested in its concerns. One (in the observance of Sannyasa) should<br>not feel reluctant in discharging the duties included in Yama and those<br>also that walk behind them (and are included in niyama). Such a one<br>should with energy live according to the ordinances in respect of his own<br>mode, and throw away Vedic study and the sacred thread that is indicative<br>of the order of his birth. Devoted to righteousness and with his senses<br>under complete control, such a one, possessed of knowledge of self,<br>attains undoubtedly to the end for which he strives.[1020] After the<br>third is the fourth mode of life. It is very superior, and fraught with<br>numerous high virtues. It transcends in point of merit the three other<br>modes of life. It is said to occupy the highest place. Listen to me as I<br>discourse upon the duties that belong to that mode which is pre-eminent<br>and which is the high refuge of all!'"
