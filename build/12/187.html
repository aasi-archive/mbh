                            "Bhrigu said, 'There is no destruction of the living creature, or of what<br>is given, or of our other acts. The creature that dies only goes into<br>another form. The body along dissolves away. The living creature, though<br>depending upon the body, does not meet with destruction when the body is<br>destroyed. It is not seen after the destruction of the physical frame<br>just as fire is not seen after the consumption of the fuel with which it<br>was ignited.'<br><br>"Bharadwaja said, 'If there is no destruction of the living creature like<br>that of fire, I submit, fire itself is not seen after consumption of the<br>fuel (that ignited it). When the supply of fuel is stopped, the fire<br>becomes extinguished, and, as far as I know, becomes annihilated. That<br>should surely be regarded to have met with destruction which has no<br>longer any action, which furnishes no proof of its existence, and which<br>no longer occupies any space.'<br><br>"Bhrigu said, 'It is true that upon the consumption of fuel fire is no<br>longer seen. It mingles with space because there is no longer any visible<br>object in which to inhere, and hence it becomes incapable of perception<br>by us. Similarly, upon leaving the body, the creature lives in space, and<br>cannot be seen in consequence of its extreme subtility as is doubtless<br>the case with fire. It is fire or heat that sustains the breaths called<br>Prana and the others. Know that that heat (thus existing) is called life<br>or the living agent. That heat which is the sustainer of the breaths,<br>becomes extinguished in consequence of the suppression of breath. Upon<br>that heat in the physical frame being extinguished, the frame itself<br>loses animation. Falling down, it is transformed into earth, for that is<br>its ultimate destination. The breath that is in all mobile and immobile<br>objects mingles with space, and the heat that is in them follows that<br>breath. These three (viz., space, air, and tire), mingle together. The<br>other two (viz., water and earth), exist together in the form of earth.<br>There is wind where space is, and there is fire where wind is. They are<br>formless, it should be known, and become endued with form only in respect<br>of embodied creatures.'<br><br>"Bharadwaja said, 'If in the physical frames of all living creatures<br>there are heat, wind, earth, space and water, what, then, are the<br>indications of living agent? Tell me these, O sinless one! I desire to<br>know the nature of the life that is in the bodies of living<br>beings,&#8212;bodies made up of the five primal elements, engaged in the five<br>acts, endued with the five senses and possessed of animation. Upon the<br>dissolution of the body which is a union of flesh and blood, and a mass<br>of fat, sinews and bones, that which is the living agent cannot be seen.<br>If this body, composed of the five elements, be destitute of what is<br>called life, who or what then is that which feels misery upon the<br>appearance of either bodily or mental pain? The living agent hears what<br>is said, with the aid of the ears. It, however, happens again, O great<br>Rishi, that the same agent hears not when the Mind is otherwise engaged.<br>It seems, therefore, that that which is called the living agent serves no<br>purpose. The whole scene that the living agent sees with eyes acting in<br>concert with the mind, the eye beholds not, even when lying before it, if<br>the mind be otherwise engaged. Then again, when it is under the influence<br>of sleep, that agent neither sees nor smells, nor hears, nor speaks, nor<br>experiences the perceptions of touch and taste. Who or what then is that<br>which feels joy, becomes angry, gives way to sorrow, and experiences<br>tribulation? What is that which wishes, thinks, feels aversion, and<br>utters words?'<br><br>"Bhrigu said, 'The mind also is made of the five elements in common with<br>the body. For this reason it is of no consequence with respect to the<br>acts mentioned by thee. Only the one internal Soul sustaineth the body.<br>It is he that perceives smell, taste, sound, touch and form and other<br>properties (that exist in external nature). That Soul, pervading all the<br>limbs, is the witness (of the acts) of the mind endued with five<br>attributes and residing within the body composed of the five elements. It<br>is he who feels pleasure and pain, and when separated from him the body<br>no longer experiences them. When there is no longer any perception of<br>form or of touch, when there is no heat in the fire that resides within<br>the body,&#8212;indeed, when that animal heat becomes extinguished,&#8212;the body,<br>in consequence of its abandonment by the Soul, meets with destruction.<br>The whole universe is composed of water. Water is the form of all<br>embodied creatures. In that water is the Soul which is displayed in the<br>mind. That Soul is the Creator Brahman who exists in all things. When the<br>Soul becomes endued with vulgar attributes, it comes to be called<br>Kshetrajna. When freed from those attributes, it comes to be called<br>Paramatman or Supreme Soul. Know that Soul. He is inspired with universal<br>benevolence. He resides in the body like a drop of water in a lotus. Know<br>well that which is called Kshetrajna and which has universal benevolence.<br>Darkness, Passion, and Goodness are the attributes of the living agent.<br>The learned say that the Soul has Consciousness and exists with the<br>attributes of life. The soul exerts and causes everything to exert.<br>Persons that have a knowledge of the Soul say that the Soul is different<br>from life. It is the Supreme Soul that has created the seven worlds and<br>sets them agoing. There is no destruction of the living agent when the<br>dissolution of the body takes place. Men destitute of intelligence say<br>that it dies. That is certainly untrue. All that the living agent does is<br>to go from one unto another body. That which is called death is only the<br>dissolution of the body. It is thus that the Soul, wrapped in diverse<br>forms, migrates from form to form, unseen and unnoticed by others.<br>Persons possessed of true Knowledge behold the Soul by their keen and<br>subtile intelligence. The man of wisdom, living on frugal fare, and with<br>heart cleansed of all sins, devoting himself to yoga meditation, succeeds<br>every night, before sleep and after sleep, in beholding his Soul by the<br>aid of his Soul.[561] In consequence of a contented heart, and by<br>abandoning all acts good and bad, one can obtain infinite happiness by<br>depending upon one's own Soul. The king, of fiery effulgence, residing<br>within the mind is called the living agent. It is from that Lord of<br>everything that this creation has sprung. Even this is the conclusion to<br>be arrived at in the enquiry into the origin of creatures and the soul.'
