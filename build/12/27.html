                            "Yudhishthira said, 'In consequence of the fall Abhimanyu of tender<br>years, of the sons of Draupadi, of Dhrishtadyumna, of Virata, of king<br>Drupada, of Vasusena conversant with every duty, of the royal<br>Dhrishtaketu, and of diverse other kings hailing from diverse regions, in<br>battle, grief does not forsake my wretched self that am a slayer of<br>kinsmen. Indeed, I am inordinately covetous of kingdom and am an<br>exterminator of my own race. He upon whose breast and limbs I used to<br>roll in sport, alas, that Ganga's son has been slain by me in battle<br>through lust of sovereignty. When I beheld that lion among men, viz., our<br>grandsire, assailed by Sikhandin and trembling and reeling in consequence<br>of Partha's shafts that resembled thunder-bolts in energy, when I beheld<br>his tall form pierced all over with blazing arrows and himself become<br>weak like an aged lion, my heart was deeply pained. When I beheld that<br>afflictor of hostile cars reel like a mountain summit and fall down<br>strengthless on the terrace of his own vehicle with his face turned<br>towards the east, my senses were stupefied. That scion of Kuru's race who<br>with bow and shaft in hand had contended in fierce battle for many days<br>with Rama himself of Bhrigu's line on the field sanctified by Kuru, that<br>son of Ganga, that hero, who, at Baranasi, for the sake of brides, had,<br>on a single car, challenged to battle the assembled Kshatriyas of the<br>world, he who had burnt by the energy of his weapons that irresistible<br>and foremost of kings, viz., Ugrayudha, alas, that hero has been caused<br>by me to be slain in battle. Knowing full well that Sikhandin the prince<br>of Panchala was his destroyer, that hero still refrained from slaying the<br>prince with his shafts. Alas, such a magnanimous warrior was slain by<br>Arjuna. O best of sages, at that moment when I beheld the grandsire<br>stretched on the earth and covered with blood, a violent fever afflicted<br>my heart. He who had protected and reared us when we were children, alas,<br>he was caused to be slain by my sinful self that am covetous of kingdom,<br>that am a slayer of reverend seniors, and a perfect fool, for the sake of<br>sovereignty that would last but a few days. Our preceptor, the great<br>archer Drona, adored by all the kings, was approached by me and addressed<br>falsely in respect of his son. The memory of that act of mine is burning<br>all my limbs. The preceptor said unto me, 'Tell me truly, O king, whether<br>my son liveth still. Expecting truth from me, the Brahmana asked me of<br>all others. By silently uttering the word elephant, I behaved falsely<br>towards him. Sinful that I am exceedingly covetous of kingdom, and a<br>slayer of my reverend seniors, I behaved even thus towards my preceptor<br>in battle, throwing off the garb of truth (which I was believed to wear),<br>for I said unto him that Aswatthaman had been killed when, in fact, an<br>elephant of that name had been slain. To what regions shall I go<br>(thereafter), having perpetrated such infamous deeds? I caused also my<br>eldest brother Karna to be slain, that terrible warrior who never<br>retreated from battle. Who is there more sinful than I? Through<br>covetousness I caused Abhimanyu of tender years, that hero who resembled<br>a lion born in the hills, to penetrate into the array that was protected<br>by Drona himself. I am like one guilty of infanticide. Sinful as I am, I<br>have not since then, been able to look Arjuna or the lotus-eyed Krishna<br>in the face. I grieve also few Draupadi who is bereft of her five sons<br>like the Earth bereft of her five mountains. I am a great offender, a<br>great sinner, and a destroyer of the earth! Without rising from this seat<br>that I now occupy, I will weaken my body (by starvation) and meet with<br>death. Know me who am the slayer of my preceptor as one that has sat down<br>here in the observance of the Praya vow. An exterminator of my race, I<br>must do so in order that I may not he reborn in any of other orders of<br>beings![78] I shall forgo all food and drink, and without moving from<br>this place, O great ascetic, shall dry up my life-breaths that are so<br>dear. I pray you with humility, grant me permission in this and go<br>whithersoever you please. Let every one grant me permission. I shall cast<br>off this body of mine.'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Restraining Pritha's son who, stupefied by<br>sorrow on account of his kinsmen, uttered such words, Vyasa, that best of<br>ascetics, spoke as follows, first telling him, 'This can not be!'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'It behoveth thee not, O monarch, to indulge in such<br>poignant grief. I shall repeat what I have once said. All this is<br>Destiny, O puissant one! Without doubt, all creatures that are born<br>display at first a union (of diverse materials and forces). Dissolution.<br>however, overtakes them at the end. Like bubbles in the water they rise<br>and disappear. All things massed together are sure to crumble away and<br>all things that rise must fall down. Union ends in dissolution and life<br>ends in death. Idleness, though temporarily agreeable, ends in misery,<br>and labour with skill, though temporarily painful, ends in happiness.<br>Affluence, Prosperity, Modesty, Contentment, and Fame dwell in labour and<br>skill but not in idleness. Friends are not competent to bestow happiness,<br>nor foes competent to inflict misery. Similarly wisdom does not bring<br>wealth nor does wealth bring happiness. Since, O son of Kunti, thou hast<br>been created by the Maker to engage thyself in Work. Success springs from<br>Work. Thou art not fit, O king, to avoid Work.'"
