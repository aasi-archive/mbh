                            "Yudhishthira said, 'If one does not succeed in winning over one's<br>kinsmen and relatives (by this course), they that are intended for<br>becoming friends become foes. How should one, then, conduct one's self so<br>that the hearts of both friends and foes may be won?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old history of a<br>discourse between Vasudeva and the celestial sage Narada. On a certain<br>occasion Vasudeva said, 'Neither an illiterate and foolish friend, nor a<br>learned friend of fickle soul, deserves, O Narada, to know one's secret<br>counsels. Relying on thy friendship for me, I shall say something to<br>thee, O sage! O thou that canst go to heaven at thy pleasure, one should<br>speak to another if one be convinced of the intelligence of that other. I<br>never behave with slavish obsequiousness towards my kinsmen by flattering<br>speeches about their prosperity. I give them half of what I have, and<br>forgive their evil speeches. As a fire-stick is grinded by a person<br>desirous of obtaining fire, even so my heart is ground by my kinsmen with<br>their cruel speeches. Indeed, O celestial Rishi, those cruel speeches<br>burn my heart every day. Might resides in Sankarshana; mildness in Gada;<br>and as regards Pradyumna, he surpasses even myself in beauty of person.<br>(Although I have all these on my side) yet I am helpless, O Narada! Many<br>others among the Andhakas and the Vrishnis are possessed of great<br>prosperity and might, and during courage and constant perseverance. He on<br>whose side they do not range themselves meets with destruction. He, on<br>the other hand, on whose side they do range themselves, achieves<br>everything. Dissuaded (in turns) by both (viz., Ahuka and Akrura,) I do<br>not side either of them. What can be more painful for a person than to<br>have both Ahuka and Akrura on his side? What, again, can be more painful<br>for one than not to have both of them on his side?[242] I am like the<br>mother of two brothers gambling against each other, invoking victory to<br>both. I am thus, O Narada, afflicted by both. It behoveth thee to tell me<br>that which is for the good of both myself and my kinsmen.'<br><br>"Narada said, 'Calamities, O Krishna, are of two kinds, viz., external<br>and internal. They arise, O thou of Vrishni's race, from one's own acts<br>or from the acts of others. The calamity that has now overtaken thee is<br>an internal one and is born of thy own acts. Valadeva and others of the<br>Bhoja race are partisans of Akrura, and have taken up his side either for<br>the sake of wealth, or mere caprice, or moved by words or by hate. As<br>regards thyself, thou hast given away wealth obtained by thee to another.<br>Though possessed of men who should be your friends, thou hast, however,<br>by thy own act, brought calamity over thy head. Thou canst not take back<br>that wealth, even as one cannot swallow again the food that he has<br>vomited himself. The kingdom cannot be taken back from Babhu and Ugrasena<br>(unto whom it has been given). Thyself, O Krishna, cannot, in particular,<br>take it back (from them) from fear of producing intestine dissensions.<br>Supposing the endeavour succeeds, it will do so after much trouble and<br>after the accomplishment of the most difficult feats. A great slaughter<br>and a great loss of wealth will ensue, perhaps, even total destruction.<br>Use then a weapon that is not made of steel, that is very mild and yet<br>capable of piercing all hearts. Sharpening and resharpening that weapon<br>correct the tongues of thy kinsmen.'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'What is that weapon, O sage, which is not made of steel,<br>which is mild, which still pierces all hearts, and which I must use for<br>correcting the tongues of my kinsmen?'<br><br>"Narada said, 'The giving of food to the best of thy power, forgiveness,<br>sincerity, mildness, and honour to whom honour is due, these constitute a<br>weapon that is not made of steel. With soft words alone turn away the<br>anger of kinsmen about the utter cruel speeches, and mollify their hearts<br>and minds and slanderous tongues. None who is not a great man with<br>cleansed soul and possessed of accomplishments and friends can bear a<br>heavy burthen. Take up this great weight (of governing the Vrishnis) and<br>bear it on thy shoulders. All oxen can bear heavy burthens on a level<br>road. The stronger ones only among them can bear such burthens on a<br>difficult road. From disunion destruction will spring and overtake all<br>the Bhojas and the Vrishnis. Thou, O Kesava, art the foremost one among<br>them. Do thou act in such a manner that the Bhojas and the Vrishnis may<br>not meet with destruction. Nothing but intelligence and forgiveness,<br>restraint of the senses, and liberality are present in a person of<br>wisdom. Advancing one's own race is always praiseworthy and glorious and<br>conducive to long life. Do thou, O Krishna, act in such a way that<br>destruction may not overtake thy kinsmen. There is nothing unknown to<br>thee in respect of policy and the art of war, O Lord! The Yadavas, the<br>Kukuras, the Bhojas, the Andhakas, and the Vrishnis, are all dependent on<br>thee even as all the worlds and all the regents of those worlds, O<br>mighty-armed one! The Rishis, O Madhava, always pray for thy advancement.<br>Thou art the lord of all creatures. Thou knowest the past, the present,<br>and the future. Thou art the foremost one among all the Yadavas. Relying<br>on thee, they expect to live in happiness.'"
