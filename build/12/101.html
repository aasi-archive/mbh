                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Of what disposition, of what behaviour, of what<br>form, how acoutred, and how armed should the combatants be in order that<br>they may be competent for battle?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'It is proper that those weapons and vehicles should be<br>adopted (by particular bodies of combatants) with which they have become<br>familiar by use. Brave soldiers, adopting those weapons and vehicles,<br>engage in battle. The Gandharvas, the Sindhus, and the Sauviras fight<br>best with their nails and lances. They are brave and endued with great<br>strength. Their armies are capable of vanquishing all forces, The<br>Usinaras are possessed of great strength and skilled in all kinds of<br>weapons. The Easterners are skilled in fighting from the backs of<br>elephants and are conversant with all the ways of unfair fight. The<br>Yavanas, the Kamvojas, and those that dwell around Mathura are well<br>skilled in fighting with bare arms. The Southerners are skilled in<br>fighting sword in hand. It is well-known that persons possessed of great<br>strength and great courage are born in almost every country. Listen to me<br>as I describe their indications. They that have voices and eyes like<br>those of the lion or the tiger, they that have a gait like that of the<br>lion and the tiger, and they that have eyes like those of the pigeon or<br>the snake, are all heroes capable of grinding hostile ranks.[303] They<br>that have a voice like deer, and eyes like those of the leopard or the<br>bull, are possessed of great activity. They whose voice resembles that of<br>bells, are excitable, wicked, and wrathful. They that have a voice deep<br>as that of the clouds, that have wrathful face, or faces like those of<br>camels, they that have hooked noses and tongues, are possessed of great<br>speed and can shoot or hurl their weapons to a great distance. They that<br>have bodies curved like that of the cat, and thin hair and thin skin,<br>become endued with great speed and restlessness and almost invincible in<br>battle. Some that are possessed of eyes closed like those of the iguana,<br>disposition that is mild, and speed and voice like the horses, are<br>competent to fight all foes. They that are of well-knit and handsome and<br>symmetrical frames, and broad chests, that become angry upon hearing the<br>enemy's drum or trumpet, that take delight in affrays of every kind, that<br>have eyes indicative of gravity, or eyes that seem to shoot out, or eyes<br>that are green, they that have faces darkened with frowns, or eyes like<br>those of the mongoose, are all brave and capable of casting away their<br>lives in battle. They that have crooked eyes and broad foreheads and<br>cheek-bones not covered with flesh and arms strong as thunder-bolts and<br>fingers bearing circular marks, and that are lean with arteries and<br>nerves that are visible, rush with great speed when the collision of<br>battle takes place. Resembling infuriated elephants, they become<br>irresistible. They that have greenish hair ending in curls, that have<br>flanks, cheeks, and faces fat and full of flesh, that have elevated<br>shoulders and broad necks, that have fearful visages and fat calves, that<br>are fiery like (Vasudeva's horse) Sugriva or like the offspring of<br>Garuda, the son of Vinata, that have round heads, large mouths, faces<br>like those of cats, shrill voice and wrathful temper, that rush to<br>battle, guided by its din, that are wicked in behaviour and full of<br>haughtiness, that are of terrible countenances, and that live in the<br>outlying districts, are all reckless of their lives and never flyaway<br>from battle. Such troops should always be placed in the van. They always<br>slay their foes in fight and suffer themselves to be slain without<br>retreating. Of wicked behaviour and outlandish manners, they regard soft<br>speeches as indications of defeat. If treated with mildness, they always<br>exhibit wrath against their sovereign.'"
