                            "Bhishma said, 'After Vyasa had left the spot, Narada, traversing through<br>the sky, came to Suka employed in studying the scriptures. The celestial<br>Rishi came for the object of asking Suka the meaning of certain portions<br>of the Vedas. Beholding the celestial Rishi Narada arrived at his<br>retreat, Suka worshipped him by offering him the Arghya according to the<br>rites laid down in the Vedas. Pleased with the honours bestowed upon him,<br>Narada addressed Suka, saying,&#8212;Tell me, O foremost of righteous persons,<br>by what means, O dear child, may I accomplish what is for thy highest<br>good!&#8212;Hearing these words of Narada, Suka, said unto him, O Bharata,<br>these words:&#8212;It behoveth thee to instruct me in respect of that which<br>may be beneficial to me:<br><br>'Narada said, In days of yore the illustrious Sanatkumara had said these<br>words unto certain Rishis of cleansed souls that had repaired to him for<br>enquiring after the truth. There is no eye like that of knowledge. There<br>is no penance like renunciation. Abstention from sinful acts, steady<br>practice of righteousness, good conduct, the due observance of all<br>religious duties,&#8212;these constitute the highest good. Having obtained the<br>status of humanity which is fraught with sorrow, he that becomes attached<br>to it, becomes stupefied: such a man never succeeds in emancipating<br>himself from sorrow. Attachment (to things of the world) is an indication<br>of sorrow. The understanding of person that is attached to worldly things<br>becomes more and more enmeshed in the net of stupefaction. The man who<br>becomes enmeshed in the net of stupefaction attains to sorrow, both here<br>and hereafter. One should, by every means in one's power, restrain both<br>desire and wrath if one seeks to achieve what is for one's good. Those<br>two (viz., desire and wrath) arise for only destroying one's good.[1756]<br>One should always protect one's penances from wrath, and one's prosperity<br>from pride. One should always protect one's knowledge from honour and<br>dishonour and, one's soul from error.[1757] Compassion is the highest<br>virtue. Forgiveness is the highest might. The knowledge of self is the<br>highest knowledge. There is nothing higher than truth. It is always<br>proper to speak the truth. It is better again to speak what is beneficial<br>than to speak what is true. I hold that that is truth which is fraught<br>with the greatest benefit in all creatures.[1758] That man is said to be<br>truly learned and truly possessed of wisdom who abandons every act, who<br>never indulges in hope, who is completely dissociated from all worldly<br>surroundings, and who has renounced everything that appertains to the<br>world. That person who, without being attached thereto, enjoys all<br>objects of sense with the aid of senses that are completely under his<br>control, who is possessed of a tranquil soul, who is never moved by joy<br>of sorrow, who is engaged in Yoga-meditation, who lives in companionship<br>with the deities presiding over his senses and dissociated also from<br>them, and who, though endued with a body, never regards himself as<br>identifiable with it, becomes emancipated and very soon attains to that<br>which is highest good. One who never sees others, never touches others,<br>never talks with others, soon, O ascetic, attains to what is for one's<br>highest good. One should not injure any creature. On the other hand, one<br>should conduct oneself in perfect friendliness towards all. Having<br>obtained the status of humanity, one should never behave inimically<br>towards any being. A complete disregards for all (worldly) things,<br>perfect contentments, abandonment of hope of every kind, and<br>patience,&#8212;these constitute the highest good of one that has subjugated<br>one's senses and acquired a knowledge of self. Casting off all<br>attachments, O child, do thou subjugate all thy senses, and by that means<br>attain to felicity both here and hereafter. They that are free from<br>cupidity have never to suffer any sorrow. One should, therefore, cast off<br>all cupidity from one's soul. By casting off cupidity, O amiable and<br>blessed one, thou shalt be able to free thyself from sorrow and pain. One<br>who wishes to conquer that which is unconquerable should live devoting<br>oneself to penances, to self-restraint, to taciturnity, to a subjugation<br>of the soul. Such a person should live in the midst of attachments<br>without being attached to them.[1759] That Brahmana who lives in the<br>midst of attachments without being attached to them and who always lives<br>in seclusion, very soon attains to the highest felicity. That man who<br>lives in happiness by himself in the midst of creatures who are seen to<br>take delight in leading lives of sexual union, should be known to be a<br>person whose thirst has been slaked by knowledge. It is well known that<br>that man whose thirst has been slaked by knowledge has never to indulge<br>in grief. One attains to the status of the deities by means of good acts;<br>to the status of humanity by means of acts that are good and bad; while<br>by acts that are purely wicked, one helplessly falls down among the lower<br>animals. Always assailed by sorrow and decrepitude and death, a living<br>creature is being cooked in this world (in the cauldron of Time). Dost<br>thou not known it? Thou frequently regardest that to be beneficial which<br>is really injurious; that to be certain which is really uncertain; and<br>that to be desirable and good which is undesirable and not good. Alas,<br>why dost thou not awake to a correct apprehension of these? Like a<br>silkworm that ensconces itself in its own cocoon, thou art continually<br>ensconcing thyself in a cocoon made of thy own innumerable acts born of<br>stupefaction and error. Alas, why chest thou not awake to a correct<br>apprehension of thy situation? No need of attaching thyself to things of<br>this world. Attachment to worldly objects is productive of evil. The<br>silk-worm that weaves a cocoon round itself is at last destroyed by its<br>own act. Those persons that become attached to sons and spouses and<br>relatives meet with destruction at last, even as wild elephants sunk in<br>the mire of a lake are gradually weakened till overtaken by Death.<br>Behold, all creatures that suffer themselves to be dragged by the net of<br>affection become subject to great grief even as fishes on land, dragged<br>thereto by means of large nets! Relatives, sons, spouses, the body<br>itself, and all one's possessions stored with care, are unsubstantial and<br>prove of no service in the next world. Only acts, good and bad, that one<br>does, follow one to the other world. When it is certain that thou shalt<br>have to go helplessly to the other world, leaving behind thee all these<br>things alas, why dost thou then suffer thyself to be attached to such<br>unsubstantial things of no value, without attending to that which<br>constitutes thy real and durable wealth? The path which thou shalt have<br>to travel through is without resting places of any kind (in which to take<br>rest). There is no support along that way which one may catch for<br>upholding oneself. The country through which it passes is unknown and<br>undiscovered. It is, again enveloped in thick darkness. Alas, how shalt<br>thou proceed along that way without equipping thyself with the necessary<br>expenses? When thou shalt go along that road, nobody will follow thee<br>behind. Only thy acts, good and bad, will follow behind thee when thou<br>shalt depart from this world for the next. One seeks one's object of<br>objects by means of learning, acts, purity (both external and internal),<br>and great knowledge. When that foremost of objects is attained, one<br>becomes freed (from rebirth). The desire that one feels for living in the<br>midst of human habitations is like a binding cord. They that are of good<br>acts succeed in tearing that bond and freeing themselves. Only risen of<br>wicked deeds do not succeed in breaking them. The river of life (or the<br>world) is terrible. Personal beauty or form constitutes its banks. The<br>mind is the speed of its current. Touch forms its island. Taste<br>constitutes its current. Scent is its mire. Sound is its waters. That<br>particular part of it which leads towards heaven is attended with great<br>difficulties. Body is the boat by which one must cross that river.<br>Forgiveness is the oar by which it is to be propelled. Truth is the<br>ballast that is to steady that boat. The practice of righteousness is the<br>string that is to be attached to the mast for dragging that boat along<br>difficult waters. Charity of gift constitutes the wind that urges the<br>sails of that boat. Endued with swift speed, it is with that boat that<br>one must cross the river of life. Cast off both virtue and vice, and<br>truth and falsehood. Having cast off truth and falsehood, do thou cast<br>off that by which these are to be cast off. By casting off all purpose,<br>do thou cast off virtue; do thou cast off sin also by casting off all<br>desire. With the aid of the understanding, do thou cast off truth and<br>falsehood; and, at last, do thou cast off the understanding itself by<br>knowledge of the highest topic (viz., the supreme Soul). Do thou cast off<br>this body having bones for its pillars; sinews for its binding strings<br>and cords; flesh and blood for its outer plaster; the skin for its outer<br>case; full of urine and faeces and, therefore, emitting a foul smell;<br>exposed to the assaults of decrepitude and sorrow; forming the seat of<br>disease and weakened by pain; possessed of the attribute of Rajas in<br>predominance: not permanent or durable, and which serves as the<br>(temporary) habitation of the indwelling creature. This entire universe<br>of matter, and that which is called Mahat or Buddhi, are made up of the<br>(five), great elements. That which is called Mahat is due to the action<br>of the Supreme. The five senses, the three attributes of Tamas, Sattwa,<br>and Rajas,&#8212;these (together with those which have been mentioned before)<br>constitute a tale of seventeen. These seventeen, which are known by the<br>name of the Unmanifest, with all those that are called Manifest, viz.,<br>the five objects of the five senses, (that is to say, form, taste, sound,<br>touch, and scent), with Consciousness and the Understanding, form the<br>well-known tale of four and twenty. When endued with these four and<br>twenty possessions, one comes to be called by the name of Jiva (or<br>Puman). He who knows the aggregate of three (viz., Religion, Wealth, and<br>Pleasure), as also happiness and sorrow and life and death, truly and in<br>all their details, is said to know growth and decay. Whatever objects<br>exist of knowledge, should be known gradually, one after another. All<br>objects that are apprehended by the senses are called Manifest. Whatever<br>objects transcend the senses and are apprehended by means only of their<br>indications are said to be Unmanifest. By restraining the senses, one<br>wins great gratification, even like a thirsty and parched traveller at a<br>delicious shower of rain. Having subjugated the senses one beholds one's<br>soul spread out for embracing all objects, and all objects in one's soul.<br>Having its roots in knowledge, the puissance is never lost of the man who<br>(thus) beholds the Supreme in his soul,&#8212;of the man, that is to say, who<br>always beholds all creatures in all conditions (in his own soul).[1760]<br>He who by the aid of knowledge, transcends all kinds of pain born of<br>error and stupefaction, never catches any evil by coming into contact<br>with all creatures.[1761] Such a man, his understanding being fully<br>displayed, never finds fault with the course of conduct that prevails in<br>the world. One conversant with Emancipation says that the Supreme Soul is<br>without beginning and without end; that it takes birth as all creatures;<br>that it resides (as a witness) in the Jiva-soul; that it is inactive, and<br>without form. Only that man who meets with grief in consequence of his<br>own misdeeds, slays numerous creatures for the purpose of warding off<br>that grief.[1762] In consequence of such sacrifices, the performers have<br>to attain to rebirths and have necessarily to perform innumerable acts on<br>every side. Such a man, blinded by error, and regarding that to be<br>felicity which is really a source of grief, is continually rendered<br>unhappy even like a sick person that eats food that is improper. Such a<br>man is pressed and grinded by his acts like any substance that is<br>churned. Bound by his acts, he obtains re-birth, the order of his life<br>being determined by the nature of his acts. Suffering many kinds of<br>torture, he travels in a repeated round of rebirths even like a wheel<br>that turns ceaselessly. Thou, however, hast cut through all thy bonds.<br>Thou, abstainest from all acts! Possessed of omniscience and the master<br>of all things, let success be thine, and do thou become freed from all<br>existent objects. Through subjugation of their senses and the power of<br>their penances, many persons (in days of yore), having destroyed the<br>bonds of action, attained to high success and uninterrupted felicity.'"
