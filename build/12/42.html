                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having heard those words, suitable to time and<br>place, of his subjects, king Yudhishthira answered them in the following<br>words, 'Great must be the sons of Pandu, in sooth, whose merits, true or<br>false, are thus recited by such foremost of Brahmanas assembled together.<br>Without doubt, we are all objects of favour with you since you so freely<br>describe us to be possessed of such attributes. King Dhritarashtra,<br>however, is our father and god. If ye desire to do what is agreeable to<br>me, always render your obedience to him and what is agreeable to him.<br>Having slaughtered all my kinsmen, I live for him alone. My great duty is<br>to always serve him in every respect with watchfulness. If ye, as also my<br>friends, think that I should be an object of favour with you and them,<br>let me then request you all to show the same behaviour towards<br>Dhritarashtra as ye used to show before. He is the lord of the world, of<br>yourselves, and of myself. The whole world, with the Pandavas, belongs to<br>him. Ye should always bear these words of mine in your minds.' The king<br>then told them to go whithersoever they liked. Having dismissed the<br>citizens and the people of the provinces, the delighter of the Kurus<br>appointed his brother Bhimasena as Yuvaraja. And he cheerfully appointed<br>Vidura of great intelligence for assisting him with his deliberations and<br>for overlooking the sixfold requirements of the state.[125] And he<br>appointed Sanjaya of mature years and possessed of every accomplishment,<br>as general director and supervisor of the finances. And the king<br>appointed Nakula for keeping the register of the forces, for giving them<br>food and pay and for supervising other affairs of the army. And king<br>Yudhishthira appointed Phalguna for resisting hostile forces and<br>chastising the wicked. And he appointed Dhaumya, the foremost of priests,<br>to attend daily to the Brahmanas and all rites in honour of the gods and<br>other acts of a religious kind. And he appointed Sahadeva to always<br>remain by his side, for the king thought, O monarch, that he should under<br>all circumstances be protected by that brother of his. And the king<br>cheerfully employed others in other acts according as he deemed them fit.<br>That slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the righteous-souled king<br>Yudhishthira, ever devoted to virtue, commanded Vidura and the<br>high-souled Yuyutsu, saying, 'You should always with alacrity and<br>attention do everything that my royal father Dhritarashthra wishes.<br>Whatever also should be done in respect of the citizens and the residents<br>of the provinces should be accomplished by you in your respective<br>departments, after taking the king's permission.'"
