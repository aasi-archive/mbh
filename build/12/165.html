                            "Bhishma said, 'For enabling such pious and impoverished Brahmanas as<br>have been robbed of their wealth (by thieves), as are engaged in the<br>performance of sacrifices, as are well conversant with all the Vedas, and<br>as are desirous of acquiring the merit of righteousness, to discharge<br>their obligations to preceptors and the Pitris, and pass their days in<br>reciting and studying the scriptures, wealth and knowledge, O Bharata,<br>should be given.[467] Unto those Brahmanas that are not poor, only the<br>Dakshina,[468] O best of the Bharatas, should be given. As regards those<br>that have fallen away (in consequence of their sinful deeds) from the<br>status of Brahman, uncooked food should be given to them outside the<br>limits of the sacrificial altar.[469] The Brahmanas are the Vedas<br>themselves and all the Sacrifices with large presents. Desirous of<br>excelling one another, they always perform sacrifices, impelled by their<br>virtuous inclinations. The king should, therefore, make presents of<br>diverse kinds of valuable wealth unto them. That Brahmana who hath a<br>sufficiency of stores for feeding his family for three or more years,<br>deserves to drink the Soma.[470] If not withstanding the presence of a<br>virtuous king on the throne, the sacrifice begun by anybody, especially<br>by a Brahmana, cannot be completed for want of only a fourth part of the<br>estimated expenses, then the king should, for the completion of that<br>sacrifice, take away from his kinsmen the wealth of a Vaisya that is<br>possessed of a large flock of cattle but that is averse from sacrifices<br>and abstains from quaffing Soma. The Sudra has no competence for<br>performing a sacrifice. The king should, therefore, take away (wealth for<br>such a purpose) from a Sudra house of ours.[471] The king should also,<br>without any scruple, take away from the kinsmen the wealth of him who<br>does not perform sacrifices though possessed of a hundred kine and also<br>of him who abstains from sacrifices though possessed of a thousand kine.<br>The king should always publicly take away the wealth of such a person as<br>does not practise charity, by acting in this way the king earns great<br>merit. Listen again to me. That Brahmana who has been forced by want to<br>go without six meals,[472] may take away without permission, according to<br>the rule of a person that cares only for today without any thought of the<br>morrow, only what is necessary for a single meal, from the husking tub or<br>the field or the garden or any other place of even a man of low pursuits.<br>He should, however, whether asked or unasked, inform the king of his<br>act.[473] If the king be conversant with duty he should not inflict any<br>punishment upon such a Brahmana. He should remember that a Brahmana<br>becomes afflicted with hunger only through the fault of the<br>Kshatriya.[474] Having ascertained a Brahmana's learning and behaviour,<br>the king should make a provision for him, and protect him as a father<br>protects the son of his own loins. On the expiry of every year, one<br>should perform the Vaisvanara sacrifice (if he is unable to perform any<br>animal or Soma sacrifice). They who are conversant with religion say that<br>the practice of an act laid down in the alternative, is not destructive<br>of virtue. The Viswedevas, the Sadhyas, the Brahmanas, and great Rishis,<br>fearing death in seasons of distress, do not scruple to have recourse to<br>such provisions in the scriptures as have been laid down in the<br>alternative. That man, however, who while able to live according to the<br>primary provision, betakes himself to the alternative, comes to be<br>regarded as a wicked person and never succeeds in winning any felicity in<br>heaven. A Brahmana conversant with the Vedas should never speak of his<br>energy and knowledge to the king. (It is the duty of the king to<br>ascertain it himself.) Comparing again the energy of a Brahmana with that<br>of the king, the former will always be found to be superior to the<br>latter. For this reason the energy of the Brahmanas can scarcely be borne<br>or resisted by a king. The Brahmana is said to be creator, ruler,<br>ordainer, and god. No word of abuse, no dry speeches, should be addressed<br>to a Brahmana. The Kshatriya should cross all his difficulties by the aid<br>of the might of his arms. The Vaisya and the Sudra should conquer their<br>difficulties by wealth; the Brahmana should do so by Mantras and homa.<br>None of these, viz., a maiden, a youthful woman, a person unacquainted<br>with mantras, an ignorant guy, or one that is impure, is competent to<br>pour libations on the sacrificial fire. If any of these do so, he or she<br>is sure to fall into hell, with him for whom they act. For this reason,<br>none but a Brahmana, conversant with the Vedas and skilled in all<br>sacrifices should become the pourer of sacrificial libations. They who<br>are conversant with the scriptures say that the man who, having kindled<br>the sacrificial fire, does not give away the dedicated food as Dakshina,<br>is not the kindler of a sacrificial fire. A person should, with his<br>senses under control, and with proper devotion, do all the acts of merit<br>(indicated in the scriptures). One should never worship the deities in<br>sacrifices in which no Dakshina is given. A sacrifice not completed with<br>Dakshina, (instead of producing merit) brings about the destruction of<br>one's children, animals, and heaven. Such a sacrifice destroys also the<br>senses, the fame, the achievements and the very span of life, that one<br>has. Those Brahmanas that lie with women in their season, or who never<br>perform sacrifices, or whose families have no members conversant with the<br>Vedas, are regarded as Sudras in act. That Brahmana who, having married a<br>Sudra girl, resides for twelve continuous years in a village has only a<br>well for its water supply, becomes a Sudra in act. That Brahmana who<br>summons to his bed an unmarried maiden, or suffers a Sudra, thinking him<br>worthy of respect, to sit upon the same carpet with him, should sit on a<br>bed of dry grass behind some Kshatriya or Vaisya and give him respect in<br>that fashion.[475] It is in this manner that he can be cleansed. Listen,<br>O king, to my words on this subject. The sin that a Brahmana commits in a<br>single night by respectfully serving a member of a lower order or by<br>sporting with him in the same spot or on the same bed, is cleansed by<br>observing the practice of sitting behind a Kshatriya or a Vaisya on a bed<br>of dry grass for three continuous years. A falsehood spoken in jest is<br>not sinful; nor one that is spoken to a woman. O king, nor one that is<br>spoken on an occasion of marriage; nor one spoken for benefiting one's<br>preceptor; nor one spoken for saving one's own life. These five kinds of<br>falsehood in speech, it has been said, are not sinful. One may acquire<br>useful knowledge from even a person of low pursuits, with devotion and<br>reverence. One may take up gold, without any scruple, from even an<br>unclean place. A woman that is the ornament of her sex may be taken (for<br>wife) from even a vile race. Amrita, if extracted from poison, may be<br>quaffed; women, jewels and other valuables, and water, can never,<br>according to the scriptures, be impure or unclean. For the benefit of<br>Brahmanas and kine, and on occasions of transfusion of castes, even a<br>Vaisya may take up weapons for his own safety. Drinking alcoholic<br>liquors, killing a Brahmana, and the violation of the preceptor's bed,<br>are sins that, if committed consciously, have no expiation. The only<br>expiation laid down for them is death. The same may be said of stealing<br>gold and the theft of a Brahmana's property. By drinking alcoholic<br>liquors, by having congress with one with whom congress is prohibited, by<br>mingling with a fallen person, and (a person of any of the other three<br>orders) by having congress with a Brahmani, one becomes inevitably<br>fallen. By mixing with a fallen person for one whole year in such matters<br>as officiation in sacrifices and teaching sexual congress, one becomes<br>fallen. One, however, does not become so by mixing with a fallen person<br>in such matters as riding on the same vehicle, sitting on the same seat,<br>and eating in the same line. Excluding the five grave sins that have been<br>mentioned above, all other sins have expiations, provided for them.<br>Expiating those sins according to the ordinances laid down for them, one<br>should not again indulge in them. In the case of those who have been<br>guilty of the first three of these five sins, (viz., drinking alcoholic<br>liquors, killing a Brahmana, and violation of the preceptor's bed), there<br>is no restriction for their (surviving) kinsmen about taking food and<br>wearing ornaments, even if their funeral rites remain unperformed when<br>they die. The surviving kinsmen should make no scruple about such things<br>on such occasions. A virtuous man should, in the observance of his<br>duties, discard his very friends and reverend seniors. In fact, until<br>they perform expiation, they that are virtuous should not even talk with<br>those sinners. A man that has acted sinfully destroys his sin by acting<br>virtuously afterwards and by penances. By calling a thief a thief, one<br>incurs the sin of theft. By calling a person a thief who, however, is not<br>a thief one incurs a sin just double the sin of theft. The maiden who<br>suffers her virginity to be deflowered incurs three-fourths of the sin of<br>Brahmanicide, while the man that deflowers her incurs a sin equal to a<br>fourth part of that of Brahmanicide. By slandering Brahmanas or by<br>striking them, one sinks in infamy for a hundred years. By killing a<br>Brahmana one sinks into hell for a thousand years. No one, therefore,<br>should speak ill of a Brahmana or slay him. If a person strikes a<br>Brahmana with a weapon, he will have to live in hell for as many years as<br>the grains of dust that are soaked by the blood flowing from the wounded.<br>One guilty of foeticide becomes cleansed if he dies of wounds received in<br>battle fought for the sake of kine and Brahmanas. He may also be cleansed<br>by casting his person on a blazing fire.[476] A drinker of alcoholic<br>liquors becomes cleansed by drinking hot alcohol. His body being burnt<br>with that hot drink, he is cleansed through death in the other<br>world.[477] A Brahmana stained by such a sin obtains regions of felicity<br>by such a course and not by any other. For violating the bed of a<br>preceptor, the wicked-souled and sinful wretch becomes cleansed by the<br>death that results from embracing a heated female figure of iron. Or,<br>cutting off his organ and testicles and bearing them in his hands, he<br>should go on in a straight course towards the south-west and then cast<br>off his life. Or, by meeting with death for the sake of benefiting a<br>Brahmana, he may wash off his sin. Or, after performing a horse-sacrifice<br>or a cow-sacrifice or an Agnishtoma, he may regain esteem both here and<br>hereafter. The slayer of a Brahmana should practise the vow of<br>Brahmacharya for twelve years and devoting himself to penances, wander,<br>holding in his hands the skull of the slain all the time and proclaiming<br>his sin unto all. He should even adopt such a course, devoted to penance<br>and leading the life of an ascetic. Even such is the expiation provided<br>for one who slays a woman quick with child, knowing her condition. The<br>man who knowingly slays such a woman incurs double the sin that follows<br>from Brahmanicide. A drinker of alcoholic liquor should live on frugal<br>fare, practising Brahmacharya vows, and sleep on the bare ground, and<br>perform, for more than three years the sacrifice next to the Agnishtoma.<br>He should then make a present of a thousand kine with one bull (unto a<br>good Brahmana). Doing all this, he would regain his purity. Having slain<br>a Vaisya one should perform such a sacrifice for two years and make a<br>present of a hundred kine with one bull. Having slain a Sudra, one should<br>perform such a sacrifice for one year and make a present of a hundred<br>kine with one bull. Having slain a dog or bear or camel, one should<br>perform the same penance that is laid down for the slaughter of a Sudra.<br>For slaying a cat, a chasa, a frog, a crow, a reptile, or a rat, it has<br>been said, one incurs the sin of animal slaughter, O king! I shall now<br>tell thee of other kinds of expiations in their order. For all minor sins<br>one should repent or practise some vow for one year. For congress with<br>the wife of a Brahmana conversant with the Vedas, one should for three<br>years practise the vow of Brahmacharya, taking a little food at the<br>fourth part of the day. For congress with any other woman (who is not<br>one's wife), one should practise similar penance for two years. For<br>taking delight in a woman's company by sitting with her on the same spot<br>or on the same seat, one should live only on water for three days. By<br>doing this he may cleanse himself of his sin. The same is laid down for<br>one who befouls a blazing fire (by throwing impure things on it). He who<br>without adequate cause, casts off his sire or mother or preceptor, surely<br>becomes fallen, O thou of Kuru's race, as the conclusion is of the<br>scriptures. Only food and clothes should be given, as the injunction is,<br>unto a wife guilty of adultery or one confined in a prison. Indeed, the<br>vows that are laid down for a male person guilty of adultery should be<br>caused to be observed by also a woman who is guilty of the same. That<br>woman who abandoning a husband of a superior caste, has congress with a<br>vile person (of a lower order), should be caused by the king to be<br>devoured by dogs in a public place in the midst of a large concourse of<br>spectators.[478] A wise king should cause the male person committing<br>adultery under such circumstances to be placed upon a heated bed of iron<br>and then, placing faggots underneath, burn the sinner thereon. The same<br>punishment, O king, is provided for the woman that is guilty of adultery.<br>The wicked sinner who does not perform expiation within a year of the<br>commission of the sin incurs demerit that is double of what attaches to<br>the original sin. One who associates with such a person for two years<br>must wander over the earth, devoting himself to penances and living upon<br>eleemosynary charity. One associating with a sinner for four years should<br>adopt such a mode of life for five years. If a younger brother weds<br>before his elder brother, then the younger brother, the elder brother and<br>the woman that is married, all three, in consequence of such wedding,<br>become fallen. All of them should observe the vows prescribed for a<br>person who has neglected his sacrificial fire, or practise the vow of<br>Chandrayana for a month, or some other painful vow, for cleansing<br>themselves of their sin. The younger brother, wedding, should give his<br>wife unto his unmarried elder brother. Afterwards, having obtained the<br>permission of the elder brother, the younger brother may take back his<br>wife. By such means may all three be cleansed of their sin. By slaying<br>animals save a cow, the slayer is not stained. The learned know that man<br>has dominion over all the lower animals. A sinner, holding in his hand a<br>yak-tail and an earthen pot, should go about, proclaiming his sin. He<br>should every day beg of only seven families, and live upon what may be<br>thus obtained. By doing this for twelve days he may be cleansed of his<br>sin. He who becomes unable to bear in his hand the yak-tail while<br>practising this vow, should observe the vow of mendicancy (as stated<br>above) for one whole year. Amongst men such expiation is the best. For<br>those that are able to practise charity, the practice of charity has been<br>laid down in all such cases. Those who have faith and virtue may cleanse<br>themselves by giving away only one cow. One who eats or drinks the flesh,<br>ordure, or urine, of a dog, a boar, a man, a cock, or a camel must have<br>his investiture of the sacred thread re-performed. If a Soma-drinking<br>Brahmana inhales the scent of alcohol from the mouth of one that has<br>drunk it, he should drink warm water for three days or warm milk for the<br>same period. Or, drinking warm water for three days he should live for<br>that period upon air alone. These are the eternal injunctions laid down<br>for the expiation of sin, especially for a Brahmana who has committed<br>these sins through ignorance and want of judgment.'"
