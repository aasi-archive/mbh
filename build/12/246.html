                            "Vyasa said, 'The Jiva-soul is endued with all those entities that are<br>modifications of Prakriti. These do not know the Soul but the Soul knows<br>them all. Like a good driver proceeding with the aid of strong,<br>well-broken, and high-mettled steeds along the paths he selects, the Soul<br>acts with the aid of these, called the senses, having the mind for their<br>sixth. The objects of the senses are superior to the senses themselves.<br>The mind is superior to those objects. The understanding is superior to<br>the mind. The Soul, also called Mahat, is superior to the understanding.<br>Superior to Mahat is the Unmanifest (or Prakriti). Superior to the<br>Unmanifest is Brahma. There is nothing Superior to Brahma. That is the<br>highest limit of excellence and the highest goal. The Supreme Soul is<br>concealed in every creature. It is not displayed for ordinary men to<br>behold. Only Yogins with subtile vision behold the Supreme Soul with the<br>aid of their keen and subtile understanding. Merging the senses having<br>the mind for their sixth and all the objects of the senses into the inner<br>Soul by the aid of the Understanding, and reflecting upon the three<br>states of consciousness, viz., the object thought, the act of thinking,<br>and the thinker, and abstaining by contemplation from every kind of<br>enjoyment, equipping his mind with the knowledge that he is Brahma's<br>self, laying aside at the same time all consciousness of puissance, and<br>thereby making his soul perfectly tranquil, the Yogin obtains that to<br>which immortality inheres. That person, however, who happens to be the<br>slave of all his senses and whose ideas of right and wrong have been<br>confounded, already liable as he is to death, actually meets with death<br>by such surrender of self to (the passions).[1036] Destroying all<br>desires, one should merge the gross Understanding into one's subtile<br>Understanding. Having thus merged the gross into the subtile<br>Understanding, one is sure to become a second Kalanjara mountain.[1037]<br>By purifying his heart, the Yogin transcends both righteousness and its<br>reverse. By purifying his heart and by living in his own true nature, he<br>attains to the highest happiness.[1038] The indication of that purity of<br>heart (of which I speak) is that one who has attained to experiences that<br>state of unconsciousness (with respect of all one's surroundings) which<br>one experiences in dreamless slumber. The Yogin who has attained to that<br>state lives like the steady flame of a lamp that burns in a place where<br>the atmosphere is perfectly still. Becoming abstemious in diet, and<br>having cleansed his heart, that Yogin who applies his Soul to the Soul<br>succeeds in beholding the Soul in the Soul.[1039] This discourse, O son,<br>intended for thy instruction, is the essence of all the Vedas. The truths<br>herein disclosed are incapable of being understood by the aid of<br>inference alone or by that of mere study of the scriptures. One must<br>understand it oneself by the aid of faith. By churning the wealth that is<br>contained in all religious works and in all discourses based on truth, as<br>also the ten thousand Richs, this nectar hath been raised. As butter from<br>curds and fire from wood, even hath this been raised for the sake of my<br>son,&#8212;this that constituteth the knowledge of all truly wise men. This<br>discourse, O son, fraught with solid instruction, is intended for<br>delivery unto Snatakas.[1040] It should never be imparted to one that is<br>not of tranquil soul, or one that is not self-restrained, or one that<br>hath not undergone penances. It should not be communicated to one that is<br>not conversant with the Vedas, or one that doth not humbly wait upon<br>one's preceptor, or one that is not free from malice, or one that is not<br>possessed of sincerity and candour, or one that is of reckless behaviour.<br>It should never be communicated to one whose intellect hath been consumed<br>by the science of disputation, or one that is vile or low. Unto that<br>person, however, who is possessed of fame, or who deserveth applause (for<br>his virtues), or who is of tranquil soul, or possessed of ascetic merit,<br>unto a Brahmana who is such, unto one's son or dutiful disciple, this<br>discourse containing the very essence of duties should be communicated,<br>but on no account should it be communicated to others. If any person<br>makes a gift of the whole earth with all her treasures, unto one<br>conversant with truth, the latter would still regard the gift of this<br>knowledge to be very much superior to that gift. I shall now discourse to<br>thee on a subject that is a greater mystery than this, a subject that is<br>connected with the Soul, that transcends the ordinary understandings of<br>human beings, that has been beheld by the foremost of Rishis, that has<br>been treated in the Upanishads, and that forms the topic of thy inquiry.<br>Tell me what, after this is in thy mind? Tell me in what thou has still<br>any doubt? Listen, for here I am, O son, faces turned towards all<br>directions. The Sun and the Moon are thy two seated before thee! Upon<br>what indeed, shall I once more speak to thee?'"
