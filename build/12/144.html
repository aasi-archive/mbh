                            "Bhishma said, 'In one of the branches of that tree, a pigeon with<br>beautiful feathers, O king, lived for many years with his family. That<br>morning his wife had gone out in search of food but had not yet returned.<br>Seeing the night had come and his wife still unreturned, the bird began<br>to indulge in lamentations: 'Oh, great has been the storm and painful the<br>shower that came today! Alas, thou has not yet returned, O dear wife! Woe<br>is on me, what can be the cause that she has not yet comeback to us? Is<br>every thing right with that dear spouse of mine in the forest? Separated<br>from her, this my home appears to me empty! A house-holder's home, even<br>if filled with sons and grandsons and daughters-in-law and servants, is<br>regarded empty if destitute of the housewife. One's house is not one's<br>home; one's wife only is one's home. A house without the wife is as<br>desolate as the wilderness. If that dear wife of mine, of eyes fringed<br>with red, of variegated plumes, and of sweet voice, does not come back<br>today, my life itself will cease to be of any value. Of excellent vows,<br>she never eats before I eat, and never bathes before I bathe. She never<br>sits before I sit down, and never lies before I lie down. She rejoices if<br>I rejoice, and becomes sorry when I am sorry. When I am away she becomes<br>cheerless, and when I am angry she ceases not to speak sweetly. Ever<br>devoted to her lord and ever relying upon her lord, she was ever employed<br>in doing what was agreeable to and beneficial for her lord. Worthy of<br>praise is that person on earth who own such a spouse. That amiable<br>creature knows that I am fatigued and hungry. Devoted to me and constant<br>in her love, my famous spouse is exceedingly sweet-tempered and worships<br>me devoutly. Even the foot of a tree is one's home if one lives there<br>with one's spouse as a companion. Without one's spouse, a very palace is<br>truly a desolate wilderness. One's spouse is one's associate in all one's<br>acts of Virtue, Profit and Pleasure. When one sets out for a strange land<br>one's wife is one's trusted companion. It is said that the wife is the<br>richest possession of her lord. In this world the wife is the only<br>associate of her lord in all the concerns of life.[433] The wife is ever<br>the best of medicines that one can have in sickness and woe. There is no<br>friend like unto the wife. There is no refuge better than the wife. There<br>is no better ally in the world than the wife in acts undertaken for the<br>acquisition of religious merit. He that has not in his house a wife that<br>is chaste and of agreeable speech, should go to the woods. For such a man<br>there is no difference between home and wilderness.'"
