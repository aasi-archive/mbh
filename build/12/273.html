                            "Yudhishthira said, 'By what means doth a man become sinful, by what doth<br>he achieve virtue, by what doth he attain to Renunciation, and by what<br>doth he win Emancipation?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Thou knowest all duties. This question that thou askest<br>is only for confirmation of thy conclusions. Listen now to Emancipation,<br>and Renunciation, and Sin, and Virtue to their very roots. Perceiving any<br>one of the five objects (viz., form, taste, scent, sound, and touch),<br>desire runs after it at first. Indeed, obtaining them within the purview<br>of the senses, O chief of Bharata's race, desire or aversion springs<br>up.[1295] One, then, for the sake of that object (i.e., for acquisition<br>of what is liked and avoidance of what is disliked) strives and begins<br>acts that involve much labour. One endeavours one's best for repeatedly<br>enjoying those forms and scents (and the three other objects of the<br>remaining three senses) that appear very agreeable. Gradually,<br>attachment, and aversion, and greed, and errors of judgment arise. The<br>mind of one overwhelmed by greed and error and affected by attachment and<br>aversion is never directed to virtue. One then begins with hypocrisy to<br>do acts that are good. Indeed, with hypocrisy one then seeks to acquire<br>virtue, and with hypocrisy one likes to acquire wealth. When one<br>succeeds, O son of Kuru's race, in winning wealth with hypocrisy, one<br>sets one's heart to such acquisition wholly. It is then that one begins<br>to do acts that are sinful, notwithstanding the admonitions of<br>well-wishers and the wise, unto all which he makes answers plausibly<br>consistent with reason and conformable to the injunctions of the<br>scriptures. Born of attachment and error, his sins, of three kinds,<br>rapidly increase, for he thinks sinfully, speaks sinfully, and acts<br>sinfully. When he fairly starts on the way of sin, they that are good<br>mark his wickedness. They, however, that are of a disposition similar to<br>that of the sinful man, enter into friendship with him. He succeeds not<br>in winning happiness even here. Whence then would he succeed in winning<br>happiness hereafter? It is thus that one becomes sinful. Listen now to me<br>as I speak to thee of one that is righteous. Such a man, inasmuch as he<br>seeks the good of others, succeeds in winning good for himself. By<br>practising duties that are fraught with other people's good, he attains<br>at last to a highly agreeable end. He who, aided by his wisdom, succeeds<br>beforehand in beholding the faults above adverted to, who is skilled in<br>judging of what is happiness and what is sorrow and how each is brought<br>about, and who waits with reverence upon those that are good, makes<br>progress in achieving virtue, both in consequence of his habit and such<br>companionship of the good. The mind of such a person takes delight in<br>virtue, and he lives on, making virtue his support. If he sets his heart<br>on the acquisition of wealth, he desires only such wealth as may be<br>acquired in righteous ways. Indeed, he waters the roots of only those<br>things in which he sees merit. In this way, doth one become righteous and<br>acquires friends that are good. In consequence of his acquisition of<br>friends, of wealth, and of children, he sports in happiness both here and<br>hereafter. The mastery (in respect of enjoyment) that a living creature<br>attains over sound, touch, taste, form, and scent, O Bharata, represents<br>the fruit of virtue.[1296] Remember this. Having obtained the fruit of<br>virtue, O Yudhishthira, such a man does not give himself up to joy.<br>Without being contented with such (visible) fruits of virtue he betakes<br>himself to Renunciation, led on by the eye of knowledge. When, having<br>acquired the eye of knowledge, he ceases to take pleasure in the<br>gratification of desire, in taste and in scent, when he does net allow<br>his mind to run towards sound, touch and form, it is then that he<br>succeeds in freeing himself from desire.[1297] He does not, however, even<br>then cast off virtue or righteous acts. Beholding then all the worlds to<br>be liable to destruction, he strives to cast off virtue (with its rewards<br>in the form of heaven and its happiness) and endeavours to attain to<br>Emancipation by the (well-known) means.[1298] Gradually abandoning all<br>sinful acts he betakes himself to Renunciation, and becoming<br>righteous-souled succeeds at last in attaining to Emancipation. I have<br>now told thee, O son, of that about which thou hadst asked me, viz., the<br>topics of Sin, Righteousness, Renunciation, and Emancipation, O Bharata!<br>Thou shouldst, therefore, O Yudhishthira, adhere to virtue in all<br>situations. Eternal is the success, O son of Kunti, of thee that adherest<br>to righteousness.'"[1299]
