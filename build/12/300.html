                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, learned men praise truth,<br>self-restraint, forgiveness, and wisdom. What is thy opinion of these<br>virtues?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection I shall recite to thee an old<br>narrative, O Yudhishthira, of the discourse between the Sadhyas and a<br>Swan. Once on a time the Unborn and eternal Lord of all creatures (viz.,<br>Brahman), assuming the form of a golden Swan, wandered through the three<br>worlds till in course of his wanderings he came upon the Sadhyas.'<br><br>"The Sadhyas said, 'O ford, we are the deities called Sadhyas. We like to<br>question thee. Indeed, we would ask thee about the religion of<br>Emancipation. Thou art well-acquainted with it. We have heard, O bird,<br>that thou art possessed of great learning, and eloquent and wise of<br>speech. O bird, what dost thou think is the highest of all objects? O<br>high-souled one, in what does thy mind find pleasure? Do thou, therefore,<br>O foremost of birds, instruct us as to what that one act is which thou<br>regardest as the foremost of all acts, and by doing which, O chief of the<br>feathery creation, one may soon be freed from all bonds.'<br><br>"The Swan said, 'Ye who have drunk Amrita, I have heard that one should<br>have recourse to these, viz., penances, self-restraint, truth, and<br>subjugation of the mind. Untying all the knots of the heart, one should<br>also bring under one's control both what is agreeable and what is<br>disagreeable.[1576] One should not wound the vitals of others. One should<br>not be an utterer of cruel speeches. One should never take scriptural<br>lectures from a person that is mean. One should never utter such words as<br>inflict pain on others, as cause others to burn (with misery), and as<br>lead to hell. Wordy shafts fall from the lips. Pierced therewith one (to<br>whom they are directed) burns incessantly. Those shafts do not strike any<br>part other than the very vitals of the person aimed. Hence he that is<br>possessed of learning should never aim them at others. If a person deeply<br>pierces a man of wisdom with wordy shafts, the wise mart should then<br>adopt peace (without giving way to wrath). The man who, though sought to<br>be angered, rejoices without yielding to anger, taketh away from the<br>provoker all his merits. That man of righteous soul, who, full of joy and<br>freed from malice, subdues his blazing wrath which, if indulged, would<br>lead him to speak ill of others and verily become his foe, takes away the<br>merits of others. As regards myself, I never answer I when another speaks<br>ill of me. If assailed, I always forgive the assault. The righteous are<br>of opinion that forgiveness and truth and sincerity and compassion are<br>the foremost (of all virtues). Truth is the arcanum of the Vedas. The<br>arcanum of Truth is self-restraint. The arcanum of self-restraint is<br>Emancipation. This is the teaching of all the scriptures. I regard that<br>person to be Brahmana and Muni who subjugates the rising impulse of<br>speech, the impulse of wrath appearing in the mind, the impulse of thirst<br>(after unworthy things), and the impulses of the stomach and the organ of<br>pleasure. One who does not yield to wrath is superior to one who does.<br>One who practises renunciation is superior to one who does not. One who<br>possesses the virtues of manhood is superior to one who has them not. One<br>who is endued with knowledge is superior to one who is destitute of it.<br>Assailed with harsh speeches one should not assail in return. Indeed, one<br>who, under such circumstances, renounces wrath, succeeds in burning the<br>assailant and taking away all his merits.[1577] That person who when<br>assailed with harsh speeches does not utter a harsh word in reply, who<br>when praised does not utter what is agreeable to him that praises, who is<br>endued with such fortitude as not to strike in return when struck and not<br>to even wish evil to the striker, finds his companionship always coveted<br>by the gods. He that is sinful should be forgiven as if he were<br>righteous, by one that is insulted, struck, and calumniated. By acting in<br>this way one attains to success. Though all my objects have been<br>fulfilled, yet I always wait reverentially on those that are righteous. I<br>have no thirst. My wrath hath been suppressed. Seduced by covetousness I<br>do not fall away from the path of righteousness. I do not also approach<br>any one (with solicitations) for wealth.[1578] If cursed, I do not curse<br>in return. I know that self-restraint is the door of immortality. I<br>disclose unto you a great mystery. There is no status that is superior to<br>that of humanity. Freed from sin like the Moon from murky clouds, the man<br>of wisdom, shining in resplendence, attains to success by patiently<br>waiting for his time. A person of restrained soul, who becomes the object<br>of adoration with all by becoming the foremost of the supporting pillars<br>of the universe, and towards whom only agreeable words are spoken by all,<br>attains to the companionship of the deities. Revilers never come forward<br>to speak of the merits of a person as they speak of his demerits. That<br>person whose speech and mind are properly restrained and always devoted<br>to the Supreme, succeeds in attaining to the fruits of the Vedas,<br>Penances, and Renunciation. The man of wisdom should never revile (in<br>return) those that are destitute of merit, by uttering their dispraise<br>and by insults. He should not extol others (being extolled by them) and<br>should never injure themselves. The man endued with wisdom and learning<br>regards revilement as nectar. Reviled, he sleeps without anxiety. The<br>reviler, on the other hand, meets with destruction. The sacrifices that<br>one performs in anger, the gifts one makes in anger, the penances one<br>undergoes in anger, and the offerings and libations one makes to the<br>sacred fire in anger, are such that their merits are robbed by Yama. The<br>toil of an angry man becomes entirely fruitless. Ye foremost of<br>immortals, that person is said to be conversant with righteousness whose<br>four doors, viz., the organ of pleasure, the stomach, the two arms, and<br>speech, are well-restrained. That person who, always practising truth and<br>self-restraint and sincerity and compassion and patience and<br>renunciation, becomes devoted to the study of the Vedas, does not covet<br>what belongs to others, and pursues what is good with a singleness of<br>purpose, succeeds in attaining to heaven. Like a calf sucking all the<br>four teats of its dam's udders, one should devote oneself to the practice<br>of all these virtues. I do not know whether anything exists that is more<br>sacred than Truth. Having roved among both human beings and the deities,<br>I declare it that Truth is the only means for reaching heaven even as a<br>ship is the only means for crossing the ocean. A person becomes like<br>those with whom he dwells, and like those whom he reverences, and like to<br>what he wishes to be. If a person waits with reverence on him who is good<br>or him who is otherwise, if he waits with reverence on a sage possessed<br>of ascetic merit or on a thief, passes under his way and catches his hue<br>like a piece of cloth catching the dye in which it is steeped. The<br>deities always converse with those that are possessed of wisdom and<br>goodness. They, therefore, never entertain the wish for even seeing the<br>enjoyments in which men take pleasure. The person who knows that all<br>objects of enjoyment (which human beings cherish) are characterised by<br>vicissitudes, has few rivals, and is superior to the very Moon and the<br>Wind.[1579] When the Purusha that dwells in one's heart is unstained, and<br>walks in the path of the righteous, the gods take a pleasure in him. The<br>gods from a distance cast off those that are always devoted to the<br>gratification of their organs of pleasure and the stomach, that are<br>addicted to thieving, and that always indulge in harsh speeches, even if<br>they expiate their offences by performing the proper rites. The gods are<br>never pleased with one of mean soul, with one who observes no<br>restrictions in the matter of food, and with one who is of sinful deeds.<br>On the other hand, the gods associate with those men that are observant<br>of the vow of truth, that are grateful, and that are engaged in the<br>practice of righteousness. Silence is better than speech. To speak the<br>truth is better than silence. Again to speak truth that is connected with<br>righteousness is better than to speak the truth. To speak that which,<br>besides being true and righteous, is agreeable, is better than to speak<br>truth connected with righteousness.'<br><br>"The Sadhyas said, 'By what is this world covered? For what reason does<br>one fail to shine? For what cause do people cast off their friends? For<br>what reason do people fail to attain to heaven?'<br><br>"The Swan said, 'The world is enveloped by (the darkness of) Ignorance.<br>Men fail to shine in consequence of malice. People cast off friends,<br>induced by covetousness. Men fail to attain to heaven in consequence of<br>attachment.'<br><br>"The Sadhyas said, 'Who alone among the Brahmanas is always happy? Who<br>alone amongst them can observe the vow of silence though dwelling in the<br>midst of many? Who alone amongst them, though weak, is still regarded as<br>strong? And who alone amongst them does not quarrel?'<br><br>"The Swan said, 'He alone amongst the Brahmanas that is possessed of<br>wisdom is always happy. He alone amongst the Brahmanas that is possessed<br>of wisdom succeeds in observing the vow of silence, though dwelling in<br>the midst of many. He alone amongst the Brahmanas who is possessed of<br>wisdom, though actually weak, is regarded as strong. He alone amongst<br>them that has wisdom succeeds in avoiding quarrel.'[1580]<br><br>"The Sadhyas said, 'in what consists the divinity of the Brahmanas? In<br>what their purity? In what their impurity? And in what their status of<br>humanity?'<br><br>"The Swan said, 'In the study of the Vedas is the divinity of the<br>Brahmanas. In their vows and observances is their purity. In obloquy is<br>their impurity. In death is their humanity.'[1581]<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus have I recited to thee excellent narrative of<br>the discourse between the Sadhyas (and the Swan). The body (both gross<br>and subtile) is the origin of acts, and existence or Jiva is truth.'
