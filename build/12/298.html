                            "Parasara said, 'The sires, the friends, the preceptor, and the spouses<br>of the preceptors of men that are destitute of devotion are unable to<br>give to those men the merits that attach to devotion. Only they that are<br>firmly devoted to such seniors, that speak what is agreeable to them,<br>that seek their welfare, and that are submissive to them in behaviour,<br>can obtain the merit of devotion. The sire is the highest of deities with<br>his children. It is said that the sire is superior to the mother. The<br>attainment of Knowledge is regarded as the highest acquisition. They that<br>have subjugated the objects of the senses (by attainment of Knowledge),<br>acquire what is highest (viz., Emancipation). That Kshatriya prince who,<br>repairing to the field of battle, receives wounds amid fiery shafts<br>flying in all directions and burns therewith, certainly repairs to<br>regions that are unattainable by the very deities and, arrived there,<br>enjoys the felicity of heaven in perfect contentment. A Kshatriya should<br>not, O king, strike one that is fatigued, or one that is frightened, or<br>one that has been disarmed, or one that is weeping, or one that is<br>unwilling to fight, or one that is unequipped with mail and cars and<br>horse and infantry, or one that has ceased to exert oneself in the fight,<br>or one that is ill, or one that cries for quarter, or one that is of<br>tender years, or one that is old. A Kshatriya should, in battle, fight<br>one of his order who is equipped with mail and cars and horse and<br>infantry, who is ready for exertion and who occupies a position of<br>equality. Death at the hands of one that is equal or of a superior is<br>laudable, but not that at the hands of one that is low, or of one that is<br>a coward, or of one that is a wretch. This is well-known. Death at the<br>hands of one that is sinful, or of one that is of low birth and wicked<br>conduct, O king, is inglorious and leads to hell. One whose period of<br>life has run out cannot be rescued by anybody. Similarly, one whose<br>period of life has not been exhausted can never be slain by any<br>one.[1547] One should prevent one's affectionate seniors from doing unto<br>one (for one's benefit) such acts as are done by menials, as also all<br>such acts as are fraught with injury to others. One should never desire<br>to extend one's own life by taking the lives of others.[1548] When they<br>lay down their lives, it is laudable for all householders observant of<br>the duties of men living in sacred places to lay down their lives on the<br>banks of sacred streams.[1549] When one's period of life becomes<br>exhausted, one dissolves away into the five elements. Sometimes this<br>occurs suddenly (through accidents) and sometimes it is brought about by<br>(natural) causes.[1550] He who, having obtained a body, brings about its<br>dissolution (in a. sacred place by means of some inglorious accident),<br>becomes invested with another body of a similar kind. Though set on the<br>path of the Emancipation, he yet becomes a traveller and attains to<br>another body like a person repairing from one room into another.[1551] In<br>the matter of such a man's attainment of a second body (notwithstanding<br>his death in a sacred spot) the only cause is his accidental death. There<br>is no second cause. That new body which embodied creatures obtain (in<br>consequence of the accidental character of their deaths in sacred places)<br>comes into existence and becomes attached to Rudras and Pisachas.[1552]<br>Learned men, conversant with Adhyatma, say that the body is a<br>conglomeration of arteries and sinews and bones and much repulsive and<br>impure matter and a compound of (primal) essences, and the senses and<br>objects of the senses born of desire, all having an outer cover of skin<br>close to them. Destitute (in reality) of beauty and other<br>accomplishments, this conglomeration, through force of the desires of a<br>previous life, assumes a human form.[1553] Abandoned by the owner, the<br>body becomes inanimate and motionless. Indeed, when the primal<br>ingredients return to their respective natures, the body mingles with the<br>dust. Caused by its union with acts, this body reappears under<br>circumstances determined by its acts. Indeed, O ruler of the Videhas,<br>under whatever circumstances this body meets with dissolution, its next<br>birth, determined by those circumstances, is seen to enjoy and endure the<br>fruits of all its past acts. Jiva, after dissolution of the body it<br>inhabited, does not, O king, take birth in a different body immediately.<br>It roves through the sky for some time like a spacious cloud. Obtaining a<br>new receptacle, O monarch, it then takes birth again. The soul is above<br>the mind. The mind is above the senses. Mobile creatures, again, are<br>foremost of all created objects. Of all mobile creatures those that have<br>two legs are superior. Amongst two-legged creatures, those that are<br>regenerate are superior. Amongst those that are regenerate they that are<br>possessed of wisdom are superior. Amongst them that are possessed of<br>wisdom they that have succeeded in acquiring a knowledge of the soul are<br>superior. Amongst those that are possessed of a knowledge of the soul,<br>they that are endued with humility are superior. Death follows birth in<br>respect of all men. This is settled. Creatures, influenced by the<br>attributes of Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas, pursue acts which have an<br>end.[1554] That man is regarded as righteous who meets with dissolution<br>when the Sun is in the northern declension, and at a time and under a<br>constellation both of which are sacred and auspicious. He. is righteous<br>who., having cleansed himself of all sins and accomplished all his acts<br>according to the best of his power and having abstained from giving pain<br>to any man, meets with death when it comes. The death that one meets with<br>by taking poison, by hanging, by burning, at the hands of robbers, and at<br>the teeth of animals, is said to be an inglorious one.[1555] Those men<br>that are righteous never incur such or similar deaths even if they be<br>afflicted with mental and physical diseases of the most agonising kind.<br>The lives of the righteous, O king, piercing through the Sun, ascend into<br>the regions of Brahma. The lives of those that are both righteous and<br>sinful rove in the middle regions. The lives of those that are sinful<br>sink into the lowest depths. There is only one foe (of man) and not<br>another. That foe is identifiable with ignorance, O king. Overwhelmed by<br>it, one is led to perpetrate acts that are frightful and exceedingly<br>cruel. That foe for resisting which one should put forth one's power by<br>waiting upon the aged according to the duties laid down in the<br>Srutis&#8212;that foe which cannot be overcome except by steady<br>endeavours,&#8212;meets with destruction., O king, only when it is crushed by<br>the shafts of wisdom.[1556] The man desirous of achieving merit should at<br>first study the Vedas and observe penances, becoming a Brahmacharin. He<br>should next, entering the domestic mode of life, perform the usual<br>Sacrifices. Establishing his race, he should then enter the forest,<br>restraining his senses, and desirous of winning Emancipation. One should<br>never emasculate oneself by abstaining from any enjoyment. Of all births,<br>the status of humanity is preferable even if one has to become a<br>Chandala. Indeed, O monarch, that order of birth (viz., humanity) is the<br>foremost, since by becoming a human being one succeeds in rescuing one's<br>self by meritorious acts. Men always perform righteous acts, O lord,<br>guided by the authority of the Srutis, so that they may not fall away<br>from the status of humanity. That man who, having attained to the status<br>of humanity that is so difficult of attainment, indulges in malice,<br>disregards righteousness and yields himself up to desire, is certainly<br>betrayed by his desires.[1557] That man who looks upon all creatures with<br>eyes guided by affection, regarding them worthy of being cherished with<br>loving aid, who disregards all kinds of wealth, who offers them<br>consolation, gives them food, address them in agreeable words, and who<br>rejoices in their happiness and grieves in their griefs, has never to<br>suffer misery in the next world, Repairing to the Saraswati, the Naimisha<br>woods, the Pushkara waters, and the other sacred spots on earth, one<br>should make gifts, practise renunciation, render one's aspect amiable, O<br>king, and purify one's body with baths and penances. Those men who meet<br>with death within their houses should have the rites of cremation<br>performed upon their persons. Their bodies should be taken to the<br>crematorium on vehicles and there they should be burnt according to the<br>rites of purification that have been laid down in the scriptures.<br>Religious rites, beneficial ceremonies, the performance of sacrifices,<br>officiation at the sacrifices of others, gifts, the doing of other<br>meritorious acts, the performance, according to the best of one's power,<br>of all that has been ordained in the case of one's deceased<br>ancestors,&#8212;all these one does for benefiting one's own self. The Vedas<br>with their six branches, and the other scriptures, O king, have been<br>created for the good of him who is of stainless acts.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'All this was said by that high-souled sage unto the<br>ruler of the Videhas, O king, in days of old for his benefit.'"
