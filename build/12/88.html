                            "Yudhishthira said: 'Tell me, O grandsire, how should the king should<br>behave if, notwithstanding his great wealth, he desires for more.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'A king, desirous of earning religious merit, should<br>devote himself to the good of his subjects and protect them according to<br>considerations of place and time and to the best of his intelligence and<br>power. He should, in his dominions, adopt all such measures as would in<br>his estimation secure their good as also his own. A king should milk his<br>kingdom like a bee gathering honey from plants.[253] He should act like<br>the keeper of a cow who draws milk from her without boring her udders and<br>without starving the calf. The king should (in the matter of taxes) act<br>like the leech drawing blood mildly. He should conduct himself towards<br>his subjects like a tigress in the matter of carrying her cubs, touching<br>them with her teeth but never piercing them therewith. He should behave<br>like a mouse which though possessed of sharp and pointed teeth still cuts<br>the feet of sleeping animals in such a manner that they do not at all<br>become conscious of it. A little by little should be taken from a growing<br>subject and by this means should he be shorn. The demand should then be<br>increased gradually till what is taken assumes a fair proportion. The<br>king should enhance the burthens of his subjects gradually like a person<br>gradually increasing the burthens of a young bullock. Acting with care<br>and mildness, he should at last put the reins on them. If the reins are<br>thus put, they would not become intractable. Indeed, adequate measures<br>should be employed for making them obedient. Mere entreaties to reduce<br>them to subjection would not do. It is impossible to behave equally<br>towards all men. Conciliating those that are foremost, the common people<br>should be reduced to obedience. Producing disunion (through the agency of<br>their leaders) among the common people who are to bear the burthens, the<br>king should himself come forward to conciliate them and then enjoy in<br>happiness what he will succeed in drawing from them. The king should<br>never impose taxes unseasonably and on persons unable to bear them. He<br>should impose them gradually and with conciliation, in proper season and<br>according to due forms. These contrivances that I declare unto thee are<br>legitimate means of king-craft. They are not reckoned as methods fraught<br>with deceit. One who seeks to govern steeds by improper methods only<br>makes them furious. Drinking-shops, public women, pimps, actors, gamblers<br>and keepers of gaining houses, and other persons of this kind, who are<br>sources of disorder to the state, should all be checked. Residing within<br>the realm, these afflict and injure the better classes of the subjects.<br>Nobody should ask anything of anyone when there is no distress. Manu<br>himself in days of old has laid down this injunction in respect of all<br>men.[254] If all men were to live by asking or begging and abstain from<br>work, the world would doubtless come to an end. The king alone is<br>competent to restrain and check. That king who does not restrain his<br>subjects (from sin) earns a fourth part of the sins committed by his<br>people (in consequence of the absence of royal protection). This is the<br>declaration of the Srutis. Since the king shares the sins of his subjects<br>like their merits, he should, therefore, O monarch, restrain those<br>subjects of his that are sinful. The king that neglects to restrain them<br>becomes himself sinful. He earns (as already said) a fourth part of their<br>sins as he does a fourth part of their merits. The following faults of<br>which I speak should be checked. They are such as impoverish everyone.<br>What wicked act is there that a person governed by passion would not do?<br>A person governed by passion indulges in stimulants and meat, and<br>appropriates the wives and the wealth of other people, and sets a bad<br>example (for imitation by others). They that do not live upon alms may<br>beg in seasons of distress. The king should, observant of righteousness,<br>make gifts unto them from compassion but not from fear. Let there be no<br>beggars in thy kingdom, nor robbers. It is the robbers (and not virtuous<br>men) that give unto beggars. Such givers are not real benefactors of men.<br>Let such men reside in thy dominions as advance the interests of others<br>and do them good, but not such as exterminate others. Those officers, O<br>king, that take from the subjects more than what is due should be<br>punished. Thou shouldst then appoint others so that these will take only<br>what is due. Agriculture, rearing of cattle, trade and other acts of a<br>similar nature, should be caused to be carried on by many persons on the<br>principle of division of labour.[255] If a person engaged in agriculture,<br>cattle-rearing, or trade, becomes inspired with a sense of insecurity (in<br>consequence of thieves and tyrannical officers), the king, as a<br>consequence, incurs infamy. The king should always honour those subjects<br>of his that are rich and should say unto them, 'Do ye, with me, advance<br>the interest of the people.' In every kingdom, they that are wealthy<br>constitute an estate in the realm. Without doubt, a wealthy person is the<br>foremost of men.[256] He that is wise, or courageous, or wealthy or<br>influential, or righteous, or engaged in penances, or truthful in speech,<br>or gifted with intelligence, assists in protecting (his fellow subjects).<br><br>For these reasons, O monarch, do thou love all creatures, and display the<br>qualities of truth, sincerity, absence of wrath, and abstention from<br>injury! Thou shouldst thus wield the rod of chastisement, and enhance thy<br>treasury and support thy friends and consolidate thy kingdom thus,<br>practising the qualities of truthfulness and sincerity and supported by<br>thy friends, treasury and forces!'"
