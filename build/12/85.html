                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O foremost of kings, what is that method by which a<br>king ruling his subjects may, in consequence of it, obtain great<br>blessedness and eternal fame?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'A king of cleansed soul and attentive to the duty of<br>protecting his subjects earns merit and fame, both here and hereafter, by<br>conducting himself righteously.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'With whom should the king behave in what way? Asked<br>by me, O thou of great wisdom, it behoveth thee to tell me everything<br>duly. Those virtues of which thou hast already spoken with respect to a<br>person, cannot, it is my belief, be found to exist in any single<br>individual.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Thou art endued with great intelligence, O Yudhishthira!<br>It is even so as thou sayest. The person is very rare who is possessed of<br>all those good qualities. To be brief, conduct like this (viz., the<br>presence of all the virtues spoken of), is very difficult to be met with<br>even upon careful search. I shall, however, tell thee what kinds of<br>ministers should be appointed by thee. Four Brahmanas, learned in the<br>Vedas, possessed of a sense of dignity, belonging to the Snataka order,<br>and of pure behaviour, and eight Kshatriyas, all of whom should be<br>possessed of physical strength and capable of wielding weapons, and one<br>and twenty Vaisyas, all of whom should be possessed of wealth, and three<br>Sudras, everyone of whom should be humble and of pure conduct and devoted<br>to his daily duties, and one man of the Suta caste, possessed of a<br>knowledge of the Puranas and the eight cardinal virtues, should be thy<br>ministers. Every one of them should be fifty years of age, possessed of a<br>sense of dignity, free from envy, conversant with the Srutis and the<br>Smritis, humble, impartial, competent to readily decide in the midst of<br>disputants urging different courses of action, free from covetousness,<br>and from the seven dreadful vices called Vyasanas. The king should<br>consult with those eight ministers and hold the lead among them. He<br>should then publish in his kingdom, for the information of his subjects,<br>the results of such deliberation. Thou shouldst always, adopting such a<br>conduct, watch over thy people. Thou shouldst never confiscate what is<br>deposited with thee or appropriate as thine the thing about whose<br>ownership two persons may dispute. Conduct such as this would spoil the<br>administration of justice. If the administration of justice be thus<br>injured, sin will afflict thee, and afflict thy kingdom as well, and<br>inspire thy people with fear as little birds at the sight of the hawk.<br>Thy kingdom will then melt away like a boat wrecked on the sea. If a king<br>governs his subjects with unrighteousness, fear takes possession of his<br>heart and the door of heaven is closed against him. A kingdom, O bull<br>among men, has its root in righteousness. That minister, or king's son,<br>who acts unrighteously, occupying the seat of justice, and those officers<br>who having accepted the charge of affairs, act unjustly, moved by<br>self-interest, all sink in hell along with the king himself. Those<br>helpless men who are oppressed by the powerful and who indulge on that<br>account in piteous and copious lamentations, have their protector in the<br>king. In cases of dispute between two parties the decision should be<br>based upon the evidence of witnesses. If one of the disputants has no<br>witnesses and is helpless, the king should give the case his best<br>consideration. The king should cause chastisement to be meted out to<br>offenders according to the measure of their offences. They that are<br>wealthy should be punished with fines and confiscations; they that are<br>poor, with loss of liberty. Those that are of very wicked conduct should<br>be chastised by the king with even corporal inflictions. The king should<br>cherish all good men with agreeable speeches and gifts of wealth. He who<br>seeks to compass the death of the king should be punished with death to<br>be effected by diverse means. The same should be the punishment of one<br>who becomes guilty of arson or theft or such co-habitation with women as<br>may lead to a confusion of castes. A king, O monarch, who inflicts<br>punishments duly and conformably to the dictates of the science of<br>chastisement, incurs no sin by the act. On the other hand, he earns merit<br>that is eternal. That foolish king who inflicts punishments capriciously,<br>earns infamy here and sinks into hell hereafter. One should not be<br>punished for the fault of another, Reflecting well upon the (criminal)<br>code, a person should be convicted or acquitted. A king should never slay<br>an envoy under any circumstances. That king who slays art envoy sinks<br>into hell with all his ministers. That king observant of Kshatriya<br>practices who slays an envoy that faithfully utters the message with<br>which he is charged, causes the manes of his deceased ancestors to be<br>stained with the sin of killing a foetus. An envoy should possess these<br>seven accomplishments, viz., he should be high-born, of a good family,<br>eloquent, clever, sweet-speeched, faithful in delivering the message with<br>which he is charged, and endued with a good memory. The aid-de-camp of<br>the king that protects his person should be endued with similar<br>qualities. The officer also that guards his capital or citadel should<br>possess the same accomplishments. The king's minister should be<br>conversant with the conclusions of the scriptures and competent in<br>directing wars and making treaties. He should, further, be intelligent,<br>possessed of courage, modest, and capable of keeping secrets. He should<br>also be of high birth endued with strength of mind, and pure in conduct.<br>If possessed of these qualities, he should be regarded worthy. The<br>commander of the king's forces should be possessed of similar<br>accomplishments. He should also be conversant with the different kinds of<br>battle array and with the uses of engines and weapons. He should be able<br>to bear exposure to rain, cold, heat, and wind, and watchful of the<br>laches of foes. The king, O monarch, should be able to lull his foes into<br>a sense of security. He should not, however, himself trust anyone. The<br>reposing of confidence on even his own son is not to be approved of. I<br>have now, O sinless one, declared to thee what the conclusions of the<br>scriptures are. Refusal to trust anyone has been said to be one of the<br>highest mysteries of king-craft.'"
