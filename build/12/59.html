                            Vaisampayana said, "Rising from their beds the next day and performing<br>the morning rites laid down in the scriptures, the Pandavas and the<br>Yadavas set out (for the spot where Bhishma lay) on their cars resembling<br>fortified towns. Proceeding to the field of Kuru and approaching the<br>sinless Bhishma, they enquired of that foremost of car-warriors if he had<br>passed the night happily. Saluting all the Rishis, and blessed by them in<br>return, the princes took their seats around Bhishma. Then king<br>Yudhishthira the just possessed of great energy, having worshipped<br>Bhishma duly, said these words with joined hands.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Whence arose the word Rajan (King), that is used, O<br>Bharata, on earth? Tell me this, O scorcher of foes! Possessed of hands<br>and arms and neck like others, having understanding and senses like those<br>of others, subject like others to the same kinds of joy and grief, endued<br>with back, mouth, and stomach similar to those of the rest of the world,<br>having vital fluids and bones and marrow and flesh and blood similar to<br>those of, the rest of the world, inhaling and exhaling breaths like<br>others, possessed of life-breaths and bodies like other men, resembling<br>others in birth and death, in fact, similar to others in respect of all<br>attributes of humanity, for what reason does one man, viz., the king,<br>govern the rest of the world numbering many men possessed of great<br>intelligence and bravery? Whence is it that one man rules the wide world<br>teeming with brave and energetic and high-born men of good behaviour? Why<br>do all men seek to obtain his favour? Why is it that if one man becomes<br>delighted, the whole world becomes delighted, and if that one man is<br>troubled, the whole world becomes troubled? I desire to hear this in<br>detail, O bull of Bharata's race! O foremost of speakers, discourse to me<br>on this fully. O king, there cannot but be a grave reason for all this<br>since it is seen that the whole world bows down to one man as to a god.<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'With concentrated attention, O tiger among kings, listen<br>to it in detail as to how in the Krita age sovereignty first began. At<br>first there was no sovereignty, no king, no chastisement, and no<br>chastiser. All men used to protect one another righteously. As they thus<br>lived, O Bharata, righteously protecting one another, they found the task<br>(after some time) to be painful. Error then began to assail their hearts.<br>Having become subject to error, the perceptions of men, O prince, came to<br>be clouded, and thence their virtue began to decline. When their<br>perceptions were dimmed and when men became subject to error, all of them<br>became covetous. O chief of the Bharatas! And because men sought to<br>obtain objects, which they did not possess, another passion called lust<br>(of acquisition) got hold of them. When they became subject to lust,<br>another passion, named anger, soon soiled them. Once subject to wrath,<br>they lost all consideration of what should be done and what should not.<br>Unrestrained sexual indulgence set in. Men began to utter what they<br>chose. All distinctions between food that is clean and unclean and<br>between virtue and vice disappeared. When this confusion set in amongst<br>men, the Vedas disappeared. Upon the disappearance of the Vedas,<br>Righteousness was lost. When both the Vedas and righteousness were lost,<br>the gods were possessed by fear. Overcome with fear, O tiger among men,<br>they sought the protection of Brahmana. Having gratified the divine<br>Grandsire of the universe, the gods, afflicted with grief, said unto him,<br>with joined hands, 'O god, the eternal Vedas have been afflicted in the<br>world of men by covetousness and error. For this, we have been struck<br>with fear. Through loss of the Vedas, O Supreme Lord, righteousness also<br>has been lost. For this, O Lord of the three worlds, we are about to<br>descend to the level of human beings. Men used to pour libations upwards<br>while we used to pour rain downwards.[170] In consequence, however, of<br>the cessation of all pious rites among men, great distress will be our<br>lot. Do thou then, O Grandsire, think of that which would benefit us, so<br>that the universe, created by thy power, may not meet with destruction.'<br>Thus addressed, the Self-born and divine Lord said unto them, 'I shall<br>think of what will do good to all. Ye foremost of gods, let your fears be<br>dispelled!' The Grandsire then composed by his own intelligence a<br>treatise consisting of a hundred thousand chapters. In it were treated<br>the subject of Virtue, Profit, and Pleasure. Which the Self-born<br>designated as the triple aggregate. He treated of a fourth subject called<br>Emancipation with opposite meaning and attributes. The triple aggregate<br>in respect of emancipation, viz., to the attributes of Goodness, Passion,<br>and Darkness, and another, (a fourth, viz., the practice of duty without<br>hope of bliss or reward in this or the other world), were treated in it.<br>Another triple aggregate connected with Chastisement, viz., Conversation,<br>Growth, and Destruction, was treated in it.[171] Another aggregate of six<br>consisting of the hearts of men, place, time, means, overt acts, and<br>alliances, and causes, were treated in it. The religious rites laid down<br>in the three Vedas, knowledge, and the acts necessary for the support of<br>life, (viz., agriculture, trade, &c.), O bull of Bharata's race, and the<br>very extensive branch of learning called punitive legislation, were laid<br>down in it. The subjects also of behaviour towards counsellors, of spies,<br>the indications of princes, of secret agents possessed of diverse means,<br>of envoys and agents of other kinds, conciliation, fomenting discord,<br>gifts, and chastisement, O king, with toleration as the fifth, were fully<br>treated therein. Deliberation of all kinds, counsels for producing<br>disunion, the errors of deliberation, the results of the success or<br>failure of counsels, treaties of three kinds, viz., bad, middling, and<br>good, made through fear, good offices, and gifts of wealth, were<br>described in detail. The four kinds of time for making journeys, the<br>details of the aggregate of three, the three kinds of victory, viz., that<br>secured righteously, that won by wealth, and that obtained by deceitful<br>ways, were described in detail. The three kinds of attributes, viz., bad,<br>middling, and good, of the aggregate of five (viz., counsellors, kingdom,<br>fort, army, and treasury,) were also treated in it. Chastisements of two<br>kinds, viz., open and secret, were indicated. The eight kinds of open<br>chastisement, as also the eight kinds of secret chastisement, were dealt<br>with in detail. Cars, elephants, horses, and foot-soldiers, O son of<br>Pandu, impressed labourers, crews, and paid attendants (of armies), and<br>guides taken from the country which is the seat of war, these are the<br>eight instruments, O Kauravya, of open chastisement or forces acting<br>openly. The use and administration of movable and immovable poison were<br>also mentioned in respect of the three kinds of things, viz., wearing<br>apparel, food, and incantations. Enemies, allies, and neutrals,&#8212;these<br>also were described. The diverse characteristics of roads (to be taken,<br>as dependent on stars and planets, etc.), the attributes of the soil (on<br>which to encamp), protection of self, superintendence of the construction<br>of cars and other utensils of war and use, the diverse means for<br>protecting and improving men, elephants, cars, and steeds, the diverse<br>kinds of battle array, strategies, and manoeuvres in war, planetary<br>conjunctions foreboding evil, calamitous visitations (such as<br>earthquakes), skilful methods of warfare and retreat, knowledge of<br>weapons and their proper keep, the disorders of troops and how to get rid<br>of them, the means of inspiring the army with joy and confidence,<br>diseases, times of distress and danger, knowledge of guiding<br>foot-soldiers in battle, the methods of sounding alarms and notifying<br>orders, inspiring the enemy with fear by display of standards, the<br>diverse methods of afflicting the enemy's kingdom by means of robbers and<br>fierce wild-tribes, and fire-raisers and poisoners and forgers by<br>producing disunion among the chief officers of hostile armies, by cutting<br>down crops and plants, by destroying the efficiency of the enemy's<br>elephants, by producing alarms, by honouring those among the enemy's<br>subjects that are well disposed towards the invader, and by inspiring the<br>enemy with confidence, the waste, growth, and harmony of the seven<br>essential requisites of sovereignty, capacity for (projected) works, the<br>means for accomplishing them, the methods of extending the kingdom, the<br>means of winning over persons residing in the enemy's territory, the<br>chastisement and destruction of those that are strong, the exact<br>administration of justice, the extermination of the wicked, wrestling,<br>shooting and throwing and hurling of weapons, the methods of making<br>presents and of storing requisite things, feeding the unfed and<br>supervision over those that have been fed, gifts of wealth in season,<br>freedom from the vices called Vyasanas, the attributes of kings, the<br>qualifications of military officers, the sources of the aggregate of<br>three and its merits and faults, the diverse kinds of evil intents, the<br>behaviour of dependents, suspicion against every one, the avoidance of<br>heedlessness, the acquisition of objects unattained, the improving of<br>objects already acquired, gifts to deserving persons of what has thus<br>been improved, expenditure of wealth for pious purposes, for acquiring<br>objects of desire, and for dispelling danger and distress, were all<br>treated in that work. The fierce vices, O chief of the Kurus, born of<br>temper, and those born of lust, in all of ten kinds, were mentioned in<br>that treatise. The four kinds of vices which the learned say are born of<br>lust, viz., hunting, gambling, drinking, and sexual indulgence, were<br>mentioned by the Self-born in that work. Rudeness of speech, fierceness,<br>severity of chastisement, infliction of pain on the body, suicide, and<br>frustrating one's own objects, these are the six kinds of faults born of<br>wrath, that have also been mentioned. Diverse kinds of machines and their<br>actions have been described there. Devastation of the enemy's<br>territories, attacks upon foes, the destruction and removal of landmarks<br>and other indications, the cutting down of large trees (for depriving the<br>enemy and the enemy's subjects of their refreshing shade), siege of<br>forts, supervision of agriculture and other useful operations, the<br>storage of necessaries, robes and attire (of troops), and the best means<br>of manufacturing them, were all described. The characteristics and uses<br>of Panavas, Anakas, conchs, and drums. O Yudhishthira, the six kinds of<br>articles (viz., gems, animals, lands, robes, female slaves, and gold) and<br>the means of acquiring them (for one's one self) and of destroying them<br>(for injuring the foe), pacification of newly acquired territories,<br>honouring the good, cultivating friendship with the learned, knowledge of<br>the rules in respect of gifts and religious rites such as homa, the touch<br>of auspicious articles, attention to the adornment of the body, the<br>manner of preparing and using food, piety of behaviour, the attainment of<br>prosperity by following in one path, truthfulness of speech, sweetness of<br>speech, observance of acts done on occasions of festivity and social<br>gatherings and those done within the household, the open and secret acts<br>of persons in all places of meeting, the constant supervision of the<br>behaviour of men, the immunity of Brahmanas from punishment, the<br>reasonable infliction of punishment, honours paid to dependants in<br>consideration of kinship and merit, the protection of subjects and the<br>means of extending the kingdom, the counsels that a king who lives in the<br>midst of a dozen of kings, should pursue in respect of the four kinds of<br>foes, the four kinds of allies, and the four kinds of neutrals, the two<br>and seventy acts laid down in medical works about the protection,<br>exercise, and improvements of the body, and the practices of particular<br>countries, tribes, and families, were all duty treated in that work.<br>Virtue, Profit, and Pleasure, and Emancipation, were also described in<br>it. The diverse means of acquisition, the desire for diverse kinds of<br>wealth. O giver of profuse presents, the methods of agriculture and other<br>operations that form the chief source of the revenue, and the various<br>means for producing and applying illusions, the methods by which stagnant<br>water is rendered foul, were laid down in it. All those means, O tiger<br>among kings, by which men might be prevented from deviating from the path<br>of righteousness and honesty, were all described in it. Having composed<br>that highly beneficial treatise, the divine Lord cheerfully said unto the<br>deities having Indra for their head, those words: 'For the good of the<br>world and for establishing the triple aggregate (viz., Virtue, Profit,<br>and Pleasure), I have composed this science representing the very cheese<br>of speech. Assisted by chastisement, this science will protect the world.<br>Dealing rewards and punishments, this science will operate among men. And<br>because men are led (to the acquisition of the objects of their<br>existence) by chastisement, or, in other words, chastisement leads or<br>governs everything, therefore will this science be known in the three<br>worlds as Dandaniti (science of chastisement).[172] Containing the<br>essence of all the attributes of the aggregate of six, this science will<br>always be much regarded by all high-souled persons. Virtue, Profit,<br>Pleasure, and Salvation have all been treated in it.' After this, the<br>lord of Uma,&#8212;the divine and multiform Siva of large eyes, the Source of<br>all blessings, first studied and mastered it. In view, however, of the<br>gradual decrease of the period of life of human beings, the divine Siva<br>abridged that science of grave import compiled by Brahman. The<br>abridgment, called Vaisalakasha, consisting of ten thousand lessons, was<br>then received by Indra devoted to Brahman and endued with great ascetic<br>merit. The divine Indra also abridged it into a treatise consisting of<br>five thousand lessons and called it Vahudantaka. Afterwards the puissant<br>Vrihaspati, by his intelligence, further abridged the work into a<br>treatise consisting of three thousand lessons and called it Varhaspatya.<br>Next, that preceptor of Yoga, of great celebrity, viz., Kavi of<br>immeasurable wisdom, reduced it further into a work of a thousand<br>lessons. In view of the period of men's lives and the general decrease<br>(of everything), great Rishis did thus, for benefiting the world, abridge<br>that science. The gods then, approaching that lord of creatures, viz.,<br>Vishnu, said unto him, 'Indicate, O god, that one among mortals who<br>deserves to have superiority over the rest.' The divine and puissant<br>Narayana, reflecting a little, created, by a fiat of his will, a son born<br>of his energy, named Virajas. The highly blessed Virajas, however, did<br>not desire sovereignty on earth. His mind, O son of Pandu, inclined to a<br>life of renunciation. Virajas had a son named Krittimat. He too renounced<br>pleasure and enjoyment.[173] Krittimat had a son named Kardama. Kardama<br>also practised severe austerities. The lord of creatures, Kardama, begot<br>a son named Ananga. Ananga became a protector of creatures, pious in<br>behaviour, and fully conversant with the science of chastisement. Ananga<br>begot a son named Ativala, well versed in policy. Obtaining extensive<br>empire after the demise of his sire, he became a slave of his passions.<br>Mrityu, O king, had a daughter born of his mind, named Sunita and<br>celebrated over the three worlds. She was married to Ativala and gave<br>birth to a son named Vena. Vena, a slave of wrath and malice, became<br>unrighteous in his conduct towards all creatures. The Rishis, those<br>utterers of Brahma, slew him with Kusa blades (as their weapon) inspired<br>with mantras. Uttering mantras the while, those Rishis pierced the right<br>thigh of Vena. Thereupon, from that thigh, came out a short-limbed person<br>on earth, resembling a charred brand, with blood-red eyes and black hair.<br>Those utterers of Brahma said unto him, 'Nishida (sit) here!' From him<br>have sprung the Nishadas, viz., those wicked tribes that have the hills<br>and the forests for their abode, as also those hundreds and thousands of<br>others called Mlechchhas, residing on the Vindhya mountains. The great<br>Rishis then pierced the right arm of Vena. Thence sprang a person who was<br>a second Indra in form. Clad in mail, armed with scimitars, bows, and<br>arrows, and well-versed in the science of weapons, he was fully<br>acquainted with the Vedas and their branches. All the ordinances of the<br>science of chastisement, O king, (in their embodied forms) came to that<br>best of men. The son of Vena then, with joined hands, said unto those<br>great Rishis, 'I have attained an understanding that is very keen and<br>that is observant of righteousness. Tell me in detail what I shall do<br>with it. That useful task which you will be pleased to indicate, I shall<br>accomplish without hesitation.' Thus addressed, the gods that were<br>present there, as also the Rishis, said unto him. 'Do thou fearlessly<br>accomplish all those tasks in which righteousness even resides.<br>Disregarding what is dear and what not so, look upon all creatures with<br>an equal eye. Castoff at a distance Just and wrath and covetousness and<br>honour, and, always observing the dictates of righteousness, do thou<br>punish with thy own hands the man, whoever he may be, that deviates from<br>the path of duty. Do thou also swear that thou wouldst, in thought, word,<br>and deed, always maintain the religion inculcated on earth by the Vedas.<br>Do thou further swear that thou wouldst fearlessly maintain the duties<br>laid down in the Vedas with the aid of the science of chastisement, and<br>that thou wouldst never act with caprice. O puissant one, know that<br>Brahmanas are exempt from chastisement, and pledge further that thou<br>wouldst protect the world from an intermixture of castes.' Thus<br>addressed, Vena's son replied unto the deities headed by the Rishis,<br>saying, 'Those bulls among men, viz., the highly blessed Brahmanas, shall<br>ever be worshipped by me.' Those utterers of Brahma then said unto him,<br>'Let it be so!' Then Sukra, that vast receptacle of Brahma, became his<br>priest. The Valakhilyas became his counsellors, and the Saraswatas his<br>companions. The great and illustrious Rishi Garga became his astrologer.<br>This high declaration of the Srutis is current among men that Prithu is<br>the eighth from Vishnu. A little before, the two persons named Suta and<br>Magadha had come into existence. They became his bards and panegyrists.<br>Gratified, Prithu, the royal son of Vena, possessed of great prowess,<br>gave unto Suta the land lying on the sea-coast, and unto Magadha the<br>country since known as Magadha. We have heard that the surface of the<br>earth had before been very uneven. It was Prithu who made the terrestrial<br>surface level. In every Manwantara, the earth becomes uneven.[174] Vena's<br>son removed the rocks and rocky masses lying all around, O monarch, with<br>the horn of his bow. By this means the hills and mountains became<br>enlarged. Then Vishnu, and the deities of Indra, and the Rishis, and the<br>Regents of the world, and the Brahmanas, assembled together for crowning<br>Prithu (as the king of the world). The earth herself, O son of Pandu, in<br>her embodied form, came to him, with a tribute of gems and jewels. Ocean,<br>that lord of rivers, and Himavat, the king of mountains, and Sakra, O<br>Yudhishthira, bestowed upon him inexhaustible wealth. The great Meru,<br>that mountain of gold, gave unto him heaps of that precious metal. The<br>divine Kuvera, borne on the shoulders of human beings, that lord of<br>Yakshas and Rakshasas, gave him wealth enough for gratifying the needs of<br>religion, profit, and pleasure. Steeds, cars, elephants, and men, by<br>millions, O son of Pandu, started into life as soon as Vena's son thought<br>of them. At that time there was neither decrepitude, nor famine, nor<br>calamity, nor disease (on earth). In consequence of the protection<br>afforded by that king, nobody had any fear from reptiles and thieves or<br>from any other source. When he proceeded to the sea, the waters used to<br>be solidified. The mountains gave him way, and his standard was never<br>obstructed anywhere. He drew from the earth, as a milcher from a cow,<br>seven and ten kinds of crops for the food of Yakshas, and Rakshasas, and<br>Nagas, and other creatures. That high-souled king caused all creatures to<br>regard righteousness as the foremost of all things; and because he<br>gratified all the people, therefore, was he called Rajan (king). And<br>because he also healed the wounds of Brahmanas, therefore, he earned the<br>name of Kshatriya. And because the earth (in his region) became<br>celebrated for the practice of virtue, therefore, she came to be called<br>by many as Prithvi. The eternal Vishnu himself, O Bharata, confirmed his<br>power, telling him, 'No one, O king, shall transcend thee.' The divine<br>Vishnu entered the body of that monarch in consequence of his penances.<br>For this reason, the entire universe offered divine worship unto Prithu,<br>numbered among human gods.[175] O king, thy kingdom should always be<br>protected by the aid of the science of chastisement. Thou shouldst also,<br>by careful observation made through the movements of thy spies, protect<br>it in such a way that no one may be able to injure it.[176] All good<br>acts, O king, lead to the good (of the monarch). The conduct of a king<br>should be regulated by his own intelligence, as also by the opportunities<br>and means that may offer themselves.[177] What other cause is there in<br>consequence of which the multitude live in obedience to one, save the<br>divinity of the monarch? At that time a golden lotus was born from<br>Vishnu's brow. The goddess Sree was born of that lotus. She became the<br>spouse of Dharma of great intelligence upon Sree, O son of Pandu, Dharma<br>begot Artha. All the three, viz., Dharma, and Artha and Sree, were<br>established in sovereignty. A person upon the exhaustion of his merit,<br>comes down from heaven to earth, and takes birth as a king conversant<br>with the science of chastisement. Such a person becomes endued with<br>greatness and is really a portion of Vishnu on earth. He becomes<br>possessed of great intelligence and obtains superiority over others.<br>Established by the gods, no one transcends him. It is for this reason<br>that everybody acts in obedience to one, and it is for this that the<br>world cannot command him. Good acts, O king, lead to good. It is for this<br>that the multitude obey his words of command, though he belongs to the<br>same world and is possessed of similar limbs. He who once beheld Prithu's<br>amiable face became obedient to him. Thenceforth he began to regard him<br>as handsome, wealthy, and highly blessed.[178] In consequence of the<br>might of his sceptre, the practice of morality and just behaviour became<br>so visible on earth. It is through that reason that the earth became<br>overspread with virtue.'<br><br>"Thus, O Yudhishthira, the histories of all past events, the origin of<br>the great Rishis, the holy waters, the planets and stars and asterisms,<br>the duties in respect of the four modes of life, the four kinds of Homa,<br>the characteristics of the four orders of men, and the four branches of<br>learning, were all treated of in that work (of the Grandsire). Whatever<br>objects or things, O son of Pandu, there are on earth, were all included<br>in that treatise of the Grandsire. Histories and the Vedas and the<br>science of Nyaya were all treated in it, as also penances, knowledge,<br>abstention from injury in respect of all creatures, truth, falsehood, and<br>high morality. Worship of persons old in years, gifts, purity of<br>behaviour, readiness for exertion, and compassion towards all creatures,<br>were very fully described in it. There is no doubt in this. Since that<br>time, O monarch, the learned have begun to say that there is no<br>difference between a god and a king. I have now told thee everything<br>about the greatness of kings. What other subject is there, O chief of the<br>Bharatas, upon which I shall next have to discourse?"
