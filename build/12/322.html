                            "Yudhishthira said, 'How was Suka, the son of Vyasa, in days of old, won<br>over to Renunciation? I desire to hear thee recite the story. My<br>curiosity in this respect is irrepressible. It behoveth thee, O thou of<br>Kuru's race, to discourse to me on the conclusions in respect of the<br>Unmanifest (Cause), the Manifest (Effects), and of the Truth (or Brahma)<br>that is in, but unattached to them, as also of the acts of the self-born<br>Narayana, as they are known to thy understanding.<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Beholding his son Suka living fearlessly as ordinary men<br>do in practices that are considered harmless by them, Vyasa taught him<br>the entire Vedas and then discoursed to him one day in these words:<br>'Vyasa said, O son, becoming the master of the senses, do thou subdue<br>extreme cold and extreme heat, hunger and thirst, and the wind also, and<br>having subdued them (as Yogins do), do thou practise righteousness. Do<br>thou duly observe truth and sincerity, and freedom from wrath and malice,<br>and self-restraint and penances, and the duties of benevolence and<br>compassion. Rest thou on truth, firmly devoted to righteousness,<br>abandoning all sort of insincerity and deceit. Do thou support thy life<br>on what remains of food after feeding gods and guests. Thy body is as<br>transitory as the froth on the surface of water. The Jiva-soul is sitting<br>unattached in it as a bird on a tree. The companionship of all agreeable<br>object is exceedingly short-lived. Why then, O son, dost thou sleep in<br>such forgetfulness? Thy foes are heedful and awake and ever ready (to<br>spring on thee) and always watchful of their opportunity. Why art thou so<br>foolish as not to know this?[1712] As the days are going one after<br>another, the period of thy life is being lessened. Indeed when thy life<br>is being incessantly shortened, why dost thou not run to preceptors (for<br>learning the means of rescue)? Only they that are destitute of faith (in<br>the existence of next life) set their hearts on things of this world that<br>have the only effect of increasing flesh and blood. They are totally<br>unmindful of all that is concerned with the next world. Those men that<br>are stupefied by erroneous understandings display a hatred for<br>righteousness. The man who walks after those misguided persons that have<br>betaken themselves to devious and wrong paths is afflicted equally with<br>them. They however, that are contented, devoted to the scriptures, endued<br>with high souls, and possessed of great might, betake themselves to the<br>part of righteousness. Do thou wait upon them with reverence and seek<br>instruction from them. Do thou act according to the instructions received<br>from those wise men whose eyes are set upon righteousness. With<br>understanding cleansed by such lessons and rendered superior, do thou<br>then restrain thy heart which is ever ready to deviate from the right<br>course. They whose understandings are always concerned with the present,<br>who fearlessly regard the tomorrow as something quite remote,&#8212;they who<br>do not observe any restrictions in the matter of food,&#8212;ate really<br>senseless persons that fail to understand that this world is only a field<br>of probation.[1713] Repairing to the fight of steps constituted by<br>Righteousness, do thou ascend those steps one after another. At present<br>thou art like a worm that is employed in weaving its cocoon round itself<br>and thereby depriving itself of all means of escape. Do thou keep to thy<br>left, without any scruple, the atheist who transgresses all restraints,<br>who is situated like a house by the side of a fierce and encroaching<br>current, (for the destruction he courts), and who (to others) seems to<br>stand like a bamboo with its tall head erected in pride.[1714] Do thou<br>with the raft of Yoga, cross the ocean of the world whose waters are<br>constituted by thy five senses. Having Desire and Wrath and Death for its<br>fierce monsters, and owning birth for its vortex. Do thou cross, with the<br>raft of Righteousness, the world that is affected by Death and afflicted<br>by Decrepitude, and upon which the thunder-bolts constituted by days and<br>nights are falling incessantly. When death is seeking thee at all<br>moments, viz., when thou art sitting or lying down, it is certain that<br>Death may get thee for his victim at any time. Whence art thou to obtain<br>thy rescue! Like the she-wolf snatching away a lamb. Death snatches away<br>one that is still engaged in earning wealth and still unsatisfied in the<br>indulgence of his pleasures. When thou art destined to enter into the<br>dark, do thou hold up the blazing lamp made of righteous understanding<br>and whose flame has been well-husbanded out. Failing into various forms<br>one after another in the world of men, a creature obtains the status of<br>Brahmanhood with great difficulty. Thou hast obtained that status. Do<br>thou then, O son endeavour to maintain it (properly).[1715] A Brahman<br>hath not been born for the gratification of desire. On the other hand,<br>his body is intended to be subjected to mortification and penances in<br>this world so that incomparable happiness may be his in the next world.<br>The status of Brahmanhood is acquired with the aid of long-continued and<br>austere penances. Having acquired that status, one should never waste<br>one's time in the indulgence of one's senses. Always engaged in penances<br>and self-restraint and desirous of what is for thy good, do thou live and<br>act, devoted to peace and tranquillity. The period of life, of every man,<br>is like a steed. The nature of that steed is unmanifest. The (sixteen)<br>elements (mentioned before) constitute its body. Its nature is<br>exceedingly subtile. Kshanas, and Trutis, and Nimeshas are the hair on<br>its body. The twilights constitute its shoulder joints; The lighted and<br>the dark fortnights are its two eyes of equal power. Months are its other<br>limbs. That steed is running incessantly. If thy eyes be not blind,<br>beholding then that steed incessantly moving forward in its invisible<br>course, do thou set thy heart on righteousness, after hearing what thy<br>preceptors have to say on the question of the next world. They that fall<br>away from righteousness and that conduct themselves recklessly, that<br>always display malice towards others and betake themselves to evil ways<br>are obliged to assume (physical) bodies in the regions of Yama and suffer<br>diverse afflictions, in consequence of their unrighteous acts of diverse<br>kind.[1716] That king who is devoted to righteousness and who protects<br>and chastises the good and the wicked with discrimination, attains to<br>those regions that belong to man of righteous deeds. By doing diverse<br>kinds of good acts, he attains to such felicity as is faultless and as is<br>incapable of being attained to by undergoing even thousands of<br>births.[1717] Furious dogs of frightful mien, crows of iron beaks, flocks<br>of ravens and vultures and other birds, and blood-sucking worms, assail<br>the man who transgresses the commands of his parents and preceptors when<br>he goes to hell after death.[1718] That sinful wretch who, in consequence<br>of his recklessness, transgresses the ten boundaries that have been fixed<br>by the Self-born himself, is obliged to pass his time in great affliction<br>in the wild wastes that occur in the dominions of the king of<br>Pitris.[1719] That man who is tainted with cupidity, who is in love with<br>untruth, who always takes a delight in deception and cheating, and who<br>does injuries to others by practising hypocrisy and deception, has to go<br>to deep hell and suffer great woe and affliction for his acts of<br>wickedness. Such a man is forced to bathe in the broad river called<br>Vaitarani whose waters are scalding, to enter into a forest of trees<br>whose leaves are as sharp as swords, and then to lie down on a bed of<br>battle-axes. He has thus to pass his days in frightful hell in great<br>affliction. Thou beholdest only the regions of Brahman and other deities,<br>but thou art blind to that which is the highest (viz., Emancipation).<br>Alas, thou art ever blind also to that which brings Death on its train<br>(viz., decrepitude and old age).[1720] Go (along the path of<br>Emancipation)! Why tarriest thou? A frightful terror, destructive of thy<br>happiness, is before thee! Do thou take prompt steps for achieving thy<br>Emancipation! Soon after death thou art sure to be taken before Yama at<br>his command. For obtaining felicity in the next world, strive to attain<br>to righteousness through the practice of difficult and austere vows. The<br>puissant Yama, regardless of the sufferings of others, very soon takes<br>the lives of all persons, that is of thyself and thy friends. There is<br>none capable of resisting him. Very soon the wind of Yama will blow<br>before thee (and drive thee to his presence). Very soon wilt thou be<br>taken to that dread presence all alone. Do thou achieve what will be for<br>thy good there. Where now is that Death-wind which will blow before thee<br>very soon? (Art thou mindful of it?) Very soon will the points of the<br>compass, when that moment arrives, begin to whirl before thy eyes. (Art<br>thou mindful of that?) O son, soon (when that moment comes) will thy<br>Vedas disappear from thy sight as thou goest helplessly into that dread<br>presence. Do thou, therefore, set thy heart on Yoga abstraction which is<br>possessed of great excellence.[1721] Do thou seek to attain that one only<br>treasure so that thou mayst not have to grieve at the recollection (after<br>Death) of thy former deeds good and bad all of which are characterised by<br>error.[1722] Decrepitude very soon weakens thy body and robs thee of thy<br>strength and limbs and beauty. Do thou, therefore, seek that one only<br>treasure. Very soon the Destroyer, with Disease for his charioteer, will<br>with a strong hand, for taking thy life, pierce and break thy body. Do<br>thou, therefore practise austere penance. Very soon will, those terrible<br>wolves that reside within thy body, assail thee from every side. Do thou<br>endeavour, therefore, to achieve acts of righteousness.[1723] Very soon<br>wilt thou, all alone, behold a thick darkness, and very soon wilt thou<br>behold golden trees on the top of the hill. Do thou, therefore, hasten to<br>achieve acts of righteousness.[1724] Very soon will those evil companions<br>and foes of thine, (viz., the senses), dressed in the guise of friends,<br>swerve thee from correct vision. Do thou, then, O son, strive to achieve<br>that which is of the highest good. Do thou earn that wealth which has no<br>fear from either kings or thieves, and which one has not to abandon even<br>at Death. Earned by one's own acts, that wealth has never to be divided<br>among co-owners. Each enjoys that wealth (in the other world) which each<br>has earned for himself. O son, give that to others by which they may be<br>able to live in the next world. Do thou also set thyself to the<br>acquisition of that wealth which is indestructible and durable. Do not<br>think that thou shouldst first enjoy all kinds of pleasures and then turn<br>thy heart on Emancipation, for before thou art satiated with enjoyment<br>thou mayst be overtaken by Death. Do thou, in view of this, hasten to do<br>acts of goodness.[1725] Neither mother, nor son, nor relatives, nor dear<br>friends even when solicited with honours, accompany the man that dies. To<br>the regions of Yama one has to go oneself, unaccompanied by any one. Only<br>those deeds, good and bad, that one did before death accompany the man<br>that goes to the other world. The gold and gems that one has earned by<br>good and bad means do not become productive of any benefit to one when<br>one's body meets with dissolution. Of men that have gone to the other<br>world, there is no witness, better than the soul, of all act done or<br>undone in life. That when the acting-Chaitanya (Jiva-soul) enters into<br>the witness-Chaitanya the destruction of the body takes place, is seen by<br>Yoga-intelligence when Yogins enter the firmament of their hearts.[1726]<br>Even here, the god of Fire, the Sun and the Wind,&#8212;these three reside in<br>the body. These, beholding as they do all the practices of one's life<br>become one's witnesses. Days and Nights,&#8212;the former characterised by the<br>virtue of displaying all things and the latter characterised by the<br>virtue of concealing all things,&#8212;are running incessantly and touching<br>all things (and thereby lessening their allotted periods of existence).<br>Do thou, therefore, be observant of the duties of thy own order.[1727]<br>The road in the other world (that leads to the regions of Yama), is<br>infested by many foes (in the form of iron-beaked birds and wolves) and<br>by many repulsive and terrible insects and worms. Do thou take care of<br>thy own acts, for only acts will accompany you along that road. These one<br>has not to share one's acts with others, but every one enjoys or endures<br>the fruits of those acts which every one has himself performed. As<br>Apsaras and great Rishis attain to fruits of great felicity, after the<br>same manner, men of righteous deeds, as the fruits of their respective<br>righteous acts, obtain in the other world cars of transcendent brightness<br>that move everywhere at the will of the riders. Men of stainless deeds<br>and cleansed souls and pure birth obtain in the next world fruits that<br>correspond with their own righteous acts in this life. By walking along<br>the high road constituted by the duties of domesticity, men acquire happy<br>ends by attaining to the region of Prajapati or Vrihaspati or of him of a<br>hundred sacrifices. I can give thee thousands and thousands of<br>instructions. Know, however, that the puissant cleanser (viz.,<br>Righteousness), keeps all foolish persons in the Dark.[1728] Thou hast<br>passed four and twenty years. Thou art now full five and twenty years of<br>age. Thy years are passing away. Do thou beg in to lay thy store of<br>righteousness. The Destroyer that dwells within error and heedlessness<br>will very soon deprive thy senses of their respective powers. Do thou<br>before that consummation is brought about, hasten to observe thy duties,<br>relying on thy body alone.[1729] When it is thy duty to go along that<br>road in which thyself only shalt be in front and thyself only in the<br>rear, what need then hast thou with either thy body or thy spouse and<br>children?[1730] When men have to go individually and without companions<br>to the region of Yama, it is plain that in view of such a situation of<br>terror, thou shouldst seek to acquire that one only treasure (viz.,<br>Righteousness or Yogasamadhi). The puissant Yama, regardless of the<br>afflictions of others, snatches, away the friends and relatives of one's<br>race by the very roots. There is no one that can resist him. Do thou,<br>therefore, seek to acquire a stock of righteousness I impart to thee<br>these lessons, O son, that are all agreeable with the scriptures I<br>follow. Do thou observe them by acting according to their import. He who<br>supports his body by following the duties laid down for his own order,<br>and who makes gifts for earning whatever fruits may attach to such acts,<br>becomes freed from the consequences that are born of ignorance and<br>error.[1731] The knowledge which a man of righteous deeds acquires from<br>Vedic declarations leads to omniscience. That omniscience is identical<br>with the science of the highest object of human acquisition (viz.,<br>Emancipation). Instruction, imparted to the grateful, became beneficial<br>(in consequence of their leading to the attainment of that highest object<br>of human acquisition).[1732] The pleasure that one takes in living amidst<br>the habitations of men is truly a fast-binding cord. Breaking that cord,<br>men of righteous deeds repair to regions of great felicity. Wicked men,<br>however, fail to break that bond. What use hast thou of wealth, O son, or<br>with relatives, or with children, since thou hast to die: Do thou employ<br>thyself in seeking for thy soul which is hidden in a cave. Where have all<br>thy grandsires gone? Do that today which thou wouldst keep for tomorrow.<br>Do that in the forenoon which thou wouldst keep for the afternoon. Death<br>does not wait for any one, to see whether one has or has not accomplished<br>one's task. Following the body after one's death (to the crematorium),<br>one's relatives and kinsmen and friends come back, throwing it on the<br>funeral pyre. Without a scruple do thou avoid those men that are<br>sceptics, that are destitute of compassion, and that are devoted to<br>wicked ways, and do thou endeavour to seek, without listlessness or<br>apathy, that which is for thy highest good. When, therefore, the world is<br>thus afflicted by Death, do thou, with thy whole heart, achieve<br>righteousness, aided all the while by unswerving patience. That man who<br>is well conversant with the means of attaining to Emancipation and who<br>duly discharges the duties of his order, certainly attains to great<br>felicity in the other world. For thee that dost not recognise death in<br>the attainment of a different body and that dost not deviate from the<br>path trod by the righteous, there is no destruction. He that increases<br>the stock of righteousness is truly wise. He, on the other hand, that<br>falls away from righteousness is said to be a fool. One that is engaged<br>in the accomplishment of good deeds attains to heaven and other rewards<br>as the fruits of those deeds; but he that is devoted to wicked deeds has<br>to sink in hell. Having acquired the status of humanity, so difficult of<br>acquisition, that is the stepping-stone to heaven, one should fix one's<br>soul on Brahma so that one may not fall away once more. That man whose<br>understanding, directed to the path of heaven, does not deviate<br>therefrom, is regarded by the wise as truly a man of righteousness and<br>when he dies his friends should indulge in grief. That man whose<br>understanding is not restless and which is directed to Brahma and who has<br>attained to heaven, becomes freed from a great terror (viz., hell). They<br>that are born in retreats of ascetics and that die there, do not earn<br>much merit by abstaining all their life from enjoyments and the<br>indulgence of desire. He, however, who though possessed of objects of<br>enjoyment casts them off and engages himself in the practice of penances,<br>succeeds in acquiring everything. The fruits of the penances of such a<br>man are, I think, much higher. Mothers and sires and sons and spouses, by<br>hundreds and thousands, every one had and will have in this world. Who,<br>however, were they and whose are we? I am quite alone. I have no one whom<br>I may call mine. Nor do I belong to any one else. I do not see that<br>person whose I am, nor do I see him whom I may call mine. They have<br>nothing to do with thee. Thou hest nothing to do with them.[1733] All<br>creatures take birth agreeably to their acts of past lives. Thou also<br>shalt have to go hence (for taking birth in a new order) determined by<br>thy own acts. In this world it is seen that the friends and followers of<br>only those that are rich behave towards the rich with devotion. The<br>friends and followers of those, however, that are poor fall away during<br>even the life-time of the poor. Man commits numerous evil acts for the<br>sake of his wife (and children). From those evil acts he derives much<br>distress both here and hereafter. The wise man beholds the world of life<br>devastated by the acts performed by every living being. Do thou,<br>therefore, O son, act according to all the instructions I have given<br>thee! The man possessed of true vision, beholding this world to be only a<br>field of action, should, from desire of felicity in the next world, do<br>acts that are good. Time, exerting his irresistible strength, cooks all<br>creatures (in his own cauldron), with the aid of his ladle constituted by<br>months and seasons, the sun for his fire, and days and nights for his<br>fuel, days and nights, that is that are the witnesses of the fruits of<br>every act done by every creature. For what purpose is that wealth which<br>is not given away and which is not enjoyed? For what purpose is that<br>strength which is not employed in resisting or subjugating one's foes?<br>For what purpose is that knowledge of the scriptures which does not impel<br>one to deeds of righteousness? And for what purpose is that soul which<br>does not subjugate the senses and abstain from evil acts? "Bhishma<br>continued, 'Having heard these beneficial words spoken by the Island-born<br>(Vyasa), Suka, leaving his sire, proceeded to seek a preceptor that could<br>teach him the religion of Emancipation.'"[1734]
