                            "Parasara said, 'In the Brahmana, wealth acquired by acceptance of gifts,<br>in the Kshatriya that won by victory in battle, in the Vaisya that<br>obtained by following the duties laid down for his order, and in the<br>Sudra that earned by serving the three other orders, however small its<br>measure, is worthy of praise, and spent for the acquisition of virtue is<br>productive of great benefits. The Sudra is said to be the constant<br>servitor of the three other classes. If the Brahmana, pressed for a<br>living, betakes himself to the duties of either the Kshatriya or the<br>Vaisya, he does not fall off from righteousness. When, however, the<br>Brahmana betakes himself to the duties of the lowest order, then does he<br>certainly fall off. When the Sudra is unable to obtain his living by<br>service of the three other orders, then trade, rearing of cattle, and the<br>practice of the mechanical arts are lawful for him to follow. Appearance<br>on the boards of a theatre and disguising oneself in various forms,<br>exhibition of puppets, the sale of spirits and meat, and trading in iron<br>and leather, should never be taken up for purposes of a living by one who<br>had never before been engaged in those professions every one of which is<br>regarded as censurable in the world. It hath been heard by us that if one<br>engaged in them can abandon them, one then acquires great merit. When one<br>that has become successful in life behaves sinfully in consequence of<br>one's mind being filled with arrogance, one's acts under such<br>circumstances can never pass for authority. It is heard in the Puranas<br>that formerly mankind were self-restrained; that they held righteousness<br>in great esteem; that the practices they followed for livelihood were all<br>consistent with propriety and the injunctions laid down in the<br>scriptures: and that the only punishment that was required for chastising<br>them when they went wrong was the crying of fie on them.[1525] At the<br>time of which we speak, O king, Righteousness, and nothing else, was much<br>applauded among men. Having achieved great progress in righteousness, men<br>in those days worshipped only all good qualities that they saw. The<br>Asuras, however, O child, could not bear that righteousness which<br>prevailed in the world. Multiplying (in both number and energy), the<br>Asuras (in the form of Lust and Wrath) entered the bodies of men. Then<br>was pride generated in men that is so destructive of righteousness. From<br>pride arose arrogance, and from arrogance arose wrath. When men thus<br>became overwhelmed with wrath, conduct implying modesty and shame<br>disappeared from them, and then they were overcome by heedlessness.<br>Afflicted by heedlessness, they could no longer see as before, and as the<br>consequence thereof they began to oppress one another and thereby acquire<br>wealth without any compunction. When men became such, the punishment of<br>only crying fie on offenders failed to be of any effect. Men, showing no<br>reverence for either the gods or Brahmanas, began to indulge their senses<br>to their fill.[1526] At that time the deities repaired to that foremost<br>of gods, viz., Siva, possessed of patience, of multiform aspect, and<br>endued with the foremost of attributes, and sought his protection. The<br>deities imparted unto him their conjoined energy, and thereupon the great<br>god, with a single shaft, felled on the earth those three Asuras, viz.,<br>Desire, Wrath, and Cupidity, who were staying in the firmament, along<br>with their very habitations.[1527] The fierce chief of those Asuras<br>possessed of fierce, prowess, who had struck the Devas with terror, was<br>also slain by Mahadeva armed with the lance.[1528] When this chief of the<br>Asuras was slain, men once more obtained their proper natures, and once<br>more began to study the Vedas and the other scriptures as was in former<br>times. Then the seven ancient Rishis came forward and installed Vasava as<br>the chief of the gods and the ruler of heaven. And they took upon<br>themselves the task of holding the rod of chastisement over mankind.<br>After the seven Rishis came king Viprithu (to rule mankind), and many<br>other kings, all belonging to the Kshatriya order for separately ruling<br>separate groups of human beings. (When Mahadeva dispelled all evil<br>passions from the minds of creatures) there were, in those ancient times,<br>certain elderly men from whose minds all wicked feelings did not fly<br>away. Hence, in consequence of that wicked state of their minds and of<br>those incidents that were connected with it, there appeared many kings of<br>terrible prowess who began to indulge in only such acts as were fit for<br>Asuras. Those human beings that are exceedingly foolish adhere to those<br>wicked acts, establish them as authorities, and follow them in practice<br>to this day.[1529] For this reason, O king, I say unto thee, having<br>reflected properly with the aid of the scriptures, that one should<br>abstain from all acts that are fraught with injury or malice and seek to<br>acquire a knowledge of the Soul.[1530]The man possessed of wisdom would<br>not seek wealth for the performance of religious rites by ways that are<br>unrighteous and that involve an abandonment of morality. Wealth earned by<br>such means can never prove beneficial. Do thou then become a Kshatriya of<br>this kind. Do thou restrain thy senses, be agreeable to thy friends, and<br>cherish, according to the duties of thy order, thy subjects, servants,<br>and children. Through the union of both prosperity and adversity (in<br>man's life), there arise friendships and animosities. Thousands and<br>thousands of existences are continually revolving (in respect of every<br>Jiva), and in every mode of Jiva's existence these must occur.[1531] For<br>this reason, be thou attached to good qualities of every kind, but never<br>to faults. Such is the character of good qualities that if the most<br>foolish person, bereft of every virtue, hears himself praised for any<br>good quality, he becomes filled with joy. Virtue and sin exist, O king,<br>only among men. These do not exist among creatures other than man. One<br>should therefore, whether in need of food and other necessaries of life<br>or transcending such need, be of virtuous disposition, acquire knowledge,<br>always look upon all creatures as one's own self, and abstain totally<br>from inflicting any kind of injury. When one's mind becomes divested of<br>desire, and when all Darkness is dispelled from it, it is then that one<br>succeeds in obtaining what is auspicious.'"
