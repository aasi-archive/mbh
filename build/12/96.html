                            "Bhishma said, 'A king should never desire to subjugate the earth by<br>unrighteous means, even if such subjugation would make him the sovereign<br>of the whole earth. What king is there that would rejoice after obtaining<br>victory by unfair means? A victory stained by unrighteousness is<br>uncertain and never leads to heaven. Such a victory, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, weakens both the king and the earth. A warrior whose armour has<br>fallen off, or who begs for quarter, saying, 'I am thine' or joining his<br>hands, or who has laid aside his weapon, may simply be seized but never<br>slain. If a hostile king be vanquished by the troops of the invader, the<br>latter should not himself fight his vanquished foe. On the other hand, he<br>should bring him to his palace and persuade him for a whole year to say,<br>'I am thy slave!' Whether he says or does not say this, the vanquished<br>foe, by living for a year in the house of his victor, gains a new lease<br>of life.[282] If a king succeeds in bringing by force a maiden from the<br>house of his vanquished foe, he should keep her for a year and ask her<br>whether she would wed him or any one else. If she does not agree, she<br>should then be sent back. He should behave similarly in respect of all<br>other kinds of wealth (such as slave) that are acquired by force. The<br>king should never appropriate the wealth confiscated from thieves and<br>others awaiting execution. The kine taken front the enemy by force should<br>be given away to the Brahmanas so that they may drink the milk of those<br>animals. The bulls taken from the enemy should be set to agriculture work<br>or returned to the enemy.[283] It is laid down that a king should fight<br>one that is a king. One that is not a king should never strike one that<br>is a king. If a Brahmana, desirous of peace, fearlessly goes between two<br>contending armies, both should immediately abstain from fight. He would<br>break an eternal rule that would slay or wound a Brahmana. If any<br>Kshatriya breaks that rule, he would become a wretch of his order. In<br>addition to this, that Kshatriya who destroys righteousness and<br>transgresses all wholesome barriers does not deserve to be reckoned as a<br>Kshatriya and should be driven from society. A king desirous of obtaining<br>victory should never follow such conduct. What gain can be greater than<br>victory won righteously? The excitable classes (of a kingdom recently<br>conquered) should, without delay, be conciliated with soothing speeches<br>and gifts. This is a good policy for the king to adopt. If instead of<br>doing this, these men be sought to be governed with impolicy, they would<br>then leave the kingdom and side with (the victor's) foes and wait for the<br>accession of calamities (in order that they may then make head against<br>the victor). Discontented men, watching for the calamities of the king,<br>promptly side with the latter's foes. O monarch, in times of danger. An<br>enemy should not be deceived by unfair means, nor should be wounded<br>mortally. For, if struck mortally, his very life may pass away.[284] If a<br>king possessed of little resources be gratified therewith, he would<br>regard life alone to be much.[285] That king whose dominions are<br>extensive and full of wealth, whose subjects are loyal, whose servants<br>and officers are all contented, is said to have his roots firm. That king<br>whose Ritwijas and priests and preceptors and others about him that are<br>well-versed in all scriptures and deserving of honours are duly<br>respected, is said to be conversant with the ways of the world. It was by<br>such behaviour that Indra got the sovereignty of the world. It is by this<br>behaviour that earthly kings succeed in obtaining the status of Indra.<br>King Pratardana, subjugating his foes in a great battle, took all their<br>wealth, including their very grain and medicinal herbs, but left their<br>land untouched. King Divodasa, after subjugating his foes, brought away<br>the very remnants of their sacrificial fires, their clarified butter<br>(intended for libations), and their food. For this reason he was deprived<br>of the merit of his conquests.[286] King Nabhaga (after his conquests)<br>gave away whole kingdoms with their rulers as sacrificial presents unto<br>the Brahmanas, excepting the wealth of learned Brahmanas and ascetics.<br>The behaviour, O Yudhishthira, of all the righteous kings of old, was<br>excellent, and I approve of it wholly. That king who desires his own<br>prosperity should seek for conquests by the aid of every kind of<br>excellence but never with that of deceit or with pride.'"
