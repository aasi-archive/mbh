                            "Bhishma said, 'In this connection, viz., the method by which a king<br>should fill his treasury, persons acquainted with the scriptures of olden<br>days cite the following verses sung by Brahman himself. The wealth of<br>persons who are given to the performance of sacrifices, as also the<br>wealth dedicated to the deities, should never be taken. A Kshatriya<br>should take the wealth of such persons as never perform religious rites<br>and sacrifices as are on that account regarded to be equal to robbers.<br>All the creatures that inhabit the earth and all the enjoyments that<br>appertain to sovereignty, O Bharata, belong to the Kshatriyas. All the<br>wealth of the earth belongs to the Kshatriya, and not to any person else.<br>That wealth the Kshatriya should use for keeping up his army and for the<br>performance of sacrifice. Tearing up such creepers and plants as are not<br>of any use, men burn them for cooking such vegetables as serve for<br>food.[407] Men conversant with duty have said that his wealth is useless<br>who does not, with libations of clarified butter, feed the gods, the<br>Pitris, and men. A virtuous ruler, O king, should take away such wealth.<br>By that wealth a large number of good people can be gratified. He should<br>not, however, hoard that wealth in his treasury. He who makes himself an<br>instrument of acquisition and taking away wealth from the wicked gives<br>them to those that are good is said to be conversant with the whole<br>science of morality. A king should extend his conquests in the next world<br>according to the measure of his power, and as gradually as vegetable<br>products are seen to grow. As some ants are seen to grow from no adequate<br>cause, even so sacrifice spring from no adequate cause.[408] As flies and<br>gnats and ants are driven off from the bodies of kine and other domestic<br>cattle (at the time of milking them), even so should persons who are<br>averse to the performance of sacrifices should be similarly driven off<br>from the kingdom. This is consistent with morality. As the dust that lies<br>on the earth, if pounded between two stones, becomes finer and finer,<br>even so questions of morality, the more they are reflected upon and<br>discussed, become finer and finer.'"
