                            "Bhishma said, 'After this, he of hundred sacrifices beheld the goddess<br>of Prosperity, in her own embodied form that blazed splendour, issue out<br>of the form of the high-souled Vali. The illustrious chastiser of Paka,<br>beholding the goddess blazing with radiance, addressed Vali in these<br>words, with eyes expanded in wonder.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'O Vali, who is this one, thus shining with splendour, thus<br>decked with head plumes, thus adorned with golden bracelets on her upper<br>arms, and thus emitting a halo of glory on all sides in consequence of<br>her energy that is issuing out of thy body.'<br><br>"Vali said, 'I do not know whether she is an Asura damsel or a celestial<br>one or a human one. Thou mayst not ask her thyself. Do what pleases thee.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'O thou of sweet smiles, who art thou that art possessed of<br>such radiance and adorned with plumes that thus issuest from the body of<br>Vali. I do not know thee. Kindly tell me thy name. Who, indeed, art thou<br>that thus standest here as Maya herself, blazing with thy own splendour,<br>after having deserted the lord of the Daityas? O, tell me this as I<br>question thee.'<br><br>"Sree said, 'Virochana did not know me. This Vali also that is the son of<br>Virochana knows me not. The learned called me by the name of<br>Duhshaha.[844] Some knew me by the name of Vidhitsa.[845] I have other<br>names also, O Vasava! They are Bhuti, Lakshmi, and Sree.[846] Thou<br>knowest me not, O Sakra, nor doth any one among the deities know me.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'O lady that is difficult of being borne, why do you desert<br>Vali now after having lived in him for a long time? Is it due to any act<br>of mine or is it due to any act that Vali has done?'<br><br>"Sree said, 'Neither the Creator nor the Ordainer rules me. It is Time<br>that moves me from one place to another. Do not, O Sakra, disregard Vali.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'For what reason, O goddess adorned with plumes, do you<br>desert Vali? Why also do you approach me (for living in me)? Tell me<br>this, O thou of sweet smiles!'<br><br>'Sree said, 'I live in truth, in gifts, in good vows, in penances, in<br>prowess, and in virtue. Vali hath fallen off from all these. Formerly, he<br>was devoted to the Brahmanas. He was truthful and had controlled his<br>passions. Latterly, however, he began to cherish feelings of animosity<br>towards the Brahmanas and touched clarified butter with soiled<br>hands.[847] Formerly, he was always engaged in the performance of<br>sacrifices. At last, blinded by ignorance and afflicted by Time he began<br>to boast before all persons, saying that his adorations towards me were<br>ceaseless. Deserting him (for these faults) I shall henceforth, O Sakra,<br>dwell in thee. Thou shouldst bear me without heedlessness, and with<br>penances and prowess.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'O thou that dwellest amid lotuses, there is not a single<br>person among gods, men, and all creatures, that can bear thee for ever.'<br><br>"Sree said, 'Truly, O Purandara, there is none among gods, Gandharvas,<br>Asuras, or Rakshasas, that can bear me for ever.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'O auspicious lady, tell me how I should conduct myself so<br>that thou mayst dwell in me always. I shall certainly obey thy behests.<br>It behoveth thee to answer me truly.'<br><br>"Sree said, 'O chief of the deities, I shall tell thee as to how I may be<br>enabled to dwell in thee always. Divide me into four parts according to<br>the ordinance laid down in the Vedas.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'I shall assign the habitations according to their strength<br>and power in bearing thee. As regards myself, I shall always take care, O<br>Lakshmi, that I may not offend thee in any way. Amongst men, the earth,<br>that progenitrix of all things, bear them all. She shall bear a fourth<br>part of thyself. I think she hath the strength to do it.'<br><br>"Sree said, 'Here, I yield up a quarter of myself. Let it be established<br>on the earth. Do thou, after this, make a proper disposition, O Sakra,<br>for my second quarter.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'The waters, among men, in their liquid form, do various<br>services to human beings. Let the waters bear a fourth part of thy<br>person. They have the strength to bear a portion of thine.'<br><br>"Sree said, 'I yield up another quarter of mine that is to be established<br>in the waters. Do thou, after this, O Sakra, assign a proper place for my<br>third quarter.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'The Vedas, the sacrifices, and the deities are all<br>established in Fire. Fire will bear thy third quarter, when it is placed<br>therein.'<br><br>"Sree said, 'Here I yield up my third quarter which is to be placed in<br>Fire. Do thou, O Sakra, after this, assign a proper place for my last<br>quarter.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'They that are good among men, devoted to Brahmanas, and<br>truthful in speech, may bear thy fourth quarter. The good have the power<br>to bear it.'<br><br>"Sree said, 'Here I yield up my fourth quarter that is to be placed among<br>the good. My portions thus assigned to different creatures, do thou<br>continue to protect me, O Sakra.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'Listen to these words of mine. I have thus distributed thee<br>among different creatures. Those among creatures that will offend against<br>thee shall be chastised by me. The chief of the Daityas, viz., Vali, thus<br>deserted by Sree, then said these words.'<br><br>"Vali said, 'At present the Sun shines as much in the east as in the<br>west, and as much in the north as in the south. When, however, the Sun,<br>withdrawing himself from all sides, will shine only upon the region of<br>Brahman situated in the middle of Sumeru, then will again occur a great<br>battle between the gods and the Asuras, and in that fight I shall<br>certainly vanquish all of you. When the Sun, withdrawing himself from all<br>sides, will shine fixedly upon only the region of Brahman, then will<br>again occur a great battle between the gods and the Asuras, and in that<br>fight I shall surely conquer all of you.'[848]<br><br>"Sakra said, 'Brahman hath commanded me saying that I should never kill<br>thee. It is for this reason, O Vali, that I do not hurl my thunderbolt<br>upon thy head. Go whithersoever thou wishest, O chief of the Daityas! O<br>great Asura, peace to thee! No time will come when the Sun will shine<br>from only the meridian. The Self-born (Brahman) hath before this ordained<br>the laws that regulate the Sun's motions. Giving light and heat to all<br>creatures, he goes on ceaselessly. For six months he travels in a<br>northward course and then for the other six in a southward course. The<br>sun travels by these courses (one after another), creating winter and<br>summer for all creatures.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by Indra, O Bharata, Vali, the chief<br>of the Daityas, proceeded towards the south. Purandara proceeded towards<br>the north. The thousand-eyed Indra, after having listened to this speech<br>of Vali which was characterised by an entire absence of pride, then<br>ascended the skies.'
