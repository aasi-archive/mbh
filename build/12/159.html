                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast said, O grandsire, that the foundation of<br>all evils is covetousness. I wish, O sire, to hear of ignorance in<br>detail.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The person who commits sin through ignorance, who does<br>not know that his end is at hand, and who always hates those that are of<br>good behaviour, soon incurs infamy in the world. In consequence of<br>ignorance one sinks into hell. Ignorance is the spring of misery. Through<br>ignorance one' suffers afflictions and incurs great danger.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'I desire, O king, to hear in detail the origin, the<br>place, the growth, the decay, the rise, the root, the inseparable<br>attribute, the course, the time, the cause, and the consequence, of<br>ignorance. The misery that is felt here is all born of ignorance.'[456]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Attachment, hate, loss of judgment, joy, sorrow, vanity,<br>lust, anger, pride, procrastination, idleness, desire, aversion,<br>jealousy, and all other sinful acts are all known by the common name of<br>ignorance.[457] Hear now, O king, in detail, about its tendency, growth<br>and other features after which thou enquirest. These two viz., ignorance<br>and covetousness, know, O king, are the same (in substance). Both are<br>productive of the same fruits and same faults, O Bharata! Ignorance has<br>its origin in covetousness. As covetousness grows, ignorance also grows.<br>Ignorance exists there where covetousness exists. As covetousness<br>decreases, ignorance also decreases. It rises with the rise of<br>covetousness. Manifold again is the course that it takes. The root of<br>covetousness is loss of judgment. Loss of judgment, again, is its<br>inseparable attribute. Eternity is ignorance's course. The time when<br>ignorance appears is when objects of covetousness are not won. From one's<br>ignorance proceeds covetousness, and from the latter proceeds ignorance.<br>(Covetousness, therefore, is both the cause and consequence of<br>ignorance). Covetousness is productive of all. For these reasons, every<br>one should avoid covetousness. Janaka, and Yuvanaswa, and Vrishadarbhi,<br>and Prasenajit, and other kings acquired heaven in consequence of their<br>having repressed covetousness. Do thou also in the sight of all persons,<br>avoid covetousness by a strong resolution, O chief of the Kurus! Avoiding<br>covetousness thou shalt obtain happiness both here and in the next<br>world.'"
