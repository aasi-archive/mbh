                            "Bhishma said, 'The fowler, seeing the pigeon fall into the fire, became<br>filled with compassion and once more said, 'Alas, cruel and senseless<br>that I am, what have I done! I ant certainly a mean wretch! Great will be<br>my sin for everlasting years! Indulging in such self-reproaches he began<br>to say, repeatedly, 'I am unworthy of credit. My understanding is wicked.<br>I am ever sinful in my resolves. Alas, abandoning all kinds of honourable<br>occupation, I have become a fowler A cruel wretch that I am, without<br>doubt, this high-souled pigeon, by laying down his own life, has read me<br>a grave lesson. Abandoning wives and sons, I shall certainly cast off my<br>very life-breaths that are so dear. The high-souled pigeon has taught me<br>that duty. From this day, denying every comfort to my body, I shall wear<br>it out even as a shallow tank in the season of summer. Capable of bearing<br>hunger, thirst, and penances, reduced to emaciation, and covered with<br>visible veins all over, I shall, by diverse kinds of practise such vows<br>as have a reference to the other world. Alas, by giving up his body, the<br>pigeon has shown the worship that should be paid to a guest. Taught by<br>his example. I shall henceforth practise righteousness. Righteousness is<br>the highest refuge (of all creatures). Indeed, I shall practise such<br>righteousness as has been seen in the righteous pigeon, that foremost of<br>all winged creatures.' Having formed such a resolution and said these<br>words, that fowler, once of fierce deeds, proceeded to make an<br>unreturning tour of the world,[436] observing for the while the most<br>rigid vows. He threw away his stout staff, his sharp-pointed iron-stick,<br>his nets and springes, and his iron cage, and set at liberty the<br>she-pigeon that he had seized and immured.'"
