                            "Bhishma said, 'After the fowler had left that spot, the she-pigeon,<br>remembering her husband and afflicted with grief on his account, wept<br>copiously and indulged in these lamentations, 'I cannot, O dear lord,<br>recollect a single instance of thy having done me an injury! Widows, even<br>if mothers of many children, are still miserable! Bereft of her husband,<br>a woman becomes helpless and an object of pity with her friends. I was<br>always cherished by thee, and in consequence of the great respect thou<br>hadst for me I was always honoured by thee with sweet, agreeable,<br>charming, and delightful words. I sported with thee in valleys, in<br>springs of rivers, and on delightful tops of trees. I was also made happy<br>by thee while roving with thee through the skies. I used to sport with<br>thee before, O dear lord, but where are those joys now? Limited are the<br>gifts of the father, of the brother, and of the son to a woman. The gifts<br>that her husband alone makes to her are unlimited. What woman is there<br>that would not, therefore, adore her lord? A woman has no protector like<br>her lord, and no happiness like her lord. Abandoning all her wealth and<br>possessions, a woman should take to her lord as her only refuge. Life<br>here is of no use to me, O lord, now that I am separated from thee. What<br>chaste woman is there that would, when deprived of her lord, venture to<br>bear the burden of life?' Filled with sorrow and indulging in such<br>piteous lamentations, the she-pigeon, devoted to her lord, cast herself<br>on the blazing fire. She then beheld her (deceased) husband adorned with<br>bracelets, seated on a (celestial) car, and adored by many high-souled<br>and meritorious beings standing around him. Indeed, there he was in the<br>firmament, decked with fine garlands and attired in excellent robes, and<br>adorned with every ornament. Around him were innumerable celestial cars<br>ridden by beings who had acted meritoriously while in this world. Seated<br>on his own celestial car, the bird ascended to heaven, and obtaining<br>proper honours for his deeds in this world, continued to sport in joy,<br>accompanied by his wife.'"
