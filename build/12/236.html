                            "Vyasa said, 'If Emancipation be desirable, then knowledge should be<br>acquired. For a person who is borne now up and now down along the stream<br>of Time or life, knowledge is the raft by which he can reach the shore.<br>Those wise men who have arrived at certain conclusions (regarding the<br>character of the soul and that which is called life) by the aid of<br>wisdom, are able to assist the ignorant in crossing the stream of time or<br>life with the raft of knowledge. They, however, that are ignorant, are<br>unable save either themselves or others. He who has freed himself from<br>desire and all other faults, and who has emancipated himself from all<br>attachments, should attend to, these two and ten requirements of yoga,<br>viz., place, acts, affection, objects, means, destruction, certainty,<br>eyes, food, suppression, mind and survey.[905] He who wishes to obtain<br>superior Knowledge, should, by the aid of his understanding, restrain<br>both speech and mind. He who wishes to have tranquillity, should, by the<br>aid of his knowledge, restrain his soul. Whether he becomes compassionate<br>or cruel, whether he becomes conversant with all the Vedas or ignorant of<br>the Richs, whether he becomes righteous and observant of sacrifices or<br>the worst of sinners, whether he becomes eminent for prowess and wealth<br>or plunged into misery, that person who directs his mind towards these<br>(attributes that I have spoken of), is sure to cross the ocean of life<br>which is so difficult to cross. Without speaking of the results of the<br>attainment of Brahma by yoga, it may be said that he who sets himself to<br>only enquiring after the Soul transcends the necessity of observing the<br>acts laid down in the Vedas. The body with jiva within it is an excellent<br>car. When sacrifices and religious rites are made its upastha, shame its<br>varutha, Upaya and Apaya its kuvara, the breath called Apana its aksha,<br>the breath called Prana its yuga, knowledge and the allotted period of<br>existence its points for tying the steeds, heedfulness its handsome<br>vandhura, the assumption of good behaviour its nemi, vision, touch,<br>scent, and hearing its four steeds, wisdom its nabhi, all the scriptures<br>its pratoda, certain knowledge of the scriptural declarations its driver,<br>the soul its firmly-seated rider, faith and self-restraint its<br>fore-runners, renunciation its inseparable companion following behind and<br>bent upon doing it good, purity the path along which it goes, meditation<br>(or union with Brahma) its goal, then may that car reach Brahma and shine<br>there in effulgence.[906] I shall now tell thee the speedy means that<br>should be adopted by the person who would equip his car in such a fashion<br>for passing through this wilderness of the world in order to reach the<br>goal constituted by Brahma that is above decrepitude and destruction. To<br>set the mind upon one thing at a time is called Dharana.[907] The Yogin<br>observing proper vows and restraints, practises in all seven kinds of<br>Dharana. There are, again, as many kinds of Dharanas arising out of<br>these, upon subjects that are near or remote.[908] Through these the<br>Yogin gradually acquires mastery over Earth, Wind, Space, Water, Fire,<br>Consciousness, and Understanding. After this he gradually acquires<br>mastery over the Unmanifest.[909] I shall now describe to thee the<br>conceptions in their order that are realised by particular individuals<br>amongst those that are engaged in yoga according to the rules and<br>ordinances that have been laid down. I shall tell thee also of the nature<br>of the success that attaches to yoga commenced (according to rules) by<br>him who looks within his own self.[910] The Yogin, that abandons his<br>gross body, following the instructions of his preceptor, beholds his soul<br>displaying the following forms in consequence of its subtility. To him in<br>the first stage, the welkin seems to be filled with a subtile substance<br>like foggy vapour.[911] Of the Soul which has been freed from the body,<br>even such becomes the form. When this fog disappears, a second (or new)<br>form becomes visible. For, then, the Yogin beholds within himself, in the<br>firmament of his heart, the form of Water. After the disappearance of<br>water, the form of Fire displays itself. When this disappears, the form<br>that becomes perceivable is that of Wind as effulgent as a well-tempered<br>weapon of high polish. Gradually, the form displayed by Wind becomes like<br>that of the thinnest gossamer. Then having acquired whiteness, and also,<br>the subtlety of air, the Brahman's soul is said to attain the supreme<br>whiteness and subtlety of Ether. Listen to me as I tell thee the<br>consequences of these diverse conditions when they occur. That Yogin who<br>has been able to achieve the conquest of the earth-element, attains by<br>such lordship to the power of Creation. Like a second Prajapati endued<br>with a nature that is perfectly imperturbable, he can from his own body<br>create all kinds of creatures. With only his toe, or with his hand or<br>feet, that person can singly cause the whole Earth to tremble who has<br>achieved the lordship of the Wind. Even this is the attribute of the Wind<br>as declared in the Sruti. The Yogin, who has achieved the lordship of<br>Space, can exist brightly in Space in consequence of his having attained<br>to uniformity with that element, and can also disappear at will. By<br>lordship over Water, one can (like Agastya) drink up rivers, lakes, and<br>oceans. By lordship over Fire, the Yogin becomes so effulgent that his<br>form cannot be looked at. He becomes visible only when he extinguishes<br>his consciousness of individuality,&#8212;these five elements come within his<br>sway. When the Understanding, which is the soul of the five elements and<br>of the consciousness of individuality,[912] is conquered the Yogin<br>attains to Omnipotence, and perfect Knowledge (or perception freed from<br>doubt and uncertainty with respect to all things), comes to him. In<br>consequence of this, the Manifest becomes merged into the Unmanifest or<br>Supreme Soul from which the world emanates and becomes what is called<br>Manifest.[913] Listen now to me in detail as I expound the science of the<br>Unmanifest. But first of all listen to me about all that is Manifest as<br>expounded in the Sankhya system of philosophy. In both the Yoga and the<br>Sankhya, systems, five and twenty topics of knowledge have been treated<br>in nearly the same way. Listen to me as I mention their chief features.<br>That has been said to be Manifest which is possessed of these four<br>attributes, viz., birth, growth, decay, and death. That which is not<br>possessed of these attributes is said to be Unmanifest. Two souls are<br>mentioned in the Vedas and the sciences that are based upon them. The<br>first (which is called Jivatman) is endued with the four attributes<br>already mentioned, and has a longing for the four objects or purposes<br>(viz., Religion, Wealth, Pleasure and Emancipation). This soul is called<br>Manifest, and it is born of the Unmanifest (Supreme Soul). It is both<br>Intelligent and non-Intelligent. I have thus told thee about Sattwa<br>(inert matter) and Kshetrajna (immaterial spirit). Both kinds of Soul, it<br>is said in the Vedas, become attached to objects of the senses. The<br>doctrine of the Sankhyas is that one should keep oneself aloof or<br>dissociated from objects of the senses. That Yogin who is freed from<br>attachment and pride, who transcends all pairs of opposites, such as<br>pleasure and pain, heat and cold, etc., who never gives way to wrath or<br>hate, who never speaks an untruth, who, though slandered or struck, still<br>shows friendship for the slanderer or the striker, who never thinks of<br>doing ill to others, who restrains the three, viz., speech, acts, and<br>mind, and who behaves uniformly towards all creatures, succeeds in<br>approaching the presence of Brahman. That person who cherishes no desire<br>for earthly objects, who is not unwilling to take what comes, who is<br>dependent on earthly objects to only that extent which is necessary for<br>sustaining life, who is free from cupidity, who has driven off all grief,<br>who has restrained his senses, who goes through all necessary acts, who<br>is regardless of personal appearance and attire, whose senses are all<br>collected (for devotion to the true objects of life), whose purposes are<br>never left, unaccomplished,[914] who bears himself with equal<br>friendliness towards all creatures, who regards a clod of earth and a<br>lump of gold with an equal eye, who is equally disposed towards friend<br>and foe, who is possessed of patience, who takes praise and blame<br>equally,[915] who is free from longing with respect to all objects of<br>desire, who practises Brahmacharya, and who is firm and steady in all his<br>vows and observances, who has no malice or envy for any creature in the<br>universe, is a Yogin who according to the Sankhya system succeeds in<br>winning Emancipation. Listen now to the way and the means by which a<br>person may win Emancipation through Yoga (or the system of Patanjali).<br>That person who moves and acts after having transcended the puissance<br>that the practice of Yoga brings about (in the initial stages), succeeds<br>in winning Emancipation.[916] I have thus discoursed to thee on those<br>topics (viz., Emancipation according to the Sankhya system and that<br>according to the Yoga system) which are dissimilar if the speaker be<br>disposed to treat them as such (but which in reality, are one and the<br>same).[917] Thus can one transcend all pairs of opposites. Thus can one<br>attain to Brahma.'"[918]
