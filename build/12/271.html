                            "Yudhishthira said, 'The Vedas, O Bharata, discourse of Religion. Profit,<br>and Pleasure. Tell me, however, O grandsire, the attainment of which<br>(amongst these three) is regarded as superior.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall, in this connection, recite to thee the ancient<br>narrative of the benefit that Kundadhara in days of old had conferred<br>upon one who was devoted to him. Once on a time a Brahmana destitute of<br>wealth sought to acquire virtue, induced by the desire of fruit. He<br>continually set his heart upon wealth for employing it in the celebration<br>of sacrifices. For achieving his purpose he set himself to the practice<br>of the austerest penances. Resolved to accomplish his purpose, he began<br>to worship the deities with great devotion. But he failed to obtain<br>wealth by such worship of the deities. He thereupon began to reflect,<br>saying unto himself, 'What is that deity, hitherto unadored by men, who<br>may be favourably disposed towards me without delay?' While reflecting in<br>this strain with a cool mind, he beheld stationed before him that<br>retainer of the deities, viz., the Cloud called Kundadhara. As soon as he<br>beheld that mighty-armed being, the Brahmana's feelings of devotion were<br>excited, and he said unto himself, 'This one will surely bestow<br>prosperity upon me. Indeed, his form indicates as much. He lives in close<br>proximity to the deities. He has not as yet been adored by other men. He<br>will verily give me abundant wealth without any delay.' The Brahmana,<br>then, having concluded thus, worshipped that Cloud with dhupas and<br>perfumes and garlands of flowers of the most superior kind, and with<br>diverse kinds of offerings. Thus worshipped, the Cloud became very soon<br>pleased with his worshipper and uttered these words fraught with benefit<br>to that Brahmana, 'The wise have ordained expiation for one guilty of<br>Brahmanicide, or of drinking alcohol or of stealing, or of neglecting all<br>meritorious vows. There is no expiation, however, for one that is<br>ungrateful.[1278] Expectation hath a child named Iniquity. Ire, again, is<br>regarded to be a child of Envy. Cupidity is the child of Deceit.<br>Ingratitude, however, is barren (and hath no offspring). After this, that<br>Brahmana, stretched on a bed of Kusa grass, and penetrated with the<br>energy of Kundadhara, beheld all living beings in a dream. Indeed, in<br>consequence of his absence of passion, penances, and devotion, that<br>Brahmana of cleansed soul, standing aloof from all (carnal) enjoyments,<br>beheld in the night that effect of his devotion to Kundadhara. Indeed, O<br>Yudhishthira, he beheld the high-souled Manibhadra of great effulgence<br>stationed in the midst of the deities, employed in giving his orders.<br>There the gods seemed to be engaged in bestowing kingdoms and riches upon<br>men, induced by their good deeds, and in taking them away when men fell<br>off from goodness.[1279] Then, O bull of Bharata's race, Kundadhara of<br>great effulgence, bending himself low, prostrated himself on the ground<br>before the gods in the presence of all the Yakshas. At the command of the<br>gods the high-souled Manibhadra addressed the prostrate Kundadhara and<br>said, 'What does Kundadhara want?' Thereupon Kundadhara replied, 'If,<br>indeed, the gods are pleased with me, there, that Brahmana reverences me<br>greatly. I pray for some favour being shown to him, something, that is,<br>that may bring him happiness.' Hearing this, Manibhadra, commanded by the<br>gods, once more said unto Kundadhara of great intelligence these words,<br>'Rise, rise up, O Kundadhara! Thy suit is successful. Be thou happy. If<br>this Brahmana be desirous of wealth, let wealth be given to him, that is,<br>as much wealth as this thy friend desires. At the command of the gods I<br>shall give him untold wealth.' Kundadhara, then, reflecting upon the<br>fleeting and unreal character of the status of humanity, set his heart, O<br>Yudhishthira, upon inclining the Brahmana to penances. Indeed, Kundadhara<br>said, 'I do not, O giver of wealth, beg for wealth on behalf of this<br>Brahmana. I desire the bestowal of another favour upon him. I do not<br>solicit for this devotee of mine mountains of pearls and gems or even.<br>the whole earth with all her riches. I desire, however, that he should be<br>virtuous. Let his heart find pleasure in virtue. Let him have virtue for<br>his stay. Let virtue be the foremost of all objects with him. Even this<br>is the favour that meets with my approval.' Manibhadra said, 'The fruits<br>of virtue are always sovereignty and happiness of diverse kinds. Let this<br>one enjoy those fruits, always freed from physical pain of every kind.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed, Kundadhara, however, of great<br>celebrity, repeatedly solicited virtue alone for that Brahmana. The gods<br>were highly pleased at it. Then Manibhadra said, 'The gods are all<br>pleased with thee as also with this Brahmana. This one shall become a<br>virtuous-souled person. He shall devote his mind to virtue.' The Cloud,<br>Kundadhara, became delighted, O Yudhishthira, at thus having been<br>successful in obtaining his wish. The boon that he had got was one that<br>was unattainable by anybody else. The Brahmana then beheld scattered<br>around him many delicate fabrics of cloth. Without minding them at all<br>(although so costly), the Brahmana came to disrelish the world.'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'When this one doth not set any value upon good<br>deeds, who else will? I had better go to the woods for leading a life of<br>righteousness.'[1280]<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Cherishing a distaste for the world, and through the<br>grace also of the gods, that foremost of Brahmanas entered the woods and<br>commenced to undergo the austerest of penances. Subsisting upon Such<br>fruits and roots as remained after serving the deities and guests, the<br>mind of that regenerate person, O monarch, was firmly set upon virtue.<br>Gradually, the Brahmana, renouncing fruits and roots, betook himself to<br>leaves of trees as his food. Then renouncing leaves, he took to water<br>only as his subsistence. After that he passed many years by subsisting<br>upon air alone. All the while, his strength did not diminish. This seemed<br>exceedingly marvellous. Devoted to virtue and engaged in the practice of<br>the severest austerities, after a long time he acquired spiritual vision.<br>He then reflected, saying unto himself, 'If, being gratified with<br>anybody, I give him wealth, my speech would never be untrue.'[1281] With<br>a face lighted up by smiles, he once more began to undergo severer<br>austerities. And once more, having won (higher) success, he thought that<br>he could, by a fiat of the will, then create the very highest objects.<br>'If, gratified with any person whatsoever I give him even sovereignty, he<br>will immediately become a king, for my words will never be untrue.' While<br>he was thinking in this way, Kundadhara, induced by his friendship for<br>the Brahmana and no less by the ascetic success which the Brahmana had<br>achieved, showed himself, O Bharata (unto his friend and devotee).<br>Meeting with him the Brahmana offered him worship according to the<br>observances ordained. The Brahmana, however, felt some surprise, O king.<br>Then Kundadhara addressed the Brahmana, saying, 'Thou hast now got an<br>excellent and spiritual eye. Behold with this vision of thine the end<br>that is attained by kings, and survey all the worlds besides.' The<br>Brahmana then, with his spiritual vision, beheld from a distance<br>thousands of kings sunk in hell.'<br><br>"Kundadhara said, 'After having worshipped me with devotion thou didst<br>get sorrow for thy share, what then would have been the good done to thee<br>by me, and what the value of my favour? Look, look for what end men<br>desire the gratification of carnal enjoyments. The door of heaven is<br>closed unto men.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The Brahmana then beheld many men living in this<br>world, embracing lust, and wrath, and cupidity, and fear, and pride, and<br>sleep and procrastination, and inactivity.'<br><br>"Kundadhara said, 'With these (vices) all human beings are enchained. The<br>gods are afraid of men. These vices, at the command of the gods, mar and<br>disconcert on every side.[1282] No man can become virtuous unless<br>permitted by the gods. (In consequence of their permission) thou hast<br>become competent to give away kingdoms and wealth through thy penances.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed, the righteous-souled Brahmana,<br>bending his head unto that Cloud, prostrated himself on the ground, and<br>said, 'Thou hast, indeed, done me a great favour. Unconscious of the<br>great affection shown by thee towards me, I had through the influence of<br>desire and cupidity, failed to display good will towards thee.' Then<br>Kundadhara said unto that foremost of regenerate persons, 'I have<br>forgiven thee,' and having embraced him with his arms disappeared there<br>and then. The Brahmana then roamed through all the worlds, having<br>attained to ascetic success through the grace of Kundadhara. Through the<br>puissance gained from virtue and penances, one acquires competence to<br>sail through the skies and to fructify all one's wishes and purposes, and<br>finally attain to the highest end. The gods and Brahmanas and Yakshas and<br>all good men and Charanas always adore those that are virtuous but never<br>those that are rich or given up to the indulgence of their desires. The<br>gods are truly propitious to thee since thy mind is devoted to virtue. In<br>wealth there may be a very little happiness but in virtue the measure of<br>happiness is very great.'"
