                            (contd.)<br><br>Listen now to the circumstances under which men, by<br>even committing these acts, do not become stained with sin. If a Brahmana<br>well acquainted with the Vedas takes up arms and rushes against thee in<br>battle for killing thee, thou mayst proceed against him for taking his<br>life. By such an act the slayer does not become guilty of the slaughter<br>of a Brahmana.[113] There is a mantra in the Vedas, O son of Kunti, that<br>lays this down, I declare unto thee only those practices that are<br>sanctioned by the authority of the Vedas. One who slays a Brahmana that<br>has fallen away from his own duties and that advances, weapon in hand,<br>with intent to slaughter, does not truly become the slayer of a Brahmana.<br>In such a case it is the wrath of the slayer that proceeds against the<br>wrath of the slain. A person by drinking alcoholic stimulants in<br>ignorance or upon the advice of a virtuous physician when his life is at<br>peril, should have the regenerating ceremonies performed once more in his<br>case. All that I have told thee, O son of Kunti, about the eating of<br>interdicted food, may be cleansed by such expiatory rites. Connection<br>with the preceptor's wife at the preceptor's command does not stain the<br>pupil. The sage Uddalaka caused his son Swetaketu to be begotten by a<br>disciple. A person by committing theft for the sake of his preceptor in a<br>season of distress is not stained with sin. One, however, that takes to<br>thieving for procuring enjoyments for himself becomes stained. One is not<br>stained by stealing from other than Brahmanas (in a season of distress<br>and for the sake of one's preceptor). Only one that steals under such<br>circumstances without himself appropriating any portion thereof is<br>untouched by sin. A falsehood may be spoken for saving one's own life or<br>that of another, or for the sake of one's preceptor, or for gratifying a<br>woman, or for bringing about a marriage. One's vow of Brahmacharya is not<br>broken by having wet dreams. In such cases the expiation laid down<br>consists in the pouring of libations of clarified butter on the blazing<br>fire. If the elder brother be fallen or has renounced the world, the<br>younger brother does not incur sin by marrying. Solicited by a woman,<br>connection with her is not destructive of virtue. One should not slay or<br>cause to be slain an animal except in a sacrifice. Animals have become<br>sacred (fit for sacrifice) through the kindness manifested towards them<br>by the Creator himself in the ordinance laid down by him. By making a<br>gift in ignorance to an undeserving Brahmana one does not incur sin. The<br>omission (through ignorance) to behave with liberality towards a<br>deserving person does not lead to sin. By casting off an adulterous wife<br>one does not incur sin. By such treatment the woman herself may be purged<br>while the husband may avoid sin. One who knows the true use of the Soma<br>juice, does not incur sin by selling it.[114] By dismissing a servant who<br>is incompetent to render service one is not touched by sin. I have now<br>said unto thee those acts by doing which one does not incur sin. I shall<br>now speak to thee of expiation in detail.'"
