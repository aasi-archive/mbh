                            "Yudhishthira asked, 'Who were the first Prajapatis, O bull of Bharata's<br>race? What highly-blessed Rishis are there in existence and on which<br>points of the compass do each of them dwell?'<br><br>"Bhishma said., 'Hear me, O chief of the Bharatas, about what thou askest<br>me. I shall tell thee who the Prajapatis were and what Rishis are<br>mentioned as dwelling on which point of the horizon. There was at first<br>one Eternal, Divine, and Self-born Brahman. The Self-born Brahman begat<br>seven illustrious sons. They were Marichi, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya,<br>Pulaha, Kratu, and the highly-blessed Vasishtha who was equal to the<br>Self-born himself. These seven sons have been mentioned in the Puranas as<br>seven Brahmanas. I shall now mention all the Prajapatis who came after<br>these. In Atri's race was born the eternal and divine Varhi the ancient,<br>who had penances for his origin. From Varhi the ancient sprang the ten<br>Prachetasas. The ten Prachetasas had one son between them, viz., the<br>Prajapati called by the name of Daksha. This last has two names in the<br>world, viz., Daksha and Kasyapa. Marichi had one son called Kasyapa. This<br>last also has two names. Some call him Arishtanemi, and some Kasyapa.<br>Atri had another son born of his lions, viz., the handsome and princely<br>Soma of great energy. He performed penances for a thousand celestial<br>Yugas. The divine Aryaman and they who were born unto him as his sons, O<br>monarch, have been described as setters of commands, and creators of all<br>creatures. Sasavindu had ten thousand wives. Upon each of them their lord<br>begat a thousand sons, and so the tale reached ten hundred thousands.<br>Those sons refused to call anybody else save themselves as Prajapatis.<br>The ancient Brahmanas bestowed an appellation on the creatures of the<br>world, derived from Sasavindu. That extensive race of the Prajapati<br>Sasavindu became in time the progenitor of the Vrishni race. These that I<br>have mentioned are noted as the illustrious Prajapatis. After this, I<br>shall mention the deities that are the lords of the three worlds. Bhaga,<br>Ansa, Aryyaman, Mitra, Varna, Savitri, Dhatri, Vivaswat of great might,<br>Tvashtri, Pushan, Indra, and Vishnu known as the twelfth,&#8212;these are the<br>twelve Adityas, all sprung from Kasyapa. Nasatya and Dasra are mentioned<br>as the two Aswins. These two are the sons of the illustrious Martanda,<br>the eighth in the above tale. These were called first the gods and the<br>two classes of Pitris. Tvashtri had many sons. Amongst them were the<br>handsome and famous Viswarupa, Ajaikapat, Ahi, Bradhna, Virupaksha, and<br>Raivata. Then there were Hara and Vahurupa, Tryamvaka the chief of the<br>Deities, and Savitrya, Jayanta and Pinaki the invincible. The<br>highly-blessed Vasus, eight in number, have formerly been enumerated by<br>me. These were reckoned as gods at the time of the Prajapati Manu. These<br>were at first called the gods and the Pitris. Amongst the Siddhas and the<br>Sadhyas there were two classes in consequence of conduct and youth. The<br>deities were formerly considered to be of two classes, viz., the Ribhus<br>and the Maruts. Thus have the Viswas, the gods and the Aswins, been<br>enumerated. Amongst them, the Adityas are Kshatriyas, and the Maruts are<br>Vaisyas. The two Aswins, engaged in severe penances, have been said to be<br>Sudras. The deities sprung from Angirasa's line have been said to be<br>Brahmanas. This is certain. Thus have I told thee about the fourfold<br>order among the gods. The person who, after rising from his bed at morn,<br>recites the names of these deities, becomes cleansed of all his sins<br>whether committed by himself intentionally or Unintentionally, or whether<br>born of his intercourse with others. Yavakriti, Raivya, Arvavasu,<br>Paravasu, Ausija, Kashivat, and Vala have been said to be the sons of<br>Angiras. These, and Kanwa son of Rishi Medhatithi, and Varhishada, and<br>the well-known seven Rishis who are the progenitors of the three worlds,<br>all reside in the East. Unmucha, Vimucha, Svastyatreya of great energy,<br>Pramucha, Idhmavaha, and the divine Dridhavrata, and Mitravaruna's son<br>Agastya of great energy, these regenerate Rishis all reside in the south.<br>Upangu, Karusha, Dhaumya, Parivyadha of great energy, and those great<br>Rishis called Ekata, Dwita, and Trita, and Atri's son, viz., the<br>illustrious and puissant Saraswata, these high-souled ones reside in the<br>west. Atreya, and Vasishtha, and the great Rishi Kasyapa, and Gautama,<br>Bharadwaja, and Viswamitra, the son of Kusika, and the illustrious son of<br>the high-souled Richika, viz., Jamadagni,&#8212;these seven live in the north.<br>Thus have I told thee about the great Rishis of fiery energy that live in<br>the different points of the compass. Those high-souled ones are the<br>witnesses of the universe, and are the creators of all the worlds. Even<br>thus do they dwell in their respective quarters. By reciting their names<br>one is cleansed of all one's sins. A person by repairing to those points<br>becomes cleansed of all his sins and succeeds in returning home in<br>safety'"
