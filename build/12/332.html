                            "'Narada said, When the vicissitudes of happiness and sorrow appear or<br>disappear, the transitions are incapable of being prevented by either<br>wisdom or policy or exertion. Without allowing oneself to fall away from<br>one's true nature, one should strive one's best for protecting one's own<br>Self. He who betakes himself to such care and exertion, has never to<br>languish. Regarding Self as something dear, one should always seek to<br>rescue oneself from decrepitude, death, and disease. Mental and physical<br>diseases afflict the body, like keen-pointed shafts shot from the bow by<br>a strong bowman. The body of a person that is tortured by thirst, that is<br>agitated by agony, that is perfectly helpless, and that is desirous of<br>prolonging his life, is dragged towards destruction.[1769] Days and<br>nights are ceaselessly running bearing away in their current the periods<br>of life of all human beings. Like currents of rivers, these flow<br>ceaselessly without ever turning back.[1770] The ceaseless succession of<br>the lighted and the dark fortnights is wasting all mortal creatures<br>without stopping for even a moment in this work. Rising and setting day<br>after day, the Sun, who is himself undecaying, is continually cooking the<br>joys and sorrows of all men. The nights are ceaselessly going away,<br>taking with them the good and bad incidents that befall man, that depend<br>on destiny, and that are unexpected by him. If the fruits of man's acts<br>were not dependent on other circumstances, then one would obtain whatever<br>object one would desire. Even men of restrained senses, of cleverness,<br>and of intelligence, if destitute of acts, never succeed in earning any<br>fruits.[1771] Others, though destitute of intelligence and unendued with<br>accomplishments of any kind, and who are really the lowest of men, are<br>seen, even when they do not long after success, to be crowned with the<br>fruition of all their desires.[1772] Some one else, who is always ready<br>to do acts of injury to all creatures, and who is engaged in deceiving<br>all the world, is seen to wallow in happiness. Some one that sits idly,<br>obtains great prosperity; while another, by exerting earnestly, is seen<br>to miss desirable fruits almost within his reach.[1773] Do thou ascribe<br>it as one of the faults of man! The vital seed, originating in one's<br>nature from sight of one person, goes to another person. When imparted to<br>the womb, it sometimes produces an embryo and sometimes fails. When<br>sexual congress fails, it resembles a mango tree that puts forth a great<br>many flowers without, however, producing a single fruit.[1774] As regards<br>some men who are desirous of having offspring and who, for the fruition<br>of their object, strive heartily (by worshipping diverse deities), they<br>fail to procreate an embryo in the womb. Some person again, who fears the<br>birth of an embryo as one fears a snake of virulent poison, finds a<br>long-lived son born unto him and who seems to be his own self come back<br>to the stages through which he has passed. Many persons with ardent<br>longing for offspring and cheerless on that account, after sacrificing to<br>many deities and undergoing severe austerities, at last beget children,<br>duly borne for ten long months (in the wombs of their spouses), that<br>prove to be veritable wretches of their race. Others, who have been<br>obtained through virtue of such blessed rites and observances, at once<br>obtain wealth and grain and diverse other sources of enjoyment earned and<br>stored by their sires. In an act of congress, when two persons of<br>opposite sexes come into contact with one another, the embryo takes birth<br>in the womb, like a calamity afflicting the mother. Very soon after the<br>suspension of the vital breaths, other physical forms possess that<br>embodied creature whose gross body has been destroyed but whose acts have<br>all been performed with that gross body made of flesh and phlegm.[1775]<br>Upon the dissolution of the body, another body, which is as much<br>destructible as the one that is destroyed, is kept ready for the burnt<br>and destroyed creature (to migrate into) even as one boat goes to another<br>for transferring to itself the passengers of the other.[1776] In<br>consequence of an act of congress, a drop of the vital seed, that is<br>inanimate, is cast into the womb. I ask thee, through whose or what care<br>is the embryo kept alive? That part of the body into which the food that<br>is eaten goes and where it is digested, is the place where the embryo<br>resides, but it is not digested there. In the womb, amid urine and<br>faeces, one's sojourn is regulated by Nature. In the matter of residence<br>therein or escape therefrom, the born creature is not a free agent. In<br>fact, in these respects, he is perfectly helpless. Some embryos fall from<br>the womb (in an undeveloped state). Some come out alive (and continue to<br>live). While as regards some, they meet with destruction in the womb,<br>after being quickened with life, in consequence of some other bodies<br>being ready for them (through the nature of their acts).[1777] That man<br>who, in an act of sexual congress, injects the vital fluid, obtains from<br>it a son or daughter. The offspring thus obtained, when the time comes,<br>takes part in a similar act of congress. When the allotted period of a<br>person's life is at its close, the five primal elements of his body<br>attain to the seventh and the ninth stages and then cease to be. The<br>person, however, undergoes no change.[1778] Without doubt, when persons<br>are afflicted by diseases as little animals assailed by hunters, they<br>then lose the powers of rising up and moving about. If when men are<br>afflicted by diseases, they wish to spend even vast wealth, physicians<br>with their best efforts fail to alleviate their pain. Even physicians,<br>that are well-skilled and well-up in their scriptures and well-equipt<br>with excellent medicines, are themselves afflicted by disease like<br>animals assailed by hunters. Even if men drink many astringents and<br>diverse kinds of medicated ghee, they are seen to be broken by<br>decrepitude like trees by strong elephants. When animals and birds and<br>beasts of prey and poor men are afflicted by ailments, who treats them<br>with medicines? Indeed, these are not seen to be ill. Like larger animals<br>assailing smaller ones, ailments are seen to afflict even terrible kings<br>of fierce energy and invincible prowess. All men, reft of the power of<br>even uttering cries indicate of pain, and overwhelmed by error and grief,<br>are seen to be borne away along the fierce current into which they have<br>been thrown. Embodied creatures, even when seeking to conquer nature, are<br>unable to conquer it with the aid of wealth, of sovereign power, or of<br>the austerest penances.[1779] If all attempts men make were crowned with<br>success, then men would never be subject to decrepitude, would never come<br>upon anything disagreeable, and lastly would be crowned with fruition in<br>respect of all their wishes. All men wish to attain to gradual<br>superiority of position. To gratify this wish they strive to the best of<br>their power. The result, however, does not agree with wish.[1780] Even<br>men that are perfectly heedful, that are honest, and brave and endued<br>with prowess, are seen to pay their adorations to men intoxicated with<br>the pride of affluence and with even alcoholic stimulants.[1781] Some men<br>are seen whose calamities disappear before even these are marked or<br>noticed by them. Others there are who are seen to possess no wealth but<br>who are free from misery of every kind. A great disparity is observable<br>in respect of the fruits that wait upon conjunctions of acts. Some are<br>seen to bear vehicles on their shoulders, while some are seen to ride on<br>those vehicles. All men are desirous of affluence and prosperity. A few<br>only have cars (and elephants and steeds) dragged (or walking) in their<br>processions. Some there are that fail to have a single spouse when their<br>first-wedded ones are dead; while others have hundreds of spouses to call<br>their own. Misery and happiness are the two things that exist side by<br>side. Men have either misery or happiness. Behold, this is a subject of<br>wonder! Do not, however, suffer thyself to be stupefied by error at such<br>a sight! Cast off both righteousness and sin! Cast off also truth and<br>falsehood! Having cast off truth and falsehood, do thou then cast off<br>that with whose aid thou shalt cast off the former! O best of Rishis, I<br>have now told thee that which is a great misery! With the aid of such<br>instructions, the deities (who were all human beings) succeeded in<br>leaving the Earth for becoming the denizens of heaven!<br><br>"'Hearing these words of Narada Suka, endued with great intelligence and<br>possessed of tranquillity of mind, reflected upon the drift of the<br>instructions he received, but could not arrive at any certainty of<br>conclusion. He understood that one suffers great misery in consequence of<br>the accession of children and spouses; that one has to undergo great<br>labour for the acquisition of science and Vedic lore. He, therefore,<br>asked himself, saying,&#8212;What is that situation which is eternal and which<br>is free from misery of every kind but in which there is great<br>prosperity?&#8212;Reflecting for a moment upon the course ordained for him to<br>run through, Suka, who was well acquainted with the beginning and the end<br>of all duties, resolved to attain to the highest end that is fraught with<br>the greatest felicity. He questioned himself, saying,&#8212;How shall I,<br>tearing all attachments and becoming perfectly free, attain to that<br>excellent end? How, indeed, shall I attain to that excellent situation<br>whence there is no return into the ocean of diverse kinds of birth! I<br>desire to obtain that condition of existence whence there is no return!<br>Casting off all kinds of attachments, arrived at certainty by reflection<br>with the aid of the mind, I shall attain to that end! I shall attain to<br>that situation in which thy Soul will nave tranquillity, and when I shall<br>be able to dwell for eternity without being subject to decrepitude or<br>change. It is, however, certain that that high end cannot be attained<br>without the aid of Yoga. One that has attained to the state of perfect<br>knowledge and enlightenment never receives an accession of low<br>attachments through acts.[1782] I shall, therefore, have recourse to<br>Yoga, and casting off this body which is my present residence, I shall<br>transform myself into wind and enter that mass of effulgence which is<br>represented by the sin.[1783] When Jiva enters that mass of effulgence,<br>he no longer suffers like Shoma who, with the gods, upon the exhaustion<br>of merit, falls down on the Earth and having once more acquired<br>sufficient merit returns to heavens.[1784] The moon is always seen to<br>wane and once more wax. Seeing this waning and waxing that go on<br>repeatedly, I do not wish to have a form of existence in which there are<br>such changes. The Sun warms all the worlds by means of his fierce rays.<br>His disc never undergoes any diminution. Remaining unchanged, he drinks<br>energy from all things. Hence, I desire to go into the Sun of blazing<br>effulgence.[1785] There I shall live, invincible by all, and in my inner<br>soul freed from all fear, having cast off this body of mine in the solar<br>region. With the great Rishis I shall enter the unbearable energy of the<br>Sun. I declare unto all creatures, unto these trees, these elephants,<br>these mountains, the Earth herself, the several points of the compass,<br>the welkin, the deities, the Danavas, the Gandharvas, the Pisachas, the<br>Uragas, and the Rakshasas, that I shall, verily, enter all creatures in<br>the world.[1786] Let all the gods with the Rishis behold the prowess of<br>my Yoga today!&#8212;Having said these words, Suka, informed Narada of world<br>wide celebrity of his intention. Obtaining Narada's permission, Suka then<br>proceeded to where his sire was. Arrived at his presence, the great Muni,<br>viz., the high-souled and Island-born Krishna, Suka walked round him and<br>addressed him the usual enquiries. Hearing of Suka's intention, the<br>highsouled Rishi became highly pleased. Addressing him, the great Rishi<br>said,&#8212;O son, O dear son, do thou stay here to-day so that I may behold<br>thee for some time for gratifying my eyes,&#8212;Suka, however, was<br>indifferent to that request. Freed from affection and all doubt, he began<br>to think only of Emancipation, and set his heart on the journey. Leaving<br>his sire, that foremost of Rishis then proceeded to the spacious breast<br>of Kailasa which was inhabited by crowds of ascetics crowned with<br>success.'"
