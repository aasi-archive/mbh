                            Vaisampayana said, "The righteous-souled Yudhishthira, with an agitated<br>heart and burning with sorrow, began to grieve for that mighty<br>car-warrior Karna. Sighing repeatedly, he addressed Arjuna, saying, 'If,<br>O Arjuna, we had led a life of mendicancy in the cities of the Vrishnis<br>and the Andhakas, then this miserable end would not have been ours in<br>consequence of having exterminated our kinsmen. Our foes, the Kurus, have<br>gained in prosperity, while we have become divested of all the objects of<br>life, for what fruits of righteousness can be ours when we have been<br>guilty of self-slaughter?[4] Fie on the usages of Kshatriyas, fie on<br>might and valour, and fie on wrath, since through these such a calamity<br>hath overtaken us. Blessed are forgiveness, and self-restraint, and<br>purity, with renunciation and humility, and abstention from injury, and<br>truthfulness of speech on all occasions, which are all practised by<br>forest-recluses. Full of pride and arrogance, ourselves, however, through<br>covetousness and folly and from desire of enjoying the sweets of<br>sovereignty, have fallen into this plight. Beholding those kinsmen of<br>ours that were bent on acquiring the sovereignty of the world slain on<br>the field of battle, such grief hath been ours that one cannot gladden us<br>by giving the sovereignty of even the three worlds. Alas, having slain,<br>for the sake of the earth, such lords of earth as deserved not to be<br>slain by us, we are bearing the weight of existence, deprived of friends<br>and reft of the very objects of life. Like a pack of dogs fighting one<br>another for a piece of meat, a great disaster has overtaken us! That<br>piece of meat is no longer dear to us. On the other hand, it shall be<br>thrown aside. They that have been slain should not have been slain for<br>the sake of even the whole earth or mountains of gold, or all the horses<br>and kine in this world. Filled with envy and a hankering for all earthly<br>objects, and influenced by wrath and pleasure, all of them, betaking<br>themselves to the highway of Death, have repaired to the regions of Yama.<br>Practising asceticism and Brahmacharya and truth and renunciation, sires<br>wish for sons endued with every kind of prosperity. Similarly, by fasts<br>and sacrifices and vows and sacred rites and auspicious ceremonies<br>mothers conceive. They then hold the foetus for ten months. Passing their<br>time in misery and in expectation of fruit, they always ask themselves in<br>anxiety, 'Shall these come out of the womb safely? Shall these live after<br>birth? Shall they grow in might and be objects of regard on earth? Shall<br>they be able to give us happiness in this and the other world?' Alas,<br>since their sons, youthful in years and resplendent with ear-rings, have<br>been slain, therefore, those expectations of theirs rendered fruitless,<br>have been abandoned by them. Without having enjoyed the pleasure of this<br>world, and without having paid off the debts they owed to their sires and<br>the gods, they have repaired to Yama's abode. Alas, O mother, those kings<br>have been slain just at that time when their parents expected to reap the<br>fruits of their might and wealth.[5] They were always fitted with envy<br>and a hankering after earthly objects, and were exceedingly subject to<br>anger and joy. For this, they could not be expected to enjoy at any time<br>or any place the fruits of victory.[6] I think that they among the<br>Panchalas and the Kurus that have fallen (in this battle) have been lost,<br>otherwise he that has slain would, by that act of his, obtain all regions<br>of bliss.[7] We are regarded as the cause of the destruction that has<br>overtaken the world. The fault, however, is really ascribable to the sons<br>of Dhritarashtra. Duryodhana's heart was always set upon guile. Always<br>cherishing malice, he was addicted to deception. Although we never<br>offended him, yet he always behaved falsely towards us. We have not<br>gained our object, nor have they gained theirs. We have not vanquished<br>them, nor have they vanquished us. The Dhartarashtras could not enjoy<br>this earth, nor could they enjoy women and music. They did not listen to<br>the counsels of ministers and friends and men learned in the scriptures.<br>They could not, indeed, enjoy their costly gems and well-filled treasury<br>and vast territories. Burning with the hate they bore us, they could not<br>obtain happiness and peace. Beholding our aggrandisement, Duryodhana<br>became colourless, pale and emaciated. Suvala's son informed king<br>Dhritarashtra of this. As a father full of affection for his son,<br>Dhritarashtra tolerated the evil policy his son pursued. Without doubt,<br>by disregarding Vidura and the high-souled son of Ganga, and in<br>consequence of his neglect in restraining his wicked and covetous son,<br>entirely governed by his passions, the king has met with destruction like<br>my poor self. Without doubt, Suyodhana, having caused his uterine<br>brothers to be slain and having east this couple into burning grief, hath<br>fallen off from his blazing fame. Burning with the hate he bore to us<br>Duryodhana was always of a sinful heart. What other kinsman of high birth<br>could use such language towards kinsmen as he, from desire of battle,<br>actually used in the presence of Krishna? We also have, through<br>Duryodhana's fault, been lost for eternity, like suns burning everything<br>around them with their own energy. That wicked-souled wight, that<br>embodiment of hostility, was our evil star. Alas, for Duryodhana's acts<br>alone, this race of ours has been exterminated. Having slain those whom<br>we should never have slain, we have incurred the censures of the world.<br>King Dhritarashtra, having installed that wicked-souled prince of sinful<br>deeds, that exterminator of his race, in the sovereignty, is obliged to<br>grieve today. Our heroic foes have been slain. We have committed sin. His<br>possessions and kingdom are gone. Having slain them, our wrath has been<br>pacified. But grief is stupefying me. O Dhananjaya, a perpetrated sin is<br>expiated by auspicious acts, by publishing it wildly, by repentance, by<br>alms-giving, by penances, by trips to tirthas after renunciation of<br>everything, by constant meditation on the scriptures. Of all these, he<br>that has practised renunciation is believed to be incapable of committing<br>sins anew. The Srutis declare that he that practises renunciation escapes<br>from birth and death, and obtaining the right rood, that person of fixed<br>soul attains to Brahma. I shall, therefore, O Dhananjaya, go to the<br>woods, with your leave, O scorcher of foes, disregarding all the pairs of<br>opposites, adopting the vow of taciturnity, and walking in the way<br>pointed out by knowledge.[8] O slayer of foes, the Srutis declare it and<br>I myself have seen it with my eyes, that one who is wedded to this earth<br>can never obtain every kind Of religious merit. Desirous of obtaining the<br>things of this earth, I have committed sin, through which, as the Srutis<br>declare, birth and death are brought about. Abandoning the whole of my<br>kingdom, therefore, and the things of this earth, I shall go to the<br>woods, escaping from the ties of the world, freed from grief, and without<br>affection for anything. Do thou govern this earth, on which peace has<br>been restored, and which has been divested of all its thorns. O best of<br>Kuru's race, I have no need for kingdom or for pleasure.' Having said<br>these words, king Yudhishthira the just stopped. His younger brother<br>Arjuna then addressed him in the following words.
