                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O holy and great ascetic, I desire to hear in detail<br>what the duties of kings are and what the duties, in full, of all the<br>four orders. I desire also to hear, O foremost of Brahmanas, what<br>behaviour should be adopted in seasons of distress, and how I may<br>subjugate the world by treading along the path of morality. This<br>discourse on expiation, treating (at the same time) of fasts and capable<br>of exciting great curiosity, fills me with joy. The practice of virtue<br>and the discharge of kingly duties are always inconsistent with each<br>other. For always thinking of how one may reconcile the two, my mind is<br>constantly stupefied.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Vyasa, O monarch, that foremost of all<br>persons conversant with the Vedas, casting his eyes upon that ancient and<br>all-knowing person, viz., Narada, said, If, O king, thou wishest to hear<br>of duties and morality in full, then ask Bhishma, O mighty-armed one,<br>that old grandsire of the Kurus. Conversant with all duties and possessed<br>of universal knowledge, that son of Bhagirathi will remove all the doubts<br>in thy heart on the difficult subject of duties. That goddess, viz., the<br>genius of the celestial river of three courses brought him forth. He saw<br>with his physical eyes all the gods with Indra at their head. Having<br>gratified with his dutiful services the celestial Rishis having<br>Vrihaspati at their head, he acquired a knowledge of the duties of kings.<br>That foremost one among the Kurus obtained a knowledge also of that<br>science, with its interpretations, with Usanas and that regenerate one<br>who is the preceptor of the celestials know. Having practised rigid vows,<br>that mighty-armed one acquired a knowledge of all the Vedas and their<br>branches, from Vasishtha and from Chyavana of Bhrigu's race. In olden<br>days he studied under the eldest-born son of the Grandsire himself, viz.,<br>Sanatkumara of blazing splendour, well conversant with the truths of<br>mental and spiritual science. He learnt the duties in full of the Yatis<br>from the lips of Markandeya. The bull among men obtained all weapons from<br>Rama and Sakra. Although born among human beings, his death itself is<br>still under his own control. Although childless, yet he has many regions<br>of bliss hereafter as heard by us. Regenerate Rishis of great merit were<br>always his courtiers. There is nothing among objects that should be known<br>that is unknown to him. Conversant with all duties and acquainted with<br>all the subtle truths of morality, even he will discourse to thee upon<br>duty and morality. Go unto him before he abandons his life breath. Thus<br>addressed by him, the high-souled son of Kunti, of great wisdom, said the<br>following words unto Satyavati's son Vyasa, that first of eloquent men.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Having caused a great and horrid slaughter of<br>kinsmen, I have become an offender against all and a destroyer of the<br>earth. Having caused that Bhishma himself, that warrior who always fought<br>fairly, to be slain by the aid of deceit, how shall I approach him for<br>asking him (about duties and morality)?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Moved by the desire of benefiting all the four<br>orders, the mighty armed and high-souled chief of Yadu's race once more<br>addressed that foremost of kings (in the following words).'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'It behoveth thee not to show such pertinacity in grief.<br>Do that, O best of kings, which the holy Vyasa has said. The Brahmanas, O<br>mighty-armed one, and these thy brothers of great energy, stand before<br>thee beseechingly like persons beseeching the deity of the clouds at the<br>close of summer. The unslain remnant of the assembled kings, and the<br>people belonging to all the four orders of thy kingdom of Kurujangala, O<br>king, are here. For the sake of doing what is agreeable to these<br>high-souled Brahmanas, in obedience also to the command of thy revered<br>senior Vyasa of immeasurable energy, and at the request of out-selves<br>that are thy well-wishers, and of Draupadi, O scorcher of foes, do what<br>is agreeable to us, O slayer of foes, and what is beneficial to the<br>world.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued. 'Thus addressed by Krishna, the high-souled king<br>(Yudhishthira) of eyes like lotus petals, rose from his seat for the good<br>of the whole world. The tiger among men, viz., Yudhishthira of great<br>fame, besought by Krishna himself, by the Island-born (Vyasa), by<br>Devasthana, by Jishnu, by these and many others, cast off his grief and<br>anxiety. Fully conversant with the declarations of the Srutis, with the<br>science that treats of the interpretation of those declarations, and with<br>all that men usually hear and all that deserve to be heard, the son of<br>Pandu obtained peace of mind and resolved upon that he should next do.<br>Surrounded by all of them like the moon by the stars, the king, placing<br>Dhritarashtra at the head of the train, set out for entering the city.<br>Desirous of entering the city, Kunti's son Yudhishthira, conversant with<br>every duty, offered worship unto the gods and thousands of Brahmanas. He<br>then ascended a new and white car covered with blankets and deerskins,<br>and unto which were yoked sixteen white bullocks possessed of auspicious<br>marks, and which had been sanctified with Vedic mantras. Adored by<br>panegyrists and bards, the king mounted upon that car like Soma riding<br>upon his own ambrosial vehicle. His brother Bhima of terrible prowess<br>took the reins. Arjuna held over his head a white umbrella of great<br>effulgence. That white umbrella held upon the car looked beautiful like a<br>star-decked white cloud in the firmament. The two heroic sons of Madri,<br>viz., Nakula and Sahadeva, took up two yak-tails white as the rays of the<br>moon and adorned with gems for fanning the king. The five brothers decked<br>with ornaments, having ascended the car, O king, looked like the five<br>elements (that enter into the composition of everybody). Riding upon<br>another white car unto which were yoked steeds fleet as thought, Yuyutsu,<br>O king, followed the eldest son of Pandu behind. Upon his own brilliant<br>car of gold unto which were yoked Saivya and Sugriva, Krishna, with<br>Satyaki, followed the Kurus. The eldest uncle of Pritha's son, O Bharata,<br>accompanied by Gandhari, proceeded at the head of the train, upon a<br>vehicle borne on the shoulders of men. The other ladies of the Kuru<br>household, as also Kunti and Krishna, all proceeded on excellent<br>vehicles, headed by Vidura. Behind followed a large number of cars and<br>elephants decked with ornaments, and foot-soldiers and steeds. His<br>praises chanted by sweet-voiced panegyrists and bards, the king proceeded<br>towards the city called after the elephant. The progress, O mighty-armed<br>one, of king Yudhishthira, became so beautiful that its like had never<br>been on earth. Teeming with healthy and cheerful men, thy busy hum of<br>innumerable voices was heard there. During the progress of Pritha's son,<br>the city and its streets were adorned with gay citizens (all of whom had<br>come out for honouring the king). The spot through which the king passed<br>had been decked with festoons of flowers and innumerable banners. The<br>streets of the city were perfumed with incense. The place was overlaid<br>with powdered perfumes and flowers and fragrant plants, and hung over<br>with garlands and wreaths. New metallic jars, full of water to the brim,<br>were kept at the door of every house, and bevies of beautiful maidens of<br>the fairest complexion stood at the particular spots. Accompanied by his<br>friends, the son of Pandu, adored with sweet speeches, entered the city<br>through its well-adorned gate.'"
