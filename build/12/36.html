                            "Vyasa said, 'By penances, religious rites, and gifts, O Bharata, a man<br>may wash off his sins if he does not commit them again. By subsisting<br>upon only one meal a day, and that procured by mendicancy, by doing all<br>his acts himself (without relying on the aid of a servant), by making his<br>round of mendicancy with a human skull in one hand and a khattanga in<br>another, by becoming a Brahmacharin and always ready for exertion, by<br>casting off all malice, by sleeping on the bare ground, by publishing his<br>offence to the world, by doing all this for full twelve years, a person<br>can cleanse himself from the sin of having slain a Brahmana. By perishing<br>upon the weapon of a person living by the use of arms, of one's own will<br>and upon the advice of persons learned in the scriptures, or by throwing<br>one's self down, for three times, with head downwards, upon a blazing<br>fire, or by walking a hundred Yojanas all the while reciting the Vedas,<br>or by giving away one's whole property to a Brahmana conversant with the<br>Vedas, or at least so much as would secure to him a competence for life,<br>or a house properly furnished, and by protecting kine and Brahmanas, one<br>may be cleansed of the sin of having slain a Brahmana. By living upon the<br>scantiest meal every day for a space of six years, a person may be<br>cleansed of that sin.[115] By observing a harder vow with regard to food<br>one may be cleansed in three years.[116] By living upon one meal a month,<br>one may be cleansed in course of only a year. By observing, again, an<br>absolute fast, one may be cleansed within a very short time. There is no<br>doubt again that: one is cleansed by a Horse-sacrifice. Men that have<br>been guilty of having slain a Brahmana and that have succeeded in taking<br>the final bath at the completion of the Horse-sacrifice, become cleansed<br>of all their sins. This is an injunction of great authority in the<br>Srutis. One again, by slaying down his life in a battle undertaken for<br>the sake of a Brahmana, becomes cleansed of the sin of having slain a<br>Brahmana. By giving away a hundred thousand kine unto persons deserving<br>of gifts, one becomes cleansed of the sin of having slain a Brahmana as<br>also, indeed, of all his sins. One that gives away five and twenty<br>thousand kine of the Kapila species and while all of them have calved,<br>becomes cleansed of all his sins. One who, at the point of death, gives<br>away a thousand kine with calves unto poor but deserving persons, becomes<br>freed from sin. That man, O king, who gives away a hundred steeds of the<br>Kamvoja breed unto Brahmanas of regulated behaviour, becomes freed from<br>sin. That man. O Bharata, who gives unto even one person all that he asks<br>for, and who, having given it, does not speak of his act to any one,<br>becomes freed from sin. If a person who has once taken alcohol drinks (as<br>expiation) hot liquor, he sanctifies himself both here and hereafter. By<br>falling from the summit of a mountain or entering a blazing fire, or by<br>going on an everlasting journey after renouncing the world, one is freed<br>from all sins. By performing the sacrifice laid down by Vrihaspati, a<br>Brahmana who drinks alcoholic liquors may succeed in attaining to the<br>region of Brahman. This has been said by Brahman himself. If a person,<br>after having drunk alcoholic liquor, becomes humble and makes a gift of<br>land, and abstains from it ever afterwards, he becomes sanctified and<br>cleansed. The person that has violated his preceptor's bed, should lie<br>down on a sheet of iron having heated it, and having cut off the emblem<br>of his sex should leave the world for a life in the woods, with eyes<br>always turned upwards. By casting off one's body, one becomes cleansed of<br>all his evil acts. Women, by leading a regulated life for one year,<br>become cleansed of all their sins. The person who observes a very rigid<br>vow, or gives away the whole of his wealth, or perishes in a battle<br>fought for the sake of his preceptor, becomes cleansed of all his sins.<br>One who uses falsehood before one's preceptor or acts in opposition to<br>him, becomes cleansed of that sin by doing something agreeable to one's<br>preceptor. One who has fallen off from the vow (of Brahmacharya ), may<br>become cleansed of that sin by wearing the hide of a cow for six months<br>and observing the penances laid down in the case of the slaughter of a<br>Brahmana. One who has been guilty of adultery, or of theft, may become<br>cleansed by observing rigid vows for a year. When one steals another's<br>property, one should, by every means in his power, return to that other<br>property of the value of what has been stolen. One may then be cleansed<br>of the sin (of theft). The younger brother who has married before the<br>marriage of the elder brother, as also the elder brother whose Younger<br>brother has married before him, becomes cleansed by observing a rigid<br>vow, with collected soul, for twelve nights. The younger brother,<br>however, should wed again for rescuing his deceased ancestors. Upon such<br>second wedding, the first wife becomes cleansed and her husband himself<br>would not incur sin by taking her. Men conversant with the scriptures<br>declare that women may be cleansed of even the greatest sins by observing<br>the vow of chaturmasya, all the while living upon scanty and cleansing<br>food. Persons conversant with the scriptures do not take into account the<br>sins that women may commit at heart. Whatever their sins (of this<br>description), they are cleansed by their menstrual course like a metallic<br>plate that is scoured with ashes. Plates (made of the alloy of brass and<br>copper) stained by a Sudra eating off it, or a vessel of the same metal<br>that has been smelt by a cow, or stained by a Brahmana's Gandusha, may be<br>cleansed by means of the ten purifying substances.[117] It has been laid<br>down that a Brahmana should acquire and practise the full measure of<br>virtue. For a person at the kingly order it has been laid down that he<br>should acquire and practise a measure of virtue less by a fourth part.<br>So, a Vaisya should acquire a measure less (than a Kshatriya's) by a<br>fourth and a Sudra less (than a Vaisya's) by a fourth. The heaviness or<br>lightness of sins (for purposes of expiation) of each of the four orders,<br>should be determined upon this principle. Having slain a bird or an<br>animal, or cut down living trees, a person should publish his sin and<br>fast for three nights. By having intercourse with one with whom<br>intercourse is prohibited, the expiation for one is wandering in wet<br>clothes and sleeping on a bed of ashes. These, O king, are the expiations<br>for sinful acts, according to precedent and reason and scriptures and the<br>ordinances. A Brahmana may be cleansed of all sins by reciting the<br>Gayatri in a sacred place, all the while living upon frugal fare, casting<br>off malice, abandoning wrath and hate, unmoved by praise and blame, and<br>abstaining from speech. He should during the day-time be under shelter of<br>the sky and should lie down at night even at such a place. Thrice during<br>the day, and thrice during the night, he should also plunge with his<br>clothes into a stream or lake for performing his ablutions. Observant of<br>rigid vows, he should abstain from speech with women, Sudras, and fallen<br>persons. A Brahmana by observing such regulations may be cleansed of all<br>sins unconsciously committed by him. A person obtains in the other world<br>the fruits, good or bad, of his acts here which are all witnessed by the<br>elements. Be it virtue or be it vice, according to the true measure that<br>one acquires of either, one enjoys or suffers the consequences (even<br>here). By knowledge, by penances, and by righteous acts, therefore, one<br>enhances his weal (even here). One, therefore may similarly enhance his<br>misery by committing unrighteous acts. One should, therefore, always<br>achieve acts that are righteous and abstain altogether from those that<br>are unrighteous. I have now indicated what the expiations are of the sins<br>that have been mentioned. There is expiation for every sin except those<br>that are called Mahapatakas (highly heinous sins). As regards sins in<br>respect of unclean food and the like, and improper speeches, etc., they<br>are of two classes, viz., those committed consciously and those that are<br>committed unconsciously. All sins that are committed consciously are<br>grave, while those that are committed unconsciously are trivial or light.<br>There is expiation for both. Indeed sin is capable of being washed away<br>by (observance of) the ordinances spoken of. Those ordinances, however,<br>have been laid down only for believers (in God) and those that have<br>faith. They are not for atheists or those that have no faith, or those in<br>whom pride and malice predominate. A person, O tiger among men, that is<br>desirous of weal both here and hereafter, should, O foremost of virtuous<br>men, have recourse to righteous behaviour, to (the counsels of) men that<br>are righteous, and to the duties that have been ordained for him.<br>Therefore, for the reasons already advanced (by me), thou, O king, shalt<br>be cleansed of all thy sins for thou hast slain thy foes in the discharge<br>of thy duties as a king and for the protection of thy life-breath and thy<br>inheritance. Or, if not withstanding this, thou still regardest thyself<br>to be sinful, perform expiation. Do not cast away thy life in consequence<br>of such grief that is not becoming a wise man.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by the holy Rishi, king<br>Yudhishthira the just, having reflected for a short while, said these<br>words unto the sage.'"
