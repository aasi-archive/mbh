                            "'Narada said, By listening to such scriptures as are blessed, as bring<br>about tranquillity, as dispel grief, and as are productive of happiness,<br>one attains to (a pure) understanding, and having attained to it obtains<br>to high 'felicity. A thousand causes of sorrow, a hundred causes of fear,<br>from day to day, afflict one that is destitute of understanding, but not<br>one that is possessed of wisdom and learning. Do thou, therefore, listen<br>to some old narratives as I recite them to you, for the object of<br>dispelling thy griefs. If one can subjugate one's understanding, one is<br>sure to attain to happiness. By association of what is undesirable and<br>dissociation from what is agreeable, only men of little intelligence,<br>become subject to mental sorrow of every kind. When things have become<br>past, one should not grieve, thinking of their merits. He that thinks of<br>such past things with affection can never emancipate himself. One should<br>always seek to find out the faults of those things to which one begins to<br>become attached. One should always regard such things to be fraught with<br>much evil. By doing so, one should soon free oneself therefrom. The man<br>who grieves for what is past fails to acquire either wealth or religious<br>merit or fame. That which exists no longer cannot be obtained. When such<br>things pass away, they do not return (however keen the regret one may<br>indulge in for their sake). Creatures sometimes acquire and sometimes<br>lose worldly object. No man in this world can be grieved by all the<br>events that fall upon him. Dead or lost, he who grieves for what is past,<br>only gets sorrow for sorrow. Instead of one sorrow, he gets two.[1763]<br>Those men who, beholding the course of life and death in the world with<br>the aid of their intelligence, do not shed tears, are said to behold<br>properly. Such persons have never to shed tears, (at anything that may<br>happen). When any such calamity comes, productive of either physical or<br>mental grief, as is incapable of being warded off by even one's best<br>efforts, one should cease to reflect on it with sorrow. This is the<br>medicine for sorrow, viz., not to think of it. By thinking of it, one can<br>never dispel it; on the other hand, by thinking upon sorrow, one only<br>enhances it. Mental griefs should be killed by wisdom; while physical<br>grief should be dispelled by medicines. This is the power of knowledge.<br>One should not, in such matters, behave like men of little<br>understandings. Youth, beauty, life, stored wealth, health, association<br>with those that are loved,&#8212;these all are exceedingly transitory. One<br>possessed of wisdom should never covet them. One should not lament<br>individually for a sorrowful occurrence that concerns an entire<br>community. Instead of indulgence in it when grief comes, one should seek<br>to avert it and apply a remedy as soon as one sees the opportunity for<br>doing it. There is no doubt that in this life the measure of misery is<br>much greater than that of happiness. There is no doubt in this that all<br>men show attachment for objects of the senses and that death is regarded<br>as disagreeable. That man who casts off both joy and sorrow, is said to<br>attain to Brahma. When such a man departs from this world, men of wisdom<br>never indulge in any sorrow on his account. In spending wealth there is<br>pain. In protecting it there is pain. In acquiring it there is pain.<br>Hence, when one's wealth meets with destruction, one should not indulge<br>in any sorrow for it. Men of little understanding, attaining to different<br>grades of wealth, fail to win contentment and at last perish in misery.<br>Men of wisdom, however, are always contented. All combinations are<br>destined to end in dissolution. All things that are high are destined to<br>fall down and become low. Union is sure to end in disunion anti life is<br>certain to end in death. Thirst is unquenchable. Contentment is the<br>highest happiness. Hence, persons of wisdom regard contentment to be the<br>most precious wealth. One's allotted period of life is running<br>continually. It stops not in its course for even a single moment. When<br>one's body itself is not durable, what other thing is there (in this<br>world) that one should reckon as durable? Those persons who, reflecting<br>on the nature of all creatures and concluding that it is beyond the grasp<br>of the mind, turn their attention to the highest path, and, setting out,<br>achieve a fair progress in it, have not to indulge in sorrow.[1764] Like<br>a tiger seizing and running away with its prey, Death seizes and runs<br>away with the man that is employed in such (unprofitable) occupation and<br>that is still unsatiated with objects of desire and enjoyment. One should<br>always seek to emancipate oneself from sorrow. One should seek to dispel<br>sorrow by beginning one's operations with cheerfulness, that is, without<br>indulging in sorrow the while, having freed oneself from a particular<br>sorrow, one should act in such a way as to keep sorrow at a distance by<br>abstaining from all faults of conduct.[1765] The rich and the poor alike<br>find nothing in sound and touch and form and scent and taste, after the<br>immediate enjoyment thereof.[1766] Before union, creatures are never<br>subject to sorrow. Hence, one that has not fallen off from one's original<br>nature, never indulges in sorrow when that union comes to an end.[1767]<br>One should restrain one's sexual appetite and the stomach with the aid of<br>patience. One should protect one's hands and feet with the aid of the<br>eye. One's eyes and ears and the other senses should be protected by the<br>mind. One's mind and speech should be ruled with the aid of wisdom.<br>Casting off love and affection for persons that are known as well as for<br>those that are unknown, one should conduct oneself with humility. Such a<br>person is said to be possessed of wisdom, and such a one surely finds<br>happiness. That man who is pleased with his own Soul[1768] who is devoted<br>to Yoga, who depends upon nothing out of self, who is without cupidity,<br>and who conducts himself without the assistance of anything but his self,<br>succeeds in attaining to felicity.'"
