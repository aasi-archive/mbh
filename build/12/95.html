                            "Yudhishthira said, 'If a Kshatriya desires to subjugate another<br>Kshatriya in battle, how should the former act in the matter of that<br>victory? Questioned by me, do thou answer it.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The king, with or without an army at his back, entering<br>the dominions of the king he would subjugate, should say unto all the<br>people, 'I am your king. I shall always protect you. Give me the just<br>tribute or encounter me in battle.' If the people accept him for their<br>king, there need not be any fighting. If, without being Kshatriyas by<br>birth, they show signs of hostility, they should then, observant as they<br>are of practices not laid down for them, be sought to be restrained by<br>every means. People of the other orders do take up arms (for resisting<br>the invader) if they behold the Kshatriya unarmed for fight, incapable of<br>protecting himself, and making too much of the enemy.'[279]<br><br>"Yudhishthira said 'Tell me, O grandsire, how that Kshatriya king should<br>conduct himself in fight who advances against another Kshatriya king.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'A Kshatriya must not put on armour for fighting a<br>Kshatriya unclad in mail. One should fight one, and abandon the opponent<br>when the latter becomes disabled.[280] If the enemy comes clad in mail,<br>his opponent also should put on mail. If the enemy advances backed by an<br>army, one should, backed by an army, challenge him to battle. If the<br>enemy fights aided by deceit, he should be met with the aid of deceit.<br>If, on the other hand, he fights fairly, he should be resisted with fair<br>means. One should not on horseback proceed against a car-warrior. A<br>car-warrior should proceed against a car-warrior. When an antagonist has<br>fallen into distress, he should not be struck; nor should one that has<br>been frightened, nor one that has been vanquished.[281] Neither poisoned<br>nor barbed arrows should be used. These are the weapons of the wicked.<br>One should fight righteously, without yielding to wrath or desiring to<br>slay. A weak or wounded man should not be slain, or one that is sonless;<br>or one whose weapon has been broken; or one that has fallen into<br>distress; or one whose bow-string has been cut; or one that has lost his<br>vehicle. A wounded opponent should either be sent to his own home, or, if<br>brought to the victor's quarters, should have his wounds attended to by<br>skilful surgeons. When in consequence of a quarrel between righteous<br>kings, a righteous warrior falls into distress, (his wounds should be<br>attended to and) when cured he should be set at liberty. This is the<br>eternal duty. Manu himself, the son of the Self-born (Brahman), has said<br>that battles should be fought fairly. The righteous should always act<br>righteously towards those that are righteous. They should adhere to<br>righteousness without destroying it. If a Kshatriya, whose duty it is to<br>fight righteously, wins a victory by unrighteous means, he becomes<br>sinful. Of deceitful conduct, such a person is said to slay his own self.<br>Such is the practice of those that are wicked. Even he that is wicked<br>should be subdued by fair means. It is better to lay down life itself in<br>the observance of righteousness than to win victory by sinful means. Like<br>a cow, O king, perpetrated sin does not immediately produce its fruits.<br>That sin overwhelms the perpetrator after consuming his roots and<br>branches. A sinful person, acquiring wealth by sinful means, rejoices<br>greatly. But the sinner, gaining advancement by sinful ways, becomes<br>wedded to sin. Thinking that virtue has no efficacy, he jeers at men of<br>righteous behaviour. Disbelieving in virtue, he at last meets with<br>destruction. Though enmeshed in the noose of Varuna, he still regards<br>himself immortal. Like unto a large leathern bag puffed up with wind, the<br>sinner dissociates himself entirely from virtue. Soon, however, he<br>disappears like a tree on the riverside washed away with its very roots.<br>Then people, beholding him resemble an earthen pot broken on a stony<br>surface, speak of him as he deserves. The king should, therefore, seek<br>both victory and the enhancement of his resources, by righteous means.'"
