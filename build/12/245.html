                            "Suka said, 'While living in the due observance of the duties of the<br>foremost of life, how should one, who seeks to attain to That which is<br>the highest object of knowledge, set one's soul on Yoga according to the<br>best of one's power?'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'Having acquired (purity of conduct and body) by the<br>practice of the first two modes of life, viz., Brahmacharya and<br>domesticity, one should, after that, set one's soul on Yoga in the third<br>mode of life. Listen now with concentrated attention to what should be<br>done for attaining to the highest object of acquisition![1021] Having<br>subdued all faults of the mind and of heart by easy means in the practice<br>of the first three modes of life (viz., pupilage, domesticity, and<br>seclusion) one should pass into the most excellent and the most eminent<br>of all the modes, viz., Sannyasa or Renunciation. Do thou then pass thy<br>days, having acquired that purity. Listen also to me. One should, alone<br>and without anybody to assist him or bear him company, practise Yoga for<br>attaining to success (in respect of one's highest object of acquisition).<br>One who practises Yoga without companionship, who beholds everything as a<br>repetition of his own self, and who never discards anything (in<br>consequence of all things being pervaded by the Universal Soul), never<br>falls away from Emancipation. Without keeping the sacrificial fires and<br>without a fixed habitation, such a person should enter a village for only<br>begging his food. He should provide himself for the day without storing<br>for the morrow. He should betake himself to penances, with heart fixed on<br>the Supreme.[1022] Eating little and that even under proper regulations,<br>he should not eat more than once a day. The other indications of a<br>(religious) mendicant are the human skull, shelter under trees, rags for<br>wearing, solitude unbroken by the companionship of any one, and<br>indifference to all creatures.[1023] That person into whom words enter<br>like affrighted elephants into a well, and from whom they never come back<br>to the speaker, is fit to lead this mode of life which has Emancipation<br>for its object.[1024] The mendicant (or Renouncer) should never take note<br>of the evil acts of any person. He should never hear what is said in<br>dispraise of others. Especially should he avoid speaking evil of a<br>Brahmana. He should always say only what is agreeable to the Brahmanas.<br>When anything is said in dispraise (of himself), he should (without<br>answering) remain perfectly silent. Such silence, indeed, is the medical<br>treatment prescribed for him. That person in consequence of whose single<br>self the place he occupies becomes like the eastern sky, and who can make<br>a spot teeming with thousands of men and things appear to himself<br>perfectly solitary or unoccupied, is regarded by the deities to be a true<br>Brahmana.[1025] Him the gods know for a Brahmana who clothes himself with<br>whatever comes by the way, who subsists upon whatever he gets, and who<br>sleeps on whatever spot he finds. Him the gods know for a Brahmana who is<br>afraid of company as of a snake; of the full measure of gratification<br>(from sweet viands and drinks) as of hell; and of women as of a<br>corpse.[1026] Him the gods know for a Brahmana who is never glad when<br>honoured and never angry when insulted, and who has given assurances of<br>compassion unto all creatures. One in the observance of the last mode of<br>life should not view death with joy. Nor should he view life with joy. He<br>should only wait for his hour like a servant waiting for the behest (of<br>his master). He should purify his heart of all faults. He should purify<br>his speech of all faults. He should cleanse himself of all sins. As he<br>has no foes, what fear can assail him? He who fears no creature and whom<br>no creature fears, can have no fear from any quarter, freed as he is from<br>error of every kind. As the footprints of all other creatures that move<br>upon legs are engulfed within those of elephants, after the same manner<br>all ranks and conditions are absorbed within Yoga[1027]. After the same<br>manner, every other duty and observance is supposed to be engulfed within<br>the one duty of abstention from injury (to all creatures).[1028] He lives<br>an everlasting life of felicity who avoids injuring other creatures. One<br>who abstains from injury, who casts an equal eye upon all creatures, who<br>is devoted to truth, who is endued with fortitude, who has his senses<br>under control, and who grants protection to all beings, attains to an end<br>that is beyond compare. The condition called death succeeds not in<br>transcending such a person who is content with self-knowledge, who is<br>free from fear, and who is divested of desire and expectancy. On the<br>other hand, such a person succeeds in transcending death. Him the gods<br>know for a Brahmana who is freed from attachments of every kind, who is<br>observant of penances, who lives like space which while holding<br>everything is yet unattached to any thing, who has nothing which he calls<br>his own, who leads a life of solitude, and whose is tranquillity of soul.<br>The gods know him for a Brahmana whose life is for the practice of<br>righteousness, whose righteousness is for the good of them that wait<br>dutifully upon him, and whose days and nights exist only for the<br>acquisition of merit.[1029] The gods know him for a Brahmana who is freed<br>from desire, who never exerts himself for doing such acts as are done by<br>worldly men, who never bends his head unto any one, who never flatters<br>another, (and who is free from attachments of every kind). All creatures<br>are pleased with happiness and filled with fear at the prospect of grief.<br>The man of faith, therefore, who should feel distressed at the prospect<br>of filling other creatures with grief, must abstain entirely from acts of<br>every kind.[1030] The gift of assurances of harmlessness unto all<br>creatures transcends in point of merit all other gifts. He who, at the<br>outset, forswears the religion of injury, succeeds in attaining to<br>Emancipation (in which or) whence is the assurance of harmlessness unto<br>all creatures.[1031] That man who does not pour into his open mouth even<br>the five or six mouthfuls that are laid down for the forest recluse, is<br>said to be the navel of the world, and the refuge of the universe. The<br>head and other limbs, as also the acts good and bad, become possessed by<br>Fire. Such a man, who sacrifices in his own self, makes a liberation of<br>his senses and mind into the fire that dwells within the limited space of<br>his own heart. In consequence again of his pouring such a libation into<br>such a fire within his own self, the universe with all creatures<br>including the very gods, becomes gratified.[1032] They who apprehend the<br>Jiva-soul that is endued with effulgence, that is enveloped in three<br>cases, that has three attributes for its characteristics, to be Iswara<br>partaking of that which is foremost, viz., the nature of the Supreme<br>Soul, becomes object of great regard in all the worlds. The very gods<br>with all human beings speak highly of their merits. He who succeeds in<br>beholding in the soul that resides in his own body all the Vedas, space<br>and the other objects of perception, the rituals that occur in<br>scriptures, all those entities that are comprehensible in sound only and<br>the superior nature of the Supreme Soul, is sought to be worshipped by<br>the very deities as the foremost of all beings. He who sees in the soul<br>that resides within his body, that foremost of beings which is not<br>attached to the earth, which is immeasurable in even the (measureless)<br>firmament, which is made of gold, which is born of the egg and resides<br>within the egg, which is equipped with many feathers, and which has two<br>wings like a bird, and which is rendered effulgent by many rays of light,<br>is sought to be worshipped by the very deities as the foremost of all<br>beings.[1033] The very deities worship him in whose understanding is set<br>the wheel of Time, which is constantly resolving, which knows no decay,<br>which swallows up the period of existence of every creature, which has<br>the six seasons for its naves, which is equipped with two and ten radii<br>consisting of the two and ten months, which has excellent joint, and<br>towards whose gaping mouth proceeds this universe (ready to be<br>devoured).[1034] The Supreme Soul is the capacious unconsciousness of<br>dreamless slumber. That Unconsciousness is the body of the universe. It<br>pervadeth all created things. Jiva, occupying a portion of that capacious<br>unconsciousness gratifies the deities. These last, being gratified,<br>gratify the open mouth of that unconsciousness.[1035] Endued with<br>effulgence as also with the principle of eternity, Jiva is without a<br>beginning. It acquires (by following particular paths) infinite regions<br>of eternal happiness. He of whom no creature is afraid, has never to fear<br>any creature. He who never does anything censurable and who never<br>censures another, is said to be a truly regenerate person. Such a man<br>succeeds in beholding the Supreme Soul. He whose ignorance has been<br>dispelled and whose sins have been washed away, never enjoys either here<br>or hereafter the happiness that is enjoyed by others (but attains to<br>complete Emancipation). A person in the observance of the fourth mode of<br>life wanders on the earth like one unconnected with everything. Such a<br>one is freed from wrath and error. Such a one regards a clod of earth and<br>lump of gold with an equal eye. Such a man never stores anything for his<br>use. Such a one has no friends and foes. Such a one is utterly regardless<br>of praise or blame, and of the agreeable and the disagreeable.'"
