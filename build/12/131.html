                            (Apaddharmanusasana Parva)<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'What, besides this, should be done by a king that is<br>weak and procrastinating, that does not engage in battle from anxiety for<br>the lives of his friends, that is always under the influence of fear, and<br>that cannot keep his counsels secret? What, indeed, should that king do<br>whose cities and kingdom have been partitioned and appropriated by foes,<br>who is divested of wealth, who is incapable (through such poverty) of<br>honouring his friends and attaching them to himself, whose ministers are<br>disunited or bought over by his enemies, who is obliged to stand in the<br>face of foes, whose army has dwindled away, and whose heart has been<br>agitated by some strong enemy?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'If the invading enemy be of pure heart and if he be<br>conversant with both morality and profit, a king of the kind you have<br>indicated should, with no loss of time, make peace with the invader and<br>bring about the restoration of those portions of the kingdom that have<br>already been conquered. If, again, the invader be strong and sinful and<br>seek to obtain victory by unrighteous means, the king should make peace<br>with him, too, by abandoning a portion of his territories. If the invader<br>be unwilling to make peace, the king should then abandon his very capital<br>and all his possessions for escaping from danger. If he can save his life<br>he may hope for similar acquisitions in future. What man conversant with<br>morality is there that would sacrifice his own self, which is a more<br>valuable possession, for encountering that danger from which escape can<br>be had by the abandonment of his treasury and army? A king should protect<br>the ladies of his household. If these fall into the hands of the enemy,<br>he should not show any compassion for them (by incurring the risk of his<br>own arrest in delivering them). As long as it is in his power, he should<br>never surrender his own self to the enemy.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'When his own people are dissatisfied with him, when<br>he is oppressed by invaders, when his treasury is exhausted, and when his<br>counsels are divulged, what should the king then do?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'A king, under such circumstances, should (if his enemy be<br>righteous) seek to make peace with him. If the enemy be unrighteous, he<br>should then put forth his valour. He should, by such means, seek to cause<br>the foe to withdraw from his kingdom; or fighting bravely, he should lay<br>down his life and ascend to heaven. A king can conquer the whole earth<br>with the help of even a small force if that force be loyal, cheerful, and<br>devoted to his good. If slain in battle, he is sure to ascend to heaven.<br>If he succeeds in slaying (his enemies), he is sure to enjoy the earth.<br>By laying down one's life in battle, one obtains the companionship of<br>Indra himself.'"
