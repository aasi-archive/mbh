                            "Janamejaya said, 'How O Brahmana, was the Horse-sacrifice of the<br>Prajapati Daksha, the son of Prachetas, destroyed during the age of<br>Vaivaswata Manu? Understanding that the goddess Uma had become filled<br>with rage and grief, the puissant Mahadeva, who is the soul of all<br>things, gave way to wrath. How, again, through his grace, was Daksha<br>enable to reunite the divided limbs of that Sacrifice? I desire to know<br>all this. Tell me all this, O Brahmana, truly as it occurred.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'In days of yore Daksha made arrangements for<br>performing a Sacrifice on the breast of Himavat in that sacred region<br>inhabited by Rishis and Siddhas where the Ganges issues out of the<br>mountains. Overgrown with trees and creepers of diverse kinds that spot<br>abounded with Gandharvas and Apsaras. Surrounded by crowds of Rishis,<br>Daksha, that foremost of virtuous men, that progenitor of creatures, was<br>waited upon by the denizens of the earth, the firmament, and the heavens,<br>with their hands joined together in reverence. The gods, the Danavas, the<br>Gandharvas, the Pisachas, the Snakes, the Rakshasas, the two Gandharvas<br>named Haha and Huhu, Tumvuru and Narada, Viswavasu, Viswasena, the<br>Gandharvas and the Apsaras, the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the<br>Sadhyas, the Maruts, all came there with Indra for sharing in the<br>Sacrifice. The drinkers of Soma, the drinkers of smoke, the drinkers of<br>Ajya, the Rishis, and the Pitris came there with the Brahmanas. These,<br>and many other living creatures belonging to the four orders, viz.,<br>viviparous and oviparous and filth-born and vegetable, were invited to<br>that Sacrifice. The gods also, with their spouses, respectfully invited<br>thereto, came on their celestial cars and seated thereon shone like<br>blazing fires. Beholding them, the Rishi Dadhichi became filled with<br>grief and wrath, and said, 'This is neither a Sacrifice nor a meritorious<br>rite of religion, since Rudra is not adored in it. Ye are certainly<br>exposing yourselves to death and chains. Alas, how untoward is the course<br>of time. Stupefied by error you do not behold that destruction awaits<br>you. A terrible calamity stands at your door in course of this great<br>Sacrifice. Ye are blind to it!' Having said these words, that great Yogin<br>saw into the future with eyes of (Yoga) contemplation. He beheld<br>Mahadeva, and his divine spouse, viz., that giver of excellent boons<br>(seated on the summit of Kailasa) with the highsouled Narada sitting<br>beside the goddess. Conversant with Yoga, Dadhichi became highly<br>gratified, having ascertained what was about to happen. All the deities<br>and others that had come there were of one mind with reference to the<br>omission to invite the Lord of all creatures. Dadhichi alone, desirous of<br>leaving that spot, then said, 'By worshipping one who should not be<br>worshipped, and by refusing to worship him who should be worshipped, a<br>man incurs the sin of homicide for ever. I have never before spoken an<br>untruth, and an untruth I shall never speak. Here in the midst of the<br>gods and the Rishis I say the truth. The Protector of all creatures, the<br>Creator of the universe, the Lord of all, the Puissant master, the taker<br>of sacrificial offerings, will soon come to this Sacrifice and you all<br>shall see him.'<br><br>"Daksha said, 'We have many Rudras armed with lances and bearing matted<br>locks on their heads. They are eleven in number. I know them all, but I<br>do not know who this (new Rudra) Maheswara is.'<br><br>"Dadhichi said, 'This seems to be the counsel of all that are here, viz.,<br>that Maheswara should not be invited. As, however, I do not behold any<br>god that can be said to be superior to him. I am sure that this proposed<br>Sacrifice of Daksha will certainly be overtaken by destruction.'<br><br>"Daksha said, 'Here, in this vessel of gold, intended for the Lord of all<br>Sacrifices, is the sacrificial offering sanctified by mantras and (rites)<br>according to the ordinance. I intend to make this offering unto Vishnu<br>who is beyond compare. He is puissant and the Master of all, and unto Him<br>should sacrifices be performed.'<br><br>'Meanwhile,' continued Vaisampayana, 'the goddess Uma, sitting with her<br>lord, said these words.'<br><br>"Uma said, 'What are those gifts, what those vows, and what are those<br>penances, that I should make or undergo by means of which my illustrious<br>husband may be able to obtain a half or a third share of the offerings in<br>sacrifices. Unto his wife who was agitated with grief and who repeated<br>these words the illustrious Mahadeva said with a joyous countenance,<br>'Thou dost not know me, O goddess! Thou knowest not, O thou of delicate<br>limbs and low belly, what words are proper to be addressed to the Lord of<br>Sacrifices. O lady of large eyes, I know that it is only the sinful, who<br>are bereft of contemplation, that do not understand me.[1404] It is<br>through thy power of illusion that the deities with Indra at their head<br>and the three worlds all become stupefied.[1405] It is to me that the<br>chanters utter their praises in Sacrifices. It is to me that the<br>Saman-singers sing their Rathantaras. It is to me that Brahmanas<br>conversant with the Vedas perform their Sacrifices. And it is to me that<br>the Adhvaryus dedicate the shares of sacrificial offerings.'<br><br>"The goddess said, 'Persons of even ordinary abilities applaud themselves<br>and indulge in the presence of their spouses. There is no doubt in this.'<br><br>"The holy one said, 'O Queen of all the gods, I do not certainly applaud<br>my ownself. Behold now, O lady of slender waist, what I do. Behold the<br>Being that I will create, O thou of the fairest complexion, for<br>(destroying) this Sacrifice (that has displeased thee), O my beautiful<br>spouse.<br><br>"Having said these words unto his spouse Uma who was dearer to him than<br>his own life, the puissant Mahadeva created from his mouth a terrible<br>Being whose very sight could make one's hair stand on its end. The<br>blazing flames that emanated from his body rendered him exceedingly awful<br>to behold. His arms were many in number and in each was a weapon that<br>struck the beholder with fear. That Being, thus created, stood before the<br>great god, with joined hands, and said, 'What commands shall I have to<br>accomplish?' Maheswara answered him, saying, 'Go and destroy the<br>Sacrifice of Daksha.' Thus ordered, that Being of leonine prowess who had<br>issued from the mouth of Mahadeva, desired to destroy the Sacrifice of<br>Daksha, without putting forth all his energy and without the assistance<br>of any one else, for dispelling the wrath of Uma. Urged by her wrath, the<br>spouse of Maheswara, herself assuming a dreadful form that is known by<br>the name Mahakali, proceeded in the company of that Being who had issued<br>from Mahadeva's mouth, for witnessing with her own eyes the act of<br>destruction which was her own (for it was she who had impelled her lord<br>to accomplish it for her sake). That mighty Being then set out, having<br>obtained the permission of Mahadeva and having bowed his head unto him.<br>In energy, strength, and form, he resembled Maheswara himself who had<br>created him. Indeed, he was the living embodiment of (Mahadeva's) wrath.<br>Of immeasurable might and energy, and of immeasurable courage and<br>prowess, he came to be called by the name of Virabhadra&#8212;that dispeller<br>of the goddess's wrath. He then created from the pores of his body a<br>large number of spirit chiefs known by the name of Raumyas. Those fierce<br>bands of spirits, endued with terrible energy and prowess and resembling<br>Rudra himself on that account, rushed with the force of thunder to that<br>place where Daksha was making preparations for his sacrifice, impelled by<br>the desire of destroying it. Possessed of dreadful and gigantic forms,<br>they numbered by hundreds and thousands. They filled the sky with their<br>confused cries and shrieks. That noise filled the denizens of heaven with<br>fear. The very mountains were riven and the earth trembled. Whirl winds<br>began to blow. The Ocean rose in a surge. The fires that were kindled<br>refused to blaze up. The Sun became dimmed. The planets, the stars, and<br>constellations, and the moon, no longer shone. The Rishis, the gods, and<br>human beings, looked pale. A universal darkness spread over earth and<br>sky. The insulted Rudras began to set fire to everything. Some amongst<br>them of terrible form began to smite and strike. Some tore up the<br>sacrificial stakes. Some began to grind and others to crush. Endued with<br>the speed of wind or thought, some began to rush close and far. Some<br>began to break the sacrificial vessels and the celestial ornaments. The<br>scattered fragments strewed the ground like stars bespangling the<br>firmament. Heaps of excellent viands, of bottles of drink, and of<br>eatables there were that looked like mountains. Rivers of milk ran on<br>every side, with clarified butter and Payasa for their mire, creamy curds<br>for their water, and crystalised sugar for their sands. Those rivers<br>contained all the six tastes. There were lakes of treacle that looked<br>very beautiful. Meat of diverse kinds, of the best quality, and other<br>eatables of various sorts, and many excellent varieties of drink, and<br>several other kinds of food that might be licked and sucked, began to be<br>eaten by that army of spirits with diverse mouths. And they began to cast<br>off and scatter those varieties of food in all directions. In consequence<br>of Rudra's wrath, every one of those gigantic Beings looked like the<br>all-destructive Yuga-fire. Agitating the celestial troops they caused<br>them to tremble with fear and fly away in all directions. Those fierce<br>spirits sported with one another, and seizing the celestial damsels<br>shoved and hurled them on all sides. Of fierce deeds, those Beings,<br>impelled by Rudra's wrath, very soon burnt that Sacrifice although it was<br>protected with great care by all the deities. Loud were the roars they<br>uttered which struck every living creature with dread. Having torn off<br>the head of Sacrifice they indulged in glee and shouts. Then the gods<br>headed by Brahman, and that progenitor of creatures, viz., Daksha,<br>joining their hands in reverence, addressed that mighty Being, saying,<br>'Tell us, who thou art.'<br><br>"Virabhadra said, 'I am neither Rudra nor his spouse, the goddess Uma.<br>Nor have I come here for partaking of the fare (provided in this<br>Sacrifice). Knowing the fact of Uma's wrath, the puissant Lord who is the<br>soul of all creatures has given way to wrath. I have not come here for<br>seeing these foremost of Brahmanas. I have not come here urged by<br>curiosity. Know that I have come here for destroying this Sacrifice of<br>yours. I am known by the name of Virabhadra and I have sprung from the<br>wrath of Rudra. This lady (who is my companion), and who is called<br>Bhadrakali, hath sprung from the wrath of the goddess. We have both been<br>despatched by that god of gods, and we have accordingly come here. O<br>foremost of Brahmanas, seek the protection of that Lord of the deities,<br>the spouse of Uma. It is preferable to incur even the wrath of that<br>foremost of gods than to obtain boons from any other Deity.' Hearing the<br>words of Virabhadra, Daksha, that foremost of all righteous persons,<br>bowed down unto Maheswara and sought to gratify him by uttering the<br>following hymn, 'I throw myself at the feet of the effulgent Isana, who<br>is Eternal, Immutable, and Indestructible; who is the foremost of all<br>gods, who is endued with high soul, who is the Lord of all the universe.'<br>[Here follow five and half slokas which appear to be interpolations]. His<br>praises having thus been hymned, the great god, Mahadeva, suspending both<br>Prana and Apana (the two foremost of the five life-breaths) by shutting<br>his mouth properly, and casting (benignant) glances on every side, showed<br>himself there. Possessed of many eyes, that vanquisher of all foes, that<br>Lord of even the gods of all gods, suddenly arose from within the pit in<br>which was kept the sacrificial fire. Possessed of the effulgence of a<br>thousand Suns, and looking like another Samvartaka, the great god smiled<br>gently (at Daksha) and addressing him, said, 'What, O Brahmana, shall I<br>do for you?' At this juncture, the preceptor of all the deities adored<br>Mahadeva with the Vedic verses contained in the Moksha sections. Then<br>that progenitor of all creatures, viz., Daksha, joining his hands in<br>reverence, filled with dread and fear, exceedingly agitated, and with<br>face and eyes bathed in tears, addressed the great god in the following<br>words.'<br><br>"Daksha said, 'If the great god has been gratified with me,&#8212;'if indeed,<br>I have become an object of favour with him,&#8212;if I have deserved his<br>kindness,&#8212;if the great Lord of all creatures is disposed to grant me<br>boons,&#8212;then let all these articles of mine that have been burnt, eaten,<br>drunk, swallowed, destroyed, broken, and polluted,&#8212;let all these<br>articles, collected in course of these articles be of use to me. Even<br>this is the boon I crave.' Unto him the many long years, and with great<br>care and effort, go not for nothing. Let illustrious Hara, the tearer of<br>Bhaga's eyes, said, 'Let it be as thou sayest!' Even these were the words<br>of that illustrious progenitor of all creatures, that god of three eyes,<br>that protector of righteousness.[1406] Having obtained that boon from<br>Bhava, Daksha knelt down to him and adored that deity having the bull for<br>his mark, by uttering his thousand and eight names.'
