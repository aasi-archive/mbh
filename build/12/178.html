                            "Bhishma continued, 'In this connection is also cited the old narrative<br>of the verses sung by Janaka the ruler of the Videhas, who had attained<br>to tranquillity of soul. What the monarch said was, 'Unlimited is my<br>wealth. At the same time I have nothing, if the whole of (my kingdom)<br>Mithila be consumed in a conflagration, I shall incur no loss.' In the<br>connection is also cited the speech of Vodhya uttered in respect of this<br>very topic, viz., freedom from attachments. Listen to it O Yudhishthira!<br>Once on a time the royal son of Nahusha (Yayati) questioned the Rishi<br>Vodhya who had, in consequence of the abandonment of desire, attained to<br>tranquillity of soul and who had an intimate acquaintance with the<br>scriptures. The monarch said, 'O thou of great wisdom, give me<br>instructions about tranquillity. What is that under standing relying upon<br>which thou succeedest in wandering over the world in tranquillity of soul<br>and disengaged from all acts?'<br><br>"Vodhya said, 'I conduct myself according to the instructions of others<br>but never instruct others myself. I shall, however, mention the<br>indications of those instructions (according to which my conduct is<br>framed). Thou mayst catch their spirit by reflection. My six preceptors<br>are Pingala, the osprey, the snake, the bee in the forest, the maker of<br>shafts (in the story), and the maiden (in the story)!'[533]<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Hope is very powerful (in agitating the heart), O<br>King! Freedom from hope is high felicity. Reducing hope to an absence of<br>expectation, Pingala sleeps in peace.[534] Beholding an osprey with meat<br>in his beaks, others, that have not found any meat, assail and destroy<br>him. A certain osprey, by altogether abstaining from meat obtained<br>felicity. To build a house for one's own self is productive of sorrow and<br>not of happiness. The snake, taking up his residence in another<br>creature's abode, lives in felicity. The ascetics live happily, betaking<br>themselves to mendicancy, without being injured by any creature, like<br>bees in the forest. A certain maker of shafts, while employed at his<br>work, was so deeply attentive to it that he did not notice the king who<br>passed by his side. When many are together, dispute ensues. Even when two<br>reside together, they are sure to converse. I, however, wander alone like<br>the anklet made of sea-shells in the wrist of the maiden in the<br>story.'"[535]
