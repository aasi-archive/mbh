                            "Parasara said, 'The lowest order, it is proper, should derive their<br>sustenance from the three other orders. Such service, rendered with<br>affection and reverence, makes them righteous.[1522] If the ancestors of<br>any Sudra were not engaged in service, he should not still engage himself<br>in any other occupation (than service). Truly, he should apply himself to<br>service as his occupation. In my opinion, it is proper for them to<br>associate, under all circumstances, with good men devoted to<br>righteousness, but never with those that are wicked. As in the Eastern<br>hills, jewels and metals blaze with greater splendour in consequence of<br>their adjacence to the Sun, even so the lowest order blazes with<br>splendour in consequence of their association with the good. A piece of<br>white cloth assumes that hue with which it is dyed. Even such is the case<br>with Sudras.[1523] Hence also, one should attach oneself to all good<br>qualities but never to qualities that are evil. The life of human beings<br>in this world is fleeting and transitory. That wise man who, in happiness<br>as also in misery, achieves only what is good, is regarded as a true<br>observer of the scriptures. That man who is endued with intelligence<br>would never do an act which is dissociated from virtue, however high may<br>the advantages be of that act. Indeed, such an act is not regarded as<br>truly beneficial. That lawless king who, snatching thousands of kine from<br>their lawful owners, gives them away (unto deserving persons), acquires<br>no fruit (from that act of giving) beyond an empty sound (expressive of<br>the act he does). On the other hand, he incurs the sin of theft. The<br>Self-born at first created the Being called Dhatri held in universal<br>respect. Dhatri created a son who was engaged in upholding all the<br>worlds.[1524] Worshipping that deity, the Vaisya employs himself, for the<br>means of his support, in agriculture and the rearing of cattle. The<br>Kshatriyas should employ themselves in the task of protecting all the<br>other classes. The Brahmanas should only enjoy. As regards the Sudras,<br>they should engage themselves in the task of humbly and honestly<br>collecting together the articles that are to be offered in sacrifices,<br>and in cleaning altars and other places where sacrifices are to be<br>performed. If each order acts in this way, righteousness would not suffer<br>any diminution. If righteousness is preserved in its entirety, all<br>creatures inhabiting the earth would be happy. Beholding the happiness of<br>all creatures on earth, the deities in heaven become filled with<br>gladness. Hence, that king who, agreeably to the duties laid down for his<br>order, protects the other classes, becomes worthy of respect. Similarly,<br>the Brahmana that is employed in studying the scriptures, the Vaisya that<br>is engaged in earning wealth, and the Sudra that is always engaged in<br>serving the three other classes with concentrated attention, become<br>objects of respect. By conducting themselves in the other ways, O chief<br>of men, each order is said to fall away from virtue. Keeping aside gifts<br>by thousands, even twenty cowries that one may give painfully, having<br>earned them righteously, will be productive of the great benefit. Those<br>persons, O king, who make gifts unto Brahmanas after reverencing them<br>duly, reap excellent fruits commensurate with those gifts. That gift is<br>highly prized which the donor makes after seeking out the donee and<br>honouring him properly. That gift is middling which the donor makes upon<br>solicitation. That gift, however, which is made contemptuously and<br>without any reverence, is said to be very inferior (in point of merit).<br>Even this is what those utterers of the truth, viz., the sages, say.<br>While sinking in this ocean of life, man should always seek to cross that<br>ocean by various means. Indeed, he should so exert himself that he might<br>be freed from the bonds of this world. The Brahmana shines by self<br>restraint; the Kshatriya by victory; the Vaisya by wealth; while the<br>Sudra always shines in glory through cleverness in serving (the three<br>other orders).'"
