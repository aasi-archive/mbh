                            "Bhishma said, Having ascended the summit of the mountain, O Bharata, the<br>son of Vyasa sat down upon a level spot free from blades of grass and<br>retired from the haunts of other creatures. Agreeably to the direction of<br>the scriptures and to the ordinances laid down, that ascetic, conversant<br>with the gradual order of the successive processes of Yoga, held his soul<br>first in one place and then in another, commencing from his feet and<br>proceeding through all the limbs. Then when the Sun had not risen long,<br>Suka sat, with his face turned Eastwards, and hands and feet drawn in, in<br>an humble attitude. In that spot where the intelligent son of Vyasa sat<br>prepared to address himself to Yoga, there were no flocks of birds, no<br>sound, and no sight that was repulsive or terror-inspiring. He then<br>beheld his own Soul freed from all attachments. Beholding that highest of<br>all things, he laughed in joy.[1787] He once more set himself pre-pared<br>to Yoga for attaining to the path of Emancipation. Becoming the great<br>master of Yoga, he transcended the element of space. He then<br>circumambulated the celestial Rishi Narada, and represented unto that<br>foremost of Rishis the fact of his having addressed himself to the<br>highest Yoga.<br><br>"Suka said,&#8212;I have succeeded in beholding the path (of Emancipation), I<br>have addrest myself to it. Blessed be thou, O thou of wealth of penances!<br>I shall, through thy grace, O thou of great splendour, attain to an end<br>that is highly desirable!"<br><br>"Bhishma said,&#8212;'Having received the permission of Narada, Suka the son<br>of the Island-born Vyasa saluted the celestial Rishi and once more set<br>himself to Yoga and entered the element of space. Ascending then from the<br>breast of the Kailasa mountain, he soared into the sky. Capable of<br>traversing through the welkin, the blessed Suka of fixed conclusion, then<br>identified himself with the element of Wind. As that foremost of<br>regenerate ones, possessed of effulgence like that of Garuda, was<br>traversing through the skies with the speed of the wind or thought, all<br>creatures, cast their eyes upon him. Endued with the splendour of fire or<br>the Sun, Suka then regarded the three worlds in their entirety as one<br>homogenous Brahma, and proceeded along that path of great length. Indeed,<br>all creatures mobile and immobile, cast their eyes upon him as he<br>proceeded with concentrated attention, and a tranquil and fearless soul.<br>All creatures, agreeably to the ordinance and according to their power,<br>worshipped him with reverence. The denizens of heaven rained showers of<br>celestial flowers upon him. Beholding him, all the tribes of Apsaras and<br>Gandharvas became filled with wonder. The Rishis also, that were crowned<br>with success, became equally amazed. And they asked themselves,&#8212;who is<br>this one that has attained to success by his penances?&#8212;With gaze<br>with-drawn from his own body but turned upwards he is filling us all with<br>pleasure by his glances!&#8212;Of highly righteous soul and celebrated<br>through-out the three worlds, Suka proceeded in silence, his face turned<br>towards the East and gaze directed towards the sun. As he proceeded, he<br>seemed to fill the entire welkin with an all-pervading noise. Beholding<br>him coming in that way, all the tribes of the Apsaras, struck with awe, O<br>king, became filled with amazement. Headed by Panchachuda and others,<br>they looked at Suka with eyes expanded by wonder. And they asked one<br>another, saying;&#8212;What deity is this one that has attained to such a high<br>end? Without doubt, he comes hither, freed from all attachments and<br>emancipated from all desires!&#8212;Suka then proceeded to the Malaya<br>mountains where Urvasi and Purvachitti used to dwell always. Both of them<br>beholding the energy of the son of the great regenerate Rishi, became<br>filled with wonder. And they said,&#8212;Wonderful is this concentration of<br>attention (to Yoga) of a regenerate youth who was accustomed to the<br>recitation and study of the Vedas! Soon will he traverse the entire<br>welkin like the Moon. It was by dutiful service and humble ministrations<br>towards his sire that he acquired this excellent understanding. He is<br>firmly attached to his sire, possessed of austere penances, and is very<br>much loved by his sire. Alas, why has he been dismissed by his<br>inattentive father to proceed (thus) along a way whence there is no<br>return?&#8212;Hearing these words of Urvasi, and attending to their import,<br>Suka, that foremost of all persons conversant with duties, cast his eyes<br>on all sides, and once more beheld the entire welkin, the whole Earth<br>with her mountains and waters and forests, and also all the lakes and<br>rivers. All the deities also of both sexes, joining their hands, paid<br>reverence to the son of the Island-born Rishi and gazed at him with<br>wonder and respect. That foremost of all righteous men, Suka, addressing<br>all of them, said these words,&#8212;If my sire follow me and repeatedly call<br>after me by my name, do all of you together return him an answer for me.<br>Moved by the affection all of you bear for me, do you accomplish this<br>request of mine!&#8212;Hearing these words of Suka, all the points of the<br>compass, all the forest, all the seas, all the rivers, and all the<br>mountains, answered him from every side, saying,&#8212;We accept thy command,<br>O regenerate one! It shall be as thou sayst! It is in this way that we<br>answer the words spoken by the Rishi!
