                            "Vyasa said, 'There is a wonderful tree, called Desire, in the heart of a<br>man. It is born of the seed called Error. Wrath and pride constitute its<br>large trunk. The wish for action is the basin around its foot (for<br>holding the water that is to nourish it). Ignorance is the root of that<br>tree, and heedlessness is the water that gives it sustenance. Envy<br>constitutes its leaves. The evil acts of past lives supply it with<br>vigour. Loss of judgment and anxiety are its twigs; grief forms its large<br>branches; and fear is its sprout. Thirst (after diverse objects) that is<br>(apparently) agreeable forms the creepers that twine round it on every<br>side. Excessively greedy men, bound in chains of iron, sitting around<br>that fruit-yielding tree, pay their adorations to it, in expectation of<br>obtaining its fruit.[1096] He who, subduing those chains, cutteth down<br>that tree and seeks to cast off both sorrow and joy, succeeds in<br>attaining to the end of both.[1097] That foolish man who nourishes this<br>tree by indulgence in the objects of the senses is destroyed by those<br>very objects in which he indulges after the manner of a poisonous pill<br>destroying the patient to whom it is administered.[1098] A dexterous<br>person, however, by the aid of Yoga, forcibly teareth up and cutteth with<br>the sword of samadhi, the far-reaching root of this tree.[1099] One who<br>knows that the end of all acts undertaken from only the desire of fruit<br>is rebirth or chains that bind, succeeds in transcending all sorrow. The<br>body is said to be a city. The understanding is said to be its mistress.<br>The mind dwelling within the body is the minister of that mistress whose<br>chief function is to decide. The senses are the citizen that are employed<br>by the mind (upon the service of the mistress). For cherishing those<br>citizens the mind displays a strong inclination for acts of diverse<br>kinds. In the matter of those acts, two great faults are observable,<br>viz., Tamas and Rajas.[1100] Upon the fruits of those acts rest those<br>citizens along with the chiefs of the city (viz., Mind, Understanding,<br>and Consciousness).[1101] The two faults (already spoken of) live upon<br>the fruits of those acts that are accomplished by forbidden means. This<br>being the case, the understanding, which of itself is unconquerable (by<br>either Rajas or Tamas), descends to a state of equality with the mind (by<br>becoming as much tainted as the mind that serves it). Then again the<br>senses, agitated by the stained mind, lose their own stability. Those<br>objects again for whose acquisition the understanding strives (regarding<br>them to be beneficial) become productive of grief and ultimately Meet<br>with destruction. Those objects, after destruction, are recollected by<br>the mind, and accordingly they afflict the mind even after they are lost.<br>The understanding is afflicted at the same time, for the mind is said to<br>be different from the understanding only when the mind is considered in<br>respect of its chief function of receiving impressions about whose<br>certainty it is no judge. In reality, however, the mind is identical with<br>the understanding.[1102] The Rajas (productive of only sorrow and evil of<br>every kind) that is in the understanding then overwhelms the Soul itself<br>that lies over the Rajas-stained understanding like an image upon a<br>mirror.[1103] It is the mind that first unites in friendship with Rajas.<br>Having united itself, it seizes the soul, the understanding, and the<br>senses (like a false minister seizing the king and the citizens after<br>having conspired with a foe) and makes them over to Rajas (with which it<br>has united itself).'"
