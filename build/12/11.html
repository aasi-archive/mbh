                            "Arjuna said, 'In this connection an old history is cited, viz., the<br>discourse between certain ascetics and Sakra, O bull of Bharata's race! A<br>number of well-born Brahmana youth of little understanding, without the<br>hirsute honours of manhood, abandoning their homes, came to the woods for<br>leading a forest life. Regarding that to be virtue, those youths of<br>abundant resources became desirous of living as Brahmacharins, having<br>abandoned their brothers and sires. It so happened that Indra became<br>compassionate towards them. Assuming the form of a golden bird, the holy<br>Sakra addressed them, saying, 'That which is done by persons that eat the<br>remnants of a sacrifice is the most difficult of acts that men can<br>achieve.[16] Such an act is highly meritorious. The lives of such men are<br>worthy of every praise. Having attained the object of life, those men,<br>devoted to virtue obtain the highest end.' Hearing these words, the<br>Rishis said, 'Lo, this bird applauds those that subsist upon the remnants<br>of sacrifices. He informs us of it, for we live upon such remnants.' The<br>bird then said, 'I do not applaud you.' Ye are stationed with mire and<br>very impure. Living upon offals, ye are wicked. Ye are not persons<br>subsisting upon the remnants of sacrifice.'<br><br>"The Rishis said, 'We regard this our course of life to be highly<br>blessed. Tell us, O bird, what is for our good. Thy words inspire us with<br>great faith.'<br><br>"The bird said, 'If you do not refuse me your faith by arraying<br>yourselves against your better selves, then I shall tell you words that<br>are true and beneficial.'<br><br>"The Rishis said, 'We shall listen to thy words, O sire, for the<br>different paths are all known to thee. O thou of righteous soul, we<br>desire also to obey thy commands. Instruct us now.'<br><br>"The bird said, 'Among quadrupeds the cow is the foremost. Of metals,<br>gold is the foremost. Of words, mantras, and of bipeds, the Brahmanas,<br>are the foremost. These mantras regulate all the rites of a Brahmana's<br>life beginning with those appertaining to birth and the period after it,<br>and ending with those appertaining to death and the crematorium. These<br>Vedic rites are his heaven, path, and foremost of sacrifices. If it were<br>otherwise, how could I find the acts (of persons in quest of heaven)<br>become successful through mantras? He who, in this world, adores his<br>soul, firmly regarding it to be a deity of a particular kind, obtains<br>success consistent with the nature of that particular deity.[17] The<br>seasons measured by half the months lead to the Sun, the Moon, or the<br>Stars.[18] These three kinds of success, depending upon action are<br>desired by every creature. The domestic mode of life is very superior and<br>sacred and is called the field (for the cultivation) of success. By what<br>path do those men go that censure action? Of little understanding and<br>deprived of wealth, they incur sin. And since those men of little<br>understanding live by abandoning the eternal paths of the gods, the paths<br>of the Rishis, and the paths of Brahma, therefore, they attain to paths<br>disapproved of by the Srutis.[19] There is an ordinance in the mantras<br>which says, 'Ye sacrificer, perform the sacrifice represented by gifts of<br>valuable things. I wilt give thee happiness represented by sons, animals,<br>and heaven!'&#8212;To live, therefore, in accordance with ordinance is said to<br>be the highest asceticism of the ascetics. Therefore, ye should perform<br>such sacrifices and such penances in the shape of gifts. The due<br>performance of these eternal duties, viz., the worship of the gods, the<br>study of the Vedas, and the gratification of the Pitris, as also<br>regardful services unto the preceptors&#8212;these are called the austerest of<br>penances. The gods, by performing such exceedingly difficult penances,<br>have obtained the highest glory and power. I, therefore, tell you to bear<br>the very heavy burthen of the duties of domesticity. Without doubt,<br>penances are the foremost of all things and are the root of all<br>creatures. Asceticism, however, is to be obtained by leading a life of<br>domesticity, upon which depends everything. They that eat the remnants of<br>feasts, after duly apportioning the food morning and evening among<br>kinsmen, attain to ends that are exceedingly difficult of attainment.<br>They are called eater of the remnants of feasts who eat after having<br>served guests and gods and Rishis and kinsmen. Therefore, those persons<br>that are observant of their own duties, that practise excellent vows and<br>are truthful in speech, become objects of great respect in the world,<br>with their own faith exceedingly strengthened. Free from pride, those<br>achievers of the most difficult feats attain to heaven and live for<br>unending time in the regions of Sakra.'<br><br>"Arjuna continued, 'Those ascetics then, hearing these words that were<br>beneficial and fraught with righteousness, abandoned the religion of<br>renunciation, saying, 'There is nothing in it,' and betook themselves to<br>a life of domesticity. Therefore, O thou that are conversant with<br>righteousness, calling to thy aid that eternal wisdom, rule the wide<br>world, O monarch that is now destitute of foes.'
