                            "Yudhishthira said, 'How, O king, may a kingdom be consolidated, and how<br>should it be protected? I desire to know this. Tell me all this, O bull<br>of Bharata's race!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen to me with concentrated attention. I shall tell<br>thee how a kingdom may be consolidated, and how also it may be protected.<br>A headman should be selected for each village. Over ten villages (or ten<br>headmen) there should be cone superintendent. Over two such<br>superintendents there should be one officer (having the control,<br>therefore, of twenty villages). Above the latter should be appointed<br>persons under each of whom should be a century of villages; and above the<br>last kind of officers, should be appointed men each of whom should have a<br>thousand villages under his control. The headman should ascertain the<br>characteristics of every person in the village and all the faults also<br>that need correction. He should report everything to the officer (who is<br>above him and is) in charge of ten villages. The latter, again, should<br>report the same to the officer (who is above him and is) in charge of<br>twenty villages. The latter, in his turn, should report the conduct of<br>all the persons within his dominion to the officer (who is above him and<br>is) in charge of a hundred villages. The village headman should have<br>control over all the produce and the possessions of the village. Every<br>headman should contribute his share for maintaining the lord of ten<br>villages, and the latter should do the same for supporting the lord of<br>twenty villages. The lord of a hundred villages should receive every<br>honour from the king and should have for his support a large village, O<br>chief of the Bharatas, populous and teeming with wealth. Such a village,<br>so assigned to a lord of hundred villages, should be, however, within the<br>control of the lord of a thousand villages. That high officer, again,<br>viz., the lord of a thousand villages, should have a minor town for his<br>support. He should enjoy the grain and gold and other possessions<br>derivable from it. He should perform all the duties of its wars and other<br>internal affairs pertaining to it. Some virtuous minister, with<br>wrathfulness should exercise supervision over the administration affairs<br>and mutual relations of those officers. In every town, again, there<br>should be an officer for attending to every matter relating to his<br>jurisdiction. Like some planet of dreadful form moving above all the<br>asterisms below, the officer (with plenary powers) mentioned last should<br>move and act above all the officers subordinate to him. Such an officer<br>should ascertain the conduct of those under him through his spies. Such<br>high officers should protect the people from all persons of murderous<br>disposition, all men of wicked deeds, all who rob other people of their<br>wealth, and all who are full of deceit, and all of whom are regarded to<br>be possessed by the devil. Taking note of the sales and the purchases,<br>the state of the roads, the food and dress, and the stocks and profits of<br>those that are engaged in trade, the king should levy taxes on them.<br>Ascertaining on all occasions the extent of the manufactures, the<br>receipts and expenses of those that are engaged in them, and the state of<br>the arts, the king should levy taxes upon the artisans in respect of the<br>arts they follow. The king, O Yudhishthira, may take high taxes, but he<br>should never levy such taxes as would emasculate his people. No tax<br>should be levied without ascertaining the outturn and the amount of<br>labour that has been necessary to produce it. Nobody would work or seek<br>for outturns without sufficient cause.[251] The king should, after<br>reflection, levy taxes in such a way that he and the person who labours<br>to produce the article taxed may both share the value. The king should<br>not, by his thirst, destroy his own foundations as also those of others.<br>He should always avoid those acts in consequence of which he may become<br>an object of hatred to his people. Indeed, by acting in this way he may<br>succeed in winning popularity. The subjects hate that king who earns a<br>notoriety for voraciousness of appetite (in the matter of taxes and<br>imposts). Whence can a king who becomes an object of hatred have<br>prosperity? Such a king can never acquire what is for his good. A king<br>who is possessed of sound intelligence should milk his kingdom after the<br>analogy of (men acting in the matter of) calves. If the calf be permitted<br>to suck, it grows strong, O Bharata, and bears heavy burthens. If, on the<br>other hand, O Yudhishthira, the cow be milked too much, the calf becomes<br>lean and fails to do much service to the owner. Similarly, if the kingdom<br>be drained much, the subjects fail to achieve any act that is great. That<br>king who protects his kingdom himself and shows favour to his subjects<br>(in the matter of taxes and imposts) and supports himself upon what is<br>easily obtained, succeeds in earning many grand results. Does not the<br>king then obtain wealth sufficient for enabling him to cope with his<br>wants?[252] The entire kingdom, in that case, becomes to him his<br>treasury, while that which is his treasury becomes his bed chamber. If<br>the inhabitants of the cities and the provinces be poor, the king should,<br>whether they depend upon him immediately or mediately, show them<br>compassion to the best of his power. Chastising all robbers that infest<br>the outskirts, the king should protect the people of his villages and<br>make them happy. The subjects, in the case, becoming sharers of the<br>king's weal and woe, feel exceedingly gratified with him. Thinking, in<br>the first instance, of collecting wealth, the king should repair to the<br>chief centres of his kingdom one after another and endeavour to inspire<br>his people with fright. He should say unto them, 'Here, calamity<br>threatens us. A great danger has arisen in consequence of the acts of the<br>foe. There is every reason, however, to hope that the danger will pass<br>away, for the enemy, like a bamboo that has flowered, will very soon meet<br>with destruction. Many foes of mine, having risen up and combined with a<br>large number of robbers, desire to put our kingdom into difficulties, for<br>meeting with destruction themselves. In view of this great calamity<br>fraught with dreadful danger, I solicit your wealth for devising the<br>means of your protection. When the danger passes away, I will give you<br>what I now take. Our foes, however, will not give back what they (if<br>unopposed) will take from you by force. On the other hand (if unopposed),<br>they will even slay all your relatives beginning with your very spouses.<br>You certainly desire wealth for the sake of your children and wives. I am<br>glad at your prosperity, and I beseech you as I would my own children. I<br>shall take from you what it may be within your power to give me. I do not<br>wish to give pain to any one. In seasons of calamity, you should, like<br>strong bulls, bear such burthens. In seasons of distress, wealth should<br>not be so dear to you. A king conversant with the considerations relating<br>to Time should, with such agreeable, sweet, and complimentary words, send<br>his agents and collect imposts from his people. Pointing out to them the<br>necessity of repairing his fortifications and of defraying the expenses<br>of his establishment and other heads, inspiring them with the fear of<br>foreign invasion, and impressing them with the necessity that exists for<br>protecting them and enabling them to ensure the means of living in peace,<br>the king should levy imposts upon the Vaisyas of his realm. If the king<br>disregards the Vaisyas, they become lost to him, and abandoning his<br>dominions remove themselves to the woods. The king should, therefore,<br>behave with leniency towards them. The king, O son of Pritha, should<br>always conciliate and protect the Vaisyas, adopt measures for inspiring<br>them with a sense of security and for ensuring them in the enjoyment of<br>what they possess, and always do what is agreeable to them. The king, O<br>Bharata, should always act in such a way towards the Vaisyas that their<br>productive powers may be enhanced. The Vaisyas increase the strength of a<br>kingdom, improve its agriculture, and develop its trade. A wise king,<br>therefore, should always gratify them. Acting with heedfulness and<br>leniency, he should levy mild imposts upon them. It is always easy to<br>behave with goodness towards the Vaisyas. There is nothing productive of<br>greater good to a kingdom, O Yudhishthira, then the adoption of such<br>behaviour towards the Vaisyas of the realm.'"
