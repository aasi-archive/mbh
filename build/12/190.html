                            "Bhrigu said, 'Truth is Brahma; Truth is Penance; it is Truth that<br>creates all creatures. It is by Truth that the whole universe is upheld;<br>and it is with the aid of Truth that one goes to heaven. Untruth is only<br>another form of Darkness. It is Darkness that leads downwards. Those who<br>are afflicted by Darkness and covered by it fail to behold the lighted<br>regions of heaven. It has been said that Heaven is Light and that Hell is<br>Darkness. The creatures that dwell in the universe may obtain both heaven<br>and hell. In this world also, truth and untruth lead to opposite courses<br>of conduct and opposite indications, such as Righteousness and<br>Unrighteousness, light and darkness, pleasure and pain. Amongst these,<br>that which is Truth is Righteousness; that which is Righteousness is<br>Light; and that which is Light is Happiness. Similarly, that which is<br>Untruth is Unrighteousness; that which is Unrighteousness is Darkness;<br>and that which is Darkness is Sorrow or Misery. In this respect it is<br>said that they that are possessed of wisdom, beholding that the world of<br>lire is overwhelmed with sorrow, both bodily and mental, and with<br>happiness that is sure to end in misery, never suffer themselves to be<br>stupefied. He that is Wise will strive to rescue himself from sorrow. The<br>happiness of living creatures is unstable both here and hereafter.[568]<br>The happiness of creatures that are overwhelmed by Darkness disappears<br>like the splendour of the Moon when afflicted by Rahu.[569] Happiness is<br>said to be of two kinds, viz., bodily and mental. Both in this and the<br>other world, the visible and the invisible fruits (of action) are<br>specified (in the Vedas) for the sake of happiness.[570] There is nothing<br>more important than happiness and among the fruits or consequences of the<br>triple aggregate. Happiness is desirable. It is an attribute of the Soul.<br>Both Virtue and Profit are sought for its sake. Virtue is its root. This,<br>indeed, is its origin. All acts have for their end the attainment of<br>happiness.'<br><br>"Bharadwaja said, 'You have said that happiness is the highest object, I<br>do not comprehend this. This attribute of the soul that (you say) is so<br>desirable is not sought by the Rishis who are regarded to be engaged in<br>something promising a higher reward. It is heard that the Creator of the<br>three worlds, viz., the puissant Brahman, lives alone, observant of the<br>vow of Brahmacharya. He never devotes himself to the happiness obtainable<br>from the gratification of desire. Also, the divine Master of the<br>universe, the lord of Uma, reduced Kama (the deity of desire) to<br>extinction. For this reason, we say that happiness is not acceptable to<br>high-souled people. Nor does it appear to be a high attribute of the<br>Soul. I cannot put faith in what thy divine self has said, viz., that<br>there is nothing higher than happiness. That there are two kinds of<br>consequences in respect of our acts, viz., the springing of happiness<br>from good acts and of sorrow from sinful, acts, is only a saying that is<br>current in the world.'<br><br>"Bhrigu said, 'On this it is said as follows: from Untruth springs<br>Darkness. They that are overwhelmed by Darkness pursue only<br>Unrighteousness and not Righteousness, being overmastered by wrath,<br>covetousness, malice, falsehood, and similar evils. They never obtain<br>happiness either here or hereafter, On the other hand, they are afflicted<br>by various kinds of disease and pain and trouble. They are also tortured<br>by Death, imprisonment, and diverse other griefs of that kind, and by the<br>sorrows, attending on hunger and thirst and toil. They are also pained by<br>the numerous bodily griefs that arise from rain and wind and burning heat<br>and exceeding cold. They are also overwhelmed by numerous mental griefs<br>caused by loss of wealth and separation from friends, as also by griefs<br>caused by decrepitude and death. They that are not touched by these<br>diverse kinds of physical and mental afflictions, know what happiness is.<br>These evils are never found in heaven. There delicious breezes blow. In<br>heaven there is also perpetual fragrance. In heaven there is no hunger,<br>no thirst, no decrepitude, no sin. In this world there is both happiness<br>and misery. In hell there is only misery. Therefore, happiness is the<br>highest object of acquisition. The Earth is the progenitrix of all<br>creatures. Females partake of her nature. The male animal is like<br>Prajapati himself. The vital seed, it should be known, is the creative<br>energy. In this way did Brahman ordain in days of old that the creation<br>should go on. Each, affected by his own acts, obtains happiness or<br>misery.'"[571]
