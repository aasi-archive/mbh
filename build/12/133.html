                            "Bhishma said, 'The king should, by drawing wealth from his own kingdom<br>as also from the kingdoms of his foes, fill his treasury. From the<br>treasury springs his religious merit, O son of Kunti, and it is in<br>consequence of the treasury that the roots of his kingdom extend. For<br>these reasons the treasury must be filled; and when filled; it should be<br>carefully protected (by putting a stop to all useless expenditure), and<br>even sought to be increased. This is the eternal practice. The treasury<br>cannot be filled by (acting with) purity and righteousness, nor by<br>(acting with) heartless cruelty. It should be filled by adopting a middle<br>course. How can a weak king have a treasury? How again can a king who has<br>no treasury have strength? How can a weak man have kingdom? Whence again<br>can one without a kingdom obtain prosperity? For a person of high rank,<br>adversity is like death. For this reason the king should always increase<br>his treasury, and army, and allies and friends. All men disregard a king<br>with an empty treasury. Without being gratified with the little that such<br>a king can give, his servants never express any alacrity in his business.<br>In consequence of his affluence, the king succeeds in obtaining great<br>honours. Indeed, affluence conceals his very sins, like robes concealing<br>such parts of a feminine form as should not be exposed to the view. Those<br>with whom the king has formerly quarrelled become filled with grief at<br>the sight of his new affluence. Like dogs they once more take service<br>under him, and though they wait only for an opportunity to slay him, he<br>takes to them as if nothing has happened. How, O Bharata, can such a king<br>obtain happiness? The king should always exert for acquiring greatness.<br>He should never bend down in humility.[401] Exertion is manliness. He<br>should rather break at an unfavourable opportunity than bend before any<br>one. He should rather repair to the forest and live therewith the wild<br>animals. But he should not still live in the midst of ministers and<br>officers who have like robbers broken through all restraints. Even the<br>robbers of the forest may furnish a large number of soldiers for the<br>accomplishment of the fiercest of deeds. O Bharata! If the king<br>transgresses all wholesome restraints, all people become filled with<br>alarm. The very robbers who know not what compassion is, dread such a<br>king.[402] For this reason, the king: should always establish rules and<br>restraints for gladdening the hearts of his people. Rules in respect of<br>even very trivial matters are hailed with delight by the people. There<br>are men who think that this world is nothing and the future also is a<br>myth. He that is an atheist of this type, though his heart is agitated by<br>secret fears, should never be trusted. If the robbers of the forest,<br>while observing other virtues, commit depredations in respect only of<br>property, those depredations may be regarded as harmless. The lives of<br>thousands of creatures are protected in consequence of robbers observing<br>such restraints. Slaying an enemy who is flying away from battle,<br>ravishment of wives, ingratitude, plundering the property of a Brahmana,<br>depriving a person of the whole of his property, violation of maidens,<br>continued occupation of villages and towns as their lawful lords, and<br>adulterous congress with other people's wives&#8212;these are regarded as<br>wicked acts among even robbers, and robbers should always abstain from<br>them. It is again certain that those kings who strive (by making peace)<br>to inspire confidence upon themselves in the hearts of the robbers,<br>succeed, after watching all their ins and outs, in exterminating them.<br>For this reason, in dealing with robbers, it is necessary that they<br>should not be exterminated outright.[403] They should be sought to be<br>brought under the king's way. The king should never behave with cruelty<br>towards them, thinking that he is more powerful than they. Those kings<br>that do not exterminate them outright have no fear of extermination to<br>themselves. They, however, that do exterminate them have always to live<br>in fear in consequence of that act.'"
