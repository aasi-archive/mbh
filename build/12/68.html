                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Why, O bull of Bharata's race, have the Brahmanas<br>said that the king, that ruler of men, is a god?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection, is cited the old story, O Bharata, of<br>the discourse of Vrihaspati unto Vasumanas. There was a king of Kosala<br>possessed of great intelligence, named Vasumanas. On a certain occasion<br>he questioned the great sage Vrihaspati of much wisdom. Conversant with<br>the requirements of humility, king Vasumanas, ever devoted to the welfare<br>of all, having observed the proper humilities and having circumambulated<br>the great sage and bowed unto him duly, enquired of the virtuous<br>Vrihaspati about the ordinances in respect of a kingdom, moved by the<br>desire of securing the happiness of men.'<br><br>"Vasumanas said, 'By what means do creatures grow and by what are they<br>destroyed? O thou of great wisdom, by adoring whom do they succeed in<br>obtaining eternal happiness?' Thus questioned by the Kosala king of<br>immeasurable energy, Vrihaspati of great wisdom discoursed unto him<br>coolly about the respect that should be paid to kings.<br><br>"Vrihaspati said, 'The duties of all men, O thou of great wisdom, may be<br>seen to have their root in the king. It is through fear of the king only<br>that men do not devour one another. It is the king that brings peace on<br>earth, through due observance of duties, by checking all disregard for<br>wholesome restraints and all kinds of lust. Achieving this, he shines in<br>glory. As, O king, all creatures become unable to see one another and<br>sink in utter darkness if the sun and the moon do not rise, as fishes in<br>shallow water and birds in a spot safe from danger dart and rove as they<br>please (for a time) and repeatedly attack and grind one another with<br>force and then meet with certain destruction even so men sink in utter<br>darkness and meet with destruction if they have no king to protect them,<br>like a herd of cattle without the herdsman to look after them. If the<br>king did not exercise the duty of protection, the strong would forcibly<br>appropriate the possessions of the weak, and if the latter refused to<br>surrender them with ease, their very lives would be taken. Nobody then,<br>with reference to any article in his possession, would be able to say<br>'This is mine.' Wives, sons, food, and other kinds of property, would not<br>then exist. Ruin would overtake everything if the king did not exercise<br>the duty of protection. Wicked men would forcibly appropriate the<br>vehicles and robes and ornaments and precious stones and other kinds of<br>property belonging to others, if the king did not protect. In the absence<br>of protection by the king, diverse kinds of weapons would fall upon those<br>that are righteous in their practices, and unrighteousness would be<br>adopted by all. In the absence of royal protection men would disregard or<br>even injure their very mothers and fathers if aged, their very preceptors<br>and guests and seniors. If the king did not protect, all persons<br>possessed of wealth would have to encounter death, confinement, and<br>persecution, and the very idea of property would disappear. If the king<br>did not protect, everything would be exterminated prematurely, and every<br>part of the country would be overrun by robbers, and everybody would fall<br>into terrible hell. If the king did not protect, all restrictions about<br>marriage and intercourse (due to consanguinity and other kinds of<br>relationship) would cease; all affairs relating to agricultures and trade<br>would fall into confusion, morality would sink and be lost; and the three<br>Vedas would disappear. Sacrifices, duly completed with presents according<br>to the ordinance, would no longer be performed; no marriage would take<br>place; society itself would cease to exist, if the king did not exercise<br>the duty of protection. The very bulls would not cover cows and milk-jars<br>would not be churned, and men living by rearing kine would meet with<br>destruction, if the king did not exercise the duty of protection. In the<br>absence of royal protection, all things, inspired with fear and anxiety<br>and becoming senseless and uttering cries of woe, would meet with<br>destruction in no time. No sacrifices extending for a year and completed<br>with presents according to the ordinances would occur if the king did not<br>exercise the duty of protection. In the absence of royal protection<br>Brahmanas would never study the four Vedas or undergo austerities or be<br>cleansed by knowledge and rigid vows. In the absence of royal protection,<br>the slayer of a person guilty of the slaughter of a Brahmana would not<br>obtain any reward; on the other hand the person guilty of Brahmanicide<br>would enjoy perfect immunity. In the absence of royal protection, men<br>would snatch other people's wealth from their very hands, and all<br>wholesome barriers would be swept away, and everybody, inspired with<br>fear, would seek safety in flight. In the absence of royal protection,<br>all kinds of injustice would set in; an intermixture of castes would take<br>place; and famine would ravage the kingdom. In consequence again of royal<br>protection, men can everywhere sleep fearlessly and at their case without<br>shutting their houses and doors with bolts and bars. Nobody would hear<br>the evil speeches of others, far less actual assaults, if the king did<br>not righteously protect the earth.[213] If the king exercises the duty of<br>protection, women decked with ornament may fearlessly wander everywhere<br>without male relatives to attend upon them. Men become righteous and<br>without injuring serve one another because the king exercises the duty of<br>protection. In consequence of royal protection the members of the three<br>orders are enabled to perform high sacrifices and devote themselves to<br>the acquisition of learning with attention, The world depends upon<br>agriculture and trade and is protected by the Vedas. All these again are<br>duly protected by the king exercising his principal duty. Since the king,<br>taking a heavy load upon himself, protects his subjects with the aid of a<br>mighty force, it is for this that the people are able to live in<br>happiness. Who is there that will not worship him in whose existence the<br>people exist and in whose destruction the people are destroyed? That<br>person who does what is agreeable and beneficial to the king and who<br>bears (a share of) the burden of kingly duties that strike every caste<br>with fear, conquers both this and the other world.[214] That man who even<br>thinks of doing an injury to the king, without doubt meets with grief<br>here and goes to hell hereafter. No one should disregard the king by<br>taking him for a man, for he is really a high divinity in human form. The<br>king assumes five different forms according to five different occasions.<br>He becomes Agni, Aditya, Mrityu, Vaisravana, and Yama. When the king,<br>deceived by falsehood, burns with his fierce energy the sinful offenders<br>before him, he is then said to assume the form of Agni. When he observes<br>through his spies the acts of all persons and does what is for the<br>general good, he is then said to assume the form of Aditya. When he<br>destroys in wrath hundreds of wicked men with their sons, grandsons, and<br>relatives, he is then said to assume the form of the Destroyer. When he<br>restrains the wicked by inflicting upon them severe punishments and<br>favours the righteous by bestowing rewards upon them, he is then said to<br>assume the form of Yama. When he gratifies with profuse gifts of wealth<br>those that have rendered him valuable services, and snatches away the<br>wealth and precious stones of those that have offended him, indeed, when<br>he bestows prosperity upon some and takes it away from others, he is<br>then, O king, said to assume the form of Kuvera on earth. No person who<br>is possessed of cleverness, who is capable of work, who desires the<br>acquisition of virtue, and who is free from malice, should ever spread<br>evil reports about the king. No man, by acting against the king, can ever<br>make himself happy, even if he happens to be the king's son or brother or<br>companion or one whom the king regards as his second self. Fire, having<br>the wind for his urger, blazing forth (among articles that are<br>inflammable), may leave a remnant.[215] The wrath of the king, however,<br>leaves not anything to the person that incurs it. Whatever belongs to the<br>king should be avoided from distance.[216] One should turn away from what<br>belongs to the king as he would from death itself. A person by<br>appropriating what belongs to the king speedily meets with destruction<br>like a deer upon touching poison. The man of intelligence should protect<br>as his own what belongs to the kin.. They that appropriate wealth<br>belonging to the king sink senseless into a deep hell of eternal gloom<br>and infamy. Who is there that will not worship the king who is adored by<br>such terms as delighter of the people, giver of happiness, possessor of<br>prosperity, the foremost of all, healer of injuries, lord of earth, and<br>protector of men? That man, therefore, who desires his own prosperity,<br>who observes all wholesome restraints, who has his soul under control,<br>who is the master of his passions, who is possessed of intelligence and<br>memory, and who is clever (in the transaction of business), should always<br>be attached to the king. The king should duly honour the minister who is<br>grateful, endued with wisdom, large-hearted, loyal, possessed of mastery<br>over his senses, virtuous, and observant of the dictates of policy. The<br>king should entertain the man who is loyal, grateful, virtuous, possessed<br>of self-control, brave, magnanimous in his acts, and competent to<br>accomplish tasks without the assistance of others. Knowledge makes men<br>proud. The king makes men humble. The man who is afflicted by the king<br>can never obtain happiness. On the other hand, the man who is favoured by<br>the king becomes happy. The king is the heart of his people; he is their<br>great refuge; he is their glory; and he is their highest happiness. Those<br>men, O monarch, who are attached to the king, succeed in conquering both<br>this and the other world. Having governed the earth with the aid of the<br>qualities of self-restraint, truth, and friendship, and having adored the<br>gods by great sacrifices, the king, earning great glory, obtains an<br>eternal abode in heaven.' That best of monarchs, viz., the heroic<br>Vasumanas, ruler of Kosala, thus instructed by Vrihaspati the son of<br>Angiras, began thenceforth to protect his subjects."
