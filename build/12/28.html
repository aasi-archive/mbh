                            Vaisampayana said, "Vyasa then dispelled the grief of the eldest son of<br>Pandu., who, burning with sorrow on account of the slaughter of his<br>kinsmen, had resolved to make an end of himself."<br><br>Vyasa said, 'In this connection is cited the old story, O tiger among<br>men, that is known by the name of Asma's discourse. Listen to it, O<br>Yudhishthira! Janaka the ruler of the Videhas, O king, filled with sorrow<br>and grief, questioned a wise Brahmana of the name of Asma for the<br>resolution of his doubts.'<br><br>"Janaka said, 'How should a man desirous of his own good behave upon<br>occasions of the accession and the destruction of both kinsmen and<br>wealth?'<br><br>"Asma said, 'Immediately after the formation of a man's body, joys and<br>griefs attach themselves to it. Although there is a possibility of either<br>of the two overtaking the person, yet whichever actually overtakes him<br>quickly robs him of his reason like the wind driving away gathering<br>clouds. (In times of prosperity) one thinks in this strain, viz., 'I am<br>of high birth! I can do whatever I like!&#8212;I am not an ordinary man!' His<br>mind becomes soaked with such triple vanity. Addicted to all earthly<br>enjoyments, he begins to waste the wealth hoarded by his ancestors.<br>Impoverished in course of time, he regards the appropriation of what<br>belongs to others as even laudable. Like a hunter piercing a deer with<br>his shafts, the king then punishes that wicked wight that robber of other<br>people's possessions, that transgressor of law and rule. Without<br>attaining to a hundred years (the usual period of human life), such men<br>scarcely live beyond twenty or thirty years. Carefully observing the<br>behaviour of all creatures, a king should, by the exercise of his<br>intelligence, apply remedies for alleviating the great sorrows of his<br>subjects. The causes of all mental sorrow are two, viz., delusion of the<br>mind and the accession of distress. No third cause exists. All these<br>diverse kinds of woe as also those arising from attachment to earthly<br>enjoyments, that overtake man, are even such.[79] Decrepitude and Death,<br>like a pair of wolves, devour all creatures, strong or weak, short or<br>tall. No man can escape decrepitude and death, not even the subjugator of<br>the whole earth girt by the sea. Be it happiness or be it sorrow that<br>comes upon creatures., it should be enjoyed or borne without elation or<br>depression. There is no method of escape from them. The evils of life, O<br>king, overtake one in early or middle or old age. They can never he<br>avoided, while those (sources of bliss) that are coveted never come.[80]<br>The absence, of what is agreeable, the presence of what is disagreeable,<br>good and evil, bliss and woe, follow Destiny. Similarly, the birth of<br>creatures and their death, and the accessions of gain and loss, are all<br>pre-ordained. Even as scent, colour, taste, and touch spring naturally,<br>happiness and misery arise from what has been pre-ordained. Seats and<br>beds and vehicles, prosperity and drink and food, ever approach leaving<br>creatures according to Time's course.[81] Physicians even get ill. The<br>strong become weak. They that are in the enjoyment of prosperity lose all<br>and become indigent. The course of Time is very wonderful. High birth,<br>health, beauty, prosperity, and objects of enjoyment, are all won through<br>Destiny. The indigent, although they may not desire it, have many<br>children. The affluent again are seen to be childless. Wonderful is the<br>course of Destiny. The evils caused by disease, fire, water, weapons,<br>hunger, poison, fever, and death, and falls from high places, overtake a<br>man according to the Destiny under which he is born. It is seen in this<br>world that somebody without sinning, suffers diverse ills, while another,<br>having sinned, is not borne down by the weight of calamity. It is seen<br>that somebody in the enjoyment of wealth perishes in youth; while some<br>one that is poor drags on his existence, borne down by decrepitude, for a<br>hundred years. One borne in an ignoble race may have a very long life,<br>while one sprung from a noble line perishes soon like an insect. In this<br>world, it is very common that persons in affluent circumstances have no<br>appetite, while they that are indigent can digest chips of wood. Impelled<br>by destiny, whatever sins the man of wicked soul, discontented with his<br>condition, commits, saying, 'I am the doer,' he regards to be all for his<br>good. Hunting, dice, women, wine, brawls, these are censured by the wise.<br>Many persons, however, possessed of even extensive knowledge of the<br>scriptures are seen to be addicted to them. Objects, whether coveted or<br>otherwise, come upon creatures in consequence of Time's course. No other<br>cause can be traced. Air, space, fire, moon, sun, day, night, the<br>luminous bodies (in the firmament), rivers, and mountains,&#8212;who makes<br>them and who supports them? Cold, and heat, and rain, come one after<br>another in consequence of Time's course. It is even so, O bull among men,<br>with the happiness and the misery of mankind. Neither medicines, nor<br>incantations, can rescue the man assailed by decrepitude or overtaken by<br>death. As two logs of wood floating on the great ocean, come together and<br>are again (when the time comes) separated, even so creatures come<br>together and are again (when the time comes) separated. Time acts equally<br>towards those men that (are in affluent circumstances and that) enjoy the<br>pleasures of song and dance in the company of women and those helpless<br>men that live upon the food that others supply. In this world a thousand<br>kinds of relationship are contracted, such as mother and father and son<br>and wife. In reality, however, whose are they and whose are we? No one<br>can become anyone's own, nor can anyone become anybody else's own. Our<br>union herewith wives and kinsfolk and well-wishers is like that of<br>travellers at a road-side inn. Where am I? Where shall go? Who am I? How<br>come I here! What for and whom I grieve? Reflecting on these questions<br>one obtains tranquillity. Life and its environments are constantly<br>revolving like a wheel, and the companionship of those that are dear is<br>transitory. The union with brother, mother, father, and friend is like<br>that of travellers in an inn. Men of knowledge behold, as if with<br>corporeal eyes, the next world that is unseen. Without disregarding the<br>scriptures, one desirous of knowledge should have faith. One possessed of<br>knowledge should perform the rites laid down in respect of the Pitris and<br>the gods, practise all religious duties, perform sacrifices, judiciously<br>pursue virtue, profit, and pleasure. Alas, no one understands that the<br>world is sinking on the ocean of Time that is so very deep and that is<br>infested with those huge crocodiles called decrepitude and death. Many<br>physicians may be seen afflicted with all the members of their families,<br>although they have carefully studied the science of Medicine.[82] Taking<br>bitters and diverse kinds of oily drugs, these succeed not in escaping<br>death, like ocean in transcending its continents. Men well-versed in<br>chemistry, notwithstanding chemical compounds applied judiciously, are<br>seen to be broken down by decrepitude like trees broken down by<br>elephants. Similarly, persons possessed of ascetic merit, devoted to<br>study of the Vedas, practising charity, and frequently performing<br>sacrifices, succeed not in escaping decrepitude and death. As regards all<br>creatures that have taken birth, neither years, nor months, nor<br>fortnights, nor days, nor nights, that have once passed, do ever return.<br>Man, whose existence is so transitory, is forced, in course of Time,<br>whether he will or not, to come upon this inevitable and broad path that<br>has to be trodden by every creature.[83] Whether the body springs from<br>the creature or the creature springs from the body, one's union however,<br>with wives and other friends is like that of travellers in an inn.[84]<br>one cannot obtain a lasting companionship with anyone. One cannot obtain<br>such companionship with one's own body. How then it can be had with<br>anyone else? Where, O king, is thy sire today and where thy grandsire?<br>Thou beholdst them not today and they do not behold thee. O sinless one!<br>No person can see either heaven or hell. The scriptures, however, are the<br>eyes of the virtuous. O king, frame thy conduct according to the<br>scriptures. What pure heart, one should practise first the vow of<br>Brahmacharya and then beget children and then perform sacrifices, for<br>paying off the debt one owes to the Pitris, the gods, and men. Performing<br>sacrifices and engaged in procreating (children), after having first<br>observed the vow of Brahmacharya, one who bath wisdom for his eyes,<br>casting off all anxiety of heart, should pay court to heaven, this world,<br>and his own soul.[85] That king bent upon the practice of virtue who<br>strives judiciously for acquiring Heaven and Earth and who takes of<br>earthly goods just what is ordained (as the king's share) in the<br>scriptures, wins a reputation that spread over all the worlds and among<br>all creatures, mobile and immobile. The ruler of the Videhas, of clear<br>understanding, having heard these words full of reason, become freed from<br>grief, and taking Asma's leave proceeded towards his abode, O thou of<br>unfading glory, cast off thy grief and rise up. Thou art equal to Sakra<br>himself. Suffer thy soul to be gladdened. The earth has been won by thee<br>in the exercise of Kshatriya duties. Enjoy her, O son of Kunti, and do<br>not disregard my words.'"
