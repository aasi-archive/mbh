                            "Bhishma said, 'Hearing these sweet words, Gautama became filled with<br>wonder. Feeling at the same time a great curiosity, he eyed Rajadharman<br>without being able to withdraw his gaze from him.'<br><br>"Rajadharman said, 'O Brahmana, I am the son of Kasyapa by one of the<br>daughters of (the sage) Daksha. Possessed of great merits, thou art my<br>guest today. Thou art welcome, O foremost of Brahmanas!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Having offered him hospitality according to the<br>rites laid down in the scriptures, the crane made an excellent bed of the<br>Sala flowers that lay all around. He also offered him several large<br>fishes caught from the deep waters of the Bhagirathi. Indeed, the son of<br>Kasyapa offered, for the acceptance of his guest Gautama a blazing fire<br>and certain large fishes. After the Brahmana had eaten and became<br>gratified, the bird possessing wealth of penances began to fan him with<br>his wings for driving off his fatigue. Seeing his guest seated at his<br>case, he asked him about his pedigree. The man answered, saying, 'I am a<br>Brahmana known by the name of Gautama,' and then remained silent. The<br>bird gave his guest a soft bed made of leaves and perfumed with many<br>fragrant flowers. Gautama laid himself down on it, and felt great<br>happiness. When Gautama had laid himself down, the eloquent son of<br>Kasyapa, who resembled Yama himself in his knowledge of duties, asked him<br>a bout the cause of his arrival there. Gautama answered him, saying, 'I<br>am, O large-souled one, very poor. For earning wealth[494] I am desirous<br>of going to the sea.' The son of Kasyapa cheerfully told him: 'It<br>behoveth thee not to feel any anxiety. Thou shalt succeed, O foremost of<br>Brahmanas, and shalt return home with properly. The sage Vrihaspati hath<br>spoken of four kinds of means for the acquisition of wealth, viz.,<br>inheritance, sudden accession due to luck or the favour of the gods,<br>acquisition by labour, and acquisition through the aid or kindness of<br>friends. I have become thy friend. I cherish good feelings towards thee.<br>I shall, therefore, exert myself in such a way that thou mayst succeed in<br>acquiring wealth. The night passed away and morning came. Seeing his<br>guest rise cheerfully from bed, the bird addressed him, saying, 'Go, O<br>amiable one, along this very route and thou art sure to succeed. At the<br>distance of about three Yojanas from this place, there is a mighty king<br>of the Rakshasas. Possessed of great strength, his name is Virupaksha,<br>and he is a friend of mine. Go to him, O foremost of Brahmanas! That<br>chief, induced by my request, will, without doubt, give thee as much<br>wealth as thou desirest.' Thus addressed, O king, Gautama cheerfully set<br>out from that place, eating on the way, to his fill, fruits sweet as<br>ambrosia. Beholding the sandal and aloe and birch trees that stood along<br>the road, and enjoying their refreshing shade, the Brahmana proceeded<br>quickly. He then reached the city known by the name of Meruvraja. It had<br>large porches made of stone, and high walls of the same material. It was<br>also surrounded on every side with a trench, and large pieces of rock and<br>engines of many kinds were kept ready on the ramparts. He soon became<br>known to the Rakshasa chief of great intelligence, O king, as a dear<br>guest sent unto him by the chief's friend (the crane). The chief received<br>Gautama very gladly. The king of the Rakshasas then, O Yudhishthira,<br>commanded his attendants, saying, 'Let Gautama be soon brought hither<br>from the gate.' At the command of the king, certain persons, quick as<br>hawks, issued from the splendid palace of their ruler, and proceeding to<br>the gate accosted Gautama. The royal messengers, O monarch, said unto<br>that Brahmana, 'Come quickly, the king desires to see thee. Thou mayst<br>have heard of the king of the Rakshasas, Virupaksha, by name, possessed<br>of great courage. Even he is impatient of seeing thee. Come quickly and<br>tarry not.' Thus addressed, the Brahmana, forgetting his toil in his<br>surprise, ran with the messengers. Beholding the great affluence of the<br>city, he became filled with wonder. Soon he entered the king's palace in<br>the company of the messengers solicitous of obtaining a sight of the king<br>of the Rakshasas.'"
