                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Brahmanas and Rishis and Pitris and the gods all<br>applaud the duty of truth. I desire to hear of truth. Discourse to me<br>upon it, O grandsire! What are the indications, O king, of truth? How may<br>it be acquired? What is gained by practising truth, and how? Tell me all<br>this.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'A confusion of the duties of the four orders is never<br>applauded. That which is called Truth always exists in a pure and<br>unmingled state in every one of those four orders. With those that are<br>good, Truth is always a duty. Indeed, Truth is an eternal duty. One<br>should reverentially bow unto Truth. Truth is the highest refuge (of<br>all). Truth is duty; Truth is penance; Truth is Yoga; and Truth is the<br>eternal Brahma. Truth has been said to be Sacrifice of a high order.[464]<br>Everything rests upon Truth. I shall now tell thee the forms of Truths<br>one after another, and its indications also in due order. It behoveth<br>thee to hear also as to how Truth may be acquired. Truth, O Bharata, as<br>it exists in all the world, is of thirteen kinds. The forms that Truth<br>assumes are impartiality, self control, forgiveness, modesty, endurance,<br>goodness, renunciation, contemplation, dignity, fortitude, compassion,<br>and abstention from injury. These, O great monarch, are the thirteen<br>forms of Truth. Truth is immutable, eternal, and unchangeable. It may be<br>acquired through practices which do not militate against any of the other<br>virtues. It may also be acquired through Yoga. When desire and aversion,<br>as also lust and wrath, are destroyed, that attribute in consequence of<br>which one is able to look upon one's own self and one's foe, upon one's<br>good and one's evil, with an unchanging eye, is called impartiality.<br>Self-control consists in never wishing for another man's possessions, in<br>gravity and patience and capacity to allay the fears of others in respect<br>to one's own self, and immunity from disease. It may be acquired through<br>knowledge. Devotion to the practice of liberality and the observance of<br>all duties are regarded by the wise as constituting goodwill. One comes<br>to acquire universal goodwill by constant devotion to truth. As regards<br>non-forgiveness and forgiveness, it should be stated that the attribute<br>through which an esteemed and good man endures both what is agreeable and<br>disagreeable, is said to be forgiveness. This virtue may well be acquired<br>through the practice of truthfulness. That virtue in consequence of which<br>an intelligent man, contented in mind and speech, achieves many good<br>deeds and never incurs the censure of others, is called modesty. It is<br>acquired through the aid of righteousness. That virtue which forgives for<br>the sake of virtue and profit is called endurance. It is a form of<br>forgiveness. It is acquired through patience, and its purpose is to<br>attach people to one's self. The casting off of affection as also of all<br>earthly possessions, is called renunciation. Renunciation can never be<br>acquired except by one who is divested of anger and malice. That virtue<br>in consequence of which one does good, with watchfulness and care, to all<br>creatures is called goodness. It hath no particular shape and consists in<br>the divestment of all selfish attachments. That virtue owing to which one<br>remains unchanged in happiness and misery is called fortitude. That wise<br>man who desires his own good always practises this virtue. One should<br>always practise forgiveness and devotedness to truth. That man of wisdom<br>who succeeds in casting off joy and fear and wrath, succeeds in acquiring<br>fortitude. Abstention from injury as regards all creatures in thought,<br>word, and deed, kindness, and gift, are the eternal duties of those who<br>are good. These thirteen attributes, though apparently distinct from one<br>another, have but one and the same form, viz., Truth. All these, O<br>Bharata, support Truth and strengthen it. It is impossible, O monarch, to<br>exhaust the merits of Truth. It is for these reasons that the Brahmanas,<br>the Pitris, and the gods, applaud Truth. There is no duty which is higher<br>than Truth, and no sin more heinous than untruth. Indeed, Truth is the<br>very foundation of righteousness. For this reason, one should never<br>destroy Truth. From Truth proceed gifts, and sacrifice with presents, as<br>well as the threefold Agnihotras, the Vedas, and everything else that<br>leads to righteousness. Once on a time a thousand horse-sacrifices and<br>Truth were weighed against each other in the balance. Truth weighed<br>heavier than a thousand horse-sacrifices."'
