                            "Bhishma said, 'Let not such trees as yield edible fruits be cut down in<br>thy dominions. Fruits and roots constitute the property of the Brahmanas.<br>The sages have declared this to be an ordinance of religion. The surplus,<br>after supporting the Brahmanas, should go to the support of other people.<br>Nobody should take anything by doing an injury to the Brahmanas.[257] If<br>a Brahmana, afflicted for want of support, desires to abandon a kingdom<br>for obtaining livelihood (elsewhere), the king, O monarch, should, with<br>affection and respect, assign unto him the means of sustenance. If he<br>does not still abstain (from leaving the kingdom), the king should repair<br>to an assembly of Brahmanas and say, 'Such a Brahmana is leaving the<br>kingdom. In whom shall my people then find an authority for guiding<br>them?'[258] If after this, he does not give up his intention of leaving,<br>and says anything, the king should say unto him, 'Forget the past.' This,<br>O son of Kunti, is the eternal way of royal duty.[259] The king should<br>further say unto him, 'Indeed, O Brahmana, people say that that only<br>should be assigned to a Brahmana which would be just sufficient for<br>maintaining him. I, however, do not accept that opinion. On the other<br>hand, I think that if a Brahmana seeks to leave a kingdom for the king's<br>neglect in providing him with means of support, such means should be<br>assigned to him, and, further, if he intends to take that step for<br>procuring the means of luxury, he should still be requested to stay and<br>supplied with ever those means.[260] Agriculture, cattle-rearing, and<br>trade, provide all men with the means of living. A knowledge of the<br>Vedas, however, provide them with the means of obtaining heaven. They,<br>therefore, that obstruct the study of the Vedas and the cause of Vedic<br>practices, are to be regarded as enemies of society.[261] It is for the<br>extermination of these that Brahman created Kshatriyas. Subdue thy foes,<br>protect thy subjects, worship the deities in sacrifices, and fight<br>battles with courage, O delighter of the Kurus! A king should protect<br>those that deserve protection. The king who does this is the best of<br>rulers. Those kings that do not exercise the duty of protection live a<br>vain life. For the benefit of all his subjects the king should always<br>seek to ascertain the acts and thoughts of all, O Yudhishthira; and for<br>that reason fie should set spies and secret agents.[262] Protecting<br>others from thy own, and thy own from others, as also others from others,<br>and thy own from thy own, do thou always cherish thy people. Protecting<br>his own self first from every one, the king should protect the earth. Men<br>of knowledge have said that everything has its root in self. The king<br>should always reflect upon these, viz., What are his laches, to what evil<br>habits he is addicted, what are the sources of his weakness, and what are<br>the sources of his faults. The king should cause secret and trusted<br>agents to wander through the kingdom for ascertaining whether his conduct<br>as displayed on the previous day has or has not met with the approbation<br>of the people. Indeed, he should ascertain whether his conduct is or is<br>not generally praised, or, is or is not acceptable to the people of the<br>provinces, and whether he has or has not succeeded in earning a good name<br>in his kingdom. Amongst those that are virtuous and possessed of wisdom,<br>those that never retreat from battle, and those that do not reside in thy<br>kingdom, those that are dependent on thee, and those that are thy<br>ministers, as well as those that are independent of party, they that<br>praise or blame thee should never be objects of disregard with thee, O<br>Yudhishthira![263] No man, O sire, can succeed in earning the good<br>opinion of all persons in the world. All persons have friends, foes, and<br>neutrals, O Bharata!'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Among persons all of whom are equal in might of arms<br>and accomplishments, whence does one acquire superiority over all the<br>rest, and whence does that one succeed in ruling over them?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Creatures that are mobile devour things that are<br>immobile; animals again that have teeth devour those that have no teeth;<br>wrathful snakes of virulent poison devour smaller ones of their own<br>species. (Upon this principle), among human beings also, the king, who is<br>strong, preys upon those that are weak. The king, O Yudhishthira, should<br>always be heedful of his subjects as also of his foes. If he becomes<br>heedless, they fall upon him like vultures (on carrion). Take care, O<br>king, that the traders in thy kingdom who purchase articles at prices<br>high and low (for sale), and who in course of their journeys have to<br>sleep or take rest in forest and inaccessible regions,[264] be not<br>afflicted by the imposition of heavy taxes. Let not the agriculturists in<br>thy kingdom leave it through oppression; they, who bear the burthens of<br>the king, support the other residents also of the kingdom.[265] The gifts<br>made by thee in this world support the gods, Pitris, men, Nagas,<br>Rakshasas, birds, and animals. These, O Bharata, are the means of<br>governing a kingdom and protecting its rulers. I shall again discourse to<br>thee on the subject, O son of Pandu!'"
