                            Vaisampayana said, "After this, Yudhishthira, saluted his grandsire, viz.<br>the son of Ganga, and with joined hands and concentrated attention, once<br>more asked him, saying, 'What are the general duties of the four orders<br>of men, and what the special duties of each order? What mode of life<br>should be adopted by which order? What duties are especially called the<br>duties of kings? By what means does a kingdom grow, and what are those<br>means by which the king himself grows? How also, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, do the citizens and the servants of the king grow? What sorts of<br>treasuries, punishments, forts, allies, counsellors, priests, and<br>preceptors, should a king avoid?[179] Whom should the king trust in what<br>kinds of distress and danger? From what evils should the king guard<br>himself firmly? Tell me all this, O grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I bow down to Dharma who is great, and to Krishna who is<br>Brahma. Having bowed down also unto the Brahmanas (assembled here), I<br>shall discourse on duties that are eternal. The suppression of wrath,<br>truthfulness of speech, justice, forgiveness, begetting children upon<br>one's own wedded wives, purity of conduct, avoidance of quarrel,<br>simplicity, and maintenance of dependants, these nine duties belong to<br>all the four orders (equally). Those duties, however, which belong<br>exclusively to Brahmanas, I shall now tell thee. Self-restraint, O king,<br>has been declared to be the first duty of Brahmanas. Study of the Vedas,<br>and patience in undergoing austerities, (are also their other duties). By<br>practising these two, all their acts are accomplished. If while engaged<br>in the observance of his own duties, without doing any improper act,<br>wealth comes to a peaceful Brahmana possessed of knowledge, he should<br>then marry and seek to beget children and should also practise charity<br>and perform sacrifices. It has been declared by the wise that wealth thus<br>obtained should be enjoyed by distributing it (among deserving persons<br>and relatives). By his study of the Vedas all the pious acts (laid down<br>for the Brahmana) are accomplished. Whether he does or does not achieve<br>anything else, if he devotes himself to the study of the Vedas, he<br>becomes (by that) known as a Brahmana or the friend of all creatures. I<br>shall also tell thee, O Bharata, what the duties are of a Kshatriya. A<br>Kshatriya, O king, should give but not beg, should himself perform<br>sacrifices but not officiate as a priest in the sacrifices of others. He<br>should never teach (the Vedas) but study (them with a Brahmana<br>preceptor). He should protect the people. Always exerting himself for the<br>destruction of robbers and wicked people, he should put forth his prowess<br>in battle. Those among Kshatriya rulers who perform great sacrifices, who<br>are possessed of a knowledge of the Vedas, and who gain victories in<br>battle, become foremost of those that acquire many blessed regions<br>hereafter by their merit. Persons conversant with the old scriptures do<br>not applaud that Kshatriya who returns unwounded from battle. This has<br>been declared to be the conduct of a wretched Kshatriya.[180] There is no<br>higher duty for him than the suppression of robbers. Gifts, study, and<br>sacrifices, bring prosperity to kings. Therefore, a king who desires to<br>acquire religious merit should engage in battle.[181] Establishing all<br>his subjects in the observance of their respective duties, it king should<br>cause all of them to do everything according to the dictates of<br>righteousness. Whether he does or does not do any other act, if only he<br>protects his subjects, he is regarded to accomplish all religious acts<br>and is called a Kshatriya and the foremost of men. I shall now tell thee,<br>O Yudhishthira, what the eternal duties of the Vaisya are. A Vaisya<br>should make gifts, study the Vedas, perform sacrifices, and acquire<br>wealth by fair means. With proper attention he should also protect and<br>rear all (domestic) animals as a sire protecting his sons. Anything else<br>that he will do will be regarded as improper for him. By protecting the<br>(domestic) animals, he would obtain great happiness. The Creator, having<br>created the (domestic) animals, bestowed their care upon the Vaisya. Upon<br>the Brahmana and the Kshatriya he conferred (the care of) all creatures.<br>I shall tell thee what the Vaisya's profession is and how he is to earn<br>the means of his sustenance. If he keeps (for others) six kine, he may<br>take the milk of one cow as his remuneration; and if he keeps (for<br>others) a hundred kine, he may take a single pair as such fee. If he<br>trades with other's wealth, he may take a seventh part of the profits (as<br>his share). A seventh also is his share in the profits arising from the<br>trade in horns, but he should take a sixteenth if the trade be in hoofs.<br>If he engages in cultivation with seeds supplied by others, he may take a<br>seventh part of the yield. This should be his annual remuneration. A<br>Vaisya should never desire that he should not tend cattle. If a Vaisya<br>desires to tend cattle, no one else should be employed in that task. I<br>should tell thee, O Bharata, what the duties of a Sudra are. The Creator<br>intended the Sudra to become the servant of the other three orders. For<br>this, the service of the three other classes is the duty of Sudra. By<br>such service of the other three, a Sudra may obtain great happiness. He<br>should wait upon the three other classes according to their order of<br>seniority. A Sudra should never amass wealth, lest, by his wealth, he<br>makes the members of the three superior classes obedient to him. By this<br>he would incur sin. With the king's permission, however, a Sudra, for<br>performing religious acts, may earn wealth. I shall now tell thee the<br>profession he should follow and the means by which he may earn his<br>livelihood. It is said that Sudras should certainly be maintained by the<br>(three) other orders. Worn-out umbrellas, turbans, beds and seats, shoes,<br>and fans, should be given to the Sudra servants.[182] Torn clothes which<br>are no longer fit for wear, should be given away by the regenerate<br>classes unto the Sudra. These are the latter's lawful acquisitions. Men<br>conversant with morality say that if the Sudra approaches any one<br>belonging to the three regenerate orders from desire of doing menial<br>service, the latter should assign him proper work. Unto the sonless Sudra<br>his master should offer the funeral cake. The weak and the old amongst<br>them should be maintained.[183] The Sudra should never abandon his<br>master, whatever the nature or degree of the distress into which the<br>latter may fall. If the master loses his wealth, he should with excessive<br>zeal be supported by the Sudra servant. A Sudra cannot have any wealth<br>that is his own. Whatever he possesses belongs lawfully to his<br>master.[184] Sacrifice has been laid down as a duty of the three other<br>orders. It has been ordained for the Sudra also, O Bharata! A Sudra,<br>however, is not competent to titter swaha and swadha or any other Vedic<br>mantra. For this reason, the Sudra, without observing the vows laid down<br>in the Vedas, should worship the gods in minor sacrifices called<br>Paka-yajnas. The gift called Purna-patra is declared to be the Dakshina<br>of such sacrifices.[185] It has been heard by us that in days of old a<br>Sudra of the name of Paijavana gave a Dakshina (in one of his sacrifices)<br>consisting of a hundred thousand Purnapatras, according to the ordinance<br>called Aindragni.[186] Sacrifice (as has been already said), is as much<br>laid down for the Sudra as for the three other classes. Of all<br>sacrifices, devotion has been laid down to be the foremost.[187] Devotion<br>is a high deity. It cleanses all sacrificers. Then again Brahmanas are<br>the foremost of gods unto their respective Sudra attendants. They worship<br>the gods in sacrifices, for obtaining the fruition of various wishes. The<br>members of the three other classes have all sprung from the<br>Brahmanas.[188] The Brahmanas are the gods of the very gods. Whatever<br>they would say would be for thy great good. Therefore, all kinds of<br>sacrifices naturally appertain to all the four orders. The obligation is<br>not one whose discharge is optional. The Brahmana, who is conversant with<br>Richs, Yajuses, and Samans, should always be worshipped as a god. The<br>Sudra, who is without Richs and Yajuses and Samans, has Prajapati for his<br>god.[189] Mental sacrifice. O sire, is laid down for all the orders, O<br>Bharata! It is not true that the gods and other (Superior) persons do not<br>manifest a desire to share the offerings in such sacrifices of even the<br>Sudra.[190] For, this reason, the sacrifice that consists in devotion is<br>laid down for all the classes.[191] The Brahmana is the foremost of gods.<br>It is not true that they that belong to that order do not perform the<br>sacrifices of the other orders. The fire called Vitana, though procured<br>from Vaisyas and inspired with mantras, is still inferior.[192] The<br>Brahmana is the performer or the sacrifices of the three other orders.<br>For this reason all the four orders are holy. All the orders bear towards<br>one another to relation of consanguinity, through the intermediate<br>classes. They have all sprung from Brahmanas. In ascertaining (the<br>priority or subsequence of men in respect of their creation) it will<br>appear that amongst all the orders the Brahmana was created first.<br>Originally Saman  was one; Yajus was one, and Rich was one.[193] In this<br>connection, persons conversant with ancient histories cite a verse, O<br>king, sung in praise of sacrifice by the Vaikhanasa Munis on the occasion<br>of performing a sacrifice of theirs. Before or after sunrise a person of<br>subdued senses, with heart filled with devotion, poureth libations on the<br>(sacrificial) fire according to the ordinance. Devotion is a mighty<br>agent. With regard to homas again, that variety which is called skanna is<br>the initial one, while that which is called askanna is the last (but<br>foremost in point of merit). Sacrifices are multifarious. Their rites and<br>fruits again are multifarious. The Brahmana possessed of devotion who,<br>endued with scriptural learning, who is acquainted with them all, is<br>competent to perform sacrifices. That person who desires to perform a<br>sacrifice is regarded as righteous even if he happens to be a thief, a<br>sinner, or the worst of sinners. The Rishis applaud such a man. Without<br>doubt they are right. This then is the conclusion that all the orders<br>should always and by every means in their power perform sacrifices. There<br>is nothing in the three worlds equal to sacrifice. Therefore, it has been<br>said that every one with heart free from malice, should perform<br>sacrifices, aided by devotion which is sacred, to the best of his power<br>and according as he pleases.'"
