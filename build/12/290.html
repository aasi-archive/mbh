                            "Yudhishthira said, 'This curiosity, O sire, is always dwelling in my<br>mind. O grandsire of the Kurus, I desire to hear everything about it from<br>thee. Why was the celestial Rishi, the high-souled Usanas, called also<br>Kavi engaged in doing what was agreeable to the Asuras and disagreeable<br>to the deities? Why was he engaged in diminishing the energy of the<br>deities? Why were the Danavas always engaged in hostilities with the<br>foremost of the deities? Possessed of the splendour of an immortal, for<br>what reason did Usanas obtain the name of Sukra? How also did he acquire<br>such superior excellence? Tell me all about these things. Though<br>possessed of great energy, why does he not succeed in travelling to the<br>centre of the firmament? I desire, O grandsire, to learn everything about<br>all these matters.'[1489]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O king, with attention to all this as it occurred<br>actually. O sinless one, I shall narrate these matters to thee as I have<br>heard and understood them. Of firm vows and honoured by all, Usanas, that<br>descendant of Bhrigu's race, became engaged in doing what was<br>disagreeable to the deities for an adequate cause.[1490] The royal<br>Kuvera, the chief of the Yakshas and the Rakshasas, is the lord of the<br>treasury of Indra, that master of the universe.[1491] The great ascetic<br>Usanas, crowned with Yoga-success, entered the person of Kuvera, and<br>depriving the lord of treasures of his liberty by means of Yoga, robbed<br>him of all his wealth.[1492] Seeing his wealth taken away from him, the<br>lord of treasures became highly displeased. Filled with anxiety, and his<br>wrath also being excited, he went to that foremost of gods, viz.,<br>Mahadeva. Kuvera, represented the matter unto Siva of immeasurable<br>energy, that first of gods, fierce and amiable, and possessed of various<br>forms. And he said, 'Usanas, having spiritualised himself by Yoga entered<br>my form and depriving myself of liberty, has taken away all my wealth.<br>Having by Yoga entered my body he has again left it.' Hearing these<br>words, Maheswara of supreme Yoga-powers became filled with rage. His<br>eyes, O king, became blood-red, and taking up his lance he waited (ready<br>to strike down Usanas). Indeed, having taken up that foremost of weapons,<br>the great god began to say, 'Where is he? Where is he?' Meanwhile,<br>Usanas, having ascertained the purpose of Mahadeva (through Yoga-power)<br>from a distance, waited in silence. Indeed, having ascertained the fact<br>of the wrath of the high-souled Maheswara of superior Yoga-power, the<br>puissant Usanas began to reflect as to whether he should go to Maheswara<br>or fly away or remain where he was. Thinking, with the aid of his severe<br>penances, of the high-souled Mahadeva, Usanas of soul crowned with<br>Yoga-success, placed himself on the point of Mahadeva's lance. The<br>bow-armed Rudra, understanding that Usanas, whose penances had become<br>successful and who had converted himself into the form of pure Knowledge,<br>was staying at the point of his lance (and finding that he was unable to<br>hurl the lance at one who was upon it), bent that weapon with hand. When<br>the fierce-armed and puissant Mahadeva of immeasurable energy had thus<br>bent his lance (into the form of a bow), that weapon came to be called<br>from that time by the name of Pinaka.[1493] The lord of Uma, beholding<br>Bhargava thus brought upon the palm of his hand, opened his mouth. The<br>chief of the gods then threw Bhargava into his mouth and swallowed him at<br>once. The puissant and high-souled Usanas of Bhrigu's race, entering the<br>stomach of Maheswara, began to wander there.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'How, O king, could Usanas succeed in wandering<br>within the stomach of that foremost of superior intelligence? What also<br>did that illustrious god do while the Brahmana was within his<br>stomach?'[1494]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In days of yore (having swallowed up Usanas), Mahadeva of<br>severe vows entered the waters and remained there like an immovable stake<br>of wood, O king, for millions of years (engaged in Yoga-meditation). His<br>Yoga penances of the austerest type having been over, he rose from the<br>mighty lake. Then that primeval god of the gods, viz., the eternal<br>Brahman, approached him, and enquired after the progress of his penances<br>and after his welfare. The deity having the bull for his emblem answered,<br>saying, 'My penances have been well-practised.' Of inconceivable soul,<br>possessed of great intelligence, and ever devoted to the religion of<br>truth, Sankara saw that Usanas within his stomach had become greater in<br>consequence of those penances of his.[1495] That foremost of Yogins<br>(viz., Usanas), rich with that wealth of penances and the wealth (he had<br>appropriated from Kuvera), shone brightly in the three worlds, endued<br>with great energy.[1496] After this, Mahadeva armed with Pinaka, that<br>soul of Yoga, once more betook himself to Yoga-meditation. Usanas,<br>however, filled with anxiety, began to wander within the stomach of the<br>great god. The great ascetic began to hymn the praises of the god from<br>where he was, desirous of finding an outlet for escape. Rudra, however,<br>having stopped all his outlets, prevented him from coming out. The great<br>ascetic Usanas, however, O chastiser of foes, from within Mahadeva's<br>stomach, repeatedly addressed the god, saying, 'Show me thy kindness!'<br>Unto him Mahadeva said, 'Go out through my urethra.' He had stopped up<br>all other outlets of his body. Confined on every side and unable to find<br>out the outlet indicated, the ascetic began to wander hither and thither,<br>burning all the while with Mahadeva's energy. At last he found the outlet<br>and issued through it. In consequence of this fact he came to be called<br>by the name of Sukra, and it is in consequence of that fact he also<br>became unable to attain (in course of his wandering) the central point of<br>the firmament. Beholding him come out of his stomach and shining brightly<br>with energy, Bhava, filled with anger, stood with lance uplifted in his<br>hand. The goddess Uma then interposed and forbade the angry lord of all<br>creatures, viz., her spouse, to slay the Brahmana. And in consequence of<br>Uma's having thus prevented her lord from accomplishing his purpose the<br>ascetic Usanas (from the day) became the son of the goddess.'<br><br>"The goddess said, 'This Brahmana no longer deserves to be slain by thee.<br>He has become my son. O god, one who comes out of thy stomach does not<br>deserve slaughter at thy hands.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Pacified by these words of his spouse, Bhava smiled<br>and said repeatedly these words, O king, 'Let this one go whithersoever<br>he likes.' Bowing unto the boon-giving Mahadeva and to also his spouse<br>the goddess Uma, the great ascetic Usanas, endued with superior<br>intelligence, proceeded to the place he chose. I have thus narrated to<br>thee, O chief of the Bharatas, the story of the high-souled Bhargava<br>about which thou didst ask me.'"
