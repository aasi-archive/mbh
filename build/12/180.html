                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Which of these, O grandsire, viz., kinsmen, or acts,<br>or wealth, or wisdom should be the refuge of a person? Questioned by me,<br>answer me this!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Wisdom is the refuge of creatures. Wisdom is regarded as<br>the highest of acquisitions. Wisdom is the highest felicity in the world.<br>Wisdom is heaven in the estimation of the good and virtuous. It was<br>through wisdom that Vali, Prahlada, Namuchi, and Manki, when they lost<br>their (earthly) prosperity, succeeded in acquiring felicity. What is<br>there that is superior to wisdom? In this connection is cited the old<br>story of the discourse between Indra and Kasyapa. Listen to it, O<br>Yudhishthira! Once on a time a prosperous Vaisya, in the enjoyment of<br>prosperity, and proud of his affluence, threw down, by negligently<br>driving his car, a Rishi's son of rigid vows named Kasyapa, devoted to<br>penances. Prostrated on the ground, the young man, in exceeding pain,<br>gave way to his wrath; and under the influence of despair resolved,<br>saying, 'I shall cast off my life. A poor man has no need of life in this<br>world.' While the Brahmana was lying in that state, silent and agitated,<br>deprived of energy and at the point of death, Indra appeared on the scene<br>in the form of a jackal and addressing him, said, 'All (inferior)<br>creatures covet birth in the human race. Among men again, the status of a<br>Brahmana is much desired. Thou, O Kasyapa, art a human being! Amongst<br>human beings, thou art again a Brahmana. Among Brahmanas, thou art again<br>one that is conversant with the Vedas. Having obtained that which is<br>attainable with very great difficulty, it behoveth thee not to give up<br>life from folly! All kinds Of (worldly) acquisitions are fraught with<br>pride. The declaration of the Srutis in that respect is perfectly true.<br>Thou lookest the picture of contentment. In forming such a resolve (which<br>is so derogatory of thy own self) about casting off thy life, thou actest<br>from cupidity! O, they are crowned with success that have hands! I<br>eagerly wish for the status of those creatures that have hands! We covet<br>hands as eagerly as you covet riches. There is no acquisition that is<br>more valuable than the acquisition of hands. Behold, O Brahmana, I cannot<br>extract this thorn that has entered my body, or crush these insects and<br>worms that are biting and afflicting me greatly! They that have bestowed<br>upon them two hands with ten fingers, succeed in throwing away or<br>crushing the worms (by scratching) that bite their limbs. They succeed in<br>constructing shelters for themselves from rain, cold, and heat. They<br>succeed also in enjoying excellent clothes for themselves, good food,<br>comfortable beds, and excellent habitations. Lying on this Earth, they<br>that have hands enjoy kine and other animals and cause them to carry<br>burthens or drag their vehicles, and by the aid of diverse means bring<br>those animals under sway (for their own purposes). Those living creatures<br>that are without tongues, that are helpless, of little strength, and<br>destitute of hands, bear all the several kinds of misery (indicated<br>above). By good luck, O ascetic, thou art not like them. By good luck,<br>thou art not a jackal, nor a worm, nor a mouse, nor a frog, nor an animal<br>of any other miserable order. With this measure of gain (that thou hast<br>won), thou shouldst, O Kasyapa, be contented! How happy, again, shouldst<br>thou feel at the thought that amongst living creatures thou art a<br>superior Brahmana! These worms are biting me! For want of hands I am<br>unable to drive them off. Behold this my miserable plight! I do not cast<br>off life because to do so is a very sinful act, and lest, indeed, I fall<br>into a more miserable order of existence! This order of existence, viz.,<br>that of a jackal, to which I now belong is rather tolerable. Miserable as<br>it is, there are many orders of existence below it that are more<br>miserable still. By birth certain classes of creatures become happier<br>than others who become subject to great woe. But I never see that there<br>is any order of being which can be said to be in the possession of<br>perfect happiness. Human beings, obtaining affluence, next wish for<br>sovereignty. Having achieved sovereignty their next wish is for the<br>status of gods. Having won that status they then wish for the chiefdom of<br>the celestials. If thou becomest affluent, thou wilt never succeed in<br>becoming a king (for thou art a Brahmana by birth), nor in becoming a god<br>(because, in reality, thy status of Brahmanahood is equal if not superior<br>to that of a god). If by any means (led away by the alluring prospect of<br>heavenly bliss) thou becomest a god (instead of attaining to a superior<br>position), thou wilt then covet for the chiefdom of the gods. In no<br>condition wilt thou be contented. Contentment does not result from<br>acquisition of desirable objects. Thirst is never slaked although there<br>is profusion of water.[539] The thirst for acquisition only blazes up<br>with each fresh acquisition like a fire with new faggots thrown into it.<br>In thee there is grief. But joy also dwells in thee. Both happiness and<br>misery dwell in thee. Why then shouldst thou yield to grief? One should<br>shut up, like birds in a cage, the very springs, viz., the understanding<br>and the senses of, all one's desires and acts. There can be no cutting of<br>a second head, nor of a third hand. That which does not exist can produce<br>no fear. One that is not acquainted with the enjoyment a certain object<br>affords, never feels a desire for that object. Desires arise from the<br>actual experience of the pleasures that touch or sight, or hearing gives.<br>Thou hast no idea of the taste of the wine called Varuni or of the meat<br>of the birds called Ladwaka. There is no drink and no food more delicious<br>than these. Thou hast no idea also, O Kasyapa, of every other superior<br>kind of drink and food that exists among men, for thou hast never tasted<br>it. Without doubt, therefore, not to taste, not to see, should be the vow<br>of a man if he is to win happiness. Creatures that have hands, without<br>doubt, become strong and earn wealth. Men are reduced by men to a state<br>of servitude, and are repeatedly afflicted (at the hands of their own<br>species) with death, imprisonment, and other tortures. Although such is<br>their condition, yet even they (without yielding to grief) laugh and<br>sport and indulge in merriment. Others again, though endued with might of<br>arms, and possessed of knowledge and great energy of mind, follow<br>censurable, sinful, and miserable professions. They seek to change such<br>professions for other pursuits (that are more dignified) but then they<br>are bound by their own acts (of a previous life) and by the force of<br>Destiny. The vilest man of the Pukkasa or the Chandala orders never<br>wishes to cast off his life. He is quite contented with the order of his<br>birth. Behold the illusion in this respect! Beholding those amongst thy<br>species that are destitute of arms, or struck with palsy, or afflicted<br>with other diseases, thou canst regard thyself as very happy and<br>possessed of valuable accompaniments amongst the members of thy own<br>order. If this thy regenerated body remains safe and sound, and free from<br>disease, and all thy limbs remain perfect, thou art sure of never<br>incurring any reproach amongst men. It would not behove thee, O Brahmana,<br>to cast off thy life even if any blame, founded on fact and capable of<br>bringing about thy dismissal from caste, attached to thee! Rise, and<br>practise virtue. It is not meet that thou shouldst throw away thy life!<br>If, O regenerate one, thou listen to me and place credence on my words,<br>thou wilt then obtain the highest reward of the religion inculcated in<br>the Vedas. Do thou set thyself to Vedic studies, and duly maintain thy<br>sacred fire, and observe truth, and self-restraint, and charity. Never<br>compare thyself boastfully with another. They who, by devoting themselves<br>to the study of the Vedas, become competent for performing sacrifices for<br>themselves and others, have no need to indulge in any kind of regret or<br>fear any kind of evil. They that are born under an auspicious<br>constellation on an auspicious lunation and at an auspicious hour, strive<br>their best for performing sacrifices, practising charity, and procreating<br>children, and desiring to pass their time cheerfully in those acts, at<br>last win very great happiness.[540] They, on the other hand, that are<br>born under evil constellations, inauspicious lunations, and at evil<br>hours, become destitute of sacrifices and progeny and at last fall into<br>the Asura order.[541] In my former life I had much useless learning. I<br>always sought for reasons and had very little faith. I was a slanderer of<br>the Vedas. I was destitute of the (fourfold) objects of life, and was<br>devoted to that science of argumentation which is based upon ocular or<br>tangible proofs.[542] I used to utter words based on (plausible) reasons.<br>Indeed, in assemblies, I always spoke of reasons (and never faith). I<br>used to speak irreverently of the declarations of the Srutis and address<br>Brahmanas in domineering tones. I was an unbeliever, skeptical of<br>everything, and though really ignorant, proud of my learning. This status<br>of a jackal that I have obtained in this life is the consequence, O<br>regenerate one, of those sins of mine! If even after hundreds of days and<br>nights I that am a jackal can once again obtain the status of humanity, I<br>shall then pass my life in contentment, heedful of the true objects of<br>existence, and engaged in sacrifices and gifts. I shall then know what<br>should be known, and avoid what should be avoided!' Thus addressed, the<br>ascetic Kasyapa, rising up, said, 'O, thou art certainly possessed of<br>knowledge and great intelligence! I am really surprised at all this!'<br>With eyes whose vision was extended by knowledge, the Brahmana then<br>beheld that being who had addressed him to be Indra, chief of the gods<br>and the lord of Sachi. Kasyapa then worshipped that god having the best<br>of steeds for the animal that bore him. Receiving afterwards the god's<br>permission, the Brahmana returned to his abode.'"
