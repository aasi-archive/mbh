                            "Yudhishthira said, 'All persons on earth, O foremost of men, applaud<br>virtuous behaviour. I have, however, great doubts with respect to this<br>object of their praise. If the topic be capable of being understood by<br>us, O foremost of virtuous men, I desire to hear everything about the way<br>in which virtuous behaviour can be acquired. How indeed, is that<br>behaviour acquired, O Bharata! I desire to hear it. Tell me also, O<br>foremost of speakers, what has been said to be the characteristics of<br>that behaviour.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, Formerly, O giver of honours, Duryodhana while burning<br>with grief at sight of that well-known prosperity belonging to thee and<br>thy brothers at Indraprastha and for the jeers he received in consequence<br>of his mistakes at the grand mansion, had asked his father Dhritarashtra<br>the same question. Listen to what transpired on that occasion, O Bharata!<br>Having seen that grand mansion of thine and that high prosperity of which<br>thou wert master, Duryodhana, while sitting before his father, spake of<br>what he had seen to the latter. Having heard the words of Duryodhana,<br>Dhritarashtra, addressing his son and Karna, replied unto him as follows.<br><br>Dhritarashtra said, 'Why dost thou grieve, O son! I desire to hear the<br>cause in detail. If after ascertaining the reason they appear to be<br>adequate, I shall then endeavour to instruct thee. O subjugator of<br>hostile towns, thou too hast obtained great affluence. All thy brothers<br>are ever obedient to thee, as also all thy friends and relatives. Thou<br>coverest thy limbs with the best robes. Thou eatest the richest<br>food.[378] Steeds of the best kind bear thee. Why then hast thou become<br>pale and emaciated?'<br><br>Duryodhana said, 'Ten thousands of high-souled Snataka Brahmanas daily<br>eat at Yudhishthira's palace off plates of gold. Beholding his excellent<br>mansion adorned with excellent flowers and fruit, his steeds of the<br>Tittiri and the Kalmasha breeds, his robes of diverse kinds, indeed,<br>beholding that high prosperity of my enemies viz., the sons of Pandu, a<br>prosperity that resembles the high affluence of Vaisravana himself, I am<br>burning with grief, O Bharata!'<br><br>Dhritarashtra said, 'If thou wishest, O sire, to win prosperity like that<br>of Yudhishthira or that which is even superior to it, do thou then, O<br>son, endeavour to be of virtuous behaviour. Without doubt, one may, by<br>behaviour alone, conquer the three worlds. There is nothing impossible of<br>attainment by persons of virtuous behaviour. Mandhatri conquered the<br>whole world in course of only one night, Janamejaya, in course of three;<br>and Nabhaga, in course of seven. All these kings were possessed of<br>compassion and of virtuous behaviour. For this reason the earth came to<br>them of their own accord, won over by their virtue.<br><br>"Duryodhana said, 'I desire to hear, O Bharata, how that behaviour may be<br>acquired, that behaviour, viz., in consequence of which the earth was won<br>so speedily (by the kings named by thee).<br><br>"'Dhritarashtra said, 'In this connection, the following old narrative is<br>cited. It was formerly recited by Narada on the subject of virtuous<br>behaviour. In days of yore, the Daitya Prahlada, by the merit of his<br>behaviour, snatched from the high-souled Indra his sovereignty and<br>reduced the three worlds to subjection. Sukra then, with joined hands,<br>approached Vrihaspati. Possessed of great wisdom, the chief of the<br>celestials addressed the great preceptor, saying, 'I desire thee to tell<br>me what is the source of felicity. Thus addressed, Vrihaspati said unto<br>him that Knowledge (leading to emancipation) is the source of the highest<br>felicity. Indeed, Vrihaspati indicated Knowledge to be the source of<br>supreme felicity. Indra, however, once more asked him as to whether there<br>was anything higher than that.<br><br>"Vrihaspati said, 'There is something, O son, that is still higher. The<br>high-souled Bhargava (Usanas) will instruct thee better. Repair to him,<br>blessed be thou, and enquire of him, O chief of the celestials!'<br>Possessed of great ascetic merit and endued with great splendour, the<br>chief of the celestials then repaired to Bhargava and obtained from him<br>with a ratified heart, a knowledge of what was for his great good.<br>Obtaining the permission of the high-souled Bhargava, the performer of a<br>hundred sacrifices once more asked the sage as to whether there was<br>anything higher (as the means for the acquisition of felicity) than what<br>the sage had already told him. The omniscient Bhargava said, 'The<br>high-souled Prahlada has better knowledge.' Learning this, Indra became<br>highly delighted. The chastiser of Paka, possessed of great intelligence,<br>assumed the form of a Brahmana, and repairing to Prahlada, asked him,<br>saying, 'I desire to hear what conduces to felicity. Prahlada answered<br>the Brahmana, saying, 'O chief of regenerate ones, I have no time, being<br>wholly occupied in the task of ruling the three worlds, I cannot,<br>therefore, instruct thee.' The Brahmana said, 'O king, when thou mayst<br>have leisure, I desire to listen to thy instructions about what course of<br>conduct is productive of good. At this answer, king Prahlada. became<br>delighted with that utterer of Brahma. Saying, 'So be it!' he availed of<br>a favourable opportunity for imparting to the Brahmana the truths of<br>knowledge. The Brahma na duly observed towards Prahlada the conduct which<br>a disciple should observe towards his preceptor, and began with his whole<br>heart to do what Prahlada desired. Many a time the Brahmana enquired,<br>saying, 'O chastiser of foes, by what means hast thou been able to win<br>the sovereignty of the three worlds? Tell me, O righteous king, 'What<br>those means are.' Prahlada, O monarch, answered the question the Brahmana<br>asked.<br><br>"Prahlada said, 'I do not, O regenerate one, feel any pride in<br>consequence of my being a king, nor do I cherish any hostile feelings<br>towards the Brahmanas. On the other hand, I accept and follow the<br>counsels of policy they declare unto Me based upon the teachings of<br>Sukra. In complete trustfulness they say unto me what they wish to say,<br>and restrain me from courses that are unrighteous or improper. I am ever<br>obedient to the teachings of Sukra. I wait upon and serve the Brahmanas<br>and my seniors. I bear no malice. I am of righteous soul. I have<br>conquered wrath. I am self-restrained, and all my senses are under my<br>control. These regenerate ones that are my instructors pour beneficial<br>instructions upon me like bees dropping honey into the cells of their<br>comb. I taste the nectar dropped by those learned men, and like the Moon<br>among the constellations I live among the members of my race.[379] Even<br>this is nectar on earth, even this is the clearest eye, viz., listening<br>to the teaching of Sukra from the lips of Brahmanas and acting according<br>to them. In these consists the good of a man.' Thus said Prahlada unto<br>that utterer of Brahma. Served dutifully by him, the chief of the Daityas<br>once more said, 'O foremost of regenerate ones, I am exceedingly<br>gratified with thee in consequence of thy dutiful behaviour towards me.<br>Ask of me the boon thou desirest, blessed be thou, for verily I shall<br>grant thee what thou wilt ask. The Brahmana answered the chief of the<br>Daityas saying, 'Very well. I will obey thee.' Prahlada, gratified with<br>him, said, 'Take what thou wishest.'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'If, the king, thou hast been gratified with me and<br>if thou wishest to do what is agreeable to me, I desire then to acquire<br>thy behaviour. Even this is the boon that I solicit.[380] At this, though<br>delighted, Prahlada became filled with a great fear. Indeed, when this<br>boon was indicated by the Brahmana, the Daitya chief thought the<br>solicitor could not be a person of ordinary energy. Wondering much,<br>Prahlada at last said, 'Let it be so.' Having, however, granted the boon,<br>the Daitya chief became filled with grief. The Brahmana, having received<br>the boon, went away, but Prahlada, O king, became penetrated by a deep<br>anxiety and knew not what to do. While the Daitya chief sat brooding over<br>the matter, a flame of light issued out of his body. It had a shadowy<br>form of great splendour and huge proportions. Prahlada asked the form,<br>saying, 'Who art thou?' The form answered, saying, 'I am the embodiment<br>of thy Behaviour. Cast off by thee I am going away. I shall henceforth, O<br>king, dwell in that faultless and foremost of Brahmanas who had become<br>thy devoted disciple.' Having said these words, the form disappeared and<br>soon after entered the body of Sakra. After the disappearance of that<br>form, another of similar shape issued out of Prahlada's body. The Daitya<br>chief addressed it, saying, 'Who art thou?' The form answered, saying,<br>'Know me, O Prahlada, for the embodiment of Righteousness. I shall go<br>there where that foremost of Brahmanas is, for, O chief of the Daityas, I<br>reside there where Behaviour dwells.' Upon the disappearance of<br>Righteousness, a third form, O monarch, blazing with splendour, issued<br>out of the body of the high souled Prahlada. Asked by Prahlada as to who<br>he was, that form possessed of great effulgence answered, saying, 'Know,<br>O chief of the Daityas, that I am Truth. I shall leave thee, following<br>the way of Righteousness.' After Truth had left Prahlada, following in<br>the wake of Righteousness, another great person issued out of Prahlada's<br>body. Asked by the Daityas king, the mighty being answered, 'I am the<br>embodiment of Good deeds. Know, O Prahlada, that 1 live there where Truth<br>lives.' After this one had left Prahlada, another being came out,<br>uttering loud and deep cries. Addressed by Prahlada, he answered, 'Know<br>that I am Might. I dwell there where Good deeds are.' 'Having said these<br>words, Might went away to that place whither Good deeds had gone. After<br>this, a goddess of great effulgence issued out of Prahlada's body. The<br>Daitya chief asked her and she answered him saying that she was the<br>embodiment of Prosperity, adding, 'I dwelt in thee, O hero, O thou of<br>prowess incapable of being baffled! Cast off by thee, I shall follow in<br>the wake of Might.' The high-souled Prahlada, penetrated, with great<br>fear, once more asked the goddess, saying, 'Where dost thou go, O<br>goddess, O thou that dwellest amid lotuses? Thou art ever devoted to<br>truth, O goddess, and thou art the first of deities. Who is that foremost<br>of Brahmanas (who was my disciple)? I desire to know the truth.'<br><br>The goddess of Prosperity said, 'Devoted to the vow of Brahmacharya, that<br>Brahmana who was instructed by thee was Sukra. O puissant one, he robbed<br>thee of that sovereignty which thou hadst over the three worlds. O<br>righteous one, it was by thy behaviour that thou hadst reduced the three<br>worlds to subjection. Knowing this, the chief of the celestials robbed<br>thee of thy behaviour. Righteousness and Truth and Good deeds and Might<br>and myself, O thou of great wisdom, all have our root verily in<br>Behaviour.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Having said these words, the goddess of Prosperity<br>went away, as also all the rest, O Yudhishthira! Duryodhana, once more<br>addressing his father, said these words: 'O delighter of the Kurus, I<br>wish to know the truth about Behaviour. Tell me the means by which it may<br>be acquired.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Those means were indicated by the high-souled<br>Prahlada while discoursing unto Indra. Listen, however, O ruler of men,<br>as how in brief Behaviour may be acquired. Abstention from injury, by<br>act, thought, and word, in respect of all creatures, compassion, and<br>gift, constitute behaviour that is worthy of praise. That act or exertion<br>by which others are not benefited, or that act in consequence of which<br>one has to feel shame, should never be done. That act, on the other hand,<br>should be done in consequence of which o tie may win praise in society. O<br>best of the Kurus, I have now told thee in brief as to what Behaviour is.<br>If O king, persons of wicked behaviour do ever win prosperity, they do<br>not enjoy it long, O son, and are seen to be exterminated by the root.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra continued, 'Knowing all this truly, do thou, O son, be of<br>good behaviour, if thou desirest to obtain prosperity greater than that<br>of Yudhishthira.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Even this was what king Dhritarashtra said unto his<br>son. Do thou act according, to these instructions, O son of Kunti, and<br>thou wilt then surely obtain their fruit.'"
