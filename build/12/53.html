                            "Vaisampayana said, 'The slayer of Madhu, retiring to his bed, slept<br>happily. Awaking when half a Yama was wanting to usher in the day, he<br>addressed himself to contemplation. Fixing all his senses, he meditated<br>on the eternal Brahma. Then a batch of well-trained and sweet-voiced<br>persons, conversant with hymns and the Puranas, began to utter the<br>praises of Vasudeva, that lord of all creatures and creator of the<br>universe. Others, marking time by clapping of hands, began to recite<br>sweet hymns, and vocalists began to sing. Conch-shells and drums were<br>blown and beaten by thousands. The delightful sound of Vinas, Panavas,<br>and bamboo flutes was heard. The spacious mansion of Krishna, in<br>consequence thereof, seemed to laugh with music. In the palace of king<br>Yudhishthira also sweet voices were heard, uttering auspicious wishes,<br>and the sound of songs too and musical instruments. Then he of Dasarha's<br>race performed his ablutions. Joining his hands, the mighty-armed hero of<br>unfading glory silently recited his secret mantras, and kindling a fire<br>poured libations of clarified butter upon it. Giving away a thousand kine<br>unto a thousand Brahmanas all of whom were fully conversant with the four<br>Vedas, he caused them to utter benedictions upon him. Touching next<br>diverse kinds of auspicious articles and beholding himself in a clear<br>mirror, Krishna addressed Satyaki, saying, 'Go, O descendant of Sini, and<br>repairing to Yudhishthira's abode, ascertain whether that king of great<br>energy is dressed for visiting Bhishma.' At these words of Krishna,<br>Satyaki, proceeding quickly to the royal son of Pandu, said unto him,<br>'The foremost of cars, belonging to Vasudeva of great intelligence,<br>stands ready, O king, for Janardana will go to see Ganga's son. O<br>righteous king of great splendour, he is waiting for thee. It behoveth<br>thee now to do what should be done next.' Thus addressed, Dharma's son<br>Yudhishthira answered as follows.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O Phalguna of unrivalled splendour, let my foremost<br>of cars be made ready. We should not be accompanied (today) by the<br>soldiers, but we shall proceed ourselves. That foremost of righteous<br>persons, Bhishma, should not be vexed. Let the guards, therefore, O<br>Dhananjaya, stop today. From this day Ganga's son will speak of things<br>that are great mysteries. I do not therefore, O son of Kunti, wish that<br>there should be a miscellaneous gathering (in Bhishma's presence).'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of the king, Kunti's son<br>Dhananjaya, that foremost of men (went out and coming back) represented<br>unto him that his best of cars stood harnessed for him. King<br>Yudhishthira, and the twins, and Bhima and Arjuna, the five resembling<br>the five elements, then proceeded towards Krishna's abode. While the<br>high-souled Pandavas were coming, Krishna of great intelligence,<br>accompanied by the grandson of Sini, mounted on his car. Saluting one<br>another from their cars and each enquiring of the other whether the night<br>had been passed happily by him, those bulls among men proceeded, without<br>stopping on those foremost of cars whose rattle resembled the roar of the<br>clouds. Krishna's steeds, viz., Valahaka and Meghapushpa and Saivya and<br>Sugriva were urged by Daruka. The animals, urged by him, O king,<br>proceeded, indenting the earth with their hoofs. Endued with great<br>strength and great speed, they flew onwards, devouring the very skies.<br>Traversing the sacred field of Kuru, the princes proceeded to that spot<br>where the puissant Bhishma on his bed of arrows was lying, surrounded by<br>those great Rishis, like Brahman himself in the midst of the gods. Then<br>Govinda and Yudhishthira and Bhima and the wielder of Gandiva and the<br>twins and Satyaki, alighting from their vehicles, saluted the Rishis by<br>raising their right hands. Surrounded by them, king Yudhishthira like the<br>moon in the midst of the stars approached Ganga's son like Vasava<br>proceeding towards Brahman. Overcome with fear, the king timidly cast his<br>eyes on the mighty-armed hero lying on his bed of arrows like the Sun<br>himself dropped from the firmament.'"
