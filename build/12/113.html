                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me O bull of Bharata's race, how a king,<br>without the usual aids, having obtained a kingdom that is so precious a<br>possession, behave himself towards a powerful foe.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, In this connection is cited the old story of the discourse<br>between the Ocean and the Rivers. In days of old, eternal Ocean, that<br>lord of Rivers, that refuge of the foes of the celestials, asked all the<br>Rivers for resolving this doubt that had arisen in his mind.'<br><br>"The Ocean said, 'Ye Rivers, I see that all of you, with your full<br>currents, bring away trees of large trunks, tearing them off with their<br>roots and branches. Ye do not, however, ever bring to me a cane. The<br>canes that grow on your banks are of mean stems and destitute of<br>strength. Do you refuse to wash them down through contempt, or are they<br>of any use to you? I desire, therefore, to hear what the motive is that<br>inspires all of you. Indeed, why is it that canes are not washed down by<br>any of you, uprooted from the banks where they grow?' Thus addressed, the<br>River Ganga, replied unto Ocean, that lord of all Rivers, in these words<br>of grave import, fraught with reason, and, therefore, acceptable to all.'<br><br>"Ganga said, 'Trees stand in one and the same place and are unyielding in<br>respect of the spot where they stand. In consequence of this disposition<br>of theirs to resist our currents, they are obliged to leave the place of<br>their growth. Canes, however, act differently. The cane, beholding the<br>advancing current, bends to it. The others do not act in that way. After<br>the current has passed away, the cane resumes its former posture. The<br>cane knows the virtues of Time and opportunity. It is docile and<br>obedient. It is yielding, without being stiff. For these reasons, it<br>stands where it grows, without having to come with us. Those plants,<br>trees, and creepers that bend and rise before the force of wind and<br>water, have never to suffer discomfiture (by being taken up by the<br>roots).'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'That person who does not yield to the power of a foe<br>that has advanced in might and that is competent to imprison or kill,<br>soon meets with destruction.[345] That man of wisdom who acts after<br>ascertaining fully the strength and weakness, the might and energy, of<br>himself and his foe, has never to suffer discomfiture. An intelligent<br>man, therefore, when he sees his enemy to be more powerful than himself,<br>should adopt the behaviour of the cane. That is an indication of wisdom.'"
