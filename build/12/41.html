                            "Vaisampayana said, 'The royal son of Kunti, freed from grief and the<br>fever of his heart, took his seat, with face eastwards, on excellent seat<br>made of gold. On another seat, beautiful and blazing and made of gold,<br>sat with face directed towards him, those two chastisers of foes, viz.,<br>Satyaki and Vasudeva. Placing the king in their midst, on his two sides<br>sat Bhima and Arjuna upon two beautiful seats adorned with gems. Upon a<br>white throne of ivory, decked with gold, sat Pritha with Sahadeva and<br>Nakula. Sudharman,[123] and Vidura, and Dhaumya, and the Kuru king<br>Dhritarashtra, each sat separately on separate seats that blazed with the<br>effulgence of fire. Yuyutsu and Sanjaya and Gandhari of great fame, all<br>sat down where king Dhritarashtra had taken his seat. The<br>righteous-souled king, seated there, touched the beautiful white flowers,<br>Swastikas, vessels full of diverse articles, earth, gold, silver, and<br>gems, (that were placed before him). Then all the subjects, headed by the<br>priest, came to see king Yudhishthira, bringing with them diverse kinds<br>of auspicious articles. Then earth, and gold, and many kinds of gems, and<br>all the things in profusion that were necessary for the performance of<br>the coronation rite, were brought there. There were golden jars full to<br>the brim (with water), and those made of copper and silver and earth, and<br>flowers, and fried paddy, and Kusa grass, and cow's milk, and<br>(sacrificial) fuel consisting of the wood of Sami, Pippala, and Palasa,<br>and honey and clarified butter and (sacrificial) ladles made of Udumvara,<br>and conches adorned with gold.[124] Then the priest Dhaumya, at the<br>request of Krishna, constructed, according to rule, an altar gradually<br>inclining towards the cast and the north. Causing the high-souled<br>Yudhishthira then, with Krishna the daughter of Drupada, to be seated<br>upon a handsome seat, called Sarvatobhadra, with firm feet and covered<br>with tiger-skin and blazing with effulgence, began to pour libations of<br>clarified butter (upon the sacrificial fire) with proper mantras. Then he<br>of Dasaratha's race, rising from his seat, took up the sanctified conch,<br>poured the water it contained upon the head of that lord of earth, viz.,<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti. The royal sage Dhritarashtra and all the<br>subjects also did the same at the request of Krishna. The son of Pandu<br>then, with his brothers, thus bathed with the sanctified water of the<br>conch, looked exceedingly beautiful. Then Panavas and Anakas and drums<br>were beaten. King Yudhishthira the just duly accepted the gifts made unto<br>him by the subjects. Always giving away presents in profusion in all his<br>sacrifices, the king honoured his subjects in return. He gave a thousand<br>nishkas unto the Brahmanas that uttered (especial) benedictions on him.<br>All of them had studied the Vedas and were endued with wisdom and good<br>behaviour. Gratified (with gifts), the Brahmanas, O king, wished him<br>prosperity and victory, and with voice melodious like that of swans,<br>uttered his praises, saying, 'O Yudhishthira of mighty arms, by good<br>luck, O son of Pandu, victory has been thine. By good luck, O thou of<br>great splendour, thou hast recovered thy position through prowess. By<br>good luck, the wielder of Gandiva, and Bhimasena, and thyself, O king,<br>and the two sons of Madri, are all well, having slain your foes and<br>escaped with life from the battle, so destructive of heroes. Do thou, O<br>Bharata, attend without delay to those acts that should next be done.'<br>Thus adored by those pious men, king Yudhishthira the just, with his<br>friends, became installed on the throne of a large kingdom, O Bharata!'"
