                            "Yudhishthira said, 'How, O Bharata, should a person act who desires to<br>adhere to virtue? O bull of Bharata's race, possessed as thou art of<br>learning, tell me this, questioned by me. Truth and falsehood exist,<br>covering all the worlds. Which of these two, O king, should a person<br>adopt that is firm in virtue? What again is truth? What is falsehood?<br>What, again, is eternal virtue? On what occasions should a person tell<br>the truth, and on what occasions should he tell an untruth?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'To tell the truth is consistent with righteousness. There<br>is nothing higher than truth. I shall now, O Bharata, say unto thee that<br>which is not generally known to men. There where falsehood would assume<br>the aspect of truth, truth should not be said. There, again, where truth<br>would assume the aspect of falsehood, even falsehood should be said. That<br>ignorant person incurs sin who says truth which is dissociated from<br>righteousness. That person is said to be conversant with duties who can<br>distinguish truth from falsehood.[334] Even a person that is<br>disrespectable, that is of uncleansed soul, and that is very cruel, may<br>succeed in earning great merit as the hunter Valaka by slaying the blind<br>beast (that threatened to destroy all creatures).[335] How extraordinary<br>it is that a person of foolish understanding, though desirous of<br>acquiring merit (by austere penances) still committed a sinful act![336]<br>An owl again, on the banks of the Ganges, (by doing an unrighteous deed)<br>obtained great merit.[337] The question thou hast asked me is a difficult<br>one, since it is difficult to say what righteousness is. It is not easy<br>to indicate it. No one in discoursing upon righteousness, can indicate it<br>accurately. Righteousness was declared (by Brahman) for the advancement<br>and growth of all creatures. Therefore, that which leads to advancement<br>and growth is righteousness. Righteousness was declared for restraining<br>creatures from injuring one another. Therefore, that is Righteousness<br>which prevents injury to creatures. Righteousness (Dharma) is so called<br>because it upholds all creatures. In fact, all creatures are upheld by<br>righteousness. Therefore, that is righteousness which is capable of<br>upholding all creatures. Some say that righteousness consists in what has<br>been inculcated in the Srutis. Others do not agree to this. I would not<br>censure them that say so. Everything, again, has not been laid down in<br>the Srutis.[338] Sometimes men (robbers), desirous of obtaining the<br>wealth of some one, make enquiries (for facilitating the act of plunder).<br>One should never answer such enquiries. That is a settled duty. If by<br>maintaining silence, one succeeds in escaping, one should remain silent.<br>If, on the other hand, one's silence at a time when one must speak rouses<br>suspicion, it would be better on such an occasion to say what is untrue<br>than what is true. This is a settled conclusion. If one can escape from<br>sinful men by even a (false) oath, one may take it without incurring sin.<br>One should not, even if one be able, giveaway his wealth to sinful men.<br>Wealth given to sinful men afflicts even the giver. If a creditor desires<br>to make his debtor pay off the loan by rendering bodily service, the<br>witnesses would all be liars, if, summoned by the creditor for<br>establishing the truth of the contract, they did not say what should be<br>said. When life is at risk, or on occasion of marriage, one may say an<br>untruth. One that seeks for virtue, does not commit a sin by saying an<br>untruth, if that untruth be said to save the wealth and prosperity of<br>others or for the religious purposes. Having promised to pay, one becomes<br>bound to fulfil his promise. Upon failure, let the self-appropriator be<br>forcibly enslaved. If a person without fulfilling a righteous engagement<br>acts with impropriety, he should certainly be afflicted with the rod of<br>chastisement for having adopted such behaviour.[339] A deceitful person,<br>falling away from all duties and abandoning those of his own order,<br>always wishes to betake himself to the practices of Asuras for supporting<br>life. Such a sinful wretch living by deceit should be slain by every<br>means. Such sinful men think that there is nothing in this world higher<br>than wealth. Such men should never be tolerated. No one should eat with<br>them. They should be regarded to have fallen down in consequence of their<br>sins. Indeed, fallen away from the condition of humanity and shut out<br>from the grace of the gods, they are even like evil genii. Without<br>sacrifices and without penances as they are, forbear from their<br>companionship. If their wealth be lost, they commit even suicide which is<br>exceedingly pitiable. Among those sinful men there is no one to whom thou<br>canst say, 'This is thy duty. Let thy heart turn to it.' Their settled<br>convictions are that there is nothing in this world that is equal to<br>wealth. The person that would slay such a creature would incur no sin. He<br>who kills him kills one that has been already killed by his own acts. If<br>slain, it is the dead that is slain. He who vows to destroy those persons<br>of lost senses should keep his vows.[340] Such sinners are, like the crow<br>and the vulture, dependent on deceit for their living. After the<br>dissolution of their (human) bodies, they take rebirth as crows and<br>vultures. One should, in any matter, behave towards another as that other<br>behaves in that matter. He who practises deceit should be resisted with<br>deceit while one that is honest should be treated with honesty.'"
