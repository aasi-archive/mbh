                            Vaisampayana said, "After this, Arjuna once more addressed his eldest<br>brother of unfading glory, viz., king Yudhishthira of cheerless heart,<br>and said these words: 'O thou that art conversant with every kind of<br>duty, having by the practice of Kshatriya duties obtained sovereignty<br>that is so very difficult of acquisition, and having conquered all thy<br>foes, why dost thou burn in grief? O king, as regards Kshatriyas, death<br>in battle is regarded more meritorious for them than the performance of<br>diverse sacrifices. It is so declared in the ordinance that lays down the<br>duties of Kshatriyas. Penances and Renunciation are the duties of<br>Brahmanas. Even this is the ordinance (affecting the two orders) about<br>the next world. Indeed, O puissant one, death in battle is laid down for<br>Kshatriyas. The duties of Kshatriyas are exceedingly fierce and are<br>always connected with the use of weapons, and it has been laid down, O<br>chief of the Bharatas, that they should, when the time comes, perish by<br>weapons on the field of battle. The life of even a Brahmana, O king, that<br>lives in the observance of Kshatriya duties, is not censurable, for<br>Kshatriyas also have sprung from Brahmana. Neither Renunciation, nor<br>Sacrifice, nor Penances, nor dependence on the wealth of others, O ruler<br>of men, has been ordained for Kshatriyas. Thou art acquainted with all<br>duties, and thou art of righteous soul, O bull of Bharata's race! Thou<br>art a wise king, skilled in all acts. Thou canst distinguish what is<br>right in this world from what is wrong. Casting off this cheerlessness by<br>repentance, address thyself with a strong will to action. The heart of a<br>Kshatriya especially is hard as thunder. Having by the exercise of<br>Kshatriya duties vanquished thy foes and acquired empire without a thorn<br>in its side, conquer thy soul, O ruler of men, and be engaged in the<br>performance of sacrifices and the practice of charity. Indra himself,<br>though a Brahmana, became a Kshatriya in his acts, and battled with his<br>sinful kinsfolk for eight hundred and ten times. Those acts of his, O<br>monarch, are adorable and worthy of praise. Through them he obtained, as<br>we have heard, the chiefship of the gods. Do thou, therefore, O monarch,<br>perform sacrifices with profuse presents even as Indra did, O ruler of<br>men, and thereby free thyself from thy fever. Do not, O bull among<br>Kshatriyas, grieve thus for what is past. They that have been slain have<br>attained to the highest end, sanctified by weapons and agreeably to the<br>ordinances of the Kshatriya religion. That which has happened was<br>ordained to happen. Destiny, O tiger among kings, is incapable of being<br>resisted.'"
