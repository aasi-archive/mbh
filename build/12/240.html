                            "Vyasa said, 'O excellent son, asked by thee, I have told thee truly what<br>the answer to thy question should be according to the doctrine of<br>knowledge as expounded in the Sankhya system. Listen now to me as I<br>expound to thee all that should be done (for the same end) according to<br>the Yoga doctrine. The uniting together of Intellect and Mind, and all<br>the Senses, and the all-pervading Soul is said to be Knowledge of the<br>foremost kind. That Knowledge should be acquired (through the preceptor's<br>aid) by one that is of a tranquil disposition, that has mastered his<br>senses, that is capable (by meditation) of turning his gaze on the Soul,<br>that takes a pleasure in (such) meditation, that is endued with<br>intelligence and pure in acts. One should seek to acquire this Knowledge<br>by abandoning those five impediments of Yoga which are known to the wise,<br>viz., desire, wrath, cupidity, fear, and sleep. Wrath is conquered by<br>tranquillity of disposition. Desire is conquered by giving up all<br>purposes. By reflecting with the aid of the understanding upon topics<br>worthy of reflection,[967] one endued with patience succeeds in<br>abandoning sleep. By steady endurance one should restrain one's organs of<br>generation and the stomach (from unworthy or sinful indulgence). One<br>should protect one's hands and feet by (using) one's eyes. One should<br>protect one's eyes and ears by the aid of one's mind, one's mind and<br>speech by one's acts. One should avoid fear by heedfulness, and pride by<br>waiting upon the wise. Subduing procrastination, one should, by these<br>means, subdue these impediments of Yoga. One should pay one's adorations<br>to fire and the Brahmanas, and one should bow one's head to the deities.<br>One should avoid all kinds of inauspicious discourse, and speech that is<br>fraught with malice, and words that are painful to other minds. Brahma is<br>the effulgent seed (of everything). It is, again, the essence of that<br>seed whence is all this.[968] Brahma became the eye, in the form of this<br>mobile and immobile universe, of all entities that took birth.[969]<br>Meditation, study, gift, truth, modesty, simplicity, forgiveness, purity<br>of body, purity of conduct, subjugation of the senses, these enhance<br>one's energy, which (when enhanced) destroys one's sins. By behaving<br>equally towards all creatures and by living in contentment upon what is<br>acquired easily and without effort, one attains to the fruition of all<br>one's objects and succeeds in obtaining knowledge. Cleansed of all sins,<br>endued with energy, abstemious in diet, with senses under complete<br>control, one should, after having subdued both desire and wrath, seek to<br>attain to Brahma,[970] Firmly uniting the senses and the mind (having<br>drawn them away from all external objects) with gaze fixed inwards, one<br>should, in the still hours of evening or in those before dawn, place<br>one's mind upon the knowledge. If even one of the five senses of a human<br>being be kept unrestrained, all his wisdom may be seen to escape through<br>it like water through an unstopped hole at the bottom of a leathern bag.<br>The mind in the first instance should be sought to be restrained by the<br>Yogin after the manner of a fisherman seeking at the outset to render<br>that one among the fish powerless from which there is the greatest danger<br>to his nets. Having first subdued the mind, the Yogin should then proceed<br>to subdue his ears, then his eyes, then his tongue, and then his nose.<br>Having restrained these, he should fix them on the mind. Then withdrawing<br>the mind from all purposes, he should fix it on the knowledge. Indeed,<br>having restrained the five senses, the Yati should fix them on the mind.<br>When these the mind for their sixth become concentrated in the knowledge,<br>and thus concentrated remain steady and untroubled, then Brahma becomes<br>perceptible like a smokeless fire of blazing flames or the Sun of<br>effulgent radiance. Indeed, one then beholds in oneself one's soul like<br>lightning fire in the skies. Everything then appears in it and it appears<br>in everything in consequence of its infinitude. Those high-souled<br>Brahmanas that are possessed of wisdom, that are endued with fortitude,<br>that are possessed of high knowledge, and that are engaged in the good of<br>all creatures, succeed in beholding it. Engaged in the observance of<br>austere vows, the Yogin who conducts himself thus for six months, seated<br>by himself on an isolated spot, succeeds in attaining to an equality with<br>the Indestructible.[971] Annihilation, extension, power to present varied<br>aspects in the same person or body, celestial scents, and sounds, and<br>sights, the most agreeable sensations of taste and touch, pleasurable<br>sensations of coolness and warmth, equality with the wind, capability of<br>understanding (by inward light) the meaning of scriptures and every work<br>of genius, companionship of celestial damsels,&#8212;acquiring all these by<br>Yoga the Yogin should disregard them and merge them all in the<br>knowledge.[972] Restraining speech and the senses one should practise<br>Yoga during the hours after dusk, the hours before dawn, and at dawn of<br>day, seated on a mountain summit, or at the foot of a goodly tree, or<br>with a tree before him.[973] Restraining all the senses within the heart,<br>one should, with faculties concentrated, think on the Eternal and<br>Indestructible like a man of the world thinking of wealth and other<br>valuable possessions. One should never, while practising Yoga, withdraw<br>one's mind from it. One should with devotion betake oneself to those<br>means by which one may succeed in restraining the mind that is very<br>restless. One should never permit oneself to fall away from it. With the<br>senses and the mind withdrawn from everything else, the Yogin (for<br>practice) should betake himself to empty caves of mountains, to temples<br>consecrated to the deities, and to empty houses or apartments, for living<br>there. One should not associate with another in either speech, act, or<br>thought. Disregarding all things, and eating very abstemiously, the Yogin<br>should look with an equal eye upon objects acquired or lost. He should<br>behave after the same manner towards one that praises and one that<br>censures him. He should not seek the good or the evil of one or the<br>other. He should not rejoice at an acquisition or suffer anxiety when he<br>meets with failure or loss. Of uniform behaviour towards all beings, he<br>should imitate the wind.[974] Unto one whose mind is thus turned to<br>itself, who leads a life of purity, and who casts an equal eye upon all<br>things,&#8212;indeed, unto one who is ever engaged in Yoga thus for even six<br>months,&#8212;Brahma as represented by sound appears very vividly.[975]<br>Beholding all men afflicted with anxiety (on account of earning wealth<br>and comfort), the Yogin should view a clod of earth, a piece of stone,<br>and a lump of gold with an equal eye. Indeed, he should withdraw himself<br>from this path (of earning wealth), cherishing an aversion for it, and<br>never suffer himself to be stupefied. Even if a person happens to belong<br>to the inferior order, even if one happens to be a woman, both of them,<br>by following in the track indicated above, will surely attain to the<br>highest end.[976] He that has subdued his mind beholds in his own self,<br>by the aid of his own knowledge the Uncreate, Ancient, Undeteriorating,<br>and Eternal Brahma,&#8212;That, viz., which can not be attained to except by<br>fixed senses,&#8212;That which is subtiler than the most subtile, and grosser<br>than the most gross, and which is Emancipation's self.'[977]<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'By ascertaining from the mouths of preceptors and by<br>themselves reflecting with their minds upon these words of the great and<br>high-souled Rishi spoken so properly, persons possessed of wisdom attain<br>to that equality (about which the scriptures say) with Brahman himself,<br>till, indeed, the time when the universal dissolution comes that swallows<br>up all existent beings.'"[978]
