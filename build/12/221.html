                            "Yudhishthira said, 'The three regenerate classes, who are given to<br>sacrifices and other rites, sometimes eat the remnants, consisting of<br>meat and wine, of sacrifices in honour of the deities, from motives of<br>obtaining children and heaven. What, O grandsire, is the character of<br>this act?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Those who eat forbidden food without being observant of<br>the sacrifices and vows ordained in the Vedas are regarded as wilful men.<br>(They are regarded as fallen even here). Those, on the other hand, who<br>eat such food in the observance of Vedic sacrifices and vows and induced<br>by the desire of fruits in the shape of heaven and children, ascend to<br>heaven but fall down on the exhaustion of their merits.'[831]<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Common people say that fasting is tapas (penances).<br>Is fasting, however, really so, or is penance something different?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'People do regard fast, measured by months or fortnights<br>or days, as penance. In the opinion, however of the good, such is not<br>penance. On the other hand, fast is an impediment to the acquisition of<br>the knowledge of the Soul.[832] The renunciation of acts (that is so<br>difficult for all) and humility (consisting in the worship of all<br>creatures and consideration for them all) constitute the highest penance.<br>That is distinguished above all kinds of penance. He who betakes himself<br>to such penance is regarded as one that is always fasting and that is<br>always leading a life of Brahmacharya. Such a Brahmana will become a Muni<br>always, a deity evermore, and sleepless forever, and one engaged in the<br>pursuit of virtue only, even if he lives in the bosom of a family. He<br>will become a vegetarian always, and pure for ever. He will become an<br>eater always of ambrosia, and an adorer always of gods and guests.<br>Indeed, he will be regarded as one always subsisting on sacrificial<br>remnants, as one ever devoted to the duty of hospitality, as one always<br>full of faith, and as one ever worshipping gods and guests.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'How can one practising such penance come to be<br>regarded as one that is always fasting or as one that is ever devoted to<br>the vow of Brahmacharya, or as one that is always subsisting upon<br>sacrificial remnants or as one that is ever regardful of guests?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'He will be regarded as one that is always fasting if he<br>eats once during the day and once during the night at the fixed hours<br>without eating anything during the interval. Such a Brahmana, by always<br>speaking the truth and by adhering always to wisdom, and by going to his<br>wife only in her season and never at other times, becomes a Brahmacharin<br>(celibate). By never eating meat of animals not killed for sacrifice, he<br>will become a strict vegetarian. By always becoming charitable he will<br>become ever pure, and by abstaining from sleep during the day he will<br>become one that is always wakeful. Know, O Yudhishthira, that that man<br>who eats only after having fed his servants and guests becomes an eater<br>always of ambrosia. That Brahmana who never eats till gods and guests are<br>fed, wins, by such abstention, heaven itself. He is said to subsist upon<br>sacrificial remnants, who eats only what remains after feeding the gods,<br>the Pitris, servants, and guests. Such men win numberless regions of<br>felicity in next life. To their homes come, with Brahman himself, the<br>gods and the Apsaras. They who share their food with the deities and the<br>Pitris pass their days in constant happiness with their sons and<br>grandsons and at last, leaving off this body, attain to a very high end.'"
