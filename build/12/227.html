                            "Yudhishthira said, 'What, indeed, is good for a man that is sunk in dire<br>distress, when loss of friends or loss of kingdom, O monarch has<br>occurred? In this world, O bull of Bharata's race, thou art the foremost<br>of our instructors. I ask thee this. It behoveth thee to tell me what I<br>ask.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'For one that has been deprived of sons and wives and<br>pleasures of every kind and wealth, and that has been plunged into dire<br>distress, fortitude is of the highest good, O king! The body is never<br>emaciated of one that is always possessed of fortitude. Grieflessness<br>bears happiness within it, and also health that is a superior possession.<br>In consequence again of this health of body, once may again acquire<br>prosperity. That wise man, O sire, who adheres to a course of righteous<br>conduct (while afflicted by distress) succeeds in acquiring prosperity,<br>patience, and perseverance in the accomplishment of all his objects. In<br>this connection is once more cited the old narrative of the discourse<br>between Vali and Vasava, O Yudhishthira! After the battle between the<br>gods and the Asuras, in which a large number of Daityas and Danavas fell,<br>had come to an end. Vali became king. He was deceived by Vishnu who once<br>more established his sway over all the worlds. He, of a hundred<br>sacrifices was once more invested with the sovereignty of the deities.<br>After the rule of the deities had thus been re-established, and the four<br>orders of men had been re-established in the practice of their respective<br>courses of duty, the three worlds once more swelled with prosperity, and<br>the Self-born became glad at heart. At that time, accompanied by the<br>Rudras, the Vasus, the Adityas, the Aswins, the celestial Rishis, the<br>Gandharvas, the Siddhas, and other superior orders of beings, the<br>puissant Sakra, seated in splendour on his four-tusked prince of<br>elephants, called Airavata, made a progress through all the worlds. One<br>day, while thus engaged, the wielder of the thunderbolt beheld<br>Virochana's son Vali within a certain mountain cave on the sea-shore.<br>Seeing the prince of Danavas, he approached him. Beholding the chief of<br>the deities, viz., Indra, thus seated on the back of Airavata and<br>surrounded by the several orders of the celestials, the prince of the<br>Daityas showed no signs of sorrow or agitation. Indra also, seeing Vali<br>staying unmoved and fearless, addressed him from the back of his foremost<br>of elephants, saying, 'How is it, O Daitya, that thou art so unmoved? Is<br>it due to thy heroism or thy having waited with reverence upon aged<br>persons? Is it due to thy mind having been cleansed by penances? To<br>whatever cause it may be due, this frame of mind is certainly very<br>difficult of attainment. Hurled from a position that was certainly the<br>highest, thou art now divested of all thy possessions, and thou hast been<br>brought under the sway of thy foes. O son of Virochana, what is that by<br>having recourse to which thou dost not grieve although the occasion is<br>for grief? Formerly, when thou wert invested with the sovereignty of thy<br>own order, unrivalled pleasures were thine. Now, however, thou art<br>divested of thy wealth and jewels and sovereignty. Tell us why thou art<br>so unmoved. Thou wert before this a god, seated on the throne of thy sire<br>and grandsires. Beholding thyself stripped today by thy foes, why dost<br>thou not grieve? Thou art bound in Varuna's noose and hast been struck<br>with my thunderbolt. Thy wives have been taken away and thy wealth also.<br>Tell us why thou dost not indulge in grief. Divested of prosperity and<br>fallen away from affluence, thou indulgest not in grief. This, indeed, is<br>something that is very remarkable. Who else, O Vali, than one like thee,<br>could venture to bear the burthen of existence after being shorn of the<br>sovereignty of the three worlds?' Hearing without any pain these and<br>other cutting speeches that Indra addressed to him, asserting the while<br>his own superiority over him, Vali, the son of Virochana, fearlessly<br>answered his interrogator, saying the following words.'<br><br>"Vali said, 'When calamities have oppressed me, O Sakra, what dost thou<br>gain by such brag now? Today I behold thee, O Purandara, stand before me<br>with the thunderbolt upraised in thy hand! Formerly, however, thou<br>couldst not bear thyself so. Now thou hast by some means gained that<br>power. Indeed, who else than thou could utter such cruel speeches? That<br>person who, though able to punish, shows compassion towards a heroic foe<br>vanquished and brought under his sway, is truly a very superior<br>individual. When two persons fight, victory in the battle is certainly<br>dubious. One of the two certainly becomes victorious, and the other<br>becomes vanquished. O chief of the deities, let not thy disposition be<br>such! Do not imagine that thou hast become the sovereign of all creatures<br>after having conquered all with thy might and prowess! That we have<br>become so is not, O Sakra, the result of any act of ours.[855] That thou<br>hast become so, O wielder of the thunderbolt, is not the result of any<br>act of thine. What I am now thou wilt be in the future. Do not disregard<br>me, thinking that thou hast done an exceedingly difficult feat. A person<br>obtains happiness and misery one after another in course of Time. Thou<br>hast, O Sakra, obtained the sovereignty of the universe in course of Time<br>but not in consequence of any especial merit in thee. It is Time that<br>leads me on in his course. That same Time leads thee also onward. It is<br>for this that I am not what thou art today, and thou also art not what we<br>are! Dutiful services done to parents, reverential worship of deities,<br>due practice of any good quality,&#8212;none of these can bestow happiness on<br>any one. Neither knowledge, nor penances, nor gifts, nor friends, nor<br>kinsmen can rescue one that is afflicted by Time. Men are incapable of<br>averting, by even a thousand means, an impending calamity. Intelligence<br>and strength go for nothing in such cases. There is no rescuer of men<br>that are afflicted by Time's course. That thou, O Sakra, regarded thyself<br>as the actor lies at the root of all sorrow. If the ostensible doer of an<br>act is the real actor thereof, that doer then would not himself be the<br>work of some one else (viz., the Supreme Being). Hence, because the<br>ostensible doer is himself the product of another, that another is the<br>Supreme Being above whom there is nothing higher. Aided by Time I had<br>vanquished thee. Aided by Time thou hast vanquished me. It is Time that<br>is the mover of all beings that move. It is Time that destroys all<br>beings. O Indra, in consequence of thy intelligence being of the vulgar<br>species thou seest not that destruction awaits all things. Some, indeed,<br>regard thee highly as one that has acquired by his own acts the<br>sovereignty of the universe. For all that, how can one like us that know<br>the course of the world, indulge in grief in consequence of having been<br>afflicted by Time, or suffer our understanding to be stupefied, or yield<br>to the influence of error? Shall my understanding or that of one like me,<br>even when we are overwhelmed by Time, coming in contact with a calamity,<br>suffer itself to be destroyed like a wrecked vessel at sea?[856] Myself,<br>thyself, and all those who will in future become the chiefs of the<br>deities, shall have, O Sakra, to go the way along which hundreds of<br>Indras have gone before thee. When thy hour matures itself, Time will<br>surely destroy thee like me,&#8212;thee that art now so invincible and that<br>now blazest with unrivalled splendour. In Time's course many thousands of<br>Indras and of deities have been swept off yuga after yuga. Time, indeed,<br>is irresistible. Having attained to thy present position, thou regardest<br>thyself very highly, even as the Creator of all beings, the divine and<br>eternal Brahman. This position of thine had been attained by many before<br>thee. With none did it prove stable or unending. In consequence, however,<br>of a foolish understanding, thou alone regardest it to be immutable and<br>eternal. Thou trustest in that which is not deserving of trust. Thou<br>deemest that to be eternal which is not eternal. O chief of the deities,<br>one that is overwhelmed and stupefied by Time really regards oneself<br>after this manner. Led by folly thou regardest thy present regal<br>prosperity to be thine. Know, however, that it is never stable in respect<br>of either thee or me or others. It had belonged to innumerable persons<br>before thee. Passing over them, it has now become thine. It will stay<br>with thee, O Vasava, for some time and then prove its instability. Like a<br>cow abandoning one drinking ditch for another, it will surely desert thee<br>for somebody else. So many sovereigns have gone before thee that I<br>venture not to make an enumeration. In the future also, O Purandara,<br>innumerable sovereigns will rise after thee. I do not behold those rulers<br>now that had formerly enjoyed this earth with her trees and plants and<br>gems and living creatures and waters and mines. Prithu, Aila, Maya,<br>Bhima, Naraka, Samvara, Aswagriva, Puloman, Swarbhanu, whose standard was<br>of immeasurable height, Prahlada, Namuchi, Daksha, Vipprachitti,<br>Virochana, Hrinisheva, Suhotra, Bhurihan, Pushavat, Vrisha, Satyepsu,<br>Rishava, Vahu, Kapilaswa, Virupaka, Vana, Kartaswara, Vahni,<br>Viswadanshtra, Nairiti, Sankocha, Varitaksha, Varaha, Aswa, Ruchiprabha,<br>Viswajit, Pratirupa, Vrishanda, Vishkara, Madhu, Hiranyakasipu, the<br>Danava Kaitabha, and many others that were Daityas and Danavas and<br>Rakshasas, these and many more unnamed, belonging to remote and remoter<br>ages, great Daityas and foremost of Danavas, whose names we have<br>heard,&#8212;indeed, many foremost of Daityas of former times,&#8212;having gone<br>away, leaving the Earth. All of them were afflicted by Time. Time proved<br>stronger than all of them. All of them had worshipped the Creator in<br>hundreds of sacrifices. Thou art not the one person that hast done so.<br>All of them were devoted to righteousness and all of them always<br>performed great sacrifices. All of them were capable of roaming through<br>the skies, and all were heroes that never showed their backs in battle.<br>All of them had very strong frames and all had arms that resembled heavy<br>bludgeons. All of them were masters of hundreds of illusions, and all<br>could assume any form they wished. We have never heard that having<br>engaged themselves in battle any of them had ever sustained a defeat. All<br>were firm observers of the vow of truth, and all of them sported as they<br>wished. Devoted to the Vedas and Vedic rites, all of them were possessors<br>of great learning. Possessed of great might, all of them had acquired the<br>highest prosperity and affluence. But none of those high-souled<br>sovereigns had the least tincture of pride in consequence of sovereignty.<br>All of them were liberal, giving unto each what each deserved. All of<br>them behaved properly and duly towards all creatures. All of them were<br>the offspring of Daksha's daughters. Endued with great strength, all were<br>lords of the creation. Scorching all things with the energy all of them<br>blazed with splendour. Yet all of them were swept off by time. As regards<br>thee, O Sakra, it is evident that when thou shalt have, after enjoying<br>the earth, to leave her, thou wilt not be able to control thy grief. Cast<br>off this desire that thou cherishest for objects of affection and<br>enjoyment. Cast off this pride that is born of prosperity. If thou actest<br>in this manner, thou wilt then be able to bear the grief that attends the<br>loss of sovereignty. When the hour of sorrow comes, do not yield to<br>sorrow. Similarly, when the hour of joy comes, do not rejoice.<br>Disregarding both the past and the future, live contentedly with the<br>present. When Time that never sleeps came upon me that had always been<br>heedful of my duties, turn thy heart to the ways of peace, O Indra, for<br>that same Time will very soon come over thee! Thou piercest me with thy<br>words, and thou seemest to be bent upon inspiring dread in me. Indeed,<br>finding me collected, thou regardest thy own self very highly. Time had<br>first assailed me. It is even now behind thee. I was at first vanquished<br>by Time. It was for that reason that thou didst afterwards succeed in<br>vanquishing me for which thou roarest in pride thus. Formerly, when I<br>happened to become angry, what person was there on earth that could stand<br>before me in battle? Time, however, is stronger. He has overwhelmed me.<br>It is for this reason, O Vasava, that thou art able to stand before me!<br>Those thousand (celestial years), that are the measure of thy sway, will<br>surely come to an end. Thou shalt then fall and thy limbs will become as<br>miserable as mine now even though I am possessed of mighty energy. I have<br>fallen away from the high place that is occupied by the sovereign of the<br>three worlds. Thou art now the actual Indra in heaven. In this delightful<br>world of living beings, thou art now, in consequence of Time's course, an<br>object of universal adoration. Canst thou say what is that by having done<br>which thou hast become Indra today and what also is that by having done<br>which we have fallen off from the position we had? Time is the one<br>creator and destroyer. Nothing else is cause (in the universe for the<br>production of any effect). Decline, fall, sovereignty, happiness, misery,<br>birth and death,&#8212;a learned person by encountering any of these neither<br>rejoices nor indulges in sorrow. Thou, O Indra, knowest us. We also, O<br>Vasava, know thee. Why then dost thou brag in this fashion before me,<br>forgetting, O shameless one, that it is Time that hath made thee what<br>thou art? Thou didst thyself witness what my prowess was in those days.<br>The energy and might I used to display in all my battles, furnish<br>sufficient evidence. The Adityas, the Rudras, the Sadhyas, the Vasus, and<br>the Maruts, O lord of Sachi, were all vanquished by me. Thou knowest it<br>well thyself, O Sakra, that in the great encounter between the gods and<br>the Asuras, the assembled deities were quickly routed by me by the fury<br>of my attack. Mountains with their forests and the denizens that lived in<br>those forests, were repeatedly hurled by us. Many were the mountain<br>summits with craggy edges that I broke on thy head. What, however, can I<br>do now? Time is incapable of being resisted. If it were not so, do not<br>think that I would not have ventured to kill thee with that thunderbolt<br>of thine with even a blow of my fist. The present, however, is not the<br>hour with me for the display of prowess. The hour that hath come is such<br>that I should adopt tranquillity now and tolerate everything. It is for<br>this reason, O Sakra, that I put up with all this insolence of thine.<br>Know, however, that I am less able to bear insolence than even thou. Thou<br>braggest before one who, upon his time having matured, is surrounded on<br>all sides by Time's conflagration and bound strongly in Time's cords.<br>Yonder stands that dark individual who is incapable of being resisted by<br>the world. Of fierce form, he stands there, having bound me like an<br>inferior animal bound with cords. Gain and loss, happiness and misery,<br>lust and wrath, birth and death, captivity and release,&#8212;these all one<br>encounters in Time's course. I am not the actor. Thou art not the actor.<br>He is the actor who, indeed, is omnipotent. That Time ripens me (for<br>throwing me down) like a fruit that has appeared on a tree. There are<br>certain acts by doing which one person obtains happiness in Time's<br>course. By doing those very acts another obtains misery in the course of<br>Time. Versed as I am with the virtues of Time, it behoves me not to<br>indulge in grief when it is Time that has assailed me. It is for this<br>reason, O Sakra, that I do not grieve. Grief cannot do us any good. The<br>grief of one that indulges in grief never dispels one's calamity. On the<br>other hand, grief destroys one's power. It is for this that I do not<br>indulge in grief.'<br><br>"Thus addressed by the chief of the Daityas, he of a hundred sacrifices,<br>viz., the puissant and thousand-eyed chastiser of Paka, restrained his<br>wrath and said these words.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'Beholding this upraised arm of mine, equipped with the<br>thunderbolt, and those nooses of Varuna, who is there whose understanding<br>would not be agitated, including the very Destroyer himself that<br>compasses the death of all beings? Thy understanding, however, so firm<br>and so endued with vision of the truth, hath not been agitated. O thou of<br>invincible prowess, verily, thou art unmoved today in consequence of thy<br>fortitude. Beholding all things in this universe to be fleeting, who is<br>there in it, endued with body, that would venture to repose confidence on<br>either his body or all the objects of his desire? Like thyself I also<br>know that this universe is not eternal, and that it has been thrown into<br>Time's conflagration that is dreadful though hidden from the view, that<br>is continuously burning, and that is truly endless. Every one is assailed<br>here by Time. Nothing among beings that are subtile or gross enjoys an<br>immunity from Time's sway. All things are being cooked in Time's<br>cauldron. Time has no master. Time is ever heedful. Time is always<br>cooking all things within itself. No one who has once entered the domain<br>of Time which is ceaselessly going on, can escape therefrom. All embodied<br>beings may be heedless of Time, but Time is heedful and is broad awake<br>behind them. No one has ever been seen to have driven off Time from him.<br>Ancient and eternal, and the embodiment of justice, Time is uniform in<br>respect of all living creatures. Time cannot be avoided, and there is no<br>retrogression in its course. Like a usurer adding up his interest, Time<br>adds up its subtile portions represented by kalas, and lavas, and<br>kashthas, and kshanas, and months, and days and nights. Like the current<br>of a river washing away a tree whose roots are reached by it, Time,<br>getting at him who says, 'This I will do today but this other act I will<br>do tomorrow' sweeps him away. Time sweeps away one and men exclaim, 'I<br>saw him a little while ago. How has he died?' Wealth, comforts, rank,<br>prosperity, all fall a prey to Time. Approaching every living creature,<br>Time snatches away his life. All things that proudly raise their heads<br>high are destined to fall down. That which is existent is only another<br>form of the non-existent. Everything is transitory and unstable. Such a<br>conviction is, however, difficult to come at. Thy understanding, so firm<br>and endued with true vision, is unmoved. Thou dost not, even mentally,<br>realise what thou wert some time ago. Time that is strong, assailing the<br>universe, cooks it within itself and sweeps away everything without<br>consideration of seniority of years or the reverse. For all that, one<br>that is being dragged by Time is unconscious of the noose thrown round<br>one's neck. People, given to jealousy and vanity and cupidity to lust,<br>wrath, and fear, to desire, heedlessness, and pride, suffer themselves to<br>be stupefied. Thou, however, art acquainted with the truth of existence.<br>Thou art possessed of learning and endued with wisdom and penance. Thou<br>beholdest Time as clearly as if it were an emblic myrobalan on the palm<br>of thy hand. O son of Virochana, fully conversant art thou with the topic<br>of Time's conduct. Thou art well-versed in all branches of knowledge.<br>Thou art of cleansed Soul and a thorough master of thy persons. Thou art,<br>for this, an object of affection with all persons endued with wisdom.<br>Thou hast, with thy understanding, fully comprehended the whole universe.<br>Though thou hast enjoyed every kind of happiness, thou art never attached<br>to anything, and hence thou hast not been stained by anything. The<br>qualities of Passion and Darkness do not soil thee for thou hast<br>conquered thy senses. Thou waitest only upon thy Soul which is divested<br>of both joy and sorrow. The friend of all creatures, without animosity,<br>with thy heart set upon tranquillity, beholding thee thus, my heart is<br>inclined to compassion towards thee. I do not desire to afflict an<br>enlightened person like thee by keeping him in an enchained condition.<br>Abstention from injury is the highest religion. I feel compassion towards<br>thee. These nooses of Varuna, with which thou hast been bound, will<br>loosen Time's course in consequence of the misconduct of men. Blessed be<br>thou, O great Asura! When the daughter-in-law will set the aged<br>mother-in-law to work, when the son, through delusion, will command the<br>sire to work for him, when Sudras will have their feet washed by<br>Brahmanas and have sexual congress fearlessly with women of regenerate<br>families, when men will discharge the vital seed into forbidden wombs,<br>when the refuse of houses will begin to be carried upon plates and<br>vessels made of white brass, and when sacrificial offerings intended for<br>the deities will begin to be borne upon forbidden vessels, when all the<br>four orders will transgress all restraints, then these bonds of thine<br>will begin one by one, to loosen. From us thou hast no fear. Wait<br>quietly. Be happy. Be divested of all sorrow. Let thy heart be cheerful.<br>Let no illness be thine.' Having said these words unto him, the divine<br>Indra, having the prince of elephants for his vehicle, left that spot.<br>Having vanquished all the Asuras, the chief of the deities rejoiced in<br>gladness and became the one sole lord of all the worlds. The great Rishis<br>hymned the praises of that lord of all mobile and immobile creatures. The<br>deity of fire once more began to bear the libations of clarified butter<br>that were poured (by all) into his visible form, and the great god took<br>charge of the nectar that was committed to his care. His praises hymned<br>by the foremost of Brahmanas engaged in sacrifices, the lord Indra,<br>blazing with splendour, his wrath pacified, and his heart tranquillised,<br>became gladdened, and returning to his own abode in heaven, began to pass<br>his days in great happiness.'"[857]
