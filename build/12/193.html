                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I think, O grandsire, that thou art acquainted with<br>everything, O thou that art conversant with duties. I desire to hear thee<br>discourse to me, O sinless one, of the ordinances about conduct.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'They that are of bad conduct, of bad acts, of wicked<br>understanding, and excessive rashness, are called evil or wicked men.<br>They, however, that are called good are distinguished by purity of<br>conduct and practices. They are good men who never answer calls of nature<br>on the high roads, in cow-pens, or in fields overgrown with paddy. Having<br>finished the necessary acts one should perform his ablutions in<br>river-water and gratify the deities with oblations of water. This is said<br>to be the duty of all men. Surya should be always worshipped. One should<br>not sleep after sunrise. Morning and evening the prayers (ordained in the<br>scriptures) should be said, sitting with face turned towards the east and<br>towards the west respectively. Washing the five limbs,[589] one should<br>eat silently with face turned towards the east. One should never<br>disparage the food which one is to eat. One should eat food that is good<br>to the taste. After eating one should wash one's hands and rise.[590] One<br>should never go to sleep at night with wet feet. The celestial Rishi<br>Narada said that these are indications of good conduct. One should every<br>day circumambulate a sacred spot, a bull, a sacred image, a cow-pen, a<br>place where four roads meet, a pious Brahmana, and sacred tree. One<br>should not make distinctions between one's guests and attendants and<br>kinsmen in matters of food. Equality (in this respect) with servants is<br>applauded. Eating (twice a day) in the morning and evening is an<br>ordinance of the gods. It is not laid down that one should eat (once<br>more) at any intermediate period. He who eats according to this rule<br>acquires the merit of a fast.[591] At the hours ordained for Homa one<br>should pour libations on the sacred fire. Without seeking the<br>companionship of other people's wives, the man of wisdom who seeks his<br>own wife in her season acquires the merit of Brahmacharyya. The remnants<br>of a Brahmana's dish are like ambrosia. They are like the lacteal<br>sustenance that is yielded by the mother's breast. People highly prize<br>those remnants. The good, by eating them attain to Brahma. He who pounds<br>turf to clay (for making sacrificial altars), or he who cuts grass (for<br>making sacrificial fuel), or he who uses his nails only (and not weapons<br>of any kind) for eating (sanctified meat), or he who always subsists on<br>the remnants of Brahmana's dishes, or he who acts, induced by desire for<br>reward, has not to live long in the world.[592] One who has abstained<br>from meat (under any vow) should not take meat even if it be sanctified<br>with mantras from the Yajurveda. One should also avoid the flesh about<br>the vertebral column (of any animal) and the flesh of animals not slain<br>in sacrifices.[593] Whether at one's own place or in a strange land, one<br>should never cause one's guest to fast. Having obtained alms and other<br>fruits of optional acts, one should offer them to one's seniors. One<br>should offer seats to one's seniors and salute them with respect. By<br>worshipping one's seniors, one obtains long life, fame, and prosperity.<br>One should never behold the Sun at the moment of rising, nor should one<br>turn one's gaze towards a naked woman that is another man's spouse.<br>Congress with one's wife (in her season) is not sinful but it is an act<br>that should always be done in privacy. The heart of all sacred spots and<br>shrines is the Preceptor. The heart of all pure and cleansing things is<br>Fire. All acts done by a good and pious person are good and laudable,<br>including even the touching of the hair of a cow's tail. Every time one<br>meets with another, one should make polite enquiries. The saluting of<br>Brahmanas every morning and evening is ordained. In temples of gods, amid<br>cows, in performing the rites of religion laid down for Brahmanas, in<br>reading the Vedas, and in eating, the right hand should be raised.[594]<br>The worship of Brahmanas, morning and evening, according to due rites,<br>produces great merit. In consequence of such worship the stock-in-trade<br>of the merchant, become abundant and the produce of the agriculturist.<br>Great also becomes the yield of all kinds of corn and the supply of all<br>articles that the senses can enjoy becomes copious. When giving eatables<br>to another (seated at his dish), one should say, 'Is it sufficient?' When<br>presenting drink, one should ask, 'Will it gratify,' and when giving<br>sweetened milk and rice, or sugared gruel of barley, or milk with sesame<br>or pease, one should ask 'Has it fallen?'[595] After shaving, after<br>spitting, after bathing, and after eating, people should worship<br>Brahmanas with reverence, Such worship is sure to bestow longevity on<br>sickly men. One should not pass urine with face turned towards the sun,<br>nor should one see one's own excreta. One should not lie on the same bed<br>with a woman, nor eat with her. In addressing seniors one should never<br>apply the pronoun you to them or take their names. Thouing or the taking<br>of names is not censurable in addressing inferiors or equals in age.[596]<br>The hearts of sinful men betray the sins committed by them. Those sinful<br>men that conceal their conscious sins from good men meet with<br>destruction. Only ignorant fools seek to conceal the sins which they<br>commit consciously. It is true that human beings do not see those sins<br>but the gods see them. A sin concealed by another sin leads to fresh<br>sins. An act of merit, again, if concealed by an act of merit, increases<br>the merit. The acts of a virtuous man always follow in the wake of<br>virtue. A man destitute of understanding never thinks of the sins<br>committed by him. Those sins, however, overtake the doer that has fallen<br>away from the scriptures. As Rahu comes to Chandra (at his proper time),<br>those sinful acts come to the foolish man.[597] The objects that are<br>stored with expectation are scarcely enjoyed. Such storing is never<br>applauded by the wise, for death waits for no one (but snatches his prey<br>whether the latter be ready or unready). The wise have said that the<br>righteousness of all creatures is an attribute of the mind. For this<br>reason, one should, in one's mind, do good to all.[598] One should<br>practise virtue singly. In the practice of virtue one has no need for the<br>help of others. If one obtains only the ordinances of the scriptures,<br>what can an associate do?[599] Righteousness is the origin of mankind.<br>Righteousness is the ambrosia of the gods. After death, men enjoy,<br>through Righteousness, eternal happiness.'
