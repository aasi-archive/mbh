                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Having acquired great power and great wealth, and<br>having obtained a long period of life, how may one succeed in avoiding<br>death? By which of these means, viz., penances, or the accomplishment of<br>the diverse acts (laid down in the Vedas), or by knowledge of the Srutis,<br>or the application of medicines, can one succeed in avoiding decrepitude<br>and death?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative of<br>Panchasikha who was a Bhikshu in his practices and Janaka. Once on a time<br>Janaka, the ruler of the Videhas, questioned the great Rishi Panchasikha,<br>who was the foremost of all persons conversant with the Vedas and who had<br>all his doubts removed in respect of the purpose and import of all<br>duties. The King said,&#8212;By what conduct, O holy one may one transcend<br>decrepitude and death? It is by penances, or by the understanding, or by<br>religious acts (like sacrifices, and vows), or by study and knowledge of<br>the scriptures?&#8212;Thus addressed by the ruler of the Vedas the learned<br>Panchasikha, conversant with all invisible things, answered,<br>saying,&#8212;There is no prevention of these two (viz., decrepitude and<br>death); nor is it true that cannot be prevented under any circumstances.<br>Neither days, nor nights, nor months, cease to go on. Only that man, who,<br>though transitory, betakes himself to the eternal path (of the religion<br>of Nivritti or abstention from all acts) succeeds in avoiding birth and<br>death. Destruction overtakes, all creatures. All creatures seem to be<br>ceaselessly borne along the infinite current of time. Those that are<br>borne along the infinite current of time which is without a raft (to<br>rescue) and which is infested by those two mighty alligators, viz.,<br>decrepitude and death, sink down without anybody coming to their<br>assistance. As one is swept along that current, one fails to find any<br>friend for help and one fails to be inspired with interest for any one<br>else. One meets with spouses and other friends only on one's road. One<br>had never before enjoyed this kind of companionship with any one for any<br>length of time. Creatures, as they are borne along the current of time,<br>become repeatedly attracted towards one another like masses of clouds<br>moved by the wind meeting one another with loud sound. Decrepitude and<br>death are devourers of all creatures, like wolves. Indeed, they devour<br>the strong and the weak, the short and the tall. Among creatures,<br>therefore, which are all so transitory, only the Soul exists eternally.<br>Why should he, then, rejoice when creatures are born and why should he<br>grieve when they die? Whence have I come. Who am I? Whither shall I go?<br>Whose am I? Before what do I rest? What shall I be? For what reason then<br>dost thou grieve for what? Who else then thou wilt behold heaven or hell<br>(for what thou doest)? Hence, without throwing aside the scriptures, one<br>should make gifts and perform sacrifices!&#8212;"
