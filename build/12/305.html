                            "'Vasishtha said, 'It is thus, in consequence of his Ignorance and his<br>association with others that are invested with Ignorance, that Jiva has<br>recourse to millions and millions of births every one of which has<br>dissolution in the end. In consequence of his transformation into Chit<br>invested with Ignorance, Jiva betakes himself to millions of abodes one<br>of which is liable to end in destruction, among intermediate beings and<br>men and the deities. In consequence of Ignorance, Jiva, like Chandramas,<br>has to wax and wane thousands and thousands of times. This is truly the<br>nature of Jiva when invested with ignorance. Know that Chandramas has in<br>reality full sixteen portions. Only fifteen of these are subject to<br>increase and decrease. The sixteenth (i.e., that portion which remains<br>invisible and which appears on the night of the New-moon) remains<br>constant. After the manner of Chandramas, Jiva too has full sixteen<br>portions. Only fifteen of these, (viz., Prakriti with Chit's reflection,<br>the ten senses of knowledge and action, and the four inner faculties)<br>appear and disappear. The sixteenth (viz., Chit in its purity) is subject<br>to no modification. Invested with Ignorance, Jiva repeatedly and<br>continually takes birth in the fifteen portions named above. With the<br>eternal and immutable portion on Jiva primal essence become united and<br>this union takes place repeatedly. That sixteenth portion is subtile. It<br>should be known as Soma (eternal and immutable). It is never upheld by<br>the senses. On the other hand, the senses are upheld by it. Since those<br>sixteen portions are the cause of the birth of creatures, creatures can<br>never, O monarch, take birth without their aid. They are called Prakriti.<br>The destruction of Jiva's liability to be united with Prakriti is called<br>Emancipation. The Mahat-Soul, which is the twenty-fifth, if it regards<br>that body of sixteen portions called the Unmanifest,[1617] has to assume<br>it repeatedly. In consequence of not knowing, That which is stainless and<br>pure, and for its devotion to what is the result of a combination of both<br>Pure and Impure, the Soul, which is in reality pure, becomes, O king<br>Impure. Indeed, in consequence of its devotion to Ignorance, Jiva, though<br>characterised by Knowledge becomes repeatedly associated with Ignorance.<br>Though, O monarch, free from error of every kind, yet in consequence of<br>its devotion to the three attributes of Prakriti, it becomes endued with<br>those attributes.'"
