                            "Jajali said, 'This course of duty that thou, O holder of scales,<br>preachest, closes the door of heaven against all creatures and puts a<br>stop to the very means of their subsistence. From agriculture comes food.<br>That food offers subsistence even to thee. With the aid of animals and of<br>crops and herbs, human beings, O trader, are enabled to support their<br>existence. From animals and food sacrifices flow. Thy doctrines smack of<br>atheism. This world will come to an end if the means by which life is<br>supported have to be abandoned.'<br><br>"Tuladhara said, 'I shall now speak on the object of the means of<br>sustenance. I am not, O Brahmana, an atheist. I do not blame Sacrifices.<br>The man, however, is very rare that is truly conversant with Sacrifice. I<br>bow to that Sacrifice which is ordained for Brahmanas. I bow also to them<br>that are conversant with that Sacrifice. Alas, the Brahmanas, having<br>given up the Sacrifice that is ordained for them, have betaken themselves<br>to the performance of Sacrifices that are for Kshatriyas.[1165] Many<br>persons of faith, O regenerate one, that are covetous and fond of wealth,<br>without having understood the true meaning of the declarations of the<br>Srutis, and proclaiming things that are really false but that have the<br>show of truth, have introduced many kinds of Sacrifices, saying, 'This<br>should be given away in this Sacrifice. This other thing should be given<br>away in this other Sacrifice. The first of this is very laudable.' The<br>consequence, however, of all this, O Jajali, is that theft and many evil<br>acts spring up.[1166] It should be known that only that sacrificial<br>offering which was acquired by righteous means can gratify the gods.<br>There are abundant indications in the scriptures that the worship of the<br>deities may be accomplished with vows, with libations poured on the fire,<br>with recitations or chanting of the Vedas, and with plants and herbs.<br>From their religious acts unrighteous persons get wicked offspring. From<br>covetous men are born children that are covetous, and from those that are<br>contented spring children that are contented. If the sacrificer and the<br>priest suffer themselves to be moved by desire of fruit (in respect of<br>the Sacrifices they perform or assist in), their children take the stain.<br>If, on the other hand, they do not yield to desire of fruit, the children<br>born to them become of the same kind. From Sacrifices spring progeny like<br>clear water from the firmament. The libations poured on the sacrificial<br>fire rise up to the Sun. From the Sun springs rain. From rain springs<br>food. From food are born living creatures. In former days, men<br>righteously devoted to Sacrifices used to obtain therefrom the fruition<br>of all their wishes. The earth yielded crops without tillage. The<br>blessing uttered by the Rishis produced herbs and plants.[1167] The men<br>of former times never performed Sacrifices from desire of fruits and<br>never regarded themselves as called upon to enjoy those fruits. Those who<br>somehow perform sacrifices, doubting the while their efficacy take birth<br>in their next lives as dishonest, wily, and greedy men exceedingly<br>covetous of wealth. That man who by the aid of false reasoning holds up<br>all the authoritative scriptures as fraught with evil, is certain to go,<br>for such sinful act of his, into the regions of the sinful. Such a man is<br>certainly possessed of a sinful soul, O foremost of Brahmanas, and always<br>remains here, bereft of wisdom.[1168] That man who regards those acts<br>obligatory which have been laid down in the Vedas and directed to be<br>accomplished every day, who is penetrated with fear if he fails to<br>accomplish them any day, who takes all the essentials of Sacrifice as<br>identical with Brahma, and who never regards himself as the actor, is<br>truly a Brahmana.[1169] If the acts of such a person become incomplete,<br>or if their completion be obstructed by all unclean animals, even then<br>those acts are, as heard by us, of superior efficacy. If, however, those<br>acts are done from desire of fruit (and their completion be obstructed by<br>such impediments), then expiation would become necessary. They who covet<br>the acquisition of the highest object of life (viz., Emancipation), who<br>are bereft of cupidity in respect of all kinds of worldly wealth, who<br>discard all provision for the future, and who are freed from envy, betake<br>themselves to practice of truth and self-restraint as their<br>Sacrifice.[1170] They that are conversant with the distinction between<br>body and soul, that are devoted to Yoga, and that meditate on the<br>Pranava, always succeed in gratifying others.[1171] The universal Brahma<br>(viz., Pranava), which is the soul of the deities, dwells in him who is<br>conversant with Brahma. When, therefore, such a man eats and is<br>gratified, all the deities, O Jajali, become gratified and are<br>contented.[1172] As one who is gratified with all kinds of taste feels no<br>desire for any particular taste, after the same manner one who is<br>gratified with knowledge hath everlasting gratification which to him is a<br>source of perfect bliss. Those wise men who are the refuge of<br>righteousness and whose delight is in righteousness, are persons that<br>have certain knowledge of what is to be done and what should not be done.<br>One possessed of such wisdom always regards all things in the universe to<br>have sprung from his own Self.[1173] Some that are endued with knowledge,<br>that strive to reach the other shore (of this ocean of life), and that<br>are possessed of faith, succeed in attaining to the region of Brahman,<br>which is productive of great blessings, highly sacred, and inhabited by<br>righteous persons,&#8212;a region which is freed from sorrow, whence there is<br>no return, and where there is no kind of agitation or pain. Such men do<br>not covet heaven. They do not adore Brahma in costly sacrifices. They<br>walk along the path of the righteous. The Sacrifices they perform are<br>performed without injury to any creature.[1174] These men know trees and<br>herbs and fruits and roots as the only sacrificial offerings. Covetous<br>priests, for they are desirous of wealth, never officiate at the<br>sacrifices of these (poor) men. These regenerate men, although all their<br>acts have been completed, still perform sacrifices from desire of doing<br>good to all creatures and constituting their own selves as sacrificial<br>offerings.[1175] For this reason, grasping priests officiate at the<br>Sacrifices of only those misguided persons who, without endeavouring to<br>attain to Emancipation, seek for heaven. As regards those, however, that<br>are really good, they always seek, by accomplishing their own duties, to<br>cause others to ascend to heaven. Looking at both these kinds of<br>behaviour, O Jajali, I have (abstained from injuring any creature in the<br>world and have) come to regard all creatures with an equal heart.[1176]<br>Endued with wisdom, many foremost of Brahmanas perform Sacrifices (which<br>with respect to their fruits are of two kinds, for some of them lead to<br>Emancipation whence there is no return, and others lead to regions of<br>bliss whence there is return). By performing those Sacrifices, they<br>proceed, O great ascetic, along paths trodden by the gods. Of one class<br>of Sacrificers (viz., they who sacrifice from desire of fruit) there is<br>return (from the region which they reach). Of those, however, that are<br>truly wise (viz., those who sacrifice without being urged thereto by<br>desire of fruit), there is no return. Although both classes of<br>sacrificers, O Jajali, proceed along the path trodden by the deities (in<br>consequence of the sacrifices they perform), yet such is the difference<br>between their ultimate ends.[1177] In consequence of the success that<br>attends the purposes formed in the mind of such men, bulls, without being<br>forced thereto, willingly set their shoulders to the plough for assisting<br>at tillage and to the yoke for dragging their cars, and kine pour forth<br>milk from udders untouched by human hands. Creating sacrificial stakes<br>(and other necessaries of Sacrifice) by simple flats of the will, they<br>perform many kinds of Sacrifice well-completed with abundant<br>presents.[1178] One who is of such a cleansed soul may slaughter a cow<br>(as an offering in Sacrifice).[1179] They, therefore, that are not of<br>that kind should perform Sacrifices with herbs and plants (and not<br>animals). Since Renunciation hath such merit, it is for that reason that<br>I have kept it before my eyes in speaking to thee.[1180] The gods know<br>him for a Brahmana who has given up all desire of fruit, who hath no<br>exertion in respect of worldly acts, who never bows down his head unto<br>any one, who never utters the praises of others, and who is endued with<br>strength though his acts have all been weakened.[1181] What, O Jajali,<br>will be the end of him who doth not recite the Vedas, unto others, who<br>doth not perform Sacrifices (properly), who doth not make gifts unto<br>(deserving) Brahmanas, and who followeth an avocation in which every kind<br>of desire is indulged? By properly reverencing, however, the duties that<br>appertain to Renunciation, one is sure of attaining to Brahma.'[1182]<br><br>"Jajali said, 'We had never before, O son of a trader, heard of these<br>recondite doctrines of ascetics that perform only mental Sacrifices.<br>These doctrines are exceedingly difficult of comprehension. It is for<br>this reason that I ask thee (about them). The sages of olden days were<br>not followers of those doctrines of Yoga. Hence, the sages that have<br>succeeded them have not propounded them (for general acceptance).[1183]<br>If thou sayest that only men of brutish minds fail to achieve sacrifices<br>in the soil of the Soul, then, O son of a trader, by what acts would they<br>succeed in accomplishing their happiness? Tell me this, O thou of great<br>wisdom! Great is my faith in thy words.'[1184]<br><br>"Tuladhara said, 'Sometimes sacrifices performed by some persons do not<br>become sacrifices (in consequence of the absence of faith of those that<br>perform them). These men, it should be said, are not worthy of performing<br>any sacrifice (internal or external). As regards the faithful, however,<br>only one thing, viz., the cow, is fit for upholding all sacrifices by<br>means of full libations of clarified butter, milk, and curds, the hair at<br>end of her tail, her horns, and her hoofs.[1185] (The Vedas declare that<br>sacrifices cannot be performed by an unmarried man). In performing<br>sacrifices, however, according to the mode I have pointed out (viz., by<br>abstaining from slaughter of animals and dedicating only clarified<br>butter, etc.), one may make Faith one's wedded wife, for dedicating such<br>(innocent) offerings to the deities. By duly reverencing such sacrifices,<br>one is sure to attain to Brahma.[1186] To the exclusion of all animals<br>(which are certainly unclean as offering in sacrifices), the rice-ball is<br>a worthy offering in sacrifices. All rivers are as sacred as the<br>Saraswati, and all mountains are sacred. O Jajali, the Soul is itself a<br>Tirtha. Do not wander about on the earth for visiting sacred places. A<br>person, by observing these duties (that I have spoken of and that do not<br>involve injury to other creatures), and by seeking the acquisition of<br>merit agreeably to his own ability, certainly succeeds in obtaining<br>blessed regions hereafter.'[1187]<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'These are the duties, O Yudhishthira, which<br>Tuladhara applauded,&#8212;duties that are consistent with reason, and that<br>are always observed by those that are good and wise.'"
