                            "Narada said, 'Without doubt, O Salmali, the terrible and irresistible<br>god of the wind always protects thee from friendliness or amity. It<br>seems, O Salmali, that a close intimacy has come to subsist between thee<br>and the Wind. It seems thou hast said unto him these words, viz., 'I am<br>thine,' and it is for this reason that the Wind-god protects thee. I do<br>not see the tree or mountain or mansion in this world that may not, I<br>think, be broken by the Wind. Without doubt thou standest here with all<br>thy branches and twigs and leaves, simply because, O Salmali, thou art<br>protected by the Wind for some reason or reasons (unknown to us).'<br><br>"The Salmali said, 'The Wind, O regenerate one, is neither my friend nor<br>mate nor well-wisher. Indeed, he is neither my great Ordainer that he<br>should protect me. My fierce energy and might, O Narada, are greater than<br>the Wind's. In truth, the strength of the Wind comes up to about only an<br>eighteenth part of mine. When the Wind comes in rage, tearing up trees<br>and mountains and other things, I curb his strength by putting forth<br>mine. Indeed, the Wind that breaks many things has himself been<br>repeatedly broken by me. For this reason, O Celestial Rishi, I am not<br>afraid of him even when he comes in wrath.'<br><br>"Narada said, 'O Salmali, thy protection seems to be thoroughly perverse.<br>There is no doubt in this. There is no created thing which is equal to<br>the Wind in strength. Even Indra, or Yama, or Vaisravana, the lord of the<br>waters, is not equal to the god of the wind in might. What need,<br>therefore, be said of thee that art only a tree? Whatever creature in<br>this world, O Salmali, does whatever act, the illustrious Wind-god it is<br>that is at all times the cause of that act, since it is he that is the<br>giver of life. When that god exerts himself with propriety, he makes all<br>living creatures live at their ease. When, however, he exerts improperly,<br>calamities overtake the creatures of the world. What else can it be than<br>weakness of understanding which induces thee to thus withhold thy worship<br>from the god of wind, that foremost of creatures in the universe, that<br>being deserving of worship? Thou art worthless and of a wicked<br>understanding. Indeed, thou indulgest only in unmeaning brag. Thy<br>intelligence being confounded by wrath and other evil passions, thou<br>speakest only untruths, O Salmali! I am certainly angry with thee for thy<br>indulging in such speeches. I shall myself report to the god of the wind<br>all these derogatory words of thine. Chandanas, and Syandanas, and Salas,<br>and Saralas and Devadarus and Vetavas and Dhanwanas and other trees of<br>good souls that are far stronger than thou art, have never, O thou of<br>wicked understanding, uttered such invectives against the Wind. All of<br>them know the might of the Wind as also the might that is possessed by<br>each of them. For these reasons those foremost of trees bow down their<br>heads in respect to that deity. Thou, however, through folly, knowest not<br>the infinite might of the Wind. I shall, therefore, repair to the<br>presence of that god (for apprising him of thy contempt for him).'"
