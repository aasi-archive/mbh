                            "Vyasa said, 'Borne up and down in life's ocean, he that is capable of<br>meditation seizes the raft of Knowledge and for achieving his<br>Emancipation adheres to Knowledge itself (without extending his arms<br>hither and thither for catching any other support).'[919]<br><br>"Suka said, 'What is that Knowledge? Is it that learning by which, when<br>error is dispelled, the truth becomes discovered? Or, is it that course<br>of duties consisting of acts to be done or achieved, by the aid of which<br>the object sought may be understood or attained? Or, is it that course of<br>duties, called abstention from acts, by which an extension of the Soul is<br>to be sought? Do tell me what it is, so that by its aid, the two, viz.,<br>birth and death, may be avoided.'[920]<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'That fool who believing that all this exists in consequence<br>of its own nature without, in fact, an existent refuge or foundation,<br>fills by such instruction the aspirations of disciples, dispelling by his<br>dialectical ingenuity the reasons the latter might urge to the contrary,<br>succeeds not in attaining to any truth.[921] They again who firmly<br>believe that all Cause is due to the nature of things, fail to acquire<br>any truth by even listening to (wiser) men or the Rishis (who are capable<br>of instructing them).[922] Those men of little intelligence who stop (in<br>their speculations), having adopted either of these doctrines, indeed,<br>those men who regard nature as the cause, never succeed in obtaining any<br>benefit for themselves.[923] This belief in Nature (as the producing and<br>the sustaining Cause), arising as it does from a mind acting under the<br>influence of error, brings about the destruction of the person who<br>cherishes it. Listen now to the truth with respect to these two doctrines<br>that maintain (1) that things exist by their own nature and (2) that they<br>flow (in consequence of their own nature) from others that are different<br>from and that precede them.[924] Wise men apply themselves to agriculture<br>and tillage, and the acquisition of crops (by those means) and of<br>vehicles (for locomotion) and seats and carpets and houses. They attend<br>also to the laying of pleasure-gardens, the construction of commodious<br>mansions, and the preparation of medicines, for diseases of every kind.<br>It is wisdom (which consists in the application of means) that leads to<br>the fruition of purposes. It is wisdom that wins beneficial results. It<br>is wisdom that enables kings to exercise and enjoy sovereignty although<br>they are possessed of attributes equal to those of persons over whom they<br>rule.[925] It is by wisdom that the high and the low among beings are<br>distinguished. It is by wisdom that the superior and the inferior ones<br>among created objects are understood. It is wisdom or knowledge that is<br>the highest refuge of all things.[926] All the diverse kinds of created<br>things have four kinds of birth. They are viviparous, oviparous,<br>vegetables, and those born of filth. Creatures, again, that are mobile<br>should be known to be superior to those that are immobile. It is<br>consistent with reason that intelligent energy, inasmuch as it<br>differentiates (all non-intelligent matter), should be regarded as<br>superior to.(non-intelligent) matter.[927] Mobile creatures, that are<br>innumerable, and of two kinds, viz., those that have many legs and those<br>that have two. The latter, however, are superior to the former. Bipeds,<br>again are of two species, viz., those that live on land and those that<br>are otherwise. Of these, the former are superior to the latter. The<br>superior ones eat diverse kinds of cooked food.[928] Bipeds moving on<br>land are of two kinds viz., middling or intermediate, and those that are<br>foremost. Of these, the middling or intermediate are regarded as superior<br>(to the former) in consequence of their observance of the duties of<br>caste.[929] The middling or intermediate ones are said to be of two<br>kinds, viz., those that are conversant with duties, and those that are<br>otherwise. Of those, the former are superior in consequence of their<br>discrimination in respect of what should be done and what should not.<br>Those conversant with duties are said to be of two kinds, viz., those<br>that are acquainted with the Vedas and those that are otherwise. Of these<br>the former are superior, for the Vedas are said to dwell in them.[930]<br>Those that are acquainted with the Vedas are said to be of two kinds,<br>viz., those that lecture on the Vedas and those that are otherwise. Of<br>these, the former, who are fully conversant with the Vedas, with the<br>duties and the rites laid down in them, and the fruits of those duties<br>and rites, are superior in consequence of their publishing all those<br>duties and rites. Indeed, all the Vedas with the duties laid down in them<br>are said to flow from them. Preceptors of the Vedas are of two kinds,<br>viz., those that are conversant with the Soul and those that are<br>otherwise. Of these, the former are superior in consequence of their<br>knowledge of what is meant by Birth and Death.[931] As regards duties,<br>they are, again, of two kinds (viz., Pravritti and Nivritti). He who is<br>conversant with duties is said to be omniscient or possessed of universal<br>knowledge. Such a man is a Renouncer. Such a man is firm in the<br>accomplishment of his purposes. Such a man is truthful, pure (both<br>outwardly and inwardly), and possessed of puissance.[932] The gods know<br>him for a Brahmana who is devoted to knowledge of Brahma (and not him who<br>is conversant with only the duties of Pravritti). Such a man is versed<br>also in the Vedas and earnestly devoted to the study of the Soul.[933]<br>They that have true knowledge behold their own Soul as existing both in<br>and out. Such men, O child, are truly regenerate and such men are<br>gods.[934] Upon these rests this world of Beings, in them dwell this<br>whole universe. There is nothing that is equal to their greatness.<br>Transcending birth and death and distinctions and acts of every kind,<br>they are the lords of the four kinds of creatures and are the equals of<br>the Self-born himself.'"[935]
