                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Upon the completion of this discourse, Nakula who<br>was an accomplished swordsman thus questioned the Kuru grandsire lying on<br>his bed of arrows.'<br><br>"Nakula said, 'The bow, O grandsire, is regarded as the foremost of<br>weapons in this world. My mind, however, inclines towards the sword,<br>since when the bow, O king, is cut off or broken, when steeds are dead or<br>weakened, a good warrior, well trained in the sword, can protect himself<br>by means of his sword.[479] A hero armed with the sword can, single<br>handed, withstand many bowmen, and many antagonists armed with maces and<br>darts. I have this doubt, and I feel curious to know the truth. Which, O<br>king, is really the foremost of weapons in all battles? How was the sword<br>first created and for what purpose? Who also was the first preceptor in<br>the weapon? Tell me all this, O grandsire.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of the intelligent son of<br>Madri, the virtuous Bhishma, the complete master of the science of the<br>bow, stretched upon his bed of arrows, made this answer fraught with many<br>refined words of delightful import, melodious with vowels properly<br>placed, and displaying considerable skill, unto the high-souled Nakula,<br>that disciple of Drona, endued with skilful training.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Hear the truth, O son of Madri, about what thou hast<br>asked me. I am excited by this question of thine, like a hill of<br>red-chalk.[480] In ancient times the universe was one vast expanse of<br>water, motionless and skyless, and without this earth occupying any space<br>in it. Enveloped in darkness, and intangible, its aspect was exceedingly<br>awful. Utter silence reigning all over, it was immeasurable in extent. In<br>his own proper time the Grandsire (of the universe) took his birth. He<br>then created the wind and fire, and the sun also of great energy. He also<br>created the sky, the heavens, the nether regions, earth, the directions,<br>the firmament with the moon and the stars, the constellations, the<br>planets, the year, the seasons, the months, the two fortnights (lighted<br>and dark) and the smaller divisions of time. The divine Grandsire then,<br>assuming a visible form, begot (by power of his will) some sons possessed<br>of great energy. They are the sages Marichi, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha,<br>Kratu, Vasishtha, Angiras, and the mighty and puissant lord Rudra, and<br>Prachetas. The last begat Daksha, who in his turn, begat sixty daughters.<br>All those daughters were taken by regenerate sages for the object of<br>begetting children upon them. From them sprang all the creatures of the<br>universe, including the gods, Pitris, Gandharvas, Apsaras, diverse kinds<br>of Rakshasas, birds and animals and fishes, monkeys, great snakes, and<br>diverse species of fowl that range the air or sport on the water, and<br>vegetables, and all beings that are oviparous or viviparous or born of<br>filth. In this way the whole universe consisting of mobile and immobile<br>creatures sprang into existence. The universal Grandsire, having thus<br>evoked into existence all mobile and immobile creatures, then promulgated<br>the eternal religion laid down in the Vedas. That religion was accepted<br>by the gods, with their preceptors, priests, the Adityas, the Vasus, the<br>Rudras, the Sadhyas, the Maruts, the Aswins, Bhrigu, Atri, Angiras, the<br>Siddhas, Kasyapa rich in penances, Vasishtha, Gautama, Agastya, Narada,<br>Parvata, the Valikhilya Rishis, those other Rishis known under the names<br>of Prabhasas, the Sikatas, the Ghritapas, the Somavayavyas, the<br>Vaiswanaras, Marichipas, the Akrishtas, the Hansas, those born of Fire,<br>the Vanaprasthas, and the Prasnis. All of them lived in obedience to<br>Brahman. The foremost of the Danavas, however, setting at night the<br>commands of the Grandsire, and yielding to wrath and covetousness, began<br>to cause the destruction of righteousness. They were Hiranyakasipu, and<br>Hiranyaksha, and Virochana, and Samvara, and Viprachitti, and Prahlada,<br>and Namuchi, and Vali. These and many other Daityas and Danavas,<br>transcending all restraints of duty and religion, sported and took<br>delight in all kinds of wicked acts. Regarding themselves equal in point<br>of birth with the gods, they began to challenge them and the sages of<br>pure behaviour. They never did any good to the other creatures of the<br>universe or showed compassion for any of them. Disregarding the three<br>well-known means, they began to persecute and afflict all creatures by<br>wielding only the rod of chastisement. Indeed, those foremost of Asuras,<br>filled with pride, forsook every friendly intercourse with other<br>creatures. Then the divine Brahman, accompanied by the regenerate sages,<br>proceeded to a delightful summit of Himavat, extending for a hundred<br>Yojanas in area, adorned with diverse kinds of jewels and gems, and upon<br>whose surface the stars seemed to rest like so many lotuses on a lake. On<br>that prince of mountains, O sire, overgrown with forests of flowering<br>trees, that foremost of the gods, viz., Brahman, stayed for some time for<br>accomplishing the business of the world. After the lapse of a thousand<br>years, the puissant lord made arrangements for a grand sacrifice<br>according to the ordinances laid down in the scriptures. The sacrificial<br>altar became adorned with Rishis skilled in sacrifice and competent to<br>perform all acts appertaining thereto, with faggots of sacrificial fuel,<br>and with blazing fires. And it looked exceedingly beautiful in<br>consequence of the sacrificial plates and vessels all made of gold. All<br>the foremost ones among the gods took their seats on it. The platform was<br>further adorned with Sadasyas all of whom were high regenerate Rishis. I<br>have heard from the Rishis that soon something very awful occurred in<br>that sacrifice. It is heard that a creature sprang (from the sacrificial<br>fire) scattering the flames around him, and whose splendour equalled that<br>of the Moon himself when he rises in the firmament spangled with stars.<br>His complexion was dark like that of the petals of the blue lotus. His<br>teeth were keen. His stomach was lean. His stature was tall. He seemed to<br>be irresistible and possessed of exceeding energy. Upon the appearance of<br>that being, the earth trembled. The Ocean became agitated with high<br>billows and awful eddies. Meteors foreboding great disasters shot through<br>the sky. The branches of trees began to fall down. All the points of the<br>compass became unquiet. Inauspicious winds began to blow. All creatures<br>began to quake with fear every moment. Beholding that awful agitation of<br>the universe and that Being sprung from the sacrificial fire, the<br>Grandsire said these words unto the great Rishis, the gods, and the<br>Gandharvas. This Being was thought of by me. Possessed of great energy,<br>his name is Asi (sword or scimitar). For the protection of the world and<br>the destruction of the enemies of the gods, I have created him. That<br>being then, abandoning the form he had first assumed, took the shape of a<br>sword of great splendour, highly polished, sharp-edged, risen like the<br>all-destructive Being at the end of the Yuga. Then Brahman made over that<br>sharp weapon to the blue-throated Rudra who has for the device on his<br>banner the foremost of bulls, for enabling him to put down irreligion and<br>sin. At this, the divine Rudra of immeasurable soul, praised by the great<br>Rishis, took up that sword and assumed a different shape. Putting forth<br>four arms, he became so tall that though standing on the earth he touched<br>the very sun with his head. With eyes turned upwards and with every limb<br>extended wide, he began to vomit flames of fire from his mouth. Assuming<br>diverse complexions such as blue and white and red, wearing a black<br>deer-skin studded with stars of gold, he bore on his forehead a third eye<br>that resembled the sun in splendour. His two other eyes, one of which was<br>black and the other tawny, shone very brightly. The divine Mahadeva, the<br>bearer of the Sula, the tearer of Bhaga's eyes, taking up the sword whose<br>splendour resembled that of the all-destructive Yuga fire, and wielding a<br>large shield with three high bosses which looked like a mass of dark<br>clouds adorned with flashes of lightning, began to perform diverse kinds<br>of evolutions. Possessed of great prowess, he began to whirl the sword in<br>the sky, desirous of an encounter. Loud were the roars he uttered, and<br>awful the sound of his laughter. Indeed, O Bharata, the form then assumed<br>by Rudra was exceedingly terrible. Hearing that Rudra had assumed that<br>form for achieving fierce deeds, the Danavas, filled with joy, began to<br>come towards him with great speed, showering huge rocks upon him as they<br>come, and blazing brands of wood, and diverse kinds of terrible weapons<br>made of iron and each endued with the sharpness of a razor. The Danava<br>host, however, beholding that foremost of all beings, the indestructible<br>Rudra, swelling with might, became stupefied and began to tremble.<br>Although Rudra was alone and single-handed, yet so quickly did he move on<br>the field of battle with the sword in his arm that the Asuras thought<br>there were a thousand similar Rudras battling with them. Tearing and<br>piercing and afflicting and cutting and lopping off and grinding down,<br>the great god moved with celerity among the thick masses of his foes like<br>forest conflagration amid heaps of dry grass spread around. The mighty<br>Asuras, broken by the god with the whirls of his sword, with arms and<br>thighs and chests cut off and pierced, and with heads severed from their<br>trunks, began to fall down on the earth. Others among the Danavas,<br>afflicted with strokes of the sword, broke and fled in all directions,<br>cheering one another as they fled. Some penetrated into the bowels of the<br>earth; others got under the cover of mountains, Some went upwards; others<br>entered the depths of the sea. During the progress of that dreadful and<br>fierce battle, the earth became miry with flesh and blood and horrible<br>sights presented themselves on every side. Strewn with the fallen bodies<br>of Danavas covered with blood, the earth looked as if overspread with<br>mountain summits overgrown with Kinsukas. Drenched with gore, the earth<br>looked exceedingly beautiful, like a fair-complexioned lady intoxicated<br>with alcohol and attired in crimson robes. Having slain the Danavas and<br>re-established Righteousness on earth, the auspicious Rudra cast off his<br>awful form and assumed his own beneficent shape. Then all the Rishis and<br>all the celestials adored that god of gods with loud acclamations wishing<br>him victory. The divine Rudra, after this, gave the sword, that protector<br>of religion, dyed with the blood of Danavas, unto Vishnu with due<br>adorations. Vishnu gave it unto Marichi. The divine Marichi gave it unto<br>all the great Rishis. The latter gave it to Vasava. Vasava gave it to the<br>Regents of the world. The Regents, O son, gave that large sword to Manu<br>the son of Surya. At the time, of giving it unto Manu, they said, 'Thou<br>art the lord of all men. Protect all creatures with this sword containing<br>religion within its womb. Duly meting out chastisement unto those that<br>have transgressed the barriers of virtue for the sake of the body or the<br>mind, they should be protected conformably to the ordinances but never<br>according to caprice. Some should be punished with wordy rebukes, and<br>with fines and forfeitures. Loss of limb or death should never be<br>inflicted for slight reasons. These punishments, consisting of wordy<br>rebukes as their first, are regarded as so many forms of the sword. These<br>are the shapes that the sword assumes in consequence of the<br>transgressions of persons under the protection (of the king).[481] In<br>time Manu installed his own son Kshupa in the sovereignty of all<br>creatures, and gave him the sword for their protection. From Kshupa it<br>was taken by Ikshvaku, and from Ikshvaku by Pururavas. From Pururavas it<br>was taken by Ayus, and from Ayus by Nahusha. From Nahusha it was taken by<br>Yayati, and from Yayati by Puru. From Puru it was taken by Amurtarya,<br>From Amurtarya it descended to the royal Bhumisaya. From Bhumisaya it was<br>taken by Dushmanta's son Bharata. From Bharata, O monarch, it was taken<br>by the righteous Ailavila. From Ailavila it was taken by king Dhundumara.<br>From Dhundumara it was taken by Kamvoja, and from Kamvoja it was taken by<br>Muchukunda, From Muchukunda it was taken by Marutta, and from Marutta by<br>Raivata. From Raivata it was taken by Yuvanaswa, and from Yuvanaswa by<br>Raghu. From Raghu it was taken by the valiant Harinaswa. From Harinaswa<br>the sword was taken by Sunaka and from Sunaka by the righteous-souled<br>Usinara. From the last it was taken by the Bhojas and the Yadavas. From<br>the Yadus it was taken by Sivi. From Sivi it descended to Pratardana.<br>From Pratardana it was received by Ashtaka, and from Ashtaka by<br>Prishadaswa. From Prishadaswa it was received by Bharadwaja, and from the<br>last by Drona. After Drona it was taken by Kripa. From Kripa that best of<br>swords has been obtained by thee with thy brothers. The constellation<br>under which the sword was born is Krittika. Agni is its deity, and Rohini<br>is its Gotra.[482] Rudra is its high preceptor. The sword has eight names<br>which are not generally known. Listen to me as I mention them to you. If<br>one mentions these, O son of Pandu, one may always win victory. Those<br>names then are Asi, Vaisasana, Khadga, sharp-edged, difficult of<br>acquisition, Sirgarbha, victory, and protector of righteousness. Of all<br>weapons, O son of Madravati, the sword is the foremost. The Puranas truly<br>declare that it was first wielded by Mahadeva. As regards the bow, again,<br>O chastiser of foes, it was Prithu who first created it. It was with the<br>aid of this weapon that that son of Vena, while he governed the earth<br>virtuously for many years, milked her of crops and grain in profusion. It<br>behoveth thee, O son of Madri, to regard what the Rishis have said, as<br>conclusive proof. All persons skilled in battle should worship the sword.<br>I have now told thee truly the first portion of thy query, in detail,<br>about the origin and creation of the sword, O bull of Bharata's race! By<br>listening to this excellent story of the origin of the sword, a man<br>succeeds in winning fame in this world and eternal felicity in the next.'"
