                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, O thou of virtuous soul, what, indeed,<br>is said to be productive of great merit[458] for a person attentively<br>engaged in the study of the Vedas and desirous of acquiring virtue? That<br>which is regarded in this world as productive of high merit is of diverse<br>kinds as set forth in the scriptures. Tell me, O grandsire, about that<br>which is regarded as such both here and hereafter. The path of duty is<br>long and has innumerable branches, O Bharata! Amongst those duties what<br>are those few that should, according to thee, be preferred to all others<br>for observance? Tell me, O king, in detail, about that which is so<br>comprehensive and which is so many-branched.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall speak to thee of that by which thou mayst attain<br>to high merit. Possessed as thou art of wisdom, thou shalt be gratified<br>with the knowledge. I will impart to thee, like a person gratified with<br>having quaffed nectar. The rules of duty that have been uttered by the<br>great Rishis, each relying upon his own wisdom, are many. The highest<br>among them all is self-restraint. Those amongst the ancients that were<br>acquainted with truth said that self-restraint leads to the highest<br>merit. As regards the Brahmana in particular, self-restraint is his<br>eternal duty. It is from self-restraint that he obtains the due fruition<br>of his acts. Self-restraint, in his case, surpasses (in merit) charity<br>and sacrifice and study of the Vedas. Self-restraint enhances (his)<br>energy. Self-restraint is highly sacred. Through self-restraint a man<br>becomes cleansed of all his sins and endued with energy, and as a<br>consequence, attains to the highest blessedness. We have not heard that<br>there is any other duty in all the worlds that can equal self-restraint.<br>Self-restraint, according to all virtuous persons, is the highest of<br>virtues in this world. Through self-restraint, O foremost of men, a<br>person acquires the highest happiness both here and hereafter. Endued<br>with self-restraint, one acquires great virtue. The self-restrained man<br>sleeps in felicity and awakes in felicity, and moves through the world in<br>felicity. His mind is always cheerful. The man who is without<br>self-restraint always suffers misery. Such a man brings upon himself many<br>calamities all born of his own faults. It has been said that in all the<br>four modes of life self-restraint is the best of vows. I shall now tell<br>thee those indications whose sum total is called self-restraint.<br>Forgiveness, patience, abstention from injury, impartiality, truth,<br>sincerity, conquest of the senses, cleverness, mildness, modesty,<br>steadiness, liberality, freedom from wrath, contentment, sweetness of<br>speech, benevolence, freedom from malice,&#8212;the union of all these is<br>self-restraint. It also consists, O son of Kuru, of veneration for the<br>preceptor and universal compassion. The self-restrained man avoids both<br>adulation and slander. Depravity, infamy, false speech, lust,<br>covetousness, pride, arrogance, self-glorification, fear, envy and<br>disrespect, ale all avoided by the self-restrained man. He never incurs<br>obloquy. He is free from envy. He is never gratified with small<br>acquisitions (in the form of earthly happiness of any kind.) He is even<br>like the ocean which can never be filled.[459] The man of self-restraint<br>is never bound by the attachments that arise from earthly connections<br>like to those involved in sentiments like these, 'I am thine, Thou art<br>thine, They are in me, and I am in them.' Such a man, who adopts the<br>practices of either cities or the woods, and who never indulges in<br>slander or adulation, attains to emancipation. Practising universal<br>friendliness, and possessed of virtuous behaviour, of cheerful soul and<br>endued with knowledge of soul, and liberated from the diverse attachments<br>of the earth, great is the reward that such a person obtains in the world<br>to me. Of excellent conduct and observant of duties, of cheerful soul and<br>possessed of learning and knowledge of self, such a man wins esteem while<br>here and attains to a high end hereafter. All acts that are regarded as<br>good on earth, all those acts that are practised by the righteous,<br>constitute the path of the ascetic possessed of knowledge. A person that<br>is good never deviates from that path. Retiring from the world and<br>betaking himself to a life in the woods, that learned person having a<br>complete control over the senses who treads in that path, in quiet<br>expectation of his decease, is sure to attain to the state of Brahma. He<br>who has no fear of any creature and of whom no creature is afraid, has,<br>after the dissolution of his body, no fear to encounter.[460] He who<br>exhausts his merits (by actual enjoyment) without seeking to store them<br>up, who casts an equal eye upon all creatures and practises a course of<br>universal friendliness, attains to Brahma. As the track of birds along<br>the sky or of fowl over the surface of water cannot be discerned, even so<br>the track of such a person (on earth) does not attract notice. For him, O<br>king, who abandoning home adopts the religion of emancipation, many<br>bright worlds wait to be enjoyed for eternity. If, abandoning all acts,<br>abandoning penances in due course, abandoning the diverse branches of<br>study, in fact, abandoning all things (upon which worldly men set their<br>hearts), one becomes pure in his desires, liberated from all<br>restraints,[461] of cheerful soul, conversant with self, and of pure<br>heart, one then wins esteem in this world and at last attains to heaven.<br>That eternal region of the Grandsire which springs from Vedic penances,<br>and which is concealed in a cave, can be won by only self-restraint.[462]<br>He who takes pleasure in true knowledge, who has become enlightened, and<br>who never injures any creature, has no fear of coming back to this world,<br>far less, any fear in respect of the others.[463] There is only one fault<br>in self-control. No second fault is noticeable in it. A person who has<br>self-control is regarded by men as weak and imbecile. O thou of great<br>wisdom, this attribute has only one fault. Its merits are many. By<br>forgiveness (which is only another form of self-control), the man of<br>self-control may easily acquire innumerable worlds. What need has a man<br>of self-control for a forest? Similarly, O Bharata, of what use is the<br>forest to him that has no self-control? That is a forest where the man of<br>self-control dwells, and that is even a sacred asylum.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of Bhishma, Yudhishthira<br>became highly gratified as if he had quaffed nectar. Again the king asked<br>that foremost of virtuous men. That perpetuator of Kuru's race<br>(questioned by his grandson) once more began to discourse cheerfully (on<br>the topic raised).'"
