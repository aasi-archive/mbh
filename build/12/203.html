                            "Manu said, 'The mind united with the senses, recollects after a long<br>time the impressions of the objects received in the past. When the senses<br>are all suspended (in respect of their functions),[675] the Supreme (the<br>Soul), in the form of the Understanding, exists in its own true nature.<br>When the Soul (at such a time) does not in the least regard all those<br>objects of the senses in respect of their simultaneity or the reverse in<br>point of time but mustering them from all directions holds them before it<br>together, it necessarily happens that he wanders among all things that<br>are incongruous. He is, therefore, the (silent) Witness. Hence the Soul<br>encased in body is something having a distinct and independent<br>existence.[676] There is Rajas, there is Tamas, and there is Sattwa, the<br>third. There are again three states of the understanding, viz., waking,<br>dreaming, and sound sleep. The Soul has knowledge of the pleasures and<br>pains, which are all contradictory, of those states, and which partake of<br>the nature of the threefold attributes first mentioned.[677] The Soul<br>enters the senses like the wind entering the fire in a piece of<br>wood.[678] One cannot behold the form of the Soul by one's eye, nor can<br>the sense of touch, amongst the senses, apprehend it. The Soul is not,<br>again, an object of apprehension by the ear. It may, however, be seen by<br>the aid of the Srutis and the instructions of the wise. As regards the<br>senses, that particular sense which apprehends it loses upon such<br>apprehension its existence as a sense.[679] The senses cannot themselves<br>apprehend their respective forms by themselves. The Soul is omniscient<br>(inasmuch as it apprehends both the knower and the known). It beholds all<br>things. Being omniscient, it is the Soul that beholds the senses<br>(without, as already said, the senses being able to apprehend it). Nobody<br>has seen the other side of the Himavat mountains, nor the reverse of the<br>moon's disc. Yet it cannot be said that these do not exist. Similarly,<br>though never apprehended by the senses, yet nobody can say that the Soul,<br>which dwells in all creatures, which is subtile, and which has knowledge<br>for its essence, does not exist. People see the world reflected on the<br>moon's disc in the form of spots. Though seeing, they do not know that it<br>is the world that is so reflected there. Even such is the knowledge of<br>the Soul. That knowledge must come of itself. The Soul depends upon the<br>Soul itself. Men of wisdom, reflecting on the formlessness of visible<br>objects before birth and after destruction, behold by the aid of<br>intelligence, the formlessness of objects that have apparent forms, So<br>also although the Sun's motion cannot be seen, yet persons, by watching<br>its rising and setting, conclude that the sun has motion.[680] Similarly,<br>those who are endued with wisdom and learning behold the Soul by the aid<br>of the lamp of intelligence, though it is at a great distance from them,<br>and seek to merge the fivefold elements, which are near, into<br>Brahma.[681] Verily, an object cannot be accomplished without the<br>application of means. Fishermen catch fish by means of nets made of<br>strings. Animals are captured by employing animals as are the means.<br>Birds are caught by employing birds as the means. Elephants are taken by<br>employing elephants. In this way, the Soul may be apprehended by the<br>principle of knowledge. We have heard that only a snake can see a snake's<br>legs. After the same manner one beholds, through Knowledge, the Soul<br>encased in subtile form and dwelling within the gross body. People<br>cannot, through their senses, know the senses. Similarly, mere<br>Intelligence at its highest cannot behold the Soul which is supreme. The<br>moon, on the fifteenth day of the dark fortnight, cannot be seen in<br>consequence of its form being hid. It cannot be said, however, that<br>destruction overtakes it, Even such is the case with the Soul dwelling in<br>the body. On the fifteenth day of the dark fortnight, the gross body of<br>the moon becomes invisible. After the same manner, the Soul, when<br>liberated from the body, cannot be apprehended. As the moon, gaining<br>another point in the firmament begins to shine once more, similarly, the<br>Soul obtaining a new body, begins to manifest itself once more. The<br>birth, growth and disappearance of the moon can all be directly<br>apprehended by the eye. These phenomena, however, appertain to the gross<br>form of that luminary. The like are not the attributes of the Soul. The<br>moon, when it shows itself after its disappearance on the fifteenth day<br>of the dark fortnight, is regarded as the same luminary that had become<br>invisible. After the same manner, notwithstanding the changes represented<br>by birth, growth and age, a person is regarded as the same individual<br>without any doubt of his identity. It cannot be distinctly seen how Rahu<br>approaches and leaves the moon. After the same manner, the Soul cannot be<br>seen how it leaves one body and enters another.[682] Rahu becomes visible<br>only when it exists with the sun or the moon. Similarly, the Soul becomes<br>an object of apprehension only when it exists with the body. When<br>liberated from the sun or the moon, Rahu can no longer be seen.<br>Similarly, the Soul, liberated from the body, can no longer be seen. Then<br>again, as the moon, even when it disappears on the fifteenth day of the<br>dark fortnight, is not deserted by the constellations and the stars, the<br>Soul also, even though separated from the body, is not deserted by the<br>fruits of the acts it has achieved in that body.'"
