                            Vaisampayana said, "Then Hrishikesa and king Yudhishthira, and all those<br>persons headed by Kripa, and the four Pandavas, riding on those cars<br>looking like fortified cities and decked with standards and banners,<br>speedily proceeded to Kurukshetra with the aid of their fleet steeds.<br>They descended on that field which was covered with hair and marrow and<br>bones and where millions of high-souled Kshatriyas had cast away their<br>bodies. It abounded also with many a hill formed of the bodies and bones<br>of elephants and steeds, and human heads and skulls lay stretched over it<br>like conch-shells. Variegated with thousands of funeral pyres and teeming<br>with heaps of armour and weapons, the vast plain looked like the drinking<br>garden of the Destroyer himself used and abandoned recently. The mighty<br>car-warriors quickly proceeded, viewing the field of battle haunted by<br>crowds of spirits and thronged with Rakshasas. While proceeding, the<br>mighty-armed Kesava, that delighter of all the Yadavas, spoke unto<br>Yudhishthira about the prowess of Jamadagni's son, 'Yonder, at a<br>distance, O Partha, are seen the five lakes of Rama! There Rama offered<br>oblations of Kshatriya blood unto the manes of his ancestors. It was<br>hither that the puissant Rama, having freed the earth of Kshatriya for<br>thrice seven times, gave up his task."<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'I have great doubts in what thou sayest about<br>Rama's having thrice seven times exterminated the Kshatriyas in days of<br>old. When the very Kshatriya seed was burnt by Rama, O bull among the<br>Yadus, how was the Kshatriya order revived, O thou of immeasurable<br>prowess? How, O bull of the Yadus, was the Kshatriya order exterminated<br>by the illustrious and high-souled Rama, and how did it again grow? In<br>frightful car-encounters millions of Kshatriyas were slain. The earth, O<br>foremost of eloquent men, was strewn with the corpses of Kshatriyas. For<br>what reason was the Kshatriya order thus exterminated in days of yore by<br>Rama, the high-souled descendant of Bhrigu, O tiger among the Yadus? O<br>thou of Vrishni's race, remove this doubt of mine, O bird-bannered hero!<br>O Krishna, O younger brother of Baladeva, the highest knowledge is from<br>thee.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"The puissant elder brother of Gada then narrated<br>unto Yudhishthira of incomparable prowess everything that happened, in<br>full detail, as to how the earth had become filled with Kshatriyas."
