                            "Bhishma said, 'Led into a spacious apartment, Gautama was introduced to<br>the king of the Rakshasas. Worshipped by the latter (with the usual<br>offerings), he took his seat on an excellent seat. The king asked him<br>about the race of his birth and his practices, his study of the Vedas and<br>his observance of the Brahmacharya vow. The Brahmana, however, without<br>answering the other queries, only stated his name and race. The king<br>having ascertained only the name and the race of his guest, and seeing<br>that he was destitute of Brahmanic splendour and Vedic studies, next<br>enquired about the country of his residence.'<br><br>"The Rakshasa said, 'Where is thy residence, O blessed one, and to what<br>race does thy wife belong? Tell us truly, do not fear. Trust us without<br>anxiety.'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'I belong by birth to the Middle country. I live in a<br>village of hunters. I have married a Sudra spouse who had been a widow.<br>All this that I tell you is the truth.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The king then began to reflect as to what he should<br>do. Indeed, the king began to think how he might succeed in acquiring<br>merit. He said unto himself. 'This man is by birth a, Brahmana. He is,<br>again a friend of the high-souled Rajadharman. He has been sent to me by<br>that son of Kasyapa. I must do what is agreeable to my friend. He is very<br>intimate with me. Indeed, he is my brother, and a dear relative. He is<br>truly a friend of my heart. On this day of the month of Kartika, a<br>thousand Brahmanas of the foremost order are to be entertained in my<br>house. This Gautama also shall be entertained with them and I shall give<br>wealth unto him too. This is a sacred day. Gautama has come hither as a<br>guest. The wealth that is to be given away (unto the Brahmanas) is ready.<br>What is there then to think of?' Just about this time a thousand<br>Brahmanas, possessed of great learning, with persons purified by baths<br>and adorned (with sandalpaste and flowers) and attired in long robes of<br>linen, came to the palace. The Rakshasa king Virupaksha, O monarch,<br>received the guests, as they came, duly and according to the rites laid<br>down in the scriptures. At the command of the king, skins were spread out<br>for them. The royal servants then, O best of the Bharatas, placed mats of<br>Kusa grass on the ground.[495] Those foremost of Brahmanas, having been<br>duly worshipped by the king sat down on those seats. The Rakshasa chief<br>once more worshipped his guests, as provided by the ordinance, with<br>sesame seeds, green blades of grass, and water. Some amongst them were<br>selected for representing the Viswedevas, the Pitris, and the deities of<br>fire. These were smeared with sandal-paste, and flowers were offered unto<br>them. They were also adored with other kinds of costly offerings. After<br>such worship, every one of them looked as effulgent as the moon in the<br>firmament. Then bright and polished plates of gold, adorned with<br>engravings, and filled with excellent food prepared with ghee and honey,<br>were given unto those Brahmanas. Every year (on the days of full moon) of<br>the months of Ashadha and Magha, a large number of Brahmanas used to<br>receive from the Rakshasa chief, after proper honours, the best kinds of<br>food that they desired. Especially, on the day of full moon in the month<br>of Kartika, after the expiry of autumn, the king used to give unto the<br>Brahmanas much wealth of diverse kinds, including gold, silver, jewels,<br>gems, pearls, diamonds of great value, stones of the lapis lazuli<br>variety, deer-skins, and skins of the Ranku deer. Indeed, O Bharata,<br>throwing a heap of wealth of many kinds for giving it away as Dakshina<br>(unto his regenerate guests), the mighty Virupaksha, addressing those<br>foremast of Brahmanas, said unto them, 'Take from these jewels and gems<br>as much as ye wish and can hope to bear away.' And he also used to say<br>unto them, O Bharata, these words: 'Taking those plates of gold and<br>vessels which you have used for your dinner, go ye away, O foremost of<br>Brahmanas.' When these words were uttered by the high-souled Rakshasa<br>king (on the occasion of that particular feast), those bulls among<br>Brahmanas took as much wealth as each desired. Worshipped with those<br>costly jewels and gems, those best of Brahmanas, attired in excellent<br>robes, became filled with delight. Once more, the Rakshasa king, having<br>restrained the Rakshasas that had come to his palace from diverse lands,<br>addressed those Brahmanas and said, 'This one day, ye regenerate ones, ye<br>need have no fear from the Rakshasas here. Sport ye as ye wish, and then<br>go away with speed.' The Brahmanas then, leaving that spot, went away in<br>all directions with great speed. Gautama also, having taken up a heavy<br>quantity of gold without any loss of time, went away. Carrying the<br>burthen with difficulty, he reached that same banian (under which he had<br>met the crane). He sat himself down, fatigued, toil worn, and hungry.<br>While Gautama was resting there, that best of birds viz., Rajadharman, O<br>king, came there. Devoted to friends, he gladdened Gautama by bidding him<br>welcome. By flapping his wings he began to fan his guest and dispel his<br>fatigue. Possessed of great intelligence, he worshipped Gautama, and made<br>arrangements for his food. Having eaten and refreshed himself, Gautama<br>began to think, 'Heavy is this load that I have taken of bright gold,<br>moved by covetousness and folly. I have a long way to travel. I have no<br>food by which to support life on my way. What should I do for supporting<br>life?' Even these were his thoughts then. It so happened that even upon<br>much thinking he failed to see any food which he could eat on the way.<br>Ungrateful as he was, O tiger among men, even this was the thought that<br>he then conceived, 'This prince of cranes, so large and containing a heap<br>of flesh, stayeth by my side. Staying and bagging him, I shall leave this<br>spot and go along with great speed.'"
