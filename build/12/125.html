                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast said, O grandsire, that behaviour is the<br>first (of requisites for a man). Whence, however, does Hope arise? Tell<br>me what it is. This great doubt has taken possession of my mind. There is<br>no other person than thee, O subjugator of hostile towns, who can remove<br>it. O grandsire, I had great hope in respect of Suyodhana that when, a<br>battle was about to ensue (in consequence of his own obstinacy), he<br>would, O lord, do what was proper. In every man hope is great. When that<br>hope is destroyed, great is the grief that succeeds, and which, without<br>doubt, is equal to almost death itself. Fool that I am, Dhritarashtra's<br>wicked-souled son, Duryodhana, destroyed the hope I had cherished.<br>Behold, O king, the foolishness of my mind! I think that hope is vaster<br>than a mountain with all its trees. Or, perhaps, it is vaster than the<br>firmament itself. Or, perhaps, O king, it is really immeasurable. Hope, O<br>chief of the Kurus, is exceedingly difficult of being understood and<br>equally difficult of being subdued. Beholding this last attribute of<br>Hope, I ask, what else is so unconquerable as this?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall narrate to thee, O Yudhishthira, in this<br>connection, the discourse between Sumitra and Rishabha that took place in<br>olden times. Listen to it. A royal sage of the Haihaya race, Sumitra by<br>name, went out a hunting. He pursued a deer, having pierced it with a<br>straight shaft. Possessed of great strength, the deer ran ahead, with the<br>arrow sticking to him. The king was possessed of great strength, and<br>accordingly pursued with great speed his prey. The animal, endued with<br>fleetness, quickly cleared a low ground and then a level plain. The king,<br>young, active and strong, and armed with bow and sword and cased in mail,<br>still pursued it. Unaccompanied by anybody, in chasing the animal through<br>the forest the king crossed many rivers and streams and lakes and copses.<br>Endued with great speed, the animal, at its will, showing itself now and<br>then to the king, ran on with great speed. Pierced with many shafts by<br>the king, that denizen of wilderness, O monarch, as if in sport,<br>repeatedly lessened the distance between itself and the pursuer.<br>Repeatedly putting forth its speed and traversing one forest after<br>another, it now and then showed itself to the king at a near point. At<br>last that crusher of foes, taking a very superior shaft, sharp, terrible,<br>and capable of penetrating into the very vitals, fixed it on his<br>bowstring. The animal then, of huge proportions, as if laughing at the<br>pursuer's efforts suddenly distanced him by reaching a point full four<br>miles ahead of the range of the shaft. That arrow of blazing splendour<br>accordingly fell on the ground. The deer entered a large forest but the<br>king still continued the chase.'"
