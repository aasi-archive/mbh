                            "Janamejaya said, 'When that tiger among men, of righteous soul and great<br>energy, firmly adhering to truth and with passions under complete<br>control, viz., the son of Santanu and Ganga, named Devavrata or Bhishma<br>of unfading glory, lay on a hero's bed with the sons of Pandu sitting<br>around him, tell me, O great sage, what converse ensued in that meeting<br>of heroes after the slaughter of the troops.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'When Bhishma that chief of the Kurus, lay on his bed<br>of arrows, many Rishis and Siddhas, O king, headed by Narada, came to<br>that spot. The unslain remnant of the (assembled) kings with Yudhishthira<br>at their head, and Dhritarashtra and Krishna and Bhima and Arjuna and the<br>twins also came there. Those high-souled persons, approaching the<br>grandsire of the Bharatas who looked like the Sun himself dropped from<br>the firmament, indulged in lamentations for him. Then Narada of godlike<br>features reflecting for a short while, addressed all the Pandavas and the<br>unslain remnant of the kings saying, 'The time, I think, has come for you<br>to question Bhishma (on subject of morality and religion), for Ganga's<br>son is about to expire like the Sun that is on the point of setting. He<br>is about to cast off his life-breaths. Do you all, therefore, solicit him<br>to discourse to you? He is acquainted with the varied duties of all the<br>four orders. Old in years, after abandoning his body he will obtain high<br>regions of bliss. Solicit him, therefore, without delay, to clear the<br>doubts that exists in your minds.' Thus addressed by Narada, those<br>princes approached Bhishma, but unable to ask him anything, looked at one<br>another. Then Yudhishthira the son of Pandu, addressing Hrishikesa said,<br>"There is no one else than Devaki's son that can question the grandsire.<br>O foremost one of Yadu's race, do thou, therefore, O slayer of Madhu,<br>speak first. Thou, O sire, art the foremost of us all and thou art<br>conversant with every duty and practice." Thus addressed by the son of<br>Pandu, the illustrious Kesava of unfading glory, approaching the<br>unconquerable Bhishma, spoke unto him as follows.'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'Hast thou, O best of kings, passed the night happily?<br>Has thy understanding become unclouded? Does thy knowledge, O sinless<br>one, shine in thee by inward light? I hope thy heart no longer feels pain<br>and thy mind is no longer agitated.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Burning, stupefaction, fatigue, exhaustion, illness, and<br>pain, through thy grace, O thou of Vrishni's race, have all left me in a<br>single day. O thou of incomparable splendour, all that is past, all that<br>is future, and all that is present, I behold as clearly as a fruit placed<br>in my hands. All the duties declared in the Vedas, all those laid down in<br>the Vedantas, I behold clearly, O thou of unfading glory, in consequence<br>of the boon thou hast granted to me. The duties that have been declared<br>by persons of learning and righteous behaviour, dwell in my remembrance.<br>I am conversant also, O Janardana, with the duties and practices<br>prevailing in particular countries and among particular tribes and<br>families. Everything relating again to the four modes of life has come<br>back to my recollection. I am acquainted also, O Kesava, with the duties<br>that relate to king-craft. Whatever should at whatever time be said, I<br>would say, O Janardana! Through thy grace, I have acquired an auspicious<br>understanding. Strengthened by meditation on thee, feel as if I have<br>become a young man again. Through thy favour, O Janardana, I have become<br>competent to discourse on what is beneficial (for the world). Why,<br>however, O holy one, dost thou not thyself discourse to Pandu's son upon<br>all that is good? What explanation hast thou to give in respect of this?<br>Tell me quickly, O Madhava!'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'Know, O thou of Kuru's race, that I am the root of fame<br>and of everything that leads to good. All things, good or bad, proceed<br>from me. Who on earth will wonder if the moon be said to be of cool rays?<br>Similarly, who will wonder if I were described as one possessed of the<br>full measure of fame?[159] I have, however, resolved to enhance thy fame,<br>O thou of great splendour! It is for this, O Bhishma, that I have just<br>inspired thee with great intelligence. As long, O lord of earth, as the<br>earth will last, so long will thy fame travel with undiminished lustre<br>through all the worlds. Whatever, O Bhishma, thou wilt say unto the<br>inquiring son of Pandu, will be regarded on earth to be as authoritative<br>as the declarations of that Vedas. That person who will conduct himself<br>here according to the authority of thy declarations, will obtain<br>hereafter the reward of every meritorious act. For this reason, O<br>Bhishma, I have imparted to thee celestial understanding so that thy fame<br>maybe enhanced on earth. As long as a man's fame lasts in the world, so<br>long are his achievements said to live. The unslain remnant of the<br>(assembled) kings are sitting around thee, desirous of listening to thy<br>discourses on morality and duty. Do thou speak unto them, O Bharata! Thou<br>art old in years and thy behaviour is consistent with the ordinance of<br>the Srutis. Thou art well conversant with the duties of kings and with<br>every other science of duty. No one has ever noticed the slightest<br>transgression in thee from thy every birth. All the kings know thee to be<br>conversant with all the sciences of morality and duty. Like a sire unto<br>his sons do thou, therefore, O king, discourse unto them of high<br>morality. Thou hast always worshipped the Rishis and the gods. It is<br>obligatory on thee to discourse on these subjects in detail unto persons<br>desirous of listening to discourse on morality and duty. A learned<br>person, especially when solicited by the righteous, should discourse on<br>the same. The sages have declared this to be a duty. O puissant one, if<br>thou dost not speak on such subjects, thou wilt incur sin. Therefore,<br>questioned by thy sons and grandsons, O learned one, about the eternal<br>duties (of men), do thou, O bull among the Bharatas, discourse upon them<br>on the subject.'"
