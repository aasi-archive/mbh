                            "Vyasa said, 'One should not show any affection for scents and tastes and<br>other kinds of enjoyment. Nor should one accept ornaments and other<br>articles contributing to the enjoyment of the senses of scent and taste.<br>One should not covet honour and achievements and fame. Even this is the<br>behaviour of a Brahmana possessed of vision.[1068] He that hath studied<br>all the Vedas, having waited dutifully on his preceptor and observed the<br>vow of Brahmacharya, he that knows all the Richs, Yajuses, and Samans, is<br>not a regenerate person.[1069] One that behaves towards all creatures as<br>if one is their kinsman, and one that is acquainted with Brahma, is said<br>to be conversant with all the Vedas. One that is divested of desire<br>(being contented with knowledge of the Soul), never dies. It is by such a<br>behaviour and such a frame of mind that one becomes a truly regenerate<br>person.[1070] Having performed only various kinds of religious rites and<br>diverse sacrifices completed with gift of Dakshina, one does not acquire<br>the status of a Brahmana if he is devoid of compassion and hath not given<br>up desire.[1071] When one ceases to fear all creatures and when all<br>creatures cease to fear one, when one never desires for anything nor<br>cherishes aversion for anything, then he is said to attain to the status<br>of Brahma. When one abstains from injuring all creatures in thought,<br>speech, and act, then he is said to acquire the status of Brahma. There<br>is only one kind of bondage in this world, viz., the bondage of desire,<br>and no other. One that is freed from the bondage of desire attains to the<br>status of Brahma. Freed from desire like the Moon emerged from murky<br>clouds, the man of wisdom, purged of all stains, lives in patient<br>expectation of his time. That person into whose mind all sorts of desire<br>enter like diverse streams falling into the ocean without being able to<br>enhance its limits by their discharge, succeeds in obtaining<br>tranquillity, but not he who cherishes desire for all earthly objects.<br>Such a person becomes happy in consequence of the fruition of all his<br>wishes, and not he who cherishes desire for earthly objects. The latter,<br>even if he attains to heaven, has to fall away from it.[1072] The Vedas<br>have truth for their recondite object. Truth hath the subjugation of the<br>senses for its recondite object. The subjugation of the senses hath<br>charity for its recondite object. Charity hath penance for its recondite<br>object. Penance hath renunciation for its recondite object. Renunciation<br>hath happiness for its recondite object. Happiness hath heaven for its<br>recondite object. Heaven hath tranquillity for its recondite<br>object.[1073] For the sake of contentment thou shouldst wish to obtain a<br>serene understanding which is a precious possession, being indicative of<br>Emancipation, and which, scorching grief and all purposes or doubts<br>together with thirst, destroys them completely in the end.[1074] One<br>possessed of those six attributes, viz., contentment, grieflessness,<br>freedom from attachment, peacefulness, cheerfulness, and freedom from<br>envy, is sure to become full or complete.[1075] They that, transcending<br>all consciousness of body, know the Soul which resides within the body<br>and which is understood by only persons of wisdom with the aid of the six<br>entities (already mentioned, viz., the Vedas and truth, etc.) when<br>endowed with only the attribute of Sattwa, and with the aid also of the<br>other three (viz., instruction, meditation and Yoga), succeed in<br>attaining to Emancipation.[1076] The man of wisdom, by understanding the<br>Soul which presides within the body, which is divested of the attributes<br>of birth and death, which exists in its own nature, which being<br>uninvested with attributes requires no act of purification, and which is<br>identical with Brahma, enjoys beatitude that knows no termination. The<br>gratification that the man of wisdom obtains by restraining his mind from<br>wandering in all directions and fixing it wholly on the Soul is such that<br>its like cannot be attained by one through any other means. He is said to<br>be truly conversant with the Vedas who is conversant with that which<br>gratifies one whose stomach is empty, which pleases one who is indigent,<br>and which invigorates one whose limbs are dry. Suspending his senses that<br>have been duly restrained from unworthy indulgence, he who lives engaged<br>in Yoga meditation, is said to be a Brahmana. Such a person is said to be<br>distinguished above others. Such a person is said to derive his joys from<br>the Soul. With reference to one who lives after having weakened desire<br>and devoting himself to the highest topic of existence, it should be said<br>that his happiness is continuously enhanced like the lunar disc (in the<br>lighted fortnight).[1077] Like the Sun dispelling darkness, felicity<br>dispels the sorrows of that Yogin who transcends both the gross and the<br>subtile elements, as also Mahat and the Unmanifest.[1078] Decrepitude and<br>death cannot assail that Brahmana who has got beyond the sphere of acts,<br>who has transcended the destruction of the Gunas themselves, and who is<br>no longer attached to worldly objects.[1079] Indeed, when the Yogin,<br>freed from everything, lives in a state transcending both attachment and<br>aversion, he is said to transcend even in this life his senses and all<br>their objects. That Yogin, who having transcended Prakriti attains to the<br>Highest Cause, becomes freed from the obligation of a return to the world<br>in consequence of his having attained to that which is the<br>highest.'"[1080]
