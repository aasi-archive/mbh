                            "Bhishma said, 'Hearing these words of their preceptor, Vyasa's disciples<br>endued with energy, became filled with joy and embraced one another.<br>Addressing one another, they said,&#8212;That which has been said by our<br>illustrious preceptor in view of our future good, will live in our<br>remembrance and we shall certainly act according to it.&#8212;Having said this<br>unto one another with joyful hearts, the disciples of Vyasa, who were<br>thorough masters of words, once more addressed their preceptor and<br>said,&#8212;If it pleases thee, O puissant one, we wish to descend from this<br>mountain to the Earth, O great ascetic, for the purpose of subdividing<br>the Vedas!&#8212;Hearing these words of his disciples, the puissant son of<br>Parasara replied unto them in these beneficial words that were fraught,<br>besides, with righteousness and profit,&#8212;You may repair to the Earth or<br>to the regions of the celestials, as ye like. You should always be<br>heedful, for the Vedas are such that they are always liable to be<br>misunderstood![1750]&#8212;Permitted by their preceptor of truthful speech,<br>the disciples left him after circumambulating him and bowing their heads<br>unto him. Descending upon the Earth they performed the Agnishtoma and<br>other sacrifices; and they began to officiate at the sacrifices of<br>Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaidyas. Happily passing their days in the<br>domestic mode of life, they were treated by the Brahmanas with great<br>respect. Possessed of great fame and prosperity, they were employed in<br>teaching and officiating in sacrifices. After his disciples had gone<br>away, Vyasa remained in his asylum, with only his son in his company.<br>Passing his days in anxious thoughtfulness, the great Rishi, possessed of<br>wisdom, kept silent, sitting in a retired corner of the asylum. At that<br>time Narada of great ascetic merit came to that spot for seeing Vyasa,<br>and addressing him, said these words of melodious sound.<br><br>"'Narada said, O regenerate Rishi of Vasishtha's race, why are Vedic<br>sounds silent now? Why art thou sitting silent and alone engaged in<br>meditation like one taken up with an engrossing thought? Alas, shorn of<br>Vedic echoes, this mountain hath lost its beauty, even as the Moon shorn<br>of splendour when assailed by Rahu or enveloped in dust.[1751] Though<br>inhabited by the celestial Rishis, yet shorn of Vedic sounds, the<br>mountain no longer looks beautiful now but resembles a hamlet of<br>Nishadas.[1752] The Rishis, the deities, and the Gandharvas, too, no<br>longer shine as before in consequence of being deprived of Vedic<br>sound!&#8212;Hearing these words of Narada, the Island-born Krishna answered,<br>saying,&#8212;O great Rishi, O thou art conversant with the declarations of<br>the Vedas, all that thou hast said is agreeable to me and it truly<br>behoves thee to say it unto me! Thou omniscient, thou hast seen<br>everything. Thy curiosity also embraces all things within its sphere. All<br>that has ever occurred in the three worlds is well known to thee. Do thou<br>then, O regenerate Rishi, set thy commands on me. O, tell me what I am to<br>do! Tell me, O regenerate Rishi, what should now be done by me. Separated<br>from my disciples, my mind has become very cheerless now.<br><br>'Narada said, The stain of the Vedas is the suspension of their<br>recitation. The stain of the Brahmanas is their non-observance of vows.<br>The Valhika race is the stain of the Earth. Curiosity is the stain of<br>women. Do thou with thy intelligent son recite the Vedas, and do thou<br>with the echoes of Vedic sounds dispel the fears arising from Rakshasas:<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Hearing these words of Narada, Vyasa, the foremost<br>of all persons conversant with duties and firmly devoted to Vedic<br>recitation, became filled with joy and answered Narada, saying,&#8212;So be<br>it&#8212;With his son Suka, he set himself to recite the Vedas in a loud<br>sonorous voice, observing all the rules of orthoepy and, as it were,<br>filling the three worlds with that sound. One day as sire and son, who<br>were well-conversant with all duties, were engaged in reciting the Vedas,<br>a violent wind arose that seemed to be impelled by the gales that blow on<br>the bosom of the ocean. Understanding from this circumstance that the<br>hour was suited to sacred recitation. Vyasa immediately bade his son to<br>suspend the recitation. Suka, thus forbidden by his sire, became filled<br>with curiosity. He asked his sire, saying,&#8212;O regenerate one, whence is<br>this wind? It behoveth thee to tell me everything about the conduct of<br>the Wind.&#8212;Hearing this question of Suka, Vyasa became filled with<br>amazement. He answered Suka, by telling him that an omen which indicated<br>that the recitation of the Vedas should be suspended.&#8212;Thou hast obtained<br>spiritual vision. Thy mind too has, of itself, become cleansed of every<br>impurity. Thus hast been freed from the attributes of Passion and<br>Darkness. Thou stayest now in the attributes of Goodness. Thou beholdest<br>now thy Soul with thy Soul even as one beholds one's own shadow in a<br>mirror. Staying thyself on thy own Soul, do thou reflect on the Vedas.<br>The path of the Supreme Soul is called Deva-yana (the path of the gods).<br>The path that is made up of the attribute of Tamas is called Pitri-yana<br>(the path of Pitris). These are the two paths in the world hereafter. By<br>one, people go to heaven. By the other, people go to hell. The winds blow<br>on the Earth's surface and in the welkin. There are seven courses in<br>which they blow. Listen to me as I recount them one after another. The<br>body is furnished with the senses are dominated over by the Sadhyas and<br>many great beings of mighty strength. These gave birth to an invincible<br>son named Samana. From Samana sprang a son called Udana. From Udana<br>sprang Vyana arose Apana, and lastly from Apana sprung the wind called<br>Prana. That invincible scorcher of all foes, viz., Prana, became<br>childless. I shall now recite to thee the different functions of those<br>winds. The wind is the cause of the different functions of all living<br>creatures, and because living creatures are enabled to live by it,<br>therefore is the wind called Prana (or life). That wind which is the<br>first in the above enumeration and which is known by the name of Pravaha<br>(Samana) urges, along the first course, masses of clouds born of smoke<br>and heat. Coursing through the welkin, and coming into contact with the<br>water contained in the clouds, that wind displays itself in effulgence<br>among the darts of lightning.[1753] The second wind called Avaha blows<br>with a loud noise. It is this wind that causes Soma and the other<br>luminaries to rise and appear. Within the body (which is a microcosm of<br>the universe) that wind is called Udana by the wise. That wind which<br>sucks up water from the four oceans, and having sucked it up imparts it<br>to the clouds in the welkin, and which, having imparted it to the clouds<br>present them to the deity of rain, is third in the enumeration and known<br>by the name of Udvaha. That wind which supports the clouds and divided<br>them into diverse portions, which melts them for pouring rain and once<br>more solidifies them, which is perceived as the sound of the roaring<br>clouds, which exists for the preservation of the world by itself assuming<br>the form of the clouds, which bears the cars of all celestial beings<br>along the sky, is known by the name of Samvaha. The fourth in the<br>enumeration, it is endued with great strength so that it is capable of<br>ending the very mountains. The fifth wind is fraught with great force and<br>speed. It is dry and uproots and breaks down all trees. Existing with it,<br>the clouds come to be called by the name of Valahaka. That wind causes<br>calamitous phenomena of many kinds, and produces roaring sounds in the<br>firmament. It is known by the name of Vivaha. The sixth wind bears all<br>celestial waters in the firmament and prevents them from falling down.<br>Sustaining the sacred waters of the celestial Ganga, that wind blows,<br>preventing them from having a downward course. Obstructed by that wind<br>from a distance, the Sun, which is really the source of a thousand rays,<br>and which enlightens the world, appears as a luminous body of but one<br>ray. Through the action of that wind, the Moon, after waning, wanes again<br>till he displays his full disc. That wind is known, O foremost of<br>ascetics, by the name Parivaha.[1754] That wind which takes away the life<br>of all living creatures when the proper hour comes, whose track is<br>followed by Death and Surya's son Yama, which becomes the source of that<br>immortality which is attained by Yogins of subtile sight who are always<br>engaged in Yoga meditation, by whose aid the thousands of grandsons of<br>Daksha, that lord of creatures, by his ten sons, succeeded in days of old<br>in attaining to the ends of the universe, whose touch enables one to<br>attain to Emancipation by freeing oneself from the obligation of<br>returning so the world,&#8212;that wind is called by the name of Paravaha. The<br>foremost of all winds, it is incapable of being resisted by anybody.<br>Wonderful are these winds all of whom are the sons of Diti. Capable of<br>going everywhere and upholding all things, they blow all around thee<br>without being attached to thee at any time. This, however, is exceedingly<br>wonderful viz., that this foremost of mountains should thus be suddenly<br>shaken by that wind which has begun to blow. This wind is the breath of<br>Vishnu's nostrils. When urged forth with speed, it begins to blow with<br>great force at which the whole universe becomes agitated. Hence, when the<br>wind begins to blow with violence, persons conversant with the Vedas do<br>not recite the Vedas. The Vedas are a form of wind. If uttered with<br>force, the external wind becomes tortured."<br><br>"Having said these words, the puissant son of Parasara bade his son (when<br>the wind had ceased) to go on with his Vedic recitation. He then left<br>that spot for plunging into the waters of the celestial Ganga.'"[1755]
