                            "Yudhishthira said, 'How did the son of Srinjaya become<br>Suvarnashthivin?[103] Why also did Parvata give Srinjaya that child? And<br>why did he die? When the lives of all men in those days extended for a<br>thousand years, why did Srinjaya's son die in infancy? Or, was he in name<br>only Suvarnashthivin? How also did he come to be so? I desire to know all<br>this.'<br><br>"Krishna said, "I will recite to thee, O king, the facts as they<br>happened. There are two Rishis, the foremost ones in the world, named<br>Narada and Parvata. Narada is the maternal uncle and Parvata is his<br>sister's son. With cheerful hearts, the uncle Narada and the nephew<br>Parvata had, in days of old, O king, left heaven for a pleasant ramble on<br>earth for tasting clarified butter and rice. Both of them, possessed of<br>great ascetic merit, wandered over the earth, subsisting on food taken by<br>human beings. Filled with joy and entertaining great affection for each<br>other, they entered into a compact that, whatever wish, good or bad,<br>would be entertained by one should be disclosed to the other, but on the<br>event of one of them acting otherwise, he should be subject to the<br>other's curse. Agreeing to that understanding, those two great Rishis,<br>adored of all the worlds, repaired to king Srinjaya, the son of Sitya and<br>said unto him, 'We two, for thy good, shall dwell with thee for a few<br>days. O lord of earth, do thou attend to all our wants duly.' The king,<br>saying, So be it, set himself to attend upon them hospitably. After a<br>while, one day, the king filled with joy, introduced to those illustrious<br>ascetics his daughter of the fairest complexion, saying, 'This my<br>daughter will wait upon you both. Bright as the filaments of the lotus,<br>she is beautiful and of faultless limbs, accomplished and of sweet<br>manners, and is called Sukumari by name.' 'Very well,' said the Rishis in<br>reply, upon which the king directed his daughter, telling her, 'O child,<br>attend upon these two Brahmanas as thou wouldst upon the gods or thy<br>sire.' The virtuous princess, saying, 'So be it' began to attend upon<br>them in obedience to her father's behest. Her dutiful services and her<br>unrivalled beauty very soon inspired Narada with a tender flame towards<br>her. That tender sentiment began to grow in the heart of the illustrious<br>saint like the moon gradually waxing on the accession of the lighted<br>fortnight. The virtuous Narada, however, overwhelmed by shame, could not<br>disclose that burning attachment to his sister's son, the high-souled<br>Parvata. By his ascetic power, as also by signs, Parvata understood all.<br>Inflamed with rage, the latter thereupon resolved to curse the<br>love-afflicted Narada. And he said, 'Having of thy own accord made a<br>compact with me that, whatever wish, good or bad, would be cherished by<br>either of us should be disclosed to the other, thou hast violated it.<br>These were thy own words. O Brahmana! It is for this that I shall curse<br>thee. Thou didst not tell me before that thy heart has been pierced by<br>the charms of the maiden Sukumari! It is for this that I shall curse<br>thee. Thou art a Brahmacharin. Thou art my preceptor. Thou art an ascetic<br>and a Brahmana. Yet hast thou broken the compact thou hadst made with me.<br>Fitted with rage I shall, for this, curse even thee. Listen to me. This<br>Sukumari shall, without doubt, become thy wife. From the time of thy<br>marriage, however, O puissant one, both she and all men shall behold thee<br>an ape, for thy true features having disappeared, an ape shalt thou<br>appear unto all.' Hearing these words of his, the uncle Narada, filled<br>with wrath, cursed his nephew Parvata in return, saying, 'Although thou<br>hast ascetic merit and Brahmacharya and truth and self-restraint, and<br>although thou art ever devoted to virtue, thou shalt not yet succeed in<br>proceeding to heaven.' Filled with rage and desire of vengeance, they<br>thus cursed and flamed against each other like a couple of infuriated<br>elephants. From that time the high-souled Parvata began to wander over<br>the earth, respected as he deserved, O Bharata, for his own energy.<br>Narada then, that foremost of Brahmanas, obtained according to due rites<br>the hand of Srinjaya's daughter, the faultless Sukumari. The princess,<br>however, beheld Narada exactly as the curse had said. Indeed, just after<br>the last of the wedding mantras had been recited, Sukumari beheld the<br>celestial Rishi to have a face like that of an ape. She, however, did not<br>on that account, disregard her lord. On the other hand, she dedicated her<br>love to him. Indeed, the princess, chaste as she was, devoted herself<br>entirely to her lord and did not in her heart even desire any one else<br>among the gods, Munis, and Yakshas for a husband. One day, as the<br>illustrious Parvata, in course of his wanderings, entered a solitary<br>forest, he beheld Narada there. Saluting him, Parvata said, 'Show thy<br>grace unto me by permitting me, O puissant one, to co to heaven.' Seeing<br>the cheerless Parvata kneeling before him with joined hands, Narada,<br>himself mere cheerless, said unto him, 'Thou hadst cursed me first,<br>saying, 'Be thou an ape!' After thou hadst said so unto me, I cursed thee<br>from anger, saying, 'From this day thou shalt not dwell in heaven!' It<br>was not well of thee, since thou art like a son unto me.' The two saints<br>then freed each other from their mutual curses. Beholding her husband<br>possessed of celestial form and blazing with beauty, Sukumari fled from<br>him, taking him to be somebody other than her lord. Seeing the beautiful<br>princess flying away from her lord, Parvata addressed her, saying, 'This<br>one is even thy husband. Do not entertain any scruple. This one is the<br>illustrious and puissant Rishi Narada, that foremost of virtuous persons.<br>He is thy lord, of one soul with thee. Do not have any doubt.' Assured in<br>diverse ways by the high Parvata and formed also of the curse on her<br>lord, the princess regained her equanimity. Then Parvata proceeded to<br>heaven and Narada to his home."<br><br>"Vasudeva continued, 'The illustrious Rishi Narada, who was himself an<br>actor in this matter, is here. O best of men, asked by thee, he will tell<br>thee everything that happened.'"
