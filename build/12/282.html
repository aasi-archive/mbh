                            "Bhishma said, 'Listen, O king, to me as I tell thee the symptoms that<br>appeared on the body of Vritra when he was overtaken by that fever (born<br>of the energy of Mahadeva). The heroic Asura's mouth began to emit flames<br>of fire. He became exceedingly pale. His body began to tremble all over.<br>His breath became hard and thick. His hairs stood on end. His memory, O<br>Bharata, issued out of his mouth in the form of a fierce, dreadful, and<br>inauspicious jackal. Burning and blazing meteors fell on his right and<br>left. Vultures and kanakas and cranes, gathering together, uttered fierce<br>cries, as they wheeled over Vritra's head. Then, in that encounter,<br>Indra, adored by the gods, and armed with the thunderbolt, looked hard at<br>the Daitya as the latter sat on his car. Possessed by that violent fever,<br>the mighty Asura, O monarch, yawned and uttered inhuman cries.[1394]<br>While the Asura was yawning Indra hurled his thunderbolt at him. Endued<br>with exceedingly great energy and resembling the fire that destroys the<br>creation at the end of the Yuga, that thunderbolt overthrew in a trice<br>Vritra of gigantic form. Loud shouts were once more uttered by the gods<br>on all sides when they beheld Vritra slain, O bull of Bharata's race!<br>Having slain Vritra, Maghavat, that foe of the Danavas, possessed of<br>great fame, entered heaven with that thunderbolt pervaded by Vishnu. Just<br>then, O thou of Kuru's race, the sin of Brahmanicide (in her embodied<br>form), fierce and awful and inspiring all the worlds with dread, issued<br>out of the body of the slain Vritra. Of terrible teeth and awful, hideous<br>for ugliness, and dark and tawny, with hair dishevelled, and dreadful<br>eyes, O Bharata, with a garland of skulls round her neck, and looking<br>like an (Atharvan) Incantation (in its embodied form), O bull of<br>Bharata's race, covered all over with blood, and clad in rags and barks<br>of trees, O thou of righteous soul, she came out of Vritra's body. Of<br>such dreadful form and mien, O monarch, she sought the wielder of the<br>thunderbolt (for possessing him). A little while after, O thou of Kuru's<br>race, the slayer of Vritra, on some purpose connected with the good of<br>the three worlds, was proceeding towards heaven. Beholding Indra of great<br>energy thus proceeding on his mission, she seized the chief of the<br>deities and from that moment stuck to him.[1395] When the sin of<br>Brahmanicide thus stuck to his person and inspired him with terror, Indra<br>entered the fibres of a lotus-stalk and dwelt there for many long years.<br>But the sin of Brahmanicide pursued him closely. Indeed, O son of Kuru,<br>seized by her, Indra became deprived of all his energies. He made great<br>efforts for driving her from him, but all those efforts proved abortive.<br>Seized by her, O bull of Bharata's race, the chief of the deities at last<br>presented himself before the Grandsire and worshipped him by bending his<br>head low. Understanding that Sakra was possessed by the sin of<br>Brahmanicide,[1396] Brahman began to reflect, O best of the Bharatas,<br>(upon the means of freeing his suppliant). The grandsire at last, O thou<br>of mighty arms, addressed Brahmanicide in a sweet voice as if from the<br>desire of pacifying her, and said, 'O amiable one, let the chief of the<br>celestials, who is a favourite of mine, be freed from thee. Tell me, what<br>I shall do for thee. What wish of thine shall I accomplish?'<br><br>"Brahmanicide said, 'When the Creator of the three worlds, when the<br>illustrious god adored by the universe, hath been pleased with me, I<br>regard my wishes as already accomplished. Let my residence be now<br>appointed. Desirous of preserving the worlds, this rule had been made by<br>thee. It was thou, O lord, that didst introduced this important<br>ordinance.[1397] As thou hast been gratified with me, O righteous Lord, O<br>puissant Master of all the worlds, I shall certainly leave Sakra! But<br>grant me an abode to dwell in.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The Grandsire replied unto Brahmanicide, saying, 'So<br>be it!' Indeed, the Grandsire discovered means for dispelling<br>Brahmanicide from the person of Indra. The Self-create recollected the<br>high-souled Agni. The latter immediately presented himself to Brahman and<br>said these words, 'O illustrious and divine Lord, O thou that are without<br>any defect, I have appeared before thee. It behoveth thee to say what I<br>shall have to accomplish.'<br><br>"Brahman said, 'I shall divide this sin of Brahmanicide into several<br>portions. For freeing Sakra from her, do thou take a fourth portion of<br>that sin.'<br><br>"Agni said, 'How shall I be rescued from her, O Brahman? O puissant Lord,<br>do thou appoint the way. I desire to know the means (of my own rescue) in<br>detail, O adored of all the worlds!'<br><br>"Brahman said, 'Unto that man who, overwhelmed by the quality of Tamas,<br>will abstain from offering thee as an oblation, when he beholds thee in<br>thy blazing form, seeds, herbs, and juices, that portion of Brahmanicide<br>which thou wilt take upon thyself shall immediately enter, and leaving<br>thee shall dwell in him. O carrier off oblations, let the fever of thy<br>heart be dispelled.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Thus addressed by the Grandsire the eater of oblations<br>and sacrificial offerings accepted his command. A fourth of that sin then<br>entered his person, O king! The Grandsire then summoned the trees, the<br>herbs, and all kinds of grass to him, and solicited them to take upon<br>themselves a fourth of that sin. Addressed by him, the trees and herbs<br>and grasses became as much agitated as Agni had been at the request, and<br>they replied unto Grandsire, saying, 'How shall we, O Grandsire of all<br>the worlds, be ourselves rescued from this sin? It behoveth thee not to<br>afflict us that have already been afflicted by the fates. O god, we have<br>always to endure heat and cold and the showers (of the clouds) driven by<br>the winds, in addition to the cutting and the tearing (that we have to<br>suffer at the hands of men). We are willing, O Lord of the three worlds,<br>to take at thy command (a portion of) this sin of Brahmanicide. Let the<br>means, however, of our rescue be pointed out to us.'<br><br>"Brahman said, 'This sin that you shall take shall possess the man who<br>through stupefaction of judgment will cut or tear any of you when Parva<br>days come.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Thus addressed by the high-souled Brahman, the trees and<br>herbs and grasses adored the Creator and then went away without tarrying<br>there. The Grandsire of all the worlds then summoned the Apsaras and<br>gratifying them with sweet words, O Bharata, said, 'This foremost of<br>ladies, viz., Brahmanicide, has come out of Indra's person. Solicited by<br>me, do you take a fourth portion of her into your own persons (for saving<br>the Chief of the deities).'<br><br>"The Apsaras said, 'O Lord of all the gods, at thy command we are fully<br>willing to take a portion of this sin. But, O Grandsire, do thou think of<br>the means by which we ourselves may be freed from (the effects of) this<br>understanding (that we make with thee).'<br><br>"Brahman said, 'Let the fever of your hearts be dispelled. The portion of<br>this sin that you will take upon yourselves shall leave you for instantly<br>possessing that man who will seek congress with women in their menstrual<br>season!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by the Grandsire, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, the diverse tribes of the Apsaras, with cheerful souls, repaired to<br>their respective places and began to sport in delight. The illustrious<br>Creator of the three worlds, endued with great ascetic merit, then<br>recollected the Waters which immediately came to him. Arrived at the<br>presence of Brahman of immeasurable energy, the Waters bowed unto him and<br>said these words, 'We have come before thee, O chastiser of foes, at thy<br>command. O puissant Master of all the worlds, tell us what we are to<br>accomplish.'<br><br>"Brahman said, 'This dreadful sin hath taken possession of Indra, in<br>consequence of his having slain Vritra. Take ye a fourth part of<br>Brahmanicide.'<br><br>"The Waters said, 'Let it be as thou commandest, O master of all the<br>worlds. It behoveth thee, however, O puissant Lord of ours, to think of<br>the means by which we may (in our turn) be rescued from (the consequence<br>of) this understanding. Though art the Lord of all the deities, and the<br>supreme refuge of the universe. Who else is there to whom we may pay our<br>adorations so that he may relieve us from distress.'<br><br>"Brahman said, 'Unto that man who stupefied by his understanding and<br>regarding you lightly will cast into you phlegm and urine and excreta,<br>this one shall immediately go and thenceforth reside in him. It is in<br>this way, verily I say unto ye, that your rescue shall be accomplished.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Then the sin of Brahmanicide, O Yudhishthira,<br>leaving the chief of the deities, proceeded to the abodes that were<br>ordained for her at the Grandsire's command. It was thus, O ruler of men,<br>that Indra had become afflicted by that dreadful sin (and it was thus<br>that he got rid of her). With the Grandsire's permission Indra then<br>resolved to perform a Horse-sacrifice. It is heard, O monarch, that Indra<br>having been thus possessed by the sin of Brahmanicide afterwards became<br>cleansed of her through that Sacrifice. Regaining his prosperity and<br>slaying thousands of foes, great was the joy that Vasava obtained, O lord<br>of Earth! From the blood of Vritra, O son of Pritha, were born<br>high-crested cocks. For this reason, those fowls are unclean (as food)<br>for the regenerate classes, and those ascetics that have undergone the<br>rite of initiation. Under all circumstances, O king, do thou accomplish<br>what is agreeable to the twice-born, for these, O monarch, are known as<br>gods on earth. It was in this way, O thou of Kurds race, that the mighty<br>Asura Vritra was slain by Sakra of immeasurable energy by the aid of<br>subtle intelligence and through the application of means. Thou also, O<br>son of Kunti, unvanquished on earth, wilt become another Indra and the<br>slayer of all thy foes. Those men who, on every Parva day, will recite<br>this sacred narrative of Vritra in the midst of Brahmanas shall never be<br>stained by any sin. I have now recited to thee one of the greatest and<br>most wonderful feats of Indra connected with Vritra. What else dost thou<br>wish to hear?'"
