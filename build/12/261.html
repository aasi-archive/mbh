                            "Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative of the<br>conversation of Tuladhara with Jajali on the topic of righteousness.<br>There was once a Brahmana of the name of Jajali who lived in a certain<br>forest, practising the ways of a forest-recluse.[1137] Of austere<br>penances, he proceeded on a certain occasion towards the sea-shore, and<br>having arrived there began to practise the most severe penances.<br>Observing many vows and restraints, his food regulated by many rules of<br>fast, his body clad in rags and skins, bearing matted locks on his head<br>his entire person smeared with filth and clay, that Brahmana possessed of<br>intelligence passed many years there, suspending speech (and engaged in<br>Yoga meditation). Possessed of great energy, that regenerate ascetic, O<br>monarch, while living within the waters (of the sea), roamed through all<br>the worlds with the speed of the mind, desirous of seeing all<br>things.[1138] Having beheld the whole earth bounded by the ocean and<br>adorned with rivers and lakes and woods, the ascetic one day, while<br>sitting under the water, began to think in this strain, 'In this world of<br>mobile and immobile creatures there is none equal to me. Who can roam<br>with me among the stars and planets in the firmament and dwell again<br>within the waters.' Unseen by the Rakshasas while he repeated this to<br>himself, the Pisachas said unto him, 'It behoves thee not to say so.<br>There is a man, named Tuladhara, possessed of great fame and engaged in<br>the business of buying and selling. Even he, O best of regenerate<br>persons, is not worthy of saying such words as thou sayest.' Thus<br>addressed by those beings, Jajali of austere penances replied unto them,<br>saying, 'I shall see that famous Tuladhara who is possessed of such<br>wisdom.' When the Rishi said those words, those superhuman beings raised<br>him from the sea, and said unto him, 'O best of regenerate persons, go<br>thou along this road.' Thus addressed by those beings, Jajali proceeded<br>onwards with a cheerless heart. Arrived at Varanasi he met Tuladhara whom<br>he addressed saying the following words.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'What, O sire, are those difficult feats that Jajali<br>had performed before in consequence of which he had acquired such high<br>success? It behoveth thee to describe them to me.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Jajali had become engaged in penances of the severest<br>austerities. He used to perform ablutions morning and evening. Carefully<br>tending his fires, he was devoted to the study of the Vedas.<br>Well-conversant with the duties laid down for forest recluses, Jajali (in<br>consequence of his practices) seemed to blaze with effulgence.[1139] He<br>continued to live in the woods, engaged all the while in penances. But he<br>never regarded himself as one that had acquired any merit by his acts. In<br>the season of the rains he slept under the open sky. In autumn he sat in<br>water. In summer he exposed himself to the sun and the wind. Still he<br>never regarded himself as one that had acquired any merit through such<br>acts. He used to sleep on diverse kinds of painful beds and also on the<br>bare earth. Once on a time, that ascetic, while standing under the sky in<br>the rainy season, received on his head repeated downpours from the<br>clouds. He had to pass through the woods repeatedly. What with exposure<br>to the rains and what with the filth they caught, the locks of that<br>sinless Rishi became entangled and intertwined with one another. On one<br>occasion, that great ascetic, abstaining entirely from food and living<br>upon air only, stood in the forest like a post of wood. Unmoved at heart,<br>he stood there, without once stirring an inch. While he stood there like<br>a wooden post, perfectly immovable, O Bharata, a pair of Kulinga birds, O<br>king, built their nest on his head. Filled with compassion, the great<br>Rishi suffered that feathery couple in building their nest among his<br>matted locks with shreds of grass. And as the ascetic stood there like a<br>post of wood, the two birds lived with confidence on his head happily.<br>The rains passed away and autumn came. The couple, urged by desire,<br>approached each other according to the law of the Creator, and in<br>complete confidence laid their eggs, O king, on the head of that Rishi.<br>Of rigid vows and possessed of energy, the ascetic knew it. Knowing what<br>the birds had done, Jajali moved not. Firmly resolved to acquire merit,<br>no act that involved the slightest injury to others could recommend<br>itself to him. The feathery couple going away and moving every day from<br>and to his head, happily and confidently lived there, O puissant king!<br>When in the progress of time the eggs became mature and young ones came<br>out, they began to grow up in that nest, for Jajali moved not in the<br>least. Firm in the observance of his vows, the righteous-souled Rishi<br>continued to hold and protect those eggs by standing on that very spot<br>perfectly motionless and rapt in Yoga meditation. In course of time the<br>young ones grew and became equipped with wings. The Muni knew that the<br>young Kulingas had attained to that stage of development. That foremost<br>of intelligent men, steady in the observance of vows, one day beheld<br>those young ones and became filled with pleasure. The parent-birds,<br>seeing their young ones equipped with wings, became very happy and<br>continued to dwell in the Rishi's head with them in perfect safety. The<br>learned Jajali saw that when the young birds became equipped with wings<br>they took to the air every evening and returned to his head without<br>having proceeded far. He still stood motionless on that spot. Sometimes,<br>after he saw that, left by their parents, they went out by themselves and<br>returned again by themselves. Jajali still moved not. A little while<br>after, the young birds going away in the morning passed the whole day out<br>of his sight, but came back in the evening for dwelling in the nest.<br>Sometimes, after that, leaving their nest for five days at a stretch,<br>they returned on the sixth day. Jajali still moved not. Subsequently,<br>when their strength became fully developed they left him and returned not<br>at all even after many days. At last, on one occasion, leaving him, they<br>came not even after a month. Then, O king, Jajali left that spot. When<br>they had thus gone away for good, Jajali wondered much, and thought that<br>he had achieved ascetic success. Then pride entered his heart. Firm in<br>the observance of vows, the great ascetic, seeing the birds thus leave<br>him after having been reared on his head, thought highly of himself, and<br>became filled with delight. He, then, bathed in a stream and poured<br>libations on the sacred fire, and paid his adorations to the rising Sun<br>indeed, having thus caused those chataka birds to grow on his head,<br>Jajali, that foremost of ascetics, began to slap his armpits and proclaim<br>loudly through the sky, '_I have won great merit_.' Then an invisible<br>voice arose in the sky and Jajali heard these words, 'Thou art not equal,<br>O Jajali, to Tuladhara in point of righteousness. Possessed of great<br>wisdom, that Tuladhara lives at Baranasi. Even he is not fit to say what<br>thou sayest, O regenerate one.' Hearing these words, Jajali became filled<br>with wrath, and desirous of meeting Tuladhara, O monarch, began to roam<br>over the whole earth, observing the vow of silence and passing the night<br>at that spot where evening overtook him.[1140] After a considerable time<br>he reached the city of Baranasi, and saw Tuladhara engaged in selling<br>miscellaneous articles.[1141] As soon as the shop-keeper Tuladhara beheld<br>the Brahmana arrived at his place, he cheerfully stood up and worshipped<br>the guest with proper salutations.[1142]<br><br>"Tuladhara said, 'Without doubt, O Brahmana, it is known to me that thou<br>hast come to _me_. Listen, however, O foremost of regenerate persons, to<br>what I say. Living on a low land near the sea-shore thou underwentest<br>very austere penances. But thou hadst no consciousness of having achieved<br>righteousness or merit. When thou didst at last attain to ascetic<br>success, certain birds were born on thy head. Thou tookest great care of<br>the little creatures. When at last those birds became equipped with wings<br>and when they began to leave thy head for going hither and thither in<br>search of food, it was then that, in consequence of having thus assisted<br>at the birth of those Chatakas, thou begannest to feel the impulse of<br>pride, O Brahmana, thinking thou hadst achieved great merit.[1143] Then,<br>O foremost of regenerate persons, thou heardest in the sky a voice that<br>referred to me. The words thou didst hear filled thee with wrath, and as<br>the consequence thereof thou art here. Tell me, what wish of thine I<br>shall accomplish, O best of Brahmanas!'"
