                            "The guest continued, 'For all that, O Brahmana, I shall endeavour to<br>instruct thee duly. Listen to me as I recite to thee that which I have<br>heard from my preceptor. In that place whence, in course of a former<br>creation, the wheel of righteousness was set in motion, in that forest<br>which is known by the name of Naimisha, and which is situate on the banks<br>of the Gomati, there is a city called after the Nagas. There, in that<br>region, all the deities, being assembled together, had in days of old<br>performed a grand sacrifice. There the foremost of earthly kings,<br>Mandhatri, vanquished Indra, the chief of the celestials. A mighty Naga,<br>of righteous soul, dwells in the city that stands in that region. That<br>great Naga is known by the name of Padmanabha or Padma. Walking in the<br>triple path (of acts, knowledge, and adoration) he gratifies all<br>creatures in thought, word, and deed. Reflecting upon all things with<br>great care, he protects the righteous and chastises the wicked by<br>adopting the quadruple policy of conciliation, provoking dissensions,<br>making gifts or bribes, and using force. Repairing thither, thou shouldst<br>put to him the questions thou wishest. He will show thee truly what the<br>highest religion is. That Naga is always fond of guests. Endued with<br>great intelligence, he is well conversant with the scriptures. He is<br>possessed of all desirable virtues the like of which are not to be<br>noticed in any other person. By disposition he is always observant of<br>those duties which are performed with or in water.[1930] He is devoted to<br>the study of the Vedas. He is endued with penances and self-restraint. He<br>has great wealth. He performs sacrifice, makes gifts, abstains from<br>inflicting injury and practises forgiveness. His conduct in all respects<br>is excellent. Truthful in speech and freed from malice, his behaviour, is<br>good and his senses are under proper control. He eats after feeding all<br>his guests and attendants. He is kind of speech. He has knowledge of what<br>is beneficial and what is simple and right and what is censurable. He<br>takes stock of what he does and what he leaves undone. He never acts with<br>hostility towards any one. He is always engaged in doing what is<br>beneficial to all creatures. He belongs to a family that is as pure and<br>stainless as the water of a lake in the midst of the Ganges.'"
