                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Creatures are seen to be afflicted by diverse means<br>and almost continually. Tell me, O grandsire, in what way can one<br>overcome all those difficulties.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Those members of the regenerate class that duly practise,<br>with restrained souls, the duties that have been laid down in the<br>scriptures for the several modes of life, succeed in overcoming all these<br>difficulties. They that never practise deceit, they whose behaviour is<br>restrained by salutary restrictions, and they that control all worldly<br>desires, succeed in overcoming all difficulties. They that do not speak<br>when, addressed in evil language, they that do not injure others when<br>themselves injured, they that give but do not take, succeed in overcoming<br>all difficulties. They that always give hospitable shelter to guests,<br>they that do not indulge in malice, they that are constantly engaged in<br>the study of the Vedas, succeed in overcoming all difficulties. Those<br>persons who, being conversant with duties, adopt that behaviour towards<br>parents which they should, they that abstain from sleeping during the<br>day, succeed in overcoming all difficulties. They that do not commit any<br>kind of sin in thought, word, and deed, they that never injure any<br>creature, succeed in overcoming all difficulties. Those kings that do<br>not, under the influence of passion and covetousness, levy oppressive<br>taxes, and those that protect their own dominions, succeed in overcoming<br>all difficulties. They that go to their own wedded wives in season<br>without seeking the companionship of other women, they that are honest<br>and attentive to their Agni-hotras, succeed in overcoming all<br>difficulties. They that are possessed of courage and that, casting away<br>all fear of death, engage in battle, desirous of victory by fair means,<br>succeed in overcoming all difficulties. They that always speak truth in<br>this world even when life is at stake, and that are exemplars for all<br>creatures to imitate succeed in overcoming all difficulties. They whose<br>acts never deceive, whose words are always agreeable, and whose wealth is<br>always well spent, succeed in, overcoming all difficulties. Those<br>Brahmanas that never study the Vedas at hours not intended for study, and<br>that practise penances with devotion, succeed in overcoming all<br>difficulties. Those Brahmanas that betake themselves to a life of<br>celibacy and Brahmacharya, that perform penances, and that are cleansed<br>by learning, Vedic knowledge, and proper vows, succeed in overcoming all<br>difficulties. They that have checked all the qualities that appertain to<br>Passion and Darkness, that are possessed of high souls, and that practise<br>the qualities that are called Good, succeed in overcoming all<br>difficulties. They of whom no creature stands in fear and those that do<br>not fear any creature themselves, they that look upon all creatures as<br>their own selves, succeed in overcoming all difficulties. Those bulls<br>among men that are good, that are never inspired with grief at the sight<br>of other people's prosperity, and that abstain from all kinds of ignoble<br>behaviour, succeed in overcoming all difficulties. They that bow to all<br>the gods, that listen to the doctrines of all creeds, that have faith,<br>and that are endued with tranquil souls, succeed in overcoming all<br>difficulties. They that do not desire honour for themselves, that give<br>honours unto others, that bow down unto those that deserve their worship,<br>succeed in overcoming all difficulties. They that perform Sraddhas on the<br>proper lunar days, with pure minds, from desire of offspring, succeed in<br>overcoming all difficulties. They that restrain their own wrath and<br>pacify the wrath of others, and that never get angry with any creature,<br>succeed in overcoming all difficulties. They that abstain, from their<br>birth, from honey and meat and intoxicating drinks, succeed in overcoming<br>all difficulties. They that eat for only supporting life, that seek the<br>companionship of women for the sake only of offspring and that open their<br>lips for only speaking what is true, succeed in overcoming all<br>difficulties. They that worship with devotion the god Narayana, that<br>Supreme Lord of all creatures, that origin and destruction of the<br>universe, succeed in overcoming all difficulties. This Krishna here, of<br>eyes red as the lotus, clad in yellow robes, endued with mighty<br>arms,&#8212;this Krishna who is our well-wisher, brother, friend, and<br>relative,&#8212;is Narayana of unfading glory. He covers all the worlds like a<br>leathern case, at his own pleasure. He is the puissant Lord, of<br>inconceivable soul. He is Govinda, the foremost of all beings. This<br>Krishna who is ever engaged in doing what is agreeable and beneficial to<br>Jishnu, as also to thee, O king, is that foremost of all beings, that<br>irresistible one, that abode of eternal felicity. They that with devotion<br>seek the refuge of this Narayana, called also Hari, succeed in overcoming<br>all difficulties. They that read these verses about the overcoming of<br>difficulties, that recite them to others, and that speak of them unto<br>Brahmanas, succeed in overcoming all difficulties. I have now, O sinless<br>one, told thee all those acts by which men may overcome all difficulties<br>both here and hereafter.'"
