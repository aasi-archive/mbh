                            "Yudhishthira said, 'When the high righteousness suffers decay and is<br>transgressed by all, when unrighteousness becomes righteousness, and<br>righteousness assumes the form of its reverse, when all wholesome<br>restraints disappear, and all truths in respect of righteousness are<br>disturbed and confounded, when people are oppressed by kings and robbers,<br>when men of all the four modes of life become stupefied in respect of<br>their duties, and all acts lose their merit, when men see cause of fear<br>on every direction in consequence of lust and covetousness and folly,<br>when all creatures cease to trust one another, when they slay one another<br>by deceitful means and deceive one another in their mutual dealings, when<br>houses are burnt down throughout the country, when the Brahmanas become<br>exceedingly afflicted, when the clouds do not pour a drop of rain, when<br>every one's hand is turned against every one's neighbour, when all the<br>necessaries of life fall under the power of robbers, when, indeed, such a<br>season of terrible distress sets in, by what means should a Brahmana live<br>who is unwilling to cast off compassion and his children? How, indeed,<br>should a Brahmana maintain himself at such a time? Tell me this, O<br>grandsire! How also should the king live at such a time when sinfulness<br>overtakes the world? How, O scorcher of foes, should the king live so<br>that he might not fall away from both righteousness and profit?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O mighty-armed one, the peace and prosperity of<br>subjects,[425] sufficiency and seasonableness of rain, disease, death and<br>other fears, are all dependent on the king.[426] I have no doubt also in<br>this. O bull of Bharata's race, that Krita, Treta, Dwapara, and Kali, as<br>regards their setting in, are all dependent on the king's conduct. When<br>such a season of misery as has been described by thee sets in, the<br>righteous should support life by the aid of judgment. In this connection<br>is cited the old story of the discourse between Viswamitra and the<br>Chandala in a hamlet inhabited by Chandalas. Towards the end of Treta and<br>the beginning of Dwapara, a frightful drought occurred, extending over<br>twelve years, in consequence of what the gods had ordained. At that time<br>which was the end of Treta and the commencement of Dwapara, when the<br>period came for many creatures superannuated by age to lay down their<br>lives, the thousand-eyed deity of heaven poured no rain. The planet<br>Vrihaspati began to move in a retrograde course, and Soma abandoning his<br>own orbit, receded towards the south. Not even could a dew-drop be seen,<br>what need then be said of clouds gathering together? The rivers all<br>shrank into narrow streamlets. Everywhere lakes and wells and springs<br>disappeared and lost their beauty in consequence of that order of things<br>which the gods brought about. Water having become scarce, the places set<br>up by charity for its distribution became desolate.[427] The Brahmanas<br>abstained from sacrifices and recitation of the Vedas. They no longer<br>uttered Vashats and performed other propitiatory rites. Agriculture and<br>keep of cattle were given up. Markets and shops were abandoned. Stakes<br>for tethering sacrificial animals disappeared. People no longer collected<br>diverse kinds of articles for sacrifices. All festivals and amusements<br>perished. Everywhere heaps of bones were visible and every place<br>resounded with the shrill cries and yells of fierce creatures.[428] The<br>cities and towns of the earth became empty of inhabitants. Villages and<br>hamlets were burnt down. Some afflicted by robbers, some by weapons, and<br>some by bad kings, and in fear of one another, began to fly away. Temples<br>and places of worship became desolate. They that were aged were forcibly<br>turned out of their houses. Kine and goats and sheep and buffaloes fought<br>(for food) and perished in large numbers. The Brahmanas began to die on<br>all sides. Protection was at an end. Herbs and plants were dried up. The<br>earth became shorn of all her beauty and exceedingly awful like the trees<br>in a crematorium. In that period of terror, when righteousness was<br>nowhere, O Yudhishthira, men in hunger lost their senses and began to eat<br>one another. The very Rishis, giving up their vows and abandoning their<br>fires and deities, and deserting their retreats in woods, began to wander<br>hither and thither (in search of food). The holy and great Rishi<br>Viswamitra, possessed of great intelligence, wandered homeless and<br>afflicted with hunger. Leaving his wife and son in some place of shelter,<br>the Rishi wandered, fireless[429] and homeless, and regardless of food<br>clean and unclean. One day he came upon a hamlet, in the midst of a<br>forest, inhabited by cruel hunters addicted to the slaughter of living<br>creatures. The little hamlet abounded with broken jars and pots made of<br>earth. Dog-skins were spread here and there. Bones and skulls, gathered<br>in heaps, of boars and asses, lay in different places. Cloths stripped<br>from the dead lay here and there, and the huts were adorned with garlands<br>of used up flowers.[430] Many of the habitations again were filled with<br>sloughs cast off by snakes. The place resounded with the loud crowing of<br>cocks and hens and the dissonant bray of asses. Here and there the<br>inhabitants disputed with one another, uttering harsh words in shrill<br>voices. Here and there were temples of gods bearing devices of owls and<br>other birds. Resounding with the tinkle of iron bells, the hamlet<br>abounded with canine packs standing or lying on every side. The great<br>Rishi Viswamitra, urged by pangs of hunger and engaged in search after<br>food, entered that hamlet and endeavoured his best to find something to<br>eat. Though the son of Kusika begged repeatedly, yet he failed to obtain<br>any meat or rice or fruit or root or any other kind of food. He then,<br>exclaiming, 'Alas, great is the distress that has overtaken me!' fell<br>down from weakness in that hamlet of the Chandalas. The sage began to<br>reflect, saying to himself, 'What is best for me to do now?' Indeed, O<br>best of kings, the thought that occupied him was of the means by which he<br>could avoid immediate death. He beheld, O king, a large piece of flesh,<br>of a dog that had recently been slain with a weapon, spread on the floor<br>of a Chandala's hut. The sage reflected and arrived at the conclusion<br>that he should steal that meat. And he said unto himself, 'I have no<br>means now of sustaining life. Theft is allowable in a season of distress<br>for even an eminent person. It will not detract from his glory. Even a<br>Brahmana for saving his life may do it. This is certain. In the first<br>place one should steal from a low person. Failing such a person one may<br>steal from one's equal. Failing an equal, one may steal from even an<br>eminent and righteous man. I shall then, at this time when my life itself<br>is ebbing away, steal this meat. I do not see demerit in such theft. I<br>shall, therefore, rob this haunch of dog's meat.' Having formed this<br>resolution, the great sage Viswamitra laid himself down for sleep in that<br>place where the Chandala was. Seeing some time after that the night had<br>advanced and that the whole Chandala hamlet had fallen asleep, the holy<br>Viswamitra, quietly rising up, entered that hut. The Chandala who owned<br>it, with eyes covered with phlegm, was lying like one asleep. Of<br>disagreeable visage, he said these harsh words in a broken and dissonant<br>voice.<br><br>"The Chandala said, 'Who is there, engaged in undoing the latch? The<br>whole Chandala hamlet is asleep. I, however, am awake and not asleep.<br>Whoever thou art, thou art about to be slain.' These were the harsh words<br>that greeted the sage's ears. Filled with fear, his face crimson with<br>blushes of shame, and his heart agitated by anxiety caused by that act of<br>theft which he had attempted, he answered, saying, 'O thou that art blest<br>with a long life, I am Viswamitra. I have come here oppressed by the<br>pangs of hunger. O thou of righteous understanding, do not slay me, if<br>thy sight be clear.' Hearing these words of that great Rishi of cleansed<br>soul, the Chandala rose up in terror from his bed and approached the<br>sage. Joining his palms from reverence and with eyes bathed in tears, he<br>addressed Kusika's son, saying, 'What do you seek here in the night, O<br>Brahmana?' Conciliating the Chandala, Viswamitra said, 'I am exceedingly<br>hungry and about to die of starvation. I desire to take away that haunch<br>of dog's meat. Being hungry, I have become sinful. One solicitous of food<br>has no shame. It is hunger that is urging me to this misdeed. It is for<br>this that I desire to take away that haunch of dog's meat. My<br>life-breaths are languishing. Hunger has destroyed my Vedic lore. I am<br>weak and have lost my senses. I have no scruple about clean or unclean<br>food. Although I know that it is sinful, still I wish to take away that<br>haunch of dog's meat. After I had filed to obtain any alms, having<br>wandered from house to house in this your hamlet, I set my heart upon<br>this sinful act of taking away this haunch of dog's meat. Fire is the<br>mouth of the gods. He is also their priest. He should, therefore, take<br>nothing save things that are pure and clean. At times, however, that<br>great god becomes a consumer of everything. Know that I have now become<br>even like him in that respect.' Hearing these words of the great Rishi,<br>the Chandala answered him, saying, 'Listen to me. Having heard the words<br>of truth that I say, act in such a way that thy religious merit may not<br>perish. Hear, O regenerate Rishi, what I say unto thee about thy duty.<br>The wise say that a dog is less clean than a jackal. The haunch, again,<br>of a dog is a much worse part than other parts of his body. This was not<br>wisely resolved by thee, therefore, O great Rishi, this act that is<br>inconsistent with righteousness, this theft of what belongs to a<br>Chandala, this theft, besides, of food that is unclean. Blessed be thou,<br>do thou look for some other means for preserving thy life. O great sage,<br>let not thy penances suffer destruction in consequence of this thy strong<br>desire for dog's meat. Knowing as thou dost the duties laid down in the<br>scriptures, thou shouldst not do an act whose consequence is a confusion<br>of duties.[431] Do not cast off righteousness, for thou art the foremost<br>of all persons observant of righteousness.' Thus addressed, O king, the<br>great Rishi Viswamitra, afflicted by hunger, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>once more said, 'A long time has passed away without my having taken any<br>food. I do not see any means again for preserving my life. One should,<br>when one is dying, preserve one's life by any means in one's power<br>without judging of their character. Afterwards, when competent, one<br>should seek the acquisition of merit. The Kshatriyas should observe the<br>practices of Indra. It is the duty of the Brahmanas to behave like Agni.<br>The Vedas are fire. They constitute my strength. I shall, therefore, eat<br>even this unclean food for appeasing my hunger. That by which life may be<br>preserved should certainly be accomplished without scruple. Life is<br>better than death. Living, one may acquire virtue. Solicitous of<br>preserving my life, I desire, with the full exercise of my understanding,<br>to eat this unclean food. Let me receive thy permission. Continuing to<br>live I shall seek the acquisition of virtue and shall destroy by penances<br>and by knowledge the calamities consequent on my present conduct, like<br>the luminaries of the firmament destroying even the thickest gloom.'<br><br>"The Chandala said, 'By eating this food one (like thee) cannot obtain<br>long life. Nor can one (like thee) obtain strength (from such food), nor<br>that gratification which ambrosia offers. Do thou seek for some other<br>kind of alms. Let not thy heart incline towards eating dog's meat. The<br>dog is certainly an unclean food to members of the regenerate classes.'<br><br>"Viswamitra said, 'Any other kind of meat is not to be easily had during<br>a famine like this. Besides, O Chandala, I have no wealth (wherewith to<br>buy food). I am exceedingly hungry. I cannot move any longer. I am<br>utterly hopeless. I think that all the six kinds of taste are to be found<br>in that piece of dog's meat.'<br><br>"The Chandala said, 'Only the five kinds of five-clawed animals are clean<br>food for Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas, as laid down in the<br>scriptures. Do not set thy heart upon what is unclean (for thee).'<br><br>"Viswamitra said, 'The great Rishi Agastya, while hungry, ate up the<br>Asura named Vatapi. I am fallen into distress. I am hungry. I shall<br>therefore, eat that haunch of dog's meat.'<br><br>"The Chandala said, 'Do thou seek some other alms. It behoves thee not to<br>do such a thing. Verily, such an act should never be done by thee. If<br>however, it pleases thee, thou mayst take away this piece of dog's meat.'<br><br>"Viswamitra said, 'They that are called good are authorities in matters<br>of duty. I am following their example. I now regard this dog's haunch to<br>be better food than anything that is highly pure.'<br><br>"The Chandala said, 'That which is the act of an unrighteous person can<br>never be regarded as an eternal practice. That which is an improper act<br>can never be a proper one. Do not commit a sinful act by deception.'<br><br>"Viswamitra said, 'A man who is a Rishi cannot do what is sinful.[432] In<br>the present case, deer and dog, I think, are same (both being animals). I<br>shall, therefore, eat this dog's haunch.'<br><br>"The Chandala said, "Solicited by the Brahmanas, the Rishi (Agastya) did<br>that act. Under the circumstances it could not be a sin. That is<br>righteousness in which there is no sin. Besides, the Brahmanas, who are<br>the preceptors of three other orders, should be protected and preserved<br>by every means.'<br><br>"Viswamitra said, 'I am a Brahmana. This my body is a friend of mine. It<br>is very dear to me and is worthy of the highest reverence from me. It is<br>from the desire of sustaining the body that the wish is entertained by me<br>of taking away that dog's haunch. So eager have I become that I have no<br>longer any fear of thee and thy fierce brethren.'<br><br>"The Chandala said, 'Men lay down their lives but they still do not set<br>their hearts on food that is unclean. They obtain the fruition of all<br>their wishes even in this world by conquering hunger. Do thou also<br>conquer thy hunger and obtain those rewards.'<br><br>"Viswamitra said, 'As regards myself, I am observant of rigid vows and my<br>heart is set on peace. For preserving the root of all religious merit, I<br>shall eat food that is unclean. It is evident that such an act would be<br>regarded as righteous in a person of cleansed soul. To a person, however,<br>of uncleansed soul, the eating of dog's flesh would appear sinful. Even<br>if the conclusion to which I have arrived be wrong, (and if I eat this<br>dog's meat) I shall not, for that act, become one like thee.'<br><br>"The Chandala said, 'It is my settled conclusion that I should endeavour<br>my best to restrain thee from this sin. A Brahmana by doing a wicked act<br>falls off from his high state. It is for this that I am reproving thee.'<br><br>"Viswamitra said, 'Kine continue to drink, regardless of the croaking of<br>the frogs. Thou canst lay no claim to what constitutes righteousness (and<br>what not). Do not be a self-eulogiser.'<br><br>"The Chandala said, 'I have become thy friend. For this reason only I am<br>preaching to thee. Do what is beneficial. Do not, from temptation, do<br>what is sinful.'<br><br>"Viswamitra said, 'If thou be a friend desirous of my happiness, do thou<br>then raise me up from this distress. In that case, relinquishing this<br>dog's haunch, I may consider myself saved by the aid of righteousness<br>(and not by that of sinfulness).'<br><br>"The Chandala said, 'I dare not make a present of this piece of meat to<br>thee, nor can I quietly suffer thee to rob me of my own food. If I give<br>thee this meat and if thou take it, thyself being a Brahmana, both of us<br>will become liable to sink in regions of woe in the next world.'<br><br>"Viswamitra said, 'By committing this sinful act today I shall certainly<br>save my life which is very sacred. Having saved my life, I shall<br>afterwards practise virtue and cleanse my soul. Tell me which of these<br>two is preferable (to die without food, or save my life by taking this<br>food that is unclean).'<br><br>"The Chandala said: 'In discharging the duties that appertain to one's<br>order or race, one's own self is the best judge (of its propriety or<br>impropriety). Thou thyself knowest which of those two acts is sinful. He<br>who would regard dog's meat as clean food, I think, would in matters of<br>food abstain from nothing!'<br><br>"Viswamitra said, 'In accepting (an unclean present) or in eating<br>(unclean food) there is sin. When one's life, however, is in danger there<br>is no sin in accepting such a present or eating such food. Besides, the<br>eating of unclean food, when unaccompanied by slaughter and deception and<br>when the act will provoke only mild rebuke, is not matter of much<br>consequence.'<br><br>"The Chandala said, 'If this be thy reason for eating unclean food, it is<br>then clear thou dost not regard the Veda and Arya morality. Taught by<br>what thou art going to do, I see, O foremost of Brahmanas, that there is<br>no sin in disregarding the distinction between food that is clean and<br>food that is unclean.'<br><br>"Viswamitra said, 'It is not seen that a person incurs a grave sin by<br>eating (forbidden food). That one becomes fallen by drinking wine is only<br>a wordy precept (for restraining men from drinking). The other forbidden<br>acts (of the same species), whatever they be, in fact, every sin, cannot<br>destroy one's merit.'<br><br>"The Chandala said, 'That learned person who takes away dog's meat from<br>an unworthy place (like this), from an unclean wretch (like me), from one<br>who (like me) leads such a wicked life, commits an act that is opposed to<br>the behaviour of those that are called good. In consequence, again, of<br>his connection with such a deed, he is certain to suffer the pangs of<br>repentance.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The Chandala, having said these words unto Kusika's<br>son, became silent. Viswamitra then, of cultivated understanding, took<br>away that haunch of dog's meat. The great ascetic having possessed<br>himself of that piece of dog's meat for saving his life, took it away<br>into the woods and wished with his wife to eat it. He resolved that<br>having first gratified the deities according to due rites, he should then<br>eat that haunch of dog's meat at his pleasure. Igniting a fire according<br>to the Brahma rites, the ascetic, agreeably to those rites that go by the<br>name of Aindragneya, began himself to cook that meat into sacrificial<br>Charu. He then, O Bharata, began the ceremonies in honour of the gods and<br>the Pitris, by dividing that Charu into as many portions as were<br>necessary, according to the injunctions of the scriptures, and by<br>invoking the gods with Indra at their head (for accepting their shares).<br>Meanwhile, the chief of the celestials began to pour copiously. Reviving<br>all creatures by those showers, he caused plants and herbs to grow once<br>more. Viswamitra, however, having completed the rites in honour of the<br>gods and the Pitris and having gratified them duly, himself ate that<br>meat. Burning all his sins afterwards by his penances, the sage, after a<br>long time, acquired the most wonderful (ascetic) success. Even thus, when<br>the end in view is the preservation of life itself, should a high-souled<br>person possessed of learning and acquainted with means rescue his own<br>cheerless self, when fallen into distress, by all means in his power. By<br>having recourse to such understanding one should always preserve one's<br>life. A person, if alive, can win religious merit and enjoy happiness and<br>prosperity. For this reason, O son of Kunti, a person of cleansed soul<br>and possessed of learning should live and act in this world, relying upon<br>his own intelligence in discriminating between righteousness and its<br>reverse.'"
