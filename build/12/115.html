                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, O thou that art possessed of great<br>wisdom, I have one great doubt that perplexes me. Thou shouldst, O king,<br>resolve it. Thou art an advancer of our family. Thou hast discoursed to<br>us upon the slanderous speeches uttered by wicked-souled wretches of bad<br>conduct. I desire, however, to question thee further. That which is<br>beneficial to a kingdom, that which is productive of the happiness of the<br>royal line, that which is productive of good and advancement in the<br>future and the present, that which is good in respect of food and drink<br>and as regards also the body, are topics upon which I wish thee to<br>discourse. How should a king who has been placed on the throne and who<br>continues to occupy it, surrounded by friends, ministers, and servants<br>gratify his people. That king who, led away by his affections and<br>predilections, becomes devoted to evil associates, and who pays court to<br>wicked men in consequence of his being enthralled by his senses, finds<br>all servants of good birth and blood disaffected towards him. Such a king<br>never succeeds in obtaining those objects the accomplishment of which<br>depends upon one's having a number of good servants about him. It<br>behoveth thee that art equal to Vrihaspati himself in intelligence to<br>discourse to me upon these duties of kings which are difficult to be<br>ascertained and thereby remove my doubts. Thou, O tiger among men, art<br>ever engaged in accomplishing the good of our race. For this reason thou<br>always discoursest to us on the duties of king-craft. Kshatri (Vidura)<br>also, possessed of great wisdom, always gives us valuable instruction.<br>Hearing instructions from thee that are productive of good to our race<br>and kingdom, I shall be able to pass my days in happiness like a person<br>gratified with having quaffed the deathless Amrita. What classes of<br>servants are to be regarded as inferior and what is possessed of every<br>accomplishment? Aided by what class of servants or by servants of what<br>kind of birth, is it advisable to discharge the duties of ruling? If the<br>king choose to act alone and without servants, he can never succeed in<br>protecting his people. All persons, however, of high birth covet the<br>acquisition of sovereignty.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The king, O Bharata, cannot alone rule his kingdom.<br>Without servants to aid him, he cannot succeed in accomplishing any<br>object. Even if he succeeds in gaining any object, he cannot (if alone),<br>retain it. That king whose servants are all possessed of knowledge and<br>wisdom, who are all devoted to the good of their master, and who are of<br>high birth and tranquil disposition, succeeds in enjoying the happiness<br>connected with sovereignty. That king whose ministers are all well born,<br>incapable of being weaned away from him (by means of bribes and other<br>influences), who always live with him, who are engaged in giving advice<br>to their master, who are possessed of wisdom and goodness, who have a<br>knowledge of the relations of things, who can provide for future events<br>and contingencies, who have a good knowledge of the virtues of time, and<br>who never grieve for what is past, succeeds in enjoying the happiness<br>that attaches to sovereignty. That king whose servants share with him his<br>griefs and joys, who always do what is agreeable to him, who always<br>direct their attention to the accomplishment of their master's objects,<br>and all of whom are faithful, succeeds in enjoying the happiness that<br>attaches to sovereignty. The king whose subjects are always cheerful, and<br>high minded, and who always tread in the path of the righteousness,<br>succeeds in enjoying the happiness attached to sovereignty. He is the<br>best of kings all the sources of whose income are managed and supervised<br>by contented and trustworthy men well acquainted with the means of<br>increasing the finances. That king succeeds in obtaining affluence and<br>great merit whose repositories and barns are supervised by incorruptible,<br>trust-worthy, devoted, and uncovetous servants always bent upon<br>gathering. That king in whose city justice is administered properly with<br>the result of such administration leading to the well known results of<br>fining the plaintiff or the defendant if his case is untrue, and in which<br>criminal laws are administered even after the manner of Sankha and<br>Likhita, succeeds in earning the merit that attaches to sovereignty. That<br>king who attaches his subjects to himself by kindness, who is conversant<br>with the duties of kings, and who attends to the aggregate of six.<br>succeeds in earning the merit that attaches to sovereignty.'"
