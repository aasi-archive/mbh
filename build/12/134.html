                            "Bhishma said, 'In this connection, persons acquainted with the<br>scriptures declare this text in respect of duty, viz., for a Kshatriya<br>possessed of intelligence and knowledge, (the earning of) religious merit<br>and (the acquisition of) wealth, constitute his obvious duties. He should<br>not, by subtle discussions on duty and unseen consequences in respect of<br>a future world, abstain from accomplishing those two duties. As it is<br>useless to argue, upon seeing certain foot-prints on the ground, whether<br>they are wolf's or not, even so is all discussion upon the nature of<br>righteousness and the reverse. Nobody in this world ever sees the fruits<br>of righteousness and unrighteousness. A Kshatriya, therefore, should seek<br>the acquisition of power. He that is powerful is master of everything.<br>Wealth leads to the possession of an army. He that is powerful[404]<br>obtains intelligent advisers. He that is without wealth is truly fallen.<br>A little (of anything in the world) is regarded as the dirty remnant of a<br>feast.[405] If a strong man does even many bad acts, nobody, through<br>fear, says or does anything (for censuring or checking him). If<br>righteousness and Power be associated with Truth, they can then rescue<br>men from great perils. If, however, the two be compared, Power will<br>appear to be superior to Righteousness. It is from Power that<br>Righteousness springs. Righteousness rests upon Power as all immobile<br>things upon the earth. As smoke depends upon the wind (for its motion),<br>even so Righteousness depends upon Power. Righteousness which is the<br>weaker of the two depends for its support upon a tree. Righteousness is<br>dependent on them that are powerful even as pleasure is dependent upon<br>them that are given to enjoyment. There is nothing that powerful men<br>cannot do. Everything is pure with them that are powerful. A powerless<br>man, by committing evil acts can never escape. Men feel alarmed at his<br>conduct even as they are alarmed at the appearance of a wolf. One fallen<br>away from a state of affluence leads a life of humiliation and sorrow. A<br>life of humiliation and reproach is like death itself The learned have<br>said that when in consequence of one's sinful conduct one is cast off by<br>friends and companions, one is pierced repeatedly by the wordy darts of<br>others and one has to burn with grief on that account. Professors of<br>scriptures have said with respect to the expiation of sinfulness that one<br>should (if stained with sinfulness) study the three Vedas, wait upon and<br>worship the Brahmanas, gratify all men by looks, words, and acts, cast<br>off all meanness, marry in high families, proclaim the praises of others<br>while confessing one's own worthlessness, recite mantras, perform the<br>usual water-rites, assume a mildness of behaviour, and abstain from<br>speaking much, and perform austere penances, seek the refuge of Brahmanas<br>and Kshatriyas. Indeed, one who has committed many evil acts, should do<br>all this, without being angry at the reproaches uttered by men. By<br>conducting one's self in this way, one may soon become cleansed of all<br>his sins and regain the regard of the world. Indeed, one wins great<br>respect in this world and great rewards in the next, and enjoys diverse<br>kinds of happiness here by following such conduct and by sharing his<br>wealth with others.'"
