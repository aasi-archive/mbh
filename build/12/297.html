                            "Janaka said, 'Whence, O great Rishi, does this difference of colour<br>arise among men belonging to the different orders? I desire to know this.<br>Tell me this, O foremost of speakers! The Srutis say that the offspring<br>one begets are one's own self. Originally sprung from Brahmana, all the<br>inhabitants of the earth should have been Brahmanas. Sprung from<br>Brahmanas, why have men betaken themselves to practices distinguished<br>from those of Brahmanas.'<br><br>"Parasara said, 'It is as thou sayst, O king! The offspring procreated<br>are none else than the procreator himself. In consequence, however, of<br>falling away from penance, this distribution into classes of different<br>colours has taken place. When the soil becomes good and the seed also is<br>good, the offspring produced become meritorious. If, however, the soil<br>and seed become otherwise or inferior, the offspring that will be born<br>will be inferior. They that are conversant with the scriptures know that<br>when the Lord of all creatures set himself to create the worlds, some<br>creatures sprang from his mouth, some from his arms, some from his<br>thighs, and some from his feet. They that thus sprang from his mouth, O<br>child, came to be called Brahmanas. They that sprang from his arms were<br>named Kshatriyas. They, O king, that sprang from his thighs were the<br>wealthy class called the Vaisyas. And, lastly, they that were born of his<br>feet were the serving class, viz., the Sudras. Only these four orders of<br>men, O monarch, were thus created. They that belong to classes over and<br>other than these are said to have sprung from an intermixture of these.<br>The Kshatriyas called Atirathas, Amvashthas, Ugras, Vaidehas, Swapakas,<br>Pukkasas, Tenas, Nishadas, Sutas, Magadhas, Ayogas, Karanas, Vratyas, and<br>Chandalas, O monarch, have all sprung from the four original orders by<br>intermixture with one another.'<br><br>"Janaka said, 'When all have sprung from Brahmana alone, how came human<br>beings to have diversity in respect of race? O best of ascetics, an<br>infinite diversity of races is seen in this world. How could men devoted<br>to penances attain, to the status of Brahmanas, though of indiscriminate<br>origin? Indeed, those born of pure wombs and those of impure, all became<br>Brahmanas.'<br><br>"Parasara said, 'O king, the status of high-souled persons that succeeded<br>in cleansing their souls by penances could not be regarded as affected by<br>their low births. Great Rishis, O monarch, by begetting children in<br>indiscriminate wombs, conferred upon them the status of Rishis by means<br>of their power of asceticism. My grandfather Vasishtha, Rishyasringa,<br>Kasyapa, Veda, Tandya, Kripa, Kakshivat, Kamatha, and others, and<br>Yavakrita, O king, and Drona, that foremost of speakers, and Ayu, and<br>Matanga, and Datta, and Drupada, and Matsya, all these, O ruler of the<br>Videhas, obtained their respective positions through penance as the<br>means. Originally only four Gotras (races) arose, O monarch, viz.,<br>Angiras, Kasyapa, Vasishtha, and Bhrigu. In consequence of acts and<br>behaviour, O ruler of men, many other Gotras came into existence in time.<br>The names of those Gotras have been due to the penances of those that<br>have founded them. Good people use them.'<br><br>"Janaka said, 'Tell me, O holy one, the especial duties of the several<br>orders. Tell me also what their common duties are. Thou art conversant<br>with everything.'<br><br>"Parasara said, 'Acceptance of gifts, officiation at the sacrifices of<br>others, and the teaching of pupils, O king, are the especial duties of<br>the Brahmanas. The protection of the other orders is proper for the<br>Kshatriya. Agriculture, cattle-rearing, and trade are the occupations of<br>the Vaisyas. While service of the (three) regenerate classes is the<br>occupation, O king, of the Sudras. I have now told thee what the especial<br>duties are of the four orders, O monarch. Listen now to me, O child, as I<br>tell thee what the common duties are of all the four orders. Compassion,<br>abstention from injury, heedfulness, giving to others what is due to<br>them, Sraddhas in honour of deceased ancestors, hospitality to guests,<br>truthfulness, subjugation of wrath, contentedness with one's own wedded<br>wives, purity (both internal and external), freedom from malice,<br>knowledge of Self, and Renunciation,&#8212;these duties, O king, are common to<br>all the orders. Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas,&#8212;these are the three<br>regenerate orders. All of them have an equal right to the performance of<br>these duties, O foremost of men. These three orders, betaking themselves<br>to duties other than those laid down for them, come to grief, O monarch<br>(and fall down from their own status), even as they go up and acquire<br>great merit by taking for their model some righteous individual of their<br>respective classes who is duly observant of his own duties. The Sudra<br>never falls down (by doing forbidden acts); nor is he worthy of any of<br>the rites of regeneration. The course of duties flowing from the Vedas is<br>not his. He is not interdicted, however, from practising the three and<br>ten duties that are common to all the orders. O ruler of the Videhas,<br>Brahmanas learned in the Vedas, O monarch, regard a (virtuous) Sudra as<br>equal to Brahmana himself. I, however, O king, look upon such a Sudra as<br>the effulgent Vishnu of the universe, the foremost one in all the<br>worlds.[1544] Persons of the lowest order, desiring to exterminate the<br>evil passions (of lust and wrath, etc.) may betake themselves to the<br>observance of the conduct of the good; and, indeed, while so acting, they<br>may earn great merit by performing all rites that lead to advancement,<br>omitting the mantras that are utterable by the other orders while<br>performing the self-same ceremonies. Wherever persons of the lowest order<br>adopt the behaviour of the good, they succeed in attaining to happiness<br>in consequence of which they are able to pass their time in felicity both<br>here and hereafter.'<br><br>"Janaka said, 'O great ascetic, is man stained by his acts or is he<br>stained by the order or class in which he is born? A doubt has arisen in<br>my mind. It behoveth thee to expound this to me.'<br><br>"Parasara said, 'Without doubt, O king, both, viz., acts and birth, are<br>sources of demerit. Listen now to their difference. That man who, though<br>stained by birth, does not commit sin, abstains from sin notwithstanding<br>birth and acts. If, however, a person of superior birth perpetrates<br>censurable acts, such acts stain him. Hence, of the two, viz., acts and<br>birth, acts stain man (more than birth).[1545]<br><br>"Janaka said, 'What are those righteous acts in this world, O best of all<br>regenerate persons, the accomplishment of which does not inflict any<br>injury upon other creatures?'<br><br>"Parasara said, 'Hear from me, O monarch, about what thou askest me'<br>viz., those acts free from injury which always rescue man. Those who,<br>keeping aside their domestic fires, have dissociated themselves from all<br>worldly attachments, become freed from all anxieties. Gradually ascending<br>step by step, in the path of Yoga, they at last behold the stage of<br>highest felicity (viz., Emancipation).[1546] Endued with faith and<br>humility, always practising self-restraint, possessed of keen<br>intelligence, and abstaining from all acts, they attain to eternal<br>felicity. All classes of men, O king, by properly accomplishing acts that<br>are righteous, by speaking the truth, and by abstaining from<br>unrighteousness, in this world, ascend to heaven. In this there is no<br>doubt.'"
