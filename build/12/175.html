                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Time, which is destructive of every created thing,<br>is passing on.[512] Tell me, O grandsire, what is that good thing which<br>should be sought.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection, O king, is cited the old narrative of<br>a discourse between sire and son, O Yudhishthira! A certain Brahmana. O<br>Partha, who was devoted to the study of the Vedas, got a very intelligent<br>son who (for this) was called Medhavin.[513] One day, the son, well<br>conversant with the truths of the religion of Emancipation, and<br>acquainted also with the affairs of the world, addressed his sire devoted<br>to the study of the Vedas.'<br><br>"The son said, 'What should a wise man do, O father, seeing that the<br>period of human life is passing away so very quickly? O father, tell me<br>the course of duties that one should perform, without omitting to mention<br>the fruits. Having listened to thee, I desire to observe those duties.'<br><br>"The sire said, 'O son, observing the Brahmacharya mode of life, one<br>should first study the Vedas. He should then wish for children for<br>rescuing his ancestors. Setting up his fire next, he should seek to<br>perform the (prescribed) sacrifices according to due rites. At last, he<br>should enter the forest for devoting himself to contemplation.'<br><br>"The son said, 'When the world is thus surrounded on all sides and is<br>thus assailed, and when such irresistible things of fatal consequences<br>fall upon it, how can you say these words so calmly?'<br><br>"The sire said, How is the world assailed? What is that by which it is<br>surrounded? What, again, are those irresistible things of fatal<br>consequences that fall upon it? Why dost thou frighten me thus?'<br><br>"The son said, 'Death is that by which the world is assailed. Decrepitude<br>encompasses it. Those irresistible things that come and go away are the<br>nights (that are continually lessening the period of human life). When I<br>know that Death tarries for none (but approaches steadily towards every<br>creature), how can I pass my time without covering myself with the garb<br>of knowledge?[514] When each succeeding night, passing away lessens the<br>allotted period of one's existence, the man of wisdom should regard the<br>day to be fruitless. (When death is approaching steadily) who is there<br>that would, like a fish in a shallow water, feel happy? Death comes to a<br>man before his desires have been gratified. Death snatches away a person<br>when he is engaged in plucking flowers and when his heart is otherwise<br>set, like a tigress bearing away a ram. Do thou, this very day,<br>accomplish that which is for thy good. Let not this Death come to thee.<br>Death drags its victims before their acts are accomplished. The acts of<br>tomorrow should be done today, those of the afternoon in the forenoon.<br>Death does not wait to see whether the acts of its victim have all been<br>accomplished or not. Who knows that Death will not come to him even<br>today? In prime of age one should betake oneself to the practice of<br>virtue. Life is transitory. If virtue be practised, fame here and<br>felicity hereafter will be the consequences. Overwhelmed by ignorance,<br>one is ready to exert oneself for sons and wives. Achieving virtuous or<br>vicious acts, one brings them up and aggrandises them. Like a tiger<br>bearing away a sleeping deer, Death snatches away the man addicted to the<br>gratification of desire and engaged in the enjoyment of sons and animals.<br>Before he has been able to pluck the flowers upon which he has set his<br>heart, before he has been gratified by the acquisition of the objects of<br>his desire, Death bears him away like a tiger bearing away its prey.<br>Death overpowers a man while the latter is stilt in the midst of the<br>happiness that accrues from the gratification of desire, and while, still<br>thinking, 'This has been done; this is to be done; this has been<br>half-done.' Death bears away the man, however designated according to his<br>profession, attached to his field, his shop, or his home, before he has<br>obtained the fruit of his acts. Death bears away the weak, the strong,<br>the brave, the timid, the idiotic, and the learned, before any of these<br>obtains the fruits of his acts. When death, decrepitude, disease, and<br>sorrow arising from diverse causes, are all residing in thy body, how is<br>it that thou livest as if thou art perfectly hale? As soon as a creature<br>is born, Decrepitude and Death pursue him for (effecting) his<br>destruction. All existent things, mobile and immobile, are affected by<br>these two. The attachment which one feels for dwelling in villages and<br>towns (in the midst of fellowmen) is said to be the very mouth of Death.<br>The forest, on the other hand, is regarded as the fold within which the<br>senses may be penned. This is declared by the Srutis.[515] The attachment<br>a person feels for dwelling in a village or town (in the midst of men) is<br>like a cord that binds him effectually. They that are good break that<br>cord and attain to emancipation, while they that are wicked do not<br>succeed in breaking them. He who never injures living creatures by<br>thought, word, or deed, is never injured by such agencies as are<br>destructive of life and property.[516] Nothing can resist the messengers<br>(Disease and Decrepitude) of Death when they advance except Truth which<br>devours Untruth. In Truth is immortality.[517] For these reasons one<br>should practise the vow of Truth; one should devote oneself to a union<br>with Truth; one should accept Truth for one's Veda; and restraining one's<br>senses, one should vanquish the Destroyer by Truth. Both Immortality and<br>Death are planted in the body. One comes to Death through ignorance and<br>loss of judgment; while Immortality is achieved through Truth. I shall,<br>therefore, abstain from injury and seek to achieve Truth, and<br>transgressing the sway of desire and wrath, regard pleasure and pain with<br>an equal eye, and attaining tranquillity, avoid Death like an immortal.<br>Upon the advent of that season when the sun will progress towards the<br>north, I shall restraining my senses, set to the performance of the<br>Santi-sacrifice, the Brahma-sacrifice, the Mind-sacrifice, and the<br>Work-sacrifice.[518] How can one like me worship his Maker in<br>animal-sacrifices involving cruelty, or sacrifices of the body, such as<br>Pisachas only can perform and such as produce fruits that are<br>transitory?[519] That person whose words, thoughts, penances,<br>renunciation, and yoga meditation, all rest on Brahma, succeeds in<br>earning the highest good. There is no eye which is equal to (the eye of)<br>Knowledge. There is no penance like (that involved in) Truth. There is no<br>sorrow equal to (that involved in) attachment. There is no happiness<br>(that which is obtainable from) renunciation. I have sprung from Brahma<br>through Brahma. I shall devote myself to Brahma, though I am childless. I<br>shall return to Brahma. I do not require a son for rescuing me. A<br>Brahmana can have no wealth like to the state of being alone, the state<br>in consequence of which he is capable of regarding everything with an<br>equal eye, the practice of truthfulness, good behaviour, patience,<br>abstention from injury, simplicity, and avoidance of all rites and<br>visible sacrifices. What use hast thou, O Brahmana, of wealth or kinsmen<br>and relatives, of wives, when thou shalt have to die? Seek thy Self which<br>is concealed in a cave. Where are thy grandsires and where thy sire?'[520]<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Do thou also, O monarch, conduct thyself in that way<br>in which the sire (in this story), conducts himself, devoted to the<br>religion of Truth, after having listened to the speech of his son.'
