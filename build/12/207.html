                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, O thou of great wisdom, I desire to<br>hear in detail, O chief of the Bharatas, of that lotus-eyed and<br>indestructible one, who is the Creator of everything but who has been<br>created by none, who is called Vishnu (in consequence of his pervading<br>everything), who is the origin of all creatures and unto whom all<br>creatures return, who is known by the names of Narayana and Hrishikesa<br>and Govinda and Kesava, and who is incapable of being vanquished by any<br>one.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I have heard of this subject from Jamadagni's son Rama,<br>while he discoursed on it, from the celestial Rishi Narada, and from<br>Krishna-Dwaipayana. Asita-Devala, O son, Valmiki of austere penances, and<br>Markandeya, speak of Govinda as the Most Wonderful and the Supreme.<br>Kesava, O chief of Bharata's race, is the divine and puissant Lord of<br>all. He is called Purusha, and pervades everything, having made himself<br>many. Listen now, O Yudhishthira of mighty arms, to those attributes<br>which great Brahmanas say are to be met with in the high-souled wielder<br>of Saranga. I shall also, O prince of men, recite to thee those acts<br>which persons conversant with old histories ascribe to Govinda. He is<br>said to be the Soul of all creatures, the high-souled one, and the<br>foremost of all beings. He created (by his will) the five-fold elements,<br>viz., Wind, Light, Water, Space, and Earth. That puissant Lord of all<br>things, that high-souled one, that foremost of all beings, having created<br>the earth, laid himself down on the surface of the waters. While thus<br>floating upon the waters, that foremost of all beings, that refuge of<br>every kind of energy and splendour, created Consciousness, the first-born<br>of beings in the universe. We have heard that He created Consciousness<br>along with the Mind,&#8212;Consciousness which is the refuge of all created<br>things. That Consciousness upholds all creatures and both the past and<br>the future. After that great Being, O mighty-armed one, viz.,<br>Consciousness, had sprung, an exceedingly beautiful lotus, possessed of<br>effulgence like the Sun's, grew out of the navel of the Supreme Being<br>(floating on the waters). Then, O son, the illustrious and divine<br>Brahman, the Grandsire of all creatures, sprang into existence from that<br>lotus, irradiating all the points of the horizon with his effulgence.<br>After the high-souled Grandsire had, O mighty-armed one, thus sprung from<br>the primeval lotus, a great Asura of the name of Madhu, having no<br>beginning, started into birth, springing from the attribute or Darkness<br>(Tamas). The foremost of all Beings, (viz., the Supreme Divinity), for<br>benefiting Brahman, slew that fierce Asura of fierce deeds, engaged even<br>then in the fierce act (of slaying the Grand-sire). From this slaughter,<br>O son, (of the Asura named Madhu), all the gods and the Danavas and men<br>came to call that foremost of all righteous persons by the name of<br>Madhusudana (slayer of Madhu).[704] After this, Brahman created, by a<br>flat of his will, seven sons with Daksha completing the tale. They were<br>Marichi, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, (and the already<br>mentioned Daksha). The eldest born, viz., Marichi, begat, by a fiat of<br>his will, a son named Kasyapa, full of energy and the foremost of all<br>persons conversant with Brahma. From his toe, Brahman had, even before<br>the birth of Marichi, created a son. That son, O chief of Bharata's race,<br>was Daksha, the progenitor of creatures.[705] Unto Daksha were first born<br>three and ten daughters, O Bharata, the eldest of whom was called Diti.<br>Marichi's son Kasyapa, O sire, who was conversant with all duties and<br>their distinctions, who was of righteous deeds and great fame, became the<br>husband of those thirteen daughters. The highly-blessed Daksha (besides<br>the three and ten already spoken of) next begat ten other daughters. The<br>progenitor of creatures, viz., the righteous Daksha, bestowed these upon<br>Dharma. Dharma became father of the Vasus, the Rudras of immeasurable<br>energy, the Viswedevas, the Sadhyas, and the Maruts, O Bharata. Daksha<br>next begat seven and twenty other younger daughters. The highly-blessed<br>Soma became the husband of them all. The other wives of Kasyapa gave<br>birth to Gandharvas, horses, birds, kine, Kimpurushas, fishes, and trees<br>and plants. Aditi gave birth to the Adityas. the foremost ones among the<br>gods, and possessed of great strength. Amongst them Vishnu took birth in<br>the form of a dwarf. Otherwise called Govinda, he became the foremost of<br>them all. Through his prowess, the prosperity of the gods increased. The<br>Danavas were vanquished. The offspring of Diti were the Asuras. Danu gave<br>birth to the Danavas having Viprachitti for their foremost. Diti gave<br>birth to all the Asuras of great strength.<br><br>"The slayer of Madhu also created the Day and the Night, and the Season<br>in their order, and the Morn and the Even. After reflection, he also<br>created the clouds, and all the (other) immobile and mobile objects.<br>Possessed of abundant energy, he also created the Viswas and the earth<br>with all things upon her. Then the highly blessed and puissant Krishna, O<br>Yudhishthira, once again created from his mouth a century of foremost<br>Brahmanas. From his two arms, he created a century of Kshatriyas, and<br>from his thighs a century of Vaisyas. Then, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>Kesava created from his two feet a century of Sudras. Possessed of great<br>ascetic merit, the slayer of Madhu, having thus created the four orders<br>of men, made Dhatri (Brahman) the lord and ruler of all created beings.<br>Of immeasurable effulgence, Brahman became also the expositor of the<br>knowledge of the Vedas. And Kesava made him, called Virupaksha, the ruler<br>of the spirits and ghosts and of those female beings called the Matrikas<br>(mothers). And he made Yama the ruler of the Pitris and of all sinful<br>men.[706] The Supreme Soul of all creatures also made Kuvera the lord of<br>all treasures. He then created Varuna the lord of waters and governor of<br>all aquatic animals. The puissant Vishnu made Vasava the chief of all the<br>deities. In those times, men lived as long as they chose to live, and<br>were without any fear of Yama. Sexual congress, O chief of the Bharatas,<br>was then not necessary for perpetuating the species. In those days<br>offspring were begotten by flat of the will. In the age that followed,<br>viz., Treta, children were begotten by touch alone. The people of that<br>age even, O monarch, were above the necessity of sexual congress. It was<br>in the next age, viz., Dwapara, that the practice of sexual congress<br>originated, O king, to prevail among men. In the Kali age, O monarch, men<br>have come to marry and live in pairs.<br><br>"I have now told thee of the supreme Lord of all creatures. He is also<br>called the Ruler of all and everything. I shall now, O son of Kunti,<br>speak to thee about the sinful creatures of the earth. Listen to me.[707]<br>Those men, O king, are born in the southern region and are called<br>Andrakas, Guhas, Pulindas, Savaras, Chuchukas, Madrakas.[708] Those that<br>are born in the northern region, I shall also mention. They are Yamas,<br>Kamvojas, Gandharas, Kiratas and Barbaras. All of them, O sire, are<br>sinful, and move on this Earth, characterised by practices similar to<br>those of Chandalas and ravens and vultures. In the Krita age, O sire,<br>they were nowhere on earth. It is from the Treta that they have had their<br>origin and began to multiply, O chief of Bharata's race. When the<br>terrible period came, joining Treta and the Dwapara, the Kshatriyas,<br>approaching one another, engaged themselves in battle.[709]<br><br>"Thus, O chief of Kuru's race, this universe was started into birth by<br>the high-souled Krishna. That observer of all the worlds, viz., the<br>celestial Rishi Narada, has said that Krishna is the Supreme God.[710]<br>Even Narada, O king, admits the supremacy of Krishna and his eternity, O<br>mighty-armed chief of Bharata's race.[711] Thus, O mighty-armed one, is<br>Kesava of unvanquishable prowess. That lotus-eyed one, is not a mere man.<br>He is inconceivable.'"
