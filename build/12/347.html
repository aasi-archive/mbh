                            Vaisampayana said, 'Having heard these words of Nara and Narayana, the<br>Rishi Narada became filled with devotion towards the Supreme Being.<br>Indeed, with his whole soul he devoted himself to Narayana. Having<br>resided for a full thousand years in the retreat of Nara and 'Narayana,<br>having beheld the immutable Hari, and heard the excellent discourse<br>having Narayana for its topic, the celestial Rishi repaired to his own<br>retreat on the breast of Himavat, Those foremost of ascetics viz., Nara<br>and Narayana, however continued to reside in their delightful retreat of<br>Vadari, engaged in the practice of the severest austerities. Thou art<br>born in the race of the Pandavas. Thou art of immeasurable energy. O<br>perpetuator of the race of the Pandavas, having listened to this<br>discourse on Narayana from the beginning, thou hast certainly been<br>cleansed of all thy sins and thy soul has been sanctified. His is neither<br>this world nor the world hereafter, O best of kings, who hates instead of<br>loving and reverencing the immutable Hari. The ancestors of that person<br>who hates Narayana, who is the foremost of deities, and is otherwise<br>called Hari, sink into hell for eternity. O tiger among men, Vishnu is<br>the soul of all beings. How, then, can Vishnu be hated, for in hating him<br>one would hate one's own self. He who is our preceptor, viz., the Rishi<br>Vyasa, the son of Gandhavati, has himself recited this discourse unto us<br>on the glory of Narayana, that glory which is the highest and which is<br>immutable. I heard it from him and have recited it to thee exactly as I<br>heard it, O sinless one. This cult, with its mysteries and its abstract<br>of details, was obtained by Narada, O king, from that Lord of the<br>universe, viz., Narayana himself. Even such are the particulars of this<br>great cult. I have, before this, O foremost of kings, explained it to<br>thee in the Hari-Gita, with a brief reference to its ordinances.[1892]<br>Know that the Island-born Krishna, otherwise called Vyasa, is Narayana on<br>Earth. Who else than he, O tiger among kings, could compile such a<br>treatise as the Mahabharata? Who else than that puissant Rishi could<br>discourse upon the diverse kinds of duties and cults for the observance<br>and adoption of men? Thou hast resolved upon performing a great<br>sacrifice. Let that sacrifice of thine proceed as determined by thee.<br>Having listened to the diverse kinds of duties and cults, let thy<br>Horse-sacrifice go on."<br><br>Sauti continued, That best of kings, having heard this great discourse,<br>began all those rites that are laid down in the ordinance, for the<br>completion of his great sacrifice. Questioned by thee, O Saunaka, I have<br>duly recited to thee and all these Rishis that are denizens of the<br>Naimisha forest, that great discourse having Narayana for its topic.<br>Formerly Narada had recited it to my preceptor in the hearing of many<br>Rishis and the sons of Pandu and in the presence of Krishna and Bhishma<br>also.[1893] The Supreme deity Narayana is the Lord of all the foremost of<br>Rishis, and of the three worlds. He is the upholder of Earth herself of<br>vast proportions. He is the receptacle of the Srutis and of the attribute<br>of humility. He Is the great receptacle of all those ordinances that<br>should be practised for attaining to tranquillity of heart, as also of<br>all those that go by the name of Yama. He is always accompanied by the<br>foremost of regenerate persons. Let that great deity be thy refuge. Hari<br>ever does what is agreeable and beneficial to the denizens of heaven. He<br>is always the slayer of such Asuras (as become troublesome to the three<br>worlds). He is the receptacle of penances. He is possessed of great fame.<br>He is the slayer of the Daityas known by the name of Madhu and Kaitabha.<br>He is the ordainer of the ends that are attained to by persons acquainted<br>with and observant of scriptural and other duties. He dispels the fears<br>of all persons. He takes the foremost of those offerings that are<br>dedicated in sacrifices. He is thy refuge and protection. He is endued<br>with attributes. He is freed from attributes. He is endued with a<br>quadruple form. He shares the merits arising from the dedication of tanks<br>and the observance of similar religious rites. Unvanquished and possessed<br>of great might, it is He that always ordains the end approachable by the<br>Soul alone, of Rishis of righteous deeds. He is the witness of the<br>worlds. He is unborn. He is the one ancient Purusha. Endued with the<br>complexion of the Sun, He is the Supreme Lord, and he is the refuge of<br>all. Do all of you bow your heads unto Him since He who sprang from the<br>waters (viz., Narayana himself) bends his head unto Him.[1894] He is the<br>origin of the universe. He is that Being who is called Amrita. He is<br>minute. He is the refuge upon whom all things depend. He is the one Being<br>to whom the attribute of immutability attaches. The Sankhyas and Yogins,<br>of restrained souls, hold Him who is eternal in their understandings.
