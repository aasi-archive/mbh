                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hadst referred to the dispute between Time,<br>Mrityu, Yama, Ikshvaku, and a Brahmana. It behoveth thee to narrate the<br>story in full.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In connection with this subject that I am discoursing<br>upon, is cited the old history of what transpired between Surya's son<br>Ikshvaku and a certain Brahmana, and Time and Mrityu. Listen to me as to<br>what occurred, and what was the conversation that took place between<br>them, and the place where it happened. There was a certain Brahmana of<br>great fame and pious behaviour. He was a Reciter. Possessed of great<br>wisdom, he was conversant with the six Angas (of the Vedas). He was of<br>the Kusika race and son of Pippalada.[634] He acquired (by his<br>austerities) spiritual insight into the Angas.[635] Residing at the foot<br>of Himavat, he was devoted to the Vedas. Silently reciting the Gayatri<br>composition, he practised severe austerities for attaining to Brahma. A<br>thousand years passed over his head while he was engaged in the<br>observance of vows and fasts. The goddess (of Gayatri or Savitri) showed<br>herself to him and said, 'I am gratified with thee.' Continuing to recite<br>the sacred mantra, the Brahmana remained silent and spoke not a word to<br>the goddess. The goddess felt compassion for him and became highly<br>gratified. Then that progenitrix of the Vedas applaud that recitation in<br>which the Brahmana had been engaged. After finishing his recitation (for<br>that day) the Brahmana stood up and, bending his head, prostrated himself<br>before the goddess's feet. The righteous-souled Reciter, addressing the<br>goddess, said, 'By good luck, O goddess, thou hast been gratified with me<br>and shown thyself to me. If, indeed, thou art gratified with me, the boon<br>I ask is that my heart may take pleasure in act of recitation.'<br><br>"Savitri said, 'What dost thou ask, O regenerate Rishi? What wish of<br>thine shall I accomplish? Tell me, O foremost of Reciters, everything<br>will be as thou wishest.' Thus addressed by the goddess, the Brahmana,<br>conversant with duties, replied, saying, 'Let my wish about continuing my<br>recitations go on increasing every moment. Let also, O auspicious<br>goddess, the absorption of my mind into Samadhi be more complete.' The<br>goddess sweetly said, 'Let it be as thou wishest.' Desiring to do good to<br>the Brahmana, the goddess once again addressed him, saying, 'Thou shalt<br>not have to go to hell, i.e., thither where great Brahmanas go. Thou<br>shalt go into the region of Brahma which is uncreate and free from every<br>fault. I go hence, but that which thou hast asked me shall happen.[636]<br>Go on reciting with restrained soul and rapt attention. The god Dharma<br>will in person come to thee. Time, Mrityu. and Yama also will all<br>approach thy presence. There will be a dispute here between them and thee<br>on a question of morality.'<br><br>'Bhishma continued, 'Having said these words, the goddess went back to<br>her own abode. The Brahmana. continued engaged in recitation for a<br>thousand celestial years. Restraining wrath, and always controlling self,<br>he passed his time, firmly devoting himself to truth and freed from<br>malice. Upon the completion of his observance by the intelligent<br>Brahmana, Dharma, gratified with him, showed his person unto that<br>regenerate individual.'<br><br>'Dharma said, 'O regenerate one, behold me who am Dharma. I have come<br>here for seeing thee. Thou hast won the reward of this recitation in<br>which thou hadst been engaged. Listen to ma as to what that reward is.<br>Thou hast won all the regions of felicity which appertain to either gods<br>or men. O good man, thou shalt ascend above all the abodes of the<br>deities. O ascetic, cast off thy vital breaths then, and go unto whatever<br>regions thou pleasest. By casting off thy body thou wilt win many regions<br>of felicity.'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'What business have I with those regions of felicity<br>of which thou speakest? O Dharma, go whithersoever thou pleasest. I will<br>not, O puissant lord, cast off this body which is subject to much<br>happiness and misery.'<br><br>"Dharma said, 'Thy body, O foremost of ascetics, should certainly be cast<br>off. Do thou ascend to heaven, O Brahmana! Or, tell us what else should<br>please thee, O sinless one!'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'I do not, O puissant lord, wish to reside in heaven<br>itself without this body of mine. Leave me, O Dharma! I have no desire to<br>go to heaven itself without my own body.'<br><br>"Dharma said, 'Without (thus) setting thy heart on thy body, cast it off<br>and be happy Go into regions that are free from the attribute of Passion.<br>Indeed, going thither, thou shalt never have to feel any misery.'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'O highly-blessed one, I take great pleasure in<br>recitation. What need have I for those eternal regions of which thou<br>speakest? Indeed, O puissant lord, I do not desire to go to heaven with<br>even this body of mine.'<br><br>"Dharma said, 'If thou dost not wish to cast off thy body, behold, O<br>regenerate one, there is Time, and there is Mrityu, and there is Yama,<br>who are all approaching thee!'<br><br>'Bhishma continued, 'After Dharma had said this, Vivaswat's son (Yama),<br>Time, and Mrityu,&#8212;the trio (who snatch away all creatures from the<br>earth), approached that Brahmana, O blessed king, and addressed him thus.'<br><br>"Yama said, 'I am Yama. I say unto thee that a high reward awaits thee<br>for these well-performed penances of thine, and for this pious conduct<br>that thou hast observed.'<br><br>"Time said, 'Thou hast won a high reward which is, indeed, commensurate<br>with this course of recitation that thou hast finished. The time is come<br>for thee to ascend to heaven.. I am Time and I have come to thee.'<br><br>"Mrityu said, 'O thou that art conversant with righteousness, know me for<br>Mrityu herself in her proper form. I have come to thee in person, urged<br>by Time, for bearing thee hence, O Brahmana.'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'Welcome to Surya's son, to Time possessed of high<br>soul, to Mrityu, and to Dharma! What shall I accomplish for you all.<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'In that meeting, the Brahmana gave them water to<br>wash their feet, and the usual articles of the Arghya. Highly gratified,<br>he then addressed them, saying, 'What shall I do for you all by exerting<br>my own might?' Just at that time, 01 monarch, (king) Ikshvaku, who had<br>set out on a sojourn to holy waters and shrines, came to that spot where<br>those deities had been assembled together. 'The royal sage Ikshvaku bowed<br>his head and worshipped them all. That best of kings then enquired after<br>the welfare of all of them. The Brahmana gave the king a seat, as also<br>water to wash his feet, and the usual Arghya. Having next made the usual<br>enquiries of courtesy, he said, 'Thou art welcome, O great monarch! Tell<br>me all this thy wishes! Let thy noble self tell me what I shall have to<br>accomplish for thee by putting forth my might.'<br><br>"The king said, 'I am a king. Thou art a Brahmana in the observance of<br>the six well-known duties. (1 cannot ask), I will give thee some wealth.<br>That is well-known. Tell me how much I shall give thee.'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'There are two kinds of Brahmanas, O monarch!<br>Morality of righteousness also is of two kinds; addiction to work, and<br>abstention from work. As regards myself, I have abstained from acceptance<br>of gifts. Give presents unto them, O, king, that are addicted to the duty<br>of work and acceptance. I shall not, therefore, accept anything in gift.<br>On the other hand, I ask thee, what is for thy good? What, indeed, shall<br>I give thee? Tell me, O foremost of kings, and I shall accomplish it with<br>the aid of my penances.'<br><br>"The king said, 'I am a Kshatriya. I do not know how to say the word<br>'Give.' The only thing, O best of regenerate persons, that we can say (by<br>way of asking) is Give (us) battle.'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'Thou art content with the observance of the duties<br>of thy order. Similarly, I am content with the duties of mine, O king!<br>There is, therefore, little difference between us. Do as thou pleasest!'<br><br>"The king said, 'Thou saidst these words first, viz., 'I shall give thee<br>according to my might.' I, therefore, solicit thee, O regenerate one.<br>Give me the fruits of this recitation (which thou hast gone through).'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'Thou wert boasting that thy utterances always<br>solicit battle. Why then dost thou not solicit battle with me?'<br><br>"The king said, 'It has been said that Brahmanas are armed with the<br>thunder of speech, and that Kshatriyas have might of arms. Hence, learned<br>Brahmana, this wordy warfare has set in between thee and me.'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'As regards myself, even that is my resolution today.<br>What shall I give thee according to my might? Tell me, O king of kings,<br>and I shall give thee, having wealth of my own. Do not tarry.'<br><br>"The king said, 'If, indeed, thou desirest to give me anything, then give<br>me the fruits thou hast earned by practising recitation for these<br>thousand years.'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'Take the highest fruit of the recitations I have<br>gone through. Indeed, take half, without any scruple, of that fruit. Or,<br>O king, if thou wishest, take without any scruple the entire fruits of my<br>recitations.'<br><br>"The king said, 'Blessed be thou, I have no need for the fruits of thy<br>recitations which I solicited. Blessings on thy head. I am about to leave<br>thee. Tell me, however, what those fruits are (of thy recitations).'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'I have no knowledge of the fruits I have won. I<br>have, however, given thee those fruits that I have acquired by<br>recitation. These, viz., Dharma and Time, and Yama, and Mrityu, are<br>witnesses (of the act of gift).'<br><br>"The king said, 'What will the fruits, that are unknown, of these thy<br>observances, do for me? If thou dost not tell me what the fruits are of<br>thy recitations, let those fruits be thine, for without doubt I do not<br>wish for them.'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'I will not accept any other utterance (from thee). I<br>have given thee the fruits of my recitations. Let, O royal sage, both thy<br>words and mine become true. As regards my recitations, I never cherished<br>any specific desire to accomplish. How then, O tiger among kings, should<br>I have any knowledge of what the fruits are of those recitations? Thou<br>saidst, 'Give!' I said 'I give!' I shall not falsify these words. Keep<br>the truth. Be calm! If thou request to keep my word, O king, great will<br>be thy sin due to falsehood. O chastiser of foes, it does not become thee<br>to utter what is untrue. Similarly, I dare not falsify what I have<br>uttered. I have, before this, unhesitatingly said, 'I give!' If,<br>therefore, thou art firm in truth, accept my gift. Coming here, O king,<br>thou didst solicit of me the fruits of my recitations. Therefore, take<br>what I have given away, if, indeed, thou art firm in truth. He who is<br>addicted to falsehood had neither this world nor the next. Such a person<br>fails to rescue his (deceased) ancestors. How again shall he succeed in<br>doing good to his (unborn) progeny? The rewards of sacrifices and gifts,<br>as also of fasts and religious observances, are not so efficacious in<br>rescuing (a person from evil and hell) as Truth, O bull among men, in<br>both this and the next world. All the penances that have been undergone<br>by thee and all those that thou wilt undergo in the future for hundreds<br>and thousands of years do not possess efficacy greater than that of<br>Truth. Truth is one un deteriorating Brahma. Truth is the one<br>undeteriorating Penance. Truth is the one undeteriorating sacrifice.<br>Truth is the one undeteriorating Veda. Truth is awake in the Vedas. The<br>fruits attached to Truth have been said to be the highest. From Truth<br>arise Righteousness and Self-restraint. Everything rests on Truth. Truth<br>is the Vedas and their branches. Truth is Knowledge. Truth is the<br>Ordinance. Truth is the observance of vows and fasts. Truth is the<br>Primeval Word Om. Truth is the origin of creatures. Truth is their<br>progeny. It is by Truth that the Wind moves. It is by Truth that the Sun<br>gives heat. It is by Truth that Fire burns. It is on Truth that Heaven<br>rests. Truth is Sacrifice, Penance, Vedas, the utterance of Samans,<br>Mantras, and Saraswati. It hath been heard by us that once on a time<br>Truth and all religious observances were placed on a pair of scales. When<br>both were weighed, that scale on which Truth was, seen to be heavier.<br>There is Truth where Righteousness is. Everything increaseth through<br>Truth. Why, O king, dost thou wish to do an act that is stained with<br>falsehood? Be firm in Truth. Do not act falsely, O monarch! Why wouldst<br>thou falsify thy words 'Give (me),' which thou hast uttered? If thou<br>refusest, O monarch, to accept the fruits that I have given thee of my<br>recitations, thou shalt then have to wander over the world, fallen away<br>from Righteousness! That person who does not give after having promised,<br>and he also that does not accept after having solicited, are both stained<br>with falsehood. It behoveth thee, therefore, not to falsify thy own<br>words.'<br><br>"The king said, 'To fight and protect (subjects) are the duties of<br>Kshatriyas. It is said that Kshatriyas are givers (of presents). How then<br>shall I take anything from thee (in gift)?'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'I never insisted on thee, O king (for accepting<br>anything from me in the first instance). I did not seek thy house.<br>Thyself, coming here, didst solicit me. Why then dost thou not take?'<br><br>"Dharma said, 'Know ye both that I am Dharma himself. Let there be no<br>dispute between you. Let the Brahmana become endued with the reward<br>attaching to gift, and let the monarch also obtain the merit of Truth.'<br><br>"Heaven said, 'Know, O great king, that I am Heaven's self in my embodied<br>form, come hither in person. Let this dispute between you cease. You are<br>both equal in respect of the merit or rewards earned.'<br><br>"The king said, 'I have no use with Heaven. Go, O Heaven, to the place<br>you have come from. If this learned Brahmana desires to repair to thee,<br>let him take the rewards that I have won (by my acts in life).'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'In my younger days I had, through ignorance,<br>stretched my hand (for acceptance of gifts). At present, however, I<br>recite the Gayatri, observing the duty of abstention.[637] Why dost thou,<br>O king, tempt me thus, me who have for a long time observed the duty of<br>abstention? I shall myself do what my duty is. I do not wish to have any<br>share of the rewards won by thee, O monarch! I am devoted to penances and<br>to study of the Vedas, and I have abstained from acceptance.'<br><br>"The king said, 'If, O Brahmana, thou art really to give me the excellent<br>reward of thy recitation, then let half that reward be mine, thyself<br>taking at the same time half the reward that I myself have won by my<br>acts. Brahmanas are engaged in the duty of acceptance. Persons born in<br>the royal order are engaged in the duty of giving. If thou art not<br>unaware of the duties (laid down for both the orders), let our fruits be<br>equal (according to the suggestion I have made). Or, if thou dost not<br>wish to be my equal in respect of our rewards, take then the whole of the<br>rewards that I may have won. Do take the merit I have won, if thou<br>wishest to show me grace.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'At this time, two individuals of very ungainly<br>aspect came there. Each had his arm upon the other's shoulder; both were<br>ill-dressed. They said these words, 'Thou owest me nothing. I really owe<br>thee. If we dispute in this way, here is the king who ruleth individuals.<br>I say truly, thou owest me nothing! Thou speakest falsely. I do owe thee<br>a debt. Both of them, waxing very hot in dispute, then addressed the<br>king, saying, 'See, O monarch, that none of us may become stained with<br>sin.'<br><br>"Virupa said, 'I woe my companion, Vikrita, O monarch, the merits of the<br>gift of a cow. I am willing to pay off that debt. This Vikrita, however,<br>refuses to take repayment.'[638]<br><br>"Vikrita said, 'This Virupa, O monarch, oweth me nothing. He speaks a<br>falsehood with the appearance of truth, O king.'<br><br>"The king said, "Tell me, O Virupa, what is that which thou owest thy<br>friend here. It is my resolution to hear thee and then do what is proper.'<br><br>"Virupa said, 'Hear attentively, O king, all the circumstances in detail,<br>about how I owe my companion, viz., this Vikrita, O ruler of men. This<br>Vikrita had, in bygone days, for the sake of winning merit, O sinless<br>one, given away an auspicious cow, O royal sage, unto a Brahmana devoted<br>to penances as the study of the Vedas. Going unto him, O king, I begged<br>of him the reward of that act. With a pure heart, Vikrita made a gift to<br>me of that reward. I then, for my purification, did some good acts. I<br>also purchased two kapila cows with calves, both of which used to yield<br>large quantities of milk. I then made a present, according to due rites<br>and with proper devotion, of those two cows unto a poor Brahmana living<br>by the Unchha[639] method. Having formerly accepted the gift from my<br>companion, I desire, O lord, even here, to give him return twice the<br>reward![640] The circumstances being such, O tiger among men, who amongst<br>us two shall be innocent and who guilty (according to your judgment)?<br>Disputing with each other about this, we have both come to thee, O<br>monarch! Whether thou judgest rightly or wrongly, establish both of us in<br>peace. If this my companion does not wish to take from me in return a<br>gift equal to what he gave me, thou shalt have to judge patiently and set<br>us both on the right track.'<br><br>"The king said, 'Why do you not accept payment that is sought to be made<br>of the debt that is owing to thee? Do not delay, but accept payment of<br>what thou knowest is thy due.'<br><br>"Vikrita said, 'This one says that he owes me. I say unto him that what I<br>gave I gave away. He doth not, therefore, owe me anything. Let him go<br>whithersoever he wishes.'<br><br>"The king said, 'He is ready to give thee. Thou., however, art unwilling<br>to take. This does not seem proper to me. I think that thou deservest<br>punishment for this. There is little doubt in this.'<br><br>"Vikrita said, 'I made a gift to him, O royal sage! How can I take it<br>back? If I am guilty in this, do thou pronounce the punishment, O<br>puissant one.'<br><br>"Virupa said, 'If thou refusest to take when I am ready to give, this<br>king will certainly punish thee, for he is an upholder of justice.'<br><br>"Vikrita said, 'Solicited by him I gave him what was my own. How shall I<br>now retake that? Thou mayst go away. Thou hast my leave.'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'Thou hast heard, O king, the words of these two. Do<br>thou take without scruple that which I have pledged myself to give thee.'<br><br>"The king said, 'This matter is, indeed, as deep (in importance) as an<br>unfathomable pit. How will the pertinacity of this Reciter end? If I do<br>not accept what has been given by this Brahmana, how shall I avoid being<br>stained with a great sin?' The royal sage then said unto the two<br>disputants, 'Go ye both, having won your respective objects. I should see<br>that kingly duties, vested in me, may not become futile. It is settled<br>that kings should observe the duties laid down for them. To my<br>misfortune, however, the course of duties prescribed for Brahmanas has<br>possessed my wretched self.'[641]<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'Accept, O king! I owe thee. Thou didst solicit it,<br>and I also have become pledged (to give thee). If, however, thou refuse<br>to take, O monarch, I shall without doubt curse thee.'<br><br>"The king said, 'Fie on kingly duties, the settled conclusion about the<br>operation of which is even such. I should, however, take what thou<br>givest, for only this reason, viz., rendering the two courses of duty<br>exactly equal.[642] This is my hand, that was never before (stretched<br>forth for acceptance of gifts), is now stretched forth (for acceptance as<br>also) for giving away. Give me what thou owest me.'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'If I have won any fruits by reciting the Gayatri,<br>accept them all.'<br><br>"The king said, 'These drops of water, behold, O foremost of Brahmanas,<br>have fallen upon my hand. I also desire to give thee. Accept my gift. Let<br>there be equality between us (through thy accepting my gift as I have<br>accepted thine).'<br><br>"Virupa said, 'Know, O king, that we two are Desire and Wrath. It hath<br>been by us that thou hast been induced to act in this way. Thou hast made<br>a gift in return to the Brahmana. Let there be equality between thee and<br>this regenerate person in respect of regions&#8212;of felicity in the next<br>world. This Vikrita really does not owe me anything. We appealed to thee<br>for thy own sake. Time, Dharma, Mrityu, and we two, have examined<br>everything about thee, here in thy very presence, by producing this<br>friction between thee and that Brahmana. Go now, as thou choosest, to<br>those regions of felicity which thou hast won by means of thy deeds.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'I have now told thee how Reciters obtain the fruits<br>(of their recitation) and what, indeed, is their end, what the spot, and<br>what the regions, that a Reciter may win. A Reciter of Gayatri goes to<br>the supreme god Brahman, or repairs to Agni or enters the region of<br>Surya. If he sports there in his (new) energetic form, then stupefied by<br>such attachment, he catches the attributes of those particular<br>regions.[643] The same becomes the case with him if he goes to Soma, or<br>Vayu, or Earth, or Space. The fact is, he dwells in all these, with<br>attachment, and displays the attributes peculiar to those regions. If,<br>however, he goes to those regions after having freed himself from<br>attachments, and feels a. mistrust (respecting the felicity he enjoys)<br>and wishes for That Which is Supreme and Immutable, he then enters even<br>That. In that case he attains to the ambrosia of ambrosia, to a state<br>free from desire and destitute of separate consciousness. He becomes<br>Brahma's self freed from the influence of opposites, happy, tranquil, and<br>without pain.[644] Indeed, he attains to, that condition which is free<br>from pain, which is tranquillity's self, which is; called Brahma, whence<br>there is no return, and which is styled the One and Immutable. He becomes<br>freed from the four means of apprehension,[645] the six conditions, and<br>also the other six and ten attributes.[646] Transcending the Creator<br>(Brahman), he attains to absorption into the One Supreme Soul. Or, if<br>under the influence of attachments, he wishes not for such absorption,<br>but desires to have a separate existence as dependent on that Supreme<br>Cause of everything, then obtains the fruition of everything for which he<br>cherishes a wish. Or, if he looks (with aversion) upon all regions of<br>felicity, which have been (as previously stated) called hells, he then,<br>driving off desire and freed from everything, enjoys supreme felicity<br>even in those very regions.[647] Thus, O monarch, I have discoursed to<br>thee about the end attained by Reciters. I have told thee everything.<br>What else thou wishest to hear?'"
