                            "Bhishma said, 'Having once more assumed his proper form, the dog became<br>very cheerless. The Rishi, reproving him, drove the sinful creature from<br>his hermitage. An intelligent king should, guided by this precedent,<br>appoint servants, each fit for the office assigned to him, and exercise<br>proper supervision over them, having first ascertained their<br>qualifications in respect of truthfulness and purity, sincerity, general<br>disposition, knowledge of the scripture, conduct, birth, self-restraint,<br>compassion, strength, energy, dignity, and forgiveness. A king should<br>never take a minister without first having examined him. If a king<br>gathers round him persons of low birth, he can never be happy. A person<br>of high birth, even if persecuted without any fault by his royal master,<br>never sets his heart, in consequence of the respectability of his blood,<br>upon injuring his master. An individual, however, that is mean and of low<br>birth, having obtained even great affluence from his connection with some<br>honest man, becomes an enemy of the latter if only he is reproached in<br>words.[351] A minister should be possessed of high birth and strength; he<br>should be forgiving and self-restrained, and have all his sense under<br>control; he should be free from the vice of rapacity, contented with his<br>just acquisitions, delighted with the prosperity of his master and<br>friends, conversant with the requirements of place and time, ever<br>employed in attaching men to himself or his master by doing good offices<br>to them, always attentive to his duties, desiring the good of his master,<br>always heedful, faithful in the discharge of his own duties., a thorough<br>master of the art of war and peace, conversant with the king's<br>requirements in respect of the great aggregate of three, beloved by both<br>the citizens and the inhabitants of the provinces, acquainted with all<br>kinds of battle-array for piercing and breaking the enemy's ranks,<br>competent to inspire the forces of his master with cheerfulness and joy,<br>capable of reading signs and gestures, acquainted with all requirements<br>in respect of march, skilled in the art of training elephants, free from<br>pride, confident of his own powers, clever in the transaction of<br>business, always doing what is right, of righteous conduct, surrounded by<br>righteous friends, of sweet speech, possessed of agreeable features,<br>capable of leading men, well-versed in policy, possessed of<br>accomplishments, energetic in action, active, possessed of ingenuity, of<br>a sweet temper, modest in address, patient, brave, rich, and capable of<br>adapting his measures to the requirement of place and time. That king who<br>succeeds in obtaining such a minister can never be humiliated or<br>overpowered by any one. Indeed, his kingdom gradually spreads over the<br>earth like the light of the moon. A king, again, who is conversant with<br>the scriptures, who regards righteousness to be superior to everything,<br>who is always engaged in protecting his subjects, and who is possessed of<br>the following virtues, obtains the love of all. He should be patient,<br>forgiving, pure in conduct, severe when the occasion requires it<br>acquainted with the efficacy of exertion, respectful in his behaviour<br>towards all his seniors, possessed of a knowledge of the scriptures,<br>ready to listen to the instructions and counsels of those that are<br>competent to instruct and give counsel, capable of judging correctly amid<br>different or opposite courses of action suggested to him, intelligent, of<br>a retentive memory, ready to do what is just, self-restrained, always<br>sweet-speeched, forgiving even unto enemies, practising charity<br>personally, possessed of faith, of agreeable features, ready to extend<br>the hand of succour to persons plunged in distress, possessed of<br>ministers that always seek his good, free from the fault of egoism, never<br>without a wife,[352] and undisposed to do anything with haste. He should<br>always reward his ministers when they achieve anything signal. He should<br>love those that are devoted to him. Avoiding idleness, he should always<br>attract men to himself by doing good to them. His face should always be<br>cheerful. He should always be attentive to the wants of his servants and<br>never give way to wrath. He should, besides, be magnanimous. Without<br>lying aside the lord of chastisement, he should wield it with propriety.<br>He should make all men about him act righteously. Having spies for his<br>eyes, he should always supervise the concerns of his subjects, and should<br>be conversant in all matters connected with virtue and wealth. A king<br>that is possessed of these hundred qualifications earns the love of all.<br>Every ruler should strive to be such. The king should also, O monarch,<br>search for good warriors (to enlist in his army) that should all be<br>possessed of the necessary qualifications, for aiding him in protecting<br>his kingdom. A king that desires his own advancement should never<br>disregard his army. That king whose soldiers are brave in battle,<br>grateful, and versed in the scriptures, whose army consists of<br>foot-soldiers conversant with the treatises on religion and duty, whose<br>elephant-warriors are fearless, whose car-warriors are skilled in their<br>own mode of fighting and well-versed in shooting arrows and in wielding<br>other weapons, succeeds in subjugating the whole earth. That king who is<br>always employed in attaching all men to himself, who is ready for<br>exertion, who is rich in friends and allies, becomes the foremost of<br>rulers. A king who has succeeded in attaching all men unto himself, may,<br>O Bharata, with the aid of even a thousand horsemen of courage, succeed<br>in conquering the whole earth.'"
