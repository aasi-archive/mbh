                            "Bhishma said, 'These two, viz., one that provides for the future, and<br>one possessed of presence of mind, always enjoy happiness. The man of<br>procrastination, however, is lost. In this connection, listen attentively<br>to the following excellent story of a procrastinating person in the<br>matter of settling his course of action. In a lake that was not very deep<br>and which abounded with fishes, there lived three Sakula fishes that were<br>friends and constant companions. Amongst those three one had much<br>forethought and always liked to provide for what was coming. Another was<br>possessed of great presence of mind. The third was procrastinating. One<br>day certain fishermen coming to that lake began to bale out its waters to<br>a lower ground through diverse outlets. Beholding the water of the lake<br>gradually decreasing, the fish that had much foresight, addressing his<br>two companions on that occasion of danger, said, 'A great danger is about<br>to overtake all the aquatic creatures living in this lake. Let us<br>speedily go to some other place before our path becomes obstructed. He<br>that resists future evil by the aid of good policy, never incurs serious<br>danger. Let my counsels prevail with you. Let us all leave this place'<br>That one amongst the three who was procrastinating then answered, 'It is<br>well said. There is, however, no need of such haste. This is my<br>deliberate opinion.' Then the other fish, who was noted for presence of<br>mind, addressed his procrastinating companion and said, 'When the time<br>for anything comes, I never fail to provide for it according to policy.'<br>Hearing the answers of his two companions, he of great forethought and<br>considerable intelligence immediately set out by a current and reached<br>another deep lake. The fishermen, Seeing that all the water had been<br>baled out, shut in the fishes that remained, by diverse means. Then they<br>began to agitate the little water that remained, and as they began to<br>catch the fish, the procrastinating Sakula was caught with many others.<br>When the fisherman began to tie to a long string the fishes they had<br>caught, the Sakula who was noted for presence of mind thrust himself into<br>the company of those that had been so tied and remained quietly among<br>them, biting the string, for he thought that he should do it to give the<br>appearance of being caught. The fishermen believed that all the fishes<br>attached to the string had been caught. They then removed them to a piece<br>of deep water for washing them. Just at that time the Sakula noted for<br>presence of mind, leaving the string, quickly escaped. That fish,<br>however, who had been procrastinating, foolish and senseless and without<br>intelligence as he was, and, therefore, unable to escape, met with death.<br><br>"'Thus every one meets with destruction, like the procrastinating fish,<br>who from want of intelligence cannot divine the hour of danger. That man,<br>again, who regarding himself clever does not seek his own good in proper<br>time, incurs great danger like the Sakula who had presence of mind. Hence<br>these two only, viz., he that has much forethought and he that has<br>presence of mind, succeed in obtaining happiness. He, however, that is<br>procrastinating meets with destruction. Diverse are the divisions of<br>time, such as Kashtha, Kala, Muhurta, day, night, Lava, month, fortnight,<br>the six seasons, Kalpa, year. The divisions of the earth are called<br>place. Time cannot be seen. As regards the success of any object or<br>purpose, it is achieved or not achieved according to the manner in which<br>the mind is set to think of it. These two, viz., the person of<br>forethought and the person of presence of mind, have been declared by the<br>Rishis to be the foremost of men in all treatises on morality and profit<br>and in those dealing with emancipation. One, however, that does<br>everything after reflection and scrutiny, one that avails oneself of<br>proper means for the accomplishment of one's objects, always succeeds in<br>achieving much. Those again that act with due regard to time and place<br>succeed in winning results better than the mere man of foresight and the<br>man of presence of mind.'"
