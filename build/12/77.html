                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Of whose wealth, O bull of Bharata's race, is the<br>king regarded to be the lord? And what conduct also should the king<br>adopt? Discourse to me on this, O grandsire.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The Vedas declare that the king is the lord of the wealth<br>that belongs to all persons except Brahmanas, as also of those Brahmanas<br>that are not observant of their proper duties. The king should not spare<br>those Brahmanas that are not observant of their duties. The righteous say<br>that this is the ancient custom of kings. That king, O monarch, in whose<br>dominion a Brahmana becomes a thief, is regarded to be the author of that<br>misdeed. It is the king that becomes sinful on that account. In<br>consequence of such a circumstance, kings regard themselves to be worthy<br>of reproach. All righteous kings, therefore, provide Brahmanas with the<br>means of support. In this connection is cited the old narrative of the<br>speech made by the king of the Kaikeyas unto a Rakshasa while the latter<br>was about to abduct him away. Of rigid vows and possessed of Vedic lore,<br>the king of the Kaikeyas, O monarch, while living in the woods, was<br>forcibly seized on a certain occasion by a Rakshasa.'<br><br>"The king said, 'There is no thief in my territories, nor any person of<br>wicked behaviour, nor any one that drinks alcohol. There is no one in my<br>dominions who has not his sacred fire or who does not perform sacrifices.<br>How then hast thou been able to possess my heart? There is no Brahmana in<br>my dominions who is not possessed of learning or who is not observant of<br>vows or who has not drunk Soma. There is no one who has not his sacred<br>fire or who does not perform sacrifices. How then hast thou been able to<br>possess my soul? In my dominions no sacrifice has been performed without<br>completing it by Dakshina. No one in my dominions studies the Vedas who<br>is not observant of vows. How then hast thou been able to possess my<br>soul? The Brahmanas in my kingdom teach, study, sacrifice, officiate at<br>other's sacrifices, give, and receive gifts. All of them are observant of<br>those six acts. The Brahmanas in my kingdom are all devoted to the<br>performance of the duties of their order. Worshipped and provided for,<br>they are mild, and truthful in speech. How then hast thou been able to<br>possess my soul? The Kshatriyas in my kingdom are all devoted to the<br>duties or their order. They never beg but give, and are conversant with<br>truth and virtue. They never teach but study, and perform sacrifices but<br>never officiate at the sacrifices of others. They protect the Brahmanas<br>and never fly from battle. How then hast thou been able to possess my<br>soul? The Vaisyas in my dominion are all observant of the duties of their<br>order. With simplicity and without deceit they derive their sustenance<br>from agriculture, cattle-keeping, and trade. They are all heedful,<br>observant of religious rites and excellent vows, and truthful in speech.<br>They give to guests what is their due, and self-restrained, and pure, and<br>attached to their relative and kinsmen. How then hast thou been able to<br>possess my heart? The Sudras in my kingdom, observant of the duties of<br>their order, humbly and duly serve and wait upon the other three orders<br>without entertaining any malice towards them. How then hast thou been<br>able to possess my heart? I support the helpless and the old, the weak,<br>the ill, and women (without guardians), by supplying them with all their<br>necessaries. How then hast thou been able to possess my heart? I am never<br>an exterminator of the special customs of families and of countries<br>existing duly from days of old. How then hast thou been able to possess<br>my heart? The ascetics in my kingdom are protected and worshipped. They<br>are always honoured and entertained with food. How then hast thou been<br>able to possess my heart? I never eat without feeding others from my<br>dishes. I never go to other people's wives. I never sport or recreate<br>alone. How then hast thou been able to possess my heart? No one in my<br>kingdom who is not a Brahmacharin begs his food, and no one who leads the<br>Bhikshu mode of life desires to be a Brahmacharin. No one who is not a<br>Ritwij pours libations (of clarified butter) upon the sacrificial fire.<br>How then hast thou been able to possess my soul? I never disregard the<br>learned or the old or those that are engaged in penances. When the whole<br>population sleeps, I keep myself awake (for watching and protecting). How<br>then hast thou been able to possess my heart? My priest possesses<br>knowledge of self. He is given to penances, and is conversant with all<br>duties. Possessed of great intelligence, he has the fullest power over my<br>kingdom. By gifts I desire to acquire knowledge, and by truth and the<br>protection of Brahmanas, I desire to attain regions of blessedness in<br>heaven. By service I attach myself to my preceptors, I have no fear of<br>Rakshasas. In my kingdom there are no widows, no wicked Brahmanas, no<br>Brahmana that has fallen away from his duties, no deceitful person, no<br>thief, no Brahmana that officiates in the sacrifices of people for whom<br>he should never officiate, and no perpetrator of sinful deeds. I have no<br>fear of Rakshasas. There is no space in my body, of even two fingers'<br>breadth, that does not bear the scar of a weapon-wound. I always fight<br>for the sake of righteousness. How hast thou been able to possess my<br>heart? The people of my kingdom always invoke blessings upon me in order<br>that I may always be able to protect kine and Brahmanas and perform<br>sacrifices. How then hast thou been able to possess me?'<br><br>"The Rakshasa said, 'Since thou art observant of the duties under all<br>circumstances, therefore, O king of the Kaikeyas, go back to thy abode.<br>Blessed be thou, I leave thee. They, O king of the Kaikeyas, who protect<br>kine and Brahmanas and all their subjects, have nothing to fear from<br>Rakshasas, and much less from sinful persons. Those kings that give the<br>lead to Brahmanas and whose might depends upon that of the Brahmanas, and<br>whose subjects discharge the duties of hospitality, always succeeds in<br>acquiring heaven.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thou shouldst, therefore, protect the Brahmanas.<br>Protected by thee, they will protect thee in return. Their blessings, O<br>king, would surely descend upon kings of righteous behaviour. For the<br>sake of righteousness, those Brahmanas that are not observant of the<br>duties of their order should be chastised and separated (into a distinct<br>class) from their superiors. A king who conducts himself in this way<br>towards the people of his city and the provinces, obtains prosperity here<br>and residence in heaven with Indra.'"
