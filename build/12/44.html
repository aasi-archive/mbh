                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having got back the kingdom, king Yudhishthira of<br>great wisdom and purity, after the ceremony of installation had been<br>over, joining his hands together, addressed the lotus-eyed Krishna of<br>Dasarha's race, saying, 'Through thy grace, O Krishna, through thy policy<br>and might and intelligence and prowess, O tiger among the Yadus, I have<br>got back this ancestral kingdom of mine. O thou of eyes like lotus<br>leaves, I repeatedly bow to thee, O chastiser of foes! Thou hast been<br>called the One only Being. Thou hast been said to be the refuge of all<br>worshippers. The regenerate ones adore thee under innumerable names.[127]<br>Salutations to thee, O Creator of the Universe! Thou art the soul of the<br>Universe and the Universe hath sprung from thee. Thou art Vishnu, thou<br>art Jishnu, thou art Hari, thou art Krishna, thou art Vaikuntha, and thou<br>art the foremost of all beings. Thou hast, as said in the Puranas, taken<br>thy birth seven times in the womb of Aditi. It was thou that tookest<br>birth in the womb of Prishni.[128] The learned say that thou art the<br>three Yugas.[129] All thy achievements are sacred. Thou art the lord of<br>our senses. Thou art the great Lord worshipped in sacrifices. Thou art<br>called the great swan. Thou art three-eyed Sambhu. Thou art One, though<br>known as Vibhu and Damodara. Thou art the great Boar, thou art Fire, thou<br>art the Sun, thou hast the bull for the device on thy banner, and thou<br>hast Garuda also as thy device. Thou art the grinder of hostile hosts,<br>thou art the Being that pervadest every form in the universe and thou art<br>of irresistible prowess. Thou art the foremost of all things, thou art<br>fierce, thou art the generalissimo in battle, thou art the Truth, thou<br>art the giver of food, and thou art Guha (the celestial generalissimo);<br>Thyself unfading, thou causest thy foes to fade and waste. Thou art the<br>Brahmana of pure blood, and thou art those that have sprung from<br>intermixture. Thou art great. Thou walkest on high, thou art the<br>mountains, and thou art called Vrishadarbha and Vrishakapi. Thou art the<br>Ocean, thou art without attributes, thou hast three humps, thou hast<br>three abodes, and thou takest human forms on earth, descending from<br>heaven. Thou art Emperor, thou art Virat, and thou art Swarat.[130] Thou<br>art the Chief of the celestials, and thou art the cause whence the<br>Universe has sprung. Thou art Almighty, thou art existence in every form,<br>thou art without form, thou art Krishna, and thou art fire. Thou art the<br>Creator, thou art the sire of the celestial physicians, thou art (the<br>sage) Kapila, and thou art the Dwarf.[131] Thou art Sacrifice embodied,<br>thou art Dhruva,[132] thou art Garuda, and thou art called Yajnasena.<br>Thou art Sikhandin, thou art Nahusha, and thou art Vabhru. Thou art the<br>constellation Punarvasu extended in the firmament, Thou art exceedingly<br>tawny in hue, thou art the sacrifice known by the name of Uktha, thou art<br>Sushena, thou art the drum (that sends forth its sound on every side).<br>The track of thy car-wheels is light. Thou art the lotus of Prosperity,<br>thou art the cloud called Pushkara, and thou art decked with floral<br>wreaths. Thou art affluent, thou art puissant, thou art the most subtle,<br>and it is thou whom the Vedas describe. Thou art the great receptacle of<br>waters, thou art Brahman, thou art the sacred refuge, and thou knowest<br>the abodes of all. Thou art called Hiranyagarbha, thou art the sacred<br>mantras swadha  and swaha, thou art Kesava. Thou art the cause whence all<br>this hath sprung, and thou art its dissolution. In the beginning it is<br>thou that createst the universe. This universe is under thy control, O<br>Creator of the universe! Salutations to thee, O wielder of Sarnga, discus<br>and sword!' Thus hymned by king Yudhishthira the just in the midst of the<br>court, the lotus-eyed Krishna became pleased. That foremost one of the<br>Yadavas then began to gladden the eldest son of Pandu with many agreeable<br>speeches."
