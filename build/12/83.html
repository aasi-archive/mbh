                            "Yudhishthira said, 'What should be the characteristics, O grandsire, of<br>the legislators, the ministers of war, the courtiers, the generalissimos,<br>and the counsellors of a king!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Such persons as are possessed of modesty, self-restraint,<br>truth, sincerity, and courage to say what is proper, should be thy<br>legislators. They that are always by thy side, that are possessed of<br>great courage, that are of the regenerate caste, possessed of great<br>learning, well pleased with thee, and endued with perseverance in all<br>acts, should, O son of Kunti, be desired by thee for becoming thy<br>ministers of war at all seasons of distress, O Bharata! One who is of<br>high descent, who, treated with honour by thee, always exerts his powers<br>to the utmost on thy behalf, and who will never abandon thee in weal or<br>woe, illness or death, should be entertained by thee as a courtier. They<br>that are of high birth, that are born in thy kingdom, that have wisdom,<br>beauty of form and features, great learning, and dignity of behaviour,<br>and that are, besides, devoted to thee, should be employed as officers of<br>thy army. Persons of tow descent and covetous dispositions, who are cruet<br>and shameless would court thee, O sire, as long as their hands would<br>remain wet.[244] They that are of good birth and good behaviour, that can<br>read all signs and gestures, that are destitute of cruelty, that know<br>what the requirements are of place and time, that always seek the good of<br>their master in all acts, should be appointed as ministers by the king in<br>all his affairs. They that have been won over with gifts of wealth,<br>honours, regardful receptions, and means of procuring felicity, and who<br>on that account may be regarded by thee as persons inclined to benefit<br>thee in all thy affairs, should always be made sharers of thy happiness.<br>They that are unchangeable in conduct, possessed of learning and good<br>behaviour, observant of excellent vows, large-hearted, and truthful in<br>speech, will always be attentive to thy affairs and will never abandon<br>thee, They, on the other hand, that are disrespectable, that are not<br>observant of restraints, that are of wicked souls, and that have fallen<br>away from good practices, should always be compelled by thee to observe<br>all wholesome restraints. When the question is which of two sides should<br>be adopted, thou shouldst not abandon the many for adopting the side of<br>one. When, however, that one person transcends the many in consequence of<br>the possession of many accomplishments, then thou shouldst, for that one,<br>abandon the many. These are regarded as marks of superiority, viz.,<br>prowess, devotion to pursuits that bring fame, and observance of<br>wholesome restraints. He, again, that honours all persons possessed of<br>ability, that never indulges in feelings of rivalry with persons<br>possessed of no merit, that never abandons righteousness from lust or<br>fear or wrath or covetousness, that is adorned with humility, that is<br>truthful in speech and forgiving in temper, that has his soul under<br>control, that has a sense of dignity, and that has been tried in every<br>situation, should be employed by thee as thy counsellor. High descent,<br>purity of blood, forgiveness, cleverness, and purity of soul, bravery,<br>gratefulness, and truth, are, O son of Pritha marks of superiority and<br>goodness. A wise man who conducts himself in this way,[245] succeeds in<br>disarming his very foes of their hostility and converting them into<br>friend. A king that has his soul under restraint, that is possessed of<br>wisdom, and that is desirous of prosperity, should carefully examine the<br>merits and demerits of his ministers. A king desirous of prosperity and<br>of shining in the midst of his contemporaries, should have for ministers<br>persons connected with his trusted friends, possessed of high birth born<br>in his own kingdom, incapable of being corrupted, unstained by adultery<br>and similar vices, well tested, belonging to good families, possessed of<br>learning, sprung from sires and grandsires that held similar offices, and<br>adorned with humility. The king should employ five such persons to look<br>after his affairs as are possessed of intelligence unstained by pride, a<br>disposition that is good, energy, patience, forgiveness, purity, loyalty,<br>firmness, and courage, whose merits and faults have been well tested, who<br>are of mature years, who are capable of bearing burthens, and who are<br>free from deceit. Men that are wise in speech, that are possessed of<br>heroism, that are full of resources under difficulties, that are of high<br>birth, that are truthful, that can read signs, that are free from<br>cruelty, that are conversant with the requirements of place and time, and<br>that desire the good of their masters, should be employed by the king as<br>his ministers in all affairs of the kingdom. One who is bereft of energy<br>and who has been abandoned by friends can never work with perseverance.<br>Such a man, if employed, fails in almost every business. A minister<br>possessed of little learning, even if blessed with high birth and<br>attentive to virtue, profit, and pleasure, becomes incompetent in<br>choosing proper courses of action. Similarly, a person of low descent,<br>even if possessed of great learning, always errs, like a blind man<br>without a guide, in all acts requiring dexterity and foresight. A person,<br>again, who is of infirm purposes, even if possessed of intelligence and<br>learning, and even if conversant with means, cannot long act with<br>success. A man of wicked heart and possessed of no learning may set his<br>hand to work but he fails to ascertain what the results will be of his<br>work. A king should never repose trust on a minister that is not devoted<br>to him. He should, therefore, never disclose his counsels to a minister<br>that is not devoted to him. Such a wicked minister, combining with the<br>other ministers of the king, may ruin his master, like a fire consuming a<br>tree by entering its entrails through the holes in its body with the aid<br>of the wind. Giving way to wrath, a master may one day pull down a<br>servant from his office or reprove him, from rage, in harsh words, and<br>restore him to power again. None but a servant devoted to the master can<br>bear and forgive such treatment. Ministers also become sometime highly<br>offended with their royal masters. That one, however, amongst them, who<br>subdues his wrath from desire of doing good to his master,&#8212;that person<br>who is a sharer with the king of his weal and woe,&#8212;should be consulted<br>by the king in all his affairs. A person who is of crooked heart, even if<br>he be devoted to his master and possessed of wisdom and adorned with.<br>numerous virtues, should never be consulted by the king. One who is<br>allied with foes and who does not regard the interests of the king's<br>subjects, should be known as an enemy. The king should never consult with<br>him. One who is possessed of no learning, who is not pure, who is stained<br>with pride, who pays court to the king's enemies, who indulges in brag,<br>who is unfriendly, wrathful, and covetous should not be consulted by the<br>king. One who is a stranger, even if he be devoted to the king and<br>possessed of great learning, may be honoured by the king and gratified<br>with assignment of the means of sustenance, but the king should never<br>consult him in his affairs. A person whose sire was unjustly banished by<br>royal edict should not be consulted by the king even if the king may have<br>subsequently bestowed honours upon him and assigned to him the means of<br>sustenance. A well-wisher whose property was once confiscated for a<br>slight transgression, even if he be possessed of every accomplishment<br>should not still be consulted by the king. A person possessed of wisdom,<br>intelligence, and learning, who is born within the kingdom, who is pure<br>and righteous in all his acts, deserves to be consulted by the king. One<br>who is endued with knowledge and wisdom, who is acquainted with the<br>dispositions of his friends and foes, who is such a friend of the king as<br>to be his second self, deserves to be consulted. One who is truthful in<br>speech and modest and mild and who is a hereditary servant of the king,<br>deserves to be consulted. One who is contented and honoured, who is<br>truthful and dignified, who hates wickedness and wicked men, who is<br>conversant with policy and the requirements of time, and who is<br>courageous, deserves to be consulted by the king. One who is competent to<br>win over all men by conciliation should be consulted, O monarch, by the<br>king that is desirous of ruling according to the dictates of the science<br>of chastisement. One upon whom the inhabitants of both the capital and<br>the provinces repose confidence for his righteous conduct, who is<br>competent to fight and conversant with the rules of policy, deserves to<br>be consulted by the king. Therefore, men possessed of such qualities, men<br>conversant with the dispositions of all and desirous of achieving high<br>acts, should be honoured by the king and made his ministers. Their number<br>also should not be less than three.[246] Ministers should be employed in<br>observing the laches of their masters, of themselves, of the subjects,<br>and of the foes of their master. The kingdom has its root in the counsels<br>of policy that flow from ministers, and its growth proceeds from the same<br>source. Ministers should act in such a way that the enemies of their<br>master may not be able to detect his laches. On the other hand, when<br>their laches become visible, they should then be assailed. Like the<br>tortoise protecting its limbs by withdrawing them within its shell,<br>ministers should protect their own counsels. They should, even thus,<br>conceal their own laches. Those ministers of a kingdom that succeed in<br>concealing their counsels are said to be possessed of wisdom. Counsels<br>constitute the armour of a king, and the limbs of his subjects and<br>officers. A kingdom is said to have its roots in spies and secret agents,<br>and its strength is said to lie in counsels of policy. If masters and<br>ministers follow each other for deriving support from each other,<br>subduing pride and wrath, and vanity and envy, they may then both become<br>happy. A king should also consult with such ministers as are free from<br>the five kinds of deceit. Ascertaining well, in the first instance, the<br>different opinions of the three amongst them whom he has consulted, the<br>king should, for subsequent deliberation, repair to his preceptor for<br>informing him of those opinions and his own. His preceptor should be a<br>Brahmana well versed in all matters of virtue, profit, and pleasure.<br>Repairing, for such subsequent deliberation, to him, the king should,<br>with collected mind, ask his opinion. When a decision is arrived at after<br>deliberation with him, the king should then, without attachment, carry it<br>out into practice. They that are conversant with the conclusions of the<br>science of consultation say that kings should always hold consultation in<br>this way. Having settled counsels in this way, they should then be<br>reduced to practice, for then they will be able to win over all the<br>subjects. There should be no dwarfs, no humpbacked persons, no one of an<br>emaciated constitution, no one who is lame or blind, no one who is an<br>idiot, no woman, and no eunuch, at the spot where the king holds his<br>consultations. Nothing should move there before or behind, above or<br>below, or in transverse directions. Getting up on a boat, or repairing to<br>an open space destitute of grass or grassy bushes and whence the<br>surrounding land may be clearly seen, the king should hold consultations<br>at the proper time, avoiding faults of speech and gestures.'"
