                            "Parasara said, 'That man who, having obtained this car, viz., his body<br>endued with mind, goes on, curbing with the reins of-knowledge the steeds<br>represented by the objects of the senses, should certainly be regarded as<br>possessed of intelligence. The homage (in the form of devotion to and<br>concentrated meditation on the Supreme) by a person whose mind is<br>dependent on itself and who has cast off the means of livelihood is<br>worthy of high praise,&#8212;that homage, namely, O regenerate one, which is<br>the result of instructions received from one who has succeeded in<br>transcending acts but not obtained from the mutual discussion of men in<br>the same state of progress.[1506] Having obtained the allotted period of<br>life, O king, with such difficulty, one should not diminish it (by<br>indulgence of the senses). On the other hand, man should always exert, by<br>righteous acts for his gradual advancement.[1507] Among the six different<br>colours that Jiva attains at different periods of his existence, he who<br>falls away from a superior colour deserves obloquy and censure. Hence,<br>one that has attained to the result of good acts should conduct oneself<br>in such a way as to avoid all acts stained by the quality of Rajas.[1508]<br>Man attains to a superior colour by righteous acts. Unable to acquire a<br>superior hue, for such acquisition is extremely difficult, a person, by<br>doing sinful acts only slays himself (by sinking into hell and falling<br>down into an inferior colour). All sinful acts that are committed<br>unconsciously or in ignorance are destroyed by penances. A sinful act,<br>however, that is committed knowingly, produces much sorrow. Hence, one<br>should never commit sinful acts which have for their fruit only sorrow.<br>The man of intelligence would never do an act that is sinful in character<br>even if it leads to the greatest advantage, just as a person that is pure<br>would never touch a Chandala.[1509] How miserable is the fruit I see of<br>sinful acts! Through sin the very vision of the sinner becomes perverse,<br>and he confounds his body and its unstable accompaniments with the<br>Soul.[1510] That foolish man who does not succeed in betaking himself to<br>Renunciation in this world becomes afflicted with great grief when he<br>departs to the next world.[1511] An uncoloured cloth, when dirty, can be<br>cleaned, but not a piece of cloth that is dyed with black; even so, O<br>king, listen to me with care, is it the case with sin. That man who,<br>having knowingly committed sin, acts righteously for expiating that sin,<br>has to enjoy and endure the fruits of his good and bad acts<br>separately.[1512] The utterers of Brahma maintain, under the authority of<br>what has been laid down in the Vedas, that all acts of injury committed<br>in ignorance are cancelled by acts of righteousness. A sin, however, that<br>is committed consciously is never cancelled by righteousness. Thus say<br>the regenerate utterers of Brahma who are conversant with the scriptures<br>of Brahmana. As regards myself, my view is that whatever acts are done,<br>be they righteous or sinful, be they done knowingly or otherwise, remain<br>(and are never destroyed unless their fruits are enjoyed or<br>endured).[1513] Whatever acts are done by the mind with full<br>deliberation, produce, according to their grossness or subtility, fruits<br>that are gross or subtile.[1514] Those acts, however, O thou of righteous<br>soul, which are fraught with great injury, if done in ignorance, do<br>without fail produce consequences and even consequences that lead to<br>hell, with this difference that those consequences are disproportionate<br>in point of gravity to the acts that produce them.[1515] As to those acts<br>(of a doubtful or unrighteous nature) that may be done by the deities or<br>ascetics of reputation, a righteous man should never do their like or,<br>informed of them, should never censure them.[1516] That man who,<br>reflecting with his mind, O king, and ascertaining his own ability,<br>accomplishes righteous acts, certainly obtains what is for his benefit.<br>Water poured into an unbaked vessel gradually becomes less and finally<br>escapes altogether. If kept, however, in a baked vessel, it remains<br>without its quantity being diminished. After the same manner, acts done<br>without reflection with the aid of the understanding do not become<br>beneficial; while acts done with judgment remain with undiminished<br>excellence and yield happiness as their result. If into a vessel<br>containing water other water be poured, the water that was originally<br>there increases in quantity; even so all acts done with judgment, be they<br>equitable or otherwise, only add to one's stock of righteousness. A king<br>should subjugate his foes and all who seek to assert their superiority,<br>and he should properly rule and protect his subjects. One should ignite<br>one's sacred fires and pour libations on them in diverse sacrifices, and<br>retiring in the woods into either one's middle or old age, should live<br>there (practising the duties of the two last modes of life). Endued with<br>self-restraint, and possessed of righteous behaviour, one should look<br>upon all creatures as on one's own self. One should again reverence one's<br>superiors. By the practice of truth and of good conduct, O king, one is<br>sure to obtain happiness.'"
