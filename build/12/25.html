                            Vaisampayana said, "Hearing the words of the Island-born Rishi and seeing<br>Dhananjaya angry, Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, saluted Vyasa and made<br>the following answer.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'This earthly sovereignty and the diverse enjoyments<br>(appertaining thereto) fail to give any joy to my heart. On the other<br>hand, this poignant grief (consequent upon the loss of my kinsmen) is<br>eating away its core. Hearing the lamentations of these women who have<br>lost their heroic husbands and children, I fail to attain peace, O<br>sage!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed, the virtuous Vyasa that foremost<br>of all persons conversant with Yoga, possessed of great wisdom and<br>intimately acquainted with the Vedas, said unto Yudhisthira (the<br>following words).<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'No man can acquire anything by his own acts or by<br>sacrifices and worship. No man can give anything to a fellow man. Man<br>acquires everything through Time. The Supreme Ordainer has made the<br>course of Time the means of acquisition. By mere intelligence or study of<br>the scriptures, men, if Time be unfavourable, cannot acquire any earthly<br>possession. Sometimes an ignorant fool may succeed in winning wealth.<br>Time is the efficacious means for the accomplishment of all acts. During<br>times of adversity, neither science, nor incantations, nor drugs, yield<br>any fruits. In times, however, of prosperity, those very things, properly<br>applied, become efficacious and bear success. By Time the winds blow<br>violently: by Time the clouds become rain-charged; by Time tanks become<br>adorned with lotuses of different kinds; by Time trees in the forest<br>become decked with flowers. By Time nights become dark or lighted. By<br>Time the Moon becomes full. If the Time for it does not come, trees do<br>not bear flowers and fruits. If the Time for it does not come, the<br>currents of rivers do not become fierce. Birds and snakes and deer and<br>elephants and other animals never become excited when the Time for it<br>does not come. If the Time for it does not come, women do not conceive.<br>It is with Time that winter, and summer, and the rainy season come. If<br>the Time for it does not come, no one is born and no one dies. If the<br>Time does not come, the infant does not acquire power of speech. If the<br>Time does not come, one does not acquire youth. It is with Time that the<br>seed sown puts forth its sprouts. If the Time does not come, the Sun does<br>not appear above the horizon, nor, when the Time for it does not come,<br>does he repair to the Asta hills. If the Time for it does not come, the<br>Moon does not wax nor wane, nor the ocean, with its high billows, rise<br>and ebb. In this connection is instanced the old story recited, O<br>Yudhishthira, by king Senajit in grief. The irresistible course of Time<br>affects all mortals. All earthly things, ripened by Time, suffer<br>destruction. Some, O king, slay some men. The slayers, again, are slain<br>by others. This is the language of the world. Really, however, no one<br>stays and no one is slain. Some one thinks men slay (their fellow-men).<br>Another thinks men do not slay. The truth is that the birth and<br>destruction of all creatures have been ordained to happen in consequence<br>of their very nature. Upon the loss of one's wealth or the death of one's<br>wife or son or sire, one cries out, saying 'Alas, what grief!' and<br>dwelling upon that sorrow always enhances it. Why do you, like a foolish<br>person, indulge in grief? Why do you grieve for them that are subject to<br>grief?[74] Behold, grief is increased by indulgence as fear is by<br>yielding to. This body even is not mine. Nothing in this earth is mine.<br>Or, the things of this earth belong as much to others as to me. The wise,<br>seeing, this, do not suffer themselves to be deluded. There are thousands<br>of causes for sorrow, and hundreds of causes for joy. These every day<br>affect the ignorant only, but not him that is wise. These, in course of<br>Time. become objects of affection or aversion, and appearing as bliss or<br>woe revolve (as if in a wheel) for affecting living creatures. There is<br>only sorrow in this world but no happiness. It is for this that sorrow<br>only is felt. Indeed, sorrow springs from that affliction called desire,<br>and happiness springs from the affliction called sorrow. Sorrow comes<br>after happiness, and happiness after sorrow. One does not always suffer<br>sorrow or always enjoy happiness. Happiness always ends in sorrow, and<br>sometimes proceeds from sorrow itself. He, therefore, that desires<br>eternal happiness must abandon both. When sorrow must arise upon the<br>expiration of happiness, and happiness upon the expiration of sorrow, one<br>should, for that, cast off, like a (snake-bit) limb of one's body, that<br>from which one experiences sorrow or that heart-burning which is nurtured<br>by sorrow or that which is the root of his anxiety.[75] Be it happiness<br>or sorrow, be it agreeable or disagreeable, whatever comes should be<br>borne with an unaffected heart. O amiable one, if thou abstainest, in<br>even a slight measure, from doing what is agreeable to your wives and<br>children, thou shalt then know who is whose and why so and for what. They<br>that are highly stupid and they that are masters of their souls enjoy<br>happiness here. They however, that occupy an intermediate place suffer<br>misery. This, O Yudhishthira, is what Senajit of great wisdom said, that<br>person who was conversant with what is good or bad in this world, with<br>duties, and with happiness and misery. He who is grieved at other<br>people's griefs can never be happy. There is no end of grief, and grief<br>arises from happiness itself. Happiness and misery, prosperity and<br>adversity, gain and loss, death and life, in their turn, wait upon all<br>creatures. For this reason the wise man of tranquil soul should neither<br>be elated with joy nor be depressed with sorrow. To be engaged in battle<br>has been said to be the Sacrifice for a king; a due observance of the<br>science of chastisement is his Yoga; and the gift of wealth in sacrifices<br>in the form of Dakshina is his Renunciation. All these should be regarded<br>as acts that sanctify him. By governing the kingdom with intelligence and<br>policy, casting off pride, performing sacrifices, and looking at<br>everything and all persons with kindness and impartiality, a high-souled<br>king, after death, sports in the region of the gods. By winning battles,<br>protecting his kingdom, drinking the Soma juice, advancing his subjects,<br>wielding judiciously the rod of Chastisement, and casting off his body at<br>last in fight, a king enjoys happiness in heaven. Having studied all the<br>Vedas and the other scriptures duty, having protected the kingdom<br>properly, and having caused all the four orders to adhere to their<br>respective duties, a king becomes sanctified and finally sports in<br>heaven. He is the best of kings whose conduct, even after his death, is<br>applauded by the inhabitants of city and country and by his counsellors<br>and friends."
