                            "The Naga said, 'O thou of sweet smiles, for whom hast thou taken that<br>Brahmana? Is he really a human being or is he some deity that has come<br>hither in the disguise of a Brahmana? O thou of great fame, who is there<br>among human beings that would be desirous of seeing me or that would be<br>competent for the purpose? Can a human being, desiring to see me, leave<br>such a command with thee about dispatching me to him for paying him a<br>visit at the place where he is dwelling? Amongst the deities and Asuras<br>and celestial Rishis, O amiable lady, the Nagas are endued with great<br>energy. Possessed of great speed, they are endued again with excellent<br>fragrance. They deserve to be worshipped. They are capable of granting<br>boons. Indeed, we too deserve to be followed by others in our train. I<br>tell thee, O lady, that we are incapable of being seen by human<br>beings.'[1935]<br><br>"The spouse of the Naga chief said, 'Judging by his simplicity and<br>candour I know that that Brahmana is not any deity who subsists on air. O<br>thou of great wrath, I also know this, viz., that he reveres thee with<br>all his heart. His heart is set upon the accomplishment of some object<br>that depends upon thy aid. As the bird called Chataka, which is fond of<br>rain, waits in earnest expectation of a shower (for slaking its thirst),<br>even so is that Brahmana waiting in expectation of a meeting with<br>thee.[1936] Let no calamity betake him in consequence of his inability to<br>obtain a sight of thee. No person born like thee in a respectable family<br>can be regarded to remain respectable by neglecting a guest arrived at<br>his house.[1937] Casting off that wrath which is natural to thee, it<br>behoveth thee to go and see that Brahmana. It behoveth thee not to suffer<br>thyself to be consumed by disappointing that Brahmana. The king or the<br>prince, by refusing to wipe the tears of persons that come to him from<br>hopes of relief, incurs the sin of foeticide. By abstaining from speech<br>one attains to wisdom. By practising gifts one acquires great fame. By<br>adhering to truthfulness of speech, one acquires the gift of eloquence<br>and comes to be honoured in heaven. By giving away land one attains to<br>that high end which is ordained for Rishis leading the sacred mode of<br>life. By earning wealth through righteous means, one succeeds in<br>attaining to many desirable fruits. By doing in its entirety what is<br>beneficial for oneself, one can avoid going to hell. That is what the<br>righteous say.<br><br>"The Naga said, 'I had no arrogance due to pride. In consequence,<br>however, of my birth, the measure of my arrogance was considerable. Of<br>wrath, which is born of desire, O blessed lady, I have none. It has all<br>been consumed by the fire of thy excellent instructions. I do not behold,<br>O blessed dame, any darkness that is thicker than wrath. In consequence,<br>however, of the Naga having excess of wrath, they have become object of<br>reproach with all persons.[1938] By succumbing to the influence of wrath,<br>the ten-headed Ravana of great prowess, became the rival of Sakra and was<br>for that reason slain by Rama in battle. Hearing that the Rishi Rama of<br>Bhrigu's race had entered the inner apartments of their palace for<br>bringing away the calf of the Homa cow of their sire, the sons of<br>Karttaviryya, yielding to wrath, took such entry as an insult to their<br>royal house, and as the consequence thereof, they met with destruction at<br>the hands of Rama. Indeed, Karttaviryya of great strength, resembling the<br>Thousand-eyed Indra himself, in consequence of his having yielded to<br>wrath, was slain in battle by Rama of Jamadagni's race. Verily, O amiable<br>lady at thy words I have restrained my wrath, that foe of penances that<br>destroyer of all that is beneficial for myself. I praise my own self<br>greatly since, O large-eyed one, I am fortunate enough to own thee for my<br>wife,&#8212;thee that are possessed of every virtue and that hast<br>inexhaustible merits. I shall now proceed to that spot where the Brahmana<br>is staying. I shall certainly address that Brahmana in proper words and<br>he shall certainly go hence, his wishes being accomplished."
