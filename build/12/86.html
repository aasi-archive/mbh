                            "Yudhishthira said, 'What should be the kind of city within which the<br>king should himself dwell? Should he select one already made or should he<br>cause one to be especially constructed? Tell me this O grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'It is proper, O Bharata, to enquire about the conduct<br>that should be followed and the defences that should be adopted with<br>respect to the city in which, O son of Kunti, a king should reside. I<br>shall, therefore, discourse to thee on the subject, referring especially<br>to the defences of citadels. Having listened to me, thou shouldst make<br>the arrangements required and conduct thyself attentively as directed.<br>Keeping his eye on the six different kinds of citadels, the king should<br>build his cities containing every kind of affluence and every other<br>article of use in abundance. Those six varieties are water-citadels,<br>earth-citadels, hill-citadels, human-citadels, mud-citadels, and<br>forest-citadels.[247] The king, with his ministers and the army<br>thoroughly loyal to him, should reside in that city which is defended by<br>a citadel which contains an abundant stock of rice and weapons,&#8212;which is<br>protected with impenetrable walls and a trench, which teems with<br>elephants and steeds and cars, which is inhabited by men possessed of<br>learning and versed in the mechanical arts, where provisions of every<br>kind have been well stored, whose population is virtuous in conduct and<br>clever in business and consists of strong and energetic men and animals,<br>which is adorned with many open squares and rows of shops, where the<br>behaviour of all persons is righteous, where peace prevails, where no<br>danger exists, which blazes with beauty and resounds with music and<br>songs, where the houses are all spacious, were the residents number among<br>them many brave and wealthy individuals, which echoes with the chant of<br>Vedic hymns, where festivities and rejoicings frequently take place, and<br>where the deities are always worshipped.[248] Residing there, the king<br>should be employed in filling his treasury, increasing his forces,<br>enhancing the number of his friends, and establishing courts of justice.<br>He should cheek all abuses and evils in both his cities and his<br>provinces. He should be employed in collecting provisions of every kind<br>and in filling his arsenals with care. He should also increase his stores<br>of rice and other grain, and strengthen his counsels (with wisdom). He<br>should further, enhance his stores of fuel, iron, chaff, charcoal,<br>timber, horns, bones, bamboos, marrow, oils and ghee, fat, honey,<br>medicines, flax, resinous exudations, rice, weapons, shafts, leather<br>catgut (for bow-strings), caries, and strings and cords made of munja<br>grass and other plants and creepers. He should also increase the number<br>of tanks and well, containing large quantities of water, and should<br>protect all juicy trees.[249] He should entertain with honour and<br>attention preceptors (of different sciences), Ritwijas, and priests,<br>mighty bowmen, persons skilled in architecture, astronomers and<br>astrologers, and physicians, as also all men possessed of wisdom and<br>intelligence and self-restraint and cleverness and courage and learning<br>and high birth and energy of mind, and capable of close application to<br>all kinds of work. The king should honour the righteous and chastise the<br>unrighteous. He should, acting with resolution, set the several orders to<br>their respective duties. Ascertaining properly, by means of spies, the<br>outward behaviour and the state of mind of the inhabitants of his city<br>and provinces, he should adopt those measures that may be required. The<br>king should himself supervise his spies and counsels, his treasury, and<br>the agencies for inflicting chastisements. Upon these everything may be<br>said to depend. With spies constituting his sight, the king should<br>ascertain all the acts and intentions of his foes, friends, and neutrals.<br>He should then, with heedfulness, devise his own measures, honouring<br>those that are loyal to him and punishing those that are hostile. The<br>king should always adore the gods in sacrifices and make gifts without<br>giving pain to anybody. He should protect his subjects, never doing<br>anything that may obstruct or thwart righteousness. He should always<br>maintain and protect the helpless, the masterless, and the old, and women<br>that are widows. The king should always honour the ascetics and make unto<br>them gifts, at proper seasons of cloths and vessels and food. The king<br>should, with attentive care, inform the ascetics (within his dominions)<br>of the state of his own self, of all his measures, and of the kingdom,<br>and should always behave with humility in their presence. When he sees<br>ascetics of high birth and great learning that have abandoned all earthly<br>objects, he should honour them with gifts of beds and seats and food.<br>Whatever the nature of the distress into which he may fall, he should<br>confide in an ascetic. The very robbers repose confidence upon persons of<br>that character. The king should place his wealth in charge of an ascetic<br>and should take wisdom from him. He should not, however, always wait upon<br>them or worship them on all occasions.[250] From among those residing in<br>his own kingdom, he should select one for friendship. Similarly, he<br>should select another from among those that reside in the kingdom of his<br>foe. He should select a third from among those residing in the forests,<br>and a fourth from among those dwelling in the kingdoms paying tribute to<br>him. He should show hospitality towards and bestow honours upon them and<br>assign them the means of sustenance. He should behave towards the<br>ascetics dwelling in the kingdoms of foes and in the forests in the same<br>way as towards those that reside in his own kingdom. Engaged in penances<br>and of rigid vows they would, if calamity overtakes the king and if he<br>solicits protection, grant him what he wants. I have now told thee in<br>brief the indications of the city in which the king should reside.'"
