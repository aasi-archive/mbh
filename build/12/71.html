                            Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grand sire, in what way should the king<br>protect his subjects so as to be able to avoid grief and so as not to<br>offend against righteousness?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall recite, O king, those eternal duties in brief,<br>for if I were to mention them in detail, I would never attain to their<br>end. Thou shouldst worship those Brahmanas that are devoted to their<br>duties, possessed of learning, regular in worshipping the gods, observant<br>of high vows, and endued with other accomplishments, when they come to<br>thy abode, and employ them in officiating in thy sacrifices. With thy<br>priest accompanying thee, thou shouldst rise up when they approach, and<br>touch and worship their feet, and do every other act that is necessary.<br>Doing these acts of piety and discharging other acts that are for thy own<br>good, thou shouldst (by presents) cause those Brahmanas to utter<br>benedictions on thee for the success of thy purposes. Endued with<br>sincerity, and wisdom and intelligence, O Bharata, thou shouldst adopt<br>truth and avoid lust and wrath. That foolish king who pursues Profit<br>without driving away lust and wrath, fails to acquire virtue and<br>ultimately sacrifices Profit as well. Never employ those that are<br>covetous and foolish in matters connected with Pleasure and Profit. Thou<br>shouldst always employ in all thy acts those that are free from<br>covetousness and possessed of intelligence. Stained with lust and wrath<br>and unskilled in the transaction of business foolish persons, if vested<br>with authority in matters of Profit, always oppress the people by diverse<br>contrivances productive of mischief. With a sixth part upon fair<br>calculation, of the yield of the soil as his tribute, with fines and<br>forfeitures levied upon offenders, with the imposts, according to the<br>scriptures, upon merchants and traders in return for the protection<br>granted to them, a king should fill his treasury.[226] Realising this<br>just tribute and governing the kingdom properly the king should, with<br>heedfulness, act in such a way that his subjects may not feel the<br>pressure of want. Men become deeply devoted to that king who discharges<br>the duty of protection properly, who is endued with liberality, who is<br>steady in the observance of righteousness, who is vigilant, and who is<br>free from Just and hate. Never desire to fill thy treasury by acting<br>unrighteously or from covetousness. That king who does not act in<br>accordance with the scriptures fails to earn wealth and religious merit.<br>That king who is mindful only of the means of acquiring wealth, never<br>succeeds in acquiring both religious merit and wealth. The wealth again<br>that he acquires (by such means) is seen to be lavished on unworthy<br>objects.[227] That avaricious king who through folly oppresses his<br>subjects by levying taxes not sanctioned by the scriptures, is said to<br>wrong his own self. As a person desirous of milk never obtains any by<br>cutting off the udders of a cow, similarly a kingdom afflicted by<br>improper means, never yields any profit to the king.[228] He who treats a<br>milch cow with tenderness always obtains milk from it. Similarly, the<br>king who rules his kingdom by the aid of proper means, reaps much fruit<br>from it. By protecting a kingdom properly and ruling it by the aid of<br>judicious means, a king, O Yudhishthira, may succeed in always obtaining<br>much wealth. The earth, well protected by the king, yields crops and gold<br>(to the ruler and the ruled) even like a gratified mother yielding milk<br>to her child. Imitate the example, O king, of the flowerman and not of<br>the charcoal-maker. Becoming such and discharging, the duty of<br>protection, thou mayst be able to enjoy the earth for ever.[229] If in<br>attacking an enemy's kingdom thy treasury becomes exhausted, thou mayst<br>refill it by taking wealth from all except Brahmanas. Let not thy heart<br>be moved, even when thou art in great distress, upon seeing Brahmanas<br>possessed of wealth. I need not speak then of what thou shouldst do when<br>thou art in affluence. Thou shouldst give them wealth to the best of thy<br>power and as they deserve and protect them, comforting them on all<br>occasions. By conducting thyself in this way, thou mayst acquire such<br>regions hereafter as are most difficult of acquisition. Adopting such<br>virtuous behaviour, do thou protect thy subjects. Thou mayst then obtain,<br>O delighter of the Kurus, fame that is everlasting, high, and pure.<br>Protect thy subjects righteously, O son of Pandu, for no regret or pain<br>will then be thine. Protection of the subject is the highest duty of the<br>king, since compassion to all creatures and protecting them from injury<br>has been said to be the highest merit. Persons conversant with duties<br>regard that to be the highest merit of the king, when, engaged in<br>protecting all creatures, the king displays compassion towards them. The<br>sin a king incurs by neglecting for a single day to protect his subjects<br>from fear is such that he does not attain to end of his sufferings (for<br>it) in hell till after a thousand years. The merit a king earns by<br>protecting his subjects righteously for a single day is such that he<br>enjoys its reward in heaven for ten thousand years. All those regions<br>that are acquired by persons leading duly the Garhasthya, the<br>Brahmacharya, and the Vanaprastha modes of life, are soon acquired by a<br>king by only protecting his subjects righteously. Do thou, O son of<br>Kunti, observe with great care this duty (of protection). Thou shalt then<br>obtain the reward of righteousness and no grief and pain will be thine.<br>Thou shalt, O son of Pandu, obtain great prosperity in heaven. Merit like<br>this is impossible to be acquired by persons that are not kings. A<br>person, therefore, who is a king, and no other, can succeed in earning<br>such reward of virtue. Possessed of intelligence, thou hast obtained a<br>kingdom. Do thou protect thy subjects righteously. Gratify Indra with<br>offerings of Soma and the friends and well-wishers with the objects of<br>their wishes.'"
