                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast spoken to me about the four modes of human<br>life. I desire to know more of-them. Do thou discourse on them in detail.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O Yudhishthira of mighty arms, all the duties that are<br>practised in this world by the righteous are known to thee as they are<br>known to me. O foremost of virtuous persons, listen now to me about what<br>thou askest, viz. the merit (that a king acquires) in consequence of the<br>duties practised by others leading other modes of life.[206] All the<br>merits, O son of Kunti, that belong to persons practising the duties of<br>the four modes of life, attach, O foremost of men, to righteous kings. A<br>king who is not governed by lust and hate, who rules with the aid of the<br>science of chastisement, and who looks equally on all creatures, O<br>Yudhishthira, attains to the object of the Bhaikshya mode of life.[207]<br>That king who is possessed of knowledge, who makes gifts to deserving<br>persons on proper occasions, who knows how to favour and punish, who<br>conducts himself in all things according to the injunctions of the<br>scriptures, and who has tranquillity of soul, attains to the object of<br>the Garhasthya mode of life. That king who always worships those that are<br>deserving of worship by giving them their due, completely attains, O son<br>of Kunti, to the object of the Bhaikshya mode of life. That king, O<br>Yudhishthira, who rescues from distress, to the best of his power, his<br>kinsmen and relatives and friends, attains to the object of the<br>Vanaprashtha mode of life. That king who on every occasion honours those<br>that are foremost among men and those that are foremost among Yatis,<br>attains, O son of Kunti, to the object of the Vanaprashtha mode of life.<br>That king, O Partha, who daily makes offerings unto the Pitris and large<br>offerings unto all living creatures including men, attains to the object<br>of the same mode of life. That king, O tiger among men, who grinds the<br>kingdoms of others for protecting the righteous, attains to the object of<br>the same mode of life. In consequence of the protection of all creatures<br>as also of the proper protection of his own kingdom, a king earns the<br>merit of as many sacrifices as the number of creatures protected, and<br>accordingly attains to the object of the Sannyasa mode of life. Study of<br>the Vedas every day, forgiveness, and worship of preceptors, and services<br>rendered to one's own teacher, lead to the attainment of the object of<br>Brahmacharya. That king who silently recites his mantras every day and<br>who always worships the gods according to the ordinance, attains, O tiger<br>among men, to the object of the Garhasthya mode of life. That king who<br>engages in battle with the resolve of protecting his kingdom or meeting<br>with death, attains to the object of the Vanaprastha mode of life. That<br>king who gives unto persons leading a Vanaprastha mode of life and unto<br>Brahmanas versed in the three Vedas attains to the object of the<br>Vanaprastha mode of life. That king who displays compassion towards all<br>creatures and abstains entirely from cruelty, attains to the objects of<br>all the modes of life. That king, O Yudhishthira, who shows compassion to<br>the young and the old, O son of Kunti, under every circumstance, attains<br>to the objects of every mode of life. That king, O perpetuator of Kuru's<br>race, who affords relief to all oppressed people that seek his<br>protection, attains to the object of the Garhasthya mode of life. That<br>king who protects all creatures mobile and immobile, and honours them is<br>they deserve, attains to the object of the Garhasthya mode of life.<br>Bestowing favours and inflicting punishments upon the wives and brothers,<br>elder and younger, and upon their sons and grandsons, are the domestic<br>duties of a king and these constitute his best penances. By honouring<br>those that are righteous and deserving of worship and protecting those<br>that have (by their penances) acquired it knowledge of self, a king, O<br>tiger among men, attains to the object of the Garhasthya mode of life.<br>Inviting to this home, O Bharata, persons that have betaken themselves to<br>that Vanaprastha and other modes of life, and treating them with food,<br>constitute the domestic duties of a king. That king who duly adheres to<br>the duties laid down by the Creator, obtains the blessed merits of all<br>the modes of life. That king, O son of Kunti, in whom no virtue is<br>wanting, that foremost of men, O Yudhishthira, is said by the learned to<br>be a person in the observance of the Vanaprastha and all the other modes<br>of life. That king who duly honours the office or rank which deserves<br>honour, the race or family which deserves honour, and those old men that<br>deserve honour is said, O Yudhishthira, to live in all the modes of<br>life.[208] A king, O son of Kunti, by observing the duties of his country<br>and those of his family, acquires, O tiger among men, the merits of all<br>the modes of life. That king who at proper seasons bestows upon righteous<br>persons affluence or gifts of value, earns the merits, O king, of all the<br>modes of life. That king, O son of Kunti, who while overcome with danger<br>and fear still keeps his eye on the duties of all men,[209] earns the<br>merits of all the modes of life. The king obtains a share of the merits<br>earned under his protection by righteous people in his dominions. On the<br>other hand, if kings, O tiger among men, do not protect the righteous<br>people within their dominions, they then take the sins of the latter (of<br>omission and commission). Those men also, O Yudhishthira. who assist<br>kings (in protecting their subjects), become equally entitled, O sinless<br>one, to a share of the merits earned by others (in consequence of that<br>protection). The learned say that the Garhasthya, which we have adopted,<br>is superior to all the other modes of life. The conclusions in respect of<br>it are very clear. It is certainly sacred, O tiger among men. That man<br>who regards all creatures to be like his own self, who never does any<br>harm and has his wrath under control, obtains great happiness both here<br>and hereafter.[210] A king can easily cross the ocean of the world, with<br>kingly duties as his boat passed of great speed, urged on by the breeze<br>of gifts, having the scriptures for its tackle and intelligence for the<br>strength of its helmsman, and kept afloat by the power of righteousness.<br>When the principle of desire in his heart is withdrawn from every earthly<br>object, he is then regarded as one resting on his understanding alone. In<br>this state he soon attains to Brahma.[211] Becoming cheerful by<br>meditation and by restraining desire and other passions of the heart, O<br>tiger among men, it king, engaged in discharging the dully of protection,<br>succeeds in obtaining great merit. Do thou, therefore, O Yudhishthira,<br>exert thyself carefully in protecting Brahmanas of pious deeds and<br>devoted to the study of the Vedas, as also all other men. By exercising<br>the duty of protection only, O Bharata, the king earns merit that is a<br>hundred times greater than what is earned by recluses in their asylums<br>within the wood.'<br><br>"I have now described, O eldest son of Pandu, the diverse duties of men.<br>Do thou adhere to kingly duties that are eternal and that have been<br>practised by great men since days of old. If thou employest thyself with<br>concentrated attention to the duty of protecting (thy subjects), O tiger<br>among men, thou mayst then, O son of Pandu, obtain the merits of all the<br>four modes of life and of all the four orders of men!"
