                            "Yajnavalkya said, Listen to me, O foremost of men, as I tell thee what<br>the duration of time is in respect to the Unmanifest (or the Supreme<br>Purusha). Ten thousand Kalpas are said to constitute a single day of his.<br>The duration of his night is equal. When his night expires, he awakes, O<br>monarch, and first creates herbs and plants which constitute the<br>sustenance of all embodied creatures. He then creates Brahman who springs<br>from a golden egg. That Brahman is the form of all created things, as has<br>been heard by us. Having dwelt for one whole year within that egg, the<br>great ascetic Brahman, called also Prajapati (Lord of all creatures),<br>came out of it and created the whole Earth, and the Heaven above. The<br>Lord then, it is read in the Vedas, O king, placed the sky between Heaven<br>and Earth separated from each other. Seven thousand and five hundred<br>Kalpas measure the day of Brahman. Persons conversant with the science of<br>Adhyatma say that his night also is of an equal duration. Brahmana,<br>called Mahan, then creates Consciousness called Bhuta and endued with<br>excellent essence.[1645] Before creating any physical bodies out of the<br>ingredients called the Great elements, Mahan or Brahma, endued with<br>penances, created four others called his sons. They are the sires of the<br>original sires, O Best of kings, as heard by us.[1646] It hath been also<br>heard by us, O monarch that the senses (of knowledge) along with the four<br>inner faculties, have sprung from the (five Great elements called)<br>Pitris, and that the entire universe of mobile and immobile Beings has<br>been filled with those Great elements.[1647] The puissant Consciousness<br>created the five Bhutas. These are Earth, Wind, Space, Water, and Light<br>numbering the fifth. This Consciousness (who is a Great Being and) from<br>whom springs the third creating, has five thousand Kalpas for his night,<br>and his day is of equal duration. Sound, Touch, Form, Taste, and<br>Scent,&#8212;these five are called Visesha. They inhere into the five great<br>Bhutas. All creatures, O king, incessantly pervaded by these five, desire<br>one another's companionship, become subservient to one another; and<br>challenging one another, transcend one another; and led by those<br>immutable and seductive principles, creatures kill one another and wander<br>in this world entering into numerous orders of Being.[1648] Three<br>thousands of Kalpas represent the duration of their day. The measure of<br>their night also is the same.[1649] The Mind roveth over all things, O<br>king, led on by the Senses. The Senses do not perceive anything. It is<br>the Mind that perceives through them. The Eye sees forms when aided by<br>the Mind but never by itself. When the Mind is distracted, the Eye fails<br>to perceive with even the objects fully before it. It is commonly said<br>that the Senses perceive. This is not true, for it is the Mind that<br>perceives through the Senses. When the cessation takes place of the<br>activity of the Mind, the cessation of the activity of the Senses<br>follows. That is the cessation of the activity of the Senses which is the<br>cessation of the activity of the Mind. One should thus regard the Senses<br>to be under the domination of the Mind. Indeed, the Mind is said to be<br>the Lord of all the Senses. O thou of great fame, these are all the<br>twenty Bhutas in the Universe.'"
