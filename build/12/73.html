                            "Bhishma said, 'The king, with an eye to both religious merit and profit<br>whose considerations are often very intricate, should, without delay,<br>appoint a priest possessed of learning and intimate acquaintance with the<br>Vedas and the (other) scriptures. Those kings that have priests possessed<br>of virtuous souls and conversant with policy, and that are themselves<br>possessed of such attributes, enjoy prosperity in every direction. Both<br>the priest and the king should have such qualities as are worthy of<br>regard and should be observant of vows and penances. They would then<br>succeed in supporting and aggrandising the subjects and the deities, the<br>Pitris and the children.[231] It is laid down that they should be<br>possessed of similar hearts and should be each other's friends. In<br>consequence of such friendship between Brahmana and Kshatriya, the<br>subjects become happy. If they do not regard each other, destruction<br>would overtake the people. The Brahmana and the Kshatriya are said to be<br>the progenitors of all men. In this connection is cited the old story<br>about the discourse between Aila's son and Kasyapa. Listen to it, O<br>Yudhishthira.'<br><br>"Aila said, 'When the Brahmana forsakes the Kshatriya or the Kshatriya<br>forsakes the Brahmana, who amongst them should be regarded superior and<br>upon whom do the other orders rely and maintain themselves?'<br><br>"Kasyapa said, 'Ruin overtakes the kingdom of the Kshatriya when the<br>Brahmana and Kshatriya contend with each other. Robbers infest that<br>kingdom in which confusion prevails, and all good men regard the ruler to<br>be a Mlechcha. Their oxen do not thrive, nor their children. Their pots<br>(of milk) are not churned, and no sacrifices are performed there. The<br>children do not study the Vedas in kingdoms where Brahmanas abandon<br>Kshatriyas. In their houses wealth does not increase. Their children do<br>not become good and do not study the scriptures and perform sacrifices.<br>Those Kshatriyas that abandon Brahmanas become impure in blood and assume<br>the nature of robbers. The Brahmana and the Kshatriya are connected with<br>each other naturally, and each protects the other. The Kshatriya is the<br>cause of the Brahmana's growth and the Brahmana is the cause of the<br>Kshatriya's growth. When each helps the other, both attain to great<br>prosperity. If their friendship, existing from days of old, breaks, a<br>confusion sets over everything. No person desirous of crossing the ocean<br>of life succeeds in his task even as a small boat floating on the bosom<br>of the sea. The four orders of men become confounded and destruction<br>overtakes all. If the Brahmana. who is like a tree is protected, gold and<br>honey are showered. If, on the other hand, he is not protected, it then<br>tears and sins are showered, When Brahmanas fall away from the Vedas and<br>(in the absence of a Kshatriya ruler) seek protection from the<br>scriptures, then Indra does not pour rain seasonably and diverse kinds of<br>calamities ceaselessly afflict the kingdom. When a sinful wretch having<br>slain a woman or a Brahmana does not incur obloquy in assemblies of<br>fellowmen and has not to stand in fear of the king, then danger threatens<br>the Kshatriya ruler. In consequence of the sins perpetrated by sinful<br>men, the god Rudra appears in the kingdom. Indeed, the sinful by their<br>sins bring upon them that god of vengeance. He then destroys all, the<br>honest and the wicked alike (without making any distinction).'<br><br>"Aila said, 'Whence does Rudra spring? What also is his form? Creatures<br>are seen to be destroyed by creatures. Tell me all this, O Kasyapa!<br>Whence does the god Rudra spring?'<br><br>"Kasyapa said, 'Rudra exists in the hearts of men. He destroys the bodies<br>themselves in which he dwells as also the bodies of others. Rudra has<br>been said to be like atmospheric visitations and his form is like that of<br>the wind-gods.'<br><br>"Aila said, 'The Wind does not, by blowing, visibly destroy men on all<br>occasions, nor does the deity of the clouds do so by pouring rain. On the<br>other hand, it is seen among men that they lose their senses and are<br>slain through lust and malice.'<br><br>"Kasyapa said, 'Fire, blazing forth in one house, burneth a whole quarter<br>or an entire village. Similarly, this deity stupefies the senses of some<br>one and then that stupefaction touches all, the honest and the wicked<br>alike, without any distinction.'<br><br>"Aila said, 'If chastisement touches all viz., the honest and the wicked<br>alike, in consequence of the sins perpetrated by the sinful, why should<br>men, in that case, do acts that are good? Indeed, why should they not<br>perform wicked acts?'<br><br>"Kasyapa said, 'By avoiding all connection with the sinful, one becomes<br>pure and stainless. In consequence, however, of their being mixed with<br>the sinful, the sinless are overtaken by chastisement. Wood that is wet,<br>if mixed with wood that is dry, is consumed by fire in consequence of<br>such co-existence. The sinless, therefore, should never mingle with the<br>sinful.'<br><br>"Aila said, 'The earth holds the honest and the wicked. The sun warms the<br>honest and the wicked. The wind blows equally for them. Water cleanses<br>them equally.'<br><br>"Kasyapa said, 'Such, indeed, is the course of this world, O prince! It<br>is not so, however, hereafter. In the other world, there is great<br>difference of condition between the person that acts righteously and him<br>that acts sinfully. The regions that meritorious men acquire are full of<br>honey and possessed of the splendour of gold or of a fire upon which<br>clarified butter has been poured. Those regions also are likened to the<br>navel of ambrosia. The meritorious person enjoys great felicity there.<br>Death, decrepitude, and sorrow, are not there. The region for the sinful<br>is hell. Darkness and ceaseless pain are there, and it is full of sorrow.<br>Sinking in infamy, the man of sinful deeds wrung with remorse there for<br>many years. In consequence of a disunion between Brahmanas and<br>Kshatriyas, unbearable griefs afflict the people. Knowing this, a king<br>should appoint a (Brahmana) priest possessed of experience and wide<br>knowledge. A king should first install the priest in his office, and then<br>cause his own coronation. This has been laid down in the ordinance. The<br>ordinances declare that the Brahmana is the foremost of all creatures.<br>Men acquainted with the Vedas say that the Brahmana was created first. In<br>consequence of the precedence of his birth, all things that are good in<br>this world are vested in him. The rightful owner of all the best things<br>that have flowed from the Creator, the Brahmana is also, for such<br>precedence, worthy of the respect and the worship of all creatures. A<br>king, however powerful, should, according to the dictates of the<br>scriptures, bestow upon the Brahmana whatever is best and distinguished<br>above others. The Brahmana contributes to the aggrandisement of the<br>Kshatriya, and the Kshatriya to the aggrandisement of the Brahmana.<br>Brahmanas should, therefore, be especially and always worshipped by<br>kings.'"
