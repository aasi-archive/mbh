                            "Yajnavalkya said, I have, one after another, told thee the order of the<br>creation, with their total number, of the various principles, as also the<br>extent of the duration of each. Listen now to me as I tell thee of their<br>destruction. Listen to me how Brahman, who is eternal and undecaying, and<br>who is without beginning and without end, repeatedly creates and destroys<br>all created objects. When his day expires and night comes, he becomes<br>desirous of sleep. At such a time the unmanifest and holy one urges the<br>Being called Maharudra, who is conscious of his great powers, (for<br>destroying the world). Urged by the unmanifest, that Being assuming the<br>form of Surya of hundreds of thousands of rays, divides himself into a<br>dozen portions each resembling a blazing fire. He then consumes with his<br>energy, O monarch, without any loss of time, the four kinds of created<br>beings, viz., viviparous, oviparous, filth-born, and vegetable. Within<br>the twinkling of the eye all mobile and immobile creatures being thus<br>destroyed, the Earth becomes on every side as bare as a tortoise shell.<br>Having burnt everything on the face of the Earth, Rudra, of immeasurable<br>might, then quickly fills the bare Earth with Water possessed of great<br>force. He then creates the Yuga-fire which dries up that Water (into<br>which the bare Earth has been dissolved). The Water disappearing, the<br>great element of Fire continues to blaze fiercely. Then comes the mighty<br>Wind of immeasurable force, in his eight forms, who swallows up quickly<br>that blazing fire of transcendent force, possessed of seven flames, and<br>identifiable with the heat existing every creature. Having swallowed up<br>that fire, the Wind courses in every direction, upwards, downwards, and<br>transversely. Then space of immeasurable existent swallowed up that Wind<br>of transcendent energy. Then Mind cheerfully swallows up that<br>immeasurable Space. Then that Lord of all creatures, viz., Consciousness,<br>who is the Soul of every-thing, swallows up the Mind. Consciousness, in<br>his turn, is swallowed up by the Mahat-soul who is conversant with the<br>Past, the Present, and the Future. The incomparable Mahat-soul or<br>Universe is then swallowed up by Sambhu, that Lord of all things, to whom<br>the Yoga attributes of Anima, Laghima, Prapti, etc., naturally inhere,<br>who is regarded as the Supreme and pure Effulgence that is Immutable. His<br>hands and feet extend over every part; his eyes and head and face are<br>everywhere, his ears reach every place, and he exists overwhelming all<br>things. He is the heart of all creatures; His measure is of a digit of<br>the thumb. That Infinite and supreme Soul, that Lord of all, thus<br>swallows up the Universe. After this, what remains is the Undecaying and<br>the Immutable. One who is without defect of any kind, who is the Creator<br>of the Past, the Present, and the Future; and who is perfectly faultless,<br>I have thus, O monarch, duly told thee of Destruction. I shall now<br>discourse to thee on the subjects of Adhyatma, Adhibhuta, and<br>Adhidaivata.&#8212;'"
