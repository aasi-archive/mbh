                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, thou hast now finished thy discourse<br>upon the duties of kings. From what thou hast said it seems that<br>Chastisement occupies a high position and is the lord of everything for<br>everything depends upon Chastisement. It seems, O puissant one, that<br>Chastisement, which is possessed of great energy and which is present<br>everywhere, is the foremost of all beings among either gods and Rishis<br>and high-souled Pitris and Yakshas and Rakshasas and Pisachas and<br>Sadhyas, or living beings in this world including beasts and birds. Thou<br>hast said that the entire universe, mobile and immobile, including gods,<br>Asuras, and men, may be seen to depend upon Chastisement. I now desire, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, to know truly who Chastisement is. Of what kind<br>is he? What is his form? What is his disposition? Of what is he made?<br>Whence is his origin? What are his features? What is his splendour? How<br>does he remain wakeful among living creatures so heedfully? Who is he<br>that remains eternally wakeful, protecting this universe? Who is he that<br>is known to be the foremost of all things? Who, indeed, is that high<br>personage called Chastisement? What is that upon which Chastisement<br>depends? And what is his course?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O descendent of Kuru, who Chastisement is and why<br>he is called also Vyavahara! That upon whom all things depend is called<br>Chastisement. Chastisement is that by which righteousness is kept up. He<br>is sometimes called Vyavahara. In order that the righteousness of a king<br>that is heedfully awake may not suffer extinction (Chastisement has come<br>to be called by that name). It is for this reason that the name Vyavahara<br>becomes applicable to it.[362] In olden days Manu, O king, declared first<br>of all this truth, viz.,&#8212;'He who protects all creatures, the loved and<br>the odious equally, by impartially wielding the lord of Chastisement, is<br>said to be the embodiment of righteousness.'&#8212;These words that I have<br>said were, O king first, uttered in days of old by Manu. They represent<br>the high words of Brahman. And because these words were spoken first,<br>therefore, they are known as the first words. And since it is by<br>Chastisement that the misappropriation of other people's possessions is<br>stopped, therefore Chastisement has come to be called by the name of<br>Vyavahara. The aggregate of three always rests on well applied<br>Chastisement. Chastisement is a great god. In form he looks like a<br>blazing fire. His complexion is dark like that of the petals of the blue<br>lotus. He is equipt with four teeth, has four arms and eight legs and<br>many eyes. His cars are pointed like shafts and his hair stands upright.<br>He has matted locks and two tongues. His face has the hue of copper, and<br>he is clad in a lion's skin.[363] That irresistible deity assumes such a<br>fierce shape. Assuming again the form of the sword, the bow, the mace,<br>the dart, the trident, the mallet, the arrow, the thick and short club,<br>the battle-axe, the discus, the noose, the heavy bludgeon, the rapier,<br>the lance, and in fact of every kind of weapon that exists on earth.<br>Chastisement moves in the world. Indeed, Chastisement moves on earth,<br>piercing and cutting and afflicting and lopping off and dividing and<br>striking and slaying and rushing against its victims. These, O<br>Yudhishthira, are some of the names which Chastisement bears, viz.,<br>Sword, Sabre, Righteousness, Fury, the Irresistible, the Parent of<br>prosperity, Victory, Punisher, Checker, the Eternal, the Scriptures,<br>Brahmana, Mantra, Avenger, the Foremost of first Legislators, Judge, the<br>Undecaying, God, the individual whose course is irresistible, the<br>Ever-agoing, the First. born, the individual without affections, the Soul<br>of Rudra, the eldest Manu and the great Benefactor Chastisement is the<br>holy Vishnu. He is the puissant Narayana. And because he always assumes a<br>terrible form, therefore he is called Mahapurusha. His wife Morality is<br>also known by the names of Brahmana's Daughter, Lakshmi, Vriti,<br>Saraswati, and Mother of the universe. Chastisement thus has many forms.<br>Blessings and curse, pleasure and pain, righteousness and<br>unrighteousness, strength and weakness, fortune and misfortune, merit and<br>demerit, virtue and vice, desire and aversion, season and month, night<br>and day, and hour, heedfulness and heedlessness, joy and anger, peace and<br>self-restraint, destiny and exertion, salvation and condemnation, fear<br>and fearlessness, injury and abstention from injury, penances and<br>sacrifice and rigid abstinence, poison and healthy food, the beginning,<br>the middle, and the end, the result of all murderous acts, insolence,<br>insanity, arrogance, pride, patience, policy, impolicy, powerlessness and<br>power, respect, disrespect, decay and stability, humility, charity,<br>fitness of time and unfitness of time, falsehood, wisdom, truth, belief,<br>disbelief, impotence, trade, profit, loss, success, defeat, fierceness,<br>mildness, death, acquisition and non-acquisition, agreement and<br>disagreement, that which should be done and that which should not be<br>done, strength and weakness, malice and goodwill, righteousness and<br>unrighteousness, shame and shamelessness, modesty, prosperity and<br>adversity, energy, acts, learning, eloquence, keenness of<br>Understanding,&#8212;all these, O Yudhishthira, are forms of Chastisement in<br>this world. Hence, Chastisement is exceedingly multiform. If Chastisement<br>had not existed, all creatures would have ground one another. Through<br>fear of Chastisement. O Yudhisthira, living creatures do not slay one<br>another. The subjects, O king, always protected by Chastisement, enhance<br>the might of their ruler. It is for this that Chastisement is regarded as<br>the foremost refuge of all. Chastisement, O king, quickly sets the world<br>on the path of righteousness. Dependent upon truth, righteousness exists<br>in the Brahmanas. Endued with righteousness, foremost of Brahmanas became<br>attached to the Vedas. From the Vedas the sacrifices flow. Sacrifices<br>gratify the deities. The deities, being gratified, commend the denizens<br>of the earth to Indra. For benefiting the denizens of the earth, Indra<br>gives them food (in the form of rain without which crops and vegetation<br>would fail). The life of all creatures depends upon food. From food<br>creatures derive their support and growth. Chastisement (in the form of<br>the Kshatriya ruler) remains wakeful amongst them. For serving this<br>object, Chastisement assumes the form of a Kshatriya among men.<br>Protecting men, he remains awake, always heedful and never decaying.<br>Chastisement has again these other eight names, viz., God, Man, Life,<br>Power, Heart, the Lord of all creatures, the Soul of all things, and the<br>Living creature. God gave both affluence and the rod of chastisement to<br>the king who is possessed of strength (in the form of military forces)<br>and who is a combination of five ingredients.[364] Nobility of blood,<br>ministers of great wealth, knowledge, the different kinds of forces (such<br>as strength of body, energy of mind, etc.), with the eight objects<br>mentioned below, and the other force (viz., that which depends upon a<br>well-filled treasury), should be sought for the king, O Yudhishthira.<br>Those eight objects are elephants, horses, cars, foot soldiers, boats,<br>impressed labourers (for following the camp and doing other work),<br>increase of population, and cattle (such as sheep, etc.). Of the army<br>equipped in mail and with other accoutrements, car-warriors,<br>elephant-warriors, cavalry, Infantry, officers, and surgeons constitute<br>the limbs. Beggars, principal judges, astrologers, performers of<br>propitiatory and Atharvan rites, treasury, allies, grain, and all other<br>requisites, constitute the body, composed of seven attributes and eight<br>limbs, of a kingdom. Chastisement is another powerful limb of a kingdom.<br>Chastisement (in the form of an army) is the author of a kingdom. God<br>himself has, with great care, sent Chastisement for the use of the<br>Kshatriya. This eternal universe is impartial Chastisement's self. There<br>is nothing more worthy of respect by kings than Chastisement by which the<br>ways of Righteousness are pointed out. Brahman himself, for the<br>protection of the world and for establishing the duties of different<br>individuals, sent down (or created) Chastisement. There is another kind<br>of Vyavahara arising out of the dispute of litigants which also has<br>sprung from Brahman. Principally characterised by a belief in either of<br>the two parties, that Vyavahara is seen to be productive of good. There<br>is another kind of Vyavahara which has the Veda for its soul. It is also<br>said to have the Veda for its cause. There is, O tiger, among kings, a<br>(third) kind of Vyavahara which is connected with family customs but<br>which is consistent with the scriptures.[365] That Vyavahara which has,<br>as above, been said to be characterised by a belief in either of two<br>litigant parties, should be known by us as inhering in the king. It<br>should be also known by the name of Chastisement, as also by the name of<br>Evidence. Although Chastisement is seen to be regulated by Evidence, yet<br>it has been said to have its soul in Vyavahara. That which has been<br>called Vyavahara is really based upon Vedic precepts. That Vyavahara<br>which has been indicated to have the Vedas for its soul is Morality or<br>duty. It is also productive of good unto persons believing in duty and<br>morality, men of cleansed souls have spoken of that Vyavahara as they<br>have done of ordinary law.[366] The third kind of Vyavahara is also a<br>preceptor of men, and it has also its roots in the Veda, O Yudhishthira!<br>It upholds the three worlds. It has Truth for its soul and it is<br>productive of prosperity. That which is Chastisement has been seen by us<br>to be eternal Vyavahara. That which has been said to be Vyavahara is<br>verily the Veda. That which is the Veda is morality, duty. That which is<br>morality and duty is the path of Righteousness. This last it was which in<br>the beginning had been Grandsire Brahman, that Lord of all creatures.<br>Brahman is the Creator of the entire universe with the gods and Asura and<br>Rakshasas and human beings and snakes, and of every other thing. Hence<br>that Vyavahara which is characterised by a belief in either of two<br>litigant parties has also flowed from him. For this reason He has laid<br>down the following in respect of Vyavahara: Neither mother, nor father,<br>nor brother, nor wife, nor priest, is unpunishable with that king who<br>rules agreeably to his duty.
