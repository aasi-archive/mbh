                            "Suka said, 'I have now understood that there are two kinds of creation,<br>viz., one commencing with Kshara (which is universal), and which is from<br>the (universal) Soul. The other, consisting of the senses with their<br>objects, is traceable to the puissance of the knowledge. This last<br>transcends the other and is regarded to be the foremost.[987] I desire,<br>however, to once more hear of that course of righteousness which runs in<br>this world, regulated by the virtue of Time and according to which all<br>good men frame their conduct.[988] In the Vedas there are both kinds of<br>declarations, viz., do acts and avoid acts. How shall I succeed in<br>ascertaining the propriety of this or that? It behoveth thee to expound<br>this clearly.[989] Having obtained, through thy instructions, a thorough<br>knowledge of the course of conduct of human beings, having purified<br>myself by the practice of only righteousness, and having cleansed my<br>understanding, I shall, after casting off my body, behold the<br>indestructible Soul.'[990]<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'The course of conduct that was first established by Brahma<br>himself was duly observed by the wise and pious persons of old, viz., the<br>great Rishis of ancient times. The great Rishis conquer all the worlds by<br>the practice of Brahmacharya. Seeking all things that are good for<br>himself by fixing the mind on the knowledge,[991] practising severe<br>austerities by residing in the forest and subsisting on fruits and roots,<br>by treading on sacred spots, by practising universal benevolence, and by<br>going on his rounds of mendicancy at the proper time to the huts of<br>forest recluses when these become smokeless and the sound of the husking<br>rod is hushed, a person succeeds in attaining to Brahma.[992] Abstaining<br>from flattery and from bowing thy heads to others, and avoiding both good<br>and evil, live thou in the forest by thyself, appeasing hunger by any<br>means that comes by the way.'<br><br>"Suka said, 'The declarations of the Vedas (already referred to in<br>respect of acts) are, in the opinion of the vulgar, contradictory.<br>Whether this is authoritative or that is so, when there is this conflict,<br>how can they be said to be scriptural?[993] I desire to hear this: how<br>can both be regarded as authoritative? How, indeed, can Emancipation be<br>obtained without violating the ordinance about the obligatory character<br>of acts?'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed, the son of Gandhavati, viz., the<br>Rishi, applauding these words of his son possessed of immeasurable<br>energy, replied unto him, saying the following.'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'One that is a Brahmacharin, one that leads a life of<br>domesticity, one that is a forest recluse, and one that leads a life of<br>(religious) mendicancy, all reach the same high end by duly observing the<br>duties of their respective modes of life. Or, if one and the same person,<br>freed from desire and aversion, practises (one after another) all these<br>four modes of life according to the ordinances that have been laid down,<br>he is certainly fitted (by such conduct) to understand Brahma. The four<br>modes of life constitute a ladder or flight of steps. That flight is<br>attached to Brahma. By ascending that Right one&#8212;succeeds in reaching the<br>region of Brahma. For the fourth part of his life, the Brahmacharin,<br>conversant&#8212;with the distinctions of duty and freed from malice, should<br>live with his preceptor or his preceptor's son. While residing in the<br>preceptor's house, he should go to bed after the preceptor has gone to<br>his, and rise therefrom before the preceptor rises from his.[994] All<br>such acts again as should be done by the disciple, as also those which<br>should be done by a menial servant, should be accomplished by him.<br>Finishing these he should humbly take his stand by the side of the<br>preceptor. Skilled in every kind of work, he should conduct himself like<br>a menial servant, doing every act for his preceptor. Having accomplished<br>all acts (without leaving any portion undone), he should study, sitting<br>at the feet of his preceptor, with eager desire to learn. He should<br>always behave with simplicity, avoid evil, speech, and take lessons only<br>when his preceptor invites him for it.[995] Become pure in body and mind,<br>and acquiring cleverness and other virtues, he should now and then speak<br>what is agreeable. Subduing his senses, he should look at his preceptor<br>without eyes of longing curiosity.[996] He should never eat before his<br>preceptor has eaten; never drink before his preceptor has drunk; never<br>sit down before his preceptor has sat down; and never go to bed before<br>his preceptor has gone to bed. He should gently touch his preceptor's<br>feet with upturned palms, the right foot with the right and the left with<br>the left. Reverentially saluting the preceptor, he should say unto him,<br>'O illustrious one, teach me. I shall accomplish this (work), O<br>illustrious one! This (other work) I have already accomplished. O<br>regenerate one, I am ready to accomplish whatever else thy reverend self<br>may be pleased to command.' Having said all this, and having duly offered<br>himself unto him (thus), he should accomplish whatever acts of his<br>preceptor wait for accomplishment, and having completed them inform the<br>preceptor once more of their completion. Whatever scents or tastes the<br>Brahmacharin may abstain from while actually leading a life of<br>Brahmacharya may be used by him after his return from the preceptor's<br>abode. This is consistent with the ordinance. Whatever observances have<br>been elaborately laid down for Brahmacharins (in the scriptures) should<br>all be regularly practised by him. He should, again, be always near his<br>preceptor (ready within call). Having contributed to his preceptor's<br>gratification in this way to the best of his powers, the disciple should,<br>from that mode of life, pass into the others (one after another) and<br>practise the duties of each. Having (thus) passed a fourth part of his<br>life in the study of the Vedas, and observance of vows and fasts, and<br>having given the preceptor the (final) fee, the disciple should,<br>according to the ordinance, take his leave and return home (for entering<br>into a life of domesticity).[997] Then, having taken spouses, obtaining<br>them in the ways indicated in the ordinances, and having carefully<br>established the domestic fire, he should, observant all the while of vows<br>and fasts, become a house-holder and pass the second period of life.'"
