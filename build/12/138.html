                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast, O bull of Bharata's race, said that that<br>intelligence which provides against the future, as well as that which can<br>meet present emergencies, is everywhere superior, while procrastination<br>brings about destruction. I desire, O grandsire, to hear of that superior<br>intelligence aided by which a king, conversant with the scriptures and<br>well versed with morality and profit, may not be stupefied even when<br>surrounded by many foes. I ask thee this, O chief of Kuru's race! It<br>behoveth thee to discourse to me on I his. I desire to hear everything,<br>comfortable to what has been laid down in the scriptures, about the<br>manner in which a king should conduct himself when he is assailed by many<br>foes. When a king falls into distress, a large number of foes, provoked<br>by his past acts, range themselves against him and seek to vanquish him.<br>How may, a king, weak and alone, succeed in holding up his head when he<br>is challenged on all sides by many powerful kings leagued together? How<br>does a king at such times make friends and foes? How should he, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, behave at such a time towards both friends and foes? When<br>those that have indications of friends really become his foes, what<br>should the king then do if he is to obtain happiness? With whom should he<br>make war and with whom should he make peace? Even if he be strong, how<br>should he behave in the midst of foes? O scorcher of foes, this I regard<br>to be the highest of all questions connected with the discharge of kingly<br>duties. There are few men for listening to the answer of this question<br>and none to answer it save Santanu's son, Bhishma, firmly wedded to truth<br>and having all his senses under control. O thou that art highly blessed<br>reflect upon it and discourse to me on it!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O Yudhishthira, this question is certainly worthy of<br>thee. Its answer is fraught with great happiness. Listen to me, O son, as<br>I declare to thee, O Bharata, all the duties generally known that should<br>be practised in seasons of distress. A foe becomes a friend and a friend<br>also becomes a foe. The course of human actions, through the combination<br>of circumstances, becomes very uncertain. As regards, therefore, what<br>should be done and what should not, it is necessary that paying heed to<br>the requirements of time and place, one should either trust one's foes or<br>make war. One should, even exerting, one's self to one's best, make<br>friends with men of intelligence and knowledge that desire one's welfare.<br>One should make peace with even one's foes, when, O Bharata, one's life<br>cannot otherwise be saved. That foolish man who never makes peace with<br>foes, never succeeds in winning any gain or acquiring any of those fruits<br>for which others endeavour. He again who makes peace with foes and<br>quarrels with even friends after a full consideration of circumstances,<br>succeeds in obtaining great fruits. In this connection is cited the old<br>story of the discourse between a cat and a mouse at the foot of a banian.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'There was a large banian in the midst of an<br>extensive forest. Covered with many kinds of creepers, it was the resort<br>of diverse kinds of birds. It had a large trunk from which numerous<br>branches extended in all directions. Delightful to look at, the shade it<br>afforded was very refreshing. It stood in the midst of the forest, and<br>animals of diverse species lived on it. A mouse of great wisdom, named<br>Palita, lived at the foot of that tree, having made a hole there with a<br>hundred outlets. On the branches of the tree there lived a cat, of the<br>name of Lomasa, in great happiness, daily devouring a large number of<br>birds. Some time after, a Chandala came into the forest and built a hut<br>for himself. Every evening after sunset he spread his traps. Indeed,<br>spreading his nets made of leathern strings he went back to his hut, and<br>happily passing the night in sleep, returned to the spot at the dawn of<br>day. Diverse kinds of animals fell into his traps every night. And it so<br>happened that one day the cat, in a moment of heedlessness, was caught in<br>the snare. O thou of great wisdom, when his foe the cat who was at all<br>times an enemy of the mouse species was thus caught in the net, the mouse<br>Palita came out of his hole and began to rove about fearlessly. While<br>trustfully roving through the forest in search of food, the mouse after a<br>little while saw the meat (that the Chandala had spread there as lure).<br>Getting upon the trap, the little animal began to eat the flesh. Laughing<br>mentally, he even got upon his enemy entangled helplessly in the net.<br>Intent on eating the flesh, he did not mark his own danger, for as he<br>suddenly cast his eyes he saw a terrible foe of his arrived at that spot.<br>That foe was none else than a restless mongoose of coppery eyes, of the<br>name of Harita. Living in underground holes, its body resembled the<br>flower of a reed. Allured to that spot by the scent of the mouse, the<br>animal came there with great speed for devouring his prey. And he stood<br>on his haunches, with head upraised, licking the corners of his mouth<br>with his tongue. The mouse beheld at the same time another foe living in<br>the trees, then sitting on the branch of the banian. It was a<br>night-prowling owl of the name of Chandraka of sharp beaks. Having become<br>an object of sight with both the mongoose and the owl, the mouse, in<br>great alarm, began to think in this strain: 'At such a season of great<br>danger, when death itself is staring me in the face, when there is fear<br>on every side, how should one act that wishes for one's good? Encompassed<br>on all sides by danger, seeing fear in every direction, the mouse, filled<br>with alarm for his safety, made a high resolution. Warding off even<br>innumerable dangers by hundreds of means, one should always save one's<br>life. Danger, at the present moment, encompasses me on every side. If I<br>were to descend from this trap on the ground, without adequate<br>precautions, the mongoose will surely seize and devour me. If I remain on<br>this trap, the owl will surely seize me. If, again, that cat succeeds in<br>disentangling himself from the net, he also is certain to devour me. It<br>is not proper, however, that a person of our intelligence should lose his<br>wits. I shall, therefore, strive my best to save my life, aided by proper<br>means and intelligence. A person possessed of intelligence and wisdom and<br>conversant with the science of policy never sinks, however great and<br>terrible the danger that threatens him. At present, however, I do not<br>behold any other refuge than this cat. He is an enemy. But he is in<br>distress. The service that I can do him is very great. Sought to be made<br>a prey by three foes, how should I now act for saving my life? I should<br>now seek the protection of one of those foes, viz., the cat. Taking the<br>aid of the science of policy, let me counsel the cat for his good, so<br>that I may, with my intelligence, escape from all the three. The cat is<br>my great foe, but the distress into which he has fallen is very great.<br>Let me try whether I can succeed in making this foolish creature<br>understand his own interests. Having fallen into such distress, he may<br>make peace with me. A person when afflicted by a stronger one should make<br>peace with even an enemy. Professors of the science of policy say that<br>even this should be the conduct of one who having fallen into distress<br>seeks the safety of his life. It is better to have a learned person for<br>an enemy than a fool for a friend. As regards myself, my life now rests<br>entirely in the hands of my enemy the cat. I shall now address the cat on<br>the subject of his own liberation. Perhaps, at this moment, it would not<br>be wrong to take the cat for an intelligent and learned foe.' Even thus<br>did that mouse, surrounded by foes, pursue his reflections. Having<br>reflected in this strain, the mouse, conversant with the science of<br>Profit and well acquainted with occasions when war should be declared and<br>peace made, gently addressed the cat, saying, 'I address thee in<br>friendship, O cat! Art thou alive? I wish thee to live! I desire the good<br>of us both. O amiable one, thou hast no cause for fear. Thou shalt live<br>in happiness. I shall rescue thee, if, indeed, thou dost not slay me.<br>There is an excellent expedient in this case, which suggests itself to<br>me, and by which you may obtain your escape and I may obtain great<br>benefit. By reflecting earnestly I have hit upon that expedient for thy<br>sake and for my sake, for it will benefit both of us. There are the<br>mongoose and the owl, both waiting with evil intent. Only so long, O cat,<br>as they do not attack me, is my life safe. There that wretched owl with<br>restless glances and horrid cries is eyeing me from the branch of that<br>tree. I am exceedingly frightened by it. Friendship, as regards the good,<br>is seven-paced.[409] Possessed of wisdom as thou art, thou art my friend.<br>I, shall act towards thee as a friend. Thou needst have no fear now.<br>Without my help, O cat, thou wilt not succeed in tearing the net. I,<br>however, shall cut the net for serving thee, if thou abstain from killing<br>me. Thou hast lived on this tree and I have lived at its foot. Both of us<br>have dwelt here for many long years. All this is known to thee. He upon<br>whom nobody places his trust, and he who never trusts another, are never<br>applauded by the wise. Both of them are unhappy. For this reason, let our<br>love for each other increase, and let there be union amongst us two. Men<br>of wisdom never applaud the endeavour to do an act when its opportunity<br>has passed away. Know that this is the proper time for such an<br>understanding amongst us. I wish that thou shouldst live, and thou also<br>wishest that I should live. A man crosses a deep and large river by a<br>piece of wood. It is seen that the man takes the piece of wood to the<br>other side, and the piece of wood also takes the man to the other side.<br>Like this, our compact, also will bring happiness to both of us. I will<br>rescue thee, and thou also wilt rescue me.' Having said these words that<br>were beneficial to both of them, that were fraught with reason and on<br>that account highly acceptable, the mouse Palita waited in expectation of<br>an answer.<br><br>"'Hearing these well-chosen words, fraught with reason and highly<br>acceptable, that the mouse said, the mouse's foe possessed of judgment<br>and forethought, viz., the cat spoke in reply. Endued with great<br>intelligence, and possessed of eloquence, the cat, reflecting upon his<br>own state, praised the Words of the speaker and honoured him by gentle<br>words in return. Possessed of sharp foreteeth and having eyes that<br>resembled the stones called lapis lazuli, the cat called Lomasa, gentle<br>eyeing the mouse, answered as follows: I am delighted with thee, O<br>amiable one! Blessed be thou that wishest me to live! Do that, without<br>hesitation, which thou thinkest to be of beneficial consequences. I am<br>certainly in great distress. Thou art, if possible, in greater distress<br>still. Let there be a compact between us without delay. I will do that<br>which is opportune and necessary for the accomplishment of our business,<br>O Puissant one! If thou rescuest me, the service will go for nothing I<br>place myself in thy hands. I am devoted to thee. I shall wait upon and<br>serve thee like a disciple. I seek thy protection and shall always obey<br>thy behests,' Thus addressed, the mouse Palita, addressing in return the<br>cat who was completely under his control, said these words of grave<br>import and high wisdom: 'Thou hast spoken most magnanimously. It could<br>scarcely be unexpected from one like thee. Listen to me as I disclose the<br>expedient I have hit upon for benefiting both of us. I will crouch myself<br>beneath thy body. I am exceedingly frightened at the mongoose. Do thou<br>save me. Kill me not. I am competent to rescue thee. Protect me also from<br>the owl, for that wretch too wishes to seize me for his prey. I shall cut<br>the noose that entangles thee. I swear by Truth, O friend!' Hearing these<br>judicious words fraught with reason, Lomasa, filled with delight, cast<br>his eyes upon Palita and applauded him with exclamations of welcome.<br>Having applauded Palita, the cat, disposed to friendliness, reflected for<br>a moment, and gladly said without losing any time, 'Come quickly to me!<br>Blessed be thou, thou art, indeed, a friend dear to me as life. O thou of<br>great I wisdom, through thy grace I have almost got back my life.<br>Whatever it is in my power to do for thee now, tell me and I shall do it.<br>Let there be peace between us, O friend! Liberated from this danger, I<br>shall, with all my friends and relatives, do all that may be agreeable<br>and beneficial to thee. O amiable one, freed from this distress, I shall<br>certainly seek to gladden thee, and worship and honour thee on every<br>occasion in return for thy services. A person by doing even abundant<br>services in return never becomes equal to the person that did him good in<br>the first instance. The former does those services for the sake of<br>services received. The latter, however, should be held to have acted<br>without any such motive.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The mouse, having thus made the cat understand his<br>own interests, trustfully crouched beneath his enemy's body. Possessed of<br>learning, and thus assured by the cat, the mouse trustfully laid himself<br>thus under the breast of the cat as if it were the lap of his father or<br>mother. Beholding him thus ensconced within the body of the cat, the<br>mongoose and the owl both became hopeless of seizing their prey. Indeed,<br>seeing that close intimacy between the mouse and the cat, both Harita and<br>Chandraka became alarmed and filled with wonder. Both of them had<br>strength and intelligence. Clever in seizing their prey, though near, the<br>mongoose and the owl felt unable to wean the mouse and the cat from that<br>compact. Indeed, beholding the cat and the mouse make that covenant for<br>accomplishing their mutual ends, the mongoose and the owl both left that<br>spot and went away to their respective abodes. After this, the mouse<br>Palita, conversant with the requirements of time and place, began, as he<br>lay under the body of the cat, to cut strings of the noose slowly,<br>waiting for the proper time to finish his work. Distressed by the strings<br>that entangled him, the cat became impatient upon seeing the mouse slowly<br>cutting away the noose. Beholding the mouse employed so slowly in the<br>work, the cat wishing to expedite him in the task, said: 'How is it, O<br>amiable one, that thou dost not proceed with haste in thy work? Dost thou<br>disregard me now, having thyself succeeded in thy object? O slayer of<br>foes, do thou cut these strings quickly. The hunter will soon come here.'<br>Thus addressed by the cat who had become impatient, the mouse possessed<br>of intelligence said these beneficial words fraught with his own good<br>unto the cat who did not seem to possess much wisdom: 'Wait in silence, O<br>amiable one! Expedition is not necessary. Drive all thy fears. We know<br>the requirements of time. We are not wasting time. When an act is begun<br>at an improper time, it never becomes profitable when accomplished. That<br>act, on the other hand, which is begun at the proper time, always<br>produces splendid fruits. If thou be freed at an improper time, I shall<br>have to stand in great fear of thee. Therefore, do thou wait for the<br>proper time. Do not be impatient, O friend! When I shall see the hunter<br>approach towards this spot armed with weapons, I shall cut the strings at<br>that moment of fear to both of us. Freed then, thou wilt ascend the tree.<br>At that time thou wilt not think of anything else save the safety of thy<br>life. And when thou, O Lomasa, wilt fly away in fear, I shall enter my<br>hole and thou wilt get upon the tree.' Thus addressed by the mouse in<br>words that were beneficial to him, the cat, possessed of intelligence and<br>eloquence, and impatient of saving his life, replied unto the mouse in<br>the following words. Indeed, the cat, who had quickly and properly done<br>his own part of the covenant, addressing the mouse who was not<br>expeditious in discharging his part, said, 'I rescued thee from a great<br>danger with considerable promptness. Alas! honest persons never do the<br>business of their friends in this way. Filled with delight while doing<br>it, they do it otherwise. Thou shouldst do what is for my good with<br>greater expedition. O thou of great wisdom, do thou exert a little so<br>that good may be done to both of us. If, on the other hand, remembering<br>our former hostility thou art only suffering the time to slip away, know,<br>O wicked wight, that the consequence of this act of thine will surely be<br>to lessen the duration of thy own life![410] If I have ever, before this,<br>unconsciously done thee any wrong, thou shouldst not bear it in<br>remembrance. I beg thy forgiveness. Be gratified with me.' After the cat<br>had said these words, the mouse, possessed of intelligence and wisdom and<br>knowledge of the scriptures, said these excellent words unto him: 'I<br>have, O cat, heard what thou hast said in furtherance of thy own object.<br>Listen, however, to me as I tell thee what is consistent with my own<br>objects. That friendship in which there is fear and which cannot be kept<br>up without fear, should be maintained with great caution like the hand<br>(of the snake-charmer) from the snake's fangs. The person that does not<br>protect himself after having made a covenant with a stronger individual,<br>finds that covenant to be productive of injury instead of benefit. Nobody<br>is anybody's friend; nobody is anybody's well-wisher; persons become<br>friends or foes only from motives of interest. Interest enlists interest<br>even as tame elephants catch wild individuals of their species. After,<br>again, an act has been accomplished, the doer is scarcely regarded. For<br>this reason, all acts should be so done that something may remain to be<br>done. When I shall set thee free, thou wilt, afflicted by the fear of the<br>hunter, fly away for thy life without ever thinking of seizing me.<br>Behold, all the strings of this net have been cut by me. Only one remains<br>to be cut. I will cut that also with haste. Be comforted, O Lomasa!'<br>While the mouse and the cat were thus talking with each other, both in<br>serious danger, the night gradually wore away. A great fear, however,<br>penetrated the heart of the cat. When at last morning came, the Chandala,<br>whose name was Parigha, appeared on the scene. His visage was frightful.<br>His hair was black and tawny. His hips were very, large and his aspect<br>was very fierce. Of a large mouth that extended from car to car, and<br>exceedingly filthy, his ears were very long. Armed with weapons and<br>accompanied by a pack of dogs, the grim-looking man appeared on the<br>scene. Beholding the individual who resembled a messenger of Yama, the<br>cat became filled with fear. Penetrated with fright, he addressed Palita<br>and said, 'What shalt thou do now?' The mouse very quickly cut the<br>remaining string that held fast the cat. Freed from the noose, the cat<br>ran with speed and got upon the banian. Palita also, freed from that<br>situation of danger and from the presence of a terrible foe, quickly fled<br>and entered his hole. Lomasa meanwhile had climbed the high tree. The<br>hunter, seeing everything, took tip his net. His hopes frustrated, he<br>also quickly left that spot. Indeed, O bull of Bharata's race, the<br>Chandala returned to his abode. Liberated from that great peril, and<br>having obtained back his life which is so very valuable, the cat from the<br>branches of that tree addressed the mouse Palita then staying within the<br>hole, and said, 'Without having conversed with me, thou hast suddenly run<br>away. I hope thou dost not suspect me of any evil intent. I am certainly<br>grateful and thou hast done me a great service. Having inspired me with<br>trustfulness and having given me my life, why dost thou not approach me<br>at a time when friends should enjoy the sweetness of friendship? Having<br>made friends, he that forgets them afterwards, is regarded a wicked<br>person and never succeeds in obtaining friends at times of danger and<br>need. I have been, O friend, honoured and served by thee to the best of<br>thy power. It behoveth thee to enjoy the company of my poor self who has<br>become thy friend. Like disciples worshipping their preceptor, all the<br>friends I have, all my relatives and kinsmen, will honour and worship<br>thee. I myself too shall worship thee with all thy friends and kinsmen.<br>What grateful person is there that will not worship the giver of his<br>life? Be thou the lord of both my body and home. Be thou the disposer of<br>all my wealth and possessions. Be thou my honoured counsellor and do thou<br>rule me like a father. I swear by my life that thou hast no fear from us.<br>In intelligence thou art Usanas himself. By the power of thy<br>understanding thou hast conquered us. Possessed of the strength of<br>policy, thou hast given us our life.' Addressed in such soothing words by<br>the cat, the mouse, conversant with all that is productive of the highest<br>good, replied in these sweet words that were beneficial to himself: 'I<br>have heard, O Lomasa, all that thou hast said. Listen now as I say what<br>appears to me. Friends should be well examined. Foes also should be well<br>studied. In this world, a task like this is regarded by even the learned<br>as a difficult one depending upon acute intelligence. Friends assume the<br>guise of foes, and foes assume the guise of friends. When compacts of<br>friendship are formed, it is difficult for the parties to understand<br>whether the other parties are really moved by lust and wrath. There is no<br>such thing as a foe. There is no such thing in existence as a friend. It<br>is force of circumstances that creates friends and foes. He who regards<br>his own interests ensured as long as another person lives and thinks them<br>endangered when that other person will cease to live, takes that other<br>person for a friend and considers him so as long as those interests of<br>his are not clashed against. There is no condition that deserves<br>permanently the name either of friendship or hostility. Both friends and<br>foes arise from considerations of interest and gain. Friendship becomes<br>changed into enmity in the course of time. A foe also becomes a friend.<br>Self-interest is very powerful. He who reposes blind trust on friends and<br>always behaves with mistrust towards foes without paying any regard to<br>considerations of policy, finds his life to be unsafe. He who,<br>disregarding all considerations of policy, sets his heart upon an<br>affectionate union with either friends or foes, comes to be regarded as a<br>person whose understanding has been unhinged. One should not repose trust<br>upon a person undeserving of trust, nor should one trust too much a<br>person deserving of trust. The danger that arises from blind reposing of<br>confidence is such that it cuts the very roots (of the person that<br>reposes such confidence). The father, the mother, the son, the maternal<br>uncle, the sister's son, other relatives and kinsmen, are all guided by<br>considerations of interest and profit. Father and mother may be seen to<br>discard the dear son if fallen.[411] People take care of their own<br>selves. Behold the efficacy of self-interest. O thou that art possessed<br>of great wisdom, his escape is very difficult who immediately after he is<br>freed from danger seeks the means of his enemy's happiness. Thou camest<br>down from the tree-top to this very spot. Thou couldst not, from levity<br>of understanding, ascertain that a net had been spread here. A person,<br>possessed of levity of understanding, fails to protect his own self. How<br>can he protect others? Such a person, without doubt, ruins all his acts.<br>Thou tellest me in sweet words that I am very dear to thee. Hear me,<br>however, O friend, the reasons that exist on my side. One becomes dear<br>from an adequate cause. One becomes a foe from an adequate cause. This<br>whole world of creatures is moved by the desire of gain (in some form or<br>other). One never becomes dear to another (without cause). The friendship<br>between two uterine brothers, the love between husband and wife, depends<br>upon interest. I do not know any kind of affection between any persons<br>that does not rest upon some motive of self-interest. If, as is sometimes<br>seen, uterine brothers or husband and wife having quarrelled reunite<br>together from a natural affection, such a thing is not to be seen in<br>persons unconnected with one another. One becomes dear for one's<br>liberality. Another becomes dear for his sweet words. A third becomes so<br>in consequence of his religious acts. Generally, a person becomes dear<br>for the purpose he serves. The affection between us arose from a<br>sufficient cause. That cause exists no longer. On the other hand, from<br>adequate reason, that affection between us has come to an end. What is<br>that reason, I ask, for which I have become so dear to thee, besides thy<br>desire of making me thy prey? Thou shouldst know that I am not forgetful<br>of this. Time spoils reasons. Thou seekest thy own interests. Others,<br>however, Possessed of wisdom, understand their own interests. The world<br>rests upon the example of the wise. Thou shouldst not address such words<br>to a person possessed of learning and competent to understand his own<br>interests. Thou art powerful. The reason of this affection that thou<br>showest for me now is ill-timed. Guided, however, by my own interests, I<br>myself am firm in peace and war that are themselves very unstable. The<br>circumstances under which peace is to be made or war declared are changed<br>as quickly as the clouds change their form. This very day thou wert my<br>foe. This very day, again, thou wert my friend. This very day thou hast<br>once more become my enemy. Behold the levity of the considerations that<br>move living creatures. There was friendship between us as long as there<br>was reason for its existence. That reason, dependant upon time, has<br>passed away. Without it, that friendship also has passed away. Thou art<br>by nature my foe. From circumstances thou becomest my friend. That state<br>of things has passed away. The old state of enmity that is natural has<br>come back. Thoroughly conversant as I am with the dictates of policy that<br>have been thus laid down, tell me, why I should enter today, for thy<br>sake, the net that is spread for me. Through thy power I was freed from a<br>great danger. Through my power thou hast been freed from a similar<br>danger. Each of us has served the other. There is no need of uniting<br>ourselves again in friendly intercourse. O amiable one, the object thou<br>hadst hath been accomplished. The object I had has also been<br>accomplished. Thou hast now no use for me except to make me your meal. I<br>am thy food. Thou art the eater. I am weak. Thou art strong. There cannot<br>be a friendly union between us when we are situated so unequally. I<br>understand thy wisdom. Having been rescued from the net, thou applaudest<br>me so that thou mayst succeed in easily making a meal of me. Thou wert<br>entangled in the net for the sake of food. Thou hast been freed from it.<br>Thou feelest now the pangs of hunger. Having recourse to that wisdom<br>which arises from a study of the scriptures, thou seekest verily to eat<br>me up today. I know that thou art hungry. I know that this is thy hour<br>for taking food. Thou art seeking for thy prey, with thy eyes directed<br>towards me. Thou hast sons and wives. Thou seekest still friendly union<br>with me and wishest to treat me with affection and do me services. O<br>friend, I am incapable of acceding to this proposal. Seeing me with thee,<br>why will not thy dear spouse and thy loving children cheerfully eat me<br>up? I shall not, therefore, unite with thee in friendship. The reason no<br>longer exists for such a union. If, indeed, thou dost not forget my good<br>offices, think of what will be beneficial to me and be comfortable. What<br>person is there possessed of any wisdom that will place himself under the<br>power of a foe that is not distinguished for righteousness, that is in<br>pangs of hunger, and that is on the look-out for a prey? Be happy then, I<br>will presently leave thee. I am filled with alarm even if I behold thee<br>from a distance. I shall not mingle with thee, cease in thy attempts, O<br>Lomasa! If thou thinkest that I have done thee a service, follow then the<br>dictates of friendship when I may happen to rove trustfully or<br>heedlessly. Even that will be gratitude in thee. A residence near a<br>person possessed of strength and power is never applauded, even if the<br>danger that existed be regarded to have passed away. I should always<br>stand in fear of one more powerful than myself. If thou dost not seek thy<br>own interests (of the kind indicated), tell me then what is there that I<br>should do for thee. I shall certainly give thee everything except my<br>life. For protecting one's own self one should give up one's very<br>children, and kingdom, and jewels, and wealth. One should sacrifice one's<br>all for protecting one's own self. If a person lives he can recover all<br>the affluence that he may have to give unto foes for protecting his life.<br>It is not desirable to give up life like one's wealth. Indeed, one's own<br>self should always be protected by, as I have already said, giving up<br>one's wives and wealth. Persons who are mindful of protecting their own<br>selves and who do all their acts after a proper consideration and survey,<br>never incur danger as the consequence of their acts. They that are weak<br>always know him for a foe who is possessed of greater strength. Their<br>understanding, firm in the truths of the scriptures, never loses its<br>steadiness.'<br><br>"Thus rebuked soundly by the mouse Palita, the cat, blushing with shame,<br>addressed the mouse and said the following words."<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'Truly I swear by thee that to injure a friend is in my<br>estimation very censurable. I know thy wisdom. I know also that thou art<br>devoted to my good. Guided by the science of Profit, thou said that there<br>is cause for a breach between thee and me. It doth not behove thee,<br>however, O good friend, to take me for what I am not. I cherish a great<br>friendship for thee in consequence of thy having granted me my life. I<br>am, again, acquainted with duties. I am all appreciator of other people's<br>merits. I am very grateful for services received. I am devoted to the<br>service of friends. I am, again, especially devoted to thee. For these<br>reasons, O good friend, it behoveth thee to reunite thyself with me. If I<br>am commanded by thee, I can, with all my kinsmen and relatives, lay down<br>my very life. They that are possessed of learning and wisdom see ample<br>reason for placing their trust in persons of such mental disposition as<br>ourselves. O thou that art acquainted with the truths of morality, it<br>behoveth thee not to cherish any suspicion in respect of me.' Thus<br>addressed by the cat, the mouse reflecting a little, said these words of<br>grave import unto the former, 'Thou art exceedingly good. I have heard<br>all that thou hast said and am glad to hear thee. For all that, however,<br>I cannot trust thee. It is impossible for thee, by such eulogies or by<br>gifts of great wealth, to induce me to unite with thee again. I tell<br>thee, O friend, that they who are possessed of wisdom never place<br>themselves, when there is not sufficient reason, under the power of a<br>foe. A weak person having made a compact with a stronger one when both<br>are threatened by foes, should (when that common danger passes away)<br>conduct himself heedfully and by considerations of policy. Having gained<br>his object, the weaker of the two parties should not again repose<br>confidence on the stronger. One, should never trust a person who does not<br>deserve to be trusted. Nor should one repose blind confidence upon a<br>person deserving of trust. One should always endeavour to inspire others<br>with confidence in himself-. One should not, however, himself repose<br>confidence in foes. For these reasons one should, under all<br>circumstances, protect his own self. One's possessions and children and<br>everything are so long valuable as one is alive. In brief, the highest<br>truth of all treatises on policy is mistrust. For this reason, mistrust<br>of all is productive of the greatest good. However weak people may be, if<br>they mistrust their foes, the latter, even if strong, never succeed in<br>getting them under power. O cat, one like myself should always guard ones<br>life from persons like thee. Do thou also protect thy own life from the<br>Chandala whose rage has been excited.'[412] While the mouse thus spake,<br>the cat, frightened at the mention of the hunter, hastily leaving the<br>branch of the tree, ran away with great speed. Having thus displayed his<br>power of understanding, the mouse Palita also, conversant with the truths<br>of scripture and possessed of wisdom, entered another hole.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Even thus the mouse Palita, possessed of wisdom,<br>though weak and alone, succeeded in baffling many powerful foes. One<br>possessed of intelligence and learning should make peace with a powerful<br>foe. The mouse and the cat owed their escape to their reliance upon each<br>other's services. I have thus pointed out to thee the course of Kshatriya<br>duties at great length. Listen now to me in brief. When two persons who<br>were once engaged in hostilities make peace with each other, it is<br>certain that each of them has it in his heart to over-reach the other. In<br>such a case he that is possessed of wisdom succeeds by the power of his<br>understanding in over-reaching the other. He, on the other hand, who is<br>destitute of wisdom suffers himself, in consequence of his heedlessness,<br>to be over-reached by the wise. It is necessary, therefore, that, in fear<br>one should seem to be fearless, and while really mistrusting others one<br>should seem to be trustful. One who acts with such heedfulness never<br>trips, or tripping, is never ruined. When the time comes for it, one<br>should make peace with an enemy; and when the time comes, one should wage<br>war with even a friend. Even thus should one conduct oneself, O king, as<br>they have said that are conversant with the considerations of peace (and<br>war). Knowing this, O monarch, and bearing the truths of scripture in<br>mind, one should, with all his senses about one and without heedfulness,<br>act like a person in fear before the cause of fear actually presents<br>itself. One should, before the cause of fear has actually come, act like<br>a person in fear, and make peace with foes. Such fear and heedfulness<br>lead to keenness of understanding. If one acts like a man in fear before<br>the cause of fear is at hand, one is never filled with fear when that<br>cause is actually present. From the fear, however, of a person who always<br>acts with fearlessness, very great fear is seen to arise.[413] 'Never<br>cherish fear'&#8212;such a counsel should never be given to any one. The<br>person that cherishes fear moved by a consciousness of his weakness,<br>always seeks 'the counsel of wise and experienced men. For these reasons,<br>one should, when in fear, seem to be fearless, and when mistrusting<br>(others) should seem to be trustful. One should not, in view of even the<br>gravest acts, behave towards others with falsehood. Thus have I recited<br>to thee, O Yudhishthira, the old story (of the mouse and the cat). Having<br>listened to it, do thou act duly in the midst of thy friends and kinsmen.<br>Deriving from that story a high understanding, and learning the<br>difference between friend and foe and the proper time for war and peace,<br>thou wilt discover means of escape when overwhelmed with danger. Making<br>peace, at a time of common danger, with one that is powerful, thou<br>shouldst act with proper consideration in the matter of uniting thyself<br>with the foe (when the common danger has passed away). Indeed, having<br>gained thy object, thou shouldst not trust the foe again. This path of<br>policy is consistent with the aggregate of three (viz., Virtue, Profit,<br>and Pleasure), O king! Guided by this Sruti, do thou win prosperity by<br>once more protecting thy subjects. O son of Pandu, always seek the<br>companionship of Brahmanas in all thy acts. Brahmans constitute the great<br>source of benefit both in this world and the next. They are teachers of<br>duty and morality. They are always grateful, O puissant one! If<br>worshipped, they are sure to do thee good. Therefore, O king, thou<br>shouldst always worship them. Thou wilt then, O king, duly obtain<br>kingdom, great good, fame, achievement's and progeny in their proper<br>order. With eyes directed to this history of peace and war between the<br>mouse and the cat, this history couched in excellent words and capable of<br>sharpening the intelligence, a king should always conduct himself in the<br>midst of his foes.'"
