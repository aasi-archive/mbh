                            "Sthanu said, 'Know, O lord, that my solicitations to thee are on behalf<br>of the created beings of the universe. These beings have been created by<br>thee. Do not be angry with them, O grandsire! By the fire born of thy<br>energy, O illustrious one, all the created beings are being consumed.<br>Beholding them placed in such a plight, I am penetrated with compassion.<br>Do not be angry with them, O lord of the universe.'<br><br>"The lord of all created beings said, 'I am not angry, nor it is my wish<br>that all the created beings should cease to exist. It is only for<br>lightening the burthen of the earth that destruction is desirable. The<br>goddess Earth, afflicted with the weight of creatures, solicited me, O<br>Mahadeva, for destroying them, especially as She seemed to sink under<br>their burthen into the water. When after exercising my intelligence for<br>even a long while I could not hit upon the means by which to accomplish<br>the destruction of this overgrown population, it was then that wrath took<br>possession of my breast.'<br><br>"Sthanu said, 'Do not give way to wrath, O lord of the deities, with<br>respect to this matter about the destruction of living creatures. Be<br>gratified. Let not these mobile and immobile beings be destroyed. All<br>tanks, all kinds of grass and herbs, all immobile beings, and all mobile<br>creatures also of the four varieties, are being consumed. The whole<br>universe is about to be denuded of beings. Be gratified, O divine lord! O<br>thou of righteous heart, even this is the boon that I solicit at thy<br>hands. If destroyed, these creatures would not come back. Therefore, let<br>this energy of thine be neutralised by thy own energy. Actuated by<br>compassion for all created beings find some means so that, O Grandsire,<br>these living creatures may not burn. Oh, let not these living creatures<br>perish with even their descendants thus destroyed. Thou hast appointed me<br>as the presider over the consciousness of all living creatures, O lord of<br>all the lords of the universe. All this mobile and immobile universe of<br>life, O lord of the universe, hath sprung from thee. Pacifying thee, O<br>god of gods, I beg of thee that living creatures may repeatedly come back<br>into the world, undergoing repeated deaths.'<br><br>"Narada continued, 'Hearing these words of Sthanu, the divine Brahman of<br>restrained speech and mind himself suppressed that energy of his within<br>his own heart. Suppressing that fire that had been devastating the<br>universe, the illustrious Brahman, adored of all, and possessed of<br>illimitable puissance, then arranged for both birth and death in respect<br>of all living creatures. After the Selfborn had withdrawn and suppressed<br>that fire, there came out, from all the outlets of his body, a lady<br>attired in robes of black and red, with black eyes, black palms, wearing<br>a pair of excellent ear-rings, and adorned with celestial ornaments.<br>Having sprung from Brahman's body, the lady took her station on his<br>right. The two foremost of deities thereupon looked at her. Then, O king,<br>the puissant Selfborn, the original cause of all the worlds, saluted her<br>and said, 'O Death, slay these creatures of the universe. Filled with<br>anger and resolved to bring about the destruction of created beings, I<br>have called thee.[1110] Do thou, therefore, commence to destroy all<br>creatures foolish or learned. O lady, slay all created beings without<br>making exception in anybody's favour. At my command thou wilt win great<br>prosperity.' Thus addressed, the goddess, Death, adorned with a garland<br>of lotuses, began to reflect sorrowfully and shed copious tears. Without<br>allowing her tears, however, to fall down, she held them, O king, in her<br>joined palms. She then besought the Self-born, impelled by the desire of<br>doing good to mankind.'"
