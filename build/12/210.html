                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O sire, of that high yoga by which, O<br>Bharata, I may obtain Emancipation, O foremost of speakers, I desire to<br>know everything about that yoga truly.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative of the<br>discourse between a preceptor and his disciple on the subject of<br>Emancipation. There was a regenerate preceptor who was the foremost of<br>Rishis. He looked like a mass of splendour. Possessed of a high soul, he<br>was firm in truth and a complete master of his senses. Once on a time, a<br>disciple of great intelligence and close attention, desirous of obtaining<br>what was for his highest good, touched the preceptor's feet, and standing<br>with joined hands before him, said, If, O illustrious one, thou hast been<br>gratified with the worship I have offered thee, it behoveth thee to solve<br>a great doubt of mine. Whence am I and whence art thou? Tell me this<br>fully. Tell me also what is the final cause. Why also, O best of<br>regenerate ones, when the material cause in all beings is the same, their<br>origin and destruction happen in such dissimilar ways? It beseems thee, O<br>thou of great learning, also to explain the object of the declarations in<br>the Vedas (about difference of rites in respect of different classes of<br>men), the meaning of the injunctions of the Smritis and of those<br>injunctions which apply to all cases of men.'[715]<br><br>"The preceptor said, 'Listen, O disciple, O thou of great wisdom! This<br>that thou hast asked me is undisclosed in the very Vedas and is the<br>highest subject for thought or discourse. It is called Adhyatma and is<br>the most valuable of all branches of learning and of all sacred<br>institutes. Vasudeva is the Supreme (cause) of the universe. He is the<br>origin of the Vedas (viz., Om). He is Truth, Knowledge, Sacrifice,<br>Renunciation, Self-restraint, and Righteousness. Persons conversant with<br>the Vedas know Him as All-pervading, Eternal, Omnipresent, the Creator<br>and the Destroyer, the Unmanifest, Brahma, Immutable. Hear now the story<br>of Him who took his birth in Vrishni's race. A Brahmana should hear of<br>the greatness of that God of gods, viz., Him called Vishnu of<br>immeasurable energy, from the lips of Brahmanas. A person of the royal<br>order should hear it from persons of that order. One who is a Vaisya<br>should hear it from Vaisyas, and a high-souled Sudra should hear it from<br>Sudras. Thou deservest to hear it. Listen now to the auspicious account<br>of Krishna, that narrative which is the foremost of all narratives.<br>Vasudeva is the wheel of Time, without beginning and without end.<br>Existence and Non-existence are the attributes by which His real nature<br>is known. The universe revolves like a wheel depending upon that Lord of<br>all beings. O best of men, Kesava, that foremost of all beings, is said<br>to be that which is Indestructible, that which is Unmanifest, that which<br>is Immortal, Brahma, and Immutable. The highest of the high, and without<br>change or deterioration himself, he created the Pitris, the gods, the<br>Rishis, the Yakshas, the Rakshasas, the Nagas, the Asuras, and human<br>beings. It is He who also created the Vedas and the eternal duties and<br>customs of men. Having reduced everything into non-existence, he once<br>more, in the beginning of a (new) yuga, creates Prakriti (primordial<br>matter). As the diverse phenomena of the several seasons appear one after<br>another according to the season that comes, after the like manner<br>creatures start forth into existence at the beginning of every<br>(celestial) yuga. Corresponding with those creatures that start into life<br>is the knowledge of rules and duties that have for their object the<br>regulation of the world's course.[716] At the end of every (celestial)<br>yuga (when universal destruction sets in) the Vedas and all other<br>scriptures disappear (like the rest). In consequence of the grace of the<br>Self-born, the great Rishis, through their penances, first re-acquire the<br>lost Vedas and the scriptures. The Self-born (Brahman) first acquired the<br>Vedas. Their branches called the Angas were first acquired by (the<br>celestial preceptor) Vrihaspati. Bhrigu's son (Sukra) first acquired the<br>science of morality that is so beneficial for the universe. The science<br>of music was acquired by Narada; that of arms by Bharadwaja; the history<br>of the celestial Rishis by Gargya: that of medicine by the<br>dark-complexioned son of Atri. Diverse other Rishis, whose names are<br>connected therewith, promulgated diverse other sciences such as Nyaya,<br>Vaiseshika, Sankhya, Patanjala, etc. Let that Brahma which those Rishis<br>have indicated by arguments drawn from reason, by means of the Vedas, and<br>by inferences drawn from the direct evidence of the senses, be adored.,<br>Neither the gods nor the Rishis were (at first) able to apprehend Brahma<br>which is without beginning and which is the highest of the high. Only the<br>divine creator of all things, viz., the puissant Narayana, had knowledge<br>of Brahma. From Narayana, the Rishis, the foremost ones among the deities<br>and the Asuras, and the royal sages of old, derived the knowledge of that<br>highest remedy of the cure of sorrow. When primordial matter produces<br>existences through the action of the primal energy, the universe with all<br>its potencies begins to flow from it. From one lighted lamp thousands of<br>other lamps are capable of being lighted. After the same manner,<br>primordial matter produces thousands of existent things. In consequence,<br>again, of its infinity primordial matter is never exhausted. From the<br>Unmanifest flows the Understanding determined by acts. The Understanding<br>produces Consciousness. From Consciousness proceeds Space. From Space<br>proceeds Wind. From the Wind proceeds Heat. From Heat proceeds Water, and<br>from Water is produced the Earth. These eight constitute primordial<br>Prakriti. The universe rests on them. From those Eight have originated<br>the five organs of knowledge, the five organs of action, the five objects<br>of the (first five) organs, and the one, viz., the Mind, forming the<br>sixteenth, which is the result of their modification. The ear, the skin,<br>the two eyes, the tongue, and the nose are the five organs of knowledge.<br>The two feet, the lower duct, the organ of generation, the two arms, and<br>speech, are the five organs of action. Sound, touch, form, taste, and<br>smell are the five objects of the senses, covering all the things. The<br>Mind dwells upon all the senses and their objects. In the perception of<br>taste, it is the Mind that becomes the tongue, and in speech it is the<br>Mind that becomes words. Endued with the different senses, it is the Mind<br>that becomes all the objects that exist in its apprehension. These<br>sixteen, existing in their respective forms, should be known as deities.<br>These worship Him who creates all knowledge and dwells within the body.<br>Taste is the attribute of water; scent is the attribute of earth; hearing<br>is the attribute of space; vision is the attribute of fire or light; and<br>touch should be known as the attribute of the wind. This is the case with<br>all creatures at all times. The Mind, it has been said, is the attribute<br>of existence. Existence springs from the Unmanifest (of Prakriti) which,<br>every intelligent person should know, rests in That which is the Soul of<br>all existent beings. These existences, resting upon the supreme Divinity<br>that is above Prakriti and that is without any inclination for action,<br>uphold the entire universe of mobiles and immobiles. This sacred edifice<br>of nine doors[717] is endued with all these existences. That which is<br>high above them, viz., the Soul, dwells within it, pervading it all over.<br>For this reason, it is called Purusha. The Soul is without decay and not<br>subject to death. It has knowledge of what is manifest and what is<br>unmanifest. It is again all-pervading, possessed of attributes, subtile,<br>and the refuge of all existences and attributes. As a lamp discovers all<br>objects great or small (irrespective of its own size), after the same<br>manner the Soul dwells in all creatures as the principle of knowledge<br>(regardless of the attributes or accidents of those creatures). Urging<br>the ear to hear what it hears, it is the Soul that hears. Similarly,<br>employing the eye, it is the Soul that sees. This body furnishes the<br>means by which the Soul derives knowledge. The bodily organs are not the<br>doers, but it is the Soul that is the doer of all acts. There is fire in<br>wood, but it can never be seen by cutting open a piece of wood. After the<br>same manner, the Soul dwells within the body, but it can never be seen by<br>dissecting the body. The fire that dwells in wood may be seen by<br>employing proper means, viz., rubbing the wood with another piece of<br>wood. After the same manner, the Soul which dwells within the body may be<br>seen by employing proper means, viz., yoga. Water must exist in rivers.<br>Rays of light are always attached to the sun. After the same manner, the<br>Soul has a body. This connection does not cease because of the constant<br>succession of bodies that the Soul has to enter.[718] In a dream, the<br>Soul, endued with the fivefold senses, leaves the body and roves over<br>wide areas. After the same manner, when death ensues, the Soul (with the<br>senses in their subtile forms) passes out of one body for entering<br>another. The Soul is bound by its own former acts. Bound by its own acts<br>done in one state of existence, it attains to another state. Indeed, it<br>is led from one into another body by its own acts which are very powerful<br>in respect of their consequences. How the owner of a human body, leaving<br>off his body, enters another, and then again into another, how, indeed,<br>the entire range of beings is the result of their respective acts (of<br>past and present lives), I will presently tell you.'"
