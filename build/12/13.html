                            "Sahadeva said, 'By casting off all external objects only, O Bharata, one<br>does not attain to success. By casting off even mental attachments, the<br>attainment of success is doubtful.[29] Let that religious merit and that<br>happiness which are his who has cast off external objects but whose mind<br>still internally covets them, be the portion of our foes! On the other<br>hand, let that religious merit and that happiness which are his who<br>governs the earth, having cast off all internal attachments also, be the<br>portion of our friends. The word mama (mine), consisting of two letters,<br>is Death's self; white the opposite word na-mama (not mine), consisting<br>of three letters, is eternal Brahma.[30] Brahma and death, O king,<br>entering invisibly into every soul, without doubt, cause all creatures to<br>act. If this being, O Bharata, that is called Soul, be not ever subject<br>to destruction, then by destroying the bodies of creatures one cannot be<br>guilty of slaughter. If, on the other hand, the soul and the body of a<br>being are born or destroyed together, so that when the body is destroyed<br>the soul also is destroyed, then the way (prescribed in the scriptures)<br>of rites and acts would be futile. Therefore, driving away all doubts<br>about the immortality of the soul, the man of intelligence should adopt<br>that path which has been trodden by the righteous of old and older times.<br>The life of that king is certainly fruitless who having acquired the<br>entire earth with her mobile and immobile creatures, does not enjoy her.<br>As regards the man again who lives in the forest upon wild fruits and<br>roots, but whose attachment to things of the earth has not ceased, such a<br>one, O king, lives within the jaws of Death. Behold, O Bharata, the<br>hearts and the outward forms of all creatures to be but manifestations of<br>thy own. They that look upon all creatures as their own selves escape<br>from the great fear (of destruction).[31] Thou art my sire, thou art my<br>protector, thou art my brother, and thou art my senior and preceptor. It<br>behoveth thee, therefore, to forgive these incoherent utterances in<br>sorrow of a woe-stricken person. True or false, this that has been<br>uttered by are, O lord of earth, has been uttered from a due regard for<br>thee, O best of Bharatas, that I entertain!"
