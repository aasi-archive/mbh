                            "'Bhishma said, 'In this connection, O Yudhishthira, the old account of a<br>conversation between Vrihaspati and Sakra is cited.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'What is that one act, O regenerate one, by accomplishing<br>which with care, a person may become the object of regard with all<br>creatures and acquire great celebrity?'<br><br>"Vrihaspati said, 'Agreeableness of speech, O Sakra, is the one thing by<br>practising which a person may become an object of regard with all<br>creatures and acquire great celebrity. This is the one thing, O Sakra,<br>which gives happiness to all. By practising it, one may always obtain the<br>love of all creatures. The person who does not speak a word and whose<br>face is always furrowed with frowns, becomes an object of hatred with all<br>creatures. Abstention from agreeable speeches makes him so. That person<br>who, upon beholding others, addresses them first and does so with smiles<br>succeeds in making everyone gratified with him. Even gifts, if not made<br>with agreeable speeches, do not delight the recipients, like rice without<br>curry. If even the possessions of men, O Sakra, be taken away with sweet<br>speeches, such sweetness of behaviour succeeds in reconciling the robbed.<br>A king, therefore, that is desirous of even inflicting chastisement<br>should utter sweet words. Sweetness of speech never fails of its purpose,<br>while, at the same time it never pains any heart. A person of good acts<br>and good, agreeable, and sweet speeches, has no equal.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by his priest, Sakra began to act<br>according to those instructions. Do thou also, O son of Kunti, practise<br>this virtue."'
