                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, how the high-souled Suka of<br>austere penances took birth as the son of Vyasa, and how did he succeed<br>in attaining to the highest success? Upon what woman did Vyasa, endued<br>with wealth of asceticism, beget that son of his? We do not know who was<br>Suka's mother, nor do we know anything of the birth of that high-souled<br>ascetic. How was it that, when he was a mere boy, his mind became<br>directed to the knowledge of the subtile (Brahma)? Indeed, in this world<br>no second person can be seen in whom such predilections could be marked<br>at so early an age. I desire to hear all this in detail, O thou of great<br>intelligence. I am never satiated with hearing thy excellent and<br>nectar-like words. Tell me, O grandsire in their proper order, of the<br>greatness, and the knowledge of Suka and of his union with the (Supreme)<br>Soul!"<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The Rishis did not make merit depend upon years or<br>decrepitude or wealth or friends. They said that he amongst them was<br>great that studied the Vedas. All this that thou enquirest bout has<br>penances for its root. That penance, again, O son of Pandu, rises from<br>the subjugation of the senses. Without doubt, one incurs fault by giving<br>one's senses the reins. It is only by restraining them that one succeeds<br>in earning success. The merit that attaches to a thousand<br>Horse-sacrifices or a hundred Vajapeyas cannot come up to even a<br>sixteenth portion of the merit that arises from Yoga, I shall, on the<br>present occasion, recite to thee the circumstances of Suka's birth, the<br>fruits he won f his penances, and the foremost end he achieved (by his<br>acts), topics that are incapable of being understood by persons of<br>uncleansed soul. Once on a time on the summit of Meru adorned with<br>karnikara flowers, Mahadeva sported, accompanied by the terrible spirits<br>that were his associates. The daughter of the king of mountains, viz.,<br>the goddess Parvati, was also there. There at the close vicinity of that<br>summit, the Island-born (Vyasa) underwent extraordinary austerities. O<br>best of the Kurus, devoted to the practices of Yoga, the great ascetic<br>withdrawing himself by Yoga into his own Soul, and engaged in Dharana,<br>practised many austerities for the sake of (obtaining) a son. The prayer<br>he addressed to the great God was,&#8212;O puissant one, let me have a son<br>that will have he puissance of Fire and Earth and Water and Wind and<br>Space. Engaged in the austerest of penances, the Island-born Rishi begged<br>of that at God who is incapable of being approached by persons of<br>uncleansed souls, (not by words but) by his Yoga-resolution. The puissant<br>Vyasa remained there for a hundred years, subsisting on air alone,<br>engaged in adoring Mahadeva of multifarious form, the lord of Uma.<br>Thither all the regenerate Rishis and royal sages and the Regents of the<br>world and the Sadhyas along with the Vasus, and the Adityas, the Rudras,<br>and Surya and Chandramas, and the Maruts, and the Oceans, and the Rivers<br>and the Aswins, the Deities, the Gandharvas, and Narada and Parvata and<br>the Gandharva Viswavasu, and the Siddhas, and the Apsaras. There<br>Mahadeva, called also by the name of Rudra, sat, decked with an excellent<br>garland of Karnikara flowers, and blazed with effulgence like the Moon<br>with his rays. In those delightful and celestial woods populous with<br>deities and heavenly Rishis, the great Rishi remained, engaged in high<br>Yoga-contemplation, from desire of obtaining a son. His strength suffered<br>no diminution, nor did he feel any pain. At this the three worlds were<br>much amazed. While the Rishi, possessed of immeasurable energy, sat in<br>Yoga, his matted locks, in con-sequence of his energy, were seen to blaze<br>like flames of fire. The illustrious Markandeya it was from whom I heard<br>of this. He used always to recite to me the acts of the deities. It is<br>for this that the matted locks of the high-souled and (Island-born)<br>Krishna, thus emblazed by his energy on that occasion, seem to this day<br>to be endued with the complexion of fire. Gratified with such penances<br>and such devotion, O Bharata, of the Rishi, the great God resolved (to<br>grant him his wish). The Three-eyed deity, smiling with pleasure,<br>addressed him and said,&#8212;O Island-born one, thou shalt get a son like to<br>what thou wishest! Possessed of greatness, he shall be as pure as Fire,<br>as Wind, as Earth, as Water, and as Space! He shall be possessed of the<br>consciousness of his being Brahma's self; his understanding and soul<br>shall be devoted to Brahma, and he shall completely depend upon Brahma so<br>as to be identifiable with it!'"
