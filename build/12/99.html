                            "Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old story of the battle<br>between Pratardana and the ruler of Mithila. The ruler of Mithila, viz.,<br>Janaka, after installation in the sacrifice of battle, gladdened all his<br>troops (on the eve of fight). Listen to me, O as I recite the story.<br>Janaka, the high souled king of Mithila, conversant with the truth of<br>everything, showed both heaven and hell unto his own warriors. He<br>addressed them, saying, 'Behold, these are the regions, endued with great<br>splendour, for those that fight fearlessly. Full of Gandharva girls,<br>those regions are eternal and capable of granting every wish. There, on<br>the other side, are the regions of hell, intended for those that fly away<br>from battle. They would have to rot there for eternity in everlasting<br>ingloriousness. Resolved upon casting away your very lives, do ye conquer<br>your foes. Do not fall into inglorious hell. The laying down of life, (in<br>battle) constitutes, in respect of heroes, their happy door of heaven.'<br>Thus addressed by their king, O subjugator of hostile towns, the warriors<br>of Mithila, gladdening their rulers, vanquished their foes in battle.<br>They that are of firm souls should take their stand in the van of battle.<br>The car-warriors should be placed in the midst of elephants. Behind the<br>car-warriors should stand the horsemen. Behind the last should be placed<br>the foot-soldiers all accoutred in mail. That king who forms his array in<br>this manner always succeeds in vanquishing his foes. Therefore, O<br>Yudhishthira, the array of battle should always be thus formed. Filled<br>with rage, heroes desire to will blessedness in heaven by fighting<br>fairly. Like Makaras agitating the ocean, they agitate the ranks of the<br>foe. Assuring one another, they should gladden those (amongst them) that<br>are cheerless. The victor should protect the land newly conquered (from<br>acts of aggression). He should not cause his troops to pursue too much<br>the routed foe. The onset is irresistible of persons that rally after the<br>rout and that, despairing of safety, assail their pursuers. For this<br>reason, O king, thou shouldst not cause thy troops to pursue too much the<br>routed roe. Warriors of courage do not wish to strike them that run away<br>with speed. That is another reason why the routed foe should not be<br>pursued hotly. Things that are immobile are devoured by those that are<br>mobile; creatures that are toothless are devoured by those that have<br>teeth; water is drunk by the thirsty; cowards are devoured by heroes.<br>Cowards sustain defeat though they have, like the victors, similar backs<br>and stomachs and arms and legs. They that are afflicted with fear bend<br>their heads and joining their hands stay before those that are possessed<br>of courage. This world rests on the arms of heroes like a son on those of<br>his sire. He, therefore, that is a hero deserves respect under every<br>circumstance. There is nothing higher in the three worlds than heroism.<br>The hero protects and cherishes all, and all things depend upon the<br>hero.'"
