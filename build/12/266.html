                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou, O grandsire, art our highest preceptor in the<br>matter of all acts that are difficult of accomplishment (in consequence<br>of the commands of superiors on the one hand and the cruelty that is<br>involved in them on the other). I ask, how should one judge of an act in<br>respect of either one's obligation to do it or of abstaining from it? Is<br>it to be judged speedily or with delay?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old story of what<br>occurred with respect to Chirakarin born in the race of Angirasa. Twice<br>blessed be the man that reflects long before he acts. One that reflects<br>long before he acts is certainly possessed of great intelligence. Such a<br>man never offends in respect of any act. There was once a man of great<br>wisdom, of the name of Chirakarin, who was the son of Gautama. Reflecting<br>for a long time upon every consideration connected with proposed acts, he<br>used to do all he had to do. He came to be called by the name of<br>Chirakarin because he used to reflect long upon all matters, to remain<br>awake for a long time, to sleep for a long time, and to take a long time<br>in setting himself to the accomplishment of such acts as he accomplished.<br>The clamour of being an idle man stuck to him. He was also regarded as a<br>foolish person, by every person of a light understanding and destitute of<br>foresight. On a certain occasion, witnessing an act of great fault in his<br>wife, the sire Gautama passing over his other children, commanded in<br>wrath this Chirakarin, saying, 'Slay thou this woman.' Having said these<br>words without much reflection, the learned Gautama, that foremost of<br>persons engaged in the practice of Yoga, that highly blessed ascetic,<br>departed for the woods. Having after a long while assented to it, saying,<br>'So be it,' Chirakarin, in consequence of his very nature, and owing to<br>his habit of never accomplishing any act without long reflection, began<br>to think for a long while (upon the propriety or otherwise of what he was<br>commanded by his sire to do). How shall I obey the command of my sire and<br>yet how avoid slaying my mother? How shall I avoid sinking, like a wicked<br>person, into sin in this situation in which contradictory obligations are<br>dragging me into opposite directions? Obedience to the commands of the<br>sire constitutes the highest merit. The protection of the mother again is<br>a clear duty. The status of a son is fraught with dependence. How shall I<br>avoid being afflicted by sin? Who is there that can be happy after having<br>slain a woman, especially his mother? Who again can obtain prosperity and<br>fame by disregarding his own sire? Regard for the sire's behest is<br>obligatory. The protection of my mother is equally a duty. How shall I so<br>frame my conduct that both obligations may be discharged? The father<br>places his own self within the mother's womb and takes birth as the son,<br>for continuing his practices, conduct, name and race. I have been<br>begotten as a son by both my mother and my father. Knowing as I do my own<br>origin, why should I not have this knowledge (of my relationship with<br>both of them)? The words uttered by the sire while performing the initial<br>rite after birth, and those that were uttered by him on the occasion of<br>the subsidiary rite (after the return from the preceptor's abode) are<br>sufficient (evidence) for settling the reverence due to him and indeed,<br>confirm the reverence actually paid to him.[1203] In consequence of his<br>bringing up the son and instructing him, the sire is the son's foremost<br>of superiors and the highest religion. The very Vedas lay it down as<br>certain that the son should regard what the sire says as his highest<br>duty. Unto the sire the son is only a source of joy. Unto the son,<br>however, the sire is all in all. The body and all else that the son owns<br>have the sire alone for their giver. Hence, the behests of the sire<br>should be obeyed without ever questioning them in the least. The very<br>sins of one that obeys one's sire are cleansed (by such obedience). The<br>sire is the giver of all articles of food, of instructions in the Vedas,<br>and of all other knowledge regarding the world. (Prior to the son's<br>birth) the sire is the performer of such rites as Garbhadhana and<br>Simantonnayana.[1204] The sire is religion. The sire is heaven. The sire<br>is the highest penance. The sire being gratified, all the deities are<br>gratified. Whatever words are pronounced by the sire become blessings<br>that attach to the son. The words expressive of joy that the sire utters<br>cleanse the son of all his sins. The flower is seen to fall away from the<br>stalk. The fruit is seen to fall away from the tree. But the sire,<br>whatever his distress, moved by parental affection, never abandons the<br>son. These then are my reflections upon the reverence due from the son to<br>the sire. Unto the son the sire is not an ordinary object. I shall now<br>think upon (what is due to) the mother. Of this union of the five<br>(primal) elements in me due to my birth as a human being, the mother is<br>the (chief) cause as the firestick of fire.[1205] The mother is as the<br>fire-stick with respect to the bodies of all men. She is the panacea for<br>all kinds of calamities. The existence of the mother invests one with<br>protection; the reverse deprives one of all protection. The man who,<br>though divested of prosperity, enters his house, uttering the words, 'O<br>mother!'&#8212;hath not to indulge in grief. Nor doth decrepitude ever assail<br>him. A person whose mother exists, even if he happens to be possessed of<br>sons and grandsons and even if he counts a hundred years, looks like a<br>child of but two years of age. Able or disabled, lean or robust, the son<br>is always protected by the mother. None else, according to the ordinance,<br>is the son's protector. Then doth the son become old, then doth he become<br>stricken with grief, then doth the world look empty in his eyes, when he<br>becomes deprived of his mother. There is no shelter (protection against<br>the sun) like the mother. There is no refuge like the mother. There is no<br>defence like the mother. There is no one so dear as the mother. For<br>having borne him in her womb the mother is the son's Dhatri. For having<br>been the chief cause of his birth, she is his Janani. For having nursed<br>his young limbs into growth, she is called Amva. For bringing forth a<br>child possessed of courage she is called Virasu. For nursing and looking<br>after the son she is called Sura. The mother is one's own body. What<br>rational man is there that would slay his mother, to whose care alone it<br>is due that his own head did not lie on the street-side like a dry gourd?<br>When husband and wife unite themselves for procreation, the desire<br>cherished with respect to the (unborn) son are cherished by both, but in<br>respect of their fruition more depends upon the mother than on the<br>sire.[1206] The mother knows the family in which the son is born and the<br>father who has begotten him. From the moment of conception the mother<br>begins to show affection to her child and takes delight in her. (For this<br>reason, the son should behave equally towards her). On the other hand,<br>the scriptures declare that the offspring belongs to the father alone. If<br>men, after accepting the hands of wives in marriage and pledging<br>themselves to earn religious merit without being dissociated from them,<br>seek congress with other people's wives, they then cease to be worthy of<br>respect.[1207] The husband, because he supports the wife, is called<br>Bhartri, and, because he protects her, he is on that account called Pati.<br>When these two functions disappear from him, he ceases to be both Bhartri<br>and Pati.[1208] Then again woman can commit no fault. It is man only that<br>commits faults. By perpetrating an act of adultery, the man only becomes<br>stained with guilt.[1209] It has been said that the husband is the<br>highest object with the wife and the highest deity to her. My mother gave<br>up her sacred person to one that came to her in the form and guise of her<br>husband. Women can commit no fault. It is man who becomes stained with<br>fault. Indeed, in consequence of the natural weakness of the sex as<br>displayed in every act, and their liability to solicitation, women cannot<br>be regarded as offenders. Then again the sinfulness (in this case) is<br>evident of Indra himself who (by acting in the way he did) caused the<br>recollection of the request that had been made to him in days of yore by<br>woman (when a third part of the sin of Brahmanicide of which Indra<br>himself was guilty was cast upon her sex). There is no doubt that my<br>mother is innocent. She whom I have been commanded to slay is a woman.<br>That woman is again my mother. She occupies, therefore, a place of<br>greater reverence. The very beasts that are irrational know that the<br>mother is unslayable. The sire must be known to be a combination of all<br>the deities together. To the mother, however, attaches a combination of<br>all mortal creatures and all the deities.[1210]&#8212;In consequence of his<br>habit of reflecting long before acting, Gautama's son Chirakarin, by<br>indulging in those reflections, passed a long while (without<br>accomplishing the act he had been commanded by his sire to accomplish).<br>When many days had expired, his sire Gautama's returned. Endued with<br>great wisdom, Medhatithi of Gautama's race, engaged in the practice of<br>penances, came back (to his retreat), convinced, after having reflected<br>for that long time, of the impropriety of the chastisement he had<br>commanded to be inflicted upon his wife. Burning with grief and shedding<br>copious tears, for repentance had come to him in consequence of the<br>beneficial effects of that calmness of temper which is brought about by a<br>knowledge of the scriptures, he uttered these words, 'The lord of the<br>three worlds, viz., Purandara, came to my retreat, in the guise of a<br>Brahmana asking for hospitality. He was received by me with (proper)<br>words, and honoured with a (proper) welcome, and presented in due form<br>with water to wash his feet and the usual offerings of the Arghya. I also<br>granted him the rest he had asked for. I further told him that I had<br>obtained a protector in him. I thought that such conduct on my part would<br>induce him to behave towards me as a friend. When, however,<br>notwithstanding all this, he misbehaved himself, my wife Ahalya could not<br>be regarded to have committed any fault. It seems that neither my wife,<br>nor myself, nor Indra himself who while passing through the sky had<br>beheld my wife (and become deprived of his senses by her extraordinary<br>beauty), could be held to have offended. The blame really attaches to the<br>carelessness of my Yoga puissance.[1211] The sages have said that all<br>calamities spring from envy, which, in its turn, arises from error of<br>judgment. By that envy, also, I have been dragged from where I was and<br>plunged into an ocean of sin (in the form of wife-slaughter). Alas, I<br>have slain a woman,&#8212;a woman that is again my wife&#8212;one, that is, who, in<br>consequence of her sharing her lord's calamities came to be called by the<br>name of Vasita,&#8212;one that was called Bharya owing to the obligation I was<br>under of supporting her. Who is there that can rescue me from this sin?<br>Acting heedlessly I commanded the high-souled Chirakarin (to slay that<br>wife of mine). If on the present occasion he proves true to his name then<br>may he rescue me from this guilt. Twice blessed be thou, O Chirakaraka!<br>If on this occasion thou hast delayed accomplishing the work, then art<br>thou truly worthy of thy name. Rescue me, and thy mother, and the<br>penances I have achieved, as also thy own self, from grave sins. Be thou<br>really a Chirakaraka today! Ordinarily, in consequence of thy great<br>wisdom thou takest a long time for reflection before achieving any act.<br>Let not thy conduct be otherwise today! Be thou a true Chirakaraka today.<br>Thy mother had expected thy advent for a long time. For a long time did<br>she bear thee in her womb. O Chirakaraka, let thy habit of reflecting<br>long before acting be productive of beneficial results today. Perhaps, my<br>son Chirakaraka is delaying today (to achieve my bidding) in view of the<br>sorrow it would cause me (to see him execute that bidding). Perhaps, he<br>is sleeping over that bidding, bearing it in his heart (without any<br>intention of executing it promptly). Perhaps, he is delaying, in view of<br>the grief it would cause both him and me, reflecting upon the<br>circumstances of the case.' Indulging in such repentance, O king, the<br>great Rishi Gautama then beheld his son Chirakarin sitting near him.<br>Beholding his sire come back to their abode, the son Chirakarin,<br>overwhelmed with grief, cast away the weapon (he had taken up) and bowing<br>his head began to pacify Gautama. Observing his son prostrated before him<br>with bent head, and beholding also his wife almost petrified with shame,<br>the Rishi became filled with great joy. From that time the highsouled<br>Rishi, dwelling in that lone hermitage, did not live separately from his<br>spouse or his heedful son. Having uttered the command that his wife<br>should be slain he had gone away from his retreat for accomplishing some<br>purpose of his own. Since that time his son had stood in an humble<br>attitude, weapon in hand, for executing that command on his mother.<br>Beholding that his son prostrated at his feet, the sire thought that,<br>struck with fear, he was asking for pardon for the offence he had<br>committed in taking up a weapon (for killing his own mother). The sire<br>praised his son for a long time, and smelt his head for a long time, and<br>for a long time held him in a close embrace, and blessed him, uttering<br>the words, 'Do thou live long!' Then, filled with joy and contented with<br>what had occurred, Gautama, O thou of great wisdom, addressed his son and<br>said these words, 'Blessed be thou, O Chirakaraka! Do thou always reflect<br>long before acting. By thy delay in accomplishing my bidding thou hast<br>today made me happy for ever.' That learned and best of Rishis then<br>uttered these verses upon the subject of the merits of such cool men as<br>reflect for a long time before setting their hands to any action. If the<br>matter is the death of a friend, one should accomplish it after a long<br>while. If it is the abandonment of a project already begun, one should<br>abandon it after a long while. A friendship that is formed after a long<br>examination lasts for a long time. In giving way to wrath, to<br>haughtiness, to pride, to disputes, to sinful acts, and in accomplishing<br>all disagreeable tasks he that delays long deserves applause. When the<br>offence is not clearly proved against a relative, a friend, a servant, or<br>a wife, he that reflects long before inflicting the punishment is<br>applauded.' Thus, O Bharata, was Gautama pleased with his son, O thou of<br>Kuru's race, for that act of delay on the latter's part in doing the<br>former's bidding. In all acts a man should, in this way, reflect for a<br>long time and then settle what he should do. By conducting himself in<br>this way one is sure to avoid grief for a long time. That man who never<br>nurses his wrath for a long while, who reflects for a long time before<br>setting himself to the performance of any act, never does any act which<br>brings repentance. One should wait for a long while upon those that are<br>aged, and sitting near them show them reverence. One should attend to<br>one's duties for a long time and be engaged for a long while in<br>ascertaining them. Waiting for a long time upon those that are learned,<br>are reverentially serving for a long time those that are good in<br>behaviour, and keeping one's soul for a long while under proper<br>restraint, one succeeds in enjoying the respect of the world for a long<br>time. One engaged in instructing others on the subject of religion and<br>duty, should, when asked by another for information on those subjects,<br>take a long time to reflect before giving an answer. He may then avoid<br>indulging in repentance (for returning an incorrect answer whose<br>practical consequences may lead to sin).&#8212;As regards Gautama of austere<br>penances, that Rishi, having adored the deities for a long while in that<br>retreat of his, at last ascended to heaven with his son.'"
