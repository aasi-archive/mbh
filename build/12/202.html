                            "Manu said, 'From that eternal and undeteriorating One first sprang<br>Space; from space came Wind; from wind came Light; from light came Water;<br>from water sprang the Universe; and from the universe, all things that<br>occur in it. The bodies of all (earthly) things, (after dissolution),<br>first enter into water, thence to light or heat, thence to the wind, and<br>thence to space. They that seek Emancipation have not to return from<br>space. On the other hand, they attain to Brahma. The refuge of<br>Emancipation, viz., Brahma, is neither hot, nor cold, neither mild nor<br>fierce, neither sour nor astringent, neither sweet nor bitter. He is not<br>endued with sound, or scent, or form. He transcends all these and<br>everything, and is without dimensions.[664] The skin perceives touch; the<br>tongue, taste; the nose, scent; the ears, sounds; and the eyes, forms.<br>Men not conversant with Adhyatma succeed not in beholding what is above<br>these. Having withdrawn the tongue from tastes, the nose from scents, the<br>ears from touch, and the eyes from forms, one succeeds in beholding one's<br>own self (as independent of the senses and the mind and, therefore, of<br>attributes).[665] It hath been said that that which is the Cause of the<br>actor, the act, the material with which the act is done, the place and<br>the time of the act, and the inclinations and propensities in respect of<br>happiness and misery, is called the Self (or Soul). That which pervades<br>everything, which does everything (assuming the forms of living<br>creatures), that which exists in the universe even as the mantras<br>declare,[666] that which is the cause of all, that which is the highest<br>of the high, and that which is One without a second and does all things,<br>is the Cause. Everything else is effect. It is seen that a person, in<br>consequence of the acts performed by him, obtains results both good and<br>evil, which (though apparently incompatible with each other, still) dwell<br>together in harmony. Indeed, as the good and evil fruits born of their<br>own acts dwell together in the bodies of creatures which are their<br>refuge, even so Knowledge dwells in the body.[667] As a lighted lamp,<br>while burning, discovers other objects before it, even so the five senses<br>which are like lamps set on high trees, find out their respective objects<br>when lighted by Knowledge.[668] As the various ministers of a king,<br>uniting together, give him counsel, even so the five senses that are in<br>the body are all subservient to Knowledge. The latter is superior to all<br>of them. As the flames of fire, the current of the wind, the rays of the<br>sun, and the waters of rivers, go and come repeatedly, even so the bodies<br>of embodied creatures are going and coming repeatedly.[669] As a person<br>by taking up an axe cannot, by cutting open a piece of wood, find either<br>smoke or fire in it, even so one cannot, by cutting open the arms and<br>feet and stomach of a person, see the principle of knowledge, which, of<br>course, has nothing in common with the stomach, the arms and the feet. As<br>again, one beholds both smoke and fire in wood by rubbing it against<br>another piece, so a person of well-directed intelligence and wisdom, by<br>uniting (by means of yoga) the senses and the soul, may view the Supreme<br>Soul which, of course, exists in its own nature.[670] As in the midst of<br>a dream one beholds one's own body lying on the ground as something<br>distinct from one's own self, even so a person, endued with the five<br>senses, the mind, and the understanding, beholds (after death) his own<br>body and then goes from one into another form[671]. The Soul is not<br>subject to birth, growth, decay, and destruction. In consequence of the<br>acts of life being endued with effects, the Soul, clothed in body, passes<br>from this body (when deprived of animation) into another, unseen by<br>others.[672] No one can behold with the eye the form of the Soul. The<br>Soul cannot, again, form the subject of any one's touch. With those<br>(i.e., the senses), the Soul accomplishes no act. The senses do not<br>approach the Soul. The Soul, however, apprehends them all. As anything,<br>placed in a blazing fire before a spectator, assumes a certain colour in<br>consequence of the light and heat that operates upon it, without taking<br>any other hue or attribute, even so the Soul's form is seen to take its<br>colour from the body. After the same manner, man, casting off one body,<br>enters another, unseen by all. Indeed, casting off his body to the (five)<br>great primal elements, he assumes a form that is similarly made of the<br>same (five) elements. The embodied creature (upon the destruction of his<br>body) enters space, wind, fire, water, and earth in such a way that each<br>particular element in his body mingles with the particular element (out<br>of his body) with whose nature it is consonant. The senses also, which<br>are engaged in diverse occupations and dependent on the five elements<br>(for the exercise of their functions), enter these five elements that<br>call forth their functions. The ear derives its capacity from space; and<br>the sense of scent from the earth. Form, which is the property of the<br>eye, is the consequence of light or fire. Fire or heat has been said to<br>be the dependent cause of water. The tongue which has for its property<br>taste becomes merged into water. The skin which has touch for its<br>property becomes lost in the wind whose nature it partakes. The fivefold<br>attributes, (viz., sound, etc.) dwell in the (five) great creatures<br>(viz., the five primal elements). Those fivefold objects of the senses<br>(viz., space, etc.) dwell in the (five) senses. All these again (viz.,<br>the fivefold attributes, the fivefold elements, and the five senses)<br>follow the lead of the mind. The mind follows the lead of the<br>Understanding, and the Understanding follows the lead of That which<br>exists in its true and undefiled nature (viz., the Supreme Soul).[673]<br>The doer in his new body receives all the good and bad acts done by him<br>as also all acts done by him in his past existence. All these acts done<br>in this life and the next ones to come follow the mind even as aquatic<br>animals pass along a genial current. As a quickly-moving and restless<br>thing becomes an object of sight, as a minute object appears to be<br>possessed of large dimensions (when seen through spectacles), as a mirror<br>shows a person his own face (which cannot otherwise be seen), even so the<br>Soul (though subtile and invisible) become an object of the<br>Understanding's apprehension.'"[674]
