                            "Bhishma said, 'Living creatures, by being attached to objects of the<br>senses which are always fraught with evil, become helpless. Those<br>high-souled persons, however, who are not attached to them, attain to the<br>highest end. The man of intelligence, beholding the world over-whelmed<br>with the evils constituted by birth, death, decrepitude, sorrow, disease,<br>and anxieties, should exert themselves for the attainment of<br>Emancipation. He should be pure in speech, thought, and body; he should<br>be free from pride. Of tranquil soul and possessed of knowledge, he<br>should lead a life of mendicancy, and pursue happiness without being<br>attached to any worldly object. Again, if attachment be seen to possess<br>the mind in consequence of compassion to creatures, he should, seeing<br>that the universe is the result of acts, show indifference in respect of<br>compassion itself.[755] Whatever good, acts are performed, or whatever<br>sin (is perpetrated), the doer tastes the consequences. Hence, one<br>should, in speech, thought, and deed, do only acts that are good.[756] He<br>succeeds in obtaining happiness who practises abstention from injuring<br>(others), truthfulness of speech, honesty towards all creatures, and<br>forgiveness, and who is never heedless. Hence one, exercising one's<br>intelligence, should dispose one's mind, after training it, on peace<br>towards all creatures.[757] That man who regards the practice of the<br>virtues enumerated above as the highest duty, as conducive to the<br>happiness of all creatures, and as destructive of all kinds of sorrow, is<br>possessed of the highest knowledge, and succeeds in obtaining happiness.<br>Hence (as already said), one should, exercising one's intelligence,<br>dispose one's mind, after training it, on peace towards all creatures.<br>One should never think of doing evil to others. One should not covet what<br>is far above one's power to attain. One should not turn one's thoughts<br>towards objects that are non-existent. One should, on the other hand,<br>direct one's mind towards knowledge by such persistent efforts as are<br>sure to succeed.[758] With the aid of the declarations of the Srutis and<br>of persistent efforts calculated to bring success, that Knowledge is sure<br>to flow. One that is desirous of saying good words or observing a<br>religion that is refined of all dross, should utter only truth that is<br>not fraught with any malice or censure. One that is possessed of a sound<br>heart should utter words that are not fraught with dishonesty, that are<br>not harsh, that are not cruel, that are not evil, and that are not<br>characterised by garrulity. The universe is bound in speech. If disposed<br>to renunciation (of all worldly objects) then should one proclaim,[759]<br>which a mind fraught with humility and a cleansed understanding, one's<br>own evil acts.[760] He who betakes himself to action, impelled thereto by<br>propensities fraught with the attribute of Passion, obtains much misery<br>in this world and at last sinks into hell. One should, therefore,<br>practise self-restraint in body, speech, and mind. Ignorant persons<br>bearing the burdens of the world are like robbers laden with their booty<br>of straggling sheep (secreted from herds taken out for pasture). The<br>latter are always regardful of roads that are unfavourable to them (owing<br>to the presence of the king's watch).[761] Indeed, as robbers have to<br>throw away their spoil if they wish for safety, even so should a person<br>cast off all acts dictated by Passion and Darkness if he is to obtain<br>felicity. Without doubt, a person that is without desire, free from the<br>bonds of the world, contented to live in solitude, abstemious in diet,<br>devoted to penances and with senses under control, that has burnt all his<br>sorrows by (the acquisition of) knowledge, that takes a pleasure in<br>practising all the particulars of yoga discipline, and that has a<br>cleansed soul, succeeds, in consequence of his mind being withdrawn into<br>itself, in attaining to Brahma or Emancipation.[762] One endued with<br>patience and a cleansed soul, should, without doubt, control one's<br>understanding. With the understanding (thus disciplined), one should next<br>control one's mind, and then with the mind overpower the objects of the<br>senses. Upon the mind being thus brought under control and the senses<br>being all subdued, the senses will become luminous and gladly enter into<br>Brahma. When one's senses are withdrawn into the mind, the result that<br>occurs is that Brahma becomes manifested in it. Indeed, when the senses<br>are destroyed., and the soul returns to the attribute of pure existence,<br>it comes to be regarded as transformed into Brahma. Then again, one<br>should never make a display of one's yoga power. On the other hand, one<br>should always exert to restrain one's senses by practising the rules of<br>yoga. Indeed, one engaged in the practice of yoga rules should do all<br>those acts by which one's conduct and disposition may become pure.[763]<br>(Without making one's yoga powers the means of one's subsistence) one<br>should rather live upon broken grains of corn, ripe beans, dry cakes of<br>seeds from which the oil has been pressed out, pot-herbs, half-ripe<br>barley, flour of fried pulses, fruits, and roots, obtained in alms.[764]<br>Reflecting upon the characteristics of time and place, one should<br>according to one's inclinations observe, after proper examination, vows<br>and rules about fasts. One should not suspend an observance that has been<br>begun. Like one slowly creating a fire, one should gradually extend an<br>act that is prompted by knowledge. By doing so, Brahma gradually shines<br>in one like the Sun. The Ignorance which has Knowledge for its resting<br>ground, extends its influence over all the three states (of waking,<br>dreaming and dreamless slumber). The Knowledge, again, that follows the<br>Understanding, is assailed by Ignorance.[765] The evil-hearted person<br>fails to obtain a knowledge of the Soul in consequence of taking it as<br>united with the three states although in reality it transcends them all.<br>When, however, he succeeds in apprehending the limits under which the<br>two, viz., union with the three states and separation from them, are<br>manifested, it is then that he becomes divested of attachment and attains<br>to Emancipation. When such an apprehension has been attained, one<br>transcends the effects of age, rises superior to the consequences of<br>decrepitude and death, and obtains Brahma which is eternal, deathless,<br>immutable, undeteriorating.'"
