                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Many persons here that are not really of tranquil<br>souls appear in outward form as men of tranquil souls. There are again<br>others that are really of tranquil souls but that appear to be otherwise.<br>How, O sire, shall we succeed in knowing these people?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is recited the old story of the<br>discourse between a tiger and a jackal. Listen to it, O Yudhishthira! In<br>ancient times, in a city called Purika, full of affluence, there was a<br>king named Paurika. That worst of beings was exceedingly cruel and took<br>delight in injuring others. On the expiry of the period of his life he<br>obtained an undesirable end. In fact, stained by the evil acts of his<br>human life, he was reborn as a jackal. Remembering his former prosperity,<br>he became filled with grief and abstained from meat even when brought<br>before him by others. And he became compassionate unto all creatures, and<br>truthful in speech, and firm in the observance of austere vows. At the<br>appointed time he took food which consisted of fruit that had dropped<br>from the trees. That jackal dwelt in a vast crematorium and liked to<br>dwell there. And as it was his birth place, he never wished to change it<br>for a finer locality. Unable to endure the purity of his behaviour, the<br>other members of his species, endeavoured to make him alter his resolve<br>by addressing him in the following words fraught with humility: 'Though<br>residing in this terrible crematorium, thou desirest yet to live in such<br>purity of behaviour. Is not this a perversity of understanding on thy<br>part, since thou art by nature an cater of carrion? Be thou our like. All<br>of us will give thee food. Eat that which ought always to be thy food,<br>abandoning such purity of conduct. Hearing these words of theirs, the<br>jackal replied unto them, with rapt attention, in these sweet words<br>fraught with reason and inculcating harmlessness to all: 'My birth has<br>been low. It is conduct, however, that determines the race.[341] I desire<br>to behave in such a way that my fame may spread. Although my habitation<br>is this crematorium, yet listen to my vows in respect of behaviour. One's<br>own self is the cause of one's acts. The mode of life to which one may<br>betake oneself is not the cause of one's religious acts. If one, while in<br>the observance of a particular mode of life, slays a Brahmana, will not<br>the sin of Brahmanicide attach to him? If, on the other hand, one gives<br>away a cow while one is not in the observance of any particular mode of<br>life, will that pious gift produce no merit? Moved by the desire of<br>getting what is agreeable, ye are engaged in only filling your stomachs.<br>Stupefied by folly ye do not see the three faults that are in the end. I<br>do not like to adopt the life led by you, fraught as it is with evil both<br>here and hereafter, and characterised as it is by such censurable loss of<br>virtue occasioned by discontentment and temptation.' A tiger, celebrated<br>for prowess, happened to overhear this conversation, and accordingly,<br>taking the jackal for a learned person of pure behaviour, offered him<br>such respectful worship as was suited to his own self and then expressed<br>a wish for appointing him his minister.'<br><br>"The tiger said, 'O righteous personage, I know what thou art. Do thou<br>attend to the duties of government with myself. Enjoy whatever articles<br>may be desired by thee, abandoning whatever may not suit thy taste.[342]<br>As regards ourselves, we are known to be of a fierce disposition. We<br>inform thee beforehand of this. If thou behavest with mildness, thou wilt<br>be benefited and reap advantages for thyself.'&#8212;Honouring these words of<br>that high-souled lord of all animals, the jackal, hanging down his head a<br>little, said these words fraught with humility.'<br><br>"The jackal said, 'O king of beasts, these words of thine with reference<br>to myself are such as befit thee. It is also worthy of thee that thou<br>shouldst seek for ministers of pure behaviour and conversant with duties<br>and worldly affairs. Thou canst not maintain thy greatness without a<br>pious minister, O hero, or with a wicked minister that is on the look-out<br>for putting an end to the very life. Thou shouldst, O highly blessed one,<br>regard those amongst thy ministers that are devoted to thee, that are<br>conversant with policy, that are independent of one another, desirous of<br>crowning thee with victory, unstained by covetousness, free from deceit,<br>possessed of wisdom ever engaged in thy good, and endued with great<br>mental vigour, even as thou regardest thy preceptors or parents. But, O<br>king of beasts, as I am perfectly contented with my present position, I<br>do not desire to change it for anything else. I do not covet luxurious<br>enjoyments or the happiness that arises from them. My conduct, again, may<br>not agree with that of thy old servants. If they happen to be of wicked<br>conduct, they will produce disunion between thee and me. Dependence upon<br>another, even if that other happens to be possessed of splendour, is not<br>desirable or praiseworthy. I am of cleansed soul, I am highly blessed. I<br>am incapable of showing severity to even sinners. I am of great<br>foresight. I have capacity for great exertion. I do not look at small<br>things. I am possessed of great strength. I am successful in acts. I<br>never act fruitlessly. I am adorned with every object of enjoyment. I am<br>never satisfied with a little. I have never served another. I am,<br>besides, unskilled in serving. I live according to my pleasure in the<br>woods. All who live by the side of kings have to endure great pain in<br>consequence of evil speeches against themselves. Those, however, that<br>reside in the woods pass their days, fearlessly and without anxiety, in<br>the observance of vows. The fear that arises in the heart of a person who<br>is summoned by the king is unknown to persons passing their days<br>contentedly in the woods, supporting life upon fruits and roots. Simple<br>food and drink obtained without effort, and luxurious food procured with<br>fear, widely differ from each other. Reflecting upon these two, I am of<br>opinion that there is happiness where there is no anxiety. A few only<br>amongst those that serve kings are justly punished for their offences. A<br>large number of them, however, suffer death under false accusations. If,<br>notwithstanding all this, thou appointest me, O king of beasts, as thy<br>minister, I wish to make a compact with thee in respect of the behaviour<br>thou shouldst always adopt towards me. Those words that I shall speak for<br>thy good should be listened to and regarded by thee. The provision which<br>thou wilt make for me shall not be interfered with by thee. I shall never<br>consult with thy other ministers. If I do, desirous of superiority as<br>they are they will then impute diverse kinds of faults to me. Meeting<br>with thee alone and in secret I shall say what is for thy good. In all<br>matters connected with thy kinsmen, thou shalt not ask me what is for thy<br>good or what is otherwise. Having consulted with me thou shalt not punish<br>thy other ministers afterwards, yielding to rage thou shalt not punish my<br>followers and dependants.' Thus addressed by the jackal, the king of<br>beasts answered him, saying, 'Let it be so,' and showed him every honour.<br>The jackal then accepted the ministership of the tiger. Beholding the<br>jackal treated with respect and honoured in all his acts, the old<br>servants of the king, conspiring together, began ceaselessly to display<br>their hatred towards him. Those wicked persons at first strove to gratify<br>and win him over with friendly behaviour and make him tolerate the<br>diverse abuses that existed in the taste. Despoilers of other people's<br>property, they had long lived in the enjoyment of their perquisites. Now,<br>however, being ruled by the jackal, they were unable to appropriate<br>anything belonging to others. Desirous of advancement and prosperity,<br>they began to tempt him with sweet speeches. Indeed, large bribes even<br>were offered to allure his heart. Possessed of great wisdom, the jackal<br>showed no signs of yielding to those temptations. Then some amongst them,<br>making a compact amongst themselves for effecting his destruction, took<br>away the well-dressed meat that was intended for and much desired by the<br>king of beasts, and placed it secretly in the house of the jackal. The<br>jackal knew who had stolen the meat and who had conspired to do it. But<br>though he knew everything, he tolerated it for a particular object. He<br>had made a compact with the king at the time of his accepting the<br>ministership, saying, 'Thou desirest my friendship, but thou shalt not, O<br>monarch, mistrust me without cause.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'When the king of beasts, feeling hungry, came to<br>eat, he saw not the meat that was to have been kept ready for his dinner.<br>The king then ordered, 'Let the thief be found out.' His deceitful<br>ministers represented unto him that the meat kept for him had been stolen<br>away by his learned minister, the jackal, that was so proud of his own<br>wisdom. Rearing Of this injudicious act on the part of the jackal, the<br>tiger became filled with rage. Indeed, the king, giving way to his wrath,<br>ordered his minister to be slain. Beholding the opportunity, the former<br>ministers addressed the king, saying, 'The jackal is ever ready to take<br>away from all of us the means of sustenance.' Having represented this<br>they once more spoke of the jackal's act of robbing the king of his food.<br>And they said, 'Such then is his act! What is there that he would not<br>venture to do? He is not as thou hadst heard. He is righteous in speech<br>but his real disposition is sinful. A wretch in reality, he has disguised<br>himself by putting on a garb of virtue. His behaviour is really sinful.<br>For serving his own ends he had practised austerities in the matter of<br>diet and of vows. If thou disbelievest this, we will give thee ocular<br>proof.' Having said this, they immediately caused that meat to be<br>discovered by entering the jackal's abode. Ascertaining that the meat was<br>brought back from the jackal's house and hearing all those<br>representations of his old servants, the king ordered, saying, 'Let the<br>jackal be slain.' Hearing these words of the tiger, his mother came to<br>that spot for awakening son's good sense with beneficial counsels. The<br>venerable dame said, 'O son, thou shouldst not accept this accusation<br>fraught with deceit. Wicked individuals impute faults to even an honest<br>person, moved by envy and rivalry. Enemies desirous of a quarrel cannot<br>endure the elevation of an enemy brought about by his high feats. Faults<br>are ascribed to even a person of pure soul engaged in penances. With<br>respect to even an ascetic living in the woods and employed in his own<br>(harmless) acts, are raised three parties, viz., friends, neutrals, and<br>foes. They that are rapacious hate them that are pure. The idle hate the<br>active. The unlearned hate the learned. The poor hate the rich. The<br>unrighteous hate the righteous. The ugly hate the beautiful. Many amongst<br>the learned, the unlearned, the rapacious, and the deceitful, would<br>falsely accuse an innocent person even if the latter happens to be<br>possessed of the virtues and intelligence of Vrihaspati himself. If meat<br>had really been stolen from thy house in thy absence, remember, the<br>jackal refuses to take any meat that is even given to him. Let this fact<br>be well considered (in finding out the thief). Wicked persons sometimes<br>put on the semblance of the good, and they that are good sometimes wear<br>the semblance of the wicked. Diverse kinds of aspect are noticeable in<br>creatures. It is, therefore, necessary to examine which is which. The<br>firmament seems to be like the solid base of a vessel. The fire-fly seems<br>to be like the actual spark of fire. In reality, however, the sky has no<br>base and there is no fire in the fire-fly. You see, there is necessity.<br>therefore, for scrutiny in respect of even such things as are addressed<br>to the eye. If a person ascertains everything after scrutiny, he is never<br>called upon to indulge in any kind of regret afterwards. It is not at all<br>difficult, O son, for a master to put his servant to death. Forgiveness,<br>however, in persons possessed of power, is always praiseworthy and<br>productive of renown. Thou hadst made the jackal thy first minister. In<br>consequence of that act, thou hadst earned great fame among all<br>neighbouring chiefs. A good minister cannot be obtained easily. The<br>jackal is thy well-wisher. Let him, therefore, be supported. The king who<br>regards a really innocent person falsely accused by his enemies to be<br>guilty, soon meets the destruction in consequence of the wicked ministers<br>that lead him to that conviction.' After the tiger's mother had concluded<br>her speech, a righteous agent of the jackal, stepping out of that phalanx<br>of his foes, discovered everything about the manner in which that false<br>accusation had been made. The jackal's innocence being made manifest, he<br>was acquitted and honoured by his master. The king of beasts<br>affectionately embraced him again and again. The jackal, however, who was<br>conversant with the science of policy, burning with grief, saluted the<br>king of beasts and solicited his permission for throwing away his life by<br>observing the Praya vow. The tiger, casting upon the virtuous jackal his<br>eyes expanded with affection and honouring hit' with reverential worship,<br>sought to dissuade him from the accomplishment of his wishes. The jackal,<br>beholding his master agitated with affection, bowed down to him and in a<br>voice choked with tears said these words: 'Honoured by thee first, I have<br>afterwards been insulted by thee. Thy behaviour towards me is calculated<br>to make me an enemy of thine. It is not proper therefore, that I should<br>any longer dwell with thee. Servants that are discontented, that have<br>been driven from their offices, or degraded from the honours that were<br>theirs, that have brought destitution upon themselves, or have been<br>ruined by their enemies (through the wrath of their master). that have<br>been weakened, that are rapacious, or enraged, or alarmed, or deceived<br>(in respect of their employers), that have suffered confiscation, that<br>are proud and desirous of achieving great feats but deprived of the means<br>or earning wealth, and that burn with grief or rage in consequence of any<br>injury done to them, always wait for calamities to overtake their<br>masters. Deceived, 'they leave their masters and become effective<br>instruments in the hands of foes.[343] I have been insulted by thee and<br>pulled down from my place. How wilt thou trust me again? How shall I (on<br>my part) continue to dwell with thee? Thinking me to be competent thou<br>tookest me, and having examined me thou hadst placed me in office.<br>Violating the compact then made (between us) thou hast insulted me. If<br>one speaks of a certain person before others as possessed of righteous<br>behaviour, one should not, if desirous of maintaining one's consistency.<br>afterwards describe the same person as wicked. I who have thus been<br>disregarded by thee cannot any longer enjoy thy confidence. On my part,<br>when I shall see thee withdraw thy confidence from me, I shalt be filled<br>with alarm and anxiety. Thyself suspicious and myself in alarm, our<br>enemies will be on the look-out for opportunities for injuring us. Thy<br>subjects will, as a consequence, become anxious and discontented. Such a<br>state of things has many faults. The wise do not regard that situation<br>happy in which there is honour first and dishonour afterwards. It is<br>difficult to reunite the two that have been separated, as, indeed, it is<br>difficult to separate the two that are united. If persons reunited after<br>separation approach one another again, their behaviour cannot be<br>affectionate. No servant is to be seen who is moved (in what he does) by<br>only the desire of benefiting his master. Service proceeds from the<br>motive of doing good to the master as also one's own self. All acts are<br>undertaken from selfish motives. Unselfish acts or motives are very rare.<br>Those kings whose hearts are restless and unquiet cannot acquire a true<br>knowledge of men. Only one in a hundred can be found who is either able<br>or fearless. The prosperity of men, as also their fall, comes of itself.<br>Prosperity and adversity, and greatness, all proceed from weakness of<br>understanding."[344]<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Having said these conciliatory words fraught with<br>virtue, pleasure, and profit, and having gratified the king, the jackal<br>retired to the forest. Without listening to the entreaties of the king of<br>beasts, the intelligent jackal cast off his body by sitting in praya and<br>proceeded to heaven (as the reward of his good deeds on earth).'"
