                            "The king said, 'I do not desire, O Brahmana, to support life by deceit<br>or fraud. I do not desire wealth, however great, which is to be earned by<br>unrighteous means. At the very outset of our present discourse I excepted<br>these means. By the adoption of only such means as would not lead to<br>censure, of such means as would benefit me in every respect, by<br>practising only such acts as are not harmful in their consequences, I<br>desire to live in this world.. I am incapable of adopting these ways that<br>thou pointest out to me. Indeed, these instructions do not become thee.'<br><br>"The sage said, 'These words, O Kshatriya, that thou speakest indicate<br>thee to be possessed of righteous feelings. Indeed, thou art righteous in<br>disposition and understanding, O thou of great experience. I shall strive<br>for the good of you both, viz., for thyself and him.[325] I shall cause a<br>union, eternal and incapable of breach, to be brought about between thee<br>and that king. Who is there that would not like to have a minister like<br>thee that art born of noble race, that abstainest from all acts of<br>unrighteousness and cruelty, that art possessed of great learning, and<br>that art well versed in the art of government and of conciliating all<br>persons? I say this because, O Kshatriya, though divested of kingdom and<br>plunged into great misery, thou still desirest to live adopting a<br>behaviour that is righteous. The ruler of the Videhas, firmly adhering to<br>truth, will come to my abode soon. Without doubt, he will do what I will<br>urge to do.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, "The sage, after this, inviting the ruler of the<br>Videhas, said these words unto him: 'This personage is of royal birth. I<br>know his very heart. His soul is as pure as the surface of mirror or the<br>disc of the autumnal moon. He has been examined by me in every way. I do<br>not see any fault in him. Let there be friendship between him and thee.<br>Do thou repose confidence on him as on myself. A king who is without a<br>(competent) minister cannot govern his kingdom even for three days. The<br>minister should be courageous as also possessed of great intelligence. By<br>these two qualities one may conquer both the worlds. Behold, O king,<br>these two qualities are necessary for ruling a kingdom. Righteous kings<br>have no such refuge as a minister possessed of such attributes. The<br>high-souled person is of royal descent. He walketh along, the path of the<br>righteous. This one who always keeps righteousness in view has been a<br>valuable acquisition. If treated by thee with honour, he will reduce all<br>thy foes to subjection. If he engages in battle with thee, he will do<br>what as a Kshatriya he should do. Indeed, if after the manner of his<br>sires and grandsires he fights for conquering thee, it will be thy duty<br>to fight him, observant as thou art of the Kshatriya duty of conquering<br>antagonists. Without engaging in battle, however, do thou, at my command,<br>employ him under thee from desire of benefiting thyself. Cast thy eyes on<br>righteousness, giving up covetousness that is improper. It behoveth thee<br>not to abandon the duties of thy order from lust or desire of battle.<br>Victory O sire, is not certain. Defeat also is not certain. Remembering<br>this, peace should be made with an enemy by giving him food and other<br>articles of enjoyment. One may see victory and defeat in his own case.<br>They that seek to exterminate a foe are sometimes exterminated themselves<br>in course of their efforts.' Thus addressed, king Janaka, properly<br>saluting and honouring that bull among Brahmanas who deserved every<br>honour, replied unto him, saying, 'Thou art of great learning and great<br>wisdom. That which thou hast said from desire of benefiting us, is<br>certainly advantageous for both of us. Such a course of conduct is highly<br>beneficial (to us). I have no hesitation in saying this. The ruler of<br>Videha then, addressing the prince of Kosala, said these words: 'In<br>observance of Kshatriya duties as also with aid of Policy, I have<br>conquered the world. I have, however, O best of kings, been conquered by<br>thee with thy good qualities. Without cherishing any sense of humiliation<br>(if thou remainest by my side), live thou with me as a victor.[326] I<br>honour thy intelligence, and I honour thy prowess. I do not disregard<br>thee, saying that I have conquered thee. On the other hand, live thou<br>with me as a victor. Honoured duly by me, O king, thou wilt go to my<br>abode. Both the kings then worshipped that Brahmana, and trusting each<br>other, proceeded to the capital of Mithila. The ruler of the Videhas,<br>causing the prince of Kosala to enter his abode, honoured him, who<br>deserved every honour, with offerings of water to wash his feet, honey<br>and curds and the usual articles. King Janaka also bestowed upon his<br>guest his own daughter and diverse kinds of gems and jewels. This (the<br>establishment of peace) is the high duty of kings; victory and defeat are<br>both uncertain.'"
