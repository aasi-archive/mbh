                            "Bhishma continued, 'Having said these words unto the Salmali. that<br>foremost of all persons conversant with Brahma, viz., Narada, represented<br>unto the god of the wind all that the Salmali had said about him.'<br><br>"Narada said, 'There is a certain Salmali on the breast of Himavat,<br>adorned with branches and leaves. His roots extend deep into the earth<br>and his branches spread wide around. That tree, O god of the wind<br>disregards thee. He spoke many words fraught with abuse of thyself. It is<br>not proper, O Wind, that I should repeat them in thy hearing. I know, O<br>Wind, that thou art the foremost of all created things. I know too that<br>thou art a very superior and very mighty being, and that in wrath thou<br>resemblest the Destroyer himself.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Hearing these words of Narada, the god of wind,<br>wending to that Salmali, addressed him in rage and said as follows.'<br><br>"The Wind-god said, 'O Salmali, thou hast spoken in derogation of me<br>before Narada. Know that I am the god of the wind. I shall certainly show<br>thee my power and might. I know thee well. Thou art no stranger to me.<br>The puissant Grandsire, while engaged in creating the world, had for a<br>time rested under thee. It is in consequence of this incident that I have<br>hitherto shown thee grace. O worst of trees, it is for this that thou<br>standest unharmed, and not in consequence of thy own might. Thou<br>regardest me lightly as if I were a vulgar thing. I shall show myself<br>unto thee in such a way that thou mayst not again disregard me.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed, the Salmali laughed in derision and<br>replied, saying, 'O god of the wind, thou art angry with me. Do not<br>forbear showing the extent of thy might. Do thou vomit all thy wrath upon<br>me. By giving way to thy wrath, what wilt thou do to me? Even if thy<br>might had, been thy own (instead of being derived), I would not still<br>have been afraid of thee. I am superior to thee in might. I should not be<br>afraid of thee. They are really strong in understanding. They, on the<br>other hand, are not to be regarded strong that are possessed of only<br>physical strength.' Thus addressed, the Wind-god said, 'Tomorrow I shall<br>test thy strength.' After this, night came. The Salmali, concluding<br>mentally what the extent is of the Wind's might and beholding his own<br>self to be inferior to the god, began to say to himself, 'All that I said<br>to Narada is false. I am certainly inferior in might to the Wind. Verity,<br>he is strong in his strength. The Wind, as Narada said, is always mighty.<br>Without doubt, I am weaker than other trees. But in intelligence no tree<br>is my equal. Therefore, relying upon my intelligence I shall look at this<br>fear that arises from the Wind. If the other trees in the forest all rely<br>upon the same kind of intelligence, then, verily, no injury can result to<br>them from the god of the Wind when he becomes angry. All of them.<br>however, are destitute of understanding, and, therefore, they do not<br>know, as I know, why or how the Wind succeeds in shaking and tearing them<br>up.'"
