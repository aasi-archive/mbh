                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, what is beneficial for one<br>that is unconversant with the truths of the scriptures, that is always in<br>doubt, and that abstains from self-restraint and the other practices<br>having for their object the knowledge of the Soul.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Worshipping the preceptor, always waiting reverentially<br>on those that are aged, and listening to the scriptures (when recited by<br>up competent Brahmanas),&#8212;these are said to be of supreme benefit (to a<br>person like the one thou hast described). In this connection also is<br>cited the old narrative of the discourse between Galava and the celestial<br>Rishi Narada. Once on a time Galava, desirous of obtaining what was for<br>his benefit, addressed Narada freed from error and fatigue, learned in<br>the scriptures, gratified with knowledge, a thorough master of his<br>senses, and with soul devoted to Yoga, and said, 'Those virtues, O Muni,<br>by the possession of which a person becomes respected in the world, I<br>see, dwell permanently in thee. Thou art freed from error and, as such,<br>it behoveth thee to remove the doubts that fill the minds of men like<br>ourselves that are subject to error and that are unacquainted with the<br>truths of the world. We do not know what we should do, for the<br>declarations of the scriptures generate an inclination for (the<br>acquisition of) Knowledge simultaneously with the inclination for acts.<br>It behoveth thee to discourse to us on these subjects.[1460] O<br>illustrious one, the different asramas approve different courses of<br>conduct.&#8212;_This_ is beneficial,&#8212;_This_ (other) is beneficial&#8212;the<br>scriptures exhort us often in this wise.[1461] Beholding the followers of<br>the four asramas, who are thus exhorted by the scriptures and who fully<br>approve of what the scriptures have laid down for them, thus travelling<br>in diverse courses, and seeing that ourselves also are equally content<br>with our own scriptures, we fail to understand what is truly beneficial.<br>If the scriptures were all uniform, then what is truly beneficial would<br>have become manifest. In consequence, however, of the scriptures being<br>multifarious, that which is truly beneficial becomes invested with<br>mystery. For these reasons, that which is truly beneficial seems to me to<br>be involved in confusion. Do thou then, O illustrious one, discourse to<br>me on the subject. I have approached thee (for this), O, instruct me!'<br><br>"Narada said, 'The Asramas are four in number, O child! All of them serve<br>the purposes for which they have been designed; and the duties they<br>preach differ from one another. Ascertaining them first from<br>well-qualified preceptors, reflect upon them, O Galava![1462] Behold, the<br>announcements of the merits of those Asramas are varied in respect of<br>their form, divergent in respect of their matter, and contradictory in<br>respect of the observances they embrace.[1463] Observed with gross<br>vision, verily, all the Asramas refuse to clearly yield their true intent<br>(which, of course, is knowledge of Self). Others, however, endued with<br>subtle sight, behold their highest end.[1464] That which is truly<br>beneficial, and about which there is no doubt, viz., good offices to<br>friends, and suppression of enemies, and the acquisition of the aggregate<br>of three (viz., Religion, Profit, and Pleasure), has been declared by the<br>wise to be supreme excellence.[1465] Abstention from sinful acts,<br>constancy of righteous disposition, good behaviour towards those that are<br>good and pious,&#8212;these, without doubt, constitute excellence. Mildness<br>towards all creatures, sincerity of behaviour, and the use of sweet<br>words,&#8212;these, without doubt, constitute excellence. An equitable<br>apportionment of what one has among the deities, the Pitris, and guests,<br>and adherence to servants,&#8212;these, without doubt, constitute excellence.<br>Truthfulness of speech is excellent. The knowledge, however, of truth, is<br>very difficult of acquisition. I say that that is truth which is<br>exceedingly beneficial to creatures.[1466] The renunciation of pride, the<br>suppression of heedlessness, contentment, living by one's own<br>self,&#8212;these are said to constitute supreme excellence. The study of the<br>Vedas, and of their branches, according to the well-known rules, and all<br>enquiries and pursuits having for their sake the acquisition of<br>knowledge,&#8212;these, without doubt, are excellent. One desirous of<br>achieving what is excellent should never enjoy sound and form and taste<br>and touch and scent, to excess and should not enjoy them for their sake<br>alone. Wandering in the night, sleep during the day, indulgence in<br>idleness, roguery, arrogance, excessive indulgence and total abstention<br>from all indulgence in objects of the senses, should be relinquished by<br>one desirous of achieving what is excellent.[1467] One should not seek<br>self-elevation by depreciating others. Indeed, one should, by one's<br>merits alone, seek distinction over persons that are distinguished but<br>never over those that are inferior. Men really destitute of merit and<br>filled with a sense of self-admiration depreciate men of real merit, by<br>asserting their own virtues and affluence. Swelling with a sense of their<br>own importance, these men, when none interferes with them (for bringing<br>them to a right sense of what they are), regard themselves to be superior<br>to men of real distinction. One possessed of real wisdom and endued with<br>real merits, acquires great fame by abstaining from speaking ill of<br>others and from indulging in self-praise. Flowers shed their pure and<br>sweet fragrance without trumpeting forth their own excellence. Similarly,<br>the effulgent Sun scatters his splendours in the firmament in perfect<br>silence. After the same manner those men blaze in the world with<br>celebrity who by the aid of their intelligence, cast off these and<br>similar other faults and who do not proclaim their own virtues. The fool<br>can never shine in the world by bruiting about his own praise. The man,<br>however, of real merit and learning obtains celebrity even if he be<br>concealed in a pit. Evil words, uttered with whatsoever vigour of voice<br>die out (in no time). Good words, uttered however softly, blaze forth in<br>the world. As the Sun shows his fiery form (in the gem called<br>Suryakanta), even so the multitude of words, of little sense, that fools<br>filled with vanity utter, display only (the meanness of) their hearts.<br>For these reasons, men seek the acquisition of wisdom of various kinds.<br>It seems to me that of all acquisitions that of wisdom is the most<br>valuable. One should not speak until one is asked; nor should one speak<br>when one is asked improperly. Even if possessed of intelligence and<br>knowledge, one should still sit in silence like an idiot (until one is<br>asked to speak and asked in proper form). One should seek to dwell among<br>honest men devoted to righteousness and liberality and the observance of<br>the duties of their own order. One desirous of achieving what is<br>excellent should never dwell in a place where a confusion occurs in the<br>duties of the several orders.[1468] A person may be seen to live who<br>abstains from all works (for earning the means of his living) and who is<br>well-content with whatever is got without exertion. By living amid the<br>righteous, one succeeds in acquiring pure righteousness. After the same<br>manner, one by living amid the sinful, becomes stained with sin.[1469] As<br>the touch of water or fire or the rays of the moon immediately conveys<br>the sensation of cold or heat, after the same manner the impressions of<br>virtue and vice become productive of happiness or misery. They that are<br>eaters of Vighasa eat without taking any notice of the flavours of the<br>edibles placed before them. They, however, that eat carefully<br>discriminating the flavours of the viands prepared for them, should be<br>known as persons still tied by the bonds of action.[1470] The righteous<br>man should leave that place where a Brahmana discourses on duties unto<br>disciples desirous of acquiring knowledge, as based on reasons, of the<br>Soul, but who do not enquire after such knowledge with reverence.[1471]<br>Who, however, will leave that spot where exists in its entirety that<br>behaviour between disciples and preceptors which is consistent with what<br>has been laid down in the scriptures? What learned man desirous of<br>respect being paid to himself will dwell in that place where people bruit<br>about the faults of the learned even when such have no foundation to<br>stand upon?[1472] Who is there that will not leave that place, like a<br>garment whose end has caught fire, where covetous men seek to break down<br>the barriers of virtue? One should remain and dwell in that place, among<br>good men of righteous disposition, where persons endued with humility are<br>engaged in fearlessly practising the duties of religion. There where men<br>practise the duties of religion for the sake of acquiring wealth and<br>other temporal advantages, one should not dwell, for the people of that<br>place are all to be regarded as sinful. One should fly away with all<br>speed from that place, as if from a room in which there is a snake, where<br>the inhabitants, desirous of obtaining the means of life, are engaged in<br>the practice of sinful deeds. One desirous of what is beneficial should,<br>from the beginning, relinquish that act in consequence of which one<br>becomes stretched, as it were, on a bed of thorn and in consequence of<br>which one becomes invested with the desires born of the deeds of past<br>lives.[1473] The righteous man should leave that kingdom where the king<br>and king's officers exercise equal authority and where they are given to<br>the habit of eating before feeding their relatives (when the latter come<br>as guests).[1474] One should dwell in that country where Brahmanas<br>possessed of a knowledge of the scriptures are fed first: where they are<br>always devoted to the due observance of religious duties, and where they<br>are engaged in teaching disciples and officiating at the sacrifices of<br>others. One should unhesitatingly dwell in that country where the sounds<br>Swaha, Swadha, and Vashat are duly and continuously uttered.[1475] One<br>should leave that kingdom, like poisoned meat, where one sees Brahmanas<br>obliged to betake themselves to unholy practices, being tortured by want<br>of the means of life. With a contented heart and deeming all his wishes<br>as already gratified a righteous man should dwell in that country whose<br>inhabitants cheerfully give away before even they are solicited. One<br>should live and move about, among good men devoted to acts of<br>righteousness, in that country where chastisement falleth upon those that<br>are wicked and where respect and good offices are the portion of those<br>that are of subdued and cleansed souls. One should unhesitatingly dwell<br>in that country whose king is devoted to virtue and which the king rules<br>virtuously, casting off desires and possessed of prosperity, and where<br>severe chastisement is dealt to those that visit self-controlled men with<br>the consequences of their wrath, those that act wickedly towards the<br>righteous, those that are given to acts of violence, and those that are<br>covetous.[1476] Kings endued with such a disposition bring about<br>prosperity to those that dwell in their kingdoms when prosperity is on<br>the point of leaving them.[1477] I have thus told thee, O son, in answer<br>to thy enquiry, what is beneficial or excellent. No one can describe, in<br>consequence of its exceedingly high character, what is beneficial or<br>excellent for the Soul.[1478] Many and high will the excellences be,<br>through the observance of the duties laid down for him, of the man who<br>for earning his livelihood during the time of his sojourn here conducts<br>himself in the way indicated above and who devotes his soul to the good<br>of all creatures.'"[1479]
