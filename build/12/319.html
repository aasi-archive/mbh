                            "Yajnavalkya said, 'Thou hast asked me, O monarch, of that Supreme Brahma<br>which resides in the Unmanifest. Thy question relates to a deep mystery.<br>Listen to me with close attention, O king! Having conducted myself with<br>humility according to the ordinances laid down by the Rishis I obtained<br>the Yajushes, O king, from Surya. Without the austerest penances I<br>formerly adored the heat-giving deity. The puissant Surya, O sinless one,<br>gratified with me, saying,&#8212;Solicit thou, O regenerate Rishi, the boon<br>upon which thou hast set thy heart, however, difficult it may be of<br>acquisition, I shall, with cheerful Soul, grant it to thee. It is very<br>difficult to incline me to grace! Bowing unto him with a bend of my head,<br>that foremost of heat-giving luminaries was addressed by me in these<br>words, I have no knowledge of the Yajushes. I desire to know them without<br>loss of time!&#8212;The holy one, thus solicited, told me,&#8212;I shall impart the<br>Yajushes unto thee. Made up of the essence of speech, the goddess<br>Saraswati will enter into thy body. The deity then commanded me to open<br>my mouth. I did as I was commanded. The goddess Saraswati then entered<br>into my body, O sinless one. At this, I began to burn. Unable to endure<br>the pain I plunged into a stream. Not understanding that what the<br>high-souled Surya had done for me was for my good, I became even angry<br>with him. While I was burning with the energy of the goddess, the holy<br>Surya told me,&#8212;Do thou endure this burning sensation for only a little<br>while. That will soon cease and thou wilt be cool. Indeed I became cool.<br>Seeing me restored to ease, the Maker of light said unto me,&#8212;The whole<br>Vedas, with even those parts that are regarded as its appendix, together<br>with the Upanishads, will appear in thee by inward light, O regenerate<br>one! The entire Satapathas also thou wilt edit, O foremost of regenerate<br>ones. After that, thy understanding will turn to the path of<br>Emancipation. Thou wilt also attain to that end which is desirable and<br>which is coveted by both Sankhyas and Yogins!&#8212;Having said these words<br>unto me, the divine Surya proceeded to the Asta hills. Hearing his last<br>words, and after he had departed from the spot where I was, I came home<br>in joy and then remembered the goddess Saraswati. Thought of by me, the<br>auspicious Saraswati appeared instantly before my eyes, adorned with all<br>the vowels and the consonants and having placed the syllable Om in the<br>van, I then, according to the ordinance, offered unto the goddess the<br>usual Arghya, and dedicated another to Surya, that foremost of all<br>heat-giving deities. Discharging this duty I took my seat, devoted to<br>both those deities. Thereupon, the entire Satapatha Brahmanas, with all<br>their mysteries and with all their abstracts as also their appendices,<br>appeared of themselves before my mental vision, at which I became filled<br>with great joy.[1661] I then taught them to a hundred good disciples and<br>thereby did what was disagreeable to my high-souled maternal uncle<br>(Vaisampayana) with the disciples gathered round him.[1662] Then shining<br>in the midst of my disciples like the Sun himself with his rays, I took<br>the management of the Sacrifice of thy high-souled sire, O king. In that<br>Sacrifice a dispute arose between me and my maternal uncle as to who<br>should be permitted to appropriate the Dakshina that was paid for the<br>recitation of the Vedas. In the very presence of Devala, I took half of<br>that Dakshina (the other half going to my maternal uncle). Thy sire and<br>Sumantra and Paila and Jaimini and other articles all acquiesced in that<br>arrangement.[1663]<br><br>'I had thus got from Surya the five times ten Yajushes, O monarch. I then<br>studied the Puranas with Romaharshan. Keeping before me those (original)<br>Mantras and the goddess Saraswati I, then, O king, aided by the<br>inspiration of Surya, set myself to compile the excellent Satapatha<br>Brahmanas, and succeeded in achieving the task never before undertaken by<br>any one else. That path which I had desired to take has been taken by me<br>and I have also taught it to my disciples. Indeed, the whole of those<br>Vedas with their abstracts have been imparted by me to those disciples of<br>mine. Pure in mind and body, all those disciples have, in consequence of<br>my instructions, become filled with joy. Having established (for the use<br>of others) this knowledge consisting of fifty branches which I had<br>obtained from Surya, I now meditate on the great object of that knowledge<br>viz., (Brahma). The Gandharva Viswavasu, well-conversant with the Vedanta<br>scriptures, desirous, O king, of ascertaining what is beneficial for the<br>Brahmanas in this knowledge and what truth occurs in it, and what is the<br>excellent object of this knowledge, one questioned me. He put to me<br>altogether four and twenty questions, O king, relating to the Vedas.<br>Finally, he asked me a question, numbered twenty-fifth which relates to<br>that branch of knowledge which is concerned with the inferences of<br>ratiocination. Those questions are as follows: What is universe and what<br>is not-universe? What is Aswa and what Aswa? What is Mitra? What is<br>Varuna? What is Knowledge? What is Object of knowledge? What is<br>Unintelligent? What is Intelligent? Who is Kah? Who is possessed of the<br>principle of change? Who is not possessed of the same? What is he that<br>devours the Sun and what is the Sun? What is Vidya and what is Avidya?<br>What is Immobile and what Mobile? What is without beginning, what is<br>Indestructible, and what is Destructible? These were the excellent<br>questions put to me by that foremost of Gandharvas. After king Viswavasu,<br>that foremost of Gandharvas, had asked me these questions one after<br>another, I answered them properly. At first, however, I told him, Wait<br>for a brief space of time, till I reflect on thy questions! So be it,<br>Gandharva said, and sat in silence. I then thought once again of the<br>goddess Saraswati in my mind. The replies then to those questions<br>naturally arose in my mind like butter from curds. Keeping in view the<br>high science of inferential ratiocination, I churned with my mind, O<br>monarch, the Upanishads and the supplementary scriptures relating to the<br>Vedas. The fourth science then that treats of Emancipation, O foremost of<br>kings, and on which I have already discoursed to thee, and which is based<br>upon the twenty-fifth, viz., Jiva, I then expounded to him.[1664] Having<br>said all this, O monarch, to king Viswavasu, I then addressed him,<br>saying, Listen now to the answers that I give unto the several questions<br>that thou hast put to me. I now turn to the question, which, O Gandharva,<br>thou askest, viz., What is Universe and what is not-universe? The<br>Universe is Unmanifest and original Prakriti endued with the principles<br>of birth and death which are terrible (to those that are desirous of<br>Emancipation). It is, besides, possessed of the three attributes (of<br>Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas), in consequence of its producing principles all<br>of which are fraught with those attributes.[1665] That which is<br>Not-universe is Purusha divested of all attributes. By Aswa and Aswa are<br>meant the female and the male, i.e., the former is Prakriti and the<br>latter is Purusha. Similarly, Mitra is Purusha, and Varuna is<br>Prakriti.[1666] Knowledge, again, is said to be Prakriti, while the<br>object to be known is called Purusha. The Ignorant (Jiva), and the<br>Knowing or Intelligent are both Purusha without attributes (for it is<br>Purusha that becomes Jiva when invested with Ignorance). Thou hast asked<br>what is Kah, who is endued with change and who is unendued therewith. I<br>answer, Kah is Purusha.[1667] That which is endued with change is<br>Prakriti. He that is not endued therewith is Purusha. Similarly, that<br>which is called Avidya (the unknowable) is Prakriti; and that which is<br>called Vidya is Purusha. Thou hast asked me about the Mobile and the<br>Immobile. Listen to what my answer is. That which is mobile is Prakriti,<br>which undergoing modification, constitutes the cause of Creation and<br>Destruction. The Immobile is Purusha, for without himself undergoing<br>modifications he assists at Creation and Destruction. (According to a<br>different system of philosophy) that which is Vedya is Prakriti; while<br>that which is Avedya is Purusha. Both Prakriti and Purusha are said to be<br>unintelligent, stable, indestructible, unborn, and eternal, according to<br>the conclusions arrived at by philosophers conversant with the topics<br>included in the name of Adhyatma. In consequence of the indestructibility<br>of Prakriti in the matter of Creation, Prakriti, which is unborn, is<br>regarded as not subject to decay or destruction. Purusha, again, is<br>indestructible and unchangeable, for change it has none. The attributes<br>that reside in Prakriti are destructible, but not Prakriti herself. The<br>learned, therefore, call Prakriti indestructible. Prakriti also, by<br>undergoing modifications, operates as the cause of Creation. The created<br>results appear and disappear, but not original Prakriti. Hence also is<br>Prakriti called indestructible. Thus have I told thee conclusions of the<br>Fourth Science based on the principles of ratiocinative inference and<br>having Emancipation for its end. Having acquired by the science of<br>ratiocinative inference and by waiting upon preceptors, the Rich, the<br>Samans, and the Yajushes, all the obligatory practices should be observed<br>and all the Vedas studied with reverence, O Viswavasu! O foremost of<br>Gandharvas, they who study the Vedas with all their branches but who do<br>not know the Supreme Soul from which all things take their birth and into<br>which all things merge when destruction comes, and which is the one<br>object whose knowledge the Vedas seek to inculcate, Indeed, they, who<br>have no acquaintance with that which the Vedas seek to establish, study<br>the Vedas to no purpose and bear their burthen of such study in vain. If<br>a person desirous of butter churns the milk of the she-ass, without<br>finding what he seeks he simply meets with a substance that is as foul of<br>smell as ordure. After the same manner, if one, having studied the Vedas,<br>fails to comprehend what is Prakriti and what is Purusha, one only proves<br>one's own foolishness of understanding and bears a useless burthen (in<br>the form of Vedic lore).[1668] One should, with devoted attention,<br>reflect on both Prakriti and Purusha, so that one may avoid repeated<br>birth and death. Reflection upon the fact of one's repeated births and<br>deaths and avoiding the religion of acts that is productive at best of<br>destructible results, one should betake oneself to the indestructible<br>religion of Yoga. O Kasyapa, if one continuously on the nature of the<br>Jiva-soul and its connection with the Supreme Soul, one then succeeds in<br>divesting oneself on all attributes and in beholding the Supreme Soul.<br>The Eternal and Unmanifest Supreme Soul is regarded by men of foolish<br>understandings to be different from the twenty-fifth or Jiva-soul. They<br>are endued with wisdom that behold both these as truly one and the same.<br>Frightened at repeated births and deaths, the Sankhyas and Yogins regard<br>the Jiva-soul and the Supreme Soul to be one and the same.'<br><br>"Viswavasu then said, 'Thou hast, O foremost of Brahmanas, said that<br>Jiva-soul is indestructible and truly undistinguished from the Supreme<br>Soul. This, however, is difficult to understand. It behoveth thee to once<br>more discourse on this topic to me. I have heard discourses on this<br>subject from Jaigishavya, Aista, Devala, the regenerate sage Parasara,<br>the intelligent Varshaganya, Bhrigu, Panchasikha Kapila, Suka, Gautama,<br>Arshtisena, the high-souled Garga, Narada, Asuri, the intelligent<br>Paulastya, Sanatkumara, the high-souled Sukra, and my sire Kasyapa.<br>Subsequently I heard the discourses of Rudra and the intelligent<br>Viswarupa, of several of the deities, of the Pitris. and the Daityas. I<br>have acquired all that they say, for they generally discourse that<br>eternal object of all knowledge. I desire, however, to hear what thou<br>mayst say on those topics with the aid of thy intelligence. Thou art the<br>foremost of all persons, and a learned lecturer on the scriptures, and<br>endued with great intelligence. There is nothing that is unknown to thee.<br>Thou art an ocean of the Srutis, as described, O Brahmana, in the world<br>of both the deities and Pitris. The great Rishis residing in the region<br>of Brahma say that Aditya himself, the eternal lord of all luminaries, is<br>thy preceptor (in the matter of this branch of knowledge). O Yajnavalkya,<br>thou hast obtained the entire science, O Brahmana, of the Sankhyas, as<br>also the scriptures of the Yogins in particular. Without doubt, thou art<br>enlightened, fully conversant with the mobile immobile universe. I desire<br>to hear thee discourse on that knowledge, which may be likened to<br>clarified butter endued with solid grains.'<br><br>"Yajnavalkya said, 'Thou art, O foremost of Gandharvas, competent to<br>comprehend every knowledge. As, however, thou askest me do thou hear me<br>then discourse to thee according as I myself have obtained it from my<br>preceptor. Prakriti, which is unintelligent, is apprehended by Jiva.<br>Jiva, however, cannot be apprehended by Prakriti, O Gandharva. In<br>consequence of Jiva being reflected in Prakriti, the latter is called<br>Pradhana by Sankhyas and Yogins conversant with the original principles<br>as indicated in the Srutis. O sinless one, the other, beholding, beholds<br>the twenty-fourth (Prakriti) and the twenty-fifth. (Soul); not beholding,<br>it beholds the twenty-sixth.[1669] The twenty-fifth thinks that there is<br>nothing higher than itself. In reality, however, though beholding, it<br>does not behold that (viz., the twenty-sixth) which beholds it.[1670] Men<br>possessed of wisdom should never accept the Twenty-fourth (viz.,<br>Prakriti, which is unintelligent or inert) as identifiable with the<br>Twenty-fifth or the Soul which has a real and independent existence. The<br>fish live in water. It goes thither impelled by its own nature. As the<br>fish, though living in the water, is to be regarded as separate from it,<br>after the same manner is the Twenty-fifth to be apprehended (i.e., though<br>the Twenty-fifth exists in a state of contact with the Twenty-fourth or<br>Prakriti, it is, however, in its real nature, separate from and<br>independent of Prakriti). When overwhelmed with the consciousness of meum<br>or self, and when unable to understand its identity with the<br>Twenty-sixth, in fact, in consequence of the illusion that invests it, of<br>its co-existence with Prakriti, and of its own manner of thinking, the<br>Jiva-soul always skins down, but when freed from such consciousness it<br>goes upwards. When the Jiva-soul succeeds in apprehending that it is one,<br>and Prakriti with which it resides is another, then only does it, O<br>regenerate one, succeed in beholding the Supreme Soul and attaining to<br>the condition of Oneness with the universe. The Supreme is one, O king,<br>and the Twenty-fifth (or Jiva-soul) is another. In consequence, however,<br>of the Supreme overlying the Jiva-soul the wise regard both to be one and<br>the same.[1671] For these reasons, Yogins, and followers of the Sankhya<br>system of philosophy, terrified by the birth and death, blessed with<br>sight of the Twenty-sixth, pure in body and mind, and devoted to the<br>Supreme Soul, and do not welcome the Jiva-soul as indestructible.[1672]<br>When one beholds the Supreme Soul and losing all consciousness of<br>individuality becomes identified with the Supreme, one than becomes<br>omniscient, and possessed of such omniscience one becomes freed from the<br>obligation of rebirth. I have thus discoursed to thee truly, sinless one,<br>about Prakriti which is unintelligent, and Jiva-soul which is possessed<br>of intelligence, and the Supreme Soul which is endued with omniscience,<br>according to the indications occurring in the Srutis. That man, who<br>beholds not any difference between the knower or the known, is both<br>Kevala and not-Kevala, is the original cause of the universe, is both<br>Jiva-soul and the Supreme Soul.[1673]<br><br>"Viswavasu said, 'O puissant one, thou hast duly and adequately<br>discoursed on that which is the origin of all the deities and which is<br>productive of Emancipation. Thou hast said what is true and excellent.<br>May inexhaustible blessings always attend thee, and may thy mind be ever<br>united with intelligence!'<br><br>"Yajnavalkya continued, 'Having said those words, the prince of<br>Gandharvas proceeded towards heaven, shining in resplendence of beauty.<br>Before leaving me, the high-souled one duly honoured me by taking the<br>accustomed turns round my person, and I looked upon him, highly pleased.<br>He inculcated the science he had obtained from me unto those celestials<br>that dwell in the regions of Brahman and other deities, unto those that<br>dwell on Earth, unto also the denizens of the nether regions, and unto<br>them that had adopted the path of Emancipation, O king. The Sankhyas are<br>devoted to the practices of their system. The Yogins are devoted to the<br>practices inculcated by their system. Others there are that are desirous<br>of achieving their Emancipation. Unto these latter this science is<br>productive of visible fruits, O lion among king. Emancipation flows from<br>Knowledge. Without Knowledge it can never be attained. The wise have said<br>it, O monarch. Hence, one should strive one's best for acquiring true<br>Knowledge in all its details, by which one may succeed in freeing oneself<br>from birth and death. Obtaining knowledge from a Brahmana or a Kshatriya<br>or Vaisya or even a Sudra who is of low birth, one endued with faith<br>should always show reverence for such knowledge. Birth and death cannot<br>assail one that is endued with faith. All orders of men are Brahmanas.<br>All are sprung from Brahma. All men utter Brahma.[1674] Aided by an<br>understanding that is derived from and directed to Brahma. I inculcated<br>this science treating of Prakriti and Purusha. Indeed, this whole<br>universe is Brahma. From the mouth of Brahma sprung the Brahmanas; from<br>his arms, sprung the Kshatriyas; from his navel, the Vaisya; and from his<br>feet, the Sudras. All the orders, (having sprung in this way) should not<br>be regarded as pilfering from one another. Impelled by Ignorance, all men<br>meet with death and attain, O king, to birth that is the cause of<br>acts.[1675] Divested of Knowledge, all orders of men, dragged by terrible<br>Ignorance, fall into varied orders of being due to the principles that<br>flow from Prakriti. For this reason, all should, by every means, seek to<br>acquire Knowledge. I have told thee that every person is entitled to<br>strive for its acquisition. One that is possessed of Knowledge is a<br>Brahmana. Others, (viz., Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras) are possessed<br>of knowledge. Hence, this science of Emancipation is always open to them<br>all. This, O king has been said by the Wise. The questions thou hadst<br>asked me have all been answered by me agreeably to the truth. Do thou,<br>therefore, cast off all grief. Go thou to the other end of this enquiry.<br>Thy questions were good. Blessings on thy head for ever!<br><br>"Bhishma continued&#8212;Thus instructed by the intelligent Yajnavalkya the<br>king of Mithila became filled with joy. The king honoured that foremost<br>of ascetics by walking round his person. Dismissed by the monarch, he<br>departed from his court. King Daivarati, having obtained the knowledge of<br>the religion of Emancipation, took his seat, and touching a million of<br>kine and a quantity of gold and a measure of gems and jewels, gave them<br>away unto a number of Brahmanas. Installing his son in the sovereignty of<br>the Videhas, the old king began to live, adopting the practices of the<br>Yatis. Thinking mainly of all ordinary duties and their derelictions (as<br>laid down in the scriptures), the king began to study the science of the<br>Sankhyas and the Yogins in their entirety. Regarding himself to be<br>Infinite, he began to reflect on only the Eternal and Independent One. He<br>cast off all ordinary duties and their derelictions, Virtue and Vice,<br>Truth and Falsehood, Birth and Death, and all other things appertaining<br>to the principles produced by Prakriti. Both Sankhyas and Yogins,<br>agreeably to the teachings of their sciences, regard this universe to be<br>due to the action of the Manifest and the Unmanifest. The learned say<br>that Brahma is freed from good and evil, is self-dependent, the highest<br>of the high, Eternal, and Pure. Do thou, therefore, O monarch, become<br>Pure! The giver, the receiver of the gift, the gift itself, and that<br>which is ordered to be given away, are all to be deemed as the unmanifest<br>Soul. The Soul is the Soul's one possession. Who, therefore, can be a<br>stranger to one? Do thou think always in this way. Never think otherwise.<br>He who does not know what is Prakriti possessed of attributes and what is<br>Purusha transcending attributes, only he, not possessed as he is of<br>knowledge, repairs to sacred waters and performs sacrifices. Not by study<br>of the Vedas, not by penances, not by sacrifices O son of Kuru, can one<br>attain to the status of Brahma. Only when one succeeds in apprehending<br>the Supreme or Unmanifest, one comes to be regarded with reverence. They<br>who wait upon Mahat attain to regions of Mahat. They who wait upon<br>Consciousness, attain to the spot that belongs to Consciousness. They who<br>wait upon what is higher attain to places that are higher than these.<br>Those persons, learned in the scriptures, who succeed in apprehending<br>Eternal Brahma who is higher than Unmanifest Prakriti, succeed in<br>obtaining that which transcends birth and death, which is free from<br>attributes, and which is both existent and non-existent I got all this<br>knowledge from Janaka. The latter had obtained it from Yajnavalkya.<br>Knowledge is very superior. Sacrifices cannot compare with it. With the<br>aid of Knowledge one succeeds in crossing the world's ocean which is full<br>of difficulties and dangers. One can never cross that ocean by means of<br>sacrifices. Birth and death, and other impediments, O king, men of<br>knowledge say, one cannot pass over by ordinary exertion.[1676] Men<br>attain to heaven through sacrifices, penances, vows, and observances. But<br>they have again to fall down therefrom on the Earth. Do thou, therefore,<br>adore with reverence that which is Supreme, most pure, blessed,<br>stainless, and sacred, and which transcends all states (being<br>Emancipation itself). By apprehending Kshetra, O king, and by performing<br>the Sacrifice that consists in the acquisition of Knowledge, thou wilt<br>really be wise. In former time, Yajnavalkya did that good to king Janaka<br>which is derivable from a study of the Upanishads. The Eternal and<br>Immutable Supreme was the topic about which the great Rishi had<br>discoursed to the king of Mithila. It enabled him to attain to that<br>Brahma which is auspicious, and immortal, and which transcends all kinds<br>of sorrow."
