                            "Bhishma said, 'Protection of the subject, O Yudhishthira, is the very<br>cheese of kingly duties. The divine Vrihaspati does not applaud any other<br>duty (so much as this one). The divine Kavi (Usanas) of large eyes and<br>austere penances, the thousand-eyed Indra, and Manu the son of Prachetas,<br>the divine Bharadwaja, and the saga Gaurasiras, all devoted to Brahma and<br>utterers of Brahma, have composed treatises on the duties of kings. All<br>of them praise the duty of protection, O foremost of virtuous persons, in<br>respect of kings. O thou of eyes like lotus leaves and of the hue of<br>copper, listen to the means by which protection may be secured. Those<br>means consist of the employment of spies and servants, giving them their<br>just dues without haughtiness, the realisation of taxes with<br>considerateness, never taking anything (from the subject) capriciously<br>and without cause, O Yudhishthira, the selection of honest men (for the<br>discharge of administrative functions), heroism, skill, and cleverness<br>(in the transaction of business), truth, seeking the good of the people,<br>producing discord and disunion among the enemy by fair or unfair means,<br>the repair of buildings that are old or on the point of falling away, the<br>infliction of corporal punishments and fines regulated by observance of<br>the occasion, never abandoning the honest, granting employment and<br>protection to persons of respectable birth, the storing of what should be<br>stored, companionship with persons of intelligence, always gratifying the<br>soldiery, supervision over the subjects, steadiness in the transaction of<br>business, filling the treasury, absence of blind confidence on the guards<br>of the city, producing disloyalty among the citizens of a hostile town,<br>carefully looking after the friends and allies living in the midst of the<br>enemy's country, strictly watching the servants and officers of the<br>state, personal observation of the city, distrust of servants, comforting<br>the enemy with assurances, steadily observing the dictates of policy,<br>readiness for action, never disregarding an enemy, and casting off those<br>that are wicked. Readiness for exertion in kings is the root of kingly<br>duties. This has been said by Vrihaspati. Listen to the verses sung by<br>him: 'By exertion the amrita was obtained; by exertion the Asuras were<br>slain, by exertion Indra himself obtained sovereignty in heaven and on<br>earth. The hero of exertion is superior to the heroes of speech. The<br>heroes of speech gratify and worship the heroes of exertion.[169]' The<br>king that is destitute of exertion, even if possessed of intelligence, is<br>always overcome by foes like a snake that is bereft of poison. The king,<br>even if possessed of strength, should not disregard a foe, however weak.<br>A spark of fire can produce a conflagration and a particle of poison can<br>kill. With only one kind of force, an enemy from within a fort, can<br>afflict the whole country of even a powerful and prosperous king. The<br>secret speeches of a king, the amassing of troops for obtaining victory,<br>the crooked purposes in his heart, similar intents for accomplishing<br>particular objects, and the wrong acts he does or intends to do, should<br>be concealed by putting on an appearance of candour. He should act<br>righteously for keeping his people under subjection. Persons of crooked<br>minds cannot bear the burden of extensive empire. A king who is mild<br>cannot obtain superior rank, the acquisition of which depends upon<br>labour. A kingdom, coveted by all like meat, can never be protected by<br>candour and simplicity. A king, O Yudhishthira, should, therefore, always<br>conduct himself with both candour and crookedness. If in protecting his<br>subjects a king falls into danger, he earns great merit. Even such should<br>be the conduct of kings. I have now told thee a portion only of the<br>duties of kings. Tell me, O best of the Kurus, what more you wish to<br>know."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "The illustrious Vyasa and Devasthana and Aswa,<br>and Vasudeva and Kripa and Satyaki and Sanjaya, filled with joy, and with<br>faces resembling full-blown flowers, said, 'Excellent! Excellent!' and<br>hymned the praises of that tiger among men, viz., Bhishma, that foremost<br>of virtuous persons. Then Yudhishthira, that chief of Kuru's race, with a<br>cheerless heart and eyes bathed in tears, gently touched Bhishma's feet<br>and said, 'O grandsire, I shall to-morrow enquire after those points<br>about which I have my doubts, for today, the sun, having sucked the<br>moisture of all terrestrial objects, is about to set.' Then Kesava and<br>Kripa and Yudhishthira and others, saluting the Brahmanas (assembled<br>there) and circumambulating the son of the great river, cheerfully<br>ascended their cars. All of them observant of excellent vows then bathed<br>in the current of the Drishadwati. Having offered oblations of water unto<br>their ancestors and silently recited the sacred mantras and done other<br>auspicious acts, and having performed the evening prayer with due rites,<br>those scorchers of foes entered the city called after the elephant."
