                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing these words of Arjuna, O chastiser of foes,<br>Nakula of mighty arms and a broad chest, temperate in speech and<br>possessed of great wisdom, with face whose colour then resembled that of<br>copper, looked at the king, that foremost of all righteous persons, and<br>spoke these words, besieging his brother's heart (with reason).'<br><br>"Nakula said, 'The very gods had established their fires in the region<br>called Visakha-yupa. Know, therefore, O king, that the gods themselves<br>depend upon the fruits of action.[20] The Pitris, that support (by rain)<br>the lives of even all disbelievers, observing the ordinances (of the<br>Creator as declared in the Vedas), are, O king, engaged in action.[21]<br>Know them for downright atheists that reject the declaration of the Vedas<br>(which inculcate action). The person that is learned in the Vedas, by<br>following their declarations in all his acts, attains, O Bharata, to the<br>highest region of heaven by the way of the deities.[22]<br><br>This (domestic mode of life again) has been said by all persons<br>acquainted with Vedic truths to be superior to all the (other) modes of<br>life. Knowing this, O king, that the person who in sacrifices gives away<br>his righteously acquired wealth unto those Brahmanas that are well<br>conversant with the Vedas, and restrains his soul, is, O monarch,<br>regarded as the true renouncer. He, however, who, disregarding (a life of<br>domesticity, that is) the source of much happiness, jumps to the next<br>mode of life,&#8212;that renouncer of his own self,[23] O monarch, is a<br>renouncer labouring under the quality of darkness. That man who is<br>homeless, who roves over the world (in his mendicant rounds), who has the<br>foot of a tree for his shelter, who observes the vow of taciturnity,<br>never cooks for himself, and seeks to restrain all the functions of his<br>senses, is, O Partha, a renouncer in the observance of the vow of<br>mendicancy.[24] That Brahmana who, disregarding wrath and joy, and<br>especially deceitfulness, always employs his time in the study of the<br>Vedas, is a renouncer in the observance of the vow of mendicancy.[25] The<br>four different modes of life were at one time weighed in the balance. The<br>wise have said, O king, that when domesticity was placed on one scale, it<br>required the three others to be placed on the other for balancing it.<br>Beholding the result of this examination by scales, O Partha, and seeing<br>further, O Bharata, that domesticity alone contained both heaven and<br>pleasure, that became the way of the great Rishis and the refuge of all<br>persons conversant with the ways of the world. He, therefore, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, who betakes himself to this mode of life, thinking it to<br>be his duty and abandoning all desire for fruit, is a real renouncer, and<br>not that man of clouded understanding who goes to the woods, abandoning<br>home and its surroundings. A person, again, who under the hypocritical<br>garb of righteousness, fails to forget his desires (even while living in<br>the woods), is bound by the grim King of death with his deadly fetters<br>round the neck. Those acts that are done from vanity, are said to be<br>unproductive of fruit. Those acts, on the other hand, O monarch I that<br>are done from a spirit of renunciation, always bear abundant fruits.[26]<br>Tranquillity, self-restraint, fortitude, truth, purity, simplicity,<br>sacrifices, perseverance, and righteousness,&#8212;these are always regarded<br>as virtues recommended by the Rishis. In domesticity, it is said, are<br>acts intended for Pitris, gods, guests. In this mode of life alone, O<br>monarch, are the threefold aims to be attained.[27] The renouncer that<br>rigidly adheres to this mode of life, in which one is free to do all<br>acts, has not to encounter ruin either here or hereafter. The sinless<br>Lord of all creatures, of righteous soul, created creatures, with the<br>intention that they would adore him by sacrifices with profuse presents.<br>Creepers and trees and deciduous herbs, and animals that are clean, and<br>clarified butter, were created as ingredients of sacrifice. For one in<br>the observance of domesticity the performance of sacrifice is fraught<br>with impediments. For this, that mode of life has been said to be<br>exceedingly difficult and unattainable. Those persons, therefore, in the<br>observance of the domestic mode of life, who, possessed of wealth and<br>corn and animals, do not perform sacrifices, earn, O monarch, eternal<br>sin. Amongst Rishis, there are some that regard the study of the Vedas to<br>be a sacrifice: and some that regard contemplation to be a great<br>sacrifice which they perform in their minds. The very gods, O monarch,<br>covet the companionship of a regenerate person like this, who in<br>consequence of his treading along such a way which consists in the<br>concentration of the mind, has become equal to Brahma. By refusing to<br>spend in sacrifice the diverse kinds of wealth that thou hast taken from<br>thy foes, thou art only displaying thy want of faith. I have never seen,<br>O monarch, a king in the observance of a life of domesticity renouncing<br>his wealth in any other way except in the Rajasuya, the Astwamedha, and<br>other kinds of sacrifice. Like Sakra, the chief of the celestial, O sire,<br>perform those other sacrifices that are praised by the Brahmanas. That<br>king, through whose heedlessness the subjects are plunged by robbers, and<br>who does not offer protection to those whom he is called upon to govern,<br>is said to be the very embodiment of Kati. If, without giving away<br>steeds, and kine, and female slaves, and elephants adorned with<br>trappings, and villages, and populous regions, and fields, and houses,<br>unto Brahmanas, we retire into the woods with hearts not harbouring<br>friendly feeling towards kinsmen, even we shall be, O monarch, such Kalis<br>of the kingly order. Those members of the kingly order that do not<br>practise charity and give protection (to others), incur sin. Woe is their<br>portion hereafter and not bliss. If, O lord, without performing great<br>sacrifices and the rites in honour of thy deceased ancestors, and it,<br>without bathing in sacred waters, thou betakest thyself to a wandering<br>life, thou shalt then meet with destruction like a small cloud separated<br>from a mass and dashed by the winds. Thou shalt then fall off from both<br>worlds and have to take thy birth in the Pisacha order.[28] A person<br>becomes a true renouncer by casting off every internal and external<br>attachment, and not simply by abandoning home for dwelling in the woods.<br>A Brahmana that lives in the observance of these ordinances in which<br>there are no impediments, does not fall off from this or the other world.<br>Observant of the duties of one's own order,&#8212;duties respected by the<br>ancients and practised by the best of men, who is there, O Partha, that<br>would grieve, O king, for having in a trice stain in battle his foes that<br>swelled with prosperity, like Sakra slaying the forces of the Daityas?<br>Having in the observance of Kshatriya duties subjugated the world by the<br>aid of thy prowess, and having made presents unto persons conversant with<br>the Vedas, thou canst, O monarch, go to regions higher than heaven. It<br>behoves thee not, O Partha, to indulge in grief."
