                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I know what benevolence is, in consequence of my<br>observation of persons that are good. I do not, however, know them that<br>are malevolent, nor the nature of their acts, O Bharata. Indeed, people<br>avoid malevolent persons of cruel deeds even as they avoid thorns and<br>pitfalls and fire. It is evident, O Bharata, that he who is malevolent is<br>sure to burn (with misery) both here and hereafter. Therefore, O thou of<br>Kuru's race, tell me what, in truth, the acts of such a person are.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Malevolent persons always do wicked acts and feel an<br>irresistible inclination for doing them. They slander others and incur<br>obloquy themselves. They always regard themselves as cheated of what is<br>their due. A malevolent person brags of his own acts of charity. He sees<br>others with malicious eyes. He is very mean. He is deceitful, and full of<br>cunning. He never gives others their dues. He is arrogant. He keeps evil<br>company and is always boastful. He fears and suspects all with whom he<br>comes into contact. He is of foolish understanding. He practises<br>miserliness. He praises his associates. He cherishes an inordinate<br>aversion and hatred for all recluses who have retired into the woods. He<br>takes delight in injuring others. He is utterly regardless of<br>distinguishing the merits and faults of others. He is full of lies. He is<br>discontented. He is exceedingly covetous, and always acts cruelly. Such a<br>person regards a virtuous and accomplished man as a pest, and thinking<br>everybody else to be like himself never trusts any one. Such a person<br>proclaims the faults of other people however unsuspected those faults<br>might viz. With regard to such faults, however, as similar to those that<br>stain his own self, he does not refer to them even remotely, for the sake<br>of the advantage he reaps from them. He regards the person that does him<br>good as a simpleton whom he has cleverly deceived. He is filled with<br>regret for having at any time made any gift of wealth even unto a<br>benefactor. Know him for a malevolent and wicked person who quietly and<br>alone takes comestibles and drinks and other kinds of food that are<br>regarded choice, even when persons are standing by with wishful eyes. He<br>on the other hand, who dedicates the first portion to Brahmanas and takes<br>what remains, dividing it with friends and kinsmen, attains to great<br>felicity in the next world and infinite happiness here. I have now, O<br>chief of the Bharatas, said unto thee what the indications are of the<br>wicked and malevolent man. Such a person should always be avoided by a<br>man of wisdom.'"
