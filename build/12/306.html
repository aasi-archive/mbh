                            '"Janaka said, O holy one, it has been said that the relation between<br>male and female is like that which subsists between the Indestructible<br>and the destructible (or Purusha and Prakriti). Without a male, a female<br>can never conceive. Without a female a male also can never create form.<br>In consequence of their union with each other, and each depending upon<br>the attributes of the other, forms (of living creatures) are seen to<br>flow. This is the case with all orders of being. Through each other's<br>union for purposes of (sexual) congress, and through each depending upon<br>the attributes of the others, forms (of living creatures) flow in<br>menstrual seasons. I shall tell to thee the indications thereof. Hear<br>what the attributes are that belong to the sire and what those are that<br>belong to the mother. Bones, sinews and marrow, O regenerate one, we<br>know, are derived from the sire. Skin, flesh, and blood, we hear are<br>derived from the mother. Even this, O foremost of regenerate persons, is<br>what may be read of in the Vedas and other scriptures. Whatever is read<br>as declared in the Vedas and in other scriptures is regarded as<br>authority. The authority, again, of the Vedas and other scriptures (not<br>inconsistent with the Vedas), is eternal. If Prakriti and Purusha be<br>always united together in this way by each opposing and each depending on<br>the other's attributes, I see, O holy one, that Emancipation cannot<br>exist. Thou, O holy one, art possessed of spiritual vision so that thou<br>seest all things as if they are present before thy eyes. If, therefore,<br>there be any direct evidence of the existence of Emancipation, do thou,<br>speak of it to me. We are desirous of attaining to Emancipation. Indeed,<br>we wish to attain to That which is auspicious, bodiless, not subject to<br>decrepitude, eternal beyond the ken of the senses, and having nothing<br>superior to it.<br><br>'"Vasishtha said, What thou sayest about the indications of the Vedas and<br>the other scriptures (in respect of the matter) is even so. Thou takest<br>those indications in the way in which they should be taken. Thou bearest,<br>however, in thy understanding, only the texts of the Vedas and the other<br>scriptures. Thou art not, O monarch, truly conversant with the real<br>meaning of those texts. That person who bears in his understanding merely<br>the texts of the Vedas and the other scriptures without being conversant<br>with the true sense or meaning of those texts, bears them fruitlessly.<br>Indeed, one who holds the contents of a work in memory without<br>comprehending their meaning is said to bear an useless burden. He,<br>however, who is conversant with the true meaning of a treatise, is said<br>to have studied that treatise to purpose. Questioned regarding the<br>meaning of a text, it behoveth one to communicate that meaning which he<br>has comprehended by a careful study. That person of dull intelligence who<br>refuses to expound the meanings of texts in the midst of a conclave of<br>the learned, that person of foolish understanding, never succeeds in<br>expounding the meaning correctly.[1618] An ignorant person, going to<br>expound the true meaning of treatises, incurs ridicule. Even those<br>possessed of a knowledge of the Soul have to incur ridicule on such<br>occasions (if what they go to explain has not been acquired by study).<br>Listen now to me, O monarch, as to how the subject of Emancipation has<br>been explained (by preceptors to disciple from days of old) among<br>highsouled persons conversant with the Sankhya and the Yoga systems of<br>philosophy. That which the Yogin, behold is precisely that which the<br>Sankhyas arrive after to attain. He who sees the Sankhya and the Yoga<br>systems to be one and the same is said to be endued with intelligence.<br>Skin, flesh, blood, fat, bile, marrow, and sinews, and these senses (of<br>both knowledge and action), about which thou wert speaking unto me,<br>exist. Objects flow from objects; the senses from the senses. From body<br>one obtains a body, as a seed is obtained from seed. When the Supreme<br>Being is without senses, without seed, without matter, without body, He<br>must be divested of all attributes! and in consequence of His being so,<br>how, indeed, can He have attributes of any kind? Space and other<br>attributes arise from the attributes of Sattwa and Rajas and Tamas, and<br>disappear ultimately in them. Thus the attributes arise from Prakriti.<br>Skin, flesh, blood, fat, bile, marrow, bones, and sinews,&#8212;these eight<br>that are made of Prakriti, know, O king, may sometimes be produced by the<br>vital seed alone (of the male). The Jiva-soul and the universe are said<br>to both partake of Prakriti characterised by the three attributes of<br>Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas. The Supreme Soul is different from both the<br>Jiva-soul and the universe. As the seasons though unendued with forms,<br>are nevertheless inferred from the appearance of particular fruits and<br>flowers, after the same manner, Prakriti, though formless, is inferred<br>from the attributes of Mahat and the rest that spring from it. In this<br>way from the existence of Chaitanya in the body, the Supreme Soul,<br>divested of all attributes whatever and perfectly stainless, is inferred.<br>Without beginning and destruction, without end, the overseer of all<br>things, and auspicious, that Soul, only in consequence of its identifying<br>itself with the body and other attributes, comes to be taken as invested<br>with attributes. Those persons that are truly conversant with attributes<br>know that only objects endued with attributes can have attributes but<br>that That which transcends all attributes can have none. When the<br>Jiva-soul conquers all attributes born of Prakriti and which it assumes<br>under error, only then does it behold the Supreme Soul. Only the highest<br>Rishis conversant with the Sankhya and the Yoga systems know that Supreme<br>Soul which Sankhya and Yogins and believers in all other systems say is<br>beyond the Understanding, which is regarded as Knower and endued with the<br>highest wisdom in consequence of its casting off all consciousness of<br>identification with Prakriti, which transcends the attribute of Ignorance<br>or Error, which is Unmanifest, which is beyond all attributes, which is<br>called the Supreme, which is dissociated from all attributes, which<br>ordains all things, which is Eternal and Immutable, which overrules<br>Prakriti and all the attributes born of Prakriti, and which, transcending<br>the four and twenty topics of enquiry, forms the twenty-fifth. When men<br>of knowledge, who stand in fear of birth, of the several conditions of<br>living consciousness, and of death, succeed in knowing the Unmanifest,<br>they succeed in understanding the Supreme Soul at the same time. An<br>intelligent man regards the unity of Jiva-soul with the Supreme Soul as<br>consistent with the scriptures and as perfectly correct, while the man<br>destitute of intelligence looks upon the two as different from each<br>other. This forms the distinction between the man of intelligence and man<br>that is destitute of it. The indications of both Kshara and Akshara<br>(destructible and indestructible) have now been said unto thee. Akshara<br>is Oneness or Unity, while multiplicity or variety is said to be Kshara.<br>When one begins to study and understands properly the five and twenty<br>topics of enquiry, one then comprehends that the Oneness of the Soul is<br>consistent with the scriptures and its multiplicity is what is opposed to<br>them. These are the several indications of what is included in the tale<br>of topics or principles created and what transcends that tale. The wise<br>have said that the tale of topics numbers only five and twenty. That<br>which transcends the topics is beyond that number and forms the<br>twenty-sixth. The study or comprehension of created things (numbered five<br>and twenty) according to their aggregates (of five) is the study and<br>comprehension of topics. Transcending these is That which is eternal.'"
