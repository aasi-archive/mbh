                            "Bhishma said, 'All immobile and mobile beings, distributed into four<br>classes, have been said to be of unmanifest birth and unmanifest death.<br>Existing only in the unmanifest Soul, the Mind is said to possess the<br>attributes of the unmanifest.[719] As a vast tree is ensconced within a<br>small unblown Aswattha flower and becomes observable only when it comes<br>out, even so birth takes place from what is unmanifest. A piece of iron,<br>which is inanimate, runs towards a piece of loadstone. Similarly,<br>inclinations and propensities due to natural instincts, and all else, run<br>towards the Soul in a new life.[720] Indeed, even as those propensities<br>and possessions born of Ignorance and Delusion, and inanimate in respect<br>of their nature, are united with Soul when reborn, after the same manner,<br>those other propensities and aspirations of the Soul that have their gaze<br>directed towards Brahma become united with it, coming to it directly from<br>Brahma itself.[721] Neither earth, nor sky, nor heaven, nor things, nor<br>the vital breaths, nor virtue and vice, nor anything else, existed<br>before, save the Chit-Soul. Nor have they any necessary connection with<br>even the Chit-Soul defiled by Ignorance.[722] The Soul is eternal. It is<br>indestructible. It occurs in every creature. It is the cause of the Mind.<br>It is without attributes, This universe that we perceive hath been<br>declared (in the Vedas) to be due to Ignorance or Delusion. The Soul's<br>apprehensions of form, etc., are due to past desires.[723] The Soul, when<br>it becomes endued with those causes (viz., desire), is led to the state<br>of its being engaged in acts. In consequence of that condition (for those<br>acts again produce desires to end in acts anew and so on),&#8212;this vast<br>wheel to existence revolves, without beginning and without end.[724] The<br>Unmanifest, viz., the Understanding (with the desires), is the nave of<br>that wheel. The Manifest (i.e., the body with the senses) constitutes its<br>assemblage of spokes, the perceptions and acts from its circumference.<br>Propelled by the quality of Rajas (Passion), the Soul presides over it<br>(witnessing its revolutions). Like oilmen pressing oilseeds in their<br>machine, the consequences born of Ignorance, assailing the universe (of<br>creatures) which is moistened by Rajas, press or grind it in that wheel.<br>In that succession of existences, the living creature, seized by the idea<br>of Self in consequence of desire, engages itself in acts. In the union of<br>cause and effect, those acts again become (new causes).[725] Effects do<br>not enter into causes. Nor do causes enter into effects. In the<br>production of effects, Time is the Cause. The primordial essences (eight<br>in number as mentioned before), and their modifications six-(teen in<br>number), fraught with causes, exists in a state of union, in consequence<br>of their being always presided over by the Soul. Like dust following the<br>wind that moves it, the creature-Soul, divested of body, but endued still<br>with inclinations born of Passion and Darkness and with principles of<br>causes constituted by the acts of the life that is over, moves on,<br>following the direction that the Supreme Soul gives it. The Soul,<br>however, is never touched by those inclinations and propensities. Nor are<br>these touched by the Soul that is superior to them. The wind, which is<br>naturally pure, is never stained by the dust it bears away.[726] As the<br>wind is truly separate from the dust it bears away, even so, the man of<br>wisdom should know, is the connection between that which is called<br>existence or life and the Soul. No one should take it that the Soul, in<br>consequence of its apparent union with the body and the senses and the<br>other propensities and beliefs and unbeliefs, is really endued therewith<br>as its necessary and absolute qualities. On the other hand, the Soul<br>should be taken as existing in its own nature. Thus did the divine Rishi<br>solve the doubt that had taken possession of his disciple's mind.<br>Notwithstanding all this, people depend upon means consisting of acts and<br>scriptural rites for casting off misery and winning happiness. Seeds that<br>are scorched by fire do not put forth sprouts. After the same manner, if<br>everything that contributes to misery be consumed by the fire of true<br>knowledge, the Soul escapes the obligation of rebirth in the world.'
