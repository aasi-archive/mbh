                            "Yudhishthira said, 'What are the fruits of the yoga represented by<br>Knowledge, of all the Vedas, and of the (various) observances and vows?<br>How also may the creature-soul be known? Tell us, this, O grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative of the<br>discourse between that lord of creatures, viz., Manu, and the great<br>Rishi, Vrihaspati. In days of old, the foremost of celestial Rishis,<br>viz., Vrihaspati, who was a disciple of Manu, bowed to his preceptor and<br>addressing that lord and first of all creatures, said, 'What is the cause<br>(of the universe)? Whence have the ordinances (about sacrifices and other<br>pious observances) flowed? What are those fruits which the learned say<br>are attached to Knowledge? Tell me also truly, O illustrious one, what is<br>that which the very, Vedas have not been able to reveal? What are those<br>fruits which are adored by eminent personages conversant with the science<br>of Artha, with the Vedas, and with the Mantras, through sacrifices and<br>plentiful gifts of kine? Whence do those fruits arise? Where are they to<br>be found? Tell me also this old history, viz., whence have the earth, all<br>earthly objects, wind, sky, aquatic creatures, water, heaven, and the<br>denizens of heaven, all sprung? Man's inclinations tend towards that<br>object about which he seeks knowledge. I have no knowledge of that<br>Ancient and Supreme one. How shall I rescue myself from a false display<br>of inclinations towards Him?[650] The Riks, all the Samanas, all the<br>Yajuses, the Chhandas, Astronomy, Nirukta, Grammar, Sankalpa, and Siksha,<br>I have studied. But I pave no knowledge of the nature of the great<br>creatures (the five primal elements) that enter into the composition of<br>everything.[651] Tell me all I have asked thee, by using only simple<br>assertions and distinguishing adjectives or attributes. Tell me what the<br>fruits are of Knowledge and what those fruits that are attached to<br>sacrifices and other religious rites. Explain to me how also an embodied<br>being departs from his body and how he attains to another body.'<br><br>"Manu said, 'That which is agreeable to one is said to constitute one's<br>happiness. Similarly, that which is disagreeable to one is said to<br>constitute one's misery.&#8212;By this I shall obtain happiness and keep off<br>misery&#8212;from a sentiment like this flow all religious acts. The efforts<br>for the acquisition of Knowledge, however, arise from a sentiment for<br>avoiding both happiness and misery.[652] The ordinances about sacrifices<br>and other observances, that occur in the Vedas, are all connected with<br>desire. He, however, who liberates himself from desire, succeeds in<br>attaining to Brahma. That man who, from desire of winning happiness,<br>walks in the path of acts which are of diverse kinds, has to go to<br>hell.'[653]<br><br>"Vrihaspati said, 'Men's aspirations are concerned with the acquisition<br>of the agreeable which ends in happiness, and the avoidance of the<br>disagreeable which brings misery. Such acquisition and such avoidance<br>again are accomplished by acts.'[654]<br><br>"Manu said, 'It is by liberating oneself from acts that one succeeds in<br>entering into Brahma. The ordinances about acts have flowed for that very<br>end.[655] The ordinances about acts tempts only those whose hearts are<br>not free from desire. By liberating oneself from acts (as already said)<br>one acquires the highest state. One desirous of felicity (Emancipation),<br>betaking oneself to religious rites, becomes purified (from attachments)<br>by acts having for their object the purification of the soul, and at last<br>wins great splendour. By liberating oneself from acts, one acquires the<br>highest end, viz., Brahma, which is very much above the reward that acts<br>give. Creatures have all been created by Mind and Act. These again are<br>the two best paths adored by all. Outward acts produce fruits that are<br>transitory as also eternal. For acquiring the latter there is no other<br>means than abandonment of fruits by the mind.[656] As the eye, when night<br>passes away and the veil of darkness is removed from it, leads its<br>possessor by its own power, so the Understanding, when it becomes endued<br>with Knowledge, succeeds in beholding all evils that are worthy of<br>avoidance.[657] Snakes, sharp-pointed kusa blades, and pits, men avoid<br>when they perceive them lie on their way. If some tread upon or fall into<br>them, they do so through ignorance. Behold the superiority of the fruits<br>of knowledge (over those of ignorance). Mantras applied duly, sacrifices,<br>the presents called Dakshina, gift of food, and concentration of the mind<br>(for divine contemplation),&#8212;these are the five acts that are said to be<br>productive of fruits, there being none else. Acts have (the three)<br>attributes (of Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas) for their soul. The Vedas say<br>this. (The Vedas consist of Mantras). The Mantras, therefore, have the<br>same three attributes, since it is with Mantras that acts are to be<br>accomplished. The ritual also must be liable to the same three<br>attributes. The fruits of action depend upon the mind. It is the embodied<br>creature that enjoys those fruits.[658] All excellent kinds of sound,<br>form, taste, touch, and scent, are the fruits of acts, being attainable<br>in the region of acts (i.e., heaven). As regards, however, the fruits of<br>knowledge, man acquires them even here before death.[659] Whatever acts<br>are accomplished by means of the body, one enjoys the fruits thereof in a<br>state of physical existence. The body is, indeed, the framework to which<br>happiness inheres, as also the framework to which misery inheres.[660]<br>Whatever acts are accomplished by means of words, their fruits are to be<br>enjoyed in a state in which words can be spoken. Similarly, whatever acts<br>are accomplished by the mind, their fruits are enjoyed in a state in<br>which one is not freed from the mind.[661] Devoted to the fruits of acts,<br>whatever kind of acts (Sattwika or Rajasika or Tamasika) a person<br>covetous of fruits accomplishes, the fruits, good or bad, that he<br>actually enjoys partake of their character. Like fishes going against a<br>current of water, the acts of a past life come to the actor. The embodied<br>creature experiences happiness for his good acts, and misery for his evil<br>ones. Him from whom this universe hath sprung. Him by knowing whom<br>persons of cleansed souls transgress this world, Him who has not been<br>expressed by Vedic mantras and words. I will now indicate. Listen to me<br>as I speak of that highest of the high. Himself liberated from the<br>several kinds of taste and scent, and sound and touch and form. He is<br>incapable of being grasped by the senses, unmanifest, without colour, the<br>One, and He has created the five kinds of objects[662] for His creatures.<br>He is neither female, nor male, nor of the neuter sex. He is neither<br>existent, nor non-existent, nor existent-nonexistent.[663] Only those<br>that are acquainted with Brahma behold Him. He knoweth no direction."'
