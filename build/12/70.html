                            "Yudhishthira said, 'By adopting that conduct, O thou that art conversant<br>with every kind of behaviour, can a king succeed in easily acquiring,<br>both here and hereafter, objects productive of happiness in the end?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'There are these thirty-six virtues (which a king should<br>observe). They are connected with thirty-six others. A virtuous person,<br>by attending to those qualities, can certainly acquire great merit. The<br>king should observe his duties without wrath and malice. He should not<br>abandon kindness. He should have faith. He should acquire wealth without<br>persecution and cruelty. He should pursue pleasure without attachments.<br>He should, with cheerfulness, utter what is the agreeable, and be brave<br>without brag. He should be liberal but should not make gifts to persons<br>that are unobserving. He should have prowess without cruelty. He should<br>make alliance, avoiding those that are wicked. He should not act with<br>hostility towards friends. He should never employ persons not devoted to<br>him as his spies and secret agents. He should never accomplish his<br>objects by persecution. He should never, disclose his purposes before<br>persons that are wicked. He should speak of the merits of others but<br>never his own. He should take wealth from his subjects but never from<br>those that are good. He should never employ or take the assistance of<br>persons that are wicked. He should never inflict punishment without<br>careful enquiry. He should never disclose his counsels. He should give<br>away, but not to persons that are covetous. He should repose confidence<br>on others but never on those that have injured him. He should not cherish<br>malice. He should protect his wedded wives. He should be pure and should<br>not always be melted by compassion. He should not indulge much in female<br>companionship. He should take food that is wholesome and never that which<br>is otherwise. He should without pride pay regards to those that deserve<br>them, and serve his preceptors and seniors with sincerity. He should<br>worship the gods without pride. He should seek prosperity, but never do<br>anything that brings infamy. He should wait (upon his seniors) with<br>humility. He should be clever in business but should always wait for the<br>proper time. He should comfort men and never send them away with empty<br>speeches. Having favoured a person, he should not abandon him. He should<br>never strike in ignorance. Having slain his foe he should never indulge<br>in sorrow. He should display temper, but should never do so when there is<br>no occasion. He should be mild, but never to those that have offended.<br>Conduct thyself thus while ruling thy kingdom if thou wishest to have<br>prosperity. The king that behaves otherwise incurs great danger. That<br>king who observes all these virtues that I have mentioned, reaps many<br>blessings on earth and great rewards in heaven.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of Santanu's son, king<br>Yudhishthira, docile in receiving instructions, possessed of great<br>intelligence, and protected by Bhima and others, then worshipped his<br>grandsire and from that time began to rule according to that teaching.'"
