                            "Bhishma said, 'Janadeva of the race of Janaka, thus instructed by the<br>great Rishi Panchasikha, once more asked him about the topic of existence<br>or nonexistence after death.'<br><br>"Janadeva said, 'O illustrious one, if no person retains any knowledge<br>after departing from this state of being, if, indeed, this is true, where<br>then is the difference between Ignorance and Knowledge? What do we gain<br>then by knowledge and what do we lose by ignorance? Behold, O foremost of<br>regenerate persons, that if Emancipation be: such, then all religious<br>acts and vows end only in annihilation. Of what avail would then the<br>distinction be between heedfulness and heedlessness? If Emancipation<br>means dissociation from all objects of pleasurable enjoyment or an<br>association with objects that are not lasting, for what then would men<br>cherish a desire for action, or, having set themselves to action,<br>continue to devise the necessary means for the accomplishment of desired<br>ends? What then is the truth (in connection with this topic)?'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Beholding the king enveloped in thick darkness,<br>stupefied by error, and become helpless, the learned Panchasikha<br>tranquillised him by once more addressing him in the following words, 'In<br>this (Emancipation) the consummation is not Extinction. Nor is that<br>consummation any kind of Existence (that one can readily conceive). This<br>that we see is a union of body, senses, and mind. Existing independently<br>as also controlling one another, these go on acting. The materials that<br>constitute the body are water, space, wind, heat, and earth. These exist<br>together (forming the body) according to their own nature. They disunite<br>again according to their own nature. Space and wind and heat and water<br>and earth,&#8212;these five objects in a state of union constitute the body.<br>The body is not one element. Intelligence, stomachic heat, and the vital<br>breaths, called Prana, etc., that are all wind,&#8212;these three are said to<br>be organs of action. The senses, the objects of the senses (viz., sound,<br>form, etc.), the power (dwelling in those objects) in consequence of<br>which they become capable of being perceived, the faculties (dwelling in<br>the senses) in consequence of which they succeed in perceiving them, the<br>mind, the vital breaths called Prana, Apana and the rest, and the various<br>juices and humours that are the results of the digestive organs, flow<br>from the three organs already named.[814] Hearing, touch, taste, vision,<br>and scent,&#8212;these are the five senses. They have derived their attributes<br>from the mind which, indeed, is their cause. The mind, existing as an<br>attribute of Chit has three states, viz., pleasure, pain, and absence of<br>both pleasure and pain. Sound, touch, form, taste, scent, and the objects<br>to which they inhere,&#8212;these till the moment of one's death are causes<br>for the production of one's knowledge. Upon the senses rest all acts<br>(that lead to heaven), as also renunciation (leading to the attainment of<br>Brahma), and also the ascertainment of truth in respect of all topics of<br>enquiry. The learned say that ascertainment (of truth) is the highest<br>object of existence, and that it is the seed or root of Emancipation; and<br>with respect to Intelligence, they say that leads to Emancipation and<br>Brahma.[815] That person who regards this union of perishable attributes<br>(called the body and the objects of the senses) as the Soul, feels, in<br>consequence of such imperfection of knowledge, much misery that proves<br>again to be unending. Those persons, on the other hand, who regard all<br>worldly objects as not-Soul, and who on that account cease to have any<br>affection or attachment for them, have never to suffer any sorrow for<br>sorrow, in their case stands in need of some foundation upon which to<br>rest. In this connection there exists the unrivalled branch of knowledge<br>which treats of Renunciation. It is called Samyagradha. I shall discourse<br>to thee upon it. Listen to it for the sake of thy Emancipation.<br>Renunciation of acts is (laid down) for all persons who strive earnestly<br>for Emancipation. They, however, who have not been taught correctly (and<br>who on that account think that tranquillity may be attained without<br>renunciation) have to bear a heavy burthen of sorrow. Vedic sacrifices<br>and other rites exist for renunciation of wealth and other possessions.<br>For renunciation of all enjoyments exist vows and fasts of diverse kinds.<br>For renunciation of pleasure and happiness, exist penances and yoga.<br>Renunciation, however, of everything, is the highest kind of<br>renunciation. This that I shall presently tell thee is the one path<br>pointed out by the learned for that renunciation of everything. They that<br>betake themselves to that path succeed in driving off all sorrow. They,<br>however, that deviate from it reap distress and misery.[816] First<br>speaking of the five organs of knowledge having the mind for the sixth,<br>and all of which dwell in the understanding, I shall tell thee of the<br>five organs of action having strength for their sixth. The two hands<br>constitute two organs ok action. The two legs are the two organs for<br>moving from one place to another. The sexual organ exists for both<br>pleasure and the continuation of the species. The lower duct, leading<br>from the stomach downwards, is the organ for expulsion of all used-up<br>matter. The organs of utterance exist for the expression of sounds. Know<br>that these five organs of action appertain or belong to the mind. These<br>are the eleven organs of knowledge and of action (counting the mind). One<br>should quickly cast off the mind with the understanding.[817] In the act<br>of hearing, three causes must exist together, viz., two ears, sound, and<br>the mind. The same is the case with the perception of touch; the same<br>with that of form; the same with that of taste and smell.[818] These<br>fifteen accidents or attributes are needed for the several kinds of<br>perception indicated. Every man, in consequence of them, becomes<br>conscious of three separate things in respect of those perceptions (viz.,<br>a material organ, its particular function, and the mind upon which that<br>function acts). There are again (in respect of all perceptions of the<br>mind) three classes, viz., those that appertain to Goodness, those that<br>appertain to Passion, and those that appertain to Darkness. Into them<br>run, three kinds of consciousness, including all feelings and emotions.<br>Raptures, satisfaction, joy, happiness, and tranquillity, arising in the<br>mind from any Perceptible cause or in the absence of any apparent cause,<br>belong to the attribute of Goodness. Discontent, regret, grief, cupidity,<br>and vindictiveness, causeless or occasioned by any perceptible cause, are<br>the indications of the attribute known as Passion. Wrong judgment,<br>stupefaction, heedlessness, dreams, and sleepiness, however caused,<br>belong to the attribute of Darkness. Whatever state of consciousness<br>exists, with respect to either the body or the mind, united with joy or<br>satisfaction, should be regarded as due to the quality of Goodness.<br>Whatever state of consciousness exists united with any feeling of<br>discontent or cheerlessness should be regarded as occasioned by an<br>accession of the attribute of Passion into the mind. Whatever state, as<br>regards either the body or the mind, exists with error or heedlessness,<br>should be known as indicative of Darkness which is incomprehensible and<br>inexplicable. The organ of hearing rests on space; it is space itself<br>(under limitations); (Sound has that organ for its refuge). (Sound,<br>therefore, is a modification of space). In perceiving sound, one may not<br>immediately acquire a knowledge of the organ of hearing and of space. But<br>when sound is perceived, the organ of hearing and space do not long<br>remain unknown. (By destroying the ear, sound and space, may be<br>destroyed; and, lastly, by destroying the mind all may be destroyed). The<br>same is the case with the skin, the eyes, the tongue, and the nose<br>constituting the fifth. They exist in touch, form, taste, and smell. They<br>constitute the faculty of perception and they are the mind.[819] Each<br>employed in its own particular function, all the five organs of action<br>and five others of knowledge exist together, and upon the union, of the<br>ten dwells the mind as the eleventh and upon the mind the understanding<br>as the twelfth. If it be said that these twelve do not exist together,<br>then the consequence that would result would be death in dreamless<br>slumber. But as there is no death in dreamless slumber, it must be<br>conceded that these twelve exist together as regards themselves but<br>separately from the Soul. The co-existence of those twelve with the Soul<br>that is referred to in common speech is only a common form of speech with<br>the vulgar for ordinary purposes of the world. The dreamer, in<br>consequence of the appearance of past sensual impressions, becomes<br>conscious of his senses in their subtile forms, and endued as he already<br>is with the three attributes (of goodness, passion, and darkness), he<br>regards his senses as existing with their respective objects and,<br>therefore, acts and moves about with an imaginary body after the manner<br>of his own self while awake.[820] That dissociation of the Soul from the<br>understanding and i the mind with the senses, which quickly disappears,<br>which has no stability, and which the mind causes to arise only when<br>influenced by darkness, is felicity that partakes, as the learned say, of<br>the nature of darkness and is experienced in this gross body only. (The<br>felicity of Emancipation certainly differs from it).[821] Over the<br>felicity of Emancipation also, the felicity, viz., which is awakened by<br>the inspired teaching of the Vedas and in which no one sees the slightest<br>tincture of sorrow,&#8212;the same indescribable and truth concealing darkness<br>seems to spread itself (but in reality the felicity of Emancipation is<br>unstained by darkness).[822] Like again to what occurs in dreamless<br>slumber, in Emancipation also, subjective and objective existences (from<br>Consciousness to objects of the senses, all included), which have their<br>origin in one's acts, are all discarded. In some, that are overwhelmed by<br>Avidya, these exist, firmly grafted with them. Unto others who have<br>transcended Avidya and have won knowledge, they never come at any<br>time.[823] They that are conversant with speculations about the character<br>of Soul and not-Soul, say that this sum total (of the senses, etc.) is<br>body (kshetra). That existent thing which rests upon the mind is called<br>Soul (kshetrajna). When such is the case, and when all creatures, in<br>consequence of the well-known cause (which consists of ignorance, desire,<br>and acts whose beginning cannot be conceived), exist, due also to their<br>primary nature (which is a state of union between Soul and body), (of<br>these two) which then is destructible, and how can that (viz., the Soul),<br>which is said to be eternal, suffer destruction?[824] As small rivers<br>falling into larger ones lose their forms and names, and the larger ones<br>(thus enlarged) rolling into the ocean, lose their forms and names too,<br>after the same manner occurs that form of extinction of life called<br>Emancipation.[825] This being the case, when jiva which is characterised<br>by attributes, is received into the Universal Soul, and when all its<br>attributes disappear, how can it be the object of mention by<br>differentiation? One who is conversant with that understanding which is<br>directed towards the accomplishment of Emancipation and who heedfully<br>seeks to know the Soul, is never soiled by the evil fruits of his acts<br>even as a lotus leaf though dipped in water is never soaked by it. When<br>one becomes freed from the very strong bonds, many in number, occasioned<br>by affection for children and spouses and love for sacrifices and other<br>rites, when one casts off both joy and sorrow and transcends all<br>attachments, one then attains to the highest end and entering into the<br>Universal Soul becomes incapable of differentiation. When one has<br>understood the declarations of the Srutis that lead to correct inferences<br>(about Brahma) and has practised those auspicious virtues which the same<br>and other scriptures inculcate, one may lie down at ease, setting at<br>nought the fears of decrepitude and death. When both merits and sins<br>disappear, and the fruits, in the form of joy and sorrow, arising<br>therefrom, are destroyed, men, unattached to everything, take refuge at<br>first on Brahma invested with personality, and then behold impersonal<br>Brahma in their understandings.[826] Jiva in course of its downward<br>descent under the influence of Avidya lives here (within its cell formed<br>by acts) after the manner of a silk-worm residing within its cell made of<br>threads woven by itself. Like the freed silk-worm again that abandons its<br>cell, jiva also abandons its house generated by its acts. The final<br>result that takes place is that its sorrows are then destroyed like a<br>clump of earth falling with violence upon a rocky mass.[827] As the Ruru<br>casting off its old horns or the snake casting off its slough goes on<br>without attracting any notice, after the same manner a person that is<br>unattached casts off all his sorrows. As a bird deserts a tree that is<br>about to fall down upon a piece of water and thus severing itself from it<br>alights on a (new) resting place, after the same manner the person freed<br>from attachments casts off both joy and sorrow and dissociated even from<br>his subtile and subtiler forms attains to that end which is fraught with<br>the highest prosperity.[828] Their own ancestor Janaka, the chief of<br>Mithila, beholding his city burning in a conflagration, himself<br>proclaimed, 'In this conflagration nothing of mine is burning.' King<br>Janadeva, having listened to these words capable of yielding immortality<br>and uttered by Panchasikha, and arriving at the truth after carefully<br>reflecting upon everything that the latter had said, cast off his sorrows<br>and lived on in the enjoyment of great felicity. He who reads this<br>discourse, O king, that treat of emancipation and who always reflects<br>upon it, is never pained by any calamity, and freed from sorrow, attains<br>to emancipation like Janadeva, the ruler of Mithila after his meeting<br>with Panchasikha.'"
