The Sun and the Moon are thy two<br>eyes, and the Grandsire is thy heart. Thou art the Ocean. The goddess<br>Saraswati is thy speech and Fire and Wind are thy might. Thou art Day and<br>Night. Thou art all acts including the opening and the shutting of the<br>eye. Neither Brahman, nor Govinda, nor the ancient Rishis, are competent<br>to understand thy greatness, O auspicious deity, truly. Those subtile<br>forms which thou hast are invisible to us. Rescue me and, O, protect me<br>as the sire protects the son of his loins. O, protect one! I deserve thy<br>protection. I bow to thee, O sinless one! Thou, O illustrious one, art<br>full of compassion for thy devotees. I am always devoted to thee. Let him<br>be always my protector who stayeth alone on the other side of the ocean,<br>in a form that is difficult to be apprehended, and overwhelming many<br>thousands of persons![1434] I bow to that Soul of Yoga who is beheld in<br>the form of an effulgent Light by persons that have their senses under<br>control, that are possessed of the attribute of Sattwa, that have<br>regulated their breaths, and that have conquered sleep.[1435] I bow to<br>him who is endued with matted locks, who bears the ascetic's staff in his<br>hand, who is possessed of a body having a long abdomen, who has a<br>kamandalu tied to his back, and who is the Soul of Brahman. I bow to Him<br>who is the soul of water, in whose hair are the clouds, in the joints of<br>whose body are the rivers, and in whose stomach are the four oceans. I<br>seek the protection to Him who, when the end of the Yuga comes, devours<br>all creatures and stretches himself (for sleep) on the wide expanse of<br>water that covers the universe. Let him who entering Rahu's mouth<br>drinketh Soma in the night and who becoming Swarbhanu devoureth Surya<br>also, protect me![1436] The deities, who are mere infants and who have<br>all sprung from thee after Brahman's creation, enjoy their respective<br>shares (in sacrificial offerings). Let them (peacefully) enjoy those<br>offerings made with Swaha and Swadha, and let them derive pleasure from<br>those presents. I bow to them.[1437] Let those Beings that are of the<br>stature of the thumb and that dwell in all bodies, always protect and<br>gratify me.[1438] I always bow to those Beings who dwelling within<br>embodied creatures make the latter cry in grief without themselves crying<br>in grief, and who gladden them without themselves being glad. I always<br>bow to those Rudras who dwell in rivers, in oceans, in hills and<br>mountains, in mountain-caves, in the roots of trees, in cow-pens, in<br>inaccessible forests, in the intersections of roads, in roads, in open<br>squares, in banks (of rivers and lakes and oceans), in elephant-sheds, in<br>stables, in car-sheds, in deserted gardens and houses, in the five primal<br>elements, and in the cardinal and subsidiary directions. I bow repeatedly<br>unto them that dwell in the space amidst the Sun and the Moon, as also in<br>rays of the Sun and the Moon, and them that dwell in the nether regions,<br>and them that have betaken themselves to Renunciation and other superior<br>practices for the sake of the Supreme.[1439] I bow always unto them that<br>are unnumbered, that are unmeasured, and that have no form, unto those<br>Rudras, that is, that are endued with infinite attributes. Since thou, O<br>Rudra, art the Creator of all creatures, since, O Hara, thou art the<br>Master of all creatures, and since thou art the indwelling Soul of all<br>creatures, therefore wert thou not invited by me (to my Sacrifices).<br>Since thou art He who is adored in all sacrifices with plentiful gifts,<br>and since it is Thou that art the Creator of all things, therefore I did<br>not invite thee. Or, perhaps, O god, stupefied by thy subtile illusion I<br>failed to invite thee. Be gratified with me, blessed by thyself, O Bhava,<br>with me possessed by the quality of Rajas. My Mind, my Understanding, and<br>my Chitta all dwell in thee, O god!<br><br>"Hearing these adorations, that Lord of all creatures, viz., Mahadeva,<br>ceased (to think of inflicting further injuries on Daksha). Indeed,<br>highly gratified, the illustrious deity addressed Daksha, saying, 'O<br>Daksha of excellent vows, pleased have I been with these adorations of<br>thine. Thou needst not praise me more. Thou shalt attain to my<br>companionship. Through my grace, O progenitor of creatures, thou shalt<br>earn the fruit of a thousand horse-sacrifices, and a hundred Vajapeyas<br>(in consequence of this one incomplete sacrifice of thine).<br><br>"Once more, Mahadeva, that thorough master of words, addressed Daksha and<br>said unto him these words fraught with high consolation, 'Be thou the<br>foremost of all creatures in the world. Thou shouldst not, O Daksha,<br>entertain any feelings of grief for these injuries inflicted on thy<br>Sacrifice. It has been seen that in former Kalpas too I had to destroy<br>thy Sacrifice.[1440] O thou of excellent vows, I shall grant thee again<br>some more boons. Take them from me. Dispelling this cheerlessness that<br>overspreads thy face, listen to me with undivided attention. With the aid<br>of arguments addressed to reason the deities and the Danavas have<br>extracted from the Vedas consisting of six branches and from the system<br>of Sankhya and Yoga a creed in consequence of which they have practised<br>the austerest penances for many long years. The religion, however, which<br>I have extracted, is unparalleled, and productive of benefits on every<br>side. It is open to men in all modes of life to practise it. It leads to<br>Emancipation. It may be acquired in many years or through merit by<br>persons who have restrained their senses. It is shrouded in mystery. They<br>that are divested of wisdom regard it as censurable. It is opposed to the<br>duties laid down in respect of the four orders of men and the four modes<br>of life, and agrees with those duties in only a few particulars. They<br>that are well-skilled in the science of (drawing) conclusions (from<br>premises) can understand its propriety: and they who have transcended all<br>the modes of life are worthy of adopting it. In days of yore, O Daksha,<br>this auspicious religion called Pasupata had been extracted by me. The<br>proper observance of that religion produces immense benefits. Let those<br>benefits be thine, O highly blessed one! Cast off this fever of thy<br>heart.' Having said these words, Mahadeva, with his spouse (Uma) and with<br>all his attendants disappeared from the view of Daksha of immeasurable<br>prowess. He who would recite this hymn that was first uttered by Daksha<br>or who would listen to it when recited by another, would never meet with<br>the smallest evil and would attain to a long life. Indeed, as Siva is the<br>foremost of all the deities, even so is this hymn, agreeable with the<br>Srutis, is the foremost of all hymns. Persons desirous of fame, kingdom,<br>happiness, pleasure, profit, and wealth, as also those desirous of<br>learning, should listen with feelings of devotion to the recital of this<br>hymn. One suffering from disease, one distressed by pain, one plunged<br>into melancholy, one afflicted by thieves or by fear, one under the<br>displeasure of the king in respect of his charge, becomes freed from fear<br>(by listening or reciting this hymn). By listening to or reciting this<br>hymn, one, in even this earthly body of his, attains to equality with the<br>spirits forming the attendants of Mahadeva. One becomes endued with<br>energy and fame, and cleansed of all sin (through the virtue of this<br>hymn). Neither Rakshasas, nor Pisachas, nor ghosts, nor Vinayakas, create<br>disturbances in his house where this hymn is recited. That woman, again,<br>who listens to this hymn with pious faith, observing the while the<br>practices of Brahmacharya, wins worship as a goddess in the family of her<br>sire and that of her husband.[1441] All the acts of that person become<br>always crowned with success who listens or recites with rapt attention to<br>the whole of this hymn. In consequence of the recitation of this hymn all<br>the wishes one forms in one's mind and all the wishes one clothes in<br>words become crowned with fruition. That man obtains all objects of<br>enjoyment and pleasure and all things that are wished for by him, who,<br>practising self-restraint, makes according to due rites offerings unto<br>Mahadeva, Guha, Uma, and Nandi, and after that utters their names without<br>delay, in proper order and with devotion. Such a man, departing from this<br>life, ascends to heaven, and has never to take birth among the<br>intermediate animals or birds. This was said even by the puissant Vyasa,<br>the son of Parasara.'"
