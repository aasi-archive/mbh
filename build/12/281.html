                            "Yudhishthira said, 'How great was the love of virtue possessed by Vritra<br>of immeasurable energy, whose knowledge was incomparable and whose<br>devotion to Vishnu was so great. The status occupied by Vishnu of<br>immeasurable energy is exceedingly difficult of apprehension. How, O<br>tiger among kings, could Vritra (who was an Asura) comprehended it (so<br>well)? Thou hast spoken of Vritra's acts. I too have listened to thee in<br>full faith. In consequence, however, of my seeing that one point (in thy<br>discourse) is unintelligible (and that, therefore, it requires<br>explanation), my curiosity has been roused for questioning thee<br>again.[1387] How, indeed, was Vritra, who was virtuous, devoted to<br>Vishnu, endued with knowledge of truth derivable from a just<br>comprehension of the Upanishads and Vedanta, vanquished by Indra, O<br>foremost of men? O chief of the Bharatas, resolve me this doubt. Indeed,<br>tell me, O tiger among kings, how Vritra was vanquished by Sakra![1388] O<br>grandsire, O thou of mighty arms, tell me in detail how the battle took<br>place (between the chief of the deities and the foremost of Asuras). My<br>curiosity to hear it is very great.'<br><br>Bhishma said, 'In days of yore, Indra, accompanied by the celestial<br>forces, proceeded on his car, and beheld the Asura Vritra stationed<br>before him like a mountain. He was full five hundred Yojanas in height, O<br>chastiser of foes, and three hundred Yojanas in circumference. Beholding<br>that form of Vritra, which was incapable of being vanquished by the three<br>worlds united together, the celestial became penetrated with fear and<br>full of anxiety. Indeed, suddenly seeing that gigantic form of his<br>antagonist, O king, Indra was struck with palsy in the lower extremities.<br>Then, on the eve of that great battle between the deities and the Asuras,<br>there arose loud shouts from both sides, and drums and other musical<br>instruments began to beat and blow. Beholding Sakra stationed before him,<br>O thou of Kuru's race, Vritra felt neither awe nor fear, nor was he<br>disposed to muster all his energies for the fight.[1389] Then the<br>encounter commenced, inspiring the three worlds with terror, between<br>Indra, the chief of the deities, and Vritra of high soul. The entire<br>welkin was enveloped by the combats of both sides with swords and axes<br>and lances and darts and spears and heavy clubs and rocks of diverse<br>sizes and bows of loud twang and diverse kinds of celestial weapons and<br>fires and burning brands. All the celestials with Grandsire at their<br>head, and all the highly-blessed Rishis, came to witness the battle, on<br>their foremost of cars; and the Siddhas also, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>and the Gandharvas, with the Apsaras, on their own beautiful and foremost<br>of cars, came there (for the same purpose). Then Vritra, that foremost of<br>virtuous persons, quickly overwhelmed the welkin and the chief of the<br>deities with a thick shower of rocks. The celestials, at this, filled<br>with rage, dispelled with their showers of arrows that thick downpour of<br>rocks showered by Vritra in battle. Then Vritra, O tiger among the Kurus,<br>possessed of mighty strength and endued with large powers of illusion,<br>stupefied the chief of the deities by fighting wholly with the aid of his<br>powers of illusion. When he of a hundred sacrifices, thus afflicted by<br>Vritra. was overcome by stupefaction, the sage Vasishtha restored him to<br>his senses by uttering Somanas.'[1390]<br><br>"Vasishtha said, 'Thou art the foremost of the gods, O chief of the<br>deities, O slayer of Daityas and Asuras! The strength of the three worlds<br>is in thee! Why, then, O Sakra, dost thou languish so! There, Brahman,<br>and Vishnu, and Siva, that lord of the universe, the illustrious and<br>divine Soma, and all the highest Rishis (stand, beholding thee)! Do not,<br>O Sakra, yield to weakness, like an ordinary person! Firmly resolved on<br>battle, slay thy foes, O chief of the celestials! There, that Master of<br>all the worlds, viz., the Three-eyed (Siva), the adored of all the<br>worlds, is eyeing thee! Cast off this stupefaction, O chief of the<br>celestials! There, those regenerate Rishis, headed by Vrihaspati, are<br>praising thee, for thy victory, in celestial hymns.'[1391]<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'While Vasava of great energy was thus being restored<br>to consciousness by the high-souled Vasishtha, his strength became<br>greatly enhanced. The illustrious chastiser of Paka then, relying upon<br>his intelligence, had recourse to high Yoga and with its aid dispelled<br>these illusions of Vritra. Then Vrihaspati, the son of Angiras, and those<br>foremost of Rishis possessed of great prosperity, beholding the prowess<br>of Vritra, repaired to Mahadeva, and impelled by the desire of benefiting<br>the three worlds, urged him to destroy the great Asura. The energy of<br>that illustrious lord of the universe thereupon assumed the character of<br>a fierce fever and penetrated the body of Vritra the lord of<br>Asuras.[1392] The illustrious and divine Vishnu, adored of all the<br>worlds, bent upon protecting the universe, entered the thunderbolt of<br>Indra. Then Vrihaspati of great intelligence and Vasishtha of exceeding<br>energy, and all the other foremost of Rishis, repairing to Him of a<br>hundred sacrifices, viz., the boon-giving Vasava, the adored of all the<br>worlds, addressed him, saying, 'Slay Vritra, O puissant one, without<br>delay!'<br><br>"Maheswara said, 'Yonder, O Sakra, stands the great Vritra, accompanied<br>by a great force. He is the soul of the universe, capable of going<br>everywhere, endued with large powers of illusion, and possessed of great<br>celebrity. This foremost of Asuras is, therefore, incapable of being<br>vanquished by even the three worlds united together. Aided by Yoga, do<br>thou slay him, O chief of the deities. Do not disregard him. For full<br>sixty thousand years, O chief of the celestials, Vritra practised the<br>severest penances for obtaining strength. Brahman gave him the boons he<br>had solicited, viz., the greatness that belongs to Yogins, large powers<br>of illusion, excess of might, and superabundant energy. I impart to thee<br>my energy, O Vasava! The Danava has now lost his coolness. Do thou,<br>therefore, slay him now with thy thunderbolt!'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'Before thy eyes, O foremost of gods, I shall, through thy<br>grace, slay with my thunderbolt this invincible son of Diti.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'When the great Asura or Daitya was overtaken by that<br>fever (born of Mahadeva's energy), the deities and the Rishis, filled<br>with joy, uttered loud cheers, At the same time drums, and conchs of loud<br>blare, and kettle drums and tabors began to beat and blow by thousands.<br>Suddenly all the Asuras became afflicted with the loss of memory. In a<br>trice, their powers of illusion also disappeared. The Rishis and the<br>deities, ascertaining the foe to be thus possessed, uttered the praises<br>of both Sakra and Isana, and began to urge the former (to make no delay<br>in destroying Vritra). The form that Indra assumed on the eve of the<br>encounter, while seated on his car and while his praises were being<br>hymned by the Rishis, became such that none could look at it without<br>awe.'"[1393]
