                            "Vaisampayana said, 'When Bhishma, after having said this, became silent,<br>Yudhishthira (and the others) returned home. The king addressing his<br>brothers with Vidura forming the fifth, said, 'The course of the world<br>rests upon Virtue, Wealth, and Desire. Amongst these three, which is the<br>foremost, which the second, and which the last, in point of importance?<br>For subduing the triple aggregate (viz., lust, wrath, and covetousness),<br>upon which of the first three (viz., Virtue, Wealth, and Desire) should<br>the mind be fixed? It behoveth you all to cheerfully answer this question<br>in words that are true.' Thus addressed by the Kuru chief, Vidura, who<br>was conversant with the science of Profit, with the course of the world,<br>and with truth (that concerns the real nature of things), and possessed<br>of great brilliancy of intellect, spoke first these words, recollecting<br>the contents of the scriptures.'<br><br>"Vidura said, 'Study of the various scriptures, asceticism, gift, faith,<br>performance of sacrifices, forgiveness, sincerity of disposition,<br>compassion, truth, self-restraint, these constitute possessions of<br>Virtue. Do thou adopt Virtue. Let not thy heart ever turn away from it.<br>Both Virtue and Profit have their roots in these. I think that all these<br>are capable of being included in one term. It is by Virtue that the<br>Rishis have crossed (the world with all its difficulties). It is upon<br>Virtue, that all the worlds depend (for their existence). It is by Virtue<br>that the gods attained to their position of superiority. It is upon<br>Virtue that Profit or Wealth rests. Virtue, O king, is foremost in point<br>of merit. Profit is said to be middling. Desire, it is said by the wise,<br>is the lowest of the three. For this reason, one should live with<br>restrained soul, giving his attention to Virtue most. One should also<br>behave towards all creatures as he should towards himself.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'After Vidura had finished what he had to say,<br>Pritha's son Arjuna, well skilled in the science of Profit, and<br>conversant also with the truths of both Virtue and Profit, urged on (by<br>the drift of Yudhishthira's question), said these words.'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'This world, O king, is the field of action. Action,<br>therefore, is applauded here. Agriculture, trade, keep of cattle, and<br>diverse kinds of arts, constitute what is called Profit. Profit, again,<br>is the end of all such acts. Without Profit or Wealth, both Virtue and<br>(the objects of) Desire cannot be won. This is the declaration of the<br>Sruti. Even persons of uncleansed souls, if possessed of diverse kinds of<br>Wealth, are able to perform the highest acts of virtue and gratify<br>desires that are apparently difficult of being gratified. Virtue and<br>Desire are the limbs of Wealth as the Sruti declares. With the<br>acquisition of Wealth, both Virtue and the objects of Desire may be won.<br>Like all creatures worshipping Brahman, even persons of superior birth<br>worship a man possessed of Wealth. Even they that are attired in<br>deer-skins and bear matted locks on their heads, that are self-rest<br>rained, that smear their bodies with mire, that have their senses under<br>complete control, even they that have bald heads and that are devoted<br>Brahmacharins, and that live separated from one another, cherish a desire<br>for Wealth. Others attired in yellow robes, bearing long beards, graced<br>with modesty, possessed of learning, contented, and freed from all<br>attachments, become desirous of Wealth. Others, following the practices<br>of their ancestors, and observant of their respective duties, and others<br>desirous of heaven, do the same. Believers and unbelievers and those that<br>are rigid practisers of the highest Yoga&#8212;all certify to the excellence<br>of Wealth.[483] He is said to be truly possessed of Wealth who cherishes<br>his dependants with objects of enjoyment, and afflicts his foes with<br>punishments. Even this O foremost of intelligent men, is truly my<br>opinion. Listen, however, now to these two (viz., Nakula and Sahadeva)<br>who are about to speak.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'After Arjuna had ceased, the two sons of Madri,<br>viz., Nakula and Sahadeva, said these words of high import.'<br><br>"Nakula and Sahadeva said, 'Sitting or lying, walking and standing, one<br>should strive after the acquisition of Wealth even by the most vigorous<br>of means. If Wealth, which is difficult of acquisition and highly<br>agreeable, be earned, the person that has earned it, without doubt, is<br>seen to obtain all the objects of Desire. That Wealth which is connected<br>with Virtue, as also that Virtue which is connected with Wealth, is<br>certainly like nectar.[484] For this reason, our opinions are as follows.<br>A person without wealth cannot gratify any desire; similarly, there can<br>be no Wealth in one that is destitute of Virtue. He, therefore, who is<br>outside the pale of both Virtue and Wealth, is an object of fear unto the<br>world. For this reason, one should seek the acquisition of Wealth with a<br>devoted mind, without disregarding the requirements of Virtue. They who<br>believe in (the wisdom of) this saying succeed in acquiring whatever they<br>desire. One should first practise Virtue; next acquire Wealth without<br>sacrificing Virtue; and then seek the gratification of Desire, for this<br>should be the last act of one who has been successful in acquiring<br>Wealth.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The twin sons of the Aswins, after having said<br>these words, remained silent. Then Bhimasena began to say the following.'<br><br>"Bhimasena said, 'One without Desire never wishes for Wealth. One without<br>Desire never wishes for Virtue. One who is destitute of Desire can never<br>feel any wish. For this reason, Desire is the foremost of all the three.<br>It is under the influence of Desire that the very Rishis devote<br>themselves to penances subsisting upon fruits, of living upon roots or<br>air only. Others possessed of Vedic lore are engaged upon the Vedas and<br>their branches or upon rites of faith and sacrificial acts, or upon<br>making gifts or accepting them. Traders, agriculturists, keepers of<br>cattle, artists and artisans, and those who are employed in rites of<br>propitiation, all act from Desire. Some there are that dive unto the<br>depths of the ocean, induced by Desire. Desire, indeed, takes various<br>forms. Everything is pervaded by the principle of Desire. A man outside<br>the pale of Desire never is, was, or will be, seen in this world. This, O<br>king, is the truth. Both Virtue and Wealth are based upon Desire. As<br>butter represents the essence of curds, even so is Desire the essence of<br>Profit and Virtue. Oil is better than oil-seeds. Ghee is better than sour<br>milk. Flowers and fruits are better than wood. Similarly, Desire is<br>better than Virtue and Profit. As honeyed juice is extracted from<br>flowers, so is Desire said to be extracted from these two. Desire is the<br>parent of Virtue and Profit. Desire is the soul of these two. Without<br>Desire the Brahmanas would never give either sweets or wealth unto<br>Brahmanas. Without Desire the diverse kinds of action that are seen in<br>the world would never have been seen. For these reasons, Desire is seen<br>to be the foremost of the triple aggregate. Approaching beautiful damsels<br>attired in excellent robes, adorned with every ornament, and exhilarated<br>with sweet wines, do thou sport with them. Desire, O king, should be the<br>foremost of the three with us. Reflecting upon the question to its very<br>roots, I have come to this conclusion. Do not hesitate to accept this<br>conclusion, O son of Dharma! These words of mine are not of hollow<br>import. Fraught with righteousness as they are they will be acceptable to<br>all good men. Virtue, Profit, and Desire should all be equally attended<br>to. That man who devotes himself to only one of them is certainly not a<br>superior person. He is said to be middling who devotes himself to only<br>two of them. He, on the other hand, is the best of his species who<br>attends to all the three. Having said these words in brief as also in<br>detail, unto those heroes, Bhima possessed of wisdom, surrounded by<br>friends, smeared with sandal-paste, and adorned with excellent garlands<br>and ornaments, remained silent.[485] Then king Yudhishthira the just,<br>that foremost of virtuous men, possessed of great learning, properly<br>reflecting for a while upon the words spoken by all of them, and thinking<br>all those speeches to be false philosophy, himself spoke as follows.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Without doubt, all of you have settled conclusions<br>in respect of the scriptures, and all of you are conversant with<br>authorities. These words fraught with certainty that you have spoken have<br>been heard by me. Listen now, with concentrated attention, to what I say<br>unto you. He who is not employed in merit or in sin, he who does not<br>attend to Profit, or Virtue, or Desire, who is above all faults, who<br>regards gold and a brick-bat with equal eyes, becomes liberated from<br>pleasure and pain and the necessity of accomplishing his purposes. All<br>creatures are subject to birth and death. All are liable to waste and<br>change. Awakened repeatedly by the diverse benefits and evils of life,<br>all of them applaud Emancipation. We do not know, however, what<br>Emancipation is. The self-born and divine Brahman has said that there is<br>no Emancipation for him who is bound with ties of attachment and<br>affection. They, however, that are possessed of learning seek Extinction.<br>For this reason, one should never regard anything as either agreeable or<br>disagreeable.[486] This view seems to be the best. No one in this world<br>can act as he pleases. I act precisely as I am made (by a superior power)<br>to act. The great Ordainer makes all creatures proceed as He wills. The<br>Ordainer is Supreme. Know this, all of you.[487] No one can, by his acts,<br>obtain what is unobtainable. That which is to be, takes place. Know this.<br>And since he who has withdrawn himself from the triple aggregate may<br>succeed in winning Emancipation, it seems, therefore, that Emancipation<br>is productive of the highest good.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having listened to all these foremost words<br>fraught with reason and acceptable to the heart, Bhima and others were<br>filled with delight and joining their hands, bowed unto that prince o f<br>Kuru's race. Indeed, those foremost of men, O king, having heard that<br>speech of the monarch, well adorned with sweet letters and syllables,<br>acceptable to the heart, and divested of dissonant sounds and words,<br>began to applaud Yudhishthira highly. The high-souled son of Dharma, in<br>return, possessed of great energy, praised his convinced auditors; and<br>once more the king addressed the son of the foremost of rivers, possessed<br>of a high soul, for enquiring about duties.'"
