                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, whence and how happiness and<br>misery come to those that are rich, as also those that are poor, but who<br>live in the observance of different practices and rites.'[521]<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative of<br>what was sung by Sampaka who had obtained tranquillity and achieved<br>emancipation for himself. In former times a certain Brahmana, rendered<br>miserable by a bad wife, bad dress, and hunger, and living in the<br>observance of the vow of renunciation, told me these verses,[522]<br>'Diverse kinds of sorrow and happiness overtake, from the day of birth<br>the person that is born on the earth. If he could ascribe either of them<br>to the action of Destiny, he would not then feel glad when happiness came<br>or miserable when sorrow overtook him. Though thy mind is divested of<br>desire, thou bearest yet a heavy load. Thou dost not seek to achieve thy<br>good (i.e., emancipation). Art thou not successful in controlling thy<br>mind? If thou goest about, having renounced home and desirable<br>possessions, thou shalt taste real happiness. A person divested of<br>everything sleepeth in happiness, and awaketh in happiness. Complete<br>poverty, in this world, is happiness. It is a good regimen, it is the<br>source of 'blessings, it is freedom from danger. This foeless path is<br>unattainable (by persons cherishing desire) and is easily attainable (by<br>those that are freed from desire). Casting my eyes on every part of the<br>three worlds, I do not behold the person who is equal to a poor man of<br>pure conduct and without attachment (to worldly things). I weighed<br>poverty and sovereignty in a balance. Poverty weighed heavier than<br>sovereignty and seemed to possess greater merits. Between poverty and<br>sovereignty there is this great distinction, viz., that the sovereign,<br>possessed of affluence, is always agitated by anxiety and seems to be<br>within the very jaws of death. As regards, however, the poor man, who in<br>consequence of the divestment of all wealth has freed himself from hopes<br>and emancipated himself, neither fire, nor foe, nor death, nor robbers,<br>can get the better of him. The very gods applaud such a man who wanders<br>about according to his sweet will, who lies down on the bare ground with<br>his arm for a pillow, and who is possessed of tranquillity. Affected by<br>wrath and cupidity, the man of affluence is stained by a wicked heart. He<br>casts oblique glances and makes dry speeches.&#8212;He becomes sinful, and his<br>face is always darkened with frowns. Biting his lips, and excited with<br>wrath, he utters harsh and cruel words. If such a man desires to even<br>make a gift of the whole world, who is there that would like even to look<br>at him? Constant companionship with Prosperity stupefies a person of weak<br>judgment. It drives off his judgment like the wind driving off the<br>autumnal clouds. Companionship with Prosperity induces him to think,&#8212;I<br>am possessed of beauty! I am possessed of wealth! I am high-born! I meet<br>with success in whatever I undertake! I am not an ordinary human<br>being!&#8212;His heart becomes intoxicated in consequence of these three<br>reasons. With heart deeply attached to worldly possessions, he wastes the<br>wealth hoarded by his sires. Reduced to want, he then regards the<br>appropriation of other people's wealth as blameless. At this stage, when<br>he transgresses all barriers and beings to appropriate the possessions of<br>others from every side, the rulers of men obstruct and afflict him like<br>sportsmen afflicting with keen shafts a deer that is espied in the woods.<br>Such a man is then overwhelmed with many other afflictions of a similar<br>kind that originate in fire and weapons. Therefore, disregarding all<br>worldly propensities (such as desire for children and wives) together<br>with all fleeting unrealities (such as the body, etc.,) one should, aided<br>by one's intelligence, apply proper medicine for the cure of those<br>painful afflictions. Without Renunciation one can never attain to<br>happiness. Without Renunciation one can never obtain what is for one's<br>highest good. Without Renunciation one can never sleep at case.<br>Therefore, renouncing everything, make happiness thy own. All this was<br>said to me in past times at Hastinapur by a Brahmana about what Sampaka<br>had sung. For this reason, I regard Renunciation to be the foremost of<br>things.'"
