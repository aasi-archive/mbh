                            "Yudhishthira said, 'These lords of earth that lie on the earth's surface<br>amid their respective hosts, these princes endued with great might, are<br>now reft of animation. Every one of these mighty monarchs was possessed<br>of strength equal to that of ten thousand elephants. Alas! these have all<br>been slain by men possessed of equal prowess and might. I do not behold<br>any one else (in the world) that could slay any of these men in<br>battle.[1109] All of them were endued with great prowess, great energy,<br>and great strength. Possessed also of great wisdom, they are now lying on<br>the bare ground, deprived of life. With respect to all these men that are<br>deprived of life, the word that is used is that they are dead. Of<br>terrible prowess, all these kings are said to be dead. On this subject a<br>doubt has arisen in my mind. Whence is animation and whence is death? Who<br>is it that dies? (Is it the gross body, the subtile body, or the Soul,<br>that dies)? Whence is death? For what reason also doth death takeaway<br>(living creatures)? O grandsire, tell me this, O thou that resemblest a<br>celestial!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In days of old, in the Krita age, O son, there was a king<br>of the name of Anukampaka. His cars and elephants and horses and men<br>having been reduced in number, he was brought under the sway of his foes<br>in battle. His son named Hari, who resembled Narayana himself in<br>strength, was in that battle slain by his foes along with all his<br>followers and troops. Afflicted with grief on account of the death of his<br>son, and himself brought under the sway of foes, the king devoted himself<br>thence to a life of tranquillity. One day, while wandering without a<br>purpose he met the sage Narada on the earth. The monarch told Narada all<br>that had happened, viz., the death of his son in battle and his own<br>capture by his enemies. Having heard his words, Narada, possessed of<br>wealth of penances, then recited to him the following narrative for<br>dispelling his grief on account of the death of his son.'<br><br>"Narada said, 'Listen now, O monarch, to the following narrative of<br>rather lengthy details as these had occurred. I myself heard it formerly,<br>O king! Endued with great energy, the Grandsire, at the time of the<br>creation of the universe, created a large number of living beings. These<br>multiplied greatly, and none of them met with death. There was no part of<br>the universe that was not overcrowded with living creatures, O thou of<br>unfading glory! Indeed, O king, the three worlds seemed to swell with<br>living beings, and became as it were breathless. Then, O monarch, the<br>thought arose in the Grandsire's mind as to how he should destroy that<br>overgrown population. Reflecting on the subject, the Self-born, however,<br>could not decide what the means should be by which the destruction of<br>life was to be brought about. Thereupon, O king, Brahman gave way to<br>wrath, and in consequence of his wrath a fire issued out of his body.<br>With that fire born of his wrath, the Grandsire burnt all the quarters of<br>the universe, O monarch. Indeed, that conflagration born of the Divine<br>lord's anger, O king, burnt heaven and earth and the firmament and the<br>whole universe with all its mobile and immobile beings. Truly, when the<br>Grandsire thus gave way to wrath, all mobile and immobile beings began to<br>be consumed by the irresistible energy of that passion. Then the divine<br>and auspicious Sthanu, that slayer of hostile heroes, that lord of the<br>Vedas and the scriptures, filled with compassion, sought to gratify<br>Brahman. When Sthanu came to Brahman from motives of benevolence, the<br>great God burning with energy, addressed him, saying, 'Thou deservest<br>boons at my hands. What desire of thine shall I accomplish? I shall do<br>thee good by accomplishing whatever is in thy breast.'"
