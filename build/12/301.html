                            "Yudhishthira said, 'It behoveth thee to explain to me, O sire, what the<br>difference is between the Sankhya and the Yoga system of philosophy. O<br>foremost one of Kuru's race, everything is known to thee, O thou that art<br>conversant with all duties!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The followers of Sankhya praise the Sankhya system and<br>those regenerate persons that are Yogins praise the Yoga system. For<br>establishing the superiority of their respective systems, each calls his<br>own system to be the better. Men of wisdom devoted to Yoga assign proper<br>and very good reasons, O crusher of foes, for showing that one that does<br>not believe in the existence of God cannot attain to Emancipation. Those<br>regenerate persons, again, that are believers in the Sankhya doctrines<br>advance good reasons for showing that one, by acquiring true knowledge of<br>all ends, becomes dissociated from all worldly objects, and, after<br>departing from this body, it is plain, becomes emancipated and that it<br>cannot be otherwise. Men of great wisdom have thus expounded the Sankhya<br>philosophy of Emancipation. When reasons are thus balanced on both sides,<br>those that are assigned on that side which one is otherwise inclined to<br>adopt as one's own, should be accepted. Indeed, those words that are said<br>on that side should be regarded as beneficial. Good men may be found on<br>both sides. Persons like thee may adopt either opinion. The evidences of<br>Yoga are addressed to the direct ken of the senses; those of Sankhya are<br>based on the scriptures. Both systems of philosophy are approved by me, O<br>Yudhishthira. Both those systems of science, O king, have my concurrence<br>and are concurred in by those that are good and wise. If practised duly<br>according to the instructions laid down, both would, O king, cause a<br>person to attain to the highest end. In both systems purity is equally<br>recommended as also compassion towards all creatures, O sinless one. In<br>both, again, the observance of vows has been equally laid down. Only the<br>scriptures that point out their paths are different.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'If the vows, the purity, the compassion, and the<br>fruits thereof recommended in both systems be the same, tell me, O<br>grandsire, for what reason then are not their scriptures (in respect of<br>the paths recommended) the same?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'By casting off, through the aid of Yoga, these five<br>faults, viz., attachment, heedlessness, affection, lust, and wrath, one<br>attains to Emancipation. As large fishes, breaking through the pet, pass<br>into their own element (for ranging in felicity), after the same manner,<br>Yogins (breaking through lust and wrath, etc.) become cleansed of all<br>sins and attain to the felicity of Emancipation. As powerful animals,<br>breaking through the nets in which hunters enmesh them, escape into the<br>felicity of freedom, after the same manner, Yogins, freed from all bonds,<br>attain to the sinless path that leads to Emancipation. Truly, O king,<br>breaking through the bonds born of cupidity, Yogins, endued with<br>strength, attain to the sinless and auspicious and high path of<br>Emancipation. Feeble animals, O monarch, entangled in nets, are without<br>doubt, destroyed. Even such is the case with persons destitute of the<br>puissance of Yoga. As weak fishes, O son of Kunti, fallen into the net,<br>become entangled in it, even so, O monarch, men destitute of the<br>puissance of Yoga, encounter destruction (amid the bonds of the world).<br>As birds, O chastiser of foes, when entangled in the fine nets of fowlers<br>(if weak) meet with their ruin but if endued with strength effect their<br>escape, after the same manner does it happen with Yogins, O chastiser of<br>foes. Bound by the bonds of action, they that are weak meet with<br>destruction, while they that are possessed of strength break through<br>them. A small and weak fire, O king, becomes extinguished when large logs<br>of timber are placed upon it. Even so the Yogin that is weak, O king,<br>meets with ruin (when brought in contact with the world and its<br>attachments). The same fire, however, O monarch, when it becomes strong,<br>would (without being extinguished) burn with the aid of the wind, the<br>whole Earth. After the same manner, the Yogin, when grown in strength,<br>burning with energy, and possessed of might, is capable of scorching the<br>entire Universe like the Sun that rises at the time of 'the universal<br>dissolution. As a weak man, O king, is swept away by a current, even so<br>is a weak Yogin helplessly carried away by objects of the senses. An<br>elephant withstands a mighty current. After the same manner, a Yogin,<br>having acquired Yoga-puissance, withstands all objects of the senses.<br>Independent of all things, Yogins, endued with Yoga-puissance and<br>invested with lordship, enter into (the hearts of) the very lords of<br>creation, the Rishis, the deities, and the great Beings in the universe.<br>Neither Yama, nor the Destroyer, nor Death himself of terrible prowess,<br>when angry, ever succeeds in prevailing over the Yogin, O king, who is<br>possessed of immeasurable energy. The Yogin, acquiring Yoga-puissance,<br>can create thousands of bodies and with them wander over the earth. Some<br>amongst them enjoy objects of the senses and then once more set<br>themselves to the practice of the austerest penances, and once again,<br>like the Sun (withdrawing his rays), withdraw themselves from such<br>penances.[1582] The Yogin, who is possessed of strength and whom bonds<br>bind not, certainly succeeds in attaining to Emancipation. I have now<br>discoursed to thee, O monarch, on all these powers of Yoga. I shall once<br>more tell thee what the subtile powers of Yoga are with their<br>indications. Rear, O chief of Bharata's race, the subtile indications of<br>the Dharana and the Samadhi of the Soul (such as Yoga brings<br>about).[1583] As a bowman who is heedful and attentive succeeds in<br>striking the aim, even so the Yogin. with absorbed soul, without doubt,<br>attains to Emancipation. As a man fixing his mind on a vessel full of<br>some liquid (placed on his head) heedfully ascends a flight of steps,<br>even so the Yogin, fixed and absorbed in his soul, cleanses it and makes<br>it as effulgent as the Sun. As a boat, O son of Kunti, that is tossed on<br>the bosom of the sea is very soon taken by a heedful boatman to the other<br>shore, even so the man of knowledge by fixing his soul in Samadhi,<br>attains to Emancipation, which is so difficult to acquire, after casting<br>off his body, O monarch. As a heedful charioteer, O king, having yoked<br>good steeds (unto his car) takes the car-warrior to the spot he wishes,<br>even so the Yogin, O monarch, heedful in Dharana, soon attains to the<br>highest spot (viz., Emancipation) like a shaft let off from the bow<br>reaching the object aimed at. The Yogin who stays immovably after having<br>entered his self into the soul, destroys his sins and obtains that<br>indestructible spot which is the possession of those that are righteous.<br>That Yogin who, heedfully observant of high vows, properly unites O king,<br>his Jiva-soul with the subtile Soul in the navel, the throat, the head,<br>the heart, the chest, the sides, the eye, the ear, and the nose, burns<br>all his acts good and bad of even mountain-like proportions, and having<br>recourse to excellent Yoga, attains to Emancipation.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'It behoveth thee to tell me, O grandsire, what the<br>kinds of diet are by taking which, and what the things are by conquering<br>which, the Yogin, O Bharata, acquires Yoga-puissance.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Engaged, O Bharata, in subsisting upon broken grains<br>of rice and sodden cakes of sesame, and abstaining from oil and butter,<br>the Yogin acquires Yoga-puissance. By subsisting for a long time on<br>powdered barley unmixed with any liquid substance, and by confining<br>himself to only one meal a day, the Yogin, of cleansed soul, acquires<br>Yoga-puissance. By drinking only water mixed with milk, first only once<br>during the day, then once during a fortnight, then once during a month,<br>then once during three months, and then once during a whole year, the<br>Yogin acquires Yoga-puissance. By abstaining entirely from meat, O king,<br>the Yogin of cleansed soul acquires puissance.[1584] By subjugating lust,<br>and wrath, and heat, and cold and rain, and fear, and grief, and the<br>breath, and all sounds that are agreeable to men, and objects of the<br>senses, and the uneasiness, so difficult to conquer, that is born of<br>abstention from sexual congress, and thirst that is so terrible, O king,<br>and the pleasures of touch, and sleep, and procrastination that is almost<br>unconquerable, O best of kings, high-souled Yogins, divested of<br>attachments, and possessed of great wisdom, aided by their<br>understandings, and equipped with wealth of contemplation and study,<br>cause the subtile soul to stand confessed in all its glory. This high<br>(Yoga) path of learned Brahmanas is exceedingly difficult to tread. No<br>one can walk along this path with ease. That path is like a terrible<br>forest which abounds with innumerable snakes and crawling vermin, with<br>(concealed) pits occurring every where, without water for slaking one's<br>thirst, and full of thorns, and inaccessible on that account. Indeed, the<br>path of Yoga is like a road along which no edibles occur, which runs<br>through a desert having all its trees burnt down in a conflagration, and<br>which has been rendered unsafe by being infested with bands of robbers.<br>Very few young men can pass safely through it (for reaching the goal).<br>Like unto a path of this nature, few Brahmanas can tread alone the<br>Yoga-path with ease and comfort. That man who, having betaken himself to<br>this path, ceases to go forward (but turns back after having made some<br>progress), is regarded as guilty of many faults. Men of cleansed souls, O<br>lord of Earth, can stay with ease upon Yoga-contemplation which is like<br>the sharp edge of a razor. Persons of uncleansed souls, however, cannot<br>stay on it. When Yoga-contemplation becomes disturbed or otherwise<br>obstructed, it can never lead the Yogin to an auspicious end even as a<br>vessel that is without a captain cannot take the passengers to the other<br>shore. That man, O son of Kunti, who practises Yoga-contemplation<br>according to due rites, succeeds in casting off both birth and death, and<br>happiness and sorrow. All this that I have told thee has been stated in<br>the diverse treatises bearing upon Yoga. The highest fruits of Yoga are<br>seen in persons of the regenerate order. That highest fruit is<br>identification with Brahma. The high-souled Yogin, possessed of<br>greatness, can enter into and come out of, at his will, Brahma himself<br>who is the lord of all deities, and the boon-giving Vishnu, and Bhava,<br>and Dharma, and the six-faced Kartikeya, and the (spiritual) sons of<br>Brahmana, the quality of Darkness that is productive of much pain, and<br>that of Passion, and that of Sattwa which is pure, and Prakriti which is<br>the highest, and the goddess Siddhi who is the spouse of Varuna, and all<br>kinds of energy, and all enduring patience, and the bright lord of stars<br>in the firmament with the stars twinkling all around, and the Viswas. and<br>the (great) snakes, and the Pitris, and all the mountains and hills, and<br>the great and terrible oceans, and all the rivers, and the rain-charged<br>clouds, and serpents, and trees, and Yakshas, and the cardinal and<br>subsidiary points of the compass, and the Gandharvas, and all male<br>persons and all female ones also. This discourse, O king, that is<br>connected with the Supreme Being of mighty energy should be regarded as<br>auspicious. The Yogin has Narayana for his soul. Prevailing over all<br>things (through his contemplation of the Supreme deity), the high-souled<br>Yogin is capable of creating all things.'"<br><br>The end of the Santi Parva [, Part two of three].
