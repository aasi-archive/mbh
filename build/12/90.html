                            "Bhishma said, 'That foremost of all persons conversant with the Vedas,<br>viz., Utathya of Angirasa's race, discoursed cheerfully (on former<br>occasion) unto Yuvanaswa's son Mandhatri. I shall now, O Yudhishthira,<br>recite to thee everything that Utathya, that foremost of all persons<br>conversant with the Vedas, had said unto that king.'<br><br>"Utathya said, 'One becomes a king for acting in the interests of<br>righteousness and not for conducting himself capriciously. Know this, O<br>Mandhatri; the king is, indeed, the protector of the world. If the king<br>acts righteously, he attains to the position of a god.[266] On the other<br>hand, if fie acts unrighteously, he sinks into hell. All creatures rest<br>upon righteousness. Righteousness, in its turn, rests upon the king. That<br>king, therefore, who upholds righteousness, is truly a king. That king<br>who is endued with a righteous soul and with every kind of grace is said<br>to be an embodiment of virtue. If a king fails to chastise<br>unrighteousness, the gods desert his mansion and he incurs obloquy among<br>men. The efforts of men who are observant of their own duties are always<br>crowned with success. For this reason all men seek to obey the dictates<br>of righteousness which are productive of prosperity. When sinfulness is<br>not restrained, righteous behaviour comes to an end and unrighteous<br>behaviour increases greatly. When sinfulness is not restrained, no one<br>can, according to the rights of property as laid down in the scriptures,<br>say, 'This thing is mine and this is not mine.' When sinfulness prevails<br>in the world, men cannot own and enjoy their own wives and animals and<br>fields and houses. The deities receive no worship, the Pitris no<br>offerings in Sraddhas, and guests no hospitality, when sinfulness is not<br>restrained. The regenerate classes do not study the Vedas, or observe<br>high vows, or spread out sacrifices, when sinfulness is not restrained.<br>The minds of men, O king, become weak and confounded like those of<br>persons wounded with weapons, when sinfulness is not restrained. Casting<br>their eyes on both the worlds, the Rishis made the king, that superior<br>being, intending that he should be the embodiment of righteousness on<br>earth.[267] He is called Rajan in whom righteousness shines. That king,<br>again in whom there is no righteousness, is called a Vrishala.[268] The<br>divine Dharma (righteousness) has another name, viz., Vrisha. He who<br>weakens Vrisha is called by the name of Vrishala. A king should,<br>therefore, advance the cause of righteousness. All creatures grow in the<br>growth of righteousness, and decay with its decay. Righteousness,<br>therefore, should never be permitted to decay. Righteousness is called<br>Dharma because it aids the acquisition and preservation of wealth<br>(Dhana). The sages, O king, have declared that Dharma restrains and set<br>bounds to all evil acts of men. The self-born (Brahman) created Dharma<br>for the advancement and growth of creatures. For this reason, a king<br>should act according to the dictates of Dharma for benefiting his<br>subjects. For this reason also, O tiger among kings, Dharma has been said<br>to be the foremost of all things. That foremost of men who rules his<br>subjects righteously is called a king. Disregarding lust and wrath,<br>observe thou the dictates of righteousness. Among all things, O chief of<br>Bharata's race, that conduce to the prosperity of kings, righteousness is<br>the foremost. Dharma, again, has sprung from the Brahmana. For this<br>reason, the Brahmana should always be worshipped. Thou shouldst, O<br>Mandhatri, gratify with humility the wishes of Brahmanas. By neglecting<br>to gratify the wishes of Brahmanas, the king brings danger on himself. In<br>consequence of such neglect, he fails to obtain any accession of friends<br>while his foes increase in number. In consequence of malice towards the<br>Brahmanas springing from his folly, the goddess of prosperity who had<br>formerly dwelt with him became enraged and deserted the Asura Vali, the<br>son of Virochana. Deserting the Asura she repaired to Indra, the chief of<br>the deities. Beholding the goddess living with Purandara, Vali indulged<br>in many vain regrets. This, O puissant one, is the results of malice and<br>pride. Be thou awakened, O Mandhatri, so that the goddess of prosperity<br>may not in wrath desert thee. The Srutis declare that Unrighteousness<br>begat a son named Pride upon the goddess of prosperity. This Pride, O<br>king, led many among the gods and the Asuras to ruin. Many royal sages<br>also have suffered destruction on his account. Do thou, therefore,<br>awaken, O king! He who succeeds in conquering him becomes a king. He, on<br>the other hand, who suffers himself to be conquered by him, becomes a<br>slave. If, O Mandhatri, thou wishest for an eternal life (of felicity),<br>live as a king should that does not indulge in these two, viz., Pride and<br>Unrighteousness! Abstain from companionship with him that is intoxicated<br>(with pride), him that is heedless (of the dictates of honesty), him that<br>is scoffer of religion, him that is insensate, and forbear to pay court<br>to all of them when united. Keep thy self aloof from the company of<br>ministers whom thou hast once punished and especially of women, as also<br>from mountains and uneven lands and inaccessible fastnesses and elephants<br>and horses and (noxious) reptiles. Thou shouldst also give up wandering<br>in the night, and avoid the faults of stinginess and vanity and<br>boastfulness and wrath. Thou shouldst never have intercourse with unknown<br>women, or those of equivocal sex, or those that are lewd, or those that<br>are the wives of other men, or those that are virgins. When the king does<br>not restrain vice, a confusion of castes follows, and sinful Rakshasas,<br>and persons of neutral sex, and children destitute of limbs or possessed<br>of thick tongues, and idiots, begin to take birth in even respectable<br>families. Therefore, the king should take particular care to act<br>righteously, for the benefit of his subjects. If a king acts heedlessly,<br>a great evil becomes the consequence. Unrighteousness increases causing a<br>confusion of castes. Cold sets in during the summer months, and<br>disappears when its proper season comes. Drought and flood and pestilence<br>afflict the people. Ominous stars arise and awful comets appear on such<br>occasions. Diverse other portents, indicating destruction of the kingdom,<br>make their appearance. If the king does not take measures for his own<br>safety and does not protect his subjects, the latter first meet with<br>destruction and then destruction seizes the king himself. Two persons<br>combining together snatch the wealth of one, and many acting in concert<br>rob the two. Maidens are deflowered. Such a state of things is said to<br>arise from the king's faults. All rights of property come to an end among<br>men, when the king, abandoning righteousness, acts heedlessly.'"
