                            "Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the following history of<br>olden times. That history is regarded as a high precedent amongst good<br>and wise men. That history has connection with the present topic. I heard<br>it in the hermitage of Rama, the son of Jamadagni, recited by many<br>foremost of Rishis. In a certain large forest uninhabited by human<br>beings, there lived an ascetic upon fruit and roots observing rigid vows,<br>and with his senses under control. Observant also of stringent<br>regulations and self-restraint, of tranquil and pure soul, always<br>attentive to Vedic recitations, and of heart cleansed by fasts, he<br>adopted a life of goodness towards all creatures. Possessed of great<br>intelligence, as he sat on his seat, the goodness of his behaviour having<br>been known to all the creatures that lived in that forest, they used to<br>approach him with affection. Fierce lions and tigers, infuriated<br>elephants of huge size, leopards, rhinoceroses, bears, and other animals<br>of fierce aspect, subsisting upon blood, used to come to the Rishi and<br>address him the usual questions of polite enquiry. Indeed, all of them<br>behaved towards him like disciples and slaves and always did unto him<br>what was agreeable. Coming to him they addressed the usual enquiries, and<br>then went away to their respective quarters. One domestic animal,<br>however, lived there permanently, never leaving the Muni at any time. He<br>was devoted to the sage and exceedingly attached to him. Weak and<br>emaciated with fasts, he subsisted upon fruit and roots and water, and<br>was tranquil and Of inoffensive aspect. Lying at the feet of that<br>high-souled Rishi as the latter sat, the dog, with a heart like that of a<br>human being, became exceedingly attached to him in consequence of the<br>affection with which he was treated. One day a leopard of great strength<br>came there, subsisting upon blood. Of a cruel disposition and always<br>filled with delight at the prospect of prey, the fierce animal looked<br>like a second Yama. Licking the corners of his mouth With the tongue, and<br>lashing his tail furiously, the leopard came there, hungry and thirsty,<br>with wide open jaws, desirous of seizing the dog as his prey. Beholding<br>that fierce beast coming, O king, the dog, in fear of his life, addressed<br>the Muni in these words. Listen unto them, O monarch! 'O holy one, this<br>leopard is a foe of the dogs. It wishes to slay me. O great sage, do thou<br>act in such a way that all my fears from this animal may be dispelled<br>through thy grace. O thou of mighty arms, without doubt thou art<br>possessed of omniscience.' Acquainted with the thoughts of all creatures,<br>the sage felt that the dog had ample cause for fear. Possessed of the six<br>attributes and capable of reading the voices of all animals, the sage<br>said the following words.'<br><br>"The sage said, 'Thou shalt have no fear of death from leopards any<br>longer. Let thy natural form disappear and be thou a leopard, O son!' At<br>these words, the dog was transformed into a leopard with skin bright as<br>gold. With stripes on his body and with large teeth, thenceforth he began<br>to live in that forest fearlessly. Meanwhile, the leopard, seeing before<br>him an animal of his own species, immediately forsook all feelings of<br>animosity towards it. Some time after, there came into the hermitage a<br>fierce and hungry tiger with open mouth. Licking the corners of his mouth<br>with the tongue, and eagerly desirous of drinking blood, that tiger began<br>to approach towards the animal that had been transformed into a leopard.<br>Beholding the hungry tiger of terrible teeth approach that forest, the<br>(transformed) leopard sought the Rishi's protection for saving his life.<br>The sage, who showed great affection for the leopard in consequence of<br>the latter's living in the same place with him, forthwith transformed his<br>leopard into a tiger powerful for all foes. The tiger seeing a beast of<br>his own species did him no injury, O king. The dog, having in course of<br>time been transformed into a powerful tiger subsisting upon flesh and<br>blood, abstained from his former food which had consisted of fruit and<br>roots. Indeed, from that time, O monarch, the transformed tiger lived,<br>subsisting upon the other animals of the forest, like a true king of<br>beasts.'
