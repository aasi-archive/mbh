                            Vaisampayana said, "Unto king Yudhishthira who still remained speechless<br>and plunged in grief, the island-born Vyasa, that great ascetic,<br>conversant with truths of religion, spoke again."<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'O thou of eyes like lotus petals, the protection of<br>subjects is the duty of kings. Those men that are always observant of<br>duty regard duty to be all powerful. Do thou, therefore, O king, walk in<br>the steps of thy ancestors. With. Brahmanas, penances are a duty. This is<br>the eternal ordinance of the Vedas. Penances, therefore, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, constitute the eternal duty of Brahmanas. A Kshatriya is<br>the protector of all persons in respect of their duties.[104] That man<br>who, addicted to earthly possessions, transgresses wholesome restraints,<br>that offender against social harmony, should be chastised with a strong<br>hand. That insensate person who seeks to transgress authority, be he an<br>attendant, a son, or even a saint, indeed,&#8212;all men of such sinful<br>nature, should by every means be chastised or even killed. That king who<br>conducts himself otherwise incurs sin. He who does not protect morality<br>when it is being disregarded is himself a trespasser against morality.<br>The Kauravas were trespassers against morality. They have, with their<br>followers, been slain by thee. Thou hast been observant of the duties of<br>thy own order. Why then, O son of Pandu, dost thou indulge in such grief?<br>The king should slay those that deserve death, make gifts to persons<br>deserving of charity, and protect his subjects according to the<br>ordinance.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'I do not doubt the words that fall from thy lips, O<br>thou of great ascetic merit! Everything appertaining to morality and duty<br>is well known to thee, O foremost of all persons conversant with morality<br>and duty! I have, however, for the sake of kingdom, caused many persons<br>to be slain! Those deeds, O Brahmana, are burning and consuming me!'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'O Bharata, is the Supreme Being the doer, or is man the<br>doer? Is everything the result of Chance in the world, or are the fruits<br>that we enjoy or suffer, the results of (previous) action? If man, O<br>Bharata, does all acts, good or bad, being urged thereto by the Supreme<br>Being, then the fruits of those acts should attach to the Supreme being<br>himself. If a person cuts down, with an axe, a tree in forest, it is the<br>person that incurs the sin and not the axe by any means. Or, if it be<br>said that, the axe being only the material cause, the consequence of the<br>act (of cutting) should attach to the animate agent (and not to the<br>inanimate tool), then the sin may be said to belong to the person that<br>has made the axe. This, however, can scarcely be true. If this be not<br>reasonable, O son of Kunti, that one man should incur the consequence of<br>an act done by another, then, guided by this, thou shouldst throw all<br>responsibility upon the Supreme Being.[105] If, again, man be himself the<br>agent of all his acts virtuous and sinful, then Supreme Director there is<br>none, and, therefore, whatever thou hast done cannot bring evil<br>consequences on thee.[106] No one, O king, can ever turn away from that<br>which is destined. If, again, Destiny be the result of the acts of former<br>lives, then no sin can attach to one in this life even as the sin of<br>cutting down a tree cannot touch the maker of the axe.[107] If thou<br>thinkest it is chance only that acts in the world, then such an act of<br>destruction could never happen nor will ever happen.[108] If it is<br>necessary to ascertain what is good and what is evil in the world, attend<br>to the scriptures. In those scriptures it has been laid down that kings<br>should stand with the rod of chastisement uplifted in their hands. I<br>think, O Bharata, that acts, good and bad, are continually revolving here<br>as a wheel, and men obtain the fruits of those acts, good or bad, that<br>they do. One sinful act proceeds from another. Therefore, O tiger among<br>kings, avoid all evil acts and do not thus set thy heart upon grief. Thou<br>shouldst adhere, O Bharata, to the duties, even if reproachable, of thy<br>own order. This self-destruction, O king, does not look well in thee.<br>Expiations, O king, have been ordained for (evil) acts. He that is alive<br>can perform them, but he that dies fails in their performance. Therefore,<br>O king without laying down thy life, perform those expiatory acts. If<br>thou dost not perform them thou mayst have to repent in the next world.'
