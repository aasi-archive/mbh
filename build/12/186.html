                            "Bharadwaja said, 'If it is the wind that keeps us alive, if it is the<br>wind that causes us to move and exert, if it is the wind that causes us<br>to breathe and to speak, then it seems that life is worth little. If the<br>animal heat (that digests all food) be of the nature of fire, and if it<br>is that fire which assists at digestion by dissolving the food we take,<br>then life is worth little. When an animal dies, that which is called its<br>life is never seen leaving it. Only the breath leaves it, and the<br>internal heat becomes extinguished. If life were nothing else, than wind,<br>or if life depended only on the wind, then it could have been seen like<br>the external sea of air, and when passing out it would have mingled with<br>that air. If life dependest upon air, and if it ended with the escape of<br>that air from the body, it would then mingle with another portion of air<br>(that exists externally) like a portion of water escaping into the great<br>ocean and thereby only changing the place of its residence. If a quantity<br>of water be thrown into a well, or if the flame of a lamp be thrown into<br>a blazing fire, either of them, entering a homogeneous element, loses its<br>independent or separate existence. If life were air, it also, when the<br>animal died, would mingle with the great ocean of air outside. How can we<br>say that there is life in this animal body which is made up of the five<br>(primal) elements? If one of those elements disappear, the union of the<br>other four becomes dissolved. The element of water drieth up if food be<br>not taken. The element of air disappears if the breath be restrained. The<br>element of space disappears if the excretions cease. So also the element<br>of fire becomes extinguished if food does not go in. The element of earth<br>breaks in pieces in consequence of diseases, wounds, and other<br>sufferings. If only one of the five becomes afflicted, the union, being<br>dissolved, the five go away into five different directions. When the body<br>which is a union of the elements, becomes separated into five<br>ingredients, whither doth life go? What doth it then know? What doth it<br>then hear? What doth it then say? This cow (that is given away to a holy<br>Brahmana), it is said, will rescue me in the other world. The animal,<br>however, that is given away, itself dies. Whom then will this cow rescue?<br>The taker of the cow (in gift) and the giver are both equal (in being<br>both subject to death). Both of them meet with extinction in this world.<br>How then will they meet again? How will the person that has been eaten up<br>by birds, or that has been broken in pieces by a fall from a mountain<br>summit, or that has been consumed by fire, regain life? The root of a<br>tree that has been cut down does not grow up again. Only the seeds put<br>forth sprouts. Where is the person who having died comes back (to some<br>sort of new existence)? Only seeds were originally created. All this<br>universe is the result of seeds in succession. They that die, die to<br>perish Seeds result from seeds.'"
