                            "Bharadwaja said, 'What has been said to be the consequence of gift? What<br>of Righteousness? What of conduct? What of Penances well-performed? What<br>of the study and recitation of the Vedas? And what of pouring libations<br>upon the fire?'<br><br>'Bhrigu said, 'By pouring libations on the sacred fire, sin is burnt. By<br>study of the Vedas one obtains blessed tranquillity. By gift, one obtains<br>pleasure and articles of enjoyment. By Penances, one acquires blessed<br>heaven. Gift is said to be of two kinds: gifts for the other world, and<br>those for this. Whatever is given to the good attends the giver in the<br>other world. Whatever is given to those that are not good produces<br>consequences enjoyable here. The consequences of gifts are commensurate<br>with the gifts themselves.'<br><br>"Bharadwaja said, 'What course of duties should be performed by whom?<br>What also are the characteristics of duty? How many kinds of duty are<br>there? It behoveth thee to tell me these.'[572]<br><br>"Bhrigu said, 'Those wise men who are engaged in practising the duties<br>laid down for them succeed in obtaining heaven as their reward. By doing<br>otherwise people become guilty of folly.'<br><br>"Bharadwaja said, 'It behoveth thee to tell me about the four modes of<br>life that were formerly laid down by Brahman, and the practices ordained<br>for each of them.'<br><br>"Bhrigu said, 'In days of yore, the divine Brahman, for benefiting the<br>world, and for the protection of righteousness, indicated four modes of<br>life.[573] Amongst them, residence in the abode of the preceptor is<br>mentioned as the first (in order of time). He who is in this mode of life<br>should have his soul cleansed by purity of conduct, by Vedic rites, and<br>by restraints and vows and humility. He should worship the morning and<br>evening twilights, the Sun, his own sacred fire, and the deities. He<br>should cast off procrastination and idleness. He should cleanse his soul<br>by saluting his preceptor, by studying the Vedas, and by listening to his<br>preceptor's instructions. He should perform his ablutions thrice (viz.,<br>in the morning, noon, and evening). He should lead a life of celibacy;<br>attend to his sacred fire; dutifully serve his preceptor; daily go out on<br>a round of mendicancy (for supporting himself); and give ungrudgingly<br>unto his preceptor the whole of what is obtained in alms. Willingly<br>accomplishing everything that the commands of his preceptor may indicate,<br>he should be ready to receive such Vedic instruction as his preceptor may<br>give him as a favour.[574] On this subject there is a verse: That<br>Brahmana who obtains his Veda by attending with reverence upon his<br>preceptor, succeeds in attaining to heaven and obtains the fruition of<br>all his desires. The domestic mode of life is called the second (in point<br>of time). We shall explain to you all the pious acts and indications of<br>that mode. Those who having completed their residence in the preceptor's<br>abode return home, who are of pious conduct, who desire the fruits of a<br>virtuous course of behaviour with spouses in their company, have this<br>mode of life ordained for them. In it Virtue, Wealth, and Pleasure, may<br>all be obtained. It is (thus) suited to the cultivation of the triple<br>aggregate. Acquiring wealth by irreproachable acts, or with wealth of<br>high efficacy which is obtained from recitation of the Vedas, or living<br>upon such means as are utilised by the regenerate Rishis,[575] or with<br>the produce of mountains and mines, or with the wealth represented by the<br>offerings made in sacrifices and on the termination of vows and other<br>observances, and those made unto deities, the householder should lead<br>this mode of life. That mode of life is regarded as the root of all the<br>others. They who are residents in the abodes of preceptors, they who lead<br>lives of mendicancy, and others who live in the observance of vows and<br>restraints to which they are pledged, derive from this mode the means<br>they live upon, the offerings they make unto the Pitris and the deities,<br>and, in short, their entire support. The third mode of life is called the<br>Forest-life. For those that lead it, there is no storing of wealth and<br>articles.[576] Generally, these pious and good men, subsisting upon good<br>food, and engaged in studying the Vedas, roam ever the earth for<br>journeying to tirthas and visiting diverse realms. Standing up, advancing<br>forward, sweet speeches uttered in sincerity, gifts according to the<br>measure of the giver's competence, offer of seats and beds of the best<br>kind, and presents of excellent food, are some of the means for showing<br>them regard. On this subject there is a verse: If a guest turns away from<br>a house with expectations unfulfilled, he is supposed to take away the<br>merits of the householder and leave the latter all his misdeeds. Then<br>again in the domestic mode of life the deities are gratified by<br>sacrifices and other religious rites; the Pitris by the performance of<br>obsequial rites; the Rishis by cultivation of (Vedic) knowledge, by<br>listening to the instructions of preceptors, and by committing to memory<br>the scriptures; and lastly the Creator by begetting children.[577] On<br>this subject there are two verses: One in the observance of this mode of<br>life should speak upon all creatures words breathing affection and<br>agreeable to the ears. To give pain, to inflict mortifications, and harsh<br>words, are all censurable. Insult, arrogance, and deceit, also should be<br>avoided. Abstention from injury, truth, and absence of wrath, produce the<br>merit of penances in all the (four) modes of life. In the domestic mode<br>of life these are allowed, viz., the use and enjoyment of floral<br>garlands, ornaments, robes, perfumed oils and unguents; enjoyment of<br>pleasures derived from dancing and music, both vocal and instrumental,<br>and all sights and scenes that are agreeable to the sight; the enjoyment<br>of various kinds of viands and drinks belonging to the principal orders<br>of edibles, viz., those that are swallowed, those that are lapped, those<br>that are quaffed, and those that are sucked; and the enjoyment of<br>pleasures derivable from sports and every kind of amusement and the<br>gratification of desires. That man who in the observance of this mode of<br>life seeks the acquisition of the triple aggregate (viz., Religion,<br>Wealth, and Pleasure), with that of the great end of the three attributes<br>of Goodness and Passion and Darkness,[578] enjoys great happiness here<br>and at last attains to the end that is reserved for persons that are<br>virtuous and good.[579] Even that householder who observes the duties of<br>his mode of life by following the practice of picking up fallen grains of<br>corn from the cracks of fields and who abandons sensual pleasure and<br>attachment to action, does not find it difficult to obtain heaven.'"
