                            "Surya said, 'This Being is not the god of fire, he is not an Asura. Nor<br>is he a Naga. He is a Brahmana who has attained to heaven in consequence<br>of his having been crowned with success in the observance of the vow<br>called Unccha.[1941] This person had subsisted upon fruits and roots and<br>upon the fallen leaves of trees. He had sometimes subsisted upon water,<br>and sometimes upon air alone, passing his days with concentrated soul.<br>The deity Mahadeva had been gratified by him with constant recitation of<br>the Samhitas. He had endeavoured to accomplish those acts that lead to<br>heaven. Through the merits of those acts he hath now attained to heaven.<br>Without wealth and without desire of any kind, he had observed the vow<br>called Unccha in the matter of his sustenance. This learned Brahmana, ye<br>Nagas, had been devoted to the good of all creatures. Neither deities,<br>nor Gandharvas, nor Asuras, nor Nagas, can be regarded as superior to<br>those creatures that attain to this excellent end of coming into the<br>solar disc?&#8212;Even such, O regenerate one, was the wonderful incident that<br>I beheld on that occasion. That Brahmana, who was crowned with success by<br>the observance of the Unccha vow and who thus obtained an end that<br>persons crowned with ascetic success acquire, to this day, O regenerate<br>one, goes round the Earth, staying in the disc of Surya!'"
