                            "Tuladhara said, 'See with thy own eyes, O Jajali, who, viz., those that<br>are good or those that are otherwise, have adopted this path of duty that<br>I have spoken of. Thou shalt then understand properly how the truth<br>stands. Behold, many birds are hovering in the sky. Amongst them are<br>those that were reared on thy head, as also many hawks and many others of<br>other species. Behold, O Brahmana, those birds have contracted their<br>wings and legs for entering their respective nests. Summon them, O<br>regenerate one! There those birds, treated with affection by thee, are<br>displaying their love for thee that art their father. Without doubt, thou<br>art their father, O Jajali! Do thou summon thy children.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Then those birds, summoned by Jajali, made answer<br>agreeably to the dictates of that religion which is not fraught with<br>injury to any creature.[1188] All acts that are done without injuring any<br>creature become serviceable (to the doer) both here and hereafter. Those<br>acts, however, that involve injury to others, destroy faith, and faith<br>being destroyed, involves the destroyer in ruin. The sacrifices of those<br>that regard acquisition and non-acquisition in the same light, that are<br>endued with faith that are self-restrained, that have tranquil minds, and<br>that perform sacrifices from a sense of duty (and not from desire of<br>fruit), become productive of fruit.[1189] Faith with respect to Brahma is<br>the daughter of Surya, O regenerate one. She is the protectress and she<br>is the giver of good birth. Faith is superior to the merit born of<br>(Vedic) recitations and meditation.[1190] An act vitiated by defect of<br>speech is saved by Faith. An act vitiated by defect of mind is saved by<br>Faith. But neither speech nor mind can save an act that is vitiated by<br>want of Faith.[1191] Men conversant with the occurrences of the past<br>recite in this connection the following verse sung by Brahman. The<br>offerings in sacrifices of a person that is pure (in body and acts) but<br>wanting in Faith, and of another that is impure (in respect of their<br>worthiness of acceptance). The food, again, of a person conversant with<br>the Vedas but miserly in behaviour, and that of a usurer that is liberal<br>in conduct,[1192] the deities after careful consideration, had held to be<br>equal (in respect of their worthiness of acceptance). The' Supreme Lord<br>of all creatures (viz., Brahman) then told them that they had committed<br>an error. The food of a liberal person is sanctified by Faith. The food,<br>however, of the person that is void of Faith is lost in consequence of<br>such want of Faith. The food of a liberal usurer is acceptable but not<br>the food of a miser.[1193] Only one person in the world, viz., he that is<br>bereft of Faith, is unfit to make offerings to the deities. The food of<br>only such a man is unfit to be eaten. This is the opinion of men<br>conversant with duties. Want of Faith is a high sin. Faith is a cleanser<br>of sins. Like a snake casting off its slough, the man of Faith succeeds<br>in casting off all his sin. The religion of abstention with Faith is<br>superior to all things considered sacred. Abstaining from all faults of<br>behaviour, he who betakes himself to Faith, becomes sanctified. What need<br>hath such a person of penances, or of conduct, or of endurance? Every man<br>has Faith. Faith, however, is of three kinds, viz., as affected by<br>Sattwa, by Rajas and by Tamas, and according to the kind of Faith that<br>one has, one is named. Persons endued with goodness and possessed of<br>insight into the true import of morality have thus laid down the subject<br>of duties. We have, as the result of our enquiries, got all this from the<br>sage Dharmadarsana. O thou of great wisdom, betake thyself to Faith, for<br>thou shalt then obtain that which is superior. He who has Faith (in the<br>declarations of the Srutis), and who acts according to their import (in<br>the belief that they are good for him), is certainly of righteous soul. O<br>Jajali, he who adheres to his own path (under the influence of Faith) is<br>certainly a superior person.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'After a short while, Tuladhara and Jajali, both of<br>whom had been endued with great wisdom, ascended to heaven and sported<br>there in great happiness,[1194] having reached their respective places<br>earned by their respective acts. Many truths of this kind were spoken of<br>by Tuladhara. That eminent person understood this religion (of abstention<br>from injury) completely. These eternal duties were accordingly proclaimed<br>by him. The regenerate Jajali, O son of Kunti, having heard these words<br>of celebrated energy, betook himself to tranquillity. In this way, many<br>truths of grave import were uttered by Tuladhara, illustrated by examples<br>for instruction. What other truths dost thou wish to hear?'"
