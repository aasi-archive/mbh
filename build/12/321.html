                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Without abandoning the domestic mode of life, O<br>royal sage of Kuru's race, who ever attained to Emancipation which is the<br>annihilation of the Understanding (and the other faculties)? Do tell me<br>this! How may the gross and the subtile form be cast off? Do thou also, O<br>grandsire, tell me what the supreme excellence of Emancipation is.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative of the<br>discourse between Janaka and Sulabha, O Bharata! In days of yore there<br>was a king of Mithila, of the name of Dharmadhyaja, of Janaka's race. He<br>was devoted to the practices of the religion of Renunciation. He was well<br>conversant with the Vedas, with the scriptures on Emancipation, and with<br>the scriptures bearing on his own duty as a king. Subjugating his senses,<br>he ruled his Earth. Hearing of his good behaviour in the world, many men<br>of wisdom, well-conversant with wisdom, O foremost of men, desired to<br>imitate him. 'In the same Satya Yuga, a woman of the name of Sulabha,<br>belonging to the mendicant order, practised the duties of Yoga and<br>wandered over the whole Earth. In course of her wanderings over the<br>Earth, Sulabha heard from many Dandis of different places that the ruler<br>of Mithila was devoted to the religion of Emancipation. Hearing this<br>report about king Janaka and desirous of ascertaining whether it was true<br>or not, Sulabha became desirous of having a personal interview with<br>Janaka. Abandoning, by her Yoga powers, her former form and features,<br>Sulabha assumed the most faultless features and unrivalled beauty. In the<br>twinkling of an eye and with the speed of the quickest shaft, the<br>fair-browed lady of eyes like lotus-petals repaired to the capital of the<br>Videhas. Arrived at the chief city of Mithila teeming with a large<br>population, she adopted the guise of a mendicant and presented herself<br>before the king. The monarch, beholding, her delicate form, became filled<br>with wonder and enquired who she was, whose she was, and whence she came.<br>Welcoming her, he assigned her an excellent seat, honoured her by<br>offering water to wash her feet, and gratified her with excellent<br>refreshments. Refreshed duly and gratified with the rites of hospitality<br>offered unto her, Sulabha, the female mendicant, urged the king, who was<br>surrounded by his ministers and seated in the midst of learned scholars,<br>(to declare himself in respect of his adherence to the religion of<br>Emancipation). Doubting whether Janaka had succeeded in attaining to<br>Emancipation, by following the religion of Nivritti, Sulabha, endued with<br>Yoga-power, entered the understanding of the king by her own<br>understanding. Restraining, by means of the rays of light that emanated<br>from her own eyes, the rays issuing from the eyes of the king, the lady,<br>desirous of ascertaining the truth, bound up king Janaka with Yoga<br>bonds.[1677]' That best of monarch, priding himself upon his own<br>invincibleness and defeating the intentions of Sulabha seized her<br>resolution with his own resolution.[1678] The king, in his subtile form,<br>was without the royal umbrella and sceptre. The lady Sulabha, in hers,<br>was without the triple stick. Both staying then in the same (gross) form,<br>thus conversed with each other. Listen to that conversation as it<br>happened between the monarch and Sulabha.<br><br>"Janaka said, O holy lady, to what course of conduct art thou devoted?<br>Whose art thou? Whence hast thou come? After finishing thy business here,<br>whither wilt thou go? No one can, without questioning, ascertain<br>another's acquaintance with the scriptures, or age, or order of birth.<br>Thou shouldst, therefore, answer these questions of mine, when thou has<br>come to me. Know that I am truly freed from all vanity in respect of my<br>royal umbrella and sceptre. I wish to know thee thoroughly. Thou art<br>deserving I hold, of my respect.[1679] Do thou listen to me as I speak to<br>thee on Emancipation for there is none else (in this world) that can<br>discourse to thee on that topic. Hear me also I tell thee who that person<br>is from whom in days of old I acquired this distinguishing<br>knowledge.[1680] I am the beloved disciple of the high-souled and<br>venerable Panchasikha, belonging to the mendicant order, of Parasara's<br>race. My doubts have been dispelled and am fully conversant with the<br>Sankhya and the Yoga systems, and the ordinances as in respect of<br>sacrifices and other rites, which constitutes the three well-known paths<br>of Emancipation.[1681] Wandering over the earth and pursuing the while<br>the path that is pointed out by the scriptures, the learned Panchasikha<br>formerly dwelt in happiness in my abode for a period of four months in<br>the rainy season. That foremost of Sankhyas discoursed to me, agreeably<br>to the truth, and in an intelligible manner suited to my comprehension,<br>on the several kinds of means for attaining to Emancipation. He did not,<br>however, command me to give up my kingdom. Freed from attachments, and<br>fixing my Soul on supreme Brahma, and unmoved by companionship, I lived,<br>practising in its entirety that triple conduct which is laid down in<br>treatises on Emancipation. Renunciation (of all kinds of attachments) is<br>the highest means prescribed for Emancipation. It is from Knowledge that<br>Renunciation, by which one becomes freed is said to flow. From Knowledge<br>arises the endeavour after Yoga, and through that endeavour one attains<br>to knowledge of Self or Soul. Through knowledge of Self one transcends<br>joy and grief. That enables one to transcend death and attain to high<br>success. That high intelligence (knowledge of Self) has been acquired by<br>me, and accordingly I have transcended all pairs of opposites. Even in<br>this life have I been freed from stupefaction and have transcended all<br>attachments. As a soil, saturated with water and softened thereby, causes<br>the (sown) seed to sprout forth, after the same manner, the acts of men<br>cause rebirth. As a seed, fried on a pan or otherwise, becomes unable to<br>sprout forth although the capacity for sprouting was there, after the<br>same manner my understanding having been freed from the productive<br>principle constituted by desire, by the instruction of the holy<br>Panchasikha of the mendicant order, it no longer produces its fruit in<br>the form of attachment to the object of the senses. I never experience<br>love for my spouse or hate for my foes. Indeed, I keep aloof from both,<br>beholding the fruitlessness of attachment and wrath. I regard both<br>persons equally, viz., him that smears my right hand with sandal-paste<br>and him that wounds my left. Having attained my (true) object, I am<br>happy, and look equally upon a clod of earth, a piece of stone, and a<br>lump of gold. I am freed from attachments of every kind, though am<br>engaged in ruling a kingdom. In consequence of all this I am<br>distinguished over all bearers of triple sticks. Some foremost of men<br>that are conversant with the topic of Emancipation say that Emancipation<br>has a triple path, (these are knowledge, Yoga, and sacrifices and rites).<br>Some regard knowledge having all things of the world for its object as<br>the means of emancipation. Some hold that the total renunciation of acts<br>(both external and internal) is the means thereof. Another class of<br>persons conversant with the scriptures of Emancipation say that Knowledge<br>is the single means. Other, viz. Yatis, endued with subtile vision, hold<br>that acts constitute the means. The high-souled Panchasikha, discarding<br>both the opinion about knowledge and acts, regarded the third as the only<br>means of Emancipation. If men leading the domestic mode of life be endued<br>with Yama and Niyama, they become the equals of Sannyasins. If, on the<br>other hand, Sannyasins be endued with desire and aversion and spouses and<br>honour and pride and affection, they become the equals of men leading<br>domestic modes of life.[1682] If one can attain to Emancipation by means<br>of knowledge, then may Emancipation exist in triple sticks (for there is<br>nothing to prevent the bearers of such stick from acquiring the needful<br>knowledge). Why then may Emancipation not exist in the umbrella and the<br>sceptre as well, especially when there is equal reason in taking up the<br>triple stick and the sceptre?[1683] One becomes attached to all those<br>things and acts with which one has need for the sake of one's own self<br>for particular reasons.[1684] If a person, beholding the faults of the<br>domestic mode of life, casts it off for adopting another mode (which he<br>considers to be fraught with great merit), be cannot, for such rejection<br>and adoption be regarded as one that is once freed from all attachments,<br>(for all that he has done has been to attach himself to a new mode after<br>having freed himself from a previous one).[1685] Sovereignty is fraught<br>with the rewarding and the chastising of others. The life of a mendicant<br>is equally fraught with the same (for mendicants also reward and chastise<br>those they can). When, therefore, mendicants are similar to kings in this<br>respect, why would mendicants only attain to Emancipation, and not kings?<br>Notwithstanding the possession of sovereignty, therefore, one becomes<br>cleansed of all sins by means of knowledge alone, living the while in<br>Supreme Brahma. The wearing of brown cloths, shaving of the head, bearing<br>of the triple stick, and the Kamandalu,&#8212;these are the outward signs of<br>one's mode of life. These have no value in aiding one to the attainment<br>of Emancipation. When, notwithstanding the adoption of these emblems of a<br>particular mode of life, knowledge alone becomes the cause of one's<br>Emancipation from sorrow, it would appear that the adoption of mere<br>emblems is perfectly useless. Or, if, beholding the mitigation of sorrow<br>in it, thou hast betaken thyself to these emblems of Sannyasi, why then<br>should not the mitigation of sorrow be beheld in the umbrella and the<br>sceptre to which I have betaken myself? Emancipation does not exist in<br>poverty; nor is bondage to be found in affluence. One attains to<br>Emancipation through Knowledge alone, whether one is indigent or<br>affluent. For these reasons, know that I am living in a condition of<br>freedom, though ostensibly engaged in the enjoyments of religion, wealth,<br>and pleasure, in the form of kingdom and spouses, which constitute a<br>field of bondage (for the generality of men). The bonds constituted by<br>kingdom and affluence, and the bondage to attachments, I have cut off<br>with the sword of Renunciation whetted on the stone of the scriptures<br>bearing upon Emancipation. As regards myself then, I tell thee that I<br>have become freed in this way. O lady of the mendicant order, I cherish<br>an affection for thee. But that should not prevent me from telling thee<br>that thy behaviour does not correspond with the practices of the mode of<br>life to which thou hast betaken thyself! Thou hast great delicacy of<br>formation. Thou hast an exceedingly shapely form. The age is young. Thou<br>hast all these, and thou hast Niyama (subjugation of the senses). I doubt<br>it verily. Thou hast stopped up my body (by entering into me with the aid<br>of the Yoga power) for ascertaining as to whether I am really emancipated<br>or not. This act of thine ill corresponds with that mode of life whose<br>emblems thou bearest. For Yogin that is endued with desire, the triple<br>stick is unfit. As regards thyself, thou dost not adhere to thy stick. As<br>regards those that are freed, it behoves even them to protect themselves<br>from fall.[1686] Listen now to me as to what thy transgression has been<br>in consequence of thy contact with me and thy having entered into my<br>gross body with the aid of thy understanding. To what reason is thy<br>entrance to be ascribed into my kingdom or my palace? At whose sign hast<br>thou entered into my heart?[1687] Thou belongest to the foremost of all<br>the orders, being, as thou art, a Brahmana woman. As regards myself,<br>however, I am a Kshatriya. There is no union for us two. Do not help to<br>cause an intermixture of colours. Thou livest in the practice of those<br>duties that lead to Emancipation. I live in the domestic mode of life,<br>This act of thine, therefore, is another evil thou hast done, for it<br>produces an unnatural union of two opposite modes of life. I do not know<br>whether thou belongest to my own gotra or dost not belong to it. As<br>regards thyself also, thou dost not know who I am (viz., to what gotra I<br>belong). If thou art of my own gotra, thou hast, by entering into my<br>person, produced another evil,&#8212;the evil, viz., of unnatural union. If,<br>again, thy husband be alive and dwelling in a distant place, thy union<br>with me has produced the fourth evil of sinfulness, for thou art not one<br>with whom I may be lawfully united. Dost thou perpetrate all these sinful<br>acts, impelled by the motive of accomplishing a particular object? Dost<br>thou do these from ignorance or from perverted intelligence? If, again,<br>in consequence of thy evil nature thou hast thus become thoroughly<br>independent or unrestrained in thy behaviour, I tell thee that if thou<br>hast any knowledge of the scriptures, thou wilt understand that<br>everything thou hast done has been productive of evil. A third fault<br>attaches to thee in consequence of these acts of thine, a fault that is<br>destructive of peace of mind. By endeavouring to display thy superiority,<br>the indication of a wicked woman is seen in thee. Desirous of asserting<br>thy victory as thou art, it is not myself alone whom thou wishest to<br>defeat, for it is plain that thou wishest to obtain a victory over even<br>the whole of my court (consisting of these learned and very superior<br>Brahmanas), by casting thy eyes in this way towards all these meritorious<br>Brahmanas, it is evident that thou desirest to humiliate them all and<br>glorify thyself (at their expense). Stupefied by thy pride of<br>Yoga-puissance that has been born of thy jealousy (at sight of my power,)<br>thou hast caused a union of thy understanding with mine and thereby hast<br>really mingled together nectar with poison. That union, again, of man and<br>woman, when each covets the other, is sweet as nectar. That association,<br>however, of man and woman when the latter, herself coveting, fails to<br>obtain an individual of the opposite sex that does not covet her, is,<br>instead of being a merit, only a fault that is as noxious as poison. Do<br>not continue to touch me. Know that I am righteous. Do thou act according<br>to thy own scriptures. The enquiry thou hadst wished to make, viz.,<br>whether I am or I am not emancipated, has been finished. It behoves thee<br>not to conceal from me all thy secret motives. It behoves thee not, that<br>thus disguisest thyself, to conceal from me what thy object is, that is<br>whether this call of thine has been prompted by the desire of<br>accomplishing some object of thy own or whether thou hast come for<br>accomplishing the object of some other king (that is hostile to me). One<br>should never appear deceitfully before a king; nor before a Brahmana; nor<br>before one's wife when that wife is possessed of every wifely virtue.<br>Those who appear in deceitful guise before these three very soon meet<br>with destruction. The power of kings consists in their sovereignty. The<br>power of Brahmanas conversant with the Vedas is in the Vedas. Women wield<br>a high power in consequence of their beauty and youth and blessedness.<br>These then are powerful in the possession of these powers. He, therefore,<br>that is desirous of accomplishing his own object should always approach<br>these three with sincerity and candour, insincerity and deceit fail to<br>produce success (in these three quarters). It behoveth thee, therefore,<br>to apprise me of the order to which thou belongest by birth, of thy<br>learning and conduct and disposition and nature, as also of the object<br>thou hast in view in coming to this place!&#8212;"<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Though rebuked by the king in these unpleasant,<br>improper, and ill-applied words, the lady Sulabha was not at all abashed.<br>After the king had said these words, the beautiful Sulabha then addressed<br>herself for saying the following words in reply that were more handsome<br>than her person.<br><br>"'Sulabha said, O king, speech ought always to be free from the nine<br>verbal faults and the nine faults of judgment. It should also, while<br>setting forth the meaning with perspicuity, be possessed of the eighteen<br>well-known merits.[1688] Ambiguity, ascertainment of the faults and<br>merits of premises and conclusions, weighing the relative strength or<br>weakness of those faults and merits, establishment of the conclusion, and<br>the element of persuasiveness or otherwise that attaches to the<br>conclusion thus arrived at,&#8212;these five characteristics appertaining to<br>the sense&#8212;constitute the authoritativeness of what is said. Listen now<br>to the characteristics of these requirements beginning with ambiguity,<br>one after another, as I expound them according to the combinations. When<br>knowledge rests on distinction in consequence of the object to be known<br>being different from one another, and when (as regards the comprehension<br>of the subject) the understanding rests upon many points one after<br>another, the combination of words (in whose case this occurs) is said to<br>be vitiated by ambiguity.[1689] By ascertainment (of faults and merits),<br>called Sankhya, is meant the establishment, by elimination, of faults or<br>merits (in premises and conclusions), adopting tentative meanings.[1690]<br>Krama or weighing the relative strength or weakness of the faults or<br>merits (ascertained by the above process), consists in settling the<br>propriety of the priority or subsequence of the words employed in a<br>sentence. This is the meaning attached to the word Krama by persons<br>conversant with the interpretation of sentences or texts. By Conclusion<br>is meant the final determination, after this examination of what has been<br>said on the subjects of religion, pleasure, wealth, and Emancipation, in<br>respect of what is particularly is that has been said in the text.[1691]<br>The sorrow born of wish or aversion increases to a great measure. The<br>conduct, O king, that one pursues in such a matter (for dispelling the<br>sorrow experienced) is called Prayojanam.[1692] Take it for certain, O<br>king, at my word, that these characteristics of Ambiguity and the other<br>(numbering five in all), when occurring together, constitute a complete<br>and intelligible sentence.[1693] The words I shall utter will be fraught<br>with sense, free from ambiguity (in consequence of each of them not being<br>symbols of many things), logical, free from pleonasm or tautology,<br>smooth, certain, free from bombast, agreeable or sweet, truthful, not<br>inconsistent with the aggregate of three, (viz., Righteousness, Wealth<br>and Pleasure), refined (i.e., free from Prakriti), not elliptical or<br>imperfect, destitute of harshness or difficulty of comprehension,<br>characterised by due order, not far-fetched in respect of sense,<br>corrected with one another as cause and effect and each having a specific<br>object.[1694] I shall not tell thee anything, prompted by desire or wrath<br>or fear or cupidity or abjectness or deceit or shame or compassion or<br>pride. (I answer thee because it is proper for me to answer what thou<br>hast said). When the speaker, the hearer, and the words said, thoroughly<br>agree with one another in course of a speech, then does the sense or<br>meaning come out very clearly. When, in the matter of what is to be said,<br>the speaker shows disregard for the understanding of the hearer by<br>uttering words whose meaning is understood by himself, then, however good<br>those words may be, they become incapable of being seized by the<br>hearer.[1695] That speaker, again, who, abandoning all regard for his own<br>meaning uses words that are of excellent sound and sense, awakens only<br>erroneous, impressions in the mind of the hearer. Such words in such<br>connection become certainly faulty. That speaker, however, who employs<br>words that are, while expressing his own meaning, intelligible to the<br>hearer, as well, truly deserves to be called a speaker. No other man<br>deserves the name. It behoveth thee, therefore, O king, to hear with<br>concentrated attention these words of mine, fraught with meaning and<br>endued with wealth of vocables. Thou hast asked me who I am, whose I am,<br>whence I am coming, etc. Listen to me, O king, with undivided mind, as I<br>answer these questions of thine. As lac and wood, as grains of dust and<br>drops of water, exist commingled when brought together, even so are the<br>existences of all creatures.[1696] Sound, touch, taste, form, and scent,<br>these and the senses, though diverse in respect of their essences, exist<br>yet in a state of commingling like lac and wood. It is again well known<br>that nobody asks any of these, saying, who art thou? Each of them also<br>has no knowledge either of itself or of the others. The eye cannot see<br>itself. The ear cannot hear itself. The eye, again, cannot discharge the<br>functions of any of the other senses, nor can any of the senses discharge<br>the functions of any sense save its own. If all of them even combine<br>together, even they fail to know their own selves as dust and water<br>mingled together cannot know each other though existing in a state of<br>union. In order to discharge their respective functions, they await the<br>contact of objects that are external to them. The eye, form, and light,<br>constitute the three requisites of the operation called seeing. The same,<br>as in this case, happens in respect of the operations of the other senses<br>and the ideas which is their result. Then, again, between the functions<br>of the senses (called vision, hearing, etc.,) and the ideas which are<br>their result (viz., form, sound, etc.), the mind is an entity other than<br>the senses And is regarded to have an action of its own. With its help<br>one distinguishes what is existent from what is non-existent for arriving<br>at certainty (in the matter of all ideas derived from the senses). With<br>the five senses of knowledge and five senses of action, the mind makes a<br>total of eleven. The twelfth is the Understanding. When doubt arises in<br>respect of what is to be known, the Understanding comes forward and<br>settles all doubts (for aiding correct apprehension). After the twelfth,<br>Sattwa is another principle numbering the thirteenth. With its help<br>creatures are distinguished as possessing more of it or less of it in<br>their constitutions.[1697] After this, Consciousness (of self) is another<br>principle (numbering the fourteenth). It helps one to an apprehension of<br>self as distinguished from what is not self. Desire is the fifteenth<br>principle, O king. Unto it inhere the whole universe.[1698] The sixteenth<br>principle is Avidya. Unto it inhere the seventeenth and the eighteenth<br>principles called Prakriti and Vyakti (i.e., Maya and Prakasa). Happiness<br>and sorrow, decrepitude and death, acquisition and loss, the agreeable<br>end the disagreeable,&#8212;these constitute the nineteenth principle and are<br>called couples of opposites. Beyond the nineteenth principle is another,<br>viz., Time called the twentieth. Know that the births and death of all<br>creatures are due to the action of this twentieth principle. These twenty<br>exist together. Besides these, the five Great primal elements, and<br>existence and non-existence, bring up the tale to seven and twenty.<br>Beyond these, are three others, named Vidhi, Sukra, and Vala, that make<br>the tale reach thirty.[1699] That in which these ten and twenty<br>principles occur is said to be body. Some persons regard unmanifest<br>Prakriti to be the source or cause of these thirty principles. (This is<br>the view of the atheistic Sankhya school). The Kanadas of gross vision<br>regard the Manifest (or atoms) to be their cause. Whether the Unmanifest<br>or the Manifest be their cause, or whether the two (viz., the Supreme or<br>Purusha and the Manifest or atoms) be regarded as their cause, or<br>fourthly, whether the four together (viz., the Supreme or Purusha and his<br>Maya and Jiva and Avidya or Ignorance) be the cause, they that are<br>conversant with Adhyatma behold Prakriti as the cause of all creatures.<br>That Prakriti which is Unmanifest, becomes manifest in the form of these<br>principles. Myself, thyself, O monarch, and all others that are endued<br>with body are the result of that Prakriti (so far as our bodies are<br>concerned). Insemination and other (embryonic) conditions are due to the<br>mixture of the vital seed and blood. In consequence of insemination the<br>result which first appears is called by the name of 'Kalala.' From<br>'Kalala' arises what is called Vudvuda (bubble). From the stage called<br>'Vudvuda' springs what is called 'Pesi.' From the condition called 'Pesi'<br>that stage arises in which the various limbs become manifested. From this<br>last condition appear nails and hair. Upon the expiration of the ninth<br>month, O king of Mithila, the creature takes its birth so that, its sex<br>being known, it comes to be called a boy or girl. When the creature<br>issues out of the womb, the form it presents is such that its nails and<br>fingers seem to be of the hue of burnished copper. The next stage is said<br>to be infancy, when the form that was seen at the time of birth becomes<br>changed. From infancy youth is reached, and from youth, old age. As the<br>creature advances from one stage into another, the form presented in the<br>previous stage becomes changed. The constituent elements of the body,<br>which serve diverse functions in the general economy, undergo change<br>every moment in every creature. Those changes, however, are so minute<br>that they cannot be noticed.[1700] The birth of particles, and their<br>death, in each successive condition, can not be marked, O king, even as<br>one cannot mark the changes in the flame of a burning lamp.[1701] When<br>such is the state of the bodies of all creatures,&#8212;that is when that<br>which is called the body is changing incessantly even like the rapid<br>locomotion of a steed of good mettle,&#8212;who then has come whence or not<br>whence, or whose is it or whose is it not, or whence does it not arise?<br>What connection does there exist between creatures and their own<br>bodies?[1702] As from the contact of flint with iron, or from two sticks<br>of wood when rubbed against each other, fire is generated, even so are<br>creatures generated from the combination of the (thirty) principles<br>already named. Indeed, as thou thyself seest thy own body in thy body and<br>as thou thyself seest thy soul in thy own soul, why is it that thou dost<br>not see thy own body and thy own soul in the bodies and souls of others?<br>If it is true that thou seest an identity with thyself and others, why<br>then didst thou ask me who I am and whose? If it is true that hast, O<br>king been freed from the knowledge of duality that (erroneously)<br>says&#8212;this is mine and this other is not mine,&#8212;then what use is there<br>with such questions as Who art thou, whose art thou and whence dost thou<br>come? What indications of Emancipation can be said to occur in that king<br>who acts as others act towards enemies and allies and neutrals and in<br>victory and truce and war? What indications of Emancipation occur in him<br>who does not know the true nature of the aggregate of three as manifested<br>in seven ways in all acts and who, on that account, is attached to that<br>aggregate of three?[1703] What indications of Emancipation exist in him<br>who fails to cast an equal eye on the agreeable, on the weak, and the<br>strong? Unworthy as thou art of it, thy pretence of Emancipation should<br>be put down by thy counsellers! This thy endeavour to attain to<br>Emancipation (when thou hast so many faults) is like the use of medicine<br>by a patient who indulges in all kinds of forbidden food and practices. O<br>chastiser of foes, reflecting upon spouses and other sources of<br>attachment, one should behold these in one's own soul. What else can be<br>looked upon as the indication of Emancipation? Listen now to me as I<br>speak in detail of these and certain other minute sources of attachment<br>appertaining to the four well known acts (of lying down for slumber,<br>enjoyment, eating, and dressing) to which thou art still bound though<br>thou professest thyself to have adopted the religion of Emancipation.<br>That man who has to rule the whole world must, indeed, be a single king<br>without a second. He is obliged to live in only a single palace. In that<br>palace he has again only one sleeping chamber. In that chamber he has,<br>again, only one bed on which at night he is to lie down. Half that bed<br>again he is obliged to give to his Queen-consort. This may serve as an<br>example of how little the king's share is of all he is said to own. This<br>is the case with his objects of enjoyment, with the food he eats, and<br>with the robes he wears. He is thus attached to a very limited share of<br>all things. He is, again, attached to the duties of rewarding and<br>punishing. The king is always dependent on others. He enjoys a very small<br>share of all he is supposed to own, and to that small share he is forced<br>to be attached (as well as others are attached to their respective<br>possessions). In the matter also of peace and war, the king cannot be<br>said to be independent. In the matter of women, of sports and other kinds<br>of enjoyment, the king's inclinations are exceedingly circumscribed. In<br>the matter of taking counsel and in the assembly of his councillors what<br>independence can the king be said to have? When, indeed, he sets his<br>orders on other men, he is said to be thoroughly independent. But then<br>the moment after, in the several matters of his orders, his independence<br>is barred by the very men whom he has ordered.[1704] If the king desires<br>to sleep, he cannot gratify his desire, resisted by those who have<br>business to transact with him. He must sleep when permitted, and while<br>sleeping he is obliged to wake up for attending to those that have urgent<br>business with him&#8212;bathe, touch, drink, eat, pour libations on the fire,<br>perform sacrifices, speak, hear,&#8212;these are the words which kings have to<br>hear from others and hearing them have to slave to those that utter them.<br>Men come in batches to the king and solicit him for gifts. Being,<br>how-ever, the protector of the general treasury, he cannot make gifts<br>unto even the most deserving. If he makes gifts, the treasury becomes<br>exhausted. If he does not, disappointed solicitors look upon him with<br>hostile eyes. He becomes vexed and as the result of this, misanthropical<br>feelings soon invade his mind. If many wise and heroic and wealthy men<br>reside together, the king's mind begins to be filled with distrust in<br>consequence. Even when there is no cause of fear, the king entertains<br>fear of those that always wait upon and worship him. Those I have<br>mentioned O king, also find fault with him. Behold, in what way the<br>king's fears may arise from even them! Then again all men are kings in<br>their own houses. All men, again, in their own houses are house-holders.<br>Like kings, O Janaka, all men in their own houses chastise and reward.<br>Like kings others also have sons and spouses and their own selves and<br>treasuries and friends and stores. In these respects the king is not<br>different from other men.&#8212;The country is ruined,&#8212;the city is consumed<br>by fire,&#8212;the foremost of elephants is dead,&#8212;at all this the king yields<br>to grief like others, little regarding that these impressions are all due<br>to ignorance and error. The king is seldom freed from mental griefs<br>caused by desire and aversion and fear. He is generally afflicted also by<br>headaches and diverse diseases of the kind. The king is afflicted (like<br>others) by all couples of opposites (as pleasure and pain, etc). He is<br>alarmed at everything. Indeed, full of foes and impediments as kingdom<br>is, the king, while he enjoys it, passes nights of sleeplessness.<br>Sovereignty, therefore, is blessed with an exceedingly small share of<br>happiness. The misery with which it is endued is very great. It is as<br>unsubstantial as burning flames fed by straw or the bubbles of froth seen<br>on the surface of water. Who is there that would like to obtain<br>sovereignty, or having acquired sovereignty can hope to win tranquillity?<br>Thou regardest this kingdom and this palace to be thine. Thou thinkest<br>also this army, this treasury, and these counsellers to belong to thee.<br>Whose, however, in reality are they, and whose are they not? Allies,<br>ministers, capital, provinces, punishment, treasury, and the king, these<br>seven which constitute the limbs of a kingdom exist, depending upon one<br>another, like three sticks standing with one another's support. The<br>merits of each are set off by the merits of the others. Which of them can<br>be said to be superior to the rest? At those times those particular ones<br>are regarded as distinguished above the rest when some important end is<br>served through their agency. Superiority, for the time being, is said to<br>attach to that one whose efficacy is thus seen. The seven limbs already<br>mentioned, O best of kings, and the three others, forming an aggregate of<br>ten, supporting one another, are said to enjoy the kingdom like the king<br>himself.[1705] That king who is endued with great energy and who is<br>firmly attached to Kshatriya practices, should be satisfied with only a<br>tenth part of the produce of the subject's field. Other kings are seen to<br>be satisfied with less than a tenth part of such produce. There is no one<br>who owns the kingly office without some one else owning it in the world,<br>and there is no kingdom without a king.[1706] If there be no kingdom,<br>there can be no righteousness, and if there be no righteousness, whence<br>can Emancipation arise? Whatever merit is most sacred and the highest,<br>belongs to kings and kingdoms.[1707] By ruling a kingdom well, a king<br>earns the merit that attaches to a Horse-sacrifice with the whole Earth<br>given away as Dakshina. But how many kings are there that rule their<br>kingdoms well? O ruler of Mithila, I can mention hundreds and thousands<br>of faults like these that attach to kings and kingdoms. Then, again, when<br>I have no real connection with even my body, how then can I be said to<br>have any contact with the bodies of others? Thou canst not charge me with<br>having endeavoured to bring about an intermixture of castes. Hast thou<br>heard the religion of Emancipation in its entirety from the lips of<br>Panchasikha together with its means, its methods, its practices, and its<br>conclusion?[1708] If thou hast prevailed over all thy bonds and freed<br>thyself from all attachments, may I ask thee, O king, who thou preservest<br>thy connections still with this umbrella and these other appendages of<br>royalty? I think that thou hast not listened to the scriptures, or, thou<br>hast listened to them without any advantage, or, perhaps, thou hast<br>listened to some other treatises looking like the scriptures. It seems<br>that thou art possessed only of worldly knowledge, and that like an<br>ordinary man of the world thou art bound by the bonds of touch and<br>spouses and mansions and the like. If it be true that thou Met been<br>emancipated from all bonds, what harm have I done thee by entering thy<br>person with only my Intellect? With Yatis, among all orders of men, the<br>custom is to dwell in uninhabited or deserted abodes. What harm then have<br>I done to whom by entering thy understanding which is truly of real<br>knowledge? I have not touched thee, O king, with my hands, of arms, or<br>feet, or thighs, O sinless one, or with any other part of the body. Thou<br>art born in a high race. Thou hast modesty. Thou hast foresight. Whether<br>the act has been good or bad, my entrance into thy body has been a<br>private one, concerning us two only. Was it not improper for thee to<br>publish that private act before all thy court? These Brahmanas are all<br>worthy of respect. They are foremost of preceptors. Thou also art<br>entitled to their respect, being their king. Doing them reverence, thou<br>art entitled to receive reverence from them. Reflecting on all this, it<br>was not proper for thee to proclaim before these foremost of men the fact<br>of this congress between two persons of opposite sexes, if, indeed, thou<br>art really acquainted with the rules of propriety in respect of speech. O<br>king of Mithila, I am staying in thee without touching thee at all even<br>like a drop of water on a lotus leaf that stays on it without drenching<br>it in the least. If, notwithstanding instructions of Panchasikha of the<br>mendicant order, thy knowledge has become abstracted from the sensual<br>objects to which it relates? Thou hast, it is plain, fallen off from the<br>domestic mode of life but thou hast not yet attained to Emancipation that<br>is so difficult to arrive at. Thou stayest between the two, pretending<br>that thou hast reached the goal of Emancipation. The contact of one that<br>is emancipated with another that has been so, or Purusha with Prakriti,<br>cannot lead to an intermingling of the kind thou dreariest. Only those<br>that regard the soul to be identical with the body, and that think the<br>several orders and modes of life to be really different from one another,<br>are open to the error of supposing an intermingling to be possible. My<br>body is different from thine. But my soul is not different from thy soul.<br>When I am able to realise this, I have not the slightest doubt that my<br>understanding is really not staying in thine though I have entered into<br>thee by Yoga.[1709] A pot is borne in the hand. In the pot is milk. On<br>the milk is a fly. Though the hand and pot, the pot and milk, and the<br>milk and the fly, exist together, yet are they all distinct from each<br>other. The pot does not partake the nature of the milk. Nor does the milk<br>partake the nature of the fly. The condition of each is dependent on<br>itself, and can never be altered by the condition of that other with<br>which it may temporarily exist. After this manner, colour and practices,<br>though they may exist together with and in a person that is emancipate,<br>do not really attach to him. How then can an intermingling of orders be<br>possible in consequence of this union of myself with thee? Then, again, I<br>am not superior to thee in colour. Nor am I a Vaisya, nor a Sudra. I am,<br>O king, of the same order with the, borne of a pure race. There was a<br>royal sage of the name of Pradhana. It is evident that thou hast heard of<br>him. I am born in his race, and my name is Sulabha. In the sacrifices<br>performed by my ancestors, the foremost of the gods, viz., Indra, used to<br>come, accompanied by Drona and Satasringa, and Chakradwara (and other<br>presiding geniuses of the great mountains). Born in such a race, it was<br>found that no husband could be obtained for me that would be fit for me.<br>Instructed then in the religion of Emancipation, I wander over the Earth<br>alone, observant of the practices of asceticism. I practise no hypocrisy<br>in the matter of the life of Renunciation. I am not a thief that<br>appropriates what belongs to others. I am not a confuser of the practices<br>belonging to the different orders. I am firm in the practices that belong<br>to that mode of life to which I properly belong. I am firm and steady in<br>my vows. I never utter any word without reflecting on its propriety. I<br>did not come to thee, without having deliberated properly, O monarch!<br>Having heard that thy understanding has been purified by the religion of<br>Emancipation, I came here from desire of some benefit. Indeed, it was for<br>enquiring of thee about Emancipation that I had come. I do not say it for<br>glorifying myself and humiliating my opponents. But I say it, impelled by<br>sincerity only. What I say is, he that is emancipated never indulges in<br>that intellectual gladiatorship which is implied by a dialectical<br>disputation for the sake of victory. He, on the other hand, is really<br>emancipate who devotes himself to Brahma, that sole seat of<br>tranquillity.[1710] As a person of the mendicant order resides for only<br>one night in an empty house (and leaves it the next morning), even after<br>the same manner I shall reside for this one night in thy person (which,<br>as I have already said, is like an empty chamber, being destitute of<br>knowledge). Thou hast honoured me with both speech and other offers that<br>are due from a host to a guest. Having slept this one night in thy<br>person, O ruler of Mithila, which is as it were my own chamber now,<br>tomorrow I shall depart.<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Hearing these words fraught with excellent sense and<br>with reason, king Janaka failed to return any answer thereto.'"[1711]
