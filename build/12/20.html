                            Vaisampayana said, "After Yudhishthira had stopped, the great ascetic<br>Devasthana, possessed of eloquence, said these words, fraught with<br>reason, unto the king."<br><br>"Devasthana said, 'Phalguna has told thee that there is nothing superior<br>to wealth. I shall discourse to thee on that subject. Listen to me with<br>undivided attention, O Ajatasatru, thou hast righteously won the earth.<br>Having won her, it behoves thee not, O king, to abandon her without<br>cause. Four modes of life are indicated in the Vedas. Do thou, O king,<br>duly pass through them, one after another. At present thou shouldst,<br>therefore, perform great sacrifices with profuse presents. Amongst the<br>very Rishis, some are engaged in the sacrifice represented by Vedic<br>study, and some in that presented by knowledge. Therefore, O Bharata,<br>thou must know that the very ascetics also are addicted to action. The<br>Vaikhanasas, however, are said to preach that he who does not seek for<br>wealth is superior to him that seeks for it.[65] I think that he who<br>would follow that precept would incur many faults. Men collect together<br>diverse things (for the performance of sacrifices) simply because of the<br>(Vedic) ordinance. He who, tainted by his own understanding, giveth away<br>wealth to an undeserving person without giving it to the deserving, doth<br>not know that he incurs the sin of killing a foetus.[66] The exercise of<br>the duty of charity after discriminating the deserving from the<br>undeserving is not easy. The Supreme Ordainer created wealth for<br>sacrifice, and He created man also for taking care of that wealth and for<br>performing sacrifice. For this reason the whole of one's wealth should be<br>applied to sacrifice. Pleasure would follow from it as a natural<br>consequence. Possessed of abundant energy, Indra, by the performance of<br>diverse sacrifices with profuse gifts of valuables, surpassed all the<br>gods. Having got their chiefship by that means, he shineth in heaven.<br>Therefore, everything should be applied to sacrifices. Clad in<br>deer-skins, the high-souled Mahadeva, having poured his own self as a<br>libation in the sacrifice called Sarva, became the first of gods, and<br>surpassing all creatures in the universe and prevailing over them by<br>means of that achievement, shines in resplendence. King Marutta, the son<br>of Avikshit, by the profusion of his wealth, vanquished Sakra himself,<br>the chief of the gods. In the great sacrifice he performed, all the<br>vessels were of gold, and Sree herself came in person. Thou hast heard<br>that the great king Harischandra, having performed sacrifices, earned<br>great merit and great happiness. Though a man, he nevertheless vanquished<br>Sakra by his wealth. For this reason everything should be applied to<br>sacrifice.'"
