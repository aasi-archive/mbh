                            "Yudhishthira said, 'How should a righteous king, who is opposed by his<br>own officers, whose treasury and army are no longer under his control,<br>and who has no wealth, conduct himself for acquiring happiness?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection, the story of Kshemadarsin is often<br>recited. I shall narrate that story to thee. Listen to it, O<br>Yudhishthira! It has been heard by us that in days of old, when prince<br>Kshemadarsin became weak in strength and fell into great distress, he<br>repaired to the sage Kalakavrikshiya, and saluting him humbly, said unto<br>him these words.'[317]<br><br>"The king said, 'What should a person like me who deserves wealth but who<br>has, after repeated efforts, failed to recover his kingdom, do, O<br>Brahmana, excepting suicide, thieving and robbery, acceptance of refuge<br>with others, and other acts of meanness of a similar kind? O best of men,<br>tell me this. One like thee that is conversant with morality and full of<br>gratefulness is the refuge of a person afflicted by disease either mental<br>or physical. Man should cast off his desires. By acting in that way, by<br>abandoning joy and sorrow, and earning the wealth of knowledge, he<br>succeeds in obtaining felicity.[318] I grieve for them that adhere to<br>worldly happiness as dependent on wealth. All that, however, vanishes<br>like a dream. They that can abandon vast wealth achieve a very difficult<br>feat. As regards ourselves we are unable to abandon that wealth which is<br>even no longer existent.[319] I am divested of prosperity and have fallen<br>into a miserable and joyless plight. Instruct me, O Brahmana, what<br>happiness I may yet strive for.' Thus addressed by the intelligent prince<br>of Kosala, the sage Kalakavrikshiya of great splendour made the following<br>answer.'<br><br>"The sage said, 'Thou hast, it seems, already understood it. Possessed of<br>knowledge as thou art, thou shouldst act as thou thinkest. Thy belief is<br>right, viz., All this that I see is unstable, myself as also everything<br>that I have. Know, O prince, that those things which thou regardest as<br>existing are in reality non-existent. The man of wisdom knows this, and<br>accordingly is never pained whatever the distress that may overwhelm him.<br>Whatever has taken place and whatever will take place are all unreal.<br>When thou wilt know this which should be known by all, thou shalt be<br>freed from unrighteousness. Whatever things had been earned and acquired<br>by those that came before, and whatever was earned and acquired by those<br>that succeeded them, have all perished. Reflecting on this, who is there<br>that will yield to grief? Things that were, are no more. Things that are,<br>will again be (no more). Grief has no power to restore them. One should<br>not, therefore, indulge in grief. Where, O king, is thy sire to-day, and<br>where thy grandsire? Thou seest them not today, nor do they see thee now.<br>Reflecting on thy own instability, who dost thou grieve for them? Reflect<br>with the aid of thy intelligence, and thou wilt understand that verily<br>thou shalt cease to be. Myself, thyself, O king, thy friends, and thy<br>foes, shall, without doubt, cease to be. Indeed, everything will cease to<br>be. Those men that are now of twenty or thirty years of age will, without<br>doubt, all die within the next hundred years. If a man cannot have the<br>heart to give up his vast possessions, he should then endeavour to think<br>his possessions are not his own and by that means seek to do good to<br>himself.[320] Acquisitions that are future should be regarded by one as<br>not one's own. Acquisitions that have disappeared, should also be<br>regarded by one as not one's own. Destiny should be regarded as all<br>powerful. They that think in this strain are said to be possessed of<br>wisdom. Such a habit of looking at things is an attribute of the good.<br>Many persons who are equal or superior to thee in intelligence and<br>exertion, though deprived of wealth, are not only alive but are never<br>ruling kingdoms. They are not, like thee. They do not indulge in grief<br>like thee. Therefore, cease thou to grieve in this way. Art thou not<br>Superior to those men, or at least equal to them in intelligence and<br>exertion?'" The king said, 'I regard the kingdom which I had with all its<br>appendages to have been won by me without any exertion. All-powerful<br>Time, however, O regenerate one, has swept it away. The consequence,<br>however, that I see, of my kingdom having been swept away by Time as by a<br>stream, is that I am obliged to support upon whatever I obtain (by<br>charity).'<br><br>"The sage said, 'Moved by the knowledge of what is true (in life) one<br>should never grieve for either the past or the future. Be thou of such a<br>frame of mind. O prince of Kosala, in respect of every affair that may<br>engage thy attention. Desiring to obtain only that which is obtainable<br>and not that which is unobtainable, do thou enjoy thy present possessions<br>and never grieved for that which is absent. Be thou delighted, O prince<br>of Kosala, with whatever thou succeedest in winning with ease. Even if<br>divested of prosperity, do not grieve for Abut seek to preserve a pure<br>disposition. Only an unfortunate man who is of a foolish understanding,<br>when deprived of former prosperity, censures the supreme Ordainer,<br>without being contented with his present possessions. Such a person<br>regards others, however undeserving, as men blessed with prosperity. For<br>this reason, they that are possessed of malice and vanity and filled with<br>a sense of their own importance, suffer more misery still. Thou however,<br>O king, art not stained by such vices. Endure the prosperity of others<br>although thou art thyself divested of prosperity. They that are possessed<br>of dexterity succeed in enjoying that prosperity which is vested in<br>others.[321] Prosperity leaves the person that hates others. Men<br>possessed of righteous behaviour and wisdom and conversant with the<br>duties of Yoga renounce prosperity and sons and grandsons of their own<br>accord. Others, regarding earthly wealth to be exceedingly unstable and<br>unattainable, dependent as it is upon ceaseless action and effort, are<br>also seen to renounce it.[322] Thou seemest to be possessed of wisdom.<br>Why dost thou then grieve so piteously, desiring things that should not<br>be desired, that are unstable, and that are dependent on others? Thou<br>desirest to enquire after that particular frame of mind (which would<br>enable thee to enjoy felicity notwithstanding the loss of thy<br>possessions). The advice I give thee is to renounce all those objects of<br>desire. Objects that should be avoided appear in the guise of those that<br>should be striven for, while those that should be striven for appear in<br>the guise of objects that should be avoided. Some lose their wealth in<br>the pursuit of wealth. Others regard wealth as the root of infinite<br>happiness, and, therefore pursue it eagerly. Some again, delighted with<br>wealth, think that there is nothing superior to it. In his eager desire<br>for the acquisition of wealth, such a person loses all other objects of<br>life. If, O prince of Kosala, a person loses that wealth which had been<br>earned with difficulty and which had been proportionate to his desires,<br>he then, overcome by the inactivity of despair, gives up all desire of<br>wealth. Some persons of righteous souls and high birth betake themselves<br>to the acquisition of virtue. These renounce every kind of worldly<br>happiness from desire of winning felicity in the other world. Some<br>persons lay down life itself, moved by the desire of acquiring wealth.<br>These do not think that life has any use if dissociated from wealth.<br>Behold their pitiable condition. Behold their foolishness. When life is<br>so short and uncertain, these men, moved by ignorance, set their eyes on<br>wealth. Who is there that would set his heart upon hoarding when<br>destruction is its end, upon life when death is its end, and upon union<br>when separation is its end? sometimes man renounces wealth, and sometimes<br>wealth renounces man. What man possessed of knowledge is there that would<br>feel grieved at the loss of wealth? There are many other persons in the<br>world that lose wealth and friends. Behold, O king, with thy<br>intelligence, and thou wilt understand that the calamities which overtake<br>men are all due to the conduct of men themselves. Do thou, therefore, (as<br>a remedy), restrain thy senses and mind and speech. For, if those become<br>weak and productive of evil there is no man who can keep himself free<br>from temptation of external objects by which he is always surrounded. As<br>no one can form an adequate idea of the past nor can foresee the future,<br>there being many intervals of time and place, a person like thee who is<br>possessed of such wisdom and such prowess, never indulges in grief for<br>union and separation, for good or evil. A person of such mildness of<br>disposition, well-restrained soul, and settled conclusions, and observant<br>of Brahmacharya vows, never indulges in grief and never becomes restless<br>from desire of acquiring or fear of losing anything of small value. It is<br>not fit that such a man should adopt a deceitful life of mendicancy, a<br>life that is sinful and wicked and cruel and worthy of only a wretch<br>among men. Do thou repair to the great forest and lead a life of<br>happiness there, all alone and subsisting upon fruit and roots,<br>restraining speech and soul, and filled with compassion for all<br>creatures. He that cheerfully leads such a life in the forest, with<br>large-tusked elephants for companions, with no human being by his side,<br>and contented with the produce of the wilderness, is said to act after<br>the manner of the wise. A large lake when it becomes turbid, resumes its<br>tranquillity of itself. Similarly, a man of wisdom, when disturbed in<br>such matters, becomes tranquil of himself. I see that a person that has<br>fallen into such a plight as thine may live happily even thus. When thy<br>prosperity is almost impossible to recover, and when thou art without<br>ministers and counsellors, such a course is open to thee. Dost thou hope<br>to reap any benefit by depending upon destiny?'"
