                            "Devasthana said, 'In this connection is cited an old history, viz., the<br>discourse that Vrihaspati, asked by Indra, delivered unto him. Vrihaspati<br>said, 'Contentment is the highest heaven, contentment is the highest<br>bliss. There is nothing higher than contentment. Contentment stands as<br>the highest. When one draws away all his desires like a tortoise drawing<br>in all it limbs, then the natural resplendence of his soul soon manifests<br>itself. When one does not fear any creature, nor any creature is<br>frightened at one, when one conquers one's desire and aversion, then is<br>one said to behold one's soul. When one, indeed, in word and thought,<br>seeks to injure nobody and cherishes no desire, one is said to attain to<br>Brahma. Thus, O son of Kunti, whatever religion is followed by creatures,<br>they obtain corresponding fruits. Awaken thyself by this consideration, O<br>Bharata![67] Some praise Peacefulness, some praise Exertion; some there<br>are that praise Contemplation; and some praise both Peacefulness and<br>Exertion.[68] Some praise sacrifice; others, renunciation. Some praise<br>gifts; others, acceptance. Some, abandoning everything, live in silent<br>meditation. Some praise sovereignty and the cherishing, of subjects,<br>after slaving, cutting and piercing (foes). Some are for passing their<br>days in retirement. Observing all this, the conclusion of the learned is<br>that that religion which consists in not injuring any creature is worthy<br>of the approbation of the righteous. Abstention from injury, truthfulness<br>of speech, justice, compassion, self-restraint, procreation (of<br>offspring) upon one's own wives, amiability, modesty, patience,&#8212;the<br>practice of these is the best of a religions as said by the self-create<br>Manu himself. Therefore, O son of Kunti, do thou observe this religion<br>with care. That Kshatriya, who, conversant with the truths or royal<br>duties, takes sovereignty upon himself, restraining his soul at all<br>times, equally regarding that which is dear and that which is not, and<br>subsisting upon the remains of sacrificial feasts, who is engaged in<br>restraining the wicked and cherishing the righteous, who obliges his<br>subjects to tread in the path of virtue and who himself treads in that<br>path, who at last transmits his crown to his son and betakes himself to<br>the woods, there to live on the products of the wilderness and act<br>according to the ordinances or the Vedas after having cast off all<br>idleness, that Kshatriya who conducts himself thus, conforming in<br>everything to the well-known duties of kings, is sure to obtain excellent<br>fruits in both this world and the next. That final emancipation, of which<br>thou speakest, is exceedingly difficult to obtain, and its pursuit is<br>attended with many impediments. They that adopt such duties and practise<br>charity and ascetic penances, that are possessed of the quality of<br>compassion and are freed from desire and wrath, that are engaged in<br>ruling their subjects with righteousness and fighting for the sake of<br>kine and Brahmanas, attain hereafter to a high end. For the Rudras with<br>the Vasus and the Adityas, O scorcher of foes, and the Sadhyas and hosts<br>of kings adopt this religion. Practising without heedlessness the duties<br>inculcated by that religion, they attain to heaven through those acts of<br>theirs.'"
