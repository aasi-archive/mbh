                            "Vaisampayana said, 'At the time the Parthas entered the city, thousands<br>upon thousands of the citizens came out to behold the sight. The<br>well-adorned squares and streets, with crowd swelling at each moment<br>looked beautiful like the ocean swelling at the rise of the moon. The<br>large mansions that stood on the street-sides, decked with every ornament<br>and full of ladies, seemed to shake, O Bharata, with their weight. With<br>soft and modest voices they uttered the praises of Yudhishthira, of Bhima<br>and Arjuna, and of the two sons of Madri. And they said, 'Worthy of all<br>praise art thou. O blessed princess of Panchala, that waitest by the side<br>of those foremost of men even like Gautami by the side of the (seven)<br>Rishis. Thy acts and vows have borne their fruits, O lady!' In this<br>strain, O monarch, the ladies praised the princess Krishna. In<br>consequence of those praises, O Bharata, and their speeches with one<br>another, and the shouts of joy (uttered by the men' ), the city became<br>filled with a loud uproar. Having passed through the streets with such<br>behaviour as befitted him, Yudhishthira then entered the beautiful palace<br>(of the Kurus) adorned with every ornament. The people belonging to the<br>city and the provinces, approaching the palace, uttered speeches that<br>were agreeable to his ears, 'By good luck, O foremost of kings, thou hast<br>vanquished thy enemies, O slayer of foes! By good luck, thou hast<br>recovered thy kingdom through virtue and prowess. Be, O foremost of<br>kings, our monarch for a hundred years, and protect thy subjects<br>virtuously like Indra protecting the denizens of heaven.' Thus adored at<br>the palace-gate with blessed speeches, and accepting the benedictions<br>uttered by the Brahmanas from every side, the king, graced with victory<br>and the blessings of the people, entered the palace that resembled the<br>mansion of Indra himself, and then descended from his car. Entering the<br>apartments, blessed Yudhishthira approached the household gods and<br>worshipped them with gems and scents and floral wreaths. Possessed of<br>great fame and prosperity, the king came out once more and beheld a<br>number of Brahmanas waiting with auspicious articles in their hands (for<br>pronouncing benedictions on him). Surrounded by those Brahmanas desirous<br>of uttering benedictions on him, the king looked beautiful like the<br>spotless moon in the midst of the stars. Accompanied by his priest<br>Dhaumya and his eldest uncle, the son of Kunti cheerfully worshipped,<br>with due rites, those Brahmanas with (gift of) sweets, gems, and gold in<br>profusion, and kine and robes, O monarch, and with diverse other articles<br>that each desired. Then loud shouts of 'This is a blessed day' arose,<br>filling the entire welkin, O Bharata. Sweet to the ear, that sacred sound<br>was highly gratifying to the friends and well-wishers (of the Pandavas).<br>The king heard that sound uttered by those learned Brahmanas and that was<br>as loud and clear as the sound of a flock of swans. He listened also to<br>the speeches, fraught with melodious words and grave import, of those<br>persons well conversant with the Vedas. Then, O king, the peal of drums<br>and the delightful blare of conchs, indicative of triumph, arose. A<br>little while after when the Brahmanas had become silent, a Rakshasa of<br>the name of Charvaka, who had disguised himself as a Brahmana, addressed<br>the king. He was a friend of Duryodhana and stood therein the garb of a<br>religious mendicant. With a rosary, with a tuft of hair on his head, and<br>with the triple staff in his hand, he stood proudly and fearlessly in the<br>midst of all those Brahmanas that had come there for pronouncing<br>benedictions (upon the king), numbering by thousands, O king, and all of<br>whom were devoted to penances and vows. That wicked wight, desirous of<br>evil unto the high-souled Pandavas and without having consulted those<br>Brahmanas, said these words unto the king.'<br><br>"Charvaka said, 'All these Brahmanas, making me their spokesman, are<br>saying, 'Fie on thee! Thou art a wicked king. Thou art a slayer of<br>kinsmen. What shalt thou gain, O son of Kunti, by having thus<br>exterminated thy race? Having slain also thy superiors and preceptor, it<br>is proper for thee to cast away thy life.' Hearing these words of that<br>wicked Rakshasa the Brahmanas there became deeply agitated. Stung by that<br>speech, they made a loud uproar. And all of them, with king Yudhishthira.<br>O monarch, became speechless from anxiety and shame.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'I bow down to you and beseech you humbly, be<br>gratified with me. It doth not behove you to cry fie on me. I shall soon<br>lay down my life.'[122]<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then all those Brahmanas, O king, loudly said,<br>'These are not our words. Prosperity to thee, O monarch!' Those<br>high-souled persons, conversant with the Vedas, with understanding<br>rendered clear by penances, then penetrated the disguise of the speaker<br>by means of their spiritual sight.' And they said, 'This is the Rakshasa<br>Charvaka, the friend of Duryodhana. Having put on the garb of a religious<br>mendicant, he seeks the good of his friend Duryodhana. We have not, O<br>thou of righteous soul, said anything of the kind. Let this anxiety of<br>thine be dispelled. Let prosperity attend upon thee with thy brothers.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'These Brahmanas then, insensate with rage,<br>uttered the sound Hun. Cleansed of all sins, they censured the sinful<br>Rakshasa and slew him there (with that very sound). Consumed by the<br>energy of those utterers of Brahma, Charvaka fell down dead, like a tree<br>with all its sprouts blasted by the thunder of Indra. Duly worshipped,<br>the Brahmanas went away, having gladdened the king with their<br>benedictions. The royal son of Pandu also, with all his friends, felt<br>great happiness.
