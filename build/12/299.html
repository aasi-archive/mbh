                            "Bhishma said, 'Once again Janaka, the ruler of Mithila, questioned the<br>high-souled Parasara endued with certain knowledge in respect of all<br>duties.'<br><br>"Janaka said, 'What is productive of good? What is the best path (for<br>living creatures)? What is that which being accomplished is never<br>destroyed? What is that spot repairing whither one has not to come back?<br>Tell me all this, O thou of high intelligence!'<br><br>"Parasara said, 'Dissociation (from attachments) is the root of what is<br>good.[1558] Knowledge is the highest path. Penances practised are never<br>destroyed, Gifts also, made to deserving persons, are not lost. When one,<br>breaking the bonds of sin, begins to take pleasure in righteousness, and<br>when one makes that highest of all gifts, viz., the pledge of<br>harmlessness unto all creatures, then does one achieve success. He who<br>gives away thousands of kine and hundreds of horses (to deserving<br>persons), and who gives unto all creatures the pledge of harmlessness,<br>receives in return the pledge of harmlessness from all. One may live in<br>the midst of all kinds of wealth and enjoyment, yet, if blessed with<br>intelligence, one does not live in them: while he that is destitute of<br>intelligence lives wholly in objects of enjoyment that are even<br>unsubstantial.[1559] Sin cannot attach to a man of wisdom even as water<br>cannot drench the leaves of the lotus. Sin adheres more firmly to him who<br>is without attachment even as lac and wood adhere firmly to each other.<br>Sin, which cannot be extinguished except by endurance of its fruits,<br>never abandons the doer. Verily, the doer, when the time comes, has to<br>endure the consequences arising from it.[1560] They, however, that are of<br>cleansed souls and that realise the existence of Brahma, are never<br>afflicted by the fruits of their acts. Heedless in respect of one's<br>senses of knowledge and of action, one that is not conscious of one's<br>wicked acts, and whose heart is attached to both good and bad, becomes<br>afflicted with great fear. One who at all times becomes entirely freed<br>from attachments and who completely subjugates the passion of wrath, is<br>never stained by sin even if he lives in the enjoyment of worldly<br>objects. As a dyke built across a river, if not washed away, causes the<br>waters thereof to swell up, even so the man who, without being attached<br>to objects of enjoyments, creates the dyke of righteousness whose<br>materials consist of the limitations set down in the scriptures, has<br>never to languish. On the other hand, his merits and penances increase.<br>As the pure gem (called Suryakanta) absorbs and attracts to itself, the<br>rays of the Sun, even so, O tiger among kings, does Yoga proceed by help<br>of concentrated attention.[1561] As sesame seeds, in consequence of their<br>repeated intermingling with (fragrant) flowers, become in respect of<br>quality very agreeable, even so the quality of Sattwa arises in men in<br>proportion to the measure of their association with persons of cleansed<br>souls.[1562] When one becomes desirous of dwelling in heaven, one casts<br>off one's spouses and wealth and rank and vehicles and diverse kinds of<br>good acts. Indeed, when one attains to such a frame of mind, one's<br>understanding is said to be dissociated from the objects of the senses.<br>That man (on the other hand) who, with understanding attached to the<br>objects of the senses, becomes blind to what is for his real good, is<br>dragged (to his ruin) by his heart which runs after all worldly objects,<br>like a fish (dragged to its ruin) by the bait of meat. Like unto the body<br>that is made up of different limbs and organs, all mortal creatures exist<br>depending upon one another. They are as destitute of vigour as the pith<br>of the banana plant. (Left to themselves) they sink in the world's ocean<br>like a boat (made of weak materials). There is no fixed time for the<br>acquisition of righteousness. Death waits for no man. When man is<br>constantly running towards the jaws of Death, the accomplishment of<br>righteous acts is proper at all times. Like a blind man who, with<br>attention, is capable of moving about his own house, the man of wisdom,<br>with mind set on Yoga, succeeds in proceeding along the track (he should<br>follow).[1563] It has been said that death arises in consequence of<br>birth. Birth is subject to the sway of death. One unacquainted with the<br>course of the duties of Emancipation revolves like a wheel between birth<br>and death, unable to free oneself from that fate. One who walketh along<br>the track recommended by the understanding earns happiness both here and<br>hereafter. The Diverse are fraught with misery, while the Few are<br>productive of happiness. Fruits represented by the not-Soul are said to<br>constitute the Diverse. Renunciation is (said to constitute the Few and<br>that is) productive of the soul's happiness.[1564] As the lotus stalk<br>quickly leaves the mire attached to it, even so the Soul can speedily<br>cast off the mind.[1565] It is the mind that at first inclines the Soul<br>to Yoga. The latter then merges the former into itself. When the Soul<br>achieves success in Yoga, it then beholds itself uninvested with<br>attributes.[1566] Engaged amid the objects of the senses, one who regards<br>such engagement to be one's employment falleth away from one's true<br>employment in consequence of such devotion to those objects. The soul of<br>the wise man attains, through its righteous acts, to a state of high<br>felicity in heaven, while that of the man who is not possessed of wisdom<br>sinks very low or obtains birth among intermediate creatures. As a liquid<br>substance, if kept in a baked earthen vessel, does not escape therefrom<br>but remains undiminished, after the same manner one's body with which one<br>has undergone austerities enjoys (without rejecting) all objects of<br>enjoyment (up to what are contained in the region of Brahma himself).<br>Verily, that man who enjoys worldly objects can never be emancipated.<br>That man, on the other hand, who casts off such objects (in this world),<br>succeeds in enjoying great happiness hereafter. Like one afflicted with<br>congenital blindness and, therefore, incapable of seeing his way, the<br>sensualist, with soul confined in an opaque case, seems to be surrounded<br>by a mist and fails to see (the true object for which he should strive).<br>As merchants, going across the sea, make profits proportioned to their<br>capital, even so creatures, in this world of mortals, attain to ends<br>according to their respective acts. Like a snake devouring air, Death<br>wanders in this world made up of days and nights in the form of<br>Decrepitude and devours all creatures. A creature, when born, enjoys or<br>endures the fruits of acts done by him in his previous lives. There is<br>nothing agreeable or disagreeable which one enjoys or endures without its<br>being the result of the acts one has done in one's previous lives.<br>Whether lying or proceeding, whether sitting idly engaged in his<br>occupations, in whatever state a man may be, his acts (of past lives)<br>good or bad always approach him. One that has attained to the other shore<br>of the ocean, wishes not to cross the main for returning to the shore<br>whence he had sailed.[1567] As the fisherman, when he wishes, raises with<br>the help of his chord his boat sunk in the waters (of a river or lake),<br>after the same manner the mind, by the aid of Yoga-contemplation, raises<br>Jiva sunk in the world's ocean and unemancipated from consciousness of<br>body.[1568] As all rivers running towards the ocean, unite themselves<br>with it, even so the mind, when engaged in Yoga, becomes united with<br>primal Prakriti.[1569] Men whose minds become bound by diverse chains of<br>affection, and who are engulfed in ignorance, meet with destruction like<br>houses of sand in water.[1570] That embodied creature who regards his<br>body as only a house and purity (both external and internal) as its<br>sacred water, and who walks along the path of the understanding, succeeds<br>in attaining to happiness both here and hereafter.[1571] The Diverse are<br>productive of misery; while the Few are productive of happiness. The<br>Diverse are the fruits represented by the not-Soul. Renunciation (which<br>is identical with Few) is productive of the soul's benefit.[1572] One's<br>friends who spring up from one's determination, and one's kinsmen whose<br>attachment is due to (selfish) reasons, one's spouses and sons and<br>servants, only devour one's wealth. Neither the mother, nor the father,<br>can confer the slightest benefit upon one in the next world. Gifts<br>constitute the diet upon which one can subsist. Indeed, one must have to<br>enjoy the fruits of one's own acts.[1573] The mother, the son, the sire,<br>the brother, the wife, and friends, are like lines traced with gold by<br>the side of gold itself.[1574] All acts, good and bad, done in past lives<br>come to the doer. Knowing that everything one enjoys or endures at<br>present is the result of the acts of past lives, the soul urges the<br>understanding on different directions (so that it may act in such a way<br>as to avoid all unpleasant fruits). Relying on earnest endeavour, and<br>equipped with proper aids, he who sets himself to accomplish his tasks<br>never meets with failure. As the rays of light never abandon the Sun,<br>even so prosperity never abandons one who is endued with undoubting<br>faith. That act which a man of stainless soul does with faith and<br>earnestness, with the aid of proper means, without pride, and with<br>intelligence, becomes never lost. A creature obtains from the very time<br>of his abode in the mother's womb all his own acts good and bad that were<br>achieved by him in his past lives. Death, which is irresistible, aided by<br>Time which brings about the destruction of life, leads all creatures to<br>their end like wind scattering the dust of sawed timber.[1575] Through<br>acts good and bad performed by himself in his past lives, man obtains<br>gold and animals and spouses, and children, and honour of birth, and<br>possessions of value, and his entire affluence.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed conformably to the truth by the sage,<br>Janaka, that foremost of righteous persons, O king, heard everything the<br>Rishi said and obtained great happiness from it.'"
