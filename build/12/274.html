                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast said, O grandsire, the Emancipation is to<br>be won by means and not otherwise. I desire to hear duly what those means<br>are.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O thou of great wisdom, this enquiry that thou hast<br>addressed to me and that is connected with a subtle topic, is really<br>worthy of thee, since thou, O sinless one, always seekest to accomplish<br>all thy objects by the application of means. That state of mind which is<br>present when one sets oneself to make an earthen jar for one's use,<br>disappears after the jar has been completed. After the same manner, that<br>cause which urges persons who regard virtue as the root of advancement<br>and prosperity ceases to operate with them that seek to achieve<br>Emancipation.[1300] That path which leads to the Eastern Ocean is not the<br>path by which one can go to the Western Ocean. There is only one path<br>that leads to Emancipation. (It is not identical with any of those that<br>lead to arty other object of acquisition). Listen to me as I discourse on<br>it to thee in detail. One should, by practising forgiveness, exterminate<br>wrath, and by abandoning&#8212;all purposes, root out desire. By practising<br>the quality of Sattwa[1301] one should conquer sleep. By heedfulness one<br>should keep off fear, and by contemplation of the Soul one should conquer<br>breath.[1302] Desire, aversion, and lust, one should dispel by patience;<br>error, ignorance, and doubt, by study of truth. By pursuit after<br>knowledge one should avoid insouciance and inquiry after things of no<br>interest.[1303] By frugal and easily digestible fare one should drive off<br>all disorders and diseases. By contentment one should dispel greed and<br>stupefaction of judgment, and all worldly concerns should be avoided by a<br>knowledge of the truth.[1304] By practising benevolence one should<br>conquer iniquity, and by regard for all creatures one should acquire<br>virtue. One should avoid expectation by the reflection that it is<br>concerned with the future; and one should cast off wealth by abandoning<br>desire itself. The man of intelligence should abandon affection by<br>recollecting that everything (here) is transitory. He should subdue<br>hunger by practising Yoga. By practising benevolence one should keep off<br>all ideas of self-importance, and drive off all sorts of craving by<br>adopting contentment. By exertion one should subdue procrastination, and<br>by certainty all kinds of doubt, by taciturnity, loquaciousness, and by<br>courage, every kind of fear.[1305] Speech and mind are to be subdued by<br>the Understanding, and the Understanding, in its turn, is to be kept<br>under control by the eye of knowledge. Knowledge, again, is to be<br>controlled by acquaintance with the Soul, and finally the Soul is to be<br>controlled by the Soul.[1306] This last is attainable by those that are<br>of pure-acts and endued with tranquillity of soul,[1307] the means being<br>the subjugation of those five impediments of Yoga of which the learned<br>speak. By casting off desire and wrath and covetousness and fear and<br>sleep, one should, restraining speech, practise what is favourable to<br>Yoga, viz., contemplation, study, gift, truth, modesty, candour,<br>forgiveness, purity of heart, purity in respect of food, and the<br>subjugation of the senses. By these one's energy is increased, sins are<br>dispelled, wishes crowned with fruition, and knowledge (of diverse kinds)<br>gained. When one becomes cleansed of one's sins and possessed of energy<br>and frugal of fare and the master of one's senses, one then, having<br>conquered both desire and wrath, seeks to attain to Brahma. The avoidance<br>of ignorance (by listening to and studying the scriptures), the absence<br>of attachment (in consequence of Renunciation) freedom from desire and<br>wrath (by adoption of contentment and forgiveness), the puissance that is<br>won by Yoga, the absence of pride and haughtiness, freedom from anxiety<br>(by subjugation of every kind of fear), absence of attachment of anything<br>like home and family,&#8212;these constitute the path of Emancipation. That<br>path is delightful, stainless, and pure. Similarly, the restraining of<br>speech, of body, and of mind, when practised from the absence of desire,<br>constitutes also the path of Emancipation.'"[1308]
