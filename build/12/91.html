                            "Utathya said, 'If the deity of the clouds pours rain seasonably and the<br>king acts virtuously, the prosperity that ensues maintain the subjects in<br>felicity. That washerman who does not know how to wash away the filth of<br>cloth without taking away its dye, is very unskilful in his profession.<br>That person among Brahmanas or Kshatriyas or Vaisyas who, having fallen<br>away from the proper duties of his order, has become a Sudra, is truly to<br>be compared to such a washerman. Menial service attaches to the Sudra;<br>agriculture to the Vaisya; the science of chastisement to the Kshatriya,<br>and Brahmacharya, penances, mantras, and truth, attach, to the Brahmana.<br>That Kshatriya who knows how to correct the faults of behaviour of the<br>other orders and to wash them clean like a washerman is really their<br>father and deserve to be their king. The respective ages called Krita,<br>Treta, Dwapara and Kali, O bull of Bharata's race, are all dependent on<br>the conduct of the king. It is the king who constitutes  the age.[269]<br>The four orders, the Vedas and the duties in respect of the four modes of<br>life, all become confused and weakened when the king becomes heedless.<br>The three kinds of Fire, the three Vedas, and sacrifices with Dakshina,<br>all become lost when the king becomes heedless. The king is the creator<br>of all creatures, and the king is their destroyer. That king who is of<br>righteous soul is regarded as the creator, while he that is sinful is<br>regarded as the destroyer. The king's wives, sons, kinsmen, and friends,<br>all become unhappy and grieve when the king becomes heedless. Elephants<br>and steeds and kine and camels and mules and asses and other animals all<br>lose their vigour when the king becomes unrighteous. It is said, O<br>Mandhatri, that the Creator created Power (represented by the king) for<br>the object of protecting Weakness. Weakness is, indeed, a great being,<br>for everything depends upon it.[270] All creatures worship the king. All<br>creatures are the children of the king. If, therefore, O monarch, the<br>king becomes unrighteous, all creatures come to grief. The eyes of the<br>weak, of the Muni, and of the snake of virulent poison, should be<br>regarded as unbearable. Do not, therefore, come into (hostile) contact<br>with the weak. Thou shouldst regard the weak as always subject to<br>humiliation. Take care that the eyes of the weak do not burn thee with<br>thy kinsmen. In a race scorched by the eyes of the weak, no children take<br>birth. Such eyes burn the race to its very roots. Do not, therefore, come<br>into (hostile) contact with the weak. Weakness is more powerful than even<br>the greatest Power, for that Power which is scorched by Weakness becomes<br>totally exterminated. If a person, who has been humiliated or struck,<br>fails, while shrieking for assistance, to obtain a protector, divine<br>chastisement overtakes the king and brings about his destruction. Do not,<br>O sire, while in enjoyment of Power, take wealth from those that are<br>Weak. Take care that that the eyes of the Weak do not burn thee like a<br>blazing fire. The tears shed by weeping men afflicted with falsehood slay<br>the children and animals of those that have uttered those falsehoods.<br>Like a cow a sinful act perpetrated does not produce immediate<br>fruits.[271] If the fruit is not seen in the perpetrator himself, it is<br>seen in his son or in his son's son, or daughter's son. When a weak<br>person fails to find a rescuer, the great rod of divine chastisement<br>falls (upon the king). When all subjects of a king (are obliged by<br>distress to) live like Brahmanas, by mendicancy, such mendicancy brings<br>destruction upon the king. When all the officers of the king posted in<br>the provinces unite together and act with injustice, the king is then<br>said to bring about a state of unmixed evil upon his kingdom. When the<br>officers of the king extort wealth, by unjust means or acting from lust<br>or avarice, from persons piteously soliciting mercy, a great destruction<br>then is sure to overtake the king. A mighty tree, first starting into<br>life, grows into large proportions. Numerous creatures then come and seek<br>its shelter. When, however, it is cut down or consumed in a<br>conflagration, those that, had recourse to it for shelter all become<br>homeless.[272] When the residents of a kingdom perform acts of<br>righteousness and all religious rites, and applaud the good qualities of<br>the king, the latter reaps an accession of affluence. When, on the other<br>hand, the residents, moved by ignorance, abandon righteousness and act<br>unrighteously, the king becomes overtaken by misery. When sinful men<br>whose acts are known are allowed to move among the righteous (without<br>being punished for their misdeeds), Kali then overtakes the rulers of<br>those realms.[273] When the king causes chastisement to overtake all<br>wicked people, his kingdom thrives in prosperity. The kingdom of that<br>king certainly thrives who pays proper honours to his ministers and<br>employs them in measures of policy and in battles. Such a ruler enjoys<br>the wide earth for ever. That king who duly honours all good acts and<br>good speeches succeeds in earning great merit. The enjoyment of good<br>things after sharing them with others, paying proper honours to the<br>ministers, and subjugation or persons intoxicated with strength, are said<br>to constitute the great duty of a king. Protecting all men by words,<br>body, and deeds, and never forgiving his son himself (if he has<br>offended), constitute the great duty of the king. The maintenance of<br>those that are weak by sharing with them the things he has, and thereby<br>increasing their strength constitute the duty of the king. Protection of<br>the kingdom, extermination of robbers, and conquering in battle,<br>constitute the duty of the king. Never to forgive a person however dear,<br>if he has committed an offence by act or word, constitutes the duty of<br>the king. Protecting those that solicit shelter, as he would protect his<br>own children, and never depriving one of the honours to which he is<br>entitled constitute the duty of the king.[274] Adoring the deities, with<br>a devoted heart, in sacrifices completed by presents, and subduing lust<br>and envy, constitute the duty of the king. Wiping the tears of the<br>distressed, the helpless, and the old, and inspiring them with joy,<br>constitute the duty of the king. Aggrandising friends, weakening foes,<br>and honouring the good, constitute the duty of the king. Cheerfully<br>observing the obligations of truth, always making gifts of land,<br>entertaining guests, and supporting dependents, constitute the duty of<br>the king. That king who favours those that deserve favours and chastises<br>those that deserve chastisement earns great merit both here and<br>hereafter. The king is Yama himself. He is, O Mandhatri, the god<br>(incarnate) unto all that are righteous. By subduing his senses he<br>succeeds in acquiring great affluence. By not subduing them he incurs<br>sin.[275] Paying proper honours unto Ritwijas and priests and preceptors,<br>and doing good offices unto them constitute the duty of the king. Yama<br>governs all creatures without observing distinctions. The king should<br>imitate him in his behaviour by restraining all his subjects duly. The<br>king is said to resemble the Thousand-eyed (Indra) in every respect.<br>That, O bull among men, should be regarded as righteousness which is<br>regarded as such by him. Thou shouldst, without being heedless, cultivate<br>forgiveness, intelligence, patience, and the, love of all creatures. Thou<br>shouldst also ascertain the strength and weakness of all men and learn to<br>distinguish between right and wrong. Thou shouldst conduct thyself with<br>propriety towards all creatures, make gifts, and utter agreeable and<br>sweet words. Thou shouldst maintain the residents of thy city and the<br>provinces in happiness. A king who is not clever, never succeeds in<br>protecting his subjects. Sovereignty, O sire, is a very happy burthen to<br>bear. Only that king who is possessed of wisdom and courage, and who is<br>conversant with the science of chastisement, can protect a kingdom. He,<br>on the other hand, who is without energy and intelligence, and who is not<br>versed in the great science, is incompetent to bear the burthen of<br>sovereignty. Aided by ministers of handsome features and good birth,<br>clever in business, devoted to their master, and possessed of great<br>learning, thou shouldst examine the hearts and acts of all men including<br>the very ascetics in the forests. Conducting thyself thus, thou wilt be<br>able to learn the duties of all orders of men. That will aid thee in<br>observing thy own duties, whether when thou art in thy country or when<br>thou repairest to other realms. Amongst these three objects, viz.,<br>Virtue, Profit, and Pleasure, Virtue is the foremost. He that is of<br>virtuous soul obtains great happiness both here and hereafter. If men be<br>treated with honour, they can abandon (for the sake of the honour thou<br>mayst give them) their very wives and sons. By attaching good men to<br>himself (by doing good offices unto them), by gifts, sweet words,<br>heedfulness and purity of behaviour, a king may win great prosperity. Do<br>not, therefore, O Mandhatri, be heedless to these qualities and acts. The<br>king should never be heedless in looking after his own laches, as also<br>after those of his foes. He should act in such a way that his foes may<br>not be able to detect his laches, and he should himself assail them when<br>theirs are visible. This is the way in which Vasava, and Yama, and<br>Varuna, and all the great royal sages have acted. Do thou observe the<br>same conduct. Do thou, O great king, adopt this behaviour which was<br>followed by those royal sages. Do thou soon, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>adept this heavenly road. The gods, the Rishis, the Pitris, and the<br>Gandharvas, possessed of great energy, sing the praises, both here and<br>hereafter, of that king whose conduct is righteous.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by Utathya, O Bharata, Mandhatri,<br>unhesitatingly did as he was directed, and became the sole lord of the<br>wide earth. Do thou also, O king, act righteously like Mandhatri. Thou<br>wilt then, after ruling the earth, obtain an abode in heaven.'"
