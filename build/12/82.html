                            "Bhishma said, 'This that I have told thee constitutes the first means.<br>Listen now, O Bharata to the second means. That man who seeks to advance<br>the interests of the king should always be protected by the king. If a<br>person, O Yudhishthira, that is paid or unpaid, comes to thee for telling<br>thee of the damage done to thy treasury when its resources are being<br>embezzled by a minister, thou shouldst grant him an audience in private<br>and protect him also from the (impeached) minister. The ministers guilty<br>of peculation seek, O Bharata, to slay such informants. They who plunder<br>the royal treasury combine together for opposing the person who seeks to<br>protect it, and if the latter be left unprotected, he is sure to be<br>ruined. In this connection also an old story is cited of what the sage<br>Kalakavrikshiya had said unto the king of Kosala. It hath been heard by<br>us that once on a time the sage Kalakavrikshiya came to Kshemadarsin who<br>had ascended the throne of the kingdom of Kosala. Desirous of examining<br>the conduct of all the officers of Kshemadarsin, the sage, with a crow<br>kept within a cage in his hand, repeatedly travelled through every part<br>of that king's dominions. And he spoke unto all the men and said, 'Study,<br>ye the corvine science. The crows tell me the present, the past, and the<br>future.' Proclaiming this in the kingdom, the sage, accompanied by a<br>large number of men, began to observe the misdeeds of all the officers of<br>the king. Having ascertained all the affairs in respect of that kingdom,<br>and having learnt that all the officers appointed by the king were guilty<br>of malversation, the sage, with his crow, came to see the king. Of rigid<br>vows, he said unto the king, 'I know everything (about thy kingdom).'<br>Arrived at the presence of the king, he said unto his minister adorned<br>with the insignia of his office that he had been informed by his crow<br>that the minister had done such a misdeed in such a place, and that such<br>and such persons know that he had plundered the royal treasury. 'My crow<br>tells me this. Admit or prove the falsehood of the accusation quickly.'<br>The sage then proclaimed the names of other officers who had similarly<br>been guilty of embezzlement, adding, 'My crow never says anything that is<br>false.' Thus accused and injured by the sage, all the officers of the<br>king, O thou of Kuru's race, (united together and) pierced his crow,<br>while the sage slept, at night. Beholding his crow pierced with a shaft<br>within the cage, the regenerate Rishi, repairing to Kshemadarsin in the<br>morning said unto him, 'O king, I seek thy protection. Thou art<br>all-powerful and thou art the master of the lives and wealth of all. If I<br>receive thy command I can then say what is for thy good. Grieved on<br>account of thee whom I regard as a friend have come to thee, impelled by<br>my devotion and ready to serve thee with my whole heart. Thou art being<br>robbed of thy wealth, I have come to thee for disclosing it without<br>showing any consideration for the robbers. Like a driver that urges a<br>good steed, I have come hither for awakening thee whom I regard as a<br>friend. A friend who is alive to his own interests and desirous of his<br>own prosperity and aggrandisement, should forgive a friend that intrudes<br>himself forcibly, impelled by devotion and wrath, for doing what is<br>beneficial.' The king replied unto him, saying, 'Why should I not bear<br>anything thou wilt say, since I am not blind to what is for my good? I<br>grant thee permission, O regenerate one! Tell me what thou pleasest, I<br>shall certainly obey the instructions thou wilt give me, O Brahman,'<br><br>"The sage said, 'Ascertaining the merits and faults of thy servants, as<br>also the: dangers thou incurrest at their hands, I have come to thee,<br>impelled by my devotion, for representing everything to thee. The<br>teachers (of mankind) have of old declared what the curses are, O king,<br>of those that serve others. The lot of those that serve the king is very<br>painful and wretched. He who has any connection with kings is to have<br>connection with snakes of virulent poison. Kings have many friends as<br>also many enemies. They that serve kings have to fear all of them. Every<br>moment, again, they have fear from the king himself, O monarch. A person<br>serving the king cannot (with impunity) be guilty of heedlessness in<br>doing the king's work. Indeed, a servant who desires to win prosperity<br>should never display heedlessness in the discharge of his duties. His<br>heedlessness may move the king to wrath, and such wrath may bring down<br>destruction (on the servant). Carefully learning how to behave himself,<br>one should sit in the presence of the king as he should in the presence<br>of a blazing fire. Prepared to lay down life itself at every moment, one<br>should serve the king attentively, for the king is all-powerful and<br>master of the lives and the wealth of all, and therefore, like unto a<br>snake of virulent poison. He should always fear to indulge in evil<br>speeches before the king, or to sit cheerlessly or in irreverent<br>postures, or to wait in attitudes of disrespect or to walk disdainfully<br>or display insolent gestures and disrespectful motions of the limbs. If<br>the king becomes gratified, he can shower prosperity like god. If he<br>becomes enraged, he can consume to the very roots like a blazing fire.<br>This, O king, was said by Yama. Its truth is seen in the affairs of the<br>world. I shall now (acting according to these precepts) do that which<br>would enhance thy prosperity. Friends like ourselves can give unto<br>friends like thee the aid of their intelligence in seasons of peril. This<br>crow of mine, O king, has been slain for doing thy business. I cannot,<br>however, blame thee for this. Thou art not loved by those (that have<br>slain this bird). Ascertain who are thy friends and who thy foes. Do<br>everything thyself without surrendering thy intelligence to others. They<br>who are on thy establishment are all peculators. They do not desire the<br>good of thy subjects. I have incurred their hostility. Conspiring with<br>those servants that have constant access to thee they covet the kingdom<br>after thee by compassing thy destruction. Their plans, however, do not<br>succeed in consequence of unforeseen circumstances. Through fear of those<br>men, O king, I shall leave this kingdom for some other asylum. I have no<br>worldly desire, yet those persons of deceitful intentions have shot this<br>shaft at my crow, and have, O lord, despatched the bird to Yama's abode.<br>I have seen this, O king, with eyes whose vision has been improved by<br>penances. With the assistance of this single crow I have crossed this<br>kingdom of thine that is like a river abounding with alligators and<br>sharks and crocodiles and whales. Indeed, with the assistance of that<br>bird, I have passed through thy dominions like unto a Himalayan valley,<br>impenetrable and inaccessible in consequence of trunks of (fallen) trees<br>and scattered rocks and thorny shrubs and lions and tigers and other<br>beasts of prey. The learned say that a region inaccessible in consequence<br>of gloom can be passed through with the aid of a light, and a river that<br>is unfordable can be crossed by means of a boat. No means, however, exist<br>for penetrating or passing through the labyrinth of kingly affairs. Thy<br>kingdom is like an inaccessible forest enveloped with gloom. Thou (that<br>art the lord of it) canst not trust it. How then can I? Good and evil are<br>regarded here in the same light. Residence here cannot, therefore, be<br>safe. Here a person of righteous deeds meets with death, while one of<br>unrighteous deeds incurs no danger. According to the requirements of<br>justice, a person of unrighteous deeds should be slain but never one who<br>is righteous in his acts. It is not proper, therefore, for one to stay in<br>this kingdom long. A man of sense should leave this country soon. There<br>is a river, O king, of the name of Sita. Boats sink in it. This thy<br>kingdom is like that river. An all-destructive net seems to have been<br>cast around it. Thou art like the fall that awaits collectors of honey,<br>or like attractive food containing poison. Thy nature now resembles that<br>of dishonest men and not that of the good. Thou art like a pit, O king,<br>abounding with snakes of virulent poison. Thou resemblest, O king, a<br>river full of sweet water but exceedingly difficult of access, With steep<br>banks overgrown with Kariras and thorny canes. Thou art like a swan in<br>the midst of dogs, vultures and jackals. Grassy parasites, deriving their<br>sustenance from a mighty tree, swell into luxuriant growth, and at last<br>covering the tree itself overshadow it completely. A forest conflagration<br>sets in, and catching those grassy plants first, consumes the lordly tree<br>with them. Thy ministers, O king, resemble those grassy parasites of<br>which I speak. Do thou check and correct them. They have been nourished<br>by thee. But conspiring against thee, they are destroying thy prosperity.<br>Concealing (from thee) the faults of thy servants, I am living in thy<br>abode in constant dread of danger, even like a person living in a room<br>with a snake within it or like the lover of a hero's wife. My object is<br>to ascertain the behaviour of the king who is my fellow-lodger. I wish to<br>know whether the king has his passions under control, whether his<br>servants are obedient to him, whether he is loved by them, and whether he<br>loves his subjects. For the object of ascertaining all these points, O<br>best of kings, I have come to thee. Like food to a hungry person, thou<br>hast become dear to me. I dislike thy ministers, however, as a person<br>whose thirst has been slaked dislikes drink. They have found fault with<br>me because I seek thy good. I have no doubt that there is no other cause<br>for that hostility of theirs to me. I do not cherish any hostile<br>intentions towards them. I am engaged in only marking their faults. As<br>one should fear a wounded snake, every one should fear a foe of wicked<br>heart!'[243]<br><br>"The king said, 'Reside in my palace, O Brahmana! I shall always treat<br>thee with respect and honour, and always worship thee. They that will<br>dislike thee shall not dwell with me. Do thou thyself do what should be<br>done next unto those persons (of whom thou hast spoken). Do thou see, O<br>holy one, that the rod of chastisement is wielded properly and that<br>everything is done well in my kingdom. Reflecting upon everything, do<br>thou guide me in such a way that I may obtain prosperity.'<br><br>"The sage said, 'Shutting thy eyes in the first instance to this offence<br>of theirs (viz., the slaughter of the crow), do thou weaken them one by<br>one. Prove their faults then and strike them one after another. When many<br>persons become guilty of the same offence, they can, by acting together,<br>soften the very points of thorns. Lest thy ministers (being suspected,<br>act against thee and) disclose thy secret counsels, I advise thee to<br>proceed with such caution. As regards ourselves, we are Brahmanas,<br>naturally compassionate and unwilling to give pain to any one. We desire<br>thy good as also the good of others, even as we wish the good of<br>ourselves. I speak of myself, O king! I am thy friend. I am known as the<br>sage Kalakavrikshiya. I always adhere to truth. Thy sire regarded me<br>lovingly as his friend. When distress overtook this kingdom during the<br>region of thy sire, O king, I performed many penances (for driving it<br>off), abandoning every other business. From my affection for thee I say<br>this unto thee so that thou mayst not again commit the fault (of reposing<br>confidence on undeserving persons). Thou hast obtained a kingdom without<br>trouble. Reflect upon everything connected with its weal and woe. Thou<br>hast ministers in thy kingdom. But why, O king, shouldst thou be guilty<br>of heedlessness?' After this, the king of Kosala took a minister from the<br>Kshatriya order, and appointed that bull among Brahmanas (viz., the sage<br>Kalakavrikshiya) as his Purohita. After these changes had been effected,<br>the king of Kosala subjugated the whole earth and acquired great fame.<br>The sage Kalakavrikshiya worshipped the gods in many grand sacrifices<br>performed for the king. Having listened to his beneficial counsels, the<br>king of Kosala conquered the whole earth and conducted himself in every<br>respect as the sage directed.'"
