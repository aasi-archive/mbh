                            "Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old story that follows.<br>There was among the Angas a king of great splendour, called Vasuhoma.<br>That king was always engaged in acts of piety, and accompanied by his<br>spouse he always practiced the most rigid penances. He repaired to the<br>spot called Munjaprishtha held in high esteem by the Pitris and the<br>celestial Rishis. There, on that peak of Himavat, near the golden<br>mountains of Merit, (the great Brahmana here) Rama, sitting under the<br>shade of a well-known banian, had tied his matted locks together.[367]<br>From that time, O monarch, the spot, which is a favourite haunt of Rudra,<br>came to be called Munjaprishtha by Rishis of rigid vows. King Vasuhoma,<br>residing in that spot, acquired many pious attributes and, having gained<br>the esteem of the Brahmanas, came to be regarded as a celestial Rishi in<br>holiness. One day, that crusher of foes, that friend of Sakra, viz., king<br>Mandhatri of great soul, came to Vasuhoma on his mountain retreat.<br>Arrived there, Mandhatri, beholding king Vasuhoma of austere penances<br>stood before the latter in an attitude of humility. Vasuhoma offered unto<br>his guest water to wash his feet, and the Arghya consisting of the usual<br>articles, and enquired of him about the well-being or otherwise of his<br>kingdom consisting of seven limbs. After this, Vasuhoma addressed his<br>royal guest who faithfully followed the practices of the righteous men of<br>old, saying, 'What, O king, shall I do for thee?' Thus addressed, O<br>delighter of the Kurus, Mandhatri, that best of kings, highly gratified,<br>answered Vasuhoma of great wisdom seated at his ease, in the following<br>words.'<br><br>"Mandhatri said, 'Thou hast, O king, studied all the doctrines of<br>Vrihaspati. O best of men, the doctrines laid down by Usanas also are<br>known to thee. I desire to know what is the origin of Chastisement. What<br>was awake before Chastisement? What also is said to be its end? How came<br>Chastisement to depend upon the Kshatriya? Tell me all this. O thou of<br>great wisdom! I come to thee as a disciple ready to give thee the<br>tutorial fee.'[368]<br><br>"Vasuhoma said, 'Listen, O king, as to how Chastisement, that upholder of<br>the world, arose. The soul of righteousness, it is eternal, and was<br>created for maintaining the due government of all creatures. It hath been<br>heard by us that once upon a time, the Grandsire of all the worlds, viz.,<br>the divine Brahman desiring to perform a sacrifice, failed to find a<br>priest possessed of qualifications like himself. For this reason he<br>conceived in his brain and held the foetus there for many long years.<br>After a thousand years had passed away, the great god sneezed. In that<br>act, the foetus fell from his head. The divine being, O chastiser of<br>foes, that thus took birth from Brahman was called by the name of Kshupa.<br>Possessed of great powers, he became a lord of creatures. That Kshupa<br>became the priest, O king, in the sacrifice of the high-souled Grandsire.<br>Upon the commencement of that sacrifice, of Brahman, O best of kings.<br>Chastisement disappeared in consequence of the visible form that the<br>Grandsire was then obliged to assume.[369] Chastisement having<br>disappeared, a great confusion set in among all creatures. There was no<br>longer any distinction between what should be done and what should not.<br>All distinction, again, between clean and unclean food ceased. Men ceased<br>to distinguish between what drink was allowable and what drink was<br>otherwise. All creatures began to injure one another. There were no<br>restraints in the matter of the union of the sexes. All idea of property<br>ceased. All creatures began to rob, and snatching meat from one another.<br>The strong began to slay the weak. Nobody cherished the slightest<br>consideration for his neighbour. The Grandsire then, having worshipped<br>the divine and eternal Vishnu, addressed that great boon-giving god,<br>saying, 'It behoveth thee, O Kesava, to show mercy on the present<br>occasion. Let it be so ordained by thee that the confusion that has<br>occurred may disappear.' Thus addressed, that foremost of deities, armed<br>with an enormous Sula,[370] having reflected long, created his ownself<br>into the form of Chastisement. From that form, having Righteousness for<br>its legs, the goddess Saraswati created Danda-niti (Science of<br>Chastisement) which very soon became celebrated over the world. After<br>this the great god armed with the enormous Sula, having again reflected<br>for some time, appointed a few among the gods as the lords or rulers of<br>their respective classes. It was then that he made the divine Indra of a<br>thousand eyes the ruler of the deities. Yama the son of Vivaswat was made<br>the lord of the Pitris. Kuvera was made the lord of treasures and of all<br>the Rakshasas. Meru was made the king of the mountains, and Ocean was<br>made the lord of the rivers. The puissant Varuna was installed into the<br>sovereignty of the waters and the Asuras. Death was made the lord of life<br>and all living things, and Fire was appointed as the lord of all things<br>possessed of energy. The puissant Isana the high-souled and eternal<br>Mahadeva, of three eyes, was made the lord of the Rudras. Vasishtha was<br>made the lord of the Brahmanas, and Jatavedas was made the chief of the<br>Vasus. Surya was made the lord of all luminous bodies, and Chandramas was<br>made the king of Stars and constellations. Ansumat was made the lord of<br>all herbs, and the puissant and foremost of deities, viz., Kumara or<br>Skanda, of twelve arms, was made the chief of all the spirits and ghostly<br>beings (that wait upon Mahadeva). Time, possessing the seeds of both<br>destruction and growth, was made the sovereign of all creatures as also<br>of the four portions of Death (viz., weapons, diseases, Yama, and acts)<br>and lastly of grief and joy. The Srutis declare that the supreme god<br>Mahadeva, that lord of lords, O king, armed with Sula, is the chief of<br>the Rudras. The rod of chastisement was given to Brahmana's son of<br>subsequent birth, viz., Kshupa, that lord of all creatures and the<br>foremost one of all virtuous persons. Upon the completion of that<br>sacrifice according to due rites, Mahadeva, after doing proper reverence<br>made over Chastisement, that protector of Righteousness, unto<br>Vishnu.[371] Vishnu gave it to Angiras; and Angiras, that foremost of<br>ascetics, made it over to Indra and Marichi. Marichi gave it to Bhrigu.<br>Bhrigu gave that rod intended for the protection of righteousness, unto<br>all the Rishis. The Rishis gave it unto the Regents of the world, and the<br>Regents made it over again to Kshupa. Kshupa then made it over to Manu<br>the son of Surya. The deity of Sraddhas (viz., Manu), gave it unto his<br>sons for the sake of true righteousness and wealth. Chastisement should<br>be inflicted with discrimination, guided by righteousness and not by<br>caprice. It is intended for restraining the wicked. Fines and forfeitures<br>are intended for striking alarm, and not for filling the king's treasury.<br>The maiming of one's body or the infliction of death should not proceed<br>from trivial causes. The infliction of physical pain by diverse means,<br>hurling from tops of mountains, and banishment also, should not proceed<br>from similar causes. Surya's son Manu gave the rod of chastisement (to<br>his sons) for the protection of the world. Chastisement, in the hands of<br>successive holders, remains awake, protecting all creatures. At the top<br>of the scale, the divine Indra is awake (with the rod of chastisement);<br>after him, Agni of blazing flames; after him, Varuna; after Varuna,<br>Prajapati; after Prajapati, Righteousness whose essence consists of<br>restraint,[372] after Righteousness the son of Brahman, viz., the eternal<br>Law; after Law, Energy is awake, employed in the act of protection; after<br>Energy, the herbs (offered in sacrifices for supporting the gods and used<br>as food and medicines); after the herbs, the mountains; after the<br>mountains, all kinds of juices and their attributes; after these, the<br>goddess Niriti; after Niriti, the planets and the luminous bodies in<br>heaven; after these, the Vedas; after the Vedas, the puissant form of<br>Vishnu with equine head; after him, the almighty and eternal Grandsire,<br>viz., Brahman; after the Grandsire, the divine and blessed Mahadeva;<br>after Mahadeva, the Viswedevas; after them, the great Rishis; after the<br>Rishis the divine Soma; after Soma, the deities who are all eternal;<br>after the deities, know that the Brahmanas are awake. After the<br>Brahmanas, the Kshatriyas are righteously protecting all creatures. The<br>eternal universe, consisting of mobile and immobile creatures, is kept<br>awake by the Kshatriyas. Creatures are kept awake in this world, and<br>Chastisement is awake among them. Possessed of splendour resembling that<br>of the Grandsire himself, Chastisement keeps together and upholds<br>everything.[373] Time, O Bharata, is always awake, in the beginning, the<br>middle, and the end. The master of all the worlds, the lord of all<br>creatures, the puissant and blessed Mahadeva, the god of gods, is always<br>awake. He is called by these names also, viz., Kapardin, Sankara, Rudra,<br>Bhava, Sthanu and the lord of Uma. Thus Chastisement also keeps awake in<br>the beginning, the middle, and the end. A virtuous king should rule<br>properly, guided by Chastisement.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'That person who listens to this teaching of<br>Vasuhoma, and having listened to it conducts himself according to its<br>tenure, is sure to obtain the fruition of all his wishes. I have now, O<br>bull among men, told thee everything as to who Chastisement is, that<br>restrainer of the universe which is governed by righteousness.'"
