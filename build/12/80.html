                            "Yudhishthira said, 'The most trifling act, O grandsire, cannot be<br>accomplished by any man if unaided. What then need be said of the king<br>(who has to govern a kingdom)? What should be the behaviour and what the<br>acts of the king's minister? Upon whom should the king repose confidence<br>and upon whom should he not?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Kings, O monarch, have four kinds of friends. They are he<br>that has the same object, he that is devoted, he that is related by<br>birth, and he that has been won over (by gifts and kindness). A person of<br>righteous soul, who would serve one and not both sides, is the fifth in<br>the enumeration of the king's friends. Such a person adopts that side on<br>which righteousness is, and accordingly acts righteously. With respect to<br>such a person, the king should never disclose such purposes of his as<br>would not enlist his sympathy. Kings desirous of success are obliged to<br>adopt both kinds of paths, righteous and unrighteous. Of the four kinds<br>of friends, the second and the third are superior, while the first and<br>the fourth should ever be regarded with suspicion. In view, however, of<br>those acts which the king should do in person, he should always regard<br>with suspicion all the four. The king should never act heedlessly in the<br>matter of watching his friends. A king that is heedless is always<br>overpowered by others. A wicked man assumes the garb of honesty, and he<br>that is honest becomes otherwise. A foe may become a friend and a friend<br>may become a foe. A man cannot always be of the same mind. Who is there<br>that would trust him completely? All the chief acts, therefore, of a king<br>he should accomplish in his own presence. A complete reliance (on his<br>ministers) is destructive of both morality and profit. A want of trust<br>again in respect of all is worse than death. Trustfulness is premature<br>death. One incurs danger by truthfulness. If one trusts another<br>completely, he is said to live by the sufferance of the trusted person.<br>For this reason every one should be trusted as also mistrusted. This<br>eternal rule of policy, O sire, should be kept in view. One should always<br>mistrust that person who would, upon one's desire, obtain one's wealth.<br>The wise declare such a person to be one's enemy. A person whose joy<br>knows no bounds upon beholding the aggrandisement of the king and who<br>feels miserable upon seeing the king's decay, furnishes the indications<br>of one of the best friends of the king. He whose fall would be brought<br>about by thy fall, should be trusted by thee completely even as thou<br>shouldst trust thy sire. Thou shouldst, to the best of thy power,<br>aggrandise him as thou winnest aggrandisement for thyself. One who, in<br>even thy religious rites, seeks to rescue thee from harm, would seek to<br>rescue thee from harm's way in every other business. Such a one should be<br>regarded as thy best friend. They, on the other hand, that wish one harm<br>are one's foes. That friend is said to be like thy own self who is<br>inspired with fear when calamity overtakes thee and with joy when<br>prosperity shines on thee. A person possessed of beauty, fair complexion,<br>excellent voice, liberality, benevolence, and good birth, cannot be such<br>a friend. That person who is possessed of intelligence and memory, who is<br>clever in the transaction of business, who is naturally averse from<br>cruelty, who never indulges in wrath, and who, whether regarded or<br>disregarded is never dissatisfied, be he thy priest or preceptor or<br>honoured friend should always receive thy worship if he accepts the<br>office of thy counsellor and resides in thy abode. Such a person may be<br>informed of thy most secret counsels and the true state of all thy<br>affairs religious or pertaining to matters of profit. Thou mayst confide<br>in him as in thy own sire. One person should be appointed to one task,<br>and not two or three. Those may not tolerate each other. It is always<br>seen that several persons, if set to one task, disagree with one another.<br>That person who achieves celebrity, who observes all restraints, who<br>never feels jealous of others that are able and competent, who never does<br>any evil act, who never abandons righteousness from lust or fear or<br>covetousness or wrath, who is clever in the transaction of business, and<br>who is possessed of wise and weighty speech, should be thy foremost of<br>ministers. Persons possessed of good birth and good behaviour, who are<br>liberal and who never indulge in brag, who are brave and respectable, and<br>learned and full of resources, should be appointed as ministers for<br>supervising all thy affairs. Honoured by thee and gratified with wealth,<br>they would act for thy good and be of great help to thee. Appointed to<br>offices connected with profit and other important matters they always<br>bring about great prosperity. Moved by a feeling of healthy rivalry, they<br>discharge all duties connected with profit, holding consultations with<br>one another when necessary. Thou shouldst fear thy kinsmen as thou<br>shouldst death itself. A kinsman can never bear a kinsman's prosperity<br>even as a feudatory chief cannot bear to see the prosperity of his<br>overlord. None but a kinsman can feel joy at the destruction of a kinsman<br>adorned with sincerity, mildness, liberality, modesty, and truthfulness<br>of speech. They, again, that have no kinsmen, cannot be happy. No men can<br>be more contemptible than they that are destitute of kinsmen. A person<br>that has no kinsmen is easily overridden by foes. Kinsmen constitute the<br>refuge of one that is afflicted by other men, for kinsmen can never bear<br>to see a kinsman afflicted by other people. When a kinsman is persecuted<br>by even his friends, every kinsman of the persecuted regards the injury<br>to be inflicted upon himself. In kinsmen, therefore, there are both<br>merits and faults. A person destitute of kinsmen never shows favours to<br>any one nor humbles himself to any one. In kinsmen, therefore both merit<br>and demerit may be marked. One should, for this reason, always honour and<br>worship his kinsmen in words and acts, and do them agreeable offices<br>without injuring them at any time. Mistrusting them at heart, one should<br>behave towards them as if he trusted them completely. Reflecting upon<br>their nature, it seems that they have neither faults nor merits. A person<br>who heedfully conducts himself in this way finds his very foes disarmed<br>of hostility and converted into friends. One who always conducts himself<br>in this way amid kinsmen and relatives and bears himself thus towards<br>friends and foes, succeeds in winning everlasting fame.'"
