                            Saunaka said, How is that illustrious god, viz., the puissant Narayana<br>who is fully conversant with the Vedas and their branches, at once the<br>doer and the enjoyer of sacrifices? Endued with forgiveness, he has<br>adopted, again, the religion of Nivritti (abstention). Indeed, it is that<br>holy and puissant one who has himself ordained the duties of Nivritti.<br>Why then has he made many of the deities the takers of shares in<br>sacrifices which, of course, are all due to the disposition of Pravritti?<br>Why has he again created some with a contrary disposition, for they<br>follow the ordinances of the religion of abstention? Do thou O Suta,<br>dispel this doubt, of ours. This doubt seems to be eternal and is<br>connected with a great mystery. Thou hast heard all discourses on<br>Narayana, discourses that are consistent with the (other)<br>scriptures.[1843]<br><br>Sauti said, O excellent Saunaka, I shall recite to thee what<br>Vaisampayana, the disciple of the intelligent Vyasa, said when questioned<br>on these very topics by king Janamejaya. Having heard the discourse on<br>the glory of Narayana who is the Soul of all embodied creatures,<br>Janamejaya, endued with great intelligence and wisdom, questioned<br>Vaisampayana on these very subjects.<br><br>Janamejaya said, "The whole world of Beings, with Brahma, the deities,<br>the Asuras and human beings, are seen to be deeply attached to actions<br>which have been said to be productive of prosperity. Emancipation has, O<br>regenerate one, been said by thee to be the highest felicity and to<br>consist of the cessation of existence. They who, being divested of both<br>merit and demerit, become emancipate, succeed, we hear, in entering the<br>great God of a thousand rays. It seems to be, O Brahmana, that the<br>eternal religion of Emancipation is exceedingly difficult of observance.<br>Turning away from it, all the deities have become enjoyers of the<br>libations of clarified butter poured with mantras on sacrificial fires<br>and other offerings presented to them by the same or similar means. Then,<br>again, Brahman, and Rudra, the puissant Sakra the slayer of Vala, Surya,<br>Chandramas (the Lord of the stars), the Wind-god, the Deity of fire, the<br>Deity of the Waters, Infinite Space (as living Being), the Universe too<br>(as a conscious agent), and the rest of the denizens of heaven,&#8212;they, it<br>seems, are ignorant of the way of securing annihilation of conscious<br>existence, that is capable of being brought about by<br>self-realisation.[1844] Hence, perhaps, they have not be taken themselves<br>to the path that is certain, indestructible, and immutable. Hence<br>perhaps, turning away from that path they have adopted the religion of<br>Pravritti which leads to conscious existence that is measured by time.<br>This, indeed, is one great fault that attaches to those that are wedded<br>to actions, for all their rewards are terminable. This doubt, O<br>regenerate one, is planted in my heart like a dagger. Remove it out by<br>reciting to me some discourses of old on this topic. Great is my<br>curiosity to listen to thee. For what reason, O regenerate one, have the<br>deities been said to be takers of their respective shares of sacrificial<br>offerings presented to them with the aid of mantras in sacrifices of<br>diverse kinds? Why again are the denizens of heaven adored in sacrifices?<br>And, O best of regenerate persons, to whom do they, that take their<br>shares of offerings in sacrifices performed to their honour, themselves<br>make offerings when they perform great sacrifices?"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "The question thou has asked me, O ruler of men,<br>relates to a deep mystery. No man that has not undergone penances, and<br>that is not acquainted with the Puranas, can speedily answer it. I shall,<br>however, answer thee by reciting to thee what my preceptor the<br>Island-born Krishna, otherwise called Vyasa, the great Rishi who has<br>classified the Vedas, had said unto us on a former occasion when<br>questioned by us. Sumanta, and Jaimini, and Paila of firm vows, and<br>myself numbering the fourth, and Suka forming the fifth, were disciples<br>of the illustrious Vyasa. We numbering five in all, endued with<br>self-restraint and purity of observances, had completely subjugated wrath<br>and controlled our senses. Our preceptor used to teach us the Vedas,<br>having the Mahabharata for their fifth. Once on a time, while we were<br>engaged in studying the Vedas on the breast of that foremost of<br>mountains, viz., the delightful Meru, inhabited by Siddhas and Charanas,<br>this very doubt arose in our minds that has been expressed by thee today.<br>We, therefore, questioned our preceptor about It. It heard the answer<br>that our preceptor made. I shall now recite that answer to thee, O<br>Bharata. Hearing these words that were addressed to him by his disciples<br>that dispeller of all kinds of darkness represented by ignorance, viz.,<br>the blessed Vyasa, the son of Parasara, said these words: have undergone<br>very severe, in fact, the austerest of penances. Ye best of men, I am<br>fully conversant with the Past, the Present, and the Future. In<br>consequence of those penances of mine and of the restraint under which I<br>kept my senses while I dwelt on the shores of the Ocean of milk, Narayana<br>became gratified with me. As the result of the great God's gratification,<br>this omniscience with respect to the Past, the Present, and the Future,<br>that was desired by me, arose in my mind. Listen now to me as I discourse<br>to you, in due order, on this great doubt that has disturbed your minds.<br>I have, with the eye of knowledge, beheld all that occurred in the<br>beginning of the Kalpa. He whom both the Sankhyas and those conversant<br>with Yoga call by the name of Paramatma (the Supreme Soul) comes to be<br>regarded as Mahapurusha (the Great Purusha) in consequence of his own<br>acts. From Him springs forth Abyakta (the Unmanifest), whom the learned<br>call Pradhana. From the puissant Unmanifest sprang, for the creation of<br>all the words, the Manifest (Byakta). He is called Aniruddha. That<br>Aniruddha is known among all creatures by the name of the Mahat Atma. It<br>is that Aniruddha who, becoming manifest, created the Grandsire Brahman.<br>Aniruddha is known by another name, viz., Ahankara (consciousness) and is<br>endued with every kind of energy. Earth, Wind, Space, Water, and Light<br>numbering the fifth, these are the five Mahabhutas (elements) that have<br>sprung from Ahankara. Having created the Mahabhutas (five in number), he<br>then created their attributes.[1845] Combining the Mahabhutas, he then<br>created diverse embodied Being. Listen to me as I recount them to you.<br>Marichi, Angiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, the high-souled<br>Vasishtha, and the Self-born Mann, these should be known as the eight<br>Prakritis. Upon these rest all the worlds. Then the Grandsire of all the<br>world, viz., Brahman, created, for the fulfilment of all creatures, the<br>Vedas with all their branches, as also the Sacrifices with their limbs.<br>From these eight Prakritis have sprung this vast universe. Then sprang<br>Rudra from the principle of wrath, starting into life, he created ten<br>others that were like him. These eleven Rudras are called by name of<br>Vikara-Purushas. The Rudras, the (eight) Prakritis, and the several<br>celestial Rishis, having started into life, approached Brahman with the<br>object of upholding the universe and its operations. Addressing the<br>Grandsire, they said, We have been created, O holy one, by thee, O thou<br>of great puissance. Tell each of us, O Grandsire, the respective<br>jurisdiction we shall be vested with. What particular jurisdictions have<br>been created by thee for supervising the different affairs? We, each,<br>should be endued with what kind of consciousness and shall take charge of<br>which of these? Do thou ordain also unto each of us the measure of<br>strength that we are to have for discharging the duties of our respective<br>jurisdictions.' Thus addressed by them, the great god replied unto them<br>in the following way.<br><br>"Brahman said, You have done well, ye deities, in speaking to me of this<br>matter. Blessed be you all! I was thinking of this very subject that has<br>engaged your attention. How should the three worlds be upheld and kept<br>agoing? How should your strength and mine be utilized towards that end?<br>Let all of us, leaving this place, repair to that unmanifest and foremost<br>of Beings who is the witness of the world, for seeking his protection. He<br>will tell us what is for our good. After this, those deities and Rishis,<br>with Brahman, proceeded to the northern shores of the Ocean of milk,<br>desirous of doing good to the three worlds. Arrived there, they began to<br>practise those austere penances that are declared by Brahman in the<br>Vedas. Those austerest of penances are known by the name of Mahaniyama<br>(the foremost vows and observances). They stood there with mind fixed,<br>immovable as posts of wood, and with eyes upturned and arms raised<br>upwards. For a thousand celestial years they were engaged in those severe<br>penances. At the conclusion of that period they heard these sweet words<br>in harmony with the Vedas and their branches.<br><br>"'The blessed and holy one said, Ye deities and Rishis possessed of<br>wealth of asceticism, with Brahman in your company, after according you<br>all welcome, I say unto you these words. I know that is in your hearts.<br>Verily, the thoughts that engage you are for the good of the three<br>worlds. I shall increase your energy and strength investing the same with<br>Pravritti (predilection for acts). Ye gods, well have you undergone these<br>penances from desire of adoring me. Ye foremost of Beings, enjoy now the<br>excellent fruits of austerities which ye have gone through. This Brahman<br>is the Lord of all the worlds. Endued with puissance, he is the Grandsire<br>of all creatures. Ye also are foremost of deities. Do ye all, with<br>concentrated minds perform sacrifices for my glory. In the sacrifices<br>which you will perform, do ye always give me a portion of the sacrificial<br>offerings. I shall then, ye lord of creation, assign to each of you your<br>respective jurisdictions and ordain what will be for your good!"'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Hearing these words of that God of gods, all<br>those deities and great Rishis and Brahman became filled with such<br>delight that the hair on their bodies stood on its end. They forthwith<br>made arrangements for a sacrifice in honour of Vishnu according to the<br>ordinances laid down in the Vedas. In that sacrifice, Brahman himself<br>dedicated a portion of the offerings to Vishnu. The deities and the<br>celestial Rishis also, after the manner of Brahman, dedicated similar<br>portions each unto the great God. The portions, thus offered with great<br>reverence unto Vishnu, were, in respect of both the measure and the<br>quality of the articles used, according to the ordinances laid down for<br>the Krita age. The deities and the Rishis and Brahman, in that sacrifice,<br>adored the great God as one endued with the complexion of the Sun, as the<br>foremost of Beings, situate beyond the reach of Tamas, vast, pervading<br>all things, the Supreme Lord of all, the giver of boons, and possessed of<br>puissance. Thus adored by them, the boon-giving and great God, invisible<br>and bodiless, addressed those assembled celestials from heaven and said<br>unto them:&#8212;"The offerings dedicated by you in this sacrifice have all<br>reached me. I am gratified with all of you. I shall bestow rewards on you<br>that will however, be fraught with ends whence there will be<br>return.[1846] This shall be your distinctive feature, ye gods, from this<br>day, in consequence of my grace and kindness for you. Performing<br>sacrifices in every Yuga, with large presents, ye will become enjoyers of<br>fruits born of Pravritti. Ye gods, those men also that will perform<br>sacrifices according to the ordinances of the Vedas, will give unto all<br>of you shares of their sacrificial offerings. In the Veda-sutras I make<br>him the receiver (in such sacrifices) of a share similar to that which he<br>has himself offered one in this sacrifice. Created to look after those<br>affairs that appertain to your respective jurisdictions, do ye uphold the<br>worlds according to the measures of your strength as dependent on the<br>shares you receive on those sacrifices. Indeed, drawing strength from<br>those rites and observances that will be current in the several worlds,<br>taking their rise from the fruits of Pravritti, do ye continue to uphold<br>the affairs of those worlds.[1847] Strengthened by the sacrifices that<br>will be performed by men, ye will strengthen me. These are the thoughts<br>that I entertain for you all. It is for this purpose that I have created<br>the Vedas and sacrifices and plants and herbs. Duly served with these by<br>human beings on Earth, the deities will be gratified. Ye foremost of<br>deities, till the end of this Kalpa, I have ordained your creation,<br>making your constitution depend upon the consequence of the religion of<br>Pravritti. Ye foremost of Beings, do ye then, as regards your respective<br>jurisdictions, engage yourselves in seeking the good of the three worlds.<br>Marichi, Angiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, and Vasishtha,&#8212;these<br>seven Rishis have been created by a fiat of the will. These will become<br>the foremost of persons conversant with the Vedas. In fact, they will<br>become the preceptors of the Vedas. They will be wedded to the religion<br>of Pravritti, for they have been intended to devote themselves to the act<br>of procreating offspring. This is the eternal path that I disclose of<br>creatures engaged in acts and observances. The puissant Lord who is<br>charged with the creation of all the worlds is called Aniruddha, Sana,<br>Sanatsujata, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatkumara, Kapila, and Sanatana<br>numbering the seventh,&#8212;these seven Rishis are known as the spiritual<br>sons of Brahman. Their knowledge comes to them of itself (without being<br>dependant on study or exertion). These seven are wedded to the religion<br>of Nivritti. They are the foremost of all persons conversant with Yoga.<br>They are possessed also of deep knowledge of the Sankhya philosophy. They<br>are preceptors of the scriptures on duty and it is they that introduce<br>the duties of the religion of Nivritti and cause them to flow in the<br>worlds. From Unmanifest (Prakriti) has flowed Consciousness and the three<br>great attributes (of Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas). Transcending Prakriti is<br>he called Kshetrajna. That Kshetrajna is myself. The path of those that<br>are wedded to Karma emerging out of Ahankara is fraught with return. One<br>cannot, by that path, reach the spot whence there is no return. Different<br>creatures have been created with different ends. Some are intended for<br>the path of Pravritti and some for that of Nivritti. According to the<br>path that a creature follows is the reward that he enjoys. This Brahman<br>is the master of all the worlds. Endued with puissance it is he that<br>creates the universe.[1848] He is your mother and father, and he is your<br>grandfather. At my command, he will be the giver of boons unto all<br>creatures. His son Rudra, who has sprung from his brow at his command,<br>will, endued with puissance, uphold all created beings. Go ye to your<br>respective jurisdictions, and seek, according to the ordinances, the good<br>of the worlds. Let all the scriptural acts flow in all the worlds. Let<br>there be no delay in this. Ye foremost of celestials, do ye ordain the<br>acts of all creatures and the ends that they are to attain therefore. Do<br>ye appoint also the limits of the periods for which all creatures are to<br>live. This present epoch that has been set to run is the foremost of all<br>epochs and should be known by the name of Krita. In this Yuga living<br>creatures should not be slain in the sacrifices that may be performed. It<br>should be as I ordain and let it not be otherwise. In this age, ye<br>celestials, Righteousness will flourish in its entirety.[1849] After this<br>age will come the epoch called Treta. The Vedas, in that Yuga, will lose<br>one quarter. Only three of them will exist. In the sacrifice that will be<br>performed in that age, animals, after dedication with the aid of sacred<br>mantras, will be slain. As regards Righteousness again, it will lose one<br>quarter; only three quarters thereof will flourish. On the expiration of<br>the Treta will come the mixed Yuga known by the name of Dwapara. In that<br>Yuga, Righteousness will lose two quarters and only two quarters thereof<br>will flourish. Upon the expiration of Dwapara the Yuga that will set in<br>will be called Kali yuga which will come under the influence of Tisya<br>constellation. Righteousness will lose full three quarters. Only a<br>quarter thereof will exist in all places.<br><br>"'When the great God said these words, the deities and the celestial<br>Rishis addressed him and said, If only a fourth part of Righteousness is<br>to exist in that age in every place, tell us O holy one, whither shall we<br>then go and what shall we do!<br><br>"'The blessed and holy one said, Ye foremost of celestials, ye should, in<br>that age, repair to such places where the Vedas and sacrifices and<br>Penances and Truth and Self-restraint, accompanied by duties fraught with<br>compassion for all creatures, will still continue to flourish. Sin will<br>never be able to touch you at all!<br><br>"'Vyasa continued, 'Thus commanded by the great God, the deities with all<br>the Rishis bowed their heads unto him and then proceeded to the places<br>they desired. After the Rishis and denizens of heaven had left that<br>place, Brahman remained there, desirous of beholding the great Deity<br>eminent in the form of Aniruddha. The foremost of deities then manifested<br>himself to Brahmana, having assumed a form that had a vast equine head.<br>Bearing a bowl (Kamandalu) and the triple stick, he manifested himself<br>before Brahman, reciting the while the Vedas with all their branches.<br>Beholding the great Deity of immeasurable energy in that form crowned<br>with an equine head, the puissant Brahman, the Creator of all the<br>worlds.. moved by the desire of doing good to his Creation, worshipped<br>that boon-giving Lord with a bend of his head, and stood before him with<br>hands joined in reverence. The great Deity embraced Brahman and then told<br>him these words.<br><br>"'The holy one said, Do thou, O Brahman, duly think of the courses of<br>acts which creatures are to follow. Thou art the great ordainer of all<br>created Beings. Thou art the master and the lord of the universe. Placing<br>this burthen on thee I shall soon be free from anxiety. At such times,<br>how-ever, when it will be difficult for thee to accomplish the purposes<br>of the deities I shall then appear in incarnate forms according to my<br>self-knowledge. Having said these words, that grand form with the equine<br>head disappeared then and there. Having received his command, Brahman too<br>proceeded quickly to his own region. It is for this, O blessed one, that<br>the eternal Deity, with the lotus in his navel, became the acceptor of<br>the first share offered in sacrifices and hence it is that He came to be<br>called as the eternal upholder of all Sacrifices. He himself adopted the<br>religion of Nivritti, the end after which those creatures strive that are<br>desirous of indestructible fruits. He ordained at the same time the<br>religion of Pravritti for others, with the view to giving variety to the<br>universe. He is the beginning, He is the middle, and He is the end of all<br>created Beings. He is their Creator and He is their one object of<br>meditation. He is the actor and He is the act. Having withdrawn the<br>universe into Himself at the end of the Yuga, He goes to sleep, and<br>awakening at the commencement of another Yuga, He once more creates the<br>universe, Do you all bow unto that illustrious one who is possessed of<br>high soul and who transcends the three attributes, who is unborn, whose<br>form is the universe, and who is the abode or refuge of all the denizens<br>of heaven, Do you bow unto Him who is the Supreme Lord of all creatures,<br>who is the Lord of the Adityas, and of the Vasus as well. Do you bow unto<br>Him who is the Lord of the Aswins, and the Lord of the Maruts, who is the<br>lord of all the Sacrifices ordained in the Vedas, and the Lord of the<br>Vedangas. Bow unto Him who always resides in the Ocean, and who is called<br>Hari, and whose hair is like the blades of the Munja grass. Bow unto Him<br>who is Peace and Tranquillity, and who imparts the religion of Moksha<br>unto all creatures. Bow unto Him who is the Lord of Penances, of all<br>kinds of energy, and of Fame, who is ever the Lord of Speech and the Lord<br>of all the Rivers also. Bow unto Him who is called Kaparddin (Rudra), who<br>is the Great Boar, who is Unicorn, and who is possessed of great<br>intelligence: who is the Sun, who assumed the well-known form with the<br>equine head; and who is always displayed in a four-fold form. Bow unto<br>Him who is unrevealed, who is capable of being apprehended by knowledge<br>only, who is both indestructible and destructible. The supreme Deity, who<br>is immutable, pervadeth all things. He is the Supreme Lord who can be<br>known with the aid of the eye of knowledge alone. It was thus that, aided<br>by the eye of Knowledge, I beheld in days of yore that foremost of<br>deities. Asked by you, I have told you everything in detail, ye<br>disciples, and do you act according to my words and dutifully serve the<br>Supreme Lord called Hari. Do you hymn His praises in Vedic words and<br>adore and worship Him also according to due rites!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "It was thus that the arranger of the Vedas,<br>endued with great intelligence, discoursed to us, questioned by us on<br>that occasion. His son, the highly righteous Suka, and all his disciples<br>(viz., ourselves) listened to him while he delivered that discourse. Our<br>preceptor, with ourselves, O king, then adored the great Deity with Richs<br>extracted from the four Vedas. I have thus told thee everything about<br>what thou hadst asked me. It was thus, O king, that our Island-born<br>preceptor discoursed to us. He who, having uttered the words&#8212;I bow unto<br>the holy Lord,&#8212;frequently listens, with concentrated attention, to this<br>discourse or reads or recites it to others, becomes endued with<br>intelligence and health, and possessed of beauty and strength. If ill, he<br>becomes freed from that illness, bound, freed from his bonds. The man who<br>cherishes desires obtains (be this) the fruition of all his desires, and<br>easily attains to a long life also. A Brahmana, by doing this, becomes<br>conversant with all the Vedas, and a Kshatriya becomes crowned with<br>success. A Vaisya, by doing it, makes considerable profits, and a Sudra<br>attains to great felicity. A sonless man obtains a son. A maiden obtains<br>a desirable husband. A woman that has conceived brings forth a son. A<br>barren woman conceives and attains to wealth of sons and grandsons. He<br>who recites this discourse on the way succeeds in passing happily and<br>without impediments of any kind along his way. In fact, one attains to<br>whatever objects one cherishes, if one reads or recites this narrative.<br>Hearing these words of the great Rishi, fraught with certainty of<br>conclusion, and embodying a recital of the attributes of that high-souled<br>one who is the foremost of all beings, hearing this narrative of the<br>great conclave of Rishis and other denizens of heaven,&#8212;men who are<br>devoted to the supreme Deity derive great happiness.'"
