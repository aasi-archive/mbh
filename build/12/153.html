                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Hast thou, O grandsire, ever seen or heard of any<br>mortal restored to life after having succumbed to death?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O king, to this story of the discourse between a<br>vulture and a jackal as happened of old. Indeed, the occurrence took<br>place in the forest of Naimisha. Once upon a time a Brahmana had, after<br>great difficulties, obtained a son of large expansive eyes. The child<br>died of infantile convulsions. Some (amongst his kinsmen), exceedingly<br>agitated by grief and indulging in loud lamentations, took up the boy of<br>tender years, that sole wealth of his family. Taking the deceased child<br>they proceeded in the direction of the crematorium, Arrived there, they<br>began to take the child from one another's breast and cry more bitterly<br>in grief. Recollecting with heavy hearts the former speeches of their<br>darling again and again, they were unable to return home casting the body<br>on the bare ground. Summoned by their cries, a vulture came there and<br>said these words: 'Go ye away and do not tarry, ye that have to cast off<br>but one child. Kinsmen always go away leaving on this spot thousands of<br>men and thousands of women brought here in course of time. Behold, the<br>whole universe is subject to weal and woe. Union and disunion may be seen<br>in turns. They that have come to the crematorium bringing with them the<br>dead bodies of kinsmen, and they that sit by those bodies (from<br>affection), themselves disappear from the world in consequence of their<br>own acts when the allotted periods of their own lives run out. There is<br>no need of your lingering in the crematorium, this horrible place, that<br>is full of vultures and jackals and that abounds with skeletons and<br>inspires every creature with dread. Whether friend or foe, no one ever<br>comes back to life having once succumbed to the power of Time. Such,<br>indeed, is the fate of all creatures, In this world of mortals, every one<br>that is born is sure to die. Who shalt restore to life one that is dead<br>and gone on the way ordained by the Destroyer? At this hour when men are<br>about to close their daily toil, the Sun is retiring to the Asta hills.<br>Go ye to your homes, casting off this affection for the child.' Hearing<br>these words of the vulture, the grief of the kinsmen seemed to abate, and<br>placing the child on the bare ground they prepared to go away. Assuring<br>themselves of the fact that the child had died and despairing of seeing<br>him again, they began to retrace their steps, indulging in loud<br>lamentations. Assured beyond doubt, and despairing of restoring the dead<br>to life, they cast off that offspring of their race, and prepared to turn<br>back from that spot. At this time a jackal, black as a raven, issued out<br>of his hole and addressed those departing kinsmen, saying, 'Surely, ye<br>that are kinsmen of that deceased child have no affection. There the sun<br>still shineth in the sky, ye fools! Indulge your feelings, without fear.<br>Multifarious are the virtue of the hour. This one may come back to life!<br>Spreading a few blades of Kusa grass on the ground and abandoning that<br>dear child on the crematorium, why do ye go away with hearts of steel and<br>casting off every affection for the darling? Surely, ye have no affection<br>for that sweet-speeched child of tender years, whose words, as soon as<br>they left his lips, used to gladden you greatly. Behold the affection<br>that even birds and beasts bear towards their offspring. Theirs is no<br>return for bringing up their young ones. Like the sacrifices of the<br>Rishis (that are never undertaken from desire of fruit or rewards) the<br>affection of quadrupeds of birds and insects, bears no reward in heaven.<br>Though delighting in their children, they are never seen to derive any<br>benefit from the latter either here or hereafter. 'Yet they cherish their<br>young ones with affection. Their children, growing up, never cherish them<br>in age. Yet are not they grieved when they do not behold their little<br>ones? Where, indeed, is affection to be seen in human beings that they<br>would own the influence of grief?[448] Where would you go leaving here<br>this child who is the perpetuator of his race? Do you shed tears for him<br>for some time, and do you look at him a little longer with affection?<br>Objects so dear are, indeed, difficult to abandon. It is friends and not<br>others that wait by the side of him that is weak, of him that is<br>prosecuted in a court of law, of him that is borne towards the<br>crematorium. Life-breaths are dear unto all, and all feel the influence<br>of affection. Behold the affection that is cherished by even those that<br>belong to the intermediate species![449] How, indeed, can you go away,<br>casting off this boy of eyes large as the petals of the lotus, and<br>handsome as a newly-married youth washed clean and adorned with floral<br>garlands?' Hearing these words of the jackal that had been indulging in<br>such expressions of touching grief, the men turned back for the sake of<br>the corpse.'<br><br>"The vulture said, 'Alas, ye men destitute of strength of mind, why do ye<br>turn back at the bidding of a cruel and mean jackal of little<br>intelligence? Why do you mourn for that compound of five elements<br>deserted by their presiding deities, no longer tenanted (by the soul),<br>motionless, and stiff as a piece of wood? Why do you not grieve for your<br>own selves? Do you practise austere penances by which you will succeed in<br>cleansing yourselves from sin? Everything may be had by means of<br>penances. What will lamentations do? ill-luck is born with the body.[450]<br>It is in consequence of that ill-luck that this boy has departed,<br>plunging you into infinite grief. Wealth, kine, gold, precious gems,<br>children, all have their root in penances. Penances again are the results<br>of yoga (union of the soul with Godhead). Amongst creatures, the measure<br>of weal or woe is dependent on the acts of a previous life. Indeed, every<br>creature comes into the world taking with him his own measure of weal and<br>woe. The son is not bound by the acts of the sire, or the sire by those<br>of the son. Bound by their own acts, good and bad, all have to travel by<br>this common road. Duly practise all the duties, and abstain from acts of<br>unrighteousness. Reverentially wait, according to the directions of the<br>scriptures, upon the gods and the Brahmanas. Cast off sorrow and<br>cheerlessness, and abstain from parental affection. Leave the child on<br>this exposed ground, and go ye away without delay. The actor alone enjoys<br>the fruit of acts, good or bad, that he does. What concern have kinsmen<br>with them? Casting off a (deceased) kinsman, however dear, kinsmen leave<br>this spot. With eyes bathed in tears, they go away, ceasing to display<br>affection for the dead. Wise or ignorant, rich or poor, every one<br>succumbs to Time, endued with acts, good and bad. What will you do by<br>mourning? Why do you grieve for one that is dead? Time is the lord of<br>all, and in obedience to his very nature he casts an equal eye on all<br>things. In pride of youth or in helpless infancy bearing the weight of<br>years or lying in the mother's womb, every one is subject to be assailed<br>by Death. Such indeed, is the course of the world.'<br><br>"The jackal said, 'Alas, the affection cherished by your weeping selves<br>that are overwhelmed with grief for your deceased child has been lessened<br>by that light-brained vulture. Even this must be the case, since in<br>consequence of his well-applied words fraught with tranquillity and<br>capable of producing conviction, there that one goes back to the town,<br>casting off affection that is so difficult to abandon. Alas, I had<br>supposed that great is the grief felt by men indulging in loud<br>lamentations for the death of a child and for the corpse on a<br>crematorium, like that of kine bereft of calves. Today, however, I<br>understand what the measure of grief is of human beings on earth.<br>Witnessing their great affection I had shed tears myself. (It seems<br>however, that their affection is not strong)! One should always exert<br>oneself. Thence does one succeed through destiny. Exertion and destiny,<br>joining together, produce fruit. One should always exert oneself with<br>hopefulness. How can happiness be had from despondency? Objects of desire<br>may be won by resolution. Why then do you go back so heartlessly? Where<br>do you go, abandoning in the wilderness this son of your own loins, this<br>perpetuator of the race of his sires? Stay here till the sun sets and the<br>evening twilight comes. You may then take away this boy with yourselves<br>or stay with him.'<br><br>"The vulture said, 'I am, ye men, a full thousand years of age today, but<br>I have never seen a dead creature, male or female or of ambiguous sex,<br>revive after death. Some die in the womb; some die soon after birth; some<br>die (in infancy) while crawling (on all fours); some die in youth; and<br>some in old age. The fortunes of all creatures, including even beasts and<br>birds, are unstable. The periods of life of all mobile and immobile<br>creatures are fixed beforehand. Bereaved of spouses and dear ones and<br>filled with sorrow for (the death of) children, men leave this spot every<br>day with agonised hearts for returning home. Leaving on this spot both<br>friends and foes numbering by thousands, kinsmen afflicted with grief go<br>back to their homes. Cast off this lifeless body with no longer any<br>animal heat in it and which is as stiff as a piece of wood! Why then do<br>you not go away, leaving the body of this child which has become like a<br>piece of wood and whose life has entered a new body? This affection<br>(which ye are displaying) is unmeaning and this hugging of the child is<br>fruitless. He does not see with his eyes or hear with his ears. Leaving<br>him here, go ye away without delay. Thus addressed by me in words which<br>are apparently cruel but which in reality are fraught with reason and<br>have a direct bearing with the high religion of emancipation, go ye back<br>to your respective homes.' Addressed thus by the vulture endued with<br>wisdom and knowledge and capable of imparting intelligence and awakening<br>the understanding, those men prepared themselves to turn their backs upon<br>the crematorium. Grief, indeed, increaseth to twice its measure at sight<br>of its object and at the remembrance of the acts of that object (in<br>life). Having heard these words of the vulture, the men resolved to leave<br>the spot. Just at that time the jackal, coming thither with quick steps,<br>cast his eyes on the child lying in the sleep of death.'<br><br>"The jackal said, 'Why, indeed, do you leave, at the vulture's bidding,<br>this child of golden complexion, adorned with ornaments, and capable of<br>giving the obsequial cake to his ancestors? If you abandon him, your<br>affection will not come to an end, nor these piteous lamentations. On the<br>other hand, your grief will certainly be greater. It is heard that a<br>Sudra named Samvuka having been slain and righteousness having been<br>upheld by Rama of true prowess, a (dead) Brahmana child was restored to<br>life.[451] Similarly, the son of the royal sage Sweta died (prematurely).<br>But the monarch, devoted to virtue, succeeded in reviving his dead child.<br>After the same manner, in your case also, some sage or deity may be<br>willing to grant your desire and show compassion to you that are crying<br>so piteously.' Thus addressed by the jackal, the men, afflicted with<br>grief and full of affection for the child, retraced their steps, and<br>placing the child's head on their laps one after another, began to<br>indulge in copious lamentations. Summoned by their cries, the vulture,<br>coming to that spot, spoke unto them as follows.'<br><br>"The vulture said, 'Why are you bathing this child with your tears? Why<br>are you pressing him in this fashion with the touch of your palms? At the<br>command of the grim king of justice the child has been sent to that sleep<br>which knows no waking. Those that are endued with the merit of penances,<br>those that are possessed of wealth, those that have great intelligence,<br>in fact, all succumb to death. Even this is the place intended for the<br>dead. It is always to be seen that kinsmen casting off thousands of<br>kinsmen young and old, pass their nights and days in grief, rolling on<br>the bare ground. Cease this ardour in putting on the trappings of woe.<br>That this child would come back to life is what passes belief. He will<br>not get back his life at the bidding of the jackal. If a person once dies<br>and takes leave of his body, his body never regains animation. Hundreds<br>of jackals, by laying down their own lives,[452] will not succeed in<br>reviving this child in hundreds of years. If, however, Rudra, or Kumara,<br>or Brahman, or Vishnu, grant him a boon, then only may this child come<br>back to life. Neither the shedding of tears, nor the drawing of long<br>sighs, nor copious lamentations, will bring back this one to life.<br>Myself, the jackal, you all, and all the kinsmen of this one, with all<br>our merits and sins, are on the same road (that this one has taken). For<br>this reason one possessed of wisdom should, from a distance, avoid<br>behaviour that displeases others, harsh speeches, the infliction of<br>injury on others, the enjoyment of other people's wives, and sin and<br>falsehood. Carefully seek righteousness, truth, the good of others,<br>justice, compassion for all creatures, sincerity, and honesty. They,<br>incur sin who, while living, do not cast their eyes upon their mothers<br>and fathers and kinsmen and friends. What will you do, by crying, for him<br>after death, that sees not with his eyes and that stirs not in the<br>least?' Thus addressed, the men, overwhelmed with sorrow and burning with<br>grief on account of their affection for the child, departed for their<br>homes, leaving the body (on the crematorium).<br><br>"The jackal said, 'Alas, terrible is the world of mortals! Here no<br>creature can escape. Every creature's period of life, again, is short.<br>Beloved friends are always departing. It abounds with vanities and<br>falsehoods, with accusations and evil reports. Beholding again this<br>incident that enhances pain and grief, I do not for a moment like this<br>world of men. Alas, fie on you, ye men, that thus turn back, like foolish<br>persons, at the vulture's bidding, though you are burning with grief on<br>account of the death of this child. Ye cruel wights, how can you go away,<br>casting off parental affection upon hearing the words of a sinful vulture<br>of uncleansed soul? Happiness is followed by misery, and misery by<br>happiness. In this world which is enveloped by both happiness and misery,<br>none of these two exists uninterruptedly. Ye men of little understanding,<br>whither would ye go, casting off on the bare ground this child of so much<br>beauty, this son that is an ornament of your race. Verily, I cannot<br>dispel the idea from my mind that this child endued with comeliness and<br>youth and blazing with beauty is alive. It is not meet that he should<br>die.[453] It seems that ye are sure to obtain happiness. Ye that are<br>afflicted with grief on account of the death of this child will surely<br>have good luck today. Anticipating the probability of inconvenience and<br>pain (if you remain here for the night) and fixing your hearts on your<br>own comfort, whither would you, like persons of little intelligence, go,<br>leaving this darling?'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Even thus, O king, the kinsmen of the deceased<br>child, unable to decide upon what they should do, were, for<br>accomplishment of his own purpose, induced by that sinful jackal who<br>uttered agreeable falsehoods, that denizens of the crematorium who<br>wandered every night in quest of food, to stay in that place.'<br><br>"The vulture said, 'Dreadful is this spot, this wilderness, that resounds<br>with the screech of owls and teems with spirits and Yakshas and<br>Rakshasas. Terrible and awful, its aspect is like that of a mass of blue<br>clouds. Casting off the dead body, finish the funeral rites. Indeed,<br>throwing away the body, accomplish those rites before the sun sets and<br>before the points of the horizon become enveloped in gloom. The hawks are<br>uttering their harsh cries. Jackals are howling fiercely. Lions are<br>roaring. The sun is setting. The trees on the crematorium are assuming a<br>dark hue in consequence of the blue smoke of the funeral pyres. The<br>carnivorous denizens of this place, afflicted with hunger, are yelling in<br>rage. All those creatures of horrible forms that live in this frightful<br>place, all those carnivorous animals of grim features that haunt this<br>desert, will soon assail you. This wilderness is certainly frightful.<br>Danger will overtake you. Indeed, if you listen to these false and<br>fruitless words of the jackal against your own good sense, verily, all of<br>you are sure to be destroyed.'<br><br>"The jackal said, 'Stay where you are! There is no fear even in this<br>desert as long as the sun shines. Till the god of day sets, do ye remain<br>here hopefully, induced by parental affection. Without any fear,<br>indulging in lamentations as ye please, continue to look at this child<br>with eyes of affection. Frightful though this wilderness be, no danger<br>will overtake you. In reality this wilderness presents an aspect of quiet<br>and peace. It is here that the Pitris by thousands took leave of the<br>world. Wait as long as the sun shines. What are this vulture's words to<br>you? If with stupefied understandings ye accept the cruel and harsh<br>speeches of the vulture, then your child will never come back to life!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The vulture then addressed those men, saying that<br>the sun had set. The jackal said that it was not so. Both the vulture and<br>the jackal felt the pangs of hunger and thus addressed the kinsmen of the<br>dead child. Both of them had girded up their loins for accomplishing<br>their respective purposes. Exhausted with hunger and thirst, they thus<br>disputed, having recourse to the scriptures. Moved (alternately) by these<br>words, sweet as nectar, of those two creatures, viz., the bird and the<br>beast, both of whom were endued with the wisdom of knowledge, the kinsmen<br>at one time wished to go away and at another to stay there. At last,<br>moved by grief and cheerlessness, they waited there, indulging in bitter<br>lamentations. They did not know that the boast and the bird, skilled in<br>accomplishing their own purposes, had only stupefied them (by their<br>addresses). While the bird and the beast, both possessed of wisdom.. were<br>thus disputing and while the kinsmen of the deceased child sat listening<br>to them, the great god Sankara, urged by his divine spouse (Uma), came<br>there with eyes bathed in tears of compassion. Addressing the kinsmen of<br>the deceased child, the god said, 'I am Sankara the giver of boons.' With<br>hearts heavy with grief, those men prostrated themselves before the great<br>deity and said unto him in reply, 'Bereft of this one who was our only<br>child, all of us are at the point of death. It behoveth thee to grant us<br>life by granting life to this our son.' Thus solicited, the illustrious<br>deity, taking up a quantity of water in his hands granted unto that dead<br>child life extending for a hundred years. Ever employed in the good of<br>all creatures, the illustrious wielder of Pinaka granted a boon unto both<br>the jackal and the vulture in consequence of which their hunger was<br>appeased. Filled with delight and having achieved great prosperity, the<br>men bowed unto the god. Crowned with success, they then, O king, left<br>that spot in great joy. Through persistent hopefulness and firm<br>resolution and the grace of the great god, the fruits of one's acts are<br>obtained without delay. Behold, the combination of circumstances and the<br>resolution of those kinsmen. While they were crying with agonised hearts,<br>their tears were wiped and dried up. Behold, how within only a short<br>time, through their steadiness of resolution, they obtained the grace of<br>Sankara, and their afflictions dispelled, they were made happy. Indeed,<br>through Sankara's grace, O chief of the Bharatas, those sorrowing kinsmen<br>were filled with amazement and delight at the restoration of their child<br>to life. Then, O king, casting off that grief of which their child had<br>been the cause, those Brahmanas, filled with delight, quickly went back<br>to their town taking the restored child with them. Behaviour like this<br>has been laid down for all the four orders. By frequently listening to<br>this auspicious story fraught with virtue, profit, and salvation, a man<br>obtains happiness both here and hereafter.'"
