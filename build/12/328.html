                            "Bhishma said, 'Having heard these words of king Janaka, Suka of cleansed<br>soul and settled conclusions began to stay in his Soul by his Soul,<br>having of course seen Self by Self.[1746] His object being accomplished,<br>he became happy and tranquil, and without putting further questions to<br>Janaka, he proceeded northwards to the mountains of Himavat with the<br>speed of the wind and like the wind.[1747] These mountains abounded with<br>diverse tribes of Apsaras and echoed with many lofty sounds. Teeming with<br>thousands of Kinnaras and Bhringarajas[1748] it was adorned, besides,<br>with many Madgus and Khanjaritas and many Jivajivakas of variegated hue.<br>And there were many peacocks also of gorgeous colours, uttering their<br>shrill but melodious cries. Many bevies of swans also, and many flights<br>of gladdened Kokilas too, adorned the place. The prince of birds, viz.,<br>Garuda, dwelt on that summit constantly. The four Regents of the world,<br>the deities, and diverse classes of Rishis, used always to come there<br>from the desire of doing good to the world. It was there that the<br>high-souled Vishnu had undergone the severest austerities for the object<br>of obtaining a son. It was there that the celestial generalissimo named<br>Kumara, in his younger days, disregarding the three worlds with all the<br>celestial denizens, threw down his dart, piercing the Earth therewith.<br>Throwing down his dart, Skanda addressing the universe, said,&#8212;If there<br>be any person that is superior to me in might, or that holds Brahmanas to<br>be dearer, or that can compare with me in devotion to the Brahmanas and<br>the Vedas, or that is possessed of energy like unto me, let him draw up<br>this dart or at least shake it!&#8212;Hearing this challenge, the three worlds<br>become filled with anxiety, and all creatures asked one another,<br>saying,&#8212;Who will raise this dart?&#8212;Vishnu beheld all the deities and<br>Asuras and Rakshasas to be troubled in their senses and mind. He<br>reflected upon what should be the best to be done under the<br>circumstances. Without being able to bear that challenge in respect of<br>the hurling of the dart, he cast his eyes on Skanda, the son of the<br>Fire-god. The pure-souled Vishnu caught hold of the blazing dart, with<br>his left hand, and began to shake it. When the dart was being thus shaken<br>by Vishnu possessed of great might, the whole Earth with her mountains,<br>forests, and seas, shook with the dart. Although Vishnu was fully<br>competent to raise the dart, still he contented himself with only shaking<br>it. In this, the puissant lord only kept the honour of Skanda intact.<br>Having shaken it himself, the divine Vishnu, addressing Prahlada,<br>said,&#8212;Behold the might of Kumara! None else in the universe can raise<br>this dart! Unable to bear this, Prahlada resolved to raise the dart. He<br>seized it, but was unable to shake it at all, Uttering a loud cry, he<br>fell down on the hill-top in a swoon. Indeed, the son of Hiranya-kasipu<br>fell down on the Earth. Repairing towards the northern side of those<br>grand mountains, Mahadeva, having the bull for his sign, had undergone<br>the austerest penances. The asylum where Mahadeva had undergone those<br>austerities is encompassed on all sides with a blazing fire.<br>Unapproachable by persons of uncleansed souls, that mountain is known by<br>the name of Aditya. There is a fiery girdle all around it, of the width<br>of ten Yojanas, and it is incapable of being approached by Yakshas and<br>Rakshasas and Danavas. The illustrious god of Fire, possessed of mighty<br>energy, dwells there in person employed in removing all impediments from<br>the side of Mahadeva of great wisdom who remained there for a thousand<br>celestial years, all the while standing on one foot. Dwelling on the side<br>of that foremost of mountains, Mahadeva of high vows (by his penances)<br>scorched the deities greatly.[1749] At the foot of those mountains, in a<br>retired spot, Parasara's son of great ascetic merit, viz., Vyasa, taught<br>the Vedas unto his disciples. Those disciples were the highly blessed<br>Sumantra, Vaisampayana, Jaimini of great wisdom, and Paila of great<br>ascetic merit. Suka proceeded to that delightful asylum where his sire,<br>the great ascetic Vyasa, was dwelling, surrounded by his disciples.<br>Seated in his asylum, Vyasa beheld his son approach like a blazing fire<br>of scattered flames, or resembling the sun himself in effulgence. As Suka<br>approached, he did not seem to touch the trees or the rocks of the<br>mountain. Completely dissociated from all objects of the senses, engaged<br>in Yoga, the high-souled ascetic came, resembling, in speed, a shaft let<br>from a bow. Born on the fire-sticks, Suka, approaching, his sire, touched<br>his feet. With becoming formalities he then accosted the disciples of his<br>sire. With great cheerfulness he then detailed to his father all the<br>particulars of his conversation with king Janaka. Vyasa the son of<br>Parasara, after the arrival of his puissant son, continued to dwell there<br>on the Himavat engaged in teaching his disciples and his son. One day as<br>he was seated, his disciples, all well-skilled in the Vedas, having their<br>senses under control, and endued with tranquil souls, sat themselves<br>around him. All of them had thoroughly mastered the Vedas with their<br>branches. All of them were observant of penances. With joined hands they<br>addressed their preceptor in the following words.<br><br>"The disciples said, We have, through thy grace, been endued with great<br>energy. Our fame also has spread. There is one favour that we humbly<br>solicit thee to grant us. Hearing these words of theirs, the regenerate<br>Rishi answered them, saying, "Ye sons, tell me what that boon is which ye<br>wish I should grant you! Hearing this answer of their preceptor, the<br>disciples became filled with joy. Once more bowing their heads low unto<br>their preceptor and joining their hands, all of them in one voice said, O<br>king, these excellent words: If our preceptor has been pleased with us,<br>then, O best of sages, we are sure to be crowned with success! We all<br>solicit thee, O great Rishi, to grant us a boon. Be thou inclined to be<br>graceful to us. Let no sixth disciple (besides us five) succeed in<br>attaining to fame! We are four. Our preceptor's son forms the fifth. Let<br>the Vedas shine in only as five! Even this is the boon that we<br>solicit;&#8212;Hearing these words of his disciples, Vyasa, the son of<br>Parasara, possessed of great intelligence, well-conversant with the<br>meaning of the Vedas, endued with a righteous soul, and always engaged in<br>thinking of objects that confer benefits on a person in the world<br>hereafter, said unto his disciples these righteous words fraught with<br>great benefit: The Vedas should always be given unto him who is a<br>Brahmana, or unto him who is desirous of listening to Vedic instructions,<br>by him who eagerly wishes to attain a residence in the region of Brahman!<br>Do ye multiply, Let the Vedas spread (through your exertions). The Vedas<br>should never be imparted unto one that has not formally become a<br>disciple. Nor should they be given unto one who is not observant of good<br>vows. Nor should they be given for dwelling in one that is of uncleansed<br>soul. These should be known as the proper qualifications of persons that<br>can be accepted as disciples (for the communication of Vedic knowledge).<br>No science should be imparted unto one without a proper examination of<br>one's character, as pure gold is tested by heat, cutting and rubbing,<br>after the same manner disciples should be tested by their birth and<br>accomplishments. Ye should never set your disciples to tasks to which<br>they should not be set, or to tasks that are fraught with danger. One's<br>knowledge is always commensurate with one's understanding and diligence<br>in study. Let all disciples conquer all difficulties, and let all of them<br>meet with auspicious success. Ye are competent to lecture on the<br>scriptures unto persons of all the orders. Only ye should, while<br>lecturing, address a Brahmana, placing him in the van. These are the<br>rules in respect of the study of the Vedas. This again is regarded as a<br>high task. The Vedas were created by the Self-born for the purpose of<br>praising the deities therewith. That man who, through stupefaction of<br>intellect, speaks ill of a Brahmana well-conversant with the Vedas, is<br>certain to meet with humiliation in consequence of such evil-speaking. He<br>who disregarding all righteous rules, solicits knowledge, and he who,<br>disregarding the rules of righteousness, communicates knowledge, either<br>of them falls off and instead of that affection which should prevail<br>between preceptor and disciple, such, questioning and such communication<br>are sure to produce distrust and suspicion. I have now told ye everything<br>about the way in which the Vedas should be studied and taught. Ye should<br>act in this way towards your disciples, bearing these instructions in<br>your minds.'"
