                            "Sauti said, 'After Vaisampayana had explained to king Janamejaya in this<br>way the glory of Narayana, he began to discourse on another topic by<br>reciting the question of Yudhishthira and the answer that Bhishma gave in<br>the presence of all the. Pandavas and the Rishis as also of Krishna<br>himself. Indeed, Vaisampayana began by saying what follows.[1924]<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast, O grandsire discoursed to us on the<br>duties appertaining to the religion of Emancipation. It behoveth thee now<br>to tell us what the foremost duties are of persons belonging to the<br>several modes of life!'[1925]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The duties ordained in respect of every mode of life are<br>capable, if well performed, of leading to heaven and the high fruit of<br>Truth. Duties which are as so many doors, to great sacrifices and gifts<br>and none of the practices inculcated by them are futile in respect of<br>consequence. One who adopts particular duties with steady and firm faith,<br>praises these duties adopted by him to the exclusion of the rest, O chief<br>of Bharata's race. This particular topic, however, on which thou wishest<br>me to discourse was in days of yore the subject of conversation between<br>the celestial Rishi Narada and the chief of the deities, viz., Indra. The<br>great Rishi Narada, O king, revered by all the world is a siddha i.e.,<br>his sadhana has met fulfilment. He wanders through all the worlds<br>unobstructed by anything, like the all-pervading wind itself. Once upon a<br>time he repaired to the abode of Indra. Duly honoured by the chief of the<br>deities, he sat close to his host. Beholding him seated at his ease and<br>free from fatigue, the lord of Sachi addressed him, saying,&#8212;O great<br>Rishi, is there any thing wonderful that has been beheld by thee, O<br>sinless one? O regenerate Rishi, crowned with ascetic success, thou<br>rovest, moved by curiosity, through the universe of mobile and immobile<br>objects, witnessing all things. O celestial Rishi, there is nothing in<br>the universe that is unknown to thee. Do thou tell me, therefore, of any<br>wonderful incident which thou may t have seen or heard of or felt. Thus<br>questioned, Narada, that foremost of speakers, O king, then commented to<br>recite unto the chief of the celestials the extensive history that<br>follows. Listen now to me as I recite that story which Narada told before<br>Indra. I shall narrate it in the same manner in which the celestial Rishi<br>had narrated it, and for the same purpose that he had in view!'"
