                            "Vyasa said, 'Observant of meritorious vows, the householder, for the<br>second period of life, should dwell in his house, having taken spouses<br>according to the ways indicated in the ordinance and having established<br>afire (of his own). As regards the domestic mode of life, four kinds of<br>conduct have been laid down by the learned. The first consists of keeping<br>a store of grain sufficient to last for three years. The second consists<br>of keeping a store to last for one year. The third consists of providing<br>for the day without thinking of the morrow. The fourth consists of<br>collecting grain after the manner of the pigeon.[998] Of these, each<br>succeeding one is superior in point of merit to that which precedes it,<br>according to what has been laid down in the scriptures.[999] A<br>householder observing the first kind of conduct may practise all the six<br>well-known duties (viz., sacrifice on his own account, sacrifice on that<br>of others, teaching, learning, making gifts, and accepting gifts). He who<br>observes the second kind of conduct should practise three only, of these<br>duties (viz., learning, giving, and taking). He who observes the third<br>kind of conduct should practise only two of the duties of domesticity<br>(viz., learning and giving). The householder practising the fourth kind<br>of domesticity should observe only one duty (viz., learning the<br>scriptures). The duties of the householder are all said to be exceedingly<br>meritorious. The householder should never cook any food for only his own<br>use; nor should be slaughter animals (for food) except in<br>sacrifices.[1000] If it be an animal which the householder desires to<br>kill (for food), or if it be a tree which he wishes to cut down (for<br>fuel), he should do either act according to the ritual laid down in the<br>Yajuses for that much is due to both animate and inanimate existences.<br>The house-holder should never sleep during the day, or during the first<br>part of the night, or during the last part thereof. He should never eat<br>twice between morning and evening, and should never summon his wife to<br>bed except in her season. In his house, no Brahmana should be suffered to<br>remain unfed or unworshipped. He should always worship such guests as are<br>presenters of sacrificial offerings, as are cleansed by Vedic lore and<br>observance of excellent vows, as are high-born and conversant with the<br>scriptures, as are observers of the duties of their own order, as are<br>self-restrained, mindful of all religious acts, and devoted to penances.<br>The scriptures ordain that what is offered to the deities and the Pitris<br>in sacrifices and religious rites is meant for the service of guests like<br>these. In this mode of life the scriptures ordain that a share of the<br>food (that is cooked) should be given unto every creature (irrespective<br>of his birth or character), unto one, that is, who for the sake of show<br>keeps his nails and beard, unto one who from pride displays what his own<br>(religious) practices are, unto one who has improperly abandoned his<br>sacred fire, and even unto one who has injured his preceptor. One leading<br>a domestic mode of life should give (food) unto Brahmacharins and<br>Sannyasins. The householder should every day become an eater of vighasa,<br>and should every day eat amrita. Mixed with clarified butter, the remains<br>of the food that is offered in sacrifices constitute amrita. That<br>householder who eats after having fed (all relatives and) servants is<br>said to eat vighasa. The food that remains after the servants have been<br>fed is called vighasa, and that which is left after the presentation of<br>sacrificial offerings is called amrita. One leading a domestic mode of<br>life should be content with his own wedded wife. He should be<br>self-restrained. He should avoid malice and subdue his senses. He should<br>never quarrel with his Ritwik, Purohita, and preceptor, with his maternal<br>uncle, guests and dependants, with the aged and the young in years, with<br>those that are afflicted with diseases, with those that practise as<br>physicians, with kinsmen, relatives, and friends, with his parents, with<br>women that belong to his own paternal family, with his brother and son<br>and wife, with his daughter, and with his servants. By avoiding disputes<br>with these, the householder becomes cleansed of all sins. By conquering<br>such disputes, he succeeds in conquering all the regions of felicity (in<br>the world hereafter). There is no doubt in this.[1001] The preceptor (if<br>duly reverenced) is able to lead one to the regions of Brahman. The<br>father (if reverenced) can lead to the regions of Prajapati. The guest is<br>puissant enough to lead to the region of Indra. The Ritwik has power in<br>respect of the regions of the deities. Female relatives of the paternal<br>line have lordship in respect of the regions of the Apsaras, and kinsmen<br>(by blood), in respect of the region of the Viswedevas. Relatives by<br>marriage and collateral kinsmen have power in respect of the several<br>quarters of the horizon (viz., north, etc.), and the mother and the<br>maternal uncle have power over the earth. The old, the young, the<br>afflicted the wasted have power over the sky.[1002] The eldest brother is<br>like unto the sire himself (to all his younger brothers). The wife and<br>the son are one's own body. One's menial servants are one's own shadow.<br>The daughter is an object of great affection. For these reason, a<br>house-holder endued with learning, observant of duties, and possessed of<br>endurance, should bear, without warmth or anxiety of heart every kind of<br>annoyance and even censure from the last named relatives. No righteous<br>household should do any act, urged by considerations of wealth. There are<br>three courses of duty in respect of a life of domesticity. Of these, that<br>which comes next (in the order of enumeration) is more meritorious than<br>the preceding one.[1003] As regards the four (principal) modes of life<br>also, the same rule of merit applies, viz., the one that comes after is<br>superior to the one preceding it. Accordingly, domesticity is superior to<br>Brahmacharya, forest life is superior to domesticity, and a life of<br>mendicancy or complete renunciation is superior to a forest life. One<br>desirous of prosperity should accomplish all those duties and rites that<br>have been ordained in the scriptures in respect of those modes. That<br>kingdom grows in prosperity where these highly deserving persons live,<br>viz., those that lead a life of domesticity according to the Kumbhadhanya<br>method, they that lead it according to the Unchha method, and they that<br>lead it according to the Kapoti method.[1004] That man who cheerfully<br>leads a life of domesticity in the observance of those duties, succeeds<br>in sanctifying ten generations of his ancestors above and ten generations<br>of descendants below. A householder, duly observing the duties of<br>domesticity, obtains an end that yields felicity equal to what occurs in<br>the regions attained by great kings and emperors. Even this is the end<br>that has been ordained for those who have subdued their senses. For all<br>high-souled householders heaven has been ordained. That heaven is<br>equipped with delightful cars for each (moving at the will of the rider).<br>Even that is the delightful heaven indicated in the Vedas. For all<br>householders of restrained souls, the regions of heaven constitute the<br>high reward. The Self-born Brahman ordained that the domestic mode of<br>life should be the productive cause of heaven. And since it has been so<br>ordained, a person, by gradually attaining to the second mode of life,<br>obtains happiness and respect in heaven. After this comes that high and<br>superior mode of life, called the third, for those that are desirous of<br>casting off their bodies. Superior to that of householders, that is the<br>life of forest recluses,&#8212;of those, that is, who waste their bodies (by<br>diverse kinds of austerities) into skeletons overlaid with dried skins.<br>Listen as I discourse to thee upon it.'"
