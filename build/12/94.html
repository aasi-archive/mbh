                            "Vamadeva said, 'The king should win victories without battles. Victories<br>achieved by battles are not spoken of highly. O monarch, by the wise.<br>When the sovereign's own power has not been confirmed, he should not seek<br>to make new acquisitions. It is not proper that a king whose power has<br>not been consolidated should seek to make such acquisitions. The power of<br>that king whose dominions are wide and abound with wealth, whose subjects<br>are loyal and contented, and who has a large number of officers, is said<br>to be confirmed. That king whose soldiery are contented, gratified (with<br>pay and prize), and competent to deceive foes can with even a small force<br>subjugate the whole earth. The power of that king whose subjects, whether<br>belonging to the cities or the provinces, have compassion for all<br>creatures, and possessed of wealth and grain, is said to be confirmed.<br>When the king thinks that his power is greater than that of a foe, he<br>should then, aided by his intelligence, seek to acquire the latter's<br>territories and wealth. A king whose resources are increasing, who is<br>compassionate unto all creatures, who never loses any time by<br>procrastination, and who is careful in protecting, his own self, succeeds<br>in earning advancement. That king who behaves deceitfully towards his own<br>people that have not been guilty of any fault, shears his own self like a<br>person cutting down a forest with an axe. If the king does not always<br>attend to the task of slaying his foes, the latter do not diminish. That<br>king, again, who knows how to kill his own temper finds no enemies. If<br>the king be possessed of wisdom, he would never do any act that is<br>disapproved by good men. He would, on the other hand, always engage<br>himself in such acts as would lead to his own benefit and that of others.<br>That king who, having accomplished all his duties, becomes happy in the<br>approbation of his own conscience, has never to incur the reproach of<br>others and indulge in regrets. That king who observes such conduct<br>towards men succeeds in subjugating both the worlds and enjoy the fruits<br>of victory.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by Vamadeva, king Vasumana did as he<br>was directed. Without doubt, thyself also, following these counsels,<br>shalt succeed in conquering both the worlds.'"
