                            "Kapila said, 'The Vedas are regarded as authoritative by all. People<br>never disregard them. Brahma is of two kinds, viz., Brahma as represented<br>by sound, and Brahma as Supreme (and intangible).[1256] One conversant<br>with Brahma represented by sound succeeds in attaining to Supreme Brahma.<br>Commencing with the rites of Garbhadhana, that body which the sire<br>creates with the aid of Vedic mantras is cleansed (after birth) by Vedic<br>mantras.[1257] When the body has been cleansed with purificatory rites<br>(performed with the aid of Vedic mantras), the owner there of come to be<br>called a Brahmana and becomes a vessel fit for receiving knowledge of<br>Brahma. Know that the reward of acts is purity of heart which only leads<br>to Emancipation. I shall presently speak to thee of that. Whether purity<br>of heart has been attained or not (by performance of acts) is what can be<br>known to the person himself who has attained it. It can never be known<br>with the aid of either the Vedas or inference. They that cherish no<br>expectation, that discard every kind of wealth by not storing anything<br>for future use, that are not covetous, and that are free from every kind<br>of affection and aversion, perform sacrifices because of the conviction<br>that their performance is a duty. To make gifts unto deserving persons is<br>the end (right use) of all wealth. Never addicted at any time to sinful<br>acts, observant of those rites that have been laid down in the Vedas,<br>capable of crowning all their wishes with fruition, endued with certain<br>conclusions through pure knowledge, never giving way to wrath,&#8212;never<br>indulging in envy, free from pride and malice, firm in Yoga,[1258] of<br>unstained birth, unstained conduct, and unstained learning, devoted to<br>the good of all creatures, there were in days of yore many men, leading<br>lives of domesticity and thoroughly devoted to their own duties, there<br>were many kings also of the same qualifications, devoted to Yoga (like<br>Janaka, etc.), and many Brahmanas also of the same character (like<br>Yajnavalkya and others).[1259] They behaved equally towards all creatures<br>and were endued with perfect sincerity. Contentment was theirs, and<br>certainty of knowledge. Visible were the rewards of their righteousness,<br>and pure were they in behaviour and heart. They were possessed of faith<br>in Brahma of both forms.[1260] At first making their hearts pure, they<br>duly observed all (excellent) vows. They were observant of the duties of<br>righteousness on even occasions of distress and difficulty, without<br>failing off in any particular. Uniting together they used to perform<br>meritorious acts. In this they found great happiness. And inasmuch as<br>they never tripped, they had never to perform any expiation. Relying as<br>they did upon the true course of righteousness, they became endued with<br>irresistible energy. They never followed their own understandings in the<br>matter of earning merit but followed the dictates of the scriptures alone<br>for that end. Accordingly they were never guilty of guile in the matter<br>of performing acts of righteousness.[1261] In consequence of their<br>observing unitedly the absolute ordinances of the scriptures without<br>betaking themselves ever to the rites laid down in the alternative, they<br>were never under the necessity of performing expiation.[1262] There is no<br>expiation for men living in the observance of the ordinances laid down in<br>the scriptures. The Sruti declares that expiation exists for only men<br>that are weak and unable to follow the absolute and substantive<br>provisions of the sacred law. Many Brahmanas there were of this kind in<br>days of old, devoted to the performance of sacrifices, of profound<br>knowledge of the Vedas, possessed of purity and good conduct, and endued<br>with fame. They always worshipped Brahma in the sacrifices, and were free<br>from desire. Possessed of learning they transcended all the bonds of<br>life. The sacrifices of these men, their (knowledge of the) Vedas, their<br>acts performed in obedience to the ordinances, their study of the<br>scripture at the fixed hours, and the wishes they entertained, freed as<br>they were from lust and wrath, observant as they were of pious conduct<br>and acts notwithstanding all difficulties, renowned as they were for<br>performing the duties of their own order and mode of life, purified as<br>their souls were in consequence of their very nature, characterised as<br>they were by thorough sincerity, devoted as they were to tranquillity,<br>and mindful as they were of their own practices, were identical with<br>Infinite Brahma. Even this is the eternal Sruti heard by us.[1263] The<br>penances of men that were so high-souled, of men whose conduct and acts<br>were so difficult of observance and accomplishment, of men whose wishes<br>were crowned with fruition in consequence of the strict discharge of<br>their duties, became efficacious weapons for the destruction of all<br>earthly desires. The Brahmanas say that that Good Conduct, which is<br>wonderful, whose origin may be traced to very ancient times, which is<br>eternal and whose characteristics are unchangeable, which differs from<br>the practices to which even the good resort in seasons of distress and<br>represents their acts in other situations, which is identical with<br>heedfulness, over which lust and wrath and other evil passions can never<br>prevail, and in consequence of which there was (at one time) no<br>transgression in all mankind, subsequently came to be distributed into<br>four subdivisions, corresponding with the four modes of life by persons<br>unable to practise its duties in minute detail and entirety.[1264] They<br>that are good, by duly observing that course of Good Conduct after<br>adoption of the Sannyasa mode of life, attain to the highest end. They<br>also that betake themselves to the forest mode reach the same high end<br>(by duly observing that conduct). They too that observe the domestic mode<br>of life attain to the highest end (by duly practising the same conduct);<br>and, lastly, those that lead the Brahmacharya mode obtain the same (end<br>by a due observance of the same conduct).[1265] Those Brahmanas are seen<br>to shine in the firmament as luminaries shedding beneficent rays of light<br>all around. Those myriads of Brahmanas have become stars and<br>constellations set in their fixed tracks. In consequence of contentment<br>(or Renunciation) they have all attained to Infinity as the Vedas<br>declare. If such men have to come back to the world through the wombs of<br>living creatures, they are never stained by sins which have the<br>unexhausted residue of previous acts for their originating cause. Indeed,<br>one who has led the life of a Brahmacharin and waited dutifully upon his<br>preceptor, who has arrived at settled conclusions (in respect of the<br>soul), and who has devoted himself to Yoga thus, is truly a Brahmana. Who<br>else would deserve to be called a Brahmana? When acts alone determine who<br>is a Brahmana and who is not, acts (good or bad) must be held to indicate<br>the happiness or misery of a person. As regards those that have by<br>conquering all evil passions acquired purity of heart, we have heard the<br>eternal Sruti that in consequence of the Infinity to which they attain<br>(through beholding the universal soul) and of the knowledge of Brahma<br>(they acquire through the declarations of Srutis), they behold everything<br>to be Brahma. The duties (of tranquillity, self-restraint, abstention<br>from acts, renunciation, devotion, and the abstraction of Samadhi)<br>followed by those men of pure hearts, that are freed from desire, and<br>that have Emancipation only for their object, for acquisition of the<br>knowledge of Brahma, are equally laid down for all the four orders of men<br>and all the four modes of life. Verily, that knowledge is always acquired<br>by Brahmanas of pure hearts and restrained soul.[1266] One whose soul is<br>for Renunciation based upon contentment is regarded as the refuge of true<br>knowledge. Renunciation, in which is that knowledge which leads to<br>Emancipation, and which is highly necessary for a Brahmana, is eternal<br>(and comes down from preceptor to pupil for ever and ever).[1267]<br>Renunciation sometimes exists mixed with the duties of other modes. But<br>whether existing in that state or by itself, one practises it according<br>to the measure of one's strength (that depends upon the degree of one's<br>absence of worldly desires). Renunciation is the cause of supreme benefit<br>unto every kind of person. Only he that is weak, fails to practise it.<br>That pure-hearted man who seeks to attain to Brahma becomes rescued from<br>the world (with its misery).'[1268]<br><br>"Syumarasmi said, 'Amongst those that are given up to enjoyment (of<br>property), they that make gifts, they that perform sacrifices, they that<br>devote themselves to the study of the Vedas, and they that betake<br>themselves to a life of Renunciation after having acquired and enjoyed<br>wealth and all its pleasures, when they depart from this world, who is it<br>that attains to the foremost place in heaven? I ask thee this, O<br>Brahmana! Do thou tell me truly.'<br><br>"Kapila said, 'Those who lead a life of domesticity are certainly<br>auspicious and acquire excellence of every kind. They are unable,<br>however, to enjoy the felicity that attaches to Renunciation. Even thou<br>mayst see this.'[1269]<br><br>"Syumarasmi said, 'Ye depend upon knowledge as the means (for the<br>attainment of Emancipation). Those who lead lives of domesticity have<br>planted their faith in acts. It has, however, been said that the end of<br>all modes of life is Emancipation.[1270] No difference, therefore, is<br>observable between them in respect of either their superiority or<br>inferiority of puissance. O illustrious one, do thou tell me then how<br>stands the matter truly.'<br><br>"Kapila said, 'Acts only cleanse the body. Knowledge, however, is the<br>highest end (for which one strives).[1271] When all faults of the heart<br>are cured (by acts), and when the felicity of Brahma becomes established<br>in knowledge, benevolence, forgiveness, tranquillity, compassion,<br>truthfulness, and candour, abstention from injury, absence of pride,<br>modesty, renunciation, and abstention from work are attained. These<br>constitute the path that lead to Brahma. By those one attains to what is<br>the Highest. That the cure of all faults of the heart is the result of<br>acts becomes intelligible to the wise man when these are attained. That,<br>indeed, is regarded as the highest end which is obtained by Brahmanas<br>endued with wisdom, withdrawn from all acts, possessed of purity and the<br>certitude of knowledge. One who succeeds in acquiring a knowledge of the<br>Vedas, of that which is taught by the Vedas (viz., Brahma as represented<br>in acts), and the minutiae of acts, is said to be conversant with the<br>Vedas. Any other man is only a bag of wind.[1272] One who is conversant<br>with the Vedas knows everything, for everything is established on the<br>Vedas. Verity, the present, past, and future all exist in the<br>Vedas.[1273] This one conclusion is deducible from all the scriptures,<br>viz., that this universe exists and does not exist. To the man of<br>knowledge this (all that is perceived) is both sat and asat. To him, this<br>all is both the end and the middle.[1274] This truth rests upon all the<br>Vedas, viz., that when complete Renunciation takes place one obtains what<br>is sufficient. Then again the highest contentment follows and rests upon<br>Emancipation,[1275] which is absolute, which exists as the soul of all<br>mortal and immortal things, which is well-known as such universal soul,<br>which is the highest object of knowledge as being identical with all<br>mobile and immobile things, which is full, which is perfect felicity,<br>which is without duality, which is the foremost of all things, which is<br>Brahma, which is Unmanifest and the cause also, whence the Unmanifest has<br>sprung, and which is without deterioration of any kind.[1276] Ability to<br>subdue the senses, forgiveness, and abstention from work in consequence<br>of the absence of desire,&#8212;these three are the cause of perfect felicity.<br>With the aid of these three qualities, men having understanding for their<br>eyes succeed in reaching that Brahma which is uncreate, which is the<br>prime cause of the universe, which is unchangeable and which is beyond<br>destruction. I bow to that Brahma, which is identical with him that knows<br>it.'"[1277]
