                            Vaisampayana said, "In this connection, the high-souled Yudhishthira said<br>unto Arjuna these words fraught with reason. 'Thou thinkest, O Partha,<br>that there is nothing superior to wealth, and that the poor man can<br>neither have heaven, nor happiness, nor the acquisition of his wishes.<br>This, however, is not true. Many persons are seen that have been crowned<br>with success through sacrifice in the shape of Vedic study. Many sages<br>are seen by devotion to penances to have acquired eternal regions of<br>bliss. They, O Dhananjaya, who always observe the practices of the Rishis<br>by betaking themselves to Brahmacharya and who become acquainted with all<br>duties, are regarded by the gods as Brahmanas. O Dhananjaya, thou<br>shouldst always regard those Rishis that are devoted to the study of the<br>Vedas and those that are devoted to the pursuit of true knowledge as<br>persons that are truly virtuous. O son of Pandu, all our acts depend upon<br>those that are devoted to the acquisition of true knowledge.[76] We know<br>this to be the opinion of the Vaikhanasas, O puissant one! The Ajas, the<br>Prishnis, the Sikatas, O Bharata, the Arunas, and the Kitavas, have all<br>gone to heaven through the merit of Vedic study. By performing those<br>acts, O Dhananjaya, that are indicated in the Vedas, viz., battle, study<br>of the Vedas, sacrifices, the restraint of passion that is so difficult,<br>one goes to heaven by the southern path of the Sun (Dakshinayana). I<br>have, before this, told thee that those very regions belong to persons<br>that are observant of (Vedic) acts. Thou shalt see, however, that the<br>northern path (Uttarayana) is travelled by those that are devoted to Yoga<br>penances. Those eternal and bright regions to which that path leads<br>belong to men of Yoga. Of these two, the northern path is much applauded<br>by those conversant with the Puranas. Thou shouldst know that one<br>acquires heaven through contentment. From contentment springs great<br>happiness. There is nothing higher than contentment. Unto the Yogin who<br>has controlled wrath and joy, contentment is his high praise and success.<br>In this connection is cited the discourse by Yayati of old. Listening to<br>that discourse one may succeed in withdrawing all his desires like a<br>tortoise drawing in all his limbs. When one cherishes no fear of<br>anything, when one is not feared by anything, when one cherishes no<br>desire, when one bears no hate, then is one said to have attained to the<br>state of Brahma. When one does not bear sinfully towards any creature, in<br>act, thought, or word, one is then said to have attained to Brahma. When<br>one has controlled his pride and folly, and withdrawn himself from all<br>attachments, it is then that that pious man of irradiated soul becomes<br>fit for attaining to that salvation which consists in the annihilation of<br>separate existence. Listen now to me with concentrated attention, O son<br>of Pritha, as I say it unto thee. Some desire virtue; some, good conduct;<br>and some wealth. One may desire wealth ( as a means for the acquisition<br>of virtue). The abandonment, however, of such desire would be better for<br>him.[77] There are many faults attached to wealth and consequently to<br>those religious acts that are performed with wealth. We have seen it with<br>our own eyes. It behoveth thee also to see this. He that desires wealth<br>finds it very difficult to abandon that which should by every means be<br>abandoned. Good deeds are very rare in those that amass riches. It is<br>said that wealth can never be acquired without injuring others, and that,<br>when earned, it brings numerous troubles. A person of narrow heart,<br>setting at naught the fear of repentance, commits acts of aggression<br>towards others, tempted by even a little wealth, unconscious all the<br>while of the sin of Brahmanicide that he incurs by his acts. Obtaining<br>wealth which is so difficult of acquisition, one burns with grief if one<br>has to give a portion of it to one's servants,&#8212;with grief, that is,<br>which is equal to what one would feet if one is actually robbed by<br>depredators. If, on the other hand, one does not part with one's wealth,<br>obloquy becomes one's share. One, however, that has no wealth, never<br>becomes the subject of censure. Withdrawn from all attachments, such a<br>person can become happy in all respects by supporting life upon what<br>little he may obtain as alms. No one, however, can be happy by the<br>acquisition of wealth. In this connection certain verses relating to<br>sacrifices are recited by persons conversant with ancient scriptures.<br>Wealth was created by the Creator for the sake of sacrifices, and man was<br>created by him for protecting that wealth and performing sacrifices. For<br>this, all wealth should be applied to sacrifices. It is not proper that<br>it should be spent for the gratification of desire of enjoyment. The<br>Creator then confers wealth upon mortals for the sake of sacrifices. Know<br>this, O son of Kunti, thou that art the foremost of all wealthy persons!<br>It is for this that the wise think that wealth, without doubt, is<br>nobody's on earth. One should perform sacrifices with it and give it away<br>with a trustful heart. One should spend (in gift) what one has acquired,<br>and not waste or spend it in gratifying one's desire of enjoyment. What<br>use is there in amassing wealth when such proper objects exist in which<br>to spend it? Those persons of little understanding that give away<br>(wealth) unto men that have swerved from the duties of their order, have<br>to subsist hereafter for a hundred years on ordure and dirt. That men<br>give unto the undeserving and refrain from giving unto the deserving is<br>due to inability to discriminate between the deserving and the<br>undeserving. For this reason the practice of even the virtue of charity<br>is difficult. These are the two faults connected with wealth even when<br>acquired, viz., gift to an undeserving person and abstaining from giving<br>unto him that is deserving.'"
