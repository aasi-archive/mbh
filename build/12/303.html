                            "Yudhishthira said, 'What is that which is called Undeteriorating and by<br>attaining to which no one has to come back? What, again, is that which is<br>called Deteriorating, and by attaining to which one has to return once<br>more? O slayer of foes, I ask thee the distinction that exists, O thou of<br>mighty arms, between the Deteriorating and the Undeteriorating ones for<br>understanding them both truly, O delighter of the Kurus, Brahmanas<br>conversant with the Vedas speak of thee as an Ocean of knowledge.<br>Highly-blessed Rishis and Yatis of high souls do the same. Thou hast very<br>few days to live. When the Sun turns from the southern path for entering<br>into the northern, thou shalt attain to thy high end. When thou shalt<br>leave us, from whom shall we hear of all that is beneficial for us? Thou<br>art the lamp of Kuru's race. Indeed thou art always blazing with the<br>light of knowledge. O perpetuator of Kuru's race, I desire, therefore to<br>hear all this from thee. Listening to thy discourses that are always<br>sweet like nectar, my curiosity, without being satiated is always<br>increasing!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall, in this connection, relate to thee the old<br>narrative of the discourse that took place between Vasishtha and king<br>Karala of Janaka's race. Once on a time when that foremost of Rishis,<br>viz., Vasishtha, endued with the effulgence of the Sun, was seated at his<br>ease, king Janaka asked him about that highest knowledge which is for our<br>supreme good. Highly proficient in that department of knowledge which is<br>concerned with the Soul and possessed of certain conclusions in respect<br>of all branches of that science,[1608] as Maitravaruni, that foremost of<br>Rishis, was seated the king approaching him with joined hands, asked him<br>in humble words, well pronounced and sweet and destitute of all<br>controversial spirit, the question,&#8212;O holy one, I desire to hear, of<br>Supreme and Eternal Brahma by attaining to which men of wisdom have not<br>to come back. I desire also to know that which is called Destructible and<br>That into which this universe enters when destroyed. Indeed, what is That<br>which is said to be indestructible, suspicious, beneficial and free from<br>evil of every kind?<br><br>"Vasishtha said, Hear, O lord of Earth, as to haw this universe is<br>destroyed, and, of That which was never destroyed and which will never be<br>destroyed at any time. Twelve thousand years, (according to the measure<br>of the celestials), make a Yuga, four such Yugas taken a thousand times,<br>make a Kalpa which measures one day of Brahman.[1609] Brahman's night<br>also, O king, is of the same measure. When Brahman himself is<br>destroyed[1610]. Sambhu of formless soul and to whom the Yuga attributes<br>of Anima, Laghima, &c, naturally inhere, awakes, and once more creates<br>that First or Eldest of all creatures, possessed of vast proportions of<br>infinite deeds, endued with form, and identifiable with the universe.<br>That Sambhu is otherwise called Isana (the lord of everything). He is<br>pure Effulgence, and transcends all deterioration, having his hands and<br>feet stretching in all directions, with eyes and head and mouth<br>everywhere, and with ears also in every place. That Being exists,<br>overwhelming the entire universe. The eldest-born Being is called<br>Hiranyagarbha. This holy one has (in the Vedanta) been called the<br>Understanding. In the Yuga scriptures He is called the Great, and<br>Virinchi, and the Unborn. In the Sankhya scriptures, He is indicated by<br>diverse name, and regarded as having Infinity for his Soul. Of diverse<br>forms and constituting the soul of the universe. He is regarded as One<br>and Indestructible. The three worlds of infinite ingredients have been<br>created by Him without assistance from any source and have been<br>overwhelmed by him. In consequence of His manifold forms, He is said to<br>be of universal form. Undergoing modifications He creates Himself by<br>Himself. Endued with mighty energy, He first creates Consciousness and<br>that Great Being called Prajapati endued with Consciousness. The Manifest<br>(or Hiranyagarbha) is created from the Unmanifest. This is called by the<br>learned the Creation of Knowledge. The creation of Mahan (or Virat) and<br>Consciousness, by Hiranyagarbha, is the creation of Ignorance.[1611]<br>Ascription of attributes (worthy of worship) and the destruction thereof,<br>called respectively by the names of Ignorance and Knowledge by persons<br>learned by the interpretation of the Srutis, then arose, referring to<br>this, that, or the other of the three (viz., Akshara, Hiranyagarbha, or<br>Virat).[1612] Know, O king, that the creation of the (subtile) elements<br>from consciousness is the third.[1613] In all kinds of consciousness is<br>the fourth creation which flows modification of the third. This fourth<br>creation comprises Wind and Light and Space and Water and Earth, with<br>their properties of sound, touch, form, taste and scent. This aggregate<br>of ten arose, without doubt, at the same time. The fifth creation, O<br>monarch, is that which has arisen from combination of the primal elements<br>(named above). This comprises the ear, the skin, the eyes, the tongue,<br>and the nose forming the fifth, and speech, and the two hands, and the<br>two legs, and the lower duct, and the organs of generation. The first<br>five of these constitute the organs of knowledge, and the last five the<br>organs of action. All these, with mind, arose simultaneously O king.<br>These constitute the four and twenty topics that exist in the forms of<br>all living creatures. By understanding these properly, Brahmanas<br>possessed of insight into the truth have never to yield to sorrow. In the<br>three worlds a combination of these, called body, is possessed by all<br>embodied creatures. Indeed, O king a combination of those is known as<br>such in deities and men and Danavas, and Yakshas and spirits and<br>Gandharvas and Kinnaras and great snakes, and Charanas and Pisachas, in<br>celestial Rishis and Rakshasas, in biting flies, and worms, and gnats,<br>and vermin born of filth and rats, and dogs and Swapakas and Chaineyas<br>and Chandalas and Pukkasas in elephants and steeds and asses and tigers,<br>and trees and kine. Whatever other creatures exist in water or space or<br>on earth, for there is no other place in which creatures exist as we have<br>heard, have this combination. All these, O sire, included within the<br>class called Manifest, are seen to be destroyed day after day. Hence, all<br>creatures produced by union of these four and twenty are said to be<br>destructible.<br><br>"This then is the Indestructible. And since the universe, which is made<br>up of Manifest and Unmanifest, meet with destruction, therefore, it is<br>said to be Destructible. The very Being called Mahan who is the<br>eldest-born is always spoken of as an instance of the Destructible. I<br>have now told thee, O monarch, all that thou hadst asked me. Transcending<br>the four and twenty topics already adverted to is the twenty-fifth called<br>Vishnu. That Vishnu in consequence of the absence of all attributes, is<br>not a topic (of knowledge) though as then which pervades all the topics,<br>he has been called so by the wise. Since that which is destructible has<br>caused all this that is Manifest, therefore, all this is endued with<br>form. The twenty-fourth, which is Prakriti, is said to preside over all<br>this (which has sprung from her modifications). The twenty-fifth, which<br>is Vishnu, is formless and, therefore, cannot be said to preside over the<br>universe.[1614] It is that Unmanifest (Prakriti), which, when endued with<br>body (in consequence of union with Chit) dwells in the hearts of all<br>creatures endued with body. As regards eternal Chetana (the<br>Indestructible), although he is without attributes and without form, yet<br>he (in consequence of a union with Prakriti) assumes all forms. Uniting<br>with Prakriti which has the attributes of birth and death, he also<br>assumes the attributes of birth and death. And in consequence of such<br>union he becomes an object of perception and though in reality divested<br>of all attributes yet he comes to be invested therewith. It is in this<br>way that the Mahan-Soul (Hiranyagarbha), becoming united with Prakriti<br>and invested with Ignorance, undergoes modifications and becomes<br>conscious of Self. Uniting with the attributes of Sattwa and Rajas and<br>Tamas, he becomes identified with diverse creatures belonging to diverse<br>orders of Being, in consequence of his forgetfulness and his waiting upon<br>Ignorance. In consequence of his birth and destruction arising from the<br>fact of his dwelling in upon with Prakriti, he thinks himself to be no<br>other than what he apparently is. Regarding himself as this or that, he<br>follows the attributes of Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas. Under the influence<br>of Tamas, he attains to diverse kinds of conditions that are affected by<br>Tamas. Under the influence of Rajas and Sattwa, he attains similarly to<br>conditions that are affected by Rajas and Sattwa. There are three colours<br>in all, viz., White, Red, and Dark. All those colours appertain to<br>Prakriti (so that He it is who becomes White or Red or Dark according as<br>the nature of the Prakriti with which is He becomes identified for the<br>time being). Through Tamas one goes to hell. Through Rajas one attains to<br>and remains in the status of humanity. Through Sattwa, people ascend to<br>the regions of the deities and become sharers of great felicity. By<br>adhering to sin continuously one sinks into the intermediate order of<br>beings. By acting both righteously and sinfully one attains to the status<br>of the deities. In this way the twenty-fifth, viz., Akshara (the<br>Indestructible), the wise say, by union with the unmanifest (Prakriti),<br>becomes transformed into Kshara (destructible). By means of knowledge<br>however, the Indestructible becomes displayed in His true nature&#8212;"
