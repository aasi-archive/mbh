                            "Indra said, 'Kshatriya duties, O king, which are possessed of such<br>energy, which include in their exercise all other duties, and which are<br>the foremost of all duties, should be observed by persons that are, like<br>thee, so high-souled and so employed in seeking the good of the world. If<br>those duties are not properly discharged, all creatures would be<br>overtaken by ruin. The kings possessed of compassion for all creatures,<br>should regard these to be the foremost of his duties, reclaiming the land<br>for cultivation and fertilizing it, performance of great sacrifices for<br>cleansing himself, a disregard for begging, and protection of subjects.<br>Abandonment (gift) is said by the sages to be the foremost of virtues. Of<br>all kinds of abandonment, again, that of the body in battle, is the<br>foremost. Thou hast seen with thy eyes how the rulers of the earth, ever<br>observant of Kshatriya duties, having duly waited upon their preceptors<br>and acquired great learning, at last cast off their bodies, engaged in<br>battle with one another. The Kshatriya, desirous of acquiring religious<br>merit, should, after having gone through the Brahmacharya mode, should<br>lead a life of domesticity which is always meritorious. In adjudicating<br>upon ordinary questions of right (between his subjects), he should be<br>thoroughly impartial. For causing all the orders to be observant of their<br>respective duties, for the protection they afford to all, for the diverse<br>contrivances and means and the prowess and exertion (with which they seek<br>the accomplishment of their objects). Kshatriya duties, which include all<br>other duties within their scope, are said to be the foremost. The other<br>orders are able to observe their respective duties in consequence of<br>kingly duties. For this reason the former are said to be dependent upon<br>the latter in respect of the merit they produce.[205] Those men who<br>disregard all wholesome restraints and who are too much attached to the<br>pursuit of worldly objects are said to be of the nature of brutes. They<br>are compelled to act with justice by the exercise of kingly duties. Those<br>duties, therefore, are said to be the foremost of all. That course of<br>conduct which has been prescribed for Brahmanas who follow the three<br>Vedas, and those modes of life that have been laid down for Brahmanas,<br>should, before everything else, be observed by every Brahmana. If a<br>Brahmana acts otherwise, he should be punished like a Sudra. The duties<br>of the four modes of life and the ritual prescribed in the Vedas, O king,<br>should ever be followed by a Brahmana. Know that he has no other duties.<br>For a Brahmana acting otherwise, a Kshatriya should not make any<br>arrangement for sustenance. His religious merit grows in consequence of<br>his acts. A Brahmana, indeed, is like Dharma's self. That Brahmana who is<br>employed in acts that are not laid down for him, deserves no respect. If<br>not engaged in his proper acts, he should not be trusted. These are the<br>duties that appertain to the several orders. Kshatriyas should take care<br>of them so that their observance may be improved. Even these are the<br>duties of Kshatriyas. For these reasons also, kingly duties and no other,<br>are the foremost of all. They are, as I believe, the duties of heroes,<br>and they that are heroes are foremost in practising them.'<br><br>"Mandhatri said, 'What duties should be performed by the Yavanas, the<br>Kiratas, the Gandharvas, the Chinas, the Savaras, the Barbaras, the<br>Sakas, the Tusharas, the Kankas, the Pathavas, the Andhras, the Madrakas,<br>the Paundras, the Pulindas, the Ramathas, the Kamvojas, the several<br>castes that have sprung Lip from Brahmanas and Kshatriyas, the Vaisyas,<br>and the Sudras, that reside in the dominions of (Arya) kings? What are<br>those duties again to the observance of which kings like ourselves should<br>force those tribes that subsist by robbery? I desire to hear all this. O<br>illustrious god, instruct me. O chief of all the deities, thou art the<br>friend of us Kshatriyas.'<br><br>"Indra said, 'All the robber tribes should serve their mothers and<br>fathers, their preceptors and other seniors, and recluses living in the<br>woods. All the robber tribes should also serve their kings. The duties<br>and rites inculcated in the Vedas should also be followed by them. They<br>should perform sacrifices in honour of the Pitris, dig wells, (and<br>dedicate them to universal service), give water to thirsty travellers,<br>give away beds and make other seasonable presents unto Brahmanas.<br>Abstention from injury, truth, suppression of wrath, supporting Brahmanas<br>and kinsmen by giving them their dues, maintenance of wives and children,<br>purity, peacefulness, making presents to Brahmanas at sacrifices of every<br>kind, are duties that should be practised by every person of this class<br>who desire his own prosperity. Such a person should also perform all<br>kinds of Paka-yajnas with costly presents of food and wealth. These and<br>similar duties, O sinless one, were laid down in olden days for persons<br>of this class. All these acts which have been laid down for all others<br>should be done by persons of also the robber class, O king.'<br><br>"Mandhatri said, 'In the world of men, such wicked men may be seen living<br>in disguise among all the four orders and in all the four modes of life.'<br><br>"Indra said, 'Upon the disappearance of kingly duties and of the science<br>of chastisement, all creatures became exceedingly afflicted, O sinless<br>one, in consequence of the tyranny of kings. After the expiry of this the<br>Krita age, a confusion will set in, regarding the different modes of<br>life, and innumerable Bhikshus will appear with sectarian marks of<br>different kinds. Disregarding the Puranas and the high truths of<br>religion, men, urged by lust and wrath, will deviate into Wrong paths.<br>When sinful men are rest rained (from wicked acts) by high-souled persons<br>with the aid of the science of chastisement, then religion, which is<br>superior to everything and eternal, and which is the source of everything<br>good, becomes firmly established. The gifts, and libations, and offerings<br>to the Pitris of the man that disregards the king who is superior to<br>every one, become fruitless. The very gods do not disregard a virtuous<br>king who is truly an eternal god. The divine Lord of all creatures,<br>having created the universe, intended the Kshatriya to rule men regarding<br>their inclinations and disinclinations in respect of duties. I respect<br>and worship that person who, aided by his understanding, watches the<br>course of the duties performed by men. Upon such supervision rest<br>Kshatriya duties.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Having said these words, the divine and puissant<br>Narayana in the form of Indra, accompanied by the Maruts, repaired to his<br>eternal abode of inexhaustible felicity. When, O sinless one, duties as<br>practised by the good had such a course in days of old, what man of<br>cleansed soul and learning is there that would disregard the Kshatriya?<br>Like blind men lost on the way, creatures acting and abstaining<br>unrighteously meet with destruction. O tiger among men, do thou adhere to<br>that circle (of duties) that was first set agoing and to which the<br>ancients had recourse. I know, O sinless one, that thou art quite<br>competent to do this.'
