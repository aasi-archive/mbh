                            Vaisampayana said, "The foremost of kings, viz., Yudhishthira the son of<br>Dharma, still remaining speechless, Pandu's son Arjuna addressed Krishna<br>and spoke as follows:<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'This scorcher of foes, viz., Dharma's son, is burning with<br>grief on account of his (slaughtered) kinsfolk. Comfort him, O Madhava I<br>Once more, O Janardana, all of us have fallen into great danger. It<br>behoveth thee! O mighty-armed one, to dispel his grief.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed by the high-souled Arjuna, the<br>lotus-eyed Govinda of unfading glory turned his face towards the king.<br>Kesava could not by any means be disregarded by Yudhishthira. From the<br>earliest years Govinda was dearer to Yudhishthira than Arjuna himself.<br>Taking up the king's hand adorned with sandal-paste and looking like a<br>column of marble, the mighty-armed Saurin began to speak, gladdening (the<br>hearts of all who listened to him). His face, adorned with teeth and eyes<br>that were very beautiful, shone brightly like a full-blown lotus at<br>sunrise.<br><br>"Vasudeva said, "Do not, O tiger among men, indulge in such grief that<br>emaciates thy body. They who have been slain in this battle will on no<br>account be got back. Those Kshatriyas, O king, that have fallen in this<br>great battle, are even, like objects that one acquires in one's dreams<br>and that vanish when one awakes. All of them were heroes and ornaments of<br>battle. They were vanquished while rushing with faces towards their foes.<br>No one amongst them was slain with wounds on the back or while flying<br>away. All of them, having contended with heroes in great battle and<br>having cast off their life-breaths then, have, sanctified by weapons,<br>proceeded to heaven. It behoveth thee not to grieve for them. Devoted to<br>the duties of Kshatriyas, possessed of courage, perfectly conversant with<br>the Vedas and their branches, all of them have attained to that blissful<br>end which is obtainable by heroes. It behoveth thee not to grieve for<br>them after hearing of those high-souled lords of the earth, of ancient<br>days, that departed from this world. In this connection is cited the old<br>discourse of Narada before Srinjaya when the latter was deeply afflicted<br>with grief on account of the death of his son. (Narada said),&#8212;Subject to<br>happiness and misery, myself, thyself and all creatures, O Srinjaya,<br>shall have to die. What cause then is there for sorrow. Listen to me as I<br>recite the great blessedness of (some) ancient king. Hear me with<br>concentrated attention. Thou shalt then, O king, cast off thy grief.<br>Listening to the story of those high-souled lords of the earth, abate thy<br>sorrow. O, hear me as I recite their stories to thee in detail. By<br>listening to the charming and delightful history of those kings of<br>ancient times, malignant stars may be propitiated and the period of one's<br>life be increased. We hear, O Srinjaya, that there was a king of the name<br>of Marutta who was the son of Avikshit. Even he fell a prey to death. The<br>gods with Indra and Varuna and Vrihaspati at their head came to<br>sacrifice, called Viswasrij, performed by that high-souled monarch.[86]<br>Challenging Sakra, the chief of the gods, that king vanquished him in<br>battle. The learned Vrihaspati, from desire of doing good unto Indra, had<br>refused to officiate at Marutta's sacrifice. Thereupon Samvarta, the<br>younger brother of Vrihaspati, acceded to the king's request. During the<br>rule of that king, O best of monarchs, the earth yielded crops without<br>being tilled and was adorned with diverse kinds of ornaments. In the<br>sacrifice of that king, the Viswedevas sat as courtiers, the Maruts acted<br>as distributors (of food and presents) and the high-souled Sadhyas were<br>also present. In that sacrifice of Marutta, the Maruts drank Soma. The<br>sacrificial presents the king made surpassed (in value) those ever made<br>by the gods, the Gandharvas, and men. When even that king, O Srinjaya,<br>who transcended thee in religious merit, knowledge, renunciation, and<br>affluence, and who was purer than thy son, felt a prey to death, do not<br>grieve for thy son. There was another king of the name of Suhotra the son<br>of Atithi. We hear, O Srinjaya, that even he fell a prey to death. During<br>his rule, Maghavat showered gold for one whole year upon his kingdom.<br>Obtaining that king for her lord, the earth became in reality (and not in<br>name only as before) Vasumati.[87] The rivers, during the sway of that<br>king, bore golden tortoises, crabs, alligators, sharks, and porpoises,<br>for the adorable Indra, O king, had showered these upon them. Beholding<br>those golden fishes and sharks and tortoises in hundreds and thousands,<br>Atithi's son became filled with wonder. Collecting that vast wealth of<br>gold that covered the earth, Suhotra performed a sacrifice at Kurujangala<br>and gave it away unto the Brahmanas, When that king, O Srinjaya, who<br>transcended thee in the four attributes of religious merit, knowledge,<br>renunciation, and affluence, and who was purer than thy son, felt a prey<br>to death, do not grieve for thy son (that is dead). Thy son never<br>performed a sacrifice and never made gifts. Knowing this, pacify thy mind<br>and do not give away to grief.[88] We hear also, O Srinjaya, that<br>Vrihadratha the king of the Angas, fell a prey to death. He gave away I<br>hundred thousand steeds. A hundred thousand maidens also, adorned with<br>golden ornaments, he gave away as presents in a sacrifice he performed. A<br>hundred thousand elephants also of the best breed, he gave away as<br>presents in another sacrifice performed by him. A hundred millions also<br>of bulls, adorned with golden chains, with thousands of kine accompanying<br>them, he gave away as sacrificial presents. While the king of Anga<br>performed his sacrifice by the hill called Vishnupada, Indra became<br>intoxicated with the Soma he drank, and the Brahmanas with the presents<br>they received. In the sacrifices, O monarch, numbering by hundreds, that<br>this king performed of old, the presents he made far surpassed those ever<br>made by the gods, the Gandharvas, and men. No other man was born, or will<br>ever be born, that gave or will give away so much wealth as was given<br>away by the king of the Angas in the seven sacrifices he performed, each<br>of which was characterised by the consecration of the Soma.[89] When, O<br>Srinjaya, this Vrihadratha even, who was thy superior in the four<br>attributes and who was purer than thy son, fell a prey to death, do not<br>grieve for thy son that is dead. We hear also, O Srinjaya, that Sivi, the<br>son of Usinara, fell a prey to death. That king swayed the whole earth as<br>one sways the leathern shield in his hand. Riding on a single car that<br>proved victorious in every battle, king Sivi caused the whole earth to<br>resound with the rattle of his wheels and subjugated all monarchs.[90]<br>Usinara's son Sivi gave away, in a sacrifice, all the kine and horses he<br>had, both domestic and wild. The Creator himself thought that no one<br>amongst the kings of the past or the future had or would have the ability<br>to bear the burthen, O Srinjaya, that Usinara's son Sivi, that foremost<br>of kings, that hero who was possessed of prowess equal to that of Indra<br>himself, bore. Do not, therefore, grieve or thy son who never performed<br>any sacrifice nor made any gift. Indeed, O Srinjaya, when Sivi, who was<br>far superior to thee in the four attributes and who was purer than thy<br>son, fell a prey to death, do not grieve for thy son that is dead. We<br>hear, O Srinjaya, that the high-souled Bharata also, the son of Dushmanta<br>and Sakuntala, who had a vast and well-filled treasury, fell a prey to<br>death. Devoting three hundred horses unto the gods on the banks of the<br>Yamuna, twenty on the banks of the Saraswati, and fourteen on the banks<br>of Ganga, that king of great energy, in days of old, performed (in this<br>order) a thousand Horse-sacrifices and a hundred Rajasuyas. No one<br>amongst the kings of the earth can imitate the great deeds of Bharata,<br>even as no man can, by the might of his arms, soar into the welkin.<br>Erecting numerous sacrificial altars, he gave away innumerable horses and<br>untold wealth unto the sage Kanwa.[91] When even he, O Srinjaya, who was<br>far superior to thee in the four attributes and who was purer than thy<br>son, fell a prey to death, do not grieve for thy son that is dead. We<br>hear, O Srinjaya, that Rama also, the son of Dasaratha, fell a prey to<br>death. He always cherished his subjects as if they were the sons of his<br>own loins. In his dominions there were no widows and none that was<br>helpless. Indeed, Rama in governing his kingdom always acted like his<br>father Dasaratha. The clouds, yielding showers season ably, caused the<br>crops to grow abundantly. During the period of his rule, food was always<br>abundant in his kingdom. No death occurred by drowning or by fire. As<br>long as Rama governed it, there was no fear in his kingdom of any<br>disease. Every man lived for a thousand years, and every man was blessed<br>with a thousand children. During the period of Rama's sway, all men were<br>whole and all men attained the fruition of their wishes. The very women<br>did not quarrel with one another, what need then be said of the men?<br>During his rule his subjects were always devoted to virtue. Contented,<br>crowned with fruition in respect of all the objects of their desire,<br>fearless, free, and wedded to the vow of truth, were all the people when<br>Rama governed the kingdom. The trees always bore flowers and fruit and<br>were subject to no accidents. Every cow yielded milk filling a drona to<br>the brim. Having dwelt, in the observance of severe penances, for four<br>and ten years in the woods, Rama performed ten Horse-sacrifices of great<br>splendour[92] and to them the freest access was given to all. Possessed<br>of youth, of a dark complexion, with red eyes, he looked like the leader<br>of an elephantine herd. With aims stretching down to his knees and of<br>handsome face, his shoulders were like those of a lion and the might of<br>his arms great. Ascending upon the throne of Ayodhya, he ruled for ten<br>thousand and ten hundred years. When, he O Srinjaya, who transcended thee<br>in the four principal attributes and who was purer than thy son, fell a<br>prey to death, do not grieve for thy son that is dead. We hear, O<br>Srinjaya, that king Bhagiratha also died. In one of the sacrifices of<br>that king, intoxicated with the Soma he had drunk, Indra, the adorable<br>chastiser of Paka and the chief of the gods, vanquished, by putting forth<br>the might of his arms, many thousands of Asuras. King Bhagiratha, in one<br>of the sacrifices he performed, gave away a million of maidens adorned<br>with ornaments of gold. Each of those maidens sat upon a car and unto<br>each car were attached four steeds. With each car were a hundred<br>elephants, all of the foremost breed and decked with chains of gold.<br>Behind each elephant were a thousand steeds, and behind each steed a<br>thousand kine, and behind each cow a thousand goats and sheep. (The<br>river-goddess) Ganga, named (from before) Bhagirathi, sat upon the lap of<br>this king dwelling near (her stream), and from this incident she came to<br>be called Urvasi.[93] The triple-coursed Ganga had agreed to be the<br>daughter of Bhagiratha of Ikshvaku's race, that monarch ever engaged in<br>the performance of sacrifices with presents in profusion unto the<br>Brahmanas.[94] When he, O Srinjaya, who transcended thee in respect of<br>the four principal attributes and who was purer than thy son, fell a prey<br>to death, do not grieve for thy son. We hear, O Srinjaya, that the<br>high-souled Dilipa also fell a prey to death. The Brahmanas love to<br>recite his innumerable deeds. In one of his great sacrifices that king,<br>with heart fully assenting, gave away the entire earth, abounding with<br>wealth, unto the Brahmanas. In each sacrifice performed by him, the chief<br>priest received as sacrificial fee a thousand elephants made of gold. In<br>one of his sacrifices, the stake (set up for slaughtering the victims)<br>was made of gold and looked exceedingly beautiful. Discharging the duties<br>assigned to them, the gods having Sakra for their chief, used to seek the<br>protection of that king. Upon that golden stake possessed of great<br>effulgence and decked with a ring, six thousand Gods and Gandharvas<br>danced in joy, and Viswavasu himself, in their midst played on his Vina<br>the seven notes according to the rules that regulate their combinations.<br>Such was the character of Viswavasu's music that every creature (whatever<br>he might be) thought that the great Gandharva was playing to him alone.<br>No other monarch could imitate this achievement of king Dilipa. The<br>elephants of that king, intoxicated and adorned with housings of gold,<br>used to lie down on the roads.[95] Those men proceeded to heaven that<br>succeeded in obtaining a sight even of the high-souled king Dilipa who<br>was ever truthful in speech and whose bow could bear a hundred foes equal<br>in energy to a hundred Anantas.[96] These three sounds never ceased in<br>Dilipa's abode, viz., the voice of Vedic recitations, the twang of bows,<br>and cries of Let it be given. When he, O Srinjaya, who transcended thee<br>in the four principal attributes and who was purer than thy son, fell a<br>prey to death, do not grieve for thy son that is dead. Yuvanaswa's son<br>Mandhatri also, O Sanjaya, we have heard, fell a prey to death. The<br>deities named Maruts extracted that child from his sire's stomach through<br>one of its sides. Sprung from a quantity of clarified butter that had<br>been sanctified by mantras (and that had by mistake been quaffed by his<br>sire instead of his sire's spouse) Mandhatri was born in the stomach of<br>the high-souled Yuvanaswa. Possessed of great prosperity, king Mandhatri<br>conquered the three worlds. Beholding that child of celestial beauty<br>lying on the lap of his sire, the God asked one another, 'From whom shall<br>this child obtain suck?' Then Indra approached him, saying, 'He shall<br>obtain stick even from me!' From this circumstance, the chief of the<br>deities came to call the child by the name of Mandhatri.[97] From the<br>nourishment of that high-souled child of Yuvanaswa, the finger of Indra,<br>placed in his mouth, began to yield a jet of milk. Sucking Indra's<br>finger, he grew up into a stout youth in a hundred days, In twelve days<br>he looked like one of twelve years. The whole earth in one day came under<br>the sway of that high-souled and virtuous and brave king who resembled<br>Indra himself for prowess in battle. He vanquished king Angada, Marutta,<br>Asita, Gaya, and Vrihadratha the king of the Angas.[98] When Yuvanaswa's<br>son fought in battle with Angada, the Gods thought that the firmament was<br>breaking with the twang of his how. The whole earth from where the Sun<br>rises to where he sets is said to be the field of Mandhatri. Having<br>performed Horse-sacrifices and a hundred Rajasuyas, he gave unto the<br>Brahmanas many Rohita fishes. Those fishes were each ten Yojanas in<br>length and one in breadth. Those that remained after gratifying the<br>Brahmanas were divided amongst themselves by the other classes. When he,<br>O Srinjaya, who transcended thee in respect of the four principal<br>attributes and who was purer than thy son, fell a prey to death, do not<br>grieve for thy son that is dead. We hear, O Sanjaya, that Yayati, the son<br>of Nahusha, also fell a prey to death. Having subjugated the whole world<br>with its seas, he journeyed through it, decking it with successive<br>sacrificial altars the intervals between which were measured by throws of<br>a heavy piece of wood. Indeed, he reached the very shores of the sea as<br>he proceeded performing great sacrifices (on those altars along his<br>way).[99] Having performed a thousand sacrifices and a hundred Vajapeyas,<br>he gratified the foremost of Brahmanas with three mountains of gold.<br>Having slain many Daityas and Danavas duly arrayed in battle, Nahusha's<br>son, Yayati, divided the whole earth (among his children). At last<br>discarding his other sons headed by Yadu and Drahyu, he installed (his<br>youngest son) Puru on his throne and then entered the woods accompanied<br>by his wife, When he, O Srinjaya, who far surpassed thee in the four<br>principal attributes and who was purer than thy son, fell a prey to<br>death, do not grieve for thy son that is dead. We hear, O Srinjaya, that<br>Amvarisha also, the son of Nabhaga, fell a prey to death. That protector<br>(of the world) and foremost of kings was regarded by his subjects as the<br>embodiment of virtue. That monarch, in one of his sacrifices, assigned to<br>the Brahmanas, for waiting upon them, a million of kings who had<br>themselves performed thousands of sacrifices each. Men of piety praised<br>Amvarisha, the son of Nabhaga, saying that such feats had never been<br>achieved before nor would their like be achieved in the future.[100]<br>Those hundreds upon hundreds and thousands upon thousands of kings (that<br>had at the command of Amvarisha waited at his sacrifices upon the<br>Brahmanas that came there) became (through Amvarisha's merits) crowned<br>with the fruits of the Horse-sacrifice, and followed their lord by the<br>Southern-path (to regions or brightness and bliss). When he, O Srinjaya,<br>who far surpassed thee in the four principal attributes and who was purer<br>than thy son, fell a prey to death, do not grieve for thy child that is<br>dead. We hear, O Srinjaya, that Sasavindu also, the son of Chitrasena,<br>felt a prey to death. That high-souled king had a hundred thousand wives,<br>and million of sorts. All of them used to wear golden armour and all of<br>them were excellent bowmen. Each of those princes married a hundred<br>princesses, and each princess brought a hundred elephants. With each of<br>those elephants were a hundred cars. With each car were a hundred steeds,<br>all of good breed and all decked with trappings of gold. With each steed<br>were a hundred kine, and with each cow were a hundred sheep and goats.<br>This countless wealth, O monarch, Sasavindu gave away, in a<br>Horse-sacrifice, unto the Brahmanas. When he, O Srinjaya, who far<br>surpassed thee in the four principal attributes and who was purer than<br>thy son, fell a prey to death, do not grieve for thy child that is dead.<br>We hear, O Srinjaya, that Gaya also, the son of Amurtarayas, fell a prey<br>to death. For a hundred years, that king subsisted upon the remains of<br>sacrificial food. (Pleased with such devotion) Agni desired to give him<br>boons. The boons solicited by Gaya were, 'Let my wealth be inexhaustible<br>even if I give ceaselessly. Let my regard for virtue exist for ever. Let<br>my heart ever take pleasure in Truth, through thy grace, O cater of<br>sacrificial libations.' It hath been heard by us that king Gaya obtained<br>all those wishes from Agni. On days of the new moon, on those of the full<br>moon, and on every fourth month, for a thousand years, Gaya repeatedly<br>performed the Horse-sacrifice. Rising (at the completion of every<br>sacrifice) he gave away a hundred thousand kine and hundreds of mules<br>(unto the Brahmanas) during this period. That bull among men gratified<br>the gods with Soma, the Brahmanas with wealth, the Pitris with Swadha,<br>and the women with the accomplishment of all their wishes. In his great<br>Horse-sacrifice, king Gaya caused a golden ground to be made, measuring a<br>hundred cubits in length and fifty in breadth, and gave it away as the<br>sacrificial fee. That foremost of men, viz., Gaya, the son of<br>Amurtarayas, gave away as many kine as there are sand grains, O king, in<br>the river Ganga. When he, O Srinjaya, who far surpassed thee in the four<br>principal attributes and who was purer than thy son, fell a prey to<br>death, do not grieve for thy son that is dead. We hear, O Srinjaya, that<br>Sankriti's son Rantideva also fell a prey to death. Having undergone the<br>austerest of penances and adored him with great reverence, he obtained<br>these boons from Sakra, having solicited them, saying 'Let us have<br>abundant food and numerous guests. Let not my faith sustain any<br>diminution, and let us not have to ask anything of any person.' The<br>animals, both domestic and wild, slaughtered in his sacrifice, used to<br>come to him, viz., the high-souled Rantideva of rigid vows and great<br>fame, of their own accord. The secretions that flowed from the skins of<br>the animals (slaughtered in his sacrifices), produced a mighty and<br>celebrated river which to this day is known by the name of Charmanwati.<br>King Rantideva used to make gifts unto the Brahmanas in an extensive<br>enclosure. When the king said, 'Unto thee I give a hundred nishkas! Unto<br>thee I give a hundred,' the Brahmanas (without accepting what was<br>offered) made a noise (expressive of refusal). When, however, the king<br>would say, 'I give a thousand nishkas,' the gifts were all accepted. All<br>the vessels and plates, in Rantideva's palace, for holding food and other<br>articles, all the jugs and pots, the pans and plates and cups, were of<br>gold. On those nights during which the guests used to live in Rantideva's<br>abode, twenty thousand and one hundred kine had to be slaughtered. Yet<br>even on such occasions, the cooks, decked in ear-rings, used to proclaim<br>(amongst those that sat down to supper): 'There is abundant soup, take as<br>much as ye wish; but of flesh we have not as much today as on former<br>occasions.' When he, O Srinjaya, who far surpassed thee in the four<br>principal attributes and who was purer than thy son, fell a prey to<br>death, do not grieve for thy son that is dead. We hear, O Srinjaya, that<br>the high-souled Sagara also fell a prey to death. He was of Ikshvaku's<br>race, a tiger among men, and of superhuman prowess. Sixty thousand sons<br>used to walk behind him, like myriads upon myriads of stars waiting upon<br>the Moon in the cloudless firmament of autumn. His sway extended over the<br>whole of this earth.[101] He gratified the gods by performing a thousand<br>Horse-sacrifices. He gave away unto deserving Brahmanas palatial mansions<br>with columns of gold and (other parts) made entirely of that precious<br>metal, containing costly beds and bevies of beautiful ladies with eyes<br>resembling petals of the lotus, and diverse other kinds of valuable<br>objects. At his command, the Brahmanas divided those gifts among<br>themselves. Through anger that king caused the earth to be excavated<br>whereupon she came to have the ocean on her bosom, and for this, the<br>ocean has come to be called Sagara after his name. When he, O Srinjaya,<br>who far surpassed thee in the four principal attributes and who was purer<br>than thy son, fell a prey to death, do not grieve for thy son that is<br>dead. We hear, O Srinjaya, that king Prithu also, the son of Vena, fell a<br>prey to death. The great Rishis, assembling together in the great forest,<br>installed him in the sovereignty of the earth. And because it was thought<br>that he would advance all mankind, he was, for that reason, called Prithu<br>(the advancer). And because also he protected people from injuries<br>(Kshata), he was, for that reason, called a Kshatriya (protector from<br>injuries). Beholding Prithu the son of Vena, all the creatures of the<br>earth exclaimed, 'We have been lovingly attached to him.' From this<br>circumstance of the loving attachment (to him of all creatures), he came<br>to be called a Raja (one that can inspire attachment). The earth, during<br>his sway, yielded crops without being tilled, every leaf that the trees<br>had bore honey; and every cow yielded a jugful of milk. All men were hale<br>and all their wishes used to be crowned with fruition. They had no fear<br>of any kind. They used to live, as they pleased, in fields or in<br>(sheltered) houses. When Prithu desired to go over the sea, the waters<br>became solidified. The rivers also never swelled up when he had to cross<br>them but remained perfectly calm. The standard on his car moved freely<br>everywhere (without being obstructed by any impediment). King Prithu, in<br>one of his grand Horse-sacrifices, gave away unto the Brahman as one and<br>twenty mountains of gold, each measuring three nalwas.[102] When he, O<br>Srinjaya, who far surpassed thee in the four principal attributes and who<br>was purer than thy son, fell a prey to death, do not grieve for thy son<br>that is dead. Upon what, O Srinjaya, dost thou reflect in silence? It<br>seems, O king, that thou hearest not these words of mine. If thou hast<br>not heard them, then this discourse of mine has been a fruitless<br>rhapsody, like medicine or diet, to a person on the point of death.'<br><br>"Srinjaya said, 'I am attending, O Narada, to this discourse of thine, of<br>excellent import and perfumed like a garland of flowers,&#8212;this discourse<br>upon the conduct of high-souled royal sages of meritorious deeds and<br>great fame, that can certainly dispel grief. Thy discourse, O great sage,<br>has not been a fruitless rhapsody. I have been freed from grief at thy<br>very sight. Like one never satiated with drinking nectar, I am not<br>satiated with thy words. O thou of true sight, if thou, O lord, be<br>inclined to show thy grace towards this person burning on account of the<br>death of his son, then that son, through that grace of thine, is sure to<br>be revived and to mingle once more with me (in this life).<br><br>"Narada said, 'I will give back to thee that son of thine, named<br>Suvarnashthivin, whom Parvata gave thee and who has been bereft of life.<br>Of the splendour of gold, that child shall have a thousand years.'"
