                            Janamejaya said, "O regenerate one, are there many Purushas or is there<br>only one? Who, in the universe, is the foremost of Purushas? What, again,<br>is said to be the source of all things?"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, In the speculations of the Sankhya and the Yoga<br>systems many Purushas have been spoken of, O jewel of Kuru's race. Those<br>that follow these systems do not accept that there is but one Purusha in<br>the universe.[1916] In the same manner in which the many Purushas are<br>said to have one origin in the Supreme Purusha, it may be said that this<br>entire universe is identical with that one Purusha of superior<br>attributes. I shall explain this now, after bowing to my preceptor Vyasa,<br>that foremost of Rishis, who is conversant with the soul, endued with<br>penances, self-restrained, and worthy of reverent worship. This<br>speculation on Purusha, O king, occurs in all the Vedas. It is well known<br>to be identical with Rita and Truth. The foremost of Rishis, viz., Vyasa,<br>has thought upon it. Having occupied themselves with reflection on what<br>is called Adhyatma, diverse Rishis, O king, having Kapila for their<br>first, have declared their opinions on the topic both generally and<br>particularly. Through the grace of Vyasa of immeasurable energy, I shall<br>expound to thee what Vyasa has said in brief on this question of the<br>Oneness of Purusha. In this connection is cited the old narrative of the<br>discourse between Brahma, O king, and the Three-eyed Mahadeva. In the<br>midst of the Ocean of milk, there is a very high mountain of great<br>effulgence like that of gold, known, O monarch, by the name of<br>Vaijayanta. Repairing thither all alone, from his own abode of great<br>splendour and felicity, the illustrious deity Brahma used very often to<br>pass his time, engaged in thinking on the course of Adhyatma. While the<br>four-faced Brahma of great intelligence was seated there, his son<br>Mahadeva, who had sprung from his forehead encountered him one day in<br>course of his wanderings through the universe. In days of yore, the<br>Three-eyed Siva endued with puissance and high Yoga, while proceeding<br>along the sky, beheld Brahma seated on that mountain and, therefore,<br>dropped down quickly on its top. With a cheerful heart he presented him<br>before his progenitor and worshipped his feet. Beholding Mahadeva<br>prostrated at his feet, Brahma took him up with his left hand. Having<br>thus raised Mahadeva up, Brahma, that puissant and one Lord of all<br>creatures, then addressed his son, whom he met after a long time, in<br>these words.<br><br>"The Grandsire said, 'Welcome art thou, O thou of mighty arms. By good<br>luck I see thee after such a long time come to my presence. I hope, O<br>son, that everything is right with thy penances and thy Vedic studies and<br>recitations. Thou art always observant of the austerest penances. Hence I<br>ask thee about the progress and well-being of those penances of thine!'<br><br>"Rudra said, 'O illustrious one, through thy grace, all is well with my<br>penances and Vedic studies. It is all right, again, with the universe. I<br>saw thy illustrious self a long while ago in thy own home of felicity and<br>effulgence. I am coming thence to this mountain that is now the abode of<br>thy feet.[1917] Great is the curiosity excited in my mind by this<br>withdrawal of thyself into such a lone spot from thy usual region of<br>felicity and splendour. Great must the reason be, O Grandsire, for such<br>an act on thy part. Thy own foremost abode is free from the pains of<br>hunger and thirst, and inhabited by both deities and Asuras, by Rishis of<br>immeasurable splendour, as also by Gandharvas and Apsaras. Abandoning<br>such a spot of felicity, thou residest alone in this foremost of<br>mountains. The cause of this cannot but be grave.<br><br>"Brahma said, 'This foremost of mountains, called Vaijayanta, is always<br>my residence. Here, with concentrated mind, I meditate on the one<br>universal Purusha of infinite proportions.'<br><br>"Rudra said, 'Self-born thou art. Many are the Purushas that have been<br>created by thee. Others again, O Brahma, are being created by thee. The<br>Infinite Purusha, however, of whom thou speakest, is one and single. Who<br>is that foremost of Purushas, O Brahma, that is being meditated by thee?<br>Great is the curiosity I feel on this point. Do thou kindly dispel the<br>doubt that has taken possession of my mind.<br><br>"Brahma said, 'O son, many are those Purushas of whom thou speakest. The<br>one Purusha, however, of whom I am thinking, transcends all Purushas and<br>is invisible. The many Purushas that exist in the universe have that one<br>Purusha as their basis; and since that one Purushas is said to be the<br>source whence all the innumerable Purushas have sprung, hence all the<br>latter, if they succeed in divesting themselves of attributes, become<br>competent to enter into that one Purusha who is identified with the<br>universe, who is supreme, who is the foremost of the foremost, who is<br>eternal, and who is himself divested of and is above all attributes."
