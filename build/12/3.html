                            "Narada said, 'That tiger of Bhrigu's race (viz., Rama), was well-pleased<br>with the might of Karna's arms, his affection (for him), his<br>self-restraint, and the services he did unto his preceptor. Observant of<br>ascetic penances, Rama cheerfully communicated, with due forms, unto his<br>penance-observing disciple, everything about the Brahma weapon with the<br>mantras for withdrawing it. Having acquired a knowledge of that weapon,<br>Karna began to pass his days happily in Bhrigu's retreat, and endued with<br>wonderful prowess, he devoted himself with great ardour to the science of<br>weapons. One day Rama of great intelligence, while roving with Karna in<br>the vicinity or his retreat, felt very weak in consequence of the fasts<br>he had undergone. From affection begotten by confidence, the tired son of<br>Jamadagni placing his head on Karna's lap, slept soundly, White his<br>preceptor was thus sleeping (with head) on his lap, a frightful worm,<br>whose bite was very painful and which subsisted on phlegm and fat and<br>flesh and blood, approached the presence of Karna. That blood-sucking<br>worm, approaching Karna's thigh, began to pierce it. Through fear of<br>(awaking) his preceptor, Karna became unable to either throw away or kill<br>that worm. Though his limb was bored through by that worm, O Bharata, the<br>son of Surya, lest his preceptor should awake, suffered it to do its<br>pleasure. Though the pain was intolerable, Karna bore it with heroic<br>patience, and continued to hold Bhrigu's son on his lap, without<br>quivering in the least and without manifesting any sign of pain. When at<br>last Karna's blood touched the body of Rama of great energy, the latter<br>awoke and said these words in fear, 'Alas, I have been made impure! What<br>is this that thou art doing, Tell me, casting off all fear, what is the<br>truth of this matter!' Then Karna informed him of that worm's bite. Rama<br>saw that worm which resembled a hog in shape. It had eight feet and very<br>keen teeth, and it was covered with bristles that were all pointed like<br>needles. Called by the name of Alarka, its limbs were then shrunk (with<br>fear). As soon as Rama cast his, eyes on it, the worm gave up its<br>life-breath, melting in that blood which it had drawn. All this seemed<br>wonderful. Then in the welkin was seen a Rakshasa of terrible form, dark<br>in hue, of a red neck, capable of assuming any form at wilt, and staying<br>on the clouds,&#8212;his object fulfilled, the Rakshasa, with joined hands,<br>addressed Rama, saying, 'O best of ascetics, thou hast rescued me from<br>this hell! Blessed be thou, I adore thee, thou hast done me good!'<br>Possessed of great energy, the mighty-armed son of Jamadagni said unto<br>him, 'Who art thou? And why also didst thou fall into hell? Tell me all<br>about it.' He answered, 'Formerly I was a great Asura of the name of<br>Dansa. In the Krita period, O sire, I was of the same age with Bhrigu. I<br>ravished the dearly-loved spouse of that sage. Through his curse I felt<br>down on the earth in the form of a worm. In anger thy ancestors said unto<br>me, 'Subsisting on urine and phlegm, O wretch, thou shalt lead a life of<br>hell.' I then besought him, saying, 'When, O Brahmana, shall this curse<br>end?' Bhrigu replied unto me, saying. 'This curse shall end through Rama<br>of my race. It was for this that I had obtained such a course of life<br>like one of uncleansed soul. O righteous one, by thee, however, I have<br>been rescued from that sinful life.' Having said these words, the great<br>Asura, bending his head unto Rama went away. Then Rama wrathfully<br>addressed Karna, saying, 'O fool, no Brahmana could endure such agony.<br>Thy patience is like that of a Kshatriya. Tell me the truth, without<br>fear.' Thus asked, Karna, fearing to be cursed, and seeking to gratify<br>him, said these words, 'O thou of Bhrigu's race, know me for a Suta, a<br>race that has sprung from the intermixture of Brahmanas with Kshatriyas.<br>People call me Karna the son of Radha. O thou of Bhrigu's race, be<br>gratified with my poor self that has acted from the desire of obtaining<br>weapons. There is no doubt in this that a reverend preceptor in the Vedas<br>and other branches of knowledge is one's father. It was for this that I<br>introduced myself to thee as a person of thy own race.' Unto the<br>cheerless and trembling Karna, prostrated with joined hands upon earth,<br>that foremost one of Bhrigu's race, smiling though filled with wrath,<br>answered, 'Since thou hast, from avarice of weapons, behaved here with<br>falsehood, therefore, O wretch, this Brahma weapon shalt not dwell in thy<br>remembrance[2]. Since thou art not a Brahmana, truly this Brahma weapon<br>shall not, up to the time of thy death, dwell in thee when thou shalt be<br>engaged with a warrior equal to thyself![3] Go hence, this is no place<br>for a person of such false behaviour as thou! On earth, no Kshatriya will<br>be thy equal in battle.' Thus addressed by Rama, Karna came away, having<br>duty taken his leave. Arriving then before Duryodhana, he informed him,<br>saying, 'I have mastered all weapons!'"
