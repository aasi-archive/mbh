                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Of what behaviour must a man be, of what acts, of<br>what kind of knowledge, and to what must he be devoted, for attaining to<br>Brahma's place which transcends Prakriti and which is unchangeable?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'One that is devoted to the religion of Emancipation,<br>frugal in fare, and the master of one's senses, attains to that high<br>place which transcends Prakriti and is unchangeable.[1331] Retiring from<br>one's home, regarding gain and loss in the same light, restraining the<br>senses, and disregarding all objects of desire even when they are ready<br>(for enjoyment), one should adopt a life of Renunciation.[1332] Neither<br>with eye, nor with word, nor in thought, should one disparage another.<br>Nor should one speak evil of any person either in or out of his hearing.<br>One should abstain from injuring any creature, and conduct oneself<br>observing the course of the Sun.[1333] Having come into this life, one<br>should not behave with unfriendliness towards any creature. One should<br>disregard opprobrious speeches, and never in arrogance deem oneself as<br>superior to another. When sought to be angered by another, one should<br>still utter agreeable speeches. Even when calumniated, one should not<br>calumniate in return. One should not behave in a friendly or an<br>unfriendly way in the midst of human beings. One should not go about<br>visiting many houses in one's round of mendicancy. Nor should one go to<br>any house having received a previous invitation (to dinner).[1334] Even<br>when bespattered with filth (by others), one should, resting firmly in<br>the observance of one's duties, refrain from addressing such bespatterers<br>in disagreeable speeches. One should be compassionate. One should abstain<br>from returning an injury. One should be fearless; one should refrain from<br>self-laudation. The man of restrained senses should seek his dole of<br>charity in a householder's abode when the smoke has ceased to rise from<br>it, when the sound of the husking rod is hushed, when the hearth-fire is<br>extinguished, when all the inmates have finished their meals, or when the<br>hour is over for setting the dishes.[1335] He should content himself with<br>only as much as is barely necessary for keeping body and soul together.<br>Even that much of food which produces gratification should not be coveted<br>by him. When he fails to obtain what he wants, he should not suffer<br>himself to cherish discontent. Success, again, in obtaining what he<br>wants, should not make him glad.[1336] He should never wish for such<br>things as are coveted by ordinary men. He should never eat at anybody's<br>house when respectfully invited thereto. One like him should reprobate<br>such gains as are obtained with honour.[1337] He should never find fault<br>(on account of staleness, etc.) with the food placed before him, nor<br>should he applaud its merits. He should covet a bed and a seat that are<br>removed from the haunts of men. The places he should seek are such as a<br>deserted house, the foot of a tree, a forest, or a cave. Without allowing<br>his practices to be known by others, or concealing their real nature by<br>appearing to adopt others (that are hateful or repulsive), he should<br>enter his own Self.[1338] By association with Yoga and dissociation from<br>company, he should be perfectly equable, steadily fixed, and uniform. He<br>should not earn either merit or demerit by means of acts.[1339] He should<br>be always gratified, well-contented, of cheerful face and cheerful<br>senses, fearless, always engaged in mental recitation of sacred mantras,<br>silent, and wedded to a life of Renunciation. Beholding the repeated<br>formation and dissolution of his own body with the senses that result<br>from and resolve into the elemental essences, and seeing also the advent<br>and departure of (other) creatures, he should become free from desire and<br>learn to cast equal eyes upon all, subsisting upon both cooked and<br>uncooked food. Frugal in respect of his fare, and subjugating his senses,<br>he achieves tranquillity of Self by Self.[1340] One should control the<br>(rising) impulses of words, of the mind, of wrath, of envy, of hunger,<br>and of lust. Devoted to penances for cleansing his heart, he should never<br>allow the censures (of others) to afflict his heart. One should live,<br>having assumed a status of neutrality with respect to all creatures, and<br>regard praise and blame as equal. This, indeed, is the holiest and the<br>highest path of the Sannyasa mode of life. Possessed of high soul, the<br>Sannyasin should restrain his senses from all things and keep himself<br>aloof from all attachments. He should never repair to the places visited<br>by him and the men known to him while leading the prior modes of life.<br>Agreeable to all creatures, and without a fixed home, he should be<br>devoted to the contemplation of Self. He should never mingle with<br>house-holders and forest-recluses. He should eat such food as he may<br>obtain without effort (and without having thought of it<br>beforehand).[1341] He should never suffer joy to possess his heart. To<br>those that are wise such a life of Renunciation is the means for the<br>attainment of Emancipation. To those, however, that are fools the<br>practice of these duties is exceedingly burthensome. The sage Harita<br>declared all this to be the path by which Emancipation is to be achieved.<br>He who sets forth from his home, having assured all creatures of his<br>perfect harmlessness, attains to many bright regions of felicity which<br>prove unending or eternal.'"
