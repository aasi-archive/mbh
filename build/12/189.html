                            "Bharadwaja said, 'By what acts does one become a Brahmana? By what, a<br>Kshatriya? O best of regenerate ones, by what acts again does one become<br>a Vaisya or a Sudra? Tell me this, O foremost of speakers.'<br><br>"Bhrigu said, 'That person is called a Brahmana who has been sanctified<br>by such rites as those called jata and others; who is pure in behaviour;<br>who is engaged in studying the Vedas; who is devoted to the six<br>well-known acts (of ablutions every morning and evening, silent<br>recitation of mantras, pouring libations on the sacrificial fire,<br>worshipping the deities, doing the duties of hospitality to guests, and<br>offering food to the Viswedevas); who is properly observant of all pious<br>acts; who never takes food without having offered it duly to gods and<br>guests; who is filled with reverence for his preceptor; and who is always<br>devoted to vows and truth. He is called a Brahmana in whom are truth,<br>gifts, abstention from injury to others, compassion, shame,<br>benevolence,[564] and penance. He who is engaged in the profession of<br>battle, who studies the Vedas, who makes gifts (to Brahmanas) and takes<br>wealth (from those he protects) is called a Kshatriya. He who earns fame<br>from keep of cattle, who is employed in agriculture and the means of<br>acquiring wealth, who is pure in behaviour and attends to the study of<br>the Vedas, is called a Vaisya.[565] He who takes pleasure in eating every<br>kind of food, who is engaged in doing every kind of work, who is impure<br>in behaviour, who does not study the Vedas, and whose conduct is unclean,<br>is said to be a Sudra. If these characteristics be observable in a Sudra,<br>and if they be not found in a Brahmana, then such a Sudra is no Sudra,<br>and, such a Brahmana is no Brahmana. By every means should cupidity and<br>wrath be restrained. This as also self-restraint, are the highest results<br>of Knowledge. Those two passions (viz., cupidity and wrath), should, with<br>one's whole heart, be resisted. They make their appearance for destroying<br>one's highest good. One should always protect one's prosperity from one's<br>wrath, one's penances from pride; one's knowledge from honour and<br>disgrace; and one's soul from error. That intelligent person, O<br>regenerate one, who does all acts without desire of fruit, whose whole<br>wealth exists for charity, and who performs the daily Homa, is a real<br>Renouncer.[566] One should conduct oneself as a friend to all creatures,<br>abstaining from all acts of injury. Rejecting the acceptance of all<br>gifts, one should, by the aid of one's own intelligence, be a complete<br>master of one's passions. One should live in one's soul where there can<br>be no grief. One would then have no fear here and attain to a fearless<br>region hereafter. One should live always devoted to penances, and with<br>all passions completely restrained; observing the vow of taciturnity, and<br>with soul concentrated on itself; desirous of conquering the unconquered<br>senses, and unattached in the midst of attachments. All things that can<br>be perceived by the senses are called Manifest. All, however, that is<br>Unmanifest, that is beyond the ken of the senses, that can be ascertained<br>only by the subtile senses, should be sought to be known.[567] If there<br>be no faith, one will never succeed in attaining to that subtile sense.<br>Therefore, one should hold oneself in faith. The mind should be united<br>with Prana, and Prana should then be held within Brahma. By dissociating<br>oneself from all attachments, one may obtain absorption into Brahma.<br>There is no need of attending to any other thing. A Brahmana can easily<br>attain to Brahma by the path of Renunciation. The indications of a<br>Brahmana are purity, good behaviour and compassion unto all creatures.'"
