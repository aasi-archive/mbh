                            "Bhishma said, 'Thinking of Emancipation, Suka approached his sire and<br>possessed as he was of humility and desirous of achieving his highest<br>good, he saluted his great preceptor and said,&#8212;Thou art well versed in<br>the religion of Emancipation. Do thou O illustrious one, discourse to me<br>upon it, so that supreme tranquillity of mind, O puissant one, may be<br>mine!&#8212;Hearing these words of his son, the great Rishi said unto him,&#8212;Do<br>thou study, O son, the religion of Emancipation and all the diverse<br>duties of life!&#8212;At the command of his sire, Suka, that foremost of all<br>righteous men, mastered all the treatises on Yoga, O Bharata. as also the<br>science promulgated by Kapila. When Vyasa behind his son to be possessed<br>of the resplendence of the Vedas, endued with the energy of Brahma, and<br>fully conversant with the religion of Emancipation, he addressed him,<br>saying,&#8212;Go thou to Janaka the ruler of Mithila. The king of Mithila will<br>tell thee everything for thy Emancipation.&#8212;Bearing the command of his<br>sire, O king, Suka proceeded to Mithila for enquiring of its king about<br>the truth of duties and the Refuge of Emancipation. Before he set out,<br>his sire further told him,&#8212;Do thou go thither by that path which<br>ordinary human beings take. Do not have recourse to thy Yoga-puissance<br>for proceeding through the skies&#8212;At this Suka was not at all surprised<br>(for he was humble by nature). He was further told that he should proceed<br>thither with simplicity and not from desire of pleasure.&#8212;Along your way<br>do not seek for friends and spouses, since friends and spouses are causes<br>of attachment to the world. Although the ruler of Mithila is one in whose<br>sacrifices we officiate, still thou shouldst not indulge in any feeling<br>of superiority while living with him. Thou shouldst live under his<br>direction and in obedience to him. Even he will dispel all thy<br>doubts.[1738] That king is well versed in all duties and well acquainted<br>with the scriptures on Emancipation. He is one for whom I officiate in<br>sacrifices. Thou shouldst, without any scruple, do what he bids.&#8212;Thus<br>instructed, the righteous-souled Suka proceeded to Mithila on foot<br>although he was able to traverse through the skies over the whole Earth<br>with her seas. Crossing many hills and mountains, many rivers, many<br>waters and lakes, and many woods and forests abounding with beasts of<br>prey and other animals, crossing, the two Varshas of Meru and Hari<br>successively and next the Varsha of Himavat, he came at last to the<br>Varsha known by the name of Bharata. Having seen many countries inhabited<br>by Chins and Huns, the great ascetic at last reached Aryavarta. In<br>obedience to the commands of his sire and bearing them constantly in his<br>mind, he gradually passed along his way on the Earth like a bird passing<br>through the air. Passing through many delightful towns and populous<br>cities, he saw diverse kinds of wealth without waiting to observe them.<br>On his way he passed through many delightful gardens and planes and many<br>sacred waters. Before much time had passed he reached the country of the<br>Videhas that was protected by the virtuous and high-souled Janaka. There<br>he beheld many populous villages, and many kinds of food and drink and<br>viands and habitations of cowherds swelling with men and many herds of<br>cattle. He beheld many fields abounding with paddy and barley and other<br>grain, and many lakes and waters inhabited by swans and cranes and<br>adorned with beautiful lotuses. Passing through the Videha country<br>teeming with well-to-do people, he arrived at the delightful gardens of<br>Mithila rich with many species of trees. Abounding with elephants and<br>horses and cars, and peopled by men and women, he passed through them<br>without waiting to observe any of the things that were presented to his<br>eye. Bearing that burthen in his mind and ceaselessly dwelling upon it<br>(viz., the desire of mastering the religion of Emancipation), Suka of<br>cheerful soul and taking delight in internal survey only, reached Mithila<br>at last. Arrived at the gate, he sent word through the keepers. Endued<br>with tranquillity of mind, devoted to contemplation and Yoga, he entered<br>the city, having obtained permission. Proceeding along the principal<br>street abounding with well-to-do men, he reached the king's palace and<br>entered it without any scruples. The porters forbade him with rough<br>words. Thereat, Suka, without any anger, stopped and waited. Neither the<br>sun nor the long distance he had walked had fatigued him in the least.<br>Neither hunger, nor thirst, nor the exertion he had made, had weakened<br>him. The heat of the Sun had not scorched or pained or distressed him in<br>any degree. Among those porters there was one who felt compassion for<br>him, beholding him staying there like the midday Sun in his effulgence.<br>Worshipping him in due form and saluting him properly, with joined hands<br>he led him to the first chamber of the palace. Seated there, Suka, O son,<br>began to think of Emancipation only. Possessed of equable splendour he<br>looked with an equal eye upon a shaded spot and one exposed to the Sun's<br>rays. Very soon after, the king's minister, coming to that place with<br>joined hands, led him to the second chamber of the palace. That chamber<br>led to a spacious garden which formed a portion of the inner apartments<br>of the palace. It looked like a second Chaitraratha. Beautiful pieces of<br>water occurred here and there at regular intervals. Delightful trees, all<br>of which were in their flowering season, stood in that garden. Bevies of<br>damsels, of transcendent beauty, were in attendance. The minister led<br>Suka from the second chamber to that delightful spot. Ordering those<br>damsels to give the ascetic a seat, the minister left him there. Those<br>well-dressed damsels were of beautiful features, possessed of excellent<br>hips, young in years, clad in red robes of fine texture, and decked with<br>many ornaments of burnished gold. They were well-skilled in agreeable<br>conversation and maddening revelry, and thorough mistresses of the arts<br>of dance and singing. Always opening their lips with smiles, they were<br>equal to the very Apsaras in beauty. Well-skilled in all the acts of<br>dalliance, competent to read the thoughts of men upon whom they wait,<br>possessed of every accomplishment, fifty damsels, of a very superior<br>order and of easy virtue, surrounded the ascetic. Presenting him with<br>water for washing his feet, and worshipping him respectfully with the<br>offer of the usual articles, they gratified him with excellent viands<br>agreeable to the season. After he had eaten, those damsels then, one<br>after another, singly led him through the grounds, showing him every<br>object of interest, O Bharata. Sporting and laughing and singing, those<br>damsels, conversant with the thoughts of all men, entertained that<br>auspicious ascetic of noble soul. The pure-souled ascetic born in the<br>fire-sticks, observant without scruples of any kind of his duties, having<br>all his senses under complete control, and a thorough master of his<br>wrath, was neither pleased nor angered at all this. Then those foremost<br>of beautiful women gave him an excellent seat. Washing his feet and other<br>limbs, Suka said his evening prayers, sat on that excellent seat, and<br>began to think of the object for which he had come there. In the first<br>part of the night, he devoted himself to Yoga. The puissant ascetic,<br>passed the middle portion of the night in sleep. Very soon waking up from<br>his slumber, he went through the necessary rites of cleansing his body,<br>and though surrounded by those beautiful women, he once again devoted<br>himself to Yoga. It was in this way, O Bharata, that the son of the<br>Island-born Krishna passed the latter part of that day and the whole of<br>that night in the palace of king Janaka.'"
