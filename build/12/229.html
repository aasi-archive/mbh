                            "Yudhishthira said, 'By what disposition, what course of duties, what<br>knowledge, and what energy, does one succeed in attaining to Brahma which<br>is immutable and which is beyond the reach of primordial nature.'[866]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'One that is engaged in the practice of the religion of<br>nivritti, that eats abstemiously, and that has his senses under complete<br>control, can attain to Brahma which is immutable and which is above<br>primordial nature. In this connection is cited the old narrative, O<br>Bharata, of the discourse between Jaigishavya and Asita. Once on a time<br>Asita-Devala addressed Jaigishavya who was possessed of great wisdom and<br>fully acquainted with the truths of duty and morality.'<br><br>"Devala said, 'Thou art not gladdened when praised. Thou dost not give<br>way to wrath when blamed or censured. What, indeed, is thy wisdom? Whence<br>hast thou got it? And what, indeed, is the refuge of that wisdom?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Thus questioned by Devala, the pure Jaigishavya of<br>austere penances, said those words of high import, fraught with full<br>faith and profound sense.'<br><br>"Jaigishavya said, 'O foremost of Rishis, I shall tell thee of that which<br>is the highest end, that which is the supreme goal, that which is<br>tranquillity, in the estimation of all persons of righteous acts. They, O<br>Devala, who behave uniformly towards those that praise them and those<br>that blame them, they who conceal their own vows and good acts, they who<br>never indulge in recriminations, they who never say even what is good<br>when it is calculated to injure (instead of producing any benefit), they<br>who do not desire to return injury for injury received, are said to be<br>men possessed of wisdom.[867] They never grieve for what is yet to come.<br>They are concerned with only what is before them and acts as they should.<br>They never indulge in sorrow for what is past or even call it to their<br>minds. Possessed of power and regulated minds, they do at their pleasure,<br>according to the way in which it should be done, what waits for them to<br>do in respect of all objects, O Devala, if solicited regardfully<br>thereto.[868] Of mature knowledge, of great wisdom, with wrath under<br>complete control, and with their passions kept under sway, they never do<br>an injury to any one in thought, word, or deed. Destitute of envy, they<br>never injure others, and possessed of self-control, they are never pained<br>at the sight of other people's prosperity. Such men never indulge in<br>exaggerated speeches, or set themselves in praising others, or in<br>speaking ill of them. They are again never affected by praise and blame<br>uttered by others in respect of them. They are tranquil in respect of all<br>their desires, and are engaged in the good of all creatures. They never<br>give way to wrath, or indulge in transports of joy, or injure any<br>creature. Untying all the knots of their hearts, they pass on very<br>happily. They have no friends nor are they the friends of others. They<br>have no foes nor are they the foes of other creatures. Indeed, men that<br>can live in this way can pass their days for ever in happiness. O best of<br>regenerate ones, they who acquire a knowledge of the rules of morality<br>and righteousness, and who observe those rules in practice, succeed in<br>winning joy, while they who fall off from the path of righteousness are<br>afflicted by anxieties and sorrow. I have now betaken myself to the path<br>of righteousness. Decried by others, why shall I get annoyed with them,<br>or praised by others, why shall I be pleased? Let men obtain whatsoever<br>objects they please from whatsoever pursuits in which they engage<br>themselves. (I am indifferent to acquisitions and losses). Praise and<br>blame are unable to contribute to my advancement or the reverse. He that<br>has understood the truths of things becomes gratified with even disregard<br>as if it were ambrosia. The man of wisdom is truly annoyed with regard as<br>if it were poison. He who is freed from all faults sleeps fearlessly both<br>here and hereafter even if insulted by others. On the other hand, he who<br>insults him, suffers destruction. Those men of wisdom who seek to attain<br>to the highest end, succeed in obtaining it by observing conduct such as<br>this. The man who has vanquished all his senses is regarded to have<br>performed all the sacrifices. Such a person attains to the highest rung,<br>viz., that of Brahma, which is eternal and which transcends the reach of<br>primordial nature. The very gods, the Gandharvas, the Pisachas, and the<br>Rakshasas, cannot reach the rung which is his who has attained to the<br>highest end.'"
