                            "Bhishma said, 'The Rakshasa king then caused a funeral pyre to be made<br>for that prince of cranes and adorned it with jewels and gems, and<br>perfumes, and costly robes. Setting fire to it with the body of that<br>prince of birds, the mighty chief of the Rakshasas caused the obsequial<br>rites of his friend to be performed according to the ordinance. At that<br>time, the auspicious goddess Surabhi, the daughter of Daksha, appeared in<br>the sky above the place where the pyre had been set up. Her breasts were<br>full of milk.[497] From her mouth, O sinless monarch, froth mixed with<br>milk fell upon the funeral pyre of Rajadharman. At this, the prince of<br>cranes became revived. Rising up, he approached his friend Virupaksha,<br>the king of the Rakshasas. At this time, the chief of the celestials<br>himself came to the city of Virupaksha. Addressing the Rakshasa king,<br>Indra said, 'By good luck, thou hast revived the prince of cranes.' The<br>chief of the deities further recited to Virupaksha the old story of the<br>curse denounced by the Grandsire upon that best of birds named<br>Rajadharman. Addressing; the king he said, 'Once on a time, O monarch,<br>this prince of cranes absented himself from the region of Brahman (when<br>his presence was expected). In wrath the Grandsire said unto this prince<br>of birds, 'Since this vile crane hath not presented himself today in my<br>assembly, therefore, that wicked-souled one shall not soon die (so as to<br>be able to leave the earth).' In consequence of these words of the<br>Grandsire, the prince of cranes, though slain by Gautama, has come back<br>to life, through the virtue of the nectar with which his body was<br>drenched.' After Indra had become silent, Rajadharman, having bowed unto<br>the chief of the celestials, said 'O first of gods, if thy heart be<br>inclined towards me for grace, then let my dear friend Gautama be<br>restored to life!' Hearing these words of his, Vasava, O foremost of men,<br>sprinkled nectar over the Brahmana Gautama and restored him to life. The<br>prince of cranes, approaching his friend Gautama, who still bore on his<br>shoulders the load of gold (that he had got from the king of the<br>Rakshasas) embraced him and felt great joy. Rajadharman, that prince of<br>cranes, dismissing Gautama of sinful deeds, together with his wealth,<br>returned to his own abode. At the due hour he repaired (the next day) to<br>the Grandsire's region. The latter honoured the high-souled bird with<br>such attentions as are shown to a guest. Gautama also, returning to his<br>home in the village of the hunters, begot many sinful children upon his<br>Sudra wife. A heavy curse was denounced upon him by the gods to the<br>effect that having begotten, within a few years,[498] upon the body of<br>his remarried wife many children that ungrateful sinner should sink into<br>a terrible hell for many years. All this, O Bharata, was recited to me<br>formerly by Narada. Recollecting the incidents of this grave story, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, I have recited to thee all its details duly.<br>Whence can an ungrateful person derive fame? Where is his place? Whence<br>can he have happiness? An ungrateful person does not deserve to be<br>trusted. One that is ungrateful can never escape. No person should injure<br>a friend. He that injures a friend sinks into terrible and everlasting<br>hell. Every one should be grateful and every one should seek to benefit<br>his friends. Everything may be obtained from a friend. Honours may be<br>obtained from friends.[499] In consequence of friends one may enjoy<br>various objects of enjoyment. Through the exertions of friends, one may<br>escape from various kinds of danger and distress. He that is wise would<br>honour his friend with his best attentions. An ungrateful, shameless, and<br>sinful wight should be shunned by those that are wise. One that injures<br>his friends is a wretch of his race. Such a sinful wight is the vilest of<br>men. I have thus told thee, O foremost of all virtuous men, what the<br>characteristics are of that sinful wretch who is stained by ingratitude<br>and who injures his friend. What else dost thou wish to hear?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words spoken by the high-souled<br>Bhishma, Yudhishthira, O Janamejaya, became highly gratified.'
