                            "Suka said, 'Let thy reverence tell me of that which is the foremost of<br>all duties, indeed, of that duty above which no higher one exists in this<br>world.'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'I shall now tell thee of duties having a very ancient<br>origin and laid down by the Rishis, duties that are distinguished above<br>all others. Listen to me with undivided attention. The senses that are<br>maddening should carefully be restrained by the understanding like a sire<br>restraining his own inexperienced children liable to fall into diverse<br>evil habits. The withdrawal of the mind and the senses from all unworthy<br>objects and their due concentration (upon worthy objects) is the highest<br>penance. That is the foremost of all duties. Indeed, that is said to be<br>the highest duty. Directing, by the aid of the understanding, the senses<br>having the mind for their sixth, and without, indeed, thinking of worldly<br>objects which have the virtue of inspiring innumerable kinds of thought,<br>one should live contented with one's own self. When the senses and the<br>mind, withdrawn from the pastures among which they usually run loose,<br>come back for residing in their proper abode, it is then that thou wilt<br>behold in thy own self the Eternal and Supreme Soul.[1064] Those<br>high-souled Brahmanas that are possessed of wisdom succeed in beholding<br>that Supreme and Universal Soul which is like unto a blazing fire in<br>effulgence. As a large tree endued with numerous branches and possessed<br>of many flowers and fruits does not know in which part it has flowers and<br>in which it has fruits, after the same manner the Soul as modified by<br>birth and other attributes, does not know whence it has come and whither<br>it is to go. There is, however, an inner Soul, which beholds (knows)<br>everything.[1065] One sees the Soul oneself with the aid of the lighted<br>lamp of knowledge. Beholding, therefore, thyself with thy own self, cease<br>to regard thy body as thyself and attain thou to omniscience. Cleansed of<br>all sins, like unto a snake that has cast off its slough, one attains to<br>high intelligence here and becomes free from every anxiety and the<br>obligation of acquiring a new body (in a subsequent birth). Its current<br>spreading in diverse directions, frightful is this river of life bearing<br>the world onward in its course. The five senses are its crocodiles. The<br>mind and its purposes are the shores. Cupidity and stupefaction of<br>judgment are the grass and straw that float on it, covering its bosom.<br>Lust and wrath are the fierce reptiles that live in it. Truth forms the<br>tirtha by its miry banks. Falsehood forms its surges, anger its mire.<br>Taking its rise from the Unmanifest, rapid is its current, and incapable<br>of being crossed by persons of uncleansed souls. Do thou, with the aid of<br>the understanding cross that river having desires for its alligators. The<br>world and its concerns constitute the ocean towards which that river<br>runs. Genus and species constitute its unfathomable depth that none can<br>understand. One's birth, O child, is the source from which that stream<br>takes its rise. Speech constitutes its eddies. Difficult to cross, only<br>men of learning and wisdom and understanding succeed in crossing it.<br>Crossing it, thou wilt succeed in freeing thyself from every attachment,<br>acquiring a tranquil heart, knowing the Soul, and becoming pure in every<br>respect. Relying them on a purged and elevated understanding, thou wilt<br>succeed in becoming Brahma's self. Having dissociated thyself from every<br>worldly attachment, having acquired a purified Soul and transcending<br>every kind of sin, look thou upon the world like a person looking from<br>the mountain top upon creatures creeping below on the earth's surface.<br>Without giving way to wrath or joy, and without forming any cruel wish,<br>thou wilt succeed in beholding the origin and the destruction of all<br>created objects. They that are endued with wisdom regard such an act to<br>be the foremost of all things. Indeed, this act of crossing the river of<br>life is regarded by the foremost of righteous persons, by ascetics<br>conversant with the truth, to be the highest of all acts that one can<br>accomplish. This knowledge of the all-pervading Soul is intended to be<br>imparted to one's son. It should be inculcated unto one that is of<br>restrained senses, that is honest in behaviour, and that is docile or<br>submissive. This knowledge of the Soul, of which I have just now spoken<br>to thee, O child, and the evidence of whose truth is furnished by the<br>Soul itself, is a mystery,&#8212;indeed, the greatest of all mysteries, and<br>the very highest knowledge that one can attain. Brahma hath no<br>sex,&#8212;male, female, or neuter. It is neither sorrow nor happiness. It<br>hath for its essence the past, the future, and the present. Whatever<br>one's sex, male or female, the person that attains to the knowledge of<br>Brahma hath never to undergo rebirth. This duty (of Yoga) hath been<br>inculcated for attaining to exemption from rebirth.[1066] These words<br>that I have used for answering thy question lead to Emancipation in the<br>same way as the diverse other opinions advanced by diverse other sages<br>that have treated of this subject. I have expounded the topic to thee<br>after the manner in which it should be expounded. Those opinions<br>sometimes become productive of fruit and sometimes not. (The words,<br>however, that I have used are of a different kind, for these are sure to<br>lead to success).[1067] For this reason, O good child, a preceptor, when<br>asked by a contented, meritorious, and self-restrained son or disciple,<br>should, with a delighted heart, inculcate, according to their true<br>import, these instructions that I have inculcated for the benefit of<br>thee, my son!'"
