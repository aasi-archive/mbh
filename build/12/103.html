                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, how a kin should behave<br>towards foe that is mild, towards one that is fierce, and towards one<br>that has many allies and a large force.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited, O Yudhishthira. the old<br>narrative of the discourse between Vrihaspati and Indra. Once on a time,<br>that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., Vasava, the chief of the celestials,<br>joining his palms, approached Vrihaspati, and saluting him, said these<br>words.'<br><br>"Indra said. 'How, O regenerate one, should I behave towards my foes? Row<br>should I subdue them by means of contrivances, without exterminating<br>them? In a collision between two armies, victory may be won by either<br>side. In what way should I behave so that this blazing prosperity that I<br>have won and that scorches all my enemies may not desert me?' Thus<br>addressed, Vrihaspati, skilled in Virtue, Profit, and Pleasure, possessed<br>of a knowledge of kingly duties, and endued with great intelligence,<br>answered Indra in the following words.'<br><br>"Vrihaspati said, 'One should never wish to subdue one's foes by quarrel.<br>Excited with wrath and bereft of forgiveness, boys only seek quarrel. One<br>that desires the destruction of a foe should not put that foe on his<br>guard. On the other hand, one should never exhibit one's ire or fear or<br>joy. He should conceal these within his own bosom. Without trusting one's<br>foe in reality, one should behave towards him as if one trusted him<br>completely. One should always speak sweet words unto one's foes and never<br>do anything that is disagreeable. One should abstain from fruitless acts<br>of hostility as also from insolence of speech. As a fowler, carefully<br>uttering cries similar to those of the birds he wishes to seize or kill.<br>captures and brings them under his power, even so should a king, O<br>Purandara, bring his foes under subjection and then slay them if he<br>likes. Having overcome one's foes, one should not sleep at ease. A foe<br>that is wicked raises his head again like afire carelessly put out making<br>its appearance again. When victory may be won by either side, a hostile<br>collision of arms should be avoided. Having lulled a foe into security,<br>one should reduce him into subjection and gain one's object. Having<br>consulted with his ministers and with intelligent persons conversant with<br>policy, a foe that is disregarded and neglected, being all along<br>unsubdued at heart, smites at the proper season, especially when the<br>enemy makes a false step. By employing trusted agents of his own, such a<br>foe would also render the other's forces inefficient by producing<br>disunion. Ascertaining the beginning, the middle and the end of his<br>foes,[309] a king should in secret cherish feelings of hostility towards<br>them. He should corrupt the forces of his foe, ascertaining everything by<br>positive proof, using the arts of producing disunion, making gifts, and<br>applying poison. A king should never live in companionship with his foes.<br>A king should wait long and then slay his foes. Indeed, he should wait,<br>expecting the opportunity, so that he might come down upon his foe at a<br>time when the latter would not expect him in the least. A king should<br>never slay a large number of the troops of his foe, although he should<br>certainly do that which would make his victory decisive. The king should<br>never do such an injury to his foe as would rankle in the latter's<br>heart.[310] Nor should he cause wounds by wordy darts and shafts. If the<br>opportunity comes, he should strike at him, without letting it slip.<br>Such, O chief of the gods, should be the conduct of a king desirous of<br>slaying his foes towards those that are his foes. If an opportunity, with<br>respect to the man who waits for it, once passes away, it can never be<br>had again by the person desirous of acting. Acting according to the<br>opinions of the wise, a king should only break the strength of his foe.<br>He should never, when the opportunity is not favourable, seek to<br>accomplish his objects. Nor should he, when the opportunity is at hand,<br>persecute his foe.[311] Giving up lust and wrath and pride, the king<br>should, acting with heedfulness, continually watch for the laches of his<br>foes. His own mildness, the severity of his punishments, his inactivity<br>and heedlessness, O chief of the gods, and the deceitful contrivances<br>well applied (by his foes), ruin a foolish ruler. That king who can<br>conquer these four faults and counteract the deceitful contrivances of<br>his enemies succeeds, without doubt, in smiting them all. When only one<br>minister (without needing any help) is competent to accomplish a secret<br>object (of the king), the king should consult with that one minister only<br>in respect of such object. Many ministers, if consulted, endeavour to<br>throw the burden of the task upon one another's shoulders and even give<br>publicity to that object which should be kept secret. If consultation<br>with one be not proper, then only should the king consult with many. When<br>foes are unseen, divine chastisement should be invoked upon them; when<br>seen, the army, consisting of four kinds of forces, should be moved.[312]<br>The king should first use the arts of producing disunion, as also those<br>of conciliation. When the time for each particular means comes, that<br>particular means should be applied. At times, the king should even<br>prostrate himself before a powerful foe. It is again desirable that<br>acting heedfully himself, he should seek to compass the victor's<br>destruction when the latter becomes heedless. By prostrating one's self,<br>by gift of tribute, by uttering sweet words, one should humble one's self<br>before a more powerful king. One should (when the occasion for such acts<br>comes) never do anything that may arouse the suspicions of one's powerful<br>foe. The weaker ruler should, under such circumstances, carefully avoid<br>every act that may awaken suspicion. A victorious king, again, should not<br>trust his vanquished foes, for they that are vanquished always remain<br>wakeful. There is nothing, O best of duties, that is more difficult of<br>accomplishment than the acquisition of prosperity, O ruler of the<br>immortals, by persons of a restless disposition. The very existence of<br>persons of restless disposition is fraught with danger. Kings should,<br>therefore, with close attention, ascertain their friends and foes. If a<br>king becomes mild, he is disregarded. If he becomes fierce, he inspires<br>people with dread. Therefore, do not be fierce. Do, not, again, be mild.<br>But be both fierce and mild. As a rapid current ceaselessly cats away the<br>high bank and causes large landslips, even so heedlessness and error<br>cause a kingdom to be ruined. Never attack many foes at the same time. By<br>applying the arts of conciliation, or gift, or production of disunion, O<br>Purandara, they should be ground one by one. As regards the remnant,<br>(being few in number,) the victor may behave peacefully towards them. An<br>intelligent king, even if competent for it, should not begin to crush all<br>(his foes) at once.[313] When a king happens to have a large army<br>consisting of sixfold forces[314] and teeming with horse, elephants,<br>cars, foot, and engines, all devoted to him, when he thinks himself<br>superior to his foe in many respects upon a fair comparison, then should<br>he openly smite the foe without hesitation. If the foe be strong, the<br>adoption of a policy of conciliation (towards him) is not worthy of<br>approbation. On the other hand, chastisement by secret means is the<br>policy that should be adopted. Nor should mildness of behaviour be<br>adopted towards such foes, nor repeated expedition, for loss of crops,<br>poisoning of wells and tanks, and suspicion in respect of the seven<br>branches of administration, should be avoided.[315] The king should, on<br>such occasions, apply diverse kinds of deception, diverse contrivances<br>for setting his foes against one another, and different kinds of<br>hypocritical behaviour. He should also, through trusted agents, ascertain<br>the doings of his foes in their cities and provinces. Kings, O slayer of<br>Vala and Vritra, pursuing their foes and entering their towers, seize and<br>appropriate the best things that are obtainable there, and devise proper<br>measures of policy in their own cities and dominions. Making gifts of<br>wealth unto them in private, and confiscating their possessions publicly,<br>without, however, injuring them materially, and proclaiming that they are<br>all wicked men that have suffered for their own misdeeds, kings should<br>send their agents to the cities and provinces of their foes. At the same<br>time, in their own cities, they should, through other persons conversant<br>with the scriptures, adorned with every accomplishment, acquainted with<br>the ordinances of the sacred books and possessed of learning cause<br>incantations and foe-killing rites to be performed.'<br><br>"Indra said, 'What are the indications, O best of regenerate ones, of a<br>wicked person? Questioned by me, tell me how I am to know who is wicked.'<br><br>"Vrihaspati said, A wicked person is he who proclaims the faults of<br>others at their back, who is inspired with envy at the accomplishments of<br>others, and who remains silent when the merits of other people are<br>proclaimed in his presence, feeling a reluctance to join in the chorus.<br>Mere silence on such occasions is no indication of wickedness. A wicked<br>person, however, at such times breathe heavily, bites his lips, and<br>shakes his head. Such a person always mixes in society and speaks<br>irrelevantly.[316] Such a man never does what he promises, when the eye<br>of the person to whom he has given the assurance is not upon him. When<br>the eye of the person assured is on him, the wicked man does not even<br>allude to the subject. The wicked man eats by himself (and not with<br>others on the same board), and finds fault with the food placed before<br>him, saying, 'All is not right today as on other days.' His disposition<br>shows itself in the circumstances connected with his sitting, lying, and<br>riding. Sorrowing on occasions of sorrow and rejoicing on occasions of<br>joy, are the indications of a friend. An opposite behaviour furnishes the<br>indications of an enemy. Keep in thy heart these sayings, O ruler of the<br>gods! The disposition of wicked men can never be concealed. I have now<br>told thee, O foremost of deities, what the indications of a wicked person<br>are. Having listened to the truths laid down in the scriptures, follow<br>them duly, O ruler of the celestials!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Having heard these words of Vrihaspati, Purandara,<br>employed in subduing his foes, acted strictly according to them. Bent<br>upon victory, that slayer of foes, when the opportunity came, obeyed<br>these instructions and reduced all his enemies to subjection.'"
