                            "Vyasa said, 'Those that are conversant with the scriptures behold, with<br>the aid of acts laid down in the scriptures, the Soul which is clothed in<br>a subtile body and is exceedingly subtile and which is dissociated from<br>the gross body in which it resides.[1087] As the rays of the Sun that<br>course in dense masses through every part of the firmament are incapable<br>of being seen by the naked eye though their existence is capable of being<br>inferred by reason, after the same manner, existent beings freed from<br>gross bodies and wandering in the universe are beyond the ken of human<br>vision.[1088] As the effulgent disc of the Sun is beheld in the water in<br>a counter-image, after the same manner the Yogin beholds within gross<br>bodies the existent self in its counter-image.[1089] All those souls<br>again that are encased in subtile forms after being freed from the gross<br>bodies in which they resided, are perceptible to Yogins who have<br>subjugated their senses and who are endued with knowledge of the soul.<br>Indeed, aided by their own souls, Yogins behold those invisible beings.<br>Whether asleep or awake, during the day as in the night, and during the<br>night as in day time, they who apply themselves to Yoga after casting off<br>all the creations of the understanding and the Rajas born of acts, as<br>also the very puissance that Yoga begets, succeed in keeping their linga<br>form under complete control.[1090] The Jiva that dwells in such Yogins,<br>always endued with the seven subtile entities (viz., Mahat,<br>consciousness, and the five tanmatras of the five elemental entities),<br>roves in all regions of bliss, freed from decrepitude and death. I say<br>'always', and 'freed from death' only in accordance with the common form<br>of speech, for in reality, that linga form is terminable.[1091] That man,<br>however, who (without having been able to transcend them) is under the<br>influence of his mind and understanding, discriminates, even in his<br>dreams, his own body from that of another and experiences (even then)<br>both pleasure and pain.[1092] Yes, in even his dreams he enjoys happiness<br>and suffers misery; and yielding to wrath and cupidity, meets with<br>calamities of various kinds. In his dreams he acquires great wealth and<br>feels highly gratified: accomplishes meritorious acts, and (sees and<br>hears, etc.) as he does in his wakeful hours. Wonderful it is to note<br>that jiva, which has to lie within the uterus and amid much internal<br>heat, and which has to pass a period of full ten months in that place, is<br>not digested and reduced to destruction like food within the stomach. Men<br>overwhelmed by the qualities of Rajas and Tamas never succeed in<br>beholding within the gross body: the Jiva-soul which is a portion of the<br>Supreme Soul of transcendent effulgence and which lies within the heart<br>of every creature. They who betake themselves to the science of Yoga for<br>the purpose of obtaining (a knowledge) of that Soul transcending the<br>inanimate and gross body, the imperceptible linga body, and the karana<br>body that is not destroyed on the occasion of even the universal<br>destruction.[1093] Amongst the duties that have been laid down for the<br>different modes of life including the fourth mode (or Sannyasa), these to<br>which I have adverted, which have yoga for their foremost, and which<br>imply a cessation of every operation of the Mind and the understanding,<br>have been laid down by Sandilya (in the Chandogya Upanishad).[1094]<br>Having comprehended the seven subtile entities (viz., the senses, the<br>objects of the mind, Mind, Understanding, Mahat, Unmanifest or Prakriti,<br>and Purusha), having comprehended also the Supreme cause of the universe<br>with the six attributes (viz., omniscience, contentment, unlimited<br>comprehension, independence, eternal wakefulness, and omnipotence), and<br>lastly having understood that the universe is only a modification of<br>Avidya endued with the three qualities, one succeeds in beholding (guided<br>by the scriptures), high Brahma.'"[1095]
