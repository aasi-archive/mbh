                            "Bhishma said, 'After that night had passed away and that best of<br>Brahmanas had left the house, Gautama, issuing from his abode, began to<br>proceed towards the sea, O Bharata! On the way he beheld some merchants<br>that used to make voyages on the sea. With that caravan of merchants he<br>proceeded towards the ocean. It so happened however, O king, that that<br>large caravan was assailed, while passing through a valley, by an<br>infuriated elephant. Almost all the persons were killed. Somehow escaping<br>from that great danger, the Brahmana fled towards the north for saving<br>his life not knowing whither he proceeded. Separated from the caravan and<br>led far away from that spot, he began to wander alone in a forest, like<br>Kimpurusha.[493] At last coming upon a road that led towards the ocean he<br>journeyed on till he reached a delightful and heavenly forest abounding<br>in flowering trees. It was adorned with mango trees that put forth<br>flowers and fruits throughout the year. It resembled the very woods of<br>Nandana (in heaven) and was inhabited by Yakshas and Kinnaras. It was<br>also adorned with Salas and palmyras and Tamalas, with clusters of black<br>aloes, and many large sandal trees. Upon the delightful tablelands that<br>he saw there, fragrant with perfumes of diverse kinds, birds of the<br>foremost species were always heard to pour forth their melodies. Other<br>winged denizens of the air, called Bharundas, and having faces resembling<br>those of human beings, and those called Bhulingas, and others belonging<br>to mountainous regions and to the sea, warbled sweetly there, Gautama<br>proceeded through that forest, listening, as he went, to those delightful<br>and charming strains of nature's choristers. On his way he beheld a very<br>delightful and level spot of land covered with golden sands and<br>resembling heaven itself, O king, for its beauty. On that plot stood a<br>large and beautiful banian with a spherical top. Possessed of many<br>branches that corresponded with the parent tree in beauty and size, that<br>banian looked like an umbrella set over the plain. The spot underneath<br>that magnificent tree was drenched with water perfumed with the most<br>fragrant sandal. Endued with great beauty and abounding in delicious<br>flowers all around, the spot looked like the court of the Grandsire<br>himself. Beholding that charming and unrivalled spot, abounding with<br>flowering trees, sacred, and looking like the abode of a very celestial,<br>Gautama became very much delighted. Arrived there, he sat himself down<br>with a well-pleased heart. As he sat there, O son of Kunti, a delicious,<br>charming, and auspicious breeze, bearing the perfume of many kinds of<br>flowers, began to blow softly, cooling the limbs of Gautama and filling<br>him with celestial pleasure, O monarch! Fanned by that perfumed breeze<br>the Brahmana became refreshed, and in consequence of the pleasure he felt<br>he soon fell asleep. Meanwhile the sun set behind the Asta hills. When<br>the resplendent luminary entered his chambers in the west and the evening<br>twilight came, a bird that was the foremost of his species, returned to<br>that spot, which was his home, from the regions of Brahman. His name was<br>Nadijangha and he was a dear friend of the creator. He was a prince of<br>Cranes, possessed of great wisdom, and a son of (the sage) Kasyapa. He<br>was also known extensively on earth by the name of Rajadharman. Indeed,<br>he surpassed everyone on earth in fame and wisdom. The child of a<br>celestial maiden, possessed of great beauty and learning, he resembled a<br>celestial in splendour. Adorned with the many ornaments that he wore and<br>that were as brilliant as the sun himself, that child of a celestial girl<br>seemed to blaze with beauty. Beholding that bird arrived at that spot,<br>Gautama became filled with wonder. Exhausted with hunger and thirst, the<br>Brahmana began to cast his eyes on the bird from desire of slaying him.'<br><br>"Rajadharman said, 'Welcome, O Brahmana! By good luck have I got thee<br>today in my abode. The sun is set. The evening twilight is come. Having<br>come to my abode, thou art today my dear and excellent guest. Having<br>received my worship according to the rites laid down in the scriptures,<br>thou mayst go whither thou wilt tomorrow morning.'"
