                            "Bharadwaja said, 'Tell me, O best of Brahmanas, how the puissant Brahman<br>residing within Meru, created these diverse kinds of objects.'<br><br>"Bhrigu said, 'The great Manasa (in his form of Brahman) created the<br>diverse kinds of objects by fiat of Will. For the protection then of all<br>creatures, he first created water. Water is the life of all creatures,<br>and it is water which aids their growth. If there be no water, all<br>creatures would perish. The whole universe is pervaded by water. Earth,<br>mountains, clouds, and all things which have form, should all be known as<br>transformations of water. They have all been produced by the<br>solidification of that element.'<br><br>Bharadwaja said, 'How did water spring? How Fire and Wind? How also was<br>the earth created? I have great doubts on these points.'<br><br>"Bhrigu said, 'O regenerate one, in very ancient times called the<br>Brahma-kalpa, the high-souled Rishis of the regenerate order, when they<br>assembled together, felt this very doubt about the creation of the<br>universe. Re-straining speech, they remained immovable, engaged in<br>(ascetic) contemplation. Having given up all food, they subsisted upon<br>air alone, and remained thus for a thousand celestial years. At the end<br>of that period, certain words as sacred as those of the Vedas<br>simultaneously reached the ears of all. Indeed, this celestial voice was<br>heard in the firmament to say, 'Formerly there was only infinite Space,<br>perfectly motionless and immovable. Without sun, moon, stars, and wind,<br>it seemed to be asleep. Then water sprang into existence like something<br>darker within darkness. Then from the pressure of water arose wind. As an<br>empty vessel without a hole appears at first to be without any sound, but<br>when filled with water, air appears and makes a great noise, even so when<br>infinite Space was filled with water, the wind arose with a great noise,<br>penetrating through the water.[553] That wind, thus generated by the<br>pressure of the ocean of water, still moveth. Coming into (unobstructed)<br>Space, its motion is never stopped. Then in consequence of the friction<br>of wind and water, fire possessed of great might and blazing energy,<br>sprang into existence, with flames directed upwards. That fire dispelled<br>the darkness that had covered Space. Assisted by the wind, fire drew<br>Space and Water together. Indeed, combining with the wind, fire became<br>solidified. While failing from the sky, the liquid portion of fire<br>solidified again and became what is known as the earth. The earth or<br>land, in which everything is born, is the origin of all kinds of taste,<br>of all kinds of scent, of all kinds of liquids, and of all kinds of<br>animals.'"
