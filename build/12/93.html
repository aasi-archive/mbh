                            "Vamadeva continued, 'When the king, who is powerful, acts unrighteously<br>towards the weak, they who take their birth in his race imitate the same<br>conduct. Others, again, imitate that wretch who sets sin agoing. Such<br>imitation of the man ungoverned by restraints soon brings destruction<br>upon the kingdom. The conduct of a king who is observant of his proper<br>duties, is accepted by men in general as a model for imitation. The<br>conduct, however, of a king who falls away from his duties, is not<br>tolerated by his very kinsfolk. That rash king who, disregarding the<br>injunctions laid down in the scriptures, acts with highhandedness in his<br>kingdom, very soon meets with destruction. That Kshatriya who does not<br>follow the conduct observed from days of old by other Kshatriyas.<br>conquered or unconquered, is said to fall away from Kshatriya duties.<br>Having seized in battle a royal foe that did some good to the conqueror<br>on a former occasion, that king who does not, actuated by malice, pay him<br>honours, is said to fall away from Kshatriya duties. The king should<br>display his power, live cheerfully, and do what is necessary in seasons<br>of danger. Such a ruler becomes the beloved of all creatures and never<br>falls away from prosperity. If thou doest disservice to any person, thou<br>shouldst, when the turn comes, do him service. One who is not loved<br>becomes an object of love, if he does what is agreeable. Untruthful<br>speeches should be avoided. Thou shouldst do good to others without being<br>solicited. Thou shouldst never abandon righteousness from lust or wrath<br>or malice. Do not give harsh answers when questioned by anybody. Do not<br>utter undignified speeches. Never be in a hurry to do anything. Never<br>indulge in malice. By such means is a foe won over. Do not give way to<br>exclusive joy when anything agreeable occurs, nor suffer thyself to be<br>overwhelmed with sorrow when anything disagreeable occurs. Never indulge<br>in grief when thy pecuniary resources are exhausted, and always remember<br>the duty of doing good to thy subjects. That king who always does what is<br>agreeable by virtue of his disposition achieves success in all his<br>measures and is never shorn of prosperity. The king should always, with<br>heedfulness, cherish that devoted servant who abstains from doing what is<br>injurious to his master and who always does what is for his good. He<br>should appoint in all great affairs persons that have subjugated their<br>senses, that are devotedly loyal and of pure behaviour, and that are<br>possessed of ability. That person, who by the possession of such<br>qualifications pleases the king and who is never heedless in taking care<br>of the interests of his master should be appointed by the king in the<br>affairs of his kingdom. On the other hand, the king becomes divested of<br>prosperity by appointing to important offices men that are fools and<br>slaves of their senses, that are covetous and of disrespectable conduct,<br>that are deceitful and hypocritical, that are malicious, wicked-souled,<br>and ignorant, that are low-minded, and addicted to drink, gambling,<br>women, and hunting. That king, who, first protecting his own self,<br>protects others that deserve protection, feels the satisfaction of<br>finding his subjects growing in prosperity. Such a king succeeds also in<br>obtaining greatness. A king should, by secret agents that are devoted to<br>him, watch the conduct and acts of other kings. By such means can he<br>obtain superiority. Having injured a powerful king, one should not<br>comfort himself with the thought that he (the injurer) lives at a great<br>distance from the injured. Such a king when injured falls upon the<br>injurer like the hawk swooping down upon its prey, in moments of<br>heedlessness. A king whose power has been consolidated and who is<br>confident of his own strength, should assail a neighbour who is weaker<br>than himself but never one that is stronger. A king who is devoted to<br>virtue, having acquired the sovereignty of the earth by prowess, should<br>protect his subjects righteously and slaughter foes in battle. Everything<br>belonging to this world is destined to destruction. Nothing here is<br>durable. For this reason, the king, adhering to righteousness, should<br>protect his subjects righteously. The defence of forts, battle,<br>administration of justice, consultations on questions of policy, and<br>keeping the subjects in happiness, these five acts contribute to enlarge<br>the dominions of a king. That king who takes proper care of these is<br>regarded to be the best of kings. By always attending to these, a king<br>succeeds in protecting his kingdom. It is impossible, however, for one<br>man to supervise all these matters at all times. Making over such<br>supervision to his ministers, a King may govern the earth for ever.[277]<br>The people make such a person their king who is liberal, who shares all<br>objects of enjoyment with others, who is possessed of a mild disposition,<br>who is of pure behaviour, and who will never abandon his subjects. He is<br>obeyed in the world who, having listened to counsels of wisdom, accepts<br>them, abandoning his own opinions. That king who does not tolerate the<br>counsels of a well-wisher in consequence of their opposition to his own<br>views, who listens with inattention to what is said unto him in<br>opposition to his views, and who does not always follow the conduct of<br>high and noble persons conquered or unconquered, is said to fall away<br>from the duties of Kshatriyas. From ministers that have once been<br>chastised, from women in especial, from mountains and inaccessible<br>regions, from elephants and horses and reptiles, the king should always,<br>with heedfulness, protect his own self.[278] That king who, abandoning<br>his chief ministers, makes favourites of low persons, soon falls into<br>distress, and never succeeds in compassing the (intended) ends of his<br>measures. That king of infirm soul, who, yielding to the influence of<br>wrath and malice, does not love and honour those amongst his kinsmen that<br>are possessed of good qualities, is said to live on the very verge of<br>destruction. That king, who attaches to himself accomplished persons by<br>doing good to them even though he may not like them at heart, succeeds in<br>enjoying fame for ever. Thou shouldst never impose taxes unseasonably.<br>Thou shouldst not be grieved at the occurrence of anything disagreeable,<br>nor rejoice exceedingly at anything agreeable. Thou shouldst always set<br>thyself to the accomplishment of good acts. Who amongst the dependent<br>kings is truly devoted to thee, and who is loyal to thee from fear, and<br>who amongst them has faults, should always be ascertained by thee. The<br>king, even if he be powerful, should trust them that are weak, for in<br>moments of heedlessness the weak may assail the powerful like a flock of<br>vultures seizing their prey. A man of sinful soul seeks to injure his<br>master even if the latter be sweet-speeched and possessed of every<br>accomplishment. Do not, therefore, place thy confidence upon such men.<br>Nahusha's son Yayati, in declaring the mysteries of king-craft, said that<br>a person engaged in ruling men should slay even foes that are<br>contemptible.'"
