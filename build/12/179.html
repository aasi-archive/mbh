                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O thou that art conversant with the conduct of men,<br>tell me by what conduct a person may succeed in this world, freed from<br>grief. How also should a person act in this world so that he may attain<br>to an excellent end?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old story of the<br>discourse between Prahlada and the sage Ajagara. Once on a time king<br>Prahlada of great intelligence questioned a wandering Brahmana of great<br>intelligence and a cleansed and tranquil soul.'<br><br>"Prahlada said, 'Freed from desire, with a cleansed soul, possessed of<br>humility and self-restraint, without desire of action, free from malice,<br>agreeable in speech, endued with dignity and intelligence and wisdom,<br>thou livest (in simplicity) like a child. Thou never covetest any kind of<br>gain, and never grievest at any kind of loss. Thou art always contented,<br>O Brahmana, and dost not seem to regard anything in the world. While all<br>other creatures are being borne away in the current of desire and<br>passion, thou art perfectly indifferent to all acts appertaining to<br>Religion, Profit, and Pleasure. Thou seemest to be in a state of quietude<br>(without the possibility of agitation). Disregarding all objects of the<br>senses, thou movest like an emancipated self, only witnessing everything<br>(but never taking part in anything). What, O sage, is thy wisdom, what<br>thy learning, and what thy behaviour (in consequence of which all this<br>becomes possible)? Tell me this without delay, if, O Brahmana, thou<br>thinkest it will do me good!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'That intelligent Brahmana who was well-conversant<br>with the duties of the world, thus questioned by Prahlada, answered him<br>in sweet words of grave import. Behold, O Prahlada, the origin of<br>creatures, their growth, decay, and death, are traceable to no<br>(intelligible) cause. It is for this that I do not indulge in either joy<br>or sorrow.[536] All the propensities (for action) that exist in the<br>universe may be seen to flow from the very natures of the creatures (to<br>which they inhere). All things (in the universe) are depended on their<br>respective natures. Hence, I am not delighted with anything.[537] Behold,<br>O Prahlada, all kinds of union have an aptitude for disunion. All<br>acquisitions are certain to end in destruction. Hence I never set my<br>heart upon the acquisition of any object. All things possessed of<br>attributes are certain to meet with destruction. What remains there for a<br>person then to do who (like me) is conversant with both the origin and<br>the end of things? Of all things, large or small, born in the ocean of<br>waters, the end is noticeable. I see also the death, which is manifest, O<br>chief of Asuras, of all things, mobile and immobile, belonging to the<br>land. O best of Danavas, death comes in season unto even the strongest of<br>winged creatures which range the sky. I see again that the luminous<br>bodies, large and small, which move in the firmament, fall down when<br>their time comes. Beholding all created things Possessed of knowledge, to<br>be thus liable to be affected by death, and thinking all things to be<br>possessed of the same nature, I sleep in peace without any anxiety of<br>heart. If I get without trouble a copious repast, I do not scruple to<br>enjoy it. On the other hand, I pass many days, together without eating<br>anything. Sometimes people feed me with costly viands in profusion,<br>sometimes with a small quantity, sometimes with even less, and sometimes<br>I get no food whatever. I sometimes eat only a portion of a grain;<br>sometimes the dry sesame cakes from which the oil has been pressed out, I<br>sometimes eat rice and other food of the richest kind. Sometimes I sleep<br>on an elevated bedstead of the best kind. Sometimes I sleep on the bare<br>ground. Sometimes my bed is made within a fine palace or mansion. I am<br>sometimes clad in rags, sometimes in sackcloth, sometimes in raiments of<br>fine texture, sometimes in deer-skins, sometimes in robes of the<br>costliest kind. I never reject such enjoyments as are consistent with<br>virtue and as are obtained by me without effort. I do not, at the same<br>time, strive for attaining such objects as are difficult of acquisition.<br>The rigid vow I have adopted is called Ajagara.[538] That vow can secure<br>immortality. It is auspicious and griefless. It is incomparable and pure.<br>It is consistent with the counsels of the wise. It is disapproved by<br>persons of foolish understanding who never follow it. With a pure heart I<br>conduct myself according to it. My mind never swerves from this vow. I<br>have not swerved from the practices of my order. I am abstemious in<br>everything. I know the past and the present. Divested of fear and wrath<br>and cupidity and errors of judgment, I follow this vow with a pure heart.<br>There are no restrictions in respect of food and drink and other objects<br>of enjoyment for one practising this vow. As everything is dependent on<br>destiny, there is no observance of the considerations of time and place<br>for one like us. The vow I follow contributes to true happiness of the<br>heart. It is never observed by those that are wicked. I follow it with a<br>pure heart. Induced by cupidity, men pursue different kinds of wealth. If<br>baffled in the pursuit, they become depressed by sorrow. Reflecting<br>properly upon all this by the aid of my intelligence which has penetrated<br>the truths of things, I follow this vow with a pure heart. I have seen<br>persons in distress seeking, for the acquisition of wealth, the shelter<br>of men, good and bad. Devoted to tranquillity, and with my passions under<br>control, I follow this vow with a pure heart. Beholding, by the aid of<br>truth, that happiness and misery, loss and gain, attachment and<br>renunciation, death and life, are all ordained by destiny, I follow this<br>vow with a pure heart. Divested of fear and attachment and errors of<br>judgment and pride, and endued with wisdom, intelligence, and<br>understanding, and devoted to tranquillity and hearing that large snakes<br>without moving enjoy the fruit that comes to them of itself, I follow<br>their practice with a pure heart. Without restrictions of any kind in<br>respect of bed and food, endued by my nature with self-restraint,<br>abstemiousness, pure vow, truth, and purity of conduct, and without any<br>desire to store (for future use) the rewards of action, I follow, with a<br>delighted and pure heart, this vow. All causes of sorrow have fled from<br>me in consequence of my having driven off the object of desire. Having<br>received an accession of light, I follow this vow with a pure heart, for<br>controlling my soul which is thirsty and unrestrained but which is<br>capable (under proper culture) of depending upon itself (without the<br>necessity of external objects to keep it engaged). Without paying any<br>heed to the concerns towards which my heart, mind, words would like to<br>lead me, and marking that the happiness which is connected with these is<br>both difficult of acquisition and fleeting in respect of duration, I<br>follow this vow with a pure heart. Learned men possessed of great<br>intelligence, desirous of proclaiming their own feats, have while<br>establishing their own theories and censuring those of others, said this<br>and that on this topic which is incapable of being settled by<br>disputation. Foolish men fail to understand this vow in a proper light.<br>I, however, see it to be destructive of Ignorance. Regarding it also as<br>fraught with immortality and as a remedy against diverse kinds of evil, I<br>wander among men, having subdued all faults and having freed myself from<br>thirst (after worldly goods)!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'That high-souled person who, having freed himself<br>from attachments and divested himself of fear, cupidity; foolishness, and<br>wrath, follows this Ajagara vow, or indulges in this sport, as it may be<br>called, certainly succeeds in passing his days in great delight.'"
