                            "Bhishma said, 'O mighty-armed one, listen now to me, O thou of prowess<br>incapable of being baffled, as I mention the names of the four modes of<br>life and the duties in respect of each. The four modes are Vanaprastha,<br>Bhaikshya, Garhasthya of great merit, and Brahmacharya which is adopted<br>by Brahmanas. Undergoing the purificatory rite in respect of bearing<br>matted locks, after having gone through the rite of regeneration and<br>performed for some time the rites in respect of the sacred fire and<br>studied the Vedas, one should, with cleansed soul and senses under<br>restraint, having first carefully performed all the duties of the mode<br>called Garhasthya, proceed, with or without his wife, to the woods for<br>adoption of the mode called Vanaprastha. Having studied the scriptures<br>called Aranyakas, having drawn up his vital fluid and having retired from<br>all worldly affairs, the virtuous recluse may then attain to an<br>absorption with the eternal Soul knowing no decay. These are the<br>indications of Munis that have drawn up their vital fluid. A learned<br>Brahmana, O king, should first practise and perform them. The Brahmana, O<br>king, that is desirous of emancipation, it is well known, is competent to<br>adopt the Bhaikshya mode after having gone through the mode called<br>Brahmacharya. Sleeping at that place (in the course of the wanderings)<br>where evening overtakes him, without desire of bettering his situation,<br>without a home, subsisting on whatever food is obtained (in charity),<br>given to contemplation, practising self-restraint, with the senses under<br>control, without desire, regarding all creatures equally, without<br>enjoyments, without dislike to anything, the Brahmana possessed of<br>learning, by adopting this mode of life, attains to absorption with the<br>eternal Soul that knows no decay. The person leading the Garhasthya mode<br>of life should, after studying the Vedas, accomplish all the religious<br>acts laid down for him. He should beget children and enjoy pleasures and<br>comforts. With careful attention he should accomplish all the duties of<br>this mode of life that is applauded by ascetics and that is extremely<br>difficult to go through (without transgressions). He should be satisfied<br>with his own wedded wife and should never approach her except her season.<br>He should observe the ordinances of the scriptures, should not be cunning<br>and deceitful. He should be abstemious in diet, devoted to the gods,<br>grateful, mild, destitute of cruelty, and forgiving. He should be of a<br>tranquil heart, tractable and attentive in making offerings to the gods<br>and the Pitris. He should always be hospitable to the Brahmanas. He<br>should be without pride, and his charity should not be confined to any<br>one sect. He should also be always devoted to the performance of the<br>Vedic rites. In this connection, the illustrious and great Rishis cite a<br>verse sung by Narayana himself, of grave import and endued with high<br>ascetic merit. Listen to me as I repeat it.&#8212;'By truth, simplicity,<br>worship of guests, acquisition of morality and profit, and enjoyment of<br>one's own wedded wives, one should enjoy diverse kinds of happiness both<br>here and hereafter.' The great Rishis have said that support of sons and<br>wives, and study of the Vedas, form the duties of those that lead this<br>high mode of life. That Brahmana who, always engaged in the performance<br>of sacrifices, duly goes through this mode of life and properly<br>discharges all its duties, obtains blessed rewards in heaven. Upon his<br>death, the rewards desired by him became deathless. Indeed, these wait<br>upon him for eternity like menials ever on the alert to execute the<br>commands of their master.[194] Always attending to the Vedas, silently<br>reciting the mantras obtained from his preceptor, worshipping all the<br>deities, O Yudhishthira, dutifully waiting upon and serving his preceptor<br>with his own body smeared with clay and filth, the person leading the<br>Brahmacharya mode of life should always observe rigid vows and, with<br>senses under control, should always pay attention to the instructions he<br>has received. Reflecting on the Vedas and discharging all the duties (in<br>respect of contemplation and overt acts), he should live, dutifully<br>waiting upon his preceptor and always bowing unto him. Unengaged in the<br>six kinds of work (such as officiating in the sacrifices of others), and<br>never engaged with attachment to any kind of acts, never showing favour<br>or disfavour to any one, doing good even unto his enemies, these, O sire,<br>are the duties laid down for a Brahmacharin!'
