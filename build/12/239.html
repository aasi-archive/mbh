                            "Bhishma said, 'Thus addressed (by his sire), Suka, highly applauding<br>these instructions of the great Rishi, set himself about asking the<br>following, question relating to the import of duties that lead to<br>Emancipation.'<br><br>"Suka said, 'By what means doth one possessed of wisdom, conversant with<br>the Vedas, observant of sacrifices, endued with wisdom, and free from<br>malice, succeed in attaining to Brahma which is incapable of being<br>apprehended by either direct evidence or inference, and unsusceptible of<br>being indicated by the Vedas? Asked by me, tell me by what means is<br>Brahma to be apprehended? Is it by penance, by Brahmacharya, by<br>renunciation of everything, by intelligence, by the aid of the Sankhya<br>philosophy, or by Yoga? By what means may what kind of singleness of<br>purpose be attained by men, with respect to both, viz., the mind and the<br>senses? It behoveth thee to expound all this to me.'[949]<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'No man ever attains to success by means other than the<br>acquisition of knowledge, the practice of penances, the subjugation of<br>the senses, and renunciation of everything.[950] The great entities (five<br>in number) represent the first (or initial) creation of the Self-born.<br>They have been very largely placed in embodied creatures included in the<br>world of life.[951] The bodies of all embodied creatures are derived from<br>earth. The humours are from water. Their eyes are said to be derived from<br>light. Prana, Apana (and the three other vital breaths) have the wind for<br>their refuge. And, lastly, all unoccupied apertures within them (such as<br>the nostrils, the cavities of the ear, etc.) are of Space. In the feet<br>(of living creatures) is Vishnu. In their arms is Indra. Within the<br>stomach is Agni desirous of eating. In the ears are the points of the<br>horizon (or the compass) representing the sense of hearing. In the tongue<br>is speech which is Saraswati.[952] The ears, skin, eyes, tongue and nose<br>forming the fifth, are said to be the sense of knowledge. These exist for<br>the purposes of apprehension of their respective objects. Sound, touch,<br>form, taste and scent forming the fifth, are the objects of the (five)<br>senses. These should always be regarded as separate from (or independent<br>of) the senses. Like the charioteer setting his well-broken steeds along<br>the paths he pleases, the mind sets the senses (along directions it<br>pleases). The mind, in its turn, is employed by the knowledge sitting in<br>the heart.[953] The mind is the lord of all these senses in respect of<br>employing them in their functions and guiding or restraining them.<br>Similarly, the knowledge is the lord of the mind (in employing, and<br>guiding or restraining it).[954] The senses, the objects of the senses,<br>the attributes of those objects represented by the word nature,<br>knowledge, mind, the vital breaths, and Jiva dwell in the bodies of all<br>embodied creatures.[955] The body within which the knowledge dwells has<br>no real existence. The body, therefore, is not the refuge of the<br>knowledge. Primordial Nature (Prakriti) having the three attributes (of<br>Goodness and Passion and Darkness) is the refuge of the knowledge which<br>exists only in the form of a sound. The Soul also is not the refuge of<br>the knowledge. It is Desire that creates the knowledge. Desire, however,<br>never creates the three attributes.[956] The man of wisdom, capable of<br>subduing his senses, beholds the seventeenth, viz., the Soul, as<br>surrounded by six and ten attributes, in his own knowledge by the aid of<br>the mind. The Soul cannot be beheld with the aid of the eye or with that<br>of all the senses. Transcending all, the Soul becomes visible by only the<br>light of the mind's lamp. Divested of the properties of sound and touch<br>and form, without taste and scent, indestructible and without a body<br>(either gross or subtile) and without senses, it is nevertheless beheld<br>within the body. Unmanifest and supreme, it dwells in all mortal bodies.<br>Following the lead of the preceptor and the Vedas, he who beholds it<br>hereafter becomes Brahma's self. They that are possessed of wisdom look<br>with an equal eye upon a Brahmana possessed of knowledge and disciples, a<br>cow, an elephant, a dog, and a Chandala.[957] Transcending all things,<br>the Soul dwells in all creatures mobile and immobile. Indeed, all things<br>are pervaded by it.[958] When a living creature beholds his own Soul in<br>all things, and all things in his own Soul, he is said to attain to<br>Brahma. One occupies that much of the Supreme Soul as is commensurate<br>with what is occupied in one's own soul by Vedic sound.[959]He that can<br>always realise the identity of all things with his own self certainly<br>attains to immortality. The very gods are stupefied in the track of that<br>trackless man who constitutes himself the soul of all creatures, who is<br>engaged in the good of all beings, and who desire to attain to (Brahma<br>which is) the final refuge (of all things).[960] Indeed, the track which<br>is pursued by men of knowledge is as visible as that of birds in the sky<br>or of fish in water. Time of its own power, cooks all entities within<br>itself. No one, however, knows That in which Time, in its turn, is itself<br>cooked.[961] That (of which I speak) does not occur above, or in the<br>middle or below, or in transverse or in any other direction. That is to<br>tangible entity; it is not to be found in any place.[962] All these<br>worlds are within That. There is nothing in these worlds that exists out<br>of that. Even if one goes on ceaselessly with the celerity of a shaft<br>impelled from the bow-string, even if one goes on with the speed of the<br>mind, itself, one would not still reach the end of that which is the<br>cause of all this.[963] That is so gross that there is nothing grosser.<br>His hands and feet extend everywhere. His eyes, head, and face are<br>everywhere. His ears are everywhere in the universe. He exists<br>overwhelming all things. That is minuter than the minutest, that is the<br>heart of all entities. Existing, without doubt, that is still<br>imperceptible. Indestructible and destructible,&#8212;these are the dual forms<br>of existence of the (Supreme) Soul. In all mobile and immobile entities<br>the existence it displays is destructible; while the existence it<br>displays in Chaitanya is celestial, immortal, and indestructible. Though<br>the lord of a existent beings both mobile and immobile, though inactive<br>and divested of attributes, it enters, nevertheless, the well-known<br>mansion of nine doors and becomes engaged in action.[964] Men of wisdom<br>who are capable of beholding the other shore say that the Unborn (or the<br>Supreme Soul) becomes invested with the attribute of action in<br>consequence of motion, pleasure and pain, variety of form, and the nine<br>well-known possessions.[965] That indestructible Soul which is said to be<br>invested with the attribute of action is nothing else than that<br>indestructible Soul which is said to be inactive. A person of knowledge,<br>by attaining to that indestructible essence, gives up for good both life<br>and birth.'"[966]
