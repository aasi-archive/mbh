                            "The king said, 'I am a king called by the name of Viradyumna. My fame<br>has spread in all directions. My son Bhuridyumna hath been lost. It is in<br>quest of him that I have come to this forest. Ye foremost of Brahmanas,<br>that child was my only son and, ye sinless ones, he is of very tender<br>years. He cannot, however, be found here. I am wandering everywhere for<br>finding him out.'<br><br>"Rishabha continued, 'After the king had said these words, the ascetic<br>Tanu hung down his head. He remained perfectly silent, without uttering a<br>single word in answer. In former days that Brahmana had not been much<br>honoured by the king. In disappointment, O monarch, he had for that<br>reason practised austere penances for a longtime, resolving in his mind<br>that he should never accept anything in gift from either kings or members<br>of any other order. And he said to himself, 'Hope agitates every man of<br>foolish understanding. I shall drive away hope from my mind.' Even such<br>had been his determination. Viradyumna once more questioned that foremost<br>of ascetics in these words:<br><br>"The king said, 'What is the measure of the thinness of Hope? What on<br>earth is exceedingly difficult of acquisition? Tell me this, O holy one,<br>for thou art well conversant with morality and profit."<br><br>"Rishabha continued, 'Himself recollecting all the past incidents (about<br>his own disregard at the hands of the king) and calling them back to the<br>recollection of the king also, that holy Brahmana of emaciated body<br>addressed the king and said the following words:<br><br>"The sage said, 'There is nothing, O king, that equals Hope in<br>slenderness. I had solicited many kings and found that nothing is so<br>difficult of acquisition as an image that Hope sets before the mind.'<br><br>"The king said, 'At thy words, O Brahmana, I understand what is slender<br>and what is not so.[383] I understand also how difficult of acquisition<br>are the images set by Hope before the mind. I regard these words of thine<br>as utterances of Sruti. O thou of great wisdom, one doubt, however, has<br>arisen in my-mind. It behoveth thee, O sage, to explain it in detail unto<br>me that ask thee. What is more slender than thy body? Tell me this, O<br>holy one, if, of course, O best of sages, the topic be one which may be<br>discoursed upon without impropriety.'<br><br>"The emaciated sage said, 'A contented applicant is exceedingly difficult<br>to meet with. Perhaps, there is none such in the world. Something rarer<br>still, O sire, is the person that never disregards an applicant. The hope<br>that rests upon such persons as do not, after passing their promises, do<br>good to others according to the best of their powers and according as the<br>applicants deserve, is slenderer than even my body.[384] The hope that<br>rests upon an ungrateful man, or upon one that is cruel, or one that is<br>idle, or one that injures others, is slenderer than even my body.[384]<br>The hope cherished by a sire that has but one son, of once more seeing<br>that son after he has been lost or missed, is slenderer than even my<br>body. The hope that old women entertain of bringing forth sons, O king,<br>and that is cherished by rich men, is slenderer than even my body. The<br>hope that springs up in the hearts of grown up maidens of marriage when<br>they hear anybody only talk of it in their presence, is slenderer than<br>even my body.'[385] Hearing these words, O monarch, king Viradyumna, and<br>the ladies of his household, prostrated themselves before that bull among<br>Brahmanas and touched his feet with their bent heads.'<br><br>"The king said, 'I beg thy grace, O holy one! I wish to meet with my<br>child. What thou hast said, O best of Brahmanas, is very true. There is<br>no doubt of the truth of thy utterances.'<br><br>"Rishabha continued, 'The holy Tanu, that foremost of virtuous persons,<br>smiling, caused, by means of his learning and his penances the king's son<br>to be brought to that spot. Having caused the prince to be brought<br>thither, the sage rebuked the king (his father).[386] That foremost of<br>virtuous persons then displayed himself to be the god of righteousness.<br>Indeed, having displayed his own wonderful and celestial form, he entered<br>an adjacent forest, with heart freed from wrath and the desire of<br>revenge. I saw all this, O king, and heard the words I have said. Drive<br>off thy hope, that is even slenderer (than any of those which the sage<br>indicated).'<br><br>"Bhishma continued 'Thus addressed, O monarch, by the high-souled<br>Rishabha, king Sumitra speedily cast off the hope that was in his heart<br>and which was slenderer (than any of the kinds of hope indicated by the<br>emaciated Rishi). Do thou also, O son of Kunti, hearing these words of<br>mine, be calm and collected like Himavat. Overcome with distress,[387]<br>thou hast questioned me and heard my answer. Having heard it. O monarch,<br>it behoves thee to dispel these regrets of thine!'
