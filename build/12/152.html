                            "Saunaka said, 'I shall for these reasons discourse to thee of<br>righteousness, to thee whose heart has been exceedingly agitated.<br>Possessed of knowledge and great strength, and with a contented heart,<br>thou seekest righteousness of thy own will. A king, first becoming<br>exceedingly stern, then shows compassion and does good to all creatures<br>by his acts. This is certainly very wonderful. People say that that king<br>who commences with sternness burns the whole world. Thou wert stern<br>before. But thou turnest thy eyes on righteousness now. Forsaking<br>luxurious food and all articles of enjoyment, thou hast betaken thyself<br>for a long time to rigid penances. All this, O Janamejaya, is certain to<br>appear wonderful to those kings that are sunk in sin. That he who has<br>affluence should become liberal, or that he who is endued with wealth of<br>asceticism should become reluctant to spend it, is not at all wonderful.<br>It has been said that the one does not live at a distance from the<br>other.[443] That which is ill-judged produces misery in abundance. That<br>on the other hand, which is accomplished with the aid of sound judgment<br>leads to excellent results.[444] Sacrifice, gift, compassions, the Vedas,<br>and truth, O lord of the earth&#8212;these five&#8212;are cleansing. The sixth is<br>penance well-performed. This last, O Janamejaya, is highly cleansing for<br>kings. By betaking thyself to it properly, thou art certain to earn great<br>merit and blessedness. Visiting sacred spots has also been said to be<br>highly cleansing. In this connection are cited the following verses sung<br>by Yayati: 'That mortal who would earn life and longevity should, after<br>having performed sacrifices with devotion, renounce them (in old age) and<br>practise penances.' The field of Kuru has been said to be sacred. The<br>river Saraswati has been said to be more so. The tirthas of the Saraswati<br>are more sacred than the Saraswati herself; and the tirtha called<br>Prithudaka is more sacred than all the tirthas of the Saraswati. One that<br>has bathed in Prithudaka. and drunk its waters will not have to grieve<br>for a premature death. Thou shouldst go to Mahasaras, to all the tirthas<br>designated by the name of Pushkara, to Prabhasa, to the northern lake<br>Manasa, and to Kalodaka. Thou shalt then regain life and acquire<br>longevity. Lake Manasa is on the spot where the Saraswati and the<br>Drisadwati mingle with each other. A person possessed of Vedic knowledge<br>should bathe in these places. Manu has said that liberality is the best<br>of all duties and that renunciation is better than liberality. In this<br>connection is cited the following verse composed by Satyavat. (One should<br>act) as a child full of simplicity and destitute of either merit or sin.<br>As regards all creatures there is in this would neither misery nor<br>happiness. (That which is called misery and that which is called<br>happiness are the results of a distraught imagination.) Even this is the<br>true nature of all living creatures. Of all creatures, their lives are<br>superior who have betaken themselves to renunciation and abstained from<br>acts both meritorious and sinful. I shall now tell thee those acts which<br>are best for a king. By putting forth thy might and liberality do thou<br>conquer heaven, O king! That man who possesses the attributes of might<br>and energy succeeds in attaining to righteousness.[445] Do thou rule the<br>earth, O king, for the sake of the Brahmanas and for the sake of<br>happiness. Thou usedst formerly to condemn the Brahmanas. Do thou gratify<br>them now. Though they have cried fie on thee and though they have<br>deserted thee, do thou still, guided by knowledge of self, solemnly<br>pledge thyself never to injure them. Engaged in acts proper for thee,<br>seek what is for thy highest good. Amongst rulers some one becomes as<br>cool as snow; some one, as fierce as fire; some one becomes like a plough<br>(uprooting all enemies); and some one, again, becomes like a thunder-bolt<br>(suddenly scorching his foes). He who wishes to prevent self-destruction<br>should never mix with wicked wights for general or special reasons. From<br>a sinful act committed only once, one may cleanse one's self by repenting<br>of it. From a sinful act committed twice, one may cleanse one's self by<br>vowing never to commit it again. From such an act committed thrice, one<br>may cleanse one's self by the resolution to bear one's self righteously<br>ever afterwards. By committing such an act repeatedly, one may cleanse<br>one's self by a trip to sacred places. One who is desirous of obtaining<br>prosperity should do all that results in blessedness. They who live<br>amidst fragrant odours themselves become fragrant in consequence. They,<br>on the other hand, who live in the midst of foul stench themselves become<br>foul. One devoted to the practice of ascetic penances is soon cleansed of<br>all one's sins. By worshipping the (homa) fire for a year, one stained by<br>diverse sins becomes purified. One guilty of foeticide is cleansed by<br>worshipping the fire for three years. One guilty of foeticide becomes<br>cleansed at even a hundred Yojanas from Mahasaras, or the tirthas called<br>Pushkara, or Prabhasa, or Manasa on the north, if only one gets out for<br>any of them.[446] A slayer of creatures is cleansed of his sins by saying<br>from imminent peril as many creatures of that particular species as have<br>been slain by him. Manu has said that by diving in water after thrice<br>reciting the Aghamarshana mantras, one reaps the fruits of the final bath<br>in a Horse-sacrifice.[447] Such an act very soon cleanses one of all<br>one's sins, and one regains in consequence the esteem of the world. All<br>creatures become obedient to such a person like helpless idiots (obedient<br>to those that surround them). The gods and Asuras, in days of yore,<br>approaching the celestial preceptor Vrihaspati, O king, humbly enquired<br>of him, saying, 'Thou knowest, O great Rishi, the fruits of virtue, as<br>also the fruits of those other acts that lead to hell in the next world.<br>Does not that person succeed in liberating himself from both merit and<br>sin with whom the two (weal and woe) are equal? Tell us, O great Rishi,<br>what the fruits of righteousness are, and how does a righteous person<br>dispels his sins.'<br><br>"Vrihaspati answered, 'If having committed sin through folly, one does<br>meritorious acts understanding their nature, one succeeds, by such<br>righteousness, in cleansing one's self from sin even as a piece of dirty<br>cloth is washed clean by means of some saline substance. One should not<br>boast after having committed sin. By having recourse to faith and by<br>freeing one's self from malice, one succeeds in obtaining blessedness.<br>That person who covers the faults, even when exposed, of good men,<br>obtains blessedness even after committing faults. As the sun rising at<br>morn dispels darkness, one dispels all ones sins by acting righteously.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Indrota, the son of Sunaka, having said these words<br>unto king Janamejaya, assisted him, by his ministrations, in the<br>performance of the horse-sacrifice. The king, cleansed of his sins and<br>regaining blessedness, shone with splendour like a blazing fire, and that<br>slayer of foes then entered his kingdom like Soma in his full form<br>entering heaven.'"
