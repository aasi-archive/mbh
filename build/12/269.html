                            "Kapila said, 'Beholding that all the fruits that are attainable by acts<br>are terminable instead of being eternal, Yatis, by adopting<br>self-restraint and tranquillity, attain to Brahma through the path of<br>knowledge. There is nothing in any of the worlds that can impede them<br>(for by mere fiats of their will they crown all their wishes with<br>success). They are freed from the influence of all pairs of opposites.<br>They never bow down their heads to anything or any creature. They are<br>above all the bonds of want. Wisdom is theirs. Cleansed they are from<br>every sin. Pure and spotless they live and rove about (in great<br>happiness). They have, in their own understandings, arrived at settled<br>conclusions in respect of all destructible objects and of a life of<br>Renunciation (by comparing the two together). Devoted to Brahma, already<br>become like unto Brahma, they have taken refuge in Brahma. Transcending<br>grief, and freed from (the equality of) Rajas, theirs are acquisitions<br>that are eternal. When the high end that is these men's is within reach<br>of attainment, what need has one for practising the duties of the<br>domestic mode of life?'[1240]<br><br>"Syumarasmi said, 'If, indeed, that be the highest object of acquisition,<br>if that be truly the highest end (which is attained by practising<br>Renunciation) then the importance of the domestic mode of life becomes<br>manifest, because without the domestic mode no other mode of life ever<br>becomes possible. Indeed, as all living creatures are able to live in<br>consequence of their dependence on their respective mothers, after the<br>same manner the three other modes of life exist in consequence of their<br>dependence upon the domestic mode. The householder who leads the life of<br>domesticity, performs sacrifices, and practises penances. Whatever is<br>done by anybody from desire of happiness has for its root the domestic<br>mode of life. All living creatures regard the procreation of offspring as<br>a source of great happiness. The procreation of offspring, however,<br>becomes impossible in any other mode of life (than domesticity). Every<br>kind of grass and straw, all plants and herbs (that yield corn or grain),<br>and others of the same class that grow on hills and mountains, have the<br>domestic mode of life for their root. Upon those depend the life of<br>living creatures. And since nothing else is seen (in the universe) than<br>life, domesticity may be looked upon as the refuge of the entire<br>universe.[1241] Who then speaks the truth that says that domesticity<br>cannot lead to the acquisition of Emancipation? Only those that are<br>destitute of faith and wisdom and penetration, only those that are<br>destitute of reputation that are idle and toil-worn, that have misery for<br>their share in consequence of their past acts, only those that are<br>destitute of learning, behold the plenitude of tranquillity in a life of<br>mendicancy. The eternal and certain distinctions (laid down in the Vedas)<br>are the causes that sustain the three worlds. That illustrious person of<br>the highest order who is conversant with the Vedas, is worshipped from<br>the very date of his birth. Besides the performance of Garbhadhana, Vedic<br>mantras become necessary for enabling persons of the regenerate classes<br>to accomplish all their acts in respect of both this and the other<br>world.[1242] In cremating his body (after death), in the matter of his<br>attainment of a second body, in that of his drink and food after such<br>attainment, in that of giving away kine and other animals for helping him<br>to cross the river that divides the region of life from that of Yama, in<br>that of sinking funeral cakes in water&#8212;Vedic mantras are necessary. Then<br>again the three classes of Pitris, viz., the Archishmats, the Varhishads,<br>and the Kravyads, approve of the necessity of mantras in the case of the<br>dead, and mantras are allowed to be efficient causes (for attainment of<br>the objects for which these ceremonies and rites have been directed to be<br>performed). When the Vedas say this so loudly and when again human beings<br>are said to owe debts to the Pitris, the Rishis, and the gods, how can<br>any one attain to Emancipation?[1243] This false doctrine (of incorporeal<br>existence called Emancipation), apparently dressed in colours of truth,<br>but subversive of the real purport of the declarations of the Vedas, has<br>been introduced by learned men reft of prosperity and eaten up by<br>idleness. That Brahmana who performs sacrifices according to the<br>declarations of the Vedas is never seduced by sin. Through sacrifices,<br>such a person attains to high regions of felicity along with the animals<br>he has slain in those sacrifices, and himself, gratified by the<br>acquisition of all his wishes succeeds in gratifying those animals by<br>fulfilling their wishes. By disregarding the Vedas, by guile, or by<br>deception, one never succeeds in attaining to the Supreme. On the other<br>hand, it is by practising the rites laid down in the Vedas that one<br>succeeds in attaining to Brahma.'<br><br>"Kapila said, '(If acts are obligatory, then) there are the Darsa, the<br>Paurnamasa, the Agnihotra, the Chaturmasya, and other acts for the man of<br>intelligence. In their performance is eternal merit. (Why then perform<br>acts involving cruelty)? Those that have betaken themselves to the<br>Sannyasa, mode of life, that abstain from all acts, that are endued with<br>patience, that are cleansed (of wrath and every fault), and that are<br>conversant with Brahma, succeed by such knowledge of Brahma in paying off<br>the debts (thou speakest of) to the gods (the Rishis, and the Pitris)<br>represented to be so very fond of libations poured in sacrifices.[1244]<br>The very gods become stupefied in tracing the track of that trackless<br>person who constitutes himself the soul of all creatures and who looks<br>upon all creatures with an equal eye. Through instructions received from<br>the preceptor one knows that which dwells within this frame to be of a<br>four-fold nature, having besides four doors and four mouths. In<br>consequence of (their possession of) two arms, the organ of speech, the<br>stomach, and the organ of pleasure, the very gods are said to have four<br>doors. One should, therefore, strive one's best to keep those doors under<br>control.[1245] One should not gamble with dice. One should not<br>appropriate what belongs to another. One should not assist at the<br>sacrifice of a person of ignoble birth. One should not, giving way to<br>wrath, smite another with hands or feet. That intelligent man who<br>conducts himself in this way is said to have his hands and feet<br>well-controlled. One should not indulge in vociferous abuse or censure.<br>One should not speak words that are vain. One should forbear from knavery<br>and from calumniating others. One should observe the vow of truthfulness,<br>be sparing of speech, and always heedful.' By conducting oneself in this<br>way one will have one's organ of speech well-restrained. One should not<br>abstain entirely from food. One should not eat too much. One should give<br>up covetousness, and always seek the companionship of the good. One<br>should eat only so much as is needed for sustaining life. By conducting<br>oneself in this way one succeeds in properly controlling the door<br>represented by one's stomach. One should not, O hero, lustfully take<br>another wife when one has a wedded spouse (with whom to perform all<br>religious acts). One should never summon a woman to bed except in her<br>season. One should confine oneself to one's own wedded spouse without<br>seeking congress with other women. By conducting oneself in this way one<br>is said to have one's organ of pleasure properly controlled. That man of<br>wisdom is truly a regenerate person who has all his four doors, viz., the<br>organ of pleasure, the stomach, the two arms (and two feet), and the<br>organ of speech, properly controlled. Everything becomes useless of that<br>person whose doors are not well-controlled. What can the penance of such<br>a man do? What can his sacrifices bring about? What cart be achieved by<br>his body? The gods know him for a Brahmana who has cast off his upper<br>garment, who sleeps on the bare ground, who makes his arm a pillow, and<br>whose heart is possessed of tranquillity.[1246] That person who, devoted<br>to contemplation, singly enjoys all the happiness that wedded couples<br>enjoy, and who turns not his attention to the joys and griefs of others,<br>should be known for a Brahmana.[1247] That man who rightly understands<br>all this as it exists in reality and its multiform transformations, and<br>who knows what the end is of all created objects, is known by the gods<br>for a Brahmana.[1248] One who hath no fear from any creature and from<br>whom no creature hath any fear and who constitutes himself the soul of<br>all creatures, should be known for a Brahmana. Without having acquired<br>purity of heart which is the true result of all pious acts such as gifts<br>and sacrifices, men of foolish understandings do not succeed in obtaining<br>a knowledge of what is needed in making one a Brahmana even when<br>explained by preceptors. Destitute of a knowledge of all this, these men<br>desire fruits of a different kind, viz., heaven and its joys.[1249]<br>Unable to practise even a small part of that good conduct which has come<br>down from remote times, which is eternal, which is characterised by<br>certitude, which enters as a thread in all our duties, and by adopting<br>which men of knowledge belonging to all the modes of life convert their<br>respective duties and penances into terrible weapons for destroying the<br>ignorance and evils of worldliness, men of foolish understandings regard<br>acts that are productive of visible fruits, that are fraught with the<br>highest puissance, and that are deathless, as fruitless after all and as<br>deviations (from the proper course) not sanctioned by the scriptures. In<br>truth, however, that conduct, embracing as it does practices the very<br>opposite of those that are seen in seasons of distress, is the very<br>essence of heedfulness and is never affected by lust and wrath and other<br>passions of a similar kind.[1250] As regards sacrifices again, it is very<br>difficult to ascertain all their particulars. If ascertained, it is very<br>difficult to observe them in practice. If practised, the fruits to which<br>they lead are terminable. Mark this well. (And marking this, do thou<br>betake thyself to the path of knowledge).'<br><br>"Syumarasmi said, 'The Vedas countenance acts and discountenance them.<br>Whence then is their authority when their declarations thus contradict<br>each other? Renunciation of acts, again, is productive of great benefit.<br>Both these have been indicated in the Vedas. Do thou discourse to me on<br>this subject, O Brahmana!'<br><br>"Kapila said, 'Betaking yourselves to the path of the good (viz., Yoga),<br>do you even in this life realise its fruits by the direct evidence of<br>your senses. What, however, are the visible results of those other<br>objects which you (men of acts) pursue?'<br><br>"Syumarasmi said, 'O Brahmana, I am Syumarasmi by name. I have come here<br>for acquiring knowledge. Desirous of doing good to myself I have started<br>this conversation in artless candour and not from desire of disputation.<br>The dark doubt has taken possession of my mind. O illustrious one, solve<br>it to me. Thou hast said that they who take the path of the good (viz.,<br>Yoga), by which Brahma is attained, realise its fruits by the direct<br>evidence of their senses. What, indeed, is that which is so realisable by<br>the direct evidence of the senses and which is pursued by yourselves?<br>Avoiding all sciences that have disputation only for their foremost<br>object, I have so studied the Agama as to have July mastered their true<br>meaning. By Agama I understand the declarations of the Vedas. I also<br>include la that word those sciences based on logic which have for their<br>object the bringing out of the real meaning of the Vedas.[1251] Without<br>avoiding the duties laid down for the particular mode of life which one<br>may lead, one should pursue the practices laid down in Agama. Such<br>observance of the practices laid down in Agama crowns one with success.<br>In consequence of the certainty of the conclusions of Agama, the success<br>to which the latter leads may be said to be almost realisable by direct<br>evidence. As a boat that is tied to another bound for a different port,<br>cannot take its passengers to the port they desire to reach, even so<br>ourselves, dragged by our acts due to past desires, can never cross the<br>interminable river of birth and death (and reach the heaven of rest and<br>peace we may have in view). Discourse to me on this topic, O illustrious<br>one! Teach me as a preceptor teaches a disciple. No one can be found<br>amongst men that has completely renounced all worldly objects, nor one<br>that is perfectly contented with oneself, nor one that has transcended<br>grief, nor one that is perfectly free from disease, nor one that is<br>absolutely free from the desire to act (for one's own benefit), nor one<br>that has an absolute distaste for companionship, nor one that has<br>entirely abstained from acts of every kind. Even men like yourself are<br>seen to give way to joy and indulge in grief as persons like ourselves.<br>Like other creatures the senses of persons like yourselves have their<br>functions and objects. Tell me, in what then, if we are to investigate<br>the question of happiness, does pure felicity consist for all the four<br>orders of men and all the four modes of life who and which have, as<br>regards their inclinations, the same resting ground.'<br><br>"Kapila said, 'Whatever the Sastras according to which one performs the<br>acts one feels inclined to do, the ordinances laid down in it for<br>regulating those acts never become fruitless. Whatever again the school<br>of opinion according to which one may conduct oneself, one is sure to<br>attain to the highest end by only observing the duties of self-restraint<br>of Yoga. Knowledge assists that man in crossing (this interminable river<br>of life and death) who pursues knowledge. That conduct, however, which<br>men pursue after deviating from the path of knowledge, afflicts them (by<br>subjecting them to the evils of life and death). It is evident that ye<br>are possessed of knowledge and dissociated from every worldly object that<br>may produce distress. But have any of you at any time succeeded in<br>acquiring that knowledge in consequence of which everything is capable of<br>being viewed as identical with one Universal Soul?[1252] Without a<br>correct apprehension of the scriptures, some there are, fond only of<br>disputation, who, in consequence of being overwhelmed by desire and<br>aversion, become the slaves of pride and arrogance. Without having<br>correctly understood the meaning of scriptural declarations, these<br>robbers of the scriptures, these depredators of Brahma, influenced by<br>arrogance and error, refuse to pursue tranquillity and practise<br>self-restraint.[1253] These men behold fruitlessness on every side, and<br>if (by chance) they succeed in obtaining the puissance of knowledge they<br>never impart it to others for rescuing them. Made up entirely of the<br>quality of Tamas, they have Tamas only for their refuge. One becomes<br>subject to all the incidents of that nature which one imbibes.<br>Accordingly, of him who hath Tamas for his refuge, the passions of envy,<br>lust, wrath, pride, falsehood, and vanity, continually grow, for one's<br>qualities have one's nature for their spring. Thinking in this strain and<br>beholding these faults (through the aid of instructions secured from<br>preceptors), Yatis, who covet the highest end, betake themselves to Yoga,<br>leaving both good and ill.'[1254]<br><br>"Syumarasmi said, 'O Brahmana, all that I have said (about the laudable<br>character of acts and the opposite character of Renunciation) is strictly<br>conformable to the scriptures. It is, however, very true that without a<br>correct apprehension of the meaning of the scriptures, one does not feel<br>inclined to obey what the scriptures really declare. Whatever conduct is<br>consistent with equity is consistent with the scriptures. Even that is<br>what the Sruti declares. Similarly, whatever conduct is inconsistent with<br>equity is inconsistent with the scriptures. This also is declared by the<br>Sruti. It is certain that no one can do an act that is scriptural by<br>transgressing the scriptures. That again is unscriptural which is against<br>the Vedas. The Sruti declares this. Many men, who believe only what<br>directly appeals to their senses, behold only this world (and not what is<br>addressed in the scriptures to Faith). They do not behold what the<br>scriptures declare to be faults. They have, accordingly, like ourselves,<br>to give way to grief. Those objects of the senses with which men like you<br>are concerned are the same with which other living creatures are<br>concerned. Yet in consequence of your knowledge of the soul and their<br>ignorance of it, how vast is the difference that exists between you and<br>them! All the four orders of men and all the four modes of life, however<br>different their duties, seek the same single end (viz., the highest<br>happiness). Thou art possessed of unquestioned talents and abilities. For<br>ascertaining that particular course of conduct (amongst those various<br>duties) which is well calculated to accomplish the desired end, thou<br>hast, by discoursing to me on the Infinite (Brahma), filled my soul with<br>tranquillity. As regards ourselves, in consequence of our inability to<br>understand the Soul we are destitute of a correct apprehension of the<br>reality. Our wisdom is concerned with things that are low, and we are<br>enveloped in thick darkness. (The course of conduct, however, that thou<br>hast indicated for enabling one to attain to Emancipation, is exceedingly<br>difficult of practice). Only he who is devoted to Yoga, who has<br>discharged all his duties, who is capable of roving everywhere depending<br>only on his own body, who has brought his soul under perfect control, who<br>has transcended the requirements of the science of morality and who<br>disregards the whole world (and everything belonging to it), can<br>transgress the declarations of the Vedas with respect to acts, and say<br>that there is Emancipation.[1255] For one, however, who lives in the<br>midst of relatives, this course of conduct is exceedingly difficult to<br>follow. Gift, study of the Vedas, sacrifices, begetting offspring,<br>simplicity of dealing, when by practising even these no one succeeds in<br>attaining to Emancipation, fie on him who seeks to attain to it, and on<br>Emancipation itself that is sought! It seems that the labour spent upon<br>attaining to it is all fruitless. One becomes chargeable with atheism if<br>one disregards the Vedas by not doing the acts they direct. O illustrious<br>one, I desire to hear without delay about that (Emancipation) which comes<br>in the Vedas after the declarations in favour of acts. Do tell me the<br>truth, O Brahmana! I sit at thy feet as a disciple. Teach me kindly! I<br>wish to know as much about Emancipation as is known to thee, O learned<br>one!'
