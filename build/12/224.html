                            "Bhishma said, 'Once more, laughing at Vali who was sighing like a snake,<br>Sakra addressed him for saying something more pointed than what had said<br>before.[837]<br><br>"Sakra said, 'Formerly, attended by a train consisting of thousands of<br>vehicles and kinsmen, thou usedst to make thy progresses, scorching all<br>the worlds with thy splendour and regarding us as nought. Thou art now,<br>however, deserted by both kinsmen and friends. Beholding this miserable<br>plight that has overtaken thee, dost thou or dost thou not indulge in<br>grief? Formerly, all the worlds were under thy sway and great was thy<br>joy. I ask, dost thou or dost thou not indulge in grief now, for this<br>fall of thine in respect of external splendour?'<br><br>"Vali said, 'Considering all this to be transitory,&#8212;due, indeed, to the<br>course of time,&#8212;I do not, O Sakra, indulge in grief. These things have<br>an end. These bodies that creatures have, O chief of celestials, are all<br>transitory. For that reason, O Sakra, I do not grieve (for this asinine<br>form of mine). Nor is this form due to any fault of mine. The animating<br>principle and the body come into existence together, in consequence of<br>their own nature. They grow together, and meet with destruction together.<br>Having obtained this form of existence I have not been permanently<br>enslaved by it. Since I know this, I have no cause for sorrow in<br>consequence of that knowledge. As the final resting-place of all rivers<br>is the ocean, even so the end of all embodied creatures is death. Those<br>persons that know this well are never stupefied, O wielder of the<br>thunderbolt! They, however, who are overwhelmed with Passion and loss of<br>judgment, do not know this, they whose understanding is lost, sink under<br>the weight of misfortune. A person who acquires a keen understanding<br>succeeds in destroying all his sins. A sinless person acquires the<br>attribute of Goodness, and having acquired it becomes cheerful. They,<br>however, that deviate from the attribute of Goodness, and obtain repeated<br>rebirths, are obliged to indulge in sorrow and grief, led on by desire<br>and the objects of the senses. Success or the reverse, in respect of the<br>attainment of all objects of desire, life or death, the fruits of action<br>that are represented by pleasure or pain, I neither dislike nor like.<br>When one slays another, one slays only that other's body. That man, who<br>thinks that it is he who slays another, is himself slain. Indeed, both of<br>them are ignorant of the truth, viz., he who slays and he who is<br>slain.[838] That person, O Maghavat, who having killed or vanquished any<br>one brags of his manliness, should know that he is not the actor but the<br>act (of which he boasts) has been accomplished by a real agent (who is<br>different). When the question comes as to who is it that causes the<br>creation and the destruction of things in the world, it is generally<br>regarded that some person (who has himself been caused or created) has<br>caused the act (of creation or destruction). Know, however, that the<br>person who is so regarded has (as already said) a creator. Earth, light<br>or heat, space, water, and wind constituting the fifth&#8212;from these do all<br>creatures spring. (When this is known to me) what sorrow can I feel (for<br>this change in my condition)? one that is possessed of great learning,<br>one that has not much of learning, one that is possessed of strength, one<br>that is destitute of strength, one that is possessed of personal beauty,<br>and one that is very ugly, one that is fortunate and one that is not<br>blessed by fortune, are all swept away by Time, which is too deep to be<br>fathomed, by its own energy. When I know that I have been vanquished by<br>Time, what sorrow can I feel (for this alteration in my circumstances)?<br>One that burns anything burns a thing that has been already burnt. One<br>that slays, only slays a victim already slain. One that is destroyed has<br>been before destroyed. A thing that is acquired by a person is that which<br>is already arrived and intended for his acquisition. This Time is like an<br>ocean. There is no island in it. Where, indeed, is its other shore? Its<br>boundary cannot be seen. Reflecting even deeply, I do not behold the end<br>of this continuous stream that is the great ordainer of all things and<br>that is certainly celestial. If I did not understand that it is Time that<br>destroys all creatures, then, perhaps, I would have felt the emotions of<br>joy and pride and wrath, O lord of Sachi! Hast thou come here to condemn<br>me, having ascertained that I am now bearing the form of an ass that<br>subsists upon chaff and that is now passing his days in a lonely spot<br>remote from the habitations of men? If I wish, even now I can assume<br>various awful forms beholding any one of which thou wouldst beat a hasty<br>retreat from my presence. It is Time that gives everything and again<br>takes away everything. It is Time that ordains all things. Do not, O<br>Sakra, brag of thy manliness. Formerly, O Purandara, on occasions of my<br>wrath everything used to become agitated. I am acquainted, however, O<br>Sakra, with the eternal attributes of all things in the world. Do thou<br>also know the truth. Do not suffer thyself to be filled with wonder.<br>Affluence and its origin are not under one's control. Thy mind seems to<br>be like that of a child. It is the same as it was before. Open thy eyes,<br>O Maghavat, and adopt an understanding established on certitude and<br>truth. The gods, men, the Pitris, the Gandharvas, the snakes, and the<br>Rakshasas, were all under my sway in days gone by. Thou knowest this, O<br>Vasava! Their understandings stupefied by ignorance, all creatures used<br>to flatter me, saying, 'Salutations to that point of the compass whither<br>Virochana's son Vali may now be staying!' O lord of Sachi, I do not at<br>all grieve when I think of that honour (which is no longer paid to me). I<br>feel no sorrow for this fall of mine. My understanding is firm in this<br>respect, viz., that I will live obedient to the sway of the Ordainer. It<br>is seen that some one of noble birth, possessed of handsome features, and<br>endued with great prowess, lives in misery, with all his counsellors and<br>friends. This happens because of its having been ordained.[839]<br>Similarly, some one born in an ignoble race, devoid of knowledge, and<br>with even a stain on his birth, is seen, O Sakra, to live in happiness<br>with all his counsellors and friends.<br><br>This also happens because of its having been ordained. An auspicious and<br>beautiful woman, O Sakra, is seen to pass her life in misery. Similarly,<br>an ugly woman with every inauspicious mark is seen to pass her days in<br>great happiness. That we have now become so is not due to any act of<br>ours, O Sakra! That thou art now so is not due, O wielder of the<br>thunderbolt, to any act of thine. Thou hast not done anything, O thou of<br>hundred sacrifices, in consequence of which thou art now enjoying this<br>affluence. Nor have I done anything in consequence of which I have now<br>been divested of affluence, Affluence and its reverse come one after<br>another. I now behold thee blazing with splendour, endued with<br>prosperity, possessed of beauty, placed at the head of all the deities,<br>and thus roaring at me. This would never be but for the fact of Time<br>standing near after having assailed me. Indeed, if Time had not assailed<br>me I would have today killed thee with only a blow of my fists<br>notwithstanding the fact of thy being armed with the thunder. This,<br>however, is not the time for putting forth my prowess. On the other hand,<br>the time that has come is for adopting a behaviour of peace and<br>tranquillity. It is Time that establishes all things. Time works upon all<br>things and leads them to their final consummation.[840] I was the<br>worshipped lord of the Danavas. Burning all with my energy, I used to<br>roar in strength and pride. When Time hath assailed even myself, who is<br>there whom he will not assail? Formerly, O chief of the deities, singly I<br>bore the energy of all the twelve illustrious Adityas with thyself<br>amongst them. It was I that used to bear up water and then to shower it<br>as rain, O Vasava! It was I that used to give both light and heat unto<br>the three worlds. It was I that used to protect and it was I that used to<br>destroy. It was I that gave and it was I that took. It was I that used to<br>bind and it was I that used to unbind. In all the worlds I was the one<br>puissant master. That sovereign sway which I had, O chief of the<br>celestials, is no more. I am now assailed by the forces of Time. Those<br>things, therefore, are no longer seen to shine in me. I am not the doer<br>(of acts that are apparently done by me). Thou art not the doer (of acts<br>done by thee). None else, O lord of Sachi, is the doer (of those acts).<br>It is Time, O Sakra, that protects or destroys all things.[841] Persons<br>conversant with the Vedas say that Time (Eternity) is Brahma. The<br>fortnights and months are his body. That body is invested with days and<br>nights as its robes. The seasons are his senses. The year is his mouth.<br>Some people, in consequence of their superior intelligence, say that all<br>this (the entire universe) should be conceived as Brahma. The Vedas,<br>however, teach, that the five sheaths that invest the Soul should be<br>regarded as Brahma. Brahma is deep and inaccessible like a vast ocean of<br>waters. It hath been said that it hath neither beginning nor end, and<br>that it is both indestructible and destructible.[842] Though it is<br>without attributes by itself, yet it enters all existent objects and as<br>such assumes attributes. Those persons that are conversant with truth<br>regard Brahma as eternal. Through the action of Ignorance, Brahma causes<br>the attributes of materiality to invest the Chit or Soul which is<br>immaterial spirit (having knowledge only for its attribute). That<br>materiality, however, is not the essential attribute of the Soul, for<br>upon the appearance of a knowledge of the true cause of everything, that<br>materiality ceases to invest the Soul.[843] Brahma in the form of Time is<br>the refuge of all creatures. Where wouldst thou go transcending that<br>Time? Time or Brahma, indeed, cannot be avoided by running nor by staying<br>still. All the five senses are incapable of perceiving Brahma. Some have<br>said that Brahma is Fire; some that he is Prajapati; some that he is the<br>Seasons; some that he is the Month; some that he is the Fortnight; some<br>that he is the Days; some that he is the Hours; some that he is the<br>Morning; some that he is the Noon; some that he is the Evening; and some<br>that he is the Moment. Thus diverse people speak diversely of him who is<br>single. Know that he is Eternity, under whose sway are all things. Many<br>thousands of Indras have passed away, O Vasava, each of whom was<br>possessed of great strength and prowess. Thou also, O lord of Sachi,<br>shalt have to pass away after the same manner. Thee, too, O Sakra, that<br>art possessed of swelling might and that art the chief of the deities,<br>when thy hour comes, all-powerful Time will extinguish! Time sweeps away<br>all things. For this reason, O Indra, do not brag. Time is incapable of<br>being quieted by either thee or me or by those gone before us. This regal<br>prosperity that thou hast attained and that thou thinkest to be beyond<br>comparison, had formerly been possessed by me. It is unsubstantial and<br>unreal. She does not dwell long in one place. Indeed, she had dwelt in<br>thousands of Indras before thee, all of whom, again, were very much<br>superior to thee. Unstable as she is, deserting me she hath now<br>approached thee, O chief of the deities! Do not, O Sakra, indulge in such<br>brag again. It behoveth thee to become tranquil. Knowing thee to be full<br>of vanity, she will very soon desert thee.'"
