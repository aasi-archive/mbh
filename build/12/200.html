                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, what reply was given by either<br>the Brahmana or the monarch to Virupa after the conclusion of the<br>latter's speech. What kind of end was it, amongst those described by<br>thee, that they obtained? What, indeed, was the discourse that happened<br>between them, and what did they do there?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The Brahmana, saying, 'Let it be as thou hast said,<br>'worshipped Dharma and Yama and Time and Mrityu and Heaven, all of whom<br>were worthy of worship. He also worshipped all those foremost of<br>Brahmanas that had come there by bending his head unto them. Addressing<br>the monarch then, he said, 'Endued with the reward of my recitations, O<br>royal sage, attain thou to a position of eminence. With thy leave I shall<br>set myself to my recitations again. O thou of great might, the goddess<br>Savitri gave me a boon, saying, 'Let thy devotion to recitations be<br>continuous.'<br><br>"The king said, 'If thy success (in recitation) has b.-come fruitless (in<br>consequence of thy having given away those fruits unto me), and if thy<br>heart be set upon practising again, go, O learned Brahmana, half and half<br>with me, and let the reward of thy recitations themselves be thine.'[648]<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'Thou hast made strenuous efforts before all these<br>persons (for making me a sharer of the rewards in store for thee as the<br>consequences of thy own acts). Let us then become equal in respect of our<br>rewards (in next life), and let us go to receive that end which is ours.'<br>Knowing the resolve to which they came there, the chief of the gods came<br>to that spot, accompanied by the deities and the Regents of the world.<br>The Sadhyas, the Viswas, the Mantras, diverse kinds of loud and sweet<br>music, the Rivers, the Mountains, the Seas, the Sacred Waters, the<br>Penances, the Ordinances about yoga, the Vedas, the Sounds that accompany<br>the singing of the Samans, Saraswati, Narada, Parvata, Viswavasu, the<br>Hahas, the Huhus, the Gandharva Chitrasena with all the members of his<br>family, the Nagas, the Sadhyas, the Munis, the god of gods, viz.,<br>Prajapati, and the inconceivable and thousand-headed Vishnu himself, came<br>there. Drums and trumpets were beat and blown in the firmament. Celestial<br>flowers were rained down upon those high-souled beings. Bands of Apsaras<br>danced all around. Heaven, in his embodied form, came there. Addressing<br>the Brahmana, he said, 'Thou hast attained to success. Thou art highly<br>blessed.' Next addressing the monarch, he said, 'Thou also, O king, hast<br>attained to success.' Those two persons then, O monarch (viz., the<br>Brahmana and the king), having done good to each other, withdrew their<br>senses from the objects of the world. Fixing the vital breaths Prana,<br>Apana, Samana, Udana and Vyana in the heart, they concentrated the mind<br>in Prana and Apana united together. They then placed the two united<br>breaths in the abdomen, and directed their gaze to the tip of the nose<br>and then immediately below the two eye-brows. They next held the two<br>breaths, with the aid of the mind, in the spot that intervenes between<br>the two eye-brows, bringing them there very gradually. With bodies<br>perfectly inactive, they were absorbed with fixed gaze. Having control<br>over their souls, they then placed the soul within the brain. Then<br>piercing the crown of the high-souled Brahmana a fiery flame of great<br>splendour ascended to heaven. Loud exclamations of woe, uttered by all<br>creatures, were then heard on all sides. Its praises hymned by all, that<br>splendour then entered Brahman's self. The Great grandsire, advancing<br>forward, addressed that splendour which had assumed a form of the<br>tallness of a span, saying, 'Welcome!' And once more he uttered these<br>words, 'Verily, Reciters attain to the same end with the yogins. The<br>attainment by the yogin of his end is an object of direct vision unto all<br>these (here assembled). As regards Reciters, there is this distinction,<br>that the honour is ordained for them of Brahman's advancing forward to<br>receive them (after their departure from earth).[649] Dwell thou in me.'<br>Thus spoke Brahman and once more imparted consciousness into that<br>splendour. Indeed, the Brahmana then, freed from all anxieties, entered<br>the mouth of the Creator. The monarch (Ikshvaku) also, after the same<br>manner, entered the divine Grandsire like that foremost of Brahmanas. The<br>(assembled) deities saluted the self-born and said, 'A very superior end<br>is, indeed, ordained for Reciters. This exertion (that we have seen thee<br>put forth) is for Reciters. As regards ourselves, we came hither for<br>beholding it. Thou hast made these two equal, rendered them equal honour,<br>and bestowed upon them an equal end. The high end that is reserved for<br>both yogins and Reciters has been seen by us today. Transcending all<br>regions (of felicity), these two are capable of going whithersoever they<br>wish.'<br><br>"Brahman said, 'He also that would read the great Smriti (viz., the<br>Veda), and he too, who would read the other auspicious Smritis that<br>follow the former (viz., Manu's and the rest), would, in this way, attain<br>to the same region with me. He also who is devoted to yoga, will, without<br>doubt, acquire in this manner, after death, the regions that are mine. I<br>go hence. Go ye all to your respective places for the accomplishment of<br>your ends.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Having said these words, that foremost of gods<br>disappeared there and then. The assembled deities, having previously<br>taken his leave, returned to their respective abodes. All those<br>high-souled beings, having honoured Dharma, proceeded with well-pleased<br>hearts, O monarch, walking behind that great deity. These are the rewards<br>of reciters and this their end. I have described them to thee as I myself<br>had heard of them. What else, O monarch, dost thou wish to hear of?'"
