                            "Bhishma said, 'Then upon the expiration of the great Kalpa, when the<br>celestial Purohita Vrihaspati was born in the race of Angiras, all the<br>deities became very happy. The words, Vrihat, Brahma, and Mahat all bear<br>the same sense.[1800] The celestial Purohita, O king came to be called<br>Vrihaspati because he was endued with all these attributes. King<br>Uparichara, otherwise called Vasu, became a disciple of Vrihaspati and<br>soon became the foremost of his disciples. Admitted as such, he began to<br>study at the feet of his preceptor that science which was composed by the<br>seven Rishis who were (otherwise) known by the name of Chitrasikhandins.<br>With soul cleansed from all sorts of evil by sacrifices and other<br>religious rites, he ruled the Earth like Indra ruling the Heaven. The<br>illustrious king performed a great Horse-sacrifice in which his preceptor<br>Vrihaspati became the Hota. The sons of Prajapati (Brahman) themselves,<br>viz., Ekata, Dwita, and Trita, became the Sadasyas in that<br>sacrifice.[1801] There were others also who became Sadasyas in that<br>sacrifice, viz., Dhanusha, Raivya, Arvavasu, Parvavasu, the Rishi<br>Medhatithi, the great Rishi Tandya, the blessed Rishi Santi, otherwise<br>called Vedasiras, the foremost of Rishis, viz., Kapila, who was the<br>father of Salihotra, the first Kalpa, Tittiri the elder brother of<br>Vaisampayana, Kanwa, and Devahotra, in all forming sixteen. In that great<br>sacrifice, O monarch, all the requisite articles were collected. No<br>animals were slain in it. The king had ordained it so. He was full of<br>compassion. Of pure and liberal mind, he had cast off all desires, and<br>was well-conversant with all rites. The requisites of that sacrifice all<br>consisted of the products of the wilderness. The ancient God of gods<br>(viz., Hari), became highly gratified with the king on account of that<br>sacrifice. Incapable of being seen by any one else, the great God showed<br>himself to his worshipper. Accepting by taking its scent, the share<br>offered to him he himself took up the Purodasa.[1802] The great God took<br>up the offerings without being seen by any one. At this, Vrihaspati<br>became angry. Taking up the ladle he hurled it with violence at the sky,<br>and began to shed tears in wrath. Addressing king Uparichara he<br>said,&#8212;Here, I place this as Narayana's share of the sacrificial<br>offerings. Without doubt, he shall take it before my eyes.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'In the great sacrifice of Uparichara, all the<br>deities appeared in their respective forms for taking their shares of the<br>sacrificial offerings and were seen by all. Why is it that the puissant<br>Hari only acted otherwise by invisibly taking his share?'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'When Vrihaspati gave way to wrath, the great king<br>Vasu and all his Sadasyas sought to pacify the great Rishi. With cool<br>heads, all of them addressed Vrihaspati, saying,&#8212;It behoveth thee not to<br>give way to anger. In this Krita age, this anger to which thou hast given<br>way, should not be the characteristic of any one. The great deity for<br>whom the share of the sacrificial offerings was designed by thee, is<br>himself free from anger. He is incapable of being seen either by<br>ourselves or by thee, O Vrihaspati! Only he can see Him to whom He<br>becomes gracious.&#8212;Then the Rishis Ekata, Dwita, and Trita, who were well<br>conversant with the science of morality and duties compiled by the seven<br>Rishis, addressed that conclave and began the following narration.&#8212;We<br>are the sons of Brahman, begotten by a fiat of his will (and not in the<br>ordinary way). Once on a time we repaired to the north for obtaining what<br>is for our highest good. Having undergone penances for thousands of years<br>and acquired great ascetic merit, we again stood on only one foot like<br>fixed stakes of wood. The country where we underwent the austerest of<br>penances, lies to the north of the mountains of Meru and on the shores of<br>the Ocean of Milk. The object we had in mind was how to behold the divine<br>Narayana in his own form. Upon the completion of our penances and after<br>we had performed the final ablutions, an incorporeal voice was heard by<br>us, O puissant Vrihaspati, at once deep as that of the clouds and<br>exceedingly sweet and filling the heart with joy. The voice said,&#8212;Ye<br>Brahmanas, well have ye performed these penances with cheerful souls.<br>Devoted unto Narayana, ye seek to know how ye may succeed in beholding<br>that god of great puissance! On the northern shores of the Ocean of Milk<br>there is an island of great splendour called by the name of White Island.<br>The men that inhabit that island have complexions as white as the rays of<br>the Moon and that are devoted to Narayana. Worshippers of that foremost<br>of all Beings, they are devoted to Him with their whole souls. They all<br>enter that eternal and illustrious deity of a thousand rays.[1803] They<br>are divested of senses. They do not subsist on any kind of food. Their<br>eyes are winkless. Their bodies always emit a fragrance. Indeed, the<br>denizens of White Island believe and worship only one God. Go thither, ye<br>ascetics, for there I have revealed myself!&#8212;All of us, hearing these<br>incorporeal words, proceeded by the way indicated to the country<br>described. Eagerly desirous of beholding Him and our hearts full of Him,<br>we arrived at last at that large island called White Island. Arrived<br>there, we could see nothing. Indeed, our vision was blinded by the energy<br>of the great deity and accordingly we could not see Him.[1804] At this,<br>the idea, due to the grace of the great God Himself, arose in our minds<br>that one that had not undergone sufficient penances could not speedily<br>behold Narayana. Under the influence of this idea we once more set<br>ourselves to the practice of some severe austerities, suited to the time<br>and place, for a hundred years. Upon the completion of our vows, we<br>beheld a number of men of auspicious features. All of them were white and<br>looked like the Moon (in colour) and possessed of every mark of<br>blessedness. Their hands were always joined in prayer. The faces of some<br>were turned towards the North and of some towards the East. They were<br>engaged in silently thinking on Brahma.[1805] The Yapa performed by those<br>high-souled persons was a mental yapa (and did not consist of the actual<br>recitation of any mantras in words). In consequence of their hearts<br>having been entirely set upon Him, Hari became highly pleased with them.<br>The effulgence that was emitted by each of those men resembled, O<br>foremost of ascetics, the splendours which Surya assumes when the time<br>comes for the dissolution of the universe. Indeed, we thought that Island<br>was the home of all Energy. All the inhabitants were perfectly equal in<br>energy. There was no superiority or inferiority there among them.[1806]<br>We then suddenly beheld once more a light arise, that seemed to be the<br>concentrated effulgence of a thousand Suns, O Vrihaspati. The<br>inhabitants, assembling together, ran towards that light, with hands<br>joined in reverential attitude, full of joy, and uttering the one word<br>Namas (we bow thee!) We then heard a very loud noise uttered by all of<br>them together. It seemed that those men were employed in offering a<br>sacrifice to the great God. As regards ourselves, we were suddenly<br>deprived of our senses by his Energy. Deprived of vision and strength and<br>all the senses, we could not see or feel anything.[1807] We only heard a<br>loud volume of sound uttered by the assembled inhabitants. It<br>said,&#8212;Victory to thee, O thou of eyes like lotus-petals! Salutations to<br>thee, O Creator of the universe! Salutations to thee, O Hrishikesa, O<br>foremost of Beings, O thou that art the First-born! Even this was the<br>sound we heard, uttered distinctly and agreeably to the rules of<br>orthoepy.[1808] Meanwhile, a breeze, fragrant and pure, blew, bearing<br>perfumes of celestial flowers, and of certain herbs and plants that were<br>of use on the occasion. Those men, endued with great devotion, possessed<br>of hearts full of reverence, conversant with the ordinances laid down in<br>the Pancharatra, were then worshipping the great deity with mind, word,<br>and deed.[1809] Without doubt, Hari appeared in that place whence the<br>sound we heard arose. As regards ourselves, stupefied by His illusion, we<br>could not see him. After the breeze had ceased and the sacrifice had been<br>over, our hearts became agitated with anxiety, O foremost one of Angira's<br>race. As we stood among those thousands of men all of whom were of pure<br>descent, no one honoured us with a glance or nod. Those ascetics, all of<br>whom were cheerful and filled with devotion and who were all practising<br>the Brahma-frame of mind, did not show any kind of feeling for us.[1810]<br>We had been exceedingly tired. Our penances had emaciated us. At that<br>time, an incorporeal Being addressed us from the sky and said unto us<br>these words&#8212;These white men, who are divested of all outer senses, are<br>competent to behold (Narayana). Only those foremost of regenerate persons<br>whom these white men honoured with their glances, become competent to<br>behold the great God.[1811] Go hence, ye Munis, to the place whence ye<br>have come. That great Deity is incapable of being ever seen by one that<br>is destitute of devotion. Incapable of being seen in consequence of his<br>dazzling effulgence, that illustrious Deity can be beheld by only those<br>persons that in course of long ages succeed in devoting themselves wholly<br>and solely to Him. Ye foremost of regenerate one, ye have a great duty to<br>per-form. After the expiration of this the Krita age, when the Treta age<br>comes in course of the Vivaswat cycle, a great calamity will overtake the<br>worlds. Ye Munis, ye shall then have to become the allies of the deities<br>(for dispelling that calamity).&#8212;Having heard these wonderful words that<br>were sweet as nectar, we soon got back to the place we desired, through<br>the grace of that great Deity. When with the aid of even such austere<br>penances and of offerings devoutly given in sacrifices, we failed to have<br>a sight of the great Deity, how, indeed, can you expect to behold Him so<br>easily? Narayana is a Great Being, He is the Creator of the universe. He<br>is adorned in sacrifices with offerings of clarified butter and other<br>food dedicated with the aid of Vedic mantras. He has no beginning and no<br>end. He is Unmanifest. Both the Deities and the Danavas worship<br>Him.&#8212;Induced by these words spoken by Ekata and approved by his<br>companions, viz., Dwita and Trita, and solicited also by the other<br>Sadasyas, the high-minded Vrihaspati brought that sacrifice to a<br>completion after duly offering the accustomed adorations to the Deities.<br>King Uparichara also, having completed his great sacrifice, began to rule<br>his subjects righteously. At last, casting off his body, he ascended to<br>heaven. After some time, through the curse of the Brahmanas, he fell down<br>from those regions of felicity and sank deep into the bowels of the<br>Earth. King Vasu, O tiger among monarchs, was always devoted to the true<br>religion. Although sunk deep into the bowels of the Earth, his devotion<br>to virtue did not abate. Ever devoted to Narayana, and ever reciting<br>sacred mantras having Narayana for their deity, he once more ascended to<br>heaven through Narayana's grace. Ascending from the bowels of the Earth,<br>king Vasu in consequence of the very highest end that he attained,<br>proceeded to a spot that is even higher than the region of Brahman<br>himself.'"[1812]
