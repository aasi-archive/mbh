                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, that conduct by which a king<br>succeeds in aggrandising his subjects and earning regions of felicity in<br>the other world.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The king should be liberal and should perform sacrifices,<br>O Bharata! He should be observant of vows and penances, and should be<br>devoted to the duty of protecting his subjects. Righteously protecting<br>all his subjects, he should honour all righteous persons by standing up<br>when they come and by making gifts unto them. If the king regards it,<br>righteousness becomes regarded everywhere. Whatever acts and things are<br>liked by the king are liked by his subjects. Unto his foes the king<br>should always be like Death, with the rod of chastisement uplifted in his<br>hands. He should exterminate robbers everywhere in his kingdom and never<br>pardon any one from caprice. The king, O Bharata, earns a fourth part of<br>the merit that his subjects earn under his protection. By only protecting<br>his subjects the king acquires a fourth part of the merit that his<br>subjects acquire by study, by gifts, by pouring libations, and by<br>worshipping the gods. The king acquires a fourth part also of the sin<br>that his subjects commit in consequence of any distress in the kingdom<br>arising from the king's neglect in discharging the duty of protection.<br>Some say that the king earns a moiety, and some say the full measure, of<br>whatever sin is caused by his becoming cruel and untruthful in speech.<br>Listen now to the means by which the king may be cleansed of such sins.<br>If the king fails to restore to a subject the wealth that has been stolen<br>away by thieves, he should then compensate the injured from his own<br>treasury, or, in case of inability, with wealth obtained from his<br>dependents. All the orders should protect the wealth of a Brahmana even<br>as they should the Brahmana's boy or life. The person that offends<br>against Brahmanas should be exiled from the kingdom. Everything is<br>protected by protecting the Brahmana's wealth. Through the grace of the<br>Brahmana, which may thus be secured, the king becomes crowned with<br>success. Men seek the protection of a competent king like creatures<br>seeking relief from the clouds or birds seeking refuge in a large tree. A<br>cruel and covetous king, with lustful soul and ever seeking the<br>gratification of his desire never succeeds in protecting his subjects.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira, said, 'I do not, for a moment, desire the happiness that<br>sovereignty bestows or sovereignty itself for its own sake. I desire it,<br>however, for the sake of the merit one may acquire from it. It seems to<br>me that no merit is attached to it. No need for sovereignty then by which<br>no merit can be acquired. I shall, therefore, retire into the woods from<br>desire of earning merit. Laying aside the rod of chastisement, and<br>subduing my senses, I shall go to the woods which are sacred and seek to<br>acquire the merit of righteousness by becoming an ascetic subsisting upon<br>fruit and roots.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I know, O Yudhishthira, what the nature of thy heart is,<br>and how inoffensive is thy disposition. Thou wilt not, however, by<br>inoffensiveness alone, succeed in ruling thy kingdom. Thy heart is<br>inclined to mildness, thou art compassionate, and thou art exceedingly<br>righteous. Thou art without energy, and thou art virtuous and full of<br>mercy. People, therefore, do not regard thee much. Follow the conduct of<br>thy sire and grandsire. Kings should never adopt that conduct which thou<br>desirest to adopt. Never be touched by such anxiety (after doing thy<br>duty), and never adopt such inoffensiveness of conduct. By becoming so,<br>thou wouldst not succeed in earning that merit of righteousness which<br>arises from protecting subjects. The behaviour thou wishest to adopt,<br>impelled by thy own intelligence and wisdom, is not consistent with those<br>blessings which thy sire Pandu or thy mother Kunti used to solicit for<br>thee. Thy sire always solicited for thee courage, might, and truth. Kunti<br>always solicited for thee high-mindedness and liberality. The offerings<br>with Swaha and Swadha in Sraddhas and sacrifices are always asked from<br>children by the Pitris and the deities. Whether gifts and study and<br>sacrifices and the protection of subjects be meritorious or sinful, thou<br>hast been born to practise and perform them. The fame, O son of Kunti, is<br>never tarnished of men that even fail in bearing the burdens which are<br>placed on them and unto which they are yoked in life. Even a horse, if<br>properly trained, succeeds in bearing, without falling down, a burden.<br>(What need then be said of thee that art a human being?) One incurs no<br>censure if only one's acts and words be proper, for success is said to<br>depend upon acts (and words). No person, be he a man virtuously following<br>the domestic mode of life, or be he a king, or be he a Brahmacharin, has<br>ever succeeded in conducting himself without tripping. It is better to do<br>an act which is good and in which there is small merit than to totally<br>abstain from all acts, for total abstention from acts is very sinful.<br>When a high-born and righteous person succeeds in obtaining affluence,<br>the king then succeeds in obtaining prosperity in all his affairs. A<br>virtuous king, having obtained a kingdom, should seek to subdue some by<br>gifts, some by force, and some by sweet words. There is no one more<br>virtuous than he upon whom high-born and learned persons rely from fear<br>of losing their means of sustenance and depending upon whom they live in<br>contentment.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'What acts, O sire, are conductive to heaven? What is<br>the nature of the great felicity that is derived from them? What also is<br>the high prosperity that may be obtained thence? Tell me all this, if<br>thou knowest.,<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'That man from whom a person afflicted with fear obtains<br>relief even for a moment, is the most worthy of heaven amongst us. This<br>that I tell thee is very true. Be thou cheerfully the king of the Kurus,<br>O foremost one of Kuru's race, acquire heaven, protect the good and slay<br>the wicked. Let thy friends, together with all honest men, derive their<br>support from thee, like all creatures from the deity of the clouds and<br>like birds from a large tree with delicious fruits. Men seek the<br>protection of that person who is dignified, courageous, capable of<br>smiting, compassionate, with senses under control, affectionate towards<br>all, and equitable, and just.'"
