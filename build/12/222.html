                            "Yudhishthira said, 'In this world, O Bharata, acts good and bad attach<br>themselves to man for the purpose of producing fruits for enjoyment or<br>endurance. Is man, however, to be regarded as their doer or is he not to<br>be regarded so? Doubt fills my mind with respect to this question. I<br>desire to hear this in detail from thee, O grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection, O Yudhishthira, is cited the old<br>narrative of a discourse between Prahlada and Indra. The chief of the<br>Daityas, viz., Prahlada, was unattached to all worldly objects. His sins<br>had been washed away. Of respectable parentage, he was possessed of great<br>learning. Free from stupefaction and pride, ever observant of the quality<br>of goodness, and devoted to various vows, he took praise and censure<br>equally. Possessed of self-restraint, he was then passing his time in an<br>empty chamber. Conversant with the origin and the destruction of all<br>created objects, mobile and immobile, he was never angry with things that<br>displeased him and never rejoiced at the accession of objects that were<br>agreeable. He cast an equal eye upon gold and a clump of earth. Steadily<br>engaged in study of the Soul and in acquiring Emancipation, and firm in<br>knowledge, he had arrived at fixed conclusions in respect of truth.<br>Acquainted with what is supreme and what is not so among all things,<br>omniscient and of universal sight, as he was seated one day in a solitary<br>chamber with his senses under complete control, Sakra approached him, and<br>desirous of awakening him, said these words, 'O king, I behold all those<br>qualities permanently residing in thee by which a person wins the esteem<br>of all. Thy understanding seems to be like that of a child, free from<br>attachment and aversion. Thou knowest of the Soul. What, thinkest thou,<br>is the best means by which a knowledge of the Soul may be attained? Thou<br>art now bound in cords, fallen off from thy former position, brought<br>under the sway of thy foes, and divested of prosperity. Thy present<br>circumstances are such as may well inspire grief. Yet how is it, O<br>Prahlada, that thou dost not indulge in grief? Is this due, O son of<br>Diti, to the acquisition of wisdom or is it on account of thy fortitude?<br>Behold thy calamities, O Prahlada, and yet thou seemest like one that is<br>happy and tranquil.' Thus urged by Indra, the chief of the Daityas,<br>endued with determinate conclusions in respect of truth, replied unto the<br>former in these sweet words indicative of great wisdom.'<br><br>"Prahlada said, 'He who is unacquainted with the origin and the<br>destruction of all created objects, is, in consequence of such ignorance,<br>stupefied. He, however, who is conversant with these two things, is never<br>stupefied. All kinds of entities and non-entities come into being or<br>cease in consequence of their own nature. No kind of personal exertion is<br>needed (for the production of such phenomena).[833] In the absence,<br>therefore, of personal exertion, it is evident that no personal agent<br>exists for the production of all this that we perceive. But though (in<br>reality) the person (or the chit) never does anything, yet (through the<br>influence of Ignorance) a consciousness in respect of angry overspreads<br>itself on it. He who regards himself as the doer of acts good or bad,<br>possesses a wisdom that is vitiated. Such a person is, according to my<br>judgment, unacquainted with the truth.[834] If, O Sakra, the being called<br>person were really the actor, then all acts undertaken for his own<br>benefit would certainly be crowned with success. None of those acts would<br>be defeated. Among even persons struggling their utmost the suspension of<br>what is not desired and the occurrence of what is desired are not to be<br>seen. What becomes then of personal exertion? In the case of some, we see<br>that without any exertion on their part, what is not desired is suspended<br>and what is desired is accomplished. This then must be the result of<br>Nature. Some persons again are seen to present extraordinary aspects, for<br>though possessed of superior intelligence they have to solicit wealth<br>from others that are vulgar in features and endued with little<br>intelligence. Indeed, when all qualities, good or bad, enter a person,<br>urged by Nature, what ground is there for one to boast (of one's superior<br>possessions)? All these flow from Nature. This is my settled conclusion.<br>Even Emancipation and knowledge of self, according to me, flow from the<br>same source.<br><br>"In this world all fruits, good or bad, that attach themselves to<br>persons, are regarded as the result of acts. I shall now discourse to<br>thee in full on the subject of acts. Listen to me. As a crow, while<br>eating some food, proclaims the presence of that food (to the members of<br>its species) by its repeated cawing, after the same manner all our acts<br>only proclaim the indications of Nature. He who is acquainted with only<br>the transformations of Nature but not with Nature that is supreme and<br>exists by herself, feels stupefaction in consequence of his ignorance.<br>He, however, who understands the difference between Nature and her<br>transformations is never stupefied. All existent things have their origin<br>in Nature. In consequence of one's certainty of conviction in this<br>respect, one would never be affected by pride or arrogance. When I know<br>what the origin is of all the ordinances of morality and when I am<br>acquainted with the unstability of all objects, I am incapable, O Sakra,<br>of indulging in grief. All this is endued with an end. Without<br>attachments, without pride, without desire and hope, freed from all<br>bonds, and dissociated from everything, I am passing my time in great<br>happiness, engaged in beholding the appearance and disappearance of all<br>created objects. For one that is possessed of wisdom, that is<br>self-restrained, that is contented, that is without desire and hope, and<br>that beholds all things with the light of self-knowledge, no trouble or<br>anxiety exists, O Sakra! I have no affection or aversion for either<br>Nature or her transformations. I do not behold any one now who is my foe<br>nor any one who is mine own. I do not O, Sakra, at any time covet either<br>heaven, or this world, or the nether regions. It is not the case that<br>there is no happiness in understanding the Soul. But the Soul, being<br>dissociated from everything, cannot enjoy felicity. Hence I desire<br>nothing.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'Tell me the means, O Prahlada, by which this kind of wisdom<br>may be attained and by which this kind of tranquillity may be made one's<br>own. I solicit thee.'<br><br>"Prahlada said, 'By simplicity, by heedfulness, by cleansing the Soul, by<br>mastering the passions, and by waiting upon aged seniors, O Sakra, a<br>person succeeds in attaining to Emancipation. Know this, however, that<br>one acquires wisdom from Nature, and that the acquisition of tranquillity<br>also is due to the same cause. Indeed, everything else that thou<br>perceivest is due to Nature.<br><br>"Thus addressed by the lord of the Daityas, Sakra became filled with<br>wonder, and commended those words, O king, with a cheerful heart. The<br>lord of the three worlds then, having worshipped the lord of the Daityas,<br>took his leave and proceeded to his own abode.'"
