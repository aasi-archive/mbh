                            "Vyasa said, 'Unto a disciple that wishes to enquire after Emancipation<br>after having transcended all pairs of opposites and accomplished the<br>concerns of both profit and religion, an accomplished preceptor should<br>first recount all that has been said in the foregoing section, which is<br>elaborate, on the topic of Adhyatma.[1081] Space, wind, light, water and<br>earth counted as the fifth, and bhava and abhava and time, exist in all<br>living creatures having the five for their constituent ingredients.[1082]<br>Space is unoccupied interval. The organs of hearing consist of space. One<br>conversant with the science of entities endued with form should know that<br>space has sound for its attribute. The feet (that assist at locomotion)<br>have wind for their essence. The vital breaths are made of wind. The<br>sense of touch (skin) has wind for its essence, and touch is the<br>attribute of wind. Heat, the digestive fire in the stomach, light that<br>discovers all things, the warmth that is in the body, and eye counted as<br>the fifth, are all of light which has form of diverse colours for its<br>attribute. Liquefied discharges, solubility, and all kinds of liquid<br>matter are of water. Blood, marrow, and all else (in the body) that is<br>cool, should be known to have water for their essence. The tongue is the<br>sense of taste, and taste is regarded as the attribute of water. All<br>solid substances are of earth, as also bones, teeth, nails, beard, the<br>bristles on the body, hair, nerves, sinews, and skin. The nose is called<br>the sense of scent. The object of that sense, viz., scent, should be<br>known as the attribute of earth. Each subsequent element possesses the<br>attribute or attributes of the preceding one besides its own. [1083] In<br>all living creatures again are the (three) supplementary entities (viz.,<br>avidya, kama, and karma).[1084] The Rishis thus declared the five<br>elements and the effects and attributes flowing from or belonging to<br>them. The mind forms the ninth in the calculation, and the understanding<br>is regarded as the tenth. The Soul, which is infinite, is called the<br>eleventh. It is regarded as this all and as the highest. The mind has<br>doubt for its essence. The understanding discriminates and causes<br>certainty. The Soul (which, as already said, is infinite), becomes known<br>as Jiva invested with body (or jivatman) through consequences derived<br>from acts.[1085] That man who looketh upon the entire assemblage of<br>living creatures to be unstained, though endued with all these entities<br>having time for their essence, has never to recur to acts affected by<br>error.'"[1086]
