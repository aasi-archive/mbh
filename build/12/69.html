                            "Yudhishthira said, 'What other special duties remain for the king to<br>discharge? How should he protect his kingdom and how subdue his foes? How<br>should he employ his spies? How should he inspire confidence in the four<br>orders of his subjects, his own servants, wives, and sons, O Bharata?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O monarch, with attention to the diverse duties<br>of kings,&#8212;to those acts which the king or one that is in the position of<br>a king should first do. The king should first subdue himself and then<br>seek to subdue his foes. How should a king who has not been able to<br>conquer his own self be able to conquer his foes? The conquest of these,<br>viz., the aggregate of five, is regarded as the conquest of self. The<br>king that has succeeded in subduing his senses is competent to resist his<br>foes. He should place bodies of foot-soldiers in his forts, frontiers,<br>towns, parks, and pleasure gardens, O delighter of the Kurus, as also in<br>all places where he himself goes, and within his own palace, O tiger<br>among men! He should employ as spies men looking like idiots or like<br>those that are blind and deaf. Those should all be persons who have been<br>thoroughly examined (in respect of their ability), who are possessed of<br>wisdom, and who are able to endure hunger and thirst. With proper<br>attention, the king should set his spies upon all his counsellors and<br>friends and sons, in his city and the provinces, and in dominions of the<br>chiefs under him. His spies should be so employed that they may not know<br>one another. He should also, O bull of Bharata's race, know the spies of<br>his foes by himself setting spies in shops and places of amusement, and<br>concourses of people, among beggars, in his pleasure gardens and parks,<br>in meetings and conclaves of the learned, in the country, in public<br>places, in places where he holds his own court, and in the houses of the<br>citizens. The king possessed of intelligence may thus ascertain the spies<br>despatched by his foes. If these be known, the king may derive much<br>benefit, O son of Pandu! When the king, by a survey of his own, finds<br>himself weak, he should then, consulting with his counsellors make peace<br>with a foe that is stronger. The king that is wise should speedily make<br>peace with a foe, even when he knows that he is not weak, if any<br>advantage is to be derived from it. Engaged in protecting his kingdom<br>with righteousness, the king should make peace with those that are<br>possessed of every accomplishment, capable of great exertion, virtuous,<br>and honest. When the king finds himself threatened with danger and about<br>to be overtaken by ruin, he should slay all offenders whom he had<br>overlooked before and all such persons as are pointed at by the people. A<br>king should have nothing to do with that person who can neither benefit<br>nor injure him, or with one who cannot rescue himself from distress. As<br>regards military operations a king who is confident of his own strength,<br>should, at the head of a large force, cheerfully and with courage give<br>the order to march, without proclaiming his destination against one<br>destitute of allies and friends or already at war with another and<br>(therefore) heedless (of danger from other quarters), or one weaker than<br>himself, having first made arrangements for the protection of his own<br>capital.[217] A king should not for ever live in subjection to another<br>possessed of greater prowess. Though weak, he should seek to afflict the<br>stronger, and resolved upon this, continue to rule his own.[218] He<br>should afflict the kingdom of the stronger one by means of weapons, fire<br>and application of poison. He should also cause dissensions amongst his<br>counsellors and servants. Vrihaspati has said that a king possessed of<br>intelligence should always avoid war for acquisition of territory. The<br>acquisition of dominion should be made by the three well-known means (of<br>conciliation, gift, and disunion). The king that is possessed of wisdom<br>should be gratified with those acquisition that are made by means of<br>conciliation, gift, and disunion. The king, O delighter of the Kurus,<br>should take a sixth of the incomes of his subjects as tribute for meeting<br>the expenses of protecting them. He should also forcibly take away<br>wealth, much or little (as the case may require), from the ten kinds of<br>offenders mentioned in the scriptures, for the protection of his<br>subjects. A king should, without doubt, look upon his subjects as his own<br>children. In determining their disputes, however, he should not show<br>compassion. For hearing the complaints and answers of disputants in<br>judicial suits, the king should always appoint persons possessed of<br>wisdom and a knowledge of the affairs of the world, for the state really<br>rests upon a proper administration of justice. The king should set honest<br>and trustworthy men over his mines, salt, grain, ferries, and elephant<br>corps. The king who always wields with propriety the rod of chastisement<br>earns great merit. The proper regulation of chastisement is the high duty<br>of kings and deserves great applause. The king should be conversant with<br>the Vedas and their branches, possessed of wisdom, engaged in penances,<br>charitable, and devoted to the performance of sacrifices. All these<br>qualities should permanently reside in a king. If the king fails to<br>administer justice, he can neither have heaven nor fame. If a king be<br>afflicted by a stronger one, the former, if possessed of intelligence,<br>should seek refuge in a fort. Assembling his friends for consultation, he<br>should devise proper means. Adopting the policy of conciliation and of<br>producing dissensions, he should devise means for waging war with the<br>assailant. He should set the inhabitants of the woods on the high roads,<br>and, if necessary, cause whole villages to be removed, transplanting all<br>the inhabitants to minor towns or the outskirts of great cities.<br>Repeatedly assuring his wealthy subjects and the principal officers of<br>the army, he should cause the inhabitants of the open country to take<br>refuge in such forts as are well-protected. He should himself withdraw<br>all stores of grain (from the open country into his forts). If that<br>becomes impossible, he should destroy them completely by fire. He should<br>set men for destroying the crops on the fields of the enemy (by producing<br>disunion among the enemy's subjects). Failing to do this, he should<br>destroy those crops by means of his own troops. He should destroy all the<br>bridges over the rivers in his kingdom. He should bale out the waters of<br>all the tanks in his dominions, or, if incapable of baling them out,<br>cause them to be poisoned. Disregarding the duty of protecting his<br>friends, he should, in view of both present and future circumstances,<br>seek the protection of the ruler of another kingdom who may happen to be<br>the foe of his foe and who may be competent to deal with his foe on the<br>field of battle.[219] He should destroy all the smaller forts in his<br>kingdom. He should also cut down all the smaller trees excepting those<br>that are called Chaitya.[220] He should cause the branches of all the<br>larger trees to be lopped off, but he should not touch the very leaves of<br>those called Chaitya. He should raise outer ramparts round his forts,<br>with enclosures in them, and fill his trenches with water, driving<br>pointed stakes at their bottom and filling them with crocodiles and<br>sharks. He should keep small openings in his walls for making sallies<br>from his fort, and carefully make arrangements for their defence like<br>that of the greater gates.[221] In all his gates he should plant<br>destructive engines. He should plant on the ramparts (of his forts)<br>Sataghnis and other weapons. He should store wood for fuel and dig and<br>repair wells for supply of water to the garrison. He should cause all<br>houses made of grass and straw to be plastered over with mud, and if it<br>is the summer month, he should, from fear of fire, withdraw (into a place<br>of safety) all the stores of grass and straw. He should order all food to<br>be cooked at night. No fire should be ignited during the day, except for<br>the daily homa. Particular care should be taken of the fires in smithies<br>and lying-in rooms. Fires kept within the houses of the inhabitants<br>should be well covered. For the effectual protection of the city, it<br>should be proclaimed that condign punishment will overtake the person who<br>lights fires by the day time. During such times, all beggars, eunuchs,<br>lunatics, and mimes, should, O foremost of men, be driven out of the<br>town, for if they are permitted to remain, evil will follow. In places of<br>public resort, in tirthas, in assemblies, and in the houses of the<br>citizens, the king should set competent spies.[222] The king should cause<br>wide roads to be constructed and order shops, and places for the<br>distribution of water, to be opened at proper stations. Depots (of<br>diverse necessaries), arsenals, camps and quarters for soldiers, stations<br>for the keeping of horses and elephants, encampments of soldiers,<br>trenches, streets and bypaths, houses and gardens for retirement and<br>pleasure, should be so ordered that their sites may not be known to<br>others, O Yudhishthira. A king who is afflicted by a hostile army should<br>gather wealth, and store oil and fat and honey, and clarified butter, and<br>medicines of all kinds, and charcoal and munja grass, leaves, arrows,<br>scribes and draftsmen, grass, fuel, poisoned arrows, weapons of every<br>kind such as darts, swords, lances, and others. The king should store<br>such articles. He should especially keep ready drugs of every kind, roots<br>and fruits, the four kinds of physicians, actors and dancers, athletes,<br>and persons capable of assuming diverse disguises. He should decorate his<br>capital and gladden all his subjects. The king should lose no time in<br>bringing under his control such persons as may happen to inspire him with<br>fear, be they his servants or counsellors or citizens or neighbouring<br>monarchs. After any task of the king has been accomplished, he should<br>reward that those that have aided in its accomplishment with wealth and<br>other proportionate gifts and thankful speeches. It has been laid down in<br>the scriptures, O delighter of the Kurus, that a king pays off his debt<br>when he discomfits his foe or slays him outright.[223] A king should take<br>care of seven things. Listen to me as I recite them. They are his own<br>self, his counsellors, his treasury, his machinery for awarding<br>punishments, his friends, his provinces, and his capital. He should with<br>care protect his kingdom which consists of these seven limbs. That king,<br>O tiger among men, who is conversant with the aggregate of six, the<br>triple aggregate, and the high aggregate of three, succeeds in winning<br>the sovereignty of the whole earth. Listen, O Yudhishthira, to what has<br>been called the aggregate of six. These are ruling in peace after<br>concluding a treaty (with the foe), marching to battle, producing<br>disunion among the foe, concentration of forces, for inspiring the foe<br>with fear, preparedness for war with readiness for peace, and alliance<br>with others. Listen now with attention to what has been called the triple<br>aggregate. They are decrease, maintenance of what is, and growth. The<br>high aggregate of three consists of Virtue, Profit and Pleasure. These<br>should be pursued judiciously. By the aid of virtue, a king succeeds in<br>ruling the earth for ever. Touching this matter, Angirasa's son:<br>Vrihaspati himself has sung two verses. Blessed be thou, O son of Devaki,<br>it behoveth thee to hear them. 'Having discharged all his duties and<br>having protected the earth, and having also protected his cities, a king<br>attains to great happiness in heaven. What are penances to that king, and<br>what need has he of sacrifices who protects his people properly? Such a<br>king should be regarded as one conversant with every virtue!'<br><br>Yudhishthira said, 'There is the science of chastisement, there is the<br>king, and there are the subjects. Tell me, O grandsire, what advantage is<br>derived by one of these from the others.'<br><br>Bhishma said, 'Listen to me, O king, as I describe, O Bharata, the great<br>blessedness of the science of chastisement, in sacred words of grave<br>import. The science of chastisement forces all men to the observance of<br>the duties of their respective orders. Duly administered, it forces<br>people to virtuous acts.[224] When the four orders attend to their<br>respective duties, when all wholesome barriers are maintained, when peace<br>and happiness are made to flow from the science of chastisement, when the<br>people become freed from all fear, and the three higher orders endeavour,<br>according to their respective duties, to maintain harmony, know that men<br>become truly happy at such times. Whether it is the king that makes the<br>age, or, it is the age that makes the king, is a question about which<br>thou shouldst not entertain any doubt. The truth is that the king makes<br>the age. When, the king rules with a complete and strict reliance on the<br>science of chastisement, the foremost of ages called Krita is then said<br>to set in.[225] Righteousness sets in the Krita age. Nothing of<br>unrighteousness exists then. The hearts of men belonging to all the four<br>orders do not take any pleasure in unrighteousness. Without doubt, all<br>men succeed in acquiring the objects they desire and preserving those<br>that have been acquired. All the Vedic rites become productive of merit.<br>All the seasons become delightful and free from evil. The voice,<br>pronunciation, and minds of all men become clear and cheerful. Diseases<br>disappear and all men become long-lived. Wives do not become widows, and<br>no person becomes a miser. The earth yields crops without being tilled,<br>and herbs and plants grow in luxuriance. Barks, leaves, fruits, and<br>roots, become vigorous and abundant. No unrighteousness is seen. Nothing<br>but righteousness exists. Know these to be the characteristics, O<br>Yudhishthira, of the Krita age. When the king relies upon only three of<br>the four parts of the science of chastisement leaving out a fourth, the<br>age called Treta sets in. A fourth part of unrighteousness follows in the<br>train of such observance (of the great science) by three-fourths. The<br>earth yields crops but waits for tillage. The herbs and plants grow<br>(depending upon tillage). When the king observes the great science by<br>only a half, leaving out the other half, then the age that sets in is<br>called Dwapara. A moiety of unrighteousness follows in the train of such<br>observance of the great science by half. The earth requires tillage and<br>yields crops by half. When the king, abandoning the great science<br>totally, oppresses his subjects by evil means of diverse kinds, the age<br>that sets in is called Kali. During the age called Kali, unrighteousness<br>becomes full and nothing of righteousness is seen. The hearts of men, of<br>all the orders, fall away from their respective duties. Sudras live by<br>adopting lives of mendicancy, and Brahmanas live by serving others. Men<br>fail to acquire the objects they desire and preserve those already<br>acquired. Intermixture of the four orders takes place. Vedic rites fail<br>to produce fruits. All the seasons cease to be delightful and become<br>fraught with evil. The voice, pronunciation, and minds of men lose<br>vigour. Diseases appear, and men die prematurely. Wives become widows,<br>and many cruel men are seen. The clouds do not pour seasonably, and crops<br>fail. All kinds of moisture also fail, when the king does not, with<br>proper attention to the great science, protect the subjects. The king is<br>the creator of the Krita age, of the Treta, and of the Dwapara. The king<br>is the cause of the fourth age (called Kali). If he causes the Krita age,<br>he attains to everlasting heaven. If he causes the Treta age, he acquires<br>heaven for a period that is limited. If he causes the Dwapara, he attains<br>to blessedness in heaven according to the measure of his merits. By<br>causing the Kali age, the king incurs a heavy load of sin. Stained by<br>wickedness, he rots in hell for innumerable years, for sinking in the<br>sins of his subjects, he incurs great sin and infamy himself. Keeping the<br>great science in his view, the Kshatriya possessed of learning should<br>strive to acquire those objects which he desires and protect those that<br>have been already acquired. The science of chastisement, which<br>establishes all men in the observance of their respective duties, which<br>is the groundwork of all wholesome distinctions, and which truly upholds<br>the world and sets it agoing, if properly administered, protects all men<br>like the mother and the father protecting their children. Know, O bull<br>among men, that the very lives of creatures depend upon it. The highest<br>merit a king can acquire is acquaintance with the science of chastisement<br>and administering it properly. Therefore, O thou of Kuru's race, protect<br>thy subjects righteously, with the aid of that great science. By<br>protecting the subjects and adopting such a conduct, thou wilt surely<br>attain to such blessedness in heaven as is difficult of acquisition."
