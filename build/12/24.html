                            Vaisampayana said, "Once more the great sage Krishna-Dwaipayana said<br>these words unto Ajatasatru, the son of Kunti: 'Let these great<br>car-warriors of abundant energy of mind, O monarch, let these brothers of<br>thine, O Yudhishthira, the chief of the Bharatas, obtain those wishes of<br>theirs that they cherished while dwelling in the woods. Rule thou the<br>earth, O son of Pritha, like (another) Yayati, the son of Nahusha. Before<br>now misery was yours while ye dwelt in the woods in the observance of<br>ascetic penances. That misery is ended, O tiger among men! Enjoy<br>happiness, therefore, for some time. Having O Bharata, earned and enjoyed<br>religious merit and wealth and pleasure for some time with thy brothers,<br>thou mayst then, O king, retire into the woods. Be freed first, O<br>Bharata, from the debt thou owest to persons that may beg of thee, to the<br>Pitris, and to the gods. Thou mayst then, O son of Kunti, practise all<br>the other modes of life (that come afterwards). Do thou, O son of Kuru's<br>race, perform the sacrifices of Sarvamedha and Aswamedha. Thou shalt then<br>attain, O monarch, to the highest end hereafter. Installing thy brothers<br>also in great sacrifices with plentiful presents (to the Brahmanas), thou<br>shalt, O son of Pandu, acquire great fame. There is a saying, O tiger<br>among men and best of the Kurus! Listen to it, for by acting according to<br>it, O king, thou shalt not swerve from virtue. Those men only, O<br>Yudhishthira, whose practices resemble those of robbers, cause a king by<br>their counsels to take to a career of war and victory.[70] That king who,<br>guided by considerations of place and time and moved by an understanding<br>dependent on the scriptures, pardons even a number of robbers, incurs no<br>sin. That king who, realising his tribute of a sixth, doth not protect<br>his kingdom, taketh a fourth part of the sins of his kingdom.[71] Listen<br>also to that by which a king may not swerve from virtue. By transgressing<br>the scriptures (one incurs sill), while by obeying them one may live<br>fearlessly. That king who, guided by an understanding based upon the<br>scriptures and disregarding lust and wrath, behaves impartially, like a<br>father, towards all his subjects, never incurs sin. O thou of great<br>splendour, if a king, afflicted by destiny, fails to accomplish an act<br>which he should, such failure would not be called a trespass. By force<br>and policy should the king put down his foes. He must not suffer sin to<br>be perpetrated in his kingdom but should cause virtue to be practised.<br>Brave men, those that are respectable in their practices, they that are<br>virtuous in their acts, they that are possessed of learning, O<br>Yudhishthira, Brahmanas conversant with Vedic texts and rites, and men of<br>wealth, should especially be protected. In determining suits and<br>accomplishing religious acts, they that are possessed of great learning<br>should alone be employed. A prudent king will never repose his confidence<br>upon one individual, however accomplished. That king who does not protect<br>his subjects, whose passions are ungovernable, who is full of vanity, who<br>is stained with haughtiness and malice, incurs sin and earns the reproach<br>of tyranny. If the subjects of a king, O monarch, waste away from want of<br>protection and are afflicted by the gods and ground down by robbers, the<br>sin of all this stains the king himself. There is no sin, O Yudhishthira,<br>in doing an act with heartiness, after full deliberation, and<br>consultation with men capable of offering good advice. Our tasks fail or<br>succeed through destiny. If exertion, however, be applied, sin would not<br>touch the king. I shall recite to thee, O tiger among kings, the story of<br>what happened to an ancient king of the name of Hayagriva, O son of<br>Pandu,&#8212;the story, viz., of the heroic Hayagriva of unstained deeds, who<br>after having slain a large number of his foes in battle, was himself<br>defeated and slain while without a follower by his side. Having achieved<br>all that should be done for keeping foes under check and adopted all<br>those foremost of means by which men may be protected. Hayagriva acquired<br>great fame from the battles he fought and is now enjoying great bliss in<br>heaven. Mangled by robbers with weapons, boldly fighting with them, and<br>casting off his life in battle, the high-souled Hayagriva, ever attentive<br>to his (kingly) duties, achieved the object of his life and is now<br>enjoying great bliss in heaven. The bow was his (sacrificial) stake and<br>the bowstring was the cord for tying the victims. Shafts constituted the<br>smaller ladle and the sword the large one, and blood was the clarified<br>butter that he poured. The car was the altar and the wrath he felt in<br>battle was the fire, and the four foremost of steeds yoked unto his<br>vehicle were the four Hotris. Having poured upon that sacrificial fire<br>his foes as libations and then his own life-breaths at the completion of<br>the sacrifice, that vigorous lion among kings, viz., Hayagriva, became<br>freed from sin and is now sporting in the regions of the gods. Having<br>protected his kingdom with policy and intelligence, the high-souled<br>Hayagriva of resigned self and great strength of mind and accustomed to<br>the performance of sacrifices filled all the worlds with his fame and is<br>now sporting in the region of the gods.[72] Having obtained the merit<br>dependent on the performance of sacrifices as also every kind of merit<br>that is connected with human affairs, he wielded the rod of chastisement<br>and ruled the Earth with vigour and without pride. For this the virtuous<br>and high-souled Hayagriva is sporting in the region of the gods.[73]<br>Possessed of learning, practising renunciation, actuated by faith, and<br>full of gratitude, that king, having performed diverse acts, left this<br>world of men and won the regions that are reserved for the intelligent<br>and the wise and those that are of approved usages and behaviour and<br>prepared to cast off their lives in battle. Having studied the Vedas well<br>and the other scriptures also, having ruled his kingdom properly and<br>caused all the four orders to adhere to their respective duties, the<br>high-souled Hayagriva is sporting in joy the regions of the gods. Having<br>won many battles and cherished his subjects, having drunk the Soma juice<br>in sacrifices and gratified the foremost of Brahmanas with presents and<br>judiciously wielded the rod of chastisement over those placed under his<br>sway and at last cast off his life in battle, that king is living happily<br>in heaven. His life was worthy of every praise. Learned and honest men<br>applaud it, deserving as it is of every applause. Having won heaven and<br>acquired the regions reserved for heroes, that high-souled monarch of<br>virtuous deeds became crowned with success.'
