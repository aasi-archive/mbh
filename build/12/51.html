                            "Vaisampayana said, 'King Yudhishthira, hearing of those feats of Rama,<br>became filled with wonder and said unto Janardana, O thou of Vrishni's<br>race, the prowess of the high-souled Rama, who in wrath had freed the<br>earth of Kshatriyas, was like that of Sakra himself. The scions of<br>Kshatriyas, troubled with the fear of Rama, were concealed (and brought<br>up) by kine, Ocean, leopards, bears and apes. Worthy of every praise is<br>this world of men and fortunate are they that reside in it where a feat,<br>that, was again so righteous, was accomplished by a. Brahmana.' After<br>this discourse was ended, those two illustrious persons, viz., Krishna of<br>unfading glory and Yudhishthira proceeded thither where the puissant son<br>of Ganga lay on his bed of arrows. They then beheld Bhishma stretched on<br>his arrowy bed and resembling in splendour the evening San covered with<br>his own rays. The Kuru hero was surrounded by many ascetics like he of a<br>hundred sacrifices by the deities of heaven. The spot on which he lay was<br>highly sacred, being situate on the banks of the river Oghavati.<br>Beholding him from a distance, Krishna and Dharma's royal son, and the<br>four Pandavas, and the other headed by Saradwat, alighted from their<br>vehicles and collecting their restless minds and concentrating all their<br>senses, approached the great Rishis. Saluting those foremost of Rishis<br>headed by Vyasa. Govinda and Satyaki and the others approached the son of<br>Ganga. Beholding Ganga's son of great ascetic merit, the Yadu and Kuru<br>princes, those foremost of men, took their seats, surrounding him. Seeing<br>Bhishma looking like a fire about to die out, Kesava with a rather<br>cheerless heart addressed him as follows.'<br><br>"Kesava said, 'Are thy perceptions now as clear as before? I hope thy<br>understanding, O foremost of eloquent men, is not clouded. I hope thy<br>limbs are not tortured by the pain arising from the wounds by shafts.<br>From mental grief also the body becomes weak. In consequences of the boon<br>granted to thee by thy sire, the righteous Santanu, thy death, O puissant<br>hero, depends on thy own will. I myself have not that merit in<br>consequence of which thou hast obtained this boon. The minutest pin<br>(inserted) within the body produces pain. What need then be said, O king,<br>of hundreds of arrows that have pierced thee? Surely, pain cannot be said<br>to afflict thee. Thou art competent, O Bharata, to instruct the very gods<br>regarding the origin and dissolution of living creatures. Possessed of<br>great knowledge, everything belonging to the Past, the Future, and the<br>Present, is well known to thee. The dissolution of created beings and the<br>reward of righteousness are well known to thee, O thou of great wisdom,<br>for thou art an ocean of virtue and duty. While living in the enjoyment<br>of swelling sovereignty, I beheld thee forgo female intercourse though<br>sound of limbs and perfectly hale and though surrounded by female<br>companions. Except Santanu's son Bhishma of great energy and firmly<br>devoted to righteousness, possessed of heroism and having virtue for the<br>only object of his pursuit, we have never heard of any other person in<br>the three worlds that could, by his ascetic power, though lying on a bed<br>of arrows and at the point of death, still have such a complete mastery<br>over death (as to keep it thus at bay). We have never heard of anybody<br>else that was so devoted to truth, to penances, to gifts, to the<br>performances of sacrifices, to the science of arms, to the Vedas, and to<br>the protection of persons soliciting protection, and that was so harmless<br>to all creatures, so pure in behaviour, so self-restrained, and so bent<br>upon the good of all creatures, and that was also so great a car-warrior<br>as thee. Without doubt, thou art competent to subjugate, on a single car,<br>the gods, Gandharvas, Asuras, Yakshas, and Rakshasas. O mighty-armed<br>Bhishma, thou art always spoken of by the Brahmanas as the ninth of the<br>Vasus. By thy virtues, however, thou hast surpassed them all and art<br>equal unto Vasava himself. I know, O best of persons, that thou art<br>celebrated for thy prowess, O foremost of beings, among even the very<br>gods. Among men on earth, O foremost of men, we have never seen nor heard<br>of any one possessed of such attributes as thee. O thou of the royal<br>order, thou surpassest the gods themselves in respect of every attribute.<br>By thy ascetic power thou canst create a universe of mobile and immobile<br>creatures. What need then be said of thy having acquired many blessed<br>regions by means of thy foremost of virtues? Dispel now the grief of the<br>eldest son of Panda who is burning with sorrow on account of the<br>slaughter of his kinsmen. All the duties that have been declared in<br>respect of the four orders about the four modes of life are well known to<br>thee. Everything again that is indicated in the four branches of<br>knowledge, in the four Hotras, O Bharata, as also those eternal duties<br>that are laid down in Yoga and Sankhya philosophy, the duties too of the<br>four orders and these duties that are not inconsistent with their<br>declared practices,&#8212;all these, along with their interpretations, O son<br>of Ganga, are known to thee. The duties that have been laid down for<br>those sprang from an intermixture of the four orders and those laid down<br>for particular countries and tribes and families, and those declared by<br>the Vedas and by men of wisdom, are all well known to thee. The subjects<br>of histories and the Puranas are all known to thee. All the scriptures<br>treating of duty and practice dwell in thy mind. Save thee, O bull among<br>men, there is no other person that can remove the doubts that may arise<br>in respect of those subjects of knowledge that are studied in the world.<br>With the aid of thy intelligence, do thou, O prince of men, drive the<br>sorrow felt by the son of Pandu. Persons possessed of so great and such<br>varied knowledge live only for comforting men whose minds have been<br>stupefied.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing those words of Vasudeva of great<br>intelligence, Bhishma, raising his head a little, said these words with<br>joined hands.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Salutations to thee, O divine Krishna! Thou art the<br>origin and thou art the dissolution of all the worlds. Thou art the<br>Creator and thou art the Destroyer. Thou, O Hrishikesa, art incapable of<br>being vanquished by any one. The universe is the handiwork. Thou art the<br>soul of the universe and the universe hath sprung from thee. Salutations<br>to thee! Thou art the end of all created things. Thou art above the five<br>elements. Salutations to thee that art the three worlds and that art<br>again above the three worlds. O lord of Yogins, salutations to thee that<br>art the refuge of everything. O foremost of beings, those words which<br>thou hast said regarding me have enabled me to behold thy divine<br>attributes as manifest in the three worlds. (In consequence of that<br>kindness), O Govinda, I also behold thy eternal form. Thou standest<br>shutting up the seven paths of the Wind possessed of immeasurable energy.<br>The firmament is occupied by thy head, and the earth by thy feet. The<br>points of the compass are thy two arms, and the Sun is thy eye, and Sakra<br>constitutes thy prowess. O thou of unfading glory, thy Person, attired in<br>yellow robes that resemble the hue of the Atasi flower, seem to us to be<br>like a cloud charged with flashing of lightning. Think of that, O best of<br>gods, which would be good, O thou of lotus eyes, for my humble self, that<br>am devoted to thee, that seek thy protection, and that am desirous of<br>obtaining a blissful end.'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'Since, O bull among men, thy devotion to me is very<br>great, for this, O prince, I have displayed my celestial form to thee. I<br>do not, O foremost of kings, display myself unto one that is not devoted<br>to me, or unto a devotee that is not sincere, or unto one, O Bharata,<br>that is not of restrained soul. Thou art devoted to me and art always<br>observant of righteousness. Of a pure heart, thou art always<br>self-restrained and ever observant of penances and gifts. Through thy own<br>penances, O Bhishma, thou art competent to behold me. Those regions, O<br>king, are ready for thee whence there is no return.[156] Six and fifty<br>days, O foremost one of Kuru's race, still remain for thee to live!<br>Casting off thy body, thou shalt then, O Bhishma, obtain the blessed<br>reward of thy acts. Behold, those deities and the Vasus, all endued with<br>forms of fiery splendour, riding on their cars, are waiting for thee<br>invisibly till the moment of the sun's entering on northerly course.<br>Subject to universal time, when the divine Surya turns to his northerly<br>course, thou, O foremost of men, shalt go to those regions whence no man<br>of knowledge ever returns to this earth! When thou, O Bhishma, wilt leave<br>this world for that, all Knowledge, O hero, will expire with thee. It is<br>for this, that all these persons, assembled together, have approached<br>thee for listening to discourses on duty and morality. Do thou then speak<br>words of truth, fraught with morality and Yoga, unto Yudhishthira who as<br>firm in truth but whose learning has been clouded by grief on account of<br>the slaughter of his kinsmen, and do thou, by this, quickly dispel that<br>grief of his!'
