                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, if gifts, sacrifices,<br>penances, and dutiful services returned to preceptors, are productive of<br>wisdom and high felicity.'[543]<br><br>'Bhishma said, 'If the mind becomes affected by desire, wrath and other<br>evil passions, it then runs towards sin. If one's acts are stained by<br>sin, one is obliged to dwell in painful regions. Sinful men take birth in<br>indigent circumstances and repeatedly suffer the pangs of famine, woe,<br>fear, and death. Those that are virtuous in their acts, and possessed of<br>faith, and that have their senses under control, become born as affluent<br>men and repeatedly sport in festivities and heaven and happiness.<br>Unbelievers, with their arms manacled, are sent to regions rendered<br>inaccessible by carnivorous beasts and elephants and full of terrors in<br>consequence of snakes and robbers. What more need be said of them? They,<br>on the other hand, who have reverence for gods and guests, who are<br>liberal, who are fond of good and honest men, go, in consequence of their<br>acts of charity, along that happy way which belongs to persons of<br>cleansed souls. They that have no reverence for virtue are as vile among<br>men as seedless grains among corn or the gnat among birds. That which is<br>ordained in consequence of the acts of a past life pursues the actor even<br>if the latter strives his best for leaving it behind.[544] It sleeps when<br>he sleeps and does whatever else he does.[545] Like his shadow it rests<br>when he rests, proceeds when he proceeds, and acts when he acts. Whatever<br>acts a man does he has certainly to obtain the fruits thereof. Death is<br>dragging all creatures who are surely destined to fall (into orders of<br>existence they deserve) and who are surely 'liable to enjoy or suffer<br>that which has been ordained as the consequence of their acts. The acts<br>of a past life develop their consequences in their own proper time even<br>as flowers and fruits, without extraneous efforts of any kind, never fail<br>to appear when their proper time comes. After the consequences, as<br>ordained, of the acts of a past life, have been exhausted (by enjoyment<br>or sufferings), honour and disgrace, gain and loss, decay and growth, no<br>longer flow or appear in respect of any one. This happens<br>repeatedly.[546] A creature while still in the mother's womb enjoys or<br>suffers the happiness or the misery that has been ordained for him in<br>consequence of his own acts. In childhood or youth or old age, at<br>whatever period of life one does an act good or bad, the consequences<br>thereof are sure to visit him in his next life at precisely the same<br>period. As a calf recognises and approaches its parent in the midst of<br>even a thousand kine, even so the acts of a past life recognise and visit<br>the doer in his new life. Washed in water a (dirty) piece of cloth<br>becomes clean. Similarly, men burning in repentance obtain endless<br>happiness by proper penances.[547] Those that can take up their residence<br>in the woods and by performing austerities for a long period can wash<br>themselves of their sins, succeed in obtaining the objects on which they<br>set their hearts. As no one can mark the track of birds in the sky or of<br>fishes in the water, similarly, the track of persons whose souls have<br>been cleansed by knowledge cannot be marked by any.[548] There is no need<br>of any more eloquence or any more reference to sinful acts. Suffice it to<br>say that one should, with proper judgment and as befits one best, do what<br>is for one's good. This is the means by which wisdom and high felicity<br>may be achieved.'"
