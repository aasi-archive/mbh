                            "Bhrigu said, 'Forest recluses seeking the acquisition of virtue go to<br>sacred waters and rivers and springs, and undergo penances in lone and<br>secluded woods abounding with deer and buffaloes and boars and tigers and<br>wild elephants. They forsake all kinds of robes and food and enjoyments<br>for which people living in society have a taste. They subsist<br>abstemiously upon wild herbs and fruits and roots and leaves of diverse<br>kinds. The bare ground is their seat. They lie down on the bare earth or<br>rocks or pebbles or gravel or sand or ashes. They cover their limbs with<br>grass and animal skins and barks of trees. They never shave their heads<br>and beards or pare their nails. They perform their ablutions at regular<br>intervals. They pour libations on the ground, as also on the sacred fire<br>at the proper time without fail. They never enjoy any rest till<br>completion of their daily gathering of the sacred fuel (for their homa<br>fires) and sacred grass and flowers (for sacrifice and worship) and till<br>they have swept and rubbed clean (their sacrificial altars). They bear<br>without the least regard cold and heat, and rain and wind, and,<br>therefore, the skin of their bodies is cracked all over; and in<br>consequence of observing and laying down for themselves various kinds of<br>rites and vows and acts, their flesh and blood and skin and bones become<br>emaciated.[580] Endued with great patience and fortitude, they live,<br>always practising the quality of goodness. That person who, with<br>restrained soul, observes such a course of duties originally ordained by<br>regenerate Rishis, burns all his sins like fire and obtains regions of<br>felicity difficult of attainment.'<br><br>"I shall now describe the conduct of those called Parivrajakas. That is<br>as follows: freeing themselves from attachment to the sacred fire,<br>wealth, spouse and children, and robes, seats, beds, and such other<br>objects of enjoyment, and breaking the bonds of affection, they roam<br>about, regarding with an equal eye a clump of earth or rock and gold.<br>They never set their hearts on the acquisition or enjoyment of the triple<br>aggregate. They cast an equal eye on foes and friends and neutrals or<br>strangers. They never injure, in thought, word, or deed, immobile things<br>or creatures that are viviparous, or oviparous or born of filth, or<br>called vegetables. They have no homes. They roam over hills and<br>mountains, upon shores of rivers or seas, under shades of trees, and<br>among temples of deities. They may go to towns or villages for residence.<br>In a town, however, they should not live for more than five nights, while<br>in a village their residence should never exceed one night. Entering a<br>town or a village, they should, for the support of life, repair to the<br>abodes of only Brahmanas of liberal deeds.[581] They should never ask for<br>any alms except what is thrown into the (wooden) bowls they carry. They<br>should free themselves from lust, wrath, pride, cupidity, delusion,<br>miserliness, deceit, slander, vanity, and injury to living creatures. On<br>this subject there are some verses: that person, who, observing the vow<br>of taciturnity, roveth without giving any creature cause of fear, is<br>never inspired with any fear himself by any creature. That learned person<br>who performs the Agnihotra (not by kindling of, external fire but) with<br>the aid of the fire that is his own body, indeed, who poureth libations<br>into his own mouth and upon the fire that exists in his own body,<br>succeeds in attaining to numerous regions of felicity in consequence of<br>that fire being fed with such libations obtained by a life of<br>eleemosynation. That person of regenerate birth who observes in the<br>aforesaid way this mode of life having Emancipation for its end, with a<br>pure heart and with an understanding freed from resolution, attains to<br>Brahma after the manner of a tranquil ray of light that is not fed by any<br>blazing fuel.'<br><br>"Bharadwaja said, 'Beyond this region (that we inhabit) there is a region<br>that we have heard of but never seen. I desire to know all about it. It<br>behoveth thee to describe it to me.'<br><br>"Bhrigu said, 'Towards the north, on the other side of Himavat, which is<br>sacred and possessed of every merit, there is a region that is sacred,<br>blessed, and highly desirable. That is called the other world.[582] The<br>men that inhabit that region are righteous in act, pious, of pure hearts,<br>freed from cupidity and errors of judgment, and not subject to<br>afflictions of any kind. That region is, indeed, equal to heaven,<br>possessed as it is of such excellent attributes. Death comes there at the<br>proper season. Diseases never touch the inhabitants.[583] Nobody<br>cherishes any desire for the wives of other people. Every one is devoted<br>to his own wife. These people do not afflict or kill one another, or<br>covet one another's things. There no sin occurs, no doubt arises.[584]<br>There the fruits of all (religious) acts are visible. There some enjoy<br>seats and drinks and viands of the best kind, and live within palaces and<br>mansions. There some, adorned with ornaments of gold, surround themselves<br>with every article of enjoyment. There are, again, some that eat very<br>abstemiously, for only keeping body and soul together. There some, with<br>great toil, seek to hold the life-breaths.[585] Here (in this region that<br>is inhabited by us), some men are devoted to righteousness and some to<br>deceit. Some are happy and some miserable; some are poor and some rich.<br>Here toil, and fear and delusion, and painful hunger make their<br>appearance. Here cupidity for wealth is also seen, a passion that<br>stupefies even those that are learned amongst men. Here diverse opinions<br>prevail, broached by those that do deeds which are righteous or sinful.<br>That man possessed of wisdom who knows all those opinions which may be<br>divided into two kinds, is never stained by sin. Deceit With fraud,<br>theft, slander, malice, oppression, injury, treachery, and untruth, and<br>vices that detract from the merit of his penances who practises them. He,<br>on the other hand, possessed of learning, who avoids them, finds the<br>merit of his penances increased. Here there is much reflection about acts<br>that are righteous and those that are unrighteous. This region that we<br>inhabit is the field of action. Having done good and evil here, one<br>obtains good for his good acts and evil for acts that are evil.[586] Here<br>the very Creator in days of yore, and all the gods with the Rishis,<br>having performed proper penances, become cleansed and attain to<br>Brahma.[587] The northern portion of the earth is highly auspicious and<br>sacred. Those belonging to this region (that we inhabit) that are doers<br>of righteous deeds or that show regard for yoga, become born in that<br>region. Others (that are of a different disposition) take their births in<br>the intermediate species. Some again, when their allotted periods run<br>out, become lost on earth.[588] Employed in feeding upon one another and<br>stained by cupidity and delusion, these mea return to this very region<br>without being able to go (after death) to that northern region. Those men<br>of wisdom who with vows and observant of Brahmacharyya listen with<br>veneration to the instructions of preceptors, succeed in knowing the ends<br>reserved for all classes of men. I have now told thee in brief the course<br>of duties ordained by Brahman. He, indeed, is said to be possessed of<br>intelligence who knows what is righteousness and what its reverse in this<br>world.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus, O king, did Bhrigu speak unto Bharadwaja of<br>great energy. Of soul highly virtuous, the latter became filled with<br>wonder and worshipped the great sage with veneration. Thus, O monarch,<br>the origin of the universe has been narrated to thee in detail. What, O<br>thou of great wisdom, dost thou wish to hear after this?"'
