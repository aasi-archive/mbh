                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having said these words, the celestial Rishi Narada<br>became silent. The royal sage Yudhishthira, filled with grief, became<br>plunged in meditation. Beholding that hero cheerless and unmanned by<br>sorrow, sighing like a snake and shedding copious tears, Kunti, herself<br>filled with grief and almost deprived of her senses by sorrow, addressed<br>him in these sweet words of grave import and well-suited to the occasion,<br>'O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, it behoveth thee not to give way to sorrow<br>thus. O thou of great wisdom, kill this grief of thine, and listen to<br>what I say. I tried in past times to apprise Karna of his brothership<br>with thee. The god Surya also, O foremost of all righteous persons, did<br>the same. All that a well-wishing friend, from desire of good, should say<br>unto one, was said unto Karna by that god in a dream and once more in my<br>presence. Neither by affliction nor by reasons could Surya or myself<br>succeed in pacifying him or inducing him to unite himself with thee.<br>Succumbing to the influence of Time, he became resolved upon wreaking his<br>enmity on thee. As he was bent upon doing injuries upon you all, I myself<br>gave up the attempt.' Thus addressed by his mother, king Yudhishthira,<br>with tearful eyes and heart agitated by grief, said these words, 'In<br>consequence of thyself having concealed thy counsels, this great<br>affliction has overtaken me!' Possessed of great energy, the righteous<br>king, then, in sorrow, cursed all the women of the world, saying,<br>'Henceforth no woman shall succeed in keeping a secret.' The king, then,<br>recollecting his sons and grandsons and kinsmen and friends, became<br>filled with anxiety and grief. Afflicted with sorrow, the intelligent<br>king, resembling a fire covered with smoke, became overwhelmed with<br>despair."
