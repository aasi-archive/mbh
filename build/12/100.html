                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, how kings desirous of victory<br>should, O bull of Bharata's race, lead their troops to battle even by<br>offending slightly against the rules of righteousness!'<br><br>"Bhishma said: 'Some say that righteousness is made stable by truth;<br>some, by reasoning: so me, by good behaviour; and some, by the<br>application of means and contrivances.[294] I shall presently tell thee<br>what the means and contrivances, productive of immediate fruit, are.<br>Robbers, transgressing all wholesome bounds, very often become destroyers<br>of property and religious merit. For resisting and restraining them. I<br>shall tell thee what the contrivances are, as indicated in the<br>scriptures. Listen to me as I speak of those means for the success of all<br>acts. Both kinds of wisdom, straight and crooked, should be within call<br>of the king. Though acquainted with it, he should not, however, apply<br>that wisdom which is crooked (for injuring others). He may use it for<br>resisting the dangers that may overtake him. Enemies frequently injure a<br>king by producing disunion (among his ministers or troops or allies or<br>subjects). The king, conversant with deceit, may, by the aid of deceit,<br>counteract those enemies. Leathern armour for protecting the bodies of<br>elephants, armour of the same material for bovine bulls, bones, thorns,<br>and keen-pointed weapons made of iron, coats of mail, yak-tails, sharp<br>and well-tempered weapons, all kinds of armour, yellow and red, banners<br>and standards of diverse hues, swords, and lances and scimitars of great<br>sharpness and battle-axes, and spears and shields, should be manufactured<br>and stored in abundance. The weapons should all be properly whetted. The<br>soldiers should be inspired with courage and resolution. It is proper to<br>set the troops in motion in the month of Chaitra or Agrahayana. The crops<br>ripen about that time and water also does not become scarce. That time of<br>the year, O Bharata, is neither very cold nor very hot. Troops should,<br>therefore, be moved at that time. If the enemy, however, be overtaken by<br>distress, troops should immediately be set in motion (without waiting for<br>such a favourable time). These (two) are the best occasions for the<br>motion of troops with a view to subjugate foes. That road which has<br>abundance of water and grass along it, which is level and easy of march,<br>should be adopted (in moving the troops). The regions lying near the road<br>(on both its sides) should previously be well ascertained through spies<br>possessed of skill and having an intimate knowledge of the woods. The<br>troops must not, like animals, be marched through woody regions. Kings<br>desirous of victory should, therefore, adopt good roads for marching<br>their troops. In the van should be placed a division of brave men, endued<br>with strength and high birth. As regards forts, that which has walls and<br>a trench full of water on every side and only one entrance, is worthy of<br>praise. In respect of invading foes, resistance may be offered from<br>within it. In pitching the camp, a region lying near the woods is<br>regarded as much better than one under the open sky by men conversant<br>with war and possessed of military accomplishments. The camp should be<br>pitched for the troops not far from such a wood. Pitching the camp at<br>such a place, planting the foot-soldiers in a position of safety, and<br>collision with the foe as soon as he comes, are the means for warding off<br>danger and distress. Keeping the constellation called Ursa Major[295]<br>behind them, the troops should fight taking up their stand like hills. By<br>this means, one may vanquish even foes that are irresistible. The troops<br>should be placed in such a position that the wind, the sun, and the<br>planet Sukra[296] should blow and shine from behind them. As means for<br>ensuing victory the wind is superior to the Sun, and the Sun is superior<br>to Sukra, O Yudhishthira. Men conversant with war approve of a region<br>that is not miry, not watery, not uneven, and not abounding with bricks<br>and stone, as well-fitted for the operations of cavalry. A field that is<br>free from mire and holes is fitted for car-warriors. A region that is<br>overgrown with bushes and large trees and that is under water is fitted<br>for elephant-warriors. A region that has many inaccessible spots, that is<br>overgrown with large trees and topes of cane bushes, as also a<br>mountainous or woody tract, is well-fitted for the operations of<br>infantry. An army, O Bharata, which has a large infantry force, is<br>regarded very strong. An army in which cars and horsemen predominate is<br>regarded to be very effective in a clear (unrainy) day. An army, again;<br>in which footsoldiers and elephants predominate becomes effective in the<br>rainy season. Having attended to these points (about the characters of<br>the different kinds of forces and the manner of marching, quartering, and<br>leading them), the king should turn his attention to the characteristics<br>of place and time. That king, who having attended to all these<br>considerations, sets out under a proper constellation and on an<br>auspicious lunation, always succeeds in obtaining victory by properly<br>leading his troops. No one should slay those that are asleep or thirsty<br>or fatigued, or those whose accoutrements have fallen away, or one that<br>has set his heart on final emancipation,[297] or one that is flying away,<br>or one that is walking (unprepared) along a road, or one engaged in<br>drinking or eating, or one that is mad, or one that is insane, or one<br>that has been wounded mortally, or one that has been exceedingly weakened<br>by his wounds, or one that is staying trustfully, or one that has begun<br>any task without having been able to complete it,[298] or one that is<br>skilled in some especial art (as mining, etc.), or one that is in grief,<br>or one that goes out of the camp for procuring forage or fodder, or men<br>who set up camps or are camp-followers, or those that wait at the gates<br>of the king or of his ministers, or those that do menial services (unto<br>the chiefs of the army), or those that are chiefs of such servants. Those<br>amongst thy warriors that break the rank of foes, or rally thy retreating<br>troops, should have their pay doubled and should be honoured by thee with<br>food, drink, and seats equal to thy own. Those amongst such that are<br>chiefs of ten soldiers should be made chiefs of a hundred. That heedful<br>hero again (amongst them) who is the chief of a hundred soldiers should<br>be made the chief of a thousand. Collecting together the principal<br>warriors, they should be addressed, thus: 'Let us swear to conquer, and<br>never to desert one another. Let those that are inspired with fear stay<br>here. Let those also stay here that would cause their chiefs to be slain<br>by themselves neglecting to act heroically in the press of battle. Let<br>such men come as would never break away from battle or cause their own<br>comrades to be slain. Protecting their own selves as also their comrades,<br>they are certain to slay the enemy in fight. The consequence of flying<br>away from battle are loss of wealth, death, infamy, and reproach.<br>Disagreeable and cutting speeches have to be heard by that man who flies<br>away from battle, who loses his lips and teeth,[299] who throws away all<br>his weapons, or who suffers himself to be taken as a captive by the foe.<br>Let such evil consequences always overtake the warriors of our foes.<br>Those that fly away from battle are wretches among men. They simply swell<br>the tale of human beings on earth. For true manhood, however, they are<br>neither here nor hereafter. Victorious foes, O sire, proceed cheerfully.<br>Their praises recited the while by bards, in pursuit of the flying<br>combatants. When enemies, coming to battle tarnish the fame of a person,<br>the misery the latter feels is more poignant, I think, than that of death<br>itself. Know that victory is the root of religious merit and of every<br>kind of happiness. That which is regarded as the highest misery by<br>cowards is cheerfully borne by those that are heroes.[300] Resolved upon<br>acquiring heaven, we should fight, regardless of life itself, and<br>determined to conquer or die, attain a blessed end in heaven. Having<br>taken such an oath, and prepared to throwaway life itself, heroes should<br>courageously rush against the enemy's ranks. In the van should be placed<br>a division of men armed with swords and shields. In the rear should be<br>placed the car-division. In the space intervening should be placed other<br>classes of combatants. This should be the arrangement made for assailing<br>the foe. Those combatants in the army that are veterans should fight in<br>the van. They would protect their comrades behind them. Those amongst the<br>army that would be regarded as foremost for strength and courage, should<br>be placed in the van. The others should stand behind them. They that are<br>inspired with fear should, with care, be comforted and encouraged. These<br>weaker combatants should be placed on the field (without being withdrawn)<br>for at least showing the number of the army (to the foe).[301] If the<br>troops are few, they should be drawn close together for the fight. At<br>times, if their leader wishes, the close array may be extended wide. When<br>a small number of troops is to fight with a great army, the array called<br>Suchimukha should be formed.[302] When a small force is engaged with a<br>large one, the leader of the former may shake hands with his men and<br>utter loud cries to effect, 'The enemy has broken! The enemy has broken!'<br>Those among them that are endued with strength should resist the enemy,<br>loudly unto their comrades, 'Fresh friends have arrived! Fearlessly<br>strike at your foes!' Those that are in advance of the rest should utter<br>loud shouts and make diverse kinds of noises, and should blow and beat<br>Krakachas, cow-horns, drums, cymbals, and kettle-drums.'"
