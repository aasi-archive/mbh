                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I wish, O sire, to hear the settled conclusions on<br>the subject of Virtue, Wealth, and Pleasure. Depending upon which of<br>these does the course of life proceed? What are the respective roots of<br>Virtue, Wealth, and Pleasure? What are again the results of those three?<br>They are sometimes see n to mingle with one another, and sometimes to<br>exist separately and independently of one another.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'When men in this world endeavour with good hearts to<br>achieve Wealth with the aid of Virtue, then those three, viz., Virtue,<br>Wealth, and Pleasure, may be seen to co-exist in a state of union in<br>respect of time, cause, and action.[374] Wealth has its root in Virtue,<br>and Pleasure is said to be the fruit of Wealth. All the three again have<br>their root in Will. Will is concerned with objects. All objects, again,<br>in their entirety, exist for gratifying the desire of enjoyment. Upon<br>these then does the aggregate of three depend. Entire abstraction from<br>all objects is Emancipation. It is said that Virtue is sought for the<br>protection of the body, and Wealth is for the acquisition of Virtue.<br>Pleasure is only the gratification of the senses. All the three have,<br>therefore, the quality of Passion.[375] Virtue, Wealth, and Pleasure,<br>when sought for the sake of heaven or such other rewards, are said to be<br>remote because the rewards themselves are remote. When sought, however,<br>for the sake of Knowledge of Self, they are said to be proximate. One<br>should seek them when they are of such a character.[376] One should not<br>cast them off even mentally. If Virtue, Wealth, and Pleasure are to be<br>abandoned, one should abandon them when one has freed one's self by<br>ascetic penances.[377] The aim of the triple aggregate is towards<br>emancipation. Would that man could obtain it! One's acts, undertaken and<br>completed with eve tithe aid of intelligence may or may not lead to the<br>expected results. Virtue is not always the root of Wealth, for other<br>things than Virtue lead to Wealth (such as service, agriculture, &c).<br>There is again a contrary opinion (for some say that Wealth is earned<br>through chance or birth or like causes). In some instances, Wealth<br>acquired has been productive of evil. Other things again that Wealth<br>(such as fasts and vows) have led to the acquisition of Virtue. As<br>regards this topic, therefore, a dullard whose understanding has been<br>debased by ignorance, never succeeds in acquiring the highest aim of<br>Virtue and Wealth, viz., Emancipation. Virtue's dross consists in the<br>desire of reward; the dross of Wealth consists in hoarding it; when<br>purged of these impurities, they are productive of great results. In this<br>connection is cited the narrative of the discourse that look place in<br>days of old between Kamandaka and Angaristha. One day, king Angaristha,<br>having waited for the opportunity, saluted the Rishi Kamandaka as he was<br>seated at his ease and asked him the following questions, 'If a king,<br>forced by lust and folly, commits sin for which he afterwards repents, by<br>what acts, O Rishi, can those sins be destroyed? If again a man impelled<br>by ignorance, does what is sinful in the belief that he is acting<br>righteously, how shall the king put a stop to that sin come into vogue<br>among men?'<br><br>"Kamandaka said, 'That man who, abandoning Virtue and Wealth pursues only<br>Pleasure, reaps as the consequence of such conduct the destruction of his<br>intelligence. The destruction of intelligence is followed by heedlessness<br>that is at once destructive of both Virtue and Wealth. From such<br>heedlessness proceed dire atheism and systematic wickedness of conduct.<br>If the king does not restrain those wicked men of sinful conduct, all<br>good subjects then live in fear of him like the inmate of a room within<br>which a snake has concealed itself. The subjects do not follow such a<br>king. Brahmanas and all pious persons also act in the same way. As a<br>consequence the king incurs great danger, and ultimately the risk of<br>destruction itself. Overtaken by infamy and insult, he has to drag on a<br>miserable existence. A life of infamy, however, is equal to death. Men<br>learned in the scriptures have indicated the following means for checking<br>sin. The king should always devote himself to the study of the three<br>Vedas. He should respect the Brahmanas and do good offices unto them. He<br>should be devoted to righteousness. He should make alliance (of marriage)<br>with high families. He should wait upon high-minded Brahmanas adorned<br>with the virtue of forgiveness. He should perform ablutions and recite<br>sacred mantras and thus pass his time happily. Banishing all wicked<br>subjects from himself and his kingdom, he should seek the companionship<br>of virtuous men. He should gratify all persons by speeches or good acts.<br>He should say unto all&#8212;'I am yours,'&#8212;proclaim the virtues of even his<br>foes. By pursuing such conduct he may soon cleanse himself of his sins<br>and win the high regard of all. Without doubt, by conduct such as this<br>all his sins will be destroyed. Thou shouldst accomplish all those high<br>duties which thy seniors and preceptors would indicate. Thou art sure to<br>obtain great blessing through the grace of thy seniors and preceptors.'"
