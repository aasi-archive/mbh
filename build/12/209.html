                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, O thou of great wisdom and invincible<br>prowess in battle, I wish to hear in detail of Krishna who is immutable<br>and omnipotent. O bull among men, tell me truly everything about his<br>great energy and the great feats achieved by him in days of old. Why did<br>that puissant one assume the form of an animal, and for achieving what<br>particular act? Tell me all this, O mighty warrior!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Formerly, on one occasion, while out ahunting, I arrived<br>at the hermitage of Markandeya. There I beheld diverse classes of<br>ascetics seated by thousands. The Rishis honoured me by the offer of<br>honey and curds. Accepting their worship, I reverentially saluted them in<br>return. The following that I shall recite was narrated there by the great<br>Rishi Kasyapa. Listen with close attention to that excellent and charming<br>account. In former days, the principal Danavas, endued with wrath and<br>cupidity, and mighty Asuras numbering by hundreds and drunk with might,<br>and innumerable other Danavas that were invincible in battle, became<br>exceedingly jealous of the unrivalled prosperity of the gods. Oppressed<br>(at last) by the Danavas, the gods and the celestial Rishis, failing to<br>obtain peace, fled away in all directions. The denizens of heaven saw the<br>earth looking like one sunk in sore distress. Overspread with mighty<br>Danavas of terrible mien, the earth seemed to be oppressed with a heavy<br>weight. Cheerless and griefstricken, she seemed as if going down into the<br>nether depths. The Adityas, struck with fear, repaired to Brahman, and<br>addressing him, said, 'How, O Brahman, shall we continue to bear these<br>oppressions of the Danavas?' The Self-born answered them, saying, 'I have<br>already ordained what is to be done in this matter. Endued with boons,<br>and possessed of might, and swelling with pride, those senseless wretches<br>do not know that Vishnu of invisible form, that God incapable of being<br>vanquished by the very deities all acting together, hath assumed the form<br>of a boar. That Supreme Deity, rushing to the spot whither those wretches<br>among Danavas, of terrible aspect, are dwelling in thousands below the<br>earth, will slay them all.' Hearing these words of the Grandsire,<br>foremost ones among the deities felt great joy. Sometime after, Vishnu<br>those of mighty energy, encased in the form of a Boar, penetrating into<br>the nether regions, rushed against those offspring of Diti. Beholding<br>that extraordinary creature, all the Daityas, uniting together and<br>stupefied by Time, quickly proceeded against it for exerting their<br>strength, and stood surrounding it. Soon after, they all rushed against<br>that Boar and seized it simultaneously. Filled with rage they endeavoured<br>to drag the animal from every side. Those foremost of Danavas, of huge<br>bodies, possessed of mighty energy, swelling with strength, succeeded<br>not, however, O monarch, in doing anything to that Boar. At this they<br>wondered much and then became filled with fear. Numbering in thousands,<br>they regarded that their last hour had come. Then that Supreme God of all<br>the gods, having yoga for his soul and yoga for his companion, became<br>rapt in yoga, O chief of the Bharatas, and began to utter tremendous<br>roars, agitating those Daityas and Danavas. All the worlds and the ten<br>points of the compass resounded with those roars, which, for this reason,<br>agitated all creatures and filled them with fear. The very gods with<br>Indra at their head became terror-stricken. The whole universe became<br>stilled in consequence of that sound. It was a dreadful time. All mobile<br>and immobile beings became stupefied by that sound. The Danavas,<br>terrified by that sound, began to fall down lifeless, paralysed by the<br>energy of Vishnu. The Boar, with its hoofs, began to pierce those enemies<br>of the gods, those denizens of the nether regions, and tear their flesh,<br>fat, and bones. In consequence of those tremendous roars, Vishnu came to<br>be called by the name of Sanatana.[712] He is also called Padmanabha. He<br>is the foremost of yogins. He is the Preceptor of all creatures, and<br>their supreme Lord. All the tribes of the gods then repaired to the<br>Grandsire. Arrived at the presence, those illustrious ones a dressed the<br>Lord of the universe, saying, 'What sort of a noise is this, O puissant<br>one? We do not understand it. Who is this one, or whose is this sound at<br>which the universe hath been stupefied? With the energy of this sound or<br>of its maker, the gods and the Danavas have all been deprived of their<br>senses.' Meanwhile, O mighty-armed one, Vishnu in his porcine form was in<br>sight of the assembled gods, his praises hymned by the great Rishis.'<br><br>"The Grandsire said, 'That is the Supreme God, the Creator of all beings,<br>the soul of all creatures, the foremost of all yogins. Of huge body and<br>great strength, he cometh here, having slain the foremost ones among the<br>Danavas. He is the Lord of all beings, the master of yoga, the great<br>ascetic, the Soul of all living beings. Be still, all of you. He is<br>Krishna, the destroyer of all obstacles and impediments.[713] That<br>Supreme God, of immeasurable splendour, that great refuge of all<br>blessings, having achieved a most difficult feat that is incapable of<br>being accomplished by others, has returned to his own unmixed<br>nature.[714] It is He from whose navel the primeval lotus had sprung. He<br>is the foremost of yogins. Of supreme soul, He is the creator of all<br>beings. There is no need for sorrow or fear or grief, ye foremost of<br>gods! He is the Ordainer. He is the Creating Principle. He is<br>all-destroying Time. It is He who upholds all the world. The roars that<br>have alarmed you are being uttered by that high-souled one. Of mighty<br>arms, He is the object of the universal worship. Incapable of<br>deterioration, that lotus-eyed one is the origin of all beings and their<br>lord.'"
