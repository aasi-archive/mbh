                            "Yudhishthira said, 'What, O grandsire, should be the acts and what the<br>behaviour of persons employed as priests in our sacrifices? What sort of<br>persons should they be, O king? Tell me all this, O foremost of speakers.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'It is laid down from those Brahmanas that are eligible as<br>priests that they should be conversant with the Chhandas including the<br>Samans, and all the rites inculcated in the Srutis, and that they should<br>be able to perform all such religious acts as lead to the prosperity of<br>the king. They should be devotedly loyal and utter agreeable speeches in<br>addressing kings. They should also be friendly towards one another, and<br>cast equal eyes on all. They should be devoid of cruelty, and truthful in<br>speech. They should never be usurers, and should always be simple and<br>sincere. One that is peaceful in temper, destitute of vanity, modest,<br>charitable, self-restrained, and contented, possessed of intelligence,<br>truthful, observant of vows, and harmless to all creatures, without lust<br>and malice, and endued with the three excellent qualities, devoid of envy<br>and possessed of knowledge, deserves the seat of Brahman himself. Persons<br>with such qualities, O sire, are the best of priests and deserve every<br>respect.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'There are Vedic texts about the gift of Dakshina in<br>sacrifices. There is no ordinance, however, which lays down that so much<br>should be given. This ordinance (about the gift of Dakshina) has not<br>proceeded from motives connected with the distribution of wealth. The<br>command of the ordinance, in consequence of the provision in cases of<br>incapacity, is terrible. That command is blind to the competence of the<br>sacrificer.[237] The audition occurs in the Vedas that a person should,<br>with devotion, perform a sacrifice. But what can devotion do when the<br>sacrificer is stained by falsehood?[238]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'No man acquires blessedness or merit by disregarding the<br>Vedas or by deceit or falsehood. Never think that it is otherwise.<br>Dakshina constitutes one of the limbs of sacrifice and conduces to the<br>nourishment of the Vedas. A sacrifice without Dakshina can never lead to<br>salvation. The efficacy, however, of a single Purnapatra is equal to that<br>of any Dakshina, however rich. Therefore, O sire, everyone belonging to<br>the three orders should perform sacrifices.[239] The Vedas have settled<br>that Soma is as the king himself to the Brahmanas. Yet they desire to<br>sell it for the sake of performing sacrifices, though they never wish to<br>sell it for gaining a livelihood. Rishis of righteous behaviour have<br>declared, agreeably to the dictates of morality, that a sacrifice<br>performed with the proceeds of the sale of Soma serves to extend<br>sacrifices.[240] These three, viz., a person, a sacrifice and Soma, must<br>be of good character. A person that is of bad character is neither for<br>this nor for the other world. This audition has been heard by us that the<br>sacrifice which high-souled Brahmanas perform by wealth earned by<br>excessive physical labour, is not productive of great merit. There is a<br>declaration in the Vedas that penances are higher than sacrifices. I<br>shall now speak to thee of penances. O learned prince, listen to me.<br>Abstention from injury, truthfulness of speech, benevolence,<br>compassion,&#8212;these are regarded as penances by the wise and not the<br>emaciation of the body. Disregard of the Vedas, disobedience to the<br>dictates of the scriptures, and violation of all wholesome restraints,<br>are productive of self-destruction. Listen, O son of Pritha, to what has<br>been laid down by those that pour ten libations upon the fire at ten<br>times of the day.&#8212;For them that perform the sacrifice of penance, the<br>Yoga they endeavour to effect with Brahma is their ladle; the heart is<br>their clarified butter; and high knowledge constitutes their<br>Pavitra.[241] All kinds of crookedness mean death, and all kinds of<br>sincerity are called Brahma. This constitutes the subject of knowledge.<br>The rhapsodies of system-builders cannot affect this.&#8212;'"
