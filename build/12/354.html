                            "Bhishma said, 'In an excellent town called by the name of Mahapadma<br>which was situate on the southern side of the river Ganga, there lived,<br><br>O, best of men, a Brahmana of concentrated soul. Born in the race of<br>Atri, he was endued with amiability. All his doubts had been dispelled<br>(by faith and contemplation) and he was well conversant with the path he<br>was to follow. Ever observant of the religious duties, he had his anger<br>under perfect control. Always contented, he was the, complete master of<br>his senses. Devoted to penances and study of the Vedas, he was honoured<br>by all good men. He earned wealth by righteous means and his conduct in<br>all things corresponded with the mode of life he led and the order to<br>which he belonged. The family to which he belonged was large and<br>celebrated. He had many kinsmen and relatives, and many children and<br>spouses. His behaviour was always respectable and faultless. Observing<br>that he had many children, the Brahmana betook himself to the<br>accomplishment of religious acts on a large scale. His religious<br>observances, O king, had reference to the customs of his own<br>family.[1926] The Brahmana reflected that three kinds of duties have been<br>laid down for observances. There were first, the duties ordained in the<br>Vedas in respect of the order in which he was born and the mode of life<br>he was leading (viz., a Brahmana in the observance of domesticity). There<br>were secondly, the duties prescribed in the scriptures, viz., those<br>especially called the Dharmasastras. And, thirdly, there were those<br>duties that eminent and revered men of former times have followed though<br>not occurring either in the Vedas or the scriptures.[1927] Which of these<br>duties should I follow? Which of them, again, followed by me, are likely<br>to lead to my benefit? Which, indeed, should be my refuge?&#8212;Thoughts like<br>these always troubled him. He could not solve his doubts. While troubled<br>with such reflections, a Brahmana of concentrated soul and observant of a<br>very superior religion, came to his house as a guest. The house-holder<br>duly honoured his guest according to those ordinances of worship that are<br>laid down in the scriptures. Beholding his guest refreshed and seated at<br>ease, the host addressed him in the following words."<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'O sinless one, I have become exceedingly attached to<br>thee in consequence of the sweetness of thy conversation. Thou hast<br>become my friend. Listen to me, for I wish to say something unto thee. O<br>foremost of Brahmanas, after making over the duties of a householder to<br>my son, I wish to discharge the highest duties of man. What, O regenerate<br>one, should be my path? Relying upon the Jiva soul, I wish to achieve<br>existence in the one (supreme) soul. Alas, bound up in the ties of<br>attachment, I have not the heart to actually set myself to the<br>accomplishment of that task.[1928] And since the best portion of my life<br>has passed away in the observance of domesticity, I desire to devote the<br>remnant of my life in earning the means of defraying the expenses of my<br>journey in respect of the time to come. The desire has arisen in my mind<br>of crossing the ocean of the world. Alas, whence shall I get the raft of<br>religion (with which to accomplish my purposes)? Hearing that even the<br>very deities are persecuted and made to endure the fruits of their acts,<br>and beholding the rows of Yama's standards and flags floating over the<br>heads of all creatures, my heart fails to derive pleasure from the<br>diverse objects of pleasure with which it comes into contact. Beholding<br>also that the Yatis depend for their sustenance upon alms obtained in<br>course of their rounds of mendicancy, I have no respect for the religion<br>of the Yatis as well. O my reverend guest, do thou, aided by that<br>religion which is founded upon the basis of intelligence and reason, set<br>me to the observance of a particular course of duties and<br>observance![1929]'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Endued with great wisdom, the guest, hearing this<br>speech of his host which was consistent with righteousness, said these<br>sweet words in a melodious voice.'<br><br>"The guest said, 'I myself also am confounded with respect to this topic.<br>The same thought occupies my mind. I am unable to arrive at definite<br>conclusions. Heaven has many doors. There are some that applaud<br>Emancipation. Some regenerate persons praise the fruits attainable by the<br>performance of sacrifices. Some there are that take refuge in the forest<br>mode of life. Some, again, betake themselves to the domestic mode of<br>life. Some rely upon the merits attainable by an observance of the duties<br>of kings. Some rely upon the fruits of that culture which consists in<br>restraining the soul. Some think that the merits resulting from a dutiful<br>obedience to preceptors and seniors are efficacious. Some betake<br>themselves to restraints imposed on speech. Some by waiting dutifully<br>upon their mothers and fathers, have gone to heaven. Some have ascended<br>to heaven by practising the duty of compassion, and some by practising<br>Truth. Some rush to battle, and after laying down their lives, have<br>attained to heaven. Some, again, attaining to success by practising the<br>vow called Unccha, have betaken themselves to the path of heaven. Some<br>have devoted themselves to the study of the Vedas. Endued with<br>auspiciousness and wedded to such study, these men, possessed of<br>intelligence, with tranquil souls, and having their senses under complete<br>control, attain to heaven. Others characterised by simplicity and truth,<br>have been slain by men of wickedness. Endued with pure souls, such men of<br>truth and simplicity, have become honoured denizens of heaven. In this<br>world, it is seen, that men betake themselves to heaven, through a<br>thousand doors of duty, all standing wide open. My understanding has been<br>troubled by thy question, like a fleecy cloud before the wind.'"
