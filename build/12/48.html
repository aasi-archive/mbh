                            "Janamejaya said, 'How did the grandsire of the Bharatas, who lay on a<br>bed of arrows, cast off his body and what kind of Yoga did he adopt?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Listen, O king, with pure heart and concentrated<br>attention, as to how, O tiger among the Kurus, the high-souled Bhishma<br>cast off his body. As soon as the Sun, passing the solstitial point,<br>entered in his northerly course, Bhishma, with concentrated attention,<br>caused his soul (as connected with and independent of the body) to enter<br>his soul (in its independent and absolute state). Surrounded by many<br>foremost of Brahmanas, that hero, his body pierced with innumerable<br>arrows, blazed forth in great beauty like Surya himself with his<br>innumerable rays. Surrounded by Vyasa conversant with the Vedas by the<br>celestial Rishi Narada, by Devasthana, by Asmaka Sumantu, by Jaimini, by<br>the high-souled Paila, by Sandilya, by Devarata, by Maitreya of great<br>intelligence, by Asita and Vasishtha and the high-souled Kausika, by<br>Harita and Lomasa and Atri's son of great intelligence, by Vrihaspati and<br>Sukra and the great sage Chyavana, by Sanatkumara and Kapila and Valmiki<br>and Tumvuru and Kuru, by Maudgalya and Rama of Bhrigu's race, and the<br>great sage Trinavindu, by Pippalada and Vayu and Samvarta and Pulaha and<br>Katha, by Kasyapa and Pulastya and Kratu and Daksha and Parasara, by<br>Marichi and Angiras and Kasmya and Gautama and the sage Galava, by<br>Dhaumya and Vibhanda and Mandavya and Dhaumra and Krishnanubhautika, by<br>Uluka, that foremost of Brahmanas and the great sage Markandeya, by<br>Bhaskari and Purana and Krishna and Suta,&#8212;that foremost of virtuous<br>persons, surrounded by these and many other highly-blessed sages of great<br>souls and possessed of faith and self-restraint and tranquillity of mind,<br>the Kuru hero looked like the Moon in the midst of the planets and the<br>stars. Stretched on his bed of arrows, that tiger among men, Bhishma,<br>with pure heart and joined palms, thought of Krishna in mind, word, and<br>act. With a cheerful and strong voice he hymned the praise of the slayer<br>of Madhu, that master of yoga, with the lotus in his navel, that lord of<br>the universe, called Vishnu and Jishnu. With joined hands, that foremost<br>of eloquent men, that puissant one, viz., Bhishma of highly virtuous<br>soul, thus praised Vasudeva.<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O Krishna, O foremost of Beings, be thou pleased with<br>these words which I utter, in brief and in detail, from desire of hymning<br>thy praises. Thou art pure and purity's self. Thou transcendest all. Thou<br>art what people say to be THAT. Thou art the Supreme Lord. With my whole<br>heart I seek thy refuge, O universal Soul and Lord of all creatures![137]<br>Thou art without beginning and without end. Thou art the highest of the<br>high and Brahma. Neither the gods nor the Rishis know thee. The divine<br>Creator, called Narayana or Hari, alone knows thee. Through Narayana, the<br>Rishis, the Siddhas, the great Nagas, the gods, and the celestial Rishis<br>know a little of thee. Thou art the highest of the high and knowest no<br>deterioration. The gods, the Danavas, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the<br>Pannagas, do not know who thou art and whence art thou. All the worlds<br>and all created things live in thee, and enter thee (when the dissolution<br>comes). Like gems strung together in a thread, all things that have<br>attributes reside in thee, the Supreme Lord.'[138] Having the universe<br>for thy work and the universe for thy limbs, this universe consisting of<br>mind and matter resides in thy eternal and all-pervading soul like a<br>number of flowers strung together in a strong thread. Thou art called<br>Hari, of a thousand heads, a thousand feet, a thousand eyes, a thousand<br>arms, a thousand crowns, and a thousand faces of great splendour. Thou<br>art called Narayana, divinity, and the refuge of the universe. Thou art<br>the subtlest of the subtle, grossest of the gross, the heaviest of the<br>heavy and the highest of the high. In the Vaks, the Anuvaks, the Nishads,<br>and Upanishads, thou art regarded as the Supreme Being of irresistible<br>force. In the Samans also, whose declarations are always true, thou art<br>regarded as Truth's self![139] Thou art of quadruple soul. Thou art<br>displayed in only the understanding (of all creatures). Thou art the Lord<br>of those that are bound to thee in faith. O God, thou art adored (by the<br>faithful) under four excellent, high, and secret names.[140] Penances are<br>ever present in thee. Performed (by other creatures for gratifying thee),<br>penances live in thy form. Thou art the Universal Soul. Thou art of<br>universal knowledge. Thou art the universe. Thou art omniscient. Thou art<br>the creator of everything in the universe.[141] Like a couple of sticks<br>generating a blazing fire, thou hast been born of the divine Devaki and<br>Vasudeva for the protection of Brahma on earth.[142] For this eternal<br>salvation, the devout worshipper, with mind withdrawn from everything<br>else and casting off all desires, beholds thee, O Govinda, that art the<br>pure Soul, in his own soul. Thou transcendest Surya in glory. Thou art<br>beyond the ken of the senses and the understanding. O Lord of all<br>creatures, I place myself in thy hands. In the Puranas thou hast been<br>spoken as Purusha (all-pervading spirit). On occasions of the<br>commencement of the Yugas, thou art said to be Brahma, while on occasions<br>of universal dissolution thou art spoken of as Sankarshana. Adorable thou<br>art, and therefore I adore thee. Though one, thou hast yet been born in<br>innumerable forms. Thou hast thy passions under complete control. Thy<br>devout worshippers, faithfully performing the rites laid down in the<br>scriptures, sacrifice to thee, O giver of every wish! Thou art called the<br>sheath within which the universe lies. All created things live in thee.<br>Like swans and ducks swimming on the water, all the worlds that we see<br>float in thee. Thou art Truth. Thou art One and undeteriorating. Thou art<br>Brahma, Thou art That which is beyond Mind and Matter. Thou art without<br>beginning, middle, and end. Neither the gods nor the Rishis know thee.<br>The gods, the Asuras, the Gandharvas, the Siddhas, the Rishis, and the<br>great Uragas with concentrated souls, always adore thee. Thou art the<br>great panacea for all sorrow. Thou art without birth and death. Thou art<br>Divine. Thou art self-created. Thou art eternal. Thou art invisible and<br>beyond ken. Thou art called Hari and Narayana, O puissant one. The Vedas<br>declare thee to be the Creator of the universe and the Lord of everything<br>existing in the universe. Thou art the Supreme protector of the universe.<br>Thou knowest no deterioration and thou art that which is called the<br>highest. Thou art of the complexion of gold. Thou art the slayer of<br>Asuras. Though One, Aditi brought thee forth in twelve forms.[143]<br>Salutations to thee that art the soul of the Sun. Salutations to thee in<br>thy form of Soma that is spoken of as the chief of all the regenerate<br>ones and that gratifies with nectar the gods in the lighted fortnight and<br>the Pitris in the dark fortnight. Thou art the One Being of transcendent<br>effulgence dwelling on the other side of thick darkness. Knowing thee one<br>ceases to have any fear of death. Salutations to thee in that form which<br>is an object of knowledge.[144] In the grand Uktha sacrifice, the<br>Brahmanas adore thee as the great Rich. In the great fire-sacrifice, they<br>sing thee as the chief Adhyaryu (priest). Thou art the soul of the Vedas.<br>Salutations to thee. The Richs, the Yajus, and the Samans are thy abode.<br>Thou art the five kinds of sanctified libations (used in sacrifices).<br>Thou art the seven woofs used in the Vedas. Salutations to thee in thy<br>form of Sacrifice.[145] Libations are poured on the Homa fire in<br>accompaniment with the seventeen monosyllabic sounds. Thou art the soul<br>of the Homa. Salutations to thee! Thou art that Purusha whom the Vedas<br>sing. Thy name is Yajus. The Vedic metres are thy limbs. The sacrifices<br>laid down in the three Vedas are thy three heads. The great sacrifice<br>called Rathantara is thy voice expressive of gratification. Salutation to<br>thee in thy form of sacred hymns! Thou art the Rishi that hadst appeared<br>in the great sacrifice extending for a thousand years performed by the<br>creators of the universe. Thou art the great swan with wings of gold.<br>Salutations to thee in thy form of a swan.[146] Roots with all kinds of<br>affixes and suffixes are thy limbs. The Sandhis are thy joints. The<br>consonants and the vowels are thy ornaments. The Vedas have declared thee<br>to be the divine word. Salutations to thee in thy form as the word![147]<br>Assuming the form of a boar whose limbs were constituted by sacrifice,<br>thou hadst raised the submerged earth for the benefit of the three<br>worlds. Salutations to thee in thy form of infinite prowess! Thou<br>sleepest in Yoga on thy snake-decked sofa constituted by the thousand<br>hoods (of the Naga). Salutations to thee in thy form of sleep! Thou<br>buildest the bridge for the good (to cross the sea of life) with Truth,<br>with those means by which emancipation may be obtained, and with the<br>means by which the senses may be controlled. Salutations to thee in thy<br>form of Truth! Men practising diverse creeds, actuated by desire of<br>diverse fruits worship thee with diverse rites. Salutations to thee in<br>thy form of Creed! From thee have all things sprung. It is thou that<br>excitest all creatures having physical frames containing the principle of<br>desire. Salutations to thee in thy form of Excitement. The great Rishis<br>seek thy unmanifest self within the manifest. Called Kshetrajna, thou<br>sittest in Kshetra. Salutations to thee in thy form of Kshetra![148] Thou<br>always conscious and present in self, the Sankhyas still describe thee as<br>existing in the three states of wakefulness, dream, and sound sleep. They<br>further speak of thee as possessed of sixteen attributes and representing<br>the number seventeen. Salutations to thy form as conceived by the<br>Sankhyas![149] Casting off sleep, restraining breath, withdrawn into<br>their own selves, Yogins of restrained senses behold thee as eternal<br>light. Salutations to thee in thy Yoga form! Peaceful Sannyasins, freed<br>from fear of rebirth in consequence of the destruction of all their sins<br>and merits, obtain thee. Salutations to thee in thy form of<br>emancipation![150] At the end of a thousand Yugas, thou assumest the form<br>of a fire with blazing flames and consumest all creatures. Salutations to<br>thee in thy form of fierceness! Having consumed all creatures and making<br>the universe one vast expanse of water, thou sleepest on the waters in<br>the form of a child. Salutations to thee in thy form as Maya (illusion)!<br>From the navel of the Self-born of eyes like lotus leaves, sprang a<br>lotus. On that lotus is established this universe. Salutations to thee in<br>thy form as lotus! Thou hast a thousand heads. Thou pervadest everything.<br>Thou art of immeasurable soul. Thou hast subjugated the four kinds of<br>desire that are as vast as the four oceans. Salutations to thee in thy<br>form of Yoga-sleep! The clouds are in the hair of thy head. The rivers<br>are in the several joints of thy limbs. The four oceans are in thy<br>stomach. Salutations to thee in thy form as water! Birth and the change<br>represented by death spring from thee. All things, again, at the<br>universal dissolution dissolve away in thee. Salutations to thy form as<br>cause! Thou sleepest not in the night. Thou art occupied in day time<br>also. Thou observest the good and the bad actions (of all). Salutations<br>to thee in thy form of (universal) observer! There is no act which thou<br>canst not do. Thou art, again, ever ready to accomplish acts that are<br>righteous. Salutations to thee in thy form of Work, the form, viz., which<br>is called Vaikuntha! In wrath thou hadst, in battle, exterminated thrice<br>seven times the Kshatriyas who had trampled virtue and authority under<br>their feet. Salutations to thee in thy form of Cruelty! Dividing thyself<br>into five portions thou hast become the five vital breaths that act<br>within everybody and cause every living creature to move. Salutations to<br>thee in thy form of air! Thou appearest in every Yuga in the form called<br>month and season and half-year and year, and art the cause of both<br>creation and dissolution. Salutations to thee in thy form of Time!<br>Brahmanas are thy mouth, Kshatriyas are thy two arms, Vaisyas are thy<br>stomach and thighs, and Sudras live in thy feet. Salutations to thee in<br>thy form of caste! Fire constitute thy mouth. The heavens are the crown<br>of thy head. The sky is thy navel. The earth is thy feet. The Sun is thy<br>eye. The points of the compass are thy ears. Salutations to thee in thy<br>form as the (three) worlds! Thou art superior to Time. Thou art superior<br>to Sacrifice. Thou art higher than the highest. Thyself without origin,<br>thou art the origin of the universe. Salutations to thee in thy form as<br>Universe! Men of the world, according to the attributes ascribed to thee<br>by the Vaiseshika theory, regard thee as the Protector of the world.<br>Salutations to thee in thy form of Protector! Assuming the forms of food,<br>drink, and fuel, thou increasest the humours and the life-breaths of<br>creatures and upholdest their existence. Salutations to thee in thy form<br>of life! For supporting the life-breaths thou eatest the four kinds of<br>food.[151] Assuming also the form of Agni within the stomach, thou<br>digestest that food. Salutations to thee in the form of digesting heat!<br>Assuming the form of half-man and half-lion, with tawny eyes and tawny<br>manes, with teeth and claws for thy weapons, thou hadst taken the life of<br>the chief of the Asuras. Salutations to thee in thy form of swelling<br>might! Neither the gods, nor the Gandharvas, nor the Daityas, nor the<br>Danavas, know thee truly. Salutations to thy form of exceeding subtility!<br>Assuming the form of the handsome, illustrious, and puissant Ananta in<br>the nether region, thou upholdest the world. Salutations to thy form of<br>Might! Thou stupefiest all creatures by the bonds of affection and love<br>for the continuance of the creation. Salutations to thee in thy form of<br>stupefaction.[152] Regarding that knowledge which is conversant with the<br>five elements to be the true Self-knowledge (for which yogins strive),<br>people approach thee by knowledge! Salutations to thee in thy form of<br>Knowledge! Thy body is immeasurable. Thy understanding and eyes are<br>devoted to everything. Thou art infinite, being beyond all measures.<br>Salutations to thee in thy form of vastness! Thou hadst assumed the form<br>of a recluse with matted locks on head, staff in hand, a long stomach,<br>and having thy begging bowl for thy quiver. Salutations to thee in thy<br>form of Brahma.[153] Thou bearest the trident, thou art the lord of the<br>celestials, thou hast three eyes, and thou art high-souled. Thy body is<br>always besmeared with ashes, and thy phallic emblem is always turned<br>upwards. Salutations to thee in thy form of Rudra! The half-moon forms<br>the ornament of thy forehead. Thou hast snakes for the holy thread<br>circling thy neck. Thou art armed with Pinaka and trident. Salutations to<br>thy form of Fierceness! Thou art the soul of all creatures. Thou art the<br>Creator and the Destroyer of all creatures. Thou art without wrath,<br>without enmity, without affection. Salutations to thee in thy form of<br>Peace! Everything is in thee. Everything is from thee. Thyself art<br>Everything. Everywhere art thou. Thou art always the All. Salutations to<br>thee in thy form as Everything! Salutations to thee whose work is the<br>universe, to thee that art the soul of the universe, to thee from whom<br>hath sprung the universe, to thee that art the dissolution of all things,<br>to thee that are beyond the five (elements that constitute all things)!<br>Salutations to thee that art the three worlds, to thee that art above the<br>three worlds! Salutations to thee that art all the directions! Thou art<br>all and thou art the one receptacle of All. Salutations to thee, O divine<br>Lord, O Vishnu, and O eternal origin of all the worlds! Thou, O<br>Hrishikesa, art the Creator, thou art the Destroyer, and thou art<br>invincible. I cannot behold that heavenly form in which thou art<br>displayed in the Past, Present, and the Future. I can, however, behold<br>truly thy eternal form (as manifest in thy works). Thou hast filled<br>heaven with thy head, and the earth with thy feet: with thy prowess thou<br>hast filled the three worlds. Thou art Eternal and thou pervadest<br>everything in the universe. The directions are thy arms, the Sun is thy<br>eye, and prowess is thy vital fluid. Thou art the lord of all creatures.<br>Thou standest, shutting up the seven paths of the Wind whose energy is<br>immeasurable. They are freed from all feats that worship thee, O Govinda<br>of unfading prowess, thee that art attired in yellow robes of the colour<br>of the Atasi flower.[154] Even one bending of the head unto thee, O<br>Krishna, is equal to the completion of ten Horse-sacrifices. The man that<br>has performed ten Horse-sacrifices is not freed from the obligation of<br>rebirth. The man, however, that bows to Krishna escapes rebirth. They<br>that have Krishna for their vow, they that think of Krishna in the night,<br>and upon rising from sleep, may be said to have Krishna for their body.<br>Those people (after death) enter Krishna's self even as libations of<br>clarified butter sanctified with mantras enter the blazing fire.<br>Salutations to thee that dispellest the fear of hell, to thee, O Vishnu,<br>that art a boat unto them that are plunged amid the eddies of the ocean<br>represented by worldly life! Salutations to thee, O God, that art the<br>Brahmana's self, to thee that art the benefactor of Brahmanas and kine,<br>to thee that art the benefactor of the universe, to thee that art Krishna<br>and Govinda! The two syllables Hari constitute the pecuniary stock of<br>those that sojourn through the wilderness of life and the medicine that<br>effectually cures all worldly, predilections, besides being the means<br>that alleviate sorrow and grief.[155] As truth is full of Vishnu, as the<br>universe is full of Vishnu, as everything is full of Vishnu, so let my<br>soul be full of Vishnu and my sins be destroyed! I seek thy protection<br>and am devoted to thee, desirous of obtaining a happy end O thou of eyes<br>like lotus petals, O best of gods, do thou think of what will be for my<br>good! Thyself without origin, O Vishnu, thou art the origin of Knowledge<br>and Penances. Thus art thou praised! O Janardana, thus worshipped by me<br>in the Sacrifice constituted by speech (alone), be, O god, gratified with<br>me! The Vedas are devoted to Narayana. Penances are devoted to Narayana.<br>The gods are devoted to Narayana. Everything is always Narayana!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having uttered these words, Bhishma, with mind<br>concentrated upon Krishna, said, 'Salutations to Krishna!' and bowed unto<br>him. Learning by his Yoga prowess of the devotion of Bhishma, Madhava,<br>otherwise called Hari, (entering his body) bestowed upon him heavenly<br>knowledge compassing the Past, the Present, and the Future, and went<br>away. When Bhishma became silent, those utterers of Brahma (that sat<br>around him), with voices choked in tears, adored that high-souled chief<br>of the Kurus in excellent words. Those foremost of Brahmanas uttered the<br>praises of Krishna also, that first of Beings, and then continued in soft<br>voices to commend Bhishma repeatedly. Learning (by his Yoga powers) of<br>the devotion of Bhishma towards him, that foremost of Beings, viz.,<br>Madhava, suddenly rose from his seat and ascended on his car, Kesava and<br>Satyaki proceeded on one car. On another proceeded those two illustrious<br>princes, viz., Yudhishthira and Dhananjaya. Bhimasena and the twins rode<br>on a third; while those bulls among men, Kripa and Yuyutsu, and that<br>scorcher of foes, Sanjaya of the Suta caste, proceeded on their<br>respective cars, each of which looked like a town. And all of them<br>proceeded, causing the earth to tremble with the rattle of their<br>chariot-wheels. That foremost of men, as he proceeded, cheerfully<br>listened to the speeches, fraught with his praise, that were uttered by<br>the Brahmanas. The slayer of Kesi, with gladdened heart, saluted the<br>people that waited (along the streets) with joined hands and bent heads."
