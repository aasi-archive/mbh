                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, what is Adhyatma with respect<br>to man and whence it arises.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Aided by the science of Adhyatma one may know everything.<br>It is, again, superior to all things. I shall, with the help of my<br>intelligence, explain to thee that Adhyatma about which thou askest me.<br>Listen, O son, to my explanation. Earth, Wind, Space, Water, and Light<br>forming the fifth, are the great essences. These are (the causes of) the<br>origin and the destruction of all creatures. The bodies of living<br>creatures (both subtile and gross), O bull of Bharata's race, are the<br>result of the combination of the virtues of these five. Those virtues<br>(whose combinations produce the bodies of creatures) repeatedly start<br>into existence and repeatedly merge into the original cause of all<br>things, viz., the Supreme Soul.[1442] From those five primal essences are<br>created all creatures, and into those five great elements all creatures<br>resolve themselves, repeatedly, like the infinite waves of the Ocean<br>rising from the Ocean and subsiding into that which causes them. As a<br>tortoise stretches forth its legs and withdraws them again into itself,<br>even so the infinite number of creatures spring from (and enter) these<br>five great fixed essences. Verily, sound springs from Space, and all<br>dense matter is the attribute of earth. Life is from Wind. Taste is from<br>Water. Form is said to be the property of Light. The entire mobile and<br>immobile universe is thus these five great essences existing together in<br>various proportions. When Destruction comes, the infinite diversity of<br>creatures resolve themselves into those five, and once more, when<br>Creation begins, they spring from the same five. The Creator places in<br>all creatures the same five great essences in proportions that He thinks<br>proper. Sound, the ears, and all cavities,&#8212;these three,&#8212;have Space for<br>their producing cause. Taste, all watery or juicy substances, and the<br>tongue, are said to be the properties of water. Form, the eye, and the<br>digestive fire in the stomach, are said to partake of the nature of<br>Light. Scent, the organ of smelling, and the body, are the properties of<br>earth. Life, touch, and action are said to be the properties of Wind. I<br>have thus explained to thee, O king, all the properties of the five<br>primal essences. Having created these, the Supreme Deity, O Bharata,<br>united with them Sattwa, Rajas, Tamas, Time, Consciousness of functions,<br>and Mind forming the sixth.[1443] That which is called the Understanding<br>dwells in the interior of what thou seest above the soles of the feet and<br>below the crown of the head. In man the senses (of knowledge) are five.<br>The sixth (sense) is the Mind. The seventh is called the Understanding.<br>The Kshetrajna or Soul is the eighth. The senses and that which is the<br>Actor should be ascertained by apprehension of their respective<br>functions. The conditions or states called Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas,<br>depend upon the senses for their refuge or formation. The senses exist<br>for simply seizing the impressions of their respective objects. The Mind<br>has doubt for its function. The Understanding is for ascertainment. The<br>Kshetrajna is said to be only an inactive witness (of the functions of<br>the others). Sattwa, Rajas, Tamas, Time, and Acts, O Bharata, these<br>attributes direct the Understanding. The Understanding is the senses and<br>the five fore-mentioned attributes.[1444] When the Understanding is<br>wanting, the senses with the mind, and the five other attributes (viz.,<br>Sattwa, Rajas, Tamas, Time, and Acts) cease to be. That by which the<br>Understanding sees is called the eye. When the Understanding hears, it is<br>called the ear. When she smells, she becomes the sense of scent; and when<br>she tastes the various objects of taste, she comes to be called by the<br>name of tongue. When again she feels the touch of the various objects of<br>touch, she becomes the sense of touch. It is the Understanding that<br>becomes modified diversely and frequently. When the Understanding desires<br>anything, she becomes Mind. The five senses with the Mind, which<br>separately constitute the foundations (of the Understanding), are the<br>creations of the Understanding. They are called Indriyas. When they<br>become stained, the Understanding also becomes stained.[1445] The<br>Understanding, dwelling in Jiva, exists in three states. Sometimes she<br>obtains joy; sometimes she indulges in grief; and sometimes she exists in<br>a state that is neither pleasure nor pain. Having for her essence these<br>conditions or states (viz., Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas), the Understanding<br>resolves through these three states.[1446] As the lord of rivers, viz.,<br>the surging Ocean, always keeps within his continents, even so the<br>Understanding, which exists in connection with the (three) states, exists<br>in the Mind (including the senses). When the state of Rajas is awakened,<br>the Understanding becomes modified into Rajas. Transport of delight, joy,<br>gladness, happiness, and contentedness of heart, these, when somehow<br>excited, are the properties of Sattwa. Heart-burning, grief, sorrow,<br>discontentedness, and unforgivingness,[1447] arising from particular<br>causes, are the result of Rajas. Ignorance, attachment and error,<br>heedlessness, stupefaction, and terror, meanness, cheerlessness, sleep,<br>and procrastination,&#8212;these, when brought about by particular causes, are<br>the properties of Tamas. Whatever state of either body or mind, connected<br>with joy or happiness, arises, should be regarded as due to the state of<br>Sattwa. Whatever, again, is fraught with sorrow and is disagreeable to<br>oneself should be regarded as arising from Rajas. Without commencing any<br>such act, one should turn one's attention to it (for avoiding it).<br>Whatever is fraught with error or stupefaction in either body or mind,<br>and is inconceivable and mysterious, should be known as connected with<br>Tamas. Thus, have I explained to thee that things in this world dwell in<br>the Understanding. By knowing this one becomes wise. What else can be the<br>indication of wisdom? Know now the difference between these two subtile<br>things, viz., Understanding and Soul. One of these, viz., the<br>Understanding, creates attributes. The other, viz., the Soul, does not<br>create them. Although they are, by nature, distinct from each other, yet<br>they always exist in a state of union. A fish is different from the water<br>in which it dwells, but the fish and the water must exist together. The<br>attributes cannot know the Soul. The Soul, however, knows them. They that<br>are ignorant regard the Soul as existing in a state of union with the<br>attributes like qualities existing with their possessors. This, however,<br>is not the case, for the Soul is truly only an inactive Witness of<br>everything. The Understanding has no refuge.[1448] That which is called<br>life (involving the existence of the Understanding) arises from the<br>effects of the attributes coming together. Others (than these attributes<br>which are created by the Understanding), acting as causes, create the<br>Understanding that dwells in the body. No one can apprehend the<br>attributes in their real nature or form of existence. The Understanding,<br>as already said, creates the attributes. The Soul simply beholds them (as<br>an inactive Witness). This union that exists between the Understanding<br>and the Soul is eternal. The indwelling Understanding apprehends all<br>things through the Senses which are themselves inanimate and<br>unapprehending. Really the senses are only like lamps (that throw their<br>light for discovering objects to others without themselves being able to<br>see them). Even this is the nature (of the Senses, the Understanding, and<br>the Soul). Knowing this, one should live cheerfully, without yielding to<br>either grief or joy. Such a man is said to be beyond the influence of<br>pride. That the Understanding creates all these attributes is due to her<br>own nature,&#8212;even as a spider weaves threads in consequence of her own<br>nature. These attributes should be known as the threads the spider<br>weaves. When destroyed, the attributes do not cease to exist; their<br>existence ceases to be visible. When, however, a thing transcends the ken<br>of the senses, its existence (or otherwise) is affirmed by inference.<br>This is the opinion of one set of persons. Others affirm that with<br>destruction the attributes cease to be. Untying this knotty problem<br>addressed to the understanding and reflection, and dispelling all doubt,<br>one should cast off sorrow and live in happiness.[1449] As men<br>unacquainted with its bottom become distressed when they fall upon this<br>earth which is like a river filled with the waters of stupefaction, even<br>so is that man afflicted who falls away from that state in which there is<br>a union with the Understanding.[1450] Men of knowledge, however,<br>conversant with Adhyatma and armed with fortitude, are never afflicted,<br>because they are capable of crossing to the other shore of those waters.<br>Indeed, Knowledge is an efficient raft (in that river). Men of knowledge<br>have not to encounter those frightful terrors which alarm them that are<br>destitute of knowledge. As regards the righteous, none of them attains to<br>an end that is superior to that of any other person amongst them. Indeed,<br>the righteous show, in this respect, an equality. As regards the man of<br>Knowledge, whatever acts have been done by him in past times (while he<br>was steeped in Ignorance) and whatever acts fraught with great iniquity<br>he does (after attainment of Knowledge), he destroys both by Knowledge as<br>his sole means. Then again, upon the attainment of Knowledge he ceases to<br>perpetrate these two evils, viz., censuring the wicked acts of others and<br>doing any wicked acts himself under the influence of attachment.'"[1451]
