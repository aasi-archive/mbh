                            "Suka said, 'The declarations of the Vedas are twofold. They once Jay<br>down the command, 'Do all acts.' They also indicate (the reverse,<br>saying), 'Give up acts.' I ask, 'Whither do persons go by the aid of<br>Knowledge and whither by the aid of acts?'[979] I desire to hear this. Do<br>tell me this. Indeed, these declarations about knowledge and acts are<br>dissimilar and even contradictory.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed, the son of Parasara said these words<br>unto his son, 'I shall expound to thee the two paths, viz., the<br>destructible and the indestructible, depending respectively upon acts and<br>knowledge. Listen with concentrated attention, O child, to me, as I tell<br>thee the place that is reached by one with the aid of knowledge, and that<br>other place which is reached with the aid of acts. The difference between<br>these two places is as great as the limitless sky. The question that thou<br>hast asked me has given me such pain as an atheistic discourse gives to a<br>man of faith. These are the two paths upon which the Vedas are<br>established; the duties (acts) indicated by Pravritti, and those based on<br>Nivritti that have been treated of so excellently.[980] By acts, a living<br>creature is destroyed. By knowledge, however, he becomes emancipated. For<br>this reason, Yogins who behold the other side of the ocean of life never<br>betake themselves to acts. Through acts one is forced to take rebirth,<br>after death, with a body composed of the six and ten ingredients. Through<br>knowledge, however, one becomes transformed into that which is Eternal,<br>Unmanifest, and Immutable. One class of persons that are however of<br>little intelligence, applaud acts. In consequence of this they have to<br>assume bodies (one after another) ceaselessly. Those men whose<br>perceptions are keen in respect of duties and who have attained to that<br>high understanding (which leads to knowledge), never applaud acts even as<br>persons that depend for their drinking water upon the supply of streams<br>never applaud wells and tanks. The fruit that one obtains of acts<br>consists of pleasure and pain, of existence and non-existence. By<br>knowledge, one attains to that whither there is no occasion for grief;<br>whither one becomes freed from both birth and death; whither one is not<br>subject to decrepitude; whither one transcends the state of conscious<br>existence.[981] whither is Brahma which is Supreme, Unmanifest,<br>immutable, ever-existent, imperceptible, above the reach of pain,<br>immortal, and transcending destruction; whither all become freed from the<br>influence of all pairs of opposites (Like pleasure and pain, etc.), as<br>also of wish or purpose.[982] Reaching that stage, they cast equal eyes<br>on everything, become universal friends and devoted to the good of all<br>creatures. There is a wide gulf, O son, between one devoted to knowledge<br>and one devoted to acts. Know that the man of knowledge, without<br>undergoing destruction, remains existent for ever like the moon on the<br>last day of the dark fortnight existing in a subtle (but undestroyed)<br>form. The great Rishi (Yajnavalkya in Vrihadaranayaka) has said this more<br>elaborately. As regards the man devoted to acts, his nature may be<br>inferred from beholding the new-born moon which appears like a bent<br>thread in the firmament.[983] Know, O son, that the person of acts takes<br>rebirth with a body with eleven entities, for its ingredients, that are<br>the results of modification, and with a subtile form that represents a<br>total of six and ten.[984] The deity who takes refuge in that (material)<br>form, like a drop of water on a lotus leaf, should be known as Kshetrajna<br>(Soul), which is Eternal, and which succeeds by Yoga in transcending both<br>the mind and the knowledge.[985] Tamas, Rajas, and Sattwa are the<br>attributes of the knowledge. The knowledge is the attribute of the<br>individual soul residing within the body. The individual soul, in its<br>turn, comes from the Supreme Soul.[986] The body with the soul is said to<br>be the attribute of jiva. It is jiva that acts and cause all bodies to<br>live. He who has created the seven worlds is said by those that are<br>acquainted with what is Kshetra (and what is Kshetrajna) to be above<br>jiva.'"
