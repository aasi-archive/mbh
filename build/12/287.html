                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Living creatures always stand in fear of sorrow and<br>death. Tell me, O grandsire, how the occurrence of these two may be<br>prevented.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection, O Bharata, is cited the old narrative<br>of the discourse between Narada and Samanga.'<br><br>"Narada said, '(While others salute their superiors by only a bend of the<br>head) thou salutest thy superiors by prostrating thyself on the ground<br>till thy chest comes into contact with the ground. Thou seemest to be<br>engaged in crossing (the river of life) with thy hands.[1452] Thou<br>seemest to be always free from sorrow and exceedingly cheerful. I do not<br>see that thou hast the least anxiety. Thou art always content and happy<br>and thou seemest to sport (in felicity) like a child.'<br><br>"Samanga said, 'O giver of honours, I know the truth about the Past, the<br>Present, and the Future. Hence I never become cheerless.[1453] I know<br>also what the beginning of acts is in this world, what the accession of<br>their fruits, and how varied are those fruits. Hence I never yield to<br>sorrow.[1454] Behold, the illiterate, the destitute, the prosperous, O<br>Narada, the blind, idiots and madmen, and ourselves also, all live.[1455]<br>These live by virtue of their acts of past lives. The very deities, who<br>exist freed from diseases, exist (in that state) by virtue of their past<br>acts. The strong and the weak, all, live by virtue of past acts. It is<br>fitting, therefore, that thou shouldst hold us in esteem. The owners of<br>thousands live. The owners of hundreds also live. They that are<br>overwhelmed with sorrow live. Behold, we too are living! When we, O<br>Narada, do not give way to grief, what can the practice of the duties (of<br>religion) or the observance of (religious) acts do to us? And since all<br>joys and sorrows also are not unending, they are, therefore, unable to<br>agitate us at all.[1456] That for which men are said to be wise, indeed,<br>the very root of wisdom, is the freedom of the senses from error. It is<br>the senses that yield to error and grief. One whose senses are subject to<br>error can never be said to have attained wisdom. That pride which is<br>indulged in by a man subject to error is only a form of the error to<br>which he is subject. As regards the man of error, he has neither this<br>world nor the next. It should be remembered that griefs do not last for<br>ever and that happiness cannot be had always.[1457] Worldly life with all<br>its vicissitudes and painful incidents, one like me would never adopt.<br>Such a one would not care for desirable objects of enjoyments, and would<br>not think at all of the happiness their possession may bring about, or,<br>indeed, of the griefs that present themselves.[1458] One capable of<br>resting on one's own self would never covet the possessions of others;<br>would not think of gains unacquired, would not feel delighted at the<br>acquisition of even immense wealth; and would not yield to sorrow at the<br>loss of wealth. Neither friends, nor wealth, nor high birth, nor<br>scriptural learning, nor mantras, nor energy, can succeed in rescuing one<br>from sorrow in the next world. It is only by conduct that one can attain<br>to felicity there. The Understanding of the man unconversant with Yoga<br>can never be directed towards Emancipation. One unconversant with Yoga<br>can never have happiness. Patience and the resolution to cast off sorrow,<br>these two indicate the advent of happiness. Anything agreeable leads to<br>pleasure. Pleasure induces pride. Pride, again, is productive of sorrow.<br>For these reasons, I avoid all these. Grief, Fear, Pride,&#8212;these that<br>stupefy the heart,&#8212;and also Pleasure and Pain, I behold as (an<br>unconcerned) witness since my body is endued with life and moves<br>about.[1459] Casting off both wealth and pleasure, and thirst and error,<br>I wander over the earth, freed from grief and every kind of anxiety of<br>heart. Like one that has drunk nectar I have no fear, here or hereafter,<br>of death, or iniquity, or cupidity, or anything of that kind. I have<br>acquired this knowledge, O Brahmana, as the result of my severe and<br>indestructible penances. It is for this reason, O Narada, that grief,<br>even when it comes to me, does not succeed in afflicting me.'"
