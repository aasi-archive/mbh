                            'Brahma said,&#8212;'Listen, O son, as to how that Purusha is indicated. He is<br>eternal and immutable. He is undeteriorating and immeasurable. He<br>pervades all things.[1918] O best of all creatures, that Purusha cannot<br>be seen by thee, or me, or others. Those that are endued with the<br>understanding and the senses but destitute of self-restraint and<br>tranquility of soul cannot obtain a sight of him. The Supreme Purusha is<br>said to be one that can be seen with the aid of knowledge alone. Though<br>divested of body, He dwells in every body. Though dwelling, again, in<br>bodies, He is never touched by the acts accomplished by those bodies. He<br>is my Antaratma (inner soul). He is thy inner soul. He is the all-seeing<br>Witness dwelling within all embodied creatures and engaged in marking<br>their acts. No one can grasp or comprehend him at any time. The universe<br>is the crown of his head. The universe is his arms. The universe is his<br>feet. The universe is his eyes. The universe is his nose. Alone and<br>single, he roves through all Kshetras (Bodies) unrestrained by any<br>limitations on his will and as he likes. Kshetra is another name for<br>body. And because he knows all Kshetras as also all good and bad deeds,<br>therefore he, who is the soul of Yoga, is called by the name of<br>Kshetrajna.[1919] No one succeeds in perceiving how he enters into<br>embodied creatures and how he goes out of them. Agreeably to the Sankhya<br>mode, as also with the aid of Yoga and the due observance of the<br>ordinances prescribed by it, I am engaged in thinking of the cause of<br>that Purusha, but alas, I am unable to comprehend that cause, excellent<br>as it is. I shall, however, according to the measure of my knowledge,<br>discourse to thee upon that eternal Purusha and his Oneness and supreme<br>greatness. The learned speak of him as the one Purusha. That one eternal<br>Being deserves the appellation of Mahapurusha (the great supreme<br>Purusha). Fire is an element, but it may be seen to blaze up in a<br>thousand places under thousand different circumstances. The Sun is one<br>and single, but his rays extend over the wide universe. Penances are of<br>diverse kinds, but they have one common origin whence they have flowed.<br>The Wind is one, but it blows in diverse forms in the world. The great<br>Ocean is the one parent of all the waters in the world seen under diverse<br>circumstances. Divested of attributes, that one Purusha is the universe<br>displayed in infinitude. Flowing from him, the infinite universe enters<br>into that one Purusha again who transcends all attributes, when the time<br>of its destruction comes. By casting off the consciousness of body and<br>the senses, by casting off all acts good and bad, by casting off both<br>truth and falsehood, one succeeds in divesting oneself of attributes. The<br>person who realises that inconceivable Purusha and comprehends his<br>subtile existence in the quadruple form of Aniruddha, Pradyumna,<br>Sankarshana, and Vasudeva, and who, in consequence of such comprehension,<br>attains to perfect tranquillity of heart, succeeds in entering into and<br>identifying himself with that one auspicious Purusha. Some persons<br>possessed of learning speak of him as the supreme soul. Others regarded<br>him as the one soul. A third class of learned men describe him as the<br>soul.[1920] The truth is that he who is the Supreme Soul is always<br>divested of attributes. He is Narayana. He is the universal soul, and he<br>is the one Purusha. He is never affected by the fruits of acts even as<br>the leaf of the lotus is never drenched by the water one may throw upon<br>it. The Karamta (acting Soul) is different. That Soul is sometimes<br>engaged in acts and when it succeeds in casting off acts attains to<br>Emancipation or identity with the Supreme Soul. The acting Soul is endued<br>with the seven and ten possessions.[1921] Thus it is said that there are<br>innumerable kinds of Purushas in due order. In reality, however, there is<br>but one Purusha. He is the abode of all the ordinances in respect of the<br>universe. He is the highest object of knowledge. He is at once the knower<br>and the object to be known. He is at once the thinker and the object of<br>thought. He is the eater and the food that is eaten. He is the smeller<br>and the scent that is smelled. He is at once he that touches and the<br>object that is touched. He is the agent that sees and the object that is<br>seen. He is the hearer and the object that is heard. He is the conceiver<br>and the object that is conceived. He is possessed of attributes and is<br>free from them. What has previously, O son, been named Pradhana, and is<br>the mother of the Mahat tattwa is no other than the Effulgence of the<br>Supreme Soul; because He it is who is eternal, without destruction and<br>any end and ever immutable. He it is who creates the prime ordinance in<br>respect of Dhatri himself. Learned Brahmanas call Him by the name of<br>Aniruddha. Whatever acts, possessed of excellent merits and fraught with<br>blessings, flow in the world from the Vedas, have been caused by<br>Him.[1922] All the deities and all the Rishis, possessed of tranquil<br>souls, occupying their places on the altar, dedicate to him the first<br>share of their sacrificial offerings.[1923] I, that am Brahma, the<br>primeval master of all creatures, have started into birth from Him, and<br>thou hast taken thy birth from me. From me have flowed the universe with<br>all its mobile and immobile creatures, and all the Vedas, O son, with<br>their mysteries. Divided into four portions (viz., Aniruddha, Pradyumna,<br>Sankarshana, and Vasudeva), He sports as He pleases. That illustrious and<br>divine Lord is even such, awakened by His own knowledge. I have thus<br>answered thee, O son, according to thy questions, and according to the<br>way in which the matter is expounded in the Sankha system and the Yoga<br>philosophy."
