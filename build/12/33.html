                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Sons and grandsons and brothers and sires and<br>fathers-in-law and preceptors and maternal uncles and grandsires, many<br>high-souled Kshatriyas, many relatives (by marriage), friends,<br>companions, sister's sons, and kinsmen, O grandsire, and many foremost of<br>men coming from diverse countries, have fallen. All these, O grandsire,<br>have been caused to be slain by myself alone, from desire of kingdom.<br>Having caused so many heroic kings who were always devoted to<br>righteousness and all of whom had quaffed Soma in sacrifices, what end<br>shall I attain, O great ascetic! Thinking that this earth has been bereft<br>of many lions among kings, all of whom were in the enjoyment of great<br>prosperity, I burn continually to this day. Having witnessed this<br>slaughter of kinsmen and millions of other men, I burn with grief, O<br>grandsire! Oh, what will be the plight of those foremost of ladies who<br>have been deprived of sons, of husbands, and of brothers. Reproaching the<br>Pandavas and the Vrishnis as cruel murderers, those ladies, with<br>emaciated features and plunged in grief, will throw themselves on the<br>earth! Not beholding their sires and brothers and husbands and sons,<br>those ladies, through affliction, casting off their life-breath, will go<br>to the abode of Yama, O foremost of Brahmanas! I have no doubt of this.<br>The course of morality is very subtle. It is plain that we shall be<br>stained with the guilt of slaughtering women for this. Having slain our<br>kinsmen and friends and thereby committed an inexpiable sin, we shall<br>have to fall into hell with heads downwards. O best of men, we shall,<br>therefore, waste our limbs with the austerest of penances. Tell me, O<br>grandsire, to what mode of life I should betake myself then.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Hearing these words of Yudhishthira, the<br>Island-born Rishi, having reflected keenly for some time, addressed the<br>son of Pandu as follows:<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'Remembering the duties of a Kshatriya, O king, do not give<br>way to grief. All those Kshatriyas, O bull among Kshatriyas, have fallen<br>in the observance of their proper duties. In the pursuit of great<br>prosperity and of great fame on earth, those foremost of men, all of whom<br>were liable to death,[109] have perished through the influence of Time.<br>Thou hast not been their slayer, nor this Bhima, nor Arjuna, nor the<br>twins. It is Time that took away their life-breaths according to the<br>great law of change. Time hath neither mother, nor father, nor anybody<br>for whom he is disposed to show any favour. He is the witness of the acts<br>of all creatures. By him have they been taken away. This battle, O bull<br>of Bharata's race, was only an occasion ordained by him. He causes<br>creatures to be slain through the instrumentality of creatures. This is<br>the manner in which it puts forth its irresistible power. Know that Time<br>(in his dealings with creatures) is dependent upon the bond of action and<br>is the witness of all actions good and bad. It is Time that brings about<br>the fruits, fraught with bliss or woe, of our actions. Think, O<br>mighty-armed one, of the acts of those Kshatriyas that have fallen. Those<br>acts were the causes of their destruction and it is in consequence of<br>them that they have perished. Think also of thy own acts consisting of<br>observances of vows with restrained soul. And think also how thou hast<br>been forced by the Supreme Ordainer to do such an act (as the slaughter<br>of so many human beings). As a weapon made by a smith or carpenter is<br>under the control of the person that is handling it, and moves as he<br>moves it, similarly this universe, controlled by actions done in Time,<br>moves as those actions move it. Seeing that the births and deaths of<br>creatures take place without any (assignable) cause and in perfect<br>wantonness, grief and joy are perfectly needless. Although this<br>entanglement of thy heart is a mere delusion, still, if it pleaseth thee,<br>O king, perform expiatory rites (for washing thyself free of thy<br>so-called sin). It is heard, O Partha, that the gods and the Asuras<br>fought against each other. The Asuras were the elder, and the gods the<br>younger brothers. Covetous of prosperity, fierce was the battle fought<br>between them. The fight lasted for two and thirty thousand years. Making<br>the earth one vast expanse of blood, the gods slew the Daityas and gained<br>possession of heaven. Having obtained possession of the earth, a (large)<br>number of Brahmanas, conversant with the Vedas, armed themselves,<br>stupefied with pride, with the Danavas for giving them help in the fight.<br>They were known by the name of Salavrika and numbered eight and eighty<br>thousand. All of them, however, were slain by the gods. Those<br>wicked-souled persons who desire the extinction of virtue and who set<br>sinfulness agoing deserve to be slain even as the furious Daityas were<br>slain by the gods. If by slaying a single individual a family may be<br>saved, or, if by slaying a single family the whole kingdom may be saved,<br>such an act of slaughter will not be a transgression. Sin, O king,<br>sometimes assumes the form of virtue, and virtue sometimes assumes the<br>form of sin. They, however, that are learned, know which is which.<br>Therefore, console thyself, O son of Pandu, for thou art well versed in<br>the scriptures. Thou hast, O Bharata, only followed the path formerly<br>trodden by the very gods. Men like yourselves never go to hell, O bull of<br>Pandu's race! Comfort these thy brothers and all thy friends, O scorcher<br>of foes! He who deliberately engages himself in sinful acts, and<br>committing sinful acts feels no shame but continues the same as before,<br>is called (in the scripture) a great sinner. There is no expiation for<br>him and his sins know no diminution. Thou art born in noble race. Forced<br>by the faults of others, thou hast most unwillingly done this, and having<br>done this thou repentest of it. The Horse-sacrifice, that grand rite, has<br>been indicated as an expiation for thee. Make preparations for that<br>sacrifice, O monarch, and thou shalt be freed from thy sins. The divine<br>chastiser of Paka, having vanquished his foes with the assistance of the<br>Maruts, gradually performed a hundred sacrifices and became<br>Satakratu.[110] Freed from sin, possessed of heaven, and having obtained<br>many regions of bliss and great happiness and prosperity, Sakra,<br>surrounded by the Maruts, is shining in beauty, and illuminating all the<br>quarters with his splendour. The lord of Sachi is adored in the heavens<br>by the Apsaras. The Rishis and the other gods all worship him with<br>reverence. Thou hast got the earth through thy prowess. All the kings<br>have been vanquished by thee, O sinless one, through thy prowess.<br>Proceeding with thy friends to their kingdom, O king, install their<br>brothers, sons, or grandsons on their thrones. Behaving with kindness<br>towards even the children in the womb, make thy subjects glad and happy,<br>and rule the earth. Install on their thrones the daughters of those that<br>have no sons. Women are fond of pleasure and power. Through this means<br>they will castoff their sorrows and become happy. Having comforted the<br>whole empire in this way, O Bharata, adore the gods in a Horse-sacrifice<br>as the virtuous Indra did in days of old. It is not proper for us to<br>grieve for those high-souled Kshatriyas, O bull of thy order (that have<br>fallen in battle). Stupefied by the power of the destroyer, they have<br>perished in the observance of the duties of their own order. Thou hast<br>discharged the duties of a Kshatriya and obtained the earth without a<br>thorn in it. Observe thy own duties, O son of Kunti, for then, O Bharata,<br>thou shalt be able to obtain happiness in the other world.'"
