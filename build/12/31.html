                            Vaisampayana said, "The royal son of Pandu then addressed Narada, saying,<br>'O holy one, I desire to hear of the birth of the child whose excreta<br>were gold.' Thus addressed by king Yudhishthira the just, the sage Narada<br>began to narrate to him all that had occurred in connection with that<br>child of golden excreta.<br><br>"Narada said, 'It is even so, O thou of mighty arms, as Kesava here hath<br>said. Asked by thee I shall now recite the portion that remains of this<br>story. Myself, and my sister's son, the great ascetic Parvata, came (on<br>one occasion) unto Srinjaya that foremost of all victorious kings, for<br>dwelling with him. Honoured by him with due rites, and with every wish of<br>ours gratified, we took up our residence in his abode. After the season<br>of rains had gone, and when the time came for our own departure, Parvata<br>said unto me those words of grave import suitable to the hour: 'We have,<br>O Brahmana, dwelt in the abode of this king for some time, highly<br>honoured by him. Think of what return we should make.' I then, O monarch,<br>addressed Parvata of blessed aspect, saying, 'O nephew, this becomes<br>thee, and, O thou of great power, all this depends upon thyself. Through<br>thy boons let the king be made happy and let him obtain his wishes. Or,<br>if thou choosest, let him be crowned with success through the ascetic<br>merits of both of us.' After this, Parvata having called king Srinjaya,<br>that foremost of victorious persons, said unto him these words O bull of<br>Kuru's race, 'We have been exceedingly gratified, O king, with thy<br>hospitable attentions given to us with every sincerity. With our<br>permission, O foremost of men, think of the boon thou shouldst solicit.<br>Let the boon, however, be such that it may not imply enmity to the gods<br>or destruction to men! Accept then, O king, a boon, for thou deservest<br>one as we think.' Hearing these words, Srinjaya replied, 'If ye have been<br>gratified with me, my object then has been gained, for that of itself has<br>been my greatest gain and that is regarded by me as the fruition of all<br>my desire.' Unto Srinjaya who said so, Parvata again said, 'Solicit, O<br>king, the fruition of that wish which thou art cherishing in thy heart,<br>for a long time.' Srinjaya answered, 'I desire a son that shall be heroic<br>and possessed of great energy, firm in his vows and of long life, highly<br>blessed and possessed of splendour equal to that of the Chief himself of<br>the deities.' At this, Parvata said, 'This thy desire shall be fulfilled.<br>Thy child, however, shall not be long-lived, for thy wish for such a son<br>is even for prevailing over the Chief of the gods. Thy son shall be known<br>by the name of Suvarnashthivin. He shall be possessed of splendour like<br>that of the Chief of the gods but take care to protect him always from<br>that deity.' Hearing these words of the high-souled Parvata, Srinjaya<br>began to beseech that saint for ordaining otherwise, saying, 'Let my son<br>be long-lived, O Muni, through thy ascetic merit.' Parvata, however, said<br>nothing, through partiality for Indra. Beholding the king very cheerless,<br>I said unto him, 'Think of me, O king, (in thy distress), and I shall<br>promise to come when thought of by thee. Do not grieve, O lord of earth!<br>I will give thee back thy beloved child, even if he be dead, in his<br>living form.' Having said so unto that monarch, both of us left his<br>presence for coming to where we wished, and Srinjaya returned to his<br>abode as he pleased. After some time had elapsed, the royal sage Srinjaya<br>had born unto him a son of great prowess and blazing forth with energy.<br>The child grew up like a large lotus in a lake, and became<br>Suvarnashthivin in reality as in name. This extraordinary fact, O best of<br>the Kurus, soon became widely known over the world. The Chief of the gods<br>also came to know it as the result of Parvata's boon. Fearing humiliation<br>(at the hands of the child when he would grow up), the slayer of Vala and<br>Vritra began to watch for the laches of the prince. He commanded his<br>celestial weapon Thunder, standing before him in embodied shape, saying,<br>'Go, O puissant one, and assuming the form of a tiger slay this prince.<br>When grown up, this child of Srinjaya may, by his achievements, humiliate<br>me, O Thunder, as Parvata said.' Thus addressed by Sakra, the celestial<br>weapon Thunder, that subjugator of hostile towns, began from that day to<br>continually watch for the laches of the prince. Srinjaya, meanwhile,<br>having obtained that child whose splendour resembled that of Indra<br>himself, became filled with joy. The king, accompanied by his wives, and<br>the other ladies of his household, took up his residence in the midst of<br>a forest. One day, on the shores of the Bhagirathi, the boy, accompanied<br>by his nurse, ran hither and thither in play. Though only five years of<br>age, his prowess, even then, resembled that of a mighty elephant. While<br>thus employed, the child met a powerful tiger that came upon him<br>suddenly. The infant prince trembled violently as he was being crushed by<br>the tiger and soon fell down lifeless on the earth. At this sight the<br>nurse uttered loud cries of grief. Having slain the prince, the tiger,<br>through Indra's powers of delusion, vanished there and then. Hearing the<br>voice of the crying nurse, the king, in great anxiety, ran to the spot.<br>He beheld his son there, his blood quaffed off, and lying lifeless on the<br>ground like the moon dropped from the firmament. Taking up on his lap the<br>boy covered with blood, the king, with heart stricken by grief, began to<br>lament piteously. The royal ladies then, afflicted with grief and crying,<br>quickly ran to the spot where king Srinjaya was. In that situation the<br>king thought of me with concentrated attention. Knowing that the king was<br>thinking of me I appeared before him. Stricken with grief as the king<br>was, I recited to him all those stories, O monarch, that hero of Yadu's<br>race has already recited to thee. I brought Srinjaya's child back to<br>life, with Indra's permission. That which is ordained must occur. It is<br>impossible that it should be otherwise. After this, prince<br>Suvarnashthivin of great fame and energy began to delight the hearts of<br>his parents. Of great prowess, he ascended the throne of his father after<br>the latter had repaired to heaven, and ruled for a period of one thousand<br>and one hundred years. He worshipped the gods in many great sacrifices<br>characterised by profuse presents. Possessed of great splendour, he<br>gratified the gods and the Pitris. Having procreated many sons, all of<br>whom by their issues multiplied the race, he went the way of all nature,<br>O king, after many years. Do thou, O foremost of kings dispel this grief<br>born in thy heart, even as Kesava has counselled thee, as also Vyasa of<br>austere penances. Rise up, O king, and bear the burthen of this thy<br>ancestral kingdom, and perform high and great sacrifices so that thou<br>mayst obtain (hereafter) whatever regions may be desired by thee!'"
