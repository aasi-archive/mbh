                            "Bhishma said, 'From the attribute of Passion arises delusion or loss of<br>judgment. From the attribute of Darkness, O bull of Bharata's race, arise<br>wrath and cupidity and fear and pride. When all these are destroyed, one<br>becomes pure. By obtaining purity, a person succeeds in arriving at the<br>knowledge of the Supreme Soul which is resplendent with effulgence,<br>incapable of deterioration, without change, pervading all things, having<br>the unmanifest for his refuge, and the foremost of all the deities.<br>Invested in His maya, men fall away from knowledge and become senseless,<br>and in consequence of their knowledge being darkened, yield to<br>wrath.[736] From wrath, they become subject to desire. From desire spring<br>cupidity and delusion and vanity and pride and selfishness. From such<br>selfishness proceeds various kinds of acts.[737] From acts spring diverse<br>bonds of affection and from those bonds of affection spring sorrow or<br>misery and from acts fraught with joy and sorrow proceeds the liability<br>to birth and death.[738] In consequence of the obligation of birth, the<br>liability is incurred of a residence within the womb, due to the union of<br>vital seed and blood. That residence is defiled with excreta and urine<br>and phlegm, and always fouled with blood that is generated there.<br>Overwhelmed by thirst, the Chit-Soul becomes bound by wrath and the rest<br>that have been enumerated above. It seeks, however, to escape those<br>evils. In respect of this, women must be regarded as instruments which<br>set the stream of Creation agoing. By their nature, women are Kshetra,<br>and men are Kshetrajna in respect of attributes. For this reason, persons<br>of wisdom should not pursue women in especial (among other objects of the<br>world).[739] Indeed, women are like frightful mantra-powers. They stupefy<br>persons reft of wisdom. They are sunk in the attribute of Passion. They<br>are the eternal embodiment of the senses.[740] In consequence of the keen<br>desire that men entertain for women, off-spring proceed from them, due to<br>(the action of) the vital seed. As one casts off from one's body such<br>vermin as take their birth there but as are not on that account any part<br>of oneself, even so should one cast off those vermin of one's body that<br>are called children, who, though regarded as one's own, are not one's own<br>in reality. From the vital seed as from sweat (and other filth) creatures<br>spring from the body, influenced by the acts of previous lives or in the<br>course of nature. Therefore, one possessed of wisdom should feel no<br>regard for them.[741] The attribute of Passion rests on that of Darkness.<br>The attribute of Goodness, again, rests on that of Passion. Darkness<br>which is unmanifest overspreads itself on Knowledge, and causes the<br>phenomena of Intelligence and Consciousness.[742] That knowledge<br>possessing the attributes of Intelligence and Consciousness has been said<br>to be the seed of embodied Souls. That, again, which is the seed of such<br>knowledge is called the Jiva (or Chit-Soul).[743] In consequence of acts<br>and the virtue of time, the Soul goes through birth and repeated rounds<br>of rebirth. As in a dream the Soul sports as if invested with a body<br>which, of course, is due to the action of the mind, after the same<br>manner, it obtains in the mother's womb a body in consequence of<br>attributes and propensities having (past) acts for their origin. Whatever<br>senses while it is there, are awakened by past acts as the operating<br>cause, become generated in Consciousness in consequence of the mind<br>co-existing with attachments.[744] In consequence of the past thoughts of<br>sound that are awakened in it, the Soul, subjected to such influences,<br>receives the organ of hearing. Similarly, from attachment to forms, its<br>eye is produced, and from its longing after scent its organ of smelling.<br>From thoughts of touch it acquires the skin. In the same way the<br>five-fold breaths are acquired by it, viz., Prana, Apana, Vyana, Udana,<br>and Samana, which contribute to keep the body agoing. Encased in body<br>with all limbs fully developed in consequence (as shown above) of past<br>acts, the Soul takes birth, with sorrow, both physical and mental, in the<br>beginning, middle, and end. It should be known that sorrow springs from<br>the very fact of acceptance of body (in the womb). It increases with the<br>idea of Self. From renunciation of these (attachments which are the cause<br>of birth), sorrow meets with an end. He that is conversant with sorrow's<br>end attains to Emancipation.[745] Both the origin and the destruction of<br>the senses rest in the attribute of Passion. The man of wisdom should act<br>with proper scrutiny with the aid of the eye constituted by the<br>scriptures.[746] The senses of knowledge, even if they succeed in earning<br>all their objects, never succeed in overwhelming the man that is without<br>thirst. The embodied Soul, by making its senses weak, escapes the<br>obligation or rebirth.'"[747]
