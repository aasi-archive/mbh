                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast laid it down, O mighty one, that no trust<br>should be placed upon foes. But how would the king maintain himself if he<br>were not to trust anybody? From trust, O king, thou hast said, great<br>danger arises to kings. But how, O monarch, can a king, without trusting<br>others, conquer his foes? Kindly remove this doubt of mine. My mind has<br>become confused, O grandsire, at what I have heard thee say on the<br>subject of mistrust.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O king, to what happened at the abode of<br>Brahmadatta, viz., the conversation between Pujani and king Brahmadatta.<br>There was a bird named Pujani who lived for a long time with king<br>Brahmadatta in the inner apartments of his palace at Kampilya. Like the<br>bird Jivajivaka, Pujani could mimic the cries of all animals. Though a<br>bird by birth, she had great knowledge and was conversant with every<br>truth. While living there, she brought forth an offspring of great<br>splendour. At the very same time the king also got by his queen a son.<br>Pujani, who was grateful for the shelter of the king's roof, used every<br>day to go to the shores of the ocean and bring a couple of fruits for the<br>nourishment of her own young one and the infant prince. One of those<br>fruits she gave to her own child and the other she gave to the prince.<br>The fruits she brought were sweet as nectar, and capable of increasing<br>strength and energy. Every day she brought them and everyday she disposed<br>of them in the same way. The infant prince derived great strength from<br>the fruit of Pujani's giving that he ate. One day the infant prince,<br>while borne on the arms of his nurse, saw the little offspring of Pujani.<br>Getting down from the nurse's arms, the child ran towards the bird, and<br>moved by childish impulse, began to Play with it, relishing the sport<br>highly. At length, raising the bird which was of the same age with<br>himself in his hands, the prince pressed out its young life and then came<br>back to his nurse. The dam, O king, who had been out in her search after<br>the accustomed fruits, returning to the palace, beheld her young one<br>lying on the ground, killed by the prince. Beholding her son deprived of<br>life, Pujani, with tears gushing down her cheeks, and heart burning with<br>grief, wept bitterly and said, 'Alas, nobody should live with a Kshatriya<br>or make friends with him or take delight in any intercourse with him.<br>When they have any object to serve, they behave with courtesy. When that<br>object has been served they cast off the instrument. The Kshatriyas do<br>evil unto all. They should never be trusted. Even after doing an injury<br>they always seek to soothe and assure the injured for nothing. I shall<br>certainly take due vengeance, for this act of hostility, upon this cruel<br>and ungrateful betrayer of confidence. He has been guilty of a triple sin<br>in taking the life of one that was horn on the same day with him and that<br>was being reared with him in the same place, that used to eat with him,<br>and that was dependent on him for protection.' Having said these words<br>unto herself, Pujani, with her talons, pierced the eyes of the prince,<br>and deriving some comfort from that act of vengeance, once more said, 'A<br>sinful act, perpetrated deliberately, assails the doer without any loss<br>of time. They. on the other hand, who avenge themselves of an injury,<br>never lose their merit by such conduct. If the consequence of a sinful<br>act be not seen in the perpetrator himself, they would certainly be seen,<br>O king, in his sons or son's sons or daughter's sons. Brahmadatta,<br>beholding his son blinded by Pujani and regarding the act to have been a<br>proper vengeance for what his son had done, said these words unto Pujani.'<br><br>"Brahmadatta said, 'An injury was done by us to thee. Thou hast avenged<br>it by doing an injury in return. The account has been squared. Do not<br>leave thy present abode. On the other hand, continue to dwell here, O<br>Pujani.'<br><br>"Pujani said, 'If a person having once injured another continues to<br>reside with that other, they that are possessed of learning never applaud<br>his conduct. Under such circumstances it is always better for the injurer<br>to leave his old place. One should never place one's trust upon the<br>soothing assurances received from an injured party. The fool that trusts<br>such assurances soon meets with destruction. Animosity is not quickly<br>cooled. The very sons and grandsons of persons that have injured each<br>other meet with destruction (in consequence of the quarrel descending<br>like an inheritance). In consequence again of such destruction of their<br>offspring, they lose the next world also. Amongst men that have injured<br>one another, mistrust would be productive of happiness. One that has<br>betrayed confidence should never be trusted in the least. One who is not<br>deserving of trust should not be trusted; nor should too much trust be<br>placed upon a person deserving of trust. The danger that arises from<br>blind confidence brings about a destruction that is complete. One should<br>seek to inspire others with confidence in one's self. One, however,<br>should never repose confidence on others. The father and the mother only<br>are the foremost of friends. The wife is merely a vessel for drawing the<br>seeds. The son is only one's seed. The brother is a foe. The friend or<br>companion requires to have his palms oiled if he is to remain so. One's<br>own self it is that enjoys or suffers one's happiness or misery. Amongst<br>persons that have injured one another, it is not advisable there should<br>be (real) peace. The reasons no longer exists for which I lived here. The<br>mind of a person who has once injured another becomes naturally filled<br>with mistrust, if he sees the injured person worshipping him with gifts<br>and honours. Such conduct, especially when displayed by those that are<br>strong, always fills the weak with alarm. A person possessed of<br>intelligence should leave that place where he first meets with honour in<br>order to meet only with dishonour and injury next. In spite of any<br>subsequent honour that he might obtain from his enemy, he should behave<br>in this way. I have dwelt in thy abode for a longtime, all along honoured<br>by thee. A cause of enmity, however, has at last arisen. I should,<br>therefore, leave this place without any hesitation.'<br><br>"Brahmadatta said, 'One who does an injury in return for an injury<br>received is never regarded as offending. Indeed, the avenger squares his<br>account by such conduct. Therefore, O Pujani, continue to reside here<br>without leaving this place.'<br><br>"Pujani said, 'No friendship can once more be cemented between a person<br>that has injured and him that has inflicted an injury in return. The<br>hearts of neither can forget what has happened.'<br><br>"Brahmadatta said, 'It is necessary that a union should take place<br>between an injurer and the avenger of that injury. Mutual animosity, upon<br>such a union, has been seen to cool. No fresh injury also has followed in<br>such cases.'<br><br>"Pujani said, 'Animosity (springing from mutual injuries) can never die.<br>The person injured should never trust his foes, thinking, 'O, I have been<br>soothed with assurances of goodwill.' In this world, men frequently meet<br>with destruction in consequence of (misplaced) confidence. For this<br>reason it is necessary that we should no longer meet each other. They who<br>cannot be reduced to subjection by the application of even force and<br>sharp weapons, can be conquered by (insincere) conciliation like (wild)<br>elephants through a (tame) she-elephant.'<br><br>"Brahmadatta said, 'From the fact of two persons residing together, even<br>if one inflicts upon the other deadly injury, an affection arises<br>naturally between them, as also mutual trust as in the case, of the<br>Chandala and the dog. Amongst persons that have injured one another,<br>co-residence blunts the keenness of animosity. Indeed, that animosity<br>does not last long, but disappears quickly like water poured upon the<br>leaf of a lotus.'<br><br>"Pujani said, 'Hostility springs from five causes. Persons possessed of<br>learning know it. Those five causes are woman, land, harsh words, natural<br>incompatibility, and injury.[414] When the person with whom hostility<br>occurs happens to be a man of liberality, he should never be slain,<br>particularly by a Kshatriya, openly or by covert means. In such a case,<br>the man's fault should be properly weighed.[415] When hostility has<br>arisen with even a friend, no further confidence should be reposed upon<br>him. Feelings of animosity lie hid like fire in wood. Like the Aurvya<br>fire within the waters of the ocean, the fire of animosity can never be<br>extinguished by gifts of wealth, by display of prowess, by conciliation,<br>or by scriptural learning. The fire of animosity, once ignited, the<br>result of an injury once inflicted, is never extinguished, O king,<br>without consuming out the right one of the parties. One, having injured a<br>person, should never trust him again as one's friend, even though one<br>might have (after the infliction of the injury) worshipped him with<br>wealth and honours. The fact of the injury inflicted fills the injurer<br>with fear. I never injured thee. Thou also didst never do me an injury.<br>For this reason I dwelt in thy abode. All that is changed, and at present<br>I cannot trust thee.'<br><br>"Brahmadatta said, 'It is Time that does every act, Acts are of diverse<br>kinds, and all of them proceed from Time. Who, therefore, injures<br>whom?[416] Birth and Death happen in the same way. Creatures act (i.e.,<br>take birth and live) in consequence of Time, and it is in consequence<br>also of Time that they cease to live. Some are seen to die at once. Some<br>die one at a time. Some are seen to live for long periods. Like fire<br>consuming the fuel, Time consumes all creatures. O blessed lady, I am,<br>therefore, not the cause of your sorrow, nor art thou the cause of mine.<br>It is Time that always ordains the weal and woe of embodied creatures. Do<br>thou then continue to dwell here according to thy pleasure, with<br>affection for me and without fear of any injury from me. What thou hast<br>done has been forgiven by me. Do thou also forgive me, O Pujani!'<br><br>"Pujani said, 'If Time, according to thee, be the cause of all acts, then<br>of course nobody can cherish feelings of animosity towards anybody on<br>earth. I ask, however, why friends and kinsmen, seek to avenge themselves<br>the slain. Why also did the gods and the Asuras in days of your smite<br>each other in battle? If it is Time that causes weal and woe and birth<br>and death, why do physicians, then seek, to administer medicines to the<br>sick? If it is Time that is moulding everything, what need is there of<br>medicines? Why do people, deprived of their senses by grief, indulge in<br>such delirious rhapsodies? If Time, according to thee, be the cause of<br>acts, how can religious merit be acquired by persons performing religious<br>acts? Thy son killed my child. I have injured him for that. I have by<br>that act, O king, become liable to be slain by thee. Moved by grief for<br>my son, I have done this injury to thy son. Listen now to the reason why<br>I have become liable to be killed by thee. Men wish for birds either to<br>kill them for food or to keep them in cages for sport. There is no third<br>reason besides such slaughter or immurement for which men would seek<br>individuals of our species. Birds, again, from fear of being either<br>killed or immured by men seek safety in Right. Persons conversant with<br>the Vedas have said that death and immurement are both painful. Life is<br>dear unto all. All creatures are made miserable by grief and pain. All<br>creatures wish for happiness. Misery arises from various sources.<br>Decrepitude, O Brahmadatta, is misery. The loss of wealth is misery. The<br>adjacence of anything disagreeable or evil is misery. Separation or<br>dissociation from friends and agreeable objects is misery. Misery arises<br>from death and immurement. Misery arises from causes connected with women<br>and from other natural causes. The misery that arises from the death of<br>children alters and afflicts all creatures very greatly. Some foolish<br>persons say that there is no misery in others' misery.[417] Only he who<br>has not felt any misery himself can say so in the midst of men. He,<br>however, that has felt sorrow and misery, would never venture to say so.<br>One that has felt the pangs of every kind of misery feels the misery of<br>others as one's own. What I have done to thee, O king, and what thou has<br>done to me, cannot be washed away by even a hundred years After what we<br>have done to each other, there cannot be a reconciliation. As often as<br>thou wilt happen to think of thy son, thy animosity towards me will<br>become fresh. If a person after avenging oneself of an injury, desires to<br>make peace with the injured, the parties cannot be properly reunited even<br>like the fragments of an earthen vessel. Men conversant with scriptures<br>have laid it down that trust never produces happiness Usanas himself sang<br>two verses unto Prahlada in days of old. He who trusts the words, true or<br>false, of a foe, meets with destruction like a seeker of honey, in a pit<br>covered with dry grass.[418] Animosities are seen to survive the very<br>death of enemies, for persons would speak of the previous quarrels of<br>their deceased sires before their surviving children. Kings extinguish<br>animosities by having recourse to conciliation but, when the opportunity<br>comes, break their foes into pieces like earthen jars full of water<br>dashed upon stone. If the king does injury to any one, he should never<br>trust him again. By trusting a person who has been injured, one has to<br>suffer great misery.<br><br>"Brahmadatta said, 'No man can obtain the fruition of any object by<br>withholding his trust (from others). By cherishing fear one is always<br>obliged to live as a dead person.'<br><br>"Pujani said, 'He whose feet have become sore, certainly meets with a<br>fall if he seeks to move, move he may howsoever cautiously. A man who has<br>got sore eyes, by opening them against the wind, finds them exceedingly<br>pained by the wind. He who, without knowing his own strength, sets foot<br>on a wicked path and persists in walking along it, soon loses his very<br>life as the consequence. The man who, destitute of exertion, tills his<br>land, disregarding the season of rain, never succeeds in obtaining a<br>harvest. He who takes every day food that is nutritive, be it bitter or<br>astringent or palatable or sweet, enjoys a long life. He, on the other<br>hand, who disregards wholesome food and takes that which is injurious<br>without an eye to consequences, soon meets with death. Destiny and<br>Exertion exist, depending upon each other. They that are of high souls<br>achieve good and great feats, while eunuchs only pay court to Destiny. Be<br>it harsh or mild, an act that is beneficial should be done. The<br>unfortunate man of inaction, however, is always overwhelmed by all sorts<br>of calamity. Therefore, abandoning everything else, one should put forth<br>his energy. Indeed, disregarding everything, men should do what is<br>productive of good to themselves. Knowledge, courage, cleverness,<br>strength, and patience are said to be one's natural friends. They that<br>are possessed of wisdom pass their lives in this world with the aid of<br>these five. Houses, precious metals, land, wife, and friends,&#8212;these are<br>said by the learned to be secondary sources of good. A man may obtain<br>them everywhere. A person possessed of wisdom may be delighted<br>everywhere. Such a man shines everywhere. He never inspires anybody with<br>fear. If sought to be frightened, he never yields to fear himself. The<br>wealth, however little, that is possessed at any time by an intelligent<br>man is certain to increase. Such a man does every act with cleverness. In<br>consequence of self-restraint, he succeeds in winning great fame.<br>Home-keeping men of little understanding have to put up with termagant<br>wives that eat up their flesh like the progeny of a crab eating up their<br>dam. There are men who through loss of understanding become very<br>cheerless at the prospect of leaving home. They say unto<br>themselves,&#8212;These are our friends! This is our country! Alas, how shall<br>we leave these?&#8212;One should certainly leave the country of one's birth,<br>if it be afflicted by plague or famine. One should live in one's own<br>country, respected by all, or repair to a foreign country for living<br>there. I shall, for this reason, repair to some other region. I do not<br>venture to live any longer in this place, for I have done a great wrong<br>to thy child, O king, one should from a distance abandon a bad wife, a<br>bad son, a bad king, a bad friend, a bad alliance, and a bad country. One<br>should not place any trust on a bad son. What joy can one have in a bad<br>wife? There cannot be any happiness in a bad kingdom. In a bad country<br>one cannot hope to obtain a livelihood. There can be no lasting<br>companionship with a bad friend whose attachment is very uncertain. In a<br>bad alliance, when there is no necessity for it, there is disgrace. She<br>indeed, is a wife who speaks only what is agreeable. He is a son who<br>makes the sire happy. He is a friend in whom one can trust. That indeed,<br>is one's country where one earns one's living. He is a king of strict<br>rule who does not oppress, who cherishes the poor and in whose<br>territories there is no fear. Wife, country, friends, son, kinsmen, and<br>relatives, all these one can have if the king happens to be possessed of<br>accomplishments and virtuous eyes. If the king happens to be sinful, his<br>subjects, inconsequence of his oppressions, meet with destruction. The<br>king is the root of one's triple aggregate (i.e., Virtue, Wealth, and<br>Pleasure). He should protect his subjects with heedfulness. Taking from<br>his subjects a sixth share of their wealth, he should protect them all.<br>That king who does not protect his subjects is truly a thief. That king<br>who, after giving assurances of protection, does not, from rapacity,<br>fulfil them,&#8212;that ruler of sinful soul,&#8212;takes upon himself the sins of<br>all hi subjects and ultimately sinks into hell. That king, on the other<br>hand, who, having given assurances of protection, fulfils them, comes to<br>be regarded as a universal benefactor in consequence of protecting all<br>his subjects. The lord of all creatures, viz., Manu, has said that the<br>king has seven attributes: he is mother, father, preceptor, protector,<br>fire, Vaisravana and Yama. The king by behaving with compassion towards<br>his people is called their father. The subject that behaves falsely<br>towards him takes birth in his next life as an animal or a bird. By doing<br>good to them and by cherishing the poor, the king becomes a mother unto<br>his people. By scorching the wicked he comes to be regarded as fire, and<br>by restraining the sinful he comes to be called Yama. By making gifts of<br>wealth unto those that are dear to him, the king comes to be regarded as<br>Kuvera, the grantor of wishes. By giving instruction in morality and<br>virtue, he becomes a preceptor, and by exercising the duty of protection<br>he becomes the protector. That king who delights the people of his cities<br>and provinces by means of his accomplishments, is never divested of his<br>kingdom in consequence of such observance of duty. That king who knows<br>how to honour his subjects never suffers misery either here or hereafter.<br>That king whose subjects are always filled with anxiety or overburdened<br>with taxes, and overwhelmed by evils of every kind, meets with defeat at<br>the hands of his enemies. That king, on the other hand, whose subjects<br>grow like a large lotus in a lake succeeds in obtaining every reward here<br>and at last meets with honour in heaven. Hostility with a person that is<br>powerful is, O king, never applauded. That king who has incurred the<br>hostility of one more powerful than himself, loses both kingdom and<br>happiness.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The bird, having said these words, O monarch, unto<br>king Brahmadatta, took the king's leave and proceeded to the region she<br>chose. I have thus recited to thee, O foremost of kings, the discourse<br>between Brahmadatta and Pujani. What else dost thou wish to hear?'
