                            "Vyasa said, 'Brahma is the effulgent seed from which, existing as it<br>does by itself, hath sprung the whole universe consisting of two kinds of<br>being, viz., the mobile and the immobile.[877] At the dawn of His day,<br>waking up. He creates with the help of Avidya this universe. At first<br>springs up that which is called Mahat. That Mahat is speedily transformed<br>into Mind which is the soul of the Manifest.[878] Overwhelming the Chit,<br>which is effulgent, with Avidya, Mind creates seven great beings.[879]<br>Urged by the desire of creating, Mind, which is far-reaching, which has<br>many courses, and which has desire and doubt for its principal<br>indications, begins to create diverse kinds of objects by modifications<br>of itself. First springs from it Space. Know that its property is Sound.<br>From Space, by modification, arises the bearer of all scents, viz., the<br>pure and mighty Wind. It is said to possess the attribute of Touch. From<br>Wind also, by modification, springs Light endued with effulgence.<br>Displayed in beauty, and called also Sukram, it starts into existence,<br>thus, possessing the attribute of Form. From Light, by modification,<br>arises Water having Taste for its attribute. From Water springs Earth<br>having Scent for its attribute. These are said to represent initial<br>creation.[880] These, one after another, acquire the attributes of the<br>immediately preceding ones from which they have sprung. Each has not only<br>its own special attribute but each succeeding one has the attributes of<br>all the preceding ones. (Thus Space has only Sound for its attribute.<br>After Space comes Wind, which has, therefore, both Sound and Touch for<br>its attributes. From Wind comes Light or Fire, which has Sound, Touch,<br>and Form for its attributes. From Light is Water, which has Sound, Touch,<br>Form, and Taste for its attributes. From Water is Earth, which has Sound,<br>Touch, Form, Taste, and Scent for its attributes). If anybody, perceiving<br>Scent in Water, were from ignorance to say that it belongs to Water, he<br>would fall into an error, for Scent is the attribute of Earth though it<br>may exist in a state of attachment with Water and also Wind. These seven<br>kinds of entities, possessing diverse kinds of energy, at first existed<br>separately from one another. They could not create objects without all of<br>them coming together into a state of commingling. All these great<br>entities coming together, and commingling with one another, form the<br>constituent parts of the body which are called limbs.[881] In consequence<br>of the combination of those limbs, the sum total, invested with form and<br>having six and ten constituent parts, becomes what is called the body.<br>(When the gross body is thus formed), the subtile Mahat, with the<br>unexhausted residue of acts, then enters that combination called the<br>gross body.[882] Then the original Creator of all beings, having by his<br>Maya divided Himself, enters that subtile form for surveying or<br>overlooking everything. And inasmuch as he is the original Creator of all<br>beings he is on that account called the Lord of all beings.[883] It is he<br>who creates all beings mobile and immobile. After having thus assumed the<br>form of Brahman he creates the worlds of the gods, the Rishis, the<br>Pitris, and men; the rivers, the seas, and the oceans, the points of the<br>horizon, countries and provinces, hills and mountains, and large trees,<br>human beings, Kinnaras, Rakshasas, birds, animals domestic and wild, and<br>snakes. Indeed, he creates both kinds of existent things, viz., those<br>that are mobile and those that are immobile; and those that are<br>destructible and those that are indestructible. Of these created objects<br>each obtains those attributes which it had during the previous Creation;<br>and each, indeed, obtains repeatedly the same attributes at every<br>subsequent Creation. Determined in respect of character by either<br>injuriousness or peacefulness, mildness or fierceness, righteousness or<br>unrighteousness, truthfulness or untruthfulness, each creature, at every<br>new creation, obtains that particular attribute which it had cherished<br>before. It is in consequence of this that that particular attribute<br>attaches to it. It is the Ordainer himself who attaches variety to the<br>great entities (of Space, Earth, etc.), to the objects of the senses<br>(such as form, etc.), and to size or bulk of existent matter, and<br>appoints the relations of creatures with those multiform entities.<br>Amongst men who have devoted themselves to the science of things, there<br>are some who say that, in the production of effects, exertion is supreme.<br>Some learned persons say that Destiny is supreme, and some that it is<br>Nature which is the agent. Others say that Acts flowing from (personal)<br>exertion, and Destiny, produce effects, aided by Nature. Instead of<br>regarding any of these as singly competent for the production of effects,<br>they say that it is the union of all three that produces all effects. As<br>regards this subject,[884] some say that such is the case; some, that<br>such is not the case; some, that both of these are not the case; and<br>some, that it is not that the reverse of both are not. These, of course,<br>are the contentions of those that depend on Acts, with reference to<br>objects. They however, whose vision is directed to truth regard Brahma as<br>the cause.[885] Penance is the highest good for living creatures. The<br>roots of penance are tranquillity and self-restraint. By penance one<br>obtains all things that one wishes for in one's mind. By penance one<br>attains to that Being who creates the universe. He who (by penance)<br>succeeds in attaining to that Being becomes the puissant master of all<br>beings. It is by Penance that the Rishis are enabled to read the Vedas<br>ceaselessly. At the outset the Self-born caused those excellent Vedic<br>sounds, that are embodiments of knowledge and that have neither beginning<br>nor end to (spring up and) flow on (from preceptor to disciple). From<br>those sounds have sprung all kinds of actions. The names of the Rishis,<br>all things that have been created, the varieties of form seen in existent<br>things, and the course of actions, have their origin in the Vedas.[886]<br>Indeed, the Supreme Master of all beings, in the beginning, created all<br>things from the words of the Vedas. Truly, the names of the Rishis, and<br>all else that has been created, occur in the Vedas. Upon the expiration<br>of his night (i.e., at the dawn of his day), the uncreate Brahman<br>creates, from prototypes that existed before, all things which are, of<br>course, well-made by Him.[887] In the Vedas hath been indicated the topic<br>of the Soul's Emancipation, along with the ten means constituted by study<br>of the Vedas, adoption of the domestic mode of life, penances, observance<br>of duties common to all the modes of life, sacrifices, performance of all<br>such acts as lead to pure fame, meditation which is of three kinds, and<br>that kind of emancipation which is called success (Siddhi) attainable in<br>this life.[888] That incomprehensible Brahma which has been declared in<br>the words of the Vedas, and which has been indicated more clearly in the<br>Upanishads by those who have an insight into the Vedas, can be realised<br>by gradually following the practices referred to above.[889] Unto a<br>person who thinks he has a body, this consciousness of duality, fraught<br>again with that of pairs of opposites, is born only of acts in which he<br>is engaged. (That consciousness of duality ceases during dreamless<br>slumber or when Emancipation has been attained). That person, however,<br>who has attained to Emancipation, aided by his knowledge, forcibly drives<br>off that consciousness of duality. Two Brahmas should be known, viz., the<br>Brahma represented by sound (i.e., the Vedas), and secondly that which is<br>beyond the Vedas and is supreme. One that is conversant with Brahma<br>represented by sound succeeds in attaining to Brahma that is Supreme. The<br>slaughter of animals is the sacrifice laid down for the Kshatriyas. The<br>growing of corn is the sacrifice laid down for the Vaisyas. Serving the<br>three other orders is the sacrifice laid down for the Sudras. Penances<br>(or worship of Brahma) is the sacrifice laid down for the Brahmanas. In<br>the Krita age the performance of sacrifices was not necessary. Such<br>performance became necessary in the Treta age. In the Dwapara, sacrifices<br>have begun to fall off. In the Kali, the same is the case with them. In<br>Krita age, men, worshipping only one Brahma, looked upon the Richs, the<br>Samans, the Yajuses and the rites and sacrifices that are performed from<br>motives of advantage, as all different from the object of their worship,<br>and practised only Yoga, by means of penances. In the Treta age, many<br>mighty men appeared that swayed all mobile and immobile objects. (Though<br>the generality of men in that age were not naturally inclined to the<br>practice of righteousness, yet those great leaders forced them to such<br>practice.) Accordingly, in that age, the Vedas, and sacrifices and the<br>distinctions between the several orders, and the four modes of life,<br>existed in a compact state. In consequence, however, of the decrease in<br>the period of life in Dwapara, all these, in that age, fall off from that<br>compact condition. In the Kali age, all the Vedas become so scarce that<br>they may not be even seen by men. Afflicted by iniquity, they suffer<br>extermination along with the rites and sacrifices laid down in them. The<br>righteousness which is seen in the Krita age is now visible in such<br>Brahmanas as are of cleansed souls and as are devoted to penances and the<br>study of the scriptures. As regards the other yugas, it is seen that<br>without at once giving up the duties and acts that are consistent with<br>righteousness, men, observant of the practices of their respective<br>orders, and conversant with the ordinance of the Vedas are led by the<br>authority of the scriptures, to betake themselves from motives of<br>advantage and interest to sacrifices and vows and pilgrimages to sacred<br>waters and spots.[890] As in the season of rains a large variety of new<br>objects of the immobile order are caused to come forth into life by the<br>showers that fall from the clouds, even so many new kinds of duty or<br>religious observances are brought about in each yuga. As the same<br>phenomena reappear with the reappearance of the seasons, even so, at each<br>new Creation the same attributes appear in each new Brahman and Hara. I<br>have, before this, spoken to thee of Time which is without beginning and<br>without end, and which ordains this variety in the universe. It is that<br>Time which creates and swallows up all creatures. All the innumerable<br>creatures that exist subject to pairs of opposites and according to their<br>respective natures, have Time for their refuge. It is Time that assumes<br>those shapes and it is Time that upholds them.[891] I have thus<br>discoursed to thee, O son, on the topics about which thou hadst inquired,<br>viz., Creation, Time, Sacrifices and other rites, the Vedas, the real<br>actor in the universe, action, and the consequences of action.'"
