                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Like one that drinks nectar I am never satiated with<br>listening to thee as thou speakest. As a person possessing a knowledge of<br>self is never satiated with meditation, even so I am never satiated with<br>hearing thee. Do thou, therefore, O grandsire, discourse once more upon<br>morality. I am never satiated with drinking the nectar of thy discourse<br>upon morality.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative of the<br>discourse between Gotama and the illustrious Yama. Gotama owned a wide<br>retreat on the Paripatra hills. Listen to me as to how many years he<br>dwelt in that abode. For sixty thousand years that sage underwent ascetic<br>austerities in that asylum. One day, the Regent of the world, Yama, O<br>tiger among men, repaired to that great sage of cleansed soul while he<br>was engaged in the severest austerities. Yama beheld the great ascetic<br>Gotama of rigid penances. The regenerate sage understanding that it was<br>Yama who had come, speedily saluted him and sat with joined hands in an<br>attentive attitude (waiting for his commands). The royal Dharma,<br>beholding that bull among Brahmanas, duly saluted him (in return) and<br>addressing him asked what he was to do for him.'<br><br>"Gotama said, "By doing what acts does one liberate one's self from the<br>debt One owes to one's mother and father? How also does one succeed in<br>winning regions of pure bliss that are so difficult of attainment?'<br><br>"Yama said, 'Devoting one's self to the duty of truth, and practising<br>purity and penances one should ceaselessly worship one's mother and<br>father. One should also perform Horse-sacrifices with presents in<br>profusion unto the Brahmanas. By such acts one wins many regions (of<br>felicity) of wonderful aspect.'"
