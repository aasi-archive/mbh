                            "Bhishma said, 'There, under that banian, for the protection of his<br>guest, the prince of birds had kindled and kept up a fire with high and<br>blazing flames.[496] On one side of the fire, the bird slept trustfully.<br>The ungrateful and wicked-souled wretch prepared to slay his sleeping<br>host. With the aid of that blazing fire he killed the trustful bird, and<br>having despatched him, became filled with delight, never thinking there<br>was sin in what he did. Peeling off the feathers and the down, he roasted<br>the flesh on that fire. Then taking it up with the gold he had brought,<br>the Brahmana Red quickly from that spot. The next day, the Rakshasa king,<br>Virupaksha, addressing his son, said, 'Alas, O son, I do not behold<br>Rajadharman, that best of birds, today. Every morning he repairs to the<br>regions of Brahman for adoring the Grandsire. While returning, he never<br>goes home without paying me a visit. These two mornings and two nights<br>have passed away without his having come to my abode. My mind, therefore,<br>is not in peace. Let my friend be enquired after. Gautama, who came here,<br>is without Vedic studies and destitute of Brahmanic splendour. He has<br>found his way to the abode of my friend. I greatly fear, that worst of<br>Brahmanas has slain Rajadharman. Of evil practices and wicked<br>understanding, I read him through by the signs he showed. Without<br>compassion, of cruel and grim visage, and wicked, that vilest of men is<br>like a robber. That Gautama has gone to the abode of my friend. For this<br>reason, my heart has become extremely anxious. O son, proceeding hence<br>with great speed to the abode of Rajadharman, ascertain whether that<br>pure-souled bird is still alive. Do not tarry.' Thus addressed by his<br>sire, the prince, accompanied by other Rakshasas, proceeded with great<br>speed. Arrived at the foot of that banian, he saw the remains of<br>Rajadharman. Weeping with grief, the son of the intelligent king of the<br>Rakshasas, ran with great speed and to the utmost of his power, for<br>seizing Gautama. The Rakshasas had not to go far when they succeeded in<br>catching the Brahmana and discovering the body of Rajadharman destitute<br>of wings, bones, and feet. Taking the captive with them, the Rakshasas<br>returned with great speed to Meruvraja, and showed the king the mutilated<br>body of Rajadharman, and that ungrateful and singing wretch, viz.,<br>Gautama. Beholding the remains of his friend the king, with his<br>counsellors and priest, began to weep aloud. Indeed, loud was the voice<br>of lamentation that was heard in his abode. The entire city of the<br>Rakshasa king, men, women, and children, became plunged in woe. The king<br>then addressed his son saying, 'Let this sinful wretch be slain. Let<br>these Rakshasas here feast merrily on his flesh. Of sinful deeds, of<br>sinful habits, of sinful soul, and inured to sin, this wretch, I think,<br>should be slain by you.' Thus addressed by the Rakshasa king, many<br>Rakshasas of terrible prowess expressed their unwillingness to eat the<br>flesh of that sinner. Indeed, those wanderers of the night, addressing<br>their king, said, 'Let this vilest of men be given away to the robbers.'<br>Bending their heads to their king, they told him so, adding, 'It behoveth<br>thee not to give us this sinful wretch for our food.' The king said unto<br>them, 'Let it be so! Let this ungrateful wight be given to the robbers<br>then without delay.' Thus addressed by him, the Rakshasas armed with<br>lances and battle-axes, hacked that vile wretch into pieces and gave them<br>away to the robbers. It so happened, however, that the very robbers<br>refused to eat the flesh of that vile man. Though cannibals, O monarch,<br>they would not eat an ungrateful person. For one that slays a Brahmana,<br>for one that drinks alcohol, for one that steals, for one that has fallen<br>away from a vow, there is expiation, O king. But there is no expiation<br>for an ungrateful person. That cruel and vile man who injures a friend<br>and becomes ungrateful, is not eaten by the very cannibals nor by the<br>worms that feed on carrion.'
