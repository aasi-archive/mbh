                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Time, that is fraught, with terror unto all<br>creatures, is running his course. What is that source of good after which<br>one should strive? Tell me this, O grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative of a<br>discourse between a sire and a son. Listen to it, O Yudhishthira! Once on<br>a time, O son of Pritha, a regenerate person devoted only to the study of<br>the Vedas had a very intelligent son who was known by the name of<br>Medhavin. Himself conversant with the religion of Emancipation, the, son<br>one day asked his father who was not conversant with that religion and<br>who was engaged in following the precepts of the Vedas, this question.'<br><br>"The son said, 'What should a man of intelligence do, O sire, knowing<br>that the period of existence allotted to men runs fast away? Tell me this<br>truly and in proper order, O father, so that, guided by thy instructions<br>I may set myself to the acquisition of virtue.'<br><br>"The sire said, 'Having studied the Vedas all the while observing the<br>duties of Brahmacharya, O son, one should then desire for offspring for<br>the sake of rescuing one's sires. Having established one's fire then and<br>performing the sacrifices that are ordained, one should then retire into<br>the woods and (having lived as a forest-recluse) one should then become a<br>Muni (by casting off everything and calmly waiting for dissolution).'<br><br>"The son said, 'When the world is thus assailed and thus besieged on all<br>sides, and when such irresistible (bolts) are falling in every direction,<br>how can you speak so calmly?'<br><br>"The sire said, 'How is the world assailed? By what is it besieged? What<br>are those irresistible bolts that are falling on every side? Dost thou<br>frighten me with thy words?'<br><br>"The son said, 'The world is assailed by Death. It is besieged by what is<br>it besieged? What are those irresistible bolts that are falling on every<br>side? Dost thou frighten me with thy words?'<br><br>"The son said, 'The world is assailed by Death. It is besieged by<br>Decrepitude. Days and Nights are continually falling (like bolts). Why do<br>you not take heed of these? When I know that Death does not wait here for<br>any one (but snatches all away suddenly and without notice), how can I<br>possibly wait (for his coming) thus enveloped in a coat of Ignorance and<br>(heedlessly) attending to my concerns? When as each night passes away the<br>period of every one's life wears away with it, when, indeed, one's<br>position is similar to that of a fish in a piece of shallow water, who<br>can feel happy? Death encounters one in the very midst of one's concerns,<br>before the attainment of one's objects, finding one as unmindful as a<br>person while engaged in plucking flowers.[1323] That which is kept for<br>being done tomorrow should be done today; and that which one thinks of<br>doing in the afternoon should be done in the forenoon. Death does not<br>wait, mindful of one's having done or not done one's acts. Do today what<br>is for thy good (without keeping it for tomorrow). See that Death, who is<br>irresistible, may not overcome thee (before you accomplish thy acts). Who<br>knows that Death will not come to one this very day? Before one's acts<br>are completed, Death drags one away. One should, therefore, commence to<br>practise virtue while one is still young (without waiting for one's old<br>age). for life is uncertain. By acquiring virtue one is sure to eternal<br>happiness both here and hereafter. Overpowered by folly one girds up<br>one's loins for acting on behalf of one's sons and wives. By<br>accomplishing acts foul or fair, one gratifies these (relatives). Him<br>possessed of sons and animals, and with mind devotedly attached to them,<br>Death seizes and runs away like a tiger bearing away a sleeping<br>deer.[1324] While one is still engaged in winning diverse objects of<br>desire, and while still unsatiated with one's enjoyment, Death seizes one<br>and runs away like a she-wolf seizing a sheep and running away with it.<br>'This has been done',&#8212;'this remains to be done',&#8212;'this other is half<br>done',&#8212;one may say thus to oneself; but Death, unmindful of one's desire<br>to finish one's unfinished acts, seizes and drags one away. One that has<br>not yet obtained the fruit of what one has already done, amongst those<br>attached to action, one busied with one's field or shop or house, Death<br>seizes and carries away. The weak, the strong; the wise, the brave, the<br>idiotic, the learned, or him that has not yet obtained the gratification<br>of any of his desires, Death seizes and bears away. Death, decrepitude,<br>disease, sorrow, and many things of a similar kind, are incapable of<br>being avoided by mortals. How, then, O father, canst thou sit so at thy<br>ease? As soon as a creature is born, Decrepitude and Death come and<br>possess him for his destruction. All these forms of existence mobile and<br>immobile, are possessed by these two (viz., Decrepitude and Death). When<br>the soldiers that compose Death's army are on their march, nothing can<br>resist them, except that one thing, viz., the power of Truth, for in<br>Truth alone Immortality dwells. The delight that one feels of residing in<br>the midst of men is the abode of Death. The Sruti declares that that<br>which is called the forest is the true fold for the Devas, while the<br>delight one feels in dwelling in the midst of men is, as it were, the<br>cord for binding the dweller (and making him helpless).[1325] The<br>righteous cut it and escape. The sinful do not succeed in cutting it (and<br>freeing themselves). He who does not injure other creatures in thought,<br>word and deed, and who never injures others by taking away their means of<br>sustenance, is never injured by any creature.[1326] For these reasons,<br>one should practise the vow of truth, be steadily devoted to the vow of<br>truth, and should desire nothing but the truth. Restraining all one's<br>senses and looking upon all creatures with an equal eye, one should<br>vanquish Death with the aid of Truth. Both Immortality and Death are<br>planted in the body. Death is encountered from folly, and Immortality is<br>won by Truth. Transcending desire and wrath, and abstaining from injury,<br>I shall adopt Truth and happily achieving what is for my good, avoid<br>Death like an Immortal. Engaged in the Sacrifice that is constituted by<br>Peace, and employed also in the Sacrifice of Brahma, and restraining my<br>senses, the Sacrifices I shall perform are those of speech, mind, and<br>acts, when the sun enters his northerly course.[1327] How can one like me<br>perform an Animal Sacrifice which is fraught with cruelty? How can one<br>like me, that is possessed of wisdom, perform like a cruel Pisacha, a<br>Sacrifice of Slaughter after the manner of what is laid down for the<br>Kshatriyas,&#8212;a Sacrifice that is, besides, endued with rewards that are<br>terminable? In myself have I been begotten by my own self. O father,<br>without seeking to procreate offspring, I shall rest myself on my own<br>self. I shall perform the Sacrifice of Self, I need no offspring to<br>rescue me.[1328] He whose words and thoughts are always well-restrained,<br>he who has Penances and Renunciation, and Yoga, is sure to attain to<br>everything through these. There is no eye equal to Knowledge. There is no<br>reward equal to Knowledge. There is no sorrow equal to attachment. There<br>is no happiness equal to Renunciation. For a Brahmana there can be no<br>wealth like residence in solitude, an equal regard for all creatures,<br>truthfulness of speech, steady observance of good conduct, the total<br>abandonment of the rod (of chastisement), simplicity, and the gradual<br>abstention from all acts.[1329] What need hast thou with wealth and what<br>need with relatives and friends, and what with spouses? Thou art a<br>Brahmana and thou hast death to encounter. Search thy own Self that is<br>concealed in a cave. Whither have thy grandsires gone and whither thy<br>sire too?'[1330]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Hearing these words of his son, the sire acted in the way<br>that was pointed out, O king! Do thou also act in the same way, devoted<br>to the religion of Truth.'"
