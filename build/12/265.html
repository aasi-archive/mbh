                            "Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited an old narrative of what was<br>recited by king Vichakhy through compassion for all creatures. Beholding<br>the mangled body of a bull, and hearing the exceedingly painful groans of<br>the kine in a cow-slaying sacrifice, and observing the cruel Brahmanas<br>that gathered there for assisting at the ceremonies, that king[1195]<br>uttered these words, 'Prosperity to all the kine in the world.' When the<br>slaughter had commenced, these words expressive of a blessing (to those<br>helpless animals) were pronounced. And the monarch further said, 'Only<br>those that are transgressors of defined limits, that are destitute of<br>intelligence, that are atheists and sceptics, and that desire the<br>acquisition of celebrity through sacrifices and religious rites speak<br>highly of the slaughter of animals in sacrifices.[1196] The<br>righteous-souled Manu has applauded (the observance of) harmlessness in<br>all (religious) acts. Indeed, men slaughter animals in sacrifices, urged<br>by only the desire of fruit.[1197] Hence, guided by authority (in respect<br>of slaughter and abstention from slaughter or harmlessness) one<br>conversant (with the scriptures) should practise the true course of duty<br>which is exceedingly subtile. Harmlessness to all creatures is the<br>highest of all duties. Living in the vicinity of an inhabited place and<br>injuring oneself to the observance of rigid vows, and disregarding the<br>fruits indicated of Vedic acts, one should give up domesticity, adopting<br>a life of Renunciation. Only they that are mean are urged by the desire<br>of fruit.[1198] Reverentially mentioning sacrifices and trees and<br>sacrificial stakes, men do not eat tainted meat. This practice, however,<br>is not worthy of applause.[1199] Wine, fish, honey, meat, alcohol, and<br>preparations of rice and sesame seeds, have been introduced by knaves.<br>The use of these (in sacrifices) is not laid down in the Vedas. The<br>hankering after these arises from pride, error of judgment, and cupidity.<br>They that are true Brahmanas realise the presence of Vishnu in every<br>sacrifice. His worship, it has been laid down, should be made with<br>agreeable Payasa. (The leaves and flowers of) such trees as have been<br>indicated in the Vedas, whatever act is regarded as worthy and whatever<br>else is held as pure by persons of pure hearts and cleansed natures and<br>those eminent for knowledge and holiness, are all worthy of being offered<br>to the Supreme Deity and not unworthy of His acceptance.'[1200]<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'The body and all sorts of dangers and calamities are<br>continually at war with each other. How, therefore, will a person who is<br>totally free from the desire of harming and who on this account will not<br>be able to act, succeed in keeping up his body?'[1201]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'One should, when able, acquire merit and act in such a<br>way that one's body may not languish and suffer pain, and that death may<br>not come.'"[1202]
