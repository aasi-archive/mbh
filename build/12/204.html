                            "Manu said, 'As in a dream this manifest (body) lies (inactive) and the<br>enlivening spirit in its subtile form, detaching itself from the former,<br>walks forth after the same manner, in the state called deep slumber (or<br>death), the subtile form with all the senses becomes inactive and the<br>Understanding, detached from it remains awake. The same is the case with<br>Existence and Non-Existence.[683] As when quantity of water is clear,<br>images reflected in it can be seen by the eye, after the same manner, if<br>the senses be unperturbed, the Soul is capable of being viewed by the<br>understanding. If, however, the quantity of water gets stirred, the<br>person standing by it can no longer see those images. Similarly, if the<br>senses become perturbed, the Soul can no longer be seen by the<br>understanding. Ignorance begets Delusion. Delusion affects the mind. When<br>the mind becomes vitiated, the five senses which have the mind for their<br>refuge become vitiated also. Surcharged with Ignorance, and sunk in the<br>mire of worldly objects, one cannot enjoy the sweets of contentment or<br>tranquillity. The Soul (thus circumstanced), undetached from its good and<br>evil acts, returns repeatedly unto the objects of the world, in<br>consequence of sin one's thirst is never slaked. One's thirst is slaked<br>only when one's sin is destroyed. In consequence of attachment to worldly<br>objects, which has a tendency to perpetuate itself, one wishes for things<br>other than those for which one should wish, and accordingly fails to<br>attain to the Supreme.[684] From the destruction of all sinful deeds,<br>knowledge arises in men. Upon the appearance of Knowledge, one beholds<br>one's Soul in one's understanding even as one sees one's own reflection<br>in a polished mirror. One obtains misery in consequence of one's senses<br>being unrestrained. One obtains happiness in consequence of one's senses<br>being restrained. Therefore, one should restrain one's mind by<br>self-effort from objects apprehended by the senses.[685] Above the senses<br>is the mind; above the mind is the understanding; above the understanding<br>is the Soul; above the Soul is the Supreme or Great. From the Unmanifest<br>hath sprung the Soul; from the Soul hath sprung the Understanding; from<br>the Understanding hath sprung the Mind. When the Mind becomes associated<br>with the senses, then it apprehends sound and the other objects of the<br>senses. He who casts off those objects, as also all that are manifest, he<br>who liberates himself from all things that arise from primordial matter,<br>being so freed, enjoys immortality.[686] The Sun rising diffuses his<br>rays. When he sets, he withdraws unto himself those very rays that were<br>diffused by him. After the same manner, the Soul, entering the body,<br>obtains the fivefold objects of the senses by diffusing over them his<br>rays represented by the senses. When, however, he turns back, he is said<br>to set by withdrawing those rays unto himself.[687] Repeatedly led along<br>the path that is created by acts, he obtains the fruits of his acts in<br>consequence of his having followed the practice of acts.[688] Desire for<br>the objects of the senses keeps away from a person who does not indulge<br>in such desire. The very principle of desire, however, leaves him who has<br>beheld his soul, which, of course, is entirely free from desire.[689]<br>When the Understanding, freed from attachment to the objects of the<br>senses, becomes fixed in the mind, then does one succeed in attaining to<br>Brahma, for it is there that the mind with the understanding withdrawn<br>into it can possibly be extinguished. Brahma is not an object of touch,<br>or of hearing, or of taste, or of sight, or of smell, or of any deductive<br>inference from the Known. Only the Understanding (when withdrawn from<br>everything else) can attain to it. All objects that the mind apprehends<br>through 'the senses are capable of being withdrawn into the mind; the<br>mind can be withdrawn into the understanding; the Understanding can be<br>withdrawn into the Soul, and the Soul into the Supreme.[690] The senses<br>cannot contribute to the success of the mind. The mind cannot apprehend<br>the Understanding. The Understanding cannot apprehend the manifested<br>Soul. The Soul, however, which is subtile, beholds those all.'"
