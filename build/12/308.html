                            "'Vasishtha said, I have thus far discoursed to thee on the Sankhya<br>philosophy. Listen now to me as I tell thee what is Vidya (knowledge) and<br>what is Avidya (Ignorance), one after the other. The learned say that<br>that Prakriti, which is fraught with the attributes of Creation and<br>Destruction, is called Avidya; while Purusha, who is freed from the<br>attributes of Creation and Destruction and who transcends the four and<br>twenty topics or principles, is called Vidya. Listen to me first as I<br>tell thee what is Vidya among successive sets of other things, as<br>expounded in the Sankhya philosophy. Among the senses of knowledge and<br>those of action, the senses of knowledge are said to constitute what is<br>known as Vidya. Of the senses of knowledge and their object, the former<br>constitute Vidya as has been heard by us. Of objects of the senses and<br>the mind, the wise have said that the mind constitute Vidya. Of mind and<br>the five subtile essences, the five subtile essences constitutes Vidya.<br>Of the five subtile essences and Consciousness, Consciousness constitutes<br>Vidya. Of Consciousness and Mahat, Mahat, O king, is Vidya. Of all the<br>topics or principles beginning with Mahat, and Prakriti, it is Prakriti,<br>which is unmanifest and supreme, that is called Vidya. Of Prakriti, and<br>that called Vidhi which is Supreme, the latter should be known as Vidya.<br>Transcending Prakriti is the twenty-fifth (called Purusha) who should be<br>known as Vidya. Of all knowledge that which is the Object of Knowledge<br>has been said to be the Unmanifest, O king.[1627] Again, Knowledge has<br>been said to be Unmanifest and the Object of knowledge to be that which<br>transcends the four and twenty. Once more, Knowledge has been said to be<br>Unmanifest, and the Knower is that which transcends the four and twenty.<br>I have now told thee what is truly the import of Vidya and Avidya. Listen<br>now to me as I tell thee all that has been said about the Indestructible,<br>and the Destructible. Both Jiva and Prakriti have been said to be<br>Indestructible, and both of them have been said to be Destructible. I<br>shall tell thee the reason of this correctly as I have understood it.<br>Both Prakriti and Jiva are without beginning and without end or<br>destruction. Both of them are regarded as supreme (in the matter of<br>Creation). Those that are possessed of knowledge say that both are to be<br>called topics or principles. In consequence of its attributes of<br>(repeated) Creation and Destruction, the Unmanifest (or Prakriti) is<br>called Indestructible. That Unmanifest becomes repeatedly modified for<br>the purpose of creating the principle. And because the principles<br>beginning with Mahat are produced by Purusha as well, and because also<br>Purusha and the Unmanifest are mutually dependant upon each other,<br>therefore is Purusha also, the twenty-fifth, called Kshetra (and hence<br>Akshara or Indestructible).[1628] When the Yogin withdraws and merges all<br>the principles into the Unmanifest Soul (or Brahma) then the twenty-fifth<br>(viz., Jiva or Purusha) also, with all those principles disappears into<br>it. When the principles become merged each into its progenitor, then the<br>one that remains is Prakriti. When Kshetrajna too,[1629] O son, becomes<br>merged into his own producing cause then (all that remains is Brahma and,<br>therefore) Prakriti with all the principles in it becomes Kshara (or<br>meets with destruction), and attains also to the condition of being<br>without attributes in consequence of her dissociation from all the<br>principles. Thus it is that Kshetrajna, when his knowledge of Kshetra<br>disappears, becomes, by his nature, destitute of attributes, as it has<br>been heard by us. When he becomes Kshara he then assumes attributes.<br>When, however, he attains to his own real nature, he then succeeds in<br>understanding his own condition of being really destitute of attributes.<br>By casting off Prakriti and beginning to realise that he is different<br>from her, the intelligent Kshetrajna then comes to be regarded as pure<br>and stainless. When Jiva ceases to exist in a state of union with<br>Prakriti, then does he become identifiable with Brahma. When, however, he<br>exists united with Prakriti, he then, O king, seems to be different from<br>Brahma. Indeed, when Jiva shows no affection for Prakriti and her<br>principles, he then succeeds in beholding the Supreme and having once<br>beheld Him wishes not to fall away from that felicity. When the knowledge<br>of truth dawns upon him, Jiva begins to lament in this strain: Alas, how<br>foolishly have I acted by falling through ignorance, into this frame<br>composed of Prakriti like a fish entangled in a net! Alas, through<br>ignorance, I have migrated from body to body like a fish from water to<br>water thinking that water is the element in which alone it can live.<br>Indeed, like a fish that does not know anything else than water to be its<br>element, I also have never known anything else than children and spouses<br>to be my own! Fie on me that through ignorance, I have been repeatedly<br>migrating from body to body in forgetfulness (of the Supreme Soul)! The<br>Supreme Soul alone is my friend. I have capacity for friendship with Him.<br>Whatever be my nature and whoever I may be, I am competent to be like Him<br>and to attain an identity with Him. I see my similarity with Him. I am<br>indeed, like Him. He is stainless. It is evident that I am of the same<br>nature. Through ignorance and stupefaction, I have become associated with<br>inanimate Prakriti. Though really without attachments, I have passed this<br>long time in a state of attachment with Prakriti. Alas, by her was I so<br>long subdued without having been able to know it. Various are the<br>forms&#8212;high, middling, and low, that Prakriti assume. Oh, how shall I<br>dwell in those forms?[1630] How shall I live conjointly with her? In<br>consequence only of my ignorance I repair to her companionship. I shall<br>now be fixed (in Sankhya or Yoga). I shall not longer keep her<br>companionship. For having passed so long a time with her, I should think<br>that I was so long deceived by her, for myself being really exempt from<br>modification, how could I keep company with one that is subject to<br>modification? She cannot be held to be responsible for this. The<br>responsibility is mine, since turning away from the Supreme Soul I become<br>of my own accord attached to her. In consequence of that attachment,<br>myself, though formless in reality, had to abide in multifarious forms.<br>Indeed, though formless by nature I become endued with forms in<br>consequence of my sense of meum, and thereby insulted and distressed. In<br>consequence of my sense of meum, concerning the result of Prakriti, I am<br>forced to take birth in diverse orders of Being. Alas, though really<br>destitute of any sense of meum, yet in consequence of affecting it, what<br>diverse acts of an evil nature have been committed by me in those orders<br>which I took birth while I remained in them with a soul that had lost all<br>knowledge! I have no longer anything to do with him who, with essence<br>made up of consciousness, divides herself into many fragments and who<br>seeks to unite me with them. It is only now that I have been awakened and<br>have understood that I am by nature without any sense of meum and without<br>that consciousness which creates the forms of Prakriti that invests me<br>all around. Casting off that sense of meum which I always have with<br>respect to her and whose essence is made up of consciousness, and casting<br>off Prakriti herself, I shall take refuge in Him who is auspicious. I<br>shall be united with Him, and not with Prakriti which is inanimate. If I<br>unite with Him, it will be productive of my benefit. I have no similarity<br>of nature with Prakriti!&#8212;The twenty-fifth, (viz., Jiva), when he thus<br>succeeds in understanding the Supreme, becomes able to cast off the<br>Destructible and attain to identity with that which is Indestructible and<br>which is the essence of all that is auspicious, Destitute of attributes<br>in his true nature and in reality Unmanifest, Jiva becomes invested with<br>what is Manifest and assumes attributes. When he succeeds in beholding<br>that which is without attributes and which is the origin of the<br>Unmanifest, he attains, O ruler of Mithila, to identify the same.<br><br>"'I have now told thee what the indications are of what is Indestructible<br>and what is Destructible, according to the best of my knowledge and<br>according to what has been expounded in the scriptures. I shall now tell<br>thee, according to what I have heard, as to how Knowledge that is<br>subtile, stainless, and certain arises. Do thou listen to me. I have<br>already discoursed to thee what the Sankhya and the Yoga systems are<br>according to their respective indications as expounded in their<br>respective scriptures. Verily, the science that has been expounded in<br>Sankhya treatises is identical with what has been laid down in the Yoga<br>scriptures. The knowledge, O monarch, which the Sankhya preach, is<br>capable of awakening every one. In the Sankhya scriptures, that Knowledge<br>has been inculcated very clearly for the benefit of disciples. The<br>learned say that this Sankhya system is very extensive. Yogin have great<br>regard for that system as also for the Vedas. In the Sankhya system no<br>topic or principle transcending the twenty-fifth is admitted. That which<br>the Sankhyas regard-as their highest topic of principles has been duly<br>described (by me). In the Yoga philosophy, it is said that Brahma, which<br>is the essence of knowledge without duality, becomes Jiva only when<br>invested with Ignorance. In the Yoga scriptures, therefore, both Brahma<br>and Jiva are spoken of,&#8212;'"
