                            "Yudhishthira said, "If a person, weak, worthless, and light-hearted, O<br>grand sire, doth from folly provoke, by means of unbecoming and boastful<br>speeches, a powerful foe always residing in his vicinity, competent to do<br>good (when pleased) and chastise (when displeased), and always ready for<br>action, how should the former, relying on his own strength, act when the<br>latter advances against him in anger and from desire of exterminating<br>him?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited, O chief of the Bharatas, the<br>old story of the discourse between Salmali and Pavana. There was a lordly<br>(Salmali) tree on one of the heights of Himavat. Having grown for many<br>centuries, he had spread out his branches wide around. His trunk also was<br>huge and his twigs and leaves were innumerable. Under his shade toil-worn<br>elephants in rut, bathed in sweat, used to rest, and many animals of<br>other species also. The girth of his trunk was four hundred cubits, and<br>dense was the shade of his branches and leaves. Loaded with flowers and<br>fruits, it was the abode of innumerable parrots, male and female. In<br>travelling along their routes, caravans of merchants and traders, and<br>ascetics, residing in the woods, used to rest under the shade of that<br>delightful monarch of the forest. One day, the sage Narada, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, seeing the wide-extending and innumerable branches of<br>that tree and the circumference of his trunk, approached and addressed<br>him, saying, 'O thou art delightful! O thou art charming! O foremost of<br>trees, O Salmali, I am always delighted at thy sight! O charming tree,<br>delightful birds of diverse kinds, and elephants and other animals,<br>cheerfully live; on thy branches and under their shade. Thy branches, O<br>wide-branched monarch of the forest, and thy trunk are gigantic. I never<br>see any of them broken by the god of the wind. Is it, O child, the case<br>that Pavana is pleased with thee and is thy friend so that he protects<br>thee always in these woods? The illustrious Pavana possessed of great<br>speed and force moveth from their sites the tallest and strongest trees,<br>and even mountain summits. That sacred bearer of perfumes, blowing (when<br>he wills) drieth up rivers and takes and seas, including the very nether<br>region. Without doubt, Pavana protects thee through friendship. It is for<br>this reason that, though possessed of innumerable branches, thou art<br>still graced with leaves and flowers. O monarch of the forest, this thy<br>verdure is delightful since these winged creatures, O child, filled with<br>joy, sport on thy twigs and branches. During the season when thou puttest<br>forth thy blossoms, the sweet notes of all these denizens of thy branches<br>are heard separately when they indulge in their melodious songs. Then,<br>again, O Salmali, these elephants that are the ornaments of their<br>species, bathed in sweat and indulging in cries (of delight), approach<br>thee and find happiness here. Similarly, diverse other species of animals<br>inhabiting the woods, contribute to adorn thee. Indeed, O tree, thou<br>lookest beautiful even like the mountains of Meru peopled by creatures of<br>every kind. Resorted to also by Brahmanas crowned with ascetic success,<br>by others engaged in penances, and by Yatis devoted to<br>contemplation,[454] this thy region, I think, resembles heaven itself.'"
