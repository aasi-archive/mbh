                            "Yudhishthira said, 'It has been said that in seasons of distress a<br>Brahmana may support himself by the practice of Kshatriya duties. Can he,<br>however, at any time, support himself by the practice of the duties laid<br>down for the Vaisyas?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'When a Brahmana loses his means of support and falls into<br>distress, he may certainly betake himself to the practices of a Vaisya<br>and derive his support by agriculture and keeping cattle, if, of course,<br>he is incompetent for Kshatriya duties.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'If a Brahmana, O bull of Bharata's race, betakes<br>himself to the duties of a Vaisya, what articles may he sell without<br>losing his prospect of heaven?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Wines, salt, sesamum seeds, animals having manes, bulls,<br>honey, meat, and cooked food, O Yudhishthira, under all circumstances, a<br>Brahmana should avoid. A Brahmana, by selling these, would sink into<br>hell. A Brahmana, by selling a goat, incurs the sin of selling the god of<br>fire; by selling a sheep, the sin of selling the god of water; by selling<br>a horse, the sin of selling the god of the sun; by selling cooked food,<br>the sin of selling land; and by selling a cow, the sin of selling<br>sacrifice and the Soma juice. These, therefore, should not be sold (by a<br>Brahmana). They that are good do not applaud the purchase of uncooked<br>food by giving cooked food in exchange. Uncooked food, however, may be<br>given for procuring cooked food, O Bharata![234] 'We will eat this cooked<br>food of thine. Thou mayst cook these raw things (that we give in<br>exchange).'&#8212;In a compact of this kind there is no sin. Listen, O<br>Yudhishthira, I shall speak to thee of the eternal practice, existing<br>from days of old, of persons conducting themselves according to approved<br>usages. 'I give thee this. Give me this other thing in return.' Exchange<br>by such agreement is righteous. To take things by force, however, is<br>sinful. Even such is the course of the usage followed by the Rishis and<br>others. Without doubt, this is righteous.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'When, O sire, all the orders, giving up their<br>respective duties, take up arms against the king, then, of course, the<br>power of the king decreases.&#8212;By what means should the king then become<br>the protector and refuge of the people? Resolve this doubt of mine, O<br>king, by speaking to me in detail.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'By gifts, by penances, by sacrifices, by peacefulness,<br>and by self-restraint, all the orders headed by the Brahmanas should, on<br>such occasions, seek their own good. Those amongst them that are endued<br>with Vedic strength, should rise up on every side and like the gods<br>strengthening Indra contribute (by Vedic rites) to enhancing the strength<br>of the king. Brahmanas are said to be the refuge of the king while his<br>power suffers decay. A wise king seeks the enhancement of his power by<br>means of the power of the Brahmanas. When the king, crowned with victory,<br>seeks the re-establishment of peace, all the orders then betake<br>themselves to their respective duties. When robbers, breaking through all<br>restraints, spread devastation around, all the orders may take up arms.<br>By so doing they incur no sin, O Yudhishthira!'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'If all the Kshatriyas become hostile towards the<br>Brahmanas, who then will protect the Brahmanas and their Vedas? What then<br>should be the duty of the Brahmanas and who will be their refuge?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'By penances, by Brahmacharya, by weapons, and by<br>(physical) might, applied with or without the aid of deceit, the<br>Kshatriyas should be subjugated. If the Kshatriya misconducts himself,<br>especially towards Brahmanas, the Vedas themselves will subjugate them.<br>The Kshatriyas have sprung from the Brahmanas. Fire has sprung from<br>water; the Kshatriya from the Brahmana; and iron from stone. The energy<br>of fire, the Kshatriya, and iron, are irresistible. But when these come<br>into contact with the sources of their origin, their force becomes<br>neutralised. When iron strikes stone, or fire battles with water, or the<br>Kshatriya becomes hostile to the Brahmana, then the strength of each of<br>those three becomes destroyed. Thus, O Yudhishthira, the energy and<br>might, howsoever great and irresistible, of Kshatriyas become quelled as<br>soon as they are directed against the Brahmanas. When the energy of the<br>Brahmanas becomes mild, when Kshatriya energy becomes weak, when all men<br>misbehave themselves towards the Brahmanas, they that engage in battle<br>then, casting off all fear of death, for protecting the Brahmanas,<br>morality, and their own selves,&#8212;those persons, moved by righteous<br>indignation and possessed of great strength of mind, succeed in winning<br>high regions of bliss hereafter. All persons should take up arms for the<br>sake of Brahmanas. Those brave persons that fight for Brahmanas attain to<br>those felicitous region in heaven that are reserved for persons that have<br>always studied the Vedas with attention, that have performed the<br>austerest of penances, and that have, after fasting, cast off their<br>bodies into blazing fires. The Brahmana, by taking up arms for the three<br>orders, does not incur sin. People say that there is no higher duty than<br>casting off life under such circumstances. I bow to them and blessed be<br>they that thus lay down their lives in seeking to chastise the enemies of<br>Brahmanas. Let us attain to that region which is intended for them. Manu<br>himself has said that those heroes repair to the region of Brahman. As<br>persons become cleansed of all their sins by undergoing the final bath on<br>a horse-sacrifice even so they that die at the edge of weapons while<br>fighting wicked people, become cleansed of their sins. Righteousness<br>becomes unrighteousness, and unrighteousness becomes righteousness,<br>according to place and time. Such is the power of place and time (in<br>determining the character of human acts). The friends of humanity, by<br>doing even acts of cruelty, have attained to high heaven. Righteous<br>Kshatriyas, by doing even sinful acts, have attained to blessed<br>ends.[235] The Brahmana, by taking up arms on these three occasions, does<br>not incur sin, viz., for protecting himself, for compelling the other<br>orders to betake themselves to their duties, and for chastising robbers.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'If when robbers raise their heads and an<br>inter-mixture of the orders begins to take place in consequence of<br>confusion, and Kshatriyas become incompetent, some powerful person other<br>than a Kshatriya seeks to subdue those robbers for the sake of protecting<br>the people,[236] indeed, O best of kings, if that powerful person happens<br>to be a Brahmana or a Vaisya or a Sudra, and if he succeeds in protecting<br>the people by righteously wielding the rod of chastisement is he<br>justified in doing what he does or is he restrained by the ordinances<br>from accomplishing that duty? It seems that others, when the Kshatriyas<br>prove so wretched, should take up weapons.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Be he a Sudra or be he the member of any other orders, he<br>that becomes a raft on a raftless current, or a means of crossing where<br>means there are none, certainly deserves respect in every way. That<br>person, O king, relying upon whom helpless men, oppressed and made<br>miserable by robbers, live happily, deserve to be lovingly worshipped by<br>all as if he were a near kinsman. The person, O thou of Kuru's race, that<br>dispels the fears of others, always deserves respect. What use is there<br>of bulls that would not bear burthens, or of kine that would not yield<br>milk, or of a wife that is barren? Similarly, what need is there for a<br>king that is not competent to grant protection? As an elephant made of<br>wood, or a deer made of leather, as a person without wealth, or one that<br>is a eunuch, or a field that is sterile, even so is a Brahmana that is<br>void of Vedic lore and a king incapable of granting protection? Both of<br>them are like a cloud that does not pour rain. That person who always<br>protects the good and restrains the wicked deserves to become a king and<br>to govern the world.'"
