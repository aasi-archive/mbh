                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou sayest that righteousness or duty depends upon<br>delicate considerations, that is indicated by the conduct of those that<br>are called good, that it is fraught with restraints (from numerous acts),<br>and that its indications are also contained in the Vedas. It seems to me,<br>however, that I have a certain inward light in consequence of which I can<br>discriminate between right and wrong by inferences.[1127] Numerous<br>questions that I had intended to ask thee have all been answered by thee.<br>There is one question, however, that I shall presently ask. It is not<br>prompted, O king, by desire of empty disputation. All these embodied<br>creatures, it seems, take birth, exist, and leave their bodies, of their<br>own nature. Duty and its reverse, therefore, cannot be ascertained, O<br>Bharata, by study of the scriptures alone.[1128] The duties of a person<br>who is well off are of one kind. Those of a person who has fallen into<br>distress are of another kind. How can duty respecting seasons of distress<br>be ascertained by reading the scriptures alone?[1129] The acts of the<br>good, thou hast said, constitute righteousness (or duty). The good,<br>however, are to be ascertained by their acts. The definition, therefore,<br>has for its foundation, a begging of the question, with the result that<br>what is meant by conduct of the good remains unsettled. It is seen that<br>some ordinary person commits unrighteousness while apparently achieving<br>righteousness. Some extraordinary persons again may be seen who achieve<br>righteousness by committing acts that are apparently unrighteous.[1130]<br>Then, again, the proof (of what I say) has been furnished by even those<br>that are well conversant with the scriptures themselves, for it has been<br>heard by us that the ordinances of the Vedas disappear gradually in every<br>successive age. The duties in the Krita age are of one kind. Those in the<br>Treta are of another kind, and those in the Dwapara are again different.<br>The duties in the Kali age, again, are entirely of another kind. It<br>seems, therefore, that duties have been laid down for the respective ages<br>according to the powers of human beings in the respective ages. When,<br>therefore, all the declarations in the Vedas do not apply equally to all<br>the ages, the saying that the declarations of the Vedas are true is only<br>a popular form of speech indulged in for popular satisfaction. From the<br>Srutis have originated the Smritis whose scope again is very wide. If the<br>Vedas be authority for everything, then authority would attach to the<br>Smritis also for the latter are based on the former. When, however, the<br>Srutis and the Smritis contradict each other, how can either be<br>authoritative? Then again, it is seen that when some wicked persons of<br>great might cause certain portions of certain courses of righteous acts<br>to be stopped, these are destroyed for ever.[1131] Whether we know it or<br>know it not, whether we are able to ascertain it or not to ascertain it,<br>the course of duty is finer than the edge of a razor and grosser than<br>even a mountain. Righteousness (in the form of sacrifices and other<br>religious acts) at first appears in the form of the romantic edifices of<br>vapour seen in the distant sky. When, however, it is examined by the<br>learned, it disappears and becomes invisible.[1132] Like the small ponds<br>at which the cattle drink or the shallow aqueducts along cultivated<br>fields that dry up very soon, the eternal practices inculcated in the<br>Smritis, falling into discontinuance, at last disappear totally (in the<br>Kali age). Amongst men that are not good some are seen to become<br>hypocrites (in respect of the acquisition of righteousness) by suffering<br>themselves to be urged by desire. Some become so, urged by the wishes of<br>others. Others, numbering many, tread in the same path, influenced by<br>diverse other motives of a similar character.[1133] It cannot be denied<br>that such acts (though accomplished by persons under the influence of<br>evil passions) are righteous. Fools, again, say that righteousness is an<br>empty sound among those called good. They ridicule such persons and<br>regard them as men destitute of reason. Many great men, again, turning<br>back (from the duties of their own order) betake themselves to the duties<br>of the kingly order. No such conduct, therefore, is to be seen (as<br>observed by any man), which is fraught with universal benevolence.[1134]<br>By a certain course of conduct one becomes really meritorious. That very<br>course of conduct obstructs another in the acquisition of merit. Another,<br>by practising at his pleasure that conduct, it is seen, remains<br>unchanged.[1135] Thus that conduct by which one becomes meritorious<br>impedes another in the acquisition of merit. One may thus see that all<br>courses of conduct are seen to lose singleness of purpose and character.<br>It seems, therefore, that only that which the learned of ancient times<br>called righteousness is righteousness to this day: and through that<br>course of conduct (which the learned so settled) the distinctions and<br>limitations (that govern the world) have become eternal.'"[1136]
