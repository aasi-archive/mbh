                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, O thou of great wisdom, O thou that are<br>conversant with every kind of scripture, tell me what the merit is of one<br>who cherishes a suppliant that craves for protection.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Great is the merit, O monarch, in cherishing a suppliant.<br>Thou art worthy, O best of the Bharatas, of asking such a question. Those<br>high-souled kings of old, viz., Sivi and others, O king, attained to<br>great bliss in heaven by having protected suppliants. It is heard that a<br>pigeon received with respect a suppliant foe according to due rites and<br>even fed him with his own flesh.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'How, indeed, did a pigeon in days of old feed a<br>suppliant foe with his own flesh? What also was the end, O Bharata, that<br>he won by such conduct?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O king, to this excellent story that cleanses the<br>hearer of every sin, the story, viz., that Bhrigu's son (Rama) had<br>recited to king Muchukunda. This very question, O son of Pritha had been<br>put to Bhrigu's son by Muchukunda with due humility. Unto him desirous of<br>listening with humility the son of Bhrigu narrated this story of how a<br>pigeon, O monarch, won success (entitling him to the highest heavenly<br>bliss).'<br><br>"The sage said, 'O mighty-armed monarch, listen to me as I narrate to<br>thee this story that is fraught with truths connected with Virtue,<br>Profit, and Pleasure. A wicked and terrible fowler, resembling the<br>Destroyer himself, used in days of old to wander through the great<br>forest. He was black as a raven and his eyes were of a bloody hue. He<br>looked like Yama himself. His legs were long, his feet short, his mouth<br>large, and his cheeks protruding. He had no friend, no relative, no<br>kinsman. He had been cast off by them all for the exceedingly cruel life<br>he led. Indeed, a man of wicked conduct should be renounced from a<br>distance by the wise, for he who injures his own self cannot be expected<br>to do good to others. Those cruel and wicked-souled men that take the<br>lives of other creatures are always like poisonous snakes, a source of<br>trouble to all creatures. Taking his nets with him, and killing birds in<br>the woods, he used to sell the meat of those winged creatures, O king<br>(for livelihood). Following such conduct, the wicked-souled wretch lived<br>for many long years without ever understanding the sinfulness of his<br>life. Accustomed for many long years to sport with his wife in the forest<br>in the pursuit of this profession, and stupefied by destiny, no other<br>profession was liked by him. One day as he was wandering through the<br>forest intent on his business, a great storm arose that shook the trees<br>and seemed about to uproot them. In a moment dense clouds appeared on the<br>sky, with flashes of lightning playing amidst them, presenting the aspect<br>of a sea covered with merchants' boats and vessels. He of a hundred<br>sacrifices having entered the clouds with a large supply of rain, in a<br>moment the earth became flooded with water. While yet the rain fell to<br>torrents, the fowler lost his senses through fear. Trembling with cold<br>and agitated with fear, he roved through the forest. The killer of birds<br>failed to find any high spot (which was not under water). The paths of<br>the forest were all submerged. Inconsequence of the force of the shower,<br>many birds were deprived of life or dropped down on the ground. Lions and<br>bears and other animals, availing themselves of some high spots they had<br>found, lay down to rest. All the denizens of the forest were filled with<br>fear in consequence of that frightful storm and shower. Frightened and<br>hungry they roamed through the woods in packs, small and large. The<br>fowler, however, with limbs stiffened by cold, could neither stop where<br>he was nor move. While in this state he eyed a she-pigeon lying on the<br>ground, stiffened with cold. The sinful wight, though himself in the same<br>predicament, beholding the bird, picked her up and immured her in a cage.<br>Himself overwhelmed with affliction, he scrupled not to overwhelm a<br>fellow-creature with affliction. Indeed, the wretch, through force of<br>habit alone, committed that sin even at such a time. He then beheld in<br>the midst of that forest a lordly tree, blue as the clouds. It was the<br>resort of myriads of birds desirous of shade and shelter. It seemed to<br>have been placed there by the Creator for the good of all creatures like<br>a good man in the world. Soon the sky cleared and became spangled with<br>myriads of stars, presenting the aspect of a magnificent lake smiling<br>with blooming lilies. Turning his eyes towards the clear firmament rich<br>with stars, the fowler began to advance, still trembling with cold.<br>Beholding the sky cleared of clouds, he cast his eyes on all sides and<br>seeing that night was already upon him, he began to think, 'My home is at<br>great distance from where I am.' He then resolved to pass the night under<br>the shade of that tree. Bowing down to it with joined hands, he addressed<br>that monarch of the forest, saying, 'I am a suppliant for the shelter<br>unto all the deities that have this tree for their resort.' Having said<br>these words, he spread some leaves for a bed, and laid himself down on<br>it, resting his head on a stone. Though overwhelmed with affliction, the<br>man soon fell asleep.'"
