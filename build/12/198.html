                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me what description of hell is obtained by a<br>Reciter? I feel, O king, a curiosity to know this. It behoveth thee to<br>discourse on the subject.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Thou hast sprung from a portion of the god of<br>righteousness. Thou art by nature observant of righteousness. Listen, O<br>sinless one, with undivided attention, to these words resting on<br>righteousness as their basis. Those regions that are owned by the<br>high-souled gods, that are of diverse aspects and colours, of diverse<br>descriptions and productive of diverse fruits, and that are of great<br>excellence, those ears again that: move at the will of the riders, those<br>beautiful mansions and hells, those various pleasure-gardens embellished<br>with golden lotuses, those regions that belong to the four Regents and<br>Sukra and Vrihaspati and the Maruts and Viswedevas and Sadhyas and the<br>Aswins, and the Rudras and the Adityas and the Vasus, and other denizens<br>of heaven, are, O sire, spoken of as hells, when compared with the region<br>of the Supreme Soul. The region last spoken of is without any fear (of<br>change for the worse), uncreate (and therefore, in its true nature),<br>without pain of any kind (such as ignorance and delusion), without any<br>agreeable or disagreeable element, beyond the reach of the three<br>attributes (of Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas), freed from the eight incidents,<br>(viz., the five primal elements, the senses, the: mind, and the<br>intellect), without the three (distinctions between the knower, the<br>known, and act of knowing); freed also from the four attributes (seeing,<br>hearing, thinking, and knowing),[633] without the fourfold causes (of<br>knowledge), without joy and delight and sorrow and disease. Time (in his<br>forms of past, present, and future) arises there for use. Time is not the<br>ruler there. That supreme region is the ruler of Time as also of Heaven.<br>That Reciter who becomes identified with his Soul (by withdrawing<br>everything into it) goes thither. He has, after this, never to feel any<br>sorrow. This region is called Supreme. The other regions (of which I have<br>first spoken) are hell. I have not told thee of all those regions that<br>are called hell. Indeed, in comparison with that foremost of regions all<br>the others are called hell.'
