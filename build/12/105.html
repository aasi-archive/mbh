                            "The sage said, 'If, on the other hand, O Kshatriya, thou thinkest that<br>thou hast any prowess still, I shall discourse to thee about that line of<br>policy which thou mayst adopt for recovering thy kingdom. If thou canst<br>follow that line of policy and seek to exert thyself, thou canst still<br>recover thy prosperity. Listen attentively to all that I say unto thee in<br>detail. If thou canst act according to those counsels, thou mayst yet<br>obtain vast wealth, indeed, thy kingdom and kingly power and great<br>prosperity. If thou likest it, O king, tell me, for then I shall speak to<br>thee of that policy.'<br><br>"The king said, 'Tell me, O holy one, what thou wishest to say. I am<br>willing to hear and act according to thy counsels. Let this my meeting<br>with thee today be fruitful of consequences (to myself).'<br><br>"The sage said, 'Renouncing pride and desire and ire and joy and fear,<br>wait upon thy very foes, humbling thyself and joining thy hands. Do thou<br>serve Janaka the ruler of Mithila, always performing good and pure deeds.<br>Firmly devoted to truth, the king of Videha will certainly give thee<br>great wealth. Thou shalt then become the right arm of that king and<br>obtain the trust of all persons. As a consequence of this, thou shalt<br>then succeed in obtaining many allies possessed of courage and<br>perseverance, pure in behaviour, and free from the seven principal<br>faults. A person of restrained soul and having his senses under control,<br>by adhering to his duties, succeeds in raising himself and gladdening<br>others. Honoured by Janaka possessed of intelligence and prosperity, thou<br>shalt certainly become the right arm of that ruler and enjoy the<br>confidence of all. Having then mustered a large force and held<br>consultations with good ministers, do thou cause disunion among thy foes<br>and, setting them against one another, break them all like a person<br>breaking a vilwa with a vilwa. Or, making peace with the foes of thy foe,<br>destroy the latter's power.[323] Thou shalt then cause thy foe to be<br>attached to such good things as are not easily attainable, to beautiful<br>women and cloths, beds and seats and vehicles, all of very costly kinds,<br>and houses, and birds and animals of diverse species, and juices and<br>perfumes and fruits, so that thy foe may be ruined of himself.[324] If<br>one's foe be thus managed, or if indifference is to be shown towards him,<br>one that is desirous of acting according to good policy, should never<br>suffer that foe to know it at all. Following the behaviour that is<br>approved by the wise, do thou enjoy every kind of pleasure in the<br>dominions of thy foe, and imitating the conduct of the dog, the deer, and<br>the crow, behave, with apparent friendship, towards thy enemies. Cause<br>them to undertake achievements that are mighty and difficult to<br>accomplish. See also that they engage in hostilities with powerful<br>enemies. Drawing their attention to pleasant gardens and costly beds and<br>seats, do thou, by offering such objects of enjoyment, drain thy enemy's<br>treasury. Advising thy enemy to perform sacrifices and make gifts, do<br>thou gratify the Brahmanas. The latter, (having received those presents<br>through thy hands), will do good to thee in return (by performing<br>penances and Vedic rites), and devour thy enemy like wolves. Without<br>doubt, a person of righteous deeds obtains a high end. By such deeds men<br>succeed in earning regions of the most felicity in heaven. If the<br>treasury of thy foes be exhausted (by either righteous or unrighteous<br>deeds), every one of them, O prince of Kosala, may be reduced to<br>subjection. The treasury is the root of felicity in heaven and victory on<br>earth. It is in consequence of their treasuries that the foes enjoy such<br>happiness. The treasury, therefore, should by every means be drained. Do<br>not applaud Exertion in the presence of thy foe but speak highly of<br>Destiny. Without doubt, the man who relies too much on acts appertaining<br>to the worship of the gods soon meets with destruction. Cause thy enemy<br>to perform the great sacrifice called Viswajit and divest him by that<br>means of all his possessions. Through this thy object will be fulfilled.<br>Thou mayst then inform thy enemy of the fact that the best men in his<br>kingdom are being oppressed (with exactions for refilling the exhausted<br>treasury), and indicate some eminent ascetic conversant with the duties<br>of Yoga (who will wean thy foe from all earthly possessions). The enemy<br>will then desire to adopt renunciation and retire into the woods,<br>solicitous of salvation. Thou shall then, with the aid of drugs prepared<br>by boiling highly efficacious herbs and plants, and of artificial salts,<br>destroy the elephants and steeds and men (of thy enemy's dominions).<br>These and many other well-devised schemes are available, all connected<br>with fraud. An intelligent person can thus destroy the population of a<br>hostile kingdom with poison.'"
