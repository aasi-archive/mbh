                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandfather, what food is clean and what<br>unclean, what gift is praiseworthy, and who should be considered<br>deserving and who undeserving (of gifts).'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'In this connection is cited the old account of a discourse<br>between the ascetics and that lord of creation, viz., Manu. In the Krita<br>age, an assembly of Rishis, of rigid vows, having approached the great<br>and puissant lord of creation, Manu, while seated at his ease, solicited<br>him to discourse on duties, saying, 'What food should be taken, who is to<br>be regarded a deserving person (for gifts), what gifts should be made,<br>how should a person study, and what penances should one perform and how,<br>and what acts should be done and what acts should not be done, O lord of<br>creation, tell us everything about all this.' Thus addressed by them, the<br>divine and self-born Manu said unto them, 'Listen to me as I expound the<br>duties in brief and in detail. In regions which have not been<br>interdicted, silent recitation (of sacred mantras, homa), fasts,<br>knowledge of self, sacred rivers, regions inhabited by men devoted to<br>this pious acts,&#8212;these have been laid down as acts and objects that are<br>cleansing. Certain mountains also are cleansing, as also the eating of<br>gold and bathing in waters into which have been dipped gems and precious<br>stones. Sojourn to holy places, and eating of sanctified butter&#8212;these<br>also, without doubt speedily cleanse a man. No man would ever be called<br>wise if he is indulged in pride. If he wishes to be long-lived, he should<br>for three nights drink hot water (as an expiation for having indulged in<br>pride). Refusal to appropriate what is not given, gift, study (of<br>scriptures), penance, abstention from injury, truth, freedom from wrath,<br>and worship of the gods in sacrifices,&#8212;these are the characteristics of<br>virtue. That again which is virtue may, according to time and place, be<br>sin. Thus appropriation (of what belongs to others), untruth, and injury<br>and killing, may under special circumstances, become virtue. With respect<br>to persons capable of judging, acts are of two kinds, viz., virtuous and<br>sinful. From the worldly and the Vedic points of view again, virtue and<br>sin are good or bad (according to their consequences). From the Vedic<br>point of view, virtue and sin (i.e., everything a man may do or not do),<br>would be classed under action and inaction. Inaction (i.e., abstention<br>from Vedic rites and adoption of a life of contemplation) leads to<br>emancipation (from rebirth); while the consequences of action (i.e.,<br>practice of Vedic rites) are repeated death and rebirth. From the worldly<br>point of view, acts that are evil lead to evil and those that are good to<br>consequences that are good. From the worldly point of view, therefore,<br>virtue and sin are to be distinguished by the good and the evil character<br>of their consequences.[118] Acts that are (apparently) evil, when<br>undertaken from considerations connected with the gods, the scriptures,<br>life itself, and the means by which life is sustained, produce<br>consequences that are good. When an act is undertaken from the<br>expectation, however doubtful, that it will produce mischief (to some<br>one) in the future, or when an act is done whose consequence is visibly<br>mischievous, expiation has been laid down. When an act is done from wrath<br>or clouded judgment, then expiation should be performed by giving pain to<br>the body, guided by precedent, by scriptures, and by reason. When<br>anything, again, is done for pleasing or displeasing the mind, the sin<br>arising therefrom may be cleansed by sanctified food and recitation of<br>mantras. The king who lays aside (in a particular case) the rod of<br>chastisement, should fast for one night. The priest who (in a particular<br>case) abstains from advising the king to inflict punishment, should fast<br>for three nights as an expiation. The person who, from grief, attempts to<br>commit suicide by means of weapons, should fast for three nights. There<br>is no expiation for them that cast off the duties and practices of their<br>order and class, country, and family, and that abandon their very creed.<br>When an occasion for doubt respecting what should be done arises, that<br>should be regarded as the injunction of the scriptures which ten persons<br>versed in Vedic scriptures or three of those that frequently recite them<br>may declare.[119] The bull, earth, little ants, worms generated in dirt,<br>and poison, should not be eaten by Brahmanas. They should not also eat<br>fishes that have no scales, and four-footed aquatic animals like frogs<br>and others, except the tortoise. Water-fowls called Bhasas, ducks,<br>Suparnas, Chakravakas, diving ducks, cranes, crows, shags, vultures,<br>hawks, owls, as also all four-footed animals that are carnivorous and<br>that have sharp and long teeth, and birds, and animals having two teeth<br>and those having four teeth, as also the milk of the sheep, the she-ass,<br>the she-camel, the newly-calved cow, woman and deer, should not be taken<br>by a Brahmana. Besides this, the food that has been offered to the man,<br>that which has been cooked by a woman who has recently brought forth a<br>child, and food cooked by an unknown person, should not be eaten. The<br>milk also of a cow that has recently calved should not be taken. If a<br>Brahmana takes food that has been cooked by a Kshatriya, it diminishes<br>his energy; if he takes the food provided by a Sudra, it dims his<br>Brahmanic lustre; and if he takes the food provided by a goldsmith or a<br>woman who has neither husband nor children it lessens the period of his<br>life. The food provided by a usurer is equivalent to dirt, while that<br>provided by a woman living by prostitution is equivalent to semen. The<br>food also provided by persons that tolerate the unchastity of their<br>wives, and by persons that are ruled by their spouses, is forbidden. The<br>food provided by a person selected (for receiving gifts) at a certain<br>stage of a sacrifice, by one who does not enjoy his wealth or make any<br>gifts, that provided by one who sells Soma, or one who is a shoe-maker,<br>by an unchaste woman, by a washerman, by a physician, by persons serving<br>as watchmen, by a multitude of persons, by one who is pointed at by a<br>whole village, by one deriving his support from keep of dancing girls, by<br>persons wedding before their elder brothers are wedded, by professional<br>panegyrists and bards, and by those that are gamblers, the food also<br>which is brought with the left hand or which is stale, the food which is<br>mixed with alcohol, the food a portion of which has been already tasted,<br>and the food that forms the remnant of a feast, should not be taken (by a<br>Brahmana). Cakes, sugarcanes, potherbs, and rice boiled in sugared milk,<br>if they have lost their relish, should not be taken. The powder of fried<br>barley and of other kinds of fried grain, mixed with curds, if become<br>stale with age, should not be taken. Rice boiled in sugared milk, food<br>mixed with the tila seed, meat, and cakes, that have not been dedicated<br>to the gods, should not be taken by Brahmanas leading a domestic mode of<br>life, Having first gratified the gods, Rishis, guests, Pitris, and the<br>household deities, a Brahmana leading a domestic mode of life should then<br>take his food. A householder by living thus in his own house becomes like<br>a person of the Bhikshu order that has renounced the world. A man of such<br>behaviour, living with his wives in domesticity, earns great religious<br>merit. No one should make a gift for the sake of acquiring fame, or from<br>fear (of censure and the like) or unto a benefactor. A virtuous man would<br>not make gifts unto persons living by singing and dancing or unto those<br>that are professional jesters, or unto a person that is intoxicated, or<br>unto one that is insane, or unto a thief, or unto a slanderer, or unto an<br>idiot, or unto one that is pale of hue, or unto one that is defective of<br>a limb, or unto a dwarf, or unto a wicked person, or unto one born in a<br>low and wicked family, or unto one that has not been sanctified by the<br>observance of vows. No gift should be made to a Brahmana destitute of<br>knowledge of the Vedas. Gifts should be made unto him only that is a<br>Srotriya.[120] An improper gift and an improper acceptance produce evil<br>consequences unto both the giver and the acceptor. As a person who seeks<br>to cross the ocean with the aid of a rock or a mass of catechu sinks<br>along with his support, even so the giver and the acceptor (in such a<br>case) both sink together. As a fire that is covered with wet fuel does<br>not blaze forth, even so the acceptor of a gift who is bereft of penances<br>and study and piety cannot confer any benefit (upon the giver). As water<br>in a (human skull) and milk in a bag made of dog-skin become unclean in<br>consequence of the uncleanliness of the vessels in which they are kept<br>even so the Vedas become fruitless in a person who is not of good<br>behaviour. One may give from compassion unto a low Brahmana who is<br>without mantras and vows, who is ignorant of the scriptures and who<br>harbours envy. One may, from compassion, give unto a person that is poor<br>or afflicted or ill. But he should not give unto such a person in the<br>belief that he would derive any (spiritual) benefit from it or that he<br>would earn any religious merit by it. There is no doubt that a gift made<br>to Brahmana bereft of the Vedas becomes perfectly fruitless in<br>consequence of the fault of the recipient. As an elephant made of wood or<br>an antelope made of leather, even so is a Brahmana that has not studied<br>the Vedas. All the three have nothing but names.[121] As a eunuch is<br>unproductive with women, as a cow is unproductive with a cow, as a bird<br>lives in vain that is featherless, even so is a Brahmana that is without<br>mantras. As grain without kernel, as a well without water, as libations<br>poured on ashes, even so is a gift to a Brahmana void of learning. An<br>unlearned Brahmana is an enemy (to all) and is the destroyer of the food<br>that is presented to the gods and Pitris. A gift made to such a person<br>goes for nothing. He is, therefore, like unto a robber (of other people's<br>wealth). He can never succeed in acquiring regions of bliss hereafter. I<br>have now told thee in brief, O Yudhishthira, all that was said (by Manu<br>on that occasion). This high discourse should be listened to by all, O<br>bull of Bharata's race.'"
