                            "Bhishma said, 'Thus addressed by the intelligent Tuladhara on that<br>occasion, Jajali of great intelligence, that foremost of ascetics, said<br>these words unto him.'<br><br>"Jajali said, 'Thou sellest all kinds of juices and scents, O son of a<br>trader, as also (barks and leaves of) large trees and herbs and their<br>fruits and roots. "How hast thou succeeded in acquiring a certitude or<br>stability of understanding? Whence hath this knowledge come to thee? O<br>thou of great intelligence, tell me all this in detail.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by that Brahmana possessed of I great<br>fame, Tuladhara of the Vaisya order, well-acquainted with the truths<br>touching the interpretations of morality and contented with knowledge,<br>discoursed to Jajali who had undergone severe penances, upon the ways of<br>morality.[1144]<br><br>"Tuladhara said, 'O Jajali, I know morality, which is eternal, with all<br>its mysteries. It is nothing else than that ancient morality which is<br>known to all, and which consists of universal friendliness, and is<br>fraught with beneficence to all creatures.[1145] That mode of living<br>which is founded upon a total harmlessness towards all creatures or (in<br>case of actual necessity) upon a minimum of such harm, is the highest<br>morality. I live according to that mode, O Jajali! This my house hath<br>been built with wood and grass cut by other people's hands. Lac dye, the<br>roots of Nymphaea lotus, filaments of the lotus, diverse kinds of good<br>scents[1146] and many kinds of liquids, O regenerate Rishi, with the<br>exception of wines, I purchase from other people's hand and sell without<br>cheating. He, O Jajali, is said to know what morality or righteousness<br>is, who is always the friend of all creatures and who is always engaged<br>in the good of all creatures, in thought, word, and deed. I never solicit<br>any one. I never quarrel with any one, I never cherish aversion for any<br>one. I never cherish desire for anything. I cast equal eyes upon all<br>things and all creatures. Behold, O Jajali, this is my vow! My scales are<br>perfectly even, O Jajali, with respect to all creatures.[1147] I neither<br>praise nor blame the acts of others, viewing this variety in the world, O<br>foremost of Brahmanas, to be like the variety observable in the<br>sky.[1148] Know, O Jajali, that I cast equal eye upon all creatures. O<br>foremost of intelligent men, I see no difference between a clod of earth<br>a piece of stone, and a lump of gold. As the blind, the deaf, and they<br>that are destitute of reason, are perfectly consoled for the loss of<br>their senses, after the same manner am I consoled, by their example (for<br>the enjoyments I abstain from).[1149] As they that are overtaken by<br>decrepitude, they that are afflicted by disease, and they that are<br>weakened and emaciated, have no relish for enjoyments of any kind, after<br>the same manner have I ceased to feel any relish for wealth or pleasure<br>or enjoyments. When a person fears nothing and himself is not feared,<br>when he cherishes no desire and hath no aversion for anything, he is then<br>said to attain to Brahma. When a person does not conduct himself sinfully<br>towards any creature in thought, word, or deed, then is he said to attain<br>to Brahma. There is no past, no future. There is no morality or<br>righteousness. He who is not an object of fear with any creature succeeds<br>in attaining to a state in which there is no fear.[1150] On the other<br>hand, that person who for harshness of speech and severity of temper, is<br>a source of trouble unto all creatures even as death itself, certainly<br>attains to a state which abounds with fear. I follow the practices of<br>high-souled and benevolent men of advanced years who with their children<br>and children's children live in the due observance of the ordinance laid<br>down in the scriptures.[1151] The eternal practices (laid down in the<br>Vedas) are entirely given up by one who suffers himself to be stupefied<br>by some errors that he may have noticed in the conduct of those that are<br>admittedly good and wise. One, however, that is endued with learning, or<br>one that has subdued one's senses, or one that is possessed of strength<br>of mind, succeeds in attaining to Emancipation, guided by that very<br>conduct.[1152] That wise man who, having restrained his senses,<br>practiseth, with a heart cleansed from all desire of injuring others, the<br>conduct that is followed by those called good, is sure, O Jajali, to<br>acquire the merit of righteousness (and Emancipation which is its<br>fruits). In this world, as in a river, a piece of wood that is being<br>borne away by the current as it pleases, is seen to come into contact<br>(for some time) with another piece that is being similarly borne away.<br>There, on the current, other pieces of wood that had been joined<br>together, are seen again to separate from one another. Grass, sticks, and<br>cowdung cakes are seen to be united together. This union is due to<br>accident and not to purpose or design.[1153] He of whom no creature is<br>frightened in the least is himself, O ascetic, never frightened by any<br>creature. He, on the other hand, O learned man, of whom every creature is<br>frightened as of a wolf, becomes himself filled with fear as aquatic<br>animals when forced to leap on the shore from fear of the roaring Vadava<br>fire.[1154] This practice of universal harmlessness hath arisen even<br>thus. One may follow it by every means in one's power. He who has<br>followers and he who has wealth may seek to adopt it. It is sure to lead<br>also to prosperity and heaven.[1155] Inconsequence of their ability to<br>dispel the fears of others, men possessed of wealth and followers are<br>regarded as foremost by the learned. They that are for ordinary happiness<br>practise this duty of universal harmlessness for the sake of fame; while<br>they that are truly skilled, practise the same for the sake of attaining<br>to Brahma.[1156] Whatever fruits one enjoys by penances, by sacrifices,<br>by practising liberality, by speaking the truth, and by paying court to<br>wisdom, may all be had by practising the duty of harmlessness. That<br>person who gives unto all creatures the assurance of harmlessness obtains<br>the merit of all sacrifices and at last wins fearlessness for himself as<br>his reward. There is no duty superior to the duty of abstention from<br>injuring other creatures. He of whom, O great ascetic, no creature is<br>frightened in the least, obtains for himself fearlessness of all<br>creatures. He of whom everybody is frightened as one is of a snake<br>ensconced within one's (sleeping) chamber, never acquires any merit in<br>this world or in the next. The very gods, in their search after it,<br>become stupefied in the track of that person who transcends all states,<br>the person, viz., who constitutes himself the soul of all creatures and<br>who looketh upon all creatures as identical with his own self.[1157] Of<br>all gifts, the assurance of harmlessness to all creatures is the highest<br>(in point of merit). I tell thee truly, believe me, O Jajali! One who<br>betakes himself to acts at first wins prosperity, but then (upon the<br>exhaustion of his merit) he once more encounters adversity. Beholding the<br>destruction of (the merits of) acts, the wise do not applaud acts. There<br>is no duty, O Jajali, that is not prompted by some motive (of happiness).<br>Duty, however, is very subtile. Duties have been laid down in the Vedas<br>for the sake of both Brahma and heaven.[1158] The subject of duties hath<br>many secrets and mysteries. It is so subtile that it is not easy to<br>understand it fully. Amongst diverse conflicting ordinances, some succeed<br>in comprehending duty by observing the acts of the good.[1159] Why dost<br>thou not consume them that emasculate bulls and bore their noses and<br>cause them to bear heavy burthens and bind them and put them under<br>diverse kinds of restraint, and that eat the flesh of living creatures<br>after slaying them? Men are seen to own men as slaves, and by beating, by<br>binding, and by otherwise subjecting them to restraints, cause them to<br>labour day and night. These people are not ignorant of the pain that<br>results from beating and fastening in chains.[1160] In every creature<br>that is endued with the five senses live all the deities. Surya,<br>Chandramas, the god of wind, Brahman, Prana, Kratu, and Yama (these dwell<br>in living creatures), There are men that live by trafficking in living<br>creatures! When they earn a living by such a sinful course, what scruples<br>need they feel in selling dead carcases? The goat is Agni. The sheep is<br>Varuna. The horse is Surya. Earth is the deity Virat. The cow and the<br>calf are Soma. The man who sells these can never obtain success. But what<br>fault can attach to the sale of oil, or of Ghrita, or honey, or drugs, O<br>regenerate one? There are many animals that grow up in ease and comfort<br>in places free from gnats and biting insects. Knowing that they are loved<br>dearly by their mothers, men persecute them in diverse ways, and lead<br>them into miry spots abounding with biting insects. Many draft animals<br>are oppressed with heavy burthens. Others, again, are made to languish in<br>consequence of treatment not sanctioned by the scriptures. I think that<br>such acts of injury done to animals are in no way distinguished from<br>foeticide. People regard the profession of agriculture to be sinless.<br>That profession, however, is certainly fraught with cruelty. The<br>iron-faced plough wounds the soil and many creatures that live in the<br>soil. Cast thy eyes, O Jajali, on those bullocks yoked to the plough.<br>Kine are called in the Srutis the Unslayable. That man perpetrates a<br>great sin who slays a bull or a cow.[1161] In days of yore, many Rishis<br>with restrained senses addressed Nahusha, saying, 'Thou hast, O king,<br>slain a cow which is declared in the scriptures to be like unto one's<br>mother. Thou hast also slain a bull, which is declared to be like unto<br>the Creator himself.[1162] Thou hast perpetrated an evil act, O Nahusha,<br>and we have been exceedingly pained at it.' For cleansing Nahusha,<br>however, they divided that sin into a hundred and one parts and<br>converting the fragments into diseases cast them among all<br>creatures.[1163] Thus, O Jajali, did those highly-blessed Rishis cast<br>that sin on all living creatures, and addressing Nahusha who had been<br>guilty of foeticide, said, 'We shall not be able to pour libations in thy<br>sacrifice.' Thus said those high-souled Rishis and Yatis conversant with<br>the truths of all things, having ascertained by their ascetic power that<br>king Nahusha had not been intentionally guilty of that sin.[1164] These,<br>O Jajali, are some of the wicked and dreadful practices that are current<br>in this world. Thou practisest them because they are practised by all men<br>from ancient times, and not because they agree with the dictates of thy<br>cleansed understanding. One should practise what one considers to be<br>one's duty, guided by reasons, instead of blindly following the practices<br>of the world. Listen now, O Jajali, as to what my behaviour is towards<br>him that injures and him that praises me. I regard both of them in the<br>same light. I have none whom I like and none whom I dislike. The wise<br>applauded such a course of conduct as consistent with duty or religion.<br>Even this course of conduct, which is consistent with reasons, is<br>followed by Yatis. The righteous always observe it with eyes possessed of<br>improved vision.'"
