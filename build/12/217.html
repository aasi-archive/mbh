                            "Bhishma said, 'He cannot be said to know Brahma who does not know the<br>four topics (viz., dreams, dreamless slumber, Brahma as indicated by<br>attributes, and Brahma as transcending all attributes), as also what is<br>Manifest (viz., the body), and what is Unmanifest (the chit-soul), which<br>the great Rishi  (Narayana) has described as Tattwam.[776] That which is<br>manifest should be known as liable to death. That which is unmanifest<br>(viz., the chit-soul), should be known as transcending death. The Rishi<br>Narayana has described the religion of Pravritti. Upon that rests the<br>whole universe with its mobile and immobile creatures. The religion of<br>Nivritti again leads to the unmanifest and eternal Brahma.[777] The<br>Creator (Brahma) has described the religion of Pravritti. Pravritti<br>implies rebirth or return. Nivritti, on the other hand, implies the<br>highest end. The ascetic who desires to discriminate with exactitude<br>between good and evil, who is always bent on understanding the nature of<br>the Soul, and who devotes himself to the religion of Nivritti, attains to<br>that high end.[778] One desirous of accomplishing this, should know both<br>the Unmanifest and Purusha of which I shall speak presently. That, again,<br>which is different from both the Unmanifest and Purusha, and which<br>transcends them both, and which is distinguished from all beings, should<br>be particularly viewed by one possessed of intelligence.[779] Both<br>Prakriti and Purusha are without beginning and without end. Both are<br>incapable of being known by their like. Both are eternal and<br>indestructible. Both are greater than the greatest (of being). In these<br>they are similar. They are points of dissimilarity again between them.<br>(Of these I shall speak presently). Prakriti is fraught with the three<br>attributes (of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness). It is also engaged in<br>creation. The true attributes of Kshetrajna (Purusha or the Soul) should<br>be known to be different.[780] Purusha is the apprehender of all the<br>transformations of Prakriti (but cannot be apprehended himself). He<br>transcends (in respect of his original nature) all attributes. As regards<br>Purusha and the Supreme Soul again, both of them are in-comprehensible.<br>In consequence again of both of them being without attributes by which<br>they can be distinguished, both are highly distinguished from all<br>else.[781] A turbaned person has his head circled with three folds of a<br>piece of cloth. (The person, however, is not identical with the turban he<br>wears). After the same manner the embodied Soul is invested with the<br>three attributes of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness. But though thus<br>invested, the Soul is not identical with those attributes. Hence these<br>four topics, which are covered by these fourfold considerations, should<br>be understood.[782] One who understands all this is never stupefied when<br>one has to draw conclusions (in respect of all subjects of enquiry). He<br>that is desirous of attaining to high prosperity should become pure in<br>mind, and betaking himself to austere practices in respect of the body<br>and the senses, should devote himself to yoga without desire of fruits.<br>The universe is pervaded by yoga power secretly circulating through every<br>part of it and illumining it brightly. The sun and the moon shine with<br>effulgence in the firmament of the heart in consequence of yoga power.<br>The result of yoga is Knowledge. Yoga is talked of very highly in the<br>world.[783] Whatever acts are destructive of Passion and Darkness<br>constitute yoga in respect of its real character. Brahmacharya and<br>abstention from injury are said to constitute yoga of the body; while<br>restraining mind and speech properly are said to constitute yoga of the<br>mind. The food that is obtained in alms from regenerate persons<br>conversant with the ritual is distinguished from all other food. By<br>taking that food abstemiously, one's sins born of Passion begin to fade.<br>A yogin subsisting upon such food finds his senses gradually withdrawn<br>from their objects. Hence, he should take only that measure of food which<br>is strictly necessary for the support of his body. (Another advice that<br>may be offered is that) that knowledge which one obtains gradually by<br>mind devoted to yoga should cheerfully be made one's own during one's<br>last moments by a forcible stretch of power.[784] The embodied Soul, when<br>divested of Rajas (does not immediately attain to Emancipation but)<br>assumes a subtile form with all the senses of perception and moves about<br>in space. When his mind becomes unaffected by acts, he, in consequence of<br>such renunciation (loses that subtile form and) becomes merged in<br>Prakriti (without however, yet attaining to Brahma or Emancipation which<br>transcends Prakriti).[785] After the destruction of this gross body, one<br>who through absence of heedlessness escapes from all the three bodies<br>(viz., the gross, the subtile and the karana) succeeds in attaining to<br>Emancipation.[786] The birth and death of creatures always depend upon<br>the cause constituted by original Ignorance (or Avidya). When knowledge<br>of Brahma arises, necessity no longer pursues the person. Those, however,<br>that accept what is the reverse of truth (by believing that to be Self<br>which is really not-Self) are men whose understandings are always taken<br>up with the birth and death of all existent things. (Such people never<br>dream even of Emancipation).[787] Supporting their bodies by aid of<br>patience, withdrawing their hearts from all external objects by the aid<br>of their understanding, and withdrawing themselves from the world of<br>senses, some yogins adore the senses in consequence of their<br>subtility.[788] Some amongst them, with mind cleansed by yoga, proceeding<br>according to (the stages indicated in) the scriptures and reaching the<br>highest, succeed in knowing it by the aid of the understanding and dwell<br>in that which is the highest and which without resting on any other thing<br>rests on itself.[789] Some worship Brahma in images. Some worship Him as<br>existing with attributes. Some repeatedly realise the highest Divinity<br>which has been described to be like a flash of lightning and which is<br>again indestructible.[790] Others who have burnt their sins by penances,<br>attain to Brahma in the end. All those high-souled persons attain to the<br>highest end. With the eye of scripture one should observe the subtile<br>attributes of these several forms, as distinguished by attributes, of<br>Brahma that are (thus) worshipped by men. The yogin who has transcended<br>the necessity of depending on the body, who has cast off all attachments,<br>and whose mind is devoted to yoga abstraction, should be known as another<br>instance of Infinity, as the Supreme Divinity, or as that which it<br>Unmanifest.[791] They whose hearts are devoted to the acquisition of<br>knowledge succeed first in freeing themselves from the world of mortals.<br>Subsequently, by casting off attachments they partake of the nature of<br>Brahma and at last attain to the highest end.<br><br>"Thus have persons conversant with the Vedas spoken of the religion that<br>leads to the attainment of Brahma. They who follow that religion<br>according to the measure of their knowledge all succeed in obtaining the<br>highest end. Even those persons who succeed in acquiring knowledge that<br>is incapable of being shaken (by the assaults of scepticism) and that<br>makes its possessors free from attachments of every kind, attain to<br>various high regions after death and become emancipated according to the<br>measure of their knowledge. Those persons of pure hearts who have imbibed<br>contentment from knowledge, and who have cast off all desires and<br>attachments, gradually approach in respect of their nature, nearer and<br>nearer to Brahma which has the unmanifest for his attribute, which is<br>divine, and without birth and death. Realising that Brahma dwells in<br>their Souls, they become themselves immutable and have never to return<br>(to the earth). Attaining to that supreme state which is indestructible<br>and eternal, they exist in felicity. The knowledge with respect to this<br>world is even this: it exists (in the case of erring persons). It does<br>not exist (in the case of those who have not been stupefied by error).<br>The whole universe, bound up in desire, is revolving like a wheel. As the<br>fibres of a lotus-stalk overspread themselves into every part of the<br>stalk, after the same manner the fibres of desire, which have neither<br>beginning nor end, spread themselves over every part of the body. As a<br>weaver drives his threads into a cloth by means of his shuttle, after the<br>same manner the threads that constitute the fabric of the universe are<br>woven by the shuttle of Desire. He who properly knows transformations of<br>Prakriti, Prakriti herself and Purusha, becomes freed from Desire and<br>attains to Emancipation.[792] The divine Rishi Narayana, that refuge of<br>the universe, for the sake of compassion towards all creatures, clearly<br>promulgated these means for the acquisition of immortality.'"
