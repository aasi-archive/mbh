                            "Bhishma said, 'Once on a time a king of Janaka's race, while ranging the<br>uninhabited forests in pursuit of deer, saw a superior Brahmana or Rishi<br>of Bhrigu's race. Bowing with his head unto the Rishi who was seated at<br>his ease, king Vasuman took his seat near him and obtaining his<br>permission put to him this question: O holy one, what is productive of<br>the highest benefit, both here and hereafter, to man who is endued with<br>an unstable body and who is the slave of his desires? Properly honoured<br>by the king, and thus questioned, that high-souled Rishi possessed of<br>ascetic merit then said these words unto him that were highly beneficial.<br><br>"The Rishi said, If thou desirest both here and hereafter what is<br>agreeable to thy mind, do thou then, with restrained senses, abstain from<br>doing what is disagreeable to all creatures. Righteousness is beneficial<br>unto them that are good. Righteousness is the refuge of those that are<br>good. From Righteousness have flowed the three worlds with their mobile<br>and immobile creatures. O thou that art eagerly desirous of enjoying all<br>agreeable objects, how is it that thou art not yet satiated with objects<br>of desire? Thou seest the honey, O thou of little understanding, but art<br>blind to the fall[1638]. As one desirous of earning the fruits of<br>knowledge should set oneself to the acquisition of knowledge, even so one<br>desirous of earning the fruits of Righteousness should set oneself to the<br>acquisition of Righteousness. If a wicked man from desire of virtue,<br>strives to accomplish an act that is pure and stainless, the fulfilment<br>of his desire becomes impossible. If, on the other hand, a good man,<br>impelled by the desire of earning virtue, strives to accomplish an act<br>that is even difficult, its accomplishment becomes easy for him. If,<br>while residing in the woods, one acts in such a way as to enjoy all the<br>pleasures of a residence amidst men in towns, one comes to be looked upon<br>not as a forest recluse but as a denizen of towns. Similarly, if one,<br>while residing in towns, acts in such a way as to enjoy the felicity that<br>attaches to the life of a forest recluse, once comes to be looked upon<br>not as a denizen of towns but as a forest recluse. Ascertaining the<br>merits of the religion of Acts and that of Abstention from acts, do thou,<br>with concentrated senses, be devoted to the practices of righteousness<br>that appertain to thought, words, and deed. Judging of the propriety of<br>time and place, purified by the observance of vows and other cleansing<br>rites, and solicited (by them), do thou, without malice, make large gifts<br>unto them that are good.[1639] Acquiring wealth by righteous means, one<br>should give it away unto those that are deserving. One should make gifts,<br>casting off anger; and having made gifts one should never give way to<br>sorrow nor proclaim those gifts with one's own mouth. The Brahmana who is<br>full of compassion, who is observant of candour, and whose birth is pure,<br>has been regarded as a person deserving of gifts. A person is said to be<br>pure in birth when he is born of mother that has only one husband and<br>that belongs to the same order to which her husband belongs. Indeed, such<br>a Brahmana, conversant with the three Vedas, viz., Rich, Yajush, and<br>Saman, possessed of learning, duly observant of the six duties (of<br>sacrificing on his own account, officiating at the sacrifices of others,<br>learning, teaching, making gifts, and receiving gifts), has been regarded<br>as deserving of gifts. Righteousness becomes unrighteousness, and<br>unrighteousness becomes righteousness, according to the character of the<br>doer, of time, and of place.[1640] Sin is cast off like the filth on<br>one's body,&#8212;a little with a little exertion and a greater quantity when<br>the exertion is greater. A person, after purging his bowels, should take<br>ghee, which operates most beneficially on his system (as a healthy<br>tonic). After the same manner, when one has cleansed oneself of all<br>faults and sets oneself to the acquisition of righteousness, that<br>righteousness, in the next world, proves to be productive of the highest<br>happiness. Good and evil thoughts exist in the minds of all creatures.<br>Withdrawing the mind from evil thoughts, it should always be directed<br>towards good thoughts. One should always reverence the practices of one's<br>own order. Do thou strive, therefore, to act in such a way that thou<br>mayst have faith in the practices of thy own order. O thou that art<br>endued with an impatient soul, betake thyself to the practice of<br>patience. O thou that art of a foolish understanding, seek thou to be<br>possessed of intelligence! Destitute of tranquillity, seek thou to be<br>tranquil, and bereft of wisdom as thou art, do thou seek to act wisely!<br>He who moves in the companionship of the righteous succeeds, by his own<br>energy, in acquiring the means of accomplishing what is beneficial for<br>him both in this and the next world. Verily, the root of the benefit<br>(which thus becomes his here and hereafter) is unwavering firmness. The<br>royal sage Mahabhisha, through want of this firmness, fell from heaven.<br>Yayati, also, though his merits had become exhausted (in consequence of<br>his boastfulness and thought was hurled down from heaven) succeeded in<br>regaining regions of felicity through his firmness. Thou art sure to<br>attain to great intelligence, as also to what is for thy highest good, by<br>paying court to virtuous and learned persons possessed of ascetic merit.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Hearing these words of the sage, king Vasuman,<br>possessed of a good disposition, withdrawing his mind from the pursuits<br>of desire, set it upon the acquisition of Righteousness.'"
