                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, what and of what nature is<br>that which is called by the name of Adhyatma and which is laid down for<br>every person.[600] O thou that art acquainted with Brahma, whence has<br>this universe consisting of mobile and immobile things, been created?<br>When universal destruction sets in, to whom does it go? It behoveth thee<br>to discourse to me upon this topic.'[601]<br><br>"Bhishma said 'This, Adhyatma, O son of Pritha, that thou askest me<br>about, I will presently discourse upon. It is highly agreeable and<br>productive of great felicity. Great teachers have (before this) show the<br>truths about Creation and the Destruction (of the universe). Knowing<br>those truths, a person may obtain, even in this world, great satisfaction<br>and felicity. Such knowledge may lead also to the acquisition of great<br>fruits, and it is highly beneficial to all creatures. Earth, air, space,<br>water, and light numbered as the fifth, are regarded as Great Creatures.<br>These constitute both the origin and the destruction of all created<br>objects. Unto him from whom these great primal elements take their<br>origin, they return repeatedly, severing themselves from all creatures<br>(into whose compositions they enter), even like the waves of the ocean<br>(subsiding into that from which they seem to take their rise). As the<br>tortoise stretches its limbs and withdraws them again, even so the<br>Supreme Soul creates all objects and again withdraws into Himself. The<br>Creator places the five primal elements in all created objects in<br>different proportions. The living creature, however, does not see it<br>(through ignorance). Sound, the organs of hearing, and all holes,&#8212;these<br>three,&#8212;spring from Space as their progenitor. Touch, action, and skin<br>are the triple attributes of the Wind. Form, eye, and digestion are the<br>triple attributes of Fire or Energy. Taste, all liquid secretions, and<br>the tongue represent the three attributes of Water. Scents, the nose, and<br>the body are the triple properties of Earth. The great (primal) elements<br>are five. The mind is the sixth. The senses and the mind, O Bharata, are<br>(the sources of all) the perceptions of a living creature.[602] The<br>seventh is called the understanding; and the eighth is the soul.[603] The<br>senses are for perceiving; the mind (unable to deal with those<br>perceptions) produces uncertainty. The understanding reduces all<br>perceptions to certainty. The Soul exists as a witness (without acting).<br>All that is above the two feet, all that is behind, and all that is<br>above, are seen by the Soul. Know that the Soul pervades the entire being<br>without any space being left unoccupied. All men should know the senses,<br>the mind, and the understanding fully. The three states or qualities<br>called Darkness, Passion, and Goodness, exist, dependent on the senses,<br>the mind, and the understanding.[604] Man, by apprehending with the aid<br>of his intelligence, the manner in which creatures come and leave the<br>world, is sure to gradually attain to steadfast tranquillity. The three<br>qualities (already mentioned, viz., Darkness, Passion, and Goodness),<br>lead the understanding (to worldly attachments). In this respect, the<br>Understanding (or Intelligence) is identical with the Senses and the<br>Mind. The Understanding, therefore, is identical with the six (the five<br>senses and the mind), and also with the objects comprehended by it. When,<br>however, the Understanding is destroyed, the three qualities (of<br>Darkness, Passion, and Goodness) are incapable of leading to action.[605]<br>This universe of immobile and mobile things consists of that<br>intelligence. It is from that Intelligence that everything arises and it<br>is into it that everything subsides. For this reason, the scriptures<br>indicate that everything is a manifestation of Intelligence. That by<br>which one hears is the ear. That by which one smells is called the organ<br>of smell, and that by which one distinguishes the tastes is called the<br>tongue. By the coat that covers the body one acquires perception of<br>touch. That which is called the Intelligence undergoes<br>modifications.[606] When the Intelligence desires anything it comes to be<br>called Mind. The foundations upon which the Intelligence rests are five<br>in number, each serving a different purpose. They are called the senses.<br>The invisible principle, viz., Intelligence rests on them. The<br>Intelligence that exists in a living creature concerns itself with the<br>three states (called Passion, Darkness, and Goodness). Sometimes it<br>obtains joy and sometimes misery. Sometimes it becomes divested of both<br>joy and misery. Even thus the Intelligence exists in the minds of all<br>men. Sometimes the Intelligence which is made up of the triple states<br>(already mentioned), transcends those three states (by yoga), like the<br>lord of rivers, viz., the Ocean, with his surges, transgressing his high<br>continents.[607] That Intelligence which transcends the three qualities<br>exist in the mind in a pure state of (unmodified) existence: alone. The<br>quality of Darkness, however, that impels to action, soon pursues it. At<br>that time, the Intelligence sets all the senses to action. The properties<br>of the three are even thus: joy dwells in Goodness; sorrow in Passion;<br>delusion in Darkness. All the states that exist (of the mind) are<br>included in the three (that have been named). I have now, O Bharata, told<br>thee about the course of the Understanding. An intelligent man should<br>subdue all his senses.. The three qualities of Goodness, Passion, and<br>Darkness, are always attached to living creatures. Three kinds of<br>intelligence also are noticeable in every creature, viz., that which<br>depends upon Goodness, that upon Passion, and that upon Darkness, O<br>Bharata. The quality of Goodness brings happiness; the quality of Passion<br>produces sorrow; and if these two combine with the quality of Darkness,<br>then neither happiness nor sorrow is produced (but, instead, only<br>delusion or error). Every state of happiness that appears in the body or<br>the mind is said to be due to the quality of Goodness. A state of sorrow,<br>disagreeable to oneself', that comes, is due to nothing but the quality<br>of Passion. One should never think of it with fear.[608] That state,<br>again, which is allied with delusion and error, and in consequence of<br>which one knows not what to do, which is unascertainable and unknown,<br>should be regarded as belonging to the quality of Darkness.[609]<br>Gladness, satisfaction, delight, happiness, tranquillity of heart, these<br>are the properties of the state of Goodness. Man sometimes obtains a<br>measure of them. Discontent, heart-burning, grief, cupidity,<br>vindictiveness are all indications of the state of Passion. They are seen<br>with or without adequate causes for producing them. Disgrace, delusion,<br>error, sleep and stupefaction, that overtake one through excess of<br>ill-luck, are the various properties of the state of Darkness.[610] That<br>person whose mind is far-reaching, capable of extending in all<br>directions, mistrustful in respect of winning the objects it desires, and<br>well-restrained, is happy both here and hereafter.[611] Mark the<br>distinction between these two subtile things, viz., Intelligence and<br>Soul. One of these (viz., intelligence), puts forth the qualities. The<br>other (viz., the Soul), does nothing of the kind. A gnat and a fig may be<br>seen to be united with each other. Though united, each however is<br>distinct from the other. Similarly, Intelligence and Soul, though<br>distinguished from each other, by their respective natures, yet they may<br>always be seen to exist in a state of union. A fish and water exist in a<br>state of union, Each, however, is different from the other. The same is<br>the case with Intelligence and Soul. The qualities do not know the Soul,<br>but the Soul knows them all. The Soul is the spectator of the qualities<br>and regards them all as proceeding from itself. The soul, acting through<br>the senses, the mind, and the understanding numbering as the seventh, all<br>of which are inactive and have no self-consciousness, discovers the<br>objects (amid which it exists) like a (covered) lamp showing all objects<br>around it by shedding its rays through an aperture in the covering. The<br>understanding or Intelligence creates all the qualities. The Soul only<br>beholds them (as a witness). Even such is certainly the connection<br>between the intelligence and the Soul.[612] There is no refuge on which<br>either Intelligence or Soul depends. The Understanding creates the mind,<br>but never the qualities. When the soul, by means of the mind,<br>sufficiently restrains the rays that emanate from the senses, it is then<br>that it becomes manifest (to the Understanding) like a lamp burning<br>within a vessel that covers it. That person who renounces all ordinary<br>acts, practises penances, devotes himself to study the Soul, taking a<br>delight therein, and regards himself as the Soul of all creatures,<br>acquires a high end. As an aquatic fowl, while moving over the waters, is<br>never drenched in that element, even thus does a person of wisdom move<br>(in the world) among creatures. By the aid of one's intelligence one<br>should act in the world after this fashion, without grief, without joy,<br>with an equal eye for all, and destitute of malice and envy. One living<br>in this way succeeds in creating the qualities (instead of being oneself<br>affected by them), like a spider creating threads.[613] The qualities<br>should, indeed, be regarded as the threads of the spider. Some say that<br>the qualities in respect of such men are not lost. Some say that they are<br>all lost. Those who say that they are not lost rely upon the revealed<br>scriptures (viz., the Srutis), which do not contain any declaration to<br>the contrary. They, on the other hand, who say that the qualities are all<br>lost rely on the Smritis. Reflecting upon both these opinions, one should<br>judge oneself as to which of them is right. One should thus get over this<br>hard and knotty question which is capable c f disturbing the<br>understanding by doubt, and thereby win happiness. When that doubt will<br>be removed, one will no longer have to indulge in sorrow of any kind. Men<br>of filthy hearts may by knowledge obtain success like persons plunging in<br>a well-filled stream purifying themselves of all filth. One who has to<br>cross a broad river does not feel happy at only seeing the other shore.<br>If the case were otherwise (i.e., if by only beholding the other shore<br>one could reach it by a boat), then might one become happy. The matter is<br>otherwise with one acquainted with the Truth. The mere knowledge of Truth<br>will bring him happiness. As soon as such knowledge begins to bear<br>fruits, the person may be regarded to have reached the other shore. They<br>who thus know the Soul as freed from all worldly objects and is but the<br>One, are said to obtain high and excellent knowledge.[614] A person by<br>knowing the origin and the end of all creatures, which is even such, and<br>by reflecting upon the matter, gradually obtains infinite happiness. He<br>that has understood the triple aggregate (viz., that it is liable to<br>destruction instead of being eternal), and reflecting upon it, casts it<br>away, succeeds by yoga to behold the Truth and obtain perfect felicity.<br>The Soul is incapable of being seen unless the senses, which are employed<br>on diverse objects and are difficult of being controlled, be all duly<br>restrained. He that knows this is really wise. What other indication is<br>there of a wise man? Acquiring this knowledge, men possessed of<br>intelligence regard themselves to be crowned with success. That which<br>inspires the ignorant with fear can never inspire fear in persons of<br>Knowledge. There is no higher end for anybody (than Emancipation). In<br>consequence, however, of the excess or otherwise of good qualities, the<br>sages say that differences are observable in respect of the degree of<br>Emancipation. A person by acting without expectation of fruits succeeds<br>(by those acts) in annihilating his sinful acts of a former period. To<br>one possessed of wisdom, the acts of a former period (thus washed off)<br>and those of this life also (which are accomplished without expectation<br>of fruit), do not become productive of any disagreeable consequence (such<br>as immurement in hell). But how can acts, if he continues to be engaged<br>in accomplishing acts, bring about what is agreeable (viz.,<br>Emancipation)?[615] People censure a person that is afflicted (with lust,<br>envy, and other evil passions). Those vices hurl the person in his next<br>life into diverse kinds of inferior orders.[616] Mark with close<br>attention the vicious in this world who grieve exceedingly for the loss<br>of their possessions (such as sons and wives, etc.). Behold also those<br>that are gifted with judgment and who never grieve when thrown into<br>similar circumstances. Those that are conversant with both (i.e., with<br>gradual Emancipation and immediate Emancipation), deserve to be called<br>truly wise.'"[617]
