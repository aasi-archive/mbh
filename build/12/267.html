                            "Yudhishthira said, 'How, indeed, should the king protect his subjects<br>without injuring anybody. I ask thee this, O grandsire, tell me, O<br>foremost of good men!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative of the<br>conversation between Dyumatsena and king Satyavat. We have heard that<br>upon a certain number of individuals having been brought out for<br>execution at the command of his sire (Dyumatsena), prince Satyavat said<br>certain words that had never before been said by anybody else.[1212]<br>'Sometimes righteousness assumes the form of iniquity, and iniquity<br>assumes the form of righteousness. It can never be possible that the<br>killing of individuals can ever be a righteous act.'<br><br>"Dyumatsena said, 'If the sparing of those that deserve to be slain be<br>righteousness, if robbers be spared, O Satyavat, then all distinctions<br>(between virtue and vice) would disappear. 'This is mine',&#8212;'This (other)<br>is not his'&#8212;ideas like these (with respect to property) will not (if the<br>wicked be not punished) prevail in the Kali age. (If the wicked be not<br>punished) the affairs of the world will come to a deadlock. If thou<br>knowest how the world may go on (without punishing the wicked), then<br>discourse to me upon it.'<br><br>"Satyavat said, 'The three other orders (viz., the Kshatriyas, Vaisyas,<br>and Sudras) should be placed under the control of the Brahmanas. If those<br>three orders be kept within the bonds of righteousness, then the<br>subsidiary classes (that have sprung from intermixture) will imitate them<br>in their practices. Those amongst them that will transgress (the commands<br>of the Brahmanas) shall be reported to the king.&#8212;'This one heeds not my<br>commands,'&#8212;upon such a complaint being preferred by a Brahmana, the king<br>shall inflict punishment upon the offender. Without destroying the body<br>of the offender the king should do that unto him which is directed by the<br>scriptures. The king should not act otherwise, neglecting to reflect<br>properly upon the character of the offence and upon the science of<br>morality. By slaying the wicked, the king (practically) slays a large<br>number of individuals that are innocent. Behold, by slaying a single<br>robber, his wife, mother, father and children are all slain (because they<br>become deprived of the means of life). When injured by a wicked person,<br>the king should, therefore, reflect deeply on the question of<br>chastisement.[1213] Sometimes a wicked man is seen to imbibe good<br>behaviour from a righteous person. Then again from persons that are<br>wicked, good children may be seen to spring. The wicked, therefore,<br>should not be torn up by the roots. The extermination of the wicked is<br>not consistent with eternal practice. By smiting them gently they may be<br>made to expiate their offences. By depriving them of all their wealth, by<br>chains and immurement in dungeons, by disfiguring them (they may be made<br>to expiate their guilt). Their relatives should not be persecuted by the<br>infliction of capital sentences on them. If in the presence of the<br>Purohita and others,[1214] they give themselves up to him from desire of<br>protection, and swear, saying, 'O Brahmana, we shall never again commit<br>any sinful act,' they would then deserve to be let off without any<br>punishment. This is the command of the Creator himself. Even the Brahmana<br>that wears a deer-skin and the wand of (mendicancy) and has his head<br>shaved, should be punished (when he transgresses).[1215] If great men<br>transgress, their chastisement should be proportionate to their<br>greatness. As regards them that offend repeatedly, they do not deserve to<br>be dismissed without punishment as on the occasion of their first<br>offence.'[1216] "Dyumatsena said, 'As long as those barriers within which<br>men should be kept are not transgressed, so long are they designated by<br>the name of Righteousness. If they who transgressed those, barriers were<br>not punished with death, those barriers would soon be destroyed. Men of<br>remote and remoter times were capable of being governed with ease.[1217]<br>They were very truthful (in speech and conduct). They were little<br>disposed to disputes and quarrels. They seldom gave way to anger, or, if<br>they did, their wrath never became ungovernable. In those days the mere<br>crying of fie on offenders was sufficient punishment. After this came the<br>punishment represented by harsh speeches or censures. Then followed the<br>punishment of fines and forfeitures. In this age, however, the punishment<br>of death has become current. The measure of wickedness has increased to<br>such an extent that by slaying one others cannot be restrained.[1218] The<br>robber has no connection with men, with the deities, with the Gandharvas,<br>and with the Pitris. What is he to whom? He is not anybody to any one.<br>This is the declaration of the Srutis.[1219] The robber takes away the<br>ornaments of corpses from cemeteries, and swearing apparel from men<br>afflicted by spirits (and, therefore, deprived of senses). That man is a<br>fool who would make any covenant with those miserable wretches or exact<br>any oath from them (for relying upon it).'[1220]<br><br>"Satyavat said, 'If thou dost not succeed in making honest men of those<br>rogues and in saving them by means unconnected with slaughter, do thou<br>then exterminate them by performing some sacrifice.[1221] Kings practise<br>severe austerities for the sake of enabling their subjects go on<br>prosperously in their avocations. When thieves and robbers multiply in<br>their kingdoms they become ashamed.. They, therefore, betake themselves<br>to penances for suppressing thefts and robberies and making their<br>subjects live happily. Subjects can be made honest by being only<br>frightened (by the king). Good kings never slay the wicked from motives<br>of retribution. (On the other hand, if they slay, they slay in<br>sacrifices, when the motive is to do good to the slain), Good kings<br>abundantly succeed in ruling their subjects properly with the aid of good<br>conduct (instead of cruel or punitive inflictions). If the king acts<br>properly, the superior subjects imitate him. The inferior people, again<br>in their turn, imitate their immediate superiors. Men are so constituted<br>that they imitate those whom they regard as their superiors.[1222] That<br>king who, without restraining himself, seeks to restrain others (from<br>evil ways) becomes an object of laughter with all men in consequence of<br>his being engaged in the enjoyment of all worldly pleasures as a slave of<br>his senses. That man who, through arrogance or error of judgment, offends<br>against the king in any way, should be restrained by every means. It is<br>by this way that he is prevented from committing offences anew. The king<br>should first restrain his own self if he desires to restrain others that<br>offend. He should punish heavily (if necessary) even friends and near<br>relatives. In that kingdom where a vile offender does not meet with heavy<br>afflictions, offences increase and righteousness decreases without doubt.<br>Formerly, a Brahmana. endued with clemency and possessed of learning,<br>taught me this. Verily, to this effect, O sire, I have been instructed by<br>also our grandsire of olden days, who gave such assurances of<br>harmlessness to people, moved by pity. Their words were, 'In the Krita<br>age, kings should rule their subjects by adopting ways that are entirely<br>harmless. In the Treta age, kings conduct themselves according to ways<br>that conform with righteousness fallen away by a fourth from its full<br>complement. In the Dwapara age, they proceed according to ways conforming<br>with righteousness fallen away by a moiety, and in the age that follows,<br>according to ways conforming with righteousness fallen away by<br>three-fourth. When the Kati age sets in, through the wickedness of kings<br>and in consequence of the nature of the epoch itself, fifteen parts of<br>even that fourth portion of righteousness disappear, a sixteenth portion<br>thereof being all that then remains of it. If, O Satyavat, by adopting<br>the method first mentioned (viz., the practice of harmlessness),<br>confusion sets in, the king, considering the period of human life, the<br>strength of human beings, and the nature of the time that has come,<br>should award punishments.[1223] Indeed, Manu, the son of the Self-born,<br>has, through compassion for human beings, indicated the way by means of<br>which men may adhere to knowledge (instead of harmfulness) for the sake<br>of emancipation.'"[1224]
