                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O thou of great wisdom, everything about<br>that from which spring wrath and lust, O bull of Bharata's race, and<br>sorrow and loss of judgment, and inclination to do (evil to others), and<br>jealousy and malice and pride, and envy, and slander, and incapacity to<br>bear the good of others, and unkindness, and fear. Tell me everything<br>truly and in detail about all these.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'These thirteen vices are regarded as very powerful foes<br>of all creatures. These, O Monarch, approach and tempt men from every<br>side. They goad and afflict a heedless man or one that is insensate.<br>Indeed, as soon as they see a person, they assail him powerfully like<br>wolves jumping upon their prey. From these proceed all kinds of grief.<br>From these proceed all kinds of sin. Every mortal, O foremost of men,<br>should always know this. I shall now speak to thee of their origin, of<br>the objects upon which they rest, and of the means of their destruction,<br>O lord of the earth! Listen, first, O king, with undivided attention, to<br>the origin of wrath truly and in detail. Anger springs from covetousness.<br>It is strengthened by the faults of others. Through forgiveness it<br>remains dormant, and through forgiveness it disappears. As regards lust,<br>it springs from resolution. Indulgence strengthens it. When the man of<br>wisdom resolutely turns away from it, it disappears and dies. Envy of<br>others proceeds from between wrath and covetousness. It disappears in<br>consequence of compassion and knowledge of self. In consequence of<br>compassion for all creatures, and of that disregard for all worldly<br>objects (that knowledge brings in its train), it disappears. It also<br>arises from seeing the faults of other people. But in men of intelligence<br>it quickly disappears in consequence of true knowledge.[465] Loss of<br>judgment has its origin in ignorance and proceeds from sinfulness of<br>habit. When the man whom this fault assails begins to take delight in<br>(the company and counsels of) wise men, the vice at once and immediately<br>hides its head. Men, O thou of Kuru's race, see conflicting scriptures.<br>From that circumstance springs the desire for diverse kinds of action.<br>When true Knowledge has been gained, that desire is allayed. The grief of<br>an embodied creature proceeds from affection which is awakened by<br>separation. When, however, one learns that the dead do not return<br>(whatever the grief one may feel for them), it subsides. Incapacity to<br>bear other people's good proceeds from wrath and covetousness. Through<br>compassion for every creature and in consequence of a disregard for all<br>earthly objects, it is extinguished. Malice proceeds from the abandonment<br>of truth and indulgence in wickedness. This vice, O child, disappears in<br>consequence of one's waiting upon the wise and good. Pride, in men,<br>springs from birth, learning, and prosperity. When those three, however,<br>are truly known, that vice instantly disappears. Jealousy springs from<br>lust and delight in low and vulgar people. In consequence of wisdom it is<br>destroyed. From errors (of conduct) inconsistent with the ordinary course<br>of men, and through disagreeable speeches expressive of aversion, slander<br>takes its rise. It disappears, O king, upon a survey of the whole world.<br>When the person that injures is powerful and the injured one is unable to<br>avenge the injury, hate shows itself. It subsides, however, through<br>kindliness. Compassion proceeds from a sight of the helpless and<br>miserable persons with whom the world abounds. That sentiment disappears<br>when one understands the strength of virtue.[466] Covetousness in all<br>creatures spring from ignorance. Beholding the instability of all objects<br>of enjoyment, it suffers destruction. It has been said that tranquillity<br>of soul can alone subdue all these thirteen faults. All these thirteen<br>faults stained the sons of Dhritarashtra. Thyself, always desirous of<br>truth, hast conquered all of those vices in consequence of thy regard for<br>seniors.'"
