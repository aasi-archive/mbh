                            "Bhishma said, 'The fowler, O king, happened to see that pair while<br>seated on their celestial car. Beholding the couple he became filled with<br>sorrow (at the thought of his own misfortune) and began to reflect upon<br>the means of obtaining the same end. And he said to himself, 'I must, by<br>austerities like those of the pigeon, attain to such a high end!' Having<br>formed this resolution, the fowler, who had lived by the slaughter of<br>birds, set out on an unreturning journey. Without any endeavour (for<br>obtaining food) and living upon air alone, he cast off all affections<br>from desire of acquiring heaven. After he had proceeded for some<br>distance, he saw an extensive and delightful lake full of cool and pure<br>water, and adorned with lotuses and teeming with diverse kinds of<br>water-fowl. Without doubt, the very sight of such a lake is capable of<br>slaking the desire for drink of a thirsty person. Emaciated with fasts,<br>the fowler, however, O king, without casting his eyes upon it, gladly<br>penetrated a forest inhabited by beasts of prey, having ascertained<br>previously its wide extent. After he had entered the forest he became<br>much afflicted by sharp pointed thorns. Lacerated and torn by prickles,<br>and covered all over with blood, he began to wander in that forest<br>destitute of men but abounding with animals of diverse species. Sometime<br>after, inconsequence of the friction of some mighty trees caused by a<br>powerful wind, a widespread bush fire arose. The raging element,<br>displaying a splendour like to what it assumes at the end of the Yuga,<br>began to consume that large forest teeming with tall trees and thick<br>bushes and creepers. Indeed, with flames fanned by the wind and myriads<br>of sparks flying about in all directions, the all-consuming deity began<br>to burn that dense forest abounding with birds and beasts. The fowler,<br>desirous of casting off his body, ran with a delighted heart towards that<br>spreading conflagration. Consumed by that fire the fowler became cleansed<br>of all his sins and attained, O best of the Bharatas, to high success.<br>The fever of his heart dispelled, he at last beheld himself in heaven,<br>shining in splendour like Indra in the midst of Yakshas and Gandharvas<br>and persons crowned with ascetic success. Thus, indeed, the pigeon and<br>his devoted spouse, with the fowler, ascended to heaven for their<br>meritorious acts, The woman who thus follows her lord speedily ascends to<br>heaven and shines in splendour there like the she-pigeon of whom I have<br>spoken. Even this is the old history of the high-souled fowler and the<br>pigeon. Even thus did they earn a highly meritorious end by their<br>righteous acts. No evil befalls the persons who listens every day to this<br>story or who recites it every day, even if error invades his mind.[437] O<br>Yudhisthira, O foremost of all righteous persons, the protection of a<br>suppliant is truly a high act of merit. Even the slayer of a cow, by<br>practising this duty, maybe cleansed of sin. That man, however, will<br>never be cleansed who slays a suppliant. By listening to this sacred and<br>sin-cleansing story one becomes freed from distress and attains to heaven<br>at last.'"
