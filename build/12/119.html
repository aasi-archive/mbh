                            "Bhishma said, 'That king who, guided by the lesson to be drawn from the<br>story of the dog, appoints his servants to offices for which each is fit,<br>succeeds in enjoying the happiness that is attached to sovereignty. A dog<br>should not, with honours, be placed in a position above that for which he<br>is fit. If a dog be placed above the situation which is fit for him, he<br>becomes intoxicated with pride. Ministers should be appointed to offices<br>for which they are fit and should possess such qualifications as are<br>needed for their respective occupations. Appointments on unfit persons<br>are not at all approved. That king who confers on his servants offices<br>for which each is fit, succeeds, in consequence of such merit, to enjoy<br>the happiness attaching to sovereignty. A Sarabha should occupy the<br>position of a Sarabha; a lion should swell with the might of a lion; a<br>tiger should be placed in the position of a tiger; and a leopard should<br>be placed as a leopard. Servants should, according to the ordinance, be<br>appointed to offices for which each is fit. If thou wishest to achieve<br>success, thou shouldst never appoint servants in situations higher than<br>what they deserve. That foolish king who, transgressing precedent,<br>appoints servants to offices for which they are not fit, fails to gratify<br>his people. A king that desires to possess accomplished servants should<br>never appoint persons that are destitute of intelligence, that are<br>low-minded, that are without wisdom, that are not masters of their<br>senses, and that are not of high birth. Men that are honest, possessed of<br>high birth, brave, learned, destitute of malice and envy, high-minded,<br>pure in behaviour, and clever in the transaction of business, deserve to<br>be appointed as ministers. Persons that are possessed of humility, ready<br>in the performance of their duties, tranquil in disposition, pure in<br>mind, adorned with diverse other gifts of nature and are never the<br>objects of calumny in respect of the offices they hold should be the<br>intimate associates of the king. A lion should always make a companion of<br>a lion. If one that is not a lion becomes the companion of a lion, one<br>earns all the advantages that belong to a lion. That lion, however who,<br>while engaged in discharging the duties of a lion, has a pack of dogs<br>only for his associates, never succeeds in consequence of such<br>companionship, in accomplishing those duties. Even thus, O ruler of men,<br>may a king succeed in subjugating the whole earth if he has for his<br>ministers men possessed of courage, wisdom, great learning, and high<br>birth. O foremost of royal masters, kings should never entertain a<br>servant that is destitute of learning and sincerity and wisdom and great<br>wealth. These men that are devoted to the services of their master are<br>never slopped by any impediments. Kings should always speak in soothing<br>terms unto those servants that are always engaged in doing good to their<br>masters. Kings should always, with great care, look after their<br>treasuries. Indeed, kings have their roots in their treasuries. A king<br>should always seek to swell his treasury. Let thy barns, O king, be<br>fitted with corn. And let their keep be entrusted to honest servants. Do<br>thou seek to increase thy wealth and corn. Let thy servants, skilled in<br>battle, be always attentive to their duties. It is desirable that they<br>should be skilful in the management of steeds. O delighter of the Kurus,<br>attend to the wants of thy kinsmen and friends. Be thou surrounded with<br>friends and relatives. Seek thou the good of thy city. By citing the<br>precedent of the dog I have instructed thee about the duties thou<br>shouldst adopt towards thy subjects. What further dost thou wish to<br>hear?'"
