                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Then Devaki's son Janardana of universal knowledge<br>addressed king Yudhishthira who stood there with his brothers, saying,<br>'In this world, O sire, Brahmanas are always the objects of worship with<br>me. They are gods on earth having poison in their speech, and are<br>exceedingly easy to gratify. Formerly, in the Krita age, O king, a<br>Rakshasa of the name of Charvaka, O mighty-armed one, performed austere<br>penances for many years in Vadari. Brahman repeatedly solicited him to<br>ask for boons. At last the Rakshasa solicited the boon, O Bharata, of<br>immunity from fear at the hand of every being in the universe. The Lord<br>of the universe gave that high boon of immunity from fear at the hands of<br>all creatures, subject to the only limitation that he should be careful<br>of how he offended the Brahmanas. Having obtained that boon, the sinful<br>and mighty Rakshasa of fierce deeds and great prowess began to give pain<br>to the gods. The gods, persecuted by the might of the Rakshasa,<br>assembling together, approached Brahman, for compassing their foe's<br>destruction. The eternal and unchangeable god answered them, O Bharata,<br>saying, 'I have already arranged the means by which the death of this<br>Rakshasa may soon be brought about. There will be a king of the name of<br>Duryodhana. Among men, he will be the friend of this wight. Bound by<br>affection towards him, the Rakshasa will insult the Brahmanas. Stung by<br>the wrong he will inflict upon them, the Brahmanas, whose might consists<br>in speech, will in wrath censure him at which he will meet with<br>destruction. Even that Rakshasa Charvaka, O foremost of kings, slain by<br>the curse of the Brahmanas, lies there deprived of life. Do not, O bull<br>of Bharata's race, give way to grief. The kinsmen, O king, have all<br>perished in the observance of Kshatriya duties. Those butts among<br>Kshatriyas, those high-souled heroes, have all gone to heaven. Do thou<br>attend to thy duties now. O thou of unfading glory, let no grief be<br>thine. Stay thy foes, protect thy subjects, and worship the Brahmanas.'"
