                            "Yudhishthira said. 'What are the well-known indications, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, of the (future) success of an army? I desire to know<br>them.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall tell thee, O bull of Bharata's race, all the<br>well-known indications of the (future) success of an army. When the gods<br>become angry and inert are urged by fate, persons of learning, beholding<br>everything with the eye of heavenly knowledge, perform diverse auspicious<br>acts and expiatory rites including homa and the silent recitation of<br>mantras, and thus allay all evils.[304] That army in which the troops and<br>the animals are all undepressed and cheerful. O Bharata, is sure to win a<br>decided victory. The wind blows favourably from behind such troops.<br>Rainbows appear in the sky. The clouds cast their shadows upon them and<br>at times the sun shines upon them. The jackals become auspicious to them,<br>and ravens and vultures as well. When these show such regard to the army,<br>high success is sure to be won by it. Their (sacrificial) fires blaze up<br>with a pure splendour, the light going upwards and the smokeless flames<br>slightly bending towards the south. The libations poured thereon emit an<br>agreeable fragrance. These have been said to be the indications of future<br>success. The conchs and drums, blown and beat, send forth loud and deep<br>peals. The combatants become filled with alacrity. These have been said<br>to be the indications of future success. If deer and other quadrupeds be<br>seen behind or to the left of those that have already set out for battle<br>or of those that are about to set out, they are regarded auspicious. If<br>they appear to the right of the warriors while about to engage in<br>slaughter, that is regarded as an indication of success. If, however,<br>they make their appearance in the van of such persons, they indicate<br>disaster and defeat. If these birds, viz., swans and cranes and<br>Satapatras and Chashas utter auspicious cries, and all the able-bodied<br>combatants become cheerful, these are regarded as indications of future<br>success. They whose array blazes forth with splendour and becomes<br>terrible to look at in consequence of the sheen of their weapons,<br>machines, armour, and standards as also of the radiant complexion of the<br>faces of the vigorous men that stand within it, always succeed in<br>vanquishing their foes. If the combatants of a host be of pure behaviour<br>and modest deportment and attend to one another in loving-kindness, that<br>is regarded as an indication of future success. If agreeable sounds and<br>orders and sensations of touch prevail, and if the combatants become<br>inspired with gratitude and patience, that is regarded as the root of<br>success. The crow on the left of a person engaged in battle and on the<br>right of him who is about to engage in it, is regarded auspicious.<br>Appearing at the back, it indicates non-fulfilment of the objects in<br>view, while its appearance in the front forebodes danger. Even after<br>enlisting a large army consisting of the four kinds of forces, thou<br>shouldst, O Yudhishthira, first behave peacefully. If thy endeavours<br>after peace fail, then mayst thou engage in battle. The victory, O<br>Bharata, that one acquired by battle is very inferior. Victory in battle,<br>it seems, is dependent on caprice or destiny. When a large army breaks<br>and the troops begin to fly away, it is exceedingly difficult to check<br>their flight. The impetuosity of the flight resembles that of a mighty<br>current of water or of a frightened herd of deer. Some have broken. For<br>this, without adequate cause, others break, even they that are brave and<br>skilled in fight. A large army, consisting of even brave soldiers, is<br>like a large herd of Ruru deer.[305] Sometimes again it may be seen that<br>even fifty men, resolute and relying upon one another, cheerful and<br>prepared to lay down their lives, succeed in grinding enemies numerically<br>much superior. Sometimes even five, or six, or seven men, resolute and<br>standing close together, of high descent and enjoying the esteem of those<br>that know them, vanquish foes much superior to them in number. The<br>collision of battle is not desirable as long as it can be avoided. The<br>policy of conciliation, or producing disunion, and making gifts should<br>first be tried, the battle, it is said, should come after these. At the<br>very sight of a (hostile) force, fear paralyses the timid, even as at the<br>sight of the blazing bolt of heaven they ask, 'Oh, upon what would it<br>fall?'[306] Having ascertained that a battle is raging, the limbs of<br>those that go to join it, as also of him that is conquering, perspire<br>profusely.[307] The entire country. O king, (that is the seat of war),<br>becomes agitated and afflicted with all its mobile and immobile<br>population. The very marrow of embodied creatures scorched with the heat<br>of weapons, languishes with pain. A king should, therefore, on all<br>occasions, apply the arts of conciliation, mixing them with measures of<br>severity. When people are afflicted by foes, they always show a<br>disposition to come to terms.[308] Secret agents should be sent for<br>producing disunion amongst the allies of the foe. Having produced<br>disunion, it is very desirable that peace should then be made with that<br>king who happens to be more powerful than the foe (sought to be crushed).<br>If the invader does not proceed in the way, he can never succeed in<br>completely crushing his foe. In dealing with the foe, care should be<br>taken for hemming him in from all sides. Forgiveness always comes to<br>those that are good. It never comes to those that are bad. Listen now, O<br>Partha, to the uses of forgiveness and of severity. The fame of a king<br>who displays forgiveness after conquest spreads more widely. The very<br>foes of a person that is of a forgiving disposition trust him even when<br>he becomes guilty of a grave transgression. Samvara has said that having<br>afflicted a foe first, forgiveness should be shown afterwards, for a<br>wooden pole, if made straight without the application of heat in the<br>first instance, very soon assumes its former state. Persons skilled in<br>the scriptures do not, however, applaud this. Nor do they regard this as<br>an indication of a good king. On the other hand, they say that a foe<br>should be subdued and checked, like a sire subduing and checking a son,<br>without anger and without destroying him. If, O Yudhishthira, a king<br>becomes severe, he becomes an object of hatred with all creatures. If, on<br>the other hand, he becomes mild, he becomes disregarded by all. Do thou,<br>therefore, practise both severity and mildness. Before smiting, O<br>Bharata, and while smiting, utter sweet words; and having smitten, show<br>them compassion and let them understand that thou art grieving and<br>weeping for them. Having vanquished an army, the kind should address the<br>survivors saying, 'I am not at all glad that so many have been slain by<br>my troops. Alas, the latter, though repeatedly dissuaded by me, have not<br>obeyed my direction. I wish they .(that are slain) were all alive. They<br>do not deserve such death. They were all good men and true, and<br>unretreating from battle. Such men, indeed, are rare. He that has slain<br>such a hero in battle, has surely done that which is not agreeable to<br>me.' Having uttered such speeches before the survivors of the vanquished<br>foe, the king should in secret honour those amongst his own troops that<br>have bravely slain the foe. For soothing the wounded slayers for their<br>sufferings at the hand of the foe, the king, desirous of attaching them<br>to himself, should even weep, seizing their hands affectionately. The<br>king should thus, under all circumstances, behave with conciliation. A<br>king that is fearless and virtuous, becomes the beloved of all creatures.<br>All creatures, also, O Bharata, trust such a ruler. Winning their trust,<br>he succeeds in enjoying the earth as he pleases. The king should,<br>therefore, by abandoning deceitfulness, seek to obtain the trust of all<br>creatures. He should also seek to protect his subjects from all fears if<br>he seek to enjoy the earth.'"
