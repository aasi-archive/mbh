                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I desire, O bull of Bharata's race, to hear in<br>detail the source from which sin proceeds and the foundation upon which<br>it rests.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Hear, O King, what the foundation is of sin. Covetousness<br>alone is a great destroyer (of merit and goodness). From covetousness<br>proceeds sin. It is from this source that sin and irreligiousness flow,<br>together with great misery. This covetousness is the spring of also all<br>the cunning and hypocrisy in the world. It is covetousness that makes men<br>commit sin. From covetousness proceeds wrath; from covetousness flows<br>lust, and it is from covetousness that loss of judgment, deception,<br>pride, arrogance, and malice, as also vindictiveness, shamelessness, loss<br>of prosperity, loss of virtue, anxiety, and infamy spring, miserliness,<br>cupidity, desire for every kind of improper act, pride of birth, pride of<br>learning, pride of beauty, pride of wealth, pitilessness for all<br>creatures, malevolence towards all, mistrust in respect of all,<br>insincerity towards all, appropriation of other people's wealth,<br>ravishment of other people's wives, harshness of speech, anxiety,<br>propensity to speak ill of others, violent craving for the indulgence of<br>lust, gluttony, liability to premature death, violent propensity towards<br>malice, irresistible liking for falsehood, unconquerable appetite for<br>indulging in the passions, insatiable desire for indulging the ear,<br>evil-speaking, boastfulness, arrogance, non-doing of duties, rashness,<br>and perpetration of every kind of evil act,&#8212;all these proceed from<br>covetousness. In life, men are unable, whether infants or youth or<br>adults, to abandon covetousness. Such is the nature of covetousness that<br>it never decays even with the decay of life. Like the ocean that can<br>never be filled by the constant discharge of even innumerable rivers of<br>immeasurable depths, covetousness is incapable of being gratified by<br>acquisitions to any extent. The covetousness, however, which is never<br>gratified by acquisitions and satiated by the accomplishment of desires,<br>that which is not known in its real nature by the gods, the Gandharvas,<br>the Asuras, the great snakes, and, in fact, by all classes of beings,<br>that irresistible passion, along with that folly which invites the heart<br>to the unrealities of the world, should ever be conquered by a person of<br>cleansed soul. Pride, malice, slander, crookedness, and incapacity to<br>hear other people's good, are vices, O descendant of Kuru, that are to be<br>seen in persons of uncleansed soul under the domination of covetousness.<br>Even persons of great learning who bear in their minds all the voluminous<br>scriptures, and who are competent to dispel the doubts of others, show<br>themselves in this respect to be of weak understanding and feel great<br>misery in consequence of this passion. Covetous men are wedded to envy<br>and anger. They are outside the pale of good behaviour. Of crooked<br>hearts, the speeches they utter are sweet. They resemble, therefore, dark<br>pits whose mouths are covered with grass. They attire themselves in the<br>hypocritical cloak of religion. Of low minds, they rob the world, setting<br>up (if need be) the standard of religion and virtue. Relying upon the<br>strength of apparent reasons, they create diverse kinds of schisms in<br>religion. Intent upon accomplishing the purposes of cupidity, they<br>destroy the ways of righteousness. When wicked-souled persons under the<br>domination of covetousness apparently practise the duties of<br>righteousness, the consequence that results is that the desecrations<br>committed by them soon become current among men. Pride, anger, arrogance,<br>insensibility, paroxysms of joy and sorrow, and self-importance, all<br>these, O descendant of Kuru, are to be seen in persons swayed by<br>covetousness. Know that they who are always under the influence of<br>covetousness are wicked. I shall now tell thee of those about whom thou<br>askest, viz., those who are called good and whose practices are pure.<br>They who have no fear of an obligation to return to this world (after<br>death), they who have no fear of the next world, they who are not<br>addicted to animal food and who have no liking for what is agreeable and<br>no dislike for what is otherwise, they to whom good behaviour is ever<br>dear, they in whom there is self-restraint, they to whom pleasure and<br>pain are equal, they who have truth for their high refuge, they who give<br>but not take, they who have compassion, they who worship Pitris, gods and<br>guests, they who are always ready to exert themselves (for the good of<br>others), they who are universal benefactors, they who are possessed of<br>great courage (of mind), they who observe all the duties laid down in the<br>scriptures, they who are devoted to the good of all, they who can give<br>their all and lay down their very lives for others, are regarded as good<br>and virtuous, O Bharata! Those promoters of righteousness are incapable<br>of being forced away from the path of virtue. Their conduct, conformable<br>to the model set by the righteous men of old, can never be otherwise.<br>They are perfectly fearless, they are tranquil, they are mild, and they<br>always adhere to the right path. Full of compassion, they are always<br>worshipped by the good. They are free from lust and anger. They are not<br>attached to any worldly object. They have no pride. They are observant of<br>excellent vows. They are always objects of regard. Do thou, therefore,<br>always wait upon them and seek instruction from them. They never acquire<br>virtue, O Yudhishthira, for the, sake of wealth or of fame. They acquire<br>it on the other hand, because it is a duty like that of cherishing the<br>body. Fear, wrath, restlessness, and sorrow do not dwell in them. There<br>is not the outward garb of religion for misleading their fellowmen. There<br>is no mystery with them. They are perfectly contented. There is no error<br>of judgment arising from covetousness. They are always devoted to truth<br>and sincerity. Their hearts never fall from righteousness. Thou shouldst<br>show thy regard for them always, O son of Kunti! They are never delighted<br>at any acquisition or pained at any loss. Without attachment to anything,<br>and freed from pride, they are wedded to the quality of goodness, and<br>they cast an equal eye on all. Gain and loss, weal and woe, the agreeable<br>and the disagreeable, life and death, are equal in the eyes of those men<br>of firm tread, engaged in the pursuit of (divine) knowledge, and devoted<br>to the path of tranquillity and righteousness. Keeping thy senses under<br>restraint and without yielding to heedlessness, thou shouldst always<br>worship those high-souled persons who bear such love for virtue. O<br>blessed one, one's words become productive of good only through the<br>favour of the gods. Under other circumstances, words produce evil<br>consequence."[455]'
