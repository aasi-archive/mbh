                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Endued with great energy, the delighter of the Kurus<br>(viz., Bhishma), said, 'I shall discourse on the subject of duty. My<br>speech and mind have become steady, through thy grace, O Govinda, since<br>thou art the eternal soul of every being. Let the righteous-souled<br>Yudhishthira question me about morality and duty. I shall then be much<br>gratified and shall speak of all duties. Let the son of Pandu, that royal<br>sage of virtuous and great soul, upon whose birth all the Vrishnis were<br>filled with joy, question me. Let the son of Pandu, who has no equal<br>among all the Kurus, among all persons of righteous behaviour, and among<br>men of great celebrity, put questions to me. Let the son of Pandu, in<br>whom are intelligence, self-restraint, Brahmacharya, forgiveness,<br>righteousness, mental vigour and energy, put questions to me. Let the son<br>of Pandu, who always by his good offices honours his relatives and guests<br>and servants and others that are dependent on him, put questions to me.<br>Let the son of Pandu, in whom are truth and charity and penances,<br>heroism, peacefulness, cleverness, and fearlessness, put questions to me.<br>Let the righteous-souled son of Pandu, who would never commit a sin<br>influenced by desire of Pleasure or Profit or from fear put questions to<br>me. Let the son of Pandu, who is ever devoted to truth, to forgiveness,<br>to knowledge and to guests, and who always makes gifts unto the<br>righteous, put questions to me. Let the son of Pandu, who is ever engaged<br>in sacrifices and study of the Vedas and the practice of morality and<br>duty who is ever peaceful and who has heard all mysteries, put questions<br>to me.'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'King Yudhishthira the just, overcome with great shame<br>and fearful of (thy) curse, does not venture to approach thee. That lord<br>of earth, O monarch, having caused a great slaughter, ventures not to<br>approach thee from fear of (thy) curse. Having pierced with shafts those<br>that deserved his worship, those that were devoted to him, those that<br>were his preceptors, those that were his relatives and kinsmen and those<br>that were worthy of his highest regard, he ventures not to approach thee.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'As the duty of the Brahmanas consists of the practice of<br>charity, study, and penances, so the duty of Kshatriyas is to cast away<br>their bodies, O Krishna, in battle. A Kshatriya should stay sires and<br>grandsires and brothers and preceptors and relatives and kinsmen that may<br>engage with him in unjust battle. This is their declared duty. That<br>Kshatriya, O Kesava, is said to be acquainted with his duty who slays in<br>battle his very preceptors if they happen to be sinful and covetous and<br>disregardful of restraints and vows. That Kshatriya is said to be<br>acquainted with his duty who slays in battle the person that from<br>covetousness disregards the eternal barriers of virtue.[160] That<br>Kshatriya is said to be acquainted with duty who in battle makes the<br>earth a lake of blood, having the hair of slain warriors for the grass<br>and straw floating on it, and having elephants for its rocks, and<br>standards for the trees on its banks. A Kshatriya, when challenged,<br>should always fight in battle, since Manu has said that a righteous<br>battle (in the case of a Kshatriya) leads to both heaven and fame on<br>earth.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'After Bhishma had spoken thus, Dharma's son<br>Yudhishthira, with great humility, approached the Kuru hero and stood in<br>his sight. He seized the feet of Bhishma who in return gladdened him with<br>affectionate words. Smelling his head, Bhishma asked Yudhishthira to take<br>his seat. Then Ganga's son, that foremost of bowmen, addressed<br>Yudhishthira, saying, 'Do not fear, O best of the Kurus! Ask me, O child,<br>without any anxiety.'"
