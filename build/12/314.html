                            'Yajnavalkya said, Brahmanas conversant with the topics of enquiry speak<br>of the two feet as Adhyatma, the act of walking as Adhibhuta, and Vishnu<br>as Adhidaivatam (of those two limbs). The lower duct (anal canal) is<br>Adhyatma; its function of throwing out the excreta is Adhibhuta, and<br>Mitra (Surya) is the Adhidaivata (of that organ). The organ of generation<br>is called Adhyatma. Its agreeable function is called Adhibhuta, and<br>Prajapati is its Adhidaivata. The hands are Adhyatma; their function as<br>represented by acts is Adhibhuta; and Indra is the Adhidaivata of those<br>limbs. The organs of speech are Adhyatma; the words uttered by them are<br>Adhibhuta; and Agni is their Adhidaivata. The eye is Adhyatma; vision or<br>form is its Adhibhuta; and Surya is the Adhidaivata of that organ. The<br>ear is Adhyatma; sound is Adhibhuta; and the points of the horizon are<br>its Adhidaivata. The tongue is Adhyatma, taste is its Adhibhuta; and<br>Water is its Adhidaivata. The sense of scent is Adhyatma; odour is its<br>Adhibhuta; and Earth is its Adhidaivata. The skin is Adhyatma; touch is<br>its Adhibhuta; and Wind is its Adhidaivata. Mind has been called<br>Adhyatma; that with which the Mind is employed is Adhibhuta; and<br>Chandramas is its Adhidaivata. Consciousness is Adhyatma; conviction in<br>one's identity with Prakriti is its Adhibhuta; and Mahat or Buddhi is its<br>Adhidaivata. Buddhi is Adhyatma; that which is to be understood is its<br>Adhibhuta; and Kshetrajna is its Adhidaivata. I have thus truly expounded<br>to thee, O king, with its details taken individually, the puissance of<br>the Supreme (in manifesting Himself in different forms) in the beginning,<br>the middle, and the end, O thou that art fully conversant with the nature<br>of the original topics or principles. Prakriti, cheerfully and of her own<br>accord, as if for sport, O monarch, produces, by undergoing modifications<br>herself, thousands and thousands of combinations of her original<br>transformations called Gunahs. As men can light thousands of lamps from<br>but a single lamp, after the same manner Prakriti, by modification,<br>multiplies into thousands of existent objects the (three) attributes (of<br>Sattwa and Rajas and Tamas) of Purusha. Patience, joy, prosperity,<br>satisfaction, brightness of all faculties, happiness, purity, health,<br>contentment, faith, liberality, compassion, forgiveness, firmness,<br>benevolence, equanimity, truth, acquittance of obligations, mildness,<br>modesty, calmness, external purity, simplicity, observance of obligatory<br>practices, dispassionateness, fearlessness of heart, disregard for the<br>appearance or otherwise of good and evil as also for past<br>acts,&#8212;appropriation of objects only when obtained by gift, the absence<br>of cupidity, regard for the interests of others, compassion for all<br>creatures,&#8212;these have been said to be the qualities that attach to the<br>attribute of Sattwa. The tale of qualities attaching to the attribute of<br>Rajas consists of pride of personal beauty, assertion of lordship, war,<br>disclination to give, absence of compassion, enjoyment and enduring of<br>happiness and misery, pleasure in speaking ill of others, indulgence in<br>quarrels and disputes of every kind, arrogance, discourtesy, anxiety,<br>indulgence in hostilities, sorrow, appropriation of what belongs to<br>others, shamelessness, crookedness, disunions, roughness, lust, wrath,<br>pride, assertion of superiority, malice, and calumny. These are said to<br>spring from the attributes of Rajas. I shall now tell thee of that<br>assemblage of qualities which springs from Tamas. They are stupefaction<br>of judgment, obscuration of every faculty, darkness and blind darkness.<br>By darkness is implied death, and by blind darkness is meant wrath.<br>Besides these, the other indications of Tamas are greediness in respect<br>of all kinds of food, ceaseless appetite for both food and drink, taking<br>pleasure in scents and robes and sports and beds and seats and sleep<br>during the day and calumny and all kinds of acts proceeding from<br>heedlessness, taking pleasure, from ignorance (of purer sources of joy)<br>in dancing and instrumental and vocal music, and aversion for every kind<br>of religion. These, indeed, are the indications of Tamas&#8212;'"
