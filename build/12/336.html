                            "Bhishma said, 'Addressed by Narayana, that foremost of beings, in these<br>words, Narada, the foremost of men, then said these words unto Narayana<br>for the good of the world.<br><br>"Narada said, Let that object be accomplished for which thou, O self-born<br>Being, hast taken birth in four forms in the house of Dharma! I shall now<br>repair (to the White Island) for beholding thy original nature. I always<br>worship my seniors. I have never divulged the secrets of others. O lord<br>of the universe, I have studied the Vedas with care. I have undergone<br>austere penances. I have never spoken an untruth. As ordained in the<br>scriptures, I have always protected the four that should be<br>protected.[1793] I have always behaved equally towards friends and foes.<br>Wholly and conclusively devoted to Him, that first of deities, viz., the<br>Supreme Soul, I incessantly adore Him. Having cleansed my soul by these<br>acts of special merit, why shall I not succeed in obtaining a sight of<br>that Infinite Lord of the universe?&#8212;Hearing these words of Parameshthi's<br>son, Narayana, that protector of the scriptures, dismissed him,<br>saying,&#8212;Go, O Narada!&#8212;Before dismissing him, however, the great deity<br>worshipped the celestial Rishi with those rites and ceremonies which have<br>been laid down in the scriptures by himself. Narada also gave due honours<br>to the ancient Rishi Narayana. After such honours had been mutually given<br>and received, the son of Parameshthi departed from that spot. Endued with<br>high Yoga-puissance, Narada suddenly soared into the firmament and<br>reached the summit of the mountains of Meru. Proceeding to a retired spot<br>on that summit, the great ascetic took rest for a short while. He than<br>cast his eyes towards the north western direction and beheld an<br>exceedingly wonderful sight. Towards the north, in the ocean of milk,<br>there is a large island named the White Island. The learned say that its<br>distance from the mountains of Meru is greater than two and thirty<br>thousand Yojanas. The denizens of that realm have no senses. They live<br>without taking food of any kind. Their eyes are winkless. They always<br>emit excellent perfumes. Their complexions are white. They are cleansed<br>from every sin. They blast the eyes of those sinners that look at them.<br>Their bones and bodies are as hard as thunder. They regard honour and<br>dishonour in the same light. They all look as if they are of celestial<br>origin. Besides, all of them are endued, with auspicious marks and great<br>strength. Their heads seem to be like umbrellas. Their voices are deep<br>like that of the clouds. Each of them has four Mushkas.[1794] The soles<br>of their feet are marked by hundreds of lines. They have sixty teeth all<br>of which are white (and large), and eight smaller ones. They have many<br>tongues. With those tongues they seem to lick the very Sun whose face is<br>turned towards every direction. Indeed, they seem to be capable of<br>devouring that deity from whom hath sprung the entire universe, the<br>Vedas, the deities, and the Munis wedded to the attribute of tranquillity.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'O grandsire, thou hast said that those beings have<br>no senses, that they do not eat anything for supporting their lives; that<br>their eyes are winkless; and that they always emit excellent perfumes. I<br>ask, how were they born? What also is the superior end to which they<br>attain? O chief of Bharata's race, are the indications of those men that<br>become emancipate the same as those by which the denizens of the White<br>Island are distinguished? Do thou dispel my doubts? The curiosity I feel<br>is very great. Thou art the repository of all histories and discourses.<br>As regards ourselves, we entirely depend on thee for knowledge and<br>instruction!<br><br>"Bhishma continued,&#8212;'This narrative, O monarch, which I have heard from<br>my sire, is extensive. I shall now recite it to thee. Indeed, it is<br>regarded as the essence of all narratives. There was, in times past, a<br>king on Earth of the name of Uparichara. He was known to be the friend of<br>Indra, the chief of the celestials. He was devoted to Narayana known also<br>by the name of Hari. He was observant of all the duties laid down in the<br>scriptures. Ever devoted to his sire, he was always heedful and ready for<br>action. He won the sovereignty of the world in consequence of a boon he<br>had obtained from Narayana. Following the Sattwata ritual that had been<br>declared in days of yore by Surya himself, king Uparichara used to<br>worship the God of gods (Narayana), and when his worship was over, he<br>used to adore (with what remained) the grandsire of the universe.[1795]<br>After worshipping the Grandsires (Pitris), he worshipped the Brahmanas.<br>He then divided the offerings among those that were dependent on him.<br>With what remained after serving those, the king satisfied his own<br>hunger. Devoted to truth, the monarch abstained from doing any injury to<br>any creature. With his whole soul, the king was devoted to that God of<br>gods, viz., Janarddana, who is without beginning and middle and end, who<br>is the Creator of the universe, and who is without deterioration of any<br>kind. Beholding the devotion to Narayana of that slayer of foes, the<br>divine chief of the celestials himself shared with him his own seat and<br>bed. His kingdom and wealth and spouses and animals were all regarded by<br>him as obtained from Narayana. He, therefore, offered all his possessions<br>to that great deity.[1796] Adopting the Sattwata ritual, king Uparichara,<br>with concentrated soul, used to discharge all his sacrificial acts and<br>observances, both optional and obligatory. In the place of that<br>illustrious king, many foremost Brahmanas, well conversant with the<br>Pancharatra ritual, used to eat before all others the food offered to the<br>god Narayana. As long as that slayer of foes continued to rule his<br>kingdom righteously, no untruth ever escaped his lips and no evil thought<br>ever entered his mind. With his limbs he never committed even the<br>slightest sin. The seven celebrated Rishis, viz., Marichi, Atri, Angiras,<br>Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, and Vasishta of great energy, who came to be<br>known by the name of Chitra-sikhandins, uniting together on the breast of<br>that foremost of mountains, viz., Meru, promulgated an excellent treatise<br>on duties and observances that was consistent with the four Vedas. The<br>contents of that treatise were uttered by seven mouths, and constituted<br>the best compendium of human duties and observances. Known, as already<br>stated, by the name of Chitra-sikhandins, those seven Rishis constitute<br>the seven (Pravriti) elements (of Mahat, Ahankara, etc.) and the Selfborn<br>Manu, who is the eighth in the enumeration, constituted original<br>Prakriti. These eight uphold the universe, and it was these eight that<br>promulgated the treatise adverted to. With their senses and minds under<br>complete control, and ever devoted to Yoga, these eight ascetics, with<br>concentrated souls, are fully conversant with the Past, the Present and<br>the Future, and are devoted to the religion of Truth.&#8212;This is good this<br>is Brahma,&#8212;this is highly beneficial,&#8212;reflecting in their minds in this<br>way, those Rishis created the worlds, and the science of morality and<br>duty that governs those worlds. In that treatise the authors discoursed<br>on Religion and Wealth and Pleasure, and subsequently on Emancipation<br>also. They also laid down in it the various restrictions and limitations<br>intended for the Earth as also for Heaven. They composed that treatise<br>after having worshipped with penances the puissant and illustrious<br>Narayana called also Hari, for a thousand celestial years, in company<br>with many other Rishis. Gratified with their penances and worship,<br>Narayana commanded the goddess of speech, viz. Saraswati, to enter into<br>the person of those Rishis. The goddess, for the good of the worlds did<br>what she was ordered. In consequence of the entrance of the goddess of<br>speech into their persons, those Rishis, well conversant with penances,<br>succeeded in composing that foremost of treatises in respect of vocables,<br>import, and reason.[1797] Having composed that treatise sanctified with<br>the syllable Om, the Rishis first of all read it to Narayana who became<br>highly pleased with what he heard. The foremost of all Beings then<br>addressed those Rishis in an incorporeal voice and said,&#8212;Excellent is<br>this treatise that ye have composed consisting of a hundred thousand<br>verses. The duties and observances of all the worlds will flow from this<br>your work! In complete accordance with the four Vedas, viz., the<br>Yajushes, the Samans, and the Atharvans of Angiras, the treatise of yours<br>will be an authority in all the worlds in respect of both Pravritti and<br>Nivritti.[1798] Agreeably to the authority of the scriptures I have<br>created Brahman from the attribute of Grace, Rudra from my Wrath, and<br>yourselves, Ye Brahmanas, as representing the Pravriti-elements (of<br>Mahat, Ahankara, etc.), Surya, and Chandramas, Wind, and Earth, and Water<br>and Fire, all the stars and planets and constellations, all else that is<br>called by the name of creatures, and utterers of Brahma (or the Vedas),<br>they all live and act in their respective spheres and are all respected<br>as authorities. Even this treatise that ye have composed shall be<br>regarded by all persons in the same light, viz., as a work of the highest<br>authority. This is my command. Guided by this treatise, the Self-born<br>Manu himself will declare to the world its course of duties and<br>observances. When Usanas and Vrihaspati will arise, they also will<br>promulgate their respective treatises on morality and religion, guided by<br>and quoting from this your treatise.[1799] After the publication of his<br>treatise by the Self-born Manu and of that by Usanas, and after the<br>publication of the treatise also by Vrihaspati, this science composed by<br>you will be acquired by king Vasu (otherwise known by the name of<br>Uparichara). Indeed ye foremost of regenerate ones, that king will<br>acquire this knowledge of this work from Vrihaspati. That King, filled<br>with all good thoughts, will become deeply devoted to me. Guided by this<br>treatise, he will accomplish all his religious acts and observances.<br>Verily, this treatise composed by you will be the foremost of all<br>treatise on morality and religion. Possessed of the excellence, this<br>treatise is fraught with instructions for acquiring both Wealth and<br>Religious merit, and is full of mysteries. In consequence of the<br>promulgation of this treatise of yours, ye will be progenitors of an<br>extensive race. King Uparichara also will become endued with greatness<br>and prosperity. Upon the death, however, of that king, this eternal<br>treatise will disappear from the world. I tell you all this.&#8212;Having said<br>these words unto all those Rishis, the invisible Narayana left them and<br>proceeded to some place that was not known to them. Then those sires of<br>the world, those Rishis that bestowed their thoughts on the ends pursued<br>by the world, duly promulgated that treatise which is the eternal origin<br>of all duties and observances. Subsequently, when Vrihaspati was born in<br>Angiras's race in the first or the Krita age, those seven Rishis charged<br>him with the task of promulgating their treatise which was consistent<br>with the Upanishads and the several branches of the Vedas. They<br>themselves who were upholders of the universe and the first promulgators<br>of duties and religious observances, then proceeded to the place they<br>chose, resolved to devote themselves to penances.'"
