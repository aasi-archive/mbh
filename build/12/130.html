                            "Yudhishthira said, 'What course of conduct should be adopted by a king<br>shorn of friends, having many enemies, possessed of an exhausted<br>treasury, and destitute of troops, O Bharata! What, indeed, should be his<br>conduct when he is surrounded by wicked ministers, when his counsels are<br>all divulged, when he does not see his way clearly before him, when he<br>assails another kingdom, when he is engaged in grinding a hostile<br>kingdom, and when though weak he is at war with a stronger ruler? What,<br>indeed, should be the conduct of a king the affairs of whose kingdom are<br>ill-regulated, and who disregards the requirements of place and time, who<br>is unable, in consequence of his oppressions, to bring about peace and<br>cause disunion among his foes? Should he seek the acquisition of wealth<br>by evil means, or should he lay down his life without seeking wealth?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Conversant as thou art with duties, thou hast, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, asked me a question relating to mystery (in connection<br>with duties).[388] Without being questioned, O Yudhishthira, I could not<br>venture to discourse upon this duty. Morality is very subtle. One<br>understands it, O bull of Bharata's race, by the aid of the texts of<br>scriptures. By remembering what one has heard and by practising good<br>acts, some one in some place may become a righteous person. By acting<br>with intelligence the king may or may not succeed in acquiring<br>wealth.[389] Aided by thy own intelligence do thou think what answer<br>should be given to thy question on this head. Listen, O Bharata, to the<br>means, fraught with great merit, by which kings may conduct themselves<br>(during seasons of distress). For the sake of true morality, however, I<br>would not call those means righteous. If the treasury be filled by<br>oppression, conduct like this brings the king to the verge of<br>destruction. Even this is the conclusion of all intelligent men who have<br>thought upon the subject. The kind of scriptures or science which one<br>always studies gives him the kind of knowledge which it is capable of<br>giving. Such Knowledge verily becomes agreeable to him. Ignorance leads<br>to barrenness of invention in respect of means. Contrivance of means,<br>again, through the aid of knowledge, becomes the source of great<br>felicity. Without entertaining any scruples and any malice,[390] listen<br>to these instructions. Through the decrease of the treasury, the king's<br>forces are decreased. The king should, therefore, fill his treasury (by<br>any means) like to one creating water in a wilderness which is without<br>water. Agreeably to this code of quasi-morality practised by the<br>ancients, the king should, when the time for it comes,[391] show<br>compassion to his people. This is eternal duty. For men that are able and<br>competent,[392] the duties are of one kind. In seasons of distress,<br>however, one's duties are of a different kind. Without wealth a king may<br>(by penances and the like) acquire religious merit. Life, however, is<br>much more important than religious merit. (And as life cannot be<br>supported without wealth, no such merit should be sought which stands in<br>the way of the acquisition of wealth). A king that is weak, by acquiring<br>only religious merit, never succeeds in obtaining just and proper means<br>for sustenance; and since he cannot, by even his best exertions, acquire<br>power by the aid of only religious merit, therefore the practices in<br>seasons of distress are sometimes regarded as not inconsistent with<br>morality. The learned, however, are of opinion that those practices lead<br>to sinfulness. After the season of distress is over, what should the<br>Kshatriya do? He should (at such a time) conduct himself in such a way<br>that his merit may not be destroyed. He should also act in such a way<br>that he may not have to succumb to his enemies.[393] Even these have been<br>declared to be his duties. He should not sink in despondency. He should<br>not (in times of distress) seek to rescue (from the peril of destruction)<br>the merit of others or of himself. On the other hand, he should rescue<br>his own self. This is the settled conclusion.[394] There is this Sruti,<br>viz., that it is settled that Brahmanas, who are conversant with duties,<br>should have proficiency in respect of duties. Similarly, as regards the<br>Kshatriya, his proficiency should consist in exertion, since might of<br>arms is his great possession. When a Kshatriya's means of support are<br>gone, what should he not take excepting what belongs to ascetics and what<br>is owned by Brahmanas? Even as a Brahmana in a season of distress may<br>officiate at the sacrifice of a person for whom he should never officiate<br>(at other and ordinary times) and eat forbidden food, so there is no<br>doubt that a Kshatriya (in distress) may take wealth from every one<br>except ascetics and Brahmanas. For one afflicted (by an enemy and seeking<br>the means of escape) what can be an improper outlet? For a person immured<br>(within a dungeon and seeking escape) what can be an improper path? When<br>a person becomes afflicted, he escapes by even an improper outlet. For a<br>Kshatriya that has, in consequence of the weakness of his treasury and<br>army, become exceedingly humiliated, neither a life of mendicancy nor the<br>profession of a Vaisya or that of a Sudra has been laid down. The<br>profession ordained for a Kshatriya is the acquisition of wealth by<br>battle and victory. He should never beg of a member of his own order. The<br>person who supports himself at ordinary times by following the practices<br>primarily laid for him, may in seasons of distress support himself by<br>following the practices laid down in the alternative. In a season of<br>distress, when ordinary practices cannot be followed, a Kshatriya may<br>live by even unjust and improper means. The very Brahmanas, it is seen,<br>do the same when their means of living are destroyed. When the Brahmanas<br>(at such times) conduct themselves thus, what doubt is there in respect<br>of Kshatriyas? This is, indeed, settled. Without sinking into despondency<br>and yielding to destruction, a Kshatriya may (by force) take what he can<br>from persons that are rich. Know that the Kshatriya is the protector and<br>the destroyer of the people, Therefore, a Kshatriya in distress should<br>take (by force) what he can, with a view to (ultimately) protect the<br>people. No person in this world, O king, can support life without<br>injuring other creatures. The very ascetic leading a solitary life in the<br>depths of the forest is no exception. A Kshatriya should not live,<br>relying upon destiny,[395] especially he, O chief of the Kurus, who is<br>desirous of ruling. The king and the kingdom should always mutually<br>protect each other. This is an eternal duty. As the king protects, by<br>spending all his possessions, the kingdom when it sinks into distress,<br>even so should the kingdom protect the king when he sinks into distress.<br>The king even at the extremity of distress, should never give up[396] his<br>treasury, his machinery for chastising the wicked, his army, his friends<br>and allies and other necessary institutions and the chiefs existing in<br>his kingdom. Men conversant with duty say that one must keep one's seeds,<br>deducting them from one's very food. This is a truth cited from the<br>treatise of Samvara well-known for his great powers of illusion, Fie on<br>the life of that king whose kingdom languishes. Fie on the life of that<br>man who from want of means goes to a foreign country for a living. The<br>king's roots are his treasury and army. His army, again, has its roots in<br>his treasury. His army is the root of all his religious merits. His<br>religious merits, again are the root of his subjects. The treasury can<br>never be filled without oppressing others. How 'then can the army be kept<br>without oppression? The king, therefore, in seasons of distress, incurs<br>no fault by oppressing his subjects for filling the treasury. For<br>performing sacrifices many improper acts are done. For this reason a king<br>incurs no fault by doing improper acts (when the object is to fill his<br>treasury in a season of distress). For the sake of wealth practices other<br>than those which are proper are followed (in seasons of distress). If (at<br>such times) such improper practices be not adopted, evil is certain to<br>result. All those institutions that are kept up for working destruction<br>and misery exist for the sake of collecting wealth.[397] Guided by such<br>considerations, all intelligent king should settle his course (at such<br>times). As animals and other things are necessary for sacrifices, as<br>sacrifices are for purifying the heart, and as animals, sacrifices, and<br>purity of the heart are all for final emancipation, even so policy and<br>chastisement exist for the treasury, the treasury exists for the army,<br>and policy and treasury and army all the three exist for vanquishing foes<br>and protecting or enlarging the kingdom. I shall here cite an example<br>illustrating the true ways of morality. A large tree is cut down for<br>making of it a sacrificial stake. In cutting it, other trees that stand<br>in its way have also to be cut down. These also, in falling down, kill<br>others standing on the spot. Even so they that stand in the way of making<br>a well-filled treasury must have to be slain. I do not see how else<br>success can be had. By wealth, both the worlds, viz., this and the other,<br>can be had, as also Truth and religious merit. A person without wealth is<br>more dead than alive. Wealth for the performance of sacrifices should be<br>acquired by every means. The demerit that attaches to an act done in a<br>season of distress is not equal to that which attaches to the same act if<br>done at other times, O Bharata! The acquisition of wealth and its<br>abandonment cannot both be possibly seen in the same person, O king! I do<br>not see a rich man in the forest. With respect to every wealth that is<br>seen in this world, every one contends with every one else, saying, 'This<br>shall be mine,' 'This shall be mine!' This is nothing, O scorcher of<br>foes, that is so meritorious for a king as the possession of a kingdom.<br>It is sinful for a king to oppress his subjects with heavy impositions at<br>ordinary times. In a season, however, of distress, it is quite different.<br>Some acquire wealth by gifts and sacrifices; some who have a liking for<br>penances acquire wealth by penances; some acquire it by the aid of their<br>intelligence and cleverness. A person without wealth is said to be weak,<br>while he that has wealth become powerful. A man of wealth may acquire<br>everything. A king that has well-filled treasury succeeds in<br>accomplishing everything. By his treasury a king may earn religious<br>merit, gratify his desire for pleasure, obtain the next world, and this<br>also. The treasury, however, should be filled by the aid of righteousness<br>and never by unrighteous practices, such, that is, as pass for righteous<br>in times of distress.
