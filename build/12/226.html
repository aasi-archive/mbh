                            "Bhishma said, 'In this connection is also cited the old narrative of the<br>discourse between him of a hundred sacrifices and the Asura Namuchi, O<br>Yudhishthira. When the Asura Namuchi, who was conversant with the birth<br>and the death of all creatures, was sitting, divested of prosperity but<br>untroubled at heart like the vast ocean in perfect stillness, Purandara<br>addressed him these: words, 'Fallen off from thy place, bound with cords,<br>brought under the sway of thy foes, and divested of prosperity, dost<br>thou, O Namuchi, indulge in grief or passest thou thy days cheerfully?'<br><br>"Namuchi answered, 'By indulging in such sorrow as cannot be warded off<br>one only wastes one's body and gladdens one's foes. Then, again, no one<br>can lighten another's sorrow by taking any portion of it upon oneself.<br>For these reasons, O Sakra, I do not indulge in sorrow. All this that<br>thou seest hath one end.[849] Indulgence in sorrow destroys personal<br>comeliness, prosperity, life, and virtue itself, O chief of the deities!<br>Without doubt, suppressing that sorrow which comes upon oneself and which<br>is born of an improper disposition of the mind, one possessed of true<br>knowledge should reflect in one's mind of that which is productive of the<br>highest good and which dwells in the heart itself.[850] When one sets<br>one's mind upon what is for one's highest good, without doubt, the result<br>that takes place is that one's objects are all accomplished.[851] There<br>is One Ordainer, and no second. His control extends over the being that<br>lies within the womb. Controlled by the great Ordainer I go on as He sets<br>me on, like water running along a downward path. Knowing what is<br>existence and what is emancipation, and understanding also that the<br>latter is superior to the former, I do not, however, strive for attaining<br>to it. Doing acts that tend towards the direction of virtue and also<br>those that tend towards the opposite direction, I go on as He sets me on.<br>One gets those things that are ordained to be got. That which is to<br>happen actually happens. One has repeatedly to reside in such wombs in<br>which one is placed by the Ordainer. One has no choice in the matter.<br>That person is never stupefied, who when placed in any particular<br>condition, accepts it as that which he was ordained to be placed in. Men<br>are affected by pleasure and pain that come by turns in course of Time.<br>There is no personal agency (in the matter of pleasure or pain to any<br>one). In this lies sorrow, viz., that he that dislikes sorrow regards<br>himself as the actor.[852] Amongst Rishis, gods, great Asuras, persons<br>fully conversant with the three Vedas, and ascetics in the forest, who is<br>there whom calamities do not approach? Those, however, that are<br>conversant with the Soul and that which is not-Soul never fear<br>calamities. The person of wisdom, naturally standing immovable like<br>Himavat, never gives way to wrath; never suffers himself to be attached<br>to the objects of the senses; never languishes in sorrow or rejoices in<br>happiness. When overwhelmed with even great afflictions, such a person<br>never gives way to grief. That person is a very superior one whom even<br>great success cannot gladden and even dire calamities cannot afflict, and<br>who bears pleasure and pain, and that which is between them both, with an<br>unmoved heart. Into whatever condition a person may fall, he should<br>summon cheerfulness without yielding to sorrow. Indeed, even thus should<br>one drive off from one's self one's swelling grief that is born in one's<br>mind and that is (if not dispelled) sure to give pain. That assembly of<br>learned persons engaged in the discussion of duties based upon both the<br>Srutis and the Smritis is not a good assembly,&#8212;indeed, that does not<br>deserve to be called by the name of assembly,&#8212;entering which a wicked<br>man does not become penetrated with fear (born of his wicked deeds). That<br>man is the foremost of his species who having dived into and enquired<br>after righteousness succeeds in acting according to the conclusions to<br>which he arrives.[853] The acts of a wise man are not easily<br>comprehensible. He that is wise, is never Stupefied when afflictions come<br>upon him. Even if he falls away from his position like Gautama in his old<br>age, in consequence of the direct calamity, he does not suffer himself to<br>be stupefied.[854] By any of these, viz., mantras, strength, energy,<br>wisdom, prowess, behaviour, conduct, or the affluence of wealth, can a<br>person acquire that which has not been ordained to be acquired by him?<br>What sorrow then is there for the non-acquisition of that upon which one<br>has set one's heart? Before I was born, they that have the matter in<br>their hands had ordained what I am to do and suffer. I am fulfilling what<br>was thus ordained for me. What then can death do to me? One obtains only<br>that which has been ordained to be obtained. One goes thither whither it<br>was ordained that one is to go. Those sorrows and joys are obtained that<br>are ordained to be obtained. That man who knowing this fully, does not<br>suffer himself to be stupefied, and who is contented under both happiness<br>and sorrow, is regarded as the foremost of his species.'"
