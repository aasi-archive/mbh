                            "Vyasa said, 'I shall now tell thee, how, when his day is gone and his<br>night comes, he withdraws all things unto himself, or how the Supreme<br>Lord, making this gross universe exceedingly subtile, merges everything<br>into his Soul. When the time comes for universal dissolution, a dozen<br>Suns, and Agni with his seven flames, begin to burn. The whole universe,<br>wrapt by those flames, begins to blaze forth in a vast conflagration. All<br>things mobile and immobile that are on the earth first disappear and<br>merge into the substance of which this planet is composed. After all<br>mobile and immobile objects have thus disappeared, the earth, shorn of<br>trees and herbs, looks naked like a tortoise shell. Then water takes up<br>the attribute of earth, viz., scent. When earth becomes shorn of its<br>principal attribute, that element is on the eve of dissolution. Water<br>then prevails. Surging into mighty billows and producing awful roars,<br>only water fills this space and moves about or remains still. Then the<br>attribute of water is taken by Heat, and losing its own attribute, water<br>finds rest in that element. Dazzling flames of fire, ablaze all around,<br>conceal the Sun that is in the centre of space. Indeed, then, space<br>itself, full of those fiery flames, burns in a vast conflagration. Then<br>Wind comes and takes the attribute, viz., form of Heat or Light, which<br>thereupon becomes extinguished, yielding to Wind, which, possessed of<br>great might, begins to be awfully agitated. The Wind, obtaining its own<br>attribute, viz., sound, begins to traverse upwards and downwards and<br>transversely along all the ten points. Then Space takes the attribute,<br>viz., sound of Wind, upon which the latter becomes extinguished and<br>enters into a phase of existence resembling that of unheard or unuttered<br>sound. Then Space is all that remains, that element whose attribute,<br>viz., sound dwells in all the other elements, divested of the attributes<br>of form, and taste, and touch, and scent, and without shape of any kind,<br>like sound in its unmanifest state of existence. Then sound, which is the<br>attribute of space, is swallowed up by Mind which is the essence of all<br>things that are manifest. Thus Mind which in itself is unmanifest<br>withdraws all that is manifested by Mind. This withdrawal of Mind as<br>displayed into Mind as undisplayed or subtile, is called the destruction<br>of the vast external universe.[892] Then Chandrama's having made Mind<br>(thus) withdraw its attribute into itself, swallows it up. When Mind,<br>ceasing to exist, thus enters into Chandramas, the other attributes that<br>are owned by Iswara are all that remain. This Chandramas, which is called<br>also Sankalpa, is then, after a very long time, brought under Iswara's<br>sway, then reason being that that Sankalpa has to perform a very<br>difficult act, viz., the destruction of Chitta or the faculties that are<br>employed in the process called judgment. When this has been effected, the<br>condition reached is said to be of high Knowledge. Then Time swallows up<br>this Knowledge, and as the Sruti declares, Time itself, in its turn, is<br>swallowed up by Might, or Energy. Might or energy, however, is (again)<br>swallowed up by Time, which last is then brought under her sway by Vidya.<br>Possessed of Vidya, Iswara then swallows up non-existence itself into his<br>Soul. That is Unmanifest and Supreme Brahma. That is Eternal, and that is<br>the Highest of the High. Thus all existent creatures are withdrawn into<br>Brahma. Truly hath this, which should be conceived (with the aid of the<br>scriptures) and which is a topic of Science, been thus declared by Yogins<br>possessed of Supreme Souls, after actual experience. Even thus doth the<br>Unmanifest Brahma repeatedly undergo the processes of Elaboration and<br>Withdrawal (i.e., Creation and Destruction), and even thus Brahman's Day<br>and Night each consist of a thousand yugas.'"[893]
