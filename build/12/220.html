                            "Yudhishthira said, 'By doing what does one acquire happiness, and what<br>is that by doing which one meets with woe? What also is that, O Bharata,<br>by doing which one becomes freed from fear and sojourns here crowned with<br>success (in respect of the objects of life)?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The ancients who had their understandings directed to the<br>Srutis, highly applauded the duty of self-restraint for all the orders<br>generally but for the. Brahmanas in especial. Success in respect of<br>religious rites never occurs in the case of one that is not<br>self-restrained. Religious rites, penances, truth,&#8212;all these are<br>established upon self-restraint. Self-restraint enhances one's energy.<br>Self-restraint is said to be sacred. The man of self-restraint becomes<br>sinless and fearless and wins great results. One that is self-restrained<br>sleeps happily and wakes happily. He sojourns happily in the world and<br>his mind always remains cheerful. Every kind of excitement is quietly<br>controlled by self-restraint. One that is not self-restrained fails in a<br>similar endeavour. The man of self-restraint beholds his innumerable foes<br>(in the form of lust, desire, and wrath, etc.), as if these dwell in a<br>separate body. Like tigers and other carnivorous beasts, persons<br>destitute of self-restraint always inspire all creatures with dread. For<br>controlling these men, the Self-born (Brahman) created kings. In all the<br>(four) modes of life, the practice or self-restraint is distinguished<br>above all other virtues. The fruits of self-restraint are much greater<br>than those obtainable in all the modes of life. I shall now mention to<br>thee the indications of those persons who prize self-restraint<br>highly.[829] They are nobility, calmness of disposition, contentment,<br>faith, forgiveness, invariable simplicity, the absence of garrulity,<br>humility, reverence for superiors, benevolence, compassion for all<br>creatures, frankness, abstention from talk upon kings and men in<br>authority, from all false and useless discourses, and from applause and<br>censure of others. The self-restrained man becomes desirous of<br>emancipation and, quietly bearing present joys and griefs, is never<br>exhilarated or depressed by prospective ones. Destitute of vindictiveness<br>and all kinds of guile, and unmoved by praise and blame, such a man is<br>well-behaved, has good manners, is pure of soul, has firmness or<br>fortitude, and is a complete master of his passions. Receiving honours in<br>this world, such a man in afterlife goes to heaven. Causing all creatures<br>to acquire what they cannot acquire without his aid, such a man rejoices<br>and becomes happy.[830] Devoted to universal benevolence, such a man<br>never cherishes animosity for any one. Tranquil like the ocean at a dead<br>calm, wisdom fills his soul and he is never cheerful. Possessed of<br>intelligence, and deserving of universal reverence, the man of<br>self-restraint never cherishes fear of any creature and is feared by no<br>creature in return. That man who never rejoices even at large<br>acquisitions and never feels sorrow when overtaken by calamity, is said<br>to be possessed of contented wisdom. Such a man is said to be<br>self-restrained. Indeed, such a man is said to be a regenerate being.<br>Versed with the scriptures and endued with a pure soul, the man of<br>self-restraint, accomplishing all those acts that are done by the good,<br>enjoys their high fruits. They, however, that are of wicked soul never<br>betake themselves to the path represented by benevolence, forgiveness,<br>tranquillity, contentment, sweetness of speech, truth, liberality and<br>comfort. Their path consists of lust and wrath and cupidity and envy of<br>others and boastfulness. Subjugating lust and wrath, practising the vow<br>of Brahmacharya and becoming a complete master of his senses, the<br>Brahmana, exerting himself with endurance in the austerest of penances,<br>and observing the most rigid restraints, should live in this world,<br>calmly waiting for his time like one seeming to have a body though fully<br>knowing that he is not subject to destruction.'"
