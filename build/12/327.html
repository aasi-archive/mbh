                            "Bhishma said, The next morning, king Janaka, O Bharata, accompanied by<br>his minister and the whole household, came to Suka, placing his priest in<br>the van. Bringing with him costly seats and diverse kinds of jewels and<br>gems, and bearing the ingredients of the Arghya on his own head, the<br>monarch approached the son of his reverend preceptor. The king, taking<br>with his own hands, from the hands of his priest, that seat adorned with<br>many gems, overlaid with an excellent sheet, beautiful in all its parts,<br>and exceedingly costly, presented it with great reverence to his<br>preceptor's son Suka. After the son of (the Island-born) Krishna had<br>taken his seat on it, the king worshipped him according to prescribed<br>rites. At first offering him water to wash his feet, he then presented<br>him the Arghya and kine. The ascetic accepted that worship offered with<br>due rites and mantras. That foremost of regenerate persons, having thus<br>accepted the worship offered by the king, and taking the kine also that<br>were presented to him, then saluted the monarch. Possessed of great<br>energy, he next enquired after the king's welfare and prosperity. Indeed,<br>O king, Suka embraced in his enquiry the welfare of the monarch's<br>followers and officers also. Receiving Suka's permission, Janaka sat down<br>with all his followers. Endued with a high soul and possessed of high<br>birth, the monarch, with joined hands, sat down on the bare ground and<br>enquired after the welfare and unabated prosperity of Vyasa's son. The<br>monarch then asked his guest the object of his visit.<br><br>"Suka said, Blessed be thou, my sire said unto me that his Yajamana, the<br>ruler of the Videhas, known all over the world by the name of Janaka, is<br>well-versed in the religion of Emancipation. He commanded me to come to<br>him without delay, if I had any doubts requiring solution in the matter<br>of the religion of either Pravritti or Nivritti. He gave me to understand<br>that the king of Mithila would dispel all my doubts. I have, therefore,<br>come hither, at the command of my sire, for the purpose of taking lessons<br>from thee. It behoveth thee, O foremost of all righteous persons, to<br>instruct me! What are the duties of a Brahmana, and what is the essence<br>of those duties that have Emancipation for their object. How also is<br>Emancipation to be obtained? Is it obtainable by the aid of knowledge or<br>by that of penances?<br><br>'Janaka said, Hear what the duties are of a Brahmana from the time of his<br>birth. After his investiture, O son, with the sacred-thread, he should<br>devote his attention to the study of the Vedas. By practising penances<br>and dutifully serving his preceptor and observing the duties of<br>Brahmacharyya, O puissant one, he should pay off the debt he owes to the<br>deities and the Pitris, and cast off all malice. Having studied the Vedas<br>with close attention and subjugated his senses, and having given his<br>preceptor the tuition fee, he should, with the permission of his<br>preceptor, return home. Returning home, he should betake himself to the<br>domestic mode of life and weeding a spouse confine himself to her, and<br>live freeing himself from every kind of malice, and having established<br>his domestic fire. Living in the domestic mode, he should procreate sons<br>and grandsons. After that, he should retire to the forest, and continue<br>to worship the same fires and entertain guests with cordial hospitality.<br>Living righteously in the forest, he should at last establish his fire in<br>his soul, and freed from all pairs of opposites, and casting off all<br>attachments from the soul, he should pass his days in the mode called<br>Sannyasa which is otherwise called the mode of Brahma.<br><br>"'Suka said, If one succeeds in attaining to an understanding cleansed by<br>study of the scriptures and to true conceptions of all things, and if the<br>heart succeeds in freeing itself permanently from the effects of all<br>pairs of opposites, is it still necessary for such a person to adopt, one<br>after another, the three modes of life called Brahmacharyya, Garhastya,<br>and Vanaprastha? This is what I ask thee. It behoveth thee to tell me.<br>Indeed, O ruler of men, do tell me this according to the true import of<br>the Vedas!<br><br>"'Janaka said, Without the aid of an understanding cleansed by study of<br>the scriptures and without that true conception of all things which is<br>known by the name of Vijnana, the attainment of Emancipation is<br>impossible. That cleansed understanding, again, it is said, is<br>unattainable without one's connection with a preceptor. The preceptor is<br>the helmsman, and knowledge is the boat (aided by whom and which one<br>succeeds in crossing the ocean of the world). After having acquired that<br>boat, one becomes crowned with success. Indeed, having crossed the'<br>ocean, one may abandon both. For preventing the destruction of all the<br>worlds and for preventing the destruction of acts (upon which the world<br>depend), the duties appertaining to the four modes of life were practised<br>by the wise of old. By abandoning acts, good and bad, agreeably to this<br>order of acts one succeeds, in course of many birth, in attaining to<br>Emancipation.[1739] That man who, through penances performed in course of<br>many births, succeeds in obtaining a cleansed mind and understanding and<br>soul, certainly becomes able to attain to Emancipation (in a new birth)<br>in even the very first mode viz., Brahmacharyya.[1740] When, having<br>attained to a cleansed understanding, Emancipation becomes his and in<br>consequence thereof he becomes possessed of knowledge in respect of all<br>visible things, what desirable object is there to attain by observing the<br>three other modes of life?[1741] One should always cast off faults born<br>of the attributes of Rajas and Tamas. Adhering to the path of Sattwa, one<br>should know Self by Self.[1742] Beholding one's self in all creatures and<br>all creatures in one's self, one should live (without being attached to<br>anything) like aquatic animals living in water without being drenched by<br>that element. He who succeeds in transcending all pairs of attributes and<br>resisting their influence, succeeds in casting off all attachments, and<br>attains to infinite felicity in the next world, going thither like a bird<br>soaring into the sky from below. In this connection, there is a saying<br>sung of old by king Yayati and borne in remembrance, O sire, by all<br>persons conversant with the scriptures bearing upon Emancipation. The<br>effulgent ray (i.e., the Supreme Soul) exists in one's Soul and not<br>anywhere else. It exists equally in all creatures. One can see it oneself<br>if one's heart be devoted to Yoga. When a person lives in such a way that<br>another is not inspired with fear at his sight, and when a person is not<br>himself inspired with fear at the sight of others, when a person ceases<br>to cherish desire and hate, he is then said to attain to Brahma. When a<br>person ceases to entertain a sinful attitude towards all creatures in<br>thought, word, and deed, he is then said to attain to Brahma.[1743] By<br>restraining the mind and the soul, by casting off malice that stupefies<br>the mind, and by throwing off desire and stupefaction, one is said to<br>attain to Brahma. When a person assumes an equality of attitude in<br>respect of all objects of hearing and vision (and the operations of the<br>other senses) as also in respect of all living creatures, and transcends<br>all pairs of opposites, he is then said to attain to Brahma. When person<br>casts an equal eye upon praise and dispraise, gold and iron, happiness<br>and misery, heat and cold, good and evil, the agreeable and the<br>disagreeable, life and death, he is then said to attain to Brahma. One<br>observing the duties of the mendicant orders should restrain one's senses<br>and the mind even like a tortoise withdrawing its out-stretched<br>limbs.[1744] As a house enveloped in darkness is capable of being seen<br>with the aid of a lighted lamp, after the same manner can the soul be<br>seen with the aid of the lamp of the understanding. O foremost of<br>intelligent persons, I see that all this knowledge that I am<br>communicating to thee dwells in thee. Whatever else should be known by<br>one desirous of learning the religion of Emancipation is already known to<br>thee. O regenerate Rishi, I am convinced that through the grace of thy<br>preceptor and through the instructions thou hast received, thou hast<br>already transcended all objects of the senses.[1745] O great ascetic,<br>through the grace of that sire of thine, I have attained to omniscience,<br>and hence I have succeeded in knowing thee. Thy knowledge is much greater<br>than what thou thinkest thou hast. Thy perceptions also that result from<br>intuition are much greater than what thou thinkest thou hast. Thy<br>puissance also is much greater than thou art conscious of. Whether in<br>consequence of thy tender age, or of the doubts thou hast not been able<br>to dispel, or of the fear that is due to the unattainment of<br>Emancipation, thou art not conscious of that knowledge due to intuition<br>although it has arisen in thy mind. After one's doubts have been<br>dispelled by persons like us, one succeeds in opening the knots of one's<br>heart and then, by a righteous exertion one attains to and becomes<br>conscious of that knowledge. As regards thyself, thou art one that hast<br>already acquired knowledge. Thy intelligence is steady and tranquil. Thou<br>art free from covetousness. For all that, O Brahmana, one never succeeds<br>in attaining to Brahma, which is the highest object of acquisition,<br>without exertion. Thou seest no distinction between happiness and misery.<br>Thou art not covetous. Thou hast no longing for dancing and song. Thou<br>hast no attachments. Thou hast no attachment to friends. Thou hast no<br>fear in things that inspire fear. O blessed one, I see that thou castest<br>an equal eye upon a lump of gold and a clod of earth. Myself and other<br>persons possessed of wisdom, behold thee established in the highest and<br>indestructible path of tranquillity. Thou stayest, O Brahmana, in those<br>duties which obtain for the Brahmana that fruit which should be his and<br>which is identical with the essence of the object represented by<br>Emancipation. What else hast thou to ask me?'"
