                            "Suka said, 'O illustrious one, O foremost of Rishis, once again<br>discourse to me on Adhyatma more elaborately. Tell me what, indeed, is<br>Adhyatma and whence does it come?'[1041]<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'That, O son, which is regarded as Adhyatma with reference<br>to human beings, I shall now mention to thee, and listen to the<br>explanation I give (of Adhyatma). Earth, water, light, wind, and space,<br>are the great entities that form the component parts of all creatures,<br>and, though really one, are yet regarded different like the waves of the<br>ocean (which though identical with respect to their constituent substance<br>are yet counted as different from one another). Like a tortoise<br>stretching out its limbs and withdrawing them again, the great entities<br>(already named), by dwelling in numberless small forms, undergo<br>transformations (called creation and destruction). All this universe of<br>mobile and immobile objects hath for its component parts these five<br>entities. Everything, in respect of its creation and destruction, is<br>referable to this fivefold entity. These five entities occur in all<br>existent things. The Creator of all things, however, hath made an unequal<br>distribution of those entities (by placing them in different things in<br>different proportions) for serving different ends.'[1042]<br><br>"Suka said, 'How may one succeed in understanding that unequal<br>distribution (of the five great entities of which thou speakest) in the<br>diverse things of the universe? Which amongst them are the senses and<br>which the attributes? How may this be understood?'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'I shall explain thee this duly one after another. Listen<br>with concentrated attention to the subject as I expound how what I have<br>said actually happens. Sound, the sense of hearing, and all the cavities<br>within the body,&#8212;these three&#8212;have space for their origin. The vital<br>breaths, the action of the limbs and touch form the attributes of the<br>wind. Form, eyes, and the digestive fire within the stomach, are<br>originated by light. Taste, tongue, and all the humours,&#8212;these<br>three,&#8212;are from water. Scent, nose, and the body,&#8212;these three,&#8212;are the<br>attributes of earth. These, then, as I have expounded to thee, are the<br>transformations of the five (great) entities with senses. Touch is said<br>to be the attribute of the wind; taste of water; form of light. Sound is<br>said to have its origin in space, and scent is said to be the property of<br>earth. Mind, Understanding, and Nature,&#8212;these three,&#8212;spring from their<br>own previous states, and attaining (at each rebirth) to a position higher<br>than the attributes (which form their respective objects), do not<br>transcend those attributes.[1043] As the tortoise stretches out its limbs<br>and withdraws them once again within itself, even so the Understanding<br>creates the senses and once again withdraws them into itself.[1044] The<br>consciousness of personal identity that arises in respect of that which<br>is above the soles of the feet and below the crown of the head, is<br>principally due to the action of the Understanding.[1045] It is the<br>understanding that is transformed into the (five) attributes (of form,<br>scent, etc.). It is understanding also that is transformed into the<br>(five) senses with the mind for the sixth. When the Understanding is<br>absent, where are the attributes?[1046] In man there are five senses. The<br>mind is called the sixth (sense). The Understanding is called the<br>seventh. The Soul is the eighth. The eyes (and the other senses) are for<br>only receiving impressions of form (and scent, etc.). The mind exists for<br>doubting (the accuracy of those impressions). The Understanding settles<br>those doubts. The Soul is said only to witness every operation without<br>mingling with them. Rajas, Tamas, and Sattwa,&#8212;these three,&#8212;arise from<br>their own counterparts. These exist equal in all creatures (viz., the<br>deities and human beings, etc.). These are called attributes and should<br>be known by the actions they induce.[1047] As regards those actions all<br>such states in which one becomes conscious of oneself as united with<br>cheerfulness or joy and which are tranquil and pure, should be known as<br>due to the attribute of Sattwa. All such states in either the body or the<br>mind, as are united with sorrow, should be regarded as due to the<br>influence of the attribute called Rajas. All such states again as exist<br>with stupefication (of the senses, the mind or the understanding) whose<br>cause is unascertainable, and which are incomprehensible (by either<br>reasons or inward light), should be known as ascribable to the action of<br>Tamas. Delight, cheerfulness, joy, equanimity, contentment of heart, due<br>to any known cause or arising otherwise, are all effects of the attribute<br>of Sattwa. Pride, untruthfulness of speech, cupidity, stupefication,<br>vindictiveness, whether arising from any known cause or otherwise, are<br>indications of the quality of Rajas. Stupefaction of judgment,<br>heedlessness, sleep, lethargy, and indolence, from whatever cause these<br>may arise, are to be known as indications of the quality of Tamas.'"[1048]
