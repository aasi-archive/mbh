                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, the indications of future<br>greatness and future fall in respect of a person.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The mind itself, blessed be thou, indicates the<br>premonitory symptoms of one's future prosperity and future fall. In this<br>connection is cited the old story of the discourse between Sree and<br>Sakra. Listen to it, O Yudhishthira! The great ascetic Narada, of energy<br>whose effulgence is as immeasurable as Brahma itself, with sins all<br>destroyed, capable of beholding through the prosperity of his penances<br>both this and the other world at once, and the equal of the celestial<br>Rishis in the region of the Creator, roved according to his pleasure<br>through the triple world. One day, rising up at dawn, he wished to<br>perform his ablutions, and for that purpose went to the river Ganga as<br>she issued out of the pass known by the name of Dhruva and plunged into<br>the stream.[858] At that time the thousand-eyed Indra also, the wielder<br>of the thunderbolt, and the slayer of Samvara and Paka, came to the very<br>bank where Narada was. The Rishi and the deity, both of souls under<br>perfect command, finished their ablutions, and having completed their<br>silent recitations, sat together. They employed the hour in reciting and<br>listening to the excellent narratives told by the great celestial Rishis<br>descriptive of many good and high deeds. Indeed, with concentrated<br>attention the two were engaged in such pleasant discourse on ancient<br>history.[859] While sitting there they beheld the rising Sun casting his<br>thousand rays right before him. Seeing the full orb, both of them stood<br>up and hymned his praises. Just at that time they beheld in the sky, in a<br>direction opposite to that of the rising star of day, some luminous<br>object, resplendent as blazing fire and that seemed to be a second star<br>of day. And they saw, O Bharata, that that luminous object was gradually<br>approaching towards them both. Riding upon Vishnu's vehicle adorned with<br>Garuda and Surya himself, that object blazed forth with unrivalled<br>splendour, and seemed to illumine the three worlds. The object they saw<br>was none other than Sree herself, attended by many Apsaras endued with<br>splendid beauty. Indeed, she looked like a large solar disc herself,<br>possessed of effulgence resembling that of fire. Adorned with ornaments<br>that looked like veritable stars, she wore a wreath that resembled a<br>garland of pearls. Indra saw that goddess called Padma having her<br>habitation in the midst of lotuses. Descending from her foremost of cars,<br>that unrivalled lady began to approach towards the lord of the three<br>worlds and the celestial Rishi Narada. Followed by Narada, Maghavat also<br>proceeded towards that lady. With joined hands, he offered himself up to<br>her, and versed as he was with all things, he worshipped her with<br>reverence and sincerity never surpassed. The adorations over, the lord of<br>celestials, O king, addressed Sree in the following words.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'O thou of sweet smiles, who, indeed, art thou and for what<br>business hast thou come here? O thou of fair brows, whence dost thou come<br>and whither wilt thou proceed, O auspicious lady?'<br><br>"Sree said, 'In the three worlds full of the seeds of auspiciousness, all<br>creatures, mobile and immobile, strive with their whole hearts to win an<br>association with me. I am that Padma, that Sree decked with lotuses, who<br>sprang from the lotus that blooms at the touch of the rays of Surya, for<br>the prosperity of all creatures. I am called Lakshmi, Bhuti, and Sree, O<br>slayer of Vala! I am Faith, I am Intelligence, I am Affluence, I am<br>Victory, and I am Immutability. I am Patience, I am Success, I am<br>Prosperity. I am Swaha, I am Swadha, I am Reverence, I am Fate, and I am<br>Memory. I dwell at the van and on the standards of victorious and<br>virtuous sovereigns, as also in their homes and cities and dominions. I<br>always reside, O slayer of Vala, with those foremost of men, viz., heroes<br>panting after victory and unretreating from battle. I also reside for<br>ever with persons that are firmly attached to virtue, that are endued<br>with great intelligence, that are devoted to Brahma, that are truthful in<br>speech, that are possessed of humility, and that are liberal. Formerly, I<br>dwelt with the Asuras in consequence of my disposition of being bound by<br>truth and merit Seeing, however, that the Asuras have assumed adverse<br>natures, I have left then and wish to reside in thee.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'O thou of fair face, in consequence of what behaviour of<br>the Asuras didst thou dwell with them? What didst thou see there for<br>which thou hast come hither, having deserted the Daityas and the Danavas?'<br><br>"Sree said, I attach myself steadfastly to those that are devoted to the<br>duties of their own order, to those that never fall away from patience,<br>to those that take a pleasure in walking along the path which leads to<br>heaven. I always reside with those that are distinguished for liberality,<br>for study of the scriptures, for sacrifices, for other scriptural rites,<br>and for worship of Pitris, deities, preceptors, seniors, and guests.<br>Formerly, the Danavas used to keep their abodes clean, to keep their<br>women under control, to pour libations on the sacrificial fire, to wait<br>dutifully on their preceptors, to restrain their passions, to be obedient<br>to the Brahmanas, and to be truthful in speech. They were full of faith;<br>they kept their wrath under control; they practised the virtue of<br>charity; they never envied others; they used to maintain their friends<br>and advisers, and their spouses; they were never jealous. Formerly, they<br>never assailed one another, filled with wrath. They were all contented<br>and never felt pain at the sight of other people's affluence and<br>prosperity. They were all charitable and economical; of respectable<br>conduct, and endued with compassion. They were excessively inclined to<br>grace, possessed of simplicity of conduct, steadfast in faith, and had<br>their passions under complete control. They used to keep their servants<br>and counsellors contented, and were grateful and endued with sweet<br>speech. They used to serve every one as each deserved in consequence of<br>his position and honour. They were endued with shame. They were of rigid<br>vows. They used to perform their ablutions on every sacred day. They used<br>to smear themselves properly with perfumes and suspicious unguents. They<br>were also to adorn their persons duly. They were observant of fasts and<br>penances, were trustful, and utterers of Vedic hymns. The Sun never rose<br>upon them while they lay asleep. They never outslept the moon. They<br>always abstained from curds and pounded barley. They used every morning<br>to look at clarified butter and other auspicious articles, and with<br>senses withdrawn they used to recite the Vedas and worship Brahmanas with<br>gifts. Their discourse was always virtuous, and they never accepted<br>gifts. They always went to sleep at midnight and never slept during the<br>day. They always used to take pleasure in showing compassion for the<br>distressed, the helpless, the aged, the weak, the sick, and women, and<br>enjoyed all their possessions by sharing these with them. They always<br>used to assume and comfort the agitated, the cheerless, the anxious, the<br>terrified, the diseased, the weak and emaciated, the robbed, and the<br>afflicted. They followed the dictates of virtue and never injured one<br>another. They were ready and well-disposed for action of every kind (that<br>deserved to be accomplished). They used to serve and wait with reverence<br>upon seniors and aged individuals. They duly worshipped Pitris, deities,<br>and guests, and ate every day what was left after gratifying these. They<br>were firmly devoted to truth and penances. None amongst them ate singly<br>any food that was good, and none had congress with other people's wives.<br>As regards compassion, they behaved towards all creatures as towards<br>their own selves. They never allowed the emission of the vital seed into<br>empty space, into inferior animals, into forbidden wombs, or on sacred<br>days. They were always distinguished for gifts, for cleverness, for<br>simplicity, for hopeful exertion, for humility, for friendliness, and for<br>forgiveness. And, O puissant one, truth, charity, penance, purity,<br>compassion, soft speeches and absence of animosity towards friends,&#8212;all<br>these were always in them. Slumber, procrastination, fretfulness, envy,<br>and want of foresight, discontent, melancholy, cupidity never assailed<br>them. In consequence of the Danavas having been distinguished for these<br>good qualities, I dwelt with them from the beginning of the creation for<br>many yugas together. Times were altered, and that alteration brought<br>about an alteration in the character of the Danavas. I saw that virtue<br>and morality deserted them and they began to own the sway of lust and<br>wrath. Persons, though themselves inferior in attainments, began to<br>cherish animosities towards seniors in age possessed of superior<br>qualifications, and while the latter, possessed of virtue and merit, used<br>to speak upon proper topics in the midst of assemblies, the former began<br>to ridicule or laugh at them. When reverend seniors in age came, the<br>younger individuals, seated at their ease, refused to adore the former by<br>rising up and saluting them with respect. In the presence of sires, sons<br>began to exercise power (in matters that concerned sires alone). They<br>that were not in receipt of wages accepted service and shamelessly<br>proclaimed the fact, Those amongst them that succeeded in amassing great<br>wealth by doing unrighteous and censurable deeds came to be held in<br>esteem.[860] During the night they began to indulge in loud screams and<br>shrieks. Their homa fires ceased to send bright and upward flames. Sons<br>began to lord it over sires, and wives dominated over husbands. Mothers,<br>fathers, aged seniors, preceptors, guests, and guides ceased to command<br>respect for their superior status. People ceased to bring up with<br>affection their own offspring but began to desert them. Without giving<br>away the defined portion in alms and reserving the fixed portion for<br>offering it unto the gods, every one ate what he had. Indeed, without<br>offering their goods to the deities in sacrifices and without sharing<br>them with the Pitris, the gods, guests, and reverend seniors, they<br>appropriated them to their own use shamelessly. Their cooks no longer<br>professed any consideration for purity of mind, deed, and word. They ate<br>what had been left uncovered. Their corn lay scattered in yards, exposed<br>to devastation by crows and rats. Their milk remained exposed, and they<br>began to touch clarified butter with hands unwashed after eating.[861]<br>Their spades, domestic knives, baskets, and dishes and cups of white<br>brass, and other utensils began to lie scattered in their houses. Their<br>housewives abstained from looking after these. They no longer attained to<br>the repairs of their houses and walls. Tethering their animals they<br>abstained from giving them food and drink.[862] Disregarding children<br>that only looked on, and without having fed their dependants, the Danavas<br>ate what they had. They began to prepare payasa and krisara and dishes of<br>meat and cakes and sashkuli (not for gods and guests) but for their own<br>slaves, and commenced to eat the flesh of animals not killed in<br>sacrifices.[863] They used to sleep even after the sun had risen. They<br>made night of their morns. Day and night disputes and quarrels waxed in<br>every house of theirs. They that were not respectable amongst them no<br>longer showed any respect for those that deserve respect while the latter<br>were seated in any place. Fallen off from their defined duties, they<br>ceased to reverence those that had betaken themselves to the woods for<br>leading a life of peace and divine contemplation. Intermixture of castes<br>freely commenced among them. They ceased to attend to purity of person or<br>mind. Brahmanas learned in the Vedas ceased to command respect among<br>them. Those again that were ignorant of Richs were not condemned or<br>punished. Both were treated on a footing of equality, those, that is,<br>that deserved respect and those that deserved no respect. Their servant<br>girls became wicked in behaviour, and began to wear necklaces of gold and<br>other ornaments and fine robes, and used to remain in their houses or go<br>away before their very eyes. They began to derive great pleasure from<br>sports and diversions in which their women were dressed as men and their<br>men as women. Those amongst their ancestors that were affluent had made<br>gifts of wealth unto deserving persons. The descendants of the donors,<br>even when in prosperous conditions, began to resume, for their unbelief,<br>those gifts. When difficulties threatened the accomplishment of any<br>purpose and friend sought the counsel of friend, that purpose was<br>frustrated by the latter even if he had any interest of the slightest<br>value to subserve by frustrating it. Amongst even their better classes<br>have appeared traders and dealers in goods, intent upon taking the wealth<br>of others. The Sudras amongst them have taken to the practice of<br>penances. Some amongst them have begun to study, without making any rules<br>for regulating their hours and food. Others have begun to study, making<br>rules that are useless. Disciples have abstained from rendering obedience<br>and service to preceptors. Preceptors again have come to treat disciples<br>as friendly companions. Fathers and mothers are worn out with work, and<br>have abstained from indulging in festivities. Parents in old age,<br>divested of power over sons, have been forced to beg their food of the<br>latter. Amongst them, even persons of wisdom, conversant with the Vedas,<br>and resembling the ocean itself in gravity of deportment, have begun to<br>betake themselves to agriculture and such other pursuits. Persons who are<br>illiterate and ignorant have begun to be fed at Sraddhas.[864] Every<br>morning, disciples, instead of approaching preceptors for making dutiful<br>enquiries for ascertaining what acts awaited accomplishment and for<br>seeking commissions which they are to discharge, are themselves waited<br>upon by preceptors who discharge those functions. Daughters-in-law, in<br>the presence of their husbands' mothers and fathers, rebuke and chastise<br>servants and maids, and summoning their husband's lecture and rebuke<br>them. Sires, with great care, seek to keep sons in good humour, or<br>dividing through fear their wealth among children, live in woe and<br>affliction.[865] Even persons enjoying the friendship of the victims,<br>beholding the latter deprived of wealth in conflagrations or by robbers<br>or by the king, have begun to indulge in laughter from feelings of<br>mockery. They have become ungrateful and unbelieving and sinful and<br>addicted to adulterous congress with even the spouses of their<br>preceptors. They have betaken themselves to eating forbidden food. They<br>have transgressed all bounds and restraints. They have become divested of<br>that splendour which had distinguished them before. In consequence of<br>these and other indications of wicked conduct and the reversal of their<br>former nature, I shall not, O chief of the gods, dwell among them any<br>longer. I have, therefore, come to thee of my own accord. Receive me with<br>respect, O lord of Sachi! Honoured by thee, O chief of the celestials, I<br>shall receive honour from all other deities. There, where I reside, the<br>seven other goddesses with Jaya for their eighth, who love me, who are<br>inseparably associated with me, and who depend upon me, desire to live.<br>They are Hope, Faith, Intelligence, Contentment, Victory, Advancement,<br>and Forgiveness. She who forms the eighth, viz., Jaya, occupies the<br>foremost place amongst them, O chastiser of Paka. All of them and myself,<br>having deserted the Asuras, have come to thy domains. We shall henceforth<br>reside among the deities who are devoted to righteousness and faith.<br><br>"After the goddess had said so, the celestial Rishi Narada, and Vasava,<br>the slayer of Vritra, for gladdening her, offered her a joyful welcome.<br>The god of wind,&#8212;that friend of Agni, then began to blow gently through<br>heaven, bearing delicious odours, refreshing all creatures with whom he<br>came into contact, and contributing to the felicity of every one of the<br>senses. All the deities (hearing the news) assembled together in a pure<br>and desirable spot and waited there in expectation of beholding Maghavat<br>seated with Lakshmi beside him. Then the thousand-eyed chief of the gods,<br>accompanied by Sree and his friend the great Rishi, and riding upon a<br>splendid car drawn by green horses, came into that assembly of the<br>celestials, receiving honour from all. Then the great Rishi Narada, whose<br>prowess was known to all the celestials, observing a sign that the<br>wielder of the thunderbolt made and which Sree herself approved of,<br>welcomed the advent of the goddess there and proclaimed it as exceedingly<br>auspicious. Heaven's firmament became clear and bright and began to<br>shower nectar upon the region of the self-born Grandsire. The celestial<br>kettle-drums, though struck by none, began to beat, and all the points of<br>the horizon, becoming clear, seemed ablaze with splendour. Indra began to<br>pour rain upon crops that commenced to appear each at its proper season.<br>No one then deviated from the path of righteousness. The earth became<br>adorned with many mines filled with jewels and gems, and the chant of<br>Vedic recitations and other melodious sounds swelled up on the occasion<br>of that triumph of the celestials. Human beings, endued with firm minds,<br>and all adhering to the auspicious path that is trod by the righteous,<br>began to take pleasure in Vedic and other religious rites and acts. Men<br>and gods and Kinnaras and Yakshas and Rakshasas all became endued with<br>prosperity and cheerfulness. Not a flower,&#8212;what need then be said of<br>fruits,&#8212;dropped untimely from a tree even if the god of wind shook it<br>with force. All the kine began to yield sweet milk whenever milked by<br>men, and cruel and harsh words ceased to be uttered by any one. They who,<br>from desire of advancement, approach before assemblies of Brahmanas, and<br>read this narrative of the glorification of Sree by all the deities with<br>Indra at their head, deities that are competent to grant every<br>wish,&#8212;succeed in winning great prosperity. These then O chief of the<br>Kurus, are the foremost indications of prosperity and adversity. Urged on<br>by thee, I have told thee all. It behoves thee to bear thyself according<br>to the instructions conveyed herein, understanding them after careful<br>reflection!'
