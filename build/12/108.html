                            "Yudhishthira said, 'The path of duty is long. It has also, O Bharata,<br>many branches. What, however, according to thee, are those duties that<br>most deserve to be practised? What acts, according to thee, are the most<br>important among all duties, by the practice of which I may earn the<br>highest merit both here and hereafter?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The worship of mother, father, and preceptor is most<br>important according to me. The man who attends to that duty here,<br>succeeds in acquiring great fame and many regions of felicity. Worshipped<br>with respect by thee, whatever they will command thee, be it consistent<br>with righteousness or in consistent with it, should be done<br>unhesitatingly, O Yudhishthira! One should never do what they forbid.<br>Without doubt, that which they command should always be done.[332] They<br>are the three worlds. They are the three modes of life. They are the<br>three Vedas. They are the three sacred fires. The father is said to be<br>the Garhapatya fire; the mother, the Dakshina fire, and the preceptor is<br>that fire upon which libations are poured. These three fires are, of<br>course, the most eminent. If thou attendest with heedfulness to these<br>three fires, thou wilt succeed in conquering the three worlds. By serving<br>the father with regularity, one may cross this world. By serving the<br>mother in the same way, one may attain to regions of felicity in the<br>next. By serving the preceptor with regularity one may obtain the region<br>of Brahma. Behave properly towards these three, O Bharata, thou shalt<br>then obtain great fame in the three worlds, and blessed be thou, great<br>will be thy merit and reward. Never transgress them in any act. Never eat<br>before they eat, nor eat anything that is better than what thy eat. Never<br>impute any fault to them. One should always serve them with humility.<br>That is an act of high merit. By acting in that way, O best of kings,<br>thou mayst obtain fame, merit, honour, and regions of felicity hereafter.<br>He who honours these three is honoured in all the worlds. He, on the<br>other hand, who disregards these three, falls to obtain any merit from<br>any of his acts. Such a man, O scorcher of foes, acquires merit neither<br>in this world nor in the next. He who always disregards these three<br>seniors never obtains fame either here or hereafter. Such a man never<br>earns any good in the next world. All that I have given away in honour of<br>those three has become a hundredfold or a thousandfold of its actual<br>measure. It is in consequence of that merit that even now, O<br>Yudhishthira, the three worlds are clearly before my eyes. One Acharya is<br>superior to ten Brahmanas learned in the Vedas. One Upadhyaya is again<br>superior to ten Acharyas. The father, again, is superior to ten<br>Upadhyayas. The mother again, is superior to ten fathers, or perhaps, the<br>whole world, in importance. There is no one that deserves such reverence<br>as the mother. In my opinion, however, the preceptor is worthy of greater<br>reverence than the father or even the mother. The father and the mother<br>are authors of one's being. The father and the mother, O Bharata, only<br>create the body. The life, on the other hand, that one obtains from one's<br>preceptor, is heavenly. That life is subject to no decay and is immortal.<br>The father and the mother, however much they may offend, should never be<br>slain. By not punishing a father and a mother, (even if they deserve<br>punishment), one does not incur sin. Indeed, such reverend persons, by<br>enjoying impunity, do not stain the king. The gods and the Rishis do not<br>withhold their favours from such persons as strive to cherish even their<br>sinful fathers with reverence. He who favours a person by imparting to<br>him true instruction, by communicating the Vedas, and giving knowledge<br>which is immortal, should be regarded as both a father and a mother. The<br>disciple, in grateful recognition of what the instructor has done, should<br>never do anything that would injure the latter. They that do not<br>reverence their preceptors after receiving instruction from them by<br>obeying them dutifully in thought and deed, incur the sin of killing a<br>foetus. There is no sinner in this world like them.[333] Preceptors<br>always show great affection for their disciples. The latter should,<br>therefore, show their preceptors commensurate reverence. He, therefore,<br>that wishes to earn that high merit which has existed from ancient days,<br>should worship and adore his preceptors and cheerfully share with them<br>every object of enjoyment. With him who pleases his father is pleased<br>Prajapati himself. He who pleases his mother gratifies the earth herself.<br>He who pleases his preceptor gratifies Brahma by his act. For this<br>reason, the preceptor is worthy of greater reverence than either the<br>father or the mother. If preceptors are worshipped, the very Rishis, and<br>the gods, together with the Pitris, are all pleased. Therefore, the<br>preceptor is worthy of the highest reverence. The preceptor should never<br>be disregarded in any manner by the disciple. Neither the mother nor the<br>father deserves such regard as the preceptor. The father, the mother, and<br>the preceptor, should never be insulted. No act of theirs should be found<br>fault with. The gods and the great Rishis are pleased with him that<br>behaves with reverence towards his preceptors. They that injure in<br>thought and deed their preceptors, or fathers, or mothers, incur the sin<br>of killing a foetus. There is no sinner in the world equal to them. That<br>son of the sire's loins and the mother's womb, who, being brought up by<br>them and when he comes to age, does not support them in his turn, incurs<br>the sin of killing a foetus. There is no sinner in the world like unto<br>him. We have never heard that these four, viz., he who injures a friend,<br>he who is ungrateful, he who slays a woman, and he who slays a preceptor,<br>ever succeed in cleansing themselves. I have now told thee generally all<br>that a person should do in this world. Besides those duties that I have<br>indicated, there is nothing productive of greater felicity. Thinking of<br>all duties, I have told thee their essence.'"
