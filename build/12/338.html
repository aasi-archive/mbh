                            "Yudhishthira said, 'When the great king Vasu was so wholly devoted to<br>Narayana, for what reason then did he fall down from heaven and why again<br>had he to sink beneath the surface of the Earth?"<br><br>'Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited an old narrative, O Bharata,<br>of a discourse between the Rishis and the gods. The gods, once on a time,<br>addressing many foremost of Brahmanas, said unto them that sacrifices<br>should be performed by offering up Ajas as victims. By the word Aja<br>should be understood the goat and no other animal.'<br><br>The Rishis said, The Vedic Sruti declares that in sacrifices the<br>offerings should consist of (vegetable) seeds. Seeds are called Ajas. It<br>behoveth you not to slay goats. Ye deities, that cannot be the religion<br>of good and righteous people in which slaughter of animals is laid down.<br>This, again, is the Krita age. How can animals be slaughtered in this<br>epoch of righteousness?'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, While this discourse was going between the Rishis and<br>the deities, that foremost of kings, viz., Vasu, was seen to come that<br>way. Endued with great prosperity, the king was coming through the<br>welkin, accompanied by his troops and vehicles and animals. Beholding<br>king Vasu coming to that spot through the skies, the Brahmanas addressing<br>the deities, said,&#8212;This one will remove our doubts. He performs<br>sacrifices. He is liberal in making gifts. He always seeks the good of<br>all creatures. How, indeed, will the great Vasu, speak otherwise,&#8212;Having<br>thus spoken unto each other, the deities and the Rishis quickly<br>approached king Vasu and questioned him, saying,&#8212;O king, with what<br>should one perform sacrifices? Should one sacrifice with the goat or with<br>herbs and plants? Do thou dispel this doubt of ours. We constitute thee<br>our judge in this matter.&#8212;Thus addressed by them, Vasu joined his hands<br>in humility and said unto them.&#8212;Tell me truly, ye foremost of Brahmanas,<br>what opinion is entertained by you in this matter?<br><br>"'The Rishis said, The opinion entertained by us, O king, is that<br>sacrifices should be performed with grain. The deities, however, maintain<br>that sacrifices should be performed with animals. Do thou judge between<br>us and tell us which of these opinions is correct.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Learning what the opinion was that was entertained<br>by the deities, Vasu, moved by partiality for them, said that sacrifices<br>should be performed with animals. At this answer, all the Rishis, endued<br>with the splendour of the Sun, became very angry. Addressing Vasu who was<br>seated on his car and who had (wrongly) taken up the side of the deities,<br>they said unto him,&#8212;Since thou hast (wrongly) taken up the side of the<br>deities, do thou fall down from heaven. From this day, O monarch, thou<br>shalt lose the power of journeying through the sky. Through our course,<br>thou shalt sink deep below the surface of the Earth. After the Rishis had<br>said these words, king Uparichara immediately fell down, O monarch, and<br>went down a hole in Earth. At the command, however, of Narayana, Vasu's<br>memory did not leave him. To the good fortune of Vasu, the deities,<br>pained at the course denounced on him by the Brahmanas, began to think<br>anxiously as to how that course might be neutralised. They said, This<br>high-souled king hath been cursed for our sake. We, denizens of heaven,<br>should unite together for doing what is good to him in return for that<br>which he has done to us. Having quickly settled this in their minds with<br>the aid of reflection, the deities proceeded to the spot where the king<br>Uparichara was. Arrived, at his presence, they addressed him, saying,<br>Thou art devoted to the great God of the Brahmanas (viz., Narayana). That<br>great Lord of both the deities and the Asuras, gratified with thee, will<br>rescue thee from the course that has been denounced upon thee. It is<br>proper, however, that the high-souled Brahmanas should be honoured.<br>Verily, O best of kings, their penances should fructify.[1813] Indeed,<br>thou hast already fallen down from the sky on the Earth. We desire,<br>however, O best of kings, to show thee a favour in one respect. As long<br>as thou, O sinless one, shalt dwell in his hole, so long shalt thou<br>receive (due sustenance, through our boon)! Those streaks of clarified<br>butter which Brahmans with concentrated minds pour in sacrifices in<br>accompaniment with sacred mantras, and which are called by the name of<br>Vasudhara, shall be thine, through our care for thee! Indeed weakness or<br>distress shall not touch thee.[1814] While dwelling, O king of kings, in<br>the hole of the Earth, neither hunger nor thirst shall afflict thee for<br>thou shalt drink those streaks of clarified butter called Vasudhara. Thy<br>energy also shall continue unabated. In consequence also of this our boon<br>that we grant thee, the God of gods, viz., Narayana will be gratified<br>with thee, and He will bear thee hence to the region of Brahman!&#8212;Having<br>granted these boons unto the king, the denizens of heaven, as also all<br>those Rishis possessed of wealth of penances, returned each to his<br>respective place. Then Vasu, O Bharata, began to adore the Creator of the<br>universe and to recite in silence those sacred mantras that had come out<br>of Narayana's mouth in days of yore.[1815] Although dwelling in a pit of<br>the Earth, the king still worshipped Hari, the Lord of all the deities,<br>in the well-known five sacrifices that are performed five times every<br>day, O slayer of foes! In consequence of these adorations, Narayana,<br>otherwise called Hari, became highly pleased with him who thus showed<br>himself to be entirely devoted to Him, by wholly relying upon Him as his<br>sole refuge, and who had completely subjugated his senses. The<br>illustrious Vishnu, that giver of boons, then addressing Garuda of great<br>speed, that foremost of birds, who waited upon Him as his servant, said<br>these desirable words:&#8212;O foremost of birds, O thou that art highly<br>blessed, listen to what I say! There is a great king of the name of Vasu<br>who is of righteous soul and rigid vows. Through the wrath of the<br>Brahmanas, he has fallen into a pit of the Earth. The Brahmans, have been<br>sufficiently honoured (for their curse has fructified). Do thou go to<br>that king now. At my command, O Garuda, go to that foremost of kings,<br>viz., Uparichara who is now dwelling in a whole of the Earth and<br>incapable of any longer sailing through the sky, and bring him up without<br>delay into the welkin. Hearing these words of Vishnu, Garuda, spreading<br>his wings and rushing with the speed of the wind, entered that hole in<br>the Earth in which king Vasu was living. Suddenly taking the king up, the<br>son of Vinata soared into the sky and there released the king from his<br>beaks. At that moment, king Uparichara once more acquired his celestial<br>form and re-entered the region of Brahman. It was in this way, O son of<br>Kunti, that great king first fell down through the curse of the Brahmanas<br>for a fault of speech, and once more ascended to heaven at the command of<br>the great God (Vishnu). Only the puissant Lord Hari, that foremost of all<br>Beings, was devoutly worshipped by him. It was for this devout worship<br>that the king succeeded very soon in escaping from the curse denounced<br>upon him by the Brahmanas and in regaining the felicitous regions of<br>Brahman.<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'I have thus told thee everything respecting the<br>origin of the spiritual sons of Brahman. Listen to me with undivided<br>attention, for I shall now narrate to thee how the celestial Rishi Narada<br>proceeded in days of yore to White Island.'"
