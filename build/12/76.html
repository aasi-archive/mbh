                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, amongst Brahmanas some are engaged in<br>the duties proper to their order, while others are engaged in other<br>duties. Tell me the difference between these two classes!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Those Brahmanas, O king, that are possessed of learning<br>and beneficent features, and that look upon all creatures with an equal<br>eye, are said to be equal to Brahma. They that are conversant with the<br>Riches, the Yajuses and the Samans, and who are devoted to the practices<br>of their order, are, O king, equal to the very gods. Those, however,<br>amongst them that are not well-born and not devoted to the duties of<br>their order, and are, besides wedded to evil practices, are like Sudras.<br>A virtuous king should realise tribute from and impress without pay into<br>the public service those Brahmanas that are not possessed of Vedic lore<br>and that have not their own fires to worship. They that are employed in<br>courts of justice for summoning people, they that perform worship for<br>others for a fee, they that perform the sacrifices of Vaisyas and Sudras,<br>they that officiate in sacrifices on behalf of a whole village, and they<br>that make voyages on the ocean,&#8212;these five are regarded as Chandalas<br>among Brahmanas.[232] They amongst them that become Ritwikas, Purohitas,<br>counsellors, envoys, and messengers, become, O king, equal to<br>Kshatriyas.[233] They amongst them that ride horses or elephants or cars<br>or become foot-soldiers, become, O king, equal to Vaisyas. If the king's<br>treasury is not full, he may realise tribute from these. In realising<br>tribute, the king, however, should exclude those Brahmanas that are (for<br>their conduct) equal to the gods or Brahma. The Vedas say that the king<br>is the lord of the wealth belonging to all the orders except Brahmanas.<br>He can take the wealth of those Brahmanas also that have fallen away from<br>their legitimate duties. The king should never be indifferent towards<br>those Brahmanas that are not observant of their duties. For the sake of<br>making his people virtuous, he should punish and separate them from their<br>superiors. That king, O monarch, in whose territories a Brahmana becomes<br>a thief, is regarded by the learned to be the author of that misdeed.<br>Persons conversant with the Vedas declare that if a Brahmana versed in<br>the Vedas and observant of vows becomes, through want of sustenance, a<br>thief, it is the duty of the king to provide for his support. If, after<br>provision has been made for his support, he does not abstain from theft<br>he should then, O scorcher of foes be banished from the kingdom with all<br>his kinsmen.'"'
