                            "Yudhishthira said, 'How, O grandsire, should a king like us behave in<br>this world, keeping in view the great object of acquisition? What<br>attributes, again, should he always possess so that he may be freed from<br>attachments?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall in this connection recite to thee the old<br>narrative that was uttered by Arishtanemi unto Sagara who had sought his<br>counsel.'<br><br>"Sagara said, 'What is that good, O Brahmana, by doing which one may<br>enjoy felicity here? How, indeed, may one avoid grief and agitation? I<br>wish to know all this!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by Sagara, Arishtanemi of Tarkshya's<br>race, conversant with all the scriptures, regarding the questioner to be<br>every way deserving of his instructions, said these words,[1480] 'The<br>felicity of Emancipation is true felicity in the world. The man of<br>ignorance knows it not, attached as he is to children and animals and<br>possessed of wealth and corn. An understanding that is attached to<br>worldly objects and a mind suffering from thirst,&#8212;these two baffle all<br>skilful treatment. The ignorant man who is bound in the chains of<br>affection is incapable of acquiring Emancipation.[1481] I shall presently<br>speak to thee of all the bonds that spring from the affections. Hear them<br>with attention. Indeed, they are capable of being heard with profit by<br>one that is possessed of knowledge. Having procreated children in due<br>time and married them when they become young men, and having ascertained<br>them to be competent for earning their livelihood, do thou free thyself<br>from all attachments and rove about in happiness. When thou seest thy<br>dearly-cherished wife grown old in years and attached to the son she has<br>brought forth, do thou leave her in time, keeping in view the highest<br>object of acquisition (viz., Emancipation). Whether thou obtainest a son<br>or not, having during the first years of thy life duly enjoyed with thy<br>senses the objects that are addressed to them, free thyself from<br>attachments and rove about in happiness. Having indulged the senses with<br>their objects, thou shouldst suppress the desire of further indulging<br>them. Freeing thyself then from attachments, thou shouldst rove in<br>felicity, contenting thyself with what is obtained without effort and<br>previous calculation, and casting an equal eye upon all creatures and<br>objects.[1482] Thus, O son, have I told thee in brief (of what the way is<br>for freeing thyself from attachments). Hear me now, for I shall presently<br>tell thee, in detail, the desirability of the acquisition of<br>Emancipation.[1483] Those persons who live in this world freed from<br>attachments and fear, succeed in obtaining happiness. Those persons,<br>however, who are attached to worldly objects, without doubt, meet with<br>destruction. Worms and ants (like men) are engaged in the acquisition of<br>food and are seen to die in the search. They that are freed from<br>attachments are happy, while they that are attached to worldly objects<br>meet with destruction. If thou desirest to attain to Emancipation thou<br>shouldst never bestow thy thoughts on thy relatives, thinking,&#8212;How shall<br>these exist without me?&#8212;A living creature takes birth by himself, and<br>grows by himself, and obtains happiness and misery, and death by himself.<br>In this world people enjoy and obtain food and raiment and other<br>acquisitions earned by their parents or themselves. This is the result of<br>the acts of past lives, for nothing can be had in this life which is not<br>the result of the past. All creatures live on the Earth, protected by<br>their own acts, and obtaining their food as the result of what is<br>ordained by Him who assigns the fruits of acts. A man is but a lump of<br>clay, and is always himself completely dependent on other forces. One,<br>therefore, being oneself so, in firm, what rational consideration can one<br>have for protecting and feeding one's relatives? When thy relatives are<br>carried away by Death in thy very sight and in spite of even thy utmost<br>efforts to save them, that circumstance alone should awaken thee. In the<br>every lifetime of thy relatives and before thy own duty is completed of<br>feeding and protecting them, thyself mayst meet with death and abandon<br>them. After thy relatives have been carried away from this world by<br>death, thou canst not know what becomes of them there,&#8212;that is, whether<br>they meet with happiness or misery. This circumstance ought to awaken<br>thee. When in consequence of the fruits of their own acts thy relatives<br>succeed in maintaining themselves in this world whether thou livest or<br>diest, reflecting on this thou shouldst do what is for thy own<br>good.[1484] When this is known to be the case, who in the world is to be<br>regarded as whose? Do thou, therefore, set thy heart on the attainment of<br>Emancipation. Listen now to what more I shall say unto thee. That man of<br>firm Soul is certainly emancipated who has conquered hunger and thirst<br>and such other states of the body, as also wrath and cupidity and error.<br>That man is always emancipated who does not forget himself, through<br>folly, by indulging in gambling and drinking and concubinage and the<br>chase. That man who is really touched by sorrow in consequence of the<br>necessity there is of eating every day and every night for supporting<br>life, is said to be cognisant of the faults of life. One who, as the<br>result of careful reflection, regards his repeated births to be only due<br>to sexual congress with women, is held to be freed from attachments. That<br>man is certainly emancipated who knows truly the nature of the birth, the<br>destruction, and the exertion (or acts) of living creatures. That man<br>becomes certainly freed who regards (as worthy of his acceptance) only a<br>handful of corn, for the support of life, from amidst millions upon<br>millions of carts loaded with grain, and who disregards the difference<br>between a shed of bamboo and reeds and a palatial mansion.[1485] That man<br>becomes certainly freed who beholds the world to be afflicted by death<br>and disease and famine.[1486] Indeed, one who beholds the world to be<br>such succeeds in becoming contented; while one who fails to behold the<br>world in such a light, meets with destruction. That man who is contented<br>with only a little is regarded as freed. That man who beholds the world<br>as consisting of eaters and edibles (and himself as different from both)<br>and who is never touched by pleasure and pain which are born of illusion,<br>is regarded as emancipate. That man who regards a soft bed on a fine<br>bedstead and the hard soil as equal, and who regards good sali rice and<br>hard thick rice as equal, is emancipated. That man who regards linen and<br>cloth made of grass as equal, and in whose estimation cloth of silk and<br>barks of trees are the same, and who sees no difference between clean<br>sheep-skin and unclean leather, is emancipated That man who looks upon<br>this world as the result of the combination of the five primal essences,<br>and who behaves himself in this world, keeping this notion foremost, is<br>emancipated. That man who regards pleasure and pain as equal, and gain<br>and loss as on a par, in whose estimation victory and defeat differ not,<br>to whom like and dislike are the same, and who is unchanged under fear<br>and anxiety, is wholly emancipated. That man who regards his body which<br>has so many imperfections to be only a mass of blood, urine and excreta,<br>as also of disorders and diseases, is emancipated. That man becomes<br>emancipated who always recollects that this body, when overtaken by<br>decrepitude, becomes assailed by wrinkles and white hairs and leanness<br>and paleness of complexion and a bending of the form. That man who<br>recollects his body to be liable to loss of virility, and weakness of<br>sight, and deafness, and loss of strength, is emancipated. That man who<br>knows that the very Rishis, the deities, and the Asuras are beings that<br>have to depart from their respective spheres to other regions, is<br>emancipated. That man who knows that thousands of kings possessed of even<br>great offence and power have departed from this earth, succeeds in<br>becoming emancipated. That man who knows that in this world the<br>acquisition of objects is always difficult, that pain is abundant, and<br>that the maintenance of relatives is ever attended with pain, becomes<br>emancipated.[1487] Beholding the abundant faults of children and of other<br>men, who is there that would not adore Emancipation? That man who,<br>awakened by the scriptures and the experience of the world, beholds every<br>human concern in this world to be unsubstantial, becomes emancipated.<br>Bearing in mind those words of mine, do thou conduct thyself like one<br>that has become emancipated, whether it is a life of domesticity that<br>thou wouldst lead or pursue emancipation without suffering thy<br>understanding to be confounded.'[1488] Hearing these words of his with<br>attention, Sagara, that lord of earth, acquired those virtues which are<br>productive of Emancipation and continued, with their aid to rule his<br>subjects.'"
