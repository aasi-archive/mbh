                            'Yajnavalkya said, Listen now to me, with attention, O king, as to what<br>the places are to which those who die have to go. If the Jiva-soul<br>escapes through the feet, it is said that the man goes to the region of<br>the Vishnu. If through the calves, it has been heard by us, that the man<br>repairs to the regions of the Vasus. if through the knees, he attains to<br>the companionship of those deities that are called Sadhyas. If through<br>the lower duct, the man attains to the regions of Mitra. If through the<br>posteriors, the man returns to the Earth, and if through the thighs to<br>the region of Prajapati. If through the flanks, the man attains to the<br>regions of the Maruts, and if through the nostrils, to the region of<br>Chandramas. If through arms, the man goes to the region of Indra, and if<br>through the chest, to that of Rudra. If through the neck, the man repairs<br>to the excellent region of that foremost of ascetics known by the name of<br>Nara. If through the mouth, the man attains to the region of the<br>Viswadevas and if through the ears, to the region of the deities of the<br>several points of the horizon. If through the nose, the man attains to<br>the region of the Windgod; and if through the eyes, to the region of<br>Agni. If through the brows, the man goes to the region of the Aswins; and<br>if through the forehead, to that of Pitris. If through the crown of the<br>head, the man attains to the region of the puissant Brahman, that<br>foremost of the gods. I have thus told thee, O ruler of Mithila, the<br>several places to which men repair according to the manner in which their<br>Jiva-souls escape from their bodies. I shall now tell thee the<br>premonitory indication, as laid down by the wise of those who have but<br>one year to live. One, who having previously seen the fixed star called<br>Arandhati, fails to see it, or that other star called Dhruva,[1660] or<br>one that sees the full Moon or the flame of a burning lamp to be broken<br>towards the south, has but one year to live. Those men, O king, who can<br>no longer see images of themselves reflected in the eyes of others, have<br>but one year to live. One, who, being endued with lustre loses it, or<br>being endued with wisdom loses it,&#8212;indeed, one whose inward and outward<br>nature is thus changed,&#8212;has but six months more to live. He, who<br>disregards the deities, or quarrels with the Brahmanas, or one, who,<br>being naturally of a dark complexion becomes pale of hue, has but six<br>months more to live. One, who sees the lunar disc to have many holes like<br>a spider's web, or one, who sees the solar disc to have similar holes has<br>but one week more to live. One, who, when smelling fragrant scents in<br>place of worship, perceives them to be as offensive as the scent of<br>corpses, has but one week more to live. The depression of the nose or of<br>the ears, the discolour of the teeth or of the eye, the loss of all<br>consciousness, and the loss also of all animal heat, are symptoms<br>indicating death that very day. If, without any perceptible cause a<br>stream of tears suddenly flows from one's left eye, and if vapours be<br>seen to issue from one's head, that is a sure indication that the man<br>will die before that day expires. Knowing all these premonitory symptoms,<br>the man of cleansed soul should day and night unite his soul with the<br>Supreme Soul (in Samadhi). Thus should he go on till the day-comes for<br>his dissolution. If, however, instead of wishing to die he desires to<br>live in this world, he casts off all enjoyments,&#8212;all scents and<br>tastes,&#8212;O king, and lives on in abstinence. He thus conquers death by<br>fixing his soul on the Supreme Soul. Indeed, the man, who is blessed with<br>knowledge of the Soul, O monarch, practises the course of life<br>recommended by the Sankhyas and conquers death by uniting his soul with<br>the Supreme Soul. At last, he attains to what is entirely indestructible,<br>which is without birth, which is auspicious, and immutable, and eternal,<br>and stable, and which is incapable of being attained to by men of<br>uncleansed souls.'"
