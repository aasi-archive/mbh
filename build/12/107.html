                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast, O scorcher of foes, described the course<br>of duties, the general conduct, the means of livelihood, with their<br>results, of Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras. Thou hast<br>discoursed also on the duties of kings, the subject of their treasuries,<br>the means of filling them, and the topic of conquest and victory. Thou<br>hast spoken also of the characteristics of ministers, the measures, that<br>lead to the advancement of the subjects, the characteristics of the<br>sixfold limbs of a kingdom, the qualities of armies, the means of<br>distinguishing the wicked, and the marks of those that are good, the<br>attributes of those that are equal, those that are inferior, and those<br>that are superior, the behaviour which a king desirous of advancement<br>should adopt towards the masses, and the manner in which the weak should<br>be protected and cherished. Thou hast discoursed on all these subjects, O<br>Bharata, laying down instructions that are plain according to what has<br>been inculcated hi sacred treatise. Thou hast spoken also of the<br>behaviour that should be adopted by kings desirous of conquering their<br>foes. I desire now, O foremost of intelligent men, to listen to the<br>behaviour that one should observe towards the multitude of courageous men<br>that assemble round a king![327] I desire to hear how these may grow, how<br>they may be attached to the king, O Bharata, how may they succeed in<br>subjugating their foes and in acquiring friends. It seems to me that<br>disunion alone can bring about their destruction. I think it is always<br>difficult to keep counsels secret when many are concerned. I desire to<br>hear all this in detail, O scorcher of foes! Tell me also, O king, the<br>means by which they may be prevented from falling out with the king.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Between the aristocracy on the one side and the kings on<br>the other, avarice and wrath, O monarch, are the causes that produce<br>enmity.[328] One of these parties (viz., the king,) yields to avarice. As<br>a consequence, wrath takes possession of the other (the aristocracy).<br>Each intent upon weakening and wasting the other, they both meet with<br>destruction. By employing spies, contrivances of policy, and physical<br>force, and adopting the arts of conciliation, gifts, and disunion and<br>applying other methods for producing weakness, waste, and fear, the<br>parties assail each other. The aristocracy of a kingdom, having the<br>characteristics of a compact body, become dissociated from the king if<br>the latter seeks to take too much from them. Dissociated from the king,<br>all of them become dissatisfied, and acting from fear, side with the<br>enemies of their ruler. If again the aristocracy of a kingdom be<br>disunited amongst themselves, they meet with destruction. Disunited, they<br>fall an easy prey to foes. The nobles, therefore, should always act in<br>concert. If they be united together, they may earn acquisitions of value<br>by means of their strength and prowess. Indeed, when they are thus<br>united, many outsiders seek their alliance. Men of knowledge applaud<br>those nobles that art united with one another in bonds of love. If united<br>in purpose, all of them can be happy. They can (by their example)<br>establish righteous courses of conduct. By behaving properly, they<br>advance in prosperity. By restraining their sons and brothers and<br>teaching them their duties, and by behaving kindly towards all persons<br>whose pride has been quelled by knowledge,[329] the aristocracy advance<br>in prosperity. By always attending to the duties of setting spies and<br>devising means of policy, as also to the matter of filling their<br>treasuries, the aristocracy, O thou of mighty arms, advance in<br>prosperity. By showing proper reverence for them that are possessed of<br>wisdom and courage and perseverance and that display steady prowess in<br>all kinds of work, the aristocracy advance in prosperity. Possessed of<br>wealth and resources, of knowledge of the scriptures and all arts and<br>sciences, the aristocracy rescue the ignorant masses from every kind of<br>distress and danger. Wrath (on the of part the king), rupture,[330]<br>terror, chastisement, persecution, oppression, and executions, O chief of<br>the Bharatas, speedily cause the aristocracy to fall away from the king<br>and side with the king's enemies. They, therefore, that are the leaders<br>of the aristocracy should be honoured by the king. The affairs of the<br>kingdom, O king, depend to a great extent upon them. Consultations should<br>be held with only those that are the leaders of the aristocracy, and<br>secret agents should be placed, O crusher of foes, with them only. The<br>king should not, O Bharata, consult with every member of the aristocracy.<br>The king, acting in concert with the leaders, should do what is for the<br>good of the whole order. When, however, the aristocracy becomes separated<br>and disunited and destitute of leaders, other courses of action should be<br>followed. If the members of the aristocracy quarrel with one another and<br>act, each according to his own resources, without combination, their<br>prosperity dwindles away and diverse kinds of evil occur. Those amongst<br>them that are possessed of learning and wisdom should tread down a<br>dispute as soon as it happens. Indeed, if the seniors of a race look on<br>with indifference, quarrels break out amongst the members. Such quarrels<br>bring about the destruction of a race and produce disunion among the<br>(entire order of the) nobles. Protect thyself, O king, from all fears<br>that arise from within. Fears, however, that arise from outside are of<br>little consequence. The first kind of fear, O king, may cut thy roots in<br>a single day. Persons that are equal to one another in family and blood,<br>influenced by wrath or folly or covetousness arising from their very<br>natures, cease to speak with one another. This is an indication of<br>defeat. It is not by courage, nor by intelligence, nor by beauty, nor by<br>wealth, that enemies succeed in destroying the aristocracy. It is only by<br>disunion and gifts that it can be reduced to subjugation. For this<br>reason, combination has been said to be the great refuge of the<br>aristocracy.'"[331]
