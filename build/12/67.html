                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast said what the duties are of the four modes<br>of the life and the four orders. Tell me now, O grandsire, what are the<br>principal duties of a kingdom.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The (election and) coronation of a king is the first duty<br>of a kingdom. A kingdom in which anarchy prevails becomes weak and is<br>soon afflicted by robbers.[212] In kingdoms torn by anarchy,<br>righteousness cannot dwell. The inhabitants devour one another. An<br>anarchy is the worst possible of states. The Srutis declare that in<br>crowning a king, it is Indra that is crowned (in the person of the king).<br>A person who is desirous of prosperity should worship the king as he<br>should worship Indra himself. No one should dwell in kingdoms torn by<br>anarchy. Agni does not convey (to the gods) the libations that are poured<br>upon him in kingdoms where anarchy prevails. If a powerful king<br>approaches kingdoms weakened by anarchy, from desire of annexing them to<br>his dominions, the people should go forward and receive the invader with<br>respect. Some conduct would be consistent with wise counsels. There is no<br>evil greater than anarchy. If the powerful invader be inclined to equity,<br>everything will be right. If, on the other hand, he be engaged, he may<br>exterminate all. That cow which cannot be easily milked has to suffer<br>much torture. On the other hand, that cow which is capable of being<br>easily milked, has not to suffer any torture whatever. The wood that<br>bends easily does not require to be heated. The tree that bends easily,<br>has not to suffer any torture (at the hands of the gardener). Guided by<br>these instances, O hero, men should bend before those that are powerful.<br>The man that bends his head to a powerful person really bends his head to<br>Indra. For these reasons, men desirous of prosperity should (elect and)<br>crown some person as their king. They who live in countries where anarchy<br>prevails cannot enjoy their wealth and wives. During times of anarchy,<br>the sinful man derive great pleasure by robbing the wealth of other<br>people. When, however, his (ill-got) wealth is snatched by others, he<br>wishes for a king. It is evident, therefore, that in times of anarchy the<br>very wicked even cannot be happy. The wealth of one is snatched away by<br>two. That of those two is snatched away by many acting together. He who<br>is not a slave is made a slave. Women, again, are forcibly abducted. For<br>these reasons the gods created kings for protecting the people. If there<br>were no king on earth for wielding the rod of chastisement, the strong<br>would then have preyed on the weak after the manner of fishes in the<br>water. In hath been heard by us that men, in days of old, in consequence<br>of anarchy, met with destruction, devouring one another like stronger<br>fishes devouring the weaker ones in the water. It hath been heard by us<br>that a few amongst them then, assembling together, made certain compacts,<br>saying, 'He who becomes harsh in speech, or violent in temper, he who<br>seduces or abducts other people's wives or robs the wealth that belongs<br>to others, should be cast off by us.' For inspiring confidence among all<br>classes of the people, they made such a compact and lived for some time.<br>Assembling after some time they proceeded in affliction to the Grandsire,<br>saying, 'Without a king, O divine lord, we are going to destruction.<br>Appoint some one as our king. All of us shall worship him and he shall<br>protect us.' Thus solicited, the Grandsire asked Manu. Manu, however, did<br>not assent to the proposal.<br><br>"Manu said, 'I fear all sinful acts. To govern a kingdom is exceedingly<br>difficult, especially among men who are always false and deceitful in<br>their behaviour.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The inhabitants of the earth then said unto him, 'Do<br>not fear. The sins that men commit will touch those only that commit them<br>(without staining thee in the least). For the increase of thy treasury,<br>we will give thee a fiftieth part of our animals and precious metals and<br>a tenth part of our grain. When our maidens also will become desirous of<br>wedding, we shall, when the question comes up, give thee the most<br>beautiful ones among them. Those amongst men who will become the foremost<br>of all in the use of weapons and in riding animals and driving vehicles,<br>shall proceed behind thee like the deities behind Indra. With thy<br>strength enhanced in this way, and becoming invincible and possessed of<br>great prowess, thou wilt be our king and protect us happily like Kuvera<br>protecting the Yakshas and the Rakshasas. A fourth part of the merit<br>which men will earn under thy protection will be thine. Strengthened by<br>that merit so easily obtained by thee, do thou protect us, O king, like<br>He of a hundred sacrifices protecting the deities. Like the Sun scorching<br>everything with his rays, go out for winning victories. Crush the pride<br>of foes and let righteousness always triumph (in the world).' Thus<br>addressed by those inhabitants of the earth, Manu, possessed of great<br>energy, proceeded, accompanied by a large force. Of high descent, he<br>seemed then to blaze with prowess. Beholding the might of Manu, like the<br>gods eyeing the might of Indra, the inhabitants of the earth became<br>inspired with fear and set their hearts upon their respective duties.<br>Manu then made his round through the world, checking everywhere all acts<br>of wickedness and setting all men to their respective duties, like a<br>rain-charged cloud (in its mission of beneficence).'<br><br>"Those, O Yudhishthira, those men on earth who desire prosperity should<br>first elect and crown a king for the protection of all. Like disciples<br>humbling themselves in the presence of the preceptors or the gods in the<br>presence of Indra, all men should humble themselves before the king. One<br>that is honoured by his own people becomes an object of regard with his<br>foes also, while one that is disregarded by his own is overridden by<br>foes. If the king be overridden by his foes, all his subjects become<br>unhappy. Therefore, umbrellas and vehicles and outward ornaments, and<br>viands, and drinks, and mansions, and seats, and beds, and all utensils<br>for use and show, should be assigned to the king. By such means the king<br>will succeed in discharging his duties of protection (the better) and<br>become irresistible. He should speak with smiles. Addressed sweetly by<br>others, he should address others sweetly. Grateful (to those that serve<br>him), firmly devoted (to those that deserve his respect), and with<br>passions under control, he should give unto others their due. Looked upon<br>by others he should look at them mildly, sweetly, and handsomely.'
