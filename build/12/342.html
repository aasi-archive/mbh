                            Janamejaya said, "O holy one, it behoveth thee to tell me the<br>significance of those diverse names uttering which the great Rishi Vyasa<br>with his disciples hymned the praises of the illustrious slayer of Madhu.<br>I am desirous of hearing those names of Hari, that Supreme Lord of all<br>creatures. Indeed, by listening to those names, I shall be sanctified and<br>cleansed even like the bright autumnal moon.<br><br>Vaisampayana said, Listen, O king, to what the significances are of the<br>diverse names, due to attributes and acts, of Hari as the puissant Hari<br>himself of cheerful soul explained them to Phalguna. That slayer of<br>hostile heroes, viz., Phalguna, had at one time asked Kesava, enquiring<br>after the imports of the some of the names by which the high-souled<br>Keshva is adored.<br><br>"Arjuna said, "O holy one, O Supreme ordainer of the Past and the Future.<br>O Creator of all Beings, O immutable one, O Refuge of all the worlds, O<br>Lord of the universe, O dispeller of the fears of all persons, I desire<br>to hear from thee in detail, O Kesava, the significance of all those<br>names of thine, O God, which have been mentioned by the great Rishis in<br>the Vedas and the Puranas in consequences of diverse acts of thine. None<br>else than thee, O Lord, is competent to explain the significations of<br>those names.'"<br><br>"The holy one said, 'In the Rigveda, in the Yajurveda, in the Atharvans<br>and the Samans, in the Puranas and the Upanishads, as also in the<br>treatises on Astrology, O Arjuna, in the Sankhya scriptures, in the Yoga<br>scriptures, and in the treatises also on the Science of Life, many are<br>the names that have been mentioned by the great Rishis. Some of those<br>names are derivable from my attributes and some of them relate to my<br>acts. Do thou hear, with concentrated attention, O sinless one, what the<br>import is of each off those names (in particular) that have reference to<br>my acts. I shall recite them to you. It is said that in days of yore you<br>were half my body. Salutations unto Him of great glory, Him, viz., that<br>is the Supreme Soul of all embodied creatures.[1850] Salutations unto<br>Narayana, unto Him that is identifiable with the universe, unto Him that<br>transcends the three (primal) attributes (of Sattwa, Rajas and Minas),<br>unto Him that is, again, the Soul of those attributes. From His grace<br>'lath arisen Brahman and from His wrath hath arisen Rudra. He is the<br>source whence have sprung all mobile and immobile creatures. O foremost<br>of all persons endued with Sattwa, the attribute of Sattwa consists of<br>the eight and ten qualities.[1851] That attribute is Supreme Nature<br>having for her soul the Sky and Earth and succeeding by her creative<br>forces in upholding the universe. That Nature is identical with the fruit<br>of all acts (in the form of the diverse regions of felicity to which<br>creatures attain through their acts). She is also the pure Chit. She is<br>immortal, and invincible, and is called the Soul of the universe. From<br>her flows all the modifications of both Creation and Destruction. (She is<br>identical with my Prakriti or Nature). Divested of sex, She or He is the<br>penances that people undergo. He is both the sacrifice that is performed<br>and the sacrificer that performs the sacrifice. He is the ancient and the<br>infinite Purusha. He is otherwise called Aniruddha and is the source of<br>the Creation and the Destruction of the universe. When Brahma's night<br>wore off, through the grace of that Being of immeasurable energy, a lotus<br>made its appearance first, O thou of eyes like lotus petals. Within that<br>lotus was born Brahma, springing from Aniruddha's grace. Towards the<br>evening of Brahma's day, Aniruddha became filled with wrath, and as a<br>consequence of this, there sprang from his forehead a son called Rudra<br>vested with the power of destroying everything (when the hour for<br>destruction comes). These two, viz., Brahma and Rudra, are the foremost<br>of all the deities, having sprung respectively from the Propitiousness<br>and the Wrath (of Aniruddha). Acting according to Aniruddha's direction,<br>these two deities create and destroy. Although capable of granting boons<br>unto all creatures, they are, however, in the matter of the concerns to<br>which they attend (viz., Creation and Destruction), merely instruments in<br>the hands of Aniruddha. (It is Aniruddha that does everything, making<br>Brahma and Rudra the visible agents in respect of the universe). Rudra is<br>otherwise called Kaparddin. He has matted locks on his head, and<br>sometimes displays a head that is bald. He loves to dwell in the midst of<br>crematoriums which constitute his home. He is an observer of the<br>austerest vows. He is Yogin of mighty puissance and energy. He is the<br>destroyer of Daksha's sacrifice and the tearer of Bhaga's eyes. O son of<br>Pandu, Rudra should be known to have always Narayana for his Soul. If<br>that deity of deities, viz., Maheswara, be worshipped, then O Partha, is<br>the puissant Narayana also worshipped. I am the Soul, O son of Pandu, of<br>all the worlds, of all the universe. Rudra, again, is my Soul. It is for<br>this that I always adore him. If I do not adore the auspicious and<br>boon-giving Isana nobody would then adore my own self. The ordinances I<br>set are followed by all the worlds. Those ordinances should always be<br>adored, and it is, therefore, that I adore them. He who knows Rudra knows<br>myself, and he who knows myself knows Rudra. He who follows Rudra follows<br>me, Rudra is Narayana. Both are one; and one is displayed in two<br>different forms. Rudra and Narayana, forming one person, pervade all<br>displayed things and cause them to act. No one else than Rudra is<br>competent to grant me a boon. O son of Pandu. Having settled this in my<br>mind, I adored in days of yore the ancient and puissant Rudra, for<br>obtaining the boon of a son. In adoring Rudra thus I adored my own self.<br>Vishnu never bows his head unto any deity except his own self. It is for<br>this reason that I adore Rudra, (Rudra being, as I have already told<br>thee, my own self). All the deities, including Brahma and Indra and the<br>deities and the great Rishis, adore Narayana, that foremost of deities,<br>otherwise called by the name of Hari. Vishnu is the foremost of all<br>Beings past, present, or future, and as such should always be adored and<br>worshipped with reverence. Do thou bow thy head unto Vishnu. Do thou bow<br>thy head unto Him who gives protection to all. Do thou bow, O son of<br>Kunti, unto that great boon-giving deity, that foremost of deities, who<br>eats the offerings made unto him in sacrifices. I have heard that there<br>are four kinds of worshippers, viz., those who are eager for a religious<br>life, those who are enquirers, those who strive to comprehend what they<br>learn and those who are wise. Among them all, they that are devoted to<br>realising the self and do not adore any other deity, are the foremost. I<br>am the end they seek, and though engaged in acts, they never seek the<br>fruits thereof. The three remaining classes of my worshippers are those<br>that are desirous of the fruits of their acts. They attain to regions of<br>great felicity, but then they have to fall down therefrom upon the<br>exhaustion of their merits. Those amongst my worshippers, therefore, that<br>are fully awakened (and, as such, that know that all happiness is<br>terminable except what is attainable by persons that become identified<br>with me) obtain what is foremost (and invaluable).[1852] Those that are<br>awakened and whose conduct displays such enlightenment, may be engaged in<br>adoring Brahman or Mahadeva or the other deities that occur in heaven but<br>they succeed at least in attaining to myself. I have thus told thee, O<br>Partha, what the distinctions are between my worshippers. Thyself, O son<br>of Kunti, and myself are known as Nara and Narayana. Both of us have<br>assumed human bodies only for the purpose of lightening the burden of the<br>Earth. I am fully cognisant of self-knowledge. I know who I am and whence<br>I am, O Bharata. I know the religion of Nivritti, and all that<br>contributes to the prosperity of creatures. Eternal as I am, I am the one<br>sole Refuge of all men. The waters have been called by the name of Nara,<br>for they sprang from Him called Nara. And since the waters in former<br>times, were my refuge, I am, therefore, called by the name of Narayana.<br>Assuming the form of the Sun I cover the universe with my rays. And<br>because I am the home of all creatures, therefore, am I called by the<br>name of Vasudeva. I am the end of all creatures and their sire, O<br>Bharata. I pervade the entire firmament on high and the Earth, O Partha,<br>and my splendour transcends every other splendour. I am He, O Bharata,<br>whom all creatures wish to attain to at the time of death. And because I<br>pervade all the universe, I have come to be called by the name of Vishnu.<br>Desirous of attaining to success through restraint of their senses,<br>people seek to attain to me who am heaven and Earth and the firmament<br>between the two. For this am I called by the name of Damodara. The word<br>Prisni includes food, the Vedas, water, and nectar. These four are always<br>in my stomach. Hence am I called by the name of Prisnigarbha. The Rishis<br>have said that once on a time when the Rishi Trita was thrown into a well<br>by Ekata and Dwiti, the distressed Trita invoked me, saying,&#8212;O<br>Prisnigarbha, do thou rescue the fallen Trita! That foremost of Rishis,<br>viz., Trita, the spiritual son of Brahma, having called on me thus, was<br>rescued from the pit. The rays that emanate from the Sun who gives heat<br>to the world, from the blazing fire, and from the Moon, constitute my<br>hair. Hence do foremost of learned Brahmanas call me by the name of<br>Kesava. The high-souled Utathya having impregnated his wife disappeared<br>from her side through an illusion of the gods. The younger brother<br>Vrihaspati then appeared before that high-souled one's wife. Unto that<br>foremost of Rishis that had repaired thither from desire of congress, the<br>child in the womb of Utathya's wife, O son of Kunti, whose body had<br>already been formed of the five primal elements, said,&#8212;O giver of boons,<br>I have already entered into this womb. It behoveth thee not to assail my<br>mother. Hearing these words of the unborn child, Vrihaspati, became<br>filled with wrath and denounced a curse on him, saying,&#8212;Since thou<br>obstructest me in this way when I have come hither from desire of the<br>pleasures of congress, therefore shalt thou, by my curse, be visited by<br>blindness, without doubt! Through this curse of that foremost of Rishis.<br>the child of Utathya was born blind, and blind he remained for a long<br>time. It was for this reason that, that the Rishi, in days of yore, came<br>to be known by the name of Dirghatamas. He, however, acquired the four<br>Vedas with their eternal limbs and subsidiary parts. After that he<br>frequently invoked me by this secret name of mine. Indeed, according to<br>the ordinance as laid down, he repeatedly called upon me by the name of<br>Kesava. Through the merit he acquired by uttering this name repeatedly,<br>he became cured of his blindness and then came to be called by the name<br>of Gotama. This name of mine, therefore, O Arjuna is productive of boons<br>unto them that utter it among all the deities and the high-souled Rishis.<br>The deity of Fire (Appetite) and Shoma (food) combining together, become<br>transfused into one and the same substance. It is for this reason that<br>the entire universe of mobile and immobile creatures is said to be<br>pervaded by those two deities.[1853] In the Puranas, Agni and Soma are<br>spoken of as complementary to one another. The deities also are said to<br>have Agni for their mouth. It is in consequence of these two beings<br>endued with natures leading to the unification that they are said to be<br>deserving of each other and upholders of the universe.'"
