                            "Yudhishthira said, 'It behoveth thee, O grandsire, to discourse to me on<br>that which is freed from duty and its reverse, which is freed from every<br>doubt, which transcends birth and death, as also virtue and sin, which is<br>auspiciousness, which is eternal fearlessness, which is Eternal and<br>Indestructible, and Immutable, which is always Pure, and which is ever<br>free from the toil of exertion.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall in this connection recite to thee the old<br>narrative, O Bharata, of the discourse between Yajnavalkya and Janaka.<br>Once on a time the famous king Daivarati of Janaka's race, fully<br>conversant with the import of all questions, addressed this question to<br>Yajnavalkya, that foremost of Rishis.<br><br>"'Janaka said, 'O regenerate Rishi, how many kinds of senses are there?<br>How many kinds also are there of Prakriti? What is the Unmanifest and<br>highest Brahma? What is higher than Brahma? What is birth and what is<br>death? What are the limits of Age? It behoveth thee, O foremost of<br>Brahmanas, to discourse on all these topics unto me that am solicitous of<br>obtaining thy grace; I am ignorant while thou art an Ocean of knowledge.<br>Hence, I ask thee! Verily, I desire to hear thee discourse on all these<br>subjects!<br><br>"'Yajnavalkya said, Hear, O monarch, what I say in an answer to these<br>questions of thine, I shall impart to thee the high knowledge which<br>Yogins value, and especially that which is possessed by the Sankhyas.<br>Nothing is unknown to thee. Still thou askest me. One however, that is<br>questioned should answer. This is the eternal practice. Eight principles<br>have been called by the name of Prakriti, while sixteen have been called<br>modifications. Of Manifest, there are seven. These are the views of those<br>persons who are conversant with the science of Adhyatma. The Unmanifest<br>(or original Prakriti), Mahat, Consciousness, and the five subtile<br>elements of Earth, Wind, Space, Water, and Light,&#8212;these eight are known<br>by the name of Prakriti. Listen now to the enumeration of those called<br>modifications. They are the ear, the skin, the tongue, and the nose; and<br>sound, touch, form, taste, and scent, as also speech, the two arms, the<br>two feet, the lower duct (within the body), and the organs of<br>pleasure.[1641] Amongst these, the ten beginning with sound, and having<br>their origin in the five great principles,[1642] are called Visesha. The<br>five senses of knowledge are called Savisesha, O ruler of Mithila.<br>Persons conversant with the Science of Adhyatma regard the mind as the<br>sixteenth. This is conformable to thy own views as also to those of other<br>learned men well acquainted with the truths about principles. From the<br>Unmanifest, O king, springs the Mahat-soul. The learned say this to be<br>the first creation relating to Pradhana (or Prakriti): From Mahat, O king<br>of men, is produced Consciousness. This has been called the second<br>creation having the Understanding for its essence.[1643] From<br>Consciousness hath sprung the Mind which is the essence of sound and the<br>others that are the attributes of space and the rest. This is the third<br>creation, said to relate to Consciousness. From mind have sprung the<br>great elements, (numbering five), O king! Know that this is the fourth<br>creation called mental, as I say. Persons conversant with the primal<br>elements say that Sound and Touch and Form and Taste and Scent are the<br>fifth creation, relating to the Great (primal) elements. The creation of<br>the Ear, the Skin, the Tongue, and the Scent, forms the sixth and is<br>regarded as having for its essence multiplicity of thought. The senses<br>that come after the Ear and the others (i.e., the senses of action) then<br>arise, O monarch. This is called seventh creation and relates to the<br>senses of Knowledge. Then, O monarch, come the breath that rises upward<br>(viz., Prana) and those that have a transverse motion (viz., Saman,<br>Udana, and Vyana). This is the eighth creation and is called<br>Arjjava.[1644] Then come those breaths that course transversely in the<br>lower parts of the body (viz., Samana, Udana and Vyana) and also that<br>called Apana coursing downwards. This, ninth creation, is also called<br>Arjjava, O king. These nine kinds of creation, and these principles, O<br>monarch, which latter number four and twenty, are declared to thee<br>according to what has been laid down in the scriptures. After this, O<br>king, listen to me as I tell thee durations of time as indicated by the<br>learned in respect of these principles or attribute.'"
