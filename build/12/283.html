                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, thou art possessed of great wisdom and<br>thoroughly conversant with every branch of learning. From this very<br>narrative of the slaughter of Vritra the wish has arisen in my mind of<br>asking thee a question. Thou hast said, O ruler of men, that Vritra was<br>(first) stupefied by Fever, and that then, O sinless one, he was slain by<br>Vasava with the thunderbolt. How did this Fever, O thou of great wisdom,<br>arise? O lord, I desire to hear in detail of the origin of Fever.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O king, to the origin, celebrated over all the<br>world, of Fever. I shall speak in detail on this topic, fully explaining<br>how Fever first sprang into existence, O Bharata! In days of yore, O<br>monarch, there was a summit, named Savitri, of the mountains of Meru.<br>Worshipped by all the worlds, it was endued with great splendour and<br>adorned with every kind of jewels and gems. That summit was immeasurable<br>in extent and thither no one could go.[1398] On that mountain summit the<br>divine Mahadeva used to sit in splendour as if on a bed-stead adorned<br>with gold. The daughter of the king of mountains, sitting by his side,<br>shone in brilliance.[1399] The high-souled deities, the Vasus of<br>immeasurable energy, the high-souled Aswins, those foremost of<br>physicians, and king Vaisravana waited upon by many a Guhyaka,&#8212;that lord<br>of the Yakshas, endued with prosperity and puissance, and having his<br>abode on the summit of Kailasa,&#8212;all waited upon the highsouled Mahadeva.<br>And the great sage Usanas, and the foremost of Rishis having Sanatkumara<br>for their first, and the other celestial Rishis headed by Angiras, and<br>the Gandharva Viswavasu, and Narada and Parvata, and the diverse tribes<br>of Apsaras, all came there to wait upon the Master of the universe. A<br>pure and auspicious breeze, bearing diverse kinds of perfumes, blew<br>there. The trees that stood there were adorned with the flowers of every<br>season. A large number of Vidyadharas and Siddhas and ascetics too, O<br>Bharata, repaired thither for waiting upon Mahadeva, the Lord of all<br>creatures. Many ghostly beings, also, of diverse forms and aspects, and<br>many dreadful Rakshasas and mighty Pisachas, of diverse aspects, mad with<br>joy, and armed with diverse kinds of uplifted weapons, forming the train<br>of Mahadeva, were there, every one of whom resembled a blazing fire in<br>energy. The illustrious Nandi stood there at the command of the great<br>god, blazing with his own energy and armed with a lance that resembled a<br>flame of fire. Ganga also, that foremost of all Rivers and born of all<br>sacred waters in the universe, waited there in her embodied form, O son<br>of Kuru's race, upon that illustrious deity. Thus adored by the celestial<br>Rishis and the gods, the illustrious Mahadeva of immeasurable energy<br>dwelt on that summit of Meru.<br><br>"After some time had passed away, the Prajapati Daksha[1400] commenced to<br>perform a Sacrifice according to the ancient rites (laid down in the<br>Vedas). Unto the Sacrifice of Daksha, all the deities headed by Sakra,<br>assembling together, resolved to repair. It hath been heard by us that<br>the high-souled deities, with the permission o f Mahadeva, mounted their<br>celestial cars resembling the fire or the Sun in splendour, and proceeded<br>to that spot (on the Himavat) whence the Ganges is said to issue.<br>Beholding the deities depart, the excellent daughter of the king of<br>mountains, addressed her divine spouse, viz., the Lord of all creatures,<br>and said, 'O illustrious one, whither are those deities headed by Sakra<br>going? O thou that art conversant with the truth, tell me truly, for a<br>great doubt has filled my mind.'<br><br>"Maheswara said, 'O lady that art highly blessed, the excellent Prajapati<br>Daksha is adoring the gods in a Horse-sacrifice. These denizens of heaven<br>are proceeding even thither.'<br><br>"Uma said, 'Why, O Mahadeva, dost thou not proceed to that Sacrifice?<br>What objection is there of thy going to that place?'<br><br>"Maheswara said, 'O highly blessed lady, the deities in days of yore made<br>an arrangement in consequence of which no share was assigned to me of<br>offerings in all Sacrifices. Agreeably to the course that was sanctioned<br>in consequence of that arrangement, O thou of the fairest complexion, the<br>deities do not give me, following the old custom, any share of the<br>sacrificial offerings.'<br><br>"Uma said, O illustrious one, among all beings thou art the foremost in<br>puissance. In merit, in energy, in fame, and in prosperity, thou yieldest<br>to none, and thou art, indeed, superior to all. In consequence, however,<br>of this disability in respect of a share (in the Sacrificial offerings) I<br>am filled with great grief, O sinless one, and a tremor overtakes me from<br>head to foot.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The goddess (Parvati), having said these words unto<br>her divine spouse, the Lord of all creatures, O monarch, remained silent,<br>her heart burning the while in grief. Then Mahadeva, understanding what<br>was in her heart and what her thoughts were (for wiping off that<br>disgrace), addressed Nandi, saying, 'Wait here (by the goddess).<br>Summoning all his Yoga force, that Lord of all lords of Yoga, that god of<br>gods, that wielder of Pinaka, possessed of mighty energy, quickly<br>proceeded to the place (where Daksha was sacrificing) accompanied by all<br>his terrible followers and destroyed that Sacrifice. Amongst these<br>followers of his, some uttered loud cries, and some laughed terribly, and<br>some, O king, extinguished the (Sacrificial) fires with blood; and some,<br>possessed of awful faces, pulling up the sacrificial stakes, began to<br>whirl them. Others began to devour those that were ministering to the<br>Sacrifice. Then that sacrifice, thus afflicted on every side, assumed the<br>form of a deer and sought to fly away through the skies. Ascertaining<br>that the Sacrifice was running away in that form, the puissant Mahadeva<br>began to pursue him with bow and arrow. In consequence of the wrath that<br>then filled the heart of that foremost of all gods, possessed of<br>immeasurable energy, a dreadful drop of sweat appeared on his forehead.<br>When that drop of sweat fell down on the earth, there forthwith appeared<br>a blazing fire resembling the (all-destructive) conflagration that<br>appears at the end of a Yuga. From that fire issued a dreadful being, O<br>monarch, of very short stature, possessed of blood-red eyes and a green<br>beard. His body was covered entirely with hair like a hawk's or an owl's<br>and his hair stood erect. Of dreadful aspect, his complexion was dark and<br>his attire blood-red. Like a fire burning a heap of dry grass or straw,<br>that Being of great energy quickly consumed the embodied form of<br>Sacrifice. Having accomplished that feat, he then rushed towards the<br>deities and the Rishis that had assembled there. The deities, filled with<br>fear, fled in all directions. In consequence of that Being's tread, the<br>earth, O monarch began to tremble.[1401] Exclamations of Oh and Alas<br>arose throughout the universe. Marking this, the puissant Grandsire,<br>showing himself unto Mahadeva, addressed him in the following words.'<br><br>"Brahman said, 'O puissant one, the deities will henceforth yield thee a<br>share of the sacrificial offerings! O Lord of all the deities, let this<br>wrath of thine be withdrawn by thee! O scorcher of foes, there, those<br>gods, and the Rishis, in consequence of thy wrath, O Mahadeva, have<br>become exceedingly agitated. This Being also, that hath sprung from thy<br>sweat, O foremost of gods, shall wander among creatures, O<br>righteous-souled one, under the name of Fever. O puissant one, if the<br>energy of this Being remains all collected together, then the entire<br>earth herself will not be able to bear him. Let him, therefore, be<br>distributed into many parts.' When Brahman had said these words, and when<br>his proper share was appointed of the sacrificial offerings, Mahadeva<br>replied unto the Grandsire of great energy, saying, 'So be id' Indeed,<br>the wielder of Pinaka, viz., Bhava, smiled a little and became filled<br>with joy. And he accepted the share that the Grandsire appointed of the<br>offerings in sacrifices. Conversant with the properties of everything,<br>Mahadeva then distributed Fever into many portions, for the peace of all<br>creatures. Listen, O son, as to how he did this. The heat that is<br>perceptible in the heads of elephants, the bitumen of mountains,[1402]<br>the moss that floats on water, the slough of snakes, the sores that<br>appear in the hoofs of bulls, the sterile tracts of earth that are full<br>of saline matter, the dullness of vision of all animals, the diseases<br>that appear in the throats of horses, the crests appearing on the heads<br>of peacocks, the eye-disease of the koel,[1403] each of these was named<br>Fever by the high-souled Mahadeva. This is what has been heard by us. The<br>liver-disease also of sheep, and the hiccup of parrots are also each<br>known as forms of Fever. To this must be added the toil that tigers<br>undergo, for that also, O, righteous king, is known as a from of Fever.<br>Besides these, O Bharata, amongst men, Fever enters all bodies at the<br>time of birth, of death, and on other occasions. This then that is called<br>Fever is known to be the dreadful energy of Maheswara. He is endued with<br>authority over all creatures and should, therefore, be held in respect<br>and worshipped by all. It was by him that Vritra, that foremost of<br>virtuous persons, was overtaken when he yawned. It was then that Sakra<br>hurled his thunderbolt at him. Thunderbolt, penetrating the body of<br>Vritra, O Bharata, divided him in twain. Divided in twain by the<br>thunderbolt, the mighty Asura possessed of great Yoga powers, proceeded<br>to the region of Vishnu of immeasurable energy. It was in consequence of<br>his devotion to Vishnu that he had succeeded in overwhelming the whole<br>universe. And it was in consequence of his devotion to Vishnu that he<br>ascended, when slain, to the region of Vishnu. Thus, O son, adverting: to<br>the story of Vritra have I recited to thee the narrative in detail of<br>Fever. Upon what else shall I speak to thee? That man who will read this<br>account of the origin of Fever with close attention and cheerful heart<br>shall become free from disease and shall always have happiness for his<br>share. Filled with gladness, he shall have all the wishes accomplished<br>upon which he may set his heart.'"
