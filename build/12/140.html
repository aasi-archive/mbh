                            "Yudhishthira said, 'When both righteousness and men, O Bharata, decay in<br>consequence of the gradual lapse of Yuga, and when the world becomes<br>afflicted by robbers, how, O Grandsire, should a king then behave?'[419]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall tell thee, O Bharata, the policy the king should<br>Pursue at such distressful times. I shall tell thee how he should bear<br>himself at such a time, casting off compassion. In this connection is<br>cited the old story of the discourse between Bharadwaja and king<br>Satrunjaya. There was a king named Satrunjaya among the Sauviras. He was<br>a great car-warrior. Repairing to Bharadwaja, he asked the Rishi about<br>the truths of the science of Profit,&#8212;saying,&#8212;How can an unacquired<br>object be acquired? How again, when acquired, can it be increased? How<br>also, when increased, can it be protected? And how, when protected,<br>should it be used?&#8212;Thus questioned about the truths of the science of<br>Profit, the regenerate Rishi said the following words fraught with<br>excellent reason unto that ruler for explaining those truths.<br><br>"The Rishi said, 'The king should always stay with the rod of<br>chastisement uplifted in his hand. He should always display his prowess.<br>Himself without laches, he should mark the laches of his foes. Indeed,<br>his eyes should ever be used for that purpose. At the sight of a king who<br>has the rod of chastisement ever uplifted in his hand, every one is<br>struck with fear. For this reason, the king should rule all creatures<br>with the rod of chastisement. Men possessed of learning and knowledge of<br>truth applaud Chastisement. Hence, of the four requisites of rule, viz.,<br>Conciliation, Gift, Disunion, and Chastisement, Chastisement is said to<br>be the foremost. When the foundation of that which serves for a refuge is<br>cut away, all the refugees perish. When the roots of a tree are cut away,<br>how would the branches live? A king possessed of wisdom should cut away<br>the very roots of his foe. He should then win over and bring under his<br>sway the allies and partisans of that foe. When calamities overtake the<br>king, he should without losing time, counsel wisely, display his prowess<br>properly, fight with ability, and even retreat with wisdom. In speech<br>only should the king exhibit his humility, but at heart he should be<br>sharp as a razor. He should cast off lust and wrath, and speak sweetly<br>and mildly. When the occasion comes for intercourse with an enemy, a king<br>possessed of foresight should make peace, without reposing blind trust on<br>him. When the business is over, he should quickly turn away from the new<br>ally. One should conciliate a foe with sweet assurances as if he were a<br>friend. One, however, should always stand in fear of that foe as living<br>in a room within which there is a snake. He whose understanding is to be<br>dominated by thee (with the aid of thine intellect) should be comforted<br>by assurances given in the past. He who is of wicked understanding should<br>be assured by promises of future good. The person, however, that is<br>possessed of wisdom, should be assured by present services. The person<br>who is desirous of achieving prosperity should join hands, swear, use<br>sweet words, worship by bending down his head, and shed tears.[420] One<br>should bear one's foe on one's shoulders as long as time is unfavourable.<br>When however, the opportunity has come, one should break him into<br>fragments like an earthen jar on a stone. It is better, O monarch that a<br>king should blaze up for a moment like charcoal of ebony-wood than that<br>he should smoulder and smoke like chaff for many years. A man who has<br>many purposes to serve should not scruple to deal with even an ungrateful<br>person. If successful, one can enjoy happiness. If unsuccessful, one<br>loses esteem. Therefore in accomplishing the acts of such persons, one<br>should, without doing them completely, always keep something unfinished.<br>A king should do what is for his good, imitating a cuckoo, a boar, the<br>mountains of Meru, an empty chamber, an actor, and a devoted friend.[421]<br>The king should frequently, with heedful application, repair to the<br>houses of his foes, and even if calamities befall them, ask them about<br>their good. They that are idle never win affluence; nor they that are<br>destitute of manliness and exertion; nor they that are stained by vanity;<br>nor they that fear unpopularity; nor they that are always<br>procrastinating. The king should act in such a way that his foe may not<br>succeed in detecting his laches. He should, however, himself mark the<br>laches of his foes. He should imitate the tortoise which conceals its<br>limbs. Indeed, he should always conceal his own holes. He should think of<br>all matters connected with finance like a crane.[422] He should put forth<br>his prowess like a lion. He should lie in wait like a wolf and fall upon<br>and pierce his foes like a shaft. Drink, dice, women, hunting, and<br>music,&#8212;these he should enjoy judiciously. Addiction to these is<br>productive of evil. He should make bows with bamboos, etc.; he should<br>sleep cautiously like the deer; he should be blind when it is necessary<br>that he should be so, or he should even be deaf when it is necessary to<br>be deaf. The king possessed of wisdom should put forth his prowess,<br>regardful of time and place. If these are not favourable, prowess becomes<br>futile. Marking timeliness and untimeliness reflecting upon his own<br>strength and weakness, and improving his own strength by comparing it<br>with that of the enemy, the king should address himself to action. That<br>king who does not crush a foe reduced to subjection by military force,<br>provides for his own death like the crab when she conceives. A tree with<br>beautiful blossoms may be lacking in strength. A tree carrying fruits may<br>be difficult of climbing; and sometimes trees with unripe fruits look<br>like trees with ripe fruits. Seeing all these facts a king should not<br>allow himself to be depressed. If he conducts himself in such a way, then<br>he would succeed in upholding himself against all foes. The king should<br>first strengthen the hopes (of those that approach him as suitors). He<br>should then put obstacles in the way of the fulfilment of those hopes. He<br>should say that those obstacles are merely due to occasion. He should<br>next represent that those occasions are really the results of grave<br>causes. As long as the cause of fear does not actually come, the king<br>should make all his arrangements like a person inspired with fear. When,<br>however, the cause of fear comes upon him, he should smite fearlessly. No<br>man can reap good without incurring danger. If, again, he succeeds in<br>preserving his life amid danger, he is sure to earn great benefits.[423]<br>A king should ascertain all future dangers; when they are present, he<br>should conquer them; and lest they grow again, he should, even after<br>conquering them, think them to be unconquered. The abandonment of present<br>happiness and the pursuit of that which is future, is never the policy of<br>a person possessed Of intelligence. The king who having made peace with a<br>foe sleeps happily in truthfulness is like a man who sleeping on the top<br>of a tree awakes after a fall. When one falls into distress, one should<br>raise one's self by all means in one's power, mild or stern; and after<br>such rise, when competent, one should practise righteousness. The king<br>should always honour the foes of his foes. He should take his own spies<br>as agents employed by his foes. The king should see that his own spies<br>are not recognised by his foe. He should make spies of atheists and<br>ascetics and send them to the territories of his enemies. Sinful thieves,<br>who offend against the laws of righteousness and who are thorns in the<br>side of every person, enter gardens and places of amusement and houses<br>set up for giving drinking water to thirsty travellers and public inns<br>and drinking spots and houses of ill fame and holy places and public<br>assemblies. These should be recognised and arrested and put down. The<br>king should not trust the person that does not deserve to be trusted nor<br>should he trust too much the person that is deserving of trust. Danger<br>springs from trust. Trust should never be placed without previous<br>examination. Having by plausible reasons inspired confidence in the<br>enemy, the king should smite him when he makes a false step. The king<br>should fear him, from whom there is no fear; he should also always fear<br>them that should be feared. Fear that arises from an unfeared one may<br>lead to total extermination. By attention (to the acquisition of<br>religious merit), by taciturnity, by the reddish garb of ascetics, and<br>wearing matted locks and skins, one should inspire confidence in one's<br>foe, and then (when the opportunity comes) one should jump upon him like<br>the wolf. A king desirous of prosperity should not scruple to slay son or<br>brother or father or friend, if any of these seek to thwart his objects.<br>The very preceptor, if he happens to be arrogant, ignorant of what should<br>be done and, what should not, and a treader of unrighteous paths,<br>deserves to be restrained by chastisement. Even as certain insects of<br>sharp stings cut off all flowers and fruits of the trees on which they<br>sit, the king should, after having inspired confidence in his foe by<br>honours and salutations and gifts, turn against him and shear him of<br>everything. Without piercing the very vitals of others, without<br>accomplishing many stern deeds, without slaughtering living creatures<br>after the manner of the fisherman, one cannot acquire great prosperity.<br>There is no separate species of creatures called foes or friends. Persons<br>become friends or foes according to the force of circumstances. The king<br>should never allow his foe to escape even if the foe should indulge<br>piteous lamentations. He should never be moved by these; on the other<br>hand, it is his duty to destroy the person that has done him an injury. A<br>king desirous of prosperity should take care to attach to himself as many<br>men as he can, and to do them good. In behaving towards his subjects he<br>should always be free from malice. He should also, with great care,<br>punish and check the wicked and disaffected. When he intends to take<br>wealth, he should say what is agreeable. Having taken wealth, he should<br>say similar things. Having struck off one's head with his sword, he<br>should grieve and shed tears. A king desirous of prosperity should draw<br>others unto himself by means of sweet words, honours, and gifts. Even<br>thus should he bind men unto his service. The king should never engage in<br>fruitless disputes. He should never cross a river with the aid only of<br>his two arms. To eat cow-horns is fruitless and never invigorating. By,<br>eating them one's teeth are broken while the taste is not gratified. The<br>triple aggregate has three disadvantages with three Inseparable adjuncts.<br>Carefully considering those adjuncts, the disadvantages should be<br>avoided.[424] The unpaid balance of a debt, the unquenched remnant of a<br>fire, and the unslain remnant of foes, repeatedly grow and increase.<br>Therefore, all those should be completely extinguished and exterminated.<br>Debt, which always grows, is certain to remain unless wholly<br>extinguished. The same is the cause with defeated foes and neglected<br>maladies. These always produce great feat. (One should, therefore, always<br>eradicate them). Every act should be done thoroughly One should be always<br>heedful. Such a minute thing as a thorn, if extracted badly, leads to<br>obstinate gangrene. By slaughtering its population, by tearing up its<br>roads and otherwise injuring them, and by burning and pulling down its<br>houses, a king should destroy a hostile kingdom. A kings should be<br>far-sighted like the vulture, motionless like a crane, vigilant like a<br>dog, valiant like a lion, fearful like a crow, and penetrate the<br>territories of his foes like a snake with ease and without anxiety. A<br>king should win over a hero by joining his palms, a coward by inspiring<br>him with fear, and a covetous man by gifts of wealth while with an equal<br>he should wage war. He should be mindful of producing disunion among the<br>leaders of sects and of conciliating those that are dear to him. He<br>should protect his ministers from disunion and destructions. If the king<br>becomes mild, the people disregard him. If he becomes stern, the people<br>feel it as an affliction. The rule is that he should be stern when the<br>occasion requires sternness, and mild when the occasion requires<br>mildness. By mildness should the mild be cut. By mildness one may destroy<br>that which is fierce. There is nothing that mildness cannot effect. For<br>this reason, mildness is said to be sharper than fierceness. That king<br>who becomes mild when the occasion requires mildness and who becomes<br>stern when sternness is required, succeeds in accomplishing all his<br>objects, and in putting down his foes. Having incurred the animosity of a<br>person possessed of knowledge and wisdom, one should not draw comfort<br>from the conviction that one is at a distance (from one's foe).<br>Far-reaching are the arms of an intelligent man by which he injures when<br>injured. That should not be sought to be crossed which is really<br>uncrossable. That should not be snatched from the foe which the foe would<br>be able to recover. One should not seek to dig at all if by digging one<br>would not succeed in getting at the root of the thing for which one digs.<br>One should never strike him whose head one would not cut off. A king<br>should not always act in this way. This course of conduct that I have<br>laid down should be pursued only in seasons of distress. Inspired by the<br>motive of doing thee good I have said this for instructing thee as to how<br>thou shouldst bear thyself when assailed by foes.<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The ruler of the kingdom of the Sauviras, hearing<br>these words spoken by that Brahmana inspired with the desire of doing him<br>good, obeyed those instructions cheerfully and obtained with his kinsmen<br>and friends blazing prosperity.'"
