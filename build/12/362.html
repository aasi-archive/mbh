                            "The Brahmana said, 'Thou goest away for dragging the one-wheeled car of<br>Vivaswat according to thy turn. It behoveth thee to describe to me<br>anything wonderful that thou mayst have noticed in those regions through<br>which thou sojournest!'<br><br>"The Naga said, 'The divine Surya is the refuge or home of innumerable<br>wonders. All the creatures that inhabit the three worlds have flowed from<br>Surya. Innumerable Munis, crowned with ascetic success, together with all<br>the deities, reside in the rays of Surya like birds perching on the<br>branches of trees. What, again, can be more wonderful than this that the<br>mighty Wind, emanating from Surya, takes refuge in his ray and thence<br>yawns over the universe? What can be more wonderful than this, O<br>regenerate Rishi, that Surya, dividing the Wind into many portions from<br>desire of doing good to all creatures, creates rain that falls in the<br>rainy season? What can be more wonderful than this that the Supreme Soul,<br>from within the solar disc, himself bathed in blazing effulgence, looketh<br>upon the universe? What can be more wonderful than this that Surya has a<br>dark ray which transforms itself into clouds charged with rain and pours<br>showers of rain when the season comes? What can be more wonderful than<br>this that drinking up for eight months the rain he pours down, he pours<br>it down once again in the rainy season? In certain rays of Surya, the<br>Soul of the universe is said to reside. From Him is the seed of all<br>things, and it is He that upholds the Earth with all her mobile and<br>immobile creatures. What can be more wonderful, O Brahmana, than this,<br>that the foremost of Purushas, eternal and mighty-armed, endued with<br>exceeding effulgence, eternal, and without beginning and without end,<br>resides in Surya? Listen however, to one thing I shall tell you now. It<br>is the wonder of wonders. I have seen it in the clear sky, in consequence<br>of my adjacence to Surya. In former times, one day at the hour of noon,<br>while Surya was shining in all his glory and giving heat to everything we<br>beheld a Being coming towards Surya, who seemed to shine with effulgence<br>that was equal to that of Surya himself. Causing all the worlds to blaze<br>up with his glory and filling them with his energy, he came, as I have<br>already told thee, towards Surya, rending the firmament, as it were, for<br>making his path through it. The rays that emanated from his body seemed<br>to resemble the blazing effulgence of libations of clarified butter<br>poured into the sacrificial fire. In consequence of his energy and<br>splendour he could not be looked at. His form seemed to be indescribable.<br>Indeed, he appeared to us to be like a second Surya. As soon as he came<br>near, Surya extended his two hands (for giving him a respectful<br>reception). For honouring Surya in return, he also extended his<br>right-hand. The latter then, piercing through the firmament, entered into<br>Surya's disc. Mingling then with Surya's energy, he seemed to be<br>transformed into Surya's self. When the two energies thus met together,<br>we were so confounded that we could not any longer distinguish which was<br>which. Indeed, we could not make out who was Surya whom we bore on his<br>car, and who was the Being that we had seen coming through the sky.<br>Filled with confusion, we then addressed Surya, saying,&#8212;'O illustrious<br>one who is this Being that has mixed himself with thee and has been<br>transformed into thy second self?'
