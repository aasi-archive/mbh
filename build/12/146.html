                            "Bhishma said, 'Hearing these words fraught with morality and reason that<br>were spoken by his wife, the pigeon became filled with great delight and<br>his eyes were bathed in tears of joy. Beholding that fowler whose<br>avocation was the slaughter of birds, the pigeon honoured him<br>scrupulously according to the rites laid down in the ordinance.<br>Addressing him, he said, 'Thou art welcome today. Tell me, what I shall<br>do for thee. Thou shouldst not repine. This is thy home.[435] Tell me<br>quickly what I am to do and what is thy pleasure. I ask thee this in<br>affection, for thou hast solicited shelter at our hands. Hospitality<br>should be shown to even one's foe when he comes to one's house. The tree<br>withdraws not its shade from even the person that approaches it for<br>cutting it down. One should, with scrupulous care, do the duties of<br>hospitality towards a person that craves for shelter. Indeed, one is<br>especially bound to do so if one happens to lead a life of domesticity<br>that consists of the five sacrifices. If one, while leading a life of<br>domesticity, does not, from want of judgment, perform the five<br>sacrifices, one loses, according to the scriptures, both this and the<br>next world. Tell me then trustfully and in intelligible words what thy,<br>wishes are. I will accomplish them all. Do not set thy heart on grief.'<br>Hearing these words of the bird, the fowler replied unto him, saying, 'I<br>am stiff with cold. Let provision be made for warming me.' Thus<br>addressed, the bird gathered together a number of dry leaves on the<br>ground, and taking a single leaf in his beak speedily went away for<br>fetching fire. Proceeding to a spot where fire is kept, he obtained a<br>little fire and came back to the spot. He then set fire to those dry<br>leaves, and when they blazed forth into vigorous flames, he addressed his<br>guest, saying, 'Do thou trustfully and without fear warm thy limbs.' Thus<br>addressed, the fowler said, 'So be it.' And he set himself to warm his<br>stiffened limbs. Recovering (as it were) his life-breathes the fowler<br>said unto his winged host, 'Hunger is afflicting me. I wish thee to give<br>me some food.' Hearing his words the bird said, 'I have no stores by<br>which to appease thy hunger. We, denizens of the woods, always live upon<br>what we get every day. Like the ascetics of the forest we never hoard for<br>the morrow.' Having said these words, the bird's face became pale (from<br>shame). He began to reflect silently as to what he should do and mentally<br>deprecated his own method of living. Soon, however, his mind became<br>clear. Addressing the slaughterer of his species, the bird said, 'I shall<br>gratify thee. Wait for a moment.' Saying these words, he ignited a fire<br>with the help of some dry leaves, and filled with joy, said, 'I heard in<br>former days from high-souled Rishis and gods and Pitris that there is<br>great merit in honouring a guest. O amiable one, be kind to me. I tell<br>thee truly that my heart is set upon honouring thee that art my guest.'<br>Having formed this resolution, the high-souled bird with a smiling face,<br>thrice circumambulated that fire and then entered its flames. Beholding<br>he bird enter that fire, the fowler began to think, and asked himself,<br>'What have I done? Alas, dark and terrible will be my sin, without doubt<br>in consequence of my own acts! I am exceedingly cruel and worthy of<br>reprobation. Indeed, observing the bird lay down his life, the fowler,<br>deprecating his own acts, began to indulge in copious lamentations like<br>thee.'"
