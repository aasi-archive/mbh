                            "Bharadwaja said, 'How does bodily fire or heat, entering the body,<br>reside there? How also does the wind, obtaining space for itself, cause<br>the body to move and exert itself?'<br><br>"Bhrigu said, 'I shall, O regenerate one, speak to thee of the course in<br>which the wind moves, and how, O sinless one, that mighty element causes<br>the bodies of living creatures to move and exert themselves. Heat resides<br>within the head (brain) and protects the body (from perishing). The wind<br>or breath called Prana, residing within the head and the heat that is<br>there, cause all kinds of exertion. That Prana is the living creature,<br>the universal soul, the eternal Being, and the Mind, Intellect, and<br>Consciousness of all living creatures, as also all the objects of the<br>senses.[557] Thus the living creature is, in every respect, caused by<br>Prana to move about and exert. Them in consequence of the other breath<br>called Samana, every one of the senses is made to act as it does. The<br>breath called Apana, having recourse to the heat that is in the urethra<br>and the abdominal intestines, moves, engaged in carrying out urine and<br>faeces. That single breath which operates in these three, is called Udana<br>by those that are conversant with science. That breath which operates,<br>residing in all the joints of men's bodies, is called Vyana. There is<br>heat in the bodies of living creatures which is circulated all over the<br>system by the breath Samana. Residing thus in the body, that breath<br>operates upon the different kinds of watery and other elementary<br>substances and all bad humours. That heat, residing between Apana and<br>Prana, in the region of the navel, operates, with the aid of those two<br>breaths, in digesting all food that is taken by a living creature. There<br>is a duct beginning from the mouth down to the anal canal. Its extremity<br>is called the anus. From this main duct numerous subsidiary ones branch<br>out in the bodies of all living creatures.[558] In consequence of the<br>rush of the several breaths named above (through these ducts), those<br>breaths mingle together. The heat (that dwells in Prana) is called<br>Ushman. It is this heat that causes digestion in all creatures possessed<br>of bodies. The breath called Prana, the bearer of a current of heat,<br>descends (from the head) downwards to the extremity of the anal canal and<br>thence is sent upwards once more. Coming back to its seat in the head, it<br>once more sends down the heat it bears. Below the navel is the region of<br>digested matter. Above it is that for the food which is taken. In the<br>navel are all the forces of life that sustain the body. Urged by the ten<br>kinds of breaths having Prana for their first, the ducts (already<br>mentioned), branching out from the heart, convey the liquid juices that<br>food yields, upwards, downwards, and in transverse directions.[559] The<br>main duct leading from the mouth to the anus is the path by which yogins,<br>vanquishers of fatigue, of perfect equanimity in joy and sorrow, and<br>possessed of great patience, succeed in attaining to Brahma by holding<br>the soul within the brain.[560] Even thus is heat panted in the breaths<br>called Prana and Apana and others, of all embodied creatures. That heat<br>is always burning there like a fire placed in any (visible) vessel.'
