                            "Bhishma said, 'The dog transformed into a tiger, gratified with the<br>flesh of slain beasts, slept at his ease. One day as he lay on the yard<br>of the hermitage, an infuriated elephant came there, looking like a risen<br>cloud. Of huge stature, with rent cheeks, having signs of the lotus on<br>his body, and with broad frontal globes, the animal had long tusks and a<br>voice deep as that of the clouds. Beholding that infuriated elephant,<br>proud of his strength, approaching towards him, the tiger agitated with<br>fear, sought the protection of the Rishi. That best of sages thereupon<br>transformed the tiger into an elephant. The real elephant, seeing an<br>individual of his own species, huge as mass of clouds, became terrified.<br>The Rishi's elephant then, freckled with the dust of lotus filaments,<br>dived delightfully into lakes overgrown with lotuses and wandered by<br>their banks indented with rabbit holes. A considerable time elapsed in<br>this way. One day as the elephant was cheerfully striding along the<br>vicinity of the hermitage, there came before him unto that spot a maned<br>lion born in a mountain cave and accustomed to slay elephants. Beholding<br>the lion coming, the Rishi's elephant, from fear of life, began to<br>tremble and sought the protection of the sage. The sage thereupon<br>transformed that prince of elephants into a lion. As the wild lion was an<br>animal of same species with himself, the Rishi's lion no longer feared<br>him. On the other hand, the wild lion seeing a stronger beast of his own<br>species before him, became terrified. The Rishi's lion began to dwell in<br>that hermitage within the forest. Through fear of that animal, the other<br>animals no longer ventured to approach the hermitage. Indeed, they all<br>seemed to be inspired with fear about the safety of their lives. Some<br>time after one day, a slayer of all animals, possessed of great strength<br>inspiring all creatures with fright, having eight legs and eyes on the<br>forehead, viz., a Sarabha, came to that spot. Indeed he came to that very<br>hermitage for the object of slaying the Rishi's lion. Seeing this, the<br>sage transformed his lion into a Sarabha of great strength. The wild<br>Sarabha, beholding the Rishi's Sarabha before him to be fiercer and more<br>powerful, quickly fled away, from that forest. Having been thus<br>transformed into a Sarabha by the sage, the animal lived happily by the<br>side of his transformer. All the animals then that dwelt in the vicinity<br>became inspired with the fear of that Sarabha. Their fear and the desire<br>of saving their lives led them all to fly away from that forest. Filled<br>with delight, the Sarabha continued every day to slay animals for his<br>food. Transformed into a carnivorous beast, he no longer affected fruit<br>and roots upon which he had formerly lived. One day that ungrateful beast<br>who had first been a dog but who was now transformed into a Sarabha,<br>eagerly thirsting for blood, wished to slay the sage. The latter, by<br>ascetic power, saw it all by his spiritual knowledge. Possessed of great<br>wisdom, the sage, having ascertained the intentions of the beast,<br>addressed him in these words.'<br><br>"The sage said, 'O dog, thou wert first transformed into a leopard. From<br>a leopard thou wert then made a tiger. From a tiger thou wert next<br>transformed into an elephant with the temporal juice trickling down thy<br>cheeks. Thy next transformation was into a lion. From a mighty lion thou<br>wert then transformed into a Sarabha. Filled with affection for thee, it<br>was I that transformed thee into these diverse shapes. Thou didst not,<br>and dost not, belong by birth, to any of those species. Since, however, O<br>sinful wretch, thou desirest to stay me who have done thee no injury,<br>thou shalt return to thy own species and be a dog again.' After this,<br>that mean and foolish animal of wicked soul, transformed into a Sarabha<br>once more assumed, in consequence of the Rishi's curse, his own proper<br>form of a dog.'"
