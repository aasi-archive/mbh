                            "Yajnavalkya said, I have already spoken to thee of the science of the<br>Sankhyas. Listen now to me as I truly discourse on the science of the<br>Yogins as heard and seen by me, O best of kings! There is no knowledge<br>that can compare with that of the Sankhyas. There is no puissance that<br>compares with that of Yoga. These two ordain the same practices, and both<br>are regarded as capable of leading to Emancipation. Those men that are<br>not blest with intelligence regard the Sankhya and the Yoga systems to be<br>different from each other. We, however, O king, look upon them as one and<br>the same, according to the conclusion to which we have arrived (after<br>study and reflection). That which the Yogins have in view is the very<br>same which the Sankhyas also have in view. He who sees both the Sankhya<br>and the Yoga systems to be one and the same is to be regarded as truly<br>conversant with the topics or principles that ordain the universe. Know,<br>O king, that the vital breaths and the senses are the chief means for<br>practising Yoga. By only regulating those breaths and the senses, Yogins<br>wander everywhere at their will.[1655] When the gross body is destroyed,<br>Yogins endued with subtile bodies possessed of the eight Yoga attributes<br>of Anima, Laghima, Prapti, etc., wander over the universe, enjoying (in<br>that body) all kinds of felicities, O sinless one. The wise have, in the<br>scriptures, spoken of Yoga as conferring eight kinds of puissance. They<br>have spoken of Yoga as possessed of eight limbs.[1656] Indeed, O king,<br>they have not spoken of any other kind of Yoga. It has been said that the<br>practices of Yogins excellent as these are (for their results), are of<br>two kinds. Those two kinds, according to the indications occurring in the<br>scriptures, are practices endued with attributes and those freed from<br>attributes. The concentration of the mind on the sixteen objects named,<br>with simultaneous regulation of the breath, O king, is one kind. The<br>concentration of the mind in such a way as to destroy all difference<br>between the contemplator, the object contemplated, and the act of<br>contemplation along with subjugation of the senses, is of another kind.<br>The first kind of Yoga is said to be that possessed of attributes; the<br>second kind is said to be that freed from attributes.[1657] Then, again,<br>Regulation of the breath is Yoga with attributes. In Yoga without<br>attributes, the mind, freed from its functions, should be fixed. Only the<br>regulation of the breath which is said to be endued with attributes<br>should, in the first instance, be practised, for, O ruler of Mithila, if<br>the breath (that is inhaled and suspended) be exhaled without mentally<br>reflecting the while upon a definite image (furnished by a limited<br>mantra), the wind in the neophyte's system will increase to his great<br>injury.[1658] In the first Yama of the night, twelve ways of holding the<br>breath are recommended. Alter sleep, in the last Yama of the night, other<br>twelve ways of doing the same have been laid down. Without doubt, one<br>endued with tranquillity, of subdued senses, living in retirement,<br>rejoicing in one's own self, and fully conversant with the import of the<br>scriptures, should (regulating one's breath in these four and twenty<br>ways) fix one's Soul (on the Supreme Soul).[1659] Dispelling the five<br>faults of the five senses, viz., (withdrawing them from their objects of)<br>sound, form, touch, taste, and scent, and dispelling those conditions<br>called Pratibha and Apavarga, O ruler of the Mithilas, all the senses<br>should be fixed upon the mind. The mind should then be fixed on<br>Consciousness, O king, Consciousness should next be fixed on intelligence<br>or Buddhi, and Buddhi, should then be fixed on Prakriti. Thus merging<br>these one after another, Yogins contemplate the Supreme Soul which is<br>One, which is freed from Rajas, which is stainless, which is Immutable<br>and Infinite and Pure and without defect, who is Eternal Purusha, who is<br>unchangeable, who is Indivisible, who is without decay and death, who is<br>everlasting, who transcends diminution, and which is Immutable Brahma.<br>Listen now, O monarch, to the indications of one that is in Yoga. All the<br>indications of cheerful contentment that are his who is slumbering in<br>contentment are seen in the person, that is in Samadhi. The person in<br>Samadhi, the wise say, looks like the fixed and upward flame of a lamp<br>that is full of oil and that burns in a breezeless spot. He is like a<br>rock which is incapable of being moved in the slightest degree by ever a<br>heavy downpour from the clouds. He is incapable of being moved by the din<br>of conches and drums, or by songs or the sound of hundreds of musical<br>instruments beat or blown together. Even this is the indication of one in<br>Samadhi. As a man of cool courage and determination, while ascending a<br>flight of steps with a vessel full of oil in his hands, does not spill<br>even a drop of the liquid if frightened and threatened by persons armed<br>with weapons even so the Yogin, when his mind has been concentrated and<br>when he beholds the Supreme Soul in Samadhi, does not, in consequence of<br>the entire stoppage of the functions of his senses at such a time, move<br>in the slightest degree. Even these should be known to be the indication<br>of the Yogin while he is in Samadhi. While in Samadhi, the Yogin beholds<br>Brahma which is Supreme and Immutable, and which is situated like a<br>blazing Effulgence in the midst of thick Darkness. It is by this means<br>that he attains, after many years, to Emancipation after casting off this<br>inanimate body. Even this is what the eternal Sruti declares. This is<br>called the Yoga of the Yogins. What else is it? Knowing it, they that are<br>endued with wisdom regard themselves as crowned with success,&#8212;
