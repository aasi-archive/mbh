                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast discoursed on the four modes of life and<br>their duties. Thou hast also spoken of the duties of kings. Thou hast<br>recited many histories of diverse kinds and connected with diverse<br>topics. I have also heard from thee, O thou of great intelligence, many<br>discourses connected with morality. I have, however, one doubt. It<br>behoveth thee to resolve it. I wish, O Bharata, to hear of the fruits<br>that silent Reciters of sacred mantras acquire (by their practice). What<br>are the fruits that have been indicated for such men? What is that region<br>to which they go after death? It behoveth thee also, O sinless one, to<br>tell me all the rules that have been laid down in respect of such silent<br>recitation? When the word Reciter is uttered, what shall I understand by<br>it? Is such a man to be regarded as following the ordinances of Sankhya<br>or yoga or work?[621] Or, is such a man to be regarded as observing the<br>ordinances about (mental) sacrifices? How is the path of the Reciters to<br>be called? Thou art, as I think, of universal knowledge. Tell me all<br>this.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old history of what<br>transpired between Yama, Time, and a certain Brahmana. Sages conversant<br>with the means of attaining to Emancipation have spoken of two methods,<br>viz., the Sankhya and the yoga. Amongst these, in the former, which is<br>otherwise called the Vedanta, Renunciation has been preached with respect<br>to silent recitation. The declarations of the Vedas preach Abstention<br>(from rites), are fraught with tranquillity, and are concerned with<br>Brahma.[622] Indeed, the two paths spoken of by sages bent on achieving<br>what is for their good, viz., Sankhya and yoga, are such that they are<br>both concerned and again unconcerned (with silent recitations).[623] The<br>manner in which silent recitation is connected (with each of the two<br>paths) and the cause I shall now explain. In both as in the case of<br>silent recitation, are needed the subduing of the senses and the fixing<br>of the mind (after withdrawal from external objects); as also truth<br>keeping up of the (sacred) fire, residence in solitude, meditation,<br>penance, self-restraint, forgiveness, benevolence, abstemiousness in<br>respect of food, withdrawal from worldly attachments, the absence of<br>talkativeness, and tranquillity. These constitute a sacrifice in acts<br>(leading to the fruition of desire about heaven or felicity in next<br>life).[624] Listen now to the course that consists of abstention (from<br>acts). The manner in which the acts of the Reciter observing the vow of<br>Brahmacharya may cease, I will presently declare. Such a person should<br>conduct himself in every way according to what has been (already) said by<br>me.[625] Betaking himself to the path of abstention, he should seek to<br>extinguish his dependence on both the External and the Internal. Sitting<br>on kusa grass, with kusa in hand, and binding his coronal locks with<br>kusa, he should surround himself with kusa and have kusa for robes.<br>Bowing unto all earthly concerns, he should take leave of them and never<br>think of them. Assuming equability by the aid of his mind, he should fix<br>his mind on the mind itself. Reciting the highly beneficial composition<br>(viz., the Gayatri), he meditates with the aid of his intellect on Brahma<br>alone. Afterwards he leaves off even that, being then absorbed in<br>concentrated contemplation.[626] In consequence of his dependence on the<br>strength of the Gayatri which he recites, this concentrated contemplation<br>will come of itself. By penances he attains to purity of soul, and<br>self-restraint, and cessation of aversion and desire. Freed from<br>attachment and delusion, above the influence of all pairs of opposites<br>(such as heat and cold, joy and sorrow, etc.), he never grieves and never<br>suffers himself to be drawn towards worldly objects. He does not regard<br>himself as the actor nor as the enjoyer or sufferer of the consequences<br>of his acts. He never, through selfishness, fixes his mind on anything.<br>Without being employed in the acquisition of wealth, he abstains also<br>from disregarding or insulting others, but not from work. The work in<br>which he is employed is that of meditation; he is devoted to meditation,<br>and seeks meditation unalterably. By meditation he succeeds in bringing<br>about concentrated contemplation, and then gradually leaves off<br>meditation itself. In that state he enjoys the felicity which attaches to<br>the abandonment of all things. Having thoroughly mastered the principle<br>of desire he casts off his life-breaths and then enters into the Brahmic<br>body. Or, if he does not desire to enter into the Brahmic body, he at<br>once goes upwards into the region of Brahma and has never to undergo<br>rebirth. Having become tranquillity's self, and being freed from all<br>kinds of calamity, such a person, by depending upon his own intelligence,<br>succeeds in attaining to that Soul which is pure and immortal and which<br>is without a stain.'"
