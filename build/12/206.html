                            "Manu said, 'When the fivefold attributes are united with the five senses<br>and the mind, then is Brahma seen by the individual like a thread passing<br>through a gem. As a thread, again, may lie within gold or pearl or a<br>coral or any object made of earth, even so one's soul, in consequence of<br>one's own acts, may live within a cow, a horse, a man, an elephant, or<br>any other animal, or within a worm or an insect. The good deeds an<br>individual performs in a particular body produce rewards that the<br>individual enjoys in that particular body. A soil, apparently drenched<br>with one particular kind of liquid, supplies to each different kind of<br>herb or plant that grows on it the sort of juice it requires for itself.<br>After the same manner, the Understanding, whose course is witnessed by<br>the soul, is obliged to follow the path marked out by the acts of<br>previous lives.[695] From knowledge springs desire. From desire springs<br>resolution. From resolution flows action. From action proceed fruits<br>(i.e., consequences, good and bad). Fruits, therefore, are dependent on<br>actions as their cause. Actions have the understanding for their cause.<br>The understanding has knowledge for its cause; and knowledge has the Soul<br>for its cause. That excellent result which is achieved in consequence of<br>the destruction of knowledge, of fruits, of the understanding, and of<br>acts, is called Knowledge of Brahma.[696] Great and high is that<br>self-existent Essence, which yogins behold. They that are devoid of<br>wisdom, and whose understandings are devoted to worldly possessions never<br>behold that which exists in the Soul itself. Water is superior to the<br>Earth in extension; Light is superior to Water; Wind is superior to<br>Light; Space is superior to Wind; Mind is superior to Space;<br>Understanding is superior to Mind; Time is superior to Understanding. The<br>divine Vishnu, whose is this universe, is superior to Time. That god is<br>without beginning, middle, and end. In consequence of his being without<br>beginning, middle, and end, he is Unchangeable. He transcends all sorrow,<br>for sorrow has limits.[697] That Vishnu hath been called the Supreme<br>Brahma. He is the refuge or object of what is called the Highest. Knowing<br>Him, they that are wise, freed from everything that owns the power of<br>Time, attain to what is called Emancipation. All these (that we perceive)<br>are displayed in attributes. That which is called Brahma, being without<br>attributes, is superior to these.[698] Abstention from acts is the<br>highest religion. That religion is sure to lead to deathlessness<br>(Emancipation). The Richs, the Yajuses, and the Samans, have for their<br>refuge the body. They flow from the end of the tongue. They cannot be<br>acquired without effort and are subject to destruction. Brahma, however,<br>cannot be acquired in this way, for (without depending upon the body) it<br>depends upon that (i.e., the knower or Soul) which has the body for its<br>refuge. Without beginning, middle, or end, Brahma cannot be acquired by<br>exertion (like to what is necessary for the acquirement of the Vedas).<br>The Richs, the Samans, the Yajuses have each a beginning. Those that have<br>a beginning have also an end. But Brahma is said to be without beginning.<br>And because Brahma hath neither beginning nor end, it is said to be<br>infinite and unchangeable. In consequence of unchangeableness, Brahma<br>transcends all sorrow as also all pairs of opposites. Through<br>unfavourable destiny, through inability to find out the proper means, and<br>through the impediments offered by acts, mortals succeed not in beholding<br>the path by which Brahma may be reached. In consequence of attachment to<br>worldly possessions, of a vision of the joys of the highest heaven, and<br>of coveting something other than Brahma, men do not attain to the<br>Supreme.[699] Others beholding worldly objects covet their possession.<br>Desirous of such objects, they have no longing for Brahma in consequence<br>of its transcending all attributes.[700] How shall he that is attached to<br>attributes which are inferior, arrive at a knowledge of him that is<br>possessed of attributes that are superior? It is by inference that one<br>can arrive at a knowledge of Him that transcends all this in attributes<br>and form. By subtile intelligence alone can we know Him. We cannot<br>describe Him in words. The mind is seizable by the mind, the eye by<br>eye.[701] By knowledge the understanding can be purified of its dross.<br>The understanding may be employed for purifying the mind. By the mind<br>should the senses be controlled. Achieving all this, one may attain to<br>the Unchangeable. One who has, by contemplation, become freed from<br>attachments, and who has been enriched by the possession of a discerning<br>mind, succeeds in attaining to Brahma which is without desire and above<br>all attributes. As the wind keeps away from the fire that is embedded<br>within a piece of wood, even so persons that are agitated (by desire for<br>worldly possessions) keep away from that which is Supreme. Upon the<br>destruction of all earthly objects, the mind always attains to That which<br>is higher than the Understanding; while upon their separation the mind<br>always acquires that which is below the Understanding. That person, who,<br>in conformity with the method already described, becomes engaged in<br>destroying earthly objects, attains to absorption into the body of<br>Brahma.[702] Though the Soul is unmanifest; yet when clothed with<br>qualities, its acts become unmanifest. When dissolution (of the body)<br>comes, it once more becomes manifest. The Soul is really inactive. It<br>exists, united with the senses that are productive of either happiness or<br>sorrow. United with all the senses and endued with body, it takes refuge<br>in the five primal elements. Through want of power, however, it fails to<br>act when deprived of force by the Supreme and Unchangeable. No man sees<br>the end of the earth but knows this, viz., that the earth's end Will<br>surely come.[703] Man, agitated here (by attachments), is surely led to<br>his last refuge like the wind leading a vessel tossed on the sea to a<br>safe harbour at last. The Sun, spreading his rays, becomes the possessor<br>of an attribute, (viz., the lighter of the world): withdrawing his rays<br>(at the hour of setting), he once more becomes an object divested of<br>attributes. After the same manner, a person, abandoning all distinctions<br>(attachments), and betaking himself to penances, at last enters the<br>indestructible Brahma which is divested of all attributes. By discerning<br>Him who is without birth, who is the highest refuge of all righteous<br>persons, who is self-born, from whom everything springs and unto whom all<br>things return, who is unchangeable, who is without beginning, middle, and<br>end, and who is certainty's self and supreme, a person attains to<br>immortality (Emancipation).'"
