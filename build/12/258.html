                            "Narada said, 'The large-eyed lady, controlling her grief by an effort of<br>her own, addressed the Grandsire, with joined hands and bending in an<br>attribute of humility like a creeper. And she said, 'How, O foremost of<br>speakers, shall a lady like me that has sprung from thee proceed to<br>accomplish such a terrible feat,&#8212;a feat, that is, which is sure to<br>inspire all living creatures with dread? I fear to do aught that is<br>iniquitous. Do thou appoint such work for me as is righteous. Thou seest<br>that I am frightened. Oh, cast a compassionate glance upon me. I shall<br>not be able to cut off living creatures,&#8212;infants, youths, and aged<br>ones,&#8212;who have done me no injury. O lord of all creatures, I bow to<br>thee, be gratified with me. I shall not be able to cut off dear sons and<br>loved friends and brothers and mothers and fathers. If these die (through<br>my act), their surviving relatives will surely curse me. I am filled with<br>fear at the prospect of this.[1111] The tears of the sorrow-stricken<br>survivors will burn me for eternity. I am very much afraid of them (whose<br>relatives I shall have to cut off). I seek thy protection. All sinful<br>creatures (slain by me) will have to sink into the infernal regions. I<br>seek to gratify thee, O boon-giving god! Extend to me thy grace, O<br>puissant lord! I seek the gratification of this wish, O Grandsire, of all<br>the worlds. O foremost of all the gods, I seek, through thy grace, even<br>this object, viz., permission to undergo severe austerities.'<br><br>"The Grandsire said, 'O Death, thou hast been intended by me for the<br>destruction of all creatures. Go, and set thyself to the task of slaying<br>all. Do not reflect (upon the propriety or otherwise of this act). This<br>must certainly be. It cannot be otherwise. O sinless one, O lady of<br>faultless limbs, do thou accomplish the behest I have uttered.' Thus<br>addressed, O thou of Mighty arms, the lady called Death, O conqueror of<br>hostile cities, spoke not a word, but humbly stood there with her eyes<br>upturned towards the puissant Lord of all creatures. Brahman addressed<br>her repeatedly, but the lady seemed to be herself deprived of life.<br>Beholding her thus, the god of gods, that lord of lords, became silent.<br>Indeed, the Self-born, by an effort of his will, became gratified.<br>Smiling, the lord of all the worlds then cast his eyes on the universe.<br>It has been heard by us that when that unconquered and illustrious lord<br>subdued his wrath, the lady (called Death) went away from his side.<br>Leaving Brahman's side without having promised to accomplish the<br>destruction of living creatures, Death quickly proceeded, O king, to the<br>sacred spot known by the name of Dhenuka. There the goddess practised the<br>severest austerities for five and ten billions of years, all the while<br>standing upon one foot.[1112] After she practised such exceedingly severe<br>austerities in that place, Brahman of great energy once more said unto<br>her, 'Do thou accomplish my behest, O Death!' Disregarding this command,<br>the lady once more practised penances standing upon one foot for twenty<br>billions of years, O giver of honours! And once more, O son, she led a<br>life in the woods with the deer for another long period consisting of ten<br>thousand billions of years.[1113] And once, O foremost of men, she passed<br>twice ten thousand years, living upon air only as her sustenance. Once<br>again, O monarch, she observed the excellent vow of silence for eight<br>thousand years, passing the whole time in water. Then that maiden, O best<br>of kings, went to the river Kausiki. There she began to pass her days in<br>the observance of another vow, living the while upon only water and air.<br>After this, O monarch, the blessed maiden proceeded to the Ganges and<br>thence to the mountains of Meru. Moved by the desire of doing good to all<br>living creatures, she stood perfectly motionless there like a piece of<br>wood. Proceeding thence to the summit of Himavat where the deities had<br>performed their great sacrifice, she stood there for another hundred<br>billions of years, supporting her weight upon only the toes of her feet<br>with the object of gratifying the Grandsire with such an act of<br>austerity. Wending thither, the Creator and Destroyer of the universe<br>again addressed her saying, 'Upon what art thou engaged, O daughter?<br>Accomplish those words of mine.' Addressing the divine Grandsire, the<br>maiden once more said, 'I am unable to cut off living creatures, O god! I<br>seek to gratify thee (so that I may be excused of this behest).'<br>Frightened at the prospect of demerit she prayed the Grandsire for being<br>excused of obedience to his command, the Grandsire silenced her, and once<br>more addressed her, saying, 'No demerit will accrue, O Death! Do thou, O<br>auspicious maiden, set thyself to the task of destroying living<br>creatures. That which I have uttered, O amiable girl, cannot certainly be<br>falsified. Eternal righteousness shall now take refuge in thee. Myself<br>and all the deities shall always be employed in seeking thy good. This<br>other wish that is in thy heart I grant thee. Living creatures shall be<br>afflicted by disease, and (dying) shall cast the blame on thee. Thou<br>shalt become a male in all male beings, a female in all female beings,<br>and a eunuch in all those that are of the third sex.[1114] Thus addressed<br>by Brahman, O king, the maiden at last said, with joined hands unto that<br>high-souled and undeteriorating lord of all the deities, these words, 'I<br>am unable to obey thy command.' The great God, without relenting, again,<br>said unto her, 'O Death, do thou kill men. I shall so ordain that thou<br>shalt not incur any demerit by doing this, O auspicious lady! Those tear<br>drops that I see fallen from thy eyes, and that thou still boldest in thy<br>joined hands, shall take the form of terrible diseases and even they<br>shall destroy men when their hours come. When the end comes of living<br>creatures, thou shalt despatch Desire and Wrath together against them.<br>Immeasurable merit shall be thine. Thou shalt not incur iniquity, being<br>thyself perfectly equal in thy behaviour.[1115] By doing this thou wilt<br>only observe righteousness instead of sinking thyself into iniquity. Do<br>thou, therefore, set thy heart upon the task at hand, and addressing<br>Desire and Wrath begin to slay all living creatures.' Thus addressed,<br>that lady, called by the name of Death, became afraid of Brahman's curse<br>and answered him, saying, 'Yes!' From that time she began to despatch<br>Desire and Wrath as the last hours of living creatures and through their<br>agency to put a stop to their life-breaths. Those tears that Death had<br>shed are the diseases by which the bodies of men become afflicted. At the<br>destruction, therefore, of living creatures, one should not,<br>understanding, with the aid of the intelligence (to what cause such<br>destruction is due), give way to grief. As the senses of all creatures<br>disappear when the latter become plunged into dreamless sleep and return<br>once more when they awake, after the same manner all human beings, upon<br>the dissolution of their bodies, have to go into the other world and<br>return thence to this, O lion among kings! The element called wind, that<br>is endued with terrible energy and mighty prowess and deafening roars,<br>operates as the life in all living creatures. That wind, when the bodies<br>of living creatures are destroyed, escaping from the old becomes engaged<br>in diverse functions in diverse new bodies. For this reason, the wind is<br>called the lord of the senses and is distinguished above the other<br>elements constituting the gross body. The gods, without exception, (when<br>their merits cease), have to take birth as mortal creatures on earth.<br>Similarly, all mortal creatures also (when they acquire sufficient<br>merit), succeed in attaining to the status of gods. Therefore, O lion<br>among kings, do not grieve for thy son. Thy son has attained to heaven<br>and is enjoying great happiness there! It was thus, O monarch, that Death<br>was created by the Self-born and it is in this way that she cuts off duly<br>all living creatures when their hours come. The tears she had shed become<br>diseases, which, when their last hours come, snatch away all beings<br>endued with life.'"
