                            "Yudhishthira said, 'How, O Bharata, should a learned man adorned with<br>modesty behave, O chastiser of foes, when assailed with harsh speeches in<br>the midst of assemblies by an ignorant person swelling with conceit?'[346]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O lord of earth, how the subject has been treated<br>of (in the scriptures), how a person of good soul should endure in this<br>world the abusive speeches of persons of little intelligence. If a<br>person, when abused by another, do not yield to wrath, he is then sure to<br>take away (the merit of) all the good deeds that have been done by the<br>abuser. The endurer, in such a case, communicates the demerit of all his<br>own bad acts to the person who under the influence of wrath indulges in<br>abuse. An intelligent man should disregard an abusive language who<br>resembles, after all, only a Tittibha uttering dissonant cries.[347] One<br>who yields to hate is said to live in vain. A fool may often be heard to<br>say, 'Such a respectable man was addressed by me in such words amid such<br>an assembly of men,' and to even boast of that wicked act. He would add,<br>'Abused by me, the man remained silent as if dead with shame. Even thus<br>does a shameless man boast of an act about which no one should boast.<br>Such a wretch among men should carefully be disregarded. The man of<br>wisdom should endure everything that such a person of little intelligence<br>may say. What can a vulgar fellow do by either his praise or his blame?<br>He is even like a crow that caws uselessly in the woods. If those who<br>accuse others by only their words could establish those accusations by<br>such means, then, perhaps, their words would have been regarded to be of<br>some value. As a fact, however, these words are as effective as those<br>uttered by fools invoking death upon them with whom they quarrel.[348]<br>That man simply proclaims his bastardy who indulges in such conduct and<br>words. Indeed, he is even like a peacock that dances while showing such a<br>part of his body as should be ever concealed from the view.[349] A person<br>of pure conduct should never even speak with that wight of sinful conduct<br>who does not scruple to utter anything or do anything. That man who speak<br>of one's merits when one's eye is upon him and who speaks ill of one when<br>one's eye is withdrawn from him, is really like a dog. Such a person<br>loses all his regions in heaven and the fruits of any knowledge and<br>virtue that he may have.[350] The man who speaks ill of one when one's<br>eye is not upon him, loses without delay the fruits of all his libations<br>on fire and of the gifts he may make unto even a hundred persons. A man<br>of wisdom, therefore, should unhesitatingly avoid a person of such sinful<br>heart who deserves to be avoided by all honest men, as he would avoid the<br>flesh of the dog. That wicked-souled wretch who proclaims the faults of a<br>high-souled person, really publishes (by that act) his own evil nature<br>even as a snake displays his hood (when interfered with by others). The<br>man of sense who seeks to counteract such a back-biter ever engaged in an<br>occupation congenial to himself, finds himself in the painful condition<br>of a stupid ass sunk in a heap of ashes. A man who is ever engaged in<br>speaking ill of others should be avoided like a furious wolf, or an<br>infuriated elephant roaring in madness, or a fierce dog. Fie on that<br>sinful wretch who has betaken himself to the path of the foolish and has<br>fallen away from all wholesome restraints and modesty, who is always<br>engaged in doing what is injurious to others, and who is regardless of<br>his own prosperity. If an honest man wishes to exchange words with such<br>wretches when they seek to humiliate him, he should be counselled in<br>these words: Do not suffer thyself to be afflicted. A wordy encounter<br>between a high and a low person is always disapproved by persons of<br>tranquil intelligence. A slanderous wretch, when enraged, may strike<br>another with his palms, or throw dust or chaff at another, or frighten<br>another by showing or grinding his teeth. All this is well known. That<br>man who endures the reproaches and slanders of wicked-souled wights<br>uttered in assemblies, or who reads frequently these instructions, never<br>suffers any pain occasioned by speech.'
