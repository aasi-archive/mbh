                            Vaisampayana said, "Like a person unwilling to forgive an insult, Arjuna<br>of keen speech and prowess, and possessed of energy, betraying great<br>fierceness and licking the Corners of his mouth, said these words of<br>grave import, smiling the while: 'Oh, how painful, how distressing! I<br>grieve to see this great agitation of thy heart, since having achieved<br>such a superhuman feat, thou art bent upon forsaking this great<br>prosperity. Having slain thy foes, and having acquired the sovereignty of<br>the earth which has been won through observance of the duties of thy own<br>order, why shouldst thou abandon everything through fickleness of heart?<br>Where on earth hath a eunuch or a person of procrastination ever acquired<br>sovereignty? Why then didst thou, insensate with rage, slay all the kings<br>of the earth? He that would live by mendicancy, cannot, by any act of<br>his, enjoy the good things of the earth. Divested of prosperity and<br>without resources, he can never win fame on earth or acquire sons and<br>animals. If, O king, abandoning this swelling kingdom, thou livest in the<br>observance of the wretched mode of life led by a mendicant, what will the<br>world say of thee? Why dost thou say that abandoning all the good things<br>of the earth, divested of prosperity, and reft of resources, thou wilt<br>lead a life of mendicancy like a vulgar person? Thou art born in this<br>race of kings. Having won by conquest the whole earth, wishest thou from<br>folly to live in the woods after abandoning everything of virtue and<br>profit? If thou retirest into the woods, in thy absence, dishonest men<br>will destroy sacrifices. That sin will certainly pollute thee. King<br>Nahusha, having done many wicked acts in a state of poverty, cried fie on<br>that state and said that poverty is for recluses. Making no provision for<br>the morrow is a practice that suits Rishis. Thou knowest this well. That,<br>however, which has been called the religion of royalty depends entirely<br>on wealth. One who robs another of wealth, robs him of his religion as<br>well.[9] Who amongst us, therefore, O king, would forgive an act of<br>spoliation that is practised on us? It is seen that a poor man, even when<br>he stands near, is accused falsely. Poverty is a state of sinfulness. It<br>behoveth thee not to applaud poverty, therefore. The man that is fallen,<br>O king, grieveth, as also he that is poor. I do not see the difference<br>between a fallen man and a poor man. All kinds of meritorious acts flow<br>from the possession of great wealth like a mountain. From wealth spring<br>all religious acts, all pleasures, and heaven itself, O king! Without<br>wealth, a man cannot find the very means of sustaining his life. The acts<br>of a person who, possessed of little intelligence, suffers himself to be<br>divested of wealth, are all dried up like shallow streams in the summer<br>season. He that has wealth has friends. He that has wealth has kinsmen.<br>He that has wealth is regarded as a true man in the world. He that has<br>wealth is regarded as a learned man. If a person who hath no wealth<br>desires to achieve a particular purpose, he meets with failure. Wealth<br>brings about accessions of wealth, like elephants capturing (wild)<br>elephants. Religious acts, pleasures, joy, courage, wrath, learning, and<br>sense of dignity, all these proceed from wealth, O king! From wealth one<br>acquires family honour. From wealth, one's religious merit increases. He<br>that is without wealth hath neither this world, nor the next, O best of<br>men! The man that hath no wealth succeeds not in performing religious<br>acts, for these latter spring from wealth, like rivers from a mountain.<br>He that is lean in respect of (his possession of) steeds and kine and<br>servants and guests, is truly lean and not he whose limbs alone are so.<br>Judge truly, O king, and look at the conduct of the gods and the Danavas.<br>O king, do the gods ever wish for anything else than the slaughter of<br>their kinsmen (the Asuras)? If the appropriation of wealth belonging to<br>others be not regarded as righteous, how, O monarch, will kings practise<br>virtue on this earth? Learned men have, in the Vedas, laid down this<br>conclusion. The learned have laid it down that kings should live,<br>reciting every day the three Vedas, seeking to acquire wealth, and<br>carefully performing sacrifices with the wealth thus acquired. The gods,<br>through internecine quarrels, have obtained footing in heaven. When, the<br>very gods have won their prosperity through internecine quarrels, what<br>fault can there be in such quarrels? The gods, thou seest, act in this<br>way. The eternal precepts of the Vedas also sanction it. To learn, teach,<br>sacrifice, and assist at other's sacrifices,&#8212;these are our principal<br>duties. The wealth that kings take from others becomes the means of their<br>prosperity. We never see wealth that has been earned without doing some<br>injury to others. It is even thus that kings conquer this world. Having<br>conquered, they call that wealth theirs, just as sons speak of the wealth<br>of their sires as their own. The royal sages that have gone to heaven<br>have declared this to be the duty of kings. Like water flowing on every<br>direction from a swollen ocean, that wealth runs on every direction from<br>the treasuries of kings. This earth formerly belonged to king Dilipa,<br>Nahusha, Amvarisha, and Mandhatri. She now belongs to thee! A great<br>sacrifice, therefore, with profuse presents of every kind and requiring a<br>vast heap of the earth's produce, awaits thee. If thou dost not perform<br>that sacrifice, O king, then the sins of this kingdom shall all be thine.<br>Those subjects whose king performs a horse-sacrifice with profuse<br>presents, become all cleansed and sanctified by beholding the ablutions<br>at the end of the sacrifice. Mahadeva himself, of universal form, in a<br>great sacrifice requiring libations of all kinds of flesh, poured all<br>creatures as sacrificial libations and then his own self. Eternal is this<br>auspicious path. Its fruits are never destroyed. This is the great path<br>called Dasaratha. Abandoning it, O king, to what other path wouldst thou<br>betake thyself?'
