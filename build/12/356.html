The<br>gratification that a traveller who has made a long journey on foot feels<br>when he lies down on a bed, that which a person feels when he finds a<br>seat after having stood for a long while for want of room, or that which<br>is felt by a thirsty person when he finds a glass of cool water, or that<br>which is felt by a hungry man when he finds savoury food set before him,<br>or that which a guest feels when a dish of desirable food is placed<br>before him at the proper time, or that which is felt by an old man when<br>after long coveting he gets a son, or that which is experienced by one<br>when meeting with a dear friend or relative about whom one had become<br>exceedingly anxious, resembles that with which I have been filled in<br>consequence of these words uttered by thee.[1931] Like a person with<br>upturned gaze I have heard what has fallen from thy lips and am<br>reflecting upon their import. With these wise words of thine thou hast<br>truly instructed me! Yes, I shall do what thou hast commanded me to do.<br>Thou mayst go tomorrow at dawn, passing the night happily with me and<br>dispelling thy fatigue by such rest. Behold, the rays of the divine Surya<br>have been partially dimmed and the god of day is proceeding in his<br>downward course!"<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Hospitably waited upon by that Brahmana, the learned<br>guest, O slayer of foes, passed that night in the company of his host.<br>Indeed, both of them passed the night happily, conversing cheerfully with<br>each other on the subject of the duties of the fourth mode of life, viz.,<br>Sannyasa (Renunciation). So engrossing was the nature of their<br>conversation that the night passed away as if it were day. When morning<br>came, the guest was worshipped with due rites by the Brahmana whose heart<br>had been eagerly set upon the accomplishment of what (according to the<br>discourse of the guest) was regarded by him to be beneficial for himself.<br>Having dismissed his guest, the righteous Brahmana, resolved to achieve<br>his purpose, took leave of his kinsmen and relatives, and set out in due<br>time for the abode of that foremost of Nagas, with heart steadily<br>directed towards it.'"
