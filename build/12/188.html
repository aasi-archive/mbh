                            "Bhrigu said, 'Brahman first created a few Brahmanas who came to be<br>called Prajapatis (lords of creation). Possessed of splendour equal to<br>that of the fire or the Sun, they were created out of the energy of that<br>First-born Being. The puissant Lord then created Truth, Duty, Penance,<br>the eternal Vedas, all kinds of pious acts, and Purity, for enabling<br>creatures to attain to heaven (by practising them). After this, the<br>Deities and the Danavas, the Gandharvas, the Daityas, the Asuras, the<br>great snakes, the Yakshas, the Rakshasas, the Serpents, the Pisachas, and<br>human beings with their four divisions, viz., Brahmanas, Kshatriyas,<br>Vaisyas, and Sudras, O best of regenerate ones, and all the other orders<br>of creatures that exist, were created. The complexion the Brahmanas<br>obtained was white; that which the Kshatriyas obtained was red; that<br>which the Vaisyas got was yellow; and that which was given to the Sudras<br>was black.'<br><br>"Bharadwaja said, 'If the distinction between the four orders (of human<br>beings) be made by means only of colour (attribute), then it seems that<br>all the four orders have been mingled together.[562] Lust, wrath, fear,<br>cupidity, grief, anxiety, hunger, toil, possess and prevail over all men.<br>How can men be distinguished by the possession of attributes? The bodies<br>of all men emit sweat, urine, faeces, phlegm, bile, and blood. How then<br>can men be distributed into classes? Of mobile objects the number is<br>infinite; the species also of immobile objects are innumerable. How,<br>then, can objects of such very great diversity be distributed into<br>classes?'<br><br>"Bhrigu said, 'There is really no distinction between the different<br>orders. The whole world at first consisted of Brahmanas. Created (equal)<br>by Brahman, men have, in consequence of their acts, become distributed<br>into different orders. They that became fond of indulging in desire and<br>enjoying pleasures, possessed of the attributes of severity and wrath,<br>endued with courage, and unmindful of the duties of piety and<br>worship,&#8212;these Brahmanas possessing the attribute of Passion,&#8212;became<br>Kshatriyas. Those Brahmanas again who, without attending to the duties<br>laid down for them, became possessed of both the attributes of Goodness<br>and Passion, and took to the professions of cattle-rearing and<br>agriculture, became Vaisyas. Those Brahmanas again that became fond of<br>untruth and injuring other creatures, possessed of cupidity,&#8212;engaged in<br>all kinds of acts for a living, and fallen away from purity of behaviour,<br>and thus wedded to the attribute of Darkness, became Sudras. Separated by<br>these occupations, Brahmanas, falling away from their own order, became<br>members of the other three orders. All the four orders, therefore, have<br>always the right to the performance of all pious duties and of<br>sacrifices. Even thus were the four orders at first created equal by<br>Brahman who ordained for all of them (the observances disclosed in) the<br>words of Brahma (in the Vedas). Through cupidity alone, many fell away,<br>and became possessed by ignorance. The Brahmanas are always devoted to<br>the scriptures on Brahma; and mindful of vows and restraints, are capable<br>of grasping the conception of Brahma. Their penances therefore, never go<br>for nothing. They amongst them are not Brahmanas that are incapable of<br>understanding that every created thing is Supreme Brahma. These, falling<br>away, became members of diverse (inferior) orders. Losing the light of<br>knowledge, and betaking themselves to an unrestrained course of conduct,<br>they take birth as Pisachas and Rakshasas and Pretas and as individuals<br>of diverse Mleccha species. The great Rishis who at the beginning sprang<br>into life (through Brahman's Will) subsequently created, by means of<br>their penances, men devoted to the duties ordained for them and attached<br>to the rites laid down in the Eternal Vedas. That other Creation,<br>however, which is eternal and undecaying, which is based upon Brahma and<br>has sprung from the Primeval God, and which has its refuge upon yoga, is<br>a mental one.'"[563]
