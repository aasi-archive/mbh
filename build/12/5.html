                            "Narada said, 'Hearing of the fame of Karna's might, the ruler of the<br>Magadhas, king Jarasandha, challenged him to a single combat. Both<br>conversant with the celestial weapons, a fierce battle took place between<br>them in which they struck each other with diverse kinds of arms. At last<br>when their arrows were exhausted and bows and swords were broken and they<br>both became carless, they began, possessed of might as they were, to<br>fight with bare arms. While engaged with him in mortal combat with bare<br>arms, Karna was about to sever the two portions of his antagonist's body<br>that had been united together by Jara. The king (of Magadha), then after<br>feeling himself very much pained, cast off all desire of hostility and<br>addressed Karna, saying, 'I am gratified.' From friendship he then gave<br>unto Karna the town Malini. Before this, that tiger among men and<br>subjugator of all foes (viz., Karna) had been king of the Angas only, but<br>from that time the grinder of hostile forces began to rule over Champa<br>also, agreeably to the wishes of Duryodhana, as thou knowest. Thus Karna<br>became famous on earth for the valour of his arms. When, for thy good,<br>the Lord of the celestials begged of him his (natural) coat of mail and<br>ear-rings, stupefied by celestial illusion, he gave away those precious<br>possessions. Deprived of his car-rings and divested of his natural<br>armour, he was slain by Arjuna in Vasudeva's presence. In consequence of<br>a Brahmana's curse, as also of the curse of the illustrious Rama, of the<br>boon granted to Kunti and the illusion practised on him by Indra, of his<br>depreciation by Bhishma as only half a car-warrior, at the tale of Rathas<br>and Atirathas, of the destruction of his energy caused by Salya (with his<br>keen speeches), of Vasudeva's policy, and, lastly of the celestial<br>weapons obtained by Arjuna from Rudra and Indra and Yama and Varuna and<br>Kuvera and Drona and the illustrious Kripa, the wielder of Gandiva<br>succeeded in slaying Vikartana's son Karna of effulgence like that of<br>Surya himself. Even thus had thy brother been cursed and beguiled by<br>many. As, however, he has fallen in battle, thou shouldst not grieve for<br>that tiger among men!'"
