                            "Yudhishthira said, 'If there is any efficacy in gifts, in sacrifices, in<br>penances well-performed, and in dutiful services rendered to preceptors<br>and other reverend seniors, do thou, O grandsire, speak of the same to<br>me. "Bhishma said, 'An understanding associated with evil causes the mind<br>to fall into sin. In this state one stains one's acts, and then falls<br>into great distress. Those that are of sinful acts have to take birth as<br>persons of very indigent circumstances. From famine to famine, from pain<br>to pain, from fear to fear, is their change. They are more dead than<br>those that are dead. Possessed of affluence, from joy to joy, from heaven<br>to heaven, from happiness to happiness, proceed they that are possessed<br>of faith, that are self-restrained, and that are devoted to righteous<br>deeds. They that are unbelievers have to pass, with groping hands,<br>through regions infested by beasts of prey and elephants and pathless<br>tracts teeming with snakes and robbers and other causes of fear. What<br>more need be said of these? They, on the other hand, that are endued with<br>reverence for gods and guests, that are liberal, that have proper regard<br>for persons that are good, and that make gifts in sacrifices, have for<br>theirs the path (of felicity) that belongs to men of cleansed and subdued<br>souls. Those that are not righteous should not be counted among men even<br>as grains without kernel are not counted among grain and as cockroaches<br>are not counted among birds. The acts that one does, follow one even when<br>one runs fast. Whatever acts one does, lie down with the doer who lays<br>himself down. Indeed, the sins one does, sit when the doer sits, and run<br>when he runs. The sins act when the doer acts, and, in fact follow the<br>doer like his shadow. Whatever the acts one does by whatever means and<br>under whatever circumstances, are sure to be enjoyed and endured (in<br>respect of their fruits) by the doer in his next life. From every side<br>Time is always dragging all creatures, duly observing the rule in respect<br>of the distance to which they are thrown and which is commensurate with<br>their acts.[1735] As flowers and fruits, without being urged, never<br>suffer their proper time to pass away without making their appearance,<br>even so the acts one has done in past life make their appearance at the<br>proper time. Honour and dishonour, gain and loss, destruction and growth,<br>are seen to set in. No one can resist them (when they come). One of them<br>is enduring, for disappear it must after appearance. The sorrows one<br>suffers is the result of one's acts. The happiness one enjoys flows from<br>one's acts. From the time when one lies within the mother's womb one<br>begins to enjoy and endure one's acts of a past life. Whatever acts good<br>and bad one does in childhood, youth, or old age, one enjoys and endures<br>their consequences in one's next life in similar ages. As the calf<br>recognises its dam even when the latter may stand among thousands of her<br>species, after the same manner the acts done by one in one's past life<br>come to one n one's next life (without any mistake) although one may live<br>among thousands of one's species. As a piece of dirty cloth is whitened<br>by being washed in water, after the same manner, the righteous, cleansed<br>by continuous exposure unto the fire of fasts and penances, at last<br>attain to unending happiness. O thou of high intelligence, the desires<br>and purposes of those whose sins have been washed off by long-continued<br>penances well-performed, become crowned with fruition. The track of the<br>righteous cannot be discerned even as that of birds in the, sky or that<br>of fishes in the water. There is no need of speaking ill of others, nor<br>of reciting the instances in which others have tripped. On the other<br>hand, one should always do what is delightful, agreeable, an beneficial<br>to one's own self.'"[1736]
