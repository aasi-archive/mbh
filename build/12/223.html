                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, by adopting what sort of<br>intelligence may a monarch, who has been divested of prosperity and<br>crushed by Time's heavy bludgeon, still live on this earth.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative of the<br>discourse between Vasava and Virochana's son, Vali. One day Vasava, after<br>having subjugated all the Asuras, repaired to the Grandsire and joining<br>his hands bowed to him and enquired after the whereabouts of Vali. Tell<br>me, O Brahman, where I may now find that Vali whose wealth continued<br>undiminished even though he used to give it away as lavishly as he<br>wished. He was the god of wind. He was Varuna. He was Surya. He was Soma.<br>He was Agni that used to warm all creatures. He became water (for the use<br>of all). I do not find where he now is. Indeed, O Brahman, tell me where<br>I may find Vali now. Formerly, it was he who used to illumine all the<br>points of the compass (as Surya) and to set (when evening came). Casting<br>off idleness, it was he who used to pour rain upon all creatures at the<br>proper season. I do not now see that Vali. Indeed, tell me, O Brahmana,<br>where I may find that chief of the Asuras now.'<br><br>"Brahman said, 'It is not becoming in thee, O Maghavat, to thus enquire<br>after Vali now. One should not, however, speak an untruth when one is<br>questioned by another. For this reason, I shall tell thee the whereabouts<br>of Vali. O lord of Sachi, Vali may now have taken his birth among camels<br>or bulls or asses or horses, and having become the foremost of his<br>species may now be staying in an empty apartment.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'If, O Brahman, I happen to meet with Vali in an empty<br>apartment, shall I slay him or spare him? Tell me how I shall act.'<br><br>"Brahman said, 'Do not, O Sakra, injure Vali, Vali does not deserve<br>death. Thou shouldst, on the other hand, O Vasava, solicit instruction<br>from him about morality, O Sakra, as thou pleasest.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by the divine Creator, Indra roamed<br>over the earth, seated on the back of Airavata and attended by<br>circumstances of great splendour. He succeeded in meeting with Vali, who,<br>as the Creator had said, was living in an empty apartment clothed in the<br>form of an ass.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'Thou art now, O Danava, born as an ass subsisting on chaff<br>as thy food. This thy order of birth is certainly a low one. Dost thou or<br>dost thou not grieve for it? I see what I had never seen before, viz.,<br>thyself brought under the sway of thy enemies, divested of prosperity and<br>friends, and shorn of energy and prowess. Formerly, thou used to make<br>progress through the worlds with thy train consisting of thousands of<br>vehicles and thousands of kinsmen, and to move along, scorching everybody<br>with thy splendour and counting us as nought. The Daityas, looking up to<br>thee as their protector, lived under thy sway. Through thy power, the<br>earth used to yield crops without waiting for tillage. Today, however, I<br>behold thee overtaken by this dire calamity. Dost thou or dost thou not<br>indulge in grief for this? When formerly thou usedst, with pride<br>reflected in thy face, to divide on the eastern shores of the ocean thy<br>vast wealth among thy kinsmen, what was the state of thy mind then?<br>Formerly, for many years, when blazing with splendour, thou usedst to<br>sport, thousands of celestial damsels used to dance before thee. All of<br>them were adorned with garlands of lotuses and all had companions bright<br>as gold. What, O lord of Danavas, was the state of thy mind then and what<br>is it now? Thou hadst a very large umbrella made of gold and adorned with<br>jewels and gems. Full two and forty thousand Gandharvas used in those<br>days to dance before thee.[835] In thy sacrifices thou hadst a stake that<br>was very large and made entirely of gold. On such occasions thou wert to<br>give away millions upon millions of kine. What, O Daitya, was the state<br>of thy mind then? Formerly, engaged in sacrifice, thou hadst gone round<br>the whole earth, following the rule of the hurling of the Samya: What was<br>the state of thy mind then?[836] I do not now behold that golden jar of<br>thine, nor that umbrella of thine, nor those fans. I behold not also, O<br>king of the Asuras, that garland of thine which was given to thee by the<br>Grandsire.'<br><br>"Vali said, 'Thou seest not now, O Vasava, my jar and umbrella and fans.<br>Thou seest not also my garland, that gift of the Grandsire. Those<br>precious possessions of mine about which thou askest are now buried in<br>the darkness of a cave. When my time comes again, thou wilt surely behold<br>them again. This conduct of thine, however, does not become thy fame or<br>birth. Thyself in prosperity, thou desirest to mock me that am sunk in<br>adversity. They that have acquired wisdom, and have won contentment<br>therefrom, they that are of tranquil souls, that are virtuous and good<br>among creatures, never grieve in misery nor rejoice in happiness. Led,<br>however, by a vulgar intelligence, thou indulgest in brag, O Purandara!<br>When thou shalt become like me thou shalt not then indulge in speeches<br>like these.'"
