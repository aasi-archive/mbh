                            "Yudhishthira said. 'There are no practices, O king, more sinful than<br>those of the Kshatriyas. In marching or in battle, the king slays large<br>multitudes.[287] By what acts then does the king win regions of felicity?<br>O bull of Bharata's race, tell this, O learned one, unto me that desire<br>to know.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'By chastising the wicked, by attaching and cherishing the<br>good, by sacrifices and gifts, kings become pure and cleansed. It is<br>true, kings desirous of victory afflict many creatures, but after victory<br>they advance and aggrandise all. By the power of gifts, sacrifices, and<br>penances, they destroy their sins, and their merit increases in order<br>that they may be able to do good to all creatures. The reclaimer of a<br>field, for reclaiming it, takes up both paddy-blades and weeds. His<br>action, however, instead of destroying the blades or paddy, makes them<br>grow more vigorously. They that wield weapons, destroy many that deserve<br>destruction. Such extensive destruction, however, causes the growth and<br>advancement of those that remain. He who protects people from plunder,<br>slaughter, and affliction, in consequence of thus protecting their lives<br>from robbers, comes to be regarded as the giver of wealth, of life, and<br>of food. The king, therefore, by thus adoring the deities by means of a<br>union of all sacrifices whose Dakshina is the dispelling of everybody's<br>fear, enjoys every kind of felicity here and attains to a residence in<br>Indra's heaven hereafter.[288] That king who, going out, fights his foes<br>in battles that have arisen for the sake of Brahmanas and lays down his<br>life, comes to be regarded as the embodiment of a sacrifice with<br>illimitable presents. If a king, with his quivers full of shafts, shoots<br>them fearlessly at his foes, the very gods do not see anyone on earth<br>that is superior to him. In such a case, equal to the number of shafts<br>with which he pierces the bodies of his enemies, is the number of regions<br>that he enjoys, eternal and capable of granting every wish. The blood<br>that flows from his body cleanses him of All his sins along with the very<br>pain that he feels on the occasion. Persons conversant with the<br>scriptures say that the pains a Kshatriya suffers in battle operate as<br>penances for enhancing his merit. Righteous persons, inspired with fear,<br>stay in the rear, soliciting life from heroes that have rushed to battle,<br>even as men solicit rain from the clouds. If those heroes, without<br>permitting the beseechers to incur the dangers of battle, keep them in<br>the rear by themselves facing those dangers and defend them at that time<br>of fear, great becomes their merit. If, again, those timid p sons,<br>appreciating that deed of bravery, always respect those defenders, they<br>do what is proper and just. By acting otherwise they cannot free<br>themselves from fear. There is great difference between men apparently<br>equal. Some rush to battle, amid its terrible din, against armed ranks of<br>foes. Indeed, the hero rushes against crowds of foes, adopting the road<br>to heaven. He, however, who is inspired with dastardly fear, seeks safety<br>in flight, deserting his comrades in danger. Let not such wretches among<br>men be born in thy race. The very gods with Indra at their head send<br>calamities unto them that desert their comrades in battle and come with<br>unwounded limbs. He who desires to save his own life-breaths by deserting<br>his comrades, should be slain with sticks or stones or rolled in a mat of<br>dry grass for being burnt to death. Those amongst the Kshatriyas that<br>would be guilty of such conduct should be killed after the manner of<br>killing animals.[289] Death on a bed of repose, after ejecting phlegm and<br>urine and uttering piteous cries, is sinful for a Kshatriya. Persons<br>acquainted with the scriptures do not applaud the death which a Kshatriya<br>encounters with unwounded body. The death of a Kshatriya, O sire, at home<br>is not praiseworthy. They are heroes. Any unheroic act of theirs is<br>sinful and inglorious. In disease, one may be heard to cry, saying, 'What<br>sorrow! How painful! I must be a great sinner.' With face emaciated and<br>stench issuing fro in his body and clothes, the sick man plunges his<br>relatives into grief. Coveting the condition of those that are hale, such<br>a man (amidst his tortures) repeatedly desires for death itself. One that<br>is a hero, having dignity and pride, does not deserve such in inglorious<br>death. Surrounded by kinsmen and slaughtering his foes in battle, a<br>Kshatriya should die at the edge of keen weapons. Moved by desire of<br>enjoyment and filled with rage, a hero fights furiously and does not feel<br>the wounds inflicted on his limbs by foes. Encountering death in battle,<br>he earns that high merit fraught with fame and respect of the world which<br>belongs to his or her and ultimately obtains a residence in Indra's<br>heaven. The hero, by not showing his back in fight and contending by<br>every means in his power, in utter recklessness of life itself, at the<br>van of battle, obtains the companionship of Indra. Wherever the hero<br>encountered death in the midst, of foes without displaying ignoble fear<br>or cheerlessness, he has succeeded in earning regions hereafter of<br>eternal bliss.'"
