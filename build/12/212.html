                            "Bhishma said, 'Persons engaged in the practice of acts regard the<br>practice of acts highly. Similarly, those that are devoted to Knowledge<br>do not regard anything other than Knowledge. Persons fully conversant<br>with the Vedas and depending upon the utterances contained in them, are<br>rare. They that are more intelligent desire the path of abstention from<br>acts as the better of the two, viz., heaven and emancipation.[727]<br>Abstention from acts is observed by those that are possessed of great<br>wisdom. That conduct, therefore, is laudable. The intelligence which<br>urges to abstention from acts, is that by which one attains to<br>Emancipation. Possessed of body, a person, through folly, and endued with<br>wrath and cupidity and all the propensities born of Passion and Darkness,<br>becomes attached to all earthly objects. One, therefore, who desires to<br>destroy one's connection with the body, should never indulge in any<br>impure act. On the other hand, one should create by one's acts a path for<br>attaining to emancipation, without wishing for regions of felicity (in<br>the next world).[728] As gold, when united with iron, loses its purity<br>and fails to shine, even so Knowledge, when existing with attachment to<br>earthly objects and such other faults, fails to put forth its<br>splendour.[729] He who, influenced by cupidity and following the dictates<br>of desire and wrath, practises unrighteousness, transgressing the path of<br>righteousness, meets with complete destruction.[730] One who is desirous<br>of benefiting oneself should never follow, with excess of attachments,<br>earthly possessions represented by the objects of the senses. If one does<br>it, wrath and joy&#8212;and sorrow arise from one another (and make one<br>miserable). When every one's body is made up of the five original<br>elements as also of the three attributes of Goodness, Passion, and<br>Darkness, whom shall one adore and whom shall one blame with what words?<br>Only they that are fools become attached to the objects of the senses. In<br>consequence of folly they do not know that their bodies are only<br>modifications.[731]<br><br>As a house made of earth is plastered over with earth, even so this body<br>which is made of earth is kept from destruction by food which is only a<br>modification of earth. Honey and oil and milk and butter and meat and<br>salt and treacle and grain of all kinds and fruit and roots are all<br>modifications of earth and water. Recluses living in the wilderness,<br>giving up all longing (for rich and savoury food), take simple food, that<br>is again unsavoury, for only supporting the body. After the same manner,<br>a person that dwells in the wilderness of the world, should be ready for<br>labour and should take food for passing through life, like a patient<br>taking medicine.[732] A person of noble soul, examining all things of an<br>earthly nature that come upon him, by the aid of truth, purity, candour,<br>a spirit of renunciation, enlightenment, courage, forgiveness, fortitude,<br>intelligence, reflection, and austerities, and desirous of obtaining<br>tranquillity, should restrain his senses. All creatures, stupefied, in<br>consequence of Ignorance, by the attributes of Goodness and Passion and<br>Darkness, are continually revolving like a wheel. All faults, therefore,<br>that are born of Ignorance, should be closely examined and the idea of<br>Self which has its origin in Ignorance, and which is productive of<br>misery, should be avoided. The fivefold elements, the senses, the<br>attributes of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness, the three worlds with the<br>Supreme Being himself, and acts, all rest on Self-consciousness.[733] As<br>Time, under its own laws, always displays the phenomena of the seasons<br>one after another, even so one should know that Consciousness in all<br>creatures is the inducer of acts.[734] Tamas (from which proceeds<br>Consciousness) should be known as productive of delusions. It is like<br>Darkness and is born of Ignorance. To the three attributes of Goodness,<br>Passion, and Darkness are attached all the joys and sorrows (of<br>creatures). Listen now to those consequences that spring from the<br>attributes of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness. Contentment, the<br>satisfaction that arises from joy, certainty, intelligence, and<br>memory,&#8212;these are the consequences born of the attribute of Goodness. I<br>shall now mention the consequences of Passion and Darkness. Desire,<br>wrath, error, cupidity, stupefaction, fear, and fatigue, belong to the<br>attribute of Passion. Cheerlessness, grief, discontent, vanity, pride,<br>and wickedness, all belong to Darkness. Examining the gravity or<br>lightness of these and other faults that dwell in the Soul, one should<br>reflect upon each of them one after another (for ascertaining which of<br>them exist, which have become strong or weak, which have been driven off,<br>and which remain).'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'What faults are abandoned by persons desirous of<br>Emancipation? What are those that are weakened by them? What are the<br>faults that come repeatedly (and are, therefore, incapable of being got<br>rid of)? What, again, are regarded as weak, through stupefaction (and,<br>therefore, as permissible)? What, indeed, are those faults upon whose<br>strength and weakness a wise man should reflect with the aid of<br>intelligence and of reasons? I have doubts upon these subjects. Discourse<br>to me on these, O grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'A person of pure Soul, by extracting all his faults by<br>their roots, succeeds in obtaining Emancipation. As an axe made of steel<br>cuts a steel chain (and accomplishing the act becomes broken itself),<br>after the same manner, a person of cleansed Soul, destroying all the<br>faults that spring from Darkness and that are born with the Soul (when it<br>is reborn), succeeds in dissolving his connection with the body (and<br>attaining Emancipation).[735] The qualities having their origin in<br>Passion, those that spring from Darkness, and those stainless one<br>characterised by purity (viz., those included under the quality of<br>Goodness), constitute as it were the seed from which all embodied<br>creatures have grown. Amongst these, the attribute of Goodness alone is<br>the cause through which persons of cleansed Souls succeed in attaining to<br>Emancipation. A person of cleansed soul, therefore, should abandon all<br>the qualities born of Passion and Darkness. Then again, when the quality<br>of Goodness becomes freed from those of Passion and Darkness, it becomes<br>more resplendent still. Some say that sacrifices and other acts performed<br>with the aid of mantras, and which certainly contribute to the<br>purification of the Soul, are evil or cruel acts. (This view is not<br>correct). On the other hand, those acts are the chief means for<br>dissociating the Soul from all worldly attachments, and for the<br>observance of the religion of tranquillity. Through the influence of the<br>qualities born of Passion, all unrighteous acts are performed, and all<br>acts fraught with earthly purposes as also all such acts as spring from<br>desire are accomplished. Through qualities born of Darkness, one does all<br>acts fraught with cupidity and springing from wrath. In consequence of<br>the attribute of Darkness, one embraces sleep and procrastination and<br>becomes addicted to all acts of cruelty and carnal pleasure. That person,<br>however, who, possessed of faith and scriptural knowledge, is observant<br>of the attribute of Goodness, attends only to all good things, and<br>becomes endued with (moral) beauty and soul free from every taint.'
