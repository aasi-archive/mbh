                            "Usanas said, 'I bow to that divine and illustrious and puissant Being<br>who holds this earth with the firmament in his arms. I shall speak to<br>thee of the pre-eminent greatness of that Vishnu whose head, O best of<br>the Danavas, is that Infinite place (called Emancipation).'<br><br>"While they were thus conversing with each other there came unto them the<br>great sage Sanatkumara of righteous soul for the purpose of dispelling<br>their doubts. Worshipped by the prince of Asuras and by the sage Usanas,<br>that foremost of sages sat down on a costly seat. After Kumara of great<br>wisdom had been seated (at his ease), Usanas said unto him, 'Discourse to<br>this chief of the Danavas on the pre-eminent greatness of Vishnu.'<br>Hearing these words, Sanatkumara uttered the following, fraught with<br>grave import, upon the pre-eminent greatness of Vishnu unto the<br>intelligent chief of the Danavas, 'Listen, O Daitya, to everything about<br>the greatness of Vishnu. Know, O scorcher of foes, that the entire<br>universe rests on Vishnu. O thou of mighty arms, it is He who creates all<br>creatures mobile and immobile. In course of Time it is He, again, who<br>withdraws all things and in Time it is He who once more casts them forth<br>from Himself. Into Hari all things merge at the universal destruction and<br>from Him all things again come forth. Men possessed of scriptural lore<br>cannot obtain him by such lore. Nor can He be obtained by Penances, nor<br>by Sacrifices. The only means by which He can be attained is by<br>restraining the Senses. Nor that sacrifices are entirely useless towards<br>such an end. For one, by relying upon both external and internal acts,<br>and upon one's own mind, can purify (them) by one's own understanding. By<br>such means, one succeeds in enjoying infinity in the world.[1353] As a<br>goldsmith purifies the dross of his metal by repeatedly casting it into<br>the fire with very persistent efforts of his own, after the same manner<br>Jiva succeeds in cleaning himself by his course through hundreds of<br>births. Some one may be seen to purify himself in only one life by mighty<br>efforts. As one should with care wipe stains from off one's person before<br>they become thick, after the same manner one should, with vigorous<br>efforts, wash off one's faults.[1354] By mixing only a few flowers with<br>them, grains of sesame cannot be made to cast off their own odour (and<br>become at once fragrant). After the same manner, one cannot, by cleansing<br>one's heart only a little, succeed in beholding the Soul. When, however,<br>those grains are perfumed repeatedly with the aid of a large quantity of<br>flowers, it is then that they cast off their own odour and assume that of<br>the flowers with which they are mixed. After this manner, faults, in the<br>form of attachments to all our environments, are dispelled by the<br>understanding in course of many lives, with the aid of a large dose of<br>the attribute of the Sattwa, and by means of efforts born of<br>practice.[1355] Listen, O Danava, by what means creatures attached to<br>acts and those unattached to them attain the causes that lead to their<br>respective states of mind.[1356] Listen to me with undivided attention. I<br>shall, in their due order, discourse to thee, O puissant Danava, as to<br>how creatures betake themselves to action and how they give up<br>action.[1357] The Supreme Lord creates all creatures mobile and immobile.<br>He is without beginning and without end. Unendued with attributes of any<br>kind, he assumes attributes (when he chooses to create). He is the<br>universal Destroyer, the Refuge of all things, the Supreme Ordainer, and<br>pure Chit.[1358] In all creatures it is He who dwells as the mutable and<br>the immutable. It is He who, having eleven modifications for His essence,<br>drinketh this universe with His rays.[1359] Know that the Earth is His<br>feet. His head is constituted by Heaven. His arms, O Daitya, are the<br>several points of the compass or the horizon. The intermediate space is<br>His ears. The light of His eye is the Sun, and His mind is in the Moon.<br>His understanding dwells always in Knowledge, and His tongue is in<br>Water.[1360] O best of Danavas, the Planets are in the midst of His<br>brows. The starts and constellations are from the light of His eyes. The<br>Earth is in His feet. O Danava! Know also that the attributes of Rajas,<br>Tamas, and Sattwa are of Him. He is the fruit (or end) of all the modes<br>of life, and He it is who should be known as the fruit (or reward) of all<br>(pious) acts (such as Japa and Sacrifice, etc.).[1361] The Highest and<br>Immutable, He is also the fruit of abstention from all work. The Chandas<br>are the hair on His body, and Akshara (or Pranava) is His word. The<br>diverse orders (of men) and the modes of life are His refuge. His mouths<br>are many. Duty (or religion) is planted in his heart. He is Brahma; He is<br>the highest Righteousness; He is Sat and He is Asat;[1362] He is Sruti;<br>He is the scriptures; He is the Sacrificial vessel; He is the six and ten<br>Ritwijes; He is all the Sacrifices; He is the Grandsire (Brahman); He is<br>Vishnu; He is the twin Aswins; and He is Purandara;[1363] He is Mitra; He<br>is Varuna; He is Yama; He is Kuvera the lord of treasures. Although the<br>Ritwijes seem to behold Him as separate, He is, however, known to them as<br>one and the same. Know that this entire universe is under the control of<br>One divine Being.[1364] The Veda that is in the soul, O prince of<br>Daityas, regards the unity of various creatures. When a living creature<br>realises this unity in consequence of true knowledge, he is then said to<br>attain to Brahma. The period of time for which one creation exists or for<br>which if ceases to exist is called a Kalpa. Living creatures exist for a<br>thousand millions of such Kalpas. Immobile creatures also exist for an<br>equal period. The period for which a particular creation exists is<br>measured by many thousands of lakes (in the following way), O Daitya!<br>Conceive a lake that is one Yojana in width, one Krosa in depth, and five<br>hundred Yojanas in length. Imagine many thousands of such lakes. Seek<br>then to dry up those lakes by taking from them, only once a day, as much<br>water as may be taken up with the end of a single hair. The number of<br>days would pass in drying them up completely by this process represents<br>the period that is occupied by the life of one creation from its first<br>start to the time of its destruction.[1365] The highest Evidence (for all<br>things) says that creatures have six colours, viz., Dark, Tawny, Blue,<br>Red, Yellow, and White. These colours proceed from mixtures in various<br>proportions of the three attributes of Rajas, Tamas, and Sattwa. Where<br>Tamas predominates, Sattwa falls below the mark, and Rajas keeps to the<br>mark, the result is the colour called Dark. When Tamas predominates as<br>before, but the relations between Sattwa and Rajas are reversed, the<br>result is the colour called Tawny. When Rajas predominates, Sattwa falls<br>below the mark, and Tamas keeps to the mark, the result is the colour<br>called Blue. When Rajas predominates as before and the proportion is<br>reversed between Sattwa and Tamas, the result is the intermediate colour<br>called Red. That Colour is more agreeable (than the preceding one). When<br>Sattwa predominates, Rajas falls below the mark and, Tamas keeps to the<br>mark, the result is the colour called Yellow. It is productive of<br>happiness. When Sattwa predominates and the proportion is reversed<br>between Rajas and Tamas, the result is the colour called White. It is<br>productive of great happiness.[1366] The White is the foremost colour. It<br>is sinless in consequence of its being free from attachment and aversion.<br>It is without grief, and free from the toil involved in Pravritti. Hence,<br>White, O prince of Danavas, leads to success (or Emancipation). Jiva, O<br>Daitya, having undergone thousands of births derived through the womb,<br>attains to success.[1367] That success is the identical end which the<br>divine Indra declared after having studied many auspicious spiritual<br>treatises and which has for its essence the apprehension of the Soul. The<br>end again that creatures obtain is dependent oil their colour, and<br>colour, in its turn, depends upon the character of the Time that sets in,<br>O Daitya![1368] The stages of existence, O Daitya, through which Jiva<br>must pass are not unlimited. They are fourteen hundreds of thousands ill<br>number. In consequence of them Jiva ascends, stays, and falls down as the<br>case may be.[1369] The end that is attained by a Jiva of dark flue is<br>very low, for he becomes addicted to acts that lead to hell and then has<br>to rot in hell.[1370] The learned say that in consequence of his<br>wickedness, the continuance (in such form) of a Jiva is measured by many<br>thousands of Kalpas.[1371] Having passed many hundred thousands of years<br>in that condition, Jiva then attains to the colour called Tawny (and<br>becomes born as an intermediate creature). In that condition he dwells<br>(for many long years), in perfect helplessness. At last when his sins are<br>exhausted (in consequence of his having endured all the misery they are<br>capable of bringing), his mind, casting off all attachments, cherishes<br>Renunciation.[1372] When Jiva becomes endued with the quality of Sattwa,<br>he then dispels everything connected with Tamas by the aid of his<br>intelligence, and exerts (for achieving what is for his good). As the<br>result of this, Jiva attains to the colour called Red. If the quality of<br>Sattwa, however, be not gained, Jiva then travels in a round of rebirths<br>in the world of inert, having attained to the colour called Blue.[1373]<br>Having attained to that end (viz., Humanity) and having been afflicted<br>for the duration of one creation by the bonds born of his own acts, Jiva<br>then attains to the colours called Yellow (or becomes a Deity). Existing<br>in that condition for the space of a hundred creations, he then leaves it<br>(for becoming a human being) to return to it once more.[1374] Having<br>attained to the Yellow colour, Jiva exists for thousands of Kalpas,<br>sporting as a Deva. Without, however, being emancipated (even then), he<br>has to stay in hell, enjoying or enduring the fruits of his acts of past<br>Kalpas and wandering through nine and ten thousand courses.[1375] Know<br>that Jiva becomes freed from the hell (of acts) as represented by heaven<br>or godship. After the same manner, Jiva gets, off from the other births<br>(corresponding with the other colours). Jiva sports for many long Kalpas<br>in the world of Devas. Falling thence, he once more obtains the status of<br>Humanity. He then stays in that condition for the space of a hundred and<br>eight Kalpas. He then attains once more to the status of a Deva. If while<br>in the status of humanity (for the second time) he falleth through (evil<br>acts as represented by) Kala (in the form of Kali), he then sinks into<br>the Dark colour and thus occupies the very lowest of all stages of<br>existence.<br><br>"I shall tell thee now, O foremost of Asuras, how Jiva succeeds in<br>effecting his Emancipation. Desirous of Emancipation, Jiva, relying upon<br>seven hundred kinds of acts every one of which is characterised by a<br>predominance of the attribute of Sattwa, gradually courses through Red<br>and Yellow and at last attains to White. Arrived here, Jiva travels<br>through several regions that are most adorable and that have the Eight<br>well-known regions of felicity beneath them, and all the while pursues<br>that stainless and effulgent form of existence which is Emancipation's<br>self.[1376] Know that the Eight (already referred to and) which are<br>identical with the Sixty (subdivided into) hundreds, are, unto those that<br>are highly effulgent, only creations of the mind (without having any real<br>or independent existence). The highest object of acquisition with one<br>that is White of hue, is that condition (called Turiya) which transcends<br>the three other states of consciousness, viz., Wakefulness and Dream and<br>Dreamless slumber.[1377] As regards that Yogin who is unable to abandon<br>the felicities that Yoga-puissance brings about, he has to dwell (in one<br>and the same body) for one century of Kalpas in auspiciousness and after<br>that in four other regions (called Mahar, Jana, Tapas, and Satya). Even<br>that is the highest end of one belonging to the sixth colour, and who is<br>Unsuccessful though crowned with success, and who has transcended all<br>attachments and passions.[1378] That Yogin, again, who falls off from<br>Yoga practices after having attained the measure of eminence described<br>already resides in heaven for a century of Kalpas with the, unexhausted<br>remnant of his past acts (to be exhausted by enjoyment or endurance as<br>the case may be), and with the seven (viz., the five senses of knowledge<br>and mind and understanding) purged of all stains in consequence of their<br>predisposition or proneness towards the attribute of Sattwa. And the<br>expiry of that period, such a person has to come to the world of men<br>where he attains to great eminence.[1379] Turning back from the world of<br>men, he departs for attaining to new forms of existence that run higher<br>and higher in the upward scale. While engaged in this, he courseth<br>through seven regions for seven times, his puissance being always<br>increased in consequence of his Samadhi and the re-awakening from<br>it.[1380] The Yogin who is desirous of final Emancipation suppresses by<br>Yoga-knowledge the seven, and continues to dwell in the world of life,<br>freed from attachments; and taking those seven for certain means of<br>grief, he casts them off and attains afterwards to that state which is<br>Indestructible and Infinite. Some say that that is the region of<br>Mahadeva; some, of Vishnu; some, of Brahman; some, of Sesha; some, of<br>Nara; some, of the effulgent Chit; and some, of the All-pervading.[1381]<br>When universal destruction comes, those persons who have succeeded in<br>completely consuming by Knowledge their gross and subtle and karana<br>bodies, always enter into Brahma. All their Senses also which have action<br>for their essence and which are not identical with Brahma, merge into the<br>same. When the time of universal destruction comes, those Jivas who have<br>attained to the position of Devas and who have an unexhausted remnant of<br>the fruits of acts to enjoy or endure, revert to those stages of life in<br>the subsequent Kalpa which had been theirs in the previous one. This is<br>due to the similarity of every successive Kalpa to every previous one.<br>Those again whose acts, at the time of universal destruction, have been<br>exhausted by enjoyment or endurance in respect of their fruits, falling<br>down from heaven, take birth among men, in the subsequent Kalpa, for<br>without Knowledge one cannot destroy one's acts in even a hundred Kalpas.<br>All superior Beings again, endued with similar powers and similar forms,<br>revert to their respective destinies at a new creation after a universal<br>destruction, ascending and descending precisely in the same manner as<br>during the creation that is dissolved.[1382] As regards, again, the<br>person who is conversant with Brahma, as long as he continues to enjoy<br>and endure the unexhausted remnant of his acts of previous Kalpas, it is<br>said that all creatures and the two stainless sciences live in his body.<br>When his Chitta becomes cleansed by Yoga, and when he practises Samyama,<br>this perceptible universe appears to him as only his own fivefold<br>senses.[1383] Enquiring with a cleansed mind, Jiva attains to a high and<br>stainless end. Thence he attains to a spot which knows no deterioration,<br>and thence attains to eternal Brahma that is so difficult of<br>acquisition.[1384] Thus, Of thou of great might, I have discoursed to<br>thee of the eminence of Narayana!'<br><br>"Vritra said, 'These words of thine, I see, perfectly according with the<br>truth. Indeed, when this is so, I have no (cause of grief). Having<br>listened to thy words, O thou of great powers of mind, I have become<br>freed from sorrow and sin of every kind. O illustrious Rishi, O holy one,<br>I see this wheel of Time, endued with mighty energy, of the most<br>effulgent and Infinite Vishnu, has been set in motion. Eternal is that<br>station, from which all kinds of creation spring. That Vishnu is the<br>Supreme Soul. He is the foremost of Beings. In Him this entire universe<br>rests.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Having said these words, O son of Kunti, Vritra cast<br>off his life-breaths, uniting his soul (in Yoga, with the supreme Soul),<br>and attained to the highest station.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, whether this Janardana<br>(Krishna) is that illustrious and puissant Lord of whom Sanatkumara spoke<br>unto Vritra in days of old.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The Highest Deity, endued with the six attributes of<br>(puissance, etc.) is at the Root. Staying there, the Supreme Soul, with<br>his own energy, creates all these diverse existent things.[1385] Know<br>that this Kesava who knows no deterioration is from His eighth portion.<br>Endued with the highest Intelligence, it is this Kesava who creates the<br>three worlds with an eighth portion (of His energy). Coming immediately<br>after Him who lies at the Root, this Kesava who is eternal (compared with<br>all other existent things), changes at the end of each Kalpa. He,<br>however, who lies at the Root and who is endued with supreme might and<br>puissance, lies in the waters when universal destruction comes (in the<br>form of the potential Seed of all things). Kesava is that Creator of pure<br>Soul who courseth through all the eternal worlds.[1386] Infinite and<br>Eternal as He is, He fills all space (with emanations from Himself) and<br>courseth through the universe (in the form of everything that constitutes<br>the universe). Freed as He is from limitations of every kind such as the<br>possession of attributes would imply, he suffers himself to be invested<br>with Avidya and awakened to Consciousness, Kesava of Supreme Soul creates<br>all things. In Him rests this wondrous universe in its entirety.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O thou that art conversant with the highest object<br>of knowledge, I think that Vritra saw beforehand the excellent end that<br>awaited him. It is for this, O grandsire, that he was happy and did not<br>yield to grief (in view of his coming Death). He who is White of hue, who<br>has taken birth in a pure or stainless race, and who has attained to the<br>rank of a Sadhya, doth not, O sinless one, come back (into the world for<br>re-birth). Such a person, O grandsire, is freed from both hell and the<br>status of all intermediate creatures. He, however, who has attained to<br>either the Yellow or the Red hue, is seen sometimes to be overwhelmed by<br>Tamas and fall among the order of Intermediate creatures. As regards<br>ourselves, we are exceedingly afflicted and attached to objects that are<br>productive of sorrow or indifference or joy. Alas, what will the end be<br>to which we shall attain? Will it be the Blue or the Dark which is the<br>lowest of all hues?'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Ye are Pandavas. Ye have been born in a stainless<br>race. Ye are of rigid vows. Having sported in joy in the regions of the<br>gods, ye shall come back to the world of men. Living happily as long as<br>the creation lasts, all of you at the next new creation will be admitted<br>among the gods, and enjoying all kinds of felicities ye will at last be<br>numbered among the Siddhas. Let no fear be yours. Be you cheerful.'"
