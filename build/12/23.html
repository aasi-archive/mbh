                            Vaisampayana said, "Thus addressed by Arjuna of curly hair, the Kuru king<br>born of Kunti remained speechless. Then the island-born (Vyasa) said<br>these words.<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'The words of Arjuna, O amiable Yudhishthira, are true. The<br>highest religion, as declared by the scriptures, depends on the duties of<br>domesticity. Thou art acquainted with all duties. Do thou then duly<br>practise the duties prescribed for thee (viz., the duties of<br>domesticity). A life of retirement in the woods, casting off the duties<br>of domesticity, has not been laid down for thee. The gods, Pitris,<br>guests, and servants, all depend (for their sustenance) upon the person<br>leading a life of domesticity. Do thou then support all these, O lord of<br>the earth! Birds and animals and various other creatures, O ruler of men,<br>are supported by men leading domestic lives. He, therefore, that belongs<br>to that mode of life is superior (to all others). A life of domesticity<br>is the most difficult of all the four modes of life. Do thou practise<br>that mode of life then, O Partha, which is difficult of being practised<br>by persons of unrestrained sense. Thou hast a good knowledge of all the<br>Vedas. Thou hast earned great ascetic merit. It behoveth thee, therefore,<br>to bear like an ox the burthen of thy ancestral kingdom. Penances,<br>sacrifices, forgiveness, learning, mendicancy, keeping the senses under<br>control, contemplation, living in solitude, contentment, and knowledge<br>(of Brahma), should, O king, be striven after by Brahmanas to the best of<br>their ability for the attainment of success. I shall now tell thee the<br>duties of Kshatriyas. They are not unknown to thee. Sacrifice, learning,<br>exertion, ambition,[69] wielding 'the rod of punishment,' fierceness,<br>protection of subjects., knowledge of the Vedas, practise of all kinds of<br>penances, goodness of conduct, acquisition of wealth, and gifts to<br>deserving persons,&#8212;these, O king, well performed and acquired by persons<br>of the royal order, secure for them both this world and the next, as<br>heard by us. Amongst these, O son of Kunti, wielding the rod of<br>chastisement has been said to be the foremost. Strength must always<br>reside in a Kshatriya, and upon strength depends chastisement. Those<br>duties that I have mentioned are, O king, the principal ones for<br>Kshatriyas and contribute greatly to their success. Vrihaspati, in this<br>connection, sang this verse: 'Like a snake devouring a mouse, the Earth<br>devours a king that is inclined to peace and a Brahmana that is<br>exceedingly attached to a life of domesticity.' It is heard again that<br>the royal sage Sudyumna, only by wielding the rod of chastisement,<br>obtained the highest success, like Daksha himself, the son of Prachetas.'<br><br>Yudhishthira said, 'O holy one, by what acts did Sudyumna, that lord of<br>the earth, obtain the highest success? I desire to hear the history of<br>that king!'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'In this connection is cited this old history. There were<br>two brothers, viz., Sankha and Likhita, of rigid vows. The two brothers<br>had two separate dwellings both of which were beautiful. Situate by the<br>bank of the stream called Vahuda, both of those residences were adorned<br>with trees that were always burthened with flowers and fruits. Once on a<br>time Likhita came to the residence of his brother Sankha. At that time,<br>however, Sankha had gone out of his asylum on no fixed purpose. Arrived<br>at the asylum of his brother, Likhita plucked many ripe fruits. Obtaining<br>them the regenerate Likhita began to eat them without any qualms of<br>conscience. While still employed in the act of eating, Sankha came back<br>to his retreat. Beholding him eating, Sankha addressed his brother,<br>saying, 'Whence have these fruits been obtained and for what reason art<br>thou eating them?' Approaching his elder brother and saluting him,<br>Likhita smilingly replied, saying, 'I have taken them even from this<br>retreat.' Filled with great rage, Sankha said unto him, 'Thou hast<br>committed theft by thyself taking these fruits. Go and approaching the<br>king confess to him what thou hast done. Tell him, O best of kings, I<br>have committed the offence of approaching what was not given to me.<br>Knowing me for a thief and observing the duty of thy order, do thou soon<br>inflict upon me, O ruler of men, the punishment of a thief.' Thus<br>addressed, the highly blessed Likhita of rigid vows, at the command of<br>his brother, proceeded to king Sudyumna. Hearing from his gate-keepers<br>that Likhita had come, king Sudyumna, with his counsellors, advanced (for<br>receiving the sage). Meeting him, the king addressed that foremost of all<br>persons conversant with duties, saying, 'Tell me, O revered one, the<br>reason of thy coming. Regard it as already accomplished.' Thus<br>questioned, that regenerate sage said unto Sudyumna, 'Do thou promise<br>first that thou wilt achieve it. It will then behove thee, after hearing<br>me, to accomplish that promise. O bull among men, I ate some fruits that<br>had not been given me by my elder brother. Do thou, O monarch, punish me<br>for it without delay.' Sudyumna answered, 'If the king be regarded as<br>competent to wield the rod of chastisement, he should be regarded, O bull<br>among Brahmanas, as equally competent to pardon. Purified in respect of<br>thy act, O thou of high vows, consider thyself as pardoned. Tell me now<br>what other wishes thou hast. I shall certainly accomplish those commands<br>of thine!'<br><br>"Vyasa continued, 'Thus honoured by the high-souled king, the regenerate<br>sage Likhita, however, did not solicit him for any other favour. Then<br>that ruler of the earth caused the two hands of the high-souled Likhita<br>to be cut off, whereupon the latter, bearing the punishment, went away.<br>Returning to his brother Sankha, Likhita, in great affection, said, 'It<br>behoveth thee now to pardon this wretch that hath been duly punished (for<br>what he did).' Sankha said, I am not angry with thee, nor hast thou<br>injured me, O foremost of all persons conversant with duties. Thy virtue,<br>however, had suffered a shock. I have rescued thee from that plight.<br>Proceed without delay to the river Vahuda and gratify duly, with<br>oblations of water, the gods, Rishis and the Pitris, and never again set<br>thy heart on sin.' Hearing these words of Sankha, Likhita performed his<br>ablutions in the sacred stream and set about for commencing the<br>water-rite. Upon this, two hands, resembling two lotuses, appeared at the<br>extremities of his stumps. Filled with wonder he came back to his brother<br>and showed him the two hands. Sankha said unto him, 'All this has been<br>accomplished by me through my penances. Do not be surprised at it.<br>Providence hath been the instrument here.' Likhita answered, 'O thou of<br>great splendour, why didst thou not purify me at first, when, O best of<br>regenerate ones, such was the energy of thy penances?' Sankha, said, 'I<br>should not have acted otherwise. I am not thy chastiser. The ruler (who<br>has punished thee) has been himself purified, as also thyself, along with<br>the Pitris!'<br><br>"Vyasa continued, 'That king, O eldest son of Pandu, became eminent by<br>this act and obtained the highest success like the lord Daksha himself!<br>Even this is the duty of Kshatriyas, viz., the ruling of subjects. Any<br>other, O monarch, would be regarded as a wrong path for them. Do not give<br>way to grief. O best of all persons conversant with duty, listen to the<br>beneficial words of this thy brother. Wielding the rod of chastisement, O<br>king, is the duty of kings and not the shaving of the head.'"
