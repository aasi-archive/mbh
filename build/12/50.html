                            "Vasudeva said, 'Listen, O son of Kunti, to the story of Rama's energy<br>and powers and birth as heard by me from great Rishis discoursing upon<br>the subject. Listen to the story of how millions of Kshatriyas were slain<br>by Jamadagni's son and how those that sprung again in the diverse royal.<br>races in Bharata were again slaughtered. Jadu had a son named Rajas.<br>Rajas had a son named Valakaswa. King Valakaswa had a son named Kusika of<br>righteous behaviour. Resembling the thousand-eyed Indra on earth, Kusika<br>underwent the austerest of penances from desire of attaining the chief of<br>the three worlds for a son. Beholding him engaged in the austerest of<br>penances and competent to beget a son, the thousand-eyed Purandara<br>himself inspired the king (with his force). The great lord of the three<br>worlds, the chastiser of Paka, O king, then became Kusika's son known by<br>the name of Gadhi. Gadhi had a daughter, O monarch, of the name of<br>Satyavati. The puissant Gadhi gave her (for wife) unto Richika, a<br>descendant of Bhrigu. Her lord of Bhrigu's race, O delighter of the<br>Kurus, became highly gratified with her for the purity of her behaviour.<br>He cooked the sacrificial food consisting of milk and rice for giving<br>unto Gadhi (her sire) a son. Calling his wife, Richika of Bhrigu's race<br>said, 'This portion of the sanctified food should be taken by thee, and<br>this (other) portion by thy mother. A son will be born of her that will<br>blaze with energy and be a bull among Kshatriyas. Invincible by<br>Kshatriyas on earth, he will be the slayer of the foremost of Kshatriyas.<br>As regards thee, O blessed lady, this portion of the food will give thee<br>a son of great wisdom, an embodiment of tranquillity, endued with ascetic<br>penances, and the foremost of Brahmanas. Having said these words unto his<br>wife, the blessed Richika of Bhrigu's race, setting his heart on<br>penances, proceeded to the woods. About this time, king Gadhi, resolved<br>upon a pilgrimage to the holy waters, arrived with his queen at the<br>retreat, of Richika. Satyavati, upon this, O king, taking the two<br>portions of the sanctified food, cheerfully and in great haste,<br>represented the worlds of her lord unto her mother. The queen-mother, O<br>son of Kunti, gave the portion intended for herself unto her daughter,<br>and herself took from ignorance the portion intended for the latter. Upon<br>this, Satyavati, her body blazing with lustre, conceived a child of<br>terrible form intended to become the exterminator of the Kshatriyas.<br>Beholding a Brahmana child lying within her womb, that tiger among the<br>Bhrigus said unto his wife of celestial beauty these words: 'Thou hast<br>been deceived by the, mother, O blessed lady, in consequence of the<br>substitution of the sanctified morsels. Thy son will become a person of<br>cruel deeds and vindictive heart. Thy brother again (born of thy mother)<br>will be a Brahmana devoted to ascetic penances. Into the sanctified food<br>intended for thee had been placed the seed of the supreme and universal<br>Brahma, while into that intended for thy mother had been placed the sum<br>total of Kshatriya energy. In consequence, however, of the substitution<br>of the two portions, O blessed lady, that which had been intended will<br>not happen. Thy mother will obtain a Brahmana child while thou wilt<br>obtain a son that will become a Kshatriya.' Thus addressed by her lord,<br>the highly blessed Satyavati prostrated herself and placing her head at<br>his feet, trembling, said, 'It behoveth thee not, O holy one, to speak<br>such words unto me, viz., 'Thou shalt obtain a wretch among Brahmanas<br>(for thy son).'<br><br>"Richika said, 'This was not intended by me, O blessed lady, in respect<br>of thee. A son of fierce deeds has been conceived by thee simply in<br>consequence of the substitution of the sanctified morsels.'<br><br>"Satyavati replied saying, 'If thou wishest, O sage, thou canst create<br>other worlds, what need then be said of a child? It behoveth thee, O<br>puissant one, to give me a son that shall be righteous and devoted to<br>peace.'<br><br>"Richika said, 'Never was falsehood spoken by me before, O blessed lady,<br>even in jest. What need then be said of (such a solemn occasion as)<br>preparing sanctified food with the aid of Vedic formulae after igniting<br>t. fire? It was ordained of yore by Destiny, O amiable one! I have<br>ascertained it all by my penances. All the descendants of thy father will<br>be possessed of Brahmanic virtues.'<br><br>"Satyavati said, 'O puissant one, let our grandson be such, but, O<br>foremost of ascetics, let me have a son of tranquil pursuits.'<br><br>"Richika said, 'O thou of the fairest complexion, there is no<br>distinction, I conceive, between a son and a grandson. It will be, O<br>amiable one, as thou sayest.'<br><br>"Vasudeva continued, 'Then Satyavati brought forth a son in Bhrigu's race<br>who was devoted to penances and characterised by tranquil pursuits, viz.,<br>Jamadagni of regulated vows. Kusika's son Gadhi begot a son named<br>Viswamitra. Possessed of every attribute of a Brahmana, that son (though<br>born in the Kshatriya order) was equal to a Brahmana. Richika (thus)<br>begot Jamadagni, that ocean of penances. Jamadagni begot a son of fierce<br>deeds. The foremost of men, that son mastered the sciences, including the<br>science of arms. Like unto a blazing fire, that son was Rama, the<br>exterminator of the Kshatriyas. Having gratified Mahadeva on the<br>mountains of Gandhamadana, he begged weapons of that great god,<br>especially the axe of fierce energy in his hands. In consequence of that<br>unrivalled axe of fiery splendour and irresistible sharpness, he became<br>unrivalled on earth. Meanwhile the mighty son of Kritavirya, viz., Arjuna<br>of the Kshatriya order and ruler of the Haihayas, endued with great<br>energy, highly virtuous in behaviour, and possessed of a thousand arms<br>through the grace of (the great Rishi) Dattatreya, having subjugated in<br>battle, by the might of his own arms, the whole earth with her mountains<br>and seven islands, became a very powerful emperor and (at last) gave away<br>the earth unto the Brahmanas in a horse-sacrifice. On a certain occasion,<br>solicited by the thirsty god of fire, O son of Kunti, the thousand-armed<br>monarch of great prowess gave alms unto that deity. Springing from the<br>point of his shafts, the god of fire, possessed of great energy, desirous<br>of consuming (what was offered), burnt villages and towns and kingdoms<br>and hamlets of cowherds. Through the prowess of that foremost of men,<br>viz., Kritavirya of great energy, the god of fire burnt mountains and<br>great forests. Assisted by the king of the Haihayas, the god of fire,<br>caused by the wind to blaze forth with energy consumed the uninhabited<br>but delightful retreat of the high-souled Apava. Possessed of great<br>energy, Apava, O mighty-armed king, seeing his retreat consumed by the<br>powerful Kshatriya, cursed that monarch in wrath, saying, 'Since, O<br>Arjuna, without excepting these my specious woods, thou hast burnt them,<br>therefore, Rama (of Bhrigu's race) will lop off thy (thousand) arm. The<br>mighty Arjuna, however, of great prowess, always devoted to peace, ever<br>regardful of Brahmanas and disposed to grant protection (unto all class),<br>and charitable and brave, O Bharata, did not think of that curse<br>denounced on him by that high-souled Rishis. His powerful sons, always<br>haughty and cruel, in consequence of that course, became the indirect<br>cause of his death. The princes, O bull of Bharata's race, seize and<br>brought away the calf of Jamadagni's homa cow, without the knowledge of<br>Kritavirya, the ruler of the Haihayas. For this reason a dispute took<br>place between the high-souled Jamadagni (and the Haihayas). The puissant<br>Rama, the son of Jamadagni, filled with wrath, lopped off the arms of<br>Arjuna and brought back, O monarch, his sire's calf which was wandering<br>within the inner enclosures of the king's palace. Then the foolish son of<br>Arjuna, repairing together to the retreat of the high-souled Jamadagni,<br>felled with the points of their lances, O king, the head of the Rishi<br>from off his trunk while the celebrated Rama was out for fetching sacred<br>fuel and grass. Inflamed with wrath at the death of his father and<br>inspired with vengeance, Rama vowed to free the earth of Kshatriyas and<br>took up arms. Then that tiger among the Bhrigus, possessed of great<br>energy, putting forth his prowess, speedily slaughtered all the sons and<br>grandsons of Kritavirya. Slaughtering thousands of Haihayas in rage, the<br>descendent of Bhrigu, O king, made the earth miry with blood. Possessed<br>of great energy, he quickly reft the earth of all Kshatriyas. Filled then<br>with compassion, he retired into the woods. Afterwards, when some<br>thousands of years had passed away, the puissant Rama, who was wrathful<br>by nature, had imputations cast upon him (of cowardice). The grandson of<br>Viswamitra and son of Raivya, possessed of great ascetic merit, named<br>Paravasu, O monarch, began to cast imputations on Rama in public, saying,<br>'O Rama, were not those righteous men, viz., Pratardana and others, who<br>were assembled at a sacrifice at the time of Yayati's fall, Kshatriyas by<br>birth? Thou art not of true vows, O Rama! Thine is an empty boast among<br>people. Through fear of Kshatriya heroes thou hast betaken thyself to the<br>mountains. The descendant of Bhrigu, hearing these words of Paravasu,<br>once more took up arms and once more strewed the earth with hundreds of<br>Kshatriya bodies. Those Kshatriyas, however, O king, counting by<br>hundreds, that were spared by Rama, multiplied (in time) and became<br>mighty monarchs on earth. Rama once more slaughtered them quickly, not<br>sparing the very children, O king! Indeed, the earth became once more<br>strewn with the bodies of Kshatriya children of premature birth. As soon<br>as Kshatriya children were born, Rama slaughtered them. Some Kshatriya<br>ladies, however, succeeded in protecting their children (from Rama's<br>wrath). Having made the earth destitute of Kshatriyas for thrice seven<br>times, the puissant Bhargava, at the completion of a horse-sacrifice,<br>gave away the earth as sacrificial present unto Kasyapa. For preserving<br>the remnant of the Kshatriyas, Kasyapa, O king, pointing with his hand<br>that still held the sacrificial ladle, said these words, O great sage,<br>repair to the shores of the southern ocean. It behoveth thee not, O Rama,<br>to reside within (what is) my dominion.' At these words, Ocean suddenly<br>created for Jamadagni's son, on his other shore, a region called<br>Surparaka. Kasyapa also, O monarch, having accepted the earth in gift,<br>and made a present of it unto the Brahmanas, entered the great forest.<br>Then Sudras and Vaisyas, acting most wilfully, began to unite themselves,<br>O bull of Bharata's race, with the wives of Brahmanas. When anarchy sets<br>in on earth, the weak are oppressed by the strong, and no man is master<br>of his own property. Unprotected duly by Kshatriyas observant of virtue,<br>and oppressed by the wicked in consequence of that disorder, the earth<br>quickly sank to the lowest depths. Beholding the earth sinking from fear,<br>the high-souled Kasyapa held her on his lap; and since the great Rishi<br>held her on his lap (uru) therefore is the earth known by the name of<br>Urvi. The goddess earth, for protection's sake, gratified Kasyapa and<br>begged of him a king.<br><br>"The Earth said, 'There are, O, regenerate one, some foremost of<br>Kshatriyas concealed by me among women. They were born in the race of<br>Haihayas. Let them, O sage, protect me. There is another person of Puru's<br>race, viz., Viduratha's son, O puissant one, who has been brought up<br>among bears in the Rikshavat mountains. Another, viz., the son of<br>Saudasa, has been protected, through compassion, by Parasara of<br>immeasurable energy and ever engaged in sacrifices. Though born in one of<br>the regenerate orders, yet like a Sudra he does everything for that Rishi<br>and has, therefore, been named Sarvakarman (servant of all work). Sivi's<br>son of great energy, viz., Gopati by name, has been brought up in the<br>forest among kine. Let him, O sage, protect me. Pratardana's son, named<br>Vatsa of great might, has been brought up among calves in a cowpen. Let<br>that one of the royal order protect me. Dadhivahana's grandson and<br>Diviratha's son was concealed and protected on the banks of Ganga by the<br>sage Gautama. His name is Vrihadratha. Possessed of great energy and<br>adorned with numerous blessed qualities, that blessed prince has been<br>protected by wolves and the mountains of Gridhrakuta. Many Kshatriyas<br>belonging to the race of Maratta have been protected. Equal unto the lord<br>of Maruts in energy, they have been brought up by Ocean. These children<br>of the Kshatriya order have been heard of as existing in different<br>places. They are living among artisans and goldsmiths. If they protect me<br>I shall then stay unmoved. Their sires and grandsires have been slain for<br>my sake by Rama Of great prowess. It is my duty, O great sage, to see<br>that their funeral rites are duly performed. I do not desire that I<br>should be protected by my present rulers. Do thou, O sage, speedily make<br>such arrangements that I may exist (as before).'<br><br>"Vasudeva continued, 'The sage Kasyapa then, seeking out those Kshatriyas<br>of great energy whom the goddess had indicated, installed them duly as<br>kings (for protecting her). Those Kshatriya races that are now extent are<br>the progeny of those princes. That which thou hast questioned me, O son<br>of Panda, happened in days of yore even thus.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Conversing thus with Yudhishthira, that<br>foremost of righteous persons, the high-souled Yadava hero proceeded<br>quickly on that car, illumining all the points of the compass like the<br>divine Surya himself.'"
