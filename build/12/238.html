                            "Vyasa said, 'These, then, are the obligatory acts ordained for<br>Brahmanas. One possessed of knowledge always attains to success by going<br>through (the prescribed) acts. If no doubt arises in respect of acts,<br>then acts done are sure to lead to success. The doubt to which we refer<br>is this: whether acts are obligatory or whether they are optional.[936]<br>As regards this (doubt about the true character of acts, it should be<br>said that), if acts are ordained for man for inducing knowledge (by which<br>alone Brahma or Emancipation is to be attained, even then) they should be<br>regarded as obligatory (and not optional). I shall now discourse on them<br>by the light of inferences and experience. Listen to me.[937] With<br>respect to acts some men say that Exertion is their cause. Others say<br>that Necessity is their cause. Others, again, maintain that Nature is the<br>cause. Some say that acts are the result of both Exertion and Necessity.<br>Some maintain that acts flow from Time, Exertion, and Nature. Some say<br>that of the three (viz., Exertion, Necessity, and Nature), one only (and<br>not the other two) is the cause. Some are of opinion that all the three<br>combined are the cause.[938] Some persons that are engaged in the<br>performance of acts say, with respect to all objects, that they exist,<br>that they do not exist, that they cannot be said to exist, that they<br>cannot be said not to exist, that it is not that they cannot be said to<br>exist, and lastly, that it is not that they cannot be said not to exist.<br>(These then are the diverse views entertained by men). They, however,<br>that are Yogins, behold Brahma to be the universal cause. The men of the<br>Treta, the Dwapara, and the Kali Yugas are inspired with doubts. The men,<br>however, of the Krita Yuga are devoted to penances, possessed of tranquil<br>souls, and observant of righteousness.[939] In that age all men regard<br>the Richs, the Samans, and the Yajuses as identical not withstanding<br>their apparent diversity. Analysing desire and aversion, they worship<br>only penance.[940] Devoted to the practice of penances, steadfast in<br>them, and rigid in their observance, one obtains the fruition of all<br>desires by penances alone. By penance one attains to that by becoming<br>which one creates the universe. By penance one becomes that in<br>consequence of which one becomes the puissant master of all things.[941]<br>That Brahma has been expounded in the declarations of the Vedas. For all<br>that, Brahma is inconceivable by even those that are conversant with<br>those declarations. Once more has Brahma been declared in the Vedanta.<br>Brahma, however, cannot be beheld by means of acts.[942] The sacrifice<br>ordained for Brahmans consists in japa (meditation and recitation), that<br>for Kshatriyas consists in the slaughter of (clean) animals for the<br>gratification of the deities; that for Vaisyas consists in the production<br>of crops and, the keep of domestic animals; and that for Sudras in menial<br>service of the: three other orders. By observing the duties laid down for<br>him and by studying the Vedas and other scriptures, one becomes a Dwija<br>(regenerate). Whether one does any other act or not, one becomes a<br>Brahmana by becoming the friend of all creatures.[943] In the beginning<br>of Treta, the Vedas and sacrifices and the divisions of caste and the<br>several modes of life existed in, their entirety. In consequence,<br>however, of the duration of life being decreased in Dwapara, those are<br>overtaken by decline. In the Dwapara age as also in the Kali, the Vedas<br>are overtaken by perplexity. Towards the close of Kali again, it is<br>doubtful if they ever become even visible to the eye.[944] In that age,<br>the duties of the respective order disappear, and men become afflicted by<br>iniquity. The juicy attributes of kine, of the earth, of water, and<br>(medicinal and edible) herbs, disappear.[945] Through (universal)<br>iniquity the Vedas disappear and with them all the duties inculcated in<br>them as also the duties in respect of the four modes of life. They who<br>remain observant of the duties of their own order become afflicted, and<br>all mobile and immobile objects undergo a change for the worse.[946] As<br>the showers of heaven cause all products of the earth to grow, after the<br>same manner the Vedas, in every age, cause all the angas to grow.[947]<br>Without doubt, Time assumes diverse shapes. It has neither beginning nor<br>end. It is Time which produces all creatures and again devours them. I<br>have already spoken of it to thee. Time is the origin of all creatures;<br>Time is that which makes them grow; Time is that which is their<br>destroyer; and lastly it is time that is their ruler. Subject to pairs of<br>opposites (such as heat and cold, pleasure and pain, etc.), creatures of<br>infinite variety rest on Time according to their own natures (without<br>being otherwise than how they have been ordained by supreme Brahma).'[948]
