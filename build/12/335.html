                            "Yudhishthira said, 'If a man be a house-holder or a Brahmacharin, a<br>forest-recluse or a mendicant, and if he desires to achieve success, what<br>deity should he adore? How can he certainly acquire heaven and attain<br>that which is of the highest benefit (viz., Emancipation)? According to<br>what ordinances should he perform the homa in honour of the gods and the<br>Pitris? What is the region to which one goes when one becomes<br>emancipated? What is the essence of Emancipation? What should one do so<br>that one, having attained to heaven, would not have to fall down thence?<br>Who is the deity of the deities? And who is the Pitri of the Pitris? Who<br>is he that is superior to him, who is the deity of the deities and the<br>Pitri of the Pitris? Tell me all this, O Grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, O thou that art well acquainted with the art of<br>questioning, this question that thou hast asked me, O sinless one, is one<br>that touches a deep mystery. One cannot answer it with the aid of the<br>science of argumentation, even if one were to strive for a hundred years.<br>Without the grace of Narayana, O king, or an accession of high knowledge,<br>this question of thine is incapable of being answered. Connected though<br>this topic be with a deep mystery, I shall yet, O slayer of foes, expound<br>it to thee![1790] In this connection is cited the old history of the<br>discourse between Narada and the Rishi Narayana. I heard it from my sire<br>that in the Krita age, O monarch, during the epoch of the Self-born Manu,<br>the eternal Narayana, the Soul of the universe, took birth as the son of<br>Dharma in a quadruple form, viz., as Nara, Narayana, Hari, and the<br>Self-create Krishna.[1791] Amongst them all, Narayana and Nara underwent<br>the severest austerities by repairing to the Himalayan retreat known by<br>the name of Vadari, by riding on their golden ears. Each of those cars<br>was furnished with eight wheels, and made up of the five primal elements,<br>and looked exceedingly beautiful.[1792] Those original regents of the<br>world who had taken birth as the sons of Dharma, became exceedingly<br>emaciated in person in consequence of the austerities they had undergone.<br>Indeed, for those austerities and for their energy, the very deities were<br>unable to look at them. Only that deity with whom they were propitiated<br>could behold them. Without doubt, with his heart devoted to them, and<br>impelled by a longing desire to be-hold them, Narada dropped down on<br>Gandhamadana from a summit of the high mountains of Meru and wandered<br>over all the world. Possessed of great speed, he at last repaired to that<br>spot whereon was situated the retreat of Vadari. Impelled by curiosity he<br>entered that retreat at the hour of Nara's and Narayana's, performing<br>their daily rites. He said unto himself.&#8212;This is truly the retreat of<br>that Being in whom are established all the worlds including the deities,<br>the Asuras, the Gandharvas, the Kinnaras, and the great snakes! There was<br>only one form of this great Being before. That form took birth in four<br>shapes for the expansion of the race of Dharma which have been reared by<br>that deity. How wonderful it is that Dharma has thus been honoured by<br>these four great deities viz., Nara, Narayana, and Hari and Krishna! In<br>this spot Krishna and Hari dwelt formerly. The other two, however, viz.,<br>Nara and Narayana, are now dwelling here engaged in penances for the<br>object of enhancing their merit. These two are the highest refuge of the<br>universe. What can be the nature of the daily rites these two perform?<br>They are the sires of all creatures, and the illustrious deities of all<br>beings. Endued with high intelligence, what is that deity whom these two<br>worship? Who are those Pitris whom these two Pitris of all beings<br>adore?&#8212;Thinking of this in his mind, and filled with devotion towards<br>Narayana, Narada suddenly appeared before those two gods. After those two<br>deities had finished their adoration to _their_ deities and the Rishis,<br>they looked at the celestial Rishi arrived at their retreat. The latter<br>was honoured with those eternal rites that are ordained in the<br>scriptures. Beholding that extraordinary conduct of the two original<br>deities in themselves worshipping other deities and Pitris, the<br>illustrious Rishi Narada took his seat there, well pleased with the<br>honours he had received. With a cheerful soul he cast his eyes then on<br>Narayana, and bowing unto Mahadeva he said these words.<br><br>"Narada said, In the Vedas and the Puranas, in the Angas and the<br>subsidiary Angas thou art sung with reverence, thou art unborn and<br>eternal. Thou art the Creator. Thou art the mother of the universe. Thou<br>art the embodiment of Immortality and thou art the foremost of all<br>things. The Past and the Future, indeed, the entire universe has been<br>established on thee! The four modes of life, O lord, having the domestic<br>for their first, ceaselessly sacrifice to thee that art of diverse forms.<br>Thou art the father and the mother and the eternal preceptor of the<br>universe. We know not who is that deity or that Pitri unto whom thou art<br>sacrificing to-day!<br><br>"The holy one said, This topic is one about which nothing should be said.<br>It is an ancient mystery. Thy devotion to me is very great. Hence, O<br>regenerate one, I shall discourse to thee on it agreeably to the truth.<br>That which is minute, which is inconceivable, unmanifest, immobile,<br>durable, destitute of all connection with the senses and the objects of<br>the senses, that which is dissociated from the (five) elements&#8212;that is<br>called the in-dwelling Soul of all existent creatures. That is known by<br>the name of Kshetrajna. Transcending the three attributes of Sattwa,<br>Rajas, and Tamas, that is regarded as Purusha in the scriptures. From Him<br>hath followed the unmanifest, O foremost of regenerate ones, possessed of<br>the three attributes of Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas. Though really<br>unmanifest, she is called indestructible Prakriti and dwell in all<br>manifest forms. Know that She is the source whence we two have sprung.<br>That all-pervading Soul, which is made up of all existent and<br>non-existent things, is adored by us. Even He is what we worship in all<br>those rites that we perform in honour of the deities and the Pitris.<br>There is no higher deity or Pitri than He. O regenerate one, He should be<br>known as our Soul. It is him that we worship. This course of duties<br>followed by men has, O regenerate one, been promulgated by Him. It is His<br>ordinance that we should duly perform all the rites laid down in respect<br>of the deities and the Pitris. Brahman, Sthanu, Manu, Daksha, Bhrigu,<br>Dharma, Yama, Marichi, Angiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Vasishtha,<br>Parameshthi, Vivaswat, Shoma, he that has been called Karddama, Krodha,<br>Avak, and Krita,&#8212;these one and twenty persons, called Prajapatis, were<br>first born. All of them obeyed the eternal law of the Supreme God<br>Observing all the rites, in detail, that were ordained in honour of the<br>deities and the Pitris, all those foremost of regenerate persons acquired<br>all those objects which they sought. The incorporeal denizens of Heaven<br>itself bow to that Supreme deity and through His grace they attain to<br>those fruits and that end which He ordains for them. This is the settled<br>conclusion of the scriptures that these persons freed from these seven<br>and ten attributes, (viz., the five senses of knowledge, the five senses<br>of action, the five vital breaths, and mind and understanding), who have<br>cast off all acts, and are divested of the five and ten elements which<br>constitute the gross body, are said to be Emancipate. That which the<br>Emancipate attain to as their ultimate end is called by the name of<br>Kshetrajna. He is regarded (in the scriptures) as both possessed of and<br>free from all the attributes. He can be apprehended by Knowledge alone.<br>We two have sprung from Him. Knowing him in that way, we adore that<br>eternal Soul of all things. The Vedas and all the modes of life, though<br>characterised by divergences of opinion, all worship Him with devotion.<br>It is He who, speedily moved to grace, confers on them high ends fraught<br>with felicity. Those persons in this world who, filled with His spirit,<br>become fully and conclusively devoted to Him, attain to ends that are<br>much higher, for they succeed in entering Him and becoming merged in his<br>Self. I have now, O Narada, discoursed to thee on what is high mystery<br>moved by the love I bear to thee for thy devotion to me. Indeed, in<br>consequence of that devotion which thou professest towards me, thou hast<br>succeeded in listening to this my discourse!"
