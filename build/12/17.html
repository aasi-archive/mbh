                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Discontent, heedless attachment to earthly goods,<br>the absence of tranquillity, might, folly, vanity, and anxiety,&#8212;affected<br>by these sins, O Bhima, thou covetest sovereignty. Freed from desire,<br>prevailing over joy and grief and attaining to tranquillity, strive thou<br>to be happy. That peerless monarch who will govern this unbounded earth,<br>will have but one stomach. Why dost thou then applaud this course of<br>life? One's desires, O bull of Bharata's race, are incapable of being<br>filled in a day, or in many months. Desire, which is incapable of<br>gratification, cannot, indeed, be fitted in course of one's whole life.<br>Fire, when fed with fuel, blazeth forth; when not so fed, it is<br>extinguished. Do thou, therefore, extinguish with little food the fire in<br>thy stomach when it appears. He that is bereft of wisdom seeks much food<br>for his stomach. Conquer thy stomach first. (Thou shalt then be able to<br>conquer the Earth). The earth being conquered, that which is for thy<br>permanent good will then be won by thee. Thou applaudest desires and<br>enjoyments and prosperity. They, however, that have renounced all<br>enjoyments and reduced their bodies by penances, attain to regions of<br>beatitude. The acquisition and preservation of kingdom is attended with<br>both righteousness and unrighteousness. The desire for them exists in<br>thee. Free thyself, however, from thy great burthens, and adopt<br>renunciation. The tiger, for filling one stomach of his, slaughters many<br>animals. Other animals destitute of strength and moved by covetousness<br>live upon the tiger's prey.[47] If kings, accepting earthly possessions,<br>practise renunciation, they can never have contentment. Behold the loss<br>of understanding that is noticeable in them. As a matter of fact,<br>however, they who subsist on leaves of trees, or use two stones only or<br>their teeth alone for husking their grain, or live upon water only or air<br>alone, succeed in conquering hell.[48] That king who rules this wide<br>unbounded earth, and that person who regards gold and pebbles equally,<br>amongst these two, the latter is said to have attained the object of his<br>life and not the former. Depending, therefore, upon that which is the<br>eternal refuge of joy both here and hereafter, cease thou to act and hope<br>with respect to thy wishes and cease to bear attachment to them. They<br>that have given up desire and enjoyment have never to grieve. Thou,<br>however, grievest for enjoyments.[49] Discarding desire and enjoyment,<br>thou mayst succeed in liberating thyself from false speech.[50] There are<br>two well-known paths (for us), viz., the path of the Pitris and the path<br>of the gods. They that perform sacrifices go by the Pitri-path, while<br>they that are for salvation, go by the god-path.[51] By penances, by<br>Brahmacharya, by study (of the Vedas), the great Rishis, casting off<br>their bodies, proceeded to regions that are above the power of Death.<br>Worldly enjoyments have been styled as bonds, They have also been called<br>Action. Liberated from those two sins (viz., bonds and action), one<br>attains to the highest end. Mention is made of a verse sung (of old) by<br>Janaka who was freed from the pairs of opposites, liberated from desire<br>and enjoyments, and observant of the religion of Moksha. That verse runs<br>thus: 'My treasures are immense, yet I have nothing! If again the whole<br>of Mithila were burnt and reduced to ashes, nothing of mine will be<br>burnt!' As a person on the hill-top looketh down upon men on the plain<br>below, so he that has got up on the top of the mansion of knowledge,<br>seeth people grieving for things that do not call for grief. He, however,<br>that is of foolish understanding, does not see this. He who, casting his<br>eyes on visible things, really seeth them, is said to have eyes and<br>understanding. The faculty called understanding is so called because of<br>the knowledge and comprehension it gives of unknown and incomprehensible<br>things. He who is acquainted with the words of persons that are learned,<br>that are of cleansed souls, and that have attained to a state of Brahma,<br>succeeds in obtaining great honours. When one seeth creatures of infinite<br>diversity to be all one and the same and to be but diversified emanations<br>from the same essence, one is then said to have attained Brahma.[52]<br>Those who reach this high state of culture attain to that supreme and<br>blissful end, and not they who are without knowledge, or they who are of<br>little and narrow souls, or they who are bereft of understanding, or they<br>who are without penances. Indeed, everything rests on the (cultivated)<br>understanding!'"
