                            Vaisampayana said, "Hearing these words of Yajnasena's daughter, Arjuna<br>once more spoke, showing proper regard for his mighty-armed eldest<br>brother of unfading glory.<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'The man armed with the rod of chastisement governs all<br>subjects and protects them. The rod of chastisement is awake when all<br>else is sleep. For this, the wise have characterised the rod of<br>chastisement to be Righteousness itself. The rod of chastisement protects<br>Righteousness and Profit. It protects also, O king! For this, the rod of<br>chastisement is identified with the triple objects of life. Corn and<br>wealth are both protected by the rod of chastisement. Knowing this, O<br>thou that art possessed of learning, take up the rod of chastisement and<br>observe the course of the world. One class of sinful men desist from sin<br>through fear of the rod of chastisement in the king's bands. Another<br>class desist from similar acts through fear of Yama's rod, and yet<br>another from fear of the next world. Another class of persons desist from<br>sinful acts through fear of society. Thus, O king, in this world, whose<br>course is such, everything is, dependent on the rod of chastisement.<br>There is a class of persons who are restrained by only the rod of<br>chastisement from devouring one another. If the rod of chastisement did<br>not protect people, they would have sunk in the darkness of hell. The rod<br>of chastisement (danda) has been so named by the wise because it<br>restrains the ungovernable and punishes the wicked, The chastisement of<br>Brahmanas should be by word of mouth; of Kshatriyas, by giving them only<br>that much of food as would suffice for the support of life; of Vaisyas,<br>by the imposition of fines and forfeitures of property, while for Sudras<br>there is no punishment.[34] For keeping men awake (to their duties) and<br>for the protection of property, ordinances, O king, have been established<br>in the world, under the name of chastisement (or punitive legislation).<br>Thither where chastisement, of dark complexion and red eyes, stands in an<br>attitude of readiness (to grapple with every offender) and the king is of<br>righteous vision, the subjects never forget themselves. The Brahmacharin<br>and the house-holder, the recluse in the forest and the religious<br>mendicant, all these walk in their respective ways through fear of<br>chastisement alone. He that is without any fear, O king, never performs a<br>sacrifice. He that is without fear never giveth away. The man that is<br>without any fear never desires to adhere to any engagement or compact.<br>Without piercing the vitals of others, without achieving the most<br>difficult feats and without staying creatures like a fisherman (slaying<br>fish), no person can obtain great prosperity.[35] Without slaughter, no<br>man has been able to achieve fame in this world or acquire wealth or<br>subjects. Indra himself, by the slaughter of Vritra, became the great<br>Indra. Those amongst the gods that are given to slaughtering others are<br>adored much more by men. Rudra, Skanda, Sakra, Agni, Varuna, are all<br>slaughterers. Kala and Mrityu and Vayu and Kuvera and Surya, the Vasus,<br>the Maruts, the Sadhyas, and the Viswadevas, O Bharata, are all<br>slaughterers. Humbled by their prowess, all people bend to those gods,<br>but not to Brahman or Dhatri or Pushan at any time. Only a few men that<br>are noble of disposition adore in all their acts those among the gods<br>that are equally disposed towards all creatures and that are<br>self-restrained and peaceful. I do not behold the creature in this world<br>that supports life without doing any act of injury to others. Animals<br>live upon animals, the stronger upon the weaker. The mongoose devours<br>mice; the cat devours the mongoose; the dog devours the cat; the dog<br>again is devoured by the spotted leopard. Behold all things again are<br>devoured by the Destroyer when he comes! This mobile and immobile<br>universe is food for living creatures. This has, been ordained by the<br>gods. The man of knowledge, therefore, is never stupefied at it. It<br>behoveth thee, O great king, to become that which thou art by birth.<br>Foolish (Kshatriyas) alone, restraining wrath and joy take refuge in the<br>woods. The very ascetics cannot support their lives without killing<br>creatures. In water, on earth, and fruits, there are innumerable<br>creatures. It is not true that one does not slaughter them. What higher<br>duty is there than supporting one's life?[36] There are many creatures<br>that are so minute that their existence can only be inferred. With the<br>failing of the eyelids alone, they are destroyed. There are men who<br>subduing wrath and pride betake themselves to ascetic courses of life and<br>leaving village and towns repair to the woods. Arrived there, those men<br>may be seen to be so stupefied as to adopt the domestic mode of life once<br>more. Others may be seen, who (in the observance of domesticity) tilling<br>the soil, uprooting herbs, cutting off trees and killing birds and<br>animals, perform sacrifices and at last attain to heaven. O son of Kunti,<br>I have no doubt in this that the acts of all creatures become crowned<br>with success only when the policy of chastisement is properly applied. If<br>chastisement were abolished from the world, creatures wood soon be<br>destroyed. Like fishes in the water, stronger animals prey on the weaker.<br>This truth was formerly spoken by Brahmana himself, viz., that<br>chastisement, properly applied upholds creatures. Behold, the very fires,<br>when extinguished, blaze up again, in fright, when blown. This is due to<br>the fear of force or chastisement. If there were no chastisement in the<br>world distinguishing the good from the bad, then the whole world would<br>have been enveloped in utter darkness and all things would have been<br>confounded. Even they that are breakers of rules, that are atheists and<br>scoffers of the Vedas, afflicted by chastisement, soon become disposed to<br>observe rules and restrictions.[37] Everyone in this world is kept<br>straight by chastisement. A person naturally pure and righteous is<br>scarce. Yielding to the fear of chastisement, man becomes disposed to<br>observe rules and restraints. Chastisement was ordained by the Creator<br>himself for protecting religion and profit, for the happiness of all the<br>four orders, and for making them righteous and modest. If chastisement<br>could not inspire fear, then ravens and beasts of prey would have eaten<br>up all other animals and men and the clarified butter intended for<br>sacrifice. If chastisement did not uphold and protect, then nobody would<br>have studied the Vedas, nobody would have milked a milch cow, and no<br>maiden would have married.[38] If chastisement did not uphold and<br>protect, then ravage and confusion would have set in on every side, and<br>all barriers would have been swept away, and the idea of property would<br>have disappeared. If chastisement did not uphold and protect, people<br>could never duly perform annual sacrifices with large presents. If<br>chastisement did not uphold and protect, no one, to whatever mode of life<br>he might belong, would observe the duties of that mode as declared (in<br>the scriptures), and no one would have succeeded in acquiring<br>knowledge.[39] Neither camels, nor oxen, nor horses, nor mules, nor<br>asses, would, even if yoked thereto, drag cars and carriages, if<br>chastisement did not uphold and protect. Upon chastisement depend all<br>creatures. The learned, therefore, say that chastisement is the root of<br>everything. Upon chastisement rests the heaven that men desire, and upon<br>it rests this world also. Thither where foe-destroying chastisement is<br>well applied, no sin, no deception, and no wickedness, is to be seen. If<br>the rod of 'chastisement be not uplifted, the dog will lick the<br>sacrificial butter. The crow also would take away the first (sacrificial)<br>offering, if that rod were not kept uplifted. Righteously or<br>unrighteously, this kingdom hath now become ours. Our duty now is to<br>abandon grief. Do thou, therefore, enjoy it and perform sacrifices. Men<br>that are fortunate, living with their dear wives (and children), eat good<br>food, wear excellent clothes, and cheerfully acquire virtue. All our<br>acts, without doubt, are dependent on wealth; that wealth again is<br>dependent on chastisement. Behold, therefore, the importance of<br>chastisement. Duties have been declared for only the maintenance of the<br>relations of the world. There are two things here, viz., abstention from<br>injury and injury prompted by righteous motives. Of these, two, that is<br>superior by which righteousness may be acquired.[40] There is no act that<br>is wholly meritorious, nor any that is wholly wicked. Right or wrong, in<br>all acts, something of both is seen. Subjecting animals to castration,<br>their horns again are cut off. They are then made to bear weights, are<br>tethered, and chastised. In this world that is unsubstantial and rotten<br>with abuses and rendered painful, O monarch, do thou practise the ancient<br>customs of men, following the rules and analogies cited above. Perform<br>sacrifices, give alms, protect thy subjects, and practise righteousness.<br>Slay thy foes, O son of Kunti, and protect thy friends. Let no<br>cheerlessness be thine. O king, while slaying foes. He that does it, O<br>Bharata, does not incur the slightest sin. He that takes up a weapon and<br>slays an armed foe advancing against him, does not incur the sin of<br>killing a foetus, for it is the wrath of the advancing foe that provokes<br>the wrath of the slayer. The inner soul of every creature is incapable of<br>being slain. When the soul is incapable of being slain, how then can one<br>be slain by another? As a person enters a new house, even so a creature<br>enters successive bodies. Abandoning forms that are worn out, a creature<br>acquires new forms. People capable of seeing the truth regard this<br>transformation to be death.'"
