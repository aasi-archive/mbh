                            "Bhishma said, 'The duties in respect of all the four modes of life,<br>those of yatis, O son of Pandu, and the customs relating to the conduct<br>of men in general, are all included in kingly duties. All these acts, O<br>chief of the Bharatas, occur in Kshatriya duties. If the functions of<br>royalty are disturbed, all creatures are overtaken by evil. The duties of<br>men are not obvious. They have, again, many outlets.[200] Led by many<br>(false) systems, their eternal nature is sometimes offended against.<br>Others who pin their faith to the conclusions arrived at by men, without<br>really knowing anything about the truths of duties (as declared in the<br>scriptures), find themselves at last landed and confounded on faiths<br>whose ultimate ends are unknown. The duties imposed upon Kshatriyas are<br>plain, productive of great happiness, evident in respect of their<br>results, free from deceit, and beneficial to the whole world. As the<br>duties of the three orders, as also of Brahmanas and of those that have<br>retired from the world, O Yudhishthira, have before this been said to be<br>all included within those of that sacred mode of life (called<br>Garhasthya), even so, the whole world, with all good actions, are subject<br>to kingly duties. I have told thee, O monarch, how many brave kings had,<br>in days of old, repaired to that lord of all creatures, viz., the divine<br>and puissant Vishnu of great prowess, for resolving their doubts about<br>the science of chastisement. Those kings, mindful of the declarations of<br>the scriptures enforced by examples, waited in days of old upon Narayana,<br>after having weighed each of their acts against the duties of each of the<br>modes of life.[201] Those deities, viz., the Sadhyas, the Vasus, the<br>Aswins, the Rudras, the Viswas, the Maruts, and the Siddhas, created in<br>days of old by the first of gods, are all observant of Kshatriya duties.<br>I shall now recite to thee a history fraught with the conclusions of both<br>morality and profit. In days of old when the Danavas had multiplied and<br>swept away all barriers and distinctions[202] the powerful Mandhatri, O<br>monarch, became king. That ruler of the earth, viz., king Mandhatri,<br>performed a great sacrifice from desire of beholding the puissant<br>Narayana, that god of gods, without beginning, middle, and end. In that<br>sacrifice he worshipped with humility the great Vishnu.[203] The Supreme<br>Lord, assuming the form of Indra, showed himself unto him. Accompanied by<br>many good kings he offered his adorations to that puissant deity. The<br>high discourse took place between that lion among kings and that<br>illustrious god in the form of Indra, touching Vishnu of great<br>effulgence.'<br><br>"Indra said, 'What is your object, O foremost of virtuous persons, in<br>thus seeking to behold that Ancient and First of gods, viz., Narayana, of<br>inconceivable energy, and infinite illusions? Neither myself, nor Brahman<br>himself, can obtain a sight of that god of universal form. I shall grant<br>thee what other objects may be in thy heart, for thou art the foremost of<br>mortals. Thy soul abides in peace; thou art devoted to righteousness;<br>thou hast thy senses under control; and thou art possessed of heroism.<br>Thou seekest unflinchingly to do what is agreeable to the gods. For the<br>sake also of thy intelligence, devotion, and high faith, I shall grant<br>thee whatsoever boons may be desired by thee.'<br><br>"Mandhatri said, I bend my head for gratifying thee. Without doubt,<br>however, I desire to see the first of gods. O divine Lord! Casting off<br>all (earthly) desires, I wish to earn religious merit, and to lead the<br>foremost mode of life, that path of the good, highly regarded by all. By<br>exercising the high duties of a Kshatriya, I have earned many regions of<br>inexhaustible merit in the other world, and I have also, through those<br>duties, spread my fame. I do not, however, know how to discharge those<br>duties, the foremost in the world, that have flowed from the first of<br>gods.'<br><br>"Indra said, 'They that are not kings, however observant they may be of<br>their duties, cannot easily attain the highest rewards of duty. Kingly<br>duties first flowed from the original god. Other duties flowed afterwards<br>from his body. Infinite were the other duties, with those of the<br>Vanaprastha mode of life, that were created afterwards. The fruits of all<br>those are exhaustible. Kingly duties, however, are distinguished above<br>them. In them are included all other duties. For this reason Kshatriya<br>duties are said to be the foremost of all. In days of old, Vishnu, by<br>acting according to Kshatriya duties, forcibly suppressed and destroyed<br>his foes and thereby afforded relief to the gods and the Rishis of<br>immeasurable energy. If the divine Vishnu of inconceivable energy had not<br>slain all his foes among the Asuras, then the Brahmanas, and (Brahman)<br>the Creator of the worlds and Kshatriya duties, and the duties that first<br>flowed from the Supreme deity, would all have been destroyed. If that<br>first and foremost of gods had not, by putting forth his prowess,<br>subjugated the earth with all her Asuras, then all the duties, of the<br>four orders and all the duties in respect of the four modes of life would<br>all have been destroyed in consequence of the destruction of Brahmanas.<br>The eternal duties (of men) had all suffered destruction. It was by the<br>exercise of Kshatriya duties that they were revived.[204] In every Yuga,<br>the duties of Brahmanas in respect of attaining to Brahma first set in.<br>These, however, are all protected by kingly duties. The latter, on this<br>account, are regarded as the foremost. Casting away life in battle,<br>compassion for all creatures, knowledge of the affairs of the world,<br>protection of men, rescuing them from danger, relieving the distressed<br>and the oppressed, all these occur among Kshatriya duties practised by<br>Kings. Persons that do not regard wholesome restraints and that are<br>governed by lust and wrath, do not commit overt acts of sin from fear of<br>kings. Others that are docile and of righteous behaviour succeed, in<br>consequence of the same influence, in performing all their duties. For<br>this reason Kshatriya duties are regarded to be righteous. Without doubt,<br>all creatures live happily in the world, protected by kings exercising<br>Kshatriya duties like children protected by their parents. Kshatriya<br>duties are the foremost of all duties. Those eternal duties, regarded as<br>the first in the world, embrace the protection of every creature.<br>Themselves eternal, they lead to eternal emancipation.'"
