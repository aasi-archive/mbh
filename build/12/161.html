                            "Bhishma said, 'They that are possessed of knowledge say that everything<br>has penance for its root. That foolish person who has not undergone<br>penances does not meet with the rewards of even his own acts. The<br>puissant Creator created all this universe with the aid of penances.<br>After the same manner, the Rishis acquired the Vedas through the power of<br>penances. It was by the aid of penances that the Grandsire created food,<br>fruit and roots. It is by penances that persons crowned with ascetic<br>success behold the three worlds, with rapt souls. Medicines and all<br>antidotes to injurious substances, and the diverse acts (seen here),<br>produce their intended results through the aid of penance. The<br>accomplishment of all purposes depends upon penance. Whatever things<br>there are that are apparently unattainable are sure to be won by the aid<br>of penance. Without doubt, the Rishis obtained their sixfold divine<br>attributes through penance. A person that drinks alcoholic stimulants,<br>one that appropriates the possessions of others without their consent,<br>one guilty of foeticide, one that violates one's preceptor's bed, are all<br>cleansed by penance properly practised. Penances are of many kinds. They<br>exhibit themselves through various outlets. Of all kinds of penances,<br>however, that one may Practise after abstaining from pleasure and<br>enjoyment, abstention from food Is the highest and best. The penance<br>involved in abstention from food is superior, O king, to even compassion,<br>truthfulness of speech, gifts, and restraining the senses. There is no<br>act more difficult to accomplish than gift. There is no mode of life that<br>is superior to serving one's mother. There is no creature superior to<br>those that are conversant with the three Vedas. Similarly, Renunciation<br>constitutes the highest penance. People keep their senses under control<br>for taking care of their virtue and heaven. In respect of such control<br>over the senses as also in the acquisition of virtue, there is no penance<br>higher than abstention from food. The Rishis, the gods, human beings,<br>beasts, birds, and whatever other creatures there are, mobile or<br>immobile, are all devoted to penances, and whatever success they win is<br>won through penance. Thus it was through penance that the gods acquired<br>their superiority These (luminaries in the firmament) that have got their<br>shares of felicity, are always the results of penance. Without doubt,<br>through penance the very status of godhead may be acquired.'"
