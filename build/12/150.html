                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O best of the Bharatas, when a person commits sin<br>from want of judgment, how may he be cleansed from it? Tell me everything<br>about it.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall in this connection recite to thee the old<br>narrative, applauded by the Rishis, of what the regenerate Indrota, the<br>son of Sunaka, said unto Janamejaya. There was in days of yore, a king<br>possessed of great energy, called Janamejaya, who was the son of<br>Parikshit. That lord of earth on one occasion, from want of judgment<br>became guilty of killing a Brahmana. Upon this, all the Brahmanas<br>together with his priests abandoned him. Burning day and night with<br>regret, the king retired into the woods. Deserted by his subjects too, he<br>took this step for achieving high merit. Consumed by repentance, the<br>monarch underwent the most rigid austerities. For washing himself of the<br>sin of Brahmanicide he interrogated many Brahmanas, and wandered from<br>country to country over the whole earth. I shall now tell thee the story<br>of his expiation. Burning with the remembrance of his sinful act,<br>Janamejaya wandered about. One day, in course of his wanderings, he met<br>Indrota, the son of Sunaka, of rigid vows, and approaching him touched<br>his feet. The sage, beholding the king before him, reproved him gravely,<br>saying, 'Thou hast committed a great sin. Thou hast been guilty of<br>foeticide. Why has thou come here? What business hast thou with us? Do<br>not touch me by any means! Go, go away! Thy presence does not give us<br>pleasure. Thy person smells like blood. Thy appearance is like that of a<br>corpse. Though impure, thou seemest to be pure, and though dead thou<br>movest like a living! Dead within, thou art of impure soul, for thou art<br>ever intent upon sin. Though thou sleepest and wakest, thy life, however,<br>is passed in great misery. Thy life, O king, is useless. Thou livest most<br>miserably. Thou hast been created for ignoble and sinful deeds. Sires<br>wish for sons from desire of obtaining diverse kinds of blessings, and<br>hoping they perform penances and sacrifices, worship the gods, and<br>practise renunciation.[438] Behold, the whole race of thy ancestors has<br>fallen into hell in consequence of thy acts. All the hopes thy sires had<br>placed upon thee have become fruitless. Thou livest in vain, for thou art<br>always inspired with hatred and malice towards the Brahmanas&#8212;them, that<br>is, by worshipping whom other men obtain long life, fame, and heaven.<br>Leaving this world (when the time comes), thou shalt have to fall (into<br>hell) with head downwards and remain in that posture for innumerable<br>years in consequence of thy sinful deeds. There thou shalt be tortured by<br>vultures and peacocks having iron beaks. Returning thence into this<br>world, thou shalt have to take birth in a wretched order of creatures. If<br>thou thinkest, O king, that this world is nothing and that the next world<br>is the shadow of a shadow, the myrmidons of Yama in the infernal regions<br>will convince thee, dispelling thy unbelief.'"
