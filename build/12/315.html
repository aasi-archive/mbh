                            "'Yajnavalkya said, These three, O foremost of men, (viz., Sattwa, Rajas,<br>and Tamas), are the attributes of Prakriti. These attach to all things of<br>the universe and always inhere to them. The Unmanifest Purusha endued<br>with the six Yoga attributes transforms himself by himself into hundreds<br>and thousands and millions and millions of forms (by embracing these<br>three attributes). Those that are conversant with the science of<br>Adhyatma, say that unto the attribute of Sattwa is assigned a high, unto<br>Rajas a middling, and unto Tamas, a low place in the universe. By the aid<br>of unmixed righteousness one attains to a high end (viz., that of the<br>deities or other celestial beings). Through righteousness mixed with sin<br>one attains to the status of humanity. While through unmixed sin one<br>sinks into a vile end (by becoming an animal or a vegetable etc.). Listen<br>now to me, O king, as I speak to thee of the intermixture or compounds of<br>the three attributes of Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas. Sometimes Rajas is seen<br>existing with Sattwa. Tamas also exists with Rajas. With Tamas may also<br>be seen Sattwa. Then also may Sattwa and Rajas and Tamas be seen existing<br>together and in equal proportions. They constitute the Unmanifest or<br>Prakriti. When the Unmanifest (Purusha) becomes endued with only Sattwa,<br>he attains to the regions of the deities. Endued with both Sattwa and<br>Rajas, he takes birth among human beings. Endued with Rajas and Tawas, he<br>takes birth among the intermediate order of Being. Endued with all three,<br>viz., Sattwa and Rajas and Tamas, he attains to the status of humanity.<br>Those high souled persons that transcend both righteousness and sin,<br>attain it is said, to that place which is eternal, immutable, undecaying,<br>and immortal. Men of knowledge attain to births that are very superior,<br>and their place is faultless and undecaying, transcending the ken of the<br>senses, free from ignorance, above birth and death, and full of light<br>that dispels all kinds of darkness. Thou hadst asked me about the nature<br>of the Supreme residing in the Unmanifest, (viz., Purusha). I shall tell<br>thee, Listen to me, O king, Even when residing in Prakriti, He is said to<br>reside in His own nature without partaking of the nature of<br>Prakriti.[1650] Prakriti, O king, is inanimate and unintelligent. When<br>presided over by Purusha, then only can she create and destroy.<br><br>"'Janaka said, Both Prakriti and Purusha, O thou of great intelligence,<br>are without beginning and without end. Both of them are without form.<br>Both of them are undecaying. Both of them, again, incomprehensible. How<br>then, O foremost of Rishis, can it be said that one of them is inanimate<br>and unintelligent? How, again, is the other said to be animate and<br>intelligent? And why is the latter called Kshetrajna? Thou, O foremost of<br>Brahmanas, art fully conversant with the entire religion of Emancipation.<br>I desire to hear in detail of the religion of Emancipation in its<br>entirety. Do thou discourse to me then of the existence and Oneness of<br>Purusha, of his separateness from Prakriti, of the deities which attach<br>to the body of the place to which embodied creatures repair when they<br>die, and that place to which they may ultimately, in course of time, be<br>able to go. Tell me also of the Knowledge described in the Sankhya<br>system, and of the Yoga system separately. It behoveth thee also to speak<br>of the premonitory symptoms of death, O best of men. All these topics are<br>well known to thee even as an (emblic) myrobalan in thy hand!'"
