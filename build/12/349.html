                            Janamejaya said, "The illustrious Hari becomes gracious unto them that<br>are devoted to him with their whole souls. He accepts also all worship<br>that is offered to Him agreeably to the ordinance. Of those persons that<br>have burnt off their fuel,[1898] and that are divested of both merit and<br>demerit, that have attained the Knowledge as handed down from preceptor<br>to preceptor&#8212;such persons always attain to that end which is called the<br>fourth, viz., the essence of the Purushottama or Vasudeva,[1899]&#8212;through<br>the three others. Those persons, however, that are devoted to Narayana<br>with their whole souls at once attain to the highest end[1900] Without<br>doubt, the religion of devotion seems to be superior (to that of<br>Knowledge) and is very dear to Narayana. These, without going through the<br>three successive stages (of Aniruddha, Pradyumna, and Sankarshana), at<br>once attain to the immutable Hari. The end that is attained by Brahmanas,<br>who, attending to due observances, study the Vedas with the Upanishads<br>according to the rules laid down for regulating such study, and by those<br>that adopt the religion of Yatis, is inferior, I think, to that attained<br>by persons devoted to Hari with their whole souls. Who first promulgated<br>this religion of Devotion? Was it some deity or some Rishi that declared<br>it? What are the practices of those that are said to be devoted with<br>their whole souls? When did those practices begin? I have doubts on these<br>topics. Do thou remove those doubts. Great is nay curiosity to hear thee<br>explain the several points."[1901]<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "When the diverse divisions of the Pandava and the<br>Kuru armies were drawn up in the array for the battle and when Arjuna<br>became cheerless, the holy one himself explained the question of what is<br>the end and what is not the end attained by persons of different<br>characters. I have before this recited to thee the words of the holy one.<br>The religion preached by the holy one on that occasion is difficult of<br>comprehension. Men of uncleansed souls cannot apprehend it at all. Having<br>created this religion in days of yore, viz., in the Krita age, in perfect<br>consonance with the Samans, it is borne, O king, by the Supreme Lord,<br>viz., Narayana, himself. This very topic was raised by the highly blessed<br>Partha to Narada (for the latter's discourse) in the midst of the Rishis<br>and in the presence of Krishna and Bhishma. My preceptor, viz., the<br>Island-born Krishna heard what Narada said. Receiving it from the<br>celestial Rishis, O best of kings, my preceptor imparted it to me in<br>exactly the same way in which he had obtained it from the celestial<br>Rishi. I shall now recite it to thee, O monarch, in the same way as it<br>has been received from Narada. Listen, therefore, to me. In that Kalpa<br>when Brahma the Creator, O king, took his birth in the mind of Narayana<br>and issued from the latter's mouth, Narayana himself performed, O<br>Bharata, his Daiva and Paitra rites in accordance with this religion.<br>Those Rishis that subsist upon the froth of water then obtained it from<br>Narayana. From the froth-eating Rishis, this religion was obtained by<br>those Rishis that go by the name of Vaikanasas. From the Vaikanasas,<br>Shoma got it. Afterwards, it disappeared from the universe. After the<br>second birth of Brahma, viz., when he sprang from the eyes of Narayana, O<br>king, the Grandsire (that is. Brahma) then received this religion from<br>Shoma. Having received it thus, Brahma imparted this religion, which has<br>Narayana for its soul, unto Rudra. In the Krita age of that ancient<br>Kalpa, Rudra, devoted to Yoga, O monarch, communicated it to all those<br>Rishis that are known by the name of Valikhilyas. Through the illusion of<br>Narayana, it once more disappeared from the universe. In the third birth<br>of Brahma, which was due to the speech of Narayana, this religion once<br>more sprang up, O king, from Narayana himself. Then a Rishi of the name<br>of Suparna obtained it from that foremost of Beings. The Rishi Suparna<br>used to recite this excellent religion, this foremost of cults, three<br>times during the day. In consequence of this, it came to be called by the<br>name of Trisauparna in the world. This religion has been referred to in<br>the Rigveda. The duties it inculcates are exceedingly difficult of<br>observance. From the Rishi Suparna, this eternal religion was obtained, O<br>foremost of men, by the God of wind, that sustainer of the lives of all<br>creatures in the universe. The God of wind communicated it unto such<br>Rishis as subsist upon what remains of sacrificial offerings after<br>feeding guests and others. From those Rishis this excellent religion was<br>obtained by the Great Ocean. It once more disappeared from the universe<br>and became merged into Narayana. In the next birth of the high-souled<br>Brahman when he Sprang from the ear of Narayana, listen, O chief of men,<br>to what happened in that Kalpa. The illustrious Narayana, otherwise<br>called Hari, when he resolved upon Creation, thought of a Being who would<br>be puissant enough to create the universe. While thinking of this, a<br>Being sprang from his ears competent to create the universe. The Lord of<br>all called him by the name of Brahma. Addressing Brahma, the Supreme<br>Narayana said unto him,&#8212;Do thou, O son, create all kinds of creatures<br>from thy mouth and feet. O thou of excellent vows, I shall do what will<br>be beneficial for thee, for I shall impart to thee both energy and<br>strength sufficient to render thee competent for this task. Do thou<br>receive also from me this excellent religion known by the name of<br>Sattwata. Aided by that religion do thou create the Krita age and ordain<br>it duly. Thus addressed, Brahma bowed his head unto the illustrious Hari,<br>the god of the gods and received from him that foremost of all cults with<br>all its mysteries and its abstract of details, together with the<br>Aranyakas,&#8212;viz., that cult, which sprang from the mouth of Narayana.<br>Narayana then instructed Brahma of immeasurable energy in that cult, and<br>addressing him, said,&#8212;Thou art the creator of the duties that are to be<br>observed in the respective Yugas. Having said this unto Brahma, Narayana<br>disappeared and proceeded to that spot which is beyond the reach of<br>Tamas, where the Unmanifest resides, and which is known by the men of<br>acts without desire of fruits. After this, the boon-giving Brahma, the<br>Grandsire of the worlds, created the different worlds with their mobile<br>and immobile creatures. The age that first commenced was highly<br>auspicious and came to be called by the name of Krita. In that age, the<br>religion of Sattwa existed, pervading the entire universe.[1902] With the<br>aid of that primeval religion of righteousness, Brahma, the Creator of<br>all the worlds, worshipped the Lord of all the deities, viz., the<br>puissant Narayana, otherwise called Hari. Then for the spread of that<br>religion and desirous of benefiting the worlds, Brahman instructed that<br>Manu who is known by the name of Swarochish in that cult.<br>Swarochish-Manu, that Lord of all the worlds, that foremost of all<br>persons endued with puissance, then cheerfully imparted the knowledge of<br>that cult to his own son, O king, who was known by the name of<br>Sankhapada. The son of Manu, viz., Sankhapada, communicated the knowledge<br>of that to his own son Suvarnabha who was the Regent of the cardinal and<br>subsidiary points of the compass. When, upon the expiration of the Kriti<br>Yuga, the Treta came, that cult once more disappeared from the world. In<br>a subsequent birth of Brahman, O best of kings, viz., that which was<br>derived from the nose of Narayana. O Bharata, the illustrious and<br>puissant Narayana or Hari with eyes like lotus petals, himself sang this<br>religion in the presence of Brahma. Then the son of Brahma, created by a<br>fiat of his will, viz., Sanatkumara, studied this cult. From Sanatkumara,<br>the Prajapati Virana, in the beginning of the Krita age, O tiger among<br>Kurus, obtained this cult. Virana having studied it in this way, taught<br>it to the ascetic Raivya. Raivya, in his turn, imparted it to his son of<br>pure soul, good vows, and great intelligence, viz., Kukshi, that<br>righteous Regent of the cardinal and subsidiary points of the compass.<br>After this, that cult, born of the mouth of Narayana, once more<br>disappeared from the world. In the next birth of Brahma, viz., that which<br>he was derived from an egg which sprang from Hari, this cult once more<br>issued from the mouth of Narayana. It was received by Brahma, O king, and<br>practised duly in all its details by him. Brahma then communicated it, O<br>monarch, to those Rishis that are known by the name of Varhishada. From<br>the Varhishadas it was obtained by a Brahmana well-versed in the<br>Sama-Veda, and known by the name of Jeshthya. And because he was<br>well-versed with the Samans, therefore was he known also by the name of<br>Jeshthya-Samavrata Hari.[1903] From the Brahmana known by the name of<br>Jeshthya, this cult was obtained by a king of the name of Avikampana.<br>After this, that cult, derived from the puissant Hari, once more<br>disappeared from the world. During the seventh birth of Brahma due to the<br>lotus, O king, that sprang from the navel of Narayana, this cult was once<br>more declared by Narayana himself, unto the Grandsire of pure soul, the<br>Creator of all the worlds, in the beginning of this Kalpa. The Grandsire<br>gave it in days of yore to Daksha (one of his sons created by a fiat of<br>his will). Daksha, in his turn, imparted it to the eldest of all the sons<br>of his daughters, O monarch, viz., Aditya who is senior in age to<br>Savitri. From Aditya, Vivaswat obtained it. In the beginning of the Treta<br>Yuga, Vivaswat imparted the knowledge of this cult to Manu. Manu, for the<br>protection and support of all the worlds, then gave it to his son<br>Ikshaku.[1904] Promulgated by Ikshaku, that cult over-spreads the whole<br>world. When the universal destruction comes, it will once more return to<br>Narayana and be merged in Him. The religion which is followed and<br>practised by the Yatis, has, O best of kings, been narrated to thee<br>before this in the Hari Gita, with all its ordinances in brief. The<br>celestial Rishi Narada got it from that Lord of universe, viz., Narayana<br>himself, O king, with all its mysteries and abstract of details. Thus, O<br>monarch, this foremost of cults is primeval and eternal. Incapable of<br>being comprehended with ease and exceedingly difficult of being<br>practised, it is always upheld by persons wedded to the attribute of<br>Sattwa. It is by means of acts that are well-performed and accomplished<br>with a full knowledge of duties and in which there is nothing of injury<br>to any creature,&#8212;that Hari the Supreme Lord becomes gratified. Some<br>persons adore Narayana as possessed of only one form, viz., that of<br>Aniruddha. Some adore Him as endued with two forms, viz., that of<br>Aniruddha and Pradyumna. Some adore Him as having three forms, viz.,<br>Aniruddha, Pradyumna, and Sankarshana. A fourth class adore him as<br>consisting of four forms, viz., Aniruddha, Pradyumna, Sankarshana, and<br>Vasudeva. Hari is Himself the Kshetrajna (Soul). He is without parts<br>(being ever full). He is the Jiva in all creatures, transcending the five<br>primal elements. He is the Mind, O monarch, that directs and controls the<br>five senses. Endued with the highest intelligence. He is the Ordainer of<br>the universe, and the Creator thereof. He is both active and inactive. He<br>is both Cause and the Effect. He is the one immutable Purusha, who sports<br>as He likes, O king. Thus have I recited to thee the religion of<br>desireless Devotees, O best of kings, incapable of being comprehended by<br>persons of uncleansed souls but this I acquired through the grace of my<br>preceptor. Persons are very rare, O king, that are devoted to Narayana<br>with whole souls. If, O son of Kuru's race the world had been full of<br>such persons, that are full of universal compassion, that are endued with<br>knowledge of the soul, and that are always employed in doing good to<br>others, then the Krita age would have set in. All men would have betaken<br>themselves to the accomplishment of acts without desire of fruit. It was<br>even in this way, O monarch, that, that foremost of regenerate persons,<br>(viz., the illustrious Vyasa), my preceptor, fully conversant with all<br>duties, discoursed unto king Yudhishthira the just on this religion of<br>Devotion, in the presence of many Rishis and in the hearing of Krishna<br>and Bhishma. He had obtained it from the celestial Rishi Narada endued<br>with wealth of penances. Those persons that are devoted to Narayana with<br>their whole souls and are desireless succeed in attaining to the region<br>of that highest of deities, identical with Brahma, pure in complexion,<br>possessed of the effulgence of the moon and endued with immutability.<br><br>Janamejaya said, "I see that those regenerate persons whose souls have<br>been awakened practise diverse kinds of duties. Why is it that other<br>Brahmanas instead of practising those duties betake themselves to the<br>observance of other kinds of vows and rites?"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Three kinds of disposition, O monarch, have been<br>created in respect of all embodied creatures, viz., that which relates to<br>the attribute of Sattwa, that which relates to the attribute of Rajas,<br>and lastly that which relates to the attribute of Tamas, O Bharata. As<br>regards embodied creatures, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, that person is<br>the foremost who is wedded to the attribute of Sattwa, for, O tiger among<br>men, it is certain that he will attain to Emancipation. It is with the<br>aid of this very attribute of Sattwa that one endued therewith succeeds<br>in understanding the person that is conversant with Brahma. As regards<br>Emancipation, it is entirely dependent upon Narayana. Hence it is that<br>persons striving after Emancipation are regarded as made up of the<br>attribute of Sattwa. By thinking of Purushottama the foremost of Beings,<br>the man that is devoted with his whole soul to Narayana, acquires great<br>wisdom. Those persons that are endued with wisdom, that have betaken<br>themselves to the practices of Yatis and the religion of<br>Emancipation,&#8212;those persons of quenched thirst, always find that Hari<br>favours them with the fruition of their desire.[1905] That man subject to<br>birth (and death) upon whom Hari casts a kind eye should be known as<br>endued with the attribute of Sattwa and devoted to the acquisition of<br>Emancipation. The religion followed by a person that is devoted with his<br>whole soul to Narayana is regarded as similar or equal in merit to the<br>system of the Sankhyas. By adopting that religion one attains to the<br>highest end and attains to Emancipation which has Narayana for its soul.<br>That person upon whom Narayana looks with compassion succeeds in becoming<br>awakened.[1906] No one, O king, can become awakened through his own<br>wishes. That nature which partakes of both Rajas and Tamas is said to be<br>mixed. Hari never casts a kind eye upon the person subject to birth (and<br>death) that is endued with such a mixed nature and that has, on that<br>account, the principle of Pravritti in him. Only Brahma, the Grandsire of<br>the worlds, looks upon the person that is subject to birth and death<br>because of his mind being overwhelmed with the two inferior attributes of<br>Rajas and Tamas.[1907] Without doubt, the deities and the Rishis are<br>wedded to the attributes of Sattwa, O best of kings. But then they that<br>are divested of that attribute in its subtile form are always regarded to<br>be of mutable nature".[1908]<br><br>Janamejaya said, "How can one that is fraught with the principle of<br>change succeed in attaining to that Purushottama (the foremost of<br>Purusha)? Do tell me all this, which is, no doubt, known to thee. Do thou<br>discourse to me also of Pravritti in due order."<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "That which is the twenty-fifth (in the enumeration of<br>topics as made in the Sankhya system) viz., when it becomes able to<br>abstain entirely from acts, succeeds in attaining to the Purushottama<br>which is exceedingly subtile, which is invested with the attribute of<br>Sattwa (in its subtile form), and which is fraught with the essences<br>symbolised by three letters of the alphabet (viz., A, U, and M). The<br>Sankhya system, the Aranyaka-Veda, and the Pancharatra scriptures, are<br>all one and the same and form parts of one whole. Even this is the<br>religion of those that are devoted with their whole souls to Narayana,<br>the religion that has Narayana for its essence.[1909] As waves of the<br>ocean, rising from the ocean, rush away from it only to return to it in<br>the end, even so diverse kinds of knowledge, springing from Narayana,<br>return to Narayana in the end. I have thus explained to thee, O son of<br>Kuru's race, what the religion of Sattwa is. If thou beest competent for<br>it, O Bharata, do thou practise that religion duly. Even thus did the<br>highly-blessed Narada explain to my preceptor,&#8212;the Island-born<br>Krishna&#8212;the eternal and immutable course, called Ekanta, (ending in One)<br>followed by the Whites[1910] as also by the yellow-robed Yatis. Vyasa<br>gratified with Dharma's son Yudhishthira, imparted this religion to king<br>Yudhishthira the just who was possessed of great intelligence. Derived<br>from my preceptor I have also communicated it to thee! O best of kings,<br>this religion is for these reasons, exceedingly difficult of practice.<br>Others, hearing it, become as much confounded as thou hast suffered<br>thyself to be. It is Krishna who is the protector of the universe and its<br>beguiler. It is He who is the destroyer and the cause, O monarch."
