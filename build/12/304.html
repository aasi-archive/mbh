                            "'Vasishtha said, 'Thus in consequence of his forgetfulness the Soul<br>follows ignorance and obtains thousands of bodies one after another. He<br>attains to thousands of births among the intermediate orders and<br>sometimes among the very gods in consequence of his union with<br>(particular) attributes and the puissance of attributes.[1615] From the<br>status of humanity, he goes to heaven and from heaven he comes back to<br>humanity, and from humanity he sinks into hell for many long years. As<br>the worm that fabricates the cocoon shuts itself, completely on every<br>side by means of the threads it weaves itself, even so the Soul, though<br>in reality transcending all attributes, invests himself on every side<br>with attributes (and deprives himself of liberty).[1616] Though<br>transcending (in his real nature) both happiness and misery, it is thus<br>that he subjects himself to happiness and misery. It is thus also that,<br>though transcending all diseases, the Soul regards himself to be<br>afflicted by headache and opthalmia and toothache and affections of the<br>throat and abdominal dropsy, and burning thirst, and enlargement of<br>glands, and cholera, and vitiligo, and leprosy, and burns, and asthma and<br>phthisis, and epilepsy, and whatever other diseases of diverse kinds are<br>seen in the bodies of embodied creatures. Regarding himself, through<br>error, as born among thousands of creatures in the intermediate orders of<br>being, and sometimes among the gods, he endures misery and enjoys the<br>fruits of his good deeds. Invested with Ignorance he regards himself as<br>robed sometimes in white cloth and sometimes in full dress consisting of<br>four pieces or as lying on floors (instead of on beds or bedsteads) or<br>with hands and feet contracted like those of frogs or as seated upright<br>in the attitude of ascetic contemplation, or as' clad in rags or as lying<br>or sitting under the canopy of heaven or within mansions built of bricks<br>and stone or on rugged stones or on ashes or bare stones or on the bare<br>earth or on beds or on battlefields or in water or in mire or on wooden<br>planks or on diverse kinds of beds; or impelled by desire of fruits, he<br>regards himself as clad in a scant piece of cloth made of grass or as<br>totally nude or as robed in silk or in skin of the black antelope or in<br>cloth made of flax or in sheep-skin or in tiger-skin or in lion-skin or<br>in fabric of hemp, or in barks of birch or in cloths made of the produce<br>of prickly plants, or in vestures made of threads woven by worms or of<br>torn rags or in diverse other kinds of cloth too numerous to mention. The<br>soul regards himself also as wearing diverse kinds of ornaments and gems,<br>or as eating diverse kinds of food. He regards himself as sometimes<br>eating at intervals of one night, or once at the same hour every day, or<br>as at the fourth, the sixth, and the eighth hour every day, or as once in<br>six or seven or eight nights, or as once in ten or twelve day, or as once<br>in a month, of as eating only roots, or fruits, or as subsisting upon air<br>or water alone, or on cakes of sesame husk, or curds or cowdung, or the<br>urine of the cow or potherbs or flowers or moss or raw food, or as<br>subsisting on fallen leaves of trees or fruits that have fallen down and<br>lay scattered on the ground, or diverse other kinds of food, impelled by<br>the desire of winning (ascetic) success. The Soul regards himself as<br>adopting the observance of Chandrayana according to the rites ordained in<br>the scriptures, or diverse other vows and observance, and the courses of<br>duty prescribed for the four modes of life, and even derelictions of<br>duty, and the duties of other subsidiary modes of life included in the<br>four principal ones, and even diverse kinds of practices that distinguish<br>the wicked and sinful. The Soul regards himself as enjoying retired spots<br>and delightful shades of mountains and the cool vicinity of spring and<br>fountain and solitary river banks and secluded forests, and sacred spots<br>dedicated to the deities, and lakes and waters withdrawn from the busy<br>hunts of men, and lone mountain caves affording the accommodation that<br>houses and mansions afford. The Soul regards himself as employed in the<br>recitation of different kinds of hidden Mantras or as observing different<br>vows and rules and diverse kinds of penances, and sacrifices of many<br>kinds, and rites of diverse sorts. The Soul regards himself as adopting<br>sometimes the way of traders and merchants and the practices of Brahmanas<br>and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras, and gifts of diverse kinds unto<br>those that are destitute or blind or help-less. In consequence of his<br>being invested with Ignorance, the Soul adopts different attributes of<br>Sattwa and Rajas and Tamas, and Righteousness and Wealth and pleasure.<br>Under the influence of Prakriti the Soul, undergoing modification<br>himself, observes and adopts and practices all these and regards himself<br>as such. Indeed, the Soul regards himself as employed in the utterance of<br>the sacred mantras Swaha and Swadha and Vashat, and in bowing unto those<br>he regards as his Superiors; in officiating in the sacrifices of others,<br>in teaching pupils, making gifts and accepting them; in performing<br>sacrifices and studying, the scriptures, and doing all other acts and<br>rites of this kind. The Soul regards himself as concerned with birth and<br>death and disputes and slaughter. All these, the learned say, constitute<br>the path of acts good and bad. It is the goddess Prakriti who causes<br>birth and death. When the time approaches for universal Destruction, all<br>existent objects and attributes are withdrawn by the Supreme Soul which<br>then exists alone like the Sun withdrawing at evening all his rays; and<br>when the time comes for Creation He once more creates and spreads them<br>out like the Sun shedding and spreading out his rays when morning comes.<br>Even thus the Soul, for the sake of sport, repeatedly regards himself<br>invested with all these conditions, which are his own forms and<br>attributes, infinite in number, and agreeable to himself. It is this way<br>that the Soul, though really transcending the three attributes, becomes<br>attached to the path of acts and creates by modification Prakriti<br>invested with the attributes of birth and death and identical with all<br>acts and conditions which are characterised by the three attributes of<br>Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas. Arrived at the path of action, the Soul regards<br>particular acts to be endued with particular characteristics and<br>productive of particular ends. O monarch, the whole of this universe has<br>been blinded by Prakriti and all things have been diversely overwhelmed<br>(through Prakriti) by the attributes of Rajas and Tamas. It is in<br>consequence of the Soul being invested by Prakriti that these pairs of<br>opposites productive of happiness and woe, repeatedly come. It is in<br>consequence of this Ignorance that Jiva regards these sorrows to be his<br>and imagines them as pursuing him. Indeed, O monarch, through that<br>Ignorance it is that Jiva imagines he should anyhow cross those sorrows,<br>and that he should, going into the regions of the gods, enjoy the<br>felicity that awaits all his good acts. It is through Ignorance that he<br>thinks he should enjoy and endure these delights and these woes here in<br>this world Through Ignorance Jiva thinks,&#8212;I should secure my happiness.<br>By continually doing good acts, I may have happiness in this life till<br>its close and I shall be happy in all my future lives. Though, again the<br>(evil) acts I do in this life unending sorrow may become mine. The status<br>of humanity is fraught with great misery, for from it one sinks into<br>hell. From hell, it will take many long years before I can come back to<br>the status of humanity. From humanity I shall attain to the status of the<br>gods. From that superior status I shall have to come back again to<br>humanity and thence to sink into hell once more!&#8212;One who always regards<br>this combination of the primal elements and the senses, with the Chit's<br>reflection in it, to be thus invested with the characteristics of the<br>Soul, has repeatedly to wander among gods and human beings and to sink<br>into hell. Being always invested with the idea of meum, Jiva has to make<br>a round of such births. Millions upon millions of birth have to be gone<br>through by Jiva in the successive forms he assumes, all of which are<br>liable to death. He who does acts in this way, which are all fraught with<br>good and bad fruits, has in the three worlds to assume successive form<br>and to enjoy and endure fruits corresponding therewith. It is Prakriti<br>that cause acts fraught with good and bad acts; and it is Prakriti that<br>enjoys and endures the fruits thereof in the three worlds. Indeed,<br>Prakriti follows the course of acts. The status of the intermediate<br>beings, of humanity, and of the gods as well,&#8212;these three<br>fields,&#8212;should be known as originating in Prakriti and has been said to<br>be destitute of all attributes. Her existence is affirmed only in<br>consequence of her acts (beginning with Mahat). After the same manner,<br>Purusha (or Soul), though without attributes himself, has his existence<br>affirmed in consequence of the acts which the body does when it receives<br>his reflection. Although the Soul is not subject to modifications of any<br>kind and is the active principle that sets Prakriti in motion, yet<br>entering a body that is united with the senses of knowledge and action,<br>he regards all the acts of those senses as his own. The five senses of<br>knowledge beginning with the ear, and those of action beginning with<br>speech, uniting with the attributes of Sattwa and Rajas and Tamas, become<br>engaged in numerous object. Jiva imagines that it is he who does the acts<br>of his life and that the senses of knowledge and acts belong to him,<br>although in reality he has no senses. Indeed, though unequipt with body,<br>he imagines that he has a body. Though destitute of attributes, he<br>regards himself as endued therewith, and though transcending Time,<br>imagines himself to be under Time's control. Though destitute of<br>understanding, he still regards himself as endued therewith, and though<br>transcending the (four and twenty) topics, regards himself as one<br>included among them. Though deathless, he still regards himself as liable<br>to death, and though motionless regards himself to be endued with motion.<br>Though not possessed of a material case, he still regards himself as<br>possessed of one; and though unborn, he still regards himself as<br>in-vested with birth. Though transcending penances, he still regards as<br>engaged in penances, and though he has no end (after which to strive), he<br>still regards himself as liable to attain to ends (of diverse kinds).<br>Though not endued with motion and birth, he still regards himself as<br>endued with both, and though transcending fear, still regards himself as<br>liable to fear. Though Indestructible, he still regards himself<br>Destructible. Invested with Ignorance, the Soul thus thinks of himself."
