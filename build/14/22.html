                            "The Brahmana said, 'In this connection is cited the ancient story, O<br>blessed one, of what the institution is of the seven sacrificing priests.<br>The nose, the eye, the tongue, the skin, and the ear numbering the fifth,<br>the mind, and the understanding,&#8212;these are the seven sacrificing priests<br>standing distinctly from one another. Dwelling in subtle space, they do<br>not perceive one another. Do thou, O beautiful one, know these<br>sacrificing priests that are seven by their nature.'"<br><br>"The Brahmana's wife said, 'How is it that dwelling in subtle space,<br>these do not perceive one another? What are their (respective) natures, O<br>holy one? Do thou tell me this, O lord.'"<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'Not knowing the qualities (of any object) is<br>ignorance (of that object); while knowledge of the qualities is (called)<br>knowledge (of the object which possesses those qualities). These seven<br>never succeed in apprehending or knowing the qualities of one another.<br>The tongue, the eye, the ear too, the skin, the mind, and the<br>understanding, do not succeed in apprehending smells. It is the nose<br>alone that apprehends them. The nose, the tongue, the ear also, the skin,<br>the mind, and the understanding, never succeed in apprehending colours.<br>It is the eye alone that apprehends them. The nose, the tongue, the eye<br>too, the ear, the understanding, and the mind, never succeed in<br>apprehending sensations of touch It is the skin alone that apprehends<br>them. The nose, the tongue, the eye, the skin, the mind, and the<br>understanding, never succeed in apprehending sounds. It is the ear alone<br>that apprehends them. The nose, the tongue, the eye, the skin, the ear,<br>and the understanding never succeed in apprehending doubt. It is the mind<br>that apprehends it. The nose, the tongue, the eye, the skin, the ear, and<br>the mind, never succeed in apprehending determination (certainty in<br>respect of knowledge). It is the understanding alone that apprehends it.<br>In this connection, is cited, O beautiful lady, this ancient narrative of<br>a discourse between the senses and the mind.'<br><br>"The mind said, 'The nose does not smell without me. (Without me) the<br>tongue does not apprehend taste. The eye does not seize colour, the skin<br>does not feel touch, the ear does not apprehend sound, when deprived of<br>me. I am the eternal and foremost one among all the elements. It always<br>happens that destitute of myself, the senses never shine, like<br>habitations empty of inmates or fires whose flames have been quenched.<br>Without me, all creatures fail to apprehend qualities and objects, with<br>even the senses exerting themselves, even as fuel that is wet and dry<br>(failing to ignite a fire).'<br><br>"Hearing these words, the Senses said, 'Even this would be true as thou<br>thinkest in this matter, if, indeed, thou couldst enjoy pleasures without<br>either ourselves or our objects.[63] What thou thinkest, would be true,<br>if, when we are extinct, there be gratification and support of life, and<br>a continuation of thy enjoyments, or, if, when we are absorbed and<br>objects are existing, thou canst have thy enjoyments by thy desire alone,<br>as truly as thou hast them with our aid. If, again, thou deemest thy<br>power over our objects to be always complete, do thou then seize colour<br>by the nose, and taste by the eye. Do thou also take smell by the ear,<br>and sensations of touch by the tongue. Do thou also take sounds by the<br>skin, and likewise touch by the understanding. They that are powerful do<br>not own the dominion of any rules. Rules exist for those only that are<br>weak. Do thou seize enjoyments unenjoyed before; it behoves thee not to<br>enjoy what has been tasted before (by others). As a disciple repairs to a<br>preceptor for the sake of (acquiring) the Srutis, and then, having<br>acquired the Srutis, dwells on their import (by obeying their<br>injunctions), even so dost thou regard as thine those objects which are<br>shown by us, past or future, in sleep or in wakefulness. Of creatures,<br>again, that are of little intelligence, when their mind becomes<br>distracted and cheerless, life is seen to be upheld upon our objects<br>discharging their functions.[64] It is seen also that a creature, after<br>having formed even innumerable purposes and indulged in dreams, when<br>afflicted by the desire to enjoy, runs to objects of sense at once.[65]<br>One entering upon enjoyments depending on mental purposes alone and<br>unconnected with actual objects of sense, always meets with death upon<br>the exhaustion of the life-breaths, like an enkindled fire upon the<br>exhaustion of fuel. True it is that we have connections with our<br>respective attributes; true it is, we have no knowledge of one another's<br>attributes. But without us thou canst have no perception. Without us no<br>happiness can come to thee.'"
