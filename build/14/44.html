                            "Brahmana said, 'I shall now tell you truly about all that which has a<br>beginning, middle, and end, and which is endued with name and<br>characteristics, together with the means of apprehension. It has been<br>said that the Day was first, Then arose Night. The Months are said to<br>have the lighted fortnights first. The constellations have Sravana for<br>their first; the Seasons have that of dews (viz., Winter) for their<br>first. Earth is the source of all smells; and Water of all tastes. The<br>solar light is the source of all colours: the Wind of all sensations of<br>touch. Likewise, of sound the source is space (or Ether). These are the<br>qualities of elements. I shall, after this, declare that which is the<br>first and the highest of all entities. The sun is the first of all<br>lighted bodies. Fire is said to be the first of all the elements. Savitri<br>is the first of all branches of learning. Prajapati is the first of all<br>the deities. The syllable Om is the first of all the Vedas, and the<br>life-wind Prana is the first of all winds. All that is called Savitri<br>which is prescribed in this world.[130] The Gayatri is the first of all<br>metres; of all (sacrificial) animals the first is the goat. Kine are the<br>first of all quadrupeds. The twiceborn ones are the first of all human<br>beings. The hawk is the first of all birds. Of sacrifices the first is<br>the pouring of clarified butter on the fire. Of all reptiles the first, O<br>foremost of regenerate ones, is the snake. The Krita is the first of all<br>the Yugas; there is no doubt in this. Gold is the first of all precious<br>things. Barley is the first of all plants. Food is the first of all<br>things to be eaten or swallowed. Of all liquid substances to be drunk,<br>water is the foremost. Of all immobile entities without distinction,<br>Plaksha is said to be the first, that ever holy field of Brahman. Of all<br>the Prajapatis I am the first. There is no doubt in this. Of<br>inconceivable soul, the self-existent Vishnu is said to be my<br>superior.[131] Of all the mountains the great Meru is said to be the<br>first-born. Of all the cardinal and subsidiary points of the horizon, the<br>eastern is said to be the foremost and first-born. Ganga of three courses<br>is said to be the firstborn of all rivers. Likewise, of all wells and<br>reservoirs of waters, the ocean is said to be the first-born. Iswara is<br>the supreme Lord of all the deities and Danavas and ghostly beings and<br>Pisachas, and snakes and Makshasas and human beings and Kinnaras and<br>Yakshas. The great Vishnu, who is full of Brahma, than whom there is no<br>higher being in the three worlds, is the first of all the universe. Of<br>all the modes of life, that of the householder is the first. Of this<br>there is no doubt. The Unmanifest is the source of all the worlds as,<br>indeed, that is the end of every thing. Days end with the sun's setting<br>and Nights with the sun's rising. The end of pleasure is always sorrow,<br>and the end of sorrow is always pleasure. All accumulations have<br>exhaustion for their end, and all ascent have falls for their end. All<br>associations have dissociations for their end, and life has death for its<br>end. All action ends in destruction, and all that is born is certain to<br>meet with death. Every mobile and immobile thing in this world is<br>transient. Sacrifice, gift, penances, study, vows, observances,&#8212;all<br>these have destruction for their end. Of Knowledge, there is no end.<br>Hence, one that is possessed of a tranquil soul, that has subjugated his<br>senses, that is freed from the sense of meum, that is devoid of egoism,<br>is released from all sins by pure knowledge.'"
