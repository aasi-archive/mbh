                            'Brahmana said, From Egoism were verily born the five great elements.<br>They are earth, air, ether, water, and light numbering the fifth. In<br>these five great elements, in the matter of the sound, touch, colour,<br>taste, and smell, all creatures become deluded. When at the close of the<br>destruction of the great elements, the dissolution of the universe<br>approaches, ye that are possessed of wisdom, a great fear comes upon all<br>living creatures. Every existent object is dissolved into that from which<br>it is produced. The dissolution takes place in an order that is the<br>reverse of that in which creation takes place. Indeed, as regards birth,<br>they are born from one another. Then, when all existent objects, mobile<br>and immobile, become dissolved, wise men endued with powerful memory<br>never dissolve. Sound, touch, colour, taste, and smell numbering the<br>fifth, are effects. They are, however, inconstant, and called by the name<br>of delusion. Caused by the production of cupidity, not different from one<br>another, without reality, connected with flesh and blood, and depending<br>upon one another, existing outside the soul, these are all helpless and<br>powerless. Prana and Apana, and Udana and Samana and Vyana,&#8212;these five<br>winds are always closely attached to the soul. Together with speech,<br>mind, and understanding, they constitute the universe of eight<br>ingredients. He whose skin, nose, ear, eyes, tongue, and speech are<br>restrained, whose mind is pure, and whose understanding deviates not<br>(from the right path), and whose mind is never burnt by those eight<br>fires, succeeds in attaining to that auspicious Brahman to which nothing<br>superior exists. Those which have been called the eleven organs and which<br>have sprung from Egoism, I shall now, ye regenerate ones, mention<br>particularly. They are the ear, the skin, the two eyes, the tongue, the<br>nose numbering the fifth, the two feet, the lower duct, the organ of<br>generation, the two hands, and speech forming the tenth. These constitute<br>the group of organs, with mind numbering as the eleventh. One should<br>first subdue this group. Then will Brahman shine forth (in him). Five<br>amongst these are called organs of knowledge, and five, organs of action.<br>The five beginning with the ear are truly said to be connected with<br>knowledge. The rest, however, that are connected with action, are without<br>distinction. The mind should be regarded as belonging to both. The<br>understanding is the twelfth in the top. Thus have been enumerated the<br>eleven organs in due order. Learned men, having understood these, think<br>they have accomplished everything. I shall, after this, enumerate all the<br>various organs. Space (or Ether) is the first entity. As connected with<br>the soul, it is called the ear. As connected with objects, that is sound.<br>The presiding deity (of this) is the quarters. The Wind is the second<br>entity. As connected with the soul, it is known as the skin. As connected<br>with objects, it is known as objects of touch; and the presiding deity<br>there is touch. The third is said to be Light. As connected with the<br>soul, it is known as the eye. As connected with objects, it is colour;<br>and the sun is its deity. The fourth (entity) should be known as Water.<br>As connected with the soul, it is said to be the tongue. As connected<br>with objects, it is taste, and the presiding deity there is Soma. The<br>fifth entity is Earth. As connected with the soul, it is said to be the<br>nose. As connected with objects, it is scent; and the presiding deity<br>there is the wind. Thus has the manner been declared of how the five<br>entities are divided into sets of three. After this I shall declare<br>everything about the diverse (other) organs. Brahmanas conversant with<br>the truth say that the two feet are mentioned as connected with the soul.<br>As connected with objects, it is motion; and Vishnu is there the<br>presiding deity. The Apana wind, whose motion is downward, as connected<br>with the soul, is called the lower duct. As connected with objects, it is<br>the excreta that is ejected; and the presiding deity there is Mitra. As<br>connected with the soul, the organ of generation is mentioned, the<br>producer of all beings. As connected with objects, it is the vital seed;<br>and the presiding deity is Prajapati. The two hands are mentioned as<br>connected with the soul by persons conversant with the relations of the<br>soul. As connected with objects, it is actions; and the presiding deity<br>there is Indra. Next, connected with the soul is speech which relates to<br>all the gods. As connected with objects, it is what is spoken. The<br>presiding deity there is Agni. As connected with the soul, the mind is<br>mentioned, which moves within the soul of the five elements.[113] As<br>connected with objects, it is the mental operation; and the presiding<br>deity is Chandramas (moon). As connected with the soul is Egoism, which<br>is the cause of the whole course of worldly life. As connected with<br>objects, it is consciousness of self; and the presiding deity there is<br>Rudra. As connected with the soul is the understanding, which impels the<br>six senses. As connected with objects, it is that which is to be<br>understood, and the presiding deity there is Brahma. Three are the seats<br>of all existent objects. A fourth is not possible. These are land, water,<br>and ether. The mode of birth is fourfold. Some are born of eggs; some are<br>born of germs which spring upwards, penetrating through the earth; some<br>are born of filth; and some are born of fleshy balls in wombs. Thus is<br>the mode of birth seen to be of four kinds, of all living creatures. Now,<br>there are other inferior beings and likewise those that range the sky.<br>These should be known to be born of eggs as also those which crawl on<br>their breasts. Insects are said to be born of filth, as also other<br>creatures of a like description. This is said to be the second mode of<br>birth and is inferior. Those living creatures that take birth after the<br>lapse of some time, bursting through the earth, are said to be germ-born<br>beings, ye foremost of regenerate persons. Creatures of two feet or of<br>many feet and those which move crookedly, are the beings born of wombs.<br>Among them are some that are deformed, ye best of men. The eternal womb<br>of Brahma should be known to be of two kinds, viz., penance and<br>meritorious acts. Such is the doctrine of the learned.[114] Action should<br>be understood to be of various kinds, such as sacrifice, gifts made at<br>sacrifices, and the meritorious duty of study for every one that is born;<br>such is the teaching of the ancients. He who duly understands this, comes<br>to be regarded as possessed of Yoga, ye chief of regenerate persons. Know<br>also that such a man becomes freed too from all his sins. I have thus<br>declared to you duly the doctrine of Adhyatma.[115] Ye Rishis conversant<br>with all duties, a knowledge of this is acquired by those who are<br>regarded as persons of knowledge. Uniting all these together, viz., the<br>senses, the objects of the senses, and the five great entities, one<br>should hold them in the mind.[116] When everything is attenuated (by<br>absorption) in the mind, one no longer esteems the pleasures of life.<br>Learned men, whose understandings are furnished with knowledge, regard<br>that as true happiness.[117] I shall after this, tell thee of<br>renunciation with respect to all entities by means, gentle and hard,<br>which produces attachment to subtle topics and which is fraught with<br>auspiciousness. That conduct which consists in treating the qualities is<br>not qualities, which is free from attachment, which is living alone,<br>which does not recognise distinctions, and which is full of Brahman, is<br>the source of all happiness.[118] The learned man who absorbs all desires<br>into himself from all sides like the tortoise withdrawing all its limbs,<br>who is devoid of passion, and who is released from everything, becomes<br>always happy. Restraining all desires within the soul, destroying his<br>thirst, concentrated in meditation, and becoming the friend of good heart<br>towards all creatures, he succeeds in becoming fit for assimilation with<br>Brahman. Through repression of all the senses which always hanker after<br>their objects, and abandonment of inhabited places, the Adhyatma fire<br>blazes forth in the man of contemplation. As a fire, fed with fuel,<br>becomes bright in consequence of the blazing flames it puts forth, even<br>so, in consequence of the repression of the senses, the great soul puts<br>forth its effulgence. When one with a tranquil soul beholds all entities<br>in one's own heart, then, lighted by one's own effulgence, one attains to<br>that which is subtler than the subtle and which is unrivalled in<br>excellence. It is settled that the body has fire for colour, water for<br>blood and other liquids, wind for sense of touch, earth for the hideous<br>holder of mind (viz., flesh and bones, etc.), space (or ether) for sound;<br>that it is pervaded by disease and sorrow; that it is overwhelmed by five<br>currents; that it is made up of the five elements; that it has nine doors<br>and two deities;[119] that it is full of passion; that it is unfit to be<br>seen (owing to its unholy character); that it is made up of three<br>qualities; that it has three constituent elements, (viz., wind, bile and<br>phelgm); that it is delighted with attachments of every kind, that it is<br>full of delusions.[120] It is difficult of being moved in this mortal<br>world, and it rests on the understanding as its support. That body is, in<br>this world, the wheel of Time that is continually revolving.[121] That<br>(body), indeed, is a terrible and unfathomable ocean and is called<br>delusion. It is this body which stretches forth, contracts, and awakens<br>the (whole) universe with the (very) immortals.[122] By restraining the<br>senses, one casts off lust, wrath, fear, cupidity, enmity, and falsehood,<br>which are eternal and, therefore, exceedingly difficult to cast off.[123]<br>He who has subjugated these in this world, viz., the three qualities and<br>the five constituent elements of the body, has the Highest for his seat<br>in Heaven. By him is Infinity attained. Crossing the river, that has the<br>five senses for its steep banks, the mental inclinations for its mighty<br>waters, and delusion for its lake, one should subjugate both lust and<br>wrath. Such a man freed from all faults, then beholds the Highest,<br>concentrating the mind within the mind and seeing self in self.<br>Understanding all things, he sees his self, with self, in all creatures,<br>sometimes as one and sometimes as diverse, changing form from time to<br>time.[124] Without doubt he can perceive numerous bodies like a hundred<br>lights from one light. Verily he is Vishnu, and Mitra, and Varuna, and<br>Agni, and Prajapati. He is the Creator and the ordainer: he is the Lord<br>possessed of puissance, with faces turned in all directions. In him, the<br>heart of all creatures, the great soul, becomes resplendent. Him all<br>conclaves of learned Brahmanas, deities and Asuras, and Yakshas, and<br>Pisachas, the Pitris, and birds, and bands of Rakshasas, and bands of<br>ghostly beings, and all the great Rishis, praise.'"
