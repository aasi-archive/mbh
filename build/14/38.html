It is<br>beneficial to all creatures in the world, and unblamable, and constitutes<br>the conduct of those that are good. Joy, satisfaction, nobility,<br>enlightenment, and happiness, absence of stinginess (or liberality),<br>absence of fear, contentment, disposition for faith, forgiveness,<br>courage, abstention from injuring any creature, equability, truth,<br>straightforwardness, absence of wrath, absence of malice, purity,<br>cleverness, prowess, (these appertain to the quality of Goodness). He who<br>is devoted to the duty of Yoga, regarding knowledge to be vain, conduct<br>to be vain, service to be vain, and mode of life to be vain, attains to<br>what is highest in the world hereafter. Freedom from the idea of meum,<br>freedom from egoism, freedom from expectations, looking on all with an<br>equal eye, and freedom from desire,&#8212;these constitute the eternal<br>religion of the good. Confidence, modesty, forgiveness, renunciation,<br>purity, absence of laziness, absence of cruelty, absence of delusion,<br>compassion to all creatures, absence of the disposition to calumniate,<br>exultation, satisfaction, rapture, humility, good behaviour, purity in<br>all acts having for their object the attainment of tranquillity,<br>righteous understanding, emancipation (from attachments), indifference,<br>Brahmacharyya, complete renunciation, freedom from the idea of meum,<br>freedom from expectations, unbroken observance of righteousness, belief<br>that gifts are vain, sacrifices are vain, study is vain, vows are vain,<br>acceptance of gifts is vain, observance of duties is vain, and penances<br>are vain&#8212;those Brahmanas in this world, whose conduct is marked by these<br>virtues, who adhere to righteousness, who abide in the Vedas, are said to<br>be wise and possessed of correctness of vision. Casting off all sins and<br>freed from grief, those men possessed of wisdom attain to Heaven and<br>create diverse bodies (for themselves). Attaining the power of governing<br>everything, self-restraint, minuteness, these high-souled ones make by<br>operations of their own mind, like the gods themselves dwelling in<br>Heaven. Such men are said to have their courses directed upwards. They<br>are veritable gods capable of modifying all things. Attaining to Heaven,<br>they modify all things by their very nature. They get whatever objects<br>they desire and enjoy them.[109] Thus have I, ye foremost of regenerate<br>ones, described to you what that conduct is which appertains to the<br>quality of goodness. Understanding these duly, one acquires whatever<br>objects one desires. The qualities that appertain to goodness have been<br>declared particularly. The conduct which those qualities constitute has<br>also been properly set forth. That man who always understands these<br>qualities, succeeds in enjoying the qualities without being attached to<br>them.'"
