                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Beholding those kings&#8212;lords of Earth&#8212;all<br>conversant with the Vedas, arrive, king Yudhishthira, addressing<br>Bhimasena, said,&#8212;'O chief of men, let proper honours be paid to these<br>kings who have come (to my sacrifice), for these foremost of men are all<br>worthy of the highest honours.' Thus addressed by king Yudhishthira of<br>great fame Pandu's son Bhimasena of mighty energy did as he was enjoined,<br>assisted by the twins. The foremost of all men, viz., Govinda, came<br>there, accompanied by the Vrishnis, and with Valadeva in the van. He was<br>accompanied by Yuyudhana and Pradyumna and Gada, and Nisatha and Samvo<br>and Kritavarman. The mighty car-warrior Bhima offered them the most<br>reverential worship. Those princes then entered the palaces, adorned with<br>gems, that were assigned to them. At the end of a conversation he had<br>with Yudhishthira, the slayer of Madhu referred to Arjuna who had been<br>emaciated in consequence of many fights. The son of Kunti repeatedly<br>asked Krishna, that chastiser of foes, about Arjuna. Unto Dharma's son,<br>the lord of all the universe began to speak about Jishnu, the son of<br>Sakra. 'O king, a confidential agent of mine residing in Dwaraka came to<br>me. He had seen Arjuna, that foremost of Pandu's sons. Indeed, the latter<br>has been very much emaciated with the fatigue of many battles. O puissant<br>monarch, that agent of mine informed me that the mighty-armed hero is<br>very near to us. Do thou set thyself to accomplish thy Horse-sacrifice.'<br>Thus addressed, king Yudhishthira the just, said unto him,&#8212;'By good<br>luck, O Madhava, Arjuna comes back safely. I desire to ascertain from<br>thee, O delighter of the Yadavas, what has been said in this matter by<br>that mightiest of heroes among the song of Pandu.' Thus addressed by king<br>Yudhishthira the just, the lord of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, that<br>foremost of eloquent men, said these words unto that monarch of righteous<br>soul,&#8212;'My agent, recollecting the words of Partha, reported them thus to<br>me, O great king,&#8212;Yudhishthira, O Krishna, should be told these words of<br>mine when the time comes. O chief of the Kauravas. many kings will come<br>(to thy sacrifice). When they arrive, high honours should be paid unto<br>them. This would, indeed, be worthy for us. O giver of honours, the king<br>should further be informed at my request that he should do what is<br>necessary for preventing a carnage similar to what took place at the time<br>of presenting the Arghya (on the occasion of the Rajasuya-sacrifice). Let<br>Krishna also approve of this. Let not. O king, through the ill-feeling of<br>kings, the people be slaughtered. My man further reported, O king, these<br>words of Dhananjaya. Listen as I repeat them, 'O monarch, the ruler of<br>Manipura, my dear son Vabhruvahana, will come at the sacrifice. Do thou<br>honour him duly for my sake. O puissant one. He is always attached and<br>deeply devoted to me.'&#8212;Hearing these words, king Yudhishthira the just,<br>approved of them and said as follows.'
