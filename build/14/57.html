                            "Vaisampayana said, "Beholding the king, who had become so, of frightful<br>mien, wearing a long beard smeared with the blood of human beings, the<br>Brahmana Utanka, O king, did not become agitated. That monarch of great<br>energy, inspiring terror in every breast and looking like a second Yama,<br>rising up, addressed Utanka, saying,&#8212;'By good luck, O best of Brahmanas,<br>thou hast come to me at the sixth hour of the day when I am in search of<br>food.'<br><br>"Utanka said, 'O king, know that I have come hither in course of my<br>wanderings for the sake of my preceptor. The wise have said that I while<br>one is employed for the sake of one's preceptor, one should not be<br>injured.'<br><br>"The king said, 'O best of Brahmanas, food has been ordained for me at<br>the sixth hour of the day. I am hungry. I cannot, therefore, allow thee<br>to escape today.'<br><br>"Utanka said, 'Let it be so, O king. Let this compact be made with me.<br>After I have ceased to wander for my preceptor, I shall once more come<br>and place myself within thy power. It has been heard by me, O best of<br>kings, that the object I seek for my preceptor is under thy control, O<br>monarch. Therefore, O ruler of men, I solicit thee for it. Thou daily<br>givest many foremost of gems unto superior Brahmanas. Thou art a giver, O<br>chief of men, from whom gifts may be accepted, know that I too am a<br>worthy object of charity present before thee, O best of kings. Having<br>accepted from thee in gift that object for my preceptor which is under<br>thy control, I shall, O king, in consequence of my compact, once more<br>come back to thee and place myself under thy power. I assure thee truly<br>of this. There is no falsehood in this. Never before have I spoken<br>anything untrue, no, not even in jest. What shall I say then of other<br>occasions?'<br><br>"Saudasa said, 'If the object thou seekest for thy preceptor is capable<br>of being placed in thy hands by me, if I be regarded as one from whom a<br>gift may be accepted, do thou then say what that object is.'<br><br>"Utanka said, 'O foremost of men, O Saudasa, in my estimation thou art a<br>worthy person from whom gifts may be accepted. I have, therefore, come to<br>thee for begging of thee the jewelled ear-rings (worn by thy queen).'<br><br>"Saudasa said, 'Those jewelled ear-rings, O learned and regenerate Rishi,<br>belong to my wife. They should be asked from her. Do thou, therefore,<br>solicit some other thing from me. I shall give it to thee, O thou of<br>excellent vows.'<br><br>"Utanka said, 'If we be regarded as any authority, do thou cease then to<br>urge this pretext. Do thou give those jewelled ear-rings to me. Be thou<br>truthful in speech, O king.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, the king once more addressed<br>Utanka and said unto him, 'Do thou, at my word, go to my venerable queen,<br>O best of men, and ask her, saying,&#8212;Give!&#8212;She of pure vows, thus<br>solicited by thee, will certainly, at my command, give thee, O foremost<br>of regenerate persons, those jewelled ear-rings of hers without doubt.'<br><br>"Utanka said, 'Whither, O ruler of men, shall I be able to meet thy<br>queen? Why dost thou not thyself go to her?'<br><br>"Saudasa said, 'Thou wilt find her today in the vicinity of a foremost<br>fountain. I cannot see her today as the sixth hour of the day has come.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, Utanka, O chief of Bharata's<br>race, then left that spot. Beholding Madayanti, he informed her of his<br>object. Hearing the command of Saudasa, that lady of large eyes replied<br>unto the highly intelligent Utanka, O Janamejaya, in these words: 'It is<br>even so, O regenerate one. Thou shouldst, however, O sinless one, assure<br>me that thou dost not say what is untrue. It behoves thee to bring me<br>some sign from my husband. These celestial ear-rings of mine, made of<br>costly gems, are such that the deities and Yakshas and great Rishis<br>always watch for opportunities for bearing them away. If placed at any<br>time on the Earth, this costly article would then be stolen by the Nagas.<br>If worn by one who is impure in consequence of eating, it would then be<br>taken away by the Yakshas. If the wearer falls asleep (without taking<br>care of these precious ear-rings) the deities would then take them away.<br>O best of Brahmanas, these ear-rings are capable of being taken away,<br>when such opportunities present themselves, by deities and Rakshasas and<br>Nagas, if worn by a heedless person. O best of regenerate ones, these<br>ear-rings, day and night, always produce gold. At night, they shine<br>brightly, attracting the rays of stars and constellations. O holy one, if<br>worn by any one, he would be freed from hunger and thirst and fear of<br>every kind. The wearer of these ear-rings is freed also from the fear of<br>poison and fire and every kind of danger. If worn by one of short<br>stature, these become short. If worn by one of tall stature, these grow<br>in size. Even of such virtues are these ear-rings of mine. They are<br>praised and honoured everywhere. Indeed, they are known over the three<br>worlds. Do thou, therefore, bring me some sign (from my husband).'"
