                            "Janamejaya said, 'It behoveth thee to tell me of any wonderful incident<br>that occurred in the sacrifice of my grandsires.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Hear, O chief of kings of a most wonderful incident<br>that occurred, O puissant monarch, at the conclusion of that great<br>horse-sacrifice. After all the foremost of Brahmanas and all the kinsmen<br>and relatives and friends, and all the poor, the blind, and the helpless<br>ones had been gratified, O chief of Bharata's race, when the gifts made<br>in profusion were being spoken of on all sides, indeed, when flowers were<br>rained down on the head of king Yudhishthira the just, a blue-eyed<br>mongoose, O sinless one, with one side of his body changed into gold,<br>came there and spoke in a voice that was as loud and deep as thunder.<br>Repeatedly uttering such deep sounds and thereby frightening all animals<br>and birds, that proud denizen of a hole, with large body, spoke in a<br>human voice and said, 'Ye kings, this great sacrifice is not equal to a<br>prastha of powdered barley given away by a liberal Brahmana of<br>Kurukshetra who was observing the Unccha vow.' Hearing these words of the<br>mongoose, O king, all those foremost of Brahmanas became filled with<br>wonder. Approaching the mongoose, they then asked him, saying, 'Whence<br>hast thou come to this sacrifice, this resort of the good and the pious?<br>What is the extent of thy might? What thy learning? And what thy refuge?<br>How should we know thee that thus censurest this our sacrifice? Without<br>having disregarded any portion of the scriptures, everything that should<br>be done has been accomplished here according to the scriptures and<br>agreeably to reason, with the aid of diverse sacrificial rites. Those who<br>are deserving of worship have been duly worshipped here according to the<br>way pointed out by the scriptures. Libations have been poured on the<br>sacred fire with the aid of proper mantras. That which should be given<br>has been given away without pride. The regenerate class have been<br>gratified with gifts of diverse kinds. The Kshatriyas have been gratified<br>with battles fought according to just methods. The grandsires have been<br>gratified with Sraddhas. The Vaisyas have been gratified by the<br>protection offered to them, and many foremost of women have been<br>gratified by accomplishing their desires. The Sudras have been gratified<br>by kind speeches, and others with the remnants of the profuse wealth<br>collected on the spot. Kinsmen and relatives have been gratified by the<br>purity of behaviour displayed by our king. The deities have been<br>gratified by libations of clarified butter and acts of merit, and<br>dependants and followers by protection. That therefore, which is true, do<br>thou truly declare unto these Brahmanas. Indeed, do thou declare what is<br>agreeable to the scriptures and to actual experience, asked by the<br>Brahmanas who are eager to know. Thy words seem to demand credit. Thou<br>art wise. Thou bearest also a celestial form. Thou hast come into the<br>midst of learned Brahmanas. It behoveth thee to explain thyself.' Thus<br>addressed by those regenerate persons, the mongoose, smiling, answered<br>them as follows. 'Ye regenerate ones, the words I have uttered are not<br>false. Neither have I spoken them from pride. That which I have said may<br>have been heard by you all. Ye foremost of regenerate persons, this<br>sacrifice is not equal in merit to the gift of a prastha of powdered<br>barley. Without doubt, I should say this, ye foremost of Brahmanas.<br>Listen to me with undivided attention as I narrate what happened to thee<br>truly. Wonderful and excellent was the occurrence that fell out. It was<br>witnessed by me and its consequences were felt by me. The incident<br>relates to a liberal Brahmana dwelling in Kurukshetra in the observance<br>of the Unccha vow. In consequence of that incident he attained to Heaven,<br>ye regenerate ones, along with his wife and son and daughter-in-law. And<br>in consequence of what then happened half my body became transformed into<br>gold.'<br><br>"The Mongoose continued, 'Ye regenerate ones, I shall presently tell you<br>what the excellent fruit was of the gift, made by a Brahmana, of a very<br>little measure (of powdered barley) obtained by lawful means. On that<br>righteous spot of ground known by the name of Kurukshetra, which is the<br>abode of many righteous persons, there lived a Brahmana in the observance<br>of what is called the Unccha vow. That mode of living is like unto that<br>of the pigeon.[214] He lived there with his wife and son and<br>daughter-in-law and practised penances. Of righteous soul, and with<br>senses under complete control, he adopted the mode of living that is<br>followed by a parrot. Of excellent vows, he used to eat everyday at the<br>sixth division.[215] If there was nothing to eat at the sixth division of<br>the day, that excellent Brahmana would fast for that day and eat the next<br>day at the sixth division. On one occasion, ye Brahmanas, there occurred<br>a dreadful famine in the land. During that time there was nothing stored<br>in the abode of that righteous Brahmana. The herbs and plants were all<br>dried up and the whole realm became void of foodstore. When the<br>accustomed hours came for eating, the Brahmana had nothing to eat. This<br>occurred day after day. All the members of his family were afflicted with<br>hunger but were obliged to pass the days as best they could. One day, in<br>the month of Jaishtha, while the Sun was in the meridian, the Brahmana<br>was engaged in picking up grains of corn. Afflicted by heat and hunger,<br>he was practising even this penance. Unable to obtain grains of corn, the<br>Brahmana soon became worn out with hunger and toil. Indeed, with all the<br>members of his family, he had no food to eat. That best of Brahmanas<br>passed the days in great suffering. One day, after the sixth division<br>came, he succeeded in obtaining a prastha of barley. That barley was then<br>reduced by those ascetics to powder for making what is called Saktu of<br>it. Having finished their silent recitations and other daily rites, and<br>having duly poured libations on the sacred fire, those ascetics divided<br>that little measure of powdered barley amongst themselves so that the<br>share of each came up to the measure of a Kudava.[216] As they were about<br>to sit down for eating, there came unto their abode a guest. Beholding<br>the person who came as a guest, all of them became exceedingly glad.<br>Indeed, seeing him, they saluted him and made the usual enquiries of<br>welfare. They were of pure minds, self-restrained, and endued with faith<br>and control over the passions. Freed from malice, they had conquered<br>wrath. Possessed of piety, they were never pained at the sight of other<br>people's happiness. They had cast off pride and haughtiness and anger.<br>Indeed, they were conversant with every duty, ye foremost of regenerate<br>ones. Informing their guest of their own penances and of the race or<br>family to which they belonged, and ascertaining from him in return those<br>particulars, they caused that hungry guest of theirs to enter their<br>cottage. Addressing him they said, 'This is the Arghya for thee. This<br>water is for washing thy feet. There are scattered some Kusa grass for<br>thy seat, O sinless one. Here is some clean Saktu acquired by lawful<br>means, O puissant one. Given by us, O foremost of regenerate persons, do<br>thou accept it,' Thus addressed by them, that Brahmana accepted the<br>Kudava of powdered barley that was offered to him and ate it all. But his<br>hunger, O king, was not appeased by what he ate. The Brahmana in the<br>observance of the Unccha vow, seeing that his guest's hunger was still<br>unappeased, began to think of what other food he could place before him<br>for gratifying him. Then his wife said unto him,&#8212;'Let my share be given<br>unto him. Let this foremost of regenerate persons be gratified and let<br>him then go whithersoever he will.' Knowing that his chaste wife who said<br>so was herself afflicted by hunger, that best of Brahmanas could not<br>approve of her share of the powdered barley being given to the guest.<br>Indeed, that best of Brahmanas possessed of learning, knowing from his<br>own state that his aged, toil-worn, cheerless, and helpless wife was<br>herself afflicted by hunger and seeing that lady who had been emaciated<br>into mere skin and bone was quivering with weakness, addressed her and<br>said, 'O beautiful one, with even animals, with even worms and insects,<br>wives are fed and protected. It behoveth thee not, therefore, to say so.<br>The wife treats her lord with kindness and feeds and protects him.<br>Everything appertaining to religion, pleasure, and wealth, careful<br>nursing, offspring for perpetuating the race, are all dependent on the<br>wife. Indeed, the merits of a person himself as also of his deceased<br>ancestors depend also on her. The wife should know her lord by his acts.<br>Verily, that man who fails to protect his wife earns great infamy here<br>and goes into Hell hereafter. Such a man falls down from even a position<br>of great fame and never succeeds in acquiring regions of happiness<br>hereafter.' Thus addressed, she answered him, saying, 'O regenerate one,<br>our religious acts and wealth are united. Do thou take a fourth of this<br>barley. Indeed, be gratified with me. Truth, pleasure, religious merit,<br>and Heaven as acquirable, by good qualities, of women, as also all the<br>objects of their desire, O foremost of regenerate ones, are dependent on<br>the husband. In the production of offspring the mother contributes her<br>blood. The father contributes his seed. The husband is the highest deity<br>of the wife. Through the grace of the husband, women obtain both pleasure<br>and offspring as the reward. Thou art my Pati (lord) for the protection<br>thou givest me. Thou art my Bhartri for the means of sustenance thou<br>givest me. Thou art, again, boon-giver to me in consequence of thy having<br>presented me a son. Do thou, therefore, (in return for so many favours),<br>take my share of the barley and give it unto the guest. Overcome by<br>decrepitude, thou art of advanced years. Afflicted by hunger thou art<br>exceedingly weakened. Worn out with fasts, thou art very much emaciated.<br>(If thou couldst part with thy share, why should not I part with mine)'<br>Thus addressed by her, he took her share of the powdered barley and<br>addressing his guest said,&#8212;'O regenerate one, O best of men, do thou<br>accept this measure of powdered barley as well.' The Brahmana, having<br>accepted that quantity, immediately ate it up, but his hunger was not yet<br>appeased. Beholding him ungratified, the Brahmana in the observance of<br>the Unccha vow became thoughtful. His son then said unto him, 'O best of<br>men, taking my share of the barely do thou give it to the guest. I regard<br>this act of mine as one of great merit. Therefore, do it. Thou shouldst<br>be always maintained by me with great care. Maintenance of the father is<br>a duty which the good always covet. The maintenance of the father in his<br>old age is the duty ordained for the son. Even this is the eternal sruti<br>(audition) current in the three worlds, O learned Rishi. By barely living<br>thou art capable of practising penances. The life-breath is the great<br>deity that resides in the bodies of all embodied creatures.'[217]<br><br>"The father, at this, said, 'If thou attainest to the age of even a<br>thousand years, thou wilt still seem to me to be only a little child.<br>Having begotten a son, the sire achieves success through him. O puissant<br>one, I know that the hunger of children is very strong. I am old. I shall<br>somehow succeed in holding my life-breaths. Do thou, O son, become strong<br>(by eating the food that has fallen to thy share). Old and decrepit as I<br>am, O son, hunger scarcely afflicts me. I have, again, for many years,<br>practised penances. I have no fear of death.'<br><br>"The son said, 'I am thy offspring. The Sruti declares that one's<br>offspring is called putra because one is rescued by him. One's own self,<br>again, takes birth as one's son. Do thou, therefore, rescue thyself by<br>thy own self (in the form of thy son).'<br><br>"The father said, 'In form thou art like me. In conduct and in<br>self-restraint also thou art my like. Thou hast been examined on various<br>occasions by me. I shall, therefore, accept thy share of the barley, O<br>son.' Having said this, that foremost of regenerate persons cheerfully<br>took his son's share of the barley and smilingly presented it to his<br>regenerate guest. Having eaten that barley also, the guest's hunger was<br>not appeased. The righteous-souled host in the observance of the unccha<br>vow became ashamed (at the thought that he had nothing more to give).<br>Desirous of doing what was agreeable to him, his chaste daughter-in-law<br>then, bearing her share of the barley, approached him and said, 'Through<br>thy son, O learned Brahmana, I shall obtain a son. Do thou, therefore,<br>take my share of the barley and give it unto this guest. Through thy<br>grace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through<br>the grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to<br>endure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with<br>Religion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple<br>aggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,<br>and the great-grandson. The son is called Putra because he frees his<br>sires from debt. Through sons and grandsons one always enjoys the<br>happiness of those regions which are reserved for the pious and the good.'<br><br>"The father-in-law said, 'O thou of excellent vows and conduct, beholding<br>thee wasted by wind and sun, deprived of thy very complexion, emaciated<br>and almost destitute of consciousness through hunger, how can I be such a<br>transgressor against the rules of righteousness as to take thy share of<br>the barley? O auspicious damsel, it behoves thee not to say so, for the<br>sake of those auspicious results for which every family must strive.[218]<br>O auspicious damsel, how can I behold thee: at even this, the sixth<br>division of the day, abstaining from food and observing vows? Thou art<br>endued with purity and good conduct and penances. Alas, even thou hast to<br>pass thy days in so much misery. Thou art a child, afflicted by hunger,<br>and belongest to the softer sex. Thou shouldst be always protected by me.<br>Alas, I have to see thee worn out with fasts, O thou that art the<br>delighter of all thy kinsmen.'<br><br>"The daughter-in-law said, 'Thou art the senior of my senior since thou<br>art the deity of my deity. Thou art verily the god of my god. Do thou,<br>therefore, O puissant one, take my share of the barley. My body,<br>life-breaths, and religious rites have all one purpose viz., the service<br>of my senior. Through thy grace, O learned Brahmana, I shall obtain many<br>regions of happiness hereafter. I deserve to be looked after by thee.<br>Know, O regenerate one, that I am wholly devoted to thee. Cherishing also<br>this thought, viz., that my happiness is thy concern, it behoveth thee to<br>take this my share of the barley.'<br><br>"The father-in-law said, 'O chaste lady, in consequence of such conduct<br>of thine thou wilt for ever shine in glory, for endued with vows and<br>steadiness in religious rites, thy eyes are directed to that conduct<br>which should be observed towards seniors. Therefore, O daughter-in-law, I<br>shall take thy share of the barley. Thou deservest not to be deceived by<br>me, reckoning all thy virtues. Thou art truly, O blessed damsel, the<br>foremost of all persons observing the duties of righteousness.' Having<br>said so unto her, the Brahmana took her share of the barley and gave it<br>unto his guest. At this the guest became gratified with the high-souled<br>Brahmana endued with great piety. With gratified soul, that first of<br>regenerate person, possessed of great eloquence, who was none else than<br>the deity of Righteousness in a human form, then addressed that foremost<br>of Brahmanas and said, 'O best of regenerate ones, I am exceedingly<br>gratified with this pure gift of thine, this gift of what was acquired by<br>lawful means by thee, and which thou didst freely part with, agreeably to<br>the rules of righteousness. Verily, this gift of thine is being bruited<br>about in Heaven by the denizens of that happy region. Behold, flowers<br>have been rained down from the firmament on the Earth. The celestial<br>Rishis, the deities, the Gandharvas, those who walk before the deities,<br>and the celestial messengers, are all praising thee, struck with wonder<br>at thy gift. The regenerate Rishis who dwell in the regions of Brahma,<br>seated on their cars, are solicitous of obtaining thy sight. O foremost<br>of regenerate persons, go to Heaven. The Pitris residing in their own<br>region have all been rescued by thee. Others also who have not attained<br>to the position of Pitris have equally been rescued by thee for countless<br>Yugas. For thy Brahmacharyya, thy gifts, thy sacrifices, thy penances,<br>and thy acts of piety done with a pure heart, go thou to Heaven. O thou<br>of excellent vows, thou practisest penances with great devotion. Thy<br>gifts have, therefore, gratified the deities highly, O best of regenerate<br>ones. Since thou hast made this gift, in a season of great difficulty,<br>with a pure heart, thou hast, by this act of thine, conquered Heaven.<br>Hunger destroys one's wisdom and drives off one's righteous<br>understanding. One whose intelligence is overwhelmed by hunger casts off<br>all fortitude. He, therefore, that conquers hunger conquers Heaven<br>without doubt. One's righteousness is never destroyed as long as one<br>cherishes the inclination of making gifts. Disregarding filial affection,<br>disregarding the affection one feels for one's wife, and reckoning<br>righteousness as the foremost, thou hast paid no heed to the cravings of<br>nature. The acquisition of wealth is an act of slight merit. Its gift to<br>a deserving person is fraught with greater merit. Of still greater merit<br>is the (proper) time. Lastly, devotion (in the matter of gift) is fraught<br>with the highest merit. The door of Heaven is very difficult to see.<br>Through heedlessness men fail to obtain a sight of it. The bar of<br>Heaven's door has cupidity for its seed. That bar is kept fastened by<br>desire and affection. Verily, Heaven's door is unapproachable. Those men<br>who subdued wrath and conquered their passions, those Brahmanas who are<br>endued with penances and who make gifts according to the measure of their<br>ability, succeed in beholding it. It has been said that he that gives<br>away a hundred, having a thousand, he that gives away ten, having a<br>hundred, and he that gives a handful of water, having no wealth, are all<br>equal in respect of the merit they earn. King Rantideva, when divested of<br>all his wealth, gave a small quantity of water with a pure heart. Through<br>this gift, O learned Brahmana, he went to Heaven. The deity of<br>righteousness is never gratified so much with large gifts of costly<br>things as with gifts of even things of no value, if acquired lawfully and<br>given away with devotion and faith. King Nriga had made gifts of<br>thousands of kine unto the regenerate class. By giving away only one cow<br>that did not belong to him, he fell into Hell. Usinara's son Sivi of<br>excellent vows, by giving away the flesh of his own body, is rejoicing in<br>Heaven, having attained to the regions of the righteous. Mere wealth is<br>not merit. Good men acquire merit by exerting to the best of their power<br>and with the aid of pious meals. One does not acquire such merit by means<br>of even diverse sacrifices as with even a little wealth that has been<br>earned lawfully. Through wrath, the fruits of gifts are destroyed.<br>Through cupidity one fails to go to Heaven. One conversant with the<br>merits of gift, and leading a just course of conduct succeeds, through<br>penances, in enjoying Heaven. The fruit, O Brahmana, of this gift made by<br>thee (of a prastha of powdered barley) is much greater than what one<br>acquires by many Rajasuya sacrifices with profuse gifts or many<br>Horse-sacrifices. With this prastha of powdered barley thou hast<br>conquered the eternal region of Brahman. Go thou in happiness, O learned<br>Brahmana, to the abode of Brahman that is without the stain of darkness.<br>O foremost of regenerate persons, a celestial car is here for all of you.<br>Do thou ascend it as pleasest thee, O Brahmana, I am the deity of<br>Righteousness. Behold me! Thou hast rescued thy body. The fame of thy<br>achievement will last in the world. With thy wife, thy son, and thy<br>daughter-in-law, go now to Heaven.'&#8212;After the deity of Righteousness had<br>said these words, that Brahmana, with his wife, son and daughter-in-law,<br>proceeded to Heaven. After that learned Brahmana, conversant with all<br>duties, had thus ascended to Heaven with his son, daughter-in-law, and<br>wife numbering the fourth, I came out of my hole. There with the scent of<br>that powdered barley, with the mire caused by the water (which the<br>Brahmana had given to his guest), with the contact (of my body) with the<br>celestial flowers that had been rained down, with the particles of the<br>barley-powder which that good man had given away, and the penances of<br>that Brahmana, my head became gold, Behold, in consequence of the gift of<br>that Brahmana who was firm in truth, and his penances, half of this my<br>ample body has become golden. Ye regenerate ones, for converting the rest<br>of my body into gold I repeatedly repair, with a cheerful heart, to the<br>retreats of ascetics and the sacrifices performed by kings. Hearing of<br>this sacrifice of the Kuru king endued with great wisdom, I came hither<br>with high hopes. I have not, however, been made gold. Ye foremost of<br>Brahmanas, it was for this that I uttered those words, viz., that this<br>sacrifice can by no means compare with (the gift of) that prastha of<br>powdered barley. With the grains of that prastha of powdered barley, I<br>was made gold on that occasion. This great sacrifice however, is not<br>equal to those grains. Even this is my opinion.' Having said those words<br>unto all those foremost of Brahmanas, the mongoose disappeared from their<br>sight. Those Brahmanas then returned to their respective homes.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'O conquerer of hostile towns, I have now told<br>thee all relating to that wonderful incident which occurred in that great<br>Horse-sacrifice. Thou shouldst not, O king, think highly of sacrifice.<br>Millions of Rishis have ascended to Heaven with the aid of only their<br>penances. Abstention from injury as regards all creatures, contentment,<br>conduct, sincerity, penances, self-restraint, truthfulness, and gifts are<br>each equal in point of merit to sacrifice."'
