                            "Vaisampayana said, 'That lady of eyes like lotus petals, having indulged<br>in copious lamentations, and burning with grief, at last lost her senses<br>and fell down on the Earth. Regaining consciousness and seeing Ulupi, the<br>daughter of the snake chief, queen Chitrangada endued with celestial<br>beauty, said unto her these words, 'Behold. O Ulupi, our ever-victorious<br>husband slain in battle, through thee, by my son of tender years. Art<br>thou conversant with the practices of the respectable? Art thou a wife<br>devoted to thy lord? It is through thy deed that thy husband is laid low,<br>slain in battle. If Dhananjaya hath offended against thee in every<br>respect, do thou forgive him I solicit thee, do thou revive that hero. O<br>righteous lady, thou art conversant with piety. Thou art, O blessed one,<br>known (for thy virtues) over the three worlds. How is it that having<br>caused thy husband to be slain by my son, thou dost not indulge in grief?<br>O daughter of the snake chief, I do not grieve for my slain son. I grieve<br>for only my husband who has received this hospitality from his son.'<br>Having said these words unto the queenly Ulupi, the daughter of the snake<br>chief, the illustrious Chitrangada proceeded to where her husband lay on<br>the Earth and addressing him, said, 'Rise, O dear lord, thou occupiest<br>the foremost place in the affections of the Kuru king (Yudhishthira).<br>Here is that steed of thine. It has been set free by me. Verily, O<br>puissant one, this sacrificial steed of king Yudhishthira the just,<br>should be followed by thee. Why then dost thou lie still on the Earth? My<br>life-breaths depend on thee, O delighter of the Kurus. How is it that he<br>who is the giver of other people's life-breaths casts off his own<br>life-breaths today? Behold, O Ulupi, this goodly sight of thy husband<br>lying prostrate on the ground. How is it that thou dost not grieve,<br>having caused him to be slain through my son when thou didst excite with<br>thy words? It is fit that this boy should succumb to the power of death<br>and lie thus on the ground beside his own sire. Oh, let Vijaya, let him<br>that is called Gudakesa, let this hero with reddish eyes, come back O<br>life. O blessed lady, polygamy is not fault with men. Women only incur<br>fault by taking more than one husband. Do not, therefore, harbour such<br>thoughts (of vengeance).[196] This relationship was ordained by the<br>Supreme ordainer himself. It is, besides, an eternal and unchangeable<br>one. Do thou attend to that relationship. Let thy union (with Dhananjaya)<br>be made true. If, having slain thy husband through my son, thou dost not<br>revive him today before my eyes, I shall then cast off my life-breaths.<br>Without doubt, O reverend lady, afflicted as I am with grief and deprived<br>as I am of both husband and son, I shall sit here today in Praya in thy<br>very sight!' Having said so unto the daughter of the snake chief, who was<br>a co-wife with her to Arjuna, the princess Chaitravahini sat in Praya, O<br>king, restraining speech.'[197]<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Ceasing to lament, the cheerless queen, taking<br>upon her lap the feet of her husband, sat there, sighing heavily and<br>wishing also the restoration of her son to life. King Vabhruvahana then,<br>regaining consciousness, saw his mother seated in that guise on the field<br>of battle. Addressing her he said, 'What can be more painful than the<br>sight of my mother, who has been brought up in luxury, lying on the bare<br>ground beside her heroic husband stretched thereon? Alas, this slayer of<br>all foes, this foremost of all wielders of weapons, hath been slain by me<br>in battle, It is evident that men do not die till their hour comes.[198]<br>Oh, the heart of this princess seems to be very hard since it does not<br>break even at the sight of her mighty-armed and broad-chested husband<br>lying dead on the ground. It is evident that one does not die till one's<br>hour comes, since neither myself, nor my mother is deprived of life (at<br>even such a sight). Alas, alas, the golden coat of mail of this foremost<br>hero of Kuru's race, slain by me, his son, knowingly, is lying on the<br>ground, cut off from his body. Alas, ye Brahmanas, behold my heroic sire<br>lying prostrate on the Earth, on a hero's bed, slain by his son. What<br>benefit is done to this hero, slain by me in battle, by those Brahmanas<br>who were commissioned to attend upon this foremost one of Kuru's race<br>engaged in following the steed? Let the Brahmanas direct what expiation<br>should now be undergone by me, a cruel and sinful wretch, that has slain<br>his own sire in battle. Having slain my own sire, I should, suffering<br>every kind of misery, wander over the Earth, cruel that I am, covering<br>myself with his skin. Give me the two halves of my sire's head to day,<br>(so that I may wander over the Earth with them for that period), for<br>there is no other expiation for me that have slain my own sire. Behold, O<br>daughter of the foremost of snakes, thy husband slain by me. Verily, by<br>slaying Arjuna in battle I have accomplished what is agreeable to thee. I<br>shall today follow in the track by which my sire has gone. O blessed one,<br>I am unable to comfort myself. Be happy today, O mother, seeing myself<br>and the wielder of Gandiva both embrace death today. I swear to thee by<br>truth itself (that I shall castoff my life-breaths).' Having said these<br>words, the king, deeply afflicted with grief, O monarch, touched water,<br>and exclaimed in sorrow, 'Let all creatures, mobile and immobile, listen<br>to me. Do thou also listen to me, O mother. I say the truth, O best of<br>all daughters of the snakes. If this best of men, Jaya, my sire, does not<br>rise up, I shall emaciate my own body, sitting on the field of battle.<br>Having slain my sire, there is no rescue for me (from that dire sin).<br>Afflicted as I am with the sin of slaying my sire, I shall without doubt<br>have to sink in Hell. By slaying a heroic Kshatriya one becomes cleansed<br>by making a gift of a hundred kine. By slaying my sire, however, so dire<br>has been my sin that my I rescue is impossible. This Dhananjaya, the son<br>of Pandu, was the one hero endued with mighty energy. Possessed of<br>righteous soul, he was the author of my being. How can I be rescued after<br>having slain him? Having uttered these lamentations, the high-souled son<br>of Dhananjaya, king Vabhruvahana, touched water and became silent, vowing<br>to starve himself to death.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'When the king of Manipura, that chastiser of<br>foes, afflicted with grief, along with his mother, sat down to starve<br>himself to death, Ulupi then thought of the gem that has the virtue of<br>reviving a dead man. The gem, the great refuge of the snakes, thus<br>thought of, came there. The daughter of the prince of snakes taking it<br>up, uttered these words that highly gladdened the combatants standing on<br>the field. 'Rise up, O son. Do not grieve. Jishnu has not been vanquished<br>by thee. This hero is incapable of being vanquished by men as also by the<br>deities with Vasava himself at their head I have exhibited this illusion,<br>deceiving your senses, for the benefit of this foremost of men, viz., thy<br>illustrious sire. O thou of Kuru's race, desirous of ascertaining the<br>prowess of thyself, his son, this slayer of hostile heroes, O king, came<br>here for battling with thee. It was for that reason, O son, that thou<br>wert urged by me to do battle. O puissant king, O son, do not suspect<br>that thou hast committed any, even the least, fault, by accepting his<br>challenge. He is a Rishi, of a mighty soul, eternal and indestructible. O<br>dear son, Sakra himself is incapable of vanquishing him in battle. This<br>celestial gem has been brought by me, O king. It always revives the<br>snakes as often as they die. O puissant king, do thou place this gem on<br>the breast of thy sire. Thou shalt then see the son of Pandu revived.'<br>Thus addressed, the prince who had committed no sin, moved by affection<br>for his sire, then placed that gem on the breast of Pritha's son of<br>immeasurable energy. After the gem had been placed on his breast; the<br>heroic and puissant Jishnu became revived. Opening his red eyes he rose<br>up like one who had slept long. Beholding his sire, the high-souled hero<br>of great energy, restored to consciousness and quite at his ease,<br>Vabhruvahana worshipped him with reverence. When that tiger among men, O<br>puissant one, awoke from the slumber of death with every auspicious sign<br>of life, the chastiser of Paka rained down celestial flowers.<br>Kettle-drums struck by nobody, produced their music deep as the roar of<br>the cloud. A loud uproar was heard in the welkin consisting of the<br>words&#8212;Excellent, Excellent! The mighty-armed Dhananjaya, rising up and<br>well-comforted, embraced Vabhruvahana and smelled his head. He saw<br>sitting at a distance from his son, this latter's mother afflicted with<br>grief, in the company of Ulupi. Dhananjaya asked,&#8212;'Why is it that every<br>thing in the field of battle seems to bear the indications of grief,<br>wonder, and joy? If, O slayer of foes, the cause is known to thee, do<br>thou then tell me. Why has thy mother come to the field of battle? Why<br>also has Ulupi, the daughter of the prince of snakes, come here? I know<br>that thou hadst fought this battle with me at my own command. I desire to<br>know what the cause is that has brought out the ladies.' The intelligent<br>ruler of Manipura, thug questioned by Dhananjaya, gratified him by<br>bending his head in reverence, and then said,&#8212;'Let Ulupi be questioned.'
