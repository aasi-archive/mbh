                            "The Brahmana's wife said, 'This is incapable of being understood by a<br>person of little intelligence as also by one whose soul has not been<br>cleansed. My intelligence is very little, and contracted, and confused.<br>Do thou tell me the means by which the knowledge (of which thou speakest)<br>may be acquired. I wish to learn from thee the source from which this<br>knowledge flows.'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'Know that intelligence devoted to Brahman, is the<br>lower Arani; the preceptor is the upper Arani; penances and conversance<br>wit tithe scriptures are to cause the attrition. From this is produced<br>the fire of knowledge.'<br><br>"The Brahmana's wife said, 'As regards this symbol of Brahman, which is<br>designated Kshetrajna, where, indeed, occurs a description of it by which<br>it is capable of being seized?'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'He is without symbols, and without qualities.<br>Nothing exists that may be regarded as his cause. I shall, however, tell<br>thee the means by which he can be seized or not. A good means may be<br>found; viz., perception of hearing, etc. as flowers are perceived by<br>bees. That means consists of an understanding cleansed by action. Those<br>whose understandings have not been so cleansed, regard that entity,<br>through their own ignorance, as invested with the properties of knowledge<br>and others.[97] It is not laid down that this should be done, of that<br>this should not be done, in the rules for achieving Emancipation,&#8212;those,<br>that is, in which a knowledge of the soul arises only in him who sees and<br>hears.[98] One should comprehend as many parts, unmanifest and manifest<br>by hundreds and thousands, as one is capable of comprehending here.<br>Indeed, one should comprehend diverse objects of diverse import, and all<br>objects of direct perception. Then will come, from practice (of<br>contemplation and self-restraint, etc.), that above which nothing<br>exists.'[99]<br><br>"The holy one continued, 'Then the mind of that Brahmana's wife, upon the<br>destruction of the Kshetrajna, became that which is beyond Kshetrajna, in<br>consequence of the knowledge of Kshetra.'[100]<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'Where, indeed, is that Brahmana's wife, O Krishna, and<br>where is that foremost of Brahmanas, by both of whom was such success<br>attained. Do thou, tell me about them, O thou of unfading glory.'<br><br>"The blessed and holy one said, 'Know that my mind is the Brahmana, and<br>that my understanding is the Brahmana's wife. He who has been spoken of<br>as Kshetrajna is I myself, O Dhananjaya!"'
