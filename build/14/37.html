                            "Brahman said, 'Ye best of beings, I shall now declare to you accurately<br>what (the quality of) Passion is. Ye highly blessed ones, do you<br>understand what those qualities are that appertain to Passion, Injuring<br>(others), beauty, toil, pleasure and pain, cold and heat, lordship (or<br>power), war, peace, arguments, dissatisfaction, endurance,[107] might,<br>valour, pride, wrath, exertion, quarrel (or collision), jealousy, desire,<br>malice, battle, the sense of meum or mineness, protection (of others),<br>slaughter, bonds, and affliction, buying and selling, lopping off,<br>cutting, piercing and cutting off the coat of mail that another has<br>worn,[108] fierceness, cruelty, villifying, pointing out the faults of<br>others, thoughts entirely devoted to worldly affairs, anxiety, animosity,<br>reviling of others, false speech, false or vain gifts, hesitancy and<br>doubt, boastfulness of speech, dispraise and praise, laudation, prowess,<br>defiance, attendance (as on the sick and the weak), obedience (to the<br>commands of preceptors and parents), service or ministrations, harbouring<br>of thirst or desire, cleverness or dexterity of conduct, policy<br>heedlessness, contumely, possessions, and diverse decorations that<br>prevail in the world among men, women, animals, inanimate things, houses,<br>grief, incredulousness, vows and regulations, actions with expectation<br>(of good result), diverse acts of public charity, the rites in respect of<br>Swaha salutations, rites of Swadha and Vashat, officiating at the<br>sacrifices of others, imparting of instruction, performance of<br>sacrifices, study, making of gifts, acceptance of gifts, rites of<br>expiation, auspicious acts, the wish to have this and that, affection<br>generated by the merits of the object for which or whom it is felt,<br>treachery, deception, disrespect and respect, theft, killing, desire of<br>concealment, vexation, wakefulness, ostentation, haughtiness, attachment,<br>devotion, contentment, exultation, gambling, indulgence in scandal, all<br>relations arising out of women, attachment to dancing, instrumental music<br>and songs&#8212;all these qualities, ye learned Brahmanas, have been said to<br>belong to Passion. Those men on Earth who meditate on the past, present,<br>and the future, who are devoted to the aggregate of three, viz.,<br>Religion, Wealth, and Pleasure, who acting from impulse of desire, exult<br>on attaining to affluence in respect of every desire, are said to be<br>enveloped by Passion. These men have downward courses. Repeatedly reborn<br>in this world, they give themselves up to pleasure. They covet what<br>belongs to this world as also all those fruit, that belong to the world<br>hereafter. They make gifts, accept gifts, offer oblations to the Pitris,<br>and pour libations on the sacrificial fire. The qualities of Passion have<br>(thus) been declared to you in their variety. The course of conduct also<br>to which it leads has been properly described to you. The man who always<br>understands these qualities, succeeds in always freeing himself from all<br>of them which appertain to Passion.'"
