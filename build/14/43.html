                            "Brahmana said, 'Among men, the royal Kshatriya is (endued with) the<br>middle quality. Among vehicles, the elephant (is so); and among denizens<br>of the forest the lion; among all (sacrificial) animals, the sheep; among<br>all those that live in holes, is the snake; among cattle, the bovine<br>bull; among females, the mule.[125] There is no doubt in this that in<br>this world, the Nyagrodha, the Jamvu, the Pippala, the Salmali, and<br>Sinsapa, the Meshasringa, and the Kichaka, are the foremost ones among<br>trees.[126] Himavat, Patipatra, Sahya, Vindhya, Trikutavat, Sweta, Nila,<br>Bhasa, Koshthavat, Guruskandha, Mahendra and Malayavat,&#8212;these are the<br>foremost of mountains. Likewise the Maruts are the foremost of the Ganas.<br>Surya is the lord of all the planets, and Chandramas of all the<br>constellations. Yama is the lord of the Pitris; Ocean is the lord of all<br>rivers. Varuna is the king of the waters. Indra is said to be the king of<br>the Maruts. Arka is the king of all hot bodies, and Indra of all luminous<br>bodies. Agni is the eternal lord of the elements, and Vrihaspati of the<br>Brahmanas. Soma is the lord of (deciduous) herbs, and Vishnu is the<br>foremost of all that are endued with might. Tashtri is the king of<br>Rudras, and Siva of all creatures. Sacrifice is the foremost of all<br>initiatory rites, and Maghavat of the deities. The North is the lord of<br>all the points of the compass; Soma of great energy is the lord of all<br>learned Brahmanas. Kuvera is the lord of all precious gems, and Purandara<br>of all the deities. Such is the highest creation among all entities.<br>Prajapati is the lord of all creatures. Of all entities whatever, I, who<br>am full of Brahman, am the foremost. There is no entity that is higher<br>than myself or Vishnu. The great Vishnu, who is full of Brahman, is the<br>king of kings over all. Know him to be the ruler, the creator, the<br>uncreated Hari. He is the ruler of men and Kinnaras and Yakshas and<br>Gandharvas, and Snakes and Rakshasas, and deities and Danavas and Nagas.<br>Among those that are followed by persons full of desire is the great<br>goddess Maheswari of beautiful eyes. She is otherwise called by the name<br>of Parvati. Know that the goddess Uma is the foremost and the most<br>auspicious of women. Among women that are a source of pleasure, the<br>foremost are the Apsaras who are possessed of great splendour.[127] Kings<br>are desirous of acquiring piety, and Brahmanas are causeways of piety.<br>Therefore, the king should always strive to protect the twice-born ones.<br>Those kings in whose dominions good men languish are regarded as bereft<br>of the virtues of their order. Hereafter they have to go into wrong<br>paths. Those kings in whose dominions good men are protected, rejoice in<br>this world and enjoy happiness hereafter. Verily, those high-souled ones<br>attain to the highest seat. Understand this, ye foremost of regenerate<br>ones. I shall after this state the everlasting indications of duties.<br>Abstention from injury is the highest duty. Injury is an indication of<br>unrighteousness. Splendour is the indication of the deities. Men have<br>acts for their indications. Ether (or space) has sound for its<br>characteristic. Wind has touch for its characteristic. The characteristic<br>of lighted bodies is colour, and water has taste for its characteristic.<br>Earth, which holds all entities, has smell for its characteristic. Speech<br>has words for its characteristic, refined into vowels and consonants.<br>Mind has thought for its characteristic. Thought has, again, been said to<br>be the characteristic of the understanding. The things thought of by the<br>mind are ascertained with accuracy by the understanding. There is no<br>doubt in this, viz., that the understanding, by perseverance, perceives<br>all things. The characteristic of mind is meditation. The characteristic<br>of the good man is to live unperceived.[128] Devotion has acts for its<br>characteristic. Knowledge is the characteristic of renunciation.<br>Therefore keeping knowledge, before his view, the man of understanding<br>should practise renunciation. The man who has betaken himself to<br>renunciation and who is possessed of knowledge, who transcends all pairs<br>of opposites, as also darkness, death, and decrepitude, attains to the<br>highest goal. I have thus declared to you duty what the indications are<br>of duty. I shall, after this, tell you of the seizure (comprehension) of<br>qualities. Smell, which appertains to earth, is seized by the nose. The<br>wind, that dwells in the nose is likewise appointed (as an agent) in the<br>perception of smell. Taste is the essence of water. That is seized by the<br>tongue. Soma, who resides in the tongue, is appointed likewise in the<br>perception of taste. The quality of a lighted body is colour. That is<br>seized by the eye. Aditya who always resides in the eye has been<br>appointed in the perception of colour. Touch always appertains to the<br>wind (as its quality). That is perceived by the skin. The wind that<br>always resides in the skin has been appointed in apprehending touch. The<br>quality of ether is sound. That is seized by the ear. All the quarters,<br>which reside in the ear, have been appointed in apprehending sound. The<br>quality of the mind is thought. That is seized by the understanding. The<br>upholder of consciousness, residing in the heart, has been appointed in<br>apprehending the mind. The understanding is apprehended in the form of<br>determination or certitude, and Mahat in the form of knowledge. The<br>unperceived (Prakriti) has been, it is evident, appointed for the seizure<br>of all things after certitude. There is no doubt in this.[129] The<br>Kshetrajna which is eternal and is destitute of qualities as regards its<br>essence, is incapable of being seized by symbols. Hence, the<br>characteristic of the Kshetrajna, which is without symbols, is purely<br>knowledge. The unmanifest resides in the symbol called Kshetra, and is<br>that in which the qualities are produced and absorbed. I always see,<br>know, and hear it (though) it is hidden. Purusha knows it: therefore is<br>he called Kshetrajna. The Kshetrajna perceives also the operations of the<br>qualities and absence of their operations. The qualities, which are<br>created repeatedly, do not know themselves, being unintelligent, as<br>entities to be created and endued with a beginning, middle, and end. No<br>one else attains, only the Kshetrajna attains, to that which is the<br>highest and great and which transcend the qualities and those entities<br>which are born of the qualities. Hence one who understands duties,<br>casting off qualities and the understanding, and having his sins<br>destroyed, and transcending the qualities, enters the Kshetrajna. One<br>that is free from all pairs of opposites, that never bends his head to<br>any one, that is divested of Swaha, that is immovable, and homeless, is<br>the Kshetrajna. He is the Supreme Lord."'
