                            "&#8212;The Brahmana said, 'The acts, good and bad, that a Jiva does are not<br>subject to destruction. Upon attainment of body after body, those acts<br>produce fruits corresponding with them.[16] As a fruit-bearing tree, when<br>the season comes of productivity, yields a large quantity of fruit,<br>similarly merit, achieved with a pure heart, yields a large crop (of<br>felicity). After the same fashion, sin, done with a sinful heart,<br>produces a large crop of misery. The Soul (or Jiva), placing the mind<br>ahead, addresses himself to action. Hear then how Jiva, equipt with all<br>his acts and overwhelmed with lust and wrath, enters the womb. The vital<br>seed, mixed with blood, enters the womb of females and becomes the field<br>(of Jiva), good or bad, born of (his) acts. In consequence of his<br>subtlety and the condition of being unmanifest, Jiva does not become<br>attached to anything even after attaining to a body. Therefore, he is<br>called Eternal Brahman.[17] That (viz., Jiva or Brahman) is the seed of<br>all creatures. It is in consequence of Him that living creatures live.<br>That Jiva, entering all the limbs of the foetus part by part, accepting<br>the attribute of mind, and residing within all the regions that belong to<br>Prana, supports (life). In consequence of this, the foetus becoming<br>endued with mind begins to move its limbs.[18] As liquified iron, poured<br>(into a mould), takes the form of the mould, know that the entrance of<br>Jiva into the foetus is even such. As fire, entering a mass of iron,<br>heats it greatly, do thou know that the manifestation of Jiva in the<br>foetus is such. As a lamp, burning in a room, discovers (all things<br>within it), after the same manner mind discovers the different limbs of<br>the body.[19] Whatever acts, good or bad, Jiva does in a former body,<br>have certainly to be enjoyed or endured by him. By such enjoyment and<br>endurance former acts are exhausted, and other acts, again, accumulate,<br>till Jiva succeed in acquiring a knowledge of the duties included in that<br>contemplation which leads to Emancipation. Regarding this, I shall tell<br>thee those acts by which Jiva, O best of men, while coursing through a<br>repeated round of re-births, becomes happy, Gifts, observances of<br>austerity, Brahmacharyya, bearing Brahman according to the ordinances<br>laid down, self-restraint, tranquillity, compassion for all creatures,<br>restraint of passions, abstentions from cruelty as also from<br>appropriating what belongs to others, refraining from doing even mentally<br>all acts that are false and injurious to living creatures on the Earth,<br>reverently serving mother and father, honouring deities and guests,<br>worship of preceptors, pity, purity, constant restraint of all organs,<br>and causing of all good acts, are said to constitute the conduct of the<br>good. From observance of such conduct, arises Righteousness which<br>protects all creatures eternally. Such conduct one would always behold<br>among persons that are good. Verily, such conduct resides there<br>eternally. That course of practices to which persons of tranquil souls<br>adhere indicates Righteousness. Among them is thrown that course of<br>practices which constitutes eternal Righteousness. He who would betake<br>himself to that Righteousness would never have to attain to a miserable<br>end. It is by the conduct of the good that the world is restrained in the<br>paths of Righteousness when it falls away. He that is a Yogin is<br>Emancipated, and is, therefore, distinguished above these (viz., the<br>good).[20] Deliverance from the world takes place, after a long time, of<br>one who acts righteously and well on every occasion as he should. A<br>living creature thus always meets with the acts done by him in a former<br>life. All these acts constitute the cause in consequence of which he<br>comes into this world in a state different from his true form.[21] There<br>is a doubt in the world as regards the question. By what was the<br>acceptance (by Jiva) of a body first determined. The Grandsire of all the<br>worlds, viz., Brahma having first formed a body of his own, then created<br>the three worlds, in their entirety, of mobile and immobile creatures.<br>Having first himself assumed a body, he then created Pradhana. That<br>Pradhana is the material cause of all embodied creatures, by whom is all<br>this covered and whom all came to know as the highest. This that is seen<br>is said to be destructible; while the other is immortal and<br>indestructible. This that (is seen) is said to be Kshara (the<br>destructible); that, however, which is Para (the other) is the Immortal,<br>(as also) Akshara (the Indestructible). Of each Purusha taken<br>distributively, the whole is duality among these three.[22] Seen first<br>(to appear in an embodied form) Prajapati (then) created all the primal<br>elements and all immobile creatures. Even this is the ancient audition.<br>Of that (acceptance of body), the Grandsire ordained a limit in respect<br>of time, and migrations among diverse creatures and return or rebirth.<br>All that I say is proper and correct, like to what a person who is endued<br>with intelligence and who has seen his soul, would say on this topic of<br>previous births.[23] That person who looks upon pleasure and pain as<br>inconstant, which, indeed, is the correct view, who regards the body as<br>an unholy conglomeration, and destruction as ordained in action, and who<br>remembers that what little of pleasure there is, is really all pain, will<br>succeed in crossing this terrible ocean of worldly migration that is so<br>difficult to cross. Though assailed by decrepitude and death and disease,<br>he that understands Pradhana beholds with all equal eye that<br>Consciousness which dwells in all beings endued with consciousness.<br>Seeking the supreme seat, he then becomes utterly indifferent to all<br>(other) things. O best of men, I shall now impart instruction to thee,<br>agreeably to truth, concerning this. Do thou, O learned Brahmana,<br>understand in completeness that which constitutes the excellent<br>knowledge, as I declare it, of that indestructible seat.&#8212;'"
