                            "The Brahmana said, 'There is one Ruler. There is no second beside him.<br>He that is Ruler resides in the heart. I shall speak now of him. Impelled<br>by Him, I move as directed, like water along an inclined plane. There is<br>one Preceptor. There is no second beside him. He resides in the heart,<br>and of him I shall now speak. Be instructed by that preceptor; they who<br>are always endued with feelings of animosity are like snakes. There is<br>one kinsman. There is no second beside him. He resides in the heart of<br>him I shall now speak. Instructed by him, kinsmen become possessed of<br>kinsmen, and the seven Rishis, O son of Pritha, shine in the firmament.<br>There is one dispeller. There is no second beside him. He resides in the<br>heart. Of him I shall now speak. Having lived with that instructor under<br>the proper mode of living, Sakra attained to the sovereignty of all the<br>worlds.[73] There is one enemy. There is no second beside him. He resides<br>in the heart. Of him I shall now speak. Instructed by that preceptor all<br>snakes in the world are always endued with feelings of animosity. In this<br>connection is cited the ancient story of the instruction of the snakes,<br>the deities, and the Rishis by the Lord of all creatures. The deities and<br>the Rishis, the snakes, and the Asuras, seated around the Lord of all<br>creatures, asked him, saying,&#8212;Let that which is highly beneficial for us<br>be declared. Unto them that enquired about what is highly beneficial, the<br>holy one uttered only the word Om, which is Brahman in one syllable.<br>Hearing this, they ran away in various directions. Amongst them that thus<br>ran in all directions from desire of self-instruction, the disposition<br>first arose in snakes of biting. Of the Asuras, the disposition, born of<br>their nature for ostentations, pride arose. The deities betook themselves<br>to gifts, and the great Rishis to self-restraint. Having repaired to one<br>teacher, and having been instructed (refined) by one word, the snakes,<br>the deities, the Rishis, and the Danavas, all betook themselves to<br>diverse different dispositions. It is that one who hears himself when<br>speaking, and apprehends it duly. Once, again, is that heard from him<br>when he speaks. There is no second preceptor.[74] It is in obedience to<br>his counsels that action afterwards flows. The instructor, the<br>apprehender, the hearer, and the enemy, are pleased within the heart. By<br>acting sinfully in the world it is he that becomes a person of sinful<br>deeds. By acting auspiciously in the world, it is he who becomes a person<br>of auspicious deeds. It is he who becomes a person of unrestrained<br>conduct by becoming addicted to the pleasures of sense, impelled by<br>desire. It is he who becomes a Brahmacharin by always devoting himself to<br>the subjugation of his senses. It is he, again, that casts off vows and<br>actions and takes refuge on Brahman alone. By moving in the world,<br>identifying himself the while with Brahman, he becomes a Brahmacharin.<br>Brahman. is his fuel; Brahman is his fire; Brahman is his origin; Brahman<br>is his water; Brahman is his preceptor: he is rapt in Brahman.<br>Brahmacharyya is even so subtle, as understood by the wise. Having<br>understood it, they betook themselves to it, instructed by the<br>Kshetrajna!'"[75]
