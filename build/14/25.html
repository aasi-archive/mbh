                            "The Brahmana said, 'In this connection is recited the ancient story of<br>what the institution is of the Chaturhotra (sacrifice). The ordinances<br>are now being duly declared of that in its entirety. Listen to me, O<br>amiable lady, as I declare this wonderful mystery. The agent, the<br>instrument, the action and Emancipation,&#8212;these, O beautiful lady, are<br>the four sacrificing priests by whom the universe is enveloped. Hear in<br>its entirety the assignment of causes (relating to this topic). The nose,<br>the tongue, the eye, the skin, the ear numbering the fifth, the mind, and<br>the understanding,&#8212;these seven should be understood as being caused by<br>(the knowledge of) qualities. Smell, taste, colour, sound, touch,<br>numbering the fifth, the objects of the mind, and the objects of the<br>understanding, these seven are caused by action. He who smells, he who<br>eats, he who sees, he who speaks, he who hears, numbering the fifth, he<br>who thinks, and he who understands&#8212;these seven should be known as caused<br>by the agent. Possessed of qualities, these enjoy their own qualities,<br>agreeable or disagreeable.[68] As regards the Soul, that is destitute of<br>qualities. These seven are the causes of Emancipation. With them that are<br>learned and possessed of sufficient understanding, the qualities, which<br>are in the position of deities, eat the oblations, each in its proper<br>place, and agreeably to what has been ordained. The person who is<br>destitute of learning, eating diverse kind of food, becomes seized with<br>the sense of mineness.[69] Digesting food for himself, he becomes ruined<br>through the sense of mineness. The eating of food that should not be<br>eaten, and the drinking of wine, ruin him. He destroys the food (he<br>takes), and having destroyed that food, he becomes destroyed himself. The<br>man of learning, however, being possessed of puissance, destroys his food<br>for reproducing it. The minutest transgression does not arise in him from<br>the food he takes. Whatever is thought of by the mind, whatever is<br>uttered by speech, whatever is heard by the ear, whatever is seen by the<br>eye, whatever is touched by the (sense of) touch, whatever is smelt by<br>the nose, constitute oblations of clarified butter which should all,<br>after restraining the senses with the mind numbering the sixth, be poured<br>into that fire of high merits which burns within the body, viz., the<br>Soul.[70] The sacrifice constituted by Yoga is going on as regards<br>myself. The spring whence that sacrifice proceeds is that which yields<br>the fire of knowledge. The upward life-wind Prana is the Stotra of that<br>sacrifice. The downward life-wind Apana is its Sastra. The renunciation<br>of everything is the excellent Dakshina of that sacrifice. Consciousness,<br>Mind, and Understanding&#8212;these becoming Brahma, are its Hotri, Adhwaryyu,<br>and Udgatri. The Prasastri, his Sastra, is truth.[71] Cessation of<br>separate existence (or Emancipation) is the Dakshina. In this connection,<br>people conversant with Narayana recite some Richs. Unto the divine<br>Narayana were animals offered in days of yore.[72] Then are sung some<br>Samanas. On that topic occurs an authority. O timid one, know that the<br>divine Narayana is the soul of all.'"
