                            "The Rishis said,&#8212;'Which among the duties is deemed to be the most<br>worthy of being performed? The diverse modes of duty, we see, are<br>contradictory. Some say that (it remains) after the body (is destroyed).<br>Others say that it does not exist. Some say that everything is doubtful.<br>Others have no doubts.[146] Some say that the eternal (principle) is not<br>eternal. Some say that it exists, and some that it exists not. Some say<br>it is of one form, or two-fold, and others that it is mixed. Some<br>Brahmanas who are conversant with Brahman and utterers of truth regard it<br>to be one. Others, that it is distinct; and others again that it is<br>manifold. Some say that both time and space exist; others, that it is not<br>so. Some bear matted locks on their heads and are clad in deer-skins.<br>Others have shaven crowns and go entirely naked. Some are for entire<br>abstention from bathing, and some for bathing. Such differences of views<br>may be seen among deities and Brahmanas conversant with Brahman and<br>endued with perceptions of truth. Some are for taking food; while some<br>are devoted to fasts. Some applaud action; others applaud perfect<br>tranquillity. Some applaud Emancipation; some, various kinds of<br>enjoyments. Some desire diverse kinds of wealth; some, poverty. Some say<br>that means should be resorted to; others, that this is not so. Some are<br>devoted to a life of abstention from harm; others are addicted to<br>destruction. Some are for merit and glory, others say that this is not<br>so. Some are devoted to goodness; others are established on doubt. Some<br>are for pleasure; some are for pain. Other people say that it is<br>meditation. Other learned Brahmanas say that it is Sacrifice. Others,<br>again, say that it is gift. Others applaud penances; others, the study of<br>the scriptures. Some say that knowledge and renunciation (should be<br>followed). Others who ponder on the elements say that it is Nature. Some<br>extol everything; others, nothing. O foremost one of the deities, duty<br>being thus confused and full of contradictions of various kinds, we are<br>deluded and unable to come to any conclusion. People stand up for acting,<br>saying,&#8212;This is good,&#8212;This is good&#8212;He that is attached to a certain<br>duty applauds that duty as the best. For this reason our understanding<br>breaks down and our mind is distracted. We therefore, wish, O best of all<br>beings, to know what is good. It behoves thee to declare to us, after<br>this, what is (so) mysterious, and what is the cause of the connection<br>between the Kshetrajna and Nature. Thus addressed by those learned<br>Brahmanas, the illustrious creator of the worlds, endued with great<br>intelligence and possessed of a righteous soul, declared to them<br>accurately what they asked.'"
