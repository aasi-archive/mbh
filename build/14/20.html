                            "Vasudeva said, 'In this connection is cited the ancient narrative, O son<br>of Pritha, of the discourse that took place between a married couple. A<br>certain Brahmana's spouse, beholding the Brahmana, her husband who was a<br>complete master of every kind of knowledge and wisdom, seated in<br>seclusion, said unto him,&#8212;Into what region shall I go, depending on thee<br>as my husband,&#8212;thee that art seated, having cast off all (religious)<br>acts, that art harsh in thy conduct towards me, and that art so<br>undiscerning?[46] It has been heard by us that a wife attains to those<br>regions which are acquired by her husband. What, indeed, is the goal that<br>I shall attain, having obtained thee for my husband?&#8212;Thus questioned,<br>that Brahmana of tranquil soul then said unto her, smilingly,&#8212;O blessed<br>dame, I am not offended with these words of thine, O sinless one.<br>Whatever acts exist that are adopted with the aid of others, that are<br>seen (in consequence of their grossness), and that are true, are done as<br>acts by men devoted to acts.[47] Those persons that are destitute of<br>knowledge, only store delusion by acts. Freedom from acts, again, is<br>incapable of being attained in this world for even a moment. From birth<br>to the attainment of a different form, action good or bad, and<br>accomplished by acts, mind, or speech, exists in all beings. Those paths<br>(of action) which are characterised by visible objects (such as<br>Soma-juice and ghee for libations) being destroyed by Rakshasas, turning<br>away from them I have perceived the seat (of the soul) that is in the<br>body, without the aid of the soul.[48] There dwells Brahma transcending<br>all pairs of opposites; there Soma with Agni: and there the urger of the<br>understanding (viz., Vayu) always moves, upholding all creatures.[49] It<br>is for that seat that the Grandsire Brahman and others, concentrated in<br>Yoga, worship the Indestructible. It is for that seat that men of<br>learning and excellent vows, of tranquil souls, and of senses completely<br>vanquished, strive.[50] That is not capable of being smelt by the sense<br>of smell; nor tasted by the tongue; or touched by the organs of touch. It<br>is by the mind that that is attained. It is incapable of being conquered<br>by the eye. It transcends the sense of hearing. It is destitute of scent,<br>taste, touch, and form as attributes. It is that from which proceeds the<br>well-ordained universe, and it is that upon which it rests. The<br>life-breaths called Prana and Apana and Samana and Vyana and Udana flow<br>from it, and it is that into which they again enter. The breaths Prana<br>and Apana move between Samana and Vyana. When the soul sleeps, both<br>Samana and Vyana are absorbed.[51] Between Apana and Prana, Udana dwells,<br>pervading all. Hence, Prana and Apana do not desert a sleeping person. In<br>consequence of its controlling all the life-winds, the controlling breath<br>is called Udana. Hence, utterers of Brahman undergo penances which have<br>myself for their goal.[52] In the midst of all those life-breaths that<br>swallow up one another and move within the body, blazes forth the fire<br>called Vaiswanara made up of seven flames. The nose, the tongue, the eye,<br>the skin, the ear which numbers the fifth, the mind, and the<br>understanding,&#8212;these are the seven tongues of that Vaiswanara's flame.<br>That which is smelt, that which is seen, that which is drunk, that which<br>is touched, as also that which is heard, that which is thought of, and<br>that which is understood,&#8212;these are the seven sorts of fuel for me. That<br>which smells, that which eats, that which sees, that which touches, that<br>which hears numbering the fifth; that which thinks, and that which<br>understands,&#8212;these are the seven great officiating priests. Behold, O<br>blessed one, learned sacrificers duly casting seven libations in seven<br>ways in the seven fires, viz., that which is smelt, that which is drunk,<br>that which is seen, that which is touched, as also that which is heard,<br>that which is thought of, and that which is understood, create them in<br>their own wombs.[53] Earth, Wind, Ether, Water, and Light numbering as<br>the fifth, Mind, and Understanding&#8212;these seven are called wombs (of all<br>things). All the attributes which constitute the sacrificial offerings,<br>enter into the attribute that is born of the fire, and having dwelt<br>within that dwelling became reborn in their respective wombs. Thither<br>also, viz., in that which generates all beings, they remain absorbed<br>during the period for which dissolution lasts. From that is produced<br>smell, from that is produced taste, from that is produced colour, and<br>from that is produced touch; from that is produced sound; from that<br>arises doubt; and from that is produced resolution. This is what is known<br>as the sevenfold creation. It is in this very way that all this was<br>comprehended by the ancients. By the three full and final libations, the<br>full become full with light.'"
