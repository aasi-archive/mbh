                            "Brahmana said, 'Since the mind is the ruler of these five elements, in<br>the matter of controlling and bringing them forth, the mind, therefore,<br>is the soul of the elements. The mind always presides over the great<br>elements. The understanding proclaims power, and is called the<br>Kshetrajna.[156] The mind yokes the senses as a charioteer yokes good<br>steeds. The senses, the mind, and the understanding are always joined to<br>the Kshetrajna. The individual soul, mounting the chariot to which big<br>steeds are yoked and which has the understanding for the reins, drives<br>about on all sides. With all the senses attached to it (for steeds), with<br>the mind for the charioteer, and the understanding for the eternal reins,<br>exists the great Brahman-car. Verily, that man endued with learning and<br>wisdom who always understands the Brahman-car in this way, is never<br>overwhelmed by delusion in the midst of all entities. This forest of<br>Brahman begins with the Unmanifest and ends with gross objects. It<br>includes mobile and immobile entities, and receives light from the<br>radiance of the sun and the moon, and is adorned with planets and<br>constellations. It is decked, again, on all sides with nets of rivers and<br>mountains. It is always embellished likewise by diverse kinds of waters.<br>It is the means of subsistence for all creatures. It is, again, the goal<br>of all living creatures. In that forest the Kshetrajna always moves<br>about. Whatever entities exist in this world, mobile and immobile, are<br>the very first to be dissolved away. After this (are dissolved) those<br>qualities which compose all entities. After the qualities (are dissolved)<br>the five elements. Such is the gradation of entities. Gods, men,<br>Gandharvas, Pisachas, Asuras, and Rakshasas, have all sprung from Nature,<br>and not from actions, not from a cause. The Brahmanas, who are creators<br>of the universe, are born here again and again. All that springs from<br>them dissolves, when the time comes, in those very five great elements<br>like billows in the ocean. All the great elements are beyond those<br>elements that compose the universe. He that is released from those five<br>elements goes to the highest goal. The puissant Prajapati created all<br>this by the mind only. After the same manner Rishis attained to the<br>status of deities by the aid of penance. After the same manner, those who<br>have achieved perfection, who were capable of the concentration of Yoga,<br>and who subsist on fruits and roots, likewise perceive the triple world<br>by penance. Medicines and herbs and all the diverse sciences are acquired<br>by means of penance alone, for all acquisition has penance for its root.<br>Whatever is difficult of acquisition, difficult to learn, difficult to<br>vanquish, difficult to pass through, are all achievable by penance, for<br>penance is irresistible. One that drinks alcoholic liquors, one that<br>slays a Brahmana, one that steals, one that destroys a foetus, one that<br>violates one's preceptor's bed, becomes cleansed of such sin by penance<br>well performed. Human beings, Pitris, deities, (sacrificial) animals,<br>beasts and birds, and all other creatures mobile and immobile, by always<br>devoting themselves to penances, become crowned with success by penance<br>alone. In like manner, the deities, endued with great powers of illusion,<br>have attained to Heaven. Those who without idleness perform acts with<br>expectations, being full of egoism, approach the presence of Prajapati.<br>Those high-souled ones, however, who are devoid of mineness and freed<br>from egoism through the pure contemplation of Yoga, attain to the great<br>and highest regions. Those who best understand the self, having attained<br>to Yoga contemplation and having their minds always cheerful, enter into<br>the unmanifest accumulation of happiness. Those persons who are freed<br>from the idea of mineness as also from egoism and who are reborn after<br>having attained to the fullness of Yoga contemplation, enter (when they<br>depart from such life) into the highest region reserved for the great,<br>viz., the Unmanifest. Born from that same unmanifest (principle) and<br>attaining to the same once more, freed from the qualities of Darkness and<br>Passion, and adhering to only the quality of Goodness, one becomes<br>released from every sin and creates all things.[157] Such a one should be<br>known to be Kshetrajna in perfection. He that knows him, knows the<br>Veda.[158] Attaining to pure knowledge from (restraining) the mind, the<br>ascetic should sit self-restrained. One necessarily becomes that on which<br>one's mind is set. This is an eternal mystery. That which has the<br>unmanifest for its beginning and gross qualities for its end, has been<br>said to have Ne-science for its indication. But do you understand that<br>whose nature is destitute of qualities? Of two syllables is Mrityu<br>(death); of three syllable is the eternal Brahman. Mineness is death, and<br>the reverse of mineness is the eternal.[159] Some men who are led by bad<br>understanding applaud action. Those, however, that are numbered among the<br>high-souled ancients never applaud action. By action is a creature born<br>with body which is made up of the sixteen.[160] (True) Knowledge swallows<br>up Purusha (Self with consciousness of body). Even this is what is highly<br>acceptable to eaters of Amrita.[161] Therefore, those whose vision<br>extends to the other end (of the ocean of life) have no attachment for<br>actions. This Purusha, however, is full of knowledge and not full of<br>action.[162] He dies not who understands Him that is immortal, immutable,<br>incomprehensible, eternal and indestructible&#8212;Him that is the restrained<br>Soul and that transcends all attachments. He who thus understands the<br>Soul to which there is nothing prior which is uncreated, immutable,<br>unconquered, and incomprehensible even to those that are eaters of<br>nectar, certainly becomes himself incomprehensible and immortal through<br>these means. Expelling all impressions and restraining the Soul in the<br>Soul, he understands that auspicious Brahman than which nothing greater<br>exists. Upon the understanding becoming clear, he succeeds in attaining<br>to tranquillity. The indication of tranquillity is like what takes place<br>in a dream.[163] This is the goal of these emancipated ones who are<br>intent on knowledge. They behold all those movements which are born of<br>successive developments.[164] This is the goal of those who are<br>unattached to the world, This is the eternal usage. This is the<br>acquisition of men of knowledge. This is the uncensured mode of conduct.<br>This goal is capable of being attained by one that is alike to all<br>creatures, that is without attachment, that is without expectations, and<br>that looks equally on all things. I have now declared everything to you,<br>ye foremost of regenerate Rishis. Do you act in this way forthwith; you<br>will then acquire success.'<br><br>"The preceptor continued, 'Thus addressed by the preceptor Brahma, those<br>high-souled sages acted accordingly and then attained to many regions (of<br>great felicity). Do thou also, O blessed one, duly act according to the<br>words of Brahma as declared by me, O thou of pure soul. Thou wilt then<br>attain to success.'<br><br>"Vasudeva said,&#8212;'Thus instructed in the principles of high religion by<br>the preceptor, the pupil, O son of Kunti, did everything accordingly, and<br>then attained to Emancipation. Having done all that he should have done,<br>the pupil, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, attained to that seat repairing<br>whither one has not to grieve.'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'Who, indeed, was that Brahmana, O Krishna, and who the<br>pupil, O Janarddana. Truly, if it is fit to be heard by me, do thou then<br>tell me, O lord!'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'I am the preceptor, O mighty-armed one, and know that<br>the mind is my pupil. Through my affection for thee, O Dhananjaya, I have<br>related this mystery to thee. If thou hast any love for me, O perpetuator<br>of Kuru's race, do thou then, after having heard these instructions<br>relating to the Soul, always act duly (according to them), O thou of<br>excellent vows. Then when this religion has been duly practised, O mower<br>of foes, thou wilt become freed from all thy sins and attain to absolute<br>emancipation. Formerly, when the hour of battle came, this very religion,<br>O thou of mighty arms, was declared by me (to thee)! Do thou, therefore,<br>set thy mind on it. And now, O chief of Bharata's race, it is long since<br>that I saw the lord my sire. I wish to see him again, with thy leave, O<br>Phalguna!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Unto Krishna who had said so, Dhananjaya said<br>in reply,&#8212;We shall go to-day from this town to the city called after the<br>elephant. Meeting king Yudhishthira of virtuous soul there, and informing<br>him (of thy intention) thou shalt then repair to thy own city!'"
