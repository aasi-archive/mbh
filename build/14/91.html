                            "Janamejaya said, 'O puissant Rishi, kings are attached to sacrifices.<br>The great Rishis are attached to penances. Learned Brahmanas are<br>observant of tranquillity of mind, peacefulness of behaviour, and<br>self-restraint. Hence it seems that nothing can be seen in this world<br>which can compare with the fruits of sacrifices. Even this is my<br>conviction. That conviction, again, seems to be undoubtedly correct.<br>Innumerable kings, O best of regenerate persons, having worshipped the<br>deities in sacrifices, earned high fame here and obtained Heaven<br>hereafter. Endued with great energy, the puissant chief of the deities<br>viz., Indra of a thousand eyes, obtained the sovereignty over the deities<br>through the many sacrifices he performed with gifts in profusion and<br>attained to the fruition of all his wishes. When king Yudhishthira, with<br>Bhima and Arjuna by him, resembled the chief of the deities himself in<br>prosperity and prowess, why then did that mongoose depreciate that great<br>Horse-sacrifice of the high-souled monarch?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Do thou listen to me, O king, as I discourse to thee<br>duly, O Bharata, on the excellent ordinances relating to sacrifice and<br>the fruits also, O ruler of men, that sacrifice yields. Formerly, on one<br>occasion Sakra performed a particular sacrifice. While the limbs of the<br>sacrifice were spread out, the Ritwijas became busy in accomplishing the<br>diverse rites ordained in the scriptures. The pourer of libations,<br>possessed of every qualification, became engaged in pouring libations of<br>clarified butter. The great Rishis were seated around. The deities were<br>summoned one by one by contented Brahmanas of great learning uttering<br>scriptural Mantras in sweet voices. Those foremost of Adhwaryyus, not<br>fatigued with what they did, recited the Mantras of the Yajurveda in soft<br>accents. The time came for slaughtering the animals. When the animals<br>selected for sacrifice were seized, the great Rishis, O king, felt<br>compassion for them. Beholding that the animals had all become cheerless,<br>those Rishis, endued with wealth of penances, approached Sakra and said<br>unto him, 'This method of sacrifice is not auspicious. Desirous of<br>acquiring great merit as thou art, this is verily an indication of thy<br>unacquaintance with sacrifice. O Purandara, animals have not been<br>ordained to be slaughtered in sacrifices. O puissant one, these<br>preparations of thine are destructive of merit. This sacrifice is not<br>consistent with righteousness. The destruction of creatures can never be<br>said to be an act of righteousness. If thou wishest it, let thy priests<br>perform thy sacrifice according to the Agama. By performing a sacrifice<br>according to the (true import of the) scriptural ordinances, great will<br>be the merit achieved by thee. O thou of a hundred eyes, do thou perform<br>the sacrifice with seeds of grain that have been kept for three years.<br>Even this, O Sakra, would be fraught with great righteousness and<br>productive of fruits of high efficacy.' The deity of a hundred<br>sacrifices, however, influenced by pride and overwhelmed by stupefaction,<br>did not accept these words uttered by the Rishis. Then, O Bharata, a<br>great dispute arose in that sacrifice of Sakra between the ascetics as to<br>how sacrifices should be performed, that is, should they be performed<br>with mobile creatures or with immobile objects. All of them were worn out<br>with disputation. The Rishis then, those beholders of truth, having made<br>an understanding with Sakra (about referring the matter to arbitration)<br>asked king Vasu, 'O highly blessed one, what is the Vedic declaration<br>about sacrifices? Is it preferable to perform sacrifices with animals or<br>with steeds and juices? Hearing the question, king Vasu, without all<br>judging of the strength or weakness of the arguments on the two sides, at<br>once answered, saying, 'Sacrifices may be performed with whichever of the<br>two kinds of objects is ready.' Having answered the question thus, he had<br>to enter the nether regions. Indeed the puissant ruler of the Chedis had<br>to undergo that misery for having answered falsely. Therefore, when a<br>doubt arises, no person, however wise, should singly decide the matter,<br>unless he be the puissant and self-born Lord himself of creatures. Gifts<br>made by a sinner with an impure understanding, even when they are very<br>large, become lost. Such gifts go for nothing. By the gifts made by a<br>person of unrighteous conduct,&#8212;one, that is, who is of sinful soul and<br>who is a destroyer, just fame is never acquired either here or hereafter.<br>That person of little intelligence who, from desire of acquiring merit,<br>performs sacrifices with wealth acquired by unrighteous means, never<br>succeeds in earning merit. That low wretch of sinful soul, who<br>hypocritically assuming a garb of righteousness mikes gifts unto<br>Brahmanas, only creates the conviction in men about his own righteousness<br>(without earning true merit). That Brahmana of uncontrolled conduct, who<br>acquires wealth by sinful acts, over overwhelmed by passion and<br>stupefaction, attains at last to the goal of the sinful. Someone,<br>overwhelmed by cupidity and stupefaction, becomes bent on strong wealth.<br>He is seen to persecute all creatures, urged by a sinful and impure<br>understanding. He who, having acquired wealth by such means, makes gifts<br>or performs sacrifices therewith, never enjoys the fruits of those gifts<br>or sacrifices in the other world in consequence of the wealth having been<br>earned by unrighteous means. Men endued with wealth of penances, by<br>giving away, to the best of their power, grains of corn picked up from<br>the fields or roots or fruits or pot-herbs or water or leaves, acquire<br>great merit and proceed to Heaven. Even such gifts, as also compassion to<br>all creatures, and Brahmacharyya, truthfulness of speech and kindness,<br>and fortitude, and forgiveness, constitute the eternal foundations of<br>Righteousness which itself is eternal. We hear of Visvamitra and other<br>kings of ancient times. Indeed, Visvamitra, and Asita, and king Janaka,<br>and Kakshasena and Arshtisena, and king Sindhudwipa,&#8212;these and many<br>other kings, endued with wealth of penances, having made gifts of<br>articles acquired lawfully, have attained to high success. Those amongst<br>Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras who betake themselves to<br>penances, O Bharata, and who purify themselves by gifts and other acts of<br>righteousness, proceed to Heaven."
