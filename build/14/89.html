                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having cooked, according to due rites, the other<br>excellent animals that were sacrificed, the priests then sacrificed,<br>agreeably to the injunctions of the scriptures, that steed (which had<br>wandered over the whole world). After cutting that horse into pieces,<br>conformably to scriptural directions, they caused Draupadi of great<br>intelligence, who was possessed of the three requisites of mantras,<br>things, and devotion, to sit near the divided animal. The Brahmanas then<br>with cool minds, taking up the marrow of that steed, cooked it duly, O<br>chief of Bharata's race. King Yudhishthira the just, with all his younger<br>brothers, then smelled, agreeably to the scriptures, the smoke, capable<br>of cleansing one from every sin, of the marrow that was thus cooked. The<br>remaining limbs, O king, of that horse, were poured into the fire by the<br>sixteen sacrificial priests possessed of great wisdom. Having thus<br>completed the sacrifice of that monarch, who was endued with the energy<br>of Sakra himself, the illustrious Vyasa with his disciples eulogised the<br>king greatly. Then Yudhishthira gave away unto the Brahmanas a thousand<br>crores of golden nishkas, and unto Vyasa he gave away the whole Earth.<br>Satyavati's son Vyasa, having accepted the Earth, addressed that foremost<br>one of Bharata's race, viz., king Yudhishthira the just, and said, 'O<br>best of kings, the Earth which thou hast given me I return unto thee. Do<br>thou give me the purchasing value, for Brahmanas are desirous of wealth<br>(and have no use with the Earth).' The high-souled Yudhishthira of great<br>intelligence staying with his brothers in the midst of the kings invited<br>to his sacrifice, said unto those Brahmanas, The 'Dakshina ordained in<br>the scriptures for the great Horse-sacrifice is the Earth. Hence, I have<br>given away unto the sacrificial priests the Earth conquered by Arjuna. Ye<br>foremost of Brahmanas, I shall enter the woods. Do ye divide the Earth<br>among yourselves. Indeed, do you divide the Earth into four parts<br>according to what is done in the Chaturhotra sacrifice. Ye best of<br>regenerate ones I do not desire to appropriate what now belongs to the<br>Brahmanas. Even this, ye learned Brahmanas, has been the intention always<br>cherished by myself and my brothers.' When the king said these words, his<br>brothers and Draupadi also said, 'Yes, it is even so.' Great was the<br>sensation created by this announcement. Then, O Bharata, an invisible<br>voice was heard in the welkin, saying,&#8212;'Excellent, Excellent!' The<br>murmurs also of crowds of Brahmanas as they spoke arose. The Island-born<br>Krishna, highly applauding him, once more addressed Yudhishthira, in the<br>presence of the Brahmanas, saying, 'The Earth has been given by thee to<br>me. I, however, give her back to thee. Do thou give unto these Brahmanas<br>gold. Let the Earth be thine.' Then Vasudeva, addressing king<br>Yudhishthira the just, said, 'It behoveth thee to do as thou art bid by<br>the illustrious Vyasa.' Thus addressed, the foremost one of Kuru's race,<br>along with all his brothers, became glad of soul, and gave away millions<br>of golden coins, in fact, trebling the Dakshina ordained for the<br>Horse-sacrifice. No other king will be able to accomplish what the Kuru<br>king accomplished on that occasion after the manner of Marutta. Accepting<br>that wealth, the Island-born sage, Krishna, of great learning, gave it<br>unto the sacrificial priests, dividing it into four parts. Having paid<br>that wealth as the price of the Earth, Yudhishthira, cleansed of his sins<br>and assured of Heaven rejoiced with his brothers. The sacrificial<br>priests, having got that unlimited quantity of wealth, distributed it<br>among the Brahmanas gladly and according to the desire of each recipient.<br>The Brahmanas also divided amongst themselves, agreeably to<br>Yudhishthira's permission, the diverse ornaments of gold that were in the<br>sacrificial compound, including the triumphal arches, the stakes, the<br>jars, and diverse kinds of vessels. After the Brahmanas had taken as much<br>as they desired, the wealth that remained was taken away by Kshatriyas<br>and Vaisyas and Sudras and diverse tribes of Mlechechas. Thus gratified<br>with presents by king Yudhishthira of great intelligence, the Brahmanas,<br>filled with joy, returned to their respective abodes. The holy and<br>illustrious Vyasa respectfully presented his own share, which was very<br>large, of that gold unto Kunti. Receiving that gift of affection from her<br>father-in-law, Pritha became glad of heart and devoted it to the<br>accomplishment of diverge acts of merit. King Yudhishthira, having bathed<br>at the conclusion of his sacrifice and become cleansed of all his sins,<br>shone in the midst of his brothers, honoured by all, like the chief of<br>the celestials in the midst of the denizens of Heaven. The sons of Pandu,<br>surrounded by the assembled kings, looked as beautiful, O king, as the<br>planets in the midst of the stars. Unto those kings they made presents of<br>various jewels and gems, and elephants and horses and ornaments of gold,<br>and female slaves and cloths and large measures of gold. Indeed, Pritha's<br>son by distributing that untold wealth among the invited monarchs, shone,<br>O king, like Vaisravana, the lord of treasures. Summoning next the heroic<br>king Vabhruvahana, Yudhishthira gave unto him diverse kinds of wealth in<br>profusion and gave him permission to return home. The son of Pandu, for<br>gratifying his sister Dussala, established her infant grandson in his<br>paternal kingdom. The Kuru king Yudhishthira, having a full control over<br>his senses, then dismissed the assembled kings all of whom had been<br>properly classed and honoured by him.[212] The illustrious son of Pandu,<br>that chastiser of foes, then duly worshipped the high-souled Govinda and<br>Valadeva of great might, and the thousands of other Vrishni heroes having<br>Pradyumna for their first. Assisted by his brothers, he then dismissed<br>them for returning to Dwaraka. Even thus was celebrated that sacrifice of<br>king Yudhishthira the just, which was distinguished by a profuse<br>abundance of food and wealth and jewels and gems, and oceans of wines of<br>different kinds. There were lakes whose mire consisted of ghee, and<br>mountains of food. There were also, O chief of Bharata's race, miry<br>rivers made of drinks having the six kinds of taste. Of men employed in<br>making and eating the sweetmeats called Khandavaragas, and of animals<br>slain for food, there was no end.[213] The vast space abounded with men<br>inebriated with wine, and with young ladies filled with joy. The<br>extensive grounds constantly echoed with the sounds of drums and the<br>blare of conches. With all these, the sacrifice became exceedingly<br>delightful. 'Let agreeable things be given away,'&#8212;'Let agreeable food be<br>eaten,'&#8212;these were the sounds that were repeatedly heard day and night<br>in that sacrifice. It was like a great festival, full of rejoicing and<br>contented men. People of diverse realms speak of that sacrifice to this<br>day. Having showered wealth in torrents, and diverse objects of desire,<br>and jewels and gems, and drinks of various kinds, the foremost one of<br>Bharata's race, cleansed of all his sins, and his purpose fulfilled,<br>entered his capital.
