                            "'The Brahmanas said, 'Let offerings be made unto the high-souled<br>Mahadeva of three eyes. Having duly dedicated those offerings, O king, we<br>shall then strive to gain our object.' Hearing these words of those<br>Brahmanas, Yudhishthira caused offerings to be duly made unto that deity<br>who loved to lie down on mountain-breasts. Gratifying the (sacrificial)<br>fire with (libations of) sanctified butter according to the ordinance,<br>the priest (Dhaumya) cooked Charu with the aid of Mantras and performed<br>the necessary rites. He took up many flowers and sanctified them with<br>Mantras, O king. With Modakas and frumenty and meat, he made offerings to<br>the deity. With diverse kinds of flowers and with fried paddy, of very<br>superior kind, Dhaumya, well-versed in the Vedas, performed the remaining<br>rites. He next presented offerings according to the ordinance unto those<br>ghostly beings who formed Mahadeva's train. And offerings were next made<br>to Kuvera, the chief of the Yakshas, and unto Manibhadra also. Unto the<br>other Yakshas also and unto them that were the foremost ones among the<br>ghostly companions of Mahadeva, the priest offered due worship, having<br>filled many jugs with food, with Krisaras and meat and Nivapas mixed with<br>sesame seeds. The king gave away unto the Brahmanas thousands of kine. He<br>then directed the presentation, according to due rites, of offerings unto<br>those night-wandering beings (who live with Mahadeva). Surcharged, as it<br>were, with the scent of Dhupas, and filled with the fragrance of flowers,<br>that region, sacred to the deity of deities, O king, became exceedingly<br>delightful. Having performed the worship of Rudra and of all the Ganas,<br>the king, placing Vyasa ahead, proceeded towards the place where the<br>treasure was buried. Once more worshipping the Lord of treasures, and<br>bowing unto him with reverence and saluting him properly, with diverse<br>kinds of flowers and cakes and Krisara, having worshipped those foremost<br>of gems, viz., Sankha and Nidhi, and those Yakshas who are the lords of<br>gems, and having worshipped many foremost of Brahmanas and caused them to<br>utter blessings, the king endued with great puissance, strengthened by<br>the energy and the auspicious benedictions of those Brahmanas, caused<br>that spot to be excavated. Then numerous vessels of diverse and<br>delightful forms, and Bhringaras and Katahas and Kalasas and<br>Bardhamanakas, and innumerable Bhajanas of beautiful forms, were dug out<br>by king Yudhishthira the just. The wealth thus dug out was placed in<br>large 'Karaputas' for protection.[182] A portion of the wealth was caused<br>to be borne upon the shoulders of men in stout balances of wood with<br>baskets slung like scales at both ends. Indeed, O king, there were other<br>methods of conveyance there for bearing away that wealth of the son of<br>Pandu.[183] There were sixty thousands of camels and a hundred and twenty<br>thousand horses, and of elephants, O monarch, there were one hundred<br>thousand. Of cars there were as many, and of carts, too as many, and of<br>she-elephants as many. Of mules and men the number was untold. That<br>wealth which Yudhishthira caused to be dugout was even so much. Sixteen<br>thousand coins were placed on the back of each camel; eight thousand on<br>each car; four and twenty thousand on each elephant; (while proportionate<br>loads were placed on horses and mules and on the backs, shoulder and<br>heads of men). Having loaded these vehicles with that wealth and once<br>more worshipping the great deity Siva, the son of Pandu set out for the<br>city called after the elephant, with the permission of the Island-born<br>Rishi, and placing his priest Dhaumya in the van. That foremost of men,<br>viz., the royal son of Pandu, made short marches everyday, measured by a<br>Goyuta (4 miles). That mighty host, O king, afflicted with the weight<br>they bore, returned, bearing that wealth, towards the capital, gladdening<br>the hearts of all those perpetuators of the Kuru race.'"
