                            "The Brahmana said, 'In this connection is cited the following ancient<br>story. Do thou understand, of what kind the institution is of the ten<br>Hotris (sacrificing priests). The ear, the skin, the two eyes, the<br>tongue, the nose, the two feet, the two hands, the genital organ, the<br>lower duct, and speech,&#8212;these, O beautiful one, are the ten sacrificing<br>priests. Sound and touch, colour and taste, scent, speech, action,<br>motion, and the discharge of vital seed, of urine and of excreta, are the<br>ten libations. The points of the compass, Quarters, Wind, Sun, Moon,<br>Earth, Fire, Vishnu, Indra, Prajapati, and Mitra,&#8212;these, O beautiful<br>one, are the ten (sacrificial) fires. The ten organs (of knowledge and<br>action) are the sacrificing priests. The libations, O beautiful one, are<br>ten. The objects of the senses are the fuel that are cast into these ten<br>fires,[54] as also the mind, which is the ladle, and the wealth (viz.,<br>the good and bad acts of the sacrificer). What remains is the pure,<br>highest knowledge. We have heard that all this universe was well<br>differentiated (from Knowledge). All objects of knowledge are Mind.<br>Knowledge only perceives (i.e., discovers the Mind without being attached<br>to it). The knower (or Jiva), encased in subtle form, lives within the<br>gross body that is produced by the vital seed. The bearer of the body is<br>the Garhapatya fire. From that is produced another. Mind is the Ahavaniya<br>fire. Into it is poured the oblation. From that was produced the Veda (or<br>Word); (then was born Mind); Mind (desirous of creation) sets itself on<br>the Veda (or the Word). Their arises form (or colour) undistinguished by<br>particular colours. It runs towards the Mind.'"[55]<br><br>"The Brahmana's wife said, 'Why did Word first arise and why did Mind<br>arise afterwards, seeing that Word starts into existence after having<br>been thought upon by Mind? Upon that authority can it be said that Mati<br>(Prana) takes refuge in Mind. Why, again, in dreamless slumber, though<br>separated from Mind, does not Prana apprehend (all objects)? What is that<br>which restrains it then?'"[56]<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'The Apana breath, becoming the lord (i.e., bringing<br>the Prana under its control), in consequence of such lordship over it,<br>makes it identical with itself. That restrained motion of the Prana<br>breath (which for the time becomes identical with that of the Apana) has<br>been said to be the motion of the mind. Hence the mind is dependent upon<br>Prana, not Prana upon the mind. Therefore, in dreamless slumber, upon the<br>disappearance of mind, Prana does not disappear. But since thou askest me<br>a question about word and mind, I shall, therefore, relate to thee a<br>discourse between them. Both Word and Mind, repairing to the Soul of<br>matter,[57] asked him,&#8212;Do thou say who amongst us is superior. Do thou,<br>O puissant one, dispel our doubt.&#8212;On that occasion, the holy one made<br>this answer.&#8212;The mind undoubtedly (is superior). Unto him Word said,&#8212;'I<br>yield to thee the fruition of all thy desires!'[58]<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'Know that I have two minds, immovable and movable.<br>That which is immovable is, verily, with me; the movable is in your<br>dominion.[59] That mind is verily called movable which, in the form of<br>Mantra, letter, or voice, is referable to your dominion. Hence, thou art<br>superior (to the other mind which concerns itself with only the external<br>world). But since, coming of thy own accord, O beautiful one, thou<br>enterest into the engagement (about the fruition of all wishes),<br>therefore, filling myself with breath, I utter thee.[60] The goddess Word<br>used always to dwell between Prana and Apana. But, O blessed one, sinking<br>into Apana, though urged upwards, in consequence of becoming dissociated<br>from Prana, she ran to Prajapati and said,&#8212;Be gratified with me, O holy<br>one.&#8212;The Prana appeared, once more fostering Word. Hence, Word,<br>encountering deep exhalation, never utters anything. Word always flows as<br>endued with utterance or unendued with it.[61] Amongst those two, Word<br>without utterance is superior to Word with utterance. Like a cow endued<br>with excellent milk, she (Word without utterance) yields diverse kinds of<br>meaning. This one always yields the Eternal (viz., Emancipation),<br>speaking of Brahman. O thou of beautiful smiles, Word is a cow, in<br>consequence of her puissance which is both divine and not divine. Behold<br>the distinction of these two subtle forms of Word that flow.'"[62]<br><br>"The Brahmana's wife said, 'What did the goddess of Word then say, in<br>days of old, when, though impelled by the Wish to speak, Speech could not<br>come out?'"<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'The Word that is generated in the body by Prana,<br>then attains to Apana from Prana. Then transformed into Udana and issuing<br>out of the body, envelops all the quarters, with Vyana. After that, she<br>dwells in Samana. Even in this way did Word formerly speak. Hence Mind,<br>in consequence of being immovable, is distinguished, and the goddess<br>Word, in consequence of being movable, is also distinguished."'
