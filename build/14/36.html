                            "Brahma said, 'That which is unmanifest, which is indistinct,<br>all-pervading, everlasting, immutable, should be known to become the city<br>(or mansion) of nine portals, possessed of three qualities, and<br>consisting of five ingredients. Encompassed by eleven including Mind<br>which distinguishes (objects), and having Understanding for the ruler,<br>this is an aggregate of eleven.[104] The three ducts that are in it<br>support it constantly. These are the three Nadis. They run continually,<br>and have the three qualities for their essence: Darkness, Passion, and<br>Goodness. These are called the (three) qualities. These are coupled with<br>one another. They exist, depending on one another. They take refuge in<br>one another, and follow one another. They are also joined with one<br>another. The five (principal) elements are characterised by (these) three<br>qualities. Goodness is the match of Darkness. Of Goodness the match is<br>Passion. Goodness is also the match of Passion, and of Goodness the match<br>is Darkness. There where Darkness is restrained, Passion is seen to flow.<br>There where Passion is restrained, Goodness is seen to flow. Darkness<br>should be known to have the night (or obscurity) for its essence. It has<br>three characteristics, and is (otherwise) called Delusion. It has<br>unrighteousness (or sin) also for its indication, and it is always<br>present in all sinful acts. This is the nature of Darkness and it appears<br>also as confined with others. Passion is said to have activity for its<br>essence. It is the cause of successive acts. When it prevails, its<br>indication, among all beings, is production. Splendour, lightness, and<br>faith,&#8212;these are the form, that is light, of Goodness among all<br>creatures, as regarded by all good men. The true nature of their<br>characteristics will now be declared by me, with reasons. These shall be<br>stated in aggregation and separation. Do ye understand them. Complete<br>delusion, ignorance; illiberality, indecision in respect of action,<br>sleep, haughtiness, fear, cupidity, grief, censure of good acts, loss of<br>memory,&#8212;unripeness of judgment, absence of faith, violation of all rules<br>of conduct, want of discrimination, blindness, vileness of behaviour,<br>boastful assertions of performance when there has been no performance,<br>presumption of knowledge in ignorance, unfriendliness (or hostility),<br>evilness of disposition, absence of faith, stupid reasoning, crookedness,<br>incapacity for association, sinful action, senselessness, stolidity,<br>lassitude, absence of self-control, degradation,&#8212;all these qualities are<br>known as belonging to Darkness. Whatever other states of mind, connected<br>with delusion, exist in the world, all appertain to Darkness. Frequent<br>ill-speaking of other people, censuring the deities and the Brahmanas,<br>illiberality, vanity, delusion, wrath, unforgiveness, hostility towards<br>all creatures, are regarded as the characteristics of Darkness. Whatever<br>undertakings exist that are unmeritorious (in consequence of their being<br>vain or useless), what gifts there are that are unmeritorious (in<br>consequence of the unworthiness of the donees, the unreasonableness of<br>the time, the impropriety of the object, etc.), vain eating,&#8212;these also<br>appertain to Darkness. Indulgence in calumny, unforgiveness, animosity,<br>vanity, and absence of faith are also said to be characteristics of<br>Darkness. Whatever men there are in this world who are characterised by<br>these and other faults of a similar kind, and who break through the<br>restraints (provided by the scriptures), are all regarded as belonging to<br>the quality of Darkness. I shall now declare the wombs where these men,<br>who are always of sinful deeds, have to take their birth. Ordained to go<br>to hell, they sink in the order of being. Indeed, they sink into the hell<br>of (birth in) the brute creation. They become immobile entities, or<br>animals, or beasts of burden; or carnivorous creatures, or snakes, or<br>worms, insects, and birds; or creatures, of the oviparous order, or<br>quadrupeds of diverse species; or lunatics, or deaf or dumb human beings,<br>or men that are afflicted by dreadful maladies and regarded as unclean.<br>These men of evil conduct, always exhibiting the indications of their<br>acts, sink in Darkness. Their course (of migrations) is always downwards.<br>Appertaining to the quality of Darkness, they sink in Darkness. I shall,<br>after this, declare what the means are of their improvement and ascent;<br>indeed, by what means they succeed in attaining to the regions that exist<br>for men of pious deeds. Those men who take birth in orders other than<br>humanity, by growing up in view of the religious ceremonies of Brahmanas<br>devoted to the duties of their own order and desirous of doing good to<br>all creatures, succeed, through the aid of such purificatory rites, in<br>ascending upwards. Indeed, struggling (to improve themselves), they at<br>last attain to the same regions with these pious Brahmanas. Verily, they<br>go to Heaven. Even this is the Vedic audition.[105] Born in orders other<br>than humanity and growing old in their respective acts, even thus they<br>become human beings that are, of course, ordained to return. Coming to<br>sinful births and becoming Chandalas or human beings that are deaf or<br>that lisp indistinctly, they attain to higher and higher castes, one<br>after another in proper turn, transcending the Sudra order, and other<br>(consequences of) qualities that appertain to Darkness and that abide in<br>it in course of migrations in this world.[106] Attachment to objects of<br>desire is regarded as great delusion. Here Rishis and Munis and deities<br>become deluded, desirous of pleasure. Darkness, delusion, the great<br>delusion, the great obscurity called wrath, and death, that blinding<br>obscurity, (these are the five great afflictions). As regards wrath, that<br>is the great obscurity (and not aversion or hatred as is sometimes<br>included in the list). With respect then to its colour (nature), its<br>characteristics, and its source, I have, ye learned Brahmanas, declared<br>to you, accurately and in due order, everything about (the quality of)<br>Darkness. Who is there that truly understands it? Who is there that truly<br>sees it? That, indeed, is the characteristic of Darkness, viz., the<br>beholding of reality in what is not real. The qualities of Darkness have<br>been declared to you in various ways. Duly has Darkness, in its higher<br>and lower forms, been described to you. That man who always bears in mind<br>the qualities mentioned here, will surely succeed in becoming freed from<br>all characteristics that appertain to Darkness.'"
