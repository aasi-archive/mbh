                            "Vaisampayana said, 'As he of Vrishni's race was proceeding to Dwaraka,<br>those foremost princes of Bharata's race, those chastisers of foes<br>embraced him and fell back with their attendants. Phalguna repeatedly<br>embraced the Vrishni hero, and as long as he was within the range of<br>vision, he repeatedly turned his eyes towards him. With great difficulty,<br>the son of Pritha withdrew his gaze that had fallen on Govinda. The<br>unvanquished Krishna also (did the same). The indications that were<br>manifested on the occasion of that high-souled one's departure, I shall<br>now detail. Do thou listen to me. The wind blew with great speed before<br>the car, clearing the path of sand-grains and dust and thorns. Vasava<br>rained pure and fragrant showers and celestial flowers before the wielder<br>of Saranga. As the mighty-armed hero proceeded, he came upon the desert<br>ill supplied with water. There he beheld that foremost of ascetics, named<br>Utanka, of immeasurable energy. The hero of large eyes and great energy<br>worshipped that ascetic. He was then worshipped by the ascetic in return.<br>Vasudeva then enquired after his welfare. That foremost of Brahmanas,<br>viz., Utanka, politely accosted by Madhava, honoured him duly and then<br>addressed him in these words.&#8212;'O Saurin, having repaired to the mansions<br>of the Kurus and the Pandavas, hast thou succeeded in establishing a<br>durable understanding between them such as should exist between brothers?<br>It behoves thee to tell me everything. Dost thou come, O Kesava, after<br>having united them in peace,&#8212;them that are thy relatives and that are<br>ever dear to thee, O foremost one of Vrishni's race? Will the five sons<br>of Pandu, and the children of Dhritarashtra, O scorcher of foes, sport in<br>the world in joy with thee? Will all the kings enjoy happiness in their<br>respective kingdoms, in consequence of the pacification of the Kauravas<br>brought about by thee? Has that trust, O son, which I had always reposed<br>on thee, borne fruit with regard to the Kauravas?'<br><br>"The blessed and holy one said, 'I strove my best at first, for bringing<br>about a good understanding, in regard to the Kauravas. When I could not<br>by any means succeed in establishing them on peace, it happened that all<br>of them, with their relatives and kinsmen, met with death. It is<br>impossible to transgress destiny by either intelligence or might. O great<br>Rishi, O sinless one, this also cannot be unknown to thee. They (the<br>Kauravas) transgressed the counsels which Bhishma and Vidura gave them<br>referring to me.[168] Encountering one another they then became guests of<br>Yama's abode. Only the five Pandavas constitute the remnant of the<br>unslain, all their friends and all their children having been<br>slaughtered. All the sons of Dhritarashtra also with their children and<br>kinsmen, have been slain.' When Krishna had said these words, Utanka,<br>filled with wrath, and with eyes expanded in rage, addressed him in these<br>words.<br><br>"Utanka said,&#8212;'Since, though able, O Krishna, thou didst not rescue<br>those foremost ones of Kuru's race, who were thy relatives and,<br>therefore, dear to thee, I shall, without doubt, curse thee. Since thou<br>didst not forcibly compel them to forbear, therefore, O slayer of Madhu,<br>I shall, filled with wrath, denounce a curse on thee. It seems, O<br>Madhava, that though fully able (to save them), thou wert indifferent to<br>these foremost of Kurus who, overwhelmed by insincerity and hypocrisy<br>have all met with destruction.'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'O scion of Bhrigu's race, listen to what I say in<br>detail. Do thou accept my apologies also. O thou of Bhrigu's race, thou<br>art an ascetic. After having heard my words relating to the soul, thou<br>mayst then utter thy curse. No man is able, by a little ascetic merit, to<br>put me down. O foremost of ascetics, I do not wish to see the destruction<br>of all thy penances. Thou hast a large measure of blazing penances. Thou<br>hast gratified thy preceptors and seniors.[169] O foremost of regenerate<br>ones, I know that thou hast observed the rules of Brahmacharyya from the<br>days of thy infancy. I do not, therefore, desire the loss or diminution<br>of thy penances achieved with so much pain.'"
