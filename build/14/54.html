                            "Utanka said, 'Do thou, O Kesava, tell me that faultless Adhyatma. Having<br>heard thy discourse I shall ordain what is for thy good or denounce a<br>curse to thee, O Janarddana.'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'Know that the three qualities of Darkness and Passion<br>and Goodness exist, depending on me as their refuge. So also, O<br>regenerate one, know that the Rudras and the Vasus have sprung from me.<br>In me are all creatures, and in all creatures do I exist; know this. Let<br>no doubt arise in thy mind respecting this. So also, O regenerate one,<br>know that all the tribes of the Daityas, all the Yakshas, Gandharvas,<br>Rakshasas, Nagas. Apsaras, have sprung from me. Whatever has been called<br>existent and non-existent, whatever is manifest and not-manifest,<br>whatever is destructible and indestructible, all have me for their soul.<br>Those fourfold courses of duty which, O ascetic, are known to attach to<br>the (four) modes of life, and all the Vedic duties, have me for their<br>soul. Whatever is non-existent, whatever is existent and non-existent,<br>and whatever transcends that which is existent and non-existent,&#8212;all<br>these which constitute the universe&#8212;are from me. There is nothing higher<br>(or beyond) me who am the eternal god of gods.[170] O perpetuator of<br>Bhrigu's race, know that all the Vedas beginning with (the original<br>syllable) Om are identical with me. Know, O son of Bhrigu's race, that I<br>am the sacrificial stake; I am the Soma (drunk in sacrifices); I am the<br>Charu (cooked in sacrifices for being offered to the deities); I am the<br>Homa (that is performed); I am those acts which sacrificers perform for<br>gratifying the deities; I am even the pourer of the sacrificial libation:<br>and I am the Havi or libation that is poured. I am the Adharyu. I am the<br>Kalpaka; and I am the highly sanctified sacrificial Havi. It is me whom<br>the Udgatri, in the great sacrifice, hymns by the sound of his songs. In<br>all rites of expiation, O Brahmana, the utterers of auspicious Mantras<br>and benedictions fraught with peace hymn my praises who am the artificer,<br>O foremost of regenerate ones, of the universe. Know, O best of<br>regenerate person, that Dharma is my eldest-born offspring, sprung from<br>my mind, O learned Brahmana, whose essence is compassion for all<br>creatures. Constantly transforming myself, I take birth in diverse wombs,<br>O best of men, for upholding that son of mine, with the aid of men now<br>existing in or departed from the world. Indeed, I do this for protecting<br>Righteousness and for establishing it. In those forms that I assume for<br>the purpose, I am known, O son of Bhrigu's race, in the three worlds as<br>Vishnu and Brahman and Sakra. I am the origin and I am the destruction of<br>all things. I am the creator of all existent objects and I am their<br>destroyer. Knowing no change myself, I am the destroyer of all those<br>creatures that live in sinfulness. In every Yuga I have to repair the<br>causeway of Righteousness, entering into diverse kinds of wombs from<br>desire of doing good to my creatures. When, O son of Bhrigu's race, I<br>live in the order of the deities, I then verily act in every respect as a<br>deity. When I live in the order of the Gandharvas, I then, O son of<br>Bhrigu's race, act in every respect as a Gandharva. When I live in the<br>order of the Nagas, I then act as a Naga, and when I live in the order of<br>Yakshas or that of Rakshasas, I act after the manner of that order. Born<br>now in the order of humanity, I must act as a human being. I appealed to<br>them (the Kauravas) most piteously. But stupefied as they were and<br>deprived of their senses, they refused to accept my words. I frightened<br>them, filled with wrath, referring to some great fear (as the consequence<br>of their slighting my message). But once more I showed themselves my<br>usual (human) form. Possessed as they were of unrighteousness, and<br>assailed by the virtue of Time, all of them have been righteously slain<br>in battle, and have, without doubt, gone to Heaven. The Pandavas also, O<br>best of Brahmanas, have acquired great fame. I have thus told thee all<br>that thou hadst asked me.'"
