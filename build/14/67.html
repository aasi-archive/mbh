                            "Vaisampayana said, 'After Kunti had sat up, Subhadra, beholding her<br>brother, began to weep aloud, and afflicted with excessive grief,<br>said,&#8212;'O thou of eyes like lotus petals, behold the grandson of Arjuna<br>of great intelligence. Alas, the Kuru race having been thinned, a child<br>has been born that is feeble and dead. The blade of grass (inspired into<br>a weapon of great efficacy), uplifted by Drona's son for compassing the<br>destruction of Bhimasena, fell upon Uttara and Vijaya and myself.[184]<br>Alas, that blade, O Kesava, is still existing unextracted in me, after<br>having pierced my heart, since I do not, O irresistible hero, behold this<br>child with (his sire who was) my son. What will the righteous-souled king<br>Yudhishthira the just say? What will Bhimasena and Arjuna and the two<br>sons of Madravati also say? Hearing that Abhimanyu's son was born and<br>dead, the Pandavas, O thou of Vrishni's race, will regard themselves as<br>cheated by Aswatthaman. Abhimanyu, O Krishna, was the favourite of all<br>the Pandava brothers, without doubt. Hearing this intelligence, what will<br>those heroes, vanquished by the weapon of Drona's son say? What grief, O<br>Janarddana, can be greater than this viz., that Abhimanyu's son should be<br>born dead! Bowing unto thee with my head, O Krishna, I seek to gratify<br>thee today. Behold, O foremost of men, these two standing here, viz.,<br>Pritha and Draupadi. When, O Madhava, the son of Drona sought to destroy<br>the embryos even in the wombs of the ladies of the Pandavas, at that<br>time, O grinder of foes, thou saidst in wrath unto Drona's son (ever<br>these words), 'O wretch of a Brahmana, O vilest of men, I shall<br>disappoint thy wish. I shall revive the son of Kiritin's son.' Hearing<br>these words of thine and well knowing thy puissance, I seek to gratify<br>thee, O irresistible hero. Let the son of Abhimanyu be revived. It having<br>pledged thyself previously thou dost not accomplish thy auspicious vow,<br>do thou then know for certain, O chief of the Vrishni race, that I shall<br>cast off my life. If, O hero, this son of Abhimanyu doth not revive when<br>thou, O irresistible one, art alive and near, of what other use wilt thou<br>be to me? Do thou, therefore, O irresistible one, revive this son of<br>Abhimanyu,&#8212;this child possessed of eyes similar to his,&#8212;'even as a<br>rain-charged cloud revives the lifeless crops (on a field). Thou, O<br>Kesava, art righteous-souled, truthful, and of prowess incapable of being<br>baffled. It behoveth thee, O chastiser of foes, to make thy words<br>truthful. If only thou wishest it, thou canst revive the three worlds (of<br>being) if dead. What need I say, therefore, of this darling child, born<br>but dead, of thy sister's son? I know thy puissance, O Krishna.<br>Therefore, do I solicit thee. Do thou show this great favour to the sons<br>of Pandu. It behoveth thee, O mighty-armed one, to show compassion to<br>this Uttara or to me, thinking that I am thy sister or even a mother that<br>hath lost her son, and one that hath thrown herself upon thy protection.'"
