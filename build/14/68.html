                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed, O king, (by his sister and others),<br>the slayer of Kesin, exceedingly afflicted by grief, answered,&#8212;'So be<br>it!'&#8212;These words were uttered with sufficient loudness and they<br>gladdened all the inmates of the inner apartments of the palace. The<br>puissant Krishna, that foremost of men, by uttering these words,<br>gladdened all the people assembled there, like one pouring cold water on<br>a person afflicted with sweat. He then quickly entered the lying-in room<br>in which thy sire was born. It was duly sanctified, O chief of men, with<br>many garlands of white flowers, with many well-filled water pots arranged<br>on every side; with charcoal, soaked in ghee, of Tinduka wood, and<br>mustard seeds, O thou of mighty arms; with shining weapons properly<br>arrayed, and several fires on every side. And it was peopled by many<br>agreeable and aged dames summoned for waiting (upon thy grandmother). It<br>was also surrounded by many well-skilled and clever physicians, O thou of<br>great intelligence. Endued with great energy, he also saw there all<br>articles that are destructive of Rakshasas, duly placed by persons<br>conversant with the subject. Beholding the lying-in room in which thy<br>sire was born thus equipt, Hrishikesa became very glad and<br>said,&#8212;'Excellent, Excellent!' When he of Vrishni's race said so and<br>presented such a cheerful countenance, Draupadi, repairing thither with<br>great speed, addressed the daughter of Virata, saying,&#8212;'O blessed lady,<br>here comes to thee thy father-in-law, the slayer of Madhu, that ancient<br>Rishi of inconceivable soul, that unvanquished one.'&#8212;Virata's daughter,<br>checking her tears, said these words in a voice suffocated with grief.<br>Covering herself properly, the princess waited for Krishna like the<br>deities reverentially waiting for him. The helpless lady, with heart<br>agitated by grief, beholding Govinda coming, indulged in these<br>lamentations; O lotus-eyed one, behold us two deprived of our child. O<br>Janarddana, both Abhimanyu and myself have been equally slain. O thou of<br>Vrishni's race, O slayer of Madhu, I seek to gratify thee by bending my<br>head, O hero, unto thee. Do thou revive this child of mine that has been<br>consumed by the weapon of Drona's son. If king Yudhishthira the just, or<br>Bhimasena, or thyself, O lotus-eyed one, had, on that occasion, said,<br>'Let the blade of grass (inspired by Aswatthaman into a Brahma-weapon)<br>destroy the unconscious mother'&#8212;O puissant one, then I would have been<br>destroyed and this (sad occurrence) would not have happened. Alas, what<br>benefit has been reaped by Drona's son by accomplishing this cruel deed,<br>viz., the destruction of the child in the womb by his Brahma-weapon. The<br>self-same mother now seeks to gratify thee, O slayer of foes, by bending<br>her head. Surely, O Govinda, I shall cast off my life-breaths if this<br>child does not revive. In him, O righteous one, were placed many<br>expectations by me. Alas, when these have been frustrated by Drona's son,<br>what need have I, O Kesava, to bear, the burden of life? The hope, O<br>Krishna, was cherished by me that with my child on my lap, O Janarddana,<br>I would salute thee with reverence. Alas, O Kesava, that hope has been<br>destroyed. O foremost of all beings, at the death of this heir of<br>Abhimanyu of restless eyes, all the hopes in my breast have been<br>destroyed. Abhimanyu of restless eyes, O slayer of Madhu, was exceedingly<br>dear to thee. Behold this child of his slain by the Brahma-weapon. This<br>child is very ungrateful and very heartless, like his sire, for, behold,<br>disregarding the prosperity and affluence of the Pandavas, he has gone to<br>Yama's abode. I had, before this, vowed, O Kesava, that if Abhimanyu fell<br>on the field of battle, O hero, I would follow him without any loss of<br>time. I did not, however, keep my vow, cruel that I am and fond of life.<br>If I repair to him now, what, indeed, will Phalguna's son say?'"
