                            "Brahmana said, 'Well then, I shall declare to you what you ask. Learn<br>what was told by a preceptor to a disciple that came unto him. Hearing it<br>all, do you settle properly (what it should be). Abstention from harming<br>any creature is regarded as the foremost of all duties. That is the<br>highest seat, free from anxiety and constituting an indication of<br>holiness. The ancients who were beholders of the certain truth, have said<br>that knowledge is the highest happiness. Hence, one becomes released of<br>all sins by pure knowledge. They that are engaged in destruction and<br>harm, they that are infidels in conduct, have to go to Hell in<br>consequence of their being endued with cupidity and delusion. Those who,<br>without procrastination, perform acts, impelled thereto by expectation<br>become repeatedly born in this world and sport in joy. Those men who,<br>endued with learning and wisdom, perform acts with faith, free from<br>expectations, and possessed of concentration of mind, are said to<br>perceive clearly. I shall, after this, declare how the association and<br>the dissociation takes place of Kshetrajna and Nature. Ye best of men,<br>listen. The relation here is said to be that between the object and the<br>subject.[147] Purusha is always the subject; and Nature has been said to<br>be the object. It has been explained, by what has been said in a previous<br>portion of the discourse where it has been pointed out, that they exist<br>after the manner of the Gnat and the Udumbara. An object of enjoyment as<br>it is, Nature is unintelligent and knows nothing. He, however, who enjoys<br>it, is said to know it. Kshetrajna being enjoyer, Nature is enjoyed. The<br>wise have said that Nature is always made up of pairs of opposites (and<br>consists of qualities). Kshetrajna is, on the other hand, destitute of<br>pairs of opposites, devoid of parts, eternal, and free, as regards its<br>essence, from qualities. He resides in everything alike, and walks, with<br>knowledge. He always enjoys Nature, as a lotus leaf (enjoys) water.<br>Possessed of knowledge, he is never tainted even if brought into contact<br>with all the qualities. Without doubt, Purusha is unattached like the<br>unsteady drop of water on the lotus-leaf. This is the certain conclusion<br>(of the scriptures) that Nature is the property of Purusha. The relation<br>between these two (viz., Purusha and Nature) is like that existing<br>between matter and its maker. As one goes into a dark place taking a<br>light with him, even so those who wish for the Supreme proceed with the<br>light of Nature.[148] As long as matter and quality (which are like oil<br>and wick) exist, so long the light shines. The flame, however, becomes<br>extinguished when matter and quality (or oil and wick) are exhausted.<br>Thus Nature is manifest; while Purusha is said to be unmanifest.<br>Understand this, ye learned Brahmanas. Well, I shall now tell you<br>something more. With even a thousand (explanations), one that has a bad<br>understanding succeeds not in acquiring knowledge. One, however, that is<br>endued with intelligence succeeds in attaining happiness, through only a<br>fourth share (of explanations). Thus should the accomplishment of duty be<br>understood as dependent on means. For the man of intelligence, having<br>knowledge of means, succeeds in attaining to supreme felicity. As some<br>man travelling along a road without provisions for his journey, proceeds<br>with great discomfort and may even meet with destruction before he<br>reaches the end of his journey, even so should it be known that ill acts<br>there may not be fruits.[149] The examination of what is agreeable and<br>what is disagreeable in one's own self is productive of benefit.[150] The<br>progress in life of a man that is devoid of the perception of truth is<br>like that of a man who rashly journeys on a long road unseen before. The<br>progress, however, of those that are endued with intelligence is like<br>that of men who journey along the same road, riding on a car unto which<br>are yoked (fleet) steeds and which moves with swiftness. Having ascended<br>to the top of a mountain, one should not cast one's eyes on the surface<br>of the earth.[151] Seeing a man, even though travelling on a car,<br>afflicted and rendered insensible by pain, the man of intelligence<br>journeys on a car as long as there is a car path.[152] The man of<br>learning, when he sees the car path end, abandons his car for going on.<br>Even thus proceeds the man of intelligence who is conversant with the<br>ordinances respecting truth and Yoga (or Knowledge and Devotion).<br>Conversant with the qualities, such a man proceeds, comprehending what is<br>next and next.[153] As one that plunges, without a boat, into the<br>terrible ocean, with only one's two arms, through delusion, undoubtedly<br>wishes for destruction; while the man of wisdom, conversant with<br>distinctions, goes into the water, with a boat equipt with oars, and soon<br>crosses the lake without fatigue, and having crossed it attains to the<br>other shore and casts off the boat, freed from the thought of meum. This<br>has been already explained by the illustration of the car and the<br>pedestrian. One who has been overwhelmed by delusion in consequence of<br>attachment, adheres to it like a fisherman to his boat. Overcome by the<br>idea of meum, one wanders within its narrow range. After embarking on a<br>boat it is not possible in moving about on land. Similarly, it is not<br>possible in moving about on water after one has mounted on a car. There<br>are thus various actions with regard to various objects. And as action is<br>performed in this world, so does it result to those that perform them.<br>That which is void of smell, void of taste, and void of touch and sound,<br>that which is meditated upon by the sages with the aid of their<br>understanding, is said to be Pradhana. Now, Pradhana is unmanifest. A<br>development of the unmanifest is Mahat. A development of Pradhana when it<br>has become Mahat is Egoism. From egoism is produced the development<br>called the great elements. And of the great elements respectively, the<br>objects of sense are said to be the developments. The unmanifest is of<br>the nature of seed. It is productive in its essence. It has been heard by<br>us that the great soul has the virtues of a seed, and that is a product.<br>Egoism is of the nature of seed and is a product again and again. And the<br>five great elements are of the nature of seed and products. The objects<br>of the five great elements are endued with the nature of seed, and yield<br>products. These have Chitta for their property. Among them, space has one<br>quality; wind is said to have two. Light, it is said, is endued with<br>three qualities; and water as possessed of four qualities. Earth, teeming<br>with mobiles and immobiles, should be known as possessed of five<br>qualities. She is a goddess that is the source of all entities and<br>abounds with examples of the agreeable and the disagreeable. Sound,<br>likewise touch, colour, taste, and smell numbering the fifth,&#8212;these are<br>the five qualities of earth, ye foremost of regenerate persons. Smell<br>always belongs to earth, and smell is said to be of various kinds. I<br>shall state at length the numerous qualities of smell. Smell is agreeable<br>or disagreeable, sweet, sour, pungent, diffusive and compact, oily and<br>dry, and clear. Thus smell, which belongs to the earth, should be known<br>as of ten kinds.[154] Sound, touch, likewise colour, and taste have been<br>said to be the qualities of water. I shall now speak of the qualities of<br>Taste. Taste has been said to be of various kinds. Sweet, sour, pungent,<br>bitter, astringent, and saline likewise. Taste, which has been said to<br>appertain to water, is thus of six varieties. Sound, touch, and likewise<br>colour,&#8212;these are the three qualities which light is said to be<br>possessed of. Colour is the quality of light, and colour is said to be of<br>various kinds. White, dark, likewise red, blue, yellow, and grey also,<br>and short, long, minute, gross, square and circular, of these twelve<br>varieties in colour which belongs to light. These should be understood by<br>Brahmanas venerable for years, conversant with duties, and truthful in<br>speech. Sound and touch should be known as the two qualities of wind.<br>Touch has been said to be of various kinds. Rough, cold and like wise<br>hot, tender and clear, hard, oily, smooth, slippery, painful and soft, of<br>twelve kinds is touch, which is the quality of wind, as said by Brahmanas<br>crowned with success, conversant with duties, and possessed of a sight of<br>truth. Now space has only one quality, and that is said to be sound. I<br>shall speak at length of the numerous qualities of sound. Shadaja,<br>Rishabha, together with Gandhara, Madhyama, and likewise Panchama; after<br>this should be known Nishada, and then Dhaivata.[155] Besides these,<br>there are agreeable sounds and disagreeable sounds, compact, and of many<br>ingredients. Sound which is born of space should thus be known to be of<br>ten kinds. Space is the highest of the (five) elements. Egoism is above<br>it. Above egoism is understanding. Above understanding is the soul. Above<br>the soul is the Unmanifest. Above the Unmanifest is Purusha. One who<br>knows which is superior and inferior among existent creatures, who is<br>conversant with the ordinances in respect of all acts, and who<br>constitutes himself the soul of all creatures, attains to the Unfading<br>Soul.'"
