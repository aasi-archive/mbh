                            "Vasudeva said, 'O thou of Vrishni's race, I have repeatedly heard men<br>speaking of the wonderful battle (between the Kurus and the Pandavas).<br>Thou, however, O mighty-armed one, hast witnessed it with thy own eyes.<br>Do thou, therefore, O sinless one, describe the battle in detail. Indeed,<br>tell me how that battle took place between the high-souled Pandavas (on<br>the one side) and Bhishma and Karna and Kripa and Drona and Salya and<br>others (on the other side), between, in fact, numerous other Kshatriyas<br>well-skilled in aims, differing from one another in mien and attire, and<br>hailing from diverse realms.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by his sire, he of eyes like<br>lotus-petals narrated, in the presence of his mother also, how the<br>Kaurava heroes had been slain in battle.'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'The feats were highly wonderful that were achieved by<br>those high-souled Kshatriyas. In consequence of their large number, they<br>are incapable of being enumerated in even hundreds of years. I shall<br>however, mention only the foremost of them. Do thou listen, therefore, to<br>me as I mention in brief those feats achieved by the kings of Earth. O<br>thou of godlike splendour. Bhishma of Kuru's race became the<br>generalissimo, having eleven divisions of the Kaurava princes under his<br>command, like Vasava of the celestial forces.[176] Sikhandin of great<br>intelligence, protected by the blessed Arjuna, became the leader of the<br>seven divisions of the sons of Pandu. The battle between the Kurus and<br>the Pandavas (under these leaders) raged for ten days. It was so fierce<br>as to make one's hair stand on its end. Then Sikhandin, in great battle,<br>aided by the wielder of Gandiva, slew, with innumerable arrows, the son<br>of Ganga fighting bravely. Lying on a bed of arrows, Bhishma waited like<br>an ascetic till the sun leaving his southward path entered on his<br>northerly course when that hero gave up his life-breaths. Then Drona,<br>that foremost of all persons conversant with arms, that greatest of men<br>under Duryodhana, like Kavya himself of the lord of the Daityas, became<br>generalissimo.[177] That foremost of regenerate persons, ever boasting of<br>his prowess in battle, was supported by the remnant of the Kaurava force<br>consisting then of nine Akshauhinis, and protected by Kripa and Vrisha<br>and others. Dhrishtadyumna conversant with many mighty weapons, and<br>possessed of great intelligence, became the leader of the Pandavas. He<br>was protected by Bhima like Varuna protected by Mitra. That high-souled<br>hero, always desirous of measuring his strength with Drona, supported by<br>the (remnant of the) Pandava army, and recollecting the wrongs inflicted<br>(by Drona) on his sire (Drupada, the king of the Panchalas), achieved<br>great feats in battle. In that encounter between Drona and the son of<br>Prishata, the kings assembled from diverse realms were nearly<br>exterminated. That furious battle lasted for five days. At the conclusion<br>of that period, Drona, exhausted, succumbed to Dhrishtadyumna. After<br>that, Karna became the generalissimo of Duryodhana's forces. He was<br>supported in battle by the remnant of the Kaurava host which numbered<br>five Akshauhinis. Of the sons of Pandu there were then three Akshauhinis.<br>After the slaughter of innumerable heroes, protected by Arjuna, they came<br>to battle. The Suta's son Karna, though a fierce warrior, encountering<br>Partha, came to his end on the second day, like an insect encountering a<br>blazing fire. After the fall of Karna, the Kauravas became dispirited and<br>lost all energy. Numbering three Akshauhinis, they gathered round the<br>ruler of the Madras. Having lost many car-warriors and elephants and<br>horsemen, the remnant of the Pandava army, numbering one Akshauhini and<br>penetrated with cheerlessness, supported Yudhishthira (as their leader).<br>The king Yudhishthira, in the battle that ensued, achieved the most<br>difficult feats and slew, before half the day was over, the king of the<br>Madras. After the fall of Salya, the high-souled Sahadeva of immeasurable<br>prowess slew Sakuni, the man who had brought about the quarrel (between<br>the Pandavas and the Kurus). After the fall of Sakuni, the royal son of<br>Dhritarashtra, whose army had suffered an extensive carnage and who on<br>that account had become exceedingly cheerless, fled from the field, armed<br>with his mace. Then Bhimasena of great prowess, filled with wrath,<br>pursued him and discovered him within the waters of the Dwaipayana lake.<br>With the remnant of their army, the Pandavas surrounded the lake and,<br>filled with joy, encountered Duryodhana concealed within the waters.<br>Their wordy shafts, penetrating through the waters, pierced Duryodhana.<br>Rising up from the lake, the latter approached the Pandavas, armed with<br>his mace, desirous of battle. Then, in the great battle that ensued, the<br>royal son of Dhritarashtra was slain by Bhimasena who put forth his great<br>prowess, in the presence of many kings. After this the remnant of the<br>Pandava army, as it slept in the camp, was slaughtered at night time by<br>Drona's son who was unable to put up with the slaughter of his father (at<br>the hands of Dhrishtadyumna). Their sons slain, their forces slain, only<br>the five sons of Pandu are alive with myself and Yuyudhana. With Kripa<br>and the Bhoja prince Kritavarman, the son of Drona represents the unslain<br>remnant of the Kaurava army. Dhritarashtra's son Yuyutsu also escaped<br>slaughter in consequence of his having adopted the side of the Pandavas.<br>Upon the slaughter of the Kaurava king (Suyodhana) with all his followers<br>and allies, Vidura and Sanjaya have come to the presence of king<br>Yudhishthira the just. Even thus did that battle occur, O lord, for eight<br>and ten days. Many kings of Earth, slain therein, have ascended to<br>Heaven.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The Vrishnis, as they heard, O king, that<br>dreadful account became filled with grief and sorrow and pain.'
