                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having heard these words of his son Vasudeva, that<br>descendant of Sura, of righteous soul, casting off his grief, made<br>excellent obsequial offerings (unto Abhimanyu). Vasudeva also performed<br>those rites for the ascension (to Heaven) of his high-souled nephew, that<br>hero who was ever the darling of his sire (Vasudeva). He duly fed six<br>millions of Brahmanas, endued with great energy, with edibles possessed<br>of every recommendation. Presenting many clothes unto them, Krishna<br>gratified the thirst for wealth of those Brahmanas. Wonderful were the<br>heaps of gold, the number of kine and of beds and clothes, that were then<br>given away. The Brahmanas loudly declared&#8212;'Let (Krishna's wealth)<br>increase.' Then Vasudeva of Dasarha's race, and Valadeva, and Satyaki,<br>and Satyaka, each performed the obsequial rites of Abhimanyu. Exceedingly<br>afflicted with grief, they failed to attain comfort. The same was the<br>case with the sons of Pandu in the city called after the elephant.<br>Deprived of Abhimanyu, they failed to obtain peace of mind. The daughter<br>of Virata, O monarch, for many days, totally abstained from all food,<br>exceedingly afflicted by grief on account of the death of her husband. At<br>this all her relatives became plunged into excess of grief. They all<br>feared that the embryo in her womb might be destroyed. Then Vyasa,<br>ascertaining the state of things by his spiritual vision, came there. The<br>highly intelligent Rishi, endued with great energy, arrived (at the<br>palace), addressed Pritha of large eyes, as also Uttara herself,<br>saying,&#8212;'Let this grief be abandoned. O famous lady, a son endued with<br>mighty energy will be born to thee, through the puissance of Vasudeva and<br>at my word. That son will rule the Earth after the Pandavas (have<br>departed from it).' Beholding Dhananjaya, he said unto him, in the<br>hearing of king Yudhishthira the just, and gladdening him with his words,<br>'O Bharata.&#8212;'The grandson, O highly blessed one, will become a<br>high-souled prince. He will righteously rule the whole Earth to the verge<br>of the sea. Therefore, O foremost one of Kuru's race, cast off this<br>grief, O mower of foes. Do not doubt this. This will truly happen. That<br>which was uttered by the Vrishni hero on a former occasion, will, without<br>doubt, happen. Do not think otherwise. As regards Abhimanyu, he has gone<br>to the regions of the deities, conquered by him with his own acts. That<br>hero should not be grieved for by thee or, indeed, by the other Kurus.'<br>Thus addressed by his grandsire, Dhananjaya of righteous soul, O king,<br>cast off his grief and even became cheerful. Thy sire, O prince, that art<br>conversant with all duties, began to grow in that womb, O thou of great<br>intelligence, like the Moon in the lighted fortnight. Then Vyasa urged<br>the royal son of Dharma for performing the horse-sacrifice. Having said<br>so, he made himself invisible there and then. The intelligent king<br>Yudhishthira the just, hearing the words of Vyasa, set his mind on the<br>journey for bringing wealth (for the sacrifice).'"
