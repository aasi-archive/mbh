                            "Vaisampayana said, 'After this, Krishna ordered Daruka, saying&#8212;Let my<br>car be yoked.&#8212;Within a very short space of time Daruka informed (his<br>master), saying,&#8212;It has been yoked.&#8212;The son of Pandu then commanded all<br>his attendants, saying,&#8212;Prepare yourselves and be ready. We shall repair<br>to-day to the city named after the elephant. Thus addressed, O king,<br>those troops accoutred themselves, and informed Pritha's son of<br>immeasurable energy, saying,&#8212;Everything is equipt. Then those two, viz.,<br>Krishna and the son of Pandu, ascended their car and proceeded on the<br>journey, the loving friends engaged the while in delightful conversation.<br>Unto Vasudeva seated on the car, Dhananjaya of great energy once more<br>said these words, O chief of Bharata's race!&#8212;O perpetuator of the<br>Vrishni race, the king has obtained victory through thy grace. All his<br>foes have been slain, and he has recovered his kingdom without a thorn in<br>it (to make it disagreeable). O slayer of Madhu, through thee the<br>Pandavas are endued with a powerful protector. Having obtained thee for<br>our raft we have crossed the Kuru ocean. O thou that hast this universe<br>for thy handiwork, salutations to thee, O Soul of the universe, O best of<br>all beings in the universe. I know thee in that measure in which I am<br>approved by thee.[165] O slayer of Madhu, the soul of every creature is<br>always born of thy energy. Playful sport (in the from of creation,<br>preservation, and destruction) is thine. Earth and sky, O lord, are thy<br>illusion. This whole universe, consisting of mobile and immobile objects,<br>is established on thee. Thou createst, by modification, the four orders<br>of Being (viz., viviparous, oviparous, filth-born, and vegetables). Thou<br>createst the Earth, the Welkin, and Heaven, O slayer of Madhu. The<br>stainless lunar light is thy smile. The seasons are thy senses. The<br>ever-moving wind is thy breath, and death, existing eternally, is thy<br>wrath. In thy grace is the goddess of prosperity. Verily, Sree is always<br>established in thee, O thou of the highest intelligence. Thou art the<br>sport (in which creatures engage); thou art their contentment; thou their<br>intelligence, thou their forgiveness, thou their inclinations, thou their<br>beauty. Thou art the universe with its mobile and immobile objects. At<br>the end of the cycle, it is thou, O sinless one, that art called<br>destruction. I am incapable of reciting all thy qualities in course of<br>even a long period. Thou art the Soul and the Supreme Soul. I bow to<br>thee, O thou of eyes like the petals of the lotus. O thou that art<br>irresistible, I have learnt it from Narada and Devala and the Island-born<br>(Vyasa), and the Kuru grandsire also, that all this (universe) rests on<br>thee. Thou art the one Lord of all creatures. This, O sinless one, that<br>thou hast declared unto me in consequence of thy favour for myself, I<br>shall duly accomplish in its entirety, O Janarddana. Exceedingly<br>wonderful is this which thou hast done from desire of doing what is<br>agreeable to us, viz., the destruction in battle of the Kaurava (prince),<br>the son of Dhritarashtra. Thai host had been burnt by thee which I<br>(subsequently) vanquished in battle. That feat was achieved by thee in<br>consequence of which victory became mine. By the power of thy<br>intelligence was shown the means by which was duly affected the<br>destruction of Duryodhana in battle, as also of Karna, as of the sinful<br>icing of the Sindhus; and Bhurisravas. I shall accomplish all that which,<br>O son of Devaki, pleased with me thou hast declared to myself. I do not<br>entertain any scruple in this. Repairing to king Yudhishthira of<br>righteous soul, I shall, O sinless one, urge him to dismiss thee, O thou<br>that art conversant with every duty. O lord, thy departure for Dwaraka<br>meets with my approbation. Thou shalt soon see my maternal uncle, O<br>Janarddana. Thou shalt also see the irresistible Valadeva and other<br>chiefs of the Vrishni race.&#8212;Thus conversing with each other, the two<br>reached the city named after the elephant. They then, with cheerful<br>hearts, and without any anxiety, entered the palace of Dhritarashtra<br>which resembled the mansion of Sakra. They then saw, O monarch, king<br>Dhritarashtra, and Vidura of great intelligence, and king Yudhishthira<br>and the irresistible Bhimasena, and the two sons of Madri by Pandu; and<br>the unvanquished Yuyatsu, seated before Dhritarashtra and Gandhari of<br>great wisdom, and Pritha, and the beautiful Krishna, and the other ladies<br>of Bharata's race with Subhadra counting first. They also saw all those<br>ladies that used to wait upon Gandhari. Then approaching king<br>Dhritarashtra, those two chastisers of foes announced their names and<br>touched his feet. Indeed, those high-souled ones also touched the feet of<br>Gandhari and Pritha and king Yudhishthira the Just, and Bhima. Embracing<br>Vidura also, they enquired after his welfare. In the company of all those<br>persons, Arjuna and Krishna then approached king Dhritarashtra (again).<br>Night came and then king Dhritarashtra of great intelligence dismissed<br>all those perpetuators of Kuru's race as also Janarddana for retiring to<br>their respective chambers. Permitted by the king all of them entered<br>their respective apartments. Krishna of great energy proceeded to the<br>apartments of Dhananjaya. Worshipped duly and furnished with every object<br>of comfort and enjoyment, Krishna of great intelligence passed the night<br>in happy sleep with Dhananjaya as his companion. When the night passed<br>away and morning came, the two heroes, finishing their morning rites and<br>dealing their persons properly, proceeded to the mansion of king<br>Yudhishthira the just. There Yudhishthira the just, of great might, sat<br>with his ministers. The two high-souled ones, entering that well-adorned<br>chamber, beheld king Yudhishthira the just like the two Aswins beholding<br>the chief of the celestials. Meeting the king, he of Vrishni's race as<br>also that foremost hero of Kuru's race, obtaining the permission of<br>Yudhishthira who was highly pleased with them, sat themselves down. Then<br>the king, gifted with great intelligence, seeing those two friends,<br>became desirous of addressing them. Soon that best of monarchs, that<br>foremost of speakers addressed them in the following words.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Ye heroes, ye foremost ones of Yadu's and Kuru's<br>race, it seems that ye two are desirous of saying something to me. Do ye<br>say what is in your mind. I shall soon accomplish it. Do not hesitate.'<br><br>"Thus addressed, Phalguna, well conversant with speech, humbly approached<br>king Yudhishthira the just and then said these words.&#8212;'Vasudeva here, of<br>great prowess, O king, is long absent from home. He desires, with thy<br>permission, to see his sire. Let him go, if thou thinkest it meet, to the<br>city of the Anarttas. It behoveth thee; O hero, to grant him permission!'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O lotus-eyed one, blessed be thou. O slayer of<br>Madhu, do thou go this very day to the city of Dwaravati for seeing, O<br>puissant one, that foremost one of Sura's race. O mighty-armed Kesava,<br>thy departure is approved by me. Thou hast not seen my maternal uncle as<br>also the goddess Devaki, for a long time. Meeting my maternal uncle and<br>repairing to Valadeva also, O giver of honours, thou wilt, O thou of<br>great wisdom, worship both of them at my word as they deserve.[166] Do<br>thou also think of me daily as also of Bhima, that foremost of mighty<br>men, and of Phalguna and Nakula and Sahadeva, O giver of honours. Having<br>seen the Anarttas, and thy sire, O mighty-armed one, and the Vrishnis,<br>thou wilt come back to my horse-sacrifice, O sinless one. Do thou then<br>depart, taking with thee diverse kinds of gems and various sorts of<br>wealth. Do thou, O hero of the Satwata race, also take with thee whatever<br>else thou likest. It is through thy grace, O Kesava, that the whole<br>Earth, O hero, has come under our dominion and all our foes have been<br>slain.'<br><br>When king Yudhishthira the just of Kuru's race said so, Vasudeva, that<br>foremost of men, said these words (in reply).<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'O mighty-armed one, all jewels and gems, all wealth, and<br>the entire Earth, are thine and thine alone. Whatever wealth exists in<br>my, abode, thou, O lord, art always the owner thereof.' Unto him<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, said,&#8212;'Be it so'&#8212;and then duly<br>worshipped (Krishna) the eldest brother, endued with great energy, of<br>Gada. Vasudeva then proceeded to his paternal aunt (Kunti). Duly<br>honouring her, he circumambulated her person. He was properly accosted by<br>her in return, and then by all the others having Vidura for their first.<br>The four-armed eldest brother of Gada then set out from Nagapura on his<br>excellent car.[167] Placing his sister, the lady Subhadra, on the car,<br>the mighty-armed Janarddana then, with the permission of both<br>Yudhishthira and (Kunti) his paternal aunt, set out, accompanied by a<br>large train of citizens. The hero who had the foremost of apes on his<br>banner, as also Satyaki, and the two sons of Madravati, and Vidura of<br>immeasurable intelligence, and Bhima himself whose tread resembled that<br>of a prince of elephants, all followed Madhava. Janarddana of mighty<br>energy causing all those extenders of the Kuru kingdom and Vidura also to<br>return, addressed Daraka, and Satyaki, saying,&#8212;'Urge the steeds to<br>speed.' Then that grinder of hostile masses, viz., Janarddana of great<br>prowess, accompanied by Satyaki, the foremost one of Sini's race,<br>proceeded to the city of the Anarttas, after having slain all his foes,<br>like He of a hundred sacrifices proceeding to Heaven (after slaughtering<br>all his foes).'
