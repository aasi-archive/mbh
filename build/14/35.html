                            "Arjuna said, 'It behoveth thee to expound Brahma to me,&#8212;that which is<br>the highest object of knowledge. Through thy favour, my mind is delighted<br>with these subtle disquisitions.'<br><br>"Vasudeva said,&#8212;'In this connection is recited the old history of the<br>discourse between a preceptor and his disciple on the subject of Brahman.<br>Once on a time, O scorcher of foes, an intelligent disciple questioned a<br>certain Brahmana of rigid vows who was his preceptor, as he was seated<br>(at his ease), saying,&#8212;What, indeed, is the highest good? Desirous of<br>attaining to that which constitutes the highest good, I throw myself at<br>thy feet, O holy one. O learned Brahmana, I solicit thee, bending my<br>head, to explain to me what I ask.&#8212;Unto that disciple, O son of Pritha,<br>who said so, the preceptor said,&#8212;O regenerate one, I shall explain to<br>thee everything about which thou mayst have any doubts.&#8212;Thus addressed,<br>O foremost one of Kuru's race, by his preceptor, that disciple who was<br>exceedingly devoted to his preceptor, spoke as follows, with joined<br>hands. Do thou hear what he said, O thou of great intelligence.'<br><br>"The Disciple said, 'Where am I? Whence art thou? Explain that which is<br>the highest truth. From what source have sprung all creatures mobile and<br>immobile? By what do creatures live? What is the limit of their life?<br>What is truth? What is penance, O learned Brahmana? What are called<br>attributes by the good? What paths are to be called auspicious? What is<br>happiness? What is sin? O holy one, O thou of excellent vows, it behoves<br>thee to answer these questions of mine, O learned Rishi, correctly,<br>truly, and accurately. Who else is there in this world than thee that is<br>capable of answering these questions? Do thou answer them, O foremost of<br>all persons conversant with duties. My curiosity is great. Thou art<br>celebrated in all the worlds as one well skilled in the duties relating<br>to Emancipation. There is none else than thou that is competent to remove<br>all kinds of doubts. Afraid of worldly life, we have become desirous of<br>achieving Emancipation.'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'Unto that disciple who had humbly sought his instruction<br>and put the questions duly, who was devoted to his preceptor and<br>possessed of tranquillity, and who always behaved in a manner that was<br>agreeable (to his instructor), who lived so constantly by the side of his<br>instructor as to have almost become his shadow, who was self-restrained,<br>and who had the life of a Yati and Brahmacharin, O son of Pritha, that<br>preceptor possessed of intelligence and observant of vows, duly explained<br>all the questions, O foremost one of Kuru's race, O chastiser of all<br>foes.'<br><br>"The preceptor said, 'All this was declared (In days of old) by Brahma<br>himself (the Grandsire of all the worlds). Applauded and practised by the<br>foremost of Rishis, and depending on a knowledge of the Vedas, it<br>involves a consideration of what constitutes the real entity. We regard<br>knowledge to be the highest object, and renunciation as the best penance.<br>He who, with certainty, knows the true object of knowledge which is<br>incapable of being modified by circumstances, viz., the soul abiding in<br>all creatures, succeeds in going whithersoever he wishes and comes to be<br>regarded as the highest. That learned man who beholds the residence of<br>all things in one place and their severance as well, and who sees unity<br>in diversity, succeeds in freeing himself from misery. He who does not<br>covet anything and does not cherish the idea of mineness with regard to<br>anything, comes to be regarded, although residing in this world, as<br>identifiable with Brahman, He who is conversant with the truth about the<br>qualities of Pradhana (or Nature), acquainted with the creation of all<br>existent objects, divested of the idea of mineness, and without pride,<br>succeeds, without doubt, in emancipating himself. Understanding properly<br>that great tree which has the unmanifest for its seed sprout, and the<br>understanding for its trunk, and high consciousness of self for its<br>branches, and the senses for the cells whence its twigs issue, and the<br>(five) great elements for its flower-buds, and the gross elements for its<br>smaller boughs, which is always endued with leaves, which always puts<br>forth flowers, and upon which all existent objects depend, whose seed is<br>Brahman, and which is eternal,&#8212;and cutting all topics with the sharp<br>sword of knowledge, one attains to immortality and casts off birth and<br>death. The conclusions with regard to the past, present, and future, etc,<br>and religion, pleasure and wealth, which are all well known to conclaves<br>of Siddhas, which appertain to remote cycles, and which are, indeed,<br>eternal, I shall declare to thee, O thou of great wisdom. These<br>constitute what is called Good. Men of wisdom, understanding them in this<br>world, attain to success. In days of old, the Rishis Vrihaspati and<br>Bharadwaja, and Gautama and Bhargava, and Vasishtha and Kasyapa, and<br>Viswamitra, and Atri, assembled together for the purpose of asking one<br>another. They thus assembled together after having travelled over all<br>paths and after they had got tired with the acts each of them had done.<br>Those regenerate persons, placing the sage son of Angiras at their head,<br>proceeded to the region of the Grandsire. There they beheld Brahma<br>perfectly cleansed of all sin. Bowing their heads unto that high-souled<br>one who was seated at his ease, the great Rishis, endued with humility,<br>asked him this grave question regarding the highest good. How should a<br>good man act? How would one be released from sin? What paths are<br>auspicious for us? What is truth, and what is sin? By what action are the<br>two paths, northern and southern, obtained? What is destruction? What is<br>Emancipation? What is birth and what is death of all existent objects? I<br>shall tell thee, O disciple, what the Grandsire, thus addressed, said<br>unto them, conformably to the scriptures. Do thou listen.'<br><br>"Brahma said, 'It is from Truth that all creatures, mobile and immobile,<br>have been born. They live by penance (of action). Understand this, O ye<br>of excellent vows. In consequence of their own actions they live,<br>transcending: their own origin.[101] For Truth, when united with<br>qualities, becomes always possessed of five indications. Brahman is<br>Truth. Penance is truth. Prajapati is truth. It is from Truth that all<br>creatures have sprung. Truth is the universe of being. It is for this<br>that Brahmanas who are always devoted to Yoga, who have transcended wrath<br>and sorrow, and who always regard Religion as the causeway (along which<br>every one must pass for avoiding the morass below), take refuge in Truth.<br>I shall now speak of those Brahmanas who are restrained by one another<br>and possessed of knowledge, of the orders, and of those who belong to the<br>four modes of life. The wise say that Religion or duty is one, (though)<br>having four quarters. Ye regenerate ones, I shall speak to ye now of that<br>path which is auspicious and productive of good. That path has constantly<br>been trod over by men possessed of wisdom in order to achieve an identity<br>with Brahman. I shall speak now of that path which is the highest and<br>which is exceedingly difficult of being understood. Do you understand, in<br>all its details, ye highly blessed ones, what is the highest seat. The<br>first step has been said to be the mode of life that appertains to<br>Brahmacharins. The second step is domesticity. After this is the<br>residence in the woods. After that it should be known is the highest<br>step, viz., that relating to Adhyatma.[102] Light, ether (or space), sun,<br>wind, Indra, and Prajapati,&#8212;one sees these as long as one does not<br>attain to Adhyatma. I shall declare the means (by which that Adhyatma may<br>be attained). Do ye first understand them. The forest mode of life that<br>is followed by ascetics residing in the woods and subsisting upon fruits<br>and roots and air is laid down for the three regenerate classes. The<br>domestic mode of life is ordained for all the orders. They that are<br>possessed of wisdom say that Religion or duty has Faith for its (chief)<br>indication. Thus have I declared to you the paths leading to the deities.<br>They are adopted by those that are good and wise by their acts. Those<br>paths are the causeways of piety. That person of rigid vows who adopts<br>any one of these modes separately, always succeeds in time to understand<br>the production and destruction of all creatures. I shall now declare,<br>accurately and with reasons, the elements which reside in parts in all<br>objects. The great soul, the unmanifest, egoism (consciousness of<br>identity), the ten and one organs (of knowledge and action), the five<br>great elements, the specific characteristics of the five elements,&#8212;these<br>constitute the eternal creation. The number of elements has been said to<br>be four and twenty, and one (more). That person of wisdom who understands<br>the production and destruction of all these elements, that man among all<br>creatures, never meets with delusion. He who understands the elements<br>accurately, all the qualities, all the deities, succeeds in cleansing<br>himself of all sin. Freed from all bonds, such a man succeeds in enjoying<br>all regions of spotless purity.'"[103]
