                            "Arjuna said, 'What business brought thee here, O daughter (-in-law) of<br>Kuru's race, and what also is the cause of the arrival on the field of<br>battle of her who is the mother of the ruler of Manipura? Dost thou<br>entertain friendly motives towards this king, O daughter of a snake? O<br>thou of restless glances, dost thou wish good to me too? I hope, O thou<br>of ample hips, that neither I, nor this Vabhruvahana here, have, O<br>beautiful lady, done any injury to thee unconsciously? Has Chitrangada of<br>faultless limbs, descended from the race of Chitravahana, done thee any<br>wrong?' Unto him, the daughter of the prince of snakes answered<br>smilingly, 'Thou hast not offended me, nor has Vabhruvahana done me any<br>wrong; nor this prince's mother who is always obedient to me as a<br>hand-maid. Listen, how all this has been brought about by me. Thou<br>shouldst not be angry with me. Indeed, I seek to gratify thee by bending<br>my head in reverence. O thou of Kuru's race, all this has been done by me<br>for thy good, O puissant one. O mighty-armed Dhananjaya, hear all that I<br>have done. In the great battle of the Bharata princes, thou hadst slain<br>the royal son of Santanu by unrighteous ways. What I have done has<br>expiated thy sin. Thou didst not overthrow Bhishma while battling with<br>thee. He was engaged with Sikhandin. Relying on him as thy help, thou<br>didst compass the overthrow of Santanu's son. If thou hadst died without<br>having expiated thy sin, thou wouldst then have fallen without doubt into<br>Hell in consequence of that sinful act of thine. Even this which thou<br>hast got from thy son is the expiation of that sin. Formerly, O ruler of<br>Earth, I heard this said by the Vasus while they were in the company of<br>Ganga, O thou of great intelligence. After the fall of Santanu's son,<br>those deities, viz., the Vasus, coming to the banks of Ganga, bathed in<br>her waters, and calling the goddess of that stream, they uttered these<br>terrible words having the sanction of Bhagirathi herself,<br>viz.,&#8212;Santanu's son Bhishma has been slain by Dhananjaya. Verily, O<br>goddess, Bhishma then was engaged with another, and had ceased to fight.<br>For this fault we shall today denounce a curse on Dhananjaya.&#8212;To this,<br>the goddess Ganga readily assented, saying,&#8212;Be it so!&#8212;Hearing these<br>words I became very much afflicted and penetrating into the nether<br>regions represented everything to my sire. Informed of what had happened,<br>my sire became plunged in grief. Repairing to the Vasus, he solicited<br>them for thy sake, repeatedly gratifying them by every means in his<br>power. They then said unto him, 'Dhananjaya has a highly blessed son who,<br>endued with youth, is the ruler of Manipura. He will, standing on the<br>field of battle, cast Dhananjaya down on the Earth. When this will<br>happen, O prince of snakes, Arjuna will be freed from our curse. Do thou<br>go back.&#8212;Thus addressed by the Vasus, he came back and informed me of<br>what had happened. Having learnt all this, O hero, I have freed thee from<br>the curse of the Vasus even in this way. The chief of the deities himself<br>is incapable of vanquishing thee in battle. The son is one's own self. It<br>is for this that thou hast been vanquished by him. I cannot be held, O<br>puissant one, to have committed any fault. How, indeed, wouldst thou hold<br>me censurable?'&#8212;Thus addressed (by Ulupi), Vijaya became cheerful of<br>heart and said unto her, 'All this that thou hast done, O goddess, is<br>highly agreeable to me.' After this, Jaya addressed his son, the ruler of<br>Manipura, and said unto him in the hearing of Chitrangada, the daughter<br>(-in-law) of Kuru's house, the Horse-sacrifice of Yudhishthira will take<br>place on the day of full moon in the coming month of Chaitra. Come there,<br>O king, with thy mother and thy counsellors and officers.' Thus addressed<br>by Partha, king Vabhruvahana of great intelligence, with tearful eyes,<br>said these words to his sire, 'O thou that art conversant with every<br>duty, I shall certainly repair, at thy command, to the great<br>Horse-sacrifice, and take upon myself the task of distributing food among<br>the regenerate ones. For, however, showing thy grace towards me, thou<br>enter thy own city with thy two wives. Let no scruple, be thine as<br>regards this, O thou that art fully acquainted with every duty. O lord,<br>having lived for one night in thy own mansion in happiness, thou mayst<br>then follow the steed, O foremost of victorious warriors. The<br>ape-bannered son of Kunti, thus addressed by his son, answered the child<br>of Chitrangada, saying 'Thou knowest, O mighty-armed one, what vow I am<br>observing. O thou of large eyes, till the termination of this my vow, I<br>cannot enter thy city. O foremost of men, this sacrificial horse wanders<br>at will. (I have to follow it always.) Blessings on thee! I must go away.<br>Place I have none wherein to rest for even a short while.' The son of the<br>chastiser of Paka then, duly worshipped by his son and obtaining the<br>permission of his two wives, left the spot and proceeded on his way.'"
