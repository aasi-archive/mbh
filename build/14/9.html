                            "Indra said, "Dost thou, O Vrihaspati, sleep in peace, and are thy<br>servants agreeable to thee, dost thou seek the welfare of the gods, and<br>do the gods, O Brahmana, protect thee?"<br><br>Vrihaspati said, "I do sleep in peace in my bed. O Lord of the gods, and<br>my servants are to my liking and I always seek the welfare of the gods,<br>and they cherish me well."<br><br>Indra said, "Whence then is this pain, mental or physical, and why art<br>thou pale and altered in appearance (complexion) at present? Tell me, O<br>Brahmana, who those people are, who have caused thee pain, so that I may<br>kill them all."<br><br>Vrihaspati said, "O Indra, I have heard that Marutta will perform a great<br>sacrifice at which exquisite presents will be given by him (to Brahmanas)<br>and that at his sacrifice Samvarta will act as the officiating priest,<br>and therefore do I desire that he may not officiate as priest at that<br>sacrifice."<br><br>Indra said, "Thou, O Brahmana, hast attained all the object of thy desire<br>when thou hast become the excellent priest of the gods, versed in all the<br>sacred hymns, and hast overreached the influence of death and dotage,<br>what can Samvarta do to thee now?"<br><br>Vrihaspati said, "Prosperity of a rival is always painful to one's<br>feelings, and for this reason too, thou dost with try attendant gods<br>persecute the Asuras with their with and kin, and kill the most<br>prosperous among them; hence, O Lord of the gods, am I changed in<br>appearance at the thought that my rival is prospering, therefore, O<br>Indra, do thou, by all means, restrain Samvarta and king Marutta."<br><br>Indra turning to Agni said, "Do thou, O Jataveda, following my direction,<br>go to king Marutta to present Vrihaspati to him, and say unto him that<br>this Vrihaspati will officiate at his sacrifice and make him immortal."<br><br>Agni said, "I shall presently, O adorable one, repair thither as thy<br>messenger, to present Vrihaspati to king Marutta; and to make Indra's<br>words true, and to show respect to Vrihaspati, Agni departed."<br><br>Vyasa said, "Then the high-souled fire-god went on his errand,<br>devastating all the forests and trees, like unto the mighty wind, roaring<br>and revolving at random at the end of the winter season."<br><br>Marutta said, "Behold! I find the fire-god come in his own embodiment,<br>this day, therefore do thou, O Muni, offer him a seat and water, and a<br>cow, and water for washing the feet."<br><br>Agni said, "I accept thy offerings of water, seat, and water for washing<br>the feet, O sinless one, do thou know me as the messenger of Indra, come<br>to thee, in accordance with his directions."<br><br>Marutta said, "O Fire-god, is the glorious Lord of the Celestials happy,<br>and is he pleased with us, and are the other gods loyal to him? Do thou<br>enlighten me duly on all these points."<br><br>Agni said, "O lord of the earth, Sakra is perfectly happy, he is pleased<br>with thee, and wishes to make thee free from senility, and all the other<br>gods are loyal to him. Do thou, O king, listen to the message of the Lord<br>of the Celestials. And the object for which he has sent me to thee is to<br>present Vrihaspati to Marutta. O prince, let this priest (of the<br>Celestials) perform thy sacrifice, and make thee, who art only a mortal,<br>attain immortality."<br><br>Marutta said, "This twice-born Brahmana Samvarta will perform my<br>sacrifice, and I pray to Vrihaspati, that he having acted as priest to<br>Mahendra (Indra), it does not look well for him now to act as priest to<br>mortal men."<br><br>Agni said, "If this Vrihaspati officiate as thy priest, then shalt thou<br>by the blessings of Devaraja (Indra) attain the highest region in the<br>celestial mansion and attaining fame shalt thou certainly conquer the<br>heavenly region. And, O lord of men, if Vrihaspati act as thy priest,<br>thou shalt be able to conquer all the regions inhabited by men, and the<br>heavenly regions, and all the highest regions created by Prajapati and<br>even the entire kingdom of the gods."<br><br>Samvarta said, "Thou must never come again thus to present Vrihaspati to<br>Marutta: for know, O Pavaka, (Agni) if thou dost, I losing my temper,<br>will burn thee with my fierce evil eyes."<br><br>Vyasa said, "Then Agni apprehending destruction by fire, and trembling<br>like the leaves of the Aswattha tree (Ficus religiosa), returned to the<br>gods, and the high-souled Sakra seeing that carrier of oblations (Agni)<br>in the company of Vrihaspati said as follows:<br><br>Indra said, "O Jataveda (Agni), didst thou go to present Vrihaspati to<br>Marutta according to my direction? What did that sacrificing king say<br>unto thee and did he accept my message?"<br><br>Agni said, "Thy message was not acceptable by Marutta and when urged by<br>me, he clasping the hands of Vrihaspati, repeatedly said, that Samvarta<br>would act as his priest. And he also observed that he did not desire to<br>attain the worldly and the heavenly regions and all the highest regions<br>of Prajapati, and that if he were so minded, he would accept the terms of<br>Indra."<br><br>Indra said, "Do thou go back to that king and meeting him, tell him these<br>words of mine, full of significance, and if he obey them not, I shall<br>strike him with my thunderbolt."<br><br>Agni said, "Let this king of the Gandharvas repair thither as thy<br>messenger, O Vasava, for, I am afraid to go thither myself. Know, O<br>Sakra, that highly incensed Samvarta, used to ascetic practices, told me<br>these words in a rage. 'I shall burn thee with my fierce evil eyes if<br>thou on any account come again here to present Vrihaspati to king<br>Marutta.'"<br><br>Sakra said, "O Jataveda, it is thou who dost burn all other things and<br>there is none else who can reduce thee to ashes. All the world is afraid<br>to come in contact with thee. O carrier of oblations, these words of<br>thine are worthy of no credence."<br><br>Agni said, "Thou, O Sakra, hast encompassed the dominion of the heaven<br>and the earth and the firmament by the might of thy own arms, but even<br>thus how could Vritra (of old) wrest from thee the sovereignty of the<br>celestial regions?"<br><br>Indra said, "I can reduce my foes to submission and can even reduce the<br>size of a mountain to an atom, if I will it. But, O Vahnni, as I do not<br>accept the libation of Soma if offered by a foe, and as I do not strike<br>the weak with my thunderbolt, Vritra seemed to triumph over me for a<br>time. But who among mortals can live in peace by creating feud with me. I<br>have banished the Kalakeyas to the earth, and removed the Danavas from<br>heaven, and have terminated the existence of Prahlada in heaven. Can<br>there be any man who can live in peace by provoking my enmity?"<br><br>Agni said, "Dost thou, O Mahendra, remember that in olden times when the<br>sage Chyavana officiated at the sacrifice of Saryati with the twin gods<br>Aswins and himself appropriated the Soma offering alone, thou wert filled<br>with wrath, and when bent upon preventing Saryati's sacrifice, thou didst<br>violently strike Chyavana with thy thunderbolt? But that Brahmana, O<br>Purandara, giving way to passion, was able by the power of his devotions<br>to seize and hold fast by hand with thy thunder-bolt in it. And in a<br>rage, he again created a terrible looking enemy of thine, the Asura named<br>Mada assuming all shapes, on beholding whom thou didst shut thine eyes<br>with fear, whose one huge jaw was placed on earth, and the other extended<br>to the celestial regions, and who looked terrible with his thousand sharp<br>teeth extending over a hundred Yojanas, and had four prominent ones<br>thick-set, and shining like a pillar of silver, and extending over two<br>hundred Yojanas. And when grinding his teeth he pursued thee with his<br>terrible and uplifted pike with the object of killing thee. Thou on<br>beholding that terrible monster, presented a (pitiful) spectacle to all<br>the by-standers. Then, O slayer of Danavas, overcome with fear of the<br>monster, with thy hands clasped in supplication, thou didst seek the<br>protection of the great sage. The might of Brahmanas, O Sakra, is greater<br>than that of the Kshatriyas. None are more powerful than Brahmanas and<br>knowing duly, as I do, the power of Brahmanas, I do not, O Sakra, desire<br>to come in conflict with Samvarta."
