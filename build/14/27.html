                            "The Brahmana said, 'Having crossed that impassable fastness (the world)<br>which has purposes for its gadflies and mosquitoes, grief and joy for its<br>cold and heat, heedlessness for its blinding darkness, cupidity and<br>diseases for its reptiles, wealth for its one danger on the road, and<br>lust and wrath its robbers, I have entered the extensive forest of<br>(Brahman)'.<br><br>"The wife of the Brahmana said, 'Where is that foremost, O thou of great<br>wisdom? What are its trees? What its rivers? What its mountains and<br>hills? How far is that forest?'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'There exists nothing that is separate from it. There<br>is nothing more delightful than it. There is nothing that is unseparated<br>from it. There is nothing more afflicting than it. There is nothing<br>smaller than that. There is nothing vaster than that. There is nothing<br>minuter than that. There is no happiness that can resemble it. Regenerate<br>persons, entering into it, at once transcend both joy and sorrow. They<br>(then) never stand in fear of any creature, nor does any creature stand<br>in fear of them. In that forest are seven large trees, seven fruits, and<br>seven guests. There are seven hermitages, seven (forms of) Yoga<br>concentration, and seven (forms) of initiation. Even this a description<br>of that forest.[76] The trees which stand filling that forest, produce<br>excellent flowers and fruits of five colours. The trees which stand there<br>filling that forest, produce flowers and fruits that are of excellent<br>colours and that are, besides, of two kinds. The trees which stand there<br>filling that forest, produce flowers and fruits that are endued with<br>fragrance and that are, besides, of two colours. The trees which stand<br>there filling that forest, produce flowers and fruits that are possessed<br>of fragrance and that are, besides, of one colour. The two trees which<br>stand filling that forest, produce many flowers and fruits that are of<br>unmanifest colours. There is one fire here, possessed of a good mind.<br>That is connected with Brahmana. The five senses are the fuel here. The<br>seven forms of Emancipation flowing from them are the seven forms of<br>Initiation. The qualities are the fruits, and the guests eat those<br>fruits. There, in diverse places, the great Rishis accept hospitality.<br>When they, having been worshipped, become annihilated, then another<br>forest shines forth. In that forest, Intelligence is the tree;<br>Emancipation is the fruit; Tranquillity is the shade of which it is<br>possessed. It has knowledge for its resting house, contentment for its<br>water, and the Kshetrajna for its sun. Its end cannot be ascertained<br>upwards, downwards, or horizontally. Seven females always dwell there,<br>with faces downwards, possessed of effulgence, and endued with the cause<br>of generations. They take up all the different tastes from all creatures,<br>even as inconstancy sucks up truth. In that itself dwell, and from that<br>emerge, the seven Rishis who are crowned with ascetic success, with those<br>seven having Vasishtha for their foremost. Glory, effulgence, greatness,<br>enlightenment, victory, perfection, and energy, these seven always follow<br>this same like rays following the sun. Hills and mountains also exist<br>there, collected together; and rivers and streams bearing waters in their<br>course, waters that are born of Brahma. And there happens a confluence<br>also of streams in the secluded spot for sacrifice. Thence those that are<br>contented with their own souls proceed to the Grandsire. Those whose<br>wishes have been reduced, whose wishes have been directed to excellent<br>vows, and whose sins have been burnt off by penances, merging themselves<br>in their souls, succeed in attaining to Brahman. Tranquillity is praised<br>by those who are conversant with the forest of knowledge. Keeping that<br>forest in view, they take birth so as not to lose courage. Even such is<br>that sacred forest that is understood by Brahmanas, and understanding it,<br>they live (in accordance with the ordinance), directed by the<br>Kshetrajna.'"
