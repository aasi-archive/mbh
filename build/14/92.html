                            "Janamejaya said, 'If, O illustrious one, Heaven is the fruit of wealth<br>acquired by lawful means, do thou discourse to me fully on it. Thou art<br>well-conversant with the subject and therefore, it behoveth thee to<br>explain it. O regenerate one, thou hast said unto me what the high fruit<br>was that accrued unto that Brahmana, who lived according to the Unccha<br>mode, through his gift of powdered barley. Without doubt, all thou hast<br>said is true. In what way, however, was the attainment held certain of<br>the highest end in all sacrifices? O foremost of regenerate persons, it<br>behoveth thee to expound this to me in all its details.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'In this connection is cited this old narrative, O<br>chastiser of foes, of what occurred in former days in the great sacrifice<br>of Agastya. In olden days, O king, Agastya of great energy, devoted to<br>the good of all creatures, entered into a Diksha extending for twelve<br>years.[219] In that sacrifice of the high-souled Rishi many Hotris were<br>engaged that resembled blazing fires in the splendour of their bodies.<br>Among them were men that subsisted upon roots or fruits, or that used two<br>pieces of stone only for husking their corn, or that were supported by<br>only the rays (of the moon). Among them were also men who never took any<br>food unless it was placed before them by others solicitous of feeding<br>them, and those who never ate anything without having first served the<br>deities, the Pitris, and guests, and those who never washed the food<br>which they took. There were also Yatis and Bikshus among them, O king.<br>All of them were men who had obtained a sight of the deity of<br>Righteousness in his embodied form. They had subjugated wrath and<br>acquired a complete mastery over all their senses. Living in the<br>observance of self-restraint, they were freed from pride and the desire<br>of injuring others. They were always observant of a pure conduct and were<br>never obstructed (in the prosecution of their purposes) by their senses.<br>Those great Rishis attended that sacrifice and accomplished its various<br>rites. The illustrious Rishi (Agastya) acquired the food that was<br>collected in that sacrifice and that came up to the required measure, by<br>lawful means according to the best of his power. Numerous other ascetics<br>at that time performed large sacrifices. As Agastya, however, was engaged<br>in that sacrifice of his, the thousand-eyed Indra, O best of the<br>Bharatas, ceased to pour rain (on the Earth). At the intervals, O king,<br>of the sacrificial rites, this talk occurred among those Rishis of<br>cleansed souls about the high-souled Agastya, viz., 'This Agastya,<br>engaged in sacrifice, is making gifts of food with heart purged of pride<br>and vanity. The deity of the clouds, however, has ceased to pour rain.<br>How, indeed, will food grow? This sacrifice of the Rishi, ye Brahmanas,<br>is great and extends for twelve years. The deity will not pour rain for<br>these twelve years. Reflecting on this, it behoveth you to do some favour<br>unto this Rishi of great intelligence, viz., Agastya of severe penances.'<br>When these words were said, Agastya of great prowess, gratifying those<br>ascetics by bending his head, said, 'If Vasava does not pour rain for<br>those twelve years, I shall then perform the mental sacrifice. Even this<br>is the eternal ordinance. If Vasava does not pour rain for these twelve<br>years, I shall then perform the Touch-sacrifice. Even this is the eternal<br>sacrifice. If Vasava does not pour rain for these twelve years, I shall<br>then, putting forth all my exertion, make arrangements for other<br>sacrifices characterised by the observance of the most difficult and<br>severe vows. This present sacrifice of mine, with seeds, has been<br>arranged for by me with labour extending for many years.[220] I shall,<br>with seeds, accomplish much good. No impediment will arise. This my<br>sacrifice is incapable of being baffled. It matters little whether the<br>deity pours rains or no downpours happen. Indeed, if Indra does not, of<br>his own will, show any regard for me, I shall, in that case, transform<br>myself into Indra and keep all creatures alive. Every creature, on<br>whatever food he has been nourished, will continue to be nourished on it<br>as before. I can even repeatedly create a different order of things. Let<br>gold and whatever else of wealth there is, come to this place today. Let<br>all the wealth that occurs in the three worlds come here today of its own<br>accord. Let all the tribes of celestial Apsaras, all the Gandharvas along<br>with the Kinnaras, and Viswavasu, and others there are (of that order),<br>approach this sacrifice of mine. Let all the wealth that exists among the<br>Northern Kurus, come of their own accord to these sacrifices. Let Heaven,<br>and all those who have Heaven for their home, and Dharma himself, come<br>hither.'&#8212;After the ascetic had uttered these words, everything happened<br>as he wished, in consequence of his penances, for Agastya was endued with<br>a mind that resembled a blazing fire and was possessed of extraordinary<br>energy. The Rishis who were there beheld the power of penances with<br>rejoicing hearts. Filled with wonder they then said these words of grave<br>import.'<br><br>"The Rishis said, 'We have been highly gratified with the words thou hast<br>uttered. We do not, however, wish that thy penances should suffer any<br>diminution. Those sacrifices are approved by us which are performed by<br>lawful means. Indeed, we desire duly those sacrifices which rest on<br>lawful means.[221] Earning our food by lawful means and observant of our<br>respective duties, we shall seek to go through sacrificial initiations<br>and the pouring of libations on the sacred fire and the other religious<br>rites. We should adore the deities, practising Brahmacharyya by lawful<br>means. Completing the period of Brahmacharyya we have come out of our<br>abode, observing lawful methods. That understanding, which is freed from<br>the desire of inflicting any kind of injury on others, is approved by us.<br>Thou shouldst always, O puissant one, command such abstention from injury<br>in all sacrifices. We shall then be highly gratified, O foremast of<br>regenerate ones. After the completion of thy sacrifice, when dismissed by<br>thee, we shall then, leaving this place, go away.' As they were saying<br>these words, Purandara, the chief of the deities, endued with great<br>energy, beholding the power of Agastya's penances, poured rain. Indeed, O<br>Janamejaya, till the completion of the sacrifice of that Rishi of<br>immeasurable prowess, the deity of rain poured rain that met the wishes<br>of men in respect of both quantity and time. Placing Vrihaspati before<br>him, the chief of the deities came there, O royal sage, and gratified the<br>Rishi Agastya. On the completion of that sacrifice, Agastya, filled with<br>joy, worshipped those great Rishis duly and then dismissed them all.'<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'Who was that mongoose with a golden head, that said<br>all those words in a human voice? Asked by me, do thou tell me this.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Thou didst not ask me before and, therefore, I did<br>not tell thee. Hear as I tell thee who that mongoose was and why he could<br>assume a human voice. In former times, the Rishi Jamadagni proposed to<br>perform a Sraddha. His Homa cow came to him and the Rishi milked her<br>himself. He then placed the milk in a vessel that was new, durable and<br>pure. The deity Dharma, assuming the form of Anger, entered that vessel<br>of milk. Indeed, Dharma was desirous of ascertaining what that foremost<br>of Rishis would do when seeing some injury done to him. Having reflected<br>thus, Dharma spoiled that milk. Knowing that the spoiler of his milk was<br>Anger, the ascetic was not at all enraged with him. Anger, then, assuming<br>the form of a Brahmana lady, showed himself to the Rishi. Indeed, Anger,<br>finding that he had been conquered by that foremost one of Bhrigu's race,<br>addressed him, saying, 'O chief of Bhrigu's race, I have been conquered<br>by thee. There is a saying among men that the Bhrigus are very wrathful.<br>I now find that that saying is false, since I have been subdued by thee.<br>Thou art possessed of a mighty soul. Thou art endued with forgiveness. I<br>stand here today, owning thy sway. I fear thy penances, O righteous one.<br>Do thou, O puissant Rishi, show me favour.'<br><br>"Jamadagni said, 'I have seen thee, O Anger, in thy embodied form. Go<br>thou whithersoever thou likest, without any anxiety. Thou hast not done<br>me any injury today. I have no grudge against thee. Those for whom I had<br>kept this milk are the highly blessed Pitris. Present thyself before them<br>and ascertain their intentions.' Thus addressed, penetrated with fear,<br>Anger vanished from the sight of the Rishi. Through the curse of the<br>Pitris he became a mongoose. He then began to gratify the Pitris in order<br>to bring about an end of his curse. By them he was told these words, 'By<br>speaking disrespectfully of Dharma thou shalt attain to the end of thy<br>curse.' Thus addressed by them he wandered over places where sacrifices<br>were performed and over other sacred places, employed in censuring great<br>sacrifices. It was he that came to the great sacrifice of king<br>Yudhishthira. Dispraising the son of Dharma by a reference to the prastha<br>of powdered barley, Anger became freed from his curse, for Yudhishthira<br>(as Dharma's son) was Dharma's self. Even this is what occurred in the<br>sacrifice of that high-souled king. Mongoose disappeared there in our<br>very sight.'"[222]<br><br>The end of Aswamedha Parva
