                            "The Brahmana said, 'In this connection is cited the ancient story of the<br>discourse between Narada and the Rishi Devamata.'<br><br>"Devamata said, 'What verily, comes first into existence, of a creature<br>that takes birth? Is it Prana, or Apana, or Samana, or Vyana, or Udana?'<br><br>"Narada said, 'By whatever the creature is created, that first comes unto<br>him which is other (or separate from him). The life winds are to be known<br>as existing in pairs, viz., those that move transversely, upwards, and<br>downwards.'<br><br>"Devamata said, 'By whom (among the life-winds) is a creature produced?<br>Who (amongst) them comes first? Do thou tell me what the pairs are of the<br>life-winds, that move transversely, upwards, and downwards.'<br><br>"Narada said, 'From Sankalpa (wish) arises Pleasure. It also arises from<br>sound. It arises also from taste; it arises too from colour. From the<br>semen, united with blood, first flows Prana. Upon the semen being<br>modified by Prana, flows Apana. Pleasure arises from the semen as well.<br>It arises from taste also. This is the form (effect) of Udana. Pleasure<br>is produced from union. Semen is generated by desire. From desire is<br>produced the menstrual flow. In the union of semen and blood, generated<br>by Samana and Vyana, the pair that consists of Prana and Apana, enters,<br>moving transversely and upwards, Vyana and Samana both form a pair that<br>moves transversely. Agni (fire) is all the deities. Even this is the<br>teaching of the Veda. The knowledge of Agni arises in a Brahmana with<br>intelligence. The smoke of that fire is of the form of (the attribute<br>called) Darkness. The attribute that is known by the name of Passion is<br>in its ashes. The quality of goodness arises from that portion of the<br>fire into which the oblation is poured.[66] They that are conversant with<br>sacrifices know that Samana and Vyana are from the attribute of Goodness.<br>Prana and Apana are portions of the oblation (of clarified butter).<br>Between them is the Fire. That is the excellent form (or seat) of Udana,<br>as the Brahmanas know. Listen as I say which is distinct from the pairs.<br>Day and Night constitute a pair. Between them is the Fire. That is the<br>excellent seat of Udana as the Brahmanas know. The existent and the<br>non-existent form a pair. Between them is the Fire. That is the excellent<br>seat of Udana as the Brahmanas know. First is Samana; then Vyana. The<br>latter's function is managed through it (viz., Samana). Then, secondly,<br>Samana once more comes into operation. Only Vyana exists for<br>tranquillity. Tranquillity is eternal Brahman. This is the excellent seat<br>of Udana as the Brahmanas know.'"[67]
