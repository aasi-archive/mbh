                            "Vaisampayana said, 'The ruler of Manipura, Vabhruvahana, hearing that<br>his sire Arjuna had arrived within his dominions, went out with humility,<br>with a number of Brahmanas and some treasure in his van.[194]<br>Remembering, however, the duties of Kshatriyas, Dhananjaya of great<br>intelligence, seeing the ruler of Manipura arrive in that guise, did not<br>approve of it. The righteous-souled Phalguna angrily said, 'This conduct<br>of thine is not becoming. Thou hast certainly fallen away from Kshatriya<br>duties. I have come here as the protector of Yudhishthira's sacrificial<br>horse. Why, O son, wilt thou not fight me, seeing that I have come within<br>thy dominions? Fie on thee, O thou of foolish understanding, fie on thee<br>that hast fallen away from Kshatriya duties! Fie on thee that would<br>receive me peacefully, even though I have come here for battling with<br>thee. In thus receiving me peacefully thou actest like a woman. O thou of<br>wretched understanding, if I had come to thee, leaving aside my arms,<br>then would this behaviour of thine have been fit, O worst of men.'<br>Learning that these words were addressed by her husband, the daughter of<br>the Snake-king, viz., Ulupi unable to tolerate it, pierced through the<br>Earth and came up to that spot.[195] She beheld her son standing there<br>perfectly cheerless and with face hanging down. Indeed, the prince was<br>repeatedly rebuked by his sire who was desirous of battle with him, O<br>monarch. The daughter of the snake, with every limb possessed of beauty,<br>viz., Ulupi, said these words consistent with righteousness and duty unto<br>the prince who was conversant with righteousness and duty,&#8212;'Know that I<br>am thy mother Ulupi that am the daughter of a snake. Do thou accomplish<br>my behest, O son, for thou wouldst then attain to great merit. Fight thy<br>father, this foremost one of Kuru's race, this hero that is irresistible<br>in battle. Without doubt, he will then be gratified with thee.' In this<br>way was king Vabhruvahana incited against his sire by his (step) mother.<br>At last, endued as he was with great energy, he made up his mind, O chief<br>of the Bharata's, to fight Dhananjaya. Putting on his armour of bright<br>gold and his effulgent head-gear, he ascended an excellent car which had<br>hundreds of quivers ready on it. That car was equipt with necessaries for<br>battle and had steeds yoked to it that were endued with the speed of the<br>mind. It had excellent wheels and a strong Upashkara, and was adorned<br>with golden ornaments of every kind. Raising his standard which was<br>decorated most beautifully and which bore the device of a lion in gold,<br>the handsome prince Vabhruvahana proceeded against his sire for battle.<br>Coining upon the sacrificial steed which was protected by Partha, the<br>heroic prince caused it to be seized by persons well-versed in<br>horse-lore. Beholding the steed seized, Dhananjaya became filled with<br>joy. Standing on the Earth, that hero began to resist the advance of his<br>son who was on his car. The king afflicted the hero with repeated showers<br>of shafts endued with whetted points and resembling snakes of virulent<br>poison. The battle that took, place between sire and son was<br>incomparable. It resembled the encounter between the deities and the<br>Asuras of old. Each was gratified with obtaining the other for an<br>antagonist. Then Vabhruvahana, laughing, pierced the diadem-decked<br>Arjuna, that foremost of men, in the shoulder with a straight shaft.<br>Equipt with feathers, that shaft penetrated Arjuna's body like a snake<br>penetrating on an anthill. Piercing the son of Kunti through, the shaft<br>went deep into the Earth. Feeling acute pain, the intelligent Dhananjaya<br>rested awhile, supporting himself on his excellent bow. He stood, having<br>recourse to his celestial energy and seemed to outward appearance like<br>one deprived of life. That foremost of men, then regaining consciousness,<br>praised his son highly. Possessed of great splendour, the son of Sakra<br>said, 'Excellent, Excellent, O mighty-armed one, O son of Chitrangada! O<br>son, beholding this feat, so worthy of thee, I am highly gratified with<br>thee. I shall now shoot these arrows at thee, O son. Stand for fight<br>(without running away).' Having said these words, that slayer of foes<br>shot a shower of arrows on the prince. King Vabhruvahana, however, with<br>his own broad-headed shafts, cut all those arrows which were shot from<br>Gandiva and which resembled the thunder-bolt of Indra in splendour, some<br>in twain and some into three parts. Then the standard, decked with gold<br>and resembling a golden palmyra, on the king's car was cut off by Partha<br>with some excellent shafts of his. The son of Pandu, laughing, next slew<br>the king's steeds endued with large size and great speed. Descending from<br>his car, the king inflamed with rage, fought his sire on foot. Gratified<br>with the prowess of his son, that foremost one of the sons of Pritha,<br>viz., the son of the wielder of the thunder-bolt, began to afflict him<br>greatly. The mighty Vabhruvahana, thinking that his father was no longer<br>able to face him, again afflicted him with many shafts resembling snakes<br>of virulent poison. From a spirit of boyishness he then vigorously<br>pierced his father in the breast with a whetted shaft equipt with<br>excellent wings. That shaft, O king, penetrated the body of Pandu's son<br>and reaching his very vital caused him great pain. The delighter of the<br>Kurus, Dhananjaya, deeply pierced therewith by his son, then fell down in<br>a swoon on the Earth, O king. When that hero, that bearer of the burthens<br>of the Kuru's fell down, the son of Chitrangada also became deprived of<br>his senses. The latter's swoon was due to his exertions in battle as also<br>to his grief at seeing his sire slain. He had been pierced deeply by<br>Arjuna with clouds of arrows. He, therefore, fell down at the van of<br>battle embracing the Earth. Rearing that her husband had been slain and<br>that her son had fallen down on the Earth, Chitrangada, in great<br>agitation of mind, repaired to the field of battle. Her heart burning<br>with sorrow, weeping piteously the while, and trembling all over, the<br>mother of the ruler of Manipura saw her slain husband."'
