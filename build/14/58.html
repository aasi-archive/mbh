                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Utanka, coming back to king Saudasa who was always<br>well-disposed towards all his friends, solicited him for some sign (to<br>convince Madayanti of the fact of his being really commissioned by the<br>king). That foremost one of Ikshwaku's race then gave him a sign.'<br><br>"Saudasa said, 'This my present condition is intolerable. I do not behold<br>any refuge. Knowing this to be my wish, do thou give away the jewelled<br>ear-rings.'[172] Thus addressed by the king, Utanka went back to the<br>queen and reported to her the words of her lord. Hearing those words, the<br>queen gave unto Utanka her jewelled ear-rings. Having obtained the<br>ear-rings, Utanka came back to the king and said unto him, 'I desire to<br>hear, O monarch, what the import is of those mysterious words Which thou<br>saidst as a sign to thy queen.'<br><br>"Saudasa said, 'Kshatriyas are seen to honour the Brahmanas from the very<br>beginning of the creation. Towards the Brahmanas, however, many offences<br>arise (on the part of Kshatriyas). As regards myself, I am always bent in<br>humility before them. I am overtaken by a calamity through a Brahmana.<br>Possessed of Madayanti, I do not see any other refuge. Indeed, O foremost<br>of all persons having of a high goal, I do not behold any other refuge<br>for myself in the matter of approaching the gates of Heaven, or in<br>continuing here, O best of regenerate ones. It is impossible for a king<br>that is hostile to Brahmanas to continue living in this world or in<br>attaining to happiness in the next. Hence have I given thee these my<br>jewelled ear-rings which were coveted by thee.[173] Do thou now keep the<br>compact which thou hast made with me today.'<br><br>"Utanka said, 'O king, I shall certainly act according to my promise. I<br>shall truly come back and place myself under thy power. There is,<br>however, a question, O scorcher of foes, which I wish to ask thee.'<br><br>"Saudasa said, 'Say, O learned Brahmana, what is in thy mind. I shall<br>certainly reply unto thy words. I shall dispel whatever doubt may be in<br>thy mind. I have no hesitation in this.'<br><br>"Utanka said, 'Those who are skilled in the rules of duty say that<br>Brahmanas are of restrained speech. One who behaves wrongly towards<br>friends is regarded as vile as a thief.'[174] Thou, again, O king, hast<br>become my friend today. Do thou then, O foremost of men, give me such<br>counsel as is approved by the wise. As regards myself, I have now<br>obtained the fruition of my wishes. Thou, again, art a cannibal. Is it<br>proper for me to come back to thee or not?'<br><br>"Saudasa said, 'If it is proper (for me), O foremost of superior<br>Brahmanas, to say what thou askest, I should then, O best of regenerate<br>ones, tell thee that thou shouldst never come back to me. O perpetuator<br>of Bhrigu's race, by acting even thus, thou wilt attain to what is<br>beneficial to thee. If thou comest back, O learned Brahmana, thou wilt<br>surely meet with death.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by the intelligent king in<br>respect of what was beneficial for him. Utanka took leave of the monarch<br>and set out for the presence of Ahalya. Desirous of doing what was<br>agreeable to the wife of his preceptor, he took the ear-rings with him<br>and set out with great speed for reaching the retreat of Gautama.<br>Protecting them even in the manner directed by Madayanti, that is,<br>binding them within the folds of his black deer-skin, he proceeded on his<br>way. After he had proceeded for some distance, he became afflicted by<br>hunger. He there beheld a Vilwa tree bent down with the weight of (ripe)<br>fruits.[175] He climbed that tree. Causing his deer-skin, O chastiser of<br>foes, to hang on a branch, that foremost of regenerate persons then began<br>to pluck some fruits. While he was employed in plucking those fruits with<br>eyes directed towards them, some of them fell, O king, on that deerskin<br>in which those ear-rings had been carefully tied by that foremost of<br>Brahmanas. With the strokes of the fruits, the knot became untied.<br>Suddenly that deer-skin, with the ear-rings in it, fell down. When the<br>knot being unfastened, the deer-skin fell down on the ground, a snake who<br>was there beheld those jewelled ear-rings. That snake belonged to the<br>race of Airavata. With great promptness he took up the ear-rings in his<br>mouth and then entered an anthill. Beholding the ear-rings taken away by<br>that snake, Utanka, filled with wrath and in great anxiety of mind, came<br>down from the tree. Taking his staff he began to pierce that anthill.<br>That best of Brahmanas, burning with wrath and the desire for revenge,<br>ceaselessly employed himself for five and thirty days in that task. The<br>goddess Earth, unable to bear the force of Utanka's walking staff and<br>with body torn therewith, became exceedingly anxious. Unto that<br>regenerate Rishi then, who continued to dig the Earth from desire of<br>making a path to the nether regions inhabited by the Nagas, the chief of<br>the celestials, armed with the thunder, came there, on his car drawn by<br>green horses. Endued with great energy, he beheld that foremost of<br>Brahmanas, as he sat there engaged in his task.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Assuming the garb of a Brahmana afflicted with<br>the sorrow of Utanka, the chief of the celestials addressed him, saying,<br>'This (purpose of thine) is incapable of being achieved. The regions of<br>the Nagas are thousands of Yojanas removed from this place. I think that<br>thy purpose is not capable of being achieved with thy walking staff.'<br><br>"Utanka said, 'If, O Brahmana, the ear-rings be not recovered by me from<br>the regions of the Nagas, I shall cast off my life-breaths before thy<br>eyes, O foremost of regenerate persons!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'When the thunder-armed Indra failed to divert Utanka<br>from his purpose, he united the latter's walking staff with the force of<br>thunder. Then, O Janamejaya, the Earth, opening with those strokes having<br>the force of thunder, yielded a way to the (nether) regions inhabited by<br>the Nagas. By that path Utanka entered the world of Nagas. He saw that<br>that region lay extended thousands of Yojanas on all sides. Indeed, O<br>blessed one, it was equipt with many walls made of pure gold and decked<br>with jewels and gems. There were many fine tanks of water furnished with<br>flights of stair-cases made of pure crystal, and many rivers of clear and<br>transparent water. He saw also many trees with diverse species of birds<br>perching on them. That perpetuator of Bhrigu's race behold the gate of<br>that region which was full five Yojanas high and a hundred Yojanas in<br>width. Beholding the region of the Nagas, Utanka became very cheerless.<br>Indeed, he, despaired of getting back the earrings. Then there appeared<br>unto him a black steed with a white tail. His face and eyes were of a<br>coppery hue, O thou of Kuru's race, and he seemed to blaze forth with<br>energy. Addressing Utanka, he said, 'Do thou blow into the Apana duct of<br>my body. Thou wilt then, O learned Brahmana, get back thy ear-rings which<br>have been taken away by a descendant of Airavata's race! Do not loathe to<br>do my bidding, O son. Thou didst it often at the retreat of Gautama in<br>former days.'<br><br>"Utanka said, 'How did I know thee in the retreat of my preceptor?<br>Indeed, I wish to hear how I did in those days what thou biddest me do<br>now.'<br><br>"The steed said, 'Know, O learned Brahmana, that I am the preceptor of<br>thy preceptor, for I am the blazing Jatavedas (deity of fire). By thee I<br>was often worshipped for the sake of thy preceptor, O child of Bhrigu's<br>race, duly and with a pure heart and body. For that reason I shall<br>accomplish what is for thy good. Do my bidding without delay.' Thus<br>addressed by the deity of fire, Utanka did as he was directed. The deity<br>then, gratified with him, blazed up for consuming everything. From the<br>pores of his body, O Bharata, in consequence of his very nature, a thick<br>smoke issued threatening terrors to the world of Nagas. With that mighty<br>and wide-spreading smoke, O Bharata, everything became enveloped in<br>gloom, so that nothing, O king, could any longer be seen in the world of<br>the Nagas. Cries of woe were heard throughout the mansions of the<br>Airavatas, uttered by the Nagas headed by Vasuki, O Janamejaya. Enveloped<br>by that smoke, the palaces could no longer be seen, O Bharata. These<br>resembled woods and hill overwhelmed by a thick forest. With eyes that<br>were red in consequence of that smoke, and afflicted by the energy of the<br>deity of fire, the Nagas came out of their mansions to the high-souled<br>son of Bhrigu's race for ascertaining what was the matter. Having heard<br>what the matter was from that ascetic of immeasurable energy, all the<br>Nagas, with fear depicted on their eyes, offered him their worship<br>according to due forms. Indeed, all the Nagas placing the old and the<br>young one's before them, bowed unto him with their heads and joining<br>their hands addressed him, saying, 'Be gratified with us, O holy one!'<br>Having gratified that Brahmana and offered him water to wash his feet and<br>the ingredients of the Arghya (for honouring him), the Nagas gave him<br>those celestial and highly-adored ear-rings. Thus honoured by them,<br>Utanka of great prowess, circumambulating the deity of fire, started for<br>the retreat of his preceptor. Indeed, repairing quickly to Gautama's<br>asylum, O king, he presented those ear-rings unto the wife of his<br>preceptor, O sinless one. That best of Brahmanas also told his preceptor<br>everything about Vasuki and the other Nagas that had occurred. It was<br>even thus, O Janamejaya, that the high-souled Utanka, having wandered<br>through the three worlds, fetched those jewelled ear-rings (for his<br>preceptor's wife). Of such prowess, O chief of Bharata's race, was the<br>ascetic Utanka. So austere were the penances with which he was endued. I<br>have thus told thee what thou hadst asked me.'"
