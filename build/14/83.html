                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Worshipped by the ruler of Magadha, Pandu's son<br>having white steeds yoked unto his car, proceeded along the south,<br>following the (sacrificial) steed. Turning round in course of his<br>wanderings at will, the mighty steed came upon the beautiful city of the<br>Chedis called after the oyster.[199] Sarabha, the son of Sisupala, endued<br>with great strength, first encountered Arjuna in battle and then<br>worshipped him with due honours. Worshipped by him, O king, that best of<br>steeds then proceeded to the realms of the Kasis, the Angas, the Kosalas,<br>the Kiratas, and the Tanganas. Receiving due honours in all those realms,<br>Dhananjaya turned his course. Indeed, the son of Kunti then proceeded to<br>the country of the Dasarnas. The ruler of that people was Chitrangada who<br>was endued with great strength and was a crusher of foes. Between him and<br>Vijaya occurred a battle exceedingly terrible. Bringing him under his<br>sway the diadem-decked Arjuna, that foremost of men, proceeded to the<br>dominions of the Nishada king, viz., the son of Ekalavya. The soon of<br>Ekalavya received Arjuna in battle. The encounter that took place between<br>the Kuru hero and the Nishadas was so furious as to make the hair stand<br>on end. Unvanquished in battle, the valiant son of Kunti defeated the<br>Nishada king who proved an obstacle to the sacrifice. Having subjugated<br>the son of Ekalavya, O king, the son of Indra, duly worshipped by the<br>Nishadas, then proceeded towards the southern ocean. In those regions<br>battle took place between the diadem-decked hero and the Dravidas and<br>Andhras and the fierce Mahishakas and the hillmen of Kolwa. Subjugating<br>those tribes without having to accomplish any fierce feats, Arjuna<br>proceeded to the country of the Surashtras, his footsteps guided by the<br>horse. Arrived at Gokarna, he repaired thence to Prabhasa. Next he<br>proceeded to the beautiful city of Dwaravati protected by the heroes of<br>the Vrishni race. When the beautiful sacrificial horse of the Kuru king<br>reached Dwaravati, the Yadava youths, used force against that foremost of<br>steeds. King Ugrasena, however, soon went out and forbade those youths<br>from doing what they meditated. Then the ruler of the Vrishnis and the<br>Andhakas, issuing out of his palace, with Vasudeva, the maternal uncle of<br>Arjuna, in his company, cheerfully met the Kuru hero and received him<br>with due rites. The two elderly chiefs honoured Arjuna duly. Obtaining<br>their permission, the Kuru prince then proceeded to where the horse he<br>followed, led him. The sacrificial steed then proceeded along the coast<br>of the western ocean and at last reached the country of the five waters<br>which swelled with population and prosperity. Thence, O king, the steed<br>proceeded to the country of Gandharas. Arrived there, it wandered at<br>will, followed by the son of Kunti. Then occurred a fierce battle between<br>the diadem-decked hero and the ruler of Gandharas, viz., the son of<br>Sakuni, who had a bitter rememberance of the grudge his sire bore to the<br>Pandavas.'
