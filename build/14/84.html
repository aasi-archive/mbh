                            "Vaisampayana said, 'The heroic son of Sakuni, who was a mighty<br>car-warrior among the Gandharas, accompanied by a large force, proceeded<br>against the Kuru hero of curly hair.[200] That force was properly equipt<br>with elephants and horses and cars, and was adorned with many flags and<br>banners. Unable to bear and, therefore, burning to avenge, the slaughter<br>of their king Sakuni, those warriors, armed with bows, rushed together at<br>Partha. The unvanquished Vibhatsu of righteous soul addressed them<br>peacefully, but they were unwilling to accept the beneficial words of<br>Yudhishthira (through Arjuna). Though forbidden by Partha with sweet<br>words, they still gave themselves up to wrath and surrounded the<br>sacrificial steed. At this, the son of Pandu became filled with wrath.<br>Then Arjuna, carelessly shooting from Gandiva many shafts with razor-like<br>heads that blazed with splendour, cut off the heads of many Gandhara<br>warriors. While thus slaughtered by Partha, the Gandharas, O king,<br>exceedingly afflicted, set free the horse, moved by fear and desisted<br>from battle. Resisted, however, by those Gandhara combatants who still<br>surrounded him on every side, the son of Pandu, possessed of great<br>energy, felled the heads of many, previously naming those whom he thus<br>despatched. When the Gandhara warriors were thus being slain all around<br>him in battle, the royal son of Sakuni came forward to resist the son of<br>Pandu. Unto the Gandhara king who was fighting with him, impelled by<br>Kshatriya duty, Arjuna said, 'I do not intend to slay the kings who fight<br>with me, in consequence of the commands of Yudhishthira. Cease, O hero,<br>to fight with me. Do not court defeat.' Thus addressed the son of Sakuni,<br>stupefied by folly, disregarded that advice and covered with many swift<br>arrows the Kuru hero who resembled Sakra himself in the feats he<br>accomplished in battle. Then Partha, with a crescent-shaped arrow, cut<br>off the head-gear of his foe. Of immeasurable soul, he also caused that<br>head-gear to be borne along a great distance like the head of Jayadratha<br>(after he had cut it off in the battle of Kurukshetra). Beholding this<br>feat, all the Gandhara warriors became filled with wonder. That Arjuna<br>voluntarily spared their king was well understood by them. The prince of<br>the Gandharas then began to fly away from the field, accompanied by all<br>his warriors who resembled a flock of frightened deer. The Gandharas,<br>through fear, lost their senses and wandered over the field, unable to<br>escape. Arjuna, with his broad-headed shafts, cut off the heads of many.<br>Many there were who lost their arms in consequence of Arjuna's arrows,<br>but so stupefied were they with fear that they were not aware of the loss<br>of that limb. Verity, the Gandhara army was exceedingly afflicted with<br>those large shafts which Partha sped from Gandiva. That army, which then<br>consisted of frightened men and elephants and horses, which lost many<br>warriors and animals, and which had been reduced to a rabble and put to<br>rout, began to wander and wheel about the field repeatedly. Among those<br>foes who were thus being slaughtered none could be seen standing in front<br>of the Kuru hero famed for foremost of feats. No one could be seen who<br>was able to bear the prowess of Dhananjaya. Then the mother of the ruler<br>of the Gandharas, filled with fear, and with all the aged ministers of<br>state, came out of her city, bearing an excellent Arghya for Arjuna. She<br>forbade her brave son of steady heart from fighting any longer, and<br>gratified Jishnu who was never fatigued with toil. The puissant Vibhatsu<br>worshipped her and became inclined to show kindness towards the<br>Gandharas. Comforting the son of Sakuni, he said, 'Thou hast not, O<br>mighty-armed hero, done what is agreeable to me by getting thy heart upon<br>these measures of hostility. O slayer of heroes, thou art my brother, O<br>sinless one.[201] Recollecting my mother Gandhari, and for the sake of<br>Dhritarashtra also, I have not taken thy life. It is for this, O king,<br>that thou livest still. Many of thy followers, however, have been slain<br>by me. Let not such a thing happen again. Let hostilities cease. Let not<br>thy understanding again go astray. Thou shouldst go to the<br>Horse-sacrifice of our king which comes off on the day of full moon of<br>the month of Chaitra.'
