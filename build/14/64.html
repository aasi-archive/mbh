They filled the whole Earth with the loud clatter of their<br>wheels. Their praises hymned by eulogists and Sutas and Magadhas and<br>bards, and supported by their own army, they looked like so many Adityas<br>adorned with their own rays. With the white umbrella held over his head,<br>king Yudhishthira shone with beauty like the lord of the stars on the<br>night when he is at full. That foremost of men, the eldest son of Pandu,<br>accepted, with due forms, the blessings and cheers of his gladdened<br>subjects as he proceeded on his way. As regards the soldiers that<br>followed the king, their confused murmurs seemed to fill the entire<br>welkin. That host crossed many lakes and rivers and forests and pleasure<br>gardens. They at last came upon the mountains. Arrived at that region<br>where that wealth was buried, O king, the royal Yudhishthira fixed his<br>camp with all his brothers and troops. The region selected for the<br>purpose, O chief of Bharata's race, was perfectly level and auspicious<br>There the king pitched his camp, placing in his van such Brahmanas as<br>were endued with penances and learning and self-restraint, as also his<br>priest Agnivesya, O thou of Kuru's race, who was well-conversant with the<br>Vedas and all their branches.[180] Then the royal sons of Pandu, and the<br>other kings (who accompanied that expedition), and the Brahmanas and<br>priests well-skilled in sacrificial rites, having duly performed same<br>propitiatory ceremonies, spread themselves all over that spot. Having<br>duly placed the king and his ministers in the middle, the Brahmanas<br>caused the camp to be pitched by laying out six roads and nine<br>divisions.[181] King Yudhishthira caused a separate encampment to be duly<br>made for the infuriate elephants that accompanied his force. When<br>everything was complete, he addressed the Brahmanas, saying, 'Ye foremost<br>of Brahmanas, let that be done which you think should be done in view of<br>the matter at hand. Indeed, let an auspicious day and constellation be<br>fixed for it. Let not a long time pass away over our heads as we wait in<br>suspense here. Ye foremost of learned Brahmanas, having formed this<br>resolution, let that be done which should be done after this.' Hearing<br>these words of the king, the Brahmanas with those amongst them that were<br>well-skilled in the performance of religious rites, became filled with<br>gladness and desirous of doing what was agreeable to king Yudhishthira<br>the just, said these words in reply, 'This very day is, an auspicious one<br>with an auspicious constellation. We shall, therefore, strive to<br>accomplish those high rites we propose. We shall today, O king, live upon<br>water alone. Do you all fast also today' Hearing those words of those<br>foremost Brahmanas, the royal sons of Pandu passed that night, abstaining<br>from all food, and lying confidently on beds of Kusa grass, like blazing<br>fires in a sacrifice. And the night wore away as they listened to the<br>discourses of the learned Brahmanas (on diverse subjects). When the<br>cloudless morning came, those foremost of Brahmanas addressed the royal<br>son of Dharma (saying as follows).'
