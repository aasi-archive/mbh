                            Vaisampayana, said, 'Hearing that the Pandavas were near, that crusher of<br>foes, viz., Vasudeva, accompanied by his ministers, went out for seeing<br>them.<br><br>The Pandavas then, uniting with the Vrishnis according to the usual<br>formalities, together entered, O king, the city named after the elephant.<br>With the hum of voices and the clatter of cars of that mighty host, the<br>Earth and the welkin, and the firmament itself, became as it were<br>entirely filled. The Pandavas, with rejoicing hearts, accompanied by<br>their officers and friends entered the capital, placing that treasure in<br>their van. Repairing, agreeably to custom, to king Dhritarashtra first,<br>they worshipped his feet, announcing their respective names. Those<br>foremost ones of Bharata's race, O chief of kings, then paid their<br>respectful salutations to Gandhari, the daughter of Suvala and to Kunti,<br>They next worshipped (their uncle) Vidura and met Yuyutsu, the son of<br>Dhritarashtra by his Vaisya wife. Those heroes were then worshipped by<br>others and they blazed forth in beauty, O king. After this, O Bharata,<br>those heroes heard the tidings of that highly wonderful and marvellous<br>and glad-some birth of thy father. Hearing of that feat of Vasudeva of<br>great intelligence, they all worshipped Krishna, the delighter of Devaki,<br>who was every way worthy of worship. Then, after a few days, Vyasa, the<br>son of Satyavati, endued with great energy, came to the city named after<br>the elephant. The perpetuators of Kuru's race worshipped the great Rishi<br>according to the usual custom. Indeed, those heroes, with those foremost<br>princes of the Vrishni and the Andhaka races, paid the sage their<br>adorations. After having conversed on various subjects, Dharma's son<br>Yudhishthira addressed Vyasa and said, 'This treasure, O holy one, which<br>has been brought through thy grace I wish to devote to that great<br>sacrifice known by the name of the horse-sacrifice. O best of ascetics, I<br>desire to have thy permission. We are all, O Rishi, at thy disposal, and<br>at that of the high-souled Krishna.'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'I give thee permission, O king. Do what should be done<br>after this. Do thou worship the deities duly by performing the<br>horse-sacrifice with profuse gifts. The horse-sacrifice, O king, is a<br>cleanser of all sins. Without doubt, having worshipped the deities by<br>that sacrifice thou wilt surely be cleansed of all sins.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, the Kuru king Yudhisthira of<br>righteous soul then set his heart, O monarch, on making the necessary<br>preparations for the horse-sacrifice. Having represented all this unto<br>the Island-born Krishna, the king endued with great eloquence approached<br>Vasudeva and said,&#8212;'O foremost of all beings, the goddess Devaki has,<br>through thee, come to be regarded as the most fortunate of mothers! O<br>thou of unfading glory, do thou accomplish that which I shall now tell<br>thee, O mighty-armed one. O delighter of the Kurus, the diverse<br>enjoyments we enjoy have all been acquired through thy puissance. The<br>whole Earth has been subjugated by thee with the aid of thy prowess and<br>intelligence. Do thou, therefore, cause thyself to undergo the rites of<br>initiation. Thou art our highest preceptor and master. If thou performest<br>the sacrifice, O thou of the Dasarha race, I shall be cleansed from every<br>sin. Thou art Sacrifice. Thou art the Indestructible. Thou art this All.<br>Thou art Righteousness. Thou art Prajapati. Thou art the goal of all<br>creatures. Even this is my certain conclusion.'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'O mighty-armed one, it becomes thee to say so, O<br>chastiser of foes. Thou art the goal of all creatures. Even this is my<br>certain conclusion. Amongst the heroes of the Kuru race, in consequence<br>of thy righteousness, thou shinest today in great glory. They have all<br>been cast into the shade, O king, by thee. Thou art our king, and thou<br>art our senior. With my approval freely granted, do thou adore the<br>deities in the sacrifice suggested. Do thou, O Bharata, appoint us to<br>whatever tasks thou likest. Truly, do I pledge myself that I shall<br>accomplish all, O sinless one, that thou mayst bid me accomplish.<br>Bhimasena and Arjuna and the two sons of Madravati will be sacrificing<br>when thou, O king, sacrificest.'"[188]
