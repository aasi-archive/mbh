                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having said these words, Partha set out, following<br>the horse which wandered at its will. The sacrificial steed then turned<br>towards the road that led to the city called after the elephant.<br>Yudhishthira heard from his intelligence-bearers that the steed had<br>turned back. And hearing also that Arjuna was hale and hearty, he became<br>filled with joy.[202] Hearing also the feats, accomplished by Vijaya in<br>the country of the Gandharas as also in another realms, the king became<br>exceedingly glad. Meanwhile, king Yudhishthira the just, seeing that the<br>twelfth day of the lighted fortnight in the month of Magha had come, and<br>noticing also that the constellation was favourable, summoned all his<br>brothers, viz., Bhima and Nakula and Sahadeva. Endued with great energy,<br>the king, O thou of Kuru's race, that foremost of all persons conversant<br>with duties, said these words in proper time. Indeed, that foremost of<br>all speakers, addressing Bhima, the first of all smiters, said;&#8212;'Thy<br>younger brother (Arjuna), O Bhimasena, is coming back with the horse. I<br>have learnt this from those men who had followed Arjuna. The time (for<br>the sacrifice) is come. The sacrificial horse is near. The day of full<br>moon of the month of Magha is at hand. The month is about to expire, O<br>Vrikodara. Let, therefore, learned Brahmanas conversant with the Vedas<br>look for a sacrificial spot for the successful accomplishment of the<br>Horse-sacrifice.' Thus addressed, Bhima obeyed the royal behest. He<br>became very glad upon hearing that Arjuna of curly hair was about to come<br>back. Then Bhima went out with a number of men well conversant with the<br>rules of laying out sacrificial grounds and constructing buildings. And<br>he took with him many Brahmanas well-versed in all the rites of<br>sacrifices. Bhima selected a beautiful spot and caused it to be duly<br>measured out for laying the sacrificial compound. Numerous houses and<br>mansions were constructed on it and high and broad roads also were laid<br>out. Soon enough the Kaurava hero caused that ground to teem with<br>hundreds of excellent mansions. The surface was levelled and made smooth<br>with jewels and gems, and adorned with diverse structures made of gold.<br>Columns were raised, ornamented with bright gold, and high and wide<br>triumphal arches also were constructed on that sacrificial compound. All<br>these were made of pure gold. The righteous-souled prince also caused<br>apartments to be duly constructed for the accommodation of ladies and of<br>the numerous kings who, hailing from many realms, were expected to grace<br>the sacrifice with their presence. The son of Kunti also caused many<br>mansions to be duly erected for Brahmanas who were expected to come from<br>diverse realms. Then the mighty-armed Bhimasena, at the command of the<br>king, sent out messengers to the great kings of the Earth. Those best of<br>kings, came to the Horse-sacrifice of the Kuru monarch for doing what was<br>agreeable to him. And they brought many gems with them and many female<br>slaves and horses and weapons. The sounds that arose from those<br>high-souled kings who resided within those pavilions touched the very<br>heavens and resembled the noise made by the roaring ocean. King<br>Yudhishthira, the delighter of the Kurus, assigned unto the monarchs who<br>thus came to his sacrifice diverse kinds of food and drink, and beds also<br>of celestial beauty. The chief of the Bharatas, viz., king Yudhishthira<br>the just, assigned several stables well filled with different kinds of<br>corn and sugarcane and milk to the animals (that came with the guests).<br>To that great sacrifice of king Yudhishthira the just who was possessed<br>of high intelligence, there also came a large number of Munis all of whom<br>were utterers of Brahman. Indeed, O lord of Earth, all the foremost ones<br>among the regenerate class that were then alive, came to that sacrifice,<br>accompanied by their disciples. The Kuru king received them all. King<br>Yudhishthira of mighty energy, casting off all pride, himself followed<br>all his guests to the pavilions that had been assigned for their<br>residence. Then all the mechanics and engineers, having completed the<br>arrangements of the sacrifice informed king Yudhishthira of it. Hearing<br>that everything was ready, king Yudhishthira the just, full of alertness<br>and attention, became highly glad along with his brothers all of whom<br>honoured him duly.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'When the great sacrifice of Yudhishthira<br>commenced, many eloquent dialecticians started diverse propositions and<br>disputed thereon, desirous of vanquishing one another.[203] The (invited)<br>kings beheld the excellent preparations of that sacrifice, resembling<br>those of the chief himself of the deities, made, O Bharata, by Bhimasena.<br>They beheld many triumphal arches made of gold, and many beds and seats<br>and other articles of enjoyment and luxury, and crowds of men collected<br>at different sports. There were also many jars and vessels and cauldrons<br>and jugs and lids and covers. The invited kings saw nothing there that<br>was not made of gold. Many sacrificial stakes also were set up, made,<br>according to the directions of the scriptures of wood, and adorned with<br>gold. Endued with great effulgence, these were duly planted and dedicated<br>(with scriptural Mantras). The king saw all animals, again, which belong<br>to land and all those which belong to water, collected there on the<br>occasion. And they also beheld many kine and many buffaloes and many old<br>women, and many aquatic animals, many beasts of prey and many species of<br>birds, and many specimens of viviparous and oviparous creatures, and many<br>that are filth-born, and many belonging to the vegetable kingdom, and<br>many animals and plants that live or grow on mountains. Beholding the<br>sacrificial compound thus adorned with animals and kine and corn, the<br>invited kings became filled with wonder. Large heaps of costly<br>sweet-meats were kept ready for both the Brahmanas and the Vaisyas. And<br>when the feeding was over of a hundred thousand Brahmanas, drums and<br>cymbals were beat. And so large was the number fed that the sounds of<br>drums and cymbals were repeatedly heard, indeed, from day to day those<br>sounds continued. Thus was performed that sacrifice of king Yudhishthira<br>of great intelligence. Many hills of food, O king, were dedicated on the<br>occasion. Many large tanks were seen of curds and many lakes of ghee. In<br>that great sacrifice, O monarch, was seen the entire population of<br>Jamvudwipa, with all its realms and provinces, collected together.<br>Thousands of nations and races were there. A large number of men, O chief<br>of Bharata's race, adorned with garlands and wearing bright ear-rings<br>made of gold, taking innumerable vessels in their hands, distributed the<br>food unto the regenerate classes by hundreds and thousands. The<br>attendants of the Pandavas gave away unto the Brahmanas diverge kinds of<br>food and drink which were, besides, so costly as to be worthy of being<br>eaten and drunk by kings themselves.'"
