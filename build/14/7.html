                            "Samvarta said, 'How hast thou come to know me, and who has referred thee<br>to me, do thou tell this to me truly, if thou wishest me to do what is<br>good to thee. And if thou speak truly, thou shalt attain all the objects<br>of thy desire, and shouldst thou tell a lie, thy head shall be riven in a<br>hundred pieces.'<br><br>Marutta said, 'I have been told by Narada, wandering on his way, that<br>thou art the son of our family-priest, and this (information) has<br>inclined my mind (towards thee), with exquisite satisfaction.'<br><br>Samvarta said, 'Thou hast told this to me truly. He (Narada) knows me to<br>be a performer of sacrifices. Now tell me where is Narada living at<br>present.'<br><br>Marutta said, 'That prince of celestial saints (Narada) having given me<br>this information about thee, and commended me to thy care, has entered<br>into the fire.'<br><br>Vyasa said, 'Hearing these words from the king (Marutta) Samvarta was<br>highly gratified, and he said (addressing Marutta). 'I too am quite able<br>to do all that.' Then, O prince, that Brahmana, raving like a lunatic,<br>and repeatedly scolding Marutta with rude words, again accosted him thus,<br>'I am afflicted with a cerebral disorder, and, I always act according to<br>the random caprices of my own mind. Why art thou bent upon having this<br>sacrifice performed by a priest of such a singular disposition? My<br>brother is able to officiate at sacrifices, and he has gone over to<br>Vasava (Indra), and is engaged in performing his sacrifices, do thou<br>therefore have thy sacrifice performed by him. My elder brother has<br>forcibly taken away from me all my household goods and mystical gods, and<br>sacrificing clients, and has now left to me only this physical body of<br>mine, and, O son of Avikshit, as he is worthy of all respect from me, I<br>cannot by any means officiate at thy sacrifice, unless with his<br>permission. Thou must therefore go to Vrihaspati first, and taking his<br>permission thou canst come back to me, if thou hast any desire to perform<br>a sacrifice, and then only shall I officiate at thy sacrifice.'<br><br>Marutta said, 'Do thou listen to me, O Samvarta, I did go to Vrihaspati<br>first, but desiring the patronage of Vasava, he did not wish to have me<br>as his sacrificer. He said, 'Having secured the priesthood of the<br>Immortals, I do not desire to act for mortals, and, I have been forbidden<br>by Sakra (Indra) to officiate at Marutta's sacrifice, as he told me that<br>Marutta having become lord of the earth, was always filled with a desire<br>to rival him.' And to this thy brother assented by saying to the Slayer<br>of Vala (Indra),&#8212;Be it so. Know thou, O best of ascetics, that as he had<br>succeeded in securing the protection of the Lord of the Celestials, I<br>repaired to him with gratified heart, but he did not agree to act as my<br>priest. And thus repulsed, I now desire to spend all I possess, to have<br>this sacrifice performed by thee, and to outstrip Vasava by the merit of<br>thy good offices. As I have been repulsed by Vrihaspati for no fault of<br>mine, I have now no desire, O Brahmana, to go to him to seek his aid in<br>this sacrifice."<br><br>Samvarta said, 'I can certainly, O king, accomplish all that thou<br>desirest, if only thou agree to do all that I shall ask thee to do, but I<br>apprehend that Vrihaspati and Purandara (Indra) when they will learn that<br>I am engaged in performing thy sacrifice, will be filled with wrath, and<br>do all they can to injure thee. Therefore, do thou assure me of thy<br>steadfastness, so as to ensure my coolness and constancy, as otherwise.<br>if I am filled with wrath against thee, I shall reduce (destroy) thee and<br>thy kindred to ashes."<br><br>Marutta said, 'If ever I forsake thee, may I never attain the blessed<br>regions as long as the mountains shall exist, and the thousand-rayed sun<br>continue to emit heat: if I forsake dice, may I never attain true wisdom,<br>and remain for ever addicted to worldly (material) pursuits."<br><br>Samvarta said, "Listen, O son of Avikshit, excellent as it is the bent of<br>thy mind to perform this act, so too, O king, have I in my mind the<br>ability to perform the sacrifice, I tell thee, O king, that thy good<br>things will become imperishable, and that thou shalt lord it over Sakra<br>and the Celestials with Gandharvas. For myself, I have no desire to amass<br>wealth or sacrificial presents, I shall only do what is disagreeable to<br>both Indra and my brother, I shall certainly make thee attain equality<br>with Sakra, and I tell thee truly that I shall do what is agreeable to<br>thee."
