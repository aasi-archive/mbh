                            "Brahmana said, 'Some regard Brahman as a tree. Some regard Brahman as a<br>great forest. Some regard Brahman as unmanifest. Some regard it as<br>transcendant and freed from every distress. They think that all this is<br>produced from and absorbed into the unmanifest. He who, even for the<br>short space of time that is taken by a single breath, when his end comes,<br>becomes equable, attaining to the self, fits himself for immortality.<br>Restraining the self in the self, even for the space of a wink, one goes,<br>through the tranquillity of the self, to that which constitutes the<br>inexhaustible acquisition of those that are endued with knowledge.<br>Restraining the life-breaths again and again by controlling them<br>according to the method called Pranayama, by the ten or the twelve, he<br>attains to that which is beyond the four and twenty. Thus having first<br>acquired a tranquil soul, one attains to the fruition of all one's<br>wishes.[144] When the quality of Goodness predominates in that which<br>arises from the Unmanifest, it becomes fit for immortality. They who are<br>conversant with Goodness applaud it highly, saying that there is nothing<br>higher than Goodness. By inference we know that Purusha is dependent on<br>Goodness. Ye best of regenerate ones, it is impossible to attain to<br>Purusha by any other means. Forgiveness, courage, abstention from harm,<br>equability, truth, sincerity, knowledge, gift, and renunciation, are said<br>to be the characteristics of that course of conduct which arises out of<br>Goodness. It is by this inference that the wise believe in the identity<br>of Purusha and Goodness, There is no doubt in this. Some learned men that<br>are devoted to knowledge assert the unity of Kshetrajna and Nature. This,<br>however, is not correct. It is said that Nature is different from<br>Purusha: that also will imply a want to consideration. Truly, distinction<br>and association should be known (as applying to Purusha and Nature).<br>Unity and diversity are likewise laid down. That is the doctrine of the<br>learned. In the Gnat and Udumbara both unity and diversity are seen. As a<br>fish in water is different from it, such is the relation of the two<br>(viz., Purusha and Nature). Verily, their relation is like that of water<br>drops on the leaf of the lotus.'"<br><br>"The preceptor continued, 'Thus addressed, those learned Brahmanas, who<br>were the foremost of men, felt some doubts and (therefore) they once more<br>questioned the Grandsire (of all creatures).'"[145]
