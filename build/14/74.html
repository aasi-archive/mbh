                            "Vaisampayana said. 'A battle took place between the diadem-decked<br>(Arjuna) and the sons and grandsons of the Trigartas whose hostility the<br>Pandavas has incurred before and all of whom were well-known as mighty<br>car-warriors. Having learnt that that foremost of steeds, which was<br>intended for the sacrifice, had come to their realm, these heroes, casing<br>themselves in mail, surrounded Arjuna. Mounted on their cars, drawn by<br>excellent and well-decked horses, and with quivers on their backs, they<br>surrounded that horse, O king, and endeavoured to capture it. The<br>diadem-decked Arjuna, reflecting on that endeavour of theirs, forbade<br>those heroes, with conciliatory speeches, O chastiser of foes.<br>Disregarding Arjuna's message, they assailed him with their shafts. The<br>diadem-decked Arjuna resisted those warriors who were under the sway of<br>darkness and passion. Jishnu, addressed them smilingly and said, 'Desist,<br>ye unrighteous ones. Life is a benefit (that should not be thrown away).'<br>At the time of his setting out, he had been earnestly ordered by king<br>Yudhishthira the just, not to slay those Kshatriyas whose kinsmen had<br>been slain before on the field of Kurukshetra. Recollecting these<br>commands of king Yudhishthira the just who was endued with great<br>intelligence, Arjuna asked the Trigartas to forbear. But they disregarded<br>Arjuna's injunction. Then Arjuna vanquished Suryavarman, the king of the<br>Trigartas, in battle, by shooting countless shafts at him and laughed in<br>scorn. The Trigarta warriors, however, filling the ten points with the<br>clatter of their cars and car-wheels, rushed towards Dhananjaya. Then<br>Suryavarman, displaying his great lightness of hand, pierced Dhananjaya<br>with hundreds of straight arrows, O monarch. The other great bowmen who<br>followed the king and who were all desirous of compassing the destruction<br>of Dhananjaya, shot showers of arrows on him. With countless shafts shot<br>from his own bow-siring, the son of Pandu, O king, cut off those clouds<br>of arrows; upon which they fell down. Endued with great energy,<br>Ketuvarman, the younger brother of Suryavarman, and possessed of youthful<br>vigour, fought, for the sake of his brother, against Pandu's son<br>possessed of great fame. Beholding Ketuvarman approaching towards him for<br>battle, Vibhatsu, that slayer of hostile heroes, slew him with many<br>sharp-pointed arrows. Upon Ketuvarman's fall, the mighty car-warrior<br>Dhritavarman, rushing on his car towards Arjuna, showered a perfect<br>downpour of arrows on him. Beholding that lightness of hand displayed by<br>the youth Dhritavarman, Gudakesa of mighty energy and great prowess<br>became highly gratified with him. The son of Indra could not see when the<br>young warrior took out his arrows and when he placed them on his<br>bow-string aiming at him. He only saw showers of arrows in the air. For a<br>brief space of time, Arjuna gladdened his enemy and mentally admired his<br>heroism and skill. The Kuru hero, smiling the while, fought with that<br>youth who resembled an angry snake. The mighty armed Dhananjaya, glad as<br>he was in beholding the valour of Dhritavarman, did not take his life.<br>While, however, Partha of immeasurable energy fought mildly with him<br>without wishing to take his life, Dhritavarman shot a blazing arrow at<br>him. Deeply pierced in the hand by that arrow, Vijaya became stupefied<br>and his bow Gandiva fell down on the Earth from his relaxed grasp. The<br>form of that bow, O king, when it fell from the grasp of Arjuna,<br>resembled, O Bharata, that of the bow of Indra (that is seen in the<br>welkin after a shower). When that great and celestial bow fell down, O<br>monarch, Dhritavarman laughed loudly in battle. At this, Jishnu, excited<br>with rage, wiped the blood from his hand and once more taking up his bow,<br>showered a perfect downpour of arrows. Then a loud and confused noise<br>arose, filling the welkin and touching the very heavens as it were, from<br>diverse creatures who applauded that feat of Dhananjaya. Beholding Jishnu<br>inflamed with rage and looking like Yama himself as he appears at the end<br>of the Yuga, the Trigarta warriors hastily surrounded him, rushing from<br>their posts and desirous of rescuing Dhritavarman. Seeing himself<br>surrounded by his foes, Arjuna became more angry than before. He then<br>quickly despatched eight and ten of their foremost warriors with many<br>shafts of hard iron that resembled the arrows of the great Indra himself.<br>The Trigarta warriors then began to fly. Seeing them retreat, Dhananjaya,<br>with great speed, shot many shafts at them that resembled wrathful snakes<br>of virulent poison, and laughed aloud. The mighty car-warriors of the<br>Trigartas, with dispirited hearts, fled in all directions, exceedingly<br>afflicted by Dhananjaya with his arrows. They then addressed that tiger<br>among men, that slayer of the Samsaptaka host (on the field of<br>Kurukshetra), saying, 'We are your slaves. We yield to thee.[190] Do thou<br>command us, O Partha. Lo, we wait here as the most docile of thy<br>servants. O delighter of the Kurus, we shall execute all thy commands.'<br>Hearing these words expressive of their submission, Dhananjaya, said unto<br>them, 'Do ye, O kings, save your lives, and accept my dominion.'"
