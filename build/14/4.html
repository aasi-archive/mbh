                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O righteous one, I am desirous of hearing the<br>history of that royal sage Marutta. Do thou, O Dwaipayana, relate this<br>unto me, O sinless one.'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'O child, in the Krita age Manu was lord (of the Earth)<br>wielding the sceptre. His son was known under the name of Prasandhi.<br>Prasandhi had a son named Kshupa, Kshupa's son was that lord (of men),<br>king Ikshwaku. He, O king, had a hundred sons endowed with pre-eminent<br>piety. And all of them were made monarchs by king Ikshwaku. The eldest of<br>them, Vinsa by name became the model of bowmen. Vinsa's son, O Bharata,<br>was the auspicious Vivinsa. Vivinsa, O king, had five and ten sons; all<br>of them were powerful archers, reverencial to the Brahmanas and truthful,<br>gentle and ever speaking fair. The eldest brother, Khaninetra, oppressed<br>all his brothers. And having conquered the entire kingdom rid of all<br>troubles, Khaninetra could not retain his supremacy; nor were the people<br>pleased with him. And dethroning him, they, O foremost of monarchs,<br>invested his son Suvarcha with the rights of sovereignty and (having<br>effected this) experienced joy (in their hearts). Seeing the reverses<br>sustained by his site as well as his expulsion from the empire, he was<br>ever intent on bringing about the welfare of the people, being devoted to<br>the Brahmanas, speaking the truth, practising purity and restraining his<br>senses and thoughts. And the subjects were well pleased with that<br>high-minded one constant in virtue. But he being constantly engaged in<br>virtuous deeds, his treasures and vehicles became greatly reduced. And on<br>his treasury having become depleted, the feudatory princes swarming round<br>him began to give him trouble. Being thus oppressed by many foes while<br>his treasury, horses and vehicles were impoverished, the king underwent<br>great tribulation along with his retainers and the denizens of his<br>capital. Although his power waned greatly, yet the foes could not slay<br>the king, for his power, O Yudhishthira, was established in<br>righteousness. And when he had reached the extreme of misery along with<br>the citizens, he blew his hand (with his mouth), and from that there<br>appeared a supply of forces. And then he vanquished all the kings living<br>along the borders of his dominions. And from this circumstance O king, he<br>hath been celebrated as Karandhama. His son, (the first) Karandhama who<br>was born at the beginning of the Treta age, equalled Indra himself and<br>was endowed with grace, and invincible even by the immortals. At that<br>time all the kings were under his control; and alike by virtue of his<br>wealth and for his prowess, he became their emperor. In short, the<br>righteous king Avikshit by name, became like unto Indra himself in<br>heroism; and he was given to sacrifices, delight took in virtue and held<br>his senses under restraint. And in energy he resembled the sun and in<br>forbearance Earth herself; in intelligence, he was like Vrihaspati, and<br>in calmness the mountain Himavat himself. And that king delighted the<br>hearts of his subjects by act, thought, speech, self-restraint, and<br>forbearance. He performed hundreds of horse-sacrifices, and the potent<br>and learned Angira himself served him as priest. His son surpassed his<br>sire in the possession of good qualities. Named Marutta, that lord of<br>kings was righteous and o great renown, an possessed the might of ten<br>thousand elephants. He was like unto Vishnu's second self. Desirous of<br>celebrating a sacrifice, that virtuous monarch, coming to Mount Meru on<br>the northern side of Himavat, caused thousands of shining golden vessels<br>to be forged. There on a huge golden hill he performed the rites. And<br>goldsmiths made basins and vessels and pans and seats without number. And<br>the sacrificial ground was near this place. And that righteous lord of<br>Earth, king Marutta, along with other princes, performed a sacrifice<br>there.'"
