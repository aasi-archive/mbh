                            "Vasudeva said, "There are two kinds of ailments, physical and mental.<br>They are produced by the mutual action of the body and mind on each<br>other, and they never arise without the interaction of the two. The<br>ailment that is produced in the body, is called the physical ailment, and<br>that which has its seat in the mind, is known as the mental ailment. The<br>cold, the warm (phlegm and bile) as well as the windy humours, O king,<br>are the essential transformations generated in the physical body, and<br>when these humours are evenly distributed, and are present in due<br>proportions, they are said to be symptomatic of good health. The warm<br>humour is acted upon (allayed) by the cold, and the cold by the warm. And<br>Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas are the attributes of the soul, and it is said by<br>the learned that their presence in due proportions indicates health (of<br>the mind). But if any of the three preponderates, some remedy is enjoined<br>(to restore the equilibrium). Happiness is overcome by sorrow, and sorrow<br>by pleasure. Some people while afflicted by sorrow, desire to recall<br>(past) happiness, while others, while in the enjoyment of happiness,<br>desire to recall past sorrow. But thou, O son of Kunti, dost neither<br>desire to recall thy sorrows nor thy happiness; what else dost thou<br>desire to recall barring this delusion of sorrow? Or, perchance, O son,<br>of Pritha, it is thy innate nature, by which thou art at present<br>overpowered. Thou dost not desire to recall to thy mind the painful sight<br>of Krishna standing in the hall of assembly with only one piece of cloth<br>to cover her body, and while she was in her menses and in the presence of<br>all the Pandavas. And it is not meet that thou shouldst brood over thy<br>departure from the city, and thy exile with the hide of the antelope for<br>thy robe, and thy wanderings in the great forest, nor shouldst thou<br>recall to thy mind the affliction from Jatasura, the fight with<br>Chitrasena, and thy troubles from the Saindhavas. Nor it is proper, O son<br>of Pritha, and conqueror of thy foes, that thou shouldst recall the<br>incident of Kichaka's kicking Draupadi, during the period of thy exile<br>passed in absolute concealment, nor the incidents of the fight which took<br>place between thyself and Drona and Bhishma. The time has now arrived,<br>when thou must fight the battle which each must fight single-handed with<br>his mind. Therefore, O chief of Bharata's race, thou must now prepare to<br>carry the struggle against thy mind, and by dint of abstraction and the<br>merit of thine own Karma, thou must reach the other side of (overcome)<br>the mysterious and unintelligible (mind). In this war there will be no<br>need for any missiles, nor for friends, nor attendants. The battle which<br>is to be fought alone and single-handed has now arrived for thee. And if<br>vanquished in this struggle, thou shalt find thyself in the most wretched<br>plight, and O son of Kunti, knowing this, and acting accordingly, shalt<br>thou attain success. And knowing this wisdom and the destiny of all<br>creatures, and following the conduct of thy ancestors, do thou duly<br>administer thy kingdom."
