                            "Vaisampayana said, "With such speeches as these, was the royal saint<br>Yudhishthira, bereft of his friends, consoled by those sages of great<br>ascetic merits. And O monarch, that lord of men exhorted by the<br>worshipful Viswarasraba himself, and by Dwaipayana (Vyasa), Krishna<br>Devasthana, Narada, Bhima, Nakula, Krishna (Draupadi), Sahadeva, and the<br>sharpwitted Vijaya, as well as by other great men, and Brahmanas versed<br>in the Sastras, became relieved of all mental affliction and sorrow<br>arising from the death of his dear relations. And that monarch<br>Yudhishthira after performing the obsequial ceremonies of his departed<br>friends, and honouring the Brahmanas and Devas (gods), brought the<br>kingdom of the earth with its girdle of oceans, under his sway. And that<br>prince of Kuru's race having regained his kingdom, with a tranquil mind,<br>thus addressed Vyasa, Narada and the other sages who were present. I have<br>been comforted by the words of so great, ancient and aged saints as<br>yourselves, and I have now no cause left for the least affliction. And<br>likewise, I have attained great wealth, with which I may worship the<br>gods. Therefore, with your assistance, I shall now perform the sacrifice,<br>O the best of regenerate beings. We have heard that those (Himalayan)<br>regions are full of wonders. Therefore, O Brahmana, saint and grandsire<br>do thou so ordain that under thy protection we may safety reach the<br>Himalaya mountains, the performance of my sacrifice being entirely within<br>thy control, and then the adorable celestial saint Narada and Devasthana<br>have also addressed exquisite and well-meaning words for our well being.<br>No unlucky man in times of great tribulation and distress, has ever the<br>good fortune to secure the services of such preceptors and friends<br>approved by all virtuous men. Thus addressed by the king, those great<br>saints, bidding the king and Krishna and Arjuna to repair to the<br>Himalayan regions, then and there vanished in the presence of the<br>assembled multitude, and the king, the lordly son of Dharma, then seated<br>himself there for a while. And the Pandavas then in consequence of the<br>death of Bhishma, were engaged in performing his funeral ceremonies. And<br>their time, while thus engaged, seemed too long in passing and performing<br>the last rites to the mortal remains of Bhishma, Karna and other foremost<br>Kauravas, they gave away large presents to Brahmanas. And then the<br>foremost descendant of Kuru again performed with Dhritarashtra the<br>funeral rites (of the heroes slain in battle), and having given away<br>immense wealth to the Brahmanas, the Pandava chief with Dhritarashtra in<br>advance, made this entry into the city of Hastina Nagar, and consoling<br>his lordly uncle, possessed of eyes of wisdom, that virtuous prince<br>continued to administer the earth with his brothers.
