                            "The Brahmana said, 'I do not smell scents. I do not perceive tastes. I<br>do not see colours. I do not touch. I do not likewise hear the diverse<br>sounds (that arise). Nor do I entertain purposes of any kind. It is<br>Nature that desires such objects as are liked; it is Nature that hates<br>such objects as are disliked. Desire and aversion spring from Nature,<br>after the manner of the upward and the downward life-winds when souls<br>have entered animate bodies. Separated from them are others; in them are<br>eternal dispositions; (these as also) the soul of all creatures, Yogins<br>would behold in the body. Dwelling in that, I am never attached to<br>anything through desire and wrath, and decrepitude and death. Not having<br>any desire for any object of desire, and not having any aversion for any<br>evil, there is no taint on my natures, as there is no taint of a drop of<br>water on (the leaves of) the lotus. Of this constant (principle) which<br>looks upon diverse natures, they are inconstant possessions.[77] Though<br>actions are performed, yet the assemblage of enjoyments does not attach<br>itself to them, even as the assemblage of rays of the sun does not attach<br>to the sky. In this connection is recited an ancient story of a discourse<br>between an Adhwaryu and a Yati. Do thou hear it, O glorious lady.<br>Beholding an animal sprinkled with water at a sacrificial ceremony, a<br>Yati said unto the Adhwaryu seated there these words in censure,&#8212;This is<br>destruction of life! unto him the Adhwaryu said in reply,&#8212;This goat will<br>not be destroyed. The animal (sacrificed) meets with great good, if the<br>Vedic declaration on this subject be true. That part of this animal which<br>is of earth will go to earth. That part of this one which is born of<br>water, will enter into water. His eye will enter the sun; his ear will<br>enter the different points of the horizon; his life-winds will enter the<br>sky. I who adhere to the scriptures incur no fault (by assisting at the<br>killing of this animal).'<br><br>"The Yati said, 'If thou beholdest such good to the goat in this<br>dissociation with (his) life-winds, then this sacrifice is for the goat.<br>What need hast thou for it? Let the brother, father, mother, and friend<br>(of this goat) give thee their approval in this. Taking him (to them) do<br>thou consult them. This goat is especially dependent. It behoveth thee to<br>see them who can give their consent in this. After hearing their consent;<br>the matter will become fit for consideration. The life-winds of this goat<br>have been made to return to their respective sources. Only the inanimate<br>body remains behind. This is what I think. Of those who wish to enjoy<br>felicity by means of the inanimate body (of an animal) which is<br>comparable with fuel, the fuel (of sacrifice) is after all the animal<br>himself. Abstention from cruelty is the foremost of all deities. Even<br>this is the teaching of the elders. We know this is the proposition,<br>viz.,&#8212;No slaughter (of living creatures).&#8212;If I say anything further,<br>(it will then appear that) diverse kinds of faulty actions are capable of<br>being done by thee. Always abstaining from cruelty to all creatures is<br>what meets with our approbation. We establish this from what is directly<br>perceptible. We do not rely on what is beyond direct perception.'<br><br>"The Adhwaryu said, 'Thou enjoyest the properties of smell which belong<br>to the earth. Thou drinkest the tastes which appertain to water. Thou<br>seest colours which belong to lighted bodies. Thou touchest the<br>properties which, have their origin in wind. Thou hearest the sounds<br>which have their origin in space (or ether). Thou thinkest thoughts with<br>the mind. All these entities, thou art of opinion, have life. Thou dost<br>not then abstain from taking life. Really, thou art engaged in slaughter.<br>There can be no movement without slaughter. Or, what dost thou think, O<br>regenerate one.'<br><br>"The Yati said, 'The Indestructible and the Destructible constitute the<br>double manifestation of the soul. Of these the Indestructible is existed.<br>The Destructible is said to be exceedingly non-existent.[78] The<br>life-wind, the tongue, the mind, the quality of goodness, along with the<br>quality of passion, are all existent. The Atman is above these forms and<br>hence is without duality and hope. As regards one that is freed from<br>these existent objects, that transcends all pairs of opposites, that does<br>not cherish any expectation, that is alike to all creatures, that is<br>liberated from the idea of meum, that has subjugated his self, and that<br>is released from all his surroundings,&#8212;for him no fear exists from any<br>source!'[79]<br><br>"The Adhwaryu said, 'O foremost of intelligent men, one should reside<br>with those that are good. Hearing thy opinion my understanding shines<br>with light. O illustrious one, I come to thee, believing thee to be a<br>god; and I say I have no fault, O regenerate one, by performing these<br>rites with the aid of Mantras!'[80]<br><br>"The Brahmana continued, 'With this conclusion, the Yati remained silent<br>after this. The Adhwaryu also proceeded with the great sacrifice, freed<br>from delusion. The Brahmanas understand Emancipation, which is<br>exceedingly subtle, to be of this kind and having understood it, they<br>live accordingly directed by the Kshetrajna, that beholder of all<br>topics.'"
