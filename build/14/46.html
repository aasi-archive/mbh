                            "Brahmana said, 'Duly studying thus to the best of his power, in the way<br>described above, and likewise living as a Brahmacharin, one that is<br>devoted to the duties of one's own order, possessed of learning,<br>observant of penances, and with all the senses under restraint, devoted<br>to what is agreeable and beneficial to the preceptor, steady in<br>practising the duty of truth, and always pure, should, with the<br>permission of the preceptor, eat one's food without decrying it. He<br>should eat Havishya made from what is obtained in alms, and should stand,<br>sit, and take exercise (as directed).[136] He should pour libations on<br>the fire twice a day, having purified himself and with concentrated mind.<br>He should always bear a staff made of Vilwa or Palasa.[137] The robes of<br>the regenerate man should be linen, or of cotton, or deer-skin, or a<br>cloth that is entirely brown-red. There should also be a girdle made of<br>Munja-grass. He should bear matted locks on head, and should perform his<br>ablutions every day. He should bear the sacred thread, study the<br>scriptures, divest himself of cupidity, and be steady in the observance<br>of vows. He should also gratify the deities with oblations of pure water,<br>his mind being restrained the while. Such a Brahmacharin is worthy of<br>applause. With vital seed drawn up and mind concentrated, one that is<br>thus devoted succeeds in conquering Heaven. Having attained to the<br>highest seat, he has not to return to birth. Cleansed by all purificatory<br>rites and having lived as a Brahmacharin, one should next go out of one's<br>village and next live as an ascetic in the woods, having renounced (all<br>attachments). Clad in animal skins or barks of trees he should perform<br>his ablutions morning and evening. Always living within the forest, he<br>should never return to an inhabited place. Honouring guests when they<br>come, he should give them shelter, and himself subsist upon fruits and<br>leaves and common roots, and Syamaka. He should, without being slothful<br>subsist on such water as he gets, and air, and all forest products. He<br>should live upon these, in due order, according to the regulations of his<br>initiation.[138] He should honour the guest that comes to him with alms<br>of fruits and roots. He should then, without sloth, always give whatever<br>other food he may have. Restraining speech the while, he should eat after<br>gratifying deities and guests. His mind should be free from envy. He<br>should eat little, and depend always on the deities. Self-restrained,<br>practising universal compassion, and possessed of forgiveness, he should<br>wear both beard and hair (without submitting to the operations of the<br>barber). Performing sacrifices and devoting himself to the study of the<br>scriptures, he should be steady in the observance of the duty of truth.<br>With body always in a state of purity, endued with cleverness, ever<br>dwelling in the forest, with concentrated mind, and senses in subjection,<br>a forest-recluse, thus devoting himself, would conquer Heaven. A<br>householder, or Brahmacharin, or forest-recluse, who would wish to<br>achieve Emancipation, should have recourse to that which has been called<br>the best course of conduct. Having granted unto all creatures the pledge<br>of utter abstention from harm, he should thoroughly renounce all action.<br>He should contribute to the happiness of all creatures, practise<br>universal friendliness, subjugate all his senses, and be an ascetic.<br>Subsisting upon food obtained without asking and without trouble, and<br>that has come to him spontaneously, he should make a fire. He should make<br>his round of mendicancy in a place whence smoke has ceased to curl up and<br>where all the inhabitants have already eaten.[139] The person who is<br>conversant with the conduct that leads to Emancipation should seek for<br>alms after the vessels (used in cooking) have been washed. He should<br>never rejoice when he obtains anything, and never be depressed if he<br>obtains nothing. Seeking just what is needed for supporting life, he<br>should, with concentrated mind, go about his round of mendicancy, waiting<br>for the proper time. He should not wish for earnings in common with<br>others, nor eat when honoured. The man who leads the life of mendicancy<br>should conceal himself for avoiding gifts with honour. While eating, he<br>should not eat such food as forms the remains of another's dish, nor such<br>as is bitter, or astringent, or pungent. He should not also eat such<br>kinds of food as have a sweet taste. He should eat only so much as is<br>needed to keep him alive. The person conversant with Emancipation should<br>obtain his subsistence without obstructing any creature. In his rounds of<br>mendicancy he should never follow another (bent on the same purpose). He<br>should never parade his piety; he should move about in a secluded place,<br>freed from passion. Either an empty house, or a forest, or the foot of<br>some tree, or a river, or a mountain-cave, he should have recourse to for<br>shelter. In summer he should pass only one night in an inhabited place;<br>in the season of rains he may live in one place. He should move about the<br>world like a worm, his path pointed out by the Sun. From compassion for<br>creatures, he should walk on the Earth with his eyes directed towards it.<br>He should never make any accumulations and should avoid residence with<br>friends. The man conversant with Emancipation should every day do all his<br>acts with pure water. Such a man should always perform his ablutions with<br>water that has been fetched up (from the river or the tank).[140]<br>Abstention from harm, Brahmacharyya, truth, simplicity, freedom from<br>wrath, freedom from decrying others, self-restraint, and habitual freedom<br>from backbiting: these eight vows, with senses restrained, he should<br>steadily pursue. He should always practise a sinless mode of conduct,<br>that is not deceptive and not crooked. Freed from attachment, he should<br>always make one who comes as a guest eat (at least) a morsel of food. He<br>should eat just enough for livelihood, for the support of life. He should<br>eat only such food as has been obtained by righteous means, and should<br>not pursue the dictates of desire. He should never accept any other thing<br>than food and clothing only. He should, again, accept only as much as he<br>can eat and nothing more. He should not be induced to accept gifts from<br>others, nor should he make gifts to others. Owing to the helplessness of<br>creatures, the man of wisdom should always share with others. He should<br>not appropriate what belongs to others, nor should he take anything<br>without being asked. He should not, having enjoyed anything become so<br>attached to it as to desire to have it once more. One should take only<br>earth and water and pebbles and leaves and flowers and fruits, that are<br>not owned by any body, as they come, when one desires to do any act. One<br>should not live by the occupation of an artisan, nor should one covet<br>gold. One should not hate, nor teach (one that does not seek to be<br>taught); nor should one have any belongings. One should eat only what is<br>consecrated by faith. One should abstain from controversies. One should<br>follow that course of conduct which has been said to be nectarine. One<br>should never be attached to anything, and should never enter into<br>relations of intimacy with any creature. One should not perform, nor<br>cause to perform, any such action as involves expectation of fruit or<br>destruction of life or the hoarding of wealth or articles. Rejecting all<br>objects, content with a very little, one should wander about (homeless)<br>pursuing an equal behaviour towards all creatures mobile and immobile.<br>One should never annoy another being; not should one be annoyed with<br>another. He who is trusted by all creatures is regarded as the foremost<br>of those persons that understand Emancipation. One should not think of<br>the past, nor feel anxious about the future. One should disregard the<br>present, biding time, with concentrated mind.[141] One should never<br>defile anything by eye, mind, or speech. Nor should one do anything that<br>is wrong, openly or in secret. Withdrawing one's senses like the tortoise<br>withdrawing its limbs, one should attenuate one's senses and mind,<br>cultivate a thoroughly peaceful understanding, and seek to master every<br>topic. Freed from all pairs of opposites, never bending one's head in<br>reverence, abstaining from the rites requiring the utterance of Swaha,<br>one should be free from mineness, and egoism. With cleansed soul, one<br>should never seek to acquire what one has not and protect what one has.<br>Free from expectations, divested of qualities, wedded to tranquillity,<br>one should be free from all attachments and should depend on none.<br>Attached to one's own self and comprehending all topics, one becomes<br>emancipated without doubt. Those who perceive the self, which is without<br>hands and feet and back, which is without head and without stomach, which<br>is free from the operation of all qualities, which is absolute,<br>untainted, and stable, which is without smell, without taste, and touch,<br>without colour, and without sound, which is to be comprehended (by close<br>study), which is unattached, which is without flesh, which is free from<br>anxiety, unfading, and divine, and, lastly, which though dwelling in a<br>house resides in all creatures, succeed in escaping death. There the<br>understanding reaches not, nor the senses, nor the deities, nor the<br>Vedas, nor sacrifices, nor the regions (of superior bliss), nor penance,<br>nor vows. The attainment to it by those who are possessed of knowledge is<br>said to be without comprehension of symbols. Hence, the man who knows the<br>properties of that which is destitute of symbols, should practise the<br>truths of piety.[142] The learned man, betaking himself to a life of<br>domesticity, should adopt that conduct which is conformable to true<br>knowledge. Though undeluded, he should practise piety after the manner of<br>one that is deluded, without finding fault with it. Without finding fault<br>with the practices of the good, he should himself adopt such a conduct<br>for practising piety as may induce others to always disrespect him. That<br>man who is endued with such a conduct is said to be the foremost of<br>ascetics. The senses, the objects of the senses, the (five) great<br>elements, mind, understanding, egoism, the unmanifest, Purusha also,<br>after comprehending these duly with the aid of correct inferences, one<br>attains to Heaven, released from all bonds. One conversant with the<br>truth, understanding these at the time of the termination of his life,<br>should meditate, exclusively resting on one point. Then, depending on<br>none, one attains to Emancipation. Freed from all attachments, like the<br>wind in space, with his accumulations exhausted, without distress of any<br>kind, he attains to his highest goal.'"
