                            "The Brahmana said, 'I do not, O timid one, move in this world in that<br>manner which thou, according to thy own understanding, censurest. I am a<br>Brahmana possessed of Vedic knowledge, I am emancipated. I am a forest<br>recluse. I am an observer of the duties of a house-holder. I observe<br>vows. I am not what thou seest me in good and bad acts. By me is pervaded<br>everything that exists in this universe. Whatever creatures exist in the<br>world, mobile or immobile, know that I am the destroyer of them all, even<br>as fire is (the destroyer) of all kinds of wood. Of sovereignty over the<br>whole Earth or over Heaven (on the one hand), or this knowledge (of my<br>identity with the universe), this knowledge is my wealth.[93] This is the<br>one path for Brahmanas, by which they who understand it proceed to<br>house-holds, or abodes in the forest, or residence with preceptors, or<br>among mendicants.[94] With numerous unconfused symbols, only one<br>knowledge is worshipped. Those who, whatever the symbols and modes of<br>life to which they adhere, have acquired an understanding having<br>tranquillity for its essence, attain to that one entity even as numerous<br>rivers all meeting the Ocean.[95] The path is traversable with the aid of<br>the understanding and not of this body. Actions have both beginning and<br>end, and the body has actions for its bonds.[96] Hence, O blessed lady,<br>thou needst have no apprehension in respect of the world hereafter. With<br>thy heart intent upon the real entity, it is my soul into which thou wilt<br>come.'"
