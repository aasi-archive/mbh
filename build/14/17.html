                            "Vasudeva said, touching the feet of that sage, the Brahmana asked him<br>some questions that were exceedingly difficult to answer. That foremost<br>of all righteous persons then discoursed on those duties that were<br>referred to.<br><br>'Kasyapa said, 'How does the body dissolve away, and how is another<br>acquired? How does one become emancipated after passing through a<br>repeated round of painful rebirths? Enjoying Prakriti for sometime, how<br>does Jiva cast off the particular body (which Prakriti gives)? How does<br>Jiva, freed from the body, attain to what is different from it (viz.,<br>Brahman)? How does a human being enjoy (and endure the fruits of) the<br>good and bad acts done by him? Where do the acts exist of one that is<br>devoid of body?[10]<br><br>'The Brahmana said,&#8212;Thus urged by Kasyapa, the emancipated sage answered<br>those questions one after another. Do thou listen to me, O scion of the<br>Vrishi race, as I recite to thee the answers he made.'<br><br>'&#8212;The Emancipated sage said, 'Upon the exhaustion of those acts capable<br>of prolonging life and bringing on fame which are done in a particular<br>body that Jiva assumes, the embodied Jiva, with the span of his life<br>shortened, begins to do acts hostile to life and health. On the approach<br>of destruction, his understanding turns away from the proper course. The<br>man of uncleansed soul, after even a correct apprehension of his<br>constitution and strength and of the season of both his own life and of<br>the year, begins to eat at irregular intervals and to eat such food as is<br>hostile to him.[11] At such a time he indulges in practices that are<br>exceedingly harmful. He sometimes eats excessively and sometimes abstains<br>altogether from food. He eats bad food or bad meat or takes bad drinks,<br>or food that has been made up of ingredients incompatible with one<br>another. He eats food that is heavy in excess of the measure that is<br>beneficial, or before the food previously taken has been digested. He<br>indulges in physical exercise and sexual pleasure in excess of the due<br>measure, or through avidity for work, suppresses the urgings of his<br>corporeal organism even when they become pronounced. Or, he takes food<br>that is very juicy, or indulges in sleep during daytime. Food that is not<br>properly digested, of itself excites the faults, when the time comes.[12]<br>From such excitement of the faults in his body, he gets disease ending in<br>death itself. Sometimes the person engages in perverse or unnatural acts<br>like hanging (for bringing about his death). Through these causes the<br>living body of the creature dissolves away. Understand correctly the<br>manner as I declare it to thee.[13] Urged on by the Wind which becomes<br>violent, the heat in the body, becoming excited and reaching every part<br>of the body one after another, restrains all the (movements of the) vital<br>breaths. Know truly that excited all over the body, the heat becomes very<br>strong, and pierces every vital part where life may be said to reside. In<br>consequence of this, Jiva, feeling great pain, quickly takes leave of its<br>mortal casement. Know, O foremost of regenerate persons, that when the<br>vital parts of the physical organism become thus afflicted, Jiva slips<br>away from the body, overwhelmed with great pain. All living creatures are<br>repeatedly afflicted with birth and death. It is seen, O chief of<br>Brahmanas, that the pain which is felt by a person when casting off his<br>bodies is like what is felt by him when first entering the womb or when<br>issuing out of it. His joints become almost dislocated and he derives<br>much distress from the waters (of the womb).[14] Urged on by (another)<br>violent wind, the wind that is in the body becomes excited through cold,<br>and dissolves away the union of matter (called the body) into its<br>respective elements numbering five.[15] That wind which resides in the<br>vital breaths called Prana and Apana occurring within this compound of<br>the five primal elements, rushes upwards, from a situation of distress,<br>leaving the embodied creature. It is even thus that the wind leaves the<br>body. Then is seen breathlessness. The man then becomes destitute of<br>heat, of breath, of beauty, and of consciousness. Deserted by Brahman<br>(for Jiva is Brahman), the person is said to be dead. By those ducts<br>through which he perceives all sensuous objects, the bearer of the body<br>no longer perceives them. It is the eternal Jiva who creates in the body<br>in those very duets the life-breaths that are generated by food. The<br>elements gathered together become in certain parts firmly united. Know<br>that those parts are called the vitals of the body. It is said so in the<br>Sastras. When those vital parts are pierced, Jiva, rising up, enters the<br>heart of the living creature and restrains the principle of animation<br>without any delay. The creature then, though still endued with the<br>principle of consciousness, fails to know anything. The vital parts being<br>all overwhelmed, the knowledge of the living creature becomes overwhelmed<br>by darkness. Jiva then, who has been deprived of everything upon which to<br>stay, is then agitated by the wind. He then, deeply breathing a long and<br>painful breath, goes out quickly, causing the inanimate body to tremble.<br>Dissociated from the body, Jiva, however, is surrounded by his acts. He<br>becomes equipped on every side with all his auspicious acts of merit and<br>with all his sins. Brahmanas endued with knowledge and equipped with the<br>certain conclusions of the scriptures, know him, from indications, as to<br>whether he is possessed of merit or with its reverse. Even as men<br>possessed of eyes behold the fire-fly appearing and disappearing amid<br>darkness, men possessed of the eye of knowledge and crowned with success<br>of penances, behold, with spiritual vision, Jiva as he leaves the body,<br>as he is reborn, and as he enters the womb. It is seen that Jiva has<br>three regions assigned to him eternally. This world where creatures dwell<br>is called the field of action. Accomplishing acts good or bad, all<br>embodied creatures attain to the fruits thereof. In consequence of their<br>own acts, creatures acquire even here superior or inferior enjoyments.<br>Doers of evil deeds here, in consequence of those acts of theirs, attain<br>to Hell. This condition of sinking with head downwards, in which<br>creatures are cooked, is one of great misery. It is such that a rescue<br>therefrom is exceedingly difficult. Indeed; one should strive hard for<br>saving oneself from this misery. Those regions where creatures dwell when<br>they ascend from this world I shall now declare truly. Do thou listen to<br>me with attention. By listening to what I say, thou shalt attain to<br>firmness of understanding and a clear apprehension of (good and bad)<br>acts. Know that even those are the regions of all creatures of righteous<br>deeds, viz., the stellar worlds that shine in the firmament, the lunar<br>disc, and the solar disc as well that shines in the universe in its own<br>light. Upon the exhaustion, again, of their merits, they fall away from<br>those regions repeatedly. There, in Heaven itself, is distinction of<br>inferior, superior, and middling felicity. There, in Heaven itself, is<br>discontent at sight of prosperity more blazing than one's own. Even these<br>are the goals which I have mentioned in detail. I shall, after this,<br>discourse to you on the attainment by Jiva of the condition of residence<br>in the womb. Do thou hear me, with concentrated attention, O regenerate<br>one, as I speak to thee!'
