                            "Brahmana said, 'The wheel of life moves on. It has the understanding for<br>its strength; the mind for the pole (on which it rests); the group of<br>senses for its bonds, the (five) great elements for its nave, and home<br>for its circumference.[132] It is overwhelmed by decrepitude and grief,<br>and it has diseases and calamities for its progeny. That wheel relates in<br>time and place. It has toil and exercise for its noise. Day and Night are<br>the rotations of that wheel. It is encircled by heat and cold. Pleasure<br>and pain fire its joints, and hunger and thirst are the nails fixed into<br>it. Sun-shine and shade are the ruts (it causes). It is capable of being<br>agitated during even such a short space of time as is taken up by the<br>opening and the closing of the eyelid. It is enveloped in the terrible<br>waters of delusion. It is ever revolving and void of consciousness. It is<br>measured by months and half-months. It is not uniform (being<br>ever-changing), and moves through all the worlds. Penances and vows are<br>its mud. Passion's force is its mover. It is illuminated by the great<br>egoism, and is sustained by the qualities. Vexations (caused by the<br>non-acquisition of what is desired) are the fastenings that bind it<br>around. It revolves in the midst of grief and destruction. It is endued<br>with actions and the instruments of action. It is large and is extended<br>by attachments. It is rendered unsteady by cupidity and desire. It is<br>produced by variegated Ignorance. It is attended upon by fear and<br>delusion, and is the cause of the delusion of all beings. It moves<br>towards joy and pleasure, and has desire and wrath for its possession. It<br>is made up of entities beginning with Mahat and ending with the gross<br>elements. It is characterised by production and destruction going on<br>ceaselessly. Its speed is like that of the mind, and it has the mind for<br>its boundary.[133] This wheel of life that is associated with pairs of<br>opposites and devoid of consciousness, the universe with the very<br>immortals should cast away, abridge, and check. That man who always<br>understands accurately the motion and stoppage of this wheel of life, is<br>never seen to be deluded, among all creatures. Freed from all<br>impressions, divested of all pairs of opposites, released from all sins,<br>he attains to the highest goal. The householder, the Brahmacharin, the<br>forest recluse and the mendicant,&#8212;these four modes of life have all been<br>said to have the householder's mode for their foundation. Whatever system<br>of rules is prescribed in this world, their observance is beneficial.<br>Such observance has always been highly spoken of. He who has been first<br>cleansed by ceremonies, who has duly observed vows, who belongs in<br>respect of birth to a race possessed of high qualifications, and who<br>understands the Vedas, should return (from his preceptor's house).[134]<br>Always devoted to his wedded spouse, conducting himself after the manner<br>of the good, with his senses under subjugation, and full of faith, one<br>should in this world perform the five sacrifices. He who eats what<br>remains after feeding deities and guests, who is devoted to the<br>observance of Vedic rites, who duly performs according to his means<br>sacrifices and gifts, who is not unduly active with his hands and feet,<br>who is not unduly active with his eye, who is devoted to penances, who is<br>not unduly active with his speech and limits, comes under the category of<br>Sishta or the good. One should always bear the sacred thread, wear white<br>(clean) clothes, observe pure vows, and should always associate with good<br>men, making gifts and practising self-restraint. One should subjugate<br>one's lust and stomach, practise universal compassion, and be<br>characterised by behaviour that befits the good. One should bear a<br>bamboo-stick, and a water-pot filled with water. Having studied, one<br>should teach; likewise should also make sacrifices himself and officiate<br>at the sacrifices of others. One should also make gifts made to oneself.<br>Verily, one's conduct, should be characterised by these six acts. Know<br>that three of these acts should constitute the livelihood of the<br>Brahmanas, viz., teaching (pupils), officiating at the sacrifices of<br>others, and the acceptance of gifts from a person that is pure. As to the<br>other duties that remain, numbering three, viz., making of gifts, study,<br>and sacrifice, these are accompanied by merit.[135] Observant of<br>penances, self-restrained, practising universal compassion and<br>forgiveness, and looking upon all creatures with an equal eye, the man<br>that is conversant with duties should never be heedless with regard to<br>those three acts. The learned Brahmana of pure heart, who observes the<br>domestic mode of life and practises rigid vows, thus devoted and thus<br>discharging all duties to the best of his power, succeeds in conquering<br>Heaven.'"
