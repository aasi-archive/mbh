                            "Vaisampayana said, 'When the hour for initiation came, all those great<br>Ritwijas duly initiated the king in view of the horse-sacrifice. Having<br>finished the rites of binding the sacrificial animals, the son of Pandu,<br>viz., king Yudhishthira the just endued with great energy, the initiation<br>being over, shone with great splendour along with those Ritwijas. The<br>horse that was brought for the horse-sacrifice was let loose, agreeably<br>to the injunctions of the scriptures, that utterer of Brahma, viz., Vyasa<br>himself of immeasurable energy. The king Yudhishthira the just, O<br>monarch, after his initiation, adorned with a garland of gold around his<br>neck, shone in beauty like a blazing fire. Having a black deer skin for<br>his upper garment, bearing a staff in hand, and wearing a cloth of red<br>silk, the son of Dharma, possessed of great splendour, shone like a<br>second Prajapati seated on the sacrificial altar. All his Ritwijas also,<br>O king, were clad in similar robes. Arjuna also shone like a blazing<br>fire. Dhananjaya, unto whose car were yoked white steeds, then duly<br>prepared, O king, to follow that horse of the complexion of a black deer,<br>at the command of Yudhishthira. Repeatedly drawing his bow, named<br>Gandiva, O king, and casing his hand in a fence made of iguana skin,<br>Arjuna, O monarch, prepared to follow that horse, O ruler of men, with a<br>cheerful heart. All Hastinapore, O king, with very children, came out at<br>that spot from desire of beholding Dhananjaya, that foremost of the Kurus<br>on the eve of his journey. So thick was the crowd of spectators that came<br>to behold the horse and the prince who was to follow it, that in<br>consequence of the pressure of bodies, it seemed a fire was created. Loud<br>was the noise that arose from that crowd of men who assembled together<br>for beholding Dhananjaya the son of Kunti, and it seemed to fill all the<br>points of the compass and the entire welkin. And they said,&#8212;'There goes<br>the son of Kunti, and there that horse of blazing beauty. Indeed, the<br>mighty-armed hero follows the horse, having armed himself with his<br>excellent bow.'&#8212;Even these were the words which Jishnu of noble<br>intelligence heard. The citizens also blessed him, saying,&#8212;'Let<br>blessings he thine! Go thou safely and come back, O Bharata.' Others, O<br>chief of men uttered these words&#8212;'So great is the press that we do not<br>see Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated<br>bow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from<br>thy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee. When he returns we shall behold<br>him, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna<br>repeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O<br>chief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in<br>all sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,<br>proceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the<br>hero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,<br>and many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O<br>monarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of<br>men, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with<br>the energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,<br>many great and wonderful battles were fought between Arjuna and many<br>kings. These I shall describe to thee. The horse, O king, roamed over the<br>whole Earth. Know, O monarch, that from the north it turned towards the<br>East. Grinding the kingdoms of many monarchs that excellent horse<br>wandered. And it was followed slowly by the great car-warrior Arjuna of<br>white steeds. Countless, O monarch, was the fete of Kshatriyas,&#8212;of kings<br>in myriads&#8212;who fought with Arjuna on that occasion, for having lost<br>their kinsmen on the geld of Kurukshetra. Innumerable Kiratas also, O<br>king, and Yavanas, all excellent bowmen, and diverse tribes of Mlechechas<br>too, who had been discomfited before (by the Pandavas on the field of<br>Kurukshetra), and many Aryan kings, possessed of soldiers and animals<br>endued with great alacrity, and all irresistible in fight encountered the<br>son of Pandu in battle. Thus occurred innumerable battles in diverse<br>countries, O monarch, between Arjuna and the rulers of diverse realms who<br>came to encounter him. I shall, O sinless king, narrate to thee those<br>battles only which raged with great fury and which were the principal<br>ones among all he fought.'"
