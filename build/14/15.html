                            Janamejaya said, 'O the best of regenerate beings, when the Pandavas had<br>reconquered and pacified their kingdom, what did the two warriors,<br>Vasudeva and Dhananjaya do?<br><br>Vaisampayana said, 'O lord of the earth, Vasudeva and Dhananjaya were<br>highly pleased when the Pandavas had succeeded in regaining and pacifying<br>their dominions, and they deported themselves with great satisfaction,<br>like unto Indra and his consort in the celestial regions, and amidst<br>picturesque woodland sceneries, and tablelands of mountains, and sacred<br>places of pilgrimage, and lakes and rivers, they travelled with great<br>pleasure like the two Aswins in the Nandana garden of Indra. And, O<br>Bharata, the high-souled Krishna and the son of Pandu (Dhananjaya)<br>entering the beautiful hall of assembly at Indraprastha, whiled away<br>their time in great merriment. And there, O prince, they passed their<br>time in recounting the stirring incidents of the war, and the sufferings<br>of their past lives. And those two high-souled ancient sages, glad at<br>heart, recited the genealogy of the races of saints and gods. Then<br>Kesava, knowing the full import of all matters, addressed Partha in a<br>sweet and beautiful speech of excellent style and import. And then<br>Janarddana comforted the son of Pritha afflicted by the death of his<br>sons, and thousands of other relatives. And he of great ascetic merit and<br>knowing the science of all things having duly consoled him, Arjuna rested<br>for a while, as if a great burden had been removed from his own person.<br>Then Govinda (Krishna) consoling Arjuna with sweet speech addressed these<br>well-reasoned words to him.<br><br>Vasudeva said, 'O Arjuna, the terror of thine enemies, this whole earth<br>has been conquered by the king, the son of Dharma, relying on the power<br>of thy arms. And O the best of men, the virtuous king Yudhishthira now<br>enjoys the sovereignty of the earth without a rival, by the might of<br>Bhimasena and the twin brothers. O thou who knowest what virtue is, it<br>was by righteousness alone that the king has been able to regain his<br>kingdom free from all enemies (thorns), and it was by the action of<br>righteousness that king Suyodhana has been killed in battle, and, O son<br>of Pritha and pillar of the Kuru race, the wicked sons of Dhritarashtra,<br>avaricious, always rude in speech, and bent upon an unrighteous course of<br>conduct, having been exterminated with their followers, the king, the son<br>of Dharma and lord of the earth, now peaceably enjoys the entire kingdom<br>of the earth with thy aid, and I too, O son of Pandu, have been<br>pleasantly whiling away my time in thy company, amidst woodland scenes. O<br>terror of thine enemies, what more need I tell thee, but that where thou<br>and Pritha, and the king, the son of Dharma, and the mighty Bhimasena and<br>the two sons of Madri are, there am I attracted with exquisite delight. O<br>descendant of Kuru, in these delightful and sacred and heaven-like halls<br>of assembly a long time hath fleeted away in thy company without my<br>seeing Vasudeva, Valadeva and other leaders of the Vrishni race. And now<br>I am desirous of repairing to the city of Dwaravati. Do thou therefore, O<br>most valorous of men, assent to my departure. When king Yudhishthira was<br>smitten heavily with affliction, I with Bhishma, have recited to him many<br>appropriate legends suited to the occasion with a view of assuaging his<br>grief, and the pliant and high-minded Yudhishthira, though our sovereign<br>and versed in all lore paid due heed to our words. That son of Dharma<br>honours truth, and is grateful and righteous, therefore will his virtue<br>and good sense and the stability of his power always endure. And now, O<br>Arjuna, if it pleases thee, do thou go to that high-minded prince and<br>tell him of my intention to depart from this place. For, O thou of mighty<br>arms, even if death cometh to me, I am unwilling to do anything that may<br>displease him, leaving alone my going to the city of Dwaravati. O son of<br>Pritha and descendant of Kuru, I now tell thee truly, desiring to do only<br>what is good and agreeable to thee, and there can be nothing equivocal in<br>it in any way, that the necessity for my staying here no longer exists,<br>because, O Arjuna, that monarch the son of Dhritarashtra bath been slain<br>with his armies and attendants, and the earth, my friend, with its girdle<br>of seas and its mountains and woods and forests, and the kingdom of the<br>Kuru king filled with various gems, have passed under the sway of that<br>wise son of Dharma. And O foremost prince of Bharata's race, may that<br>virtuous prince administer the entire kingdom of the earth in<br>righteousness, and with the respect and approbation of numerous<br>high-souled Siddhas, and having his praises always extolled by the court<br>heralds. Do thou, O chieftain of Kuru's race, accompany me to-day to the<br>presence of the king, the great aggrandiser of the Kuru race, and sound<br>him of my intended return to Dwaraka. As Yudhishthira the high-souled<br>king of the Kurus always commands my love and respect, I have, O son of<br>Pritha, placed this my body and all the wealth that I have in my house,<br>at his disposal. And O prince Partha (son of Pritha), when this earth has<br>come under thy sway and that of the worshipful Yudhishthira of excellent<br>character, there no longer remains any necessity for my staying here<br>except for my affection for thee. And O monarch, when the redoubtable<br>Arjuna had been thus accosted by the noble-hearted Janarddana, he,<br>showing all the honours due to him, sorrowfully replied by merely saying<br>'be it so.'
