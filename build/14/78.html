                            "Vaisampayana said, 'The irresistible wielder of Gandiva, addresst for<br>battle, stood immovable on the field like Himavat himself. The Saindhava<br>warriors, once more rallying, showered in great wrath repeated down-pours<br>of shifts on him. The mighty-armed hero, laughing at his foes, who had<br>once more rallied but who were on the point of death, addressed them in<br>these soft words,&#8212;'Do ye fight to the best of your power and do ye<br>endeavour to vanquish me. Do ye however, accomplish all necessary acts,<br>for a great danger awaits you all. See, I fight all of you, baffling your<br>clouds of arrows. Bent as you are on battle, tarry a little. I shall soon<br>quell your pride.' The wielder of Gandiva, having said these words in<br>wrath, recollected, however, the words, O Bharata, of his eldest brother.<br>Those words were,&#8212;'Thou shouldst not, O child, slay those Kshatriyas who<br>will come against thee for battle. They should, however, be vanquished by<br>thee. That foremost of men, Phalguna, had been thus addressed by king<br>Yudhishthira the just, of great soul. He, therefore, began to reflect in<br>this strain. 'Even thus was I commissioned by my brother. Warriors<br>advancing against me should not be slain. I must act in such a way as not<br>to falsify the words of king Yudhishthira the just.' Having arrived at<br>this conclusion, Phalguna, that foremost of men, then said unto those<br>Saindhavas who were all fierce in battle, these words:&#8212;'I say what is<br>for your benefit. Though staying before me. I do not wish to slay you. He<br>amongst you who will say unto me that he has been vanquished by me and<br>that he is mine, will be spared by me. Having heard these words of mine,<br>act towards me in that way which may best conduce to your benefit. By<br>acting in a different way you will place yourselves in a situation of<br>great fear and danger.' Having said these words unto those heroic<br>warriors the chief of the Kurus began to fight them. Arjuna was inflamed<br>with wrath. His foes, desirous of victory, were equally enraged. The<br>Saindhavas then, O king, shot hundreds and thousands of straight arrows<br>at the wielder of Gandiva. Dhananjaya, with his own whetted shafts, cut<br>off those arrows of sharp and terrible points, resembling snakes of<br>virulent poison, before they could come up to him. Having cut off those<br>sharp arrows equipt with Kanka feathers, Arjuna pierced each of the<br>warriors opposed to him with a whetted shaft. The Saindhava Kshatriyas,<br>recollecting that it was Dhananjaya who had slain their king Jayadratha,<br>then hurled at him darts and javelins with great force. The diadem-decked<br>Dhananjaya of great might baffled their intent by cutting off all those<br>weapons before any of them could reach him. At length the son of Pandu<br>became highly angry. With many straight and broad-headed arrows, he<br>felled the heads of many of those warriors who were rushing at him from<br>desire of victory. Many fled, many rushed at Arjuna; many moved not, all<br>of them, however, uttered such aloud noise (of wrath and grief) that it<br>resembled the roar of the ocean. As they were slain by Partha of<br>immeasurable might, they fought him, each according to his strength and<br>prowess. Their animals being all exhausted, Partha succeeded in depriving<br>a large number of those warriors of their senses by means of his sharpest<br>shafts in that battle. Then Dussala, their queen, the daughter of<br>Dhritarashtra, knowing that they were rendered cheerless by Arjuna, took<br>her grandson in her arms and repaired to Arjuna. The child was the son of<br>Suratha (the son of Jayadratha). The brave prince proceeded to his<br>maternal uncle on his car for the safety of all the Saindhava warriors.<br>The queen, arrived at the presence of Dhananjaya, began to weep in<br>sorrow. The puissant Dhananjaya, seeing her, cast off his bow. Abandoning<br>his bow, Partha duly received his sister and enquired of her as to what<br>he could do for her. The queen replied unto him, saying,&#8212;'O chief of the<br>Bharatas, this child is the son of thy sister's son. He salutes thee, O<br>Partha. Look at him, O foremost of men.' Thus addressed by her, Partha<br>enquired after his son (Suratha), saying&#8212;'Where is he?' Dussala then<br>answered him, saying,&#8212;'Burning with grief on account of the slaughter of<br>his sire, the heroic father of this child died in great affliction of<br>heart. Listen to me how he met with his death. 'O Dhananjaya, he had<br>heard before that his sire Jayadratha had been slain by thee, O sinless<br>one. Exceedingly afflicted with grief at this, and hearing of thy arrival<br>here as the follower and protector of the sacrificial horse, he at once<br>fell down and gave up his life-breaths. Verily, deeply afflicted with<br>grief as he was, as go on as he heard of thy arrival he gave up his life.<br>Seeing him prostrate on the Earth, O lord, I took his infant son with me<br>and have come to thee, desirous of thy protection.' Having said these<br>words, the daughter of Dhritarashtra began to lament in deep affliction.<br>Arjuna stood before her in great cheerlessness of heart. His face was<br>turned towards the Earth. The cheerless sister then said unto her<br>brother, who was equally cheerless, these words: 'Behold thy sister.<br>Behold the child of thy sister's son. O perpetuator of Kuru's race, O<br>thou that art fully conversant with every duty, it behoveth thee to show<br>mercy to this child, forgetting the Kuru prince (Duryodhana) and the<br>wicked Jayadratha. Even as that slayer of hostile heroes, Parikshit, has<br>been born of Abhimanyu, so has this mighty-armed child, my grandson,<br>sprung from Suratha. Taking him with me, O chief of men, I have come to<br>thee, desirous of the safety of all the warriors. Do thou listen to these<br>words of mine. This child of that wicked foe of thine hath now come to<br>thee, O mighty-armed hero. It behoveth thee, therefore to show mercy to<br>this infant. O chastiser of foes, this infant seeks to gratify thee by<br>bending his head. He solicits thee for peace. O mighty-armed hero, be<br>inclined to make peace. O thou that art conversant with every duty, be<br>thou gratified with the child whose friends and kinsmen have all been<br>slain and who himself knows nothing of what has happened. Do not yield to<br>wrath. Forgetting his disreputable and cruel grandfather, who offended<br>against thee so highly, it behoveth thee to show thy grace towards this<br>child.' Recollecting queen Gandhari and king Dhritarashtra, Dhananjaya,<br>afflicted with grief, addressed Dussala who had said so unto him, and<br>answered her, censuring Kshatriya practices the while. 'Fie on<br>Duryodhana, that mean wight, covetous of kingdom and full of vanity!<br>Alas, it was for him that all my kinsmen have been despatched by me to<br>the abode of Yama.' Having said so, Dhananjaya comforted his sister and<br>became inclined to make peace. Cheerfully he embraced her and then<br>dismissed her, telling her to return to her palace. Dussala bade all her<br>warriors desist from that great battle, and worshipping Partha, she of<br>beautiful face retraced her steps towards her abode. Having vanquished<br>those heroes, viz., the Saindhavas, thus, Dhananjaya began to follow that<br>steed which roved at its will. The heroic Arjuna duly followed that<br>sacrificial horse even as the divine wielder of Pinaka had in days of<br>yore followed the deer through the firmament.[193] The steed, at its<br>will, wandered through various realms one after another, enhancing the<br>feats of Arjuna. In course of time, O chief of men, the horse wandering<br>at its pleasure, at last arrived within the dominions of the ruler of<br>Manipura, followed by the son of Pandu.'"
