                            "The Brahmana said, 'In this connection, O blessed lady, is cited the<br>ancient story of what kind the institution is of the five sacrificing<br>priests. The learned know this to be a great principle that Prana and<br>Apana and Udana and Samana and Vyana are the five sacrificing priests.'"<br><br>"The Brahmana's wife said, 'That naturally there are seven sacrificing<br>priests is what was my former conviction. Let the great principle be<br>declared to 'me as to how, verily, the number is five of the sacrificing<br>priests.'"<br><br>'The Brahmana said, 'The wind nursed by Prana afterwards takes birth in<br>Apana. The wind nursed in Apana then becomes developed into Vyana. Nursed<br>by Vyana, the wind is then developed into Udana. Nursed in Udana, the<br>wind is then generated as Samana. Those good beings in days of yore asked<br>the first-born Grandsire, saying&#8212;Do thou say who amongst us is the<br>foremost. He (whom thou wilt indicate) will be our chief.'<br><br>"Brahmana said, 'He upon whose extinction all the life-breaths become<br>extinct in the bodies of living creatures, he upon whose moving they<br>move, is verily the foremost (among you). Do ye go where ye like.'<br><br>"Prana said, 'Upon my extinction all the life-breaths become extinct in<br>the bodies of living creatures. Upon my moving they once more move. I am<br>(therefore) the foremost. Behold, I go into extinction!'<br><br>"The Brahmana continued, 'Prana then became extinct and once more moved<br>about. Then Samana and Udana also, O blessed one, said these words&#8212;Thou<br>dost not dwell here, pervading all this, as we do. Thou art not the<br>foremost amongst us, O Prana. (Only) Apana is under thy dominion. Prana<br>then moved about, and unto him Apana spoke.'<br><br>"Apana said, 'When I become extinct, all the life-winds become extinct in<br>the bodies of living creatures. When I move about, they again move about.<br>I am, therefore, the foremost. Behold, I go into extinction!'<br><br>"The Brahmana continued, 'Unto Apana who said so, both Vyana and Udana<br>said&#8212;O Apana, thou art not the foremost. (Only) Prana is under thy<br>dominion. Then Apana began to move about. Vyana once more addressed him<br>saying, I am the foremost of all (the life-winds). Listen, for what<br>reason. When I become extinct, all the life-winds become extinct in the<br>bodies of living creatures. When I move about, they once more move about.<br>I am (therefore) the foremost. Behold, I go into extinction!'<br><br>"The Brahmana continued, 'Then Vyana went into extinction and once more<br>began to move about. At this, Prana and Apana and Udana and Samana<br>addressed him, saying, 'Thou art not the foremost among us, O Vyana!<br>(Only) Samana is under thy dominion&#8212;Vyana then began to move about and<br>Samana said unto him,&#8212;I am the foremost of you all. Listen, for what<br>reason. When I become extinct, all the life-winds become extinct in the<br>bodies of living creatures. When I begin to move about, they once more<br>move about. Hence, I am the foremost. Behold, I go into extinction! Then<br>Samana began to move about. Unto him Udana said, I am the foremost of all<br>the life-winds. Listen, for what reason. When I become extinct, all the<br>life-winds become extinct in the bodies of living creatures. When I move<br>about they once more move about. Hence, I am the foremost. Behold, I go<br>into extinction!&#8212;Then Udana, after having gone into extinction, began<br>once more to move about, Prana and Apana and Samana and Vyana said, unto<br>him, O Udana, thou art not the foremost one among us, only Vyana is under<br>thy dominion.'<br><br>"The Brahmana continued, 'Unto them assembled together, the Lord of<br>creatures, Brahma, said, 'No one of you is superior to others. Ye are all<br>endued with particular attributes. All are foremost in their own spheres,<br>and all possess special attributes. Thus said unto them, that were<br>assembled together, the Lord of all creatures. There is one that is<br>unmoving, and one that is moving. In consequence of special attributes,<br>there are five life-winds. My own self is one. That one accumulates into<br>many forms. Becoming friendly unto one another, and gratifying one<br>another, depart in peace. Blessings to ye, do ye uphold one another!'"
