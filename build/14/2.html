                            "Vaisampayana said, "Thus addressed by the intelligent king Dhritarashtra<br>Yudhishthira, possessed of understanding, became calm. And then Kesava<br>(Krishna) accosted him,&#8212;'If a person indulges excessively in sorrow for<br>his departed forefathers, he grieves them. (Therefore, banishing grief),<br>do thou (now) celebrate many a sacrifice with suitable presents to the<br>priests; and do thou gratify the gods with Soma liquor, and the manes of<br>thy forefathers with their due food and drink. Do thou also gratify thy<br>guests with meat and drink and the destitute with gifts commensurate with<br>their desires. A person of thy high intelligence should not bear himself<br>thus. What ought to be known hath been known by thee; what ought to be<br>done, hath also been performed. And thou hast heard the duties of the<br>Kshatriyas, recited by Bhishma, the son of Bhagirathi, by Krishna<br>Dwaipayana, Narada and Vidura. Therefore thou shouldst not walk the way<br>of the stupid; but pursuing the course of thy forefathers, sustain the<br>burthen (of the empire). It is meet that a Kshatriya should attain heaven<br>for certain by his (own) renown. Of heroes, those that came to be slain<br>never shall have to turn away (from the celestial regions). Renounce thy<br>grief, O mighty sovereign. Verily, what hath happened was destined to<br>happen so. Thou canst in no wise see those that have been slain in this<br>war.&#8212;Having said this unto Yudhishthira, prince of the pious, the<br>high-spirited Govinda paused; and Yudhishthira answered him thus, 'O<br>Govinda, full well do I know thy fondness for me. Thou hast ever favoured<br>me with thy love and thy friendship. And, O holder of the mace and the<br>discus. O scion of Yadu's race, O glorious one, if (now) with a pleased<br>mind thou dost permit me to go to the ascetic's retreat in the woods,<br>then thou wouldst compass what is highly desired by me. Peace find I none<br>after having slain my grand-father, and that foremost of men, Karna, who<br>never fled from the field of battle. Do thou, O Janarddana, so order that<br>I may be freed from this heinous sin and that my mind may be purified. As<br>Pritha's son was speaking thus, the highly-energetic Vyasa, cognisant of<br>the duties of life, soothing him, spoke these excellent words, My child,<br>thy mind is not yet calmed; and therefore thou art again stupefied by a<br>childish sentiment. And wherefore, O child, do we over and over again<br>scatter our speech to the winds? Thou knowest duties of the Kshatriyas,<br>who live by warfare. A king that hath performed his proper part should<br>not suffer himself to be overwhelmed by sorrow. Thou hast faithfully<br>listened to the entire doctrine of salvation; and I have repeatedly<br>removed thy misgivings arising out of desire. But not paying due heed to<br>what I have unfolded, thou of perverse understanding hast doubtless<br>forgotten it clean. Be it not so. Such ignorance is not worthy of thee. O<br>sinless one, thou knowest all kinds, of expiation; and thou hast also<br>heard of the virtues of kings as well as the merits of gifts. Wherefore<br>then, O Bharata, acquainted with every morality and versed in all the<br>Agamas, art thou overwhelmed (with grief) as if from ignorance?'"
