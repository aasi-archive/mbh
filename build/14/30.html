                            "The Pitris said, 'In this connection is cited this old history. Having<br>heard it, thou shouldst act according to it, O foremost of all regenerate<br>persons. There was a royal sage of the name Alarka endued with the<br>austerest of penances. He was conversant with all duties, truthful in<br>speech, of high soul, and exceedingly firm in his vows. Having, with his<br>bow, conquered the whole Earth extending to the seas, and thereby<br>achieved an exceedingly difficult feat, he set his mind on that which is<br>subtle. While sitting at the root of a tree, his thoughts, O thou of<br>great intelligence, abandoning all those great feats, turned towards that<br>which is subtle.'<br><br>"Alarka said, 'My mind has become strong. Having conquered the mind,<br>one's conquest becomes permanent. Though surrounded by foes, I shall<br>(henceforth) shoot my arrows at other objects. Since in consequence of<br>its unsteadiness, it sets all mortals to accomplish acts, I shall shoot<br>very sharp-pointed shafts at the mind.'<br><br>"The mind said, 'These arrows, O Alarka, will never pierce me through.<br>They will pierce only thy own vital parts, Thy vital parts being pierced,<br>thou shalt die. Do thou look out for other arrows with which to destroy<br>me.' Hearing these words and reflecting upon them, he said as follows.<br><br>"Alarka said, 'Smelling very many perfumes, the nose hankers after them<br>only. Hence I shall shoot whetted arrows at the nose.'<br><br>"The nose said, 'These arrows will never cross through me, O Alarka. They<br>will pierce only thy own vital parts, and thy vital parts being pierced,<br>thou shalt die. Do thou look for other arrows with which to destroy me.'<br><br>Hearing these words and reflecting upon them, he said as follows.<br><br>"Alarka said, This one (viz., the tongue), enjoying savoury tastes,<br>hankers after them only. Hence I shall shoot whetted shafts at the<br>tongue.'<br><br>"The tongue said, 'These arrows, O Alarka, will not cross through me.<br>They will only pierce thy own vital parts and thy vital parts being<br>pierced, thou shalt die. Do thou look for other arrows with which to<br>destroy me.' Hearing these words and reflecting upon them, he said as<br>follows.<br><br>"Alarka said, 'The skin, touching diverse objects of touch, hankers after<br>them only. Hence, I shall tear off the skin with diverse arrows equipt<br>with the feathers of the Kanka.'<br><br>"The skin said, 'These arrows will not, O Alarka, cross through me. They<br>will pierce thy own vital parts only, and thy vital parts being pierced,<br>thou shalt die. Do thou look for other arrows with which to destroy me.'<br>Hearing these words and reflecting on them, he said as follows.<br><br>"Alarka said, 'Hearing diverse sounds, (the ear) hankers after them only.<br>Hence, I shall shoot whetted shafts at the ear.'<br><br>"The ear said, 'These arrows will not, O Alarka, cross through me. They<br>will pierce thy own vital parts only, and thy vital parts being pierced,<br>thou shalt die. Do thou then look for other arrows with which to destroy<br>me.' Hearing these words and reflecting upon them, he said as follows.<br><br>"Alarka said, 'Seeing many colours, the eye hankers after them only.<br>Hence, I shall destroy the eye with sharp-pointed arrows.'<br><br>"The eye said. 'These arrows will not, O Alarka, cross through me at all.<br>They will pierce thy own vital parts only, and thy vital parts being<br>pierced, thou shalt die. Do thou then look for other arrows with which to<br>destroy me!' Hearing these words and reflecting upon them, he said as<br>follows.<br><br>"Alarka said, 'This (viz., the understanding) forms many determinations<br>with the aid of ratiocination. Hence, I shall shoot whetted arrows at the<br>understanding.'<br><br>"The understanding said, 'These arrows will not, O Alarka, cross through<br>me at all. They will pierce thy vital parts only, and thy vital parts<br>being pierced, thou shalt die. Do thou then look for other arrows with<br>which to destroy me!'<br><br>"The Brahmana continued, 'Then Alarka, employing himself, even there, on<br>penances difficult to perform and exceedingly austere, failed to obtain,<br>by the high power (of his penances) arrows for casting at these seven.<br>Endued with puissance, he then, with mind well concentrated, began to<br>reflect. Then O best of regenerate ones, Alarka, that foremost of<br>intelligent men, having reflected for a long time, failed to obtain<br>anything better than Yoga. Setting his mind on one object, he remained<br>perfectly still, engaged in Yoga.[83] Endued with energy, he quickly slew<br>all the senses with one arrow, having entered by Yoga into his soul and<br>thereby attained to the highest success. Filled with wonder, that royal<br>sage then sang this verse: Alas, it is a pity that we should have<br>accomplished all acts that are external! Alas, that we should have,<br>endued with the thirst for enjoyment, courted (the pleasures of)<br>sovereignty before now! I have learnt this afterwards. There is no<br>happiness that is higher than Yoga.&#8212;Do thou know this, O Rama. Cease to<br>slay the Kshatriyas. Do thou practise the austerest of penances. Thou<br>wilt then attain to what is good.&#8212;Thus addressed by his grandsires,<br>Jamadagni's son practised the austerest penances, and having practised<br>them, that highly blessed one attained to that success which is difficult<br>to reach.'"
