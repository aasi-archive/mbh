                            "Vaisampayana said, 'After the high-souled Vasudeva of great prowess had<br>finished his narration of the great battle of the Bharatas before his<br>sire, it was plain that that hero had passed over the slaughter of<br>Abhimanyu. The motive of the high-souled one was that his sire might not<br>hear what was highly unpleasant to him. Indeed, the intelligent Krishna<br>did not wish that his sire Vasudeva should, on hearing the dreadful<br>intelligence of the death of his daughter's son, be afflicted with sorrow<br>and grief. (His sister) Subhadra, noticing that the slaughter of her son<br>had not been mentioned, addressed her brother, saying,&#8212;Do thou narrate<br>the death of my son, O Krishna&#8212;and fell down on the earth (in a swoon).<br>Vasudeva beheld his daughter fallen on the ground. As soon as he saw<br>this, he also fell down, deprived of his senses by grief. (Regaining his<br>senses) Vasudeva, afflicted with grief at the death of his daughter's<br>son, O king, addressed Krishna, saying, 'O lotus-eyed one, thou art famed<br>on Earth for being truthful in speech. Why, however, O slayer of foes,<br>dost thou not tell me today of the death of my daughter's son? O puissant<br>one, tell me in detail of the slaughter of thy sister's son. Possessed of<br>eyes resembling thine, alas, how was he slain in battle by foes? Since my<br>heart does not from grief break into a hundred pieces, it seems, O thou<br>of the Vrishni's race, that it does not die with men when its hour does<br>not come. Oh, at the time of his fall, what words did he utter;<br>apostrophising his mother? O lotus-eyed one what did that darling of<br>mine, possessed of restless eyes, say unto me? I hope he has not been<br>slain by foes while retreating from battle with his back towards them? I<br>hope, O Govinda, that, his face did not become cheerless while fighting?<br>He was possessed, O Krishna, of mighty energy. From a spirit of<br>boyishness, that puissant hero, boasting (of his prowess) in my presence,<br>used to speak of his skill (in battle). I hope that boy does not lie on<br>the field, slain deceitfully by Drona and Karna and Kripa and others? Do<br>thou tell me this. That son of my daughter always used to challenge<br>Bhishma and that foremost of all mighty warriors, viz., Karna, in<br>battle.' Unto his sire who, from excess of grief, indulged in such<br>lamentations, Govinda, more afflicted than he answered in these words.<br>'His face did not become cheerless as he fought in the van of battle.<br>Fierce though that battle was, he did not turn his back upon it. Having<br>slain hundreds and thousands of kings of Earth, he was brought to grief<br>by Drona and Karna and at last succumbed to the son of Dussasana. If, O<br>lord, he had been encountered, one to one, without intermission, he was<br>incapable of being slain in battle by even the wielder of the<br>thunderbolt. When his sire Arjuna was withdrawn from the main body by the<br>Samsaptakas (who challenged to fight him separately), Abhimanyu was<br>surrounded by the enraged Kaurava heroes headed by Drona in battle. Then,<br>O sire, after he had slaughtered a very large number of foes in battle,<br>thy daughter's son at last succumbed to the son of Dussasana. Without<br>doubt, he has gone to Heaven. Kill this grief of thine, O thou of great<br>intelligence. They that are of cleansed understandings never languish<br>when they meet with any calamity. He by whom Drona and Karna and others<br>were checked in battle,&#8212;heroes that were equal to Indra himself in<br>might&#8212;why would not he ascend to Heaven? O irresistible one, do thou<br>kill this grief of thine. Do not suffer thyself to be swayed by wrath.<br>That conqueror of hostile cities has attained in that sanctified goal<br>which depends upon death at the edge of weapons. After the fall of that<br>hero, this my sister Subhadra stricken with grief, indulged in loud<br>lamentations, when she saw Kunti, like a female ospray. When she met<br>Draupadi, she asked her in grief,&#8212;O reverend lady, where are all our<br>sons? I desire to behold them. Hearing her lamentations, all the Kaurava<br>ladies embraced her and wept sitting around her. Beholding (her<br>daughter-in-law) Uttara, she said,&#8212;'O blessed girl, where has thy<br>husband gone? When he comes back, do thou, without losing a moment,<br>apprise me of it. Alas, O daughter of Virata, as soon he heard my voice,<br>he used to come out of his chamber without the loss of a moment. Why does<br>not thy husband come out today? Alas, O Abhimanyu, thy maternal<br>uncles&#8212;mighty car-warriors&#8212;are all hale. They used to bless thee when<br>they saw thee come here prepared to go out for battle. Do thou tell me<br>the incidents of battle today as before, O chastiser of foes. Oh. why<br>dost thou not answer me today&#8212;me who am weeping so bitterly?'&#8212;Hearing<br>these lamentations of this daughter of the Vrishni race, Pritha, deeply<br>afflicted with grief, addressed her and slowly said,&#8212;'O Subhadra, though<br>protected by Vasudeva and Satyaki and by his own sire, thy youthful son<br>has yet been slain. That slaughter is due to the influence of Time! O<br>daughter of Yadu's race, mortal thy son was. Do not grieve. Irresistible<br>in battle, thy son has, without doubt, attained to the highest goal. Thou<br>art born in a high race of high-souled Kshatriyas. Do not grieve, O thou<br>of restless glances, O girl of eyes like lotus-petals. Do thou cast thy<br>eyes on Uttara who is quick with child. O blessed lady, do not yield to<br>sorrow. This auspicious girl will soon bring forth a son to that hero.<br>Having comforted her in this way, Kunti, conversant with every duty, O<br>perpetuator of Yadu's race, casting off her grief, O irresistible one,<br>made arrangements for Abhimanyu's obsequial rites, with the acquiescence<br>of king Yudhishthira and Bhima, and the twins (viz., Nakula and Sahadeva)<br>who in prowess resembled Yama himself. She also made many presents unto<br>the Brahmanas, and bestowed upon them many kine, O perpetuator of Yadu's<br>race, Then the Vrishni dame (Kunti), comforted a little, addressed the<br>daughter of Virata, saying,&#8212;O faultless daughter of Virata, thou<br>shouldst not indulge in grief. For the sake of thy husband, O thou of<br>rotund hips, protect the child in thy womb.&#8212;Having said these words, O<br>thou of great splendour, Kunti ceased. With her permission I have brought<br>Subhadra here. It was even thus, O giver of honours, that thy daughter's<br>son met with his death. Cast off thy burning grief, O irresistible one.<br>Indeed, do not set thy heart on sorrow.'
