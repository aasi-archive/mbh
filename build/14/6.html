                            "Vyasa said, 'The ancient legend of Vrihaspati and the wise Marutta is<br>cited in this connection. On hearing of the compact made by Angira's son<br>Vrihaspati with the lord of the gods (Indra), king Marutta made the<br>necessary preparations for a great sacrifice. The eloquent grandson of<br>Karandhama, (Marutta) having conceived the idea of a sacrifice in his<br>mind, went to Vrihaspati and addressed him thus, 'O worshipful ascetic, I<br>have intended to perform the sacrifice which thou didst propose to me<br>once on a previous occasion and in accordance with thy instructions, and<br>I now desire to appoint thee as officiating priest in this sacrifice, the<br>materials whereof have also been collected by me.&#8212;O excellent one, thou<br>art our family priest, therefore do thou take those sacrificial things<br>and perform the sacrifice thyself.'<br><br>Vrihaspati said, 'O lord of the earth, I do not desire to perform thy<br>sacrifice. I have been appointed as priest by the Lord of the gods<br>(Indra) and I have promised to him to act as such.'<br><br>Marutta said, 'Thou art our hereditary family priest, and for this reason<br>I entertain great regard for thee, and I have acquired the right of being<br>assisted at sacrifices by thee, and therefore it is meet that thou<br>shouldst officiate as priest at my sacrifice.'<br><br>Vrihaspati said, 'Having, O Marutta, acted as priest to the Immortals,<br>how can I act as such to mortal men, and whether thou dost depart hence<br>or stay, I tell thee, I have ceased to act as priest to any but the<br>Immortals. O thou of mighty arms, I am unable to act as thy priest now.<br>And according to thy own desire, thou canst appoint any one as thy priest<br>who will perform thy sacrifice.'<br><br>Vyasa said, 'Thus told, king Marutta became confused with shame, and<br>while returning home with his mind oppressed by anxiety, he met Narada on<br>his way. And that monarch on seeing the divine Rishi Narada stood before<br>him with due salutation, with his hands clasped together. Then Narada<br>addressing him thus said,&#8212;O royal sage, thou seemest to be not<br>well-pleased in thy mind; is all well with thee? Where hast thou been, O<br>sinless one, and whence the cause of this thy mental disquietude? And, O<br>king, if there be no objection to thy telling it to me, do thou, O best<br>of kings, disclose (the cause of thy anxiety) to me, so that, O prince, I<br>may allay the disquietude of thy mind with all my efforts.'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by the great Rishi Narada, king<br>Marutta informed him of the rebuff he had received from his religious<br>preceptor.'<br><br>Marutta said, 'Seeking for a priest to officiate at my sacrifice, I went<br>to that priest of the Immortals, Vrihaspati, the son of Angira, but he<br>did not choose to accept my offer. Having met with this rebuff from him,<br>I have no desire to live any longer now, for by his abandoning me thus, I<br>have, O Narada, become contaminated with sin.'<br><br>Vyasa said, 'Thus told by that king, Narada, O mighty prince, made this<br>reply to him with words which seemed to revive that son of Avikshit.'<br><br>Narada said, 'The virtuous son of Angira, Samvarta by name is wandering<br>over all the quarters of the earth in a naked state to the wonder of all<br>creatures; do thou, O prince, go to him. If Vrihaspati does not desire to<br>officiate at thy sacrifice, the powerful Samvarta, if pleased with thee,<br>will perform thy sacrifice.'<br><br>Marutta said, 'I feel as if instilled with new life, by these thy words,<br>O Narada, but O the best of speakers, do thou tell me where I can find<br>Samvarta, and how I can remain by his side, and how I am to act so that<br>he may not abandon me, for I do not desire to live if I meet with a<br>rebuff from him also.'<br><br>Narada said, 'Desirous of seeing Maheswara, O prince, he wanders about at<br>his pleasure in the city of Varanasi, in the garb of a mad man. And<br>having reached the gate of that city, thou must place a dead body<br>somewhere near it, and the man who shall turn away on seeing the corpse,<br>do thou, O prince, know that man to be Samvarta, and knowing him, do thou<br>follow his footsteps wheresoever that powerful man chooses to go and<br>finding him (at length) in a lonely place thou must seek his protection<br>with thy hands clasped together in supplication to him. And if he<br>enquires of thee as to the person who has given thee the information<br>about his own self, do thou tell him that Narada has informed thee about<br>Samvarta. And if he should ask thee to follow me, thou must tell him<br>without any hesitation, that I have entered into the fire.'<br><br>Vyasa said, 'Having signified his assent to the proposal of Narada, that<br>royal sage after duly worshipping him, and taking his permission,<br>repaired to the city of Varanasi, and having reached there, that famous<br>prince did as he had been told, and remembering the words of Narada, he<br>placed a corpse at the gate of the city. And by coincidence, that<br>Brahmana also entered the gate of the city at the same time. Then on<br>beholding the corpse, he suddenly turned away. And on seeing him turn<br>back, that prince, the son of Avikshit followed his footsteps with his<br>hands clasped together, and with the object of receiving instruction from<br>him. And then finding him in a lonely place, Samvarta covered the king<br>with mud and ashes and phlegm and spittle. And though thus worried and<br>oppressed by Samvarta, the king followed that sage with his hands clasped<br>together in supplication and trying to appease him. At length overcome<br>with fatigue, and reaching the cool shade of a sacred fig tree with many<br>branches, Samvarta desisted from his course and sat himself to rest.'
