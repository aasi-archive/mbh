                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Entering the palace of the Pandavas the mighty-armed<br>prince saluted his grand-mother in soothing and sweet accents. Then queen<br>Chitrangada, and (Ulupi) the daughter of (the snake) Kauravya, together<br>approached Partha and Krishna with humility. They then met Subhadra and<br>the other ladies of the Kuru race with due formalities. Kunti gave them<br>many gems and costly things. Draupadi and Subhadra and the other ladies<br>of Kuru's race all made presents to them. The two ladies took up their<br>residence there, using costly beds and seats, treated with affection and<br>respect by Kunti herself from desire of doing what was agreeable to<br>Partha. King Vabhruvahana of great energy, duly honoured (by Kunti), then<br>met Dhritarashtra according to due rites. Repairing then to king<br>Yudhishthira and Bhima and the other Pandavas, the mighty prince of<br>Manipura saluted them all with humility. They all embraced him with great<br>affection and honoured him duly. And those mighty car-warriors highly<br>gratified with him, made large gifts of wealth unto him. The king of<br>Manipura then humbly approached Krishna, that hero armed with the discus<br>and the mace, like a second Pradyumna approaching his sire. Krishna gave<br>unto the king a very costly and excellent car adorned with gold and unto<br>which were yoked excellent steeds. Then king Yudhishthira the just, and<br>Bhima, and Phalguna, and the twins, each separately honoured him and made<br>costly presents unto him. On the third day, the sage Vyasa, the son of<br>Satyavati, that foremost of eloquent men, approaching Yudhishthira<br>said,&#8212;'From this day, O son of Kunti, do thou begin thy sacrifice. The<br>time for it has come. The moment for commencing the rite is at hand. The<br>priests are urging thee. Let the sacrifice be performed in such a way<br>that no limb may become defective. In consequence of the very large<br>quantity of gold that is required for this sacrifice, it has come to be<br>called the sacrifice of profuse gold. Do thou also, O great king, make<br>the Dakshina of this sacrifice three times of what is enjoined. Let the<br>merit of thy sacrifice increase threefold. The Brahmanas are competent<br>for the purpose.[205] Attaining to the merits then of three<br>Horse-sacrifices, each with profuse presents, thou shalt be freed, O<br>king, from the sin of having slain thy kinsmen. The bath that one<br>performs upon completion of the Horse-sacrifice, O monarch, is highly<br>cleansing and productive of the highest merit. That merit will be thine,<br>O king of Kuru's race. Thus addressed by Vyasa of immeasurable<br>intelligence, the righteous-souled Yudhishthira of great energy underwent<br>the Diksha for performance of the Horse-sacrifice.[206] The mighty-armed<br>monarch then performed the great Horse-sacrifice characterised by gifts<br>of food and presents in profusion and capable of fructifying every wish<br>and producing every merit. The priests, well conversant with the Vedas,<br>did every rite duly, moving about in all directions. They were all<br>well-trained, and possessed of omniscience. In nothing was there a<br>swerving from the ordinances and nothing was down improperly. Those<br>foremost of regenerate persons followed the procedure as laid down (in<br>the scriptures) and as it should be followed in those points about which<br>no directions are given.[207] Those best of regenerate ones, having first<br>performed the rite called Pravargya, otherwise called Dharma, then duly<br>went through the rite of Abhishava, O king.[208] Those foremost of<br>Soma-drinkers, O monarch, extracting the juice of the Soma, then<br>performed the Savana rite following the injunctions of the scriptures.<br>Among those that came to that sacrifice none could be seen who was<br>cheerless, none who was poor, none who was hungry, none who was plunged<br>into grief, and none that seemed to be vulgar. Bhimasena of mighty energy<br>at the command of the king, caused food to be ceaselessly distributed<br>among those that desired to eat. Following the injunctions of the<br>scriptures, priests, well-versed in sacrificial rites of every kind,<br>performed every day all the acts necessary to complete the great<br>sacrifice. Amongst the Sadasayas of king Yudhishthira of great<br>intelligence there was none who was not well conversant with the six<br>branches of (Vedic). learning. There was none among them that was not an<br>observer of vows, none that was not an Upadhyaya; none that was not well<br>versed in dialectical disputations. When the time came for erecting the<br>sacrificial stake, O chief of Bharata's race, six stakes were set up that<br>were made of Vilwa,[209] six that were made of Khadira, and six that were<br>made of Saravarnin. Two stakes were get up by the priests that were made<br>of Devadaru in that sacrifice of the Kuru king, and one that was made of<br>Sleshmataka. At the command of the king, Bhima caused some other stakes<br>to be set up, for the sake of beauty only, that were made of gold.<br>Adorned with fine cloths supplied by the royal sage, those stakes shone<br>there like Indra and the deities with the seven celestial Rishis standing<br>around them in Heaven. A number of golden bricks were made for<br>constructing therewith a Chayana. The Chayana made resembled in beauty<br>that which had been made for Daksha, the lord of creatures (on the<br>occasion of his great sacrifice). The Chayana measured eight and ten<br>cubits and four stories or lairs. A golden bird, of the shape of Garuda,<br>was then made, having three angles.[210] Following the injunctions of the<br>scriptures, the priests possessed of great learning then duly tied to the<br>stakes both animals and birds, assigning each to its particular<br>deity.[211] Bulls, possessed of such qualifications as are mentioned in<br>the scriptures, and aquatic animals were properly tied to the stakes<br>after the rites relating to the sacrificial fire had been performed. In<br>that sacrifice of the high-souled son of Kunti, three hundred animals<br>were tied to the stakes setup, including that foremost of steeds. That<br>sacrifice looked exceedingly beautiful as if adorned with the celestial<br>Rishis, with the Gandharvas singing in chorus and the diverse tribes of<br>Apsaras dancing in merriment. It teemed, besides, with Kimpurushas and<br>was adorned with Kinnaras. All around it were abodes of Brahmanas crowned<br>with ascetic success. There were daily seen the disciples of Vyasa, those<br>foremost of regenerate ones, who are compilers of all branches of<br>learning, and well conversant with sacrificial rites. There was Narada,<br>and there was Tumvuru of great splendour. There were Viswavasu and<br>Chitrasena and others, all of whom were proficient in music. At intervals<br>of the sacrificial rites, those Gandharvas, skilled in music and well<br>versed in dancing, used to gladden the Brahmanas who were engaged in the<br>sacrifice.'"
