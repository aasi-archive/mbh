                            "Vaisampayana said, 'The (sacrificial) steed, having wandered over the<br>whole Earth bounded by the ocean, then ceased and turned his face towards<br>the city called after the elephant. Following as he did that horse, the<br>diadem-decked Arjuna also turned his face towards the Kuru capital.<br>Wandering at his will, the steed then came to the city of Rajagriha.<br>Beholding him arrived within his dominion, O monarch, the heroic son of<br>Sahadeva, observant of Kshatriya duties, challenged him to battle. Coming<br>out of his city, Meghasandhi, mounted on his car and equipt with bow and<br>arrows and leathern fence, rushed towards Dhananjaya who was on foot.<br>Possessed of great energy, Meghasandhi approaching Dhananjaya, O king,<br>said these words from a spirit of childishness and without any skill.<br>'This steed of thine, O Bharata, seems to move about, protected by women<br>only. I shall take away the horse. Do thou strive to free him. Although<br>my sires did not teach thee in battle, I, however, shall do the duties of<br>hospitality to you. Do thou strike me, for I shall strike thee.' Thus<br>addressed, the son of Pandu, smiling the while, answered him, saying, 'To<br>resist him who obstructs me is the vow cast on me by my eldest brother.<br>Without doubt, O king, this is known to thee. Do thou strike me to the<br>best of thy power. I have no anger.' Thus addressed, the ruler of Magadha<br>first struck the son of Pandu, showering his arrows on him like the<br>thousand-eyed Indra showering heavy downpour of rain. Then, O chief of<br>Bharata's race, the heroic wielder of Gandiva, with shafts sped from his<br>excellent bow, baffled all the arrows shot carefully at him by his<br>antagonist. Having thus baffled that cloud of arrows, the ape-bannered<br>hero sped a number of blazing arrows at his foe that resembled snakes<br>with fiery mouths. These arrows he shot at his flag and flag-staff and<br>car and poles and yoke and the horses, sparing the body of his foe and<br>his car-driver. Though Partha who was capable of shooting the bow with<br>the left hand (as well as with the right) spared the body of the prince<br>of Magadha, yet the latter thinking that his body was protected by his<br>own prowess, shot many arrows at Partha. The wielder of Gandiva, deeply<br>struck by the prince of Magadha, shone like a flowering Palasa (Butea<br>frondosa) in the season of spring. Arjuna had no desire of slaying the<br>prince of Magadha. It was for this that, having struck the son of Pandu,<br>he succeeded in remaining before that foremost of heroes. Then<br>Dhananjaya, becoming angry, drew his bow with great force, and slew his<br>antagonist's steeds and then struck off the head of his car-driver. With<br>a razor-headed shaft he then cut off Meghasandhi's large and beautiful<br>bow, and then his leathern fence. Then cutting off his flag and<br>flag-staff, he caused it to fall down. The prince of Magadha, exceedingly<br>afflicted, and deprived of his steeds and bow and driver, took up a mace<br>and rushed with great speed at the son of Kunti. Arjuna then with many<br>shafts of his equipt with vulturine feathers cut off into fragments, that<br>mace of his advancing foe which was adorned with bright gold. Thus cut<br>off into fragments, that mace with its begemmed bonds and knots all<br>severed, fell on the Earth like a she-snake helplessly hurled down by<br>somebody. When his foe became deprived of his car, his bow, and his mace,<br>that foremost of warriors, viz., the intelligent Arjuna, did not wish to<br>strike him. The ape-bannered hero then, comforting his cheerless foe who<br>had been observant of Kshatriya duties, said unto him these words, 'O<br>son, thou hast sufficiently displayed thy adherence to Kshatriya duties.<br>Go now. Great have been the feats, O king, which thou hast accomplished<br>in battle although thou art very young in years. The command I received<br>from Yudhishthira was that kings who oppose me should not be slain. It is<br>for this thou livest yet, O monarch, although thou hast offended me in<br>battle. Thus addressed, the ruler of Magadha considered himself<br>vanquished and spared. Thinking then that it was his duty to do so, he<br>approached Arjuna and joining his hands in reverence worshipped him. And<br>he said, 'Vanquished have I been by thee. Blessed be thou, I do not<br>venture to continue the battle. Tell me what I am to do now for thee.<br>Regard thy behest as already accomplished. Comforting him again, Arjuna<br>once more said unto him, 'Thou shouldst repair to the Horse-sacrifice of<br>our king which takes place at the coming full moon of Chaitra.' Thus<br>addressed by him, the son of Sahadeva said, 'So be it,'&#8212;and then duly<br>worshipped that horse as also Phalguna, that foremost of warriors. The<br>sacrificial horse then, equipt with beautiful manes, proceeded at his<br>will along the sea-coast, repairing to the countries of the Bangas, the<br>Pundras, and the Kosalas. In those realms Dhananjaya, with his bow<br>Gandiva, O king, vanquished innumerable Mlechecha armies one after<br>another.'"
