                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I have heard, O Krishna, thy agreeable words. They<br>are such as deserve to be spoken by thee. Gladsome and sweet as nectar<br>are they, indeed, they fill my heart with great pleasure, O puissant one.<br>O Hrishikesa, I have heard that innumerable have been the battles which<br>Vijaya has fought with the kings of the Earth. For what reason is Partha<br>always dissociated from ease and comfort? Vijaya is exceedingly<br>intelligent. This, therefore, pains my heart very much. I always, O<br>Janarddana, think, when I am withdrawn from business, of Kunti's son<br>Jishnu. The lot of that delighter of the Pandus is exceedingly miserable.<br>His body has every auspicious mark. What, however, O Krishna, is that<br>sign in his excellent body in consequence of which he has always to<br>endure misery and discomfort? That son of Kunti has to bear an<br>exceedingly large share of unhappiness. I do not see any censurable<br>indication in his body. It behoves thee to explain the cause to me it I<br>deserve to hear it. Thus addressed, Hrishikesa, that enhancer of the<br>glory of the Bhoja princes, having reflected for a long time, answered as<br>follows&#8212;'I do not see any censurable feature in this prince, except that<br>the cheek bones of this lion among men are a little too high. It is in<br>consequence of this that that foremost of men has always to be on the<br>road. I really do not see anything else in consequence of which he could<br>be made so unhappy.' Thus answered by Krishna of great intelligence, that<br>foremost of men, viz., king Yudhishthira, said unto the chief of the<br>Vrishnis that it was even so. The princess Draupadi, however, looked<br>angrily and askance at Krishna, (for she could not bear the ascription of<br>any fault to Arjuna). The slayer of Kesi, viz., Hrishikesa, approved of<br>that indication of love (for his friend) which the princess of Panchala,<br>who also was his friend, displayed.[204] Bhimasena and the other Kurus,<br>including the sacrificial priests, who heard of the agreeable triumphs of<br>Arjuna in course of his following the horse, became highly gratified.<br>While they were still engaged in discoursing on Arjuna, an envoy came<br>from that high-souled hero bearing a message from him. Repairing to the<br>presence of the Kuru king, the intelligent envoy bowed his head in<br>reverence and informed him of the arrival of that foremost of men, viz.,<br>Phalguna. On receipt of this intelligence, tears of joy covered the<br>king's eyes. Large gifts were made to the messenger for the very<br>agreeable tidings he had brought. On the second day from that date, a<br>loud din was heard when that foremost of men, that chief of the Kurus,<br>came. The dust raised by the hoofs of that horse as it walked in close<br>adjacence to Arjuna, looked as beautiful as that raised by the celestial<br>steed Uchchaisravas. And as Arjuna advanced he heard many gladdening<br>words uttered by the citizens. 'By good luck, O Partha, thou art out of<br>danger. Praise to you and king Yudhishthira! Who else than Arjuna could<br>come back after having caused the horse to wander over the whole Earth<br>and after having vanquished all the kings in battle? We have not heard of<br>such a feat having been achieved by even Sagara and other high-souled<br>kings of antiquity. Future kings also will never be able to accomplish so<br>difficult a feat, O foremost one of Kuru's race, as this which thou hast<br>achieved.' Listening to such words, agreeable to the ear, of the<br>citizens, the righteous-souled Phalguna entered the sacrificial compound.<br>Then king Yudhishthira with all his ministers, and Krishna, the delighter<br>of the Yadus, placing Dhritarashtra in their van, went out for receiving<br>Dhananjaya. Saluting the feet of his sire (Dhritarashtra), and then of<br>king Yudhishthira the just of great wisdom, and then worshipping Bhima<br>and others, he embraced Kesava. Worshipped by them all and worshipping<br>them in return according to due rites, the mighty-armed hero, accompanied<br>by those princes, took rest like a ship-wrecked man tossed on the waves<br>resting on reaching the shore. Meanwhile king Vabhruvahan of great<br>wisdom, accompanied by his mothers (Chitrangada and Ulupi), came to the<br>Kuru capital. The mighty-armed prince duly saluted all his seniors of<br>Kuru's race and the other kings present there, and was honoured by them<br>all in return. He then entered the excellent abode of his grand-mother<br>Kunti."'
