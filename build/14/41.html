                            "Brahmana said, 'That Mahat who was first produced is called Egoism. When<br>it sprang up as I, it came to be called as the second creation. That<br>Egoism is said to be the source of all creatures, for these have sprung<br>from its modifications. It is pure effulgence and is the supporter of<br>consciousness. It is Prajapati. It is a deity, the creator of deities,<br>and of mind. It is that which creates the three worlds. It is said to be<br>that which feels&#8212;I am all this.&#8212;That is the eternal world existing for<br>those sages who are contented with knowledge relating to the soul, who<br>have meditated on the soul, and who have won success by Vedic study and<br>sacrifices. By consciousness of soul one enjoys the qualities. That<br>source of all creatures, that creator of all creatures, creates (all<br>creatures) even in this way. It is that which causes all changes. It is<br>that which causes all beings to move. By its own light it illuminates the<br>universe likewise.'"
