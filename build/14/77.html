                            "Vaisampayana said, 'There occurred a great battle between the<br>diadem-decked Arjuna and the hundreds of Saindhavas who still lived after<br>the slaughter of their clan (on the field of Kurukshetra). Hearing that<br>he of white steeds had entered their territories, those Kshatriyas came<br>out against him, unable to bear that foremost one of Pandu's race. Those<br>warriors who were as terrible as virulent poison, finding the horse<br>within their dominion, seized it without being inspired with any fear of<br>Partha who was the younger brother of Bhimasena. Advancing against<br>Vibhatsu who waited on foot, armed with his bow, upon the sacrificial<br>steed, they assailed him from a near point. Defeated in battle before,<br>those Kshatriyas of mighty energy, impelled by the desire of victory,<br>surrounded that foremost of men. Proclaiming their names and families and<br>their diverse feats, they showered their arrows on Partha. Pouring<br>showers of arrows of such fierce energy as were capable of impeding the<br>course of hostile elephants, those heroes surrounded the son of Kunti,<br>desirous of vanquishing him in battle. Themselves seated on cars, they<br>fought Arjuna of fierce feats who was, on foot. From every side they<br>began to strike that hero, that slayer of the Nivatakavachas, that<br>destroyer of the Samasaptakas, that killer of the king of the Sindhus.<br>Surrounding him on every side as within a cage by means of a thousand<br>cars and ten thousand horses, those brave warriors expressed their<br>exaltation. Recollecting the slaughter by Dhananjaya of Jayadratha in<br>battle, O thou of Kuru's race, they poured heavy showers of arrows on<br>that hero like a mass of clouds showering a heavy downpour. Over-whelmed<br>with that arrowy shower, Arjuna looked like the sun covered by a cloud.<br>That foremost son of Pandu, in the midst of that cloud of arrows,<br>resembled a bird in the midst of an iron cage, O Bharata. Seeing the son<br>of Kunti thus afflicted with shafts, cries of Oh and Alas were uttered by<br>the three worlds and the Sun himself became shorn of his splendour. Then,<br>O king, a terrible wind began to blow, and Rahu swallowed up both the Sun<br>and the Moon at the same time. Many meteors struck the solar disc and<br>then shot in different directions. The prince of mountains, viz.,<br>Kailasa, began to tremble. The seven (celestial) Rishis, as also the<br>other Rishis of Heaven, penetrated with fear, and afflicted with grief<br>and sorrow, breathed hot sighs. Piercing through the welkin, those<br>meteors fell on the lunar disc as well. All the points of the compass<br>became filled with smoke and assumed a strange aspect. Reddish clouds,<br>with flashes of lightning playing in their midst and the bow of Indra<br>measuring them from side to side, suddenly covered the welkin and poured<br>flesh and bloods on the Earth. Even such was the aspect which all nature<br>assumed when that hero was overwhelmed with showers of shafts. Indeed,<br>when Phalguna, that foremost one among the Bharatas, was thus afflicted,<br>those marvels were seen. Overwhelmed by that dense cloud of arrows,<br>Arjuna became stupefied. His bow, Gandiva, fell down from his relaxed<br>grip and his leathern fence also slipped down. When Dhananjaya became<br>stupefied, the Saindhava warriors once more shot at that senseless<br>warrior, without loss of time, innumerable other shafts. Understanding<br>that the son of Pritha was deprived of consciousness, the deities, with<br>hearts penetrated by fear, began to seek his welfare by uttering diverse<br>benedictions. Then the celestial Rishis, the seven Rishis, and the<br>regenerate Rishis, became engaged in silent recitations from desire of<br>giving victory to Pritha's son of great intelligence. When at last the<br>energy of Partha blazed forth through those acts of the denizens of<br>Heaven, that hero, who was conversant with celestial weapons of high<br>efficacy, stood immovable like a hill. The delighter of the Kurus then<br>drew his celestial bow. And as he repeatedly stretched the bowstring, the<br>twang that followed resembled the loud sound of some mighty machine. Like<br>Purandara pouring rain, the puissant Arjuna then, with that bow of his,<br>poured incessant showers of shafts on his foes. Pierced by those shafts<br>the Saindhava warriors with their chiefs became invisible like trees when<br>covered with locusts. They were frightened at the very sound of Gandiva,<br>and afflicted by fear they fled away. In grief of heart they shed tears<br>and uttered loud lamentations. The mighty warrior moved amidst that host<br>of foes with the celerity of a fiery wheel, all the time piercing those<br>warriors with his arrows. Like the great Indra, the wielder of the<br>thunder-bolt, that slayer of foes, viz., Arjuna, shot from his bow in<br>every direction that shower of arrows which resembled a sight produced by<br>magic (instead of any human agency). The Kaurava hero, piercing the<br>hostile host with showers of arrows, looked resplendent like the autumnal<br>Sun when he disperses the clouds with his powerful rays.'"
