                            "The Brahmana said, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative, O<br>lady, of the discourse between a Brahmana and (king) Janaka. King Janaka<br>(on a certain occasion), desirous of punishing him, said unto a Brahmana<br>who had become guilty of some offence, 'Thou shalt not dwell within my<br>dominions.' Thus addressed, the Brahmana replied unto that best of kings,<br>saying, 'Tell me, O king, what the limits are of the territories subject<br>to thee. I desire, O lord, to dwell within the dominions of another king.<br>Verily, I wish to obey thy behest, O lord of Earth, agreeably to the<br>scriptures.&#8212;Thus addressed by that celebrated Brahmana, the king,<br>hearing repeated and hot sighs, said not a word in reply. Like the planet<br>Rahu overwhelming the Sun, a cloudedness of understanding suddenly<br>overwhelmed that king of immeasurable energy as he sat plunged in<br>thought. When that cloudedness of understanding passed away and the king<br>became comforted, he spoke after a short while these words unto that<br>Brahmana.'<br><br>"Janaka said, 'Although a (large) inhabited tract is subject to me within<br>this ancestral kingdom of mine, yet I fail to find my dominion, searching<br>through the whole Earth. When I failed to find it on the Earth, I then<br>searched Mithila (for it). When I failed to find it in Mithila, I then<br>searched for it among my own children. When I failed to find it even<br>there, a cloudedness of understanding came over me. After that<br>cloudedness of understanding passed away, intelligence came back to me.<br>Then I thought that I have no dominion, or that everything is my<br>dominion. Even this body is not mine, or the whole Earth is mine. At the<br>same time, O best of regenerate persons, I think that that is as much<br>mine as it is of others. Do thou, therefore, dwell (here) as long as thy<br>choice leads thee, and do thou enjoy as long as thou pleasest.'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'When there is a large inhabited tract in thy<br>ancestral kingdom, tell me, depending upon what understanding, has the<br>idea of meum been got rid of by thee. What also is that understanding<br>depending upon which thou hast come to the conclusion that everything<br>constitutes thy dominion? What, indeed, is the notion through which thou<br>hast no dominion, or everything is thy dominion?'<br><br>"Janaka said, 'All conditions here, in all affairs, have been understood<br>by me to be terminable. Hence, I could not find that which should be<br>called mine.[88] (Considering) whose is this, I thought of the Vedic text<br>about anybody's property, I could not, therefore, find, by my<br>understanding, what should be (called) mine.[89] Depending upon this<br>notion, I got rid of idea of mineness. Hear now what that notion is<br>depending upon which I came to the conclusion that I have dominion<br>everywhere. I do not desire for my own self those smells that are even in<br>my nose. Therefore, the earth, subjugated by me, is always subject to<br>me.[90] I do not desire for my own self those tastes that exist in<br>contact with even my tongue. Therefore, water, subjugated by me, is<br>always subject to me. I do not desire for my own self the colour or light<br>that appertains to my eye. Therefore, light subjugated by me, is always<br>subject to me. I do not desire for my own self those sensations of touch<br>which are in contact with even my skin. Therefore, the wind, subjugated<br>by me, is always subject to me. I do not desire for my own self those<br>sounds which are in contact with even my ear. Therefore sounds,<br>subjugated by me, are always subject to me. I do not desire for my own<br>self the mind that is always in my mind. Therefore the mind, subjugated<br>by me, is subject to me. All these acts of mine are for the sake of the<br>deities, the Pitris, the Bhutas, together with guests.[91]&#8212;The Brahmana<br>then, smiling, once more said unto Janaka,&#8212;Know that I am Dharma, who<br>have come here today for examining thee. Thou art verily the one person<br>for setting this wheel in motion, this wheel that has the quality of<br>Goodness for its circumference, Brahmin for its nave, and the<br>understanding for its spokes, and which never turns back!'"[92]
