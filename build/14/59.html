                            "Janamejaya said, 'After having conferred that boon on Utanka, O foremost<br>of regenerate persons, what did the mighty-armed Govinda of great<br>celebrity next do?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Having granted that boon to Utanka, Govinda,<br>accompanied by Satyaki, proceeded to Dwaraka on his car drawn by his<br>large steeds endued with great speed. Passing many lakes and rivers and<br>forests and hills, he at last came upon the delightful city of Dwaravati.<br>It was at the time, O king, when the festival of Raivataka had begun,<br>that he of eyes like lotus-petals arrived with Satyaki as his companion.<br>Adorned with many beautiful things and covered with diverse Koshas made<br>of jewels and gems, the Raivataka hill shone, O king, with great<br>splendour. That high mountain, decked with excellent garlands of gold and<br>gay festoons of flowers, with many large trees that looked like the Kalpa<br>trees of Indra's garden, and with many golden poles on which were lighted<br>lamps, shone in beauty through day and night. By the caves and fountains<br>the light was so great that it seemed to be broad day. On all sides<br>beautiful flags waved on the air with little bells that jingled<br>continuously. The entire hill resounded with the melodious songs of men<br>and women. Raivataka presented a most charming prospect like Meru with<br>all his jewels and gems. Men and women, excited and filled with delight,<br>O Bharata, sang aloud. The swell of music that thus rose from that<br>foremost of mountains seemed to touch the very heavens. Everywhere were<br>heard spouts and loud whoops of men who were in all stages of excitement.<br>The cackle of thousands of voices made that mountain delightful and<br>charming. It was adorned with many shops and stalls filled with diverse<br>viands and enjoyable articles. There were heaps of cloths and garlands,<br>and the music of Vinas and flutes and Mridangas was heard everywhere.<br>Food mixed with wines of diverse kinds was stored here and there. Gifts<br>were being ceaselessly made to those that were distressed, or blind, or<br>helpless. In consequence of all this, the festival of that mountain<br>became highly auspicious. There were many sacred abodes built on the<br>breast of that mountain, O hero, within which resided many men of<br>righteous deeds. Even thus did the heroes of Vrishni's race sport in that<br>festival of Raivataka. Equipt with those mansions, that mountain shone<br>like a second Heaven. At the arrival of Krishna, O chief of Bharata's<br>race, that prince of mountains resembled the blessed abode of Indra<br>himself. Worshipped (by his relatives), Krishna then entered a beautiful<br>mansion. Satyaki also went to his own quarters with a delighted soul.<br>Govinda entered his residence after a long absence, having accomplished<br>feats of great difficulty like Vasava amid the Danava host. The heroes of<br>the Bhoja, Vrishni, and Andhaka races, all came forward to receive that<br>high-souled one like the deities advancing to receive him of a hundred<br>sacrifices. Endued with great intelligence, he honoured them in return<br>and enquired after their welfare. With a gratified heart he then saluted<br>his father and mother. The mighty-armed hero was embraced by both of them<br>and comforted too (by numerous evidences of affection). He then took his<br>seat with all the Vrishnis sitting around him. Having washed his feet and<br>dispelled his fatigue, Krishna of mighty energy, as he sat there, then<br>recounted the chief incidents of the great battle in answer to the<br>questions put to him by his sire.'"
