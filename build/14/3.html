                            "Vyasa said, 'O Yudhishthira, thy wisdom, I conceive, is not adequate.<br>None doth any act by virtue of his own power. It is God. who engageth him<br>in acts good or bad, O bestower of honour. Where then is the room for<br>repentance? Thou deemest thyself as having perpetrated impious acts. Do<br>thou, therefore, O Bharata, harken as to the way in which sin may be<br>removed. O Yudhishthira, those that commit sins, can always free<br>themselves from them through penance, sacrifice and gifts. O king, O<br>foremost of men, sinful people are purified by sacrifice, austerities and<br>charity. The high-souled celestials and Asuras perform sacrifices for<br>securing religious merit; and therefore sacrifice are of supreme<br>importance. It is through sacrifices that the high-souled celestials had<br>waxed so wondrously powerful; and having celebrated rites did they<br>vanquish the Danavas. Do thou, O Yudhishthira, prepare for the Rajasuya,<br>and the horse-sacrifice, as well as, O Bharata, for the Sarvamedha and<br>the Naramedha.[2] And then as Dasaratha's son, Rama, or as Dushmanta's<br>and Sakuntala's son, thy ancestor, the lord of the Earth, the exceedingly<br>puissant king Bharata, had done, do thou agreeably to the ordinance<br>celebrate the Horse-sacrifice with Dakshinas. Yudhishthira replied,<br>'Beyond a doubt, the Horse-sacrifice purifieth princes. But I have a<br>purpose of which it behoveth thee to hear. Having caused this huge<br>carnage of kindred, I cannot, O best of the regenerate ones, dispense<br>gifts even on a small scale; I have no wealth to give. Nor can I for<br>wealth solicit these juvenile sons of kings, staying in sorry plight,<br>with their wounds yet green, and undergoing suffering. How, O foremost of<br>twice-born ones, having myself destroyed the Earth can I, overcome by<br>sorrow, levy dues for celebrating a sacrifice? Through Duryodhana's<br>fault, O best of ascetics, the kings of the Earth have met with<br>destruction, and we have reaped ignominy. For wealth Duryodhana hath<br>wasted the Earth; and the treasury of that wicked-minded son of<br>Dhritarashtra is empty. (In this sacrifice), the Earth is the Dakshina;<br>this is the rule that is prescribed in the first instance. The usual<br>reversal of this rule, though sanctioned, is observed, by the learned as<br>such. Nor, O ascetic, do I like to have a substitute (for this process).<br>In this matter, O reverend sir, it behoveth thee to favour me with thy<br>counsel'. Thus addressed by Pritha's son, Krishna Dwaipayana, reflecting<br>for a while, spoke unto the righteous king,&#8212;'This treasury, (now)<br>exhausted, shall be full. O son of Pritha, in the mountain Himavat (The<br>Himalayas) there is gold which had been left behind by Brahmanas at the<br>sacrifice of the high-souled Marutta.'[3] Yudhishthira asked, 'How in<br>that sacrifice celebrated by Marutta was so much gold amassed? And, O<br>foremost of speakers, when did he reign?' Vyasa said 'If, O Pritha's son,<br>thou art anxious to hear concerning that king sprung from the Karandhama<br>race, then listen to me as I tell thee when that highly powerful monarch<br>possessed of immense wealth reigned.'"
