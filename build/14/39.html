                            "Brahmana said, 'The qualities are incapable of being declared as<br>completely separate from one another. Passion and Goodness and Darkness<br>are seen existing in a state of union. They are attached to one another.<br>They depend on one another. They have one another for their refuge. They<br>likewise follow one another. As long as goodness exists, so long does<br>Passion exist. There is no doubt in this. As long as Darkness and<br>Goodness exist, so long does Passion exist. They make their journey<br>together, in union, and moving collectively. They, verily, move in body,<br>when they act with cause or without cause. Of all these which act with<br>one another, however, much they may differ in their development, the<br>manner in which their increase and diminution take place will now be<br>declared. There where Darkness exists in an increased measure, in the<br>lower creatures (for example), Passion exists in a smaller measure and<br>Goodness in a measure that is still less. There where Passion exists in a<br>copious measure, in creatures of middle course, Darkness exists in a<br>smaller measure and Goodness in a measure that is still less. There where<br>Goodness exists in a copious measure, in creatures of upward courses,<br>Darkness should be known to exist in a small measure and Passion in a<br>measure that is still less. Goodness is the spring that causes the<br>modifications of the senses. It is the great enlightener. No duty has<br>been laid down that is higher than Goodness. They who abide in Goodness<br>proceed upwards. They who abide in Passion remain in the middle. They who<br>abide in Darkness, being characterised by qualities that are low, sink<br>downwards. Darkness occurs in the Sudra; Passion in the Kshatriya; and<br>Goodness, which is the highest, in the Brahmana. The three qualities<br>exist even thus in the three orders. Even from a distance, the three<br>qualities of darkness and Goodness and Passion, are seen to exist in a<br>state of union and more collectively. They are never seen in a state of<br>separation.[110] Beholding the sun rising, men of evil deeds become<br>inspired with fear. Travellers on their way become afflicted with heat,<br>and suffer distress. The Sun is Goodness developed, men of evil deeds<br>represent Darkness; the heat which travellers on their way feel is said<br>to be a quality of Passion. The sun representing light is Goodness; the<br>heat is the quality of Passion; the shading (or eclipse) of the sun on<br>Parvana days should be known to represent Darkness. Even thus, the three<br>qualities exist in all luminous bodies. They act by turns in diverse<br>places in diverse ways. Among immobile objects, the quality of Darkness<br>exists in a very large measure. The qualities appertaining to Passion are<br>those properties of theirs which undergo constant changes. Their<br>oleaginous attributes appertain to Goodness.[111] The Day should be<br>understood as threefold. The Night has been ordained to be threefold. So<br>also are fortnight, months, years, seasons, and conjunctions.[112] The<br>gifts that are wide are threefold. Threefold is sacrifice that flows.<br>Threefold are the worlds; threefold the deities; threefold is knowledge;<br>and threefold the path or end. The past, the Present. and the Future;<br>Religion, Wealth. and Pleasure. Prana, Apana, and Udana; these also are<br>fraught with the three qualities. Whatever object exists in this world,<br>everything in it is fraught with the three qualities. The three qualities<br>act by turns in all things and in all circumstances. Verily, the three<br>qualities always act in an unmanifest form. The creation of those three,<br>viz., Goodness, Passion, and Darkness is eternal. The unmanifest,<br>consisting of the three qualities, is said to be darkness, unperceived,<br>holy, Constant. unborn, womb, eternal. Nature, change or modification,<br>destruction, Pradhana, production, and absorption, undeveloped, not small<br>(i.e., vast), unshaking, immovable, fixed, existent, and non-existent.<br>All these names should be known by those who meditate on matters<br>connected with the soul. That person who accurately knows all the names<br>of the unmanifest, and the qualities, as also the pure operations (of the<br>qualities), is well conversant with the truth about all distinctions and<br>freed from the body, becomes liberated from all the qualities and enjoys<br>absolute happiness.'"
