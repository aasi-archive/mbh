                            "Samvarta said, "There is a peak named Munjaban on the summits of the<br>Himalaya mountains, where the adorable Lord of Uma (Mahadeva) is<br>constantly engaged in austere devotional exercises. There the mighty and<br>worshipful god of great puissance, accompanied by his consort Uma, and<br>armed with his trident, surrounded by wild goblins of many sorts,<br>pursuing his random wish or fancy, constantly resides in the shade of<br>giant forest trees, or in the caves, or on the rugged peaks of the great<br>mountain. And there the Rudras, the Saddhyas, Viswedevas, the Vasus,<br>Yama, Varuna, and Kuvera with all his attendants, and the spirits and<br>goblins, and the two Aswins, the Gandharvas, the Apsaras, the Yakshas, as<br>also the celestial sages, the Sun-gods, as well as the gods presiding<br>over the winds, and evil spirits of all sorts, worship the high-souled<br>lord of Uma, possessed of diverse characteristics. And there, O king, the<br>adorable god sports with the wild and playful followers of Kuvera,<br>possessed of weird and ghostly appearances. Glowing with its own<br>splendour, that mountain looks resplendent as the morning sun. And no<br>creature with his natural eyes made of flesh, can ever ascertain its<br>shape or configuration, and neither heat nor cold prevails there, nor<br>doth the sun shine nor do the winds blow. And, O king, neither doth<br>senility nor hunger, nor thirst, nor death, nor fear afflict any one at<br>that place. And, O foremost of conquerors, on all sides of that mountain,<br>there exist mines of gold, resplendent as the rays of the sun. And O<br>king, the attendants of Kuvera, desirous of doing good to him, protect<br>these mines of gold from intruders, with uplifted arms. Hie thee thither,<br>and appease that adorable god who is known by the names of Sarva, Bedha,<br>Rudra, Sitikantha, Surapa, Suvarcha, Kapardi, Karala, Haryyaksha, Varada,<br>Tryaksha, Pushnodantabhid, Vamana, Siva, Yamya, Avyaktarupa, Sadvritta,<br>Sankara, Kshemya, Harikesa, Sthanu, Purusha, Harinetra, Munda, Krishna,<br>Uttarana, Bhaskara, Sutirtha, Devadeva, Ranha, Ushnishi, Suvaktra,<br>Sahasraksha, Midhvan, Girisa, Prasanta, Yata, Chiravasa, Vilwadanda,<br>Siddha, Sarvadandadhara, Mriga, Vyadha, Mahan, Dhanesa, Bhava, Vara,<br>Somavaktra, Siddhamantra, Chakshu, Hiranyavahu, Ugra, Dikpati, Lelihana,<br>Goshtha, Shiddhamantra, Vrishnu, Pasupati, Bhutapati, Vrisha,<br>Matribhakta, Senani, Madhyama, Sruvahasta, Yati, Dhanwi, Bhargava, Aja,<br>Krishnanetra, Virupaksha, Tikshnadanshtra, Tikshna, Vaiswanaramukha,<br>Mahadyuti, Ananga, Sarva, Dikpati, Bilohita, Dipta, Diptaksha, Mahauja,<br>Vasuretas, Suvapu, Prithu, Kritivasa, Kapalmali, Suvarnamukuta, Mahadeva,<br>Krishna, Tryamvaka, Anagha, Krodhana, Nrisansa, Mridu, Vahusali, Dandi,<br>Taptatapa, Akrurakarma, Sahasrasira, Sahasra-charana, Swadha-swarupa,<br>Vahurupa, Danshtri, Pinaki, Mahadeva, Mahayogi, Avyaya, Trisulahasta,<br>Varada, Tryamvaka, Bhuvaneswara, Tripuraghna, Trinayana, Trilokesa,<br>Mahanja, Sarvabhuta-prabhava, Sarvabhuta-dharana, Dharanidhara, Isana,<br>Sankara, Sarva, Siva, Visveswara, Bhava, Umapati, Pasupati, Viswarupa,<br>Maheswara, Virupaksha, Dasabhuja, Vrishavadhwaja, Ugra, Sthanu, Siva,<br>Rudra, Sarva, Girisa, Iswara, Sitakantha, Aja, Sukra, Prithu, Prithuhara,<br>Vara, Viswarupa, Virupaksha, Vahurupa, Umapati, Anangangahara, Hara,<br>Saranya, Mahadeva, Chaturmukha. There bowing unto that deity, must thou<br>crave his protection. And thus, O prince, making thy submission to that<br>high-souled Mahadeva of great energy, shalt thou acquire that gold. And<br>the men who go there thus, succeed in obtaining the gold. Thus<br>instructed, Marutta, the son of Karandhama, did as he was advised. And<br>made superhuman arrangements for the performance of his sacrifice. And<br>artisans manufactured vessels of gold for that sacrifice. And Vrihaspati<br>too, hearing of the prosperity of Marutta, eclipsing that of the gods,<br>became greatly grieved at heart, and distressed at the thought that his<br>rival Samvarta should become prosperous, became sick at heart, and the<br>glow of his complexion left him, and his frame became emaciated. And when<br>the lord of the gods came to know that Vrihaspati was much aggrieved, he<br>went to him attended by the Immortals and addressed him thus."
