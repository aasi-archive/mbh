                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Meanwhile, Vasudeva of great energy accompanied by<br>the Vrishnis, came to the city called after the elephant. While leaving<br>that city for returning to his own Dwaraka, he had been requested by the<br>son of Dharma to come back. Hence, knowing that the time fixed for the<br>horse-sacrifice had come, that foremost of men came back (to the Kuru<br>capital). Accompanied by the son of Rukmini, by Yuyudhana, by<br>Charudeshna, by Samva, by Gada, by Kritavarman, by the heroic Sarana, by<br>Nisatha, and by the Unmukha, Vasudeva came with Valadeva at the head of<br>the train, with Subhadra also accompanying him. Indeed, that hero came<br>for seeing Draupadi and Uttara and Pirtha and for comforting those<br>Kshatriya ladies of distinction who had been bereft of many of their<br>protectors. Beholding those heroes come, king Dhritarashtra, as also the<br>high-souled Vidura, received them with due honours. That foremost of men,<br>viz., Krishna of great energy, well adored by Vidura and Yuyutsu,<br>continued to reside in the Kuru capital. It was while the Vrishni heroes,<br>O Janamejaya, were residing in the Kuru city, O king, that thy sire, that<br>slayer of hostile heroes, was born. The royal Parikshit, O monarch,<br>afflicted by the Brahma weapon (of Aswatthaman), upon coming out of the<br>womb, lay still and motionless, for life he had not. By his birth he had<br>gladdened the citizens but soon plunged them into grief. The citizens,<br>learning of the birth of the prince, uttered a leonine shout. That noise<br>proceeded to the utmost verge of every point of the compass. Soon,<br>however, (when it was known that the prince was bereft of life), that<br>noise ceased. With great haste Krishna, his senses and mind considerably<br>affected, with Yuyudhana in his company, entered the inner apartments of<br>the palace. He beheld his own paternal aunt (Kunti) coming, loudly<br>weeping and calling upon him repeatedly. Behind her were Draupadi and the<br>famous Subhadra, and the wives of the relatives of the Pandavas, all<br>weeping piteously. Meeting Krishna, Kunti, that daughter of the Bhoja<br>race, said unto him, O foremost of monarchs, these words in a voice<br>chocked with tears, 'O Vasudeva, O mighty-armed hero, Devaki by having<br>borne thee, has come to be regarded as an excellent genetrix. Thou art<br>our refuge, and our glory. This race (of Pandu) depends upon thee for its<br>protector. O Yadava hero, O puissant one, this child of thy sister's son,<br>has come out of the womb, slain by Aswatthaman. O Kesava, do thou revive<br>him. O delighter of the Yadavas, even this was vowed by thee, O puissant<br>one, when Aswatthaman had inspired the blade of grass into a<br>Brahma-weapon of mighty energy. Indeed, O Kesava, thy words were even<br>these, I shall revive that child if he comes out of the womb dead.&#8212;That<br>child, O son, has been born dead. Behold him, O foremost of men. It<br>behoveth thee, O Madhava, to rescue Uttara and Subhadra and Draupadi and<br>myself, and Dharma's son (Yudhishthira), and Bhima and Phalguna, and<br>Nakula, and the irresistible Sahadeva. In this child are bound the<br>life-breaths of the Pandavas and myself. O thou of the Dasarha race, on<br>him depends the obsequial cake of Pandu, as also of my father-in-law, and<br>of Abhimanyu too, blessed be thou, that darling nephew of thine who was<br>so very like unto thee. Do thou accomplish today what will be beneficial<br>to all these. I urge thee earnestly, O Janarddana. Uttara, O slayer of<br>foes, always repeats the words said unto her by Abhimanyu. Without doubt,<br>O Krishna, those words were highly agreeable to her. O thou of the<br>Dasarha race, Arjuna's son said unto this daughter of Virata,&#8212;Thy son, O<br>blessed girl, will go to my maternal uncles. Taking up his residence with<br>the Vrishnis and Andhakas, he will obtain from them the science of arms,<br>indeed, diverse wonderful weapons and the whole of the science of<br>politics and morality. Even these were the words, O son, that that slayer<br>of hostile heroes, viz., the son of Subhadra, that irresistible hero,<br>said unto Uttara. from his affection for her. O slayer of Madhu, bowing<br>our heads unto thee, we pray thee for making those words of Abhimanyu<br>true. In view also of the time that has come, do thou accomplish what is<br>highly beneficial. Having said these words unto that hero of the<br>Vrishni's race, Pritha of large eyes, raised her arms upwards and with<br>the other ladies in her company, fell down on the Earth. All of them,<br>with eyes rendered muddy by tears, repeatedly exclaimed, saying, 'Alas,<br>the son of Vasudeva's nephew has been born dead.' After Kunti had said<br>so, Janarddana took hold of her, O Bharata, and gently raising her from<br>the Earth, comforted her as follows.'"
