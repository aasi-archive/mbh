                            "The Brahmana said, 'There are three foes in the world. They are said to<br>be ninefold, agreeably to their qualities. Exultation, satisfaction, and<br>joy,&#8212;these three qualities appertain to Goodness.[84] Cupidity, wrath,<br>and hatred, these three qualities are said to appertain to Passion.<br>Lassitude, procrastination, and delusion, these three qualities appertain<br>to darkness. Cutting these with showers of arrows, the man of<br>intelligence, free from procrastination, possessed of a tranquil soul,<br>and with his senses under subjection, ventures to vanquish others.[85] In<br>this connection, persons conversant with (the occurrence of) ancient<br>cycles recite some verses which were sung in days of old by king<br>Amvarisha who had acquired a tranquil soul. When diverse kinds of faults<br>were in the ascendant and when the righteous were afflicted, Amvarisha of<br>great fame put forth his strength for assuming sovereignty.[86] Subduing<br>his own faults and worshipping the righteous, he attained to great<br>success and sang these verses.&#8212;I have subdued many faults. I have killed<br>all foes. But there is one, the greatest, vice which deserves to be<br>destroyed but which has not been destroyed by me! Urged by that fault,<br>this Jiva fails to attain to freedom from desire. Afflicted by desire,<br>one runs into ditches without knowing it. Urged by that fault, one<br>indulges in acts that are forbidden. Do thou cut off, cut off, that<br>cupidity with sharp-edged swords. From cupidity arise desires. From<br>desire flows anxiety. The man who yields to desire acquires many<br>qualities that appertain to passion. When these have been acquired, he<br>gets many qualities that appertain to Darkness. In consequence of those<br>qualities, he repeatedly takes birth, with the bonds of body united, and<br>is impelled to action. Upon the expiration of life, with body becoming<br>dismembered and scattered, he once meets with death which is due to birth<br>itself.[87] Hence, duly understanding this, and subduing cupidity by<br>intelligence, one should desire for sovereignty in one's soul. This is<br>(true) sovereignty. There is no other sovereignty here. The soul,<br>properly understood, is the king. Even these were the verses sung by king<br>Ambarisha of great celebrity, on the subject of sovereignty which he kept<br>before him,&#8212;that king who had cut off the one foremost fault viz.,<br>cupidity.'"
