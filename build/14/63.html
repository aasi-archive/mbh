                            "Janamejaya said, 'Having heard these words, O regenerate one, that were<br>spoken by the high-souled Vyasa in respect of the horse-sacrifice, what<br>steps were taken by Yudhishthira? Do thou tell me, O foremost of<br>regenerate ones, how the king succeeded in obtaining the wealth which<br>Marutta had buried in the Earth.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Having heard the words of the Island-born ascetic,<br>king Yudhishthira the just, summoned all his brothers, viz., Arjuna and<br>Bhimasena and the twin sons of Madri, in proper time and then said unto<br>them (the following words),&#8212;'Ye heroes, you have heard the words which<br>the highly intelligent and high-souled Krishna has said from his<br>friendship for and the desire of doing good to the Kurus![178] Verily,<br>you have heard those words that have been uttered by that ascetic of<br>abundant penances, that great sage desirous of bestowing prosperity on<br>his friends, that preceptor of righteous behaviour, viz., Vyasa of<br>wonderful feats. You have heard what Bhishma also said, and what Govinda<br>too of great intelligence has uttered. Remembering those words, ye gong<br>of Pandu, I desire to obey them duly. By obeying those words of theirs<br>great blessedness will attach to all of you. Those words spoken by those<br>utterers of Brahma are certain (if obeyed) to bring in their train<br>considerable benefit. Ye perpetuators of Kuru's race, the Earth has<br>become divested of her wealth. Ye kings, Vyasa, therefore, informed us of<br>the wealth (that lies buried in the Earth) of Marutta. If you think that<br>wealth abundant or sufficient, how shall we bring it (to our capital)?<br>What, O Bhima, dost thou think as regards this? When the king, O<br>perpetuator of Kuru's race, said these words, Bhimasena, joining his<br>hands, said these words in reply,&#8212;'The words thou hast said, O thou of<br>mighty-arms, on the subject of bringing the wealth indicated by Vyasa,<br>are approved by me. If, O puissant one, we succeed in getting the wealth<br>kept there by the son of Avikshita, then this sacrifice, O king, purposed<br>by us will be easily accomplished. Even this is what I think. We shall,<br>therefore, bowing our heads unto the high-souled Girisa, and offering due<br>worship unto that deity, bring that wealth. Blessed be thou. Gratifying<br>that god of gods, as also his companions and followers, in words,<br>thought, and deed, we shall, without doubt, obtain that wealth. Those<br>Kinnaras of fierce mien who are protecting that treasure will certainly<br>yield to us if the great deity having the bull for his sign become<br>gratified with us!'&#8212;Hearing these words uttered by Bhima, O Bharata,<br>king Yudhishthira the son of Dharma became highly pleased. The others,<br>headed by Arjuna, at the same time, said, 'So be it.' The Pandavas then,<br>having resolved to bring that wealth, ordered their forces to march under<br>the constellation Dhruba and on the day called by the same name.[179]<br>Causing the Brahmanas to utter benedictions on them, and having duly<br>worshipped the great god Maheswara, the sons of Pandu get out (on their<br>enterprise). Gratifying that high-souled deity with Modakas and frumenty<br>and with cakes made of meat, the sons of Pandu set out with cheerful<br>hearts. While they thus set out, the citizen, and many foremost of<br>Brahmanas, with cheerful hearts, uttered auspicious blessings (on their<br>heads). The Pandavas, circumambulating many Brahmanas that daily<br>worshipped their fires, and bending their heads unto them, proceeded on<br>their journey. Taking the permission of king Dhritarashtra who was<br>afflicted with grief on account of the death of his sons, his queen<br>(Gandhari), and Pritha also of large eyes, and keeping the Kaurava prince<br>Yuyutsu, the son of Dhritarashtra, in the capital, they set out,<br>worshipped by the citizens and by many Brahmanas possessed of great<br>wisdom.'"
