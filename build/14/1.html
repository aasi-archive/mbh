                            (Aswamedhika Parva)<br><br>OM! HAVING BOWED down unto Narayana, and Nara the foremost of male<br>beings, and unto the goddess Saraswati, must the word Jaya be uttered.<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, "After the king Dhritarashtra had offered libations<br>of water (unto the manes of Bhisma), the mighty-armed[1] Yudhishthira,<br>with his senses bewildered, placing the former in his front, ascended the<br>banks (of the river), his eyes suffused with tears, and dropt down on the<br>bank of the Ganga like an elephant pierced by the hunter. Then incited by<br>Krishna, Bhima took him up sinking. 'This must not be so,' said Krishna,<br>the grinder of hostile hosts. The Pandavas, O king, saw Yudhishthira, the<br>son of Dharma, troubled and lying on the ground, and also sighing again<br>and again. And seeing the king despondent and feeble, the Pandavas,<br>overwhelmed with grief, sat down, surrounding him. And endowed with high<br>intelligence and having the sight of wisdom, king Dhritarashtra,<br>exceedingly afflicted with grief for his sons, addressed the monarch,<br>saying,&#8212;'Rise up, O thou tiger among the Kurus. Do thou now attend to<br>thy duties. O Kunti's son, thou hast conquered this Earth according to<br>the usage of the Kshatriyas. Do thou now, O lord of men, enjoy her with<br>thy brothers and friends. O foremost of the righteous, I do not see why<br>thou shouldst grieve. O lord of the Earth, having lost a hundred sons<br>like unto riches obtained in a dream, it is Gandhari and I, who should<br>mourn. Not having listened to the pregnant words of the high-souled<br>Vidura, who sought our welfare, I, of perverse senses, (now) repent. The<br>virtuous Vidura, endowed with divine insight, had told me,&#8212;'Thy race<br>will meet with annihilation owing to the transgressions of Duryodhana. O<br>king, if thou wish for the weal of thy line, act up to my advice. Cast<br>off this wicked-minded monarch, Suyodhana, and let not either Karna or<br>Sakuni by any means see him. Their gambling too do thou, without making<br>any fuss suppress, and anoint the righteous king Yudhishthira. That one<br>of subdued senses will righteously govern the Earth. If thou wouldst not<br>have king Yudhishthira, son of Kunti, then, O monarch, do thou,<br>performing a sacrifice, thyself take charge of the kingdom, and regarding<br>all creatures with an even eye, O lord of men, do thou let thy kinsmen. O<br>thou advancer of thy kindred, subsist on thy bounty.' When, O Kunti's<br>son, the far-sighted Vidura said this, fool that I was I followed the<br>wicked Duryodhana. Having turned a deaf ear to the sweet speech of that<br>sedate one, I have obtained this mighty sorrow as a consequence, and have<br>been plunged in an ocean of woe. Behold thy old father and mother, O<br>king, plunged in misery. But, O master of men, I find no occasion for thy<br>grief.'"
