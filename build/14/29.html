                            "The Brahmana said, 'In this connection is cited the ancient story, O<br>lady, of the discourse between Karttaviryya and the Ocean. There was a<br>king of the name of Karttaviryya-Arjuna who was endued with a thousand<br>arms. He conquered, with his bow, the Earth, extending to the shores of<br>the ocean. It has been heard by us that, once on a time, as he was<br>walking on the shores of the sea, proud of his might, he showered<br>hundreds of shafts on that vast receptacle of waters. The Ocean, bowing<br>down unto him, said, with joined hands,&#8212;Do not, O hero, shoot thy shafts<br>(at me)! Say, what shall I do to thee. With these mighty arrows shot by<br>thee, those creatures which have taken shelter in me are being killed, O<br>tiger among kings. Do thou, O lord, grant them security.'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'If any wielder of the bow exists that is equal to me in<br>battle, and that would stand against me in the field, do thou name him to<br>me!'<br><br>"The Ocean said, If thou hast heard, O king, of the great Rishi<br>Jamadagni, his son is competent to duly receive thee as a guest.&#8212;Then<br>that king proceeded, filled with great wrath. Arrived at that retreat, he<br>found Rama himself. With his kinsmen he began to do many acts that were<br>hostile to Rama, and caused much trouble to that high-souled hero. Then<br>the energy, which was immeasurable of Rama blazed forth, burning the<br>troops of the foe, O lotus-eyed one. Taking up his battle-axe, Rama<br>suddenly put forth his power, and hacked that thousand-armed hero, like a<br>tree of many branches. Beholding him slain and prostrated on the earth,<br>all his kinsmen, uniting together, and taking up their darts, rushed at<br>Rama, who was then seated, from all sides. Rama also, taking up his bow<br>and quickly ascending on his car, shot showers of arrows and chastised<br>the army of the king. Then, some of the Kshatriyas, afflicted with the<br>terror of Jamadagni's son, entered mountain-fastnesses, like deer<br>afflicted by the lion. Of them that were unable, through fear of Rama, to<br>discharge the duties ordained for their order, the progeny became<br>Vrishalas owing to their inability to find Brahmanas.[81] In this way<br>Dravidas and Abhiras and Pundras, together with the Savaras, became<br>Vrishalas through those men who had Kshatriya duties assigned to them (in<br>consequence of their birth), falling away (from those duties). Then the<br>Kshatriyas that were begotten by the Brahmanas upon Kshatriya women that<br>had lost their heroic children, were repeatedly destroyed by Jamadagni's<br>son. The slaughter proceeded one and twenty times. At its conclusion a<br>bodiless voice, sweet and proceeding from heaven, and which was heard by<br>all people, spoke to Rama, 'O Rama, O Rama, desist! What met it dost thou<br>see, O son, in thus destroying repeatedly these inferior Kshatriyas?'[82]<br>In this way, O blessed dame, his grandsires, headed by Richika, addressed<br>that high-souled one, saying. 'Do thou desist.' Rama, however, unable to<br>forgive the slaughter of his sire, replied unto those Rishis saying, 'It<br>behoves you not to forbid me.' The Pitris then said, 'O foremost of all<br>victorious men, it behoves thee not to slay these inferior Kshatriyas. It<br>is not proper that thyself, being a Brahmana, should slay these kings.'"
