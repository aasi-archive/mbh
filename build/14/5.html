                            "Indra said, "Even so it is; the might of Brahmanas is great and there<br>are none more powerful than Brahmanas, but I can never bear with<br>equanimity the insolent pride of Avikshita's son, and so shall I smite<br>him with my thunderbolt. Therefore, O Dhritarashtra, do thou according to<br>my direction repair to king Marutta attended by Samvarta, and deliver<br>this message to him&#8212;'Do thou, O prince, accept Vrihaspati as thy<br>spiritual preceptor, as otherwise, I shall strike thee with my terrific<br>thunderbolt.'"<br><br>Vyasa said, "Then Dhritarashtra betook himself to that monarch's court<br>and delivered this message to him from Vasava."<br><br>Dhritarashtra said, "O lord of men, know that I am Dhritarashtra the<br>Gandharva, come here with the object [of] delivering to thee the message<br>of Indra. Do thou, O lion among kings, listen to the words which the<br>high-souled lord of all the worlds meant for thee,&#8212;That one of<br>incomprehensible achievements (Indra) only said this much, 'Do thou<br>accept Vrihaspati as thy officiating priest for the sacrifice, or if thou<br>do not comply with my request, I shall strike thee with my terrific<br>thunderbolt.'"<br><br>Marutta said, "Thou, O Purandara, the Viswadevas, the Vasus and the<br>Aswins ye all know, that in this world there is no escape from the<br>consequences of playing false to a friend; it is a great sin like unto<br>that of murdering a Brahman. Let Vrihaspati (therefore) officiate as<br>priest to that Mahendra the supreme Deva (god), the highest one wielding<br>the thunderbolt, and O prince, Samvarta will act as my priest, as neither<br>his (Indra's) words, nor thine commend themselves to me."<br><br>The Gandharva said, "Do thou, O lion among princes, listen to the<br>terrible war-cry of Vasava roaring, in the heavens. Assuredly, and openly<br>will Mahendra hurl his thunderbolt at thee. Do thou therefore be-think<br>thyself of thy good, for this is the time to do it."<br><br>Vyasa said, "Thus accosted by Dhritarashtra, and hearing the roar of<br>howling Vasava, the king communicated this intelligence to Samvarta<br>steadfast in devotion and the highest of all virtuous men."<br><br>Marutta said, "Verily this rain-cloud floating in the air indicates that<br>Indra must be near at present, therefore, O prince of Brahmanas, I seek<br>shelter from thee. Do thou, O best of Brahmanas, remove this fear of<br>Indra from my mind. The Wielder of the thunderbolt is coming encompassing<br>the ten directions of space with his terrible and superhuman refulgence<br>and my assistants at this sacrificial assembly have been overcome with<br>fright.<br><br>Samvarta said, "O lion among kings, thy fear of Sakra will soon be<br>dispelled, and I shall soon remove this terrible pain by means of my<br>magic lore (incantation); be calm and have no fear of being overpowered<br>by India. Thou hast nothing to fear from the god of a hundred sacrifices.<br>I shall use my staying charms, O king, and the weapons of all the gods<br>will avail them not. Let the lightening flash in all the directions of<br>space, and the winds entering into the clouds pour down the showers amid<br>the forests and the waters deluge the heavens and the flashes of<br>lightning that are seen will avail not. Thou hast nothing to fear, let<br>Vasava pour down the rains and plast his terrific thunderbolt where he<br>will, floating among the watery masses (clouds) for thy destruction, for<br>the god Vahnni (Agni) will protect thee in every way, and make thee<br>attain all the objects of thy desire."<br><br>Marutta said, "This appalling crash of the thunderbolt together with the<br>howling of the winds, seem terrible to my ears and my heart is afflicted<br>again and again, O Brahmana, and my peace of mind is gone at present."<br><br>Samvarta said, "O king, the feat in thy mind from this terrible<br>thunderbolt will leave thee presently. I shall dispel the thunder by the<br>aid of the winds, and setting aside all fear from thy mind, do thou<br>accept a boon from me according to thy heart's desire, and I shall<br>accomplish it for thee."<br><br>Marutta said, "I desire, O Brahmana, that Indra all on a sudden should<br>come in person at this sacrifice, and accept the oblation offered to him,<br>and that all the other gods also come and take their own shares of the<br>offerings and accept the libations of Soma offered to them."<br><br>Samvarta said, "I have by the power of my incantations attracted Indra in<br>person to this sacrifice. Behold, O monarch, Indra coming with his<br>horses, and worshipped by the other gods hastening to this sacrifice."<br><br>Then the lord of the Devas attended by the other gods and riding in his<br>chariot drawn by the most excellent steeds, approached the sacrificial<br>altar of that son of Avikshit and drank the Soma libations of that<br>unrivalled monarch. And king Marutta with his priest rose to receive<br>Indra coming with the host of gods and well-pleased in mind, he welcomed<br>the lord of the Devas with due and foremost honours according to the<br>Sastras.<br><br>Samvarta said, "Welcome to thee, O Indra, by thy presence here, O learned<br>one, this sacrifice has been made grand. O slayer or Vala and Vritra. do<br>thou again quaff this Soma juiced produced by me today.'<br><br>Marutta said, "Do thou look with kindness upon me, I bow unto thee, O<br>Indra, by thy presence, my sacrifice has been perfected, and my life too<br>blessed with good results. O Surendra, this excellent Brahmana, the<br>younger brother of Vrihaspati is engaged in performing my sacrifices."<br><br>Indra said. "I know thy priest, this highly energetic ascetic, the<br>younger brother of Vrihaspati, at whose invitation I have come to this<br>sacrifice. I am, O monarch, well-pleased with thee and my resentment<br>against thee hath been destroyed."<br><br>Samvarta said, "If, O prince of the Devas, thou art pleased with us, do<br>thou thyself give all the directions for this sacrifice, and O Surendra,<br>thyself ordain the sacrificial portions (for the gods), so that, O god,<br>all the world may know that it hath been done by thee."<br><br>Vyasa said, "Thus accosted by the son of Angira, Sakra himself gave<br>directions to all the gods to erect the hall of assembly, and a thousand<br>well-furnished excellent rooms looking grand as in a picture, and<br>speedily to complete the staircase massive and durable, for the ascent of<br>the Gandharvas and Apsaras and to furnish that portion of the sacrificial<br>ground reserved for the dance of the Apsaras, like unto the palace of<br>Indra in the heaven. O king, thus directed, the renowned dwellers of<br>heaven speedily fulfilled the directions of Sakra. And then, O king,<br>Indra well-pleased and adored, thus said to king Marutta,&#8212;O prince, by<br>associating with thee at this sacrifice, thine ancestors who have gone<br>before thee, as well as the other gods have been highly gratified and<br>have accepted the oblations offered by thee. And now, O king, let the<br>foremost of regenerate beings offer on the sacrificial altar a red bull<br>appertaining to the Fire-god and a sacred and duly consecrated blue bull<br>with a variegated skin, appertaining to the Viswedevas. Then, O king, the<br>sacrificial ceremony grew in splendour, wherein the gods themselves<br>collected the food, and Sakra, the lord of the gods, possessed of horses,<br>and worshipped by the Brahmanas, became an assistant at the sacrifice.<br>And then the high-souled Samvarta ascending the altar, and looking<br>radiant as the second embodiment of the blazing fire, loudly addressing<br>the gods with complaisance, offered oblations of clarified butter to the<br>fire with incantation of the sacred hymns. And then the slayer of Vala<br>first drank the Soma juice, and then the assembly of other gods drank<br>Soma. And then in happiness and with the king's permission they returned<br>home and well-pleased and delighted. Then that monarch, the slayer of his<br>enemies, with a delighted heart, placed heaps of gold on diverse spots,<br>and distributing the immense wealth to the Brahmanas, he looked glorious<br>like Kuvera, the god of wealth. And with a buoyant heart, the king filled<br>his treasury with different kinds of wealth, and with the permission of<br>his spiritual preceptor, he returned (to his kingdom) and continued to<br>rule the entire realm extending to the borders of the sea. So virtuous in<br>this world was that king, at whose sacrifice such an enormous quantity of<br>gold vas collected, and now, O prince, thou must collect that gold and<br>worshipping the gods with due rites, do thou perform this sacrifice."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Then the Pandava prince Yudhishthira was<br>delighted on hearing this speech of the son of Satyavati (Vyasa), and<br>desirous of performing his sacrifice with those riches, he held repeated<br>consultations with his ministers."
