                            "Vaisampayana said, 'That foremost of steeds then proceeded to the realm<br>of Pragjyotisha and began to wander there. At this, Bhagadatta's son, who<br>was exceedingly valorous in battle, came out (for encountering Arjuna).<br>King Vajradatta, O chief of the Bharatas, finding the (sacrificial) steed<br>arrived within his realm, fought (for detaining it). The royal son of<br>Bhagadatta, issuing out of his city, afflicted the steed that was coming<br>(and seizing it), marched back towards his own place. Marking this, the<br>mighty-armed chief of the Kuru race, speedily stretched his Gandiva, and<br>suddenly rushed towards his foe. Stupefied by the shafts sped from<br>Gandiva, the heroic son of Bhagadatta, letting off loose the steed, fled<br>from Partha.[191] Once more entering his capital, that foremost of kings,<br>irresistible in battle, cased himself in mail, and mounting on his prince<br>of elephants, came out. That mighty car-warrior had a white umbrella held<br>over his head, and was fanned with a milk-white yak-tail. Impelled by<br>childishness and folly, he challenged Partha, the mighty car-warrior of<br>the Pandavas, famed for terrible deeds in battle, to an encounter with<br>him. The enraged prince then urged towards Arjuna that elephant of his,<br>which resembled a veritable mountain, and from whose temples and mouth<br>issued streams of juice indicative of excitement. Indeed, that elephant<br>showered its secretions like a mighty mass of clouds pouring rain.<br>Capable of resisting hostile feats of its own species, it had been<br>equipped agreeably to the ordinances of the treatises (on war-elephants).<br>Irresistible in battle, it had become so infuriate as to be beyond<br>control. Urged on by the prince with the iron-hook, that mighty elephant<br>then seemed (as it advanced) as if it would cut through the welkin (like<br>a flying hill). Beholding it advance towards him, O king, Dhananjaya,<br>filled with rage and standing on the earth, O Bharata, encountered the<br>prince on its back. Filled with wrath, Vajradatta quickly sped at Arjuna<br>a number of broad-headed shafts endued with the energy of fire and<br>resembling (as they coursed through the air) a cloud of speedily-moving<br>locusts. Arjuna, however, with shafts sped from Gandiva, cut off those<br>arrows, some into two and some into three pieces. He cut them off in the<br>welkin itself with those shafts of his coursing through the welkin. The<br>son of Bhagadatta, beholding his broad-headed shafts thus cut off,<br>quickly sped at Arjuna a number of other arrows in a continuous line.<br>Filled with rage at this, Arjuna, more quickly than before, shot at<br>Bhagadatta's son a number of straightly coursing arrows equipt with<br>golden wings. Vajradatta of mighty energy, struck with great force and<br>pierced with these arrows in that fierce encounter, fell down on the<br>Earth. Consciousness, however, did not desert him. Mounting on his prince<br>of elephants again in the midst of that battle the son of Bhagadatta,<br>desirous of victory, very coolly sped a number of shafts at Arjuna.<br>Filled with wrath, Jishnu then sped at the prince a number of arrows that<br>looked like blazing flames of fire and that seemed to be so many snakes<br>of virulent poison. Pierced therewith, the mighty elephant, emitting a<br>large quantity of blood, looked like a mountain of many springs<br>discharging rills of water coloured with red chalk.'"
