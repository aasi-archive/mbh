                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Thus waged that battle, O chief of the Bharatas, for<br>three days between Arjuna and that prince like the encounter between him<br>of a hundred sacrifices and Vritra. On the fourth day, Vajradatta of<br>great might laughed loudly and, addressing Arjuna, said these words:<br>'Wait, wait, O Arjuna. Thou shalt not escape me with life. Slaying thee I<br>shall duly discharge the water-rite of my sire. My aged sire, Bhagadatta,<br>who was the friend of thy sire, was slain by thee in consequence of his<br>weight of years. Do thou, however, fight me that am but a boy!'[192]<br>Having said these words, O thou of Kuru's race, king Vajradatta, filled<br>with rage, urged his elephant towards the son of Pandu. Urged on by<br>Vajradatta of great intelligence, that prince of elephants, as if<br>desirous of cutting through the welkin, rushed towards Dhananjaya. That<br>prince of elephants drenched Arjuna with a shower of juice emitted from<br>the end of his trunk, like a mass of blue clouds drenching a hill with<br>its downpour. Indeed, urged on by the king, elephant, repeatedly roaring<br>like a cloud, rushed towards Phalguna, with that deep noise emitted from<br>its mouth. Verily, urged on by Vajradatta, that prince of elephants<br>quickly moved towards the mighty car-warrior of the Kurus, with the tread<br>of one that seemed to dance in excitement. Beholding that beast of<br>Vajradatta advance towards him, that slayer of foes, viz., the mighty<br>Dhananjaya, relying on Gandiva, stood his ground without shaking with<br>fear. Recollecting what an obstacle Vajradatta was proving to the<br>accomplishment of his task, and remembering the old enmity of the house<br>(of Pragjyotisha towards the Pandavas), the son of Pandu became<br>exceedingly inflamed with wrath against the king. Filled with rage,<br>Dhananjaya impeded the course of that beast with a shower of arrows like<br>the shore resisting the surging sea. That prince of elephants possessed<br>of beauty (of form), thus impeded by Arjuna, stopped in its course, with<br>body pierced with many an arrow, like a porcupine with its quills erect.<br>Seeing his elephant impeded in its course, the royal son of Bhagadatta,<br>deprived of sense by rage, shot many whetted arrows at Arjuna. The<br>mighty-armed Arjuna baffled all those arrows with many foe-slaying shafts<br>of his. The feat seemed to be exceedingly wonderful. Once more the king<br>of the Pragjyotishas, inflamed with ire, forcibly urged his elephant,<br>which resembled a mountain, at Arjuna. Beholding the beast once more<br>advancing towards him, Arjuna shot with great strength a shaft at it that<br>resembled a veritable flame of fire. Struck deeply in the very vitals, O<br>king, by the son of Pandu, the beast suddenly fell down on the Earth like<br>a mountain summit loosened by a thunder-bolt. Struck with Dhartanjaya's<br>shaft, the elephant, as it lay on the Earth, looked like a huge mountain<br>cliff lying on the ground, loosened by the bolt of Indra. When the<br>elephant of Vajradatta was prostrated on the ground, the son of Pandu,<br>addressing the king who had fallen down with his beast, said,&#8212;'Do not<br>fear. Indeed, Yudhishthira of mighty energy said unto me while<br>commissioning me for this task even these words,&#8212;'Thou shouldst not, O<br>Dhananjaya, slay those kings (who may encounter thee in battle). O tiger<br>among men, thou shouldst regard thy task as accomplished if only thou<br>disablest those hostile kings. Thou shouldst not also, O Dhananjaya, slay<br>the warriors of those kings who may come forth to fight thee, with all<br>their kinsmen and friends. They should be requested to come to the<br>horse-sacrifice of Yudhishthira.'&#8212;Having heard these commands of my<br>brother, I shall not slay thee, O king. Rise up; let no fear be thine;<br>return to thy city safe and sound, O lord of Earth. When the day of full<br>moon in the month of Chaitra comes, thou shalt, O great king, repair to<br>that sacrifice of king Yudhishthira the just, for it takes place on that<br>day. Thus addressed by Arjuna, the royal son of Bhagadatta, defeated by<br>the son of Pandu, said,&#8212;'So be it.'"
