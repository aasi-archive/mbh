                            "Janamejaya said, 'With what penances was the high-souled Utanka endued<br>so that he entertained the wish to denounce a curse on Vishnu himself,<br>who is the source of all puissance?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'O Janamejaya, Utanka was endued with austere<br>penances. He was devoted to his preceptor. Endued with great energy, he<br>abstained from worshipping anybody else. All the children of the Rishis O<br>Bharata, entertained even this wish, viz., that their devotion to<br>preceptors should be as great as that of Utanka. Gautama's gratification<br>with and affection for Utanka, among his numerous disciples, were very<br>great, O Janamejaya. Indeed, Gautama was highly pleased with the<br>self-restraint and purity of behaviour that characterised Utanka, and<br>with his acts of prowess and the services he rendered to him. One after<br>another, thousands of disciples received the preceptor's permission to<br>return home (after the completion of their pupilage). In consequence,<br>however, of his great affection for Utanka, Gautama could not permit him<br>to leave his retreat. Gradually, in course of time, O son, decrepitude<br>overtook Utanka, that great ascetic. The ascetic, however, in consequence<br>of his devotion to his preceptor, was not conscious of it. One day, he<br>set out, O monarch, for fetching fuel for his preceptor. Soon after<br>Utanka brought a heavy load of fuel. Toil-worn and hungry and afflicted<br>by the load he bore on his head, O chastiser of foes, he threw the load<br>down on the Earth, O king. One of his matted locks, white as silver, had<br>become entangled with the load. Accordingly, when the load was thrown<br>down, with it fell on the earth that matted lock of hair. Oppressed as he<br>had been by that load and overcome by hunger, O Bharata, Utanka,<br>beholding that sign of old age, began to indulge in loud lamentations<br>from excess of sorrow. Conversant with every duty, the daughter of his<br>preceptor the, who was possessed of eyes that resembled the petals of the<br>lotus, and of hips that were full and round, at the command of her sire,<br>sought, with downcast face, to hold Utanka's tears in her hands. Her<br>hands seemed to burn with those tear-drops that she held. Unable,<br>accordingly, to hold them longer, she was obliged to throw them down on<br>the Earth. The Earth herself was unable to hold those tear-drops of<br>Utanka. With a gratified heart, Gautama then said unto the regenerate<br>Utanka,&#8212;Why, O son, is thy mind so afflicted with grief today? Tell me<br>calmly and quietly, O learned Rishi, for I wish to hear it in detail.'<br><br>"Utanka said, 'With mind entirely devoted to thee, and wholly bent upon<br>doing what is agreeable to thee, with my, heart's devotion turned to<br>thee, and with thoughts entirely dwelling on thee, (I have resided here<br>till) decrepitude has come upon me without my knowing it at all. I have<br>not, again, known any happiness. Though I have dwelt with thee for a<br>hundred years, yet thou hast not granted me permission to depart. Many<br>disciples of thine, that were my juniors, have, however, been permitted<br>by thee to return. Indeed, hundreds and thousands of foremost Brahmanas<br>have, equipt with knowledge, been permitted by thee (to depart from thy<br>retreat and set themselves up as teachers)!'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'Through my love and affection for thee, and in<br>consequence of thy dutiful services to me, a long time has elapsed<br>without my knowing it, O foremost of Brahmanas. If, however, O thou of<br>Bhrigu's race, the desire is entertained by thee of leaving this place,<br>do thou go without delay, receiving my permission.'<br><br>"Utanka said. 'What shall I present to my preceptor? Tell me this, O best<br>of regenerate persons. Having brought it, I shall go hence, O lord, with<br>thy permission.'<br><br>"Gautama said. 'The good that the gratification of the preceptor is the<br>final fee.[171] Without doubt, O regenerate one. I have been highly<br>gratified with thy conduct. Know, O perpetuator of Bhrigu's race, that I<br>have been exceedingly gratified with thee for this. If thou becomest a<br>young man today of sixteen years, I shall bestow on thee, O regenerate<br>one, this my own daughter for becoming thy wife. No other woman save this<br>one is capable of waiting upon thy energy.' At these words of Gautama,<br>Utanka once again became a youth and accepted that famous maiden for his<br>wife. Receiving the permission of his preceptor, he then addressed his<br>preceptor's wife, saying,&#8212;'What shall I give thee as final fee for my<br>preceptor? Do thou command me. I desire to accomplish, with wealth or<br>even my life, what is agreeable and beneficial to thee. Whatever gem,<br>exceedingly wonderful and of great value, exists in this world, I shall<br>bring for thee with the aid of my penances. I have no doubt in this.'<br><br>"Ahalya said, 'I am highly gratified with thee, O learned Brahmana, with<br>thy unintermitting devotion, O sinless one. This is enough. Blessed be<br>thou, go whithersoever thou likest.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Utanka, however, O monarch, once more, said<br>these words,&#8212;Do thou command me, O mother. It is meet that I should do<br>something that is agreeable to thee.'<br><br>"Ahalya said, 'Blessed be thou, bring for me those celestial ear-rings<br>that are worn by the wife of Saudasa. That which is due to thy preceptor<br>will then be well-discharged.' Replying unto her 'So be it,'&#8212;Utanka<br>departed, O Janamejaya, resolved to bring those ear-rings for doing what<br>was agreeable to his preceptor's wife. That foremost of Brahmanas,<br>Utanka, proceeded without any loss of time to Saudasa who had (through<br>the curse of Vasishtha) become a cannibal, in order to solicit the<br>ear-rings from him. Gautama meanwhile said unto his wife,&#8212;'Utanka is not<br>to be seen today.' Thus addressed, she informed him how he had departed<br>for fetching the jewelled ear-rings (of Saudasa's queen). At this,<br>Gautama said,&#8212;'Thou hast not acted wisely. Cursed (by Vasishtha), that<br>king (who has been transformed into a man-eater) will verily slay Utanka.'<br><br>"Ahalya said, 'Without knowing this, O holy one, I have set Utanka to<br>this task. He shall not, however, incur any danger through thy grace.<br>Thus addressed by her, Gautama said,&#8212;'Let it be so!' Meanwhile, Utanka<br>met king Saudasa in a deserted forest.'"
