                            (Anugita Parva)<br><br>"Janamejaya said, "When the high-souled Kesava and Arjuna after slaying<br>their enemies repaired to the assembly rooms, what conversation, O<br>regenerate one, took place between them?'<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "The son of Pritha (Arjuna), having recovered his own<br>kingdom, joyously spent his time, without doing anything else, in the<br>company of Krishna, his heart filled with delight, in that palace of<br>celestial beauty. One day, those two listlessly proceeded to a particular<br>part of the palace that looked, O king, like a veritable portion of<br>Heaven. Themselves filled with delight, they were then surrounded by<br>their relatives and attendents. Pandu's son, Arjuna, filled with joy in<br>the company of Krishna, surveyed that delightful mansion, and then<br>addressed his companion, saying, 'O&#8212;mighty-armed one, thy greatness<br>became known to me upon the approach of the battle. O son of Devaki, thy<br>form also, as the Lord of the universe, then became known to me! What thy<br>holy self said unto me at that time, O Kesava, through affection, has all<br>been forgotten by me, O chief of men, in consequence of the fickleness of<br>my mind. Repeatedly, however, have I been curious on the subject of those<br>truths. Thou again, O Madhava, wilt repair to Dwaraka soon.'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by him, Krishna of mighty energy,<br>that foremost of speakers, embraced Phalguna and replied unto him as<br>follows.<br><br>'Vasudeva said, 'I made thee listen to truths that are regarded as<br>mysteries. I imparted to thee truths that are eternal. Verily, I<br>discoursed to thee on Religion in its true form and on all the eternal<br>regions. It is exceedingly disagreeable to me to learn that thou didst<br>not, from folly, receive what I imparted. The recollection of all that I<br>told thee on that occasion will not come to me now. Without doubt, O son<br>of Pandu, thou art destitute of faith and thy understanding is not good.<br>It is impossible for me, O Dhananjaya, to repeat, in detail, all that I<br>said on that occasion. That religion (about which I discoursed to thee<br>then) is more than sufficient for understanding Brahma. I cannot<br>discourse on it again in detail. I discoursed to thee on Supreme Brahma,<br>having concentrated myself in Yoga. I shalt now, however, recite to thee<br>an old history upon the same topic. O foremost of all persons, observant<br>of duty, listen to everything I now say, so that, with an understanding<br>adapted to my teaching, thou mayst succeed in attaining to the highest<br>end. O chastiser of foes, on one occasion, a Brahmana came to us from the<br>regions of Heaven. Of irresistible energy, he came from the regions of<br>the Grandsire. He was duly reverenced by us. Listen. O son of Pritha,<br>without yielding to scruples of any kind, to what he, O chief of<br>Bharata's race, said, in answer to our enquiries, agreeably to heavenly<br>forms.'<br><br>The Brahmana said, That which thou askest me, O Krishna, connected with<br>the religion of Moksha (Emancipation), led by thy compassion for all<br>creatures (and not for thy own good),&#8212;that, indeed, which destroys all<br>delusion, O thou that art possessed of supreme puissance[6] I shall now<br>tell thee duly, O slayer of Madhu. Do thou listen with concentrated<br>attention as I discourse to thee, O Madhava. A Brahmana of the name of<br>Kasyapa, possessed of penances and the foremost of all persons conversant<br>with duties, came to a certain other Brahmana who had become conversant<br>with all the mysteries of religion.[7] Indeed, the latter had mastered<br>all the knowledge which the scriptures teach respecting the departure and<br>reappearance of beings and possessed that direct knowledge of all things<br>which Yoga gives. He was well skilled in the truths of all topics<br>relating to the world. He had mastered the truth about pleasure and pain.<br>He knew the truth about birth and death, and understood the distinctions<br>between merit and demerit. He was a beholder of the ends attained to by<br>embodied creatures high and low in consequence of their acts. He lived<br>like one emancipated from the world. Crowned with ascetic success and<br>possessed of perfect tranquillity of soul, he had all his senses under<br>complete control. He seemed to blaze with the resplendence of Brahma and<br>was capable of going everywhere at will. He knew the science of<br>disappearing at will from before the eyes of all. He used to rove in the<br>company of invisible Siddhas and celestial musicians. He used to sit and<br>converse with them on some spot retired from the bustle of humanity. He<br>was as unattached to all things as the wind. Kasyapa having heard of him<br>truly, desired to see him. Possessed of intelligence, that foremost of<br>all Brahmanas, approached the sage. Himself possessed of penances,<br>Kasyapa, moved by the desire of acquiring merit, fell, with a rapt heart,<br>at the feet of the sage when he had seen all those wonderful attributes.<br>Filled with wonder at the sight of those extraordinary accomplishments,<br>Kasyapa began to wait upon that foremost of all Brahmanas, with the<br>dutiful reverence of a disciple waiting upon his preceptor and succeeded<br>in propitiating him. By his devotion, O scorcher of foes, rendering to<br>hint the obedience due from a disciple to a preceptor, Kasyapa gratified<br>that Brahmana who possessed all these accomplishments and was endued,<br>besides, with scriptural learning and excellent conduct. Gratified with<br>Kasyapa, that Brahmana one day addressed him cheerfully and spoke as<br>follows, with an eye to the highest success. Listen to those words, O<br>Janarddana, as I repeat them.<br><br>"&#8212;'The ascetic crowned with success said,'&#8212;By diverse acts, O son, as<br>also by the aid of merit, mortal creatures attain to diverse ends here<br>and residence in Heaven. Nowhere is the highest happiness; nowhere can<br>residence be eternal. There are repeated falls from the highest regions<br>acquired with such sorrow. In consequence of my indulgence in sin, I had<br>to attain to diverse miserable and inauspicious ends, filled as I was<br>with lust and wrath, and deluded by cupidity. I have repeatedly undergone<br>death and rebirth. I have eaten diverse kinds of food, I have sucked at<br>diverse breasts. I have seen diverse kinds of mothers, and diverse<br>fathers dissimilar to one another. Diverse kinds of happiness have been<br>mine and diverse kinds of misery, O sinless one. On diverse occasions<br>have I been separated from what was agreeable and united with what was<br>disagreeable. Having earned wealth with great toil I have had to put up<br>with its loss. Insults and excessive misery I have received from king and<br>relatives. Mental and physical pain, of great severity, have been mine.<br>Humiliations I have undergone, and death and immurement under<br>circumstances of great severity. Falls into Hell have been mine, and<br>great tortures in the domains of Yama. Decrepitude and diseases have<br>repeatedly assailed me, and calamities, as frequent, in copious measure.<br>In this world I have repeatedly undergone all those afflictions that flow<br>from a perception of all pairs of opposites. After all this, one day,<br>overwhelmed with sorrow, blank despair came upon me. I took refuge in the<br>Formless. Afflicted as I was with great distress, I gave up the world<br>with all its joys and sorrows.[8] Understanding then this path, I<br>exercised myself in it in this world. Afterwards, through tranquillity of<br>soul, I attained to this success that thou seest. I shall not have to<br>come to this world again (after my departure hence). Verily, till I<br>attain to absorption into eternal Brahman, till, in fact, the final<br>dissolution of the universe, I shall look on those happy ends that will<br>be mine, and on those beings that constitute this universe.[9] Having<br>acquired this excellent success, I shall, after departing from this<br>world, proceed, to what is above it (i.e., Satyaloka) and thence to what<br>is higher (i.e., absorption into Brahman). Verily, I shall attain to the<br>condition, which is unmanifest aspect of Brahman. Let no doubt be thine<br>as regards this. O scorcher of foes, I shall not return to this world of<br>mortal creatures. O thou of great wisdom, I have become gratified with<br>thee. Tell me what I shall do for thee. The time has come for the<br>accomplishment of that purpose for which thou hast come hither. Verily, I<br>know that object for which thou hast sought me. I shall soon depart from<br>this world. Hence it is that I have given thee this hint. O thou of great<br>wisdom and experience, I have been highly gratified with thee for thy<br>behaviour. Do thou question me. I shall discourse on what is beneficial<br>to thee, agreeably to thy desire. I think thy intelligence is great.<br>Indeed, I applaud it much, for it was with the aid of that intelligence<br>that thou wert able to recognise me. Surely, O Kasyapa, thou art<br>possessed of great intelligence.'
