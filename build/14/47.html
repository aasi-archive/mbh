                            "Brahmana said. 'The ancients who were utterers of certain truth, say<br>that Renunciation is penance. Brahmanas, dwelling in that which has<br>Brahman for its origin, understand Knowledge to be high Brahman.[143]<br>Brahman is very far off, and its attainments depends upon a knowledge of<br>the Vedas. It is free from all pairs of opposites, it is divested of all<br>qualities; it is eternal; it is endued with unthinkable qualities: it is<br>supreme. It is by knowledge and penance that those endued with wisdom<br>behold that which is the highest. Verily, they that are of untainted<br>minds, that are cleansed of every sin, and that have transcended all<br>passion and darkness (succeed in beholding it). They who are always<br>devoted to renunciation, and who are conversant with the Vedas, succeed<br>in attaining to the supreme Lord who is identical with the path of<br>happiness and peace, by the aid of penance. Penance, it has been said, is<br>light. Conduct leads to piety. Knowledge is said to be the highest.<br>Renunciation is the best penance. He who understands self through<br>accurate determination of all topics, which is unperturbed, which is<br>identical with Knowledge, and which resides in all entities, succeeds in<br>going everywhere. The learned man who beholds association, and<br>dissociation, and unity in diversity, is released from misery. He who<br>never desires for anything, who despises nothing, becomes eligible, even<br>when dwelling in this world, for assimilation with Brahman. He who is<br>conversant with the truths about qualities of Pradhana, and understands<br>the Pradhana as existing in all entities who is free from mineness and<br>egoism, without doubt becomes emancipated. He who is freed from all pairs<br>of opposites, who does not bend his head to any body, who has transcended<br>the rites of Swadha, succeeds by the aid of tranquillity alone in<br>attaining to that which is free from pairs of opposites, which is<br>eternal, and which is divested of qualities. Abandoning all action, good<br>or bad, developed from qualities, and casting off both truth and<br>falsehood, a creature, without doubt, becomes emancipated. Having the<br>unmanifest for the seed of its origin, with the understanding for its<br>trunk, with the great principle of egoism for its assemblage of boughs,<br>with the senses for the cavities of its little sprouts, with the (five)<br>great elements for its large branches, the objects of the senses for its<br>smaller branches, with leaves that are ever present, with flowers that<br>always adorn it and with fruits both agreeable and disagreeable always<br>produced, is the eternal tree of Brahman which forms the support of all<br>creatures. Cutting and piercing that tree with knowledge of truth as the<br>sword, the man of wisdom, abandoning the bonds which are made of<br>attachment and which cause birth, decrepitude and death, and freeing<br>himself from mineness and egoism, without doubt, becomes emancipated.<br>These are the two birds, which are immutable, which are friends, and<br>which should be known as unintelligent. That other who is different from<br>these two is called the Intelligent. When the inner self, which is<br>destitute of knowledge of nature, which is (as it were) unintelligent,<br>becomes conversant with that which is above nature, then, understanding<br>the Kshetra, and endued with an intelligence that transcends all<br>qualities and apprehends everything, one becomes released from all sins.'"
