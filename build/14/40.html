                            "Brahmana said, 'From the unmanifest first sprang Mahat (the Great Soul)<br>endued with great intelligence, the source of all the qualities. That is<br>said to be the first creation. The Great Soul is signified by these<br>synonymous words&#8212;the Great Soul, Intelligence, Vishnu, Jishnu, Sambhu of<br>great valour, the Understanding, the means of acquiring knowledge, the<br>means of perception, as also fame, courage, and memory. Knowing this, a<br>learned Brahmana has never to encounter delusion. It has hands and feet<br>on every side, it has ears on every side. It stands, pervading everything<br>in the universe. Of great power, that Being is stationed in the heart of<br>all. Minuteness, Lightness and Affluence, are his. He is the lord of all,<br>and identical with effulgence, and knows not decay. In Him are all those<br>who comprehend the nature of the understanding, all those who are devoted<br>to goodness of disposition, all those who practise meditation, who are<br>always devoted to Yoga, who are firm in truth, who have subdued their<br>senses, who are possessed of knowledge, who are freed from cupidity, who<br>have conquered wrath, who are of cheerful hearts, who are endued with<br>wisdom, who are liberated from ideas of meum (and teum), and who are<br>devoid of egoism. All these, freed from every kind of attachment, attain<br>to the status of Greatness. That person who understands that holy and<br>high goal, viz., the Great Soul, becomes freed from delusion. The<br>self-born Vishnu becomes the Lord in the primary creations. He who thus<br>knows the Lord lying in the cave, the Supreme, Ancient Being, of<br>universal form, the golden one, the highest goal of all persons endued<br>with understanding,&#8212;that intelligent man lives, transcending the<br>understanding.'"
