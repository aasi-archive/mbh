                            "Vasudeva said, "O scion of Bharata's race, salvation is not attained by<br>foregoing the external things (like kingdom, etc), it is only attained by<br>giving up things which pander to the flesh (body). The virtue and<br>happiness which are attainable by the person who has renounced only the<br>external objects, but who is at the same time engrossed by passions and<br>weakness of the flesh, let these be the portion of our enemies. The word<br>with two letters is Mrit-yu (death of the soul or perdition), and the<br>word with three letters is Sas-wa-ta (Brahman) or the eternal spirit. The<br>consciousness that this or that thing is mine, or the state of being<br>addicted to worldly objects is Mrityu and the absence of that feeling is<br>Saswatam. And these two, Brahman and Mrityu, O king, have their seats in<br>the souls of all creatures, and remaining unseen, they, without doubt,<br>wage war with each other. And if, O Bharata, it be true that no creature<br>is ever destroyed, then one doth not make oneself guilty of the death of<br>a creature by piercing (destroying) its body. What matters the world to a<br>man, if having acquired the sovereignty of the whole earth with its<br>mobile and immobile creation, he does not become attached to it, or<br>engrossed in its enjoyment. But the man who having renounced the world,<br>has taken to the life of the recluse in the forest, living on wild roots<br>and edibles, if such a man, O son of Pritha, has a craving for the good<br>things of the world, and is addicted to them, he may be said to bear<br>Mrityu (death) in his mouth. Do thou, O Bharata, watch and observe the<br>character of thy external and internal enemies, (by means of thy<br>spiritual vision), And the man who is able to perceive the nature of the<br>eternal reality is able to overreach the influence of the great fear<br>(perdition). Men do not look with approbation upon the conduct of those<br>who are engrossed in worldly desires and there is no act without having a<br>desire (at its root) and all (Kama) desires are, as it were, the limbs<br>(offshoots) of the mind. Therefore, wise men knowing this subjugate their<br>desires. The Yogi who holds communion with the Supreme Spirit, knows Yoga<br>to be the perfect way (to salvation) by reason of the practices of his<br>many former births. And remembering that, what the soul desires, is not<br>conducive to piety and virtue, but that the suppression of the desires is<br>at the root of all true virtue, such men do not engage in the practice of<br>charity, Vedic learning, asceticism and Vedic rites whose object is<br>attainment of worldly prosperity, ceremonies, sacrifices, religious rules<br>and meditation, with the motive of securing any advantage thereby. By way<br>of illustration of this truth, the sages versed in ancient lore, recite<br>these Gathas called by the name of Kamagita, do thou O Yudhishthira,<br>listen to the recital of them in detail. (Kama says) No creature is able<br>to destroy me without resorting to the proper methods (viz., subjugating<br>of all desires and practice of Yoga etc.) If a man knowing my power,<br>strive to destroy me by muttering prayers etc., I prevail over him by<br>deluding him with the belief that I am the subjective ego within him. If<br>he wish to destroy me by means of sacrifices with many presents, I<br>deceive him by appearing in his mind as a most virtuous creature amongst<br>the mobile creation, and if he wish to annihilate me by mastering the<br>Vedas and Vedangas, I over reach him by seeming to his mind to be the<br>soul of virtue amongst the immobile creation. And if the man whose<br>strength lies in truth, desire to overcome me by patience, I appear to<br>him as his mind, and thus he does not perceive my existence, and if the<br>man of austere religious practices, desire to destroy me by means of<br>asceticism, I appear in the guise of asceticism in his mind, and thus he<br>is prevented from knowing me, and the man of learning, who with the<br>object of attaining salvation desires to destroy me, I frolic and laugh<br>in the face of such a man intent on salvation. I am the everlasting one<br>without a compeer, whom no creature can kill or destroy. For this reason<br>thou too, O prince, divert thy desires (Kama) to Virtue, so that, by this<br>means, thou mayst attain what is well for thee. Do thou therefore make<br>preparations for the due performance of the horse sacrifice with<br>presents, and various other sacrifices of great splendour, and<br>accompanied with presents. Let not therefore grief overpower thee again,<br>on beholding thy friends lying slain on the battlefield. Thou canst not<br>see the men slain in this battle alive again. Therefore shouldst thou<br>perform magnificent sacrifices with presents, so that thou mayst attain<br>fame in this world, and reach the perfect way (hereafter)."
