                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed by Krishna, Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Dharma, endued with great intelligence, saluted Vyasa and said these<br>words: 'Do thou cause me to be initiated when the proper hour, as thou<br>truly knowest, comes for that rite. This my sacrifice is entirely<br>dependent on thee.'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'Myself, O son of Kunti, and Paila and Yajnavalkya, shall<br>without doubt, achieve every rite at the proper time. The rite of<br>initiating thee will be performed on the day of full moon belonging to<br>the month of Chaitra. Let all the necessaries of the sacrifice, O<br>foremost of men, be got ready. Let Sutas well-versed in the science of<br>horses, and let Brahmanas also possessed of the same lore, select, after<br>examination, a worthy horse in order that thy sacrifice maybe completed.<br>Loosening the animal according to the injunctions of the scriptures, let<br>him wander over the whole Earth with her belt of seas, displaying thy<br>blazing glory, O king!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed (by the Rishi), Yudhishthira,<br>the son of Pandu, that lord of Earth, answered,&#8212;'So be it!'&#8212;and then, O<br>monarch, he accomplished all that that utterer of Brahma had directed.<br>All the articles necessary for the sacrifice, O king, were duly procured.<br>The royal son of Dharma, possessed of immeasurable soul, having procured<br>all the necessaries, informed the Island-born Krishna of it. Then Vyasa<br>of great energy said unto the royal son of Dharma,&#8212;'As regards<br>ourselves, we are all prepared to initiate thee in view of the sacrifice.<br>Let the Sphya and the Kurcha and all the other articles that, O thou of<br>Kuru's race, may be needed for thy sacrifice, be made of gold.[189] Let<br>the horse also be loosened today, for roaming on the Earth, agreeably to<br>the ordinances of the scriptures. Let the animal, duly protected, wander<br>over the Earth.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Let arrangements be made by thee, O regenerate one,<br>about loosening this horse for enabling it to wander over the Earth at<br>its will. It behoveth thee, O ascetic, to say who will protect this steed<br>while roaming over the Earth freely according to its will.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed (by king Yudhishthira), O<br>monarch, the Island-born Krishna said,&#8212;'He who is born after Bhimasena,<br>who is the foremost of all bowmen, who is called Jishnu, who is endued<br>with great patience and capable of overcoming all resistance,&#8212;he will<br>protect the horse. That destroyer of the Nivatakavachas is competent to<br>conquer the whole Earth. In him are all celestial weapons. His body is<br>like that of a celestial in its powers of endurance. His bow and quivers<br>are celestial. Even he will follow this horse.&#8212;He is well versed in both<br>Religion and wealth. He is a master of all the sciences. O foremost of<br>kings, he will agreeably to the scriptures, cause the steed to roam and<br>graze at its will. This mighty-armed prince, of dark complexion, is<br>endued with eyes resembling the petals of the lotus. That hero, the<br>father of Abhimanyu, will protect the steed. Bhimasena also is endued<br>with great energy. The son of Kunti is possessed of immeasurable might.<br>He is competent to protect the kingdom, aided by Nakula, O monarch.<br>Possessed of great intelligence and fame, Sahadeva will, O thou of Kuru's<br>race, duly attend to all the relatives that have been invited to thy<br>capital.' Thus addressed by the Rishi, that perpetuator of Kuru's race,<br>viz., Yudhishthira, accomplished every injunction duly and appointed<br>Phalguna to attend to the horse.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Come, O Arjuna, let the horse, O hero, be protected<br>by thee. Thou alone art competent to protect it, and none else. Those<br>kings, O mighty-armed hero, who will come forward to encounter thee, try,<br>O sinless one, to avoid battles with them to the best of thy power. Thou<br>shouldst also invite them all to this sacrifice of mine. Indeed, O<br>mighty-armed one go forth but try to establish friendly relations with<br>them.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The righteous-souled king Yudhishthira, having<br>said so unto his brother Savyasachin, commanded Bhima and Nakula to<br>protect the city. With the permission of king Dhritarashtra, Yudhishthira<br>then set Sahadeva, that foremost of warriors, to wait upon all the<br>invited guests.'"
