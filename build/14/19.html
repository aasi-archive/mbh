                            "&#8212;The Brahmana said, 'He who becomes absorbed in the one receptacle (of<br>all things), freeing himself from even the thought of his own identity<br>with all things,&#8212;indeed, ceasing to think of even his own<br>existence,&#8212;gradually casting off one after another, will succeed in<br>crossing his bonds.[24] That man who is the friend of all, who endures<br>all, who is attached to tranquillity, who has conquered all his senses,<br>who is divested of fear and wrath, and who is of restrained soul.<br>succeeds in emancipating himself. He who behaves towards all creatures as<br>towards himself, who is restrained, pure, free from vanity and divested<br>of egoism is regarded as emancipated from everything. He also is<br>emancipated who looks with an equal eye upon life and death, pleasure and<br>pain, gain and loss, agreeable and disagreeable. He is in every way<br>emancipated who does not covet what belongs to others, who never<br>disregards any body, who transcends all pairs of opposites, and whose<br>soul is free from attachment. He is emancipated who has no enemy, no<br>kinsman, and no child, who has cast off religion, wealth, and pleasure,<br>and who is freed from desire or cupidity. He becomes emancipated who<br>acquires neither merit nor demerit, who casts off the merits and demerits<br>accumulated in previous births, who wastes the elements of his body for<br>attaining to a tranquillised soul, and who transcends all pairs of<br>opposites. He who abstains from all acts, who is free from desire or<br>cupidity, who looks upon the universe as unenduring or as like an<br>Aswattha tree, ever endued with birth, death and decrepitude, whose<br>understanding is fixed on renunciation, and whose eyes are always<br>directed towards his own faults, soon succeeds in emancipating himself<br>from the bonds that bind him.[25] He that sees his soul void of smell, of<br>taste and touch, of sound, of belongings, of vision, and unknowable,<br>becomes emancipated.[26] He who sees his soul devoid of the attributes of<br>the five elements to be without form and cause, to be really destitute of<br>attributes though enjoying them, becomes emancipated.[27] Abandoning,<br>with the aid of the understanding, all purposes relating to body and<br>mind, one gradually attains to cessation of separate existence, like a<br>fire unfed with fuel.[28] One who is freed from all impressions, who<br>transcends all pairs of opposites, who is destitute of all belongings,<br>and who uses all his senses under the guidance of penances, becomes<br>emancipated.[29] Having become freed from all impressions, one then<br>attains to Brahma which is Eternal and supreme, and tranquil, and stable,<br>and enduring, and indestructible. After this I shall declare the science<br>of Yoga to which there is nothing superior, and how Yogins, by<br>concentration, behold the perfect soul.[30] I shall declare the<br>instructions regarding it duly. Do thou learn from me those doors by<br>which directing the soul within the body one beholds that which is<br>without beginning and end.[31] Withdrawing the senses from their objects,<br>one should fix the mind upon the soul; having previously undergone the<br>severest austerities, one should practise that concentration of mind<br>which leads to Emancipation.[32] Observant of penances and always<br>practising concentration of mind, the learned Brahmana, endued with<br>intelligence, should observe the precepts of the science of Yoga,<br>beholding the soul in the body. If the good man succeeds in concentrating<br>the mind on the soul, he then, habituated to exclusive meditation,<br>beholds the Supreme soul in his own soul. Self-restrained, and always<br>concentrated, and with all his senses completely conquered, the man of<br>cleansed soul, in consequence of such complete concentration of mind,<br>succeeds in beholding the soul by the soul. As a person beholding some<br>unseen individual in a dream recognises him, saying,&#8212;This is he,&#8212;when<br>he sees him after waking, after the same manner the good man having seen<br>the Supreme Soul in the deep contemplation of Samadhi recognises it upon<br>waking from Samadhi.[33] As one beholds the fibrous pith after extracting<br>it from a blade of the Saccharum Munja, even so the Yogin beholds the<br>soul, extracting it from the body. The body has been called the Saccharum<br>Munja, and the fibrous pith is said to stand for the soul. This is the<br>excellent illustration propounded by persons conversant with Yoga. When<br>the bearer of a body adequately beholds the soul in Yoga, he then has no<br>one that is master over him, for he then becomes the lord of the three<br>worlds.[34] He succeeds in assuming diverse bodies according as he<br>wishes. Turning away decrepitude and death, he neither grieves nor<br>exults. The self-restrained man, concentrated in Yoga, can create (for<br>himself) the godship of the very gods. Casting off his transient body he<br>attains to immutable Brahma.[35] No fear springs up in him at even the<br>sight of all creatures falling victims to destruction (before his eyes).<br>When all creatures are afflicted,&#8212;he can never be afflicted by any one.<br>Devoid of desire and possessed of a tranquil mind, the person in Yoga is<br>never shaken by pain and sorrow and fear, the terrible effects that flow<br>from attachment and affection. Weapons never pierce him; death does not<br>exist for him. Nowhere in the world can be seen any one that is happier<br>than he. Having adequately concentrated his soul, he lives steadily on<br>himself. Turning off decrepitude and pain and pleasure, he sleeps in<br>comfort. Casting off this human body he attains to (other) forms<br>according to his pleasure. While one is enjoying the sovereignty that<br>Yoga bestows, one should never fall away from devotion to Yoga.[36] When<br>one, after adequate devotion to Yoga, beholds the Soul in oneself, one<br>then ceases to have any regard for even him of a hundred sacrifices<br>(Indra).[37] Hear now how one, habituating oneself to exclusive<br>meditation, succeeds in attaining to Yoga. Thinking of that point of the<br>compass which has the Sun behind it, the mind should be fixed, not<br>outside, but in the interior of that mansion in which one may happen to<br>live. Residing within that mansion, the mind should then, with all its<br>outward and inward (operations), behold in that particular room in which<br>one may stay. At that time when, having deeply meditated, one beholds the<br>All (viz., Brahman, the Soul of the universe), there is then nothing<br>external to Brahman where the mind may dwell. Restraining all the senses<br>in a forest that is free from noise and that is uninhabited, with mind<br>fixed thereon, one should meditate on the All (or universal Brahman) both<br>outside and inside one's body. One should meditate on the teeth, the<br>palate, the tongue, the throat, the neck likewise; one should also<br>meditate on the heart and the ligatures of the heart![38]<br><br>"The Brahmana continued, 'Thus addressed by me, that intelligent<br>disciple, O slayer of Madhu, once more asked me about this religion of<br>Emancipation that is so difficult to explain. How does this food that is<br>eaten from time to time become digested in the stomach? How does it<br>become transformed into juice? How, again, into blood? How does it<br>nourish the flesh, the marrow, the sinews, the bones? How do all these<br>limbs of embodied creatures grow? How does the strength grow of the<br>growing man? How occurs the escape of all such elements as are not<br>nutritive, and of all impurities separately? How does this one inhale and<br>again, exhale? Staying upon what particular part does the Soul dwell in<br>the body? How does Jiva, exerting himself, bear the body? Of what colour<br>and of what kind is the body in which he dwells again (leaving a<br>particular body)? O holy one, it behoveth thee to tell me all this<br>accurately, O sinless one,&#8212;even thus was I interrogated by that learned<br>Brahmana, O Madhava. I replied unto him, O thou of mighty arms, after the<br>manner I myself had heard, O chastiser of all foes. As one placing some<br>precious object in one's store-room should keep one's mind on it, so,<br>placing the mind within one's own body, one should then, restraining all<br>the senses, seek after the Soul, avoiding all heedlessness. One would,<br>becoming always assiduous in this way and gratified with one's own self,<br>within a very short time attain to that Brahma by beholding which one<br>would become conversant with Pradhana.[39] He is not capable of being<br>seized by the eye; nor even by all the senses.[40] It is only with the<br>lamp of the mind that great Soul can be seen. He has hands and feet on<br>all sides; he has ears on all sides; he dwells, pervading all things in<br>the world.[41] Jiva beholds the Soul as extracted from the body (like the<br>stalk from a blade of Saccharum Munja, when knowledge comes). Then<br>casting off Brahma as invested with form, by holding the mind in the<br>body, he beholds Brahma as freed from all attributes.[42] He sees the<br>Soul with his mind, smiling as it were at the time. Depending upon that<br>Brahma, he then attains to Emancipation in me.[43] O foremost of<br>regenerate ones, all this mystery has now been declared by me. I ask thy<br>permission, for I shall leave this spot. Do thou (also) go withersoever<br>thou pleasest. Thus addressed by me, O Krishna, on that occasion, that<br>disciple of mine, endued with austere penances, that Brahmana of rigid<br>vows, went away according to his pleasure.<br><br>"Vasudeva continued, 'That best of Brahmanas, O son of Pritha, having<br>said these words unto me, on that occasion, properly relating to the<br>religion of Emancipation, disappeared then and there. Has this discourse<br>been heard by thee, O son of Pritha, with mind directed solely towards<br>it? Even this was what thou didst hear on that occasion while thou wert<br>on thy car. It is my opinion, O son of Pritha, that this is difficult of<br>being comprehended by one whose understanding is confused, or who has<br>acquired no wisdom by study, or who eats food incompatible with his body,<br>or whose Soul is not purified.[44] O chief of Bharata's race, this is a<br>great mystery among the deities that has been declared (to thee). At no<br>time or place, O son of Pritha, has this been heard by man in this world.<br>O sinless one, no other man than thyself is deserving of hearing it. It<br>is not, at this time, capable of being easily understood by one whose<br>inner soul is confused. The world of the deities is filled, O son of<br>Kunti, with those who follow the religion of actions. The cessation of<br>the mortal form (by practising the religion of inaction) is not agreeable<br>to the deities.[45] That goal, O son of Pritha, is the highest which is<br>constituted by eternal Brahman where one, casting off the body, attains<br>to immortality and becomes always happy. By adhering to this religion,<br>even they who axe of sinful birth, such as women and Vaisyas and Sudras,<br>attain to the highest goal. What need be said then, O son of Pritha, of<br>Brahmanas and Kshatriyas possessed of great learning, always devoted to<br>the duties of their own orders and who are intent on (the acquisition of)<br>the region of Brahma? This has been laid down with the reasons (on which<br>it rests); and also the means for its acquisition; and its complete<br>attainment and fruit, viz., Emancipation and the ascertainment of the<br>truth regarding pain. O chief of Bharata's race, there is nothing else<br>that is fraught with happiness greater than this. That mortal, O son of<br>Pandu, who, endued with intelligence, and faith, and prowess, renounces<br>as unsubstantial what is regarded as substantial by the world, succeeds<br>within a short time in obtaining the Supreme by these means. This is all<br>that is to be said,&#8212;there is nothing else that is higher than this. Yoga<br>takes place in his case, O son of Pritha, who devotes himself to its<br>constant practice for a period of six months.'"
