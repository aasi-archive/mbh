                            "Yudhishthira said, 'What men, O chief of Bharata's race, are worthy of<br>reverent homage in the three worlds? Tell me this in detail verily. I am<br>never satiated with hearing thee discourse on these topics.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative of the<br>discourse between Narada and Vasudeva. Beholding Narada on one occasion<br>worshipping many foremost of Brahmanas with joined hands, Kesava<br>addressed him saying, Whom dost thou worship? Whom amongst these<br>Brahmanas, O holy one dost thou worship with so great reverence? If it is<br>a matter that I can heard of, I then wish to hear it. Do, O foremost of<br>righteous men, tell me this!'[251]<br><br>"Narada said, 'Hear, O Govinda, as to who those are whom I am<br>worshipping, O grinder of foes. Who else is there in this world that so<br>much deserves to hear this? I worship the Brahmanas, O puissant one, who<br>constantly worship Varuna and Vayu and Aditya and Parjanya and the deity<br>of Fire, and Sthanu and Skanda and Lakshmi and Vishnu and the Brahmanas,<br>and the lord of speech, and Chandramas, and the Waters and Earth and the<br>goddess Saraswati. O tiger of Vrishni's race, I always worship those<br>Brahmanas that are endued with penances, that are conversant with the<br>Vedas, that are always devoted to Vedic study, and that are possessed of<br>high worth. O puissant one, I bow down my head unto those persons who are<br>freed from boastfulness, who discharge, with an empty stomach, the rites<br>in honour of the deities, who are always contented with what they have<br>and who are endued with forgiveness. I worship them, O Yadava, that are<br>performers of sacrifices, that are of a forgiving disposition, and self<br>restrained, that are masters of their own senses, that worship truth and<br>righteousness, and that give away land and kine unto good Brahmanas.[252]<br>I bow unto them, O Yadava, that are devoted to the observance of<br>penances, that dwell in forests, that subsist upon fruits and roots, that<br>never store anything for the morrow, and that are observant of all the<br>acts and rites laid down in the scriptures. I bow unto them, O Yadava,<br>that feed and cherish their servants, that are always hospitable to<br>guests, and that eat only the remnants of what is offered to the deities.<br>I worship them that have become irresistible by studying the Vedas, that<br>are eloquent in discoursing on the scriptures, that are observant of the<br>vow of Brahmacharyya, and that are always devoted to the duties of<br>officiating at the sacrifices of others and of teaching disciples. I<br>worship them that are endued with compassion towards all creatures, and<br>that study the Vedas till noon (i.e. till their backs are heated by the<br>sun). I bow unto them, O Yadava, that strive to obtain the grace of their<br>preceptors, that labour in the acquisition of their Vedas, that are firm<br>in the observance of vows, that wait, with dutiful obedience, upon their<br>preceptors and seniors, and that are free from malice and envy. I bow<br>unto them, O Yadava, that are observant of excellent vows, that practice<br>taciturnity, that have knowledge of Brahman, that are firm in truth, that<br>are givers of libations of clarified butter and oblations of meat. I bow<br>to them, O Yadava, that subsist upon eleemosynary alms, that are<br>emaciated for want of adequate food and drink, that have lived in the<br>abodes of their preceptors, that are averse to and destitute of all<br>enjoyments, and that are poor in the goods of this Earth. I bow unto<br>them, O Yadava, that have no affection for things of this Earth, that<br>have no quarrels to wage with others, that do not clothe themselves, that<br>have no wants, that have become irresistible through the acquisition of<br>the Vedas, that are eloquent in the exposition of righteousness, and that<br>are utterers of Brahma, I bow unto them that are devoted to the practice<br>of the duty of compassion towards all creatures, that are firm in the<br>observance of truth, that are self-restrained, and that are peaceful in<br>their behaviour. I bow unto them, O Yadava, that are devoted to the<br>worship of deities and guests, that are observant of the domestic mode of<br>life, and that follow the practice of pigeons in the matter of their<br>subsistence.[253] I always bow unto those persons whose aggregate of<br>three exists, without being weakened, in all their acts, and who are<br>observant of truth and righteous behaviour,[254] I bow unto them, O<br>Kesava, that are conversant with Brahma, that are endued with knowledge<br>of the Vedas, that are attentive to the aggregate of three, that are free<br>from cupidity, and that are righteous in their behaviour. I bow unto<br>them, O Madhava, that subsist upon water only, or upon air alone, or upon<br>the remnants of the food that is offered to deities and guests, and that<br>are observant of diverse kinds of excellent vows. I always worship them<br>that have no spouses (in consequence of the vow of celibacy they<br>observe), that have spouses and the domestic fire (in consequence of the<br>domestic mode of life they lead), that are the refuge of the Vedas, and<br>that are the refuge of all creatures in the universe (in consequence of<br>the compassion they feel towards them). I always bow unto those Rishis, O<br>Krishna, that are the creators of the universe, that are the elders of<br>the universe, that are the eldest members of the race or the family, that<br>are dispellers of the darkness of ignorance, and that are the best of all<br>persons in the universe (for righteousness of behaviour and knowledge of<br>the scriptures). For these reasons, do thou also, O scion of Vrishni's<br>race, worship every day those regenerate persons of whom I speak.<br>Deserving as they are of reverent worship, they will when worshipped,<br>confer happiness on thee, O sinless one. Those persons of whom I speak<br>are always givers of happiness in this world as well as in the next.<br>Reverenced by all, they move about in this world, and if worshipped by<br>thee are sure to grant thee happiness. They who are hospitable to all<br>persons that come unto them as guests, and who are always devoted to<br>Brahmanas and kine, as also to truth (in speech and behaviour), succeed<br>in crossing all calamities and obstacles. They who are always devoted to<br>peacefulness of behaviour, as also they who are freed from malice and<br>envy, and they who are always attentive to the study of the Vedas,<br>succeed in crossing all calamities and obstacles. They who bow unto all<br>the deities (without showing a preference for any and thereby proving<br>their tolerance), they who betake themselves to one Veda as their refuge,<br>they who are possessed of faith and are self-restrained, succeed in<br>crossing all calamities and obstacles. They who worship the foremost of<br>Brahmanas with reverence and are firm in the observance of excellent vows<br>and practise the virtue of charity, succeed in crossing all calamities<br>and obstacles. They who are engaged in the practice of penances, they who<br>are always observant of the vow of celibacy, and they whose souls have<br>been cleansed by penances, succeed in crossing all calamities and<br>obstacles. They who are devoted to the worship of the deities and guests<br>and dependants, as also of the Pitris, and they who eat the remnant of<br>the food that is offered to deities, Pitris, guests and dependants,<br>succeed in crossing all calamities and obstacles. They who, having<br>ignited the domestic fire, duly keep it burning and worship it with<br>reverence and they who have duly poured libations (to the deities) in<br>Soma-sacrifices, succeed in crossing all calamities and obstacles. They<br>who behave as they should towards their mothers and fathers and<br>preceptors and other seniors even as thou, O tiger among the Vrishnis,<br>dost behave, succeed in crossing all calamities and obstacles&#8212;Having<br>said these words, the celestial Rishi ceased speaking.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued. 'For these reasons, do thou also, O son of Kunti,<br>always worship with reverence the deities, the Pitris, the Brahmanas, and<br>guests arrived at thy mansion and as the consequence of such conduct thou<br>art sure to attain to a desirable end!'"
