                            "Bhishma said, 'Thus addressed by Vyasa, Maitreya, who was a worshipper<br>of acts, who had been born in a race endued with great prosperity, who<br>was wise and possessed of great learning said unto him these words'.<br><br>"Maitreya said, 'O thou of great wisdom, without doubt it is as thou hast<br>said, O puissant one, with thy permission I desire to say something.'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'Whatever thou wishest to say, O Maitreya, do thou say, O<br>man of great wisdom, for I wish to hear thee.<br><br>"Maitreya said. 'Thy words on the subject of Gift are faultless and pure.<br>Without doubt, thy soul has been cleansed by knowledge and penances. In<br>consequence of thy soul being cleansed, even this is the great advantage<br>I reap from it. With the aid of my understanding I see that thou art<br>endued with high penances. As regards ourselves we succeed in acquiring<br>prosperity through only a sight of personages like thee I think, that is<br>due to thy grace and flows from the nature of my own acts.[535] Penances,<br>knowledge of the Vedas, and birth in a pure race,&#8212;these are the causes<br>of the status which one acquires of a Brahmana. When one has these three<br>attributes, then does he come to be called a regenerate person. If the<br>Brahmana be gratified, the Pitris and the deities are also gratified.<br>There is nothing superior to a Brahmana possessed of Vedic lore. Without<br>the Brahmana, all would be darkness. Nothing would be known. The four<br>orders would not exist. The distinction between Righteousness and<br>Unrighteousness. Truth and Falsehood, would cease. On a well-tilled<br>field, an abundant harvest can be reaped. Even so, one may reap great<br>merit by making gifts unto a Brahmana possessed of great learning. If<br>there were no Brahmanas endued with Vedic lore and good conduct for<br>accepting gifts, the wealth possessed by wealthy people would be useless.<br>The ignorant Brahmana, by eating the food that is offered to him,<br>destroys what he eats (for it produces no merit to him who gives it). The<br>food that is eaten also destroys the eater (for the eater incurs sin by<br>eating what is offered to him). That ought to be properly termed an<br>eatable which is given away to a deserving man, in all other cases, he<br>that takes it makes the donor's gift thrown away and the receiver is<br>likewise ruined for his improperly accepting it. The Brahmana possessed<br>of learning becomes the subjugator of the food that he eats. Having eaten<br>it, he begets other food. The ignorant who eats the food offered to him<br>loses his right to the children he begets, for the latter become his<br>whose food has enabled the progenitor to beget them. Even this is the<br>subtle fault that attaches to persons eating other people's food when<br>they have not the puissance to win that food. The merit which the giver<br>acquires by making the gift, is equal to what the taker acquires by<br>accepting the food. Both the giver and the acceptor depend equally upon<br>each other. Even this is what the Rishis have said. There where Brahmanas<br>exist, possessed of Vedic lore and conduct, people are enabled to earn<br>the sacred fruits of gifts and to enjoy them both here and hereafter.<br>Those men who are of pure lineage, who are exceedingly devoted to<br>penances, and who make gifts, and study the Vedas, are regarded as worthy<br>of the most reverent worship. It is those good men that have chalked out<br>the path by treading on which one does not become stupefied. It is those<br>men that are the leaders of others to heaven. They are the men who bear<br>on their shoulders the burden of sacrifices and live for eternity."
