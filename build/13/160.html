                            "Yudhishthira said, 'It behoveth thee, O slayer of Madhu, to expound to<br>me that knowledge which thou hast acquired through the grace of Durvasa!<br>O foremost of all persons endued with intelligence, I desire to know<br>everything about the high blessedness and all the names of that<br>high-souled one truly and in detail![616]<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'I shall recite to thee the good that I have acquired and<br>the fame that I have won through the grace of that high-souled one.<br>Verily, I shall discourse to thee on the topic, after having bowed unto<br>Kapardin. O king, listen to me as I recite to thee that Sata-rudriya<br>which I repeat; with restrained senses, every morning after rising from<br>bed. The great lord of all creatures, viz., the Grandsire Brahman<br>himself, endued with wealth of penances, composed those Mantras, after<br>having observed especial penances for some time. O sire it is Sankara who<br>created all the creatures in the universe, mobile and immobile. There is<br>no being that is higher, O monarch, than Mahadeva. Verily, he is the<br>highest of all beings in the three worlds. There is no one who is capable<br>of standing before that high-souled Being. Indeed, there is no Being in<br>the three worlds that can be regarded as his equal. When he stands,<br>filled with rage, on the field of battle, the very odour of his body<br>deprives all foes of consciousness and they that are not slain tremble<br>and fall down. His roars are terrible, resembling those of the clouds.<br>Hearing those roars in battle, the very hearts of the deities break in<br>twain. When the wielder of Pinaka becomes angry and assuming a terrible<br>form merely casts his eye upon deity, Asura, Gandharva, or snake, that<br>individual fails to obtain peace of mind by taking shelter in the<br>recesses of even a mountain-cave. When that lord of all creatures, viz.,<br>Daksha, desirous of performing a sacrifice, spread his sacrifice out, the<br>dauntless Bhava, giving way to wrath (at Daksha's slight of him), pierced<br>(the embodied) sacrifice, shooting his shaft from his terrible bow, he<br>roared aloud. Indeed, when Maheswara became angry and suddenly pierced<br>with his shaft the embodied form of sacrifice, the deities become filled<br>with grief, losing happiness and tranquillity of heart. In consequence of<br>the twang of his bow-string the whole universe became agitated. The<br>deities and the Asuras, O son of Pritha, all became cheerless and<br>stupefied. The ocean rolled in agitation and the earth trembled to her<br>centre. The hills and mountains began to move from their bases and ran on<br>every side. The vault of the welkin became cracked. All the worlds became<br>enveloped in gloom. Nothing could be seen. The light of all the<br>luminaries became darkened, along with that of the sun himself, O<br>Bharata! The great Rishis, penetrated with fear and desirous of doing<br>good to themselves and the universe, performed the usual rites of<br>propitiation and peace. Meanwhile, Rudra of terrible prowess rushed<br>against the deities. Filled with rage, he tore out the eyes of Bhaga.<br>Incensed with wrath, he assailed Pushan with his foot. He tore out the<br>teeth of that god as he sat employed in eating the large sacrificial ball<br>(called Purodasa). Trembling with fear, the deities bent their heads to<br>Sankara. Without being appeased, Rudra once more placed on his bow-string<br>a sharp and blazing arrow. Beholding his prowess, the deities and the<br>Rishis became all alarmed. Those foremost of gods began to pacify him!<br>Joining their hands in reverence, they began to recite the Sata-rudriya<br>Mantras. At last Maheswara, thus praised by the deities, became<br>gratified. The deities than assigned a large share (of the sacrificial<br>offerings) to him. Trembling with fear, O king, they sought his<br>protection. When Rudra became gratified, the embodiment of sacrifice,<br>which had been pierced in twain, became once more united. Whatever limbs<br>of his had been destroyed by the shafts of Mahadeva, became once more<br>whole and sound. The Asuras possessed of great energy had in days of yore<br>three cities in the firmament. One of these had been made of iron, one of<br>silver, and the third of gold. With all his weapons, Maghavat, the chief<br>of the deities, was unable to pierce those cities. Afflicted by the<br>Asuras, all the deities then sought the protection of the great Rudra.<br>Assembled together the high-souled deities addressed him, saying, 'O<br>Rudra, the Asuras threaten to exert their destructive influence in all<br>acts! Do thou slay the Daityas and destroy their city for the protection<br>of the three worlds, O giver of honours!' Thus addressed by them, he<br>replied, saying, 'So be it!' and then made Vishnu his excellent<br>shaft-head. He made the deity of fire his shaft-reed, and Surya's son<br>Yama the wings of that shaft. He made the Vedas his bow and the goddess<br>Savitri his excellent bow-string. And he made the Grandsire Brahma his<br>charioteer. Applying all these, he pierced the triple city of the Asuras<br>with that shaft of his, consisting of three Parvans and three<br>Salyas.[617] Indeed, O Bharata, the Asuras with their cities, were all<br>burnt by Rudra with that shaft of his whose complexion was like that of<br>the sun and whose energy resembled that of the fire which appears at the<br>end of the Yuga for consuming all things. Beholding that Mahadeva changed<br>into a child with five locks of hair lying on the lap of Parvati, the<br>latter asked the deities as to who he was. Seeing the child, Sakra became<br>suddenly filled with jealousy and wrath and resolved to kill him with his<br>thunder. The child, however, paralysed the arm, looking like a mace of<br>iron, of Indra with the thunderbolt in it. The deities all became<br>stupefied, and they could not understand that the child was the Lord of<br>universe. Verily, all of them along with the very Regents of the world,<br>found their intellects stupefied in the matter of that child who was none<br>else than the Supreme Being. Then the illustrious Grandsire Brahma,<br>reflecting with the aid of his penances, found out that that child was<br>the foremost of all Beings, the lord of Uma, Mahadeva of immeasurable<br>prowess. He then praised the Lord. The deities also began to hymn the<br>praises of both Uma and Rudra. The arm (which had been paralysed) of the<br>slayer of Vala then became restored to its former state. The Mahadeva,<br>taking birth as the Brahmana Durvasa of great energy, resided for a long<br>time at Dwaravati in my house. While residing in my abode he did diverse<br>acts of mischief. Though difficult of being borne, I bore them yet from<br>magnanimity of heart. He is Rudra; he is Shiva; he is Agni; he is Sarva;<br>he is the vanquisher of all; he is Indra, and Vayu, and the Aswins and<br>the god of lightning. He is Chandramas; he is Isana; he is Surya; he is<br>Varuna; he is Time; he is the Destroyer; he is Death; he is the Day and<br>the Night; he is the fortnight; he is the seasons; he is the two<br>twilights; he is the year. He is Dhatri and he is Vidhatri; and he is<br>Viswakarma; and he is conversant with all things. He is the cardinal<br>points of the compass and the subsidiary points also. Of universal form,<br>he is of immeasurable soul. The holy and illustrious Durvasa is of the<br>complexion of the celestials. He sometimes manifests himself singly;<br>sometimes divides himself into two portions; and sometimes exhibits<br>himself in many, a hundred thousand forms. Even such is Mahadeva. He is,<br>again, that god who is unborn. In even a hundred years one cannot exhaust<br>his merits by reciting them.'"
