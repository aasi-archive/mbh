                            "Chyavana said, 'I should certainly, O chief of men, tell you everything<br>about the circumstance for which, O monarch, I came hither for<br>exterminating thy race. This is well-known, O king, that the Kshatriyas<br>should always have the assistance of the sons of Bhrigu in the matter of<br>sacrifices. Through an irresistible decree of Destiny, the Kshatriyas and<br>the Bhargavas will fall out. The Kshatriyas, O king, will slay the<br>descendants of Bhrigu. Afflicted by an ordinance of fate, they will<br>exterminate the race of Bhrigu, not sparing even infants in their<br>mothers' wombs. There will then spring in Bhrigu's race a Rishi of the<br>name of Urva. Endued with great energy, he will in splendour certainly<br>resemble fire or the sun. He will cherish such wrath (upon hearing of the<br>extermination of his race) as will be sufficient to consume the three<br>worlds. He will be competent to reduce the whole earth with all her<br>mountains and forests into ashes. For a little while he will quell the<br>flames of that fiery rage, throwing it into the Mare's mouth that wanders<br>through the ocean. He will have a son of the name of Richika. The whole<br>science of arms, O sinless one, in its embodied form will come to him,<br>for the extermination of the entire Kshatriya race, through a decree of<br>Destiny. Receiving that science by inward light, he will, by<br>Yoga-puissance, communicate it to his son, the highly-blessed Jamadagni<br>of cleansed soul. That tiger of Bhrigu's race will bear that science in<br>his mind. O thou of righteous soul, Jamadagni will wed a girl, taking her<br>from thy race, for spreading its glory, O chief of the Bharatas. Having<br>obtained for wife the daughter of Gadhi and thy grand-daughter, O king<br>that great ascetic will beget a regenerate son endued with Kshatriya<br>accomplishments. In thy race will be born a son, a Kshatriya endued with<br>the virtues of a Brahmana. Possessed of great righteousness, he will be<br>the son of Gadhi. Known by the name of Viswamitra, he will in energy come<br>to be regarded as the equal of Vrihaspati himself, the preceptor of the<br>celestials. The illustrious Richika will grant this son to thy race, this<br>Kshatriya that will be endued with high penances. In the matter of this<br>exchange of sons, (viz., a Kshatriya son in the race of Bhrigu and a<br>Brahamana son in thy race) the cause will be two women. All this will<br>happen at the command of the grandsire. It will never be otherwise. Unto<br>one that is third in descent from thee, the status of Brahmanahood will<br>attach. Thou shalt become a relative (by marriage) of the Bhargavas.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Hearing these words of the high-souled ascetic<br>Chyavana, king Kusika became filled with joy, and made answer in the<br>following words, 'Indeed, O best of the Bharatas', he said, 'So be it!'<br>Endued with high energy, Chyavana once more addressed the king, and urged<br>him to accept a boon from himself. The king replied, 'Very well.' From<br>thee, O great ascetic, I shall obtain the fruition of my wish. Let my<br>race become invested with the status of Brahmanahood, and let it always<br>set its heart upon righteousness.' The ascetic Chyavana, thus solicited,<br>granted the king's prayer, and bidding farewell to the monarch, set out<br>on his intended tour to the sacred waters. I have now told thee<br>everything, O Bharata, relating to thy questions, viz., how the Bhrigus<br>and the Kusikas became connected with each other by marriage. Indeed, O<br>king, everything fell out as the Rishi Chyavana had said. The birth of<br>Rama (of Bhrigu's race) and of Viswamitra (of Kusika's race) happened in<br>the way that Chyavana had indicated.'"
