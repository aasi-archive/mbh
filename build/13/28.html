                            "Bhishma said, 'Thus addressed by Indra, Matanga of restrained vows and<br>well regulated soul, (without hearkening to the counsels of the chief of<br>the celestials), stood for a hundred years on one foot, O thou of<br>unfading glory. Sakra of great fame once more appeared before him and<br>addressing him, said,&#8212;The status of a Brahmana, O child, is<br>unattainable. Although thou covetest it, it is impossible for thee to<br>obtain it. O Matanga, by coveting that very high status thou art sure to<br>be destroyed. Do not, O son, betray such rashness. This cannot be a<br>righteous path for thee to follow. O thou of foolish understanding, it is<br>impossible for thee to obtain it in this world. Verily, by coveting that<br>which is unattainable, thou art sure to meet with destruction in no time.<br>I am repeatedly forbidding thee. By striving, however, to attain that<br>high status by the aid of thy penances, notwithstanding my repeated<br>admonition, thou art sure to meet with destruction. From the order of<br>brute life one attains to the status of humanity. If born as human being,<br>he is sure to take birth as a Pukkasa or a Chandala. Verily, one having<br>taken birth in that sinful order of existence, viz., Pukkasa, one, O<br>Matanga, has to wander in it for a very long time. Passing a period of<br>one thousand years in that order, one attains next to the status of a<br>Sudra. In the Sudra order, again, one has to wander for a long time.<br>After thirty thousand years one acquire the status of a Vaisya. There, in<br>that order, one has to pass a very long period. After a time that is<br>sixty times longer than what has been stated as the period of Sudra<br>existence, one becomes a person of the fighting order. In the Kshatriya<br>order one has to pass a very long time. After a time that is measured by<br>multiplying the period last referred to by sixty, one becomes born as a<br>fallen Brahmana. In this order one has to wander for a long period. After<br>a time measured by multiplying the period last named by two hundred, one<br>becomes born in the race of such a Brahmana as lives by the profession of<br>arms. There, in that order, one has to wander for a long period. After a<br>time measured by multiplying the period last named by three hundred, one<br>takes birth in the race of a Brahmana that is given to the recitation of<br>the Gayatri and other sacred Mantras. There, in that order, one has to<br>wander for a long period. After a time measured by multiplying the period<br>last named by four hundred, one takes birth in the race of such a<br>Brahmana as is conversant with the entire Vedas and the scriptures,<br>There, in that order, one has to wander for a very long period. While<br>wandering in that status of existence, joy and grief, desire and<br>aversion, vanity and evil speech, seek to enter into him and make a<br>wretch of him. If he succeeds in subjugating those foes, he then attains<br>a high end. If, on the other hand, those enemies succeed in subjugating<br>him, he falls down from that high status like a person falling down on<br>the ground from the high top of a palmyra tree. Knowing this for certain,<br>O Matanga, I say unto thee, do thou name some other boon, for the status<br>of a Brahmana is incapable of being attained by thee (that hast been born<br>as a Chandala)!'
