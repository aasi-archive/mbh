                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast told me in full of those from whom food<br>may be accepted and of those from whom it should not be taken. But I have<br>grave doubts on one point. Do thou, O sire, enlighten me, do thou tell me<br>what expiation a Brahmana should make (for the sin he incurs) upon<br>accepting the different kinds of food, those especially offered in honour<br>of the gods and the oblations made to the manes.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall tell thee, O prince, how high-souled Brahmanas<br>may be absolved from all sin incurred by accepting food from others. In<br>accepting clarified butter, the expiation is made by pouring oblations on<br>the fire, reciting the Savitri hymn. In accepting sesamum, O<br>Yudhishthira, the same expiation has to be made. In accepting meat, or<br>honey, or salt, a Brahmana becomes purified by standing till the rising<br>of the sun. If a Brahmana accepts gold from any one, he becomes cleansed<br>of all sins by silently reciting the great Vedic prayer (Gayatri) and by<br>holding a piece of iron in his hand in the presence of the public. In<br>accepting money or clothes or women or gold, the purification is the same<br>as before. In accepting food, or rice boiled in milk and sugar, or<br>sugarcane juice, or sugar-cane, or oil, or any sacred thing, one becomes<br>purified by bathing thrice in the course of the day, viz., at morn, noon<br>and eve. If one accepts, paddy, flowers, fruits, water, half-ripe barley,<br>milk, or curdled milk, or anything made of meal or flour, the expiation<br>is made by reciting the Gayatri prayer a hundred times. In accepting<br>shoes or clothes at obsequial ceremonies, the sin is destroyed by<br>reciting devoutly the same hymn a hundred times. The acceptance of the<br>gift of land at the time of an eclipse or during the period of impurity,<br>is expiated by observing a fast during three successive nights. The<br>Brahmana who partakes of oblations offered to deceased ancestors, in<br>course of the dark fortnight, is purified by fasting for a whole day and<br>night. Without performing his ablutions a Brahmana should not say his<br>evening prayers, nor betake himself to religious meditation, nor take his<br>food a second time. By so doing he is purified. For this reason, the<br>Sraddha of deceased ancestors has been ordained to be performed in the<br>afternoon and then the Brahmana who has been invited beforehand should be<br>feasted, The Brahmana who partakes of food at the house of a dead person<br>on the third day after the death, is purified by bathing three times<br>daily for twelve days. After the expiration of twelve days, and going<br>through the purification ceremonies duly, the sin is destroyed by giving<br>clarified butter to Brahmanas. If a man takes any food in the house of a<br>dead person, within ten days after the death, he should go through all<br>the expiations before mentioned, and should recite the Savitri hymn and<br>do the sin-destroying Ishti and Kushmanda penances. The Brahmana who<br>takes his food in the house of a dead person for three nights, becomes<br>purified by performing his ablutions thrice daily for seven days, and<br>thus attains all the objects of his desire, and is never troubled by<br>misfortunes. The Brahmana who takes his food in the company of Sudras is<br>purged from all impurity by duly observing the ceremonies of<br>purification. The Brahmana who takes his food in the company of Vaisyas<br>is absolved from sin by living on alms for three successive nights. If a<br>Brahmana takes his food with Kshatriyas, he should make expiation by<br>bathing with his clothes on. By eating with a Sudra from off the same<br>plate the Sudra loses his family respectability; the Vaisya by eating<br>from off the same plate with a Vaisya, loses his cattle and friends. The<br>Kshatriya loses his prosperity, and the Brahmana his splendour and<br>energy. In such cases, expiations should be made, and propitiatory rites<br>should be observed, and oblations offered to the gods. The Savitri hymn<br>should be recited and the Revati rites and Kushmanda penances should be<br>observed with the view of destroying the sin. If any of the above four<br>classes partake of food partly eaten by a person of any other class, the<br>expiation is undoubtedly made by smearing the body with auspicious<br>substances like Rochana, Durva grass, and turmeric.'"
