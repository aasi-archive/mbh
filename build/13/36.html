                            "Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old history of the<br>discourse between Sakra and Samvara. Do thou listen to it, O<br>Yudhishthira. Once upon a time Sakra, assuming the guise of an ascetic<br>with matted locks on his head and body smeared with ashes all over, rode<br>on an ugly car and repaired to the presence of the Asura Samvara.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'Through what conduct, O Samvara, hast thou been able to get<br>at the head of all individuals of thy race? For what reason do all people<br>regard thee as superior? Do thou tell me this truly and in detail.'<br><br>"Samvara said, 'I never cherish any ill-feelings towards the Brahmanas.<br>Whatever instructions they impart I accept with unquestioning reverence.<br>When the Brahmanas are engaged in interpreting the scriptures, I listen<br>to them with great happiness. Having heard their interpretations I never<br>disregard them. Nor do I ever offend against the Brahmanas in any way. I<br>always worship those Brahmanas that are endued with intelligence. I<br>always seek information from them. I always worship their feet.<br>Approaching me with confidence, they always address me with affection and<br>enquire after my welfare. If they ever happen to be heedless, I am always<br>heedful. If they happen to sleep, I always remain wakeful. Like bees<br>drenching the cells of the comb with honey, the Brahmanas, who are my<br>instructors and rulers, always drench me with the nectar of knowledge&#8212;me<br>that am always devoted to the path pointed out by the scriptures, that am<br>devoted to the Brahmanas, and that am perfectly free from malice or evil<br>passion. Whatever they say with cheerful hearts, I always accept aided by<br>memory and understanding. I am always careful of my own faith in them and<br>I always think of my own inferiority to them. I always lick the nectar<br>that dwells at the end of their tongue, and it is for this reason that I<br>occupy a position far above that of all others of my race like the Moon<br>transcending all the stars. The scriptural interpretations which fall<br>from the lips of the Brahmanas and listening to which every wise man acts<br>in the world, constitute nectar on earth and may also be likened to eyes<br>of remarkable excellence.[265] Witnessing the encounter between the<br>deities and the Asuras in days of old, and understanding the puissance of<br>the instructions that fell from the Brahmanas, my father became filled<br>with delight and wonder.[266] Beholding the puissance of high-souled<br>Brahmanas, my sire asked Chandramas the question, 'How do the Brahmanas<br>attain to success?<br><br>'Soma said, 'The Brahmanas become crowned with success through their<br>penances. Their strength consists in speech. The prowess of persons<br>belonging to the kingly order resides in their arms. The Brahmanas,<br>however, have speech for their weapons. Undergoing the discomforts of a<br>residence in the abode of his preceptor, the Brahmana should study the<br>Vedas or at least the Pranava. Divesting himself of wrath and renouncing<br>earthly attachments, he should become a Yati, viewing all things and all<br>creatures with equal eyes. If remaining in the abode of his sire he<br>masters all the Vedas and acquiring great knowledge attains to a position<br>that should command respect people still condemn him as untravelled or<br>homekeeping. Like a snake swallowing mice, the earth swallows up these<br>two, viz., a king that is unwilling to fight and a Brahmana that is<br>unwilling to leave home for acquiring knowledge.[267] Pride destroys the<br>prosperity of persons of little intelligence. A maiden, if she conceives,<br>becomes stained. A Brahmana incurs reproach by keeping at home. Even this<br>is what my father heard from Soma of wonderful aspect. My father, in<br>consequence of this, began to worship and reverence the Brahmanas. Like<br>him, I also worship and adore all Brahmanas of high vows.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, "Hearing these words that fell from the mouth of that<br>prince of Danavas, Sakra began to worship the Brahmanas, and as a<br>consequence thereof he succeeded in obtaining the chiefdom of the<br>deities.'"
