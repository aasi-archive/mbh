                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O best of the Bharatas, I wish to hear thee<br>discourse on the disposition of women. W omen are said to be the root of<br>all evil. They are all regarded as exceedingly frail.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old history of the<br>discourse between the celestial Rishi Narada and the (celestial)<br>courtezan Panchachuda. Once in ancient times, the celestial Rishi Narada,<br>having roamed over all the world, met the Apsara Panchachuda of faultless<br>beauty, having her abode in the region of Brahman. Beholding the Apsara<br>every limb of whose body was endued with great beauty, the ascetic<br>addressed her, saying, 'O thou of slender waist, I have a doubt in my<br>mind. Do thou explain it.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by the Rishi, the Apsara said unto<br>him, 'If the subject is one which is known to me and if thou thinkest me<br>competent to speak on it, I shall certainly say what is in my mind.'<br><br>"Narada said, 'O amiable one, I shall not certainly appoint thee to any<br>task that is beyond thy competence. O thou of beautiful face, I wish to<br>hear from thee of the disposition of women.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Hearing these words of the celestial Rishi, that<br>foremost of Apsaras replied unto him, saying, 'I am unable, being myself<br>a woman, to speak ill of women. Thou knowest what women are and with what<br>nature they are endued. It behoveth thee not, O celestial Rishi, to set<br>me to such a task.' Unto her the celestial Rishi said, 'It is very true,<br>O thou of slender waist! One incurs fault by speaking what is untrue. In<br>saying, however, what is true, there can be no fault.' Thus addressed by<br>him, the Apsara Panchachuda of sweet smiles consented to answer Narada's<br>question. She then addressed herself to mention what the true and eternal<br>faults of women are!'<br><br>"Panchachuda said, 'Even if high-born and endued with beauty and<br>possessed of protectors, women wish to transgress the restraints assigned<br>to them. This fault truly stains them, O Narada! There is nothing else<br>that is more sinful than women. Verily, women, are the root of all<br>faults. That is, certainly known to thee, O Narada! Women, even when<br>possessed of husbands having fame and wealth, of handsome features and<br>completely obedient to them, are prepared to disregard them if they get<br>the opportunity. This, O puissant one, is a sinful disposition with us<br>women that, casting off modesty, we cultivate the companionship of men of<br>sinful habits and intentions. Women betray a liking for those men who<br>court them, who approach their presence, and who respectfully serve them<br>to even a slight extent. Through want of solicitation by persons of the<br>other sex, or fear of relatives, women, who are naturally impatient of<br>all restraints, do not transgress those that have been ordained for them,<br>and remain by the side of their husbands. There is none whom they are<br>incapable of admitting to their favours. They never take into<br>consideration the age of the person they are prepared to favour. Ugly or<br>handsome, if only the person happens to belong to the opposite sex, women<br>are ready to enjoy his companionship. That women remain faithful to their<br>lords is due not to their fear of sin, nor to compassion, nor to wealth,<br>nor to the affection that springs up in their hearts for kinsmen and<br>children. Women living in the bosom of respectable families envy the<br>condition of those members of their sex that are young and well-adorned<br>with jewels and gems and that lead a free life. Even those women that are<br>loved by their husbands and treated with great respect, are seen to<br>bestow their favours upon men that are hump-backed, that are blind, that<br>are idiots, or that are dwarfs. Women may be seen to like the<br>companionship of even those men that are destitute of the power of<br>locomotion or those men that are endued with great ugliness of features.<br>O great Rishi, there is no man in this world whom women may regard as<br>unfit for companionship. Through inability to obtain persons of the<br>opposite sex, or fear of relatives, or fear of death and imprisonment,<br>women remain, of themselves, within the restraints prescribed for them.<br>They are exceedingly restless, for they always hanker after new<br>companions. In consequence of their nature being unintelligible, they are<br>incapable of being kept in obedience by affectionate treatment. Their<br>disposition is such that they are incapable of being restrained when bent<br>upon transgression. Verily, women are like the words uttered by the<br>wise.[271] Fire is never satiated with fuel. Ocean can never be filled<br>with the waters that rivers bring unto him. The Destroyer is never<br>satiated with slaying even all living creatures. Similarly, women are<br>never satiated with men. This, O celestial Rishi. is another mystery<br>connected with women. As soon as they see a man of handsome and charming<br>features, unfailing signs of desire appear on their persons. They never<br>show sufficient regard for even such husbands as accomplish all their<br>wishes, as always do what is agreeable to them and as protect them from<br>want and danger. Women never regard so highly even articles of enjoyment<br>in abundance or ornaments or other possessions of an agreeable kind as<br>they do the companionship of persons of the opposite sex. The destroyer,<br>the deity of wind, death, the nether legions, the equine mouth that roves<br>through the ocean, vomiting ceaseless flames of fire, the sharpness of<br>the razor, virulent poison, the snake, and Fire&#8212;all these exist in a<br>state of union in women. That eternal Brahman whence the five great<br>elements have sprung into existence, whence the Creator Brahma hath<br>ordained the universe, and whence, indeed, men have sprung, verily from<br>the same eternal source have women sprung into existence. At that time,<br>again, O Narada, when women were created, these faults that I have<br>enumerated were planted in them!'"
