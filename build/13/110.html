How, indeed, does one<br>become possessed of religious merit and wealth and pleasure? How does one<br>become endued with happiness?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In the month of Margasirsha, when the moon comes in<br>conjunction with the asterism called Mula, when his two feet are united<br>with that very asterism, O king, when Rohini is in his calf, when his<br>knee-joints are in Aswini, and his shins are in the two Ashadhas, when<br>Phalguni makes his anus, and Krittika his waist, when his navel is in<br>Bhadrapada, his ocular region in. Revati, and his back on the<br>Dhanishthas, when Anuradha makes his belly, when with his two arms he<br>reaches the Visakhas, when his two hands are indicated by Hasta, when<br>Punarvasu, O king, makes his fingers, Aslesha his nails, when Jyeshtha is<br>known for his neck, when by Sravana is pointed out his ears, and his<br>mouth by Pushya, when Swati is said to constitute his teeth and lips,<br>when Satabhisha is his smile and Magha his nose, when Mrigasiras is known<br>to be in his eye, and Chitra in his forehead, when his head is in<br>Bharani, when Ardra constitutes his hair, O king, the vow called<br>Chandravrata should be commenced. Upon the completion of that vow, gift<br>of ghee should be made unto Brahmanas conversant with the Vedas. As the<br>fruit of that vow, one becomes possessed about knowledge. Indeed, one<br>becomes, in consequence of such a vow, as full (of every blessed<br>attribute) as the moon himself when he is at full.'"
