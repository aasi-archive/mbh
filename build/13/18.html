                            "Vaisampayana said, 'After Vasudeva had ceased to speak, the great Yogin,<br>viz. the Island-born Krishna, addressed Yudhisthira, saying,&#8212;O son, do<br>thou recite this hymn consisting of the thousand and eight names of<br>Mahadeva, and let Maheswara be gratified with thee. In former days, O<br>son, I was engaged in the practice of severe austerities on the breast of<br>the mountains of Meru from desire of obtaining a son. It is this very<br>hymn that was recited by me. As the reward of this, I obtained the<br>fruition of all my wishes, O son of Pandu. Thou wilt also, by reciting<br>this same hymn, obtain from Sarva the fruition of all thy wishes.&#8212;After<br>this, Kapila, the Rishi who promulgated the doctrines that go by the name<br>of Sankhya, and who is honoured by the gods themselves, said,&#8212;I adore<br>Bhava with great devotion for many lives together. The illustrious Deity<br>at last became gratified with me and gave me knowledge that is capable of<br>aiding the acquirer in getting over rebirth.&#8212;After this, the Rishi named<br>Charusirsha, that dear friend of Sakra and known otherwise under the name<br>of Alamvana's son and who is filled with compassion, said,&#8212;I, in former<br>days, repaired to the mountains of Gokarna and sat myself to practise<br>severe penances for a hundred years. As the reward of those penances, I<br>obtained from Sarva, O son of king Pandu, a hundred sons, all of whom<br>were born without the intervention of woman, of well-restrained soul,<br>conversant with righteousness, possessed of great splendour, free from<br>disease and sorrow, and endued with lives extending over a hundred<br>thousand years&#8212;Then the illustrious Valmiki, addressing Yudhishthira,<br>said,&#8212;Once upon a time, in course of a dialectical disputation, certain<br>ascetics that were possessors of the homa fire denounced me as one guilty<br>of Brahmanicide. As soon as they had denounced me as such, the sin of<br>Brahmanicide, O Bharata, possessed me. I then, for cleansing myself,<br>sought the protection of the sinless Isana who is irresistible in energy.<br>I become cleansed of all my sins. That dispeller of all sorrows, viz.,<br>the destroyer of the triple city of the Asuras, said unto me,&#8212;Thy fame<br>shall be great in the world&#8212;Then Jamadagni's son, that foremost of all<br>righteous persons, shining like the Sun with blazing splendour in the<br>midst of that conclave of Rishis, said unto the son of Kunti these<br>words;&#8212;I was afflicted with the sin, O eldest son of Pandu, of<br>Brahmanicide for having slain my brothers who were all learned Brahmanas.<br>For purifying myself, I sought the protection, O king, of Mahadeva. I<br>hymned the praises of the great Deity by reciting his names. At this,<br>Bhava became gratified with me and gave me a battle-axe and many other<br>celestial weapons. And he said unto me,&#8212;Thou shalt be freed from sin and<br>thou shalt be invincible in battle; Death himself shall not succeed in<br>overcoming thee for thou shalt be freed from disease.&#8212;Even thus did the<br>illustrious and crested Deity of auspicious form said unto me. Through<br>the grace of that Deity of supreme intelligence I obtained all that He<br>had said. Then Viswamitra said,&#8212;I was formerly a Kshatriya. I paid my<br>adorations to Bhava with the desire of becoming a Brahmana Through the<br>grace of that great Deity I succeeded in obtaining the high status of a<br>Brahmana that is so difficult to obtain.&#8212;Then the Rishi Asita-Devala,<br>addressing the royal son of Pandu, said,&#8212;In former days, O son of Kunti,<br>through the curse of Sakra, all my merit due to the acts of righteousness<br>I had performed, was destroyed. The puissant Mahadeva it was who kindly<br>gave me back that merit together with great fame and a long life.&#8212;The<br>illustrious Rishi Gritsamada, the dear friend of Sakra, who resembled the<br>celestial preceptor Vrihaspati himself in splendour, addressing<br>Yudhishthira of Ajamidha's race said,&#8212;The inconceivable Sakra had, in<br>days of yore, performed a sacrifice extending over a thousand years.<br>While that sacrifice was going on, I was engaged by Sakra in reciting the<br>Samans. Varishtha, the son of that Manu who sprung from the eyes of<br>Brahma, came to that sacrifice and addressing me, said.&#8212;O foremost of<br>regenerate persons, the Rathantara is not being recited properly by thee.<br>O best of Brahmanas, cease to earn demerit by reading so faultily, and<br>with the aid of thy understanding do thou read the Samans correctly. O<br>thou of wicked understanding, why dost thou perpetrate such sin that is<br>destructive of sacrifice.&#8212;Having said these words, the Rishi Varishtha,<br>who was very wrathful, gave way to that passion and addressing me once<br>more, said,&#8212;Be thou an animal divested of intelligence, subject to<br>grief, ever filled with fear, and a denizen of trackless forests<br>destitute of both wind and water and abandoned by other animals. Do thou<br>thus pass ten thousand years with ten and eight hundred years in<br>addition. That forest in which thou shalt have to pass this period will<br>be destitute of all holy trees and will, besides, be the haunt of Rurus<br>and lions. Verily, thou shalt have to become a cruel deer plunged in<br>excess of grief.&#8212;As soon as he had said these words, O son of Pritha, I<br>immediately became transformed into a deer. I then sought the protection<br>of Maheswara. The great Deity said unto me,&#8212;Thou shalt be freed from<br>disease of every kind, and besides immortality shall be thine. Grief<br>shall never afflict thee. Thy friendship with Indra shall remain<br>unchanged, and let the sacrifices of both Indra and thyself Increase. The<br>illustrious and puissant Mahadeva favours all creatures in this way. He<br>is always the great dispenser and ordainer in the matter of the happiness<br>and sorrow of all living creatures. That illustrious Deity is incapable<br>of being comprehended in thought, word, or deed. O son, O thou that are<br>the best of warriors (through the grace of Mahadeva), there is none that<br>is equal to me in learning.&#8212;After this, Vasudeva, that foremost of all<br>intelligent men, once more said,&#8212;Mahadeva of golden eyes was gratified<br>by me with my penances. Gratified with me, O Yudhishthira, the<br>illustrious Deity said unto me,&#8212;Thou shalt, O Krishna, through my grace,<br>become dearer to all persons than wealth which is coveted by all. Thou<br>shalt be invincible in battle. Thy energy shall be equal to that of Fire.<br>Thousands of other boons Mahadeva gave unto me on that occasion. In a<br>former incarnation I adored Mahadeva on the Manimantha mountain for<br>millions of years. Gratified with me, the illustrious Deity said unto me<br>these words:&#8212;Blessed be thou, do thou solicit boons as thou wishest.<br>Bowing unto him with a bend of my head, I said these words,&#8212;If the<br>puissant Mahadeva has been gratified with me, then let my devotion to him<br>be unchanged, O Isana! Even this is the boon that I solicit.&#8212;The great<br>God said unto me,&#8212;Be it so&#8212;and disappeared there and then.'<br><br>"Jaigishavya said, 'O Yudhishthira, formerly in the city of Varanasi, the<br>puissant Mahadeva searching me out, conferred upon me the eight<br>attributes of sovereignty.'"<br><br>"Garga said,&#8212;'O son of Pandu, gratified with me in consequence of mental<br>sacrifice which I had performed, the great God bestowed upon me, on the<br>banks of the sacred stream Saraswati, that wonderful science, viz., the<br>knowledge of Time with its four and sixty branches. He also, bestowed<br>upon me, a thousand sons, all possessed of equal merit and fully<br>conversant with the Vedas. Through his grace, their periods of life as<br>also that of mine have become extended to ten millions of years.'"<br><br>"Parasara said,&#8212;'In former times I gratified Sarva, O king. I then<br>cherished the desire of obtaining a son that would be possessed of great<br>ascetic merit, endued with superior energy, and addressed to high Yoga,<br>that would earn world-wide fame, arrange the Vedas, and become the home<br>of prosperity, that would be devoted to the Vedas and the Brahmanas and<br>be distinguished for compassion. Even such a son was desired by me from<br>Maheswara. Knowing that this was the wish of my heart, that foremost of<br>Deities said unto me.&#8212;Through the fruition of that object of thine which<br>thou wishest to obtain from me, thou shalt have a son of the name of<br>Krishna. In that creation which shall be known after the name of<br>Savarni-Manu, that son of thine shall be reckoned among the seven Rishis.<br>He shall arrange the Vedas, and be the propagator of Kuru's race. He<br>shall, besides, be the author of the ancient histories and do good to the<br>universe. Endued with severe penances, he shall, again, be the dear<br>friend of Sakra. Freed from diseases of every kind, that son of thine, O<br>Parasara, shall besides, be immortal.&#8212;Having said these words, the great<br>Deity disappeared there and then. Even such is the good, O Yudhishthira,<br>that I have obtained from that indestructible and immutable God, endued<br>with the highest penances and supreme energy.'<br><br>"Mandavya said,&#8212;'In former times though not a thief and yet wrongly<br>suspected of theft, I was impaled (under the orders of a king). I then<br>adored the illustrious Mahadeva who said unto me,&#8212;Thou shalt soon be<br>freed from impalement and live for millions of years. The pangs due to<br>impalement shall not be thine. Thou shalt also be freed from every kind<br>of affliction and disease. And since, O ascetic, this body of thine hath<br>sprung from the fourth foot of Dharma (viz., Truth). Thou shalt be<br>unrivalled on Earth. Do thou make thy life fruitful. Thou shalt, without<br>any obstruction, be able to bathe in all the sacred waters of the Earth.<br>And after the dissolution of thy body, I shall, O learned Brahmana,<br>ordain that thou shall enjoy the pure felicity of heaven for unending<br>Time.&#8212;Having said these words unto me, the adorable Deity having the<br>bull for his vehicle, viz., Maheswara of unrivalled splendour and clad in<br>animal skin, O king, disappeared there and then with all his associates.'<br><br>"Galava said, Formerly I studied at the feet of my preceptor Viswamitra.<br>Obtaining his permission I set out for home with the object of seeing my<br>father. My mother (having become a widow), was filled with sorrow and<br>weeping bitterly, said unto me,&#8212;Alas, thy father will never see his son<br>who, adorned with Vedic knowledge, has been permitted by his preceptor to<br>come home and who, possessed of all the graces of youth, is endued with<br>self-restraint.&#8212;Hearing these words of my mother, I became filled with<br>despair in respect of again beholding my sire. I then paid my adoration<br>with a rapt soul to Maheswara who, gratified with me, showed himself to<br>me and said,&#8212;Thy sire, thy mother, and thyself, O son, shall all be<br>freed from death. Go quickly and enter thy abode; thou shall behold thy<br>sire there.&#8212;Having obtained the permission of the illustrious Deity, I<br>then repaired to my home, O Yudhishthira, and beheld my father, O son,<br>coming out after having finished his daily sacrifice. And he came out,<br>bearing in his hands a quantity of Homa-fuel and Kusa grass and some<br>fallen fruits. And he seemed to have already taken his daily food, for he<br>had washed himself properly. Throwing down those things from his hand, my<br>father, with eyes bathed in tears (of joy), raised me, for I had<br>prostrated myself at his feet. Embracing me he smelt my head, O son of<br>Pandu, and said.&#8212;By good luck, O son, art thou seen by me. Thou hast<br>come back, having acquired knowledge from the preceptor.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these marvellous and most wonderful<br>feats of the illustrious Mahadeva recited by the ascetics, the son of<br>Pandu became amazed. Then Krishna, that foremost of all intelligent<br>persons, spoke once more unto Yudhishthira, that ocean of righteousness,<br>like Vishnu speaking unto Puruhuta.'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'Upamanyu, who seemed to blaze with effulgence like the<br>Sun, said unto me,&#8212;Those sinful men that are stained with unrighteous<br>deeds, do not succeed in attaining to Isana. Their dispositions being<br>stained by the attributes of Rajas and Tamas, they can never approach the<br>Supreme Deity. It is only those regenerate persons who are of cleansed<br>souls that succeed in attaining to the Supreme Deity. Even if a person<br>lives in the enjoyment of every pleasure and luxury, yet if he be devoted<br>to the Supreme Deity, he comes to be regarded as the equal of forest<br>recluses of cleansed souls. If Rudra be gratified with a person, he can<br>confer upon him the states of ether Brahma or of Kesava or of Sakra with<br>all the deities under him, or the sovereignty of the three worlds. Those<br>men, O sire, who worship Bhava even mentally, succeed in freeing<br>themselves from all sins and attain to a residence in heaven with all the<br>gods. A person who raises houses to the ground and destroys tanks and<br>lakes indeed, who devastates the whole universe, does not become stained<br>with sin, if he adores and worships the illustrious Deity of three eyes.<br>A person that is destitute of every auspicious indication and that is<br>stained by every sin, has all his sins destroyed by meditating upon Siva.<br>Even worm and insects and birds, O Kesava, that devote themselves to<br>Mahadeva, are enabled to rove in perfect fearlessness. Even this is my<br>settled conviction that those men who devote themselves to Mahadeva<br>become certainly emancipated from rebirth. After this, Krishna again<br>addressed Yudhishthira the son of Dharma in the following words.<br><br>"Vishnu said, O Great King, 'Aditya, Chandra, Wind, Fire, Heaven, Earth,<br>the Vasus, the Viswedevas, Dhatri, Aryyaman, Sukra, Vrihaspati, the<br>Rudras, the Saddhyas, Varuna, Brahma, Sakra, Maruts, the Upanishads that<br>deal with knowledge of Brahman, Truth, the Vedas, the Sacrifices,<br>Sacrificial Presents, Brahmanas reciting the Vedas, Soma, Sacrificer, the<br>shares of the deities in sacrificial offerings or clarified butter poured<br>in sacrifices, Raksha, Diksha, all kinds of restraints in the form of<br>vows and fasts and rigid observances, Swaha, Vashat, the Brahmanas, the<br>celestial cow, the foremost acts of righteousness, the wheel of Time,<br>Strength, Fame, Self-restraint, the Steadiness of all persons endued with<br>intelligence, all acts of goodness and the reverse, the seven Rishis,<br>Understanding of the foremost order, all kinds of excellent touch, the<br>success of all (religious) acts, the diverse tribes of the deities, those<br>beings that drink heat, those that are drinkers of Soma, Clouds, Suyamas,<br>Rishitas, all creatures having Mantras for their bodies, Abhasuras, those<br>beings that live upon scents only, those that live upon vision only,<br>those that restrain their speech, those that restrain their minds, those<br>that are pure, those that are capable of assuming diverse forms through<br>Yoga-puissance, those deities that live on touch (as their food), those<br>deities that subsist on vision and those that subsist upon the butter<br>poured in sacrifices, those beings that are competent to create by fiats<br>of their will the objects they require, they that are regarded as the<br>foremost ones among the deities, and all the other deities, O descendant<br>of Ajamila, the Suparnas, the Gandharvas, the Pisachas, the Danavas,<br>Yakshas, the Charanas, the snakes, all that is gross and all that is<br>exceedingly subtile, all that is soft and all that is not subtile, all<br>sorrows and all joys, all sorrows that come after joy and all joy that<br>comes after sorrow, the Sankhya philosophy, Yoga, and that which<br>transcends objects which are regarded as foremost and very superior,&#8212;all<br>adorable things, all the deities, and all the protectors of the universe<br>who entering into the physical forces sustain and uphold this ancient<br>creation of that illustrious Deity,&#8212;have sprung from that Creator of all<br>creatures. All this that I have mentioned is grosser than that which the<br>wise think of with the aid of Penances. Indeed, that subtile Brahma is<br>the cause of life. I bow my head in reverence to it. Let that immutable<br>and indestructible Master, always adored by us, grant us desirable boons.<br>That person who, subjugating his senses and purifying himself, recites<br>this hymn, without interruption in respect of his vow, for one month,<br>succeeds in obtaining the merit that is attached to a Horse-sacrifice. By<br>reciting this hymn the Brahmana succeeds in acquiring all the Vedas; the<br>Kshatriya becomes crowned with victory, O son of Pritha; the Vaisya<br>becomes successful in obtaining wealth and cleverness; and the Sudra, in<br>winning happiness here and a good end hereafter. Persons of great fame,<br>by reciting this prince of hymns that is competent to cleanse every sin<br>and that is highly sacred and purifying, set their hearts on Rudra. A man<br>by reciting this prince of hymns succeeds in living in heaven for as many<br>years as there are pores in his body.'"
