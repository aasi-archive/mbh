                            "Yudhishthira said, 'The disposition is seen, O grandsire, in all the<br>orders of men, including the very Mlechchhas, of observing fasts. The<br>reason, however, of this is not known to us. It has been heard by us that<br>only Brahmanas and Kshatriyas should observe the vow of fasts. How, O<br>grandsire, are the other orders to be taken as earning any merit by the<br>observance of fasts? How have vows and fasts come to be observed by<br>persons of all orders, O king? What is that end to which one devoted to<br>the observance of fasts attains? It has been said that fasts are highly<br>meritorious and that fasts are a great refuge. O prince of men, what is<br>the fruit that is earned in this world by the man that observe fasts? By<br>what means is one cleansed of one's sins? By what means doth one acquire<br>righteousness? By what means, O best of the Bharatas, doth one succeed in<br>acquiring heaven and merit? After having observed a fast, what should one<br>give away, O king? O, tell me, what those duties are by which one may<br>succeed in obtaining such objects as lead to happiness?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Unto Kunti's son by the deity of Dharma, who<br>was conversant with every duty and who said so unto him, Santanu's son,<br>Bhishma, who was acquainted with every duty, answered in the following<br>words.'<br><br>"Bhishma, said, 'In former days, O king, I heard of these high merits, O<br>chief of Bharata's race, as attaching to the observance of fasts<br>according to the ordinance, I had, O Bharata, asked the Rishi Angiras of<br>high ascetic merit, the very same questions which thou hast asked me<br>today. Questioned by me thus, the illustrious Rishi, who sprang from the<br>sacrificial fire, answered me even thus in respect of the observance of<br>fasts according to the ordinance.'<br><br>"Angiras said, 'As regards Brahmanas and Kshatriyas, fasts for three<br>nights at a stretch are ordained for them, O delighter of the Kurus.<br>Indeed, O chief of men, a fast for one night, for two nights, and for<br>three nights, may be observed by them. (They should never go beyond three<br>nights). As regards Vaisyas and Sudras, the duration of fasts prescribed<br>for them is a single night. If, from folly, they observe fasts for two or<br>three nights, such fasts never lead to their advancement. Indeed, for<br>Vaisyas and Sudras, fasts for two nights have been ordained (on certain<br>special occasions). Fasts for three nights, however, have not been laid<br>down for them by persons conversant with and observant of duties. That<br>man of wisdom who, with his senses and soul under control, O Bharata,<br>fasts, by abstaining from one of the two meals, on the fifth and the<br>sixth days of the moon as also on the day of the full moon, becomes<br>endured with forgiveness and beauty of person and conversance with the<br>scriptures. Such a person never becomes childless and poor. He who<br>performs sacrifices for adoring the deities on the fifth and sixth days<br>of the moon, transcends all the members of his family and succeeds in<br>feeding a large number of Brahmanas. He who observes fasts on the eighth<br>and the fourteenth days of the dark fortnight, becomes freed from<br>maladies of every kind and possessed of great energy. The man who<br>abstains from one meal every day throughout the month called Margasirsha,<br>should, with reverence and devotion, feed a number of Brahmanas. By so<br>doing he becomes freed from all his sins. Such a man becomes endued with<br>prosperity, and all kinds of grain become his. He becomes endued with<br>energy. In fact, such a person reaps an abundance of harvest from his<br>fields, acquires great wealth and much corn. That man, O son of Kunti,<br>who passes the whole month of Pausha, abstaining every day from one of<br>two meals, becomes endued with good fortune and agreeable features and<br>great fame. He who passes the whole month of Magha, abstaining every day<br>from one of the two meals, takes birth in a high family and attains to a<br>position of eminence among his kinsmen. He who passes the whole month of<br>Bhagadaivata, confining himself every day to only one meal becomes a<br>favourite with women who, indeed, readily own his sway. He who passes the<br>whole of the month of Chaitra, confining himself every day to one meal,<br>takes birth in a high family and becomes rich in gold, gems, and pearls.<br>The person, whether male or female, who passes the month of Vaisakha,<br>confining himself or herself every day to one meal, and keeping his or<br>her senses under control, succeeds in attaining to a position of eminence<br>among kinsmen. The person who passes the month of Jyaishtha confining<br>himself every day to one meal a day, succeeds in attaining to a position<br>of eminence and great wealth. If a woman, she reaps the same reward. He<br>who passes the month of Ashadha confining himself to one meal a day and<br>with senses steadily concentrated upon his duties, becomes possessed of<br>much corn, great wealth, and a large progeny. He who passes the month of<br>Sravana, confining himself to one meal a day, receives the honours of<br>Abhisheka wherever he may happen to reside, and attains to a position of<br>eminence among kinsmen whom he supports. That man who confines himself to<br>only one meal a day for the whole month of Proshthapada, becomes endued<br>with great wealth and attains, to swelling and durable affluence. The man<br>who passes the month of Aswin, confining himself to one meal a day,<br>becomes pure in soul and body, possessed of animals and vehicles in<br>abundance, and a large progeny. He who passes the month of Kartika,<br>confining himself to one meal every day, becomes possessed of heroism,<br>many spouses, and great fame. I have now told thee, O chief of men what<br>the fruits are that are obtained by men by observing fasts for the two<br>and ten months in detail. Listen now, O king, to me as I tell thee what<br>the rules are in respect of each of the lunar days. The man who,<br>abstaining from it every day, takes rice at the expiration of every<br>fortnight, becomes possessed of a great many kine, a large progeny, and a<br>long life. He who observes a fast for three nights every month and<br>conducts himself thus for two and ten years, attains to a position of<br>supremacy among his kinsmen and associates, without a rival to contest<br>his claim and without any anxiety caused by any one endeavouring to rise<br>to the same height. These rules that I speak of, O chief of Bharata's<br>race, should be observed for two and ten years. Let the inclination be<br>manifested towards it. That man who eats once in the forenoon and once<br>after evening and abstains from drinking (or eating anything) in the<br>interval, and who observes compassion, towards all creatures and pours<br>libations of clarified butter on his sacred fire every day, attains to<br>success, O king, in six years. There is no doubt in this. Such a man<br>earns the merit that attaches to the performance of the Agnishtoma<br>sacrifice. Endued with merit and freed from every kind of stain, he<br>attains to the region of the Apsaras that echo with the sound of songs<br>and dance, and passes his days in the company of a thousand damsels of<br>great beauty. He rides on a car of the complexion of melted gold and<br>receives high honours in the region of Brahma. After the exhaustion of<br>that merit such a person comes back to earth and attains to pre-eminence<br>of position. That man who passes one whole year, confining himself every<br>day to only one meal, attains to the merit of the Atiratra sacrifice. He<br>ascends to heaven after death and receives great honours there. Upon the<br>exhaustion of that merit he returns to earth and attains to a position of<br>eminence. He who passes one whole year observing fasts for three days in<br>succession and taking food on every fourth day, and abstaining from<br>injury from every kind adheres to truthfulness of speech and keeps his<br>senses under control, attains to the merit of the Vajapeya sacrifice.<br>Such a person ascends to heaven after death and receives high honours<br>there. That man, O son of Kunti, who passes a whole year observing fasts<br>for five days and taking food on only the sixth day, acquires the merit<br>of the Horse-sacrifice. The chariot he rides is drawn by Chakravakas.<br>Such a man enjoys every kind of happiness in heaven for full forty<br>thousand years. He who passes a whole year observing fasts for seven days<br>and taking food on only every eighth day, acquires the merit of the<br>Gavamaya sacrifice. The chariot he rides is drawn by swans and cranes.<br>Such a person enjoys all kinds of happiness in Heaven for fifty thousand<br>years. He who passes a whole year, O king, eating only at intervals of a<br>fortnight, acquires the merit of a continuous fast for six months. This<br>has been said by the illustrious Angiras himself. Such a man dwells in<br>heaven for sixty thousand years. He is roused every morning from his bed<br>by the sweet notes of Vinas and Vallakis and flutes, O king. He who<br>passes a whole year, drinking only a little water at the expiration of<br>every month, acquires, O monarch, the merit of the Viswajit sacrifice.<br>Such a man rides a chariot drawn by lions and tigers. He dwells in heaven<br>for seventy thousand years in the enjoyment of every kind of happiness.<br>No fast for more than a month, O chief of men, has been ordained. Even<br>this, O son of Pritha, is the ordinance in respect of fasts that has been<br>declared by sages conversant with duties. That man who, unafflicted by<br>disease and free from every malady, observes a fast, verily acquires, at<br>every step the merits that attach to Sacrifices. Such a man ascends to<br>Heaven on a car drawn by swans. Endued with puissance, he enjoys every<br>kind of happiness in heaven for a hundred years. A hundred Apsaras of the<br>most beautiful features wait upon and sport with him. He is roused from<br>his bed every morning by the sound of the Kanchis and the Nupuras of<br>those damsels.[489] Such a person rides on a car drawn by a thousand<br>swans. Dwelling, again, in a region teeming with hundreds of the most<br>beautiful damsels, he passes his time in great joy. The person who is<br>desirous of heaven does not like the accession of strength when he<br>becomes weak, or the cure of wounds when he is wounded, or the<br>administration of healing drugs when he is ill, or soothing by others<br>when he is angry, or the mitigation, by the expenditure of wealth, of<br>sorrows caused by poverty, Leaving this world where he suffers only<br>privations of every kind, he proceeds to heaven and rides on cars adorned<br>with gold, his person embellished with ornaments of every kind. There, in<br>the midst of hundreds of beautiful damsels, he enjoys all kinds of<br>pleasure and happiness, cleansed of every sin. Indeed, abstaining from<br>food and enjoyments in this world, he takes leave of this body and<br>ascends to heaven as the fruit of his penances. There, freed from all his<br>sins, health and happiness become his and whatever wishes arise in his<br>mind become crowned with fruition. Such a person rides on a celestial car<br>of golden complexion, of the effulgence of the morning sun, set with<br>pearls and lapis lazuli, resounding with the music of Vinas and Murajas,<br>adorned with banners and lamps, and echoing with the tinkle of celestial<br>bells, such a person enjoys all kinds of happiness in heaven for as many<br>years as there are pores in his body. There is no Sastra superior to the<br>Veda. There is no person more worthy of reverence than the mother. There<br>is no acquisition superior to that of Righteousness, and no penance<br>superior to fast. There is nothing, more sacred, in heaven or earth, than<br>Brahmanas. After the same manner there is no penance that is superior to<br>the observance of fasts. It was by fasts that the deities have succeeded<br>in becoming denizens of heaven. It is by fasts that the Rishis have<br>attained to high success. Viswamitra passed a thousand celestial years,<br>confining himself every day to only one meal, and as the consequence<br>thereof attained to the status of a Brahmana. Chyavana and Jamadagni and<br>Vasishtha and Gautama and Bhrigu&#8212;all these great Rishis endued with the<br>virtue of forgiveness, have attained to heaven through observance of<br>fasts. In former days Angiras declared so unto the great Rishis. The man<br>who teaches another the merit of fasts have never to suffer any kind of<br>misery. The ordinances about fasts, in their due order, O son of Kunti,<br>have flowed from the great Rishi Angiras. The man who daily reads these<br>ordinances or hears them read, becomes freed from sins of every kind. Not<br>only is such a person freed from every calamity, but his mind becomes<br>incapable of being touched by any kind of fault. Such a person succeeds<br>in understanding the sounds of all creatures other than human, and<br>acquiring eternal fame, become foremost of his species.'"
