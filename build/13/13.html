                            "Yudhishthira said, 'What should a man do in order to pass pleasantly<br>through this and the other world. How, indeed, should one conduct<br>oneself? What practices should one adopt with this end in view?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'One should avoid the three acts that are done with the<br>body, the four that are done with speech, the three that are done with<br>the mind, and the ten paths of action. The three acts that are done with<br>the body and should be wholly avoided are the destruction of the lives of<br>other creatures, theft or appropriation of what belongs to other persons,<br>and the enjoyment of other people's wives. The four acts that are done<br>with speech, O king, and that should never be indulged in or even thought<br>of, are evil conversation, harsh words, publishing other people's faults,<br>and falsehood. Coveting the possessions of others, doing injury to<br>others, and disbelief in the ordinances of the Vedas, are the three acts<br>done with the mind which should always be avoided.[31] Hence, one should<br>never do any evil act in word, body, or mind. By doing good and evil<br>acts, one is sure to enjoy or endure the just consequences thereof.<br>Nothing can be more certain than this.'"
