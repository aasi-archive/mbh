                            "Bhishma said, 'A person that is born of an irregular union presents<br>diverse features of disposition. One's purity of birth, again, is to be<br>ascertained from one's acts which must resemble the acts of those who are<br>admittedly good and righteous. A disrespectable behaviour, acts opposed<br>to those laid down in the scriptures, crookedness and cruelty, and<br>abstention from sacrifices and other spiritual acts that lead to merit,<br>proclaim one's impurity of origin. A son receives the disposition of<br>either the sire or the mother. Sometimes he catches the dispositions of<br>both. A person of impure birth can never succeed in concealing his true<br>disposition. As the cub of a tiger or a leopard resembles its sire and<br>dam in form and in (the matter of) its stripes of spots, even so a person<br>cannot but betray the circumstance of his origin. However covered may the<br>course of one's descent be, if that descent happens to be impure, its<br>character or disposition is sure to manifest itself slightly or largely.<br>A person may, for purposes of his own, choose to tread on an insincere<br>path, displaying such conduct as seems to be righteous. His own<br>disposition, however, in the matter of those acts that he does, always<br>proclaims whether he belongs to a good order or to a different one.<br>Creatures in the world are endued with diverse kinds of disposition. They<br>are, again, seen to be employed in diverse kinds of acts. Amongst<br>creatures thus employed, there is nothing that is so good or precious as<br>pure birth and righteous conduct. If a person be born in a low order,<br>that good understanding which arises from a study of the scriptures fails<br>to rescue his body from low acts. Absolute goodness of understanding may<br>be of different degrees. It may be high, middling, or low. Even if it<br>appears in a person of low extraction, it disappears like autumnal clouds<br>without producing any consequences. On the other hand, that other<br>goodness of understanding which, according to its measure, has ordained<br>the status in which the person has been born, shows itself in his<br>acts[301]. If a person happens to belong to a superior order but still if<br>he happens to be divested of good behaviour, he should receive no respect<br>or worship. One may worship even a Sudra if he happens to be conversant<br>with duties and be of good conduct. A person proclaims himself by his own<br>good and acts and by his good or bad disposition and birth. If one's race<br>of birth happens to be degraded for any reason, one soon raises it and<br>makes it resplendent and famous by one's acts. For these reasons they<br>that are endued with wisdom should avoid those women, among these diverse<br>castes mixed or pure, upon whom they should not beget offspring.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Do thou discourse to us, O sire, upon the orders and<br>classes separately, upon different kinds of sons begotten upon different<br>types of women, upon the person entitled to have them as sons, and upon<br>their status in life. It is known that disputes frequently arise with<br>respect to sons. It behoveth thee, O king, to solve the doubts that have<br>taken possession of our minds. Indeed, we are stupefied with respect to<br>this subject.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The son of one's loins is regarded as one's own self. The<br>son that is begotten upon one's wife by a person whom one has invited for<br>the task, is called Niruktaja. The son that is begotten upon one's wife<br>by somebody without one's permission, is Prasritaja. The son begotten<br>upon his own wife by a person fallen away from his status is called<br>Patitaja. There are two other sons, viz., the son given, and the son<br>made. There is another called Adhyudha.[302] The son born of a maiden in<br>her father's house is called Kanina. Besides these, there are six kinds<br>of sons called Apadhwansaja and six others that are Apasadas. These are<br>the several kinds of sons mentioned in the scriptures, learn, O Bharata!<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Who are the six that are called Apadhwansajas? Who<br>also are the Apasadas? It behoveth thee to explain all these to me in<br>detail.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The sons that a Brahmana begets upon spouses taken from<br>the three inferior orders, those begotten by a Kshatriya upon spouses<br>taken from the two orders inferior to his own, O Bharata, and the sons<br>that a Vaisya begets upon a spouse taken from the one order that is<br>inferior to his,&#8212;are all called Apadhwansajas. They are, as thus<br>explained, of six kinds. Listen now to me as I tell thee who the<br>Apasadas, are. The son that a Sudra begets upon a Brahmana woman is<br>called a Chandala. Begotten upon a Kshatriya woman by a person of the<br>Sudra order, the son is called a Vratya. He who is born of a Vaisya woman<br>by a Sudra father is called a Vaidya. These three kinds of sons are<br>called Apasadas. The Vaisya, by uniting himself with a woman of the<br>Brahmana order, begets a son that is called a Magadha, while the son that<br>he gets upon a Kshatriya woman is called a Vamaka. The Kshatriya can<br>beget but one kind of son upon a woman of a superior order. Indeed, the<br>son begotten by a Kshatriya upon a Brahmana woman, is called a Suta.<br>These three also are called Apasadas. It cannot be said, O king, that<br>these six kinds of sons are no sons.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Some say that one's son is he that is born in one's<br>soil. Some, on the other hand, say that one's son is he who has been<br>begotten from one's seed. Are both these kinds of sons equal? Whore,<br>again, is the son to be? Do thou tell me this, O grandsire!<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'His is the son from whose seed he has sprung. If,<br>however, the owner of the seed abandons the son born of it, such a son<br>then becomes his upon whose spouse he has been begotten. The same rule<br>applies to the son called Adhyudha. He belongs to the person from whose<br>seed he has taken his birth. If, however, the owner of the seed abandons<br>him, he becomes the son of the husband of his mother.[303] Know that even<br>this is what the law declares.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'We know that the son becomes his from whose seed he<br>has taken birth. Whence does the husband of the woman that brings forth<br>the son derive his right to the latter? Similarly, the son called<br>Adhyudha should be known to be the son of him from whose seed he has<br>sprung. How can they be sons of others by reasons of the engagement about<br>owning and rearing them having been broken?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'He who having begotten a son of his own loins, abandons<br>him for some reason or other, cannot be regarded as the sire of such a<br>son, for vital seed only cannot create sonship. Such a son must be held<br>to belong to the person who owns the soil. When a man, desiring to have a<br>son, weds a girl quick with child, the son born of his spouse must belong<br>to him, for it is the fruit of his own soil. The person from whose vital<br>seed the son has sprung can have no right to such a son. The son that is<br>born in one's soil but not begotten by the owner, O chief of Bharata's<br>race, bears all the marks of the sire that has actually begotten him (and<br>not the marks of one that is only the husband of his mother). The son<br>thus born is incapable of concealing the evidences that physiognomy<br>offers. He is at once known by eyesight (to belong to another).[304] As<br>regards the son made, he is sometimes regarded as the child of the person<br>who has made him a son and so brings him up. In his case, neither the<br>vital seed of which he is born nor the soil in which he is born, becomes<br>the cause of sonship.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'What kind of a son is that who is said to be a made<br>son and whose sonship arises from the fact of his being taken and brought<br>up and in whose case neither the vital seed nor the soil of birth, O<br>Bharata, is regarded as the cause of sonship?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'When a person takes up and rears a son that has been cast<br>off on the road by his father and mother, and when the person thus taking<br>and rearing him fails to find out his parents after search, he becomes<br>the father of such a son and the latter becomes what is called his made<br>son. Not having anybody to own him, he becomes owned by him who brings<br>him up. Such a son, again, comes to be regarded as belonging to that<br>order to which his owner or rearer belongs.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, How should the purificatory rites of such a person be<br>performed? In whose case what sort of rites are to be performed? With<br>what girl should he be wedded? Do thou tell me all this, O grandsire!"<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The rites of purification touching such a son should be<br>performed conformably to the usage of the person himself that raises him,<br>for, cast off by his parents, such a son obtains the order of the person<br>that takes him and brings him up. Indeed, O thou of unfading glory, the<br>rearer should perform all the purificatory rites with respect to such a<br>son according to the practices of the rearer's own race and kinsmen. As<br>regards the girl also, O Yudhishthira, that should be bestowed in<br>marriage upon such a son, who belongs to the order of the rearer himself,<br>All this is to be done only when the order of son's true mother cannot be<br>ascertained. Among sons, he that is born of a maiden and he that is born<br>of a mother that had conceived before her marriage but had brought him<br>fourth subsequent to that are regarded as very disgraceful and degraded.<br>Even those two, however, should receive the same rites of purification<br>that are laid down for the sons begotten by the father in lawful wedlock.<br>With respect to the son that becomes his sire's in consequence of his<br>birth in the sire's soil and of those sons that are called Apasadas and,<br>those conceived by the spouse in her maidenhood but brought forth after<br>marriage, Brahmanas and others should apply the same rites of<br>purification that hold good for their own orders. These are the<br>conclusions that are to be found in the scriptures with respect to the<br>different orders. I have thus told thee everything appertaining to thy<br>questions. What else dost thou wish to hear?"
