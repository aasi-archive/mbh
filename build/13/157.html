                            "Bhishma said, 'Hearing these words of the god of wind, Arjuna remained<br>silent. At this, the god of wind once more addressed him, saying, 'When<br>the denizens of heaven, with Indra at their head, found themselves within<br>the mouth of the Asura Mada, at that time Chyavana took away from them<br>the earth. Deprived previously of heaven and now shorn of the earth also,<br>the gods became very cheerless. Indeed, those high-souled ones, afflicted<br>with grief, then threw themselves unreservedly upon the Grandsire's<br>protection.'<br><br>"The gods said, 'O thou that art adored by all creatures of the universe,<br>the earth has been taken away from us by Chyavana, while we have been<br>deprived of heaven by the Kapas, O puissant one!'<br><br>"Brahmana said, 'Ye denizens of heaven, do you, with Indra at your head,<br>repair quickly and seek the protection of the Brahmanas. By gratifying<br>them you will succeed in regaining both the regions as before.' Thus<br>instructed by the Grandsire, the deities repaired to the Brahmanas and<br>became suppliants for their protection. The Brahmanas replied, enquiring,<br>'Whom shall we subjugate?' Thus asked, the deities said unto them, 'Do ye<br>subjugate the Kapas.' The Brahmanas then said, 'Bringing them down on the<br>earth first, we shall speedily subjugate them.' After this, the Brahmanas<br>commenced a rite having for its object the destruction of the Kapas. As<br>soon as this was heard of by the Kapas, they immediately despatched a<br>messenger of theirs, named Dhanin, unto those Brahmanas. Dhanin, coming<br>to them as they sat on the earth, thus delivered to them the message of<br>the Kapas. The Kapas are even like you all! (They are not inferior to any<br>of you). Hence, what will be the effect of these rites which you seem to<br>be bent upon achieving? All of them are well-conversant with the Vedas<br>and possessed of wisdom. All of them are mindful of sacrifices. All of<br>them have Truth for their vow, and for these reasons all of them are<br>regarded as equal to great Rishis. The goddess of Prosperity sports among<br>them, and they, in their turn, support her with reverence. They never<br>indulge in acts of fruitless congress with their wives, and they never<br>eat the flesh of such animals as have not been killed in sacrifices. They<br>pour libations on the blazing sacrificial fire (every day) and 'are<br>obedient to the behests of their preceptors and seniors. All of them are<br>of souls under perfect control, and never take any food without dividing<br>it duly among their children. They always proceed on cars and other<br>vehicles together (without any of them riding his own vehicle while<br>others journey on foot). They never indulge in acts of congress with<br>their spouses when the latter are in midst of their functional period.<br>They all act in such a way as to attain to regions of felicity hereafter.<br>Indeed, they are always righteous in their deeds. When women quick with<br>child or old men have not eaten, they never eat anything themselves. They<br>never indulge in play or sports of any kind in the forenoon. They never<br>sleep during the day. When the Kapas have these and many other virtues<br>and accomplishments, why, indeed, would you seek to subjugate them? You<br>should abstain from the endeavour! Verily, by such abstention ye would<br>achieve what is for your good.'<br><br>"The Brahmanas said, 'Oh, we shall subjugate the Kapas! In this matter,<br>we art one with the deities. Hence, the Kapas deserve slaughter at your<br>hands. As regards Dhanin, he should return whence he came! After this,<br>Dhanin, returning to the Kapas, said unto them, 'The Brahmanas are not<br>disposed to do you any good! 'Hearing this, all the Kapas took up their<br>weapons and proceeded towards the Brahmanas. The Brahmanas, beholding the<br>Kapas advancing against them with the standards of their cars upraised,<br>forthwith created certain blazing fires for the destruction of the Kapas.<br>Those eternal fires, created with the aid of Vedic Mantras, having<br>effected the destruction of the Kapas, began to shine in the firmament<br>like so many (golden) clouds. The gods, having assembled together in<br>battle, slew many of the Danavas. They did not know at that time that it<br>was the Brahmanas who had effected their destruction. Then Narada of<br>great energy, coming there, O king, informed the deities how their foes;<br>the Kapas, had been really slain by the Brahmanas of mighty energy (and<br>not by deities themselves). Hearing these words of Narada, the denizens<br>of heaven became highly gratified. They also applauded those regenerate<br>allies of theirs that were possessed of great fame. The energy and<br>prowess of the deities then began to increase, and worshipped in all the<br>worlds, they acquired also the boon of immortality!' After the god of<br>wind had said these words, king Arjuna worshipped him duly and addressing<br>him answered in these words, 'Hear, O mighty armed monarch, what Arjuna<br>said.'<br><br>"Arjuna said, O puissant god, always and by all means do I live for the<br>Brahmanas! Devoted to them, I worship them always! Through the grace of<br>Dattatreya I have obtained this might of mine! Through his grace have I<br>been able to accomplish great feats in the world and achieve high merit!<br>Oh, I have, with attention, heard of the achievements, O god of the wind,<br>of the Brahmanas with all their interesting details as recited by thee<br>truly.'<br><br>"The god of wind said, 'Do thou protect and cherish the Brahmanas, in the<br>exercise of those Kshatriya duties which are thine by birth. Do thou<br>protect them even as thou protectest thy own senses! There is danger to<br>thee from the race of Bhrigu! All that, however, will take place on a<br>distant day.'"
