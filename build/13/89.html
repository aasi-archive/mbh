                            "Bhishma continued, 'Listen to me, O Yudhishthira, as I tell thee what<br>those optional Sraddhas are that should be performed under the different<br>constellations and that were first spoken of by Yama unto king<br>Sasavindu.[402] That man who always performs the Sraddha under the<br>constellation Krittika is regarded as performing a sacrifice after<br>establishing the sacred fire. Such a person, freed from fear, ascends to<br>heaven with his children. He that is desirous of children should perform<br>the Sraddha under the constellation Rohini, while he that is desirous of<br>energy should do it under the constellation Mrigasiras. By performing the<br>Sraddha under the constellation Ardra, a man becomes the doer of fierce<br>deeds. A mortal, by performing the Sraddha under Punarvasu, makes such<br>again by agriculture. The man that is desirous of growth and advancement<br>should perform the Sraddha under Pushya. By doing it under the<br>constellation Aslesha one begets heroic children. By doing it under the<br>Maghas one attains to pre-eminence among kinsmen. By doing it under the<br>prior Phalgunis, the doer of it becomes endued with good fortune. By<br>doing the Sraddha under the later Phalgunis one attains to many children;<br>while by performing it under Hasta, one attains to the fruition of one's<br>wishes. By performing it under the constellation Chitra one obtains<br>children endued with great beauty. By doing it under the constellation<br>Swati, one makes much profit by trade. The man that desires children<br>acquires the fruition of his wish by performing the Sraddha under the<br>constellation Visakha. By doing it under Anuradha one becomes a king of<br>kings.[403] By making offerings in honour of the Pitris under the<br>constellation Jyeshtha with devotion and humility, one attains to<br>sovereignty, O foremost one of Kuru's race. By doing the Sraddha under<br>Mula one attains to health, and by doing it under the prior Ashadha, one<br>acquires excellent fame. By performing it under the later Ashadha one<br>succeeds in roving over the whole world, freed from every sorrow. By<br>doing it under the constellation Abhijit one attains to high knowledge.<br>By doing it under Sravana one, departing from this world, attains to a<br>very high end. The man that performs the Sraddha under the constellation<br>Dhanishtha becomes the ruler of a kingdom. By doing it under the<br>constellation presided over by Varuna (viz., Satabhisha), one attains to<br>success as a physician. By performing the Sraddha under the constellation<br>of the prior Bhadrapada one acquires large property in goats and sheep;<br>while by doing it under the later Bhadrapada one acquires thousands of<br>kine. By performing the Sraddha under the constellation Revati one<br>acquires much wealth in utensils of white brass and copper. By doing it<br>under Aswini one acquires many steeds, while under Bharani one attains to<br>longevity. Listening to these ordinances about the Sraddha, king<br>Sasavindu acted accordingly, and succeeded in easily subjugating and<br>ruling the whole earth.'"
