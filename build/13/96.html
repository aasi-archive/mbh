                            "Yudhishthira said, 'What did that foremost of ascetics, viz., Jamadagni<br>endued with great energy, do when thus besought by the maker of day?'"<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O descendant of Kuru, despite all the supplications of<br>Surya, the sage Jamadagni, endued with the effulgence of fire, continued<br>to cherish his anger. Then. O king, Surya, in the guise of a Brahmana,<br>bowed his head unto him and addressed him, with folded hands, in these<br>soft words. 'O regenerate Rishi, the sun is always in motion! How shalt<br>thou pierce the Lord of day who is continually moving forward?'"<br><br>"Jamadagni said, With the eye of knowledge I know thee to be both moving<br>and motionless! I shall surely read thee a lesson this day. At midday<br>thou seemest to stay in the heavens for a moment. It is then, O Surya,<br>that I shall pierce thee with my arrows! There is no swerving from this<br>my resolution!'"<br><br>"Surya said 'O regenerate Rishi, without doubt, thou knowest me, O best<br>of archers! But, O holy one, though I have offended, behold, I am a<br>suppliant for thy protection!'"<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'At this, the adorable Jamadagni smilingly addressed<br>the maker of day, saying, 'O Surya, when thou hast sought my protection,<br>thou hast nothing to fear! He would transcend the simplicity that exists<br>in Brahmanas, the stability that exists in the Earth, the mildness<br>existing in the Moon, the gravity existing in Varuna, the effulgence<br>existing in Agni, the brightness of Meru, and the heat of the sun, who<br>would slay a suppliant for protection! The man that can slay a suppliant<br>is capable of violating the bed of his preceptor, of slaying a Brahmana,<br>and of drinking alcohol. Do thou, therefore, think of some remedy for<br>this evil, by which people may be relieved when heated by the rays!'"<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'So saying, that excellent descendant of Bhrigu<br>remained silent for a while, and Surya forthwith made over to him an<br>umbrella and a pair of sandals.'"<br><br>"Surya said, 'Do thou, O great Rishi, take this umbrella wherewith the<br>head may be protected and my rays warded off. This pair of sandals is<br>made of leather for the protection of the feet. From this day forth the<br>gift of these articles in all religious rites shall be established as an<br>inflexible usage!'"<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'This custom of giving umbrellas and shoes was<br>introduced by Surya! O descendant of Bharata, these gifts are considered<br>meritorious in the three worlds. Do thou, therefore, give away umbrellas<br>and shoes to Brahmanas. I have no doubt that thou shalt then acquire<br>great religious merit by the act. O foremost one of Bharata's race, he<br>who gives away a white umbrella with a hundred ribs to a Brahmana,<br>attains to eternal felicity after death and resides in the region of<br>Indra, respected by Brahmanas, Apsaras, and Devas. O puissant one, he who<br>gives shoes to Snataka Brahmanas as also to Brahmanas practising the<br>rites of religion whose feet have become sore with the heat of the sun,<br>attains to regions coveted by the very deities. Such a man, O Bharata,<br>dwells in happiness in the highest Heaven after his death. O foremost one<br>of Bharata's race, I have thus recited to thee in full, the merits of<br>giving away shoes and umbrellas at religious ceremonies!'"
