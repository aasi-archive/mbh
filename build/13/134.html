                            "Skanda said, 'I shall now declare a duty that is approved of by me. Do<br>ye listen to it with concentrated attention. That person who takes a<br>little earth from the horns of a bull of blue complexion, smears his body<br>therewith for three days, and then performs his ablutions, acquires great<br>merits. Hear what those merits are. By such an act he would wash away<br>every stain and evil, and attain to sovereign sway hereafter. As many<br>times he takes his birth in this world, so many times does he become<br>celebrated for his heroism. Listen now to another mystery unknown to all.<br>Taking a vessel of copper and placing therein some cooked food after<br>having mixed it with honey, one should offer it as Vali unto the rising<br>moon on the evening of the day when that luminary is at full. Do ye<br>learn, with faith, what the merits are of the person that acts in this<br>way. The Sadhyas, the Rudras, the Adityas, the Viswedevas, the twin<br>Aswins, the Maruts, and the Vasus, all accept that offering. By such an<br>offering Soma increases as also the ocean, that vast receptacle of<br>waters. This duty that is declared by me and that is unknown to all, if<br>performed, is certainly fraught with great happiness.'<br><br>"Vishnu said, 'That person who, endued with faith and freed from malice,<br>listens every day with concentrated attention to the mysteries in respect<br>of religion and duty that are preserved by the high-souled deities and<br>those mysteries also of the same kind that are preserved by the Rishis,<br>has never to succumb to any evil. Such a person becomes also freed from<br>every fear. That man who, with his senses under thorough control, reads<br>these sections which treat of these auspicious and meritorious duties,<br>together with their mysteries,&#8212;duties that have been declared (by the<br>previous speakers), acquires all the merits that attach to their actual<br>performance. Sin can never overmaster him. Verily, such a man can never<br>be stained with faults of any kind. Indeed, one wins abundant merits by<br>reading these mysteries (as declared), or by reciting them to others, or<br>by hearing them recited. The deities and the Pitris eat, for ever the<br>Havya and the Kavya offered by such a creature. Both these, in<br>consequence of the virtues of the offerer become inexhaustible. Even such<br>is the merit that attaches to the person who, with concentrated<br>attention, recites these mysteries to foremost of Brahmanas on days of<br>the full moon or the new moon. Such a person, in consequence of such an<br>act, becomes steady in the observance of all duties. Beauty of form and<br>prosperity also become his. He succeeds, besides this, in becoming the<br>favourite, for all time, of the Rishis and the deities and the Pitris. If<br>a person becomes guilty of all sins save those which are classed as grave<br>or heinous, he becomes cleansed of them all by only listening to the<br>recitation of these mysteries about religion and duty.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Even these, O king of men, are the mysteries in<br>respect of religion and duty dwelling in the breasts of the deities. Held<br>in high respect by all the gods and promulgated by Vyasa, they have now<br>been declared by me for thy benefit. One who is conversant with religion<br>and duty thinks that this excellent knowledge is superior (in value) to<br>even the whole earth full of riches and wealth. This knowledge should not<br>be imparted to one that is bereft of faith, or to one that is an atheist,<br>or to one that has fallen away from the duties of his order, or to one<br>that is destitute of compassion, or to one that is devoted to the science<br>of empty disputations, or to one that is hostile to one's preceptors, or<br>to one that thinks all creatures to be different from oneself.'"
