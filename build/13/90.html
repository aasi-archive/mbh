                            "Yudhishthira said, 'It behoves thee, O foremost one of Kuru's race, to<br>tell me unto what kind of Brahmanas, O grandsire, should the offers made<br>at Sraddhas be given away.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, The Kshatriya who is conversant with the ordinances about<br>gift should never examine Brahmanas (when making gifts unto them). In all<br>acts, however, that relate to the worship of the deities and the Pitris,<br>an examination has been said to be proper. The deities are worshipped on<br>earth by men only when they are filled with devotion that comes from the<br>deities themselves. Hence, one should, approaching them, make gifts unto<br>all Brahmanas (without any examination of their merits), regarding such<br>gifts as are made to the deities themselves. In Sraddhas, however, O<br>monarch, the man of intelligence should examine the Brahmanas (to be<br>employed for assisting the doers of the Sraddha in getting through the<br>ritual and making gifts unto them of the offerings made to the Pitris).<br>Such examination should concern itself with their birth and conduct and<br>age and appearance and learning and nobility (or otherwise) of parentage.<br>Amongst the Brahmanas there are some that pollute the line and some that<br>sanctify it. Listen to me, O king, as I tell thee who those Brahmanas are<br>that should be excluded from the line.[404] He that is full of guile, or<br>he that is guilty of foeticide, or he that is ill of consumption, or he<br>that keeps animals, of is destitute of Vedic study, or is a common<br>servant of a village, or lives upon the interest of loans, or he that is<br>a singer, or he that sells all articles, or he that is guilty of arson,<br>or he that is a poisoner or he that is a pimp by profession, or he that<br>sells Soma, or he that is a professor of palmistry, or he that is in the<br>employ of the king, or he that is seller of oil, or he that is a cheat<br>and false swearer, or he that has a quarrel with his father, or he that<br>tolerates a paramour of his wife in his house, or he that has been<br>cursed, or he that is a thief, or he that lives by some mechanical art,<br>or he that puts on disguises, or he that is deceitful in his behaviour,<br>or he that is hostile to those he calls his friends, or he that is an<br>adulterer, or he that is a preceptor of Sudras, or he that has betaken<br>himself to the profession of arms, or he that wanders with dogs (for<br>hunting), or he that has been bit by a dog, or he that has wedded before<br>his elder brothers, or he that seems to have undergone circumcision,[405]<br>he that violates the bed of his preceptor, he that is an actor or mime,<br>he that lives by setting up a deity and he that lives by calculating the<br>conjunctions of stars and planets and asterisms[406], are regarded as fit<br>to be excluded from the line. Persons conversant with the Vedas say that<br>the offerings made at Sraddhas, if eaten by such Brahmanas, go to fill<br>the stomachs of Rakshasas (instead of filling those of the Pitris), O,<br>Yudhishthira. That person who having eaten at a Sraddha does not abstain<br>that day from study of the Vedas or who has sexual congress that day with<br>a Sudra woman, must know that his Pitris, in consequence of such acts of<br>his, have to lie for a month on his dung. The offerings made at Sraddhas<br>if presented to a Brahmana who sells Soma, become converted into human<br>ordure; if presented to a Brahmana who is engaged in the practice of<br>Medicine, they become converted into pus and blood; if presented to one<br>who lives by setting up a deity, they fail to produce any fruit; if<br>presented to one who lives upon the interest of loans they lead to<br>infamy; if presented to one who is engaged in trade, they become<br>productive of no fruits either here or hereafter. If presented to a<br>Brahmana who is born of a widowed mother (by a second husband), they<br>become as fruitless as libations poured on ashes[407]. They who present<br>the Havya and Kavya (offered at Sraddhas) unto such Brahmanas as are<br>divested of the duties ordained for them and of those rules of good<br>conduct that persons of their order should observe, find such presents<br>productive of no merits hereafter. That man of little intelligence who<br>makes gifts of such articles unto such men knowing their dispositions,<br>obliges, by such conduct, his Pitris to eat human ordure in the next<br>world. Thou shouldst know that these wretches among Brahmanas deserve to<br>be excluded from the line. Those Brahmanas also of little energy who are<br>engaged in instructing Sudras are of the same class. A Brahmana that is<br>blind stains sixty individual of the line; one that is destitute of<br>virile power a hundred; while one that is afflicted with white leprosy<br>stains as many as he looks upon, O king. Whatever offerings made at<br>Sraddhas are eaten by one with his head wrapped round with a cloth,<br>whatever is eaten by one with face southwards, and whatever is eaten with<br>shoes or sandals on all goes to gratify the Asuras. Whatever, again, is<br>given with malice, and whatever is given without reverence, have been<br>ordained by Brahmana himself as the portion of the prince of Asuras<br>(viz., Vali). Dogs, and such Brahmanas as are polluters of lines, should<br>not be allowed to cast their eyes upon the offerings made at Sraddhas.<br>For this reason, Sraddhas should be performed in a spot that is properly<br>hedged around or concealed from the view. That spot should also be strewn<br>with sesame seeds. That Sraddha which is performed without sesame seeds,<br>or that which is done by a person in anger, has its Havi robbed by<br>Rakshasas and Pisachas. Commensurate with the number of Brahmanas seen by<br>one that deserves to be excluded from the line, is the loss of merit he<br>causes of the foolish performer of the Sraddha who invites him to the<br>feast.<br><br>'I shall now, O chief of Bharata's race, tell thee who are sanctifiers of<br>the line. Do thou find them out by examination. All those Brahmanas that<br>are cleansed by knowledge, Vedic study, and vows and observances, and<br>they that are of good and righteous behaviour, should be known as<br>sanctifiers of everything. I shall now tell thee who deserve to sit in<br>the line. Thou shouldst know them to be such whom I shall indicate<br>presently. He that is conversant with the three Nachiketas, he that has<br>set up the five sacrificial fires, he that knows the five Suparnas, he<br>that is conversant with the six branches (called Angas) of the Veda, he<br>that is a descendant of sires who were engaged in teaching the Vedas and<br>is himself engaged in teaching, he that is well-conversant with the<br>Chhandas, he that is acquainted with the Jeshtha Saman, he that is<br>obedient to the sway of his parents, he that is conversant with the Vedas<br>and whose ancestors have been so for ten generations, he that has<br>congress with only his wedded wives and this at their seasons, and he who<br>has been cleansed by knowledge, by the Veda, and by vows and<br>observances,&#8212;even such a Brahmana,&#8212;sanctifies the line. He who reads<br>the Atharva-siras, who is devoted to the observance of Brahmacharya<br>practices, and who is steady in observance of righteous vows, who is<br>truthful and of righteous conduct, and who is duly observant of the<br>duties laid down for his order, they also that have undergone fatigue and<br>labour for bathing in the waters of tirthas, that have undergone the<br>final bath after performing sacrifices with proper Mantras that are freed<br>from the sway of wrath, that are not restless, that are endued with<br>forgiving dispositions, that are self-restrained masters of their senses,<br>and they are devoted to the good of all creatures,&#8212;these should be<br>invited to Sraddhas. Anything given to these becomes inexhaustible. These<br>indeed, are sanctifiers of lines. There are others also, highly blessed,<br>that should be regarded as sanctifiers of the line. They are Yatis and<br>those that are conversant with the religion of Moksha, and they that are<br>devoted to Yoga, and they that properly observe excellent vows and they<br>that, with collected mind recite (sacred) histories unto foremost of<br>Brahmanas. They that are conversant with Bhashyas, they also that are<br>devoted to grammatical studies, they that study the Puranas and they that<br>study the Dharmasastras and having studied them (i.e., the Puranas and<br>Dharmasastras) act up to the standard laid down in them, he that has<br>lived (for the stated period) in the abode of his preceptor, he that is<br>truthful in speech, he that is a giver of thousands, they that are<br>foremost in (their knowledge of) all the Vedas and the scriptural and<br>philosophical aphorisms,&#8212;these sanctify the line as far they look at it.<br>And because they sanctify all who sit in the line, therefore are they<br>called sanctifiers of lines. Utterers of Brahma say that even a single<br>person that happens to be the descendant of sires who were teachers of<br>the Veda and that is himself a Vedic teacher, sanctifies full seven miles<br>around him. If he that is not a Ritwik and that is not a Vedic teacher<br>takes the foremost seat in a Sraddha, with even the permission of the<br>other Ritwiks there present, he is said to take (by that act of his) the<br>sins of all who may be sitting in the line. If, on the other hand, he<br>happens to be conversant with the Vedas and freed from all those faults<br>that are regarded as capable of polluting the line, he shall not, O king,<br>be regarded as fallen (by taking the foremost seat in a Sraddha). Such a<br>man would then be really a sanctifier of the line. For these reasons, O<br>king, thou shouldst properly examine the Brahmanas before inviting them<br>to Sraddhas. Thou shouldst invite only such among them as are devoted to<br>the duties laid down for their order, and as are born in good families,<br>and as are possessed of great learning. He who performs Sraddhas for<br>feeding only his friends and whose Havi does not gratify the deities and<br>the Pitris, fails to ascend to Heaven. He who collects his friends and<br>relatives only on the occasion of the Sraddha he performs (without<br>keeping an eye on properly honouring deserving persons by inviting and<br>feeding them), fails to proceed (after death) by the path of the deities<br>(which is a lighted one and free from all afflictions and impediments).<br>The man who makes the Sraddha he performs an occasion for only gathering<br>his friends, never succeeds in ascending to heaven. Verily, the man who<br>converts the Sraddha into an occasion for treating his friends, becomes<br>dissociated from heaven even like a bird dissociated from the perch when<br>the chain tying it breaks.[408] Therefore, he that performs a Sraddha<br>should not honour (on such occasions) his friends. He may make gifts of<br>wealth unto them on other occasions by collecting them together. The Havi<br>and the Kavi offered at Sraddhas should be served unto them that are<br>neither friends nor foes but are only indifferent or neutral. As seed<br>sown on a sterile soil does not sprout forth, or as one that has not sown<br>does not get a share of the produce, even so that Sraddha the offerings<br>in which are eaten by an unworthy person, yields no fruit either here or<br>hereafter.[409] That Brahmana who is destitute of Vedic study is like a<br>fire made by burning grass or straw; and becomes soon extinguished even<br>like such a fire. The offerings made at Sraddhas should not be given to<br>him even as libations should not be poured on the ashes of the<br>sacrificial fire. When the offerings made at Sraddhas are exchanged by<br>the performers with one another (instead of being given away unto worthy<br>persons), they come to be regarded as Pisacha presents. Such offerings<br>gratify neither the gods nor the Pitris. Instead of reaching the other<br>world, they wander about even here like a cow that has lost her calf<br>wandering about within the fold. As those libations of ghee that are<br>poured upon the extinguished ashes of a sacrificial fire never reach<br>either the gods or the Pitris, after the same manner a gift that is made<br>to a dancer or a singer or a Dakshina presented to a lying or deceitful<br>person, produces no merit. The Dakshina that is presented to a lying or<br>deceitful person destroys both the giver and the receiver without<br>benefiting them in any respect. Such a Dakshina is destructive and highly<br>censurable. The Pitris of the person making it have to fall down from the<br>path of the deities. The gods know them to be Brahmanas who always tread,<br>O Yudhishthira, within the bounds set up by the Rishis who are conversant<br>with all duties, and who have a firm faith in their efficacy. Those<br>Brahmanas that are devoted to Vedic study, to knowledge, to penances, and<br>to acts, O Bharata, should be known as Rishis. The offerings made at<br>Sraddhas should be given unto those that are devoted to knowledge.<br>Verily, they are to be regarded as men who never speak ill of the<br>Brahmanas. Those men should never be fed on occasions of Sraddhas who<br>speak ill of Brahmanas in course of conversation in the midst of<br>assemblies. If Brahmanas, O king, be calumniated, they would destroy<br>three generations of the calumniator.[410] This is the declaration, O<br>king, of the Vaikhanasa Rishis. Brahmanas conversant with the Vedas<br>should be examined from a distance. Whether one likes them or feels a<br>dislike for them, one should give unto such Brahmanas the offerings made<br>at Sraddhas. That man who feeds thousands upon thousands of false<br>Brahmanas acquires merit that is attainable by feeding even one Brahmana<br>if the latter happens to be possessed of a knowledge of the Vedas, O<br>Bharata!"
