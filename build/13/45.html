                            "Yudhishthira said, 'If a person, after having given dowry for a maiden,<br>goes away, how should the maiden's father or other kinsmen who are<br>competent to bestow her, act? Do tell me this, O grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Such a maiden, if she happens to be the daughter of a<br>sonless and rich father, should be maintained by the father (in view of<br>the return of him who has given the dowry). Indeed, if the father does<br>not return the dowry unto the kinsmen of the giver, the maiden should be<br>regarded as belonging to the giver of the dowry. She may even raise<br>offspring for the giver (during his absence) by any of those means that<br>are laid down in the scriptures. No person, however, can be competent to<br>wed her according to due rites. Commanded by her sire, the princess<br>Savitri had in days of old chosen a husband and united herself with him.<br>This act of hers is applauded by some; but others conversant with the<br>scriptures, condemn it. Others that are righteous have not acted in this<br>way. Others hold that the conduct of the righteous should ever be<br>regarded as the foremost evidence of duty or morality.[287] Upon this<br>subject Sukratu, the grandson of the high-souled Janaka, the ruler of the<br>Videhas, has declared the following opinion. There is the well-known<br>declaration of the scriptures that women are incompetent to enjoy freedom<br>at any period of their life. If this were not the path trodden by the<br>righteous, how could this scriptural declaration exist? As regards the<br>righteous, therefore, how can there be any question or doubt in respect<br>of this matter? How can people condemn that declaration by choosing to<br>conduct themselves otherwise? The unrighteous dereliction of eternal<br>usage is regarded as the practice of the Asuras. Such practice we never<br>hear of in the conduct of the ancients[288] the relationship of husband<br>and wife is very subtile (having reference to the acquisition of destiny,<br>and, therefore, capable of being understood with the aid of only the<br>inspired declarations in scriptures). It is different from the natural<br>relationship of male and female which consists only in the desire for<br>sexual pleasure. This also was said by the king alluded to of Janaka's<br>race.'[289]<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Upon what authority is the wealth of men inherited<br>(by others when they happen to have daughters)? In respect of her sire<br>the daughter should be regarded the same as the son.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The son is even as one's own self, and the daughter is<br>like unto the son. How, therefore, can another take the wealth when one<br>lives in one's own self in the form of one's daughter? Whatever wealth is<br>termed the Yautuka property of the mother, forms the portion of the<br>maiden daughter. If the maternal grandfather happens to die without<br>leaving sons, the daughter's son should inherit it. The daughter's son<br>offers pindas to his own father and the father of his mother. Hence, in<br>accordance with considerations of justice, there is no difference between<br>the son and the daughter's son. When a person has got only a daughter and<br>she has been invested by him with the status of a son, if he then happens<br>to have a son, such a son (instead of taking all the wealth of his sire)<br>shares the inheritance with the daughter.[290] When, again, a person has<br>got a daughter and she has been invested by him with the status of a son,<br>if he then happens to take a son by adoption or purchase then the<br>daughter is held to be superior to such a son (for she takes three shares<br>of her father's wealth, the son's share being limited to only the<br>remaining two). In the following case I do not see any reason why the<br>status of a daughter's son should attach to the sons of one's daughter.<br>The case is that of the daughter who has been sold by her sire. The sons<br>born of a daughter that has been sold by her sire for actual price,<br>belong exclusively to their father (even if he do not beget them himself<br>but obtain them according to the rules laid down in the scriptures for<br>the raising of issue through the agency of others). Such sons can never<br>belong, even as daughter's sons, to their maternal grandfather in<br>consequence of his having sold their mother for a price and lost all his<br>rights in or to her by that act.[291] Such sons, again, become full of<br>malice, unrighteous in conduct, the misappropriators of other people's<br>wealth, and endued with deceit and cunning. Having sprung from that<br>sinful form of marriage called Asura, the issue becomes wicked in<br>conduct. Persons acquainted with the histories of olden times, conversant<br>with duties, devoted to the scriptures and firm in maintaining the<br>restraints therein laid down, recite in this connection some metrical<br>lines sung in days of yore by Yama. Even this is what Yama had sung. That<br>man who acquires wealth by selling his own son, or who bestows his<br>daughter after accepting a dower for his own livelihood, has to sink in<br>seven terrible hells one after another, known by the name of Kalasutra.<br>There that wretch has to feed upon sweat and urine and stools during the<br>whole time. In that form of marriage which is called Arsha, the person<br>who weds has to give a bull and a cow and the father of the maiden<br>accepts the gift. Some characterise this gift as a dowry (or price),<br>while some are of opinion that it should not be regarded in that light.<br>The true opinion, however, is that a gift for such a purpose, be it of<br>small value or large, should, O king, be regarded as dowry or price, and<br>the bestowal of the daughter under such circumstances should be viewed as<br>a sale. Notwithstanding the fact of its having been practised by a few<br>persons it can never be taken as the eternal usage. Other forms of<br>marriage are seen, practised by men, such as marrying girls after<br>abducting them by force from amidst their kinsmen. Those persons who have<br>sexual intercourse with a maiden, after reducing her to subjection by<br>force, are regarded as perpetrators of sin. They have to sink in darkest<br>hell.[292] Even a human being with whom one has no relationship of blood<br>should not form the subject of sale. What need then be said of one's own<br>issue? With the wealth that is acquired by doing sinful deeds, no action<br>leading to merit can be performed.'"
