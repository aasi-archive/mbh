                            'Bhishma said, One day the chief of the celestials assuming a form of<br>celestial beauty, came to the retreat of the Rishi, thinking that the<br>opportunity he had been expecting had at last come. Verily, O king,<br>having assumed a form unrivalled for comeliness and exceedingly tempting<br>to women and highly agreeable to look at, Indra entered the ascetic's<br>asylum. He saw the body of Vipula staying in a sitting posture, immovable<br>as a stake, and with eyes destitute of vision, like a picture drawn on<br>the canvas. And he saw also that Ruchi was seated there, adorned with<br>eyes whose ends were extremely beautiful, possessed of full and rotund<br>hips, and having a deep and swelling bosom. Her eyes were large and<br>expansive like the petals of the lotus, and her face was as beautiful and<br>sweet as the moon at full. Seeing Indra come in that guise, the lady<br>wished to rise up and offer him a welcome. Her wonder having been excited<br>at the unrivalled beauty of form which the person possessed, she very<br>much wished to ask him as to who he was. Although, however, she wished to<br>rise up and offer him a welcome, yet her limbs having been restrained by<br>Vipula who was dwelling within her, she failed, O king, to do what she<br>wished. In fact, she was unable to move from the place where she sat. The<br>chief of the celestials then addressed her in agreeable words uttered<br>with a sweet voice. Indeed, he said, 'O thou of sweet smiles, know that I<br>am Indra, arrived here for thy sake! Know, O sweet lady, that I am<br>afflicted by the deity of desire provoked by thoughts of thee! O thou of<br>beautiful brows, I have come to thy presence. Time wears off.'[274] These<br>words that Indra spoke were heard by the ascetic Vipula. Remaining within<br>the body of his preceptor's wife, he saw everything that occurred. The<br>lady of faultless beauty, though she heard what Indra said, was, however,<br>unable to rise up for welcoming or honouring the chief of the celestials.<br>Her senses restrained by Vipula, she was unable to utter a word in reply.<br>That scion of Bhrigu's race, of mighty energy, judging from the<br>indications afforded by the body of his preceptor's wife that she was not<br>unwilling to receive Indra with kindness, restrained her limbs and senses<br>all the more effectually, O king, by his Yoga-powers. With Yoga-bonds he<br>bound up all her senses. Beholding her seated without any indication of<br>agitation on her person, the lord of Sachi, abashed a little, once more<br>addressed that lady who was stupefied by the Yoga-powers of her husband's<br>disciple, in these words, 'Come, come, O sweet lady!' Then the lady<br>endeavoured to answer him. Vipula, however restrained the words that she<br>intended to utter. The words, therefore, that actually escaped her lips<br>(under the influence of Vipula) were. 'What is the reason of thy coming<br>hither?' These words adorned with grammatical refinements, issued out of<br>her mouth that was as beautiful as the moon.[275] Subject to the<br>influence of another, she uttered these words, but became rather ashamed<br>for uttering them. Hearing her, Purandara became exceedingly cheerless.<br>Observing that awkward result, the chief of the celestials, O monarch,<br>adorned with a thousand eyes saw every thing with his spiritual eye. He<br>then beheld the ascetic staying within the body of the lady. Indeed, the<br>ascetic remained within the body of his preceptor's wife like an image or<br>reflection on a mirror. Beholding the ascetic endued with the terrible<br>might of penances, Purandara, O monarch, fearing the Rishi's curse,<br>trembled in fright. Vipula then, possessed of high ascetic might, left<br>the body of his preceptor's wife and returned to his own body that was<br>lying near. He then addressed the terrified Indra in the following words:<br><br>"Vipula said, 'O wicked-souled Purandara, O thou of sinful mind, O wretch<br>that hast no control over thy senses, neither the deities nor human<br>beings will worship thee for any length of time! Hast thou forgotten it.<br>O Sakra,&#8212;does it not still dwell in thy remembrance,&#8212;that Gautama had<br>cursed thee in consequence of which thy body became disfigured with a<br>thousand sex-marks, which, owing to the Rishi's compassion, were<br>afterwards changed into organs of vision? I know that thou art of an<br>exceedingly foolish understanding, that thy soul is uncleansed, and that<br>thou art of an exceedingly unstable mind! O fool, know that this lady is<br>being protected by me. O sinful wretch, go back to that place whence thou<br>tamest. O thou of foolish soul, I do not consume thee today into ashes<br>with my energy. Verily, I am filled with compassion for thee. It is for<br>this that I do not, O Vasava, wish to burn thee. My preceptor, endued<br>with great intelligence, is possessed of terrible might. With eyes<br>blazing with wrath, he would, if he saw thee, have burnt thy sinful self<br>today. Thou shouldst not, O Sakra, do like this again. The Brahmanas<br>should be regarded by thee. See that thou dost not, with thy sons and<br>counsellors, meet with destruction, afflicted by the might of the<br>Brahmanas. Thou thinkest that thou art an immortal and that, therefore,<br>art at liberty to proceed in this way. Do not, however, disregard the<br>Brahmanas. Know that there is nothing unattainable by penance.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Hearing these words of the high-souled Vipula, Sakra<br>without saying anything, and overwhelmed with shame, made himself<br>invisible. A moment after he had gone away, Devasarman of high ascetic<br>merit, having accomplished the sacrifice he had intended to perform, came<br>back to his own asylum. When his preceptor came back, Vipula, who had<br>done an agreeable deed, gave, unto him his wife of faultless beauty whom<br>he had successfully protected against the machinations of Indra. Of<br>tranquil soul and full of reverence for his preceptor, Vipula<br>respectfully saluted him and stood in his presence with a fearless heart.<br>After his preceptor had rested a while and when he was seated with his<br>wife on the same seat, Vipula represented unto him everything that Sakra<br>had done. Hearing these words of Vipula, that foremost of Munis, endued<br>with great prowess, became highly gratified with him for his conduct and<br>disposition, his penances, and his observances. Observing Vipula's<br>conduct towards himself&#8212;his preceptor&#8212;and his devotion also, and noting<br>his steadiness in virtue, the puissant Devasarman exclaimed, "Excellent,<br>excellent!' The righteous-souled Devasarman, receiving his virtuous<br>disciple with a sincere welcome, honoured him with a boon. Indeed,<br>Vipula, steady in virtue obtained from his preceptor the boon that he<br>would never swerve or fall away from righteousness. Dismissed by his<br>preceptor he left his abode and practised the most severe austerities.<br>Devasarman also, of severe penances, with his spouse, began from that day<br>to live in those solitary woods, perfectly fearless of him who had slain<br>Vala and Vritra.'"
