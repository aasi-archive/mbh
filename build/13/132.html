                            "Bhishma said, 'After this, the Grandsire Brahman, sprang from the<br>primeval lotus and resembling the lotus (in agreeableness and fragrance),<br>addressed the deities with Vasava, the lord of Sachi, at their<br>head,&#8212;Yonder sits the mighty Naga who is a resident of the nether<br>regions. Endued with great strength and energy, and with great prowess<br>also, his name is Renuka. He is certainly a great being. Those mighty<br>elephants endued with great energy and power, who hold the entire earth<br>with her hills, waters, and lakes should be interviewed by this Renuka at<br>your request. Let Renuka go to them and ask them about the mysteries of<br>religion or duty.&#8212;Hearing these words of the Grandsire, the deities,<br>with well-pleased minds commissioned (the elephant) Renuka to where those<br>upholders of the world are.'"<br><br>"Renuka, proceeding to where those elephants are, addressed them, saying,<br>'Ye mighty creatures, I have been commanded by the deities and the Pitris<br>to question you about the mysteries of religion and duty. I desire to<br>bear you discourse on that subject in detail. Ye highly blessed ones, do<br>ye discourse on the subject as your wisdom may dictate.'<br><br>"The (eight) elephants standing in the eight quarters said, 'On the<br>auspicious eighth day of the dark fortnight in the month of Karttika when<br>the constellation Aslesha is in the ascendant, one should make gifts of<br>treacle and rice. Casting aside wrath, and living on regulated diet, one<br>should make these offerings at a Sraddha, uttering these mantras the<br>while&#8212;Let Valadeva and other Nagas possessed of great strength, let<br>other mighty snakes of huge bodies that are indestructible and eternal,<br>and let all the other great snakes that have taken their birth in their<br>race, make Vali offerings to me for the enhancement of my strength and<br>energy. Verily, let my strength be as great as that of the blessed<br>Narayana when he raised the submerged Earth!&#8212;Uttering these mantras, one<br>should make Vali offerings upon an ant-hill. When the maker of day<br>retires to his chambers in the west, upon the ant-hill selected should<br>offerings be made of raw sugar and rice. The ant-hill should previously<br>be scattered with Gajendra flowers, Offerings should also be made of blue<br>cloths and fragrant unguents. If offerings are made in this way, those<br>beings that live in the nether regions, bearing the weight of the upper<br>regions upon their heads or shoulders, become well-pleased and gratified.<br>As regards ourselves, we also do not feel the labour of upholding the<br>Earth, in consequence of such offerings being made to us. Afflicted with<br>the burden we bear, even this is what we think (beneficial for men),<br>without the slightest regard for selfish concerns. Brahmanas and<br>Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras, by observing this rule for a full<br>year, fasting on each occasion, acquire great merits from such gifts. We<br>think that the making of such Vali offerings on the ant-hill is really<br>fraught with very superior merits. By making such offerings, one is<br>regarded as doing the duties of hospitality for a hundred years to all<br>the mighty elephants that exist in the three worlds.' Hearing these words<br>of the mighty elephants, the deities and the Pitris and the highly<br>blessed Rishis, all applauded Renuka."
