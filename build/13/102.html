                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, it has been said that all pious men<br>attain to the same region after death. Is it true, O Bharata, that there<br>is difference of position or status among them?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'By different deeds, O son of Pritha, men attain to<br>different regions. They who are righteous in conduct attain to regions of<br>felicity, while they who are sinful attain to regions that are fraught<br>with misery. In this connection is cited the old narrative of the<br>discourse, O son, between the ascetic Gautama and Vasava. A certain<br>Brahmana of the name of Gautama, mild and self-restrained and with all<br>his senses under complete control, beheld an infant elephant that had<br>lost his mother and that was exceedingly cheerless on that account. Full<br>of compassion and steady in the observance of his vows, the ascetic<br>nursed that infant animal. After a long time the little beast grew up<br>into a large and mighty elephant. One day, Indra, assuming the form of<br>king Dhritarashtra, seized that mighty elephant which was as huge as a<br>hill and from whose rent temples the juice was trickling down. Beholding<br>the elephant dragged away, the great ascetic Gautama of rigid vows<br>addressed king Dhritarashtra and said, 'O ungrateful Dhritarashtra, do<br>not rob me of this elephant. It is looked upon by me as a son and I have<br>reared it with much pain. It is said that between the righteous,<br>friendship springs up if only they exchange seven words.[452] Thou<br>shouldst see, O king, that the sin of injuring a friend does not touch<br>thee! It behoveth thee not, O king, to take away by force this elephant<br>that brings me my fuel and water, that protects my asylum when I am away,<br>that exceedingly docile and obedient to his instructor, that is mindful<br>of doing all the offices that his preceptor commands, that is mild and<br>well-broken, and that is grateful and very dear to me! Indeed, thou<br>shouldst not bear it away, disregarding my protestations and cries!'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'I shall give thee a thousand kine, a hundred<br>maid-servants, and five hundred pieces of gold. I shall also, O great<br>Rishi, give thee diverse other kinds of wealth. What use can Brahmanas<br>have with elephants?'<br><br>"Gautama said, Keep, O king, thy kine and maid-servants and coins of gold<br>and various gems and diverse other kinds of wealth! What, O monarch, have<br>Brahmanas to do with wealth?'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Brahmana, have no use for elephants. Verily, O<br>learned Brahmana, elephants are meant for persons of the royal order. In<br>taking away an animal, viz., this foremost of elephants, for my use as<br>vehicle, I cannot be regarded as committing any sin. Do thou cease<br>obstructing me in this way, O Gautama!'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'O illustrious king, repairing even to that region of Yama<br>where the righteous live in joy and the sinful in grief, I shall take<br>from thee this my elephant!'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'They that are destitute of (religious) acts, they<br>that have no faith and are atheists, they that are of sinful souls and<br>are always engaged in gratifying their senses, only they have to go to<br>the region of Yama and endure the misery he inflicts. Dhritarashtra shall<br>go to a higher region, and not thither!'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'The region of Yama is such that men are there controlled.<br>No untruth can be told there. Only truth prevails in that place. There<br>the weak persecute the strong. Repairing. thither I shall force thee to<br>yield up this elephant to me!'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Only those persons, that intoxicated with pride,<br>conduct themselves towards their eldest sister and father and mother as<br>towards foes, have to repair, O great ascetic, to such a region. I shall<br>repair to a higher region. Indeed, Dhritarashtra shall not have to go<br>thither!'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'The region, called Mandakini, of king Vaisravana is<br>attained by those highly blessed persons for whom are every joy and<br>comfort. There Gandharvas and Yakshas and Apsaras live (gladdening all<br>the denizens with enchanting dances and music). Repairing even thither, O<br>king, I shall force thee to yield up this elephant to me!'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Those persons who regard hospitality to guests as a<br>vow, who are observant of good vows (having other objects), who give<br>shelter to Brahmanas, and who eat what remains after distribution among<br>all those that are dependent upon them, adorn the region called Mandakini<br>of Kuvera. (I shall not go thither, for a higher region is reserved for<br>me)!'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'If thou repairest to those delightful woods decked with<br>flowers, that stand on the summit of Meru, that echo with melodious voice<br>of Kinnaris, and that are graced with beautiful Jamvus of wide-spreading<br>branches, I shall proceed even thither and force thee to yield up this<br>elephant to me!'<br><br>'Dhritarashtra said, 'Those Brahmanas that are endued with mild<br>dispositions, that are devoted to truth, that are possessed of great<br>learning in the scriptures, that are compassionate unto all creatures,<br>that study the Puranas with all the histories, that pour libations on the<br>sacred fire and make gifts of honey unto the Brahmanas, repair to such<br>regions, O great Rishi! I shall repair to a region that is higher. Indeed<br>Dhritarashtra shall not go thither. If thou art acquainted with any other<br>well-known region of felicity, speak unto me, for I shall repair even<br>thither!'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'If thou proceedest to the woods owned by Narada and held<br>dear by him, that are adorned with flowers and that echo with the<br>melodious songs of the prince of Kinnaras, and that are the eternal abode<br>of Gandharvas and Apsaras, I shall follow thee thither and force thee to<br>yield up this elephant to me!'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'They who never solicit alms, they who cultivate<br>music and dancing, and always rove about in joy, proceed to such regions.<br>O great Rishi, I shall repair to a region that is higher. Indeed,<br>Dhritarashtra shall not have to go thither!'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'If thou goest to that region where the Uttara-Kurus blaze<br>in beauty and pass their days in gladness, O king, in the company of the<br>very deities, where those beings that have their origin in fire, those<br>that have their origin in water, and those having their origin in<br>mountains, reside in happiness, and where Sakra raineth down the fruition<br>of every wish, and where women live in perfect freedom, unrestrained by<br>rules of any kind regulating their conduct of motions, and where there is<br>no feeling of jealousy between the sexes,&#8212;if thou repairest thither,<br>even thither shall I proceed and force thee to yield up this elephant to<br>me!'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Those men that are freed from desire with respect<br>to all articles of enjoyment, that abstain from meat, that never take up<br>the rod of chastisement, and never inflict the least harm on mobile and<br>immobile creatures, that have constituted themselves the soul of all<br>creatures, that are entirely freed from the idea of meum, that have cast<br>off attachments of every kind, that regard gain and loss as also praise<br>and blame as equal,&#8212;only those men, O great Rishi, repair to such<br>regions. I shall repair to a higher region. Verily, Dhritarashtra shall<br>not go thither!'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'Next to these blaze in beauty those eternal regions,<br>redolent with excellent perfumes, that are free from passions of every<br>kind and that are destitute of sorrow. These constitute the abode of the<br>high-souled king Soma. If thou repairest thither, even thither shall I<br>proceed and force thee to yield up this elephant to me!'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Those men that always make gifts without receiving<br>any gift, who never accept any service from others, who own nothing which<br>they cannot give to a deserving person, who are hospitable to all<br>creatures, who are inclined to show grace to every one, who are endued<br>with forgiving dispositions, who never speak ill of others, who protect<br>all creatures by throwing over them the shroud of compassion, and who are<br>always righteous in their behaviour,&#8212;only those men, O great Rishi,<br>proceed to such regions. I shall proceed to a higher region. Verily,<br>Dhritarashtra shall not go there!'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'Next to these blaze in beauty other regions that are<br>eternal, free from passion and darkness and sorrow, and that lie at the<br>foot of the high-souled deity of the Sun. If thou repairest thither, even<br>thither shall I go and force thee to yield up this elephant to me!'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Those men that are attentive to the study of the<br>Vedas, that are devoted to the service of their preceptors, that are<br>observant of penances and excellent vows, that are firm in truth, that<br>never utter anything that smacks of disobedience or enmity to their<br>preceptors, that are always alert, and ever ready in service of seniors<br>and preceptors,&#8212;they repair, O great Rishi, to such regions, they that<br>are pure (of mind and body), that are endued with cleansed souls, that<br>are of restrained speech, that are firm in truth, and that are<br>well-versed in the Vedas. I shall proceed to a higher region! Verily,<br>Dhritarashtra shall not go thither!'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'Next to those are the eternal regions that blaze in<br>beauty, that are redolent with excellent perfumes, that are free from<br>passion, and that are free from every sorrow. They constitute the abode<br>of the high-souled king Varuna. If thou proceedest thither, even thither<br>shall I go and force thee to yield up this elephant to me!'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Those men who worship the deities by observing the<br>vow called Chaturmasya, that perform a hundred and ten sacrifices, that<br>pour libations every day on their sacred fire with devotion and faith for<br>three years agreeably with the ordinances declared in the Vedas, that<br>bear without flinching the burden of all duties, that walk steadily along<br>the way trod by the righteous, that steadily sustain the course of<br>conduct followed by the righteous-souled,&#8212;only they repair to such<br>regions. I shall repair to a higher region. Verily, Dhritarashtra shall<br>not go thither!'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'Above them are the regions of Indra, free from passion<br>and sorrow, that are difficult of access and coveted by all men.<br>Proceeding even to the abode of Indra himself of mighty energy, I shall,<br>O king, force thee to yield up this elephant to me!'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'He who lives for a hundred years, who is endued<br>with heroism, who studies the Vedas, and who performs sacrifices with<br>devotion, verity, such men proceed to the region of Sakra. I shall repair<br>to a higher region. Verily, Dhritarashtra shall not go there!'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'Above the Heavens are the regions of the Prajapatis of<br>superior felicity abounding in every happiness, and divested of sorrow.<br>Belonging to those puissant ones from whom the creation has sprung, they<br>are coveted by all persons. If thou repairest thither, even thither shall<br>I go and force thee to yield up this elephant to me!'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Those kings that have bathed upon the completion of<br>the Rajasuya sacrifice, that are endued with righteous souls, that have<br>protected their subjects properly, and that have washed their limbs with<br>sanctified water upon the completion of the horse-sacrifice, repair to<br>such regions. Verily, Dhritarashtra shall not go there!'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'Next to those, blaze in beauty those eternal regions,<br>redolent with delicious perfumes, free from passion, and transcending all<br>sorrow. Those are the regions of kine difficult of attainment where<br>oppression can never be. If thou repairest thither, I shall proceed even<br>thither and force thee to yield up this elephant to me!'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'He who, owning thousand kine, gives away a hundred<br>kine every year, or owning a hundred kine gives away ten every year to<br>the best of his might, or owning only ten or even five kine gives away<br>therefrom one cow, and they who attain to a mature old age practising the<br>vows of Brahmacharya all their days, who obey the declarations of the<br>Vedas, and who, endued with energy of mind, betake themselves to<br>pilgrimages to sacred waters and shrines, dwell in felicity in the region<br>of kine. They who repair to Prabhasa and Manasa, the lakes of Pushkara,<br>the large lake called Mahatsara, the sacred woods of Naimisha, Vahuda,<br>Karatoya, Ganga, Gayasiras, Vipasa, Sthulavaluka, Krishna, the five<br>rivers (of the Punjab), the extensive lake called Mahahrada, Gomati,<br>Kausiki, Champa, Saraswati, Drisadwati, and Yamuna,&#8212;indeed, those<br>illustrious Brahmanas, steady in the observance of vows, who go to these<br>sacred waters,&#8212;repair to the regions of which thou speakest. Endued with<br>celestial bodies and adorned with celestial garlands those blessed<br>individuals, always emitting the most delightful perfumes, repair to<br>those regions of joy and gladness. Verily, Dhritarashtra shall not go<br>there!'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'Next to these are regions where there is no fear of the<br>least cold or heat, no hunger, no thirst, no pain, no sorrow, no joy, no<br>one that is agreeable or disagreeable, on friend, and on enemy: where<br>decrepitude and death are not, and where there is neither righteousness<br>nor sin. Proceeding even to that region which is freed from passion,<br>which abounds with equable happiness, and where there is wisdom and the:<br>tribute of Sattwa,&#8212;verily, proceeding to even that sacred abode of the<br>self-born Brahman,&#8212;I shall force thee to yield up this elephant to me!'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'They who are freed from all attachments, who are<br>possessed of cleansed souls, who are steady in the observance of the<br>foremost vows, who are devoted to the Yoga that depends on tranquillising<br>the mind, and who have (in this life) attained to the happiness of<br>heaven,&#8212;those persons wedded to the attribute of Sattwa&#8212;attain to the<br>sacred region of Brahman. O great ascetic, thou shalt not be able to<br>discover Dhritarashtra there!'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'There where the foremost of Rathantaras is sung, where<br>altars are strewn with the sacred Kusa blades, for the performance of<br>Pundarika sacrifices, there where Soma-drinking Brahmanas go on vehicles<br>drawn by excellent steeds,[453] proceeding even thither I shall force<br>thee to yield up this elephant. I think, thou art the slayer of Vritra,<br>viz., the deity that has performed a hundred sacrifices, engaged in<br>roving through all the regions of the universe! I hope, I have not,<br>through mental weakness (not recognising thee before) committed any fault<br>by the words I have addressed thee!'<br><br>"The deity of a hundred sacrifices said, 'Yes, I am Maghavat. I came to<br>the world of human beings, for seizing this elephant. I bow to thee. Do<br>thou command me! I shall readily accomplish all that thou mayst be<br>pleased to say!'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'Do thou give me, O chief of the deities, this elephant<br>that is of white complexion and that is so young, for it is only ten<br>years of age. I have brought it up as a child of my own. Dwelling in<br>these woods, it has grown under my eye and has been to me a dear<br>companion. Do thou set free this my child that thou hast seized and<br>wishest to drag away!'<br><br>"The deity of a hundred sacrifices said, 'This elephant that has been a<br>son to thee, O foremost of Brahmanas, cometh to thee looking wishfully at<br>thee! Behold, it sniffs thy feet with its nostrils! My salutations to<br>thee! Do thou pray for my welfare!'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'O chief of the deities, I do always think of thy good! I<br>always offer thee worship! Do thou also, O Sakra, bestow thy blessings on<br>me! Given by thee, I accept this elephant!'<br><br>"The deity of a hundred sacrifices said, 'Amongst all those high-souled<br>and foremost of Rishis that firmly adhere to truth and that have the<br>Vedas planted in their heart, thou alone hast been able to recognise me.<br>For this reason I am exceedingly pleased with thee! Do thou, therefore, O<br>Brahmana, come with me quickly, accompanied by this thy son! Thou<br>deservest to attain to diverse regions of great felicity without the<br>delay of even a single day!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Having said these words, the wielder of the<br>thunderbolt, taking Gautama with him and placing him before, along with<br>his son, viz., that elephant, proceeded to heaven, that is difficult of<br>attainment by even the righteous. He who would listen to this history<br>every day or would recite it, restraining his senses the while,<br>proceedeth (after death) to the region of Brahman even as Gautama<br>himself.'"
