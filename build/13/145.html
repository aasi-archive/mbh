                            "Uma said, 'By what disposition, what conduct, what acts, and what gifts,<br>does a man succeed in attaining to Heaven?'<br><br>"Maheswara said, 'He who is endued with a liberal disposition, who<br>honours Brahmanas and treats them with hospitality, who makes gifts of<br>food and drink and robes and other articles of enjoyment unto the<br>destitute, the blind, and the distressed, who makes gifts of houses,<br>erects halls (for use of the public), digs wells, constructs shelters<br>whence pure and cool water is distributed (during the hot months unto<br>thirsty travellers), excavates tanks, makes arrangements for the free<br>distribution of gifts every day, gives to all seekers what each solicits,<br>who makes gifts of seats and beds and conveyances, wealth, jewels and<br>gems, houses, all kinds of corn, kine, fields, and women,&#8212;verily, he who<br>always makes these gifts with a cheerful heart, becomes a denizen, O<br>goddess, of Heaven. He resides there for a long period, enjoying diverse<br>kinds of superior articles. Passing his time happily in the company of<br>the Apsaras, he sports in the woods of Nandana and other delightful<br>regions. After the exhaustion of his merits he falls down from Heaven and<br>takes birth in the order of humanity, in a family, O goddess, that is<br>possessed of wealth in abundance and that has a large command of every<br>article of enjoyments. In that life he becomes endued with all articles<br>for gratifying his wishes and appetites. Indeed, blessed with the<br>possession of such articles, he becomes endued with affluence and a<br>well-filled treasury. The self-born Brahman himself declared it in days<br>of old that it is even such persons, O goddess, that become highly<br>blessed and possessed of liberal dispositions and agreeable features.<br>There are others, O goddess, that are incapable of making gifts. Endued<br>with small understandings, they cannot make gifts even when solicited by<br>Brahmanas and possessed of abundant wealth. Beholding the destitute, the<br>blind, the distressed, and mendicants, and even guests arrived at their<br>abodes, those persons, always filled with the desire of gratifying the<br>organ of taste, turn away, even when expressly solicited by them. They<br>never make gifts of wealth or robes, or viands, or gold, or kine, or any<br>kind of food. Those men who are disinclined to relieve the distress of<br>others, who are full of cupidity, who have no faith in the scriptures,<br>and who never make gifts,&#8212;verily, these men of little understanding, O<br>goddess, have to sink in Hell. In course of time, when their sufferings<br>in Hell come to an end, they take birth in the order of humanity, in<br>families that are entirely destitute of wealth. Always suffering from<br>hunger and thirst, excluded from all decent society, hopeless of ever<br>enjoying good things, they lead lives of great wretchedness. Born in<br>families that are destitute of all articles of enjoyment, these men never<br>succeed in enjoying the good things of the world. Indeed, O goddess, it<br>is through their acts that persons become wretched and poor. There are<br>others who are full of arrogance and pride caused by the possession of<br>riches. Those senseless wretches never offer seats to those that deserve<br>such an offer. Endued with little understandings they do not give way to<br>them that deserve such an honour.[575] Nor do they give water for washing<br>the feet to persons unto whom it should be given. Indeed, they do not<br>honour, agreeably to the ordinance, with gifts of the Arghya, such<br>persons as deserve to be honoured therewith. They do not offer water for<br>washing the mouth unto such as deserve to have that honour. They do not<br>treat their very preceptors, when the latter arrive at their houses, in<br>the manner in which preceptors should be treated. Living in cupidity and<br>arrogance, they refuse to treat their seniors and aged men with love and<br>affection, even insulting those that deserve to be honoured and asserting<br>their superiority over them without showing reverence and humility. Such<br>men, O goddess, sink in Hell. When their sufferings come to an end after<br>a long course of years, they rise from Hell, and take birth in the order<br>of humanity, in low and wretched families. Indeed. they who humiliate<br>their preceptors and seniors, have to take their birth in such castes as<br>those of Swapakas and Pukkasas who are exceedingly vile and bereft of<br>intelligence. He who is not arrogant or filled with pride, who is a<br>worshipper of the deities and Brahmanas, who enjoys the respect of the<br>world, who bows to every one that deserves his reverence, who utters<br>smooth and sweet words, who benefits persons of all orders, who is always<br>devoted to the good of all beings, who does not feel aversion for<br>anybody, who is sweet-tongued, who is an utterer of agreeable and cooling<br>words, who gives way to one that deserves to have way, who adores his<br>preceptors in the manner in which preceptors deserve to be adored, who<br>welcomes all creatures with proper courtesy, who does not hear ill will<br>towards any creature, who lives, worshipping seniors and guests with such<br>honours as they deserve, who is ever bent upon securing as many guests as<br>possible, and who worships all who honour his house with their presence,<br>succeeds, O goddess, in ascending to Heaven. Upon the exhaustion of his<br>merit, he takes birth in the order of humanity in a high and respectable<br>family. In that life he becomes possessed of all articles of enjoyment in<br>abundance and jewels and gems and every kind of wealth in profusion. He<br>gives unto deserving persons what they deserve. He becomes devoted to the<br>observance of every duty and every act of righteousness. Honoured by all<br>creatures and receiving their reverence, he obtains the fruits of his own<br>acts. Even such a person acquires a high lineage and birth in this world.<br>This that I have recited to thee was said by the Ordainer (Brahman)<br>himself in days of old. That man who is fierce in conduct, who inspires<br>terror in all creatures, who injures other beings with hands or feet or<br>cords or sticks, or brick-bats or clods of hard clay, or other means of<br>wounding and paining, O beautiful lady, who practises diverse kinds of<br>deceit for slaying living creatures or vexing them, who pursues animals<br>in the chase and causes them to tremble in fear,&#8212;verily, that man, who<br>conducts himself in this way, is certain to sink in Hell. If in course of<br>time he takes birth in the order of humanity, he is obliged to be born in<br>a low and wretched race or family that is afflicted with impediments of<br>every kind on every side. He becomes an object of aversion to all the<br>world. Wretched among men, he becomes so through the consequence of his<br>own acts. Another, who is possessed of compassion, casts his eye on all<br>creatures. Endued with a friendly vision, behaving towards all creatures<br>as if he were their father, divested of every hostile feeling, with all<br>his passions under complete control, he never vexes any creature and<br>never inspires them with fear by means of his hands or feet which are<br>always under his control. He inspires the confidence of all beings. He<br>never afflicts any creature with either cords or clubs or brick-bats or<br>clods of hard earth or weapons of any kind. His deeds are never fierce or<br>cruel, and he is full of kindness. One who is endued with such practices<br>and conduct certainly ascend to Heaven. There he lives like a god in a<br>celestial mansion abounding with every comfort. If, upon the exhaustion<br>of his merit, he has to take birth in the order of humanity, he becomes<br>born as a man that has not to fight with difficulties of any kind or to<br>encounter any fear. Indeed, he enjoys great happiness. Possessed of<br>felicity, without the obligation of undergoing distressing labour for his<br>subsistence, he lives freed from every kind of anxiety. Even this, O<br>goddess, is the path of the righteous. In it there are no impediments or<br>afflictions.'<br><br>"Uma said, 'In the world some men are seen well-versed in inferences and<br>the premises leading to them. Indeed, they are possessed of science and<br>knowledge, have large progeny, and are endued with learning and wisdom.<br>Others, O god, are destitute of wisdom, science, and knowledge, and are<br>characterised by folly. By what particular acts does a person become<br>possessed of wisdom? By what acts, again, does one become possessed of<br>little wisdom and distorted vision? Do thou dispel this doubt of mine, O<br>thou that art the foremost of all beings conversant with duties. Others<br>there are, O god, that are blind from the moment of their birth. Others<br>there are that are diseased and afflicted and impotent. Do thou, O god,<br>tell me the reason of this.'<br><br>"Maheswara said, 'Those men that always enquire, about what is for their<br>benefit and what is to their detriment, Brahmanas learned in the Vedas,<br>crowned with success, and conversant with all duties, that avoid all<br>kinds of evil deeds and achieve only such deeds as are good, succeed in<br>ascending to Heaven after departing from this world and enjoy great<br>happiness as long as they live here. Indeed, upon the exhaustion of their<br>merit when they take birth in the order of humanity, they become born as<br>men possessed of great intelligence. Every kind of felicity and<br>auspiciousness becomes theirs in consequence of that intelligence with<br>which they are born. Those men of foolish understandings who cast wicked<br>eyes upon the wedded spouses of other men, become cursed with congenital<br>blindness in consequence of that sinfulness of theirs. Those men who,<br>impelled by desire in their hearts, cast their eyes on naked women, those<br>men of wicked deeds take birth in this world to pass their whole lives in<br>one continuous disease. Those men of foolish and wicked deeds who indulge<br>in sexual congress with women of orders different from their own,&#8212;those<br>men of little wisdom,&#8212;have to take birth in their next lives as persons<br>destitute of virility. Those men who cause animals to be slain, and those<br>who violate the beds of their preceptors, and those who indulge<br>promiscuously in sexual congress, have to take birth in their next lives<br>as persons destitute of the virile power.'<br><br>"Uma said, 'What acts, O foremost of the deities, are faulty, and what<br>acts are faultless? What, indeed, are those acts by doing which a man<br>succeeds in attaining to what is for your highest good?'<br><br>"Maheswara said, 'That man who is desirous of ascertaining what is<br>righteousness, and who wishes to acquire prominent virtues and<br>accomplishments, and who always puts questions to the Brahmanas with a<br>view to find out the path that leads to his highest good, succeed in<br>ascending to Heaven. If (after exhaustion of his merit) he takes birth in<br>the order of humanity, he becomes endued with intelligence and memory and<br>great wisdom. This, O goddess, is the line of conduct that the righteous<br>are to follow and that is fraught with great benefit. I have told thee of<br>it for the good of human beings.'<br><br>"Uma said, 'There are men who hate righteousness and who are possessed of<br>little understanding. They never wish to approach Brahmanas conversant<br>with the Vedas. There are others who are observant of vows and who are<br>devoted to the duty of performing Sraddhas. Others, again, are destitute<br>of all vows. They are unmindful of observance and are like Rakshasas in<br>conduct. Some there are who are devoted to the performance of sacrifices<br>and some who are unmindful of the Homa. Through the consequences of what<br>acts do men become possessed of These different natures?'<br><br>"Maheswara said, 'Through the Vedas, the limits have been assigned of all<br>the acts of human beings. Those men that conduct themselves according to<br>the authority of the Vedas, are seen (in their next lives) to become<br>devoted to the observance of vows. Those men, however, who having become<br>subject to the sway of folly accept unrighteousness for its reverse,<br>become destitute of vows, transgress all restraints, and come to be<br>regarded as Brahmarakshasas. Indeed, it is these men that become<br>unmindful of the Homa, that never utter the Vashat and other sacred<br>Mantras, and that come to be regarded as the lowest and vilest of men<br>Thus, O goddess, have I explained to thee the entire ocean of duties in<br>respect of human beings for the sake of removing thy doubts, not omitting<br>the sins of which they become guilty.'"
