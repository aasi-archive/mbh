                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Which act, O grandsire, is the foremost of all those<br>that have been laid down for a king? What is that act by doing which a<br>king succeeds in enjoying both this world and the next?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Even this viz., the worship of the Brahmanas, is the<br>foremost of all those act, O Bharata, which have been laid down for a<br>king duly installed on the throne, if, indeed, he is desirous of<br>obtaining great happiness. Even this is what the foremost of all kings<br>should do. Know this well, O chief of Bharata's race. The king should<br>always worship with reverence all righteous Brahmanas possessed of Vedic<br>lore.[255] The king should, with bows and comforting speeches and gifts<br>of all articles of enjoyment, worship all Brahmanas possessed of great<br>learning who may dwell in his city or provinces. This is the foremost of<br>all acts laid down for the king. Indeed, the king should always keep his<br>eyes fixed on this. He should protect and cherish these, even as he<br>protects his own self or his own children. The king should worship with<br>greater reverence those amongst the Brahmanas that may be worthy of it<br>(for their superior sanctity and learning). When such men are freed from<br>all anxiety, the whole kingdom blazes forth in beauty. Such individuals<br>are worthy of adoration. Unto such the king should bow his head. Verily,<br>they should be honoured, even as one honours one's sires and grandsires.<br>Upon them depends the course of conduct followed by men, even as the<br>existence of all creatures depends upon Vasava. Of prowess incapable of<br>being baffled and endued with great energy, such men, if enraged, are<br>capable of consuming the entire kingdom to ashes by only fiat of their<br>will, or by acts of incantation, or by other means (derived from the<br>power of penance). I do not see anything that can destroy them. Their<br>power seems to be uncontrolled, being capable of reaching to the farthest<br>end of the universe. When angry, their glances fall upon men and things<br>like a blazing flame of fire upon a forest. The most courageous men are<br>struck with fear at their men. Their virtues and powers are extraordinary<br>and immeasurable. Some amongst them are like wells and pits with mouths<br>covered by grass and creepers, while others resemble the firmament<br>cleared of clouds and darkness. Some amongst them are of fierce<br>dispositions (like Durvasas and others of that stamp). Some are as mild<br>and soft in disposition as cotton (like Gautama and others). Some amongst<br>them are very cunning (like Agastya who devoured the Asura Vatapi, and<br>Rishis of that class). Some amongst them are devoted to the practice of<br>penances. Some amongst them are employed in agricultural pursuits (like<br>the preceptor of Uddalaka). Some amongst them are engaged in the keep of<br>kine (as Upamanyu while attending his preceptor). Some amongst them live<br>upon eleemosynary alms. Some amongst them are even thieves (like Valmiki<br>in his early years and Viswamitra during a famine). Some amongst them are<br>fond of fomenting quarrels and disputes (like Narada). Some, again,<br>amongst them are actors and dancers (like Bharata). Some amongst them are<br>competent to achieve all feats, ordinary and extraordinary (like Agastya<br>drinking up the entire ocean, as if it were a palmful of water). The<br>Brahmanas, O chief of Bharata's race are of diverse aspects and<br>behaviour. One should always utter the praises of the Brahmanas who are<br>conversant with all duties, who are righteous of behaviour, who are<br>devoted to diverse kinds of act, and who are seen to derive their<br>sustenance from diverse kinds of occupations.[256] The Brahmanas, O ruler<br>of men, who are highly blessed, are elder in respect of their origin than<br>the Pitris, the deities, human beings (belonging to the three other<br>orders), the Snakes and the Rakshasas. These regenerate persons are<br>incapable of being vanquished by the deities or the Pitris, or the<br>Gandharvas or the Rakshasas, or the Asuras or the Pisachas. The Brahmanas<br>are competent to make him a deity that is not a deity They can, again,<br>divest one that is a deity of his status as such. He becomes a king whom<br>they wish to make a king. He, on the other hand, goes to the wall whom<br>they do not love or like. I tell thee truly, O king, that those foolish<br>persons, without doubt, meet with destruction who calumniate the<br>Brahmanas and utter their dispraise. Skilled in praise and dispraise, and<br>themselves the origin or cause of other people's fame and ignominy the<br>Brahmanas, O king, always become angry with those that seek to injure<br>others. That man whom the Brahmanas praise succeeds in growing in<br>prosperity. That man who is censured and is cast off by the Brahmanas<br>soon meets with discomfiture. It is in consequence of the absence of<br>Brahmanas from among them that the Sakas, the Yavanas, the Kamvojas and<br>other Kshatriya tribes have become fallen and degraded into the status of<br>Sudras. The Dravidas, the Kalingas, the Pulandas, the Usinaras, the<br>Kolisarpas, the Mahishakas and other Kshatriyas, have, in consequence of<br>the absence of Brahmanas from among their midst, become degraded into<br>Sudras. Defeat at their hands is preferable to victory over them, O<br>foremost of victorious persons. One slaying all other living creatures in<br>the world does not incur a sin so heinous as that of slaying a single<br>Brahmana. The great Rishis have said that Brahmanicide is a heinous sin.<br>One should never utter the dispraise or calumny of the Brahmanas. Where<br>the dispraise of Brahmanas is uttered, one should sit with face hanging<br>down or leave that spot (for avoiding both the utterer and his words).<br>That man has not as yet been born in this world or will not take birth<br>here, who has been or will be able to pass his life in happiness after<br>quarrelling with the Brahmanas. One cannot seize the wind with one's<br>hands. One cannot touch the moon with one's hand. One cannot support the<br>Earth on one's arms. After the same manner, O king, one is not able to<br>vanquish the Brahmanas in this world.'"
