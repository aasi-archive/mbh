                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I have heard, O sire, of the merits of the different<br>kinds of gift upon which thou hast discoursed to me. I understand, O<br>Bharata, that the gift of food is especially laudable and superior. What<br>however, are the great merits of making gifts of drink. I desire to hear<br>of this in detail, O grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall, O chief of Bharata's race, discourse to thee<br>upon this subject. Listen to me, O thou of unbaffled prowess, as I speak<br>to thee. I shall, O sinless one, discourse unto thee of gifts beginning<br>with that of drink. The merit that a man acquires by making gifts of food<br>and drink is such that the like of it, I think, is incapable of being<br>acquired through any other gift. There is no gift, therefore, that is<br>superior to that of either food or drink. It is no food that all living<br>creatures are able to exist. For this reason, food is regarded as a very<br>superior object in all the worlds. From food the strength and energy of<br>living creatures constantly increases. Hence, the lord of all creatures<br>has himself said that the gift of food is a very superior gift. Thou hast<br>heard, O son of Kunti, what the auspicious words are of Savitri herself<br>(on the subject of the gift of food). Thou knowest for what reason those<br>words were said, what those words were, and how they were said in course<br>of the sacred Mantras, O thou of great intelligence. A man, by making a<br>gift of food, really makes a gift of life itself. There is no gift in<br>this world that is superior to the gift of life. Thou art not<br>unacquainted with this saying of Lomasa, O thou of mighty arms! The end<br>that was attained in former days by king Sivi in consequence of his<br>having granted life to the pigeon is acquired by him, O monarch, who<br>makes a gift of food unto a Brahmana. Hence, it has been heard by us that<br>they that give life attain to very superior regions of felicity in after<br>life. Food, O best of the Kurus, may or may not be superior to drink.<br>Nothing can exist without the aid of what springs from water. The very<br>lord of all the planets, viz., the illustrious Soma, has sprung from<br>water. Amrita and Sudha and Swadha and milk as also every kind of food,<br>the deciduous herbs, O monarch, and creepers (medicinal and of other<br>virtues), spring from water. From these, O king, the life-breath of all<br>living creatures flows. The deities have nectar for their food. The Nagas<br>have Sudha. The Pitris have Swadha for theirs. The animals have herbs and<br>plants for their food. The wise have said that rice, etc., constitute the<br>food of human beings. All these, O chief of men, spring from water.<br>Hence, there is nothing superior to the gift of water or drink. If a<br>person wishes to secure prosperity for himself, he should always make<br>gifts of drink. The gift of water is regarded as very praiseworthy. It<br>leads to great fame and bestows long life on the giver. The giver of<br>water, O son of Kunti, always stays over the heads of his enemies. Such a<br>person obtains the fruition of all his wishes and earns everlasting fame.<br>The giver, O chief of men, becomes cleansed of every sin and obtains<br>unending felicity hereafter as he proceeds to heaven, O thou of great<br>splendour. Mann himself has said that such a person earns regions of<br>inexhaustible bliss in the other world.'"
