                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Unto which of two Brahmanas, when both happen to be<br>equally pure in behaviour, equally possessed of learning and purity, of<br>birth and blood, but differing from each other in only this, viz., the<br>one solicits and the other does not,&#8212;I ask, O grandsire, unto which of<br>these two would a gift be more meritorious?"<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'It has been said. O son of Pritha, that a gift made unto<br>an unsoliciting person is productive of greater merit than one made to a<br>person who solicits. One possessed of contentment is certainly more<br>deserving than that person who is destitute of that virtue and is,<br>therefore, helpless amidst the storms and buffets of the world. The<br>firmness of a Kshatriya consists in the protection he gives to others.<br>The firmness of a Brahmana consists in his refusal to solicit. The<br>Brahmana possessed of steadiness and learning and contentment gladdens<br>the deities. The wise have said that an act of solicitation on the part<br>of a poor man is a great reproach. Those persons that solicit others are<br>said to annoy the world like thieves and robbers.[323] The person who<br>solicits is said to meet with death. The giver, however, is said not to<br>meet with death. The giver is said to grant life unto him who solicits.<br>By an act of gift, O Yudhishthira, the giver is said to rescue his own<br>self also. Compassion is a very high virtue. Let people make gift from<br>compassion unto those that solicit. Those, however, that do not beg, but<br>are plunged into poverty and distress should be respectfully invited to<br>receive assistance. If such Brahmanas, who must be regarded as the<br>foremost of their order, live in thy kingdom, thou shouldst regard them<br>as fire covered with ashes. Blazing with penances, they are capable of<br>consuming the whole earth. Such persons, O son of Kuru's race, though not<br>generally worshipped, should still be regarded as deserving of worship in<br>every way. Endued with knowledge and spiritual vision and penances and<br>Yoga, such persons always deserve our worship. O scorcher of foes, do<br>thou always offer worship unto such Brahmanas. One should repair of one's<br>own accord unto those foremost of Brahmanas that do not solicit anybody<br>and make unto them gifts of diverse kinds of wealth in abundance. The<br>merit that flows from properly pouring libations into the sacred fire<br>every morning and evening is won by the person who makes gifts unto a<br>Brahmana endued with learning, with the Vedas and with high and excellent<br>vows. Thou shouldst, O son of Kunti, invite those foremost of Brahmanas<br>who are cleansed by learning and the Vedas and vows, who live in<br>independence, whose Vedic studies and penances are hidden without being<br>proclaimed from the house-top, and who are observant of excellent vows,<br>and honour them with gifts of well-constructed and delightful houses<br>equipped with servitors and robes and furniture, and with all other<br>articles of pleasure and enjoyment. Conversant with all duties and<br>possessed of minute vision, those foremost of Brahmanas, O Yudhishthira,<br>may accept the gifts offered to them with devotion and respect, thinking<br>that they should not refuse and disappoint the giver. Thou shouldst<br>invite those Brahmanas whose wives wait for their return like tillers in<br>expectation of rain. Having fed them well thou shouldst make gifts of<br>additional food unto them so that upon their return home their expectant<br>wives might be able to distribute that food among their children that had<br>clamoured for food but that had been pacified with promises Brahmacharins<br>of restrained senses, O son, by eating at one's house in the forenoon,<br>cause the three sacrificial fires to be gratified with the householder at<br>whose house they eat. Let the sacrifice of gift proceed in thy house at<br>midday, O son, and do thou also give away kine and gold and robes (unto<br>thy guests after feeding them well). By conducting thyself, in this way,<br>thou art sure to gratify the chief of the celestials himself. That would<br>constitute thy third sacrifice, O Yudhishthira, in which offerings are<br>made unto the deities, the Pitris, and the Brahmanas. By such sacrifice<br>thou art sure to gratify the Viswedevas. Let compassion unto all<br>creatures, giving unto all creatures what is due unto them, restraining<br>the senses, renunciation, steadiness, and truth, constitute the final<br>bath of that sacrifice which is constituted by gift. Even this is the<br>sacrifice that is spread out for thee,&#8212;a sacrifice that is sanctified by<br>devotion and faith, and that has a large Dakshina attached to it. This<br>sacrifice which is constituted by gift is distinguished above all other<br>sacrifices, O son, let this sacrifice be always performed by thee.'"
