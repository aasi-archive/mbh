                            "Yudhishthira said, 'It behoveth, O king to tell me truly which of the<br>two viz., man or woman derives the greater pleasure from an act of union<br>with each other. Kindly resolve my doubt in this respect."<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited this old narrative of the<br>discourse between Bhangaswana and Sakra as a precedent illustrating the<br>question. In days of yore there lived a king of the name of Bhangaswana.<br>He was exceedingly righteous and was known as a royal sage. He was,<br>however, childless, O chief of man, and therefore performed a sacrifice<br>from desire of obtaining an issue. The sacrifice which that mighty<br>monarch performed was the Agnishtuta. In consequence of the fact that the<br>deity of fire is alone adored in that sacrifice, this is always disliked<br>by Indra. Yet it is the sacrifice that is desired by men when for the<br>purpose of obtaining an issue they seek to cleanse themselves of their<br>sins.[30] The highly blessed chief of the celestials, viz. Indra,<br>learning that the monarch was desirous of performing the Agnishtuta,<br>began from that moment to look for the laches of that royal sage of<br>well-restrained soul (for if he could succeed in finding some laches, he<br>could then punish his disregarder). Notwithstanding all his vigilance,<br>however, O king, Indra failed to detect any laches, on the part of the<br>high-souled monarch. Some time after, one day, the king went on a hunting<br>expedition. Saying unto himself&#8212;This, indeed, is an opportunity,&#8212;Indra<br>stupefied the monarch. The king proceeded alone on his horse, confounded<br>because of the chief of the celestials having stupefied his senses.<br>Afflicted with hunger and thirst, the king's confusion was so great that<br>he could not ascertain the points of the compass. Indeed, afflicted with<br>thirst, he began to wander hither and thither. He then beheld a lake that<br>was exceedingly beautiful and was full of transparent water. Alighting<br>from his steed, and plunging into the lake, he caused his animal to<br>drink. Tying his horse then, whose thirst had been slaked, to a tree, the<br>king plunged into the lake again for performing his ablutions. To his<br>amazement he found that he was changed, by virtue of the waters, into a<br>woman. Beholding himself thus transformed in respect of sex itself, the<br>king became overpowered with shame. With his senses and mind completely<br>agitated, he began to reflect with his whole heart in this strain:&#8212;Alas,<br>how shall I ride my steed? How shall I return to my capital? In<br>consequence of the Agnishtuta sacrifice I have got a hundred sons all<br>endued with great might, and all children of my own loins. Alas, thus<br>transformed, what shall I say unto them? What shall I say unto my<br>spouses, my relatives and well-wishers, and my subjects of the city and<br>the provinces? Rishis conversant with the truths of duty and religion and<br>other matters say that mildness and softness and liability to extreme<br>agitation are the attributes of women, and that activity, hardness, and<br>energy are the attributes of men. Alas, my manliness has disappeared. For<br>what reason has femininity come over me? In consequence of this<br>transformation of sex, how shall I succeed in mounting my horse<br>again?&#8212;Having indulged in these sad thoughts, the monarch, with great<br>exertion, mounted his steed and came back to his capital, transformed<br>though he had been into a woman. His sons and spouses and servants, and<br>his subjects of the city and the provinces, beholding that extraordinary<br>transformation, became exceedingly amazed. Then that royal sage, that<br>foremost of eloquent men, addressing them all, said,&#8212;I had gone out on a<br>hunting expedition, accompanied by a large force. Losing all knowledge of<br>the points of the compass, I entered a thick and terrible forest,<br>impelled by the fates. In that terrible forest, I became afflicted with<br>thirst and lost my senses. I then beheld a beautiful lake abounding with<br>fowl of every description. Plunging into that stream for performing my<br>ablutions, I was transformed into a woman!&#8212;Summoning then his spouses<br>and counsellors, and all his sons by their names, that best of monarchs<br>transformed into a woman said unto them these words:&#8212;Do ye enjoy this<br>kingdom in happiness. As regards myself, I shall repair to the woods, ye<br>sons.&#8212;Having said so unto his children, the monarch proceeded to the<br>forest. Arrived there, she came upon an asylum inhabited by an ascetic.<br>By that ascetic the transformed monarch gave birth to a century of sons.<br>Taking all those children of hers, she repaired to where her former<br>children were, and addressing the latter, said,&#8212;Ye are the children of<br>my loins while I was a man. These are my children brought forth by me in<br>this state of transformation. Ye sons, do ye all enjoy my kingdom<br>together, like brothers born of the same parents.&#8212;At this command of<br>their parent, all the brothers, uniting together, began to enjoy the<br>kingdom as their joint property. Beholding those children of the king all<br>jointly enjoying the kingdom as brothers born of the same parents, the<br>chief of the celestials, filled with wrath, began to reflect&#8212;By<br>transforming this royal sage into a woman I have, it seems, done him good<br>instead of an injury. Saying this, the chief of the celestials viz.,<br>Indra of a hundred sacrifices, assuming the form of a Brahmana, repaired<br>to the capital of the king and meeting all the children succeeded in<br>disuniting the princes. He said unto them&#8212;Brothers never remain at peace<br>even when they happen to be the children of the same father. The sons of<br>the sage Kasyapa, viz., the deities and the Asuras, quarrelled with each<br>other on account of the sovereignty of the three worlds. As regards ye<br>princes, ye are the children of the royal sage Bhangaswana. These others<br>are the children of an ascetic. The deities and the Asuras are children<br>of even one common sire, and yet the latter quarrelled with each other.<br>How much more, therefore, should you quarrel with each other? This<br>kingdom that is your paternal property is being enjoyed by these children<br>of an ascetic. With these words, Indra succeeded in causing a breach<br>between them, so that they were very soon engaged in battle and slew each<br>other. Hearing this, king Bhangaswana, who was living as an ascetic<br>woman, burnt with grief and poured forth her lamentations. The lord of<br>the celestials viz. Indra, assuming the guise of a Brahmana, came to that<br>spot where the ascetic lady was living and meeting her, said,&#8212;O thou<br>that art possessed of a beautiful face, with what grief dost thou burn so<br>that thou art pouring forth thy lamentations?&#8212;Beholding the Brahmana the<br>lady told him in a piteous voice,&#8212;Two hundred sons of mine O regenerate<br>one, have been slain by Time. I was formerly a king, O learned Brahmana<br>and in that state had a hundred sons. These were begotten by me after my<br>own form, O best of regenerate persons. On one occasion I went on a<br>hunting expedition. Stupefied, I wandered amidst a thick forest.<br>Beholding at last a lake, I plunged into it. Rising, O foremost of<br>Brahmanas, I found that I had become a woman. Returning to my capital I<br>installed my sons in the sovereignty of my dominions and then departed<br>for the forest. Transformed into a woman, I bore a hundred sons to my<br>husband who is a high souled ascetic. All of them were born in the<br>ascetic's retreat. I took them to the capital. My children, through the<br>influence of Time, quarrelled with each other, O twice-born one. Thus<br>afflicted by Destiny, I am indulging in grief. Indra addressed him in<br>these harsh words.&#8212;In former days, O lady, thou gayest me great pain,<br>for thou didst perform a sacrifice that is disliked by Indra. Indeed,<br>though I was present, thou didst not invoke me with honours. I am that<br>Indra, O thou of wicked understanding. It is I with whom thou hast<br>purposely sought hostilities. Beholding Indra, the royal sage fell at his<br>feet, touching them with his head, and said,&#8212;Be gratified with me, O<br>foremost of deities. The sacrifice of which thou speakest was performed<br>from desire of offspring (and not from any wish to hurt thee). It<br>behoveth thee therefore, to grant me thy pardon.&#8212;Indra, seeing the<br>transformed monarch prostrate himself thus unto him, became gratified<br>with him and desired to give him a boon. Which of your sons, O king, dost<br>thou wish, should revive, those that were brought forth by thee<br>transformed into a woman, or those that were begotten by thee in thy<br>condition as a person of the male sex? The ascetic lady, joining her<br>hands, answered Indra, saying, O Vasava, let those sons of mine come to<br>life that were borne by me as a woman. Filled with wonder at this reply,<br>Indra once more asked the lady, Why dost thou entertain less affection<br>for those children of thine that were begotten by thee in thy form of a<br>person of the male sex? Why is it that thou bearest greater affection for<br>those children that were borne by thee in thy transformed state? I wish<br>to hear the reason of this difference in respect of thy affection. It<br>behoveth thee to tell me everything.'<br><br>"The lady said, 'The affection that is entertained by a woman is much<br>greater than that which is entertained by a man. Hence, it is, O Sakra,<br>that I wish those children to come back to life that were borne by me as<br>a woman.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed, Indra became highly pleased and said<br>unto her, O lady that art so truthful, let all thy children come back<br>into life. Do thou take another boon, O foremost of kings, in fact,<br>whatever boon thou likest. O thou of excellent vows, do thou take from me<br>whatever status thou choosest, that of woman or of man.'<br><br>"The lady said, 'I desire to remain a woman, O Sakra. In fact,&#8212;do not<br>wish to be restored to the status of manhood, O Vasava.&#8212;Hearing this<br>answer, Indra once more asked her, saying,&#8212;Why is it, O puissant one,<br>that abandoning the status of manhood thou wishest that of womanhood?<br>Questioned thus, that foremost of monarchs transformed into a woman<br>answered, 'In acts of congress, the pleasure that women enjoy is always<br>much greater than what is enjoyed by men. It is for this reason, O Sakra,<br>that I desire to continue a woman; O foremost of the deities, truly do I<br>say unto thee that I derive greater pleasure in my present status of<br>womanhood. I am quite content with this status of womanhood that I now<br>have. Do thou leave me now, O lord of heaven.&#8212;Hearing these words of<br>hers, the lord of the celestials answered,&#8212;So be it,&#8212;and bidding her<br>farewell, proceeded to heaven. Thus, O monarch, it is known that woman<br>derives much greater pleasure than man under the circumstances thou hast<br>asked.'"
