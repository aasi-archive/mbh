                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, thou art possessed of great wisdom.<br>Indeed, thou art fully conversant with every branch of learning. In our<br>great race thou art the only individual that swellest with all the<br>sciences. I desire to hear from thee discourses that are interwoven with<br>Religion and Profit, that lead to felicity hereafter, and that are<br>fraught with wonder unto all creatures. The time that has come is fraught<br>with great distress. The like of it does not generally come to kinsmen<br>and friends. Indeed, save thee, O foremost of men, we have now none else<br>that can take the place of an instructor. If, O sinless one, I with my<br>brothers deserve the favour, it behoveth thee to answer the question I<br>desire to ask thee. This one is Narayana who is endued with every<br>prosperity and is honoured by all the kings. Even he waits upon thee,<br>showing thee every indulgence and honouring thee greatly. It behoveth<br>thee to discourse unto me, through affection, for my benefit as also for<br>that of my brothers, in the presence of Vasudeva himself and of all these<br>kings.'"<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of king Yudhishthira,<br>Bhishma, the son of the river called after Bhagiratha, filled with joy in<br>consequence of his affection for the monarch and his brothers, said what<br>follows.'[559]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall certainly recite to thee discourses that are<br>delightful, on the subject, O king, of the puissance of this Vishnu as<br>displayed in days of yore and as I have heard (from my preceptors).<br>Listen to me also as I describe the puissance of that great god who has a<br>bull for his device. Listen to me as I narrate also the doubt that filled<br>the mind of the spouse of Rudra and that of Rudra himself. Once on a time<br>the righteous souled Krishna observed a vow extending for ten and two<br>years. For beholding him who had gone through the rite of initiation for<br>the observance of his great vow, there came to that place Narada and<br>Parvata, and the Island-born Krishna, and Dhaumya, that foremost of<br>silent reciters, and Devala, and Kasyapa, and Hastikasyapa. Other Rishis<br>also, endued with Diksha and self-restraint, followed by their disciples<br>and accompanied by many Siddhas and many ascetics of great merit, came<br>there. The son of Devaki offered them such honours of hospitality as are<br>deserving of the highest praise and as are offered unto the gods alone.<br>Those great Rishis sat themselves down upon seats some of which were<br>green and some endued with the colour of gold and some that were fraught<br>with the plumes of the peacock and some that were perfectly new and<br>fresh. Thus seated, they began to converse sweetly with one another on<br>subjects connected with Religion and duty as also with many royal sages<br>and deities. At that time the energy, in the form of fire, Narayana,<br>rising from the fuel that consisted of the rigid observance of his vow,<br>issued out of the mouth of Krishna of wonderful feats. That fire began to<br>consume those mountains with their trees and creepers and little plants,<br>as also with their birds and deer and beasts of prey and reptiles. Soon<br>the summit of that mountain presented a distressing and pitiful<br>appearance, Inhabited by animals of diverse kinds which began to utter<br>cries of woe and pain, the summit soon became bereft of every living<br>creature. That fire of mighty flames, having consumed everything without<br>leaving a remnant at last came back to Vishnu and touched his feet like a<br>docile disciple. That crusher of foes, viz., Krishna, beholding that<br>mountain burnt, cast a benignant look upon it and thereby brought it back<br>to its former condition. That mountain thereupon once more became adorned<br>with flowering trees and creepers, and once more echoed with the notes<br>and cries of birds and deer and animals of prey and reptiles. Seeing that<br>wonderful and inconceivable sight, all the ascetics became amazed. Their<br>hairs stood on end and their vision was blurred with tears. That foremost<br>of speakers, Narayana, beholding those Rishis thus filled with wonder,<br>addressed them in these sweet and refreshing words, 'Why, indeed, has<br>wonder filled the hearts of this assemblage of Rishis, these ascetics<br>that are always free from attachment of every kind, that are divested of<br>the idea of meum, and that are fully conversant with every sacred<br>science? It behoveth these Rishis possessed of wealth of penances and<br>freed from every stain to explain to me truly this doubt that has arisen<br>in my mind.'"<br><br>"The Rishis said, 'It is thou that createst all the worlds, and it is<br>thou that destroyest them again. It is thou that art Winter, it is thou<br>that art Summer, and it is thou that art the season of rains. Of all the<br>creatures, mobile and immobile, that are found on the earth, thou art the<br>father, thou art the mother, thou art the master, and thou art the<br>origin! Even this, O slayer of Madhu, is a matter of wonder and doubt<br>with us. O source of all auspiciousness, it behoveth Thee to resolve to<br>us that doubt, viz., the issue of fire from Thy mouth. Our fears being<br>dispelled we shall then, O Hari, recite to thee what we have heard and<br>seen.'"<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'The fire that issued from my mouth and that resembles<br>the all-consuming Yuga-fire in splendour, and by which this mountain has<br>been crushed and scorched, is nothing else than the energy of Vishnu. Ye<br>Rishis, ye are persons that have subjugated wrath, that have brought your<br>senses under complete control, that are endued with wealth of penances,<br>and that are very gods in puissance. Yet ye have suffered yourselves to<br>be agitated and distressed! I am now engaged wholly with the observances<br>relating to rigid vow. Verily, in consequence of my observing the vows of<br>an ascetic, a fire issued from my mouth. It behoves you not to suffer<br>yourselves to be agitated. It is for observing a rigid vow that I came to<br>this delightful and auspicious mountain. The object that has brought me<br>here is to acquire by the aid of penances a son that would be my equal in<br>energy. In consequence of my penances, the Soul existing in my body<br>became transformed into fire and issued out of my mouth. That fire had<br>repaired to behold the boon-giving Grandsire of all the universe. The<br>Grandsire, ye foremost of ascetics, told my soul that half the energy of<br>the great god having the bull for his device would take birth as my son.<br>That fire returning from its mission, has come back to me and approached<br>my feet like a disciple desirous of serving me dutifully. Indeed, casting<br>off its fury it has come back to me to its own proper nature. I have thus<br>told you, in brief, a mystery appertaining to Him who has the lotus for<br>his origin and who is endued with great intelligence. Ye Rishis possessed<br>of wealth of penances, ye should not give way to fear! Ye are endued with<br>far-reaching vision. Ye can proceed to every place without any<br>impediment. Blazing with vows observed by ascetics, ye are adorned with<br>knowledge and science. I now ask you to tell me something that is highly<br>wonderful which you have heard of or seen on earth or in heaven. I feel<br>an eager desire to taste the honey of that speech which will drop from<br>your lips, the honey that will, I am sure, be as sweet as a jet of nectar<br>itself. If I behold anything on earth or in heaven, which is highly<br>delightful and of wonderful aspect but which is unknown to all of you, ye<br>Rishis that look like so many gods, I say that that is in consequence of<br>my own Supreme Nature which is incapable of being obstructed by anything.<br>Anything wonderful whose knowledge dwelleth in me or is acquired by my<br>own inspiration ceases to appear wonderful to me. Anything, however, that<br>is recited by pious persons and that is heard from those that are good,<br>deserves to be accepted with respect and faith. Such discourses exist on<br>earth for a long time and are as durable as characters engraved on rocks.<br>I desire, therefore, to hear, at this meeting something dropping from the<br>lips of persons that are good and that cannot fail to be productive of<br>good to men.' Hearing these words of Krishna all those ascetics became<br>filled with surprise. They began to gaze at Janardana with those eyes of<br>theirs that were as beautiful and large as the petals of the lotus. Some<br>of them began to glorify him and some began to worship him with<br>reverence. Indeed, all of them then hymned the praises of the slayer of<br>Madhu with words whose meanings were adorned with the eternal Riks. All<br>those ascetics then appointed Narada, that foremost of all persons<br>conversant with speech, to gratify the request of Vasudeva.'<br><br>"The ascetics said, 'It behoveth thee, O Narada, to describe, in full,<br>from the beginning, unto Hrishikesa, that wonderful and inconceivable<br>incident which occurred, O puissant one, on the mountains of Himavat and<br>which, O ascetic, was witnessed by those of us that had proceeded thither<br>in course of our pilgrimage to the sacred waters. Verily, for the benefit<br>of all the Rishis here assembled, it behoveth thee to recite that<br>incident.' Thus addressed by those ascetics, the celestial Rishi, viz.,<br>the divine Narada, then recited the following story whose incidents had<br>occurred some time before.'"
