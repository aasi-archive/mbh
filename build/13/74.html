                            "Indra said, 'I wish to know, O Grandsire, what the end is that is<br>attained by him who consciously steals a cow or who sells one from<br>motives of cupidity."<br><br>"The Grandsire said, 'Hear what the consequences are that overtake those<br>persons that steal a cow for killing her for food or selling her for<br>wealth, or making a gift of her unto a Brahmana. He, who, without being<br>checked by the restraints of the scriptures, sells a cow, or kills one,<br>or eats the flesh of a cow, or they, who, for the sake of wealth, suffer<br>a person to kill kine,&#8212;all these, viz., he that kills, he that eats, and<br>he that permits the slaughter,&#8212;rot in hell for as many years as there<br>are hairs on the body of the cow so slain.[364] O thou of great<br>puissance, those faults and those kinds of faults that have been said to<br>attach to one that obstructs a Brahmana's sacrifice, are said to attach<br>to the sale and the theft of kine. That man, who, having stolen a cow<br>makes a gift of her unto a Brahmana, enjoys felicity in heaven as the<br>reward of the gift but suffers misery in hell for the sin of theft for as<br>long a period. Gold has been said to constitute the Dakshina, O thou of<br>great splendour, in gifts of kine. Indeed, gold has been said to be the<br>best Dakshina in all sacrifices. By making a gift of kine one is said to<br>rescue one's ancestors to the seventh degree as also one's descendants to<br>the seventh degree. By giving away kine with Dakshina of gold one rescues<br>one's ancestors and descendants of double the number. The gift of gold is<br>the best of gifts. Gold is, again, the best Dakshina. Gold is a great<br>cleanser, O Sakra, and is, indeed, the best of all cleansing objects. O<br>thou of a hundred sacrifices, gold has been said to be the sanctifier of<br>the entire race of him who gives it away. I have thus, O thou of great<br>splendour, told thee in brief of Dakshina.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Even this was said by the Grandsire unto Indra, O chief<br>of Bharata's race! Indra imparted it unto Dasaratha, and Dasaratha in his<br>turn unto his son Rama, Rama of Raghu's race imparted it unto his dear<br>brother Lakshmana of great fame. While dwelling in the woods, Lakshmana<br>imparted it unto the Rishis. It has then come down from generation to<br>generation, for the Rishis of rigid vows held it amongst themselves as<br>also the righteous kings of the earth. My preceptor, O Yudhishthira,<br>communicated it to me. That Brahmana, who recites it every day in the<br>assemblies of Brahmanas, in sacrifices or at gifts of kine, or when two<br>persons meet together, obtains hereafter many regions of inexhaustible<br>felicity where he always resides with the deities as his companions. The<br>holy Brahman, the Supreme Lord, had said so (unto Indra on the subject of<br>kine).'"
