                            "Uma said, 'O holy one, O thou that didst tear off the eyes of Bhaga and<br>the teeth of Pushan, O destroyer of the sacrifice of Daksha, O three-eyed<br>deity, I have a great doubt. In days of yore, the Self-born One created<br>the four orders. Through the evil consequence of what acts cloth a Vaisya<br>become a Sudra? Through what acts doth a Kshatriya become a Vaisya and a<br>regenerate person (Brahmana) becomes a Kshatriya? By what means may such<br>degradation of castes be prevented? Through what acts does a Brahmana<br>take birth in his next life, in the Sudra order? Through what acts, O<br>puissant deity, does a Kshatriya also descend to the status of Sudra? O<br>sinless one, O lord of all created beings, do thou, O illustrious one,<br>dispel this doubt of mine. How, again, can the three other orders<br>naturally succeed in attaining to the status of Brahmanhood?'<br><br>"The illustrious one said, 'The status of a Brahmana, O goddess, is<br>exceedingly difficult to attain. O auspicious lady, one becomes a<br>Brahmana through original creation or birth. After the same manner the<br>Kshatriya, the Vaisya, and the Sudra, all become so through original<br>creation. Even this is my opinion[569]. He, however, that is born a<br>Brahmana falls away from his status through his own evil acts. Hence, the<br>Brahmana, after having attained to the status of the first order, should<br>always protect it (by his acts). If one, who is a Kshatriya or Vaisya,<br>lives in the practice of those duties that are assigned to the Brahmana,<br>after the manner of a Brahmana he becomes (in his next life) a Brahmana.<br>That Brahmana who casts off the duties of his order for following those<br>assigned for the Kshatriya, is regarded as one that has fallen away from<br>the status of a Brahmana and that has become a Kshatriya. That Brahmana<br>of little understanding, who, impelled by cupidity and folly, follows the<br>practices assigned to Vaisyas forgetful of his status as a Brahmana that<br>is exceedingly difficult to attain, comes to be regarded as one that has<br>become a Vaisya. Similarly, one that is a Vaisya by birth may, by<br>following the practices of a Sudra, become a Sudra. Indeed, a Brahmana,<br>falling away from the duties of his own order, may descend to the status<br>of even a Sudra, Such a Brahmana, falling away from the order of his<br>birth and turned out of it, without attaining to the region of Brahmana<br>(which is his goal if he duly observes his own duties), sinks into Hell<br>and in his next birth becomes born as a Sudra. A highly blessed Kshatriya<br>or a Vaisya, that abandons those practices of his that are consistent<br>with the duties laid down for his order, and follows the practices laid<br>down for the Sudra, falls away from his own order and becomes a person of<br>mixed caste. It is in this way that a Brahmana. or a Kshatriya, or a<br>Vaisya, sinks into the status of a Sudra. That man who has attained to<br>clearness of vision through practice of the duties of his own order, who<br>is endued with knowledge and science, who is pure (in body and mind), who<br>is conversant with every duty and devoted to the practice of all his<br>duties, is sure to enjoy the rewards of righteousness. I shall now recite<br>to thee, O goddess, a saying uttered by Brahma (the Self-born) on this<br>subject. Those that are righteous and desirous of acquiring merit always<br>pursue with firmness the culture of the soul. The food that comes from<br>cruel and fierce persons is censurable. So also is the food that has been<br>cooked for serving a large number of persons. The same is said of the<br>food that is cooked in view of the first Sraddha of a deceased person. So<br>also is the food that is stained in consequence of the usual faults and<br>the food that is supplied by a Sudra. These should never be taken by a<br>Brahmana at any time[570]. The food of a Sudra, O goddess, is always<br>disapproved of by the high-souled deities. Even this, I think, is the<br>authority enunciated by the Grandsire with his own mouth. If a Brahmana,<br>who has set up the sacred fire and who performs sacrifices, were to die<br>with any portion of a Sudra's food remaining undigested in his stomach,<br>he is sure to take birth in his next life as a Sudra. In consequence of<br>those remains of a Sudra's food in his stomach, he falls away from the<br>status of a Brahmana. Such a Brahmana becomes invested with the status of<br>a Sudra. There is no doubt in this. This Brahmana in his next life<br>becomes invested with the status of that order upon whose food he<br>subsists through life or with the undigested portion of whose food in his<br>stomach he breathes his last.[571] That man who, having attained to the<br>auspicious status of a Brahmana which is so difficult to acquire,<br>disregards it and eats interdicted food, falls away from his high status.<br>That Brahmana who drinks alcohol, who becomes guilty of Brahmanicide or<br>mean in his behaviour, or a thief, or who breaks his vows, or becomes<br>impure, or unmindful of his Vedic studies, or sinful, or characterised by<br>cupidity, or guilty of cunning or cheating, or who does not observe vows,<br>or who weds a Sudra woman, or who derives his subsistence by pandering to<br>the lusts of other people or who sells the Soma plant, or who serves a<br>person of an order below his, falls away from his status of<br>Brahmanahood.[572] That Brahmana who violates the bed of his preceptor,<br>or who cherishes malice towards him, or who takes pleasure in speaking<br>ill of him, falls away from the status of Brahmanahood even if he be<br>conversant with Brahman. By these good acts, again, O goddess, when<br>performed, a Sudra becomes a Brahmana, and a Vaisya becomes a Kshatriya.<br>The Sudra should perform all the duties laid down for him, properly and<br>according to the ordinance. He should always wait, with obedience and<br>humility, upon person of the three other orders and serve them with care.<br>Always adhering to the path of righteousness, the Sudra should cheerfully<br>do all this. He should honour the deities and persons of the regenerate<br>orders. He should observe the vow of hospitality to all persons. With<br>senses kept under subjection and becoming abstemious in food, he should<br>never approach his wife except in her season. He should ever search after<br>persons that are holy and pure. As regards food, he should eat that which<br>remains after the needs of all persons have been satisfied. If, indeed,<br>the Sudra desires to be a Vaisya (in his next life), he should also<br>abstain from meat of animals not slain in sacrifices. If a Vaisya wishes<br>to be a Brahmana (in his next life), he should observe even these duties.<br>He should be truthful in speech, and free from pride or arrogance. He<br>should rise superior to all pairs of opposites (such as heat and cold,<br>joy and sorrow, etc.) He should be observant of the duties of peace and<br>tranquillity. He should adore the deities in sacrifices, attend with<br>devotion to the study and recitation of the Vedas, and become pure in<br>body and mind. He should keep his senses under subjection, honour the<br>Brahmanas, and seek the welfare of all the orders. Leading the domestic<br>mode of life and eating only twice a day at the prescribed hours he<br>should gratify his hunger with only such food as remains after the needs<br>have been satisfied of all the members of his family with dependants and<br>guests. He should be abstemious in food, and act without being impelled<br>by the desire of reward. He should be free from egotism. He should adore<br>the deities in the Agnihotra and pour libations according to the<br>ordinance. Observing the duties of hospitality towards all persons, he<br>should, as already said, eat the food that remains after serving all<br>others for whom it has been cooked. He should, according to the ordinance<br>laid down, worship the three fires. Such a Vaisya of pure conduct takes<br>birth in his next life in a high Kshatriya family.[573] If a Vaisya,<br>after having taken birth as a Kshatriya, goes through the usual<br>purificatory rites, becomes invested with the sacred thread, and betakes<br>himself to the observance of vows, he becomes, in his next life, an<br>honoured Brahmana. Indeed, after his birth as a Kshatriya, he should make<br>presents, adore the deities in great sacrifices with plentiful Dakshinas,<br>study the Vedas, and desirous of attaining to Heaven should worship the<br>three fires. He should interfere for dispelling the sorrows of the<br>distressed, and should always righteously cherish and protect those<br>subjects that own his sway. He should be truthful, and do all acts that<br>have truth in them, and seek happiness in conduct like this. He should<br>award punishments that are righteous, without laying aside the rod of<br>chastisement for good. He should induce men to do righteous deeds. Guided<br>by considerations of policy (in the matter of swaying his people), he<br>should take a sixth of the produce of the fields.[574] He should never<br>indulge in sexual pleasure, but live cheerfully and in independence,<br>well-conversant with the science of Wealth or Profit. Of righteous soul,<br>he should seek his wedded spouse only in her season. He should always<br>observe fasts, keep his soul under control, devote himself to the study<br>of the Vedas, and be pure in body and mind. He should sleep on blades of<br>Kusa grass spread out in his fire, chamber. He should pursue the<br>aggregate of Three (viz., Righteousness, Wealth, and Pleasure), and be<br>always cheerful. Unto Sudras desirous of food, he should always answer<br>that it is ready. He should never desire any thing from motives of gain<br>or pleasure. He should worship the Pitris and gods and guests. In his own<br>house he should live the life of a mendicant. He should duly adore the<br>deities in his Agnihotra, morning, noon, and evening every day, by<br>pouring libations agreeably to the ordinance. With his face turned<br>towards the foe, he should cast off his life-breath in battle fought for<br>the benefit of kine and Brahmanas. Or he may enter the triple fires<br>sanctified with Mantras and cast off his body. By pursuing this line of<br>conduct he takes birth in his next life as a Brahmana. Endued with<br>knowledge and science, purified from all dross, and fully conversant with<br>the Vedas, a pious Kshatriya, by his own acts, becomes a Brahmana. It is<br>with the aid of these acts, O goddess, that a person who has sprung from<br>a degraded order, viz., a Sudra, may become a Brahmana refined of all<br>stains and possessed of Vedic lore, One that is a Brahmana, when he<br>becomes wicked in conduct and observes no distinction in respect of food,<br>falls away from the status of Brahmanahood and becomes a Sudra. Even a<br>Sudra, O goddess, that has purified his soul by pure deeds and that has<br>subjugated all his senses, deserves to be waited upon and served with<br>reverence as a Brahmana. This has been said by the Self-born Brahmana<br>himself. When a pious nature and pious deeds are noticeable in even a<br>Sudra, he should, according to my opinion, be held superior to a person<br>of the three regenerate classes. Neither birth, nor the purificatory<br>rites, nor learning, nor offspring, can be regarded as grounds for<br>conferring upon one the regenerate status. Verily, conduct is the only<br>ground. All Brahmanas in this world are Brahmanas in consequence of<br>conduct. A Sudra, if he is established on good conduct, is regarded as<br>possessed of the status of a Brahmana. The status of Brahma, O auspicious<br>lady, is equal wherever it exists. Even this is my opinion. He, indeed,<br>is a Brahmana in whom the status of Brahma exists,&#8212;that condition which<br>is bereft of attributes and which has no stain attached to it. The<br>boon-giving Brahma, while he created all creatures, himself said that the<br>distribution of human beings into the four orders dependent on birth is<br>only for purposes of classification. The Brahmana is a great field in<br>this world,&#8212;a field equipped with feet for it moves from place to place.<br>He who plants seeds in that field, O beautiful lady, reaps the crop in<br>the next world. That Brahmana who wishes to achieve his own good should<br>always live upon the remains of the food that may be there in his house<br>after gratifying the needs of all others. He should always adhere to the<br>path of righteousness. Indeed, he should tread along the path that<br>belongs to Brahma. He should live engaged in the study of the Samhitas<br>and remaining at home he should discharge all the duties of a<br>householder. He should always be devoted to the study of the Vedas, but<br>he should never derive the means of subsistence from such study. That<br>Brahmana who always conducts himself thus, adhering to the path of<br>righteousness, worshipping his sacred fire, and engaged in the study of<br>the Vedas, comes to be regarded as Brahma. The status of a Brahmana once<br>gained, it should always be protected with care, O thou of sweet smiles,<br>by avoiding the stain of contact with persons born in inferior orders,<br>and by abstaining from the acceptance of gifts. I have thus told thee a<br>mystery, viz., the manner in which a Sudra may become a Brahmana, or that<br>by which a Brahmana falls away from his own pure status and becomes a<br>Sudra."
