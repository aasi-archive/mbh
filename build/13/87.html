                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast discoursed to me, O thou of righteous<br>soul, on the duties of the four orders. Do thou, after the same manner, Q<br>king, discourse to me now on all the ordinances respecting the Sraddha<br>(of deceased ancestors).'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Santanu set himself to declare unto him the following ritual, consistent<br>with the ordinance of the Sraddha.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O king, with close attention, to me as I<br>discourse to you on the ritual of the Sraddha. That ritual is auspicious,<br>worthy of praise, productive of fame and progeny, and is regarded as a<br>sacrifice, O scorcher of foes, in honour of the Pitris. Gods or Asuras or<br>human beings, Gandharvas or Uragas or Rakshasas, Pisachas or<br>Kinnaras,&#8212;every one should always worship the Pitris. It is seen that<br>people worship the Pitris first, and gratify the deities next by offering<br>them their adorations. Hence, one should always worship the Pitris with<br>every care.[396] It is said, O king, that the Sraddha performed in honour<br>of the Pitris is performable afterwards. But this general rule is<br>restrained by a special one (which directs that the Sraddha in honour of<br>the Pitris should be performed on the afternoon of the day of the New<br>moon).[397] The (deceased) grandsires become gratified with the Sraddha<br>that may be performed on any day. I shall, however, tell thee now what<br>the merits and demerits are of the respective lunar days (in view of<br>their adaptability to the performance of the Sraddha). I shall discourse<br>to thee, O sinless one, what fruits are attained on what days by<br>performing the Sraddha. Do thou listen to me with close attention. By<br>adoring the Pitris on the first day of the lighted fortnight, one obtains<br>in one's abode beautiful spouses capable of producing many children all<br>possessed of desirable accomplishments. By performing the Sraddha on the<br>second day of the lighted fortnight one gets many daughters. By<br>performing it on the third day, one acquires many steeds. By performing<br>it on the fourth day, one gets a large herd of smaller animals (such as<br>goats and sheep) in one's house. They, O king, who perform the Sraddha on<br>the fifth day, get many sons. Those men who perform the Sraddha on the<br>sixth day acquire great splendour. By performing it on the seventh day, O<br>monarch, one acquires great fame. By performing it on the eighth day one<br>makes great profits in trade. By performing it on the ninth day one<br>acquires many animals of uncloven hoofs. By performing it on the tenth<br>day one acquires much wealth in kine. By performing it on the eleventh<br>day one becomes the possessor of much wealth in clothes and utensils (of<br>brass and other metals). Such a man also obtains many sons all of whom<br>become endued with Brahma splendour. By performing the Sraddha on the<br>twelfth day one always beholds, if one desires, diverse kinds of<br>beautiful articles made of silver and gold. By performing the Sraddha on<br>the thirteenth day one attains to eminence over one's kinsmen. Without<br>doubt, all the young men in the family of him who performs the Sraddha on<br>the fourteenth day meet with death. Such a man becomes entangled in war,<br>By performing the Sraddha on the day of the new moon, one obtains the<br>fruition of every wish. In the dark fortnight, all the days commencing<br>with the tenth (and ending with that of the new moon), leaving only the<br>fourteenth day out, are laudable days for the performance of the Sraddha.<br>Other days of that fortnight are not so. Then, again, as the dark<br>fortnight is better than the lighted one, so the afternoon of the day is<br>better than the forenoon in the matter of the Sraddha.'"
