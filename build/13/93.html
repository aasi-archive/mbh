                            "Yudhishthira said, 'If Brahmanas that are in the observance of a vow<br>(viz., fast) eat, at the invitation of a Brahmana, the Havi (offered at a<br>Sraddha), can they be charged with the transgression or a violation of<br>their vow, or should they refuse the invitation of a Brahmana when such<br>invitation is received by them? Tell me this, O grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Let those Brahmanas eat, impelled by desire, who are<br>observant of such vows as are not indicated in the Vedas. As regards<br>those Brahmanas, however, that are observant of such vows are indicated<br>in the Vedas, they are regarded as guilty of a breach of their vow, O<br>Yudhishthira, by eating the Havi of a Sraddha at the request of him who<br>performs the Sraddha.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Some people say that fast is a penance. Is penance<br>really identifiable with fast or is it not so? Tell me this, O grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'People do regard a regular fast for a month or a half<br>month as a penance. The truth, however, is that one who mortifies one's<br>own body is not to be regarded either as an ascetic or as one conversant<br>with duty[415]. Renunciation, however, is regarded as the best of<br>penances. A Brahmana should always be an abstainer from food, and observe<br>the vow called Brahmacharya.[416] A Brahmana should always practise<br>self-denial restraining even speech, and recite the Vedas. The Brahmana<br>should marry and surround himself with children and relatives, from<br>desire of achieving righteousness. He should never sleep. He should<br>abstain from meat. He should always read the Vedas and the scriptures. He<br>should always speak the truth, and practise self-denial. He should eat<br>Vighasa (viz., what remains after serving the deities and guests).<br>Indeed, he should be hospitable towards all that come to his abode. He<br>should always eat Amrita (viz., the food that remains in the house after<br>all the family, including guests and servants have eaten) He should duly<br>observe all rites and perform sacrifices.'"<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, "How may one come to be regarded as always observant<br>of fasts? How may one become observant of vows? How, O king, may one come<br>to be an eater of Vighasa? By doing what may one be said to be found of<br>guest?'"<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'He who takes food only morning and evening at the<br>prescribed hours and abstains from all food during the interval between,<br>is said to be an abstainer from food. He who has congress with only his<br>wedded wife and that only at her season, is said to be observant of the<br>vow of Brahmacharya. By always making gifts, one comes to be regarded as<br>truthful in speech. By abstaining from all meat obtained from animals<br>slaughtered for nothing, one becomes an abstainer from meat.[417] By<br>making gifts one becomes cleansed of all sins, and by abstaining from<br>sleep during daytime one comes to be regarded as always awake. He who<br>always eats what remains after serving the needs of guests and servants<br>is said to always eat Amrita. He who abstains from eating till Brahmanas<br>have eaten (of that food), is regarded as conquering heaven by such<br>abstention. He who eats what remains after serving the deities, the<br>Pitris, and relatives and dependants, is said to eat Vighasa. Such men<br>acquire many regions of felicity in the abode of Brahman himself. There,<br>O king, they dwell in the company of Apsaras and Gandharvas. Indeed, they<br>sport and enjoy all sports of delight in those regions, with the deities<br>and guests and the Pitris in their company, and surrounded by their own<br>children and grandchildren. Even such becomes their high end.'"<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'People are seen to make diverse kinds of gifts unto<br>the Brahmanas. What, however, is the difference, O grandsire, between the<br>giver and the receiver?'"<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The Brahmana accepts gifts from him that is righteous,<br>and from him that is unrighteous. If the giver happens to be righteous,<br>the receiver incurs little fault. If on the other hand, the giver happens<br>to be unrighteous the receiver sinks in hell. In this connection is cited<br>an old history of the conversation between Vrishadarbhi and the seven<br>Rishis, O Bharata. Kasyapa and Atri and Vasishtha and Bharadwaja and<br>Gautama and Viswamitra and Jamadagni, and the chaste Arundhati (the wife<br>of Vasishtha), all had a common maidservant whose name was Ganda. A Sudra<br>of the name of Pasusakha married Ganda and became her husband. Kasyapa<br>and others, in days of old, observed the austerest penances and roved<br>over the world, desirous of attaining to the eternal region of Brahman by<br>the aid of Yoga-meditation. About that time, O delighter of the Kurus,<br>there occurred a severe drought. Afflicted by hunger, the whole world of<br>living creatures became exceedingly weak. At a sacrifice which had been<br>performed in former times by Sivi's son he had given away unto the<br>Ritwiks a son of his as the sacrificial present. About this time,<br>unendued with longevity as the prince was, he died of starvation. The<br>Rishis named, afflicted with hunger, approached the dead prince and sat<br>surrounding him. Indeed, those foremost of Rishis, beholding the son of<br>him at whose sacrifice they had officiated, O Bharata, thus dead of<br>starvation, began to cook the body in a vessel, impelled by the pangs of<br>hunger. All food having disappeared from the world of men, those<br>ascetics, desirous of saving their lives, had recourse, for purposes of<br>sustenance, to such a miserable shift. While they were thus employed.<br>Vrishadarbha's son, viz., king Saivya, in course of his roving, came upon<br>those Rishis. Indeed, he met them on his way, engaged in cooking the dead<br>body, impelled by the pangs of hunger.'"<br><br>"The son of Vrishadarbha said, 'The acceptance of a gift (from me) will<br>immediately relieve you all. Do you, therefore, accept a gift for the<br>support of your bodies! Ye ascetics endued with wealth of penances,<br>listen to me as I declare what wealth I have! That Brahmana who solicits<br>me (for gifts) is ever dear to me. Verily, I shall give unto you a<br>thousand mules. Unto each of you I shall give a thousand kine of white<br>hair, foremost in speed, each accompanied by a bull, and each having a<br>well-born calf, and, therefore, yielding milk. I shall also give unto you<br>a thousand bulls of white complexion and of the best breed and capable of<br>bearing heavy burdens. I shall also give you a large number of kine, of<br>good disposition, the foremost of their kind, all fat, and each of which,<br>having brought forth her first calf, is quick with her second.[418] Tell<br>me what else I shall give of foremost villages, of grain, of barley, and<br>of even the rarer and costly jewels. Do not seek to eat this food that is<br>inedible. Tell me what I should give unto you for the support of your<br>bodies!'<br><br>"The Rishis said, 'O king, an acceptance of gifts from a monarch is very<br>sweet at first but it is poison in the end. Knowing this well, why do<br>you, O king, tempt us then with these offers? The body of the Brahmana is<br>the field of the deities. By penance, it is purified. Then again, by<br>gratifying the Brahmana, one gratifies the deities. If a Brahmana accepts<br>the gifts made to him by the king, he loses, by such acceptance, the<br>merit that he would otherwise acquire by his penances that day. Indeed,<br>such acceptance consumes that merit even as a blazing conflagration<br>consumes a forest. Let happiness be thine, O king, as the result of the<br>gifts thou makest to those that solicit thee!' Saying these words unto<br>them, they left the spot, proceeding by another way. The flesh those<br>high-souled ones had intended to cook remained uncooked. Indeed,<br>abandoning that flesh, they went away, and entered the woods in search of<br>food. After this, the ministers of the king, urged by their master,<br>entered those woods and plucking certain figs endeavoured to give them<br>away unto those Rishis. The officers of the king filled some of those<br>figs with gold and mixing them with others sought to induce those<br>ascetics to accept them. Atri took up some of those figs, and finding<br>them heavy refused to take them. He said, 'We are not destitute of<br>knowledge. We are not fools! We know that there is gold within these<br>figs. We have our senses about us. Indeed, we are awake instead of being<br>asleep. If accepted in this world, those will produce bitter consequence<br>hereafter. He who seeks happiness both here and hereafter should never<br>accept these.'"<br><br>"Vasishtha said, 'If we accept even one gold coin, it will be counted as<br>a hundred or even a thousand (in assigning the demerit that attaches to<br>acceptance). If, therefore, we accept many coins, we shall surely attain<br>to an unhappy end hereafter!'"<br><br>Kasyapa said, 'All the paddy and barley on earth, all the gold and<br>animals and women that occur in the world, are incapable of gratifying<br>the desire of a single person. Hence, one possessed of wisdom should<br>dispelling cupidity, adopt tranquillity!'"<br><br>"Bharadwaja said, 'The horns of a Ruru, after their first appearance,<br>begin to grow with the growth of the animal. The cupidity of man is even<br>like this. It has no measure!'"<br><br>"Gautama said, 'All the objects that exist in the world are incapable of<br>gratifying even a single person. Man is even like the ocean, for he can<br>never be filled (even as the ocean can never be filled by all the waters<br>that are discharged into it by the rivers).'"<br><br>"Viswamitra said, 'When one desire cherished by a person becomes<br>gratified, there springs up immediately another whose gratification is<br>sought and which pierces him like a shaft.'"<br><br>"Jamadagni said, 'Abstention from accepting guts supports penances as<br>their foundation. Acceptance, however, destroys that wealth (viz., the<br>merit of penances).'"<br><br>"Arundhati said, 'Some people are of opinion that things of the world may<br>be stored with a view to spend them upon the acquisition of righteousness<br>(by gifts and sacrifices). I think, however, that the acquisition of<br>righteousness is better than that of worldly wealth.'"<br><br>"Ganda said, 'When these my lords, who are endued with great energy, are<br>so very much afraid of this which seems to be a great terror a weak man<br>as I am fear it the more.'"<br><br>"Pasusakha said, 'The wealth there is in righteousness is very superior.<br>There is nothing superior to it. That wealth is known to the Brahmans. I<br>wait upon them as their servant, only for learning to value that wealth.'"<br><br>"The Rishis (all together) said, 'Let happiness be his, as the result of<br>the gifts he makes, who is the king of the people of this land. Let his<br>gift be successful who has sent these fruits to us, enclosing gold within<br>them.'"<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Having said these words, those Rishis of steadfast<br>vows, abandoning the figs having gold within them, left that spot and<br>proceeded to whatever destination they liked.'"<br><br>"The ministers said, 'O king, coming to know of the existence of gold<br>within the figs, the Rishis have gone away! Let this be known to thee!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by his ministers, king Vrishadarbhi<br>became filled with wrath against all those Rishis. Indeed, to take<br>vengeance upon them, the monarch entered his own chamber. Observing the<br>austerest of penances, he poured on his sacred fire libations of ghee,<br>accompanying each with Mantras uttered by him. From that fire there then<br>arose as the result of the incantation, a form capable of striking every<br>one with fear. Vrishadarbhi named her as Yatudhani. That form which had<br>been from the incantations of the king, looking as terrible as the Last<br>Night, appeared with joined hands before the monarch. Addressing king<br>Vrishadarbhi, she said, 'What shall I accomplish?'"<br><br>"Vrishadarbhi said, 'Go and follow the seven Rishis, as also Arundhati,<br>and the husband of their maid-servant, and the maid-servant herself, and<br>comprehend what the meanings are of their names. Having ascertained their<br>names, do thou slay all of them. After slaying them thou mayst go<br>whatever destination thou likest.'"[419]<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Saying, 'So be it! the Rakshasi who had been named<br>Yatudhani, in her proper form, proceeded to that forest in which the<br>great Rishis wandered in search of food. Indeed, O king, those great<br>Rishis, with Atri among them, roved within the forest, subsisting upon<br>fruits and roots. In course of their wanderings they saw a mendicant of<br>broad shoulders, and plump arms and legs and well-nourished face and<br>abdomen. Of limbs that were all adipose, he was wandering with a dog in<br>his company. Beholding that mendicant whose limbs were all well-developed<br>and handsome, Arundhati exclaimed, addressing the Rishis, 'None of you<br>will ever be able to show such well-developed features!'"<br><br>"Vasishtha said, 'The sacred fire of this person is not like ours for<br>while he is able to pour libations on it, morning and evening, none of us<br>are able to do the same. It is for this reason that we see both him and<br>his dog so well-developed.''<br><br>"Atri said, 'This man does not, like us, feel the pangs of hunger. His<br>energy has not sustained, like ours, any diminution. Acquired with the<br>greatest difficulty, his Vedas have not, like ours, disappeared. Hence,<br>it is that we see both him and his dog so well-developed.'[420]<br><br>"Viswamitra said, 'This man is not, like us, unable to observe the<br>eternal duties inculcated in the scriptures. I have become idle. I feel<br>the pangs of hunger. I have lost the knowledge I had acquired. This man<br>is not like us in this respect. Hence I see both him and his dog so<br>well-developed.'"<br><br>''Jamadagni said, 'This man has not to think of storing his annual grain<br>and fuel as we are compelled to, do. Hence I see both him and his dog so<br>well-developed!'<br><br>"Kasyapa said, 'This man has not, like us, four brothers of the whole<br>blood who are begging from house to house, uttering the words,<br>'Give&#8212;Give!' Hence it is that I see him and his dog so well-developed.'<br><br>"Bharadwaja said, 'This man hath no regret like ours for having condemned<br>and cursed his spouse. He hath not acted so wickedly and senselessly.<br>Hence I see both him and his dog so well-developed!'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'This man bath not like us only three pieces of covering<br>made of Kusa grass, and a single Ranku-skin, each of which again, is<br>three years old. Hence it is that I see both him and his dog so<br>well-developed!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The wandering mendicant, beholding those great<br>Rishis, approach them, and accosted them all by touching their hand<br>according to the custom. Conversing then with each other about the<br>difficulty of obtaining sustenance in that forest and the consequent<br>necessity of bearing the pangs of hunger, all of them left that spot.<br>Indeed, they wandered through that wilderness, all bent upon a common<br>purpose, viz., the plucking of fruits and the extraction of roots for<br>sustenance. One day, as they were wandering they beheld a beautiful lake<br>overgrown with lotuses. Its banks were covered with trees that stood<br>thickly near one another. The waters of the lake were pure and<br>transparent. Indeed, the lotuses that adorned the lake were all of the<br>hue of the morning sun. The leaves that floated on the water were of the<br>colour of lapis lazuli. Diverse kinds of aquatic fowls were sporting on<br>its bosom. There was but one path leading to it. The banks were not miry<br>and the access to the water was easy. Urged by Vrishadarbhi, the Rakshasi<br>of frightful mien who had sprung from his incantations and who had been<br>named Yatudhani, guarded the lake. Those foremost of Rishis, with<br>Pasusakha in their company, proceeded towards the lake, which was thus<br>guarded by Yatudhani for the object of gathering some lotus stalks.[421]<br>Beholding Yatudhani, of frightful aspect standing on the banks of the<br>lake, those great Rishis addressed her, saying, 'Who art thou that thus<br>standest alone in these solitary woods? For whom dost thou wait here?<br>What, indeed, is thy purpose? What dost thou do here on the banks of this<br>lake adorned with lotuses?'"<br><br>"Yatudhani said, 'It matters not who I am. I deserve not to be questioned<br>(respecting my name and race and purposes). Ye that are possessed of<br>ascetic wealth, know that I am the guard set to watch this lake.'"<br><br>'The Rishis said, 'All of us are hungry. We have nothing else to eat.<br>With thy permission we would gather some lotus-stalks!'"<br><br>"Yatudhani said, 'Agreeably with a compact, do ye take the lotus-stalks<br>as ye please. Ye must, one by one, give me your names. Ye may then,<br>without delay, take the stalks!'"<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Ascertaining that her name was, Yatudhani and that<br>she stood there for slaying them (after knowing, from the meanings their<br>names, what the extent was of their power), Atri, who was famishing with<br>hunger, addressed her, and said these words.'"<br><br>"Atri said, 'I am called Atri because I cleanse the world from sin. For,<br>again, thrice studying the Vedas every day, I have made days of my<br>nights. That, again, is no night in which I have not studied the Vedas.<br>For these reasons also I am called Atri, O beautiful lady!'"<br><br>"Yatudhani said, 'O thou of great effulgence, the explanation thou hast<br>given me of thy name is incapable of being comprehended by me. Do thou,<br>therefore, go and plunge into this tank filled with lotuses!'"<br><br>"Vasishtha said, 'I am endued with the wealth (that consists of the Yoga<br>attributes of puissance, etc.) I lead, again, a domestic mode of life,<br>and am regarded as the foremost of all persons that lead such a mode of<br>life. In consequence of being endued with (such) wealth, of my living as<br>a householder, and of my being regarded as the foremost of all<br>householders, I am called Vasishtha.'<br><br>"Yatudhani said, 'The etymological explanation of thy name is perfectly<br>incomprehensible to me, in as much as the inflections which the original<br>roots have undergone are unintelligible. Rio and plunge into this lake of<br>lotuses!'"<br><br>"Kasyapa said, 'I always protect my body, and in consequence of my<br>penances I have become endued with effulgence. For thus protecting the<br>body and for this effulgence that is due to my penances, I have come to<br>be called by the name of Kasyapa!'<br><br>"Yatudhani said, 'O thou of great effulgence, the etymological<br>explanation thou hast given of thy name is incapable of being<br>comprehended by me. Go and plunge into this lake filled with lotuses!'<br><br>"Bharadwaja said, 'I always support my sons, my disciples, the deities,<br>the Brahmanas, and my wife. In consequence of thus supporting all with<br>ease, I am called Bharadwaja!'<br><br>"Yatudhani said, 'The etymological explanation thou hast given me of thy<br>name is perfectly incomprehensible to me, in consequence of the many<br>inflections the root has undergone. Go and plunge into this lake filled<br>with lotuses!'"<br><br>"Gotama said, 'I have conquered heaven and earth by the aid of<br>self-restraint. In consequence of my looking upon all creatures and<br>objects with an equal eye, I am like a smokeless fire. Hence I am<br>incapable of being subjugated by thee. When, again, I was born, the<br>effulgence of my body dispelled the surrounding darkness. For these<br>reasons I am called Gotama!'<br><br>"Yatudhani said, 'The explanation thou hast given me of thy name, O great<br>ascetic, is incapable of being understood by me. Go and plunge into this<br>lake of lotuses!'"<br><br>"Viswamitra said, 'The deities of the universe are my friends. I am also<br>the friend of the universe. Hence, O Yatudhani, know that I am called<br>Viswamitra!'<br><br>"Yatudhani said, 'The explanation thou hast given of thy name is<br>incomprehensible to me in consequence of the inflections the root has<br>undergone. Go and plunge into this lake of lotuses!'"<br><br>"Jamadagni said, 'I have sprung from the sacrificial fire of the deities.<br>Hence am I called Jamadagni, O thou of beautiful features!'"<br><br>"Yatudhani said, 'The etymological explanation thou hast given me, O<br>great ascetic, of thy name, is incomprehensible to me (in consequence of<br>the diverse inflections the root has undergone) Do thou go and plunge<br>into this lake of lotuses!'"<br><br>"Arundhati said, 'I always stay by the side of my husband, and hold the<br>earth jointly with him. I always incline my husband's heart towards me. I<br>am, for these reasons called Arundhati!'<br><br>"Yatudhani said, The explanation thou hast given me of thy name is<br>perfectly incomprehensible to me in consequence of the inflections the<br>roots have undergone. Go and plunge into this lake of lotuses!'<br><br>"Ganda said, 'The Ganda means a portion of the cheek. As I have that<br>portion a little elevated above the others, I am, O thou that hast sprung<br>from the sacrificial fire of Saivya, called by the name of Ganda!'"<br><br>"Yatudhani said, 'The explanation which thou hast given me of thy name is<br>perfectly incomprehensible to me in consequence of the inflections which<br>the root has undergone. Go and plunge into this lake of lotuses!'"<br><br>"Pasusakha said, 'I protect and tend all animals that I see, and I am<br>always a friend to all animals. Hence am I called Pasusakha, O thou that<br>hast sprung from the (sacrificial) fire (of king Vrishadarbhi).'<br><br>"Yatudhani said, 'The explanation thou hast given me of thy name is<br>perfectly incomprehensible to me in consequence of the inflections which<br>the roots have undergone. Go and plunge into this lake of lotuses!'"<br><br>"Sunahsakha said,[422] 'I am incapable of explaining the etymology of my<br>name after the manner of these ascetics. But know, O Yatudhani, that I am<br>called by the name of Sunahsakha!'<br><br>"Yatudhani said, 'Thou hast mentioned thy name only once. The explanation<br>thou hast offered I have not able to catch. Do thou, therefore, mention<br>it again, O regenerate one!'"<br><br>"Sunahsakha said, 'Since thou hast been unable to catch my name in<br>consequence of my having mentioned it only once, I shall strike thee with<br>my triple stick! Struck with it, be thou consumed into ashes without<br>delay!'"<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Struck then, on the head, by the Sannyasin, with his<br>triple stick which resembled the chastisement inflicted by a Brahmana,<br>the Rakshasi who had sprung from the incantations of king. Vrishadarbhi<br>fell down on the earth and became reduced to ashes.[423] Having thus<br>destroyed the mighty Rakshasi, Sunahsakha thrust his stick into the earth<br>and sat himself down on a grassy plot of land. The Rishis then, having,<br>as they liked, plucked a number of lotuses and taken up a number of<br>lotus-stalks, came up from the lake, filled with joy. Throwing on the<br>ground the heap of lotuses which they had gathered with much toil, they<br>plunged once more into it for offering oblations of water to the Pitris.<br>Coming up, they proceeded to that part of the bank where they had<br>deposited the lotus-stalks. Reaching that spot, those foremost of men<br>found that the stalks were nowhere to be seen.'"<br><br>"The Rishis said, 'What sinful and hard-hearted man has stolen away the<br>lotus-stalks gathered by our hungry selves from desire of eating?'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Those foremost of regenerate persons, suspecting one<br>another, O crusher of foes, said, 'We shall each have to swear to our<br>innocence! All those ascetics then, famishing with hunger and worn out<br>with exertion, agreeing to the proposal, took these oaths.'<br><br>"Atri said, 'Let him who has stolen the lotus-stalk touch kine with his<br>foot, make water facing the sun, and study the Vedas on excluded days!'"<br><br>"Vasishtha said, 'Let him who has stolen the lotus-stalks abstain from<br>studying the Vedas, or leash hounds, or be a wandering mendicant<br>unrestrained by the ordinances laid down for that mode of life, or be a<br>slayer of persons that seek his protection, or live upon the proceeds of<br>the sale of his daughter, or solicit wealth from those that are low and<br>vile!'"<br><br>"Kasyapa, said, 'Let him who has stolen the lotus-stalks utter all kinds<br>of words in all places, give false evidence in a court of law, eat the<br>flesh of animals not slain in sacrifices, make gifts to undeserving<br>persons or to deserving persons at unseasonable times, and have sexual<br>congress with women during daytime!'"<br><br>"Bharadwaja said, 'Let him who has stolen the lotus-stalks be cruel and<br>unrighteous in his conduct towards women and kinsmen and kine. Let him<br>humiliate Brahmanas, in disputations, by displaying his superior<br>knowledge and skill. Let him study the Riks and the Yajuses, disregarding<br>his preceptor! Let him pour libations upon fires made with dry grass or<br>straw!"[424]<br><br>"Jamadagni said, 'Let him who has stolen the lotus-stalks be guilty of<br>throwing filth and dirt on water. Let him be inspired with animosity<br>towards kine. Let him be guilty of having sexual congress with women at<br>times other than their season. Let him incur the aversion of all persons.<br>Let him derive his maintenance from the earnings of his wife! Let him<br>have no friends and let him have many foes! Let him be another's guest<br>for receiving in return those acts of hospitality which he has done to<br>that other![425]'"<br><br>"Gotama said, 'Let him who has stolen the lotus-stalks be guilty of<br>throwing away the Vedas after having studied them! Let him cast off the<br>three sacred fires! Let him be a seller of the Soma (plant or juice)! Let<br>him live with that Brahmana who resides in a village which has only one<br>well from which water is drawn by all classes and who has married a Sudra<br>woman!'"<br><br>"Viswamitra said, 'Let him who has stolen the lotus-stalks be fated to<br>see his preceptors and seniors and his servants maintained by others<br>during his own life-time. Let him not have a good end. Let him be the<br>father of many children! Let him be always impure and a wretch among<br>Brahmanas! Let him be proud of his possessions! Let him be a tiller of<br>the soil and let him be filled with malice! Let him wander in the season<br>of rains. Let him be a paid servant! Let him be the priest of the king!<br>Let him assist at the sacrifices of such impure persons as do not deserve<br>to be assisted at their sacrifices!'"<br><br>"Arundhati said, 'Let her who has stolen the lotus-stalks always<br>humiliate her mother-in-law! Let her be always vexed with her husband!<br>Let her eat whatever good things come to her house without sharing them<br>with others! Disregarding the kinsmen of her lord, let her live in her<br>husband's house and eat, at the day's close, the flour of fried barely!<br>Let her come to be regarded as unenjoyable (in consequence of the stains<br>that would tarnish her)! Let her be the mother of a heroic son![426]'"<br><br>"Ganda said, 'Let her who has stolen, the lotus-stalks be always a<br>speaker of falsehoods! Let her always quarrel with her kinsmen! Let her<br>bestow her daughter in marriage for a pecuniary consideration! Let her<br>eat the food which she has cooked, alone and without sharing it with<br>anybody! Let her pass her whole life in slavery! Indeed, let her who has<br>stolen the lotus-stalks be quick with child in consequence of sexual<br>congress under circumstances of guilt.'"<br><br>"Pasusakha said, 'Let him who has stolen the lotus-stalks be born of a<br>slave-mother. Let him have many children all of whom are worthless! And<br>let him never bow to the deities.'"<br><br>"Sunahsakha said, 'Let him who has removed the lotus-stalks obtain the<br>merit of bestowing his daughter in marriage upon a Brahmana, who has<br>studied all the Samans and the Yajuses and who has carefully observed the<br>vow of Brahmacharya, Let him perform the final ablutions after having<br>studied all the Atharvans!'"<br><br>"All the Rishis said, 'The oath thou hast taken is no oath at all, for<br>all the acts which thou hast mentioned are very desirable for the<br>Brahmanas! It is evident, O Sunahsakha, that thou hast appropriated our<br>lotus-stalks!'"<br><br>"Sunahsakha said, 'The lotus stalks deposited by you not being seen, what<br>you say is perfectly true, for it is I who have actually stolen them. In<br>the very sight of all of you I have caused the disappearance of those<br>stalks! Ye sinless ones, the act was done by me from desire of testing<br>you! I came hither for protecting you. That woman who lies slain there<br>was called Yatudhani. She was of a fierce disposition. Sprung from the<br>incantations of king Vrishadarbhi, she had come here from the desire of<br>slaying all of you! You ascetics endued with wealth of penances, egged on<br>by that king, she had come, but I have slain her. That wicked and sinful<br>creature, sprung from the sacrificial fire, would otherwise have taken<br>your lives. It was for killing her and saving you that I came here, ye<br>learned Brahmanas! Know that I am Vasava! Ye have completely freed<br>yourselves from the influence of cupidity. In consequence of this, ye<br>have won many eternal regions fraught with the fruition of every wish as<br>soon as it rises in the heart! Do ye rise, without delay, from this place<br>and repair to those regions of beatitude, ye regenerate ones, that are<br>reserved for you!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The great Rishis, highly gratified at this, replied<br>unto Purandara, saying, 'So be it!' They then ascended to heaven in<br>company of Indra himself. Even thus, those high-souled persons, though<br>famishing with hunger and though tempted at such a time with the offer of<br>diverse kinds of enjoyable articles, refrained from yielding to<br>temptation. As the result of such self-denial, they attained to heaven.<br>It seems, therefore, that one should, under all circumstances, cast off<br>cupidity from oneself. Even this, O king, is the highest duty. Cupidity<br>should be cast off. The man who recites this account (of the deeds of the<br>righteous Rishis) in assemblies of men, succeeds in acquiring wealth.<br>Such a man has never to attain to a distressful end. The Pitris, the<br>Rishis, and the deities become all pleased with him. Hereafter, again, he<br>becomes endued with fame and religious merit and wealth!'"
