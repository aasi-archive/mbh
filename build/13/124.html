                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Which is of superior efficacy, Conciliation or<br>Gifts? Tell me, O chief of Bharata's race, which of these two is superior<br>in point of efficacy.'<br><br>'Bhishma said, 'Some become gratified by conciliation, while others are<br>gratified by gifts. Every man, according to his own nature, affects the<br>one or the other. Listen to me, O king, as I explain to thee the merits<br>of conciliation, O chief of Bharata's race, so that the most furious<br>creatures may be appeased by it. In this connection is cited the ancient<br>narrative of how a Brahmana, who had been seized in the forest by a<br>Rakshasa, was freed (with the aid of conciliation). A certain Brahmana,<br>endued with eloquence and intelligence, fell into distress, for he was<br>seized in a lone forest by a Rakshasa who wished to feed on him. The<br>Brahmana, possessed of understanding and learning, was not at all<br>agitated.' Without suffering himself to be stupefied at the sight of that<br>terrible cannibal, he resolved to apply conciliation and see its effect<br>on the Rakshasa. The Rakshasa, respectfully saluting the Brahmana so far<br>as words went, asked him this question, 'Thou shalt escape, but tell me<br>for what reason I am pale of hue and so lean!' Reflecting for a brief<br>space of time, the Brahmana accepted the question of the Rakshasa and<br>replied in the following well-spoken words'.<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'Dwelling in a place that is distant from thy abode,<br>moving in a sphere that is not thy own, and deprived of the companionship<br>of thy friends and kinsmen, thou art enjoying vast affluence. It is for<br>this that thou art so pale and lean. Verily, O Rakshasa, thy friends,<br>though well-treated by thee, are still not well-disposed towards thee in<br>consequence of their own vicious nature. It is for this that thou art<br>pale and lean. Thou art endued with merit and wisdom and a well-regulated<br>soul. Yet it is thy lot to see others that are destitute of merit and<br>wisdom honoured in preference to thyself. It is for this that thou art<br>pale and lean. Persons possessed of wealth and affluence much greater<br>than thine but inferior to thee in point of accomplishments are, verily,<br>disregarding thee. It is for this that thou art pale and lean. Though<br>distressed through want of the means of support, thou art led by the<br>highness of thy soul to disregard such means as are open to thee for<br>drawing thy sustenance. It is for this that thou art pale and lean. In<br>consequence of thy righteousness thou hadst stinted thyself for doing<br>good to another, This other, O righteous Rakshasa, thinks thee deceived<br>and subjugated (by his superior intelligence). It is for this that thou<br>art pale and lean. I think, thou art grieving for those persons who with<br>souls overwhelmed by the lust and wrath are suffering misery in this<br>world. It is for this that thou art pale and lean. Though graced with the<br>possession of wisdom, thou art ridiculed by others who are entirely<br>destitute of it. Verily, persons of wicked conduct are condemning thee.<br>It is for this that thou art pale and lean. Verily, some enemy of thine,<br>with a friendly tongue, coming to thee behaved at first like a righteous<br>person and then has left thee, beguiling thee like a knave. It is for<br>this that thou art pale and lean. Thou art well-conversant with the<br>course of world's affairs. Thou art well-skilled in all mysteries. Thou<br>art endued with capacity. Those who know thee to be such do not yet<br>respect and praise thee. It is for this that thou art pale and lean.<br>Staying in the midst of bad men engaged together in some enterprise, thou<br>hadst discoursed to them, dispelling their doubts. For all that they did<br>not admit thy superior merits. It is for this that thou art pale and<br>lean. Verily, though destitute of wealth and intelligence and Vedic lore,<br>thou desirest yet, with the aid of thy energy alone, to accomplish<br>something great. It is for this that thou art pale and lean. It seems<br>that although thou art resolved to undergo severe austerities by retiring<br>into the forest, yet thy kinsmen art not favourably inclined towards this<br>project of thine. It is this for that thou art pale and lean. Some<br>neighbour of thine, possessed of great wealth and endued with youth and<br>handsome features, verily, covets thy dear spouse. It is for this that<br>thou art pale and lean. The words spoken by thee, even when excellent, in<br>the midst of wealthy men, are not regarded by them as wise or well-timed.<br>It is for this that thou art pale and lean. Some dear kinsman of thine,<br>destitute of intelligence though repeatedly instructed in the scriptures,<br>has become angry. Thou hast not succeeded in pacifying him. It is for<br>this that thou art pale and lean. Verily, some-body, having first set<br>thee to the accomplishment of some object desirable to thee is now<br>seeking to snatch the fruit thereof from thy grasp. It is for this that<br>thou art pale and lean. Verily, though possessed of excellent<br>accomplishments and worshipped by all on that account, thou art yet<br>regarded by thy kinsmen as worshipped for their sake and not for thy own.<br>It is for this that thou art pale and lean. Verily, through shame thou<br>art unable to give out some purpose in thy heart, moved also by the<br>inevitable delay that will occur in its accomplishment. It is for this<br>that thou art pale and lean. Verily, thou desirest, with the aid of thy<br>intelligence, to bring under thy influence, diverse persons with diverse<br>kinds of understandings and inclinations. It is for this that thou art<br>pale and lean.[537] Destitute of learning, without courage, and without<br>much wealth, thou seekest such fame as is won by knowledge and prowess<br>and gifts. Verily, it is for this that thou hast been pale and lean. Thou<br>hast not been able to acquire something upon which thou hast set thy<br>heart for a long time. Or, that which thou seekest to do is sought to be<br>undone by somebody else. It is for this that thou art pale and lean.<br>Verily, without being able to see any fault on thy part, thou hast been<br>cursed by somebody. It is for this that thou art pale and lean.[538]<br>Destitute of both wealth and accomplishments thou seekest in vain to<br>dispel the grief of thy friends and the sorrows of sorrowing men. It is<br>for this that thou art pale and lean. Beholding righteous persons the<br>domestic mode of life, unrighteous persons living according to the forest<br>mode, and emancipated persons attached to domesticity and fixed abodes,<br>thou hast become pale and lean. Verily, thy acts connected with<br>Righteousness, with Wealth, and with Pleasure, as also the well-timed<br>words spoken by thee, do not bear fruit. It is for this that thou art<br>pale and lean. Though endued with wisdom, yet desirous of living, thou<br>livest with wealth obtained by thee in gift from somebody of evil<br>conduct. It is for this that thou art pale and lean. Beholding<br>unrighteousness increasing on every side and righteousness languishing,<br>thou art filled with grief. It is for this that thou art pale and lean.<br>Urged by time thou seekest to please all thy friends even when they are<br>disputing and ranged on sides opposite to one another. It is for this<br>that thou art pale and lean. Beholding persons possessed of Vedic lore<br>engaged in improper acts, and persons of learning unable to keep their<br>senses under control, thou art filled with grief. It is for this that<br>thou art pale and lean.' Thus praised, the Rakshasa worshipped that<br>learned Brahmana in return, and making him his friend and bestowing<br>sufficient wealth upon him in gift, let him off (without devouring him).'"
