                            "Bhishma said, 'They who make gifts of kine, and who subsist upon the<br>remnants of things offered as libations on the sacred fire, are regarded,<br>O Yudhishthira, as always performing sacrifices of every kind. No<br>sacrifice can be performed without the aid of curds and ghee. The very<br>character as sacrifice which sacrifices have, depends upon ghee. Hence<br>ghee (or, the cow from which it is produced) is regarded as the very root<br>of sacrifice. Of all kinds of gifts, the gift of kine is applauded as the<br>highest. Kine are the foremost of all things. Themselves sacred, they are<br>the best of cleansers and sanctifiers. People should cherish kine for<br>obtaining prosperity and even peace. The milk, curds, and ghee that kine<br>yield are capable of cleansing one from every kind of sin. Kine are said<br>to represent the highest energy both in this world and the world that is<br>above. There is nothing that is more sacred or sanctifying than kine, O<br>chief of Bharata's race. In this connection is recited the ancient<br>narrative, O Yudhishthira, of the discourse between the Grandsire and the<br>chief of celestials. After the Daityas had been defeated and Sakra had<br>become the lord of the three worlds all creatures grew in prosperity and<br>became devoted to the true religion. Then, on one occasion, the Rishis,<br>the Gandharvas, the Kinnaras, the Uragas, the Rakshasas, the Deities, the<br>Asuras, the winged creatures and the Prajapatis, O thou of Kuru's race,<br>all assembled together and adored the Grandsire. There were Narada and<br>Parvata and Viswavasu and Haha-Huhu, who sang in celestial strains for<br>adoring that puissant lord of all creatures. The deity of wind bore<br>thither the fragrance of celestial flowers. The Seasons also, in their<br>embodied forms, bore the perfumes of flowers peculiar to each, unto that<br>conclave of celestials, that gathering of all creatures of the universe,<br>where celestial maidens danced and sang in accompaniment with celestial<br>music. In the midst of that assembly, Indra, saluting the Lord of all the<br>deities and bowing his head unto him with reverence, asked him, saying,<br>'I desire, O Grandsire, to know why the region of kine is higher, O holy<br>one, than the region of the deities themselves who are the lords of all<br>the worlds. What austerities, what Brahmacharya, O lord, did kine perform<br>in consequence of which they are able to reside happily in a region that<br>is even above that of the deities?' Thus addressed by Indra, Brahman said<br>unto the slayer of Vala, 'Thou hast always, O slayer of Vala, disregarded<br>kine. Hence, thou art not acquainted with the glorious pre-eminence of<br>kine. Listen now to me, O puissant one, as I explain to thee the high<br>energy and glorious pre-eminence of kine, O chief of the celestials! Kine<br>have been said to be the limbs of sacrifice. They represent sacrifice<br>itself, O Vasava! Without them, there can be no sacrifice. With their<br>milk and the Havi produced therefrom, they uphold all creatures. Their<br>male calves are engaged in assisting at tillage and thereby produce<br>diverse kinds of paddy and other seeds. From them flow sacrifices and<br>Havya and Kavya, and milk and curds and ghee. Hence, O chief of the<br>deities, kine are sacred. Afflicted by hunger and thirst, they bear<br>diverse burdens. Kine support the Munis. They uphold all creatures by<br>diverse acts, O Vasava, kine are guileless in their behaviour. In<br>consequence of such behaviour and of many well-performed acts, they are<br>enabled to live always in regions that are even above ours. I have thus<br>explained to thee today, O thou of a hundred sacrifices, the reason, O<br>Sakra of kine residing in a place that is high above that of the deities.<br>Kine obtained many excellent forms, O Vasava, and are themselves givers<br>of boons (to others). They are called Surabhis. Of sacred deeds and<br>endued with many auspicious indications, they are highly sanctifying<br>Listen to me also, O slayer of Vala, as I tell thee in detail the reason<br>why kine,&#8212;the offspring of Surabhi,&#8212;have descended on the earth, O best<br>of the deities. In day of yore, O son, when in the Devayuga the high<br>soused Danavas became lords of the three world, Aditi underwent the<br>severest austerities and got Vishnu within her womb (as the reward<br>thereof). Verify, O chief of the celestials, she had stood upon one leg<br>for many long years, desirous of having a son.[382] Beholding the great<br>goddess Aditi thus undergoing the severest austerities, the daughter of<br>Daksha, viz., the illustrious Surabhi, herself devoted to righteousness,<br>similarly underwent very severe austerities upon the breast of the<br>delightful mountains of Kailasa that are resorted to by both the deities<br>and the Gandharvas. Established on the highest Yoga she also stood upon<br>one leg for eleven thousand years. The deities with the Rishis and the<br>great Nagas all became scorched with the severity of her penances.<br>Repairing thither with me, all of them began to adore that auspicious<br>goddess. I then addressed that goddess endued with penances and said, 'O<br>goddess, O thou of faultless conduct, for what purpose, dost thou undergo<br>such severe austerities. O highly blessed one, I am gratified with thy<br>penances, O beautiful one! Do thou, O goddess, solicit what boon thou<br>desirest. I shall grant thee whatever thou mayst ask.' Even these were my<br>words unto her, O Purandara. Thus addressed by me, Surabhi answered me,<br>saying, 'I have no need, O Grandsire, of boons. Even this, O sinless one,<br>is a great boon to me that thou hast been gratified with me.' Unto the<br>illustrious Surabhi, O chief of the celestials who said so unto me, O<br>lord of Sachi, I answered even in these words, O foremost of the deities,<br>viz., 'O goddess, at this exhibition of thy freedom from cupidity and<br>desire and at these penances of thine, O thou of beautiful face, I have<br>been exceedingly gratified. I, therefore, grant thee the boon of<br>immortality. Thou shalt dwell in a region that is higher than the three<br>worlds, through my grace. That region shall be known to all by the name<br>of Goloka. Thy offspring, ever engaged in doing good acts, will reside in<br>the world of men. In fact, O highly blessed one, thy daughters will<br>reside there. All kinds of enjoyment, celestial and human, that thou<br>mayst think of, will immediately be thine. Whatever happiness exists in<br>Heaven, will also be thine, O blessed one.' The regions, O thou of a<br>hundred eyes, that are Surabhi's are endued with means for the<br>gratification of every wish. Neither Death, nor Decrepitude, nor fire,<br>can overcome its denizens. No ill luck, O Vasava, exists there. Many<br>delightful woods, and delightful ornaments and objects of beauty may be<br>seen there. There many beautiful cars, all excellently equipped, which<br>move at the will of the rider, may be seen, O Vasava, O thou of eyes like<br>lotus-petals, it is only by Brahmacharya, by penances, by Truth, by<br>self-restraint, by gifts, by diverse kinds of righteous deeds, by<br>sojourns to sacred waters, in fact, by severe austerities and righteous<br>acts well-performed, that one can attain to Goloka. Thou hast asked me, O<br>Sakra, and I have answered the in full, O slayer of Asuras, thou shouldst<br>never disregard kine.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Having heard these words of the self-born Brahman, O<br>Yudhishthira, Sakra of a thousand eyes began from that time to worship<br>kine every day and to show them the greatest respect. I have thus told<br>thee everything about the sanctifying character of kine, O thou of greet<br>splendour. The sacred and high pre-eminence and glory of kine, that is<br>capable of cleansing one from every sin, has, O chief of men, been thus<br>explained to thee. That man who with senses withdrawn from every other<br>object will recite this account unto Brahmanas, on occasions when Havya<br>and Kavya are offered, or at sacrifices, or on occasions of adoring the<br>Pitris, succeeds in conferring upon his ancestors an inexhaustible<br>felicity fraught with the fruition of every wish. That man who is devoted<br>to kine succeeds in obtaining the fruition of every wish of his. Indeed,<br>even those women that are devoted to kine succeed in obtaining the<br>accomplishment of every wish of theirs. He that desireth sons obtaineth<br>them. He that desireth daughters obtaineth them. He that desireth wealth<br>succeedeth in aquiring it and he that desireth religious merit succeedeth<br>in winning it. He that desireth knowledge acquireth it and he that<br>desireth felicity succeedeth in acquiring it. Indeed, O Bharata, there is<br>nothing that is unattainable to one that is devoted to kine.'"
