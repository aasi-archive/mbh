                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I desire to hear, O grandsire, what the merits are<br>of that person who makes the gift of a pair of sandals unto a Brahmana<br>whose feet are burning or being scorched by hot sand, while he is<br>walking.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The man, that gives unto the Brahmanas sandals for the<br>protection of their feet, succeeds in crushing all thorns and gets over<br>every kind of difficulty. Such a man, O Yudhishthira, stays over the<br>heads of all his foes. Vehicles of pure splendour, with mules harnessed<br>thereto, and made of gold and silver, O monarch, approach him. He who<br>makes a gift of sandals is said to earn the merit of making the gift of a<br>vehicle with well-broken steeds yoked thereto.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Do thou tell me in detail once more, O grandsire, of<br>the merits that attach to gifts of sesame and land and kine and food.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Do thou hear, O son of Kunti, what the merits are that<br>attach to the gift of sesame. Hearing me, do thou, then, O best of the<br>Kurus, make gifts of sesame according to the ordinance. Sesame seeds were<br>created by the Self-born Brahman as the best food for the Pitris. Hence,<br>gifts of sesame seeds always gladden the Pitris greatly. The man who<br>makes gifts of sesame seeds, in the month of Magha, unto the Brahmanas,<br>has never to visit hell which abounds with all frightful creatures. He<br>who adores the Pitris with offerings of sesame seeds is regarded as<br>worshipping the deities at all the sacrifices. One should never perform a<br>Sraddha with offerings of sesame seeds without cherishing some<br>purpose.[340] Sesame seeds sprang from the limbs of the great Rishi<br>Kasyapa. Hence, in the matter of gifts, they have come to be regarded as<br>possessed of high efficacy. Sesame seeds bestow both prosperity and<br>personal beauty and cleans the giver of all his sins It is for this<br>reason that the gift of sesame seeds is distinguished above the gift of<br>every other article. Apastamva of great intelligence, and Kankha and<br>Likhita, and the great Rishi Gautama have all ascended to heaven by<br>having made gifts of sesame seeds. Those Brahmanas that make Homa with<br>offerings of sesame, abstain from sexual intercourse, and are observant<br>of the religion of Pravritti or acts, are regarded as equal (in purity<br>and efficacy) to bovine Havi. The gift of sesame seeds is distinguished<br>above all gifts. Amongst all gifts, the gifts of sesame is regarded as<br>productive of inexhaustible merit. In ancient times when Havi (clarified<br>butter) on one occasion had become unobtainable the Rishi Kusika, O<br>scorcher of foes, made offerings of sesame seeds to his three sacrificial<br>fires and succeeded in attaining to an excellent end. I have thus said<br>unto thee, O chief of the Kurus, what the regulations are respecting the<br>excellent gift of sesame seeds. It is in consequence of these regulations<br>that the gift of sesame seeds has come to be regarded as endued with very<br>superior merit. After this, listen to what I would say. Once on a time<br>the deities, desirous of making a sacrifice, repaired, O monarch, to the<br>presence of the Self-born Brahman. Having met Brahman, being desirous of<br>performing a sacrifice on earth, they begged him for a piece of<br>auspicious earth, saying, 'We want it for our sacrifice.'<br><br>'The deities said, 'O illustrious one, thou art the lord of all the earth<br>as also of all the deities. With thy permission, O highly blessed one, we<br>desire to perform a sacrifice. The person who has not obtained by lawful<br>means the earth whereon to make the sacrificial altar, earns not the<br>merit of the sacrifice he performs. Thou art the Lord of all the universe<br>consisting of its mobile and immobile objects. Hence, it behoveth thee to<br>grant us a piece of earth for the sacrifice we wish to make.'<br><br>"Brahman said, 'Ye foremost of deities, I shall give you a piece of earth<br>whereon, ye sons of Kasyapa, you shall perform your intended sacrifice.'<br><br>"The deities said, 'Our wishes, O holy one, have been crowned with<br>fruition. We shall perform our sacrifice even here with large Dakshina.<br>Let, however, the Munis always adore the piece of earth. Then there came<br>to that place Agastya and Kanwa and Bhrigu and Atri and Vrishakapi, and<br>Asita and Devala. The high-souled deities then, O thou of unfading glory,<br>performed their sacrifice. Those foremost of gods concluded it in due<br>time. Having completed that sacrifice of theirs on the breast of that<br>foremost of mountains. Himavat, the deities attached to the gift of earth<br>a sixth part of the merit arising from their sacrifice. The man who makes<br>a gift of even a span of earth (unto a Brahmana) with reverence and<br>faith, has never to languish under any difficulty and has never to meet<br>with any calamity. By making a gift of a house that keeps out cold, wind,<br>and sun, and that stand upon a piece of clean land, the giver attains to<br>the region of the deities and does not fall down even when his merit<br>becomes exhausted. By making a gift of a residential house, the giver,<br>possessed of wisdom, lives, O king, in happiness in the company of Sakra.<br>Such a person receives great honours in heaven. That person in whose<br>house a Brahmana of restrained sense, well-versed in the Vedas, and<br>belonging by birth to a family of preceptors, resides in contentment,<br>succeeds in attaining to and enjoying a region of high felicity.[341]<br>After the same manner, O best of the Bharatas, by giving away a shed for<br>the shelter of kine that can keep out cold and rain and that is<br>substantial in structure, the giver rescues seven generations of his race<br>(from hell). By giving away a piece of arable earth the giver attains to<br>excellent prosperity. By giving a piece of earth containing mineral<br>wealth, the giver aggrandises his family and race. One should never give<br>away any earth that is barren or that is burnt (arid); nor should one<br>give away any earth that is in close vicinity to a crematorium, or that<br>has been owned and enjoyed by a sinful person before such gift. When a<br>man performs a Sraddha in honour of the Pitris on earth belonging to<br>another person, the Pitris render both the gift of that earth and the<br>Sraddha itself futile.[342] Hence, one possessed of wisdom should buy<br>even a small piece of earth and make a gift of it. The Pinda that is<br>offered to one's ancestors on earth that has been duly purchased becomes<br>inexhaustible.[343] Forests, and mountains, and rivers, and Tirthas are<br>regarded as having no owners. No earth need be purchased here for<br>performing Sraddhas. Even this has been said, O king, on the subject of<br>the merits of making gifts of earth. After this, O sinless one, I shall<br>discourse to thee on the subject of the gift of kine. Kine are regarded<br>as superior to all the ascetics. And since it is so, the divine Mahadeva<br>for that reason performed penance in their company. Kine, O Bharata,<br>dwell in the region of Brahman, in the company of Soma. Constituting as<br>it does the highest end, regenerate Rishis crowned with success strive to<br>attain to that very region. Kine benefit human beings with milk, ghee,<br>curds, dung, skin, bones, horns, and hair, O Bharata. Kine do not feel<br>cold or heat. They always work. The season of rains also cannot afflict<br>them at all. And since kine attain to the highest end (viz., residence in<br>the region of Brahman), in the company of Brahmanas, therefore do the<br>wise say that king and Brahmanas are equal. In days of yore, king<br>Rantideva performed a grand sacrifice in which an immense number of kine<br>were offered up and slaughtered. From the juice that was secreted by the<br>skins of the slaughtered animals, a river was formed that came to be<br>called by the name of Charmanwati. Kine no longer form animals fit for<br>sacrifice. They now constitute animals that are fit for gift. That king<br>who makes gifts of kine unto the foremost of Brahmanas, O monarch, is<br>sure to get over every calamity even if he falls into it. The man who<br>makes a gift of a thousand kine has not to go to hell. Such a person, O<br>ruler of men, obtains victory everywhere. The very chief of the deities<br>had said that the milk of kine is nectar. For this reason, one who makes<br>a gift of a cow is regarded as making a gift of nectar. Persons<br>conversant with the Vedas have declared that the Ghee manufactured from<br>cows' milk is the very best of all libations poured into the sacrificial<br>fire. For this reason, the man who makes a gift of a cow is regarded as<br>making a gift of a libation for sacrifice. A bovine bull is the<br>embodiment of heaven. He who makes the gift of a bovine bull unto an<br>accomplished Brahmana, receives great honours in heaven. Kine, O chief of<br>Bharata's race, are said to be the life-breath of living creatures.<br>Hence, the man who makes the gift of a cow is said to make the gift of<br>life-breath. Persons conversant with the Vedas have said that kine<br>constitute the great refuge of living creatures. Hence, the man who makes<br>the gift of a cow is regarded as making the gift of what is the high<br>refuge for all creatures. The cow should never be given away for<br>slaughter (i.e., unto one who will kill her); nor should the cow be given<br>unto a tiller of the soil; nor should the cow be given unto an atheist.<br>The cow should not also, O chief of the Bharatas, be given unto one whose<br>occupation is the keeping of kine.[344] The wise have said that a person<br>who gives away the cow unto any of such sinful persons has to sink into<br>everlasting hell. One should never give unto a Brahmana a cow that is<br>lean, or that produces calves that do not live, or that is barren, or<br>that is diseased, or that is defective of limb, or that is worn out with<br>toil. The man that gives away ten thousand kine attains to heaven and<br>sports in bliss in the companionship of Indra. The man who makes gifts of<br>kine by hundred thousand acquires many regions of inexhaustible felicity.<br>Thus have I recited to thee the merits attaching to the gift of kine and<br>of sesame, as also to the gift of earth. Listen now to me as I discourse<br>to thee upon the gift of food, O Bharata. The gift of food, O son of<br>Kunti, is regarded as a very superior gift. King Rantideva in days of<br>yore ascended to heaven by having made gifts of food. That king, who make<br>a gift of food unto one that is toil-worn and hungry, attains to that<br>region of supreme felicity which is the Self-born's own. Men fail to<br>attain by gifts of gold and robes and of other thing, to that felicity to<br>which givers of food succeed in attaining, O thou of great puissance!<br>Food is, indeed, the first article. Food is regarded as the highest<br>prosperity. It is from food that life springs, as also energy and prowess<br>and strength. He who always makes gifts of food, with attention, unto the<br>righteous, never falls into any distress.. Even this has been said by<br>Parasara. Having worshipped the deities duly, food should be first<br>dedicated to them. It has been said, O king, that the kind of food that<br>is taken by particular men is taken also by the deities those men<br>worship.[345] That man who makes a gift of food in the bright fortnight<br>of the month of Kartika, succeeds in crossing every difficulty here add<br>attains to inexhaustible felicity hereafter. That man who makes a gift of<br>food unto a hungry guest arrived at his abode, attains to all those<br>regions, O chief of Bharata's race, that are reserved for persons<br>acquainted with Brahma. The man who makes gifts of food is sure to cross<br>every difficulty and distress. Such a person comes over every sin and<br>cleanses himself of every evil act. I have thus discoursed to thee upon<br>the merits of making gifts of food, of sesame, of earth, and of kine.'"
