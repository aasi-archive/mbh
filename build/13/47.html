                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou art fully conversant with the ordinances of all<br>the scriptures. Thou art the foremost of those that are acquainted with<br>the duties of kings. Thou art celebrated over the whole world as a great<br>dispeller of doubts. I have a doubt, do thou explain it to me, O<br>grandsire! As regards this doubt that has arisen in my mind, I shall not<br>ask any other person for its solution. It behoveth thee, O thou of mighty<br>arms, to expound as to how a man should conduct himself who is desirous<br>of treading along the path of duty and righteousness. It has been laid<br>down, O grandsire, that a Brahmana can take four wives, viz., one that<br>belongs to his own order, one that is a Kshatriya, one that is a Vaisya,<br>and one that is a Sudra, if the Brahmana wishes to indulge in the desire<br>of sexual intercourse. Tell me, O best of the Kurus, which amongst those<br>sons deserves to inherit the father's wealth one after another? Who<br>amongst them, O grandsire, shall take what share of the paternal wealth?<br>I desire to hear this, viz., how the distribution has been ordained<br>amongst them of the paternal property.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The Brahmana, the Kshatriya, and the Vaisya are regarded<br>as the three regenerate orders. To wed in these three orders has been<br>ordained to be the duty of the Brahmana, O Yudhishthira. Through<br>erroneous judgment or cupidity or lust, O scorcher of foes, a Brahmana<br>takes a Sudra wife. Such a wife, however, he is not competent to take<br>according to the scriptures. A Brahmana, by taking a Sudra woman to his<br>bed, attains to a low end in the next world. He should, having done such<br>an act, undergo expiation according to the rites laid down in the<br>scriptures. That expiation must be twice heavier or severer if in<br>consequence of such an act, O Yudhishthira, the Brahmana gets offspring.<br>I shall now tell thee, O Bharata, how the (paternal) wealth is to be<br>distributed (among the children of the different spouses.) The son born<br>of the Brahmana wife shall, in the first place, appropriate from his<br>father's wealth a bull of good marks, and the best car or vehicle. What<br>remains of the Brahmana's property, O Yudhishthira, after this should be<br>divided into ten equal portions. The son by the Brahmana wife shall take<br>four of such portions of the paternal wealth. The son that is born of the<br>Kshatriya wife is, without doubt, possessed of the status of a Brahmana.<br>In consequence, however, of the distinction attaching to his mother, he<br>shall take three of the ten shares into which the property has been<br>divided. The son that has been born of the wife belonging to the third<br>order, viz., the woman of the Vaisya caste, by the Brahmana sire, shall<br>take, O Yudhishthira, two of the three remaining shares of the father's<br>property. It has been said that the son that has been begotten by the<br>Brahmana sire upon the Sudra wife should not take any portion of the<br>father's wealth, for he is not to be considered an heir. A little,<br>however, of the paternal wealth should be given to the son of the Sudra<br>wife, hence the one remaining share should be given to him out of<br>compassion. Even this should be the order of the ten shares into which<br>the Brahmana's wealth is to be divided. All the sons that are born of the<br>same mother or of mothers of the same order, shall share equally the<br>portion that is theirs. The son born of the Sudra wife should not be<br>regarded as invested with the status of a Brahmana in consequence of his<br>being unskilled (in the scriptures and the duties ordained for the<br>Brahmana). Only those children that are born of wives belonging to the<br>three higher orders should be regarded as invested with the status of<br>Brahmanas. It has been said that there are only four orders there is no<br>fifth that has been enumerated. The son by the Sudra wife shall take the<br>tenth part of his sire's wealth (that remains after the allotment has<br>been made to the others in the way spoken of). That share, however, he is<br>to take only when his sire has given it to him. He shall not take it if<br>his sire does not give it unto him. Some portion of the sire's wealth<br>should without doubt, be given, O Bharata, to the son of the Sudra wife.<br>Compassion is one of the highest virtues. It is through compassion that<br>something is given to the son of the Sudra wife. Whatever be the object<br>in respect of which compassion arises, as a cardinal virtue it is always<br>productive of merit. Whether the sire happens to have children (by his<br>spouses belonging to the other orders) or to have no children (by such<br>spouses), unto the son by the Sudra wife, O Bharata, nothing more than a<br>tenth part of the sire's wealth should be given. If a Brahmana happens to<br>have more wealth than what is necessary for maintaining himself and his<br>family for three years, he should with that wealth perform sacrifices. A<br>Brahmana should never acquire wealth for nothing.[295] The highest sum<br>that the husband should give unto the wife is three thousand coins (of<br>the prevailing currency). The wealth that the husband gives unto the<br>wife, the latter may spend or dispose of as she likes. Upon the death of<br>the childless husband, the wife shall enjoy all his wealth. (She shall<br>not, however, sell or otherwise dispose of any portion of it). The wife<br>should never take (without her husband's knowledge) any portion of her<br>husband's wealth. Whatever wealth, O Yudhishthira, the Brahmana wife may<br>acquire by gift from her father, should be taken (after her death) by her<br>daughter, for the daughter is like the son. The daughter, O king, has<br>been ordained in the scriptures, to be equal to the son, O delighter of<br>the Kurus. Even thus hath the law of inheritance been ordained, O bull of<br>Bharata's race. Remembering these ordinances about the distribution and<br>disposal of wealth, one should never acquire wealth uselessly.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'If the son born of a Sudra woman by a Brahmana<br>father has been declared in the scriptures to be disentitled to any<br>wealth, by what exceptional rule then is a tenth part of the paternal<br>property to be given to him? A son born of a Brahmana wife by a Brahmana<br>is unquestionably a Brahmana. One born of a Kshatriya wife or of a Vaisya<br>wife, by a Brahmana husband, is similarly invested with the status of a<br>Brahmana. Why then, O best of kings, are such sons to share the paternal<br>wealth unequally? All of them, thou hast said, are Brahmanas, having been<br>born of mothers that belong to the three higher orders equally entitled<br>to the name of regenerate.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O scorcher of foes, all spouses in this world are called<br>by the name of Data. Although that name is applied to all, yet there is<br>this great distinction to be observed. If, having married three wives<br>belonging to the three other orders, a Brahmana takes a Brahmana wife the<br>very last of all yet shall she be regarded as the first in rank among all<br>the wives, and as deserving of the greatest respect. Indeed, among all<br>the co-wives, she shall be the foremost in consideration. In her<br>apartments should be kept all those articles that are necessary in view<br>of the husband's baths, personal decorations, washing of teeth, and<br>application of collyrium to the eyes. In her apartments should be kept<br>the Havya and the Kavya and all else that the husband may require for the<br>performance of his religious acts. If the Brahmana wife is in the house,<br>no other wife is entitled to attend to these needs of the husband. Only<br>the Brahmana wife, O Yudhishthira, should assist in these acts of the<br>husband. The husband's food and drink and garlands and robes and<br>ornaments, all these should be given by the Brahmana wife to the husband,<br>for she is the foremost in rank and consideration among all the spouses<br>of the husband. These are the ordinances of the scriptures as laid down<br>by Manu, O delighter of the Kurus! Even this, O monarch, is seen to be<br>the course of eternal usage. If a Brahmana, O Yudhishthira, led by lust,<br>acts in a different way, he shall come to be regarded as a Chandala among<br>Brahmanas.[296] The son born of the Kshatriya wife has been said to be<br>equal in status to the son born of the Brahmana wife. For all that, a<br>distinction attaches to the son of the Brahmana wife in consequence of<br>the superiority of the Brahmana to the Kshatriya in respect of the order<br>of birth. The Kshatriya cannot be regarded as equal to the Brahmana woman<br>in point of birth. Hence, O best of kings, the son born of the Brahmana<br>wife must be regarded as the first in rank and superior to the son born<br>of the Kshatriya wife. Because, again the Kshatriya is not equal in point<br>of birth to the Brahmana wife, hence the son of the Brahmana wife takes<br>one after another, all the best things, O Yudhishthira, among his<br>father's possessions. Similarly, the Vaisya cannot be regarded as the<br>equal of the Kshatriya in point of birth. Prosperity, kingdom, and<br>treasury, O Yudhishthira, belong to the Kshatriya. All these have been<br>ordained for the Kshatriya. The whole earth, O king, with her belt of<br>seas, is seen to belong to him. By following the duties of his own order,<br>the Kshatriya acquires an extensive affluence. The sceptre of royalty is<br>held by him. Without the Kshatriya, O king, there can be no protection.<br>The Brahmanas are highly blessed, for they are the deities of the very<br>deities. Following the ordinances laid down by the Rishis, the Kshatriyas<br>should worship the Brahmanas according to due rites. Even this is the<br>eternal usage. Coveted by thieves and others, the possessions of all men<br>are protected by Kshatriyas in the observance of the duties assigned to<br>their order. Indeed, wealth and spouses and every other possession owned<br>by people would have been forcibly taken away but for this protection<br>that the Kshatriyas afford. The Kshatriya, as the king, becomes the<br>protector or rescuer of all the others. Hence, the son of the Kshatriya<br>wife shall, without doubt, be held to be superior to him that is born of<br>the Vaisya wife. The son of the Kshatriya wife, for this, takes a larger<br>share of the paternal property than the son of the Vaisya mother.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast duly said what the rules are that apply to<br>Brahmanas. What, however, are the rules that apply to the others?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'For the Kshatriya, O delighter of the Kurus, two wives<br>have been ordained. The Kshatriya may take a third wife from the Sudra<br>order. Such practice prevails, it is true, but it is not sanctioned by<br>the scriptures. Even this should be the order, O Yudhisthira, of the<br>spouses of a Kshatriya. The property of a Kshatriya should, O king, be<br>divided into eight shares. The son of the Kshatriya wife shall take four<br>of such shares of the paternal property. The son of the Vaisya wife shall<br>take three of such shares. The remaining one or the eighth share shall be<br>taken by the son of the Sudra wife. The son of the Sudra wife, however,<br>shall take only when the father gives but not otherwise. For the Vaisya<br>only one wife has been ordained. A second wife is taken from the Sudra<br>order. The practice prevails, it is true, but it is not sanctioned by the<br>scriptures. If a Vaisya has two wives, one of whom is a Vaisya and the<br>other a Sudra, there is a difference between them in respect of status.<br>The wealth of a Vaisya, O chief of Bharata's race, should be divided Into<br>five portions. I shall now speak of the sons of a Vaisya by a wife of his<br>own order and by one belonging to the inferior order, as also of the<br>manner in which, O king his wealth is to be distributed among those<br>children. The son born of the Vaisya wife shall take four of such shares<br>of his father's wealth. The fifth share, O Bharata, has been said to<br>belong to the son born of the Sudra wife. Such a son, however, shall take<br>when the father gives. He should not take anything unless the father<br>gives it to him. The son that is begotten on a Sudra wife by persons of<br>the three higher orders should always be regarded as disentitled to any<br>share of the sire's wealth. The Sudra should have only one wife taken<br>from his own order. He can under no circumstances, take any other spouse.<br>Even if he happens to have a century of sons by such a spouse, all of<br>them share equally the wealth that he may leave behind. As regards all<br>the orders, the children born of the spouse taken from the husband's own<br>order shall, it has been laid down, share equally the father's wealth.<br>The eldest son's share shall be greater than that of every other son, for<br>he shall take one share more than each of his brothers, consisting of the<br>best things of his father. Even this is the law of inheritance, O son of<br>Pritha, as declared by the Self-born himself. Amongst children all born<br>of the spouse taken from the husband's own order, there is another<br>distinction, O king! In marrying, the elder ones should always precede<br>the younger ones. The spouses being all equal in respect of their order<br>of birth, and the children also being all equal in respect of the status<br>of their mothers, the son that is first-born shall take one share more<br>than each of his other brothers. The son that comes next in point of age<br>shall take a share that is next in value, while the son that is youngest<br>shall take the share that belongs to the youngest.[297] Thus among<br>spouses of all orders, they that belong to the same order with the<br>husband are regarded as the first. Even this is what was declared by the<br>great Rishi Kasyapa the son of Marichi.'
