                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Who deserve to be worshipped? Who are they unto whom<br>we should bow? How, indeed, should we behave towards whom? What course of<br>conduct, O grandsire, towards what classes of persons is regarded<br>faultless?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The humiliation of Brahmanas would humiliate the very<br>deities. By bowing unto Brahmanas one does not, O Yudhishthira, incur any<br>fault. They, deserve to be worshipped. They deserve to have our<br>Salutations. Thou shouldst behave towards them as if they are thy sons.<br>Indeed, it is those men endued with great wisdom that uphold all the<br>worlds. The Brahmanas are the great causeways of Righteousness in respect<br>of all the worlds. Their happiness consists in renouncing all kinds of<br>wealth. They are devoted to the vow of restraining speech. They are<br>agreeable to all creatures, and observant of diverse excellent vows. They<br>are the refuge of all creatures in the universe. They are the authors of<br>all the regulations which govern the worlds. They are possessed of great<br>fame Penances are always their great wealth. Their power consists in<br>speech. Their energy flows from the duties they observe. Conversant with<br>all duties, they are possessed of minute vision, so that they are<br>cognizant of the subtlest considerations. They are of righteous desires.<br>They live the observance of well-performed duties. They are the causeways<br>of Righteousness. The four kinds of living creatures exist, depending<br>upon them as their refuge. They are the path or road along which all<br>should go. They are the guides of all. They are the eternal upholders of<br>all the sacrifices. They always uphold the heavy burdens of sires and<br>grandsires. They never droop under heavy weights even when passing along<br>difficult-roads like strong cattle. They are attentive to the<br>requirements of Piths and deities and guests. They are entitled to eat<br>the first portions of Havya and Kavya. By the very food they eat, they<br>rescue the three worlds from great fear. They are as it were, the Island<br>(for refuge) for all worlds. They are the eyes of all persons endued with<br>sight. The wealth they possess consists of all the branches of knowledge<br>known by the name of Siksha and all the Srutis. Endued with great skill,<br>they are conversant with the most subtle relations of things. They are<br>well-acquainted with the end of all things, and their thoughts are always<br>employed upon the science of the soul. They are endued with the knowledge<br>of the beginning, the middle, and the end of all things, and they are<br>persons in whom doubts no longer exist in consequence of feeling certain<br>of their knowledge. They are fully aware of the distinctions between what<br>is superior and what is inferior. They it is who attain to the highest<br>end. Freed from all attachments, cleansed of all sins, transcending all<br>pairs of opposites (such as heat and cold, happiness and misery, etc.),<br>they are unconnected with all worldly things. Deserving of every honour,<br>they are always held in great esteem by persons endued with knowledge and<br>high souls. They cast equal eyes on sandal-paste and filth or dirt, on<br>what is food and what is not rood. They see with an equal eye their brown<br>vestments of coarse cloth and fabrics of silk and animal skins. They<br>would live for many days together without eating any food, and dry up<br>their limbs by such abstention from all sustenance. They devote<br>themselves earnestly to the study of the Vedas, restraining their senses.<br>They would make gods of those that are not gods, and not gods of those<br>that are gods. Enraged, they can create other worlds and other Regents of<br>the worlds than those that exist. Through the course of those high-souled<br>ones, the ocean became so saline as to be undrinkable. The fire of their<br>wrath yet burns in the forest of Dandaka, unquenched by time. They are<br>the gods of the gods, and the cause of all cause. They are the authority<br>of all authorities. What man of intelligence and wisdom is there that<br>would seek to humiliate them? Amongst them the young and the old all<br>deserve honours. They honour one another (not in consequence of<br>distinctions of age but) in consequence of distinctions in respect of<br>penances and knowledge. Even the Brahmana that is destitute of knowledge<br>is a god and is a high instrument for cleansing others. He amongst them,<br>then, that is possessed of knowledge is a much higher god and like unto<br>the ocean when full (to the brim). Learned or unlearned, Brahmana is<br>always a high deity. Sanctified or unsanctified (with the aid of<br>Mantras), Fire is ever a great deity. A blazing fire even when it burns<br>on a crematorium, is not regarded as tainted in consequence of the<br>character of the spot whereon it burns. Clarified butter looks beautiful<br>whether kept on the sacrificial altar or in a chamber. So, if a Brahmana<br>be always engaged in evil acts, he is still to be regarded as deserving<br>of honour. Indeed, know that the Brahmana is always a high deity.'"
