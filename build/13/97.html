                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O foremost one of Bharata's race, do thou relate to<br>me all the duties of the household mode and tell me all that a man should<br>do in order to attain to prosperity in this world.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O Bharata, I shall, in this connection, recite to thee<br>the old story of Vasudeva and the goddess Earth, The puissant Vasudeva. O<br>excellent prince of Bharata's race, after hymning the praises of the<br>goddess Earth, questioned her about this very topic that thou hast<br>enquired about.'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'Having adopted the state of a householder, what acts<br>should I, or one like me, perform and how are such acts to fructify in<br>good?'"<br><br>"The goddess Earth said, 'O Madhava, the Rishis, the deities, the Pitris,<br>and men should be worshipped, and sacrifices should be performed, by a<br>householder. Do thou also learn this from me that the deities are always<br>pleased with sacrifices, and men are gratified with hospitality.<br>Therefore, the householder should gratify them with such objects as they<br>desire. By such acts, O slayer of Madhu, the Rishis also are gratified.<br>The householder, abstaining from food, should daily attend to his sacred<br>fire and to his sacrificial offerings. The deities, O slayer of Madhu,<br>are gratified with such acts. The householder should daily offer<br>oblations of food and water, or of fruits, roots and water, for the<br>gratification of the Pitris, and the Vaiswadeva offering should be<br>performed with rice boiled, and oblations of clarified butter unto Agni,<br>Soma, and Dhanwantari. He should offer separate and distinct oblations<br>unto Prajapati. He should make sacrificial offerings in due order; to<br>Yama in the Southern region, to Varuna in Western region, to Soma in the<br>Northern region, to Prajapati within the homestead, to Dhanwantari in the<br>North-eastern region, and to Indra in the Eastern region. He should offer<br>food to men at the entrance of his house. These, O Madhava, are known as<br>the Vali offerings. The Vali should be offered to the Maruts and the<br>deities in the interior of one's house. To the Viswedevas it should be<br>offered in open air, and to the Rakshasas and spirits the offerings<br>should be made at night. After making these offerings, the householder<br>should make offerings unto Brahmanas, and if no Brahmana be present, the<br>first portion of the food should be thrown into the fire. When a man<br>desires to offer Sraddha to his ancestors, he should, when the Sraddha<br>ceremony is concluded, gratify his ancestors and then make the Vali<br>offerings in due order. He should then make offerings unto the<br>Viswedevas. He should next invite Brahmanas and then properly regale<br>guests arrived at his house, with food. By this act, O prince, are guests<br>gratified. He who does not stay in the house long, or, having come, goes<br>away after a short time, is called a guest. To his preceptor, to his<br>father, to his friend and to a guest, a householder should say, 'I have<br>got this in my house to offer thee today!' And he should offer it<br>accordingly every day. The householder should do whatever they would ask<br>him to do. This is the established usage. The householder, O Krishna,<br>should take his food last of all after having offered food to all of<br>them. The householder should worship, with offerings of Madhuparka his<br>king, his priest, his preceptor, and his father-in-law as also Snataka<br>Brahmanas even if they were to stay in his house for a whole year. In the<br>morning as well as in the evening, food should be offered on the ground<br>to dogs, Swapachas,[438] and birds. This is called the Vaiswadeva<br>offering. The householder, who performs these ceremonies with a mind<br>unclouded by passion, obtains the blessings of the Rishis in this world,<br>and after death attains to the heavenly regions.'"<br><br>"Bhishma continued, "The puissant Vasudeva, having listened to all this<br>from the goddess Earth, acted accordingly. Do thou also act in the same<br>way. By performing these duties of a householder, O king, thou shalt<br>acquire fame in this world and attain to heaven after death!'"
