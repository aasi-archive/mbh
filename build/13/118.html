                            "Vyasa said, 'It is in consequence of a meritorious act, O worm, that<br>thou, though born in the intermediate order of being, art not stupefied.<br>That act is mine, O worm, in consequence of which thou art not<br>stupefied.[527] In consequence of the puissance of my penances, I am able<br>to rescue a being of demerit by granting him a sight only of my person.<br>There is no stronger might than the might that attaches to penances, I<br>know, O worm, that thou hast taken birth in the order of worms through<br>the evil acts of thy past life. If, however, thou thinkest of attaining<br>to righteousness and merit, thou mayst again attain to it. Deities as<br>well as beings crowned with ascetic success, enjoy or endure the<br>consequence of acts done by them in this field of action. Amongst men<br>also, when acts of merit are performed, they are performed from desire of<br>fruit (and not with disregard for fruit). The very accomplishment that<br>one seeks to acquire are sought from desire of the happiness they will<br>bring.[528] Learned or ignorant (in a former life) the creature that is,<br>in this life, destitute of speech and understanding and hands and feet,<br>is really destitute of everything.[529] He that becomes a superior<br>Brahmana adores, while alive, the deities of the sun and the moon,<br>uttering diverse sacred Mantras. O worm, thou shalt attain to that state<br>of existence. Attaining to that status, thou wilt enjoy all the elements<br>converted into articles of enjoyment. When thou hast attained to that<br>state, I shall impart to thee Brahma. Or, if thou wishest, I may place<br>thee in any other status!' The worm, agreeing to the words of Vyasa, did<br>not leave the road, but remained on it. Meanwhile, the large vehicle<br>which was coming in that direction came to that spot.[530] Torn to pieces<br>by the assault of the wheels, the worm gave up his life-breath. Born at<br>last in the Kshatriya order through the grace of Vyasa of immeasurable<br>puissance, he proceeded to see the great Rishi. He had, before becoming a<br>Kshatriya, to pass through diverse orders of being, such as hedgehog and<br>Iguana and boar and deer and bird, and Chandala and Sudra and Vaisya.<br>Having given an account of his various transformations unto the<br>truth-telling Rishi, and remembering the Rishi's kindness for him, the<br>worm (now transformed into a Kshatriya) with joined palms fell at the<br>Rishi's feet and touched them with his head.'<br><br>"The worm said, 'My present status is that high one which is coveted by<br>all and which is attainable by the possession of the ten well-known<br>attributes. Indeed, I who was formerly a worm have thus attained to the<br>status of a prince. Elephants of great strength, decked with golden<br>chains, bear me on their backs. Unto my cars are yoked Kamvoja steeds of<br>high mettle. Numerous vehicles, unto which are attached camels and mules,<br>bear me. With all my relatives and friends I now eat food rich with meat.<br>Worshipped by all, sleep, O highly blessed one, on costly beds in<br>delightful rooms into which disagreeable winds cannot blow. Towards the<br>small hours of every night, Sutas and Magadhas and encomiasts utter my<br>praises even as the deities utter the agreeable praises of Indra, their<br>chief. Through the grace of thyself that art firm in truth and endued<br>with immeasurable energy, I who was before a worm have now become a<br>person of the royal order. I bow my head to thee, O thou of great wisdom.<br>Do thou command me as to what I should do now. Ordained by the puissance<br>of thy penances, even this happy status hath now become mine!'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'I have today been worshipped by thee, O king, with diverse<br>words expressive of reverence. Transformed into a worm, thy memory had<br>become clouded. That memory has again appeared. The sin thou committed in<br>a former life has not yet been destroyed,&#8212;that sin, viz., which was<br>earned by thee while thou wert a Sudra covetous of wealth and cruel in<br>behaviour and hostile to the Brahmanas. Thou wert able to obtain a sight<br>of my person. That was an act of merit to thee while thou wert a worm. In<br>consequence of thy having saluted and worshipped me thou shalt rise<br>higher, for, from the Kshatriya order thou shalt rise to the status of a<br>Brahmana, if only thou castest off thy life-breaths on the field of<br>battle for the sake of kine or Brahmanas. O prince, enjoying much<br>felicity and performing many sacrifices with copious presents, thou shalt<br>attain to heaven and transformed into eternal Brahma, thou wilt have<br>perfect beatitude. Those that take birth in the intermediate order (of<br>animals) become (when they rise) Sudras. The Sudra rises to the status of<br>the Vaisya; and the Vaisya to that of the Kshatriya. The Kshatriya who<br>takes pride in the discharge of the duties of his order, succeeds in<br>attaining to the status of a Brahmana. The Brahmana, by following a<br>righteous conduct, attains to heaven that is fraught with great<br>felicity.'"
