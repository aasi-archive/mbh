                            "The Grandsire said, 'The questions thou hast asked me in respect of<br>kine, beginning with their gift, are such that there is none else in the<br>three worlds, O thou of a hundred sacrifices, who could put them! There<br>are many kinds of regions, O Sakra, which are invisible to even thee.<br>Those regions are seen by me, O Indra, as also by those women that are<br>chaste and that have been attached to only one husband. Rishis observant<br>of excellent vows, by means of their deeds of righteousness and piety,<br>and Brahmanas of righteous souls, succeed in repairing to them in even<br>their fleshy forms. Men that are observant of excellent vows behold those<br>regions which resemble the bright creations of dreams, aided by their<br>cleansed minds and by that (temporary) emancipation which succeeds the<br>loss of one's consciousness of body.[358] Listen, O thou of a thousand<br>eyes, to me as I tell thee what the attributes are with which those<br>regions are endued. There the very course of Time is suspended.<br>Decrepitude is not there, nor Fire which is omnipresent in the universe.<br>There the slightest evil does not occur, nor disease, nor weakness of any<br>kind. The kine that live there, O Vasava, obtain the fruition of every<br>desire which they cherish in their hearts. I have direct experience of<br>what I say unto thee. Capable of going everywhere at will and actually<br>repairing from place to place with ease, they enjoy the fruition of wish<br>after wish as it arises in their minds. Lakes and tanks and rivers and<br>forests of diverse kinds, and mansions and hills and all kinds of<br>delightful objects,&#8212;delightful, that is, to all creatures,&#8212;are to be<br>seen there. There is no region of felicity that is superior to any of<br>these of which I speak. All those foremost of men, O Sakra, who are<br>forgiving unto all creatures, who endure everything, who are full of<br>affection for all things, who render dutiful obedience unto their<br>preceptors, and who are free from pride and vanity, repair to those<br>regions of supreme felicity. He, who abstains from every kind of flesh,<br>who is possessed of a cleansed heart, who is endued with righteousness,<br>who worships his parents with reverence, who is endued with truthfulness<br>of speech and conduct, who attends with obedience upon the Brahmanas, who<br>is faultless in conduct, who never behaves with anger towards kine and<br>towards the Brahmanas, who is devoted to the accomplishment of every<br>duty, who serves his preceptors with reverence, who is devoted for his<br>whole life to truth and to gifts, and who is always forgiving towards all<br>transgression against himself, who is mild and self-restrained, who is<br>full of reverence for the deities, who is hospitable to all guests, who<br>is endued with compassion,&#8212;verily, he, who is adorned with these<br>attributes,&#8212;succeeds in attaining to the eternal and immutable region of<br>kine. He, who is stained with adultery, sees not such a region; nor he,<br>who is a slayer of his preceptor; nor he, who speaks falsely or indulges<br>in idle boasts; nor he, who always disputes with others; nor he who<br>behaves with hostility towards the Brahmanas. Indeed, that wicked wight,<br>who is stained with such faults fails to attain even a sight of these<br>regions of felicity; also he that injures his friends; also he that is<br>full of guile; also he that is ungrateful; also he that is a cheat; also<br>he that is crooked in conduct; also he that is a disregarder of religion;<br>also he that is a slayer of Brahmanas. Such men are incapable of<br>beholding in even imagination the region of kine that is the abode of<br>only those who are righteous of deeds. I have told thee everything about<br>the region of kine in minute detail, O chief of the deities! Hear now, O<br>thou of a hundred sacrifices, the merit that is theirs who are engaged in<br>making gifts of kine. He, who make gifts of kine, after purchasing them<br>with wealth obtained by inheritance or acquired lawfully by him, attains,<br>as the fruit of such an act to many regions of inexhaustible felicity.<br>He, who makes a gift of a cow, having acquired it with wealth won at<br>dice, enjoys felicity, O Sakra, for ten thousand years of celestial<br>measure, He, who acquires a cow as his share of ancestral wealth is said<br>to acquire her legitimately. Such a cow may be given away. They that make<br>gifts of kine so acquired obtain many eternal regions of felicity that is<br>inexhaustible. That person, who, having acquired a cow in gift makes a<br>gift of her with a pure heart, succeeds without doubt, O lord of Sachi,<br>in obtaining eternal regions of beatitude. That person, who, with<br>restrained senses speaks the truth from his birth (to the time of his<br>death) and who endures everything at the hands of his preceptor and of<br>the Brahmanas, and who practises forgiveness, succeeds in attaining to an<br>end that is equal to that of kine. That speech which is improper, O lord<br>of Sachi, should, never be addressed to a Brahmana. One, again, should<br>not, in even one's mind, do an injury to a cow. One should, in one's<br>conduct, imitate the cow, and show compassion towards the cow.[359] Hear,<br>O Sakra, what the fruits are that become his, who is devoted to the duty<br>of truth. If such a person gives away a single cow, that one cow becomes<br>equal to a thousand kine. If a Kshatriya, possessed of such<br>qualifications, makes a gift of a single cow, his merit becomes equal to<br>that of a Brahmana's. That single cow, listen, O Sakra which such a<br>Kshatriya gives away becomes the source of as much merit as the single<br>cow that a Brahmana gives away under similar circumstances. Even this is<br>the certain conclusion of the scriptures. If a Vaisya, possessed of<br>similar accomplishments, were to make a gift of a single cow, that cow<br>would be equal to five hundred kine (in respect of the merit she would<br>produce) If a Sudra endued with humility were to make a gift of a cow,<br>such a cow would be equal to a hundred and twenty-five kine (in respect<br>of the merit it would produce) Devoted to penances and truth, proficient<br>(in the scriptures and all acts) through dutiful services rendered to his<br>preceptor, endued with forgiveness of disposition, engaged in the worship<br>of the deities, possessed of a tranquil soul, pure (in body and mind),<br>enlightened, observant of all duties, and freed from every kind of<br>egotism, that man who makes a gift of a cow unto a Brahmana, certainly<br>attains to great merit through that act of his, viz., the gift, according<br>to proper rites, of a cow yielding copious milk. Hence, one, with<br>singleness of devotion, observant of truth and engaged in humbly serving<br>one's preceptor, should always make gifts of kine.[360] Hear, O Sakra,<br>what the merit is of that person, who, duly studying the Vedas, shows<br>reverence for kine, who always becomes glad at sight of kine, and who,<br>since his birth has always bowed his head unto kine. The merit that<br>becomes one's by performing the Rajasuya sacrifice, the merit that<br>becomes one's by making gifts of heaps of gold, that high merit is<br>acquired by a person who shows such reverence for kine. Righteous Rishis<br>and high-souled persons crowned with success have said so. Devoted to<br>truth, possessed of a tranquil soul, free from cupidity, always truthful<br>in speech, and behaving with reverence towards kine with the steadiness<br>of a vow, the man, who, for a whole year before himself taking any food,<br>regularly presents some food to kine, wins the merit, by such an act, of<br>the gift of a thousand kine. That man, who takes only one meal a day and<br>who gives away the entire quantity of his other meal unto kine.&#8212;verily,<br>that man, who thus reverences kine with the steadiness of a vow and shows<br>such compassion towards them,&#8212;enjoys for ten years' unlimited felicity.<br>That man, who confines himself to only one meal a day and 'with the other<br>meal saved for some time purchases a cow and makes a gift of it (unto a<br>Brahmana), earns, through that gift, O thou of a hundred sacrifices, the<br>eternal merit that attaches to the gift of as many kine as there are<br>hairs on the body of that single cow so given away. These are<br>declarations in respect of the merit that Brahmanas acquire by making<br>gifts of kine. Listen now to the merits that Kshatriyas may win. It has<br>been said that a Kshatriya, by purchasing a cow in this manner and making<br>a gift of it unto a Brahmana, acquires great felicity for five years. A<br>Vaisya, by such conduct, acquires only half the merit of a Kshatriya, and<br>a Sudra, by such conduct, earns half the merit that a Vaisya does. That<br>man, who sells himself and with the proceeds thereof purchases kine and<br>gives them away unto Brahmanas, enjoy felicity in heaven for as long a<br>period as kine are seen on earth. It has been said, O highly blessed one,<br>that in every hair of such kite as are purchased with the proceeds<br>obtained by selling oneself, there is a region of inexhaustible felicity.<br>That man, who having acquired kine by battle makes gifts of them (unto<br>Brahmanas), acquires as much merit as he, who makes gifts of kine after<br>having purchased the same with the proceeds of selling oneself. That man,<br>who, in the absence of kine, makes a gift of a cow made of sesame seeds,<br>restraining his senses the while, is rescued by such a cow from every<br>kind of calamity or distress. Such a man sports in great felicity. The<br>mere gift of kine is not fraught with merit. The considerations of<br>deserving recipients, of time, of the kind of kine, and of the ritual to<br>be observed, should be attended to. One should ascertain the proper time<br>for making a gift of kine. One should also ascertain the distinctive<br>qualifications of both Brahmanas (who are to receive them) and of kine<br>themselves (which are to be given away). Kine should not be given unto<br>one in whose abode they are likely to suffer from fire or the sun. One,<br>who is rich in Vedic lore, who is of pure lineage, who is endued with a<br>tranquil soul, who is devoted to the performance of sacrifices, who fears<br>the commission of sin, who is possessed of varied knowledge, who is<br>compassionate towards kine, who is mild in behaviour, who accords<br>protection unto all that seek it of him, and who has no means of<br>sustenance assigned unto him, is regarded as a proper person for<br>receiving a gift of kine. Unto a Brahmana who has no means of sustenance,<br>unto him while he is exceedingly afflicted for want of food (in a time,<br>of famine, for example) for purposes of agriculture, for a child born in<br>consequence of Homa, for the purposes of his preceptor, for the<br>sustenance of a child born (in the ordinary course), should a cow be<br>given. Verily, the gift should be made at a proper time and in a proper<br>place[361]. Those kine, O Sakra, whose dispositions are well-known, which<br>have been acquired as honoraria for knowledge, or which have been<br>purchased in exchange for other animals (such as goats, sheep, etc.), or<br>which have been who by prowess of arms, or obtained as marriage-dower; or<br>which have been acquired by being rescued from situations of danger, or<br>which incapable of being maintained by their 'poor owner have been made<br>over for careful keep, to another's house are, for such reasons, regarded<br>as proper objects of gift. Those kine which are strong of body, which<br>have good dispositions, and which emit an agreeable fragrance, are<br>applauded in the matter of gifts. As Ganga is the foremost of all<br>streams, even so is a Kapila cow the foremost of all animals of the<br>bovine breed. Abstaining from all food and living only upon water for<br>three nights, and sleeping for the same period upon the bare earth, one<br>should make gifts of kine unto Brahmanas after having gratified them with<br>other presents. Such kine, freed from every vice should, at the same<br>time, be accompanied by healthy calves that have not been weaned. Having<br>made the gift, the giver should live for the next three days in<br>succession on food consisting only of the products of the cow.[362] By<br>giving away a cow that is of good disposition, that quietly suffers<br>herself to be milked that always brings forth living and hale calves, and<br>that does not fly away from the owner's abode, the giver enjoys felicity<br>in the next world for as many years as there are hairs on her body.<br>Similarly, by giving unto a Brahmana a bull that is capable of bearing<br>heavy burden, that is young and strong and docile, that quietly bears the<br>yoke of the plough, and that is possessed of such energy as is sufficient<br>to undergo even great labour one attains to such regions as are his who<br>gives away ten kine. That person, who rescues kine and Brahmanas (from<br>danger) in the wilderness, O Kausika, becomes himself rescued from every<br>kind of calamity. Hear what his merit is.[363] The merit such a man<br>acquires is equal to the eternal merit of a Horse-sacrifice. Such a<br>person attains to whatever end he desires at the hour of death. Many a<br>region of felicity,&#8212;in fact, whatever happiness he covets in his<br>heart,&#8212;becomes attainable to him in consequence of such an act of his.<br>Verily, such man, permitted by kine, lives honoured in every region of<br>felicity. That man, who follows kine every day in the woods himself<br>subsisting the while on grass and cowdung and leaves of trees, his heart<br>freed from desire of fruit, his senses restrained from every improper<br>object and his mind purified of all dross,&#8212;that man,&#8212;O thou of a<br>hundred sacrifices, lives in joy and freed from the dominion of desire in<br>my region or in any other region of happiness that he wishes, in the<br>company of the deities!"
