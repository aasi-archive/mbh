                            "Vaisampayana said, 'King Yudhishthira endued with humility, once again<br>questioned the royal son of Santanu on the subject of gifts of kine in<br>detail.'<br><br>"The king said, 'Do thou, O Bharata, once more discourse to me in detail<br>on the merits of giving away kine. Verily, O hero, I have not been<br>satiated with hearing thy nectar-like words!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by king Yudhishthira the just,<br>Santanu's son began to discourse to him once again, in detail on the<br>merits attaching to the gift of kine.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'By giving unto a Brahmana a cow possessed of a calf,<br>endued with docility and other virtues, young in years, and wrapped round<br>with a piece of cloth, one becomes cleansed of all one's sins. There are<br>many regions (in Hell) which are sunless. One who makes the gift of a cow<br>has not to go thither. That man, however, who gives unto a Brahmana a cow<br>that is incapable of drinking or eating, that has her milk dried up, that<br>is endued with senses all of which have been weakened, and that is<br>diseased and overcome with decrepitude, and that may, therefore, be<br>likened to a tank whose water has been dried up,&#8212;indeed, the man who<br>gives such a cow unto a Brahmana and thereby inflicts only pain and<br>disappointment upon him, has certainly to enter into dark Hell. That cow<br>which is wrathful and vicious, or diseased, or weak or which has been<br>purchased without the price agreed upon having been paid,&#8212;or which would<br>only afflict the regenerate recipient with distress and disappointment,<br>should never be given. The regions such a man may acquire (as the rewards<br>of other acts of righteousness performed by him) would fail to give him<br>any happiness or impart to him any energy. Only such kine as are strong,<br>endued with good behaviour, young in years, and possessed of fragrance,<br>are applauded by all (in the matter of gift). Verily, as Ganga is the<br>foremost of all rivers, even so is a Kapila cow the foremost of all kine.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Why, O grandsire, do the righteous applaud the gift<br>of a Kapila cow (as more meritorious) when all good kine that are given<br>away should be regarded as equal? O thou of great puissance, I wish to<br>hear what the distinction is that attaches to a Kapila cow. Thou art,<br>verily, competent to discourse to me on this topic!'[371]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I have, O son, heard old men recite this history<br>respecting the circumstances under which the Kapila cow was created. I<br>shall recite that old history to thee! In days of yore, the Self-born<br>Brahman commanded the Rishi Daksha, saying,&#8212;Do thou create living<br>creatures! From desire of doing good to creatures, Daksha, in the first<br>instance, created food. Even as the deities exist, depending upon nectar,<br>all living creatures, O puissant one, live depending upon the sustenance<br>assigned by Daksha. Among all objects mobile and immobile, the mobile are<br>superior. Among mobile creatures Brahmanas are superior. The sacrifices<br>are all established upon them. It is by sacrifice that Soma (nectar) is<br>got. Sacrifice has been established upon kine.[372] The gods become<br>gratified through sacrifices. As regards the Creation then, the means of<br>support came first, creatures came next. As soon as creatures were born,<br>they began to cry aloud for food. All of them then approached their<br>creator who was to give them food like children approaching their father<br>or mother. Knowing the intention which moved all his creatures, the holy<br>lord of all creatures, viz., Daksha, for the sake of the beings he had<br>created, himself drank a quantity of nectar. He became gratified with the<br>nectar he quaffed and thereupon an eructation came out, diffusing an<br>excellent perfume all around. As the result of that eructation. Daksha<br>saw that it gave birth to a cow which he named Surabhi. This Surabhi was<br>thus a daughter of his, that had sprung from his mouth. The cow called<br>Surabhi brought forth a number of daughters who came to be regarded as<br>the mothers of the world. Their complexion was like that of gold, and<br>they were all Kapilas. They were the means of sustenance for all<br>creatures. As those kine, whose complexion resembled that of Amrita,<br>began to pour milk, the froth of that milk arose and began to spread on<br>every side, even as when the waves of a running stream dashing against<br>one another, copious froth is produced that spreads on every side. Some<br>of that froth fell, from the mouths of the calves that were sucking, upon<br>the head of Mahadeva who was then sitting on the Earth. The puissant<br>Mahadeva thereupon, filled with wrath, cast his eyes upon those kine.<br>With that third eye of his which adorns his forehead, he seemed to burn<br>those kine as he looked at them. Like the Sun tingeing masses of clouds<br>with diverse colours the energy that issued from the third eye of<br>Mahadeva produced, O monarch, diverse complexion in those kine. Those<br>amongst them, however, which succeeded in escaping from the glance of<br>Mahadeva by entering the region of Soma, remained of the same colour with<br>which they were born, for no change was produced in their complexion.<br>Seeing that Mahadeva had become exceedingly angry; Daksha, the lord of<br>all creatures, addressed him, saying&#8212;Thou hast, O great deity, been<br>drenched with nectar. The milk or the froth that escapes from the mouths<br>of calves sucking their dams is never regarded as impure remnant.[373]<br>Chandramas, after drinking the nectar, pours it once more. It is not,<br>however, on that account, looked upon as impure. After the same manner,<br>the milk that these kine yield, being born of nectar, should not be<br>regarded as impure (even though the udders have been touched by the<br>calves with their mouths). The wind can never become impure. Fire can<br>never become impure. Gold can never become impure. The Ocean can never<br>become impure. The Nectar, even when drunk by the deities, can never<br>become impure. Similarly, the milk of a cow, even when her udders are<br>sucked by her calf, can never become impure. These kine will support all<br>these worlds with the milk they will yield and the ghee that will be<br>manufactured therefrom. All creatures wish to enjoy the auspicious<br>wealth, identifiable with nectar, that kine possess!&#8212;Having said these<br>words, the lord of creatures, Daksha, made a present unto Mahadeva of a<br>bull with certain kine. Daksha gratified the heart of Rudra, O Bharata,<br>with that present, Mahadeva, thus gratified, made that bull his vehicle.<br>And it was after the form of that bull that Mahadeva adopted the device<br>on the standard floating on his battle-car. For this reason it is that<br>Rudra came to be known as the bull-bannered deity. It was on that<br>occasion also that the celestials, uniting together, made Mahadeva the<br>lord of animals. Indeed, the great Rudra became the Master of kine and is<br>named as the bull-signed deity. Hence, O king, in the matter of giving<br>away kine, the gift is regarded as primarily desirable of Kapila kine<br>which are endued with great energy and possessed of colour unchanged<br>(from white). Thus are kine, the foremost of all creatures in the world.<br>It is from them that the means have flowed of the sustenance of all the<br>worlds. They have Rudra for their master. They yield Soma (nectar) in the<br>form of milk. They are auspicious and sacred, and grantors of every wish<br>and givers of life. A person by making a gift of a cow come to be<br>regarded as making a gift of every article that is desired to be enjoyed<br>by men. That man who, desiring to attain to prosperity, reads with a pure<br>heart and body these verses on the origin of kine, becomes cleansed of<br>all his sins and attains to prosperity and children and wealth and<br>animals. He who makes a gift of a cow, O king, always succeeds in<br>acquiring the merits that attach to gifts of Havya and Kavya, to the<br>offer of oblations of water unto the Pitris, to other religious acts<br>whose performance brings peace and happiness, to the gift of vehicles and<br>cloths, and to the cherishing of children and the old.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of his grandsire, Pritha's<br>son, viz., the royal Yudhishthira of Ajamida's race, uniting with his<br>brothers, began to make gifts of both bulls and kine of different colours<br>unto foremost of Brahmanas. Verily, for the purpose of subduing regions<br>of felicity in the next, and winning great fame, king Yudhishthira<br>performed many sacrifices and, as sacrificial presents, gave away<br>hundreds of thousands of kine unto such Brahmanas.'"
