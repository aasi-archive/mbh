                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Alas, those cruel men, who, discarding diverse kinds<br>of food, covet only flesh, are really like great Rakshasas! Alas, they do<br>not relish diverse kinds of cakes and diverse sorts of potherbs and<br>various species of Khanda with juicy flavour so much as they do flesh! My<br>understanding, for this reason, becomes stupefied in this matter. I<br>think, when such is the case, that, there is nothing which can compare<br>with flesh in the matter of taste, I desire, therefore, O puissant one,<br>to hear what the merits are of abstention from flesh, and the demerits<br>that attach to the eating of flesh, O chief of Bharata's race. Thou art<br>conversant with every duty. Do thou discourse to me in full agreeably to<br>the ordinances on duty, on this subject. Do tell me what, indeed, is<br>edible and what inedible. Tell me, O grandsire, what is flesh, of what<br>substances it is, the merits that attach to abstention from it, and what<br>the demerits are that attach to the eating of flesh.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'It is even so, O mighty-armed one, as thou sayest. There<br>is nothing on earth that is superior to flesh in point of taste. There is<br>nothing that is more beneficial then flesh to persons that are lean, or<br>weak, or afflicted with disease, or addicted to sexual congress or<br>exhausted with travel. Flesh speedily increases strength. It produces<br>great development. There is no food, O scorcher of foes, that is superior<br>to flesh. But, O delighter of the Kurus, the merits are great that attach<br>to men that abstain from it. Listen to me as I discourse to thee on it.<br>That man who wished to increase his own flesh by the flesh of another<br>living creature is such that there is none meaner and more cruel than he.<br>In this world there is nothing that is dearer to a creature than his<br>life. Hence (instead of taking that valuable possession), one should show<br>compassion to the lives of others as one does to one's own life. Without<br>doubt, O son, flesh has its origin in the vital seed. There is great<br>demerit attaching to its eating, as, indeed, there is merit in abstaining<br>from it. One does not, however, incur any fault by eating flesh<br>sanctified according to the ordinances of the Vedas. The audition is<br>heard that animals were created for sacrifice. They who eat flesh in any<br>other way are said to follow the Rakshasa practice. Listen to me as I<br>tell thee what the ordinance is that has been laid down for the<br>Kshatriyas. They do not incur any fault by eating flesh that has been<br>acquired by expenditure of prowess. All deer of the wilderness were<br>dedicated to the deities and the Pitris in days of old, O king, by<br>Agastya. Hence, the hunting of deer is not censured. There can be no<br>hunting without risk of one's own life. There is equality of risk between<br>the slayer and the slain. Either the animal is killed or it kills the<br>hunter. Hence, O Bharata, even royal sages betake themselves to the<br>practice of hunting. By such conduct they do not become stained with sin.<br>Indeed, the practice is not regarded as sinful. There is nothing, O<br>delighter of the Kurus, that is equal in point of merit, either here or<br>hereafter, to the practice of compassion to all living creatures. The man<br>of compassion has no fear. Those harmless men that are endued with<br>compassion have both this world and the next. Persons conversant with<br>duty say that that Religion is worthy of being called Religion which has<br>abstention from cruelty for its indication. The man of cleansed soul<br>should do only such acts as have compassion for their soul. That flesh<br>which is dedicated in sacrifices performed in honour of the deities and<br>the Pitris is called Havi (and, as such, is worthy of being eaten). That<br>man who is devoted to compassion and who behaves with compassion towards<br>others, has no fear to entertain from any creature. It is heard that all<br>creatures abstain from causing any fear unto such a creature. Whether he<br>is wounded or fallen down or prostrated or weakened or bruised, in<br>whatever state he may be, all creatures protect him. Indeed, they do so,<br>under all circumstances, whether he is on even or uneven ground. Neither<br>snakes nor wild animals, neither Pisachas nor Rakshasas, ever slay him.<br>When circumstances of fear arise, he becomes freed from fear who frees<br>others from situations of fear. There has never been, nor will there ever<br>be, a gift that is superior to the gift of life. It is certain that there<br>is nothing dearer to oneself than one's life. Death, O Bharata, is a<br>calamity or evil unto all creatures. When the time comes for Death, a<br>trembling of the whole frame is seen in all creatures. Enduring birth in<br>the uterus, decrepitude and afflictions of diverse kinds, in this ocean<br>of the world, living creatures may be seen to be continually going<br>forward and coming back. Every creature is afflicted by death. While<br>dwelling in the uterus, all creatures are cooked in the fluid juices,<br>that are alkaline and sour and bitter, of urine and phlegm and<br>faeces,&#8212;juices that produce painful sensations and are difficult to<br>bear. There in the uterus, they have to dwell in a state of helplessness<br>and are even repeatedly torn and pierced. They that are covetous of meat<br>are seen to be repeatedly cooked in the uterus in such a state of<br>helplessness. Attaining to diverse kinds of birth, they are cooked in the<br>hell called Kumbhipaka. They are assailed and slain, and in this way have<br>to travel repeatedly. There is nothing so dear to one as one's life when<br>one comes to this world. Hence, a person of cleansed soul should be<br>compassionate to all living creatures. That man, O king, who abstains<br>from every kind of meat from his birth, without doubt, acquires a large<br>space in Heaven, They who eat the flesh of animals who are desirous of<br>life, are themselves eaten by the animals they eat, without doubt. Even<br>this is my opinion. Since he hath eaten me, I shall eat him in<br>return,&#8212;even this, O Bharata, constitutes the character as Mansa of<br>Mansa.[525] The slayer is always slain. After him the eater meets with<br>the same fate. He who acts with hostility towards another (in this life)<br>becomes the victim of similar acts done by that other. Whatever acts one<br>does in whatever bodies, one has to suffer the consequences thereof in<br>those bodies.[526] Abstention from cruelty is the highest Religion.<br>Abstention from cruelty is the highest self-control. Abstention from<br>cruelty is the highest gift. Abstention from cruelty is the highest<br>penance. Abstention from cruelty is the highest sacrifice. Abstention<br>from cruelty is the highest puissance. Abstention from cruelty is the<br>highest friend. Abstention from cruelty is the highest happiness.<br>Abstention from cruelty is the highest truth. Abstention from cruelty is<br>the highest Sruti. Gifts made in all sacrifices, ablutions performed in<br>all sacred waters, and the merit that one acquires from making all kinds<br>of gifts mentioned in the scriptures,&#8212;all these do not come up to<br>abstention from cruelty (in point of the merit that attaches to it). The<br>penances of a man that abstains from cruelty are inexhaustible. The man<br>that abstains from cruelty is regarded as always performing sacrifices.<br>The man that abstains from cruelty is the father and mother of all<br>creatures. Even these, O chief of Kuru's race, are some of the merits of<br>abstention from cruelty. Altogether, the merits that attach to it are so<br>many that they are incapable of being exhausted even if one were to speak<br>for a hundred years."
