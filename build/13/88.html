                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O thou of great puissance, tell me what that object<br>is which, if dedicated to the Pitris, becomes inexhaustible! What Havi,<br>again, (if offered) lasts for all time? What, indeed, is that which (if<br>presented) becomes eternal?'"<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen to me, O Yudhishthira, what those Havis are which<br>persons conversant with the ritual of the Sraddha regard as suitable in<br>view of the Sraddha and what the fruits are that attach to each. With<br>sesame seeds and rice and barley and Masha and water and roots and<br>fruits, if given at Sraddhas, the Pitris, O king, remain gratified for<br>the period of a month.[398] Manu has said that if a Sraddha is performed<br>with a copious measure of sesame, such Sraddha becomes inexhaustible. Of<br>all kinds of food, sesame seeds are regarded as the best. With fishes<br>offered at Sraddhas, the Pitris remain gratified for a period of two<br>months. With mutton they remain gratified for three months and with the<br>flesh of the hare for four. With the flesh of the goat, O king, they<br>remain gratified for five months, with bacon for six months, and with the<br>flesh of birds for seven. With venison obtained from those deer that are<br>called Prishata, they remain gratified for eight months, and with that<br>obtained from the Ruru for nine months, and with the meat of the Gavaya<br>for ten months. With the meat of the buffalo their gratification lasts<br>for eleven months. With beef presented at the Sraddha, their<br>gratification, it is said, lasts for a full year. Payasa mixed with ghee<br>is as much acceptable to the Pitris as beef. With the meat of the<br>Vadhrinasa the gratification of the Pitris lasts for twelve years.[399]<br>The flesh of the rhinoceros, offered to the Pitris on the anniversaries<br>of the lunar days on which they died, becomes inexhaustible. The potherb<br>called Kalasaka, the petals of the Kanchana flower, and meat of the goat<br>also, thus offered, prove inexhaustible.[400] In this connection, O<br>Yudhishthira, there are some verses, originally sung by the Pitris, that<br>are sung (in the world). They were communicated to me in former days by<br>Sanatkumara.&#8212;He that has taken birth in our race should give us Payasa<br>mixed with ghee on the thirteenth day (of the dark fortnight), under the<br>constellation Magha, during the Sun's southward course. One born in our<br>race should, under the constellation Magha, as if in the observance of a<br>vow, offer the meat of goat or the petals of the Kanchana flower. One<br>should also offer us, with due rites, Payasa mixed with ghee, dedicating<br>it on a spot covered by the shadow of an elephant.&#8212;Many sons should be<br>coveted so that even one may go to Gaya (for performing the Sraddha of<br>his ancestors), where stands the banian that is celebrated over all the<br>worlds and that makes all offerings made under its branches<br>inexhaustible.[401] Even a little of water, roots, fruits, meat, and<br>rice, mixed with honey, if offered on the anniversary of the day of death<br>becomes inexhaustible.'"
