                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Hearing thy words I become stupefied, O grandsire!<br>Reflecting that the earth is now destitute of a very large number of<br>kings all of whom were possessed of great prosperity, my heart becomes<br>filled with grief. Having conquered the earth and acquired kingdoms<br>numbered by hundreds, O Bharata, I turn with grief, O Grandsire, at the<br>thought of the millions of men I have slaughtered. Alas, what will be the<br>plight of those foremost ladies who have been deprived by us of husbands<br>and sons and maternal uncles and brothers? Having slain those Kurus&#8212;our<br>kinsmen, that is, our friends and well-wishers,&#8212;we shall have to sink in<br>hell, beads (hanging) downwards. There is no doubt of this. I desire, O<br>Bharata, to address my body to severe penances. With that end in view, O<br>king, I wish to receive instructions from thee.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The high-souled Bhishma, hearing these words of<br>Yudhishthira, reflected upon them acutely with the aid of his<br>understanding, and addressed Yudhishthira in reply.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Hear what I say unto thee. It is exceedingly wonderful,<br>and constitutes a great mystery. The topic is the object that creatures<br>obtain after death as the rewards of particular acts or courses of<br>conduct they follow. One attains to Heaven by penances. By penances one<br>attains to fame. By penances, O puissant king, one attains to length of<br>life and all articles of enjoyment. By penances one attains to knowledge,<br>to science, to health and freedom from disease, beauty of person,<br>prosperity, and blessedness, O chief of Bharata's race. By penances one<br>attains to wealth. By observing the vow of taciturnity one succeeds in<br>bringing the whole world under one's sway. By making gifts one acquires<br>all kinds of enjoyable articles. By observing the right of Diksha one<br>acquires birth in a good and high family. Those that spend their lives<br>subsisting only upon fruits and roots (and avoiding cooked food) succeed<br>in obtaining kingdom and sovereignty. Those that live upon the leaves of<br>plants and trees as their food succeed in attaining to heaven. One that<br>subsists upon water only attains to heaven. By making gifts one simply<br>increases one's wealth. By serving with reverence one's preceptor one<br>acquires learning. By performing Sraddhas every day in honour of one's<br>Pitris (manes), one acquires a large number of children. By observing<br>Diksha upon potherbs and vegetables, one acquires a large number of kine.<br>Those that subsist upon grass and straw succeed in attaining to heaven.<br>By bathing thrice every day with the necessary rites one acquires a large<br>number of spouses. By drinking water alone one acquires residence in the<br>regions of Prajapati. The Brahmana, who bathes every day and recites<br>sacred Mantras in the twilights, becomes possessed of the status of<br>Daksha himself. By worshipping the deities in a wilderness or desert, one<br>acquires a kingdom or sovereignty, and by observing the vow of casting<br>off the body by a long fast, one ascends to Heaven. One possessed of the<br>wealth of penances and always passing his days in Yoga obtains good beds<br>and seats and vehicles. Casting off the body by entering a blazing fire,<br>one becomes an object of reverence in the region of Brahman. Those that<br>lie on the hard and bare ground acquire houses and beds. Those that<br>clothe themselves in rags and barks obtain good robes and ornaments. By<br>avoiding the several agreeable tastes one succeeds in acquiring great<br>prosperity. By abstaining from meat and fish, one gets long-lived<br>children. One who passes some time in that mode of life which is called<br>Udavasa, becomes the very lord of Heaven. The man who speaks the truth, O<br>best of men, succeeds in sporting happily with the deities themselves. By<br>making gifts one acquires great fame in consequence of one's high<br>achievements. By abstention from cruelty one acquires health and freedom<br>from disease. By serving Brahmanas with reverence one attains to kingdom<br>and sovereignty, and the high status of a Brahmana. By making gifts of<br>water and other drinks, one acquires eternal fame in consequence of high<br>achievements. By making gifts of food one acquires diverse articles of<br>enjoyment. One who gives peace unto all creatures (by refraining from<br>doing them any injury), becomes freed from every region. By serving the<br>deities one obtains a kingdom and celestial beauty. By presenting lights<br>at places which are dark and frequented by men, one acquires a good<br>vision. By giving away good and beautiful objects one acquires a good<br>memory and understanding. By giving away scents and garlands, one<br>acquires fame that spreads over a large area. Those who abstain from<br>shaving off their hair and beards succeed in obtaining excellent<br>children.. By observing fasts and Diksha and baths, O Bharata, for twelve<br>years (according to the ordinance), one acquires a region that is<br>superior to that attainable by unreturning heroes. By bestowing one's<br>daughter on an eligible bridegroom according to the Brahma form, one<br>obtains, O best of men, male and female slaves and ornaments and fields<br>and houses. By performing sacrifices and observing fasts, one ascends to<br>Heaven, O Bharata. The man who gives away fruits and flowers succeeds in<br>acquiring auspicious knowledge. The man who gives a thousand kine with<br>horns adorned with gold, succeeds in acquiring heaven. Even this has been<br>said by the very deities in a conclave in heaven. One who gives away a<br>Kapila cow with her calf, with a brazen pot of milking with horns adorned<br>with gold, and possessed of diverse other accomplishments, obtains the<br>fruition of all his wishes from that cow. Such a person, in consequence<br>of that act of gift, resides in heaven for as many years as there are<br>hairs on the body of the cow and rescues in the next world (from the<br>misery of hell) his sons and grandsons and all his race to the seventh<br>degree.[314] The regions of the Vasus become attainable to that man who<br>gives away a cow with horns beautifully decorated with gold, accompanied<br>with a brazen jar for milking, along with a piece of cloth embroidered<br>with gold, a measure of sesame and a sum of money as Dakshina. A gift of<br>kine rescues the giver in the next world then he finds himself falling<br>into the deep darkness of hell and restrained by his own acts in this<br>world, like a boat with sails that have caught the air rescuing a person<br>from being drowned in the sea. He who bestows a daughter according to the<br>Brahma form upon an eligible person, or who makes a gift of land unto a<br>Brahmana, or who gives food (to a Brahmana) according to due rites,<br>succeeds in attaining to the region of Purandara. That man who makes a<br>gift of a house, equipped with every kind of furniture, unto a Brahmana<br>given to Vedic studies and possessed of every accomplishment and good<br>behaviour, acquires residence in the country of the Uttara-Kurus. By<br>making gifts of draft bullocks, a person acquires the region of the<br>Vasus. Gifts of gold lead to heaven. Gifts of pure gold lead to greater<br>merit still. By making a gift of an umbrella one acquires a palatial<br>mansion. By making a gift of a pair of sandals or shoes one acquires good<br>vehicles. The reward attached to a gift of cloths is personal beauty, and<br>by making gifts of scents one becomes a fragrant person in one's next<br>life. One who gives flowers and fruits and plants and trees unto a<br>Brahmana, acquires, without any labour, palatial mansion equipped with<br>beautiful women and full of plenty of wealth. The giver of food and drink<br>of different tastes and of other articles of enjoyment succeeds in<br>acquiring a copious supply of such articles. The giver, again, of houses<br>and cloths gets articles of a similar kind. There is no doubt about it.<br>That person who makes gifts of garlands and incense and scents and<br>unguents and the articles needed by men after a bath, and floral wreaths,<br>unto Brahmanas, becomes freed from every disease and possessed of<br>personal beauty, sports in joy in the region reserved for great kings.<br>The man, O king, who makes unto a Brahmana the gift of a house that is<br>stored with grain, furnished with beds full of much wealth, auspicious,<br>and delightful, acquires a palatial residence. He who gives unto a<br>Brahmana a good bed perfumed with fragrant scents, overlaid with an<br>excellent sheet, and equipped with pillows, wins without any effort on<br>his part a beautiful wife, belonging to a high family and of agreeable<br>manners. The man who takes to a hero's bed on the field of battle becomes<br>the equal of the Grandsire Brahman himself. There is no end higher than<br>this. Even this is what the great Rishis have declared.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of his grandfather,<br>Yudhishthira, the delighter of the Kurus, became desirous of the end that<br>is reserved for heroes and no longer expressed any disgust at leading a<br>householder's mode of life. Then, O foremost of men, Yudhishthira,<br>addressing all the other sons of Pandu, said unto them, 'Let the words<br>which our grandfather has said command your faith.' At this, all the<br>Pandavas with the famous Draupadi amongst them, applauded the words of<br>Yudhishthira and said, 'Yes'.'"
