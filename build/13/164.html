                            "Bhishma said, 'If one does acts oneself that are good or causes others<br>to accomplish them, one should then expect to attain to the merits of<br>righteousness. Similarly, if one does acts oneself that are evil, and<br>causes others to accomplish them, one should never expect to attain to<br>the merits of righteousness.[628] At all times, it is Time that, entering<br>the understandings of all creatures, sets them to acts of righteousness<br>or unrighteousness, and then confer felicity or misery upon them. When a<br>person, beholding the fruits of Righteousness, understands Righteousness<br>to be superior, it is then that he inclines towards Righteousness and<br>puts faith in it. One, however, whose understanding is not firm, fails to<br>put faith in it, As regards faith in Righteousness, it is this (and<br>nothing else). To put faith in Righteousness is the indication of the<br>wisdom of all persons. One that is acquainted with both (i.e., what<br>should be done and what should not be done), with a view to<br>opportuneness, should, with care and devotion, achieve what is right.<br>Those Righteous men who have in this life been blessed with affluence,<br>acting of their own motion, take particular care of their souls so that<br>they may not, in their next lives, have to take birth as persons with the<br>attribute of Passion predominating in them. Time (which is the supreme<br>disposer of all things) can never make Righteousness the cause of misery.<br>One should, therefore, know that the soul which is righteous is certainly<br>pure (i.e., freed from the element of evil and misery). As regards<br>Unrighteousness, it may be said that, even when of large proportions, it<br>is incapable of even touching Righteousness which is always protected by<br>Time and which shines like a blazing fire. These are the two results<br>achieved by Righteousness, viz., the stainlessness of the soul and<br>unsusceptibility of being touched by Unrighteousness. Verily,<br>Righteousness is fraught with victory. Its effulgence is so great that it<br>illumines the three worlds. A man of wisdom cannot catch hold of a sinful<br>person and forcibly cause him to become righteous. When seriously urged<br>to act righteously, the sinful only act with hypocrisy, impelled by fear.<br>They that are righteous among the Sudras never betake themselves to such<br>hypocrisy under the plea that persons of the Sudra order are not<br>permitted to live according to any of the four prescribed modes. I shall<br>tell thee particularly what the duties truly are of the four orders. So<br>far as their bodies are concerned, the individuals belonging to all the<br>four orders have the five primal elements for the constituent<br>ingredients. Indeed, in this respect, they are all of the same substance.<br>For all that, distinctions exist between them in respect of both<br>practices relating to life or the world and the duties of righteousness.<br>Notwithstanding these distinctions, sufficient liberty of action is left<br>to them in consequence of which all individuals may attain to an equality<br>of condition. The regions of felicity which represent the consequences or<br>rewards of Righteousness are not eternal, for they are destined to come<br>to an end. Righteousness, however, is eternal. When the cause is eternal,<br>why is the effect not so?[629] The answer to this is as follows. Only<br>that Righteousness is eternal which is not promoted by the desire of<br>fruit or reward. (That Righteous, however, which is prompted by the<br>desire of reward, not eternal. Hence, the reward though undesired that<br>attaches to the first kind of Righteousness, viz., attainment of identity<br>with Brahman, is eternal. The reward, however, that attaches to that<br>Righteousness prompted by desire of fruit. Heaven is not eternal).[630]<br>All men are equal in respect of their physical organism. All of them,<br>again, are possessed of souls that are equal in respect of their nature.<br>When dissolution comes, all else dissolve away. What remains is the<br>inceptive will to achieve Righteousness. That, indeed, reappears (in next<br>life) of itself.[631] When such is the result (that is, when the<br>enjoyments and endurance of this life are due to the acts of a past<br>life), the inequality of lot discernible among human beings cannot be<br>regarded in any way anomalous. So also, it is seen that those creatures<br>that belong to the intermediate orders of existence are equally subject,<br>in the matter of their acts, to the influence of example.'"
