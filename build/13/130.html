                            "Bhishma said, 'The Rishis there assembled, together with the Pitris and<br>the deities, then, with concentrated attention, questioned Arundhati (the<br>spouse of Vasishtha) who was endued with great ascetic merit. Possessed<br>of abundant wealth of penances, Arundhati was equal to her husband, the<br>high-souled Vasishtha in energy for in both vows and conduct she was her<br>husband's equal. Addressing her they said, 'We desire to hear from thee<br>the mysteries of duty and religion. It behoveth thee, O amiable lady, to<br>tell us what thou regardest as a high mystery.'<br><br>"Arundhati said, 'The great progress I have been able to achieve in<br>penances is due to your consideration for me in thus remembering my poor<br>self. With your gracious permission I shall now discourse on duties that<br>are eternal, on duties that are high mysteries. I shall discourse thereon<br>with the causes on which they depend. Listen to me as I discourse to you<br>elaborately. A knowledge of these should be imparted unto him only that<br>is possessed of faith or that has a pure heart. These four, viz., he that<br>is bereft of faith, he that is full of pride, he that is guilty of<br>Brahmanicide, and he that violates the bed of his preceptor, should never<br>be talked to. Religion and duty should never be communicated unto them.<br>The merits acquired by a person who gives away a Kapila cow every day for<br>a period of two and ten years, or by a person who adores the deities<br>every month in a sacrifice, or by him who gives away hundreds of<br>thousands of kine in the great Pushkara, do not come up to those that are<br>his with whom a guest is gratified. Listen now to another duty whose<br>observance is fraught with happiness to mankind. It should be observed<br>with its secret ritual by a person endued with faith, Its merits are<br>certainly high. Listen to what they are. If a person, rising at early<br>dawn and taking with him a quantity of water and a few blades of Kusa<br>grass, proceeds into a cow-pen and arriving there washes a cow's horns by<br>sprinkling thereon that water with those blades of Kusa grass and then<br>causes the water to drip down on his own head, he is regarded, in<br>consequence of such a bath, as one that has performed his ablutions in<br>all the sacred waters that the wise have heard to exist in the three<br>worlds and that are honoured and resorted to by Siddhas and Charanas.'<br>After Arundhati had said these words, all the deities and Pitris<br>applauded her, saying, 'Excellent, Excellent,' Indeed, all the beings<br>there were highly gratified and all of them worshipped Arundhati.'<br><br>"Brahman said, 'O highly blessed one, excellent is the duty that thou<br>hast enunciated, together with its secret ritual. Praise be to thee! I<br>grant thee this boon, viz., that thy penances will continually increase!'<br><br>"Yams said, 'I have heard from thee an excellent and agreeable discourse.<br>Listen now to what Chitragupta has said and what is agreeable to me.<br>Those words relate to duty with its secret ritual, and are worthy of<br>being heard by the great Rishis, as also by men endued with faith and<br>desirous of achieving their own good. Nothing is lost of either piety or<br>sin that is committed by creatures. On days of the full moon and the new<br>moon, those acts are conveyed to the sun where they rest. When a mortal<br>goes into the region of the dead, the deity of the sun bears witness to<br>all his acts. He that is righteous acquires the fruits of his<br>righteousness there. I shall now tell you of some auspicious duties that<br>are approved by Chitragupta. Water for drink, and lamps for lighting<br>darkness, should always be given, as also sandals and umbrellas and<br>Kapila kine with due rites. In Pushkara especially should one make the<br>gift of a Kapila cow unto a Brahmana conversant with the Vedas. One<br>should also always maintain one's Agnihotra with great care. Here is<br>another duty which was proclaimed by Chitragupta. It behoveth them that<br>are the best of creatures to listen to what the merits are of that duty<br>separately. In course of time, every creature is destined to undergo<br>dissolution. They that are of little understanding meet with great<br>distress in the regions of the dead, for they become afflicted by hunger<br>and thirst. Indeed, they have to rot there, burning in pain. There is no<br>escape for them from such calamity. They have to enter into a thick<br>darkness. I shall now tell you of those duties by performing which one<br>may succeed in crossing such calamity. The performance of those duties<br>costs very little but is fraught with great merit. Indeed, such<br>performance is productive of great happiness in the other world. The<br>merits that attach to the gift of water for drink are excellent. In the<br>next world in especial, those merits are very high. For them that make<br>gifts of water for drink there is ordained in the other world a large<br>river full of excellent water. Indeed, the water contained in that river<br>is inexhaustible and cool and sweet as nectar. He who makes gifts of<br>water in this world drinks from that stream in the world hereafter when<br>he goes thither. Listen now to the abundant merits that attach to the<br>giving of lamps. The man who gives lamps in this world has never to even<br>behold the thick darkness (of Hell). Soma and Surya and the deity of fire<br>always give him their light when he repairs to the other world. The<br>deities ordain that on every side of such a person there should be<br>blazing light. Verily, when the giver of lights repairs to the world of<br>the dead, he himself blazes forth in pure effulgence like a second Surya.<br>Hence, one should give lights while here and water for drink in especial.<br>Listen now to what the merits are of the person who makes the gift of a<br>Kapila cow to a Brahmana conversant with the Vedas, especially if the<br>gift be made in Pushkara. Such a man is regarded as having made a gift of<br>a hundred kine with a bull, a gift that is productive of eternal merit.<br>The gift of a single Kapila cow is capable of cleansing whatever sins the<br>giver may be guilty of even if those sins be as grave. Brahmanicide, for<br>the gift of a single Kapila cow is regarded as equal in point of merit to<br>that of a hundred kine. Hence, one should give away a Kapila cow at that<br>Pushkara which is regarded as the senior (of the two Tirthas known by<br>that name) on the day of the full moon in the month of Karttika. Men that<br>succeed in making such a gift have never to encounter distress of any<br>kind, or sorrow, or thorns giving pain. That man who gives away a pair of<br>sandals unto a superior Brahmana that is deserving of the gift, attains<br>to similar merits. By giving away an umbrella a person obtains<br>comfortable shade in the next world. (He will not have to be exposed to<br>the sun). A gift made to a deserving person is never lost. It is certain<br>to produce agreeable consequences to the giver.' Hearing these opinions<br>of Chitragupta, Surya's hairs stood on their ends. Endued with great<br>splendour, he addressed all the deities and the Pitris, saying 'Ye have<br>heard the mysteries relating to duty, as propounded by the high-souled<br>Chitragupta. Those human beings who, endued with faith, make these gifts<br>unto high-souled Brahmanas, become freed from fear of every kind. These<br>five kinds of men, stained with vicious deeds, have no escape. Verily, of<br>sinful behaviour and regarded as the worst of men, they should never be<br>talked to. Indeed they should always be avoided. Those five are he who is<br>the slayer of a Brahmana, he who is the slayer of a cow, he who is<br>addicted to sexual congress with other people's wives, he who is bereft<br>of faith (in the Vedas), and he who derives his sustenance by selling the<br>virtue of his wife. These men of sinful conduct, when they repair to the<br>region of the dead, rot in hell like worms that live upon pus and blood.<br>These five are avoided by the Pitris, the deities, the Snataka Brahmanas,<br>and other regenerate persons that are devoted to the practice of<br>penances.'"
