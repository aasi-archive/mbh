                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O chief of Bharata's rare, by whom was the custom of<br>giving umbrellas and sandals at obsequial ceremonies introduced? Why was<br>it introduced and for what purpose are those gifts made? They are given<br>not only at obsequial ceremonies but also at other religious rites. They<br>are given on many occasions with a view to acquiring religious merit. I<br>wish to know, in detail, O regenerate one, the true meaning of this<br>custom!'"<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Do thou, O prince, attentively listen to the details I<br>shall recite in respect of the custom of giving away umbrellas and shoes<br>at religious rites, and as to how and by whom it was introduced. I shall<br>also tell thee in full, O prince, how it acquired the force of a<br>permanent observance and how it came to be viewed as a meritorious act. I<br>shall, in this connection, recite the narrative of the discourse between<br>Jamadagni and the high-souled Surya. In ancient times, the illustrious<br>Jamadagni, O puissant king, of Bhrigu's race, was engaged in practising<br>with his bow. Taking his aim, he shot arrow after arrow. His wife Renuka<br>used to pick up the shafts when shot and repeatedly bring them back to<br>that descendant, endued with blazing energy, of Bhrigu's race. Pleased<br>with the whizzing noise of his arrows and the twang of his bow, he amused<br>himself thus by repeatedly discharging his arrows which Renuka brought<br>back into him. One day, at noontide, O monarch, in that month when the<br>sun was in Jyesthamula, the Brahmana, having discharged all his arrows,<br>said to Renuka, 'O large-eyed lady, go and fetch me the shafts I have<br>shot from my bow, O thou of beautiful eye-brows! I shall again shoot them<br>with my bow.' The lady proceeded on her errand but was compelled to sit<br>under the shade of a tree, in consequence of her head and feet being<br>scorched by the heat of the sun. The black-eyed and graceful Renuka,<br>having rested for only a moment, feared the curse of her husband and,<br>therefore, addressed herself again to the task of collecting and bringing<br>back the arrows. Taking them with her, the celebrated lady of graceful<br>features came back, distressed in mind and her feet smarting with pain.<br>Trembling with fear, she approached her husband. The Rishi, filled with<br>wrath, repeatedly addressed his fair-faced spouse, saying, 'O Renuka, why<br>hast thou teen so late in returning?'"<br><br>"Renuka said, 'O thou that art endued with wealth of penances, my head<br>and feet were scorched by the rays of the sun! Oppressed by the heat, I<br>had betaken myself to the shade of a tree! Just this has been the cause<br>of the delay! Informed of the cause, do thou, O lord, cease to be angry<br>with me!'"<br><br>"Jamadagni said, 'O Renuka, this very day shall I destroy, with the fiery<br>energy of my weapons, the star of day with his blazing rays, that has<br>afflicted thee in this way!'"<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Drawing his celestial bow, and taking up many<br>arrows, Jamadagni stood, turning his face towards the sun and watching<br>him as he moved (in his diurnal course). Then, O son of Kunti, beholding<br>him addressed for fight, Surya approached him in the guise of a Brahmana,<br>and said unto him. 'What has Surya done to displease thee? Coursing<br>through the firmament, he draws up the moisture from the earth, and in<br>the form of rains he pours it down once more on her. It is through this,<br>O regenerate one, that the food of human beings springs up,&#8212;food that is<br>so agreeable to them! The Vedas say that it is food that constitutes the<br>life-breaths. O Brahmana, hidden in the clouds and encompassed by his<br>rays, the sun drenches the seven islands with showers of rain. O puissant<br>one, the moisture, thus poured, diffusing itself into the leaves and<br>fruits of vegetables and herbs, is transformed into food. O son of<br>Bhrigu, the rites of nativity, religious observances of every kind,<br>investiture with the sacred thread, gifts of kine, weddings, all articles<br>in view of sacrifices, the rules for the governance of men, gifts, all<br>sorts of union (between man and man), and the acquisition of wealth, have<br>their origin in food! Thou knowest this well! All the good and agreeable<br>things in the universe, and all the efforts made by living creatures,<br>flow from food. I duly recite what is well-known to thee! Indeed, thou<br>fully knowest all that I have said! Do thou, therefore, O regenerate<br>Rishi, appease thy anger! What wilt thou gain by annihilating the sun?'"
