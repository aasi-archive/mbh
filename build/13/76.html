                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I desire, O king, to hear thee discourse in detail<br>upon those high ordinances which regulate gifts of kine, for it is by<br>making gifts (of kine) according to those ordinances that one attains to<br>innumerable regions of eternal felicity.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'There is no gift, O lord of Earth, that is higher in<br>point of merit than the gift of kine. A cow, lawfully acquired, if given<br>away, immediately rescues the whole race of the giver. That ritual which<br>sprang for the benefit of the righteous, was subsequently declared for<br>the sake of all creatures. That ritual has come down from primeval time.<br>It existed even before it was declared. Verily, O king, listen to me as I<br>recite to thee that ritual which affects the gift of kine.[366] In days<br>of yore when a number of kine (intended to be given away) was brought<br>(before him), king Mandhatri, filled with doubt in respect of the ritual<br>he should observe (in actually giving them away), properly questioned<br>Vrihaspati (the preceptor of the celestials) for an explanation of that<br>doubt. Vrihaspati said, 'Duly observing restraints the while, the giver<br>of kine should, on the previous day, properly honour the Brahmanas and<br>appoint the (actual) time of gift. As regards the kine to be given away,<br>they should be of the class called Rohini. The kine also should be<br>addressed with the words&#8212;Samange and Vahule&#8212;Entering the fold where the<br>kine are kept, the following Srutis should be uttered,&#8212;The cow is my<br>mother. The bull is my sire. (Give me) heaven and earthly prosperity! The<br>cow is my refuge!&#8212;Entering the fold and acting in this way, the giver<br>should pass the night there.' He should again utter the formula when<br>actually giving away the kine.[367] The giver, thus residing with the<br>kine in the fold without doing anything to restrain their freedom, and<br>lying down on the bare earth (without driving away the gnats and other<br>insects that would annoy him as they annoy the kine), becomes immediately<br>cleansed of all his sins in consequence of his reducing himself to a<br>state of perfect similitude with the kine. When the sun rises in the<br>morning, thou shouldst give away the cow, accompanied by her calf and a<br>bull. As the reward of such an act, heaven will certainly become<br>attainable to thee. The blessings also that are indicated by the Mantras<br>will also be thine. The Mantras contain these references to kine: Kine<br>are endued with the elements of strength and energetic exertion. Kine<br>have in them the elements of wisdom. They are the source of that<br>immortality which sacrifice achieves. They are the refuge of all energy.<br>They are the steps by which earthly prosperity is won. They constitute<br>the eternal course of the universe. They lead to the extension of one's<br>race. Let the kine (I give away) destroy my sins. They have that in them<br>which partakes in the nature of both Surya, and Soma. Let them be aids to<br>my attainment of heaven. Let them betake themselves to me as a mother<br>takes to her offspring. Let all other blessings also be mine that have<br>not been named in the Mantras I have uttered! In the alleviation or cure<br>of phthisis and other wasting diseases, and in the matter of achieving<br>freedom from the body, if a person takes the help of the five products of<br>the cow, kine become inclined to confer blessings upon the person like<br>the river Saraswati&#8212;Ye kine, ye are always conveyers of all kinds of<br>merit! Gratified with me, do ye appoint a desirable end for me! I have<br>today become what ye are! By giving you away, I really give myself away.<br>(After these words have been uttered by giver, the receiver should<br>say),&#8212;Ye are no longer owned by him who gives you away! Ye have now<br>become mine. Possessed of the nature of both Sutya and Soma, do ye cause<br>both the giver and the receiver to blaze forth with all kinds of<br>prosperity!&#8212;(As already indicated), the giver should duly utter the<br>words occurring in the first part of the above verse. The regenerate<br>recipient, conversant with the ritual that regulates the gift of kine,<br>should, when receiving the kine in gift, utter (as already) said the<br>words occurring in the latter half of the above verse. The man who,<br>instead of a cow, gives away the usual value thereof or cloths or gold,<br>comes to be regarded as the giver of a cow The giver, when giving away<br>the usual value of a cow (as the substitute of a cow) should utter the<br>words,&#8212;This cow with face upturned is being given away. Do thou accept<br>her!&#8212;The man who gives away cloths (as the substitute of a cow) should<br>utter the words,&#8212;Bhavitavya&#8212;(meaning that the gift should be regarded<br>as representing a cow). The man who gives away gold (as the substitute of<br>a cow) should utter the word,&#8212;Vaishnavi (meaning, this gold that I give<br>away is of the form and nature of a cow).&#8212;Even these are the words that<br>should be uttered in the order of the kind of gift mentioned above. The<br>reward that is reaped by making such vicarious gifts of kine is residence<br>in Heaven for six and thirty thousand years, eight thousand years, and<br>twenty thousand years respectively. Even these are the merits,<br>respectively, of gifts of things as substitute of kine. While as regards<br>him who gives an actual cow all the merits that attach to vicarious gifts<br>of kine become his at only the eight step (homewards) of the<br>recipient.[368] He that gives an actual cow becomes endued with righteous<br>behaviour in this world. He that gives the value of a cow becomes freed<br>from every kind of fear. He that gives a cow (as a substitute in way for<br>a real cow) never meet with sorrow. All the three, as also they that<br>regularly go through their ablutions and other acts at early dawn, and he<br>that is well-conversant with the Mahabharata, it is well-known, attain to<br>the regions of Vishnu and Soma. Having given away a cow, the giver<br>should, for three nights, adopt the vaccine vow, and pass one night with<br>kine. Commencing again from that lunation, numbering the eight, which is<br>known by the name of Kamya, he should pass three nights, supporting<br>himself entirely on milk and urine and dung of the cow.[369] By giving<br>away a bull, one attains to the merit that attaches to the divine vow<br>(Brahmacharya). By giving away a couple of kine, one acquires the mastery<br>of the Vedas. That man who performs a sacrifice and makes gifts of kine<br>agreeably to the ritual laid down, attains to many regions of a superior<br>character. These, however, are not attainable by the person who is<br>unacquainted with that ritual (and who, therefore, gives away kine<br>without observing the scriptural declarations). That man who gives away<br>even a single cow that yields a copious measure of milk, acquires the<br>merit of giving away all desirable things on Earth collected together.<br>What need, therefore, be said of the gift of many such kine as yield<br>Havya and Kavya in consequence of their full udders? The merit that<br>attaches to the gift of superior oxen is greater than that which attaches<br>to the gift of kine. One should not, by imparting a knowledge of this<br>ritual, benefit a person that is not one's disciple or that is not<br>observant of vows or that is bereft of faith or that is possessed of a<br>crooked understanding. Verily, this religion is a mystery, unknown to<br>most people. One that knows it should not speak of it at every place.<br>There are, in the world, many men that are bereft of faith. There are<br>among men many persons that are mean and that resemble Rakshasas. This<br>religion, if imparted unto them, would lead to evil. It would be<br>productive of equal evil if imparted to such sinful men as have taken<br>shelter in atheism.&#8212;Listen to me, O king, as I recite to thee the names<br>of those righteous monarchs that have attained to regions of great<br>felicity as the reward of those gifts of kine which they made agreeable<br>to the instructions of Vrihaspati, Usinara, Viswagaswa, Nriga,<br>Bhagiratha, the celebrated Mandhatri the son of Yuvanaswa, king<br>Muchukunda, Bhagiratha, Naishadha. Somaka, Pururavas, Bharata of imperial<br>sway to whose race belongs all the Bharatas, the heroic Rama the son of<br>Dasaratha, and many other celebrated kings of great achievement, and also<br>king Dilipa of widely known deeds, all, in consequence of their gifts of<br>kine agreeable to the ritual, attained to Heaven. King Mandhatri was<br>always observant of sacrifices, gifts, penances, kingly duties, and gifts<br>of kine. Therefore, O son of Pritha, do thou also bear in mind those<br>instructions of Vrihaspati which I have recited unto thee (in respect of<br>gifts of kine). Having obtained the kingdom of the Kurus, do thou, with a<br>cheerful heart, make gifts of good kine unto foremost of Brahmanas!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by Bhishma on the subject of<br>properly making gifts of kine, king Yudhishthira did all that Bhishma<br>wished. Verily, king Yudhishthira bore in mind the whole of that religion<br>which the preceptor of the deities imparted unto the royal Mandhatri.<br>Yudhishthira from that time began to make always gifts of kine and to<br>support himself on grains of barley and on cowdung as both his food and<br>drink. The king also began to sleep from that day on the bare earth, and<br>possessed of restrained soul and resembling a bull in conduct, he became<br>the foremost of monarchs.[370] The Kuru king from that day became very<br>attentive to kine and always worshipped them, hymning their praises. From<br>that day, the king gave up the practice of yoking kine unto his vehicles.<br>Wheresoever he had occasion to go, he proceeded on cars drawn by horses<br>of good mettle.'"
