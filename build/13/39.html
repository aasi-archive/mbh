                            "Yudhishthira said, 'All men, O king, in this world, are seen to attach<br>themselves to women, overcome by the illusion that is created by the<br>divine Being. Similarly, women too are seen to attach themselves to men.<br>All this is seen taking place everywhere in the world. On this subject a<br>doubt exists in my mind. Why, O delighter of the Kurus, do men (when<br>women are stained with so many faults) still attach themselves to women?<br>Who, again, are those men with whom women are highly pleased and who are<br>they with whom they are displeased? It behoveth thee, O chief of men, to<br>explain to me how men are capable of protecting women? While men take<br>pleasure in women and sport with them, women, it seems, are engaged in<br>deceiving men. Then, again, if a man once falls into their hands, it is<br>difficult for him to escape from them. Like kine ever seeking pastures<br>new women seek new men one after another. That illusion which the Asura<br>Samvara possessed, that illusion which the Asura Namuchi possessed, that<br>illusion which Vali or Kumbbinasi had, the sum total thereof is possessed<br>by women. If man laughs, women laugh. If man weeps, they weep. If the<br>opportunity requires, they receive the man that is disagreeable to them<br>with agreeable words. That science of policy which the preceptor of the<br>Asuras knew, that science of policy which the preceptor of the<br>celestials, Vrihaspati, knew, cannot be regarded to be deeper or more<br>distinguished for subtility than what woman's intelligence naturally<br>brings forth. Verily how can women, therefore, be restrained by men? They<br>make a lie appear as truth, and a truth appear as a lie. They who can do<br>this,&#8212;I ask, O hero,&#8212;how can they be ruled by persons of the opposite<br>sex? It seems to me that Vrihaspati and other great thinkers, O slayer of<br>foes, evolved the science of policy from observation of the<br>understandings of women. Whether treated by men with respect or with<br>disdain, women are seen to turn the heads and agitate the hearts of<br>men.[272] Living creatures, O thou of mighty arms, are virtuous. Even<br>this is what has been heard by us. (How then, can this be consistent with<br>fact)? For treated with affection and respect or otherwise, women<br>(forming a fair portion of living creatures) are seen to deserve censure<br>for their conduct towards men.[273] This great doubt fills my mind, viz.,<br>when their behaviour is such, what man is there that can restrain them<br>within the bounds of righteousness? Do thou explain this to me, O highly<br>blessed scion of Kuru's race! It behoves thee to tell me, O chief of<br>Kuru's race, whether women are truly capable of being restrained within<br>the bonds prescribed by the scriptures or whether any one before our time<br>did really succeed in so restraining them.'"
