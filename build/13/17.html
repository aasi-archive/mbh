                            "Vasudeva said, 'Concentrating his mind, O Yudhishthira. the regenerate<br>Rishi Upamanyu, with hands joined together in reverence uttered this<br>abstract of names (applying to Mahadeva), commencing from the beginning.'<br><br>"Upamanyu said, 'I shall adore that great Deity who deserves the<br>adorations of all creatures, by uttering those names that are celebrated<br>over all the worlds,&#8212;names some of which were uttered by the Grandsire<br>Brahma, some by the Rishis, and some of which occur in the Vedas and the<br>Vedangas. Those names have been applied (unto the great Deity) by persons<br>that are eminent. Those names of him that are, again, true and fraught<br>with success and are capable of accomplishing all the purposes which the<br>utterer may have in view, have been applied unto Mahadeva by Tandi after<br>calling them from the Vedic lore with the aid of his devotion. Indeed,<br>with those names that have been uttered by many well-known persons of<br>righteousness and by ascetics conversant with all the spiritual<br>principles. I shall adore him who is the foremost, who is the first, who<br>leads to heaven, who is ready to confer benefits upon all creatures, and<br>who is auspicious. Those names have been heard everywhere in the<br>universe, having spread from the region of Brahma (where they were<br>originally invented). All of them are fraught with the element of Truth.<br>With those names I shall adore him who is Supreme Brahman, who has been<br>declared (unto the universe) by the Vedas, and who is Eternal. I shall<br>now tell thee, O chief of Yacht's race those names. Do thou hear them<br>with rapt attention. Thou art a devoted worshipper of the Supreme Deity.<br>Do thou worship the illustrious Bhava, distinguishing him above all the<br>deities. And because thou art devoted to him, I shall therefore, recite<br>those names in thy hearing. Mahadeva is Eternal Brahman. Persons endued<br>with Yoga; Yoga's achievements are unable to know in even a hundred<br>years, the glory and puissance of the great Deity in their entirety.<br>Verily, the beginning, middle or end of Mahadeva cannot be apprehended by<br>the very deities. Indeed, when the case is such, who is there O Madhava,<br>that can recite the attributes of Mahadeva in their entirety? For all<br>that, I shall through the grace of that illustrious and supreme Deity of<br>perfect wisdom, extended to me for my devotion to him, recite his<br>attributes as embodied in an abstract of few words and letters. The<br>Supreme Lord is incapable of being adored by any one if he does not grant<br>his permission to the adorer. As regards myself, it is only when I become<br>fortunate enough to receive his permission that I succeed in adoring him.<br>I shall indicate only a few names of that great Deity who is without<br>birth and without destruction, who is the original cause of the universe,<br>who is endued with the highest Soul, and whose origin is unmanifest.<br>Hear, O Krishna, a few names, that were uttered by Brahma himself, of<br>that giver of boons, that adorable deity, that puissant one who has the<br>universe for his form, and who is possessed of supreme wisdom. These<br>names that I shall recite are extracted from the ten thousand names that<br>the great Grandsire had uttered in days of yore, as ghee is extracted<br>from curds. As gold represents the essence of rocky mountains, as honey<br>represents the essence of flowers, as Manda represents the extract from<br>ghee, even so have these names been extracted from and represent the<br>essence of those ten thousand names that were uttered by Grandsire<br>Brahma. This abstract of names is capable of cleansing every sin, however<br>heinous. It possesses the same merit that is attached to the four Vedas.<br>It should be comprehended with attention by spiritual aspirants and<br>engraved on the memory. These names fraught with auspiciousness, leading<br>to advancement, destructive of Rakshasas,[88] and great cleansers should<br>be imparted to only him that is devoted to the great Lord, to him that<br>has faith, to him that believes. Unto him that has no faith, him that is<br>an unbeliever, him that has not subjugated his soul, it should never be<br>communicated. That creature, O Krishna, who cherishes malice towards the<br>illustrious Mahadeva who is the original cause of everything, who is the<br>Supreme Soul, and who is the great Lord, has certainly to go to hell with<br>all his ancestors before and all his children after him. This abstract of<br>names that I shall recite to thee is looked upon as Yoga.[89] This is<br>looked upon as the highest object of meditation. This is that which one<br>should constantly recite as Japya. This is equivalent to Knowledge. This<br>is the highest Mystery. If one, even during his last moments, recites it<br>or hears it recited unto him, one succeeds in attaining to the highest<br>end. This is holy. This is auspicious, this is fraught with every kind of<br>benefit. This is the best of all things. Brahma, the Grandsire of all the<br>universe, having in days of old composed it, assigned to it the foremost<br>place among all excellent hymns. From that time, this hymn to the<br>greatness and glory of the high-souled Mahadeva, which is held in the<br>highest esteem by all the deities, has come to be regarded as the king of<br>all hymns. This king of all hymns was first conveyed from the region of<br>Brahman to heaven, the region of the celestials. Tandi then obtained it<br>from heaven. Hence is it known as the hymn composed by Tandi. From heaven<br>Tandi brought it down on Earth. It is the most auspicious of all<br>auspicious things, and is capable of cleansing the heart from all sins<br>however heinous. O thou of mighty arms, I shall recite to thee that best<br>of all hymns. This hymn relates to him who is the Veda of the Vedas, and<br>the most ancient of all ancient objects, to him who is the energy of all<br>energies, and the penance of all penances; to him who is the most<br>tranquil of all creatures endued with tranquillity, and who is the<br>splendour of all splendours; to him who is looked upon as the most<br>restrained of all creatures that are restrained, and him who is the<br>intelligence of all creatures endued with intelligence; to him who is<br>looked upon as the deity of all deities, and the Rishi of all Rishis; to<br>him who is regarded as the sacrifice of all sacrifices and the most<br>auspicious of all things fraught with auspiciousness; to him who is the<br>Rudra of all Rudras and the effulgence of all things endued with<br>effulgence; to him who is the Yogin of all Yogins, and the cause of all<br>causes; to him from whom all the worlds start into existence, and unto<br>whom all the worlds return when they cease to exist; to him who is the<br>Soul of all existent creatures, and who is called Hara of immeasurable<br>energy. Hear me recite those thousand and eight names of the great Sarva.<br>Hearing those names, O foremost of all men, thou shalt be crowned with<br>fruition in respect of all thy wishes,&#8212;Om! thou art Immobile, thou art<br>Fixed, thou art Puissant, thou art Terrible, thou art Foremost, thou art<br>boon-giving, and thou art Superior.[90] Thou art the Soul of all<br>creatures, thou art celebrated over all creatures, thou art all things,<br>thou art the Creator of all, and thou art Bhava."[91] Thou art the bearer<br>of matted locks on thy head.

Thou art he who enhances the prosperity of thy devotees. Thou<br>art that which is incessantly undergoing changes.'<br><br>"I have thus, 'O Krishna, hymned the praises of the illustrious Deity by<br>reciting his names in the order of their importance. Who is there that<br>can hymn the praises of the lord of the universe, that great Lord of all<br>who deserves our adorations and worship and reverence, whom the very gods<br>with Brahma at their head are unable to praise and whom the Rishis also<br>fail to sing? Aided, however, by my devotion to him, and having received<br>his permission, I have praised that Lord of sacrifices, that Deity of<br>supreme puissance, that foremost of all creatures endued with<br>intelligence. By praising with these names that enhance one's<br>auspiciousness of the great lord of blessedness, a worshipper of devoted<br>soul and pure heart succeeds in attaining to his own self. These names<br>constitute a hymn that furnishes the best means of attaining to Brahman.<br>With the aid of this hymn one is sure to succeed in attaining to<br>Emancipation. Rishis and the deities all praise the highest deity by<br>uttering this hymn. Hymned by persons of restrained soul Mahadeva becomes<br>gratified with those that hymn his praises so. The illustrious deity is<br>always full of compassion towards his devotees. Endued with omnipotence,<br>he it is that gives Emancipation to those that worship him. So also, they<br>among men that are foremost, that are possessed of faith and devotion<br>hear and recite for others and utter with reverence the praises of that<br>highest and eternal Lord viz. Isana, in all their successive lives and<br>adore him in thought, word, and deed, and adoring him thus at all times,<br>viz. when they are lying or seated or walking or awake or opening the<br>eyelids or shutting them, and thinking of him repeatedly, become objects<br>of reverence with all their fellowmen and derive great gratification and<br>exceeding joy. When a creature becomes cleansed of all his sins in course<br>of millions of births in diverse orders of being, it is then that<br>devotion springs up in his heart for Mahadeva. It is through good luck<br>alone that undivided devotion to Bhava who is the original cause (of the<br>universe) fully springs up in the heart of one that is conversant with<br>every mode of worshipping that great Deity.[185] Such stainless and pure<br>devotion to Rudra, that has singleness of purpose and that is simply<br>irresistible in its course, is seldom to be found among even the deities,<br>and never among men. It is through the grace of Rudra that such devotion<br>arises in the hearts of human beings. In consequence of such devotion,<br>men, identifying themselves wholly with Mahadeva, succeed in attaining to<br>the highest success. The illustrious Deity who is always inclined to<br>extend his grace towards them that seek him with humility, and throw<br>themselves with their whole soul upon him rescues them from the world.<br>Except the great Deity who frees creatures from rebirth, all other gods<br>constantly nullify the penances of men, for men have no other source of<br>puissance that is as great as these.[186] It was even thus Tandi of<br>tranquil soul, resembling Indra himself in splendour, praised the<br>illustrious Lord of all existent and non-existent things,&#8212;that great<br>Deity clad in animal skins. Indeed, Brahma had sung this hymn in the<br>presence of Sankara. Thou art a Brahmana (being conversant with Brahman<br>and devoted to those that are conversant with Brahman). Thou shalt,<br>therefore, comprehend it well. This is cleansing, and washes away all<br>sins. This confers Yoga and Emancipation and heaven and contentment. He<br>who recites this hymn with undivided devotion to Sankara succeeds in<br>attaining to that high end which is theirs that are devoted to the<br>doctrines of the Sankhya philosophy. That worshipper who recites this<br>hymn daily for one year with singleness of devotion succeeds in obtaining<br>the end that he desires. This hymn is a great mystery. It formerly<br>resided in the breast of Brahma the Creator. Brahma imparted it unto<br>Sakra. Sakra imparted unto Mrityu. Mrityu imparted it unto the Rudras.<br>From the Rudras Tandi got it. Indeed Tandi acquired it in the region of<br>Brahman as the reward of his severe austerities. Tandi communicated it to<br>Sukra, and Sukra of Bhrigu's race communicated it to Gautama. Gautama in<br>his turn, O descendant of Madhu, communicated it to Vaivaswata-Manu. Manu<br>communicated it unto Narayana of great intelligence, numbered among the<br>Sadhyas and held exceedingly dear by him. The illustrious Narayana,<br>numbered among the Sadhyas and possessed of glory that knows no<br>diminution, communicated it to Yama. Vaivaswat Yama communicated it to<br>Nachiketa. Nachiketa, O thou of Vrishni's race, communicated to<br>Markandeya. From Markandeya, O Janarddana, I obtained it as the reward of<br>my vows and fasts. To thee, O slayer of foes, I communicate that hymn<br>unheard by others. This hymn leads to heaven. It dispels disease and<br>bestows long life. This is worthy of the highest praise, and is<br>consistent with the Vedas.'<br><br>"Krishna continued, 'That person, O Partha, who recites this hymn with a<br>pure heart observing the vow of Brahmacharyya, and with his senses under<br>control, regularly for one whole year, succeeds in obtaining the fruits<br>of a horse-sacrifice. Danavas and Yakshas and Rakshasas and Pisachas and<br>Yatudhanas and Guhyakas and snakes can do no injury to him.'"
