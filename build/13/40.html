                            "Bhishma said, 'It is even so as thou sayest, O thou of mighty arms.<br>There is nothing untrue in all this that thou sayest, O thou of Kuru's<br>race, on the subject of women. In this connection I shall recite to thee<br>the old history of how in days of yore the high-souled Vipula had<br>succeeded in restraining women within the bounds laid down for them. I<br>shall also tell thee, O king, how women were created by the Grandsire<br>Brahman and the object for which they were created by Him. There is no<br>creature more sinful, O son, than women. Woman is a blazing fire. She is<br>the illusion, O king, that the Daitya Maya created. She is the sharp edge<br>of the razor. She is poison. She is a snake. She is fire. She is, verily,<br>all these united together. It has been heard by us that all persons of<br>the human race are characterised by righteousness, and that they, in<br>course of natural progress and improvement, attain to the status of<br>deities. This circumstance alarmed the deities. They, therefore, O<br>chastiser of foes, assembled together and repaired to the presence of the<br>Grandsire. Informing Him of what was in their minds, they stood silent in<br>his presence, with downcast eyes. The puissant Grand sire having<br>ascertained what was in the hearts of the deities, created women, with<br>the aid of an Atharvan rite. In a former creation, O son of Kunti, women<br>were all virtuous. Those, however, that sprang from this creation by<br>Brahman with the aid of an illusion became sinful. The grandsire bestowed<br>upon them the desire of enjoyment, all kinds of carnal pleasure. Tempted<br>by the desire of enjoyment, they began to pursue persons of the other<br>sex. The puissant lord of the deities created Wrath as the companion of<br>Lust. Persons of the male sex, yielding to the power of Lust and Wrath,<br>sought the companionship of women. Women have no especial acts prescribed<br>for them. Even this is the ordinance that was laid down. The Sruti<br>declares that women are endued with senses the most powerful, that they<br>have no scriptures to follow, and that they are living lies. Beds and<br>seats and ornaments and food and drink and the absence of all that is<br>respectable and righteous, indulgence in disagreeable words, and love of<br>sexual companionship,&#8212;these were bestowed by Brahman upon women. Men are<br>quite unable to restrain them within bounds. The Creator himself is<br>incapable of restraining them within the limits that are proper: what<br>need then be said of men? This, O chief of men, I heard in former days,<br>viz., how Vipula had succeeded in protecting his preceptor's spouse in<br>ancient times. There was in days of yore a highly blessed Rishi of the<br>name of Devasarman of great celebrity. He had a wife, Ruchi by name, who<br>was unequalled on earth for beauty. Her loveliness intoxicated every<br>beholder among the deities and Gandharvas and Danavas. The chastiser of<br>Paka, viz., Indra, the slayer of Vritra, O monarch, was in particular<br>enamoured of her and coveted her person. The great ascetic Devasarman was<br>fully cognisant of the disposition of women. He, therefore, to the best<br>of his power and energy, protected her (from every kind of evil<br>influence). The Rishi knew that Indra was restrained by no scruples in<br>the matter of seeking the companionship of other people's wives. It was<br>for this reason that he used to protect his spouse, putting forth all his<br>power. Once on a time, O son, the Rishi became desirous of performing a<br>sacrifice. He began to think of how (during his own absence from home)<br>his wife could be protected. Endued with high ascetic merit, he at last<br>hit upon the course he should adopt. Summoning his favourite disciple<br>whose name was Vipula and who was of Bhrigu's race, he said as follows:<br><br>"Devasarman said, 'I shall leave home (for a while) in order to perform a<br>sacrifice. The chief of the celestials always covets this Ruchi of mine.<br>Do thou, during my absence, protect her, putting forth all thy might!<br>Thou shalt pass thy time heedfully in view of Purandara. O foremost one<br>of Bhrigu's race, that Indra assumes various disguises.'<br><br>Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by his preceptor, the ascetic Vipula<br>with senses under control, always engaged in severe penances, possessed<br>of the splendour, O king, of fire or the sun conversant with all the<br>duties of righteousness, and ever truthful in speech, answered him,<br>saying, 'So be it.' Once more, however, as his preceptor was about to set<br>out Vipula asked him in these words.'<br><br>"Vipula said, Tell me, O Muni, what forms does Sakra assume when he<br>presents himself. Of what kind is his body and what is his energy? It<br>behoveth thee to say all this to me.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The illustrious Rishi then truly described unto the<br>high-souled Vipula all the illusions of Sakra, O Bharata.'<br><br>"Devasarman said, 'The puissant chastiser of Paka, O regenerate Rishi, is<br>full of illusion. Every moment he assumes those forms that he chooses.<br>Sometimes he wears a diadem and holds the thunderbolt. Sometimes armed<br>with the thunderbolt and wearing a crown on his head, he adorns himself<br>with ear-rings, in a moment he transforms himself into the shape and<br>aspect of Chandala. Sometimes, he appears with coronal locks on his head:<br>soon again, O son, he shows himself with matted locks, his person clad<br>the while in rags. Sometimes, he assumes a goodly and gigantic frame. The<br>next moment he transforms himself into one of emaciated limbs, and<br>dressed in rags. Sometimes he becomes fair, sometimes darkish, sometimes<br>dark of complexion. Sometimes he becomes ugly and sometimes as possessed<br>of great comeliness of person. Sometimes he shows himself as young and<br>sometimes as old Sometimes he appears as a Brahmana, sometimes as a<br>Kshatriya, sometimes as a Vaisya, and sometimes as a Sudra. Verily, he of<br>a hundred sacrifices appears at times as a person born of impure order,<br>that is as the son of a superior father by an inferior mother or of an<br>inferior father by a superior mother. Sometimes he appears as a parrot,<br>sometimes as a crow, sometimes as a swan, and sometimes as a cuckoo. He<br>assumes the forms also of a lion, a tiger, or an elephant. Sometimes he<br>shows himself as a god, sometimes as a Daitya, and sometimes he assumes<br>the guise of a king. Sometimes he appears as fat and plump. Sometimes as<br>one whose limbs have been broken by the action of disordered wind in the<br>system, sometimes as a bird, and sometimes as one of exceedingly ugly<br>features. Sometimes he appears as a quadruped. Capable of assuming any<br>form, he sometimes appears as an idiot destitute of all intelligence. He<br>assumes also the forms of flies and gnats. O Vipula, no one can make him<br>out in consequence of these innumerable disguises that he is capable of<br>assuming. The very Creator of the universe is not equal to that feat. He<br>makes himself invisible when he chooses. He is incapable of being seen<br>except with the eye of knowledge. The chief of the celestials sometimes<br>transforms himself into the wind. The chastiser of Paka always assumes<br>these disguises. Do thou, therefore, O Vipula, protect this<br>slender-waisted spouse of mine with great care. O foremost one of<br>Bhrigu's race, do thou take every care for seeing that the chief of the<br>celestials may not defile this spouse of mine like a wretched dog licking<br>the Havi kept in view of a sacrifice. Having said these words, the<br>highly-blessed Muni, viz., Devasarman, intend upon performing a<br>sacrifice, set out from his abode, O chief of the Bharatas. Hearing these<br>words of his preceptor, Vipula began to think, 'I shall certainly protect<br>this lady in every respect from the puissant chief of the celestials. But<br>what should be the means? What can I do in this matter of protecting the<br>wife of my preceptor? The chief of the celestials is endued with large<br>powers of illusion. Possessed of great energy, he is difficult of being<br>resisted. Indra cannot be kept out by enclosing this retreat of ours or<br>fencing this yard, since he is capable of assuming innumerable forms.<br>Assuming the form of the wind, the chief of the celestials may assault<br>the spouse of my preceptor. The best course, therefore, for me, would be<br>to enter (by Yoga-power) the body of this lady and remain there. By<br>putting forth my prowess I shall not be able to protect the lady, for the<br>puissant chastiser of Paka, it has been heard by me, is capable of<br>assuming any form he likes. I shall, therefore, protect this one from<br>Indra by my Yoga-power. For carrying out my object I shall with my body<br>enter the body of this lady. If my preceptor, coming back, beholds his<br>spouse defiled, he will, without doubt, curse me through wrath, for<br>endued with great ascetic merit, he is possessed of spiritual vision.<br>This lady is incapable of being protected in the way in which other women<br>are protected by men, since the chief of the celestials is endued with<br>large powers of illusion. Alas, the situation in which I find myself is<br>very critical. The behest of my preceptor should certainly be obeyed by<br>me. If, therefore, I protect her by my Yoga-power, the feat will be<br>regarded by all as a wonderful one. By my Yoga-power, therefore, I shall<br>enter the body of my preceptor's lady. I shall stay within her and yet<br>not touch her person, like a drop of water on a lotus-leaf which lies on<br>it and yet does not drench it at all. If I be free from the taint of<br>passion, I cannot incur any fault by doing what I wish to do. As a<br>traveller, in course of his sojourn, takes up his residence (for a while)<br>in any empty mansion he finds, I shall, after the same manner, reside<br>this day within the body of my preceptor's lady Verily, with mind rapt up<br>in Yoga, I shall dwell today in this lady's body! Giving his best<br>consideration to these points of righteousness, thinking of all the Vedas<br>and their branches, and with eye directed to the large measure of<br>penances which his preceptor had and which he himself also was possessed<br>of, and having settled in his mind, with a view only to protect the lady,<br>to enter her person by Yoga-power. Vipula of Bhrigu's race took great<br>care (for accomplishing his purpose). Listen now to me, O monarch, as I<br>recite to thee what he did. Endued with great penances, Vipula sat<br>himself down by the side of his preceptor's spouse as she of faultless<br>features was sitting in her cottage, Vipula then began to discourse to<br>her bringing her over to the cause of righteousness and truth. Directing<br>his eyes then to hers and uniting the rays of light that emanated from<br>her organs of vision with those that issued from his, Vipula (in his<br>subtile form) entered the lady's body even as the element of wind enters<br>that of ether of space. Penetrating her eyes with his eyes and her face<br>with his face, Vipula stayed, without moving, within her invisibly, like<br>her shadow. Restraining every part of the lady's body, Vipula continued<br>to dwell within her, intent on protecting her from Indra. The lady<br>herself knew nothing of this. It was in this way, O monarch, that Vipula<br>continued to protect the lady till the time of his high-souled<br>preceptor's coming back after accomplishing the sacrifice which he had<br>gone out to perform.'"
