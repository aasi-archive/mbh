                            "Bhishma said, 'When that night passed away, the high-souled king Kusika<br>awoke and went through his morning rites. Accompanied by his wife he then<br>proceeded towards that wood which the Rishi had selected for his<br>residence. Arrived there, the monarch saw a palatial mansion made<br>entirely of gold. Possessed of a thousand columns each of which was made<br>of gems and precious stones, it looked like an edifice belonging to the<br>Gandharvas.[308] Kusika beheld in every part of that structure evidences<br>of celestial design. And he beheld hills with delightful valleys, and<br>lakes with lotuses on their bosom; and mansions full of costly and<br>curious articles, and gateways and arches, O Bharata. And the king saw<br>many open glades and open spots carpeted with grassy verdure, and<br>resembling level fields of gold. And he saw many Sahakaras adorned with<br>blossoms, and Ketakas and Uddalakas, and Dhavas and Asokas, and<br>blossoming Kundas, and Atimuktas. And he saw there many Champakas and<br>Tilakas and Bhavyas and Panasas and Vanjulas and Karnikaras adorned with<br>flowers. And the king beheld many Varanapushpas and the creepers called<br>Ashtapadika all clipped properly and beautifully.[309] And the king<br>beheld trees on which lotuses of all varieties bloomed in all their<br>beauty, and some of which bore flowers of every season. And he noticed<br>also many mansions that looked like celestial cars or like beautiful<br>mountains. And at some places, O Bharata, there were tanks and lakes full<br>of cool water and at others were those that were full of warm or hot<br>water. And there were diverse kinds of excellent seats and costly beds,<br>and bedsteads made of gold and gems and overlaid with cloths and carpets<br>of great beauty and value. Of comestible there were enormous quantities,<br>well-dressed and ready for use. And there were talking parrots and<br>she-parrots and Bhringarajas and Kokilas and Catapatras with Koyashtikas<br>and Kukkubhas, and peacocks and cocks and Datyuhas and Jivajivakas and<br>Chakoras and monkeys and swans and Sarasas and Chakravakas.[310] Here and<br>there he beheld bevies of rejoicing Apsaras and conclaves of happy<br>Gandharvas, O monarch. And he beheld other Gandharvas at other places<br>rejoicing with their dear spouses. The king sometimes beheld these sights<br>and sometimes could not see them (for they seemed to disappear from<br>before his eyes). The monarch heard also melodious strains of vocal music<br>and the agreeable voices of preceptors engaged in lecturing to their<br>disciples on the Vedas and the scriptures. And the monarch also heard the<br>harmonious cackle of the geese sporting in the lakes. Beholding such<br>exceedingly wonderful sights, the king began to reflect inwardly, saying,<br>'Is this a dream? Or is all this due to an aberration of my mind? Or, is<br>it all real? O, I have, without casting off my earthly tenement, attained<br>to the beatitude of heaven! This land is either the sacred country of the<br>Uttara-Kurus, or the abode, called Amaravati, of the chief of the<br>celestials! O, what are these wonderful sights that I behold!' Reflecting<br>in this strain, the monarch at last saw that foremost of Rishis. In that<br>palace of gold (endued) with columns (made) of jewels and gems, lay the<br>son of Bhrigu stretched on a costly and excellent bed. With his wife by<br>his side the king approached with a delighted heart the Rishi as he lay<br>on that bed. Chyavana, however, quickly disappeared at this, with the bed<br>itself upon which he lay. The king then beheld the Rishi at another part<br>of those woods seated on a mat made of Kusa grass, and engaged in<br>mentally reciting some high Mantras. By his Yoga-power, even thus did<br>that Brahmana stupefy the king. In a moment that delightful wood, those<br>bevies of Apsaras, those bands of Gandharvas, those beautiful trees,&#8212;all<br>disappeared. The bank of the Ganga became as silent as usual, and<br>presented the old aspect of its being covered with Kusa grass and<br>ant-hills. King Kusika with his wife having beheld that highly wonderful<br>sight and its quick disappearance also, became filled with amazement.<br>With a delighted heart, the monarch addressed his wife and said unto her,<br>'Behold, O amiable one, the various agreeable scenes and sights,<br>occurring nowhere else, which we two have just witnessed! All this is due<br>to the grace of Bhrigu's son and the puissance of his penances. By<br>penances all that becomes attainable which one cherishes in one's<br>imagination. Penances are superior to even the sovereignty over the three<br>worlds. By penances well-performed, emancipation itself may be achieved.<br>Behold, the puissance of the high-souled and celestial Rishi Chyavana<br>derived from his penances. He can, at his pleasure, create even other<br>worlds (than those which exist). Only Brahmanas are born in this world to<br>attain to speech and understanding and acts that are sacred. Who else<br>than Chyavana could do all this? Sovereignty may be acquired with ease.<br>But the status of a Brahmana is not so attainable. It was through the<br>puissance of a Brahmana that we were harnessed to a car like well-broken<br>animals!' These reflections that passed through the king's brain became<br>known to Chyavana. Ascertaining the king's thoughts, the Rishi addressed<br>him and said, 'Come hither quickly!' Thus addressed, the king and the<br>queen approached the great ascetic, and, bending their heads, they<br>worshipped him who deserved worship. Uttering a benediction upon the<br>monarch, the Rishi, possessed of great intelligence, O chief of men,<br>comforted the king and said, 'Sit down on that seat!' After this, O<br>monarch, the son of Bhrigu, without guile or insincerity of any kind,<br>gratified the king with many soft words, and then said, 'O king, thou<br>hast completely subjugated the five organs of action and the five organs<br>of knowledge with the mind as their sixth. Thou hast for this come out<br>unscathed from the fiery ordeal I had prepared for thee. I have been<br>properly honoured and adored, O son, by thee, O foremost of all persons<br>possessed of speech. Thou hast no sin, not even a minute one, in thee!<br>Give me leave, O king, for I shall now proceed to the place I came from.<br>I have been exceedingly pleased with thee, O monarch! Do thou accept the<br>boon I am ready to give.'<br><br>"Kusika said, 'In thy presence, O holy one, I have stayed like one<br>staying in the midst of a fire. That I have not yet, O chief of Bhrigu's<br>race been consumed, is sufficient! Even this is the highest boon that has<br>been obtained, O delighter of Bhrigu! That thou hast been gratified by<br>me, O Brahmana, and that I have succeeded in rescuing my race from<br>destruction, O sinless one, constitute in my case the best boons. This I<br>regard, O learned Brahmana, as a distinct evidence of thy grace. The end<br>of my life has been accomplished. Even this is what I regard the very end<br>of my sovereignty. Even this is the highest fruit of my penances![311]<br>If, O learned Brahmana, thou hast been pleased with me, O delighter of<br>Bhrigu, then do thou expound some doubts which are in my mind!'
