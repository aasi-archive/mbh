                            "Bhishma said, 'Having accomplished his preceptor's behest, Vipula<br>practised the most severe penances. Possessed of great energy, he at last<br>regarded himself as endued with sufficient ascetic merit, Priding himself<br>upon the feat he had achieved, he wandered fearlessly and contentedly<br>over the earth, O monarch, regarded by all as one possessed of great fame<br>for what he had done. The puissant Bhargava regarded that he had<br>conquered both the worlds by that feat of his as also by his severe<br>penances. After some time had passed away, O delighter of the Kurus, the<br>occasion came for a ceremony of gifts to take place with respect to the<br>sister of Ruchi. Abundant wealth and corn were to be given away in<br>it.[276] Meanwhile, a certain celestial damsel endued with great beauty,<br>was journeying through the skies. From her body as she coursed through<br>the welkin, some flowers dropped down on the earth. Those flowers<br>possessed of celestial fragrance fell on a spot not far from the retreat<br>of Ruchi's husband. As the flowers lay scattered on the ground, they were<br>picked up by Ruchi of beautiful eyes. Soon after an invitation came to<br>Ruchi from the country of the Angas. The sister, referred to above, of<br>Ruchi, named Prabhavati, was the spouse of Chitraratha, the ruler of the<br>Angas. Ruchi, of very superior complexion, having attached those flowers<br>to her hair, went to the palace of the king of the Angas in answer to the<br>invitation she had received. Beholding those flowers on her hair the<br>queen of the Angas, possessed of beautiful eyes, urged her sister to<br>obtain some for her. Ruchi, of beautiful face, speedily informed her<br>husband of that request of her sister. The Rishi accepted the prayer of<br>his sister-in-law. Summoning Vipula into his presence Devasarman of<br>severe penances commanded his disciple to bring him some flowers of the<br>same kind, saying, 'Go, go!' Accepting without hesitation the behest of<br>his preceptor, the great ascetic Vipula, O king, answered, 'So be it!'<br>and then proceeded to that spot whence the lady Ruchi had picked up the<br>flowers that were coveted by her sister. Arrived at that spot where the<br>flowers (picked up by Ruchi) had fallen from the welkin, Vipula saw some<br>others still lying scattered. They were all as fresh as if they had been<br>newly plucked from the plants whereon they had grown. None of them had<br>drooped in the least. He took up those celestial flowers of great beauty.<br>Possessed of celestial fragrance, O Bharata, Vipula got them there as the<br>result of his severe penances. The accomplisher of his preceptor's<br>behest, having obtained them, he felt great delight and set out speedily<br>for the city of Champa adorned with festoons of Champaka flowers. As he<br>proceeded, he saw on his way a human couple moving in a circle hand in<br>hand. One of them made a rapid step and thereby destroyed the cadence of<br>the movement. For this reason, O king, a dispute arose between them.<br>Indeed, one of them charged the other, saying, 'Thou hast made a quicker<br>step!' The other answered, 'No, verily', as each maintained his own<br>opinion obstinately, each, O king, asserted what the other denied, and<br>denied what the other asserted. While thus disputing with each other with<br>great assurance, an oath was then heard among them. Indeed, each of them<br>suddenly named Vipula in what they uttered. The oath each of them took<br>was even this, 'That one amongst us two who speaketh falsely, shall in<br>the next world, meet with the end which will be the regenerate Vipula's!'<br>Hearing these words of theirs, Vipula's face became very cheerless. He<br>began to reflect, saying unto himself, 'I have undergone severe penances.<br>The dispute between this couple is hot. To me, again, it is painful. What<br>is the sin of which I have been guilty that both these persons should<br>refer to my end in the next world as the most painful one among those<br>reserved for all creatures?' Thinking in this strain, Vipula, O best of<br>monarchs, hung down his head, and with a cheerless mind began to<br>recollect what sin he had done. Proceeding a little way he beheld six<br>other men playing with dice made of gold and silver. Engaged in play,<br>those individuals seemed to him to be so excited that the hair on their<br>bodies stood on end. They also (upon a dispute having arisen among them)<br>were heard by Vipula to take the same oath that he had already heard the<br>first couple to take. Indeed, their words had reference in the same way<br>to Vipula, 'He amongst us who, led by cupidity, will act in an improper<br>way, shall meet with that end which is reserved for Vipula in the next<br>world!' Hearing these words, however, Vipula, although he strove<br>earnestly to recollect failed to remember any transgression of his from<br>even his earliest years, O thou of Kuru's race. Verily he began to burn<br>like a fire placed in the midst of another fire. Hearing that curse, his<br>mind burnt with grief. In this state of anxiety a long time elapsed. At<br>last he recollected the manner in which he had acted in protecting his<br>preceptor's wife from the machinations of Indra. 'I had penetrated the<br>body of that lady, placing limb within limb, face within face, Although I<br>had acted in this way, I did not yet tell my preceptor the truth!' Even<br>this was the transgression. O thou of Kuru's race which Vipula<br>recollected in himself. Indeed, O blessed monarch, without doubt that was<br>the transgression which he had actually committed. Coming to the city of<br>Champa, he gave the flowers to his preceptor. Devoted to superiors and<br>seniors, he worshipped his preceptor in due form.'"
