                            "Bhishma said, 'The illustrious Atri, the son of the Grandsire Brahman,<br>said, 'They who make gifts of gold are said to make gifts of everything<br>in the world.' King Harischandra said that the gift of gold is<br>sin-cleansing, leads to long life, and becomes productive of<br>inexhaustible merit unto the Pitris. Manu has said that a gift of drink<br>is the best of all gifts: therefore should a man cause wells and tanks<br>and lakes to be excavated. A well full of water and from which diverse<br>creatures draw water, is said to take off half the sinful acts of the<br>person who has excavated it. The whole race of a person is rescued from<br>hell and sin in whose well or tank or lake kine and Brahmanas and<br>righteous people constantly quench their thirst. That man transcends<br>every kind of calamity from whose well or tank every one draws water<br>without restraint during the summer season. Ghee is said to gratify the<br>illustrious Vrihaspati, Pushan, Bhaga, the twin Aswins, and the deity of<br>fire. Ghee is possessed of high medicinal virtues. It is a high requisite<br>for sacrifice. It is the best of all liquids. The merit a gift of ghee<br>produces is very superior. That man who is desirous of the reward of<br>happiness in the next world, who wishes for fame and prosperity, should<br>with a cleansed soul and having purified himself make gifts of ghee unto<br>the Brahmanas. Upon that man who makes gifts of ghee unto the Brahmanas<br>in the month of Aswin, the twin Aswins, gratified, confer personal<br>beauty. Rakshasas never invade the abode of that man who makes gifts unto<br>the Brahmanas of Payasa mixed with ghee. That man never dies of thirst<br>who makes gifts unto the Brahmanas of jars filled with water. Such a<br>person obtains every necessary of life in abundance, and has never to<br>undergo any calamity or distress. That man, who with great devotion and<br>restrained senses makes gifts unto the foremost of Brahmanas, is said to<br>take a sixth part of the merits won by the Brahmanas by their penances.<br>That man who makes presents unto Brahmanas having the means of life, of<br>firewood for purposes of cooking as also of enabling them to drive cold,<br>finds all his purposes and all his acts crowned with success. Such a one<br>is seen to shine with great splendour over all his enemies. The<br>illustrious deity of fire becomes pleased with such a man. As another<br>reward, he never becomes divested of cattle, and he is sure to achieve<br>victory in battles. The man who makes a gift of an umbrella obtains<br>children and great prosperity. Such a person is never affected by any<br>eye-disease. The merits also that spring from the performance of a<br>sacrifice become his. That man who makes a gift of an umbrella in the<br>season of summer or rains, has never to meet with any heart-burning on<br>any account. Such a man quickly succeeds in freeing himself from every<br>difficulty and impediment. The highly blessed and illustrious Rishi<br>Sandilya has said that, of all gifts, the gift of a car, O king, is the<br>best.'"
