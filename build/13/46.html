                            "Bhishma said, They that are conversant with ancient history recite the<br>following verse of Daksha, the son of Prachetas: That maiden, in respect<br>of whom nothing is taken by her kinsmen in the form of dowry cannot be<br>said to be sold.[293] Respect, kind treatment, and everything else that<br>is agreeable, should all be given unto the maiden whose hand is taken in<br>marriage. Her sire and brothers and father-in-law and husband's brothers<br>should show her every respect and adorn her with ornaments, if they be<br>desirous of reaping benefits, for such conduct on their part always leads<br>to considerable happiness and advantage. If the wife does not like her<br>husband or fails to gladden him, from such dislike and absence of joy,<br>the husband can never have issue for increasing his race. Women, O king,<br>should always be worshipped and treated with affection. There where women<br>are treated with respect, the very deities are said to be filled with<br>joy. There where women are not worshipped, all acts become fruitless. If<br>the women of a family, in consequence of the treatment they receive,<br>grieve and shed tears, that family soon becomes extinct. Those houses<br>that are cursed by women meet with destruction and ruin as if scorched by<br>some Atharvan rite. Such houses lose their splendour. Their growth and<br>prosperity cease. O king, Mann, on the eve of his departure for Heaven,<br>made over women to the care and protection of men, saying that they are<br>weak, that they fall an easy prey to the seductive wiles of men,[294]<br>disposed to accept the love that is offered them, and devoted to truth.<br>There are others among them that are full of malice, covetous of honours,<br>fierce in disposition, unlovable, and impervious to reason. Women,<br>however, deserve to be honoured. Do ye men show them honour. The<br>righteousness of men depends upon women. All pleasures and enjoyments<br>also completely depend upon them. Do ye serve them and worship them. Do<br>ye bend your wills before them. The begetting of offspring, the nursing<br>of children already born, and the accomplishment of all acts necessary<br>for the needs of society, behold, all these have women for their cause.<br>By honouring women, ye are sure to attain to the fruition of all objects.<br>In this connection a princess of the house of Janaka the ruler of the<br>Videhas, sang a verse. It is this: Women have no sacrifices ordained for<br>them. There are no Sraddhas which they are called upon to perform. They<br>are not required to observe any facts. To serve their husbands with<br>reverence and willing obedience is their only duty. Through the discharge<br>of that duty they succeed in conquering heaven. In childhood, the sire<br>protects her. The husband protects her in youth. When she becomes old,<br>her sons, protect her. At no period of her life does woman deserve to be<br>free. Deities of prosperity are women. The person that desire affluence<br>and prosperity should honour them. By cherishing women, O Bharata, one<br>cherishes the goddess of prosperity herself, and by afflicting her, one<br>is said to afflict the goddess of prosperity.'"
