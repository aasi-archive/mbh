                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast, O grandsire, discoursed to me, in detail<br>on the merits that attach to the gift of gold agreeably with the<br>ordinances laid down in the scriptures as indicated in the auditions of<br>the Veda. Thou hast also narrated what the origin is of gold. Do thou<br>tell me now how Taraka met with destruction. Thou hast said, O king, that<br>Asura had become unslayable by the gods. Do thou tell me in detail how<br>his destruction was brought about. O perpetuator of Kuru's race, I desire<br>to hear this from thee. I mean the details of Taraka's slaughter. Great<br>is my curiosity to hear the narrative.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The gods and the Rishis, O monarch, reduced to great<br>distress (by Taraka's prowess and the conduct of Ganga in casting off<br>Agni's seed), urged the six Krittikas to rear that child. Amongst the<br>celestial ladies there were none, save these, that could, by their<br>energy, bear the seed of Agni in their wombs. The god of fire became<br>exceedingly gratified with those goddesses for their readiness to sustain<br>the conception caused by the cast off seed of Agni which was endued with<br>his own high energy. When the energy of Agni, O king, was divided into<br>six portions and placed within the channels (leading to the womb), the<br>six Krittikas began to nourish the portion that each held in her womb. As<br>the high-souled Kumara, however, began to grow within their wombs, their<br>bodies being afflicted by his energy, they failed to obtain peace<br>anywhere (in heaven or on earth). Filled with energy as their bodies<br>were, the time at last came for delivery. All of them, it so happened, O<br>prince of men, delivered at the same time. Though held in six different<br>wombs, yet all the portions, as they came out, united into one. The<br>goddess Earth held the child, taking it up from a heap of gold. Verily,<br>the child, endued with excellent form, blazed with splendour even like<br>the god of Fire. Of beautiful features, he began to grow in a delightful<br>forest of reeds. The six Krittikas beheld that child of theirs looking<br>like the morning sun in splendour. Filled with affection for<br>him,&#8212;indeed, loving him very much,&#8212;they began to rear him with the<br>sustenance of their breasts. In consequence of his having been born of<br>the Krittikas and reared by them, he came to be known throughout the<br>three worlds as Kartikeya. Having sprung from the seed which had fallen<br>off from Rudra he was named Skanda, and because of his birth in the<br>solitude of a forest of reeds he came to be called by the name of Guha<br>(the secret-born). The gods numbering three and thirty, the points of the<br>compass (in their embodied forms) together with the deities presiding<br>over them, and Rudra and Dhatri and Vishnu and Yama and Pushan and<br>Aryaman and Bhaga, and Angas and Mitra and the Sadhyas and Vasava and the<br>Vasus and the Aswins and the Waters and the Wind and the Firmament and<br>Chandramas and all the Constellations and the Planets and Surya, and all<br>the Ricks and Samans and Yajuses in their embodied forms, came there to<br>behold that wonderful child who was the son of the deity of blazing<br>flames. The Rishis uttered hymns of praise and the Gandharvas sang in<br>honour of that child called Kumara of six heads, twice six eyes, and<br>exceedingly devoted to the Brahmanas. His shoulders were broad, and he<br>had a dozen arms, and the splendour of his person resembled that of fire<br>and Aditya. As he lay stretched on a clump of heath, the gods with the<br>Rishis, beholding him, became filled with great delight and regarded the<br>great Asura as already slain. The deities then began to bring him diverse<br>kinds of toys and articles that could amuse him. As he played like a<br>child, diverse kinds of toys and birds were given unto him. Garuda of<br>excellent feathers gave unto him a child of his, viz., a peacock endued<br>with plumes of variegated hue. The Rakshasas gave unto him a boar and a<br>buffalo. Aruna himself gave him a cock of fiery splendour. Chandramas<br>gave him a sheep, and Aditya gave him some dazzling rays of his. The<br>mother of all kine, viz., Surabhi, gave him kine by hundreds and<br>thousands. Agni gave him a goat possessed of many good qualities. Ila<br>gave him an abundant quantity of flowers and fruit. Sudhanwan gave him a<br>riding chariot and a car of Kuvara. Varuna gave him many auspicious and<br>excellent, products of the Ocean, with some elephants. The chief of the<br>celestials gave him lions and tigers and pards and diverse kinds of<br>feathery denizens of the air, and many terrible beasts of prey and many<br>umbrellas also of diverse kinds. Rakshasas and Asuras, in large bands,<br>began to walk in the train of that puissant child. Beholding the son of<br>Agni grow up, Taraka sought, by various means, to effect his destruction,<br>but he failed to do anything unto that puissant deity. The god in time<br>invested Agni's son born in the solitude (of a forest of reeds) with the<br>command of their forces. And they also informed him of the oppressions<br>committed upon them by the Asura Taraka. The generalissimo of the<br>celestial forces grew up and became possessed of great energy and<br>puissance. In time Guha slew Taraka, with his irresistible dart. Verily,<br>Kumara slew the Asura as easily as if in sport. Having accomplished the<br>destruction of Taraka he re-established the chief of the deities in his<br>sovereignty of the three worlds. Endued with mighty prowess, the<br>celestial generalissimo blazed with beauty and splendour. The puissant<br>Skanda became the protector of the deities and did what was agreeable to<br>Sankara. The illustrious son of Pavaka was endued with a golden form.<br>Verily, Kumara is always the leader of the celestial forces. Gold is the<br>puissant energy of the god of fire and was born with Kartikeya (from the<br>same seed). Hence is Gold highly auspicious and, as a valuable, is<br>excellent and endued with inexhaustible merit. Even thus, O son of Kuru's<br>race, did Vasishtha recite this discourse unto Rama of Bhrigu's race in<br>days of old. Do thou, therefore, O king of men, try to make gifts of<br>Gold. By making gifts of Gold, Rama became cleansed of all his sins, and<br>finally attained to a high place in heaven that is unattainable by other<br>men.'"
