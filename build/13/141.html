                            "The blessed and holy one said, 'In days of yore, a blessed woman was<br>created by Brahman, called Tilottama, by culling grains of beauty from<br>every beautiful object in the universe. One day, that lady of beautiful<br>face, unrivalled in the universe for beauty of form, came to me, O<br>goddess, for circumambulating me but really impelled by the desire of<br>tempting me. In whatever direction that lady of beautiful teeth turned, a<br>new face of mine instantly appeared (so eager did I become to see her).<br>All those faces of mine became agreeable to look at. Thus, in consequence<br>of the desire of beholding her, I became four-faced, through<br>Yoga-puissance, Thus, I showed my high Yoga-power in becoming four-faced.<br>With that face of mine which is turned towards the east, I exercise the<br>sovereignty of the universe, With that face of mine which is turned<br>towards the north, I sport with thee, O thou of faultless features! That<br>face of mine which is turned towards the west is agreeable and<br>auspicious. With it I ordain the happiness of all creatures. That face of<br>mine which is turned towards the south is terrible. With it I destroy all<br>creatures. I live as a Brahmacharin with matted locks on my head,<br>impelled by the desire of doing good to all creatures. The bow Pinaka is<br>always in my hand for accomplishing the purposes of the deities. In days<br>of yore, Indra, desirous of acquiring my prosperity, had hurled his<br>thunderbolt at me. With that weapon my throat was scorched. For this<br>reason I have become blue-throated.'<br><br>"Uma said, 'When, O foremost of all creatures, there are so many<br>excellent vehicles endued with great beauty, why is it that thou hast<br>selected a bovine bull for thy vehicle?'<br><br>"Maheswara said, 'In the days of yore, the Grandsire Brahma created the<br>celestial cow Surabhi yielding abundant milk. After her creation there<br>sprang from her a large number of kine all of which yielded copious<br>quantities of milk sweet as nectar. Once on a time a quantity of froth<br>fell from the mouth of one of her calves on my body. I was enraged at<br>this and my wrath scorched all the kine which thereupon became<br>diversified in hue. I was then pacified by the Master of all the worlds,<br>viz., Brahma, conversant with all topics. It was he who gave me this bull<br>both as a vehicle for bearing me and as a device on my banner.'<br><br>"Uma said, 'Thou hast many abodes in heaven, of diverse forms and<br>possessed of every comfort and luxury. Why, O holy one, dost thou reside<br>in the crematorium, abandoning all those delightful mansions? The<br>crematorium is full of the hair and bones (of the dead), abounds with<br>vulture and jackals, and is strewn with hundreds of funeral pyres. Full<br>of carrion and muddy with fat and blood, with entrails and bones strewn<br>all over it, and always echoing with the howls of jackals, it is<br>certainly an unclean place.'<br><br>"Maheswara said, 'I always wander over the whole earth in search of a<br>sacred spot. I do not, however, see any spot that is more sacred than the<br>crematorium. Hence, of all abodes, the crematorium pleases my heart most,<br>shaded that it generally is by branches of the banian and adorned with<br>torn garlands of flowers. O thou of sweet smiles, the multitudes of<br>ghostly beings that are my companions love to reside in such spots. I do<br>not like, O goddess, to reside anywhere without those ghostly creatures<br>being by my side. Hence, the crematorium is a sacred abode to me. Indeed,<br>O auspicious lady, it seems to me to be the very heaven. Highly sacred<br>and possessed of great merit, the crematorium is much applauded by<br>persons desirous of having holy abodes.'<br><br>"Uma said, 'O holy one, O lord of all creatures, O foremost of all<br>observers of duties and religious rites, I have a great doubt, O wielder<br>of Pinaka, O giver of boons. These ascetics, O puissant lord, have<br>undergone diverse kinds of austerities. In the world are seen ascetics<br>wandering everywhere under diverse forms and clad in diverse kinds of<br>attire. For benefiting this large assemblage of Rishis, as also myself,<br>do thou kindly resolve, O chastiser of all foes, this doubt of mine. What<br>indications has Religion or Duty been said to possess? How, indeed, do<br>men become unacquainted with the details of Religion or Duty to succeed<br>in observing them? O puissant lord, O thou that art conversant with<br>Religion, do thou tell me this.'<br><br>"Narada continued, 'When the daughter of Himavat put this question,<br>conclave of Rishis there present worshipped the goddess and adored her<br>with words adorned with Riks and with hymns fraught with deep import.'<br><br>"Maheswara said, 'Abstention from injury, truthfulness of speech,<br>compassion towards all beings, tranquillity of soul, and the making of<br>gifts to the best of one's power, are the foremost duties of the<br>householder. Abstention from sexual congress with the spouses of other<br>men, protection of the wealth and the woman committed to one's charge,<br>unwillingness to appropriate what is not given to one, and avoidance of<br>honey and meat,&#8212;these are the five chief duties. Indeed, Religion or<br>Duty has many branches all of which are fraught with happiness. Even<br>these are the duties which these embodied creatures who regard duty as<br>superior should observe and practise. Even these are the sources of<br>merit.'<br><br>"Uma said, O holy one, I wish to ask thee another question about which I<br>have great doubts. It behoveth thee to answer it and dispel my doubts.<br>What are the meritorious duties of the four several orders? What duties<br>appertain to the Brahmana? What to the Kshatriya? What are the<br>indications of those duties that appertain to the Vaisya? And what kind<br>of duties appertain to the Sudra?'<br><br>"The holy one said, 'O highly blessed lady, the question thou hast asked<br>is a very proper one. Those persons that belong to the regenerate order<br>are regarded as highly blessed, and are, indeed, gods on earth. Without<br>doubt, the observance of fasts (i.e., subjugation of the senses) is<br>always the duty of the Brahmana. When the Brahmana succeeds in properly<br>observing all his duties, he attains to identity with Brahma.[560] The<br>proper observance of the duties of Brahmacharya, O goddess, are his<br>ritual. The observance of vows and the investiture with the sacred thread<br>are his other duties. It is by these that he becomes truly regenerate. He<br>becomes a Brahmana for worshipping his preceptors and other seniors as<br>also the deities. Verily, that religion which has for its soul the study<br>of the Vedas is the source of all piety. Even that is the religion which<br>those embodied creatures who are devoted to piety and duty should observe<br>and practise.'<br><br>"Uma said, 'O holy one, my doubts have not been dispelled. It behoveth<br>thee to explain in detail what the duties are of the four respective<br>orders of men.'<br><br>"Maheswara said, 'Listening to the mysteries of religion and duty,<br>observance of the vows indicated in the Vedas, attention to the sacred<br>fire, and accomplishment of the business of the preceptor, leading a<br>mendicant life, always bearing the sacred thread, constant recitation of<br>the Vedas, and rigid observance of the duties of Brahmacharya, are the<br>duties of the Brahmana. After the period of study is over, the Brahmana,<br>receiving the command of his preceptor, should leave his preceptor's<br>abode for returning to his father's house. Upon his return he should duly<br>wed a wife that is fit for him. Another duty of the Brahmana consists in<br>avoiding the food prepared by the Sudra. Walking along the path of<br>righteousness, always observing fasts and the practices of Brahmacharya,<br>are his other duties.[561] The householder should keep up his domestic<br>fire for daily worship. He should study the Vedas. He should pour<br>libations in honour of the Pitris and the deities. He should keep his<br>senses under proper control. He should eat what remains after serving<br>gods and guests and all his dependants. He should be abstemious in food,<br>truthful in speech, and pure both externally and internally. Attending to<br>guests is another duty of the householder, as also the keeping up of the<br>three sacrificial fires. The householder should also attend to the<br>ordinary sacrifices that go by the name of Ishti and should also dedicate<br>animals to the deities according to the ordinances. Indeed, the<br>performance of sacrifices is his highest duty as also a complete<br>abstention from injury to all creatures. Never to eat before serving the<br>deities and guests and dependants is another duty of the householder. The<br>food that remains after serving gods and guests and dependants is called<br>Vighasa. The householder should eat Vighasa. Indeed, to eat after the<br>members of one's family including servants and other dependants, is<br>regarded as one of the special duties of the regenerate householder, who<br>should, be conversant with the Vedas. The conduct of husband and wife, in<br>the case of householder, should be equal. He should every day make<br>offerings of flowers and other articles unto those deities that preside<br>over domesticity. The householder should take care that his house is<br>every day properly rubbed (with cowdung and water). He should also<br>observe fasts every day. Well-cleaned and well-rubbed, his house should<br>also be every day fumigated with the smoke of clarified butter poured on<br>his sacred fire in honour of the deities and the Pitris. Even these are<br>the duties appertaining to the householder's mode of life as observable<br>by a regenerate person. Those duties really uphold the world. Verily,<br>those duties always and eternally flow from those righteous persons among<br>the Brahmanas that lead a life of domesticity. Do thou listen to me with<br>concentrated attention, O goddess, for I shall now tell thee what the<br>duties are which appertain to the Kshatriya and about which thou hast<br>asked me. From the beginning it has been said that the duty of the<br>Kshatriya is to protect all creatures. The king is the acquirer of a<br>fixed share of the merits earned by his subjects. By that means the king<br>becomes endued with righteousness. That ruler of men who rules and<br>protects his subjects righteously, acquires, by virtue of the protection<br>he offers to others, many regions of felicity in the world to come. The<br>other duties of a person of the kingly order consist of self-restraint<br>and Vedic study, the pouring of libations on the sacred fire, the making<br>of gifts, study, the bearing of the sacred thread, sacrifices, the<br>performance of religious rites, the support of servants and dependants,<br>and perseverance in acts that have been begun. Another duty of his is to<br>award punishments according to the offences committed. It is also his<br>duty to perform sacrifices and other religious rites according to the<br>ordinances laid down in the Vedas. Adherence to the practice of properly<br>judging the disputes of litigants before him, and a devotion to<br>truthfulness of speech, and interference for aiding the distressed, are<br>the other duties by discharging which the king acquires great glory both<br>here and hereafter. He should also lay down his life on the field of<br>battle, having displayed great prowess on behalf of kine and Brahmanas.<br>Such a king acquires in Heaven such regions of felicity as are capable of<br>being won by the performance of Horse-sacrifices. The duties of the<br>Vaisya always consist of the keeping of cattle and agriculture, the<br>pouring of libations on the sacred fire, the making of gifts, and study.<br>Trade, walking in the path of righteousness, hospitality, peacefulness,<br>self-restraint, welcoming of Brahmanas, and renouncing things (in favour<br>of Brahmanas), are the other eternal duties of the Vaisya. The Vaisya,<br>engaged in trade and walking in the path of righteousness, should never<br>sell sesame and perfumery and juices or liquid substances. He should<br>discharge the duties of hospitality towards all. He is at liberty to<br>pursue religion and wealth and pleasure according to his means and as<br>much as is judicious for him. The service of the three regenerate classes<br>constitutes the high duty of the Sudra. That Sudra who is truthful in<br>speech and who has subdued his senses is regarded as having acquired<br>meritorious penances. Verily, the Sudra, who having got a guest,<br>discharges the duties of hospitality towards him, is regarded as<br>acquiring the merit of high penances. That intelligent Sudra whose<br>conduct is righteous and who worships the deities and Brahmanas, becomes<br>endued with the desirable rewards of righteousness. O beautiful lady, I<br>have thus recited to thee what the duties are of the four orders. Indeed,<br>O blessed lady, I have told thee what their respective duties are. What<br>else dost thou wish to hear?'<br><br>"Uma said, 'Thou has recited to me what the respective duties are of the<br>four orders, auspicious and beneficial for them. Do thou now tell me, O<br>holy one, what the common duties are of all the orders.'<br><br>"Maheswara said, 'The foremost of all beings in the universe viz., the<br>Creator Brahma, ever desirous of righteous accomplishments, created the<br>Brahmanas for rescuing all the worlds. Among all created beings, they<br>are, verily, gods on earth. I shall at the outset tell thee what the<br>religious acts are which they should do and what the rewards are which<br>they win through them. That religion which has been ordained for the<br>Brahmanas is the foremost of all religions. For the sake of the<br>righteousness of the world, three religions were created by the Self-born<br>One. Whenever the world is created (or re-created), those religions are<br>created by the Grandsire. Do thou listen. These are the three eternal<br>religions. The religion that is propounded in the Vedas is the highest;<br>that which is propounded in the Smritis is the next in the order of<br>importance; the third in importance is that which is based upon the<br>practices of those who are regarded as righteous. The Brahmans possessed<br>of learning should have the three Vedas. He should never make the study<br>of the Vedas (or recitation of the scriptures) the means of his<br>living.[562] He should devote himself to the three well-known acts (of<br>making gifts, studying the Vedas, and performing sacrifices). He should<br>transcend' the three (viz., lust, wrath, and covetousness). He should be<br>the friend of all creatures. A person that possesses these attributes is<br>called a Brahmans. The lord of the universe declared these six acts for<br>the observance of Brahmanas. Listen to those eternal duties. The<br>performance of sacrifices, officiating at the sacrifices of others, the<br>making of gifts, the acceptance of gifts, teaching, and study, are the<br>six acts by accomplishing which a Brahmans wins religious merit. Verily,<br>the daily study of the Vedas is a duty. Sacrifice is (another) eternal<br>duty. The making of gifts according to the measure of his power and<br>agreeable to the ordinance, is, in his case, much applauded. Tranquillity<br>of mind is a high duty that has always been current among them that are<br>righteous. Householders of pure mind are capable of earning very great<br>merit. Indeed, he who cleanses his soul by the performance of the five<br>sacrifices, who is truthful in speech, who is free from malice, who makes<br>gifts, who treats with hospitality and honour all regenerate guests, who<br>lives in well-cleaned abodes, who is free from pride, who is always<br>sincere in his dealings, who uses sweet and assuring words towards<br>others, who takes pleasure in serving guests and others arrived at his<br>abode, and who eats the food that remains after the requirements have<br>been gratified of all the members of his family and dependants, wins<br>great merit. That man who offers water to his guests for washing their<br>feet and hands, who presents the Arghya for honouring the recipient, who<br>duly gives seats, and beds, and lamps for lighting the darkness, and<br>shelter to those that come to his abode, is regarded as highly righteous.<br>That householder who rises at dawn and washes his mouth and 'face and<br>serves food to his guests, and having honoured them duly dismisses them<br>from his abode and follows them (as a mark of honour) for a little<br>distance, acquires eternal merit. Hospitality towards all, and the<br>pursuit of the aggregate of three, are the duties of the householder. The<br>duties of the Sudra consist in the pursuit of the aggregate of three. The<br>Religion ordained for the householder is said to have Pravritti for its<br>chief indication. Auspicious, and beneficial to all creatures, I shall<br>expound it to thee. The householder should always make gifts according to<br>the measure of his power. He should also perform sacrifices frequently<br>after the same manner. Indeed, he who wishes to achieve his own good<br>should always achieve meritorious acts. The householder, should acquire<br>wealth by righteous means. The wealth thus acquired should be carefully<br>divided into three portions, keeping the requirements of righteousness in<br>view. With one of those portions he should accomplish all acts of<br>righteousness. With another he should seek to gratify his cravings for<br>pleasure. The third portion he should lay out for increasing. The<br>Religion of Nivritti is different. It exists for emancipation (from<br>re-birth by absorption into Brahman). I shall tell thee the conduct that<br>constitutes it. Listen to me in detail, O goddess. One of the duties<br>inculcated by that religion is compassion towards all creatures. The man<br>that follows it should not reside in one place for more than one day.<br>Desirous of achieving emancipation, the followers of this Religion free<br>themselves from the bonds of hope (or desire). They have no attachment to<br>habitation, to the Kamandalu they bear for keeping water, to the robes<br>that cover their loins, or the seat whereupon they rest, or the triple<br>stick they bear in their hands, or the bed they sleep on, or the fire<br>they want, or the chamber that houses them. A follower of this Religion<br>sets his heart upon the workings of his soul. His mind is devoted to<br>Supreme Brahman. He is filled with the idea of attaining to Brahman. He<br>is always devoted to Yoga and the Sankhya Philosophy. He desires no other<br>shelter than the foot of a tree. He houses himself in empty abodes of<br>men. He sleeps on the banks of rivers. He takes pleasure in staying by<br>such banks. He is freed from every attachment, and from every tie of<br>affection. He merges the existence of his own soul into the Supreme Soul.<br>Standing like a stake of wood, and abstaining from all food he does only<br>such acts as point to Emancipation. Or, he may wander about, devoted to<br>Yoga. Even these are the eternal duties of a follower of the Religion of<br>Nivritti. He lives aloof from his species. He is freed from all<br>attachments. He never resides in the same place for more than a day.<br>Freed from all bonds he roves over the world. Emancipated from all ties,<br>he never sleeps on even the same river-bank for more than a day. Even<br>this is the religion of persons conversant with Emancipation as declared<br>in the Vedas. Even this is the righteous path that is trodden by the<br>righteous. He who follows in this track leaves no vestige behind.<br>Bhikshus (or followers of the religion of Emancipation) are of four<br>kinds. They are Kutichakas, Vahudakas, Hansas, and Paramahansas. The<br>second is superior to the first, the third to the second, and the fourth<br>to the third. There is nothing superior to the Paramahansa; nor is there<br>anything inferior to it or beside it or before it. It is a condition that<br>is divested of sorrow and happiness; that is auspicious and freed from<br>decrepitude and death and that knows no change.'[563]<br><br>"Uma said, 'Thou halt recited the religion of the householders, that of<br>Emancipation, and that which is based upon the observances of the<br>righteous. These paths are high and exceedingly beneficial to the world<br>of living creatures. O thou that art conversant with every religion, I<br>desire now to hear what is the high religion of the Rishis. I always have<br>a liking for those that dwell in ascetic retreats. The perfume that<br>emanates from the smoke of the libations of clarified butter poured on<br>the sacred fire seems to pervade the entire retreats and make them<br>delightful. Marking this, O great god, my heart becomes always filled<br>with delight. O puissant deity, I have doubts regarding the religion of<br>the ascetics. Thou art conversant with the details of all religions. Do<br>thou enlighten me, O god of gods, in detail, respecting this topic truly<br>about which I have asked thee, O great deity!'<br><br>"The blessed and holy one said, 'Yes, I shall recite to thee the high and<br>excellent religion of the ascetics. By following the dictates of that<br>religion, O auspicious lady, the ascetics attain to success through the<br>severe penances they practise. O highly blessed one, do thou hear, from<br>the beginning, what the duties are of those righteous Rishis that are<br>conversant with every duty and that are known by the name of Phenapas.<br>The Grandsire Brahma (during the days he devoted to the observance of<br>penances) drank some nectar (in the form of water). That water had flowed<br>in heaven from a great sacrifice. The froth of that water is highly<br>auspicious and (in consequence of Brahma's having drunk it) it partook of<br>His own nature. Those Rishis that subsist upon the measure of froth that<br>thus issued (from the water indicated) are called Phenapas<br>(Froth-eaters). Even this is the conduct of those pure-souled Rishis, O<br>lady, possessed of wealth of penances! Listen now to me as I explain to<br>thee who the Valkhilyas are. The Valkhilyas are ascetics that have won<br>success by their penances. They reside in the solar disc. Adopting the<br>means of subsistence that is followed by the birds, those Rishis,<br>conversant with every duty of righteousness, live according to the Unchha<br>mode. Their attire consists of deer-skins or barks of trees. Freed from<br>every pair of opposites, the Valkhilyas, possessed of wealth of penances,<br>walk in this track of righteousness. They are as big as a digit of the<br>thumb. Distributed into classes, each class lives in the practice of the<br>duties assigned to it. They desire only to practise penance. The merits<br>they win by their righteous conduct are very high. They are regarded as<br>having attained to an equality with the gods and exist for the<br>accomplishment of the purposes of the gods. Having burnt off all their<br>sins by severe penances, they blaze forth in effulgence, illuminating all<br>the points of the compass. Others, called Chakracharas, are endued with<br>cleansed souls and devoted to the practice of compassion. Righteous in<br>their conduct and possessed of great sanctity, they live in the region of<br>Soma. Thus residing near enough to the region of the Pitris, they duly<br>subsist by drinking the rays of Soma. There are others called<br>Samprakshalas and Asmkuttas and Dantolukhalas.[564] These live near the<br>Soma-drinking deities and others that drink flames of fire. With their<br>wedded spouses, and with passions under complete control, they too<br>subsist upon the rays of Soma. They pour libations of clarified butter on<br>the sacred fire, and adore the Pitris under proper forms. They also<br>perform the well-known sacrifices. Even this is said to constitute their<br>religion. The religion of the Rishis, O goddess, is always observed by<br>those who are houseless and who are free to rove through every region<br>including that of the gods. There are, again, other classes about whom I<br>shall speak presently. Do thou listen. It is necessary that they who<br>observe the different religions of the Rishis, should subjugate their<br>passions and know the Soul. Indeed, in my opinion, lust and wrath should<br>be completely conquered. With corn (wealth) acquired by the Unchha mode,<br>they should discharge the following duties, viz., the pouring of<br>libations on the sacred fire, occupying a fixed seat employing oneself<br>the while in the sacrifice called Dharmaratri, performance of she<br>Soma-sacrifice, acquisition of especial knowledge, the giving of<br>sacrificial presents which forms the fifth, the daily performance of<br>sacrifices, devotion to the worship of the Pitris and the deities,<br>hospitality towards all. Abstention from all luxurious viands prepared<br>from cow's milk, taking a pleasure in tranquillity of heart, lying on<br>bare rocks or the earth, devotion to Yoga, eating potherbs and leaves of<br>trees, and subsisting upon fruits and roots and wind and water and moss,<br>are some of the practices of the Rishis by which they attain to the end<br>that belongs to persons unsubjugated (by the world). When the smoke has<br>ceased to curl upwards from a house, when the husking machine has ceased<br>to ply, when the hearth-fire has been extinguished, when all the inmates<br>have taken their food, when dishes are no longer carried from room to<br>room, when mendicants have ceased to walk the streets, it is then that<br>the man who is devoted to the religion of truth and tranquillity of soul,<br>desiring to have a guest (but finding his desire ungratified), should eat<br>what remnant of food may still occur in the house. By acting in this way,<br>one becomes a practiser of the religion of the Munis. One should not be<br>arrogant, nor proud, nor cheerless and discontented; nor should one<br>wonder at anything. Indeed, one should behave equally towards friends and<br>foes. Verily, one who is the foremost of all persons conversant with<br>duties should also be friendly towards all creatures."
