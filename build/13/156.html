                            "Bhishma said, 'Thus addressed, Arjuna remained silent. The god of wind<br>once more addressed him, saying, 'Hear me, O foremost one of the<br>Haihayas, as I narrate to thee the achievement of the high-souled Atri.<br>Once on a time as the gods and Danavas were fighting each other in the<br>dark, Rahu pierced both Surya and Soma with his arrows. The gods,<br>overwhelmed by darkness, began to fall before the mighty Danavas, O<br>foremost of kings! Repeatedly struck by the Asuras, the denizens of<br>heaven began to lose their strength. They then beheld the learned<br>Brahmana Atri, endued with wealth of penances, engaged in the observance<br>of austerities. Addressing that Rishi who had conquered all his senses<br>and in whom wrath had been extinguished, they said 'Behold, O Rishi,<br>these two, viz., Soma and Surya, who have both been pierced by the Asuras<br>with their arrows! In consequence of this, darkness has overtaken us, and<br>we are being struck down by the foe. We do not see the end of our<br>troubles! Do thou, O lord of great puissance, rescue us from this great<br>fear.'<br><br>"The Rishi said, 'How, indeed, shall I protect you? They answered,<br>saying, 'Do thou thyself become Chandramas. Do thou also become the sun,<br>and do thou begin to slay these robbers!' Thus solicited by them, Atri<br>assumed the form of the darkness-destroying Soma. Indeed, in consequence<br>of his agreeable disposition, he began to look as handsome and delightful<br>as Soma himself. Beholding that the real Soma and the real Surya had<br>become darkened by the shafts of the foe, Atri, assuming the forms of<br>those luminaries, began to shine forth in splendour over the field of<br>battle, aided by the puissance of his penances. Verily Atri made the<br>universe blaze forth in light, dispelling all its darkness. By putting<br>forth his puissance, he also subjugated the vast multitudes of those<br>enemies of the deities. Beholding those great Asuras burnt by Atri, the<br>gods also, protected by Atri's energy, began to despatch them quickly.<br>Putting forth his prowess and mastering all his energy, it was even in<br>this way that Atri illumined the god of day, rescued the deities, and<br>slew the Asuras! Even this was the feat that regenerate one, aided by his<br>sacred fire,&#8212;that silent reciter of Mantras, that one clad in<br>deer-skins,&#8212;accomplished! Behold, O royal sage, that act achieved by<br>that Rishi who subsisted upon fruits only! I have thus narrated to thee,<br>in detail, the feat of the high-souled Atri. Shall I go on! Or, will you<br>say anything? Is there a Kshatriya that is superior to this regenerate<br>Rishi?'<br><br>"Thus addressed, Arjuna remained silent. The god of wind once more spake<br>unto him, 'Hear, O king, the feat achieved by the high-souled Chyavana<br>(in days of old). Having passed his promise to the twin Aswins, Chyavana<br>addressed the chastiser of Paka, saying, 'Do thou make the Aswins<br>drinkers of Soma with all other deities!'<br><br>"Indra said, 'The Aswins have been cast away by us. How then, can they be<br>admitted into the sacrificial circle for drinking Soma with the others?<br>They are not numbered with the deities. Do not, therefore, tell us so! O<br>thou of great vows, we do not wish to drink Soma in the company of the As<br>wins. Whatever other behest thou mayst be pleased to utter, O learned<br>Brahmana, we are ready to accomplish.'<br><br>"Chyavana said, 'The twin Aswins shall drink Soma with all of you! Both<br>of them are gods, O chief of the deities, for they are the sons of Surya.<br>Let the gods do what I have said. By acting according to those words, the<br>gods will reap great advantage. By acting otherwise, evil will overtake<br>them.'<br><br>"Indra said, 'I shall not, O foremost of regenerate persons, drink Soma<br>with the Aswins! Let others drink with them as they please! As regards<br>myself, I dare not do it.'<br><br>"Chyavana said, 'If, O slayer of Vala, thou wilt not obey my words, thou<br>shalt, this very day, drink Soma with them in sacrifice, compelled by me!<br><br>"The god of wind said, 'Then Chyavana, taking the Aswins with him,<br>commenced a great religious rite for their benefit. The gods all became<br>stupefied by Chyavana with his Mantras. Beholding that feat commenced by<br>Chyavana, Indra became incensed with wrath. Taking up a huge mountain he<br>ran against that Rishi. The chief of the deities was also armed with the<br>thunderbolt. Then the illustrious Chyavana, endued with penances, cast an<br>angry glance upon Indra as he advanced. Throwing a little water at him,<br>he paralysed the chief of the deities with his thunderbolt and mountain.<br>As the result of the religious rite he had commenced, he created a<br>terrible Asura hostile to Indra. Made of the libations he had poured on<br>the sacred fire, that Asura was called Mada, of mouth gaping wide. Even<br>such was the Asura that the great ascetic created with the aid of<br>Mantras. There were a thousand teeth in his mouth, extending for a<br>hundred yojanas. Of terrible mien, his fangs were two hundred yojanas in<br>length. One of his cheeks rested on the earth and the other touched the<br>heavens. Indeed, all the gods with Vasava seemed to stand at the root of<br>that great Asura's tongue, even as fishes when they enter into the wide<br>open mouth of a leviathan. While standing within the mouth of Mada, the<br>gods held a quick consultation and then addressing Indra, said, 'Do thou<br>soon bend thy head in reverence unto this regenerate personage! Freed<br>from every scruple, we shall drink Soma with the Aswins in our company!<br>Then Sakra, bowing down his head unto Chyavana, obeyed his behest. Even<br>thus did Chyavana make the Aswins drinkers of Soma with the other gods.<br>Calling back Mada, the Rishi then assigned him the acts he was to do.<br>That Mada was commanded to take up his residence in dice, in hunting, in<br>drinking, and in women. Hence, O king, those men that betake themselves<br>to these, meet with destruction, without doubt. Hence, one should always<br>cast off these faults to a great distance. Thus, O king, I have narrated<br>to thee the feat achieved by Chyavana. Shall I go on? Or, will you say<br>anything in reply? Is there a Kshatriya that is higher than the Brahmana<br>Chyavana?'"
