                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, how a poor man, desirous of<br>achieving his own good, should bear himself after having acquired the<br>status of humanity and come into this region of acts that is so difficult<br>to attain. Tell me also what is the best of all gifts, and what should be<br>given under what circumstances. Tell me, O son of Ganga, who art truly<br>deserving of honour and worship. It behoveth thee to discourse to us on<br>these mysteries.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus questioned by that famous monarch, viz.,<br>the son of Pandu, Bhishma explained (in these words) unto that king these<br>high mysteries appertaining to duty.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen to me with concentrated attention, O king, as I<br>explain to thee, O Bharata, these mysteries appertaining to duties, after<br>the same manner in which the holy Vyasa had explained them to me in days<br>of yore. This subject is a mystery to the very deities, O monarch. Yama<br>of stainless deeds, with the aid of vows well-observed and Yoga<br>meditation, had acquired the knowledge of these mysteries as the high<br>fruits of his penances.[539] What pleases what deity, what pleases the<br>Pitris, the Rishis, the Pramathas (associates of Mahadeva), the goddess<br>Sri, Chitragupta (the recording assistant of Yama), and the mighty<br>Elephants at the cardinal points of the compass, what constitutes the<br>religion of the Rishis&#8212;the religion, which has many mysteries and which<br>is productive of high fruits,&#8212;the merits of what are called great gifts,<br>and the merits that attach to all the sacrifices, he who knows these, O<br>sinless one, and knowing acts according to his knowledge, becomes freed<br>from stains if he has stains and acquires the merits indicated. Equal to<br>ten butchers is one oilman. Equal to ten oilmen is one drinker of<br>alcohol. Equal to ten drinkers of alcohol is one courtezan. Equal to ten<br>courtezans is a single (territorial) chief.[540] A great king is said to<br>be equal to half of these all. Hence, one should not accept, gifts from<br>these. On the other hand, one should attend to the science, that is<br>sacred and that has righteousness for its indications, of the aggregate<br>of three (viz., Religion, Wealth, and Pleasure). Amongst these, Wealth<br>and Pleasure are naturally attractive. Hence, one should, with<br>concentrated attention, listen to the sacred expositions of Religion (in<br>particular), for the fruits are very great of listening to the mysteries<br>of Religion. One should certainly hear every topic connected with<br>Religion as ordained by the deities themselves. In it is contained the<br>ritual in respect of the Sraddha in which have been declared the<br>mysteries connected with the Pitris. The mysteries connected with all the<br>deities have also been explained there. It comprehends the duties and<br>practices, productive of great merit, of the Rishis also, together with<br>the mysteries attaching to them. It contains an exposition of the merits<br>o f great sacrifices and those that attach to all kinds of gifts. Those<br>men who always read the scriptures bearing on these topics, those who<br>bear them properly in their mind, and he who, having listened to them,<br>follows them in practice, are all regarded to be as holy and sinless as<br>the puissant Narayana himself. The merits that attach to the gift of<br>kine, those that belong to the performance of ablutions in sacred waters,<br>those that are won by the performance of sacrifices,&#8212;all these are<br>acquired by that man who treats guests with reverence. They who listen to<br>these scriptures, they who are endued with faith, and they who have a<br>pure heart, it is well-known, conquer many regions of happiness. Those<br>righteous men who are endued with faith, become cleansed of all stains<br>and no sin can touch them. Such men always increase in righteousness and<br>succeed in attaining to heaven. Once on a time, a celestial messenger,<br>coming to the court of Indra of his own accord, but remaining invisible,<br>addressed the chief of the deities in these words, 'At the command of<br>those two deities who are the foremost of all physicians, and who are<br>endued with every desirable attribute, I have come to this place where I<br>behold human beings and Pitris and the deities assembled together. Why,<br>indeed, is sexual congress interdicted for the man who performs a Sraddha<br>and for him also who eats at a Sraddha (for the particular day)? Why are<br>three rice-balls offered separately at a Sraddha? Unto whom should the<br>first of those balls be offered? Unto whom should the second one be<br>offered? And whose has it been said is the third or remaining one? I<br>desire to know all this.' After the celestial messenger had said these<br>words connected with righteousness and duty, the deities who were seated<br>towards the east, the Pitris also, applauding that ranger of the sky,<br>began as follows.'<br><br>"The Pitris said, 'Welcome art thou, and blessings upon thee! Do thou<br>listen, O best of all rangers of the sky! The question thou hast asked is<br>a high one and fraught with deep meaning. The Pitris of that man who<br>indulges in sexual congress on the day he performs a Sraddha, or eats at<br>a Sraddha have to lie for the period of a whole month on his vital seed.<br>As regards the classification of the rice-balls offered at a Sraddha, we<br>shall explain what should be done with them one after another. The first<br>rice-ball should be conceived as thrown into the waters. The second ball<br>should be given to one of the wives to eat. The third ball should be cast<br>into the blazing fire. Even this is the ordinance that has been declared<br>in respect of the Sraddha. Even this is the ordinance that is followed in<br>practice according to the rites of religion. The Pitris of that man who<br>act according to this ordinance become gratified with him and remain<br>always cheerful. The progeny of such a man increases and inexhaustible<br>wealth always remains at his command.'<br><br>"The celestial messenger said, 'Thou hast explained the division of the<br>rice-balls and their consignment one after another to the three (viz.,<br>water, the spouse, and the blazing fire), together with the reasons<br>thereof.[541] Whom does that rice-tall which is consigned to the waters<br>reach? How does it, by being so consigned, gratify the deities and how<br>does it rescue the Pitris? The second ball is eaten by the spouse. That<br>has been laid down in ordinance. How do the Pitris of that man (whose<br>spouse eats the ball) become the eaters thereof? The last ball goes into<br>the blazing fire. How does that ball succeed in finding its way to thee,<br>or who is he unto whom it goes? I desire to bear this,&#8212;that is, what are<br>the ends attained by the rice-balls offered at Sraddhas when thus<br>disposed of by being cast into the water, given to the spouse, and thrown<br>into the blazing fire!<br><br>"The Pitris said, 'Great is this question which thou hast asked. It<br>involves a mystery and is fraught with wonder. We have been exceedingly<br>gratified with thee, O ranger of the sky! The very deities and the Munis<br>applaud acts done in honour of the Pitris. Even they do not know what the<br>certain conclusions are of the ordinances in respect of the acts done in<br>honour of the Pitris. Excepting the high souled, immortal, and excellent<br>Markandeya, that learned Brahmana of great fame, who is ever devoted to<br>the Pitris, none amongst them is conversant with the mysteries of the<br>ordinances in respect of the Pitris. Having heard from the holy Vyasa<br>what the end is of the three rice-balls offered at the Sraddha, as<br>explained by the Pitris themselves in reply to the question of the<br>celestial messenger, I shall explain the same to thee. Do thou hear, O<br>monarch, what the conclusions are with respect to the ordinances about<br>the Sraddha. Listen with rapt attention, O Bharata, to me as I explain<br>what the end is of the three rice-balls. That rice-ball which goes into<br>water is regarded as gratifying the deity of the moon. That deity, thus<br>gratified, O thou of great intelligence, gratifies in return the other<br>deities and the Pitris also with them. It has been laid down that the<br>second rice-ball should be eaten by the spouse (of the man that performs<br>the Sraddha). The Pitris, who are ever desirous of progeny, confer<br>children on the woman of the house. Listen now to me as I tell thee what<br>becomes of the rice-ball that is cast into the blazing fire. With that<br>ball the Pitris are gratified and as the result thereof they grant the<br>fruition of all wishes unto the person offering it. I have thus told thee<br>everything about the end of the three rice-balls offered at the Sraddha<br>and consigned to the three (viz., water, the spouse, and the fire). That<br>Brahmana who becomes the Ritwik at a Sraddha constitutes himself, by that<br>act, the Pitri of the person performing the Sraddha. Hence, he should<br>abstain that day from sexual intercourse with even his own spouse[542]. O<br>best of all rangers of the sky, the man who eats at Sraddha should bear<br>himself with purity for that day. By acting otherwise, one surely incurs<br>the faults I have indicated. It cannot be otherwise. Hence, the Brahmana<br>who is invited to a Sraddha for eating the offerings should eat them<br>after purifying himself by a bath and bear himself piously for that day<br>by abstaining from every kind of injury or evil. The progeny of such a<br>person multiply and he also who feeds him reaps the same reward.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'After the Pitris said so, a Rishi of austere<br>penances, named Vidyutprabha, whose form shone with splendour like that<br>of the sun, spoke. Having heard those mysteries of religion as propounded<br>by the Pitris, he addressed Sakra, saying, 'Stupefied by folly, men slay<br>numerous creatures born in the intermediate orders, such as worms and<br>ants and snakes and sheep and deer and birds. Heavy is the measure of sin<br>they incur by these acts. What, however, is the remedy? When this<br>question was asked, all the gods and Rishis endued with wealth of<br>penances and the highly blessed Pitris, applauded that ascetic.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'Thinking in one's mind of Kurukshetra and Gaya and Ganga<br>and Prabhasa and the lakes of Pushkara, one should dip one's head in<br>water. By so doing one becomes cleansed of all one's sins like Chandramas<br>freed from Rahu. One should bathe in this way for three days in<br>succession and then fast for every day. Besides this, one should touch<br>(after bathing) the back of a cow and bow one's head to her tail.<br>Vidyutprabha, after this, once more addressing Vasava, said, 'I shall<br>declare a rite that is more subtle. Listen to me, O thou of a hundred<br>sacrifices. Rubbed with the astringent powder of the hanging roots of the<br>banian and anointed with the oil of Priyangu, one should eat the<br>Shashtika paddy mixed with milk. By so doing one becomes cleansed of all<br>one's sins[543]. Listen now to another mystery unknown to many but which<br>was discovered by the Rishis with the aid of meditation. I heard it from<br>Vrihaspati while he recited it in the presence of Mahadeva. O chief of<br>the deities, do thou hear it with Rudra in thy company, O lord of Sachi!<br>If a person, ascending a mountain, stands there on one foot, with arms<br>upraised and joined together, and abstaining from food looks at a blazing<br>fire, he acquires the merits of severe penances and obtains the rewards<br>that attach to fasts. Heated by the rays of the sun, he becomes cleansed<br>of all his sins. One who acts in this way in both the summer and the<br>winter seasons, becomes freed from every sin. Cleansed of every sin, one<br>acquires a splendour of complexion for all time. Such a man blazes with<br>energy like the Sun or shines in beauty like the Moon!' After this, the<br>chief of the deities, viz., he of a hundred sacrifices, seated in the<br>midst of the gods, then sweetly addressed Vrihaspati, saying these<br>excellent words, 'O holy one, do thou duly discourse on what those<br>mysteries of religion are that are fraught with happiness to human<br>beings, and what the faults are which they commit, together with the<br>mysteries that attach to them!'<br><br>"Vrihaspati said, 'They who pass urine, facing the sun, they who do not<br>show reverence for the wind, they who do not pour libations on the<br>blazing fire, they who milk a cow whose calf is very young, moved by the<br>desire of obtaining from her as much milk as possible, commit sins. I<br>shall declare what those faults are, O lord of Sachi! Do thou listen to<br>me. The Sun, Wind, the bearer of sacrificial oblations, O Vasava, and<br>kine who are the mothers of all creatures, were created by the Self born<br>himself, for rescuing all the worlds, O Sakra! These are the deities of<br>human beings. Listen all of ye to the conclusions of religion. Those<br>wicked men and wicked women who pass urine facing the sun, live in great<br>infamy for six and eighty years. That man, O Sakra, who cherishes no<br>reverence for the wind, gets children that fall away prematurely from the<br>womb of his spouse. Those men who do not pour libations on the blazing<br>fire find that the fire, when they do ignite it for such rites as they<br>wish to perform, refuses to eat their libations[544]. Those men who drink<br>the milk of kine whose calves are very young, never get children for<br>perpetuating their races.[545] Such men see their children, die and their<br>races shrink. Even these are the consequences of the acts referred to, as<br>observed by regenerate persons venerable for age in their respective<br>races. Hence, one should always avoid that which has been interdicted,<br>and do only that which has been directed to be done, if one is desirous<br>of achieving prosperity. This that I say unto thee is very true.' After<br>the celestial preceptor had said this, the highly blessed deities, with<br>the Maruts, and the highly blessed Rishis questioned the Pitris, saying,<br>'Ye Pitris, at what acts of human beings, who are generally endued with<br>little understanding, do ye become gratified? What gifts, made in course<br>of such rites as are gone through for improving the position of deceased<br>persons in the other world, become inexhaustible in respect of their<br>efficacy?[546] By performing what acts can men become freed from the debt<br>they owe to the Pitris? We desire to hear this. Great is the curiosity we<br>feel.'<br><br>"The Pitris said, 'Ye highly blessed ones, the doubt existing in your<br>minds has been properly propounded. Listen as we declare what those acts<br>are of righteous men that gratify us. Bulls endued with blue complexion<br>should be set free. Gifts should be made to us, on the day of the new<br>moon, of sesame seeds and water. In the season of rains, lamps should be<br>lighted. By these acts of men, they can free themselves from the debt<br>they owe to the Pitris.[547] Such gifts never become vain. On the other<br>hand, they become inexhaustible and productive of high fruits. The<br>gratification we derive from them is regarded to be inexhaustible. Those<br>men who, endued with faith, beget offspring, rescue their deceased<br>ancestors from miserable Hell'. Hearing these words of the Pitris,<br>Vriddha-Gargya, possessed of wealth of penances and high energy, became<br>filled with wonder so that the hair on his body stood erect. Addressing<br>them he said, 'Ye that are all possessed of wealth of penances, tell us.<br>what the merits are that attach to the setting free of bulls endued with<br>blue complexion. What merits, again, attach to the gift of lamps in the<br>season of rains and the gift of water with sesame seeds?'<br><br>"The Pitris said, 'If a bull of blue complexion, upon being set free,<br>raises a (small) quantity of water with its tail, the Pitris (of the<br>person that has set that bull free) become gratified with that water for<br>full sixty thousand years. The mud such a bull raises with its horns from<br>the banks (of a river or lake), succeeds, without doubt, in sending the<br>Pitris (of the person that sets the animal free) to the region of Soma.<br>By giving lamps in the season of rains, one shines with effulgence like<br>Soma himself. The man who gives lamps is never subject to the attribute<br>of Darkness. Those men who make gifts, on the day of the new moon, of<br>sesame seeds and water, mixed with honey and using a vessel of copper, O<br>thou that art possessed of wealth of penances, are regarded as duly<br>performing a Sraddha with all its mysteries. These men get children of<br>sound health and cheerful minds. The merit acquired by the giver of the<br>Pinda (to the Pitris) takes the form of the growth of his race. Verily,<br>he who performs these acts with faith, becomes freed from the debt he<br>owes to the Pitris. Even thus has been laid down the proper time for the<br>performance of the Sraddha, the ordinance in respect of the rites to be<br>observed, the proper person that should be fed at the Sraddha, and the<br>merits that attach to it. I have declared everything to thee in due<br>order.'
