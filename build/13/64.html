                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I have heard the discourse regarding the ordinance<br>about the gift of food. Do thou discourse to me now about the conjunction<br>of the planets and the stars in relation to the subject of making<br>gifts.[334]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is recited this ancient narrative of<br>the discourse between Devaki and Narada, that foremost of Rishis. Once on<br>a time when Narada of godlike feature and conversant with every duty<br>arrived at Dwaraka, Devaki asked him this question. Unto her that had<br>asked him, the celestial Rishi Narada duly answered in the following<br>words. Do thou hear as I recite them.'<br><br>"Narada said, 'By gratifying, O blessed lady, deserving Brahmanas with<br>Payasa mixed with ghee, under the constellation Krittika one attains to<br>regions of great happiness.[335] Under the constellation Rohini, one<br>should for freeing oneself from the debt one owes to the Brahmanas make<br>gift unto them of many handfuls of venison along with rice and ghee and<br>milk, and other kinds of edibles and drinks. One giving away a cow with a<br>calf under the constellation called Somadaivata (or Mrigasiras), proceeds<br>from this region of human beings to a region in heaven of great felicity.<br>One undergoing a fast and giving away Krisara mixed with sesame,<br>transcends all difficulties in the next world, including those mountains<br>with rocks sharp as razors. By making gifts, O beautiful lady, of cakes<br>and other food under the constellation Punarvasu one becomes possessed of<br>personal beauty and great fame and takes birth in one's next life in a<br>family in which there is abundance of food. Making a gift of wrought or<br>unwrought gold, under the constellation Pushya, one shines in effulgence<br>like Soma himself in regions of surrounding gloom. He who makes a gift,<br>under the constellation Aslesha, of silver of a bull, becomes freed from<br>every fear and attains to great affluence and prosperity. By making a<br>gift, under the constellation Magha, of earthen dishes filled with<br>sesame, one becomes possessed of children and animals in this world and<br>attains to felicity in the next.[336] For making gifts unto Brahmanas,<br>under the constellation called Purva-Phalguni of food mixed with Phanita<br>the giver observing a fast the while, reward is great prosperity both<br>here and hereafter.[337] By making a gift, under the constellation called<br>Uttara-Phalguni, of ghee and milk with rice called Shashthika, one<br>attains to great honours in heaven. Whatever gifts are made by men under<br>the constellation of Uttara-Phalguni produce great merit, which, again,<br>becomes inexhaustible. This is very certain. Observing a fast the while,<br>the person that makes, under the constellation Hasta, a gift of a car<br>with four elephants, attains to regions of great felicity that are<br>capable of granting the fruition of every wish. By making a gift, under<br>the constellation Chitra, of a bull and of good perfumes, one sports in<br>bliss in regions of Apsaras like the deities sporting in the woods of<br>Nandana. By making gifts of wealth under the constellation Swati, one<br>attains to such excellent regions as one desires and wins besides great<br>fame. By making gifts, under constellation Visakha, of a bull, and a cow<br>that yields a copious measure of milk, a cart full of paddy, with a<br>Prasanga for covering the same, and also cloths for wear,[338] a person<br>gratifies the Pitris and the deities attains to inexhaustible merit in<br>the other world. Such a person never meets with any calamity and<br>gratifies the Pitris and the deities and attains to inexhaustible merit<br>in the other world. Such a person never meets with any calamity and<br>certainly reaches heaven. By making gifts unto the Brahmanas of whatever<br>articles they solicit, one attains to such means of subsistence as one<br>desires, and becomes rescued from hell and every calamity that visits a<br>sinner after death. This is the certain conclusion of the scriptures. By<br>making gifts, under the constellation Anuradha of embroidered cloth and<br>other vestments and of food, observing a fast the while, one becomes<br>honoured in heaven for a hundred Yugas. By making a gift under the<br>constellation Jyeshtha, of the potherb called Kalasaka with the roots,<br>one attains to great prosperity as also to such an end as is desirable.<br>By making unto Brahmanas a gift under the constellation Mula, of fruits<br>and roots, with a restrained soul, one gratifies the Pitris and attains<br>to a desirable end. By making under the constellation Purvashadha, a<br>gift, unto a Brahmana conversant with the Vedas and of good family and<br>conduct, of cups filled with curds, while one is in the observance of a<br>fast, one takes birth in one's next life in a family possessed of<br>abundant kine. One obtains the fruition of every wish, by making gifts,<br>under the constellation Uttarashadha, of jugs full of barley-water, with<br>ghee and inspissated juice of sugarcane in abundance. By making a gift<br>under the conjunction called Abhijit, of milk with honey and ghee unto<br>men of wisdom, a righteous person attains to heaven and becomes an object<br>of attention and honour there. By making under the conjunction Sravana, a<br>gift of blankets or other cloth of thick texture, one roves freely<br>through every region of felicity, riding on a white car of pure<br>resplendence. By making with a restrained soul, under the constellation<br>Dhanishtha, a gift of a vehicle with bulls yoked thereto, or heaps of<br>cloths and wealth, one at once attains to heaven in one's next life. By<br>making gifts, under the constellation Satabhisha, of perfumes with<br>Aquilaria Agallocha and sandalwood, one attains in the next world to the<br>companionship of Apsaras as also eternal perfumes of diverse kinds. By<br>making gifts, under the constellation Purva-Bhadrapada, or Rajamasha, one<br>attains to great happiness in the next life and becomes possessed of an<br>abundant stock of every kind of edibles and fruits.[339] One who makes,<br>under the constellation Uttara, a gift of mutton, gratifies the Paris by<br>such an act attains to inexhaustible merit in the next world. Unto one<br>who makes a gift, under the constellation Revati, of a cow with a vessel<br>of white copper for milking her, the cow so given away approaches in the<br>next world, ready to grant the fruition of every wish. By making a gift,<br>under the constellation Aswini, of a car with steeds yoked thereto, one<br>is born in one's next life in a family possessed of numerous elephants<br>and steeds and cars, and becomes endued with great energy. By making,<br>under the constellation Bharani, a gift unto the Brahmanas of kine and<br>sesame, one acquires in one's next life great fame and an abundance of<br>kine.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Even thus did Narada discourse unto Devaki upon the<br>subject of what gifts should be made under what constellations. Devaki<br>herself, having listened to this discourse, recited it in her turn unto<br>her daughters-in-law (viz., the spouses of Krishna).'"
