                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Do thou tell me, O grandsire, of that which is<br>regarded as the foremost of all Tirthas. Indeed, it behoveth thee to<br>expound to me what that Tirtha is which conduces to the greatest<br>purity.'[501]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Without doubt, all Tirthas are possessed of merit.<br>Listen, however, with attention to me as I tell thee what the Tirtha, the<br>cleanser, is of men endued with wisdom. Adhering to eternal Truth, one<br>should bathe in the Tirtha called Manasa, which is unfathomable (for its<br>depth), stainless, and pure, and which has Truth for its waters and the<br>understanding for its lake.[502] The fruits in the form of cleansing,<br>that one acquires by bathing in that Tirtha, are freedom from cupidity,<br>sincerity, truthfulness, mildness (of behaviour), compassion, abstention<br>from injuring any creature, self-restraint, and tranquillity. Those men<br>that are freed from attachments, that are divested of pride, that<br>transcend all pairs of opposites (such as pleasure and pain, praise and<br>blame, heat and cold, etc.), that have no spouses and children and houses<br>and gardens, etc., that are endued with purity, and that subsist upon the<br>alms given to them by others, are regarded as Tirthas. He who is<br>acquainted with the truths of all things and who is freed from the idea<br>of meum, is said to be the highest Tirtha.[503] In searching the<br>indications of purity, the gaze should ever be directed towards these<br>attributes (so that where these are present, thou mayst take purity to be<br>present, and where these are not, purity also should be concluded to be<br>not). Those persons from whose souls the attributes of Sattwa and Rajas<br>and Tamas have been washed off, they who, regardless of (external) purity<br>and impurity pursue the ends they have proposed to themselves, they who<br>have renounced everything, they who are possessed of omniscience and<br>endued with universal sight, and they who are of pure conduct, are<br>regarded as Tirthas possessing the power of cleansing. That man whose<br>limbs only are wet with water is not regarded as one that is washed. He,<br>on the other hand, is regarded as washed who has washed himself by<br>self-denial. Even such a person is said to be pure both inwardly and<br>outwardly. They who never concern themselves with what is past, they who<br>feel no attachment to acquisitions that are present, indeed, they who are<br>free from desire, are said to be possessed of the highest purity.<br>Knowledge is said to constitute the especial purity of the body. So also<br>freedom from desire, and cheerfulness of mind. Purity of conduct<br>constitutes the purity of the mind. The purity that one attains by<br>ablutions in sacred waters is regarded as inferior. Verily, that purity<br>which arises from knowledge, is regarded as the best. Those ablutions<br>which one performs with a blazing mind in the waters of the knowledge of<br>Brahma in the Tirtha called Manasa, are the true ablutions of those that<br>are conversant with Truth. That man who is possessed of true purity of<br>conduct and who is always devoted to the preservation of a proper<br>attitude towards all, indeed, he who is possessed of (pure) attributes<br>and merit, is regarded as truly pure. These that I have mentioned have<br>been said to be the Tirthas that inhere to the body. Do thou listen to me<br>as I tell thee what those sacred Tirthas are that are situate on the<br>earth also. Even as especial attributes that inhere to the body have been<br>said to be sacred, there are particular spots on earth as well, and<br>particular waters, that are regarded as sacred. By reciting the names of<br>the Tirthas, by performing ablutions there, and by offering oblations to<br>the Pitris in those places, one's sins are washed off. Verily, those men<br>whose sins are thus washed off succeed in attaining to heaven when they<br>leave this world. In consequence of their association with persons that<br>are righteous, through the especial efficacy of the earth itself of those<br>spots and of particular waters, there are certain portions of the earth<br>that have come to be regarded as sacred. The Tirthas of the mind are<br>separate and distinct from those of the earth. That person who bathes in<br>both attains to success without any delay. As strength without exertion,<br>or exertion without strength can never accomplish anything, singly, and<br>as these, when combined, can accomplish all things, even so one that<br>becomes endued with the purity that is contributed by the Tirthas in the<br>body as also by that which is contributed by the Tirthas on the earth,<br>becomes truly pure and attains to success. That purity which is derived<br>from both sources is the best.'"
