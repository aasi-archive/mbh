                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I have heard from thee, O sire, the names of those<br>kings that have ascended to heaven. O thou whose power is great in the<br>observance of the vow of truth by following the religion of gift. How<br>many kinds of gift are there that should be given? What are the fruits of<br>the several kinds of gifts respectively? For what reasons, what kinds of<br>gifts, made to what persons are productive of merits? Indeed, unto what<br>persons should what gifts be made? For what reasons are how many kinds of<br>gifts to be made? I desire to hear all this in detail.'"<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O son of Kunti, in detail to me, O sinless one as<br>I discourse on the subject of gifts. Indeed, I shall tell you, O Bharata,<br>how gifts should be made unto all the orders of men. From desire of<br>merit, from desire of profit, from fear, from free choice, and from pity,<br>gifts are made, O Bharata! Gifts, therefore, should be known to be of<br>five kinds. Listen now to the reasons for which gifts are thus<br>distributed in five classes. With mind freed from malice one should make<br>gifts unto Brahmanas, for by making gifts unto the one acquires fame here<br>and great felicity hereafter. (Such gifts are regarded as made from<br>desire of merit.) He is in the habit of making gifts; or he has already<br>made gifts to me. Hearing such words from solicitors one gives away all<br>kinds of wealth unto a particular solicitor. (Such gifts are regarded as<br>made from desire of profit.) I am not his, nor is he mine. If<br>disregarded, he may injure me. From such motives of fear even a man of<br>learning and wisdom may make gifts unto an ignorant wretch. (Such gifts<br>are regarded as made from fear.) This one is dear to me, I am also dear<br>to him. Influenced by considerations like these, a person of<br>intelligence, freely and with alacrity, make gifts unto a friend. (Such<br>gifts are regarded as made from free choice.) The person that solicits me<br>is poor. He is, again, gratified with a little. From considerations such<br>as these, one should always make gifts unto the poor, moved by pity.<br>(Gifts made from such considerations are regarded as made from pity.)<br>These are the five kinds of gift. They enhance the giver's merits and<br>fame. The Lord of all creatures (Brahman himself) has said that one<br>should always make gifts according to one's power.'"
