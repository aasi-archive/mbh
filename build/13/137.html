                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O Bharata, of the two things charity and devotion,<br>do thou condescend to tell me, O sire, which is the better in this world?<br>Do thou, by this, remove a great doubt from my mind.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Do thou, listen to me as I recite the names of the<br>princes who having been devoted to virtue, and having cleansed their<br>hearts by penances and practised gifts and other acts of piety,<br>undoubtedly attained to the different celestial regions. The Rishi Atreya<br>revered by all, attained, O monarch, to the excellent celestial regions,<br>by imparting the knowledge of the unconditional Supreme Being to his<br>pupils. King Sivi, the son of Usinara, by offering the life of his dear<br>son, for the benefit of a Brahmana, was translated from this world to<br>heaven. And Pratardana, the king of Kasi, by giving his son to a<br>Brahmana, secured to himself unique and undying fame in this as well as<br>in the other world. Rantideva, the son of Sankriti, attained to the<br>highest heaven by duly making gifts to the high-souled Vasishtha.<br>Devavriddha too went to heaven by giving a hundred-ribbed and excellent<br>golden umbrella to a Brahmana for a sacrifice. The worshipful Amvarisha<br>too has attained to the region of the gods, by making a gift of all his<br>kingdom to a Brahmana of great power. King Janamejaya of the solar race,<br>went to the highest heaven by making a gift of ear-rings, fine vehicles,<br>and cows to Brahmanas. The Royal sage Vrishadarbhi went to heaven by<br>making gifts of various jewels and beautiful houses to Brahmanas. King<br>Nimi of Vidarva, attained to heaven with his sons, friends and cattle, by<br>giving his daughter and kingdom to the high-souled Agastya. The far-famed<br>Rama, the son of Jamadagni, attained to the eternal regions, far beyond<br>his expectation, by giving lands to Brahmanas. Vasishtha, the prince of<br>Brahmanas, preserved all the creatures at a time of great drought when<br>the god Parjjanya did not bestow his grateful showers upon the earth, and<br>for this act he has secured eternal bliss for himself. Rama, the son of<br>Dasaratha, whose fame is very high in this world, attained to the eternal<br>regions by making gifts of wealth at sacrifices. The far-famed royal sage<br>Kakshasena, went to heaven by duly making over to the high-souled<br>Vasishtha the wealth which he had deposited with him. Marutta, the son of<br>Parikshita and the grandson of Karandhama, by giving his daughter in<br>marriage to Angiras, immediately went to heaven. The highly devout king<br>of Panchalal Brahmadatta, attained the blessed way by giving away a<br>precious conch-shell. King Mitrasaha, by giving his favourite wife<br>Madayanti to the high-souled Vasishtha, ascended to heaven. Sudyumna, the<br>son of Manu, by causing the proper punishment to be inflicted upon the<br>high-souled Likhita, attained to the most blessed regions. The celebrated<br>royal sage Saharachitta went to the blessed regions, by sacrificing his<br>dear life for the sake of a Brahmana. The king Satadyumna went to heaven<br>by giving to Maudgaya a golden mansion replete with all the objects of<br>desire. In ancient times, king Sumanyu by giving to Sandilya heaps of<br>food looking like a hill, proceeded to heaven. The Salwa prince Dyutimat<br>of great splendour attained to the highest regions by giving his kingdom<br>to Richika. The Royal sage Madiraswa by giving his slender-waisted<br>daughter to Hiranyahasta went to the region of the gods. The lordly<br>Lomapada attained all the vast objects of his desire by giving his<br>daughter Santa in marriage to Rishyasringa. The royal sage Bhagiratha, by<br>giving his famous daughter Hansi in marriage to Kautsa, went to the<br>eternal regions. King Bhagiratha by giving hundreds and thousands of kine<br>with their young ones to Kohala attained to the most blessed regions.<br>These and many other men, O Yudhishthira, have attained to heaven, by the<br>merit of their charities and penances and they have also returned from<br>thence again and again. Their fame will endure as long as the world will<br>last. I have related to thee, O Yudhishthira, this story of those good<br>householders who have attained to eternal regions by dint of their<br>charities and penances. By their charities and by performing sacrifices<br>and by procreating offspring, these people have attained to the heavenly<br>regions. O foremost scion of Kuru's race, by always performing acts of<br>charity, these men applied their virtuous intellects to the performance<br>of sacrifices and charities. O mighty prince, as night has approached I<br>shall explain to thee in the morning whatever doubts may arise in thy<br>mind.'"
