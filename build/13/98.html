                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Of what kind is the gift of light, O chief of<br>Bharata's race? How did this gift originate? What are the merits that<br>attach to it? Do thou tell me all this.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection, O Bharata, is recited the old<br>narrative of the discourse between Manu, that lord of creatures, and<br>Suvarna. There was in days of yore an ascetic, O Bharata, of the name of<br>Suvarna. His complexion was like that of gold and hence he was called<br>Suvarna (the gold-complexioned), Endued with a pure lineage, good<br>behaviour, and excellent accomplishments, he had mastered all the Vedas.<br>Indeed, by the accomplishments he possessed, he succeeded in surpassing<br>many persons of high lineage. One day that learned Brahmana saw Manu, the<br>lord of all creatures, and approached him. Meeting with each other, they<br>made the usual enquiries of politeness. Both of them were firm in the<br>observance of truth. They sat down on the delightful breast of Meru, gnat<br>mountain of gold. Seated there they began to converse with each other on<br>diverse subjects connected with the high-souled deities and regenerate<br>Rishis and Daityas of ancient times. Then Suvarna, addressing the<br>Self-born Menu, said these words, 'It behoveth thee to answer one<br>question of mine for the benefit of all creatures. O lord of all<br>creatures, the deities are seen to be worshipped with presents of flowers<br>and other good scents. What is this? How has this practice been<br>originated? What also are the merits that attach to it? Do thou discourse<br>to me on this topic.'"<br><br>"Manu said, 'In this connection is recited the old history of the<br>discourse between Sukra and the high-souled (Daitya) Vali. Once on a<br>time, Sukra of Bhrigu's race approached the presence of Vali, the son of<br>Virochana, while he was ruling the three worlds. The chief of the Asuras,<br>that giver of sacrificial presents in abundance, having worshipped the<br>descendant of Bhrigu with the Arghya (and offering him a seat), sat down<br>after his guest had seated himself. This very topic that thou hast<br>started relating to the merits attaching to the gift of flowers and<br>incense and lamps, came up on the occasion. Indeed, the chief of the<br>Daityas put this high question to Sukra, that most learned of all<br>ascetics.'<br><br>"Vali said, 'O foremost of all persons conversant with Brahma, what,<br>indeed, is the merit of giving flowers and incense and lamps? It behoveth<br>thee, O foremost of Brahmanas, to discourse to me on this.'<br><br>"Sukra said, 'Penance first sprang into life. Afterwards came Dharma (or<br>compassion and other virtues). In the interval between started into life<br>many creepers and herbs.[439] Innumerable were the species of those. All<br>of them have (the deity) Soma for their lord. Some of these creepers and<br>herbs came to be regarded as Amrita and some came to be regarded as<br>Poison. Others that were neither this nor that formed one class. That is<br>Amrita which gives immediate gratification and joy to the mind. That is<br>Poison which tortures the mind exceedingly by its odour. Know again that<br>Amrita is highly auspicious and that Poison is highly inauspicious. All<br>the (deciduous) herbs are Amrita. Poison is born of the energy of fire.<br>Flowers gladden the mind and confer prosperity. Hence, men of righteous<br>deeds bestowed the name Sumanas on them. That man who is in a state of<br>purity offers flowers into the deities finds that the deities become<br>gratified with him, and as the consequence of such gratification bestow<br>prosperity upon him. O ruler of the Daityas, those deities unto whom<br>worshippers offer flowers, O lord, uttering their names the while, become<br>gratified with the offers in consequence of their devotion. The<br>(deciduous) herbs are of diverse kinds and possess diverse kinds of<br>energy. They should be classed as fierce, mild, and powerful. Listen to<br>me as I tell thee which trees are useful for purposes of sacrifice and<br>which are not so. Hear also what garlands are acceptable to Asuras, and<br>what are beneficial when offered to the deities. I shall also set forth<br>in their due order what garlands are agreeable to the Rakshasas, what to<br>the Uragas, what to the Yakshas, what to human beings, and what to the<br>Pitris, in proper order. Flowers are of diverse kinds. Some are wild,<br>some are from trees that grew in the midst of human habitations; some<br>belong to trees that never grow unless planted on well-tilled soil; some<br>are from trees growing on mountains; some are from trees that are not<br>prickly; and some from trees that are prickly. Fragrance, beauty of form,<br>and taste also may offer grounds of classification. The scent that<br>flowers yield is of two kinds, agreeable and disagreeable. Those flowers<br>that emit agreeable scent should be offered to the deities. The flowers<br>of trees that are destitute of thorns are generally white in hue. Such<br>flowers are always acceptable to the deities, O lord! One possessed of<br>wisdom should offer garlands of aquatic flowers, such as the lotus and<br>the like, unto the Gandharvas and Nagas and Yakshas. Such plants and<br>herbs as produce red flowers, as are possessed of keen scent, and as are<br>prickly, have been laid down in the Atharvana as fit for all acts of<br>incantation for injuring foes. Such flowers as are possessed of keen<br>energy, as are painful to the touch, as grow on trees and plants having<br>thorns, and as are either bloody-red or black, should be offered to<br>(evil) spirits and unearthly beings. Such flowers as gladden the mind and<br>heart, as are very agreeable when pressed, and as are of beautiful form,<br>have been said, O lord, to be worthy of being offered to human beings.<br>Such flowers as grow on cemeteries and crematoria, or in places dedicated<br>to the deities, should not be brought and used for marriage and other<br>rites having growth and prosperity for their object, or for acts of<br>dalliance and pleasure in secrecy. Such flowers as are born on mountains<br>and in vales, and as are agreeable in scent and aspect, should be offered<br>unto the deities. Sprinkling them with sandal-paste, such agreeable<br>flowers should be duly offered according to the ordinances of the<br>scriptures. The deities become gratified with the scent of flowers; the<br>Yakshas and Rakshasas with their sight, the Nagas with their touch; and<br>human beings with all three, viz., scent, sight, and touch. Flowers, when<br>offered to the deities gratify them immediately. They are capable of<br>accomplishing every object by merely wishing its accomplishment. As such,<br>when gratified with devotees offering them flowers, they cause all the<br>objects cherished by their worshippers to be immediately accomplished.<br>Gratified, they gratify their worshippers. Honoured, they cause their<br>worshippers to enjoy all honours. Disregarded and insulted, they cause<br>those vilest of men to be ruined and consumed. I shall, after this, speak<br>to thee of the merits that attach to the ordinances about the gift of<br>incense. Know, O prince of Asuras, that incenses are of diverse kinds.<br>Some of them are auspicious and some in-auspicious. Some incenses consist<br>of exudations. Some are made of fragrant wood set on fire. And some are<br>artificial, being made by the hand, of diverse articles mixed together.<br>Their scent is of two kinds, viz., agreeable and disagreeable. Listen to<br>me as I discourse on the subject in detail.[440] All exudations except<br>that of the Boswellia serrata are agreeable to the deities. It is,<br>however, certain that the best of all exudations is that of the<br>Balsamodendron Mukul. Of all Dhupas of the Sari class, the Aquilaria<br>Agallocha is the best. It is very agreeable to the Yakshas, the<br>Rakshasas, and Nagas. The exudation of the Boswellia serrata, and others<br>of the same class, are much desired by the Daityas. Dhupas made of the<br>exudation of the Shorea robusta and the Pinus deodara, mixed with various<br>spirits of strong scent, are, O king, ordained for human beings. Such<br>Dhupas are said to immediately gratify the deities, the Danavas, and<br>spirits. Besides these, there are many other kinds of Dhupas used by men<br>of purposes of pleasure or enjoyment. All the merits that have been<br>spoken of as attaching to the offer of flowers should be known equally to<br>attach to the gift of such Dhupas as are productive of gratification. I<br>shall now speak of the merits that attach to the gift of lights, and who<br>may give them at what time and in what manner, and what should be the<br>kind of lights that should be offered. Light is said to be energy and<br>fame and has an upward motion. Hence the gift of light, which is energy,<br>enhances the energy of men[441]. There is a hell of the name of<br>Andhatamas. The period also of the sun's southward course is regarded as<br>dark. For escaping that hell and the darkness of this period, one should<br>give lights during the period when the sun is in his northward course.<br>Such an act is applauded by the good.[442] Since, again, light has an<br>upward course and is regarded as a remedy for darkness, therefore, one<br>should be a giver of light. Even this is the conclusion of the<br>scriptures. It is owing to the lights offered that the deities have<br>become endued with beauty, energy, and resplendence. By abstention from<br>such an act, the Rakshasas have become, endued with the opposite<br>attributes. Hence, one should always give lights. By giving lights a man<br>becomes endued with keen vision and resplendence One that gives lights<br>should not be an object of jealousy with others. Lights, again, should<br>not be stolen, nor extinguished when given by others. One that steals a<br>light becomes blind. Such a man has to grope through darkness (in the<br>next world) and becomes destitute of resplendence. One that gives lights<br>shines in beauty in the celestial regions like a row of lights. Among<br>lights, the best are those in which ghee is burnt. Next in order are<br>those in which the juice of (the fruits yielded by) deciduous herbs is<br>burnt. One desirous of advancement and growth should never burn (for<br>light) fat or marrow or the juice that flows from the bones of<br>creatures.[443] The man who desires his own advancement and prosperity<br>should always give lights at descents from mountains, in roads through<br>forests and inaccessible regions, under sacred trees standing in the<br>midst of human habitations, and in crossings of streets. The man who<br>gives lights always illumines his race, attains to purity of soul and<br>effulgence of form. Verily, such a man, after death, attains to the<br>companionship of the luminous bodies in the firmament. I shall now<br>discourse to thee upon the merits, with the fruits they bring about, that<br>attach to Vali offerings made to the deities, the Yakshas, the Uragas,<br>human beings, spirits, and Rakshasas. Those unscrupulous and wicked men<br>that eat without first serving Brahmanas and deities and guests and<br>children, should be known as Rakshasas. Hence, one should first offer the<br>food one has got ready unto the deities after having worshipped them duly<br>with restrained senses and concentrated attention. One should offer the<br>Vali unto the deities, bending one head in reverence. The deities are<br>always supported by food that householders offer. Verily, they bless such<br>houses in which offerings are made to them. The Yakshas and Rakshasas and<br>Pannagas, as also guests and all homeless persons, are supported by the<br>food that are offered by persons leading the domestic mode of life,<br>Indeed, the deities and the Pitris derive their sustenance from such<br>offerings. Gratified with such offerings they gratify the offerer in<br>return with longevity and fame and wealth. Clean food, of agreeable scent<br>and appearance, mixed with milk and curds, should, along with flowers, be<br>offered to the deities. The Valis that should be offered to Yakshas and<br>Rakshasas should be rich with blood and meat, with wines and spirits<br>accompanying, and adorned with coatings of fried paddy.[444] Valis mixed<br>with lotuses and Utpalas are very agreeable to the Nagas. Sesame seeds,<br>boiled in raw sugar, should be offered to the spirits and other unearthly<br>Beings. He who never takes any food without first serving therefrom the<br>Brahmanas and deities and guests, becomes entitled to first portions of<br>food. Such a man becomes endued with strength and energy. Hence, one<br>should never take any food without first offering a portion thereof to<br>the deities after worshipping them with reverence. One's house always<br>blazes forth with beauty in consequence of the household deities that<br>live in it. Hence, he that desires his own advancement and prosperity<br>should worship the household deities by offering them the first portion<br>of every food. Even thus did the learned Kavi of Bhrigu's race discourse<br>to Vali, the chief of the Asuras. That discourse was next recited by Manu<br>unto the Rishi Suvarna, Suvarna, in his turn, recited it to Narada. The<br>celestial Rishi Narada recited unto me the merits that attach to the<br>several acts mentioned. Informed of those merits, do thou, O son, perform<br>the several acts mentioned!'"
