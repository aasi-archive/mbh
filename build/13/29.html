                            "Bhishma said, 'Thus advised by Indra, Matanga, observant of vows,<br>refused, to hear what he was bid. On the other hand, with regulated vows<br>and cleansed soul, he practised austere penances by standing on one foot<br>for a thousand years, and was deeply engaged in Yoga-meditation. After a<br>thousand years had passed away, Sakra once more came to see him. Indeed,<br>the slayer of Vala and Vritra said unto him the same words.'<br><br>'Matanga said, 'I have passed these thousand years, standing on one foot,<br>in deep meditation, observing of the vow of Brahmacharyya. Why is it that<br>I have not yet succeeded in acquiring the status of a Brahmana?'<br><br>'Sakra said, 'One born on a Chandala cannot, by any means acquire the<br>status of a Brahmana. Do thou, therefore name some boon so that all this<br>labour of thine may not prove fruitless&#8212;Thus addressed by the chief of<br>the celestials, Matanga became filled with grief. He repaired to Prayaga,<br>and passed there a hundred years, standing all the while on his toes. In<br>consequence of the observance of such Yoga which was extremely difficult<br>to bear, he became very much emaciated and his arteries and veins became<br>swollen and visible. He was reduced to only skin and bones. Indeed, it<br>has been heard by us that the righteous-souled Matanga, while practising<br>those austerities at Gaya, dropped down on the ground from sheer<br>exhaustion. The lord and giver of boons, engaged in the good of all<br>creatures, viz., Vasava beholding him falling down, quickly came to that<br>spot and held him fast.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'It seems, O Matanga, that the status of a Brahmana which<br>thou seekest is ill-suited to thee. That status is incapable of being<br>attained by thee. Verily, in thy case, it is surrounded by many dangers.<br>A person by worshipping a Brahmana obtains happiness; while by abstaining<br>from such worship, he obtains grief and misery. The Brahmana is, with<br>respect to all creatures, the giver of what they prize or covet and the<br>protector of what they already have. It is through the Brahmanas that the<br>Pitris and the deities become gratified. The Brahmana, O Matanga, is said<br>to be foremost of all created Beings. The Brahmana grants all objects<br>that are desired and in the way they are desired?[248] Wandering through<br>innumerable orders of Being and undergoing repeated rebirths, one<br>succeeds in some subsequent birth in acquiring the status of a Brahmana.<br>That status is really incapable of being obtained by persons of<br>uncleansed souls. Do thou, therefore, give up the idea. Do thou name some<br>other boon. The particular boon which thou seekest is incapable of being<br>granted to thee.'<br><br>"Matanga said, 'Afflicted as I am with grief, why, O Sakra, dost thou<br>afflict me further (with such speeches as these)? Thou art striking one<br>that is already dead, by this behaviour. I do not pity thee for having<br>acquired the status of a Brahmana thou now failest to retain it (for thou<br>hast no compassion to show for one like me). O thou of a hundred<br>sacrifices, the status of a Brahmana as thou sayest be really<br>unattainable by any of the three other orders, yet, men that have<br>succeeded in acquiring (through natural means) that high status do not<br>adhere to it (for what sins do net even Brahmanas commit). Those who<br>having acquired the status of a Brahmana that, like affluence, is so<br>difficult to acquire, do not seek to keep it up (by practising the<br>necessary duties), must be regarded to be the lowest of wretches in this<br>world. Indeed, they are the most sinful of all creatures. Without doubt,<br>the status of a Brahmana is exceedingly difficult to attain, and once<br>being attained, it is difficult to maintain it. It is capable of<br>dispelling every kind of grief. Alas, having attained to it, men do not<br>always seek to keep it up (by practising righteousness and the other<br>duties that attach to it). When even such persons are regarded as<br>Brahmanas why is it that I, who am contented with my own self, who am<br>above all couples of opposites, who am dissociated from all worldly<br>objects, who am observant of the duty of compassion towards all creatures<br>and of self-restraint of conduct, should not be regarded as deserving of<br>that status.[249] How unfortunate I am, O Purandara, that through the<br>fault of my mother I have been reduced to this condition, although I am<br>not unrighteous in my behaviour? Without doubt, Destiny is incapable of<br>being warded off or conquered by individual exertion, since, O lord, I am<br>unable to acquire, notwithstanding these persistent efforts of mine, the<br>object, upon the acquisition of which I have set my heart. When such is<br>the case, O righteous one, it behoves thee to grant me some other boon<br>if, indeed, I have become worthy of thy grace or if I have a little of<br>merit.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The slayer of Vala and Vritra then said unto<br>him,&#8212;Do thou name the boon.&#8212;Thus urged by the great Indra, Matanga said<br>the following words:<br><br>"Matanga said, 'Let me be possessed of the power of assuming any form at<br>will, and journeying through the skies and let me enjoy whatever<br>pleasures I may set my heart upon. And let me also have the willing<br>adorations of both Brahmanas and Kshatriyas. I bow to thee by bending my<br>head, O god. It behoveth thee to do that also by which my fame, O<br>Purandara, May live for ever in the world.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'Thou shalt be celebrated as the deity of a particular<br>measure of verse and thou shalt obtain the worship of all woman. Thy<br>fame, O son, shall become unrivalled in the three worlds.'&#8212;Having<br>granted him these boons, Vasava disappeared there and then. Matanga also,<br>casting off his life-breaths, attained to a high place. Thou mayst thus<br>see, O Bharata, that the status of a Brahmana is very high. That status<br>is incapable of being acquired here (except in the natural way of birth)<br>as said by the great Indra himself.'
