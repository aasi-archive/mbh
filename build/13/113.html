                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Abstention from injury, the observance of the Vedic<br>ritual, meditation, subjugation of the senses, penances, and obedient<br>services rendered to the preceptors,&#8212;which amongst these is fraught with<br>the greatest merit with respect to a person?'<br><br>"Vrihaspati said, All these six are fraught with merit. They are<br>different doors of piety. I shall discourse upon them presently. Do thou<br>listen to them, O chief of the Bharatas! I shall tell thee what<br>constitutes the highest good of a human being. That man who practises the<br>religion of universal compassion achieves his highest good. That man who<br>keeps under control the three faults, viz., lust, wrath, and cupidity, by<br>throwing them upon all creatures (and practises the virtue of<br>compassion), attains to success[519]. He who, from motives of his own<br>happiness, slays other harmless creatures with the rod of chastisement,<br>never attains to happiness, in the next world. That man who regards all<br>creatures as his own self, and behaves towards them as towards his own<br>self, laying aside the rod of chastisement and completely subjugating his<br>wrath, succeeds in attaining to happiness. The very deities, who are<br>desirous of a fixed abode, become stupefied in ascertaining the track of<br>that person who constitutes himself the soul of all creatures and looks<br>upon them all as his own self, for such a person leaves no track<br>behind.[520] One should never do that to another which one regards as<br>injurious to one's own self. This, in brief, is the rule of<br>Righteousness. One by acting in a different way by yielding to desire,<br>becomes guilty of unrighteousness. In refusals and gifts, in happiness<br>and misery, in the agreeable, and the disagreeable, one should judge of<br>their effects by a reference to one's own self.[521] When One injures<br>another, the injured turns round and injures the injurer. Similarly, when<br>one cherishes another, that other cherishes the cherisher. One should<br>frame one's rule of conduct according to this. I have told thee what<br>Righteousness is even by this subtile way.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The preceptor of the deities, possessed of<br>great intelligence, having said this unto king Yudhishthira the just,<br>ascended upwards for proceeding to Heaven, before our eyes.'"
