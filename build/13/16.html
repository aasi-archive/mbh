                            "Upamanyu said, 'There was in the Krita age, O sire, a Rishi celebrated<br>under the name of Tandi. With great devotion of heart he adored, with the<br>aid of Yoga-meditation, the great God for ten thousand years. Listen to<br>me as I tell thee fruit or reward he reaped of such extraordinary<br>devotion. He succeeded in beholding Mahadeva and praised him by uttering<br>some hymns. Thinking, with the aid of his penances, of Him who is the<br>supreme Soul and who is immutable and undeteriorating, Tandi became<br>filled with wonder, and said these words,&#8212;I seek the protection of Him<br>whom the Sankhyas describe and the Yogins think of as the Supreme, the<br>Foremost, the Purusha, the pervader of all things, and the Master of all<br>existent objects, of him who, the learned say, is the cause of both the<br>creation and the destruction of the universe; of him who is superior to<br>all the celestials, the Asuras, and the Munis, of him who has nothing<br>higher, who is unborn, who is the Lord of all things, who has neither<br>beginning nor end, and who is endued with supreme puissance, who is<br>possessed of the highest felicity, and who is effulgent and<br>sinless.&#8212;After he had said these words, Tandi beheld before him that<br>ocean of penances, that great Deity who is immutable and undeteriorating,<br>who is without compare, who is inconceivable, who is eternal, and who is<br>without any change, who is indivisible, who is whole, who is Brahma, who<br>transcends all attributes, and who is endued with attributes, who is the<br>highest delight of Yogins, who is without deterioration, who is called<br>Emancipation, who is the refuge of the Mind, of Indra, of Agni, of the<br>god of wind, of the entire universe, and of the Grandsire Brahma; who is<br>incapable of being conceived by the Mind, who is without mutation of any<br>kind, who is pure, who is capable of being apprehended by understanding<br>only and who is immaterial as the Mind; who is difficult of<br>comprehension, who is incapable of being measured, who is difficult of<br>being attained by persons of uncleansed souls, who is the origin of the<br>universe, and who transcends both the universe and the attribute of<br>darkness; who is ancient, who is Purusha, who is possessed of effulgence,<br>and who is higher than the highest. The Rishi Tandin, desirous of<br>beholding Him who making himself endued with life-breaths, resides in<br>what results from it viz., Jiva, in the form of that effulgence which is<br>called the Mind, passed many years in the practice of the severest<br>austerities, and having succeeded in beholding Him as the reward of those<br>penances, he praised the great God in the following terms.'<br><br>"Tandi said, 'Thou art the holiest of holies[77] and the refuge of all, O<br>foremost of all beings endued with intelligence. Thou art the fiercest<br>energy of all kinds of energy. Thou art the austerest penance of all<br>penances. Thou, O puissant one, art the liberal giver of blessings. Thou<br>art the supreme Truth. Salutations to thee, O thou of a thousand rays,<br>and, O refuge of all felicity. Thou art the giver of that Nirvana which,<br>O puissant one, Yatis, standing in fear of birth and death, strive for so<br>hard. The Grandsire Brahma, he of a hundred sacrifices, (viz., Indra)<br>Vishnu, the Viswadevas, the great Rishis, are incapable of comprehending<br>thee and thy real nature. How then can persons like ourselves hope to<br>comprehend thee? From thee flows everything. Upon thee rests everything.<br>Thou art called Kala, thou art called Purusha, thou art called Brahma.<br>Celestial Rishis conversant with the Puranas, say that thou hast three<br>bodies viz., those pertaining to Kalas, those pertaining to Purusha and<br>those pertaining to Brahma or the three forms namely Brahma, Vishnu and<br>Rudra. Thou art Adhi-Purusha, (occupying the physical flame from head to<br>foot) thou art Adhyatma, thou art Adhibhuta, and Adhi-Daivata, thou art<br>Adhi-loka, Adhi-Vijnanam and Adhi-Yajna.[78] Men of wisdom, when they<br>succeed in knowing thee that residest in themselves and that art<br>incapable of being known by the very gods, become freed from all bonds<br>and pass into a state of existence that transcends all sorrow.[79] They<br>that do not wish to know thee, O thou of great puissance, have to undergo<br>innumerable births and deaths. Thou art the door of heaven and of<br>Emancipation. Thou art he that projectest all beings into existence and<br>withdrawest them again into thyself. Thou art the great giver. Thou art<br>heaven, thou art Emancipation, thou art desire (the seed of action). Thou<br>art wrath that inspires creatures. Thou art Sattwa, thou art Rajas, thou<br>art Tamas, thou art the nether regions, and thou art the upper regions.<br>Thou art the Grandsire Brahma, thou art Bhava, thou art Vishnu, thou art<br>Skanda, thou art Indra, thou art Savitri, thou art Yama, thou art Varuna,<br>Soma, thou art Dhatri, thou art Manu, thou art Vidhatri and thou art<br>Kuvera, the Lord of treasures. Thou art Earth, thou art Wind, thou art<br>Water, thou art Agni, thou art Space, thou art Speech, thou art the<br>Understanding, thou art Steadiness, thou art Intelligence, thou art the<br>acts that creatures do, thou art Truth, thou art Falsehood, thou art<br>existent and thou art non-existent. Thou art the senses, thou art that<br>which transcends Prakriti, thou art immutable. Thou art superior to the<br>universe of existent objects, thou art superior to the universe of<br>non-existent objects, thou art capable of being conceived, thou art<br>incapable of being conceived. That which is supreme Brahman, that which<br>is the highest entity, that which is the end of both the Sankhyas and the<br>Yogins, is, without doubt, identical with thee. Verily, rewarded have I<br>been today by thee in consequence of thy granting me a sight of thy form.<br>I have attained the end which the righteous alone attain to. I have been<br>rewarded with that end which is solicited by persons whose understandings<br>have been cleansed by Knowledge. Alas, so long I was steeped in<br>Ignorance; for this long period I was a senseless fool, since I had no<br>knowledge of thee that art the Supreme Deity, thee that art the only<br>eternal Entity as can be only known by all persons endued with wisdom. In<br>course of innumerable lives have I at last succeeded in acquiring that<br>Devotion towards thee in consequence of which thou hast shown thyself to<br>me. O thou that art ever inclined to extend thy grace to those that are<br>devoted to thee. He that succeeds in knowing thee is enable to enjoy<br>immortality. Thou art that which is ever a mystery with the gods, the<br>Asuras, and the ascetics. Brahman is concealed in the cave of the heart.<br>The very ascetics are unable to behold or know Him.[80] Thou art that<br>puissant deity who is the doer of everything and whose face is turned<br>towards every direction. Thou art the Soul of all things, thou seest all<br>things, thou pervadest all things, and thou knowest all things. Thou<br>makest a body for thyself, and bearest that body. Thou art an embodied<br>Being. Thou enjoyest a body, and thou art the refuge of all embodied<br>creatures. Thou art the creator of the life-breaths, thou possessest the<br>life-breaths, thou art one that is endued with life-breaths, thou art the<br>giver of the life-breaths, and thou art the refuge of all beings endued<br>with life-breaths. Thou art that Adhyatma which is the refuge of all<br>righteous persons that are devoted to Yoga-meditation and conversant with<br>the Soul and that are solicitous of avoiding rebirth. Verily, thou art<br>that Supreme Lord who is identical with that refuge. Thou art the giver<br>unto all creatures of whatever ends become theirs, fraught with happiness<br>or misery. Thou art he that ordains all created beings to birth and<br>death. Thou art the puissant Lord who grants success to Rishis crowned<br>with success in respect of the fruition of their wishes. Having created<br>all the worlds beginning with Bhu, together with all the denizens of<br>heaven, that upholdest and cherishest them all, distributing thyself into<br>thy well-known forms numbering Eight.[81] From thee flows everything.<br>Upon thee rests all things. All things, again, disappear in thee. Thou<br>art the sole object that is Eternal. Thou art that region of Truth which<br>is sought by the righteous and regarded by them as the highest. Thou art<br>that cessation of individual existence which Yogins seek. Thou art that<br>Oneness which is sought by persons conversant with the soul. Brahma and<br>the Siddhas expounding the mantras have concealed thee in a cave for<br>preventing the deities and Asuras and human beings from beholding<br>thee.[82] Although thou residest in the heart, yet thou are concealed.<br>Hence, stupefied by thee, deities and Asuras and human beings are all<br>unable to understand thee, O Bhava, truly and in all thy details. Unto<br>those persons that succeed in attaining to thee after having cleansed<br>themselves by devotion, thou showest thyself of thy own accord, O thou<br>that residest in all hearts.[83] By knowing thee one can avoid both death<br>and rebirth. Thou art the highest object of knowledge. By knowing thee no<br>higher object remains for one to know. Thou art the greatest object of<br>acquisition. The person that is truly wise, by acquiring thee, thinks<br>that there is no higher object to acquire. By attaining to thee that art<br>exceedingly subtile and that art the highest object of acquisition, the<br>man of wisdom becomes immortal and immutable. The followers of the<br>Sankhya system, well conversant with their own philosophy and possessing<br>a knowledge of the attributes (of Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas) and of those<br>called the topics of enquiry,&#8212;those learned men who transcend the<br>destructible by attaining to a knowledge of the subtile or<br>indestructible&#8212;succeed, by knowing thee, in freeing themselves from all<br>bonds. Persons conversant with the Vedas regard thee as the one object of<br>knowledge, which has been expounded in the Vedantas. These men, devoted<br>to the regulation of the breaths, always meditate on thee and at last<br>enter into thee as their highest end. Riding on the car made of Om, those<br>men enter into Maheswara. Of that which is called the Devayana (the path<br>of the deities) thou art the door called Aditya. Thou art again, the<br>door, called Chandramas, of that which is called the Pitriyana (the path<br>of the Pitris).[84] Thou art Kashtha, thou art the points of the horizon,<br>thou art the year, and thou art the Yugas. Thine is the sovereignty of<br>the heavens, thine is the sovereignty of the Earth, thou art the Northern<br>and the Southern declensions. The Grandsire Brahma in days of yore<br>uttered thy praises, O thou that art called Nilarohita (blue and red), by<br>reciting diverse hymns and urged thee to create living creatures.<br>Brahmanas conversant with Richs praise thee by uttering Richs, regarding<br>thee as unattached to all things and as divested of all forms. Adhyaryus,<br>in sacrifices, pour libations, uttering Yajushes the while, in honour of<br>thee that art the sole object of knowledge, according to the three<br>well-known ways.[85] Persons of cleansed understandings, that are<br>conversant with Samans, sing thee with the aid of Samans. Those<br>regenerate persons, again, that are conversant with the Atharvans, hymn<br>thee as Rita, as Truth, as the Highest, and as Brahma. Thou art the<br>highest cause, whence Sacrifice has flowed. Thou art the Lord, and thou<br>art Supreme. The night and day are thy sense of hearing and sense of<br>sight. The fortnights and months are thy head and arms. The seasons are<br>thy energy, penances are thy patience, and the year is thy anus, thighs<br>and feet. Thou art Mrityu. thou art Yama, thou art Hutasana, thou art<br>Kala, thou art endued with speed in respect of destruction, thou art the<br>original cause of Time, and thou art eternal Time. Thou art Chandramas<br>and Aditya. with all the stars and planets and the atmosphere that fills<br>space. Thou art the pole-star, thou art constellation called the seven<br>Rishis, thou art the seven regions beginning with Bhu. Thou art Pradhana<br>and Mahat, thou art Unmanifest, and thou art this world. Thou art the<br>universe beginning with Brahman and ending with the lowest forms of<br>vegetation. Thou art the beginning or original cause of all creatures.<br>Thou art the eight Prakritis.[86] Thou art, again, above the eight<br>Prakritis. Everything that exists, represents a portion of thy divine<br>Self. Thou art that supreme Felicity which is also Eternal. Thou art the<br>end which is attained to by all things. Thou art that highest existence<br>which is sought for by the Righteous. Thou art that state which is freed<br>from every anxiety. Thou art eternal Brahman! Thou art that highest state<br>which constitutes the meditation of persons learned in the scriptures and<br>the Vedangas. Thou art the highest Kashtha, thou art the highest Kala.<br>Thou art the highest Success, and thou art the highest Refuge. Thou art<br>the highest Tranquillity. Thou art the highest cessation of Existence. By<br>attaining to thee, Yogins think that they attain to the highest success<br>that is open to them. Thou art Contentment, thou art Success, thou art<br>the Sruti, and thou art the Smriti. Thou art that Refuge of the Soul<br>after which Yogins strive, and thou art that indestructible Prapti which<br>men of Knowledge pursue. Thou art, without doubt, that End which those<br>persons have in view that are habituated to sacrifices and that pour<br>sacrificial libations, impelled by specific desires, and that make large<br>presents on such occasions. Thou art that high End which is sought for by<br>persons that waste and scorch their bodies with severe penances with<br>ceaseless recitations, with those rigid vows and fasts that appertain to<br>their tranquil lives, and with other means of self-affliction. O Eternal<br>one, thou art that End which is theirs that are unattached to all things<br>and that have relinquished all acts. Thou, O Eternal one, art that End<br>which is theirs that are desirous of achieving Emancipation from rebirth,<br>that live in dissociation from all enjoyments, and that desire the<br>annihilation of the Prakriti elements. Thou art that high End, O<br>illustrious one, which is indescribable, which is stainless, which is the<br>immutable one, and which is theirs that are devoted to knowledge and<br>science. These are the live Ends that have been declared in the Vedas and<br>the Scriptures and the Puranas. It is through thy grace that persons<br>attain to those Ends, or, if they fail to attain to them, it is through<br>thy grace being denied to them.&#8212;It was thus Tandi, who was a vast heap<br>of penances, praised Isana. And he sang also that high Brahman which in<br>ancient days was sung by the Creator himself (in honour of Mahadeva).<br><br>"Upamanyu continued, 'Thus praised by that utterer of Brahma, Viz.,<br>Tandi, Mahadeva that illustrious and puissant Deity, who was accompanied<br>by his spouse lima, said these words. Tandi had further said,&#8212;Neither<br>Brahma, nor Indra nor Vishnu, nor the Viswedevas, nor the great Rishis,<br>know thee. Gratified at this, Siva said the following words.'<br><br>"The holy one said, 'Thou shalt be indestructible and eternal. Thou shalt<br>be freed from all sorrow. Great fame shall be thine. Thou shalt be endued<br>with energy. Spiritual knowledge shall be thine. All the Rishis shall<br>seek thee, and thy son, through my grace, shall become the author of<br>Sutras, O foremost of regenerate persons. What wishes of thine shall I<br>grant today? Tell me, O son, what those objects are which thou<br>desirest.&#8212;At this, Tandi joined his hands and said&#8212;O Lord, let my<br>devotion to thee be steady.'<br><br>"Upamanyu continued, 'Having given unto Tandi these boons and having<br>received the adorations of both the deities and the Rishis, the great<br>Deity disappeared there and then. When the illustrious deity, O lord of<br>the Yadavas, thus, disappeared with all his followers, the Rishi came to<br>my asylum and said unto me all that had happened to him. Do thou hear, O<br>foremost of men, all those celebrated names (of Mahadeva) that Tandi said<br>unto me for thy spiritual success. The Grandsire had at one time recited<br>ten thousand names that apply to Mahadeva. In the scriptures, a thousand<br>names occur of that illustrious deity. These names are not known to all.<br>O thou that transcendest destruction, in days of yore, the Grandsire<br>Brahma uttered these names for adoring the high-souled Deity. Having<br>acquired them through the grace of the Grandsire, Tandi communicated them<br>to me!'"[87]
