                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Which amongst these three is superior, viz.,<br>knowledge, penances, and gifts? I ask thee, O foremost of righteous<br>persons! Do tell me this, O grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative of the<br>conversation between Maitreya and the Island-born Krishna. Once on a<br>time, the Island-born Krishna, O king, while wandering over the world in<br>disguise, proceeded to Baranasi and waited upon Maitreya who belonged by<br>birth to a race of Munis[531]. Seeing Vyasa arrive, that foremost of<br>Rishis, viz., Maitreya, gave him a seat and after worshipping him with<br>due rites, fed him with excellent food. Having eaten that good food which<br>was very wholesome and which produced every kind of gratification, the<br>high-souled Krishna became exceedingly delighted and as he sat there, he<br>even laughed aloud. Seeing Krishna laugh, Maitreya addressed him, saying,<br>'Tell me, O righteous-souled one, what the reason is of thy laughter!<br>Thou art an ascetic, endued with capacity to control thy emotions. Great<br>joy, it seems, has come over thee! Saluting thee, and worshipping thee<br>with bent head, I ask thee this, viz., what the puissance is of my<br>penances and what the high blessedness is that is thine! The acts I do<br>are different from those which thou doest. Thou art already emancipated<br>though still owning life-breaths. I, however, am not yet freed. For all<br>that I think that there is not much difference between thee and me. I am<br>again, distinguished by birth.'[532]<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'This wonder that has filled me hath arisen from an<br>ordinance that looks like a hyperbole, and from its paradoxical statement<br>for the comprehension of the people. The declaration of the Vedas seems<br>to be untrue. But why should the Vedas say an untruth? It has been said<br>that there are three tracks which constitute the best vows of a man One<br>should never injure; one should always tell the truth; and one should<br>make gifts. The Rishis of old announced this, following the declarations<br>of the Vedas. These injunctions were heard in days of old,&#8212;they should<br>certainly be followed by us even in our times. Even a small gift, made<br>under the circumstances laid down, produces great fruits[533]. Unto a<br>thirsty man thou hast given a little water with a sincere heart. Thyself<br>thirsty and hungry, thou hast, by giving me such food, conquered many<br>high regions of felicity, O puissant one, as, one does by many<br>sacrifices. I am exceedingly delighted with thy very sacred gift, as also<br>with thy penances. Thy puissance is that of Righteousness: Thy appearance<br>is that of Righteousness. The fragrance of Righteousness is about thee. I<br>think that all thy acts are performed agreeably to the ordinance, O son,<br>superior to ablutions in sacred waters superior to the accomplishment of<br>all Vedic vows, is gift. Indeed, O Brahmana, gift is more auspicious than<br>all sacred acts. If it be not more meritorious than all sacred acts,<br>there can be no question about its superiority. All those rites laid down<br>in the Vedas which thou applaudest do not come up to gift, for gift<br>without doubt, is as I hold, fraught with very superior merit. The track<br>that has been made by those men who make gifts is the track that is<br>trodden by the wise. They who make gifts are regarded as givers of even<br>the life-breaths. The duties that constitute Righteousness are<br>established in them. As the Vedas when well-studied, as the restraining<br>of the senses, as a life of universal Renunciation, even so is gift which<br>is fraught with very superior merit. Thou, O son, wilt rise from joy to<br>greater joy in consequence of thy having betaken thyself to the duty of<br>making gifts The man of intelligence (who practises this duty) certainly<br>rises from joy to greater joy. We have without doubt, met with many<br>direct instances of this. Men endued with prosperity succeed in acquiring<br>wealth, making gifts, performing sacrifices, and earning happiness as the<br>result thereof. It is always observed, O thou of great wisdom, to happen<br>naturally that happiness is followed by misery and misery is followed by<br>happiness.[534] Men of wisdom nave said that human beings in this world<br>have three kinds of conduct. Some are righteous, some are sinful: and<br>some are neither righteous nor sinful. The conduct of the person who is<br>devoted to Brahma is not regarded either way. His sins are never regarded<br>as sins. So also the man who is devoted to the duties laid down for him<br>is regarded as neither righteous nor sinful (for the observance of those<br>duties). Those men that are devoted to sacrifices, gifts, and penances,<br>are regarded as righteous. These, however, that injure other creatures<br>and are unfriendly to them, are regarded as sinful. There are some men<br>who appropriate what belongs to others. These certainly fall into Hell<br>and meet with misery. All other acts that men do are indifferent, being<br>regarded as neither righteous nor sinful. Do thou sport and grow and<br>rejoice and make gifts and perform sacrifices. Neither men of knowledge<br>nor those endued with penances will then be able to get the better of<br>thee!'"
