                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Do thou, O foremost one of Kuru's race, discourse<br>unto me once again of the excellent ordinance regarding gifts, with<br>especial reference, O thou of great wisdom, to the gift of earth. A<br>Kshatriya should make gifts of earth unto a Brahmana of righteous deeds.<br>Such a Brahmana should accept the gift with due rites. None else,<br>however, than a Kshatriya is competent to make gifts of earth. It behoves<br>thee now to tell me what these objects are that persons of all classes<br>are free to bestow if moved by the desire of earning merit. Thou shouldst<br>also tell me what has been said in the Vedas on this subject.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'There are three gifts that go by the same name and that<br>are productive of equal merits. Indeed, these three confer the fruition<br>of every wish. The three objects whose gifts are of such a character are<br>kine, earth, and knowledge.[350] That person who tells his disciple words<br>of righteous import drawn from the Vedas acquires merit equal to that<br>which is won by making gifts of earth and kine. Similarly are kine<br>praised (as objects of gifts). There is no object of gift higher than<br>they. Kine are supposed to confer merit immediately. They are also, O<br>Yudhishthira, such that a gift of them cannot but lead to great merit.<br>Kine are the mothers of all creatures. They bestow every kind of<br>happiness. The person that desires his own prosperity should always make<br>gifts of kine. No one should kick at kine or proceed through the midst of<br>kine. Kine are goddesses and homes of auspiciousness. For this reason,<br>they always deserve worship. Formerly, the deities, while tilling the<br>earth whereon they performed a sacrifice, used the goad for striking the<br>bullocks yoked to the plough. Hence, in tilling earth for such a purpose,<br>one may, without incurring censure or sin, apply the goad to bullocks. In<br>other acts, however, bullocks should never be struck with the goad or the<br>whip When kine are grazing or lying down no one should annoy them in any<br>way. When the cows are thirsty and they do not get water (in consequence<br>of any one obstructing their access to the pool or tank or river), they,<br>by merely looking at such a person, can destroy him with all his<br>relatives and friends. What creatures can be more sacred than kine when<br>with the very dung of kine altars whereon Sraddhas are performed in<br>honour of the Pitris, or those whereon the deities are worshipped, are<br>cleansed and sanctified? That man, who, before eating himself gives every<br>day, for a year, only a handful of grass unto a cow belonging to another,<br>is regarded as undergoing a vow or observance which bestows the fruition<br>of every wish. Such a person ac-quires children and fame and wealth and<br>prosperity, and dispels all evils and dreams.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'What should be the indications of those kine that<br>deserve to be given away? What are those kine that should be passed over<br>in the matter of gifts? What should be the character of those persons<br>unto whom kine should be given? Who, again, are those unto whom kine<br>should not be given?<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'A cow should never be given unto one that is not<br>righteous in behaviour, or one that is sinful, or one that is covetous or<br>one that is untruthful in speech, or one that does not make offerings<br>unto the Pitris and deities. A person, by making a gift of ten kine unto<br>a Brahmana learned in the Vedas, poor in earthly wealth, possessed of<br>many children, and owning a domestic are, attains to numerous regions of<br>great felicity. When a man performs any act that is fraught with merit<br>assisted by what he has got in gift from another, a portion of the merit<br>attaching to that act becomes always his with whose wealth the act has<br>been accomplished. He that procreates a person, he that rescues a person,<br>and he that assigns the means of sustenance to a person are regarded as<br>the three sires. Services dutifully rendered to the preceptor destroys<br>sin. Pride destroys even great fame. The possession of three children<br>destroys the reproach of childlessness, and the possession of ten kine<br>dispels the reproach of poverty. Unto one that is devoted to the Vedanta,<br>that is endued with great learning, that has been filled with wisdom,<br>that has a complete control over his senses, that is observant of the<br>restraints laid down in the scriptures, that has withdrawn himself from<br>all worldly attachments, unto him that says agreeable words unto all<br>creatures, unto him that would never do an evil act even when impelled by<br>hunger, unto one that is mild or possessed of a peaceful disposition,<br>unto one that is hospitable to all guests,&#8212;verily unto such a Brahmana<br>should a man, possessed of similar conduct and owning children and wives,<br>assign the means of sustenance. The measure of merit that attaches to the<br>gift of kine unto a deserving person is exactly the measure of the sin<br>that attaches to the act of robbing a Brahmana of what belongs to him.<br>Under all circumstances should the spoliation of what belongs to a<br>Brahmana be avoided, and his spouses kept at a distance.'"
