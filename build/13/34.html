                            "Bhishma said, 'One should always offer the most reverent worship unto<br>the Brahmanas. They have Soma for their king, and they it is who confer<br>happiness and misery upon others. They, O king, should always be<br>cherished and protected as one cherishes and protects one's own sires and<br>grandsires, and should be adored with bows and gifts of food and<br>ornaments and other articles of enjoyment, as also with such things as<br>they may desire. The peace and happiness of the kingdom flow from such<br>respect shown to the Brahmanas even as the peace and happiness of all<br>living creatures flow from Vasava, the chief of the celestials. Let<br>Brahmanas of pure behaviour and Brahma-effulgence be born in a kingdom.<br>Kshatriyas also that are splendid car-warriors and that are capable of<br>scorching all foes, should be desired (amongst those that settle in a<br>kingdom). This was said unto me by Narada. There is nothing higher, O<br>king, than this, viz., the act of causing a Brahmana possessed of good<br>birth, having a knowledge of morality and righteousness, and steadfast in<br>the observance of excellent vows, to take up his residence in one's<br>mansion. Such an act is productive of every kind of blessing. The<br>sacrificial offerings given unto Brahmanas reach the very deities who<br>accept them. Brahmanas are the sires of all creatures. There is nothing<br>higher than a Brahmana. Aditya, Chandramas, Wind, Water, Earth, Sky and<br>the points of the compass, all enter the body of the Brahmana and take<br>what the Brahmana eats.[257] In that house where Brahmanas do not eat,<br>the Pitris refuse to eat. The deities also never eat in the house of the<br>wretch who hates the Brahmanas. When the Brahmanas are gratified, the<br>Pitris also are gratified. There is no doubt in this. They that give away<br>the sacrificial butter unto the Brahmanas become themselves gratified (in<br>this and the other world). Such men never meet with destruction. Verily,<br>they succeed in attaining to high ends. Those particular offerings in<br>sacrifices with which one gratifies the Brahmanas go to gratify both the<br>Pitris and the deities. The Brahmana is the cause of that sacrifice<br>whence all created things have sprung. The Brahmana is acquainted with<br>that from which this universe has sprung and unto which, when apparently<br>destroyed, it returns. Indeed the Brahmana knows the path that leads to<br>Heaven and the other path that leads to the opposite place. The Brahmana<br>is conversant with what has happened and what will happen. The Brahmana<br>is the foremost of all two-legged beings. The Brahmana, O chief of the<br>Bharatas, is fully conversant with the duties that have been laid down<br>for his order. Those persons that follow the Brahmanas are never<br>vanquished. Departing from this world, they never meet with destruction.<br>Indeed victory is always theirs. Those high-souled persons,&#8212;indeed,<br>those persons that have subdued their souls,&#8212;who accept the words that<br>fall from the lips of the Brahmanas, are never vanquished. Victory always<br>becomes theirs.[258] The energy and might of those Kshatriyas who scorch<br>everything with their energy and might become neutralised when they<br>encounter the Brahmanas. The Bhrigus conquered the Talajanghas. The son<br>of Angiras conquered the Nipas. Bharadwaja conquered the Vitahavyas as<br>also the Ailas. O chief of Bharata's race. Although all these Kshatriyas<br>were capable of using diverse kinds of arms, yet the Brahmanas named,<br>owning only black deer skins for their emblems, succeeded in conquering<br>them effectually. Bestowing the Earth upon the Brahmanas and illuminating<br>both the worlds by the splendour of such a deed, one should accomplish<br>acts through which one may succeed in attaining to the end of all<br>things.[259] Like fire concealed within wood, everything that is said or<br>heard or read in this world, lies ensconced in the Brahmana. In this<br>connection is cited the old history of the conversation between Vasudeva<br>and the Earth, O chief of Bharata's race!'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'O mother of all creatures, O auspicious goddess, I<br>desire to ask thee for a solution of this doubt of mine. By what act does<br>a man leading the domestic mode of life succeed in cleansing all his<br>sins?'<br><br>"The Earth said, 'One should serve the Brahmanas. This conduct is<br>cleansing and excellent. All the impurities destroyed of that man who<br>serves the Brahmanas with reverence. From this (conduct) arises<br>prosperity. From this arises fame. From this springs forth intelligence<br>or knowledge of the soul. A Kshatriya by this conduct, becomes a mighty<br>car-warrior and a scorcher of foes and succeeds in acquiring great fame.<br>Even this is what Narada said unto me, viz., that one should always<br>revere a Brahmana that is well-born, of rigid vows and conversant with<br>the scriptures, if one desires every kind of prosperity. That man really<br>grows in prosperity who is applauded by the Brahmanas, who are higher<br>than those that are regarded superior to all men high or low. That man<br>who speaks ill of the Brahmanas soon meets with discomfiture, even as a<br>clod of unbaked earth meets with destruction when cast into the sea.<br>After the same manner, all acts that are hurtful to the Brahmanas are<br>sure to bring about discomfiture and ruin. Behold the dark spots on the<br>Moon and the salt waters of the ocean. The great Indra had at one time<br>been marked all over with a thousand sex-marks. It was through the power<br>of the Brahmanas that those marks became altered into as so many eyes.<br>Behold, O Mahadeva how all those things took place. Desiring fame and<br>prosperity and diverse regions of beautitude in the next world, a person<br>of pure behaviour and soul should, O slayer of Madhu, live in obedience<br>to the dictates of the Brahmanas.'[260]<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Hearing these words of the goddess Earth, the slayer<br>of Madhu, O thou of Kuru's race, exclaimed,&#8212;Excellent, Excellent&#8212;and<br>honoured the goddess in due form. Having heard this discourse between the<br>goddess Earth and Madhava, do thou, O son of Pritha, always, with rapt<br>soul, worship all superior Brahmanas. Doing this, thou shalt verily<br>obtain what is highly beneficial for thee!"'
