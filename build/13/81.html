                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, what is that which is the most<br>sacred of all sacred things in the world, other than that which has been<br>already mentioned, and which is the highest of all sanctifying objects.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Kine are the foremost of all objects. They are highly<br>sacred and they rescue men (from all kinds of sin and distress). With<br>their milk and with the Havi manufactured therefrom, kine uphold all<br>creatures in the universe. O best of the Bharatas, there is nothing that<br>is more sacred than kine. The foremost of all things in the three worlds,<br>kine are themselves sacred and capable of cleansing others, Kine reside<br>in a region that is even higher than the region of the deities. When<br>given away, they rescue their givers. Men of wisdom succeed in attaining<br>to Heaven by making gifts of kine. Yuvanaswa's son Mandhatri, Yayati, and<br>(his sire) Nahusha, used always to give away kine in thousands. As the<br>reward of those gifts, they have attained to such regions as are<br>unattainable by the very deities. There is, in this connection, O sinless<br>one, a discourse delivered of old. I shall recite it to thee. Once on a<br>time, the intelligent Suka, having finished his morning rites, approached<br>with a restrained mind his sire, that foremost of Rishis, viz., the<br>Island-born Krishna, who is acquainted with the distinction between that<br>which is superior and that which is inferior, and saluting him, said,<br>'What is that sacrifice which appears to thee as the foremost of all<br>sacrifices? What is that act by doing which men of wisdom succeed in<br>attaining to the highest region? What is that sacred act by which the<br>deities enjoy the felicity of Heaven? What constitutes the character of<br>sacrifice as sacrifice? What is that upon which sacrifice rests? What is<br>that which is regarded as the best by the deities? What is that sacrifice<br>which transcends the sacrifices of this world? Do thou also tell me, O<br>sire, what is that which is the most sacred of all things. Having heard<br>these words of his son, O chief of Bharata's race, Vyasa, the foremost of<br>all persons conversant with duties, discoursed as follows unto him.'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'Kine constitute the stay of all creatures. Kine are the<br>refuge of all creatures. Kine are the embodiment of merit. Kine are<br>sacred, and kine are sanctifiers of all. Formerly kine were hornless as<br>it has been heard by us. For obtaining horns they adored the eternal and<br>puissant Brahmana. The puissant, Brahmana, seeing the kine paying their<br>adorations to him and sitting in praya, granted unto each of them what<br>each desired. Thereafter their horns grew and each got what each desired.<br>Of diverse colours, and endued with horns, they began to shine in beauty,<br>O son! Favoured by Brahman himself with boons, kine are auspicious and<br>yielders of Havya and Kavya. They are the embodiments of merit. They are<br>sacred and blessed. They are possessed of excellent form and attributes.<br>Kine constitute high and highly excellent energy. The gift of kine is<br>very much applauded. Those good men who, freed from pride, make gifts of<br>kine, are regarded as doers of righteous deeds and as givers of all<br>articles. Such men, O sinless one, attain to the highly sacred region of<br>kine. The trees there produce sweet fruits. Indeed, those trees are<br>always adorned with excellent flowers and fruits. Those flowers, O best<br>of regenerate persons, are endued with celestial fragrance. The entire<br>soil of that region is made of gems. The sands there are all gold. The<br>climate there is such that the excellencies of every season are felt.<br>There is no more mire, no dust. It is, indeed, highly auspicious. The<br>streams that run there shine in resplendence for the red lotuses blooming<br>upon their bosoms, and for the jewels and gems and gold that occur in<br>their banks and that display the effulgence of the morning Sun. There are<br>many lakes also in that region on whose breasts are many lotuses, mixed<br>here and there with Nymphoea stellata, and having their petals made of<br>costly gems, and their filaments adorned with a complexion like that of<br>gold. They are also adorned with flowering forests of the Nerium odorum<br>with thousands of beautiful creepers twining round them, as also with<br>forests of Santanakas bearing their flowery burdens. There are rivers<br>whose banks are variegated with many bright pearls and resplendent gems<br>and shining gold. Portions of those regions are covered with excellent<br>trees that are decked with jewels and gems of every kind. Some of them<br>are made of gold and some display the splendour of fire. There stand many<br>mountains made of gold, and many hills and eminences made of jewels and<br>gems. These shine in beauty in consequence of their tall summits which<br>are composed of all kinds of gems. The trees that adorn those regions<br>always put forth flowers and fruits, and are always covered with dense<br>foliage. The flowers always emit a celestial fragrance and the fruits are<br>exceedingly sweet, O chief of Bharata's race. Those persons that are of<br>righteous deeds, O Yudhishthira, always sport there in joy. Freed from<br>grief and wrath, they pass their time there, crowned with the fruition of<br>every wish. Persons of righteous deeds, possessed of fame, sport there in<br>happiness, moving from place to place, O Bharata, on delightful vehicles<br>of great beauty. Auspicious deed, bands of Apsaras always amuse them<br>there, with music and dance. Indeed O Yudhishthira, a person goes to such<br>regions as the reward of his making gifts of kine. Those regions which<br>have for their lords Pushan, and the Maruts of great puissance, are<br>attained to by givers of kine. In affluence the royal Varuna is regarded<br>as pre-eminent. The giver of kine attains to affluence like that of<br>Varuna himself. One should, with the steadiness of a vow, daily recite<br>these Mantras declared by Prajapati himself (in respect of kine).<br>Viswarupa and viz.,&#8212;Yugandharah, Surupah, Vahurupah, and<br>Matara.[379]&#8212;He who serves kine with reverence and who follows them with<br>humility, succeeds in obtaining many invaluable boons from kine who<br>become gratified with him. One should never, in even one's heart, do an<br>injury to kine. One should, indeed, always confer happiness on them. One<br>should, always reverence kine and worship them, with bends of one's head.<br>He who does this, restraining his senses the while and filled with<br>cheerfulness, succeeds in attaining to that felicity which is enjoyed by<br>kine (and which kine alone can confer). One should for three days drink<br>the hot urine of the cow. For the next three days one should drink the<br>hot milk of the cow. Having thus drunk for three days hot milk, one<br>should next drink hot ghee for three days. Having in this way drunk hot<br>ghee for three days, one should subsist for the next three days on air<br>only. That sacred thing by whose aid the deities enjoy regions of<br>felicity, that which is the most sacred of all sacred things, viz., ghee<br>should then be borne on the head.[380] With the aid of ghee one should<br>pour libations on the sacred fire. By making gifts of ghee, one should<br>cause the Brahman to utter benedictions on oneself. One should eat ghee<br>and make gifts of ghee. As the reward of this conduct, one may then<br>attain to that prosperity which belongs to kine. That man who, for a<br>month, subsists upon the gruel of barley picked up every day from cow<br>dung becomes cleansed of sins as grave as the slaughter of a Brahman.<br>After their defeat at the hands of the Daityas, the deities practised<br>this expiation. It was in consequence of this expiation that they<br>succeeded in regaining their position as deities. Verily, it was through<br>this that they regained their strength and became crowned with success.<br>Kine are sacred. They are embodiments of merit. They are high and most<br>efficacious cleansers of all. By making gifts of kine unto the Brahmanas<br>one attains to Heaven. Living in a pure state, in the midst of kine, one<br>should mentally recite those sacred Mantras that are known by the name of<br>Gomati, after touching pure water. By doing this, one becomes purified<br>and cleansed (of all sins). Brahmanas of righteous deeds, who have been<br>cleansed by knowledge, study of the Vedas, and observance of vows,<br>should, only in the midst of sacred fires or kine or assemblies of<br>Brahmanas, impart unto their disciples a knowledge of the Gomati Mantras<br>which are every way like unto a sacrifice (for the merit they produce).<br>One should observe a fast for three nights for receiving the boon<br>constituted by a knowledge of the import of the Gomati Mantras. The man<br>who is desirous of obtaining a son may obtain one by adoring these<br>Mantras. He who desires the possession of wealth may have his desire<br>gratified by adoring these Mantras. The girl desirous of having a good<br>husband may have her wish fulfilled by the same means. In fact, one may<br>acquire the fruition of every wish one may cherish, by adoring these<br>sacred Mantras. When kine are gratified with the service one renders<br>them, they are, without doubt, capable of granting the fruition of every<br>wish. Even so, kine are highly blessed. They are the essential requisites<br>of sacrifices. They are grantors of every wish. Know that there is<br>nothing superior to kine.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by his high-souled sire, Suka, endued<br>with great energy, began from that time to worship kine every day. Do<br>thou also, O son, conduct thyself in the same way.'"
