                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Then the royal son of Kunti, having duly honoured<br>the citizens and the inhabitants of the province, dismissed them to their<br>respective homes. The Pandava king then consoled these women, who had<br>lost their heroic husbands and sons in the battle, with abundant gift of<br>wealth. Having recovered his kingdom, Yudhishthira of great wisdom caused<br>himself to be duly installed on the throne. That foremost of men then<br>assured all his subjects by diverse acts of good will. That foremost of<br>righteous men then set himself to earn the substantial blessing of the<br>Brahmanas, of the foremost military officers, and the leading citizens.<br>The blessed monarch having passed fifty nights in the capital recollected<br>the time indicated by his grandsire as the hour of his departure from<br>this world. Accompanied by a number of priests he then set out of the<br>city named after the elephant, having seen that the sun ceasing to go<br>southwards had begun to proceed in his northward course. Yudhishthira the<br>son of Kunti took with him a large quantity of clarified butter and<br>floral garlands and scents and silken cloths and excellent sandalwood and<br>Aquilaria Agallocha and dark sloe wood, for cremating the body of<br>Bhishma. Diverse kinds of costly garlands and gems also were among those<br>stores. Placing Dhritarashtra ahead and queen Gandhari celebrated for her<br>virtues, and his own mother Kunti and all his brothers also, Yudhishthira<br>of great intelligence, accompanied by Krishna and Vidura of great wisdom,<br>as also by Yuyutsu and Yuyudhana, and by his other relatives and<br>followers forming a large train, proceeded, his praises hymned the while<br>by eulogists and bards. The sacrificial fires of Bhishma were also borne<br>in the procession. Thus accompanied, the king set out from his city like<br>a second chief of the deities. Soon he came upon the spot where the son<br>of Santanu was till lying on his bed of arrows. He beheld his grandsire<br>waited upon with reverence by Parasara's son Vyasa of great intelligence,<br>by Narada, O royal sage, by Devala and Asita, and also by the remnant of<br>unslain kings assembled from various parts of the country. Indeed, the<br>king saw that his high-souled grandsire, as he lay on his heroic bed, was<br>guarded on all sides by the warriors appointed for that duty. Alighting<br>from his car, King Yudhishthira with his brothers saluted his grandsire,<br>the chastiser of all foes. They also saluted the Rishis with the<br>island-born Vyasa at their head. They were saluted in return by them.<br>Accompanied by his priests each of whom resembled the grandsire Brahman<br>himself, as also by his brothers, Yudhishthira of unfading glory then<br>approached that spot whereon Bhishma lay on his bed of arrows surrounded<br>by these reverend Rishis. Then king Yudhishthira the just, at the head of<br>his brothers, addressed that foremost one of Kuru's race, viz., the son<br>of the River Ganga, as he lay on that bed of his, saying, 'I am<br>Yudhishthira, O king! Salutations to thee, O son of the River Janhavi! If<br>thou hearest me still, tell me what I am to do for thee! Bearing with me<br>thy sacrificial fires, I have come here, O king, and wait upon thee at<br>the hour indicated! Preceptors of all branches of learning, Brahmanas,<br>Ritwiks, all my brothers, thy son, viz., king Dhritarashtra of great<br>energy, are all here with my counsellors as also Vasudeva of great<br>prowess. The remnant of unslain warriors, and all the denizens of<br>Kurujangala, are also here. Opening thy eyes, O chief of Kuru's race, do<br>thou behold them! Whatever should be done on this occasion has all been<br>arranged and provided for by me. Indeed, at this hour which thou hadst<br>indicated, all things have been kept ready!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by Kunti's son of great<br>intelligence, the son of Ganga opened his eyes and saw all the Bharatas<br>assembled there and standing around him. The mighty Bhishma then, taking<br>the strong hand of Yudhishthira, addressed him in a voice deep as that of<br>the clouds. That thorough master of words said, 'By good luck, O son of<br>Kunti, thou hast come here with all thy counsellors, O Yudhishthira! The<br>thousand-rayed maker of day, the holy Surya has begun his northward<br>course. I have been lying on my bed here for eight and fifty nights.<br>Stretched on these sharp-pointed arrows I have felt this period to be as<br>long as if it was a century. O Yudhishthira, the lunar month of Magha has<br>come. This is, again, the lighted fortnight and a fourth part of it ought<br>by this (according to my calculations) be over.' Having said so unto<br>Yudhishthira the son of Dharma, Ganga's son Bhishma then saluted<br>Dhritarashtra and said unto him as follows.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O king, thou art well-conversant with duties. All thy<br>doubts, again, relating to the science of wealth have been well-solved.<br>Thou hast waited upon many Brahmanas of great learning. The subtle<br>sciences connected with the Vedas, all the duties of religion, O king,<br>and the whole of the four Vedas, are well-known to thee! Thou shouldst<br>not grieve, therefore, O son of Kuru! That which was pre-ordained has<br>happened. It could not be otherwise. Thou hast heard the mysteries<br>relating to the deities from the lips of the island-born Rishi himself.<br>Yudhishthira and his brothers are morally as much thy sons as they are<br>the sons of Pandu. Observant of the duties of religion, do thou cherish<br>and protect them. In their turn, they are always devoted to the service<br>of their seniors. King Yudhishthira the just is pure-souled. He will<br>always prove obedient to thee! I know that he is devoted to the virtue of<br>compassion or abstention from injury. He is devoted to his seniors and<br>preceptors. Thy sons were all wicked-souled. They were wedded to wrath<br>and cupidity. Overwhelmed by envy, they were all of wicked behavior. It<br>behoveth thee not to grieve for them!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said this much unto Dhritarashtra of<br>great wisdom, the Kuru hero then addressed Vasudeva of mighty arms.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O holy one, O god of all gods, O thou that art worshipped<br>by all the deities and Asuras, O thou that didst cover the three worlds<br>with three steps of thine, salutations to thee, O wielder of the conch,<br>the discus, and the mace! Thou art Vasudeva, thou art of golden body,<br>thou art the one Purusha (or active agent), thou art the creator (of the<br>universe), thou art of vast proportions. Thou art Jiva. Thou art subtle.<br>Thou art the Supreme and eternal Soul. Do thou, O lotus-eyed one, rescue<br>me, O foremost of all beings! Do thou, give me permission, O Krishna, to<br>depart from this world, O thou that art Supreme felicity, O foremost of<br>all beings! The sons of Pandu should ever be protected by thee. Thou art,<br>indeed, already their sole refuge. Formerly, I spoke to the foolish<br>Duryodhana of wicked understanding that thither is Righteousness where<br>Krishna is, and that there is victory where Righteousness is. I further<br>counselled him that relying on Vasudeva as his refuge, he should make<br>peace with the Pandavas. Indeed, I repeatedly told him, 'This is the<br>fittest time for thee to make peace! The foolish Duryodhana of wicked<br>understanding, however, did not do my bidding. Having caused a great<br>havoc on earth, at last, he himself laid down his life. Thee, O<br>illustrious one, I know to be that ancient and best of Rishis who dwelt<br>for many years in the company of Nara, in the retreat of Vadari. The<br>celestial Rishi Narada told me this, as also Vyasa of austere penances.<br>Even they have said unto me that. Thyself and Arjuna are the old Rishis<br>Narayana and Nara born among men. Do thou, O Krishna, grant me leave, I<br>shall cast off my body. Permitted by thee, I shall attain to the highest<br>end!'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'I give thee leave, O Bhishma! Do thou, O king, attain to<br>the status of the Vasus, O thou of great splendour, thou hast not been<br>guilty of a single transgression in this world. O royal sage, thou art<br>devoted to thy sire. Thou art, therefore, like a second Markandeya! It is<br>for that reason that death depends upon thy pleasure even as thy slave<br>expectant of reading thy pleasure!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said these words, the son of Ganga once<br>more addressed the Pandavas headed by Dhritarashtra, and other friends<br>and well-wishers of his, 'I desire to cast off my lifebreaths. It<br>behoveth you to give me leave. Ye should strive for attaining to truth.<br>Truth constitutes the highest power. Ye should always live with Brahmanas<br>of righteous conduct, devoted to penances, ever abstaining from cruel<br>behaviour, and who have their souls under control!' Having said these<br>words unto his friends and embraced them all, the intelligent Bhishma<br>once more addressed Yudhishthira, saying, 'O king, let all Brahmanas,<br>especially those that are endued with wisdom, let them who are<br>preceptors, let those who are priests capable of assisting as sacrifices,<br>be adorable in thy estimation.'"
