                            "Narada said, 'Having said these words, the puissant Mahadeva himself<br>became desirous of hearing (instead of talking), and with that view he<br>questioned his dear spouse who was seated by his side and she was fully<br>inclined to act up to his desire.'<br><br>"Mahadeva said, 'Thou, O goddess, art conversant with what is Supreme and<br>what is not.[576] Thou art acquainted with all duties, O thou that lovest<br>to reside in the retreats of ascetics. Thou art endued with every virtue,<br>possessed of beautiful eyebrows and hair ending in the fairest curls, O<br>daughter of Himavat, the king of mountains! Thou art skilled in every<br>work. Thou art endued with self-restraint and thou lookest impartially<br>upon all creatures. Divested of the sense of meum, thou art devoted to<br>the practice of all the duties. O thou of beautiful features, I desire to<br>ask thee about something. I wish that, asked by me, thou wilt discourse<br>to me on that topic. Savitri is the chaste wife of Brahma. The chaste<br>Sachi is the wife of Indra. Dhumrorna is the spouse of Markandeya, and<br>Riddhi of (king) Vaisravana. Varuna has Gauri for his spouse, and Surya<br>has Suvarchala. Rohini is the chaste wife of Sasin, and Swaha of<br>Vibhavasu. Kasyapa has Aditi. All these regard their husbands as their<br>gods. Thou hast, O goddess, conversed and associated with all of them<br>every day. It is for this reason, O thou that art conversant with every<br>duty, that I desire to question thee about the duties of women, O thou<br>whose words are always consistent with righteousness. I desire to hear<br>thee discourse on that subject from the beginning. Thou practisest all<br>the duties of righteousness with me. Thy conduct is exactly like mine,<br>and the vows thou observest are the same that are observed by me. Thy<br>puissance and energy are equal to mine, and thou hast undergone the<br>austerest penances. The subject, when discoursed upon by thee, will<br>become endued with great merit. Indeed, that discourse will then become<br>authoritative in the world. Women, in especial, are the highest refuge of<br>women. O thou of beautiful hips, among human beings that course of<br>conduct which thou wilt lay down will be followed from generation to<br>generation.[577] Half of my body is made up of half thy body. Thou art<br>always engaged in doing the work of the deities, and it is thou that art<br>the cause of the peopling of the earth, O auspicious lady, all the<br>eternal duties of women are well-known to thee. Do thou, therefore, tell<br>me in detail what are the duties of thy sex.'<br><br>"Uma said, 'O holy one, O lord of all created things, O source of all<br>that is past, present, and future, it is through thy grace that the words<br>I am uttering are taking their rise in my mind. All these Rivers (that<br>are of my sex), O god of gods, endued with the waters of all the Tirthas,<br>are approaching thy presence for enabling thee to perform thy ablutions<br>in them.[578] After consulting them I shall discourse on the topic named,<br>in due order. That person who, though competent, is still free from<br>egotism, is rightly called a Purusha.[579] As regards woman, O lord of<br>all beings, she follows persons of her sex. By consulting these foremost<br>of Rivers, they will be honoured by me. The sacred Saraswati is the<br>foremost river of all rivers. She courses towards the ocean and is truly<br>the first of all streams. Vipasa also here, and Vitasta, and<br>Chandrabhaga, and Iravati, and Satadru, and the river Devika, and<br>Kausiki, and Gomati.[580] and this celestial River who has in her all the<br>sacred Tirthas, viz., the goddess Ganga, who having her rise in Heaven<br>hath descended on the Earth and is regarded as the foremost of all<br>streams; Having said this, the spouse of that god of gods, that foremost<br>of all righteous persons, smilingly addressed all those Rivers of her<br>sex. Indeed, the spouse of the great god, devoted to the performance of<br>all duties, questioned those individuals of her sex about the duties of<br>women. Verily, those foremost of rivers having Ganga for their first are<br>all conversant with the duties of women.'<br><br>"Uma said, 'The illustrious god has asked a question relating to the<br>duties of women. I desire to answer Sankara after having consulted with<br>you. I do not see any branch of knowledge on Earth or Heaven that is<br>capable of being mastered by any unaided individual. Ye rivers that run<br>towards the ocean, it is for this that I seek your opinions! It was in<br>this way that those foremost of Rivers, all of whom were auspicious and<br>highly sacred, were questioned by Siva's spouse. Then the celestial River<br>Ganga, who worshipped the daughter of the prince of mountains in return,<br>was selected for answering the question. Verily, she of sweet smiles is<br>held as swelling with diverse kinds of understanding and well-conversant<br>with the duties of women. The sacred goddess, capable of dispelling all<br>fear of sin, possessed of humility in consequence of her intelligence,<br>well acquainted with all duties, and enriched with an intelligence<br>exceedingly comprehensive, sweetly smiling, uttered these, words, 'O<br>goddess, thou art always devoted to the due performance of all duties.<br>Thou hast favoured me highly by thus questioning me! O sinless one, thou<br>art honoured by the entire universe, yet thou askest me that am but a<br>river. That person who, though himself competent (to discourse on a<br>topic) yet asks another, or who pays a graceful tribute to another,<br>certainly deserves, I think, to be regarded as righteous-souled. Verily,<br>such a person deserves to be called learned and wise. That person never<br>falls into disgrace who asks such speakers as are endued with knowledge<br>and science and as are well-conversant with premises and inferences. A<br>proud man, even when enriched with intelligence, by speaking in the midst<br>of an assembly otherwise (that is, by relying upon his own powers alone<br>and without reference to or consultation with others), finds himself<br>uttering only words of weak import. Thou art possessed of spiritual<br>insight, Thou art the foremost of all denizens in Heaven. Thou hast taken<br>thy rise accompanied by diverse kinds of excellent merit. Thou, O<br>goddess, art fully competent to discourse on the duties of women! In this<br>way, the goddess Uma was worshipped by Ganga and honoured with the<br>ascription of many high merits. The beautiful, goddess, thus praised,<br>then began to discourse upon all the duties of women in full.'<br><br>"Uma said, 'I shall, according to the ordinance, discourse on the subject<br>of women's duties as far as they are known to me. Do ye all listen with<br>concentrated attention! The duties of women arise as created at the<br>outset by kinsmen in the rites of wedding. Indeed, a woman becomes, in<br>the presence of the nuptial fire, the associate of her lord in the<br>performance of all righteous deeds.[581] Possessed of a good disposition,<br>endued with sweet speech, sweet conduct, and sweet features, and always<br>looking at the face of her husband and deriving as much joy from it as<br>she does from looking at the face of her child, that chaste woman who<br>regulates her acts by observing the prescribed restraints, comes to be<br>regarded as truly righteous in her conduct. Listening (with reverence) to<br>the duties of wedded life (as expounded in the scriptures), and<br>accomplishing all those auspicious, duties, that woman who regards<br>righteousness as the foremost of all objects of pursuit, who observes the<br>same vows as those that are observed by her husband, who adorned with<br>chastity, looks upon her spouse as a god, who waits upon and serves him<br>as if he is a god, who surrenders her own will completely to that of her<br>lord, who is cheerful, who observes excellent vows, who is endued with<br>good features, and whose heart is completely devoted to her husband so<br>much that she never thinks even of any other man, is regarded as truly<br>righteous in conduct. That wife who, even when addressed harshly and<br>looked upon with angry eyes by her lord, presents a cheerful aspect to<br>him, is said to be truly devoted to her husband. She who does not cast<br>her eyes upon the Moon or the Sun or a tree that has a masculine name,<br>who is adored by her husband and who is possessed of beautiful features,<br>is regarded as truly righteous. That woman who treats her husband with<br>the affection which she shows towards her child, even when he (the<br>husband) happens to be poor or diseased or weak or worn out with the toil<br>of travelling, is regarded as truly righteous in her conduct. That woman<br>who is endued with self-control, who has given birth to children, who<br>serves her husband with devotion, and whose whole heart is devoted to<br>him, is regarded as truly righteous in her conduct. That woman who waits<br>upon and serves her lord with a cheerful heart, who is always cheerful of<br>heart, and who is possessed of humility, is regarded as truly righteous<br>in her conduct. That woman who always supports her kinsmen and relatives<br>by giving them food, and whose relish in gratifying her desires or for<br>articles of enjoyment, or for the affluence of which she is possessed, or<br>for the happiness with which she is surrounded, falls short of her relish<br>for her husband, is regarded as truly righteous in her conduct. That<br>woman who always takes a pleasure in rising at early down, who is devoted<br>to the discharge of all household duties, who always keeps her house<br>clean, who rubs her house daily with cowdung, who always attends to the<br>domestic fire (for pouring libations upon it), who never neglects to make<br>offerings of flowers and other articles to the deities, who with her<br>husband gratifies the deities and guests and all servants and dependants<br>of the family with that share of food which is theirs by the ordinances,<br>and who always takes, according to the ordinance, for herself, what food<br>remains in the house after the needs have been met of gods and guests and<br>servants, and who gratifies all people who come in contact with her<br>family and feed them to their fill, succeeds in acquiring great merit.<br>That woman who is endued with accomplishments, who gratifies the feet of<br>her father-in-law and mother-in-law, and who is always devoted to her<br>father and mother, is regarded as possessed of ascetic wealth. That woman<br>who supports with food Brahmanas that are weak and helpless, that are<br>distressed or blind or destitute, comes to be regarded as entitled to<br>share the merit of her husband. That woman who always observes, with a<br>light heart vows that are difficult of observance, whose heart is devoted<br>to her lord, and who always seeks good of her lord, is regarded as<br>entitled to share the merits of her husband. Devotion to her lord is<br>woman's merit; it is her penance; it is her eternal Heaven. Merit,<br>penances, and Heaven become hers who looks upon her husband as her all in<br>all, and who, endued with chastity, seeks to devote herself to her lord<br>in all things. The husband is the god which women have. The husband is<br>their friend, The husband is their high refuge. Women have no refuge that<br>can compare with their husbands, and no god that can compare with him.<br>The husband's grace and Heaven, are equal in the estimation of a woman;<br>or, if unequal, the inequality is very trivial. O Maheswara, I do not<br>desire Heaven itself if thou are not satisfied with me. If the husband<br>that is poor, or diseased or distressed or fallen among foes, or<br>afflicted by a Brahmana's curse, were to command the wife to accomplish<br>anything that is improper or unrighteous or that may lead to destruction<br>of life itself, the wife should, without any hesitation, accomplish it,<br>guided by the code whose propriety is sanctioned by the law of Distress.<br>I have thus, O god, expounded, at thy command, what the duties of women<br>are, Verily, that woman who conducts herself in this way becomes entitled<br>to a share of the merits won by her husband,'<br><br>"Narada continued, 'Thus addressed, the great god applauded the daughter<br>of the prince of mountains and then dismissed all persons that had<br>assembled there, together with all his own attendants. The diverse tribes<br>of ghostly beings, as also all the embodied Rivers, and the Gandharvas<br>and Apsaras, all bowed their heads unto Mahadeva and departed for<br>returning to the places whence they had come."
