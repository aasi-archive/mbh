                            (Anusasanika Parva)<br><br>OM! HAVING BOWED down unto Narayana, and Nara the foremost of male<br>beings, and unto the goddess Saraswati, must the word Jaya be uttered.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, tranquillity of mind has been said to<br>be subtile and of diverse forms. I have heard all thy discourses, but<br>still tranquillity of mind has not been mine. In this matter, various<br>means of quieting the mind have been related (by thee), O sire, but how<br>can peace of mind be secured from only a knowledge of the different kinds<br>of tranquillity, when I myself have been the instrument of bringing about<br>all this? Beholding thy body covered with arrows and festering with bad<br>sores, I fail to find, O hero, any peace of mind, at the thought of the<br>evils I have wrought. Beholding thy body, O most valiant of men, bathed<br>in blood, like a hill overrun with water from its springs, I am<br>languishing with grief even as the lotus in the rainy season. What can be<br>more painful than this, that thou, O grandsire, hast been brought to this<br>plight on my account by my people fighting against their foes on the<br>battle-field? Other princes also, with their sons and kinsmen, having met<br>with destruction on my account. Alas, what can be more painful than this.<br>Tell us, O prince, what destiny awaits us and the sons of Dhritarashtra,<br>who, driven by fate and anger, have done this abhorrent act. O lord of<br>men, I think the son of Dhritarashtra is fortunate in that he doth not<br>behold thee in this state. But I, who am the cause of thy death as well<br>as of that of our friends, am denied all peace of mind by beholding thee<br>on the bare earth in this sorry condition. The wicked Duryodhana, the<br>most infamous of his race, has, with all his troops and his brothers,<br>perished in battle, in the observance of Kshatriya duties. That<br>wicked-souled wight does not see thee lying on the ground. Verily, for<br>this reason, I would deem death to be preferable to life. O hero that<br>never swervest from virtue, had I with my brothers met with destruction<br>ere this at the hands of our enemies on the battle-field, I would not<br>have found thee in this pitiful plight, thus pierced with arrows. Surely,<br>O prince, the Maker had created is to become perpetrators of evil deeds.<br>O king, if thou wishest to do me good, do thou then instruct me in such a<br>way that I may be cleansed of this sin in even another world.'<br><br>"Bhishma replied, 'Why, O fortunate one, dost thou consider thy soul,<br>which is dependent (on God and Destiny and Time) to be the cause of thy<br>actions? The manifestation of its inaction is subtle and imperceptible to<br>the senses. In this connection is cited the ancient story of the<br>conversation between Mrityu and Gautami with Kala and the Fowler and the<br>serpent. There was, O son of Kunti, an old lady of the name of Gautami,<br>who was possessed of great patience and tranquillity of mind. One day she<br>found her son dead in consequence of having been bitten by a serpent. An<br>angry fowler, by name Arjunaka, bound the serpent with a string and<br>brought it before Gautami. He then said to her,&#8212;This wretched serpent<br>has been the cause of thy son's death, O blessed lady. Tell me quickly<br>how this wretch is to be destroyed. Shall I throw it into the fire or<br>shall I hack it into pieces? This infamous destroyer of a child does not<br>deserve to live longer.'<br><br>"Gautami replied, 'Do thou, O Arjunaka of little understanding, release<br>this serpent. It doth not deserve death at thy hands. Who is so foolish<br>as to disregard the inevitable lot that awaits him and burdening himself<br>with such folly sink into sin? Those that have made themselves light by<br>the practice of virtuous deeds, manage to cross the sea of the world even<br>as a ship crosses the ocean. But those that have made themselves heavy<br>with sin sink into the bottom, even as an arrow thrown into the water. By<br>killing the serpent, this my boy will not be restored to life, and by<br>letting it live, no harm will be caused to thee. Who would go to the<br>interminable regions of Death by slaying this living creature?'<br><br>"The fowler said, 'I know, O lady that knowest the difference between<br>right and wrong, that the great are afflicted at the afflictions of all<br>creatures. But these words which thou hast spoken are fraught with<br>instruction for only a self-contained person (and not for one plunged in<br>sorrow). Therefore, I must kill this serpent. Those who value peace of<br>mind, assign everything to the course of Time as the cause, but practical<br>men soon assuage their grief (by revenge). People through constant<br>delusion, fear loss of beatitude (in the next world for acts like these).<br>therefore, O lady, assuage thy grief by having this serpent destroyed (by<br>me).<br><br>"Gautami replied, 'People like us are never afflicted by (such<br>misfortune). Good men have their souls always intent on virtue. The death<br>of the boy was predestined: therefore, I am unable to approve of the<br>destruction of this serpent. Brahmanas do not harbour resentment, because<br>resentment leads to pain. Do thou, O good man, forgive and release this<br>serpent out of compassion.'<br><br>"The fowler replied, 'Let us earn great and inexhaustible merit hereafter<br>by killing (this creature), even as a man acquires great merit, and<br>confers it on his victim sacrificed as well, by sacrifice upon the altar.<br>Merit is acquired by killing an enemy: by killing this despicable<br>creature, thou shalt acquire great and true merit hereafter.'<br><br>"Gautami replied, 'What good is there in tormenting and killing an enemy,<br>and what good is won by not releasing an enemy in our power? Therefore, O<br>thou of benign countenance, why should we not forgive this serpent and<br>try to earn merit by releasing it?'<br><br>"The fowler replied, 'A great number (of creatures) ought to be protected<br>from (the wickedness of) this one, instead of this single creature being<br>protected (in preference to many). Virtuous men abandon the vicious (to<br>their doom): do thou, therefore, kill this wicked creature.'<br><br>"Gautami replied, 'By killing this serpent, O fowler, my son will not be<br>restored to life, nor do I see that any other end will be attained by its<br>death: therefore, do thou, O fowler, release this living creature of a<br>serpent.<br><br>"The fowler said, 'By killing Vritra, Indra secured the best portion (of<br>sacrificial offerings), and by destroying a sacrifice Mahadeva secured<br>his share of sacrificial offerings: do thou, therefore, destroy this<br>serpent immediately without any misgivings in thy mind!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The high-souled Gautami, although repeatedly incited<br>by the fowler for the destruction of the serpent did not bend her mind to<br>that sinful act. The serpent, painfully bound with the cord: sighing a<br>little and maintaining its composure with great difficulty, then uttered<br>these words slowly, in a human voice.'<br><br>"The serpent said, 'O foolish Arjunaka, what fault is there of mine? I<br>have no will of my own, and am not independent. Mrityu sent me on this<br>errand. By his direction have I bitten this child, and not out of any<br>anger or choice on my part. Therefore, if there be any sin in this, O<br>fowler, the sin is his.'<br><br>"The fowler said, 'If thou hast done this evil, led thereto by another,<br>the sin is thine also as thou art an instrument in the act. As in the<br>making of an earthen vessel the potter's wheel and rod and other things<br>are all regarded as causes, so art thou, O serpent, (cause in the<br>production of this effect). He that is guilty deserves death at my hands.<br>Thou, O serpent, art guilty. Indeed, thou confessest thyself so in this<br>matter!'<br><br>"The serpent said, 'As all these, viz., the potter's wheel, rod, and<br>other things, are not independent causes, even so I am not an independent<br>cause. Therefore, this is no fault of mine, as thou shouldst grant.<br>Shouldst thou think otherwise, then these are to be considered as causes<br>working in unison with one another. For thus working with one other, a<br>doubt arises regarding their relation as cause and effect. Such being the<br>case, it is no fault of mine, nor do I deserve death on this account, nor<br>am I guilty of any sin. Or, if thou thinkest that there is sin (in even<br>such causation), the sin lies in the aggregate of causes.'<br><br>"The fowler said, 'If thou art neither the prime cause nor the agent in<br>this matter, thou art still the cause of the death (of his child).<br>Therefore, thou dost deserve death in my opinion. If, O serpent, thou<br>thinkest that when an evil act is done, the doer is not implicated<br>therein, then there can be no cause in this matter; but having done this,<br>verily thou deservest death. What more dost thou think?'<br><br>"The serpent said, 'Whether any cause exists or not,[1] no effect is<br>produced without an (intermediate) act. Therefore, causation being of no<br>moment in either case, my agency only as the cause (in this matter) ought<br>to be considered in its proper bearings. If, O fowler, thou thinkest me<br>to be the cause in truth, then the guilt of this act of killing a living<br>being rests on the shoulders of another who incited me to this end.'[2]<br><br>"The fowler said, 'Not deserving of life, O foolish one, why dost thou<br>bandy so many words, O wretch of a serpent? Thou deservest death at my<br>hands. Thou hast done an atrocious act by killing this infant.'<br><br>"The serpent said, 'O fowler, as the officiating priests at a sacrifice<br>do not acquire the merit of the act by offering oblations of clarified<br>butter to the fire, even so should I be regarded with respect as to the<br>result in this connection.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The serpent directed by Mrityu having said this,<br>Mrityu himself appeared there and addressing the serpent spoke thus.<br><br>"Mrityu said, 'Guided. by Kala, I, O serpent, sent thee on this errand,<br>and neither art thou nor am I the cause of this child's death. Even as<br>the clouds are tossed hither and thither by the wind, I am like the<br>clouds, O serpent, influenced by Kala. All attitudes appertaining to<br>Sattwa or Rajas, or Tamas, are provoked by Kala, and operate in all<br>creatures. All creatures, mobile and immobile, in heaven, or earth, are<br>influenced by Kala. The whole universe, O serpent, is imbued with this<br>same influence of Kala. All acts in this world and all abstentions, as<br>also all their modifications, are said to be influenced by Kala, Surya,<br>Soma, Vishnu, Water, Wind, the deity of a hundred sacrificer, Fire, Sky,<br>Earth, Mitra and Parjanya, Aditi, and the Vasus, Rivers and Oceans, all<br>existent and non-existent objects, are created and destroyed by Kala.<br>Knowing this, why dost thou, O serpent, consider me to be guilty? If any<br>fault attaches to me in this, thou also wouldst be to blame.'<br><br>"The serpent said, 'I do not, O Mrityu, blame thee, nor do I absolve thee<br>from all blame. I only aver that I am directed and influenced (in my<br>actions) by thee. If any blame attaches to Kala, or, if it be not<br>desirable to attach any blame to him, it is not for me to scan the fault.<br>We have no right to do so. As it is incumbent on me to absolve myself<br>from this blame, so it is my duty to see that no blame attaches to<br>Mrityu.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Then the serpent, addressing Arjunaka, said&#8212;Thou<br>hast listened to what Mrityu has said. Therefore, it is not proper for<br>thee to torment me, who am guiltless, by tying me with this cord.'<br><br>"The fowler said, 'I have listened to thee, O serpent, as well as to the<br>words of Mrityu, but these, O serpent, do not absolve thee from all<br>blame. Mrityu and thyself are the causes of the child's death. I consider<br>both of you to be the cause and I do not call that to be the cause which<br>is not truly so. Accursed be the wicked and vengeful Mrityu that causes<br>affliction to the good. Thee too I shall kill that art sinful and<br>engaged, in sinful acts!'<br><br>"Mrityu said, 'We both are not free agents, but are dependent on Kala,<br>and ordained to do our appointed work. Thou shouldst not find fault with<br>us if thou dost consider this matter thoroughly.'<br><br>"The fowler said, 'If ye both, O serpent and Mrityu, be dependent on<br>Kala, I am curious to know how pleasure (arising from doing good) and<br>anger (arising from doing evil) are caused.'<br><br>"Mrityu said, 'Whatever is done is done under the influence of Kala. I<br>have said it before, O fowler, that Kala is the cause of all and that for<br>this reason we both, acting under the inspiration of Kala, do our<br>appointed work and therefore, O fowler, we two do not deserve censure<br>from thee in any way!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Then Kala arrived at that scene of disputation on<br>this point of morality, and spoke thus to the serpent and Mrityu and the<br>fowler Arjunaka assembled together.'<br><br>"Kala said, 'Neither Mrityu, nor this serpent, nor I, O fowler, am guilty<br>of the death of any creature. We are merely the immediate exciting causes<br>of the event. O Arjunaka, the Karma of this child formed the exciting<br>cause of our action in this matter. There was no other cause by which<br>this child came by its death. It was killed as a result of its own Karma.<br>It has met with death as the result of its Karma in the past. Its Karma<br>has been the cause of its destruction. We all are subject to the<br>influence of our respective Karma. Karma is an aid to salvation even as<br>sons are, and Karma also is an indicator of virtue and vice in man. We<br>urge one another even as acts urge one another. As men make from a lump<br>of clay whatever they wish to make, even so do men attain to various<br>results determined by Karma. As light and shadow are related to each<br>other, so are men related to Karma through their own actions. Therefore,<br>neither art thou, nor am I, nor Mrityu, nor the serpent, nor this old<br>Brahmana lady, is the cause of this child's death. He himself is the<br>cause here. Upon Kala, O king, expounding the matter in this way,<br>Gautami, convinced in her mind that men suffer according to their<br>actions, spoke thus to Arjunaka.'<br><br>"Gautami said, 'Neither Kala, nor Mrityu, nor the serpent, is the cause<br>in this matter. This child has met with death as the result of its own<br>Karma. I too so acted (in the past) that my son has died (as its<br>consequence). Let now Kala and Mrityu retire from this place, and do thou<br>too, O Arjunaka, release this serpent.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Then Kala and Mrityu and the serpent went back to<br>their respective destinations, and Gautami became consoled in mind as<br>also the fowler. Having heard all this, O king, do thou forego all grief,<br>and attain to peace of mind. Men attain to heaven or hell as the result<br>of their own Karma. This evil has neither been of thy own creation, nor<br>of Duryodhana's. Know this that these lords of Earth have all been slain<br>(in this war) as a result of acts of Kalas.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Having heard all this, the powerful and virtuous<br>Yudhishthira became consoled in mind, and again enquired as follows."
