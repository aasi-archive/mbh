                            "Yudhishthira said, 'If, O prince, Brahmanahood be so difficult of<br>attainment by the three classes (Kshatriyas, Vaisyas and Sudras), how<br>then did the high souled Viswamitra, O king, though a Kshatriya (by<br>birth), attain to the status of a Brahmana? I desire to know this, O<br>sire. Therefore, do thou truly relate this matter to me. That powerful<br>man, O sire, by virtue of his austerities, destroyed in a moment the<br>hundred sons of the high-souled Vasishtha. While under the influence of<br>anger, he created numerous evil spirits and Rakshasas of mighty vigour<br>and resembling the great destroyer Kala himself. The great and learned<br>race of Kusika, numbering hundreds of regenerate sages and belauded by<br>the Brahmanas, was founded in this world of men by him. Sunasepha of<br>austere penances, the son of Richika, having been sought to be slain as<br>an animal in the great sacrifice of Amvarisha, obtained his deliverance<br>through Viswamitra. Harishchandra, having pleased the gods at a<br>sacrifice, became a son of the wise Viswamitra. For not having honoured<br>their eldest brother Devarat, whom Viswamitra got as a son from the gods,<br>the other fifty brothers of his were cursed, and all of them became<br>Chandalas. Trisanku, the son of Ikshwaku, through the curse of Vasistha<br>became a Chandala, and when abandoned by his friends, and remaining<br>suspended with his head downwards in the lower regions, was translated to<br>heaven at the pleasure of Viswamitra. Viswamitra had a large river, by<br>name Kausika, that was frequented by celestial Rishis. This sacred and<br>auspicious stream was frequented by the gods and regenerate Rishis. For<br>disturbing his devotions, the famous celestial nymph Rambha of fine<br>bracelets, was cursed and metamorphosed into a rock. Through fear of<br>Viswamitra the glorious Vasishtha, in olden times, binding himself with<br>creepers, threw himself down into a river and again rose released from<br>his bonds. In consequence of this, that large and sacred river become<br>thenceforth celebrated by the name of Vipasa.[3] He prayed to the<br>glorious and puissant Indra who was pleased with him and absolved him<br>from a curse.[4] Remaining on the northern side of the firmament, he<br>sheds his lustre from a position in the midst of the seven regenerate<br>Rishis,[5] and Dhruva the son of Uttanpada[6]. These are his achievements<br>as well as many others. O descendant of Kuru, as they were performed by a<br>Kshatriya, my curiosity has been roused in this matter. Therefore, O<br>foremost one of Bharata's race, do thou relate this matter to me truly.<br>How without casting off his corporeal frame and taking another tenement<br>of flesh could he become a Brahmana? Do thou, O sire, truly relate this<br>matter to me as thou hast related to me the story of Matanga. Matanga was<br>born as a Chandala,[7] and could not attain to Brahmanahood,(with all his<br>austerities) but how could this man attain to the status of a Brahmana?"
