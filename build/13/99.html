                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I have, O chief of the Bharatas, heard what the<br>merits are that are won by presenters of flowers and incense and lights.<br>I have heard thee speak also of the merits that attach to a due<br>observance of the ordinances in respect of the presentation of the Vali.<br>It behoveth thee, O grandsire, to discourse unto me once more on this<br>subject. Indeed, tell me, O sire, once more of the merits of presenting<br>incense and lights. Why are Valis offered on the ground by persons<br>leading the domestic mode of life?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is recited the old narrative of the<br>discourse between Nahusha and Agastya and Bhrigu. The royal sage Nahusha,<br>O monarch, possessed of wealth of penances, acquired the sovereignty of<br>Heaven by his own good deeds. With restrained senses, O king, he dwelt in<br>Heaven, engaged in doing diverse acts of both human and celestial nature.<br>From that high-souled monarch flowed diverse kinds of human acts and<br>diverse kinds of celestial acts also, O chief of men. The diverse rites<br>with respect to the sacrificial fire, the collection of sacred fuel and<br>of Kusa grass, as also of flowers, and the presentation of Vali<br>consisting of food adorned with fried paddy (reduced to powder), and the<br>offer of incense and of light,&#8212;all these, O monarch, occurred daily in<br>the abode of that high-souled king while he dwelt in heaven. Indeed,<br>though dwelling in heaven, he performed the sacrifice of Japa (or silent<br>recitation) and the sacrifice of meditation. And, O chastiser of foes,<br>Nahusha, although he had become the chief of the deities, yet worshipped<br>all the deities, as he used to do in days of yore, with due rites and<br>ceremonies. Some time after, Nahusha realised his position as the chief<br>of all the deities. This filled him with pride. From that time all his<br>acts (of the kind spoken of) were suspended. Filled with arrogance in<br>consequence of the boon he had received from all the deities, Nahusha<br>caused the very Rishis to bear him on their shoulders. In consequence,<br>however, of his abstention from all religious acts, his energy began to<br>sustain a diminution. The time was very long for which Nahusha filled<br>with pride, continued to employ the foremost of Rishis, possessed of<br>wealth of penances, as the bearers of his vehicles. He caused the Rishis<br>to discharge by turns his humiliating work. The day came when it was<br>Agastya's turn to bear the vehicles, O Bharata. At that time, Bhrigu,<br>that foremost of all persons conversant with Brahma, repaired to the<br>presence of Agastya while the latter was seated in his asylum, and<br>addressing him, said, 'O great ascetic, why should we patiently put up<br>with such indignity inflicted on us by this wicked-souled Nahusha who has<br>become the chief of the deities?'<br><br>"Agastya said, 'How can I succeed in cursing Nahusha, O great Rishi? It<br>is known to thee how the boon-giving (Brahman) himself has given Nahusha<br>the best of boons! Coming to heaven, the boon that Nahusha solicited was<br>that whoever would come within the range of his vision would, deprived of<br>all energy, come within his sway. The self-born Brahman granted him even<br>this boon, and it is for that reason that neither thyself nor I have been<br>able to consume him. Without doubt, is for this reason that none else<br>amongst the foremost of Rishis has been able to consume or hurl him down<br>from his high position, Formerly, O Lord, nectar was given by Brahman to<br>Nahusha for quaffing. For that reason also we have become powerless<br>against him. The supreme deity, it seems, gave that boon to Nahusha for<br>plunging all creatures into grief. That wretch among men behaves most<br>unrighteously towards the Brahmanas. O foremost of all speakers, do thou<br>tell us what should be done in view of the situation. Without doubt, I<br>shall do what thou wilt advise.'<br><br>"Bhrigu said, 'It is at the command of the Grandsire that I have come to<br>thee with the view of counteracting the puissance of Nahusha who is<br>possessed of great energy but who has been stupefied by fate. That<br>exceedingly wicked-souled wight who has become the chief of the deities<br>will today yoke thee to his car. With the aid of my energy I shall today<br>hurl him down from his position as Indra in consequence of his having<br>transcended all restraints! I shall today, in thy very sight,<br>re-establish the true Indra in his position&#8212;him, viz., who has performed<br>a hundred horse-sacrifices,&#8212;having hurled the wicked-souled and sinful<br>Nahusha from that seat! That unrighteous chief of the deities will today<br>insult thee by a kick, in consequence of his understanding being<br>afflicted by fate and for bringing about his own downfall. Incensed at<br>such an insult I shall today curse that sinful wretch, that enemy of the<br>Brahmanas, that has transcended all restraints, saying, 'Be thou<br>transformed into a snake!' In the very sight, O great ascetic, I shall<br>today hurl down on the earth the wicked-souled Nahusha who shall be<br>deprived of all energy in consequence of the cries of 'Fie' that will be<br>uttered from all sides.[445] Verily, I shall hurl down Nahusha today,<br>that wight of unrighteous deeds, who has, besides, been stupefied by<br>lordship and power. I shall do this, if it be acceptable to thee, O<br>ascetic! Thus addressed by Bhrigu, Mitravaruna's son Agastya of unfading<br>puissance and glory, became highly gratified and freed from every<br>anxiety.'"
