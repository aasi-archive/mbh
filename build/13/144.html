                            "Uma said, 'O holy one, O Lord of all beings, O thou that art worshipped<br>by the deities and Asuras equally, tell me what are the duties and<br>derelictions of men. Indeed, O puissant one, resolve my doubts. It is by<br>these three, viz., thought, word, and deed, that men become bound with<br>bonds. It is by these same three that they become freed from those bonds.<br>By pursuing what conduct, O god,&#8212;indeed, by what kind of acts,&#8212;by what<br>behaviour and attributes and words, do men succeed in ascending to<br>heaven?'<br><br>"The god of gods said, 'O goddess, thou art well-conversant with the true<br>import of duties. Thou art ever devoted to righteousness and<br>self-restraint. The question thou hast asked me is fraught with the<br>benefit of all creatures. It enhances the intelligence of all persons. Do<br>thou, therefore, listen to the answer. Those persons that are devoted to<br>the religion of Truth, that are righteous and destitute of the<br>indications of the several modes of life, and that enjoy the wealth<br>earned by righteous means, succeed in ascending to heaven. Those men that<br>are freed from all doubts, that are possessed of omniscience, and that<br>have eyes to behold all things, are never enchained by either virtue or<br>sin. Those men that are freed from all attachments can never be bound by<br>the chains of action. They who never injure others in thought, word, or<br>deed, and who never attach themselves to anything, can never be bound by<br>acts. They who abstain from taking the lives of any creature, who are<br>pious in conduct, who have compassion, who regard friends and foes in an<br>equal light and who are self-restrained, can never be bound by acts.<br>Those men that are endued with compassion towards all beings, that<br>succeed in inspiring the confidence of all living creatures, and that<br>have cast off malice in their behaviour, succeed in ascending to heaven.<br>Those men that have no desire to appropriate what belongs to others, that<br>keep themselves aloof from the wedded wives of others, and that enjoy<br>only such wealth as has been earned by righteous means, succeed in<br>ascending to heaven. Those men who behave towards the wives of other<br>people as towards their own mothers and sisters and daughters, succeed in<br>attaining to heaven. Those men that abstain from appropriating what<br>belongs to others, that are perfectly contented with what they possess,<br>and that live depending upon their own destiny, succeed in ascending to<br>heaven. Those men that, in their conduct, always shut their eyes against<br>association with other people's spouses, that are masters of their<br>senses, and that are devoted to righteous conduct, succeed in ascending<br>to heaven. Even this is the path, created by the gods, that the righteous<br>should follow. This is the path, freed from passion and aversion, laid<br>down for the righteous to follow. Those men who are devoted to their own<br>spouses and who seek them only in their seasons, and who turn themselves<br>away from indulgence in sexual pleasure, succeed in ascending to Heaven<br>Conduct marked by charity and penances, and characterised by<br>righteousness of deeds and purity of both body and heart, should be<br>followed by those that are wise for the sake of adding to their merit or<br>for earning their means of subsistence. Those who wish to ascend to<br>Heaven should follow in this track and not in any other.'<br><br>"Uma said, 'Tell me, O illustrious deity, O sinless lord of all<br>creatures, what are those words by which one becomes enchained and what<br>are those words by uttering which one may be freed from one's bonds.'<br><br>"Maheswara said, 'Those men who never tell lies for either themselves or<br>for others, or in jest or for exciting laughter, succeed in ascending to<br>Heaven. They who never tell lies for earning their subsistence or for<br>earning merit or through mere caprice, succeed in ascending to Heaven.<br>They who utter words that are smooth and sweet and faultless, and who<br>welcome all whom they meet with sincerity, succeed in ascending to<br>Heaven. They who never utter words that are harsh and bitter and cruel.<br>and who are free from deceitfulness and evil of every kind, succeed in<br>ascending to Heaven. Those men who never utter words that are fraught<br>with deceit or that cause breach of understanding between friends, and<br>who always speak what is true and what promotes good feelings, succeed in<br>ascending to Heaven. Those men who avoid harsh speeches and abstain from<br>quarrels with others, who are impartial in their behaviour to all<br>creatures, and who have subjugated their souls, succeed in ascending to<br>Heaven. They who abstain from evil speech or sinful conversation, who<br>avoid such speeches as are disagreeable, and who utter only such words as<br>are auspicious and agreeable, succeed in ascending to Heaven. They who<br>never utter, under anger, such words as tear the hearts of other people,<br>and who, even when under the influence of wrath, speak words that are<br>peaceful and agreeable, succeed in ascending to Heaven. The religion, O<br>goddess, appertaining to speech, should always be followed by men. It is<br>auspicious and characterised by truth. They that are possessed of wisdom<br>should always avoid untruth.'<br><br>"Uma said, 'Do thou tell me, O god of gods, O wielder of Pinaka, O thou<br>that art highly blessed, what those mental acts or thoughts are by which<br>a person may be enchained.'<br><br>"Maheswara said, 'Endued with merit that arises from mental acts, O<br>goddess, one ascends to Heaven. Listen to me, O auspicious one, as I<br>recite to thee what those acts are. Listen to me, O thou of sweet face,<br>how also a mind of ill-regulated features becomes enchained by<br>ill-regulated or evil thoughts. Those men who do not seek even mentally,<br>to take what belongs to others even when they see it lying in a lone<br>forest, succeed in ascending to Heaven. Those men who care not to<br>appropriate what belongs to others even when they see it lying in a house<br>or a village that has been deserted, ascend to Heaven. Those men that do<br>not seek, even mentally, to associate with the wedded spouses of others<br>even when they behold them in deserted places and under the influence of<br>desire, succeed in ascending to Heaven. Those men who, meeting with<br>friends or foes, behave in the same friendly way towards all, succeed in<br>ascending to Heaven. Those men that are possessed of learning and<br>compassion, that are pure in body and mind, that are firm in their<br>adherence to truth, and that are contented with what belongs to them,<br>succeed in ascending to Heaven. Those men that do not bear ill-will to<br>any creature, that do not stand in need of labour for their subsistence,<br>that bear friendly hearts towards all beings, and that entertain<br>compassion towards all, succeed in ascending to Heaven. Those men that<br>are endued with faith, that have compassion, that are holy, that seek the<br>company of holy men, and that are conversant with the distinctions<br>between right and wrong, succeed in ascending to Heaven. Those men, O<br>goddess, that are conversant with what the consequences are of good and<br>bad deeds, succeed in ascending to Heaven. Those men that are just in all<br>their dealings, that are endued with all desirable accomplishments, that<br>are devoted to the deities and the Brahmanas, and that are endued with<br>perseverance in the doing of good acts, succeed in ascending to Heaven.<br>All these men, O goddess, succeed in ascending to Heaven through the<br>meritorious consequences of their deeds. What else dost thou wish to<br>hear?'<br><br>"Uma said, 'I have a great doubt, O Maheswara, on a subject connected<br>with human beings. It behoveth thee to explain it to me carefully. By<br>what acts does a man succeed, O puissant deity, in acquiring a long life?<br>By what penances also does one acquire a long life? By what acts does one<br>become shortlived on earth? O thou that art perfectly stainless, it<br>behoveth thee to tell me what the consequences are of acts (in the matter<br>of bestowing a long or a short life on the doer). Some are seen to be<br>possessed of great good fortune and some weighted with misfortune. Some<br>are of noble birth while others of ignoble birth. Some are of such<br>repulsive features as if they are made of wood, while others are of very<br>agreeable features at even the first sight. Some appear to be destitute<br>of wisdom while others are possessed of it. Some, again, are seen endued<br>with high intelligence and wisdom, enlightened by knowledge and science.<br>Some have to endure little pain, while others there are that are weighted<br>with heavy calamities. Even such diverse sights are seen with respect to<br>men. It behoveth thee, O illustrious one, to tell me the reason of all<br>this.'<br><br>"The god of gods said, 'Verily, O goddess, I shall discourse to thee on<br>the manifestation of the fruits of acts. It is by the rules of that<br>manifestation that all human beings in this world enjoy or endure the<br>consequences of their acts. That man who assumes a fierce aspect for the<br>purpose of taking the lives of other creatures, who arms himself with<br>stout sticks for injuring other creatures, who is seen with uplifted<br>weapons, who slays living creatures, who is destitute of compassion, who<br>always causes agitation to living beings, who refuses to grant protection<br>to even worms and ants, who is endued with cruelty,&#8212;one who is such, O<br>goddess, sinks in Hell. One who is endued with an opposite disposition<br>and who is righteous in acts, is born as a handsome man. The man who is<br>endued with cruelty, goes to Hell, while he that is endued with<br>compassion ascends to Heaven. The man who goes to Hell has to endure<br>excruciating misery. One who, having sunk in Hell, rises therefrom, take<br>birth as a man endued with short life. That man who is addicted to<br>slaughter and injury, O goddess, becomes, through his sinful deeds,<br>liable to destruction. Such a person becomes disagreeable to all<br>creatures and endued with a short life. That man who belongs to what is<br>called the White class, who abstains from the slaughter of living<br>creatures, who has thrown away all weapons, who never inflicts any<br>chastisement on any body, who never injures any creatures, who never<br>causes any body to slay creatures for him, who never slays or strikes<br>even when struck or attempted to be slain, who never sanctions or<br>approves an act of slaughter, who is endued with compassion towards all<br>creatures, who behaves towards others as towards his own self,&#8212;such a<br>superior man, O goddess, succeeds in attaining to the status of a deity.<br>Filled with joy, such a man enjoys diverse kinds of luxurious articles.<br>If such a person ever takes birth in the world of men, he becomes endued<br>with longevity and enjoys great happiness. Even this is the way of those<br>that are of righteous conduct and righteous deeds and that are blessed<br>with longevity, the way that was indicated by the Self-born Brahman<br>himself and that is characterised by abstention from the slaughter of<br>living creatures.'"
