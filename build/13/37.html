                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Which amongst these three persons, O grandsire,<br>should be regarded as the best for making gifts unto, viz., one who is a<br>thorough stranger, or one who is living with and who has been known to<br>the giver for a long time, or one who presents himself before the giver,<br>coming from a long distance?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'All these are equal. The eligibility of some consists in<br>their soliciting alms for performing sacrifices or for paying the<br>preceptor's fee or for maintaining their spouses and children. The<br>eligibility of some for receiving gifts, consists in their following the<br>vow of wandering over the earth, never soliciting anything but receiving<br>when given. We should also give unto one what one seeks.[268] We should,<br>however, make gifts without afflicting those that depend upon us. Even<br>this is what we have heard. By afflicting one's dependants, one afflicts<br>one's own self. The stranger,&#8212;one, that is, who has come for the first<br>time,&#8212;should be regarded as a proper object of gifts. He who is familiar<br>and well-known and has been living with the giver, should be regarded in<br>the same light. The learned know that he too who comes from a distant<br>place should be regarded in an equal light.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'It is true that we should make gifts unto others<br>without afflicting anyone and without doing violence to the ordinances of<br>the scriptures. One should, however, correctly ascertain who the person<br>is that should be regarded as a proper object for making gifts. He should<br>be such that the gift itself, by being made over to him, may not<br>grieve.'[269]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'If the Ritwik, the Purohita, the preceptor, the Acharya,<br>the disciple, the relative (by marriage), and kinsmen, happen to be<br>possessed of learning and free from malice, then should they be deemed<br>worthy of respect and worship. Those persons that do not possess such<br>qualifications cannot be regarded as worthy of gifts or hospitality.<br>Hence, one should with deliberation examine persons with whom one comes<br>into contact. Absence of wrath, truthfulness of speech, abstention from<br>injury, sincerity, peacefulness of conduct, the absence of pride,<br>modesty, renunciation, self-restraint, and tranquillity or contentment of<br>soul, he in whom these occur by nature, and in whom there are no wicked<br>acts, should be regarded as a proper object. Such a person deserves<br>honours. Whether the person he one who is well-known and familiar, or one<br>who has come newly, whether he has not been seen before, if he happens to<br>possess these qualifications, he should be regarded as worthy of honours<br>and hospitality. He who denies the authority of the Vedas, or strives to<br>show that the scriptures should be disregarded, or approves of all<br>breaches or restraint in society,&#8212;simply brings about his own ruin (and<br>should not be regarded as worthy of gifts). That Brahmana who is vain of<br>his learning, who speaks ill of the Vedas or who is devoted to the<br>science of useless disputation, or who is desirous of gaining victory (in<br>disputations) in assemblies of good men by disproving the reasons that<br>exist for morality and religion and ascribing everything to chance, or<br>who indulges in censuring and reproaching others or who reproves<br>Brahmanas, or who is suspicious of all persons, or who is foolish and<br>bereft of judgment, or who is bitter of speech, should be known to be as<br>hateful as a dog. As a dog encounters others, barking the while and<br>seeking to bite, such a person is even so, for he spends his breath in<br>vain and seeks to destroy the authority of all the scriptures. Those<br>practices that support society, the duties of righteousness, and all<br>those acts which are productive of benefit to one's own self, should be<br>attended to. A person that lives, attending to these, grows in prosperity<br>for everlasting time. By paying off the debt one owes to the deities by<br>performing sacrifices, that to the Rishis by studying the Vedas, that to<br>the Pitris by procreating children, that to the Brahmanas by making<br>presents unto them and that to guests by feeding them, in due order, and<br>with purity of intention, and properly attending to the ordinances of the<br>scriptures, a householder does not fall away from righteousness.'"[270]
