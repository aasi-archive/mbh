                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Man, it is said, is endued with a period of life<br>extending for a hundred years, and with energy and might that are<br>considerable. Why then, O grandsire, do human beings die even when they<br>are very young? By what does a man become endued with longevity, and by<br>what is his life shortened? Through what does a man acquire the fame that<br>rests upon great achievements? Through what does one attain to wealth and<br>prosperity? Is it by penances, or Brahmacharya, or silent recitation of<br>sacred Mantras, or drugs? Is it by his acts, or speech? Do thou explain<br>to me this, O grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall tell thee what thou askest me. In fact, I shall<br>tell thee what the reason is for which one becomes shortlived, and what<br>the reason is for which one becomes endued with longevity. I shall also<br>explain to thee the reason for which one succeeds in acquiring the fame<br>that rests on great achievements, and the reason for which one succeeds<br>in acquiring wealth and prosperity. Indeed, I shall enlighten thee as to<br>the manner in which one must live in order to be endued with all that is<br>beneficial for him. It is by conduct that one acquires longevity, and it<br>is by conduct that one acquires wealth and prosperity. Indeed, it is by<br>conduct that one acquires the fame that rests upon great achievements<br>both here and hereafter. The man whose conduct is improper or wicked<br>never acquires a long life. All creatures become afraid of such a man and<br>are oppressed by him. If, therefore, one wishes one's own advancement and<br>prosperity, one should, in this world, betake to conduct that is proper<br>and good. Good conduct succeeds in dispelling the inauspiciousness and<br>misery of even one that is sinful.[457] Righteousness has conduct for its<br>indication. They that are good and righteous are so in consequence of the<br>conduct they follow. The indications, again, of good conduct are afforded<br>by the acts of those that are good or righteous. People esteem that man<br>who acts righteously and who does good acts even if they only hear of him<br>without actually seeing him. They that are atheists, they that are<br>destitute of all acts, they that are disobedient to preceptors and<br>transgress the injunctions of the scriptures, they that are unacquainted<br>with and, therefore, unobservant of duties, and they that are wicked of<br>conduct, become shortlived. They that are of improper behaviour, they<br>that transgress all restraints, they that are unscrupulous in respect of<br>sexual congress, become shortlived here and have to go to Hell hereafter.<br>Even those men live for a hundred years who, though destitute of all<br>accomplishments, betake themselves to propriety and righteousness of<br>conduct and become endued with faith and freed from malice. He that is<br>free from wrath, that is truthful in speech, that never does any injury<br>to any creature in the universe, that is divested of malice and<br>crookedness and insincerity, succeeds in living for a hundred years. He<br>who always breaks little clods of earth, or tears up the grass that grows<br>under his feet, or cuts off his nails with his teeth, or is always<br>impure, or very restless, never succeeds in acquiring a long life.[458]<br>One should wake up from sleep at the hour known as the Brahma Muhurta and<br>then think of both religion and profit. Getting up from bed, one should<br>then wash one's face and mouth, and joining one's hands in an attitude of<br>reverence, say the morning prayers.[459] In this way, one should when<br>evening comes, say one's evening prayers also, restraining speech (with<br>other people) the while. One should never look at the rising sun, nor at<br>the setting sun.[460] Nor should one look at the sun when he is in<br>eclipse; nor at his image in the water; nor at midday when he is at the<br>meridian. The Rishis, in consequence of their adoring the two twilights<br>with great regularity succeeded in attaining to longevity. Hence, one<br>should, restraining speech, say one's prayers regularly at the two<br>twilights. As regards those Brahmanas that do not say their prayers at<br>the two twilights, a righteous king should set them to accomplish such<br>acts as are ordained for the Sudras. Persons of every order should never<br>have sexual congress with other people's wives. There is nothing that<br>shortens life so effectually as sexual congress with other people's<br>wives. For as many thousand years shall the adulterer have to live in<br>Hell as the number of pores on the bodies of the women with whom he may<br>commit the offence. One should dress one's hair, apply collyrium to one's<br>eyes, and wash one's teeth, as also worship the deities, in the forenoon.<br>One should not gaze at urine or faeces, or tread on it or touch it with<br>one's feet. One should not set out on a journey at early dawn, or at<br>midday, or in the evening twilight, or with a companion that is unknown,<br>or with a Sudra, or alone. While going along a road, one should, standing<br>aside, always make way to a Brahmana, to kine, to kings, to an old man,<br>to one that is weighted with a burden, to a woman quick with child, or to<br>one that is weak. When one meets a large tree that is known, one should<br>walk round it. One should also, when coming upon a spot where four roads<br>meet, walk round it before pursuing one's journey. At midday, or at<br>midnight, or at night in general, or at the two twilights, one should not<br>proceed to spots where four roads meet. One should never wear sandals or<br>clothes that have been worn by another. One should always observe the vow<br>of Brahmacharya, and should never cross one's legs. One should observe<br>the vow of Brahmacharya on the day of the new moon, as also on that of<br>the full moon, as also on the eighth lunar day of both fortnights. One<br>should never eat the flesh of animals not slain in sacrifice. One should<br>never eat the flesh of the back of an animal. One should avoid censuring<br>and calumniating others, as also all kinds of deceitful behaviour.[461]<br>One should never pierce others with wordy shafts. Indeed, one should<br>never utter any cruel speech. One should never accept a gift from a<br>person that is low and vulgar. One should never jitter such words as<br>trouble other people or as are inauspicious or are as' sinful. Wordy<br>shafts fall from the mouth. Pierced therewith, the victim grieves day and<br>night. The man of wisdom should never shot them for piercing the vitals<br>of other people. A forest, pierced with shafts or cut down with the axe,<br>grows again. The man, however, that is pierced with words unwisely<br>spoken, becomes the victim of wounds that fester and lead to death.[462]<br>Barbed arrows and Nalikas and broadheaded shafts are capable of being<br>extracted from the body. Wordy shafts, however, are incapable of being<br>extracted, for they lie embedded in the very heart. One should not taunt<br>a person that is defective of a limb or that has a limb in excess, or one<br>that is destitute of learning, or one that is miserable, or one that is<br>ugly or poor, or one that is destitute of strength. One should avoid<br>atheism, calumniating the Vedas, censuring the deities, malice, pride,<br>arrogance, and harshness. One should not, in wrath, take up the rod of<br>chastisement for laying it upon another. Only the son or the pupil, it<br>has been said, can be mildly chastised for purposes of instruction. One<br>should not speak ill of Brahmanas; nor should he point at the stars with<br>one's fingers. If asked, one should not say what the lunation is on a<br>particular day. By telling it, one's life becomes shortened. Having<br>answered calls of nature or having walked over a road, one should wash<br>one's feet. One should also wash one's feet before sitting to recite the<br>Vedas or to eat any food. These are the three things which are regarded<br>as pure and sacred by the deities and as such fit for the Brahmana's use,<br>viz., that whose impurity is unknown, that which has been washed in<br>water, and that which has been well-spoken of. Samyava, Krisara, meat,<br>Sashakuli and Payasa should never be cooked for one's own self. Whenever<br>cooked, these should be offered to the deities.[463] One should attend<br>every day to one's fire. One should every day give alms. One should,<br>restraining speech the while, clean one's teeth with the tooth-stick. One<br>should never be in bed when the sun is up. If one fails any day to be up<br>with the sun, one should then perform an expiation. Rising from bed, one<br>should first salute one's parents, and preceptors, or other seniors<br>deserving of respect. By so doing one attains to long life. The<br>tooth-stick should be cast off when done with, and a new one should be<br>used every day. One should eat only such food as is not forbidden in the<br>scriptures, abstaining from food of every kind on days of the new moon<br>and the full moon. One should, with senses restrained, answer calls of<br>nature, facing the north. One should not worship the deities without<br>having first washed one's teeth, Without also worshipping the deities<br>first, one should never repair to any person save one's preceptor or one<br>that is old in years or one that is righteous or one that is possessed of<br>wisdom. They that are wise should never see themselves in an unpolished<br>or dirty mirror. One should never have sexual congress with a woman that<br>is unknown or with one that is quick with child. One should never sleep<br>with head turned towards the north or the west. One should not lie down<br>upon a bed-stead that is broken or rickety. One should not sleep on a bed<br>without having examined it first with the aid of a light. Nor should one<br>sleep on a bed with another (such as wife) by one's side. One should<br>never sleep in a transverse direction. One should never make a compact<br>with atheists or do anything in conjunction with them.[464] One should<br>never drag a seat with the foot and sit on it. One should never bathe in<br>a state of nudity, nor at night. One possessed of intelligence should<br>never suffer one's limbs to be rubbed or pressed after bathing. One<br>should never smear unguents upon one's body without having first taken<br>bath. Having bathed, one should never wave one's cloth in the air (for<br>drying it). One should not always wear wet clothes. One should never take<br>off one's body the garlands of flowers one may wear. Nor should one wear<br>such garlands over one's outer garments. One should never even talk with<br>a woman during the period of her functional change. One should not answer<br>a call of nature on a field (where crops are grown) or at a place too<br>near an inhabited village. One should never answer a call of nature on a<br>water. One should first wash one's mouth thrice with water before eating<br>any food. Having finished one's meals, one should wash one's mouth thrice<br>with water and twice again. One should eat, with face turned eastwards,<br>one's food, restraining speech the while and without censuring the food<br>that is eaten. One should always leave a remnant of the food that is<br>placed before one for eating. Having finished one's meals, one should<br>mentally touch fire. If one eats with face turned eastwards, one becomes<br>endued with longevity. By eating with face turned southwards, one<br>acquires great fame. By eating with face turned westwards, one acquires<br>great wealth. By eating with face turned northwards, one becomes truthful<br>in speech. Having finished one's meals one should wash all the upper<br>holes of one's body with water.[465] Similarly, all the limbs, the navel,<br>and the palms of the hands should be washed with water. One should never<br>seat oneself upon husk of corn, or upon hair, or upon ashes, or upon<br>bones. One should, on no account, use the water that has been used by<br>another for bathing. One should always perform the Homa for propitiating<br>the deities, and recite the Savitri Mantra. One should always eat in a<br>seated posture. One should never eat while walking. One should never<br>answer a call of nature in a standing posture. One should never answer a<br>call of nature on ashes or in a cow-pen. One should wash one's feet<br>before sitting to one's meals. One should never sit or lie down for sleep<br>with wet feet. One who sits to one's meals after having washed one's<br>feet, lives for a hundred years. One should never touch these three<br>things of great energy, while one is in an impure state, viz., fire, a<br>cow, and a Brahmana. By observing this rule, one acquires longevity. One<br>should not, while one is in an impure state, cast one's eyes on these<br>three things of great energy, viz., the sun, the moon, and the stars. The<br>life-breaths of a young man go upwards when an old and venerable person<br>comes to his abode. He gets them back by standing up and properly<br>saluting the guest. Old men should always be saluted. One should, upon<br>seeing them, offer seats with one's own hand. After the old man has taken<br>his seat, one should seat oneself and remain with hands joined in<br>reverence. When an old man goes along the road, one should always follow<br>him instead of walking ahead. One should never sit on a torn or broken<br>seat. One should, without using it any longer, cast away a broken vessel<br>of white brass. One should never eat without a piece of upper garment<br>wrapping one's body. One should never bathe in a state of nudity. One<br>should never sleep in a state of nudity. One should never even touch the<br>remnants of other people's dishes and plates. One should never, while one<br>is in an impure state, touch another's head, for it is said in the<br>scriptures that the life-breaths are all concentrated in the head. One<br>should never strike another on the head or seize another by the hair. One<br>should not join one's hands together for scratching one's head. One<br>should not, while bathing, repeatedly dip one's head in water. By so<br>doing one shortens one's life. One who has bathed by dipping the head in<br>water should not, afterwards, apply oil to any part of one's body. One<br>should never take a meal without eating some sesame. One should never<br>teach (the Vedas or any scriptures) at a time when one is impure. Nor<br>should one study while one is impure. When a storm rises or a bad odour<br>permeates in the atmosphere, one should never think of the Vedas. Persons<br>conversant with ancient history recite a Gatha sung by Yama in days of<br>old. He that runs while impure or studies the Vedas under similar<br>circumstances, indeed, that regenerate Brahman who studies the Vedas at<br>forbidden times, loses his Vedas and shortens his life. Hence, one should<br>never study the Vedas with concentrated attention at forbidden times.<br>They who answer a call of nature, with face towards the sun, or towards a<br>blazing fire, or towards a cow, or towards a regenerate person, or on the<br>road, become shortlived. At daytime both calls of nature should be<br>answered with face turned towards the north. At night, those calls should<br>be answered facing the south. By so doing one does not shorten one's<br>life. One that wishes to live long should never disregard or insult any<br>of these three, however weak or emaciated they may appear to be, viz.,<br>the Brahmana, the Kshatriya, and the snake. All three are endued with<br>virulent poison. The snake, if angry, burns the victim with only a glance<br>of its eyes. The Kshatriya also, if angry, burns the objects of his<br>wrath, as soon as he sees him, with his energy. The Brahmana, stronger<br>than any of these two, destroys not only the objects of his wrath but his<br>whole race as well, not by vision alone but by thought also.[466] The man<br>of wisdom should, therefore, tend these three with care. One should,<br>never engage in any disputation with one's preceptor. O Yudhishthira, if<br>the preceptor becomes angry, he should always be pacified by due honours<br>being paid to him. Even if the preceptor happens to be entirely wrong,<br>one should still follow and honour him. Without doubt, calumnious sayings<br>against the preceptor always consume the lives of those that utter them.<br>One should always answer a call of nature at a spot far removed from<br>one's habitation. One should wash one's feet at a distance from one's<br>habitation. One should always throw the remnants of one's dishes and<br>plates at a spot far removed from one's habitation. Verily, he who<br>desires his own good should do all these. One should not wear garlands of<br>red flowers. Indeed, they who are possessed of wisdom should wear<br>garlands of flowers that are white in hue. Rejecting the lotus and the<br>lily, O thou of great might, one may bear on one's head, however, a<br>flower that is red, even if it be an aquatic one.[467] A garland of gold<br>can under no circumstances become impure. After one has bathed, O king,<br>one should use perfumes mixed with water.[468] One should never wear<br>one's upper garment for covering the lower limbs or the lower garments<br>for covering the upper ones. Nor should one wear clothes worn by another.<br>One should not, again, wear a piece of cloth that has not its lateral<br>fringes.[469] When one goes to bed, O king, one should wear a different<br>piece of cloth. When making a journey also on a road, one should wear a<br>different piece of cloth. So also, when worshipping the deities, one<br>should wear a different piece of cloth.[470] The man of intelligence<br>should smear his limbs with unguents made of Priyangu, sandalwood, Vilwa,<br>Tagara, and Kesara.[471] In observing a fast, one should purify oneself<br>by a bath, and adorn one's person with ornaments and unguents. One should<br>always abstain from sexual congress on days of the full moon and the new<br>moon. One should never, O monarch, eat off the same plate with another<br>even if that other happens to be of one's own or equal rank. Nor should<br>one ever eat any food that has been prepared by a woman in her functional<br>period. One should never eat any food or drink, any liquid whose essence<br>has been taken off. Nor should one eat anything without giving a portion<br>thereof to persons that wishfully gaze at the food that one happens to<br>take. The man of intelligence should never sit close to one that is<br>impure. Nor should one sit close to persons that are foremost in<br>piety.[472] All food that is forbidden in ritual acts should never be<br>taken even on other occasions. The fruits of the Ficus religiosa and the<br>Ficus Bengalensis as also the leaves of the Crotolaria Juncea, and the<br>fruits of the Ficus glomerata, should never be eaten by one who is<br>desirous of his own good. The flesh of goats, of kine, and the peacock,<br>should never be eaten. One should also abstain from dried flesh and all<br>flesh that is stale. The man of intelligence should never eat any salt,<br>taking it up with his hand. Nor should he eat curds and flour of fried<br>barley at night. One should abstain also from flesh of animals not slain<br>in sacrifices. One should, with concentrated attention, eat once on the<br>morning and once in the evening, abstaining entirely from all food,<br>during the interval. One should never eat any food in which one may<br>detect a hair. Nor should one eat at the Sraddha of an enemy. One should<br>eat silently; one should never eat without covering one's person with an<br>upper garment, and without sitting down.[473] One should never eat any<br>food placing it on the bare ground. One should never eat except in a<br>sitting posture. One should never make any noise while eating.[474] The<br>man of intelligence should first offer water and then food to one that<br>has become his guest, and after having served the guest thus, should then<br>sit to his meals himself. He who sits down to dinner in a line with<br>friends and himself eats any food without giving thereof to his friends,<br>is said to eat virulent poison. As regards water and Payasa and flour of<br>fried barley and curds and ghee and honey, one should never, after<br>drinking or eating these, offer the remnants thereof to others. One<br>should never, O chief of men, eat any food doubtingly.[475] One desirous<br>of food should never drink curds at the conclusion of a meal. After the<br>meal is finished, one should wash one's mouth and face with the (right)<br>hand only, and taking a little water should then dip the toe of the right<br>foot in it. After washing, one should touch the crown of one's head with<br>the (right) hand. With concentrated attention, one should next touch<br>fire. The man who knows how to observe all these ordinances with care,<br>succeeds in attaining to the foremost place among his kinsmen. One<br>should, after finishing one's meals, with one's nose and eyes and ears<br>and navel and both hands wash with water. One should not, however, keep<br>one's hands wet. Between the tip and the root of the thumb is situate the<br>sacred Tirtha known by the name of Brahma. On the back of the little<br>finger, it is said, is situate the Deva-tirtha. The intervening space<br>between the thumb and the forefinger, O Bharata, should be used for<br>discharging the Pitri rites, after touching water according to the<br>ordinance.[476] One should never indulge in other people's calumny. Nor<br>should one ever utter anything that is disagreeable. The man that desires<br>his own good should never seek to provoke against himself the wrath of<br>others. One should never seek to converse with a person that has fallen<br>away from his order. The very sight of such a person should be avoided.<br>One should never come in contact with a fallen person. By avoiding such<br>contact one succeeds in attaining to a long life. One should never<br>indulge in sexual congress at day-time. Nor should one have congress with<br>a maiden, nor with a harlot nor with a barren woman. One should never<br>have congress with a woman that has not bathed after the expiry of her<br>functional period. By avoiding such acts one succeeds in attaining to a<br>long life. After washing the several limbs directed, in view of religious<br>acts, one should wash one's lips thrice, and once more twice. By doing<br>this, one becomes purified and fit for religious acts. The several organs<br>of sense should each be washed once, and water should also be sprinkled<br>over the whole body. Having done this, one should go through the worship<br>of the Pitris and the deities, agreeably with the ordinances of the<br>Vedas. Listen to me, O thou of Kuru's race, as I tell thee what<br>purification is cleansing and beneficial for a Brahmana. Before beginning<br>to eat and after finishing the meal, and in all acts requiring<br>purification, the Brahmana should perform the achamana with water placed<br>on the limb called the Brahmatirtha.[477] After ejecting any matter from<br>the throat or spitting, one should wash one's mouth before one can become<br>pure. A kinsman who happens to be old, or a friend who happens to be<br>poor, should be established in one's house and his comforts looked after<br>as if he were a member of the family. By doing this, one succeeds in<br>acquiring both fame and long life. The establishment of pigeons in one's<br>house is fraught with blessedness, as also of parrots both male and<br>female. If female these taken to one's abode, they succeed in dispelling<br>calamity. The same is the case with cockroaches, If fireflies and<br>vultures and wood-pigeons and bees enter a house or seek residence in it,<br>acts of propitiating the deities should be performed. These are creatures<br>of evil omen, as also ospreys. One should never divulge the secrets of<br>high-souled men; one should never have sexual congress with a forbidden<br>woman. Nor should one ever have such congress with the spouse of a king<br>or with women that are the friends of queens. One should never cultivate<br>intimacy with physicians, or with children, or with persons that are old,<br>or with one's servants, O Yudhishthira. One should always provide for<br>friends, for Brahmanas, and for such as seek one's protection. By doing<br>this, O king, one acquires a long life. The man of wisdom should reside<br>in such a house as has been constructed with the aid of a Brahmana and an<br>engineer skilled in his profession, if indeed, O king, he desires his own<br>good.[478] One should not, O king, sleep at the evening twilight. Nor<br>should one study at such an hour for acquiring any branch of knowledge.<br>The man of intelligence should never eat also at such an hour. By acting<br>in this way one acquires a long life. One should never perform any act in<br>honour of the Pitris at night time. One should not deck one's person<br>after finishing one's meals. One should bathe at night, if one desires<br>one's own advancement. One should also, O Bharata, always abstain from<br>the flour of fried barley at night. The remnants of food and drink, as<br>also the flowers with which one has worshipped the deities, should never<br>be used. Inviting a guest at night, one should never, with excessive<br>courtesy, force him to eat to the point of gratification. Nor should one<br>eat oneself to the point of gratification, at night. One should not slay<br>a bird (for eating it), especially after having fed it.[479] One<br>possessed of wisdom should wed a maiden born in a high family, endued<br>with auspicious indications, and of full age. Begetting children upon her<br>and thus perpetuating one's race by that means, one should make over<br>one's sons to a good preceptor for acquiring general knowledge, O<br>Bharata, as also a knowledge of the especial customs of the family, O<br>monarch. The daughters that one may beget should be bestowed upon youths<br>of respectable families, that are again possessed of intelligence. Sons<br>should also be established and a portion of the family inheritance, given<br>to them, O Bharata, as their provision. One should bathe by dipping one's<br>head in water before one sits down to perform any act in honour of the<br>Pitris of the deities. One should never perform a Sraddha under the<br>constellation of one's nativity. No Sraddha should be performed under any<br>of the Bhadrapadas (prior or later), nor under the constellation<br>Krittika, O Bharata. The Sraddha should never be performed under any of<br>those constellations that are regarded as fierce (such as Aslesha, etc )<br>and any of those that, upon calculation, seem to be hostile. Indeed, in<br>this respect, all these constellations should be avoided which are<br>forbidden in treatises on astrology. One should sit facing either the<br>east or the north while undergoing a shave at the hands of the barber. By<br>so doing, O great king, one succeeds in acquiring a long life. One should<br>never indulge in other people's calumny or self-reproach, for, O chief of<br>the Bharatas, it is said that calumny is sinful, whether of others or of<br>oneself. In wedding, one should avoid a woman that is deficient of any<br>limb. A maiden too, if such, should also be avoided. A woman of the same<br>Pravaras should also be avoided; as also one that has any malformation;<br>as also one that has been born in the race to which one's mother<br>belongs.[480] One possessed of wisdom should never have sexual congress<br>with a woman that is old, or one that has abandoned the domestic mode of<br>life for entering the forest mode, or one that is true to her lord, or<br>one whose organs of generation are not healthy or well-formed.[481] It<br>behoveth thee not to wed a woman that is of a yellow complexion, or one<br>that is afflicted with leprosy, or one born in a family in which there<br>has been epilepsy, or one that is low in birth and habits, or one that is<br>born in a family in which the disease called Switra (leprosy) has<br>appeared, or one belonging by birth to a race in which there are early<br>deaths. Only that maiden who is endued with auspicious indications, and<br>who is accomplished for qualifications of diverse kinds, who is agreeable<br>and handsome, should be wedded. One should wed, O Yudhishthira, in a<br>family that is higher or at least equal to one's own. One who is desirous<br>of one's own prosperity, should never wed a woman that is of an inferior<br>order or that has fallen away from the order of her birth. Carefully<br>igniting the fire, one should accomplish all those acts which have been<br>ordained and declared in the Vedas or by the Brahmanas.[482] One should<br>never seek to injure women. Spouses should always be protected. Malice<br>always shortens life. Hence, one should always abstain from cherishing<br>malice. Sleep at day-time shortens life. To sleep after the sun has risen<br>shortens life. They who sleep at any of the twilights, or at nightfall or<br>who go to sleep in a state of impurity, have their lives shortened.<br>Adultery always shortens life. One should not remain in a state of<br>impurity after shaving.[483] One should, O Bharata, carefully abstain<br>from studying or reciting the Vedas, and eating, and bathing, at<br>eventide. When the evening twilight comes, one should collect one's<br>senses for meditation, without doing any act. One should, O king, bathe<br>and then worship the Brahmanas. Indeed, one should bathe before<br>worshipping the deities and reverentially saluting the preceptor. One<br>should never go to a sacrifice unless invited. Indeed, one may go there<br>without an invitation if one wishes only to see how the sacrifice is<br>conducted. If one goes to a sacrifice (for any other purpose) without an<br>invitation and if one does not, on that account, receive proper worship<br>from the sacrificer, one's life becomes shortened. One should never go<br>alone on a journey to foreign parts. Nor should one ever proceed alone to<br>any place at night. Before evening comes, one should come back to one's<br>house and remain within it. One should always obey the commands of one's<br>mother and father and preceptor, without at all judging whether those<br>commands are beneficial or otherwise. One should, O king, attend with<br>great care to the Vedas and the science of arms. Do then, O king,<br>carefully attend to the practice of riding an elephant, a steed, and a<br>war-chariot. The man who attends to these with care succeeds in attaining<br>to happiness. Such a king succeeds in becoming unconquerable by foes, and<br>sway his servants and kinsmen without any of them being able to get the<br>better of him. The king that attains to such a position and that<br>carefully attends to the duty of protecting his subjects, has never to<br>incur any loss. Thou shouldst acquire, O king, the science of reasoning,<br>as also the science of words, the science of the Gandharvas, and the four<br>and sixty branches of knowledge known by the name of Kala. One should<br>every day hear the Puranas and the Itihasas and all the other narratives<br>that exist, as also the life-stories of all high-souled personages. When<br>one's spouse passes through functional period, one should never have<br>congress with her, nor even summon her for conversation. The man endued<br>with wisdom may accept her companionship on the fourth day after the bath<br>of purification. If one indulges in congress on the fifth day from the<br>first appearance of the functional operation, one gets a daughter. By<br>indulging in congress on the sixth day, one happens to have a son. The<br>man of wisdom should in the matter of congress, attend to this rule<br>(about odd and even days). Kinsmen and relatives by marriage and friends<br>should all be treated with respect. One should, according to the best of<br>one's power, adore the deities in sacrifices, giving away diverse kinds<br>of articles as sacrificial Dakshina. After the period ordained for the<br>domestic mode of life has been passed, one should, O king, enter the life<br>of a forest recluse. I have thus told thee all the indications, in brief,<br>of persons who succeed in living long.[484] What remains untold by me<br>should be heard by thee from the mouths of persons well-versed in the<br>three Vedas, O Yudhishthira. Thou shouldst know that conduct is the root<br>of prosperity. Conduct is the enhancer of fame. It is conduct that<br>prolongs life. It is conduct that destroys all calamities and evils.<br>Conduct has been said to be superior to all the branches of knowledge. It<br>is conduct that begets righteousness, and it is righteousness that<br>prolongs life. Conduct is productive of fame, of long life, and of<br>heaven. Conduct is the most efficacious rite of propitiating the deities<br>(for bringing about auspiciousness of every kind). The Self-born Brahman<br>himself has said that one should show compassion unto all orders of<br>men.'"[485]
