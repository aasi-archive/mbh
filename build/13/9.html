                            "Yudhisthira said, 'O grandsire, O thou of great splendour, what do those<br>men become who, through stupefaction of intellect, do not make gifts unto<br>Brahmanas after having promised to make those gifts? O thou that art the<br>foremost of all righteous persons, do tell me what the duties are in this<br>respect. Indeed, what becomes the end of those wicked wights that do not<br>give after having promised to give.'"<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The person that, after having promised, does not give, be<br>it little or much, has the mortification to see his hopes (in every<br>direction) become fruitless like the hopes of a eunuch in respect of<br>progeny. Whatever good acts such a person does between the day of his<br>birth and that of his death, O Bharata, whatever libations he pours on<br>the sacrificial fire, whatever gifts he makes, O chief of Bharata's race,<br>and whatever penances he performs all become fruitless. They that are<br>conversant with the scriptures declare this as their opinion, arriving at<br>it, O chief of the Bharatas, with the aid of a well-ordered<br>understanding. Persons conversant with the scriptures are also of opinion<br>that such a man may be cleansed by giving away a thousand horses with<br>ears of a dark hue. In this connection is cited the old narrative of the<br>discourse between a jackal and an ape. While both were human beings, O<br>scorcher of foes, they were intimate friends. After death one of them<br>became a jackal and the other an ape. Beholding the jackal one day eating<br>an animal carcase in the midst of a crematorium, the ape, remembering his<br>own and his friend's former birth as human beings, addressed him,<br>saying,&#8212;Verily, what terrible sin didst thou perpetrate in thy former<br>birth in consequence of which thou art obliged in this birth to feed in a<br>crematorium upon such repulsive fare as the putrid carcase of an<br>animal?&#8212;Thus addressed, the jackal replied unto the ape, saying,&#8212;Having<br>promised to give unto a Brahmana I did not make him the gift. It is for<br>that sin, O ape, that I have fallen into this wretched order of<br>existence. It is for that reason that, when hungry, I am obliged to eat<br>such food.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The jackal then, O best of men, addressed the ape<br>and said,&#8212;What sin didst thou commit for which thou hast become an ape?'<br><br>"The ape said, 'In my former life I used to appropriate the fruits<br>belonging to Brahmanas. Hence have I become an ape. Hence it is clear<br>that one possessed of intelligence and learning should never appropriate<br>what belongs to Brahmanas. Verily, as one should abstain from this, one<br>should avoid also all disputes with Brahmanas. Having promised, one<br>should certainly make the promised gift unto them.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'I heard this, O king, from my preceptor while he was<br>engaged in discoursing upon the subject of Brahmanas. I heard this from<br>that righteous person when he recited the old and sacred declaration on<br>this topic. I heard this from Krishna also, O king, while he was engaged<br>in discoursing, O son of Pandu, upon Brahmanas.[14] The property of a<br>Brahmana should never be appropriated. They should always be let alone.<br>Poor, or miserly, or young in years, they should never be disregarded.<br>The Brahmanas have always taught me this. Having promised to make them a<br>gift, the gift should be made. A superior Brahmana should never be<br>disappointed in the matter of his expectations. A Brahmana, O king, in<br>whom an expectation has been raised, has, O king, been said to be like a<br>blazing fire.[15] That man upon whom a Brahmana with raised expectations<br>casts his eye, is sure, O monarch, to be consumed even as a heap of straw<br>is capable of being consumed by a blazing fire.[16] When the Brahmana,<br>gratified (with honours and gifts) by the king addresses the king in<br>delightful and affectionate words, he becomes, O Bharata, a source of<br>great benefit to the king, for he continues to live in the kingdom like a<br>physician combating against diverse ills of the body.[17] Such a Brahmana<br>is sure to maintain by his puissance and good wishes, the sons and<br>grandsons and animals and relatives and ministers and other officers and<br>the city and the provinces of the king.[18] Even such is the energy, so<br>great, of the Brahmana like unto that of the thousand-rayed Surya<br>himself, on the Earth. There-fore, O Yudhishthira, if one wishes to<br>attain to a respectable or happy order of being in one's next birth, one<br>should, having passed the promise to a Brahmana, certainly keep it by<br>actually making the gift to him. By making gifts to a Brahmana one is<br>sure to attain to the highest heaven. Verily, the making of gifts is the<br>highest of acts that one can achieve. By the gifts one makes to a<br>Brahmana, the deities and the pitris are supported. Hence one possessed<br>of knowledge should ever make gifts unto the Brahmanas. O chief of the<br>Bharatas, the Brahmana is regarded as the highest object unto whom gifts<br>should be made. At no time should a Brahmana be received without being<br>properly worshipped."
