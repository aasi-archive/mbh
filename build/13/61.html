                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I wish to know in detail, O Bharata, where one meets<br>with the high rewards of gifts and sacrifices. Are those rewards earned<br>here or are they to come hereafter? Which amongst these two (viz., Gift<br>and Sacrifice) is said to be productive of superior merit? Unto whom<br>should gifts be made? In what manner are gifts and sacrifices to be made?<br>When also are they to be made? I ask thee all these. O learned sire! Do<br>thou discourse to me on the duty of gifts! Do tell me, O grandsire, what<br>leads to the highest reward, viz., gifts made from the sacrificial<br>platform or those made out of that place?[324]<br><br>'Bhishma said, 'O son, a Kshatriya is generally employed in deeds of<br>fierceness. In his case, sacrifices and gifts are regarded as cleansing<br>or sanctifying him. They, that are good and righteous, do not accept the<br>gifts of persons of the royal order, who are given to sinful acts. For<br>this reason, the king should perform sacrifices with abundant gifts in<br>the form of Dakshina.[325] If the good and righteous would accept the<br>gifts made unto them, the Kshatriya, O monarch, should incessantly make<br>gifts with devotion and faith unto them. Gifts are productive of great<br>merit, and are highly cleansing. Observant of vows, one should perform<br>sacrifices and gratify with wealth such Brahmanas as are friends of all<br>creatures, possessed of righteousness, conversant with the Vedas, and<br>preeminent for acts, conduct, and penances. If such Brahmanas do not<br>accept thy gifts, no merit becomes thine. Do thou perform sacrifices with<br>copious Dakshina, and make gifts of good and agreeable food unto those<br>that are righteous. By making an act of gift thou shouldst regard thyself<br>as performing a sacrifice. Thou shouldst with gifts adore those Brahmanas<br>who perform sacrifices. By doing this thou will acquire a share in the<br>merits of those sacrifices of theirs. Thou shouldst support such<br>Brahmanas as are possessed of children and as are capable of sending<br>people to Heaven. By conducting thyself in this way thou art sure to get<br>a large progeny&#8212;in fact as large a progeny as the Prajapati himself.<br>They that are righteous support and advance the cause of all righteous<br>acts. One should, by giving up one's all, support such men, as also those<br>that do good unto all creatures. Thyself being in the enjoyment of<br>affluence, do thou, O Yudhishthira, make unto Brahmanas gifts of kine and<br>bullocks and food and umbrellas, and robes and sandals or shoes Do thou<br>give unto sacrificing Brahmanas clarified butter, as also food and cars<br>and vehicles with horses harnessed thereto, and dwelling houses and<br>mansions and beds. Such gifts are fraught with prosperity and affluence<br>to the giver, and are regarded as pure, O Bharata. Those Brahmanas that<br>are not censurable for anything they do, and that have no means of<br>support assigned to them, should be searched out. Covertly or publicly do<br>thou cherish such Brahmanas by assigning them the means of support. Such<br>conduct always confers higher benefit upon Kshatriyas than the Rajasuya<br>and the Horse-sacrifices. Cleansing thyself of sin, thou art sure of<br>attaining to Heaven. Filling thy treasury thou shouldst do good to thy<br>kingdom. By such conduct thou art sure to win much wealth and become a<br>Brahmana (in thy next life). Do thou, O Bharata, protect thy own means<br>(of support and of doing acts of righteousness), as also the means of<br>other people's subsistence. Do thou support thy servants as thy own<br>children. Do thou, O Bharata, protect the Brahmanas in the enjoyment of<br>what they have and make gifts unto them of such articles as they have<br>not. Let thy life be devoted to the purpose of the Brahmanas. Let it<br>never be said that thou dost not grant protection to the Brahmanas. Much<br>wealth or affluence, when possessed by a Brahmana, becomes a source of<br>evil to him. Constant association with affluence and prosperity is<br>certain to fill him with pride and cause him to be stupefied (in respect<br>of his true duties). If the Brahmanas become stupefied and steeped in<br>folly, righteousness and duties are sure to suffer destruction. Without<br>doubt, if righteousness and duty come to an end, it will lead to the<br>destruction of all creatures. That king who having amassed wealth makes<br>it over (for safe keep) to his treasury officers and guards, and then<br>commences again to plunder his kingdom, saying unto his officers, 'Do ye<br>bring me as much wealth as you can extort from the kingdom,' and who<br>spends the wealth that is thus collected at his command under<br>circumstances of fear and cruelty, in the performance of sacrifices,<br>should know that those sacrifices of his are never applauded by the<br>righteous. The king should perform sacrifices with such wealth as is<br>willingly paid into his treasury by prosperous and unpersecuted subjects.<br>Sacrifices should never be performed with wealth acquired by severity and<br>extortion. The king should then perform great sacrifices with large<br>presents in the shape of Dakshina, when in consequence of his being<br>devoted to the good of his subjects, the latter bathe him with copious<br>showers of wealth brought willingly by them for the purpose. The king<br>should protect the wealth of those that are old, of those that are<br>minors, of those that are blind, and of those that are otherwise<br>disqualified. The king should never take any wealth from his people, if<br>they, in a season of drought, succeed in growing any corn with the aid of<br>water obtained from wells. Nor should he take any wealth from weeping<br>women.[326] The wealth taken from the poor and the helpless is sure to<br>destroy the kingdom and the prosperity of the king. The king should<br>always make unto the righteous gifts of all enjoyable articles in<br>abundance. He should certainly dispel the fear of famishing which those<br>men may have.[327] There are no men more sinful than those upon whose<br>food children look with wistfulness without being able to eat them duly.<br>If within thy kingdom any learned Brahmana languishes with hunger like<br>any of those children, thou shalt then incur the sin of foeticide for<br>having allowed such an act. King Sivi himself had said this, viz., 'Fie<br>on that king in whose kingdom a Brahmana or even any other man languishes<br>from hunger.' That kingdom in which a Brahmana of the Snataka class<br>languishes with hunger becomes overwhelmed with adversity. Such a kingdom<br>with its king also incurs reproach. That king is more dead than alive in<br>whose kingdom women are easily abducted from the midst of husbands and<br>sons, uttering cries and groans of indignation and grief The subjects<br>should arm themselves to slay that King who does not protect them, who<br>simply plunders their wealth, who confounds all distinctions, who is ever<br>incapable of taking their lead, who is without compassion, and who is<br>regarded as the most sinful of kings. That king who tells his people that<br>he is their protector but who does not or is unable to protect them,<br>should be slain by his combined subjects, like a dog that is affected<br>with the rabies and has become mad. A fourth part of whatever sins are<br>committed by the subjects clings to that king who does not protect, O<br>Bharata. Some authorities say that the whole of those sins is taken by<br>such a king. Others are of opinion that a half thereof becomes his.<br>Bearing in mind, however, the declaration of Manu, it is our opinion that<br>a fourth part of such sins becomes the unprotecting king's. That king, O<br>Bharata, who grants protection to his subjects obtains a fourth part of<br>whatever merits his subjects acquire living under his protection. Do<br>thou, O Yudhishthira, act in such a way that all thy subjects may seek<br>thee as their refuge as long as thou art alive, even as all creatures<br>seek the refuge of the deity of rain or even as the winged denizens of<br>the air seek the refuge of a large tree. Let all thy kinsmen and all thy<br>friends and well-wishers, O scorcher of foes, seek thee as their refuge<br>even as the Rakshasas seek Kuvera or the deities seek Indra as theirs.'"
