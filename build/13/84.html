                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast, O grandsire, discoursed to me on the gift<br>of kine that is fraught with great merit. In the case of kings observant<br>of their duties, that gift is most meritorious. Sovereignty is always<br>painful. It is incapable of being borne by persons of uncleansed souls.<br>In the generality of cases, kings fail to attain to auspicious ends. By<br>always making, however, gifts of earth, they succeed in cleansing<br>themselves (of all their sins). Thou hast, O prince of Kuru's race,<br>discoursed to me on many duties. Thou hast discoursed to me on the gifts<br>of kine made by king Nriga in days of old. The Rishi Nachiketa, in<br>ancient times, had discoursed on the merits of this act. The Vedas and<br>the Upanishads also have laid down that in all sacrifices,&#8212;in fact, in<br>all kinds of religious acts,&#8212;the Dakshina should be earth or kine or<br>gold. The Srutis, however, declare that in all Dakshinas, gold is<br>superior and is, indeed, the best. I desire, O grandsire, to hear thee<br>discourse truly on this topic. What is gold? How did it spring up? When<br>did it come into existence? What is its essence? Who is its presiding<br>deity? What are its fruits? Why is it regarded as the foremost of all<br>things? For what reason do men of wisdom applaud the gift of gold? For<br>what reason is gold regarded as the best Dakshinas in all sacrifices? Why<br>also is gold regarded as a cleanser superior to earth itself and kine?<br>Why, indeed, is it regarded so superior as a Dakshina? Do thou, O<br>grandsire, discourse to me on all this!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, Listen, O king, with concentrated attention to me as I<br>recite to thee in detail the circumstances connected with the origin of<br>gold as understood by me. When my father Santanu of great energy departed<br>from this world, I proceeded to Gangadwara for performing his Sraddha.<br>Arrived there, I commenced the Sraddha of my father. My mother Jahnavi,<br>coming there, rendered me great help. Inviting many ascetics crowned with<br>success and causing them to take their seats before me, I commenced the<br>preliminary rites consisting of gifts of water and of other things.<br>Having with a concentrated mind performed all preliminary rites as laid<br>down in the scriptures, I set myself to duly offer the obsequial cake. I<br>then saw, O king, that a handsome arm, adorned with Angadas and other<br>ornaments, rose up, piercing the ground, through the blades of Kusa grass<br>which I had spread. Beholding that arm rise from the ground, I became<br>filled with wonder. Indeed, O chief of Bharata's race, I thought that my<br>father had come himself for accepting the cake I was about to offer.<br>Reflecting then, by the light of the scriptures, the conviction soon came<br>upon me that the ordinance does occur in the Vedas that the cake should<br>not be presented into the hand of him whose Sraddha is performed. Even<br>this was the conviction that took possession of my mind, viz., that the<br>obsequial cake should never be presented in this world by a man into the<br>visible hand of the man whose obsequial rites are performed. The Pitris<br>do not come in their visible forms for taking the cake. On the other<br>hand, the ordinance provides that it should be presented on the blades of<br>Kusa grass spread on the earth for the purpose. I then, disregarding that<br>hand which constituted an indication of my father's presence, and<br>recollecting the true ordinance depending upon the authority of the<br>scriptures respecting the mode of presenting the cake, offered the entire<br>cake, O chief of the Bharatas, upon those blades of Kusa grass that were<br>spread before me. Know, O prince of men, that what I did was perfectly<br>consistent with the scriptural ordinance. After this, the arm of my sire,<br>O monarch, vanished in our very sight. On that night as I slept, the<br>Pitris appeared to me in a dream. Gratified with me they said, O chief of<br>Bharata's race, even these words, 'We have been pleased with thee, for<br>the indication thou hast afforded today of thy adherence to the<br>ordinance. It has pleased us to see that thou hast not swerved from the<br>injunctions of the scriptures. The scriptural ordinance, having been<br>followed by thee, has become more authoritative, O king. By such conduct<br>thou hast honoured and maintained the authority of thyself, the<br>scriptures, the auditions of the Vedas, the Pitris and the Rishis, the<br>Grandsire Brahman himself, and those seniors, viz., the Prajapatis.<br>Adherence to the scriptures has been maintained. Thou hast today, O chief<br>of the Bharatas, acted very properly. Thou hast made gifts of earth and<br>kine. Do thou make gifts of gold. The gifts of gold is very cleansing. O<br>thou that art well-conversant with duties, know that by such acts of<br>thine, both ourselves and our forefathers will all be cleansed of all our<br>sins. Such gifts rescue both ancestors and descendants to the tenth<br>degree of the person who makes them.' Even these were the words that my<br>ancestors, appearing unto me in a dream, said unto me, I then awoke, O<br>king, and became filled with wonder. Indeed, O chief of Bharata's race, I<br>set my heart then upon making gifts of gold. Listen now, monarch, to this<br>old history. It is highly praiseworthy and it extends the period of his<br>life who listens to it. It was first recited to Rama, the son of<br>Jamadagni In former days Jamadagni's son Rama, filled with great wrath,<br>exterminated the Kshatriyas from off the face of the earth for thrice<br>seven times. Having subjugated the entire earth the heroic Rama of eyes<br>like lotus-petals began to make preparations for performing a<br>Horse-sacrifice, O king, that is praised by all Brahmanas and Kshatriyas<br>and that is capable of granting the fruition of every wish. That<br>sacrifice cleanses all creatures and enhances the energy and splendour of<br>those who succeed in performing it. Endued with great energy, Rama, by<br>the performance of that sacrifice became purified. Having, however,<br>performed that foremost of sacrifices, the high-souled Rama failed yet to<br>attain to perfect lightness of heart. Repairing unto Rishis conversant<br>with every branch of learning as also the deities, Rama of Bhrigu's race<br>questioned them. Filled with repentance and compassion, he addressed<br>them, saying, 'Ye highly blessed ones, do ye declare that which is more<br>cleansing still for men engaged in fierce deeds.' Thus addressed by him,<br>those great Rishis, fully acquainted with the Vedas and the scriptures,<br>answered him, saying, 'O Rama, guided by the authority of the Vedas, do<br>thou honour all learned Brahmanas. Following this conduct for some time<br>do thou once more ask the regenerate Rishis as to what should be done by<br>thee for cleansing thyself. Follow the advice which those persons of<br>great wisdom give.' Repairing then to Vasishtha and Agastya and Kasyapa,<br>that delighter of the Bhrigus, endued with great energy, asked them that<br>question, 'Ye foremost of Brahmanas, even this is the wish that has<br>arisen in my heart. How, indeed, may I succeed in cleansing myself? By<br>what acts and rites may this be brought about? Or, if by gifts, what is<br>that article by giving away which this wish of mine may be accomplished?<br>Ye foremost or righteous persons, if your minds be inclined to do me a<br>favour, then do tell me, ye that are endued with wealth of asceticism,<br>what is that by which I may succeed in cleansing myself.'<br><br>"The Rishis said, 'O delighter of the Bhrigus, the mortal that has sinned<br>becomes cleansed by making gifts of kine, of earth, and of wealth. Even<br>this is what we have heard. There is another gift that is regarded as a<br>great cleanser. Listen to us, O regenerate Rishi, as we discourse on it.<br>That article is excellent and is endued with wonderful aspect and is,<br>besides, the offspring of Fire. In days of yore, the god Agni burnt all<br>the world. It has been heard by us that from his seed sprung gold of<br>bright complexion. It came to be celebrated under the name of good<br>complexioned. By making gifts of gold thou art sure to have thy wish<br>crowned with fruition. Then the illustrious Vasishtha in especial, of<br>rigid vows, addressing him, said, 'Hear, O Rama, how gold, which has the<br>splendour of fire sprang into existence. That gold will confer merit on<br>thee. In matters of gifts, gold is highly applauded. I shall also tell<br>thee what is gold, whence it has come, and how it has come to be invested<br>with superior attributes. Listen to me, O thou of mighty arms, as I<br>discourse upon these topics. Know this as certain that gold is of the<br>essence of Fire and Soma. The goat is Fire (for it given, it leads to the<br>region of the deity of fire); the sheep is Varuna (for if leads to the<br>region of Varuna the lord of waters); the horse is Surya (for if leads to<br>the region of Surya); elephants are Nagas (for they lead to the world of<br>Nagas); buffaloes are Asuras (for they lead to the region of Asuras);<br>cocks and boars are Rakshasas (for they lead to the regions of the<br>Rakshasas), O delighter of the Bhrigus; earth is sacrifice, kine, water,<br>and Soma (for it leads to the merits of sacrifice, and to the region of<br>kine, of the lord of waters and of Soma). Even these are the declarations<br>of the Smritis. Churning the entire universe, a mass of energy was found.<br>That energy is gold. Hence, O regenerate Rishi, compared to all these<br>objects (which I have named above) gold is certainly superior. It is a<br>precious thing, high and excellent.'[383] It is for this reason that the<br>deities and Gandharvas and Uragas and Rakshasas and human beings and<br>Pisachas hold it with care. All these beings, O son of Bhrigu's race,<br>shine in splendour, with the aid of gold, after converting it into crowns<br>and armlets and diverse kinds of ornaments. It is also for this reason<br>that gold is regarded as the most cleansing of all cleansing things such<br>as earth and kine and all other kinds of wealth, O prince of men. The<br>gift of gold, O puissant king, is the highest gift. It is distinguished<br>above the gifts of earth, of kine, and of all other things, O thou that<br>art endued with the effulgence of an immortal, gold is an eternal<br>cleanser. Do thou make gifts of it unto the foremost of Brahmanas as it<br>is the foremost of cleansing things. Of all kinds of Dakshina, gold is<br>the best. They who make gifts of gold are said to be givers of all<br>things. Indeed, they who make gifts of gold come to be regarded as givers<br>of deities. Agni is all the deities in one, and gold has Agni for its<br>essence. Hence it is that the person who makes gifts of gold gives away<br>all the deities. Hence, O chief of men, there is no gift higher than the<br>gift of gold.'<br><br>"Vasishtha continued, 'Hear once more, O regenerate Rishi, as I discourse<br>upon it, the pre-eminence of gold, O foremost of all wielders of weapons.<br>I heard this formerly in the Purana, O son of Bhrigu's race. I represent<br>the speech of Prajapati himself. After the wedding was over of the<br>illustrious and high-souled Rudra armed with the trident, O son of<br>Bhrigu's race, with the goddess who became his spouse, on the breast of<br>that foremost of mountains, viz., Himavat, the illustrious and<br>high-souled deity wished to unite himself with the goddess. Thereupon all<br>the deities, penetrated with anxiety, approached Rudra. Bending their<br>heads with reverence and gratifying Mahadeva and his boon giving spouse<br>Uma, both of whom were seated together, they addressed Rudra, O<br>perpetuator of Bhrigu's race, saying, 'This union, O illustrious and<br>sinless one, of thine with the goddess, is a union of one endued with<br>penances with another of penances as severe! Verily, it is the union, O<br>lord, of one possessed of very great energy with another whose energy is<br>scarcely less! Thou, O illustrious one, art of energy that is<br>irresistible. The goddess Uma, also is possessed of energy that is<br>equally irresistible. The offspring that will result from a union like<br>this, will, without doubt, O illustrious deity, be endued with very great<br>might. Verily, O puissant lord, that offspring will consume all things in<br>the three worlds without leaving a remnant. Do thou then, O lord of all<br>the universe, O thou of large eyes, grant unto these deities prostrated<br>before thee, a boon from desire of benefiting the three worlds! Do thou,<br>O puissant one, restrain this high energy of thine which may become the<br>seed of offspring. Verily, that energy is the essence of all forces in<br>the three worlds. Ye two, by an act of congress, are sure to scorch the<br>universe! The offspring that will be born of you two will certainly be<br>able to afflict the deities! Neither the goddess Earth, nor the<br>Firmament, nor Heaven, O puissant one, nor all of them together, will be<br>able to bear thy energy, we firmly believe. The entire universe is<br>certain to be burnt through the force of thy energy. It behoveth thee, O<br>puissant one, to show us favour, O illustrious deity. That favour<br>consists in thy not begetting a son, O foremost of the deities, upon the<br>goddess Uma. Do thou, with patience, restrain thy fiery and puissant<br>energy!' Unto the deities that said so the holy Mahadeva having the bull<br>for his sign, O regenerate Rishi, answered, saying, 'So be it!' Having<br>said so, the deity that has the bull for his vehicle, drew up his vital<br>seed. From that time he came to be called by the name, of Urdhvaretas<br>(one that has drawn up the vital seed). The spouse of Rudra, however, at<br>this endeavour of the deities to stop procreation, became highly<br>incensed. In consequence of her being of the opposite sex (and,<br>therefore, endued with little control upon her temper) she used harsh<br>words, thus, 'Since ye have opposed my lord in the matter of procreating<br>a child when he was desirous of procreating one upon me, as the<br>consequence of this act, ye deities, ye all shall become sonless. Verily,<br>since ye have opposed the birth of issue from me, therefore, ye shall<br>have no offspring of your own.' At the time this curse was denounced, O<br>perpetuator of Bhrigu's race, the deity of fire was not there. It is in<br>consequence of this curse of the goddess that the deities have become<br>childless. Rudra, solicited by them, held in himself his energy of<br>incomparable puissance. A small quantity, however, that came out of his<br>body fell down on the earth. That seed, falling on the earth, leaped into<br>a blazing fire and there began to grow (in size and power) most<br>wonderfully. The energy of Rudra, coming in contact with another energy<br>of great puissance, became identified with it in respect of essence.<br>Meanwhile, all the deities having Sakra at their head, were scorched a<br>good deal by the Asura named Taraka. The Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras,<br>the Maruts, the Aswins, and the Sadhyas all became exceedingly afflicted<br>in consequence of the prowess of that son of Diti. All the regions of the<br>deities, their beautiful cars, and their palatial mansions, and the<br>retreats of the Rishis, were snatched away by the Asuras. Then the<br>deities and the Rishis, with cheerless hearts, sought the protection of<br>the illustrious and puissant Brahman of unfading glory.'"
