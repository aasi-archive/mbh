                            "Bhishma said, "In this connection is cited the old history of the oaths<br>(taken by many Rishis one after another) on the occasion of a sojourn to<br>the sacred waters. O best of the Bharatas, the act of theft had been done<br>by Indra, and the oaths were taken by many royal and regenerate Rishis.<br>Once on a time, the Rishis, having assembled together, proceeded to the<br>western Prabhasa. They held a consultation there which resulted in a<br>resolve on their part to visit all the sacred waters on earth. There were<br>Sakra and Angiras and Kavi of great learning and Agastya and Narada and<br>Pravata; and Bhrigu and Vasishtha and Kasyapa and Gautama and Viswamitra<br>and Jamadagni, O king! There were also the Rishi Galava, and Ashtaka and<br>Bharadwaja and Arundhati and the Valakhilyas; and Sivi and Dilipa and<br>Nahusha and Amvarisha and the royal Yayati and Dhundhumara and Puru.<br>These foremost of men, placing the high-souled Satakratu, the slayer of<br>Vritra, at their head, went to all the sacred waters one after another,<br>and at last reached the highly sacred Kausiki on the day of the full moon<br>in the month of Magha. Having cleansed themselves of all sins by<br>ablutions performed in all the sacred waters, they at last proceeded to<br>the very sacred Brahmasara. Bathing in that lake, those Rishis endued<br>with energy like that of fire began to gather and eat the stalks of the<br>lotus. Amongst those Brahmanas, some had extracted the stalks of the<br>lotus and some the stalks of the Nymphoea stellata. Soon they found that<br>the stalks extracted by Agastya (and deposited on the bank) had been<br>taken away by somebody. The foremost of Rishis, Agastya, addressing them<br>all, said, 'Who has taken away the good stalks which I had extracted and<br>deposited here? I suspect some one amongst you must have done the act.<br>Let him who has taken them away give them back to me. It behoves you not<br>thus to misappropriate my stalks! It is heard that Time assails the<br>energy of Righteousness. That Time has come upon us. Hence, Righteousness<br>is afflicted. It is meet that I should go to heaven for good, before<br>unrighteousness assails the world and establishes itself here![427]<br>Before the time comes when Brahmanas, loudly uttering the fully Vedas,<br>within the precincts of villages and inhabited places, cause the Sudras<br>to hear them, before the time comes when kings often against the rules of<br>Righteousness from motives of policy, I shall go to heaven for good!<br>Before men cease to regard the distinctions between the lower, the<br>middle, and the higher classes, I shall go to heaven for good. Before<br>Ignorance assails the world and envelops all things in darkness, I shall<br>go to heaven for good.[428] Before the time comes when the strong begin<br>to lord it over the weak and treat them as slaves, I shall go to heaven<br>for good. Indeed, I dare not remain on earth for witnessing these<br>things.' The Rishis, much concerned at what he said, addressed that great<br>ascetic and said, 'We have not stolen thy stalks! Thou shouldst not<br>harbour these suspicions against us. O great Rishi, we shall take the<br>most frightful oaths!' Having said these words, conscious of their own<br>innocence, and desirous of upholding the cause of righteousness, those<br>Rishis and sages of royal descent then began to swear, one after another,<br>the following oaths.'"<br><br>"Bhrigu said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks censure when censured,<br>assail when assailed, and eat the flesh that is attached to the back-bone<br>of animals (slaughtered in sacrifice)!'"[429]<br><br>"Vasishtha said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks neglect his Vedic<br>studies, leash hounds, and having, taken himself to the mendicant order<br>live in a city or town!'[430]<br><br>"Kasyapa said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks sell all things in all<br>places, misappropriate deposits, and give false evidence!'<br><br>"Gautama said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks live, displaying pride<br>in all things, with an understanding that does not see all creatures with<br>an equal eye, and always yielding himself to the influence of desire and<br>wrath! Let him be a cultivator of the soil, and let him be inspired by<br>malice!'[431]<br><br>"Angiras said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks be always impure! Let<br>him be a censurable Brahmana (for his misdeeds). Let him leash hounds.<br>Let him be guilty of Brahmanicide. Let him be averse to expiations after<br>having committed transgressions!'"<br><br>"Dhundhumara said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks be ungrateful to<br>his friends! Let him take birth in a Sudra woman! Let him eat alone any<br>good food (coming to the house), without sharing it with others!'"[432]<br><br>"Dilipa said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks descend to those regions<br>of misery and infamy which are reserved for that Brahmana who re-sides in<br>a village having but one well and who has sexual congress with a Sudra<br>woman!'"[433]<br><br>"Puru said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks adopt the occupation of a<br>physician! Let him be supported by the earnings of his wife! Let him draw<br>his sustenance from his father-in-law!'"<br><br>"Sukra said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks eat the flesh of animals<br>not slain in sacrifices! Let him have sexual congress at day-time! Let<br>him be a servant of the king!'"<br><br>"Jamadagni said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks study the Vedas on<br>forbidden days or occasions. Let him feed friends at Sraddhas performed<br>by him! Let him eat at the Sraddha of a Sudra!'<br><br>"Sivi said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks die without having<br>established a fire (for daily worship)! Let him be guilty of obstructing<br>the performance of sacrifices by others! Let him quarrel with those that<br>are observant of penances!'"<br><br>"Yayati said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks be guilty of having<br>sexual congress with his wife when she is not in her season and when he<br>is himself in the observance of a vow and bears matted locks on his head!<br>Let him also disregard the Vedas!'"<br><br>"Nahusha said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks live in domesticity<br>after having betaken himself to the vow of mendicancy! Let him act in<br>whatever way he pleases (and without restraint of any kind), after having<br>undergone the initiatory rites in view of a sacrifice or some solemn<br>observance! Let him take pecuniary gratification for prelections to<br>disciples (on any branch of knowledge that the latter come to learn)!'<br><br>"Amvarisha said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks be cruel and<br>unrighteous in his behaviour towards women and kinsmen and kine! Let him<br>be guilty also of Brahmanicide!'"<br><br>"Narada said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks be one that identifies<br>the body with the soul! Let him study the scriptures with a preceptor<br>that is censurable! Let him chant the Vedas, offending at each step<br>against the rules of orthoepy! Let him disregard all his seniors!'"<br><br>"Nabhaga said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks always speak<br>false-hoods and quarrel with those that are righteous! Let him bestow his<br>daughter in marriage after accepting a pecuniary gratification offered by<br>his son-in-law!'"<br><br>"Kavi said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks he guilty of striking a<br>cow with his foot. Let him make water, facing the sun! Let him cast off<br>the person that seeks shelter at his hands!'"<br><br>"Viswamitra said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks become a servant<br>that behaves with deceit towards his master! Let him be the priest of a<br>king! Let him be the Ritwik of one that should not be assisted at his<br>sacrifices!'"<br><br>"Parvata said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks be the chief of a<br>village! Let him make journeys on asses! Let him leash hounds for a<br>living!'"<br><br>"Bharadwaja said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks be guilty of all the<br>demerits that become his who is cruel in his behaviour and untruthful in<br>speech!'"<br><br>"Ashtaka said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks be a king destitute of<br>wisdom capricious and sinful in his behaviour, and disposed to rule the<br>Earth unrighteously!'"<br><br>"Galava said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks be more infamous than a<br>sinful man! Let him be sinful in his acts towards his kinsmen and<br>relatives! Let him proclaim the gifts he makes to others!'"<br><br>"Arundhati said, 'Let her who has stolen thy stalks speak ill of her<br>mother-in-law! Let her feel disgust for her lord. Let her eat alone any<br>good food that comes to her house!'"<br><br>"The Valakhilyas said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks stand on one<br>foot at the entrance of a village (for earning his subsistence)! Let him.<br>while knowing all duties, be guilty of every breach!'"[434]<br><br>"Sunahsakha said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks be a Brahmana that<br>sleeps in happiness, having disregarded his daily Homa! Let him, after<br>becoming a religious mendicant, behave in whatever way he pleases,<br>without observing any restraint!'"<br><br>"Surabhi said, 'Let her who has stolen thy stalks be milked, with her<br>(hind) legs bound with a rope of human hair, and with the aid of a calf<br>not her own, and, while milked, let her milk be held in a vessel of white<br>brass!'[435]<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'After the Rishis and the royal sages had sworn these<br>diverse oaths, O Kuru king, the thousand-eyed chief of the deities,<br>filled with joy, cast his looks on the angered Rishi Agastya. Addressing<br>the Rishi who was very angry at the disappearance of his lotus-stalks,<br>Maghavat thus declared what was passing in his mind. Hear, O king, what<br>the words were that Indra spoke in the midst of those regenerate and<br>celestial Rishis and royal sages.'"<br><br>"Sakra said, 'Let him who has stolen thy stalks be possessed of the merit<br>of him who bestows his daughter in marriage upon a Brahmana that has duly<br>observed the vow of Brahmacharya or that has duly studied the Samans and<br>the Yajuses! Let him also have the merit of one that undergoes the final<br>bath after completing one's study of the Atharva Veda! Let him who has<br>stolen thy stalks have the merit of having studied all the Vedas. Let him<br>be observant of all duties and righteous in his behaviour! Indeed, let<br>him go to the region of Brahman!'<br><br>"Agastya said, 'Thou hast, O slayer of Vala, uttered a benediction<br>instead of a curse! (It is evident), thou hast taken my stalks!" Give<br>them to me, for that is the eternal duty!'"<br><br>"Indra said, 'O holy one, I did not remove thy stalks, led by cupidity!<br>Indeed, I removed them from desire of hearing this conclave recite what<br>the duties are that we should observe. It behoveth thee not to give way<br>to anger! Duties are the foremost of Srutis. Duties constitute the<br>eternal path (for crossing the sea of the world)! I have listened to this<br>discourse of the Rishis (on duties) that is eternal and immutable, and<br>that transcends all change![436] Do thou then, O foremost of learned<br>Brahmanas, take back these stalks of thine! O holy one, it behoves thee<br>to forgive my transgression, O thou that art free from every fault!'"<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by the chief of the deities, the<br>ascetic, viz., Agastya, who had been very angry, took back his stalks.<br>Endued with great intelligence, the Rishi became cheerful. After this,<br>those denizens of the woods proceeded to diverse other sacred waters.<br>Indeed, repairing to those sacred waters they performed their ablutions<br>everywhere. The man who reads this narrative with close attention on<br>every Parva day, will not have to become the progenitor of an ignorant<br>and wicked son. He will never be destitute of learning. No calamity will<br>ever touch him. He will, besides, be free from every kind of sorrow.<br>Decrepitude and decay will never be his. Freed from stains and evil of<br>every kind, and endued with merit, he is sure to attain to Heaven. He who<br>studies this Sastra observed by the Rishis, is sure, O prince of men, to<br>attain to the eternal region of Brahman that is full of felicity!'"[437]
