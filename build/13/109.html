                            "Yudhishthira said, 'It behoveth thee, O grandsire, to tell me what are<br>the highest, the most beneficial, and the most certain fruit of all hinds<br>of fasts k this world.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O king, to what was sung by the Self-born himself<br>and by accomplishing which a person, without doubt, attains to the<br>highest happiness. That man who fasts on the twelfth day of the moon in<br>the month called Margasirsha and worships Krishna as Kesava for the whole<br>day and night, attains to the merit of the Horse-sacrifice and becomes<br>cleansed of all his sins. He who; after the same manner, fasts on the<br>twelfth day of the moon in the month of Pausha and worships Krishna as<br>Narayana, for the whole day and night, attains to the merits of the<br>Vajapeya sacrifice and the highest success. He who fasts on the twelfth<br>day of the moon in the month of Magha and worships Krishna as Madhava,<br>for the whole day and night, attains to the merits of the Rajasuya<br>sacrifice, and rescues his own race (from misery).[504] He who fasts on<br>the twelfth day of the moon in the month of Phalguna and worships Krishna<br>as Govinda, for the whole day and night, attains to the merit of the<br>Atiratra sacrifice and goes to the region of Soma. He who fasts on the<br>twelfth day of the moon in the month of Chaitra and worship Krishna as<br>Vishnu, for the whole day and night, attains to the merit of the<br>Pundarika sacrifice and proceeds to the region of the deities. By<br>observing a similar fast on the twelfth day of the month of Vaisakha and<br>worshipping Krishna as the slayer of Madhu for the whole day and night,<br>one attains to the merits of the Agnishtoma sacrifice and proceeds to the<br>region of Soma. By observing a fast on the twelfth lunar day in the month<br>of Jyaishtha and worshipping Krishna as him who had (in Vali's sacrifice)<br>covered the universe with three steps of his, one attains to the merits<br>of the Gomedha sacrifice and sports with the Apsaras in great happiness.<br>By observing a fast on the twelfth day of the moon in the month of<br>Ashadha and worshipping Krishna as the dwarf (who beguiled the Asura king<br>Vali), one attains to the merits of the Naramedha[505] sacrifice and<br>sports in happiness with the Apsaras. By observing a fast for the twelfth<br>lunar day of the month Sravana and worshipping Krishna for day and night<br>as Sridhara, one attains to the merits of the sacrifice called<br>Panchayajna and acquires a beautiful car in Heaven whereon he sports in<br>joy. By observing a fast on the twelfth day of the moon in the month of<br>Bhadrapada and worshipping Krishna as Hrishikesa for the whole day and<br>night, one attains to the merits of the Sautramani sacrifice and becomes<br>cleansed of all sins. By observing a fast for the twelfth day of the moon<br>in the month of Aswin and worship-ping Krishna as Padmanabha, one attains<br>without doubt, to the merits of the sacrifice in which a thousand kine<br>are given away. By observing a fast for the twelfth day of the moon in<br>the month of Kartika and worshipping Krishna as Damodara, one attains,<br>without doubt, to the combined merits of all the sacrifices. He who, in<br>this way, adores Krishna for a whole year as Pundarikaksha, acquires the<br>power of recollecting the incidents of his past births and wins much<br>wealth in gold. Similarly, he who worships Krishna every day as Upendra<br>attains to identity with him. After Krishna has been worshipped in this<br>way, one should, at the conclusion of one's vow, feed a number of<br>Brahmanas or make gifts unto them of ghee. The illustrious Vishnu, that<br>ancient Being, has himself said that there is no fast that possesses<br>merits superior to what attach to fast of this kind.'"
