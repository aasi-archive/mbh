                            "Chyavana said, 'Do thou accept a boon from me. Do thou also, O chief of<br>men, tell me what the doubt is that is in thy mind. I shall certainly<br>accomplish all thy purposes.'<br><br>"Kusika said, 'If thou hast been gratified by me, O holy one, do thou<br>then, O son of Bhrigu, tell me thy object in residing in my palace for<br>sometime, for I desire to hear it. What was thy object in sleeping on the<br>bed I assigned thee for one and twenty days continuously, without<br>changing sides? O foremost of ascetics, what also was thy object, again,<br>in going out of the room without speaking a single word? Why didst thou,<br>again, without any ostensible reason, make thyself invisible, and once<br>more become visible? Why, O learned Brahmana, didst thou again, lay<br>thyself down on the bed and sleep as before for one and twenty days? For<br>what reason didst thou go out after thou wert rubbed by us with oil in<br>view of thy bath? Why also, after having caused diverse kinds of food in<br>my palace to be collected, didst thou consume them with the aid of fire?<br>What was the cause of thy sudden journey through my city on the car? What<br>object hadst thou in view in giving away so much wealth? What was thy<br>motive in showing us the wonders of the forest created by the<br>Yoga-puissance? What indeed was thy motive for showing, O great ascetic,<br>so many palatial mansions made of gold and so many bedsteads supported on<br>posts of jewels, and gems? Why also did all these wonders vanish from our<br>sight? I wish to hear the cause of all this. In thinking of all these<br>acts of thine, O perpetuator of Bhrigu's race, I became stupefied<br>repeatedly. I fail to find what the certain motive was which influenced<br>thee! O thou, that art endued with wealth of penances, I wish to hear the<br>truth about all those acts of thine in detail.'<br><br>"Chyavana said, 'Listen to me as I tell thee in detail the reasons which<br>had impelled me in all these acts of mine. Asked by thee, O monarch, I<br>cannot refuse to enlighten thee. In days past, on one occasion, when the<br>deities had assembled together, the Grandsire Brahman said some words I<br>heard them, O king, and shall presently repeat them to thee.' In<br>consequence of a contention between Brahmana and Kshatriya energy, there<br>will occur an intermixture in my race.[312] Thy grandson, O king, will<br>become endued with great energy and puissance. Hearing this, I came<br>hither, resolved to exterminate thy race. Indeed, I came, O Kusika,<br>seeking the utter extermination of thy race,&#8212;in fact, for consuming into<br>ashes all thy descendants. Impelled by this motive I came to thy palace,<br>O monarch, and said unto thee, 'I shall observe some vow. Do thou attend<br>upon me and serve me dutifully. While residing, however, in thy house I<br>failed to find any laches in thee. It is for that reason, O royal sage,<br>that thou art still alive, for otherwise thou wouldst have by this time<br>been numbered with the dead. It was with this resolution that I slept for<br>one and twenty days in the hope that somebody would awake me before I<br>arose of my own accord. Thou, however, with thy wife, didst not awaken<br>me. Even then, O best of kings, I became pleased with thee. Rising from<br>my bed I went out of the chamber without accosting any of you. I did<br>this, O monarch, in the hope that thou wouldst ask me and thus I would<br>have an opportunity of cursing thee. I then made myself invisible, and<br>again showed myself in the room of thy palace, and, once more betaking<br>myself to Yoga, slept for one and twenty days. The motive that impelled<br>me was this. Worn out with toil and hunger you two would be angry with me<br>and do what would be unpleasant to me. It was from this intention that I<br>caused thyself and thy spouse to be afflicted with hunger. In thy heart<br>however, O king, the slightest feeling of wrath or vexation did not rise.<br>For this, O monarch, I became highly delighted with thee. When I caused<br>diverse kinds of food to be brought and then set fire to them, I hoped<br>that thyself with thy wife wouldst give way to wrath at the sight. Even<br>that act however, of mine was tolerated by thee. I then ascended the car,<br>O monarch, and addressed thee, saying, 'Do thou with thy wife bear me.'<br>Thou didst what I bade, without the least scruple, O king! I became<br>filled with delight at this. The gifts of wealth I made could not provoke<br>thy anger. Pleased with thee, O king, I created with the aid of my Yoga<br>puissance that forest which thyself with thy wife didst behold here.<br>Listen, O monarch, to the object I had. For gratifying thee and thy queen<br>I caused thee to have a glimpse of heaven. All those things which thou<br>hast seen in these woods, O monarch, are a foretaste of heaven. O best of<br>kings, for a little while I caused thee and thy spouse to behold, in even<br>your earthly bodies, some sights of heaven. All this was done for showing<br>the puissance of penances and the reward that is in store for<br>righteousness. The desire that arose in thy heart, O monarch, at the<br>sight of those delightful objects, is known to me. Thou becamest desirous<br>of obtaining the status of a Brahmana and the merit of penances, O lord<br>of Earth, disregarding the sovereignty of the earth, nay, the sovereignty<br>of very heaven! That Which thou thoughtest, O king, was even this. The<br>status of a Brahmana is exceedingly difficult to obtain; after becoming a<br>Brahmana, it is exceedingly difficult to obtain the status of a Rishi;<br>for even a Rishi it is difficult to become an ascetic! I tell thee that<br>thy desire will be gratified. From thee, O Kusika, will spring a<br>Brahmana, who shall be called after thy name. The person that will be the<br>third in descent from thee shall attain to the status of a Brahmana.<br>Through the energy of the Bhrigus, thy grandson, O monarch, will be an<br>ascetic endued with the splendour of fire. He shall always strike all<br>men, indeed, the inhabitants of the three worlds, with fear. I tell thee<br>the truth. O royal sage, do thou accept the boon that is now in thy mind.<br>I shall soon set out on a tour to all the sacred waters. Time is<br>expiring.'<br><br>"Kusika said, 'Even this, O great ascetic, is a high boon, in my case,<br>for thou hast been gratified by me. Let that take place which thou hast<br>said. Let my grandson become a Brahmana, O sinless one! Indeed, let the<br>status of Brahmanahood attach to my race, O holy one. This is the boon I<br>ask for. I desire to once more ask thee in detail, O holy one! In what<br>way, O delighter of Bhrigu, will the status of Brahmanahood attach to my<br>race? Who will be my friend? Who will have my affection and<br>respect?'"[313]
