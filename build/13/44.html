                            "Yudhishthira said, "Tell me of that, O grandsire, which is the root of<br>all duties, which is the root of kinsmen, of home, of the Pitris and of<br>guests. I think this should be regarded as the foremost of all duties,<br>(viz., the marriage of one's daughter). Tell me, however, O king, upon<br>what sort of a person should one bestow one's daughter?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Having enquired into the conduct and disposition of the<br>person, his learning and acquirements, his birth, and his acts, good<br>people should then bestow their daughter upon accomplished bridegrooms.<br>All righteous Brahmanas, O Yudhishthira, act in this way (in the matter<br>of the bestowal of their daughters). This is known as the Brahma<br>marriage, O Yudhishthira! Selecting an eligible bridegroom, the father of<br>the girl should cause him to marry his daughter, having, by presents of<br>diverse kinds, induced the bridegroom to that act. This form of marriage<br>constitutes the eternal practice of all good Kshatriyas. When the father<br>of the girl', disregarding his own wishes, bestows his daughter upon a<br>person whom the daughter likes and who reciprocates the girl's<br>sentiments, the form of marriage, O Yudhishthira, is called Gandharva by<br>those that are conversant with the Vedas. The wise have said this, O<br>king, to be the practice of the Asuras, viz., wedding a girl after<br>purchasing her at a high cost and after gratifying the cupidity of her<br>kinsmen. Slaying and cutting off the heads of weeping kinsmen, the<br>bridegroom sometimes forcibly takes away the girl he would wed. Such<br>wedding, O son, is called by the name of Rakshasa. Of these five (the<br>Brahma, the Kshatra, the Gandharva, the Asura, and the Rakshasa), three<br>are righteous, O Yudhishthira, and two are unrighteous. The Paisacha and<br>the Asura forms should never be resorted to.[277] The Brahma, Kshatra,<br>and Gandharva forms are righteous, O prince of men! Pure or mixed, these<br>forms should be resorted to, without doubt. A Brahmana can take three<br>wives. A Kshatriya can take two wives. As regards the Vaisya, he should<br>take a wife from only his own order. The children born of these wives<br>should all be regarded as equal.[278] Of the three wives of a Brahmana,<br>she taken from his own order should be regarded as the foremost.<br>Similarly, of the two wives permitted to the Kshatriya, she taken from<br>his own order should be regarded as superior. Some say that persons<br>belonging to the three higher orders may take, only for purposes of<br>enjoyment (and not for those of virtue), wives from the lowest or the<br>Sudra order. Others, however, forbid the practice.<br><br>The righteous condemn the practice of begetting issue upon Sudra women. A<br>Brahmana, by begetting children upon a Sudra woman, incurs the liability<br>of performing an expiation. A person of thirty years of age should wed a<br>girl of ten years of age called a Nagnika.[279] Or, a person of one and<br>twenty years of age should wed a girl of seven years of age. That girl<br>who has no brother nor father should not be wed, O chief of Bharata's<br>race, for she may be intended as Putrika of her sire.[280] After the<br>appearance of puberty, the girl (if not married) should wait for three<br>years. On the fourth year, she should look for a husband herself (without<br>waiting any longer for her kinsmen to select one for her). The offspring<br>of such a girl do not lose their respectability, nor does union with such<br>a girl become disgraceful. If, instead of selecting a husband for<br>herself, she acts otherwise, she incurs the reproach of Prajapati<br>herself. One should wed that girl who is not a Sapinda of one's mother or<br>of the same Gotra with one's father. Even this is the usage (consistent<br>with the sacred law) which Manu has declared.'[281]<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Desirous of marriage someone actually gives a dower<br>to the girl's kinsmen; someone says, the girl's kinsmen consenting<br>promises to give a dower; someone says, 'I shall abduct the girl by<br>force;' someone simply displays his wealth (to the girl's kinsmen,<br>intending to offer a portion thereof as dower for her); someone, again,<br>actually takes the hand of the girl with rites of wedding. I ask thee, O<br>grandsire, whose wife does the girl actually become? Unto its that are<br>desirous of knowing the truth, thou art the eye with which to behold.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Whatever acts of men have been approved or settled in<br>consultation by the wise, are seen to be productive of good. False<br>speech, however, is always sinful.[282] The girl himself that becomes<br>wife, the sons born of her, the Ritwiks and preceptors and disciples and<br>Upadhyayas present at the marriage all become liable to expiation if the<br>girl bestow her hand upon a person other than he whom she had promised to<br>wed. Some are of opinion that no expiation is necessary for such conduct.<br>Manu does not applaud the practice of a girl living with a person whom<br>she does not like.[283] Living as wife with a person whom she does not<br>like, leads to disgrace and sin. No one incurs much sin in any of these<br>cases that follow. In forcibly abducting for marriage a girl that is<br>bestowed upon the abductor by the girl's kinsmen, with due rites, as also<br>a girl for whom dower has been paid and accepted, there is no great sin.<br>Upon the girl's kinsmen having expressed their consent, Mantras and Homa<br>should be resorted to. Such Mantras truly accomplish their purpose.<br>Mantras and Homa recited and performed in the case of a girl that has not<br>been bestowed by her kinsmen, do not accomplish their purpose. The<br>engagement made by the kinsmen of a girl is, no doubt, binding and<br>sacred. But the engagement that is entered into by the wedder and wedded,<br>with the aid of Mantras, is very much more so (for it is this engagement<br>that really creates the relationship of husband and wife). According to<br>the dictates of the scriptures, the husband should regard his wife as an<br>acquisition due to his own acts of a previous life or to what has been<br>ordained by God. One, therefore, incurs no reproach by accepting for wife<br>a girl that had been promised to another by her kinsmen or for whom dower<br>had been accepted by them from another.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'When after the receipt of dower for a girl, the<br>girl's sire sees a more eligible person present himself for her<br>hand,&#8212;one, that is who is endued with the aggregate of Three in<br>judicious proportions, does the girl's sire incur reproach by rejecting<br>the person from whom dower had been received in favour of him that is<br>more eligible? In such a case either alternative seems to be fraught with<br>fault, for to discard the person to whom the girl has been promised can<br>never be honourable, while to reject the person that is more eligible can<br>never be good (considering the solemn obligation there is of bestowing<br>one's daughter on the most eligible person). I ask, how should the sire<br>conduct himself so that he might be said to do that which is beneficial?<br>To us, of all duties this seems to demand the utmost measure of<br>deliberation. We are desirous of ascertaining the truth. Thou, indeed,<br>art our eyes! Do thou explain this to us. I am never satiated with<br>listening to thee!'<br><br>'Bhishma said, 'The gift of the dower does not cause the status of wife<br>to attach to the girl. This is well-known to the person paying it. He<br>pays it simply as the price of the girl. Then again they that are good<br>never bestow their daughters, led by the dowers that others may offer.<br>When the person desirous of wedding happens to be endued with such<br>qualities as do not go down with the girl's kinsmen, it is then that<br>kinsmen demand dower from him. That person, however, who won over by<br>another's accomplishments, addresses him, saying, 'Do thou wed my girl,<br>adorning her with proper ornaments of gold and gems,'&#8212;and that person<br>who complies with this request, cannot be said to demand dower or give<br>it, for such a transaction is not really a sale. The bestowal of a<br>daughter upon acceptance of what may strictly be regarded as gifts (of<br>affection or love) is the eternal practice. In matters of marriage some<br>fathers say, 'I shall not bestow my daughter upon such and such a<br>person;' some say, 'I shall bestow my daughter upon such a one.'&#8212;Some<br>again say with vehemence, 'I must bestow my daughter upon such an<br>individual.' These declarations do not amount to actual marriage. People<br>are seen to solicit one another for the hands of maidens (and promise and<br>retreat). Till the hand is actually taken with due rites, marriage cannot<br>be said to take place. It has been beard by us that' even this was the<br>boon granted to men in days of old by the Maruts in respect of<br>maidens[284]. The Rishis have laid the command upon all men that maidens<br>should never be bestowed upon persons unless the latter happen to be most<br>fit or eligible. The daughter is the root of desire and of descendants of<br>the collateral line. Even this is what I think.[285] The practice has<br>been known to human beings from a long time,&#8212;the practice, of sale and<br>purchase of the daughter. In consequence of such familiarity with the<br>practice, thou mayst be able, upon careful examination, to find<br>innumerable faults in it. The gift or acceptance of dower alone could not<br>be regarded as creating the status of husband and wife. Listen to what I<br>say on this head.<br><br>"Formerly, having defeated all the Magadhas, the Kasis, and the Kosalas,<br>I brought away by force two maidens for Vichitravirya. One of those two<br>maidens was wedded with due rites. The other maiden was not formally<br>wedded on the ground that she was one for whom dowry had been paid in the<br>form of valour. My uncle of Kuru's race, viz., king Valhika, said that<br>the maiden so brought away and not wedded with due rites should be set<br>free. That maiden, therefore, was recommended to Vichitravirya for being<br>married by him according to due rites. Doubting my father's words I<br>repaired to others for asking their opinion. I thought that my sire was<br>exceedingly punctilious in matters of morality. I then went to my sire<br>himself, O king, and addressed him these words from desire of knowing<br>something about the practices of righteous people in respect of marriage,<br>'I desire, O sire, to know what in truth the practices are of righteous<br>people.' I repeated the expression of my wish several times, so great was<br>my eagerness and curiosity. After I had uttered those words, that<br>foremost of righteous men, viz., my sire, Valhika answered me, saying,<br>'If in your opinion the status of husband and wife be taken to attach on<br>account of the gift and acceptance of dowry and not from the actual<br>taking of the maiden's hand with due rites, the father of the maiden (by<br>permitting his daughter to go away with the giver of the dowry) would so<br>himself to be the follower of a creed other than that which is derivable<br>from the ordinary scriptures. Even this is what the accepted scriptures<br>declare. Persons conversant with morality and duty do not allow that<br>their words are at all authoritative who say that the status of husband<br>and wife arises from the gift and acceptance of dowry, and not from the<br>actual taking of the hand with due rites. The saying is well-known that<br>the status of husband and wife is created by actual bestowal of the<br>daughter by the sire (and her acceptance by the husband with due rites).<br>The status of wife cannot attach to maidens through sale and purchase.<br>They who regard such status to be due to sale and the gift of dowry are<br>persons that are certainly unacquainted with the scriptures. No one<br>should bestow his daughter upon such persons. In fact, they are not men<br>to whom one may marry his daughter. A wife should never be purchased. Nor<br>should a father sell his daughter. Only those persons of sinful soul who<br>are possessed, besides, by cupidity, and who sell and purchase female<br>slaves for making serving women, regard the status of wife as capable of<br>arising from the gift and acceptance of a dowry. On this subject some<br>people on one occasion had asked prince Satyavat the following question,<br>'If the giver of a dowry unto the kinsmen of a maiden happens to die<br>before marriage, can another person take the hand of that maiden in<br>marriage? We have doubts on this matter. Do thou remove these doubts of<br>ours, for thou art endued with great wisdom and art honoured by the wise.<br>Be thou the organ of vision unto ourselves that are desirous of learning<br>the truth.' Prince Satyavat answered saying, 'The kinsmen of the maiden<br>should bestow her upon him whom they consider eligible. There need be no<br>scruples in this. The righteous act in this way without taking note of<br>the giver of the dower even if he be alive; while, as regards the giver<br>that is dead, there is not the slightest doubt. Some say that the virgin<br>wife or widow,&#8212;one, that is, whose marriage has not been consummated<br>with her husband by actual sexual congress in consequence of his absence<br>or death,&#8212;may be allowed to unite herself with her husband's younger<br>brother or such other relation. The husband dying before such<br>consummation, the virgin-widow may either surrender herself to her<br>husband's younger brother or betake herself to the practice of penances.<br>In the opinion of some, the younger brother of the husband or such other<br>relation may thus use the unused wife or widow, though others maintain<br>that such practice, notwithstanding its prevalence, springs from desire<br>instead of being a scriptural ordinance. They that say so are clearly of<br>opinion that the father of a maiden has the right to bestow her upon any<br>eligible person, disregarding the dowry previously given by another and<br>accepted by himself. If after the hand of a maiden has been promised all<br>the initial rites before marriage be performed, the maiden may still be<br>bestowed upon a person other than the one unto whom she had been<br>promised. Only the giver incurs the sin of falsehood: so far, however, as<br>the status of wife is concerned, no injury can occur thereto. The Mantras<br>in respect of marriage accomplish their object of bringing about the<br>indissoluble union of marriage at the seventh step. The maiden becomes<br>the wife of him unto whom the gift is actually made with water.[286] The<br>gift of maidens should be made in the following way. The wise know it for<br>certain. A superior Brahmana should wed a maiden that is not unwilling,<br>that belongs to a family equal to his own in purity or status, and that<br>is given away by her brother. Such a girl should be wed in the presence<br>of fire, with due rites, causing her, amongst other things, to<br>circumambulate for the usual number of times."
