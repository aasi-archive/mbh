                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Through inducements offered by wealth, or through<br>mere lust, or through ignorance of the true order of birth (of both males<br>and females), or through folly, intermixture happens of the several order<br>What, O grandsire, are the duties of persons that are born in the mixed<br>classes and what are the acts laid down for them? Do thou discourse to me<br>on this!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In the beginning, the Lord of all creatures created the<br>four orders and laid down their respective acts or duties, for the sake<br>of sacrifice.[298] The Brahmana may take four wives, one from each of the<br>four orders. In two of them (viz., the wife taken from his own order and<br>that taken from the one next below), he takes birth himself (the children<br>begotten upon them being regarded as invested with the same status as his<br>own). Those sons, however, that are begotten by him on the two spouses<br>that belong to the next two orders (viz., Vaisya and Sudra), are<br>inferior, their status being determined not by that of their father but<br>by that of their mothers. The son that is begotten by a Brahmana upon a<br>Sudra wife is called Parasara, implying one born of a corpse, for the<br>Sudra woman's body is as inauspicious as a corpse. He should serve the<br>persons of his (father's) race. Indeed, it is not proper for him to give<br>up the duty of service that has been laid down for him. Adopting all<br>means in his power, he should uphold the burden of his family. Even if he<br>happens to be elder in age, he should still dutifully serve the other<br>children of his father who may be younger to him in years, and bestow<br>upon them whatever he may succeed in earning. A Kshatriya may take three<br>wives. In two of them (viz., the one taken from his own order and the<br>other that is taken from the order immediately below), he takes birth<br>himself (so that those children are invested with the status of his own<br>order). His third wife being of the Sudra order is regarded as very<br>inferior. The son that he begets upon her comes to be called as an Ugra.<br>The Vaisya may take two spouses. In both of them (viz., the one taken<br>from his own order, and the other from the lowest of the four pure<br>orders), he takes birth himself (so that those children become invested<br>with the status of his own order). The Sudra can take only one wife,<br>viz., she that is taken from his own order. The son begotten by him upon<br>her becomes a Sudra. A son that takes birth under circumstances other<br>than those mentioned above, comes to be looked upon as a very inferior<br>one If a person of a lower order begets a son upon a woman of a superior<br>order, such a son is regarded as outside the pale of the four pure<br>orders. Indeed, such a son becomes on object of censure with the four<br>principal orders. If a Kshatriya begets a son upon a Brahmana woman, such<br>a son, without being included in any of the four pure orders, comes to be<br>regarded as a Suta The duties of a Suta are all connected with the<br>reciting of eulogies and encomiums of kings and other great men. The son<br>begotten by a Vaisya upon a woman of the Brahmana order comes to be<br>regarded as a Vaidehaka. The duties assigned to him are the charge of<br>bars and bolts for protecting the privacy of women of respectable<br>households. Such sons have no cleansing rites laid down for them.[299] If<br>a Sudra unites with a woman belonging to the foremost of the four orders,<br>the son that is begotten is called a Chandala. Endued with a fierce<br>disposition, he must live in the outskirts of cities and towns and the<br>duty assigned to him is that of the public executioner. Such sons are<br>always regarded as wretches of their race. These, O foremost of<br>intelligent persons, are the offspring of intermixed orders. The son<br>begotten by a Vaisya upon a Kshatriya woman becomes a Vandi or Magadha.<br>The duties assigned to him are eloquent recitations of praise. The son<br>begotten through transgression, by a Sudra upon a Kshatriya women,<br>becomes a Nishada and the duties assigned to him have reference to the<br>catching of fish. If a Sudra happens to have intercourse with a Vaisya<br>woman, the son begotten upon her comes to be called Ayogava. The duty<br>assigned to such a person are those of a Takshan (carpenter). They that<br>are Brahmanas should never accept gifts from such a person. They are not<br>entitled to possess any kind of wealth. Persons belonging to the mixed<br>castes beget upon spouses taken from their own castes children invested<br>with the status that is their own. When they beget children in women<br>taken from castes that are inferior to theirs, such children become<br>inferior to their fathers, for they become invested with the status that<br>belongs to their mothers Thus as regards the four pure orders, persons<br>beget children invested with their own status upon spouses taken from<br>their own orders as also upon them that are taken from the orders<br>immediately below their own. When, however, offspring are begotten upon<br>other spouses, they come to be regarded as invested with a status that<br>is, principally, outside the pale of the four pure orders. When such<br>children beget sons in women taken from their own classes, those sons<br>take the status of their sires. It is only when they take spouse from<br>castes other than their own, that the children they beget become invested<br>with inferior status. As an example of this it may be said that a Sudra<br>begets upon a woman belonging to the most superior order a son that is<br>outside the pale of the four orders (for such a son comes to be regarded<br>as a Chandala who is much inferior). The son that is outside the pale of<br>the four orders by uniting with women belonging to the four principal<br>orders, begets offspring that are further degraded in point of status.<br>From those outside the pale of the four orders and those again that are<br>further outside that pale, children multiply in consequence of the union<br>of persons with women of classes superior to their own. In this way, from<br>persons of inferior status classes spring up, altogether fifteen in<br>number, that are equally low or still lower in status. It is only from<br>sexual union of women with persons who should not have such union with<br>them that mixed classes spring up. Among the classes that are thus<br>outside the pale of the four principal or pure orders, children are<br>begotten upon women belonging to the class called Sairindhri by men of<br>the class called Magadha. The occupation of such offspring is the<br>adornment of the bodies of kinds and others. They are well-acquainted<br>with the preparation of unguents, the making of wreaths, and the<br>manufacture of articles used for the decoration of the person. Though<br>free by the status that attaches to them by birth, they should yet lead a<br>life of service. From the union of Magadhas of a certain class with women<br>of the caste called Sairindhri, there springs up another caste called<br>Ayogava. Their occupation consists in the making of nets (for catching<br>fish and fowl and animals of the chase). Vaidehas, by uniting themselves<br>with women of the Sairindhri caste, beget children called Maireyakas<br>whose occupation consists in the manufacture of wines and spirits. From<br>the Nishadas spring a caste called Madgura and another known by the name<br>of Dasas whose occupation consists in plying boats. From the Chandala<br>springs a race called Swapaka whose occupation consists in keeping guard<br>over the dead. The women of the Magadhi caste, by union with these four<br>castes of wicked dispositions produce four others who live by practising<br>deceit. These are Mansa, Swadukara, Kshaudra, and Saugandha. From the<br>Vaideha springs up a cruel and sinful caste that lives by practising<br>deception. From the Nishadas again springs up the Madranabha caste whose<br>members are seen to ride on cars drawn by asses. From the Chandalas<br>springs up the caste called Pukkasa whose members are seen to eat the<br>flesh of asses, horses and elephants. These cover themselves with the<br>garments obtained by stripping human corpses. They are again seen to eat<br>from broken earthenware[300]. These three castes of very low status are<br>born of women of the Ayogava caste (by fathers taken from different<br>castes). The caste called Kshudra springs from the Vaidehaka. The caste<br>called Andhra which takes up its residence in the outskirts of towns and<br>cities, also springs up (from the Vaidehakas). Then again the Charmakara,<br>uniting himself with a woman of Nishada caste, begets the class called<br>Karavara. From the Chandala again springs up the caste known by the name<br>of Pandusaupaka whose occupation consists in making baskets and other<br>things with cleft bamboos. From the union of the Nishada with a woman of<br>the Vaidehi caste springs one who is called by the name of Ahindaka. The<br>Chandala begets upon a Saupaka woman, a son that does not differ from the<br>Chandala in status or occupation. A Nishada woman, by union with a<br>Chandala, brings forth a son who lives in the outskirts of villages and<br>towns. Indeed, the members of such a caste live in crematoria and are<br>regarded by the very lowest orders as incapable of being numbered among<br>them. Thus to these mixed castes spring up from improper and sinful union<br>of fathers and mothers belonging to different castes. Whether they live<br>in concealment or openly, they should be known by their occupations. The<br>duties have been laid down in the scriptures for only the four principal<br>orders. As regards the others the scriptures are entirely silent. Among<br>all the orders, the members of those castes that have no duties assigned<br>to them by the scriptures, need have no fears as to what they do (to earn<br>their livelihood). Persons unaccustomed to the performance or for whom<br>sacrifices have not been laid down, and who are deprived of the company<br>and the instructions of the righteous whether numbered among the four<br>principal orders or out of their pale, by uniting themselves with women<br>of other castes, led not by considerations of righteousness but by<br>uncontrolled lust, cause numerous mixed castes to come into existence<br>whose occupations and abodes depend on the circumstances connected with<br>the irregular unions to which they owe their origin. Having recourse to<br>spots where four roads meet, or crematoria, or hills and mountains, or<br>forests and trees, they build their habitations there. The ornaments they<br>wear are made of iron. Living in such places openly, they betake<br>themselves to their own occupations to earn their livelihood. They may be<br>seen to live in this way, adorning their persons with ornaments and<br>employed in the task of manufacturing diverse kinds of domestic and other<br>utensils. Without doubt, by assisting kine and Brahmanas, and practising<br>the virtues of abstention from cruelty, compassion, truthfulness of<br>speech, and forgiveness, and, if need be, by preserving others by laying<br>down their very lives, persons of the mixed castes may achieve success. I<br>have no doubt, O chief of men, that these virtues become the causes of<br>their success. He that is possessed of intelligence, should, taking<br>everything into consideration, beget offspring according to the<br>ordinances of the scriptures, upon woman that have been declared proper<br>or fit for him. A son begotten upon a women belonging to a degraded<br>caste, instead of rescuing the sire, brings him to grief even as a heavy<br>weight brings to grief a swimmer desirous of crossing water. Whether a<br>man happens to be possessed of learning or not, lust and wrath are<br>natural attributes of humanity in this world. Women, therefore, may<br>always be seen to drag men into the wrong path. This natural disposition<br>of women is such that man's contact with her is productive of misery to<br>him. Hence, men possessed of wisdom do not suffer themselves to be<br>excessively attached to women.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'There are men who belong to the mixed castes, and<br>who are of very impure birth. Though presenting the features of<br>respectability, they are in reality disrespectable. In consequence of<br>these external aspects we may not be able to know the truth about their<br>birth. Are there any signs, O grandsire, by which the truth may be known<br>about the origin of such men?"
