                            "Bhishma said, 'Thus commanded, the lady said,&#8212;Be it so. She then<br>brought oil (for rubbing the Rishi's body therewith) and a piece of cloth<br>for his wear during the ablutions. Permitted by the ascetic, she rubbed<br>every part of his body with the fragrant oil she had brought for him.<br>Gently was the Rishi rubbed, and when the process of rubbing was over, he<br>proceeded to the room set apart for the performance of ablutions. There<br>he sat upon a new and excellent seat of great splendour.[198] After the<br>Rishi had taken his seat upon it, the old lady began to wash his person<br>with her own soft hands whose touch was exceedingly agreeable. One after<br>another in due order, the lady rendered the most agreeable services to<br>the Rishi in the matter of his ablutions. Between the lukewarm water with<br>which he was washed, and the soft hands that were employed in washing<br>him, the Rishi of rigid vows failed to understand that the whole night<br>had passed away in the process. Rising from the bath the Rishi became<br>highly surprised. He saw the Sun risen above the horizon on the East. He<br>was amazed at this and asked himself,&#8212;Was it really so or was it an<br>error of the understanding?&#8212;The Rishi then duly worshipped the god of a<br>thousand rays. This done, he asked the lady as to what he should do. The<br>old lady prepared some food for the Rishi that was as delicious to the<br>taste as Amrita itself. In consequence of the delicious character of that<br>food the Rishi could not take much. In taking that little, however, the<br>day passed away and evening came. The old lady then asked the Rishi to go<br>to bed and sleep. An excellent bed was assigned to the Rishi and another<br>was occupied by herself. The Rishi and the old lady occupied different<br>beds at first but when it was midnight, the lady left her own bed for<br>coming to that of the Rishi.'<br><br>"Ashtavakra said, 'O blessed lady, my mind turns away from sexual<br>congress with one who is the spouse of another. Leave my bed, O good<br>lady. Blessed be thou, do thou desist from this of thy own accord.'[199]<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus dissuaded by that Brahmana with the aid of his<br>self-restraint, the lady answered him, saying,&#8212;I am my own mistress. In<br>accepting me thou wilt incur no sin.'<br><br>"Ashtavakra said, 'Women can never be their own mistresses. This is the<br>opinion of the Creator himself, viz., that a woman never deserves to be<br>independent.'<br><br>"The lady said, 'O learned Brahmana, I am tortured by desire. Mark my<br>devotion to thee. Thou incurrest sin by refusing to accost me lovingly.'<br><br>"Ashtavakra said, 'Diverse faults, drag away the man that acts as he<br>likes. As regards myself, I am able to control my inclinations by<br>self-restraint. O good lady, do thou return to thy own bed.'<br><br>"The lady said, 'I bow to thee, bending my head. It behoves thee to show<br>me thy grace. O sinless one, I prostrate myself before thee, do thou<br>become my refuge. If indeed, thou seest such sin in congress with one<br>that is not thy spouse, I yield myself unto thee. Do thou, O regenerate<br>one, accept my hand in marriage. Thou wilt incur no sin. I tell thee<br>truly. Know that I am my own mistress. If there by any sin in this, let<br>it be mine alone. My heart is devoted to thee. I am my own mistress. Do<br>thou accept me.'<br><br>"Ashtavakra said, 'How is it, O good lady, that thou art thy own<br>mistress. Tell me the reason of this. There is not a single woman in the<br>three worlds that deserves to be regarded as the mistress of her own<br>self. The father protects her while she is a maiden. The husband protects<br>her while she is in youth. Sons protect her when she is aged. Women can<br>never be independent as long as they live!'<br><br>"The lady said, 'I have since my maidenhood, adopted the vow of<br>Brahmacharyya. Do not doubt it. I am still a maid. Do thou make me thy<br>wife. O Brahmana, do not kill this devotion of mine to thee.'<br><br>"Ashtavakra said, 'As thou art inclined to me, so I am inclined to thee.<br>There is this question, however, that should be settled. Is it true that<br>by yielding to my inclinations I shall not be regarded as acting in<br>opposition to what the Rishi (Vadanya) wishes. This is very wonderful.<br>Will this lead to what is beneficial? Here is a maiden adorned with<br>excellent ornaments and robes. She is exceedingly beautiful. Why did<br>decrepitude cover her beauty so long? At present she looks like a<br>beautiful maiden. There is no knowing what form she may take<br>hereafter.[200] I shall never swerve from that restraint which I have<br>over desire and the other passions or from contentment with what I have<br>already got. Such swerving does not seem to be good. I shall keep myself<br>united with truth!'[201]
