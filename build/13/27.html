                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou O grandsire, art endued with wisdom and<br>knowledge of the scriptures, with conduct and behaviour, with diverse<br>kinds of excellent attributes, and also with years. Thou art<br>distinguished above others by intelligence and wisdom and penances. I<br>shall, therefore, O thou that art the foremost of all righteous men,<br>desire to address enquiries to thee respecting Righteousness. There is<br>not another man, O king, in all the worlds, who is worthier of being<br>questioned on such subjects. O best of kings, how may one, if he happens<br>to be a Kshatriya or a Vaisya or a Sudra, succeed in acquiring the status<br>of a Brahmana? It behoveth thee to tell me the means. Is it by penances<br>the most austere, or by religious acts, or by knowledge of the<br>scriptures, that a person belonging to any of the three inferior orders<br>succeeds in acquiring the status of a Brahmana? Do tell me this, O<br>grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The status of a Brahmana, O Yudhishthira, is incapable of<br>acquisition by a person belonging to any of the three other orders. That<br>status is the highest with respect to all creatures. Travelling through<br>innumerable orders of existence, by undergoing repeated births, one at<br>last, in some birth, becomes born as a Brahmana. In this connection is<br>cited an old history, O Yudhishthira, of a conversation between Matanga<br>and a she-ass. Once on a time a Brahmana obtained a son who, though<br>procreated by a person belonging to a different order, had, however, the<br>rites of infancy and youth performed in pursuance of the ordinances laid<br>down for Brahmanas. The child was called by the name of Matanga and was<br>possessed of every accomplishment. His father, desiring to perform a<br>sacrifice, ordered him, O scorcher of foes, to collect the articles<br>required for the act. Having received the command of his father, he set<br>out for the purpose, riding on a car of great speed, drawn by an ass. It<br>so happened that the ass yoked unto that car was of tender years. Instead<br>therefore, of obeying the reins, the animal bore away the car to the<br>vicinity of its dam, viz., the she-ass that had brought it forth.<br>Matanga, dissatisfied with this, began to strike repeatedly the animal<br>with his goad on its nose. Beholding those marks of violence on her<br>child's nose, the she-ass, full of affection for him, said&#8212;Do not<br>grieve, O child, for his treatment. A chandala it is that is driving<br>thee. There is no severity in a Brahmana. The Brahmana is said to be the<br>friend of all creatures. He is the teacher also of all creatures and<br>their ruler. Can he chastise any creature so cruelly? This fellow,<br>however, is of sinful deeds. He hath no compassion to show unto even a<br>creature of such tender years as thou. He is simply proving the order of<br>his birth by conducting himself in this way. The nature which he hath<br>derived from his sire forbids the rise of those sentiments of pity and<br>kindness that are natural to the Brahmana. Hearing these harsh words of<br>the she-ass, Matanga quickly, came down from the car and addressing the<br>she-ass, said,&#8212;Tell me, O blessed dame, by what fault is my mother<br>stained? How dost thou know that I am a Chandala? Do thou answer me<br>without delay. How, indeed, dost thou know that I am a Chandala? How has<br>my status as a Brahmana been lost? O thou of great wisdom, tell me all<br>this in detail, from beginning to end.'<br><br>"The she-ass said, Begotten thou wert, upon a Brahmana woman excited with<br>desire, by a Sudra following the profession of a barber. Thou art,<br>therefore, a Chandala by birth. The status of Brahmana thou hast not at<br>all.'<br><br>"Brahmana continued, 'Thus addressed by the she-ass, Matanga retraced his<br>way homewards. Seeing him return, his father said,&#8212;I had employed thee<br>in the difficult task of gathering the requisites of my intended<br>sacrifice. Why hast thou come back without having accomplished thy<br>charge? Is it the case that all is not right with thee?<br><br>"Matanga said, 'How can he who belongs to no definite order of birth, or<br>to an order that is very low be regarded as all right and happy? How, O<br>father, can that person be happy whose mother is stained? O father, this<br>she-ass, who seems to be more than a human being, tells me that I have<br>been begotten upon a Brahmani woman by a Sudra. I shall, for this reason,<br>undergo the severest penances.&#8212;Having said these words to his father,<br>and firmly resolved upon what he had said he proceeded to the great<br>forest and began to undergo the austerest of penances. Setting himself to<br>the performance of those penances for the purpose of happily acquiring<br>the status of a Brahmana, Matanga began to scorch the very deities by the<br>severity of his asceticism. Unto him thus engaged in penances, the chief<br>of the celestials, viz., Indra, appeared and said,&#8212;Why, O Matanga, dost<br>thou pass thy time in such grief, abstaining from all kinds of human<br>enjoyments? I shall give thee boons. Do thou name the boons thou<br>desirest. Do not delay, but tell me what is in thy breast. Even if that<br>be unattainable, I shall yet bestow it on thee.'<br><br>"Matanga said, 'Desirous of attaining to the status of Brahmana I have<br>begun to practise these penances. After having obtained it, I shall go<br>home. Even this is the boon solicited by me.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Hearing these words of his, Purandara said unto him.<br>The status of a Brahmana, O Matanga, which thou desirest to acquire is<br>really unattainable by thee. It is true, thou desirest to acquire it, but<br>then it is incapable of acquisition by persons begotten on uncleansed<br>souls. O thou of foolish understanding, thou art sure to meet with<br>destruction if thou persistest in this pursuit. Desist, therefore, from<br>this vain endeavour without any delay. This object of thy desire, viz.,<br>the status of a Brahmana, which is the foremost of everything, is<br>incapable of being won by penances. Therefore, by coveting that foremost<br>status, thou wilt incur sure destruction. One born as a Chandala can<br>never attain to that status which is regarded as the most sacred among<br>the deities and Asuras and human beings!'"
