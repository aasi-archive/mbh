                            "Bhishma said, 'Then Narada, that holy Rishi, that friend of Narayana,<br>recited the following narrative of the discourse between Sankara and his<br>spouse Uma.'<br><br>"Narada said, 'Once on a time the righteous-souled lord of all the<br>deities, viz., Mahadeva with the bull for his device, practised severe<br>penances on the sacred mountains of Himavat that are the resort of<br>Siddhas and Charanas. Those delightful mountains are overgrown with<br>diverse kinds of herbs and adorned with various species of flowers. At<br>that time they were peopled by the different tribes of Apsaras and crowds<br>of ghostly beings. There the great god sat, filled with joy, and<br>surrounded by hundreds of ghostly beings who presented diverse aspects to<br>the eye of the beholder. Some of them were ugly and awkward, some were of<br>very handsome features, and some presented the most wonderful<br>appearances. Some had faces like the lion's, some like the tiger's and<br>some like the elephant's. In fact, the faces of those ghostly creatures<br>presented every variety of animal faces. Some had faces resembling that<br>of the jackal, some whose faces resembled the pard's; some like the<br>ape's, some like the bull's. Some of them had faces like the owl's; some<br>like the hawk's; some had faces like those of deer of diverse varieties.<br>The great god was also surrounded by Kinnaras and Yakshas and Gandharvas<br>and Rakshasas and diverse other created beings. The retreat to which<br>Mahadeva had betaken himself also abounded with celestial flowers and<br>blazed with celestial rays of light. It was perfumed with celestial<br>sandal, and celestial incense was burnt on every side. And it echoed with<br>the sounds of celestial instruments. Indeed, it resounded with the beat<br>of Mridangas and Panavas, the blare of conchs, and the sound of drums. It<br>teemed with ghostly beings of diverse tribes that danced in joy and with<br>peacocks also that danced with plumes outspread. Forming as it did the<br>resort of the celestial Rishis, the Apsaras danced there in joy. The<br>place was exceedingly agreeable to the sight. It was exceedingly<br>beautiful, resembling Heaven itself. Its entire aspect was wonderful and,<br>indeed, it is indescribable in respect of its beauty and sweetness.<br>Verily, with the penances of that great deity who sleeps on mountain<br>breasts, that prince of mountains shone with great beauty. It resounded<br>with the chant of the Vedas uttered by learned Brahmanas devoted to Vedic<br>recitation. Echoing with the hum of bees, O Madhava, the mountain became<br>incomparable in beauty. The ascetics, beholding the great deity who is<br>endued with a fierce form and who looks like a great festival, became<br>filled, O Janardana, with great joy. All the highly blessed ascetics, the<br>Siddhas who have drawn in their vital seed, the Maruts, the Vasus, the<br>Sadhyas, the Viswedevas, Vasava himself, the Yakshas, the Nagas, the<br>Pisachas, the Regents of the world, the several sacred Fires, the Winds,<br>and all the great creatures dwelt on that mountain with minds<br>concentrated in Yoga. All the Seasons were present there and scattered<br>those regions with all kinds of wonderful flowers. Diverse kinds of<br>blazing herbs illuminated the woods and forests on that mountain. Various<br>species of birds, filled with joy, hopped about and sang merrily on the<br>delightful beast of that mountain. Those birds were exceedingly lovable<br>in consequence of the notes they uttered. The high-souled Mahadeva sat,<br>displayed in beauty, on one of the peaks that was adorned with excellent<br>minerals, as if it served the purposes of a fine bedstead. Round his<br>loins was a tiger-skin, and a lion-skin formed his upper garments. His<br>sacred thread consisted of a snake. His arms were decked with a pair of<br>red Angadas, His beard was green. He had matted locks on his head. Of<br>terrible features, he it is that inspires with fear the hearts of all the<br>enemies of the gods. It is he, again, that assures all creatures by<br>dispelling their fears. He is adored by his worshippers as the deity<br>having the bovine bull for his device. The great Rishis, beholding<br>Mahadeva, bowed to him by touching the ground with their heads. Endued<br>with forgiving souls, they all became (in consequence of the sight they<br>had obtained of the great deity) freed from every sin and thoroughly<br>cleansed. The retreat of that lord of all creatures with many terrible<br>forms, shone with a peculiar beauty. Abounding with many large snakes, it<br>became unapproachable and unbearable (by ordinary beings). Within the<br>twinkling of the eye. O slayer of Madhu, everything there became<br>exceedingly wonderful. Indeed, the abode of that great deity having the<br>bovine bull for his device began to blaze with a terrible beauty. Unto<br>Mahadeva seated there, came his spouse, the daughter of Himavat,<br>surrounded by the wives of the ghostly beings who are the companions of<br>the great deity. Her attire was like that of her lord and the vows she<br>observed were like those of his. She held a jar on her loins that was<br>filled with the waters of every Tirtha, and was accompanied by the<br>presiding deities (of her own sex) of all the mountain streams. Those<br>auspicious ladies walked in her train. The goddess approached raining<br>flowers on every side and diverse kinds of sweet perfumes. She who loved<br>to reside on the breast of Himavat advanced in this guise towards her<br>great lord. The beautiful Uma, with smiling lips and desirous of playing<br>a jest, covered from behind, with her two beautiful hands, the eyes of<br>Mahadeva. As soon as Mahadeva's eyes were thus covered, all the regions<br>became dark and life seemed to be extinct everywhere in the universe. The<br>Homa rites ceased. The universe became suddenly deprived of the sacred<br>Vashat also. All living creatures became cheerless and filled with fear.<br>Indeed, when the eyes of the lord of all creatures were thus closed, the<br>universe seemed to become sunless. Soon, however, that overspreading<br>darkness disappeared. A mighty and blazing flame of fire emanated from<br>Mahadeva's forehead. A third eye, resembling another sun, appeared (on<br>it). That eye began to blaze forth like the Yuga-fire and began to<br>consume that mountain. The large-eyed daughter of Himavat, beholding what<br>occurred, bowed her head unto Mahadeva endued with that third eye which<br>resembled a blazing fire. She stood there with gaze fixed on her lord.<br>When the mountain forests burned on every side, with their Was and other<br>trees of straight Trunks, and their delightful sandals and diverse<br>excellent medicinal herbs, herds of deer and other animals, filled with<br>fright, came with great speed to the place where Hara sat and sought his<br>protection. With those creatures almost filling it, the retreat of the<br>great deity blazed forth with a kind of peculiar beauty. Meanwhile, that<br>fire, swelling wildly, soared up to the very heavens and endued with the<br>splendour and unsteadiness of lightning and looking like a dozen suns in<br>might and effulgence, covered every side like the all-destroying<br>Yuga-fire. In a moment, the Himavat mountains were consumed, with their<br>minerals and summits and blazing herbs. Beholding Himavat crushed and<br>consumed, the daughter of that prince of mountains sought the protection<br>of the great deity and stood before him her hands joined in reverence.<br>Then Sarva, seeing Uma overcome by an accession of womanly mildness and<br>finding that she was unwilling to behold her father Himavat reduced to<br>that pitiable plight, cast benignant looks upon the mountain. In a moment<br>the whole of Himavat was restored to his former condition and became as<br>beautiful to look at as ever. Indeed, the mountain put forth a cheerful<br>aspect. All its trees became adorned with flowers. Beholding Himavat to<br>his natural condition, the goddess Uma, divested of every fault,<br>addressed her lord, that master of all creatures, the divine Maheswara,<br>in these words.'<br><br>"Uma said, 'O holy one, O lord of all creatures, O deity that art armed<br>with the trident, O thou of high vows, a great doubt has filled my mind.<br>It behoveth thee to resolve that doubt for me. For what reason has this<br>third eye appeared in thy forehead? Why also was the mountain consumed<br>with the woods and all that belonged to it? Why also, O illustrious<br>deity, hast thou restored the mountain to its former condition? Indeed,<br>having burnt it once, why hast thou again caused it to be covered with<br>trees?'<br><br>"Maheswara said, 'O goddess without any fault, in consequence of thy<br>having covered my eyes through an act of indiscretion the universe became<br>in a moment devoid of light. When the universe became sunless and,<br>therefore, all became dark, O daughter of the prince of mountains, I<br>created the third eye desirous of protecting all creatures. The high<br>energy of that eye crushed and consumed this 'mountain. For pleasing<br>thee, however, O goddess, I once more made Himavat what he was by<br>repairing the injury.'<br><br>"Uma said, 'O holy one, why are those faces of thine which are on the<br>east, the north, and the west, so handsome and so agreeable to look at<br>like the very moon? And why is that face of thine which is on the south<br>so terrible? Why are thy matted locks tawny in hue and so erect? Why is<br>thy throat blue after the manner of the peacock's plumes? Why, O<br>illustrious deity, is the Pinaka always in thy hand? Why art thou always<br>a Brahmacharin with matted locks? O lord, it behoves thee to explain all<br>these to me. I am thy spouse who seeks to follow the same duties with<br>thee. Further, I am thy devoted worshipper, O deity, having the bull for<br>thy mark!'<br><br>"Narada continued, 'Thus addressed by the daughter of the prince of<br>mountains, the illustrious wielder of Pinaka, the puissant Mahadeva,<br>became highly gratified with her. The great god then addressed her<br>saying, 'O blessed lady, listen to me as I explain, with the reasons<br>thereof, why my forms are so.'"
