                            "Vaisampayana said,&#8212;'Equal unto Vrihaspati in intelligence and Brahma<br>himself in forgiveness, resembling Sakra in prowess and Surya in energy,<br>Bhishma the son of Ganga, of infinite might, had been overthrown in<br>battle by Arjuna. Accompanied by his brothers and many other people, king<br>Yudhisthira asked him these questions. The old hero was lying on a bed<br>that is coveted by heroes, in expectation of that auspicious time when he<br>could take leave of the physical frame. Many great Rishis had come there<br>for seeing that foremost one of Bharata's race. Amongst them were Atri<br>and Vasishtha and Bhrigu and Pulastya and Pulaha and Kratu. There were<br>also Angiras and Gotama and Agastya and Sumati of well-restrained soul,<br>and Viswamitra and Sthulasiras and Samvarta and Pramati and Dama. There<br>were also Vrihaspati and Usanas, and Vyasa and Chyavana and Kasyapa and<br>Dhruva, and Durvasas and Jamadagni and Markandeya and Galava, and<br>Bharadwaja and Raibhya and Yavakrita and Trita. There were Sthulaksha and<br>Savalaksha and Kanwa and Medhatithi and Krisa and Narada and Parvata and<br>Sudhanwa and Ekata and Dwita. There were also Nitambhu and Bhuvana and<br>Dhaumya and Satananda and Akritavrana and Rama, the son of Jamadagni and<br>Kacha. All these high-souled and great Rishis came there for seeing<br>Bhishma lying on his bed of arrows. Yudhishthira with his brothers duly<br>worshipped those high-souled Rishis who had come there, one after another<br>in proper order. Receiving that worship, those foremost of Rishis sat<br>themselves down and began to converse with one another. Their<br>conversation related to Bhishma, and was highly sweet and agreeable to<br>all the senses. Hearing that talk of theirs having reference to himself,<br>Bhishma became filled with delight and regarded himself to be already in<br>heaven. Those Rishis then, having obtained the leave of Bhishma and of<br>the Pandava princes, made themselves invisible, vanishing in the very<br>sight of all the beholders. The Pandavas repeatedly bowed and offered<br>their adorations to those highly blessed Rishis, even after they had made<br>themselves invisible. They then with cheerful souls waited upon the son<br>of Ganga, even as Brahmanas versed in Mantras wait with reverence upon<br>the rising Sun. The Pandavas beheld that the points of the compass blazed<br>forth with splendour in consequence of the energy of their penances, and<br>became filled with wonder at the sight. Thinking of the high blessedness<br>and puissance of those Rishis, the Pandava princes began to converse on<br>the subject with their grandsire Bhishma."<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The conversation being over, the righteous<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu; touched Bhishma's feet with his head and<br>then resumed his questions relating to morality and righteousness.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Which countries, which provinces, which retreats,<br>which mountains, and which rivers, O grandsire, are the foremost in point<br>of sanctity?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, "In this connection is cited the old narrative of a<br>conversation between a Brahmana in the observance of the Sila and the<br>Unccha vows, O Yudhishthira, and a Rishi crowned with ascetic success.<br>Once on a time, a foremost person, having roamed over this entire earth<br>adorned with mountains, arrived at last in the house of a foremost person<br>leading the domestic mode of life in accordance with the Sila vow. The<br>latter welcomed his guest with due rites. Received with such hospitality,<br>the happy Rishi passed the night happily in the house of his host. The<br>next morning the Brahmana in the observance of the Sila vow, having<br>finished all his morning acts and rites and purified himself duly, very<br>cheerfully approached his guest crowned with ascetic success. Meeting<br>with each other and seated at their ease, the two began to converse on<br>agreeable subjects connected with the Vedas and the Upanishads. Towards<br>the conclusion of the discourse, the Brahmana in the observance of the<br>Sila vow respectfully addressed the Rishi crowned with success. Endued<br>with intelligence, he put this very question which thou, O Yudhisthira,<br>hast put to me.'<br><br>"The poor Brahmana said, 'What countries, what provinces, what retreats,<br>what mountains, and what rivers should be regarded as the foremost in<br>point of sanctity? Do thou discourse to me on this.'<br><br>"The Rishi crowned with success said, 'Those countries, those provinces,<br>those retreats, and those mountains, should be regarded as the foremost<br>in point of sanctity through which or by the side of which that foremost<br>of all rivers, viz., Bhagirathi flows. That end which a creature is<br>capable of attaining by penances, by Brahmacharyya, by sacrifices, or by<br>practising renunciation, one is sure to attain by only living by the side<br>of the Bhagirathi and bathing in its sacred waters. Those creatures whose<br>bodies have been sprinkled with the sacred waters of Bhagirathi or whose<br>bones have been laid in the channel of that sacred stream, have not to<br>fall away&#8212;from heaven at any time.[237] Those men, O learned Brahmana,<br>who use the waters of Bhagirathi in all their acts, surely ascend to<br>heaven after departing from this world. Even those men who, having<br>committed diverse kinds of sinful deeds in the first part of their lives,<br>betake themselves in after years to a residing by the side of Ganga,<br>succeed in attaining to a very superior end. Hundreds of sacrifices<br>cannot produce that merit which men of restrained souls are capable of<br>acquiring by bathing in the sacred waters of Ganga. A person is treated<br>with respect and worshipped in heaven for as long a period as his bones<br>lie in the channel of the Ganga. Even as the Sun, when he rises at the<br>dawn of day, blazes forth in splendour, having dispelled the gloom of<br>night, after the same manner the person that has bathed in the waters of<br>Ganga is seen to shine in splendour, cleansed of all his sins. Those<br>countries and those points of the compass that are destitute of the<br>sacred waters of Ganga are like nights without the moon or like trees<br>without flowers. Verily, a world without Ganga is like the different<br>orders and modes of life when they are destitute of righteousness or like<br>sacrifices without Soma. Without doubt, countries and points of the<br>compass that are without Ganga are like the firmament without the Sun, or<br>the Earth without mountains, or the welkin without air. The entire body<br>of creatures in the three worlds, if served with the auspicious waters of<br>Ganga, derive a pleasure, the like of which they are incapable of<br>deriving from any other source. He who drinks Ganga water that has been<br>heated by the Sun's rays derives merit much greater than that which<br>attaches to the vow of subsisting upon the wheat or grains of other corn<br>picked up from cowdung. It cannot be said whether the two are equal or<br>not, viz., he who performs a thousand Chandrayana rites for purifying his<br>body and he who drinks the water of Ganga. It cannot be said whether the<br>two are equal or not, viz., one who stands for a thousand years on one<br>foot and one who lives for only a month by the side of Ganga. One who<br>lives permanently by the side of Ganga is superior in merit to one who<br>stays for ten thousand Yugas with head hanging downwards. As cotton, when<br>it comes into contact with fire, is burnt off without a remnant, even so<br>the sins of the person that has bathed in Ganga become consumed without a<br>remnant. There is no end superior to Ganga for those creatures who with<br>hearts afflicted by sorrow, seek to attain to ends that may dispel that<br>sorrow of theirs. As snakes become deprived of their poison at the very<br>sight of Garuda, even so one becomes cleansed of all one's sins at the<br>very sight of the sacred stream of Ganga. They that are without good name<br>and that are addicted to deeds of sinfulness, have Ganga for their fame,<br>their protection, their means of rescue, their refuge or cover. Many<br>wretches among men who become afflicted with diverse sins of a heinous<br>nature, when they are about to sink into hell, are rescued by Ganga in<br>the next world (if, notwithstanding their sins, they seek the aid of<br>Ganga in their after-years). They, O foremost of intelligent men, who<br>plunge every day in the sacred waters of Ganga, become the equals of<br>great Munis and the very deities with Vasava at their head. Those<br>wretches among men that are destitute of humility or modesty of behaviour<br>and that are exceedingly sinful, become righteous and good, O Brahmana,<br>by betaking themselves to the side of Ganga. As Amrita is to the deities,<br>as Swadha is to the Pritis, as Sudha is to the Nagas, even so is Ganga<br>water to human beings. As children afflicted with hunger solicit their<br>mothers for food, after the same manner do people desirous of their<br>highest good pay court to Ganga. As the region of the self-born Brahma is<br>said to be the foremost of all places, even so is Ganga said to be<br>foremost of all rivers for those that desire to bathe. As the Earth and<br>the cow are said to be the chief sustenance of the deities and other<br>celestials, even so is Ganga the chief sustenance of all living<br>creatures.[238] As the deities support themselves upon the Amrita that<br>occurs in the Sun and the Moon and that is offered in diverse sacrifices,<br>even so do human beings support themselves upon Ganga water. One<br>besmeared with the sand taken from the shores of Ganga regards oneself as<br>a denizen of heaven, adorned with celestial unguents. He who bears on his<br>head the mud taken from the banks of Ganga presents an effulgent aspect<br>equal to that of Sun himself bent on dispelling the surrounding darkness.<br>When that wind which is moistened with the particles of Ganga-water<br>touches one's person, it cleanses him immediately of every sin. A person<br>afflicted by calamities and about to sink under their weight, finds all<br>his calamities dispelled by the joy which springs up in his heart at<br>sight of that sacred stream. By the melody of the swans and Kokas and<br>other aquatic fowls that play on her breast, Ganga challenges the very<br>Gandharvas and by her high banks the very mountains on the Earth.<br>Beholding her surface teeming with swans and diverse other aquatic fowls,<br>and having banks adorned with pasture lands with kine grazing on them.<br>Heaven herself loses her pride. The high happiness which one enjoys by a<br>residence on the banks of Ganga, can never be his who is residing even in<br>heaven. I have no doubt in this that the person who is afflicted with<br>sins perpetrated in speech and thought and overt act, becomes cleansed at<br>the very sight of Ganga. By holding that sacred stream, touching it, and<br>bathing in its waters, one rescues one's ancestors to the seventh<br>generation, one's descendants to the seventh generation, as also other<br>ancestors and descendant. By hearing of Ganga, by wishing to repair to<br>that river, by drinking its waters, by touching its waters, and by<br>bathing in them a person rescues both his paternal and maternal races. By<br>seeing, touching, and drinking the waters of Ganga, or even by applauding<br>Ganga, hundreds and thousands of sinful men became cleansed of all their<br>sins. They who wish to make their birth, life and learning fruitful,<br>should repair to Ganga and gratify the Pitris and the deities by offering<br>them oblations of water. The merit that one earns by bathing in Ganga is<br>such that the like of it is incapable of being earned through the<br>acquisition of sons or wealth or the performance of meritorious acts.<br>Those who, although possessed of the physical ability, do not seek to<br>have a sight of the auspicious Ganga of sacred current, are, without<br>doubt, to be likened to persons afflicted with congenital blindness or<br>those that are dead or those that are destitute of the power of<br>locomotion through palsy or lameness. What man is there that would not<br>reverence this sacred stream that is adored by great Rishis conversant<br>with the Present, the Past, and the Future, as also by the very deities<br>with Indra at their head. What man is there that would not seek the<br>protection of Ganga whose protection is sought for by forest recluses and<br>householders, and by Yatis and Brahmacharins alike? The man of righteous<br>conduct who, with rapt soul, thinks of Ganga at the time when his<br>life-breaths are about to leave his body, succeeds in attaining to the<br>highest end. That man who dwells by the side of Ganga up to the time of<br>his death, adoring her with reverence, becomes freed from the fear of<br>every kind of calamity, of sin, and of kings. When that highly sacred<br>stream fell from the firmament. Maheswara held it on his head. It is that<br>very stream which is adored in heaven.[239] The three regions, viz.,<br>(Earth, Heaven, and the nether place called Patala) are adorned by the<br>three courses of this sacred stream. The man who uses the waters of that<br>stream becomes certainly crowned with success. As the solar ray is to the<br>deities in heaven, as Chandramas is to the Pitris, as the king is to<br>human beings, even such is Ganga unto all streams.[240] One who becomes<br>bereaved of mother or father or sons or spouses or wealth does not fell<br>that grief which becomes one's, when one becomes bereaved of Ganga. One<br>does not obtain that joy through acts that lead to the region of Brahma,<br>or through such sacrifices and rites that lead to heaven, or through<br>children or wealth, which one obtain from a sight of Ganga.[241] The<br>pleasures that men derive from a sight of Ganga is equal to what they<br>derive from a sight of the full moon. That man becomes dear to Ganga who<br>adores her with deep devotion, with mind wholly fixed upon her, with a<br>reverence that refuses to take any other object within its sphere, with a<br>feeling that there is nothing else to the universe worthy of similar<br>adoration, and with a steadiness that knows no failing away. Creatures<br>that live on Earth, in the welkin, or in Heaven, indeed, even beings that<br>are very superior,&#8212;should always bathe in Ganga. Verily, this is the<br>foremost of all duties with those that are righteous. The fame of Ganga<br>for sanctity has spread over the entire universe, since she bore all the<br>sons of Sagara, who had been reduced to ashes, from here to Heaven.[242]<br>Men who are washed by the bright, beautiful, high, and rapidly moving<br>waves, raised by the wind, of Ganga, became cleansed of all their sins<br>and resemble in splendour the Sun with his thousand rays. Those men of<br>tranquil souls that have cast off their bodies in the waters of Ganga<br>whose sanctity is as great as that of the butter and other liquids poured<br>in sacrifices and which are capable of conferring merits equal to those<br>of the greatest of sacrifices, have certainly attained to a station equal<br>to that of the very deities. Verily, Ganga, possessed of fame and vast<br>extent and identical with the entire universe and reverenced by the<br>deities with Indra at their head, the Munis and human beings, is<br>competent to bestow the fruition of all their wishes upon them that are<br>blind, them that are idiots, and them that are destitute of all<br>things.[243] They that sought the refuge of Ganga, that protectress of<br>all the universe, that flows in three streams, that is filled with water<br>at once highly sacred and sweet as honey and productive of every kind of<br>good, have succeeded in attaining to the beatitude of Heaven.[244] That<br>mortal who dwells by the side of Ganga and beholds her every day, becomes<br>cleansed by her sight and touch. Unto him the deities give every kind of<br>happiness here and a high end hereafter. Ganga is regarded as competent<br>to rescue every creature from sin and lead him to the felicity of Heaven.<br>She is held to be identical with Prisni, the mother of Vishnu. She is<br>identical with the Word or Speech. She is very remote, being incapable of<br>easy attainment. She is the embodiment of auspiciousness and prosperity.<br>She is capable of bestowing the six well-known attributes beginning with<br>lordship or puissance. She is always inclined to extend her grace. She is<br>the displayer of all things in the universe, and she is the high refuge<br>of all creatures. Those who have sought her protection in this life have<br>surely attained heaven. The fame of Ganga has spread all over the welkin,<br>and Heaven, and Earth, and all the points, cardinal and subsidiary, of<br>the compass. Mortal creatures, by using the waters of that foremost of<br>streams, always become crowned with high success. That person who himself<br>beholding Ganga, points her out to others, finds that Ganga rescues him<br>from rebirth and confers Emancipation on him. Ganga held Guha, the<br>generalissimo of the celestial forces, in her womb. She bears the most<br>precious of all metals, viz., gold, also in that womb of hers. They who<br>bathe in her waters every day in the morning, succeed in obtaining the<br>aggregate of three, viz., Righteousness, Wealth and Pleasure. Those<br>waters are, again, equal in point of sanctity to the butter that is<br>poured with Mantras on the sacrificial fire. Capable of cleansing one<br>from every sin, she has descended from the celestial region, and her<br>current is held in high esteem by every one. Ganga is the daughter of<br>Himavat, the spouse of Hara, and the ornament of both Heaven and Earth.<br>She is the bestower of everything auspicious, and is competent to confer<br>the six well-known attributes beginning with lordship or puissance.<br>Verily O king, Ganga is the one object of great sanctity in the three<br>worlds and confers merit upon all. Truly, O monarch, Ganga is<br>Righteousness in liquefied form. She is energy also running in a liquid<br>form over the Earth. She is endued with the splendour or puissance that<br>belongs to the butter that is poured with Mantras on the sacrificial<br>fire. She is always adorned with large waves as also with Brahmanas who<br>may at all times be seen performing their ablutions in her waters.<br>Falling from Heaven, she was held by Siva on his head. The very mother of<br>the heavens, she has sprung from the highest mountain for running over<br>the plains and conferring the most precious benefits on all creatures of<br>the Earth. She is the highest cause of all things; she is perfectly<br>stainless. She is as subtile as Brahma. She affords the best bed for the<br>dying. She leads creatures very quickly to heaven. She bears away a large<br>volume of water. She bestows great fame on all. She is the protectress of<br>the universe.[245] She is identical with every form. She is very much<br>coveted by persons crowned with success. Verily, Ganga is the path to<br>Heaven of those that have bathed in her current.[246] The Brahmanas hold<br>Ganga as equalling the Earth in forgiveness, and in the protection and<br>upholding of those that live by her; further, as equalling Fire and Surya<br>in energy and splendour; and, lastly, as always equalling Guha himself in<br>the matter of showing favours unto the regenerate class.[247] Those men<br>who, in this life, even mentally seek with their whole souls that sacred<br>stream which is praised by the Rishis, which has issued out of the feet<br>of Vishnu, which is very ancient, and which is exceedingly sacred,<br>succeed in repairing to the regions of Brahman. Fully convinced that<br>children and other possessions, as also regions possessed by every kind<br>of felicity, are transitory or liable to destruction, men of subdued<br>souls, who are desirous of attaining to that everlasting station which is<br>identical with Brahma, always pay their adorations to Ganga with that<br>reverence and love which are due from a son to mother. The men of<br>cleansed soul who is desirous of achieving success should seek the<br>protection of Ganga who is like a cow that yields Amrita instead of<br>ordinary milk, who is prosperity's self, who is possessed of omniscience,<br>who exists for the entire universe of creatures, who is the source of all<br>kinds of food, who is the mother of all mountains, who is the refuge of<br>all righteous persons, who is immeasurable in puissance and energy, and<br>who charms the heart of Brahma himself. Having, with austere penances,<br>gratified all the deities with the Supreme Lord (Vishnu), Bhagiratha<br>brought Ganga down on the Earth. Repairing unto her, men always succeed<br>in freeing themselves from every kind of fear both here and hereafter.<br>Observing with the aid of intelligence, I have mentioned to thee only a<br>small part of the merits of Ganga. My power, however, is inadequate to<br>speak of all the merits of the sacred river, or, indeed, to measure her<br>puissance and sanctity. One may, by putting forth one's best powers,<br>count the stones that occur in the mountains of Meru or measure the<br>waters that occur in the ocean, but one cannot count all the merits which<br>belong to the waters of Ganga. Hence, having listened to these particular<br>merits of Ganga which I have uttered with great devotion, one should, in<br>thought, word and deed, reverence them with faith and devotion. In<br>consequence of thy having listened to those merits which I have recited,<br>thou art sure to fill all the three regions with fame and attain to a<br>measure of success that is very large and that is difficult of being<br>attained to by any other person. Verily, thou shalt, soon after that,<br>sport in joy many a region of great felicity created by Ganga herself for<br>those that reverence her. Ganga always extends her grace unto those that<br>are devoted to her with humbleness of heart. She unites those that are so<br>devoted to her with every kind of happiness. I pray that the<br>highly-blessed Ganga may always inspire thy heart and mine with such<br>attributes as are fraught with righteousness'.<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The learned ascetic endued with high intelligence<br>and great illumination, and crowned with success, having in this manner<br>discoursed unto that poor Brahmana in the observance of the Sila vow, on<br>the subjects of the infinite merits of Ganga, then ascended the<br>firmament. The Brahmana in the observance of Sila vow, awakened by the<br>words of that ascetic crowned with success, duly worshipped Ganga and<br>attained to high success. Do thou also, O son of Kunti, seek Ganga with<br>great devotion, for thou shalt then, as the reward thereof, attain to<br>high and excellent success.<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued 'Hearing this discourse from Bhishma that was<br>fraught with the praise of Ganga, Yudhishthira with his brothers became<br>filled with great delight. That person who recites or hears recited this<br>sacred discourse fraught with the praise of Ganga, becomes cleansed of<br>every sin.'"
