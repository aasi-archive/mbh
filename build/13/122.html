                            "Bhishma said, 'Thus addressed, the holy one replied unto Maitreya,<br>saying 'by good luck, thou art endued with knowledge. By good luck, thy<br>understanding is of this kind! They that are good highly applaud all<br>righteous attributes. That personal beauty and youth and prosperity do<br>not succeed in overwhelming thee is due to good luck. This favour done to<br>thee is due to the kindness of the deities. Listen to me as I discourse<br>to thee upon what is even superior (in efficacy) to gift. Whatever<br>scriptures and religious treatises there are, whatever (righteous)<br>inclinations are observable in the world, they have flowed in their due<br>order, agreeably with the lead of the Vedas, according to their due<br>order. Following them I applaud gift. Thou praisest penances and Vedic<br>lore. Penances are sacred. Penances are the means by which one may<br>acquire the Vedas and heaven also. With the aid of penances and of<br>knowledge, one attains to the highest fruits, we have heard. It is by<br>penances that one destroys one's sins and all else that is evil. It has<br>been heard by us that with whatever purpose in view one undergoes<br>penances, one attains the fruition thereof in consequence of those<br>penances. The same may be said of knowledge. Whatever is difficult to<br>accomplish, whatever is difficult to conquer, what is difficult to<br>attain, and whatever is difficult to cross, can all be achieved with the<br>aid of penances. Of all things, penances are possessed of very superior<br>might. The man who drinks alcohol, or he that takes by force what belongs<br>to others, or he that is guilty of foeticide, or he that violates the bed<br>of his preceptor, succeeds in crossing with the aid of penances. Indeed,<br>one becomes cleansed of all these sins through penances. One possessed of<br>all knowledge and, therefore, having true vision, and an ascetic of<br>whatever kind, are equal. One should always bow unto these two[536]. All<br>men who have the Vedas for their wealth should be worshipped. Similarly,<br>all men endued with penances deserve to be worshipped. Those who make<br>gifts obtain happiness hereafter and much prosperity here. Righteous men<br>of this world, by making gifts of food obtain both this world and that of<br>Brahman himself with many other regions of superior felicity. Those men<br>who are adored by all, themselves adore him who makes gifts. Those men<br>that are honoured everywhere themselves honour him who make gifts.<br>Wherever the giver goes, he bears himself praised, He who does acts and<br>he who omits to do them gets each what is proportionate to his acts and<br>omissions. Whether one dwells in the upper regions or in the nether, one<br>always attains to those places to which one becomes entitled by one's<br>acts. As regards thyself, thou wilt certainly obtain whatever food and<br>drink thou mayst covet, Tot thou art endued with intelligence, good<br>birth, Vedic lore, and compassion! Thou art possessed of youth, O<br>Maitreya! Thou art observant of vows. Be thou devoted to Righteousness.<br>Do thou take instructions from me regarding those duties which thou<br>shouldst first follow,&#8212;the duties, viz., of householders. In that house<br>in which the husband is gratified with his wedded wife, and the wife<br>gratified with her husband, all auspicious results ensue. As filth is<br>washed away from the body with water, as darkness is dispelled by the<br>splendour of fire even so is sin washed off by gifts and penances. Bless<br>thee, O Maitreya, let mansions be thine! I depart hence in peace. Do thou<br>keep in mind what I have said. Thou shalt then be able to reap many<br>advantages! Maitreya then walked round his illustrious guest and bowed<br>his head unto him, and joining his hands in reverence said, 'Let blessing<br>be to thee also, O holy one!"
