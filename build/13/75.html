                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I have been greatly assured, O thou of puissance, by<br>thee thus discoursing unto me of duties. I shall, however, give<br>expression to the doubts I have. Do thou explain them to me, O grandsire!<br>What are the fruits, declared in the scriptures, of the vows that men<br>observe. Of what nature are the fruits, O thou of great splendour, of<br>observances of other kinds? What, again, are the fruits, of one's<br>studying the Vedas properly?[365] What are the fruits of gifts, and what<br>those of holding the Vedas in memory? What are the fruits that attach to<br>the teaching of the Vedas? I desire to know all this. What, O grandsire,<br>are the merits attaching to the non-acceptance of gifts in this world?<br>What fruits are seen to attach to him who mazes gifts of knowledge? What<br>are the merits acquired by persons that are observant of the duties of<br>their order, as also by heroes that do not flee from battle? What are the<br>fruits that have been declared to attach to the observance of purity and<br>to the practice of Brahmacharya? What are the merits that attach to the<br>service of the father and of the mother? What also are the merits of<br>serving preceptors and teachers, and what are the merits of compassion<br>and kindness? I desire to know all these, O grandsire, truly and in<br>detail, O thou that art conversant with all the scriptures! Great is the<br>curiosity f feel.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Eternal regions of felicity become his, who, having<br>properly commenced a Vrata (vow) completes its observance according to<br>the scriptures, without a break. The fruits of Niyamas, O king, are<br>visible even in this world. These rewards that thou hast won are those of<br>Niyamas and sacrifices. The fruits that attach to the study of the Vedas<br>are seen both here and hereafter. The person, who is devoted to the study<br>of the Vedas is seen to sport in felicity both in this world and in the<br>region of Brahma. Listen now to me, O king, as I tell thee in detail what<br>the fruits are of self-restraint. They that are self-restrained are happy<br>everywhere. They that are self-restrained are always in the enjoyment of<br>that felicity which attaches to the absence or subjugation of desire.<br>They that are self-restrained are competent to go everywhere at will.<br>They that are self-restrained are capable of destroying every foe.<br>Without doubt, they that are self-restrained succeed in obtaining<br>everything they seek. They that are self-restrained, O son of Pandu,<br>obtain the fruition of every wish. The happiness that men enjoy in heaven<br>through penances and prowess (in arms) through gift, and through diverse<br>sacrifices, becomes theirs that are self-restrained and forgiving.<br>Self-restraint is more meritorious than gift. A giver, after making a<br>gift unto the Brahmanas, may yield to the Influence of wrath. A<br>self-restrained man, however, never yields to wrath. Hence,<br>self-restraint is superior (in point of merit) to gift. That man, who<br>makes gifts without yielding to wrath, succeeds in attaining to eternal<br>regions of felicity. Wrath destroys the merit of a gift. Hence,<br>self-restraint is superior to gift. There are various invisible places, O<br>monarch, numbering by ten thousands, in heaven. Existing in all the<br>regions of heaven, these places belong to the Rishis. Persons, leaving<br>this world, attain to them and become transformed into deities. O king,<br>the great Rishis repair thither, aided only by their self-restraint, and<br>as the end of their efforts to attain to a region of superior happiness.<br>Hence, self-restraint is superior (in efficacy) to gift. The person, who<br>becomes a preceptor (for teaching the Vedas), and who duly worships the<br>fire, taking leave of all his afflictions in this world, enjoys<br>inexhaustible felicity, O king, in the region of Brahma. That man, who,<br>having himself studied the Vedas, imparts a knowledge thereof unto<br>righteous disciples, and who praises the acts of his own preceptor,<br>attain to great honours in heaven. That Kshatriya, who takes to the study<br>of the Vedas, to the performance of sacrifices, to the making of gifts,<br>and who rescues the lives of others in battle, similarly attains to<br>great, honours in heaven. The Vaisya, who, observant of the duties of his<br>order, makes gifts, reaps as the fruit of those gifts, a crowning reward.<br>The Sudra, who duly observes the duties of his order (which consist of<br>services rendered to the three other orders) wins heaven as the reward of<br>such services. Diverse kinds of heroes have been spoken of (in the<br>scriptures). Listen to me as I expound to thee what the rewards are that<br>they attain to. The rewards are fixed of a hero belonging to a heroic<br>race. There are heroes of sacrifice, heroes of self-restraint, heroes of<br>truth, and others equally entitled to the name of hero. There are heroes<br>of battle, and heroes of gift of liberality among men. There are many<br>persons, who may be called the heroes of the Sankhya faith as, indeed,<br>there are many others that are called heroes of Yoga. There are others<br>that are regarded as heroes in the matter of forest-life, of householding<br>or domesticity, and of renunciation (or Sannyasa). Similarly, there are<br>others that are called heroes of the intellect, and also heroes of<br>forgiveness. There are other men, who live in tranquillity and who are<br>regarded as heroes of righteousness. There are diverse other kinds of<br>heroes that practise diverse other kinds of vows and observances. There<br>are heroes devoted to the study of the Vedas and heroes devoted to the<br>teaching of the same. There are, again, men that come to be regarded as<br>heroes for the devotion with which they wait upon and serve their<br>preceptors, as indeed, heroes in respect of the reverence they show to<br>their sires. There are heroes in respect of obedience to mothers, and<br>heroes in the matter of the life of mendicancy they lead. There are<br>heroes in the matter of hospitality to guests, whether living as<br>householders. All these heroes attain to very superior, regions of<br>felicity which are, of course, acquired by them as the rewards of their<br>own acts. Holding all the Vedas in memory, or ablutions performed in all<br>the sacred waters, may or may not be equal to telling the Truth every day<br>in one's life. A thousand horse sacrifices and Truth were once weighed in<br>the balance. It was seen that Truth weighed heavier than a thousand<br>horse-sacrifices. It is by Truth that the sun is imparting heat, it is by<br>Truth that fire blazes up, it is by Truth that the winds blow; verily,<br>everything rests upon Truth. It is Truth that gratifies the deities, the<br>Pitris and the Brahmanas. Truth has been said to be the highest duty.<br>Therefore, no one should ever transgress Truth. The Munis are all devoted<br>to Truth. Their prowess depends upon Truth. They also swear by Truth.<br>Hence, Truth is pre-eminent. All truthful men, O chief of Bharata's race,<br>succeed by their truthfulness in attaining to heaven and sporting there<br>in felicity. Self-restraint is the attainment of the reward that attaches<br>to Truth. I have discoursed on it with my whole heart. The man of humble<br>heart who is possessed of self-restraint, without doubt, attains to great<br>honours in heaven. Listen now to me, O lord of Earth, as I expound to<br>thee the merits of Brahmacharya. That man, who practises the vow of<br>Brahmacharya from his birth to the time of his death, know, O king, has<br>nothing unattainable! Many millions of Rishis are residing in the region<br>of Brahma. All of them, while here, were devoted to Truth, and<br>self-restrained and had their vital seed drawn up. The vow of<br>Brahmacharya, O king, duly observed by a Brahmana, is sure to burn all<br>his sins. The Brahmana is said to be a blazing fire. In those Brahmanas<br>that are devoted to penances, the deity of fire becomes visible. If a<br>Brahmacharin yields to wrath in consequence of any slight the chief of<br>the deities himself trembles in fear. Even this is the visible fruit of<br>the vow of Brahmacharya that is observed by the Rishis. Listen to me, O<br>Yudhishthira, what the merit is that attaches to the worship of the<br>father and the mother. He, who dutifully serves his father without ever<br>crossing him in anything, or similarly serves his mother or (elder)<br>brother or other senior or preceptor, it should be known, O king, earns a<br>residence in heaven. The man of cleansed soul, in consequence of such<br>service rendered to his seniors, has never even to behold hell.'"
