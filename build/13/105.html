                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O chief of Bharata's race, how the eldest<br>brother should behave towards his younger brothers and how the younger<br>brothers should behave towards their eldest brother.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Do thou, O son, always behave towards thy younger<br>brothers as their eldest brother should. Thou art always the eldest of<br>all these thy brothers. That high conduct which the preceptor should<br>always adopt towards his disciples should be adopted by thee towards thy<br>younger brothers. If the preceptor happens to be unendued with wisdom,<br>the disciple cannot possibly behave towards him in a respectful or proper<br>way. If the preceptor happens to be possessed of purity and highness of<br>conduct, the disciple also succeeds in attaining to conduct of the same<br>kind, O Bharata. The eldest brother should at times be blind to the acts<br>of his younger brothers, and though possessed of wisdom should at times<br>act as if he does not understand their acts. If the younger brothers be<br>guilty of any transgression, the eldest brother should correct them by<br>indirect ways and means. If there be good understanding among brothers<br>and if the eldest brother seek to correct his younger brothers by direct<br>or ostensible means, persons that are enemies, O son of Kunti, that are<br>afflicted with sorrow at the sight of such good understanding and who,<br>therefore, always seek to bring about a disunion, set themselves to<br>disunite the brothers and cause dissension among them. It is the eldest<br>brother that enhances the prosperity of the family or destroys it<br>entirely. If the eldest brother happens to be unendued with sense and<br>wicked in behaviour, he brings about the destruction of the whole family.<br>The eldest brother who injures his younger brothers ceases to be regarded<br>as the eldest and forfeits his share in the family property and deserves<br>to be checked by the king. That man who acts deceitfully, has, without<br>doubt, to go to regions of grief and every kind of evil. The birth of<br>such a person serves no useful purpose even as the flowers of the<br>cane.[486] That family in which a sinful person takes birth becomes<br>subject to every evil. Such a person brings about infamy, and all the<br>good acts of the family disappear. Such among the brothers as are wedded<br>to evil acts forfeit their shares of the family property. In such a case;<br>the eldest brother may appropriate the whole Yautuka property without<br>giving any portion thereof to his younger brothers. If the eldest brother<br>makes any acquisition, without using the paternal property and by going<br>to a distant place he may appropriate for his own use, such acquisitions,<br>without giving any share thereof to his younger brothers. If unseparated<br>brothers desire (during the lifetime of their father) to portion the<br>family property, the father should give equal shares unto all his sons.<br>If the eldest brother happens to be of sinful acts and undistinguished by<br>accomplishments of any kind he may be disregarded by his younger<br>brothers. If the wife or the younger brother happens to be sinful, her or<br>his good must still be looked after. Persons conversant with the efficacy<br>of righteousness say that righteousness is the highest good. The<br>Upadhyaya is superior to even ten Acharyas. The sire is equal to ten<br>Upadhyayas. The mother is equal to ten sires or even the whole earth.<br>There is no senior equal to the mother Verily, she transcends all in<br>respect of the reverence due to her.[487] It is for this reason that<br>people regard the mother to deserve so much reverence. After the father<br>has ceased to breathe, O Bharata, the eldest brother should be regarded<br>as the father. It is the eldest brother who should assign unto them their<br>means of support and protect and cherish them. All the younger brothers<br>should bow to him and obey his authority. Indeed, they should live in<br>dependence upon him even as they did upon their father while he was<br>alive. So far as the body is concerned, O Bharata, it is the father and<br>the mother that create it. That birth, however, which the Acharya<br>ordains, is regarded as the true birth, that is, besides, really unfading<br>and immortal. The eldest sister, O chief of Bharata's race, is like unto<br>the mother The wife of the eldest brother also is like unto the mother,<br>for the younger brother, in infancy, receives, suck from her.'"[488]
