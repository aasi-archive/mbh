                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I have heard this great narrative, O perpetuator of<br>Kuru's race. Thou, O foremost of eloquent men, hast said that the status<br>of a Brahmana is exceedingly difficult of acquisition. It is heard,<br>however, that in former times the status of a Brahmana had been acquired<br>by Viswamitra. Thou, however, O best of men, tellest us that status is<br>incapable of being acquired. I have also heard that king Vitahavya in<br>ancient times succeeded in obtaining the status of a Brahmana. I desire<br>to hear, O puissant son of Ganga, the story of Vitahavya's promotion. By<br>what acts did that best of kings succeed in acquiring the status of a<br>Brahmana? Was it through some boon (obtained from some one of great<br>puissance) or was it through the virtue of penances? It behoveth thee to<br>tell me everything.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Hear, O monarch, how the royal sage Vitahavya of great<br>celebrity succeeded in ancient times in acquiring the status of a<br>Brahmana that is so difficult to attain and that is held in such high<br>reverence by all the world. While the high-souled Manu in days of yore<br>was employed in righteously ruling his subjects, he obtained a son of<br>righteous soul who became celebrated under the name of Saryati. In<br>Saryati's, race, O monarch, two kings took their birth, viz., Haihaya and<br>Talajangha. Both of them were sons of Vatsa, O foremost of victorious<br>kings. Haihaya, O monarch, had ten wives. Upon them he begot, O Bharata,<br>a century of sons all of whom were highly inclined to fighting. All of<br>them resembled one another in features and prowess. All of them were<br>endued with great strength and all of them were possessed of great skill<br>in battle. They all studied the Vedas and the science of weapons<br>thoroughly. In Kasi also, O monarch, there was a king who was the<br>grandfather of Divodasa. The foremost of victorious men, he was known by<br>the name of Haryyaswa. The sons of king Haihaya, O chief of men (who was<br>otherwise known by the name of Vitahavya), invaded the kingdom of Kasi<br>and advancing to the country that lies between the rivers Ganga and<br>Yamuna, fought a battle with king Haryyaswa and also slew him in it.<br>Having slain king Haryyaswa in this way, the sons of Haihaya, those great<br>car-warriors, fearlessly went back to their own delightful city in the<br>country of the Vatsas. Meanwhile Haryyaswa's son Sudeva, who looked like<br>a deity in splendour and who was a second god of righteousness, was<br>installed on the throne of Kasi as its ruler. The delighter of Kasi, that<br>righteous-souled prince ruled his kingdom for sometime, when the hundred<br>sons of Vitahavya once more invaded his dominions and defeated him in<br>battle. Having vanquished king Sudeva thus, the victors returned to their<br>own city. After that Divodasa, the son of Sudeva, became installed on the<br>throne of Kasi as its ruler. Realising the prowess of those high-souled<br>princes, viz., the sons of Vitahavya, king Divodasa, endued with great<br>energy, rebuilt and fortified the city of Baranasi at the command of<br>Indra. The territories of Divodasa were full of Brahmanas and Kshatriyas,<br>and abounded with Vaisyas and Sudras. And they teemed with articles and<br>provisions of every kind, and were adorned with shops and marts swelling<br>with prosperity. Those territories, O best of kings, stretched northwards<br>from the banks of Ganga to the southern banks of Gomati, and resembled a<br>second Amravati (the city of Indra). The Haihayas once again, O Bharata,<br>attacked that tiger among kings, as he ruled his kingdom. The mighty king<br>Divodasa endued with great splendour, issuing out of his capital, gave<br>them battle. The engagement between the two parties proved so fierce as<br>to resemble the encounter in days of old between the deities and the<br>Asuras. King Divodasa fought the enemy for a thousand days at the end of<br>which, having lost a number of followers and animals, he became<br>exceedingly distressed.[250] King Divodasa, O monarch, having lost his<br>army and seeing his treasury exhausted, left his capital and fled away.<br>Repairing to the delightful retreat of Bhardwaja endued with great wisdom<br>the king, O chastiser of foes joining his hands in reverence, sought the<br>Rishi's protection. Beholding King Divodasa before him, the eldest son of<br>Vrihaspati, viz., Bharadwaja of excellent conduct, who was the monarch's<br>priest, said unto him, What is the reason of thy coming here? Tell me<br>everything, O king. I shall do that which is agreeable to thee, without<br>any scruple.'<br><br>"The king said, 'O holy one, the sons of Vitahavya have slain all the<br>children and men of my house. I only have escaped with life, totally<br>discomfited by the foe. I seek thy protection. It behoveth thee, O holy<br>one, to protect me with such affection as thou hast for a disciple. Those<br>princes of sinful deeds have slaughtered my whole race, leaving myself<br>only alive.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Unto him who pleaded so piteously, Bharadwaja of<br>great energy said, Do not fear! Do not fear! O son of Sudeva, let thy<br>fears be dispelled. I shall perform a sacrifice, O monarch, in order that<br>thou mayst have a son through whom thou shalt be able to smite thousands<br>upon thousands of Vitahavya's party. After this, the Rishi performed a<br>sacrifice with the object of bestowing a son on Divodasa. As the result<br>thereof, unto Divodasa was born a son named Pratarddana. Immediately on<br>his birth he grew up like a boy of full three and ten years and quickly<br>mastered the entire Vedas and the whole of arms. Aided by his Yoga<br>powers, Bharadwaja of great intelligence had entered into the prince.<br>Indeed, collecting all the energy that occurs in the object of the<br>universe, Bharadwaja put them together in the body of prince Pratarddana.<br>Put on shining mail on his person and armed with the bow, Pratarddana,<br>his praises sung by bards and the celestial Rishis, shone resplendent<br>like the risen star of day. Mounted on his car and with the scimitar tied<br>to his belt, he shone like a blazing fire. With scimitar and shield and<br>whirling his shield as he went, he proceeded to the presence of his sire.<br>Beholding the prince, the son of Sudeva, viz., king Divodasa, became<br>filled with joy. Indeed, the old king thought the sons of his enemy<br>Vitahavya as already slain. Divodasa then installed his son Pratarddana<br>as Yuvaraja, and regarding himself crowned with success became<br>exceedingly happy. After this, the old king commanded that chastiser of<br>foes, viz., prince Pratarddana to march against the sons of Vitahavya and<br>slay them in battle. Endued with great powers. Pratarddana, that<br>subjugator of hostile cities speedily crossed Ganga on his car and<br>proceeded against the city of the Vitahavyas. Hearing the clatter<br>produced by the wheels of his car, the sons of Vitahavya, riding on their<br>own cars that looked like fortified citadels and that were capable of<br>destroying hostile vehicles, issued out of their city. Issuing out of<br>their capital, those tigers among men, viz., the sons of Vitahavya, who<br>were all skilful warriors cased in mail, rushed with uplifted weapons<br>towards Pratarddana, covering him with showers of arrows. Encompassing<br>him with innumerable cars, O Yudhisthira, the Vitahavyas poured upon<br>Pratarddana showers of weapons of various kinds like clouds pouring<br>torrents of rain on the breast of Himavat. Baffling their weapons with<br>his own, prince Pratarddana endued with mighty energy slew them all with<br>his shafts that resembled the lighting fire of Indra. Their heads struck<br>off, O king, with hundreds and thousands of broad-headed arrows, the<br>warriors of Vitahavya fell down with blood-dyed bodies like Kinsuka trees<br>felled by woodmen with their axes on every side. After all his warriors<br>and sons had fallen in battle, king Vitahavya fled away from his capital<br>to the retreat of Bhrigu. Indeed, arrived there, the royal fugitive<br>sought the protection of Bhrigu. The Rishi Bhrigu, O monarch, assured the<br>defeated king of his protection. Pratarddana followed in the footsteps of<br>Vitahavya. Arrived at the Rishi's retreat, the son of Divodasa said in a<br>loud voice.&#8212;Ho, listen ye disciples of the high souled Bhrigu that may<br>happen to be present, I wish to see the sage. Go and inform him of this.<br>Recognising that it was Pratarddana who had come, the Rishi Bhrigu<br>himself came out of his retreat and worshipped that best of kings<br>according to due rites. Addressing him then, the Rishi said,&#8212;Tell me, O<br>king, what is thy business. The king, at this, informed the Rishi of the<br>reason of his presence.'<br><br>"The king said, 'King Vitahavya has come here, O Brahmana. Do thou give<br>him up. His sons, O Brahmana, had destroyed my race. They had laid waste<br>the territories and the wealth of the kingdom of Kasi. Hundred sons,<br>however, of this king proud of his might, have all been slain by me. By<br>slaying that king himself I shall today pay off the debt I owe to my<br>father. Unto him that foremost of righteous men, viz., the Rishi Bhrigu,<br>penetrated with compassion, replied by saying,&#8212;There is no Kshatriya in<br>this retreat. They that are here are all Brahmanas. Hearing these words<br>of Bhrigu that must accord he thought with truth, Pratarddana touched the<br>Rishi's feet slowly and, filled with delight, said,&#8212;By this, O holy one,<br>I am without doubt, crowned with success, since this king becomes<br>abandoned by the very order of his birth in consequence of my prowess.<br>Give me thy permission, O Brahmana, to leave thee, and let me solicit<br>thee to pray for my welfare. This king, O founder of the race that goes<br>by the name, has been compelled to leave of the very community of his<br>birth, in consequence of my might. Dismissed by the Rishi Bhrigu, king<br>Pratarddana then departed from that retreat, having even as a snake<br>vomits forth its real poison and repaired to the place he had come from.<br>Meanwhile, king Vitahavya attained to the status of a Brahmana sage by<br>virtue of the words only of Bhrigu. And he acquired also a complete<br>mastery over all the Vedas through the same cause. Vitahavya had a son<br>named Gritsamada who in beauty of person was a second Indra. Once on a<br>time the Daityas afflicted him much, believing him to be none else than<br>Indra. With regard to that high-souled Rishi, one foremost of Srutis in<br>the Richs goes like this viz., He with whom Gritsamada stays, O Brahmana,<br>is held in high respect by all Brahmanas. Endued with great intelligence,<br>Gritsamada become a regenerate Rishi in the observance of Brahmacharyya.<br>Gritsamada had a regenerate son of the name of Sutejas. Sutejas had a son<br>of the name of Varchas, and the son of Varchas was known by the name of<br>Vihavya. Vihavya had a son of his loins who was named Vitatya and Vitatya<br>had a son of name Satya. Satya had a son of name Santa. Santa had a son,<br>viz., the Rishi Sravas. Sravas begot a son named Tama. Tama begot a son<br>named Prakasa, who was a very superior Brahmana. Prakasa had a son named<br>Vagindra who was the foremost of all silent reciters of sacred Mantras.<br>Vagindra begot a son named Pramati who was a complete master of all the<br>Vedas and their branches. Pramati begot upon the Apsara Ghritachi a son<br>who was named Ruru. Ruru begot a son upon his spouse Pramadvara. That son<br>was the regenerate Rishi Sunaka. Sunaka begot a son who is named Saunaka.<br>It was even thus, O foremost of monarchs, that king Vitahavya, though a<br>Kshatriya by the order of his birth, obtained the status of a Brahmana, O<br>chief of Kshatriyas, through the grace of Bhrigu. I have also told thee<br>the genealogy of the race that sprung from Gritsamada. What else wouldst<br>thou ask?'
