                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou always worshippest, O king, Brahmanas of<br>praiseworthy, vows. Whatever, however is that fruit seeing which thou<br>worshippest them, O king? O thou of high vows, beholding what prosperity<br>attaching to the worship of the Brahmanas dost thou worship them? Tell me<br>all this, O thou of mighty arms!<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Here is Kesava endued with great intelligence. He will<br>tell thee everything. Of high vows and endued with prosperity, even he<br>will tell you what the prosperity is that attaches to the worship of<br>Brahmanas. My strength, ears, speech, mind, eyes, and that clear<br>understanding of mine (are all clouded today). I think, the time is not<br>distant when I shall have to cast off my body. The sun seems to me to go<br>very slowly.[611] Those high duties, O king, that are mentioned in the<br>Puranas as observed by Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras,<br>have all been recited by me. Do thou, O son of Pritha, learn from Krishna<br>what little remains to be learnt on that head. I know Krishna truly. I<br>know who he is and what his ancient might is. O chief of the Kauravas,<br>Kesava is of immeasurable soul. Whenever doubts arise, it is he who<br>upholds Righteousness then.[612] It is Krishna who created the earth, and<br>sky, and the heavens. Indeed, the earth has sprung from Krishna's body.<br>Of terrible prowess and existing from the beginning of time, it is<br>Krishna who became the mighty Boar and raised the submerged Earth. It is<br>He who created all the points of the compass, together with all the<br>mountains. Below Him are the welkin, heaven, the four cardinal points,<br>and the four subsidiary points. It is from him that the entire creation<br>has flowed. It is He who has created this ancient universe. In His navel<br>appeared a Lotus. Within that Lotus sprang Brahma himself of immeasurable<br>energy. It was Brahma, O son of Pritha, who rent that darkness which<br>existed surpassing the very ocean (in depth and extent). In the Treta<br>age, O Partha, Krishna existed (on the earth), in the form of<br>Righteousness. In the Treta age, he existed in the form of Knowledge. In<br>the Dwapara age, he existed in the form of might. In the Kali age he came<br>to the earth in the form of unrighteousness. It is He who in days of yore<br>slew the Daityas. It is He who is the Ancient God. It is He who ruled the<br>Asuras in the form of their Emperor (Valin). It is He who is the Creator<br>of all beings. It is He who is also the future of all created Beings. It<br>is He who is also the protector of this universe fraught with the seed of<br>destruction. When the cause of Righteousness languishes, this Krishna<br>takes birth in the race of either the gods or among men. Staying on<br>Righteousness, this Krishna of cleansed soul (on such occasion) protects<br>both the higher and the lower worlds. Sparing those that deserve to be<br>spared, Krishna sets himself to the slaughter of the Asura, O Partha! It<br>is he who is all acts proper and improper and it is he who is the cause.<br>It is Krishna who is the act done, the act to be done, and the act that<br>is being done. Know that that illustrious one is Rahu and Soma and Sakra.<br>It is he that is Viswakarma. It is he that is of universal form. He is<br>the destroyer and he is the Creator of the universe. He is the wielder of<br>the Sula (lance); He is of human form; and He is of terrible form. All<br>creatures sing his praises, for he is known by his acts. Hundreds of<br>Gandharvas and Apsaras and deities always accompany him. The very<br>Rakshasas hymn his praise. He is the Enhancer of Wealth; He is the one<br>victorious Being in the universe. In Sacrifices, eloquent men hymn His<br>praises. The singers of Samans praise Him by reciting the Rathantaras.<br>The Brahmanas praise Him with Vedic Mantras. It is unto Him that the<br>sacrificial priests pour their libations. The deities with Indra at their<br>head hymned His praise when He lifted up the Gobardhana mountains for<br>protecting the cow-herds of Brindavana against the incessant showers that<br>Indra poured in rage. He is, O Bharata, the one Blessing unto all<br>creatures. He, O Bharata, having entered the old Brahma cave, beheld from<br>that place the original cover of the world in the beginning of Time.[613]<br>Agitating all the Danavas and the Asuras, this Krishna of foremost feats<br>rescued the earth. It is unto Him that people dedicate diverse kinds of<br>food. It is unto Him that the warriors dedicate all kinds of their<br>vehicles at the time of war. He is eternal, and it is under that<br>illustrious one that the welkin, earth, heaven, all things exist and<br>stay. He it is who has caused the vital seed of the gods Mitra and Varuna<br>to fall within a jar, whence sprang the Rishi known by the name of<br>Vasishtha. It is Krishna who is the god of wind; it is He who is the<br>puissant Aswins; it is He who is that first of gods, viz., the sun<br>possessed of a thousand rays. It is He by whom the Asuras have been<br>subjugated. It is He who covered the three worlds with three steps of<br>His. He is the soul of the deities and human beings, and Pitris. It is He<br>who is the Sacrifice performed by those persons that are conversant with<br>the rituals of sacrifices. It is He who rises every day in the firmament<br>(in the form of the sun) and divides Time into day and night, and courses<br>for half the year northwards and for half the year southwards.<br>Innumerable rays of light emanate from Him upwards and downwards and<br>transversely and illumine the earth. Brahmanas conversant with the Vedas<br>adore Him. Taking a portion of His rays the sun shines in the firmament.<br>Month after month, the sacrificer ordains Him as a sacrifice. Regenerate<br>persons conversant with the Vedas sing His praises in sacrifices of all<br>kinds. He it is that constitutes the wheel of the year, having three<br>naves and seven horses to drag it. It is in this way that He supports the<br>triple mansion (of the seasons), Endued with great energy, pervading all<br>things, the foremost of all creatures, it is Krishna who alone upholds<br>all the worlds. He is the sun, the dispeller of all darkness. He is the<br>Creator of all. Do thou, O hero, approach that Krishna! Once on a time,<br>the high-souled and puissant Krishna dwelt, for a while, in the form of<br>Agni in the forest of Khandava among some straw or dry grass. Soon was He<br>gratified (for he consumed all the medicinal herbs in that forest).<br>Capable of going everywhere at will, it was Krishna who, having<br>subjugated the Rakshasas and Uragas, poured them as libations upon the<br>blazing fire. It is Krishna who gave unto Arjuna a number of white<br>steeds. It is He who is the creator of all steeds. This world (or, human<br>life) represents his car. He it is that yokes that car for setting it in<br>motion. That car has three wheels (viz., the three attributes of Sattwa,<br>Rajas, and Tamas). It has three kinds of motion (for it goes upwards or<br>downwards or transversely, implying superior, inferior, and intermediate<br>birth as brought about by acts). It has four horses yoked to it (viz.,<br>Time, Predestiny, the will of the deities, and one's own will). It has<br>three naves (white, black, and mixed, implying good acts, evil acts and<br>acts that are of a mixed character). It is this Krishna who is the refuge<br>of the five original elements with the sky among them. It is He who<br>created the earth and heaven and the space between. Indeed, it is this<br>Krishna of immeasurable and blazing energy who has created the forests<br>and the mountains. It is this Krishna who, desirous of chastising Sakra<br>who was about to hurl his thunder at him, crossed the rivers and once<br>paralysed him. He is the one great Indra that is adored by the Brahmanas<br>in great sacrifices with the aid of a thousand old Riks. It was this<br>Krishna, O king, who alone was able to keep the Rishi Durvasa of great<br>energy as a guest for some time in his house. He is said to be the one<br>ancient Rishi. He is the Creator of the universe. Indeed, He creates<br>everything from His own nature. Superior to all two deities it is He who<br>teaches all the deities. He scrupulously observes all ancient ordinances.<br>Know, O king, that this Krishna, who is called Vishwaksena, is the fruit<br>of all acts that relate to pleasure, of all acts that are founded on the<br>Vedas, and of all acts that appertain to the world. He is the white rays<br>of light that are seen in all the worlds. He is the three worlds. He is<br>the three Regents of all the worlds. He is the three sacrificial fires.<br>He is the three Vyahritis; indeed, this son of Devaki is all the gods<br>together. He is the year; He is the Seasons; He is the Fortnights; He is<br>the Day and the Night; He is those divisions of time which are called<br>Kalas, and Kashthas, and Matras, and Muhurtas, and Lavas, and Kshanas.<br>Know that this Vishwaksena is all these. The Moon and the Sun, the<br>Planets, the Constellations, and the Stars, all the Parva days, including<br>the day of the full moon, the conjunctions of the constellations and the<br>seasons, have, O son of Pritha, flowed from this Krishna who is<br>Vishwaksena. The Rudras, the Adityas, the Vasus, the Aswins, the Sadhyas,<br>the Viswedevas, the diverse Maruts, Prajapati himself, the mother of the<br>deities, viz., Aditi, and the seven Rishis, have all sprung from Krishna.<br>Transforming Himself into the Wind, He scatters the universe. Of<br>Universal form, He becomes Fire that burns all things. Changing Himself<br>into Water, He drenches and submerges all, and assuming the form of<br>Brahman, He creates all the diverse tribes of animate and inanimate<br>creatures. He is Himself the Veda, yet he learns all the Vedas. He is<br>Himself all the ordinances, yet He observes all the ordinances that have<br>been laid down in matters connected with Righteousness and the Vedas and<br>that force or might which rules the world. Indeed, know, O Yudhishthira,<br>that this Kesava is all the mobile and immobile universe. He is of the<br>form of the most resplendent light. Of universal form, this Krishna is<br>displayed in that blazing effulgence. The original cause of the soul of<br>all existent creatures, He at first created the waters. Afterwards He<br>created this universe. Know that this Krishna is Vishnu. Know that He is<br>the soul of the universe. Know that He is all the seasons; He is these<br>diverse wonderful vegetations of Nature which we see; He is the clouds<br>that pour rain and the lightening that flashes in the sky. He is the<br>elephant Airavata. In fact, He is all the immobile and mobile universe.<br>The abode of the universe and transcending all attributes, this Krishna<br>is Vasudeva. When He becomes Jiva He comes to be called Sankarshana.<br>Next, He transforms Himself into Pradyumna and then into Aniruddha. In<br>this way, the high-souled Krishna, who has Himself for His origin divides<br>(or displays) Himself in fourfold form. Desirous of creating this<br>universe which consists of the fivefold primal elements. He sets himself<br>to his task, and causes it to go on in the fivefold form of animate<br>existence consisting of deities and Asuras and human beings and beasts<br>and birds. He it is that then creates the Earth and the Wind, the Sky,<br>Light, and also Water, O son of Pritha! Having created this universe of<br>immobile and mobile objects distributed into four orders of being (viz.,<br>viviparous, oviparous, vegetable and filth-born), he then created the<br>earth with her fivefold seed. He then created the firmament for pouring<br>copious showers of water on the earth.[614] Without doubt, O king, it is<br>this Krishna who has created this universe. His origin is in his own<br>self; it is He who causes all things to exist through his own puissance.<br>He it is that has created the deities, the Asuras, the human beings, the<br>world, the Rishis, the Pitris, and all creatures. Desirous of creating,<br>that Lord of all creatures duly created the whole universe of life. Know<br>that good and evil, mobile and immobile, have all flowed from this One<br>who is Vishwaksena. Whatever exists, and whatever will spring into<br>existence, all is Kesava. This Krishna is also the death that overtakes<br>all creatures when their end comes. He is eternal and it is He who<br>upholds the cause of Righteousness. Whatever existed in the past, and<br>whatever we do not know, verily, all that also is this Vishwaksena.<br>Whatever is noble and meritorious in the universe, indeed, whatever of<br>good and of evil exists, all that is Kesava who is inconceivable. Hence,<br>it is absurd to think of anything that is superior to Kesava. Kesava is<br>even such. More than this, He is Narayana, the highest of the high,<br>immutable and unfading. He is the eternal and immutable cause of the<br>entire mobile and immobile universe with its beginning, middle, and end,<br>as also of all creatures whose birth follows their wish.'"
