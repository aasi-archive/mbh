                            "Uma said, 'Forest recluses reside in delightful regions, among the<br>springs and fountains of rivers, in bowers by the sides of streams and<br>rills, on hills and mountains, in woods and forests, and in sacred spots<br>full of fruits and roots. With concentrated attention and observant of<br>vows and rules, they dwell in such places. I desire, O Sankara, to hear<br>the sacred ordinances which they follow. These recluses, O god of all<br>gods, are persons that depend, for the protection of their bodies, upon<br>themselves alone.'[565]<br><br>Maheswara said, 'Do thou hear with concentrated attention what the duties<br>are of forest recluses. Having listened to them with one mind, O goddess,<br>do thou set thy heart upon righteousness. Listen then to what the acts<br>are that should be practised by righteous recluses crowned with success,<br>observant of rigid vows and rules, and residing in woods and forests.<br>Performing ablutions thrice a day, worshipping the Pitris and the<br>deities, pouring libations on the sacred fire, performing those<br>sacrifices and rites that go by the name of Ishti-homa, picking up the<br>grains of Nivara-paddy, eating fruit and roots, and using oil that is<br>pressed out from Inguda and castor-seeds are their duties. Having gone<br>through the practices of Yoga and become crowned with (ascetic) success<br>and freed from lust and wrath, they should seat themselves in the<br>attitude called Virasana. Indeed, they should reside in those places<br>which are inaccessible to cowards.[566] Observant of the excellent<br>ordinances relating to Yoga, sitting in summer in the midst of four fires<br>on four sides with the sun overhead, duly practising what is called<br>Manduka Yoga, and always seated in the attitude called Virasana, and<br>lying on bare rocks or the earth, these men, with hearts set upon<br>righteousness, must expose themselves to cold and water and fire. They<br>subsist upon water or air or moss. They use two pieces of stones only for<br>husking their corn. Some of them use their teeth only for such a purpose.<br>They do not keep utensils of any kind (for storing anything for the day<br>to come). Some of them clothe themselves with rags and barks of trees or<br>deer-skins. Even thus do they pass their lives for the measure of time<br>allotted to them, according to the ordinances (set forth in the<br>scriptures). Remaining in woods and forests, they wander within woods and<br>forests, live within them, and are always to be found within them.<br>Indeed, these forest recluses entering into woods and forests live within<br>them as disciples, obtaining a preceptor, live with him. The performance<br>of the rites of Homa is their duty, as also the observance of the five<br>sacrifices. A due observance of the rules about distribution (in respect<br>of time) of the fivefold sacrifices as laid down in the Vedas, devotion<br>to (other) sacrifices, forming the eighth, observance of the Chaturmasya,<br>performance of the Paurnamasya, and other sacrifices, and performance of<br>the daily sacrifices, are the duties of these men dissociated from wives,<br>freed from every attachment, and cleansed from every sin. Indeed, they<br>should live even thus in the forest. The sacrificial ladle and the<br>water-vessel are their chief wealth. They are always devoted to the three<br>fires. Righteous in their conduct and adhering to the path of virtue,<br>they attain to the highest end. These Munis, crowned with (ascetic)<br>success and ever devoted to the religion of Truth, attain to the highly<br>sacred region of Brahman or the eternal region of Soma. O auspicious<br>goddess, I have thus recited to thee, in brief, the outlines of the<br>religion that is followed by forest recluses and that has many practices<br>in detail.'<br><br>"Uma said, 'O holy one, O lord of all creatures, O thou that art<br>worshipped by all beings, I desire to hear what the religion is of those<br>Munis that are followers of the scriptures treating of ascetic success.<br>Do thou recite it to me. Residing in woods and forests and<br>well-accomplished in the scriptures of success, some amongst them live<br>and act as they like, without being restrained by particular practices;<br>others have wives. How, indeed, have their practices been laid down?'<br><br>"Mahadeva said, 'O goddess, the shaving of the head and the wearing of<br>the brown robes are the indications of those recluses that rove about in<br>freedom; while the indications of those that sport with wedded wives<br>consist in passing their nights at home. Performing ablutions there times<br>a day is the duty of the classes, while the Homa, with water and fruits<br>from the wilderness, belongs to the wedded recluses as performed by the<br>Rishis in general. Absorption, Yoga-meditation, and adherence to those<br>duties that constitute piety and that have been laid down as such (in the<br>scriptures and the Vedas) are some of the other duties prescribed for<br>them. All those duties also of which I have spoken to thee before as<br>appertaining to recluses residing in forests, are the duties of these<br>also. Indeed, if those duties are observed, they that observe them,<br>attain to the rewards that attach to severe penances. Those forest<br>recluses that lead wedded lives should confine the gratification of their<br>senses to these wedded wives of theirs. By indulging in sexual congress<br>with their wives at only those times when their seasons come, they<br>conform to the duties that have been laid down for them. The religion<br>which these virtuous men are to follow is the religion that has been laid<br>down and followed by the Rishis. With their eyes set upon the acquisition<br>of righteousness, they should never pursue any other object of desire<br>from a sense of unrestrained caprice. That man who makes the gift unto<br>all creatures of an assurance of perfect harmlessness or innocence, freed<br>as his soul becomes from the stain of malice or harmfulness, becomes<br>endued with righteousness. Verily, that person who shows compassion to<br>all creatures, who adopts as a vow a behaviour of perfect sincerity<br>towards al creatures, and who constitutes himself the soul of all<br>creatures, becomes endued with righteousness. A bath in all the Vedas,<br>and a behaviour of sincerity towards all creatures, are looked upon as<br>equal in point of merit; or, perhaps, the latter is a little<br>distinguished above the other in point of merit. Sincerity, it has been<br>said, is Righteousness; while insincerity or crookedness is the reverse.<br>That man who conducts himself with sincerity becomes endued with<br>Righteousness. The man who is always devoted to sincerity of behaviour,<br>succeeds in attaining to a residence among the deities. Hence, he who<br>wishes to achieve the merit of righteousness should become endued with<br>sincerity. Possessed of a forgiving disposition and of self-restraint,<br>and with wrath under complete subjection, one should transform oneself<br>into an embodiment of Righteousness and become freed from malice. Such a<br>man, who becomes devoted, besides, to the discharge of all the duties<br>Religion, becomes endued with the merit of Righteousness. Freed from<br>drowsiness and procrastination, the pious person, who adheres to the path<br>of Righteousness to the best of his power, and becomes possessed of pure<br>conduct, and who is venerable in years, comes to be regarded as equal to<br>Brahma himself.'<br><br>"Uma said. By what course of duties, O god, do those ascetics who are<br>attached to their respective retreats and possessed of wealth of<br>penances, succeed in becoming endued with great splendour? By what acts<br>again, do kings and princes who are possessed of great wealth, and others<br>who are destitute of wealth, succeed in obtaining high rewards? By what<br>acts, O god, do denizens of the forest succeed in attaining to that place<br>which is eternal and in adorning their persons with celestial<br>sandal-paste? O illustrious god of three eyes, O destroyer of the triple<br>city, do thou dispel this doubt of mine connected with the auspicious<br>subject of the observance of penances by telling everything in detail.'<br><br>"The illustrious deity said, 'Those who observe the vows relating to<br>fasts and restrain their senses, who abstain from injury of any kind to<br>any creature, and who practise truthfulness of speech, attain to success<br>and ascending to Heaven sport in felicity with the Gandharvas as their<br>companions, freed from every kind of evil. The righteous souled man who<br>lies down in the attitude which appertains to Manduka-Yoga, and who<br>properly and according to the ordinance performs meritorious acts after<br>having taken the Diksha, sports in felicity in the next world in the<br>company of the Nagas. That man who lives in the company of deer and<br>subsists upon such grass and vegetables as fall off from their mouths,<br>and who has undergone the Diksha and attends to the duties attached to<br>it, succeeds in attaining to Amaravati (the mansions of Indra). That man<br>who subsists upon the moss he gathers and the fallen leaves of trees that<br>he picks up, and endures all the severities of cold, attains to very high<br>place. That man who subsists upon either air or water, or fruits and<br>roots, attains in after life to the affluence that belongs to the Yakshas<br>and sports in felicity in the company of diverse tribes of Apsaras.<br>Having practised for two and ten years, according to the rites laid down<br>in the ordinances, the vow relating to the endurance of the five fires in<br>the summer season, one becomes in one's next life a king. That man who,<br>having observed vows with respect to food, practises penances for two and<br>twelve years, carefully abstaining from all interdicted food, taken at<br>forbidden hours, during the periods becomes in his next life a ruler of<br>earth.[567] That man who sits and lies on the bare ground with the cope<br>of the firmament alone for his shelter, observes the course of duties<br>that attach to Diksha, and then casts off his body by abstaining from all<br>food, attains to great felicity in Heaven. The rewards of one who sits<br>and lies down upon the bare ground (with the welkin alone for his<br>shelter) are said to be excellent vehicles and beds, and costly mansions<br>possessed of the resplendence of the moon, O lady! That man who, having<br>subsisted upon abstemious diet and observed diverse excellent vows, lives<br>depending upon his own self and then casts off his body by abstaining<br>from all food, succeeds in ascending to heaven and enjoying all its<br>felicity. That man who, having lived in entire dependence upon his own<br>self, observes for two and ten years the duties that appertain to Diksha,<br>and at last casts off his body on the great ocean, succeeds in attaining<br>to the regions of Varuna after death. That man who, living in entire<br>dependence upon his own self observes the duties that attach to Diksha<br>for two and ten years, and pierces his own feet with a sharp stone,<br>attains to the felicity of the region that belongs to the Guhyakas. He<br>who cultivates self with the aid of self, who frees himself from the<br>influence of all pairs of opposites (such as heat and cold, joy and<br>sorrow, etc), who is freed from every kind of attachment, and who<br>mentally observes for two and ten years such a course of conduct after<br>Diksha, attains to Heaven and enjoys every happiness with the deities as<br>his companions. He who lives in entire dependence upon his own self and<br>observes for two and ten years the duties that attach to Diksha and<br>finally casts off his body on the fire as an oblation to the deities,<br>attains to the regions of Brahman and is held in high respect there. That<br>regenerate man, O goddess, who having properly gone through the Diksha<br>keeps his senses under subjugation, and placing his Self on Self frees<br>himself from the sense of meum, desirous of achieving righteousness, and<br>sets out, without a covering for his body, after the due observance of<br>the duties of Diksha for two and ten years and after having placed his<br>sacred fire on a tree, and walks along the path that belongs to heroes<br>and lies down (when need for lying down comes) in the attitude of heroes,<br>and conducts himself always after the manner of heroes, certainly attains<br>to the end that is reserved for heroes.[568] Such a man repairs to the<br>eternal region of Sakra where he becomes crowned with the fruition of all<br>his wishes and where he sports in joy, his person decked with garlands of<br>celestial flowers and celestial perfumes. Indeed, that righteous souled<br>person lives happily in Heaven, with the deities as his companions. The<br>hero, observant of the practices of heroes and devoted to that Yoga which<br>belongs to heroes, living in the practice of Goodness, having renounced<br>everything, having undergone the Diksha and subjugated his senses, and<br>observing purity of both body and mind, is sure to attain to that path<br>which is reserved for heroes. Eternal regions of happiness are his.<br>Riding on a car that moves at the will of the rider, he roves through all<br>those happy regions as he likes. Indeed, dwelling in the region of Sakra,<br>that blessed person always sports in joy, freed from every calamity."
