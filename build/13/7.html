                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O the best of Bharata's race and the foremost of<br>great men, I wish to know what the fruits are of good deed. Do thou<br>enlighten me on this point.'"<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall tell thee what thou hast asked. Do thou, O<br>Yudhishthira, listen to this which constitutes the secret knowledge of<br>the Rishis. Listen to me as I explain what the ends, long coveted, are<br>which are attained by men after death. Whatever actions are performed by<br>particular corporeal beings, the fruits thereof are reaped by the doers<br>while endued with similar corporeal bodies; for example, the fruits of<br>actions done with mind are enjoyed at the time of dreams, and those of<br>actions performed physically are enjoyed in the working state physically.<br>In whatever states creatures perform good or evil deeds, they reap the<br>fruits thereof in similar states of succeeding lives. No act done with<br>the aid of the five organs of sensual perception, is ever lost. The five<br>sensual organs and the immortal soul which is the sixth, remain its<br>witnesses. One should devote one's eye to the service of the guest and<br>should devote one's heart on the same; one should utter words that are<br>agreeable; one should also follow and worship (one's guest). This is<br>called Panchadakshin Sacrifice, (the sacrifice with five gifts). He who<br>offers good food to the unknown and weary travellers fatigued by a long<br>journey, attains to great merit. Those that use the sacrificial platform<br>as their only bed obtain commodious mansions and beds (in subsequent<br>births). Those that wear only rags and barks of trees for dress, obtain<br>good apparel and ornaments in next birth. One possessed of penances and<br>having his soul on Yoga, get vehicles and riding animals (as the fruit of<br>their renunciation in this life). The monarch that lies down by the side<br>of the sacrificial fire, attains to vigour and valour. The man who<br>renounces the enjoyment of all delicacies, attains to prosperity, and he<br>that abstains from animal food, obtains children and cattle, He who lies<br>down with his head downwards, or who lives in water, or who lives<br>secluded and alone in the practice of Brahmacharya, attains to all the<br>desired ends. He who offers shelter to a guest and welcomes him with<br>water to wash his feet as also with food, light and bed, attains to the<br>merits of the sacrifice with the five gifts. He who lays himself down on<br>a warrior's bed on the battle-field in the posture of a warrior, goes to<br>those eternal regions where all the objects of desire are fulfilled. A<br>man, O king, attains to riches that makes charitable gifts. One secures<br>obedience to one's command by the vow of silence, all the enjoyments of<br>life by practice of austerities, long life by Brahmacharya, and beauty,<br>prosperity and freedom from disease by abstaining from injury to others.<br>Sovereignty falls to the lot of those that subsist on fruits and roots<br>only. Residence in heaven is attained by those that live on only leaves<br>of trees. A man, O king, is said to obtain happiness, by abstention from<br>food. By confining one's diet to herbs alone, one becomes possessed of<br>cows. By living on grass one attains to the celestial regions. By<br>foregoing all intercourse with one's wife and making ablutions three<br>times during the day and by inhaling the air only for purposes of<br>subsistence, one obtains the merit of a sacrifice. Heaven is attained by<br>the practice of truth, nobility of birth by sacrifices. The Brahmana of<br>pure practices that subsists on water only, and performs the Agnihotra<br>ceaselessly, and recites the Gayatri, obtains a kingdom. By abstaining<br>food or by regulating it, one attains to residence in heaven. O king, by<br>abstaining from all but the prescribed diet while engaged in sacrifices,<br>and by making pilgrimage for twelve years, one attains to a place better<br>than the abodes reserved for heroes. By reading all the Vedas, one is<br>instantly liberated from misery, and by practising virtue in thought, one<br>attains to the heavenly regions. That man who is able to renounce that<br>intense yearning of the heart for happiness and material enjoyments,&#8212;a<br>yearning that is difficult of conquest by the foolish and that doth not<br>abate with the abatement of bodily vigour and that clings like a fatal<br>disease unto him,&#8212;is able to secure happiness. As the young calf is able<br>to recognise its dam from among a thousand cows, so does the previous<br>acts of a man pursue him (in all his different transformations). As the<br>flowers and fruits of a tree, unurged by visible influences, never miss<br>their proper season, so does Karma done in a previous existence bring<br>about its fruits in proper time. With age, man's hair grows grey, his<br>teeth become loose; his eyes and ears too become dim in action; but the<br>only thing that does not abate is his desire for enjoyments. Prajapati is<br>pleased with those acts that please one's father, and the Earth is<br>pleased with those acts that please one's mother, and Brahma is adored<br>with those acts that please one's preceptor. Virtue is honoured by him<br>who honours these three. The acts of those that despise these three do<br>not avail them.'"<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'The princes of Kuru's race became filled with wonder<br>upon listening to this speech of Bhishma. All of them became pleased in<br>mind and overpowered with joy. As Mantras applied with a desire to win<br>victory, or the performance of the Shoma sacrifice made without proper<br>gifts, or oblations poured on the fire without proper hymns, become<br>useless and lead to evil consequences, even so sin and evil results flow<br>from falsehood in speech. O prince, I have thus related to thee this<br>doctrine of the fruition of good and evil acts, as narrated by the Rishis<br>of old. What else dost thou wish to hear?"
