                            "Vibhavasu (otherwise called Surya) said, 'There are two offerings. One<br>of those consists of a palmful of water and the other called Akshata<br>consists of rice-grains with ghee. One should, on the day of the full<br>moon, stand facing that bright orb and make unto him the two offerings<br>mentioned, viz., a palmful of water and the rice-grains with ghee called<br>Akshata. The man who presents these offerings is said to adore his sacred<br>fire. Verily, he is regarded as one that has poured libations on the<br>three (principal) fires. That man of little understanding who cutteth<br>down a large tree on the day of the new moon, becomes stained with the<br>sin of Brahmanicide. By killing even a single leaf one incurs that sin.<br>That foolish man who chews a tooth-brush on the day of the new moon is<br>regarded as injuring the deity of the moon by such an act. The Pitris of<br>such a person become annoyed with him.[553] The deities do not accept the<br>libations poured by such a man on days of the full moon and the new moon.<br>His Pitris become enraged with him, and his race and the family become<br>extinct.'<br><br>"Sree said, 'That sinful house, in which eating and drinking vessels and<br>seats and beds lie scattered, and in which women are beaten, the deities<br>and Pitris leave in disgust. Verily, without accepting the offerings made<br>unto them by the owners of such houses, the deities and the Pitris fly<br>away from such a sinful habitation.'<br><br>"Angiras said, 'The offspring of that man increase who stands every night<br>for a full year under a Karanjaka tree with a lamp for lighting it, and<br>holds besides in his hand the roots of the Suvarchala plant.'[554]<br><br>"Gargya said, 'One should always do the duties of hospitality to one's<br>guests. One should give lamps in the hall or shed where sacrifices are<br>performed. One should avoid sleep during the day, and abstain from all<br>kinds of flesh or food. One should never injure kine and Brahmanas. One<br>should always recite names of the Pushkara lakes and the other sacred<br>waters. Such a course of duty, is the foremost. Even this constitutes a<br>high religion with its mysteries. If observed in practice, it is sure to<br>produce great consequences. If a person performs even a hundred<br>sacrifices, he is doomed to see the exhaustion of the merits attaching to<br>the libations poured therein. The duties, however, which I have mentioned<br>are such that when observed by a person endued with faith, their merit<br>becomes inexhaustible. Listen now to another high mystery concealed from<br>the view of many. The deities do not accept the libations (poured upon<br>the fire) on the occasion of Sraddhas and rites in their honour or on the<br>occasion of those rites that are performable on ordinary lunar days or on<br>the especially sacred days of the full moon and the new moon, if they<br>behold a woman in her season of impurity or one that is the daughter of a<br>mother afflicted with leprosy. The Pitris of the man who allows such a<br>woman to come near the place where the Sraddha is being performed by him,<br>do not become gratified with him for thirteen years. Robed in raiment of<br>white, and becoming pure in body and mind, one should invite Brahmanas<br>and cause them to utter their benedictions (when one performs the<br>Sraddha). On such occasions one should also recite the Bharata. It is by<br>observing all these that the offerings made at Sraddhas become<br>inexhaustible.'<br><br>"Dhaumya said, 'Broken utensils, broken bedsteads, cocks and, dogs, as<br>also such trees as have grown within the dwelling houses, are all<br>inauspicious objects. In a broken utensil is Kali himself, while in a<br>broken bedstead is loss of wealth. When a cock or a dog is in sight, the<br>deities do not eat the offerings made to them. Under the roots of a tree<br>scorpions and snakes undoubtedly find shelter. Hence, one should never<br>plant a tree within one's abode.'[555]<br><br>"Jamadagni said, 'That man whose heart is not pure is sure to go to Hell<br>even if he adores the deities in a Horse-sacrifice or in a hundred<br>Vajapeya sacrifices, or if he undergoes the severest austerities with<br>head downmost. Purity of heart is regarded as equal to sacrifices and<br>Truth. A very poor Brahmana, by giving only a Prastha of powdered barley<br>with a pure heart unto a Brahmana, attained to the region of Brahman<br>himself. This is a sufficient proof (of the importance of purity of<br>heart).'"
