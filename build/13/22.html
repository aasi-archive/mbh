                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Whom do the eternal Brahmanas strictly observing<br>religious rites call a proper object of gifts? Is a Brahmana that bears<br>the symbols of the order of life he follows to be regarded as such or one<br>who does not bear such indications is to be so regarded?'[202]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O monarch, it has been said that gifts should be made<br>unto a Brahmana that adheres to the duties of his own order, whether, he<br>bears the indications of a Brahmachari or not, for both are faultless,<br>viz., he that bears such indications and he that is divested of them.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'What fault does an uncleansed person incur, if he<br>makes gifts of sacrificial butter or food with great devotion unto<br>persons of the regenerate order?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Even one that is most destitute of self-restraint<br>becomes, without doubt, cleansed by devotion. Such a man, O thou of great<br>splendour, becomes cleansed in respect of every act (and not with<br>reference to gift alone).'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'It has been said that a Brahmana that is sought to<br>be employed in an act having reference to the deities, should never be<br>examined. The learned, however, say that with respect to such acts as<br>have reference to the Pitris, the Brahmana that is sought to be employed,<br>should be examined (in the matter of both his conduct and competence).'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'As regards acts that have reference to the deities, these<br>fructify not in consequence of the Brahmana that is employed in doing the<br>rites but through the grace of the deities themselves. Without doubt,<br>those persons that perform sacrifice obtain the merit attached to those<br>acts, through the grace of the deities.[203] The Brahmanas, O chief of<br>the Bharatas, are always devoted of Brahman. The Rishi Markandeya, one of<br>the greatest Rishis endued with intelligence in all the worlds, said this<br>in days of yore.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Why, O grandsire, are there five viz., he that is a<br>stranger, he that is endued with learning (connected with the duties of<br>his order), he that is connected by marriage, he that is endued with<br>penances, and he that adheres to the performance of sacrifices, regarded<br>as proper persons?'[204]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The first three, viz., strangers, relatives, and<br>ascetics, when possessed of these attributes, viz., purity of birth,<br>devotion to religious acts, learning, compassion, modesty, sincerity, and<br>truthfulness, are regarded as proper persons. The other two, viz., men of<br>learning and those devoted to sacrifices, when endued with five of these<br>attributes, viz., purity of birth, compassion, modesty, sincerity,<br>truthfulness, are also regarded as proper persons. Listen now to me, O<br>son of Pritha, as I recite to thee the opinions of these four persons of<br>mighty energy, viz., the goddess Earth, the Rishi Kasyapa, Agni (the<br>deity of fire) and the ascetic Markandeya.'<br><br>"The Earth said, 'As a clod of mud, when thrown into the great ocean<br>quickly dissolves away, even so every kind of sin disappears in the three<br>high attributes viz., officiation at sacrifices, teaching and receiving<br>of gifts.[205]<br><br>"Kasyapa said, 'The Vedas with their six branches, the Sankhya<br>philosophy, the Puranas, and high birth, these fail to rescue a<br>regenerate person if he falls away from good conduct.'[206]<br><br>"Agni said, 'That Brahmana who, engaged in study and regarding himself<br>learned, seeks with the aid of his learning to destroy the reputation of<br>others, falls away from righteousness, and comes to be regarded as<br>dissociated from truth. Verily regions of felicity herein-after are never<br>attained to by such a person of destructive genius.'<br><br>"Markandeya said, 'If a thousand Horse-sacrifices and Truth were weighed<br>in the balance, I do not know whether the former would weigh even half as<br>heavy as the latter.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Having spoken these words, those four persons, each<br>of whom is endued with immeasurable energy, viz., the goddess Earth,<br>Kasyapa, Agni, and Bhrigu's son armed with weapons, quickly went away.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'If Brahmanas observant of the vow of Brahmacharyya<br>in this world solicit the offerings one makes (unto one's deceased<br>ancestors in Sraddhas) I ask, can the Sraddha be regarded well-performed,<br>if the performer actually makes over those offerings unto such Brahmanas.<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'If, having practised the vow of Brahmacharyya for the<br>prescribed period (of twelve years) and acquired proficiency in the Vedas<br>and their branches, a Brahmana himself solicits the offering made in<br>Sraddhas and eats the same, he is regarded to fall away from his vow. The<br>Sraddha, however, is not regarded as stained in any way.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'The wise have said that duty of righteousness has<br>many ends and numerous doors. Tell me, O grandsire, what however are the<br>settled conclusions in this matter.'[207]<br><br>Bhishma said, 'Abstention from injury to others, truthfulness, the<br>absence of wrath (forgiveness), compassion, self-restraint, and sincerity<br>or candour, O monarch, are the indications of Righteousness. There are<br>persons who wander over the earth, praising righteousness but without<br>practising what they preach and engaged all the while in sin. O king, He<br>who gives unto such persons gold or gems or steeds, has to sink in hell<br>and to subsist there for ten years, eating the while the faeces of such<br>persons as live upon the flesh of dead kine and buffalos, of men called<br>Pukkasas, of others that live in the outskirts of cities and villages,<br>and of men that publish, under the influence of wrath and folly, the acts<br>and the ommissions of others.[208] Those foolish men who do give unto a<br>Brahmana observant of the vow of Brahmacharyya the offerings made in<br>Sraddhas (unto one's deceased ancestors), have to go, O monarch into<br>regions of great misery.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, what is superior to<br>Brahmacharyya? What is the highest indication of virtue? What is the<br>highest kind of purity?'<br><br>"Bhishma said,&#8212;'I tell thee, O son, that abstention from honey and meat<br>is even superior to Brahmacharyya. Righteousness consists in keeping<br>within boundaries or in self-restraint, the best indication of<br>Righteousness is Renunciation (which is also the highest kind of<br>purity).[209]<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'In what time should one practise Righteousness? In<br>what time should wealth be sought? In what time should pleasure be<br>enjoyed? O grandsire, do tell me this.'<br><br>"Bhishma said,&#8212;'One should earn wealth in the first part of one's life.<br>Then should one earn Righteousness, and then enjoy pleasure. One should<br>not, however, attach oneself to any of these. One should regard the<br>Brahmanas, worship one's preceptor and seniors, show compassion for all<br>creatures, be of mild disposition and agreeable speech. To utter<br>false-hood in a court of justice, to behave deceitfully towards the king,<br>to act falsely towards preceptors and seniors, are regarded as equivalent<br>(in heinousness) to Brahmanicide. One should never do an act of violence<br>to the king's person. Nor should one ever strike a cow. Both these<br>offences are equivalent to the sin of foeticide. One should never abandon<br>one's (homa) fire. One should also never cast off one's study of the<br>Vedas. One should never assail a Brahmana by words or acts. All these<br>offences are equivalent to Brahmanicide.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'What kind of Brahmanas should be regarded as good?<br>By making presents unto (what kind of) Brahmanas one may acquire great<br>merit? What kind of Brahmanas are they whom one should feed? Tell me all<br>this, O grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Those Brahmanas that are freed from wrath, that are<br>devoted to acts of righteousness, that are firm in Truth, and that<br>practise self-restraint are regarded as good. By making gifts unto them<br>one acquires great merit. One wins great merit by making presents unto<br>such Brahmanas as are free from pride, capable of bearing everything,<br>firm in the pursuit of their objects, endued with mastery over their<br>senses, devoted to the good of all creatures, and disposed to be friendly<br>towards all. One earns great merit by making gifts unto such Brahmanas as<br>are free from cupidity, as are pure of heart and conduct, possessed of<br>learning and modesty, truthful in speech and observant of their own<br>duties as laid down in the scriptures. The Rishis have declared that<br>Brahmana to be a deserving object of gifts who studies the four Vedas<br>with all their branches and is devoted to the six well-known duties (laid<br>down in the scriptures). One acquires great merit by making gifts unto<br>Brahmanas possessed of such qualifications. The man who makes gifts unto<br>a deserving Brahmana multiplies his merit a thousand-fold. A single<br>righteous Brahmana possessed of wisdom and Vedic lore, observant of the<br>duties laid down in the scriptures, distinguished by purity of behaviour,<br>is competent to rescue a whole race.[210] One should make gifts of kine<br>and horses and wealth and food and other kinds of articles unto a<br>Brahmana that is possessed of such qualifications. By making such gifts<br>unto such persons one earns great happiness in the next world. As I have<br>already told thee even one such Brahmana is fully competent to rescue the<br>entire race to which the giver belongs. What need I say, therefore, O<br>dear son, of the merit of making gifts unto many Brahmanas of such<br>qualifications? In making gifts, therefore one should always select the<br>object to whom the gifts are to be made. Hearing of a Brahmana possessed<br>of proper qualifications and regarded with respect by all good people,<br>one should invite him even if he resides at a distance and welcome him<br>when he arrives and one should worship him by all means in his power.'"
