                            "Yudhisthira said, 'I wish to know, O royal sage, whether any fault is<br>incurred by one who from interested or disinterested friendship imparts<br>instructions unto a person belonging to a low order of birth! O<br>grandsire, I desire to hear this, expounded to me in detail. The course<br>of duty is exceedingly subtile. Men are often seen to be stupefied in<br>respect of that course.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection, O king, I shall recite to thee, in<br>due order, what I heard certain Rishis say in days of yore. Instruction<br>should not be imparted unto one that belongs to a low or mean caste. It<br>is said that the preceptor who imparts instruction to such a person<br>incurs great fault. Listen to me, O chief of Bharata's race, as I recite<br>to thee, O Yudhishthira, this instance that occurred in days of old, O<br>monarch, of the evil consequences of the imparting of instruction unto a<br>low-born person fallen into distress. The incident which I shall relate<br>occurred in the asylum of certain regenerate sages that stood on the<br>auspicious breast of Himavat. There, on the breast of that prince of<br>mountains, was a sacred asylum adorned with trees of diverse kinds.<br>Overgrown also with diverse species of creepers and plants, it was the<br>resort of many animals and birds. Inhabited by Siddhas and Charanas also,<br>it was exceedingly delightful in consequence of the woods that flowered<br>these at every season. Many were the Brahmacharins that dwelt there, and<br>many belonging to the forest mode of life. Many also were the Brahmanas<br>that took up their residence there, that were highly blessed and that<br>resembled the sun or the fire in energy and effulgence. Ascetics of<br>diverse kinds, observant of various restraints and vows, as also others,<br>O chief of the Bharatas, that had undergone Diksha and were frugal in<br>fare and possessed of cleansed souls, took up their residence there.<br>Large numbers of Valakhilyas and many that were observant of the vow of<br>Sanyasa also, used to dwell there. The asylum, in consequence of all<br>this, resounded with the chanting of the Vedas and the sacred Mantras<br>uttered by its inhabitants. Once upon a time a Sudra endued with<br>compassion for all creatures, ventured to come into that asylum. Arrived<br>at that retreat, he was duly honoured by all the ascetics. Beholding<br>those ascetics of diverse classes that were endued with great energy,<br>that resembled the deities (in purity and power), and that were observing<br>diverse kinds of Diksha, O Bharata, the Sudra became highly pleased at<br>heart. Beholding everything, O chief of Bharata's race, the Sudra felt<br>inclined to devote himself to the practice of penances. Touching the feet<br>of the Kulapati (the head man of the group), O Bharata, he addressed him<br>saying,[19] 'Through thy grace, O foremost of regenerate persons, I<br>desire, to learn (and practise) the duties of religion. It behoveth thee,<br>O illustrious one, to discourse to me on those duties and introduce me<br>(by performing the rites of initiation) into a life of Renunciation. I am<br>certainly inferior in colour, O illustrious one, for I am by caste a<br>Sudra, O best of men. I desire to wait upon and serve you here. Be<br>gratified with me that humbly seek thy shelter.'"<br><br>"The Kulapati said, 'It is impossible that a Sudra should live here<br>adopting the marks specially intended for those practising lives of<br>Renunciation. If it pleases thee, thou mayest stay here, engaged in<br>waiting upon and serving us. Without doubt, by such service thou shalt<br>attain to many regions of high felicity.'"<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by the ascetic, the Sudra began to<br>reflect in his mind, O king, saying, How should I now act? Great is my<br>reverence for those religious duties that lead to merit. Let this,<br>however, be settled, that I shall do what would be for my benefit.'[20]<br>Proceeding to a spot that was distant from that asylum, he made a hut of<br>the twigs and leaves of trees. Erecting also a sacrificial platform, and<br>making a little space for his sleep, and some platforms for the use of<br>the deities, he began, O chief of the Bharatas, to lead a life regulated<br>by rigid observances and vows and to practise penances, abstaining<br>entirely from speech all the while. He began to perform ablutions thrice<br>a day, observe other vows (in respect of food and sleep), make sacrifices<br>to the deities, pour libations on the sacrificial fire, and adore the<br>worship and deities in this way. Restraining all carnal desires, living<br>abstemiously upon fruits and roots, controlling all his senses, he daily<br>welcomed and entertained all that came to his retreat as guests, offering<br>them herbs and fruits that grew plentifully around. In this way he passed<br>a very long time in that hermitage of his.[21] One day an ascetic came to<br>that Sudra's retreat for the purpose of making his acquaintance. The<br>Sudra welcomed and worshipped the Rishi with due rites, and gratified him<br>highly. Endued with great energy, and possessed of a righteous soul, that<br>Rishi of rigid vows conversed with his host on many agreeable subjects<br>and informed him of the place whence he had come. In this way, O chief of<br>the Bharatas, that Rishi, O best of men, came into the asylum of the<br>Sudra times out of a number for the object of seeing him. On one of these<br>occasions, the Sudra, O king, addressing the Rishi said,&#8212;I desire to<br>perform the rites that are ordained for the Pitris. Do thou instruct me<br>kindly in this matter.&#8212;Very well,&#8212;the Brahmana said in reply unto him,<br>O monarch. The Sudra then, purifying himself by a bath, brought water for<br>the Rishi to wash his feet, and he also brought some Kusa grass, and wild<br>herbs and fruits, and a sacred seat, and the seat called Vrishi. The<br>Vrishi, however, was placed by the Sudra towards the south, with his head<br>turned to the west. Beholding, this and knowing that it was against the<br>ordinance, the Rishi addressed the Sudra, saying,&#8212;Place the Vrishi with<br>its head turned towards the East, and having purified thyself, do thou<br>sit with thy face turned towards the north&#8212;The Sudra did everything as<br>the Rishi directed. Possessed of great intelligence, and observant of<br>righteousness, the Sudra received every direction, about the Sraddha, as<br>laid down in the ordinance, from that Rishi endued with penances<br>regarding the manner of spreading the Kusa grass, and placing the<br>Arghyas, and as regards the rites to be observed in the matter of the<br>libations to be poured and the food to be offered. After the rites in<br>honour of the Pitris had been accomplished, the Rishi, was dismissed by<br>the Sudra, whereupon he returned to his own abode.[22] After a long time,<br>the whole of which he passed in the practice of such penances and vows,<br>the Sudra ascetic met with his death in those woods. In consequence of<br>the merit he acquired by those practices, the Sudra in the next life,<br>took birth in the family of a great king, and in course of time became<br>possessed of great splendour. The regenerate Rishi also, when the time<br>came, paid his debt in Nature. In his next life, O chief of Bharata's<br>race, he took birth in the family of a priest. It was in this way that<br>those two, viz., that Sudra who had passed a life of penances and that<br>regenerate Rishi who had in kindness given the former some instructions<br>in the matter of the rites performed in honour of the Pitris, became<br>reborn, the one as scion of a royal race and the other as the member of a<br>priestly family. Both of them began to grow and both acquired great<br>knowledge in the usual branches of study. The Brahmana became well versed<br>in the Vedas as also in the Atharvans.[23] In the matter, again of all<br>sacrifices ordained in the Sutras, of that Vedanga which deals with<br>religious rites and observances, astrology and astronomy the reborn Rishi<br>attained great excellence. In the Sankhya philosophy too he began to take<br>great delight. Meanwhile, the reborn Sudra who had become a prince, when<br>his father, the king died, performed his last rites; and after he had<br>purified himself by accomplishing all the obsequial ceremonies, he was<br>installed by the subjects of his father as their king on his paternal<br>throne. But soon after his own installation as king, he installed the<br>reborn Rishi as his priest. Indeed, having made the Brahmana his priest,<br>the king began to pass his days in great happiness. He ruled his kingdom<br>righteously and protected and cherished all his subjects. Everyday,<br>however, the king on the occasion of receiving benedictions from his<br>priest as also of the performance of religious and other sacred rites,<br>smiled or laughed at him loudly. In this way, O monarch, the reborn Sudra<br>who had become a king, laughed at sight of his priest on numberless<br>occasions.[24] The priest, marking that the king always smiled or laughed<br>whenever he happened to cast his eyes on him, became angry. On one<br>occasion he met the king in a place where there was nobody else. He<br>pleased the king by agreeable discourse. Taking advantage of that moment,<br>O chief of Bharata's race, the priest addressed the king, saying,&#8212;'O<br>thou of great splendour, I pray thee to grant me a single boon.'<br><br>"The king said, 'O best of regenerate persons, I am ready to grant thee a<br>hundred of boons, what dost thou say then of one only? From the affection<br>I bear thee and the reverence in which I hold thee, there is nothing that<br>I cannot give thee.'<br><br>"The priest said, 'I desire to have only one boon, O king, thou hast been<br>pleased with me. Swear that thou wouldst tell me the truth instead of any<br>untruth.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by the priest, O Yudhishthira, the<br>king said unto him&#8212;So be it. If what thou wouldst ask me be known to me,<br>I shall certainly tell thee truly. If on the other hand, the matter be<br>unknown to me, I shall not say anything.'<br><br>"The priest said, 'Every day, on occasions of obtaining my benedictions,<br>when, again, I am engaged in the performance of religious rites on thy<br>behalf, on occasions also of the Homa and other rites of propitiation,<br>why is it that thou laughest upon beholding me? Seeing thee laugh at me<br>on all occasions, my mind shrinks with shame. I have caused thee to<br>swear, O king, that thou wouldst answer me truly. It does not behove thee<br>to say what is untrue. There must be some grave reason for thy behaviour.<br>Thy laughter cannot be causeless. Great is my curiosity to know the<br>reason. Do thou speak truly unto me.'<br><br>"The king said, 'When thou hast addressed me in this strain, O regenerate<br>one, I am bound to enlighten thee, even if the matter be one that should<br>not be divulged in thy hearing. I must tell thee the truth. Do thou<br>listen to me with close attention, O regenerate one. Listen to me, O<br>foremost of twice-born persons, as I disclose to thee what happened (to<br>us) in our former births. I remember that birth. Do thou listen to me<br>with concentrated mind. In my former life I was a Sudra employed in the<br>practice of severe penances. Thou, O best of regenerate persons, wert a<br>Rishi of austere penances. O sinless one, gratified with me, and impelled<br>by the desire of doing me good, thou, O Brahmana, wert pleased to give me<br>certain instructions in the rites I performed (on one occasion) in honour<br>of my Pitris. The instructions thou gayest me were in respect of the<br>manner of spreading the Vrishi and the Kusa blades and of offering<br>libations and meat and other food to the manes, O foremost of ascetics.<br>In consequence of this transgression of thine thou hast taken birth as a<br>priest, and I have taken birth as a king, O foremost of Brahmanas. Behold<br>the vicissitudes that Time brings about. Thou hast reaped this fruit in<br>consequence of thy having instructed me (in my former birth). It is for<br>this reason, O Brahmana, that I smile at sight of thee, O foremost of<br>regenerate persons. I do not certainly laugh at thee from desire of<br>disregarding thee. Thou art my preceptor.[25] At this change of condition<br>I am really very sorry. My heart burns at the thought. I remember our<br>former births, hence do I laugh at sight of thee. Thy austere penances<br>were all destroyed by the instructions thou gayest me. Relinquishing thy<br>present office of priest, do thou endeavour to regain a superior birth.<br>Do thou exert so that thou mayst not obtain in thy next life a birth<br>meaner than thy present one. Take as much wealth as thou wishest. O<br>learned Brahmana, and cleanse thy soul, O best of men.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Dismissed by the king (from the office of priest),<br>the Brahmana made many gifts, unto persons of his own order, of wealth<br>and land and villages. He observed many rigid and severe vows as laid<br>down by the foremost of Brahmanas. He sojourned to many sacred waters and<br>made many gifts unto Brahmanas in those places. Making gifts of kine unto<br>persons of the regenerate order, his soul became cleansed and he<br>succeeded in acquiring a knowledge of it. Repairing to that very asylum<br>whither he had lived in his former birth, he practised very severe<br>penances. As the consequence of all this, O foremost of kings, that<br>Brahmana succeeded in attaining to the highest success. He became an<br>object of veneration with all the ascetics that dwelt in that asylum. In<br>this way, O best of monarchs, that regenerate Rishi fell into great<br>distress. Unto Sudras, therefore, the Brahmanas should never give<br>instructions. Hence, O king, the Brahmana should avoid imparting<br>instructions (to such as are low-born), for it was by imparting<br>instruction to a low-born person a Brahmana came to grief. O best of<br>kings, the Brahmana should never desire to obtain instruction from, or<br>impart instruction to, a person that belongs to the lowest order.<br>Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas, the three orders, are regarded as<br>twice-born. By imparting instruction unto these, a Brahmana does not<br>incur any fault. They, therefore, that are good, should never discourse<br>on any subject, for imparting any instruction, before persons of the<br>inferior order. The course of morality is exceedingly subtile and<br>incapable of being comprehended by persons of uncleansed souls. It is for<br>this reason that ascetics adopt the vow of silence, and being respected<br>by all, pass through Diksha (initiation) without indulging in speech.[26]<br>For fear of saying what is incorrect or what may offend, ascetics often<br>forego speech itself. Even men that are righteous and possessed of every<br>accomplishment, and endued with truth and simplicity of behaviour, have<br>been known to incur great fault in consequence of words spoken<br>improperly. Instruction should never be imparted on anything unto any<br>person. If in consequence of the instructions imparted, the instructed<br>commit any sin, that sin, attaches to the Brahmana who imparted the<br>instruction. The man of wisdom, therefore, that desires to earn merit,<br>should always act with wisdom. That instruction which is imparted in<br>barter for money always pollutes the instructor.[27] Solicited by others,<br>one should say only what is correct after settling it with the aid of<br>reflection. One should impart instruction in such a way that one may, by<br>imparting it, earn merit. I have thus told thee everything respecting the<br>subject of instructions. Very often persons become plunged into great<br>afflictions in consequence of imparting instructions. Hence it is meet<br>that one should abstain from giving instruction unto others.'"
