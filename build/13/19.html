                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I ask, O chief of Bharata's race, what is the origin<br>of the saying, about discharging all duties jointly at the time of a<br>person's taking the hand of his spouse in marriage? Is that saying in<br>respect of discharging all duties together, due only to what is laid down<br>by the great Rishis in days of yore, or does it refer to the duty of<br>begetting offspring from religious motives, or has it reference to only<br>the carnal pleasure that is expected from such union? I he doubt that<br>fills my mind in this respect is very great. What is spoken of as joint<br>duties by the sages is in my consideration incorrect. That which is<br>called in this world the union for practising all duties together ceases<br>with death and is not to be seen to subsist hereafter. This union for<br>practising all duties together leads to heaven. But heaven, O grandsire,<br>is attained to by persons that are dead. Of a married couple it is seen<br>that only one dies at a time. Where does the other then remain? Do tell<br>me this. Men attain to diverse kinds of fruits by practising diverse<br>kinds of duties. The occupations again, to which men betake themselves<br>are of diverse kinds. Diverse, again, are the hells to which they go in<br>consequence of such diversity of duties and acts. Women, in particular,<br>the Rishis have said, are false in behaviour. When human beings are such,<br>and when women in particular have been declared in the ordinances to be<br>false, how, O sire, can there be a union between the sexes for purposes<br>of practising all duties together? In the very Vedas one may read that<br>women are false. The word 'Duty', as used in the Vedas, seems to have<br>been coined in the first instance for general application (so that it is<br>applied to practices that have no merit in them). Hence the application<br>of that word to the rites of marriage is, instead of being correct, only<br>a form of speech forcibly applied where application it has none.[187] The<br>subject seems to me to be inexplicable although I reflect upon it<br>incessantly. O grandsire, O thou of great wisdom, it behoveth thee to<br>expound this to me in detail, clearly and according to what has been laid<br>down in the Sruti. In fact, do thou explain to me what its<br>characteristics are, and the way in which it has come to pass!'[188]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative of the<br>discourse between Ashtavakra and the lady known by the name of Disa. In<br>days of yore Ashtavakra of severe penances, desirous of marriage, begged<br>the high-souled Rishi Vadanya of his daughter. The name by which the<br>damsel was known was Suprabha. In beauty she was unrivalled on Earth. In<br>virtues, dignity, conduct, and manners, she was superior to all the<br>girls. By a glance alone that girl of beautiful eyes had robbed him of<br>his heart even as a delightful grove in spring, adorned with flowers,<br>robs the spectator of his heart. The Rishi addressed Ashtavakra and<br>said,&#8212;Yes, I shall bestow my daughter on thee. Listen, however, to me.<br>Make a journey to the sacred North. Thou wilt see many things there!'[189]<br><br>"Ashtavakra said, 'It behoveth thee to tell me what I shall see in that<br>region. Indeed, I am ready to execute whatever command may be laid upon<br>me by thee.'"<br><br>"Vadanya said, 'Passing over the dominions of the lord of Treasures thou<br>will cross the Himavat mountains. Thou wilt then behold the plateau on<br>which Rudra resides. It is inhabited by Siddhas and Charanas. It abounds<br>with the associates of Mahadeva, frolicsome and fond of dance and<br>possessed of diverse forms. It is peopled with also many Pisachas, O<br>master, of diverse forms and all daubed with fragrant powders of diverse<br>hues, and dancing with joyous hearts in accompaniment with instruments of<br>different kinds made of brass. Surrounded by these who move with electric<br>rapidity in the mazes of the dance or refrain at times altogether from<br>forward or backward or transverse motion of every kind, Mahadeva dwells<br>there. That delightful spot on the mountains, we have heard, is the<br>favourite abode of the great Deity. It is said that that great god as<br>also his associates are always present there. It was there that the<br>goddess Uma practised the severest austerities for the sake of (obtaining<br>for her lord) the three-eyed Deity. Hence, it is said, that spot is much<br>liked by both Mahadeva and Uma. In days of yore there, on the heights of<br>the Mahaparswa, which are situate to the north of the mountains sacred to<br>Mahadeva, the sessions, and the last Night, and many deities, and many<br>human beings also (of the foremost order), in their embodied forms, had<br>adored Mahadeva.[190] Thou shalt cross that region also in thy northward<br>journey. Thou will then see a beautiful and charming forest blue of hue<br>and resembling a mass of clouds. There, in that forest, thou wilt behold<br>a beautiful female ascetic looking like Sree herself. Venerable in age<br>and highly blessed, she is in the observance of the Diksha. Beholding her<br>there thou shouldst duly worship her with reverence. Returning to this<br>place after having beheld her, thou wilt take the hand of my daughter in<br>marriage. If thou wanteth to make this agreement, proceed then on thy<br>journey and do what I command thee.'"<br><br>"Ashtavakra said, 'So be it. I shall do thy bidding. Verily, I shall<br>proceed to that region which thou speakest of, O thou of righteous soul.<br>On thy side, let thy words, accord with truth.'"<br><br>"Bhishma continued, "The illustrious Ashtavakra set out on his journey.<br>He proceeded more and more towards the north and at last reached the<br>Himavat mountains peopled by Siddhas and Charanas.[191] Arrived at the<br>Himavat mountains, that foremost of Brahamanas then came upon the sacred<br>river Vahuda whose waters produce great merit. He bathed in one of the<br>delightful Tirthas of that river, which was free from mud, and gratified<br>the deities with oblations of water. His ablutions being over, he spread<br>a quantity of Kusa grass and laid himself down upon it for resting awhile<br>at his ease.[192] Passing the night in this way, the Brahmana rose with<br>the day. He once more performed his ablutions in the sacred waters of the<br>Vahuda and then ignited his homa fire and worshipped it with the aid of<br>many foremost of Vedic mantras.[193] He then worshipped with due rites<br>both Rudra and his spouse Uma, and rested for some more time by the side<br>of that lake in the course of the Vahuda whose shores he had reached.<br>Refreshed by such rest, he set out from that region and then proceeded<br>towards Kailasa. He then beheld a gate of gold that seemed to blaze with<br>beauty. He saw also the Mandakini and the Nalini of the high-souled<br>Kuvera, the Lord of Treasures.[194] Beholding the Rishi arrived there,<br>all the Rakshasas having Manibhadra for their head, who were engaged in<br>protecting that lake abounding with beautiful lotuses, came out in a body<br>for welcoming and honouring the illustrious traveller. The Rishi<br>worshipped in return those Rakshasas of terrible prowess and asked them<br>to report, without delay, his arrival unto the Lord of Treasures.<br>Requested by him to do this, those Rakshasas, O king, said unto<br>him,&#8212;King Vaisravana, without waiting for the news from us, is coming of<br>his own accord to thy presence. The illustrious Lord of Treasures is well<br>acquainted with the object of this thy journey. Behold him,&#8212;that blessed<br>Master,&#8212;who blazes with his own energy. Then king Vaisravana,<br>approaching the faultless Ashtavakra, duly enquired about his welfare.<br>The usual enquiries of politeness being over, the Lord of Treasures then<br>addressed the regenerate Rishi, saying,&#8212;Welcome art thou here. Do tell<br>me what it is thou seekest at my hands. Inform me of it. I shall, O<br>regenerate one, accomplish whatever thou mayst bid me to accomplish. Do<br>thou enter my abode as pleases thee, O foremost of Brahamanas. Duly<br>entertained by me, and after thy business is accomplished, thou mayst go<br>without any obstacles being placed in thy way.&#8212;Having said these words,<br>Kuvera took the hand of that foremost of Brahmanas and led him into his<br>palace. He offered him his own seat as also water to wash his feet and<br>the Arghya made of the usual ingredients. After the two had taken their<br>seats, the Yakshas of Kuvera headed by Manibhadra, and many Gandharvas<br>and Kinnaras, also sat down before them. After all of them had taken<br>their seats, the Lord of Treasures said these words,&#8212;Understanding what<br>thy pleasure is, the diverse tribes of Apsaras will commence their dance.<br>It is meet that I should entertain thee with hospitality and that thou<br>shouldst be served with proper ministrations. Thus addressed, the ascetic<br>Ashtavakra said, in a sweet voice, Let the dance proceed. Then Urvara and<br>Misrakesi, and Rambha and Urvasi, and Alumvusha and Ghritachi, and Chitra<br>and Chitrangada and Ruchi, and Manohara and Sukesi and Sumukhi and Hasini<br>and Prabha, and Vidyuta, and Prasami and Danta and Vidyota and<br>Rati,&#8212;these and many other beautiful Apsaras began to dance. The<br>Gandharvas played on diverse kinds of musical instruments. After such<br>excellent music and dance had commenced, the Rishi Ashtavakra of severe<br>penances unconsciously passed a full celestial year there in the abode of<br>king Vaisravana.[195] Then king Vaisravana said unto the Rishi,&#8212;O<br>learned Brahmana, behold, a little more than a year has passed away since<br>thy arrival here. This music and dance, especially known by the name of<br>Gandharva, is a stealer of the heart (and of time). Do thou act as thou<br>wishes or let this go on if that be thy pleasure. Thou art my guest and,<br>therefore, worthy of adoration. This is my house. Givest thou thy<br>commands. We are all bound to thee. The illustrious Ashtavakra, thus<br>addressed by king Vaisravana, replied unto him, with a pleased heart,<br>saying,&#8212;I have been duly honoured by thee. I desire now, O Lord of<br>Treasures, to go hence. Indeed, I am highly pleased. All this befits<br>thee, O Lord of Treasures. Through thy grace, O illustrious one, and<br>agreeably to the command of the high-souled Rishi Vadanya, I shall now<br>proceed to my journey's end. Let growth and prosperity be thine.&#8212;Having<br>said these words, the illustrious Rishi set out of Kuvera's abode and<br>proceeded northwards. He crossed the Kailasa and the Mandara as also the<br>golden mountains. Beyond those high and great mountains is situated that<br>excellent region where Mahadeva, dressed as an humble ascetic, has taken<br>up his residence. He circumambulated the spot, with concentrated mind,<br>bending his head in reverence the while. Descending then on the Earth, he<br>considered himself sanctified for having obtained a sight of that holy<br>spot which is the abode of Mahadeva. Having circumambulated that mountain<br>thrice, the Rishi, with face turned towards the north, proceeded with a<br>joyous heart. He then beheld another forest that was very delightful in<br>aspect. It was adorned with the fruits and roots of every season, and it<br>resounded with the music of winged warblers numbering by thousands. There<br>were many delightful groves throughout the forest. The illustrious Rishi<br>then beheld a charming hermitage. The Rishi saw also many golden hills<br>decked with gems and possessed of diverse forms. In the begemmed soil he<br>saw many lakes and tanks also. And he saw diverse other objects that were<br>exceedingly delightful. Beholding these things, the mind of that Rishi of<br>cleansed soul became filled with joy. He then saw a beautiful mansion<br>made of gold and adorned with gems of many kinds. Of wonderful structure,<br>that mansion surpassed the place of Kuvera himself in every respect.<br>Around it there were many hills and mounts of jewels and gems. Many<br>beautiful cars and many heaps of diverse kinds of jewels also were<br>visible in that place. The Rishi beheld there the river Mandakini whose<br>waters were strewn with many Mandara flowers. Many gems also were seen<br>there that were self-luminous, and the soil all around was decked with<br>diamonds of diverse species. The palatial mansion which the Rishi saw<br>contained many chambers whose arches were embellished with various kinds<br>of stones. Those chambers were adorned also with nets of pearls<br>interspersed with jewels and gems of different species. Diverse kinds of<br>beautiful objects capable of stealing the heart and the eye, surrounded<br>that palace. That delightful retreat was inhabited by numerous Rishis.<br>Beholding these beautiful sights all around, the Rishi began to think<br>where he would take shelter. Proceeding then to the gate of the mansion,<br>he uttered these words:&#8212;Let those that live here know that a guest has<br>come (desirous of shelter). Hearing the voice of the Rishi, a number of<br>maidens came out together from that palace. They were seven in number, O<br>King, of different styles of beauty, all of them were exceedingly<br>charming. Every one of those maidens upon whom the Rishi cast his eyes,<br>stole his heart. The sage could not, with even his best efforts, control<br>his mind. Indeed, at the sight of those maidens of very superior beauty,<br>his heart lost all its tranquillity. Seeing himself yielding to such<br>influences, the Rishi made a vigorous effort and possessed as he was of<br>great wisdom he at last succeeded in controlling himself. Those damsels<br>then addressed the Rishi, saying,&#8212;Let the illustrious one enter. Filled<br>with curiosity in respect of those exceedingly beautiful damsels as also<br>of that palatial mansion, the regenerate Rishi entered as he was bidden.<br>Entering the mansion he beheld an old lady, with indications of<br>decrepitude, attired in white robes and adorned with every kind of<br>ornament. The Rishi blessed her, saying,&#8212;Good be to you.&#8212;The old lady<br>returned his good wishes in proper form. Rising up, she offered a seat to<br>the Rishi. Having taken his seat, Ashtavakra said,&#8212;Let all the damsels<br>go to their respective quarters. Only let one stay here. Let that one<br>remain here who is possessed of wisdom and who has tranquillity of heart.<br>Indeed, let all the others go away at their will.&#8212;Thus addressed, all<br>those damsels circumambulated the Rishi and then left the chamber. Only<br>that aged lady remained there. The day quickly passed and night came. The<br>Rishi seated on a splendid bed, addressed the old lady, saying,&#8212;O<br>blessed lady, the night is deepening. Do thou address thyself to sleep.<br>Their conversation being thus put a stop to by the Rishi, the old lady<br>laid herself down on an excellent bed of great splendour. Soon after, she<br>rose from her bed and pretending to tremble with cold, she left it for<br>going to the bed of the Rishi. The illustrious Ashtavakra welcomed her<br>with courtesy. The lady however, stretching her arms, tenderly embraced<br>the Rishi, O foremost of men. Beholding the Rishi quite unmoved and as<br>inanimate as a piece of wood, she became very sorry and began to converse<br>with him. There is no pleasure, save that which waits upon Kama (desire),<br>which women can derive from a person of the other sex. I am now under the<br>influence of desire. I seek thee for that reason. Do thou seek me in<br>return. Be cheerful, O learned Rishi, and unite thyself with me. Do thou<br>embrace me, O learned one, for I desire thee greatly. O thou of righteous<br>soul, even this union with me is the excellent and desirable reward of<br>those severe penances which thou hast undergone. At the first sight I<br>have become disposed to seek thee. Do thou also seek me. All this wealth,<br>and everything else of value that thou seest here are mine. Do thou<br>verily become the lord of all this along with my person and heart. I<br>shall gratify every wish of thine. Do thou sport with me, therefore, in<br>these delightful forest, O Brahmana, that are capable of granting every<br>wish. I shall yield thee complete obedience in everything, and thou shall<br>sport with me according to thy pleasure. All objects of desire that are<br>human or that appertain to heaven shall be enjoyed by us. There is no<br>pleasure more agreeable to women (than that which is derivable from the<br>companionship of a person of the other sex). Verily, congress with a<br>person of the opposite sex is the most delicious fruit of joy that we can<br>reap. When urged by the god of desire, women become very capricious. At<br>such times they do not feel any pain, even if they walk over a desert of<br>burning sand.'"<br><br>"Ashtavakra said, 'O blessed lady, I never approach one that is another's<br>spouse. One's congress with another man's wife is condemned by persons<br>conversant with the scriptures on morality. I am an utter stranger to<br>enjoyments of every kind. O blessed lady, know that I have become<br>desirous of wedlock for obtaining offspring. I swear by truth itself.<br>Through the aid of offspring righteously obtained, I shall proceed to<br>those regions of felicity which cannot be attained without such aid. O<br>good lady, know what is consistent with morality, and knowing it, desist<br>from thy efforts.'"<br><br>"The lady said, 'The very deities of wind and fire and water, or the<br>other celestials, O regenerate one, are not so agreeable to women as the<br>deity of desire. Verily, women are exceedingly fond of sexual congress.<br>Among a thousand women, or, perhaps, among hundreds of thousands,<br>sometimes only one may be found that is devoted to her husband. When<br>under the influence of desire, they care not for family or father or<br>mother or brother or husband or sons or husband's brother (but pursue the<br>way that desire points out). Verily, in pursuit of what they consider<br>happiness, they destroy the family (to which they belong by birth or<br>marriage) even as many queenly rivers eat away the banks that contain<br>them. The Creator himself had said this, quickly marking the faults of<br>women.'"[196]<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The Rishi, bent upon finding out the faults of<br>women, then addressed that lady, saying,&#8212;Cease to speak to me in this<br>strain. Yearning springs from liking. Tell me what (else) I am to<br>do.[197]&#8212;That lady then said in return,&#8212;O illustrious one, thou shalt<br>see according to time and place (as do whether I have anything agreeable<br>in me). Do thou only live here (for some time). O highly blessed one, and<br>I shall regard myself amply rewarded.&#8212;Thus addressed by her, the<br>regenerate Rishi, O Yudhishthira, expressed his resolution to comply with<br>her request, saying,&#8212;Verily, I shall dwell with thee in this place as<br>long as I can venture to do so.&#8212;The Rishi then, beholding that lady<br>afflicted with decrepitude, began to reflect earnestly on the matter. He<br>seemed to be even tortured by his thoughts. The eyes of that foremost of<br>Brahmanas failed to derive any delight from those parts of that lady's<br>person whereupon they were cast. On the other hand, his glances seemed to<br>be dispelled by the ugliness of those particular limbs.&#8212;This lady is<br>certainly the goddess of this palace. Has she been made ugly through some<br>curse. It is not proper that I should hastily ascertain the cause of<br>this.&#8212;Reflecting upon this in the secrecy of his heart, and curious to<br>know the reason, the Rishi passed the rest of that day in an anxious<br>state. The lady then addressed him, saying,&#8212;O illustrious one, behold<br>the aspect of the Sun reddened by the evening clouds. What service shall<br>I do unto thee.&#8212;The Rishi addressed her, saying,&#8212;.'Fetch water for my<br>ablutions. Having bathed, I shall say my evening prayers, restraining my<br>tongue and the senses.'"
