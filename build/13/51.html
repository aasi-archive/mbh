                            "Bhishma said, 'King Nahusha hearing the pass to which Chyavana was<br>reduced, quickly proceeded to that spot accompanied by his ministers and<br>priest. Having cleansed himself duly, the king, with joined palms and<br>concentrated attention, introduced himself unto the high-souled Chyavana.<br>The king's priest then worshipped with due ceremonies that Rishi, O<br>monarch, who was observant of the vow of truth and endued with a high<br>soul, and who resembled a god himself (in splendour and energy).'<br><br>"Nahusha said, 'Tell me, O best of regenerate persons, what act shall we<br>do that may be agreeable to thee? However difficult that act may be,<br>there is nothing, O holy one, that I shall not be able to accomplish at<br>thy bidding.'<br><br>"Chyavana said, 'These men that live by catching fish have all been tried<br>with labour. Do thou pay them the price that may be set upon me along<br>with the value of these fish.'<br><br>"Nahusha said, 'Let my priest give unto these Nishadas a thousand coins<br>as a price for purchasing these sacred one as he himself has commanded.'<br><br>"Chyavana said, 'A thousand coins cannot represent my price. The question<br>depends upon your discretion. Give them a fair value, settling with thy<br>own intelligence what it should be.'<br><br>"Nahusha said, 'Let, O learned Brahmana, a hundred thousand coins be<br>given unto these Nishadas. Shall this be thy price, O holy one, or dost<br>think otherwise?'<br><br>"Chyavana said, 'I should not be purchased for a hundred thousand coins,<br>O best of monarchs! Let a proper price be given unto them. Do thou<br>consult with thy ministers.'<br><br>"Nahusha said, 'Let my priest give unto these Nishadas a crore of coins.<br>If even this does not represent thy price, let more be paid unto them.'<br><br>"Chyavana said, 'O king, I do not deserve to be purchased for a crore of<br>coins or even more. Let that price be given unto those men which would be<br>fair or proper. Do thou 'consult with the Brahmanas.'<br><br>"Nahusha said, 'Let half of my kingdom or even the whole be given away<br>unto these Nishadas. I think that would represent thy price. What,<br>however, dost thou think, O regenerate one?'<br><br>"Chyavana said, 'I do not deserve to be purchased with half thy kingdom<br>or even the whole of it, O king! Let thy price which is proper be given<br>unto these men. Do thou consult with the Rishis.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Hearing these words of the great Rishi, Nahusha<br>became afflicted with great grief. With his ministers and priest he began<br>to deliberate on the matter. There then came unto king Nahusha an ascetic<br>living in the woods and subsisting upon fruit and roots and born of a<br>cow. That best of regenerate persons, addressing the monarch, O king,<br>said these words, 'I shall soon gratify thee. The Rishi also will be<br>gratified. I shall never speak an untruth.&#8212;no, not even in jest, what<br>then need I say of other occasions? Thou shouldst, without any scruple,<br>do what I bid thee.'<br><br>"Nahusha said, 'Do thou, O illustrious one, say what the price is of that<br>great Rishi of Bhrigu's race. O, save me from this terrible pass, save my<br>kingdom, and save my race! If the holy Chyavana became angry, he would<br>destroy the three worlds: what need I say them of my poor self who is<br>destitute of penances and who depends only upon the might of his arm? O<br>great Rishi, do thou become the raft unto us that have all fallen into a<br>fathomless ocean with all our counsellors and our priest! Do thou settle<br>what the price should be of the Rishi.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Hearing these words of Nahusha, the ascetic born of a cow<br>and endued with great energy spoke in this strain, gladdening the monarch<br>and all his counsellors, 'Brahmanas, O king, belong to the foremost of<br>the four orders. No value, however great, can be set upon them. Cows also<br>are invaluable. Therefore, O chief of men, do thou regard a cow as the<br>value of the Rishi.' Hearing these words of the great Rishi, Nahusha<br>became, O king, filled with joy along with all his counsellors and<br>priest. Proceeding then to the presence of Bhrigu's son, Chyavana, of<br>rigid vows, h e addressed him thus, O monarch, for gratifying him to the<br>best of his ability.'<br><br>'Nahusha said, 'Rise, rise, O regenerate Rishi, thou hast been purchased.<br>O son of Bhirgu, with a cow as thy price. O foremost of righteous<br>persons, even this, I think, is thy price.'<br><br>"Chyavana said. 'Yes, O king of kings, I do rise up. I have been properly<br>purchased by thee, O sinless one! I do not, O thou of unfading glory, see<br>any wealth that is equal to kine. To speak of kine, to hear others speak<br>of them, to make gifts of kine, and to see kine, O king, are acts that<br>are all applauded, O hero, and that are highly auspicious and<br>sin-cleansing. Kine are always the root of prosperity. There is no fault<br>in kine. Kine always afford the best food, in the form of Havi, unto the<br>deities. The sacred Mantras, Swaha and Vashat, are always established<br>upon kine. Kine are the chief conductresses of sacrifices. They<br>constitute the mouth of sacrifice. They bear and yield excellent and<br>strength-giving nectar. They receive the worship of all the worlds and<br>are regarded as the source of nectar. On earth, kine resemble fire in<br>energy and form. Verily, kine represent high energy, and are bestowers of<br>great happiness upon all creatures. That country where kine, established<br>by their owners, breathe fearlessly, shines in beauty. The sins, also of<br>that country are all washed off. Kine constitute the stairs that lead to<br>heaven. Kine are adorned in heaven itself. Kine are goddesses that are<br>competent to give everything and grant every wish. There is nothing else<br>in the world that is so high or so superior!'[305]<br><br>"Bhishma continued, "Even this is what I say unto thee on the subject of<br>the glory and superiority of kine, O chief of Bharata's race. I am<br>competent to proclaim a part only of the merits that attach to kine. I<br>have not the ability to exhaust the subject!'<br><br>"Then Nishadas said, 'O ascetic, thou hast seen us and hast also spoken<br>with us. It has been said that friendship with those that are good,<br>depends upon only seven words[306]. Do thou then, O lord, show us thy<br>grace. The blazing sacrificial fire eats all the oblations of clarified<br>butter poured upon it. Of righteous soul, and possessed of great energy<br>thou art among men, a blazing fire in energy. We propitiate thee, O thou<br>of great learning! We surrender ourselves to thee. Do thou, for showing<br>us favour, take back from us this cow.'<br><br>"Chyavana said, 'The eye of a person that is poor or that has fallen into<br>distress, the eye of an ascetic, or the eye of a snake of virulent<br>poison, consumes a man with his very roots, even as a fire that, blazing<br>up with the assistance of the wind, consumes a stack of dry grass or<br>straw. I shall accent the cow that ye desire to present me. Ye fishermen,<br>freed from every sin, go ye to heaven without any delay, with these<br>fishes also that ye have caught with your nets.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'After this, in consequence of the energy of the<br>great Rishi of cleansed soul, those fishermen along with all those fish<br>through virtue of those words that he had uttered, proceeded to heaven.<br>King Nahusha, beholding the fishermen ascending to heaven with those<br>fishes in their company, became filled with wonder, O chief of Bharata's<br>race. After this, the two Rishis, viz., the one born of a cow and the<br>other who was Chyavana of Bhrigu's race, gladdened king Nahusha by<br>granting him many boons. Then king Nahusha of great energy, that lord of<br>all the earth, filled with joy, O best of the Bharatas, said,<br>'Sufficient!' Like unto a second Indra, the chief of the celestials, he<br>accepted the boon about his own steadiness in virtue. The Rishis having<br>granted him the boon, the delighted king worshipped them both with great<br>reverence. As regards Chyavana, his vow having been completed, he<br>returned to his own asylum. The Rishi that had taken his birth from the<br>cow, and who was endued with great energy, also proceeded to his own<br>retreat. The Nishadas all ascended to heaven as also the fishes they had<br>caught, O monarch. King Nahusha, too, having obtained those valuable<br>boons, entered his own city. I have thus, O son, told thee everything<br>respecting what thou hadst asked me. The affection that is generated by<br>the sight alone of others as also by the fact of living with them, O<br>Yudhishthira, and the high-blessedness of kine too, and the ascertainment<br>of true righteousness, are the topics upon which I have discoursed. Tell<br>me, O hero what else is in thy breast.'"
