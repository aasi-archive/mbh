                            "Narada said, 'At the conclusion of Mahadeva's speech, loud roars were<br>heard in the firmament. Thunders bellowed, with flashes of lightening.<br>The welkin was enveloped with blue and thick clouds. The deity of the<br>clouds then poured pure water like to what he does in the season of<br>rains. A thick darkness set in. The points of the compass could no longer<br>be distinguished. Then on that delightful, sacred, and eternal breast of<br>that celestial mountain, the assembled Rishis no longer saw the multitude<br>of ghostly beings that associate with Mahadeva. Soon, however, the welkin<br>cleared. Some of the Rishis set out for the sacred waters. Others<br>returned whence they came. Verily, beholding that wonderful and<br>inconceivable sight, they became filled with amazement. The discourse too<br>between Sankara and Uma had been heard by them with the feelings. That<br>foremost of all Beings, of whom the high-souled Sankara spoke to us on<br>that mountain, art Thou. Verily, thou art identical with Eternal Brahma.<br>Some time also Mahadeva burnt Himavat with his energy. Thou too hast<br>shown us a similar sight of wonder. Indeed, we have been put in<br>remembrance of that fact by what we have witnessed today. O mighty-armed<br>Janardana, I have thus, O puissant one, recited to thee the glory of that<br>god of gods, viz., him that is called Kapardin or Girisa!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by those denizens of ascetic<br>retreats, Krishna, the delighter of Devaki paid due honours unto all<br>those Rishis. Filled with delight, those Rishis once more addressed<br>Krishna, saying, 'O slayer of Madhu, do Thou repeatedly show Thyself to<br>us at all times! O puissant one, Heaven itself cannot rejoice us so much<br>as a right of Thyself Everything that was said by the illustrious Bhava<br>(regarding Thyself) is true. O crusher of foes, we have told Thee all<br>about that mystery. Thou art Thyself conversant with the truth of every<br>topic. Since, however, asked by us, it pleased Thee to ask us in return,<br>we have, for that reason, recited everything (about the discourse of<br>Bhava with Uma) to Thee for only pleasing Thee. There is nothing in the<br>three worlds that is unknown to Thee. Thou art fully conversant with the<br>birth and origin of all things, indeed, with everything that operates as<br>a cause (for the production of other objects). In consequence of the<br>lightness of our character, we are unable to bear (within ourselves the<br>knowledge of) any mystery (without disclosing it).[583] Indeed, in Thy<br>presence, O puissant one, we indulge in incoherences from the lightness<br>of our hearts. There is no wonderful thing that is unknown to Thee!<br>Whatever is on earth, and whatever is in heaven, all is known to Thee! We<br>take our leave of Thee, O Krishna, for returning to our respective abodes<br>Mayst Thou increase in intelligence and prosperity! O sire, Thou wilt<br>soon get a son like unto Thee or even more distinguished than Thyself. He<br>will be endued with great energy and splendour. He will achieve great<br>feats, and become possessed of puissance as great as Thine!'[584]<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'After this, the great Rishis bowed unto that god of<br>gods, that scion of Yadu's race, that foremost of all Beings. They then<br>circumambulated Him and taking His leave, departed. As regards Narayana,<br>who is endued with prosperity and blazing effulgence, He returned to<br>Dwaraka after having duly observed that vow of His. His spouse Rukmini<br>conceived, and on the expiration of the tenth month a son was born of<br>her, possessed of heroism and honoured by all for his highly wonderful<br>accomplishments. He is identical with that Kama (Desire) which exists in<br>every creature and which pervades every existent condition. Indeed, he<br>moves within the hearts of both gods and Asuras. This Krishna is that<br>foremost of all persons. Even he, endued with the hue of the clouds is<br>that four-handed Vasudeva. Through affection He has attached himself to<br>the Pandavas, and you also, ye sons of Pandu, have attached yourselves to<br>Him. Achievements, Prosperity, Intelligence, and the path that leads to<br>heaven, are all there where this one, viz., the illustrious Vishnu of<br>three steps, is. He is the three and thirty gods with Indra at their<br>head. There is no doubt in this. He is the one Ancient God. He is the<br>foremost of all gods. He is the refuge of all creatures. He. is without<br>beginning and without destruction. He is unmanifest. He is the<br>high-souled slayer of Madhu. Endued with mighty energy, He has taken<br>birth (among men) for accomplishing the purpose of the gods. Verily, this<br>Madhava is the expounder of the most difficult truths relating to Profit<br>or Wealth, and he is also their achiever. O son of Pritha, the victory<br>thou hast obtained over thy enemies, thy unrivalled achievements, the<br>dominion thou hast acquired over the whole earth, are all due to thy side<br>having been taken up by Narayana. The fact of thy having got the<br>inconceivable Narayana for thy protector and refuge, enabled thee to<br>become an Adharyu (chief sacrificer) for pouring multitudes of kings as<br>libations on the blazing fire of battle. This Krishna was thy great<br>sacrificial ladle resembling the all-destroying fire that appears at the<br>end of the Yuga. Duryodhana, with his sons, brothers and kinsmen, was<br>much to be pitied inasmuch as, moved by wrath, he made war with Hari and<br>the wielder of Gandiva. Many sons of Diti, many foremost of Danavas, of<br>huge bodies and vast strength, have perished in the fire of Krishna's<br>discus like insects in a forest conflagration. How incapable then must<br>human beings be of battling against that Krishna,&#8212;human beings who, O<br>tiger among men, are destitute of strength and might! As regards Jaya, he<br>is a mighty Yogin resembling the all-destroying Yuga-fire in energy.<br>Capable of drawing the bow equally with both hands, he is always in the<br>van of fight. With his energy, O king, he has slain all the troops of<br>Suyodhana. Listen to me as I tell thee what Mahadeva having the bovine<br>bull for the device on his standard had recited unto the ascetics on the<br>breast of the Himavat. His utterances constitute a Purana. The<br>advancement of greatness, energy, strength, prowess, puissance, humility,<br>and lineage that are in Arjuna can come up to only a third part of the<br>measure in which those attributes reside in Krishna. Who is there that<br>can transcend Krishna in these attributes? Whether that is possible or<br>not, listen (and judge). There where the illustrious Krishna is, there is<br>unrivalled Excellence.[585] As regards ourselves, we are persons of<br>little understanding. Dependent upon the will of others, we are<br>exceedingly unfortunate. Knowingly we betook ourselves to the eternal<br>path of death. Thou, however, art devoted to sincerity of conduct. Having<br>formerly pledged thyself against taking thy kingdom, thou didst not take<br>it, desirous of maintaining thy pledge.[586] O king, thou makest too much<br>of the slaughter of thy kinsmen and friends in battle (brought about, as<br>thou believest, by thyself). Thou shouldst remember, however, O chastiser<br>of foes, that it is not right to violate a pledge.[587] All those who<br>have fallen on the field of battle have really been slain by Time.<br>Verily, all of us have been slain by Time. Time is, indeed, all-powerful.<br>Thou art fully conversant with the puissance of Time. Afflicted by Time,<br>it does not behove thee to grieve. Know that Krishna Himself, otherwise<br>called Hari, is that Time with blood-red eyes and with club in hand. For<br>these reasons, O son of Kunti, it does not behove thee to grieve for thy<br>(slain) kinsfolk. Be thou always free, O delighter of the Kurus, from<br>grief. Thou hast heard of the glory and greatness of Madhava as recited<br>by me. That is sufficient for enabling a good man to understand Him.<br>Having heard the words of Vyasa as also of Narada endued with great<br>intelligence, I have discoursed to thee on the adorableness of Krishna. I<br>have myself added; from my own knowledge, something to that discourse.<br>Verily, I have discoursed also on the surpassing puissance of Krishna as<br>recited by Mahadeva, unto that conclave of Rishis (on the breast of the<br>Himavat). The discourse too between Maheswara and the daughter of<br>Himavat, O Bharata, has been recited by me to thee. He who will bear in<br>mind that discourse when emanating from a foremost person, he who will<br>listen to it, and he who will recite it (for other people's hearing), is<br>sure to win what is highly beneficial. That man will find all his wishes<br>fulfilled. Departing from this world he will ascend to Heaven. There is<br>no doubt in this. That man who, desirous of obtaining what is beneficial<br>for himself, should devote himself to Janardana. O king of the Kurus, it<br>behoves thee also to always bear in mind those incidents of duty and<br>righteousness which were declared by Maheswara. if thou conduct thyself<br>according to those precepts, if thou bear the rod of chastisement<br>rightly, if thou protect thy subjects properly, thou mayst be sure of<br>attaining to heaven. It behoves thee, O king, to protect thy subjects<br>always according to the dictates of righteousness. The stout rod of<br>chastisement which the king bears has been said to be the embodiment of<br>his righteousness or merit.[588] Hearing this discourse, fraught with<br>righteousness, between Sankara and Uma, that I have recited in the<br>presence of this righteous conclave, one should worship with reverence<br>that god having the bovine bull for the device on his banner. One that<br>becomes even desirous of listening to that discourse should worship<br>Mahadeva with reverence. Verily, the person that wishes to obtain what is<br>beneficial for him, should adore Mahadeva with a pure heart. Even this is<br>the command of the faultless and high-souled Narada. Even he has<br>commanded such worship of the great god, O son of Pandu, do thou obey<br>that command of Narada. O puissant king, even these are the wonderful<br>incidents that occurred on the sacred breast of the Himavat respecting<br>Vasudeva and Sthanu, O son of Kunti. Those occurrences flowed from the<br>very nature of those high-souled deities. Vasudeva, accompanied by the<br>wielder of Gandiva, practised eternal penances in the retreat of Vadari<br>for ten thousand years.[589] Verily, Vasudeva and Dhananjaya, both of<br>eyes like lotus-petals, underwent severe austerities for the duration of<br>three whole Yugas. I have learnt this from Narada and Vyasa, O king. The<br>lotus-eyed and mighty-armed Vasudeva, while yet a child (in human form)<br>achieved the great feat of slaying Kansa for the relief of his kinsmen. I<br>do not venture, O son of Kunti, to enumerate the feats of this Ancient<br>and Eternal Being, O Yudhishthira. Without doubt, O son, high and great<br>benefits will be reaped by thee who ownest that foremost of all persons,<br>viz., Vasudeva, for thy friend. I grieve for the wicked Duryodhana in<br>respect of even the next world to which he has gone. It was for him that<br>the whole earth has been depopulated with her seeds and elephants.<br>Indeed, through the fault of Duryodhana, of Karna, of Sakuni, and of<br>Duhsasana numbering the fourth, that the Kurus have perished.<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'While that foremost of men, viz., the son of<br>Ganga, addressed him in this strain, the Kuru king (Yudhishthira)<br>remained entirely silent in the midst of those high-souled persons (who<br>had assembled together for listening to the discourses of Bhishma). All<br>the kings with Dhritarashtra amongst them became filled with wonder upon<br>hearing the words of the Kuru grandsire. In their minds they worshipped<br>Krishna and then turned towards him with hands joined in reverence. The<br>Rishis also with Narada at their head, accepted and applauded the words<br>of Bhishma and approved of them joyfully. These were the wonderful<br>discourses recited by Bhishma which Pandu's son (Yudhishthira) with all<br>his brothers heard with joy. Some time after, when king (Yudhishthira)<br>saw that Ganga's son who had given away abundant wealth as presents unto<br>the Brahmanas in the sacrifices performed by him, had rested and become<br>refreshed, the intelligent king once more asked him as follows.'"
