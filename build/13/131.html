                            "Bhishma said, 'Then all the highly blessed deities and the Pitris, and<br>the highly blessed Rishis also, addressing the Pramathas, said,[557] 'Ye<br>are all highly blessed beings. Ye are invisible wanderers of the night.<br>Why do you afflict those men that are vile and impure and that are<br>unclean? What acts are regarded as impediments to your power? What,<br>indeed, are those acts in consequence of which ye become incompetent to<br>afflict men? What are those acts that are destructive of Rakshasas and<br>that prevent you from asserting your power over the habitations of men?<br>Ye wanderers of the night, we desire to hear all this from you.'<br><br>"The Pramathas said, 'Men are rendered unclean by acts of sexual<br>congress. They who do not purify themselves after such acts, they who<br>insult their superiors, they who from stupefaction eat different kinds of<br>meat, the man also who sleeps at the foot of a tree, he who keeps any<br>animal matter under his pillow while lying down for sleep, and he who<br>lies down or sleeps placing the head where his feet should be placed or<br>his feet where the head should be placed,&#8212;these men are regarded by us<br>as unclean. Verily, these men have many holes. Those also are numbered in<br>the same class who throw their phlegm and other unclean secretions into<br>the water. Without doubt these men deserve to be slain and eaten up by<br>us. Verily, we afflict those human beings who are given to such conduct.<br>Listen now to what those acts are which are regarded as antidotes and in<br>consequence of which we fail to do any injury to men. Those men upon<br>whose persons occur streaks of Gorochana, or who hold Vachas in their<br>hands, or who make gifts of ghee with those ingredients that go by the<br>name of Akshata, or who place ghee and Akshata on their heads, or those<br>who abstain from meat are incapable of being afflicted by us. That man in<br>whose house the sacred fire burns day and night without being ever put<br>out, or who keeps the skin or teeth of a wolf in his abode or a<br>hill-tortoise, or from whose habitation the sacrificial smoke is seen to<br>curl upwards, or who keeps a cat or a goat that is either tawny or black<br>in hue, is free from our power. Verily, those householders who keep these<br>things in their houses always find them free from the inroads of even the<br>fiercest spirits that live on carrion. Those beings also, that like us<br>range through different worlds in pursuit of pleasure, are unable to do<br>any injury to such houses. Hence, ye deities, should men keep such<br>articles in their houses,&#8212;articles that are destructive of Rakshasas<br>(and other beings of the kind). We have thus told you everything about<br>that respecting which ye had great doubts.'"
