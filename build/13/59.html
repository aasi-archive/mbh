                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Amongst all those gifts that are mentioned in the<br>treatises other than the Vedas, which gift, O chief of Kuru's race, is<br>the most distinguished in thy opinion? O puissant one, great is the<br>curiosity I feel with respect to this matter. Do thou discourse to me<br>also of that gift which follows the giver into the next world.'[317]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'An assurance unto all creatures of love and affection and<br>abstention from every kind of injury, acts of kindness and favour done to<br>a person in distress, gifts of articles made unto one that solicits with<br>thirst and agreeable to the solicitor's wishes, and whatever gifts are<br>made without the giver's ever thinking of them as gifts made by him,<br>constitute, O chief of Bharata's race, the highest and best of gifts.<br>Gift of gold, gift of kine, and gift of earth,&#8212;these are regarded as<br>sin-cleansing. They rescue the giver from his evil acts. O chief of men,<br>do thou always make such gifts unto those that are righteous. Without<br>doubt, gifts rescue the giver from all his sins. That person who wishes<br>to make his gifts eternal should always give unto persons possessed of<br>the requisite qualifications whatever articles are desired by all and<br>whatever things are the best in his house. The man who makes gifts of<br>agreeable things and who does to others what is agreeable to others,<br>always succeeds in obtaining things that are agreeable to himself. Such a<br>person certainly becomes agreeable unto all, both here and hereafter.<br>That man, O Yudhishthira, is a cruel wretch, who, through vanity, does<br>not, to the extent of his means, attend to the wishes of one who is poor<br>and helpless, and who solicits assistance.[318] He is verily the foremost<br>of men who shows favour unto even an helpless enemy fallen into distress<br>when such enemy presents himself and prays for help. No man is equal to<br>him (in merit) who satisfies the hunger of a person that is emaciated,<br>possessed of learning, destitute of the means of support, and weakened by<br>misery. One should always, O son of Kunti, dispel by every means in one's<br>power, the distress of righteous persons observant of vows and acts, who,<br>though destitute of sons and spouses and plunged into misery, do not yet<br>solicit others for any kind of assistance. Those persons who do not utter<br>blessings upon the deities and men (in expectation of gifts), who are<br>deserving of reverence and always contented, and who subsist upon such<br>alms as they get without solicitation of any kind, are regarded as<br>veritable snakes of virulent poison. Do thou, O Bharata, always protect<br>thyself from them by making gifts unto them. They are competent to make<br>the foremost of Ritwikas. Thou art to find them out by means of thy spies<br>and agents.[319] Thou shouldst honour those men by gifts of good houses<br>equipped with every necessary article, with slaves and serving men, with<br>good robes and vestments, O son of Kuru, and with all articles competent<br>to contribute to one's pleasure and happiness. Righteous men of righteous<br>deeds should make such gifts, impelled by the motive that it is their<br>duty to act in that way and not from desire of reaping any rewards<br>therefrom. Verily good men should act in this way so that the virtuous<br>men described above might not, O Yudhishthira, feel any disinclination to<br>accept those gifts sanctified by devotion and faith. There are persons<br>bathed in learning and bathed in vows. Without depending upon anybody<br>they obtain their means of subsistence. These Brahmanas of rigid vows are<br>devoted to Vedic study and penances without proclaiming their practices<br>to any one. Whatever gifts thus mayst make unto those persons of pure<br>behaviour, of thorough mastery over their senses, and always contented<br>with their own wedded spouses in the matter of desire, are sure to win<br>for thee a merit that will accompany thee into all the worlds into which<br>thou mayst go. One reaps the same merit by making gifts unto regenerate<br>persons of restrained souls which one wins by properly pouring libations<br>unto the sacred fire morning and evening. Even this is the sacrifice<br>spread out for thee,&#8212;a sacrifice that is sanctified by devotion and<br>faith and that is endued with Dakshina. It is distinguished above all<br>other sacrifices. Let that sacrifice ceaselessly flow from thee as thou<br>givest away.[320] Performed in view of such men, O Yudhishthira, a<br>sacrifice in which the water that is sprinkled for dedicating gifts<br>constitutes the oblations in honour of the Pitris, and devotion and<br>worship rendered unto such superior men, serves to free one of the debts<br>one owes to the deities.[321] Those persons that do not yield to wrath<br>and that never desire to take even a blade of grass belonging to others,<br>as also they that are of agreeable speech, deserve to receive from us the<br>most reverent worship. Such persons and others (because free from desire)<br>never pay their regards to the giver. Nor do they strive for obtaining<br>gifts. They should, however, be cherished by givers as they cherish their<br>own sons. I bend my head unto them. From them also both Heaven and Hell<br>may become one's.[322] Ritwiks and Purohitas and preceptors, when<br>conversant with the Vedas and when behaving mildly towards disciples,<br>become such. Without doubt, Kshatriya energy loses its force upon a<br>Brahmana when it encounters him. Thinking that thou art a king, that thou<br>art possessed of great power, and that thou hast affluence, do not, O<br>Yudhishthira, enjoy thy affluence without giving anything unto the<br>Brahmanas. Observing the duties of thy own order, do thou worship the<br>Brahmanas with whatever wealth thou hast, O sinless one, for purposes of<br>adornment or sustaining thy power. Let the Brahmanas live in whatever way<br>they like. Thou shouldst always bend thy head unto them with reverence.<br>Let them always rejoice in thee as thy children, living happily and<br>according to their wishes. Who else than thou, O best of the Kurus, is<br>competent to provide the means of subsistence for such Brahmanas as are<br>endued with eternal contentment as are thy well-wishers, and as are<br>gratified by only a little? As women have one eternal duty, in this<br>world, viz., dependence upon and obedient service to their husbands, and<br>as such duty constitutes their only end, even so is the service to<br>Brahmanas Our eternal duty and end. If, at sight of cruelties and other<br>sinful acts in Kshatriyas, the Brahmanas, O son, unhonoured by us,<br>forsake us all, I say, of what use would life be to us, in the absence of<br>all contact with the Brahmanas, especially as we shall then have to drag<br>on our existence without being able to study the Vedas to perform<br>sacrifices, to hope for worlds of bliss hereafter, and to achieve great<br>feats? I shall, in this connection, tell thee what the eternal usage is.<br>In days of yore, O king, the Kshatriyas used to serve the Brahmanas. The<br>Vaisya in a similar manner used in those days to worship the royal order,<br>and the Sudra to worship the Vaisya. Even this is what is heard. The<br>Brahmana was like a blazing fire. Without being able to touch him or<br>approach his presence, the Sudra used to serve the Brahmana from a<br>distance. It was only the Kshatriya and the Vaisya who could serve the<br>Brahmana by touching his person or approaching his presence. The<br>Brahmanas are endued with a mild disposition. They are truthful in<br>behaviour. They are followers of the true religion. When angry, they are<br>like snakes of virulent poison. Such being their nature, do thou, O<br>Yudhishthira, serve and attend upon them with obedience and reverence.<br>The Brahmanas are superior to even those that are higher than the high<br>and the low. The energy and penances of even those Kshatriyas who blaze<br>forth with energy and might, become powerless and neutralised when they<br>come in contact with the Brahmanas. My sire himself is not dearer to me<br>than the Brahmanas. My mother is not dearer to me than they. My<br>grandsire, O king, is not dearer, my own self is not dearer, my life<br>itself is not dearer, O king, to me than the Brahmanas! On earth there is<br>nothing, O Yudhishthira, that is dearer to me than thou. But, O chief of<br>Bharata's race, the Brahmanas are dearer to me than even thou. I tell<br>thee truly, O son of Pandu! I swear by this truth, by which I hope to<br>acquire all those regions of bliss that have been Santanu's. I behold<br>those sacred regions with Brahma shining conspicuously before them. I<br>shall repair thither, O son, and reside in them for unending days.<br>Beholding these regions, O best of the Bharatas (with my spiritual eyes),<br>I am filled with delight at the thought of all these acts which I have<br>done in aid and honour of the Brahmanas, O monarch!'"
