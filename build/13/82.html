                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I have heard that the dung of the cow is endued with<br>Sree. I desire to hear how this has been brought about. I have doubts, O<br>grandsire, which thou shouldst dispel.'[381]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old story, O monarch, of<br>the conversation between kine and Sree, O best of the Bharatas! Once on a<br>time the goddess Sree, assuming a very beautiful form, entered a herd of<br>kine. The kine, beholding her wealth of beauty, became filled with<br>wonder.'<br><br>"The kine said, 'Who art thou, O goddess? Whence hast thou become<br>unrivalled on earth for beauty? O highly blessed goddess, we have been<br>filled with wonder at thy wealth of beauty. We desire to know who thou<br>art. Who, indeed, art thou? Whither wilt thou proceed? O thou of very<br>superior splendour of complexion, do tell us in detail all we wish to<br>know.'<br><br>"Sri said, 'Blessed be ye, I am dear unto all creatures. Indeed, I am<br>known by the name of Sri. Forsaken by me, the Daityas have been lost for<br>ever. The deities, viz., Indra, Vivaswat, Soma, Vishnu, Varuna, and Agni,<br>having obtained me, are sporting in joy and will do so for ever. Verily,<br>the Rishis and the deities, only when they are endued with me, have<br>success. Ye kine, those beings meet with destruction into whom I do not<br>enter. Religion, wealth, and pleasure, only when endued with me, become<br>sources of happiness. Ye kine who are givers of happiness, know that I am<br>possessed of even such energy! I wish to always reside in every one of<br>you. Repairing to your presence, I solicit you. Be all of you endued with<br>Sri.<br><br>"The kine said, 'Thou art fickle and restless. Thou sufferest thyself to<br>be enjoyed by many persons. We do not desire to have thee. Blessed be<br>thou, go wheresoever thou pleasest. As regards ourselves, all of us are<br>possessed of good forms. What need have we with thee? Go wheresoever thou<br>likest. Thou hast already (by answering our questions) gratified us<br>exceedingly.'<br><br>"Sri said, 'Is it proper with you, ye kine that you do not welcome me? I<br>am difficult of being attained. Why then do you not accept me? It seems,<br>ye creatures of excellent vows, that the popular proverb is true, viz.,<br>that it is certain that when one come to another of one's own accord and<br>without being sought, one meets with disregard. The Gods, the Danavas,<br>the Gandharvas, the Pisachas, the Uragas, the Rakshasas and human beings<br>succeed in obtaining me only after undergoing the severest austerities.<br>You who have such energy, do ye take me. Ye amiable ones, I am never<br>disregarded by any one in the three worlds of mobile and immobile<br>creatures.'<br><br>"The kine said, 'We do not disregard thee, O goddess. We do not show thee<br>a slight! Thou art fickle and of a very restless heart. It is for this<br>only that we take leave of thee. What need of much talk? Do thou go<br>wheresoever thou choosest. All of us are endued with excellent forms.<br>What need have we with thee, O sinless one?'<br><br>"Sri said, 'Ye givers of honours, cast off by you in this way, I shall<br>certainly be an object of disregard with all the world. Do ye show me<br>grace. Ye are all highly blessed. Ye are ever ready to grant protection<br>unto those that seek your protection. I have come to you soliciting your<br>protection. I have no fault. Do you rescue me (from this situation). Know<br>that I shall always be devoted to you. I am desirous of residing in any<br>parts, however repulsive, of your bodies. Indeed, I wish to reside in<br>even your rectum. Ye sinless ones, I do not see that ye have any part in<br>your bodies that may be regarded as repulsive, for ye are sacred, and<br>sanctifying, and highly blessed. Do ye, however, grant my prayer. Do ye<br>tell me in which part, of your bodies I shall take up my residence.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by Sri, the kine, always auspicious<br>and inclined to kindness unto all who are devoted to them, took counsel<br>with one another, and then addressing Sri, and unto her, O king, these<br>words.'<br><br>"The kine said, 'O thou of great fame, it is certainly desirable that we<br>should honour thee. Do thou live in our urine and dung. Both these are<br>sacred, O auspicious goddess!<br><br>"Sri said, 'By good luck, ye have shown me much grace implying your<br>desire to favour me. Let it be even as ye say! Blessed be ye all, I have<br>really been honoured by you, ye givers of happiness!<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Having, O Bharata, made this compact with the kine,<br>Sri, there and then, in the very sight of those kine, rendered herself<br>invisible. I have thus told thee, O son, the glory of the dung of kine, I<br>shall once again discourse to thee on the glory of kine. Do thou listen<br>to me."
