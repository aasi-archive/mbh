                            "The god of wind said, 'Hear, O deluded man, what the attributes are that<br>belong to Brahmanas all of whom are endued with high souls. The Brahmana<br>is superior to all those which, O king, thou hast named! In days of yore,<br>the earth, indulging in a spirit of rivalry with the kind of the Angas,<br>forsook her character as Earth. The regenerate Kasyapa caused destruction<br>to overtake her by actually paralysing her. The Brahmanas are always<br>unconquerable, O king, in heaven as also on earth. In days of yore, the<br>great Rishi Angiras, through his energy, drank off all the waters. The<br>high-souled Rishi, having drank off all the waters as if they were milk,<br>did not feel yet his thirst to be slaked. He, therefore, once more caused<br>the earth to be filled with water by raising a mighty wave. On another<br>occasion, when Angiras became enraged with me, I fled away, leaving the<br>world, and dwelt for a long time concealed in the Agnihotra of the<br>Brahmanas through fear of that Rishi. The illustrious Purandara, in<br>consequence of his having coveted the body of Ahalya, was cursed by<br>Gautama, yet, for the sake of Righteousness and wealth, the Rishi did not<br>destroy outright the chief of the deities. The Ocean, O king, that was<br>full in former days of crystal water, cursed by the Brahmanas, became<br>saline in taste.[608] Even Agni who is of the complexion of gold, and who<br>blazes with effulgence when destitute of smoke, and whose flames uniting<br>together burn upwards, when cursed by the angry Angiras, became divested<br>of all these attributes.[609] Behold, the sixty thousand sons of Sagara,<br>who came here to adore the Ocean, have all been pulverised by the<br>Brahmana. Kapila of golden complexion. Thou art not equal to the<br>Brahmanas. Do thou, O king, seek thy own good. The Kshatriya of even<br>great puissance bows to Brahmana children that are still in their<br>mothers' wombs. The large kingdom of the Dandakas was destroyed by a<br>Brahmana. The mighty Kshatriya Talajangala was destroyed by a single<br>Brahmana. viz., Aurva. Thou too hast acquired a large kingdom, great<br>might, religious merit, and learning, which are all difficult of<br>attainment, through the grace of Dattatreya. Why dost thou, O Arjuna,<br>worship Agni everyday who is a Brahmana? He is the bearer of sacrificial<br>libations from every part of the universe. Art thou ignorant of this<br>fact? Why, indeed, dost thou suffer thyself to be stupefied by folly when<br>thou art not ignorant of the fact that a superior Brahmana is the<br>protector of all creatures in the world and is, indeed, the creator of<br>the living world? The Lord of all creatures, Brahman, unmanifest, endued<br>with puissance, and of unfading glory, who created this boundless<br>universe with its mobile and immobile creatures (is a Brahman). Some<br>persons there are, destitute of wisdom, who say that Brahman was born of<br>an Egg. From the original Egg, when it burst forth, mountains and the<br>points of the compass and the waters and the earth and the heavens all<br>sprang forth into existence. This birth of the creation was not seen by<br>any one. How then can Brahman be said to have taken his birth from the<br>original Egg, when especially he is declared as Unborn? It is said that<br>vast uncreate Space is the original Egg. It was from this uncreate Space<br>(or Supreme Brahman) that the Grandsire was born. If thou askest,<br>'Whereon would the Grandsire, after his birth from uncreate Space, rest,<br>for there was then nothing else?' The answer may be given in the<br>following words, 'There is an existent Being of the name of<br>Consciousness. That mighty Being is endued with great energy. There is no<br>Egg. Brahman, however, is existent. He is the creator of the universe and<br>is its king! Thus addressed by the god of wind, king Arjuna remained<br>silent.'"[610]
