                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, in what kind of man or woman,<br>O chief of the Bharatas, does the goddess of prosperity always reside?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall, in this connection, narrate to thee what<br>occurred and what I have heard. Once on a time, beholding the goddess of<br>prosperity blazing with beauty and endued with the complexion of the<br>lotus, the princess Rukmini the mother of Pradyumna that bore the device<br>of the Makara on his banner, filled with curiosity, asked this question<br>in the presence of Devaki's son. Who are those beings by whose side thou<br>stayest and whom thou favours? Who again, are those whom thou dost not<br>bless with favour. O thou that art dear unto Him that is the lord of all<br>creatures, tell me this truly, O thou that art equal to a great Rishi in<br>penances and puissance. Thus addressed by the princess, the goddess of<br>prosperity, with a face as beautiful as the moon, and moved by grace, in<br>the presence of him who has Garuda on his banner, said these words in<br>reply that were sweet and charming.'<br><br>"Sree said, 'O blessed lady, I always reside with him that is eloquent,<br>active, attentive to business, free from wrath, given to the worship of<br>the deities, endued with gratitude, has his passions under complete<br>control, and is high-minded in everything. I never reside with one that<br>is inattentive to business, that is an unbeliever, that causes an<br>intermixture of races in consequence of his lustfulness, that is<br>ungrateful, that is of impure practices, that uses harsh and cruel words,<br>that is a thief, that cherishes malice towards his preceptors and other<br>seniors, those persons that are endued with little energy, strength,<br>life, and honour, that are distressed at every trifle, and that always<br>indulge in wrath. I never reside with these that think in one strain and<br>act in a different one.[28] I never reside also with him who never<br>desires any acquisition for himself, of him who is so blinded as to rest<br>content with the lot in which he finds himself without any exertion or<br>with those that are contented with small acquisitions. I reside with<br>those that are observant of the duties of their own order, or those that<br>are conversant with the duties of righteousness, or those that are<br>devoted to the service of the aged or those that have their passions<br>under control, or those that are endued with cleansed souls or those that<br>observe the virtue of forgiveness, or those that are able and prompt in<br>action, or with such women as are forgiving and self-restrained. I reside<br>with those women also that are devoted to truth and sincerity and that<br>worship the deities. I do not reside with those women also that do not<br>attend to household furniture and provisions scattered all around the<br>house, and that always utter words contrary to the wishes of their<br>husbands. I always avoid those women that are fond of the houses of other<br>people and that have no modesty. On the other hand, I reside with those<br>women that are devoted to their husbands, that are blessed in behaviour,<br>and that are always decked in ornaments and attired in good robes. I<br>always reside with those women that are truthful in speech, that are of<br>handsome and agreeable features, that are blessed and that are endued<br>with all accomplishments. I always avoid such women as are sinful and<br>unclean or impure, as always lick the corners of their mouths, as have no<br>patience or fortitude, and as are fond of dispute and quarrelling, as are<br>given to much sleep, and as always lie down. I always reside in<br>conveyances and the animals that drag them, in maidens, in ornaments and<br>good vestments, in sacrifices, in clouds charged with rain, in full-blown<br>lotuses, and in those stars that bespangle the autumnal firmament. I<br>reside in elephants, in the cow pen, in good seats, and in lakes adorned<br>with full-blown lotuses. I live also in such rivers as babble sweetly in<br>their course, melodious with the music of cranes, having banks adorned<br>with rows of diverse trees, and restored to by Brahmanas and ascetics and<br>others crowned with success. I always reside in those rivers also that<br>have deep and large volumes of rolling waters rendered turbid by lions<br>and elephants plunging into them for bathing or slaking their thirst. I<br>reside also in infuriate elephants, in bovine bulls, in kings, on the<br>throne and good men. I always reside in that house in which the inmate<br>pours libation on the sacrificial fire and worships kine, Brahmanas and<br>the deities. I reside in that house where at the proper time offerings<br>are made unto the deities, in course of worship.[29] I always reside in<br>such Brahmanas as are devoted to the study of the Vedas, in Kshatriyas<br>devoted to the observance of righteousness, in Vaisyas devoted to<br>cultivation, and the Sudras devoted to the (menial) service of the three<br>upper classes. I reside, with a heart firm and unchangeable, in Narayana,<br>in my embodied self. In Him is righteousness in its perfection and full<br>measure, devotion to the Brahmanas, and the quality of agreeableness. Can<br>I not say, O lady that I do not reside in my embodied form, (in any of<br>these places that I have mentioned, except Narayana)? That person in whom<br>I reside in spirit increases in righteousness and fame and wealth and<br>objects of desire.'"
