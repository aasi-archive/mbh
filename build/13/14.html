                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O son of the River Ganga, thou hast heard all the<br>names of Maheshwara, the Lord of the universe. Do thou tell us, O<br>grandsire, all the names that are applied, O puissant one, unto Him who<br>is called Isa and Sambhu. Do thou tell us all those names that are<br>applied unto Him who is called Vabhru or vast, Him that has the universe<br>for his form, Him that is the illustrious preceptor of all the deities<br>and the Asuras, that is called Swayambhu (self-creating) and that is the<br>cause of the origin and dissolution of the universe. Do thou tell us also<br>of the puissance of Mahadeva.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I am quite incompetent to recite the virtues of Mahadeva<br>of highest intelligence. He pervades all things in the universe and yet<br>is not seen anywhere. He is the creator of universal self and the Pragna<br>(knowing) self and he is their master. All the deities, from Brahman to<br>the Pisachas, adore and worship him. He transcends both Prakriti and<br>Purusha. It is of Him that Rishis, conversant with Yoga and possessing a<br>knowledge of the tattwas, think and reflect. He is indestructible and<br>Supreme Brahman. He is both existent and non-existent. Agitating both<br>Prakriti and Purusha by means of His energy, He created therefrom the<br>universal lord of creatures, viz., Brahma. Who is there that is competent<br>to tell the virtues of that god of gods, that is endued with supreme<br>Intelligence? Man is subject to conception (in the mother's womb), birth,<br>decrepitude, and death. Being such, what man like me is competent to<br>understand Bhava? Only Narayana, O son, that bearer of the discus and the<br>mace, can comprehend Mahadeva. He is without deterioration. He is the<br>foremost of all beings in attributes. He is Vishnu, because of his<br>pervading the universe. He is irresistible. Endued with spiritual vision,<br>He is possessed of supreme Energy. He sees all things with the eye of<br>Yoga. It is in consequence of the devotion of the high-souled Krishna to<br>the illustrious Rudra whom he gratified. O Bharata, in the retreat of<br>Vadari, by penances, that he has succeeded in pervading the entire<br>universe. O king of kings, it is through Maheswara of celestial vision<br>that Vasudeva has obtained the attribute of universal agreeableness,&#8212;an<br>agreeableness that is much greater than what is possessed by all articles<br>included under the name of wealth.[32] For a full thousand years this<br>Madhava underwent the austerest penances and at last succeeded in<br>gratifying the illustrious and boon giving Siva, that Master of all the<br>mobile and the immobile universe. In every new Yuga has Krishna (by such<br>penances) gratified Mahadeva. In every Yuga has Mahadeva been gratified<br>with the great devotion of the high-souled Krishna. How great is the<br>puissance of the high-souled Mahadeva,&#8212;that original cause of the<br>universe,&#8212;has been seen with his own eyes by Hari who himself transcends<br>all deterioration, on the occasion of his penances in the retreat of<br>Vadari undergone for obtaining a son.[33] I do not, O Bharata, behold any<br>one that is superior to Mahadeva. To expound the names of that god of<br>gods fully and without creating the desire of hearing more only Krishna<br>is competent. This mighty-armed one of Yadu's race is alone competent to<br>tell the attributes of the illustrious Siva. Verily, O king, only he is<br>able to discourse on the puissance, in its entirety of the Supreme deity?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said these words, the illustrious<br>Bhishma, the grandsire of the Kurus, addressing Vasudeva, said the<br>following words, dealing with the subject of the greatness of Bhava, O<br>monarch.<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Thou art the Master of all the deities and the Asuras.<br>Thou art illustrious. Thou art Vishnu in consequence of thy pervading the<br>whole universe. It behoveth thee to discourse on those subjects connected<br>with Siva of universal form about which Yudhishthira has asked me. In<br>days of yore, the Rishi Tandin, sprung from Brahma, recited in Brahma's<br>region and before Brahma himself the thousand names of Mahadeva. Do thou<br>recite those names before this conclave so that these Rishis endued with<br>wealth of asceticism, observant of high vows, possessed of<br>self-restraint, and numbering the Island-born Krishna among them, may<br>hear thee. Do thou discourse on the high blessedness of Him who is<br>immutable, who is always cheerful and happy, who is Hotri, who is the<br>universal Protector, who is Creator, of the universe, and who is called<br>Mundin and Kaparddin.'[34]<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'The very deities with Indra, and the Grandsire Brahma<br>numbering among them, and the great Rishis also, are incompetent to<br>understand the course of Mahadeva's acts truly and in all their details.<br>Even He is the end which all righteous people attain. The very Adityas<br>who are endued with subtile sight, are unable to behold his abode. How<br>then can one that is merely a man succeed in comprehending Him?[35] I<br>shall, therefore, truly recite to you some of the attributes of that<br>illustrious slayer of Asuras, who is regarded as the Lord of all<br>sacrifices and vows.<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said these words, the illustrious<br>Vasudeva began his discourse on the attributes of the high-souled<br>Mahadeva endued with the highest intelligence, after having purified<br>himself by touching water."<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'Hear, ye foremost of Brahmana's and thou Yudhishthira<br>also, O sire, and hear thou too, O Ganga's son, the names that are<br>applied unto Kaparddin. Hear ye, how in former days, I obtained a sight,<br>so difficult to obtain, (of that great god), for the sake of Samva.<br>Verily, in those days was the illustrious deity seen by me in consequence<br>of Yoga-abstraction.[36] After twelve years had expired from the time<br>when Pradyumna, the son of Rukmini, who is endued with great<br>intelligence, slew the Asura Samvara in days of yore, my spouse Jamvavati<br>addressed me. Indeed, beholding Pradyumna and Charudeshna and other sons<br>born of Rukmini, Jamvavati, desirous of a son, said these words unto me,<br>O Yudhishthira,&#8212;Grant me, O thou of unfading glory, a son endued with<br>heroism, the foremost of mighty men, possessed of the most agreeable<br>features, sinless in conduct, and like unto thyself. And O, let there be<br>no delay on thy part in granting this prayer of mine. There is nothing in<br>the three worlds that is unattainable by thee, O perpetuator of Yadu's<br>race, thou canst create other worlds if only thou wishest it. Observing a<br>vow for twelve years and purifying thyself, thou hadst adored the Lord of<br>all creatures (viz., Mahadeva) and then begot upon Rukmini the sons that<br>she has obtained from thee, viz., Charudeshna and Sucharu and Charuvesa<br>and Yasodhana and Charusravas and Charuyasas and Pradyumna and Sambhu. O<br>slayer of Madhu, do thou grant to me a son like unto those of great<br>powers whom thou hast begotten upon Rukmini?&#8212;Thus addressed by the<br>princess, I replied unto her of slender waist,&#8212;Let me have thy<br>permission (to leave thee for some time), O queen. I shall certainly obey<br>thy behest. She answered me, saying,&#8212;Go, and may success and prosperity<br>always attend thee. Let Brahma and Siva and Kasyapa, the Rivers, those<br>deities that preside over the mind, the soil, all deciduous herbs, those<br>Chhandas (Rhymes) that are regarded as bearers of the libations poured in<br>sacrifices, the Rishis, Earth, the Oceans, the sacrificial presents,<br>those syllables that are uttered for completing the cadences of Samans,<br>the Rikshas, the Pitris, the Planets, the spouses of the deities, the<br>celestial maidens, the celestial mothers, the great cycles, kine,<br>Chandramas, Savitri, Agni, Savitri, the knowledge of the Vedas, the<br>seasons, the year, small and big divisions of time, e.g., the Kshanas,<br>the Labas, the Muhurtas, the Nimeshas, and the Yugas in succession,<br>protect thee, O Yadava, and keep thee in happiness, wherever thou mayst<br>stay. Let no danger overtake thee on thy way, and let no heedlessness be<br>thine, O sinless one.&#8212;Thus blessed by her, I took her leave, bidding<br>farewell unto the daughter of the prince of apes. Repairing then into the<br>presence of that foremost of men, viz., my father, of my mother, of the<br>king, and of Ahuka, I informed them of what the daughter of the prince of<br>the Vidyadharas, in great affliction, had said unto me. Bidding them<br>farewell with a sorrowful heart, I then repaired to Gada and to Rama of<br>great might. These two cheerfully addressed me saying,&#8212;Let thy penances<br>increase without any obstruction.&#8212;Having obtained the permission of all<br>of them, I thought of Garuda. He immediately came to me and bore me to<br>Himavat (at my bidding). Arrived at Himavat, I dismissed him. There on<br>that foremost of mountains, I beheld many wonderful sights. I saw an<br>excellent, wonderful, and agreeable retreat for the practice of penances.<br>That delightful retreat was owned by the high-souled Upamanyu who was a<br>descendant of Vyaghrapada. That retreat is applauded and reverenced by<br>the deities and the Gandharvas, and seemed to be covered with Vedic<br>beauty. It was adorned with Dhavas and Kakubhas and Kadamvas and Cocas,<br>with Kuruvakas and Ketakas and Jamvus and Patalas, with banians and<br>Varunakas and Vatsanabhas and Vilwas, with Saralas and Kapitthas and<br>Piyalas and Salas and palmyras with Vadaris and Kundas and Punnagas and<br>Asokas and Amras and Kovidaras and Champakas and Panasas, and with<br>diverse other trees endued with fruits and flowers. And that retreat was<br>also decked with the straight stems of the Musa Supienta.[37] Truly, that<br>asylum was adorned with diverse other kinds of trees and with diverse<br>kinds of fruits forming the food of diverse kinds of birds. Heaps of<br>ashes (of sacrificial fires) were thrown in proper places all around,<br>which added to the beauty of the scene. It abounded with Rurus and apes<br>and tigers and lions and leopards, with deer of diverse species and<br>peacocks, and with cats and snakes. Indeed, large numbers of other<br>animals also were seen there, as also buffaloes and bears. Delicious<br>breezes constantly blew bearing the melodious strains of celestial<br>nymphs. The babblings of mountain rivulets and springs, the sweet notes<br>of winged choristers, the gruntings of elephants, the delicious stains of<br>Kinnaras, and the auspicious voice of ascetics singing the Samans, O<br>hero, and diverse other kinds of music, rendered that retreat extremely<br>charming. The very imagination cannot conceive another retreat as<br>delightful as the one I beheld. There were also large houses in that<br>asylum, intended for keeping the sacred fire, and covered all over with<br>flowering creepers. It was adorned with the river Ganga of clear and<br>sacred water. Indeed, the daughter of Jahnu always remained there. It was<br>decked also with many ascetics who were the foremost of all righteous<br>persons, who were endued with high souls, and who resembled fire itself<br>in energy.[38] Some of those ascetics subsisted upon air and some upon<br>water, some were devoted to Japa or the silent recitation of sacred<br>Mantras, and some were engaged in cleansing their souls by practising the<br>virtues of compassion while some amongst them were Yogins devoted to the<br>abstraction of Yoga-meditation. Some amongst them subsisted upon smoke<br>only, and some subsisted upon fire, and some upon milk. Thus was that<br>retreat adorned with many foremost of regenerate persons. And some there<br>were amongst them that had taken the vow of eating and drinking like<br>kine,&#8212;that is, by giving up the use of the hands at once. And some used<br>only two pieces of stone for husking their grain, and some used their<br>teeth only for that purpose. And some subsisted by drinking only the rays<br>of the moon, and some by drinking only froth. And some had betaken<br>themselves to vow of living like deer.[39] And some there were that lived<br>upon the fruits of the Ficus religiosa, and some that used to live upon<br>water. And some dressed themselves in rags and some in animal skins and<br>some in barks of trees. Indeed, I beheld diverse ascetics of the foremost<br>order observing these and other painful vows. I desired then to enter<br>that asylum. Verily, that asylum was honoured and adored by the deities<br>and all high-souled beings, by Siva and others, O Bharata, and by all<br>creatures of righteous acts. Thus addressed, it stood in all its beauty<br>on the breast of Himavat, like the lunar disc in the firmament. The<br>mongoose sported there with the snake, and the tiger with the deer, like<br>friends, forgetting their natural enmity, in consequence of the energy of<br>those ascetics of blazing penances and for their proximity to these<br>high-souled ones. In that foremost of asylums, which was delightful to<br>all creatures, inhabited by many foremost of Brahmanas fully conversant<br>with the Vedas and their branches, and by many high-souled Rishis<br>celebrated for the difficult vows they observed, I saw, as soon as I<br>entered, a puissant Rishi with matted locks on head and dressed in rags,<br>who seemed to blaze forth like fire with his penances and energy. Waited<br>upon by his disciples and possessed of tranquil soul, that foremost of<br>Brahmanas was young in aspect. His name was Upamanyu. Unto me who bowed<br>unto him with a nod of the head, he said,&#8212;Welcome art thou, O thou of<br>eyes like lotus petals. Today, by this visit of thine, we see that our<br>penances have borne fruit. Thou art worthy of our adoration, but thou<br>adorest us still. Thou art worthy of being seen, but thou desirest to see<br>me.&#8212;Joining my hands I addressed him the usual enquiries respecting the<br>well-being of the animals and birds that resided in his asylum, of the<br>progress of his righteousness, and of his disciples. The illustrious<br>Upamanyu then addressed me in words that were exceedingly sweet and<br>delightful,&#8212;Thou shalt, O Krishna, obtain without doubt a son like unto<br>thyself. Betaking thyself to severe penances, do thou gratify Isana, the<br>Lord of all creatures. That divine Master, O Adhokshaja, sporteth here<br>with his spouse by his side. O Janarddana, it was here that the deities<br>with all the Rishis, in days of yore, gratified that foremost of deities<br>by their penances and Brahmacharyya and truth and self-restraint, and<br>succeeded in obtaining the fruition of many high desires. That<br>illustrious god is verily the vast receptacle of all energies and<br>penances. Projecting into existence and withdrawing once more unto<br>himself all things fraught with good and evil, that inconceivable Deity<br>whom thou seekest, O destroyer of foes, lives here with his spouse. He<br>who took his birth as the Danava named Hiranyakashipu, whose strength was<br>so great that he could shake the very mountains of Meru, succeeded in<br>obtaining from Mahadeva the puissance belonging to all the deities and<br>enjoyed it for ten millions of years. He who was the foremost of all his<br>sons and who was celebrated by the name of Mandara, succeeded, through<br>the boon he had obtained from Mahadeva, in fighting Sakra for a million<br>of years. The terrible discus of Vishnu and the thunderbolt of Indra were<br>both unable to make the slightest impression, O Kesava, in days of yore,<br>upon the body of that great cause of universal affliction.[40] The discus<br>which thou bearest, O sinless one, was given unto thee by Mahadeva after<br>he had slain a Daitya that was proud of his strength and used to live<br>within the waters. That discus, blazing with energy and like unto fire,<br>was created by the great god having for his device the bull. Wonderful<br>and irresistible in energy it was given unto thee by that illustrious<br>god. In consequence of its blazing energy it was incapable of being gazed<br>at by any person save Siva the wielder of Pinaka. It was for this reason<br>that Bhava (Siva) bestowed upon it the name of Sudarsana. From that time<br>the name Sudarsana came to be current in all the worlds. Even the weapon,<br>O Kesava, failed to make the slightest impression on the body of<br>Hiranyakashipu's son Mandara, that appeared like an evil planet in the<br>three worlds. Hundreds of Chakras like thine and thunderbolts like that<br>of Sakra, could not inflict a scratch on the body of that evil planet<br>endued with great might, who had obtained a boon from Mahadeva. Afflicted<br>by the mighty Mandara, the deities fought hard against him and his<br>associates, all of whom had obtained boons from Mahadeva. Gratified with<br>another Danava named Vidyutprabha, Mahadeva granted to him the<br>sovereignty of the three worlds. That Danava remained the sovereign of<br>the three worlds for a hundred thousand years. And Mahadeva said unto<br>him,&#8212;Thou shalt become one of my attendants.&#8212;Indeed, the puissant Lord<br>further bestowed upon him the boon of a hundred millions of children. The<br>Master without birth, of all creatures further gave the Danava the region<br>known by the name of Kusadwipa for his kingdom. Another great Asura, of<br>the name of Satamukha, was created by Brahma. For a hundred years he<br>poured on' the sacrificial fire (as offerings unto Mahadeva) the flesh of<br>his own body. Gratified with such penances, Sankara said unto him,&#8212;What<br>can I do for thee?&#8212;Satamukha replied unto him, saying,&#8212;O thou that art<br>most wonderful, let me have the power of creating new creatures and<br>animals. Give also unto me, O foremost of all deities, eternal<br>power.&#8212;The puissant lord, thus addressed by him, said unto him,&#8212;So be<br>it.&#8212;The Self-born Brahma, concentrating his mind in Yoga,[41] in days of<br>yore, made a sacrifice for three hundred years, with the object of<br>obtaining children. Mahadeva granted him a thousand sons possessed of<br>qualifications commensurate with the merits of the sacrifice. Without<br>doubt, thou knowest, O Krishna, the lord of Yoga, him that is, who is<br>sung by the deities. The Rishi known by the name of Yajnavalkya is<br>exceedingly virtuous. By adoring Mahadeva he has acquired great fame. The<br>great ascetic who is Parasara's son, viz., Vyasa, of soul set on Yoga,<br>has obtained great celebrity by adoring Sankara. The Valikhilyas were on<br>a former occasion disregarded by Maghavat. Filled with wrath at this,<br>they gratified the illustrious Rudra. That lord of the universe, that<br>foremost one of all the deities, thus gratified by the Valikhilyas, said<br>unto them,&#8212;Ye shall succeed by your penances in creating a bird that<br>will rob Indra of the Amrita. Through the wrath of Mahadeva on a former<br>occasion, all the waters disappeared. The deities gratified him by<br>performing a sacrifice called Saptakapala, and caused, through his grace,<br>other waters to flow into the worlds. Verily, when the three-eyed deity<br>became gratified, water once more appeared in the world. The wife of<br>Atri, who was conversant with the Vedas, abandoned her husband in a huff<br>and said,&#8212;I shall no longer live in subjection to that ascetic.&#8212;Having<br>said these words, she sought the protection of Mahadeva. Through fear of<br>her lord, Atri, passed three hundred years, abstaining from all food. And<br>all this time she slept on wooden clubs for the purpose of gratifying<br>Bhava. The great deity then appeared unto her and then smilingly<br>addressed her, saying&#8212;Thou shalt obtain a son. And thou shalt get that<br>son without the need of a husband, simply through the grace of Rudra.<br>Without doubt that son, born in the race of his father, shall become<br>celebrated for his worth, and assume a name after thee. The illustrious<br>Vikarna also, O slayer of Madhu, full of devotion to Mahadeva, gratified<br>him with severe penances and obtained high and happy success. Sakalya,<br>too, of restrained soul, adored Bhava in a mental sacrifice that he<br>performed for nine hundred years, O Kesava. Gratified with him the<br>illustrious deity said unto him,&#8212;Thou shalt become a great author. O<br>son, inexhaustible shall thy fame be in the three worlds. Thy race also<br>shall never come to an end and shall be adorned by many great Rishis that<br>shall take birth in it. Thy son will become the foremost of Brahmanas and<br>will make the Sutras of thy work. There was a celebrated Rishi of the<br>name of Savarni in the Krita age. Here, in this asylum, he underwent<br>severe penances for six thousand years. The illustrious Rudra said,&#8212;I am<br>gratified with thee, O sinless one! Without being subject to decrepitude<br>or death, thou shalt become an author celebrated through all the<br>worlds!&#8212;In days of yore, Sakra, also, in Baranasi, filled with devotion,<br>O Janarddana, adored Mahadeva who has empty space alone for his garments<br>and who is smeared with ashes as an agreeable unguent. Having adored<br>Mahadeva thus, he obtained the sovereignty of the celestials. Narada<br>also, in days of yore, adored the great Bhava with devotion of heart.<br>Gratified with him, Mahadeva, that preceptor of the celestial preceptor,<br>said these words.&#8212;No one shall be thy equal in energy and penances. Thou<br>shalt always attend upon me with thy songs and instrumental music. Hear<br>also, O Madhava, how in former times I succeeded in obtaining a sight of<br>that god of gods, that Master of all creatures, O Lord. Hear also in<br>detail for what object, O thou of great puissance. I invoked with<br>restrained senses and mind that illustrious deity endued with supreme<br>energy. I shall, O sinless one, tell thee with full details all that I<br>succeeded in obtaining from that god of gods, viz., Maheswara. In ancient<br>times, viz., Krita age, O son, there was a Rishi of great fame, named<br>Vyaghrapada. He was celebrated for his knowledge and mastery over the<br>Vedas and their branches. I was born as the son of that Rishi and Dhaumya<br>took birth as my younger brother. On a certain occasion, Madhava,<br>accompanied by Dhaumya, I came upon the asylum of certain Rishis of<br>cleansed souls. There I beheld a cow that was being milked. I saw the<br>milk and it appeared to me to resemble Amrita itself in taste. I then<br>came home, and impelled by childishness, I addressed my mother and<br>said,&#8212;Give me some food prepared with milk.&#8212;There was no milk in the<br>house, and accordingly my mother was much grieved at my asking for it. My<br>mother took a piece of (rice) cake and boiled it in water, Madhava. The<br>water became whitened and my mother placed it before us saying that it<br>was milk and bade us drink it. I had before that drunk milk on one<br>occasion, for my father had, at the time of a sacrifice, taken me to the<br>residence of some of our great kinsmen. A celestial cow, who delights the<br>deities, was being milked on that occasion. Drinking her milk that<br>resembled Amrita in taste, I knew what the virtues are of milk. I<br>therefore, at once understood the origin of the substance that my mother<br>offered me, telling me that it was milk. Verily, the taste of that cake,<br>O son, did not afford me any pleasure whatever. Impelled by childishness<br>I then addressed mother, saying,&#8212;This O mother, that thou hast given me<br>is not any preparation of milk.&#8212;Filled with grief and sorrow at this,<br>and embracing me from parental affection and smelling my head, O Madhava,<br>she said unto me,&#8212;Whence, O child, can ascetics of cleansed souls obtain<br>food prepared with milk? Such men always reside in the forest and subsist<br>upon bulbs and roots and fruits. Whence shall we who live by the banks of<br>rivers that are the resort of the Valikhilyas, we who have mountains and<br>forest, for our home,&#8212;whence, indeed, O child, shall we obtain milk? We,<br>dear child, live (sometimes) on air and sometimes on water. We dwell in<br>asylums in the midst of forests and woods. We habitually abstain from all<br>kinds of food that are taken by persons living in villages and towns. We<br>are accustomed to only such food as is supplied by the produce of the<br>wilderness. There cannot be any milk, O child, in the wilderness where<br>there are no offspring of Surabhi.[42] Dwelling on the banks of rivers or<br>in caves or on mountain-breasts, or in tirthas and other places of the<br>kind, we pass our time in the practice of penances and the recitation of<br>sacred Mantras, Siva being our highest refuge. Without gratifying the<br>boon-giving Sthanu of unfading glory,&#8212;him, that is, who has three<br>eyes,&#8212;whence, O child, can one obtain food prepared with milk and good<br>robes and other objects of enjoyment in the world? Do thou devote<br>thyself, O dear son, to Sankara with thy whole soul. Through his grace, O<br>child, thou art sure to obtain all such objects as administer to the<br>indulgence of all thy wishes,&#8212;Hearing these words of my mother, O slayer<br>of foes, that day, I joined my hands in reverence and bowing unto her,<br>said,&#8212;O mother, who this Mahadeva? In what manner can one gratify him?<br>Where does that god reside? How may he be seen? With what does he become<br>pleased? What also is the form of Sarva? How may one succeed in obtaining<br>a knowledge of him? If gratified, will he, O mother, show himself unto<br>me?&#8212;After I had said these words, O Krishna, to my mother, she, filled<br>with parental affection, smelt my head, O Govinda, her eyes covered with<br>tears the while. Gently patting my body, O slayer of Madhu, my mother,<br>adopting a tone of great humility, addressed me in the following words, O<br>best of the deities.'<br><br>"My mother said, 'Mahadeva is exceedingly difficult to be known by<br>persons of uncleansed souls. These men are incapable of bearing him in<br>their hearts of comprehending him at all. They can retain him in their<br>minds. They cannot seize him, nor can they obtain a sight of him. Men of<br>wisdom aver that his forms are many. Many, again, are the places in which<br>he resides. Many are the forms of his Grace. Who is there that can<br>understand in their details the acts, which are all excellent, of Isa, or<br>of all the forms that he has assumed in days of yore? Who can relate how<br>Sarva sports and how he becomes gratified? Maheswara of universal form<br>resides in the hearts of all creatures. While Munis discoursed on the<br>auspicious and excellent acts of Isana, I have heard from them how,<br>impelled by compassion towards his worshippers, he grants them a sight of<br>his person. For the purpose of showing a favour unto the Brahmanas, the<br>denizens of heaven have recited for their information the diverse forms<br>that were assumed by Mahadeva in days of yore. Thou hast asked me about<br>these. I shall recite them to thee, O son.'<br><br>"My mother continued, 'Bhava assumes the forms of Brahma and Vishnu and<br>the chief of the celestials of the Rudras, the Adityas, and the Aswins;<br>and of those deities that are called Viswadevas. He assumes the forms<br>also of men and women, of Pretas and Pisachas, of Kiratas and Savaras,<br>and of all aquatic animals. That illustrious deity assumes the forms of<br>also those Savaras that dwell in the woods and forests. He assumes the<br>forms of tortoises and fishes and conches. He it is that assumes the<br>forms of those coral sprouts that are used as ornaments by men. He<br>assumes also the forms of Yakshas, Rakshasas and Snakes, of Daityas and<br>Danavas. Indeed, the illustrious god assumes the forms of all creatures<br>too that live in holes. He assumes the forms of tigers and lions and<br>deer, of wolves and bears and birds, of owls and of jackals as well. He<br>it is that assumes the forms of swans and crows and peacocks, of<br>chameleons and lizards and storks. He it is that assumes the forms of<br>cranes and vultures and Chakravakas. Verily, he it is that assumes the<br>forms of Chasas and of mountains also. O son, it is Mahadeva that assumes<br>the forms of kine and elephants and horses and camels and asses. He<br>assumes also the forms of goats and leopards and diverse other varieties<br>of animals. It is Bhava who assumes the forms of diverse kinds of birds<br>of beautiful plumage. It is Mahadeva who bears the forms of persons with<br>sticks and those with umbrellas and those with calabashes among<br>Brahmanas.[43] He sometimes becomes six-faced and sometimes becomes<br>multifaced. He sometimes assumes forms having three eyes and forms having<br>many heads. And he sometimes assumes forms having many millions of legs<br>and forms having innumerable stomachs and faces and forms endued with<br>innumerable arms and innumerable sides. He sometimes appears surrounded<br>by innumerable spirits and ghosts. He it is that assumes the forms of<br>Rishis and Gandharvas, and of Siddhas and Charanas. He sometimes assumes<br>a form that is rendered white with the ashes he smears on it and is<br>adorned with a half-moon on the forehead. Adored with diverse hymns<br>uttered with diverse kinds of voice and worshipped with diverse Mantras<br>fraught with encomiums, he, that is sometimes called Sarva, is the<br>Destroyer of all creatures in the universe, and it is upon him, again,<br>that all creatures rest as on their common foundation. Mahadeva is the<br>soul of all creatures. He pervades all things. He is the speaker of all<br>discourses (on duties and rituals). He resides everywhere and should be<br>known as dwelling in the hearts of all creatures in the universe. He<br>knows the desire cherished by every one of his worshippers. He becomes<br>acquainted with the object in which one pays him adorations. Do thou<br>then, if it pleases thee, seek the protection of the chief of the<br>deities. He sometimes rejoices, and sometimes yields to wrath, and<br>sometimes utters the syllable Hum with a very loud noise. He sometimes<br>arms himself with the discus, sometimes with the trident, sometimes with<br>the mace, sometimes with the heavy mullets, sometimes with the scimitar,<br>and sometimes with the battle axe. He it is that assumes the form of<br>Sesha who sustains the world on his head. He has snakes for his belt, and<br>his ears are adorned with ear-rings made of snakes. Snakes form also the<br>sacred thread he wears. An elephant skin forms his upper garment.[44] He<br>sometimes laughs and sometimes sings and sometimes dances most<br>beautifully. Surrounded by innumerable spirits and ghosts, he sometimes<br>plays on musical instruments. Diverse, again are the instruments upon<br>which he plays, and sweet the sounds they yield. He sometimes wanders<br>(over crematoria), sometimes yawns, sometimes cries, and sometimes causes<br>others to cry. He sometimes assumes the guise of one that is mad, and<br>sometimes of one that is intoxicated, and he sometimes utters words that<br>are exceedingly sweet. Endued with appalling fierceness, he sometimes<br>laughs loudly, frightening all creatures with his eyes. He sometimes<br>sleeps and sometimes remains awake and sometimes yawns as he pleases. He<br>sometimes recites sacred Mantras and sometimes becomes the deity of those<br>Mantras which are recited. He sometimes performs penances and sometimes<br>becomes the deity for whose adoration those penances are undergone. He<br>sometimes makes gifts and sometimes receives those gifts; sometimes<br>disposes himself in Yoga and sometimes becomes the object of the Yoga<br>contemplation of others. He may be seen on the sacrificial platform or in<br>the sacrificial stake; in the midst of the cow-pen or in the fire. He may<br>not again be seen there. He may be seen as a boy or as an old man. He<br>sports with the daughters and the spouses of the Rishis. His hair is long<br>and stands erect. He is perfectly naked, for he has the horizon for his<br>garments. He is endued with terrible eyes. He is fair, he is darkish, he<br>is dark, he is pale, he is of the colour of smoke, and he is red. He is<br>possessed of eyes that are large and terrible. He has empty space for his<br>covering and he it is that covers all things. Who is there that can truly<br>understand the limits of Mahadeva who is formless, who is one and<br>indivisible, who conjures of illusions, who is of the cause of all<br>actions and destructive operations in the universe, who assumes the form<br>of Hiranyagarbha, and who is without beginning and without end, and who<br>is without birth.[45] He lives in the heart (of every creature). He is<br>the prana, he is the mind, and he is Jiva (that is invested in the<br>material case). He is the soul of Yoga, and it is that is called Yoga. He<br>is the Yoga-contemplation into which Yogins enter.[46] He is the Supreme<br>Soul. Indeed Maheswara, the purity in essence, is capable of being<br>comprehended not by the senses but through only the Soul seizing his<br>existence. He plays on diverse musical instruments. He is a vocalist. He<br>has a hundred thousand eyes, he has one mouth, he has two mouths, he has<br>three mouths, and he has many mouths. Devoting thyself to him, setting<br>thy heart upon him, depending upon him, and accepting him as thy one<br>refuse, do thou, O son, adore Mahadeva and then mayst thou obtain the<br>fruition of all thy wishes. Hearing those words of my mother, O slayer of<br>foes, from that day my devotion was directed to Mahadeva, having nothing<br>else for its object. I then applied myself to the practice of the<br>austerest penances for gratifying Sankara. For one thousand years I stood<br>on my left toe. After that I passed one thousand years, subsisting only<br>upon fruits. The next one thousand years I passed, subsisting upon the<br>fallen leaves of trees. The next thousand years I passed, subsisting upon<br>water only. After that I passed seven hundred years, subsisting on air<br>alone. In this way, I adored Mahadeva for a full thousand years of the<br>celestials. After this, the puissant Mahadeva, the Master of all the<br>universe, became gratified with me. Desirous of ascertaining whether I<br>was solely devoted to him and him alone, he appeared before me in the<br>form of Sakra surrounded by all the deities. As the celebrated Sakra, he<br>had a thousand eyes on his person and was armed with the thunderbolt. And<br>he rode on an elephant whose complexion was of the purest white, with<br>eyes red, ears folded, the temporal juice trickling down his cheeks, with<br>trunk contracted, terrible to look at, and endued with four tusks.<br>Indeed, riding on such an elephant, the illustrious chief of the deities<br>seemed to blaze forth with his energy. With a beautiful crown on his head<br>and adorned with garlands round his neck and bracelets round his arms, he<br>approached the spot where I was. A white umbrella was held over his head.<br>And he was waited upon by many Apsaras, and many Gandharvas sang his<br>praise. Addressing me, he said,&#8212;O foremost of regenerate persons, I have<br>been gratified with thee. Beg of me whatever boon thou desirest,&#8212;Hearing<br>these words of Sakra I did not become glad. Verily, O Krishna, I answered<br>the chief of the celestials in these words.&#8212;I do not desire any boon at<br>thy hands, or from the hands of any other deity. O amiable deity, I tell<br>thee truly, that it is Mahadeva only from whom I have boons to ask. True,<br>true it is, O Sakra, true are these words that I say unto thee. No other<br>words are at all agreeable to me save those which relate to Maheswara. At<br>the command of Pashupati, that Lord of all creatures, I am ready to<br>become a worm or a tree with many branches. If not obtained through the<br>grace represented by Mahadeva's boons, the very sovereignty of the three<br>worlds would not be acceptable to me. Let me be born among the very<br>Chandalas but let me still be devoted to the feet of Hara. Without,<br>again, being devoted to that Lord of all creatures, I would not like to<br>have birth in the palace of Indra himself. If a person be wanting in<br>devotion to that Lord of the universe,&#8212;that Master of the deities and<br>the Asuras,&#8212;his misery will not end even if from want of food he has to<br>subsist upon only air and water.[47] What is the need of other discourses<br>that are even fraught with other kinds of morality and righteousness,<br>unto those persons who do not like to live even a moment without thinking<br>of feet of Mahadeva? When the unrighteous or sinful Kali Yuga comes, one<br>should never pass a moment without devoting his heart upon Mahadeva. One<br>that has drunk the Amrita constituted by the devotion to Hara, one<br>becomes freed from the fear of the world. One that has not obtained the<br>grace of Mahadeva can never succeed to devote oneself to Mahadeva for a<br>single day or for half a day or for a Muhurta or for a Kshana or for a<br>Lava (very small unit of time). At the command of Mahadeva I shall<br>cheerfully become a worm or an insect, but I have no relish for even the<br>sovereignty of the three worlds, if bestowed by thee, O Sakra. At the<br>word of Hara I would become even a dog. In fact, that would accord with<br>my highest wish. If not given by Maheswara, I would not have the<br>sovereignty of the very deities. I do not wish to have this dominion of<br>the Heavens. I do not wish to have the sovereignty of the celestials. I<br>do not wish to have the region of Brahma. Indeed, I do not wish to have<br>that cessation of individual existence which is called Emancipation and<br>which involves a complete identification with Brahma. But I want to<br>become the slave of Hara. As long as that Lord of all creatures, the<br>illustrious Mahesa, with crown on his head and body possessed of the pure<br>white complexion of the lunar disc, does not become gratified with me, so<br>long shall I cheerfully bear all those afflictions, due to a hundred<br>repetitions of decrepitude, death and birth, that befall to the lot of<br>embodied beings. What person in the universe can obtain tranquillity,<br>without gratifying Rudra that is freed from decripitude and death, that<br>is endued with the effulgence of the Sun, the Moon, or the fire, that is<br>the root or original cause of everything real and unreal in the three<br>worlds, and that exists as one and indivisible entity? If in consequence<br>of my faults, rebirths be mine, I shall, in those new births, devote<br>myself solely to Bhava.'"<br><br>"Indra said, 'What reason canst thou assign for the existence of a<br>Supreme Being or for His being the cause of all causes?'"<br><br>"Upamanyu said, 'I solicit boons from that great Deity named Siva whom<br>utterers of Brahma has described as existent and non-existent, manifest<br>and unmanifest, eternal or immutable, one and many. I solicit boons from<br>Him who is without beginning and middle and end, who is Knowledge and<br>Puissance, who is inconceivable and who is the Supreme Soul. I solicit<br>boons from Him whence comes all Puissance, who has not been produced by<br>any one, who is immutable, and who, though himself unsprung from any<br>seed, is the seed of all things in the universe. I solicit boons from Him<br>who is blazing Effulgence, (beyond Darkness) who is the essence of all<br>penances, who transcends all faculties of which we are possessed and<br>which we may devote for the purpose of comprehending him, and by knowing<br>whom every one becomes freed from grief or sorrow. I worship him, O<br>Purandara, who is conversant with the creation of all elements and the<br>thought of all living creatures, and who is the original cause of the<br>existence or creation of all creatures, who is omnipresent, and who has<br>the puissance to give everything.[48] I solicit boons from Him who cannot<br>be comprehended by argument, who represents the object of the Sankhya and<br>the Yoga systems of philosophy, and who transcends all things, and whom<br>all persons conversant with the topics of enquiry worship and adore.[49]<br>I solicit boons from Him, O Maghavat, who is the soul of Maghavat<br>himself, who is said to be the God of the gods, and who is the Master of<br>all creatures. I solicit boons from Him who it is that first created<br>Brahma, that creator of all the worlds, having filled Space (with His<br>energy) and evoked into existence the primeval egg.[50] Who else than<br>that Supreme Lord could be creator of Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, Space,<br>Mind, and that which is called Mahat? Tell me, O Sakra, who else than<br>Siva could create Mind, Understanding, Consciousness or Ego, the<br>Tanmatras, and the senses? Who is there higher than Siva?[51] The wise<br>say that the Grandsire Brahma is the creator of this universe. Brahma,<br>however, acquired his high puissance and prosperity by adoring and<br>gratifying Mahadeva, that God of gods. That high puissance (consisting of<br>all the three attributes of creation, protection, and destruction), which<br>dwells in that illustrious Being who is endowed with the quality of being<br>one, who created Brahma, Vishnu, and Rudra, was derived from Mahadeva.<br>Tell me who is there that is superior to the Supreme Lord?[52] Who else<br>than that God of gods is competent to unite the sons of Diti with<br>lordship and puissance, judging by the sovereignty and the power of<br>oppressing conferred upon the foremost of the Daityas and Danavas?[53]<br>The different points of the horizon, Time, the Sun, all fiery entities,<br>planets, wind, water, and the stars and constellations,&#8212;these, know<br>thou, are from Mahadeva. Tell us who is higher than the Supreme Lord? Who<br>else is there, except Mahadeva, in the matter of the creation of<br>Sacrifice and the destruction of Tripura? Who else except Mahadeva, the<br>grinder of the foes, has offered lordship to the principal?[54] What<br>need, O Purandara, of many well-sounding statements fraught with spacious<br>sophisms, when I behold thee of a thousand eyes, O best of the<br>deities,&#8212;thee that art worshipped by Siddhas and Gandharvas and the<br>deities and the Rishis? O best of the Kusikas, all this is due to the<br>grace of that God of gods viz., Mahadeva. Know, O Kesava, that this all,<br>consisting of animate and inanimate existences with heaven and other<br>unseen entities, which occur in this world, and which has the<br>all-pervading Lord for their soul, has flowed from Maheswara and has been<br>created (by him) for enjoyment by Jiva.[55] In the worlds that are known<br>by the names of Bhu, Bhuva, Swah, and Maha, in the midst of the mountains<br>of Lokaloka, in the islands, in the mountains of Meru, in all things that<br>yield happiness, and in the hearts of all creatures, O illustrious<br>Maghavat, resides Mahadeva, as persons conversant with all the topics of<br>enquiry say. If, O Sakra, the Devas (deities) and the Asuras could see<br>any other puissant form than Bhava's, would not both of them, especially<br>the former, when opposed and afflicted by the latter, have sought the<br>protection of that form? In all hostile encounters of the deities, the<br>Yakshas, the Uragas and the Rakshasas, that terminating in mutual<br>destruction, it is Bhava that gives unto those that meet with<br>destruction, puissance commensurate with their respective locations as<br>dependent upon their acts. Tell me, who else than Maheswara is there for<br>bestowing boons upon, and once more chastising the Andhaka and Sukra and<br>Dundubhi and Maharshi and many foremost of Yakshas, Indra and Vala and<br>Rakshasas and the Nivatakavachas? Was not the vital seed of Mahadeva,<br>that Master of both the deities and the Asuras, poured as a libation upon<br>the fire? From that seed sprung a mountain of gold. Who else is there<br>whose seed can be said to be possessed of such virtue.[56] Who else in<br>this world is praised as having the horizon only for his garments? Who<br>else can be said to be a Brahmacharin with his vital seed drawn up? Who<br>else is there that has half his body occupied by his dear spouse?[57] Who<br>else is there that has been able to subjugate Kama, the god of desire?<br>Tell me, O Indra, what other Being possesses that high region of supreme<br>felicity that is applauded by all the deities? Who else has the<br>crematorium as his sporting ground? Who else is there that is so praised<br>for his dancing? Whose puissance and worship remain immutable? Who else<br>is there that sports with spirits and ghosts? Tell me, O deity, who else<br>has associate that are possessed of strength like his own and that are,<br>therefore, proud of that strength or puissance?[58] Who else is there<br>whose status is applauded as unchangeable and worshipped with reverence<br>by the three worlds? Who else is there that pours rain, gives heat, and<br>blazes forth in Energy? From whom else do we derive our wealth of herbs?<br>Who else upholds all kinds of wealth? Who else sports as much as he<br>pleases in the three worlds of mobile and immobile things? O Indra, know<br>Maheswara to be the original cause (of everything). He is adored by<br>Yogins, by Rishis, by the Gandharvas, and by the Siddhas, with the aid of<br>knowledge, (of ascetic) success, and of the rites laid down in the<br>scriptural ordinances.[59] He is adored by both the deities and the<br>Asuras with the aid of sacrifices by acts and the affliction of the<br>ritual laid down in the scriptures. The fruits of action can never touch<br>him for he transcends them all. Being such, I call him the original cause<br>of everything.[60] He is both gross and subtile. He is without compare.<br>He cannot be conceived by the senses. He is endued with attributes and he<br>is divested of them. He is the lord of attributes, for they are under his<br>control. Even such is the place that is Maheswara's. He is the cause of<br>the maintenance and the creation (of the universe). He is the cause of<br>the universe and the cause also of its destruction. He is the Past, the<br>Present, and the Future. He is the parent of all things. Verily, He is<br>the cause of every thing. He is that which is mutable, He is the<br>unmanifest, He is Knowledge; He is ignorance; He is every act, He is<br>every omission; He is righteousness; and He is unrighteousness. Him, O<br>Sakra, do I call the cause of every thing. Behold, O Indra, in the image<br>of Mahadeva the indications of both the sexes. That god of gods, viz.,<br>Rudra, that cause of both creation and destruction, displays in his form<br>the indications of both the sexes as the one cause of the creation of the<br>universe. My mother formerly told me that he is the cause of the universe<br>and the one cause of everything. There is no one that is higher than Isa,<br>O Sakra. If it pleases thee, do thou throw thyself on his kindness and<br>protection. Thou hast visible evidence, O chief of the celestials, of the<br>fact that the universe has sprung from the union of the sexes (as<br>represented by Mahadeva). The universe, thou knowest, is the sum of what<br>is vested with attributes and what else is divested of attributes and has<br>for its immediate cause the seeds of Brahma and others. Brahma and Indra<br>and Hutasana and Vishnu and all the other deities, along with the Daityas<br>and the Asuras, crowned with the fruition of a thousand desires, always<br>say that there is none that is higher than Mahadeva.[61] Impelled by<br>desire, I solicit, with restrained mind, that god known to all the mobile<br>and immobile universe,&#8212;him, that is, who has been spoken of as the best<br>and highest of all the gods, and who is auspiciousness itself, for<br>obtaining without delay that highest of all acquisitions, viz.,<br>Emancipation. What necessity is there of other reasons (for establishing)<br>what I believe? The supreme Mahadeva is the cause of all causes. We have<br>never heard that the deities have, at any time, adored the sign of any<br>other god than Mahadeva. If Maheswara be not accepted, tell me, if thou<br>hast ever heard of it, who else is there whose sign has been worshipped<br>or is being worshipped by all the deities? He whose sign is always<br>worshipped by Brahma, by Vishnu, by thee, O Indra, with all the other<br>deities, is verily the foremost of all adorable deities. Brahma has for<br>his sign the lotus, Vishnu has for his the discus, Indra has for his sign<br>the thunder-bolt. But the creatures of the world do not bear any of the<br>signs that distinguish these deities. On the other hand, all creatures<br>bear the signs that mark Mahadeva and his spouse. Hence, all creatures<br>must be regarded as belonging to Maheswara. All creatures of the feminine<br>sex, have sprung from Ulna's nature as their cause, and hence it is they<br>bear the mark of femininity that distinguishes Uma; while all creatures<br>that are masculine, having sprung from Siva, bear the masculine mark that<br>distinguishes Siva. That person who says that there is, in the three<br>worlds with their mobile and immobile creatures, any other cause than the<br>Supreme Lord, and that which is not marked with the mark of either<br>Mahadeva or his spouse should be regarded as very wretched and should not<br>be counted among the creatures of the universe. Every being with the mark<br>of the masculine sex should be known to be of Isana, while every being<br>with the mark of the feminine sex should be known to be of Uma. This<br>universe of mobile and immobile creatures is provided by two kinds of<br>forms (viz., male and female). It is from Mahadeva that I wish to obtain<br>boons. Failing in this, O Kausika, I would rather prefer dissolution<br>itself. Go or remain, O Sakra, as thou, O slayer of Vala, desirest. I<br>wish to have boons or curses from Mahadeva. No other deity shall I ever<br>acknowledge, nor would I have from any other deity the fruition of all my<br>wishes.&#8212;Having said these words unto the chief of the celestials, I<br>became overwhelmed with grief at the thought of Mahadeva not having been<br>gratified with me not withstanding my severe austerities. Within the<br>twinkling of an eye, however, I saw the celestial elephant I had beheld<br>before me transformed into a bull as white as a swan, or the Jasminum<br>pubescens, or a stalk of the lotus or silver, or the ocean of milk. Of<br>huge body, the hair of its tail was black and the hue of its eyes was<br>tawny like that of honey. Its horns were hard as adamant and had the<br>colour of gold. With their very sharp ends, whose hue was a mild red, the<br>bull seemed to tear the Earth. The animal was adorned all over with<br>ornaments made of the purest gold. Its face and hoofs and nose and ears<br>were exceedingly beautiful and its waist too exceedingly well-formed. Its<br>flanks were possessed of great beauty and its neck was very thick. Its<br>whole form was exceedingly agreeable and beautiful to look at. Its hump<br>shone with great beauty and seemed to occupy the whole of its<br>shoulder-joint. And it looked like the summit of a mountain of snow or<br>like a cliff of white clouds in the sky. Upon the back of that animal I<br>beheld seated the illustrious Mahadeva with his spouse Uma. Verily,<br>Mahadeva shone like the lord of stars while he is at his full. The fire<br>born of his energy resembled in effulgence the lightening that flashes<br>amid clouds. Verily, it seemed as if a thousand suns rose there, filling<br>every side with a dazzling splendour. The energy of the Supreme Lord<br>looked like the Samvartaka fire which destroys all creatures at the end<br>of the Yuga. Overspread with that energy, the horizon became such that I<br>could see nothing on any side. Filled with anxiety I once more thought<br>what it could mean. That energy, however, did not pervade every side for<br>any length of time, for soon, through the illusion of that god of gods,<br>the horizon became clear. I then behold the illustrious Sthanu or<br>Maheswara seated on the back of his bull, of blessed and agreeable<br>appearance and looking like a smokeless fire. And the great god was<br>accompanied by Parvati of faultless features. Indeed, I beheld the<br>blue-throated and high-souled Sthanu, unattached to everything, that<br>receptacle of all kinds of force, endued with eight and ten arms and<br>adorned with all kinds of ornaments. Clad in white vestments, he wore<br>white garlands, and had white unguents smeared upon his limbs. The colour<br>of his banner, irresistible in the universe, was white. The sacred thread<br>round his person was also white. He was surrounded with associates, all<br>possessed with prowess equal to his own, who were singing or dancing or<br>playing on diverse kinds of musical instruments. A crescent moon, of pale<br>hue, formed his crown, and placed on his forehead it looked like the moon<br>that rises in the autumnal firmament. He seemed to dazzle with splendour,<br>in consequence of his three eyes that looked like three suns. The garland<br>of the purest white, that was on his body, shone like a wreath of<br>lotuses, of the purest white, adorned with jewels and gems. I also<br>beheld, O Govinda, the weapons in their embodied forms and fraught with<br>every kind of energy, that belong to Bhava of immeasurable prowess. The<br>high-souled deity held a bow whose hues resembled those of the rainbow.<br>That bow is celebrated under the name of the Pinaka and is in reality a<br>mighty snake. Indeed, that snake of seven heads and vast body, of sharp<br>fangs and virulent poison, of large neck and the masculine sex, was<br>twined round with the cord that served as its bowstring. And there was a<br>shaft whose splendour looked like that of the sun or of the fire that<br>appears at the end of the Yuga. Verily, that shaft was the excellent<br>Pasupata that mighty and terrible weapon, which is without a second,<br>indescribable for its power, and capable of striking every creature with<br>fear. Of vast proportions, it seemed to constantly vomit sparks of fire.<br>Possessed of one foot, of large teeth, and a thousand heads and thousand<br>Stomachs, it has a thousand arms, a thousand tongues, and a thousand<br>eyes. Indeed, it seemed to continually vomit fire. O thou of mighty arms,<br>that weapon is superior to the Brahma, the Narayana, the Aindra, the<br>Agneya, and the Varuna weapons. Verily, it is capable of neutralising<br>every other weapon in the universe. It was with that weapon that the<br>illustrious Mahadeva had in days of yore, burnt and consumed in a moment<br>the triple city of the Asuras. With the greatest ease, O Govinda,<br>Mahadeva, using that single arrow, achieved that feat. That weapon, shot<br>by Mahadeva's arms, can, without doubt consume in half the time taken up<br>by a twinkling of the eyes the entire universe with all its mobile and<br>immobile creatures. In the universe there is no being including even<br>Brahma and Vishnu and the deities, that are incapable of being slain by<br>that weapon. O sire, I saw that excellent, wonderful and incomparable<br>weapon in the hand of Mahadeva. There is another mysterious and very<br>powerful weapon which is equal or perhaps, superior to the Pasupata<br>weapon. I beheld that also. It is celebrated in all the worlds as the Sum<br>of the Sula-armed Mahadeva. Hurled by the illustrious deity, that weapon<br>is competent to rive the entire Earth or dry up the waters of the ocean<br>or annihilate the entire universe. In days of yore, Yuvanaswa's son, king<br>Mandhatri, that conqueror of the three worlds, possessed of imperial sway<br>and endued with abundant energy, was, with all his troops, destroyed by<br>means of that weapon. Endued with great might and great energy and<br>resembling Sakra himself in prowess, the king, O Govinda, was slain by<br>the Rakshasa Lavana with the aid of this Sula which he had got from Siva.<br>The Sula has a very keen point. Exceedingly terrible, it is capable of<br>causing everybody's hair stand on its end. I saw it in the hand of<br>Mahadeva, as if roaring with rage, having contracted its forehead into<br>three wrinkles. It resembled, O Krishna, a smokeless fire or the sun that<br>rises at the end of the Yuga. The handle of that Sula, was made of a<br>mighty snake. It is really indescribable. It looked like the universal<br>Destroyer himself armed with his noose. I saw this weapon, O Govinda, in<br>the hand of Mahadeva. I beheld also another weapon, viz., that<br>sharp-edged battle-axe which, in days of yore, was given unto Rama by the<br>gratified Mahadeva for enabling him to exterminate the Kshatriyas. It was<br>with this weapon that Rama (of Bhrigu's race) slew in dreadful battle the<br>great Karttaviryya who was the ruler of all the world. It was with that<br>weapon that Jamadagni's son, O Govinda, was able to exterminate the<br>Kshatriyas for one and twenty times. Of blazing edge and exceedingly<br>terrible, that axe was hanging on the shoulder, adorned with a snake, of<br>Mahadeva. Indeed, it shone on Mahadeva's person like the flame of a<br>blazing fire. I beheld innumerable other celestial weapons with Mahadeva<br>of great intelligence. I have, however named only a few, O sinless one,<br>in consequence of their principal character. On the left side of the<br>great god stood the Grandsire Brahma seated on an excellent car unto<br>which were attached swans endued with the speed of the mind. On the same<br>side could be seen Narayana also, seated on the son of Vinata, and<br>bearing the conch, the discus, and the mace. Close to the goddess Uma was<br>Skanda seated on his peacock, bearing his fatal dart and bells, and<br>looking like another Agni. In the front of Mahadeva I beheld Nandi<br>standing armed with his Sula and looking like a second Sankara (for<br>prowess and energy). The Munis headed by the Self-born Manu and Rishis<br>having Bhrigu for their first, and the deities with Sakra at their head,<br>all came there. All the tribes of spirits and ghosts, and the celestial<br>Mothers, stood surrounding Mahadeva and saluting him with reverence. The<br>deities were engaged in singing the praises of Mahadeva by uttering<br>diverse hymns. The Grandsire Brahma uttering a Rathantara, praised<br>Mahadeva. Narayana also, uttering the Jyestha Saman, sang the praises of<br>Bhava. Sakra also did the same with the aid of those foremost of Vedic<br>Mantras, viz., the Sata-Rudriam. Verily, Brahma and Narayana and<br>Sakra,&#8212;those three high-souled deities,&#8212;shone there like three<br>sacrificial fires. In their midst shone the illustrious God like the sun<br>in the midst of his corona, emerged from autumnal clouds. I beheld<br>myriads of suns and moons, also in the sky, O Kesava. I then praised the<br>illustrious Lord of everything, the supreme Master of the universe.<br><br>"Upamanyu continued, 'I said, Salutations to thee, O illustrious one, O<br>thou that constitutest the refuge of all things, O thou that art called<br>Mahadeva!

Salutations to thee that art Isana, to thee<br>that art the destroyer of Bhaga, to thee that art the slayer of Andhaka,<br>to thee that art the universe, to thee that art possessed of illusion, to<br>thee that art both conceivable and inconceivable.[64] Thou art the one<br>end of all creatures, thou art the foremost, thou art the heart of<br>everything. Thou art the Brahma of all the deities, thou art the<br>Nilardhita Red and Blue of the Rudras. Thou art the Soul of the<br>creatures, thou art He who is called Purusha in the Sankhya philosophy,<br>thou art the Rishabha among all things sacred, thou art that which is<br>called auspicious by Yogins and which, according to them, is without<br>parts (being indivisible). Amongst those that are observant of the<br>different modes of life, thou art the House-holder, thou art the great<br>Lord amongst the lords of the universe. Thou art Kuvera among all the<br>Yakshas, and thou art Vishnu amongst all the sacrifices.[65] Thou art<br>Meru amongst mountains, thou art the Moon among all luminaries of the<br>firmament, thou art Vasishtha amongst Rishis, thou art Surya among the<br>planets. Thou art the lion among all wild animals, and among all domestic<br>animals, thou art the bull that is worshipped by all people. Among the<br>Adityas thou art Vishnu (Upendra), among the Vasu thou art Pavaka, among<br>birds thou art the son of Vinata (Garuda), and among snakes thou art<br>Ananta (Sesha). Among the Vedas thou art the Samans, among the Yajushes<br>thou art the Sata-Rudriyam, among Yogins thou art Sanatkumara, and among<br>Sankhyas thou art Kapila. Among the Maruts thou art Sakra, among the<br>Pitris thou art Devarat, among all the regions (for the residence of<br>created beings) thou art the region of Brahman, and amongst all the ends<br>that creatures attain to, thou art Moksha or Emancipation. Thou art the<br>Ocean of milk among all oceans, among all rocky eminences thou art<br>Himavat, among all the orders thou art the Brahmana, and among all<br>learned Brahmanas thou art he that has undergone and is observant of the<br>Diksha. Thou art the Sun among all things in the world, thou art the<br>destroyer called Kala. Thou art whatever else possessed of superior<br>energy of eminence that exists in the universe. Thou art possessed of<br>supreme puissance. Even this is what represents my certain conclusion.<br>Salutations to thee, O puissant and illustrious one, O thou that art kind<br>to all thy worshippers. Salutations to thee, O lord of Yogins. I bow to<br>thee, O original cause of the universe. Be thou gratified with me that am<br>thy worshipper, that am very miserable and helpless, O Eternal Lord, do<br>thou become the refuge of this adorer of thine that is very weak and<br>miserable. O Supreme Lord, it behoveth thee to pardon all those<br>transgressions of which I have been guilty, taking compassion upon me on<br>the ground of my being thy devoted worshipper. I was stupefied by thee, O<br>Lord of all the deities, in consequence of the disguise in which thou<br>showest thyself to me. O Maheswara, I did not give thee the Arghya or<br>water to wash thy feet.[66] Having hymned the praises of Isana in this<br>way, I offered him, with great devotion, water to wash his feet and the<br>ingredients of the Arghya, and then, with joined hands, I resigned myself<br>to him, being prepared to do whatever he would bid. Then, O sire, an<br>auspicious shower of flowers fell upon my head, possessed of celestial<br>fragrance and bedewed with cold water. The celestial musicians began to<br>play on their kettle-drums. A delicious breeze, fragrant and agreeable,<br>began to blow and fill me with pleasure. Then Mahadeva accompanied by his<br>spouse, and having the bull for his sign, having been gratified with me,<br>addressed the celestials assembled there in these words, filling me with<br>great joy,&#8212;Behold, ye deities, the devotion of the high-souled Upamanyu.<br>Verily, steady and great is that devotion, and entirely immutable, for it<br>exists unalterably.&#8212;Thus addressed by the great God armed with the Sula,<br>the deities, O Krishna, having bowed down unto him and joined their hands<br>in reverence, said these words,&#8212;O illustrious one, O God of the gods, O<br>master of the universe, O Lord of all, let this best of regenerate<br>persons obtain from thee the fruition of all his desires.&#8212;Thus addressed<br>by all the deities, with the Grandsire Brahma among them. Sarva,<br>otherwise called Isa and Sankara, said these words as if smiling unto<br>me.'"<br><br>"The illustrious Sankara said, 'O dear Upamanyu, I am gratified with<br>thee. Behold me, O foremost of Munis, O learned Rishi, thou art firmly<br>devoted to me and well hast thou been tested by me. I have been very<br>highly pleased with thee in consequence of this thy devotion to Siva. I<br>shall, therefore, give thee today the fruition of whatever desires thou<br>mayst have in thy heart. Thus addressed by Mahadeva of great wisdom,<br>tears of joy came into my eyes and my hair stood on its end (through<br>emotion). Kneeling down unto him and bowing unto him repeatedly, I then,<br>with a voice that was choked with delight, said unto him,&#8212;O illustrious<br>god, it seems to me that I was hitherto dead and that it is only today<br>that I have taken my birth, and that my birth bath today borne fruit,<br>since I am staying now in the presence of Him who is the Master of both<br>the deities and the Asuras! Who else is more praiseworthy than I, since I<br>am beholding with these eyes of mine, Him of immeasurable prowess whom<br>the very deities are unable to behold without first paying hearty<br>worship? That which they that are possessed of learning and wisdom say is<br>the highest of all topics, which is Eternal, which is distinguished from<br>all else, which is unborn, which is Knowledge, which is indestructible,<br>is identical with thee, O puissant and illustrious one, thee that art the<br>beginning of all the topics, thee that art indestructible and changeless,<br>thee that art conversant with the ordinances which govern all the topics,<br>thee that art the foremost of Purushas, thee that art the highest of the<br>high. Thou art he that hadst created from thy right side the Grandsire<br>Brahma, the Creator of all things. Thou art he that hadst created from<br>thy left side Vishnu for protecting the Creation. Thou art that puissant<br>Lord who didst create Rudra when the end of the Yuga came and when the<br>Creation was once more to be dissolved. That Rudra, who sprang from thee<br>destroyed the Creation with all its mobile and immobile beings, assuming<br>the form of Kala of great energy, of the cloud Samvartaka (charged with<br>water which myriads of oceans are not capacious enough to bear), and of<br>the all consuming fire. Verily, when the period comes for the dissolution<br>of the universe, that Rudra stands, ready to swallow up the universe.<br>Thou art that Mahadeva, who is the original Creator of the universe with<br>all its mobile and immobile entities. Thou art he, who, at the end of the<br>Kalpa, stands, withdrawing all things into thyself. Thou art he that<br>pervadest all things, that art the Soul of all things, thou art the<br>Creator of the Creator of all entities. Incapable of being seen by even<br>any of the deities, thou art he that exists, pervading all entities. If,<br>O lord, thou hast been gratified with me and if thou wouldst grant me<br>boons, let this be the boon, O Lord of all the deities, that my devotion<br>to thee may remain unchanged. O best of the deities, let me, through thy<br>grace, have knowledge of the Present, the Past, and the Future. I shall<br>also, with all my kinsmen and friends, always eat food mixed with milk.<br>And let thy illustrious self be for ever present at our retreat.&#8212;Thus<br>addressed by me, the illustrious Maheswara endued with supreme energy,<br>that Master of all mobile and immobile, viz., Siva, worshipped of all the<br>universe, then said unto me these words.'<br><br>"The illustrious Deity said, 'Be thou free from every misery and pain,<br>and be thou above decrepitude and death. Be thou possessed of fame, be<br>thou endued with great energy, and let spiritual knowledge be thine. Thou<br>shalt, through my grace, be always sought for by the Rishis. Be thy<br>behaviour good and righteous, be every desirable attribute thine, be thou<br>possessed of universal knowledge, and be thou of agreeable appearance.<br>Let undecaying youth be thine, and let thy energy be like that of fire.<br>Wherever, again, thou mayst desire the presence of the ocean of milk that<br>is so agreeable to thee, there shall that ocean appear before thee (ready<br>for being utilised by thee and thy friends for purposes of thy food). Do<br>thou, with thy friends, always obtain food prepared with milk, with the<br>celestial nectar besides being mixed with it.[67] After the expiration of<br>a Kalpa thou shalt then obtain my companionship. Thy family and race and<br>kinsmen shall be exhaustless. O foremost of regenerate ones, thy devotion<br>to me shalt be eternal. And. O best of Brahmanas, I shall always accord<br>my presence to thy asylum. Live, O son, whithersoever thou likest, and<br>let no anxiety be thine. Thought of by thee, I shall, O learned Brahmana,<br>grant thee a sight of myself again.&#8212;Having said these words, and granted<br>me these boons, the illustrious Isana, endued with the effulgence of<br>millions of Suns, disappeared there and then. It was even thus, O<br>Krishna, that I beheld, with the aid of austere penances, that God of<br>gods. I also obtained all that was said by the great Deity endued with<br>supreme intelligence. Behold, O Krishna, before thy eyes, these Siddhas<br>residing here and these Rishis and Vidyadharas and Yakshas and Gandharvas<br>and Apsaras. Behold these trees and creepers and plants yielding all<br>sorts of flowers and fruits. Behold them bearing the flowers of every<br>season, with beautiful leaves, and shedding a sweet fragrance all around.<br>O thou of mighty arms, all these are endued with a celestial nature<br>through the grace of that god of gods, that Supreme Lord, that<br>high-souled Deity.'<br><br>"Vasudeva continued, 'Hearing these words of his and beholding, as it<br>were, with my own eyes all that he had related to me, I became filled<br>with wonder. I then addressed the great ascetic Upamanyu and said unto<br>him,&#8212;Deserving of great praise art thou, O foremost of learned<br>Brahmanas, for what righteous man is there other than thou whose retreat<br>enjoys the distinction of being honoured with the presence of that God of<br>gods? Will the puissant Siva, will the great Sankara, O chief of<br>ascetics, grant me also a sight of his person and show me favour.'<br><br>"Upamanyu said, 'Without doubt, O thou of eyes like lotus-petals, thou<br>wilt obtain a sight of Mahadeva very soon, even as, O sinless one, I<br>succeeded in obtaining a sight of him. O thou of immeasurable prowess, I<br>see with my spiritual eyes that thou wilt, in the sixth month from this,<br>succeed in obtaining a sight of Mahadeva, O best of all persons. Thou, O<br>foremost of the Yadus, wilt obtain from Maheswara and his spouse, four<br>and twenty boons. I tell thee what is true. Through the grace of that<br>Deity endued with supreme wisdom, the Past, the Future and the Present<br>are known to me. The great Hara has favoured these Rishis numbering by<br>thousands and others as numerous. Why will not the puissant Deity show<br>favour to thee, O Mahadeva? The meeting of the gods is always commendable<br>with one like thee, with one that is devoted to the Brahmanas, with one<br>that is full of compassion and that is full of faith. I shall give thee<br>certain Mantras. Recite them continuously. By this thou art certain to<br>behold Sankara.'<br><br>"The blessed Vishnu continued, 'I then said unto him, O regenerate one,<br>through thy grace, O great ascetic. I shall behold the lord of the<br>deities, that grinder of multitudes of Diti's sons. Eight days, O<br>Bharata, passed there like an hour, all of us being thus occupied with<br>talk on Mahadeva. On the eighth day, I underwent the Diksha (initiation)<br>according to due rites, at the hands of that Brahmana and received the<br>staff from his hands. I underwent the prescribed shave. I took up a<br>quantity of Kusa blades in my hand. I wore rags for my vestments. I<br>rubbed my person with ghee. I encircled a cord of Munja grass round my<br>loins. For one month I lived on fruits. The second month I subsisted upon<br>water. The third, the fourth and the fifth months I passed, living upon<br>air alone. I stood all the while, supporting myself upon one foot and<br>with my arms also raised upwards, and foregoing sleep all the while. I<br>then beheld, O Bharata, in the firmament an effulgence that seemed to be<br>as dazzling as that of a thousand Suns combined together. Towards the<br>centre of that effulgence, O son of Pandu, I saw a cloud looking like a<br>mass of blue hills, adorned with rows of cranes, embellished with many a<br>grand rainbow, with flashes of lightning and the thunder-fire looking<br>like eyes set on it.[68] Within that cloud was the puissant Mahadeva.<br>himself of dazzling splendour, accompanied by his spouse Uma. Verily, the<br>great Deity seemed to shine with his penances, energy, beauty,<br>effulgence, and his dear spouse by his side. The puissant Maheswara, with<br>his spouse by his side, shone in the midst of that cloud. The appearance<br>seemed to be like that of the Sun in the midst of racking clouds with the<br>Moon by his side. The hair on my body, O son of Kunti, stood on its end,<br>and my eyes expanded with wonder upon beholding Hara, the refuge of all<br>the deities and the dispeller of all their griefs. Mahadeva was adorned<br>with a diadem on his head. He was armed with his Sula. He was clad in a<br>tiger-skin, had matted locks on his head, and bore the staff (of the<br>Sanyasin) in one of his hands. He was armed, besides with his Pinaka and<br>the thunderbolt. His teeth was sharp-pointed. He was decked with an<br>excellent bracelet for the upper arm. His sacred thread was constituted<br>by a snake. He wore an excellent garland of diversified colours on his<br>bosom, that hung down to his toes. Verily, I beheld him like the<br>exceedingly bright moon of an autumnal evening. Surrounded by diverse<br>clans of spirits and ghosts, he looked like the autumnal Sun difficult of<br>being gazed at for its dazzling brightness. Eleven hundred Rudras stood<br>around that Deity of restrained soul and white deeds, then seated upon<br>his bull. All of them were employed in hymning his praises. The Adityas,<br>the Vasus, the Sadhyas, the Viswedevas, and the twin Aswins praised that<br>Lord of the universe by uttering the hymns occurring in the scriptures.<br>The puissant Indra and his brother Upendra, the two sons of Aditi, and<br>the Grandsire Brahma, all uttered, in the presence of Bhava, the<br>Rathantara Saman. Innumerable masters of Yoga, all the regenerate Rishis<br>with their children, all the celestial Rishis, the goddess Earth, the Sky<br>(between Earth and Heaven), the Constellations, the Planets, the Months,<br>the Fortnights, the Seasons, Night, the Years, the Kshanas, the Muhurtas,<br>the Nimeshas, the Yugas one after another, all the celestial Sciences and<br>branches of knowledge, and all beings conversant with Truth, were seen<br>bowing down unto that Supreme Preceptor, that great Father, that giver<br>(or origin) of Yoga. Sanatkumara, the Vedas, the Histories, Marichi,<br>Angiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, the seven Manus, Soma, the<br>Atharvans, and Vrihaspati, Bhrigu, Daksha, Kasyapa, Vasishtha, Kasya, the<br>Schandas, Diksha, the Sacrifices, Dakshina, the Sacrificial Fires, the<br>Havis (clarified butter) poured in sacrifices, and all the requisites of<br>the sacrifices, were beheld by me, O Yudhishthira, standing there in<br>their embodied forms. All the guardians of the worlds, all the Rivers,<br>all the snakes, the mountains, the celestial Mothers, all the spouses and<br>daughters of the celestials, thousands upon thousands and millions of<br>ascetics, were seen to bow down to that puissant Lord who is the soul of<br>tranquillity. The Mountains, the Oceans, and the Points of the compass<br>also did the same, the Gandharvas and the Apsaras highly skilled in<br>music, in celestial strains, sang and hymned the praises of Bhava who is<br>full of wonder. The Vidyadharas, the Danavas, the Guhyakas, the<br>Rakshasas, and all created beings, mobile and immobile, adorned, in<br>thought, word and deed, that puissant Lord. Before me, that Lord of all<br>the gods viz., Sarva, appeared seated in all his glory. Seeing that Isana<br>had showed himself to me by being seated in glory before my eyes, the<br>whole universe, with the Grandsire and Sakra, looked at me. I, however,<br>had not the power to look at Mahadeva. The great Deity then addressed me<br>saying, 'Behold, O Krishna, and speak to me. Thou hast adorned me<br>hundreds and thousands of times. There is no one in the three worlds that<br>is dearer to me than thou.' After I had bowed unto him, his spouse, viz.,<br>the goddess Uma, became gratified with me. I then addressed in these<br>words the great God whose praises are hymned by all the deities with the<br>Grandsire Brahma at their head.'<br><br>"The blessed Vishnu said, 'I saluted Mahadeva, saying,&#8212;Salutations to<br>thee, O thou that art the eternal origin of all things. The Rishis say<br>that thou art the Lord of the Vedas. The righteous say that thou art<br>Penance, thou art Sattwa, thou art Rajas, thou art Tamas, and thou art<br>Truth. Thou art Brahman, thou art Rudra, thou art Varuna, thou art Agni,<br>thou art Manu, thou art Bhava, thou art Dhatri, thou art Tashtri, thou<br>art Vidhatri, thou art the puissant Master of all things, and thou art<br>everywhere. All beings, mobile and immobile, have sprung from thee. This<br>triple world with all its mobile and immobile entities, has been created<br>by thee. The Rishis say that thou art superior to the senses, the mind,<br>the vital breaths, the seven sacrificial fires, all others that have<br>their refuge in the all-pervading Soul, and all the deities that are<br>adored and worthy of adoration. Thou, O illustrious one, art the Vedas,<br>the Sacrifices, Soma, Dakshina, Pavaka, Havi, and all other requisites of<br>sacrifice. The merit obtained by sacrifices, gifts made to others, the<br>study of the Vedas, vows, regulations in respect of restraint, Modesty,<br>Fame, Prosperity, Splendour, Contentment, and Success, all exist for<br>leading to thee.[69] Desire, Wrath, Fear, Cupidity, Pride, Stupefaction,<br>and Malice, Pains and Diseases, are, O illustrious one, thy children.<br>Thou art all acts that creatures do, thou art the joy and sorrow that<br>flow from those acts, thou art the absence of joy and sorrow, thou art<br>that Ignorance which is the indestructible seed of Desire, thou art the<br>high origin of Mind, thou art Puissance, and thou art Eternity.[70] Thou<br>art the Unmanifest, thou art Pavana, thou art inconceivable, thou art the<br>thousand-rayed Sun, thou art the effulgent Chit, thou art the first of<br>all the topics, and thou art the refuge of life.[71] The use of words<br>like Mahat, Soul, Understanding, Brahman, Universe, Sambhu, and Self-born<br>and other words occurring in succession (in the Vedas), show that thy<br>nature has been judged (by persons conversant with the Vedas) as<br>identical with Mahat and Soul. Verily, regarding thee as all this, the<br>learned Brahmanas win over that ignorance which lies at the root of the<br>world. Thou residest in the heart of all creatures, and thou art adored<br>by the Rishis as Kshetrajna. Thy arms and feet extend to every place, and<br>thy eyes, head, and face are everywhere. Thou hearest everywhere in the<br>universe, and thou stayest, pervading all things. Of all acts that are<br>performed in the Nimeshas and other divisions of time that spring in<br>consequence of the puissance of the Sun, thou art the fruit.[72] Thou art<br>the original effulgence (of the supreme Chit). Thou art Purusha, and thou<br>residest in the hearts of all things. Thou art the various Yogic<br>attributes of success, viz., Subtility and Grossness and Fruition and<br>Supremacy and Effulgence and Immutability.[73] Understanding and<br>intelligence and all the worlds rest upon thee. They that are devoted to<br>meditation, that are always engaged in Yoga, that are devoted to or firm<br>in Truth and that have subjugated their passions, seek thee and rest on<br>thee.[74] They that know thee for one that is Immutable, or one that<br>resides in all hearts, or one that is endued with supreme puissance, or<br>one that is the ancient Purusha, or one that is pure Knowledge, or one<br>that is the effulgent Chit, or one that is the highest refuge of all<br>persons endued with intelligence, are certainly persons of great<br>intelligence. Verily, such persons stay, transcending intelligence.[75]<br>By understanding the seven subtile entities (viz., Mahat, Ego, and five<br>subtile primal elements called Tanmatras), by comprehending thy six<br>attributes (of Omniscience, Contentment of Fullness, Knowledge without<br>beginning, Independence, Puissance that is not at fault at any time and<br>that is infinite), and being conversant with Yoga that is freed from<br>every false notion, the man of knowledge succeeds in entering into thy<br>great self.&#8212;After I had said these words, O Partha, unto Bhava, that<br>dispeller of grief and pain, the universe, both mobile and immobile, sent<br>up a leonine shout (expressive of their approval of the correctness of my<br>words). The innumerable Brahmanas there present, the deities and the<br>Asuras, the Nagas, the Pisachas, the Pitris, the birds, diverse<br>Rakshasas, diverse classes of ghosts and spirits, and all the great<br>Rishis, then bowed down unto that great Deity. There then fell upon my<br>head showers of celestial flowers possessed of great fragrance, and<br>delicious winds blew on the spot. The puissant Sankara then, devoted to<br>the good of the universe, looked at the goddess Uma and the lord of the<br>celestials and myself also, and thus spoke unto me,&#8212;We know, O Krishna,<br>that thou, O slayer of foes, art filled with the greatest devotion<br>towards us. Do what is for thy good. My love and affection for thee is<br>very great. Do thou ask for eight boons. I shall verily give them unto<br>thee, O Krishna, O best of all persons, tell me what they are, O chief of<br>the Yadavas. Name what thou wishest. However difficult of attainment they<br>be, thou shalt have them still.'"[76]
