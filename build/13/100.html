                            "Yudhishthira said, 'How was Nahusha plunged into distress? How was he<br>hurled down on the earth? How, indeed, was he deprived of the sovereignty<br>of the gods? It behoveth thee to recite everything to me.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Even thus did those two Rishis, viz., Bhrigu and Agastya,<br>converse with each other. I have already told thee how Nahusha, when he<br>first became the chief of the gods, acted in a becoming way. Verily, all<br>acts of human and celestial nature flowed from that high souled royal<br>sage! The offering of light, and all other rites of a similar kind, the<br>due presentation of Valis, and all rites as are performed on especially<br>sacred days,&#8212;all these were properly observed by the high-souled Nahusha<br>who had become the sovereign of the deities.[446] Pious acts are always<br>observed by those that are possessed of wisdom, in both the world of men<br>and that of the deities. Verily, O foremost of kings, if such acts are<br>observed, householders always succeed in acquiring prosperity and<br>advancement. Even such is the effect of the gift of lamps and of incense,<br>as also of bows and prostrations, to the deities. When food is cooked,<br>the first portion thereof should be offered to a Brahmana. The particular<br>offerings called Vali should also be presented to the household deities.<br>The deities become gratified with such gifts.[447] It is also well-known<br>that the measure of gratification which the deities derive from such<br>offerings is a hundred times as great as that which the householder<br>himself derives from making them. Persons endued with piety and wisdom<br>make offerings of incense and lights, accompanying them with bows and<br>prostrations. Such acts are always fraught with advancement and<br>prosperity to those that do them. Those rites which the learned go<br>through in course of their ablutions, and with the aid of waters,<br>accompanied with bows unto the gods, always contribute to the<br>gratification of the gods. When worshipped with proper rites, the highly<br>blessed Pitris, Rishis possessed of wealth of asceticism, and the<br>household deities, all become gratified. Filled with such ideas, Nahusha,<br>that great king, when he obtained the sovereignty of the deities,<br>observed all these rites and duties fraught with great glory. Some time<br>after the good fortune of Nahusha waned, and as the consequence thereof,<br>he disregarded all these observances and began to act in defiance of all<br>restraints in the manner I have already adverted to. The chief of the<br>deities, in consequence of his abstention from observing the ordinances<br>about the offers of incense and light, began to decline in energy. His<br>sacrificial rites and presents were obstructed by Rakshasas. It was at<br>this time that Nahusha yoked that foremost of Rishis, viz., Agastya, to<br>his car. Endued with great strength, Nahusha, smiling the while, set that<br>great Rishi quickly to the task, commanding him to bear the vehicle from<br>the banks of the Saraswati (to the place he would indicate). At this<br>time, Bhrigu, endued with great energy, addressed the son of Mitravaruna,<br>saying, 'Do thou close thy eyes till I enter into the matted locks on thy<br>head.' Having said this, Bhrigu of unfading glory and mighty energy<br>entered into the matted locks of Agastya who stood still like a wooden<br>post for hurling king Nahusha from the throne of Heaven. Soon after<br>Nahusha saw Agastya approach him for bearing his vehicle. Beholding the<br>lord of the deities Agastya addressed him, saying, 'Do thou yoke me to<br>thy vehicle without delay. To what region shall I bear thee? O lord of<br>the deities, I shall bear thee to the spot which thou mayst be pleased to<br>direct.' Thus addressed by him, Nahusha caused the ascetic to be yoked to<br>his vehicle. Bhrigu, who was staying within the matted locks of Agastya,<br>became highly pleased at this act of Nahusha. He took care not to cast<br>his eyes upon Nahusha. Fully acquainted with the energy which the<br>illustrious Nahusha had acquired in consequence of the boon which Brahman<br>had granted him, Bhrigu conducted himself in this way. Agastya also,<br>though treated by Nahusha in this way, did not give way to wrath. Then, O<br>Bharata, king Nahusha urged Agastya on with, his goad. The<br>righteous-souled Rishi did not still give way to anger. The lord of the<br>deities, himself giving way to anger, then struck Agastya on the head<br>with his left foot. When the Rishi was thus struck on the head, Bhrigu,<br>who was staying within Agastya's matted locks, became incensed and cursed<br>Nahusha of sinful soul, saying, 'Since thou hast struck with thy foot on<br>the head of this great Rishi, do thou, therefore, fall down on the earth,<br>transformed into a snake, O wretch of wicked understanding!' Thus cursed<br>by Bhrigu who had not been seen. Nahusha immediately became transformed<br>into a snake and fell down on the earth, O chief of Bharata's race! If O<br>monarch, Nahusha had seen Bhrigu, the latter would not then have<br>succeeded, by his energy, in hurling the former down on the earth. In<br>consequence of the various gifts that Nahusha had made, as also his<br>penances and religious observances though hurled down on the earth, O<br>king, he succeeded in retaining his memory. He then began to propitiate<br>Bhrigu with a view to the working out of the course. Agastya also, filled<br>with compassion, joined Nahusha in pacifying Bhrigu for bringing about an<br>end of the course. At last Bhrigu felt compassion for Nahusha and<br>provided' for the working out of the course.'<br><br>'Bhrigu said, 'There will appear a king (on earth) of the name of<br>Yudhishthira, the foremost of his race. He will rescue thee from this<br>curse.' Having said this, the Rishi vanished in the very sight of<br>Nahusha. Agastya also, of mighty energy, having thus accomplished the<br>business of the true Indra, that performer of a hundred sacrifices,<br>returned to his own asylum, worshipped by all members of the regenerate<br>order. Thou hast, O king, rescued Nahusha from Bhrigu's curse. Verily,<br>rescued by thee, he ascended to the region of Brahman in thy sight. As<br>regards Bhrigu, having hurled Nahusha on the earth, he went to the region<br>of Brahman and informed the Grandsire of it. The Grandsire, having called<br>Indra back, addressed the deities, saying. 'Ye deities, through the boon<br>I had granted him, Nahusha had obtained the sovereignty of heaven.<br>Deprived, however, of that sovereignty by the enraged Agastya, he has<br>been hurled on the earth. Ye deities, ye will not succeed in living<br>without a chief. Do ye, therefore, once more install Indra in the<br>sovereignty of Heaven.' Unto the Grandsire, O son of Pritha, who said so<br>unto them, the deities filled with joy, replied, saying, 'So be it!' The<br>divine Brahman then, O best of monarchs, installed Indra in the<br>sovereignty of heaven. Made once more the chief' of the deities, Vasava<br>began to shine in beauty and resplendence. Even this is what occurred in<br>days of yore through the transgression of Nahusha. In consequence,<br>however, of the merits he had acquired through acts of the kind I have<br>mentioned Nahusha succeeded in once more regaining his lost position.<br>Hence, when evening comes, persons leading the domestic mode of life<br>should give lights. The giver of lights is sure to acquire celestial<br>sight after death. Verily, givers of light become as resplendent as the<br>full moon. The giver of lights becomes endued with beauty of form and<br>strength for as many years as correspond with the number of twinkles for<br>which the lights given by him burn or blaze.'"[448]
