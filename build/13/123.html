                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O thou that art conversant with all duties, I desire<br>to hear, in detail, what the excellent behaviour is of good and chaste<br>women. Do thou, O grandsire, discourse to me on this.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Once on a time, in the celestial regions, a lady named<br>Sumana of Kekaya's race addressing Sandili possessed of great energy and<br>conversant with the truth relating to everything and endued with<br>omniscience, said, 'By what conduct, O auspicious lady, by what course of<br>acts, hast thou succeeded in attaining to heaven, purged of every sin?<br>Thou blazest forth with thy own energy like a flame of fire. Thou seemest<br>to be a daughter of the Lord of stars, come to heaven in thy own<br>effulgence. Thou wearest vestments of pure white, and art quite cheerful<br>and at thy ease. Seated on that celestial chariot, thou shinest, O<br>auspicious dame, with energy multiplied a thousandfold. Thou hast not, I<br>ween, attained to this region of happiness by inconsiderable penances and<br>gifts and vows. Do thou tell me the truth'. Thus questioned sweetly by<br>Sumana, Sandili of sweet smiles, addressing her fair interrogatrix, thus<br>answered her out of the hearing of others, I did not wear yellow robes;<br>nor barks of trees. I did not shave my head; nor did I keep matted locks<br>on my head. It is not in consequence of these acts that I have attained<br>to the status of a celestial. I never, in heedlessness, addressed any<br>disagreeable or evil speech to my husband. I was always devoted to the<br>worship of the deities, the Pitris, and the Brahmanas. Always heedful I<br>waited upon and served my mother-in-law and father-in-law. Even this was<br>my resolution that I should never behave with deceit. I never used to<br>stay at the door of our house nor did I speak long with anybody. I never<br>did any evil act; I never laughed aloud; I never did any injury. I never<br>disclosed any secret. Even thus did I bear myself always. When my<br>husband, having left home upon any business, used to come back, I always<br>served him by giving him a seat, and worshipped him with reverence. I<br>never ate food of any kind which was unknown to my husband and at which<br>my husband was not pleased. Rising at early dawn I did and caused to be<br>done whatever was brought about and required to be accomplished for the<br>sake of relatives and kinsmen. When my husband leaves home for going to a<br>distant place on any business, I remain at home engaged in diverse kinds<br>of auspicious acts for blessing his enterprise. Verily, during the<br>absence of my husband I never use collyrium, or ornaments; I never wash<br>myself properly or use garlands and unguents, or deck my feet with<br>lac-dye, or person with ornaments. When my husband sleeps in peace I<br>never awake him even if important business required his attention. I was<br>happy to sit by him lying asleep. I never urged my husband to exert more<br>energetically for earning wealth to support his family and relatives. I<br>always kept secrets without disclosing them to others. I used to keep<br>always our premises clean. That woman who with concentrated attention,<br>adheres to this path of duty, becomes the recipient of considerable<br>honours in heaven like a second Arundhati.'<br><br>''Bhishma continued, 'The illustrious and highly blessed Sandili, of<br>righteous conduct, having said these words unto Sumana on the subject of<br>woman's duties towards her husband, disappeared there and then. That man,<br>O son of Pandu, who reads this narrative at every full moon and new moon,<br>succeeds in attaining to heaven and enjoying great felicity in the woods<br>of Nandana."
