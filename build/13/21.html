                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me why had that lady no fear of Ashtavakra's<br>curse although Ashtavakra was endued with great energy? How also did<br>Ashtavakra succeed in coming back from that place?'"<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Ashtavakra asked her, saying,&#8212;How dost thou succeed in<br>altering thy form so? Thou shouldst not say anything that is untrue. I<br>wish to know this. Speakest thou truly before a Brahmana.'<br><br>"The lady said, 'O best of Brahmana, wherever thou mayst reside in heaven<br>or on Earth, this desire of union between the sexes is to be observed. O<br>thou of infallible prowess, listen, with concentrated attention, to this<br>all. This trial was devised by me. O sinless one, for testing thee<br>aright. O thou of infallible prowess, thou hast subjugated all the worlds<br>for not foregoing your previous resolution. Know that I am the embodiment<br>of the Northern point of the compass. Thou hast seen the lightness of the<br>female character. Even women that are aged are tortured by the desire of<br>sexual union. The Grandsire himself and all the deities with Indra have<br>been pleased with thee. The object for which thy illustrious self has<br>come here (is known to me). O foremost of regenerate persons, thou hast<br>been despatched higher by the Rishi Vadanya&#8212;the father of thy bride&#8212;in<br>order that I may instruct thee. Agreeably to the wishes of that Rishi I<br>have already instructed thee. Thou wilt return home in safety. Thy<br>journey back will not be toilsome. Thou wilt obtain for wife and girl<br>thou hast chosen. She will bear thee a son. Through desire I had<br>solicited thee, thou madest me the very best answer. The desire for<br>sexual union is incapable of being transcended in the three worlds. Go<br>back to thy quarters, having achieved such merit. What else is there that<br>thou wishest to hear from me? I shall discourse on it, O Ashtavakra, in<br>accordance with the truth. I was gratified by the Rishi Vadanya in the<br>first instance for thy sake, O regenerate ascetic For the sake of<br>honouring him, I have said all this to thee.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Hearing these words of hers, the regenerate<br>Ashtavakra joined his hands in a reverential attitude. He then solicited<br>the lady for her permission to go back. Obtaining the permission he came<br>back to his own asylum. Resting himself for some time at home and<br>obtaining the permission of his kinsmen and friends, he then in a proper<br>way, proceeded, O delighter of the Kurus, to the Brahmana Vadanya.<br>Welcomed with the usual enquiries by Vadanya, the Rishi Ashtavakra, with<br>a well-pleased heart, narrated all that he had seen (in course of his<br>sojourn to the North). He said,&#8212;Commanded by thee I proceeded to the<br>mountains of Gandhamadana. In the regions lying to the north of these<br>mountains I beheld a very superior goddess. I was received by her with<br>courtesy. She named you in my hearing and also instructed me in various<br>matters. Having listened to her I have come back, O lord. Unto him that<br>said so, the learned Vadanya said,&#8212;Take my daughter's hand according to<br>due rites and under the proper constellations. Thou art the fittest<br>bridegroom I can select for the girl.'<br><br>'Bhishma continued, 'Ashtavakra said,&#8212;So be it and took the hand of the<br>girl. Indeed, the highly righteous Rishi, having espoused the girl,<br>became filled with joy. Having taken as his wife that beautiful damsel,<br>the Rishi continued to dwell in his own asylum, freed from (mental) fever<br>of every kind.'"
