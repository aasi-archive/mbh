                            "Bhishma said, 'In days of yore, king Saudasa born of Ikshvaku's race,<br>that foremost of eloquent men, on one occasion approached his family<br>priest, viz., Vasishtha, that foremost of Rishis, crowned with ascetic<br>success, capable of wandering through every region, the receptacle of<br>Brahma, and endued with eternal life and put him the following question.'<br><br>"Saudasa said, 'O holy one, O sinless one, what is that in the three<br>worlds which is sacred and by reciting which at all times a man may<br>acquire high merit?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Unto king Saudasa who stood before him with head bent in<br>reverence, the learned Vasishtha having first bowed unto kine and<br>purified himself (in body and mind), discoursed upon the mystery relating<br>to kine, a topic that is fraught with result highly beneficial to all<br>persons.'<br><br>"Vasishtha said, 'Kine are always fragrant. The perfume emanated by the<br>exudation of the Amytis agallochum issues out of the bodies. Kine are the<br>great refuge of all creatures. Kine constitute the great source of<br>blessing unto all.[374] Kine are the Past and the Future. Kine are the<br>source of eternal growth. Kine are the root of Prosperity. Anything given<br>to kine is never lost. Kine constitute the highest food. They are the<br>best Havi for the deities. The Mantras called Swaha and Vashat are<br>forever established in kine. Kine constitute the fruit of sacrifices.<br>Sacrifices are established in kine. Kine are the Future and the Past, and<br>Sacrifice rest on them. Morning and evening kine yield unto the Rishis, O<br>foremost of men, Havi for use in Homa, O thou of great effulgence. They<br>who make gift of kine succeed in transcending all sins which they may<br>have committed and all kinds of calamities into which they may fall, O<br>thou of great puissance. The man possessing ten kine and making a gift of<br>one cow, he possessing a hundred kine and making a gift of ten kine, and<br>he possessing a thousand kine and making a gift of a hundred kine, all<br>earn the same measure of merit. The man who, though possessed of hundred<br>kine, does not establish a domestic fire for daily worship, that man who<br>though possessed of a thousand kine does not perform sacrifices, and that<br>man who though possessed of wealth acts as a miser (by not making gift<br>and discharging the duties of hospitality), are all three regarded as not<br>worthy of any respect. Those men who make gift of Kapila king with their<br>calves and with vessel of white brass for milking them,&#8212;kine, that is,<br>which are not vicious and which while given away, are wrapped round with<br>cloths,&#8212;succeed in conquering both this and the other world. Such<br>persons as succeed in making gift of a bull that is still in the prime of<br>youth, that has all its senses strong, and that may be regarded as the<br>foremost one among hundreds of herds, that has large horns adorned with<br>ornaments (of gold or silver), unto a Brahmana possessed of Vedic<br>learning, succeed, O scorcher of foes, its attaining to great prosperity<br>and affluence each time they take birth in the world. One should never go<br>to bed without reciting the names of kine. Nor should one rise from bed<br>in the morning without a similar recitation of the names of kine. Morning<br>and evening one should bend one's head in reverence to kine. As the<br>consequence of such acts, one is sure to attain to great prosperity. One<br>should never feel any repugnance for the urine and the dung of the cow.<br>One should never eat the flesh of kine. As the consequence of this, one<br>is sure to attain to great prosperity. One should always take the names<br>of kine. One should never show any disregard for kine in any way. If evil<br>dreams are seen, men should take the names of kine. One should always<br>bathe, using cow-dung at the time. One should sit on dried cowdung. One<br>should never cast one's urine and excreta and other secretions on<br>cowdung. One should never obstruct kine in any way. One should eat,<br>sitting on a cowhide purified by dipping it in water, and then cast one's<br>eyes towards the west, Sitting with restrained speech, one should eat<br>ghee, using the bare earth as one's dish. One reaps, in consequence of<br>such acts, that prosperity of which kine are the source[375]. One should<br>pour libations on the fire, using ghee for the purpose. One should cause<br>Brahmanas to utter blessings upon one, by presents of ghee. One should<br>make gift of ghee. One should also eat ghee. As the reward of such acts<br>one is sure to attain to that prosperity which kine confer. That man who<br>inspires a vaccine form made of sesame seeds by uttering the Vedic<br>Mantras called by the name of Gomati, and then adorns that form with<br>every kind of gems and makes a gift of it, has never to suffer any grief<br>on account of all his acts of omission and commission,&#8212;Let kine that<br>yield copious measures of milk and that have horns adorned with<br>gold,&#8212;kine viz., that are Surabhis or the daughters of<br>Surabhis.&#8212;approach me even as rivers approach the ocean! I always look<br>at kine. Let kine always look at me. Kine are ours. We are theirs.<br>Ourselves are there where kine are!&#8212;Even thus, at night or day, in<br>happiness or woe, verily, at times of even great fear,&#8212;should a man<br>exclaim. By uttering such words he is certain to become freed from every<br>fear.'"
