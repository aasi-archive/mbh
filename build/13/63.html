                            "Yudhishthira said, 'When a king becomes desirous of making gifts in this<br>world, what, indeed, are those gifts which he should make, O best of the<br>Bharatas, unto such Brahmanas as are possessed of superior<br>accomplishments? What gift is that by which the Brahmanas become<br>immediately gratified? What fruits do they bestow in return? O thou of<br>mighty arms, tell me what is the high reward attainable through the merit<br>arising from gifts. What gifts, O king, are productive of rewards both<br>here and hereafter? I desire to hear all this from thee. Do thou<br>discourse to me on all this in detail.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'These very questions were on a former occasion put by me<br>to Narada of celestial appearance. Hear me as I recite to thee what that<br>celestial sage told me in reply.'<br><br>"Narada said, 'The deities and all the Rishis applaud food. The course of<br>the world and the intellectual faculties have all been established on<br>food. There has never been, nor will be any gift that is equal to the<br>gifts of food. Hence, men always desire particularly to make gifts of<br>food. In this world, food is the cause of energy and strength. The<br>life-breaths are established on food. It is food that upholds the wide<br>universe, O puissant one. All classes of men, householders and mendicants<br>and ascetics, exist, depending upon food. The life-breaths depend upon<br>food. There is no doubt in this. Afflicting (if need be) one's relatives,<br>one is desirous of one's own prosperity, should make gifts of food unto a<br>high-souled Brahmana or a person of the mendicant order. That man who<br>makes a gift of food unto an accomplished Brahmana who solicits the same,<br>secures for himself in the world to come wealth of great value. The<br>householder who is desirous of his own prosperity should receive with<br>reverence a deserving old man that is spent with toil while proceeding on<br>his way far from home, when such a man honours the householder's abode<br>with his presence. That man who, casting off wrath that overleaps every<br>bound and becoming righteous in disposition and freed from malice, makes<br>gifts of food, is sure to attain to happiness, O king, both here and<br>hereafter. The householder should never disregard the man that comes to<br>his abode, nor should he insult him by sending him away. A gift of food<br>made unto even a Chandala or a dog is never lost. That man who makes a<br>gift of clean food unto a person on the way who is toil-worn and unknown<br>to the giver, is sure to acquire great merit. The man who gratifies with<br>gifts of food the Pitris, the deities, the Rishis, the Brahmanas, and<br>guests arrived at his abode, acquires merit whose measure is very large.<br>That person who having committed even a heinous sin makes a gift of food<br>unto one that solicits, or unto a Brahmana, is never stupefied by that<br>heinous sin. A gift of food made unto a Brahmana becomes inexhaustible.<br>One made to a Sudra becomes productive of great merit. Even this is the<br>difference between the merits that attach to gifts of food made unto<br>Brahmanas and Sudras. Solicited by it Brahmana, one should not enquire<br>about his race or conduct or Vedic lore. Asked for food, one should give<br>food to him that asks. There is no doubt in tits, O king, that he who<br>makes gifts of food obtains both here and hereafter many trees yielding<br>food and every other object of desire. Like tillers expecting auspicious<br>showers of rain, the Pitris always expect that their sons and grandsons<br>would make offerings unto them of food (in Sraddhas). The Brahmana is a<br>great being. When he comes into one's anode and solicits, saying, 'Give<br>me,' the owner of the abode, whether influenced or not by the desire of<br>acquiring merit, is sure to win great merit by listening to that<br>solicitation. The Brahmana is the guest of all creatures in the universe.<br>He is entitled to the first portion of every food. That house Increases<br>in prosperity to which the Brahmanas repair from desire of soliciting<br>alms and from which they return honoured in consequence of their desires<br>being fulfilled. The owner of such a house takes birth in his next life<br>in a family, O Bharata, that can command all the comforts and luxuries of<br>life. A man, by making gifts of food in this world, is sure to attain to<br>an excellent place hereafter. He who makes gifts of sweetmeat and all<br>food that is sweet, attains to a residence in heaven where he is honoured<br>by all the deities and other denizens. Food constitutes the life-breath<br>of men. Everything is established upon food. He who makes gifts of food<br>obtains many animals (as his wealth), many children, considerable wealth<br>(in other shape), and a command in abundance of all articles of comfort<br>and luxurious enjoyment. The giver of food is said to be the giver of<br>life. Indeed, he is said to be the giver of everything. Hence, O king,<br>such a man acquires both strength and beauty of form in this world. If<br>food be given duly unto a Brahmana arrived at the giver's house as a<br>guest, the giver attains to great happiness, and is adored by the very<br>deities. The Brahmana, O Yudhishthira, is a great being. He is also a<br>fertile field. Whatever seed is sown on that field produces an abundant<br>crop of merit. A gift of food is visibly and immediately productive of<br>the happiness of both the giver and the receiver. All other gifts produce<br>fruits that are unseen. Food is the origin of all creatures. From food,<br>comes happiness and delight. O Bharata, know that religion and wealth<br>both flow from food. The cure of disease or health also flows from food.<br>In a former Kalpa, the Lord of all creatures said that food is Amrita or<br>the source of immortality. Food is Earth, food is Heaven, food is the<br>Firmament. Everything is established on food. In the absence of food, the<br>five elements that constitute the physical organism cease to exist in a<br>state of union. From absence of food the strength of even the strongest<br>man is seen to fail. Invitations and marriages and sacrifices all cease<br>in the absence of food. The very Vedas disappear when food there is none.<br>Whatever mobile and immobile creatures exist in the universe are<br>dependent on food. Religion and wealth, in the three worlds, are all<br>dependent on food. Hence the wise should make gifts of food. The<br>strength, energy, fame and achievements of the man who makes gifts of<br>food, constantly increase in the three worlds, O king. The lord of the<br>life-breaths, viz., the deity of wind, places above the clouds (the water<br>sucked up by the Sun). The water thus borne to the clouds is caused by<br>Sakra to be poured upon the earth, O Bharata. The Sun, by means of his<br>rays, sucks up the moisture of the earth. The deity of wind causes the<br>moisture to fall down from the Sun.[333] When the water falls down from<br>the clouds upon the Earth, the goddess Earth becomes moist, O Bharata.<br>Then do people sow diverse kinds of crops upon whose outturn the universe<br>of creatures depends. It is in the food thus produced that the flesh,<br>fat, bones and vital seed of all beings have their origin. From the vital<br>seed thus originated, O king, spring diverse kinds of living creatures.<br>Agni and Soma, the two agents living within the body, create and maintain<br>the vital seed. Thus from food, the Sun and the deity of wind and the<br>vital seed spring and act. All these are said to constitute one element<br>or quantity, and it is from these that all creatures spring. That man who<br>gives food into one who comes into his house and solicits it, is said, O<br>chief of the Bharatas, to contribute both life and energy unto living<br>creatures.'<br><br>'Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by Narada, O king, I have always made<br>gifts of food. Do thou also, therefore, freed from malice and with a<br>cheerful heart, make gifts of food. By making gifts of food, O king, unto<br>deserving Brahmanas with due rites, thou mayst be sure, O puissant one,<br>of attaining to Heaven. Hear me, O monarch, as I tell thee what the<br>regions are that are reserved for those that make gifts of food. The<br>mansions of those high-souled persons shine with resplendence in the<br>regions of Heaven. Bright as the stars in the firmament, and supported<br>upon many columns, white as the disc of the moon, and adorned with many<br>tinkling bells, and rosy like the newly-risen sun, those palatial abodes<br>are either fixed or movable. Those mansions are filled with hundreds upon<br>hundreds of things and animals that live on land and as many things and<br>animals living in water. Some of them are endued with the effulgence of<br>lapis lazuli and some are possessed of the resplendence of the sun. Some<br>of them are made of silver and some of gold. Within those mansions are<br>many trees capable of crowning with fruition every desire of the inmates.<br>Many tanks and roads and halls and well and lakes occur all around.<br>Thousands of conveyances with horses and other animals harnessed thereto<br>and with wheels whose clatter is always loud, may be seen there.<br>Mountains of food and all enjoyable articles and heaps of cloths and<br>ornaments are also to be seen there. Numerous rivers that run milk, and<br>hills of rice and other edibles, may also be seen there. Indeed, many<br>palatial residences looking like white clouds, with many beds of golden<br>splendour, occur in those regions, All these are obtained by those men<br>that make gifts of food in this world. Do thou, therefore, become a giver<br>of food. Verily, these are the regions that are reserved for those<br>high-souled and righteous persons that make gifts of food in this world.<br>For these reasons, men should always make gifts of food in this world.'"
