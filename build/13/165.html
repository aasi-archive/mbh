                            "Vaisampayana said, 'That perpetuator of Kuru's race, viz., Yudhishthira<br>the son of Pandu, desirous of obtaining such good as is destructive of<br>sins, questioned Bhishma who was lying on a bed of arrows, (in the<br>following words).'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'What, indeed, is beneficial for a person in this<br>world? What is that by doing which one may earn happiness? By what may<br>one be cleansed of all one's sins? Indeed, what is that which is<br>destructive of sins?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'In this connection, the royal son of Santanu, O<br>foremost of men, duly recited the names of the deities unto Yudhishthira<br>who was desirous of hearing.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O son, the following names of the deities with those of<br>the Rishis, if duly recited morning, noon, and evening, become<br>efficacious cleansers of all sins. Acting with the aid of one's senses<br>(or knowledge and action), whatever sins one may commit by day or by<br>night or by the two twilights, consciously, or unconsciously one is sure<br>to be cleansed therefrom and become thoroughly pure by reciting these<br>names. One that takes those names has never to become blind or deaf;<br>indeed, by taking those names, one always succeeds in attaining to what<br>is beneficial. Such a man never takes birth in the intermediate order of<br>beings, never goes to hell, and never becomes a human being of any of the<br>mixed castes. He has never to fear the accession of any calamity. When<br>death comes, he never becomes stupefied. The master of all the deities<br>and Asuras, resplendent with effulgence, worshipped by all creatures,<br>inconceivable, indescribable, the life of all living beings, and unborn,<br>is the Grandsire Brahma, the Lord of the universe. His chaste spouse is<br>Savitri. Then comes that origin of the Vedas, the creator Vishnu,<br>otherwise called Narayana of immeasurable puissance. Then comes the<br>three-eyed Lord of Lima; then Skanda the generalissimo of the celestial<br>forces; then Visakha; then Agni the eater of sacrificial libations; then<br>Vayu the god of wind; then Chandramas; then Aditya the god of the sun,<br>endued with effulgence; then the illustrious Sakra the lord of Sachi; and<br>Yama with his spouse Dhumorna; and Varuna with Gauri; Kuvera the lord of<br>treasures, with his spouse Riddhi; the amiable and illustrious cow<br>Surabhi; the great Rishi Visravas; Sankalpa, Ocean, Gangs: the other<br>sacred Rivers; the diverse Maruts; the Valkhilyas crowned with success of<br>penances; the island-born Krishna; Narada; Parvata; Viswavasu; the Hahas;<br>the Huhus; Tumvuru; Chitrasena; the celestial messenger of wide<br>celebrity; the highly blessed celestial maidens; the celestial Apsaras,<br>Urvasi, Menaka, Rambha; Misrakesi, Alamvusha, Viswachi, Ghritachi,<br>Panchachuda, Tilottama, the Adityas, the Vasus, the Aswins, the Pitris;<br>Dharma (Righteousness); Vedic lore, Penances, Diksha, Perseverance (in<br>religious acts), the Grandsire, Day and Night, Kasyapa the son of<br>Marichi, Sukra, Vrihaspati, Mangala the son of Earth, Vudha, Rahu,<br>Sanischara, the Constellations, the Seasons, the Months, the Fortnights,<br>the Year, Garuda, the son of Vinata, the several Oceans, the sons of<br>Kadru, viz., the Snakes, Satadru, Vipasa, Chandrabhaga, Saraswati,<br>Sindhu, Devika, Prabhasa, the lakes of Pushkara, Ganga, Mahanadi, Vena,<br>Kaveri, Narmada, Kulampuna Visalya, Karatoya, Amvuvahini. Sarayu,<br>Gandaki, the great river Lohita, Tamra, Aruna, Vetravati, Parnasa,<br>Gautami, the Godavari, Vena, Krishnavena, Dwija, Drishadvati, Kaveri,<br>Vankhu, Mandakini Prayaga, Prabhasa, the sacred Naimisha, the spot sacred<br>to Visweswara or Mahadeva, viz., Kasi, that lake of crystal water,<br>Kurukshetra full of many sacred waters, the foremost of oceans (viz., the<br>ocean of milk), Penances, Gifts, Jamvumarga, Hiranwati, Vitasta, the<br>river Plakshavati, Vedasmriti, Vedavati, Malava, Aswavati, all sacred<br>spots on Earth, Gangadwara, the sacred Rishikulya, the river Chitravaha,<br>the Charmanwati, the sacred river Kausiki, the Yamuna, the river<br>Bhimarathi, the great river Vahuda, Mahendravani, Tridiva Nilika,<br>Saraswati, Nanda, the other Nanda, the large sacred lake, Gaya,<br>Phalgutirtha Dharmarayana (the sacred forest) that is peopled with the<br>deities, the sacred celestial river, the lake created by the Grandsire<br>Brahma which is sacred and celebrated over the three worlds, and<br>auspicious and capable of cleansing all sins, the Himavat mountain endued<br>with excellent herbs, the Vindhya mountain variegated with diverse kinds<br>of metals, containing many Tirthas and overgrown with medicinal herbs.<br>Meru, Mahendra, Malaya, Sweta endued with silver, Sringavat, Mandara,<br>Nila, Nishada, Dardurna, Chitrakuta, Anjanabha, the Gandhamadana<br>mountains; the sacred Somagiri, the various other mountains, the cardinal<br>points of the compass, the subsidiary points, the Earth, all the trees,<br>the Viswedevas, the Firmament, the Constellations, the Planets, and the<br>deities,&#8212;let these all, named and unnamed, rescue and cleanse us! The<br>man who takes the names of these becomes cleansed of all his sins. By<br>hymning their praises and gratifying them, one becomes freed from every<br>fear. Verily, the man who delights in uttering the hymns in praise of the<br>deities becomes cleansed of all such sins as lead to birth in impure<br>orders. After this recital of the deities, I shall name those learned<br>Brahmanas crowned with ascetic merit and success and capable of cleaning<br>one of every sin. They are Yavakrita and Raibhya and Kakshivat and<br>Aushija, and Bhrigu and Angiras and Kanwa, and the puissant Medhatithi,<br>and Varhi possessed of every accomplishment. These all belong to the<br>eastern region. Others, viz., Unmuchu, Pramuchu, all highly blessed,<br>Swastyatreya of great energy, Agastya of great prowess, the son of Mitra<br>and Varuna; Dridhayu and Urdhavahu, those two foremost and celebrated of<br>Rishis,&#8212;these live in the southern region. Listen now to me as I name<br>those Rishis that dwell in the western region. They are Ushango with his<br>uterine brothers, Parivyadha of great energy, Dirghatamas, Gautama,<br>Kasyapa, Ekata, Dwita, Trita, the righteous-souled son of Atri (viz.,<br>Durvasa), and puissant Saraswat. Listen now to me as I name those Rishis<br>that worship the deities in sacrifices, dwelling in the northern region.<br>They are Atri, Vasishtha, Saktri, Parasara's son Vyasa of great energy;<br>Viswamitra, Bharadwaja, Jamadagni, the son of Richika, Rama, Auddalaka,<br>Swetaketu, Kohala, Vipula, Devala, Devasarman, Dhaumya, Hastikasyapa,<br>Lomasa, Nachiketa, Lomaharsana, Ugrasravas, and Bhrigu's son Chyavana.<br>This is the tale of Rishis possessed of Vedic lore. They are primeval<br>Rishis, O king, whose names, if taken, are capable of cleansing one of<br>every sin. After this I shall recite the names of the principal kings.<br>They are Nriga, Yayati, Nahusha, Yadu, Puru of great energy, Sagara,<br>Dhundhumara, Dilipa of great prowess, Krisaswa, Yauvanaswa, Chitraswa,<br>Satyavat, Dushmanta, Bharata who became an illustrious Emperor over many<br>kings, Yavana, Janaka, Dhrishtaratha, Raghu, that foremost of kings,<br>Dasaratha, the heroic Rama, that slayer of Rakshasas, Sasavindu.<br>Bhagiratha, Harischandra, Marutta, Dridharatha, the highly fortunate<br>Alarka, Aila, Karandhama, that foremost of men, Kasmira, Daksha,<br>Amvarisha, Kukura, Raivata of great fame, Kuru, Samvarana, Mandhatri of<br>unbaffled prowess, the royal sage Muchukunda, Jahnu who was much favoured<br>by Janhavi (Ganga), the first (in point of time) of all kings, viz.,<br>Prithu the son of Vena, Mitrabhanu, Priyankara, Trasadasyu, Sweta that<br>foremost of royal sages, the celebrated Mahabhisha, Nimi Ashtaka, Ayu,<br>the royal sage Kshupa, Kaksheyu, Pratardana, Devodasa, Sudasa,<br>Kosaleswara, Aila, Nala, the royal sage Manu, that lord of all creatures,<br>Havidhara, Prishadhara, Pratipa, Santanu, Aja, the senior Varhi, Ikshwaku<br>of great fame, Anaranya, Janujangha, the royal sage Kakshasena, and many<br>others not named (in history). That man who rising at early dawn takes<br>the names of these kings at the two twilights, viz., at sunset and<br>sunrise, with a pure body and mind and without distracted attention,<br>acquires great religious merit. One should hymn the praises of the<br>deities, the celestial Rishis, and the royal sages and say, 'These lords<br>of the creation will ordain my growth and long life and fame! Let no<br>calamity be mine, let no sin defile me, and let there be no opponents or<br>enemies of mine! Without doubt, victory will always be mine and an<br>auspicious end hereafter!'"
