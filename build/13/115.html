                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast told it many times that abstention from<br>injury is the highest religion. In Sraddhas, however, that are performed<br>in honour of the Pitris, persons for their own good should make offerings<br>of diverse kinds of meat. Thou hast said so while discoursing formerly<br>upon the ordinances in respect of Sraddhas. How can meat, however, be<br>procured without slaying a living creature? Thy declarations, therefore,<br>seem to me to be contradictory. A doubt has, therefore, arisen in our<br>mind respecting the duty of abstaining from meat. What are the faults<br>that one incurs by eating meat, and what are the merits that one wins?<br>What are the demerits of him who eats meat by himself killing a living<br>creature? What are the merits of him who eats the meat of animals killed<br>by others? What the merits and demerits of him who kills a living<br>creature for another? Or of him who eats meat buying it of others? I<br>desire, O sinless one, that thou shouldst discourse to me on this topic<br>in detail. I desire to ascertain this eternal religion with certainty.<br>How does one attain to longevity? How does one acquire strength? How does<br>one attain to faultlessness of limbs? Indeed, how does one become endued<br>with excellent indications?<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen to me, O, scion of Kuru's race, what the merit is<br>that attaches to abstention from meat. Listen to me as I declare to thee<br>what the excellent ordinances, in truth, are on this head. Those<br>high-souled persons who desire beauty, faultlessness of limbs, long life,<br>understanding, mental and physical strength, and memory, should abstain<br>from acts of injury. On this topic, O scion of Kuru's race, innumerable<br>discourses took place between the Rishis. Listen, O Yudhishthira, what<br>their opinion was. The merit acquired by that person, O Yudhishthira,<br>who, with the steadiness of a vow, adores the deities every month in<br>horse-sacrifices, is equal to his who discards honey and meat. The seven<br>celestial Rishis, the Valakhilyas, and those Rishis who drink the rays of<br>the sun, endued with great wisdom, applaud abstention from meat. The<br>Self-born Manu has said that that man who does not eat meat, or who does<br>not slay living creatures, or who does not cause them to be slain, is a<br>friend of all creatures. Such a man is incapable of being oppressed by<br>any creature. He enjoys the confidence of all living beings. He always<br>enjoys, besides, the approbation and commendation of the righteous. The<br>righteous-souled Narada has said that that man who wishes to increase his<br>own flesh by eating the flesh of other creatures, meets with calamity.<br>Vrihaspati has said that that man who abstains from honey and meat<br>acquires the merit of gifts and sacrifices and penances. In my<br>estimation, these two persons are equal, viz., he who adores the deities<br>every month in a horse-sacrifice for a space of hundred years and he who<br>abstains from honey and meat. In consequence of abstention from meat one<br>comes to be regarded as one who always adores the deities in sacrifices,<br>or as one who always makes gifts to others, or as one who always<br>undergoes the severest austerities. That man who having eaten meat gives<br>it up afterwards, acquires merit by such an act that is so great that a<br>study of all the Vedas or a performance, O Bharata, of all the<br>sacrifices, cannot bestow its like. It is exceedingly difficult to give<br>up meat after one has become acquainted with its taste. Indeed, it is<br>exceedingly difficult for such a person to observe the high vow of<br>abstention from meat, a vow that assures every creature by dispelling all<br>fear. That learned person who giveth to all living creatures the Dakshina<br>of complete assurance comes to be regarded, without doubt, as the giver<br>of life-breaths in this world.[524] Even this is the high religion which<br>men of wisdom applaud. The life-breaths of other creatures are as dear to<br>them as those of one's to one's own self. Men endued with intelligence<br>and cleansed souls should always behave towards other creatures after the<br>manner of that behaviour which they like others to observe towards<br>themselves. It is seen that even those men who are possessed of learning<br>and who seek to achieve the highest good in the form of Emancipation, are<br>not free from the fear of death. What need there be said of those<br>innocent and healthy creatures endued with love of life, when they are<br>sought to be slain by sinful wretches subsisting by slaughter? For this<br>reason, O monarch, know that the discarding of meat is the highest refuge<br>of religion, of heaven, and of happiness. Abstention from injury is the<br>highest religion. It is, again, the highest penance. It is also the<br>highest truths from which all duty proceeds. Flesh cannot be had from<br>grass or wood or stone. Unless a living creature is slain, it cannot be<br>had. Hence is the fault in eating flesh. The deities who subsist upon<br>Swaha, Swadha, and nectar, are devoted to truth and sincerity. Those<br>persons, however, who are for gratifying the sensation of taste, should<br>be known as Rakshasas wedded to the attribute of Passion. That man who<br>abstains from meat, is never put in fear, O king, by any creature,<br>wherever he may be, viz., in terrible wildernesses or inaccessible<br>fastnesses, by day or by night, or at the two twilights, in the open<br>squares of towns or in assemblies of men, from upraised weapons or in<br>places where there is great fright from wild animals or snakes. All<br>creatures seek his protection. He is an object of confidence with all<br>creatures. He never causes any anxiety in others, and himself has never<br>to become anxious. If there were nobody who ate flesh there would then be<br>nobody to kill living creatures. The man who kills living creatures kill<br>them for the sake of the person who eats flesh. If flesh were regarded as<br>inedible, there would then be no slaughter of living creatures. It is for<br>the sake of the eater that the slaughter of living creatures goes on in<br>the world. Since, O thou of great splendour, the period of life is<br>shortened of persons who slaughter living creatures or cause them to be<br>slaughtered, it is clear that the person who wishes his own good should<br>give up meat entirely. Those fierce persons who are engaged in slaughter<br>of living creatures, never find protectors when they are in need. Such<br>persons should always be molested and persecuted even as beasts of prey.<br>Through cupidity or stupefaction of the understanding, for the sake of<br>strength and energy, or through association with the sinful, the<br>disposition manifests itself in men for sinning. That man who seeks to<br>increase his own flesh by (eating) the flesh of others, has to live in<br>this world in great anxiety and after death has to take birth in<br>indifferent races and families. High Rishis devoted to the observance of<br>vows and self-restraint have said that abstention from meat is worthy of<br>every praise, productive of fame and Heaven, and a great propitiation by<br>itself. This I heard in days of old, O son of Kunti, from Markandeya when<br>that Rishi discoursed on the demerits of eating flesh. He who eats the<br>flesh of animals that are desirous of living but that have been killed by<br>either himself or others, incurs the sin that attaches to the slaughter<br>for his this act of cruelty. He who purchases flesh slays living<br>creatures through his wealth. He who eats flesh slays living creatures<br>through such act of eating. He who binds or seizes and actually kills<br>living creatures is the slaughterer. Those are the three kinds of<br>slaughter, each of these three acts being so. He who does not himself eat<br>flesh but approves of an act of slaughter becomes stained with the sin of<br>slaughter. By abstaining from meat and showing compassion to all<br>creatures one becomes incapable of being molested by any creature, and<br>acquires a long life, perfect health, and happiness. The merit that is<br>acquired by a person by abstaining from meat, we have heard, is superior<br>to that of one who makes presents of gold, of kine, and of land. One<br>should never eat meat of animals not dedicated in sacrifices and that<br>are, therefore, slain for nothing, and that has not been offered to the<br>gods and Pitris with the aid of the ordinances. There is not the<br>slightest doubt that a person by eating such meat goes to Hell. If one<br>eats the meat that has been sanctified in consequence of its having been<br>procured from animals dedicated in sacrifices and that have been slain<br>for the purpose of feeding Brahmanas, one incurs a little fault. By<br>behaving otherwise, one becomes stained with sin. That wretch among men<br>who slays living creatures for the sake of those who would eat them,<br>incurs great demerit. The eater's demerit is not so great. That wretch<br>among men who, following the path of religious rites and sacrifices laid<br>down in the Vedas, would kill a living creature from desire of eating its<br>flesh, would certainly become a resident of hell. That man who having<br>eaten flesh abstains from it afterwards, attains to great merit in<br>consequence of such abstention from sin. He who arranges for obtaining<br>flesh, he who approves of those arrangements, he who slays, he who buys<br>or sells, he who cooks, and he who eats, are all regarded as eaters of<br>flesh. I shall now cite another authority, depending upon that was<br>declared by the ordainer himself, and established in the Vedas. It has<br>been said that that religion which has acts for its indications has been<br>ordained for householders, O chief of kings, and not for those men who<br>are desirous of emancipation. Mann himself has said that meat which is<br>sanctified with mantras and properly dedicated, according to the<br>ordinances of the Vedas, in rites performed in honour of the Pitris, is<br>pure. All other meat falls under the class of what is obtained by useless<br>slaughter, and is, therefore, uneatable, and leads to Hell and infamy.<br>One should never eat, O chief of Bharata's race, like a Rakshasa, any<br>meat that has been obtained by means not sanctioned by the ordinance.<br>Indeed, one should never eat flesh obtained from useless slaughter and<br>that has not been sanctified by the ordinance. That man who wishes to<br>avoid calamity of every kind should abstain from the meat of every living<br>creature. It is heard that in the ancient Kalpa, persons, desirous of<br>attaining to regions of merit hereafter, performed sacrifices with seeds,<br>regarding such animals as dedicated by them. Filled with doubts<br>respecting the propriety of eating flesh, the Rishis asked Vasu the ruler<br>of the Chedis for solving them. King Vasu, knowing that flesh is<br>inedible, answered that is was edible, O monarch. From that moment Vasu<br>fell down from the firmament on the earth. After this he once more<br>repeated his opinion, with the result that he had to sink below the earth<br>for it. Desirous of benefiting all men, the high-souled Agastya, by the<br>aid of his penances, dedicated, once for all, all wild animals of the<br>deer species to the deities. Hence, there is no longer any necessity of<br>sanctifying those animals for offering them to the deities and the<br>Pitris. Served with flesh according to the ordinance, the Pitris become<br>gratified. Listen to me, O king of kings, as I tell thee this, O sinless<br>one. There is complete happiness in abstaining from meat, O monarch. He<br>that undergoes severe austerities for a hundred years and he that<br>abstains from meat, are both equal in point of merit. Even this is my<br>opinion, In the lighted fortnight of the month of Karttika in especial,<br>one should abstain from honey and meat. In this, it has been ordained,<br>there is great merit. He who abstains from meat for the four months of<br>the rains acquires the four valued blessings of achievements, longevity,<br>fame and might. He who abstains for the whole month of Karttika from meat<br>of every kind, transcends all kinds of woe and lives in complete<br>happiness. They who abstain from flesh by either months or fortnights at<br>a stretch have the region of Brahma ordained for them in consequence of<br>their abstention from cruelty. Many kings in ancient days, O son of<br>Pritha, who had constituted themselves the souls of all creatures and who<br>were conversant with the truths of all things, viz., Soul and Not-soul,<br>had abstained from flesh either for the whole of the month of Karttika or<br>for the whole of the lighted fortnight in that month. They were Nabhaga<br>and Amvarisha and the high-souled Gaya and Ayu and Anaranya and Dilipa<br>and Raghu and Puru and Kartavirya and Aniruddha and Nahusha and Yayati<br>and Nrigas and Vishwaksena and Sasavindu and Yuvanaswa and Sivi, the son<br>of Usinara, and Muchukunda and Mandhatri, and Harischandra. Do thou<br>always speak the truth. Never speak an untruth. Truth is an eternal duty.<br>It is by truth that Harischandra roves through heaven like a second<br>Chandramas. These other kings also, viz., Syenachitra, O monarch, and<br>Somaka and Vrika and Raivata and Rantideva and Vasu and Srinjaya, and<br>Dushmanta and Karushma and Rama and Alarka and Nala, and Virupaswa and<br>Nimi and Janaka of great intelligence, and Aila and Prithu and Virasena,<br>and Ikshvaku, and Sambhu, and Sweta, and Sagara, and Aja and Dhundhu and<br>Suvahu, and Haryaswa and Kshupa and Bharata, O monarch, did not eat flesh<br>for the month of Karttika and as the consequence thereof attained to<br>heaven, and endued with prosperity, blazed forth with effulgence in the<br>region of Brahman, adored by Gandharvas and surrounded by thousand<br>damsels of great beauty. Those high-souled men who practise this<br>excellent religion which is characterised by abstention from injury<br>succeed in attaining to a residence in heaven. These righteous men who,<br>from the time of birth, abstain from honey and meat and wine, are<br>regarded as Munis. That man who practises this religion consisting of<br>abstention from meat or who recites it for causing others to hear it,<br>will never have to go to hell even if he be exceedingly wicked in conduct<br>in other respects. He, O king, who (often-times) reads these ordinances<br>about abstention from meat, that are sacred and adored by the Rishis, or<br>hears it read, becomes cleansed of every sin and attains to great<br>felicity in consequence of the fruition of every wish. Without doubt, he<br>attains also to a position of eminence among kinsmen. When afflicted with<br>calamity, he readily transcends it. When obstructed with impediments, he<br>succeeds in freeing himself from them with the utmost ease. When ill with<br>disease, he becomes cured speedily, and afflicted with sorrow he becomes<br>liberated from it with greatest ease. Such a man has never to take birth<br>in the intermediate order of animals or birds. Born in the order of<br>humanity, he attains to great beauty of person. Endued with great<br>prosperity, O chief of Kuru's race, he acquires great fame as well. I<br>have thus told thee, O king, all that should be said on the subject of<br>abstention from meat, together with the ordinances respecting both the<br>religion of Pravritti and Nivritti as framed by the Rishis."
