                            "Bhishma said, 'Beholding his disciple returned from his mission,<br>Devasarman of great energy addressed him in words which I shall recite to<br>thee O king!'<br><br>"Davasarman said, 'What hast thou seen, O Vipula, in course of thy<br>progress, O disciple, through the great forest' 'They whom thou hast seen<br>knew thee, O Vipula. I, as also my spouse Ruchi, know how thou hadst<br>acted in the matter of protecting Ruchi.'<br><br>"Vipula said, 'O regenerate Rishi, who are those two whom I first saw?<br>Who also are those other six whom I saw subsequently? All of them know<br>me: who, indeed, are they to whom thou alludest in thy speech to me?'<br><br>"Devasarman said, The first couple, O regenerate one, whom thou sawest,<br>are Day and Night. They are ceaselessly moving like a circle. Both of<br>them know the transgression of which thou hast been guilty, those other<br>men (six in number) whom, O learned Brahmana, thou sawest playing<br>cheerfully at dice, are the six Seasons. They also are acquainted with<br>thy transgressions. Having committed a sin in secrecy, no sinful man<br>should cherish the assuring thought that his transgression is known only<br>to himself and not to any one else. When a man perpetrates a sinful deed<br>in secret, the Seasons as also Day and Night behold it always. Those<br>regions that are reserved for the sinful shall be thine (for what thou<br>hast done) What thou hadst done thou didst not tell me. That thy sin was<br>not known to any one, was thy belief, and this conviction had filled thee<br>with joy. Thou didst not inform the preceptor of the whole truth,<br>choosing to hide from him a material portion. The Seasons, and Day and<br>Night, whom thou hast heard speak in that strain, thought it proper to<br>remind thee of thy transgression. Day and Night and the Seasons are ever<br>conversant of all the good and the bad deeds that are in a man. They<br>spoke to thee in that way, O regenerate one, because they have full<br>knowledge of what thou hadst done but which thou hadst not the courage to<br>inform me of, fearing thou hadst done wrong. For this reason those<br>regions that are reserved for the sinful will be thine as much. Thou<br>didst not tell me what thou hadst done. Thou weft fully capable, O<br>regenerate one, of protecting my spouse whose disposition by nature, is<br>sinful. In doing what thou didst, thou didst not commit any sin. I was,<br>for this, gratified with thee! O best of Brahmanas, if I had known thee<br>to have acted wickedly, I would without hesitation, have cursed thee.<br>Women become united with men. Such union is very desirable with men. Thou<br>hadst, however, protected my wife in a different spirit. If thou hadst<br>acted otherwise, a curse would have been uttered upon thee. Even this is<br>what I think. Thou hadst O son, protected my spouse. The manner in which<br>thou didst it hath now become known to me as if thou hadst thyself<br>informed me of it. I have, O son, become gratified with thee. Relieved of<br>all anxiety, thou shalt go to heaven!' Having said these words unto<br>Vipula, the great Rishi Devasarman, ascended to heaven with his wife and<br>his disciple and began to pass his time there in great happiness. In<br>course of conversation, O king, on a former occasion, the great ascetic<br>Markandeya had narrated to me this history on the banks of the Ganga. I,<br>therefore, recite to thee. Women should always be protected by thee (from<br>temptations and opportunities of every kind). Amongst them both kinds are<br>to be seen, that is, those that are virtuous and those that are not so.<br>Those women that are virtuous are highly blessed. They are the mothers of<br>the universe (for they it is that cherish all creatures on every side).<br>They, it is, O king, that uphold the earth with all her waters and<br>forests. Those women that are sinful, that are of wicked behaviour, that<br>are the destroyers of their races, and that are wedded to sinful<br>resolves, are capable of being ascertained by indications, expressive of<br>the evil that is in them, which appear, O king, on their bodies. It is<br>even thus that high-souled persons are capable of protecting women. They<br>cannot, O tiger among kings, be protected in any other way. Women, O<br>chief of men, are fierce. They are endued with fierce prowess. They have<br>none whom they love or like so much as they that have sexual congress<br>with them. Women are like those (Atharvan) incantations that are<br>destructive of life. Even after they have consented to live with one,<br>they are prepared to abandon him for entering into engagements with<br>others. They are never satisfied with one person of the opposite sex, O<br>son of Pandu! Men should feel no affection for them. Nor should they<br>entertain any jealousy on account of them, O king! having a regard only<br>for the considerations of virtue, men should enjoy their society, not<br>with enthusiasm and attachment but with reluctance and absence of<br>attachment. By acting otherwise, a man is sure to meet with destruction,<br>O delighter of the Kurus. Reason is respected at all times and under all<br>circumstances. Only one man, viz., Vipula, had succeeded in protecting<br>woman. There is none else, O king, in the three worlds who is capable of<br>protecting women.'"
