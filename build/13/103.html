                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast discoursed to us on diverse kinds of gift,<br>on tranquillity of soul, on Truth, on compassion, on contentment with<br>one's wedded wife, and the merits of gift. It is known to thee, O<br>grandsire, that there is nothing whose puissance is superior to that of<br>penances. It behoveth thee to expound to us what constitutes the highest<br>penances.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I tell thee, O Yudhishthira, that one attains to a region<br>of felicity that corresponds with the kind of penances that one observes.<br>This is what I hold, O son of Kunti, that there is no penance that is<br>superior to abstention from food! In this connection is recited the<br>ancient narrative of the discourse between Bhagiratha and the illustrious<br>Brahman (the Grandsire of the Creation). It has been heard by us, O<br>Bharata, that Bhagiratha attained to that region which transcends that of<br>the deities, of kine, and of the Rishis. Beholding this, O monarch, the<br>Grandsire Brahman, addressing Bhagiratha, said, 'How, O Bhagiratha, hast<br>thou attained to this region that is so difficult of attainment? Neither<br>the deities, nor Gandharvas, nor human beings, O Bhagiratha succeed in<br>coming here without having practised the severest austerities. How,<br>indeed, hast thou attained to this region?'<br><br>"Bhagiratha said, 'I used to make gifts of hundreds of thousands of gold<br>coin unto the Brahmanas, observing the Brahmacharya vow all the while, it<br>is not through the merit on those gifts, O learned one, that I have<br>attained to this region. I performed the Ekaratra sacrifice for ten<br>times, and the Pancharatra sacrifice for as many times. The Ekadasaratra<br>sacrifice was performed by me eleven times. The great sacrifice of<br>Jyotishtoma was performed by me a hundred times. It is not, however,<br>through the merits of those sacrifices that I have attained to this<br>region of felicity.[454] For a hundred years I lived continuously by the<br>side of the holy Jahnavi, all the while practising the severest<br>austerities. There I made gifts unto the Brahmanas of thousands of male<br>and female slaves. By the side of the Pushkara lakes I made gifts unto<br>the Brahmanas, for a hundred thousand times, a hundred thousand steeds,<br>and two hundred thousand kine. I also gave away a thousand damsels of<br>great beauty, each adorned with golden moons, and sixty thousand more<br>decked with ornaments of pure gold. It is not, however, through the<br>merits of those acts that I have succeeded in attaining to these<br>regions.[455] O lord of the universe, performing those sacrifices known<br>by the name of Gosava, I gave away ten Arvudas of kine, presenting each<br>Brahmana with ten kine, each of whom was accompanied with her calf, each<br>of whom yielded milk at the time, and with each of whom were given a<br>vessel of gold and one of white brass for milking her. Performing many<br>Soma sacrifices, I gave away unto each Brahmana ten kine each of whom<br>yielded milk, and each of whom had brought forth only her first calf,<br>besides making presents unto them of hundreds of kine belonging to that<br>species which is known by the name of Rohini. I also gave away unto the<br>Brahmanas twice ten Prayutas of other kine, all yielding milk. It is not<br>through the merit of those gifts, O Brahman, that I have succeeded in<br>attaining to this region of felicity. I also gave away a hundred thousand<br>horses of the Valhika breed, all white of complexion, and adorned with<br>garlands of gold. It is not, however, through the merits of those acts<br>that I have attained to this region. I gave away eight crores of golden<br>coins unto the Brahmanas, O Brahman, and then another ten crores also, in<br>each sacrifice that I performed. It is not, however, through the merits<br>of those acts that I have attained to this region of felicity. I also<br>gave away ten and then seven crores of steeds, O Grandsire, each of green<br>complexion, each having ears that were dark, and each adorned with<br>garlands of gold. I also gave away ten and seven thousand elephants of<br>huge size, of teeth as large as plough-shares, each having those whorls<br>on its body which are called Padmas, and each adorned with garlands of<br>gold. I gave away ten thousand cars, O Grandsire, whose limbs were made<br>of gold, and which were adorned with diverse ornaments of gold. I also<br>gave away seven thousand other cars with steeds yoked unto each. All the<br>steeds that were yoked unto them were adorned with ornaments of gold.<br>Those cars represented the Dakshinas of a sacrifice and were of exactly<br>that kind which is indicated in the Vedas. In the ten great Vajapeya<br>sacrifices that I performed, I gave away a thousand horses each endued<br>with the puissance of Indra himself, judged by their prowess and the<br>sacrifices they had performed. Spending a vast sum of money, O Grandsire,<br>and performing eight Rajasuya sacrifices, I gave away (unto the Brahmanas<br>that officiated in them) a thousand kings whose necks were adorned with<br>garlands of gold, after having vanquished them in battle. It is not,<br>however, through the merits of those acts that I have attained to this<br>region. In those sacrifices, O Lord of the universe, the presents that<br>flowed from me were as copious as the stream of Ganga herself. Unto each<br>Brahmana I gave two thousand elephants decked with gold, as many steeds<br>adorned with golden ornaments, and a hundred villages of the best kind.<br>Verily, I gave these unto each Brahmana for three times in succession.<br>Observant of penances, subsisting on regulated diet, adopting<br>tranquillity of soul, and restraining speech, I dwelt for a long time on<br>the breast of Himavat by the side of that Ganga whose irresistible<br>current (as it fell from heaven) was borne by Mahadeva on his head. It is<br>not through the merit of these acts, O Grand sire, that I have attained<br>to this region. Throwing the Sami, I adored the gods in myriads of such<br>sacrifices as are completed in course of a single day, and such others as<br>take twelve days for completing, and others still as can be completed in<br>three and ten days, besides many Pundarikas. I have not attained to this<br>region through the merits of any of those sacrifices.[456] I gave unto<br>the Brahmanas eight thousand white-complexioned bulls, each graced with a<br>beautiful hump, and each having one of its horns covered with gold. Unto<br>them I also gave beautiful wives whose necks were adorned with chains of<br>gold. I also gave away large heaps of gold and wealth of other kinds.<br>Verily, I gave away hills of gems and precious stones. Villages,<br>numbering by thousands and teeming with wealth and corn, were also given<br>away by me. With all my senses about me, I gave away unto the Brahmanas a<br>hundred thousand kine each of whom had brought forth only her first calf,<br>at many great sacrifices which I performed. It is not, however, through<br>the merits of those acts that I have attained to this region. I adored<br>the deities in a sacrifice that is completed in eleven days. Twice I<br>adored them in sacrifices that are completed in twelve days. I adored<br>them also many a time in the horse-sacrifices. Six and ten times I<br>performed the Arkayana sacrifice. It is not through the merits of those<br>acts that I have attained to this region. I also gave unto each Brahmana<br>a forest of Kanchana trees extending for a Yojana on every side, and with<br>each tree adorned with jewels and gems. It is not through the merits of<br>that act that I have attained to this region. For thirty years, with<br>heart perfectly freed from wrath, I observed the Turayana vow that is<br>possessed of very superior merit, and gave away unto the Brahmanas every<br>day nine hundred kine. Indeed, O Lord of the universe, every one of those<br>kine belonged to the Rohini species, and yielded milk at the time I gave<br>them away. It is not through the merits of those acts, O chief of the<br>deities, that I have attained to this region. I worshipped thirty fires,<br>O Brahmana, every day. I adored the deities in eight sacrifices in which<br>the fat of all animals was poured on the fire. I adored them in seven<br>sacrifices in which the fat of human beings was poured on the fire. I<br>adored them in a thousand and twenty-eight Viswajit sacrifices. It is not<br>through the merits of those sacrifices O Lord of all the deities, that I<br>have attained to this region. On the banks of Sarayu and Vahuda and Ganga<br>as also in the woods of Naimisha, I gave away millions of kine unto the<br>Brahmanas. It is not through the merits of those acts that I have<br>attained to this region. The vow of fast had been known to Indra. He had,<br>however, kept it a secret. Sukra, the descendant of Bhrigu, obtained a<br>knowledge of it by means of spiritual sight acquired through penances.<br>Blazing with energy as he does, it is Usanas who first made it known to<br>the universe. I observed that vow, O boon giving Deity! When I<br>accomplished that very superior vow, the Brahmana became all gratified<br>with me. A thousand Rishis came thither. All those Brahmanas and Rishis,<br>O puissant lord, gratified with me, said, 'Do thou repair to the region<br>of Brahmana! It is in consequence of the merits of that vow that I have<br>succeeded in attaining to this region of very superior felicity. There is<br>no doubt in this. Asked by the Supreme Ordainer of all things, I have<br>duly expounded the merits of the vow of fast. In my opinion, there is no<br>penance higher than fast. I vow to thee, O foremost of all the deities!<br>Be thou propitious unto me!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'King Bhagiratha, who had said so and who deserved<br>every honour was on the conclusion of his speech, honoured by Brahman<br>according to the rites ordained for that purpose. Do thou, therefore, O<br>Yudhishthira, observe the vow of fast and worship the Brahmanas every<br>day. The words uttered by Brahmanas can accomplish everything both here<br>and hereafter. Indeed, the Brahmanas should ever be gratified with gifts<br>of robes food and white complexioned kine and good dwelling houses and<br>mansions. The very deities should gratify the Brahmanas. Freeing thyself<br>from cupidity, do thou practise this vow of very superior merit that is<br>not known to all!'"
