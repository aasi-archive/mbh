                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell us, O king, what is that reward attached to the<br>worship of Brahmanas, seeing which thou worshippest them, O thou of<br>superior intelligence! Indeed, what is that success, flowing from their<br>worship, guided by which thou worshippest them?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited this old narrative of a<br>conversation between Pavana and Arjuna, O Bharata! Endued with a thousand<br>arms and great beauty the mighty Kartavirya, in days of yore, became the<br>lord of all the world. He had his capital in the city of Mahishmati. Of<br>unbaffled prowess, that chief of the Haihaya race of Kshatriyas swayed<br>the whole earth with her belt of seas, together with all her islands and<br>all her precious mines of gold and gems. Keeping before him the duties of<br>the Kshatriya order, as also humility and Vedic knowledge, the king made<br>large gifts of wealth unto the Rishi Dattatreya. Indeed, the son of<br>Kritavirya thus adored the great ascetic who, becoming pleased with him,<br>asked him to solicit three boons. Thus requested by the Rishi in respect<br>of boons, the king addressed him, saying, 'Let me become endued with a<br>thousand arms when I am in the midst of my troops. While, however, I<br>remain at home let me have, as usual only two arms! Indeed, let<br>combatants, when engaged in battle, behold me possessed of a thousand<br>arms, observant also of high vows, let me succeed in subjugating the<br>whole earth by dint of my prowess. Having acquired the earth righteously,<br>let me sway her with vigilance. There is a fourth boon which, O foremost<br>of regenerate persons, I solicit thee to grant. O faultless one, in<br>consequence of the disposition to favour me, it behoveth thee to grant it<br>to me. Dependent that I am on thee, whenever I may happen to go wrong,<br>let the righteous come forth to instruct and set me right! Thus<br>addressed, the Brahmana replied unto the king, saying, 'So let it be!'<br>Even thus were those boons acquired by that king of blazing effulgence.<br>Riding then on his car whose splendour resembled that of fire or the Sun,<br>the monarch, blinded by his great prowess, said, 'Who, indeed, is there<br>that can be regarded as my equal in patience and energy, in fame and<br>heroism, in prowess and strength?' After he had uttered these words, an<br>invisible voice in the welkin said, 'O ignorant wretch, dost thou not<br>know that the Brahmana is superior to the Kshatriya? The Kshatriya,<br>assisted by the Brahmana rules all creatures!'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'When gratified, I am able to create many creatures. When<br>angry, I am able to destroy all. In thought, word, and deed, I am the<br>foremost. The Brahmana is certainly not above me!' The first proposition<br>here is that the Brahmana is superior to the Kshatriya. The<br>counter-proposition is that the Kshatriya is superior. Thou hast said, O<br>invisible being that the two are united together (in the act upon which<br>the Kshatriya's superiority is sought to be based). A distinction,<br>however, is observable in this. It is seen that Brahmanas take refuge<br>with Kshatriyas. The Kshatriyas never seek the refuge of Brahmanas.<br>indeed, throughout the earth, the Brahmanas, accepting such refuge under<br>the pretence of teaching the Vedas, draw their sustenance from the<br>Kshatriyas. The duty of protecting all creatures is vested in Kshatriyas.<br>It is from the Kshatriyas that the Brahmanas derive their sustenance. How<br>then can the Brahmana be superior to the Kshatriyas? Well, I shall from<br>today, bring under my subjection, your Brahmanas who are superior to all<br>creatures but who have mendicancy for their occupation and who are so<br>self-conceited! What the virgin Gayatri has said from the welkin is not<br>true. Robed in skins, the Brahmanas move about in independence. I shall<br>bring those independent wights under my subjection. Deity or man, there<br>is none in the three worlds who can hurl me from the sovereignty I enjoy.<br>Hence, I am certainly superior to the Brahmanas. This world that is now<br>regarded as having Brahmanas for its foremost denizens shall soon be made<br>such as to have Kshatriyas for its foremost denizens. There is none that<br>is capable of bearing my might in battle! Hearing these words of Arjuna,<br>the welkin-ranging goddess became agitated. Then the god of wind,<br>addressing the king from the sky, said, 'Cast off this sinful attitude.<br>Bow unto the Brahmanas. By injuring them thou wilt bring about troubles<br>on thy kingdom. The Brahmanas will either slay thee, king though thou<br>art, or, endued with great might that they are, they will drive thee away<br>from thy kingdom, despoiling thee of thy energy!' The king, hearing this<br>speech, addressed the speaker, saying, Who, indeed, art thou?' The god of<br>wind answered, 'I am the god of wind and the messenger of the deities! I<br>say unto thee what is for thy benefit.'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'Oh, I see that thou hast today shown thy devotion and<br>attachment to the Brahmanas. Tell me now what kind of earthly creature is<br>the Brahmana! Tell me, does a superior Brahmana resemble the Wind in any<br>respect? Or, is he like Water, or Fire, or the Sun, or the Firmament?'"
