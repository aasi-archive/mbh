                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Do thou tell us, O slayer of Madhu, what the<br>prosperity is that attaches to the worship of the Brahmanas. Thou art<br>well-conversant with this topic. Verily, our grandsire knows thee.'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'Hear, O king, with rapt attention to me, O chief of<br>Bharata's race, as I recite to thee what the merits of the Brahmanas are,<br>in accordance with truth, O foremost one of Kuru's race! Once on a time<br>while I was seated at Dwaravati, O delighter of the Kurus, my son<br>Pradyumna, enraged by certain Brahmanas, came to me and said, 'O slayer<br>of Madhu, what merit attaches to the worship of the Brahmanas? Whence is<br>their lordship derived both here and hereafter? O giver of honours, what<br>rewards are won by constantly Worshipping the Brahmanas? Do thou kindly<br>explain this clearly to me, for my mind is disturbed by doubts in respect<br>of this.' When these words were addressed to me by Pradyumna, I answered<br>him as follows, Do thou hear, O king, with close attention, what those<br>words were, 'O child of Rukmin, listen to me as I tell thee what the<br>prosperity is that one may win by worshipping the Brahmanas. When one<br>sets oneself to the acquisition of the well-known aggregate of three<br>(viz., Righteousness, Wealth, and Pleasure), or to the achievement of<br>Emancipation, or to that of fame and prosperity, or to the treatment and<br>cure of disease, or to the worship of the deities and the Pitris, one<br>should take care to gratify the regenerate ones. They are each a king<br>Soma (that sheds such agreeable light in the firmament.) They are<br>dispensers of happiness and misery. O child of Rukmini, whether in this<br>or in the next world, O son, everything agreeable has its origin in the<br>Brahmanas. I have no doubt in this! From the worship of the Brahmanas<br>flow mighty achievements and fame and strength. The denizens of all the<br>worlds, and the Regents of the universe, are all worshippers of<br>Brahmanas. How then, O son, can we disregard them, filled with the idea<br>that we are lords of the earth? O mighty-armed one, do not suffer thy<br>wrath to embrace the Brahmanas as its object. In this as also in the next<br>world, Brahmanas are regarded as beings. They have direct knowledge of<br>everything in the universe. Verily, they are capable of reducing<br>everything into ashes, if angry. They are capable of creating other<br>worlds and other Regents of worlds (than those that exist). Why then<br>should not persons who are possessed of energy and correct knowledge<br>behave with obedience and respect towards them? Formerly, in my house, O<br>son, dwelt the Brahmana Durvasa whose complexion was green and tawny.<br>Clad in rags, he had a stick made of the Vilwa tree.[615] His beard was<br>long and he was exceedingly emaciated. He was taller in stature than the<br>tallest man on earth. Wandering over all the worlds, viz., that which<br>belongs to human beings and those that are for the deities and other<br>superior beings, even this was the verse which he sang constantly among<br>assemblies and in public squares. 'Who is there that would cause the<br>Brahmana Durvasa to dwell in his house, doing the duties of hospitality<br>towards him? He becomes enraged with every one if he finds even the<br>slightest transgression? Hearing this regarding my disposition, who is<br>there that will give me refuge? Indeed, he that would give me shelter as<br>a guest should not do anything to anger me!' When I saw that no one<br>ventured to give him shelter in his house. I invited him and caused him<br>to take up his residence in my abode. On certain days he would eat the<br>food sufficient for the needs of thousands of persons. On certain other<br>days he would eat very little. On some days he would go out of my house<br>and would not return. He would sometimes laugh without any ostensible<br>reason and sometimes cry as causelessly. At that time there was nobody on<br>earth that was equal to him in years. One day, entering the quarters<br>assigned to him he burnt all the beds and coverlets and all the<br>well-adorned damsels that were there for serving him. Doing this, he went<br>out. Of highly praiseworthy vows, he met me shortly after this and<br>addressing me, said, 'O Krishna, I wish to eat frumenty without delay!'<br>Having understood his mind previously, I had set my servants to prepare<br>every kind of food and drink. Indeed, many excellent viands had been kept<br>ready. As soon as I was asked, I caused hot frumenty to be brought and<br>offered to the ascetic. Having eaten some, he quickly said unto me, 'Do<br>thou, O Krishna, take some of this frumenty and smear all thy limbs with<br>it!' Without any scruple I did as directed. Indeed, with the remnant of<br>that frumenty I smeared my body and head. The ascetic at that time saw<br>thy mother of sweet face standing near. Laughing the while, he smeared<br>her body also with that frumenty. The ascetic then caused thy mother,<br>whose body was smeared over with frumenty, to be yoked unto a car without<br>any delay. Ascending that car he set out of my house. Endued with great<br>intelligence, that Brahmana blazed with effulgence like fire, and struck,<br>in my presence, my Rukmini endued with youth, as if she were an animal<br>destined to drag the cars of human beings. Beholding this, I did not feel<br>the slightest grief born of malice or the desire to injure the Rishi.<br>Indeed, having yoked Rukmini to the car, he went out, desirous of<br>proceeding along the high road of the city. Seeing that extraordinary<br>sight, some Dasarhas, filled with wrath, addressed one another and began<br>to converse in this way, 'Who else is there on earth that would draw<br>breath after having yoked Rukmini to a car! Verily, let the world be<br>filled with Brahmanas only! Let no other orders take birth here. The<br>poison of a virulent snake is exceedingly keen. Keener than poison is a<br>Brahmana. There is no physician for a person that has been bitten or<br>burnt by the virulent snake of a Brahmana, 'As the irresistible Durvasa<br>proceeded on the car, Rukmini tottered on the road and frequently fell<br>down. At this the regenerate Rishi became angry and began to urge Rukmini<br>on by striking her with the whip. At last, filled with a towering<br>passion, the Brahmana leapt down from the car, and fled towards the<br>south, running on foot, over a pathless ground. Beholding that foremost<br>of Brahmanas flying along the pathless ground, we followed him, although<br>we were smeared with frumenty, exclaiming behind him, 'Be gratified with<br>us, O holy one! Endued with great energy, the Brahmana, seeing me, said,<br>'O mighty-armed Krishna, thou hast subdued wrath by the strength of thy<br>nature? O thou of excellent vows, I have not found the slightest fault in<br>thee! O Govinda, I have been highly gratified with thee. Do thou solicit<br>the fruition of such wishes as thou pleasest! Behold duly, O son, what<br>the puissance is of myself when I become gratified with any one. As long<br>as deities and human beings will continue to entertain a liking for food,<br>so long will every one among them cherish the same liking for thee that<br>they cherish for their food! As long, again, as there will be<br>Righteousness in the several world, so long will the fame of thy<br>achievements last! Indeed, thy distinction will last so long in the three<br>worlds! O Janardana, agreeable thou shalt be to all persons! Whatever<br>articles of thine have been broken or burnt or otherwise destroyed (by<br>me), thou shalt see restored, O Janardana, to their former state or they<br>will reappear even in a better form! As long, again, O thou of unfading<br>glory, as thou wilt wish to live, so long wilt thou have no fear of death<br>assailing thee through such parts of thy body as have been smeared with<br>the frumenty I gave thee! O son, why didst thou not smear that frumenty<br>on the soles of thy feet as well? By not doing it, thou have acted in a<br>way that is not approved by me! Even these were the words that he said,<br>well-pleased with me on that occasion. After he had ceased speaking, I<br>saw that my body became endued with great beauty and splendour. Unto<br>Rukmini also, the Rishi, well-pleased with her, said, 'O beautiful lady,<br>thou shalt be the foremost one of thy sex in fame, and great glory and<br>achievements will be thine. Decrepitude or disease or loss of complexion<br>will never be thine! Every one will see thee engaged in waiting upon<br>Krishna, possessed as thou already art with a fragrant odour which is<br>always present in thee. Thou shalt become the foremost of all spouses,<br>numbering sixteen thousand, O Kesava. At last, when the time comes for<br>thy departure from the world, thou shalt attain to the inseparable<br>companionship of Krishna hereafter!' Having said these words unto thy<br>mother, the Rishi once more addressed me and uttering following words,<br>left the spot. Indeed, the Rishi Durvasa, blazing like a fire, said, 'O<br>Kesava, let thy understanding be always disposed even thus towards the<br>Brahmana!' Verily after uttering these words, that Brahmana disappeared<br>there and then before my eyes. After his disappearance I took to the<br>observance of the vow of uttering certain Mantras silently without being<br>heard by anybody. Verily, from that day I resolved to accomplish whatever<br>behests I should receive from the Brahmanas. Having adopted this vow, O<br>son, along with thy mother, both of us, with hearts filled with joy<br>re-entered our palace, Entering our house I saw that everything which the<br>Rishi had broken or burnt had reappeared and become new. Beholding those<br>new articles, which had besides become more durable, I became filled with<br>wonder. Verily, O son of Rukmini, from that day forth I have always<br>worshipped the Brahmanas in my mind! Even this, O chief of Bharata's<br>race, is what I said on that occasion regarding the greatness of those<br>Brahmanas who are the foremost of their order. Do thou also, O son of<br>Kunti, worship the highly blessed Brahmanas every day with gifts of<br>wealth and kine, O puissant one! It was in this way that I acquired the<br>prosperity I enjoy, the prosperity that is born of the grace of<br>Brahmanas. Whatever, again, Bhishma has said of me, O chief of the<br>Bharatas, is all true!'"
