                            "Janamejaya said, 'When that foremost person among the Kauravas, viz.,<br>Bhishma, was lying on a bed of arrows,&#8212;a bed that is always coveted by<br>heroes,&#8212;and when the Pandavas, were sitting around him, my great<br>grandsire Yudhishthira of much wisdom, heard these expositions of<br>mysteries with respect to the subject of duty and had all his doubts<br>solved. He heard also what the ordinance are that apply to the subjects<br>of gifts, and thus had all his doubts removed with respect to the topics<br>of righteousness and wealth. It behoveth thee, O learned Brahmana, to<br>tell me now what else did the great Pandava king do.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'When Bhishma became silent, the entire circle of<br>king (who were seated around him) became perfectly silent. Indeed, they<br>all sat motionless there, like figures painted on canvass. Then Vyasa the<br>son of Satyavati, having reflected for a moment, addressed the royal son<br>of Ganga, saying, 'O king, the Kuru chief Yudhishthira has been restored<br>to his own nature, along with all brothers and followers. With Krishna of<br>great intelligence by his side, he bends his head in reverence unto thee.<br>It behoveth thee to give him leave for returning to the city.' Thus<br>addressed by the holy Vyasa, the royal son of Santanu and Ganga dismissed<br>Yudhishthira and his counsellors. The royal son of Santanu, addressing<br>his grandson in a sweet voice, also said, 'Do thou return to the city, O<br>king! Let fever of thy heart be dispelled. Do thou adore the deities in<br>diverse sacrifices distinguished by large gifts of food and wealth, like<br>Yayati himself, O foremost of kings, endued with devotion and<br>self-restraint. Devoted to the practice of the Kshatriya order, do thou,<br>O son of Pritha, gratify the Pitris and the deities. Thou shalt then earn<br>great benefits. Indeed, let the fever of thy heart be dispelled. Do thou<br>gladden all thy subjects. Do thou assure them and establish peace among<br>all. Do thou also honour all thy well-wishers with such rewards as they<br>deserve! Let all thy friends and well-wishers live, depending on thee for<br>their means, even as birds live, depending for their means upon a<br>full-grown tree charged with fruit and standing on a sacred spot. When<br>the hour comes for my departure from this world, do thou come here, O<br>king. The time when I shall take leave of my body is that period when the<br>sun, stopping in his south-ward course, will begin to return northwards!'<br>The son of Kunti answered, 'So be it!' And saluted his grandsire with<br>reverence and then set out, with all his relatives and followers, for the<br>city called after the elephant. Placing Dhritarashtra at the head and<br>also Gandhari who was exceedingly devoted to her lord, and accompanied by<br>the Rishis and Kesava, as also by the citizens and the inhabitants of the<br>country and by his counsellors, O monarch, that foremost one of Kuru's<br>race entered the city named after the elephant.'"
