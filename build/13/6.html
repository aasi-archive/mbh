                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O learned sire that art versed in all the<br>scriptures, of Exertion and Destiny which is the most powerful?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'This ancient story of the conversation of Vasishtha and<br>Brahma, O Yudhishthira, is an illustration in point. In olden times the<br>adorable Vasishtha enquired of Brahma as to which among these two, viz.,<br>the Karma of a creature acquired in this life, or that acquired in<br>previous lives (and called Destiny), is the more potent in shaping his<br>life. Then, O king, the great god Brahma, who had sprung from the<br>primeval lotus, answered him in these exquisite and well-reasoned words,<br>full of meaning.'"<br><br>"Brahma said, 'Nothing comes into existence without seed. Without seed,<br>fruits do not grow. From seeds spring other seeds. Hence are fruits known<br>to be generated from seeds. Good or bad as the seed is that the<br>husbandman soweth in his field, good or bad are the fruits that he reaps.<br>As, unsown with seed, the soil, though tilled, becomes fruitless, so,<br>without individual Exertion, Destiny is of no avail. One's own acts are<br>like the soil, and Destiny (or the sum of one's acts in previous births)<br>is compared to the seed. From the union of the soil and the seed doth the<br>harvest grow. It is observed every day in the world that the doer reaps<br>the fruit of his good and evil deeds; that happiness results from good<br>deeds, and pain from evil ones; that acts, when done, always fructify;<br>and that, if not done, no fruit arises. A man of (good) acts acquires<br>merits with good fortune, while an idler falls away from his estate, and<br>reaps evil like the infusion of alkaline matter injected into a wound. By<br>devoted application, one acquires beauty, fortune, and riches of various<br>kinds. Everything can be secured by Exertion: but nothing can be gained<br>through Destiny alone, by a man that is wanting in personal Exertion.<br>Even so does one attain to heaven, and all the objects of enjoyment, as<br>also the fulfilment of one's heart's desires by well-directed individual<br>Exertion. Al! the luminous bodies in the firmament, all the deities, the<br>Nagas, and the Rakshasas, as also the Sun and the Moon and the Winds,<br>have attained to their high status by evolution from man's status,<br>through dint of their own action. Riches, friends, prosperity descending<br>from generation to generation, as also the graces of life, are difficult<br>of attainment by those that are wanting in Exertion. The Brahmana attains<br>to prosperity by holy living, the Kshatriya by prowess, the Vaisya by<br>manly exertion, and the Sudra by service. Riches and other objects of<br>enjoyment do not follow the stingy, nor the impotent, nor the idler. Nor<br>are these ever attained by the man that is not active or manly or devoted<br>to the exercise of religious austerities. Even he, the adorable Vishnu,<br>who created the three worlds with the Daityas and all the gods, even He<br>is engaged in austere penances in the bosom of the deep. If one's Karma<br>bore no fruit, then all actions would become fruitless, and relying on<br>Destiny men would become idlers. He who, without pursuing the human modes<br>of action, follows Destiny only, acts in vain, like unto the woman that<br>has an impotent husband. In this world the apprehension that accrues from<br>performance of good or evil actions is not so great if Destiny be<br>unfavourable as one's apprehension of the same in the other world if<br>Exertion be wanting while here.[9] Man's powers, if properly exerted,<br>only follow his Destiny, but Destiny alone is incapable of conferring any<br>good where Exertion is wanting. When it is seen that even in the<br>celestial regions, the position of the deities themselves is unstable,<br>how would the deities maintain their own position or that of others<br>without proper Karma? The deities do not always approve of the good deeds<br>of others in this world, for, apprehending their own overthrow, they try<br>to thwart the acts of others. There is a constant rivalry between the<br>deities and the Rishis, and if they all have to go through their Karma,<br>still it can never be averted that there is no such thing as Destiny, for<br>it is the latter that initiates all Karma. How does Karma originate, if<br>Destiny form the prime spring of human action? (The answer is) that by<br>this means, an accretion of many virtues is made even in the celestial<br>regions. One's own self is one's friend and one's enemy too, as also the<br>witness of one's good and evil deeds. Good and evil manifest themselves<br>through Karma. Good and evil acts do not give adequate results.<br>Righteousness is the refuge of the gods, and by righteousness is<br>everything attained. Destiny thwarts not the man that has attained to<br>virtue and righteousness.<br><br>In olden times, Yayati, falling from his high estate in heaven descended<br>on the Earth but was again restored to the celestial regions by the good<br>deeds of his virtuous grandsons. The royal sage Pururavas, celebrated as<br>the descendant of Ila, attained to heaven through the intercession of the<br>Brahmanas. Saudasa, the king of Kosala, though dignified by the<br>performance of Aswamedha and other sacrifices, obtained the status of a<br>man-eating Rakshasa, through the curse of a great Rishi. Aswatthaman and<br>Rama, though both warriors and sons of Munis, failed to attain to heaven<br>by reason of their own actions in this world. Vasu, though he performed a<br>hundred sacrifices like a second Vasava, was sent to the nethermost<br>regions, for making a single false statement. Vali, the son of Virochana,<br>righteously bound by his promise, was consigned to the regions under the<br>Earth, by the prowess of Vishnu. Was not Janamejaya, who followed the<br>foot-prints of Sakra, checked and put down by the gods for killing a<br>Brahmana woman? Was not the regenerate Rishi Vaisampayana too, who slew a<br>Brahmana in ignorance, and was polluted by the slaughter of a child, put<br>down by the gods? In olden times the royal sage Nriga became transmuted<br>into a lizard. He had made gifts of kine unto the Brahmanas at his great<br>sacrifice, but this availed him not. The royal sage Dhundhumara was<br>overwhelmed with decrepitude even while engaged in performing his<br>sacrifices, and foregoing all the merits thereof, he fell asleep at<br>Girivraja. The Pandavas too regained their lost kingdom, of which they<br>had been deprived by the powerful sons of Dhritarashtra, not through the<br>intercession of the fates, but by recourse to their own valour. Do the<br>Munis of rigid vows, and devoted to the practice of austere penances,<br>denounce their curses with the aid of any supernatural power or by the<br>exercise of their own puissance attained by individual acts? All the good<br>which is attained with difficulty in this world is possessed by the<br>wicked, is soon lost to them. Destiny does not help the man that is<br>steeped in spiritual ignorance and avarice. Even as a fire of small<br>proportions, when fanned by the wind, becomes of mighty power, so does<br>Destiny, when joined with individual Exertion, increase greatly (in<br>potentiality). As with the diminution of oil in the lamp its light is<br>extinguished so does the influence of Destiny is lost if one's acts stop.<br>Having obtained vast wealth, and women and all the enjoyments of this<br>world, the man, without action is unable to enjoy them long, but the<br>high-souled man, who is even diligent, is able to find riches buried deep<br>in the Earth and watched over by the fates. The good man who is prodigal<br>(in religious charities and sacrifices) is sought by the gods for his<br>good conduct, the celestial world being better than the world of men, but<br>the house of the miser though abounding in wealth is looked upon by the<br>gods as the house of dead. The man that does not exert himself is never<br>contented in this world nor can Destiny alter the course of a man that<br>has gone wrong. So there is no authority inherent in Destiny. As the<br>pupil follows one's own individual perception, so the Destiny follows<br>Exertion. The affairs in which one's own Exertion is put forth, there<br>only Destiny shows its hand. O best of Munis, I have thus described all<br>the merits of individual Exertion, after having always known them in<br>their true significance with the aid of my yogic insight. By the<br>influence of Destiny, and by putting forth individual Exertion, do men<br>attain to heaven. The combined aid of Destiny and Exertion, becomes<br>efficacious.'"
