                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O thou that knowest the truths of religion, I wish<br>to hear of the merits of compassion, and of the characteristics of devout<br>men. Do thou, O sire, describe them to me.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, In this connection, this ancient legend, the story of<br>Vasava and the high-minded Suka, is cited as an illustration. In the<br>territories of the king of Kasi, a fowler, having poisoned arrows with<br>him went out of his village on a hunting excursion in search of<br>antelopes. Desirous of obtaining, meat, when in a big forest in pursuit<br>of the chase, he discovered a drove of antelopes not far from him, and<br>discharged his arrow at one of them. The arrows of that folder of<br>irresistible arms, discharged for the destruction of the antelope, missed<br>its aim and pierced a mighty forest-tree. The tree, violently pierced<br>with that arrow tipped with virulent poison, withered away, shedding its<br>leaves and fruits. The tree having thus withered a parrot that had lived<br>in a hollow of its trunk all his life, did not leave his nest out of<br>affection for the lord of the forest. Motionless and without food silent<br>and sorrowful, that grateful and virtuous parrot also withered away with<br>the tree. The conqueror of Paka (Indra) was struck with wonder upon<br>finding that high-souled, and generous-hearted bird thus uninfluenced by<br>misery or happiness and possessing extraordinary resolution. Then the<br>thought arose in Sakra's mind,&#8212;How could this bird come to possess<br>humane and generous feelings which are impossible in one belonging to the<br>world of lower animals? Perchance, there is nothing wonderful in the<br>matter, for all creatures are seen to evince kindly and generous feelings<br>towards others.&#8212;Assuming then the shape of a Brahmana, Sakra descended<br>on the Earth and addressing the bird, said,&#8212;O Suka, O best of birds, the<br>grand-daughter (Suki) of Daksha has become blessed (by having thee as her<br>offspring). I ask thee, for what reason dost thou not leave this withered<br>tree?&#8212;Thus questioned, the Suka bowed unto him and thus<br>replied:&#8212;Welcome to thee O chief of the gods, I have recognised thee by<br>the merit of my austere penances&#8212;Well-done, well-done!&#8212;exclaimed the<br>thousand-eyed deity. Then the latter praised him in his mind, saying,&#8212;O,<br>how wonderful is the knowledge which he possesses.&#8212;Although the<br>destroyer of Vala knew that parrot to be of a highly virtuous character<br>and meritorious in action, he still enquired of him about the reason of<br>his affection for the tree. This tree is withered and it is without<br>leaves and fruits and is unfit to be the refuge of birds. Why dost thou<br>then cling to it? This forest, too, is vast and in this wilderness there<br>are numerous other fine trees whose hollows are covered with leaves and<br>which thou canst choose freely and to thy heart's content. O patient one<br>exercising due discrimination in thy wisdom, do thou forsake this old<br>tree that is dead and useless and shorn of all its leaves and no longer<br>capable of any good.'"<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The virtuous Suka, hearing these words of Sakra, heaved a<br>deep sigh and sorrowfully replied unto him, saying&#8212;O consort of Sachi,<br>and chief of the gods, the ordinances of the deities are always to be<br>obeyed. Do thou listen to the reason of the matter in regard to which<br>thou hast questioned me. Here, within this tree, was I born, and here in<br>this tree have I acquired all the good traits of my character, and here<br>in this tree was I protected in my infancy from the assaults of my<br>enemies. O sinless one, why art thou, in thy kindness, tampering with the<br>principle of my conduct in life? I am compassionate, and devoutly intent<br>on virtue, and steadfast in conduct. Kindliness of feeling is the great<br>test of virtue amongst the good, and this same compassionate and humane<br>feeling is the source of perennial felicity to the virtuous. All the gods<br>question thee to remove their doubts in religion, and for this reason, O<br>lord, thou hast been placed in sovereignty over them all. It behoves thee<br>not, O thousand-eyed one, to advise me now to abandon this tree for ever.<br>When it was capable of good, it supported my life. How can I forsake it<br>now?&#8212;The virtuous destroyer of Paka, pleased with these well-meant words<br>of the parrot, thus said to him:&#8212;I am gratified with thy humane and<br>compassionate disposition. Do thou ask a boon of me.&#8212;At this, the<br>compassionate parrot craved this boon of him, saying,&#8212;Let this tree<br>revive.&#8212;Knowing the great attachment of the parrot to that tree and his<br>high character, Indra, well-pleased, caused the tree to be quickly<br>sprinkled over with nectar. Then that tree became replenished and<br>attained to exquisite grandeur through the penances of the parrot, and<br>the latter too, O great king, at the close of his life, obtained the<br>companionship of Sakra by virtue of that act of compassion. Thus, O lord<br>of men, by communion and companionship with the pious, people attain all<br>the objects of their desire even as the tree die through its<br>companionship with the parrot.'"
