                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, O thou that art possessed of great<br>wisdom and conversant with all the scriptures. I desire to know those<br>excellent ordinances in consequence of which mortal creatures have to<br>travel through their rounds of rebirth. What is that conduct by following<br>which, O king, men succeed in attaining to high heaven, and what is that<br>conduct by which one sinks in Hell? When, abandoning the dead body that<br>is as inert as a piece of wood or clod of earth, people proceed to the<br>other world, what are those that follow them thither?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Yonder comes the illustrious Vrihaspati of great<br>intelligence! Do thou ask his blessed self. The subject is an eternal<br>mystery. None else is capable of explaining the matter. There is no<br>speaker like Vrihaspati.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'While the son of Pritha and the son of Ganga were<br>thus speaking with each other, there came to that spot from the firmament<br>the illustrious Vrihaspati of cleansed soul. King Yudhishthira, and all<br>others, with Dhritarashtra at their head, stood up and received<br>Vrihaspati with proper honours. Verily, the worship they offered to the<br>preceptor of the celestials was excellent. Then Dharma's royal son,<br>Yudhishthira, approaching the illustrious Vrihaspati, asked him the<br>question in proper form, desirous of knowing the truth.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O illustrious one, thou art conversant with all<br>duties and all the scriptures. Do thou tell me, what is truly the friend<br>of mortal creatures? Is the father, or mother, or son, or preceptor, or<br>kinsmen, or relatives, or those called friends, that may be said to truly<br>constitute the friend of a mortal creature? One goes to the next world,<br>leaving one's dead body that is like a piece of wood or a clod of earth.<br>Who is it that follows him thither?'<br><br>"Vrihaspati said, 'One is born alone, O king, and one dies alone; one<br>crosses alone the difficulties one meets with, and one alone encounters<br>whatever misery falls to one's lot. One has really no companion in these<br>acts. The father, the mother, the brother, the son, the preceptor,<br>kinsmen, relatives, and friends, leaving the dead body as if it were a<br>piece of wood or a clod of earth, after having mourned for only a moment,<br>all turn away from it and proceed to their own concerns. Only<br>Righteousness follows the body that is thus abandoned by them all. Hence,<br>it is plain, that Righteousness is the only friend and that Righteousness<br>only should be sought by all. One endued with righteousness would attain<br>to that high end which is constituted by heaven. If endued with<br>unrighteousness, he goes to Hell. Hence, the man of intelligence should<br>always seek to acquire religious merit through wealth won by lawful<br>means. Piety is the one only friend which creatures have in the world<br>hereafter. Let by cupidity, or stupefaction, or compassion, or fear, one<br>destitute of much knowledge is seen to do improper acts, for the sake of<br>even another, his judgment thus stupefied by cupidity.[506] Piety, wealth<br>and pleasure,&#8212;these three constitute the fruit of life. One should<br>acquire these three by means of being free from impropriety and sin.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira, said, 'I have carefully heard the words spoken by thy<br>illustrious self,&#8212;these words that are fraught with righteousness, and<br>that are highly beneficial. I wish now to know of the existence of the<br>body (after death).[507] The dead body of man becomes subtil and<br>unmanifest. It becomes invisible. How is it possible for piety to follow<br>it?'<br><br>"Vrihaspati said, 'Earth, Wind, Ether, Water, Light, Mind, Yama (the king<br>of the dead), Understanding, the Soul, as also Day and Night, all<br>together behold as witnesses the merits (and demerits) of all living<br>creatures. With these, Righteousness follows the creature (when<br>dead).[508] When the body becomes bereft of life, skin, bones, flesh, the<br>vital seed, and blood, O thou of great intelligence, leave it at the same<br>time. Endued with merit (and demerit) Jiva (after the destruction of this<br>body) attains to another. After the attainment by Jiva of that body, the<br>presiding deities of the five elements once more behold as witnesses all<br>his acts good and bad. What else dost thou wish to hear? If endued with<br>righteousness, Jiva enjoys happiness. What other topic, belonging to this<br>or the other world, shall I discourse upon?'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Thy illustrious self has explained how Righteousness<br>follows Jiva. I desire to know how the vital seed is originated.'<br><br>"Vrihaspati said, 'The food that these deities, O king, who dwell in the<br>body, viz., Earth, Wind, Ether, Water, Light, and Mind eat, gratifies<br>them. When those five elements become gratified, O monarch, with Mind<br>numbering as their sixth, their vital seed then becomes generated, O thou<br>of cleansed soul! When an act of union takes place between male and<br>female, the vital seed flows out and causes conception. I have thus<br>explained to thee what thou hast asked. What else dost thou wish to hear?'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast, O illustrious one, said how conception<br>takes place. Do thou explain how the Jiva that takes birth grows (by<br>becoming possessed of body).'<br><br>"Vrihaspati said, 'As soon as Jiva enters the vital seed, he becomes<br>overwhelmed by the elements already mentioned. When Jiva becomes<br>disunited therewith, he is said to attain to the other end (viz., death).<br>Endued as Jiva becomes with all those elements, he attains, in<br>consequence thereof, a body. The deities, that preside over those<br>elements behold as witnesses all his acts, good and bad. What else dost<br>thou wish to hear?'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Leaving off skin and bone and flesh, and becoming<br>destitute of all those elements, in what does Jiva reside, O illustrious<br>one, for enjoying and enduring happiness and misery?'<br><br>"Vrihaspati said, 'Endued with all his acts, the Jiva quickly enters the<br>vital seed, and utilizing the functional flow of women, takes birth in<br>time, O Bharata. After birth, the Jiva receives woe and death from the<br>messengers of Yama. Indeed, misery and a painful round of rebirth are his<br>inheritance. Endued with life, O king, the Jiva in this world, from the<br>moment of his birth, enjoys and endures his own (previous) acts,<br>depending upon righteousness (and its reverse). If the Jiva, according to<br>the best of his power, follows righteousness from the day of his birth,<br>he then succeeds in enjoying, when reborn, happiness without<br>interruption. If, on the other hand, without following righteousness<br>without interruption, he acts sinfully, he reaps happiness at first as<br>the reward of his righteousness and endures misery after that. Endued<br>with unrighteousness, the Jiva has to go to the dominions of Yama and<br>suffering great misery there, he has to take birth in an intermediate<br>order of being,[509] Listen to me as I tell thee what the different acts<br>are by doing which the diva, stupefied by folly, has to take birth in<br>different orders of being, as declared in the Vedas, the scriptures, and<br>the (sacred) histories. Mortals have to go to the frightful regions of<br>Yama. In those regions, O king, there are places that are fraught with<br>every merit and that are worthy on that account of being the abodes of<br>the very deities. There are, again, places in those regions that are<br>worse than those which are inhabited by animals and birds. Indeed, there<br>are spots of these kinds in the abode of Yama which (so far as its<br>happier regions are concerned) is equal to the region of Brahman himself<br>in merits. Creatures, bound by their acts, endure diverse kinds of<br>misery. I shall, after this, tell thee what those acts and dispositions<br>are in consequence of which a person obtains to an end that is fraught<br>with great misery and terror. If a regenerate person, having studied the<br>four Vedas, becomes stupefied by folly and accepts a gift from a fallen<br>man, he has then to take birth in the asinine order. He has to live as an<br>ass for five and ten years. Casting off his asinine form, he has next to<br>take birth as an ox, in which state he has to live for seven years.<br>Casting off his bovine form, he has next to take birth as a Rakshasa of<br>regenerate order. Living as Rakshasa of the regenerate order for three<br>months, he then regains his status (in his next birth) of a<br>Brahmana.[510] A Brahmana, by officiating at the sacrifice of a fallen<br>person, has to take birth as a vile worm. In this form he has to live for<br>five and ten years, O Bharata. Freed from the status of a worm, be next<br>takes birth as an ass. As an ass he has to live for five years, and then<br>a hog, in which state also he has to remain for as many years. After<br>that, he takes birth as a cock, and living for five years in that form,<br>he takes birth as a jackal and lives for as many years in that state. He<br>has next to take birth as a dog, and living thus for a year he regains<br>his status of humanity. That foolish disciple who offends his preceptor<br>by doing any injury to him, has certainly to undergo three<br>transformations in this world. Such a person, O monarch, has in the first<br>instance to become a dog. He has then to become a beast of prey, and then<br>an ass. Living his asinine form, he has to wander for some time in great<br>affliction as a spirit. After the expiration of that period, he has to<br>take birth as a Brahmana. That sinful disciple who even in thought<br>commits adultery with the wife of his preceptor, has in consequence of<br>such a sinful heart, to undergo many fierce shapes in this world. First<br>taking birth in the canine order he has to live for three years. Casting<br>off the canine form when death comes, he takes birth as a worm or vile<br>vermin. In this form he has to live for a year. Leaving that form he<br>succeeds in regaining his status as a human being of the regenerate<br>order. If the preceptor kills, without reason, his disciple who is even<br>as a son to him, he has, in consequence of such a wilful act of sin on<br>his part, to take birth as a beast of prey. That son who disregards his<br>father and mother, O king, has to take birth, after leaving off his human<br>form as an animal of the asinine order. Assuming the asinine form he has<br>to live for ten years. After that he has to take birth as a crocodile, in<br>which form he has to live for a year. After that he regains the human<br>form. That son with whom his parents become angry, has, in consequence of<br>his evil thoughts towards them, to take birth as an ass. As an ass he has<br>to live for ten months. He has then to take birth as a dog and to remain<br>as such for four and ten months. After that he has to take birth as a cat<br>and living in that form for seven months he regains his status of<br>humanity. Having spoken ill of parents, one has to take birth as a<br>Sarika. Striking them, one has to take birth, O king, as tortoise. Living<br>as a tortoise for ten years, he has next to take birth as a porcupine.<br>After that he has to take birth as a snake, and living for six months in<br>that form he regains the status of humanity. That man who, while<br>subsisting upon the food that his royal master supplies, commits acts<br>that are injurious to the interests of his master,&#8212;that man, thus<br>stupefied by folly, has after death to take birth as an ape. For ten<br>years he has to live as an ape, and after that for five years as a mouse.<br>After that he has to become a dog, and living in that form for a period<br>of six months he succeeds in regaining his status of humanity. That man<br>who misappropriates what is deposited with him in trustfulness has to<br>undergo a hundred transformations. He at last takes birth as a vile worm.<br>In that order he has to live for a period of ten and five years, O<br>Bharata. Upon the exhaustion of his great demerit in this way, he<br>succeeds in regaining his status of humanity. That man who harbours<br>malice towards others has, after death, to take birth as a Sarngaka. That<br>man of wicked understanding who becomes guilty of breach of trust has to<br>take birth as a fish. Living as a fish for eight years, he takes birth, O<br>Bharata, as a deer. Living as a deer for four months, he has next to take<br>birth as a goat. After the expiration of a full year he casts off his<br>goatish body, he takes birth then as a worm. After that he succeeds in<br>regaining his status of humanity. That shameless insensate man who,<br>through stupefaction, steals paddy, barley, sesame, Masha, Kulattha,<br>oil-seeds, oats, Kalaya, Mudga, wheat, Atasi, and other kinds of corn,<br>has to take birth as a mouse[511]. After leading the life for some time<br>he has to take birth as a hog. As soon as he takes birth as a hog he has<br>to die of disease. In consequence of his sin, that foolish man has next<br>to take birth as a dog, O king. Living as a dog for five years, he then<br>regains his status of humanity. Having committed an act of adultery with<br>the spouse of another man, one has to take birth as a wolf. After that he<br>has to assume the forms of a dog and jackal and vulture. He has next to<br>take birth as a snake and then as a Kanka and then as a crane.[512] That<br>man of sinful soul who, stupefied by folly, commits an act of sexual<br>congress with the spouse of a brother, has to take birth as a male Kokila<br>and to live in that form for a whole year, O king. He who, through lust,<br>commits an act of sexual congress with the wife of a friend, or the wife<br>of preceptor, or the wife of his king, has, after death, to take the form<br>of a hog. He has to live in his porcine form for five years and then to<br>assume that of a wolf for ten years. For the next five years he has to<br>assume that of a wolf for ten years. For the next five years he has to<br>live as a cat and then for the next ten years as a cock. He has next to<br>live for three months as an ant, and then as a worm for a month. Having<br>undergone these transformations he has next to live as a vile worm for<br>four and ten years. When his sin becomes exhausted by such chastisement,<br>he at last regains the status of humanity. When a wedding is about to<br>take place, or a sacrifice, or an act of gifts is about to be made, O<br>thou of great puissance, the man who offers any obstruction, has to take<br>birth in his next life as a vile worm, Assuming such a form he has to<br>live, O Bharata, for five and ten years. When his demerit is exhausted by<br>such suffering, he regains the status of humanity. Having once bestowed<br>his daughter in marriage upon a person, he who seeks to bestow her again<br>upon a second husband, has, O king, to take birth among vile worms.<br>Assuming such a form, O Yudhisthira, he has to live for a period of three<br>and ten years. Upon the exhaustion of his demerit by such sufferance, he<br>regains the status of humanity. He who eats without having performed the<br>rites in honour of the deities or those in honour of the Pitris or<br>without having offered (even) oblations of water to both the Rishis and<br>the Pitris, has to take birth as a crow. Living as a crow for a hundred<br>years he next assumes the form of a cock. His next transformation is that<br>of a snake for a month. After this, he regains the status of humanity. He<br>who disregards his eldest brother who is even like a sire, has, after<br>death, to take birth in the order of cranes. Having assumed that form he<br>has to live in it for two years. Casting off that form at the conclusion<br>of that period, he regains the status of humanity. That Sudra who has<br>sexual intercourse with a Brahmana woman, has, after death, to take birth<br>as a hog. As soon as he takes birth in the porcine order he dies of<br>disease, O king. The wretch has next to take birth as a dog. O king, in<br>consequence of his dire act of sin. Casting off his canine form he<br>regains upon the exhaustion of his demerit, the status of humanity. The<br>Sudra who begets offspring upon a Brahmana woman, leaving off his human<br>form, becomes reborn as a mouse. The man who becomes guilty of<br>ingratitude O king, has to go to the regions of Yama and there to undergo<br>very painful and severe treatment at the hands of the messengers,<br>provoked to fury, of the grim king of the dead. Clubs with heavy hammers<br>and mallets, sharp-pointed lances, heated jars, all fraught with severe<br>pain, frightful forests of sword-blades, heated sands, thorny<br>Salmalis&#8212;these and many other instruments of the most painful torture<br>such a man has to endure in the regions of Yama, O Bharata! The<br>ungrateful person, O chief of Bharata's race, having endured such<br>terrible treatment in the regions of the grim king of the dead, has to<br>come back to this world and take birth among vile vermin.[513] He has to<br>live as a vile vermin for a period of five and ten years. O Bharata, He<br>has then to enter the womb and die prematurely before birth. After this,<br>that person has to enter the womb a hundred times in succession. Indeed,<br>having, undergone a hundred rebirths, he at last becomes born as a<br>creature in some intermediate order between man and inanimate nature.<br>Having endured misery for a great many years, he has to take birth as a<br>hairless tortoise. A person that steals curds has to take birth as a<br>crane. One becomes a monkey by stealing raw fish. That man of<br>intelligence who steals honey has to take birth as a gadfly. By stealing<br>fruits or roots or cakes one becomes an ant. By stealing Nishpava one<br>becomes a Halagolaka.[514] By stealing Payasa one becomes in one's next<br>birth a Tittiri bird. By stealing cakes one becomes a screech-owl. That<br>man of little intelligence who steals iron has to take birth as a cow.<br>That man of little understanding who steals white brass has to take birth<br>as a bird of the Harita species. By stealing a vessel of silver one<br>becomes a pigeon. By stealing a vessel of gold one has to take birth as a<br>vile vermin. By stealing a piece of silken cloth, one becomes a Krikara.<br>By stealing a piece of cloth made of red silk, one becomes a<br>Vartaka.[515] By stealing a piece of muslin one becomes a parrot. By<br>stealing a piece of cloth that is of fine texture, one becomes a duck<br>after casting off one's human body. By stealing a piece of cloth made of<br>cotton, one becomes a crane. By stealing a piece of cloth made of jute,<br>one becomes a sheep in one's next life. By stealing a piece of linen, one<br>has to take birth as a hare. By stealing different kinds of colouring<br>matter one has to take birth as a peacock. By stealing a piece of red<br>cloth one has to take birth as a bird of the Jivajivaka species. By<br>stealing unguents (such as sandal-paste) and perfumes in this world, the<br>man possessed of cupidity, O king, has to take birth as a mole. Assuming<br>the form of a mole one has to live in it for a period of five and ten<br>years. After the exhaustion of his demerit by such sufferings he regains<br>the status of humanity. By stealing milk, one becomes a crane. That man,<br>O king, who through stupefaction of the understanding, steals oil, has to<br>take birth, after casting off this body, as an animal that subsists upon<br>oil as his form.[516] That wretch who himself well armed, slays another<br>while that other is unarmed, from motives of obtaining his victim's<br>wealth or from feelings of hostility, has, after casting off his human<br>body, to take birth as an ass. Assuming that asinine form he has to live<br>for a period of two years and then he meets with death at the edge of a<br>weapon. Casting off in this way his asinine body he has to take birth in<br>his next life as a deer always filled with anxiety (at the thought of<br>foes that may kill him). Upon the expiration of a year from the time of<br>his birth as a deer, he has to yield up his life at the point of a<br>weapon. Thus casting off his form of a deer, he next takes birth as a<br>fish and dies in consequence of being dragged up in net, on the<br>expiration of the fourth month. He has next to take birth as a beast of<br>prey. For ten years he has to live in that form, and then he takes birth<br>as a pard in which form he has to live for a period of five years.<br>Impelled by the change that is brought about by time, he then casts off<br>that form, and his demerit having been exhausted he regains the status of<br>humanity. That man of little understanding who kills a woman has to go<br>the regions of Yama and to endure diverse kinds of pain and misery. He<br>then has to pass through full one and twenty transformations. After that,<br>O monarch, he has to take birth as a vile vermin. Living as a vermin for<br>twenty years, he regains the status of humanity. By stealing food, one<br>has to take birth as a bee. Living for many months in the company of<br>other bees, his demerit becomes exhausted and he regains the status of<br>humanity. By stealing paddy, one becomes a cat. That man who steals food<br>mixed with sesame cakes has in his next birth to assume the form of a<br>mouse large or small according to the largeness or smallness of the<br>quantity stolen. He bites human beings every day and as the consequence<br>thereof becomes sinful and travels through a varied round of rebirths.<br>That man of foolish understanding who steals ghee has to take birth as a<br>gallinule. That wicked person who steals fish has to take birth as a<br>crow. By stealing salt one has to take birth as a mimicking bird. That<br>man who misappropriates what is deposited with him through confidence,<br>has to sustain a diminution in the period of his life, and after death<br>has to take birth among fishes. Having lived for some time as a fish he<br>dies and regains the human form. Regaining, however, the status of<br>humanity, he becomes short-lived. Indeed, having committed sins, O<br>Bharata, one has to take birth in an order intermediate between that of<br>humanity and vegetables. Those people are entirely unacquainted with<br>righteousness which has their own hearts for its authority. Those men<br>that commit diverse acts of sin and then seek to expiate them by<br>continuous vows and observances of piety, become endued with both<br>happiness and misery and live in great anxiety of heart.[517] Those men<br>that are of sinful conduct and that yield to the influence of cupidity<br>and stupefaction, without doubt, take birth as Mlechchhas that do not<br>deserve to be associated with. Those men on the other hand, who abstain<br>from sin all their lives, become free from disease of every kind, endued<br>with beauty of form and possessed of wealth. Women also, when they act in<br>the way indicated, attain to births of the same kind. Indeed, they have<br>to take births as the spouses of the animals I have indicated. I have<br>told thee all the faults that relate to the appropriation of what belongs<br>to others. I have discoursed to thee very briefly on the subject, O<br>sinless one. In connection with some other subject, O Bharata, thou shalt<br>again hear of those faults. I heard all this, O king, in days of old,<br>from Brahman himself, and I asked all about it in a becoming way, when he<br>discoursed on it in the midst of the celestial Rishis. I have told thee<br>truly and in detail all that thou hadst asked me. Having listened to all<br>this, O monarch, do thou always set thy heart on righteousness.'"
