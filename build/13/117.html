                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Desiring to die or desiring to live, many persons<br>give up their lives in the great sacrifice (of battle). Tell me, O<br>grandsire, what is the end that these attain to. To throw away life in<br>battle is fraught with sorrow for men. O thou of great wisdom, thou<br>knowest that to give up life is difficult for men whether they are in<br>prosperity, or adversity, in felicity or calamity. In my opinion, thou<br>art possessed of omniscience. Do thou tell me the reason of this.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In prosperity or adversity, in happiness or woe, living<br>creatures, O lord of the earth, coming into this world, live according to<br>a particular tenor. Listen to me as I explain the reason to thee. The<br>question thou hast asked me is excellent, O Yudhishthira! In this<br>connection, O king, I shall explain to thee the old narrative of the<br>discourse that took place in former times between the Island-born Rishi<br>and a crawling worm. In days of old, when that learned Brahmana, viz.,<br>the Island-born Krishna, having identified himself with Brahma, roamed<br>over the world, he beheld, on a road over which cars used to pass, a worm<br>moving speedily. The Rishi was conversant with the course of every<br>creature and the language of every animal. Possessed of omniscience, he<br>addressed the worm he saw in these words.'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'O worm, thou seemest to be exceedingly alarmed, and to be<br>in great haste. Tell me, whither dost thou run, and whence hast thou been<br>afraid.'<br><br>"The worm said, 'Hearing the rattle of yonder large car I am filled with<br>fear. O thou of great intelligence, fierce is the roar it makes. It is<br>almost come! The sound is heard. Will it not kill me? It is for this that<br>I am flying away. The sound, as it is heard from a near point, I catch,<br>of the bulls I hear. They are breathing hard under the whip of the<br>driver, as they are drawing the heavy burden. I hear also the diverse<br>sounds made by the men who are driving the bulls. Such sounds are<br>incapable of being heard by a creature that like us has taken his birth<br>in the order of worms. It is for this reason that I am flying from this<br>situation of great fright. Death is felt by all creatures to be fraught<br>with pain. Life is an acquisition difficult to make. Hence, I fly away in<br>fear, I do not wish to pass from a state of happiness to one of woe.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed, the Island-born Vyasa said, 'O worm,<br>whence can be thy happiness? Thou belongest to the inter-mediate order of<br>being. I think, death would be fraught with happiness to thee! Sound,<br>touch, taste, scent, and diverse kinds of excellent enjoyments are<br>unknown to thee, O worm! I think, death will prove a benefit to thee!'<br><br>"The worm said, 'A living creature, in whatever situation he may be<br>placed, becomes attached to it. In even this order of being I am happy, I<br>think, O thou of great wisdom! It is for this that I wish to live. In<br>even this condition, every object of enjoyment exists for me according to<br>the needs of my body. Human beings and those creatures that spring from<br>immobile objects have different enjoyments. In my former life I was a<br>human being. O puissant one, I was a Sudra possessed of great wealth. I<br>was not devoted to the Brahmanas. I was cruel, vile in conduct, and a<br>usurer. I was harsh in speech. I regard cunning as wisdom. I hated all<br>creatures. Taking advantage of pretexts in compacts made between myself<br>and others. I was always given to taking away what belonged to others.<br>Without feeding servants and guests arrived at my house, I used to fill,<br>when hungry, my own stomach, under the impulse of pride, covetous of good<br>food. Greedy I was of wealth, I never dedicated, with faith and<br>reverence, any food to the deities and the Pitris although duty required<br>me to dedicate food unto them. Those men that came to me, moved by fear,<br>for seeking my protection, I sent adrift without giving them any<br>protection. I did not extend my protection to those that came to me with<br>prayers for dispelling their fear. I used to feel unreasonable envy at<br>seeing other people's wealth, and corn, and spouses held dear by them,<br>and articles of drink, and good mansions. Beholding the happiness of<br>others, I was filled with envy and I always wished them poverty,<br>Following that course of conduct which promised to crown my own wishes<br>with fruition, I sought to destroy the virtue, wealth, and pleasures of<br>other people. In that past life of mine, I committed diverse deeds<br>largely fraught with cruelty and such other passions. Recollecting those<br>acts I am filled with repentance and grief even as one is filled with<br>grief at the loss of one's dear son. In consequence of these acts of mine<br>I do not know what the fruits are of good deeds. I, however, worshipped<br>my old mother and on one occasion worshipped a Brahmana. Endued with<br>birth and accomplishments, that Brahmana, in course of his wanderings,<br>came to my house once as a guest. I received him with reverent<br>hospitality. In consequence of the merit attaching to that act, my memory<br>has not forsaken me. I think that in consequence of that act I shall once<br>more succeed in regaining happiness. O thou of ascetic wealth, thou<br>knowest everything. Do thou in kindness tell me what is for my good."
