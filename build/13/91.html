                            "Yudhishthira said, 'By whom was the Sraddha first conceived and at what<br>time? What also is its essence? During the time when the world was<br>peopled by only the descendants of Bhrigu and Angiras; who was the muni<br>that established the Sraddha? What acts should not be done at Sraddha?<br>What are those Sraddhas in which fruits and roots are to be offered? What<br>species' also of paddy should be avoided in Sraddhas? Do thou tell me all<br>this, O grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen to me, O ruler of men, as I tell thee how the<br>Sraddha was introduced, the time of such introduction, the essences of<br>the rite, and the Muni who conceived it. From the Self-born Brahman<br>sprang Atri, O thou of Kuru's race. In Atri's race was born a Muni of the<br>name of Dattatreya. Dattatreya got a son of the name of Nimi possessed of<br>wealth of asceticism. Nimi got a son named Srimat who was endued with<br>great beauty of person. Upon the expiration of a full thousand years,<br>Srimat, having undergone the severest austerities, succumbed to the<br>influence of Time and departed from this world. His sire Nimi, having<br>performed the Purificatory rites according to the ritual laid down in the<br>ordinance, became filled with great grief, thinking continually of the<br>loss of his son.[411] Thinking of that cause of sorrow the high-souled<br>Nimi collected together various agreeable objects (of food and drink) on<br>the fourteenth day of the moon. The next morning he rose from bed. Pained<br>his heart was with grief, as he rose from sleep that day&#8212;he succeeded in<br>withdrawing it from the one object upon which it had been working. His<br>understanding succeeded in busying itself with other matters. With<br>concentrated attention he then conceived the idea of a Sraddha. All those<br>articles of his own food, consisting of fruits and roots, and all those<br>kinds of staple grains that were agreeable to him, were carefully thought<br>of by that sage possessed of wealth of penances. On the day of the New<br>moon he invited a number of adorable Brahmanas (to his asylum). Possessed<br>of great wisdom, Nimi caused them to be seated on seats (of Kusa grass)<br>and honoured them by going around their persons. Approaching seven such<br>Brahmanas whom he had brought to his abode together, the puissant Nimi<br>gave unto them food consisting of Syamaka rice, unmixed with salt.<br>Towards the feet of those Brahmanas engaged in eating the food that was<br>served unto them a number of Kusa blades was spread out on the seats they<br>occupied, with the top ends of the blades directed towards the south.<br>With a pure body and mind and with concentrated attention, Nimi, having<br>placed those blades of sacred grass in the way indicated, offered cakes<br>of rice unto his dead son, uttering his name and family. Having done<br>this, that foremost of Munis became filled with regret at the idea of<br>having achieved an act that had not (to his knowledge) been laid down in<br>any of the scriptures. Indeed, filled with regret he began to think of<br>what he had done.[412] 'Never done before by the Munis, alas, what have I<br>done! How shall I (for having done an act that has not been ordained)<br>avoid being cursed by the Brahmanas (as an introducer of strange rites)?'<br>He then thought of the original progenitor of his race. As soon as he was<br>thought of, Atri endued with wealth of penances came there. Beholding him<br>exceedingly afflicted with grief on account of the death of his son, the<br>immortal Atri comforted him with agreeable counsels. He said unto him, 'O<br>Mini, this rite that thou hast conceived, is a sacrifice in honour of the<br>Pitris. Let no fear be thine, O thou that art possessed of the wealth of<br>asceticism! The Grandsire Brahman himself, in days of old, laid it down!<br>This rite that thou hast conceived has been ordained by the Self-born<br>himself. Who else than the Self-born could ordain this ritual in<br>Sraddhas? I shall presently tell thee, O son, the excellent ordinance<br>laid down in respect of Sraddhas. Ordained by the Self-born himself, O<br>son, do thou follow it. Listen to me first! Having first performed the<br>Karana on the sacred fire with the aid of Mantras, O thou that art<br>possessed of wealth of penances, one should always pour libations next<br>unto the deity of fire, and Soma, and Varuna. Unto the Viswedevas also,<br>who are always the companions of the Pitris, the Self-born then ordained<br>a portion of the offerings. The Earth also, as the goddess that sustains<br>the offerings made at Sraddhas, should then be praised under the names of<br>Vaishnavi, Kasyapi, and the inexhaustible.[413] When water is being<br>fetched for the Sraddha, the deity Varuna of great puissance should be<br>praised. After this, both Agni and Soma should be invoked with reverence<br>and gratified (with libations), O sinless one. Those deities that are<br>called by the name of Pitris were created by the Self-born. Others also,<br>highly blessed, viz., the Ushnapsa, were created by him. For all these<br>shares have been ordained of the offerings made at Sraddhas. By adoring<br>all these deities at Sraddhas, the ancestors of the persons performing<br>them become freed from all sins. The Pitris referred to above as those<br>created by the Self-born number seven. The Viswedevas having Agni for<br>their mouth (for it is through Agni that they feed), have been mentioned<br>before. I shall now mention the names of those high-souled deities who<br>deserve shares of the offerings made at Sraddhas. Those names at Vala,<br>Dhriti, Vipapa, Punyakrit, Pavana, Parshni, Kshemak, Divysanu, Vivaswat,<br>Viryavat, Hrimat, Kirtimat, Krita, Jitatman, Munivirya, Diptaroman,<br>Bhayankara, Anukarman, Pratia, Pradatri, Ansumat, Sailabha, Parama<br>krodhi, Dhiroshni, Bhupati, Sraja, Vajrin, and Vari,&#8212;these are the<br>eternal Viswedevas. There are others also whose names are Vidyutvarchas,<br>Somavarchas, and Suryasri. Others also are numbered amongst them, viz.,<br>Somapa, Suryasavitra, Dattatman, Pundariyaka, Ushninabha, Nabhoda,<br>Viswayu, Dipti, Chamuhara, Suresa, Vyomari, Sankara Bhava, Isa, Kartri,<br>Kriti, Daksha, Bhuvana, Divya, Karmakrit, Ganita Panchavirya, Aditya,<br>Rasmimat, Saptakrit, Somavachas, Viswakrit, Kavi, Anugoptri, Sugoptri,<br>Naptri, and Iswara:&#8212;these highly blessed ones are numbered as the<br>Viswedevas. They are eternal and conversant with all that occurs in Time.<br>The species of paddy which should not be offered at Sraddhas are those<br>called Kodrava, and Pulka. Assafoetida also, among articles used in<br>cooking, should not be offered, as also onions and garlic, the produce of<br>the Moringa pterygosperma, Bauhinia Variegata, the meat of animals slain<br>with envenomed shafts all varieties of Sucuribita Pepo, Sucuribita<br>lagenaria, and black salt. The other articles that should not be offered<br>at Sraddhas are the flesh of the domesticated hog, the meat of all<br>animals not slaughtered at sacrifices, Nigella sativa, salt of the<br>variety called Vid, the potherb that is called Sitapaki, all sprouts<br>(like those of the bamboo), and also the Trapa bispinosa. All kinds of<br>salt should be excluded from the offerings made at Sraddhas, and also the<br>fruits of the Eugenia Jamblana. All articles, again, upon which any one<br>has spat or upon which tears have fallen should not be offered at<br>Sraddhas. Among offerings made to the Pitris or with the Havya and Kavya<br>offered to the deities, the potherb called Sudarsana (Menispermum<br>tomentosum, Rox) should not be included. Havi mixed with this is not<br>acceptable to Pitris. From the place where the Sraddha is being<br>performed, the Chandala and the Swapacha should be excluded, as also all<br>who wear clothes steeped in yellow, and persons affected with leprosy, or<br>one who has been excasted (for transgressions), or one who is guilty of<br>Brahmanicide, or a Brahmana of mixed descent or one who is the relative<br>of an excasted man. These all should be excluded by persons possessed of<br>wisdom from the place where a Sraddha is being performed,' Having said<br>these words in days of old unto the Rishi Nimi of his own race, the<br>illustrious Atri possessed of wealth of penances then went back to the<br>Grandsire's assembly in Heaven.'"
