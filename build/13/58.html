                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I desire, O chief of the Bharatas, to hear from thee<br>what the rewards are which are attached, O best of the Kurus, to the<br>planting of trees and the digging of tanks.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'A piece of land that is agreeable to the sight, fertile,<br>situate in the midst of delightful scenes adorned with diverse kinds of<br>metals, and inhabited by all sorts of creatures, is regarded as the<br>foremost of sports. A particular portion of such land should be selected<br>for digging a tank. I shall tell thee, in due order, about the different<br>kinds of tanks. I shall also tell thee what the merits also are that<br>attach to the digging of tanks (with the view of drawing water for the<br>benefit of all creatures). The man who causes a tank to be dug becomes<br>entitled to the respect and worship of the three worlds. A tank full of<br>water is as agreeable and beneficial as the house of a friend. It is<br>gratifying to Surya himself. It also contributes to growth to the<br>deities. It is the foremost of all things that lead to fame (with respect<br>to the person who causes it to be excavated). The wise have said that the<br>excavation of a tank contributes to the aggregate of three,<br>Righteousness, Wealth and Pleasure. A tank is said to be properly<br>excavated, if it is made on a piece of land that is inhabited by<br>respectable persons. A tank is said to be subservient to all the four<br>purposes of living creatures. Tanks, again, are regarded as constituting<br>the excellent beauty of a country. The deities and human beings and<br>Gandharvas and Pitris and Uragas and Rakshasas and even immobile<br>beings&#8212;all resort to a tank full of water as their refuge. I shall,<br>therefore, tell thee what the merits are that have been said by great<br>Rishis to be attached to tanks, and what the rewards are that are<br>attainable by persons that cause them to be excavated. The wise have said<br>that that man reaps the merit of an Agnihotra sacrifice in whose tank<br>water is held in the season of the rains. The high reward in the world<br>that is reaped by the person who makes a gift of a thousand kine is won<br>by that man in whose tank water is held in the season of autumn. The<br>person in whose tank water occurs in the cold season acquires the merit<br>of one who performs a sacrifice with plentiful gifts of gold. That person<br>in whose tanks water occurs in the season of dew, wins, the wise have<br>said, the merits of an Agnishtoma sacrifice. That man in whose well-made<br>tank water occurs in the season of spring acquires the merit of the<br>Atiratra sacrifice. That man in whose tank water occurs in the season of<br>summer acquires, the Rishis say, the merits that attach to a<br>horse-sacrifice. That man rescues all his race in whose tank kine are<br>seen to allay their thirst and from which righteous men draw their water.<br>That man in whose tank kine slake their thirst as also other animals and<br>birds, and human beings, acquires the merits of a horse-sacrifice.<br>Whatever measure of water is drunk from one's tank and whatever measure<br>is taken therefrom by others for purposes of bathing, all become stored<br>for the benefit of the excavator of the tank and he enjoys the same for<br>unending days in the next world. Water, especially in the other world, is<br>difficult to obtain, O son. A gift of drink produces eternal happiness.<br>Make gifts of sesame here. Make gifts of water. Do thou also give lamps<br>(for lighting dark places.) While alive and awake, do thou sport in<br>happiness with kinsmen. These are acts which thou shalt not be able to<br>achieve in the other world.[315] The gift of drink, O chief of men, is<br>superior to every other gift. In point of merit it is distinguished above<br>all other gifts. Therefore, do thou make gifts of water. Even thus have<br>the Rishis declared what the high merits of the excavation of tanks are I<br>shall now discourse to thee on the planting of trees. Of immobile objects<br>six classes have been spoken of. They are Vrikshas, Gulmas, Latas,<br>Vallis, Twaksaras, and Trinas of diverse kinds.[316] These are the<br>several kinds of vegetables. Listen now to the merit that attaches to<br>their planting. By planting trees one acquires fame in the world of men<br>and auspicious rewards in the world hereafter. Such a man is applauded<br>and reverenced in the world of the Pitris. Such a man's name does not<br>perish even when he becomes a citizen of the world of deities. The man<br>who plants trees rescues the ancestors and descendants of both his<br>paternal and maternal lines. Do thou, therefore, plant trees, O<br>Yudhishthira! The trees that a man plants become the planter's children.<br>There is no doubt about this. Departing from this world, such a man<br>ascends to Heaven. Verily many eternal regions of bliss become his. Trees<br>gratify the deities by their flowers; the Pitris by their fruits; and all<br>guests and strangers by the shadow they give. Kinnaras and Uragas and<br>Rakshasas and deities and Gandharvas and human beings, as also Rishis,<br>all have recourse to trees as their refuge. Trees that bear flowers and<br>fruits gratify all men. The planter of trees is rescued in the next world<br>by the trees he plants like children rescuing their own father.<br>Therefore, the man that is desirous of achieving his own good, should<br>plant trees by the side of tanks and cherish them like his own children.<br>The trees that a man plants are, according to both reason and the<br>scriptures, the children of the planter. That Brahmana who excavates a<br>tank, and he that plants trees, and he that performs sacrifices, are all<br>worshipped in heaven even as men that are devoted to truthfulness of<br>speech. Hence one should cause tanks to be excavated and trees to be<br>planted, worship the deities in diverse sacrifices, and speak the truth.'"
