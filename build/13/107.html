                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O high-souled grandsire, thou hast duly discoursed<br>to us on the subject of Sacrifices, including the merits in detail that<br>attach to them both here and hereafter. It should be remembered, however,<br>O grandsire, that Sacrifices are incapable of being performed, by people<br>that are poor, for these require a large store of diverse kinds of<br>articles. Indeed, O grandsire, the merit attaching to Sacrifices can be<br>acquired by only kings and princes. That merit is incapable of being<br>acquired by those that are destitute of wealth and divested of ability<br>and that live alone and are helpless. Do thou tell us, O grandsire, what<br>the ordinances are in respect of those acts that are fraught with merit<br>equal to what attaches to sacrifices and which, therefore, are capable of<br>being performed by persons destitute of means.'[490]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O Yudhishthira! Those ordinances that I have told<br>thee of,&#8212;those, viz., that were first promulgated by the great Rishi<br>Angiras, and that have reference to meritorious facts for their<br>soul,&#8212;are regarded as equal to Sacrifices (in respect of the fruits they<br>bring about both here and hereafter). That man who takes one meal in the<br>forenoon and one at night, without taking any food or drink during the<br>interval, and who observes this regulations for a period of six years in<br>succession, abstaining all the while from injuring any creature and<br>regularly pouring libations on his sacred fire every day, attains,<br>without doubt, to success. Such a man acquires hereafter a car of the<br>complexion of heated gold, and attains to a residence, for millions of<br>years, in the region of Prajapati, in the company of celestial damsels,<br>that ever echoes with the sound of music and dance, and blazes with the<br>effulgence of fire. He who passes three years, confining himself every<br>day to one meal and abstaining all the while from congress with any other<br>woman save his own wedded wife, attains to the merit of the Agnishtoma<br>sacrifice, Such a man is regarded as having performed a Sacrifice, with<br>plenty of gifts in gold, that is dear to Vasava himself. By practising<br>truthfulness of speech, making gifts, reverencing the Brahmanas, avoiding<br>malice, becoming forgiving and self-restrained, and conquering wrath, a<br>man attains to the highest end. Riding on a car of the complexion of<br>white clouds that is drawn by swans, he lives, for millions and million<br>of years, in the company of Apsaras. Fasting for a whole day and eating<br>only one meal on the second day, he who pours libations upon his sacred<br>fire for the period of a whole year,&#8212;verily, he who observes such a fast<br>and attends every day to his fire and rises every day from bed before<br>sunrise, attains to the merit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. Such a man<br>acquires a car drawn by swans and cranes. Surrounded by the most<br>beautiful damsels, he resides in the region of Indra. That man who eats<br>only one meal every third day, and pours libations every day on his<br>sacred fire for a period of a whole year,&#8212;indeed, he who thus attends to<br>his fire every day and wakes up from sleep every morning before the sun<br>is up, attains to the high merit of the Atiratra sacrifice. He acquires a<br>car drawn by peacocks and swans and cranes. Proceeding to the region of<br>the seven (celestial) Rishis, he takes up his residence there, surrounded<br>by Apsaras of great beauty. It is well-known that such residence lasts<br>for full three Padmas of years.[491] Fasting for three days in<br>succession, he who takes only one meal every fourth day, and pours<br>libations every day on his sacred fire, acquires the high merit of the<br>Vajapeya sacrifice. The car he ac-quires is graced by celestial damsels<br>of great beauty that have Indra for their father. He resides in the<br>region of Indra for millions and millions of years and experiences great<br>happiness by witnessing the sports of the chief of the deities. Fasting<br>for four days in succession, he who eats only one meal every fifth day,<br>and pours libations on the sacred fire every day for the period of a<br>whole year, and who lives without cupidity, telling the truth,<br>reverencing the Brahmanas, abstaining from every kind of injury, and<br>avoiding malice and sin, acquires the merit of the Vajapeya sacrifice.<br>The car he rides is made of gold and drawn by swans and endued with the<br>effulgence of many suns rising together. He acquires, a palatial mansion<br>of pure white. He lives there in great happiness for full one and fifty<br>Padmas of years.[492] Fasting for five days, he who takes food on only<br>the sixth day, and pours libations on his sacred fire every day for a<br>whole year, and who performs three ablutions in course of the day for<br>purifying himself and saying his prayers and doing his worship, and who<br>leads a life of Brahmacharya, divested of malice in his conduct, acquires<br>the merit of the Gomedha sacrifice. He acquires an excellent car adorned<br>with pure gold, possessed of the effulgence of a blazing fire and drawn<br>by swans and peacocks. He sleeps on the lap of Apsaras and is awakened<br>every morning by the melodious tinkle of Nupuras and Kanchis. He leads<br>such a life of happiness for ten thousand million years and three<br>thousand million besides and eight and ten Padmas and two Patakas.[493]<br>Such a man resides also, honoured by all, in the region of Brahma for as<br>many years as there are hairs on the bodies of hundreds of bears. Fasting<br>for six days, he who eats only one meal every seventh day and pours<br>libations on the sacred fire every day, for a full year, restraining<br>speech all the while and observing the vow of Brahmacharya, and<br>abstaining from the use of flowers and unguents and honey and meat,<br>attains to the region of the Maruts and of India. Crowned with the<br>fruition of every desire as it springs up in the mind, he is waited upon<br>and adored by celestial damsels. He acquires the merits of a sacrifice in<br>which abundance of gold is given away. Proceeding to the regions named,<br>he lives there for countless years in the greatest happiness[494]. He who<br>shows forgiveness to all and fasting for seven days eats on every eighth<br>day for a whole year, and, pouring libations every day on the sacred<br>fire, adores the deities regularly, acquires the high merits of the<br>Paundarika sacrifice. The car he rides is of a colour like that of the<br>lotus. Without doubt, such a man acquires also a large number of damsels,<br>possessed of youth and beauty, some having complexions that are dark,<br>some with complexions like that of gold, and some that are Syamas, whose<br>looks and attitudes are of the most agreeable kind. He who fasts for<br>eight days and takes only one meal on every ninth day for a whole year,<br>and pours libations on the sacred fire every day, acquires the high<br>merits of a thousand Horse-sacrifices. The car he rides in Heaven is as<br>beautiful as a lotus. He always makes his journeys on that car,<br>accompanied by the daughters of Rudra adorned with celestial garlands and<br>endued with the effulgence of the midday sun or the fires of blazing<br>flames. Attaining to the regions of Rudra, he lives there in great<br>happiness for countless years. He who fasts for nine days and takes only<br>one meal every tenth day for a whole year, and pours libations on his<br>sacred fire every day, acquires the high merit of a thousand<br>Horse-sacrifices, and attains to the companionship of Brahmanas'<br>daughters endued with beauty capable of charming the hearts of all<br>creatures. These damsels, possessed of such beauty, and some of them<br>possessed of complexion like that of the lotus and some like that of the<br>same flower of the blue variety, always keep him in joy[495]. He acquires<br>a beautiful vehicle, that moves in beautiful circles and that looks like<br>the dense cloud called Avarta, verily, it may be said to resemble also an<br>ocean-wave. That vehicle resounds with the constant tinkle of rows of<br>pearls and gems, and the melodious blare of conchs, and is adorned with<br>columns made of crystals and diamonds, as also with an altar constructed<br>of the same minerals. He makes his journeys on such a car, drawn by swans<br>and cranes and lives for millions and millions of years in great<br>happiness in heaven. He who fasts for ten days and eats only ghee on<br>every eleventh day for a whole year and pours libations on his sacred<br>fire every day, who never, in word or thought, covets the companionship<br>of other people's wives and who never utters an untruth even for the sake<br>of his mother and father, succeeds in beholding Mahadeva of great<br>puissance seated on his car. Such a person acquires the high merit of a<br>thousand Horse-sacrifices. He beholds the car of the Self-born Brahman<br>himself approach for taking him on it. He rides in it, accompanied by<br>celestial damsels possessed of great beauty, and complexion as effulgent<br>as that of pure gold. Endued with the blazing splendour of the Yoga-fire,<br>he lives for countless years in a celestial mansion in heaven, full of<br>every happiness. For those countless years he experiences the joy of<br>bending his head in reverence unto Rudra adored by deities and Danavas.<br>Such a person obtains every day the sight of the great deity. That man<br>who having fasted for eleven days eats only a little ghee on the twelfth,<br>and observes this conduct for a whole year, succeeds in obtaining the<br>merits attaching to all the sacrifices. The car he rides in is possessed<br>of the effulgence of a dozen suns. Adorned with gems and pearls and<br>corals of great value, embellished with rows of swans and snakes and of<br>peacocks and Chakravakas uttering their melodious notes, and beautified<br>with large domes, is the residence to which he attains in the region of<br>Brahman. That abode, O king, is always filled with men and women (who<br>wait upon him for service). Even this is what the highly blessed Rishi<br>Angiras, conversant with every duty, said (regarding the fruits of such a<br>fast). That man who having fasted for twelve days eats a little ghee on<br>the thirteenth, and bears himself in this way for a whole year, succeeds<br>in attaining to the merits of the divine sacrifice. Such a man obtains a<br>car of the complexion of the newly-blown lotus, adorned with pure gold<br>and heaps of jewels and gems. He proceeds to the region of the Maruts<br>that teem with celestial damsels, that are adorned with every kind of<br>celestial ornament, that are redolent with celestial perfumes, and that<br>contain every element of felicity. The number of years he resides in<br>those happy regions is countless[496]. Soothed with the sound of music<br>and the melodious voice of Gandharvas and the sounds and blare of drums<br>and Panavas, he is constantly gladdened by celestial damsels of great<br>beauty. That man who having fasted for thirteen days eats a little ghee<br>on the fourteenth day, and bears himself in this way for a full year,<br>obtains the merits of the Mahamedha sacrifice.[497] Celestial damsels of<br>indescribable beauty, and whose age cannot be guessed for they are for<br>ever young in appearance, adorned with every ornament and with armlets of<br>blazing effulgence, wait upon him with many cars and follow him in his<br>journeys. He is waked every morning from his bed by the melodious voice<br>of swans, the tinkle of Nupuras, and the highly agreeable jingle of<br>Kanchis. Verily, he resides in a superior abode, waited upon by such<br>celestial damsels, for years as countless as the sands on the shores of<br>Ganga. That man who, keeping his senses under control, fasts for a<br>fortnight and takes only one meal on the sixteenth day, and bears himself<br>in this way for a whole year, pouring libations every day on his sacred<br>fire, acquires the high merits that attach to a thousand Rajasuya<br>sacrifices. The car he rides in is possessed of great beauty and is drawn<br>by swans and peacocks. Riding in such a vehicle, that is, besides,<br>adorned with garlands of pearls and the purest gold and graced with<br>bevies of celestial damsels decked with ornaments of every kind, having<br>one column and four arches and seven altars exceedingly auspicious,<br>endued with thousands of banners and echoing with the sound of music,<br>celestial and of celestial attributes, embellished with gems and pearls<br>and corals, and possessed of the effulgence of lightning, such a man<br>lives in heaven for a thousand Yugas, having elephants and rhinoceroses<br>for dragging that vehicle of his. That man who having fasted for fifteen<br>days takes one meal on the sixteenth day and bears himself in this way<br>for one whole year, acquires the merits attaching to the Soma sacrifice.<br>Proceeding to Heaven he lives in the company of Soma's daughters.

Seated on his car he is waited upon by damsels of the<br>most beautiful features and agreeable manners, and commands all articles<br>of enjoyment. The period for which he enjoys such happiness consists of<br>countless years.[498] That man who having fasted for sixteen days eats a<br>little ghee on the seventeenth day and bears himself in this way for a<br>whole year, pouring libations every day on his sacred fire, proceeds to<br>the regions of Varuna and Indra, and Rudra and the Maruts and Usanas and<br>Brahman himself. There he is waited upon by celestial damsels and obtains<br>a sight of the celestial Rishi called Bhurbhuva and grasps the whole<br>universe in his ken. The daughters of the deity of the deities gladden<br>him there. Those damsels, of agreeable manners and adorned with every<br>ornament, are capable of assuming two and thirty forms. As long as the<br>Sun and the Moon move in firmament, so long does that man of wisdom<br>reside in those regions of felicity, subsisting upon the succulence of<br>ambrosia and nectar. That man who having fasted for seventeen days eats<br>only one meal on the eighteenth day, and bears himself in this way for a<br>whole year, succeeds in grasping the seven regions, of which the universe<br>consist, in his ken.

Possessed of every article of<br>enjoyment, and endued with great energy, he blazes with the effulgence of<br>the midday sun. Sportive damsels of the most delicate features and endued<br>with splendour of complexion, having deep bosoms, tapering thighs and<br>full and round hips, decked with celestial ornaments, gladden him with<br>their company while he rides on a delightful and excellent car possessed<br>of the effulgence of the sun and equipped with every article of<br>enjoyment, for thousands and thousands of Kalpas.

There he subsists upon the succulence of<br>ambrosia.

He shines on his car<br>attended by damsels that blaze forth with effulgence emitted by<br>themselves. Those damsels, the daughters of the celestial Rishis and the<br>Rudras, adore him with veneration. Capable of assuming diverse forms that<br>are highly delightful and highly agreeable, their speech is characterised<br>by diverse kinds of sweetness, and they are able to gladden the person<br>they wait upon in diverse kinds of ways. While performing his journeys,<br>he rides on a car that looks like the firmament itself in colour (for<br>subtlety of the material that compose it). In his rear are cars that look<br>like the moon; before him are those that resemble the clouds; on his<br>right are vehicles that are red; below him are those that are blue; and<br>above him are those that are of variegated hue. He is always adored by<br>those that wait upon him. Endued with great wisdom, he lives in the<br>region of Brahman for as many years as are measured by the drops of rain<br>that fall in course of a thousand years on that division of the earth<br>which is called Jamvudwipa. Verily, possessed of the effulgence of a<br>deity, he lives in that region of unalloyed felicity for as many years as<br>the drops of rain that fall upon the earth in the season of showers. The<br>man who, having fasted for a whole month, eats on the first day of the<br>following month, and bears himself in this way for ten years, attains to<br>the status of a great Rishi. He was not to undergo any change of form<br>while proceeding to heaven for enjoying the rewards of his acts in his<br>life. Verily, even this is the status to which one attains by restraining<br>speech, practising self-denial, subjugating wrath, sexual appetite, and<br>the desire to eat, pouring libations on the sacred fire, and regularly<br>adoring the two twilights. That man who purifies himself by the<br>observance of these and similar vows and practices, and who eats in this<br>way, becomes as stainless as ether and endued with effulgence like that<br>of the sun himself.[499] Such a man, O king, proceeding to haven in even<br>his own carnal form, enjoys all the felicity that is there like a deity<br>at his will.<br><br>'I have thus told thee, O chief of the Bharatas, what the excellent<br>ordinances are in respect of sacrifices, one after another, as dependent<br>upon the fruits of fasts.[500] Poor men, O son of Pritha (who are unable<br>to perform sacrifices) may; nevertheless, acquire the fruits thereof (by<br>the observance of fasts). Verily, by observing these fasts, even a poor<br>man may attain to the highest end, O foremost one of Bharata's race,<br>attending all the while, besides, to the worship of the deities and the<br>Brahmanas I have thus recited to thee in detail the ordinances in respect<br>of fasts. Do not harbour any doubt in respect of those men that are so<br>observant of vows, that are so heedful and pure and high-souled, that are<br>so freed from pride and contentions of every kind, that are endued with<br>such devoted understandings, and that pursue their end with such<br>steadiness and fixity of purpose without ever deviating from their path.'"
