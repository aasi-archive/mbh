                            "Bhishma said, "Thus addressed, king Arjuna remained silent. The god of<br>wind once more spoke to him, 'Listen now, O king, to the story of the<br>greatness of the Brahmana Agastya. Once on a time, the gods were<br>subjugated by the Asuras upon which they became very cheerless. The<br>sacrifices of the deities were all seized, and the Swadha of the Pitris<br>was also misappropriated. Indeed, O Chief of the Haihayas, all the<br>religious acts and observances of human beings also were suspended by the<br>Danavas. Divested of their prosperity, the deities wandered over the<br>earth as we have heard. One day, in course of their wandering they met<br>Agastya of high vows, that Brahmana, O king, who was endued with great<br>energy and splendour which was as blazing as that of the sun. Saluting<br>him duly, the deities made the usual enquiries of politeness. They then,<br>O King, said these words unto that high-souled one, 'We have been<br>defeated by the Danavas in battle and have, therefore, fallen off from<br>affluence and prosperity. Do thou, therefore, O foremost of ascetics,<br>rescue us from this situation of great fear.' Thus informed of the plight<br>to which the deities had been reduced, Agastya became highly incensed<br>(with the Danavas). Possessed of great energy, he at once blazed forth<br>like the all-consuming fire at the time of the universal dissolution.<br>With the blazing rays that then emanated from the Rishi, the Danavas<br>began to be burnt. Indeed, O king, thousands of them began to drop down<br>from the sky. Burning with the energy of Agastya, the Danavas, abandoning<br>both heaven and earth, fled towards the southern direction. At that time<br>the Danava king Vali was performing a Horse-sacrifice in the nether<br>regions. Those great Asuras who were with him in those regions or who<br>were dwelling in the bowels of the earth, were not burnt. The deities,<br>upon the destruction of their foes, then regained their own regions,<br>their fears entirely dispelled. Encouraged by what he accomplished for<br>them, they then solicited the Rishi to destroy those Asuras who had taken<br>refuge within the bowels of the earth or in the nether regions. Thus<br>solicited by the gods, Agastya replied unto them, saying, 'Yes, I am<br>fully competent to consume those Asuras that are dwelling underneath the<br>earth; but if I achieve such a feat, my penances will suffer a<br>diminution. Hence, I shall not exert my power.' Even thus, O king, were<br>the Danavas consumed by the illustrious Rishi with his own energy. Even<br>thus did Agastya of cleansed soul, O monarch, accomplish that feat with<br>the aid of his penances. O sinless one, even so was Agastya as described<br>by me! Shall I continue? Or, will you say anything in reply? Is there any<br>Kshatriya who is greater than Agastya?'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed, king Arjuna remained silent. The god<br>of wind once more said, 'Hear, O king, one of the great feats of the<br>illustrious Vasishtha. Once on a time the deities were engaged in<br>performing a sacrifice on the shores of the lake Vaikhanasa. Knowing of<br>his puissance, the sacrificing gods thought of Vasishtha and made him<br>their priest in imagination. Meanwhile, seeing the gods reduced and<br>emaciated in consequence of the Diksha they were undergoing, a race of<br>Danavas, of the name of Khalins, of statures as gigantic as mountains,<br>desired to slay them. Those amongst the Danavas that were either disabled<br>or slain in the fight were plunged into the waters of the Manasa lake and<br>in consequence of the boon of the Grandsire they instantly came back to<br>vigour and life. Taking up huge and terrible mountain summits and maces<br>and trees, they agitated the waters of the lake, causing them to swell up<br>to the height of a hundred yojanas. They then ran against the deities<br>numbering ten thousand. Afflicted by the Danavas, the gods then sought<br>the protection of their chief, Vasava-Sakra, however, was soon afflicted<br>by them. In his distress he sought the protection of Vasishtha. At this,<br>the holy Rishi Vasishtha assured the deities, dispelling their fears.<br>Understanding that the gods had become exceedingly cheerless, the ascetic<br>did this through compassion. He put forth his energy and burnt, without<br>any exertion, those Danavas called Khalins. Possessed of wealth of<br>penances, the Rishi brought the River Ganga, who had gone to Kailasa, to<br>that spot. Indeed, Ganga appeared, piercing through the waters of the<br>lake. The lake was penetrated by that river. And as that celestial<br>stream, piercing through the waters of the lake, appeared, it flowed on,<br>under the name of Sarayu. The place whereon those Danavas fell came to be<br>called after them. Even thus were the denizens of Heaven, with Indra at<br>their head, rescued from great distress by Vasishtha, It was thus that<br>those Danavas, who had received boons from Brahman, were slain by that<br>high-souled Rishi. O sinless one, I have narrated to thee the feat which<br>Vasishtha accomplished. Shall I go on? Or, will you say anything! Was<br>there a Kshatriya who could be said to surpass the Brahmana Vasishtha?'
