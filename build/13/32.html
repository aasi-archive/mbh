                            "Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'O grandsire, O thou of great wisdom, O thou that<br>art conversant with all branches of knowledge, I desire to hear thee<br>discourse on topics connected with duty and Righteousness. Tell me truly,<br>O chief of Bharata's race, what the merits are of those persons that<br>grant protection to living creatures of the four orders when these pray<br>for protection.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O Dharma's son of great wisdom and widespread fame,<br>listen to this old history touching the great merit of granting<br>protection to others when protection is humbly sought. Once on a time, a<br>beautiful pigeon, pursued by a hawk, dropped down from the skies and<br>sought the protection of the highly-blessed king Vrishadarbha. The<br>pure-souled monarch, beholding the pigeon take refuge in his lap from<br>fear, comforted him, saying, Be comforted, O bird; do not fear, Whence<br>hast thou taken such great fright? What hast thou done and where hast<br>thou done it in consequence of which thou hast lost thy senses in fear<br>and art more dead than alive? Thy colour, beautiful bird, is such as to<br>resemble that which adorns a fresh-blown lotus of the blue variety. Thy<br>eyes are of the hue of the pomegranate or the Asoka flower. Do not fear.<br>I bid thee, be comforted. When thou hast sought refuge with me, know that<br>no one will have the courage to even think of seizing thee,&#8212;thee that<br>hast such a protector to take care of thy person. I shall for thy sake,<br>give up today the very kingdom of the Kasi and, if need be, my lice too.<br>Be comforted, therefore, and let no fear be thine, O pigeon.'<br><br>"The hawk said, 'This bird has been ordained to be my food. It behoves<br>thee not, O king, to protect him from me. I have outcoursed this bird and<br>have got him. Verily, with great effort have I got at him at last. His<br>flesh and blood and marrow and fat will be of great good to me. This bird<br>will be the means of gratifying me greatly. Do not, O king, place thyself<br>between him and me in this way. Fierce is the thirst that is afflicting<br>me, and hunger is gnawing my bowels. Release the bird and cast him off. I<br>am unable to bear the pains of hunger any longer. I pursued him as my<br>prey. Behold, his body is bruised and torn by me with my wings and<br>talons. Look, his breath has become very weak. It behoves thee not, O<br>king, to protect him from me. In the exercise of that power which<br>properly belongs to thee, thou art, indeed competent to interfere in<br>protecting human beings when they are sought to be destroyed by human<br>beings. Thou canst not, however, be admitted to have any power over a<br>sky-ranging bird afflicted with thirst. Thy power may extend over thy<br>enemies, thy servants, thy relatives, the disputes that take place<br>between thy subjects. Indeed, it may extend over every part of thy<br>dominions and over also thy own senses. Thy power, however, does not<br>extend over the welkin. Displaying thy prowess over such foes as act<br>against thy wishes, thou mayst establish thy rule over them. Thy rule,<br>however, does not extend over the birds that range the sky. Indeed, if<br>thou hast been desirous of earning merit (by protecting this pigeon), it<br>is thy duty to look at me also (and do what is proper for enabling me to<br>appease my hunger and save my life)!<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Hearing these words of the hawk, the royal sage<br>became filled with wonder. Without disregarding these words of his, the<br>king, desirous of attending to his comforts, replied unto him saying the<br>following words.'<br><br>"The king said, 'Let a bovine bull or boar or deer or buffalo be dressed<br>today for thy sake. Do thou appease thy hunger on such food today. Never<br>to desert one that has sought my protection in my firm vow. Behold, O<br>bird, this bird does not leave my lap!'<br><br>"The hawk said, 'I do not, O monarch, eat the flesh of the boar or the ox<br>or of any of the diverse kinds of fowl. What need have I of food of this<br>or that kind? My concern is with that food which has been eternally<br>ordained for beings of my order? Hawks feed on pigeons,&#8212;this is the<br>eternal ordinance. O sinless, Usinara, if thou feelest such affection for<br>this pigeon, do thou then give me flesh from thy own body, of weight<br>equal to that of this pigeon.'<br><br>"The king said, 'Great is the favour thou showiest me today by speaking<br>to me in this strain. Yes, I shall do what thou biddest. Having said<br>this, that best of monarchs began to cut off his own flesh and weigh it<br>in a balance against the pigeon. Meanwhile, in the inner apartments of<br>the palace, the spouses of king, adorned with jewels and gems, hearing<br>what was taking place, uttered exclamations of woe and came out, stricken<br>with grief. In consequence of those cries of the ladies, as also of the<br>ministers and servants, a noise deep as the roar of the clouds arose in<br>the palace. The sky that had been very clear became enveloped with thick<br>clouds on every side. The Earth began to tremble, as the consequence of<br>that act of truth which the monarch did. The king began to cut off the<br>flesh from his flanks from the arms, and from his thighs, and quickly<br>fill one of the scales for weighing it against the pigeon. In spite of<br>all that, the pigeon continued to weigh heavier. When at last the king<br>became a skeleton of bones, without any flesh, and covered with blood, he<br>desired to give up his whole body and, therefore, ascended the scale in<br>which he had placed the flesh that he had previously cut off. At that<br>time, the three worlds, with Indra at their head, came to that spot for<br>beholding him. Celestial kettle-drums and diverse drums were struck and<br>played upon by invisible beings belonging to the firmament. King<br>Vrishadarbha was bathed in a shower of nectar that was poured upon him.<br>Garlands of celestial flowers, of delicious fragrance and touch, were<br>also showered upon him copiously and repeatedly. The deities and<br>Gandharvas and Apsaras in large bands began to sing and dance around him<br>even as they sing and dance around the Grandsire Brahma. The king then<br>ascended a celestial car that surpassed (in grandeur and beauty) a<br>mansion made entirely of gold, that had arches made of gold and gems, and<br>that was adorned with columns made of lapis lazuli. Through the merit of<br>his act, the royal sage Sivi proceeded to eternal Heaven. Do thou also, O<br>Yudhishthira, act in the same way towards those that seek thy protection.<br>He who protects those that are devoted to him, those that are attached to<br>him from love and affection, and those that depend upon him, and who has<br>compassion for all creatures, succeeds in attaining to great felicity<br>hereafter. That king who is of righteous behaviour and who is observant<br>of honesty and integrity, succeeds by his acts of sincerity in acquiring<br>every valuable reward. The royal sage Sivi of pure soul and endued with<br>great wisdom and unbaffled prowess, that ruler of the kingdom of Kasi,<br>became celebrated over the three worlds for his deeds of righteousness.<br>Anybody who would protect in the same way a seeker for protection, would<br>certainly attain (like Sivi himself) to the same happy end, O best of the<br>Bharatas. He who recites this history of the royal sage Vrishadarbha is<br>sure to become cleansed of every sin, and the person who hears this<br>history recited by another is sure to attain to the same result.'"
