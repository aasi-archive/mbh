                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, O thou of great wisdom, O thou that art<br>conversant with all branches of knowledge, what is that subject of silent<br>recitation by reciting which every day one may acquire the merit of<br>righteousness in a large measure? What is that Mantra for recitation<br>which bestows success if recited on the occasion of setting out on a<br>journey or in entering a new building, or at the commencement of any<br>undertaking, or on the occasion of sacrifices in honour of the deities or<br>of the Pitris? It behoveth thee to tell me what indeed, what Mantra it<br>is, which propitiates all malevolent influences, or leads to prosperity<br>or growth, or protection from evil, or the destruction of foes, or the<br>dispelling of fears, and which, at the same time, is consistent with the<br>Vedas.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Hear, O king, with concentrated, attention, what that<br>Mantra is which was declared by Vyasa. It was ordained by Savitri and is<br>possessed of great excellence. It is capable of cleansing a person<br>immediately of all his sins. Hear, O sinless one, as I recite to thee the<br>ordinances in respect of that Mantra. Indeed, O chief of the sons of<br>Pandu, by listening to those ordinances, one becomes cleansed of all<br>one's sins. One who recites this Mantra day and night becomes never<br>stained by sin. I shall now declare it to thee what that Mantra is. Do<br>thou listen with concentrated attention. Indeed, the man that hears it<br>becomes endued with long life, O prince, and attaining to the fruition of<br>all his wishes, sports in felicity both here and hereafter. This Mantra,<br>O king, was daily recited by the foremost of royal sages devoted to the<br>practice to Kshatriya duties and steadily observant of the vow of truth.<br>Indeed, O tiger among kings, those monarchs who, with restrained senses<br>and tranquil soul, recite this Mantra every day, succeed in acquiring<br>unrivalled prosperity&#8212;Salutations to Vasishtha of high vows after having<br>bowed with reverence unto Parasara, that Ocean of the Vedas! Salutations<br>to the great snake Ananta, and salutations to all those who are crowned<br>with success, and who are of unfading glory! Salutations to the Rishis,<br>and unto Him that is the Highest of the High, the god of gods, and the<br>giver of boons unto all those that are foremost. Salutations unto Him of<br>a thousand heads, Him that is most auspicious, Him that has a thousand<br>names, viz., Janardana! Aja. Ekapada, Ahivradhna, the unvanquished<br>Pinakin, Rita Pitrirupa, the three-eyed Maheswara, Vrishakapi, Sambhu,<br>Havana, and Iswara&#8212;these are the celebrated Rudras, eleven in number,<br>who are the lords of all the worlds. Even these eleven high-souled ones<br>have been mentioned as a hundred in the Satarudra (of the Vedas). Ansa,<br>Bhaga, Mitra, Varuna the lord of waters, Dhatri, Aryaman, Jayanta,<br>Bhaskara, Tvashtri, Pushan, Indra and Vishnu, are said to comprise a tale<br>of twelve. These twelve are called Adityas and they are the sons of<br>Kasyapa as the Sruti declares. Dhara, Dhruva, Some, Savitra. Anila,<br>Anala, Pratyusha, and Prabhava, are the eight Vasus named in the<br>scriptures, Nasataya and Dasra are said to be the two Aswins. They are<br>the sons of Martanda born of his spouse Samjna, from whose nostrils they<br>came out. After this I shall recite the names of those who are the<br>witnesses of all acts in the worlds. They take note of all sacrifices, of<br>all gifts, of all good acts. Those lords among the deities behold<br>everything although they are invisible. Indeed, they behold all the good<br>and bad acts of all beings. They are Mrityu, Kala, the Viswedevas, the<br>Pitris endued with forms, the great Rishis possessed of wealth of<br>penances, the Munis, and others crowned with success and devoted to<br>penances and emancipation. These of sweet smiles, bestow diverse benefits<br>upon those men that recite their names. Verily, endued with celestial<br>energy, they bestow diverse regions of felicity created by the Grandsire<br>upon such men. They reside in all the worlds and attentively note all<br>acts. By reciting the names of those lords of all living creatures, one<br>always becomes endued with righteousness and wealth and enjoyments in<br>copious measure. One acquires hereafter diverse regions of auspiciousness<br>and felicity created by the Lord of the universe. These three and thirty<br>deities, who are the lords of all beings as also Nandiswara of huge body,<br>and that pre-eminent one who has the bull for the device on his banner,<br>and those masters of all the worlds, viz., the followers and associates<br>of him called Ganeswara, and those called Saumyas, and called the Rudras,<br>and those called the Yogas, and those that are known as the Bhutas, and<br>the luminaries in the firmament, the Rivers, the sky, the prince of birds<br>(viz., Garuda), all those persons on earth who have become crowned with<br>success in consequence of their penances and who are existing in an<br>immobile or mobile form, the Himavat, all the mountains, the four Oceans,<br>the followers and associates of Bhava who are possessed of prowess equal<br>to that of Bhava himself, the illustrious and ever-victorious Vishnu, and<br>Skanda, and Ambika,&#8212;these are the great souls by reciting whose name<br>with restrained senses, one becomes cleansed of all sins. After this I<br>shall recite the names of those foremost Rishis who are known as Manavas.<br>They are Yavakrita, and Raibhya, and Arvavasu, and Paravasu, and Aushija,<br>and Kakshivat, and Vala the son of Angiras. Then comes Kanwa the son of<br>the Rishi Medhatithi, and Varishada. All these are endued with the energy<br>of Brahma and have been spoken of (in the scriptures) as creators of the<br>universe. They have sprung from Rudra and Anala and the Vasus. By<br>reciting their names people obtain great benefits. Indeed, by doing good<br>deeds on earth, people sport in joy in heaven, with the deities. These<br>Rishis are the priests of Indra. They live in the east. That man who,<br>with rapt attention, recites the names of these Rishis, succeeds in<br>ascending to the regions of Indra and obtaining great honours there.<br>Unmachu, Pramchu, Swastyatreya of great energy, Dridhavya, Urdhvavahu,<br>Trinasoma, Angiras, and Agastya of great energy, the son of<br>Mitravaruna,&#8212;these seven are the Ritwiks of Yama the king of the dead,<br>and dwell in the southern quarter. Dridheyu and Riteyu, and Pariyadha of<br>great fame, and Ekata, and Dwita, and Trita&#8212;the last three endued with<br>splendour like that of the sun,&#8212;and Atri's son of righteous soul, viz.,<br>the Rishi Saraswata,&#8212;these seven who had acted as Ritwiks in the great<br>sacrifice of Varuna&#8212;have taken up their abodes in the western quarter.<br>Atri, the illustrious Vasishtha, the great Rishi Kasyapa, Gotama,<br>Bharadwaja, Viswamitra, the son of Kusika, and Richika's fierce son<br>Jamadagni of great energy,&#8212;these seven are the Ritwiks of the Lord of<br>treasures and dwell in the northern quarter. There are seven other Rishis<br>that live in all directions without being confined to any particular one.<br>They, it is, who are the inducers of fame and of all this beneficial to<br>men, and they have been sung as the creators of the worlds. Dharma, Kama,<br>Kala, Vasu, Vasuki, Ananta, and Kapila,&#8212;these seven are the upholders of<br>the world. Rama, Vyasa, Drona's son Aswatthaman, are the other Rishis<br>(that are regarded as the foremost). These are the great Rishis as<br>distributed into seven groups, each group consisting of seven. They are<br>the creators of that peace and good that men enjoy. They are said to be<br>the Regents of the several points of the compass. One should turn one's<br>face to that direction in which one of these Rishis live if one wishes to<br>worship him. Those Rishis are the creators of all creatures and have been<br>regarded as the cleansers of all. Samvarta, Merusavarna, the righteous<br>Markandeya, and Sankhya and Yoga, and Narada and the great Rishi<br>Durvasa,&#8212;these are endued with severe penance and great self-restraint,<br>and are celebrated over the three worlds. There are others who are equal<br>to Rudra himself. They live in the region of Brahman. By naming them with<br>reverence a sonless man obtains a son, and a pool man obtains wealth.<br>Indeed, by naming them, one acquires success in religion, and wealth and<br>pleasure. One should also take the name of that celebrated king who was<br>Emperor of all the earth and equal to a Prajapati, viz., that foremost of<br>monarchs, Prithu, the son of Vena. The earth became his daughter (from<br>love and affection). One should also name Pururavas of the Solar race and<br>equal unto Mahendra himself in prowess. He was the son of Ila and<br>celebrated over the three worlds. One should, indeed, take the name of<br>that dear son of Vudha. One should also take the name of Bharata, that<br>hero celebrated over the three worlds. He also who in the Krita age<br>adored the gods in a grand Gomedha sacrifice, viz., Rantideva of great<br>splendour, who was equal unto Mahadeva himself, should be named. Endued<br>with penances, possessed of every auspicious mark, the source of every<br>kind of benefit to the world, he was the conqueror of the universes. One<br>should also take the name of the royal sage Sweta of illustrious fame. He<br>had gratified the great Mahadeva and it was for his sake that Andhaka was<br>slain. One should also take the name of the royal sage Bhagiratha of<br>great fame, who, through the grace of Mahadeva, succeeded in bringing<br>down the sacred river from heaven (for flowing over the earth and<br>cleansing all human beings of their sins). It was Bhagiratha who caused<br>the ashes of the sixty thousand sons of Sagara to be overflowed with the<br>sacred waters of Ganga and thereby rescued them from their sin. Indeed,<br>one should take the names of all these that were endued with the blazing<br>effulgence of fire, great beauty of person, and high energy. Some of them<br>were of awe-inspiring forms and great might. Verily, one should take the<br>names of these deities and Rishis and kings, those lords of the<br>universe,&#8212;who are enhancers of fame. Sankhya, and Yoga which is highest<br>of the high, and Havya and Kavya and that refuge of all the Srutis, viz.,<br>Supreme Brahma, have been declared to be the sources of great benefit to<br>all creatures. These are sacred and sin-cleansing and have been spoken of<br>very highly. These are the foremost of medicines for allaying all<br>diseases, and are the inducers of the success in respect of all deeds.<br>Restraining one's senses, one should, O Bharata, take the names of these,<br>morning and evening. It is these that protect. It is these that shower<br>rain. It is these that shine and give light and heat. It is these that<br>blow. It is these that create all things. These are regarded as the<br>foremost of all, as the leaders of the universe, as highly clever in the<br>accomplishment of all things, as endued with forgiveness, as complete<br>masters of the senses. Indeed, it has been said that they dispel all the<br>evils to which human beings are subject. These high-souled ones are the<br>witnesses of all good and bad deeds. Rising up in the morning one should<br>take their names, for by this, one is sure to acquire all that is good.<br>He who takes the names of them becomes freed from the fear of fires and<br>of thieves. Such a man never finds his way obstructed by any impediment.<br>By taking the names of these high-souled ones, one becomes free from bad<br>dreams of every kind. Cleared from every sin, such men take birth in<br>auspicious families. That regenerate person who, with restrained senses,<br>recites these names on the occasions of performing the initiatory rites<br>of sacrifices and other religious observances, becomes, as the<br>consequence thereof, endued with righteousness, devoted to the study of<br>the soul, possessed of forgiveness and self-restraint, and free from<br>malice. If a man that is afflicted with disease recites them, he becomes<br>freed from his sin in the form of disease. By reciting them within a<br>house, all evils are dispelled from the inmates. By reciting them within<br>a field, the growth is helped of all kinds of crops. Reciting them at the<br>time of setting out on a journey, or while one is away from one's home,<br>one meets with good fortune. These names lead to the protection of one's<br>own self, of one's children and spouses, of one's wealth, and of one's<br>seeds, and plants. The Kshatriya who recites these names at the time of<br>joining a battle sees destruction overtake his foes and good fortune<br>crown him and his party. The man who recites these names on the occasions<br>of performing the rites in honour of the deities or the Pitris, helps the<br>Pitris and deities eat the sacrificial Havya and Kavya. The man that<br>recites them becomes freed from fear of diseases and beasts of prey, of<br>elephants and thieves. His load of anxiety becomes lightened, and he<br>becomes freed from every sin. By reciting these excellent Savitri Mantras<br>on board a vessel, or in a vehicle, or in the courts of kings, one<br>attains to high success. There where these Mantras are recited, fire does<br>not burn wood. There children do not die, nor snakes dwell. Indeed, at<br>such places, there can be no fear of the king, nor of Pisachas and<br>Rakshasas.[607] Verily, the man who recites these Mantras ceases to have<br>any fear of fire or water or wind or beasts of prey. These Savitri<br>Mantras, recited duly, contribute to the peace and well-being of all the<br>four orders. Those men who recite them with reverence become freed from<br>every sorrow and at last attain to a high end. Even these are the results<br>achieved by them that recite these Savitri Mantras which are of the form<br>of Brahma. That man who recites these Mantras in the midst of kine sees<br>his kine become fruitful. Whether when setting out on a journey, or<br>entering a house on coming back, one should recite these Mantras on every<br>occasion. These Mantras constitute a great mystery of the Rishis and are<br>the very highest of those which they silently recite. Even such are these<br>Mantras unto them who practise the duty of recitation and pour libations<br>on the sacrificial fire. This that I have said unto thee is the excellent<br>opinion of Parasara. It was recited in former days unto Sakra himself.<br>Representing as it does Truth or Eternal Brahman. I have declared it in<br>full to thee. It constitutes that heart of all creatures, and is the<br>highest Sruti. All the princes of the race of Soma and of Surya, viz.,<br>the Raghavas and the Kauravas, recite these Mantras every day after<br>having purified themselves, These constitute the highest end of human<br>creatures. There is rescue from every trouble and calamity in the daily<br>recitation of the names of the deities of the seven Rishis, and of<br>Dhruva. Indeed, such recitation speedily frees one from distress. The<br>sages of olden times, viz., Kasyapa, Gotama, and others, and Bhrigu<br>Angiras and Atri and others, and Sukra, Agastya, and Vrihaspati, and<br>others, all of whom are regenerate Rishis, have adored these Mantras.<br>Approved of by the son of Bharadwaja, these Mantras were attained by the<br>sons of Richika. Verily, having acquired them again from Vasishtha, Sakra<br>and the Vasus went forth to battle and succeeded in subjugating the<br>Danavas. That man who makes a present of a hundred kine with their horns<br>covered with plates of gold unto a Brahmana possessed of much learning<br>and well-conversant with the Vedas, and he who causes the excellent<br>Bharata story to be recited in his house every day, are said to acquire<br>equal merits. By reciting the name of Bhrigu one's righteousness becomes<br>enhanced. By bowing to Vasishtha one's energy become enhanced. By bowing<br>unto Raghu, one becomes victorious in battle. By reciting the praises of<br>the Aswins, one becomes freed from diseases. I have thus, O king, told<br>thee of the Savitri Mantras which are identical with eternal Brahman. If<br>thou wishest to question me on any other topic thou mayst do so. I shall,<br>O Bharata, answer thee.'"
