                            "Bhishma said, 'Having cast off the status of a worm and taken birth as a<br>Kshatriya of great energy, the person (of whom I am speaking),<br>remembering his previous transformations, O monarch, began to undergo<br>severe austerities. Beholding those severe austerities of the Kshatriya<br>who was well-conversant with religion and wealth, the Island-born<br>Krishna, that foremost of Brahmanas, went to him.'<br><br>"Vyasa said, The penances that appertain, O worm, to the Kshatriya order<br>consist of the protection of all creatures. Do thou regard these duties<br>of the Kshatriya order to be the penances laid down for thee. Thou shalt<br>then attain to the status of a Brahmana. Ascertaining what is right and<br>what is wrong, and cleansing thy soul, do thou duly cherish and protect<br>all creatures, judiciously gratifying all good desires and correcting all<br>that is unholy. Be thou of cleansed soul, be thou contented and be thou<br>devoted to the practice of righteousness. Conducting thyself in this way,<br>thou wilt then, when thou castest off thy life-breaths, become a<br>Brahmana!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Although he had retired into the woods, yet, O<br>Yudhishthira, having heard the words of the great Rishi he began to<br>cherish and protect his subjects righteously. Soon, O best of kings, that<br>worm, in consequence of the due discharge of the duty of protecting his<br>subjects, became a Brahmana after casting off his Kshatriya body.<br>Beholding him transformed into a Brahmana, the celebrated Rishi, viz.,<br>the Island-born Krishna of great wisdom, came to him.'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'O chief of Brahmanas, O blessed one, be not troubled<br>(through fear of death)! He who acts righteously attains to respectable<br>birth. He, on the other hand, who acts unrighteously attains to a low and<br>vile birth, O thou that art conversant with righteousness, one attains to<br>misery agreeably the measure of one's sin. Therefore, O worm, do not be<br>troubled through fear of death. The only fear thou shouldst entertain is<br>about the loss of righteousness. Do thou, therefore, go on practising<br>righteousness.'<br><br>"The worm said, 'Through thy grace, O holy one, I have attained from<br>happy to happier positions! Having obtained such prosperity as has its<br>roots in righteousness, I think, my demerits have been lost.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The worm having, at the command of the holy Rishi,<br>attained to the status of a Brahmana that is so difficult to attain,<br>caused the earth to be marked with a thousand sacrificial stakes. That<br>foremost of all persons conversant with Brahma then obtained a residence<br>in the region of Brahman himself. Indeed, O son of Pritha, the worm<br>attained to the highest status, viz., that of eternal Brahma, as the<br>result of his own acts done in obedience to the counsels of Vyasa. Those<br>bulls among Kshatriyas, also, who have cast off their life-breaths (on<br>the field of Kurukshetra) exerting their energy the while, have all<br>attained to a meritorious end. Therefore O king, do not mourn on their<br>account.'"
