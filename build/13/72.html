                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast, O grandsire, discoursed to me the topic<br>of gifts of kine in speaking of the Rishi Nachiketa Thou hast also<br>impliedly discoursed, O puissant one, on the efficacy and pre-eminence of<br>that act. Thou hast also told me, O grandsire of great intelligence, of<br>the exceedingly afflicting character of the calamity that overtook the<br>high-souled king Nriga in consequence of a single fault of his. He had to<br>dwell for a tong time at Dwaravati (in the form of a mighty lizard) and<br>how Krishna became the cause of his rescue from that miserable plight. I<br>have, however, one doubt. It is on the subject of the regions of kine. I<br>desire to hear, in detail, about those regions which are reserved for the<br>residence of persons that make gifts of kine.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is recited the old narrative of the<br>discourse between Him who sprang from the primeval lotus and him who<br>performed a hundred sacrifices.'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'I see, O Grandsire, that those who are residents of the<br>region of kine transcend by their resplendence the prosperity of the<br>denizens of heaven and pass them by (as beings of an inferior station).<br>This has raised a doubt in my mind. Of what kind, O holy one, are the<br>regions of kine? Tell me all about them, O sinless one! Verily, what is<br>the nature of those regions that are inhabited by givers of kine? I wish<br>to know this of what kind are those regions? What fruits do they bring?<br>What is the highest object there which the denizens thereof succeeds in<br>winning? What are its virtues? How also do men, freed from every kind of<br>anxiety, succeed in going to those regions? For what period does the<br>giver of a cow enjoy the fruits that are borne by his gift? How may<br>persons make gifts of many kine and how may they make gifts of a few<br>kine? What are the merits attaching to gifts of many kine and what those<br>that attach to gifts of a few only? How also do persons become givers of<br>kine without giving any kine in reality? Do thou tell me all this. How<br>does one making gifts of even many kine, O puissant lord, become the<br>equal of one that has made gift of only a few kine? How also does one who<br>make gifts of only a few kine succeed in becoming the equal of one who<br>has made gifts of many kine? What kind or Dakshina is regarded as<br>distinguished for pre-eminence in the matter of gifts of kine? It<br>behoveth thee, O holy one, to discourse unto me on all this agreeably to<br>truth.'"
