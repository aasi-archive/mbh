                            "Yudhishthira said, 'I desire thee, O grandsire, to tell me what the<br>ordinances are that have been laid down by the acts touching the deities<br>and the (deceased) ancestors on occasions of Sraddhas.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Having purified oneself (by baths and other purificatory<br>acts) and then going through the well-known auspicious rites, one should<br>carefully do all act relating to the deities in the forenoon, and all<br>acts relating to the Pitris in the afternoon. What is given to men should<br>be given in the midday with affection and regard. That gift which is made<br>untimely is appropriated by Rakshasas.[211] Gifts of articles that have<br>been leapt over by any one, o been licked or sucked, that are not given<br>peacefully, that have been seen by women that are impure in consequence<br>of their season having come, do not produce any merit. Such gifts are<br>regarded as the portion belonging to the Rakshasas. Gifts of articles<br>that have been proclaimed before many people or from which a portion has<br>been eaten by a Sudra, or that have been seen or licked by a dog, form<br>portions of Rakshasas. Food which is mixed with hair or in which there<br>are worms, or which has been stained with spittle or saliva or which has<br>been gazed at by a dog or into which tear-drops have fallen or which has<br>been trodden upon should be known as forming the portion of Rakshasa.<br>Food that has been eaten by a person incompetent to utter the syllable<br>Om, or that has been eaten by a person bearing arms, O Bharata, or that<br>has been eaten by a wicked person should be known to form the portion of<br>Rakshasas.[212] The food that is eaten by a person from which a portion<br>has already been eaten by another, or which is eaten without a part<br>thereof having been offered to deities and guests and children, is<br>appropriated by Rakshasas. Such stained food, if offered to the deities<br>and Pitris is never accepted by them but is appropriated by Rakshasas.<br>The food offered by the three regenerate classes in Sraddhas, in which<br>Mantras are either not uttered or uttered incorrectly and in which the<br>ordinances laid down in the scriptures are not complied with, if<br>distributed to guests and other people, is appropriated by Rakshasas. The<br>food that is distributed to guests without having been previously<br>dedicated to the deities or the Pitris with the aid of libation on the<br>sacred fire, which has been stained in consequence of a portion thereof<br>having been eaten by a person that is wicked or of irreligious behaviour,<br>should be known to form the portion of Rakshasas.'<br><br>"'I have told thee what the portions are of the Rakshasas. Listen now to<br>me as I lay down the rules for ascertaining who the Brahmana is that is<br>deserving of gift.[213] All Brahmanas that have been outcasted (on<br>account of the commission of heinous sins), as also Brahmanas that are<br>idiots and out of mind, do not deserve to be invited to Sraddhas in which<br>offerings are made to either the deities or the Pitris. That Brahmana who<br>is afflicted with leucoderma, or he that is destitute of virility, or he<br>that has got leprosy, or he that has got phthisis or he that is labouring<br>under epilepsy (with delusions of the sensorium), or he that is blind,<br>should not, O king, be invited.[214] Those Brahmanas that practise the<br>calling of physicians, those that receive regular pay for worshipping the<br>images of deities established by the rich, or live upon the service of<br>the deities, those that are observant of vows from pride or other false<br>motives, and those that sell Soma, do not deserve to be invited. Those<br>Brahmanas that are, by profession, vocalists, or dancers or players or<br>instrumental musicians, or reciters of sacred books, or warriors and<br>athletes, do not, O king, deserve to be invited. Those Brahmanas who pour<br>libations on the sacred fire for Sudras, or who are preceptors of Sudras,<br>or who as servants of Sudra masters, do not deserve to be invited. That<br>Brahmana who is paid for his services as preceptor, or who attends as<br>pupil upon the lectures of some preceptor because of some allowance that<br>is granted to him, does not deserve to be invited, for both of them are<br>regarded as sellers of Vedic lore. That Brahmana who has been once<br>induced to accept the gift of food in a Sraddha at the very outset, as<br>also he who has married a Sudra wife, even if possessed of every kind of<br>knowledge do not deserve to be invited.[215] Those Brahmanas that are<br>destitute of their domestic fire, and they that attend upon corpses, they<br>that are thieves, and they that have otherwise fallen away do not, O<br>king, deserve to be invited.[216] Those Brahmanas whose antecedents are<br>not known or are vile, and they that are Putrika-putras, do not, O king,<br>deserve to be invited on occasions of Sraddhas.[217] That Brahmana who<br>gives loans of money, or he who subsists upon the interest of the loans<br>given by him, or he who lives by sale of living creatures, does not<br>deserve, O king, to be invited. Persons who have been subjugated by their<br>wives, or they who live by becoming the paramours of unchaste women, or<br>they who abstain from their morning and evening prayers do not deserve, O<br>king, to be invited to Sraddhas.'<br><br>"'Listen now to me as I mention who the Brahmana is that has been<br>ordained for acts done in honour of the deities and the Pitris. Indeed, I<br>shall tell thee what those merits, are in consequence of which one may<br>become a giver or a recipient of gifts in Sraddhas (notwithstanding the<br>faults mentioned above).[218] Those Brahmanas that are observant of the<br>rites and ceremonies laid down in the scriptures, or they that are<br>possessed of merit, or they that are conversant with the Gayatri, or they<br>that are observant of the ordinary duties of Brahmanas, even if they<br>happen to betake themselves to agriculture for a living, are capable, O<br>king, of being invited to Sraddhas. If a Brahmana happens to be wellborn,<br>he deserves to be invited to Sraddhas notwithstanding his profession of<br>arms for fighting the battle of others.[219] That Brahmana, however, O<br>son, who happens to betake himself to trade for a living should be<br>discarded (even if possessed of merit). The Brahmana who pours libations<br>every day on the sacred fire, or who resides in a fixed habitation, who<br>is not a thief and who does the duties of hospitality to guests arrived<br>at his house, deserves, O king, to be invited to Sraddhas. The Brahmana,<br>O chief of Bharata's race, who recites the Savitri morning, noon, and<br>night, or who subsists upon eleemosynary charity, who is observant of the<br>rites and ceremonies laid down in the scriptures for persons of his<br>order, deserves, O king, to be invited to Sraddhas.[220] That Brahmana<br>who having earned wealth in the morning becomes poor in the afternoon, or<br>who poor in the morning becomes wealthy in the evening or who is<br>destitute of malice, or is stained by a minor fault, deserves, O king, to<br>be invited to Sraddhas. That Brahmana who is destitute of pride or sin,<br>who is not given to dry disputation, or who subsists upon alms obtained<br>in his rounds of mendicancy from house to house deserves, O king, to be<br>invited to sacrifices. One who is not observant of vows, or who is<br>addicted to falsehood (in both speech and conduct), who is a thief, or<br>who subsists by the sale of living creatures or by trade in general,<br>becomes worthy of invitation to Sraddhas, O king, if he happens to offer<br>all to the deities first and subsequently drink Soma. That man who having<br>acquired wealth by foul or cruel means subsequently spends it in adoring<br>the deities and discharging the duties of hospitality, becomes worthy, O<br>king, of being invited to Sraddhas. The wealth that one has acquired by<br>the sale of Vedic lore, or which has been earned by a women, or which has<br>been gained by meanness (such as giving false evidence in a court of<br>law), should never be given to Brahmanas or spent in making offerings to<br>the Pitris. That Brahmana, O chief of Bharata's race, who upon the<br>completion of a Sraddha that is performed with his aid, refuses to utter<br>the words 'astu swadha,' incurs the sin of swearing falsely in a suit for<br>land.[221] The time for performing Sraddha, O Yudhishthira, is that when<br>one obtains a good Brahmana and curds and ghee and the sacred day of the<br>new moon, and the meat of wild animals such as deer and others.[222] Upon<br>the completion of a Sraddha performed by a Brahmana the word Swadha<br>should be uttered. If performed by a Kshatriya the words that should be<br>uttered are&#8212;Let thy Pitris be gratified.&#8212;Upon the completion of a<br>Sraddha performed by a Vaisya, O Bharata, the words that should be<br>uttered are&#8212;Let everything become inexhaustible.&#8212;Similarly, upon the<br>conclusion of a Sraddha performed by a Sudra, the word that should be<br>uttered is Swasti,&#8212;In respect of a Brahmana, the declaration regarding<br>Punyaham should be accompanied with the utterance of the syllable Om. In<br>the case of a Kshatriya, such declaration should be without the utterance<br>of syllable Om. In the rites performed by a Vaisya, the words that should<br>be uttered, instead of beings the syllable Om, are,&#8212;Let the deities be<br>gratified.[223]&#8212;Listen now to me as I tell thee the rites that should be<br>performed, one after another, conformably to the ordinances, (in respect<br>of all the orders). All the rites that go by the name of Jatakarma, O<br>Bharata, are indispensable in the case of all the three orders (that are<br>regenerate). All these rites, O Yudhishthira, in the case of both<br>Brahmanas and Kshatriyas as also in that of Vaisyas are to be performed<br>with the aid of mantras. The girdle of a Brahmana should be made of Munja<br>grass. That for one belonging to the royal order should be a bowstring.<br>The Vaisya's girdle should be made of the Valwaji grass. Even this is<br>what has been laid down in the scriptures. Listen now to me as I expound<br>to thee what constitutes the merits and faults of both givers and<br>recipients of gifts. A Brahmana becomes guilty of a dereliction of duty<br>by uttering a falsehood. Such an act on his part is sinful. A Kshatriya<br>incurs four times and a Vaisya eight times the sin that a Brahmana incurs<br>by uttering a falsehood. A Brahmana should not eat elsewhere, having been<br>previously invited by a Brahmana. By eating at the house of the person<br>whose invitation has been posterior in point of time, he becomes inferior<br>and even incurs the sin that attaches to the slaughter of an animal on<br>occasions other than those of sacrifices.[224] So also, if he eats<br>elsewhere after having been invited by a person of the royal order or a<br>Vaisya, he falls away from his position and incurs half the sin that<br>attaches to the slaughter of an animal on occasions other than those of<br>sacrifices. That Brahmana, O king, who eats on occasions of such rites as<br>are performed in honour of the deities or the Pitris by Brahmanas and<br>Kshatriyas and Vaisyas, without having performed his ablutions, incurs<br>the sin of uttering an untruth for a cow. That Brahmana, O king, who eats<br>on occasions of similar rites performed by persons belonging to the three<br>higher orders, at a time when he is impure in consequence either of a<br>birth or a death among his cognates, through temptation, knowing well<br>that he is impure incurs the same sin.[225] He who lives upon wealth<br>obtained under false pretences like that of sojourns to sacred places or<br>who solicits the giver for wealth pretending that he would spend it in<br>religious acts, incurs, O monarch, the sin of uttering a falsehood.[226]<br>That person, belonging to any of the three higher orders, O Yudhishthira,<br>who at Sraddhas and on other occasions distributes food with the aid of<br>Mantras, unto such Brahmanas as do not study the Vedas and as are not<br>observant of vows, or as have not purified their conduct, certainly<br>incurs sin.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'I desire, O grandsire, to know by giving unto whom<br>the things dedicated to the deities and the Pitris, one may earn the<br>amplest rewards.'<br><br>"Bhishma said,&#8212;'Do thou, Yudhishthira, feed those Brahmanas whose<br>spouses reverently wait for the remnants of the dishes of their husbands<br>like tillers of the soil waiting in reverence for timely showers of rain.<br>One earn great merit by making gifts unto those Brahmanas that are always<br>observant of pure conduct, O king, that are emaciated through abstention<br>from all luxuries and even full meals, that are devoted to the<br>observances of such vows as lead to the emaciation of the body, and that<br>approach givers with the desire of obtaining gifts. By making gifts unto<br>such Brahmanas as regard conduct in this light of food, as regard conduct<br>in the light of spouses and children, as regard conduct in the light of<br>strength, as regard conduct in the light of their refuge for crossing<br>this world and attaining to felicity in the next, and as solicit wealth<br>only when wealth is absolutely needed, one earns great merit. By making<br>gifts unto those persons, O Yudhishthira, that having lost everything<br>through thieves or oppressors, approach the giver, one acquires great<br>merit.[227] By making gifts unto such Brahmanas as solicit food from the<br>hands of even a poor person of their order who has just got something<br>from others, one earns great merit. By making gifts unto such Brahmanas<br>as have lost their all in times of universal distress and as have been<br>deprived of their spouses on such occasions, and as come to givers with<br>solicitations for alms, one acquires great merit. By making gifts unto<br>such Brahmanas as are observant of vows, and as place themselves<br>voluntarily under painful rules and regulations, as are respectful in<br>their conduct to the declaration laid down in the Vedas, and as come to<br>solicit wealth for spending it upon the rites necessary to complete their<br>vows and other observances, one earns great merit. By making gifts unto<br>such Brahmanas as live at a great distance from the practices that are<br>observed by the sinful and the wicked, as are destitute of strength for<br>want of adequate support, and as are very poor in earthly possessions,<br>one earns great merit. By making gifts unto such Brahmanas as have been<br>robbed of all their possessions by powerful men but as are perfectly<br>innocent, and as desire to fill their stomachs any how without, that is,<br>any scruples respecting the quality of the food they take, one earns<br>great merit. By making gifts unto such Brahmanas as beg on behalf of<br>others that are observant of penances and devoted to them and as are<br>satisfied with even small gifts, one earns great merit. Thou hast now, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, heard what the declarations are of the scriptures<br>in respect of the acquisition of great merit by the making of gifts.<br>Listen now to me as I expound what those acts are that lead to hell or<br>heaven. They, O Yudhishthira, that speak an untruth on occasions other<br>than those when such untruth is needed for serving the purpose of the<br>preceptor or for giving the assurance of safety to a person in fear of<br>his life, sink into hell[228]. They who ravish other people's spouses, or<br>have sexual congress with them, or assist at such acts of delinquency,<br>sink in hell. They who rob others of their wealth or destroy the wealth<br>and possessions of other people, or proclaim the faults of other people,<br>sink in hell. They who destroy the containers of such pieces of water as<br>are used by cattle for quenching thirst, as injure such buildings as are<br>used for purposes of public meetings, as break down bridges and<br>causeways, and as pull down houses used for purposes of habitation, have<br>to sink to hell. They who beguile and cheat helpless women, or girls, or<br>aged dames, or such women as have been frightened, have to sink to hell.<br>They who destroy the means of other people's living, they who exterminate<br>the habitations of other people, they who rob others of their spouses,<br>they who sow dissensions among friends, and they who destroy the hopes of<br>other people, sink into hell. They who proclaim the faults of others,<br>they who break down bridges or causeways, they who live by following<br>vocations laid down for other people, and they who are ungrateful to<br>friends for services received, have to sink in hell. They who have no<br>faith in the Vedas and show no reverence for them, they who break the<br>vows made by themselves or oblige others to break them, and they who fall<br>away from their status through sin, sink in hell. They who betake<br>themselves to improper conduct, they who take exorbitant rates of<br>interest, and they who make unduly large profits on sales, have to sink<br>in hell. They who are given to gambling, they who indulge in wicked acts<br>without any scruple, and they who are given to slaughter of living<br>creatures, have to sink in hell. They who cause the dismissal by masters<br>of servants that are hoping for rewards or are expectant of definite need<br>or are in the enjoyment of wages or salaries or are waiting for returns<br>in respect of valuable services already rendered, have to sink in hell.<br>They who themselves eat without offering portions thereof unto their<br>spouse or their sacred fires or their servants or their guests, and they<br>who abstain from performing the rites laid down in the scriptures for<br>honouring the Pitris and deities, have to sink in hell. They who sell the<br>Vedas, they who find fault with the Vedas, and they who reduce the Vedas<br>into writing, have all to sink in hell.[229] They who are out of the pale<br>of the four well-known modes of life, they who betake themselves to<br>practices interdicted by the Srutis and the scriptures, and they who live<br>by betaking themselves to acts that are wicked or sinful or that do not<br>belong to their order of birth, have to sink in hell. They who live by<br>selling hair, they who subsist by selling poisons, and they who live by<br>selling milk, have to sink in hell. They who put obstacles in the path of<br>Brahmanas and kine and maidens, O Yudhishthira, have to sink in hell.<br>They who sell weapons, they who forge weapons, they who make shafts, and<br>they who make bows, have to sink in hell. 'I hey who obstruct paths and<br>roads with stones and thorns and holes have to sink in hell. They who<br>abandon and cast off preceptors and servants and loyal followers without<br>any offence, O chief of Bharata's race, have to sink in hell. They who<br>set bullocks to work before the animals attain to sufficient age, they<br>who bore the noses of bullocks and other animals for controlling them the<br>better while employed in work, and they who keep animals always tethered,<br>have to sink in hell. Those kings that do not protect their subjects<br>while forcibly taking from them a sixth share of the produce of their<br>fields, and they who, though able and possessed of resources, abstain<br>from making gifts, have to sink in hell. They who abandon and cast off<br>persons that are endued with forgiveness and self-restraint and wisdom,<br>or those with whom they have associated for many years, when these are no<br>longer of services to them, have to sink in hell. Those men who<br>themselves eat without giving portions of the food to children and aged<br>men and servants, have to sink in hell.'<br><br>"'All these men enumerated above have to go to hell. Listen now to me, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, as I tell thee who those men are that ascend to<br>heaven. The man who transgresses against a Brahmana by impeding the<br>performances of all such acts in which the deities are adored, becomes<br>afflicted with the loss of all his children and animals. (They who do not<br>transgress against Brahmanas by obstructing their religious acts ascend<br>to heaven). Those men, O Yudhishthira, who follow the duties as laid down<br>in the scriptures for them and practise the virtues of charity and<br>self-restraint and truthfulness, ascend to heaven. Those men who having<br>acquired knowledge by rendering obedient services to their preceptors and<br>observing austere penances, become reluctant to accept gifts, succeed in<br>ascending to heaven. Those men through whom other people are relieved and<br>rescued from fear and sin and the impediments that lie in the way of what<br>they wish to accomplish and poverty and the afflictions of disease,<br>succeed in ascending to heaven. Those men who are endued with a forgiving<br>disposition, who are possessed of patience, who are prompt in performing<br>all righteous acts, and who are of auspicious conduct, succeed in<br>ascending to heaven. Those men who abstain from honey and meat, who<br>abstain from sexual congress with the spouses of other people, and who<br>abstain from wines and spirituous liquors, succeed in ascending to<br>heaven. Those men that help in the establishment of retreats for<br>ascetics, who become founders of families, O Bharata, who open up new<br>countries for purposes of habitation, and lay out towns and cities<br>succeed in ascending to heaven. Those men who give away cloths and<br>ornaments, as also food and drink, and who help in marrying others,<br>succeed in ascending to heaven.[230] Those men that have abstained from<br>all kinds of injury or harm to all creatures, who are capable of enduring<br>everything, and who have made themselves the refuge of all creatures,<br>succeed in ascending to heaven. Those men who wait with humility upon<br>their fathers and mothers, who have subjugated their senses, and who are<br>affectionate towards their brothers, succeed in ascending to heaven.<br>Those men that subjugate their senses notwithstanding the fact of their<br>being rich in worldly goods and strong in might and in the enjoyment of<br>youth, succeed in ascending to heaven. Those men that are kind towards<br>even those that offend against them, that are mild of disposition, that<br>have an affection for all who are of mild behaviour, and that contribute<br>to the happiness of others by rendering them every kind of service in<br>humility, succeed in ascending to heaven. Those men that protect<br>thousands of people, that make gifts unto thousands of people, and that<br>rescue thousands of people from distress, succeed in ascending to heaven.<br>Those men who make gifts of gold and of kine, O chief of Bharata's race,<br>as also those of conveyances and animals, succeed in ascending to heaven.<br>Those men who make gifts of such articles as are needed in marriages, as<br>also those of serving men and maids, and cloths and robes, succeed in<br>ascending to heaven[231]. Those men who make public pleasure-houses and<br>gardens and wells, resting houses and buildings for public meetings and<br>tanks for enabling cattle and men to quench their thirst, and fields for<br>cultivation, O Bharata, succeed in ascending to heaven.[232] Those men<br>who make gifts of houses and fields and populated villages unto persons<br>that solicit them, succeed in ascending to heaven. Those men who having<br>themselves manufactured juicy drinks of sweet taste and seeds and paddy<br>or rice, make gifts of them unto others succeed in ascending to heaven.<br>Those men who being born in families high or low beget hundreds of<br>children and live long lives practising compassion and keeping wrath<br>under complete subjection, succeed in ascending to heaven. I have thus<br>expounded to thee, O Bharata, what the rites are in honour of the deities<br>and the Pitris which are performed by people for the sake of the other<br>world, what the ordinances are in respect of making gifts, and what the<br>views are of the Rishis of former times in respect of both the articles<br>of gift and the manner of giving them.'"
