                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Who are those persons, O Bharata, from whom a<br>Brahmana in this world may accept his food? From whom may a Kshatriya, a<br>Vaisya, and a Sudra take their food respectively?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'A Brahmana may take his food from another Brahmana or<br>from a Kshatriya or a Vaisya, but he must never accept food from a Sudra.<br>A Kshatriya may take his food from a Brahmana, a Kshatriya or a Vaisya.<br>He must, however, eschew food given by Sudras who are addicted to evil<br>ways and who partake of all manner of food without any scruple. Brahmanas<br>and Kshatriyas can partake of food given by such Vaisyas as tend the<br>sacred fire every day, as are faultless in character, and as perform the<br>vow of Chaturmasya. But the man who takes food from a Sudra, swallows the<br>very abomination of the earth, and drinks the excretions of the human<br>body, and partakes of the filth of all the world. He partakes of the very<br>filth of the earth who takes his food thus from a Sudra. Verily, those<br>Brahmanas that take their food from Sudras, take the dirt of the earth.<br>If one engages in the service of a Sudra, one is doomed to perdition<br>though one may duly perform all the rites of one's order. A Brahmana, a<br>Kshatriya, or a Vaisya, so engaging, is doomed, although devoted to the<br>due performance of religious rites. It is said that a Brahmana's duty<br>consists in studying the Vedas and seeking the welfare of the human race;<br>that a Kshatriya's duty consists in protecting men, and that a Vaisya's<br>in promoting their material prosperity. A Vaisya lives by distributing<br>the fruits of his own acts and agriculture. The breeding of kine and<br>trade are the legitimate work in which a Vaisya may engage without fear<br>of censure. The man who abandons his own proper occupation and betakes<br>himself to that of a Sudra, should be considered as a Sudra and on no<br>account should any food be accepted from him. Professors of the healing<br>art, mercenary soldiers, the priest who acts as warder of the house, and<br>persons who devote a whole year to study without any profit, are all to<br>be considered as Sudras. And those who impudently partake of food offered<br>at ceremonials in a Sudra's house are afflicted with a terrible calamity.<br>In consequence of partaking such forbidden food they lose their family,<br>strength, and energy, and attain to the status of animals, descending to<br>the position of dogs, fallen in virtue and devoid of all religious<br>observances. He who takes food from a physician takes that which is no<br>better than excrement; the food of a harlot is like urine; that of a<br>skilled mechanic is like blood. If a Brahmana approved by the good, takes<br>the food of one who lives by his learning, he is regarded as taking the<br>food of a Sudra. All good men should forego such food. The food of a<br>person who is censured by all is said to be like a draught from a pool of<br>blood. The acceptance of food from a wicked person is considered as<br>reprehensible as the slaying of a Brahmana. One should not accept food if<br>one is slighted and not received with due honours by the giver. A<br>Brahmana, who does so, is soon overtaken by disease, and his race soon<br>becomes extinct. By accepting food from the warder of a city, one<br>descends to the status of the lowest outcaste. If a Brahmana accepts food<br>from one who is guilty of killing either a cow or a Brahmana or from one<br>who has committed adultery with his preceptor's wife or from a drunkard,<br>he helps to promote the race of Rakshasas. By accepting food from a<br>eunuch, or from an ungrateful person, or from one who has misappropriated<br>wealth entrusted to his charge, one is born in the country of the Savaras<br>situated beyond the precincts of the middle country. I have thus duly<br>recited to thee the persons from whom food may be accepted and from whom<br>it may not. Now tell me, O son of Kunti, what else thou wishest to hear<br>from me today.'"
