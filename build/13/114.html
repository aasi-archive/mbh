                            "Vaisampayana said, 'After this, king Yudhishthira, endued with great<br>energy, and the foremost of eloquent men, addressed his grandsire lying<br>on his bed of arrows, in the following words.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O thou of great intelligence, the Rishis and<br>Brahmanas and the deities, led by the authority of the Vedas, all applaud<br>that religion which has compassion for its indication. But, O king, whet<br>I ask thee is this: how does a man, who has perpetrated acts of injury to<br>others in word, thought and deed, succeed in cleansing himself from<br>misery?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Utterers of Brahma have said that there are four kinds of<br>compassion or abstention from injury. If even one of those four kinds be<br>not observed, the religion of compassion, it is said, is not observed. As<br>all four-footed animals are incapable of standing on three legs, even so<br>the religion of compassion cannot stand if any of those four divisions or<br>parts be wanting. As the footprints of all other animals are engulfed in<br>those of the elephant, even so all other religions are said to be<br>comprehended in that of compassion. A person becomes guilty of injury<br>through acts, words and thoughts[522]. Discarding it mentally at the<br>outset, one should next discard in word and thought. He who, according to<br>this rule, abstains from eating meat is said to be cleansed in a<br>threefold way. It is heard that utterers of Brahma ascribe to three<br>causes (the sin of eating meat). That sin may attach to the mind, to<br>words, and to acts. It is for this reason that men of wisdom who are<br>endued with penances refrain from eating meat. Listen to me, O king, as I<br>tell thee what the faults are that attach to the eating of meat. The meat<br>of other animals is like the flesh of one's son. That foolish person,<br>stupefied by folly, who eats meat is regarded as the vilest of human<br>beings. The union of father and mother produces an offspring. After the<br>same manner, the cruelty that a helpless and sinful wretch commits,<br>produces its progeny of repeated rebirths fraught with great misery. As<br>the tongue is the cause of the knowledge or sensation of taste, so the<br>scriptures declare, attachment proceeds from taste.[523] Well-dressed,<br>cooked with salt or without salt, meat, in whatever form one may take it,<br>gradually attracts the mind and enslaves it. How will those foolish men<br>that subsist upon meat succeed in listening to the sweet music of<br>(celestial) drums and cymbals and lyres and harps? They who eat meat<br>applaud it highly, suffering themselves to be stupefied by its taste<br>which they pronounce to be something inconceivable, undescribable, and<br>unimaginable. Such praise even of meat is fraught with demerit. In former<br>days, many righteous men, by giving the flesh of their own bodies,<br>protected the flesh of other creatures and as a consequence of such acts<br>of merit, have proceeded to heaven. In this way, O monarch the religion<br>of compassion is surrounded by four considerations. I have thus declared<br>to thee that religion which comprises all other religions within it.'"
