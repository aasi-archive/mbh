                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Who are deserving of worship? Who are they unto whom<br>one may bow? Who are they, O Bharata, unto whom thou wouldst bend thy<br>head? Who, again, are they whom thou likest? Tell me all this, O prince.<br>What is that upon which thy mind dwells when affliction overwhelms thee?<br>Do thou discourse to me on what is beneficial here, that is, in this<br>region of human beings, as also hereafter.'"[10]<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I like those regenerate persons whose highest wealth is<br>Brahman, whose heaven consists in the knowledge of the soul, and whose<br>penances are constituted by their diligent study of the Vedas. My heart<br>yearns after those in whose race persons, young and old diligently bear<br>the ancestral burthens without languishing under them. Brahmanas<br>well-trained in several branches of knowledge, self-controlled,<br>mild-speeched, conversant with the scriptures, well-behaved, possessed of<br>the knowledge of Brahman and righteous in conduct, discourse in<br>respectable assemblies like flights of swans.[11] Auspicious, agreeable,<br>excellent, and well-pronounced are the words, O Yudhishthira, which they<br>utter with a voice as deep as that of the clouds. Fraught with happiness<br>both temporal and spiritual, such words are uttered by them in the courts<br>of monarchs, themselves being received with honour and attention and<br>served with reverence by those rulers of men. Indeed, my heart yearns<br>after them who listen to the words uttered in assemblies or the courts of<br>kings by persons endued with knowledge and all desirable attributes, and<br>are respected by others. My heart, O monarch, always yearns after them<br>who, for the gratification of Brahmanas, O Yudhishthira, give unto them,<br>with devotion, food that is well-cooked and clean and wholesome. It is<br>easy to fight in battle, but not so to make a gift without pride or<br>vanity. In this world, O Yudhishthira, there are brave men and heroes by<br>hundreds. While counting them, he that is a hero in gifts should be<br>regarded as superior, O amiable one, if I had been even a vulgar<br>Brahmana, I would have regarded myself as very great, not to speak of one<br>born in a good Brahmana family endued with righteousness of conduct, and<br>devoted to penances and learning. There is no one, O son of Pandu, in<br>this world that is dearer to me than thou, O chief of Bharata's race but<br>dearer to me than thou are the Brahmanas. And since, O best of the Kurus,<br>the Brahmanas are very much dearer to me than thou, it is by that truth<br>that I hope to go to all those regions of felicity which have been<br>acquired by my sire Santanu. Neither my sire, nor my sire's sire, nor any<br>one else connected with me by blood, is dearer to me than the Brahmanas.<br>I do not expect any fruit, small or great, from my worship of the<br>Brahmanas (for I worship them as deities because they are deserving of<br>such worship).[12] In consequence of what I have done to the Brahmanas in<br>thought, word, and deed, I do not feel any pain now (even though I am<br>lying on a bed of arrows). People used to call me as one devoted to the<br>Brahmanas. This style of address always pleased me highly. To do good to<br>the Brahmanas is the most sacred of all sacred acts. I behold many<br>regions of beautitude waiting for me that have reverentially walked<br>behind the Brahmanas. Very soon shall I repair to those regions for<br>everlasting time, O son. In this world, O Yudhishthira, the duties of<br>women have reference to and depend upon their husbands. To a woman,<br>verily, the husband is the deity and he is the highest end after which<br>she should strive. As the husband is to the wife, even so are the<br>Brahmanas unto Kshatriyas. If there be a Kshatriya of full hundred years<br>of age and a good Brahmana child of only ten years, the latter should be<br>regarded as a father and the former as a son, for among the two, verily,<br>the Brahmana is superior. A woman in the absence of her husband, takes<br>his younger brother for her lord; even so the Earth, not having obtained<br>the: Brahmana, made the Kshatriya her lord. The Brahmanas should be<br>protected like sons and worshipped like sires or preceptors. Indeed, O<br>best of the Kurus, they should be waited upon with reverence even as<br>people wait with reverence upon their sacrificial or Homa fires. The<br>Brahmanas are endued with simplicity and righteousness. They are devoted<br>to truth. They are always engaged in the good of every creature. Yet when<br>angry they are like snakes of virulent poison. They should, for these<br>reasons, be always waited upon and served with reverence and humility.<br>One should, O Yudhishthira, always fear these two, viz. Energy and<br>Penances. Both these should be avoided or kept at a distance. The effects<br>of both are speedy. There is the superiority, however, of Penances, viz.,<br>that Brahmanas endued with Penances, O monarch, can, if angry, slay the<br>object of their wrath (regardless of the measure of Energy with which<br>that object may be endued). Energy and Penances, each of the largest<br>measure, become neutralised if applied against a Brahmana that has<br>conquered wrath. If the two,&#8212;that is, Energy and Penances,&#8212;be set<br>against each other, then destruction would overtake both but not<br>destruction without, a remnant, for while Energy, applied against<br>Penances, is sure to be destroyed without leaving a remnant. Penances<br>applied against Energy cannot be destroyed completely.[13] As the<br>herdsman, stick in hand, protects the herd, even so should the Kshatriya<br>always protect the Vedas and the Brahmanas. Indeed, the Kshatriya should<br>protect all righteous Brahmanas even as a sire protects his sons. He<br>should always have his eye upon the house of the Brahmanas for seeing<br>that their means of subsistence may not be wanting.'"
