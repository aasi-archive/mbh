                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O royal son of Bharata's race, it behoveth thee to<br>answer this question of mine truly and in detail. What are those<br>circumstances under which a person may become guilty of Brahmanicide<br>without actually slaying a Brahmana!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Formerly, O monarch, I had one day requested Vyasa to<br>explain to me this very subject. I shall now narrate to thee what Vyasa<br>told me on that occasion. Do thou listen to it with undivided attention.<br>Repairing to the presence of Vyasa, I addressed him, saying,&#8212;Thou, O<br>great ascetic, art the fourth in descent from Vasishtha. Do thou explain<br>to me this. What are those circumstances under which one becomes guilty<br>of Brahmanicide without actually slaying a Brahmana,&#8212;Thus addressed by<br>me, the son of Parasara's loins, O king, well-skilled 'n the science of<br>morality, made me the following answer, at once excellent and fraught<br>with certainty, Thou shouldst know that man as guilty of Brahmanicide who<br>having of his own will invited a Brahmana of righteous conduct to his<br>house for giving him alms subsequently refuses to give anything to him on<br>the pretence of there being nothing in the house. Thou shouldst, O<br>Bharata, know that man as guilty of Brahmanicide who destroys the means<br>of living of a Brahmana learned in the Vedas and all their branches, and<br>who is freed from attachments to worldly creatures and goods. Thou<br>shouldst, O king, know that man to be guilty of Brahmanicide, who causes<br>obstructions in the way of thirsty kine while employed in quenching that<br>thirst. Thou shouldst take that man as guilty of Brahmanicide who,<br>without studying the Srutis that have flowed from preceptor to pupil for<br>ages and ages together, finds fault with the Srutis or with those<br>scriptures that have been composed by the Rishis. Thou shouldst know that<br>man as guilty of Brahmanicide who does not bestow upon a suitable<br>bride-groom his daughter possessed of beauty and other excellent<br>accomplishments. Thou shouldst know that foolish and sinful person to be<br>guilty of Brahmanicide who inflicts such grief upon Brahmanas as afflict<br>the very core of their hearts. Thou shouldst know that man to be guilty<br>of Brahmanicide who robs the blind, the lame, and idiots of their all.<br>Thou shouldst know that man to be guilty of Brahmanicide who sets fire to<br>the retreats of ascetics or to woods or to a village or a town.'"
