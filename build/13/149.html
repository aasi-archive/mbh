                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having heard all the duties in their entirety and<br>all those sacred acts and objects that cleanse human beings of their<br>sins. Yudhishthira once more addressed the son of Santanu in the<br>following words.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, "Who may be said to be the one god in the world? Who<br>may be said to be the one object which is our sole refuge? Who is he by<br>worshipping whom or hymning whose praises human being would get what is<br>beneficial? What religion is that which, according to thy judgment, is<br>the foremost of all religions? What are those Mantras by reciting which a<br>living creature becomes freed from the bonds of birth and life?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'One should always, with alacrity and throwing away all<br>languor, hymn the praises of that Lord of the universe, that god of gods<br>(viz., Vasudeva), who is Infinite and the foremost of all Beings, by<br>uttering His thousand names. By always worshipping with reverence and<br>devotion that immutable Being, by meditating on him, by hymning His<br>praises and bowing the head unto Him, and by performing sacrifices unto<br>Him, indeed by always praising Vishnu, who is without beginning and<br>without end or destruction, who is the Supreme Lord of all the worlds,<br>and who is the Master and Controller of the universe, one can succeed in<br>transcending all sorrow. Verily, He is devoted to the Brahmanas,<br>conversant with all duties and practices, the enhancer of the fame and<br>achievement of all persons, the master of all the worlds, exceedingly<br>wonderful, and the prime cause of the origin of all creatures. Even this,<br>in my judgment, is the foremost religion of all religions, viz., one<br>should always worship and hymn the praises of the lotus-eyed Vasudeva<br>with devotion. He is the highest Energy. He is the highest Penance. He is<br>the highest Brahma. He is the highest refuge. He is the most holy of all<br>holies, the most auspicious of all auspicious objects. He is the god of<br>all the gods and He is the immutable father of all creatures. On the<br>advent of the primal Yuga, all creatures spring from Him. On the<br>expiration, again of a Yuga, all things disappear in Him.[590] Hear, O<br>king, the thousand names, possessed of great efficacy in destroying sins,<br>of that foremost one in all the worlds that Master of the universe, viz.,<br>Vishnu. All those names derived from His attributes, secret and<br>well-known, of the high-souled Vasudeva which were sung by Rishis, I<br>shall recite to thee for the good of all. They are, Om! He that enters<br>all things, besides Himself, He that covers all things, He unto whom<br>sacrificial libations are poured, the Lord of the Past, the Present, and<br>the Future, the Creator (or Destroyer) of all existent things, the<br>upholder of all existent things, the Existent, the Soul of all, the<br>Originator of all things (I&#8212;IX); of cleansed Soul, the Supreme Soul, the<br>highest Refuge of all emancipated persons, the Immutable, He that lies<br>enclosed in a case, the Witness, He that knows the material case in which<br>He resides, the Indestructible (X&#8212;XVII);[591] He upon whom the mind<br>rests during Yoga-abstraction, the Guide or leader of all persons<br>conversant with Yoga, the Lord of both Pradhana (or Prakriti) and<br>Purusha.

He that upholds the universe (in the form of Ananta and<br>others), He that ordains all acts and their fruits, He that is superior<br>to the Grandsire Brahma (XXXVIII&#8212;XLVI);[594] the Immeasurable, the Lord<br>of the senses (or He that has curled locks), He from whose navel the<br>primeval lotus sprang, the Lord of all the deities, the Artificer of the<br>universe, the Mantra, He that weakens or emaciates all things, He that is<br>vast, the Ancient one, He that is enduring (XLVII&#8212;LVI).[595] He that is<br>incapable of being seized (by either the senses or the mind), the Eternal<br>One, Krishna, the Red-eyed, He that kills all creatures at the time of<br>the universal dissolution, He that is vast for knowledge and puissance<br>and other attributes of the kind, He that resides in three parts (above,<br>middle, and below) of every, creature. That which cleanses, is<br>auspicious, and high (LVII&#8212;LXIV).[596] He that urges all creatures in<br>respect of all their acts. He that causes the life-breaths to act. He<br>that causes all living creatures to live, the Eldest, the Foremost of all<br>those that are regarded as the Lords of all creatures, He that has gold<br>in his abdomen, He that has the Earth for his abdomen, the Lord of Sri or<br>Lakshmi, the Slayer of Madhu (LXV&#8212;LXXII)[597]: the Omnipotent, He that<br>is endued with great prowess, He that is armed with the bow, He that is<br>Possessed of a mind capable of bearing the contents of all treatises, He<br>that roves through the universe, riding on Garuda.

Om, salutations to Him!<br><br>'Even thus have I recited to thee, without any exception, the thousand<br>excellent names of the high-souled Kesava whose glory should always be<br>sung That man who hears the names every day or who recites them every<br>day, never meets with any evil either here or hereafter. If a Brahmana<br>does this he succeeds in mastering the Vedanta; if a Kshatriya does it,<br>he becomes always successful in battle. A Vaisya, by doing it, becomes<br>possessed of affluence, while a Sudra earns great happiness. If one<br>becomes desirous of earning the merit of righteousness, one succeeds in<br>earning it (by hearing or reciting these names). If it is wealth that one<br>desires, one succeeds in earning wealth (by acting in this way). So also<br>the man who wishes for enjoyments of the senses succeeds in enjoying all<br>kinds of pleasures, and the man desirous of offspring acquires offspring<br>(by pursuing this course of conduct). That man who with devotion and<br>perseverance and heart wholly turned towards him, recites these thousand<br>names of Vasudeva every day, after having purified himself, succeeds in<br>acquiring great fame, a position of eminence among his kinsmen, enduring<br>prosperity, and lastly, that which is of the highest benefit to him<br>(viz., emancipation itself). Such a man never meets with fear at any<br>time, and acquires great prowess and energy. Disease never afflicts him;<br>splendour of complexion, strength, beauty, and accomplishments become<br>his. The sick become hale, the afflicted become freed from their<br>afflictions; the affrighted become freed from fear, and he that is<br>plunged in calamity becomes freed from calamity. The man who hymns the<br>praises of that foremost of Beings by reciting His thousand names with<br>devotion succeeds in quickly crossing all difficulties. That mortal who<br>takes refuge in Vasudeva and who becomes devoted to Him, becomes freed of<br>all sins and attains to eternal Brahma. They who are devoted to Vasudeva<br>have never to encounter any evil. They become freed from the fear of<br>birth, death, decrepitude, and disease. That man who with devotion and<br>faith recites this hymn (consisting of the thousand names of Vasudeva)<br>succeeds in acquiring felicity of soul, forgiveness of disposition,<br>Prosperity, intelligence, memory, and fame. Neither wrath, nor jealousy,<br>nor cupidity, nor evil understanding ever appears in those men of<br>righteousness who are devoted to that foremost of beings. The firmament<br>with the sun, moon and stars, the welkin, the points of the compass, the<br>earth and the ocean, are all held and supported by the prowess of the<br>high-souled Vasudeva. The whole mobile and immobile universe with the<br>deities, Asuras, and Gandharvas, Yakshas, Uragas and Rakshasas, is under<br>the sway of Krishna. The senses, mind, understanding, life, energy,<br>strength and memory, it has been said, have Vasudeva for their soul.<br>Indeed, this body that is called Kshetra, and the intelligent soul<br>within, that is called the knower of Kshetra, also have Vasudeva for<br>their soul. Conduct (consisting of practices) is said to be the foremost<br>of all topics treated of in the scriptures. Righteousness has conduct for<br>its basis. The unfading Vasudeva is said to be the lord of righteousness.<br>The Rishis, the Pitris, the deities, the great (primal) elements, the<br>metals, indeed, the entire mobile and immobile universe, has sprung from<br>Narayana. Yoga, the Sankhya Philosophy, knowledge, all mechanical arts,<br>the Vedas, the diverse scriptures, and all learning, have sprung from<br>Janardana. Vishnu is the one great element or substance which has spread<br>itself out into multifarious forms. Covering the three worlds, He the<br>soul of all things, enjoys them all. His glory knows no diminution, and<br>He it is that is the Enjoyer of the universe (as its Supreme Lord). This<br>hymn in praise of the illustrious Vishnu composed by Vyasa, should be<br>recited by that person who wishes to acquire happiness and that which is<br>the highest benefit (viz., emancipation). Those persons that worship and<br>adore the Lord of the universe, that deity who is inborn and possessed of<br>blazing effulgence, who is the origin or cause of the universe, who knows<br>on deterioration, and who is endued with eyes that are as large and<br>beautiful as the petals of the lotus, have never to meet with any<br>discomfiture.'"
