                            "Vasishtha said, 'The kine that had been created in a former age<br>practised the austerest penances for a hundred thousand years with the<br>desire of attaining to a position of great pre-eminence. Verily, O<br>scorcher of foes, they said unto themselves,&#8212;We shall, in this world,<br>become the best of all kinds of Dakshina in sacrifices, and we shall not<br>be liable to be stained with any fault! By bathing in water mixed with<br>our dung people shall become sanctified. The deities and men shall use<br>our dung for the purpose of purifying all creatures mobile and immobile.<br>They also that will give us away shall attain to those regions of<br>happiness which will be ours.[376]&#8212;The puissant Brahman, appearing unto<br>them at the conclusion of their austerities, gave them the boons they<br>sought, saying,&#8212;it shall be as ye wish! Do ye (thus) rescue all the<br>worlds!&#8212;Crowned with fruition in respect of their wishes, they all rose<br>up,&#8212;those mothers of both the Past and the Future. Every morning, people<br>should bow with reverence unto kine. As the consequence of this, they are<br>certain to win prosperity. At the conclusion of their penances O monarch,<br>kine became the refuge of the world. It is for this that kine are said to<br>be highly blessed, sacred, and the foremost of all things. It is for this<br>kine are said to stay at the very head of all creatures. By giving away a<br>Kapila cow with a calf resembling herself, yielding a copious measure of<br>milk, free from every vicious habit, and covered with a piece of cloth,<br>the giver attains to great honours in the region of Brahma. By giving<br>away a cow of red complexion, with a calf that resembles herself,<br>yielding milk, free from every vice, and covered with a piece of cloth,<br>one attains to great honours in the region of Surya. By giving away a cow<br>of variegated hue, with a calf similar to herself, yielding milk, free<br>from every vice, and covered with a piece of cloth, one attains to great<br>honours in the region of Soma. By giving away a cow of white complexion,<br>with a calf similar to herself, yielding milk, free from every vice, and<br>covered with a piece of cloth, one attains to great honours in the region<br>of Indra. By giving away a cow of dark complexion, with a calf similar to<br>herself, yielding milk, free from every vice, and covered with a piece of<br>cloth, one attains to great honours in the region of Agni. By giving away<br>a cow of the complexion of smoke, with a calf similar to herself,<br>yielding milk, free from every vice, and covered with a piece of cloth,<br>one attains to great honours in the region of Yama. By giving away a cow<br>of the complexion of the foam of water, with a calf and a vessel of white<br>brass for milking her, and covered with a piece of cloth, one attains to<br>the region of Varuna. By giving away a cow whose complexion is like that<br>of the dust blown by the wind, with a calf, and a vessel of white brass<br>for milking her, and covered with a piece of cloth, one attains to great<br>honours in the region of the Wind-god. By giving a cow of the complexion<br>of gold, having eyes of a tawny hue with a calf and a vessel of white<br>brass for milking her and covered with a piece of cloth, one enjoys the<br>felicity of the region of Kuvera. By giving away a cow of the complexion<br>of the smoke of straw, with a calf and a vessel of white brass for<br>milking her, and covered with a piece of cloth, one attains to great<br>honours in the region of the Pitris. By giving away a fat cow with the<br>flesh of its throat hanging down and accompanied by her calf, one attains<br>with ease to the high region of the Viswedevas. By giving away a Gouri<br>cow, with calf similar to her, yielding milk, free from every vice, and<br>covered with a piece of cloth, one attains to the region of the Vasus. By<br>giving away a cow of the complexion of a white blanket, with a calf and a<br>vessel of white brass, and covered with a piece of cloth, one attains to<br>the region of the Sadhyas. By giving away a bull with a high hump and<br>adorned with every jewel, the giver, O king, attains to the region of the<br>Maruts. By giving away a bull of blue complexion, that is full-grown in<br>respect of years and adorned with every ornament, the giver attains to<br>the regions of the Gandharvas and the Apsaras. By giving away a cow with<br>the flesh of her throat hanging down, and adorned with every ornament,<br>the giver, freed from every grief, attains to those regions that belong<br>to Prajapati himself. That man, O king, habitually makes gifts of kine,<br>proceed, piercing through the clouds, on a car of solar effulgence to<br>Heaven and shines there in splendour. That man who habitually makes gifts<br>of kine comes to be regarded as the foremost of his species. When thus<br>proceeding to Heaven, he is received by a thousand celestial damsels of<br>beautiful hips and adorned with handsome robes and ornaments. These girls<br>wait upon him there and minister to his delight. He sleeps there in peace<br>and is awakened by the musical laughter of those gazelle-eyed damsels,<br>the sweet notes of their Vinas, the soft strains of their Vallakis, and<br>the melodious tinkle of their Nupuras.[377] The men who makes gifts of<br>kine resides in Heaven and is honoured there for as many years as there<br>are hairs on the bodies of the kine he gives away. Falling off from<br>Heaven (upon the exhaustion of his merit), such a man takes birth in the<br>order of humanity and, in fact, in a superior family among men.'"
