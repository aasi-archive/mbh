                            "Yudhishthira said, 'After the Rishi had disappeared, what did the king<br>do and what also did highly-blessed spouse do? Tell me this, O grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Having lost sight of the Rishi, the king, overwhelmed<br>with shame, toil-worn and losing his senses, returned to his palace,<br>accompanied by his queen. Entering his mansion in a cheerless mood, he<br>spoke not a word with any one. He thought only of that conduct of<br>Chyavana. With a despairing heart he then proceeded to his chamber. There<br>he saw the son of Bhrigu stretched as before on his bed. Beholding the<br>Rishi there, they wondered much. Indeed, they began to reflect upon that<br>very strange incident. The sight of the Rishi dispelled their fatigue.<br>Taking their seats once more by his side, they again set themselves to<br>gently press his feet as before. Meanwhile, the great ascetic continued<br>to sleep soundly as before. Only, he now lay on another side. Endued with<br>great energy, he thus passed another period measured by one and twenty<br>day. Agitated by their fears, the royal couple showed no change in their<br>attitude or sentiment towards the Rishi. Awaking then from his slumber,<br>the ascetic addressed the king and the queen, saying, 'Do ye rub my body<br>with oil. I wish to have a bath.' Famishing and toil-worn though they<br>were they readily assented, and soon approached the Rishi with a costly<br>oil that had been prepared by boiling it a hundred times. While the Rishi<br>was seated at his ease, the king and the queen, restraining speech,<br>continued to rub him. Endued with high ascetic merit the son of Bhrigu<br>did not once utter the word 'Sufficient.' Bhrigu's son, however, saw that<br>the royal couple were totally unmoved. Rising up suddenly, he entered the<br>bathing chamber. The diverse article necessary for a bath and such as<br>were fit for a king's use, were ready there. Without honouring, however,<br>any of those articles by appropriating them to his use, the Rishi once<br>more disappeared there and then by his Yoga-power, in the very sight of<br>king Kusika (and his spouse). This, however, O chief of the Bharatas,<br>failed to disturb the equanimity of the royal couple. The next time the<br>puissant Rishi was seen seated, after a bath on the throne. Indeed, it<br>was from that place that he then showed himself to the king and the<br>queen, O delighter of the Kurus. With a cheerful face, king Kusika,<br>together with his wife, then offered the Rishi cooked food with great<br>reverence. Endued with wisdom, and with heart totally unmoved, Kusika<br>made this offer. 'Let the food be brought' were the words that were then<br>uttered by the ascetic. Assisted by his spouse, the king soon brought<br>thither the food. There were diverse kinds of meat and different<br>preparations also thereof. There was a great variety of vegetables also<br>and pot-herbs. There were juicy cakes too among those viands, and several<br>agreeable kinds of confectionery, and solid preparations of milk. Indeed,<br>the viands offered presented different kinds of taste. Among them there<br>was also some food&#8212;the produce of the wilderness&#8212;such as ascetics liked<br>and took. Diverse agreeable kinds of fruit, fit to be eaten by kings,<br>were also there. There were Vadaras and Ingudas and Kasmaryas and<br>Bhallatakas. Indeed, the food that was offered contained such things as<br>are taken by persons leading a domestic mode of life as also such things<br>as are taken by denizens of the wilderness. Through fear of the Rishi's<br>curse, the king had caused all kinds of food to be collected and dressed<br>for his guest. All this food, brought from the kitchen, was placed before<br>Chyavana. A seat was also placed for him and a bed too was spread. The<br>viands were then caused to be covered with white cloths. Soon, however,<br>Chyavana of Bhrigu's race set fire to all the things and reduced them to<br>ashes. Possessed of great intelligence, the royal couple showed no wrath<br>at this conduct of the Rishi, who once more, after this made himself<br>invisible before the very eyes of the king and the queen. The Royal sage<br>Kusika thereupon stood there in the same posture for the whole night,<br>with his spouse by his side, and without speaking a word. Endued with<br>great prosperity, he did not give way to wrath. Every day, good and pure<br>food of diverse kinds, excellent beds, abundant articles needed for bath,<br>and cloths of various kinds, were collected and kept in readiness in the<br>palace for the Rishi. Indeed, Chyavana failed to notice any fault in the<br>conduct of the king. Then the regenerate Rishi, addressing king Kusika,<br>said unto him, 'Do thou with thy spouse, yoke thyself unto a car and bear<br>me on it to whichever place I shall direct.' Without the least scruple,<br>the king answered Chyavana endued with wealth of asceticism, saying, 'So<br>be it!' and he further enquired of the Rishi, asking, 'Which car shall I<br>bring? Shall it be my pleasure-car for making progress of pleasure, or,<br>shall it be my battle-car? Thus addressed by the delighted and contented<br>monarch, the ascetic said unto him, 'Do thou promptly equip that car of<br>thine with which thou penetratest into hostile cities. Indeed that<br>battle-car of thine, with every weapon, with its standard and flags, its<br>darts and javelins and golden columns and poles, should be made ready.<br>Its rattle resembles the tinkling of bells. It is adorned with numerous<br>arches made of pure gold. It is always furnished with high and excellent<br>weapons numbering by hundreds!' The king said, 'So be it!' and soon<br>caused his great battle-car to be equipped. And he yoked his wife thereto<br>on the left and his own self on the right. And the king placed on the<br>car, among its other equipments, the goad which had three handles and<br>which had a point at once hard as the thunderbolt and sharp as the<br>needle.[307] Having placed every requisite upon the car, the king said<br>unto the Rishi, 'O holy one, whither shall the car proceed? O, let the<br>son of Bhrigu issue his command! This thy car shall proceed to the place<br>which thou mayst be pleased to indicate.' Thus addressed the holy man<br>replied unto the king, saying, 'Let the car go hence, dragged slowly,<br>step by step. Obedient to my will, do ye two proceed in such a way that I<br>may not feel any fatigue, I should be borne away pleasantly, and let all<br>thy people see this progress that I make through their midst. Let no<br>person that comes to me, as I proceed along the road, be driven away. I<br>shall make gifts of wealth unto all. Unto them amongst the Brahmanas that<br>may approach me on the way, I shall grant their wishes and bestow upon<br>all of them gems and wealth without stint. Let all this be accomplished,<br>O king, and do not entertain any scruples.' Hearing these words of the<br>Rishi, the king summoned his servants and said, 'Ye should, without any<br>fear, give away whatever the ascetic will order.' Then jewels and gems in<br>abundance, and beautiful women, and pairs of sheep, and coined and<br>uncoined gold, and huge elephants resembling hills or mountain summits,<br>and all the ministers of the king, began to follow the Rishi as he was<br>borne away on that car. Cries of 'Oh' and 'Alas' arose from every part of<br>the city which was plunged in grief at that extraordinary sight. And the<br>king and the queen were suddenly struck by the Rishi with that goad<br>equipped with sharp point. Though thus struck on the back and the cheeks,<br>the royal couple still showed no sign of agitation. On the other hand,<br>they continued to bear the Rishi on as before. Trembling from head to<br>foot, for no food had passed their lips for fifty nights, and exceedingly<br>weak, the heroic couple somehow succeeded in dragging that excellent car.<br>Repeatedly and deeply cut by the goad, the royal couple became covered<br>with blood. Indeed, O monarch, they then looked like a couple of Kinsuka<br>trees in the flowering season. The citizens, beholding the plight to<br>which their king and queen had been reduced, became afflicted with great<br>grief. Filled with fear at the prospect of the curse of the Rishi, they<br>kept silent under their misery. Gathering in knots they said unto each<br>other, 'Behold the might of penances! Although all of us are angry, we<br>are still unable to look at the Rishi! Great is the energy of the holy<br>Rishi of cleaned soul! Behold also the endurance of the king and his<br>royal spouse! Though worn out with toil and hunger, they are still<br>bearing the car! The son of Bhrigu notwithstanding the misery he caused<br>to Kusika and his queen, failed to mark any sign of dissatisfaction or<br>agitation in them.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'The perpetuator of Bhrigu's race beholding the king<br>and the queen totally unmoved, began to give away very largely (wealth<br>obtained from the king's treasury) as if he were a second Lord of<br>Treasures. At this act also, king Kusika Showed no mark of<br>dissatisfaction. He did as the Rishi commanded (in the matter of those<br>gifts). Seeing all this, that illustrious and best of ascetics became<br>delighted. Coming down from that excellent car, he unharnessed the royal<br>couple. Having freed them, he addressed them duly. Indeed, the son of<br>Bhrigu, in a soft, deep, and delighted voice, said, 'I am ready to give<br>an excellent boon unto you both!' Delicate as they were, their bodies had<br>been pierced with the goad. That best of ascetics, moved by affection,<br>softly touched them with his hands whose healing virtues resembled those<br>of nectar itself, O chief of the Bharatas. Then the king answered, 'My<br>wife and I have felt no toil!' Indeed, all their fatigue had been<br>dispelled by the puissance of the Rishi, and hence it was that the king<br>could say so unto the Rishi. Delighted with their conduct, the<br>illustrious Chyavana said unto them, 'I have never before spoken an<br>untruth. It must, therefore, be as I have said. This spot on the banks of<br>the Ganga is very delightful and auspicious. I shall, observant of a vow,<br>dwell for a little while here, O king! Do thou return to thy city. Thou<br>are fatigued! Thou shalt come again. Tomorrow, O king, thou shalt,<br>returning with thy spouse, behold me even here. Thou shouldst not give<br>way to wrath or grief. The time is come when thou shalt reap a great<br>reward! That which is coveted by thee and which is in thy heart shall<br>verily be accomplished.' Thus addressed by the Rishi, king Kusika, with a<br>delighted heart, replied unto the Rishi in these words of grave import,<br>'I have cherished no wrath or grief, O highly-blessed one! We have been<br>cleansed and sanctified by thee, O holy one! We have once more become<br>endued with youth. Behold our bodies have become exceedingly beautiful<br>and possessed of great strength. I do not any longer see those wounds and<br>cicatrices that were caused by thee on our persons with thy goad. Verily,<br>with my spouse, I am in good health. I see my goddess become as beautiful<br>in body as an Apsara. Verily, she is endued with as much comeliness and<br>splendour as she had ever been before. All this, O great ascetic, is due<br>to thy grace. Verily, there is nothing astonishing in all this, O holy<br>Rishi of puissance ever unbaffled.' Thus addressed by the king, Chyavana<br>said unto him, 'Thou shalt, with thy spouse, return hither tomorrow, O<br>monarch!' With these words, the royal sage Kusika was dismissed. Saluting<br>the Rishi, the monarch, endued with a handsome body, returned to his<br>capital like unto a second chief of the celestials. The counsellors then,<br>with the priest, came out to receive him. His troops and the dancing<br>women and all his subjects, also did the same. Surrounded by them all,<br>king Kusika, blazing with beauty and splendour, entered his city, with a<br>delighted heart, and his praises were hymned by bards and encomiasts.<br>Having entered his city and performed all his morning rites, he ate with<br>his wife. Endued with great splendour, the monarch then passed the night<br>happily. Each beheld the other to be possessed anew of youth. All their<br>afflictions and pains having ceased, they beheld each other to resemble a<br>celestial. Endued with the spendour they had obtained as a boon from that<br>foremost of Brahmanas, and possessed as they were of forms that were<br>exceedingly comely and beautiful, both of them passed a happy night in<br>their bed. Meanwhile, the spreader of the feats of Bhrigu's race, viz.,<br>the Rishi possessed of the wealth of penances, converted, by his<br>Yoga-power, that delightful wood on the bank of the Ganga into a retreat<br>full of wealth of every kind and adorned with every variety of jewels and<br>gems in consequence of which it surpassed in beauty and splendour the<br>very abode of the chief of the celestials."
