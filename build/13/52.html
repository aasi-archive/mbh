                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O thou of great wisdom, a doubt I have that is very<br>great and that is as vast as the ocean itself. Listen to it, O<br>mighty-armed one and having learnt what it is, it behoves thee to explain<br>it unto me. I have a great curiosity with respect to Jamadagni's son, O<br>lord, viz., Rama, that foremost of all righteous persons. It behoveth<br>thee to gratify that curiosity. How was Rama born who was endued with<br>prowess incapable of being baffled? He belonged by birth to a race of<br>regenerate Rishis. How did he become a follower of Kshatriya practices?<br>Do thou, then, O king, recite to me in detail the circumstances of Rama's<br>birth. How also did a son of the race of Kusika who was Kshatriya become<br>a Brahmana? Great, without doubt, was the puissance of the high-souled<br>Rama, O chief of men, as also of Viswamitra. Why did the grandson of<br>Richika instead of his son become a Kshatriya in conduct? Why also did<br>the grandson of Kusika and not his son become a Brahmana? Why did such<br>untoward incidents overtake the grandsons of both, instead of their sons?<br>It behoveth thee to explain the truth in respect of these circumstances.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited an old history of the<br>discourse between Chyavana and Kusika, O Bharata! Endued with great<br>intelligence, Chyavana of Bhrigu's race, that best of ascetics beheld<br>(with his spiritual eye) the stain that would affect his own race (in<br>consequence of some descendant of his becoming wedded to Kshatriya<br>practice). Reflecting upon the merits and faults of that incident, as<br>also its strength and weakness, Chyavana endued with wealth of asceticism<br>became desirous of consuming the race of the Kusikas (for it was from<br>that race that the stain of Kshatriya practices would, he knew, affect<br>his own race). Repairing then to the presence of king Kusika, Chyavana<br>said unto him, 'O sinless one, the desire has arisen in my heart of<br>dwelling with thee for some time.'<br><br>"Kusika said, 'O holy one, residence together is an act which the learned<br>ordain for girls when these are given away. They that are endued with<br>wisdom always speak of the practice in such connection only. O Rishi<br>endued with wealth of asceticism, the residence which thou seekest with<br>me is not sanctioned by the ordinance. Yet, however opposed to the<br>dictates of duty and righteousness, I shall do what thou mayst be pleased<br>to command.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Ordering a seat to be placed for the great ascetic<br>Chyavana, king Kusika, accompanied by his wife, stood in the presence of<br>the ascetic. Bringing a little jar of water, the king offered him water<br>for washing his feet. He then, through his, servants, caused all the<br>rites to be duly performed in honour of his high-souled guest. The<br>high-souled Kusika, who was observant of restraints and vows, then<br>cheerfully presented, according to due forms, the ingredients consisting<br>of honey and the other things, to the great Rishi and induced him to<br>accept the same. Having welcomed and honoured the learned Brahmana in<br>this way, the king once more addressed him and said, 'We two await thy<br>orders! Command us what we are to do for thee, O holy one! If it is our<br>kingdom or wealth or kine, O thou of rigid vows, or all articles that are<br>given away in sacrifices, which thou wantest, tell us the word, and we<br>shall bestow all upon thee! This palace, the kingdom, this seat of<br>justice, await thy pleasure. Thou art the lord of all these! Do thou rule<br>the earth! As regards myself, I am completely dependent upon thee.'<br>Addressed in these words by the king, Chyavana of Bhrigu's race, filled<br>with great delight, said unto Kusika these words in reply.'<br><br>"Chyavana said, 'I do not, O king, covet thy kingdom, nor thy wealth, nor<br>the damsels thou hast, nor thy kine, nor thy provinces, nor articles<br>needed for sacrifice. Do thou listen to me. If it pleases thee and thy<br>wife, I shall commence to observe a certain vow. I desire thee and thy<br>wife to serve me during that period without any scruples. Thus addressed<br>by the Rishi, the king and the queen became filled with joy, O Bharata,<br>and answered him, saving, 'Be it so, O Rishi!' Delighted with the Rishi's<br>words, the king led him into an apartment of the palace. It was an<br>excellent one, agreeable to see. The king showed him everything in that<br>room. And the king said. 'This, O holy one, is thy bed. Do thou live here<br>as thou pleasest! O thou that art endued with wealth of asceticism,<br>myself and my queen shall strive our best to give thee every comfort and<br>every pleasure.' While they were thus conversing with each other, the sun<br>passed the meridian. The Rishi commanded the king to bring him food and<br>drink, King Kusika, bowing unto the Rishi, asked him, saying, 'What kind<br>of food is agreeable to thee? What food, indeed, shall be brought for<br>thee?' Filled with delight, the Rishi answered that rule of men, O<br>Bharata, saying, 'Let food that is proper be given to me.' Receiving<br>these words with respect, the king said, 'So be it!' and then offered<br>unto the Rishi food of the proper kind. Having finished his meals, the<br>holy Chyavana, conversant with every duty, addressed the king and the<br>queen, saying, 'I desire to slumber. O puissant one, sleep hinders me<br>now.' Proceeding thence to a chamber that had been prepared for him, that<br>best of Rishis then laid himself down upon a bed. The king and the queen<br>sat themselves down. The Rishi said to them, 'Do not, while I sleep,<br>awake me. Do ye keep yourselves awake and continually press my feet as<br>long as I sleep.' Without the least scruple, Kusika, conversant with<br>every duty, said, 'So be it!' Indeed, the king and the queen kept<br>themselves awake all night, duly engaged in tending and serving the Rishi<br>in the manner directed. The royal couple, O monarch accomplished the<br>Rishi's bidding with earnestness and attention. Meanwhile the holy<br>Brahmana, having thus laid his commands upon the king, slept soundly,<br>without changing his posture or turning even once, for a space of one and<br>twenty days. The king, O delighter of the Kurus, foregoing all food,<br>along with his wife, sat joyfully the whole time engaged in tending and<br>serving the Rishi. On the expiration of one and twenty days, the son of<br>Bhrigu rose of his own accord. The great ascetic then went out of the<br>room, without accosting them at all. Famished and toil-worn the king and<br>the queen followed him, but that foremost of Rishis did not deign to cast<br>a single glance upon any of them. Proceeding a little way, the son of<br>Bhrigu disappeared in the very sight of the royal couple (making himself<br>invisible by his Yoga-power). At this, the king, struck with grief, fell<br>down on the earth. Comforted, he rose up soon, and accompanied by his<br>queen, the monarch, possessed of great splendour, began to search<br>everywhere for the Rishi.'
