                            "Vasishtha said, 'Kine are yielders of ghee and milk. They are the<br>sources of ghee and they have sprung from ghee. They are rivers of ghee,<br>and eddies of ghee. Let kine ever be in my house! Ghee is always my<br>heart. Ghee is even established in my navel. Ghee is in every limb of<br>mine. Ghee resides in my mind. Kine are always at my front. Kine are<br>always at my rear. Kine are on every side of my person. I live in the<br>midst of kine!&#8212;Having purified oneself by touching water, one should,<br>morning and evening, recite these Mantras every day. By this, one is sure<br>to be cleansed of all the sins one may commit in course of the day. They<br>who make gifts of a thousand kine, departing from this world, proceed to<br>the regions of the Gandharvas and the Apsaras where there are many<br>palatial mansions made of gold and where the celestial Ganga, called the<br>current of Vasu, runs. Givers of a thousand kine repair thither where run<br>many rivers having milk for their water, cheese for their mire, and curds<br>for their floating moss. That man who makes gifts of hundreds of<br>thousands of kine agreeably to the ritual laid down in the scriptures,<br>attains to high prosperity (here) and great honours in Heaven. Such a man<br>causes both his paternal and maternal ancestors to the tenth degree to<br>attain to regions of great felicity, and sanctifies his whole race. Kine<br>are sacred. They are the foremost of all things in the world. They are<br>verily the refuge of the universe. They are the mothers of the very<br>deities. They are verily incomparable. They should be dedicated in<br>sacrifices. When making journeys, one should proceed by their right<br>(i.e., keeping them to one's left). Ascertaining the proper time, they<br>should be given away unto eligible persons. By giving away a Kapila cow<br>having large horns, accompanied by a calf and a vessel of white brass for<br>milking her, and covered with a piece of cloth, one succeeds in entering,<br>freed from fear, the palace of Yama that is so difficult to enter. One<br>should always recite this sacred Mantra, viz.,&#8212;Kine are of beautiful<br>form. Kine are of diverse forms. They are of universal form. They are the<br>mothers of the universe. O, let kine approach me!&#8212;There is no gift more<br>sacred than the gift of kine. There is no gift that produces more blessed<br>merit. There has been nothing equal to the cow, nor will there be<br>anything that will equal her. With her skin, her hair, her horns, the<br>hair of her tail, her milk, and her fat,&#8212;with all these together,&#8212;the<br>cow upholds sacrifice. What thing is there that is more useful than the<br>cow? Bending my head unto her with reverence, I adore the cow who is the<br>mother of both the Past and the Future, and by whom the entire universe<br>of mobile and immobile creatures is covered. O best of men, I have thus<br>recited to thee only a portion of the high merits of kine. There is no<br>gift in this world that is superior to the gift of trine. There is also<br>no refuge in this world that is higher than kine.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'That high-souled giver of land (viz., king Saudasa),<br>thinking these words of the Rishi Vasishtha to be foremost in point of<br>importance, then made gifts of a very large number of kine unto the<br>Brahmanas, restraining his senses the while, and as the consequence of<br>those gifts, the monarch succeeded in attaining to many regions of<br>felicity in the next world.'"[378]
