                            "Yudhishthira said, 'People accept with affection the declarations of the<br>Srutis which say, 'This is to be given.' 'This other thing is to be<br>given!' As regards kings, again, they make gifts of various things unto<br>various men. What, however, O grandsire, is the best or foremost of all<br>gifts.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Of all kinds of gifts, the gift of earth has been said to<br>be the first (in point of merit). Earth is immovable and indestructible.<br>It is capable of yielding unto him who owns it all the best things upon<br>which his heart may be set. It yields robes and vestments, jewels and<br>gems, animals, paddy and barley. Amongst all creatures, the giver of<br>earth grows in prosperity for ever and ever. As long as the earth lasts,<br>so long does the giver thereof grow in prosperity. There is no gift that<br>is higher, O Yudhishthira, than the gift of earth. It hath been heard by<br>us that all men have given a little quantity of earth. All men have made<br>gifts of earth, hence all men enjoy a little of earth. Whether in this or<br>in the next world all creatures live under conditions dependent upon<br>their own acts. Earth is Prosperity's self. She is a mighty goddess. She<br>makes him her lord (in next life) who makes gifts of her in this life to<br>other people. That person, O best of kings, who gives away earth, which<br>is indestructible, as Dakshina, becomes born in next life as a man and<br>becomes also a lord of earth. The measure of one's enjoyment in this life<br>is commensurate with the measure of one's gifts in a previous life. Even<br>this is the conclusion to which the scriptures point. For a Kshatriya<br>should either give away the earth in gift or cast off his life in battle.<br>Even this constitutes the highest source of prosperity with regard to<br>Kshatriyas. It has been heard by us that earth, when given away, cleanses<br>and sanctifies the giver. The man that is of sinful behaviour, that is<br>guilty of even the slaughter of a Brahamana and of falsehood, is cleansed<br>by a gift of earth. Indeed, such a gift rescues even such a sinner from<br>all his sins. The righteous accept gifts of earth only and no other thing<br>from kings that are sinful. Like one's mother, earth, when given away,<br>cleanses the giver and the taker. This is an eternal and secret name of<br>earth, viz., Priyadatta.[328] Given away or accepted in gift, the name<br>that is dear to her is Priyadatta. The gift of earth is desirable. That<br>king who makes a gift of earth unto a learned Brahmana, obtains from that<br>gift a kingdom. Upon re-birth in this world, such a man without doubt<br>attains to a position that is equal to that of a king. Hence a king as<br>soon as he gets earth, should make gifts of earth unto the Brahmanas.<br>None but a lord of earth; is competent to make gifts of earth. Nor should<br>one that is not a deserving person accept a gift of earth. They who<br>desire earth should, without doubt, conduct themselves in this way (i.e.,<br>make gifts of earth). That person who takes away earth belonging to a<br>righteous person never gets any earth. By making gifts of earth unto the<br>righteous, one gets good earth. Of virtuous soul, such a giver acquires<br>great fame both here and hereafter. That righteous king respecting whom<br>the Brahmanas say, 'We live on earth given to us by him,' is such that<br>his very enemies cannot utter the least reproach respecting his<br>kingdom.[329] Whatever sins a man commits from want of the means of<br>support, are all washed off by gift of only so much earth as is covered<br>by a cow-hide. Those kings that are mean in their acts or are of fierce<br>deeds, should be taught that gift of earth is exceedingly cleansing and<br>is at the same time the highest gift (in respect of merit). The ancients<br>thought that there was always very little difference between the man who<br>performs a Horse-sacrifice and him that makes a gift of earth unto one<br>that is righteous. The learned doubt the acquisition of merit by doing<br>all other acts of righteousness. The only act with respect to which they<br>do not entertain doubt is the gift of earth which, indeed, is the<br>foremost of all gifts. The man of wisdom who makes gifts of earth, gives<br>away all these, viz., gold, silver, cloth, gems and pearls and precious<br>stones. Penances, sacrifice, Vedic lore, good behaviour, absence of<br>cupidity, firmness in truth, worship of seniors, preceptors, and the<br>deities&#8212;all these dwell in him who makes a gift of earth. They who<br>ascend to the region of Brahman by leaving off their lives in battle,<br>after having fought without any regard for themselves to secure the<br>benefit to their masters&#8212;even they are unable to transcend the merit of<br>those that make gilts of earth. As the mother always nourishes her own<br>child with milk from her breast, even so doth the earth gratify with all<br>the tastes the person that makes a gift of earth. Mrityu, Vaikinkara,<br>Danda, Yama, Fire who is possessed of great fierceness, and all heinous<br>and terrible sins are incapable of touching the person that makes a gift<br>of earth. That man of tranquil soul who makes a gift of earth gratifies<br>(by that act) the Pitris dwelling in their own region and the deities<br>also hailing from the region that is theirs. The man who makes a gift of<br>earth unto one that is emaciated and cheerless and destitute of the means<br>of life and languishing with weakness, and who thereby supplies one with<br>the means of subsistence, becomes entitled to the honour and merit of<br>performing a sacrifice. Even as an affectionate cow runs towards her<br>calf, with full udders dropping milk, the highly-blessed earth after the<br>same manner, runs towards the person who makes a gift of earth. That man<br>who makes unto a Brahmana a gift of earth which has been tilled, or sown<br>with seeds or which contains standing crops, or a mansion well-equipped<br>with every necessary, succeeds in becoming (in next life) the<br>accomplisher of the wishes of everybody. The man who causes a Brahmana<br>possessed of the means of life, owning a domestic fire and of pure vows<br>and practices, to accept a gift of earth, never falls into any danger or<br>distress. As the moon waxes day by day, even so the merit of a gift of<br>earth becomes enhanced every time such earth produces crops. Those<br>conversant with ancient history sing this verse in connection with the<br>gift of earth. Hearing that verse Jamadagni's son (Rama) gave away the<br>whole earth unto Kasyapa. The verse to which I refer is this, 'Receive me<br>in gift. Give me away. By giving me away, thou (O giver) shall obtain me<br>again!' That which is given away in this life is re-acquired in the<br>next.[330] That Brahmana who recites this high declaration of the Vedas<br>at the time of a Sraddha attains to the highest reward. A gift of earth<br>is a high expiation for the sin of those puissant men who betake<br>themselves to Atharvan rites for doing injuries to others. Indeed, by<br>making a gift of earth one rescues ten generations of one's paternal and<br>maternal race. That person who is even conversant with this Vedic<br>declaration respecting the merits of a gift of earth, succeeds in<br>rescuing ten generations of both his paternal and maternal families. The<br>earth is the original source of all creatures (for it is from earth that<br>all creatures derive their sustenance). It has been said that the deity<br>of fire is the presiding genius of the earth. After the coronation<br>ceremony has been performed of a king, this Vedic declaration should be<br>re-cited to him, so that he may make gifts of earth and may never take<br>away earth from a righteous person. Without doubt, the entire wealth<br>owned by the king belongs to the Brahmanas. A king well-conversant with<br>the science of duty and morality is the first requisite of the kingdom's<br>prosperity. Those people whose king is unrighteous and atheistic in<br>conduct and belief can never be happy. Such people can never sleep or<br>wake in peace. In consequence of his acts of wickedness his subjects<br>become always filled with anxiety. Protection of what the subjects<br>already have and new acquisitions according to lawful means are incidents<br>that are not noticeable in the kingdom of such a ruler. Those people,<br>again, who have a wise and righteous king, sleep happily and wake up in<br>happiness. Through the blessed and righteous acts of such a king, his<br>subjects become freed from anxiety. The subjects, restrained from wicked<br>acts, grow in prosperity through their own conduct. Capable of retaining<br>what they have, they go on making new acquisitions. That king who makes<br>gifts of earth is regarded as well-born. He is regarded as a man. He is a<br>friend. He is righteous in his acts. He is a giver. He is regarded as<br>possessing prowess. Those men who make gifts of ample and fertile earth<br>unto Brahmanas conversant with the Vedas, always shine in the world, in<br>consequence of their energy, like so many suns. As seeds scattered on the<br>soil grow and return a goodly crop, even so all one's wishes become<br>crowned with fruition in consequence of one's making gifts of earth.<br>Aditya and Varuna and Vishnu and Brahman and Soma and Hutasana, and the<br>illustrious and trident-bearing Mahadeva, all applaud the man that makes<br>a gift of earth. Living creatures spring into life from the earth and it<br>is into the earth that they become merged when they disappear. Living<br>creatures which are distributed into four classes (i.e., viviparous,<br>oviparous, filthborn, and vegetables) have earth for their constituent<br>essence. The earth is both the mother and father of the universe of<br>creatures, O monarch. There is no element, O ruler of men, that can<br>compare with earth. In this connection is cited the old narrative of a<br>discourse between the celestial preceptor Vrihaspati and Indra the ruler<br>of Heaven, O Yudhishthira. Having adored Vishnu in a hundred sacrifices<br>each of which was distinguished by plentiful gifts as Dakshina, Maghavat<br>put this question to Vrihaspati, that foremost of all eloquent persons.'<br><br>"Maghavat said, 'O illustrious one, by what gift does one succeed in<br>coming to Heaven and attaining to beatitude? O foremost of speakers, do<br>thou tell me of that gift which is productive of high and inexhaustible<br>merit.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by the chief of the celestials the<br>preceptor of the deities, viz., Vrihaspati of great energy, said these<br>words in reply unto him of a hundred sacrifices. Endued as he is with the<br>merits that attach to the gift of earth, the region of felicity reserved<br>for the person who makes gift of such earth as is auspicious and rich<br>with every taste, never become exhausted.[331] That king, O Sakra, who<br>desires to have prosperity and who wishes to win happiness for himself,<br>should always make gifts of earth, with due rites, unto deserving<br>persons. If after committing numerous sins a person makes gifts of earth<br>unto members of the regenerate class, he casts off all those sins like a<br>snake casting off its slough. The person that makes a gift of earth is<br>said to make gifts of everything, that is, of seas and rivers and<br>mountains and forests. By making a gift of earth, the person is said to<br>give away lakes and tanks and wells and streams. In consequence of the<br>moisture of earth, one is said to give away articles of diverse tastes by<br>making a gift of earth. The man who makes a gift of earth is regarded as<br>giving away herbs and plants possessed of high and efficacious virtues,<br>trees adorned with flowers and fruit, delightful woods, and hillocks. The<br>merit that a person acquires by making a gift of earth is incapable of<br>being acquired by the performance of even such great sacrifices as the<br>Agnishtoma and others with plentiful gifts in the shape of Dakshina. The<br>giver of earth, it has been already said, rescues ten generations of both<br>his paternal and maternal races. Similarly, by taking away earth that was<br>given away, one hurls oneself into hell and casts ten generations of both<br>one's paternal and maternal lines into the same place of misery. That man<br>who having promised to make a gift of earth does not actually make it, or<br>who having made a gift takes it back, has to pass a long time, in great<br>misery in consequence of being tied with the noose of Varuna at the<br>command of Death. Those men have never to go to Yama who honour and<br>worship those foremost of Brahmanas that pour libations every day on<br>their domestic fire, that are always engaged in the performance of<br>sacrifices, that have scanty means of livelihood, and that receive with<br>hospitality every guest seeking shelter in their abodes The king, O<br>Purandara, should free himself from the debt he owes to the Brahmanas and<br>protect the helpless and the weak belonging to the other orders. The king<br>should never resume, O chief of the deities, earth that has been given<br>away by another unto a Brahmana, O ruler of the celestials, that is<br>destitute of the means of life.[332] The tears that would fall from the<br>eyes of such cheerless and destitute Brahmanas in consequence of their<br>lands being taken back are capable of destroying the ancestors and<br>descendants to the third generation of the resumer. That man who succeeds<br>by his endeavours in re-establishing a king driven away from his kingdom,<br>obtains residence in heaven and is much honoured by the denizens thereof.<br>That king who succeeds in making gifts of earth with such crops standing<br>thereon as sugar-cane or barley or wheat, or with kine and horses and<br>other draft cattle,&#8212;earth that has been won with the might of the<br>giver's arms,&#8212;that has mineral wealth in its bowels and that is covered<br>with every kind of wealth of the surface, wins inexhaustible regions of<br>felicity in the next world, and such a king it is that is said to perform<br>the earth-sacrifice. That king who makes a gift of earth becomes washed<br>of every sin and is, therefore, pure and approved of the righteous. In<br>this world he is highly honoured and applauded by all righteous men. The<br>merit that attaches to a gift of earth increases every time the earth<br>given away bears crops for the benefit of the owner, even as a drop of<br>oil, falling upon water, is seen to extend on every side, and cover the<br>watery surface. Those heroic kings and ornaments of assemblies who cast<br>off their lives in battle with faces towards the foe, attain, O Sakra, to<br>the region of Brahman. Beautiful damsels skilled in music and dancing and<br>adorned with garlands of celestial flowers, approach, O chief of the<br>deities, the giver of earth as he comes to heaven departing from the<br>earth. That king who makes gifts of earth with due rites unto persons of<br>the regenerate order, sports in bliss in the celestial regions, adorned<br>all the while by the deities and Gandharvas. A century of Apsaras,<br>adorned with celestial garlands, approach, O chief of the deities, the<br>giver of earth as he ascends to the region of Brahman. Flowers of<br>excellent perfumes, an excellent conch and excellent seat, an umbrella<br>and excellent steeds with excellent vehicles, are always ready for the<br>person how makes gifts of earth. By making gifts of earth a king can<br>always command flowers of excellent perfumes and heaps of gold. Possessed<br>of all kinds of wealth the commands of such a king can never be disobeyed<br>anywhere, and cries of victory hail him wheresoever he may approach. The<br>rewards that attach to gifts of earth consist of residence in heaven, O<br>Purandara, and gold, and flowers, and plants and herbs of medicinal<br>virtue, and Kusa and mineral wealth and verdant grass. A person by making<br>a gift of earth acquires in his next life nectar yielding earth. There is<br>no gift that is equal to a gift of earth. There is no senior worthy of<br>greater respect than the mother. There is no duty higher than truth.<br>There is no wealth more precious than that which is given away.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Hearing these words from the son of Angiras, Vasava<br>made a gift unto him of the whole earth with all her jewels and gems and<br>all her wealth of diverse kinds. If these verses declaring the merit<br>attaching to gifts of earth be recited on the occasion of a Sraddha,<br>neither Rakshasas nor Asuras can succeed in appropriating any share of<br>the offerings made in it. Without doubt, the offerings one makes unto the<br>Pitris at such a Sraddha become inexhaustible. Hence, on occasions of<br>Sraddhas, the man of learning should recite these verses on the subject<br>of the merits that attach to gifts of earth, in the presence and hearing<br>of the invited Brahmanas when engaged in eating. I have thus, O chief of<br>the Bharatas, discoursed unto thee of that gift which is the foremost of<br>all gifts. What else dost thou wish to hear?'"
