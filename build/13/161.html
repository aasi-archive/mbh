                            "Vasudeva said, 'O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, listen to me as I recite to<br>thee the many names of Rudra as also the high blessedness of that<br>high-souled one. The Rishis describe Mahadeva as Agni, and Sthanu, and<br>Maheswara; as one-eyed, and three-eyed, of universal form, and Siva or<br>highly auspicious. Brahmanas conversant with the Vedas say that that god<br>has two forms. One of these is terrible, and the other mild and<br>auspicious. Those two forms, again, are subdivided into many forms. That<br>form which is fierce and terrible is regarded as identical with Agni and<br>Lightning and Surya. The other form which is mild and auspicious is<br>identical with Righteousness and water and Chandramas. Then, again, it is<br>said that half his body is fire and half is Soma (or the moon). That form<br>of his which is mild and auspicious is said to be engaged in the practice<br>of the Brahmacharya vow. The other form of his which is supremely<br>terrible is engaged in all operations of destruction in the universe.<br>Because he is great (Mahat) and the Supreme Lord of all (Iswara),<br>therefore he is called Maheswara. And since he burns and oppresses, is<br>keen and fierce, and endued with great energy, and is engaged in eating<br>flesh and blood and marrow, he is said to be Rudra. Since he is the<br>foremost of all the deities, and since his dominion and acquisitions are<br>very extensive, and since he protects the extensive universe, therefore<br>he is called Mahadeva. Since he is of the form or colour of smoke,<br>therefore he is called Dhurjati. Since by all his acts he performs<br>sacrifices for all and seeks the good of every creature, therefore he is<br>called Siva or the auspicious one. Staying above (in the sky) he burns<br>the lives of all creatures and is, besides, fixed in a particular route<br>from which he does not deviate. His emblem, again, is fixed and immovable<br>for all time. He is, for these reasons, called Sthanu. He is also of<br>multiform aspect. He is present, past, and future. He is mobile and<br>immobile. For this he is called Vahurupa (of multiform aspect). The<br>deities called Viswedevas reside in his body. He is, for this, called<br>Viswarupa (of universal form). He is thousand-eyed; or, he is<br>myriad-eyed; or, he has eyes on all sides and on every part of his body,<br>His energy issues through his eyes. There is no end of his eyes. Since he<br>always nourishes all creatures and sports also with them, and since he is<br>their lord or master, therefore he is called Pasupati (the lord of all<br>creatures). Since his emblem is always observant of the vow of<br>Brahmacharya, all the worlds worship it accordingly. This act of worship<br>is said to gratify him highly. If there is one who worship him by<br>creating his image, another who worships his emblem, the latter it is<br>that attains to great prosperity for ever. The Rishis, the deities, the<br>Gandharvas, and the Apsaras, worship that emblem of his which is ever<br>erect and upraised. If his emblem is worshipped, Maheswara becomes highly<br>gratified with the worshipper. Affectionate towards his devotees, he<br>bestows happiness upon them with a cheerful soul. This great god loves to<br>reside in crematoria and there he burns and consumes all corpses. Those<br>persons that perform sacrifices on such grounds attain at the end to<br>those regions which have been set apart for heroes. Employed in his<br>legitimate function, he it is That is regarded as the Death that resides<br>in the bodies of all creatures. He is, again, those breaths called Prana<br>and Apana in the bodies of all embodied beings. He has many blazing and<br>terrible forms. All those forms are worshipped in the world and are known<br>to Brahmanas possessed of knowledge. Amongst the gods he has many names<br>all of which are fraught with grave import. Verily, the meanings of those<br>names are derived from either his greatness or vastness, or his feats, or<br>his conduct. The Brahmanas always recite the excellent Sata-rudriya in<br>his honour, that occurs in the Vedas as also that which has been composed<br>by Vyasa. Verily, the Brahmanas and Rishis call him the eldest of all<br>beings. He is the first of all the deities, and it was from his mouth<br>that he created Agni. That righteous-souled deity, ever willing to grant<br>protection to all, never gives up his suppliants. He would much rather<br>abandon his own life-breaths and incur all possible afflictions himself.<br>Long life, health and freedom from disease, affluence, wealth, diverse<br>kinds of pleasures and enjoyments, are conferred by him, and it is he<br>also who snatches them away. The lordship and affluence that one sees in<br>Sakra and the other deities are, verily his. It is he who is always<br>engaged in all that is good and evil in the three worlds. In consequence<br>of his fullest control over all objects of enjoyment he is called Iswara<br>(the Supreme Lord or Master). Since, again, he is the master of the vast<br>universe, he is called Maheswara. The whole universe is pervaded by him<br>in diverse forms. It is that deity whose mouth roars and burns the waters<br>of the sea in the form of the huge mare's head!'"[618]
