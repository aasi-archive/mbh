                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Where do those foolish, wretched, and sinful men go,<br>O chief of men, that steal or misappropriate such articles as belong to<br>Brahmanas?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall, in this connection, O Bharata, recite to thee<br>the old narrative of a conversation between a Chandala and a low<br>Kshatriya.'[449]<br><br>"The person of the royal order said, 'Thou seemest, O Chandala, to be old<br>in years, but thy conduct seems to be like that of a boy! Thy body is<br>besmeared with the dust raised by dogs and asses, but without minding<br>that dust thou art anxious about the little drops of vine milk that have<br>fallen upon thy body! It is plain that such acts as are censured by the<br>pious are ordained for the Chandala. Why, indeed, dost thou seek to wash<br>off the spots of milk from thy body?'[450]<br><br>"The Chandala said, 'Formerly, O king, certain kine belonging to Brahmana<br>were stolen. While they were being carried away, some milk from their<br>udders fell upon a number of Soma plants that grew by the roadside. Those<br>Brahmanas that drank the juice of the plants thus bedewed with milk, as<br>also the king who performed the sacrifice in which that Soma was drunk,<br>had to sink in hell. Indeed, for having thus appropriated some thing that<br>had belonged to a Brahmana, the king with all the Brahmanas that had<br>assisted him had to go to hell. All those men also, Brahmanas and<br>Kshatriyas, that drank milk or ghee or curds, in the palace of the king<br>who had stolen the Brahmana's kine, had to fall into hell. The stolen<br>kine also, shaking their bodies, slew with their milk the sons and<br>grandsons of those that had stolen them, as also the king and the queen<br>although the latter treated the animals with great care and attention. As<br>regards myself, O king, I used to live in the observance of the vow of<br>Brahmacharya in that place where these kine were placed after they had<br>been stolen away. The food I had obtained by begging became sprinkled<br>over with the milk of those kine. Having taken that food, O thou of the<br>royal order, I have, in this life, become a Chandala. The king who had<br>stolen the kine belonging to a Brahmana obtained an infamous end. Hence,<br>one should never steal or appropriate anything that belongs to a<br>Brahmana. Behold to what state I am reduced in consequence of my having<br>eaten food that had been sprinkled over with milk belonging to a<br>Brahmana! It is for this reason that Soma plants become unsaleable by a<br>person possessed of wisdom. They who sell the Soma plant are censured by<br>the wise. Indeed, O son, they who purchase Soma and they who sell it,<br>both sink in the hell called Raurava when, departing from this world,<br>they repair to the region of Yama. That man who, possessing a knowledge<br>of the Vedas, duly sells Soma, becomes in his next life a usurer and<br>quickly meets with destruction. For three hundred times he has to sink<br>into hell and become transformed into an animal that subsists upon human<br>ordure. Serving a person that is vile and low, pride, and rape upon a<br>friend's wife, if weighed against one another in a balance, would show<br>that pride, which transcends all restraints, is the heaviest. Behold this<br>dog, so sinful and disagreeably pale and lean! (He was a human being in<br>his former life). It is through pride that living creatures attain to<br>such a miserable end. As regards myself, I was born in a large family, in<br>a former birth of mine. O lord, and I was a thorough master of all<br>branches of knowledge and all the sciences. I knew the gravity of all<br>these faults, but influenced by pride, I became blinded and ate the meat<br>attached to the vertebral columns of animals. In consequence of such<br>conduct and such food, I have come to this state. Behold the reverses<br>brought about by Time! Like a person whose cloth has taken fire at one<br>end, or who is pursued by bees, behold, I am running, penetrated with<br>fear, and smeared with dust! They that lead the domestic mode of life are<br>rescued from all sins by a study of the Vedas, as also by gifts of other<br>kinds, as declared by the wise.[451] O thou of the royal order, a<br>Brahmana that is sinful in conduct, becomes rescued from all his sins by<br>the study of the Vedas if he betakes himself to the forest mode of life<br>and abstains from attachment of every kind. O chief of Kshatriyas, I am<br>in this life, born in a sinful older! I fail to see clearly how I may<br>succeed in cleansing myself from all sins. In consequence of some<br>meritorious act of a former life, I have not lost the memory of my<br>previous lives. O king, I throw myself on the mercy! I ask thee! Do thou<br>resolve my doubt. By what auspicious course of conduct should I wish to<br>achieve my emancipation? O foremost of men, by what means shall I succeed<br>in getting rid of my status as a Chandala?'<br><br>"The person of the royal order said, 'Know, O Chandala, the means by<br>which thou mayst be able to attain to emancipation. By casting off thy<br>life-breaths for the sake of a Brahmana thou mayst attain a desirable<br>end! By throwing thy body on the fire of battle as a libation to the<br>beasts and birds of prey for the sake of a Brahmana, indeed, by casting<br>off thy life-breaths thus, thou mayst achieve emancipation! By no other<br>means wilt thou succeed in achieving it!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed, that Chandala, O scorcher of foes,<br>poured his life-breaths as a libation on the fire of battle for the sake<br>of protecting a Brahmana's wealth and as the consequence of that act<br>attained to a very desirable end. Hence, O son, thou shouldst always<br>protect the property of the Brahmanas, if, O chief of Bharata's race,<br>thou desirest, O thou of mighty arms, an end that is eternal felicity!'"
