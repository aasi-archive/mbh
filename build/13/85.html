                            'The Deities said, 'The Asura named Taraka who has received boons from<br>thee, O puissant one, is afflicting the deities and the Rishis. Let his<br>death be ordained by thee. O Grandsire, great has been our fear from him.<br>O illustrious one, do thou rescue us. We have no other refuge than thee.'<br><br>"Brahman said, 'I am equal in my behaviour towards all creatures. I<br>cannot, however, approve of unrighteousness. Let Taraka, that opponent of<br>the deities and Rishis, be quickly destroyed. The Vedas and the eternal<br>duties shall not be exterminated, ye foremost of celestials! I have<br>ordained what is proper in this matter. Let the fever of your hearts be<br>dispelled.'<br><br>"The Deities said, 'In consequence of thy having granted him boons, that<br>son of Diti has been proud of his might. He is incapable of being slain,<br>by the deities. How then will his death be brought about? The boon which,<br>O Grandsire, he has obtained from thee is that he should not be slayable<br>by deities or Asuras or Rakshasas. The deities have also been cursed by<br>the spouse of Rudra in consequence of their endeavour in former days to<br>stop propagation. The curse denounced by her has been, O lord of the<br>universe, even this, viz., that they are not to have any offspring.'<br><br>"Brahman said, 'Ye foremost of deities, Agni was not there at the time<br>the curse was denounced by the goddess. Even he will beget a son for the<br>destruction of the enemies of the gods. Transcending all the deities and<br>Danavas and Rakshasas and human beings and Gandharvas and Nagas and<br>feathery creatures, the offspring of Agni with his dart, which in his<br>hands will be a weapon incapable of being baffled if once hurled at the<br>foe, will destroy Taraka from whom your fear hath arisen. Verily, all<br>other enemies of yours will also be slain by him. Will is eternal. That<br>Will is known by the name of Kama and is identical with Rudra's seed a<br>portion of which fell into the blazing form of Agni. That energy, which<br>is a mighty substance, and which resembles a second Agni, will be cast by<br>Agni into Ganga for producing a child upon her in order to effect the<br>destruction of the enemies of the gods. Agni did not come within the<br>range of Uma's curse. The eater of sacrificial libations was not present<br>there when the curse was denounced. Let the deity of fire, therefore, be<br>searched out. Let him now be set to this task. Ye sinless ones, I have<br>told you what the means are for the destruction of Taraka. The curses of<br>those that are endued with energy fail to produce any effect upon those<br>that are endued with energy. Forces, when they come into contact with<br>something that is endued with stronger force, become weakened. They that<br>are endued with penances are competent to destroy even the boon-giving<br>deities who are indestructible. Will, or Like, or Desire (which is<br>identifiable with Agni) sprang in former times and is the most eternal of<br>all creatures. Agni is the Lord of the universe. He is incapable of being<br>apprehended or described. Capable of going everywhere and existing in all<br>things, he is the Creator of all beings. He lives in the hearts of all<br>creatures. Endued with great puissance, He is older than Rudra himself.<br>Let that eater of sacrificial libations, who is a mass of energy, be<br>searched out. That illustrious deity will accomplish this desire of your<br>hearts.' Hearing these words of the Grandsire, the high-souled gods then<br>proceeded to search out the god of fire with hearts cheerful in<br>consequence of their purpose having been achieved. The gods and the<br>Rishis then searched every part of the three worlds, their hearts filled<br>with the thought of Agni and eagerly desiring to obtain a sight of him.<br>Endued with penances, possessed of prosperity, celebrated over all the<br>worlds, those high-souled ones, all crowned with ascetic success,<br>sojourned over every part of the universe, O foremost one of Bhrigu's<br>race. They failed, however, to find out the eater of sacrificial<br>libations who had concealed himself by merging his self into self.[384]<br>About this time, a frog, living in water, appeared on the surface thereof<br>from the nethermost regions, with cheerless heart in consequence of<br>having been scorched by the energy of Agni. The little creature addressed<br>the deities who had become penetrated with fear and who were all very<br>eager to obtain a sight of the deity of fire, saying, 'Ye gods, Agni is<br>now residing in the nethermost regions. Scorched by the energy of that<br>deity, and unable to bear it longer, I have come hither. The illustrious<br>bearer of sacrificial libations, ye gods, is now under the waters. He has<br>created a mass of waters within which he is staying. All of us have been<br>scorched by his energy. If, ye gods, ye desire to obtain a sight of<br>him,&#8212;verily, if ye have any business with him,&#8212;do ye go to him thither.<br>Do, indeed, repair thither. As regards ourselves, we shall fly from this<br>place, ye deities, from fear of Agni.' Having said this much, the frog<br>dived into the water'. The eater of sacrificial libations learnt of the<br>treachery of the frog. Coming to that animal, he cursed the whole<br>batrachian race, saying, 'Ye shall henceforth be deprived of the organ of<br>taste. Having denounced this curse on the frog, he left the spot speedily<br>for taking up his abode elsewhere. Verily, the puissant deity did not<br>show himself. Seeing the plight to which the frogs were reduced for<br>having done them a service, the deities, O best of the Bhrigus, showed<br>favour unto those creatures. I shall tell thee everything regarding it.<br>Do thou listen to me, O mighty-armed hero.'<br><br>"The Deities said, 'Though deprived of tongues through the curse of Agni<br>and, therefore, reft of the sensation of taste, ye shall yet be able to<br>utter diverse kinds of speech. Living within holes, deprived of food,<br>reft of consciousness, wasted and dried up, and more dead than alive, all<br>of you will be held by the Earth nevertheless. Ye shall also be able to<br>wander about at night-time when everything is enveloped in thick<br>darkness.' Having said this unto the frogs, the deities once more went<br>over every part of the earth for finding out the deity of blazing flames.<br>In spite of all their efforts, however, they failed to get at him. Then,<br>O perpetuator of Bhrigu's race, an elephant, as large and mighty as the<br>elephant of Sakra, addressed the gods, saying, 'Agni is now residing<br>within this Aswattha tree!' Incensed with wrath, Agni cursed all the<br>elephants, O descendant of Bhrigu saying, 'Your tongues will be bent<br>back.' Having been pointed out by the elephants, the deity of fire cursed<br>all elephants even thus and then went away and entered the heart of the<br>Sami tree from the desire of residing within it for some time. Listen<br>now, O puissant hero, what favour was shown unto the elephants, O<br>foremost one of Bhrigu's race, by the deities of unbaffled prowess who<br>were all gratified with the service a representative of their had done<br>them.'<br><br>"The Deities said, 'With the aid of even your tongues bent inwards ye<br>shall be able to eat all things, and with even those tongues ye shall be<br>able to utter cries that will only be indistinct. Having blessed the<br>elephants in this way, the denizens of Heaven once more resumed their<br>search after Agni. Indeed, having issued out of the Aswattha tree, the<br>deity of fire had entered the heart of Sami. This new abode of Agni was<br>divulged by a parrot. The gods thereupon proceeded to the spot. Enraged<br>with the conduct of the parrot, the deity of blazing flames cursed the<br>whole parrot race, saying, 'Ye shall from this day be deprived of the<br>power of speech.' Indeed, the eater of sacrificial libations turned up<br>the tongues of all the parrots. Beholding Agni at the place pointed out<br>by the parrot, and witnessing the curse denounced upon him, the gods,<br>feeling a compassion for the poor creature, blessed him, saying, 'In<br>consequence of thy being a parrot, thou shalt not be wholly deprived of<br>the power of speech. Though thy tongue has been turned backwards, yet<br>speech thou shalt have, confined to the letter K. Like that of a child or<br>an old man, thy speech shall be sweet and indistinct and wonderful.'<br>Having said these words unto the parrot, and beholding the deity of fire<br>within the heart of the Sami, the gods made Sami wood a sacred fuel fit<br>for producing fire in all religious rites. It was from that time that<br>fire is seen to reside in the heart of the Sami. Men came to regard the<br>Sami as proper means for producing fire (in sacrifice).[385] The waters<br>that occur in the nethermost regions had come into contact with the deity<br>of blazing flames. Those heated waters, O thou of Bhrigu's race, are<br>vomited forth by the mountain springs. In consequence, indeed, of Agni<br>having resided in them for some time, they became hot through his energy.<br>Meanwhile, Agni, beholding the gods, became grieved. Addressing the<br>deities, he asked them, 'What is the reason of your presence here?' Unto<br>him the deities and the great Rishi said, 'We wish to set thee to a<br>particular task. It behoveth thee to accomplish it. When accomplished, it<br>will redound greatly to thy credit.'<br><br>"Agni said, 'Tell me what your business is. I shall, ye gods, accomplish<br>it. I am always willing to be set by you to any task you wish. Do not<br>scruple, therefore, to command me.'"<br><br>"The Deities said, 'There is an Asura of the name of Taraka who has been<br>filled with pride in consequence of the boon he has obtained from<br>Brahman. Through his energy he is able to oppose and discomfit us. Do<br>thou ordain his destruction. O sire, do thou rescue these deities, these<br>Prajapatis, and these Rishis, O highly blessed Pavaka! O puissant one, do<br>thou beget a heroic son possessed of thy energy, who will dispel, O<br>bearer of sacrificial libations, our fears from that Asura. We have been<br>cursed by the great goddess Uma. There is nothing else then thy energy<br>which can be our refuge now. Do thou, therefore, O puissant deity, rescue<br>us all.' Thus addressed, the illustrious and irresistible bearer of<br>sacrificial libations answered, saying, 'Be it so', and he than proceeded<br>towards Ganga otherwise called Bhagirathi. He united himself in<br>(spiritual) congress with her and caused her to conceive. Verily, in the<br>womb of Ganga the seed of Agni began to grow even as Agni himself grows<br>(when supplied with fuel and aided by the wind). With the energy of that<br>god, Ganga became exceedingly agitated at heart. Indeed, she suffered<br>great distress and became unable to bear it. When the deity of blazing<br>flames cast his seed endued with great energy into the womb of Ganga, a<br>certain Asura (bent on purposes of his own) uttered a frightful roar. In<br>consequence of that frightful roar uttered by the Asura for purposes of<br>his own (and not for terrifying her), Ganga became very much terrified<br>and her eyes rolled in fear and betrayed her agitation. Deprived of<br>consciousness, she became unable to bear her body and the seed within her<br>womb. The daughter of Jahnu, inseminated with the energy of the<br>illustrious deity, began to tremble. Overwhelmed with the energy of the<br>seed she held in her womb, O learned Brahmana, she then addressed the<br>deity of blazing fire, saying, 'I am no longer capable, O illustrious<br>one, of bearing thy seed in my womb. Verily, I am overcome with weakness<br>by this seed of thine. The health I had in days before is no longer mine.<br>I have been exceedingly agitated, O illustrious one, and my heart is dead<br>within me, O sinless one. O foremost of all persons endued with penances,<br>I am in capable of bearing thy seed any longer. I shall cast it off,<br>compelled by the distress that has overtaken me, and not by caprice.<br>There has been no actual contact of my person with thy seed, O<br>illustrious deity of blazing flames! Our union, having for its cause the<br>distress that has overtaken the deities, has been suitable and not of the<br>flesh, O thou of great splendour. Whatever merit or otherwise there may<br>be in this act (intended to be done by me), O eater of sacrificial<br>libations, must belong to thee. Verily, I think, the righteousness or<br>unrighteousness of this deed must be thine.' Unto her the deity of fire<br>said, 'Do thou bear the seed. Do, indeed, bear the foetus endued with my<br>energy. It will lead to great results. Thou art, verily, capable of<br>bearing the entire earth. Thou wilt gain nothing by not holding this<br>energy.' That foremost of streams, though thus passed by the deity of<br>fire as also by all the other deities, cast off the seed on the breast of<br>Meru, that foremost of all mountains. Capable (somehow) of bearing that<br>seed, yet oppressed by the energy of Rudra (for Agni is identical with<br>Rudra), she failed to hold that seed longer in consequence of its burning<br>energy. After she had cast it off, through sheer distress, that blazing<br>seed having the splendour of fire, O perpetuator of Bhrigu's race, Agni<br>saw her, and asked that foremost of streams, 'Is it all right with the<br>foetus thou hast cast off? Of what complexion has it been, O goddess? Of<br>what form does it look? With what energy does it seem to be endued? Do<br>thou tell me all about it.'<br><br>"Ganga said, 'The foetus is endued with the complexion of gold. In energy<br>it is even like thee, O sinless one! Of an excellent complexion,<br>perfectly stainless, and blazing with splendour, it has illuminated the<br>entire mountain. O foremost of all persons endued with penances, the<br>fragrance emitted by it resembles the cool perfume that its scattered by<br>lakes adorned with lotuses and Nyphoea stellata, mixed with that of the<br>Nauclea Cadamba. With the splendour of that foetus everything around it<br>seemed to be transformed into gold even as all things on mountain and low<br>land seem to be transformed into gold by the rays of the Sun. Indeed, the<br>splendour of that foetus, spreading far, falls upon mountains and rivers<br>and springs. Indeed, it seems that the three worlds, with all their<br>mobile and immobile creatures, are being illuminated by it. Even of this<br>kind is thy child, O illustrious bearer of sacrificial libations. Like<br>unto Surya or thy blazing self, in beauty it is even like a second Soma.'<br>Having said these words, the goddess disappeared there and then. Pavaka<br>also, of great energy, having accomplished the business of the deities<br>proceeded to the place he liked, O delighter of the Bhrigus. It was in<br>consequence of the result of this act that the Rishis and the deities<br>bestowed the name of Hiranyaretas upon the deity of fire.[386] And<br>because the Earth held that seed (after the goddess Ganga had cast it<br>upon her), she also came to be called by the name of Vasumati. Meanwhile;<br>that foetus, which had sprung from Pavaka and been held for a time by<br>Ganga,[387] having fallen on a forest of reeds, began to grow and at last<br>assumed a wonderful form. The presiding goddess of the constellation<br>Krittika beheld that form resembling the rising sun. She thenceforth<br>began to rear that child as her son with the sustenance of her breast.<br>For this reason, that child of pre-eminent splendour came to be called<br>Kartikeya after her name. And because he grew from seed that fell out of<br>Rudra's body, he came to be called Skanda. The incident also of his birth<br>having taken place in the solitude of a forest of reeds, concealed from<br>everybody's view, led to his being called by the name of Guha. It was in<br>this way that gold came into existence as the offspring of the deity of<br>blazing flames.[388] Hence it is that gold came to be looked upon as the<br>foremost of all things and the ornament of the very gods. It was from<br>this circumstance that gold came to be called by the name of<br>Jatarupam.[389] It is the foremost of all costly things, and among<br>ornaments also it is the foremost. The cleanser among all cleansing<br>things, it is the most auspicious of all auspicious objects. Gold is<br>truly the illustrious Agni. the Lord of all things, and the foremost of<br>all Prajapatis. The most sacred of all sacred things is gold, O foremost<br>of re-generate ones. Verily, gold is said to have for its essence Agni<br>and Soma.'<br><br>"Vasishtha continued, 'This history also, O Rama, called Brahmadarsana,<br>was heard by me in days of yore, respecting the achievement of the<br>Grandsire Brahman who is identifiable with the Supreme Soul. To a<br>sacrifice performed in days of yore by that foremost of gods, viz., Lord<br>Rudra, O thou of great might, who on that occasion had assumed the form<br>of Varuna, there came the Munis and all the deities with Agni at their<br>head. To that sacrifice also came all the sacrificial limbs (in their<br>embodied forms), and the Mantra called Vashat in his embodied form. All<br>the Samans also and all the Yajushes, numbering by thousands and in their<br>embodied forms, came there. The Rig-Veda also came there, adorned with<br>the rules of orthoepy. The Lakshanas, the Suras, the Niruktas, the Notes<br>arranged in rows, and the syllable Om, as also Nigraha and Pragraha, all<br>came there and took their residence in the eye of Mahadeva. The Vedas<br>with the Upanishads, Vidya and Savitri, as also, the Past, the Present,<br>and the Future, all came there and were held by the illustrious Siva. The<br>puissant Lord of all then poured libations himself into his own self.<br>Indeed, the wielder of Pinaka caused that Sacrifice of multifarious form<br>to look exceedingly beautiful. He is Heaven, Firmament, Earth, and the<br>Welkin. He is called the Lord of the Earth. He is the Lord whose sway is<br>owned by all obstacles. He is endued with Sri and He is identical with<br>the deity of blazing flames. That illustrious deity is called by various<br>names. Even He is Brahman and Siva and Rudra and Varuna and Agni and<br>Prajapati. He is the auspicious Lord of all creatures. Sacrifice (in his<br>embodied form), and Penance, and all the union rites, and the goddess<br>Diksha blazing with rigid observances, the several points of the compass<br>with the deities that respectively preside over them, the spouses of all<br>the deities, their daughters, and the celestial mothers, all came<br>together in a body to Pasupati, O perpetuator of Bhrigu's race. Verily,<br>beholding that sacrifice of the high-souled Mahadeva who had assumed the<br>form of Varuna, all of them became highly pleased. Seeing the celestial<br>damsels of great beauty, the seed of Brahman came out and fell upon the<br>earth. In consequence of the seed having fallen on the dust, Pushan<br>(Surya) took up that dust mixed with the particles of seed from the earth<br>with his hands and cast it into the sacrificial fire. Meanwhile, the<br>sacrifice with the sacred fire of blazing flames was commenced and it<br>went on. Brahman (as the Hotri) was pouring libations on the fire. While<br>thus employed, the grandsire became excited with desire (and his seed<br>came out). As soon as that seed came out, he took it up with the<br>sacrificial ladle and poured it as a libation of ghee, O delighter of the<br>Bhrigus, with the necessary Mantras, on the blazing fire. From that seed,<br>Brahman of great energy caused the four orders of creatures to spring<br>into existence. That seed of the Grandsire was endued with the three<br>attributes of Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas. From that element in it which<br>represented the principle of Rajas, sprang all mobile creatures endued<br>with the principle of Pravritti or action.[390] From the element of Tamas<br>in it, sprang all immobile creatures. The principle of Sattwa, however,<br>which dwelt in that seed, entered both kinds of existences. That<br>attribute of Sattwa is of the nature of Tejas or Light (being identical<br>with Buddhi or the Understanding). It is eternal and of it is unending<br>Space.[391] In all creatures the attribute of Sattwa is present and is<br>identical with that light which shows what is right and what is wrong.<br>When the seed of Brahman was thus poured as a libation on that<br>sacrificial fire, there sprang from it, O mighty one, three beings into<br>existence. They were three male persons, endued with bodies that partook<br>of the characters of the circumstances from which they respectively<br>sprang. One arose first from the flames of the fire (called Bhrig) and<br>hence he came to be called by the name of Bhrigu. A second came from the<br>burning charcoals (called Angara) and hence he came to be called by the<br>name of Angiras. The third sprang from a heap of extinguished charcoals<br>and he came to be called by the name of Kavi. It has been already said<br>that the first came out with flames emanating from his body and hence he<br>was called Bhrigu. From the rays of the sacrificial fire sprang another<br>called Marichi. From Marichi (afterwards) sprang Kasyapa. It has been<br>already said that from the (burning) charcoals sprang Angiras. The<br>(diminutive) Rishis called Valakhilyas sprang from the blades of Kusa<br>grass spread out in that sacrifice. From the same blades of Kula grass, O<br>thou of great puissance, sprang Atri. From the ashes of the fire sprang<br>all those that are numbered among the regenerate Rishis, viz., the<br>Vaikhanasas, endued with penances and devoted to Vedic lore and all<br>excellent accomplishments. From the eyes of Agni sprang the twin Aswins<br>endued with great beauty of person. At last, from his ears, sprang all<br>the Prajapatis. The Rishis sprang from the pores of Agni's body. From his<br>sweat sprang Chhandas, and from his strength sprang Mind. For this<br>reason, Agni has been said to be all the deities in his individual self,<br>by Rishis endued with Vedic lore, guided by the authority of the Vedas.<br>The pieces of wood that keep alive the flames of Agni are regarded as the<br>Months. The Juices that the fuel yields constitute the Fortnights. The<br>liver of Agni is called the Day and Night, and his fierce light is called<br>the Muhurtas. The blood of Agni is regarded as the source of the Rudras.<br>From his blood sprang also the gold-complexioned deities called the<br>Maitradevatas. From his smoke sprang the Vasus. From his flames sprang<br>the Rudras as also the (twelve) Adityas of great effulgence. The Planets<br>and Constellations and other stars that have been set in their respective<br>orbits in the firmament, are regarded as the (burning) charcoals of Agni.<br>The first Creator of the universe declared Agni to be Supreme Brahma and<br>Eternal, and the giver of all wishes. This is verily a mystery.<br><br>"After all these births had taken place, Mahadeva who had assumed the<br>form of Varuna (for his sacrifice) and who had Pavana for his soul, said,<br>'This excellent Sacrifice is mine. I am the Grahapati in it. The there<br>beings that first sprang from the sacrificial fire are mine. Without<br>doubt, they should be regarded as my offspring. Know this, ye gods who<br>range through the skies! They are the fruits of this Sacrifice.'"<br><br>"Agni said, 'These offspring have sprung from my limbs. They have all<br>depended upon me as the cause of their starting into life. They should,<br>therefore, be regarded, as my children. Mahadeva in the form of Varuna is<br>in error in respect of this matter.[392] After this, the master of all<br>the worlds, the Grandsire of all creatures, viz., Brahman, then said,<br>'These children are mine. The seed was mine which I poured upon the<br>sacrificial fire. I am the accomplisher of this Sacrifice. It was I who<br>poured on the sacrificial fire the seed that came out of myself. The<br>fruit is always his who has planted the seed. The principal cause of<br>these births is the seed owned by me.' The deities then repaired to the<br>presence of the Grandsire and having bowed their heads unto him joined<br>their hands in reverence and they said unto him, "All of us, O<br>illustrious one, and the entire universe of mobile and immobile<br>creatures, are thy offspring. O sire, let Agni of blazing flames, and the<br>illustrious and puissant Mahadeva who has, for this sacrifice, assumed<br>the form of Varuna, have their wish (in the matter of the offspring).' At<br>these words, although born of Brahman, the puissant Mahadeva in the form<br>of Varuna, the ruler of all aquatic creatures received the firstborn one,<br>viz., Bhrigu endued with the effulgence of the sun as his own child. The<br>Grandsire then intended that Angiras should become the son of Agni.<br>Conversant with the truth in respect of everything, the Grandsire then<br>took Kavi as his own son. Engaged in procreating creatures for peopling<br>the earth, Bhrigu who is regarded as a Prajapati thence came to be called<br>as Varuna's offspring. Endued with every prosperity, Angiras came to be<br>called the offspring of Agni, and the celebrated Kavi came to be known as<br>the child of Brahman himself. Bhrigu and Angiras who had sprung from the<br>flame and the charcoals of Agni respectively, became the procreators of<br>extensive races and tribes in the world. Verily, these three, viz.,<br>Bhrigu and Angiras and Kavi, regarded as Prajapati, are the progenitors<br>of many races and tribes. All are the children of these three. Know this,<br>O puissant hero. Bhrigu begot seven sorts all of whom became equal to him<br>in merits and accomplishments. Their names are Chyavana, Vajrasirsha,<br>Suchi, Urva, Sukra, that giver of boons, Vibhu, and Savana. These are the<br>seven. They are children of Bhrigu and are hence Bhargavas. They are also<br>called Varunas in consequence of their ancestor Bhrigu having been<br>adopted by Mahadeva in the form of Varuna. Thou belongest to the race of<br>Bhrigu. Angiras begot eight sons. They also are known as Varunas. Their<br>names are Vrihaspati, Utathya, Payasya, Santi, Dhira, Virupa, Samvarta,<br>and Sudhan was the eighth. These eight are regarded also as the offspring<br>of Agni. Freed from every evil, they are devoted to knowledge only. The<br>sons of Kavi who was appropriated by Brahman himself are also known as<br>Varunas. Numbering eight, all of them became progenitors of races and<br>tribes. Auspicious by nature, they are all conversant with Brahma. The<br>names of the eight sons of Kavi are Kavi, Kavya, Dhrishnu, Usanas endued<br>with great intelligence, Bhrigu, Viraja, Kasi, and Ugra conversant with<br>every duty. These are the eight sons of Kavi. By them the whole world has<br>been peopled. They are all Prajapatis, and by them have been procreated<br>many offspring. Thus, O chief of Bhrigu's race, hath the whole world been<br>peopled with the progeny of Angiras, and Kavi and Bhrigu. The puissant<br>and supreme Lord Mahadeva in the form of Varuna which he had assumed for<br>his sacrifice had first, O learned Brahmana, adopted both Kavi and<br>Angiras. Hence, these two are regarded as of Varuna. After that the eater<br>of sacrificial libations, viz., the deity of blazing flames, adopted<br>Angiras. Hence, all the progeny of Angiras are known as belonging to the<br>race of Agni. The Grandsire Brahman was, in olden days, gratified by all<br>the deities who said unto him, 'Let these lords of the universe<br>(referring to Bhrigu and Angiras and Kavi and their descendants) rescue<br>us all. Let all of them become progenitors of offspring (for peopling the<br>earth). Let all of them become endued with penances. Through thy grace,<br>let all these rescue the world (from becoming an uninhabited wilderness).<br>Let them become procreators and extenders of races and tribes and let<br>them increase thy energy. Let all of them become thorough masters of the<br>Vedas and let them be achievers of great deeds. Let all of them be<br>friends to the cause of the deities. Indeed, let all of them become<br>endued with auspiciousness. Let them become founders of extensive races<br>and tribes and let them be great Rishis. Let all of them be endued with<br>high penances and let all of them be devoted to high Brahmacharya, All of<br>us, as also all these are thy progeny, O thou of great puissance. Thou, O<br>Grandsire, art the Creator of both, deities and the Brahmanas. Marichi is<br>thy first son. All these also that are called Bhargavas are thy progeny.<br>(Ourselves also are so). Looking at this fact, O Grandsire, we shall all<br>aid and support one another. All these shall, in this way, multiply their<br>progeny and establish thyself at the commencement of each creation after<br>the universal destruction.' Thus addressed by them, Brahman, the<br>Grandsire of all the worlds, said unto them, 'So be it! I am gratified<br>with you all! Having said so unto the deities he proceeded to the place<br>he had come from. Even this is what happened in days of old in that<br>sacrifice of the high-souled Mahadeva, that foremost one of all the<br>deities, in the beginning of creation, when he for the purposes of his<br>sacrifice had assumed the form of Varuna. Agni is Brahman. He is<br>Pasupati. He is Sarva. He is Rudra. He is Prajapati.[393] It is<br>well-known that gold is the offspring of Agni. When fire is not<br>obtainable (for the purposes of a sacrifice), gold is used as substitute.<br>Guided by the indications afforded by the auditions of the Veda, one that<br>is conversant with authorities and that knows the identity of gold with<br>fire, acts in this way. Placing a piece of gold on some blades of Kusa<br>grass spread out on the ground, the sacrificer pours libations upon it.<br>Upon also the pores of an ant-hill, upon the right ear of a goat, upon a<br>piece of level earth, upon the waters of a Tirtha, or on the hand of a<br>Brahmana, if libations are poured, the illustrious deity of fire becomes<br>gratified and regards It as a source of his own aggrandisement as also<br>that of the deities through his. Hence, it is that we have heard that all<br>the deities regard Agni as their refuse and are devoted to him. Agni<br>sprang from Brahman, and from Agni sprang gold.[394] Hence, it has been<br>heard by us, that those persons observant of righteousness that make<br>gifts of gold are regarded as giving away all the deities. The man who<br>makes gifts of gold attains to a very high end. Regions of blazing<br>effulgence are his. Verily, O Bhargava, he becomes installed as the king<br>of kings in heaven. That person who, at sunrise, makes a gift of gold<br>according to the ordinance and with proper Mantras, succeeds in warding<br>off the evil consequences foreshadowed by ominous dreams. The man who, as<br>soon as the sun has risen, makes a gift of gold becomes cleansed of all<br>his sins. He who makes a gift of gold at midday destroys all his future<br>sins. He who with restrained soul, makes a gift of gold at the second<br>twilight succeeds in attaining to a residence with Brahman and the deity<br>of wind and Agni and Soma in their respective regions. Such a man attains<br>to auspicious fame in regions of great felicity that belong to Indra<br>himself. Attaining to great fame in this world also, and cleansed of all<br>his sins, he sports in joy and happiness. Verily, such a man attains to<br>many other regions of happiness and becomes unequalled for glory and<br>fame. His course perfectly unobstructed, he succeeds in going everywhere<br>at will. He has never to fall down from the regions to which he attains<br>and the glory he acquires becomes great. Indeed, by making gifts of gold<br>one attains to innumerable regions of felicity all of which he enjoys for<br>eternity. That man who, having ignited a fire at sunrise, makes gifts of<br>gold in view of the observance of a particular vow, succeeds in attaining<br>to the fruition of all his wishes. It has been said that gold is<br>identical with Agni. The gift of gold, therefore, is productive of great<br>felicity. The gift of gold leads to the possession of those merits and<br>accomplishments that are desired, and cleanses the heart.[395] I have<br>thus told thee, O sinless one, the origin of gold. O thou of puissance,<br>hear how Kartikeya grew up, O delighter of Bhrigu's race. After a long<br>time Kartikeya grew up. He was then, O perpetuator of Bhrigu's race,<br>chosen by all the deities with Indra at their head, as the generalissimo<br>of the celestial forces. He slew the Daitya Taraka as also many other<br>Asuras, at the command of the chief of the celestials, O Brahmana, and<br>actuated also by the desire of benefiting all the worlds. I have also, O<br>thou of great might, discoursed to thee on the merits of making gifts of<br>gold. Do thou, therefore, O foremost of all speakers make gifts of gold.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by Vasishtha, Jamadagni's son of<br>great prowess then made gifts of gold unto the Brahmanas and became<br>cleansed of his sins. I have thus told thee, O king, everything about the<br>merits of the gifts of gold and about its origin also, O Yudhishthira. Do<br>thou also, therefore, make abundant gifts of gold unto the Brahmanas.<br>Verily, O king, by making such gifts of gold, thou wilt surely be<br>cleansed of all thy sins!'"
