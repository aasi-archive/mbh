                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having said so unto all the Kurus, Bhishma, the son<br>of Santanu, remained silent for sometime, O chastiser of foes He then<br>held forth his life-breaths successively in those parts of his body which<br>are indicated in Yoga. The life-breaths of that high-souled one,<br>restrained duly, then rose up. Those parts of the body of Santanu's son,<br>in consequence of the adoption, of Yoga, from which the life-breaths went<br>up, became soreless one after another. In the midst of those high-souled<br>persons, including those great Rishis with Vyasa at their head, the sight<br>seemed to be a strange one, O king. Within a short time, the entire body<br>of Bhishma became shaftless and soreless. Beholding it, all those<br>distinguished personages with Vasudeva at their head, and all the<br>ascetics with Vyasa, became filled with wonder. The life-breaths,<br>restrained and unable to escape through any of the outlets, at last<br>pierced through the crown of the head and proceeded upwards to heaven.<br>The celestial kettle-drums began to play and floral showers were rained<br>down. The Siddhas and regenerate Rishis, filled with delight, exclaimed,<br>'Excellent, Excellent!' 'The life-breaths of Bhishma, piercing through<br>the crown of his head, shot up through the welkin like a large meteor and<br>soon became invisible. Even thus, O great king, did Santanu's son, that<br>pillar of Bharata's race, united himself with eternity. Then the<br>high-souled Pandavas and Vidura, taking a large quantity of wood and<br>diverse kinds of fragrant scents, made a funeral pyre. Yuyutsu and others<br>stood as spectators of the preparations. Then Yudhishthira and the<br>high-souled Vidura wrapped Bhishma's body with silken cloth and floral<br>garlands. Yuyutsu held an excellent umbrella, over it Bhimasena and<br>Arjuna both held in their hands a couple of yak-tails of pure white. The<br>two sons of Madri held two head-gears in their hands. Yudhishthira and<br>Dhritarashtra stood at the feet of the lord of the Kurus, taking up<br>palmyra fans, stood around the body and began to fan it softly. The Pitri<br>sacrifice of the high-souled Bhishma was then duly performed. Many<br>libations were poured upon the sacred fire. The singers of Samans sang<br>many Samans. Then covering the body of Ganga's son with sandal wood and<br>black aloe and the bark wood, other fragrant fuel, and setting fire to<br>the same, the Kurus with Dhritarashtra and others, stood on the right<br>sight of the funeral pyre. Those foremost ones of Kuru's race, having<br>thus cremated the body of the son of Ganga, proceeded to the sacred<br>Bhagirathi, accompanied by the Rishis. They were followed by Vyasa, by<br>Narada, by Asita, by Krishna, by the ladies of the Bharata race, as also<br>by such of the citizens of Hastinapore as had come to the place. All of<br>them, arrived at the sacred river, duly offered oblation of water unto<br>the high-souled son of Ganga. The goddess Bhagirathi, after those<br>oblations of water had been offered by them unto her son, rose up from<br>the stream, weeping and distracted by sorrow. In the midst of her<br>lamentations, she addressed the Kurus, 'Ye sinless ones, listen to me as<br>I say unto you all that occurred (with respect to my son). Possessed of<br>royal conduct and disposition, and endued with wisdom and high birth, my<br>son was the benefactor of all the seniors of his race. He was devoted to<br>his sire and was of high vows. He could not be vanquished by even Rama of<br>Jamadagni's race with his celestial weapons of great energy. Alas, that<br>hero has been slain by Sikhandin. Ye kings, without doubt, my heart is<br>made of adamant, for it does not break even at the disappearance of that<br>son from my sight! At the Self choice at Kasi, he vanquished on a single<br>car the assembled Kshatriyas and ravished the three princesses (for his<br>step-brother Vichitravirya)! There was no one on earth that equalled him<br>in might. Alas, my heart does not break upon hearing the slaughter of<br>that son of mine by Sikhandin!' The puissant Krishna, hearing the goddess<br>of the great river indulging in these lamentations consoled her with many<br>soothing words. Krishna said, 'O amiable one, be comforted. Do not yield<br>to grief, O thou of beautiful features! Without doubt, thy son has gone<br>to the highest region of felicity! He was one of the Vasus of great<br>energy. Through a curse, O thou of beautiful features, he had to take<br>birth among men. It behoveth thee not to grieve for him. Agreeably to<br>Kshatriya duties, he was slain by Dhananjaya on the field of battle while<br>engaged in battle. He has not been slain, O goddess, by Sikhandin. The<br>very chief of the celestials himself could not slay Bhishma in battle<br>when he stood with stretched bow in hand. O thou of beautiful face, thy<br>son has, in felicity, gone to heaven. All the gods assembled together<br>could not slay him in battle. Do not, therefore, O goddess Ganga, grieve<br>for that son of Kuru's race. He was one of the Vasus, O goddess! Thy son<br>has gone to heaven. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'That foremost of all rivers, thus addressed by<br>Krishna and Vyasa, cast off her grief, O great king, and became restored<br>to equanimity. All the kings there present, headed by Krishna, O monarch,<br>having honoured that goddess duly, received her permission to depart from<br>her banks.'"<br><br>The end of Anusasana Parva.
