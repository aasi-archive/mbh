                            "Bhishma said, 'The chief of the deities, Indra, after the Pitri has<br>ceased to speak, addressed the puissant Hari, saying, 'O Lord, what are<br>those acts by which thou becomest gratified? How, indeed, do men succeed<br>in gratifying thee?'<br><br>"Vishnu said, "That which I greatly hate is the detraction of Brahmanas;<br>without doubt, if the Brahmanas are worshipped, I regard myself<br>worshipped. All superior Brahmanas should always be saluted with<br>reverence, after feeding them with hospitality. One should reverence<br>one's own feet also (in the evening). I am gratified with men who act in<br>this way, as also with those who worship and make offerings to the whirl<br>that is noticeable on cowdung (when it first drops from the cow)[548].<br>They who behold a Brahmana that is a dwarf in stature, or a boar that has<br>just risen from water and that bears on his head a quantity of mud taken<br>up from the bank, have never to meet with any evil. They become freed<br>from every sin. That man who worships every day the Aswattha (Ficus<br>religiosa) and the substance called Gorochana and the cow, is regarded as<br>worshipping the whole universe with the deities and Asuras and human<br>beings. Verily, staying within these, I accept, in my own form, the<br>worship that is offered to them. The worship that is offered to these is<br>the worship offered to me. This has been so as long as the worlds have<br>been created. Those men of little understanding that worship me in a<br>different way worship me in vain, for the worship of that kind I never<br>accept. Verily, the worship of other kinds is not at all gratifying to<br>me.'<br><br>"Indra said, 'Why dost thou applaud the circular marks on cowdung, the<br>feet, the boar, the Brahmana that is a dwarf in stature, and mud raised<br>up from the soil? It is thou who createst and it is thou who destroyest<br>them. Thou art the eternal nature of all mortal or transitory things:'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Hearing these words of Indra. Vishnu smiled a little<br>and then said, 'It was with my circular disc that the Daityas were slain.<br>It was with my two feet that the world was covered. Assuming the form of<br>a boar I slew Hiranyaksha. Assuming the form of a dwarf I conquered (the<br>Asura) king Vali. Those high-souled men who worship these gratify me.<br>Verily, they who worship me in these forms never meet with discomfiture.<br>If one beholding a Brahmana leading the Brahmacharya mode of life arrived<br>at one's house, offers unto him the first portion of one's food that<br>belongs as of right to a Brahmana, and eats what remains thereafter, one<br>is regarded as eating Amrita. If one, after adoring the morning twilight,<br>stands with face directed towards the sun, one reaps the merit that<br>attaches to the performance of ablutions in all tirthas and becomes<br>cleansed of all sins. Ye Rishis possessed of wealth of penances, I have<br>told you in details what constitutes a great mystery. On what else shall<br>I discourse unto you? Tell me your doubts.'<br><br>"Baladeva said, 'Listen now to another great mystery that is fraught with<br>happiness to men. Ignorant persons, unacquainted with it, meet with much<br>distress at the hands of other creatures. That man who, rising at early<br>dawn, touches a cow, ghee, and curds, as also mustard seeds and the<br>larger variety thereof called Priyangu, becomes cleansed of all sins. As<br>regards Rishis possessed of wealth of penances, they always avoid all<br>creatures both before and behind, as also all that is impure while<br>performing Sraddhas.[549]<br><br>"The deities said, 'If a person, taking a vessel of copper, filling it<br>with water, and facing the east, resolves upon a fast or the observance<br>of a particular vow, the deities become gratified with him and all his<br>wishes become crowned with success. By observing fasts, or vows in any<br>other way, men of little understandings gain nothing.[550] In uttering<br>the resolution about the observance of fasts and in making offerings to<br>the deities, the use of a vessel of copper is preferable. In presenting<br>the offerings to the deities, in (giving and accepting) alms, in<br>presenting the ingredients of the Arghya and in offering oblations of<br>water mixed with sesame seeds to the Pitris, a vessel of copper should be<br>used. By doing these acts in any other way, one acquires little merit.<br>Even these mysteries have been laid down relating to how the deities are<br>gratified.'<br><br>"Dharma said, 'The offerings made in all rites in honour of the deities<br>and in those in honour of the Pitris should never be given away to a<br>Brahmana that has accepted service under the king, or that rings the bell<br>or attends to subsidiary duties in acts of worship or at Sraddhas, or<br>that keeps kine, or that is engaged in trade, or that follows some art as<br>a profession, or that is an actor, or that quarrels with friends or that<br>is destitute of Vedic studies, or that marries a Sudra woman[551]. The<br>performer of the Sraddha who gives away such offerings unto such a<br>Brahmana falls away from prosperity and multiplies not his race. He<br>fails, again, to gratify his Pitris by doing such an act. From the house<br>of that person whence a guest returns unsatisfied, the Pitris, the<br>deities, and the sacred fires, all return disappointed in consequence of<br>such treatment of the guest. That man who does not discharge the duties<br>of hospitality towards the guest arrived at his abode, comes to be<br>regarded as equally sinful with those that are slayers of women or of<br>kine, that are ungrateful towards benefactors, that are slayers of<br>Brahmanas, or that are violators of the beds of their preceptors.'<br><br>"Agni said, 'Listen ye with concentrated attention. I shall recite the<br>demerits of that man of wicked understanding who lifts up his feet for<br>striking therewith a cow or a highly blessed Brahmana or a blazing fire.<br>The infamy of such a man spreads throughout the world and touches the<br>confines of heaven itself. His Pitris become filled with fear. The<br>deities also become highly dissatisfied on his account. Endued with great<br>energy, Fire refuses to accept the libations poured by him. For a hundred<br>lives he has to rot in hell. He is never rescued at any time. One should,<br>therefore, never touch a cow with one's feet, or a Brahmana of high<br>energy, or a blazing fire, if one is endued with faith and desires one's<br>own good. These are the demerits declared by me of one who lifts up one's<br>feet towards these three.'<br><br>"Viswamitra said, 'Listen to a high mystery that is unknown to the<br>generality of men and that is connected with religion. He who offers the<br>Pitris rice boiled in sugared milk, sitting with face directed to the<br>south at noontide in the shade caused by an elephant's body, in the month<br>of Bhadrapada, under the constellation Magha, acquires great merits.<br>Listen to what those merits are. The man who makes such an offering to<br>the Pitris under such circumstances, is regarded as performing a great<br>Sraddha each year for thirteen years in succession.'[552]<br><br>"The kine said, 'That man becomes cleansed of all his sins who adores a<br>cow with these Mantras, viz., 'O Vahula, O Samanga, O thou that art<br>fearless everywhere, O thou that art forgiving and full of<br>auspiciousness, O friend, O source of all plenty, in the region of<br>Brahman, in days of yore, thou wert present with thy calf in the<br>sacrifice of Indra, the wielder of the thunderbolt. Thou tookest thy<br>station in the firmament and in the path of Agni. The deities with Narada<br>among them adored thee on that occasion by calling thee Sarvamsaha. Such<br>man attains to the region of Purandara. He acquires, besides, the merits<br>that attach to kine, and the splendour of Chandramas also. Such a man<br>becomes freed from every sin, every fear, every grief. At the end, he<br>obtains residence in the happy region of the Thousand-eyed Indra!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'After this, the highly blessed and celebrated seven<br>Rishis, with Vasishtha at their head, rose and circumambulating the<br>Lotus-born Brahman, stood around him with hands joined in reverence.<br>Vasishtha, that foremost of all persons conversant with Brahma, became<br>their spokesman and asked this question that is beneficial to every<br>creature, but especially so to Brahmanas and Kshatriyas, 'By doing what<br>acts may men of righteous conduct who are, however, destitute of the good<br>of this world, succeed in acquiring merits attaching to sacrifices?'<br>Hearing this question of theirs, the Grandsire Brahman began to say what<br>follows.'<br><br>"Brahman said, 'Excellent is this question, ye highly blessed ones! It is<br>at once auspicious and high and fraught with a mystery. This question<br>that ye have put is subtil and is fraught with high benefit to mankind.<br>Ye Rishis possessed of wealth of penances, I shall recite everything to<br>you in detail. Do ye listen with attention to what I say as to how men<br>acquire the merits attaching to sacrifices (even when they are unable to<br>perform them through poverty.) In the lighted fortnight of the month of<br>Pausha, when the constellation Rohini is in conjunction, if one,<br>purifying oneself by a bath, lies under the cope of heaven, clad in a<br>single piece of raiment, with faith and concentrated attention, and<br>drinks the rays of the moon, one acquires the merits that attach to the<br>performance of great sacrifices. Ye foremost of regenerate persons, this<br>is a high mystery that I declare unto you in reply to your questions, ye<br>that are possessed of insight into the subtil truths of all topics of<br>enquiry.'"
