                            "Maheswara said, 'Searching your memories, excellent are the duties ye<br>all have recited. Listen all of you now to me as I declare some mysteries<br>relating to religion and duty. Only those persons whose understanding has<br>been set on religion and who are possessed of faith, should be instructed<br>in respect of those mysteries of duty and religion that are fraught with<br>high merits. Hear what the merits are that become his who, with heart<br>free from anxiety, gives food everyday, for a month, to kine and contents<br>himself with one meal a day throughout such period. The kine are highly<br>blessed. They are regarded as the most sacred of all sacred things.<br>Verily, it is they that are upholding the three worlds with the deities,<br>the Asuras, and human beings. Respectful services rendered to them are<br>fraught with high merit and grave consequences. That man who every day<br>gives food to kine advances every day in religious merit. Formerly, in<br>the Krita age I had expressed my approval of these creatures. Afterwards<br>Brahman, born of the primeval lotus, solicited me (to show kindness<br>towards kine).[558] It is for this reason that a bull to this day stands<br>as the device on my standard overhead. I always sport with kine. Hence<br>should kine be worshipped by all. Kine are possessed of great power. They<br>are givers of boons. If worshipped, they would grant boons. That person<br>who gives food to kine even for a single day receives from those<br>beneficent creatures for that act a fourth part of the merits he may win<br>by all his good acts in life.'"
