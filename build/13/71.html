                            ''Yudhishthira said, V sinless one, do thou discourse to me more in<br>detail upon the merits that are attainable by making gifts of kine. O<br>thou of mighty arms, I am never satiated with thy words!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is recited the old history of the<br>discourse between the Rishi Uddalaki and his son called Nachiketa. Once<br>on a time the Rishi Uddalaki endued with great intelligence, approaching<br>his son Nachiketa, said unto him, 'Do thou wait upon and serve me.' Upon<br>the completion of the vow he had observed the great Rishi once more said<br>unto his son, 'Engaged in performing my ablutions and deeply taken up<br>with my Vedic study, I have forgotten to bring with me the firewood, the<br>Kusa blades, the flowers, the water jar, and the potherbs I had gathered.<br>Do thou bring me those things from the riverside.' The son proceeded to<br>the spot indicated, but saw that all the articles had been washed away by<br>the current. Coming back to his father, he said, 'I do not see the<br>things!' Afflicted as he then was with hunger, thirst, and fatigue, the<br>Rishi Uddalaki of high ascetic merit, in a sudden wrath, cursed his son,<br>saying, 'Do thou meet with Yama today!' Thus struck by his sire with the<br>thunder of his speech, the son, with joined palms, said, 'Be appeased<br>with me!' Soon, however, he fell down on the earth, deprived of life.<br>Beholding Nachiketa prostrated upon the earth, his sire became deprived<br>of his senses through grief. He, too, exclaiming, 'Alas, what have I<br>done,' fell down on the earth. Filled with grief, as he indulged in<br>lamentations for his son, the rest or that day passed away and night<br>came. Then Nachiketa, O son of Kuru's race, drenched by the tears of his<br>father, gave signs of returning life as he lay on a mat of Kusa grass.<br>His restoration to life under the tears of his sire resembled the<br>sprouting forth of seeds when drenched with auspicious showers. The son<br>just restored to consciousness was still weak. His body was smeared with<br>fragrant unguents and he looked like one just awaking from a deep<br>slumber. The Rishi asked him, saying, 'Hast thou, O son, acquired<br>auspicious regions by thy own acts? By good luck, thou hast been restored<br>to me! Thy body does not seem to be human!' Thus asked by high-souled<br>father, Nachiketa who had seen every thing with his own eyes, made the<br>following answer unto him in the midst of the Rishis, 'In obedience to<br>thy command I proceeded to the extensive region of Yama which is<br>possessed of a delightful effulgence. There I beheld a palatial mansion<br>which extended for thousands of Yojanas and emitted a golden splendour<br>from every part. As soon as Yama beheld me approaching with face towards<br>him, he commanded his attendants saying, 'Give him a good seat, verily,<br>the king of the dead, for thy sake worshipped we with the Arghya and the<br>other ingredients.' Thus worshipped by Yama and seated in the midst of<br>his counsellors, I then said mildly, 'I have come to thy abode, O judge<br>of the dead! Do thou assign me those regions which I deserve for my<br>acts!' Yama then answered me, saying, 'Thou art not dead, O amiable one!'<br>Endued with penances, thy father said unto thee, 'Do thou meet with Yama!<br>The energy of thy sire is like that of a blazing fire. I could not<br>possibly falsify that speech of his. Thou hast seen me. Do thou go hence,<br>O child! The author of thy body is indulging in lamentations for thee.<br>Thou art my dear guest. What wish of thine cherished by thee in thy heart<br>shall I grant thee? Solicit the fruition of whatever desire thou mayst<br>cherish.' Thus addressed by him, I replied unto the king of the dead,<br>saying, 'I have arrived within thy dominions from which no traveller ever<br>returns. If I really be an object deserving of thy attentions, I desire,<br>O king of the dead, to have a sight of those regions of high prosperity<br>and happiness that have been reserved for doers of righteous deeds.' Thus<br>addressed by me, Yama caused me to be mounted upon a vehicle of splendour<br>as effulgent as that of the sun and unto which were harnessed many<br>excellent steeds. Bearing me on that vehicle, he showed me, O foremost of<br>regenerate persons, all those delightful regions that are reserved for<br>the righteous. I beheld in those regions many mansions of great<br>resplendence intended for high-souled persons. Those mansions are of<br>diverse forms and are adorned with every kind of gem. Bright as the disc<br>of the moon, they are ornamented with rows of tinkling bells. Hundreds<br>among them are of many storeys. Within them are pleasant groves and woods<br>and transparent bodies of water. Possessed of the effulgence of lapis<br>lazuli and the sun, and made of silver and gold, their complexion<br>resembles the colour of the morning sun. Some of them are immovable and<br>some movable. Within them are many hills of viands and enjoyable articles<br>and robes and beds in abundance. Within them are many trees capable of<br>granting the fruition of every wish. There are also many rivers and roads<br>and spacious halls and lakes and large tanks. Thousands of cars with<br>rattling wheels may be seen there, having excellent steeds harnessed unto<br>them. Many rivers that run milk, many hills of ghee, and large bodies of<br>transparent water occur there. Verily, I beheld many such regions, never<br>seen by me before of happiness and joy, approved by the king of the dead.<br>Beholding all those objects, I addressed the ancient and puissant judge<br>of the dead, saying, 'For whose use and enjoyment have these rivers with<br>eternal currents of milk and ghee been ordained?' Yama answered me<br>saying, 'These streams of milk and ghee, know thou, are for the enjoyment<br>of those righteous persons, that make gifts in the world of men. Other<br>eternal worlds there are which are filled with such mansions free from<br>sorrow of every kind. These are reserved for those persons that are<br>engaged in making gifts of kine.[353] The mere gift of kine is not worthy<br>of praise. There are considerations of propriety or otherwise about the<br>person unto whom kine should be given, the time for making those gifts,<br>the kind of kine that should form the object of gifts, and the rites that<br>should be observed in making the gifts. Gifts of kine should be made<br>after ascertaining the distinctive qualifications of both Brahmanas (who<br>are to receive them) and the kine themselves (which are to be given<br>away). Kine should not be given unto one in whose abode they are likely<br>to suffer from fire or the sun. That Brahmana who is possessed of Vedic<br>lore, who is of austere penances, and who performs sacrifices, is<br>regarded as worthy of receiving kine in gift. Those kine that have been<br>rescued from distress situation, or that have been given by poor<br>householders from want of sufficient means to feed and cherish them, are,<br>for these reasons, reckoned as of high value.[354] Abstaining from all<br>food and living upon water alone for three nights and sleeping the while<br>on the bare earth, one should, having properly fed the kine one intends<br>to give away, give them unto Brahmanas after having gratified them also<br>(with other gifts). The kine given away should be accompanied by their<br>calves. They should, again, be such as to bring forth good calves, at the<br>proper seasons. They should be accompanied with other articles so given<br>away. Having completed the gift, the giver should live for three days on<br>only milk and forbearing from food of every other kind. He, who gives a<br>cow that is not vicious, that brings forth good calves at proper<br>intervals, and that does not fly away from the owners' house, and<br>accompanies such gift with a vessel of white brass for milking her,<br>enjoys the felicity of heaven for as many years as are measured by the<br>number of hairs on the animal's body. He, who gives unto a Brahmana a<br>bull well-broken and capable of bearing burdens, possessed of strength<br>and young in years, disinclined to do any mischief, large-sized and<br>endued with energy, enjoys those regions, that are reserved for givers of<br>kine. He is regarded as a proper person for receiving a cow in gift who<br>is known to be mild towards kine, who takes kine for his refuge, who is<br>grateful, and who has no means of subsistence assigned unto him. When an<br>old man becomes ill, or when a Brahmana intends to perform a sacrifice,<br>or when one wishes to till for agriculture, or when one gets a son<br>through the efficacy of a Homa performed for the purpose, or for the use<br>of one's preceptor, or for the sustenance of a child (born in the usual<br>way), one should give away a beloved cow. Even these are the<br>considerations that are applauded (in the matter of making gifts of kine)<br>in respect of place and time. The kine that deserve to be given away are<br>those that yield copious measures of milk, or those that are well-known<br>(for their docility and other virtues). or those that have been purchased<br>for a price, or those that have been acquired as honoraria for learning,<br>or those that have been obtained in exchange by offering other living<br>creatures (such as sheep and goats, etc.), or those that have been won by<br>prowess of arms, or those that have been gained as marriage-dower (from<br>fathers-in-law and other relations of the wife).'<br><br>"Nachiketa continued, 'Hearing these words of Vaivaswata, I once more<br>addressed him, saying, 'What are those objects by giving which, when kine<br>are not procurable, givers may yet go to regions reserved for men making<br>gifts of kine?' Questioned by me, the wise Yama answered, explaining<br>further what the end is that is attainable by making gifts of kine. He<br>said, 'In the absence of kine, a person by making gifts of what has been<br>regarded as the substitute of kine, wins the merit of making gifts of<br>kine. If, in the absence of kine, one makes a gift of a cow made of ghee,<br>observant of a vow the while, one gets for one's use these rivers of ghee<br>all of which approach one like an affectionate mother approaching her<br>beloved child. If, in the absence of even a cow made of ghee, one makes a<br>gift of a cow made of sesame seeds, observing a cow the while, one<br>succeeds with the assistance of that cow to get over all calamities in<br>this world and to enjoy great happiness hereafter from these rivers of<br>milk that thou beholdest! If in the absence of a cow made of sesame<br>seeds, one makes a gift of a cow made of water one succeeds in coming to<br>these happy regions and enjoying this river of cool and transparent<br>water, that is, besides capable of granting the fruition of every wish.'<br>The king of the dead explained to me all this while I was his guest, and,<br>O thou of unfading glory, great was the joy that I felt at sight of all<br>the wonders he showed me. I shall now tell thee what would certainly be<br>agreeable to thee. I have now got a great sacrifice whose performance<br>does not require much wealth. That sacrifice (constituted by gifts of<br>kine) may be said to flow from me, O sire! Others will obtain it also. It<br>is not inconsistent with the ordinances of the Vedas. The curse that thou<br>hadst pronounced upon me was no curse but was in reality a blessing,<br>since it enabled me to have a sight of the great king of the dead. There<br>I have beheld what the rewards are that attach to gifts. I shall,<br>henceforth, O thou of great soul, practise the duty of gift without any<br>doubt lurking in my mind respecting its rewards. And, O great Rishi, the<br>righteous Yama, filled with joy, repeatedly told me, 'One, who, by making<br>frequent gifts, has succeeded in acquiring purity of mind should then<br>make gifts of kine specially. This topic (about gifts) is fraught with<br>sanctity. Do thou never disregard the duties in respect of gifts. Gifts,<br>again, should be made unto deserving persons, when time and place are<br>suitable. Do thou, therefore, always make gifts of kine. Never entertain<br>any doubts in this respect. Devoted to the path of gifts, many<br>high-souled persons in days of yore used to make gifts of kine. Fearing<br>to practise austere penances, they made gifts according to the extent of<br>their power. In time they cast off all sentiments of pride and vanity,<br>and purified their souls. Engaged in performing Sraddhas in honour of the<br>Pitris and in all acts of righteousness, they used to make, according to<br>the extent of their power, gifts of kine, and as the reward of those acts<br>they have attained to heaven and are shining in effulgence for such<br>righteousness. One should, on the eighth day of the moon that is known by<br>the name of Kamyashtami, make gifts of kine, properly won, unto the<br>Brahmanas after ascertaining the eligibility of the recipients (by the<br>ordinances already laid down). After making the gift, one should then<br>subsist for ten days together upon only the milk of kine, their dung and<br>their urine (abstaining from all other food the while). The merit that<br>one acquires by making a gift of a bull is equal to that which attaches<br>to the divine vow. By making a gift of a couple of kine one acquires, as<br>the reward thereof, a mastery of the Vedas. By making a gift of cars and<br>vehicles with kine yoked thereto, one acquires the merit of baths in<br>sacred waters. By making a gift of a cow of the Kapila species, one<br>becomes cleansed of all one's sins. Verily, by giving away even a single<br>cow of the Kapila species that has been acquired by legitimate means, one<br>becomes cleansed of all the sins one may have committed. There is nothing<br>higher (in point of tastes) than the milk which is yielded by kine. The<br>gift of a cow is truly regarded as a very superior gift. Kine by yielding<br>milk, rescue all the worlds from calamity. It is kine, again, that<br>produce the food upon which creatures subsist. One, who, knowing the<br>extent of the service that kine do, does not entertain in one's heart<br>affection for kine, is a sinner that is certain to sink in hell.[355] If<br>one gives a thousand or a hundred or ten or five kine, verily, if one<br>gives unto a righteous Brahmana even a single cow which brings forth good<br>calves at proper intervals, one is sure to see that cow approach one in<br>heaven in the form of a river of sacred water capable of granting the<br>fruition of every wish. In respect of the prosperity and the growth that<br>kine confer, in the matter also of the protection that kine grant unto<br>all creatures of the earth, kine are equal to the very rays of the sun<br>that fall on the earth.[356] The word that signifies the cow stands also<br>for the rays of the sun. The giver of a cow becomes the progenitor of a<br>very large race that extends over a large part of the earth. Hence, he<br>that gives a cow shines like a second sun in resplendence. The disciple<br>should, in the matter of making gifts of kine, select his preceptor. Such<br>a disciple is sure to go to heaven. The selection of a preceptor (in the<br>matter of the performance of pious deeds) is regarded as a high duty by<br>persons conversant with the ordinances. This is, indeed, the initial<br>ordinance. All other ordinances (respecting the gift of kine) depend upon<br>it.[357] Selecting, after examination, an eligible person among the<br>Brahmanas, one should make unto him the gift of a cow that has been<br>acquired by legitimate means, and having made the gift cause him to<br>accept it. The deities and men and ourselves also, in wishing good to<br>other, say, 'Let the merits attaching to gifts be thine in consequence of<br>thy righteousness!' Even thus did the judge of the dead speak unto me, O<br>regenerate Rishi. I then bowed my head unto the righteous Yama. Obtaining<br>his permission I left his dominions and have now come to the sole of thy<br>feet.'"
