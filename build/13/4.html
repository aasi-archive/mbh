                            "Bhishma said, 'Listen truly in detail, O son of Pritha, how in olden<br>times Viswamitra attained to the status of a Brahmana Rishi. There was, O<br>foremost of Bharata's descendants, in the race of Bharata, a king of the<br>name of Ajamida, who performed many sacrifices and was the best of all<br>virtuous men. His son was the great king named Jahnu. Ganga was the<br>daughter of this high-minded prince. The farfamed and equally virtuous<br>Sindhudwipa was the son of this prince. From Sindhudwipa sprung the great<br>royal sage Valakaswa. His son was named Vallabha who was like a second<br>Dharma in embodied form. His son again was Kusika who was refulgent with<br>glory like unto the thousand-eyed Indra. Kusika's son was the illustrious<br>King Gadhi who, being childless and desiring to have a son born unto him,<br>repaired to the forest. Whilst living there, a daughter was born unto<br>him. She was called Satyavati by name, and in beauty of appearance she<br>had no equal on Earth. The illustrious son of Chyavana, celebrated by the<br>name of Richika, of the race of Bhrigu, endued with austere penances,<br>sought the hand of this lady. Gadhi, the destroyer of his enemies,<br>thinking him to be poor, did not bestow her in marriage upon the<br>high-souled Richika. But when the latter, thus dismissed, was going away,<br>the excellent king, addressing him said,&#8212;'If thou givest me a marriage<br>dower thou shalt have my daughter for thy wife.'<br><br>"Richika said, 'What dower, O king, shall I offer thee for the hand of<br>thy daughter? Tell me truly, without feeling any hesitation in the<br>matter. Gadhi said,&#8212;'O descendant of Bhrigu, do thou give me a thousand<br>horses fleet as the wind, and possessing the hue of moon-beams, and each<br>having one ear black.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Then that mighty son of Chyavana who was the foremost of<br>Bhrigu's race, besought the deity Varuna, the son of Aditi, who was the<br>lord of all the waters.&#8212;O best of gods, I pray to thee to give me a<br>thousand horses, all endued with the speed of the wind and with<br>complexion as effulgent as the moon's, but each having one ear black. The<br>god Varuna, the son of Aditi, said to that excellent scion of Bhrigu's<br>race,&#8212;Be it so. Wheresoever thou shalt seek, the horses shalt arise (in<br>thy presence).&#8212;As soon as Richika thought of them, there arose from the<br>waters of Ganga thousand high-mettled horses, as lustrous in complexion<br>as the moon. Not far from Kanyakubja, the sacred bank of Ganga is still<br>famous among men as Aswatirtha in consequence of the appearance of those<br>horses at that place. Then Richika, that best of ascetics, pleased in<br>mind, gave those thousand excellent horses unto Gadhi as the<br>marriage-dower. King Gadhi, filled with wonder and fearing to be cursed,<br>gave his daughter, bedecked with jewels, unto that son of Bhrigu. That<br>foremost of regenerate Rishis accepted her hand in marriage according to<br>the prescribed rites. The princess too was well-pleased at finding<br>herself the wife of that Brahmana. That foremost of regenerate Rishis, O<br>Bharata, was well pleased with her conduct and expressed a wish to grant<br>her boon. The princess, O excellent king, related this to her mother. The<br>mother addressed the daughter that stood before her with down-cast eyes,<br>saving,&#8212;It behoves thee, O my daughter, to secure a favour for me also<br>from thy husband. That sage of austere penances is capable of granting a<br>boon to me, the boon, viz. of the birth of a son to me.&#8212;Then, O king,<br>returning quickly to her husband Richika, the princess related to him all<br>that had been desired by her mother. Richika said,&#8212;By my favour, O<br>blessed one, she will soon give birth to a son possessed of every virtue.<br>May thy request be fulfilled. Of thee too shall be born a mighty and<br>glorious son who, endued with virtue, shall perpetuate my race. Truly do<br>I say this unto thee! When you two shall bathe in your season, she shall<br>embrace a peepul tree, and thou, O excellent lady, shalt likewise embrace<br>a fig tree, and by so doing shall ye attain the object of your desire. O<br>sweetly-smiling lady, both she and you shall have to partake of these two<br>sacrificial offerings (charu)[8]rated with hymns, and then shall ye<br>obtain sons (as desired).&#8212;At this, Satyavati, delighted at heart, told<br>her mother all that had been said by Richika as also of the two balls of<br>charu. Then the mother, addressing her daughter Satyavati, said:&#8212;O<br>daughter, as I am deserving of greater consideration from thee than thy<br>husband, do thou obey my words. The charu, duly consecrated with hymns,<br>which thy husband has given to thee, do thou give unto me and thyself<br>take the one that has been prescribed for me. O sweetly-smiling one of<br>blameless character, if thou hast any respect for my word, let us change<br>the trees respectively designed for us. Every one desires to possess an<br>excellent and stainless being for his own son. The glorious Richika too<br>must have acted from a similar motive in this matter, as will appear in<br>the end. For this reason, O beautiful girl, my heart inclines towards thy<br>charu, and thy tree, and thou too shouldst consider how to secure an<br>excellent brother for thyself.&#8212;The mother and the daughter Satyavati<br>having acted in this way, they both, O Yudhishthira, became big with<br>child. And that great Rishi, the excellent descendant of Bhrigu, finding<br>his wife quick with child, was pleased at heart, and addressing her,<br>said,&#8212;O excellent lady, thou hast not done well in exchanging the charu<br>as will soon become apparent. It is also clear that thou hast changed the<br>trees. I had placed the entire accumulated energy of Brahma in thy charu<br>and Kshatriya energy in the charu of thy mother. I had so ordered that<br>thou wouldst give birth to a Brahmana whose virtues would be famous<br>throughout the three worlds, and that she (thy mother) would give birth<br>to an excellent Kshatriya. But now, O excellent lady, that thou hast<br>reversed the order (of the charu) so, thy mother will give birth to an<br>excellent Brahmana and thou too, O excellent lady, will give birth to a<br>Kshatriya terrible in action. Thou hast not done will, O lady, by acting<br>thus out of affection for thy mother.&#8212;Hearing this, O king the excellent<br>lady Satyavati, struck with sorrow, fell upon the ground like a beautiful<br>creeper cut in twain. Regaining her senses and bowing unto her lord with<br>head (bent), the daughter of Gadhi said to her husband, that foremost one<br>of Bhrigu's race,&#8212;O regenerate Rishi, O thou that art foremost amongst<br>those versed in Brahma, do thou take pity on me, thy wife, who is thus<br>appeasing thee and so order that a Kshatriya son may not be born unto me.<br>Let my grandson be such a one as will be famous for his terrible<br>achievements, if it be thy desire, but not my son, O Brahmana. Do thou<br>confer this favour on me.&#8212;Be it so,&#8212;said that man of austere penances<br>to his wife and then, O king, she gave birth to a blessed son named<br>Jamadagni. The celebrated wife of Gadhi too gave birth to the regenerate<br>Rishi Viswamitra versed in the knowledge of Brahma, by favour of that<br>Rishi. The highly devout Viswamitra, though a Kshatriya, attained to the<br>state of a Brahmana and became the founder of a race of Brahmanas. His<br>sons became high-souled progenitors of many races of Brahmanas who were<br>devoted to austere penances, learned in the Vedas, and founders, of many<br>clans. The adorable Madhuchcchanda and the mighty Devrat, Akshina,<br>Sakunta, Vabhru, Kalapatha, the celebrated Yajnavalkya, Sthula of high<br>vows, Uluka, Mudgala, and the sage Saindhavayana, the illustrious<br>Valgujangha and the great Rishi Galeva, Ruchi, the celebrated Vajra, as<br>also Salankayana, Liladhya and Narada, the one known as Kurchamuka, and<br>Vahuli, Mushala, as also Vakshogriva, Anghrika, Naikadrik, Silayupa,<br>Sita, Suchi, Chakraka, Marrutantavya, Vataghna, Aswalayana, and<br>Syamayana, Gargya, and Javali, as also Susruta, Karishi, Sangsrutya, and<br>Para Paurava, and Tantu, the great sage Kapila, Tarakayana, Upagahana,<br>Asurayani, Margama, Hiranyksha, Janghari, Bhavravayani, and Suti,<br>Bibhuti, Suta, Surakrit, Arani, Nachika, Champeya, Ujjayana, Navatantu,<br>Vakanakha, Sayanya, Yati, Ambhoruha, Amatsyasin, Srishin, Gardhavi<br>Urjjayoni, Rudapekahin, and the great Rishi Naradin,&#8212;these Munis were<br>all sons of Viswamitra and were versed in the knowledge of Brahma. O king<br>Yudhishthira, the highly austere and devout Viswamitra, although a<br>Kshatriya (by descent), became a Brahmana for Richika having placed the<br>energy of supreme Brahma (in the charu), O foremost prince of Bharata's<br>race, I have now related to you, with all details, the story of the birth<br>of Viswamitra who was possessed of energy of the sun, the moon, and the<br>fire-god. O best of kings, if thou hast any doubt with regard to any<br>other matter, do thou let me know it, so that I may remove it.'"
