                            "Yudhishthira said, 'It has been said that sojourns to sacred waters as<br>fraught with merit; that ablutions in such waters is meritorious; and<br>that listening to the excellence of such waters is also meritorious. I<br>desire to hear thee expatiate on this subject, O grandsire. It behoveth<br>thee, O chief of Bharata's race, to mention to me the sacred waters that<br>exist on this earth. I desire, O thou of great puissance, to hear thee<br>discourse on this topic.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O thou of great splendour, the following enumeration of<br>the sacred waters on the Earth was made by Angiras. Blessed be thou, it<br>behoveth thee to listen to it for thou shalt then earn great merit. Once<br>on a time, Gautama of rigid vows, approaching the great and learned Rishi<br>Angiras endued with tranquillity of soul, while he was dwelling in a<br>forest, questioned him, saying,&#8212;O illustrious one, I have some doubts<br>regarding the merits attaching to sacred waters and shrines. So I desire<br>to hear thee discourse on that topic. Do thou, therefore, O ascetic,<br>discourse to me. What merits are earned by a person in respect of the<br>next world, by bathing in the sacred waters on the Earth, O thou of great<br>wisdom? Do thou expound to me this truly and according to the ordinance.'<br><br>"Angiras said, 'A person by bathing for seven days in succession in the<br>Chandrabhaga or the Vitasta whose waters are always seen to dance in<br>waves, observing a fast the while, is sure to become cleansed of all his<br>sins and endued with the merit of an ascetic.[233] The very many rivers<br>that flowing through Kasmira, fall into the great river called Sindhu<br>(Indus). By bathing in these rivers one is sure to become endued with<br>good character and to ascend to heaven after departing from this world.<br>By bathing in Pushkara, and Prabhasa, and Naimisha, and the ocean, and<br>Devika, and Indramarga, and Swarnavindu, one is sure to ascend to heaven<br>being seated on a celestial car, and filled with transports of joy at the<br>adorations of Apsara. By plunging in the waters of Hiranyavindu with a<br>concentrated mind and reverencing that sacred stream, and bathing next at<br>Kusesaya and Devendra, one becomes cleansed of all one's sins. Repairing<br>to Indratoya in the vicinity of the mountains of Gandhamadana and next to<br>Karatoya in the country called Kuranga, one should observe a fast for<br>three days and then bathe in those sacred waters with a concentrated<br>heart and pure body. By doing this, one is sure to acquire the merit of a<br>Horse-sacrifice. Bathing in Gangadwara and Kusavarta and Vilwaka in the<br>Nita mountains, as also in Kankhala, one is sure to become cleansed of<br>all one's sins and then ascend to heaven. If one becomes a Brahmacharin<br>and subdues one's wrath, devotes oneself to truth and practises<br>compassion towards all creatures, and then bathes in the Jala parda (Lake<br>of Waters), one is sure to acquire the merit of a Horse-sacrifice. That<br>part where Bhagirathi-Ganga flows in a northward direction is known as<br>the union of heaven, earth, and the nether regions. Observing a fast for<br>one month and bathing in that sacred Tirtha which is known to be<br>acceptable to Maheswara, one becomes competent to behold the deities. One<br>who gives oblations of water unto one's Pitris at Saptaganga and Triganga<br>and Indramarga, obtains ambrosia for food, if one has still to undergo<br>rebirth. The man who in a pure state of body and mind attends to his<br>daily Agnihotra and observes a fast for one month and then baths in<br>Mahasrama, is sure to attain success in one month. By bathing, after a<br>fast of three days and purifying the mind of all evil passions, in the<br>large lake of Bhrigu Kunda, one becomes cleansed of even the sin of<br>Brahmanicide. By bathing in Kanyakupa and performing one's ablutions in<br>Valaka, one acquires great fame among even the deities and shines in<br>glory. Bathing in Devika and the lake known by the name of Sundarika as<br>also in the Tirtha called Aswini, one acquires, in one's next life, great<br>beauty of form. By fasting for a fortnight and bathing in Mahaganga and<br>Krittikangaraka, one becomes cleansed of all one's sins and ascends to<br>heaven. Bathing in Vaimanika and Kinkinika, one acquires the power of<br>repairing everywhere at will and becomes an object of great respect in<br>the celestial region of the Apsaras.[234] If a person, subduing his wrath<br>and observing the vow of Brahmacharyya for three days, bathes in the<br>river Vipasa at the retreat called Kalika, he is sure to succeed in<br>transcending the obligation of rebirth. Bathing in the asylum that is<br>sacred to the Krittakas and offering oblations of water to the Pitris,<br>and then gratifying Mahadeva, one becomes pure in body and mind and<br>ascends to heaven. If one, observing a fast for three days with a<br>purified body and mind, bathes in Mahapura, one becomes freed from the<br>fear of all mobile and immobile animals as also of all animals having two<br>feet. By bathing in the Devadaru forest and offering oblations of water<br>to the Pitris and dwelling there for seven nights with a pure body and<br>mind, one attains to the region of the deities on departing from this<br>world. Bathing in the waterfalls at Sarastamva and Kusastambha and<br>Dronasarmapada, one is sure to attain to the region of the Apsaras where<br>one is waited upon with dutiful services by those superhuman beings. If<br>one, observing a fast, bathes at Chitrakuta and Janasthana and the waters<br>of Mandakini, one is sure to be united with prosperity that is<br>royal.[235] By repairing to the retreat that is known by the name of<br>Samya and residing there for a fortnight and bathing in the sacred water<br>that exists there, one acquires the power of disappearing at will (and<br>enjoy the happiness that has been ordained for the Gandharvas). Repairing<br>to the tirtha known by the name of Kausiki and residing there with a pure<br>heart and abstaining from all food and drink for three days, one acquires<br>the power of dwelling (in one's next life) in the happy region of the<br>Gandharvas. Bathing in the delightful tirtha that goes by the name of<br>Gandhataraka and residing there for one month, abstaining all the while<br>from food and drink, one acquires the power of disappearing at pleasure<br>and, then one and twenty days, of ascending to heaven. He that bathes in<br>the lake known by the name of Matanga is sure to attain to success in one<br>night. He that bathes in Analamva or in eternal Andhaka, or in Naimisha,<br>or the tirtha called Swarga, and offers oblations of water to the Pitris,<br>subduing his senses the while, acquires the Merit of a human<br>sacrifice.[236] Bathing in Ganga hrada and the tirtha known by the name<br>of Utpalavana and daily offering oblations of water there for a full<br>month to the Pitris, one acquires the merit of a Horse-sacrifice. Bathing<br>in the confluence of the Ganga and the Yamuna as also at the tirtha in<br>the Kalanjara mountains and offering every day oblations of water to the<br>Pitris for a full month, one acquires the merit that attaches to ten<br>Horse-sacrifices. Bathing in the Shashthi lake one acquires merit much<br>greater than what is attached to the gift of food. Ten thousand tirthas<br>and thirsty millions of other tirthas come to Prayaga (the confluence of<br>Ganga and Yamuna), O chief of Bharata's race in the month of Magha. He<br>who bathes in Prayaga, with a restrained soul and observing rigid vows<br>the while, in the month of Magha, becomes cleansed of all his sins, O<br>chief of Bharata's race, and attains to heaven. Bathing in the tirtha<br>that is sacred to the Maruts, as also in that which is situate in the<br>retreat of the Pitris, and also in that which is known by the name of<br>Vaivaswata, one becomes cleansed of all one's sins and becomes as pure<br>and sanctified as a tirtha. Repairing to Brahmasaras as also to the<br>Bhagirathi and bathing there and offering oblations to the Pitris every<br>day for a full month, abstaining from food all the while, one is sure to<br>attain to the region of Soma, Bathing in Utpataka and then in Ashtavakra<br>and offering oblations of water to the Pitris every day for twelve days<br>in succession, abstaining the while from food, one acquires the merits of<br>a Horse-sacrifice. Bathing in Asmaprishtha and Niravinda mountains and<br>Kraunchapadi,&#8212;all three in Gaya&#8212;one becomes cleansed of the sin of<br>Brahmanicide. A bath in the first place cleanses one of a single<br>Brahmanicide; a bath in the second cleanses one of two offences of that<br>character; and a bath in the third cleanses one of three such offences.<br>Bathing in Kalavinga, one acquires a large quantity of water (for use in<br>the next world). A man, by bathing in the city of Agni, acquires such<br>merit as entitles him to live during his next birth in the city of Agni's<br>daughter. Bathing in Visala in Karavirapura and offering oblations of<br>water unto one's Pitris, and performing one's ablutions in Devahrada too,<br>one becomes identified with Brahma and shines in glory as such. Bathing<br>in Punaravarta-nanda as also Mahananda, a man of restrained senses and<br>universal compassion repairs to the celestial gardens called Nandana of<br>Indra and is waited upon there by Apsaras of diverse tribes. Bathing with<br>concentrated soul in the tirtha that is called after the name of Urvasi<br>and that is situate in the river Lohitya, on the day of full moon of the<br>month of Kartika, one attains to the merits that attach to the sacrifice<br>called Pundarika. Bathing in Ramahrada and offering oblations of water to<br>the Pitris in the river Vipasa (Beas), and observing a fast for twelve<br>days, one becomes cleansed of all sins. Bathing in the tirtha called<br>Maha-hrada with a purified heart and after observing a fast for one<br>month, one is sure to attain to the end which was the sage Jamadagni's.<br>By exposing oneself to heat in the tirtha called Vindhya, a person<br>devoted to truth and endued with compassion for all creatures should then<br>betake himself to austere penances, actuated by humility. By so doing, he<br>is sure to attain to ascetic success in course of a single month. Bathing<br>in the Narmada as also in the tirtha known by the name of Surparaka,<br>observing a fast for a full fortnight, one is sure to become in one's<br>next birth a prince of the royal line. If one proceeds with restrained<br>senses and a concentrated soul to the tirtha known under the name of<br>Jamvumarga, one is sure to attain to success in course of a single day<br>and night. By repairing to Chandalikasrama and bathing in the tirtha<br>called Kokamukha, having subsisted for sometime on potherbs alone and<br>worn rags for vestments, one is sure to obtain ten maidens of great<br>beauty for one's spouses. One who lives by the side of the tirtha known<br>by the name of Kanya-hrada has never to go to the regions of Yama. Such a<br>person is sure to ascend to the regions of felicity that belong to the<br>celestials. One who bathes with restrained senses on the day of the new<br>moon in the tirtha known by the name of Prabhasa, is sure, O thou of<br>mighty arms, of at once attaining to success and immortality. Bathing in<br>the tirtha known by the name of Ujjanaka which occurs in the retreat of<br>Arshtisena's son, and next in the tirtha that is situate in the retreat<br>of Pinga, one is sure to be cleansed of all one's sins. Observing a fast<br>for three days and bathing in the tirtha known as Kulya and reciting the<br>sacred mantras that go by the name of Aghamarshana, one attains the merit<br>of a horse-sacrifice. Observing a fast for one night and bathing in<br>Pindaraka, one becomes purified on the dawn of the next day and attains<br>to the merit of an Agnishtoma sacrifice. One who repairs to Brahmasara<br>which is adorned by the woods called Dharmaranya, becomes cleansed of all<br>one's sins and attains to the merit of the Pundarika sacrifice. Bathing<br>in the waters of the Mainaka mountain and saying one's morning and<br>evening prayers there and living at the spot for a month, restraining<br>desire, one attains to the merit of all the sacrifices. Setting out for<br>Kalolaka and Nandikunda and Uttara-manasa, and reaching a spot that is<br>hundred yojanas remote from any of them, one becomes cleansed of the sin<br>of foeticide, One who succeeds in obtaining a sight of image of<br>Nandiswara, becomes cleansed of all sins. Bathing in the tirtha called<br>Swargamarga one is sure to proceed to the regions of Brahman. The<br>celebrated Himavat is sacred. That prince of mountains is the<br>father-in-law of Sankara. He is a mine of all jewels and gems and is the<br>resort of the Siddhas and Charanas. That regenerate person who is fully<br>conversant with the Vedas and who, regarding this life to be exceedingly<br>unstable, casts off his body on those mountains, abstaining from all food<br>and drink in accordance with the rites laid down in the scriptures, after<br>having adored the deities and bent his head in worship of the ascetics,<br>is sure to attain to success and proceed to the eternal regions of<br>Brahman. There is nothing unattainable to him who resides in a tirtha,<br>restraining lust and subjugating wrath, in consequence of such residence.<br>For the purpose of repairing to all the tirthas in the world, one should<br>mentally think of those amongst them that are almost inaccessible or<br>sojourns to which are attended with insurmountable difficulties. Sojourns<br>to tirthas is productive of the merits of sacrifices. They are competent<br>to cleanse everybody of sin. Fraught with great excellence, they are<br>capable of leading to heaven. The subject is truly a great mystery. The<br>very deities should bathe in tirthas. To them also they are<br>sin-cleansing. This discourse on tirthas should be imparted to Brahmanas,<br>and to such honest or righteous persons as are bent upon achieving what<br>is for their own good. It should also be recited in the hearing of one's<br>well-wishers and friends and of one's obedient and devoted disciples.<br>Angiras possessed of great ascetic merit, had imparted this discourse to<br>Gautama. Angiras himself had obtained it from Kasyapa of great<br>intelligence. The great Rishi regard this discourse as worthy of constant<br>repetition. It is the foremost of all cleansing things. If one recites it<br>regularly every day, one is sure to become cleansed of every sin and to<br>proceed to heaven after the termination of this life. One who listens to<br>this discourse recited in his hearing,&#8212;this discourse, viz., of Angiras,<br>that is regarded as a mystery,&#8212;is sure to attain in one's next life to<br>be born in a good family and, what is more, one would become endued with<br>the memory of one's previous existence.'"
