                            "Bhishma said, 'In this connection, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, is<br>recited by the righteous the narrative of the great calamity that<br>overtook king Nriga in consequence of his spoliation of what had belonged<br>to a Brahmans. Some time before, certain young men of Yadu's race, while<br>searching for water, had come upon a large well covered with grass and<br>creepers. Desirous of drawing water from it, they laboured very much for<br>removing the creepers that covered its mouth. After the mouth had been<br>cleaned, they beheld within the well a very large lizard residing within<br>it. The young men made strong and repeated efforts for rescuing the<br>lizard from that situation. Resembling a very hill in size, the lizard<br>was sought to be freed by means of cords and leathern tongs. Not<br>succeeding in their intention the young men then went to Janardana.<br>Addressing him they said, 'Covering the entire space of a well, there is<br>a very large lizard to be seen. Notwithstanding our best efforts we have<br>not succeeded in rescuing it from that situation.' Even this was what<br>they represented unto Krishna. Vasudeva then proceeded to the spot and<br>took out the lizard and questioned it as to who it was. The lizard said<br>that it was identical with the soul of king Nriga who had flourished in<br>days of old and who had performed many sacrifices. Unto the lizard that<br>said those words, Madhava spoke, 'Thou didst perform many righteous acts.<br>No sin didst thou commit. Why, then, O king, hast thou come to such a<br>distressful end? Do thou explain what this is and why it has been brought<br>about. We have heard that thou didst repeatedly make gifts unto the<br>Brahmanas of hundreds upon hundreds of thousands and once again eight<br>times hundreds upon hundreds of ten thousands of kine.[351] Why,<br>therefore, has this end overtaken thee?' Nriga then replied unto Krishna,<br>saying, 'On one occasion a cow belonging to a Brahmana who regularly<br>worshipped his domestic fire, escaping from the owner's abode while he<br>was absent from home entered my flock. The keepers of my cattle included<br>that cow in their tale of a thousand. In time that cow was given away by<br>me unto a Brahmana, acting as I did from desire of happiness in heaven.<br>The true owner, returning home, sought for his lost cow and at last saw<br>it in the house of another.' Finding her, the owner said, 'This cow is<br>mine!' The other person contested his claim, till both, disputing and<br>excited with wrath, came to me. Addressing me one of them said, 'Thou<br>hast been the giver of this cow!' The other one said, 'Thou hast robbed<br>me of this cow&#8212;she is mine! I then solicited the Brahmana unto whom I<br>had given that cow, to return the gift in exchange for hundreds upon<br>hundreds of other kine. Without acceding to my earnest solicitations, he<br>addressed me, saying. 'The cow I have got is well-suited to time and<br>place. She yields a copious measure of milk, besides being very quiet and<br>very fond of us. The mills she yields is very sweet. She is regarded as<br>worthy of every praise in my house. She is nourishing, besides, a weak<br>child of mine that has just been weaned. She is incapable of being given<br>up by me.' Having said these words, the Brahmana went away. I then<br>solicited the other Brahmana offering him an exchange, and saying, 'Do<br>thou take a hundred thousand kine for this one cow.' The Brahmana,<br>however, replied unto me, saying, 'I do not accept gifts from persons of<br>the kingly order. I am able to get on without help. De thou then, without<br>loss of time, give me that very cow which was mine.' Even thus, O slayer<br>of Madhu, did that Brahmana speak unto me. I offered to make gifts unto<br>him of gold and silver and horses and cars. That foremost of Brahmanas<br>refused to accept any of these as gift and went away. Meanwhile, urged by<br>time's irresistible influence, I had to depart from this world. Wending<br>to the region of the Pitris I was taken to the presence of the king of<br>the dead. Worshipping me duly Yama addressed me, saying, 'The end cannot<br>be ascertained, O king, of thy deed. There is, however, a little sin<br>which was unconsciously perpetrated by thee. Do thou suffer the<br>punishment for that sin now or afterwards as it pleases thee. Thou hadst<br>(upon thy accession to the throne) sworn that thou wouldst protect (all<br>persons in the enjoyment of their own). That oath of thine was not<br>rigidly kept by thee. Thou tookest also what belonged to a Brahmana. Even<br>this has been the two-fold sin thou hast committed.' I answered, saying,<br>'I shall first undergo the distress of punishment, and when that is over,<br>I shall enjoy the happiness that is in store for me, O lord!' After I had<br>said those words unto the king of the dead, I fell down on the Earth.<br>Though fallen down I still could hear the words that Yama said unto me<br>very loudly. Those words were, Janardana the son of Vasudeva, will rescue<br>thee! Upon the completion of a full thousand years, when the demerit will<br>be exhausted of thy sinful act, thou shalt then attain to many regions of<br>inexhaustible felicity that have been acquired by thee through thy own<br>acts of righteousness. Falling down I found myself, with head downwards,<br>within this well, transformed into a creature of the intermediate order.<br>Memory, however, did not leave me. By thee I have been rescued today.<br>What else can it testify to than the puissance of thy penances? Let me<br>have thy permission. O Krishna! I desire to ascend to heaven! permitted<br>then by Krishna, king Nriga bowed his head unto him and then mounted a<br>celestial car and proceeded to heaven. After Nriga had thus proceeded to<br>heaven, O best of the Bharatas, Vasudeva recited this verse, O delighter<br>of the Kurus. No one should consciously appropriate anything belonging to<br>a Brahmana. The property of a Brahmana, if taken, destroys the taker even<br>as the Brahmana's cow destroyed king Nriga! I tell thee, again, O Partha,<br>that a meeting with the good never proves fruitless. Behold, king Nriga<br>was rescued from hell through meeting with one that is good. As a gift is<br>productive of merit even so an act of spoliation leads to demerit. Hence<br>also, O Yudhishthira, one should avoid doing any injury to kine.'"[352]
