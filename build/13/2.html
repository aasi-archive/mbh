                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, O wisest of men, O thou that art<br>learned in all the scriptures, I have listened to this great story, O<br>foremost of intelligent men. I am desirous of again hearing the recital<br>of some history full of religious instruction, and it behoves thee to<br>gratify me. O lord of Earth, tell me if any householder has ever<br>succeeded in conquering Mrityu by the practice of virtue. Do thou recite<br>this to me with all details!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'This ancient history is recited as an illustration of the<br>subject of the conquest by a householder, over Mrityu, through the<br>practice of virtue. The Prajapati Manu had a son, O king, of the name of<br>the Ikshwaku. Of that king, illustrious as Surya, were born a hundred<br>sons. His tenth son, O Bharata, was named Dasaswa, and this virtuous<br>prince of infallible prowess became the king of Mahismati. Dasaswa's son,<br>O king, was a righteous prince whose mind was constantly devoted to the<br>practice of truth and charity and devotion. He was known by the name of<br>Madiraswa and ruled over the Earth as her lord. He was constantly devoted<br>to the study of the Vedas as also of the science of arms. Madiraswa's son<br>was the king named Dyutimat who possessed great good fortune and power<br>and strength and energy. Dyutimat's son was the highly devout and pious<br>king who was famous in all the worlds under the name of Suvira. His soul<br>was intent on religion and he possessed wealth like another Indra, the<br>lord of the deities. Suvira too had a son who was invincible in battle,<br>and who was the best of all warriors and known by the name of Sudurjaya.<br>And Durjya too, possessed of a body like that of Indra, had a son who<br>beamed with splendour like that of fire. He was the great monarch named<br>Duryodhana who was one of the foremost of royal sages. Indra used to pour<br>rain profusely in the kingdom of this monarch, who never fled from the<br>battlefield and was possessed of valour like unto Indra himself. The<br>cities and the kingdom of this king were filled with riches and gems and<br>cattle and grain of various kinds. There was no miser in his kingdom nor<br>any person afflicted with distress or poverty. Nor was there in his<br>kingdom any person that was weak in body or afflicted with disease. That<br>king was very clever, smooth in speech, without envy, a master of his<br>passions, of a righteous soul, full of compassion, endued with prowess,<br>and not given to boasting. He performed sacrifices, and was<br>self-restrained and intelligent, devoted to Brahmanas and Truth. He never<br>humiliated others, and was charitable, and learned in the Vedas and the<br>Vedanta. The celestial river Narmada, auspicious and sacred and of cool<br>waters, in her own nature, O Bharata, courted him. He begot upon that<br>river, a lotus-eyed daughter, by name Sudarsana, who was, O king, endued<br>with great beauty. No creature, O Yudhisthira, had ever been born before<br>among womankind, that was, possessed of such beauty as that excellent<br>damsel who was the daughter of Duryodhana. The god Agni himself courted<br>the beautiful princess Sudarsana, and taking the shape of a Brahmana, O<br>monarch, sought her hand from the king. The king was unwilling to give<br>his daughter in marriage to the Brahmana who was poor and not of the same<br>rank with himself. Thereupon Agni vanished from his great sacrifice. The<br>king, grieved at heart, then addressed the Brahmanas, saying,&#8212;Of what<br>sin have I, ye excellent Brahmanas, or you, been guilty, that Agni should<br>disappear from this sacrifice, even as good done unto wicked men<br>disappears from their estimation. Great, indeed, must that sin of ours be<br>for which Agni has thus disappeared. Either must the sin be yours, or, it<br>must be mine. Do you fully investigate the matter.&#8212;Then hearing the<br>king's words, O foremost prince of Bharata's race, the Brahmanas,<br>restraining speech, sought with concentrated faculties the protection of<br>the god of fire. The divine carrier of oblations, resplendent as the<br>autumnal Sun, appeared before them, enveloping his self in glorious<br>refulgence. The high-souled Agni then addressed those excellent<br>Brahmanas, saying,&#8212;I seek the daughter of Duryodhana for my own self. At<br>this all those Brahmanas were struck with wonder, and rising on the<br>morrow, they related to the king what had been said by the fire-god. The<br>wise monarch, hearing the words of those utterers of Brahma, was<br>delighted at heart, and said,&#8212;Be it so.&#8212;The king craved a boon of the<br>illustrious fire-god as the marriage dower,&#8212;Do thou, O Agni, deign to<br>remain always with us here.&#8212;Be it so&#8212;said the divine Agni to that lord<br>of Earth. For this reason Agni has always been present in the kingdom of<br>Mahismati to this day, and was seen by Sahadeva in course of his<br>conquering expedition to the south. Then the king gave his daughter,<br>dressed in new garments and decked with jewels, to the high-souled deity,<br>and Agni too accepted, according to Vedic rites, the princess Sudarsana<br>as his bride, even as he accepts libations of clarified butter at<br>sacrifices, Agni was well pleased with her appearance, her beauty, grace,<br>character, and nobility of birth, and was minded to beget offspring upon<br>her. And a son by Agni, of the name of Sudarsana, was soon born of her.<br>Sudarsana also was, in appearance, as beautiful as the full moon, and<br>even in his childhood he attained to a knowledge of the supreme and<br>everlasting Brahma. There was also a king of the name of Oghavat, who was<br>the grandfather of Nriga. He had a daughter of the name of Oghavati, and<br>a son too of the name of Ogharatha born unto him. King Oghavat gave his<br>daughter Oghavati, beautiful as a goddess, to the learned Sudarsana for<br>wife. Sudarsana, O king, leading the life of a householder with Oghavati,<br>used to dwell in Kurukshetra with her. This intelligent prince of blazing<br>energy took the vow, O lord, of conquering Death by leading the life of<br>even a householder. The son of Agni, O king, said to Oghavati,&#8212;Do thou<br>never act contrary to (the wishes of) those that seek our hospitality.<br>Thou shouldst make no scruple about the means by which guests are to be<br>welcomed, even if thou have to offer thy own person. O beautiful one,<br>this vow is always present in the mind, since for householders, there is<br>no higher virtue than hospitality accorded to guests. Do thou always bear<br>this in mind without ever doubting it, if my words be any authority with<br>thee. O sinless and blessed one, if thou hast any faith in me, do thou<br>never disregard a guest whether I be at thy side or at a distance from<br>thee! Unto him, with hands clasped and placed on her head, Oghavati<br>replied, saying,&#8212;'I shall leave nothing undone of what thou commandest<br>me.&#8212;Then Mrityu, O king, desiring to over-reach Sudarsana, began to<br>watch him for finding out his lathes. On a certain occasion, when the son<br>of Agni went out to fetch firewood from the forest, a graceful Brahmana<br>sought the hospitality of Oghavati with these words:&#8212;O beautiful lady,<br>if thou hast any faith in the virtue of hospitality as prescribed for<br>householders, then I would request thee to extend the rites of<br>hospitality to me to-day.&#8212;The princess of great fame, thus addressed by<br>that Brahmana, O king, welcomed him according to the rites prescribed in<br>the Vedas. Having offered him a seat, and water to wash his feet, she<br>enquired, saying,&#8212;What is thy business? What can I offer thee? The<br>Brahmana said unto her,&#8212;My business is with thy person, O blessed one.<br>Do thou act accordingly without any hesitation in thy mind. If the duties<br>prescribed for householders be acceptable to thee, do thou, O princess,<br>gratify me by offering up thy person to me.&#8212;Though tempted by the<br>princess with offers of diverse other things, the Brahmana, however, did<br>not ask for any other gift than the offer of her own person. Seeing him<br>resolved, that lady, remembering the directions which had before been<br>given to her by her husband, but overcome with shame, said, to that<br>excellent Brahmana,&#8212;Be it so.&#8212;Remembering the words of her husband who<br>was desirous of acquiring the virtue of householders, she cheerfully<br>approached the regenerate Rishi. Meanwhile, the son of Agni, having<br>collected his firewood, returned to his home. Mrityu, with his fierce and<br>inexorable nature, was constantly by his side, even, as one attends upon<br>one's devoted friend. When the son of Pavaka returned to his own<br>hermitage, he called Oghavati by name, and (receiving no answer)<br>repeatedly, exclaimed,&#8212;Whether art thou gone?&#8212;But the chaste lady,<br>devoted to her husband, being then locked in the arms of that Brahmana,<br>gave no reply to her husband. Indeed, that chaste woman, considering<br>herself contaminated became speechless, overcome with shame. Sudarsana,<br>addressing her again, exclaimed,&#8212;Where can my chaste wife be? Whither<br>has she gone? Nothing can be of greater moment to me than this (her<br>disappearance). Why does not that simple and truthful lady, devoted to<br>her husband, alas, answer to my call today as she used to do before with<br>sweet smiles? Then that Brahmana, who was within the hut, thus replied to<br>Sudarsana,&#8212;Do thou learn, O son of Pavaka, that a Brahmana guest has<br>arrived, and though tempted by this thy wife with diverse other offers of<br>welcome, I have, O best of Brahmanas, desired only her person, and this<br>fair-faced lady is engaged in welcoming me with due rites. Thou art at<br>liberty to do whatever thou thinkest to be suitable to this occasion.<br>Mrityu, armed with the iron club, pursued the Rishi at that moment,<br>desirous of compassing the destruction of one that would, he thought,<br>deviate from his promise. Sudarsana was struck with wonder, but casting<br>off all jealousy and anger by look, word, deed, or thought, said,&#8212;Do<br>thou enjoy thyself, O Brahmana. It is a great pleasure to me. A<br>householder obtain the highest merit by honouring a guest. It is said by<br>the learned that, as regards the householder, there is no higher merit<br>than what results unto him from a guest departing from his house after<br>having been duly honoured by him. My life, my wife, and whatever other<br>worldly possessions I have, are all dedicated to the use of my guests.<br>Even this is the vow that I have taken. As I have truly made this<br>statement, by that truth, O Brahmana, I shall attain to the knowledge of<br>Self. O foremost of virtuous men, the five elements, viz., fire, air,<br>earth, water, and sky, and the mind, the intellect and the Soul, and time<br>and space and the ten organs of sense, are all present in the bodies of<br>men, and always witness the good and evil deeds that men do. This truth<br>has today been uttered by me, and let the gods bless me for it or destroy<br>me if I have spoken falsely. At this, O Bharata, there arose in all<br>directions, in repeated echoes, a voice, crying,&#8212;This is true, this is<br>not false. Then that Brahmana came out of the hovel, and like the wind<br>rising and encompassing both Earth and sky, and making the three worlds<br>echo with Vedic sounds, and calling that virtuous man by name, and<br>congratulating him said,&#8212;O sinless one, I am Dharma; All glory to thee.<br>I came here, O truth-loving one, to try thee, and I am well pleased with<br>thee by knowing thee to be virtuous. Thou hast subdued and conquered<br>Mrityu who always has pursued thee, seeking thy laches? O best of men, no<br>one in the three worlds has the ability to insult, even with looks, this<br>chaste lady devoted to her husband, far less to touch her person. She has<br>been protected from defilement by thy virtue and by her own chastity.<br>There can be nothing contrary to what this proud lady will say. This<br>utterer of Brahma, endued with austere penances, shall, for the salvation<br>of the world, be metamorphosed into a mighty river. And thou shalt attain<br>to all the worlds in this thy body, and as truly as the science of Yoga<br>is within her control, this highly blessed lady will follow thee with<br>only half of her corporeal self, and with the other half will she be<br>celebrated as the river Oghavati! And thou shalt attain with her to all<br>the worlds that acquired through penances, Those eternal and everlasting<br>worlds from which none cometh back will be attained by thee even in this<br>gross body of thine. Thou hast conquered Death, and attained to the<br>highest of all felicities, and by thy own power (of mind), attaining to<br>the speed of thought, thou hast risen above the power of the five<br>elements! By thus adhering to the duties of a householder, thou hast<br>conquered thy passions, desires, and anger, and this princess, O prince<br>of virtuous men has, by serving thee, conquered affliction, desire,<br>illusion, enmity and lassitude of mind!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Then the glorious Vasava (the lord of the gods),<br>riding in a fine chariot drawn by a thousand white horses, approached<br>that Brahmana. Death and Soul, all the worlds, all the elements,<br>intellect, mind, time, and space as also desire and wrath, were all<br>conquered. There-fore, O best of men, do thou bear this in mind, that to<br>a householder there is no higher divinity than the guest. It is said by<br>the learned that the blessings of an honoured guest are more efficacious<br>than the merit of a hundred sacrifices. Whenever a deserving guest seeks<br>the hospitality of a householder and is not honoured by him, he takes<br>away (with him) all the virtues of the latter giving him his sins (in<br>return). I have now recited to thee, my son, this excellent story as to<br>how Death was conquered of old by a householder. The recital of this<br>excellent story confers glory, fame, and longevity (upon those that<br>listen to it). The man that seeks worldly prosperity should consider it<br>as efficacious in removing all evil. And, O Bharata, the learned man that<br>daily recites this story of the life of Sudarsana attains to the regions<br>of the blessed.'"
