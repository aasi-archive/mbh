                            "The god of wind said, 'Once on a time, O king, a ruler of the name of<br>Anga desired to give away the whole earth as sacrificial present unto the<br>Brahmanas. At this, the earth became filled with anxiety. 'I am the<br>daughter of Brahman. I hold all creatures. Having obtained me, alas, why<br>does this foremost of kings wish to give me away unto the Brahmanas?<br>Abandoning my character as the soil, I shall now repair to the presence<br>of my sire. Let this king with all his kingdom meet with destruction?<br>Arrived at this conclusion, she departed for the region of Brahman The<br>Rishi Kasyapa, beholding goddess Earth on the point of departing, himself<br>immediately entered the visible embodiment of the goddess, casting off<br>his own body, by the aid of Yoga. The earth thus penetrated by the spirit<br>of Kasyapa, grew in prosperity and became full of all kinds of vegetable<br>produce. Indeed, O king for the time that Kasyapa pervaded the earth,<br>Righteousness became foremost everywhere and all fears ceased. In this<br>way, O king, the earth remained penetrated by the spirit of Kasyapa for<br>thirty thousand celestial years, fully alive to all those functions which<br>it used to discharge while it was penetrated by the spirit of Brahman's<br>daughter. Upon the expiry of this period, the goddess returned from the<br>region of Brahman and arrived here bowed unto Kasyapa and from that time<br>became the daughter of that Rishi, Kasyapa is a Brahmana. Even this was<br>the feat, O king, that a Brahmana did. Tell me the name of the Kshatriya<br>who can be held to be superior to Kasyapa! Hearing these words, king<br>Arjuna remained silent. Unto him the god of wind once more said, 'Hear<br>now, O king, the story of Utathya who was born in the race of Angiras.<br>The daughter of Soma, named Bhadra, came to be regarded as unrivalled in<br>beauty. Her sire Soma regarded Utathya to be the fittest of husbands for<br>her. The famous and highly blessed maiden of faultless limbs, observing<br>diverse vows, underwent the severest austerities from the desire of<br>obtaining Utathya for her lord. After a while, Soma's father Atri,<br>inviting Utathya to his house, bestowed upon him the famous maiden.<br>Utathya, who used to give away sacrificial presents in copious measure,<br>duly received the girl for his wife. It so happened, however, that the<br>handsome Varuna had, from a long time before, coveted the girl. Coming to<br>the woods where Utathya dwelt, Varuna stole away the girl when she had<br>plunged into the Yamuna for a bath. Abducting her thus, the Lord of the<br>waters took her to his own abode. That mansion was of a wonderful aspect.<br>It was adorned with six hundred thousand lakes. There is no mansion that<br>can be regarded more beautiful than that palace of Varuna. It was adorned<br>with many palaces and by the presence of diverse tribes of Apsaras and of<br>diverse excellent articles of enjoyment. There, within that palace, the<br>Lord of waters; O king, sported with the damsel. A little while after,<br>the fact of the ravishment of his wife was reported to Utathya. Indeed,<br>having heard all the facts from Narada, Utathya addressed' the celestial<br>Rishi, saying, 'Go, O Narada, unto Varuna and speak with due severity<br>unto him. Ask him as to why he has abducted my wife, and, indeed, tell<br>him in my name that he should yield her up. Thou mayst say to him<br>further, 'Thou are a protector of the worlds, O Varuna, and not a<br>destroyer! Why then hast thou abducted Utathya's wife bestowed upon him<br>by Soma?' Thus requested by Utathya, the celestial Rishi Narada repaired<br>to where Varuna was and addressing him, said, 'Do thou set free the wife<br>of Utathya. Indeed, why hast thou abducted her?' Hearing these words of<br>Narada, Varuna replied unto him, saying, 'This timid girl is exceedingly<br>dear to me. I dare not let her go!' Receiving this reply, Narada repaired<br>to Utathya and cheerlessly said, 'O great ascetic, Varuna has driven me<br>out from his house, seizing me by the throat. He is unwilling to restore<br>to thee thy spouse. Do thou act as thou pleasest.' Hearing these words of<br>Narada, Angiras became inflamed with wrath. Endued with wealth of<br>penances, he solidified the waters and drank them off, aided by his<br>energy. When all the waters were thus drunk off, the Lord of that element<br>became very cheerless with all his friends and kinsfolk. For all that, he<br>did not still give up Utathya's wife. Then Utathya, that foremost of<br>regenerate persons, filled with wrath, commanded Earth, saying, 'O<br>amiable one, do thou show land where there are at present the six hundred<br>thousand lakes.' At these words of the Rishi, the Ocean receded from the<br>spot indicated, and land appeared which was exceedingly sterile. Unto the<br>rivers that flowed through that region, Utathya said, 'O Saraswati, do<br>thou become invisible here. Indeed, O timid lady, leaving this region, go<br>thou to the desert! O auspicious goddess, let this region, destitute of<br>thee, cease to become sacred.' When that region (in which the lord of<br>waters dwelt) became dry, he repaired to Angiras, taking with him<br>Utathya's spouse, and made her over to him. Getting back his wife,<br>Utathya became cheerful. Then, O chief of the Haihaya race, that great<br>Brahmana rescued both the universe and the Lord of waters from the<br>situation of distress into which he had brought them. Conversant with<br>every duty, the Rishi Utathya of great energy, after getting back his<br>spouse, O king, said so unto Varuna, 'I have recovered my wife, O Lord of<br>waters, with the aid of my penances and after inflicting such distress on<br>thee as made thee cry aloud in anguish! Having said this, he went home,<br>with that wife of his. Even such, O king, was Utathya, that foremost of<br>Brahmanas. Shall I go on? Or, will you yet persist in thy opinion? What,<br>is there a Kshatriya that is superior to Utathya?'
