                            "The Rishis said, 'O wielder of Pinaka, O tearer of the eyes of Bhaga, O<br>thou that art worshipped by all the universe, we desire to hear the glory<br>of Vasudeva.'<br><br>"Maheswara said, 'Hari is superior to the Grandsire himself. He is the<br>Eternal Purusha. Otherwise called Krishna, he is endued with the<br>splendour of gold, and shines with effulgence like a second sun.<br>Possessed of ten arms, he is endued with great energy, and is the slayer<br>of the foes of the gods. Having a whorl on his breast, he has curly locks<br>of hair on his head. He is worshipped by all the deities. Brahman has<br>risen from his abdomen. I have sprung from his head, All the luminaries<br>in the firmament have sprung from his hair. From the bristles on his body<br>have sprung all the gods and Asuras. From his body have sprung the Rishis<br>as also all the eternal worlds. He is the veritable abode of the<br>Grandsire and the abode of all the gods besides. He is the Creator of<br>this whole Earth, and He is the Lord of the three worlds He is also the<br>Destroyer of all creatures mobile and immobile. He is verily the foremost<br>of all the deities. He is their master. He is the chastiser of all foes.<br>He is possessed of omniscience. He exists in everything. He is capable of<br>going everywhere. He is of universal extent (pervading as he does<br>everything). He is the Supreme Soul. He is the urger of all the senses.<br>He covers the universe. He is the Supreme Lord. There is nothing in the<br>three worlds that is superior to him. He is Eternal. He is the slayer of<br>Madhu, and is otherwise called Govinda. The giver of honours, He will<br>cause all the kings of Earth to be slain in battle, for achieving the<br>purposes of the deities, taking birth in a human form. The deities,<br>abandoned by Him, are unable to accomplish their purposes on earth.<br>Without obtaining him as their leader they cannot do anything. He is the<br>leader of all creatures and is adored by all the gods[582]. Within the<br>abdomen of this Master of the gods who is ever devoted to the<br>accomplishment of their purposes, of this one who is identical with<br>Brahma and who is always the refuge of the regenerate Rishis, resides<br>Brahma (the Grandsire). Indeed, the latter dwells happily in Hari's body<br>which is the abode. I myself, that am called Sarva, also reside happily<br>in that happy abode of mine. All the deities too reside in happiness in<br>His body. Endued with great effulgence, he has eyes that resemble the<br>petals of the lotus. Sri dwells within Him and He dwells always<br>associated with her. The bow called Saranga and the discus (called<br>Sudarsana) are his weapons, together with a sword. He has the enemy of<br>the snakes (viz., Garuda) sitting on his standard. He is distinguished by<br>excellent conduct, by purity (of both body and mind), by self-restraint,<br>by prowess, by energy, by the handsomest form, by tallness and<br>well-proportioned limbs, by patience, by sincerity, by affluence, by<br>compassion, by excellence of form, and by might. He shines, endued with<br>all celestial weapons of wonderful form and make. He has Yoga for his<br>illusion. He is possessed of a thousand eyes. He is free from every stain<br>or fault. He is high-minded. He is endued with heroism. He is an object<br>of pride with all his friends. He is dear to all his kinsmen and<br>relatives and they are dear to him. He is endued with forgiveness. He is<br>free from pride or egotism. He is devoted to the Brahmanas and is their<br>leader. He dispels the fears of all persons afflicted with fear. He<br>enhances the joys of all his friends. He is the refuge of all creatures.<br>He is ever engaged in protecting and cherishing the distressed. Possessed<br>of a thorough acquaintance with all the scriptures, and every kind of<br>affluence, He is worshipped by all beings. Con-versant with all duties,<br>He is a great benefactor of even enemies when they seek His protection.<br>Conversant with policy and endued with policy, He is an utterer of Brahma<br>and has all His senses under perfect control. For doing good to the<br>deities, Govinda will take birth in the race of the high-souled Manu.<br>Verily, endued with high intelligence, He will take birth in the<br>auspicious and righteous race of that Prajapati. Manu will have a son of<br>the name of Anga. After Anga will come Antardhaman. From Antardhaman will<br>spring Havirdhaman, that lord of all creatures, free from every stain.<br>Havirdhaman will have an illustrious son of the name of Rachinavarhi. He<br>will have ten sons having Prachetas for their first. Prachetas will have<br>a son named Daksha who will be regarded as a Prajapati. Daksha will beget<br>a daughter who will be named Dakshayani. From Dakshayani will spring<br>Aditya, and from Aditya will spring Manu. From Manu will spring a<br>daughter named Ila and a son to be named Sudyumna. Ila will have Vudha<br>for her husband, and from Vudha will spring Pururavas. From Pururavas<br>will spring Ayu. From Ayu will spring Nahusha, and Nahusha will beget a<br>son named Yayati. From Yayati will spring a mighty son of the name of<br>Yadu, Yadu will beget Kroshtri. Kroshtri will beget a mighty son to be<br>named Vrijinivat. From Vrijinivat will spring Ushadgu the unvanquished.<br>Ushadgu will beget a son of the name of Chitraratha. Chitraratha will<br>have a younger son of the name of Sura. Indeed, in the race of these<br>mighty men, of energy celebrated over all the world, possessed of<br>excellent conduct and diverse accomplishments, devoted to the performance<br>of sacrifices and pure in behaviour,&#8212;in the pure race honoured by the<br>Brahmanas, Sura will take his birth. He will be a foremost Kshatriya,<br>endued with great energy, and possessed of great fame. Sura, that giver<br>of honours, will beget a son, the spreader of his race, of the name of<br>Vasudeva, otherwise called Anakadundhuvi. Vasudeva will have a son of the<br>name of Vasudeva. He will have four hands. He will be exceedingly<br>liberal, and will honour the Brahmanas greatly. Identical with Brahma, he<br>will like and love the Brahmanas, and the Brahmanas will like and love<br>him, that scion of Yadu's race will liberate many kings immured in the<br>prison of the ruler of the Magadhas, after vanquishing that ruler named<br>Jarasandha in his capital buried among mountains. Endued with great<br>energy, he will be rich with the jewels and gems of all the rulers of the<br>earth. Indeed, in energy he will be unrivalled on earth, possessed of<br>great prowess, he will be the king of all kings of the earth. Foremost<br>among all the Surasenas, the puissant one, residing at Dwaraka, will rule<br>and protect the whole earth after vanquishing all her lords, conversant<br>as he will be with the science of polity. Assembling together, do ye all<br>adore Him, as ye adore the Eternal Brahman, with speech, floral wreaths,<br>and excellent incense and perfumes. He who wishes to see me or the<br>Grandsire Brahma should first see the illustrious Vasudeva of great<br>puissance, If He is seen I am seen, as also the Grandsire Brahman, that<br>foremost of all the gods. In this I do not deem there is any difference.<br>Know this, ye Rishis of ascetic wealth! That person with whom the<br>lotus-eyed Vasudeva becomes gratified, all the deities with Brahma<br>amongst them will also become gratified with. That man who will seek the<br>protection of Kesava will succeed in earning great achievements and<br>victory and Heaven. He will be an instructor in religion and duties, and<br>will earn, great religious merit. All persons conversant with religion<br>and duties should, with great alacrity, bow down unto that Lord of all<br>the gods. By adoring that puissant one, one will acquire great merit.<br>Endued with great energy, that god, with the desire of benefiting all<br>creatures, created millions of Rishis for the sake of righteousness.<br>Those millions of Rishis, thus created by that great Ordainer are no<br>residing on the mountains of Gandhamadana, headed by Sanatkumara and<br>engaged in the observance of penances. Hence, ye foremost of regenerate<br>ones, that foremost of all eloquent persons, the righteous Vasudeva<br>should be adored by all. The illustrious Hari, the puissant Narayana, is<br>verily, the foremost of all beings in Heaven. Adored, he adores, and<br>honoured he honours; unto them that make offerings to him, he makes<br>offerings in return. Worshipped, he worships in return, if seen always,<br>he sees the seers always. If one seeks His refuge and protection, He<br>seeks the seeker as his refuge in return. Ye foremost of all righteous<br>ones, if adored and worshipped, He adores and worships in return. Even<br>this is the high practice of the faultless Vishnu. Even this is the vow<br>that is practised by all righteous people, of that first of all deities,<br>that puissant Lord of all creatures. He is always worshipped in the<br>world. Verily, that Eternal Being is worshipped by even the deities.<br>Those persons that are devoted to Him with the steadiness of a vow become<br>liberated from calamity and fear in proportion to his devotion. The<br>regenerate ones should always worship Him in thought, word, and deed. The<br>son of Devaki should be seen by them with reverence and in order to see<br>Him with reverence they should address themselves to the performance of<br>penances. Ye foremost of ascetics, even this is the path that I show unto<br>you. By beholding Him, ye will have behold all the foremost of deities, I<br>too bow my head in reverence unto that Lord of the universe, that<br>Grandsire of all the worlds, that mighty and vast boar. By beholding Him<br>one beholds the Trinity. Ourselves, i.e., all the deities, reside in Him.<br>He will have an elder brother who will become known over all the world as<br>Vala. Having a plough for his weapon, in form he will look like a white<br>hill. In fact, he will be endued with might capable of uplifting the<br>whole earth. Upon the car of that divine person a tall palmyra,<br>three-headed and made of gold, will form his proud standard. The head of<br>that mighty-armed hero, that Lord of all the worlds, will be shaded by<br>many high-souled snakes of vast bodies. All weapons of attack and defence<br>will also come to him as soon as he will think of them. He is called<br>Ananta (Infinite) Verily, that illustrious one is identical with the<br>immutable Hari. Once on a time the mighty Garuda, the son of Kasyapa, was<br>addressed by the deities in these words, 'Do thou, O puissant one, see if<br>this one has any end!' Though possessed of great energy and might,<br>Garuda, however, failed to find out the end of this illustrious one who<br>is identical with the Supreme Soul. Supporting the whole earth on his<br>head, he resides in the nether regions. He roves through the universe as<br>Sesha, filled with great joy. He is Vishnu, He is the illustrious Ananta.<br>He is the supporter of the earth. He that is Rama is Hrishikesa. He that<br>is Achyuta is Ananta, the bearer of the earth. Both of those foremost of<br>all creatures are celestial and endued with celestial prowess. One of<br>them is armed with the discus and the other with the plough. They deserve<br>every honour and should be seen, I have, through my kindness for you,<br>have thus declared to you the nature of Vasudeva. Even this, ye ascetics<br>possessed of wealth of penances, is Righteousness, I have declared all<br>this to you so that ye may, with reverence and care, worship Krishna,<br>that foremost one of Yadu's race."
