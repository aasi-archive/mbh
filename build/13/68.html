                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Do thou discourse to me once again, O grandsire,<br>upon the merits attaching to gifts of sesame and of lamps for lighting<br>darkness, as also of food and robes.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection, O Yudhishthira, is recited the<br>narrative of the discourse that took place in ancient times between a<br>Brahmana and Yama. In the country lying between the rivers Ganga and<br>Yamuna, at the foot of the hills called Yamuna, there was a large town<br>inhabited by Brahmanas. The town was celebrated under the name of<br>Parnasala and was very delightful in appearance, O king. A large number<br>of learned Brahmanas lived in it. One day, Yama, the ruler of the dead,<br>commanded a messenger of his, who was clad in black, endued with<br>blood-red eyes and hair standing erect, and possessed of feet, eyes, and<br>nose all of which resembled those of a crow, saying, 'Go thou to the town<br>inhabited by Brahmanas and bring hither the person known by the name of<br>Sarmin and belonging by birth to the race of Agastya. He is intent on<br>mental tranquillity and possessed of learning. He is a preceptor engaged<br>in teaching the Vedas and his practices are well-known. Do not bring me<br>another person belonging to the same race and living in the same<br>neighbourhood. This other man is equal unto him I want, in virtues,<br>study, and birth. With respect to children and conduct, this other<br>resembles the intelligent Sarmin. Do thou bring the individual I have in<br>view. He should be worshipped with respect (instead of being dragged<br>hither with irreverence).' The messenger having come to the place, did<br>the very reverse of what he had been bidden to do. Attacking that person,<br>he brought him who had been forbidden by Yama to be brought. Possessed of<br>great energy, Yama rose up at the sight of the Brahmana and worshipped<br>him duly. The king of the dead then commanded his messenger, saying, 'Let<br>this one be taken back, and let the other one be brought to me.' When the<br>great judge of the dead said these words, that Brahmana addressed him and<br>said, 'I have completed my study of the Vedas and am no longer attached<br>to the world. Whatever period may yet remain of my mortal existence, I<br>wish to pass, dwelling even here, O thou of unfading glory![346]<br><br>"Yama said, 'I cannot ascertain the exact period, ordained by Time, of<br>one's life, and hence, unurged by Time, I cannot allow one to take up<br>one's residence here. I take note of the acts of righteousness (or<br>otherwise) that one does in the world. Do thou, O learned Brahmana of<br>great splendour return immediately to thy abode. 'I ell me what also is<br>in thy mind and what I can do for thee, O thou of unfading glory!'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'Do thou tell me what those acts are by accomplishing<br>which one may earn great merit. O best of all beings, thou art the<br>foremost of authorities (on the subject) even in the three worlds.'<br><br>"Yama said, 'Do thou hear, O regenerate Rishi, the excellent ordinances<br>regarding gifts. The gift of sesame seeds is a very superior one. It<br>produces everlasting merit. O foremost of regenerate ones, one should<br>make gifts of as much sesame as one can. By making gifts of sesame every<br>day, one is sure to attain the fruition of one's every wish. The gift of<br>sesame at Sraddhas is applauded. Verily the gift of sesame is a very<br>superior one. Do thou make gifts of sesame unto the Brahmanas according<br>to the rites ordained in the scriptures. One should on the day of the<br>full moon of the month of Vaisakha, make gilts of sesame unto the<br>Brahmanas. They should also be made to eat and to touch sesame on every<br>occasion that one can afford. They that are desirous of achieving what is<br>beneficial to them should, with their whole souls, do this in their<br>houses.[347] Without doubt, men should similarly make gifts of water and<br>establish resting places for the distribution of drinking water.[348] One<br>should cause tanks and lakes and wells to be excavated. Such acts are<br>rare in the world, O best of regenerate persons! Do thou always make<br>gifts of water. This act is fraught with great merit. O best of<br>regenerate persons, thou shouldst establish resting places along the<br>roads for the distribution of water. After one has eaten, the gift unto<br>one should especially be made of water for drink.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'After Yama had said these words unto him, the<br>messenger who had borne him from his abode conveyed him back to it. The<br>Brahmana, on his return, obeyed the instructions he had received. Having<br>thus conveyed him back to his abode the messenger of Yama fetched Sarmin<br>who had really been sought by Yama. Taking Sarmin unto him, he informed<br>his master. Possessed of great energy, the judge of the dead worshipped<br>that righteous Brahmana, and having conversed with him a while dismissed<br>him for being taken back to his abode. Unto him also Yama gave the same<br>instructions. Sarmin, too, coming back into the world of men, did all<br>that Yama had said. Like the gift of water, Yama, from a desire of doing<br>good to the Pitris, applauds the gift of lamps to light dark places.<br>Hence, the giver of a lamp for lighting a dark place is regarded as<br>benefiting the Pitris. Hence, O best of the Bharatas, one should always<br>give lamps for lighting dark spots. The giving of lamps enhances the<br>visual power of the deities, the Pitris, and one's own self.[349] It has<br>been said, O king, that the gift of gems is a very superior gift. The<br>Brahmana, who, having accepted a gift of gems, sells the same for<br>performing a sacrifice, incurs no fault. The Brahmana, who, having<br>accepted a gift of gems makes a gift of them unto Brahmanas. acquires<br>inexhaustible merit himself and confers inexhaustible merit upon him from<br>whom he had originally received them. Conversant with every duty Manu<br>himself has said that he, who, observant of proper restraints, earns<br>makes a gift of gems unto a Brahmana observant of proper restraints earns<br>inexhaustible merit himself and confers inexhaustible merit upon the<br>recipient. The man who is content with his own wedded wife and who makes<br>a gift of robes, earns an excellent complexion and excellent vestments<br>for himself. I have told thee, O foremost of men, what the merits are<br>that attach to gifts of kine, of gold, and the sesame agreeably to<br>deserve precepts of the Vedas and the scriptures One should marry and<br>raise offspring upon one's wedded wives. Of all acquisitions, O son of<br>Kuru's race, that of male issue is regarded as the foremost.'"
