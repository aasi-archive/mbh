                            "Bhishma said, 'After Nimi had acted in the way described above, all the<br>great Rishis began to perform the sacrifice in honour of the Pitris<br>(called the Sraddha) according to rites laid down in the ordinance.<br>Firmly devoted to the discharge of all duties, the Rishis, having<br>performed Sraddhas, began to also offer oblations (unto the Pitris) of<br>sacred waters, with attention. In consequence, however, of the offerings<br>made by persons of all classes (unto the Pitris), the Pitris began to<br>digest that food. Soon they, and the deities also with them, became<br>afflicted with indigestion. Indeed, afflicted with the heaps of food that<br>all persons began to give them, they repaired to the presence of Soma.<br>Approaching Soma they said, 'Alas, great is our affliction in consequence<br>of the food that is offered to us at Sraddhas. Do thou ordain what is<br>necessary for our ease.' Unto them Soma answered, saying, 'If, ye gods,<br>ye are desirous of obtaining ease, do ye repair then into the abode of<br>the Self-born. Even he will do what is for your good.' At these words of<br>Soma, the deities and the Pitris then proceeded, O Bharata, to the<br>Grandsire where he was seated on the summit of the mountains of Meru.'<br><br>"The deities, 'O illustrious one, with the food that is offered us in<br>sacrifices and Sraddhas, we are being exceedingly afflicted. O lord, show<br>us grace and do what would be for our good.' Hearing these words of<br>theirs, the Self-born said unto them in reply, 'Here, the god of fire is<br>sitting beside me, Even he will do what is for your benefit.'<br><br>"Agni said, 'Ye sires, when a Sraddha comes, we shall together eat the<br>offerings made to us. If ye eat those offerings with me, ye shall then,<br>without doubt, succeed in digesting them easily.' Hearing these words of<br>the deity of fire, the Pitris became easy of heart. It is for this reason<br>also that in making offerings at Sraddhas a share is first offered to the<br>deity of fire, O king. If a portion of the offerings be first made to the<br>deity of fire at a Sraddha, O prince of men, Rakshasas of regenerate<br>origin cannot then do any injury to such a Sraddha.[414] Beholding the<br>deity of fire at a Sraddha Rakshasas fly away from it. The ritual of the<br>Sraddha is that the cake should first be offered to the (deceased) sire.<br>Next, one should be offered to the grandsire. Next should one be offered<br>to the great-grandsire. Even this is the ordinance in respect of the<br>Sraddha. Over every cake that is offered, the offerer should, with<br>concentrated attention, utter the Savitri Mantras. This other Mantra also<br>should be uttered, viz., unto Soma who is fond of the Pitris. A woman<br>that has become impure in consequence of the advent of her season, or one<br>whose ears have been cut off, should not be allowed to remain where a<br>Sraddha is being performed. Nor should a woman (for cooking the rice to<br>be offered in the Sraddha) be brought from a Gotra other than that of the<br>person who is performing the Sraddha.[414] While crossing river, one<br>should offer oblations of water unto one's Pitris, naming them all.<br>Indeed, when one comes upon a river one should gratify one's Pitris with<br>oblations of water. Having offered oblations of water first unto the<br>ancestors of one's own race, one should next offer such oblations to<br>one's (deceased) friends and relatives. When one crosses a stream on a<br>car unto which is yoked a couple of oxen of variegated hue, or from them<br>that cross a stream on boats, the Pitris expect oblations of water. Those<br>that know this always offer oblations of water with concentrated<br>attention unto the Pitris, Every fortnight on the day of the New moon,<br>one should make offerings unto one's deceased ancestors. Growth,<br>longevity, energy, and prosperity become all attainable through devotion<br>to the Pitris. The Grandsire Brahman, Pulastya, Vasishtha, Pulaha,<br>Angiras, Kratu and the great Rishi Kasyapa&#8212;these, O prince of Kuru's<br>race, and regarded as great masters of Yoga. They are numbered among the<br>Pitris. Even this is the high ritual in respect of the Sraddha, O<br>monarch! Through Sraddhas performed on earth the deceased members of one<br>race become freed from a position of misery. I have thus, O prince of<br>Kuru's race, expounded to thee agreeably with the scriptures, the<br>ordinances in respect of Sraddhas. I shall once more discourse to thee on<br>gifts."
