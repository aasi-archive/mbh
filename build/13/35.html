                            "Bhishma said, 'O blessed king, Brahmana, by birth alone, becomes an<br>object of adoration with all creatures and are entitled, as guests, to<br>eat the first portion of all cooked food.[261] From them flow all the<br>great objects of life (viz., Righteousness and Wealth and Pleasure and<br>Emancipation). They are the friends of all creatures in the universe.<br>They are again the mouths of the deities (for food poured into their<br>mouths is eaten by the deities). Worshipped with reverence, they wish us<br>prosperity by uttering words fraught with auspiciousness. Disregarded by<br>our foes, let them be enraged with these, and let them wish evil unto<br>those detractors of theirs, uttering words fraught with severe curses. In<br>this connection, persons conversant with ancient history repeat the<br>following verses sung of old respecting how in ancient times the Creator,<br>after having created the Brahmanas, ordained their duties.&#8212;A Brahmana<br>should never do anything else than what has been ordained for him.<br>Protected, they should protect others. By conducting themselves in this<br>way, they are sure to attain to what is mightily advantageous for them.<br>By doing those acts that are ordained for them, they are sure to obtain<br>Brahma-prosperity. Ye shall become the exemplars of all creatures, and<br>reins for restraining them. A Brahmana possessed of learning should never<br>do that which is laid down for the Sudras. By doing such acts, a Brahmana<br>loses merit[262]. By Vedic study he is sure to obtain prosperity and<br>intelligence and energy and puissance competent to scorch all things, as<br>also glory of the most exalted kind. By offering oblations of clarified<br>butter unto the deities, the Brahmanas attain to high blessedness and<br>become worthy of taking the precedence of even children in the matter of<br>all kinds of cooked food, and endued with Brahma-prosperity.[263] Endued<br>with faith that is fraught with compassion towards all creatures, and<br>devoted to self-restraint and the study of the Vedas, ye shall attain to<br>the fruition of all your wishes. Whatever things exist in the world of<br>men, whatever things occur in the region of the deities, can all be<br>achieved acquired with the aid of penances and knowledge and the<br>observance of vows and restraints. I have thus recited to thee, O sinless<br>one, the verses that were sung by Brahma himself. Endued with supreme<br>intelligence and wisdom, the Creator himself ordained this, through<br>compassion for the Brahmanas. The puissance of those among them that are<br>devoted to penances is equal to the might of kings. They are verily<br>irresistible, fierce, possessed of the speed of lightning, and<br>exceedingly quick in what they do. There are amongst them those that are<br>possessed of the might of lions and those that are possessed of the might<br>of tigers. Some of them are endued with the might of boars, some with<br>that of the deer, and some with that of crocodiles. Some there are<br>amongst them whose touch resembles that of snakes of virulent poison, and<br>some whose bite resembles that of sharks. Some amongst them are capable<br>of compassing by speech alone the destruction of those that are opposed<br>to them; and some are competent to destroy by a glance only of their<br>eyes. Some, amongst them, as already said, are like snakes of virulent<br>poison, and some of them are possessed of very mild dispositions. The<br>dispositions, O Yudhisthira, of the Brahmanas, are of diverse kinds. The<br>Mekalas, the Dravidas, the Lathas, the Paundras, the Konwasiras, the<br>Saundikas, the Daradas, the Darvas, the Chauras, the Savaras, the<br>Varvaras, the Kiratas, the Yavanas, and numerous other tribes of<br>Kshatriyas, have become degraded into the status of Sudras through the<br>wrath of Brahmanas. In consequence of having disregarded the Brahmanas,<br>the Asuras have been obliged to take refuge in the depths of the ocean.<br>Through the grace of the Brahmanas, the deities have become denizens of<br>the happy regions of Heaven. The element of space or ether is incapable<br>of being touched. The Himavat mountains are incapable of being moved from<br>their site. The current of Ganga is incapable of being resisted by a dam.<br>The Brahmanas are incapable of being subjugated. Kshatriyas are incapable<br>of ruling the Earth without cultivating the good will of the Brahmanas.<br>The Brahmanas are high-souled beings. They are the deities of the very<br>deities. Do thou always worship them with gifts and obedient services:<br>if, indeed, thou wishest to enjoy the sovereignty of the whole Earth with<br>her belt of seas. The energy and might of Brahmanas, O sinless one,<br>become abated in consequence of the acceptance of gift. Thou shouldst<br>protect thy race. O king, from those Brahmanas that do not desire to<br>accept gifts!'"[264]<br><br><br><br>(Anusasana Parva Continued in Volume XI)
