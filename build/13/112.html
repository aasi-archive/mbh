                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast told me, O regenerate one, what the end is<br>of unrighteousness or sin. I desire now to hear, O foremost of speakers,<br>of what the end is of Righteousness. Having committed diverse acts of<br>sin, by what acts of people succeed in attaining to an auspicious end in<br>this world? By what acts also do people attain to an auspicious end in<br>heaven?'<br><br>"Vrihaspati said, 'By committing sinful acts with perverted mind, one<br>yields to the sway of unrighteousness and as a consequence goeth to hell.<br>That man who, having perpetrated sinful acts through stupefaction of<br>mind, feels the pangs of repentance and sets his heart on contemplation<br>(of the deity), has not to endure the consequences of his sins. One<br>becomes freed from one's sins in proportion as one repents for them. If<br>one having committed a sin, O king, proclaims it in the presence of<br>Brahmanas conversant with duties, one becomes quickly cleansed from the<br>obloquy arising from one's sin. Accordingly as one becomes cleansed<br>therefrom fully or otherwise, like a snake freed from his diseased<br>slough. By making, with a concentrated mind, gifts of diverse kinds unto<br>a Brahmana, and concentrating the mind (on the deity), one attains to an<br>auspicious end. I shall now tell thee what those gifts are, O<br>Yudhisthira, by making which a person, even if guilty of having committed<br>sinful acts, may become endued with merit. Of all kinds of gifts, that of<br>food is regarded as the best. One desirous of attaining to merit should,<br>with a sincere heart, make gifts of food. Food is the life-breath of men.<br>From it all creatures are born. All the worlds of living creatures are<br>established upon food. Hence food is applauded. The deities, Rishis,<br>Pitris, and men, all praise food. King Rantideva, in days of old,<br>proceeded to Heaven by making gifts of food. Food that is good and that<br>has been acquired lawfully, should be given, with a cheerful heart, unto<br>such Brahmanas as are possessed of Vedic lore. That man has never to take<br>birth in an intermediate order, whose food, given with a cheerful heart<br>is taken by a thousand Brahmanas. A person, O chief of men, by feeding<br>ten thousand Brahmanas, becomes cleansed of the piety and devoted to Yoga<br>practices. A Brahmana conversant with the Vedas, by giving away food<br>acquired by him as alms, unto a Brahmana devoted to the study of the<br>Vedas, succeeds in attaining to happiness here. That Kshatriya who,<br>without taking anything that belongs to a Brahmana, protects his subjects<br>lawfully, and makes gifts of food, obtained by the exercise of his<br>strength, unto Brahmanas foremost in Vedic knowledge, with concentrated<br>heart, succeeds by such conduct, O thou of righteous soul, in cleansing<br>himself, O son of Pandu, of all his sinful acts. That Vaisya who divides<br>the produce of his fields into six equal shares and makes a gift of one<br>of those shares unto Brahmanas, succeeds by such conduct in cleansing<br>himself from every sin. That Sudra who, earning food by hard labour and<br>at the risk of life itself, makes a gift of it to Brahmanas, becomes<br>cleansed from every sin. That man who, by putting forth his physical<br>strength, earns food without doing any act of injury to any creature, and<br>makes gift of it unto Brahmanas succeeds in avoiding all calamities. A<br>person by cheerfully making gifts of food acquired by lawful means unto<br>Brahmanas pre-eminent for Vedic lore, becomes cleansed of all his sins.<br>By treading in the path of the righteous one becomes freed from all sins.<br>A person by making gifts of such food as is productive of great energy,<br>becomes himself possessed of great energy. The path made by charitable<br>persons is always trod by those that are endued with wisdom. They that<br>make gifts of food are regarded as givers of life. The merit they acquire<br>by such gifts is eternal. Hence, a person should, under all<br>circumstances, seek to earn food by lawful means, and having earned to<br>make always gifts of it unto deserving men. Food is the great refuge of<br>the world of living creatures. By making gifts of food, one has never to<br>go to hell. Hence, one should always make gifts of food, having earned it<br>by lawful means. The householder should always seek to eat after having<br>made a gift of food unto a Brahmana. Every man should make the day<br>fruitful by making gifts of food.[518] A person by feeding, O king, a<br>thousand Brahmanas all of whom are conversant with duties and the<br>scriptures and the sacred histories, has not to go to Hell and to return<br>to this world for undergoing rebirths. Endued with the fruition of every<br>wish, he enjoys great felicity hereafter. Possessed of such merit, he<br>sports in happiness, freed from every anxiety, possessed of beauty of<br>form and great fame and endued with wealth. I have thus told thee all<br>about the high merit of gifts of food. Even this is the root of all<br>righteousness and merit, as also of all gifts, O Bharata!'"
