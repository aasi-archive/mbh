                            "Vaisampayana said, 'After Krishna, the son of Devaki, had said these<br>words, Yudhishthira once more asked Bhishma the son of Santanu, saying,<br>'O thou of great intelligence; O foremost of all persons conversant with<br>duties, which, indeed, of the two, direct perception and the scriptures,<br>is to be regarded as authority for arriving at a conclusion?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I think, there is no doubt in this. Listen to me, O thou<br>of great wisdom! I shall answer thee. The question thou hast asked is<br>certainly proper. It is easy to cherish doubt. But the solution of that<br>doubt is difficult. Innumerable are the instances, in respect of both<br>direct perception and audition (or the scriptures), in which doubts may<br>arise. Certain persons, who delight in the name of logicians, verily<br>imagining themselves to be possessed of superior wisdom, affirm that<br>direct perception is the only authority. They assert that nothing,<br>however true, is existent which is not directly perceivable; or, at least<br>they doubt the existence of those objects. Indeed, such assertions<br>involve an absurdity and they who make them are of foolish understanding,<br>whatever may be their pride of learning. If, on the other hand, thou<br>doubtest as to how the one (indivisible Brahman) could be the cause, I<br>answer that one would understand it only after a long course of years and<br>with the assistance of Yoga practised without idleness. Indeed, O<br>Bharata, one that lives according to such means as present themselves<br>(without, i.e., one's being wedded to this or that settled mode of life),<br>and one that is devoted (to the solution of the question), would be<br>capable of understanding it. None else, truly, is competent for<br>comprehending it. When one attains to the very end of reasons (or<br>reasoning processes), one then attains to that excellent and all<br>comprehending knowledge&#8212;that vast mass of effulgence which illumines all<br>the universe (called Brahma). That knowledge, O king, which is derived<br>from reason (or inferences) can scarcely be said to be knowledge. Such<br>knowledge should be rejected. It should be noted that it is not defined<br>or comprehended by the word. It should, therefore, be rejected!'"[619]<br><br>"Yudhisthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, which among these (four) is<br>most authoritative, viz., direct perception, inference from observation,<br>the science of Agama or scriptures, and diverse kinds of practices that<br>distinguish the good.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'While Righteousness is sought to be destroyed by wicked<br>persons possessed of great might, it is capable of being protected for<br>the time being by those that are good exerting themselves with care and<br>earnestness. Such protection, however, avails not in the long run, for<br>destruction does overtake Righteousness at the end. Then, again,<br>Righteousness often proves a mask for covering Unrighteousness, like<br>grass and straw covering the mouth of a deep pit and concealing it from<br>the view. Hear, again, O Yudhisthira! In consequence of this, the<br>practices of the good are interfered with and destroyed by the wicked.<br>Those persons who are of evil conduct, who discard the Srutis&#8212;indeed,<br>those wicked wights who are haters of Righteousness,&#8212;destroy that good<br>course of conduct (which could otherwise be set up as a standard). Hence,<br>doubts attach to direct perception, inference, and good conduct.[620]<br>Those, therefore, among the good that are possessed of understanding born<br>of (or cleansed by) the scriptures and that are ever contented, are to be<br>regarded as the foremost. Let those that are anxious and deprived of<br>tranquillity of soul, approach these. Indeed, O Yudhishthira., do thou<br>pay court to them and seek of them the solutions of thy doubt![621]<br>Disregarding both pleasure and wealth which always follow cupidity and<br>awakened into the belief that only Righteousness should be sought, do<br>thou, O Yudhishthira, wait upon and ask those persons (for enlightening<br>thyself). The conduct of those persons never goes wrong or meets with<br>destruction, as also their sacrifices and Vedic study and rites. Indeed,<br>these three, viz., conduct as consisting of overt acts, behaviour in<br>respect of (mental) purity, and the Vedas together constitute<br>Righteousness.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, my understanding is once more stupefied<br>by doubt. I am on this side the ocean, employed in searching after the<br>means of crossing it. I do not, however, behold the other shore of the<br>ocean! If these three, viz., the Vedas, direct perception (or acts that<br>are seen), and behaviour (or, mental purity) together constitute what is<br>to be regarded as authority, it can be alleged that there is difference<br>between them. Righteousness then becomes really of three kinds, although<br>it is one and indivisible.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Righteousness is sometimes seen to be destroyed by wicked<br>wights of great power. If thou thinkest, O king, that Righteousness<br>should really be of three kinds, my reply is that thy conclusion is<br>warranted by reason. The truth is that Righteousness is one and<br>indivisible, although it is capable of being viewed from three different<br>points. The paths (indications) of those three that constitute the<br>foundation of Righteousness have each been laid down. Do thou act<br>according to the instructions laid down. Thou shouldst never wrangle<br>about Righteousness and then seek to have those doubts solved into which<br>thou mayst arrive. O chief of the Bharatas, let no doubts like these ever<br>take possession of thy mind! Do thou obey what I say without scruple of<br>any kind. Follow me like a blind man or like one who, without being<br>possessed of sense himself, has to depend upon that of another.<br>Abstention from injury, truth, absence of wrath (or forgiveness), and<br>liberality of gifts,&#8212;these four, O king, that hast no foe, do thou<br>practise, for these four constitute eternal Righteousness! Do thou also,<br>O mighty-armed prince, pursue that conduct towards the Brahmanas which is<br>consistent with what has been observed towards them by thy sires and<br>grandsires. These are the principal indications of Righteousness. That<br>man of little intelligence who would destroy the weight of authority by<br>denying that to be a standard which has always been accepted as such<br>would himself fail to become an authority among men. Such a man becomes<br>the cause of much grief in the world. Do thou reverence the Brahmanas and<br>treat them with hospitality. Do thou always serve them in this way. The<br>universe rests on them. Do thou understand them to be such!'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, what the respective ends are<br>of those that hate Righteousness and of those that adore and observe it!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Those men that hate Righteousness are said to have their<br>hearts overwhelmed by the attributes of passion and darkness. Such men<br>have always to go to Hell. Those men, on the other hand, O monarch, who<br>always adore and observe Righteousness, those men who are devoted to<br>truth and sincerity, are called good. They always enjoy the pleasures or<br>felicity of heaven. In consequence of their waiting upon their preceptors<br>with reverence their hearts always turn towards Righteousness. Verily,<br>they who adore Righteousness attain to the regions of the deities. Those<br>individuals, whether human beings or deities who divest themselves of<br>cupidity and malice and who emaciate or afflict their bodies by the<br>observance of austerities, succeed, in consequence of the Righteousness<br>which then becomes theirs to attain to great felicity. Those that are<br>gifted with wisdom have said that the Brahmanas, who are the eldest sons<br>of Brahmana, represent Righteousness. They that are righteous always<br>worship them, their hearts regarding them with as much love and affection<br>as a hungry man's stomach entertains for ripe and delicious fruits.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'What is the appearance presented by those that are<br>wicked, and what are those acts which they that are called good are to<br>do? Explain to me this, O holy one! Indeed, tell me what the indications<br>are of the good and the wicked.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'They that are wicked are evil in their practices,<br>ungovernable or incapable of being kept within the restraints of rules,<br>and foul mouthed. They, on the other hand, they are good, are always good<br>in their acts. Verily, the acts these men do are regarded as the<br>indications of that course of conduct which is called good. They that are<br>good or righteous, O monarch, never answer the two calls of nature on the<br>public road, or in the midst of a cow-pen, or on a field of paddy, After<br>feeding the five they take their own food.[622] They never talk while<br>eating, and never go to sleep with wet hands (i.e., without rubbing them<br>dry with towels or napkins). Whenever they see any of the following, they<br>circumambulate them for showing them reverence, viz., a blazing fire, a<br>bull, the image of a deity, a cow-pen, a place where four roads meet, and<br>an old and virtuous Brahmana. They give the way, themselves standing<br>aside, unto those that are old, those that are afflicted with burdens,<br>ladies, those that hold high appointments in the village or town<br>administration, Brahmanas, kine, and kings. The righteous or good man is<br>he that protects his guests, servants and other dependents, his own<br>relatives, and all those that seek his protection. Such a man always<br>welcomes these with the usual enquiries of politeness. Two times have<br>been appointed by the deities for human beings to take their food, viz.,<br>morning and evening. During the interval one should not eat anything. By<br>following this rule about eating, one is said to observe a fast. As the<br>sacred fire waits for libations to be poured upon it when the hour for<br>Homa arrives, even so a woman, when her functional period is over,<br>expects an act of congress with her husband. One that never approaches<br>one's spouses at any other time save after the functional period, is said<br>to observe the vow of Brahmacharya. Amrita (nectar), Brahmanas, and<br>kine,&#8212;these three are regarded as equal. Hence, one should always<br>worship, with due rites, Brahmanas and kine. One does not incur any fault<br>or stain by eating the meat of animals slain in sacrifices with the aid<br>of Tantras from the Yajur Veda. The flesh of the back-bone, or that of<br>animals not slain in sacrifice, should be avoided even as one avoids the<br>flesh of one's own son. One should never cause one's guest to go without<br>food whether when one resides in one's own country or in a foreign land.<br>After completing one's study one should present the Dakshina unto one's<br>preceptor. When one sees one's preceptor, one should congratulate him<br>with reverence and worshipping him present him a seat. By worshipping<br>one's preceptor, one increases the period of one's life as also one's<br>fame and prosperity. One should never censure the old, nor send them on<br>any business[623]. One should never be seated when any one that is old is<br>standing. By acting in this way one protects the duration of one's life.<br>One should never cast one's eyes on a naked woman, nor a naked man. One<br>should never indulge in sexual congress except in privacy. One should eat<br>also without being seen by others. Preceptors are the foremost of<br>Tirthas; the heart is the foremost of all sacred objects; knowledge is<br>the foremost of all objects of search; and contentment is the foremost of<br>all happiness. Morning and evening one should listen to the grave<br>counsels of those that are aged. One attains to wisdom by constant<br>waiting upon those that are venerable for years. While reading the Vedas<br>or employed in eating, one should use one's right hand. One should always<br>keep one's speech and mind under thorough control, as also one's senses.<br>With well-cooked frumenty, Yavaka, Krisara, and Havi (clarified butter),<br>one should worship the Pitris and the deities in the Sraddha called<br>Ashtaka. The same should be used in worshipping the Planets. One should<br>not undergo a shave without calling down a blessing upon oneself. If one<br>sneezes, one should be blessed by those present. All that are ill or<br>afflicted with disease, should be blessed. The extension of their lives<br>should be prayed for.[624] One should never address an eminent person<br>familiarly (by using the word Twam). Under even the great difficulties<br>one should never do this. To address such a person as Twam and to slay<br>him are equal, persons of learning are degraded by such a style of<br>address. Unto those that are inferior, or equal, or unto disciples, such<br>a word can be used. The heart of the sinful man always proclaims the sins<br>he has committed. Those men who have deliberately committed sins meet<br>with destruction by seeking to conceal them from the good. Indeed, they<br>that are confirmed sinners seek to conceal their sinful acts from<br>others.[625] Such persons think that their sins are witnessed by neither<br>men nor the deities. The sinful man, overwhelmed by his sins, takes birth<br>in a miserable order of being. The sins of such a man continually grow,<br>even as the interest the usurer charge (on the loans he grants) increase<br>from day to day. If, having committed a sin, one seeks to have it covered<br>by righteousness, that sin becomes destroyed and leads to righteousness<br>instead of other sins.[626] If a quantity of water be poured upon salt,<br>the latter immediately dissolves away. Even so when expiation is<br>performed, sin dissolves away. For these reasons one should never conceal<br>a sin. Concealed, it is certain to increase. Having committed a sin, one<br>should confess it in the presence of those that are good. They would<br>destroy it immediately. If one does not enjoy in good time what one has<br>stored with hope, the consequence is that the stored wealth finds another<br>owner after the death of him who has stored it. The wise have said that<br>the mind of every creature is the true test of Righteousness. Hence, all<br>creatures in the world have an innate tendency to achieve Righteousness.<br>One should achieve Righteousness alone or single-handed. Verily, one<br>should not proclaim oneself Righteous and walk with the standard of<br>Righteousness borne aloft for purpose of exhibition. They are said to be<br>traders in Righteousness who practise it for enjoying the fruits it<br>brings about. One should adore the deities without giving way to<br>sentiments of pride. Similarly, one should serve one's preceptor without<br>deceit. One should make arrangements for securing to oneself invaluable<br>wealth in the hereafter which consists in gifts made here to deserving<br>persons.'"
