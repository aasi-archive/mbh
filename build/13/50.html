                            "Yudhishthira said, 'What is the nature of the compassion or pity that is<br>felt at the sight of another's woe? What is the nature of that compassion<br>or sympathy that one feels for another in consequence of one's living in<br>the companionship of that other? What is the nature (and degree) of the<br>high blessedness that attaches to kine? It behoveth thee, O grandsire, to<br>expound all this to me.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'I shall, in this connection, O thou of great effulgence,<br>recite to thee an ancient narrative of a conversation between Nahusha and<br>the Rishi Chyavana. In days of yore O Chief of Bharata's race, the great<br>Rishi Chyavana of Bhrigu's race, always observant of high vows, became<br>desirous of leading for some time the mode of life called Udavasa and set<br>himself to commence it. Casting off pride and wrath and joy and grief,<br>the ascetic, pledging himself to observe that vow, set himself to live<br>for twelve years according to the rules of Udavasa. The Rishi inspired<br>all creatures with a happy trust. And he inspired similar confidence in<br>all creatures living in water. The puissant ascetic resembled the Moon<br>himself in his behaviour to all. Bowing unto all the deities and having<br>cleansed himself of all sins, he entered the water at the confluence of<br>the Ganga and the Yamuna, and stood there like an inanimate post of wood.<br>Placing his head against it, he bore the fierce and roaring current of<br>the two streams united together,&#8212;the current whose speed resembled that<br>of the wind itself. The Ganga and the Yamuna, however, and the other<br>streams and lakes, whose waters unite together at the confluence at<br>Prayaga, instead of afflicting the Rishi, went past him (to show him<br>respect). Assuming the attitude of a wooden post, the great Muni<br>sometimes laid himself down in the water and slept at ease. And<br>sometimes, O chief of Bharata's race, the intelligent sage stood in an<br>erect posture. He became quite agreeable unto all creatures living in<br>water. Without the least fear, all these used to smell the Rishi's lips.<br>In this way, the Rishi passed a long time at that grand confluence of<br>waters. One day some fishermen came there. With nets in their hands, O<br>thou of great effulgence, those men came to that spot where the Rishi<br>was. They were many in number and all of them were bent upon catching<br>fish. Well-formed and broad-chested, endued with great strength and<br>courage and never returning in fear from water, those men who lived upon<br>the earnings by their nets, came to that spot, resolved to catch fish.<br>Arrived at the water which contained many fish, those fishermen, O chief<br>of the Bharatas, tied all their nets together. Desirous of fish, those<br>Kaivartas, many in number united together and surrounded a portion of the<br>waters of the Ganga and the Yamuna with their nets. Indeed, they then<br>cast into water their net which was made of new strings, capable of<br>covering a large space, and endued with sufficient length and breadth.<br>All of them, getting into the water, then began to drag with great force<br>that net of theirs which was very large and had been well-spread over a<br>large space. All of them were free from fear, cheerful, and fully<br>resolved to do one another's bidding. They had succeeded in enmeshing a<br>large number of fish and other aquatic animals. And as they dragged their<br>net, O king, they easily dragged up Chyavana the son of Bhrigu along with<br>a large number of fish. His body was overgrown with the river moss. His<br>beard and matted locks had become green. And all over his person could be<br>seen conchs and other molluscs attached with their heads. Beholding that<br>Rishi who was well-conversant with the Vedas dragged up by them from<br>water, all the fishermen stood with joined palms and then prostrated<br>themselves on the ground and repeatedly bent their heads. Through fear<br>and pain caused by the dragging of the net, and in consequence of their<br>being brought upon land, the fish enmeshed in the net yielded up their<br>lives. The ascetic, beholding that great slaughter of fishes, became<br>filled with compassion and sighed repeatedly.'<br><br>"The fishermen said, 'We have committed this sin (of dragging thy sacred<br>self from water) through ignorance. Be gratified with us! What wish of<br>thine shall we accomplish? Command us, O great ascetic!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'This addressed by them, Chyauana, from among that<br>heap of fishes around him, said, 'Do ye with concentrated attention hear<br>what my most cherished wish is. I shall either die with these fishes or<br>do ye sell me with them. I have lived with them for a long time within<br>the water. I do not wish to abandon them at such a time.' When he said<br>these words unto them, the fishermen became exceedingly terrified. With<br>pale faces they repaired to king Nahusha and informed him of all that had<br>taken place.'"
