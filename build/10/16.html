                            Vaishampayana said, "Understanding that that weapon was thrown (into the<br>wombs of the Pandava women) by Drona's son of sinful deeds, Hrishikesha,<br>with a cheerful heart, said these words unto him: A certain brahmana of<br>pious vows, beholding Virata's daughter who is now daughter-in-law to<br>Arjuna, while she was at Upaplavya, said, "While the Kuru line will<br>become extinct, a son will be born to thee. This thy son for that reason,<br>will be called by the name of Parikshit." The words of that pious man<br>shall become true: the Pandavas shall have a son called Parikshit. Unto<br>Govinda, that foremost one of the Satvata race, while he was saying these<br>words, Drona's son, filled with wrath, replied, saying, This, O Keshava,<br>that thou sayest from thy partiality for the Pandavas, shall not happen.<br>O thou of eyes like lotus-petals, my words cannot but be fulfilled.<br>Uplifted by me, this weapon of mine shall fall on the foetus that is in<br>the womb of Virata's daughter, upon that foetus which thou, O Krishna,<br>art desirous of protecting.'<br><br>The holy one said, "The fall of this mighty weapon will not be fruitless.<br>The foetus will die. But being dead, it will live again and have a long<br>life! As regards thyself, all wise men know thee for a coward and a<br>sinful wretch! Always engaged in sinful acts, thou art the slayer of<br>children. For this reason, thou must have to bear the fruit of these thy<br>sins. For 3,000 years thou shalt wander over this earth, without a<br>companion and without being able to talk with anyone. Alone and without<br>anybody by thy side, thou shalt wander through diverse countries, O<br>wretch, thou shalt have no place in the midst of men. The stench of pus<br>and blood shall emanate from thee, and inaccessible forests and dreary<br>moors shall be thy abode! Thou shalt wander over the Earth, O thou of<br>sinful soul, with the weight of all diseases on thee.<br><br>The heroic Parikshit, attaining to age and a knowledge of the Vedas and<br>the practice of pious vows, shall obtain all weapons from the son of<br>Sharadvata. Having obtained a knowledge of all high weapons, and<br>observant of all kshatriya duties, that righteous-souled king shall rule<br>the earth for sixty years. More than this, that boy shall become the<br>mighty-armed king of the Kurus, known by the name of Parikshit, before<br>thy very eyes, O thou of wicked soul! Though burnt by the energy of thy<br>weapon's fire, I shall revive him. O lowest of men, behold the energy of<br>my austerities and my truth."<br><br>Vyasa said, "Since, disregarding us, thou hast perpetrated this<br>exceedingly cruel act, and since thy behaviour is such although thou art<br>a good brahmana (by birth), therefore, those excellent words that<br>Devaki's son has said, will, without doubt, be realised in thy case, an<br>adopter as thou hast been of kshatriya usages!"<br><br>Ashvatthama said, "With thyself among all men, O holy one, I shall live!<br>Let the words of this illustrious and foremost of men become true!"<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "Drona's son, then, having made over his gem to<br>the high-souled Pandavas, cheerlessly proceeded, before their eyes, to<br>the forest. The Pandavas who had killed and chastised all their foes,<br>placed Govinda and the island-born Krishna and the great ascetic Narada<br>at their head, and taking the gem that was born with Ashvatthama, quickly<br>came back to the intelligent Draupadi who was sitting in observance of<br>the praya vow.<br><br>Those tigers among men, borne by their excellent steeds resembling the<br>wing in fleetness, came back with him of Dasharha's race to their<br>encampment. Speedily alighting from their cars, those great car-warriors,<br>themselves much more afflicted, beheld, Drupada's daughter Krishna<br>afflicted with woe. Approaching the cheerless princess stricken with<br>sorrow and grief, the Pandavas with Keshava, sat round her.<br><br>Then the mighty Bhimasena, desired by the king, gave that celestial gem<br>unto her and said these words: "This gem, O amiable lady, is thine. The<br>slayer of thy sons hath been vanquished. Rise, casting off thy sorrow,<br>and recollect the duties of a kshatriya lady. O thou of black eyes, when<br>Vasudeva was about to set out (from Upaplavya) on his mission of peace,<br>thou hadst, O timid lady, said even these words unto the slayer of Madhu,<br>"I have no husbands! I have no sons, nor brothers! Nor art thou alive, O<br>Govinda, since the king desires for peace!" Those bitter words were<br>addressed by thee to Krishna, that foremost of persons! It behoveth thee<br>to recollect those words of thine that were so consistent with kshatriya<br>usages.<br><br>The wretched Duryodhana, that obstacle on the way of our sovereignty, has<br>been slain. I have quaffed the blood of the living Duhshasana. We have<br>paid off the debt we owed to our enemy. People, while talking, will not<br>be able to censure us any longer. Having vanquished Drona's son, we have<br>set him free for the sake of his being a brahmana and of the respect that<br>should be shown to our deceased preceptor. His fame hath been destroyed,<br>O goddess, only his body remains! He has been divested of his gem and on<br>earth he has been reft of his weapons!"<br><br>Draupadi said, "I desired to only pay off our debt for the injury we have<br>sustained. The preceptor's son is worthy of my reverence as the preceptor<br>himself. Let the king bind this gem on his head, O Bharata!" The king<br>then, taking that gem, placed it on his head, at the desire of Draupadi<br>and regarding it as a gift from the preceptor. Holding on his head that<br>excellent and celestial gem, the puissant king looked beautiful like a<br>mountain with the moon above it. Though stricken with grief on account of<br>the death of her sons, the princess Draupadi, possessed of great mental<br>strength, gave up her vow. Then king Yudhishthira enquired of the<br>mighty-armed Krishna, saying the following words."
