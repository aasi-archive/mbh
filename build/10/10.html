                            Vaishampayana said, "After that night had gone away, the driver of<br>Dhrishtadyumna's car gave intelligence to king Yudhishthira of the great<br>slaughter that had been caused during the hour of sleep.<br><br>The driver said, "The sons of Draupadi, O king, have been slain, with all<br>the children of Drupada himself, while they were heedless and trustfully<br>asleep in their own camp! During the night, O king, thy camp has been<br>exterminated by the cruel Kritavarma, and Kripa, the son of Gautama, and<br>the sinful Ashvatthama! Slaying thousands of men and elephants and steeds<br>with lances and darts and battle-axes, those men have exterminated thy<br>army. While thy army was being slaughtered like a forest cut down with<br>axes, a loud wail was heard rising from thy camp. I am the sole survivor,<br>O monarch, of that vast force. I have, O thou of virtuous soul, escaped<br>with difficulty from Kritavarma at a time when he was heedless!"<br><br>Hearing these evil tidings, Kunti's son Yudhishthira, however, capable of<br>bearing up (against foes), fell down on the earth, afflicted with grief<br>at the loss of his sons. Advancing forward, Satyaki held the king in his<br>embrace. Bhimasena and Arjuna and the two sons of Madri also stretched<br>forth their arms. Having recovered his senses, the son of Kunti lamented<br>in great affliction, uttering these words rendered indistinct by sorrow:<br>"Alas, having vanquished the foe, we have ourselves been vanquished in<br>the end! The course of events is difficult to be ascertained even by<br>persons endued with spiritual sight. The foes, who were vanquished have<br>become victorious! Ourselves, again, while victorious, are vanquished!<br>Having slain brothers and friends and sires and sons and well-wishers,<br>and kinsmen, and counsellors, and having vanquished them all, we<br>ourselves are vanquished at last! Misery looks like prosperity and<br>prosperity looks like misery! This our victory has assumed the shape of<br>defeat. Our victory, therefore, has ended in defeat! Having won the<br>victory, I am obliged to grieve as an afflicted wretch. How, then, can I<br>regard it as a victory? In reality, I have been doubly defeated by the<br>foe. They for whose sake we have incurred the sin of victory by slaying<br>our kinsmen and friends, alas, they, after victory had crowned them, have<br>been vanquished by defeated foes that were heedful!<br><br>Alas, through heedlessness have they been slain that had escaped from<br>even Karna, that warrior who had barbed arrows and nalikas for his teeth,<br>the sword for his tongue, the bow for his gaping mouth, and the twang of<br>the bowstring and the sound of palms for his roars&#8212;that angry Karna who<br>never retreated from battle, and who was a very lion among men! Alas,<br>those princes that succeeded in crossing, by boats constituted by their<br>own excellent weapons, the great Drona-ocean having cars for its deep<br>lakes, showers of arrows for its waves, the ornaments of warriors for its<br>gems, car-steeds for its animals, darts and swords for its fishes,<br>elephants for its alligators, bows for its whirlpools, mighty weapons for<br>its foam, and the signal of battle for its moonrise causing it to swell<br>with energy, and the twang of the bowstring and the sound of palms for<br>its roar,&#8212;alas, even those princes have from heedlessness been slain!<br><br>There is, in this world, no more powerful cause of death, as regards men,<br>than heedlessness! Prosperity abandons a heedless man from every side,<br>and every kind of misery overtakes him. The tall standard with excellent<br>top that stood on his car was the wreath of smoke that infallibly<br>indicated the Bhishma-fire. Shafts constituted its flames, and wrath was<br>the wind that fanned it! The twang of his formidable bow and the sound of<br>his palms constituted the roar of that fire. Armour and diverse kinds of<br>weapons were the homa libations that were poured into it. The vast<br>hostile army was the heap of dry forest-grass that was assailed by that<br>fire. Alas, even they that had endured that fierce fire whose terrible<br>energy was represented by the mighty weapons in Bhishma's hand have at<br>last fallen through heedlessness.<br><br>A heedless person can never acquire knowledge, asceticism, prosperity, or<br>great renown. Behold, Indra has obtained great happiness after slaying<br>all his foes heedfully. Behold the survivors among our foes have, through<br>our heedlessness, slain so many sons and grandsons of kings, each of whom<br>was really like Indra himself. Alas, they have perished like merchants<br>with rich freight perishing through carelessness in a shallow stream<br>after having crossed the great ocean. They whose bodies are now lying on<br>the bare ground, slain by those vindictive wretches, have without doubt<br>ascended to heaven.<br><br>I grieve, however, for the princess Krishna. Alas, she will be plunged<br>today in an ocean of grief. Hearing of the slaughter of her brothers and<br>sons and her venerable sire, the king of the Pancalas, without doubt she<br>will fall down senseless on the earth. Her body emaciated by grief, she<br>will not rise again. Unable to bear the grief resulting from such<br>affliction, and worthy as she is of happiness, alas, what will be her<br>plight? Cut to the quick by the slaughter of her sons and brothers, she<br>will be like one scorched by fire.'<br><br>Having in deep affliction indulged in these lamentations, that king of<br>Kuru's race then addressed Nakula, saying, Go and bring the unfortunate<br>princess Draupadi here along with all her maternal relations.' Obediently<br>accepting that command of the king who equalled Yama himself in<br>righteousness, Nakula speedily proceeded on his car to the quarters of<br>Draupadi where that princess resided with all the wives of the Pancala<br>king. Having despatched the son of Madri, Yudhishthira, crushed by grief,<br>proceeded with tears in his eyes accompanied by those friends of his, to<br>the field on which his sons had battled and which still teemed with<br>diverse kinds of creatures. Having entered that cursed field abounding<br>with fierce sights, the king saw his sons, well-wishers, and friends, all<br>lying on the ground, covered with blood, their bodies mangled, and heads<br>separated from their trunks. Beholding them in that plight, Yudhishthira,<br>that foremost of righteous men, became deeply afflicted. That chief of<br>the Kurus then began to weep aloud and fell down on the earth, deprived<br>of his senses, along with all his followers."
