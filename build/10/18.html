                            The holy one said, "After the krita-yuga had elapsed, the gods, desirous<br>of performing a sacrifice, duly made preparation for one according to the<br>directions laid down in the Vedas. They collected clarified butter and<br>the other requisites. And they not only devised what the requisites of<br>their sacrifice should be, but also determined those amongst themselves<br>that should have a share in the sacrificial offerings.<br><br>Not knowing Rudra truly, the celestials, O king, assigned no share for<br>the divine Sthanu. Seeing that the celestials assigned to him no share in<br>the sacrificial offerings, Sthanu, clad in deer skins, desired to destroy<br>that Sacrifice and with that object constructed a bow. There are four<br>kinds of Sacrifices: the loka Sacrifice, the Sacrifice of special rites,<br>the eternal domestic Sacrifice, and the Sacrifice consisting in the<br>gratification derived by man from his enjoyment of the five elemental<br>substances and their compounds. It is from these four kinds of Sacrifice<br>that the universe has sprung. Kapardin constructed that bow using as<br>materials the first and the fourth kinds of Sacrifices. The length of<br>that bow was five cubits. The sacred (mantra) "vashat," O Bharata, was<br>made its string. The four parts, of which a Sacrifice consists, became<br>the adornments of that bow.<br><br>Then Mahadeva, filled with rage, and taking up that bow, proceeded to<br>that spot where the celestials were engaged in their Sacrifice. Beholding<br>the unfading Rudra arrive there attired as a brahmacari and armed with<br>that bow, the goddess Earth shrunk with fear and the very mountains began<br>to tremble. The very wind ceased to move, and fire itself, though fed,<br>did not blaze forth. The stars in the firmament, in anxiety, began to<br>wander in irregular courses. The Sun's splendour decreased. The disc of<br>the Moon lost its beauty. The entire welkin became enveloped in a thick<br>gloom. The celestials, overwhelmed, knew not what to do. Their Sacrifice<br>ceased to blaze forth. The gods were all terrified. Rudra then pierced<br>the embodiment of Sacrifice with a fierce shaft in the heart. The<br>embodied form of Sacrifice, assuming the shape of a deer, fled away, with<br>the god of fire. Approaching heaven in that form, he blazed forth in<br>beauty. Rudra, however, O Yudhishthira, pursued him through the skies.<br>After Sacrifice had fled away, the gods lost their splendour. Having lost<br>their senses, the gods were stupefied.<br><br>Then the three-eyed Mahadeva, with his bow, broke in rage the arms of<br>Savitri, and plucked out the eyes of Bhaga and the teeth of Pushana. The<br>gods then fled away, as also all the several parts of Sacrifice. Some<br>amongst them, reeling as they sought to fly away, fell down senseless.<br>The blue-throated Rudra, having agitated them thus, laughed aloud, and<br>whirling the horn of his bow, paralysed them. The celestials then uttered<br>a cry. At their command, the string of the bow broke. The string having<br>broken, the bow became stretched into a line. The gods then approached<br>the bowless god of gods and, with the embodied form of Sacrifice, sought<br>the protection of the puissant Mahadeva and endeavoured to gratify him.<br><br>Gratified, the great god threw his wrath into the water, O king, that<br>wrath, assuming the form of fire, is always employed in consuming that<br>liquid element. He then gave unto Savitri his arms, Bhaga his eyes, and<br>Pushana his teeth. And he also restored the Sacrifices themselves, O<br>Pandava! The world once more became safe and sound. The gods assigned<br>unto Mahadeva all the libations of clarified butter as the share of great<br>deity. O monarch, when Mahadeva had become angry, the whole world had<br>thus become agitated: when he became gratified everything became safe.<br>Possessed of great energy, the god Mahadeva was gratified with<br>Ashvatthama. It was for this that thy sons, those mighty car-warriors,<br>could be slain by that warrior. It was for this that many other heroes,<br>the Pancalas, with all their followers, could be slain by him. Thou<br>shouldst not suffer thy mind to dwell on it. It was not Drona's son that<br>accomplished that act. It was done through the grace of Mahadeva. Do now<br>what should next be done."<br><br>The end of Sauptika-parv
