                            Om! Having bowed down unto Narayana, and Nara the most exalted of male<br>beings, and unto the goddess Sarasvati, must the word Jaya be uttered!<br><br>Sanjaya said, "Those heroes then together proceeded towards the south. At<br>the hour of sunset they reached a spot near the (Kuru) encampment.<br>Letting their animals loose they became very much frightened. Reaching<br>then a forest, they secretly entered it. They took up their quarters<br>there at no great distance from the encampment. Cut and mangled with many<br>keen weapons, they breathed long and hot sighs, thinking of the Pandavas.<br>Hearing the loud noise made by the victorious Pandavas, they feared a<br>pursuit and therefore fled towards the east. Having proceeded for<br>sometime, their animals became tired and they themselves became thirsty.<br>Overpowered by wrath and vindictiveness, those great bowmen could not put<br>up with what had occurred, burning as they did with (grief at) the<br>slaughter of the king. They however, took rest for a while."<br><br>Dhritarashtra said, "The feat, O Sanjaya, that Bhima achieved seems to be<br>incredible, since my son who was struck down possessed the strength of<br>10,000 elephants. In manhood's prime and possessed of an adamantine<br>frame, he was not capable of being slain by any creature! Alas, even that<br>son of mine was struck down by the Pandavas in battle! Without doubt, O<br>Sanjaya, my heart is made of adamant, since it breaks not into a 1,000<br>fragments even after hearing of the slaughter of my hundred sons! Alas,<br>what will be the plight of myself and my spouse, an old couple destitute<br>of children! I dare not dwell in the dominions of Pandu's son! Having<br>been the sire of a king and a king myself, O Sanjaya, how shall I pass my<br>days as a slave obedient to the commands of Pandu's son! Having laid my<br>commands over the whole Earth and having stayed over the heads of all, O<br>Sanjaya, how shall I live now as a slave in wretchedness? How shall I be<br>able, O Sanjaya, to endure the words of Bhima who hath single-handed<br>slain a full hundred sons of mine? The words of the high-souled Vidura<br>have come to be realised! Alas, my son, O Sanjaya, did not listen to<br>those words! What, however, did Kritavarma and Kripa and Drona's son do<br>after my son Duryodhana had been unfairly stuck down?"<br><br>Sanjaya said, "They had not proceeded far, O king, when they stopped, for<br>they beheld a dense forest abounding with trees and creepers. Having<br>rested for a little while, they entered that great forest, proceeding on<br>their cars drawn by their excellent steeds whose thirst had been<br>assuaged. That forest abounded with diverse kinds of animals, and it<br>teemed with various species of birds. And it was covered with many trees<br>and creepers and was infested by numerous carnivorous creatures. Covered<br>with many pieces of water and adorned with various kinds of flowers, it<br>had many lakes overgrown with blue lotuses.<br><br>Having entered that dense forest, they cast their eyes about and saw a<br>gigantic banyan tree with thousands of branches. Repairing to the shade<br>of that tree, those great car-warriors, O king, those foremost of men,<br>saw that was the biggest tree in that forest. Alighting from their cars,<br>and letting loose their animals, they cleansed themselves duly and said<br>their evening prayers. The Sun then reached the Asta mountains, and<br>Night, the mother of the universe, came. The firmament, bespangled with<br>planets and stars, shone like an ornamented piece of brocade and<br>presented a highly agreeable spectacle. Those creatures that walk the<br>night began to howl and utter their cries at will, while they that walk<br>the day owned the influence of sleep. Awful became the noise of the<br>night-wandering animals. The carnivorous creatures became full of glee,<br>and the night, as it deepened, became dreadful.<br><br>At that hour, filled with grief and sorrow, Kritavarma and Kripa and<br>Drona's son all sat down together. Seated under that banyan, they began<br>to give expression to their sorrow in respect of that very matter: the<br>destruction that had taken place of both the Kurus and the Pandavas.<br>Heavy with sleep, they laid themselves down on the bare earth. They had<br>been exceedingly tired and greatly mangled with shafts. The two great<br>car-warriors, Kripa and Kritavarma, succumbed to sleep. However deserving<br>of happiness and undeserving of misery, they then lay stretched on the<br>bare ground. Indeed, O monarch, those two who had always slept on costly<br>beds now slept, like helpless persons, on the bare ground, afflicted with<br>toil and grief.<br><br>Drona's son, however, O Bharata, yielding to the influence of wrath and<br>reverence, could not sleep, but continued to breathe like a snake.<br>Burning with rage, he could not get a wink of slumber. That hero of<br>mighty arms cast his eyes on every side of that terrible forest. As he<br>surveyed that forest peopled with diverse kinds of creatures, the great<br>warrior beheld a large banyan covered with crows. On that banyan<br>thousands of crows roosted in the night. Each perching separately from<br>its neighbour, those crows slept at ease, O Kauravya! As, however, those<br>birds were sleeping securely on every side, Ashvatthama beheld an owl of<br>terrible aspect suddenly make its appearance there. Of frightful cries<br>and gigantic body, with green eyes and tawny plumage, its nose was very<br>large and its talons were long. And the speed with which it came<br>resembled that of Garuda. Uttering soft cries that winged creature, O<br>Bharata, secretly approached the branches of that banyan. That ranger of<br>the sky, that slayer of crows, alighting on one of the branches of the<br>banyan, slew a large number of his sleeping enemies. He tore the wings of<br>some and cut off the heads of others with his sharp talons and broke the<br>legs of many. Endued with great strength, he slew many that fell down<br>before his eyes. With the limbs and bodies, O monarch, of the slain<br>crows, the ground covered by the spreading branches of the banyan became<br>thickly strewn on every side. Having slain those crows, the owl became<br>filled with delight like a slayer of foes after having behaved towards<br>his foes according to his pleasure.<br><br>Beholding that highly suggestive deed perpetrated in the night by the<br>owl, Drona's son began to reflect on it, desirous of framing his own<br>conduct by the light of that example. He said unto himself, "This owl<br>teaches me a lesson in battle. Bent as I am upon the destruction of the<br>foe, the time for the deed has come! The victorious Pandavas are<br>incapable of being slain by me! They are possessed of might, endued with<br>perseverance, sure of aim, and skilled in smiting. In the presence,<br>however, of the king I have vowed to slay them. I have thus pledged<br>myself to a self-destructive act, like an insect essaying to rush into a<br>blazing fire! If I were to fight fairly with them, I shall, without<br>doubt, have to lay down my life! By an act of guile, however, success may<br>yet be mine and a great destruction may overtake my foes! People<br>generally, as also those versed in the scriptures, always applaud those<br>means which are certain over those which are uncertain. Whatever of<br>censure and evil repute this act may provoke ought to be incurred by<br>person that is observant of kshatriya practices. The Pandavas of<br>uncleansed souls have, at every step, perpetrated very ugly and<br>censurable acts that are again fall of guile. As regards this matter,<br>certain ancient verses, full of truth, are heard, sung by truth-seeing<br>and righteousness-observing persons, who sang them after a careful<br>consideration of the demands of justice.<br><br>These verses are even these: The enemy's force, even when fatigued, or<br>wounded with weapons, or employed in eating, or when retiring, or when<br>resting within their camp, should be smitten. They should be dealt with<br>in the same way when afflicted with sleep in the dead of night, or when<br>reft of commanders, or when broken or when under the impression of an<br>error.'"<br><br>Having reflected in this way, the valiant son of Drona formed the<br>resolution of slaying during the night the slumbering Pandavas and the<br>Pancalas. Having formed this wicked resolution and pledged himself<br>repeatedly to its execution, he awoke both his maternal uncle and the<br>chief of Bhojas. Awakened from sleep, those two illustrious and mighty<br>persons, Kripa and the Bhoja chief, heard Ashvatthama's scheme. Filled<br>with shame, both of them abstained from giving a suitable reply.<br><br>Having reflected for a short while, Ashvatthama said with tearful eyes,<br>"King Duryodhana, that one hero of great might, for whose sake we were<br>waging hostilities with the Pandavas, hath been slain! Deserted and<br>alone, though he was the lord of eleven akshauhinis of troops, that hero<br>of unstained prowess hath been struck down by Bhimasena and a large<br>number of wretches banded together in battle! Another wicked act hath<br>been perpetrated by the vile Vrikodara, for the latter hath touched with<br>his foot the head of a person whose coronal locks underwent the sacred<br>bath! The Pancalas are uttering loud roars and cries and indulging in<br>loud bursts of laughter. Filled with joy, they are blowing their conchs<br>and beating their drums! The loud peal of their instruments, mingled with<br>the blare of conchs, is frightful to the ear and borne by the winds, is<br>filling all the points of the compass. Loud also is the din made by their<br>neighing steeds and grunting elephants and roaring warriors! That<br>deafening noise made by the rejoicing warriors as they are marching to<br>their quarters, as also the frightful clatter of their car-wheels, comes<br>to us from the east. So great hath been the havoc made by the Pandavas on<br>the Dhartarashtras that we three are the only survivors of that great<br>carnage! Some were endued with the might of a hundred elephants, and some<br>were masters of all weapons. Yet have they been slain by the sons of<br>Pandu! I regard this to be an instance of the reverses brought about by<br>Time! Truly, this is the end to which such an act leads! Truly, although<br>the Pandavas have achieved such difficult feats, even this should be the<br>result of those feats! If your wisdom hath not been driven away by<br>stupefaction, then say what is proper for us to do in view of this<br>calamitous and grave affair.'"
