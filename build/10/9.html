                            Sanjaya said, "Having slain all the Pancalas and the sons of Draupadi,<br>the three Kuru heroes together came to that spot where Duryodhana lay,<br>struck down by the foe. Arrived there, they beheld that life had not been<br>wholly extinct in the king. Jumping down from their cars, they surrounded<br>thy son. The Kuru king, O monarch, was lying there with broken thighs.<br>Almost senseless, his life was about to ebb away. He was vomiting blood<br>at intervals, with downcast eyes. He was then surrounded by a large<br>number of carnivorous animals of terrible forms, and by wolves and<br>hyenas, that awaited at no great distance for feeding upon his body. With<br>great difficulty the king was keeping off those beasts of prey that stood<br>in expectation of feasting upon him. He was writhing on the earth in<br>great agony. Beholding him thus lying on the earth, bathed in his own<br>blood, the three heroes who were the sole survivors of his army,<br>Ashvatthama and Kripa and Kritavarma, became afflicted with grief and sat<br>surrounding him. Encompassed by those three mighty car-warriors who were<br>covered with blood and who breathed hot sighs, the Kuru king looked like<br>a sacrificial altar surrounded by three fires. Beholding the king lying<br>in that highly undeserving plight, the three heroes wept in unendurable<br>sorrow. Wiping the blood from off his face with their hands, they uttered<br>these piteous lamentations in the hearing of the king lying on the field<br>of battle.<br><br>Kripa said, "There is nothing too difficult for destiny to bring about,<br>since even this king Duryodhana who was the lord of eleven akshauhinis of<br>troops sleepeth on the bare ground, struck down by the foes and covered<br>with blood! Behold, fond he was of the mace, and that mace decked with<br>pure gold still lieth by the side of the king whose splendour still<br>resembles that of pure gold! In no battle did that mace abandon this<br>hero! Even now, when he is about to ascend to heaven, that weapon leaveth<br>not this illustrious warrior. Behold, that weapon, adorned with pure<br>gold, still lieth by the side of this hero like a loving wife by the side<br>of her lord stretched on his bed in his chamber of sleep. Behold the<br>reverses brought about by Time! This scorcher of foes that used to walk<br>at the head of all crowned kings, now eateth the dust struck down (by the<br>foe)! He who had formerly struck down many foes and caused them to lie on<br>the bare ground, alas, that king of the Kurus lieth today on the bare<br>ground, struck down by foes. He to whom hundreds of kings used to bow<br>down in fear, lieth today on the field of battle, surrounded by beasts of<br>prey. The brahmanas formerly used to wait upon this lord for wealth.<br>Alas, beasts of prey wait upon him today for feeding upon his body!"<br><br>Sanjaya continued, "Beholding that chief of Kuru's race lying on the<br>ground, Ashvatthama, O best of the Bharatas, uttered these piteous<br>lamentations: "O tiger among kings, all people indicated thee as the<br>foremost of all bowmen! People also said that (in encounters with the<br>mace) thou, a disciple of Sankarshana, wert like the Lord of treasures<br>(Kuvera), himself! How then, O sinless one, could Bhima notice any lapses<br>in thee! Thou wert ever mighty and possessed of skill! He, on the other<br>hand, O king, is a wicked-souled wight! Without doubt, O monarch, Time in<br>this world is mightier than everything else, for we behold even thee<br>struck down by Bhimasena in battle! Alas, how could the wretched and mean<br>Vrikodara unrighteously strike thee down, thee that wert conversant with<br>every rule of righteousness! Without doubt, Time is irresistible. Alas,<br>having summoned thee to a fair fight, Bhimasena, putting forth his might,<br>fractured thy thighs. Fie on that wretched Yudhishthira who tolerated the<br>head of one unrighteously struck down in battle to be touched with the<br>foot! In all battles warriors will certainly reprove Vrikodara as long as<br>the world will last. Without doubt, thou hast been struck down<br>unrighteously!<br><br>The valiant Rama of Yadu's race, O king, always used to say that there is<br>no one equal to Duryodhana in encounters with the mace. He of the Vrishni<br>race, O Bharata, used to boast of thee, O lord, in every assembly,<br>saying, Duryodhana of Kurus race is a worthy disciple of mine!' Thou hast<br>obtained that end which great rishis have declared to be the high reward<br>of a kshatriya slain in battle with his face towards the foe. I do not, O<br>bull among men, grieve for thee, O Duryodhana! I grieve only for thy<br>mother Gandhari and thy sire, childless as they now are. Afflicted with<br>sorrow, they will have to wander over the earth, begging their food. Fie<br>on Krishna, Vrishni's race, and on Arjuna of wicked understanding! They<br>regard themselves conversant with the duties of morality, yet both of<br>them stood indifferent whilst thou wert being slain! How will the other<br>Pandavas, shameless though they are, O king, speak of the manner in which<br>they have accomplished thy death? Thou art highly fortunate, O son of<br>Gandhari, since thou hast been slain on the field of battle, O bull among<br>men, while advancing fairly against the foe. Alas, what will be the<br>plight of Gandhari who is now childless, and who hath lost all her<br>kinsmen and relatives! What also will be the plight of the blind king!<br><br>Fie on Kritavarma, on myself, as also on mighty car-warrior Kripa, since<br>we have not yet gone to heaven with thy royal self before us! Fie on us,<br>lowest of mortals, since we do not follow thee that wert the granter of<br>all wishes, the protector of all men, and the benefactor of all thy<br>subjects! Through thy power, the abodes of Kripa, of myself, and of my<br>sire, along with those of our dependants, O tiger among men, are full of<br>wealth. Through thy grace, ourselves with our friends and relatives have<br>performed many foremost of sacrifices with a profusion of presents to<br>brahmanas. Where shall such sinful persons as ourselves now go, since<br>thou hast gone to heaven, taking with thee all the kings of the earth?<br>Since we three, O king, do not follow thee that art about to obtain the<br>highest end (of life), it is for this that we are indulging in such<br>lamentations. Deprived of thy companionship, reft of wealth, our memories<br>painfully dwelling upon thy prosperity, alas, what will be our lot since<br>we do not go with thee? Without doubt, O chief of Kuru's race, we shall<br>have to wander in grief on the earth. Deprived of thee, O king, where can<br>we have peace and where can we have happiness?<br><br>Going from this world, O monarch, and meeting with those mighty<br>car-warriors (that have preceded thee), show thy regards to them, at my<br>request, one after another, according to the order of their rank and<br>years. Having offered worship to thy preceptor, that foremost of all<br>wielders of bows, tell him, O king, that Dhrishtadyumna hath been slain<br>by me. Embrace king Bahlika, that mighty car-warrior, as also the ruler<br>of the Sindhus, and Somadatta, Bhurishrava, and the other foremost of<br>kings that have preceded thee to heaven. At my request, embrace all of<br>them and enquire after their welfare."<br><br>Sanjaya continued, "Having said these words unto the king deprived of his<br>senses and lying with broken thighs, Ashvatthama once more cast his eyes<br>on him and uttered these words, "If, O Duryodhana, thou hast any life in<br>thee still, listen to these words that are so pleasant to hear. On the<br>side of the Pandavas, only seven are alive, and among the Dhartarashtras,<br>only we three! The seven on their side are the five brothers and Vasudeva<br>and Satyaki; on our side, we three are myself and Kripa and Kritavarma!<br>All the sons of Draupadi have been slain, as also all the children of<br>Dhrishtadyumna! All the Pancalas too have been slain, as also the remnant<br>of the Matsyas, O Bharata! Behold the vengeance taken for what they had<br>done! The Pandavas are now childless! While buried in sleep, the men and<br>animals in their camp have all been slain! Penetrating into their camp in<br>the night, O king, I have slain Dhrishtadyumna, that wight of sinful<br>deeds, as one kills an animal."<br><br>Duryodhana then, having heard those words that were so agreeable to his<br>heart, regained his senses and said these words in reply, "That which<br>neither Ganga's son, nor Karna, nor thy sire, could achieve, hath at last<br>been achieved by thee today, accompanied by Kripa and Bhoja. Thou hast<br>slain that low wretch (Dhrishtadyumna) who was commander of the Pandava<br>forces, as also Shikhandi. In consequence of this I regard myself equal<br>to Maghavat himself! Good be to you all! Let prosperity be yours! All of<br>us will again meet together in heaven!"<br><br>Having said these words the high-souled king of the Kurus became silent.<br>Casting off his griefs for all his (slain) kinsmen, he then gave up his<br>life-breath. His soul ascended to sacred heaven, while his body only<br>remained on earth. Even thus, O king, thy son Duryodhana breathed his<br>last. Having provoked the battle first, he was slain by his foes at last.<br>The three heroes repeatedly embraced the king and gazed steadfastly on<br>him. They then ascended their cars. Having heard these piteous<br>lamentations of Drona's son, I came away at early dawn towards the city.<br>Even thus the armies of the Kurus and Pandavas have been destroyed. Great<br>and terrible have been that carnage, O king, caused by thy evil policy.<br>After thy son had ascended to heaven, I became afflicted with grief and<br>the spiritual sight which the rishi gave hath been lost by me!"<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "The king, hearing of his son's death, breathed<br>long and hot sighs, and became plunged in great anxiety."
