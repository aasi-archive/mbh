                            Dhritarashtra said, "While Drona's son, that mighty car-warrior, thus<br>proceeded towards the hostile camp, did Kripa and Bhoja stop from fear? I<br>hope those two car-warriors checked by vulgar guards, did not fly away<br>secretly, thinking their opponents irresistible? Or, have they, after<br>grinding the camp, the Somakas, and the Pandavas, followed, while still<br>engaged in battle, the highly glorious path in which Duryodhana has gone?<br>Are those heroes, slain by the Pancalas, sleeping on the bare Earth? Did<br>they achieve any feat? Tell me all this, O Sanjaya!"<br><br>Sanjaya said, "When the high-souled son of Drona proceeded towards the<br>camp, Kripa and Kritavarma waited at the gate. Beholding them ready to<br>exert themselves, Ashvatthama became filled with joy, and addressing them<br>whisperingly, O king, said, "If you two exert, you are competent to<br>exterminate all the kshatriyas! What need I say, therefore, of this<br>remnant of the (Pandava) army, particularly when it is buried in sleep? I<br>shall enter the camp and career like Yama. I am sure that you two will<br>act in such way that no man may escape you with life."<br><br>Having said these words, the son of Drona entered the vast camp of the<br>Parthas; casting off all fear, he penetrated into it by a spot where<br>there was no door. The mighty-armed hero, having entered the camp,<br>proceeded, guided by signs, very softly, towards the quarters of<br>Dhrishtadyumna. The Pancalas, having achieved great feats, had been much<br>tired in battle. They were sleeping in confidence, assembled together,<br>and by the side of one another. Entering into Dhrishtadyumna's chamber, O<br>Bharata, Drona's son beheld the prince of the Pancalas sleeping before<br>him on his bed. He lay on a beautiful sheet of silk upon a costly and<br>excellent bed. Excellent wreaths of flowers were strewn upon that bed and<br>it was perfumed with powdered dhupa. Ashvatthama, O king, awoke with a<br>kick the high-souled prince sleeping trustfully and fearlessly on his<br>bed. Feeling that kick, the prince, irresistible in battle and of<br>immeasurable soul, awaked from sleep and recognised Drona's son standing<br>before him. As he was rising from his bed, the mighty Ashvatthama seized<br>him by the hair of his head and began to press him down on the earth with<br>his hands. Thus pressed by Ashvatthama with great strength, the prince,<br>from fear as also from sleepiness, was not able to put forth his strength<br>at that time. Striking him with his foot, O king, on both his throat and<br>breast while his victim writhed and roared, Drona's son endeavoured to<br>kill him as if he were an animal. The Pancala prince tore Ashvatthama<br>with his nails and at last softly said, "O preceptor's son, slay me with<br>a weapon, do not tarry! O best of men, let me, through thy act, repair to<br>the regions of the righteous!"<br><br>Having said this much, that slayer of foes, the son of the Pancala king,<br>assailed with strength by that mighty hero, became silent. Hearing those<br>indistinct sounds of his, Drona's son said, "O wretch of thy race, there<br>is no region for those that slay their preceptors. For this, O thou of<br>wicked understanding, thou deservest not to be slain with any weapon!"<br>While saying so, Ashvatthama, filled with rage, began to strike the vital<br>parts of his victim with violent kicks of his heels, and slew his foe<br>like a lion slaying an infuriated elephant. At the cries of that hero<br>while he was being slain, his wives and guards that were in his tent all<br>awake, O king! Beholding somebody crushing the prince with superhuman<br>force, they regarded the assailant to be some preternatural being and,<br>therefore, uttered no cries from fear. Having despatched him to Yama's<br>abode by such means, Ashvatthama of great energy went out and getting<br>upon his beautiful car stayed on it. Indeed, coming out of<br>Dhrishtadyumna's abode, O king, Ashvatthama caused all the points of the<br>compass to resound with his roars, and then proceeded on his car to other<br>parts of the camp for slaying his foes.<br><br>After Drona's son, that mighty car-warrior, had gone away, the women and<br>all the guards set up a loud wail of woe. Seeing their king slain, all<br>the wives of Dhrishtadyumna, filled with great sorrow, cried. At that<br>wail of theirs many mighty kshatriyas, awaking, put on their armour and<br>came there for enquiring after the cause of those cries. Those ladies,<br>terrified at the sight of Ashvatthama, in piteous tones asked the men to<br>pursue him without delay. They said, "Whether he is a rakshasa or a human<br>being, we know not what he is! Having slain the Pancala king, he stayeth<br>there!" At these words, those foremost of warriors suddenly surrounded<br>Drona's son. The latter slew them all by means of the rudrastra. Having<br>slain Dhrishtadyumna and all those followers of his, he beheld Uttamauja<br>sleeping on his bed. Attacking him with his foot on the throat and chest,<br>Drona's son slew that great hero also while the latter writhed in agony.<br>Yudhamanyu, coming up and believing his comrade to have been slain by a<br>rakshasa, speedily struck Drona's son in the chest with a mace. Rushing<br>towards him, Ashvatthama seized him and brought him down to the ground<br>and slew him like an animal while the latter uttered loud shrieks.<br><br>Having slain Yudhamanyu thus, that hero proceeded against the other<br>car-warriors of the king, who were all asleep. He slew all those<br>trembling and shrieking warriors like animals in a sacrifice. Taking up<br>his sword then, he slew many others. Proceeding along the diverse paths<br>of the camp, one after another, Ashvatthama, accomplished in the use of<br>the sword, beheld diverse gulmas and slew in a trice the unarmed and<br>tired warriors sleeping within them. With that excellent sword he cut off<br>combatants and steeds and elephants. Covered all over with blood, he<br>seemed then to be Death himself commissioned by time. Causing his foes to<br>tremble by the repeated blows of his sword that were of three kinds,<br>Ashvatthama became bathed in blood. Covered as he was with blood, and<br>wielding as he did a blazing sword, his form, as he careered in battle,<br>became exceedingly terrible and superhuman. Those who awaked from sleep,<br>O Kaurava, became stupefied with the loud noise (they heard around).<br>Beholding Drona's son, they looked at each other's faces and trembled<br>(with fear). Those kshatriyas, beholding the form of that crusher of<br>foes, believed him to be a rakshasa and closed their eyes.<br><br>Of terrible form, he careered in the camp like Yama himself, and at last<br>saw the sons of Draupadi and the remnant of the Somakas. Alarmed by the<br>noise, and learning that Dhrishtadyumna had been slain, those mighty<br>car-warriors, the sons of Draupadi, armed with bows, fearlessly poured<br>their shafts on Drona's son. Awakened by their noise, the Prabhadrakas<br>with Shikhandi at their head, began to grind the son of Drona with their<br>arrows. Drona's son, beholding them shower their arrows on him, uttered a<br>loud roar and became desirous of slaying those mighty car-warriors.<br>Recollecting the death of his sire, Ashvatthama became filled with rage.<br>Alighting from the terrace of his car, he rushed furiously (against his<br>enemies). Taking up his bright shield with a 1,000 moons and his massive<br>and celestial sword decked with gold, the mighty Ashvatthama rushed<br>against the sons of Draupadi and began to lay about him with his weapon.<br>Then that tiger among men, in that dreadful battle, struck Prativindhya<br>in the abdomen, at which the latter, O king, deprived of life, fell down<br>on the Earth. The valiant Sutasoma, having pierced the son of Drona with<br>a lance, rushed at him with his uplifted sword. Ashvatthama, however cut<br>off Sutasoma's arm with the sword in grasp, and once more struck him in<br>the flank. At this, Sutasoma fell down, bereft of life. The valiant<br>Shatanika, the son of Nakula, taking up a car-wheel with his two hands,<br>violently struck Ashvatthama at the chest. The regenerate Ashvatthama<br>violently assailed Shatanika after he had hurled that car-wheel.<br>Exceedingly agitated, Nakula's son fell down upon the Earth, upon which<br>Drona's son cut off his head. Then Shrutakarma, taking up a spiked<br>bludgeon, attacked Ashvatthama. Furiously rushing at Drona's son, he<br>assailed him violently on the left part of his forehead. Ashvatthama<br>struck Shrutakarma with his excellent sword on the face. Deprived of<br>senses and his face disfigured, he fell down lifeless on the Earth. At<br>this noise, the heroic Shrutakirti, that great car-warrior, coming up,<br>poured showers of arrows on Ashvatthama. Baffling those arrowy showers<br>with his shield, Ashvatthama cut off from the enemy's trunk the latter's<br>beautiful head adorned with ear-rings. Then the slayer of Bhishma, the<br>mighty Shikhandi, with all the Prabhadrakas, assailed the hero from every<br>side with diverse kinds of weapons. Shikhandi struck Ashvatthama with an<br>arrow in the midst of his two eyebrows. Filled with rage at this, Drona's<br>son, possessed of great might, approached Shikhandi and cut him into<br>twain with his sword. Having slain Shikhandi, Ashvatthama, filled with<br>rage, rushed furiously against the other Prabhadrakas. He proceeded also<br>against the remnant of Virata's force.<br><br>Endued with great strength, Drona's son made a heavy carnage amongst the<br>sons, the grandsons, and the followers of Drupada, singling them out one<br>after another. Accomplished in the use of the sword, Ashvatthama then,<br>rushing against other combatants, cut them down with his excellent sword.<br>The warriors in the Pandava camp beheld that Death-Night in her embodied<br>form, a black image, of bloody mouth and bloody eyes, wearing crimson<br>garlands and smeared with crimson unguents, attired in a single piece of<br>red cloth, with a noose in hand, and resembling an elderly lady, employed<br>in chanting a dismal note and standing full before their eyes, and about<br>to lead away men and steeds and elephants all tied in a stout cord. She<br>seemed to take away diverse kinds of spirits, with dishevelled hair and<br>tied together in a cord, as also, O king, many mighty car-warriors<br>divested of their weapons. On other days, O sire, the foremost warriors<br>of the Pandava camp used to see in their dreams that figure leading away<br>the sleeping combatants and Drona's son smiting them behind! The Pandava<br>soldiers saw that lady and Drona's son in their dreams every night from<br>the day when the battle between the Kurus and the Pandavas first<br>commenced. Afflicted before by Destiny, they were now smitten by Drona's<br>son who terrified them all with the frightful roars uttered by him.<br>Afflicted by Destiny, the brave warriors of the Pandava camp,<br>recollecting the sight they had seen in their dreams, identified it with<br>what they now witnessed.<br><br>At the noise made, hundreds and thousands of Pandava bowmen in the camp<br>awoke from their slumbers. Ashvatthama cut off the legs of some, and the<br>hips of others, and pierced some in their flanks, careering like the<br>Destroyer himself let loose by Time. The Earth, O lord, was soon covered<br>with human beings that were crushed into shapelessness or trodden down by<br>elephants and steeds and with others that roared in great affliction.<br>Many of them loudly exclaimed, "What is this?" "Who is this one?" "What<br>is this noise?" "Who is doing what?" While uttering such shrieks, Drona's<br>son became their Destroyer. That foremost of smiters, the son of Drona,<br>despatched to regions of Yama all those Pandus and Srinjayas who were<br>without armour and weapons. Terrified at that noise, many awoke from<br>sleep. Possessed with fear, blinded by sleep, and deprived of their<br>senses, those warriors seemed to vanish (before the fury of Ashvatthama).<br>The thighs of many were paralysed and many were so stupefied that they<br>lost all their energy. Shrieking and possessed with fear, they began to<br>slay one another. Drona's son once more got upon his car of terrible<br>clatter and taking up his bow despatched many with his shafts to Yama's<br>abode. Others awoke from sleep, brave warriors and foremost of men, as<br>they came towards Ashvatthama, were slain before they could approach him<br>and were thus offered up as victims unto that Death-Night. Crushing many<br>with that foremost of cars, he careered through the camp, and covered his<br>foes with repeated showers of arrows. Once again with that beautiful<br>shield of his, adorned with hundred moons, and with that sword of his<br>which was of the hue of the welkin, he careered amidst his enemies. Like<br>an elephant agitating a large lake, Drona's son, irresistible, in battle,<br>agitated the camp of the Pandavas.<br><br>Awaked by the noise, O king, many warriors, afflicted still with sleep<br>and fear, and with senses still under a cloud, ran hither and thither.<br>Many shrieked in harsh tones and many uttered incoherent exclamations.<br>Many succeeded not in obtaining their weapons and armour. The locks of<br>many were dishevelled, and many failed to recognise one another. Having<br>risen from sleep, many fell down, fatigued; some wandered here and there<br>without any purpose. Elephants and steeds, breaking their cords, passed<br>excreta and urine. Many, causing great confusion, huddled together.<br>Amongst these, some through fear laid themselves down on the earth. The<br>animals of the camp crushed them there.<br><br>While the camp was in this state, rakshasas, O king, uttered loud roars<br>in joy, O chief of the Bharatas! The loud noise, O king, uttered by<br>ghostly beings in joy, filled all the points of the compass and the<br>welkin. Hearing the wails of woe, elephants, steeds, breaking their<br>cords, rushed hither and thither, crushing the combatants in the camp. As<br>those animals rushed hither and thither, the dust raised by them made the<br>night doubly dark. When that thick gloom set in, the warriors in the camp<br>became perfectly stupefied; sires recognised not their sons, brothers<br>recognised not their brothers. Elephants assailing riderless elephants,<br>and steeds assailing riderless steeds, assailed and broke and crushed the<br>people that stood in their way. Losing all order, combatants rushed and<br>slew one another, and felling those that stood in their way, crushed them<br>into pieces. Deprived of their senses and overcome with sleep, and<br>enveloped in gloom, men, impelled by fate, slew their own comrades. The<br>guards, leaving the gates they watched, and those at duty at the outposts<br>leaving the posts they guarded, fled away for their lives, deprived of<br>their senses and not knowing whither they proceeded. They slew one<br>another, the slayers, O lord, not recognising the slain. Afflicted by<br>Fate, they cried after their sires and sons. While they fled, abandoning<br>their friends and relatives, they called upon one another, mentioning<br>their families and names. Other, uttering cries of "Oh!" and "Alas!" fell<br>down on the earth. In the midst of the battle, Drona's son, recognising<br>them, slew them all.<br><br>Other kshatriyas, while being slaughtered, lost their senses, and<br>afflicted by fear, sought to fly away from their camps. Those men that<br>sought to fly away from their camp for saving their lives, were slain by<br>Kritavarma and Kripa at the gate. Divested of weapons and instruments and<br>armour, and with dishevelled hair, they joined their hands. Trembling<br>with fear, they were on the ground. The two Kuru warriors, however, (who<br>were on their cars) gave quarter to none. None amongst those that escaped<br>from the camp was let off by those two wicked persons, Kripa and<br>Kritavarma. Then again, for doing that which was highly agreeable to<br>Drona's son, those two set fire to the Pandava camp in three places.<br><br>When the camp was lighted, Ashvatthama, that delighter of his sires, O<br>monarch, careered, sword in hand and smiting his foes with great skill.<br>Some of his brave foes rushed towards him and some ran hither and<br>thither. That foremost of regenerate ones, with his sword, deprived all<br>of them of their lives. The valiant son of Drona, filled with rage,<br>felled some of the warriors, cutting them in twain with his sword as if<br>they were sesame stalks. The Earth, O bull of Bharata's race, became<br>strewn with the fallen bodies of the foremost of men and steeds and<br>elephants mingled together and uttering woeful wails and cries. When<br>thousands of men had fallen down deprived of life, innumerable headless<br>trunks stood up and fell down. Ashvatthama, O Bharata, cut off arms<br>adorned with angadas and holding weapons in grasp, and heads, and thighs<br>resembling trunks of elephants, and hands, and feet. The illustrious son<br>of Drona mangled the backs of some, cut off the heads of some, and caused<br>some to turn away from the fight. And he cut off some at the middle, and<br>lopped off the ears of others, and struck others on the shoulders, and<br>pressed down the heads of some into their trunks.<br><br>As Ashvatthama careered in this way, slaughtering thousands of men, the<br>deep night became more terrible in consequence of the darkness that set<br>in. The earth became terrible to behold, strewn with thousands of human<br>beings dead and dying and innumerable steeds and elephants. Cut off by<br>the enraged son of Drona, his foes fell down on the earth that was then<br>crowded with yakshas and rakshasas, and frightful with (broken) cars and<br>slain steeds and elephants. Some called upon their brothers, some upon<br>their sires, and some upon their sons. And some said, "The Dhartarashtras<br>in rage could never accomplish such feats in battle as these which<br>rakshasas of wicked deeds are achieving (upon us) during the hour of<br>sleep! It is only in consequence of the absence of the Parthas that this<br>great slaughter is going on. That son of Kunti, who hath Janardana for<br>his protector, is incapable of being vanquished by gods, asuras,<br>gandharvas, yakshas and rakshasas! Devoted to Brahma, truthful in speech,<br>self-restrained, and compassionate towards all creatures, that son of<br>Pritha, called Dhananjaya, never slaughters one that is asleep, or one<br>that is heedless, or one that has laid aside his weapons or one that has<br>joined his hands in supplication, or one that is retreating, or one whose<br>locks have been dishevelled. Alas, they are rakshasas of wicked deeds who<br>are perpetrating such terrible act upon us." Uttering such words, many<br>laid themselves down.<br><br>The loud din caused by the cries and groans of human beings died away<br>within a short space of time. The earth being drenched with blood, O<br>king, that thick and frightful dust soon disappeared. Thousands of men<br>moving in agony, overwhelmed with anxiety and overcome with despair, were<br>slain by Ashvatthama like Rudra slaying living creatures. Many who laid<br>themselves down on the ground clasping one another, and many who sought<br>to fly away, and many who sought to hide themselves, and many who<br>struggled in battle, were all slain by the son of Drona. Burnt by the<br>raging flames and slaughtered by Ashvatthama, the men, losing their<br>senses, slew one another. Before half the night was over, the son of<br>Drona, O monarch, despatched the large host of the Pandavas unto Yama's<br>abode.<br><br>That night, so terrible and destructive unto human beings and elephants<br>and steeds filled with joy all creatures that wander in the dark. Many<br>rakshasas and pishacas of various tribes were seen there, gorging upon<br>human flesh and quaffing the blood that lay on the ground. They were<br>fierce, tawny in hue, terrible, of adamantine teeth, and dyed with blood.<br>With matted locks on their heads, their thighs were long and massive;<br>endued with five feet, their stomachs were large. Their fingers were set<br>backwards. Of harsh temper and ugly features, their voice was loud and<br>terrible. They had rows of tinkling bells tied to their bodies. Possessed<br>of blue throats, they looked very frightful. Exceedingly cruel and<br>incapable of being looked at without fear, and without abhorrence for<br>anything, they came there with their children and wives. Indeed, diverse<br>were the forms seen there of the rakshasas that came. Quaffing the blood<br>that ran in streams, they became filled with joy and began to dance in<br>separate bands. "This is excellent!" "This is pure!" "This is very<br>sweet!" these were the words they uttered.<br><br>Other carnivorous creatures, subsisting upon animal food, having gorged<br>upon fat and marrow and bones and blood, began to eat the delicate parts<br>of corpses. Others, drinking the fat that flowed in streams, ran naked<br>over the field. Possessed of diverse kinds of faces, other carnivorous<br>beings of great ferocity, and living upon dead flesh, came there in tens<br>of thousands and millions. Grim and gigantic rakshasas also, of wicked<br>deeds, came there in bands as numerous. Other ghostly beings, filled with<br>joy and gorged to satiety, O king, also came there and were seen in the<br>midst of that dreadful carnage.<br><br>When morning dawned, Ashvatthama desired to leave the camp. He was then<br>bathed in human blood and the hilt of his sword so firmly adhered in his<br>grasp that his hand and sword, O king, became one! Having walked in that<br>path that is never trod (by good warriors), Ashvatthama, after that<br>slaughter, looked like the blazing fire at the end of the yuga after it<br>has consumed all creatures into ashes. Having perpetrated that feat<br>agreeably to his vow, and having trod in that untrodden way, Drona's son,<br>O lord, forgot his grief for the slaughter of his sire. The Pandava camp,<br>in consequence of the sleep in which all within it were buried, was<br>perfectly still when Drona's son had entered it in the night.<br><br>After the nocturnal slaughter, when all became once more quiet,<br>Ashvatthama issued from it. Having issued from the camp, the valiant<br>Ashvatthama met his two companions and, filled with joy, told them of his<br>feat, gladdening them, O king, by the intelligence. Those two, in return,<br>devoted as they were to his good, gave him the agreeable intelligence of<br>how they also had slaughtered thousands of Pancalas and Srinjayas (at the<br>gates). Even thus did that night prove terribly destructive to the<br>Somakas who had been heedless and buried in sleep. The course of time,<br>without doubt, is irresistible. Those who had exterminated us were<br>themselves exterminated now."<br><br>Dhritarashtra said, "Why is it that that mighty car-warrior, the son of<br>Drona, did not achieve such a feat before although he had resolutely<br>exerted himself for bestowing victory upon Duryodhana? For what reason<br>did that great bowman do this after the slaughter of the wretched<br>Duryodhana? It behoveth thee to tell me this!"<br><br>Sanjaya said, "Through fear of the Parthas, O son of Kuru's race,<br>Ashvatthama could not achieve such a feat then. It was owing to the<br>absence of the Parthas and the intelligent Keshava as also of Satyaki,<br>that Drona's son could accomplish it. Who is there, the lord Indra<br>unexcepted, that is competent to slay them in the presence of these<br>heroes? Besides, O king, Ashvatthama succeeded in accomplishing the feat<br>only because the men were all asleep. Having caused that vast slaughter<br>of the Pandava forces, those three great car-warriors (Ashvatthama, Kripa<br>and Kritavarma), meeting together, exclaimed, "Good luck!" His two<br>companions congratulated Ashvatthama, and the latter was also embraced by<br>them. In great joy the latter uttered these words: "All the Pancalas have<br>been slain, as also all the sons of Draupadi! All the Somakas also, as<br>well as all that remained of the Matsyas, have been slaughtered by me!<br>Crowned with success, let us without delay go there where the king is!
