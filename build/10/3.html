                            Sanjaya said, "Hearing these words of Kripa that were auspicious and<br>fraught with morality and profit, Ashvatthama, O monarch, became<br>overwhelmed with sorrow and grief. Burning with grief as if with a<br>blazing fire, he formed a wicked resolution and then addressed them both<br>saying, "The faculty of understanding is different in different men. Each<br>man, however, is pleased with own understanding. Every man regards<br>himself more intelligent than others. Everyone respects his own<br>understanding and accords it great praise. Everyone's own wisdom is with<br>every one a subject of praise. Everyone speaks ill of the wisdom of<br>others, and well of his own, in all instances. Men whose judgements agree<br>with respect to any unattained object, even though there be a variety of<br>considerations, become gratified with and applaud one another. The<br>judgements, again, of the same men, overwhelmed with reverses through the<br>influence of time, become opposed to one another. More particularly, in<br>consequence of the diversity of human intellects, judgements necessarily<br>differ when intellects are clouded.<br><br>As a skilful physician, having duly diagnosed a disease, prescribes a<br>medicine by the application of his intelligence for effecting a cure,<br>even so men, for the accomplishment of their acts, use their<br>intelligence, aided by their own wisdom. What they do is again<br>disapproved by others. A man, in youth, is affected by one kind of<br>understanding. In middle age, the same does not prevail with him, and in<br>the period of decay, a different kind of understanding becomes agreeable<br>to him. When fallen into terrible distress or when visited by great<br>prosperity, the understanding of a person, O chief of the Bhojas, is seen<br>to be much afflicted. In one and the same person, through want of wisdom,<br>the understanding becomes different at different times. That<br>understanding which at one time is acceptable becomes the reverse of that<br>at another time.<br><br>Having resolved, however, according to one's wisdom, that resolution<br>which is excellent should be endeavoured to be accomplished. Such<br>resolution, therefore, should force him to put forth exertion. All<br>persons, O chief of the Bhojas, joyfully begin to act, even in respect of<br>enterprises that lead to death, in the belief that those enterprises are<br>achievable by them. All men, relying on their own judgements and wisdom,<br>endeavour to accomplish diverse purposes, knowing them to be beneficial.<br>The resolution that has possessed my mind today in consequence of our<br>great calamity, as something that is capable of dispelling my grief, I<br>will now disclose unto both of you.<br><br>The Creator, having formed his creatures, assigned unto each his<br>occupation. As regards the different orders, he gave unto each a portion<br>of excellence. Unto brahmanas he assigned that foremost of all things,<br>the Veda. Unto the kshatriya he assigned superior energy. Unto the<br>vaishya he gave skill, and unto the shudra he gave the duty of serving<br>the three other classes. Hence, a brahmana without self-restraint is<br>censurable. A kshatriya without energy is base. A vaishya without skill<br>is worthy of dispraise, as also a shudra who is bereft of humility (to<br>the other orders).<br><br>I am born in an adorable and high family of brahmanas. Through ill-luck,<br>however, I am wedded to kshatriya practices. If, conversant as I am with<br>kshatriya duties, I adopt now the duties of a brahmana and achieve a high<br>object (the purification of self under such injuries), that course would<br>not be consistent with nobleness. I hold an excellent bow and excellent<br>weapons in battle. If I do not avenge the slaughter of my sire, how shall<br>I open my mouth in the midst of men? Paying regard to kshatriya duties,<br>therefore, without hesitation, I shall today walk in the steps of my<br>high-souled sire and the king.<br><br>The Pancalas, elated with victory, will trustfully sleep tonight, having<br>put off their armour and in great glee, and filled with happiness at the<br>thought of the victory they have won, and spent with toil and exertion.<br>While sleeping at their ease during the night within their own camp, I<br>shall make a great and terrible assault upon their camp. Like Maghavat<br>slaying the danavas, I shall, attacking them while senseless and dead in<br>sleep in their camp, slay them all, putting forth my prowess. Like a<br>blazing fire consuming a heap of dry grass, I shall slay all of them<br>assembled in one place with their leader Dhrishtadyumna! Having slain the<br>Pancalas, I shall obtain peace of mind, O best of men! While engaged in<br>the act of slaughter, I shall career in their midst like the wielder of<br>Pinaka, Rudra himself, in rage among living creatures. Having cut off and<br>slain all the Pancalas today, I shall then, in joy, afflict the sons of<br>Pandu in battle. Taking their lives one after another and causing the<br>earth to be strewn with the bodies of all the Pancalas, I shall pay off<br>the debt I owe to my sire. I shall today make the Pancalas follow in the<br>wake, hard to tread, of Duryodhana and Karna and Bhishma, and the ruler<br>of the Sindhus. Putting forth my might, I shall tonight grind the head,<br>like that of any animal, of Dhrishtadyumna, the king of the Pancalas! I<br>shall tonight, O son of Gautama, cut off with my sharp sword, in battle,<br>the sleeping sons of the Pancalas and the Pandavas. Having exterminated<br>the Pancalas army tonight while sunk in sleep, I shall, O thou of great<br>intelligence, obtain great happiness and regard myself to have done my<br>duty!"
