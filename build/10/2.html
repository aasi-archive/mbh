                            Kripa said, "We have heard all that thou hast said, O puissant one!<br>Listen, however, to a few words of mine, O mighty armed one! All men are<br>subjected to and governed by these two forces, Destiny and Exertion.<br>There is nothing higher than these two. Our acts do not become successful<br>in consequence of destiny alone, nor of exertion alone, O best of men!<br>Success springs from the union of the two. All purposes, high and low,<br>are dependent on a union of those two. In the whole world, it is through<br>these two that men are seen to act as also to abstain. What result is<br>produced by the clouds pouring upon a mountain? What results are not<br>produced by them pouring upon a cultivated field? Exertion, where destiny<br>is not auspicious, and absence of exertion where destiny is auspicious,<br>both these are fruitless! What I have said before (about the union of the<br>two) is the truth. If the rains properly moisten a well-tilled soil, the<br>seed produces great results. Human success is of this nature.<br><br>Sometimes, Destiny, having settled a course of events, acts of itself<br>(without waiting for exertion). For all that, the wise, aided by skill<br>have recourse to exertion. All the purposes of human acts, O bull among<br>men, are accomplished by the aid of those two together. Influenced by<br>these two, men are seen to strive or abstain. Recourse may be had to<br>exertion. But exertion succeeds through destiny. It is in consequence<br>also of destiny that one who sets himself to work, depending on exertion,<br>attains to success. The exertion, however, of even a competent man, even<br>when well directed, is without the concurrence of destiny, seen in the<br>world to be unproductive of fruit. Those, therefore, among men, that are<br>idle and without intelligence, disapprove of exertion. This however, is<br>not the opinion of the wise.<br><br>Generally, an act performed is not seen to be unproductive of fruit in<br>the world. The absent of action, again, is seen to be productive of grave<br>misery. A person obtaining something of itself without having made any<br>efforts, as also one not obtaining anything even after exertion, is not<br>to be seen. One who is busy in action is capable of supporting life. He,<br>on the other hand, that is idle, never obtains happiness. In this world<br>of men it is generally seen that they that are addicted to action are<br>always inspired by the desire of earning good. If one devoted to action<br>succeeds in gaining his object or fails to obtain the fruit of his acts,<br>he does not become censurable in any respect. If anyone in the world is<br>seen to luxuriously enjoy the fruits of action without doing any action,<br>he is generally seen to incur ridicule and become an object of hatred. He<br>who, disregarding this rule about action, liveth otherwise, is said to do<br>an injury to himself. This is the opinion of those that are endued with<br>intelligence.<br><br>Efforts become unproductive of fruits in consequence of these two<br>reasons: destiny without exertion and exertion without destiny. Without<br>exertion, no act in this world becomes successful. Devoted to action and<br>endued with skill, that person, however, who, having bowed down to the<br>gods, seeks, the accomplishment of his objects, is never lost. The same<br>is the case with one who, desirous of success, properly waits upon the<br>aged, asks of them what is for his good, and obeys their beneficial<br>counsels. Men approved by the old should always be solicited for counsel<br>while one has recourse to exertion. These men are the infallible root of<br>means, and success is dependent on means. He who applies his efforts<br>after listening to the words of the old, soon reaps abundant fruits from<br>those efforts. That man who, without reverence and respect for others<br>(capable of giving him good counsel), seeks the accomplishment of his<br>purposes, moved by passion, anger, fear, and avarice, soon loses his<br>prosperity.<br><br>This Duryodhana, stained by covetousness and bereft of foresight, had<br>without taking counsel, foolishly commenced to seek the accomplishment of<br>an undigested project. Disregarding all his well-wishers and taking<br>counsel with only the wicked, he had, though dissuaded, waged hostilities<br>with the Pandavas who are his superiors in all good qualities. He had,<br>from the beginning, been very wicked. He could not restrain himself. He<br>did not do the bidding of friends. For all that, he is now burning in<br>grief and amid calamity. As regards ourselves since we have followed that<br>sinful wretch, this great calamity hath, therefore, overtaken us! This<br>great calamity has scorched my understanding. Plunged in reflection, I<br>fail to see what is for our good!<br><br>A man that is stupefied himself should ask counsel of his friends. In<br>such friends he hath his understanding, his humility, and his prosperity.<br>One's actions should have their root in them. That should be done which<br>intelligent friends, having settled by their understanding, should<br>counsel. Let us, therefore, repair to Dhritarashtra and Gandhari and the<br>high-souled Vidura and ask them as what we should do. Asked by us, they<br>will say what, after all this, is for our good. We should do what they<br>say. Even this is my certain resolution. Those men whose acts do not<br>succeed even after the application of exertion, should, without doubt, be<br>regarded as afflicted by destiny."
