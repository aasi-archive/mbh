                            Vaishampayana said, "At the very sight, O tiger among men, of those two<br>rishis possessed of splendour like that of fire, Dhananjaya quickly<br>resolved to withdraw his celestial shaft. Joining his hands, he addressed<br>those rishis, saying, I used this weapon, saying, "Let it neutralise the<br>(enemy's) weapon!" If I withdraw this high weapon, Drona's son of sinful<br>deeds will then, without doubt, consume us all with the energy of his<br>weapon. Ye two are like gods! It behoveth you to devise some means by<br>which our welfare as also that of the three worlds may be secured!'<br><br>Having said these words Dhananjaya withdrew his weapon. The withdrawal of<br>that weapon by the gods themselves in battle is exceedingly difficult.<br>Not excepting the great Indra himself, there was nobody save the son of<br>Pandu, who was capable of withdrawing that high weapon after it had once<br>been let off. That weapon was born of Brahma energy. No person of<br>uncleansed soul can bring it back after it is once let off. Only one that<br>leads the life of a brahmacari can do it. If one who has not practised<br>the vow of brahmacarya seeks to bring it back after having shot it, it<br>strikes off his own head and destroys him with all his equipments. Arjuna<br>was a brahmacari and an observer of vows. Having obtained that almost<br>unobtainable weapon, he had never used it even when plunged into<br>situations of the greatest danger. Observant of the vow of truth,<br>possessed of great heroism, leading the life of a brahmacari, the son of<br>Pandu was submissive and obedient to all his superiors. It was for this<br>that he succeeded in withdrawing his weapon.<br><br>Drona's son, beholding those two rishis standing before him, could not by<br>his energy withdraw his own terrible weapon. Unable to withdraw the high<br>weapon in battle, Drona's son, O king, with a cheerless heart, said unto<br>the island-born rishi these words, Threatened by a great danger, and<br>desirous of protecting my life, I let off this weapon, through fear of<br>Bhimasena, O sage! This Bhimasena of false behaviour, acted sinfully, O<br>holy one, while slaying the son of Dhritarashtra in battle! It is for<br>this, O regenerate one, that of uncleansed soul as I am I let off this<br>weapon. I dare not, however, withdraw it now. Having inspired this<br>irresistible and celestial weapon with the energy of fire, I let it off<br>for the destruction of the Pandavas. Contrived for the destruction of the<br>Pandavas, that weapon, therefore, will take away the lives of all the<br>sons of Pandu. O regenerate one, I have, in wrath, done this sinful deed.<br>I invoked this weapon in battle for the destruction of the Pandavas.'<br><br>Vyasa said, "Pritha's son Dhananjaya, O child, was acquainted with the<br>weapon called brahmashira. Neither from wrath, nor for thy destruction in<br>battle, did he shoot this weapon. Arjuna, on the other hand, used it for<br>baffling thy weapon. He has again withdrawn it. Having obtained even the<br>brahmastra through thy sire's instructions, the mighty-armed Dhananjaya<br>did not fall off from a kshatriya's duties. Arjuna is possessed of such<br>patience, and such honesty. He is, besides, conversant with every weapon,<br>Why dost thou seek to compass the destruction of such a person with all<br>his brothers? That region where the weapon called brahmashira is baffled<br>by another high weapon suffers a drought for twelve years, for the clouds<br>do not pour a drop of water there for this period. For this reason, the<br>mighty-armed son of Pandu, although he had the power, would not, from<br>desire of doing good to living creatures, baffle thy weapon with his. The<br>Pandavas should be protected; thy own self should be protected; the<br>kingdom also should be protected. Therefore, O thou of mighty arms,<br>withdraw this celestial weapon of thine. Dispel this wrath from thy heart<br>and let the Pandavas be safe. The royal sage Yudhishthira never desires<br>to win victory by perpetrating any sinful act. Give unto these that gem<br>which is on thy head. Taking that, the Pandavas will in return grant thee<br>thy life!"<br><br>Drona's son said, "This my gem is more valuable than all the wealth that<br>has ever been earned by the Pandavas and the Kauravas. If this gem is<br>worn, the wearer ceases to have any fear from weapons or disease or<br>hunger! He ceases to have any fear of gods and danavas and nagas! His<br>apprehensions from rakshasas as also from robbers will cease. Even these<br>are the virtues of this gem of mine. I cannot, by any means, part with<br>it. That, however, O holy one, which thou sayest, should be done by me.<br>Here is this gem. Here is myself. This blade of grass (inspired into a<br>fatal weapon) will, however, fall into the wombs of the Pandava women,<br>for this weapon is high and mighty, and incapable of being frustrated. O<br>regenerate one, I am unable to withdraw it, having once let it off. I<br>will now throw this weapon into the wombs of the Pandava women. As<br>regards thy commands in other respects, O holy one, I shall certainly<br>obey them."<br><br>Vyasa said, "Do then this. Do not, however, entertain any other purpose,<br>O sinless one! Throwing this weapon into the wombs of the Pandava women,<br>stop thyself."<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "The son of Drona, having heard these words of<br>the island-born, threw that uplifted weapon into the wombs of the Pandava<br>women."
