                            Vaishampayana said, "After the irresistible Bhimasena had set out, that<br>bull of Yadu's race, possessed of eyes like lotus-petals, addressed<br>Kuru's son Yudhishthira, saying, O son of Pandu, this brother of thine,<br>overwhelmed with grief at the slaughter of his sons, proceedeth alone to<br>battle, from desire of slaying the son of Drona. O bull of Bharata's<br>race, of all thy brothers, Bhima is thy dearest! Beholding him fallen<br>into a great danger why dost thou not stir thyself? The weapon called<br>brahmashira, which that subjugator of hostile towns, Drona, communicated<br>to his son, is capable of consuming the whole world. The illustrious and<br>highly blessed preceptor, that foremost of all wielders of bows,<br>delighted with Dhananjaya, had given him that very weapon. Unable to<br>endure it, his only son then begged it of him. Unwillingly he imparted<br>the knowledge of that weapon to Ashvatthama. The illustrious Drona knew<br>the restlessness of his son. Acquainted with all duties, the preceptor<br>laid this command on him, saying, "Even when overtaken by the greatest<br>danger, O child in the midst of battle, thou shouldst never use this<br>weapon, particularly against human beings." Even thus the preceptor Drona<br>spoke unto his son. A little while after he again spoke, saying, "O bull<br>among men, thou wilt not, it seems, walk in the path of the righteous."<br>Hearing those bitter words of his sire, the wicked-souled Ashvatthama, in<br>despair of obtaining every kind of prosperity, began in grief to wander<br>over the earth.<br><br>Then, O chief of the Kurus, while you were living in the woods, O<br>Bharata, he came to Dvaraka and took up his abode there, worshipped by<br>the Vrishnis. One day, after he had taken up his abode in Dvaraka, he<br>came to me, without a companion and when I myself was without anybody by<br>my side, on the seacoast, and there smilingly addressing me said, "O<br>Krishna, that weapon, called brahmashira, worshipped by gods and<br>gandharvas, which my sire, the preceptor of the Bharatas, of prowess<br>incapable of being baffled, and obtained from Agastya after performing<br>the austerest penances, is now with me, O Dasharha, as much as it is with<br>my sire. O foremost one of Yadu's race, in exchange for that celestial<br>weapon, give me thy discus which is capable of slaying all foes in<br>battle."<br><br>While he with joined palms and great importunity thus begged of me my<br>discus, myself, O bull of Bharata's race, from desire of gladdening him,<br>told him these words: "Gods, danavas, gandharvas, men, birds and snakes,<br>assembled together, are not equal to even a hundredth part of my energy.<br>I have this bow, this dart, this discus, and this mace. I will give thee<br>whichever amongst these thou desirest to have from me. Without giving me<br>the weapon thou wishest to give, take from among these weapons of mine<br>whichever thou mayest be able to wield and use in battle."<br><br>Thus addressed, the illustrious son of Drona, as if challenging me,<br>solicited at my hands my discus of excellent nave and hard as thunder,<br>possessed of a 1,000 spokes, and made of iron "Take it." I said unto him.<br>Thus addressed, he rose suddenly and seized the discus with his left<br>hand. He failed, however, to even move the weapon from the spot on which<br>it lay. He then made preparations for seizing it with his right hand.<br>Having seized it then very firmly and having put forth all his strength,<br>he still failed to either wield or move it. At this, Drona's son became<br>filled with sorrow. After he was tired with the exertions he made, he<br>ceased, O Bharata!<br><br>When he withdrew his heart from that purpose, I addressed the anxious and<br>senseless Ashvatthama and said, "He who is always regarded as the<br>foremost of all human beings, that wielder of gandiva, that warrior<br>having white steeds yoked unto his car, that hero owning the prince of<br>apes for the device on his standard, that hero who, desirous of<br>vanquishing in a wrestling encounter the god of gods, the blue-throated<br>lord of Uma, gratified the great Shankara himself, that Phalguna than<br>whom I have no dearer friend on earth, that friend to whom there is<br>nothing that I cannot give including my very wives and children, that<br>dear friend Partha of unstained acts, never said unto me, O brahmana,<br>such words as these which thou hast uttered.<br><br>That son whom I obtained through ascetic penances and observances of<br>austere brahmacarya for twelve years on the breast of Himavati whither I<br>had gone for the purpose, that son of mine, Pradyumna, of great energy<br>and a portion of Sanat-kumara himself, begotten by me upon my wife<br>Rukmini who had practised vows as austere as mine, that hero even never<br>solicited this best of objects, this unrivalled discus, which thou of<br>little understanding had solicited!<br><br>Rama of great might never said such words to me! Neither Gada nor Samba<br>has ever asked that of me which thou hast asked! No one among the other<br>great car-warriors of the Vrishni and the Andhaka race residing in<br>Dvaraka has ever asked this of me which thou hast asked! Thou art the son<br>of the preceptor of the Bharatas, thou art held in high respect by all<br>the Yadavas. Let me ask thee, O foremost of car-warriors, with whom<br>wouldst thou fight using this weapon?"<br><br>Thus addressed by me, Drona's son replied, saying, "After offering<br>worship to thee, O Krishna, it was my intention to fight thee, O thou of<br>unfading glory! It was for this, O Krishna that I solicited thee for thy<br>discus which is adored by gods and danavas. If I had got it I would then<br>become invincible in the world. Having failed, O Keshava, in obtaining my<br>almost unattainable wish, I am about to leave thee, O Govinda! Address me<br>in fair words now. This terrible weapon is held by thee that art the<br>foremost of all terrible persons. Unrivalled art thou for this weapon!<br>There is none else in this world capable of possessing it."<br><br>Having said these words unto me, the son of Drona, taking many couples of<br>steeds and much wealth and diverse kinds of gems, left Dvaraka. He is<br>wrathful, wicked-souled, restless, and very cruel. He knows the weapon<br>called brahmashira. Vrikodara should be protected from him!"
