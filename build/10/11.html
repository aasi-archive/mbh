                            Vaishampayana said, "Beholding his sons, grandsons, and friends all slain<br>in battle, the king's soul became overwhelmed with great grief, O<br>Janamejaya! Recollecting those sons and grandsons and brothers and<br>allies, a deep sorrow took possession of the illustrious monarch.<br>Senseless and trembling, his eyes were bathed in tears. His friends then,<br>themselves filled with anxiety, began to comfort him.<br><br>At that time, Nakula, skilled in executing errands, arrived there on his<br>car of solar effulgence, accompanied by the princess Krishna in great<br>affliction. She had been residing at Upaplavya. Having received that<br>heartrending intelligence about the slaughter of all her sons, she became<br>exceedingly agitated. Trembling like a plantain tree shaken by the wind,<br>the princess Krishna, arrived at the presence of Yudhishthira, fell down,<br>afflicted by grief. Her face, adorned with eyes resembling a couple of<br>full-blown lotuses, seemed to be darkened by grief like the Sun himself<br>when enveloped in darkness.<br><br>Beholding her prostrate on the earth, the wrathful Vrikodara, of prowess<br>incapable of being baffled, advancing hastily, raised her up and clasped<br>her with his arms. The beautiful lady, comforted by Bhimasena, began to<br>weep, and addressing the eldest son of Pandu with his brothers, said, "By<br>good luck, O monarch, having obtained the whole earth, thou shalt enjoy<br>her after the slaughter of thy brave sons in the observance of kshatriya<br>duties. By good luck, O son of Pritha, thou art happy at the thought of<br>having obtained the whole earth. By good luck, thy thoughts do not dwell<br>on Subhadra's son whose tread resembled that of an infuriated elephant.<br>By good luck, thou dost not, like myself while residing at Upaplavya,<br>recollect thy heroic sons slaughtered in the observance of kshatriya<br>duties. O son of Pritha, hearing of the slaughter of those sleeping<br>heroes by Drona's son of sinful deeds, grief burns me as if I were in the<br>midst of a fire. If Drona's son be not made to reap the fruit of that<br>sinful deed of his, if, putting forth your prowess in battle, thou dost<br>not take the life of that wretch of sinful deeds, along with the lives of<br>all his followers, then listen to me, ye Pandavas, I shall sit here in<br>praya!"<br><br>Having said these words, the helpless Krishna, the daughter of Yajnasena,<br>sat by the side of the eldest son of Pandu, king Yudhishthira the just.<br>The royal sage, Yudhishthira, of righteous soul, seeing his dear queen<br>sit in praya, addressed her, saying, "O auspicious lady, O thou that art<br>conversant with morality, all thy sons and brothers have righteously met<br>with a noble death. It behoveth thee not to grieve for them. As regards<br>Drona's son, he hath gone to a distant forest, O beautiful princess! How<br>shall thou O lady, make thyself sure of his fall in battle?"<br><br>Draupadi answered, "I have heard that Drona's son hath a gem on his head,<br>born with him. I shall see that gem brought to me after the slaughter of<br>that wretch in battle, Placing that gem on thy head, O king, I shall<br>endure to live. Even this is my resolve."<br><br>Having said these words unto the royal son of Pandu, the beautiful<br>Krishna approached Bhimasena and said these words of high purpose unto<br>him: "Remembering the duties of a kshatriya, O Bhima, it behoveth thee to<br>come to my rescue. Slay that man of sinful deeds like Maghavat slaying<br>Samvara. There is no one in this world who is equal to thee in prowess.<br>It is known throughout the world how on an occasion of great calamity<br>thou becamest at the town Varanavata the refuge of all the Parthas. When<br>again we were seen by Hidimba, it was thou that becamest our refuge in<br>the same way. Like Maghavat rescuing (his spouse) the daughter of Puloma,<br>thou didst rescue my afflicted self, in Virata's city, from a great<br>calamity. Like those great feats, O Partha, that thou didst achieve in<br>former days, slay now, O slayer of foes, the son of Drona and be thou<br>happy!"<br><br>Hearing these and other piteous lamentations of the princess, Kunti's<br>son, Bhimasena, of great might, could not endure them. He mounted upon<br>his great car adorned with gold and took his beautiful bow with arrow<br>placed on the string. Making Nakula his charioteer, and resolved upon<br>slaying the son of Drona, he began to stretch his bow and caused his<br>steeds to be urged without delay. Those steeds, fleet as the wind, thus<br>urged, O tiger among men, proceeded with great speed. Possessed of great<br>valour and unfading energy, Bhima set out from the Pandava camp and<br>proceeded with great celerity along the track of Ashvatthama's vehicle."
