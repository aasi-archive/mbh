                            Vaishampayana said, "At the very outset the mighty-armed hero of<br>Dasharha's race understood from signs the intention of Drona's son.<br>Addressing Arjuna, he said, O Arjuna, O son of Pandu, the time is come<br>for the use of that celestial weapon which is in thy memory, knowledge of<br>which was imparted to thee by Drona. For protecting thyself as also thy<br>brothers, O Bharata, shoot in this battle that weapon which is capable of<br>neutralising all weapons.'<br><br>Thus addressed by Keshava, Arjuna, that slayer of hostile heroes, quickly<br>alighted from the car, taking with him his bow with shaft fixed on the<br>string. Softly wishing good unto the preceptor's son and then unto<br>himself, and unto all his brothers, that scorcher of foes then bowed unto<br>all the gods and all his superiors and let off his weapon, thinking of<br>the welfare of all the worlds and uttering the words, Let Ashvatthama's<br>weapon be neutralised by this weapon!'<br><br>That weapon, quickly let off by the wielder of gandiva, blazed up with<br>fierce flames like the all-destroying fire that appears at the end of the<br>yuga. Similarly, the weapon that had been shot by Drona's son of fierce<br>energy blazed up with terrible flames within a huge sphere of fire.<br>Numerous peals of thunder were heard; thousands of meteors fell; and all<br>living creatures became inspired with great dread. The entire welkin<br>seemed to be filled with noise and assumed a terrible aspect with those<br>flames of fire. The whole earth with her mountains and waters and trees,<br>trembled. Then the two great rishis, Narada, who is the soul of every<br>creature, and the grandsire of all the Bharata princes (Vyasa), beholding<br>those two weapons scorching the three worlds, showed themselves there.<br>The two rishis sought to pacify the two heroes Ashvatthama and<br>Dhananjaya. Conversant with all duties and desirous of the welfare of all<br>creatures, the two sages, possessed of great energy, stood in the midst<br>of those two blazing weapons. Incapable of being overwhelmed by any<br>force, those two illustrious rishis, placing themselves between the two<br>weapons, stood like two blazing fires. Incapable of being checked by any<br>creature endued with life, and adorned by the gods and danavas, they two<br>acted in this way, neutralising the energy of the two weapons and doing<br>good to all the world.<br><br>The two rishis said, "Those great car-warriors who have fallen in this<br>battle were acquainted with diverse kinds of weapons. They, however,<br>never shot such a weapon upon human beings. What act of rashness is this,<br>ye heroes, that ye have done?"
