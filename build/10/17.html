                            Vaishampayana said, "After all the troops had been slain during the hour<br>of sleep by those three car-warriors, king Yudhishthira in great grief<br>said these words unto him of Dasharha's race: How, O Krishna, could my<br>sons, all of whom were mighty car-warriors, be slaughtered by the sinful<br>and wretched Ashvatthama of no great skill in battle? How also could<br>Drona's son slay the children of Drupada, all of whom were accomplished<br>in weapons, possessed of great prowess, and capable of battling with<br>hundreds of thousands of foes? How could he slay that foremost of<br>car-warriors, Dhrishtadyumna, before whom the great bowman Drona himself<br>could not appear? What act was done by the preceptor's son, O bull among<br>men, in consequence of which he succeeded in slaying, single-handed, all<br>our men in battle?'<br><br>The holy one said, "Verily, Drona's son had sought the aid of that<br>highest of all the gods, the eternal Mahadeva. It was for this that he<br>succeeded in slaying, single-handed, so large a number of warriors. If<br>Mahadeva be gratified, he can bestow even immortality. Girisha can give<br>such valour as will succeed in checking Indra himself. I know Mahadeva<br>truly, O bull of Bharata's race! I know also his various acts of old. He,<br>O Bharata, is the beginning, the middle, and the end of all creatures.<br>This entire universe acts and moves through his energy.<br><br>The puissant Grandsire, desirous of creating living creatures, saw Rudra;<br>and the Grandsire asked him, saying, "Create living creatures without<br>delay!" Thus asked, Rudra of tawny locks, saying, "So be it!" plunged<br>into the water and practised austerities for a long time, inasmuch as he<br>was sensible of the defects of living creatures. Having waited in<br>expectation of Rudra for a very long time, the Grandsire, by a fiat of<br>his will, invoked into existence another being for making him the creator<br>of all kinds of living things. Beholding Girisha plunged into the waters,<br>this (second) being said unto his sire, "If there be no being born before<br>me, then I will create living creatures!" His sire replied unto him,<br>saying, "There is no other first-born being besides thee! This Sthanu has<br>plunged into the water! Go and create living creatures, without any<br>anxiety!"<br><br>That being then created many living creatures, having Daksha for their<br>first, who created all these creatures of four kinds. As soon, however,<br>as they were created, they ran O king, towards their sire, afflicted with<br>hunger and desirous of devouring him. The second being whom Brahma had<br>created, thereupon ran towards him, desirous of protection from his own<br>offspring. And he said unto the Grandsire, "O illustrious one, protect me<br>from these, and let these creatures have their food assigned unto them!"<br>Then the Grandsire assigned herbs and plants and other vegetables as<br>their food, and unto those that were strong he assigned the weaker<br>creatures as the means of sustenance. Their sustenance having been thus<br>assigned, the newly-created creatures all went away to regions they<br>desired, and cheerfully multiplied by union with their respective species.<br><br>After the creatures had multiplied and the Grandsire had become well<br>pleased, the first-born rose from the water and beheld the living<br>creation. He saw that diverse kinds of creatures had been created and<br>that they had multiplied by their own energy. At this sight, Rudra became<br>angry and caused his procreative limb to disappear in the bowels of the<br>Earth. The unfading Brahma, soothing him by soft words, said unto him, "O<br>Sharva, what wert thou doing so long within the water? For what reason,<br>also hast thou caused thy limb of generation to disappear in the bowels<br>of the Earth?" Thus questioned, that lord of the universe wrathfully<br>answered the lord Brahman, "Somebody else has created all these<br>creatures! What purpose then would be served by this limb of mine? I have<br>by my austerities, O Grandsire, created food for all these creatures.<br>These herbs and plants also will multiply like those that will subsist<br>upon them!" Having said these words, Bhava went away, in cheerlessness<br>and rage, to the foot of the Menjavat mountains for practising severer<br>austerities."
