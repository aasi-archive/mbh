                            Sanjaya said, "The son of Drona, O monarch, having reflected thus,<br>descended from the terrace of his car and stood, bending his head unto<br>that supreme god. And he said, "I seek the protection of Him called Ugra,<br>Sthanu, Shiva, Rudra, Sharva, Ishana, Ishvara, Girisha; and of that<br>boon-giving god who is the Creator and Lord of the universe; of Him whose<br>throat is blue, who is without birth, who is called Shakra, who destroyed<br>the sacrifice of Daksha, and who is called Hara; of Him whose form is the<br>universe, who hath three eyes, who is possessed of multifarious forms,<br>and who is the lord of Uma; of Him who resides in crematoriums, who<br>swells with energy, who is the lord of diverse tribes of ghostly beings,<br>and who is the possessor of undecaying prosperity and power; of Him who<br>wields the skull-topped club, who is called Rudra, who bears matted locks<br>on his head, and who is a brahmacari. Purifying my soul that is so<br>difficult to purify, and possessed as I am of small energy, I adore the<br>Destroyer of the triple city, and offer myself as the victim. Hymned thou<br>hast been, deserving art thou of hymns, and I hymn to thy glory!<br><br>Thy purposes are never baffled. Thou art robed in skins; thou hast red<br>hair on thy head; thou art blue-throated; thou art unbearable; thou art<br>irresistible! Thou art pure; thou art the Creator of Brahman; thou art<br>Brahma; thou art a brahmacari; thou art an observer of vows; thou art<br>devoted to ascetic austerities; thou art infinite; thou art the refuge of<br>all ascetics; thou art multiform; thou art the leader of diverse tribes<br>of ghostly beings; thou art three-eyed; thou art fond of those beings<br>called companions; thou art always seen by the Lord of treasures; thou<br>art dear to Gauri's heart; thou art the sire of Kumara; thou art tawny;<br>thou hast for thy excellent bearer a bovine bull; thou art robed in a<br>subtle attire; thou art most fierce; thou art eager to adorn Uma; thou<br>art higher than all that is high; thou art higher than everything; there<br>is nothing higher than thou; thou art the wielder of weapons; thou art<br>immeasurable, and thou art the protector of all quarters; thou art cased<br>in golden armour; thou art divine; thou hast the moon as an ornament on<br>thy brow! With concentrated attention, I seek thy protection, O god! For<br>success in getting over this dreadful distress that is so difficult to<br>get over, I sacrifice unto thee, the purest of the pure, offering for thy<br>acceptance the (five) elements of which my body is composed!"<br><br>Knowing this to be his resolution in consequence of his desire to<br>accomplish his object, a golden altar appeared before the high-souled son<br>of Drona. Upon the altar, O king, appeared a blazing fire, filling all<br>the points of the compass, cardinal and subsidiary, with its splendour.<br>Many mighty beings also, of blazing mouths and eyes, of many feet, heads,<br>and arms, adorned with angadas set with gems, and with uplifted arms, and<br>looking like elephants and mountains, appeared there. Their faces<br>resembled those of hares and boars and camels and horses and jackals and<br>cows and bears and cats and tigers and pards and crows and apes and<br>parrots. And the faces of some were like those of mighty snakes, and<br>others had faces like those of ducks. And all of them were endued with<br>great effulgence. And the faces of some were like those of woodpeckers<br>and jays, O Bharata, and of tortoises and alligators and porpoises and<br>huge sharks and whales, and of lions and cranes and pigeons and elephants<br>and stags. Some had faces like those of ravens and hawks, some had ears<br>on their hands; some had a 1,000 eyes, some had very large stomachs, and<br>some had no flesh, O Bharata! And some, O king, had no heads, and some, O<br>Bharata, had faces like those of bears. The eyes of some were like fire,<br>and some had fiery complexions. The hair on the heads and bodies of some<br>were blazing and some had four arms, and some, O king, had faces like<br>those of sheep and goats. The colour of some was like that of conchs, and<br>some had faces that resembled conchs, and the ears of some were like<br>conchs, some wore garlands made of conchs, and the voices of some<br>resembled the blare of conchs. Some had matted locks on their heads, and<br>some had five tufts of hair, and some had heads that were bald. Some had<br>lean stomachs; some had four teeth, some had four tongues, some had ears<br>straight as arrows and some had diadems on their brows. Some had strings<br>of grass on their bodies, O monarch, and some had curly hair. Some had<br>head-gears made of cloth, some had coronets, some had beautiful faces,<br>and some were adorned with ornaments. Some had ornaments made of lotuses,<br>and some were decked with flowers. They numbered in hundreds and<br>thousands.<br><br>Some were armed with shataghnis, some with thunder, and some had mushalas<br>in their hands. Some had bhushundis, some had nooses, and some had maces<br>in their hands, O Bharata! On the backs of some were slung quivers<br>containing excellent shafts, and all were fierce in battle. Some had<br>standards with banners and bells, and some were armed with battle-axes.<br>Some had large nooses in their uplifted arms, and some had clubs and<br>bludgeons. Some had stout posts in their hands, some had scimitars, and<br>some had snakes with erect heads for their diadems. Some had large snakes<br>(wound round their upper arms) for angadas, and some had beautiful<br>ornaments on their persons. Some were begrimed with dust, some smutted<br>with mire, and all were attired in white robes and white garments. The<br>limbs of some were blue, while others had limbs that were tawny. And some<br>there were that were beardless. Those beings, called companions,<br>possessed of golden complexions, and filled with joy, played upon drums<br>and horns and cymbals and jharjharas and anakas and gomukhas. And some<br>sang and some danced about uttering loud sounds, and some leapt forward<br>and cut capers and jumped sideways. Endued with great fleetness, they ran<br>about most fiercely, the hair on their heads waving in the air, like huge<br>elephants infuriated with passion and frequently uttering loud roars.<br>Terrible, and of frightful mien and armed with lances and battle-axes,<br>they were attired in robes of diverse hues and decked with beautiful<br>garlands and unguents. Adorned with angadas decked with gems, and with<br>uplifted arms, they were endued with great courage. Capable of forcibly<br>slaying all foes, they were irresistible in prowess. Drinkers of blood<br>and fat and other animal matter, they subsisted on the flesh and entrails<br>of animals. Some had their locks tied in tall tufts above their heads.<br>Some had single tufts on their heads; some had rings on their ears; and<br>some had stomachs resembling earthen vessels used for cooking. Some were<br>of very short statures, and some were very high in stature. Some were<br>tall and very fierce. Some had grim features, some had long lips, and the<br>genital limbs of some were very long. Some had costly and diverse kinds<br>of crowns upon their heads; and some had bald heads, and the heads of<br>others were covered with matted locks.<br><br>They were capable of bringing down the firmament with the sun, moon, and<br>stars, on earth, and exterminating the four orders of created things.<br>They know not what it is to fear, and are capable of enduring the frowns<br>of Hara. They always act as they like, and are the lords of the lords of<br>the three worlds. Always engaged in merry sports, they are thorough<br>masters of speech and are perfectly free from pride. Having obtained the<br>eight kinds of divine attributes, they are never elated with pride. The<br>divine Hara is always filled with wonder at their feats. They are devout<br>worshippers of Mahadeva. Adored by them in thought, word, and deed, the<br>great god protects those worshippers of his, looking upon them, in<br>thought, word, and deed as children of his own loins. Filled with rage,<br>they always drink the blood and fat of all haters of Brahma. They always<br>drink also the soma juice endued with four kinds of taste. Having adored<br>the trident-bearing god with Vedic recitations, with brahmacarya, with<br>austerities, and with self-restraint, they have obtained the<br>companionship of Bhava. The divine Maheshvara, that lord of the past, the<br>present, and the future as also Parvati, eat with those diverse tribes of<br>mighty beings that partake of their own nature.<br><br>Causing the universe to resound with the peal of diverse kinds of<br>instruments, with noise of laughter, with loud sounds and shrieks and<br>leonine roar, they approached Ashvatthama. Uttering the praises of<br>Mahadeva and spreading an effulgent light all around, desirous of<br>enhancing the honour of Ashvatthama and the glory of the high-souled<br>Hara, and wishing to ascertain the extent of Ashvatthama's energy, and<br>desirous also of beholding the slaughter during the hour of sleep, armed<br>with terrible and fierce bludgeons and fiery wheels and battle-axes, that<br>crowd of strange beings, endued with terrible forms, came from every<br>side. They were capable of inspiring the three worlds with dread at their<br>sight. The mighty Ashvatthama, however, beholding them, felt no fear.<br>Drona's son, armed with bow, and with fingers cased in fences made of<br>iguana skins, himself offered up his own self as a victim unto Mahadeva.<br>Bows were the fuel, and sharp shafts were the ladles, and his own soul<br>possessed of great might was the libation, O Bharata, in that act of<br>sacrifice. The valiant and wrathful son of Drona then, with propitiating<br>mantras, offered up his own soul as the victim. Having with fierce rites<br>adored Rudra of fierce deeds, Ashvatthama with joined hands, said these<br>words unto that high-souled god.<br><br>Ashvatthama said, "Sprung from Angirasa's line, I am about to pour my<br>soul, O god, as a libation on this fire! Accept, O lord, this victim! In<br>this hour of distress, O Soul of the universe, I offer up my own self as<br>the sacrificial victim, from devotion to thee and with heart concentrated<br>in meditation! All creatures are in thee and thou art in all creatures!<br>Assemblage of all high attributes occur in thee! O lord, O thou art the<br>refuge of all creatures. I wait as a libation for thee, since I am unable<br>to vanquish my foes. Accept me, O god." Having said these words, Drona's<br>son, ascending that sacrificial altar on which a fire blazed brightly,<br>offered himself up as the victim and entered that blazing fire.<br><br>Beholding him stand immovable and with uplifted hands and as an offering<br>up to himself, the divine Mahadeva appeared in person and smilingly said,<br>"With truth, purity, sincerity, resignation, ascetic austerities, vows,<br>forgiveness, devotion, patience, thought, and word, I have been duly<br>adored by Krishna of pure deeds. For this there is none dearer to me than<br>Krishna. For honouring him and at his word I have protected the Pancalas<br>and displayed diverse kinds of illusion. By protecting the Pancalas I<br>have honoured him. They have, however, been afflicted by time. The period<br>of their lives hath run out."<br><br>Having said these words unto the high-souled Ashvatthama, the divine<br>Mahadeva entered Ashvatthama's body after giving him an excellent and<br>polished sword. Filled by that divine being, Drona's son blazed up with<br>energy. In consequence of that energy derived from godhead, he became<br>all-powerful in battle. Many invisible beings and rakshasas proceeded<br>along his right and his left as he set out, like the lord Mahadeva<br>himself, for entering the camp of his foes."
