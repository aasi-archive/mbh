                            Kripa said, "A person who is bereft of intelligence and who hath not his<br>passions under control, cannot, even if he waits dutifully upon his<br>superiors, understand all the considerations of morality. This is my<br>opinion. Similarly, an intelligent person who does not practise humility<br>fails to understand the settled conclusions of morality. A brave man, if<br>bereft of understanding, by waiting all his life upon a learned person<br>fails to know his duties, like a wooden ladle unable to taste the juicy<br>soup (in which it may lie immersed). The wise man, however, by waiting<br>upon a learned person for even a moment, succeeds in knowing his duties,<br>like the tongue tasting the juicy soup (as soon as it comes into contact<br>with the latter). That person who is endued with intelligence, who waits<br>upon his superiors, and who has his passions under control succeeds in<br>knowing all the rules of morality and never disputes with what is<br>accepted by all. An ungovernable, irreverent, and sinful person of wicked<br>soul perpetrates sin in seeking his well-being by disregarding destiny.<br><br>Well-wishers seek to restrain a friend from sin. He who suffers himself<br>to be dissuaded, succeeds in winning prosperity. He that does otherwise<br>reaps misery. As a person of disordered brains is restrained by soothing<br>words, even so should a friend be restrained by well-wishers. He that<br>suffers himself to be so restrained never becomes a prey to misery. When<br>a wise friend is about to perpetrate a wicked act, well-wishers possessed<br>of wisdom repeatedly and according to the extent of their power endeavour<br>to restrain him. Setting thy heart on what is truly beneficial, and<br>restraining thyself by thy own self, do my bidding, O son, so that thou<br>mayst not have to repent afterwards.<br><br>In this world, the slaughter of sleeping persons is not applauded,<br>agreeably to the dictates of religion. The same is the case with persons<br>that have laid down their arms and come down from cars and steeds. They<br>also are unslayable who say We are thine!' and they that surrender<br>themselves, and they whose locks are dishevelled, and they whose animals<br>have been killed under them or whose cars have been broken. All the<br>Pancalas will sleep tonight. O lord, divesting themselves of armour.<br>Trustfully sunk in sleep, they will be like dead men. That crooked-minded<br>man who would wage hostility with them then, it is evident, would sink in<br>deep and limitless hell without a raft save himself. In this world thou<br>art celebrated as the foremost of all persons conversant with weapons.<br>Thou hast not as yet committed even a minute trespass. When the sun rises<br>next morning and light shall discover all things, thyself, like a second<br>sun in effulgence wilt conquer the foe in battle. This censurable deed,<br>so impossible in one like thee, will look like a red spot on a white<br>sheet. Even this is my opinion."<br><br>Ashvatthama said, "Without doubt, it is even so, O maternal uncle, as<br>thou sayest. The Pandavas, however, have before this broken the bridge of<br>righteousness into a hundred fragments. In the very sight of all the<br>kings, before thy eyes also, my sire, after he had laid down his weapons,<br>was slain by Dhrishtadyumna. Karna also, that foremost of car-warriors,<br>after the wheel of his car had sunk and he had been plunged into great<br>distress, was slain by the wielder of gandiva. Similarly, Shantanu's son<br>Bhishma, after he had laid aside his weapons and become disarmed, was<br>slain by Arjuna with Shikhandi placed in his van. So also, the mighty<br>bowman Bhurishrava, while observant of the praya vow on the field of<br>battle, was slain by Yuyudhana in total disregard of the cries of all the<br>kings! Duryodhana too, having encountered Bhima in battle with the mace,<br>hath been slain unrighteously by the former in the very sight of all the<br>lords of earth. The king was all alone in the midst of a large number of<br>mighty car-warriors standing around him. Under such circumstances was<br>that tiger among men slain by Bhimasena. Those lamentations that I have<br>heard, of the king lying prostrate on the earth with his thighs broken,<br>from the messengers circulating the news, are cutting the very core of my<br>heart. The unrighteous and sinful Pancalas, who have broken down the<br>barrier of virtue, are even such. Why do you not censure them who have<br>transgressed all considerations? Having slain the Pancalas, those slayers<br>of my sire, in the night when they are buried in sleep, I care not if I<br>am born a worm or a winged insect in my next life. That which I have<br>resolved is hurrying me towards its accomplishment. Hurried as I am by<br>it, how can I have sleep and happiness? That man is not yet born in the<br>world, nor will be, who will succeed in baffling this resolution that I<br>have formed for their destruction."<br><br>Sanjaya continued, "Having said these words, O monarch, the valiant son<br>of Drona yoked his steeds to his car at a corner and set out towards the<br>direction of his enemies. Then Bhoja and Sharadvata's son, those<br>high-souled persons, addressed him, saying, "Why dost thou yoke the<br>steeds to thy car? Upon what business art thou bent? We are determined to<br>accompany thee tomorrow, O bull among men! We sympathise with thee in<br>weal and woe. It behoveth thee not to mistrust us. Remembering the<br>slaughter of his sire, Ashvatthama in rage told them truly about the feat<br>that he had resolved to accomplish. When my sire, having slain hundreds<br>and thousands of warriors with keen shafts, had laid aside his weapons,<br>he was then slain by Dhrishtadyumna. I shall slay that slayer today in a<br>similar condition that is, when he will have laid aside his armour. The<br>sinful son of the king of the Pancalas I shall today slay by a sinful<br>act. It is my resolve to slay like an animal that sinful prince of the<br>Pancalas in such a way that he may not attain to regions earned by<br>persons slain with weapons! Put on your coats of mail without delay and<br>take your bows and swords, and wait for me here, ye foremost of<br>car-warrior and scorchers of foes."<br><br>Having said these words, Ashvatthama got upon his car and set out towards<br>the direction of the enemy. Then Kripa, O king, and Kritavarma of the<br>Satvata race, both followed him. While the three proceeded against the<br>enemy, they shone like three blazing fires in a sacrifice, fed with<br>libations of clarified butter. They proceeded, O lord, towards the camp<br>of the Pancalas within which everybody was asleep. Having approached the<br>gate, Drona's son, that mighty car-warrior, stopped."
