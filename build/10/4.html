                            Kripa said, "By good luck, O thou of unfading glory, thy heart is set<br>today on vengeance. The wielder of the thunder himself will not succeed<br>in dissuading thee today. Both of us, however, shall accompany thee in<br>the morning. Putting off thy armour and taking down thy standard, take<br>rest for this night. I shall accompany thee, as also Kritavarma of the<br>Satvata race, clad in mail and riding on our cars, while thou shalt<br>proceed against the foe. United with ourselves, thou shalt slay the foes,<br>the Pancalas with all their followers, tomorrow in press of battle,<br>putting forth thy prowess, O foremost of car-warriors! If thou puttest<br>forth thy prowess, thou art quite competent to achieve that fear! Take<br>rest, therefore, for this night. Thou hast kept thyself awake for many a<br>night. Having rested and slept, and having become quite refreshed, O<br>giver of honours, encounter the foe in battle! Thou shalt then slay the<br>enemy, without doubt. No one, not even Vasava amongst the gods, would<br>venture to vanquish thee armed with foremost of weapons, O first of<br>car-warriors! Who is there that would, even if he be the chief of the<br>gods himself, fight Drona's son, when the latter proceeds, accompanied by<br>Kripa and protected by Kritavarma? Therefore, having rested and slept<br>this night and shaken off fatigue, we shall slay the foe tomorrow<br>morning! Thou art a master of celestial weapons. I also am so, without<br>doubt. This hero of Satvata's race is a mighty bowman, always skilled in<br>battle. All of us, uniting together, O son, shall succeed in slaying our<br>assembled foes in battle by putting forth our might. Great shall be our<br>happiness then! Dispelling thy anxieties, rest for this night and sleep<br>happily! Myself and Kritavarma, both armed with bows and capable of<br>scorching our enemies, will, clad in mail, follow thee, O best of men,<br>while thou shalt proceed on thy car against the enemy. Proceeding to<br>their camp and proclaiming thy name in battle, thou shalt then make a<br>great slaughter of the foe. Tomorrow morning, in broad daylight, having<br>caused a great slaughter among them thou shalt sport like Shakra after<br>the slaughter of great asuras. Thou art quite competent to vanquish the<br>army of the Pancalas in battle like the slayer of the danavas in<br>vanquishing in rage the danava host. United with myself in battle and<br>protected by Kritavarma, thou art incapable of being withstood by the<br>wielder of the thunderbolt himself.<br><br>Neither I, O son, nor Kritavarma, will ever retreat from battle without<br>having vanquished the Pandavas! Having slain the angry Pancalas along<br>with the Pandavas, we shall come away, or slain by them, we shall proceed<br>to heaven. By every means in our power, we two shall render thee<br>assistance in battle tomorrow morning. O thou of mighty arms, I tell thee<br>the truth, O sinless one!"<br><br>Addressed in these beneficial words by his maternal uncle, the son of<br>Drona, with eyes red in rage, answered his uncle, O king, saying, Where<br>can a person that is afflicted, or one that is under the influence of<br>rage, or one whose heart is always engaged in revolving projects for the<br>acquisition of wealth, or one that is under the power of lust, obtain<br>sleep? Behold, all these four causes are present in my case. Anyone of<br>these, singly would destroy sleep. How great is the grief of that person<br>whose heart is always thinking of the slaughter of his sire! My heart is<br>now burning day and night. I fail to obtain peace. The way in which my<br>sire in particular was slain by those sinful wretches hath been witnessed<br>by you all. The thought of that slaughter is cutting all my vitals. How<br>could a person like me live for even a moment after hearing the Pancalas<br>say that they have slain my father? I cannot bear the thought of<br>supporting life without having slain Dhrishtadyumna in battle. In<br>consequence of the slaughter of my father he hath become slayable by me,<br>as also all with whom he is united. Who is there so hard-hearted that<br>would not burn after having heard the lamentations that I have heard of<br>the king lying with broken thighs? Who is there so destitute of<br>compassion whose eyes would not be filled with tears after hearing such<br>words uttered by the king with broken thighs? They whose side was adopted<br>by me have been vanquished. The thought of this enhances my sorrow as a<br>rush of waters enhances the sea.<br><br>Protected as they are by Vasudeva and Arjuna, I regard them, O uncle, to<br>be irresistible by the great Indra himself. I am unable to restrain this<br>rising wrath in my heart. I do not behold the man in this world that can<br>assuage this wrath of mine! The messengers informed me of the defeat of<br>my friends and the victory of the Pandavas. That is burning my heart.<br>Having however, caused a slaughter of my enemies during their sleep, I<br>shall then take rest and shall then sleep without anxiety."
