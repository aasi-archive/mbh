                            Dhritarashtra said, "Seeing Drona's son stop at the gate of the<br>encampment, what, O Sanjaya, did those two mighty car-warriors, Kripa and<br>Kritavarma, do? Tell me this!"<br><br>Sanjaya said, "Inviting Kritavarma, as also the mighty car-warrior Kripa,<br>Drona's son, filled with rage, approached the gate of the camp. He there<br>beheld a being of gigantic frame, capable of making the very hair stand<br>on end, and possessed of the effulgence of the Sun or the Moon, guarding<br>the entrance. Round his loins was a tiger-skin dripping with blood, and<br>he had a black deer for his upper garment. He had for his sacred thread a<br>large snake. His arms were long and massive and held many kinds of<br>uplifted weapons. He had for his angadas a large snake wound round his<br>upper arm. His mouth seemed to blaze with flames of fire. His teeth made<br>his face terrible to behold. His mouth was open and dreadful. His face<br>was adorned with thousands of beautiful eyes. His body was incapable of<br>being described, as also his attire. The very mountains, upon beholding<br>him, would split into a 1,000 fragments. Blazing flames of fire seemed to<br>issue from his mouth and nose and ears and all those thousands of eyes.<br>From those blazing flames hundreds and thousands of Hrishikeshas issued,<br>armed with conchs and discs and maces.<br><br>Beholding that extraordinary being capable of inspiring the whole world<br>with terror, Drona's son, without feeling any agitation, covered him with<br>showers of celestial weapons. That being, however, devoured all those<br>shafts shot by Drona's son. Like the vadava fire devouring the waters of<br>the ocean, that being devoured the shafts sped by the son of Drona.<br>Beholding his arrowy showers prove fruitless, Ashvatthama hurled at him a<br>long dart blazing like a flame of fire. That dart of blazing point,<br>striking against that being, broke into pieces like a huge meteor at the<br>end of the yuga breaking and falling down from the firmament after<br>striking against the Sun. Ashvatthama then, without losing a moment, drew<br>from its sheath an excellent scimitar of the colour of the sky and endued<br>with a golden hilt. The scimitar came out like a blazing snake from its<br>hole. The intelligent son of Drona then hurled that excellent scimitar at<br>that being. The weapon, approaching that being, disappeared within his<br>body like a mongoose disappearing in its hole. Filled with rage, the son<br>of Drona then hurled a blazing mace of the proportions of a pole set up<br>in honour of Indra. The being devoured that mace also.<br><br>At last, when all his weapons were exhausted Ashvatthama, casting his<br>eyes around, beheld the whole firmament densely crowded with images of<br>Janardana. Drona's son, divested of weapons, beholding that wonderful<br>sight, recollected the words of Kripa, and turning pale with grief, said,<br>"He that listens not to the beneficial words of advising friends is<br>obliged to repent, being overwhelmed with calamity, even as my foolish<br>self for having disregarded my two well-wishers. That fool who,<br>disregarding the way pointed out by the scriptures, seeketh to slay his<br>enemies, falleth off from the path of righteousness and is lost in the<br>trackless wilderness of sin. One should not cast weapons upon kine,<br>brahmanas, kings, women, friends, one's own mother, one's own preceptor,<br>a weak man, an idiot, a blind man, a sleeping man, a terrified man, one<br>just arisen from sleep, an intoxicated person, a lunatic and one that is<br>heedless. The preceptors of old always inculcated this truth upon men. I<br>have, however, by disregarding the eternal way pointed out by the<br>scriptures, and by essaying to tread in a wrong path, fallen into<br>terrible distress. The wise have called that to be a terrible calamity<br>when one falls back, through fear, from a great feat after having essayed<br>to achieve it. I am unable, by putting forth only my skill and might, to<br>achieve that which I have vowed.<br><br>Human exertion is never regarded more efficacious than destiny. If any<br>human action that is commenced does not succeed through destiny, the<br>actor becomes like one who falling off from the path of righteousness, is<br>lost in the wilderness of sin. The sages speak of defeat as foolishness<br>when one having commenced an act swerves from it through fear. In<br>consequence of the wickedness of my essay, this great calamity has come<br>upon me, otherwise Drona's son would never had been forced to hold back<br>from battle. This being, again whom I see before me, is most wonderful!<br>He stands there like the uplifted rod of divine chastisement. Reflecting<br>even deeply, I cannot recognise who this being is. Without doubt, that<br>being is the terrible fruit of this sinful determination of mine that I<br>had essayed to achieve unrighteously. He standeth there for baffling that<br>determination. It seems, therefore, that in my case this falling off from<br>fight had been ordained by destiny. It is not for me to exert for the<br>accomplishment of this my purpose unless destiny becomes favourable. I<br>shall, therefore, at this hour, seek the protection of the puissant<br>Mahadeva! He will dispel this dreadful rod of divine chastisement<br>uplifted before me. I will take the shelter of that god, that source of<br>everything beneficial, the lord of Uma, otherwise called Kapardin, decked<br>with a garland of human skulls, that plucker of Bhaga's eyes called also<br>Rudra and Hara. In ascetic austerities and prowess, he far surpasses all<br>the gods. I shall, therefore, seek the protection of Girisha armed with<br>the trident."
