                            Vaishampayana said, "Having said these words, that foremost of all<br>wielders of weapons, that delighter of all the Yadavas, mounted upon his<br>excellent car equipped with every kind of powerful weapons. Unto that<br>vehicle were yoked two pairs of foremost steeds of the Kamboja breed,<br>that were adorned with garlands of gold. The dhur of that best of cars<br>was of the hue of the morning sun. On the right was yoked the steed known<br>as Shaibya; on the left was placed Sugriva; the Parshni was borne by two<br>others called Meghapushpa and Balahaka. There was seen on that car a<br>celestial standard decked with gems and gold and created by the divine<br>Artificer, and standing high like the Maya (of Vishnu himself). Upon that<br>standard was Vinata's son (Garuda) shining with great splendour. Indeed,<br>that enemy of snakes perched on the standard-top of Keshava who is Truth<br>embodied.<br><br>Then Hrishikesha, that foremost of all bowmen, mounted on that car. After<br>him Arjuna of irresistible feats and Yudhishthira, the king of the Kurus,<br>ascended the same vehicle. Seated on that car, by the side of him of<br>Dasharha's race who wielded the bow called sharnga, the two sons of Pandu<br>looked exceedingly beautiful, like the twin Ashvinis seated by the side<br>of Vasava. Causing them to ascend on that car of his which was adored by<br>all the world, he of Dasharha's race urged those foremost of steeds<br>endued with great fleetness. Those steeds then suddenly flew, taking<br>after them that excellent vehicle ridden by the two sons of Pandu and by<br>that bull of Yadu's race. Endued with great speed, as those animals bore<br>away the wielder of sharnga, loud became the noise caused by their rush,<br>like that of birds coursing through the air.<br><br>Proceeding with great speed, they soon came up, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>with the mighty bowman Bhimasena in whose wake they had followed.<br>Although those great car-warriors met Bhima, they failed however to stop<br>that son of Kunti, as filled with wrath he proceeded fiercely towards the<br>foe. In the very sight of those illustrious and firm bowmen, Bhima, by<br>means of his very fleet steeds, proceeded towards the bank of the river<br>brought down by Bhagiratha. He beheld the high-souled and illustrious and<br>dark-complexioned and island-born Vyasa sitting near the edge of the<br>water in the midst of many rishis. And he also saw Drona's son of wicked<br>deeds sitting beside them, covered with dust, attired in a piece of cloth<br>made of kusha grass, and smeared all over with clarified butter. The<br>mighty-armed Bhimasena, the son of Kunti, taking up his bow with shaft<br>fixed on it, rushed towards Ashvatthama, and said, Wait, wait!'<br><br>Drona's son, beholding that terrible bowman coming towards him bow in<br>hand, and the two brothers on Janardana's car, became exceedingly<br>agitated and thought his hour had come. Of soul incapable of being<br>depressed, he called to his mind that high weapon (which he had obtained<br>from his sire). He then took up a blade of grass with his left hand.<br>Fallen into great distress, he inspired that blade of grass with proper<br>mantras and converted it into that powerful celestial weapon. Unable to<br>brook the arrows (of the Pandavas) and the presence of those wielders of<br>celestial weapons, he uttered in wrath these terrible words: For the<br>destruction of the Pandavas.' Having said these words, O tiger among<br>kings, the valiant son of Drona let off that weapon for stupefying all<br>the worlds. A fire then was born in that blade of grass, which seemed<br>capable of consuming the three worlds like the all-destroying Yama at the<br>end of the yuga."
