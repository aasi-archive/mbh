                            "Sanjaya said, 'During the progress of the fierce engagement, Bhima,<br>while fighting along, being encompassed by innumerable foes, addressed<br>his driver, saying, "Bear me into the midst of the Dhartarashtra host.<br>Proceed, O charioteer, with speed, borne by these steeds. I will despatch<br>all these Dhartarashtras to the presence of Yama." Thus urged by<br>Bhimasena, the charioteer proceeded, quickly and with great impetuosity,<br>against thy son's host to that spot whence Bhima desired to slaughter it.<br>Then a large number of Kaurava troops, with elephants and cars and horse<br>and foot, advanced against him from all sides. They then, from every<br>side, began to strike that foremost of vehicles belonging to Bhima, with<br>numerous arrows. The high-souled Bhima, however, with his own shafts of<br>golden wings, cut off all those advancing arrows of his enemies. Thus cut<br>off into two or three fragments with Bhima's arrows, those shafts,<br>equipped with golden wings, of his enemies, fell down on the earth. Then,<br>O king, amongst those foremost of Kshatriyas, struck with Bhima's shafts,<br>the elephants and cars and horse and foot, set up a loud wail, O monarch,<br>that resembled the din made by mountains when riven with thunder. Thus<br>struck by Bhima, those foremost of Kshatriyas, their limbs pierced with<br>Bhima's powerful shafts, rushed against Bhima in that battle from every<br>side, like new-fledged birds towards a tree. When thy troops thus rushed<br>against him, Bhima of furious impetuosity displayed all his vim like<br>Destroyer himself armed with a mace when he burns and exterminates all<br>creatures at the end of the Yuga. Thy soldiers were unable to resist in<br>that battle that fierce forcible energy of Bhima endued with fierce<br>impetuosity, like that of the Destroyer himself of wide open mouth when<br>he rusheth at the end of the Yuga for exterminating all creatures. Then,<br>O Bharata, like masses of clouds scattered by the tempest the Bharata<br>host, thus mangled and burnt in that battle by the high-souled Bhima,<br>broke and fled in fear in all directions. Then the mighty Bhimasena of<br>great intelligence once more cheerfully said unto his charioteer,<br>"Ascertain, O Suta, whether those assembled cars and standards that are<br>advancing towards me, are ours or the enemy's. Absorbed in battle, I am<br>unable to distinguish them. Let me not shroud our own troops with my<br>shafts. O Visoka, beholding hostile warriors and cars and the tops of<br>their standards on all sides, I am greatly afflicted. The king is in<br>pain. The diadem-decked Arjuna also has not yet come. These things, O<br>Suta, fill my heart with sorrow. Even this is my grief, O charioteer,<br>that king Yudhishthira the just should have gone away, leaving me in the<br>midst of the enemy. I do not know whether he, as also Vibhatsu, is alive<br>or dead. This adds to my sorrow. I shall, however, though filled with<br>great grief, destroy those hostile troops of great might. Thus<br>slaughtering in the midst of battle my assembled foes, I shall rejoice<br>with thee today. Examining all the quivers containing my arrows, tell me,<br>O Suta, ascertaining the matter well, what quantity of arrows is still<br>left on my car, that is, how much of what sort."<br><br>"'Thus commanded, Visoka said, "Of arrows, O hero, thou hast yet 60,000,<br>while thy razor-headed shafts number 10,000, and broad-headed ones number<br>as much. Of cloth-yard shafts thou hast still 2,000, O hero, and of<br>Pradaras thou hast still, O Partha, 3,000! Indeed, of the weapons, O son<br>of Pandu, the portion that still remains is not capable of being borne,<br>if placed on carts, by six bullocks. Shoot and hurl them, O learned one,<br>for of maces and swords and other weapons used with the arms alone, thou<br>hast thousands upon thousands, as also lances and scimitars and darts and<br>spears! Never fear that thy weapons will be exhausted."<br><br>"'Bhima said, "Behold, O Suta, today this awful battle in which<br>everything will be shrouded with my impetuous arrows sped fiercely from<br>my bow and, mangling all my foes, and in consequence of which the very<br>sun will disappear from the field, making the latter resemble the domains<br>of Death! Today, even this will be known to all the Kshatriyas including<br>the very children, O Suta, that Bhimasena hath succumbed in battle or<br>that, alone, he hath subjugated all the Kurus! Today, let all the<br>Kauravas fall in battle or let all the world applaud me, beginning with<br>the feats of my earliest years. Alone, I will overthrow them all, or let<br>all of them strike Bhimasena down. Let the gods that aid in the<br>achievement of the best acts bless me. Let that slayer of foes Arjuna<br>come here now like Sakra, duly invoked, quickly coming to a sacrifice.<br>Behold, the Bharata host is breaking! Why do those kings fly away? It is<br>evident that Savyasaci, that foremost of men, is quickly shrouding that<br>host with his shafts. Behold, those standards, O Visoka, and elephants<br>and steeds and bands of foot-soldiers are flying away. Behold, these<br>cars, assailed with shafts and darts, with those warriors riding on them,<br>are being scattered, O Suta! Yonder, the Kaurava host, assailed with the<br>shafts, equipped with wings of gold and feathers of peacocks, of<br>Dhananjaya, and resembling thunderbolts in force, though slaughtered<br>extensively, is repeatedly filling its gaps. There, cars and steeds and<br>elephants are flying away, crushing down bands of foot-soldiers. Indeed,<br>all the Kauravas, having lost their sense, are flying away, like<br>elephants filled with panic at a forest conflagration, and uttering cries<br>of woe. These huge elephants, again, O Visoka, are uttering loud cries,<br>assailed with shafts."<br><br>"'Visoka said, "How is it, O Bhima, that thou dost not hear the loud<br>twang of the yawning Gandiva stretched by Partha in wrath? Are these two<br>ears of thine gone? All thy wishes, O son of Pandu, have been fulfilled!<br>Yonder the Ape (on Arjuna's banner) is seen in the midst of the elephant<br>force (of the enemy). Behold, the string of Gandiva is flashing<br>repeatedly like lightning amid blue clouds. Yonder the Ape on<br>Dhananjaya's standard-top is everywhere seen to terrify hostile divisions<br>in this dreadful battle. Even I, looking at it, am struck with fear.<br>There the beautiful diadem of Arjuna is shining brilliantly. There, the<br>precious jewel on the diadem, endued with the splendour of the sun,<br>looketh exceedingly resplendent. There, beside him, behold his conch<br>Devadatta of loud blare and the hue of a white cloud. There, by the side<br>of Janardana, reins in hand, as he penetrates into the hostile army,<br>behold his discus of solar effulgence, its nave hard as thunder, and its<br>edge sharp as a razor. Behold, O hero, that discus of Keshava, that<br>enhancer of his fame, which is always worshipped by the Yadus. There, the<br>trunks, resembling lofty trees perfectly straight, of huge elephants, cut<br>off by Kiritin, are falling upon the earth. There those huge creatures<br>also, with their riders, pierced and split with shafts, are falling down,<br>like hills riven with thunder. There, behold, O son of Kunti, the<br>Panchajanya of Krishna, exceedingly beautiful and of the hue of the moon,<br>as also the blazing Kaustubha on his breast and his triumphal garland.<br>Without doubt, that first and foremost of all car-warriors, Partha, is<br>advancing, routing the hostile army as he comes, borne by his foremost of<br>steeds, of the hue of white clouds, and urged by Krishna. Behold those<br>cars and steeds and bands of foot-soldiers, mangled by thy younger<br>brother with the energy of the chief of the celestials. Behold, they are<br>falling down like a forest uprooted by the tempest caused by Garuda's<br>wings. Behold, four hundred car-warriors, with their steeds and drivers,<br>and seven hundred elephants and innumerable foot-soldiers and horsemen<br>slain in this battle by Kiritin with his mighty shafts. Slaughtering the<br>Kurus, the mighty Arjuna is coming towards thy side even like the<br>constellation Citra. All thy wishes are fulfilled. Thy foes are being<br>exterminated. Let thy might, as also the period of thy life, ever<br>increase."<br><br>"'Bhima said, "Since, O Visoka, thou tellest me of Arjuna's arrival, I<br>will give thee four and ten populous villages and a hundred female slaves<br>and twenty cars, being pleased with thee, O Suta, for this agreeable<br>intelligence imparted by thee!"'"
