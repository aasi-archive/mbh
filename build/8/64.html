                            "Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile Drona's son, surrounded by a large car-force, O<br>king, suddenly proceeded to that spot where Partha was. Like the<br>continent withstanding the surging ocean, the heroic Partha having Saurin<br>(Krishna) for his help-mate withstood the impetuously rushing<br>Ashvatthama. Then, O monarch, the valiant son of Drona, filled with rage,<br>covered both Arjuna and Vasudeva with his shafts. Beholding the two<br>Krishnas shrouded with arrows, the great car-warriors (of the Pandava<br>army), as also the Kurus that witnessed it, wondered exceedingly. Then<br>Arjuna, as if smiling, invoked into existence a celestial weapon. The<br>brahmana Ashvatthama, however, O Bharata, baffled that weapon in that<br>battle. Indeed, all those weapons that Arjuna sped from desire of slaying<br>the son of Drona were baffled by the latter, that great bowman, in that<br>encounter. During the progress of that awful encounter of weapons, O<br>king, we beheld the son of Drona to resemble the Destroyer himself, with<br>gaping mouth. Having covered all the points of the compass, cardinal and<br>subsidiary, with straight arrows, he pierced Vasudeva with three arrows<br>in the right arm. Then Arjuna, slaying all the steeds of his high-souled<br>assailant, caused the Earth in that battle to be covered with a river of<br>blood that was exceedingly awful that led towards the other world, and<br>that had diverse kinds of creatures floating on it. All the spectators<br>beheld a large number of car-warriors along with their cars, belonging to<br>the division of Ashvatthama, slain and destroyed by means of the arrows<br>sped from Partha's bow. Ashvatthama also, slaying his enemies, caused a<br>terrible river of blood to flow there that led to Yama's domains. During<br>the progress of that fierce and awful battle between Drona's son and<br>Partha, the combatants fought without showing any regard for one another,<br>and rushed hither and thither. In consequence of cars having their steeds<br>and drivers slain, and steeds having their riders slain, and elephants<br>having their riders and guides slain, an awful carnage, O king, was made<br>by Partha in that battle! Car-warriors, deprived of life with shafts sped<br>from Partha's bow, fell down. Steeds freed from their trappings ran<br>hither and thither. Beholding those feats of Partha, that ornament of<br>battle, that valiant son of Drona quickly approached the former, that<br>foremost of victorious men, shook his formidable bow decked with gold,<br>and then pierced him from every side with many sharp arrows. Once more<br>bending the bow, O king, the son of Drona cruelly struck Arjuna, aiming<br>at the chest, with a winged arrow. Deeply pierced by Drona's son, O<br>Bharata, in that encounter, the wielder of gandiva, that hero of great<br>intelligence forcibly covered the son of Drona with showers of arrows,<br>and then cut off his bow. His bow cut off Drona's son then, taking up a<br>spiked mace whose touch resembled that of thunder's, hurled it, in that<br>encounter, at the diadem-decked Arjuna. The son of Pandu, however, O<br>king, as if smiling the while, suddenly cut off that spiked mace decked<br>with gold, as it advanced towards him. Thus cut off with Partha's shafts,<br>it fell down on the Earth, like a mountain, O king, broken into pieces,<br>struck with the thunderbolt. Filled with rage at this, Drona's son, that<br>great car-warrior, began to cover Vibhatsu, aided by the energy of the<br>aindra weapon. Beholding that shower of arrows spread over the welkin<br>through the aindra weapon, Partha, endued with great activity, O king,<br>taking up his bow gandiva, and fixing on his bowstring a mighty weapon<br>created by Indra, destroyed that aindra-shower of arrows. Having baffled<br>that arrowy shower caused by the aindra weapon, Partha soon covered the<br>car of Drona's son (with his own arrows). The son of Drona, however,<br>overwhelmed with Partha's shafts, penetrated through that shower of<br>arrows shot by the son of Pandu, and approaching the latter, invoked a<br>mighty weapon and suddenly pierced Krishna with hundred shafts and Arjuna<br>with three hundred small arrows. Then Arjuna pierced the son of his<br>preceptor with a hundred arrows in all his vital limbs. And then he<br>poured many arrows on the steeds and driver and the bowstring of Drona's<br>son in the very sight of thy warriors. Having pierced Drona's son in<br>every vital part, Pandu's son, that slayer of hostile heroes, then felled<br>his adversary's driver from the car-niche with a broad-headed arrow.<br>Drona's son, however, himself, taking up the reins, covered Krishna with<br>many arrows. The activity of prowess that we then beheld in Drona's son<br>was exceedingly wonderful, since he guided his steeds while he fought<br>with Phalguni. That feat of his in battle, O king, was applauded by all<br>the warriors. Then Vibhatsu, otherwise called Jaya, smiling the while,<br>quickly cut off the traces of Ashvatthama's steeds in that battle, with a<br>razor-faced arrow. Already afflicted by the energy of Arjuna's shafts,<br>the steeds of Drona's son thereupon ran away. Then a loud noise arose<br>from thy troops, O Bharata! Meanwhile the Pandavas, having obtained the<br>victory, and desiring to improve it, rushed against thy troops, shooting<br>from all sides sharp arrows at them. The vast Dhartarashtra host, then, O<br>king, was repeatedly broken by the heroic Pandavas inspired with desire<br>of victory, in the very sight, O monarch, of thy sons, conversant with<br>all modes of warfare, and of, Shakuni the son of Subala, and of Karna, O<br>king! Though sought to be stopped, O king, by thy sons, that great army,<br>afflicted on all sides, stayed not on the field. Indeed, a confusion set<br>in among the vast terrified host of thy son in consequence of many<br>warriors flying away on all sides. The Suta's son loudly cried out,<br>saying "Stay, Stay!" but thy army, slaughtered by many high-souled<br>warriors, did not stay on the field. Loud shouts were uttered then, O<br>monarch, by the Pandavas, inspired with this desire of victory, on<br>beholding the Dhartarashtra host flying away on all sides. Then<br>Duryodhana addressing Karna from affection, "Behold, O Karna, how our<br>army, exceedingly afflicted by the Pandavas, though thou art here, is<br>flying away from battle! Knowing this, O thou of mighty arms, do that<br>which is suited to the hour, O chastiser of foes! Thousands of (our)<br>warriors, routed by the Pandavas, are O hero, calling after thee only, O<br>best of men!" Hearing these grave words of Duryodhana, the son of Radha,<br>as if smiling, said these words unto the ruler of the Madras, "Behold the<br>prowess of my arms and the energy of my weapons, O ruler of men! Today I<br>will slay all the Pancalas and the Pandavas in battle! Cause the steeds<br>to proceed with my car, O tiger among men! Without doubt, everything will<br>be as I have said!" Having said these words, the Suta's son of great<br>valour, that hero, taking up his ancient and foremost of bows called<br>Vijaya, stringed it and rubbed the string repeatedly. Bidding the troops<br>stay on the field after having assured them upon his truth and by an<br>oath, the mighty Karna of immeasurable soul fixed on his bow-string the<br>weapon known by the name of Bhargava. From that weapon flowed, O king,<br>millions and millions of keen arrows in that great battle. Entirely<br>shrouded with those blazing and terrible arrows winged with feathers of<br>Kankas and peacocks, the Pandava army could not see anything. Loud wails<br>of woe arose from among the Pancalas, O king, afflicted, in that battle,<br>with the mighty Bhargava weapon. In consequence then of elephants, O<br>king, and steeds, by thousands, and cars, O monarch, and men, falling on<br>all sides, deprived of life, the Earth began to tremble. The vast force<br>of the Pandavas became agitated from one extremity to another. Meanwhile<br>Karna, that scorcher of foes, that foremost of warriors, that tiger among<br>men, while consuming his foes, looked resplendent like a smokeless fire.<br>Thus slaughtered by Karna, the Pancalas and the Cedis began to lose their<br>senses all over the field like elephants during the conflagration in a<br>forest. Those foremost of men, O tiger among men, uttered loud roars like<br>those of the tiger. Loud became the wails of woe, like those of living<br>creatures at the universal dissolution that were uttered by those crying<br>combatants struck with panic and running wildly on all sides, O king, of<br>the field of battle and trembling with fear. Beholding them thus<br>slaughtered, O sire, by the Suta's son, all creatures, even beasts and<br>birds, were filled with fear. The Srinjayas then, thus slaughtered in<br>battle by the Suta's son, repeatedly called upon Arjuna and Vasudeva like<br>the spirits of the dead within Yama's dominions calling upon Yama to<br>rescue them. Hearing those wails of the troops slaughtered with Karna's<br>shafts, and beholding the terrible bhargava weapon invoked into existence<br>Kunti's son Dhananjaya said unto Vasudeva these words, "Behold, O Krishna<br>of mighty arms, the prowess of the bhargava weapon! It cannot, by any<br>means, be baffled! Behold the Suta's son also, O Krishna, filled with<br>rage in this great battle and resembling the Destroyer himself, in<br>prowess and employed in achieving such a fierce feat! Urging his steeds<br>incessantly, he is repeatedly casting angry glances upon me! I will never<br>be able to fly away from Karna in battle! The person that is living, may,<br>in battle, meet with either victory or defeat. To the man, however, that<br>is dead, O Hrishikesha, even death is victory. How can defeat be his that<br>is dead?" Thus addressed by Partha, Krishna replied unto that foremost of<br>intelligent men and chastiser of foes, these words that were suitable to<br>the occasion, "The royal son of Kunti hath been deeply wounded and<br>mangled by Karna. Having seen him first and comforted him, thou wilt<br>then, O Partha, slay Karna?" Then Keshava proceeded, desirous of<br>beholding Yudhishthira, thinking that Karna meanwhile, O monarch, would<br>be overwhelmed with fatigue! Then Dhananjaya, himself desirous of<br>beholding the king afflicted with arrows, quickly proceeded on that car,<br>avoiding the battle, at Keshava's command. While the son of Kunti was<br>thus proceeding from desire of seeing king Yudhishthira the just, he cast<br>his eyes on every part of the army but failed to find his eldest brother<br>anywhere on the field. The son of Kunti proceeded, O Bharata, having<br>fought with the son of his preceptor Drona, and having vanquished that<br>hero incapable of being resisted by the wielder of the thunderbolt<br>himself.'"
