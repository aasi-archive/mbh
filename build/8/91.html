                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then Vasudeva, stationed on the car, addressed Karna,<br>saying, "By good luck it is, O son of Radha, that thou rememberest<br>virtue! It is generally seen that they that are mean, when they sink into<br>distress, rail at Providence but never at their own misdeeds. Thyself and<br>Suyodhana and Duhshasana and Shakuni, the son of Subala, had caused<br>Draupadi, clad in a single piece of raiment, to be brought into the midst<br>of the assembly. On that occasion, O Karna, this virtue of thine did not<br>manifest itself. When at the assembly Shakuni, an adept in dice,<br>vanquished Kunti's son Yudhishthira who was unacquainted with it, whither<br>had this virtue of thine gone? When the Kuru king (Duryodhana), acting<br>under thy counsels, treated Bhimasena in that way with the aid of snakes<br>and poisoned food, whither had this virtue of thine then gone? When the<br>period of exile into the woods was over as also the thirteenth year, thou<br>didst not make over to the Pandavas their kingdom. Whither had this<br>virtue of thine then gone? Thou didst set fire to the house of lac at<br>Varanavata for burning to death the sleeping Pandavas. Whither then, O<br>son of Radha, had this virtue of thine gone? Thou laughedest at Krishna<br>while she stood in the midst of the assembly, scantily dressed because in<br>her season and obedient to Duhshasana's will, whither, then, O Karna, had<br>this virtue of thine gone? When from the apartment reserved for the<br>females innocent Krishna was dragged, thou didst not interfere. Whither,<br>O son of Radha, had this virtue of thine gone? Thyself addressing the<br>princess Draupadi, that lady whose tread is as dignified as that of the<br>elephant, in these words, viz., 'The Pandavas, O Krishna, are lost. They<br>have sunk into eternal hell. Do thou choose another husband!' thou<br>lookedest on the scene with delight. Whither then, O Karna, had this<br>virtue of thine gone? Covetous of kingdom and relying on the ruler of the<br>Gandharvas, thou summonedest the Pandavas (to a match of dice). Whither<br>then had this virtue of thine gone? When many mighty car-warriors,<br>encompassing the boy Abhimanyu in battle, slew him, whither had this<br>virtue of thine then gone? If this virtue that thou now invokest was<br>nowhere on those occasions, what is the use then of parching thy palate<br>now, by uttering that word? Thou art now for the practice of virtue, O<br>Suta, but thou shalt not escape with life. Like Nala who was defeated by<br>Pushkara with the aid of dice but who regained his kingdom by prowess,<br>the Pandavas, who are free from cupidity, will recover their kingdom by<br>the prowess of their arms, aided with all their friends. Having slain in<br>battle their powerful foes, they, with the Somakas, will recover their<br>kingdom. The Dhartarashtras will meet with destruction at the hands of<br>those lions among men (viz., the sons of Pandu), that are always<br>protected by virtue!'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed, O Bharata, by Vasudeva, Karna hung<br>down his head in shame and gave no answer. With lips quivering in rage,<br>he raised his bow, O Bharata, and, being endued with great energy and<br>prowess, he continued to fight with Partha. Then Vasudeva, addressing<br>Phalguna, that bull among men, said, "O thou of great might, piercing<br>Karna with a celestial weapon, throw him down." Thus addressed by the<br>holy one, Arjuna became filled with rage. Indeed, remembering the<br>incidents alluded to by Krishna, Dhananjaya blazed up with fury. Then, O<br>king, blazing flames of fire seemed to emanate from all the pores of the<br>angry Partha's body. The sight seemed to be exceedingly wonderful.<br>Beholding it, Karna, invoking the brahmastra, showered his shafts upon<br>Dhananjaya, and once more made an effort to extricate his car. Partha<br>also, by the aid of the brahmastra, poured arrowy downpours upon Karna.<br>Baffling with his own weapon the weapon of his foe, the son of Pandu<br>continued to strike him. The son of Kunti then, aiming at Karna sped<br>another favourite weapon of his that was inspired with the energy of<br>Agni. Sped by Arjuna, that weapon blazed up with its own energy. Karna,<br>however, quenched that conflagration with the Varuna weapon. The Suta's<br>son also, by the clouds he created, caused all the points of the compass<br>to be shrouded with a darkness such as may be seen on a rainy day. The<br>son of Pandu, endued with great energy, fearlessly dispelled those clouds<br>by means of the Vayavya weapon in the very sight of Karna. The Suta's son<br>then, for slaying the son of Pandu, took up a terrible arrow blazing like<br>fire. When that adored shaft was fixed on the bow-string, the earth, O<br>king, trembled with her mountains and waters and forests. Violent winds<br>began to blow, bearing hard pebbles. All the points of the compass became<br>enveloped with dust. Wails of grief, O Bharata, arose among the gods in<br>the welkin. Beholding that shaft aimed by the Suta's son, O sire, the<br>Pandavas, with cheerless hearts, gave themselves up to great sorrow. That<br>shaft of keen point and endued with the effulgence of Sakra's thunder,<br>sped from Karna's arms, fell upon Dhananjaya's chest and penetrated it<br>like a mighty snake penetrating an ant-hill. That grinder of foes, viz.,<br>the high-souled Vibhatsu, thus deeply pierced in that encounter, began to<br>reel. His grasp became loosened, at which his bow Gandiva dropped from<br>his hand. He trembled like the prince of mountains in an earthquake.<br>Availing himself of that opportunity, the mighty car-warrior Vrisha,<br>desirous of extricating his car-wheel that had been swallowed up by the<br>earth, jumped down from his vehicle. Seizing the wheel with his two arms<br>he endeavoured to drag it up, but though possessed of great strength, he<br>failed in his efforts, as destiny would have it. Meanwhile the<br>diadem-decked and high-souled Arjuna, recovering his senses, took up a<br>shaft, fatal as the rod of Death, and called anjalika. Then Vasudeva,<br>addressing Partha, said, "Cut off with thy arrow the head of this enemy<br>of thine, viz., Vrisha, before he succeeds in getting upon his car."<br>Applauding those words of the lord Vasudeva, and while the wheel of his<br>enemy was still sunk, the mighty car-warrior Arjuna took up a<br>razor-headed arrow of blazing effulgence and struck the standard (of<br>Karna) bearing the elephant's rope and bright as the spotless sun. That<br>standard bearing the device of the costly elephant's rope, was adorned<br>with gold and pearls and gems and diamonds, and forged with care by<br>foremost of artists excelling in knowledge, and possessed of great<br>beauty, and variegated with pure gold. That standard always used to fill<br>thy troops with high courage and the enemy with fear. Its form commanded<br>applause. Celebrated over the whole world, it resembled the sun in<br>splendour. Indeed, its effulgence was like that of fire or the sun or the<br>moon. The diadem-decked Arjuna, with that razor-headed shaft, exceedingly<br>sharp, equipped with wings of gold, possessed of the splendour of fire<br>when fed with libations of clarified butter, and blazing with beauty, cut<br>off that standard of Adhiratha's son, that great car-warrior. With that<br>standard, as it fell, the fame, pride, hope of victory, and everything<br>dear, as also the hearts of the Kurus, fell, and loud wails of "Oh!" and<br>"Alas!" arose (from the Kuru army). Beholding that standard cut off and<br>thrown down by that hero of Kuru's race possessed of great lightness of<br>hand, thy troops, O Bharata, were no longer hopeful of Karna's victory.<br>Hastening then for Karna's destruction, Partha took out from his quiver<br>an excellent Anjalika weapon that resembled the thunder of Indra or the<br>rod of fire and that was possessed of the effulgence of the<br>thousand-rayed Sun. Capable of penetrating the very vitals, besmeared<br>with blood and flesh, resembling fire or the sun, made of costly<br>materials, destructive of men, steeds, and elephants, of straight course<br>and fierce impetuosity, it measured three cubits and six feet. Endued<br>with the force of the thousand-eyed Indra's thunder, irresistible as<br>Rakshasas in the night, resembling Pinaka or Narayana's discus, it was<br>exceedingly terrible and destructive of all living creatures. Partha<br>cheerfully took up that great weapon, in the shape of an arrow, which<br>could not be resisted by the very gods, that high-souled being which was<br>always adored by the son of Pandu, and which was capable of vanquishing<br>the very gods and the Asuras. Beholding that shaft grasped by Partha in<br>that battle, the entire universe shook with its mobile and immobile<br>creatures. Indeed, seeing that weapon raised (for being sped) in that<br>dreadful battle, the Rishis loudly cried out, "Peace be to the universe!"<br>The wielder of Gandiva then fixed on his bow that unrivalled arrow,<br>uniting it with a high and mighty weapon. Drawing his bow Gandiva, he<br>quickly said, "Let this shaft of mine be like a mighty weapon capable of<br>quickly destroying the body and heart of my enemy, if I have ever<br>practised ascetic austerities, gratified my superiors, and listened to<br>the counsels of well-wishers. Let this shaft, worshipped by me and<br>possessed of great sharpness, slay my enemy Karna by that Truth." Having<br>said these words Dhananjaya let off that terrible shaft for the<br>destruction of Karna, that arrow fierce and efficacious as a rite<br>prescribed in the Atharvan of Angiras, blazing with effulgence, and<br>incapable of being endured by Death himself in battle. And the<br>diadem-decked Partha, desirous of slaying Karna, with great cheerfulness,<br>said, "Let this shaft conduce to my victory. Shot by me, let this arrow<br>possessed of the splendour of fire or the sun take Karna to the presence<br>of Yama." Saying these words, Arjuna, decked with diadem and garlands,<br>cherishing feelings of hostility towards Karna and desirous of slaying<br>him, cheerfully struck his foe with that foremost of shafts which was<br>possessed of the splendour of the sun or the moon and capable of<br>bestowing victory. Thus sped by that mighty warrior, that shaft endued<br>with the energy of the sun caused all the points of the compass to blaze<br>up with light. With that weapon Arjuna struck off his enemy's head like<br>Indra striking off the head of Vritra with his thunder. Indeed, O king,<br>with that excellent Anjalika weapon inspired with mantras into a mighty<br>weapon, the son of Indra cut off the head of Vaikartana in the afternoon.<br>Thus cut off with that Anjalika, the trunk of Karna fell down on the<br>earth. The head also of that commander of the (Kaurava) army, endued with<br>splendour equal to that of the risen sun and resembling the meridian sun<br>of autumn, fell down on the earth like the sun of bloody disc dropped<br>down from the Asta hills. Indeed, that head abandoned with great<br>unwillingness the body, exceedingly beautiful and always nursed in<br>luxury, of Karna of noble deeds, like an owner abandoning with great<br>unwillingness his commodious mansion filled with great wealth. Cut off<br>with Arjuna's arrow, and deprived of life, the tall trunk of Karna endued<br>with great splendour, with blood issuing from every wound, fell down like<br>the thunder-riven summit of a mountain of red chalk with crimson streams<br>running down its sides after a shower. Then from that body of the fallen<br>Karna a light passing through the welkin penetrated the sun. This<br>wonderful sight, O king, was beheld by the human warriors after the fall<br>of Karna. Then the Pandavas, beholding Karna slain by Phalguna, loudly<br>blew their conchs. Similarly, Krishna and Dhananjaya also, filled with<br>delight, and losing no time, blew their conchs. The Somakas beholding<br>Karna slain and lying on the field, were filled with joy and uttered loud<br>shouts with the other troops (of the Pandava army). In great delight they<br>blew their trumpets and waved their arms and garments. All the warriors,<br>O king, approaching Partha, began to applaud him joyfully. Others,<br>possessed of might, danced, embracing each other, and uttering loud<br>shouts, said, "By good luck, Karna hath been stretched on the earth and<br>mangled with arrows." Indeed, the severed head of Karna looked beautiful<br>like a mountain summit loosened by a tempest, or a quenched fire after<br>the sacrifice is over, or the image of the sun after it has reached the<br>Asta hills. The Karna-sun, with arrows for its rays, after having<br>scorched the hostile army, was at last caused to be set by the mighty<br>Arjuna-time. As the Sun, while proceeding towards the Asta hills, retires<br>taking away with him all his rays, even so that shaft (of Arjuna) passed<br>out, taking with it Karna's life breaths. The death hour of the Suta's<br>son, O sire, was the afternoon of that day. Cut off with the Anjalika<br>weapon in that battle, the head of Karna fell down along with his body.<br>Indeed, that arrow of Arjuna, in the very sight of the Kaurava troops,<br>quickly took away the head and the body of Karna. Beholding the heroic<br>Karna thrown down stretched on the earth, pierced with arrows and bathed<br>in blood, the king of the Madras, went away on that car deprived of its<br>standard. After the fall of Karna, the Kauravas, deeply pierced with<br>shafts in that battle, and afflicted with fear, fled away from the field,<br>frequently casting their eyes on that lofty standard of Arjuna that<br>blazed with splendour. The beautiful head, graced with a face that<br>resembled a lotus of a 1,000 petals, of Karna whose feats were like those<br>of the thousand-eyed Indra, fell down on the earth like the<br>thousand-rayed sun as he looks at the close of day.'"
