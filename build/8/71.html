                            "Sanjaya said, 'Having heard these joyful words of king Yudhishthira,<br>Govinda of virtuous soul, that delighter of the Yadus, then addressed<br>Partha. The latter, however, having at the instance of Krishna addressed<br>those words unto Yudhishthira, became exceedingly cheerless for having<br>committed a trivial sin. Then Vasudeva, smiling, said unto the son of<br>Pandu, "What would have been thy condition, O Partha, if, observant of<br>virtue thou hadst slain the son of Dharma with thy sharp sword? Having<br>only addressed the king as thou, such cheerlessness hath possessed thy<br>heart. If thou hadst slain the king, O Partha, what wouldst thou have<br>done after that? Morality is so inscrutable, especially by persons of<br>foolish understanding. Without doubt great grief would have been thine in<br>consequence of thy fear of sin. Thou wouldst have sunk also in terrible<br>hell in consequence of the slaughter of thy brother. Gratify now this<br>king of virtuous behaviour, this foremost of all practisers of virtue,<br>this chief of Kuru's race. Even this is my wish. Gratifying the king with<br>devotion, and after Yudhishthira will have been made happy, we two will<br>proceed against the car of the Suta's son for fighting him. Slaying Karna<br>today with thy keen shafts in battle, do thou, O giver of honours, give<br>great happiness to Dharma's son. Even this, O mighty-armed one, is what I<br>think to be suitable to this hour. Having done this, thy purpose will be<br>achieved." Then Arjuna, O monarch, in shame, touched king Yudhishthira's<br>feet with his head. And he repeatedly said unto that chief of the<br>Bharatas, "Be pleased with me, Forgive, O king, all that I have said from<br>desire of observing virtue and from fear of sins.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Dhananjaya, that slayer of foes, lying weeping<br>at his feet, O bull of Bharata's race, king Yudhishthira the just raised<br>his brother. And king Yudhishthira, that lord of the earth, then embraced<br>his brother affectionately and wept aloud. The two brothers, of great<br>splendour, having wept for a long while, at last became freed from grief,<br>O monarch, and as cheerful as before. Then embracing him once more with<br>affection and smelling his head, the son of Pandu, exceedingly gratified,<br>applauded his brother Jaya and said, "O thou of mighty arms, in the very<br>sight of all the troops, my armour, standard, bow, dart, steeds, and<br>arrows, were cut off in battle, O great bowman, by Karna with his shafts,<br>although I exerted myself with care. Thinking of and seeing his feats in<br>battle, O Phalguna, I lose my energies in grief. Life itself is no longer<br>dear to me. If thou dost not slay that hero in battle today, I will cast<br>away my life breaths. What use have I with life?" Thus addressed, Vijaya,<br>replied, O bull of Bharata's race, saying, "I swear by Truth, O king, and<br>by thy grace, by Bhima, O best of men, and by the twins, O lord of the<br>earth, that today I shall slay Karna, in battle, or, being myself slain<br>by him fall down on the earth. Swearing truly, I touch my weapons."<br>Having said these words unto the king, he addressed Madhava, saying,<br>"Without doubt, O Krishna, I will slay Karna in battle today. Aided by<br>thy intelligence, blessed be thou, the slaughter of that wicked-souled<br>one is certain." Thus addressed, Keshava, O best of kings, said unto<br>Partha, "Thou art competent, O best of the Bharatas, to slay the mighty<br>Karna. Even this hath ever been my thought, O mighty car-warrior, as to<br>how, O best of men thou, wouldst slay Karna in battle." Endued with great<br>intelligence, Madhava once more addressed the son of Dharma, saying, "O<br>Yudhishthira, it behoveth thee to comfort Vibhatsu, and command him to<br>slaughter Karna of wicked soul. Having heard that thou hadst been<br>afflicted with shafts of Karna, myself and this one came hither, O son of<br>Pandu, for ascertaining thy plight. By good luck, O king, thou wert not<br>slain. By good luck thou wert not seized. Comfort thy Vibhatsu, and bless<br>him, O sinless one, with thy wishes for his victory.'"<br><br>"'Yudhishthira said, "Come, Come, O Partha, O Vibhatsu, and embrace me, O<br>son of Pandu. Thou hast told me beneficial words that deserved to be<br>said, and I have forgiven thee. I command thee, O Dhananjaya, go and slay<br>Karna. Do not, O Partha, be angry for the harsh words I said unto thee.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Then Dhananjaya, O king, bowed unto Yudhishthira by<br>bending his head, and seized with his two hands, O sire, the feet of his<br>eldest brother. Raising him and embracing him closely, the king smelt his<br>head and once more said these words unto him, "O Dhananjaya, O thou of<br>mighty arms, I have been greatly honoured by thee. Do thou ever win<br>greatness and victory.'"<br><br>"'Arjuna said, "Approaching Radha's son today that is proud of his might,<br>I shall slay that man of sinful deeds with my shafts in battle, along<br>with all his kinsmen and followers. He who, having bent the bow strongly,<br>afflicted thee with his shafts, I say, that Karna, will obtain today the<br>bitter fruit of that act of his. Having slain Karna, O lord of the earth,<br>I shall today come back from the dreadful battle to pay thee my respects<br>by walking behind thee. I tell thee this truly. Without having slain<br>Karna I shall not come back today from the great battle. Truly do I swear<br>this by touching thy feet, O lord of the universe.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Unto the diadem-decked (Arjuna) who was speaking in<br>that way, Yudhishthira, with a cheerful heart, said these words of grave<br>import, "Do thou obtain imperishable fame, and such a period of life as<br>accordeth with thy own desire, and victory, and energy, and the<br>destruction of thy foes. Let the gods grant thee prosperity. Obtain thou<br>all these to the measure desired by me. Go quickly to battle, and slay<br>Karna, even as Purandara slew Vritra for his own aggrandisement."'"
