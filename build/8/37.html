                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the mighty Karna take up his station from<br>desire of battle, the Kauravas, filled with delight, uttered loud shouts<br>from every side. With the beat of cymbals and the sound of drums, with<br>the whizz of diverse kinds of arrows and the roars of combatants endued<br>with great activity, all thy troops proceeded to battle, making death<br>only the point at which to stop. When Karna set out and the warriors of<br>the Kuru army were filled with joy, the Earth, O king, trembled and made<br>a loud noise. The seven great planets including the Sun seemed to proceed<br>against one another (for combat). Meteoric showers became noticeable and<br>all the quarters seemed ablaze. Thunders fell from a cloudless sky, and<br>fierce winds began to blow. Animals and birds in larger numbers kept thy<br>army to their right, foreboding great calamities. After Karna had set<br>out, his steeds tumbled down on the Earth. A frightful shower of bones<br>fell from the sky. The weapons (of the Kuru warriors) seemed to be<br>ablaze; their standards trembled; and their animals, O monarch, shed<br>copious tears. These and many other terrible and awful portents appeared<br>for the destruction of the Kurus. Stupefied by destiny, none of them<br>regarded those portents at all. Beholding the Suta's son setting out, all<br>the rulers of men (in the Kaurava army) cried victory to him. The<br>Kauravas regarded the Pandavas to have been already vanquished. That<br>slayer of hostile heroes, that foremost of car-warriors, viz.,<br>Vaikartana, as he stayed on his car recollecting the death of Bhishma and<br>Drona, blazed up with splendour like the Sun or fire. Reflecting on the<br>mighty feats of Partha, and burning with self-conceit and pride, and<br>blazing with wrath and breathing long and hard, he addressed Shalya and<br>said these words: "When stationed on my car and armed with my bow, I<br>would not take fright at Indra himself armed with the thunder and excited<br>with wrath. Beholding those great heroes headed by Bhishma lying on the<br>field of battle, do not feel any anxiety. Seeing even the faultless<br>Bhishma and Drona, equal unto Indra and Vishnu, those crushers of<br>foremost of cars and steeds and elephants, those heroes that were<br>unslayable, slain by the foe, I do not still experience any fear in this<br>battle. Acquainted with mighty weapons, and himself the foremost of<br>brahmanas, why, indeed, did not the preceptor slay in battle all foes,<br>seeing them destroy the mightiest of our kings with their drivers and<br>elephants and cars? Remembering that Drona in great battle, I tell you<br>truly, listen to me, ye Kurus, there is none amongst you, save myself,<br>that is competent to bear the advancing Arjuna, that warrior who<br>resembles Death himself in his fiercest form. In Drona were the skills<br>attendant on practice, and might, and bravery, and the highest of weapons<br>and policy. When even that high-souled one had to succumb to Death, I<br>regard all the others (of our army), strengthless and on the point of<br>death. In this world I do not find anything, even on reflection, to be<br>stable, in consequence of the inevitable connection of acts. When the<br>preceptor himself is dead, who then will indulge in the certain belief<br>that he will live till even today's sun-rise? When the preceptor was thus<br>slain by the enemy in battle, without doubt weapons, ordinary and<br>celestial, and might and prowess, and achievements and wise policy, are<br>not able to compass the happiness of man. In energy Drona was equal to<br>fire or the Sun, in prowess he resembled Vishnu or Purandara; in policy<br>he was equal to Brihaspati or Usana; irresistible as he was, weapons<br>could not yet protect him. When (our) women and children are weeping and<br>uttering loud wails, when the valour of the Dhartarashtras has been<br>defeated, I know it, O Shalya, that it is I who am to fight. Proceed<br>therefore, against the army of our enemies. Who else, save myself, will<br>be able to bear those troops amongst whom are stationed the royal son of<br>Pandu firm in truth, and Bhimasena and Arjuna, and Satyaki, and the<br>twins? Therefore, O ruler of the Madras, proceed quickly, in this battle,<br>towards the Pancalas, the Pandavas, and the Srinjayas. Encountering them<br>in battle, either I will slay them, or myself to Yama's presence by the<br>path taken by Drona. Do not think, O Shalya, that I will not go into the<br>very midst of those heroes. These intestine dissensions cannot be<br>tolerated by me. (Without seeking to tolerate them) I will even follow in<br>the wake of Drona. Wise or ignorant, when his period is run out,<br>everybody is equally regarded by the Destroyer; no one can escape, O<br>learned one, for this, I will proceed against the Parthas. I am unable to<br>transgress my destiny. The son of Vichitravirya's son is, O king, always<br>engaged in doing me good. For the accomplishment of his purpose, I will<br>cast away my life-breaths that are so dear, and this body that is so<br>difficult of being cast away. This foremost of cars covered with<br>tigerskins, with axle producing no sound equipped with a golden seat<br>endued with trivenu made of silver, and unto which are yoked these<br>foremost of steeds, Rama gave unto me. Behold, also, O Shalya, these<br>beautiful bows, these standards, these maces, these shafts of fierce<br>forms, this blazing sword, this mighty weapon, this white conch of fierce<br>and loud blare. Riding upon this car decked with banners, its wheels<br>producing a rattle deep as that of the thunder, having white steeds yoked<br>unto it, and adorned with excellent quivers, I will, putting forth my<br>might, slay in battle that bull among car-warriors, Arjuna. If Death<br>himself, that universal consumer, were to protect with vigilance the son<br>of Pandu in battle, I would still encounter him in fight and either slay<br>him or myself go to Yama's presence following Bhishma. If Yama, Varuna,<br>Kuvera, and Vasava, with all their followers coming hither, unitedly<br>protect the son of Pandu in this great battle, what need of many words, I<br>will still vanquish him with them.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing these words of the bragging Karna who was<br>exceedingly delighted with the prospect of battle, the valiant king of<br>the Madras, deriding him, laughed aloud, and gave him the following reply<br>for checking him.<br><br>"'Shalya said, "Forbear, forbear, O Karna, from such bragging. Thou art<br>in transports of delight and sayest what thou shouldst never say. Where<br>is Dhananjaya, that foremost of men, and where again, art thou, O lowest<br>of men? Who else, save Arjuna, could take away the younger sister of<br>(Keshava) that foremost of all persons, having forcibly agitated the home<br>of the Yadus that was protected by the younger brother of Indra and that<br>resembled heaven itself that is guarded by the chief of celestials? What<br>man save Arjuna who is endued with prowess that is equal to the prowess<br>of the chief of the celestials, could on the occasion of the dispute<br>caused by the slaughter of an animal, summon Bhava the Lord of Lords, the<br>Creator of the worlds, to battle? For the sake of honouring Agni, Jaya<br>had vanquished asuras and gods and great snakes and men and birds and<br>pishacas and yakshas and rakshasas with his shafts and gave unto that god<br>the food he had desired. Dost thou remember, O Karna, the occasion when,<br>slaughtering those foes in large numbers with his excellent shafts endued<br>with the effulgence of the Sun, Phalguna liberated Dhritarashtra's son<br>himself among the Kurus? Dost thou remember the occasion when, thyself<br>having been the first to fly away, the quarrelsome sons of Dhritarashtra<br>were liberated by the Pandavas after the latter had defeated those<br>rangers of the skies (the gandharvas headed by Citraratha)? On the<br>occasion also of the seizure of (Virata's) kine, the Kauravas, swelling<br>with numbers in respect of both men and animals, and having the preceptor<br>and the preceptor's son and Bhishma amongst them, were vanquished by that<br>foremost of men. Why, O son of Suta, didst thou not vanquish Arjuna then?<br>For thy destruction another excellent battle has now presented itself. If<br>thou dost not fly away from fear of thy enemy, know O Suta's son, that as<br>soon as thou goest to battle thou wilt be slain.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'When the ruler of the Madras was most heartily<br>engaged in addressing these harsh speeches to Karna and uttering these<br>praises of the latter's foe, that scorcher of foes, viz., the commander<br>of the Kuru army, excited with rage, said these words unto the Madra king.<br><br>"'Karna said, "Let it be so, let it be so. Why, however, dost thou<br>indulge in Arjuna's praises? A battle is about to ensue between myself<br>and him. If he vanquishes me in fight, then will these thy praises be<br>regarded as well-uttered.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'The ruler of the Madras said, "Let it be so," and<br>gave no reply. When Karna, from desire of fight, addressed Shalya,<br>saying, "Proceed," then that great carwarrior, having white steeds yoked<br>unto his vehicle and owning Shalya as his charioteer, proceeded against<br>his foes, slaying large numbers in battle along his way, like the Sun<br>destroying the darkness. Indeed, on that car covered with tiger-skins and<br>having white steeds yoked unto it, Karna proceeded with a cheerful heart,<br>and beholding the army of the Pandavas, speedily enquired after<br>Dhananjaya.'"
