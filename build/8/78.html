                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'When our troops were broken in battle by Bhimasena,<br>what, O Sanjaya, did Duryodhana and Subala's son say? Or, what did Karna,<br>that foremost of victors, or the warriors of my army in that battle, or<br>Kripa, or Kritavarma, or Drona's son Duhshasana, say? Exceedingly<br>wonderful, I think, is the prowess of Pandu's son, since, single-handed,<br>he fought in battle with all the warriors of my army. Did the son of<br>Radha act towards the (hostile) troops according to his vow? That slayer<br>of foes, Karna, O Sanjaya, is the prosperity, the armour, the fame, and<br>the very hope of life, of the Kurus. Beholding the army broken by Kunti's<br>son of immeasurable energy, what did Karna, the son of Adhiratha and<br>Radha, do in that battle? What also did my sons, difficult of defeat in<br>battle, do, or the other kings and mighty car-warriors of our army? Tell<br>me all this, O Sanjaya, for thou art skilled in narration!'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'In that afternoon, O monarch, the Suta's son of great<br>valour began to smite all the Somakas in the very sight of Bhimasena.<br>Bhima also of great strength began to destroy the Dhartarashtra troops.<br>Then Karna, addressing (his driver) Shalya, said unto him, "Bear me to<br>the Pancalas." Indeed, beholding his army in course of being routed by<br>Bhimasena of great intelligence, Karna once more addressed his driver,<br>saying, 'Bear me to the Pancalas only.' Thus urged, Shalya, the ruler of<br>the Madras, endued with great might, urged those white steeds that were<br>fleet as thought, towards the Cedis, the Pancalas and the Karushas.<br>Penetrating then into that mighty host, Shalya, that grinder of hostile<br>troops, cheerfully conducted those steeds into every spot that Karna,<br>that foremost of warriors, desired to go to. Beholding that car cased in<br>tiger skins and looking like a cloud, the Pandus and the Pancalas, O<br>monarch, became terrified. The rattle then of that car, like unto the<br>peal of thunder or the sound of a mountain splitting into fragments,<br>became audible in that dreadful battle. With hundreds upon hundreds of<br>keen arrows sped from the bow-string drawn to his ear, Karna then smote<br>hundreds and thousands of warriors belonging to the Pandava army. While<br>the unvanquished Karna was employed in achieving those feats, many mighty<br>bowmen and great car-warriors among the Pandavas encompassed him on all<br>sides. Indeed, Shikhandi, and Bhima, and Dhrishtadyumna, the son of<br>Prishata, and Nakula, and Sahadeva, and the (five) sons of Draupadi, and<br>Satyaki, surrounded the son of Radha, pouring showers of arrows upon him,<br>from desire of despatching him to the other world. The heroic Satyaki,<br>that best of men, struck Karna in that engagement with twenty keen shafts<br>in the shoulder-joint. Shikhandi struck him with five and twenty shafts,<br>and Dhrishtadyumna struck him with seven, and the sons of Draupadi with<br>four and sixty, and Sahadeva with seven, and Nakula with a hundred, in<br>that battle. The mighty Bhimasena, in that encounter, filled with rage,<br>struck the son of Radha in the shoulder-joint with ninety straight<br>shafts. The son of Adhiratha, then, of great might laughing in scorn, and<br>drawing his excellent bow let off many keen shafts, afflicting his foes.<br>The son of Radha pierced each of them in return with five arrows. Cutting<br>off the bow of Satyaki, as also his standard, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>Karna pierced Satyaki himself with nine shafts in the centre of the<br>chest. Filled with wrath, he then pierced Bhimasena with thirty shafts.<br>With a broad-headed arrow, O sire, he next cut off the standard of<br>Sahadeva, and with three other arrows, that chastiser of foes afflicted<br>Sahadeva's driver. Within the twinkling of an eye he then deprived the<br>(five) sons of Draupadi of their cars, O bull of Bharata's race, which<br>seemed exceedingly wonderful. Indeed, with his straight shafts casting<br>those heroes to turn back from the fight, the heroic Karna began to slay<br>the Pancalas and many mighty car-warriors among the Cedis. Thus struck in<br>that battle. O monarch, the Cedis and the Matsyas, rushing against Karna<br>alone, poured upon him showers of shafts. The Suta's son, however, that<br>mighty car-warrior, began to smite them with his keen shafts. I beheld<br>this exceedingly wonderful feat. O Bharata, viz., that the Suta's son of<br>great prowess, alone and unsupported in that battle, fought with all<br>those bowmen who contended with him to the utmost of their prowess, and<br>checked all those Pandava warriors, O monarch, with his shafts. With the<br>lightness of hand, O Bharata, of the high-souled Karna on that occasion,<br>all the gods as also the Siddhas and the Charanas were gratified. All the<br>great bowmen among the Dhartarashtras also, O best of men, applauded<br>Karna, that foremost of great car-warriors, that first of all bowmen.<br>Then Karna, O monarch, burnt the hostile army like a mighty and blazing<br>conflagration consuming a heap of dry grass in the summer season. Thus<br>slaughtered by Karna, the Pandava troops, struck with fear, fled in all<br>directions, at the very sight of Karna. Loud wails arose there among the<br>Pancalas in that great battle, while they were thus struck with the keen<br>shafts sped from Karna's bow. Struck with fear at the noise, the vast<br>host of the Pandavas, those enemies of Karna, regarded him as the one<br>warrior in that battle. Then that crusher of foes, viz., the son of<br>Radha, once more achieved an exceedingly wonderful feat, inasmuch as all<br>the Pandavas, united together, were unable to even gaze at him. Like a<br>swelling mass of water breaking when it comes in contact with a mountain,<br>the Pandava army broke when it came in contact with Karna. Indeed, O<br>king, the mighty-armed Karna in that battle, burning the vast host of the<br>Pandavas, stood there like a blazing fire without smoke. With great<br>activity that hero, with his shafts, cut off the arms and the heads of<br>his brave foes, O king, and their ears decked with earrings. Swords with<br>hilts of ivory, and standards, and darts, and steeds, and elephants, and<br>cars of diverse kind, O king, and banners, and axles, and yokes, and<br>wheels of many kinds, were cut off in various ways by Karna, observant of<br>a warrior's vow. There, O Bharata, with elephants and steeds slain by<br>Karna, the earth became impassable and miry with flesh and blood. The<br>uneven and even spots also of the field, in consequence of slain horse<br>and foot and broken cars and dead elephants, could no longer be<br>distinguished. The combatants could not distinguish friends from foes in<br>that thick darkness caused by shafts when Karna's (celestial) weapon was<br>displayed. The mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas, O monarch, were<br>completely shrouded with shafts, decked with gold, that were sped from<br>Karna's bow. Those mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas, O king, in that<br>battle, though struggling vigorously, were repeatedly broken by the son<br>of Radha, even as a herd of deer in the forest is routed by an angry<br>lion. Routing the foremost of Pancala car-warriors and (other) foes,<br>Karna of great fame, in that battle, slew the Pandava warriors like a<br>wolf slaying smaller animals. Beholding the Pandava army turn away from<br>battle, the Dhartarashtra bowmen of great might rushed against the<br>retreating host uttering terrible shouts. Then Duryodhana, O monarch,<br>filled with great delight, caused diverse musical instruments to be<br>beaten and blown in all parts of the army. The great bowmen amongst the<br>Pancalas, those foremost of men, though broken, returned heroically to<br>the fight, making death their goal. The son of Radha, however, that bull<br>among men and scorcher of foes, O monarch, in that battle, broke those<br>returned heroes in diverse ways. There, O Bharata twenty car-warriors<br>among the Pancalas and more than a hundred Cedi warriors were slain by<br>Karna with his shafts. Making the terraces of cars and the backs of<br>steeds empty, O Bharata, and slaying the combatants that fought from the<br>necks of elephants, and routing the foot-soldiers, that scorcher of foes,<br>the Suta's son of great bravery, became incapable of being gazed at like<br>the mid-day sun and looked resplendent like the Destroyer himself at the<br>end of the Yuga. Thus, O monarch, that slayer of foes, that mighty<br>bowmen, Karna, having slain foot, horse, car-warriors, and elephants,<br>stood there on his car. Indeed, like the Destroyer himself of great might<br>standing after slaying all creatures, the mighty car-warrior Karna stood<br>alone, having slain the Somakas. The prowess that we then beheld of the<br>Pancalas seemed to be exceedingly wonderful, for, though thus struck by<br>Karna, they refused to fly away from that hero at the head of battle. At<br>that time, the king (Duryodhana), and Duhshasana, and Kripa, the son of<br>Sharadvata, and Ashvatthama, and Kritavarma, and Shakuni also of great<br>might, slaughtered the Pandava warriors in hundreds and thousands. The<br>two sons also of Karna, O monarch, those two brothers of prowess<br>incapable of being baffled, filled with rage, slaughtered the Pandava<br>army in several parts of the field. The battle at that place was dreadful<br>and cruel and the carnage that occurred was very great. Similarly the<br>Pandava heroes, Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi and the (five) sons of<br>Draupadi, filled with rage, slaughtered thy host. Even thus a great<br>destruction took place among the Pandavas everywhere on the field, and<br>even thus thy army also suffered great loss at the hands of the mighty<br>Bhima.'"
