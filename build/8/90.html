                            "Sanjaya said, 'Flying away in consequence of the falling of Arjuna's<br>arrows, the broken divisions of the Kauravas, staying at a distance,<br>continued to gaze at Arjuna's weapon swelling with energy and careering<br>around with the effulgence of lightning. Then Karna, with showers of<br>terrible shafts, baffled that weapon of Arjuna while it was still<br>careering in the welkin and which Arjuna had shot with great vigour in<br>that fierce encounter for the destruction of his foe. Indeed, that weapon<br>(of Partha) which, swelling with energy, had been consuming the Kurus,<br>the Suta's son now crushed with his shafts winged with gold. Bending then<br>his own loud-sounding bow of irrefragable string, Karna shot showers of<br>shafts. The Suta's son destroyed that burning weapon of Arjuna with his<br>own foe-killing weapon of great power which he had obtained from Rama,<br>and which resembled (in efficacy) an Atharvan rite. And he pierced Partha<br>also with numerous keen shafts. The encounter then, O king, that took<br>place between Arjuna and the son of Adhiratha, became a very dreadful<br>one. They continued to strike each other with arrows like two fierce<br>elephants striking each other with their tusks. All the points of the<br>compass then became shrouded with weapons and the very sun became<br>invisible. Indeed, Karna and Partha, with their arrowy downpours, made<br>the welkin one vast expanse of arrows without any space between. All the<br>Kauravas and the Somakas then beheld a wide-spread arrowy net. In that<br>dense darkness caused by arrows, they were unable to see anything else.<br>Those two foremost of men, both accomplished in weapons, as they<br>incessantly aimed and shot innumerable arrows, O king, displayed diverse<br>kinds of beautiful manoeuvres. While they were thus contending with each<br>other in battle, sometimes the Suta's son prevailed over his rival and<br>sometimes the diadem-decked Partha prevailed over his, in prowess and<br>weapons and lightness of hands. Beholding that terrible and awful<br>passage-at-arms between those two heroes each of whom was desirous of<br>availing himself of the other's lapses, all the other warriors on the<br>field of battle became filled with wonder. The beings in the welkin, O<br>king, applauded Karna and Arjuna. Indeed, many of them at a time, filled<br>with joy, cheerfully shouted, sometimes saying, "Excellent, O Karna!" and<br>sometimes saying, "Excellent, O Arjuna!" During the progress of that<br>fierce encounter, while the earth was being pressed deep with the weight<br>of cars and the tread of steeds and elephants, the snake Aswasena, who<br>was hostile to Arjuna, was passing his time in the nether region. Freed<br>from the conflagration at Khandava, O king, he had, from anger,<br>penetrated through the earth (for going to the subterranean region). That<br>brave snake, recollecting the death of his mother and the enmity he on<br>that account harboured against Arjuna, now rose from the lower region.<br>Endued with the power of ascending the skies, he soared up with great<br>speed upon beholding that fight between Karna and Arjuna. Thinking that<br>that was the time for gratifying his animosity towards, as he thought,<br>the wicked-souled Partha, he quickly entered into Karna's quiver, O king,<br>in the form of an arrow. At that time a net of arrows was seen, shedding<br>its bright arrows around. Karna and Partha made the welkin one dense mass<br>of arrows by means of their arrowy downpours. Beholding that wide-spread<br>expanse of arrows, all the Kauravas and the Somakas became filled with<br>fear. In that thick and awful darkness caused by arrows they were unable<br>to see anything else. Then those two tigers among men, those two foremost<br>of all bowmen in the world, those two heroes, fatigued with their<br>exertions in battle, looked at each other. Both of them were then fanned<br>with excellent and waving fans made of young (palm) leaves and sprinkled<br>with fragrant sandal-water by many Apsaras staying in the welkin. And<br>Sakra and Surya, using their hands, gently brushed the faces of those two<br>heroes. When at last Karna found that he could not prevail over Partha<br>and was exceedingly scorched with the shafts of the former, that hero,<br>his limbs very much mangled, set his heart upon that shaft of his which<br>lay singly within a quiver. The Suta's son then fixed on his bow-string<br>that foe-killing, exceedingly keen, snake-mouthed, blazing, and fierce<br>shaft, which had been polished according to rule, and which he had long<br>kept for the sake of Partha's destruction. Stretching his bow-string to<br>his ear, Karna fixed that shaft of fierce energy and blazing splendour,<br>that ever-worshipped weapon which lay within a golden quiver amid sandal<br>dust, and aimed it at Partha. Indeed, he aimed that blazing arrow, born<br>in Airavata's race, for cutting off Phalguna's head in battle. All the<br>points of the compass and the welkin became ablaze and terrible meteors,<br>and thunderbolts fell. When that snake of the form of an arrow was fixed<br>on the bow-string, the Regents of the world, including Sakra, set up loud<br>wails. The Suta's son did not know that the snake Aswasena had entered<br>his arrow by the aid of his Yoga powers. Beholding Vaikartana aim that<br>arrow, the high-souled ruler of the Madras, addressing Karna, said, "This<br>arrow, O Karna, will not succeed in striking off Arjuna's head. Searching<br>carefully, fix another arrow that may succeed in striking off thy enemy's<br>head." Endued with great activity, the Suta's son, with eyes burning in<br>wrath, then said unto the ruler of the Madras, "O Shalya, Karna never<br>aimeth an arrow twice. Persons like us never become crooked warriors."<br>Having said these words, Karna, with great care, let off that shaft which<br>he had worshipped for many long years. Bent upon winning the victory, O<br>king, he quickly said unto his rival, "Thou art slain, O Phalguna!" Sped<br>from Karna's arms, that shaft of awful whizz, resembling fire or the sun<br>in splendour, as it left the bow-string, blazed up in the welkin and<br>seemed to divide it by a line such as is visible on the crown of a woman<br>dividing her tresses. Beholding that shaft blazing in the welkin, the<br>slayer of Kamsa, Madhava, with great speed and the greatest ease, pressed<br>down with his feet that excellent car, causing it to sink about a cubit<br>deep. At this, the steeds, white as the rays of the moon and decked in<br>trappings of gold, bending their knees, laid themselves down on the<br>ground. Indeed, seeing that snake (in the form of an arrow) aimed by<br>Karna, Madhava, that foremost of all persons endued with might, put forth<br>his strength and thus pressed down with his feet that car into the earth,<br>whereat the steeds, (as already said) bending down their knees, laid<br>themselves down upon the earth when the car itself had sank into it. Then<br>loud sounds arose in the welkin in applause of Vasudeva. Many celestial<br>voices were heard, and celestial flowers were showered upon Krishna, and<br>leonine shouts also were uttered. When the car had thus been pressed down<br>into the earth through the exertions of the slayer of Madhu, the<br>excellent ornament of Arjuna's head, celebrated throughout the earth, the<br>welkin, heaven, and the waters, the Suta's son swept off from the crown<br>of his rival, with that arrow, in consequence of the very nature of that<br>snaky weapon and the great care and wrath with which it had been shot.<br>That diadem, endued with the splendour of the sun or the moon or fire or<br>a planet, and adorned with gold and pearls and gems and diamonds, had<br>with great care been made by the puissant Self-born himself for<br>Purandara. Costly as its appearance indicated, it was inspiring terror in<br>the hearts of foes, contributing to the happiness of him that wore it,<br>and shedding a fragrance, that ornament had been given by the chief of<br>the celestials himself with a cheerful heart unto Partha while the latter<br>had proceeded to slaughter the foes of the gods. That diadem was<br>incapable of being crushed by Rudra and the Lord of waters and Kuvera<br>with Pinaka and noose and thunderbolt and the very foremost of shafts. It<br>could not be endured by even the foremost ones among the gods. Vrisha,<br>however, now broke it forcibly with his snake-inspired shaft. Endued with<br>great activity, that wicked-natured snake of fierce form and false vows,<br>falling upon that diadem-decked with gold and gems, swept it away from<br>Arjuna's head. That snake, O king, forcibly tore it away from Partha's<br>head, quickly reducing into fragments that well-made ornament set over<br>with many a gem and blazing with beauty, like the thunderbolt riving a<br>mountain summit decked with lofty and beautiful trees graced with<br>flowers. Crushed by that excellent weapon, possessed of splendour, and<br>blazing with the fire of (the snake's) poison, that beautiful and<br>much-liked diadem of Partha fell down on the earth like the blazing disc<br>of the Sun from the Asta hills. Indeed, that snake forcibly swept away<br>from Arjuna's head that diadem adorned with many gems, like the thunder<br>of Indra felling a beautiful mountain summit adorned with lofty trees<br>bearing budding leaves and flowers. And the earth, welkin, heaven, and<br>the waters, when agitated by a tempest, roar aloud, O Bharata, even such<br>was the roar that arose in all the worlds at that time. Hearing that<br>tremendous noise, people, notwithstanding their efforts to be calm,<br>became extremely agitated and reeled as they stood. Reft of diadem, the<br>dark complexioned and youthful Partha looked beautiful like a blue<br>mountain of lofty summit. Binding then his locks with a white cloth,<br>Arjuna stood perfectly unmoved. With that white gear on his head, he<br>looked like the Udaya hill illumined with the rays of the sun. Thus that<br>she-snake (whom Arjuna had killed at Khandava) of excellent mouth,<br>through her son in the form of an arrow, sped by Surya's son, beholding<br>Arjuna of exceeding energy and might standing with his head at a level<br>with the reins of the steeds, took away his diadem only, that well-made<br>ornament (formerly) owned by Aditi's son and endued with the effulgence<br>of Surya himself. But Arjuna also (as will appear in the sequel) did not<br>return from that battle without causing the snake to succumb to the power<br>of Yama. Sped from Karna's arms, that costly shaft resembling fire or the<br>sun in effulgence, viz., that mighty snake who from before had become the<br>deadly foe of Arjuna, thus crushing the latter's diadem, went away.<br>Having burnt the gold-decked diadem of Arjuna displayed on his head, he<br>desired to come to Arjuna once more with great speed. Asked, however, by<br>Karna (who saw him but knew him not), he said these words, "Thou hadst<br>sped me, O Karna, without having seen me. It was for this that I could<br>not strike off Arjuna's head. Do thou quickly shoot me once again, after<br>seeing me well. I shall then slay thy foe and mine too." Thus addressed<br>in that battle by him, the Suta's son said, "Who are you possessed of<br>such fierce form?" The snake answered, saying, "Know me as one that has<br>been wronged by Partha. My enmity towards him is due to his having slain<br>my mother. If the wielder of the thunderbolt himself were to protect<br>Partha, the latter would still have to go to the domains of the king of<br>the pitris. Do not disregard me. Do my bidding. I will slay thy foe.<br>Shoot me without delay." Hearing those words, Karna said, "Karna, O<br>snake, never desires to have victory in battle today by relying on<br>another's might. Even if I have to slay a hundred Arjunas, I will not, O<br>snake, still shoot the same shaft twice." Once more addressing him in the<br>midst of battle, that best of men, viz., Surya's son, Karna, said, "Aided<br>by the nature of my other snaky weapons, and by resolute effort and<br>wrath, I shall slay Partha. Be thou happy and go elsewhere." Thus<br>addressed, in battle, by Karna, that prince of snakes, unable from rage<br>to bear those words, himself proceeded, O king, for the slaughter of<br>Partha, having assumed the form of an arrow. Of fierce form, the desire<br>he ardently cherished was the destruction of his enemy. Then Krishna,<br>addressing Partha in that encounter, said into him, "Slay that great<br>snake inimical to thee." Thus addressed by the slayer of Madhu, the<br>wielder of Gandiva, that bowman who was always fierce unto foes, enquired<br>of him, saying, "Who is that snake that advanceth of his own accord<br>against me, as if, indeed he advanceth right against the mouth of<br>Garuda?" Krishna replied, "Whilst thou, armed with bow, wert engaged at<br>Khandava in gratifying the god Agni, this snake was then in the sky, his<br>body ensconced within his mother's. Thinking that it was only a single<br>snake that was so staying in the sky, thou killedest the mother.<br>Remembering that act of hostility done by thee, he cometh towards thee<br>today for thy destruction. O resister of foes, behold him coming like a<br>blazing meteor, falling from the firmament!'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Then Jishnu, turning his face in rage, cut off, with<br>six keen shafts, that snake in the welkin as the latter was coursing in a<br>slanting direction. His body thus cut off, he fell down on the earth.<br>After that snake had been cut off by Arjuna, the lord Keshava himself, O<br>king, of massive arms, that foremost of beings, raised up with his arms<br>that car from the earth. At that time, Karna, glancing obliquely at<br>Dhananjaya, pierced that foremost of persons, viz., Krishna, with ten<br>shafts whetted on stone and equipped with peacock feathers. Then<br>Dhananjaya, piercing Karna with a dozen well-shot and keen arrows<br>equipped with heads like the boar's ear, sped a cloth-yard shaft endued<br>with the energy of a snake of virulent poison and shot from his<br>bow-string stretched to his ear. That foremost of shafts, well shot by<br>Arjuna, penetrated through Karna's armour, and as if suspending his life<br>breaths, drank his blood and entered the earth, its wings also having<br>been drenched with gore. Endued with great activity, Vrisha, enraged at<br>the stroke of the shaft, like a snake beaten with stick, shot many mighty<br>shafts, like snakes of virulent poison vomiting venom. And he pierced<br>Janardana with a dozen shafts and Arjuna with nine and ninety. And once<br>more piercing the son of Pandu with a terrible shaft, Karna laughed and<br>uttered a loud roar. The son of Pandu, however, could not endure his<br>enemy's joy. Acquainted with all the vital parts of the human body,<br>Partha, possessed of prowess like that of Indra, pierced those vital<br>limbs with hundreds of arrows even as Indra had struck Vala with great<br>energy. Then Arjuna sped ninety arrows, each resembling the rod of Death<br>at Karna. Deeply pierced with those shafts, Karna trembled like a<br>mountain riven with thunder. The head-gear of Karna, adorned with costly<br>gems and precious diamonds and pure gold, as also his earrings, cut off<br>by Dhananjaya with his winged arrows, fell down on the earth. The costly<br>and bright armour also of the Suta's son that had been forged with great<br>care by many foremost of artists working for a long time, the son of<br>Pandu cut off within a moment in many fragments. After thus divesting him<br>of his armour, Partha then, in rage, pierced Karna with four whetted<br>shafts of great energy. Struck forcibly by his foe, Karna suffered great<br>pain like a diseased person afflicted by bile, phlegm, wind, and fever.<br>Once more Arjuna, with great speed, mangled Karna, piercing his very<br>vitals, with numerous excellent shafts, of great keenness, and sped from<br>his circling bow with much force and speed and care. Deeply struck by<br>Partha with those diverse arrows of keen points and fierce energy, Karna<br>(covered with blood) looked resplendent like a mountain of red chalk with<br>streams of red water running adown its breast. Once more Arjuna pierced<br>Karna in the centre of the chest with many straight-coursing and strong<br>shafts made entirely of iron and equipped with wings of gold and each<br>resembling the fiery rod of the Destroyer, like the son of Agni piercing<br>the Krauncha mountains. Then the Suta's son, casting aside his bow that<br>resembled the very bow of Sakra, as also his quiver, felt great pain, and<br>stood inactive, stupefied, and reeling, his grasp loosened and himself in<br>great anguish. The virtuous Arjuna, observant of the duty of manliness,<br>wished not to slay his enemy while fallen into such distress. The younger<br>brother of Indra then, with great excitement, addressed him, saying,<br>"Why, O son of Pandu, dost thou become so forgetful? They that are truly<br>wise never spare their foes, however weak, even for a moment. He that is<br>learned earneth both merit and fame by slaying foes fallen into distress.<br>Lose no time in precipitately crushing Karna who is always inimical to<br>thee and who is the first of heroes. The Suta's son, when able, will once<br>more advance against thee as before. Slay him, therefore, like Indra<br>slaying the Asura Namuci." Saying, "So be it, O Krishna!" and worshipping<br>Janardana, Arjuna, that foremost of all persons in Kuru's race once more<br>quickly pierced Karna with many excellent arrows like the ruler of<br>heaven, piercing the Asura, Samvara. The diadem-decked Partha, O Bharata,<br>covered Karna and his car and steeds with many calf-toothed arrows, and<br>putting forth all his vigour he shrouded all the points of the compass<br>with shafts equipped with wings of gold. Pierced with those arrows<br>equipped with heads like the calf's tooth, Adhiratha's son of broad chest<br>looked resplendent like an Asoka or Palasa or Salmali decked with its<br>flowery load or a mountain overgrown with a forest of sandal trees.<br>Indeed, with those numerous arrows sticking to his body, Karna, O<br>monarch, in that battle, looked resplendent like the prince of mountains<br>with its top and glens overgrown with trees or decked with flowering<br>Karnikaras. Karna also shooting repeated showers of arrows, looked, with<br>those arrows constituting his rays, like the sun coursing towards the<br>Asta hills, with disc bright with crimson rays. Shafts, however, of keen<br>points, sped from Arjuna's arms, encountering in the welkin the blazing<br>arrows, resembling mighty snakes, sped from the arms of Adhiratha's son,<br>destroyed them all. Recovering his coolness, and shooting many shafts<br>that resembled angry snakes, Karna then pierced Partha with ten shafts<br>and Krishna with half a dozen, each of which looked like an angry snake.<br>Then Dhananjaya desired to shoot a mighty and terrible arrow, made wholly<br>of iron, resembling the poison of snake or fire in energy, and whose<br>whizz resembling the peal of Indra's thunder, and which was inspired with<br>the force of a high (celestial) weapon. At that time, when the hour of<br>Karna's death had come, Kala, approaching invisibly, and alluding to the<br>Brahmana's curse, and desirous of informing Karna that his death was<br>near, told him, "The Earth is devouring thy wheel!" Indeed, O foremost of<br>men, when the hour of Karna's death came, the high brahmastra that the<br>illustrious Bhargava had imparted unto him, escaped from his memory. And<br>the earth also began to devour the left wheel of his car. Then in<br>consequence of the curse of that foremost of Brahmanas, Karna's car began<br>to reel, having sunk deep into the earth and having been transfixed at<br>that spot like a sacred tree with its load of flowers standing upon an<br>elevated platform. When his car began to reel from the curse of the<br>Brahmana, and when the high weapon he had obtained from Rama no longer<br>shone in him through inward light, and when his terrible snake-mouthed<br>shaft also had been cut off by Partha, Karna became filled with<br>melancholy. Unable to endure all those calamities, he waved his arms and<br>began to rail at righteousness saying, "They that are conversant with<br>righteousness always say that righteousness protects those that are<br>righteous. As regards ourselves, we always endeavour, to the best of our<br>ability and knowledge to practise righteousness. That righteousness,<br>however, is destroying us now instead of protecting us that are devoted<br>to it. I, therefore, think that righteousness does not always protect its<br>worshippers." While saying these words, he became exceedingly agitated by<br>the strokes of Arjuna's arrows. His steeds and his driver also were<br>displaced from their usual position. His very vitals having been struck,<br>he became indifferent as to what he did, and repeatedly railed at<br>righteousness in that battle. He then pierced Krishna in the arm with<br>three terrible arrows, and Partha, too, with seven. Then Arjuna sped<br>seven and ten terrible arrows, perfectly straight and of fierce<br>impetuosity, resembling fire in splendour and like unto Indra's thunder<br>in force. Endued with awful impetuosity, those arrows pierced Karna and<br>passing out of his body fell upon the surface of the earth. Trembling at<br>the shock, Karna then displayed his activity to the utmost of his power.<br>Steadying himself by a powerful effort he invoked the brahmastra.<br>Beholding the brahmastra, Arjuna invoked the Aindra weapon with proper<br>mantras. Inspiring gandiva, its string, and his shafts also, with<br>mantras, that scorcher of foes poured showers like Purandara pouring rain<br>in torrents. Those arrows endued with great energy and power, issuing out<br>of Partha's car, were seen to be displayed in the vicinity of Karna's<br>vehicle. The mighty car-warrior Karna baffled all those shafts displayed<br>in his front. Seeing that weapon thus destroyed, the Vrishni hero,<br>addressing Arjuna, said, "Shoot high weapons, O Partha! The son of Radha<br>baffles thy shafts." With proper mantras, Arjuna then fixed the<br>brahmastra on his string, and shrouding all the points of the compass<br>with arrows, Partha struck Karna (with many) arrows. Then Karna, with a<br>number of whetted shafts endued with great energy, cut off the string of<br>Arjuna's bow. Similarly he cut off the second string, and then the third,<br>and then the fourth, and then the fifth. The sixth also was cut off by<br>Vrisha, and then the seventh, then the eighth, then the ninth, then the<br>tenth, and then at last the eleventh. Capable of shooting hundreds upon<br>hundreds of arrows, Karna knew not that Partha had a hundred strings to<br>his bow. Tying another string to his bow and shooting many arrows, the<br>son of Pandu covered Karna with shafts that resembled snakes of blazing<br>mouths. So quickly did Arjuna replace each broken string that Karna could<br>not mark when it was broken and when replaced. The feat seemed to him to<br>be exceedingly wonderful. The son of Radha baffled with his own weapons<br>those of Savyasaci. Displaying also his own prowess, he seemed to get the<br>better of Dhananjaya at that time. Then Krishna, beholding Arjuna<br>afflicted with the weapons of Karna, said these words unto Partha:<br>"Approaching Karna, strike him with superior weapons." Then Dhananjaya,<br>filled with rage, inspiring with mantras another celestial weapons that<br>looked like fire and that resembled the poison of the snake and that was<br>as hard as the essence of adamant, and uniting the Raudra weapon with it,<br>became desirous of shooting it at his foe. At that time, O king, the<br>earth swallowed up one of wheels of Karna's car. Quickly alighting then<br>from his vehicle, he seized his sunken wheel with his two arms and<br>endeavoured to lift it up with a great effort. Drawn up with force by<br>Karna, the earth, which had swallowed up his wheel, rose up to a height<br>of four fingers' breadth, with her seven islands and her hills and waters<br>and forests. Seeing his wheel swallowed, the son of Radha shed tears from<br>wrath, and beholding Arjuna, filled with rage he said these words, "O<br>Partha, O Partha, wait for a moment, that is, till I lift this sunken<br>wheel. Beholding, O Partha, the left wheel of my car swallowed through<br>accident by the earth, abandon (instead of cherishing) this purpose (of<br>striking and slaying me) that is capable of being harboured by only a<br>coward. Brave warriors that are observant of the practices of the<br>righteous, never shoot their weapons at persons with dishevelled hair, or<br>at those that have turned their faces from battle, or at a Brahmana, or<br>at him who joins his palms, or at him who yields himself up or beggeth<br>for quarter or at one who has put up his weapon, or at one whose arrows<br>are exhausted, or at one whose armour is displaced, or at one whose<br>weapon has fallen off or been broken! Thou art the bravest of men in the<br>world. Thou art also of righteous behaviour, O son of Pandu! Thou art<br>well-acquainted with the rules of battle. For these reasons, excuse me<br>for a moment, that is, till I extricate my wheel, O Dhananjaya, from the<br>earth. Thyself staying on thy car and myself standing weak and languid on<br>the earth, it behoveth thee not to slay me now. Neither Vasudeva, nor<br>thou, O son of Pandu, inspirest me with the slightest fear. Thou art born<br>in the Kshatriya order. Thou art the perpetuator of a high race.<br>Recollecting the teachings of righteousness, excuse me for a moment, O<br>son of Pandu!"'"
