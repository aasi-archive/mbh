                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then the mighty and heroic bowman Karna began to smite<br>the Pandava army in that battle, with his straight shafts. Similarly,<br>those great car-warriors, viz., the Pandavas, O king, filled with wrath,<br>began to smite the army of thy son in the very sight of Karna. Karna<br>also, O king, in that battle slew the Pandava army with his cloth-yard<br>shafts bright as the rays of the Sun and polished by the hands of the<br>smith. There, O Bharata, the elephants, struck by Karna with his shafts,<br>uttered loud cries, lost strength, became faint, and wandered on all<br>sides. While the army was being thus destroyed by the Suta's son, Nakula<br>rushed with speed against that mighty car-warrior. And Bhimasena rushed<br>against Drona's son who was engaged in the accomplishment of the most<br>difficult feats. Satyaki checked the Kaikaya princes Vinda and Anuvinda.<br>King Citrasena rushed against the advancing Srutakarman; and Prativindhya<br>against Citra owning a beautiful standard and a beautiful bow. Duryodhana<br>rushed against king Yudhishthira the son of Dharma; while Dhananjaya<br>rushed against the angry throngs of the samsaptakas. In that slaughter of<br>great heroes, Dhrishtadyumna proceeded against Kripa. The invincible<br>Shikhandi closed with Kritavarma. Srutakirti encountered Shalya, and<br>Madri's son, the valiant Sahadeva, O king, encountered thy son<br>Duhshasana. The two Kaikaya princes, in that battle, shrouded Satyaki<br>with a shower of blazing arrows, and the latter also, O Bharata, shrouded<br>the two Kaikaya brothers. Those two heroic brothers deeply struck Satyaki<br>in the chest like two elephants striking with their tusks a hostile<br>compeer in the forest. Indeed, O king, those two brothers, in that<br>battle, their own vitals pierced with shafts, pierced Satyaki of true<br>deeds with their shafts. Satyaki, however, O great king, covering all the<br>points of the compass with a shower of arrows and smiling the while,<br>checked the two brothers, O Bharata. Checked by those showers of arrows<br>shot by the grandson of Sini, the two brothers speedily shrouded the car<br>of Sini's grandson with their shafts. Cutting off their beautiful bows,<br>Saurin of great fame checked them both with his keen arrows in that<br>battle. Taking up two other beautiful bows, and a number of powerful<br>shafts, the two began to cover Satyaki and career with great activity and<br>skill. Shot by the two brothers, those mighty shafts equipped with the<br>feathers of the Kanka and the peacock and decked with gold, began to<br>fall, illumining all the points of the compass. In that dreadful battle<br>between them, O king, the arrows they shot caused a darkness there. Those<br>mighty car-warriors then cut off each other's bows. Then the invincible<br>Satwata, O king, filled with rage, took up another bow in that battle,<br>and stringing it, cut off Anuvinda's head with a keen razor-headed shaft.<br>Decked with earrings, that large head, O king, fell like the head of<br>Samvara slain in the great battle (of old). And it reached the Earth in<br>no time, filling all the Kaikayas with grief. Beholding that brave<br>warrior slain, his brother, the mighty car-warrior Vinda, stringing<br>another bow began to resist the grandson of Sini from every side.<br>Piercing with sixty arrows equipped with wings of gold and whetted on<br>stone, he uttered a loud shout and said, "Wait, Wait!" Then that mighty<br>car-warrior of the Kaikayas speedily struck Satyaki with many thousands<br>of shafts in his arms and chest. All his limbs wounded with arrows,<br>Satyaki, of prowess incapable of being baffled, looked resplendent in<br>that battle, O king, like a flowering Kinsuka. Pierced by the high-souled<br>Kaikaya in that encounter, Satyaki, with the greatest ease, pierced the<br>Kaikaya (in return) with five and twenty arrows. Then those two foremost<br>of car-warriors, having each cut off the other's handsome bow in that<br>encounter, and having each quickly slain the other's driver and steeds<br>approached each other on foot for a fight with swords. Both endued with<br>massive arms, they looked resplendent on that extensive arena, each<br>having taken up a shield decked with a hundred moons, and each armed with<br>an excellent sword, like Jambha and Sakra, both endued with great might,<br>in the battle between the gods and the Asuras (of old). Both of them, in<br>that great battle, then began to career in circles. And then they<br>speedily encountered each other in battle, each approaching the other<br>near. And each of them made great efforts for the destruction of the<br>other. Then Satwata cut in twain the shield of Kaikeya. The latter also,<br>O king, cut in twain the shield of Satyaki. Having cut off his<br>antagonist's shield covered with centuries of stars, Kaikeya began to<br>career in circles, advancing and receding (at times). Then the grandson<br>of Sini, endued with great activity, cut off by a sidestroke the prince<br>of the Kaikeyas thus careering in that great arena armed with excellent<br>sword. Cased in armour that great bowman, viz., the Kaikeya prince, O<br>king, thus cut off in twain in that great battle, fell down like a hill<br>riven with thunder. Having slain him in battle that foremost of<br>car-warriors that scorcher of foes, viz., the brave grandson of Sini<br>quickly got upon the car of Yudhamanyu. Afterwards riding upon another<br>car duly equipped (with everything), Satyaki began to slay with his<br>shafts the large force of the Kaikeyas. The vast army of the Kaikeyas,<br>thus slaughtered in battle, leaving that foe of theirs fled away on all<br>sides.'"
