                            "Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile Krishna, pointing out king Yudhishthira the<br>just, unto Kunti's son Partha, addressed him in these words: "Yonder, O<br>son of Pandu, your brother (Yudhishthira) is being pursued by many mighty<br>and great bowmen amongst the Dhartarashtras, all inspired with the desire<br>of slaughtering him. The mighty Pancalas, difficult of defeat in battle,<br>are proceeding after the high-souled Yudhishthira from desire of rescuing<br>him. Yonder, Duryodhana, O Partha, the king of the whole world, clad in<br>mail and accompanied by a large car force, is pursuing the Pandava king.<br>Impelled by the desire of slaughtering his rival, the mighty Duryodhana,<br>O tiger among men, is pursuing him, accompanied by his brothers, the<br>touch of whose weapons is as fatal as that of poisonous snakes and who<br>are all conversant with every mode of warfare. Those Dhartarashtra<br>elephants and horses and car-warriors and foot-soldiers are advancing to<br>seize Yudhishthira like poor men after a precious gem. Behold, checked by<br>Satyaki and Bhima, they have again been stupefied, like the Daityas, that<br>desired to take away the Amrita, made motionless by Sakra and Agni. The<br>mighty car-warriors (of the Kuru army), however, in consequence of the<br>vastness of their numbers, are again proceeding towards Yudhishthira like<br>a vast quantity of water in the season of rains rushing towards the<br>ocean. Those mighty bowmen are uttering leonine roars, blowing their<br>conchs, and shaking their bows. I regard Kunti's son Yudhishthira, thus<br>brought under the influence of Duryodhana, to be already within the jaws<br>of Death or already poured as a libation on the sacrificial fire. The<br>army of Dhritarashtra's son, O Pandava, is arrayed and equipped duly.<br>Sakra himself, coming within the range of its arrows, can scarcely<br>escape. Who will in battle bear the impetuosity of the heroic Duryodhana<br>who shoots showers of arrows with the greatest celerity and who, when<br>angry, resembles the Destroyer himself? The force of the heroic<br>Duryodhana's shafts, or Drona's son's or Kripa's or Karna's would break<br>down the very mountains. That scorcher of foes, viz., king Yudhishthira,<br>was once compelled by Karna to turn his back upon the field. The son of<br>Radha is endued with great might and great lightness of hand. Possessed<br>of great skill, he is accomplished in battle. He is competent to afflict<br>the eldest son of Pandu in fight, specially when he is united with the<br>mighty and brave son of Dhritarashtra. Of rigid vows, when the son of<br>Pritha (Yudhishthira) had been engaged in battle with all those warriors,<br>other great car-warriors had struck him and contributed to his defeat.<br>The king, O best of the Bharatas, is exceedingly emaciated in consequence<br>of his fasts. He is endued with Brahma-force, but the puissant one is not<br>endued with much of Kshatriya-might. Assailed, however, by Karna, the<br>royal son of Pandu, Yudhishthira, that scorcher of foes, hath been placed<br>in a situation of great peril. I think, O Partha, that king Yudhishthira<br>has fallen. Indeed, since that chastiser of foes, the wrathful Bhimasena,<br>coolly heareth the leonine roars of the frequently shouting<br>Dhartarashtra's longing for victory and blowing their conchs, I think, O<br>bull among men, that Pandu's son Yudhishthira is dead. Yonder Karna urges<br>forward the mighty car-warriors of the Dhartarashtras towards the son of<br>Pritha with the weapons called Sthunakarna, Indrasjaha and Pasupata, and<br>with clubs and other weapons. The king, O Bharata, must be deeply<br>afflicted and exceedingly weakened, because the Pancalas and the<br>Pandavas, those foremost of all wielders of weapons, are seen to proceed<br>with great speed towards him at a time when speed is of the highest<br>moment like strong men rushing to the rescue of a person sinking in a<br>bottomless sea. The king's standard is no longer visible. It has probably<br>been struck down by Karna with his shafts. In the very sight of the<br>twins, O Partha, and of Satyaki and Shikhandi, and Dhrishtadyumna and<br>Bhima and Satanika, O lord, as also of all the Pancalas and the Cedis, O<br>Bharata, yonder Karna is destroying the Pandava division with his arrows,<br>like an elephant destroying an assemblage of lotuses. There, those<br>car-warriors of thy army, O son of Pandu, are flying away. See, see, O<br>Partha, how those great warriors are retreating. Those elephants, O<br>Bharata, assailed by Karna in battle, are flying away in all directions,<br>uttering cries of pain. There those crowds of car-warriors, routed in<br>battle, O Partha, by Karna, that crusher of foes, are flying away in all<br>directions. Behold, O Partha, that foremost of standards, of the Suta's<br>son, on his car, bearing the device of the elephant's rope, is seen to<br>move all over the field. There, the son of Radha is now rushing against<br>Bhimasena, scattering hundreds of shafts as he proceeds and slaughtering<br>thy army therewith. There, those mighty car-warriors of the Pancalas are<br>being routed (by Karna) even as the Daityas had been routed by Sakra in<br>dreadful battle. There, Karna, having vanquished the Pancalas, the<br>Pandus, and the Srinjayas, is casting his eyes on all sides, I think, for<br>seeking thee. Behold, O Partha, Karna, as he beautifully draws his<br>foremost of bows, looketh exceedingly beautiful even as Sakra in the<br>midst of the celestials, after vanquishing his foes. There the Kauravas,<br>beholding the prowess of Karna, are roaring and inspiring the Pandus and<br>the Srinjayas with fear on every side. There, Karna himself, terrifying<br>the Pandus with his whole soul, in dreadful battle, is addressing all the<br>troops, O giver of honours, saying, 'Blessed be ye, advance, ye Kauravas<br>and rush with such speed that no Srinjaya may, in this battle escape with<br>life. United together, do this all of you. As regards ourselves, we will<br>follow behind you.' Saying these words, he is advancing behind (his<br>troops), scattering his shafts. Behold Karna, adorned with his white<br>umbrella in this battle and looking like the Udaya hills adorned by the<br>moon. With his beautiful umbrella of a hundred ribs, resembling the moon<br>in full, held over his head, O Bharata, in this battle, Karna, O prince,<br>is casting his glances after thee. Without doubt, he will, in this<br>battle, come hither, with great speed. Behold him, O mighty-armed one, as<br>he shaketh his formidable bow and shooteth, in this dreadful battle, his<br>shafts resembling snakes of virulent poison. There, the son of Radha<br>turneth towards this direction, beholding thy banner bearing the ape, and<br>desiring, O Partha, an encounter with thee, O scorcher of foes. Indeed,<br>he cometh for his own destruction, even like an insect into the mouth of<br>a lamp. Wrathful and brave, he is ever engaged in the good of<br>Dhritarashtra's son. Of wicked understanding, he is always unable to put<br>up with thee. Beholding Karna alone and unsupported, Dhritarashtra's son,<br>O Bharata, turneth towards him with great resolution, accompanied by his<br>car-force, for protecting him. Let that wicked-souled one, along with all<br>those allies of his, be slain by thee, putting forth thy vigour, from<br>desire of winning fame, kingdom and happiness. Both of you are endued<br>with great strength. Both of you are possessed of great celebrity. When<br>encountering each other in battle, O Partha, like a celestial and a<br>Danava in the great battle between the gods and the Asuras, let all the<br>Kauravas behold thy prowess. Beholding thee filled with great rage and<br>Karna also excited to fury, O bull of Bharata's race, Duryodhana in wrath<br>will not be able to do anything. Remembering thyself to be of purified<br>soul, O bull of Bharata's race, and remembering also that the son of<br>Radha harboureth a great animosity for the virtuous Yudhishthira, achieve<br>that, O son of Kunti, which should now be achieved. Righteously setting<br>thy heart on battle, advance against that leader of car-warriors. There,<br>five hundred foremost of car-warriors, O thou best of car-warriors, that<br>are endued with great might and fierce energy, and 5,000 elephants, and<br>twice as many horses, and innumerable foot-soldiers, all united together,<br>O son of Kunti, and protecting one another, O hero, are advancing against<br>thee. Show thyself, of thy own will, unto that great bowman, viz., the<br>Suta's son. Advance, O bull of Bharata's race, towards him with great<br>speed. There, Karna, filled with great wrath is rushing against the<br>Pancalas. I see his standard approaching towards the car of<br>Dhrishtadyumna. I think he will exterminate the Pancalas. I will tell<br>thee, O bull of Bharata's race, some good news, O Partha. King<br>Yudhishthira the just is living. There, the mighty-armed Bhima, having<br>returned, is stationed at the head of the army, supported by the<br>Srinjayas and by Satyaki, O Bharata. There, the Kauravas are being<br>slaughtered with keen shafts by Bhimasena, O son of Kunti, and the<br>high-souled Pancalas. The troops of Dhritarashtra's son, with their faces<br>turned from the field, and with blood streaming down from their wounds,<br>are speedily flying away from battle, struck by Bhima with his shafts.<br>Bathed in blood, the Bharata army, O chief of Bharata's race, presents an<br>exceedingly cheerless aspect like that of the Earth when divested of<br>crops. Behold, O son of Kunti, Bhimasena, that foremost of combatants,<br>filled with rage like a snake of virulent poison, and engaged in routing<br>the (Kaurava) host. Yellow and red and black and white banners, adorned<br>with stars and moons and suns as also many umbrellas, O Arjuna, lie<br>scattered about. Made of gold or silver or brass and other metals,<br>standards are lying about, and elephants and steeds also, scattered all<br>over the field. There, those car-warriors are falling from their cars,<br>deprived of life by the unreturning Pancalas with shafts of diverse<br>kinds. There the Pancalas of great speed, O Dhananjaya, are rushing<br>against the riderless Dhartarashtra elephants and steeds and cars.<br>Reckless of their very lives, O chastiser of foes, those warriors,<br>difficult of defeat in battle aided by the might of Bhimasena are<br>crushing, O tiger among men, the hostile force. There, the Pancalas are<br>uttering loud roars and blowing their conchs as they are rushing against<br>their foes and crushing them with their shafts in battle. Behold their<br>great energy and power. Through sheer valour, the Pancalas are<br>slaughtering the Dhartarashtras like angry lions slaying elephants.<br>Unarmed they are snatching the weapons of their armed foes and with those<br>weapons thus snatched, they are slaying their foes that are effectual<br>smiters, and uttering loud roars. The heads and arms of their foes are<br>being struck off and felled on the field. The Pancala cars and elephants<br>and horses are all worthy of the highest praise. Like swans of great<br>speed leaving the Manasa lake and rushing into the Ganga, the Pancalas<br>are rushing against the Kauravas, and every part of the vast<br>Dhartarashtra force is assailed by them. Like bulls resisting bulls, the<br>heroic Kripa and Karna and other leaders are putting forth all their<br>valour for resisting the Pancalas. The Pancala heroes headed by<br>Dhrishtadyumna are slaying thousands of their foes, viz., the great<br>car-warriors of the Dhartarashtra army already sinking in the ocean of<br>Bhima's weapons. Beholding the Pancalas overwhelmed by their foes, the<br>fearless son of the Wind-god, assailing the hostile force, is shooting<br>his shafts and uttering loud roars. The greater portion of the vast<br>Dhartarashtra army has become exceedingly frightened. Behold those<br>elephants, pierced by Bhima with his cloth-yard shafts, are falling down<br>like mountain summits riven by the thunderbolt of Indra. There, those<br>huge elephants, deeply pierced with the straight shafts of Bhimasena are<br>flying away, crushing their own ranks. Dost thou not recognise the<br>unbearable leonine shouts, O Arjuna, of the terribly-roaring Bhimasena<br>inspired with desire of victory in battle? There, the prince of the<br>Nishadas, filled with rage, is coming against the son of Pandu, on his<br>foremost of elephants, from desire of slaying him with his lances, even<br>like Destroyer himself armed with his bludgeon. Struck by Bhima with ten<br>keen cloth-yard shafts endued with the splendour of the fire or the Sun,<br>the two arms of the roaring prince, with lances in grasp, are lopped off.<br>Staying the prince, Bhima proceedeth against other elephants looking like<br>masses of blue clouds and ridden by riders guiding them with skill.<br>Behold those riders striking Vrikodara with darts and lances in<br>profusion. Slaying with his keen shafts those elephants, seven at a time,<br>their triumphal standards also, O Partha, are cut down by thy elder<br>brother. As regards those other elephants, each of them is being slain<br>with ten shafts by him. The shouts of the Dhartarashtras are no longer<br>heard, now that Bhima, O bull of Bharata's race, who is equal to<br>Purandara himself, is engaged in battle. Full three akshauhinis of<br>Duryodhana's soldiers had been assembled together (in front of Bhima).<br>They have all been checked by that lion among men, Bhimasena, in wrath.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Behold that feat, difficult of accomplishment,<br>achieved by Bhimasena. Arjuna, with his keen shafts, destroyed the<br>remnant of his foes. The mighty samsaptakas, O lord, slaughtered in<br>battle and routed (by Arjuna), fled away in all directions, overcome with<br>fear. Many amongst them (that fell) became the guests of Shakra and<br>attained to great happiness. As regards Partha, that tiger among men, he<br>continued, with his straight shafts, to slaughter the Dhartarashtra host<br>consisting of four kinds of forces.'"
