                            "Sanjaya said, 'Piercing through the Pandava host, Karna, surrounded by<br>thousands of cars and elephants and steeds and foot-soldiers, rushed<br>towards king Yudhishthira the just. Cutting off with hundreds of fierce<br>shafts the thousands of weapons sped at him by his foes, Vrisha<br>fearlessly pierced through that host. Indeed, the Suta's son cut off the<br>heads, the arms and the thighs of his enemies, who, deprived of life,<br>fell down on the Earth. Others, finding their divisions broken, fled<br>away. The Dravida, the Andhaka, and the Nishada foot-soldiers, urged on<br>by Satyaki, once more rushed towards Karna in that battle, from desire of<br>slaying him. Deprived of arms and head-gears, and slain by Karna with his<br>shafts, they fell down simultaneously on the Earth, like a forest of Sala<br>tree cut down (with the axe). Thus hundreds, thousands and ten thousands<br>of combatants, deprived of life and filling the whole welkin with their<br>fame, fell down with their bodies on the Earth. The Pandus and the<br>Pancalas obstructed Karna, otherwise called Vaikartana, who careered<br>wrathfully in battle like the Destroyer himself, even as people seek to<br>obstruct a disease with incantations and drugs. Crushing all those<br>assailants Karna once more rushed towards Yudhishthira, like an<br>irresistible disease unchecked by incantations and drugs and<br>(propitiatory) rites. At last checked by the Pandus, the Pancalas, and<br>the Kekayas, all of whom were desirous of rescuing the king, Karna could<br>not succeed in passing them over, like Death that is unable to vanquish<br>persons conversant with Brahma. Then Yudhishthira, with eyes red in<br>wrath, addressed Karna, that slayer of hostile heroes, who was held in<br>check at a little distance from him, and said these words "O Karna, O<br>Karna, O thou of vain sight, O son of a Suta, listen to my words. Thou<br>always challengest the active Phalguna in battle. Obedient to the<br>counsels of Dhritarashtra's son, thou always seekest to oppose us.<br>Mustering thy great prowess, show thou today all thy might, all thy<br>energy, and all the hatred thou bearest towards the sons of Pandu. Today<br>in dreadful encounter, I will purge thee of thy desire for battle."<br>Having said these words, the son of Pandu, O king, pierced Karna with ten<br>shafts made entirely of iron and equipped with wings of gold. That<br>chastiser of foes, and great bowman, viz., the Suta's son, O Bharata,<br>pierced Yudhishthira, with the greatest care, in return, with ten arrows<br>equipped with heads like the calf's tooth. Thus pierced by the Suta's son<br>in contempt, O sire, the mighty-armed Yudhishthira, blazed up with wrath<br>like a fire upon receiving butter. Bending his formidable bow decked with<br>gold, the son of Pandu placed on his bow-string a whetted arrow capable<br>of piercing the very hills. Drawing the bow to its fullest stretch, the<br>king quickly sped that arrow, fatal as the rod of the Destroyer, from<br>desire of slaying the Suta's son. Sped by the king endued with great<br>might, that arrow whose whizz resembled the noise of the thunder,<br>suddenly pierced Karna, that mighty car-warrior, on his left side. Deeply<br>afflicted by the violence of that stroke, the mighty-armed Karna with<br>weakened limbs, fell into a swoon on his car, his bow dropping from his<br>hand. Beholding Karna in that plight, the vast Dhartarashtra host uttered<br>cries of "Oh" and "Alas," and the faces of all the combatants became<br>colourless. Beholding the prowess of their king, on the other hand, O<br>monarch, amongst the Pandavas, leonine roars and shouts and confused<br>cries of joy arose. The son of Radha, however, of cruel prowess,<br>recovering his senses soon enough, set his heart on the destruction of<br>Yudhishthira. Drawing his formidable bow called Vijaya that was decked<br>with gold, the Suta's son of immeasurable soul began to resist the son of<br>Pandu with his sharp shafts. With a couple of razor-headed arrows he slew<br>in that encounter Candradeva and Dandadhara, the two Pancala princes,<br>that protected the two car wheels of the high-souled Yudhishthira. Each<br>of those heroes, standing by the side of Yudhishthira's car, looked<br>resplendent like the constellation Punarvasu by the side of the moon.<br>Yudhishthira, however, once more pierced Karna with thirty arrows. And he<br>struck Sushena and Satyasena, each with three arrows. And he pierced<br>everyone of the protectors of Karna with three straight arrows. The son<br>of Adhiratha then, laughing and shaking his bow inflicted a cutting wound<br>on the king's body with a broad-headed arrow, and again pierced him with<br>sixty arrows and then uttered a loud shout. Then many foremost heroes<br>amongst the Pandavas, desirous of rescuing the king, rushed in wrath<br>towards Karna and began to grind him with their arrows. Satyaki and<br>Chekitana and Yuyutsu and Shikhandi and the sons of Draupadi and the<br>Prabhadrakas, and the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva) and Bhimasena and<br>Shishupala and the Karushas, Matsyas, the Suras, the Kaikayas, the Kasis<br>and the Kosalas, all these brave heroes, endued with great activity,<br>assailed Vasusena. The Pancala prince Janamejaya then pierced Karna with<br>many arrows. The Pandava heroes, armed with diverse kinds of arrows and<br>diverse weapons and accompanied by cars and elephants and steeds, rushing<br>towards Karna, encompassed him on all sides, from desire of slaying him.<br>Thus assailed on all sides by the foremost of Pandava warriors, Karna<br>invoked into existence the brahmastra and filled all the points of the<br>compass with arrows. The heroic Karna then, like unto a blazing fire<br>having shafts for its scorching flame, careered in battle, burning that<br>forest of Pandavas troops. The high-souled Karna, that great bowman,<br>aiming some mighty weapons, and laughing the while, cut off the bow of<br>that foremost of men, Yudhishthira. Then aiming ninety straight arrows<br>within the twinkling of an eye, Karna cut off, with those sharp shafts,<br>the armour of his antagonist. That armour, decked with gold and set with<br>gems, looked beautiful, as it fell down, like a wind-tossed cloud<br>penetrated by the rays of the Sun. Indeed, that armour, adorned with<br>costly brilliants, fallen off from the body of that foremost of men,<br>looked beautiful like the firmament in the night, bespangled with stars.<br>His armour cut off with those arrows, the son of Pritha, covered with<br>blood, wrathfully hurled at the son of Adhiratha a dart made wholly of<br>iron. Karna, however, cut (into pieces) that blazing dart, as it coursed<br>through the welkin, with seven shafts. That dart, thus cut off with those<br>shafts of great bowman, fell down on the Earth. Then Yudhishthira,<br>striking Karna with four lances in his two arms and forehead and chest,<br>repeatedly uttered loud shouts. Thereupon blood spouted forth from the<br>wounds of Karna, and the latter, filled with rage and breathing like a<br>snake, cut off his antagonist's standard and pierced the Pandava himself<br>with three broad-headed arrows. And he also cut off the couple of quivers<br>(that his foe had) and the car (he rode) into minute fragments. Thereupon<br>the king, riding on another car unto which were yoked those steeds, white<br>as ivory and having black hair on their tails, that used to bear him (to<br>battle), turned his face and began to fly. Thus did Yudhishthira began to<br>retreat. His Parshni driver had been slain. He became exceedingly<br>cheerless and unable to stay before Karna. The son of Radha then,<br>pursuing Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu, cleansed himself by touching him<br>in the shoulder with his own fair hand (the palm of which was) graced<br>with the auspicious signs of the thunderbolt, the umbrella, the hook, the<br>fish, the tortoise, and the conchshell, and desired to seize him by<br>force. He then remembered the words of Kunti. Then Shalya addressed him,<br>and said, "Do not, O Karna, seize this best of kings. As soon as thou<br>seizest him, he will reduce both thee and me to ashes." Then Karna, O<br>king, laughing in mockery, addressed the son of Pandu and thus spoke unto<br>him disparagingly. "How, indeed, born though thou art in a noble race,<br>and observant though thou art of Kshatriya duties, wouldst thou leave the<br>battle in fear, desiring to save thy life? I think that thou art not<br>well-acquainted with the duties of Kshatriyas. Endued with Brahma-force,<br>thou art indeed devoted to the study of the Vedas and the performance of<br>sacrificial rites. Do not, O son of Kunti, fight again, and do not again<br>approach brave warriors. Do not use harsh language towards heroes and do<br>not come to great battles. Thou mayst use such words, O sire, towards<br>others, but thou shouldst never address persons like us in that way. By<br>using such words towards persons like us, thou wouldst in battle meet<br>with this and other kinds of behaviour. Go back to thy quarters, O son of<br>Kunti, or thither where those two, viz., Keshava and Arjuna, are. Indeed,<br>O king, Karna will never slay one like thee." Having said these words<br>unto the son of Pritha, the mighty Karna, setting Yudhishthira free,<br>began to slaughter the Pandava host like the wielder of the thunderbolt<br>slaughtering the Asura host. That ruler of men, (viz., Yudhishthira,)<br>then, O king, quickly fled away. Beholding the king flying away, the<br>Cedis, the Pandavas, the Pancalas, and the mighty car-warrior Satyaki,<br>all followed that monarch of unfading glory. And the sons of Draupadi,<br>and the Suras, and the twin sons of Madri by Pandu, also followed the<br>king. Beholding the division of Yudhishthira retreating, the heroic Karna<br>became highly glad with all the Kurus and began to pursue the retreating<br>force. The din of battle-drums and conchs and cymbals and bows, and<br>leonine shouts, arose from among the Dhartarashtra troops. Meanwhile<br>Yudhishthira, O thou of Kuru's race, quickly riding on the car of<br>Srutakirti, began to behold the prowess of Karna. Then king Yudhishthira,<br>the just, seeing his troops fast slaughtered, became filled with rage,<br>and addressing his warriors, commanded them, saying, "Slay these enemies.<br>Why are ye inactive?" Then the mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas,<br>headed by Bhimasena, thus commanded by the king, all rushed against thy<br>sons. The shouts then, O Bharata, of the warriors (of both hosts), and<br>the noise made by cars and elephants and steeds and foot-soldiers, and<br>the clash of weapons, became tremendous. "Exert," "Strike," "Face the<br>foe," were the words that the combatants addressed to one another as they<br>began to slay one another in that dreadful battle. And in consequence of<br>the showers of shafts shot by them a shadow as that of the clouds seemed<br>to spread over the field. And in consequence of those rulers of men,<br>covered with arrows, striking one another, they became divested of<br>banners and standards and umbrellas and steeds and drivers and weapons in<br>that battle. Indeed, those lords of Earth, deprived of life and limbs,<br>fell down on the Earth. Looking like the mountain-summits in consequence<br>of their uneven backs, huge elephants with their riders, deprived of<br>life, fell down like mountains riven by thunder. Thousands of steeds,<br>with their armour, equipments, and adornments all torn and broken and<br>displaced, fell down, along with their heroic riders, deprived of life.<br>Car-warriors with weapons loosened from their grasp, and deprived by<br>(hostile) car-warriors of cars and life, and large bands of<br>foot-soldiers, slain by hostile heroes in that dreadful clash, fell down<br>in thousands. The Earth became covered with the heads of heroic<br>combatants intoxicated with battle, heads that were adorned with large<br>and expansive eyes of coppery hue and faces as beautiful as the lotus or<br>the moon. And people heard noises as loud in the sky as on the surface of<br>the Earth, in consequence of the sound of music and song proceeding from<br>large bands of Apsaras on their celestial cars, with which those bands of<br>heavenly choristers continually greeted the newly-arrived heroes slain in<br>hundreds and thousands by brave enemies on Earth, and with which, placing<br>them on celestial cars, they repaired on those vehicles (towards the<br>region of Indra). Witnessing with their own eyes those wonderful sights,<br>and actuated by the desire of going to heaven, heroes with cheerful<br>hearts speedily slew one another. Car-warriors fought beautifully with<br>car-warriors in that battle, and foot-soldiers with foot-soldiers, and<br>elephants with elephants, and steeds with steeds. Indeed, when that<br>battle, destructive of elephants and steeds and men, raged in this way,<br>the field became covered with the dust raised by the troops. Then enemies<br>slew enemies and friends slew friends. The combatants dragged one another<br>by their locks, bit one another with their teeth, tore one another with<br>their nails, and struck one another with clenched fists, and fought one<br>another with bare arms in that fierce battle destructive of both life and<br>sins. Indeed, as that battle, fraught with carnage of elephants and<br>steeds and men, raged on so fiercely, a river of blood ran from the<br>bodies of (slain) human beings and steeds and elephants. And that current<br>carried away a large number of dead bodies of elephants and steeds and<br>men. Indeed, in that vast host teeming with men, steeds, and elephants,<br>that river formed by the blood of men and steeds and elephants and<br>horsemen and elephant-men, became miry with flesh and exceedingly<br>terrible. And on that current, inspiring the timid with terror, floated<br>the bodies of men and steeds and elephants. Impelled by the desire of<br>victory, some combatants forded it and some remained on the other side.<br>And some plunged into its depths, and some sank in it and some rose above<br>its surface as they swam through it. Smeared all over with blood, their<br>armour and weapons and robes&#8212;all became bloody. Some bathed in it and<br>some drank the liquid and some became strengthless, O bull of Bharata's<br>race. Cars and steeds, and men and elephants and weapons and ornaments,<br>and robes and armour, and combatants that were slain or about to be<br>slain, and the Earth, the welkin, the firmament, and all the points of<br>the compass, became red. With the odour, the touch, the taste, and the<br>exceedingly red sight of that blood and its rushing sound, almost all the<br>combatants, O Bharata, became very cheerless. The Pandava heroes then,<br>headed by Bhimasena and Satyaki, once more rushed impetuously against<br>that army already beaten. Beholding the impetuosity of that rush of the<br>Pandava heroes to be irresistible, the vast force of thy sons, O king,<br>turned its back on the field. Indeed, that host of thine, teeming with<br>cars and steeds and elephants and men no longer in compact array, with<br>armour and coats of mail displaced and weapons and bows loosened from<br>their grasp, fled away in all directions, whilst being agitated by the<br>enemy, even like a herd of elephants in the forest afflicted by lions.'"
