                            "Sanjaya said, 'Endued with the greatest activity, Drona's son, O king,<br>displaying the lightness of his arms, pierced Bhima with an arrow. Aiming<br>at all his vital points&#8212;for he had a knowledge of all the vital points<br>of the body&#8212;the quick-handed Ashvatthama again struck him with ninety<br>shafts. Pierced all over with keen arrows by the son of Drona, Bhimasena<br>looked resplendent in that battle like the Sun himself with his rays. The<br>son of Pandu then, covering the son of Drona with a 1,000 well-directed<br>shafts, uttered a leonine roar. Baffling with his own shafts the shafts<br>of his foe in that battle, the son of Drona, O king, as if smiling, then<br>struck the Pandava on the forehead with a cloth-yard shaft. The son of<br>Pandu bore that arrow on his forehead even as the proud rhinoceros, O<br>king, in the forest bears its horn. The valiant Bhima, then, in that<br>battle as if smiling all the while, struck the struggling son of Drona on<br>the forehead with three cloth-yard shafts. With those three arrows<br>sticking on his forehead, that brahmana looked beautiful like a<br>three-peaked mountain washed with water in the season of rains. The son<br>of Drona then afflicted the Pandava with hundreds of arrows, but failed<br>to shake him like the wind failing to shake the mountain. Similarly the<br>son of Pandu, filled with joy, could not in that battle shake the son of<br>Drona with his hundreds of keen shafts like torrents of rain failing to<br>shake a mountain. Shrouding each other with showers of terrible shafts<br>those two great car-warriors, those two heroes, endued with fierce might,<br>shone resplendent on those two foremost of cars of theirs. Then they<br>looked like two blazing Suns risen for the destruction of the world, and<br>engaged themselves in scorching each other with their rays representing<br>excellent arrows. Endeavouring with great care to counteract each other's<br>feats in the great battle, and actually engaged in matching deed by deed<br>with showers of arrows most fearlessly, those two foremost of men<br>careered in that combat like a couple of tigers. Both invincible and<br>terrible, arrows constituted their fangs and bows their mouths. They<br>became invisible under those clouds of arrows on all sides like the Sun<br>and the Moon in the firmament shrouded by masses of clouds. And then<br>those two chastisers of foes soon became visible and blazed forth like<br>Mars and Mercury freed from cloudy screens. Then at that instant during<br>the progress of that awful battle, Drona's son placing Vrikodara to his<br>right, poured hundreds of fierce arrows upon him like the clouds pouring<br>torrents of rain upon a mountain. Bhima, however, could not brook that<br>indication of his enemy's triumphs. The son of Pandu, O king, from that<br>very station on Ashvatthama's right, began to counteract the latter's<br>feats. Their cars continuing to wheel around in diverse ways and advance<br>and retreat (according to the exigencies of the situation), the battle<br>between those two lions among men became exceedingly furious. Careering<br>in diverse paths, and (executing) circular manoeuvres, they continued to<br>strike each other with arrows shot from their bows drawn to their fullest<br>stretch. And each made the greatest endeavours to compass the destruction<br>of the other. And each of them desired to make the other carless in that<br>battle. Then that car-warrior, viz., the son of Drona, invoked many<br>mighty weapons. The son of Pandu, however, in that battle, with his own<br>weapons, counteracted all those weapons of his foe. Then, O monarch,<br>there took place an awful encounter of weapons, like to the terrible<br>encounter of planets at the time of the universal dissolution. Those<br>shafts, O Bharata, let off by them, coming in collision, illuminated all<br>the points of the compass and thy troops also all around. Covered with<br>flights of arrows, the welkin assumed a terrible sight, like to what<br>happens, O king, at the time of the universal dissolution, when it is<br>covered with falling meteors. From the clash of shafts, O Bharata, fire<br>was generated there with sparks and blazing flames. That fire began to<br>consume both armies. Siddhas, moving there, O monarch, said these words,<br>"O lord, this battle is the foremost of all battles. Any battle (fought<br>before) does not come up to even a sixteenth part of this. A battle like<br>this will never occur again. Both these persons, viz., this brahmana and<br>this kshatriya, are endued with knowledge. Both are possessed of courage,<br>and both are fierce in prowess. Dreadful is the might of Bhima, and<br>wonderful is the skill of the other in weapons. How great is their energy<br>and how wonderful the skill possessed by both! Both of them stand in this<br>battle like two universe-destroying Yamas at the end of the Yuga. They<br>are born like two Rudras or like two Suns. These two tigers among men,<br>both endued with terrible forms, are like two Yamas in this battle." Such<br>were the words of the Siddhas heard there every moment. And among the<br>assembled denizens of heaven there arose a leonine roar. Beholding the<br>amazing and inconceivable feats of the two warriors in that battle, the<br>dense throngs of Siddhas, and Charanas were filled with wonder. And the<br>gods, the Siddhas, and the great Rishis applauded them both saying,<br>"Excellent, O mighty-armed son of Drona. Excellent, O Bhima." Meanwhile<br>those two heroes, in that battle, O king, having done injuries to each<br>other, glared at each other with eyes rolling in rage. With eyes red in<br>rage, their lips also quivered in rage. And they grinded their teeth in<br>wrath and bit their lips. And those two great car-warriors covered each<br>other with showers of arrows, as if they were in that battle two masses<br>of clouds that poured torrents of arrows for rain and that gleamed with<br>weapons constituting their lightning. Having pierced each other's<br>standards and drivers in that great battle, and having also pierced each<br>other's steeds, they continued to strike each other. Then, O monarch,<br>filled with rage, they took up in that dreadful encounter, two arrows,<br>and each desirous of slaying the other shot quickly at his foe. Those two<br>blazing arrows, resistless and endued with the force of thunder, coming,<br>O king, to the two warriors as they stood at the head of their respective<br>divisions, struck them both. Each of the two mighty combatants then<br>deeply struck with those arrows, sank, on the terrace of their respective<br>car. Understanding the son of Drona to be insensible, his driver then<br>bore him away from the battle-field, O king, in the sight of all the<br>troops. Similarly, O king, Bhima's driver bore away from the battle-field<br>on his car, the son of Pandu, that scorcher of foes, who was repeatedly<br>falling into a swoon.'"
