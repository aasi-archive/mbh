                            "Sanjaya said, 'Srutakarman then, O king, filled with wrath, struck that<br>lord of Earth, viz., Citrasena, in that battle, with fifty shafts. The<br>ruler of the Abhisars (in return), striking Srutakarman, O king, with<br>nine straight arrows, pierced his driver with five. Srutakarman then,<br>filled with rage, struck Citrasena at the head of his forces, with a keen<br>arrow in a vital part. Deeply pierced, O monarch, with that arrow by that<br>high-souled prince the heroic Citrasena felt great pain and swooned away.<br>During this interval, Srutakarman of great renown covered that lord of<br>Earth, (viz., his insensible antagonist), with ninety arrows. The mighty<br>car-warrior Citrasena then, recovering consciousness, cut off his<br>antagonist's bow with a broad-headed arrow, and pierced his antagonist<br>himself with seven arrows. Taking up another bow that was decked with<br>gold, and capable of striking hard, Srutakarman then, with his waves of<br>arrows, made Citrasena assume a wonderful appearance. Adorned with those<br>arrows, the youthful king, wearing beautiful garlands, looked in that<br>battle like a well-adorned youth in the midst of an assembly. Quickly<br>piercing Srutakarman with an arrow in the centre of the chest, he said<br>unto him, "Wait, Wait!" Srutakarman also, pierced with that arrow in the<br>battle, began to shed blood, like a mountain shedding streams of liquid<br>red chalk. Bathed in blood and dyed therewith, that hero shone in battle<br>like a flowering Kinsuka. Srutakarman, then, O king, thus assailed by the<br>foe, became filled with rage, and cut in twain the foe-resisting bow of<br>Citrasena. The latter's bow having been cut off, Srutakarman then, O<br>king, pierced him with three hundred arrows equipped with goodly wings,<br>covering him completely therewith. With another broad-headed arrow,<br>sharp-edged and keen pointed, he cut off the head, decked with head-gear<br>of his high-souled antagonist. That blazing head of Citrasena fell down<br>on the ground, like the moon loosened from the firmament upon the Earth<br>at will. Beholding the king slain, the troops of Citrasena, O sire,<br>rushed impetuously against (his slayer). That great bowman then, filled<br>with rage, rushed, shooting his shafts, against that army, like Yama<br>filled with fury, against all creatures at the time of the universal<br>dissolution. Slaughtered in that battle by thy grandson armed with the<br>bow, they quickly fled on all sides like elephants scorched by a<br>forestconflagration. Beholding them flying away, hopeless of vanquishing<br>the foe, Srutakarman, pursuing them with his keen arrows, looked<br>exceedingly resplendent (on his car). Then Prativindhya, piercing Citra<br>with five arrows, struck his driver with three and his standard with one.<br>Him Citra pierced, striking in the arms and the chest, with nine<br>broad-headed shafts equipped with wings of gold, having keen points, and<br>plumed with Kanka and peacock feathers. Then Prativindhya, O Bharata,<br>cutting off with his shafts the bow of his antagonist deeply struck the<br>latter with five keen arrows. Then Citra, O monarch, sped at thy grandson<br>a terrible and irresistible dart, adorned with golden bells, and<br>resembling a flame of fire. Prativindhya, however, in that battle, cut<br>off, with the greatest ease, into three fragments, that dart as it<br>coursed towards him like a flashing meteor. Cut off into three fragments,<br>with Prativindhya's shafts, that dart fell down, like the thunderbolt<br>inspiring all creatures with fear at the end of the Yuga. Beholding that<br>dart baffled, Citra, taking up a huge mace decked with a net-work of<br>gold, hurled it at Prativindhya. That mace slew the latter's steeds and<br>driver also in that great battle, and crushing, besides, his car, fell<br>with great impetuosity on the Earth. Meanwhile, having alighted from his<br>car, O Bharata, Prativindhya hurled at Citra a dart, well-adorned and<br>equipped with a golden staff. Catching it as it coursed towards him, the<br>high-souled king Citra, O Bharata, hurled the very weapon at<br>Prativindhya. Striking the brave Prativindhya in that battle, that<br>blazing dart, piercing through his right arm, fell down on the Earth, and<br>falling illumined the whole region like a blast of lightning. Then<br>Prativindhya, O king, filled with rage, and desiring to compass the<br>destruction of Citra, sped at him a lance decked with gold. That lance<br>penetrating through his armour and chest, entered the Earth like a mighty<br>snake in its hole. Struck with that lance, the king fell down, stretching<br>out his large and massive arms that resembled a couple of iron clubs.<br>Beholding Citra slain, thy warriors, those ornaments of battle, rushed<br>impetuously at Prativindhya from all sides. Shooting diverse kinds of<br>shafts and Sataghnis decked with rows of bells, they soon covered<br>Prativindhya like masses of clouds covering the Sun. The mighty-armed<br>Prativindhya, consuming with his arrowy showers those assailants of his<br>in that battle, routed thy army like the thunder-wielding Sakra routing<br>the Asura host. Thus slaughtered in battle by the Pandavas, thy troops, O<br>king, suddenly dispersed in all directions like congregated masses of<br>clouds dispersed by the wind. While thy army, slaughtered on all sides,<br>was thus flying away, only Drona's son singly rushed with speed against<br>the mighty Bhimasena. All at once a fierce encounter ensued between them<br>like to what had taken place between Vritra and Vasava in the battle<br>between the gods and the Asuras (of old).'"
