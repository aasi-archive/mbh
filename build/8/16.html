                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Describe to me the battle of Arjuna with the<br>samsaptakas, and of the other kings with the Pandavas. Narrate to me<br>also, O Sanjaya, the battle of Arjuna with Ashvatthama, and of the other<br>lords of the Earth with Partha.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Listen, O king, as I speak to thee as to how occurred the<br>battle of the heroic warriors (on our side) with the foe&#8212;the battle<br>which was destructive of bodies, sins, and lives. That slayer of foes,<br>viz, Partha, penetrating into the Samsaptaka force that resembled the<br>ocean, agitated it exceedingly, like a tempest agitating the vast deep.<br>Cutting off with broad-headed arrows of keen edges the heads of brave<br>warriors that were decked with faces possessed of the splendour of the<br>full moon and with beautiful eyes and eyebrows and teeth, Dhananjaya<br>speedily caused the Earth to be strewn there as if with lotuses, plucked<br>off their stalks. And in that battle Arjuna with his razor-headed shafts,<br>cut off the arms of his foes, that were all well rounded, large and<br>massive, and smeared with sandal-paste and other perfumes, with weapons<br>in grasp, with leathern gloves casing their fingers, and looking like<br>five-headed snakes. And the son of Pandu repeatedly cut off with his<br>broad-headed shafts, steeds, riders, drivers, and flags, and bows and<br>arrows, and arms decked with gems. And Arjuna in that battle, O king,<br>with many thousands of arrows, despatched to Yama's abode, car-warriors<br>and elephants and horses and horsemen. Many foremost of warriors, filled<br>with rage and roaring like bulls mad (like them) with excitement for a<br>cow in season, rushed towards Arjuna, with loud cries. All of them then<br>began to strike Arjuna with their arrows as the latter was employed in<br>slaying them, like infuriate bulls striking one of their species with<br>their horns. The battle that took place between him and them made the<br>hair to stand on end, even like the battle between the Daityas and the<br>wielder of the thunderbolt on the occasion of the conquest of the three<br>worlds. Resisting with his own weapons the weapons of his foes on all<br>sides. Arjuna, piercing them fast with innumerable arrows, took their<br>lives. Like the wind destroying vast masses of clouds, Arjuna, otherwise<br>called Jaya, that enhancer of the fears of his foes, cutting off into<br>minute fragments large throngs of cars,&#8212;cars, that is, whose poles,<br>wheels, and axles had previously been shattered by him, and whose<br>warriors and steeds and drivers had been slain before, and whose weapons<br>and quivers had been displaced, and standards crushed, and traces and<br>reins sundered, and wooden fences and shafts broken already, and filling<br>every body with wonder, achieved feats magnificent to behold and<br>rivalling those of a 1,000 great car-warriors fighting together. Crowds<br>of Siddhas and celestial Rishis and Charanas all applauded him. And<br>celestial kettle-drums sounded, and floral showers fell upon the heads of<br>Keshava and Arjuna. And an incorporeal voice said, "These viz., Keshava<br>and Arjuna, are those two heroes that always possess the beauty of the<br>moon, the splendour of fire, the force of the wind and the radiance of<br>the sun. Stationed on the same car these two heroes are invincible even<br>like Brahman and Isana. These two heroes the foremost of all creatures<br>are Nara and Narayana." Hearing and beholding these wonderful things, O<br>Bharata, Ashvatthama, with great care and resolution, rushed against<br>Krishna and Arjuna in that battle. With his arm that held an arrow in its<br>grasp, the son of Drona hailed the Pandava, shooting shafts equipped with<br>foe-slaying heads, and smilingly told him these words, "If, O hero, thou<br>regardest me a worthy guest arrived (before thee), then give me today,<br>with the whole heart, the hospitality of battle." Thus summoned by the<br>preceptor's son from desire of battle, Arjuna regarded himself highly<br>honoured, and addressing Janardana said, "The samsaptakas should be slain<br>by me, but Drona's son again is summoning me. Tell me, O Madhava, to<br>which of these duties should I first turn? First let the services of<br>hospitality be offered, if thou thinkest that to be proper." Thus<br>addressed, Krishna bore Partha who had been summoned according to the<br>rules of triumphant challenge to the vicinity of Drona's son, like Vayu<br>bearing Indra to the sacrifice. Saluting Drona's son whose mind was fixed<br>upon one thing, Keshava, said unto him, "O Ashvatthama, be cool, and<br>without losing a moment strike and bear. The time has come for those that<br>are dependent on others to repay their obligation to their masters. The<br>disputes between brahmanas are subtle. The consequences, however, of the<br>disputes of kshatriyas are palpable, being either victory or defeat. For<br>obtaining those excellent rites of hospitality that from folly thou<br>solicitest at the hands of Partha, fight coolly now with the son of<br>Pandu." Thus addressed by Vasudeva, that foremost of regenerate ones,<br>replied saying, "So be it!" pierced Keshava with sixty shafts and Arjuna<br>with three. Arjuna then, filled with rage, cut off Ashvatthama's bow with<br>three shafts. Drona's son took up another bow that was still more<br>formidable. Stringing it within the twinkling of an eye, he pierced<br>Arjuna and Keshava, the latter with three hundred arrows, and the former<br>with a 1,000. And then Drona's son, with good care, stupefying Arjuna in<br>that battle, shot thousands and tens of thousands and millions of arrows.<br>From the quivers, the bow, the bow-string, the fingers, the arms, the<br>hands, the chest, the face, the nose, the eyes, the ears, the heads, the<br>limbs, the pores of the body, the armour on his person, the car, and the<br>standard, O sire, of that utterer of Brahma, arrows began to issue.<br>Piercing Madhava and the son of Pandu with the thick arrowy shower,<br>Drona's son filled with joy, roared aloud like a vast mass of congregated<br>clouds. Hearing that roar of his, the son of Pandu said unto Keshava of<br>unfading glory these words "Behold, O Madhava, this wickedness towards me<br>of the preceptor's son. He regardeth us to be slain, having shrouded us<br>with his dense arrowy shower. I will presently, however, by my training<br>and might, baffle his purpose." Cutting off every one of those arrows<br>shot by Ashvatthama into three fragments, that foremost one of Bharata's<br>race destroyed them all like the Sun destroying a thick fog. After this<br>the son of Pandu once more pierced with his fierce shafts, the<br>samsaptakas with their steeds, drivers, cars, elephants, standards and<br>foot-soldiers. Every one of those that stood there as spectators, every<br>one of those that were stationed there on foot or car or steed or<br>elephant, regarded himself as shrouded by the arrows of Arjuna. Shot from<br>Gandiva, those winged arrows of diverse forms slew in that battle<br>elephants and steeds and men whether stationed in his immediate front or<br>at the distance of two miles. The trunks, cut off with broad-headed<br>shafts, of elephants, down whose cheeks and other limbs flowed the juice<br>indicative of excitement, fell down like tall trees in the forest struck<br>down with the axe. A little after down fell elephants, huge as hillocks,<br>with their riders, like mountains crushed by Indra with his thunder. With<br>his shafts cutting into minute portions well-equipped cars that looked<br>like dissolving edifices of vapour in the evening sky and unto which were<br>yoked well-trained steeds of great speed and which were ridden by<br>warriors invincible in battle, the son of Pandu continued to shower his<br>arrows on his enemies. And Dhananjaya continued to slay well-decked<br>horsemen and foot-soldiers of the foe. Indeed, Dhananjaya, resembling the<br>very Sun as he rises at the end of the Yuga, dried up the samsaptaka<br>ocean incapable of being dried up easily, by means of keen arrows<br>constituting his rays. Without losing a moment, the son of Pandu once<br>more pierced Drona's son resembling a huge hill, with shafts of great<br>impetuosity and the splendour of the Sun, like the wielder of the<br>thunderbolt piercing a mountain with the thunder. Desirous of battle, the<br>preceptor's son then, filled with rage, approached Arjuna for piercing<br>him and his steeds and drivers by means of his swiftly coursing shafts.<br>Arjuna, however, quickly cut off the shafts shot at him by Ashvatthama.<br>The son of Pandu then filled with great wrath, proffered unto<br>Ashvatthama, that desirable guest, quivers upon quivers of arrows, like a<br>charitable person offering everything in his house unto a guest. Leaving<br>the samsaptakas then the son of Pandu rushed towards Drona's son like a<br>donor abandoning unworthy guests, for proceeding towards one that is<br>worthy."
