                            "Sanjaya said, 'King Duryodhana, O monarch, himself fearlessly received<br>Yudhishthira, as the latter was engaged in shooting large numbers of<br>shafts. The royal Yudhishthira the just, speedily piercing thy son, that<br>mighty car-warrior, as the latter was rushing towards him with<br>impetuosity, addressed him, saying, "Wait, Wait." Duryodhana, however,<br>pierced Yudhishthira, in return, with nine keen arrows, and filled with<br>great wrath, struck Yudhishthira's driver also with a broad-headed shaft.<br>Then king Yudhishthira sped at Duryodhana three and ten arrows equipped<br>with wings of gold and whetted on stone. With four shafts that mighty<br>car-warrior then slew the four steeds of his foe, and with the fifth he<br>cut off from his trunk the head of Duryodhana's driver. With the sixth<br>arrow he felled the (Kuru) king's standard on the Earth, with the seventh<br>his bow, and with the eighth his scimitar. And then with five more shafts<br>king Yudhishthira the just deeply afflicted the Kuru monarch. Thy son,<br>then, alighting from that steedless car, stood on the Earth in imminent<br>danger. Beholding him in that situation of great peril, Karna and Drona's<br>son and Kripa and others rushed suddenly towards the spot, desirous of<br>rescuing the king. Then the (other) sons of Pandu, surrounding<br>Yudhishthira, all proceeded to the encounter, upon which, O king, a<br>fierce battle was fought. Thousands of trumpets then were blown in that<br>great engagement, and a confused din of myriad voices arose there, O<br>king. There where the Pancalas engaged the Kauravas, in battle, men<br>closed with men, and elephants with foremost of elephants. And<br>car-warriors closed with car-warriors, and horse with horse. And the<br>various couples of battling men and animals, of great prowess and armed<br>with diverse kinds of weapons and possessed of great skill presented a<br>beautiful sight, O king, over the field. All those heroes endued with<br>great impetuosity and desirous of compassing the destruction of one<br>another, fought beautifully and with great activity and skill. Observing<br>the (sanctioned) practices of warriors, they slew one another in battle.<br>None of them fought from behind others. For only a very short time that<br>battle presented a beautiful aspect. Soon it became an encounter of mad<br>men, in which the combatants showed no regard for one another. The<br>car-warrior, approaching the elephant, pierced the latter with keen<br>shafts and despatched it to Yama's presence by means of straight arrows.<br>Elephants, approaching steeds, dragged down many of them in that battle,<br>and tore them (with their tusks) most fiercely in diverse places. Large<br>numbers of horsemen also, encompassing many foremost of steeds, made a<br>loud noise with their palms, and closed with them. And those horsemen<br>slew those steeds as they ran hither and thither, as also many huge<br>elephants as these wandered over the field, from behind and the flanks.<br>Infuriate elephants, O king, routing large numbers of steeds, slew them<br>with their tusks or crushed them with great force. Some elephants, filled<br>with wrath pierced with their tusks horses with horsemen. Others seizing<br>such with great force hurled them to the ground with violence. Many<br>elephants, struck by foot-soldiers availing of the proper opportunities,<br>uttered terrible cries of pain and fled away on all sides. Among the<br>foot-soldiers that fled away in that great battle throwing down their<br>ornaments, there were many that were quickly encompassed on the field.<br>Elephant-warriors, riding on huge elephants, understanding indications of<br>victory, wheeled their beasts and causing them to seize those beautiful<br>ornaments, made the beasts to pierce them with their tusks. Other<br>foot-soldiers endued with great impetuosity and fierce might, surrounding<br>those elephant-warriors thus engaged in those spots began to slay them.<br>Others in that great battle, thrown aloft into the air by elephants with<br>their trunks, were pierced by those trained beasts with the points of<br>their tusks as they fell down. Others, suddenly seized by other<br>elephants, were deprived of life with their tusks. Others, borne away<br>from their own divisions into the midst of others, were, O king, mangled<br>by huge elephants which rolled them repeatedly on the ground. Others,<br>whirled on high like fans, were slain in that battle. Others, hither and<br>thither on the field, that stood full in front of other elephants had<br>their bodies exceedingly pierced and torn. Many elephants were deeply<br>wounded with spears and lances and darts in their cheeks and frontal<br>globes and parts between their tusks. Exceedingly afflicted by fierce<br>car-warriors and horsemen stationed on their flanks, many elephants,<br>ripped open, fell down on the Earth. In that dreadful battle many<br>horsemen on their steeds, striking foot-soldiers with their lances,<br>pinned them down to the Earth or crushed them with great force. Some<br>elephants, approaching mail-clad car-warriors, O sire, raised them aloft<br>from their vehicles and hurled them down with great force upon the Earth<br>in that fierce and awful fight. Some huge elephants slain by means of<br>cloth-yard shafts, fell down on the Earth like mountain summits riven by<br>thunder. Combatants, encountering combatants, began to strike each other<br>with their fists, or seizing each other by the hair, began to drag and<br>throw down and mangle each other. Others, stretching their arms and<br>throwing down their foes on the Earth, placed their feet on their chests<br>and with great activity cut off their heads. Some combatant, O king,<br>struck with his feet some foe that was dead, and some, O king, struck off<br>with his sword, the head of a falling foe, and some thrust his weapon<br>into the body of a living foe. A fierce battle took place there, O<br>Bharata, in which the combatants struck one another with fists or seized<br>one another's hair or wrestled with one another with bare arms. In many<br>instances, combatants, using diverse kinds of weapons, took the lives of<br>combatants engaged with others and, therefore, unperceived by them.<br>During the progress of that general engagement when all the combatants<br>were mangled in battle, hundreds and thousands of headless trunks stood<br>up on the field. Weapons and coats of mail, drenched with gore, looked<br>resplendent, like cloths dyed with gorgeous red. Even thus occurred that<br>fierce battle marked by the awful clash of weapons. Like the mad and<br>roaring current of the Ganga it seemed to fill the whole universe with<br>its uproar. Afflicted with shafts, the warriors failed to distinguish<br>friends from foes. Solicitous of victory, the kings fought on because<br>they fought that fight they should. The warriors slew both friends and<br>foes, with whom they came in contact. The combatants of both the armies<br>were deprived of reason by the heroes of both the armies assailing them<br>with fury. With broken cars, O monarch, the fallen elephants, and steeds<br>lying on the ground, and men laid low, the Earth, miry with gore and<br>flesh, and covered with streams of blood, soon became impassable, Karna<br>slaughtered the Pancalas while Dhananjaya slaughtered the Trigartas. And<br>Bhimasena, O king, slaughtered the Kurus and all the elephant divisions<br>of the latter. Even thus occurred that destruction of troops of both the<br>Kurus and the Pandavas, both parties having been actuated by the desire<br>of winning great fame, at that hour when the Sun had passed the<br>meridian.'"
