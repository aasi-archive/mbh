                            "'Karna continued, "Thou shouldst know all this, O Shalya. I shall<br>however, again speak unto thee. Listen with close attention to what I<br>say. Once on a time a brahmana came to our house as a guest. Observing<br>our practices he became highly gratified and said unto us, 'I dwelt for a<br>long time on a peak of the Himavat quite alone. Since then I have seen<br>diverse countries following diverse religions. Never, however, have I<br>seen all the people of a country act unrighteously. All the races I have<br>met will admit that to be true religion which has been declared by<br>persons conversant with the Vedas. Travelling through various countries<br>following various religions, I at last, O king, came among the Vahikas.<br>There I heard that one at first becomes a brahmana and then he becomes a<br>kshatriya. Indeed, a Vahika would, after that, become a Vaishya, and then<br>a Shudra, and then a barber. Having become a barber, he would then again<br>become a brahmana. Returning to the status of a brahmana, he would again<br>become a slave. One person in a family becomes a brahmana: all the<br>others, falling off from virtue, act as they like. The Gandharas, the<br>Madrakas, and the Vahikas of little understanding are even such. Having<br>travelled through the whole world I heard of these practices, destructive<br>of virtue, of these sinful irregularities amongst the Vahikas.' Thou<br>shouldst know all this, O Shalya. I shall, however, again speak to thee<br>about those ugly words that another said unto me regarding the Vahikas.<br>In former days a chaste woman was abducted by robbers (hailing) from<br>Aratta. Sinfully was she violated by them, upon which she cursed them,<br>saying, 'Since ye have sinfully violated a helpless girl who am not<br>without a husband, therefore, the women of your families shall all become<br>unchaste. Ye lowest of men, never shall ye escape from the consequences<br>of this dreadful sin.' It is for this, O Shalya, that the sisters' sons<br>of the Arattas, and not their own sons, become their heirs. The Kauravas<br>with the Pancalas, the Salwas, the Matsyas, the Naimishas, the Koshalas,<br>the Kasapaundras, the Kalingas, the Magadhas, and the Cedis who are all<br>highly blessed, know what the eternal religion is. The wicked even of<br>these various countries know what religion is. The Vahikas, however, live<br>without righteousness. Beginning with the Matsyas, the residents of the<br>Kuru and the Pancala countries, the Naimishas as well and the other<br>respectable peoples, the pious among all races are conversant with the<br>eternal truths of religion. This cannot be said of the Madrakas and the<br>crooked-hearted race that resides in the country of the five rivers.<br>Knowing all these things, O king, hold thy tongue, O Shalya, like one<br>deprived of utterance, in all matters connected with religion and virtue.<br>Thou art the protector and king of that people, and, therefore, the<br>partaker of sixth part of their merits and demerits. Or perhaps, thou art<br>the partaker of a sixth part of their demerits only, for thou never<br>protectest them. A king that protects is a sharer in the merits of his<br>subjects. Thou art not a sharer in their merits. In days of yore, when<br>the eternal religion was reverenced in all countries, the Grandsire,<br>observing the practices of the country of the five rivers, cried fie on<br>them. When even in the krita age, Brahman had censured the practices of<br>those fallen people of evil deeds who were begotten by Shudras on others'<br>wives, what would you now say to men in the world? Even thus did the<br>Grandsire condemn the practices of the country of the five waters. When<br>all people were observant of the duties of their respective orders, the<br>Grandsire had to find fault with these men. Thou shouldst know all this,<br>O Shalya. I shall, however, again speak to thee. A Rakshasa of the name<br>of Kalmashapada, while plunging in a tank, said, 'Eleemosynation is a<br>kshatriya's dirt, while the non-observance of vows is a brahmana's dirt.<br>The Vahikas are the dirt of the Earth, and the Madra women are the dirt<br>of the whole female sex. While sinking in the stream, a king rescued the<br>Rakshasa. Asked by the former, the latter gave this answer. I will recite<br>it to you. Listen to me. 'The mlecchas are the dirt of mankind: the<br>oilmen are the dirt of the Mlecchas; eunuchs are the dirt of oilmen; they<br>who avail of the priestly ministrations of Kshatriyas, in their<br>sacrifices, are the dirt of eunuchs. The sin of those again that have the<br>last-named persons for their priests, of also of the Madrakas, shall be<br>thine if thou do not abandon me.' Even this was declared by the Rakshasa<br>to be the formula that should be used for curing a person possessed by a<br>Rakshasa or one killed by the energy of a poison. The words that follow<br>are all very true. The Pancalas observe the duties enjoined in the Vedas;<br>the Kauravas observe truth; the Matsyas and the Surasenas perform<br>sacrifices, the Easterners follow the practices of the Shudras; the<br>Southerners are fallen; the Vahikas are thieves; the Saurashtras are<br>bastards. They that are defiled by ingratitude, theft, drunkenness,<br>adultery with the wives of their preceptors, harshness of speech,<br>slaughter of kine, lustful wanderings during the night out of home, and<br>the wearing of other people's ornaments,&#8212;what sin is there that they do<br>not incur? Fie on the Arattas and the people of the country of the five<br>rivers! Commencing with the Pancalas, the Kauravas, the Naimishas, the<br>Matsyas,&#8212;all these,&#8212;know what religion is. The old men among the<br>Northerners, the Angas, the Magadhas, (without themselves knowing what<br>virtue is) follow the practices of the pious. Many gods, headed by Agni,<br>dwell in the East. The pitris dwell in the South that is presided over by<br>Yama of righteous deeds. The West is protected by the mighty Varuna who<br>overlooks the other gods there. The north is protected by the divine Soma<br>along with the Brahmanas. So Rakshasas and Pishacas protect the Himavat,<br>the best of mountains. The Guhyakas, O great king, protect the mountains<br>of Gandhamadana. Without doubt, Vishnu, otherwise, called Janardana,<br>protects all creatures. (For all that the Vahikas have no especial<br>protectors among the gods). The Magadhas are comprehenders of signs; the<br>Koshalas comprehend from what they see; the Kurus and the Pancalas<br>comprehend from a half-uttered speech; the Salwas cannot comprehend till<br>the whole speech is uttered. The Mountaineers, like the Sivis, are very<br>stupid. The Yavanas, O king, are omniscient; the Suras are particularly<br>so. The mlecchas are wedded to the creations of their own fancy. Other<br>peoples cannot understand. The Vahikas resent beneficial counsels; as<br>regards the Madrakas there are none amongst those (mentioned above.)<br>Thou, O Shalya, art so. Thou shouldst not reply to me. The Madrakas are<br>regarded on Earth as the dirt of every nation. So the Madra woman is<br>called the dirt of the whole female sex. They that have for their<br>practices the drinking of spirits, the violation of the beds of their<br>preceptors, the destruction of the embryo by procuring miscarriage, and<br>the robbing of other people's wealth, there is no sin that they have not.<br>Fie on the Arattas and the people of the country of the five rivers.<br>Knowing this, be silent. Do not seek to oppose me. Do not let me slay<br>Keshava and Arjuna, having slain thee first.'"<br><br>"'Shalya said, "The abandonment of the afflicted and the sale of wives<br>and children are, O Karna, prevalent amongst the Angas whose king thou<br>art. Recollecting those faults of thine that Bhishma recited on the<br>occasion of the tale of Rathas and Atirathas, drive away thy wrath. Do<br>not be angry. Brahmanas may be found everywhere; Kshatriyas may be found<br>everywhere; so also Vaishyas and Shudras, O Karna, women of chastity and<br>excellent vows may also be found everywhere. Everywhere men take delight<br>in jesting with men and wounding one another. Lustful men also may be<br>found everywhere. Everyone on every occasion can command skill in<br>speaking of the faults of others. No one, however, knows his own faults,<br>or knowing them, feels shame. Everywhere are kings devoted to their<br>respective religions, and employed in chastising the wicked. Everywhere<br>may be found virtuous men. It cannot be, O Karna, that all the people of<br>a country are sinful. There are men in many countries that surpass the<br>very gods by their behaviour.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Then king Duryodhana stopped Karna and Shalya (from<br>going on with their wordy warfare), addressing the son of Radha as a<br>friend, and beseeching Shalya with joined hands, Karna, O sire, was<br>quieted by thy son and forbore saying anything more. Shalya also then<br>faced the enemy. Then Radha's son, smiling, once more urged Shalya,<br>saying, "Proceed."'"
