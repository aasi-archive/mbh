                            "Sanjaya said, 'Placing Karna at their van, thy warriors, difficult of<br>defeat in fight, returned and fought (with the foe) a battle that<br>resembled that between the gods and the Asuras. Excited by the loud<br>uproar made by elephants and men and cars and steeds and conchs,<br>elephant-men and car-warriors and foot-soldiers and horsemen, in large<br>numbers, filled with wrath advanced against the foe and slew the latter<br>with strokes of diverse kinds of weapons. Elephants and cars, steeds and<br>men, in that dreadful battle were destroyed by brave warriors with sharp<br>battle axes and swords and axes and shafts of diverse kinds and by means<br>also of their animals. Strewn with human heads that were adorned with<br>white teeth and fair faces and beautiful eyes and goodly noses, and<br>graced with beautiful diadems and earrings, and everyone of which<br>resembled the lotus, the Sun, or the Moon, the Earth looked exceedingly<br>resplendent. Elephants and men and steeds, by thousands, were slain with<br>hundreds of spiked clubs and short bludgeons and darts and lances and<br>hooks and Bhusundis and maces. The blood that fell formed a river like<br>currents on the field. In consequence of those car-warriors and men and<br>steeds and elephants slain by the foe, and lying with ghostly features<br>and gaping wounds, the field of battle looked like the domains of the<br>king of the dead at the time of universal dissolution. Then, O god among<br>men, thy troops, and those bulls amongst the Kurus, viz., thy sons<br>resembling the children of the celestials, with a host of warriors of<br>immeasurable might at their van, all proceeded against Satyaki, that bull<br>of Sini's race. Thereupon that host, teeming with many foremost of men<br>and steeds and cars and elephants, producing an uproar loud as that of<br>the vast deep, and resembling the army of the Asuras or that of the<br>celestials, shone with fierce beauty. Then the son of Surya, resembling<br>the chief of the celestials himself in prowess and like unto the younger<br>brother of Indra, struck that foremost one of Sini's race with shafts<br>whose splendour resembled the rays of the Sun. That bull of Sini's race<br>also, in that battle, then quickly shrouded that foremost of men, with<br>his car and steeds and driver, with diverse kinds of shafts terrible as<br>the poison of the snake. Then many Atirathas belonging to thy army,<br>accompanied by elephants and cars and foot-soldiers, quickly approached<br>that bull among car-warriors, viz., Vasusena, when they beheld the latter<br>deeply afflicted with the shafts of that foremost hero of Sini's race.<br>That force, however, vast as the ocean, assailed by foes possessed of<br>great quickness viz., the Pandava warriors headed by the sons of Drupada,<br>fled away from the field. At that time a great carnage occurred of men<br>and cars and steeds and elephants. Then those two foremost of men, viz.,<br>Arjuna and Keshava, having said their daily prayer and duly worshipped<br>the lord Bhava, quickly rushed against thy troops, resolved to slay those<br>foes of theirs. Their foes (i.e., the Kurus) cast their eyes cheerlessly<br>on that car whose rattle resembled the roar of the clouds and whose<br>banners waved beautifully in the air and which had white steeds yoked<br>unto it and which was coming towards them. Then Arjuna, bending Gandiva<br>and as if dancing on his car, filled the welkin and all the points of the<br>compass, cardinal and subsidiary, with showers of shafts, not leaving the<br>smallest space empty. Like the tempest destroying the clouds, the son of<br>Pandu destroyed with his arrows many cars looking like celestial<br>vehicles, that were well-adorned, and equipped with weapons and<br>standards, along with their drivers. Many elephants also, with the men<br>that guided them, adorned with truimphal banners and weapons, and many<br>horsemen with horses, and many foot-soldiers also, Arjuna despatched with<br>his arrows to Yama's abode. Then Duryodhana singly proceeded against that<br>mighty car-warrior who was angry and irresistible and resembled a<br>veritable Yama, striking him with his straight shafts. Arjuna, cutting<br>off his adversary's bow and driver and steeds and standard with seven<br>shafts, next cut off his umbrella with one arrow. Obtaining then an<br>opportunity, he sped at Duryodhana an excellent shaft, capable of taking<br>the life of the person struck. Drona's son, however, cut off that shaft<br>into seven fragments. Cutting off then the bow of Drona's son and slaying<br>the four steeds of the latter with his arrow, the son of Pandu next cut<br>off the formidable bow of Kripa too. Then cutting off the bow of<br>Hridika's son, he felled the latter's standard and steeds. Then cutting<br>off the bow of Duhshasana, he proceeded against the son of Radha. At<br>this, Karna, leaving Satyaki quickly pierced Arjuna with three arrows and<br>Krishna with twenty, and Partha again repeatedly. Although many were the<br>arrows that he shot while slaying his foes in that battle, like Indra<br>himself inspired with wrath, Karna yet felt no fatigue. Meanwhile<br>Satyaki, coming up, pierced Karna with nine and ninety fierce arrows, and<br>once more with a hundred. Then all the foremost heroes among the Parthas<br>began to afflict Karna. Yudhamanyu and Shikhandi and the sons of Draupadi<br>and the Prabhadrakas, and Uttamauja and Yuyutsu and the twins and<br>Dhrishtadyumna, and the divisions of the Cedis and the Karushas and the<br>Matsyas and Kaikeyas, and the mighty Chekitana, and king Yudhishthira of<br>excellent vows, all these, accompanied by cars and steeds and elephants,<br>and foot-soldiers of fierce prowess, encompassed Karna on all sides in<br>that battle, and showered upon him diverse kinds of weapons, addressing<br>him in harsh words and resolved to compass his destruction. Cutting off<br>that shower of weapons with his sharp shafts, Karna dispersed his<br>assailants by the power of his weapons like the wind breaking down the<br>trees that stand on its way. Filled with wrath, Karna was seen to destroy<br>car-warriors, and elephants with their riders, and horses with horse-men,<br>and large bands of foot-soldiers. Slaughtered by the energy of Karna's<br>weapons, almost the whole of that force of the Pandavas, deprived of<br>weapons, and with limbs mangled and torn, retired from the field. Then<br>Arjuna, smiling the while, baffled with his own weapons the weapons of<br>Karna and covered the welkin, the Earth, and all the points of the<br>compass with dense shower of arrows. The shafts of Arjuna fell like heavy<br>clubs and spiked bludgeons. And some amongst them fell like Sataghnis and<br>some fell like fierce thunderbolts. Slaughtered therewith, the Kaurava<br>force consisting of infantry and horse and cars and elephants, shutting<br>its eyes, uttered loud wails of woe and wandered senselessly. Many were<br>the steeds and men and elephants that perished on that occasion. Many,<br>again, struck with shafts and deeply afflicted fled away in fear.<br><br>"'Whilst thy warriors were thus engaged in battle from desire of victory,<br>the Sun approaching the Setting Mountain, entered it. In consequence of<br>the darkness, O king, but especially owing to the dust, we could not<br>notice anything favourable or unfavourable. The mighty bowmen (amongst<br>the Kauravas), fearing a night-battle, O Bharata, then retired from the<br>field, accompanied by all their combatants. Upon the retirement of the<br>Kauravas, O king, at the close of the day, the Parthas, cheerful at<br>having obtained the victory, also retired to their own encampment,<br>jeering at their enemies by producing diverse kinds of sounds with their<br>musical instruments, and applauding Acyuta and Arjuna. After those heroes<br>had thus withdrawn the army, all the troops and all the kings uttered<br>benediction upon the Pandavas. The withdrawal having been made, those<br>sinless men, the Pandavas, became very glad, and proceeding to their<br>tents rested there for the night. Then rakshasas and pishacas, and<br>carnivorous beasts, in large numbers came to that awful field of battle<br>resembling the sporting ground of Rudra himself.'
