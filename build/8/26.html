                            "Sanjaya said, 'Kripa, O king, resisted Dhrishtadyumna in battle, like a<br>Sarabha in the forest resisting a proud lion. Checked by the mighty son<br>of Gautama, Prishata's son, O Bharata, could not advance even one step.<br>Beholding Gautama's car in front of Dhrishtadyumna's, all creatures were<br>inspired with fright and regarded the latter's destruction to be at hand.<br>Car-warriors and horsemen, becoming very cheerless, said, "Without doubt,<br>this foremost of men, Sharadvata's son of mighty energy and great<br>intelligence and versed in celestial weapon, is filled with rage at the<br>death of Drona. Will Dhrishtadyumna today escape from the hands of<br>Gautama? Will this vast army escape today this great danger? Will not<br>this brahmana slay all of us together? The form that he has assumed<br>today, even like that of the Destroyer himself, shows that he will today<br>act after the manner of Drona himself. The preceptor Gautama, endued with<br>great lightness of hands, is ever victorious in battle. Possessing a<br>knowledge of weapons, he is endued with great energy and filled with<br>rage." Diverse speeches like these, uttered by the warriors of both the<br>armies were, O monarch, heard there as those two heroes encountered each<br>other. Drawing deep breath in rage, Sharadvata's son Kripa, O king, began<br>to afflict the son of Prishata in all his vital limbs while the latter<br>stood inactive. Struck in that battle by the illustrious Gautama,<br>Dhrishtadyumna, greatly stupefied, knew not what to do. His driver then,<br>addressing him said, "It is not all right with thee, O son of Prishata.<br>Never before have I seen such a calamity overtake thee in battle. It is a<br>lucky chance, it seems, that these shafts, capable of penetrating the<br>very vitals, sped by that foremost of brahmanas aiming at thy vital<br>limbs, are not striking thee. I will presently cause the car to turn<br>back, like the current of a river dashed back by the sea. I think that<br>brahmana, by whom thy prowess hath been annihilated, is incapable of<br>being slain by thee." Thus addressed, Dhrishtadyumna, O king, slowly<br>said, "My mind becometh stupefied, O sire, and perspiration covereth my<br>limbs. My body trembles and my hair stands on end. Avoiding that brahmana<br>in battle, proceed slowly to where Arjuna is, O charioteer; arrived at<br>the presence of either Arjuna or Bhimasena, prosperity may be mine. Even<br>this is my certain conviction." Then, O monarch, the charioteer, urging<br>the steeds, proceeded to the spot where the mighty bowman Bhimasena was<br>battling with thy troops. Beholding the car, O sire, of Dhrishtadyumna<br>speedily moving away from that spot, Gautama followed it, shooting<br>hundreds of shafts. And that chastiser of foes also repeatedly blew his<br>conch. Indeed, he routed the son of Prishata like Indra routing the<br>Danava Namuci.<br><br>"'The invincible Shikhandi, the cause of Bhishma's death, was in that<br>battle, resisted by Hridika's son who smiled repeatedly as he fought with<br>the former. Shikhandi, however, encountering the mighty car-warrior of<br>the Hridikas, struck him with five keen and broad-headed shafts at the<br>shoulder-joint. Then the mighty car-warrior Kritavarma filled with rage,<br>pierced his foe with sixty winged arrows. With a single arrow then, he<br>cut off his bow, laughing the while. The mighty son of Drupada, filled<br>with wrath, took up another bow, and addressing the son of Hridika, said,<br>"Wait, Wait." Then, O monarch, Shikhandi sped at his foe ninety shafts of<br>great impetuosity, all equipped with golden wings. Those shafts, however,<br>all recoiled from Kritavarma's armour. Seeing those shafts recoil and<br>scattered on the surface of the Earth, Shikhandi cut off Kritavarma's bow<br>with a keen razor-headed arrow. Filled with wrath he struck the bowless<br>son of Hridika, who then resembled a hornless bull, in the arms and the<br>chest, with eighty arrows. Filled with rage but torn and mangled with<br>shafts, Kritavarma vomited blood through his limbs like a jar disgorging<br>the water with which it is filled. Bathed in blood, the Bhoja king looked<br>beautiful like a mountain, O king, streaked with streams of liquefied red<br>chalk after a shower. The puissant Kritavarma then, taking up another bow<br>with a string and an arrow fixed thereon, struck Shikhandi in his<br>shoulder-joint. With those shafts sticking to his shoulder-joint,<br>Shikhandi looked resplendent like a lordly tree with its spreading<br>branches and twigs. Having pierced each other, the two combatants were<br>bathed in blood, and resembled a couple of bulls that have gored each<br>other with their horns Carefully exerting themselves to slay each other,<br>those two mighty car-warriors moved in a 1,000 circles with their<br>respective cars on that arena. Then Kritavarma, O king, in that<br>encounter, pierced the son of Prishata with seventy shafts all of which<br>were equipped with wings of gold and whetted on stone. The ruler of the<br>Bhojas then, that foremost of smiters, sped with great activity a<br>terrible and fatal shaft at his foe. Struck therewith, Shikhandi quickly<br>swooned away. Overcome with stupefaction, he supported himself by seizing<br>his flag-staff. The driver then of that foremost of car-warriors speedily<br>bore him away from the fight. Scorched with the shaft of Hridika's son he<br>drew breath upon breath repeatedly. After the defeat of the heroic son of<br>Drupada, O lord, the Pandava army, slaughtered on all sides, fled away<br>from the field."
