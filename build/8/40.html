                            "Sanjaya said, 'Thus rebuked by Shalya of immeasurable energy, the son of<br>Radha, feeling the propriety of his rebuker's name in consequence of his<br>wordy darts, and becoming filled with rage, answered him thus:<br><br>"'Karna said, "The merits of meritorious men, O Shalya, are known to them<br>that are themselves meritorious but not to them that are destitute of<br>merit. Thou, however, art destitute of every merit. How then canst thou<br>judge of merit and demerit? The mighty weapons of Arjuna, his wrath, his<br>energy, his bow, his shafts and the prowess also of that high-souled hero<br>are, O Shalya, well known to me. So also, O Shalya, thou dost not know,<br>so as well as I myself, the greatness of Krishna, that bull among the<br>lords of Earth. But knowing my own energy as also that of Pandu's son, I<br>challenge him to battle, O Shalya, I do not act like an insect in respect<br>of a blazing fire. I have this shaft, O Shalya, of keen mouth,<br>blood-drinking, lying alone within one quiver, equipped with wings,<br>well-steeped in oil and well-adorned. It lieth amid sandal dust,<br>worshipped by me for long years. Partaking of the nature and form of a<br>snake, it is poisonous and fierce and capable of killing large numbers of<br>men and steeds and elephants of terrible form, and exceedingly awful, it<br>is capable of piercing coats of mail and bones. Inspired with wrath, I<br>may pierce even the mighty mountains of Meru with it. That shaft I will<br>never shoot at any other person save Phalguna or Krishna, the son of<br>Devaki. In this I tell thee the truth. Listen to it. With that shaft, O<br>Shalya, I will, inspired with rage, fight with Vasudeva and Dhananjaya.<br>That would be a feat worthy of me. Of all the heroes in the Vrishni race,<br>it is Krishna in whom Prosperity is always established. Among all the<br>sons of Pandu, it is Partha in whom Victory is always established. Those<br>two tigers among men, stationed together on the same car, will advance<br>against my single self for battle. Thou shalt, O Shalya, behold today the<br>nobility of my lineage. Those two cousins, one of whom is the son of the<br>aunt and the other the son of the maternal uncle, those two invincible<br>warriors, thou shalt see, will be slain by me (with one shaft) and will<br>look like two pearls strung together in the same string. Arjuna's gandiva<br>and the ape-bearing banner, and Krishna's discus and the Garuda-bearing<br>banner, inspire with fear only those that are timid. To me, however, O<br>Shalya, they are causes of delight. Thou art a fool, of evil disposition,<br>and unskilled in the ways of great battle. Overcome with terror, thou<br>utterest these ravings. Or, thou art praising them for some reason not<br>known to me. Having slain those two first, I shall then slay thee today<br>with all thy kinsmen. Born in a sinful country thou art wicked-souled and<br>mean, and a wretch amongst kshatriyas. Being a friend, why dost thou,<br>like an enemy, frighten me with these praises of the two Krishnas? Either<br>they two will slay me today or I will slay them two. Knowing as I do my<br>own might, I do not cherish any fear of the two Krishnas. A 1,000<br>Vasudevas and hundreds of Phalgunas, I shall, single-handed, slay. Hold<br>thy tongue, O thou that art born in a sinful country. Hear from me, O<br>Shalya, the sayings, already passed into proverbs, that men, young and<br>old, and women, and persons arrived in course of their listless<br>wanderings, generally utter, as if those sayings formed part of their<br>studies, about the wicked Madrakas. brahmanas also duly narrated the same<br>things formerly in the courts of kings. Listening to those sayings<br>attentively, O fool, thou mayst forgive or rejoin. The Madraka is always<br>a hater of friends. He that hateth us is a Madraka. There is no<br>friendship in the Madraka who is mean in speech and is the lowest of<br>mankind. The Madraka is always a person of wicked soul, is always<br>untruthful and crooked. It hath been heard by us that till the moment of<br>death the Madrakas are wicked. (Amongst the Madrakas) the sire, the son,<br>the mother, the mother-in-law, the brother, the grand-son, and other<br>kinsmen, companions, strangers arrived at their homes, slaves male and<br>female, mingle together. The women of the Madrakas mingle, at their own<br>will, with men known and unknown. Of unrighteous conduct, and subsisting<br>upon fried and powdered corn and fish, in their homes, they laugh and cry<br>having drunk spirits and eaten beef. They sing incoherent songs and<br>mingle lustfully with one another, indulging the while in the freest<br>speeches. How then can virtue have a place amongst the Madrakas who are<br>arrogant and notorious for all kinds of evil acts? No one should make<br>friends with a Madraka or provoke hostilities with him. In the Madraka<br>land there is no friendship. The Madraka is always the dirt of humanity.<br>Amongst the Madrakas all acts of friendship are lost as purity amongst<br>the Gandharakas and the libations poured in a sacrifice in which the king<br>is himself the sacrificer and priest. Then again, it is truly seen that<br>wise men treat a person bit by a scorpion and affected by its poison,<br>even with these words: 'As a brahmana that assists at the religious<br>ceremonies of a Shudra suffereth degradation, as one that hateth<br>brahmanas always suffereth degradation, even so a person by making an<br>alliance with the Madrakas becometh fallen. As there is no friendship in<br>the Madraka, so, O scorpion, thy poison is nought.' With these mantras of<br>the Atharvan I have duly performed the rite of exorcism. Knowing this, O<br>learned one, hold thy tongue, or listen to something further that I will<br>say. Those women that, intoxicated by spirits, cast off their robes and<br>dance, those women that are not attached (to particular individuals) in<br>the matter of intercourse and that they do as they please without owning<br>any restrictions, I say, that being as thou art the child of one of those<br>women, how canst thou, O Madraka, be a fit person for declaring the<br>duties of men? Those women that live and answer calls of nature like<br>camels and asses, being as thou art the child of one of those sinful and<br>shameless creatures, how canst thou wish to declare the duties of men?<br>When a Madraka woman is solicited for the gift of a little quantity of<br>vinegar, she scratches her hips and without being desirous of giving it,<br>says these cruel words, 'Let no man ask any vinegar of me that is so dear<br>to me. I would give him my son, I would give him my husband, but vinegar<br>I would not give.' The young Madraka maidens, we hear, are generally very<br>shameless and hairy and gluttonous and impure. These and many other<br>things of a like nature, in respect of all their acts, from the crown of<br>their heads to the tip of their toes, are capable of being asserted of<br>them by myself and others. How, indeed, would the Madrakas and the<br>Sindhu-Sauviras know anything of duty, being born, as they are, in a<br>sinful country, being mlecchas in their practices, and being totally<br>regardless of all duties? It hath been heard by us that even this is the<br>highest duty of a kshatriya, viz., that slain in battle, he should lie<br>down on the Earth, applauded by the righteous. That I should lay down (my<br>life) in this clash of arms is my foremost wish, desirous as I am of<br>heaven through Death. I am also the dear friend of the intelligent son of<br>Dhritarashtra. For his sake are my life-breaths and whatever wealth I<br>have! As regards thyself, O thou that art born in a sinful country, it is<br>evident that thou hast been tampered with by the Pandavas, since thou<br>behavest towards us in everything like a foe. Like a righteous man that<br>is incapable of being led astray by atheists, surely I am incapable of<br>being dissuaded from this battle by hundreds of persons like thee. Like a<br>deer, covered with sweat, thou art at liberty to weep or thirst.<br>Observant as I am of the duties of a kshatriya, I am incapable of being<br>frightened by thee. I recall to my mind the end, declared unto me in past<br>times by my preceptor Rama, of those lions among men, those unreturning<br>heroes, that laid down their lives in battle. Prepared for rescuing the<br>Kauravas and slaying our foes, know that I am now determined to imitate<br>the excellent behaviour of Pururavas. I do not, O ruler of the Madrakas,<br>behold the person in the three worlds that can, I think, dissuade me from<br>this purpose. Forbear to speak, knowing all this. Why dost thou rave in<br>such a way from fear? O wretch amongst the Madrakas, I shall not now slay<br>thee and present thy carcase as an offering to carnivorous creatures.<br>From regard for a friend, O Shalya, for the sake of Dhritarashtra's son,<br>and for avoiding blame, for these three reasons, thou still livest. If, O<br>ruler of the Madras, thou speakest such words again, I shall then crush<br>thy head with my mace that is as hard as the thunder. People will today<br>see or hear, O thou that art born in a sinful country, either that the<br>two Krishnas have slain Karna or that Karna has slain the two Krishnas."<br>Having said these words, the son of Radha, O monarch, once more addressed<br>the king of the Madras, fearlessly saying, "Proceed, proceed.'"
