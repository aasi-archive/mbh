                            "Sanjaya said, 'Having with a cheerful heart gratified king Yudhishthira<br>the just, Partha, prepared to slay the Suta's son, addressed Govinda,<br>saying, "Let my car be once more equipped and let my foremost of steeds<br>be yoked thereto. Let all kinds of weapon be placed upon that great<br>vehicle. The steeds have rolled on the ground. They have been trained by<br>persons skilled in horse lore. Along with the other equipment of the car,<br>let them be quickly brought and decked in their trappings. Proceed<br>quickly, O Govinda, for the slaughter of the Suta's son." Thus addressed,<br>O monarch, by the high-souled Phalguna, Krishna commanded Daruka, saying,<br>"Do all that Arjuna, that chief of Bharata's race and that foremost of<br>all wielders of the bow, hath said." Thus ordered by Krishna, Daruka, O<br>best of kings, yoked those steeds unto that car covered with tiger-skins<br>and ever capable of scorching all foes. He then represented unto the<br>high-souled son of Pandu the fact of having equipped his vehicle.<br>Beholding the car equipped by the high-souled Daruka, Phalguna, obtaining<br>Yudhishthira's leave and causing the Brahmanas to perform propitiatory<br>rites and utter benedictions on him, ascended that excellent vehicle.<br>King Yudhishthira the just, of great wisdom, also blessed him. After<br>this, Phalguna proceeded towards Karna's car. Beholding that great bowman<br>thus proceeding, all creatures, O Bharata, regarded Karna as already<br>slain by the high-souled Pandava. All the points of the compass, O king,<br>became serene. King-fishers and parrots and herons, O king, wheeled<br>around the son of Pandu. A large number of beautiful and auspicious<br>birds, O king, called Pung, causing Arjuna (by their timely appearance)<br>to put forth greater speed in battle, cheerfully uttered their cries<br>around him. Terrible Kankas and vultures, and cranes and hawks and<br>ravens, O king, tempted by the prospect of food, proceeded in advance of<br>his car, and indicated auspicious omens foreboding the destruction of the<br>hostile host and the slaughter of Karna. And while Partha proceeded, a<br>copious perspiration covered his body. His anxiety also became very great<br>as to how he would achieve his vow. The slayer of Madhu then, beholding<br>Partha filled with anxiety as he proceeded, addressed the wielder of<br>Gandiva and said these words.<br><br>"'Vasudeva said, "O wielder of Gandiva, save thee there exists no other<br>man that could vanquish those whom thou hast vanquished with this bow of<br>thine. We have seen many heroes, who, endued with prowess like that<br>Sakra, have attained to the highest regions, encountering thy heroic self<br>in battle! Who else, O puissant one, that is not equal to thee, would be<br>safe and sound after encountering Drona and Bhishma and Bhagadatta, O<br>sire, and Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti and Sudakshina, the chief of the<br>Kambojas and Srutayudha of mighty energy and Acyutayudha as well? Thou<br>hast celestial weapons, and lightness of hand and might, and thou art<br>never stupefied in battle! Thou hast also that humility which is due to<br>knowledge! Thou canst strike with effect! Thou hast sureness of aim, and<br>presence of mind as regards the selection of means, O Arjuna! Thou art<br>competent to destroy all mobile and immobile creatures including the very<br>gods with the Gandharvas! On earth, O Partha, there is no human warrior<br>who is equal to thee in battle. Amongst all Kshatriyas, invincible in<br>battle, that wield the bow, amongst the very gods, I have not seen or<br>heard of even one that is equal to thee. The Creator of all beings, viz.,<br>Brahma himself created the great bow Gandiva with which thou fightest, O<br>Partha! For this reason there is no one that is equal to thee. I must,<br>however, O son of Pandu, say that which is beneficial to thee. Do not. O<br>mighty-armed one, disregard Karna, that ornament of battle! Karna is<br>possessed of might. He is proud and accomplished in weapons. He is a<br>maharatha. He is accomplished (in the ways of battle) and conversant with<br>all modes of warfare. He is also well-acquainted with all that suits<br>place and time. What need is there of saying much? Hear in brief, O son<br>of Pandu! I regard the mighty car-warrior Karna as thy equal, or perhaps,<br>thy superior! With the greatest care and resolution shouldst thou slay<br>him in great battle. In energy he is equal to Agni. As regards speed, he<br>is equal to the impetuosity of the wind. In wrath, he resembles the<br>Destroyer himself. Endued with might, he resembles a lion in the<br>formation of his body. He is eight ratnis in stature. His arms are large.<br>His chest is broad. He is invincible. He is sensitive. He is a hero. He<br>is, again, the foremost of heroes. He is exceedingly handsome. Possessed<br>of every accomplishment of a warrior, he is a dispeller of the fears of<br>friends. Engaged in the good of Dhritarashtra's son, he always hates the<br>sons of Pandu. No one, not even the gods with Vasava at their head, can<br>slay the son of Radha, save thee, as I think. Slay, therefore, the Suta's<br>son today. No one possessed of flesh and blood, not even the gods<br>fighting with great care, not all the warriors (of the three worlds)<br>fighting together can vanquish that car-warrior. Towards the Pandavas he<br>is always of wicked soul and sinful behaviour, and cruel, and of wicked<br>intelligence. In his quarrel with the sons of Pandu, he is actuated by no<br>consideration affecting his own interests. Slaying that Karna, therefore,<br>fulfill thy purpose today. Despatch today unto Yama's presence that<br>Suta's son, that foremost of car-warriors, whose death is near. Indeed,<br>slaying that Suta's son, that first of car-warriors, show the love for<br>Yudhishthira the just. I know thy prowess truly, O Partha, which is<br>incapable of being resisted by the gods and Asuras. The Suta's son of<br>wicked soul, from exceeding pride, always disregards the sons of Pandu. O<br>Dhananjaya, slay that man today for whose sake the wretched Duryodhana<br>regardeth himself a hero, that root of all (those) sinful persons, that<br>son of a Suta. Slay, O Dhananjaya, that tiger among men, that active and<br>proud Karna, who hath a sword for his tongue, a bow for his mouth, and<br>arrows for his teeth. I know thee well as regards the energy and the<br>might that are in thee. Slay the brave Karna in battle, like a lion<br>slaying an elephant. Slay in battle today, O Partha, that Karna,<br>otherwise called Vaikartana, in consequence of whose energy<br>Dhritarashtra's son disregards thine.'"
