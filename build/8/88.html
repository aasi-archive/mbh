                            "Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile the welkin, filled with gods and Nagas and<br>Asuras and Siddhas and Yakshas and with large bands of Gandharvas and<br>Rakshasas, and Asuras and regenerate Rishis and royal sages and birds of<br>excellent feathers, assumed a wonderful aspect. All human beings<br>assembled there beheld those beings of wonderful aspect staying in the<br>sky, and the sky itself resounded with the voice of musical instruments<br>and song and adulatory hymns and laughter and dance, and diverse other<br>kinds of charming sounds. Then both the Kaurava and the Pandava warriors,<br>filled with joy, and causing the earth and the ten points of the compass<br>to resound with the voice of musical instruments, the blare of conchs,<br>and leonine roars and the din of battle, began to slaughter their foes.<br>Teeming with men and steeds and elephants and cars and weapons,<br>unbearable to combatants in consequence of the falling of maces and<br>swords and darts and rapiers, abounding in heroes, and crowded with<br>lifeless bodies, the field of battle, crimsoned with gore, looked<br>exceedingly resplendent. Indeed, the battle between the Kurus and the<br>Pandavas then resembled that in days of yore between the gods and the<br>Asuras. After that fierce and awful battle had commenced between<br>Dhananjaya and Adhiratha's son, each of those two heroes, clad in<br>excellent mail, shrouded the ten points of the compass and the host<br>opposed to him with keen and straight arrows. A darkness having been<br>caused there with the arrows shot on that occasion, neither thy warriors<br>nor the enemy could any longer see anything. From fear all the warriors<br>there sought the protection of either Karna or Arjuna like rays of light<br>spread out in the welkin converging towards either the sun or the moon.<br>The two heroes then, each baffling the other's weapons with his own, like<br>the east and the west winds encountering each other, looked exceedingly<br>resplendent like the sun and the moon risen after dispelling the darkness<br>caused by the clouds and covering the welkin. Each having encouraged his<br>troops, saying, "Do not fly away!" the enemy and thy warriors stood their<br>ground, encircling those two mighty car-warriors like the gods and the<br>asuras standing around Vasava and Samvara. The two armies then greeted<br>those two best of men with the sounds of drums and other instruments and<br>with leonine roars, at which those two bulls among men looked beautiful<br>like the sun and the moon greeted by roaring clouds gathered around. Each<br>armed with a formidable bow drawn to a complete circle and looking like a<br>(solar or lunar) corona, those two heroes of great splendour, shooting,<br>in that battle thousands of arrows that constituted their rays, resembled<br>two unbearable suns risen at the end of the yuga for burning the entire<br>universe with its mobile and immobile creatures. Both invincible, both<br>capable of exterminating foes, each desirous of slaying the other; and<br>each displaying his skill upon the other, those two warriors, Karna and<br>the son of Pandu, closed fearlessly with each other in that dreadful<br>battle, like Indra and the asura Jambha. Invoking the mightiest of<br>weapons then, those two formidable bowmen began, with their terrible<br>shafts, to slay innumerable men and steeds and elephants as also to<br>strike each other, O king! Afflicted once more by those two foremost of<br>men, the troops of both the Kurus and the Pandavas, consisting of<br>elephants and foot-soldiers and horsemen and car-warriors, fled away on<br>all sides like other animals in the forest when assailed by the lion.<br>Then Duryodhana, and the chief of the Bhojas, and Subala's son, and<br>Kripa, and the son of Sharadvata's daughter, these five great<br>car-warriors, assailed Dhananjaya and Keshava with shafts capable of<br>producing great pain. Dhananjaya, however, with his shafts, cut off at<br>the same time the bows, the quivers, the steeds, the elephants, and the<br>cars with their drivers, of those warriors, and mangling every one of<br>them with excellent shafts, pierced the Suta's son with a dozen arrows.<br>Then a hundred cars, a hundred elephants, and a number of Saka and<br>Tukhara and Yavana horsemen, accompanied by some of the foremost<br>combatants among the Kambojas, quickly rushed against Arjuna from desire<br>of slaying him. Speedily cutting off with the shafts and razor-headed<br>arrows in his hands the excellent weapons of his foes, as also their<br>heads, and steeds, and elephants, and cars, Dhananjaya felled his<br>contending enemies on the field. Then in the welkin blasts of celestial<br>trumpets were blown by the excellent gods. These were mingled with the<br>praises of Arjuna. Blown by gentle breezes, excellent floral showers,<br>fragrant and auspicious, fell (upon Arjuna's head). Beholding that<br>incident, which was witnessed by gods and men, all creatures, O king,<br>were filled with wonder.' Only thy son and the Suta's son who were both<br>of the same opinion, felt neither pain nor wonder. Then Drona's son,<br>catching hold of Duryodhana's hand, and adopting a soothing tone,<br>addressed thy son, saying, "Be gratified, O Duryodhana! Make peace with<br>the Pandavas. There is no need for quarrel. Fie on war! The preceptor,<br>conversant with the mightiest of weapons and like unto Brahma itself,<br>hath been slain. Other bulls among men, headed by Bhishma, have also been<br>slain. As regards myself, I am unslayable, as also my maternal uncle.<br>Rule the kingdom for ever, (sharing it) with the sons of Pandu. Dissuaded<br>by me, Dhananjaya will abstain. Janardana also doth not desire<br>hostilities. Yudhishthira is always engaged in the good of all creatures.<br>Vrikodara is obedient to him. So also are the twins. Peace being made<br>between thee and the Parthas, all creatures will be benefited, through,<br>as it would seem, thy desire. Let the kings that are still alive go back<br>to their homes. Let the troops abstain from hostilities. If thou dost not<br>listen to my words, O king, struck by foes in battle, thou wilt have to<br>burn with grief. Thou hast beheld, as well as the universe, what has been<br>achieved by the single-handed Arjuna decked with diadem and garlands. The<br>slayer of Vala himself could not achieve its like, nor the Destroyer, nor<br>Prachetas, nor the illustrious king of the Yakshas. Dhananjaya, as<br>regards his merits, is even much greater than that. He will never<br>transgress whatever I say unto him. He will always follow thee. Be thou<br>gratified, O king, for the benefit of the universe. Thou always honourest<br>me greatly. I, too, bear a great friendship for thee. It is for this that<br>I say so unto thee. I shall dissuade Karna also, provided thou art<br>inclined to peace. Discerning persons say that there are four kinds of<br>friends, viz., those that are naturally so, those that are made so by<br>conciliation, those that become so through wealth, and lastly those<br>brought under subjection by the exercise of power. All these elements are<br>owned by thee with regard to the sons of Pandu. The Pandavas, O hero, are<br>naturally thy friends. Obtain them again as friends for certain by<br>conciliation. If upon thyself being gratified, they agree to become<br>friends, do thou, O king of kings, act in that way." These beneficial<br>words having been said unto him by his friends, Duryodhana reflected for<br>some time. Drawing deep breaths, he then, with a cheerless heart, said,<br>"It is as thou, O friend, hast said. Listen, however, to the words that I<br>would say unto thee. The wicked-hearted Vrikodara, having slain<br>Duhshasana like a tiger, spoke words that still dwell in my heart. Thou<br>also heardest the same. How then can there be peace? Arjuna again will<br>not be able to bear Karna in battle, like a tempest whose force is<br>weakened when encountering the mighty mountains of Meru. Nor will the<br>sons of Pritha have the least confidence in me, thinking of the many acts<br>of forceful hostility (done by me towards them). Nor, O preceptor's son<br>of unfading glory, doth it behove thee to say unto Karna now 'Abstain<br>from battle!' Phalguna is exceedingly tired today. Karna will soon slay<br>him". Having with humility said these words repeatedly unto the<br>preceptor's son, thy son commanded his own troops, saying, "Armed with<br>arrows, rush against and slay these foes. Why stand ye inactive?"'"
