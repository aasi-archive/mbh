                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Thou didst mention to me before the name of Pandya,<br>that hero of world-wide celebrity, but his feats, O Sanjaya, in battle<br>have never been narrated by thee. Tell me today in detail of the prowess<br>of that great hero, his skill, spirit, and energy, the measure of his<br>might, and his pride.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and Drona's son and Karna and<br>Arjuna and Janardana, those thorough masters of the science of weapons,<br>are regarded by thee as the foremost of car-warriors. Know, however, that<br>Pandya regarded himself superior to all these foremost of car-warriors in<br>energy. Indeed he never regarded any one amongst the kings as equal to<br>himself. He never admitted his equality with Karna and Bhishma. Nor did<br>he admit within his heart that he was inferior in any respect to Vasudeva<br>or Arjuna. Even such was Pandya, that foremost of kings, that first of<br>wielder of weapons. Filled with rage like the Destroyer himself, Pandya<br>at the time was slaughtering the army of Karna. That force, swelling with<br>cars and steeds and teeming with foremost of foot-soldiers, struck by<br>Pandya, began to turn round like the potter's wheel. Like the wind<br>dispersing a mass of congregated clouds, Pandya, with his well shot<br>arrows, began to disperse that force, destroying its steeds and drivers<br>and standards and cars and causing its weapons and elephants to fall<br>down. Like the splitter of mountains striking down mountains with his<br>thunder, Pandya overthrew elephants with their riders, having previously<br>cut down the standards and banners and weapons with which they were<br>armed, as also the foot-soldiers that protected those beasts. And he cut<br>down horses, and horsemen with their darts and lances and quivers.<br>Mangling with his shafts the Pulindas, the Khasas, the Bahlikas, the<br>Nishadas, the Andhakas, the Tanganas, the Southerners, and the Bhojas,<br>all of whom, endued with great courage, were unyielding and obstinate in<br>battle, and divesting them of their weapons and coats of mail, Pandya<br>deprived them of their lives. Beholding Pandya destroying with his shafts<br>in battle that host consisting of four kinds of forces, the son of Drona<br>fearlessly proceeded towards that fearless warrior. Fearlessly addressing<br>in sweet words that warrior who then seemed to dance on his car, Drona's<br>son, that foremost of smiters, smiling the while, summoned him and said,<br>"O king, O thou with eyes like the petals of the lotus, thy birth is<br>noble and learning great. Of celebrated might and prowess, thou<br>resemblest Indra himself. Stretching with thy two massive arms the bow<br>held by thee and whose large string is attached to thy grasp, thou<br>lookest beautiful like a mass of congregated clouds as thou pourest over<br>thy foes thick showers of impetuous shafts. I do not see anybody save<br>myself that can be a match for thee in battle. Alone thou crushest<br>numerous cars and elephants and foot-soldiers and steeds, like the<br>fearless lion of terrible might crushing herds of deer in the forest.<br>Making the welkin and the Earth resound with the loud clatter of thy<br>car-wheels thou lookest resplendent, O king, like a crop-destroying<br>autumnal cloud of loud roars. Taking out of thy quiver and shooting thy<br>keen shafts resembling snakes of virulent poison fight with myself only,<br>like (the asura) Andhaka fighting with the three-eyed deity." Thus<br>addressed, Pandya answered, "So be it." Then Drona's son, telling him<br>"Strike," assailed him with vigour. In return, Malayadhwaja pierced the<br>son of Drona with a barbed arrow. Then Drona's son, that best of<br>preceptors, smiling the while, struck Pandya with some fierce arrows,<br>capable of penetrating into the very vitals and resembling flames of<br>fire. Then Ashvatthama once more sped at his foe some other large arrows<br>equipped with keen points and capable of piercing the very vitals,<br>causing them to course through the welkin with the ten different kinds of<br>motion. Pandya, however, with nine shafts of his cut off all those arrows<br>of his antagonist. With four other shafts he afflicted the four steeds of<br>his foe, at which they speedily expired. Having then, with his sharp<br>shafts, cut off the arrows of Drona's son, Pandya then cut off the<br>stretched bow-string of Ashvatthama, endued with the splendour of the<br>sun. Then Drona's son, that slayer of foes, stringing his unstringed bow,<br>and seeing that his men had meanwhile speedily yoked other excellent<br>steeds unto his car, sped thousands of arrows (at his foe). By this, that<br>regenerate one filled the entire welkin and the ten points of the compass<br>with his arrows. Although knowing that those shafts of the high-souled<br>son of Drona employed in shooting were really inexhaustible, yet Pandya,<br>that bull among men, cut them all into pieces. The antagonist of<br>Ashvatthama, carefully cutting off all those shafts shot by the latter,<br>then slew with his own keen shafts the two protectors of the latter's car<br>wheels in that encounter. Beholding the lightness of hand displayed by<br>his foe, Drona's son, drawing his bow to a circle, began to shoot his<br>arrows like a mass of clouds pouring torrents of rain. During that space<br>of time, O sire, which consisted only of the eighth part of a day, the<br>son of Drona shot as many arrows as were carried on eight carts each<br>drawn by eight bullocks. Almost all those men that then beheld<br>Ashvatthama, who at the time looked like the Destroyer himself filled<br>with rage, or rather the Destroyer of the Destroyer, lost their senses.<br>Like a mass of clouds at the close of summer drenching with torrents of<br>rain, the Earth with her mountains and trees, the preceptor's son poured<br>on that hostile force his arrowy shower. Baffling with the Vayavya weapon<br>that unbearable shower of arrows shot by the Ashvatthama-cloud, the<br>Pandya-wind, filled with joy, uttered loud roars. Then Drona's son<br>cutting off the standard, smeared with sandal-paste and other perfumed<br>unguents and bearing the device of the Malaya mountain on it, of the<br>roaring Pandya, slew the four steeds of the latter. Slaying then his<br>foe's driver with a single shaft, and cutting off with a crescent-shaped<br>arrow the bow also of that warrior whose twang resembled the roar of the<br>clouds, Ashvatthama cut off his enemy's car into minute fragments.<br>Checking with the weapons those of his enemy, and cutting off all the<br>weapons of the latter, Drona's son, although he obtained the opportunity<br>to do his enemy the crowning evil, still slew him not, from desire of<br>battling with him for some time more. Meanwhile Karna rushed against the<br>large elephant force of the Pandavas and began to rout and destroy it.<br>Depriving car-warriors of their cars, he struck elephants and steeds and<br>human warriors, O Bharata, with innumerable straight shafts. That mighty<br>bowman, the son of Drona, although he had made Pandya, that slayer of<br>foes and foremost of car-warriors, carless, yet he did not slay him from<br>desire of fight. At that time a huge riderless elephant with large tusks,<br>well-equipped with all utensils of war, treading with speed, endued with<br>great might, quick to proceed against any enemy, struck with<br>Ashvatthama's shafts, advanced towards the direction of Pandya with great<br>impetuosity, roaring against a hostile compeer. Beholding that prince of<br>elephants, looking like a cloven mountain summit, Pandya, who was well<br>acquainted with the method of fighting from the neck of an elephant,<br>quickly ascended that beast like a lion springing with a loud roar to the<br>top of a mountain summit. Then that lord of the prince of mountains,<br>striking the elephant with the hook, and inspired with rage, and with<br>that cool care for which he was distinguished in hurling weapons with<br>great force, quickly sped a lance, bright as Surya's rays, at the<br>preceptor's son and uttered a loud shout. Repeatedly shouting in joy,<br>"Thou art slain, Thou art slain!" Pandya (with that lance) crushed to<br>pieces the diadem of Drona's son adorned with foremost of jewels and<br>diamonds of the first water and the very best kind of gold and excellent<br>cloth and strings of pearls. That diadem possessed of the splendour of<br>the Sun, the Moon, the planets, or the fire, in consequence of the<br>violence of the stroke, fell down, split into fragments, like a mountain<br>summit riven by Indra's thunder, falling down on the Earth with great<br>noise. At this, Ashvatthama blazed up with exceeding rage like a prince<br>of snakes struck with the foot, and took up four and ten shafts capable<br>of inflicting great pain upon foes and each resembling the Destroyer's<br>rod. With five of those shafts he cut off the four feet and the trunk of<br>his adversary's elephant, and with three the two arms and the head of the<br>king, and with six he slew the six mighty car-warriors, endued with great<br>effulgence, that followed king Pandya. Those long and well-rounded arms<br>of the king, smeared with excellent sandal-paste, and adorned with gold<br>and pearls and gems and diamonds falling upon the Earth, began to writhe<br>like a couple of snakes slain by Garuda. That head also, graced with a<br>face bright as the full Moon, having a prominent nose and a pair of large<br>eyes, red as copper with rage, adorned with earrings, falling on the<br>ground, looked resplendent like the Moon himself between two bright<br>constellations. The elephant, thus cut off by that skilful warrior into<br>six pieces with those five shafts and the king into four pieces with<br>those three shafts lay divided in all into ten pieces that looked like<br>the sacrificial butter distributed into ten portions intended for the ten<br>deities. Having cut off numerous steeds and men and elephants into pieces<br>and offered them as food into the Rakshasas, king Pandya was thus quieted<br>by Drona's son with his shafts like a blazing fire in a crematorium,<br>extinguished with water after it has received a libation in the shape of<br>a lifeless body. Then like the chief of the celestials joyfully<br>worshipping Vishnu after the subjugation of the Asura Vali, thy son, the<br>king, accompanied by his brothers approaching the preceptor's son<br>worshipped with great respect that warrior who is a complete master of<br>the science of arms, after indeed, he had completed the task he had<br>undertaken."
