                            "Sanjaya said, 'Learning that Nakula had been deprived of his car,<br>afflicted with arrows and mangled with the weapons of Karna's son, and<br>that he had his shafts, bow, and sword cut off, these eleven formidable<br>resisters of all foes, the five heroic sons of Drupada, the grandson of<br>Sini forming the sixth, and the five sons of Draupadi quickly proceeded<br>on their loud-sounding cars drawn by bounding steeds, with banners waving<br>in the air, and guided by accomplished drivers. Those well-armed warriors<br>began to destroy thy elephants and cars and men and steeds with shafts<br>that resembled formidable snakes. Then Hridika's son and Kripa and<br>Drona's son and Duryodhana and Shakuni's son and Vrika and Kratha and<br>Devavridha, those foremost of Kaurava car-warriors, speedily proceeded<br>against them, armed with their bows and mounted upon their cars of rattle<br>deep as the roar of elephants or the clouds. These Kaurava warriors,<br>assailing those foremost of men and first of car-warriors, those eleven<br>heroes (of the Pandava army), O king, with the mightiest of shafts,<br>checked their progress. At this, the Kulindas, riding upon their<br>elephants of impetuous speed that looked like mountain summits and that<br>were of the hue of newly-risen clouds, advanced against those Kaurava<br>heroes. Well-equipped, and covered with gold, those infuriated elephants,<br>born in Himalayan regions and ridden by accomplished warriors longing for<br>battle, looked resplendent like clouds in the welkin, charged with<br>lightning. The prince of the Kulindas then vigorously assailed Kripa and<br>his driver and steeds, with ten shafts made wholly of iron. Struck (in<br>return) with the shafts of Sharadvata's son, the prince fell down with<br>his elephant on the ground. The younger brother of that prince then,<br>assailing Kripa's car with a number of lances made wholly of iron and all<br>bright as the rays of the sun, uttered loud roars. The ruler of the<br>Gandharvas, however, cut off the head of that warrior while still<br>uttering those roars. Upon the fall of those Kulindas, those mighty<br>car-warriors of thy army, filled with joy, blew their sea-born conchs,<br>and, armed with bows, rushed against their enemies. The battle then that<br>once more took place between the Kurus on the one side and the Pandavas<br>and the Srinjayas on the other, with arrows and scimitars and darts and<br>swords and maces and battle-axes, became fierce and awful and exceedingly<br>destructive of men and steeds and elephants. Car-warriors and steeds and<br>elephants and foot-soldiers, striking one another, fell down on the<br>ground, making the field of battle look like the welkin when congregated<br>masses of clouds charged with lightning and producing incessant peals of<br>thunder are assailed by fierce winds from all sides. Then the chief of<br>the Bhojas struck the huge elephants, the car-warriors, the innumerable<br>foot-soldiers, and the horse under Satanika. Struck with Kritavarma's<br>shafts, these soon fell down on the ground. About this time, struck with<br>Ashvatthama's shafts, three huge elephants equipped with all kinds of<br>weapons, ridden by accomplished warriors, and adorned with lofty<br>standards, fell down lifeless on the ground like gigantic cliffs riven by<br>thunder. Then the third brother of the Kulinda chief assailed thy son<br>Duryodhana with some excellent shafts in the centre of the chest. Thy<br>son, however, pierced him as also his elephant with many whetted shafts.<br>That prince of elephants then, with the prince on his back, fell down,<br>with streams of blood issuing from every part of his body, like a<br>mountain of red chalk in the season of rains, with red streams running<br>down its breast, tumbling down when riven by the thunder of Sachi's lord.<br>The Kulinda prince, however, having saved himself in time, rode another<br>elephant. Urged by the prince, that animal assailed Kratha with his<br>driver and steeds and car. Pierced, however, with Kratha's shafts, that<br>elephant, with its rider, fell down like a thunder-riven hill. The ruler<br>of the Krathas, that invincible car-warrior, however, struck with shafts<br>by the prince born on the mountains from the back of another elephant,<br>fell down with his steeds, driver, bow, and standard, like a mighty tree<br>uprooted by the tempest. Then Vrika deeply pierced with a dozen shafts<br>that prince having his abode on the Himavat as he stood on his elephant.<br>The huge beast quickly crushed with his four legs (the Kaurava warrior)<br>Vrika with his steeds and car. That prince of elephants then, with its<br>rider, deeply pierced by the son of Vabhru, advanced impetuously against<br>the latter. Vabhru's son, however, that prince of the Magadhas, afflicted<br>with arrows by Sahadeva's son, fell down. The prince of the Kulindas<br>then, with that elephant of his which was capable of slaying the foremost<br>of warriors with its tusks and body, rushed impetuously towards Shakuni<br>for slaying him. The mountaineer succeeded in afflicting Shakuni greatly.<br>Soon, however, the chief of the Gandharas cut off his head. About this<br>time huge elephants and steeds and car-warriors and large bands of foot,<br>struck by Satanika, fell down on the earth, paralysed and crushed like<br>snakes beaten by the tempest caused by Garuda's wings. Then a Kulinda<br>warrior (on the Kaurava side), smiling the while, pierced Satanika, the<br>son of Nakula, with many whetted arrows. Nakula's son, however, with a<br>razor-headed arrow, cut off from his antagonist's trunk his head<br>resembling a lotus. Then Karna's son pierced Satanika with three arrows,<br>made wholly of iron and Arjuna also with as many. And he pierced Bhima<br>with three arrows and Nakula with seven and Janardana with a dozen.<br>Beholding that feat of Vrishasena, that achiever of superhuman feats, the<br>Kauravas became filled with joy and applauded him greatly. They, however,<br>that were conversant with Dhananjaya's prowess, regarded Vrishasena as a<br>libation already poured on the fire. The diadem-decked Arjuna then, that<br>slayer of hostile heroes, seeing Madri's son Nakula, that foremost of<br>men, deprived of his steeds in the midst of all, and beholding Janardana<br>mangled with arrows, rushed in that battle against Vrishasena who was<br>then staying in front of the Suta's son (Karna). Like Namuci rushing<br>against Indra, Karna's son, that great car-warrior, also rushed, in that<br>battle, against that fierce and foremost of men, Arjuna, that warrior<br>possessing thousands of arrows, as the latter advanced towards him.<br>Unsupported by any one, the high-souled son of Karna, quickly piercing<br>Partha with a shaft in that battle, uttered a loud shout, like Namuci in<br>days of old after having pierced Indra. Once more Vrishasena pierced<br>Partha in the left arm-pit with many formidable shafts. Piercing Krishna<br>next with nine arrows, he struck Partha again with ten shafts. The<br>white-steeded Arjuna, having before been pierced by Vrishasena with those<br>formidable arrows, became slightly enraged and set his heart on the<br>slaughter of Karna's son. The high-souled and diadem-decked Arjuna then,<br>his brow furrowed from wrath with three lines, quickly sped from the van<br>of battle a number of shafts for the destruction of Vrishasena in that<br>encounter. With eyes red in wrath, that hero capable of slaying Yama<br>himself if the latter fought with him, then laughed terribly and said<br>unto Karna and all the other Kaurava heroes headed by Duryodhana and<br>Drona's son, these words, "Today, O Karna, in thy very sight in this<br>battle, I will despatch the fierce Vrishasena unto Yama's abode with my<br>keen arrows! People say that all of you, united together, slew my son,<br>endued with great activity, in my absence, and while he was alone and<br>unsupported on his car. I, however, will slay thy son in the very sight<br>of you all. Let all the Kaurava car-warriors protect him. I will slay the<br>fierce Vrishasena. After that, I will slay thee, O fool, even I, Arjuna,<br>in the midst of battle! Today I will, in battle, slay thee that art the<br>root of this quarrel and that hast become so proud in consequence of<br>Duryodhana's patronage. Putting forth my strength, I will certainly slay<br>thee in this battle, and Bhimasena will slay this Duryodhana, this wretch<br>among men, through whose evil policy this quarrel born of dice hath<br>arisen." Having said these words, Arjuna rubbed the string of his bow and<br>took aim at Vrishasena in that battle, and sped, O king, a number of<br>shafts for the slaughter of Karna's son. The diadem-decked Arjuna then,<br>fearlessly and with great force, pierced Vrishasena with ten shafts in<br>all his vital limbs. With four fierce razor-headed arrows he cut off<br>Vrishasena's bow and two arms and head. Struck with Partha's shafts, the<br>son of Karna, deprived of arms and head, fell down on the earth from his<br>car, like a gigantic shala adorned with flowers falling down from a<br>mountain summit. Beholding his son, thus struck with arrows, fall down<br>from his vehicle, the Suta's son Karna, endued with great activity and<br>scorched with grief on account of the death of his son, quickly proceeded<br>on his car, inspired with wrath, against the car of the diadem-decked<br>Partha.<br><br>"Indeed, beholding his son slain in his sight by the white-steeded Arjuna<br>in battle, the high-souled Karna, filled with great wrath, rushed against<br>Krishna and Arjuna.'"
