                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Thou hast, O son, mentioned the names of those of<br>my side that have been slain in battle by the Pandavas. Tell me now, O<br>Sanjaya, the names of those amongst the Pandavas that have been slain by<br>the people of my side!'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'The Kuntis possessed of great prowess in battle, endued<br>with great energy and great might, have been slain in fight by Bhishma,<br>with all their kinsmen and advisers. The Narayanas, the Valabhadras, and<br>hundreds of other heroes, all devoted (to the Pandavas) have been slain<br>in battle by the heroic Bhishma. Satyajit, who was equal to the<br>diadem-decked Arjuna himself in battle as regards energy and might, hath<br>been slain in battle by Drona of sure aim. Many mighty bowmen among the<br>Pancalas, all of whom were skilled in battle, encountering Drona, have<br>repaired to Yama's abode. So the two kings Virata and Drupada, both<br>venerable in years, who exerted themselves with great prowess for their<br>ally, have, with their sons, been slain in battle by Drona. That<br>invincible hero, viz., Abhimanyu, who, though a child in years, was still<br>equal in battle to Arjuna or Keshava or Baladeva, O lord, that, warrior<br>who was highly accomplished in battle, after making an immense slaughter<br>of the foe, was at last encompassed by six foremost of car-warriors and<br>slain by them. Unable to resist Arjuna himself, they thus slew Arjuna's<br>son! Deprived of his car, that hero, viz., the son of Subhadra, still<br>stayed in battle, remembering the duties of a Kshatriya. At last, O king,<br>Duhshasana's son slew him on the field. The slayer of the Patachchatras,<br>viz., the handsome son of Amvashtha, surrounded by a large force, had put<br>forth all his prowess for the sake of his allies. Having made a great<br>slaughter among the foe, he was encountered by Duryodhana's son, the<br>brave Lakshmana, in battle and despatched to Yama's abode. The mighty<br>bowman Vrihanta, accomplished in arms and invincible in battle, hath been<br>despatched to Yama's abode by Duhshasana, exerting himself with great<br>prowess. The two kings Manimat and Dandadhara, both of whom were<br>invincible in battle and had put forth their prowess for their allies,<br>have been slain by Drona. Ansumat the ruler of the Bhojas, that mighty<br>car-warrior at the head of his own forces, hath been despatched to Yama's<br>abode by Drona exerting himself with great prowess. Citrasena, the ruler<br>of the sea-coast, with his son, O Bharata, hath been forcibly despatched<br>by Samudrasena to Yama's abode. Another ruler of a maritime country,<br>viz., Nila, and Vyaghradatta of great energy, have both, O king, been<br>despatched to Yama's abode by Ashvatthama. Citrayudha and Citrayodhin,<br>after making a great slaughter, have both been slain in battle by Vikarna<br>exerting himself with great prowess and displaying diverse manoeuvres of<br>his car. The chief of the Kaikeyas, who was equal to Vrikodara himself in<br>battle and surrounded by Kaikeya warriors, has been slain by Kaikeya, the<br>brother by the brother. Janamejaya of the hilly country, endued with<br>great prowess and accomplished in encounters with the mace, hath, O king,<br>been slain by thy son Durmukha. Those two foremost of men, viz., the<br>brothers Rochamana, like two brilliant planets, have together been<br>despatched to heaven by Drona with his shafts. Many other kings, O<br>monarch, endued with great prowess, have fought (for the Pandavas) Having<br>achieved the most difficult feats, all of them have gone to Yama's abode.<br>Purujit and Kuntibhoja, the two maternal uncles of Savyasaci, have been<br>despatched by Drona with shafts to such regions as are attained by death<br>in battle. Abhibhu the Kasis, at the head of many of his followers, hath<br>been obliged by Vasudana's son to lay down his life in battle. Yudhamanyu<br>of immeasurable prowess, and Uttamauja of great energy, after slaying<br>hundreds of heroic warriors, have themselves been slain by our men. The<br>Pancala prince Mitravarman, O Bharata, those two foremost of bowmen, have<br>been despatched to Yama's abode by Drona. Shikhandi's son Kshatradeva,<br>that foremost of warriors, possessed of great bravery, hath, O king, been<br>slain by thy grandson Lakshmana, O sire! The two heroes Sucitra and<br>Citravarman, who were sire and son and endued with great might, and who<br>careered fearlessly in battle, have been slain by Drona. Vardhakshemi, O<br>monarch, who was like the ocean at full tide, having had his weapons<br>exhausted in battle, hath at last obtained undisturbed peace. That<br>foremost of Sutas, viz., Senavindu, having consumed many foes in battle,<br>hath, at last, O king been slain by Bahlika. Dhrishtaketu, O monarch,<br>that foremost of car-warriors among the Cedis, after accomplishing the<br>most difficult feats, hath repaired to the abode of Yama. Similarly, the<br>heroic Satyadhriti, endued with great prowess, having made a great<br>slaughter in battle for the sake of the Pandavas, has been despatched to<br>Yama's abode. That lord of Earth, viz., Suketu, the son of Shishupala,<br>having slain many foes, hath at last been slain by Drona in battle.<br>Virata's son Sankha, as also Uttara of great strength, having<br>accomplished the most difficult feats, have repaired to Yama's abode.<br>Similarly, Satyadhriti of the Matsyas, and Madiraswa of great energy, and<br>Suryadatta possessed of great prowess, have all been slain by Drona with<br>his shafts. Srenimat also, O monarch, having fought with great prowess<br>and accomplished the most difficult feats, hath repaired to Yama's abode.<br>Similarly, the chief of the Magadhas, that slayer of hostile heroes,<br>endued with great energy and acquainted with the highest weapons,<br>sleepeth on the field of battle, slain by Bhishma. Vasudana also, having<br>made an immense carnage in battle, has been despatched to Yama's abode by<br>Bharadwaja's son exerting himself with great prowess. These and many<br>other mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas have been slain by Drona<br>exerting himself with great energy. I have now told them all that thou<br>hadst asked me.'"
