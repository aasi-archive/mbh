                            "Sanjaya said, 'The world regards thee to be equal to Yayati the son of<br>Nahusha, in beauty, birth, fame, asceticism, and learning! Indeed, in<br>learning, thou art, O king, like a great rishi, highly accomplished and<br>crowned with success! Summon thy fortitude! Do not yield to grief!'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'I think destiny is supreme, and exertion fruitless<br>since even Karna, who was like a shala tree, hath been slain in battle!<br>Having slaughtered Yudhishthira's army and the large throngs of the<br>Pancala car-warriors, having scorched all the points of the compass by<br>means of his arrowy showers, having stupefied the Parthas in battle like<br>the wielder of the thunderbolt stupefying the asuras, alas, how could<br>that mighty car-warrior, slain by the foe, fall down on the earth like a<br>large tree uprooted by the tempest? Indeed, I do not behold the end of my<br>sorrows like a drowning man unable to see the end of the ocean. My<br>anxieties are increasing, I do not desire to live, hearing of Karna's<br>death and Phalguni's victory! Indeed O Sanjaya, I regard the slaughter of<br>Karna to be highly incredible. Without doubt, this hard heart of mine is<br>made of the essence of adamant, for it does not burst into a 1,000<br>fragments upon hearing of the fall of Karna! Without doubt, the gods<br>ordained, before (my birth), a very long life for me, since sore<br>distressed on hearing of the death of Karna, I do not die! Fie, O<br>Sanjaya, on this life of one that is destitute of friends. Brought today,<br>O Sanjaya, to this wretched plight, miserably shall I have to live, of<br>foolish understanding that I am, pitied by all! Having formerly been the<br>honoured of the whole world, how shall I, O Suta, live, overridden by<br>foes? From pain to greater pain and calamity, have I come, O Sanjaya, in<br>consequence of the fall of Bhishma and Drona and the high-souled Karna! I<br>do not see that anyone (of my army) will escape with life when the Suta's<br>son hath been slain in battle! He was the great raft, O Sanjaya, to my<br>sons! That hero, having shot innumerable arrows, hath been slain in<br>battle! What use have I of life, without that bull among men? Without<br>doubt, the son of Adhiratha, afflicted with arrows, fell down from his<br>car, like a mountain-peak riven by the fall of thunder! Without doubt,<br>bathed in blood, he lieth, adorning the Earth, like an elephant slain by<br>an infuriate prince of elephants! He who was the strength of the<br>Dhartarashtras, he who was an object of fear to the sons of Pandu, alas,<br>he viz., Karna, that pride of all bowman, hath been slain by Arjuna! He<br>was a hero, a mighty bowman, the dispeller of the fears of my sons! Alas,<br>that hero, reft of life, lieth (on the earth), like mountain struck down<br>by Indra! The fulfilment of Duryodhana's wishes is even like locomotion<br>to one that is lame, or the gratification of the poor man's desire, or<br>stray drops of water to one that is thirsty! Planned in one way, our<br>schemes end otherwise. Alas, destiny is all powerful, and time incapable<br>of being transgressed! Was my son Duhshasana, O Suta, slain, while flying<br>away from the field, humbled (to the dust), of cheerless soul, and<br>destitute of all manliness? O son, O Sanjaya, I hope he did no dastardly<br>act on that occasion? Did not that hero meet with his death like the<br>other kshatriyas that have fallen? The foolish Duryodhana did not accept<br>Yudhishthira's constant advice, wholesome as medicine, against the<br>propriety of battle. Possessed of great renown, Partha, when begged for<br>drink by Bhishma then lying on his arrowy bed, pierced the surface of the<br>earth! Beholding the jet of water caused by the son of Pandu, the<br>mighty-armed (Bhishma, addressing Duryodhana), said, "O sire, make peace<br>with the Pandavas! Hostilities ceasing, peace will be thine! Let the war<br>between thyself and thy cousins end with me! Enjoy the earth in<br>brotherliness with the sons of Pandu!" Having disregarded those counsels,<br>my child is certainly repenting now. That has now come to pass which<br>Bhishma of great foresight said. As regards myself, O Sanjaya, I am<br>destitute of counsellors and reft of sons! In consequence of gambling, I<br>am fallen into great misery like a bird shorn of its wings! As children<br>engaged in sport, O Sanjaya, having seized a bird and cut off its wings,<br>merrily release it, but the creature cannot achieve locomotion in<br>consequence of its winglessness; even so have I become, like a bird shorn<br>of its wings! Weak, destitute of every resource, without kinsmen and<br>deprived of relatives and friends, cheerless and overpowered by enemies,<br>to which point of the compass shall I go? He who vanquished all the<br>Kambojas and the Amvashthas with the Kaikeyas, that puissant one, who,<br>having for the accomplishment of his purpose vanquished the Gandharas and<br>the Videhas in battle, subjugated the whole Earth for the sake of<br>Duryodhana's aggrandisement, alas, he hath been vanquished by the heroic<br>and strong Pandavas endued with mighty arms! Upon the slaughter, in<br>battle, of that mighty bowman, Karna, by the diadem-decked (Arjuna), tell<br>me, O Sanjaya, who were these heroes that stayed (on the field)! I hope<br>he was not alone and abandoned (by friends) when slain in battle by the<br>Pandavas? Thou hast, O sire, told me, before this, how our brave warriors<br>have fallen. With his powerful shafts Shikhandi felled in battle that<br>foremost of all wielders of weapons, viz., Bhishma, who did nothing to<br>repel the attack. Similarly, Sanjaya, Drupada's son Dhrishtadyumna,<br>uplifting his scimitar, slew the mighty bowman Drona who, already pierced<br>with many arrows, had laid aside his weapons in battle and devoted<br>himself to Yoga. These two were both slain at a disadvantage and<br>especially by deceit. Even this is what I have heard about the slaughter<br>of Bhishma and Drona! Indeed, Bhishma and Drona, while contending in<br>fight, were incapable of being slain in battle by the wielder of the<br>thunderbolt himself by fair means. This that I tell thee is the truth! As<br>regards Karna, how, indeed, could Death touch him, that hero equal unto<br>Indra himself, while he was engaged in shooting his manifold celestial<br>weapons? He unto whom in exchange for his earrings, Purandara had given<br>that foe slaying, gold-decked, and celestial dart of the splendour of<br>lightning,&#8212;he who had, lying (within his quiver) amid sandal-dust, that<br>snake-mouthed celestial arrow decked with gold, equipped with goodly<br>wings, and capable of slaying all foes, he who, disregarding those heroic<br>and mighty car-warriors having Bhishma and Drona at their head, had<br>acquired from Jamadagni's son the terrible brahmastra, that mighty-armed<br>one, who, having seen the warriors with Drona at their head afflicted<br>with arrows and turn away from the field, had cut off with his keen<br>shafts the bow of Subhadra's son, he who, having in a trice deprived the<br>invincible Bhimasena endued with the might of 10,000 elephants and the<br>speed of the wind, of his car, had laughed at him,&#8212;he who, having<br>vanquished Sahadeva by means of his straight shafts and made him carless,<br>slew him not from compassion and considerations of virtue,&#8212;he who, with<br>Shakra's dart, slew that prince of rakshasas, Ghatotkaca, who from desire<br>of victory, had invoked a 1,000 kinds of illusions,&#8212;he whose feats in<br>battle, filling Dhananjaya with fear, had made the latter for such a long<br>period avoid a single combat with him,&#8212;alas, how could that hero be<br>slain in battle? How could he be slain by foes unless one of these had<br>happened to him viz., the destruction of his car, the snapping of his<br>bow, and the exhaustion of his weapons? Who could vanquish that tiger<br>among men, like a real tiger, endued with great impetuosity, Karna, while<br>shaking his formidable bow and shooting therefrom his terrible shafts and<br>celestial weapons in battle? Surely, his bow broke, or his car sank in<br>the earth, or his weapons became exhausted, since thou tellest me that he<br>is slain! I do not, indeed, see any other cause for (explaining) his<br>slaughter! That high-souled one who had made the terrible vow "I will not<br>wash my feet till I slay Phalguni," that warrior through whose fear that<br>bull among men, king Yudhishthira the just, had not, in the wilderness,<br>for thirteen years continuously, obtained a wink of sleep,&#8212;that<br>high-souled hero of great prowess relying upon whose valour my son had<br>forcibly dragged the wife of the Pandavas to the assembly, and there in<br>the midst of that conclave, in the very sight of the Pandavas and in the<br>presence of the Kurus, had addressed the princess of Pancala as the wife<br>of slaves, that hero of the Suta caste, who in the midst of the assembly<br>had addressed Krishna, saying, "All thy husbands, O Krishna, that are<br>even like sesamum seeds without kernel, are no more, therefore, seek some<br>other husband, O thou of the fairest complexion!" and in wrath had caused<br>her to listen to other expressions equally harsh and rude, how was that<br>hero slain by the foe? He who had said unto Duryodhana even these words,<br>viz., "If Bhishma who boasteth of his prowess in battle or Drona who is<br>invincible in fight, doth not, from partiality, slay the sons of Kunti, O<br>Duryodhana, even I will slay them all, let the fever of thy heart be<br>dispelled!" who also said, "What will (Arjuna's) gandiva and the two<br>inexhaustible quivers do to that shaft of mine, smeared with cool<br>sandal-paste, when it will course through the welkin?" alas, how could<br>that warrior possessed of shoulders broad as those of the bull be slain<br>by Arjuna? He who, disregarding the fierce touch of the arrows shot from<br>gandiva had addressed Krishna, saying, "Thou hast no husbands now" and<br>glared at the Pandavas, he who, O Sanjaya, relying on the might of his<br>own arms, had entertained no fear, for even a moment, of the Parthas with<br>their sons and Janardana,&#8212;he, I think, could not possibly meet with<br>death at the hands of the very gods with Vasava at their head rushing<br>against him in fury, what then need I say, O sire, of the Pandavas? The<br>person could not be seen competent to stay before the son of Adhiratha,<br>while the latter, putting on his fences, used to touch the bowstring! It<br>was possible for the Earth to be destitute of the splendour of the Sun,<br>of the Moon, or of fire, but the death of that foremost of men, who never<br>retreated from battle, could not be possible. That foolish child of mine,<br>of wicked understanding, who having got Karna, as also his brother<br>Duhshasana, for his ally, had made up his mind for the rejection of<br>Vasudeva's proposals, surely, that wight, beholding the slaughter of the<br>bull-shouldered Karna and of Duhshasana, is now indulging in<br>lamentations! Seeing Vikartana's son slain in single combat by Savyasaci,<br>and the Pandavas crowned with victory, what indeed, did Duryodhana say?<br>Seeing Durmarshana slain in battle and Vrishasena also, and seeing his<br>host break when slaughtered by mighty car-warriors, beholding also the<br>kings (of his army) turn back their faces, intent on flight, and his<br>car-warriors already fled, I think that son of mine is now indulging in<br>lamentations! Beholding his host dispirited, what, indeed, did the<br>ungovernable, proud, and foolish Duryodhana, with passions not under<br>control, say? Having himself provoked such fierce hostility though<br>dissuaded by all his friends what, indeed, did Duryodhana, who has<br>suffered a great loss in battle of friends and followers, say? Beholding<br>his brother slain in battle by Bhimasena, and upon his blood being drunk,<br>what indeed, did Duryodhana say? My son had, with the ruler of the<br>gandharvas, said, "Karna will slay Arjuna in battle!" When he saw that<br>Karna slain, what indeed, did he say? What, O sire, did Shakuni, the son<br>of Subala, who had formerly been filled with joy after going through the<br>match at dice and cheating the son of Pandu, say when he saw Karna slain?<br>What did that mighty car-warrior among the Satwatas, that great bowman,<br>Kritavarma the son of Hridika, say when he saw Vaikartana slain? Endued<br>with youth, possessed of a handsome form, agreeable to the sight, and<br>celebrated throughout the world, what, O Sanjaya, did Ashvatthama, the<br>intelligent son of Drona, upon whom brahmanas and kshatriyas and vaishyas<br>who are desirous of acquiring the science of arms wait, for protections,<br>say when he saw Karna slain? What did Sharadvata's son Kripa, O sire, of<br>Gotama's race, that foremost of car-warriors, that teacher of the science<br>of arms, say when he saw Karna slain? What did the mighty leader of the<br>Madras warriors, that king of the Madras, the great bowman Shalya of the<br>Sauvira clan, that ornament of assemblies, that foremost of car-warriors<br>(temporarily) engaged in driving the car, say when he saw Karna slain?<br>What also did all the other warriors, difficult of defeat in battle,<br>those lords of earth that came to fight, say, O Sanjaya, when they behold<br>Vaikartana slain? After the fall of the heroic Drona, that tiger among<br>car-warriors that bull among men, who, O Sanjaya, became the heads of the<br>several division in their order? Tell me, O Sanjaya, how that foremost of<br>car-warriors, Shalya the ruler of the Madras, became engaged in driving<br>the car of Vaikartana! Who were they that guarded the right wheel of the<br>Suta's son while the latter was engaged in fight, and who were they that<br>guarded his left wheel, and who were they that stood at the rear of that<br>hero? Who were those heroes that did not desert Karna, and who were those<br>mean fellows that ran away? How was the mighty car-warrior Karna slain<br>amidst your united selves? How also did those mighty car-warriors, the<br>brave Pandavas, advance against him shooting showers of shafts like the<br>clouds pouring torrents of rain? Tell me also, O Sanjaya, how that mighty<br>shaft, celestial and foremost of its species, and equipped with a head<br>like that of a serpent became futile! I do not, O Sanjaya, see the<br>possibility of even a small remnant of my cheerless host being saved when<br>its leaders have been crushed! Hearing of the slaughter of those two<br>heroes, those two mighty bowmen, Bhishma and Drona, who were ever ready<br>to lay down their lives for my sake, what use have I of life? Again and<br>again I am unable to endure that Karna, the might of whose arms equalled<br>that of 10,000 elephants, should be slain by the Pandavas! Tell me, O<br>Sanjaya, all that occurred in the battle between the brave warriors of<br>the Kauravas and their foes, after the death of Drona! Tell me also how<br>the sons of Kunti fought the battle with Karna, and how that slayer of<br>foes received his quietus in the fight!'"
