                            "Sanjaya said, 'The handsome Arjuna then, on that foremost car of his,<br>unto which were yoked white steeds, and which was urged by Narayana<br>himself, appeared on the scene. Like the tempest agitating the ocean,<br>Vijaya, O foremost of kings, in that battle, agitated that host of thine<br>teeming with horsemen. When the white-steeded Arjuna was otherwise<br>engaged, thy son Duryodhana, filled with rage and surrounded by half his<br>troops, approached suddenly, and encompassed the advancing Yudhishthira<br>inspired with the desire of revenge. The Kuru king then pierced the son<br>of Pandu with three and seventy razor-headed arrows. At this,<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, became inflamed with ire, and quickly<br>struck thy son with thirty broad-headed arrows. The Kaurava troops then<br>rushed impetuously for seizing Yudhishthira. Understanding the wicked<br>intentions of the enemy, the great car-warriors of the Pandava army,<br>uniting together, rushed towards Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, for<br>rescuing him. Indeed, Nakula and Sahadeva and Dhrishtadyumna, the son of<br>Prishata, surrounded by a full Akshauhini of troops, thus proceeded<br>towards Yudhishthira. Bhimasena also, in that battle, crushing the great<br>car-warriors of thy army, proceeded towards the king surrounded by foes.<br>Karna, otherwise called Vaikartana, O king, shooting dense showers of<br>arrows, checked, single-handed, all those mighty bowmen thus advancing<br>(to the rescue). Though they shot dense showers of arrows and hurled<br>innumerable lances, fighting with determination, yet they were unable<br>even to look at the son of Radha. Indeed, the son of Radha, that master<br>of all weapons offensive and defensive, by shooting dense showers of<br>shafts checked all those great bowmen. The high-souled Sahadeva, however,<br>quickly approaching (the spot where Duryodhana was), and invoking without<br>loss of time a (celestial) weapon, pierced Duryodhana with twenty arrows.<br>Thus pierced by Sahadeva, the Kuru king, covered with blood, looked<br>beautiful, like a huge elephant of split temples. Beholding thy son<br>deeply pierced with many arrows of great energy, that foremost of<br>car-warriors, viz., the son of Radha, filled with rage, rushed to that<br>spot. Seeing Duryodhana reduced to that plight, Karna, invoking his<br>weapons quickly, began to slaughter the troops of Yudhishthira and<br>Prishata's son. Thus slaughtered by the high-souled Karna, Yudhishthira's<br>troops, O king, afflicted with the arrows of the Suta's son, soon fled<br>away. Showers of shafts fell together. Indeed, those sped subsequently<br>from the bow of the Suta's son touched with their heads the wings of<br>those sped before. In consequence of those falling showers, of shafts, O<br>monarch, colliding with one another, a conflagration seemed to blaze<br>forth in the welkin. Soon Karna shrouded the ten points of the compass, O<br>king, with arrows capable of piercing the bodies of foes, as if with<br>advancing flights of locusts. Displaying the highest weapons, Karna began<br>to wave with great force his two arms smeared with red sandal-paste and<br>adorned with jewels and gold. Then stupefying all sides, O king, with his<br>shafts, Karna deeply afflicted Yudhishthira the just. Filled with rage at<br>this, Dharma's son Yudhishthira struck Karna with fifty keen shafts. In<br>consequence then of the darkness caused by those showers of arrows, the<br>battle became awful to look at. Loud cries of woe arose from among thy<br>troops, O monarch, whilst they were being slaughtered by Dharma's son, O<br>sire, with diverse kinds of keen shafts equipped with Kanka feathers and<br>whetted on stone, with numerous broad-headed arrows, and with diverse<br>kinds of darts and swords and clubs. Thither where Pandu's son of<br>virtuous soul cast his eyes with the desire of producing evil, thither<br>thy army broke, O bull of Bharata's race. Inflamed with great rage, Karna<br>also, of immeasurable soul, inspired with the desire of retaliating, his<br>face flushed in anger, rushed in that battle against Pandu's son, king<br>Yudhishthira the just, shooting cloth-yard shafts and crescent-shaped<br>arrows and those equipped with heads like the calf's tooth. Yudhishthira<br>also pierced him with many whetted arrows equipped with wings of gold. As<br>if smiling the while, Karna pierced the royal son of Pandu in the chest<br>with three broad-headed arrows, whetted on stone, and equipped with Kanka<br>feathers. Deeply afflicted therewith, king Yudhishthira the just, sitting<br>down on the terrace of his car, ordered his driver to retreat. Thereupon<br>all the Dhartarashtras, with their king, set up a loud shout, saying,<br>"Seize! Seize!" and all of them then pursued the (Pandava) king. Then<br>seventeen hundred Kekaya troops, skilled in smiting, united with a body<br>of the Pancala troops, O king, checked the Dhartarashtras. During the<br>progress of that fierce and terrible battle, Duryodhana and Bhima, those<br>two warriors endued with great might, encountered each other.'"
