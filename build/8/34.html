                            "'Duryodhana said, "After the fears of those throngs of the pitris, the<br>gods, and the Rishis had thus been dispelled by that high-souled Deity,<br>Brahman then offered his adorations, unto Sankara, and said these words<br>for the benefit of the universe, 'Through thy favour, O Lord of all, the<br>Lordship of all creatures is mine. Occupying that rank, I have given a<br>great boon to the Danavas. It behoveth none else, save thee, O Lord of<br>the Past and the Future, to destroy those wicked wights that show no<br>regard for any one. Thou O god, art the only person competent to slay the<br>foes of these denizens of heaven that have sought thy protection and that<br>solicit thee. O lord of all the gods, show favour to these. Slay the<br>Danavas, O wielder of the trident. O giver of honours, let the universe,<br>through thy grace, obtain happiness. O Lord of all the worlds, thou art<br>the one whose shelter should be sought. We all seek thy shelter.'<br><br>"'"Sthanu said, 'All your foes should be slain. But, I shall not however,<br>slay them single-handed. The enemies of the gods are possessed of might.<br>Therefore, all of you, united together, consume those enemies of yours in<br>battle, with half my might. Union is great strength.'<br><br>"'"The gods said, 'Theirs (Danavas') is twice the energy and might of<br>ourselves, we think, for we have already seen their energy and might.'<br><br>"'"The holy one said, 'Those sinful wights that have offended against ye<br>should be slain. With half of my energy and might, slay all those enemies<br>of yours.'<br><br>"'"The gods said, 'We will not be able, O Maheswara, to bear half of thy<br>energy. With, on the other hand, half of our united might, do thou slay<br>those foes.'<br><br>"'"The holy one said, 'If, indeed, ye have not the ability to bear half<br>of my might, then, endued with half of your united energy, I will slay<br>them.'<br><br>"'Duryodhana continued, "The celestials then, addressing the god of gods,<br>said 'So be it' O best of kings. Taking half of their energies from all<br>of them, he became superior in might. Indeed, in might that god became<br>superior to all in the universe. From that time Sankara came to be called<br>Mahadeva. And Mahadeva then said, 'Armed with bow and shaft, I will, from<br>my car, slay in battle those foes of yours, ye denizens of heaven.<br>Therefore, ye gods, see now to my car and bow and shaft so that I may,<br>this very day, throw the Asuras down on the Earth.'<br><br>"'"The gods said, 'Gathering all forms that may be found in the three<br>worlds and taking portions of each, we will each, O Lord of the gods,<br>construct a car of great energy for thee. It will be a large car, the<br>handiwork of Viswakarman, designed with intelligence.' Saying this, those<br>tigers among the gods began the construction of that car. And they made<br>Vishnu and Soma and Hutasana the arrow for Sankara's use. Agni became the<br>staff, and Soma became the head, and Vishnu the point, O king, of that<br>foremost of arrows. The goddess Earth, with her large cities and towns,<br>her mountains and forests and islands, that home of diverse creatures,<br>was made the car. The Mandara mountain was made its axle; and the great<br>river Ganga was made its Jangha; and the points of the compass, cardinal<br>and subsidiary became the ornaments of the car. The constellations became<br>its shaft; the Krita age became its yoke; and that best of Snakes, viz.,<br>Vasuki, became the Kuvara of that car. Himavat and Vindhya mountains<br>became its Apaskara and Adhishthana; and the Udaya and the Asta mountains<br>were made the wheels of that car by those foremost ones among the gods.<br>They made the excellent Ocean, that abode of the Danavas its other axle.<br>The seven Rishis became the protectors of the wheels of that car. Ganga<br>and Sarasvati and Sindhu and the Sky became its Dhura; all the other<br>rivers and all the waters became the chords for binding the several limbs<br>of that car. Day and Night and the other divisions of time such as Kalas<br>and Kasthas, and the Seasons became its Amukarsha. The blazing planets<br>and the stars became its wooden fence; Religion, Profit, and Pleasure,<br>united together, became its Trivenu. The herbs and the creepers, decked<br>with flowers and fruits, became its bells. Making the Sun and the Moon<br>equal, these were made the (other two) wheels of that foremost of cars.<br>Day and Night were made its auspicious wings on the right and left. The<br>ten foremost of snakes having Dhritarashtra for their first, all<br>exceedingly strong, formed the (other) shaft of that car. The Sky was<br>made its (other) yoke, and the clouds called Samvartaka and Valahaka were<br>the leathern strings of the yoke. The two Twilights and Dhritri and Medha<br>and Sthiti and Sannati, and the firmament bespangled with planets and<br>stars, were made the skins for covering that car. Those Regents of the<br>world, viz., the Lords of the gods, of the waters, of the dead, and of<br>treasures, were made the steeds of that car. Kalaprishtha, and Nahusha,<br>and Karkotaka, and Dhananjaya and the other snakes became the chords for<br>binding the manes of the steeds. The cardinal and the subsidiary<br>directions became the reins of the steeds of that car. The Vedic sound<br>Vashat became the goad, and Gayatri became the string attached to that<br>goad. The four auspicious days were made the traces of the steeds, and<br>the pitris presiding over them were made the hooks and pins. Action and<br>truth and ascetic penances and profit were made the chords of that car.<br>The Mind became the ground upon which that car stood, and Speech the<br>tracks upon which it was to proceed. Beautiful banners of various hues<br>waved in the air. With lightning and Indra's bow attached to it, that<br>blazing car gave fierce light. That space of time which, on a former<br>occasion, had, in the Sacrifice of the high-souled Ishana, been fixed as<br>a Year, became the bow, and the goddess Savitri became the loud-sounding<br>bow-string. A celestial coat of mail was made, decked with costly gems,<br>and impenetrable and effulgent, sprung from the wheel of Time. That<br>golden mountain, viz., the beautiful Meru, became the flagstaff, and the<br>clouds decked with flashes of lightning became its banners. Thus<br>equipped, that car shone brilliantly like a blazing fire in the midst of<br>the priests officiating at a sacrifice. Beholding that car properly<br>equipped, the gods became filled with wonder. Seeing the energies of the<br>entire universe united together in one place, O sire, the gods wondered,<br>and at last represented unto that illustrious Deity that the car was<br>ready. After, O monarch, that best of cars had thus been constructed by<br>the gods, O tiger among men, for grinding their foes, Sankara placed upon<br>it his own celestial weapons. Making the sky its flagstaff, he placed<br>upon it his bovine bull. The Brahmana's rod, the rod of Death, Rudra's<br>rod, and Fever became the protectors of the sides of that car and stood<br>with faces turned towards all sides. Atharvan and Angirasa became the<br>protectors of the car-wheels of that illustrious warrior. The Rigveda,<br>the Samaveda, and the Puranas stood in advance of that car. The histories<br>and the Yajurveda became the protectors of the rear. All sacred Speeches<br>and all the Sciences stood around it, and all hymns, O monarch, and the<br>Vedic sound of Vashat also. And the syllable Om, O king, standing in the<br>van of that car, made it exceedingly beautiful. Having made the Year<br>adorned with the six seasons his bow, he made his own shadow the<br>irrefragable string of that bow in that battle. The illustrious Rudra is<br>Death's self. The Year became his bow; Kala Ratri the Death-night<br>therefore, which is Rudra's shadow, became the indestructible string of<br>that bow. Vishnu and Agni and Soma became (as already said) the arrow.<br>The universe is said to consist of Agni and Soma. The universe is<br>similarly said to consist of Vishnu. Vishnu is, again, the Soul of the<br>holy Bhava of immeasurable energy. For this the touch of that bow-string<br>became unbearable to the Asuras. And the lord Sankara cast on that arrow<br>his own irresistible and fierce wrath, the unbearable fire of anger,<br>viz., that which was born of wrath of Bhrigu and Angirasa. Then He called<br>Nila Rohita (Blue and Red or smoke)&#8212;that terrible deity robed in<br>skins,&#8212;looking like 10,000 Suns, and shrouded by the fire of<br>superabundant Energy, blazed up with splendour. That discomfiter of even<br>him that is difficult of being discomfited, that victor, that slayer of<br>all haters of Brahma, called also Hara, that rescuer of the righteous and<br>destroyer of the unrighteous, viz., the illustrious Sthanu, accompanied<br>by many beings of terrible might and terrible forms that were endued with<br>the speed of the mind and capable of agitating and crushing all foes, as<br>if with all the fourteen faculties of the soul awake about him, looked<br>exceedingly resplendent. Having his limbs for their refuge, this entire<br>universe of mobile and immobile creatures that were present there, O<br>king, looked beautiful, presenting a highly wonderful appearance.<br>Beholding that car, duly equipped, he cased himself in mail and armed<br>himself with the bow, and took up that celestial shaft born of Soma and<br>Vishnu and Agni. The gods, O king, then commanded that foremost of<br>celestials, viz., Wind, to breathe after that puissant Deity all the<br>fragrance that he carries. Then Mahadeva, terrifying the very gods, and<br>making the very Earth tremble, ascended that car resolutely. Then the<br>great Rishis, the Gandharvas, those throngs of gods and those diverse<br>tribes of Apsaras began to praise that Lord of the gods while he was<br>about to ascend that car. Adored by the regenerate Rishis, and praised by<br>the eulogists and diverse tribes of dancing Apsaras well-versed in the<br>art of dancing, that boon-giving lord, armed with scimitar and arrow and<br>bow, looked very beautiful. Smiling, he then asked the gods, 'Who will<br>become my driver?' The gods answered him, saying, 'He whom thou wilt<br>appoint, will, O Lord of the gods, without doubt, become thy driver!'<br>Unto them the god replied, 'Reflecting yourselves, without delay make him<br>my driver who is superior to me!' Hearing these words uttered by that<br>high-souled Deity, the gods repaired unto the Grandsire and inclining him<br>to grace, said these words, 'We have accomplished everything, O holy one,<br>that thou hadst ordered us to do in the matter of afflicting the foes of<br>celestials. The Deity having the bull for his mark has been gratified<br>with us. A car hath been constructed by us, equipped with many wonderful<br>weapons. We do not, however, know who is to become the driver of that<br>foremost of cars. Therefore, let some foremost one among the gods be<br>appointed as the driver. O holy one, it behoveth thee to make true those<br>words that thou, O lord, hadst then said to us. Before this, O god, thou<br>hadst even said to us that thou wouldst do us good. It behoveth thee to<br>accomplish that promise. That irresistible and best of cars, that router<br>of our foes, hath been constructed out of the component parts of the<br>celestials. The Deity armed with Pinaka hath been made the warrior who is<br>to stand on it. Striking the Danavas with fear, he is prepared for<br>battle. The four Vedas have become the four foremost of steeds. With her<br>mountains, the Earth has become the car of that high-souled one. The<br>stars have become the adornments of that vehicle. (As already said) Hara<br>is the warrior. We do not, however, see who is to become the driver. A<br>driver should be sought for that car who is superior to all these. Equal<br>to thee in importance is that car, O god, and Hara is the warrior.<br>Armour, and weapons, and bow, these we have got already, O Grandsire.<br>Except thee, we do not behold any person that can make its driver. Thou<br>art endued with every accomplishment. Thou, O lord, art superior to all<br>the gods. Mounting upon that car with speed, hold the reins of those<br>foremost of steeds, for the victory of the celestials and the destruction<br>of their foes.' It has been heard by us that bowing with their heads unto<br>the Grandsire that Lord of the three worlds, the gods sought to gratify<br>him for inducing him to accept the drivership.<br><br>"'"The Grandsire said, 'There is nothing of untruth in all this that ye<br>have said, ye denizens of heaven. I will hold the reins of the steeds for<br>Kapaddin while he will be engaged in fight.' Then that illustrious god,<br>that Creator of the worlds, the Grandsire, was appointed by the gods as<br>the driver of the high-souled Ishana. And when he was about to ascend<br>quickly upon that car worshipped by all, those steeds, endued with the<br>speed of the wind, bowed themselves with their heads to the Earth. Having<br>ascended the car the illustrious Deity, viz., the Grandsire resplendent<br>with his own energy, took the reins and the goad. Then the illustrious<br>god, raising those steeds addressed that foremost one among the gods,<br>viz., Sthanu, saying, 'Ascend.' Then, taking that arrow composed of<br>Vishnu and Soma and Agni, Sthanu ascended the car, causing the foe to<br>tremble by means of his bow. The great Rishis, the Gandharvas, the<br>throngs of gods, and the diverse tribes of Apsaras, then praised that<br>Lord of the gods after he had ascended the car. Resplendent with beauty,<br>the boon-giving Lord, armed with scimitar, shaft, and bow, stayed on the<br>car causing the three worlds to blaze forth with his own energy. The<br>great Deity once more said unto the gods headed by Indra, 'Ye should<br>never grieve, doubting my ability to destroy the Asura. Know that the<br>Asuras have already been slain by means of this arrow'. The gods then<br>answered, saying, 'It is true! The Asuras have already been slain.'<br>Indeed, the gods thinking that the words which the divine Lord had said<br>could not be untrue, became exceedingly gratified. Then that Lord of the<br>gods proceeded surrounded by all the gods, upon that large car, O king,<br>which had nothing to compare with it. And the illustrious Deity was<br>adored, all the while by the attendants that always wait upon him, and by<br>others that subsisted on meat, that were invincible in battle, and that<br>danced in joy on the present occasion, running wildly on all sides and<br>shouting at one another, Rishis also, of great good fortune, possessed of<br>ascetic merit and endued with high qualities, as also the gods, wished<br>for Mahadeva's success. When that boon-giving Lord, that dispeller of the<br>fears of the three worlds, thus proceeded, the entire universe, all the<br>gods, O best of men, became exceedingly gratified. And the Rishis there<br>adored the Lord of the gods with diverse hymns, and enhancing his energy,<br>O king, took up their station there. And millions upon millions of<br>Gandharvas played upon diverse kinds of musical instruments at the hour<br>of his setting out. When the boon-giving Brahman, having ascended the<br>car, set out for the Asuras, the Lord of the Universe, smiling the while,<br>said, 'Excellent, Excellent! Proceed, O god, to the spot where the<br>Daityas are. Urge the steeds wakefully. Behold today the might of arms<br>while I slay the foe in battle.' Thus addressed, Brahman urged those<br>steeds endued with the fleetness of the wind or thought towards that spot<br>where the triple city, O king, stood, protected by the Daityas and the<br>Danavas. With those steeds worshipped by all the worlds, and which<br>coursed with such speed that they seemed to devour the skies, the<br>illustrious god quickly proceeded for the victory of the denizens of<br>heaven. Indeed, when Bhava, riding on the car, set out towards the triple<br>city, his bull uttered tremendous roars, filling all the points of the<br>compass. Hearing that loud and terrible roar of the bull, many of the<br>descendants and followers of Taraka, those enemies of the gods, breathed<br>their last. Others amongst them stood facing the foe for battle. Then<br>Sthanu, O king, armed with trident became deprived of his senses in<br>wrath. All creatures became frightened, and the three worlds began to<br>tremble. Frightful portents appeared when he was on the point of aiming<br>that shaft. In consequence, however, of the pressure caused by the weight<br>of Soma, Agni, and Vishnu that were in that shaft, as also of the<br>pressure caused by the weight of Brahman and Rudra and the latter's bow,<br>that car seemed to sink. Then Narayana, issuing out of the point of that<br>shaft, assumed the form of a bull and raised that large car. During the<br>time the car had sunk and the foe had began to roar, the illustrious<br>Deity, endued with great might began, from rage, to utter loud shouts,<br>standing, O giver of honours, on the head of his bull and the back of his<br>steeds. At that time the illustrious Rudra was employed in eyeing the<br>Danava city. While in that posture, O best of men, Rudra cut off the<br>teats of the horses and clove the hoofs of the bull. Blessed be thou,<br>from the date the hoofs of all animals of the bovine species came to be<br>cloven. And from that time, O king, horses, afflicted by the mighty Rudra<br>of wonderful deeds, came to be without teats. Then Sarva, having stringed<br>his bow and aimed that shaft with which he had united the Pasupata<br>weapon, waited thinking of the triple city. And O king, as Rudra thus<br>stood, holding his bow, the three cities during that time became united.<br>When the three cities, losing their separate characters became united,<br>tumultuous became the joy of the high-souled gods. Then all the gods, the<br>Siddhas, and the great Rishis, uttered the word Jaya, adoring Maheshwara.<br>The triple city then appeared immediately before that god of unbearable<br>energy, that Deity of fierce and indescribable form, that warrior who was<br>desirous of slaying the Asuras. The illustrious deity, that Lord of the<br>universe, then drawing that celestial bow, sped that shaft which<br>represented the might of the whole universe, at the triple city. Upon<br>that foremost of shafts, O thou of great good fortune, being shot, loud<br>wails of woe were heard from those cities as they began to fall down<br>towards the Earth. Burning those Asuras, he threw them down into the<br>Western ocean. Thus was the triple city burnt and thus were the Danavas<br>exterminated by Maheswara in wrath, from desire of doing good to the<br>three worlds. The fire born of his own wrath, the three-eyed god<br>quenched, saying, 'Do not reduce the three worlds to ashes.' After this,<br>the gods, the Rishis, and the three worlds became all restored to their<br>natural dispositions, and gratified Sthanu of unrivalled energy with<br>words of high import. Receiving then the permission of the great god, the<br>gods with the Creator at their head went away to the places they came<br>from, their object being accomplished after such effort. Thus that<br>illustrious Deity, that Creator of the worlds, that Lord of both the Gods<br>and the Asuras, viz., Maheswara, did that which was for the good of all<br>the worlds. As the illustrious Brahman, the Creator of the worlds, the<br>Grandsire, the Supreme Deity of unfading glory, acted as the driver of<br>Rudra, so do thou restrain the steeds of the high-souled son of Radha<br>like Grandsire restraining those of Rudra. There is not the slightest<br>doubt, O tiger among kings, that thou art superior to Krishna, to Karna,<br>and to Phalguna. In battle, Karna is like Rudra, and thou art like<br>Brahman in policy. United, ye two, therefore, are competent to vanquish<br>my foes that are even like the Asuras. Let, O Shalya, that be done<br>speedily today by which this Karna, grinding the Pandava troops, may be<br>able to slay Kunti's son owning white steeds and having Krishna for the<br>driver of his car. Upon thee depend Karna, ourselves, our kingdom, and<br>(our) victory in battle. Hold the reins, therefore, of the excellent<br>steeds (of Karna). There is another story which I will narrate. Listen<br>once more to it. A virtuous brahmana had recited it in the presence of my<br>father. Hearing these delightful words fraught with the reasons and<br>purposes of acts, do, O Shalya, what thou mayst settle, without<br>entertaining any scruples. In the race of the Bhrigus was Jamadagni of<br>severe ascetic penances. He had a son endued with energy and every<br>virtue, who became celebrated by the name of Rama. Practising the<br>austerest penances, of cheerful soul, bound to observances and vows, and<br>keeping his senses under control, he gratified the god Bhava for<br>obtaining weapons. In consequence of his devotion and tranquillity of<br>heart. Mahadeva became gratified with him. Sankara, understanding the<br>desire cherished in his heart, showed himself unto Rama. And Mahadeva<br>said, 'O Rama, I am gratified with thee. Blessed be thou, thy desire is<br>known to me. Make thy soul pure. Thou wilt then have all that thou<br>desirest. I will give thee all weapons when thou wilt become pure. Those<br>weapons, O son, of Bhrigu, burn a person that is incompetent and that is<br>not deserving of them.' Thus addressed by that god of gods, that deity<br>bearing the trident, the son of Jamadagni, bending his head unto that<br>puissant high-souled one, said, 'O god of gods, it behoveth thee to give<br>those weapons unto me that am always devoted to thy service, when, indeed<br>thou wilt regard me fit for holding them.'"<br><br>"'Duryodhana continued. "With penances then, and restraining his senses,<br>and observances of vows, and worship and offerings and with sacrifices<br>and Homa performed with mantras, Rama adored Sarva for many long years.<br>At last Mahadeva, pleased with the high-souled son of Bhrigu's race,<br>described him, in the presence of his divine spouse, as possessed of many<br>virtues: 'This Rama, of firm vows is ever devoted to me.' Gratified with<br>him, the Lord Sankara thus repeatedly proclaimed his virtues in the<br>presence of gods and the Rishis, O slayer of foes. Meanwhile, the Daityas<br>became very mighty. Blinded by pride and folly, they afflicted the<br>denizens of heaven. The gods then, uniting together, and firmly resolved<br>to slay them, strove earnestly for the destruction of those foes. They,<br>however, failed to vanquish them. The gods then, repairing to Maheswara,<br>the Lord of Uma, began to gratify him with devotion, saying, 'Slay our<br>foes.' That god, having promised the destruction of their foes unto the<br>celestials, summoned Rama the descendant of Bhrigu. And Sankara addressed<br>Rama, saying, 'O descendant of Bhrigu, slay all the assembled foes of the<br>gods, from desire of doing good unto all the worlds as also for my<br>satisfaction.' Thus addressed, Rama replied unto that boon-giving Lord of<br>Three-eyes, saying, 'What strength have I, O chief of the gods destitute<br>as I am of weapons, to slay in battle the assembled Danavas that are<br>accomplished in weapons and invincible in fight? Maheswara said, 'Go thou<br>at my command. Thou shalt slay those foes. Having vanquished all those<br>enemies, thou shalt acquire numerous merits.' Hearing these words and<br>accepting them all, Rama, causing propitiatory rites to be performed for<br>his success, proceeded against the Danavas. Addressing those enemies of<br>the gods that were endued with might and possessed with folly and pride,<br>he said, 'Ye Daityas that are fierce in battle, give me battle. I have<br>been sent by the God of gods to vanquish you.' Thus addressed by the<br>descendant of Bhrigu, the Daityas began to fight. The delighter of the<br>Bhargavas, however, slaying the Daityas in battle, with strokes whose<br>touch resembled that of Indra's thunder, came back to Mahadeva.<br>Jamadagni's son, that foremost of brahmanas returned with many wounds on<br>his person inflicted by the Danavas. Touched, however by Sthanu, his<br>wounds were immediately healed. Gratified also with that feat of his, the<br>illustrious god gave diverse kinds of boons unto the high-souled son of<br>Bhrigu. With satisfaction in his heart, the trident-wielding God of gods<br>said, 'The pain thou hast suffered in consequence of the fall of weapons<br>upon thy body evidences the super-human feat that thou hast achieved, O<br>delighter of the Bhrigus. As desired by thee, accept from me these<br>celestial weapons.'"<br><br>"'Duryodhana continued, "Having obtained all the celestial weapons and<br>the boons that had been desired by him, Rama bowed unto Siva with his<br>head. Obtaining the leave also of the gods that great ascetic went away.<br>This is the old story that the rishi had recited. The descendant of<br>Bhrigu gave the whole science of weapons unto the high-souled Karna, O<br>tiger among kings with delighted heart. If Karna had any fault, O lord of<br>Earth, the delighter of Bhrigu's race would never have given him his<br>celestial weapons. I do not think that Karna could have been born in the<br>Suta order. I think him to be the son of a god, born in the kshatriya<br>order. I think that he was abandoned (in infancy) in order that the race<br>in which he was born might be ascertained (by his features and feats). By<br>no means, O Shalya, could this Karna have been born in the Suta order.<br>With his (natural) earring and (natural) coat of mail, this mighty<br>car-warrior of long arms, resembling Surya himself, could not be borne by<br>a common woman even as a she-deer can never bear a tiger. His arms are<br>massive, each resembling the trunk of a prince of elephants. Behold his<br>chest that is so broad and capable of resisting every foe. Karna<br>otherwise called Vaikartana, O king, cannot be an ordinary person. Endued<br>with great valour, this disciple of Rama, O king of kings, is a<br>high-souled personage.'"
