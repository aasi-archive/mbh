                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then occurred that battle between Arjuna and Ashvatthama<br>resembling the planets Shukra and Brihaspati in splendour, like the<br>battle between Shukra and Brihaspati in the firmament for entering the<br>same constellation. Afflicting each other with blazing shafts that<br>constituted their rays, those terrifiers of the world stood like two<br>planets both deviating from their orbits. Then Arjuna deeply pierced<br>Ashvatthama with a shaft in the midst of his eyebrows. With that shaft<br>the son of Drona looked resplendent like the Sun with upward rays. The<br>two Krishnas (Nara and Narayana), also deeply afflicted by Ashvatthama<br>with hundreds of arrows, looked like two Suns at the end of the Yuga,<br>resplendent with their own rays. Then when Vasudeva seemed to be<br>stupefied, Arjuna shot a weapon from which issued torrents of shafts on<br>all sides. And he struck the son of Drona with innumerable shafts, each<br>resembling the thunder or fire or the sceptre of Death. Endued with<br>mighty energy, that achiever of fierce feats, (Ashvatthama) then pierced<br>both Keshava and Arjuna with well-shot shafts which were inspired with<br>great impetuosity and struck with which Death himself would feel pain.<br>Checking the shafts of Drona's son, Arjuna covered him with twice as many<br>arrows equipped with goodly wings, and shrouding that foremost of heroes<br>and his steeds and driver and standard, began to strike the samsaptakas.<br>With his well-shot shafts Partha began to cut off the bows and quivers<br>and bowstrings and hands and arms and tightly grasped weapons and<br>umbrellas and standards and steeds and car shafts and robes and floral<br>garlands and ornaments and coats of mail and handsome shields and<br>beautiful heads, in large numbers, of his unretreating foes.<br>Well-equipped cars and steeds and elephants, ridden by heroes fighting<br>with great care, were destroyed by the hundreds of shafts sped by Partha<br>and fell down along with the heroes that rode on them. Cut off with<br>broad-headed and crescent-shaped and razor-faced arrows, human heads,<br>resembling the lotus, the Sun, or the full Moon in beauty and resplendent<br>with diadems and necklaces and crowns, dropped ceaselessly on the earth.<br>Then the Kalinga, the Vanga, and the Nishada heroes, riding on elephants,<br>that resembled in splendour the elephant of the great foe of the daityas,<br>rushed with speed against the queller of the pride of the danavas, the<br>son of Pandu, from desire of slaying him. Partha cut off the vital limbs,<br>the trunks, the riders, the standards, and the banners of those<br>elephants, upon which those beasts fell down like mountain summits riven<br>with thunder. When that elephant force was broken, the diadem-decked<br>Arjuna shrouded the son of his preceptor with shafts endued with the<br>splendour of the newly risen Sun, like the wind shrouding the risen Sun<br>with masses of congregated clouds. Checking with his own shafts those of<br>Arjuna, Drona's son shrouding both Arjuna and Vasudeva with his arrows,<br>gave a loud roar, like a mass of clouds at the close of summer after<br>shrouding the Sun or the Moon in the firmament. Deeply afflicted with<br>those arrows, Arjuna, aiming his weapons at Ashvatthama and at those<br>followers of his belonging to the army, speedily dispelled that darkness<br>caused by Ashvatthama's arrows, and pierced all of them with shafts<br>equipped with goodly wings. In that battle none could see when Savyasaci<br>took up his shafts, when he aimed them, and when he let them off. All<br>that could be seen was that elephants and steeds and foot-soldiers and<br>car-warriors, struck with his arrows, fell down deprived of life. Then<br>Drona's son without losing a moment, aiming ten foremost of arrows, sped<br>them quickly as if they formed only one arrow. Shot with great force,<br>five of these pierced Arjuna and the other five pierced Vasudeva. Struck<br>with those arrows, those two foremost of men, like Kuvera and Indra,<br>became bathed in blood. Thus afflicted, all the people there regarded<br>those two heroes as slain by Ashvatthama the warrior who had completely<br>mastered the science of arms. Then the chief of the Dasharhas addressed<br>Arjuna and said, "Why errest thou in thus sparing Ashvatthama? Slay this<br>warrior. If treated with indifference, even this one will be the cause of<br>great woe, like a disease not sought to be put down by treatment."<br>Replying unto Keshava of unfading glory with the words "So be it!" Arjuna<br>of unclouded understanding began with good care to mangle the son of<br>Drona with his shafts. Now the son of Pandu, filled with rage, quickly<br>pierced the massive arms, smeared with sandal-paste, and the chest, the<br>head, and the unrivalled thighs of his antagonist with shafts equipped<br>with heads like goats' ears, and shot with great force from gandiva. Then<br>cutting off the traces of Ashvatthama's steeds, Arjuna began to pierce<br>the steeds themselves, whereat the latter bore Ashvatthama away to a<br>great distance from the field. Thus borne away by these steeds endued<br>with the speed of the wind, the intelligent son of Drona, deeply<br>afflicted with the shafts of Partha, reflecting for some time, wished not<br>to go back and renew the fight with Partha. Knowing that victory is ever<br>with the chief of the Vrishnis and with Dhananjaya, that foremost one of<br>Angirasa's race, endued with great activity, entered the army of Karna,<br>deprived of hope and with shafts and weapons almost exhausted. Indeed,<br>Drona's son, restraining his steeds, and having comforted himself a<br>little, O sire, entered the force of Karna, teeming with cars and steeds<br>and men. After Ashvatthama, that enemy of theirs, had been thus removed<br>from the field by his steeds like a disease removed from the body by<br>incantations and medicines and means, Keshava and Arjuna proceeded<br>towards the samsaptakas, on their car whose rattle resembled the roar of<br>the clouds and whose banner waved on the wind.'"
