                            Sanjaya said, "Then when the blare of conchs and the peal of drums became<br>very loud, those two foremost of men, both owning white steeds, the<br>suta's son Vikartana and Arjuna, encountered each other in consequence, O<br>king, of thy son's evil policy. Those two heroes endued with great<br>impetuosity, Dhananjaya and Adhiratha's son, closed with each other like<br>two infuriated Himalayan elephants, both of full-grown tusks, fighting<br>with each other for the sake of a she-elephant in her season. Like a mass<br>of clouds encountering another mass, or a mountain encountering a<br>mountain, those two warriors, both pouring showers of arrows, encountered<br>each other, their bows loudly twanging the while, and the wheels of their<br>cars producing a deafening clatter, and their bow-strings and palms<br>emitting loud sounds. Like two mountains, both endued with tall cliffs<br>and abounding in trees and creepers and herbs and both teeming with the<br>diverse other denizens that are natural to them, moving towards each<br>other for an encounter, those two mighty warriors encountered each other,<br>each striking the other with mighty weapons.<br><br>The combat between the two heroes became furious like that between the<br>chief of the celestials and Virocana's son in days of yore. Incapable of<br>being endured by others and marked by a river whose distasteful water<br>consisted of blood, the limbs of those two heroes, as also their drivers<br>and animals, became exceedingly mangled. Like two large lakes, both<br>teeming with lotuses of diverse kinds and fish and tortoises, and echoing<br>with the voices of diverse kinds of fowl, and softly stirred by the wind,<br>approaching each other, those two cars graced with standards approached<br>each other. Both endued with prowess equal to that of the great Indra,<br>both resembling the great Indra himself, those two mighty car-warriors<br>struck each other with shafts that resembled the great Indra's thunder,<br>like the great Indra himself and (the asura) Vritra.<br><br>Both the armies consisting of cars and elephants and steeds and<br>foot-soldiers, all equipped with beautiful armour and ornaments and robes<br>and weapons, and those also that were in the welkin, were inspired with<br>fear upon beholding that encounter of wonderful aspect between Arjuna and<br>Karna. Others among the spectators, filled with joy and uttering leonine<br>shouts, raised their arms, waving their fingers or the pieces of cloth<br>they held, when Arjuna rushed against the son of Adhiratha, from desire<br>of slaughter, like one infuriated elephant rushing against another.<br><br>The Somakas then loudly shouted to Partha, saying, "Be quick, O Arjuna,<br>go and pierce Karna. Cut off his head without delay, and (with it) the<br>desire of Dhritarashtra's son for kingdom." Similarly many warriors of<br>ours that were there, said unto Karna, "Proceed, proceed, O Karna, and<br>slay Arjuna with keen shafts. Let the sons of Pritha once more go to the<br>woods forever."<br><br>Then Karna first pierced Partha in that encounter, with ten mighty<br>shafts. Arjuna pierced him in return with ten keen-pointed shafts, shot<br>with great vigour, in the centre of the chest. Indeed, the suta's son and<br>Arjuna then mangled each other with many shafts equipped with goodly<br>wings. Desirous of obtaining advantage of each other's lapses in that<br>dreadful encounter, with cheerful hearts they rushed against each other<br>fiercely.<br><br>Rubbing his two arms and the string also of gandiva, that fierce bowman,<br>Arjuna, then sped showers of cloth-yard shafts, and nalikas and arrows<br>equipped with heads like boar's ears and razors, and anjalikas, and<br>crescent-shaped arrows. Those arrows of Partha, O king, spread over the<br>welkin, penetrated into Karna's car like flights of birds, with heads<br>bent down, penetrating in the evening into a tree for roosting there in<br>the night. All those arrows, however, O king, that Arjuna, that victor<br>over all foes, with furrowed brow and angry glances, sped at Karna, all<br>those successive showers of shafts shot by the son of Pandu, were cut off<br>by the suta's son with his own arrows.<br><br>The son of Indra then sped at Karna a fiery weapon capable of slaying all<br>foes. Covering the earth and the welkin and the ten points of the compass<br>and the very course of the sun with its effulgence, it caused his own<br>body also to blaze up with light. The robes of all the warriors took<br>fire, at which they fled away. Loud sounds also arose there, like what is<br>heard when a forest of bamboos in a wilderness is on fire. Beholding that<br>fiery weapon acting on all sides, the suta's son Karna of great valour<br>shot in that encounter the varunastra for quenching it. That<br>conflagration then, in consequence of Karna's weapon, became quenched.<br><br>A large mass of clouds quickly caused all the points of the compass to be<br>enveloped with darkness. Those clouds whose extremities presented the<br>aspect of mountains, surrounding every side, flooded the earth with<br>water. That fierce conflagration, though it was such, was still quenched<br>by those clouds in a trice. The entire welkin and all the directions,<br>cardinal and subsidiary, were shrouded by clouds. Thus shrouded by<br>clouds, all the points of the compass became dark and nothing could be<br>seen.<br><br>Then Arjuna dispelled those clouds caused by Karna, by means of the<br>vayavyastra. After this, Dhananjaya, incapable of being over-mastered by<br>foes inspired gandiva, its string, and his shafts, with mantras, and<br>invoked into existence another weapon that was the favourite of the chief<br>of the celestials and that resembled the thunder in energy and prowess.<br>Then razor-headed arrows, and anjalikas, and crescent-shaped shafts, and<br>nalikas, and cloth-yard shafts and those equipped with heads like the<br>boar's ear, all keen and sharp, issued from gandiva in thousands, endued<br>with the force and impetuosity of the thunder. Possessed of great might<br>and great energy, those impetuous and keen shafts equipped with vulturine<br>feathers piercing all the limbs, the steeds, the bow, the yoke, the<br>wheels, and the standard of Karna, quickly penetrated into them like<br>snakes frightened by Garuda penetrating into the earth. Pierced all over<br>with arrows and bathed in blood, (the high-souled) Karna then, with eyes<br>rolling in wrath, bending his bow of enduring string and producing a<br>twang as loud as the roar of the sea, invoked into existence the Bhargava<br>weapon. Cutting off Partha's showers of shafts proceeding from the mouth<br>of that weapon of Indra (which Arjuna had shot), Karna, having thus<br>baffled his antagonist's weapon with his own, destroyed cars and<br>elephants and foot-soldiers (of the Pandava army). Unable to endure the<br>feats of Arjuna in that fierce battle, the mighty car-warrior Karna did<br>this, through the energy of the Bhargava weapon. Filled with wrath and<br>possessed of great activity, the Suta's son, that foremost of men,<br>laughing at the two Krishnas, pierced the foremost of Pancala warriors<br>with well shot arrows in that battle. Then the Pancalas and the Somakas,<br>O king, thus afflicted by Karna with showers of shafts in that encounter,<br>became filled with wrath and uniting together pierced the Suta's son with<br>keen arrows from every side. Quickly cutting off those arrows with his<br>own, the Suta's son, vigorously agitating them in that battle, afflicted<br>with many shafts the cars, the elephants, and the steeds of the Pancalas.<br>Their bodies pierced with those shafts of Karna, they fell down, deprived<br>of life, on the earth, making loud sounds, like mighty elephants slain by<br>an angry lion of terrible strength. Having slain those foremost of<br>warriors, those heroes endued with great strength, those leaders of the<br>Pancala forces who had always challenged him (to battle), Karna, O king,<br>as he shot his arrows, looked beautiful, like a mass of clouds pouring<br>torrents of rain. Then thy warriors, thinking that Karna had won the<br>victory, clapped loudly and uttered leonine roars. O chief of the Kurus,<br>all of them then regarded the two Krishnas as brought by Karna under his<br>power, seeing that valour, incapable of being borne by foes, of the<br>mighty car-warrior Karna. Beholding that weapon of Dhananjaya frustrated<br>by Karna in the midst of battle, the angry son of the Wind-god, with eyes<br>blazing with wrath, began to squeeze his hands. Indeed, the wrathful<br>Bhima, his anger being provoked, drew deep breaths and addressing Arjuna<br>of true aim, said, "How, O Jishnu, could this wretch fallen off from<br>virtue, this Suta's son, putting forth his might in battle, slay so many<br>foremost of Pancala warriors, in thy sight? Before now thou couldst not<br>be conquered by the very gods or the Kalakeyas. Thou receivedst the touch<br>of the arms of Sthanu himself. How, then, O diadem-decked Arjuna, could<br>the Suta's son pierce thee first with ten long shafts such as are used by<br>car-warriors? That the Suta's son should today have succeeded in baffling<br>the arrows shot by thee seems to me to be very amazing. Recollect the<br>woes of Krishna, and those disagreeable, keen, and cutting words that<br>this wicked-souled and fearless son of a Suta used towards us, viz.,<br>'Sesame seeds without kernel!' Recollecting all this, O Savyasaci,<br>quickly slay the wretched Karna in battle today. Why, O diadem-decked<br>Arjuna, dost thou show such indifference (towards this act)? This is not<br>the time for showing thy indifference to Karna's slaughter. That patience<br>with which thou didst vanquish all creatures and feed Agni at Khandava,<br>with that patience, slay thou the Suta's son. I also will crush him with<br>my mace." Then Vasudeva, beholding Partha's shafts baffled by Karna, said<br>unto the former, "What is this, O diadem-decked Arjuna, that Karna should<br>succeed in crushing thy weapons today with this? Why dost, thou, O hero,<br>lose thy wits? Markest thou not that the Kauravas, (standing behind<br>Karna), are even now shouting in joy? Indeed, all of them know that thy<br>weapons are being baffled by Karna with his. That patience with which,<br>Yuga after Yuga, thou hadst slain persons having the quality of darkness<br>for their weapons, as also terrible Kshatriyas, and Asuras born of pride,<br>in many a battle&#8212;with that patience do thou slay Karna today. Putting<br>forth thy might, strike off the head of that foe of thine with this<br>Sudarsana, of edge keen as a razor, that I give unto thee, like Sakra<br>striking off the head of his foe Namuci, with the thunderbolt. That<br>patience with which thou didst gratified the illustrious deity Mahadeva<br>in the guise of a hunter, summoning that patience once again, O hero,<br>slay the Suta's son with all his followers. After that, bestow upon king<br>Yudhishthira the earth with her belt of seas, her towns and villages, and<br>wealth, and from off whose surface all foes will have been removed. By<br>that act, O Partha, do thou also win unrivalled fame." Thus addressed (by<br>Krishna), the high-souled Partha of exceeding might set his heart upon<br>the slaughter of the Suta's son. Indeed, urged by Bhima and Janardana,<br>and recollecting (his woes), and taking an internal survey of himself,<br>and calling to mind the object for which he had come to this world, he<br>addressed Keshava, saying, "I will now invoke into existence a mighty and<br>fierce weapon for the good of the world and the destruction of the Suta's<br>son. Let me have thy permission, as also Brahman's and Bhava's, and of<br>all those that are conversant with Brahma." Having said these words unto<br>the holy Keshava, Savyasaci of immeasurable soul bowed unto Brahman and<br>invoked into existence that excellent irresistible weapon called<br>brahmastra which could be applied by the mind alone. Baffling that<br>weapon, however, Karna looked beautiful as he continued, like a cloud<br>pouring torrents of rain, to shoot his shafts. Beholding that weapon of<br>the diadem-decked Arjuna baffled in the midst of battle by Karna, the<br>wrathful and mighty Bhima, blazing up with rage, addressed Arjuna of sure<br>aim and said, "People say that thou art a master of the high brahmastra,<br>that mighty means (for achieving the destruction of foes). Do thou then,<br>O Savyasaci, use another weapon of the same kind." Thus addressed by his<br>brother, Savyasaci used a second weapon of the kind. With that, Partha of<br>abundant energy shrouded all the points of the compass, cardinal and<br>subsidiary, with arrows sped from gandiva that resembled fierce snakes<br>and were like the blazing rays of the sun. Created by that bull of<br>Bharata's race, those arrows of golden wings, in hundreds upon hundreds,<br>endued with the effulgence of the yuga fire or the sun, in a moment<br>shrouded the car of Karna. Thence also issued long darts and battle-axes<br>and discs and cloth-yard shafts in hundreds, all of awful forms, at which<br>hostile warriors all around began to be deprived of life. The head of<br>some hostile warrior, severed from his trunk, fell down on the field of<br>battle. Another, beholding his fallen comrade, fell down dead on the<br>earth, through fear. The (right) arm of a third, large and massive as the<br>trunk of an elephant, cut off (by Partha), fell down with the sword in<br>grasp. The left arm of a fourth, cut off with a razor-headed arrow, fell<br>down with the shield in it. Even thus, Partha, decked with diadem and<br>garlands, wounded and slew all the foremost warriors of Duryodhana's army<br>with his terrible and death-dealing shafts. Vaikartana also, in the midst<br>of that battle, shot thousands of arrows. These, with a loud whizz, fell<br>upon the son of Pandu like torrents of rain poured from the clouds. Then<br>piercing Bhimasena and Janardana and the diadem-decked Arjuna of<br>superhuman feats, each with three arrows Karna of terrible might uttered<br>a loud awful roar. Struck with Karna's shafts, the diadem-decked Arjuna,<br>beholding Bhima and Janardana, became unable to endure (the feats of his<br>antagonist). Once more, therefore, Partha shot eight and ten arrows.<br>Piercing the beautiful standard of Karna with one of those arrows, he<br>pierced Shalya with four and Karna himself with three. With ten other<br>well-shot shafts he then struck the Kaurava warrior Sabhapati, clad in<br>golden mail. Thereupon that prince, deprived of head and arms and steeds<br>and driver and bow and standard, fell down, wounded and dead, from his<br>foremost of cars, like a Sala tree cut down with an axe. Once more<br>piercing Karna with three, eight, twelve, four, and ten arrows, Partha<br>slew 400 elephants equipped with many weapons, and 8000 car-warriors, and<br>1,000 steeds with riders, and 8,000 brave foot-soldiers. And soon Partha<br>made Karna with his driver and car and steeds and standard invisible with<br>straightly coursing shafts. Then the Kauravas, thus slaughtered by<br>Dhananjaya, loudly addressed Adhitratha's son, saying, "Shoot thy arrows<br>and slay the son of Pandu. Already, he has begun to exterminate the Kurus<br>with his shafts!" Thus urged, Karna, with his best endeavours,<br>incessantly shot many arrows. Capable of cutting the very vitals, those<br>blood-drinking shafts, well sped by Karna, slew large numbers of the<br>Pandavas and the Pancalas. Thus those two foremost of all bowmen, those<br>two warriors of great strength that were capable of bearing all foes,<br>those two heroes acquainted with weapons, struck the warriors opposed to<br>them, as also each other, with mighty weapons. Then Yudhishthira, clad in<br>golden mail, his arrows having been extracted and himself made sound with<br>mantras and drugs by foremost of surgeons well-disposed towards him,<br>quickly came to that spot for witnessing (the encounter between Arjuna<br>and Karna). Beholding king Yudhishthira the just arrived there like the<br>resplendent full Moon freed from the jaws of Rahu and risen in the<br>firmament, all creatures became filled with delight. Beholding those two<br>foremost of warriors, those two first of heroes and slayers of foes,<br>viz., Karna and Partha, engaged in fight, the spectators, both celestial<br>and terrestrial, restraining the animals they rode or that were yoked<br>unto their vehicles, stood motionless. As the two heroes, O king, struck<br>each other with many foremost of arrows, O king, the sounds caused by the<br>bows, bow-strings, and palms, of both Dhananjaya and Adhiratha's son,<br>became tremendous and their well-sped arrows also caused a deafening<br>whizz. Then the bow-string of the son of Pandu, stretched with force,<br>broke with a loud noise. During the interval thus offered, the Suta's son<br>pierced Partha with a hundred small arrows, keen and steeped in oil,<br>winged with the feathers of birds, and resembling snakes freed from their<br>sloughs. He then quickly pierced Vasudeva with sixty shafts, and then<br>Phalguna again with eight. Surya's son then pierced Bhima with thousands<br>upon thousands of mighty arrows. Having pierced Krishna and Partha's<br>standard, Karna felled many amongst the Somakas that followed Partha.<br>These, however, in return shrouded Karna with showers of straight shafts<br>like masses of clouds shrouding the sun in the welkin. Accomplished in<br>the use of weapons, the Suta's son, stupefying those advancing warriors<br>with his shafts and baffling all the weapons shot by them, destroyed<br>their cars and steeds and elephants. And the Suta's son, O king, also<br>afflicted with his arrows many foremost of warriors among them. Their<br>bodies pierced with Karna's shafts, they fell down on the ground,<br>deprived of life and making a loud noise as they fell. Indeed, those<br>mighty combatants, afflicted by Karna of terrible strength, perished like<br>a pack of dogs afflicted by an angry lion. And once more many foremost of<br>combatants among the Pancalas and many such (among the Kauravas) fell<br>down after this, slain by Karna and Dhananjaya. Deprived of life by the<br>mighty Karna with well-aimed arrows shot with great force, many fell<br>down, purging the contents of their stomachs. Then thy troops, regarding<br>the victory to be already theirs, clapped furiously and uttered loud<br>leonine roars. Indeed, in that dreadful encounter, all of them regarded<br>the two Krishnas to have been brought by Karna under his power. Then<br>quickly bending his bow-string and baffling all those shafts of<br>Adhiratha's son, Partha, filled with rage in consequence of his limbs<br>having been mangled with Karna's arrows, assailed the Kauravas. Rubbing<br>his bow-string, he clapped his palms and suddenly caused a darkness there<br>with the showers of shafts he shot. The diadem-decked Arjuna pierced<br>Karna and Shalya and all the Kurus with those arrows. The welkin having<br>been darkened by means of that mighty weapon, the very birds were unable<br>to range in their element, a delicious wind then blew, bearing fragrant<br>odours. Laughing the while, Partha forcibly struck Shalya's armour with<br>ten arrows. Piercing Karna next with a dozen shafts, he struck him once<br>more with seven. Deeply struck with those winged arrows of fierce energy<br>shot with great force from Partha's bow, Karna, with mangled limbs and<br>body bathed in blood, looked resplendent like Rudra at the universal<br>destruction, sporting in the midst of crematorium at noon or eve, his<br>body dyed with blood. The son of Adhiratha then pierced Dhananjaya who<br>resembled the chief of the celestials himself (in energy and might) with<br>three arrows, and he caused five other blazing arrows resembling five<br>snakes to penetrate the body of Krishna. Shot with great force, those<br>arrows, decked with gold, pierced through the armour of that foremost of<br>beings and passing out of his body fell upon the earth. Endued with great<br>energy, they entered the earth with great force and having bathed (in the<br>waters of the Bhogavati in the nether region) coursed back towards Karna.<br>Those shafts were five mighty snakes that had adopted the side of<br>Takshaka's son (Aswasena whose mother Partha had slain at Khandava). With<br>ten broad-headed arrows shot with great force, Arjuna cut off each of<br>those five snakes into three fragments whereupon they fell down on the<br>earth. Beholding Krishna's limbs thus mangled with those snakes<br>transformed into arrows sped from Karna's arms, Arjuna, decked with<br>diadem and garlands, blazed up with wrath like a fire engaged in burning<br>a heap of dry grass. He then pierced Karna in all his vital limbs with<br>many blazing and fatal shafts shot from the bow-string stretched to the<br>very ear. (Deeply pierced), Karna trembled in pain. With the greatest<br>difficulty he stood, summoning all his patience. Dhananjaya having been<br>filled with wrath, all the points of the compass, cardinal and<br>subsidiary, the very splendour of the Sun, and Karna's car, O king, all<br>became invisible with the showers shot by him. The welkin seemed as if it<br>were shrouded by a thick forest. Then that slayer of foes, that bull of<br>Kuru's race, that foremost of heroes, viz., Savyasaci, O king, soon slew<br>in that battle 2,000 foremost of Kuru warriors, with their cars and<br>steeds and drivers, forming the protectors of Karna's car-wheels and<br>wings and his van-guard and rear-guard and who constituted the very pick<br>of Duryodhana's car-force, and who, urged by Duryodhana, had been<br>fighting with great energy. Then thy sons and the Kauravas that were<br>still alive fled away, deserting Karna, and abandoning their dying and<br>wounded, and their wailing sons and sires. Beholding himself abandoned by<br>the terrified Kurus and seeing the space around him empty, Karna felt no<br>agitation, O Bharata, but, on the other hand, rushed at Arjuna, with a<br>cheerful heart.'"
