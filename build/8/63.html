                            "Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile Karna also began, with his arrowy showers, to<br>afflict the mighty car-warriors of the Kaikayas, viz., those great bowmen<br>that stood before him. Indeed, the son of Radha despatched to Yama's<br>abode full five hundred of those warriors that were employed in checking<br>him in that battle. Beholding the son of Radha to be irresistible in that<br>battle, those warriors, afflicted with the arrows of their assailant,<br>repaired to the presence of Bhimasena. Breaking that car-force into many<br>parts by means of his arrows, Karna, singly and riding on that same car<br>of his, pursued Yudhishthira, who then, exceedingly mangled with arrows<br>and almost insensible, was proceeding slowly for reaching the Pandava<br>encampment with Nakula and Sahadeva on his two sides. Having approached<br>the king, the Suta's son, from desire of doing good to Duryodhana,<br>pierced the son of Pandu with three formidable arrows. In return, the<br>king pierced Radha's son in the centre of the chest and then his driver<br>with three shafts. Then those two scorchers of foes, viz., the twin sons<br>of Madri, those two protectors of Yudhishthira's car-wheels, rushed<br>towards Karna so that the latter might not succeed in slaying the king.<br>Then Nakula and Sahadeva, both shooting showers of shafts with great<br>care, covered the son of Radha therewith. The valiant son of the Suta,<br>however, in return, pierced those two high-souled chastisers of foes with<br>two broad-headed arrows of great sharpness. The son of Radha then slew<br>Yudhishthira's excellent steeds, white as ivory and fleet as the mind,<br>and having black hair in their tails. Then, smiling the while, the Suta's<br>son, that great bowman, with another broadheaded shaft, felled the<br>head-gear of Kunti's son. Similarly, the valiant Karna, having slain the<br>steeds of Nakula, cut off the car shafts and bow of that intelligent son<br>of Madri. Those two steedless and carless sons of Pandu,&#8212;those two<br>brothers,&#8212;thereupon ascended the car of Sahadeva. Beholding those two<br>brothers made carless, that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., their<br>maternal uncle, the ruler of the Madras, moved by compassion, addressed<br>the son of Radha and said, "Thou art to fight today with Pritha's son<br>Phalguna. Why dost thou then, with rage inflamed to such a pitch, battle<br>with Dharma's royal son? Thou art suffering thy weapons to be exhausted.<br>Thy own armour is being weakened. With thy shafts reduced, and without<br>quivers, with thy driver and steeds fatigued, and thyself mangled by foes<br>with weapons, when thou wilt approach Partha, O son of Radha, thou wilt<br>be an object of derision and mirth." Though thus addressed by the ruler<br>of the Madras, Karna still, filled with rage, continued to assail<br>Yudhishthira in battle. And he continued to pierce the two sons of Madri<br>by Pandu with many keen arrows. Smiling the while, by means of his shafts<br>he made Yudhishthira turn his face from the battle. Then Shalya,<br>laughing, once more said unto Karna as the latter, excited with great<br>wrath and resolved upon Yudhishthira's destruction stood on his car,<br>these words, "Him for whose sake Dhritarashtra's son always honours thee,<br>slay that Partha, O son of Radha. What wouldst thou gain by slaying<br>Yudhishthira? The two Krishnas are blowing their conchs, whose loud blare<br>is being heard. The twang also of Arjuna's bow is being heard, like the<br>roar of the clouds in the season of rains. There, Arjuna, striking down<br>the foremost of our car-warriors with his arrowy down-pours, is devouring<br>all our troops. Behold him, O Karna, in this battle. The two that are<br>protecting his rear are Yudhamanyu and Uttamauja. The brave Satyaki is<br>protecting his left wheel, and Dhrishtadyumna is protecting his right<br>wheel. There, Bhimasena is fighting with the royal son of Dhritarashtra.<br>Act in such way, O son of Radha, that Bhima may not be able to slay the<br>king today in the sight of us all,&#8212;that the king may, indeed, escape<br>him. Behold, Duryodhana is brought under the power of Bhimasena, that<br>ornament of battle. Approaching if thou canst rescue him, it will,<br>indeed, be a very wonderful feat. Going thither, rescue the king, for a<br>great peril has overtaken him. What wilt thou gain by slaying the sons of<br>Madri or king Yudhishthira?" Hearing these words of Shalya, O lord of<br>Earth, and beholding Duryodhana overpowered by Bhima in that dreadful<br>battle, the valiant son of Radha, thus urged by the words of Shalya and<br>exceedingly desirous of rescuing the king, left Ajatasatru and the twin<br>sons of Madri by Pandu, and rushed for rescuing thy son. He was borne by<br>his steeds that were fleet as birds and that were urged by the ruler of<br>the Madras. After Karna had gone away, Kunti's son Yudhishthira<br>retreated, borne, O sire, by the fleet steeds of Sahadeva. With his twin<br>brothers accompanying him, that ruler of men, quickly repairing in shame<br>to the (Pandava) camp, his body exceedingly mangled with shafts, alighted<br>from the car and hastily sat down on an excellent bed. The, arrows then<br>being extracted from his body, the royal son of Pandu, his heart<br>exceedingly afflicted with sorrow's dart, addressed his two brothers,<br>viz., those two mighty car-warriors, the sons of Madri, saying, "Repair<br>quickly to the division of Bhimasena. Roaring like a cloud, Vrikodara is<br>engaged in battle." Riding another car, Nakula, that bull among<br>car-warriors, and Sahadeva of great energy,&#8212;those two brothers, those<br>two crushers of foes,&#8212;both endued with great might, then proceeded<br>towards Bhima, borne by steeds of the utmost fleetness. Indeed, the<br>brothers having together repaired to Bhimasena's division, took up their<br>places there.'"
