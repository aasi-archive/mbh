                            "Sanjaya said, 'Many elephant-warriors riding on their beasts, urged by<br>thy son, proceeded against Dhrishtadyumna, filled with rage and desirous<br>of compassing his destruction. Many foremost of combatants skilled in<br>elephant-fight, belonging to the Easterners, the Southerners, the Angas,<br>the Vangas, the Pundras, the Magadhas, the Tamraliptakas, the Mekalas,<br>the Koshalas, the Madras, the Dasharnas, the Nishadas uniting with the<br>Kalingas, O Bharata, and showering shafts and lances and arrows like<br>pouring clouds, drenched the Pancala force therewith in that battle.<br>Prishata's son covered with his arrows and shafts those (foe-crushing)<br>elephants urged forward by their riders with heels and toes and hooks.<br>Each of those beasts that were huge as hills, the Pancala hero pierced<br>with ten, eight, or six whetted shafts, O Bharata. Beholding the prince<br>of the Pancalas shrouded by those elephants like the Sun by the clouds,<br>the Pandus and the Pancalas proceeded towards him (for his rescue)<br>uttering loud roars and armed with sharp weapons. Pouring their weapons<br>upon those elephants, those warriors began to dance the dance of heroes,<br>aided by the music of their bow-strings and the sound of their palms, and<br>urged by heroes beating the time. Then Nakula and Sahadeva, and the sons<br>of Draupadi, and the Prabhadrakas, and Satyaki, and Shikhandi, and<br>Chekitana endued with great energy,&#8212;all those heroes&#8212;drenched those<br>elephants from every side with their weapons, like the clouds drenching<br>the hills with their showers. Those furious elephants, urged on by<br>mleccha warriors dragging down with their trunks men and steeds and cars,<br>crushed them with their feet. And some they pierced with the points of<br>their tusks, and some they raised aloft and dashed down on the ground;<br>others taken aloft on the tusks of those huge beasts, fell down inspiring<br>spectators with fear. Then Satyaki, piercing the vitals of the elephant<br>belonging to the king of the Vangas staying before him, with a long shaft<br>endued with great impetuosity, caused it to fall down on the field of<br>battle. Then Satyaki pierced with another long shaft the chest of the<br>rider whom he could not hitherto touch, just as the latter was about to<br>jump from the back of his beast. Thus struck by Satwata, he fell down on<br>the Earth.<br><br>"'Meanwhile Sahadeva, with three shafts shot with great care, struck the<br>elephant of Pundra, as it advanced against him like a moving mountain,<br>depriving it of its standard and driver and armour and life. Having thus<br>cut off that elephant, Sahadeva proceeded against the chief of the Angas.<br><br>"'Nakula, however, causing Sahadeva to desist, himself afflicted the<br>ruler of the Angas with three long shafts, each resembling the rod of<br>Yama, and his foe's elephant with a hundred arrows. Then the ruler of the<br>Angas hurled at Nakula eight hundred lances bright as the rays of the<br>Sun. Each of these Nakula cut off into three fragments. The son of Pandu<br>then cut off the head of his antagonist with a crescent-shaped arrow. At<br>this that mleccha king, deprived of life, fell down with the animal he<br>rode. Upon the fall of the prince of the Angas who was well-skilled in<br>elephant-lore, the elephant-men of the Angas, filled with rage, proceeded<br>with speed against Nakula, on their elephants decked with banners that<br>waved in the air, possessing excellent mouths, adorned with housings of<br>gold, and looking like blazing mountains, from desire of crushing him to<br>pieces. And many Mekalas and Utkalas, and Kalingas, and Nishadas, and<br>Tamraliptakas, also advanced against Nakula, showering their shafts and<br>lances, desirous of slaying him. Then the Pandus, the Pancalas, and the<br>Somakas, filled with rage, rushed with speed for the rescue of Nakula<br>shrouded by those warriors like the Sun by the clouds. Then occurred a<br>fierce battle between those car-warriors and elephant-men, the former<br>showering their arrows and shafts the latter their lances by thousands.<br>The frontal globes and other limbs and the tusks and adornments of the<br>elephants, exceedingly pierced with shafts, were split and mangled. Then<br>Sahadeva, with four and sixty impetuous arrows, quickly slew eight of<br>those huge elephants which fell down with their riders. And Nakula also,<br>that delighter of his race, bending his excellent bow with great vigour,<br>with many straight shafts, slew many elephants. Then the Pancala prince,<br>and the grandson of Sini (Satyaki) and the sons of Draupadi and the<br>Prabhadrakas, and Shikhandi, drenched those huge elephants with showers<br>of shafts. Then in consequence of those rain-charged clouds constituted<br>by the Pandava warriors, those hills constituted by the elephants of the<br>foe, fell, struck down by torrents of rain formed by their numerous<br>shafts, like real mountains struck down with a thunder-storm. Those<br>leaders of the Pandava car-warriors then, thus slaying those elephants of<br>thine cast their eyes on the hostile army, which, as it fled away at that<br>time resembled a river whose continents had been washed away. Those<br>warriors of Pandu's son, having thus agitated that army of thine,<br>agitated it once more, and then rushed against Karna.'"
