                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Exceedingly difficult of accomplishment was that<br>feat, O Sanjaya, which was achieved by Bhima who caused the mighty-armed<br>Karna himself to measure his length on the terrace of his car. There is<br>only one person, Karna, who will slay the Pandavas along with the<br>Srinjayas&#8212;even this is what Duryodhana, O Suta, used very often to say<br>unto me. Beholding, however, that son of Radha now defeated by Bhima in<br>battle, what did my son Duryodhana next do?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Radha's son of the Suta caste turned back from<br>the fight in that great battle, thy son, O monarch, addressed his uterine<br>brothers, saying, "Go ye quickly, blessed be ye, and protect the son of<br>Radha who is plunged into that fathomless ocean of calamity represented<br>by the fear of Bhimasena." Thus commanded by the king, those princes,<br>excited with wrath and desirous of slaying Bhimasena, rushed towards him<br>like insects towards a blazing fire. They were Srutarvan and Durddhara<br>and Kratha and Vivitsu and Vikata and Soma, and Nishangin and Kavashin<br>and Pasin and Nanda and Upanandaka, and Duspradharsha and Suvahu and<br>Vatavega and Suvarchasas, and Dhanurgraha and Durmada and Jalasandha and<br>Sala and Saha. Surrounded by a large car-force, those princes, endued<br>with great energy and might, approached Bhimasena and encompassed him on<br>all sides. They sped at him from every side showers of arrows of diverse<br>kinds. Thus afflicted by them, Bhima of great strength, O king, quickly<br>slew fifty foremost car-warriors with five hundred others, amongst those<br>sons of thine that advanced against him. Filled with rage, Bhimasena<br>then, O king, with a broad-headed arrow, struck off the head of Vivitsu<br>adorned with earrings and head-gear, and graced with a face resembling<br>the full moon. Thus cut off, that prince fell down on the Earth.<br>Beholding that heroic brother of theirs slain, the (other) brothers<br>there, O lord, rushed in that battle, from every side, upon Bhima of<br>terrible prowess. With two other broad-headed arrows then, Bhima of<br>terrible prowess took the lives of two other sons of thine in that<br>dreadful battle. Those two, Vikata and Saha, looking like a couple of<br>celestial youths, O king, thereupon fell down on the Earth like a couple<br>of trees uprooted by the tempest. Then Bhima, without losing a moment,<br>despatched Kratha to the abode of Yama, with a long arrow of keen point.<br>Deprived of life, that prince fell down on the Earth. Loud cries of woe<br>then, O ruler of men, arose there when those heroic sons of thine, all<br>great bowmen, were being thus slaughtered. When those troops were once<br>more agitated, the mighty Bhima, O monarch, then despatched Nanda and<br>Upananda in that battle to Yama's abode. Thereupon thy sons, exceedingly<br>agitated and inspired with fear, fled away, seeing that Bhimasena in that<br>battle behaved like the Destroyer himself at the end of the Yuga.<br>Beholding those sons of thine slain, the Suta's son with a cheerless<br>heart once more urged his steeds of the hue of swans to that place where<br>the son of Pandu was. Those steeds, O king, urged on by the ruler of<br>Madras, approached with great speed the car of Bhimasena and mingled in<br>battle. The collision, O monarch, that once more took place between Karna<br>and the son of Pandu in battle, became, O king, exceedingly fierce and<br>awful and fraught with a loud din. Beholding, O king, those two mighty<br>car-warriors close with each other, I became very curious to observe the<br>course of the battle. Then Bhima, boasting of his prowess in battle,<br>covered Karna in that encounter, O king, with showers of winged shafts in<br>the very sight of thy sons. Then Karna, that warrior acquainted with the<br>highest of weapons, filled with wrath, pierced Bhima with nine<br>broad-headed and straight arrows made entirely of iron. Thereupon the<br>mighty-armed Bhima of terrible prowess, thus struck by Karna, pierced his<br>assailant in return with seven shafts sped from his bow-string drawn to<br>his ear. Then Karna, O monarch, sighing like a snake of virulent poison,<br>shrouded the son of Pandu with a thick shower of arrows. The mighty Bhima<br>also, shrouding that mighty car-warrior with dense arrowy downpours in<br>the very sight of the Kauravas, uttered a loud shout. Then Karna, filled<br>with rage, grasped his strong bow and pierced Bhima with ten arrows<br>whetted on stone and equipped with kanka feathers. With another<br>broad-headed arrow of great sharpness, he also cut off Bhima's bow. Then<br>the mighty-armed Bhima of great strength, taking up a terrible parigha,<br>twined round with hempen cords and decked with gold and resembling a<br>second bludgeon of Death himself, and desiring to slay Karna outright,<br>hurled it at him with a loud roar. Karna, however, with a number of<br>arrows resembling snakes of virulent poison, cut off into many fragments<br>that spiked mace as it coursed towards him with the tremendous peal of<br>thunder. Then Bhima, that grinder of hostile troops, grasping his bow<br>with greater strength, covered Karna with keen shafts. The battle that<br>took place between Karna and the son of Pandu in that meeting became<br>awful for a moment, like that of a couple of huge lions desirous of<br>slaying each other. Then Karna, O king, drawing the bow with great force<br>and stretching the string to his very ear, pierced Bhimasena with three<br>arrows. Deeply pierced by Karna, that great bowman and foremost of all<br>persons endued with might then took up a terrible shaft capable of<br>piercing through the body of his antagonist. That shaft, cutting through<br>Karna's armour and piercing through his body, passed out and entered the<br>Earth like a snake into ant-hill. In consequence of the violence of that<br>stroke, Karna felt great pain and became exceedingly agitated. Indeed, he<br>trembled on his car like a mountain during an earthquake. Then Karna, O<br>king, filled with rage and the desire to retaliate, struck Bhima with<br>five and twenty shafts, and then with many more. With one arrow he then<br>cut off Bhimasena's standard, and with another broad-headed arrow he<br>despatched Bhima's driver to the presence of Yama. Next quickly cutting<br>off the bow of Pandu's son with another winged arrow, Karna deprived<br>Bhima of terrible feats of his car. Deprived of his car, O chief of<br>Bharata's race, the mighty-armed Bhima, who resembled the Wind-god (in<br>prowess) took up a mace and jumped down from his excellent vehicle.<br>Indeed, jumping down from his car with great fury, Bhima began to slay<br>thy troops, O king, like the wind destroying the clouds of autumn.<br>Suddenly the son of Pandu, that scorcher of foes, filled with wrath,<br>routed seven hundred elephants, O king, endued with tusks as large as<br>plough-shafts, and all skilled in smiting hostile troops. Possessed of<br>great strength and a knowledge of what the vital parts of an elephant<br>are, he struck them on their temples and frontal globes and eyes and the<br>parts above their gums. Thereupon those animals, inspired with fear, ran<br>away. But urged again by their drivers they surrounded Bhimasena once<br>more, like the clouds covering the Sun. Like Indra felling mountains with<br>thunder, Bhima with his mace prostrated those seven hundred elephants<br>with their riders and weapons and standards. That chastiser of foes, the<br>son of Kunti, next pressed down two and fifty elephants of great strength<br>belonging to the son of Subala. Scorching thy army, the son of Pandu then<br>destroyed a century of foremost cars and several hundreds of<br>foot-soldiers in that battle. Scorched by the Sun as also by the<br>high-souled Bhima, thy army began to shrink like a piece of leather<br>spread over a fire. Those troops of thine, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>filled with anxiety through fear of Bhimasena, avoided Bhima in that<br>battle and fled away in all directions. Then five hundred car-warriors,<br>cased in excellent mail, rushed towards Bhima with loud shouts, shooting<br>thick showers of arrows on all sides. Like Vishnu destroying the Asuras,<br>Bhima destroyed with his mace all those brave warriors with their drivers<br>and cars and banners and standards and weapons. Then 3,000 horsemen,<br>despatched by Shakuni, respected by all brave men and armed with darts<br>and swords and lances, rushed towards Bhima. That slayer of foes,<br>advancing impetuously towards them, and coursing in diverse tracks, slew<br>them with his mace. Loud sounds arose from among them while they were<br>being assailed by Bhima, like those that arise from among herd of<br>elephants struck with large pieces of rocks. Having slain those 3,000<br>excellent horses of Subala's son in that way, he rode upon another car,<br>and filled with rage proceeded against the son of Radha. Meanwhile, Karna<br>also, O king, covered Dharma's son (Yudhishthira) that chastiser of foes,<br>with thick showers of arrows, and felled his driver. Then that mighty<br>car-warrior beholding Yudhishthira fly away in that battle, pursued him,<br>shooting many straight-coursing shafts equipped with Kanka feathers. The<br>son of the Wind-god, filled with wrath, and covering the entire welkin<br>with his shafts, shrouded Karna with thick showers of arrows as the<br>latter pursued the king from behind. The son of Radha then, that crusher<br>of foes, turning back from the pursuit, quickly covered Bhima himself<br>with sharp arrows from every side. Then Satyaki, of immeasurable soul, O<br>Bharata, placing himself on the side of Bhima's car, began to afflict<br>Karna who was in front of Bhima. Though exceedingly afflicted by Satyaki,<br>Karna still approached Bhima. Approaching each other those two bulls<br>among all wielders of bows, those two heroes endued with great energy,<br>looked exceedingly resplendent as they sped their beautiful arrows at<br>each other. Spread by them, O monarch, in the welkin, those flights of<br>arrows, blazing as the backs of cranes, looked exceedingly fierce and<br>terrible. In consequence of those thousands of arrows, O king, neither<br>the rays of the Sun nor the points of the compass, cardinal and<br>subsidiary, could any longer be noticed either by ourselves or by the<br>enemy. Indeed, the blazing effulgence of the Sun shining at mid-day was<br>dispelled by those dense showers of arrows shot by Karna and the son of<br>Pandu. Beholding the son of Subala, and Kritavarma, and Drona's son, and<br>Adhiratha's son, and Kripa, engaged with the Pandavas, the Kauravas<br>rallied and came back to the fight. Tremendous became the din, O monarch,<br>that was made by that host as it rushed impetuously against their foes,<br>resembling that terrible noise that is made by many oceans swollen with<br>rains. Furiously engaged in battle, the two hosts became filled with<br>great joy as the warriors beheld and seized one another in that dreadful<br>melee. The battle that commenced at that hour when the Sun had reached<br>the meridian was such that its like had never been heard or seen by us.<br>One vast host rushed against another, like a vast reservoir of water<br>rushing towards the ocean. The din that arose from the two hosts as they<br>roared at each other, was loud and deep as that which may be heard when<br>several oceans mingle with one another. Indeed, the two furious hosts,<br>approaching each other, mingled into one mass like two furious rivers<br>that run into each other.<br><br>"'The battle then commenced, awful and terrible, between the Kurus and<br>the Pandavas, both of whom were inspired with the desire of winning great<br>fame. A perfect Babel of voices of the shouting warriors was incessantly<br>heard there, O royal Bharata, as they addressed one another by name. He<br>who had anything, by his father's or mother's side or in respect of his<br>acts or conduct, that could furnish matter for ridicule, was in that<br>battle made to hear it by his antagonist. Beholding those brave warriors<br>loudly rebuking one another in that battle, I thought, O king, that their<br>periods of life had been run out. Beholding the bodies of those angry<br>heroes of immeasurable energy a great fear entered my heart, respecting<br>the dire consequences that would ensue. Then the Pandavas, O king, and<br>the Kauravas also, mighty car-warriors all, striking one another, began<br>to mangle one another with their keen shafts.'"
