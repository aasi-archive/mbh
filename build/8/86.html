                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the gigantic and roaring Karna, incapable of<br>being resisted by the very gods, advancing like the surging sea, that<br>bull amongst men, viz., he of Dasharha's race, addressed Arjuna, saying,<br>"That car-warrior having white steeds and owning Shalya for his driver<br>cometh hither with whom thou art to contend in battle. Therefore, O<br>Dhananjaya, summon all thy coolness. Behold then, O son of Pandu, the<br>well-equipped car of Karna. White steeds are yoked unto it and Radha's<br>son himself is the warrior that stands upon it. Teeming with banners and<br>decked with rows of bells, it looks like a celestial car borne along the<br>welkin by steeds white in hue. Behold also the standard of the<br>high-souled Karna, bearing the device of the elephant's rope, and looking<br>like the bow of Indra himself that divides the firmament by a clear line.<br>Behold Karna as he advanceth from desire of doing what is agreeable to<br>Dhritarashtra's son, shooting showers of shafts like the clouds pouring<br>torrents of rain. There the royal chief of the Madras, stationed on the<br>fore-part of the car, guideth the steeds of Radha's son of immeasurable<br>energy. Hear the peal of their drums and the fierce blare of their<br>conchs. Hear, O son of Pandu, the diverse leonine roars coming from every<br>side. Hear the terrible twang, silencing all other loud sounds, of the<br>bow (Vijaya) stretched by Karna of immeasurable energy. There the mighty<br>car-warriors among the Pancalas, with their followers, are breaking like<br>a herd of deer in the great forest at the sight of an angry lion. It<br>behoveth thee, O son of Kunti, to slay the Suta's son with every care. No<br>other person save thee can venture to bear the shafts of Karna. It is<br>well known to me that thou art competent to vanquish in battle the three<br>worlds with all their mobile and immobile creatures including the very<br>gods and the Gandharvas. What need be said about battling with that<br>puissant one, when people are incapable of even gazing at him, viz., the<br>fierce and terrible Isana, that great god, the three-eyed Sarva,<br>otherwise called Kapardin? Thou, however, hadst, by battle, gratified<br>that god of gods himself, that Siva who is the source of bliss unto all<br>creatures, that deity called Sthanu. The other deities also have all<br>given thee boons. Through the grace, O Partha, of that god of gods, that<br>deity armed with a trident, slay Karna, O mighty-armed one, like Indra<br>slaying the Asura Namuci. Let prosperity be ever with thee, O Partha, and<br>do thou obtain victory in battle."<br><br>"'Arjuna said, "My victory, O Krishna, is, certain. There is no doubt in<br>this, since thou, O slayer of Madhu, that art the master of all the<br>worlds, art pleased with me. Urge the steeds, O Hrishikesha, and my car,<br>O great car-warrior! Today Phalguna will not return from battle without<br>slaying Karna. Behold Karna slain today and cut in pieces with my shafts.<br>Or, O Govinda, thou wilt today behold me slain with (Karna's) arrows.<br>That terrible battle, capable of stupefying the three words, is at hand.<br>As long as the earth will last, people will speak of it." Saying these<br>words unto Krishna who is never tired with exertion, Partha quickly<br>proceeded on his car against Karna like an elephant against a rival<br>elephant. Once more Partha of great energy said unto Krishna, that<br>chastiser of foes, these words, "Urge the steeds, O Hrishikesha, for time<br>passeth." Thus addressed by the high-souled son of Pandu, Keshava wished<br>him victory and urged steeds as fleet as thought. Then that car of<br>Pandu's son, possessed of great speed, soon reached the front of Karna's<br>car.'"
