                            "Sanjaya said, 'After Karna had thus been slain and the Kaurava troops<br>had fled away, he of Dasharha's race, embracing Partha from joy, said<br>unto him these words: "Vritra was slain by thee. Men will talk (in the<br>same breath) of the slaughter of Vritra and Karna in awful battle. Vritra<br>was slain in battle by the deity of great energy with his thunder. Karna<br>hath been slain by thee with bow and sharp arrows. Go, O son of Kunti,<br>and represent, O Bharata, unto king Yudhishthira the just, this prowess<br>of thine that is capable of procuring thee great fame and that hath<br>become well-known in the world. Having represented unto king Yudhishthira<br>the just, this slaughter of Karna in battle for compassing which thou<br>hadst been endeavouring for a long course of years, thou wilt be freed<br>from the debt thou owest to the king. During the progress of the battle<br>between thyself and Karna, the son of Dharma once came for beholding the<br>field. Having, however, been deeply and exceedingly pierced (with<br>arrows), he could not stay in battle. The king, that bull among men, then<br>went back to his tent." Partha answered Keshava, that bull of Yadu's<br>race, saying, "So be it!' The latter then cheerfully caused the car of<br>that foremost of car-warriors to turn back. Having said these words unto<br>Arjuna, Krishna addressed the soldiers, saying, "Blessed be ye, stand all<br>of you carefully, facing the foe!" Unto Dhrishtadyumna and Yudhamanyu and<br>the twin sons of Madri and Vrikodara and Yuyudhana, Govinda said, "Ye<br>kings, until we come back having informed the king of Karna's slaughter<br>by Arjuna, stand ye here with care." Having received the permission of<br>these heroes, he then set out for the quarters of the king. With Partha<br>in his company, Govinda beheld Yudhishthira, that tiger among kings,<br>lying on an excellent bed of gold. Both of them then, with great joy,<br>touched the feet of the king. Beholding their joy and the extraordinary<br>wounds on their bodies, Yudhishthira regarded the son of Radha to be dead<br>and rose quickly from his bed. That chastiser of foes, the mighty-armed<br>monarch, having risen from his bed, repeatedly embraced Vasudeva and<br>Arjuna with affection. That descendant of Kuru's race then asked Vasudeva<br>(the particulars of Karna's death). Then the sweet-speeched Vasudeva that<br>descendant of the Yadu race, spoke to him of Karna's death exactly as it<br>had happened. Smiling then, Krishna, otherwise called Acyuta, joined his<br>palms and addressed king Yudhishthira whose foes had been killed saying,<br>"By good luck, the wielder of Gandiva, and Vrikodara, the son of Pandu,<br>and thyself, and the two sons of Madri, are all safe, having been freed<br>from this battle that has been so destructive of heroes and that made the<br>very hair of the body to stand on end. Do thou those acts, O son of<br>Pandu, which should next be done. The Suta's son Karna, possessed of<br>great might and otherwise called Vaikartana, hath been slain. By good<br>luck, victory hath become thine, O king of kings. By good luck, thou<br>growest, O son of Pandu! The Earth drinketh today the blood of that<br>Suta's son, that wretch among men, who had laughed at the dice-won<br>Krishna. That foe of thine, O bull of Kuru's race, lieth today on the<br>bare ground, pierced all over with arrows. Behold that tiger among men,<br>pierced and mangled with shafts. O thou of mighty arms, rule now, with<br>care, this earth that is divested of all thy foes, and enjoy with us, all<br>kinds of enjoyable articles!'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Having heard these words of the high-souled Keshava,<br>Yudhishthira, with great joy, worshipped in return that hero of<br>Dasharha's race. "Good luck, Good luck!" were the words, O monarch, that<br>he said. And he added, "It is not wonderful, O mighty-armed one, in thee,<br>O son of Devaki, that Partha, having obtained thee for his charioteer,<br>should achieve feats that are even super-human." Then that chief of<br>Kuru's race, that righteous son of Pritha, taking hold of Keshava's right<br>arm adorned with Angadas, and addressing both Keshava and Arjuna, said,<br>"Narada told me that ye two are the gods Nara and Narayana, those ancient<br>and best of Rishis, that are ever employed in the preservation of<br>righteousness. Gifted with great intelligence, the master Krishna<br>Dvaipayana, the highly blessed Vyasa, also hath repeatedly told me this<br>celestial history. Through thy influence, O Krishna, this Dhananjaya the<br>son of Pandu, facing his foes, hath vanquished them, without ever turning<br>back from any of them. Victory, and not defeat, we are certain to have,<br>since thou hast accepted the drivership of Partha in battle." Having said<br>these words, king Yudhishthira the just, that tiger among men, mounting<br>his car, adorned with gold and having steeds of ivory white and black<br>tails and fleet as thought harnessed unto it, and surrounded by many<br>Pandava troops, set out, conversing pleasantly with Krishna and Arjuna<br>along the way, for beholding the field of battle on which thousands of<br>incidents had taken place. Conversing with those two heroes, viz.,<br>Madhava and Phalguna, the king beheld Karna, that bull among men, lying<br>on the field of battle. Indeed, king Yudhishthira beheld Karna pierced<br>all over with arrows like a Kadamva flower with straight filaments all<br>around its body. Yudhishthira beheld Karna illuminated by thousands of<br>golden lamps filled with perfumed oil. Having beheld Karna with his son<br>slain and mangled with shafts sped from Gandiva, king Yudhishthira<br>repeatedly looked at him before he could believe his eyes. He then<br>applauded those tigers among men, Madhava and Phalguna, saying, "O<br>Govinda, today I have become king of the earth, with my brothers, in<br>consequence of thyself of great wisdom having become my protector and<br>lord. Hearing of the slaughter of that tiger among men, the proud son of<br>Radha, the wicked-souled son of Dhritarashtra will be filled with<br>despair, as regards both life and kingdom. Through thy grace, O bull<br>among men, we have acquired our objects. By good luck, victory hath been<br>thine, O Govinda! By good luck, the enemy hath been slain. By good luck,<br>the wielder of Gandiva, the son of Pandu, hath been crowned with victory.<br>Thirteen years we have passed in wakefulness and great sorrow. O thou of<br>mighty arms, through thy grace, we will sleep happily this night." In<br>this way, O ruler of men, king Yudhishthira the just, praised Janardana<br>greatly as also Arjuna, O monarch!'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Beholding Karna with his son slain with Partha's<br>shafts, that perpetuator of Kuru's race, Yudhishthira, regarded himself<br>as reborn. The kings (in the Pandava army), great car-warriors&#8212;all<br>filled with joy, approached Kunti's son Yudhishthira and gladdened him<br>greatly. Nakula, and Sahadeva, and Vrikodara the son of Pandu, and<br>Satyaki, O king, that foremost of car-warriors among the Vrishnis, and<br>Dhrishtadyumna, and Shikhandi, and others among the Pandus, the Pancalas,<br>and the Srinjayas, worshipped the son of Kunti at the slaughter of the<br>Suta's son. Extolling king Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu, those<br>delighters in battle, those effectual smiters, those heroes possessed of<br>sureness of aim and longing for victory, also praised those scorchers of<br>foes, viz., the two Krishnas, with speeches fraught with panegyrics. Then<br>those great car-warriors, filled with delight, proceeded towards their<br>own camp. Thus occurred that great carnage, making the hair stand on end,<br>in consequence, O king, of thy evil policy! Why dost thou grieve for it<br>now?'"<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "Hearing those evil tidings, the Kuru king<br>Dhritarashtra suddenly fell down on the ground from his excellent seat.<br>Similarly, the royal lady Gandhari of great foresight fell down. She<br>indulged in diverse lamentations, for the slaughter of Karna in battle.<br>Then Vidura and Sanjaya both raised the fallen monarch and began to<br>console him. Similarly the Kuru ladies raised Gandhari. Thinking destiny<br>and necessity to be all powerful, that royal ascetic, under that great<br>grief, seemed to lose his senses. His heart filled with anxiety and<br>sorrow, the king, however, did not again swoon away. Comforted by them,<br>he remained silent, indulging in melancholy musing. He that reads of this<br>great battle, which is like unto a sacrifice, between the high-souled<br>Dhananjaya and Adhiratha's son, so also he that hears the account of this<br>battle read, both obtain, O Bharata, the fruit of a great sacrifice duly<br>performed. The learned say that the holy and the eternal Vishnu is<br>Sacrifice, and each of those other gods, viz., Agni, Wind, Soma, and<br>Surya, is so. Therefore, he that will, without malice, hear or recite<br>this Parvan, will be happy and capable of attaining to every region of<br>bliss. Filled with devotion, men always read this sacred and first of<br>Samhitas. They that do, rejoice, obtaining wealth, and grain, and fame. A<br>man must, therefore, ever hear it without malice. He that does so will<br>obtain all kinds of happiness. With that foremost of persons, Vishnu, and<br>the illustrious Self-born, and Bhava also, become pleased. A Brahmana, by<br>reading it, would obtain the fruit of having studied the Vedas; a<br>Kshatriya obtains strength and victory in battle; Vaishyas would obtain<br>immense wealth, and Shudras would obtain health and freedom from disease.<br>Then again the illustrious Vishnu is eternal. And since it is that god<br>who hath been glorified in this Parvan, it is for this that the man<br>reading or hearing it becometh happy and acquireth all the objects of his<br>heart. These words of the great Rishi (Vyasa) can never the untrue! The<br>merit that may be attained by listening to the recitation of the Karna<br>Parvan is equal to his who giveth away unceasingly for a whole year good<br>cows with calves."<br><br>The end of Karna Parv
