                            Janamejaya said, "Having heard of Karna's fall and the slaughter of his<br>sons, what, O foremost of regenerate ones, did the king say, after he had<br>been a little comforted? Indeed, poignant was the grief that he<br>experienced, arising from the calamity that befell his sons! Tell me, I<br>ask thee, all that the king said on that occasion!"<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "Hearing of the slaughter of Karna that was<br>incredible and astounding, that was dreadful and capable of paralysing<br>the senses of all creatures, that looked like the downfall of Meru, or a<br>never-to-be-believed clouding of the intellect of the wise Shukra, or the<br>defeat of Indra of terrible feats at the hands of his foes, or the<br>falling down on the Earth of the resplendent Sun from the firmament, or a<br>scarcely-to-be-comprehended drying up of the ocean, that receptacle of<br>inexhaustible waters, or the annihilation, perfectly astounding, of the<br>earth, the firmament, the points of the compass, and the waters, or the<br>fruitlessness of acts both virtuous and sinful, king Dhritarashtra,<br>having earnestly reflected for some time on it, thought that his army had<br>been annihilated. Thinking that other creatures also, as unslayable as<br>Karna, would meet with a similar fate, king Dhritarashtra the son of<br>Ambika, scorched with grief and sighing like a snake, with limbs almost<br>palsied, long breaths, highly cheerless, and filled with melancholy,<br>began to lament, saying, 'Oh!' and 'Alas!' And the king said, 'O Sanjaya,<br>the heroic son of Adhiratha was endued with the prowess of the lion or<br>the elephant! His neck was as thick as that of a bull, and his eyes,<br>gait, and voice were like the bull's! Of limbs as hard as the<br>thunderbolt, that young man, like a bull never flying away from a bull,<br>never desisted from battle even if his foe happened to be the great Indra<br>himself! At the sound of his bow-string and palms and at the whizz of his<br>arrowy showers men and steeds and cars and elephants fled away from<br>battle. Relying upon that mighty-armed one, that slayer of large bands of<br>foes, that warrior of unfading glory, Duryodhana had provoked hostilities<br>with those mighty car-warriors, the sons of Pandu! How then could Karna,<br>that foremost of car-warriors, that tiger among men, that hero of<br>irresistible onset, be forcibly slain by Partha in battle? Relying on the<br>might of his own arms, he always disregarded Keshava of unfading glory,<br>and Dhananjaya, and the Vrishnis, and all other foes! Often did he use to<br>say unto the foolish, avaricious crestfallen, kingdom-coveting, and<br>afflicted Duryodhana even such words as these, "Alone, I shall, in<br>battle, throw down from their foremost of cars, those two invincible<br>warriors united together, the wielder of sarnga and the wielder of<br>gandiva!" He had subjugated many invincible and mighty foes&#8212;the<br>Gandharas, the Madrakas, the Matsyas, the Trigartas, the Tanganas, the<br>Khasas, the Pancalas, the Videhas, the Kulindas, the Kasi-kosalas, the<br>Suhmas, the Angas, the Nishadhas, the Pundras, the Kichakas, the Vatsas,<br>the Kalingas, the Taralas, the Asmakas, and the Rishikas. Subjugating all<br>these brave races, by means of his keen and whetted arrows equipped with<br>kanka feathers, that foremost of car-warriors, Radha's son, had caused<br>all of them to pay tribute to us for the aggrandisement of Duryodhana.<br>Alas, how could that warrior acquainted with celestial weapons, that<br>protector of armies, Karna the son of Vikartana, called also Vrisha, of<br>mighty energy, be slain in battle by his foes, the heroic and mighty sons<br>of Pandu? As Indra is the foremost of gods, Karna was the foremost of<br>men. In the three worlds no third person has been heard of by us to be<br>like them. Amongst steeds, Uccaisravas is the foremost; amongst Yakshas,<br>Vaishravana is the foremost; amongst celestials, Indra is the foremost;<br>amongst smiters, Karna was the foremost. Unvanquished by even the most<br>heroic and the mightiest of monarchs, he had, Duryodhana's<br>aggrandisement, subjugated the whole earth. The ruler of Magadha, having<br>by conciliation and honours obtained Karna for a friend, had challenged<br>all the Kshatriyas of the world, except the Kauravas and the Yadavas, to<br>battle. Hearing that Karna hath been slain by Savyasaci in single combat,<br>I am plunged in an ocean of woe like a wrecked vessel in the vast deep!<br>Indeed, hearing that that foremost of men, that best of car-warriors,<br>hath been slain in single combat, I am sinking in an ocean of grief like<br>a person without a raft in the sea! When, O Sanjaya, I do not die of such<br>grief, I think my heart is impenetrable and made of something harder than<br>the thunderbolt. Hearing of the defeat and humiliation of kinsmen and<br>relatives and allies, who else in the world, O Suta, save my wretched<br>self, would not yield up his life? I desire to have poison or fire or a<br>fall from the summit of a mountain, I am unable, O Sanjaya, to bear this<br>heavy load of grief!'"
