                            Vaishampayana said, "Upon the fall of Karna, O monarch, the son of<br>Gavalgana, with a cheerless heart, set out that night for Nagapura, on<br>steeds that rivalled the wind in speed. Arrived at Hastinapura, with a<br>heart filled with deep anxiety, he proceeded to Dhritarashtra's abode<br>which no longer teemed with kinsmen and friends. Beholding the king<br>deprived of all energy by grief, joining his hands he worshipped, with a<br>bend of his head, the monarch's feet. Having duly worshipped king<br>Dhritarashtra, he uttered an exclamation of woe and then began, 'I am<br>Sanjaya, O lord of Earth! Art thou not happy? I hope thou art not<br>stupefied, having through thy own faults fallen into such distress?<br>Counsels for thy good had been uttered by Vidura and Ganga's son and<br>Keshava. I hope thou feelest no pain now, remembering thy rejection of<br>those counsels? Counsels for thy good had also been uttered in the<br>assembly by Rama and Narada and Kanwa and others. I hope thou feelest no<br>pain now, remembering their rejection by thee? I hope thou feelest no<br>pain, remembering the slaughter in battle, by the foe, of Bhishma and<br>Drona and others, those friends that were ever engaged in thy good?' Unto<br>the Suta's son who with joined hands was telling him so, the monarch<br>afflicted with grief and drawing a long and hot breath, said these words.<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Hearing, O Sanjaya, of the fall of the heroic son<br>of Ganga, that warrior of all celestial weapons, as also of the fall of<br>that foremost of all bowmen, Drona, my heart feeleth great pain! That<br>hero endued with great energy and born of the Vasus themselves, who slew<br>every day 10,000 car-warriors clad in mail, that high-souled one unto<br>whom Bhrigu's son had given the highest weapons, that warrior who in his<br>childhood had been trained in the science of the bow by Rama, alas, even<br>he hath been slain by Yajnasena's son Shikhandi protected by the<br>Pandavas! At this my heart is greatly pained! That hero through whose<br>grace those mighty car-warriors, the royal sons of Kunti, as also many<br>other lords of Earth, have become maharathas, alas, hearing of the<br>slaughter of that great bowman of sure aim, Drona, by Dhrishtadyumna, my<br>heart is exceedingly pained! Those two had not in the world a person<br>equal to them in (knowledge and use of) the four kinds of weapons! Alas,<br>hearing of the slaughter of these two, Bhishma and Drona, in battle my<br>heart is exceedingly pained! That warrior who had not in the three worlds<br>a person equal to him in knowledge of weapons, alas, hearing of the<br>slaughter of that hero, Drona, what did the people of my side do? After<br>the high-souled son of Pandu, Dhananjaya, exerting himself with prowess,<br>had despatched unto Yama's abode the strong force of the samsaptakas,<br>after the Narayana weapon of the intelligent son of Drona had been<br>baffled, and after the (Kaurava) divisions had begun to fly away, what,<br>indeed, did the people of my side do? I think that, after Drona's death<br>my troops, flying away and sinking in an ocean of grief, resembled<br>shipwrecked mariners struggling on the bosom of the vast deep. What also,<br>O Sanjaya, became the colour of the faces of Duryodhana, and Karna, and<br>Kritavarma the chief of the Bhojas and Shalya, the ruler of the Madras,<br>and of my remaining sons, and of the others, when the Kuru divisions fled<br>away from the field? Tell me all this as it truly happened in battle, O<br>son of Gavalgana, and describe to me the prowess put forth by the<br>Pandavas and the warriors of my side!"<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'O sire, hearing all that has happened unto the Kauravas<br>through thy fault, thou shouldst not feel any anguish! He that is wise<br>never feeleth any pain at what Destiny bringeth! And since Destiny is<br>unconquerable, human purposes may or may not become attainable. Hence, he<br>that is wise never feeleth pain on the acquisition or the reverse of the<br>objects cherished by him.<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'I do not feel great pain, O Sanjaya! I regard all<br>this to be the result of Destiny! Tell me all that thou wishest!'"
