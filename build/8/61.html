                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'When Bhima and Pandu's son Yudhishthira were<br>engaged in battle, when my troops were being slaughtered by the Pandus<br>and the Srinjayas, when, indeed, my vast army being broken and routed<br>repeatedly became cheerless, tell me, O Sanjaya, what the Kauravas did.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the mighty-armed Bhima, the Suta's son of great<br>valour, with eyes red in wrath, O king, rushed towards him. Seeing thy<br>army fly away from Bhimasena, the mighty Karna, O king, rallied it with<br>great efforts. The mighty-armed Karna, having rallied thy son's host,<br>proceeded against the Pandavas, those heroes difficult of defeat in<br>battle. The great car-warriors of the Pandavas also, shaking their bows<br>and shooting their shafts, proceeded against the son of Radha. Bhimasena,<br>and the grandson of Sini, and Shikhandi and Janamejaya, and<br>Dhrishtadyumna of great strength, and all the Prabhadrakas, and those<br>tigers among men, the Pancalas, filled with rage and inspired with desire<br>of victory, rushed in that battle from every side against thy army.<br>Similarly, the great car-warriors of thy army, O king, quickly proceeded<br>against the Pandava host, desirous of slaughtering it. Teeming with cars<br>and elephants and horses, and abounding with foot-soldiers and standards,<br>the two armies then, O tiger among men, assumed a wonderful aspect.<br>Shikhandi proceeded against Karna, and Dhrishtadyumna proceeded against<br>thy son Duhshasana, accompanied by a large force. Nakula proceeded<br>against Vrishasena, while Yudhishthira against Citrasena. Sahadeva, O<br>king, in that battle, proceeded against Uluka. Satyaki proceeded against<br>Shakuni, and the sons of Draupadi against the other Kauravas. The mighty<br>car-warrior Ashvatthama proceeded, with great care, against Arjuna.<br>Sharadvata's son Kripa proceeded against the mighty bowman Yudhamanyu,<br>while Kritavarma of great strength proceeded against Uttamauja. The<br>mighty-armed Bhimasena, O sire, alone and unsupported, resisted all the<br>Kurus and thy sons at the head of their division. The slayer of Bhishma,<br>Shikhandi, then, O monarch, with his winged arrows, resisted Karna,<br>careering fearlessly in that battle. Held in check, Karna then, his lips<br>trembling in rage, assailed Shikhandi with three arrows in the midst of<br>his eyebrows. With those three arrows sticking on his forehead, Shikhandi<br>looked highly beautiful like a silver mountain with three elevated<br>crests. Deeply pierced by the Suta's son in that encounter, the mighty<br>bowman Shikhandi pierced Karna, in return, with ninety keen shafts. The<br>mighty car-warrior Karna then, slaying Shikhandi's steeds and next his<br>driver with three arrows, cut off his standard with a razor-faced arrow.<br>That mighty car-warrior then, that scorcher of foes, filled with rage,<br>jumped down from his steedless car and hurled a dart at Karna. Cutting<br>off that dart with three shafts in that encounter, Karna then, O Bharata,<br>pierced Shikhandi with nine keen arrows. Avoiding then the shafts sped<br>from Karna's bow, that best of men, Shikhandi, exceedingly mangled,<br>retreated speedily from that spot. Then Karna, O monarch, began to<br>scatter the troops of the Pandavas, like a mighty wind scattering a heap<br>of cotton. Meanwhile Dhrishtadyumna, O monarch, afflicted by thy son,<br>pierced Duhshasana, in return, with three arrows in the centre of the<br>chest. Then Duhshasana, O sire, pierced his assailant's left arm with a<br>broad-headed shaft, sharp and straight and equipped with wings of gold.<br>Thus pierced, Dhrishtadyumna, filled with wrath and the desire to<br>retaliate, sped a terrible shaft, O Bharata, at Duhshasana. Thy son,<br>however, O king, with three shafts of his, cut off that impetuous arrow<br>sped by Dhrishtadyumna as it coursed towards him. Approaching<br>Dhrishtadyumna then, he struck him in the arms and the chest with<br>seventeen other broad-headed shafts adorned with gold. Thereat Prishata's<br>son, filled with rage, cut off Duhshasana's bow, O sire, with a sharp<br>razor-headed arrow, at which all the troops there uttered a loud shout.<br>Taking up then another bow, thy son, as if smiling, held Dhrishtadyumna<br>in check with showers of arrows from every side. Beholding the prowess of<br>that high-souled son of thine, the combatants, as also the siddhas and<br>the apsaras, became all filled with wonder. We then saw the mighty<br>Dhrishtadyumna thus assailed by Duhshasana to resemble a huge elephant,<br>held in check by a lion. Then many Pancala car-warriors and elephants and<br>horses, O elder brother of Pandu, desirous of rescuing the commander (of<br>the Pandava army) encompassed thy son. The battle that commenced, O<br>scorcher of foes, between thy warriors and the enemy, presented as<br>frightful a sight as that which may be seen at the destruction of all<br>creatures at the end of the Yuga.<br><br>"'Vrishasena, staying by the side of his father, having pierced Nakula<br>with five arrows made wholly of iron, pierced him once again with three<br>other arrows. The heroic Nakula then, as if smiling, deeply pierced<br>Vrishasena in the chest with a cloth-yard shaft of great keenness. Thus<br>pierced by his mighty foe, that scorcher of foes, viz., Vrishasena,<br>pierced his assailant with twenty arrows and was himself pierced by him<br>with five. Then those two bulls among men shrouded each other with<br>thousands of arrows, at which the divisions that supported them broke.<br>Beholding the troops of Dhritarashtra's son flying away, the Suta's son,<br>following them, O king, began to forcibly stop them. After Karna had gone<br>away, Nakula proceeded against the Kauravas. Karna's son also, avoiding<br>Nakula, proceeded quickly, O sire, to where his father, the son of Radha,<br>was for protecting his car-wheel.<br><br>"'The angry Uluka was held in check by Sahadeva. Having slain his four<br>steeds, the valiant Sahadeva then despatched his foe's driver to the<br>abode of Yama. Uluka then, that delighter of his father, jumping down<br>from his car, O king, quickly proceeded and entered the division of the<br>Trigartas. Satyaki, having pierced Shakuni with twenty keen arrows,<br>easily cut off the standard of Subala's son with a broad-headed arrow.<br>The valiant son of Subala, filled with rage, O king, in that encounter,<br>pierced Satyaki's armour and then cut off his golden standard. Then<br>Satyaki pierced him in return with many keen arrows, and struck his<br>driver, O monarch, with three arrows. With great speed then, he<br>despatched with other shafts the steeds of Shakuni to Yama's abode.<br>Speedily alighting then, O bull among men, from his car, Shakuni, that<br>mighty car-warrior, quickly ascended the car of Uluka. The latter then<br>bore away with great speed his father from Sini's grandson, that warrior<br>skilled in battle. Then Satyaki, O king, rushed in that battle against<br>thy army with great impetuosity, at which that army broke. Shrouded with<br>the arrows of Sini's grandson, thy army, O monarch, fled away on all<br>sides with great speed, and fell down deprived of life.<br><br>"'Thy son resisted Bhimasena in that battle, in a trice Bhima made that<br>ruler of men steedless and driverless and carless and standardless, at<br>which the (Pandava) troops became highly glad. Then thy son, O king, went<br>away from Bhimasena's presence. The whole Kuru army, at this, rushed<br>against Bhimasena. Tremendous became the din made by those combatants<br>inspired with the desire of slaying Bhimasena. Yudhamanyu, piercing<br>Kripa, quickly cut off his bow. Then Kripa, that foremost of all wielders<br>of weapons, taking up another bow, felled Yudhamanyu's standard and<br>driver and umbrella on the Earth. At this, the mighty car-warrior<br>Yudhamanyu retreated on his car, driving it himself. Uttamauja covered<br>the terrible son of Hridika, endued with terrible prowess, with a thick<br>shower of arrows like a cloud pouring torrents of rain on a mountain. The<br>battle between them, O scorcher of foes, became so awful that its like, O<br>monarch, I had never seen before. Then Kritavarma, O king, in that<br>encounter, suddenly pierced Uttamauja in the chest, at which the latter<br>sat down on the terrace of his car. His driver then bore away that<br>foremost of car-warriors. Then the whole Kuru army rushed at Bhimasena.<br>Duhshasana and Subala's son, encompassing the son of Pandu with a large<br>elephant force, began to strike him with small arrows. Then Bhima,<br>causing the wrathful Duryodhana to turn his back on the field by means of<br>hundreds of arrows, quickly rushed towards that elephant force. Beholding<br>that elephant-force advance impetuously against him, Vrikodara became<br>filled with great rage and invoked his celestial weapons. And he began to<br>strike elephants with elephants like Indra striking the Asuras. While<br>engaged in slaughtering those elephants, Vrikodara, in that battle,<br>covered the welkin with his shafts like myriads of insects covering a<br>fire. Like the wind scattering masses of clouds, Bhima quickly scattered<br>and destroyed crowds of elephants united together in thousands. Covered<br>all over with networks of gold, as also with many gems, the elephants<br>looked exceedingly beautiful in that battle like clouds charged with<br>lightning. Slaughtered by Bhima, those elephants, O king, began to fly<br>away. Some amongst them, with their hearts pierced, fell down on the<br>Earth. With those fallen and failing elephants adorned with gold, the<br>Earth looked beautiful there, as if strewn with broken mountains. With<br>the fallen elephant-warriors of blazing resplendence and adorned with<br>gems, the Earth looked beautiful as if strewn with planets of exhausted<br>merit. Then elephants, with their temples, frontal globes, and trunks<br>deeply pierced, fled in hundreds in that battle, afflicted with the<br>shafts of Bhimasena. Some amongst them, huge as hills, afflicted with<br>fear and vomiting blood, ran away, their limbs mangled with arrows, and<br>looked on that account, like mountains with liquid metals running down<br>their sides. People then beheld the two arms of Bhima, resembling two<br>mighty snakes, smeared with sandal-paste and other pounded unguents,<br>continually employed in drawing the bow. Hearing the sound of his<br>bow-string and palms that resembled the peal of thunder, those elephants,<br>ejecting urine and excreta, ran away in fear. The feats of the<br>single-handed Bhima of great intelligence, on that occasion, shone like<br>those of Rudra, himself, while engaged in destroying all creatures.'"
