                            "Sanjaya said, 'Hearing, O sire, these words of Radha's son who delighted<br>in battle, Shalya once more addressed Karna, citing an example, "I am<br>born in the race of men who performed great sacrifices, who never<br>retreated from battle, who were kings whose coronal locks underwent the<br>sacred bath. I am also myself devoted to the practice of virtue. Thou, O<br>Vrisha, seemest to be like one that is intoxicated with spirits. For all<br>that, I will, from friendship, seek to cure thy erring and intoxicated<br>self. Listen, O Karna, to this simile of a crow that I am about to<br>narrate. Having heard it, thou mayest do what thou choosest, O thou that<br>art destitute of intelligence and that art a wretch of thy race. I do<br>not, O Karna, remember the slightest fault in me for which, O thou of<br>mighty arms, thou mayst desire to slay my innocent self. I must tell thee<br>what is for thy good and what is for thy ill, acquainted as I am with<br>both, especially as I am the driver of thy car and desirous of the good<br>of king Duryodhana. What land is level and what not, the strength or<br>weakness of the warrior (on my vehicle), the fatigue and faintness, at<br>all times, of the steeds and the warrior (I am driving), a knowledge of<br>the weapons that are available, the cries of animals and birds, what<br>would be heavy for the steeds and what exceedingly heavy for them, the<br>extraction of arrows and the curing of wounds which weapons counteract<br>which, the several methods of battle, and all kinds of omens and<br>indications, I who am so nearly connected with this car, being none else<br>than its driver, should be familiar with. For this, O Karna, I narrate<br>this instance to thee once more. There lived on the other side of the<br>ocean a Vaishya who had abundance of wealth and corn. He performed<br>sacrifices, made liberal gifts, was peaceful, devoted to the duties of<br>his own order, and pure in habits and mind. He had many sons whom he<br>loved, and was kind unto all creatures. He lived fearlessly in the<br>dominions of a king that was guided by virtue. There was a crow that<br>lived on the refuse of the dishes set before those well-behaved young<br>children of the Vaishya. Those Vaishya children always gave the crow meat<br>and curds, and milk, and sugared milk with rice, and honey, and butter.<br>Thus fed with the refuse of their dishes by the young children of that<br>Vaishya, the crow became arrogant and came to disregard all birds that<br>were equal to him or even superior. It chanced that once certain swans of<br>cheerful hearts, of great speed and capable of going everywhere at will<br>and equal unto Garuda himself in range and speed of flight, came to that<br>side of the ocean. The Vaishya boys, beholding those swans, addressed the<br>crow and said, 'O ranger of the skies, thou art superior to all winged<br>creatures.' Deceived by those children of little understanding, that<br>oviparous creature from folly and pride, regarded their words to be true.<br>Proud of the refuse of the children's dishes upon which he fed, the crow<br>then, alighting in the midst of those swans capable of traversing great<br>distances, desired to enquire as to who amongst them was their leader.<br>The foolish crow at last challenged him amongst those birds of tireless<br>wings whom he regarded their leader, saying, 'Let us compete in flight.'<br>Hearing those words of the raving crow, the swans that had assembled<br>there, those foremost of birds endued with great strength, began to<br>laugh. The swans then, that were capable of going everywhere at will,<br>addressed the crow, saying. 'We are swans, having our abode in the Manasa<br>lake. We traverse the whole Earth, and amongst winged creatures we are<br>always applauded for the length of the distances we traverse. Being, as<br>thou art, only a crow, how canst thou, O fool, challenge a swan endued<br>with might, capable of going everywhere at will, and doing large<br>distances in course of his flight? Tell us, O crow, how thou shalt fly<br>with us.' The boastful crow, in consequence of the foolishness of his<br>species, repeatedly finding fault with the words of that swan, at last<br>gave this answer. The crow said, 'I shall without doubt fly displaying a<br>hundred and one different kinds of motion. Doing every hundred Yojanas in<br>a separate and beautiful kind of motion, I shall display all those<br>motions. Rising up, and swooping down, and whirling around, and coursing<br>straight, and proceeding gently, and advancing steadily, and performing<br>the diverse courses up and receding back, and soaring high, and darting<br>forward and soaring upwards with fiercer velocity, and once more<br>proceeding gently and then proceeding with great impetuosity, and once<br>again swooping down and whirling around and advancing steadily, and<br>rising up by the jerks, and soaring straight, and once more falling down<br>and wheeling in a circle and rushing proudly, and diverse other kinds of<br>motion, these all I shall display in the sight of all you. Ye shall then<br>witness my strength. With one of these different kinds of motion I shall<br>presently rise into the sky. Point out duly, ye swans, by which of these<br>motions I shall course through space. Settling the kind of motion amongst<br>yourselves, you will have to course with me. Adopting all those different<br>motion, ye shall have to course with me through supportless space.' The<br>crow having said these words, one of the swans addressed him, 'Listen, O<br>son of Radha, to the words that the swan said. The swan spoke, 'Thou, O<br>crow, wilt doubtless fly the hundred and one different kinds of flight. I<br>shall, however, fly in that one kind of motion that all (other) birds<br>know, for I do not, O crow, know any other. As regards thee, O thou of<br>red eyes, fly thou in any kind of course that thou likest.' At these<br>words, those crows that had been assembled there laughed aloud, saying,<br>'How will the swan with only one kind of flight get the better of a<br>hundred different kinds of flight?'<br><br>"'"Then those two, viz., the swan and the crow, rose into the sky,<br>challenging each other. Capable of going everywhere at will, the swan<br>proceeded in one kind of motion, while the crow coursed in a hundred<br>different kinds. And the swan flew and the crow also flew, causing each<br>other to wonder (at his skill) and each speaking highly of his own<br>achievements. Beholding the diverse kinds of flight at successive<br>instants of time, the crows that were there were filled with great joy<br>and began to caw more loudly. The swans also laughed in mockery, uttering<br>many remarks disagreeable (to the crows). And they began to soar and<br>alight repeatedly, here and there. And they began to come down and rise<br>up from tree-tops and the surface of the earth. And they uttered diverse<br>cries indicative of their victory. The swan, however, with that one kind<br>of slow motion (with which he was familiar) began to traverse the skies.<br>For a moment, therefore, O sire, he seemed to yield to the crow. The<br>crows, at this, disregarding the swans, said these words: 'That swan<br>amongst you which has soared into the sky, is evidently yielding'.<br>Hearing these words, the (soaring) swan flew westwards with great<br>velocity to the ocean, that abode of Makaras. Then fear entered the heart<br>of the crow who became almost senseless at not seeing any island or trees<br>whereon to perch when tired. And the crow thought within his heart as to<br>where he should alight when tired, upon that vast expanse of water. The<br>ocean, being as it is the abode of countless creatures, is irresistible.<br>Dwelt in by hundreds of monsters, it is grander than space. Nothing can<br>exceed it in depth, O Suta's son. Men know, O Karna, that the waters of<br>the ocean are as limitless as space. For the extent of its waters, O<br>Karna, what is a crow to it? The swan, having traversed a great distance<br>in a moment, looked back at the crow, and (though capable) could not<br>leave him behind. Having transgressed the crow, the swan cast his eyes on<br>him and waited, thinking, 'Let the crow come up.' The crow then,<br>exceedingly tired, came up to the swan. Beholding him succumbing, and<br>about to sink, and desirous of rescuing him in remembrance of the<br>practices of good folks, the swan addressed him in these words, 'Thou<br>hadst repeatedly spoken of many kinds of flight while speaking on the<br>subject. Thou wouldst not speak of this (thy present motion) because of<br>its having been a mystery to us? What is the name of this kind of flight,<br>O crow, that thou hast now adopted? Thou touchest the waters with thy<br>wings and beak repeatedly. Which amongst those diverse kinds of flight is<br>this, O crow, that thou art now practising? Come, come, quickly, O crow,<br>for I am waiting for thee.''"<br><br>"'Shalya continued, "Exceedingly afflicted, and touching the water with<br>his wings and beak, O thou of wicked soul, the crow, beheld in that state<br>by the swan, addressed the latter. Indeed, not seeing the limit of that<br>watery expanse and sinking down in fatigue, and exhausted with the effort<br>of his flight the crow said unto the swan, 'We are crows, we wander<br>hither and thither, crying-caw, caw. 'O swan, I seek thy protection,<br>placing my life-breaths at thy hands. Oh, take me to the shores of the<br>ocean with the wings and beak.' The crow, very much fatigued, suddenly<br>fell down. Beholding him fallen upon the waters of the ocean with a<br>melancholy heart, the swan, addressing the crow who was on the point of<br>death, said these words, 'Remember, O crow, what thou hadst said in<br>praise of thyself. The words even were that thou wouldst course through<br>the sky in a hundred and one different kinds of flight. Thou, therefore<br>that wouldst fly a hundred different kinds of flight, thou that art<br>superior to me, alas, why then art thou tired and fallen down on the<br>ocean?' Overcome with weakness, the crow then, casting his eyes upwards<br>at the swan, and seeking to gratify him, replied, saying, 'Proud of the<br>remains of others' dishes upon which I fed, I had, O swan, regarded<br>myself as the equal of Garuda and disregarded all crows and many other<br>birds. I now, however, seek thy protection and place my life-breaths at<br>thy hands. Oh, take me to the shores of some island. If, O swan, I can, O<br>lord, return in safety to my own country, I will never again disregard<br>anybody. Oh rescue me now from this calamity.' Him that said so and was<br>so melancholy and weeping and deprived of senses, him that was sinking in<br>the ocean, uttering cries 'caw, caw,' him so drenched by the water and so<br>disgusting to look at and trembling with fear, the swan, without a word,<br>took up with his feet, and slowly caused him to ride on his back. Having<br>caused the crow whose senses had deserted him to ride upon his back, the<br>swan quickly returned to that island whence they had both flown,<br>challenging each other. Placing down that ranger of the sky on dry land<br>and comforting him, the swan, fleet as the mind, proceeded to the region<br>he desired. Thus was that crow, fed on the remains of others' dinners,<br>vanquished by the swan. The crow, then, casting off the pride of might<br>and energy, adopted a life of peace and quiet. Indeed, even, as that<br>crow, fed upon the remains of the dinners of the Vaishya children,<br>disregarded his equals and superiors, so dost thou, O Karna, that art fed<br>by the sons of Dhritarashtra upon the remains of their dishes, disregard<br>all thy equals and superiors. Why didst thou not slay Partha at Virata's<br>city when thou hadst the advantage of being protected by Drona and<br>Drona's son and Kripa and Bhishma and the other Kauravas? There where,<br>like a pack of jackals defeated by a lion, ye all were defeated with<br>great slaughter by the diadem-decked Arjuna, what became of your prowess?<br>Beholding also thy brother slain by Savyasaci, in the very sight of the<br>Kuru heroes, it was thou that didst fly away first. By the skirts also of<br>the dvaitya lake, O Karna, when thou wert assailed by the Gandharvas, it<br>was thou that, deserting all the Kurus, didst first run away. Having<br>vanquished in battle the Gandharvas headed by Citrasena, with great<br>slaughter, it was Partha, O Karna, that liberated Duryodhana with his<br>wife. Rama himself, O Karna, before the kings in the (Kuru) assembly<br>spake of the great prowess of both Partha and Keshava. Thou didst<br>frequently hear the words of Drona and Bhishma, speaking in the presence<br>of all the kings, that the two Krishnas are unslayable. I have told thee<br>a little only regarding those matters in which Dhananjaya is superior to<br>thee like the brahmana who is superior to all created beings. Soon wilt<br>thou see, stationed on that foremost of cars, the son of Vasudeva and the<br>son of Kunti and Pandu. As the crow (in the story), acting with<br>intelligence, had sought the protection of the swan, so do thou seek the<br>protection of him of Vrishni's race, and of Pandu's son Dhananjaya. When<br>thou shalt in battle behold Vasudeva and Dhananjaya, those two endued<br>with great prowess, stationed together on the same car, thou shalt not<br>then, O Karna, utter such speeches. When Partha will, with hundreds of<br>arrows, quell thy pride, then wilt thou behold the difference between<br>thyself and Dhananjaya. Those two best of persons are celebrated among<br>the gods, the Asuras and human beings. Thou that art a firefly, do not,<br>from folly, think disrespectfully of those two resplendent luminaries.<br>Like the Sun and moon, Keshava and Arjuna are celebrated for their<br>resplendence. Thou, however, art like a fire-fly among men. O learned<br>one, O son of a Suta, do not think disrespectfully of Acyuta and Arjuna.<br>Those two high-souled persons are lions among men. Forbear indulging in<br>such boasts."'"
