                            "Sanjaya said, 'The white steeded (Arjuna) also, O monarch, routed thy<br>force even as the winds, approaching a heap of cotton, scatters it on all<br>sides. Against him rushed the Trigartas, the Sivis, the Kauravas, the<br>Salwas, the samsaptakas, and that force which consisted of the Narayanas.<br>And Satyasena and Candradeva, and Mitradeva and Satrunjaya, and Susruta's<br>son, and Citrasena, and Mitravarman, O Bharata, and the king of the<br>Trigartas surrounded by his brothers and by his sons that were all mighty<br>bowmen accomplished in diverse weapons, suddenly advanced, shooting and<br>scattering showers of shafts in that battle, against Arjuna, like a<br>fierce current of water towards the ocean. Those warriors in hundreds of<br>thousands, approaching Arjuna, seemed to melt away like snakes at sight<br>of Garuda. Though slaughtered in battle, they did not still leave the son<br>of Pandu like insects, O monarch, never receding from a blazing fire.<br>Satyasena, in that encounter, pierced that son of Pandu with three<br>arrows, and Mitradeva pierced him with three and sixty, and Candradeva<br>with seven. And Mitravarman pierced him with three and seventy arrows,<br>and Susruta's son with seven. And Satrunjaya pierced him with twenty, and<br>Susharma with nine. Thus pierced in that encounter by many, Arjuna<br>pierced all those kings in return. Indeed, piercing the son of Susruta<br>with seven arrows, he pierced Satyasena with three, Satrunjaya with<br>twenty and Candradeva with eight, Mitradeva with a hundred, Srutasena<br>with three, Mitravarman with nine, and Susharma with eight. Then slaying<br>king Satrunjaya with a number of arrows whetted on stone, he smote off<br>from his trunk, the head, decked with headgear, of Susruta's son. Without<br>any delay he then, with a number of other shafts, despatched Candradeva<br>to the abode of Yama. As regards the other mighty car-warriors vigorously<br>contending with him, he checked each of them with five arrows. Then<br>Satyasena filled with rage, hurled a formidable lance in that battle<br>aiming at Krishna and uttered a leonine roar. That ironmouthed lance<br>having a golden shaft, piercing through the left arm of the high-souled<br>Madhava, penetrated into the Earth. Madhava being thus pierced with that<br>lance in great battle the goad and the reins, O king, fell down from his<br>hands. Beholding Vasudeva's limb pierced through, Pritha's son Dhananjaya<br>mustered all his wrath and addressing Vasudeva said, "O mighty-armed one,<br>bear the car to Satyasena, O puissant one, so that I may, with keen<br>shafts, despatch him to Yama's abode." The illustrious Keshava then,<br>quickly taking up the goad and the reins, caused the steeds to bear the<br>car to the front of Satyasena's vehicle. Beholding the Ruler of the<br>Universe pierced, Pritha's son Dhananjaya, that mighty car-warrior,<br>checking Satyasena with some keen arrows, cut off with a number of<br>broad-headed shafts of great sharpness, the large head of that king<br>decked with earrings, from off his trunk at the head of the army. Having<br>thus cut off Satyasena's head, he then despatched Citravarman with a<br>number of keen shafts, and then the latter's driver, O sire, with a keen<br>calf-toothed arrow. Filled with rage, the mighty Partha then, with<br>hundreds of shafts, felled the samsaptakas in hundreds and thousands.<br>Then, O king, with a razor-headed arrow equipped with wings of silver,<br>that mighty car-warrior cut off the head of the illustrious Mitrasena.<br>Filled with rage he then struck Susharma in the shoulder-joint. Then all<br>the samsaptakas, filled with wrath, encompassed Dhananjaya on all sides<br>and began to afflict him with showers of weapons and make all the points<br>of the compass resound with their shouts. Afflicted by them thus, the<br>mighty car-warrior Jishnu, of immeasurable soul, endued with prowess<br>resembling that of Sakra himself, invoked the Aindra weapon. From that<br>weapon, thousands of shafts, O king, began to issue continually. Then O<br>king, a loud din was heard of falling cars with standards and quivers and<br>yokes, and axles and wheels and traces with chords, of bottoms of cars<br>and wooden fences around them, of arrows and steeds and spears and<br>swords, and maces and spiked clubs and darts and lances and axes, and<br>Sataghnis equipped with wheels and arrows. Thighs and necklaces and<br>Angadas and Keyuras, O sire, and garlands and cuirasses and coats of<br>mail, O Bharata, and umbrellas and fans and heads decked with diadems lay<br>on the battle-field. Heads adorned with earrings and beautiful eyes, and<br>each resembling the full moon, looked, as they lay on the field, like<br>stars in the firmament. Adorned with sandal-paste, beautiful garlands of<br>flowers and excellent robes, many were the bodies of slain warriors that<br>were seen to lie on the ground. The field of battle, terrible as it was,<br>looked like the welkin teeming with vapoury forms. With the slain princes<br>and kshatriyas of great might and fallen elephants and steeds, the Earth<br>became impassable in that battle as if she were strewn with hills. There<br>was no path on the field for the wheels of the illustrious Pandava's car,<br>engaged as he was in continually slaying his foes and striking down<br>elephants and steeds with his broad-headed shafts. It seemed, O sire,<br>that the wheels of his car stopped in fright at the sight of his own self<br>careering in that battle through that bloody mire. His steeds, however,<br>endued with the speed of the mind or the wind, dragged with great efforts<br>and labour those wheels that had refused to move. Thus slaughtered by<br>Pandu's son armed with the bow, that host fled away almost entirely,<br>without leaving even a remnant, O Bharata, contending with the foe.<br>Having vanquished large numbers of the samsaptakas in battle, Pritha's<br>son Jishnu looked resplendent, like a blazing fire without smoke.'"
