                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the Pandava heroes rushing impetuously towards<br>thy host, Duryodhana, O monarch, endeavoured to check the warriors of his<br>army on all sides, O bull of Bharata race. Although, however, thy son<br>cried at the top of his voice, his flying troops, O king, still refused<br>to stop. Then one of the wings of the army and its further wing, and<br>Shakuni, the son of Subala, and the Kauravas well-armed turned against<br>Bhimasena in that battle. Karna also, beholding the Dhartarashtra force<br>with all its kings flying away, addressed the ruler of the Madras,<br>saying, "Proceed towards the car of Bhima." Thus addressed by Karna, the<br>ruler of the Madras began to urge those foremost of steeds, of the hue of<br>swans, towards the spot where Vrikodara was. Thus urged by Shalya, that<br>ornament of battle, those steeds approaching the car of Bhimasena,<br>mingled in battle. Meanwhile, Bhima, beholding Karna approach, became<br>filled with rage, and set his heart on the destruction of Karna, O bull<br>of Bharata's race. Addressing the heroic Satyaki and Dhrishtadyumna, the<br>son of Prishata, he said, "Go you to protect king Yudhishthira of<br>virtuous soul. With difficulty he escaped from a situation of great peril<br>before my very eyes. In my sight have the armour and robes of the king<br>been cut off and torn, for Duryodhana's gratification, by Radha's son of<br>wicked soul. I shall today reach the end of that woe, O son of Prishata.<br>Today, either I shall slay Karna in battle, or he will slay me in<br>dreadful battle. I tell thee truly. Today I make over the king to you as<br>sacred pledge. With cheerful hearts exert ye today for protecting the<br>king." Having said these words, the mighty-armed Bhima proceeded towards<br>Adhiratha's son, making all the points of the compass resound with a loud<br>leonine shout. Beholding Bhima, that delighter in battle, advancing<br>quickly, the puissant king of the Madras addressed the Suta's son in the<br>following words:<br><br>"'Shalya said, "Behold, O Karna, the mighty-armed son of Pandu, who is<br>filled with rage. Without doubt, he is desirous of vomiting upon thee<br>that wrath which he has cherished for many years. Never before did I see<br>him assume such a form, not even when Abhimanyu was slain and the<br>Rakshasa Ghatotkaca. Filled with wrath, the form he hath now assumed,<br>endued with the splendour of the all-destroying fire at the end of the<br>Yuga, is such that it seems he is capable of resisting the three worlds<br>united together.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'While the ruler of the Madras was saying these words<br>unto the son of Radha, Vrikodara, excited with rage, came upon Karna.<br>Beholding Bhima, that delighter in battle, approaching him in that way,<br>the son of Radha laughingly said unto Shalya these words, "The words that<br>thou, O ruler of the Madras, hast today spoken to me regarding Bhima, O<br>lord, are without doubt all true. This Vrikodara is brave and is a hero<br>full of wrath. He is reckless in protecting his body, and in strength of<br>limbs he is superior to all. While leading a life of concealment in the<br>city of Virata, relying then on the might of his bare arms, for doing<br>what was agreeable to Draupadi, he secretly slew Kichaka with all his<br>relatives. Even he stands today at the head of battle clad in mail and<br>insensate with wrath. He is ready to engage in battle with the Destroyer<br>armed with uplifted mace. This desire, however, hath been cherished<br>through all my days, viz., that either I shall slay Arjuna or Arjuna will<br>slay me. That desire of mine may be fulfilled today in consequence of my<br>encounter with Bhima. If I slay Bhima or make him carless, Partha may<br>come against me. That will be well for me. Settle that without delay<br>which thou thinkest to be suitable to the hour." Hearing these words of<br>Radha's son of immeasurable energy Shalya replied, saying, "O thou of<br>mighty arms, proceed against Bhimasena of great might. Having checked<br>Bhimasena, thou mayst then obtain Phalguna. That which is thy purpose,<br>that desire which for many long years thou hast cherished in thy heart,<br>will be accomplished, O Karna. I tell the truth." Thus addressed, Karna<br>once more said unto Shalya, "Either I shall slay Arjuna in battle, or he<br>will slay me. Setting thy heart on battle proceed to the spot where<br>Vrikodara is.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Then, O king, Shalya speedily proceeded on that car<br>to the spot where that great bowman, viz., Bhima, was engaged in routing<br>thy army. There rose then the blare of trumpets and the peal of drums, O<br>monarch, when Bhima and Karna met. The mighty Bhimasena, filled with<br>rage, began to scatter thy troops difficult of defeat, with his sharp and<br>polished shafts, to all sides. That collision in battle, O monarch,<br>between Karna and the son of Pandu became, O king, fierce and awful, and<br>the noise that arose was tremendous. Beholding Bhima coming towards him,<br>Karna, otherwise called Vaikartana or Vrisha, filled with rage, struck<br>him with shafts in the centre of the chest. And once more, Karna of<br>immeasurable soul, covered him with a shower of arrows. Thus pierced by<br>the Suta's son, Bhima covered the former with winged arrows. And he once<br>more pierced Karna with nine straight and keen shafts. Then Karna, with a<br>number of arrows, cut in twain Bhima's bow at the handle. And after<br>cutting off his bow, he pierced him once again in the centre of the chest<br>with a shaft of great keenness and capable of penetrating every kind of<br>armour. Then Vrikodara, taking up another bow, O king, and knowing full<br>well what the vital parts of the body are, pierced the Suta's son with<br>many keen arrows. Then Karna pierced him with five and twenty arrows,<br>like a hunter striking a proud and infuriate elephant in the forest with<br>a number of blazing brands. His limbs mangled with those shafts, his eyes<br>red with rage and the desire of revenge, the son of Pandu, insensate with<br>wrath, and impelled by the desire of slaying the Suta's son, fixed on his<br>bow an excellent shaft of great impetuosity, capable of bearing a great<br>strain, and competent to pierce the very mountains. Forcibly drawing the<br>bow-string to his very ear, the son of the Wind-god, that great bowman,<br>filled with wrath and desirous of making an end of Karna, sped that<br>shaft. Thus sped by the mighty Bhima, that shaft, making a noise loud as<br>that of the thunder, pierced through thunderbolt Karna in that battle,<br>like the thunderbolt itself piercing through a mountain. Struck by<br>Bhimasena, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, the Suta's son, that commander<br>(of thy forces), sat down senseless on the terrace of his car. The ruler<br>of the Madras then, beholding the Suta's son deprived of his senses, bore<br>that ornament of battle away on his car, from that fight. Then after<br>Karna's defeat, Bhimasena began to rout the vast Dhartarashtra host like<br>Indra routing the danavas.'"
