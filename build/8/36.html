                            "'Duryodhana said, "This one, O Karna, will act as thy driver, this ruler<br>of the Madras, who is superior to Krishna, like Matali the driver of the<br>chief of the celestials. Indeed, as Matali taketh the management of the<br>car unto which the steeds of Indra are attached, even so will Shalya be<br>the driver of the steeds of thy car today. With thyself as warrior on<br>that vehicle and the ruler of the Madras as its driver, that foremost of<br>car will certainly vanquish the Parthas in battle.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'When the morning came, O monarch, Duryodhana once<br>more addressed the ruler of the Madras endued with great activity,<br>saying, "O ruler of the Madras, hold the reins in battle of Karna's<br>foremost of steeds. Protected by thee, the son of Radha will vanquish<br>Dhananjaya." Thus addressed, Shalya, answering, "So be it" ascended the<br>car, O Bharata. When Shalya approached that car, Karna with a cheerful<br>heart addressed his driver, saying, "O charioteer, quickly equip the car<br>for me." Having duly equipped that triumphal car, the foremost of its<br>kind, which resembled the vapoury mansions in the sky, Shalya presented<br>it to Karna, saying, "Blessed be thou, victory to thee." Then Karna, that<br>foremost of car-warriors, duly worshipping that car which had in days of<br>old been sanctified by a priest conversant with Brahma, and<br>circumambulating it and carefully adoring the god Surya addressed the<br>ruler of the Madras standing near, saying, "Ascend the vehicle."<br>Thereupon Shalya of mighty energy ascended that large, invincible, and<br>foremost of cars, belonging to Karna like a lion ascending a mountain<br>summit. Beholding Shalya stationed, Karna ascended his excellent car like<br>the Sun riding on a mass of clouds charged with lightning. Mounted on the<br>same car, those two heroes endued with the splendour or the Sun of fire<br>looked resplendent like Surya and Agni sitting together on a cloud in the<br>firmament. Eulogised then (by bards and panegyrists), those two heroes of<br>great effulgence looked like Indra and Agni adored with hymns in a<br>sacrifice by Ritwiks and Sadasyas. Karna stood on that car, the reins of<br>whose steeds were held by Shalya, stretching his formidable bow, like the<br>Sun himself within a halo of circular light. Stationed on that foremost<br>of cars, that tiger among men, Karna, with his shafts constituting his<br>rays, looked beautiful like the Sun on the Mandara mountains. Unto the<br>mighty-armed son of Radha that warrior of immeasurable energy, stationed<br>on his car for battle. Duryodhana said these words, "O son of Adhiratha,<br>O hero, do thou achieve that feat difficult of accomplishment which Drona<br>and Bhishma have not achieved in the very sight of all the bowmen. I had<br>always believed that those two mighty car-warriors, viz., Bhishma and<br>Drona, would without doubt slay Arjuna and Bhimasena in battle. Like a<br>second wielder of the thunderbolt, O son of Radha, do thou in great<br>battle achieve that feat worthy of a hero which was not achieved by those<br>two. Either seize king Yudhishthira the just or slay Dhananjaya and<br>Bhimasena, O son of Radha, and the twin sons of Madri. Blessed be thou,<br>let victory be thine. Set out for battle, O tiger among men. Reduce to<br>ashes all the troops of Pandu's son." Then thousands of trumpets and tens<br>of thousands of drums, sounded together, produced a noise like that of<br>the clouds in the welkin. Accepting those words (of Duryodhana), the<br>foremost of car-warriors stationed on his car, viz., the son of Radha,<br>addressed Shalya, that warrior accomplished in battle, saying, "Urge the<br>steeds, O mighty-armed one, so that I may slay Dhananjaya and Bhimasena<br>and both the twins and king Yudhishthira. O Shalya, let Dhananjaya behold<br>today the might of my arms, when I will be engaged in shooting shafts<br>winged with Kanka feathers in hundreds and thousands. Today, O Shalya, I<br>will shoot shafts with great energy for the destruction of the Pandavas<br>and the victory of Duryodhana."<br><br>"'"Shalya said, "O Suta's son, why dost thou think so low of the sons of<br>Pandu, all of whom are endued with great might, all of whom are great<br>bowmen, and all of whom are acquainted with every weapon? They are<br>unretreating, of great good fortune, invincible, and of prowess incapable<br>of being baffled. They are capable of inspiring fear in the heart of<br>Indra himself. When, son of Radha thou wilt hear the twang of Gandiva in<br>battle, resembling the peal of the thunder itself, thou wilt not then<br>utter such speeches. When thou wilt behold Dharma's son and the twins<br>causing a canopy, like that of the clouds in the welkin, with their sharp<br>arrows, and the other invincible kings (of the Pandava army), endued with<br>great lightness of hands and shooting (showers of shafts) and weakening<br>their foes, then thou wilt not utter such words.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Disregarding those words spoken by the ruler of the<br>Madras, Karna addressing him endued with great activity, saying,<br>"Proceed."'"
