                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then the Kurus and the Srinjayas once more fearlessly<br>encountered each other in battle, the Parthas being headed by<br>Yudhishthira, and ourselves headed by the Suta's son. Then commenced a<br>terrible battle, making the hair to stand on end, between Karna and the<br>Pandavas, that increased the population of Yama's kingdom. After that<br>furious battle, producing rivers of blood, had commenced, and when a<br>remnant only of the brave samsaptakas, O Bharata, were left<br>unslaughtered, Dhrishtadyumna, O monarch, with all the kings (on the<br>Pandava side) and those mighty car-warriors&#8212;the Pandavas themselves, all<br>rushed against Karna only. Like the mountain receiving a vast body of<br>water, Karna, unaided by anyone, received in that battle all those<br>advancing warriors filled with joy and longing for victory. Those mighty<br>car-warriors encountering Karna, were beat off and broken like a mass of<br>water, and beat back on all sides when it encounters a mountain. The<br>battle, however, that took place between them and Karna made the hair<br>stand on end. Then Dhrishtadyumna assailed the son of Radha with a<br>straight shaft in that battle, and addressing him said, "Wait, Wait." The<br>mighty car-warrior Karna, filled with rage, shook his foremost of bows<br>called Vijaya, and cutting off the bow of Dhrishtadyumna, as also his<br>arrows resembling snakes of virulent poison assailed Dhrishtadyumna<br>himself with nine arrows. Those arrows, O sinless one, piercing through<br>the gold-decked armour of the high-souled son of Prishata, became bathed<br>in blood and looked beautiful like so many cochineal. The mighty<br>car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna, casting aside that broken bow, took up<br>another bow and a number of shafts resembling snakes of virulent poison.<br>With those straight shafts numbering seventy, he pierced Karna.<br>Similarly, O king, Karna, in that battle, covered Prishata's son, that<br>scorcher of foes, with many shafts resembling snakes of virulent poison.<br>The slayer of Drona, that great bowman, retaliated by piercing Karna with<br>many keen shafts. Filled with rage, Karna then, O monarch, sped at his<br>antagonist a gold-decked shaft that resembled a second rod of death. That<br>terrible shaft, O monarch, as it coursed impetuously towards Prishata's<br>son, the grandson of Sini, O king, cut off into seven fragments,<br>displaying great lightness of hand. Beholding his shaft baffled by the<br>arrows of Satyaki, O king, Karna resisted Satyaki with showers of arrows<br>from every side. And he pierced Satyaki in that encounter with seven<br>clothyard shafts. The grandson of Sini, however, pierced him in return<br>with many arrows decked with gold. The battle then that took place, O<br>king, between those two warriors was such as to fill both spectators and<br>listeners with fear. Though awful, soon it became beautiful and deserving<br>objects of sight. Beholding the feats, in that encounter, of Karna and<br>the grandson of Sini, the hair of all the creatures there present seemed<br>to stand on end. Meanwhile the mighty son of Drona rushed against<br>Prishata's son, that chastiser of foes and queller of the prowess of all<br>enemies. Filled with rage, Drona's son, that subjugator of hostile towns,<br>addressing Dhrishtadyumna, said, "Wait, wait, O slayer of a Brahmana,<br>thou shalt not escape me today with life." Having said these words, that<br>mighty car-warrior of great lightness of hand striving resolutely, deeply<br>pierced the brave son of Prishata, who also strove to the utmost of his<br>prowess, with many keen and terrible shafts endued with great<br>impetuosity. As Drona (while alive), beholding the son of Prishata, O<br>sire, had become cheerless and regarded him as his death, even so the son<br>of Prishata, that slayer of hostile heroes, beholding Drona's son in that<br>battle, now regarded him as his death. Soon, however, remembering that he<br>was unslayable in battle by means of weapons, he rushed with great speed<br>against Drona's son, like the Destroyer running against the Destroyer at<br>the time of the universal dissolution. Drona's heroic son, however, O<br>monarch, beholding Dhrishtadyumna stationed before him, drew deep<br>breaths, in wrath, and rushed towards him. Both of them were filled with<br>great rage at the sight of each other. Endued with great activity, the<br>valiant son of Drona then, O monarch, said these words unto<br>Dhrishtadyumna staying not far from him, "O wretch amongst the Pancalas,<br>I shall today despatch thee to Yama. The sin thou hast committed before<br>by slaying Drona will fill thee today with regret, to thy great evil, if<br>thou stayest in battle without being protected by Partha, or if thou dost<br>not fly away, O fool, I tell thee truly." Thus addressed, the valiant<br>Dhrishtadyumna replied, saying, "That same sword of mine which answered<br>thy sire, resolutely engaged in battle, will today answer this speech of<br>thine. If Drona could be slain by me, O thou that art a Brahmana in name<br>only, why should I not then, putting forth my prowess, slay thee also in<br>battle today?" Having said these words, the wrathful commander of the<br>Pandava forces, viz., the son of Prishata, pierced Drona's son with a<br>keen arrow. Then Drona's son filled with great rage, shrouded every side<br>of Dhrishtadyumna, O king, in that battle, with straight arrows. Shrouded<br>with thousands of arrows, neither the welkin, nor the points of the<br>compass, nor the combatants all around, could, O monarch, be any longer<br>seen. Similarly, the son of Prishata, O king, shrouded Drona's son, that<br>ornament of battle, with arrows, in the very sight of Karna. The son of<br>Radha, too, O monarch, singly resisted the Pancalas and the Pandavas and<br>the (five) sons of Draupadi and Yudhamanyu and the mighty car-warrior<br>Satyaki, in consequence of which feat he became the cynosure of all eyes.<br>Then Dhrishtadyumna in that battle cut off the very tough and formidable<br>bow of Drona's son, as also all his arrows resembling snakes of virulent<br>poison. Drona's son, however, with his arrows, destroyed within the<br>twinkling of an eye the bow, the dart, the mace, the standard, the<br>steeds, the driver, and the car of Prishata's son. Bowless and carless<br>and steedless and driverless, the son of Prishata then took up a huge<br>scimitar and a blazing shield decked with a hundred moons. Endued with<br>great lightness of hand, and possessed of mighty weapons, that mighty<br>car-warrior, viz., the heroic son of Drona, O king, quickly cut off, in<br>that battle, with many broad-headed arrows, those weapons also of<br>Dhrishtadyumna before the latter could come down from his car. All this<br>seemed exceedingly wonderful. The mighty car-warrior Ashvatthama,<br>however, though struggling vigorously, could not, O chief of the<br>Bharatas, slay the carless and steedless and bowless Dhrishtadyumna,<br>although pierced and exceedingly mangled with many arrows. When,<br>therefore, O king, the son of Drona found that he could not slay his<br>enemy with arrows, he laid aside his bow and quickly proceeded towards<br>the son of Prishata. The impetuosity of that high-souled one, as he<br>rushed towards his foe, resembled that of Garuda swooping down for<br>seizing a large snake. Meanwhile Madhava, addressing Arjuna, said,<br>"Behold, O Partha, how the son of Drona is rushing with great speed<br>towards the car of Prishata's son. Without doubt, he will slay the<br>prince. O mighty-armed one, O crusher of foes, rescue the son of<br>Prishata, who is now within the jaws of Drona's son as if within the jaws<br>of Death himself." Having said these words, the valiant Vasudeva urged<br>the steeds towards that spot where Drona's son was. Those steeds, of the<br>splendour of the moon, urged by Keshava, proceeded towards the car of<br>Drona's son, devouring the very skies. Beholding those two of great<br>energy, viz., Krishna and Dhananjaya, coming towards him, the mighty<br>Ashvatthama made great efforts for slaying Dhrishtadyumna soon. Seeing<br>Dhrishtadyumna dragged, O ruler of men by his enemy, the mighty Partha<br>sped many arrows at the son of Drona. Those arrows, decked with gold and<br>sped from Gandiva, approached the son of Drona and pierced him deeply<br>like snakes penetrating into an ant-hill. Thus pierced with those<br>terrible arrows, the valiant son of Drona, O king, abandoned the Pancala<br>prince of immeasurable energy. Indeed, the hero, thus afflicted with<br>Dhananjaya's shafts, mounted on his car, and taking up his own excellent<br>bow, began to pierce Partha with many shafts. Meanwhile, the heroic<br>Sahadeva, O ruler of men, bore away on his car the son of Prishata, that<br>scorcher of foes. Arjuna then, O king, pierced Drona's son with many<br>arrows. Filled with rage, Drona's son struck Arjuna in the arms and the<br>chest. Thus provoked, Partha, in that battle, sped at Drona's son, a long<br>shaft that resembled a second rod of Death, or rather, Death himself.<br>That arrow of great splendour fell upon the shoulder of the Brahmana<br>hero. Exceedingly agitated, O monarch, in that battle, by the violence of<br>the stroke, he sat down on the terrace of his car and swooned away. Then<br>Karna, O monarch, shook his bow Vijaya and, filled with rage, repeatedly<br>eyed Arjuna in that battle, desiring a single combat with him. Meanwhile<br>the driver of Drona's son, beholding the latter senseless, quickly bore<br>him away on his car from the field of battle. Beholding Prishata's son<br>rescued and Drona's son afflicted, the Pancalas, O king, expectant of<br>victory, began to utter loud shouts. Thousands of sweet instruments began<br>to be sounded. Seeing such wonderful feats in battle, the combatants<br>uttered leonine roars. Having achieved that feat, Partha addressed<br>Vasudeva, saying "Proceed, O Krishna, towards the samsaptakas, for this<br>is greatly desired by me." Hearing those words of Pandu's son, he of<br>Dasharha's race proceeded on that car graced with many banners and whose<br>speed resembled that of the wind or the mind.'"
