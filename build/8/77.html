                            "Sanjaya said, 'Hearing the roars of cars and the leonine shouts (of the<br>warriors) in battle, Arjuna addressed Govinda, saying, "Urge the steeds<br>to greater speed." Hearing these words of Arjuna, Govinda said unto him,<br>"I am proceeding with great speed to the spot where Bhima is stationed."<br>Then many lions among men (belonging to the Kaurava army), excited with<br>wrath and accompanied by a large force of cars and horse and elephants<br>and foot-soldiers and making the earth resound with the whizz of their<br>arrows, the rattle of their car wheels, and the tread of their horses'<br>hoofs, advanced against Jaya (Arjuna) as the latter proceeded for<br>victory, borne by his steeds white as snow or conchs and decked in<br>trappings of gold and pearls and gems like the chief of the celestials in<br>great wrath proceeding, armed with the thunder, against (the asura)<br>Jambha for slaying him. Between them and Partha, O sire, occurred a great<br>battle destructive of body, life, and sin, like the battle between the<br>asuras and the god Vishnu, that foremost of victors for the sake of the<br>three worlds. Alone, Partha, decked with diadem and garlands, cut off the<br>mighty weapons sped by them, as also their heads and arms in diverse<br>ways, with his razor-faced and crescent-shaped and broad-headed arrows of<br>great keenness. Umbrellas, and yak-tails for fanning, and standards, and<br>steeds, and cars, and bands of foot-soldiers, and elephants, fell down on<br>the earth, mutilated in diverse ways, like a forest broken down by a<br>tempest. Huge elephants, decked in caparisons of gold and equipped with<br>triumphal standards and warriors (on their backs), looked resplendent, as<br>they were pierced with shafts of golden wings, like mountains ablaze with<br>light. Piercing elephants and steeds and cars with excellent shafts<br>resembling Vasava's thunder, Dhananjaya proceeded quickly for the<br>slaughter of Karna, even as Indra in days of yore for riving (the asura)<br>Vala. Then that tiger among men, that mighty-armed chastiser of foes,<br>penetrated into thy host like a makara into the ocean. Beholding the son<br>of Pandu, thy warriors, O king, accompanied by cars and foot-soldiers and<br>a large number of elephants and steeds, rushed against him. Tremendous<br>was the din made by them as they advanced against Partha, resembling that<br>made by the waters of the ocean lashed into fury by the tempest. Those<br>mighty car-warriors, resembling tigers (in prowess) all rushed in that<br>battle against that tiger among men, abandoning all fear of death.<br>Arjuna, however, routed the troops of those leaders of the Kurus as they<br>advanced, shooting at him showers of weapons, like a tempest driving off<br>masses of congregated clouds. Those great bowmen, all skilled in smiting,<br>united together and proceeded against Arjuna with a large number of cars<br>and began to pierce him with keen shafts. Then Arjuna, with his shafts,<br>despatched to Yama's abode several thousands of cars and elephants and<br>steeds. While those great car-warriors in that battle were thus struck<br>with shafts sped from Arjuna's bow, they were filled with fear and seemed<br>to disappear one after another from their cars. In all, Arjuna, with his<br>sharp arrows, slew four hundred of those heroic car-warriors exerting<br>themselves vigorously in battle. Thus struck in that battle with sharp<br>shafts of diverse kinds, they fled away on all sides, avoiding Arjuna.<br>Tremendous was the uproar made at the van of the army by those warriors<br>as they broke and fled, like that made by the surging sea when it breaks<br>upon a rock. Having routed with his arrows that army struck with fright,<br>Pritha's son Arjuna then proceeded, O sire, against the division of the<br>Suta's son. Loud was the noise with which Arjuna faced his foes, like<br>that made by Garuda in days of yore when swooping down for snakes.<br>Hearing that sound, the mighty Bhimasena, desirous as he had been of<br>obtaining a sight of Partha, became filled with joy. As soon as the<br>valiant Bhimasena heard of Partha's arrival, he began, O monarch, to<br>grind thy troops, reckless of his very life. Possessed of prowess equal<br>to that of the wind, the valiant Bhima, the son of the Wind-god, began to<br>career in that battle like the wind itself. Afflicted by him, O monarch,<br>thy army, O king, began to reel like a wrecked vessel on the bosom of the<br>sea. Displaying his lightness of hands, Bhima began to cut and mangle<br>that host with his fierce arrows and despatch large numbers to the abode<br>of Yama. Beholding on that occasion the superhuman might of Bhima, O<br>Bharata, like that of the Destroyer at the end of the Yuga, thy warriors<br>became filled with fright. Seeing his mightiest soldiers thus afflicted<br>by Bhimasena, O Bharata, king Duryodhana addressed all his troops and<br>great bowmen, O bull of Bharata's race, commanding them to slay Bhima in<br>that battle, since upon Bhima's fall he would regard the Pandava troops<br>already exterminated. Accepting that command of thy son, all the kings<br>shrouded Bhima with showers of shafts from every side. Innumerable<br>elephants, O king, and men inspired with desire of victory, and cars, and<br>horse, O monarch, encompassed Vrikodara. Thus encompassed by those brave<br>warriors on all sides, O king, that hero, that chief of Bharata's race,<br>looked resplendent like the Moon surrounded by the stars. Indeed, as the<br>Moon at full within his corona looks beautiful, even so that best of men,<br>exceedingly handsome, looked beautiful in that battle. All those kings,<br>with cruel intent and eyes red in wrath, inflicted upon Vrikodara their<br>arrowy downpours, moved by the desire of slaying him. Piercing that<br>mighty host with straight shafts, Bhima came out of the press like a fish<br>coming out of a net, having slain 10,000 unretreating elephants, 200,200<br>men, O Bharata, and 5,000 horses, and a hundred car-warriors. Having<br>slaughtered these, Bhima caused a river of blood to flow there. Blood<br>constituted its water, and cars its eddies; and elephants were the<br>alligators with which it teemed. Men were its fishes, and steeds its<br>sharks, and the hair of animals formed its woods and moss. Arms lopped<br>off from trunks formed its foremost of snakes. Innumerable jewels and<br>gems were carried along by the current. Thighs constituted its gravels,<br>and marrow its mire. And it was covered with heads forming its rocks. And<br>bows and arrows constituted the rafts by which men sought to cross that<br>terrible river, and maces and spiked bludgeons formed its snakes. And<br>umbrellas and standards formed its swans, and head-gears its foam.<br>Necklaces constituted its lotuses, and the earthy dust that arose formed<br>its waves. Those endued with noble qualities could cross it with ease,<br>while those that were timid and affrighted found it exceedingly difficult<br>to cross. Warriors constituting its crocodiles and alligators, it ran<br>towards the region of Yama. Very soon, indeed, did that tiger among men<br>cause that river to flow. Even as the terrible Vaitarani is difficult of<br>being crossed by persons of unrefined souls, that bloody river, terrible<br>and enhancing the fears of the timid, was difficult to cross. Thither<br>where that best of car-warriors, the son of Pandu, penetrated, thither he<br>felled hostile warriors in hundreds and thousands. Seeing those feats<br>achieved in battle by Bhimasena, Duryodhana, O monarch, addressing<br>Shakuni, said, "Vanquish, O uncle, the mighty Bhimasena in battle. Upon<br>his defeat the mighty host of the Pandavas may be regarded as defeated."<br>Thus addressed, O monarch, the valiant son of Subala, competent to wage<br>dreadful battle, proceeded, surrounded by his brothers. Approaching in<br>that battle Bhima of terrible prowess, the heroic Shakuni checked him<br>like the continent resisting the ocean. Though resisted with keen shafts,<br>Bhima, disregarding them all, proceeded against the sons of Subala. Then<br>Shakuni, O monarch, sped a number of cloth-yard shafts equipped with<br>wings of gold and whetted on stone, at the left side of Bhima's chest.<br>Piercing through the armour of the high-souled son of Pandu, those fierce<br>shafts, O monarch, equipped with feathers of Kankas and peacocks, sunk<br>deep into his body. Deeply pierced in that battle, Bhima, O Bharata,<br>suddenly shot at Subala's son a shaft decked with gold. The mighty<br>Shakuni however, that scorcher of foes, O king, endued with great<br>lightness of hands, cut off into seven fragments that terrible arrow as<br>it coursed towards him. When his shaft fell down on the earth, Bhima, O<br>king, became highly enraged, and cut off with a broad-headed arrow the<br>bow of Subala's son with the greatest ease. The valiant son of Subala<br>then, casting aside that broken bow, quickly took up another and six and<br>ten broad-headed arrows. With two of those straight and broad-headed<br>arrows, O monarch, he struck Bhima himself, with one he cut off Bhima's<br>standard, and with two, his umbrella. With the remaining four, the son of<br>Subala pierced the four steeds of his antagonist. Filled with rage at<br>this, the valiant Bhima, O monarch, hurled in that battle a dart made of<br>iron, with its staff adorned with gold. That dart, restless as the tongue<br>of a snake, hurled from Bhima's arms, speedily fell upon the car of the<br>high-souled son of Subala. The latter then, filled with wrath, O monarch,<br>took up that same gold-decked dart and hurled it back at Bhimasena.<br>Piercing through the left arm of the high-souled son of Pandu, it fell<br>down on the earth like lightning flashed down from the sky. At this, the<br>Dhartarashtras, O monarch, set up a loud roar all around. Bhima, however,<br>could not bear that leonine roar of his foes endued with great activity.<br>The mighty son of Pandu then, quickly taking up another stringed bow, in<br>a moment, O monarch, covered with shafts the soldiers of Subala's son in<br>that battle, who were fighting reckless of their very lives. Having slain<br>his four steeds, and then his driver, O king, Bhima of great prowess next<br>cut off his antagonist's standard with a broad-headed arrow without<br>losing a moment. Abandoning with speed that steedless car, Shakuni, that<br>foremost of men, stood on the ground, with his bow ready drawn in his<br>hands, his eyes red like blood in rage, and himself breathing heavily. He<br>then, O king, struck Bhima from every side with innumerable arrows. The<br>valiant Bhima, baffling those shafts, cut off Shakuni's bow in rage and<br>pierced Shakuni himself, with many keen arrows. Deeply pierced by his<br>powerful antagonist, that scorcher of foes, O king, fell down on the<br>earth almost lifeless. Then thy son, O monarch, seeing him stupefied,<br>bore him away from battle on his car in the very sight of Bhimasena. When<br>that tiger among men, Shakuni was thus taken up on Duryodhana's car, the<br>Dhartarashtra troops, turning their faces from battle, fled away on all<br>sides inspired with fear on that occasion of great terror due to<br>Bhimasena. Upon the defeat of Subala's son, O king, by that great bowman,<br>Bhimasena, thy son Duryodhana, filled with great fright, retreated, borne<br>away by his fleet steeds, from regard for his maternal uncle's life.<br>Beholding the king himself turn away from the battle, the troops, O<br>Bharata, fled away, from the encounters in which each of them had been<br>engaged. Seeing all the Dhartarashtra troops turn away from battle and<br>fly in all directions, Bhima rushing impetuously, fell upon them,<br>shooting many hundreds of shafts. Slaughtered by Bhima, the retreating<br>Dhartarashtras, O king, approaching the spot where Karna was, once more<br>stood for battle, surrounding him. Endued with great might and great<br>energy, Karna then became their refuge. Finding Karna, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, thy troops became comforted and stood cheerfully, relying<br>upon one another, like shipwrecked mariners, O tiger of men, in their<br>distressful plight, when at last they reach an island. They then, once<br>more, making death itself their goal, proceeded against their foes for<br>battle.'"
