                            "Sanjaya said, 'Hearing that Karna of mighty energy was still alive,<br>Pritha's son Yudhishthira of immeasurable energy, exceedingly angry with<br>Phalguna and burning with the shafts of Karna, said these words unto<br>Dhananjaya, "O sire, thy army is fled and hath been beaten in a way that<br>is scarcely honourable! Inspired with fear and deserting Bhima, thou hast<br>come hither since thou hast been unable to slay Karna. Thou hast, by<br>entering her womb, rendered the conception of Kunti abortive. Thou hast<br>acted improperly by deserting Bhima, because thou wert unable to slay the<br>Suta's son. Thou hadst, O Partha, said unto me in the Dwaita woods that<br>thou wouldst, on a single car, slay Karna. Why, then, through fear of<br>Karna hast come hither, avoiding Karna and deserting Bhima? If in the<br>Dwaita woods thou hadst said unto me, 'O king, I shall not be able to<br>fight with Karna,' we would then, O Partha, have made other arrangements<br>suitable to the circumstances. Having promised me the slaughter of Karna,<br>thou hast not, O hero, kept that promise. Bringing us into the midst of<br>foes, why hast thou broken us into pieces by throwing us down on a hard<br>soil? Expecting diverse good things and benefits from thee, O Arjuna, we<br>have always uttered blessings on thee. All those expectations, however, O<br>prince, have proved vain like those of persons expectant of fruit getting<br>instead of a tree burthened only with flowers! Like a fish-hook hid<br>within a piece of meat, or poison overlaid with food, thou didst, for<br>disappointing us at last, point out destruction in the shape of kingdom<br>unto ourselves covetous of kingdom! For these thirteen years, O<br>Dhananjaya, we have, from hope, lived relying on thee, like seeds sown on<br>earth in expectation of the showers sent by the gods in season! Even<br>these were the words that a voice in the skies had said unto Pritha on<br>the seventh day after thy birth, O thou of foolish understanding! 'This<br>son of thine that is born will have the prowess of Vasava himself! He<br>will vanquish all his heroic foes! Endued with superior energy, he will<br>at Khandava vanquish all the celestials united together and diverse other<br>creatures. This one will subjugate the Madras, the Kalingas, and the<br>Kaikeyas. This one will, in the midst of many kings, slay the Kurus.<br>There will be no bowman superior to him, and no creature will ever be<br>able to vanquish him. With his senses under control, and having obtained<br>mastery over all branches of knowledge, this one, by merely desiring it,<br>will bring all creatures under subjection to himself. This high-souled<br>son that is born of thee, O Kunti, will in beauty be the rival of Soma,<br>in speed of the god of wind, in patience of Meru, in forgiveness of<br>Earth, in splendour of Surya, in prosperity of the Lord of treasures, in<br>courage of Sakra, and in might of Vishnu. He will be the slayer of all<br>foes like Vishnu, the son of Aditi. Endued with immeasurable energy, he<br>will be celebrated for the destruction he will deal to foes and the<br>success he will win for friends. He will, besides, be the founder of a<br>race!' Even thus, in the skies, on the summit of the Satasringa<br>mountains, in the hearing of many ascetics, that voice spoke. All that,<br>however, hath not come to pass. Alas, it shows that the gods even may<br>speak untruths! Hearing also the words of praise always uttered about<br>thee by many foremost of Rishis, I never expected that Suyodhana would<br>win success and prosperity or that thou thyself wouldst be afflicted with<br>the fear of Karna! Thou ridest upon an excellent car constructed by the<br>celestial artificer himself, with axles that do not creak, and with<br>standard that bears the ape. Thou bearest a sword attached to thy belt of<br>gold and silk. This thy bow Gandiva is full six cubits long. Thou hast<br>Keshava for thy driver. Why, then, through fear of Karna hast thou come<br>away from battle, O Partha? If, O thou of wicked soul, thou hadst given<br>this bow to Keshava and become his driver, then Keshava could have (by<br>this time) slain the fierce Karna like the lord of the Maruts (Sakra)<br>slaying with his thunder the Asura Vritra. If thou art unable to resist<br>the fierce son of Radha today, as he is careering in battle, give this<br>thy Gandiva today to some other king, that may be thy superior in (the<br>use and knowledge of) weapons. If that be done, the world will not then<br>behold us bereft of sons and wives, deprived of happiness in consequence<br>of the loss of kingdom, and sunk, O son of Pandu, in an unfathomable hell<br>of great misery. It would have been better for thee if thou hadst never<br>been born in the womb of Kunti, or having taken thy birth there, if thou<br>hadst come out on the fifth month an abortion, than to have, O prince,<br>thus come away from battle, O thou of wicked soul! Fie on thy Gandiva,<br>fie on the might of thy arms, fie on thy inexhaustible arrows! Fie on thy<br>banner with the gigantic ape on it, and fie on thy car given thee by the<br>god of fire!"'"
