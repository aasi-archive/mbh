                            "Sanjaya said, 'Fighting fiercely, prince Duhshasana achieved the most<br>difficult feats in that encounter. With a single shaft he cut off Bhima's<br>bow, and then with six shafts he pierced his foe's driver. Having<br>achieved those feats, the prince, endued with great activity, pierced<br>Bhima himself with nine shafts. Indeed the high-souled warrior, without<br>losing a moment, then pierced Bhimasena with many shafts of great energy.<br>Filled with rage at this, Bhimasena, endued with great activity, sped at<br>thy son a fierce dart. Beholding that terrible dart impetuously coursing<br>towards him like a blazing brand, thy high-souled son cut it off with ten<br>shafts shot from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch. Seeing that<br>difficult feat achieved by him, all the warriors, filled with joy,<br>applauded him highly. Thy son then once more pierced Bhima deeply with<br>another shaft. Blazing with wrath at sight of Duhshasana, Bhima then<br>addressed him, saying, "Pierced I have been, O hero, quickly and deeply,<br>by thee. Bear now, however, once more, the stroke of my mace." Having<br>said this, the enraged Bhima took up that terrible mace of his for<br>Duhshasana's slaughter. Once more addressing him, he said, "O thou of<br>wicked soul, I shall today drink thy blood on the field of battle." Thus<br>addressed, thy son sped at Bhima with great force a fierce dart<br>resembling Death itself. Bhima also, his form filled with wrath, whirled<br>his terrible mace and hurled it at his antagonist. That mace,<br>precipitately breaking Duhshasana's dart, struck thy son on his head.<br>Indeed, perspiring like an elephant with juicy secretions trickling down<br>his body, Bhima, in that dreadful battle, hurled his mace at the prince.<br>With that weapon, Bhimasena forcibly threw Duhshasana down from his car<br>at a distance measured by the length of ten bows. Struck with the<br>impetuous mace, Duhshasana, thrown down on the ground, began to tremble.<br>All his steeds also, O king, were slain, and his car too was reduced to<br>atoms by that falling weapon. As regards Duhshasana himself, his armour<br>and ornaments and attire and garlands were all displaced, and he began to<br>writhe, afflicted with agony. Endued with great activity, Bhimasena then<br>recollected, in the midst of that terrible battle and standing as he did<br>amid many foremost warriors of the Kuru army, all the acts of hostility<br>(done towards the Pandavas) by thy sons. The mighty-armed Bhima of<br>inconceivable feats, O king, beholding Duhshasana (in that plight), and<br>recollecting the seizure of Draupadi's tresses and her disrobing while<br>she was ill,&#8212;indeed, the innocent Bhima, reflecting also upon the<br>diverse other wrongs inflicted on that princess while her husbands sat<br>with faces turned away from the scene, blazed up in wrath like fire fed<br>with libations of clarified butter. Addressing Karna and Suyodhana and<br>Kripa and Drona's son and Kritavarma, he said, "Today I shall slay the<br>wretched Duhshasana. Let all the warriors protect him (if they can)."<br>Having said this, Bhima of exceeding strength and great activity suddenly<br>rushed, from desire of slaying Duhshasana. Like a lion of fierce<br>impetuosity rushing towards a mighty elephant, Vrikodara, that foremost<br>of heroes, rushed towards Duhshasana in that battle and attacked him in<br>the very sight of Suyodhana and Karna. Jumping down from his car, he<br>alighted on the ground, and fixed his eyes steadfastly on his fallen foe.<br>Drawing then his whetted sword of keen edge, and trembling with rage, he<br>placed his foot upon the throat of Duhshasana, and ripping open the<br>breast of his enemy stretched on the ground, quaffed his warm life-blood.<br>Then throwing him down and cutting off, O king, with that sword the head<br>of thy son, Bhima of great intelligence, desirous of accomplishing his<br>vow, again quaffed his enemy's blood little by little, as if for enjoying<br>its taste. Then looking at him with wrathful eyes, he said these words,<br>"I regard the taste of this blood of my enemy to be superior to that of<br>my mother's milk, or honey, or clarified butter, or good wine that is<br>prepared from honey, or excellent water, or milk, or curds, or skimmed<br>milk, or all other kinds of drinks there are on earth that are sweet as<br>ambrosia or nectar." Once more, Bhima of fierce deeds, his heart filled<br>with wrath, beholding Duhshasana dead, laughed softly and said, "What<br>more can I do to thee? Death has rescued thee from my hands." They, O<br>king, that saw Bhimasena, while he filled with joy at having quaffed the<br>blood of his foe, was uttering those words and stalking on the field of<br>battle, fell down in fear. They that did not fall down at the sight, saw<br>their weapons drop from their hands. Many, from fear, cried out feebly<br>and looked at Bhima with half-shut eyes. Indeed, all those that stood<br>around Bhima and beheld him drink the blood of Duhshasana, fled away,<br>overwhelmed with fear, and saying unto one another, "This one is no human<br>being!" When Bhima had assumed that form, people, beholding him quaff his<br>enemy's blood, fled away with Citrasena, saying unto one another, 'This<br>Bhima must be a rakshasa!" Then the (Pancala) prince Yudhamanyu, at the<br>head of his troops, fearlessly pursued the retreating Citrasena and<br>pierced him with seven keen shafts, quickly sped one after another. At<br>this, like a trampled snake of great energy repeatedly darting out its<br>tongue and desirous of vomiting its poison, Citrasena turned back and<br>pierced the Pancala prince with three shafts and his driver with six. The<br>brave Yudhamanyu then struck off his enemy's head with a shaft equipped<br>with goodly wings and an exceedingly keen point and sped with great care<br>from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch. Upon the fall of his brother<br>Citrasena, Karna, filled with wrath and displaying his prowess, put the<br>Pandava host to flight, at which Nakula rushed against that warrior of<br>immeasurable energy. Bhima, having slain there (at the very sight of<br>Karna) the vindictive Duhshasana, took up a little quantity of his blood,<br>and, endued with stentorian lungs, he said these words in the hearing of<br>all those foremost of heroes of the world, "O wretch amongst men, here I<br>drink thy life-blood from thy throat. Filled with joy, abuse us once<br>more, saying 'beast, beast' (as thou didst before)." And he continued,<br>"They that danced at us then, saying, 'beast, beast,' even we will dance<br>at them now, repeating their own words. Our sleep at the palace at<br>Pramanakoti, the administration of deadly poison to our food, the bites<br>of black cobras, the setting fire to the house of lac, the robbing of our<br>kingdom by gambling, our exile in the woods, the cruel seizure of<br>Draupadi's beautiful tresses, the strokes of shafts and weapons in<br>battle, our miseries at home, the other kinds of sufferings we endured at<br>Virata's abode, all these woes borne by us through the counsels of<br>Shakuni and Duryodhana and Radha's son, proceeded from thee as their<br>cause. Through the wickedness of Dhritarashtra and his son, we have<br>endured all these woes. Happiness has never been ours." Having said these<br>words, O king, the victorious Vrikodara, once more spoke these words unto<br>Keshava and Arjuna. Indeed, bathed in blood, with blood flowing from his<br>wounds, with face exceedingly red, filled with great wrath, Bhimasena<br>endued with great activity, said these words, "Ye heroes, that which I<br>had vowed in respect of Duhshasana in battle, I have accomplished today.<br>I will soon accomplish my other vow by slaying that second beast, viz.,<br>Duryodhana, in this sacrifice of battle. Striking the head of that<br>wicked-souled one with my foot in the presence of the Kauravas, I shall<br>obtain peace." Having said these words, Bhima, filled with great joy,<br>drenched with blood, uttered loud shouts, even as the mighty and<br>high-souled Indra of a 1,000 eyes had roared after slaying (the Asura)<br>Vritra.'"
