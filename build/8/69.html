                            "Sanjaya said, 'Thus addressed by Yudhishthira, Kunti's son owning white<br>steeds, filled with rage, drew his sword for slaying that bull of<br>Bharata's race. Beholding his wrath, Keshava, conversant with the<br>workings of the (human) heart said, "Why, O Partha, dost thou draw thy<br>sword? I do not, O Dhananjaya, behold anyone here with whom thou hast to<br>fight! The Dhartarashtras have now been assailed by the intelligent<br>Bhimasena. Thou comest from battle, O son of Kunti, for seeing the king.<br>The king has been seen by thee. Indeed, Yudhishthira is well. Having seen<br>that tiger among kings who is endued with prowess equal to that of a<br>tiger, why this folly at a time when thou shouldst rejoice? I do not see<br>here, O son of Kunti, the person whom thou mayst slay. Why then dost thou<br>desire to strike? What is this delusion of thy mind? Why dost thou, with<br>such speed, take up that formidable sword? I ask thee this, O son, of<br>Kunti! What is this that thou art about, inasmuch as, O thou of<br>inconceivable prowess, thou graspest that sword in anger?" Thus addressed<br>by Krishna, Arjuna, casting his eyes on Yudhishthira, and breathing like<br>an angry snake, said unto Govinda, "I would cut off the head of that man<br>who would tell me 'Give thy Gandiva to another person." Even this is my<br>secret vow. Those words have been spoken by this king, O thou of<br>immeasurable prowess, in thy presence, O Govinda! I dare not forgive<br>them. I will for that slay this king who himself fears the slightest<br>falling from virtue. Slaying this best of men, I will keep my vow. It is<br>for this that I have drawn the sword, O delighter of the Yadus. Even I,<br>slaying Yudhishthira, will pay off my debt to truth. By that I will<br>dispel my grief and fever, O Janardana. I ask thee, what do you think<br>suitable to the circumstances that have arisen? Thou, O sire, knowest the<br>entire past and future of this universe. I will do what thou wilt tell<br>me.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Govinda then said, "Fie, fie," unto Partha and once<br>more continued to say, "I now know, O Partha, that thou hast not waited<br>upon the old, since, O tiger among men, thou hast yielded to wrath at a<br>time when thou shouldst not have done so. No one that is acquainted with<br>the distinctions of morality would act in the way, O Dhananjaya, in which<br>thou, O son of Pandu, that art unacquainted with them, art acting today!<br>He, O Partha, is the worst of men who committeth acts that should not be<br>done and doeth acts that are apparently proper but condemned by the<br>scriptures. Thou knowest not the decisions of those learned men who,<br>waited upon by pupils, declare their opinions, following the dictates of<br>morality. The man that is not acquainted with those rulings becomes<br>confounded and stupefied, O Partha, even as thou hast been stupefied, in<br>discriminating between what should be done and what should not. What<br>should be done and what should not cannot be ascertained easily.<br>Everything can be ascertained by the aid of the scriptures. Thou,<br>however, art not acquainted with the scriptures. Since (believing<br>thyself) conversant with morality, thou art desirous of observing<br>morality (in this way, it seems) thou art actuated by ignorance. Thou<br>believest thyself to be conversant with virtue, but thou dost not know, O<br>Partha, that the slaughter of living creatures is a sin. Abstention from<br>injury to animals is, I think, the highest virtue. One may even speak an<br>untruth, but one should never kill. How then, O foremost of men, couldst<br>thou wish, like an ordinary person, to slay thy eldest brother, the King,<br>who is conversant with morality? The slaughter of a person not engaged in<br>battle, or of a foe, O Bharata who has turned his face from battle or who<br>flies away or seeks protection or joins his hands or yields himself up or<br>is careless, is never applauded by the righteous. All these attributes<br>are in thy superior. This vow, O Partha, was adopted by thee before from<br>foolishness. In consequence of that vow thou art now, from folly,<br>desirous of perpetrating a sinful act. Why, O Partha, dost thou rush<br>towards thy reverend superior for slaying him, without having resolved<br>the exceedingly subtle course of morality that is, again, difficult of<br>being understood? I will now tell thee, O son of Pandu, this mystery<br>connected with morality, this mystery that was declared by Bhishma, by<br>the righteous Yudhishthira, by Vidura otherwise called Kshatri, and by<br>Kunti, of great celebrity. I will tell thee that mystery in all its<br>details. Listen to it, O Dhananjaya! One who speaks truth is righteous.<br>There is nothing higher than truth. Behold, however, truth as practised<br>is exceedingly difficult to be understood as regards its essential<br>attributes. Truth may be unutterable, and even falsehood may be utterable<br>where falsehood would become truth and truth would become falsehood. In a<br>situation of peril to life and in marriage, falsehood becomes utterable.<br>In a situation involving the loss of one's entire property, falsehood<br>becomes utterable. On an occasion of marriage, or of enjoying a woman, or<br>when life is in danger, or when one's entire property is about to be<br>taken away, or for the sake of a Brahmana, falsehood may be uttered.<br>These five kinds of falsehood have been declared to be sinless. On these<br>occasions falsehood would become truth and truth would become falsehood.<br>He is a fool that practises truth without knowing the difference between<br>truth and falsehood. One is said to be conversant with morality when one<br>is able to distinguish between truth and falsehood. What wonder then in<br>this that a man of wisdom, by perpetrating even a cruel act, may obtain<br>great merit like Valaka by the slaughter of the blind beast? What wonder,<br>again, in this that a foolish and ignorant person, from even the desire<br>of winning merit, earns great sin like Kausika (living) among the rivers?"<br><br>"'Arjuna said, "Tell me, O holy one, this story that I may understand it,<br>viz., this illustration about Valaka and about Kausika (living) among<br>rivers."<br><br>"'Vasudeva said, "There was a certain hunter of animals, O Bharata, of<br>the name of Valaka. He used, for the livelihood of his son and wives and<br>not from will, to slay animals. Devoted to the duties of his own order<br>and always speaking the truth and never harbouring malice, he used also<br>to support his parents and others that depended upon him. One day,<br>searching for animals even with perseverance and care, he found none. At<br>last he saw a beast of prey whose sense of smell supplied the defect of<br>his eyes, employed in drinking water. Although he had never seen such an<br>animal before, still he slew it immediately. After the slaughter of that<br>blind beast, a floral shower fell from the skies (upon the head of the<br>hunter). A celestial car also, exceedingly delightful and resounding with<br>the songs of Apsaras and the music of their instruments, came from heaven<br>for taking away that hunter of animals. That beast of prey, having<br>undergone ascetic austerities, had obtained a boon and had become the<br>cause of the destruction of all creatures. For this reason he was made<br>blind by the Self-born. Having slain that animal which had resolved to<br>slay all creatures, Valaka went to heaven. Morality is even so difficult<br>of being understood. There was an ascetic of the name of Kausika without<br>much knowledge of the scriptures. He lived in a spot much removed from a<br>village, at a point where many rivers met. He made a vow, saying, 'I must<br>always speak the truth.' He then became celebrated, O Dhananjaya, as a<br>speaker of truth. At that time certain persons, from fear of robbers,<br>entered that wood (where Kausika dwelt). Thither even, the robbers,<br>filled with rage, searched for them carefully. Approaching Kausika then,<br>that speaker of truth, they asked him saying, 'O holy one, by which path<br>have a multitude of men gone a little while before? Asked in the name of<br>Truth, answer us. If thou hast seen them, tell us this'. Thus adjured,<br>Kausika told them the truth, saying, 'Those men have entered this wood<br>crowded with many trees and creepers and plants'. Even thus, O Partha,<br>did Kausika give them the information. Then those cruel men, it is heard,<br>finding out the persons they sought, slew them all. In consequence of<br>that great sin consisting in the words spoken, Kausika, ignorant of the<br>subtilities of morality, fell into a grievous hell, even as a foolish<br>man, of little knowledge, and unacquainted with the distinctions of<br>morality, falleth into painful hell by not having asked persons of age<br>for the solution of his doubts. There must be some indications for<br>distinguishing virtue from sin. Sometimes that high and unattainable<br>knowledge may be had by the exercise of reason. Many persons say, on the<br>one hand, that the scriptures indicate morality. I do not contradict<br>this. The scriptures, however, do not provide for every case. For the<br>growth of creatures have precepts of morality been declared. That which<br>is connected with inoffensiveness is religion. Dharma protects and<br>preserves the people. So it is the conclusion of the Pandits that what<br>maintains is Dharma. O Partha, I have narrated to you the signs and<br>indications of Dharma. Hearing this, you decide whether Yudhishthira is<br>to be slaughtered by you or not." Arjuna said, "Krishna, your words are<br>fraught with great intelligence and impregnated with wisdom. Thou art to<br>us like our parents and our refuge. Nothing is unknown to thee in the<br>three worlds, so thou art conversant with the canons of morality. O<br>Keshava of the Vrishni clan, thou knowest my vow that whoever among men<br>would tell me, 'Partha, give thy Gandiva to some one braver than you,' I<br>shall at once put an end to his life. Bhima has also made a promise that<br>whoever would call him 'tularak', would be slaughtered by him there and<br>then. Now the King has repeatedly used those very words to me in thy<br>presence, O hero, viz., 'Give thy bow.' If I slay him, O Keshava, I will<br>not be able to live in this world for even a moment. Having intended<br>again the slaughter of the king through folly and the loss of my mental<br>faculties, I have been polluted by sin. It behoveth thee today, O<br>foremost of all righteous persons, to give me such counsel that my vow,<br>known throughout the world, may become true while at the same time both<br>myself and the eldest son of Pandu may live.'"<br><br>"'Vasudeva said, "The king was fatigued, and under the influence of<br>grief, He had been mangled in battle by Karna with numerous arrows. After<br>that, O hero, he was repeatedly struck by the Suta's son (with his<br>shafts), while he was retreating from battle. It was for this that,<br>labouring under a load of sorrow, he spoke those improper words unto thee<br>in wrath. He provoked thee by those words so that thou mightest slay<br>Karna in battle. The son of Pandu knows that the wretched Karna is<br>incapable of being borne by any one else in the world (save thee). It was<br>for this, O Partha, that the king in great wrath said those harsh words<br>to thy face. The stake in the game of today's battle has been made to lie<br>in the ever alert and always unbearable Karna. That Karna being slain,<br>the Kauravas would necessarily be vanquished. Even this is what the royal<br>son of Dharma had thought. For this the son of Dharma does not deserve<br>death. Thy vow also, O Arjuna, should be kept. Listen now to my counsels<br>that will be agreeable to thee, to counsels in consequence of which<br>Yudhishthira without being actually deprived of life may yet be dead. As<br>long as one that is deserving of respect continues to receive respect,<br>one is said to live in the world of men. When, however, such a person<br>meets with disrespect, he is spoken of as one that is dead though alive.<br>This king hath always been respected by thee and by Bhima and the twins,<br>as also by all heroes and all persons in the world that are venerable for<br>years. In some trifle then show him disrespect. Therefore, O Partha,<br>address this Yudhishthira as 'thou' when his usual form of address is<br>'your honour.' A superior, O Bharata, by being addressed as 'thou,' is<br>killed though not deprived of life. Bear thyself thus, O son of Kunti,<br>towards king Yudhishthira, the just. Adopt this censurable behaviour, O<br>perpetuator of Kuru's race! This best audition of all auditions, hath<br>been declared by both Atharvan and Angiras. Men desiring good should<br>always act in this way without scruples of any kind. Without being<br>deprived of life a superior is yet said to be killed if that venerable<br>one is addressed as 'thou.' Conversant with duty as thou art, address<br>king Yudhishthira the just, in the manner I have indicated. This death, O<br>son of Pandu, at thy hands, king Yudhishthira will never regard as an<br>offence committed by thee. Having addressed him in this way, thou mayst<br>then worship his feet and speak words of respect unto this son of Pritha<br>and soothe his wounded honour. Thy brother is wise. The royal son of<br>Pandu, therefore, will never be angry with thee. Freed from falsehood as<br>also from fratricide, thou wilt then, O Partha, cheerfully slay the<br>Suta's son Karna!"'"
