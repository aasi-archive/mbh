                            "'Duryodhana said, "Even thus did that illustrious Deity, that Grandsire<br>of all the worlds, viz., Brahman, act as driver on that occasion and even<br>thus did Rudra become the warrior. The driver of the car, O hero, should<br>be superior to the warrior on it. Therefore, O tiger among men, do thou<br>hold the reins of the steeds in this battle. As on that occasion the<br>Grandsire had been selected with care by all the celestials, indeed, O<br>great king, as one greater than Sankara, so thou that art superior to<br>Karna art now selected by us with care. Like the Grandsire holding the<br>reins of Rudra's steeds, do thou hold, without delay, the reins of<br>Karna's steeds in battle, O thou of great splendour."<br><br>"'Shalya said, "O foremost of men, many a time have I heard this<br>excellent and celestial history, recited to me, of those two lions among<br>gods. Indeed, I have heard how the Grandsire acted as the driver of Bhava<br>and how the Asuras also, O Bharata, were all destroyed with one shaft.<br>Krishna also had knowledge of all this before, the knowledge, viz., of<br>how the illustrious Grandsire had become the driver on that occasion of<br>yore. Indeed, Krishna knoweth the past and the future with all their<br>details. Knowing this fact, he became the driver, O Bharata, of Partha<br>like the Self-create becoming the driver of Rudra. If the Suta's son, by<br>some means, succeeds in slaying the son of Kunti, Keshava, beholding<br>Partha slain, will fight himself. That bearer of the conch, the discus,<br>and the mace, will then consume thy army. There is no king here that will<br>stay in the ranks in front of that illustrious one of Vrishni's race when<br>he will be excited with wrath.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Unto the ruler of the Madras who was speaking in that<br>strain, that chastiser of foes, viz., thy mighty-armed son of cheerful<br>soul replied, saying, "Do not, O mighty-armed one, think disparagingly of<br>Karna, otherwise called Vaikartana, in battle,&#8212;that warrior who is the<br>foremost of all wielders of arms and who is acquainted with the meaning<br>of the whole body of our scriptures. Hearing the terrible and loud twang<br>of his bow and the sound of his palms, the Pandava troops fly away on all<br>sides. Thou hast witnessed it with thy own eyes, O mighty-armed one, how<br>Ghatotkaca, screened by his illusions and displaying hundreds of still<br>slain that night (by Karna). Feeling a great fear all these days Vibhatsu<br>could never stand, fronting Karna. The mighty Bhimasena also, moved<br>hither and thither by the horn of Karna's bow, was, O king, addressed in<br>very harsh words such as 'Fool' and 'Glutton.' The two brave sons of<br>Madri also were defeated by Karna in great battle, though, from some<br>object he had in view, he did not, O sire, slay them then. That foremost<br>one of Vrishni's race, viz., the heroic Satyaki, the chief of the Satwata<br>clan, was vanquished by Karna and made carless. Others, such as all the<br>Srinjayas headed by Dhrishtadyumna, have been repeatedly defeated in<br>battle by Karna the great car-warrior who has achieved all these feats<br>and who excited with wrath, is competent to slay Purandara himself armed<br>with the thunderbolt in fight. Thyself also, O hero, art acquainted with<br>every weapon. Thou art, again, the master of all branches of learning.<br>There is none on Earth who is thy equal in might of arms. Irresistible in<br>prowess, thou art like a dart (Shalya) unto thy enemies. It is for this,<br>O king, that thou O slayer of foes, art called 'Shalya.' Encountering the<br>might of thy arms, all the Satwatas were unable to get the better of it.<br>Is Krishna superior to thee in might of arms, O king? Indeed, as Krishna<br>is to bear the burthen of the Pandava troops upon the slaughter of<br>Partha, even so art thou to bear the burthen of this vast (Kaurava) force<br>if Karna lays down his life. Why should he be able to resist my troops<br>and why shouldst not thou be able to slay the hostile troops, O sire? For<br>thy sake, O sire, I would willingly follow the footsteps of my (slain)<br>brothers and the other heroic kings of the Earth."<br><br>"'Shalya said, "O son of Gandhari, when thou, O giver of honours,<br>describest me before thy troops to be superior to the son of Devaki, I am<br>exceedingly gratified with thee. I accept the drivership of the<br>celebrated son of Radha when he will fight with that foremost of the sons<br>of Pandu, as thou desirest. I have, however, O hero, a compact to make<br>with Vaikartana, and that is this: I will utter whatever words I may<br>wish, in this one's presence.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thy son then, O king, with Karna, O sire, answered<br>the ruler of the Madras, saying, "Let it be so" in the presence of all<br>the kshatriyas. Assured by Shalya's acceptance of the drivership,<br>Duryodhana, filled with joy, embraced Karna. Eulogised (by bards and<br>panegyrists around), thy son then once more addressed Karna, saying,<br>"Slay all the Parthas in battle, like the great Indra slaying the<br>Danavas." Shalya having accepted the office of holding the reins of his<br>steeds, Karna, with a cheerful heart, once more addressed Duryodhana,<br>saying, "The ruler of the Madras does not say very cheerfully what he<br>says. O king, solicit him once more in sweet words." Thus addressed, the<br>mighty king Duryodhana, possessed of great wisdom and accomplished in<br>everything, once more spoke unto that lord of Earth, viz., Shalya, the<br>ruler of Madras, in a voice deep as that of the clouds and filling the<br>whole region there with the sound of that voice: "O Shalya, Karna thinks<br>that he should fight with Arjuna today. O tiger among men hold the reins<br>of Karna's steeds in battle. Having slain all the other warriors Karna<br>desires to slay Phalguna. I solicit thee, O king, repeatedly, in the<br>matter of holding the reins of his steeds. As Krishna, that foremost of<br>all drivers, is the counsellor of Partha, even so do thou protect the son<br>of Radha today from every danger.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Embracing thy son then, Shalya the ruler of the<br>Madras, joyfully answered that slayer of foes, viz., Duryodhana, saying,<br>"If this is what is thou thinkest, O royal son of Gandhari, O thou of<br>handsome features, I shall, for that, accomplish everything that may be<br>agreeable to thee. O chief of the Bharatas, for whatever acts I may be<br>fit, employing myself therein with my whole heart, I will bear the<br>burthen of those acts of thine. Let Karna, however, and thyself pardon me<br>all those words, agreeable or disagreeable, that I may speak unto Karna<br>from desire of his good.'"<br><br>"'Karna said, "O ruler of the Madras, be thou ever engaged in our good as<br>Brahman in that of Ishana, as Keshava in that of Partha."<br><br>"'Shalya said, "These four kinds of conduct&#8212;self-rebuke and self-praise,<br>speaking ill of others, and adulation of others, are never practised by<br>those that are respectable. That, however, O learned one, which I shall<br>say, for inspiring thy confidence is fraught with self-adulation. For all<br>that, listen to it duly. O puissant one, like Matali himself, I am fit to<br>act as the driver of even Indra in watchfulness, in managing the steeds,<br>in knowledge of coming danger and of the means of avoiding it, and in<br>competence to avoid it in practice. When thou wilt be engaged in battle<br>with Partha, I will hold the reins of thy steeds. Let thy anxiety be<br>dispelled, O Suta's son."'"
