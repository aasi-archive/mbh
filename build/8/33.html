                            "'Duryodhana said, "Listen, once more, O ruler of the Madras, to what I<br>will say unto thee, about what happened, O lord, in the battle between<br>the gods and the Asuras in days of yore. The great rishi Markandeya<br>narrated it to my sire. I will now recite it without leaving out<br>anything, O best of royal sages. Listen to that account confidingly and<br>without mistrusting it at all. Between the gods and the Asuras, each<br>desirous of vanquishing the other, there happened a great battle, O king,<br>which had Taraka for its evil (root). It hath been heard by us that the<br>Daityas were defeated by the gods. Upon the defeat of the Daityas, the<br>three sons of Taraka, named Tarakaksha, Kamalaksha and Vidyunmalin, O<br>king, practising the austerest penances, lived in the observance of high<br>vows. By those penances they emaciated their bodies, O scorcher of foes.<br>In consequence of their self-restraint, their penances, their vows and<br>contemplation, the boongiving Grandsire became gratified with them and<br>gave them boons. Unitedly they solicited the Grandsire of all the worlds,<br>O king, for the boon of immunity from death at the hands of all Creatures<br>of all times. The divine Lord and Master of all the worlds said unto<br>them, 'There is nothing like immunity from death at the hands of all<br>creatures. Therefore, ye Asuras, abstain from such a prayer. Solicit some<br>other boon that may seem desirable to you.' When all of them, O king,<br>having settled it amongst themselves after long and repeated conferences,<br>bowed to the great Master of all the worlds and said these words, 'O god,<br>O Grandsire, give us this boon. Residing in three cities, we will rove<br>over this Earth, with thy grace ever before us. After a 1,000 years then,<br>we will come together, and our three cities also, O sinless one, will<br>become united into one. That foremost one amongst the gods who will, with<br>one shaft, pierce those three cities united into one, will, O lord, be<br>the cause of our destruction.' Saying unto them, 'Let it be so,' that god<br>ascended to heaven. Those Asuras then, filled with joy at having obtained<br>those boons and having settled it among themselves about the construction<br>of the three cities, selected for the purpose the great Asura Maya, the<br>celestial artificer, knowing no fatigue or decay, and worshipped by all<br>the daityas and danavas. Then Maya, of great intelligence, by the aid of<br>his own ascetic merit, constructed three cities, one of which was of<br>gold, another of silver, and the third of black iron. The golden city was<br>set in heaven, the silver city in the welkin, and the iron city was set<br>on the Earth, all in such a way as to revolve in a circle, O lord of<br>Earth. Each of those cities measured a hundred yojanas in breadth and a<br>hundred in length. And they consisted of houses and mansions and lofty<br>walls and porches. And though teeming with lordly palaces close to each<br>other, yet the streets were wide and spacious. And they were adorned with<br>diverse mansions and gate-ways. Each of those cities, again, O monarch,<br>had a separate king. The beautiful city of gold belonged to the<br>illustrious Tarakaksha: the silver city to Kamalaksha, and the iron one<br>to Vidyunmalin. Those three Daitya kings, soon assailing the three worlds<br>with their energy, continued to dwell and reign, and began to say, 'Who<br>is he called the Creator?' Unto those foremost of Danavas having no<br>heroes equal to them, came from every side millions upon millions, of<br>proud and flesh-eating Danavas who had before been defeated by the<br>celestials, and who now settled in the three cities, desirous of great<br>prosperity. Unto all of them thus united, Maya became the supplier of<br>every thing they wanted. Relying upon him, all of them resided there, in<br>perfect fearlessness. Whoever amongst those residing in the triple city<br>wished for any object in his heart had his wish fulfilled by Maya aided<br>by the latter's powers of illusion. Tarakaksha had a heroic and mighty<br>son named Hari. He underwent the austerest of penances, upon which the<br>Grandsire became gratified with him. When the god was gratified, Hari<br>solicited a boon of him, saying, 'Let a lake start into existence in our<br>city, such that persons, slain by means of weapons, may, when thrown into<br>it, come out with life, and with redoubled strength.' Obtaining this<br>boon, the heroic Hari, son of Tarakaksha, created a lake, O lord, in his<br>city, that was capable of reviving the dead. In whatever form and<br>whatever guise a Daitya might have been slain, if thrown into that lake,<br>he was restored to life, in the self-same form and guise. Obtaining alive<br>the slain among them, the Daityas began to afflict the three worlds.<br>Crowned with success by means of austere penances, those enhancers of the<br>fears of the gods sustained, O king, no diminution in battle. Stupefied<br>then by covetousness and folly, and deprived of their senses, all of them<br>began to shamelessly exterminate the cities and towns established all<br>over the universe. Filled with pride at the boons they had received, and<br>driving before them, at all times and from all places, the gods with<br>their attendants, they roamed at will over celestial forests and other<br>realms dear to the denizens of heaven and the delightful and sacred<br>asylums of rishis. And the wicked Danavas ceased to show any respect for<br>anybody. While the worlds were thus afflicted, Sakra, surrounded by the<br>Maruts, battled against the three cities by hurling his thunder upon them<br>from every side. When, however, Purandra failed to pierce those cities<br>made impenetrable, O king, by the Creator with his boons, the chief of<br>celestials, filled with fear, and leaving those cities, repaired with<br>those very gods to that chastiser of foes, viz., the Grandsire, for<br>representing unto him the oppressions committed by the Asuras.<br>Representing everything and bowing with their heads unto him, they asked<br>the divine Grandsire the means by which the triple city could be<br>destroyed. The illustrious Deity, hearing the words of Indra, told the<br>gods, 'He that is an offender against you offends against me also. The<br>Asuras are all of wicked souls and always hate the gods. They that give<br>pain to you always offend against me. I am impartial to all creatures.<br>There is no doubt in this. For all that, however, they that are<br>unrighteous should be slain. This is my fixed vow. Those three forts are<br>to be pierced with one shaft. By no other means can their destruction be<br>effected. None else, save Sthanu, is competent to pierce them with one<br>shaft. Ye Adityas, select Sthanu, otherwise called Ishana and Jishnu, who<br>is never fatigued with work, as your warrior. It is he that will destroy<br>those asuras.' Hearing these words of his, the gods with Sakra at their<br>head, making Brahman take their lead, sought the protection of the Deity<br>having the bull for his mark. Those righteous ones accompanied by rishis<br>devoted to the severest penances and uttering the eternal words of the<br>Vedas, sought Bhava with their whole soul. And they praised, O king, in<br>the high words of the Vedas, that dispeller of fears in all situations of<br>fear that Universal Soul, that Supreme Soul, that One by whom All this is<br>pervaded with his Soul. Then the gods who, by special penances, had<br>learnt to still all the functions of his Soul and to withdraw Soul from<br>Matter,&#8212;they who had their soul always under control&#8212;beheld him, called<br>Ishana,&#8212;that lord of Uma, that mass of energy, that is, who hath no<br>equal in the universe, that source (of everything), that sinless Self.<br>Though that Deity is one they had imagined him to be of various forms.<br>Beholding in that high-souled one those diverse forms that each had<br>individually conceived in own heart, all of them became filled with<br>wonder. Beholding that Unborn one, that Lord of the universe, to be the<br>embodiment of all creatures, the gods and the regenerate Rishis, all<br>touched the Earth with their heads. Saluting them with the word 'Welcome'<br>and raising them from their bent attitudes, the illustrious Sankara<br>addressed them smilingly, saying, 'Tell us the object of your visit.'<br>Commanded by the Three-eyed god, their hearts became easy. They then said<br>these words unto him, 'Our repeated salutations to thee, O Lord.<br>Salutations to thee that art the source of all the gods, to thee that art<br>armed with the bow, to thee that art full of wrath. Salutations to thee<br>that hadst destroyed the sacrifice of that lord of creatures (viz.,<br>Daksha) to thee that art adored by all the lords of creatures.<br>Salutations to thee that art always praised, to thee that deservest to be<br>praised, to thee that art Death's self. Salutations to thee that art red,<br>to thee that art fierce, to thee that art blue-throated, to thee that art<br>armed with the trident, to thee that art incapable of being baffled, to<br>thee that hast eyes as beautiful as those of the gazelle, to thee that<br>fightest with the foremost of weapons, to thee that deservest all praise,<br>to thee that art pure, to thee that art destruction's self, to thee that<br>art the destroyer; to thee that art irresistible, to thee that art<br>Brahman, to thee that leadest the life of a brahmacari; to thee that art<br>Ishana; to thee that art immeasurable, to thee that art the great<br>controller, to thee that art robed in tatters; to thee that art ever<br>engaged in penances, to thee that art tawny, to thee that art observant<br>of vows, to thee that art robed in animal skins; to thee that art the<br>sire of Kumara, to thee that art three-eyed, to thee that art armed with<br>the foremost of weapons, to thee that destroyest the afflictions of all<br>that seek thy shelter, to thee that destroyest all haters of brahmanas,<br>to thee that art the lord of all trees, the lord of all men, the lord of<br>all kine, and ever the lord of sacrifices. Salutations to thee that art<br>always at the head of troops, to thee that art three-eyed, to thee that<br>art endued with fierce energy. We devote ourselves to thee in thought,<br>word and deed. Be gracious unto us.' Gratified with these adorations, the<br>holy one, saluting them with the word 'Welcome' said unto them, 'Let your<br>fears be dispelled. Say, what we are to do for you?'"'"
