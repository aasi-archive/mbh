                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'In that awful and fathomless encounter of the<br>Pandavas and the Srinjayas with the warriors of my army, when Dhananjaya,<br>O sire, proceeded for battle, how, indeed, did the fight occur?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'The innumerable divisions of the Pandava army, decked<br>with lofty standards and swelling (with pride and energy) and united<br>together in battle, began to roar aloud, drums and other instruments<br>constituting their mouth, like masses of clouds at the close of summer<br>uttering deep roars. The battle that ensued resembled a baneful shower<br>out of season, cruel and destructive of living creatures. Huge elephants<br>were its clouds; weapons were the water they were to pour; the peal of<br>musical instruments, the rattle of car-wheels, and the noise of palms,<br>constituted their roar; diverse weapons decked with gold formed their<br>flashes of lightning; and arrows and swords and cloth-yard shafts and<br>mighty weapons constituted their torrents of rain. Marked by impetuous<br>onsets blood flowed in streams in that encounter. Rendered awful by<br>incessant strokes of the sword, it was fraught with a great carnage of<br>Kshatriyas. Many car-warriors, united together, encompassed one<br>car-warrior and despatched him to Yama's presence. Or, one foremost of<br>car-warriors despatched a single adversary, or one despatched many<br>adversaries united together. Again, some one car-warrior despatched to<br>Yama's abode some one adversary along with his driver and steeds. Some<br>one rider, with a single elephant, despatched many car-warriors and<br>horsemen. Similarly, Partha, with clouds of shafts, despatched large<br>number of cars with drivers and steeds, of elephants and horses with<br>their riders, and of foot-soldiers, belonging to the enemy. Kripa and<br>Shikhandi encountered each other in that battle, while Satyaki proceeded<br>against Duryodhana. And Srutasravas was engaged with Drona's son, and<br>Yudhamanyu with Citrasena. The great Srinjaya car-warrior Uttamauja was<br>engaged with Karna's son Sushena, while Sahadeva rushed against Shakuni,<br>the king of the Gandharas, like a hungry lion against a mighty bull. The<br>youthful Satanika, the son of Nakula, rushed against the youthful<br>Vrishasena, the son of Karna, shooting showers of shafts. The heroic son<br>of Karna struck that son of the princess of Pancala with many arrows.<br>Conversant with all modes of warfare, Madri's son Nakula, that bull among<br>car-warriors, assailed Kritavarma. The king of the Pancalas,<br>Dhrishtadyumna, the son of Yajnasena, attacked Karna, the commander of<br>the Kaurava army, with all his forces. Duhshasana, O Bharata, with the<br>swelling host of the samsaptakas forming a portion of the Bharata army,<br>fiercely attacked in that battle Bhima, that foremost of warriors of<br>irresistible impetuosity. The heroic Uttamauja, putting forth his<br>strength struck the son of Karna and cut off his head which fell down on<br>the earth, filling the earth and the welkin with a loud noise. Beholding<br>the head of Sushena lying on the ground, Karna became filled with grief.<br>Soon, however, in rage he cut off the steeds, the car, and the standard,<br>of his son's slayer with many keen shafts. Meanwhile Uttamauja, piercing<br>with his keen shafts and cutting off with his bright sword the steeds of<br>Kripa and those warriors also that protected Kripa's sides, quickly<br>ascended the car of Shikhandi. Beholding Kripa deprived of his car,<br>Shikhandi who was on his vehicle, wished not to strike him with his<br>shafts. The son of Drona then, covering with his own the car of Kripa,<br>rescued the latter like a bull sunk in a mire. Meanwhile Bhima, the son<br>of the Wind-god clad in golden mail, began to scorch with his keen arrows<br>the troops of thy sons like the mid-day sun scorching everything in the<br>summer season.'"
