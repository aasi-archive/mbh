                            "Sanjaya said, 'Upon the fall of the great bowman Drona, thy sons, those<br>mighty car-warriors, became pale and deprived of their senses. Armed with<br>weapons, all of them, O monarch, hung down their heads. Afflicted with<br>grief and without looking at one another, they stood perfectly silent.<br>Beholding them with such afflicted countenances, thy troops, O Bharata,<br>themselves perturbed by grief, vacantly gazed upwards. Seeing Drona slain<br>in battle, the weapons of many of them, O king, dyed with blood, dropped<br>from their hands. Innumerable weapons, again, O Bharata, still retained<br>in the grasp of the soldiers, seemed in their pendent attitude, to<br>resemble falling meteors in the sky. Then king Duryodhana, O monarch,<br>beholding that army of thine thus standing as if paralysed and lifeless,<br>said, "Relying upon the might of your army I have summoned the Pandavas<br>to battle and caused this passage-at-arms to commence! Upon the fall of<br>Drona, however, the prospect seems to be cheerless. Warriors engaged in<br>battle all die in battle. Engaged in battle, a warrior may have either<br>victory or death. What can be strange then in this (viz., the death of<br>Drona)? Fight ye with faces turned towards every direction. Behold now<br>the high-souled Karna, the son of Vikartana, that great bowman of mighty<br>strength, careering in battle, using his celestial weapons! Through fear<br>of that warrior in battle, that coward, viz., Dhananjaya, the son of<br>Kunti, always turns back like a small deer at the sight of a lion! It is<br>he who, by the ordinary methods of human battle, brought the mighty<br>Bhimasena endued with the strength of 10,000 elephants to that plight! It<br>is he who, uttering a loud roar, slew with his invincible dart the brave<br>Ghatotkaca of a 1,000 illusions and well-acquainted with celestial<br>weapons! Behold today the inexhaustible might of arms of that intelligent<br>warrior of sure aim and invincible energy! Let the sons of Pandu behold<br>today the prowess of both Ashvatthama and Karna resembling that of Vishnu<br>and Vasava! All of you are singly able to slay the sons of Pandu with<br>their troops in battle! How much more then are you capable, when united<br>together, of that feat! Endued with great energy and accomplished in<br>weapons, you will today behold one another engaged in the achievement of<br>mighty tasks!'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Having said these words, O sinless one, thy son<br>Duryodhana, with his brothers, made Karna the generalissimo (of the Kuru<br>army). Obtaining the command, the mighty car-warrior Karna, so fierce in<br>battle, uttered loud roars and fought with the foe. He caused, O sire, a<br>great carnage among the Srinjayas, the Pancalas, the Kekayas, and the<br>Videhas. From his bow issued innumerable lines of arrows, one close<br>behind the wings of another, like flights of bees. Having afflicted the<br>Pancalas and the Pandavas endued with great activity, and slain thousands<br>of warriors, he was at last slain by Arjuna!"
