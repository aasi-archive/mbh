                            "Sanjaya said, 'Thus raged that great battle between those lords of Earth<br>when Arjuna and Karna and Bhimasena, the son of Pandu became angry.<br>Having vanquished the son of Drona, and other great car-warriors, Arjuna,<br>O king, addressing Vasudeva, said, "Behold, O Krishna of mighty arms, the<br>Pandava army is flying away. Behold, Karna is slaying our great<br>car-warriors in this battle. I do not, O thou of Dasaratha's race, see<br>king Yudhishthira the just. Nor is the standard of Dharma's son, foremost<br>of warriors, visible. The third part of the day still remaineth,<br>Janardana. No one amongst the Dhartarashtras cometh against me for fight.<br>For doing, therefore, what is agreeable to me, proceed to the spot where<br>Yudhishthira is. Beholding Dharma's son safe and sound with his younger<br>brothers in battle, I will again fight with the foe, O thou of Vrishni's<br>race." At these words of Vibhatsu, Hari (Krishna) quickly proceeded on<br>that car to that spot where king Yudhishthira, along with the mighty<br>Srinjaya car-warriors of great strength, were fighting with the foe,<br>making death their goal. During the progress of that great carnage,<br>Govinda, beholding the field of battle, addressed Savyasaci, saying,<br>"Behold, O Partha, how great and awful is this carnage, O Bharata, of<br>Kshatriyas on Earth for the sake of Duryodhana. Behold, O Bharata, the<br>gold-backed bows of slain warriors, as also their costly quivers<br>displaced from their shoulders. Behold those straight shafts equipped<br>with wings of gold, and those clothyard arrows washed with oil and<br>looking like snakes freed from their sloughs. Behold, O Bharata, those<br>scimitars, decked with gold, and having ivory handles, and those<br>displaced shields embossed with gold. Behold those lances decked with<br>gold, those darts having golden ornaments, and those huge maces twined<br>round with gold. Behold those swords adorned with gold, those axes with<br>golden ornaments, and the heads of those battle-axes fallen off from<br>their golden handles. Behold those iron Kuntas, those short clubs<br>exceedingly heavy, those beautiful rockets, those huge bludgeons with<br>spiked heads, those discs displaced from the arms of their wielders, and<br>those spears (that have been used) in this dreadful battle. Endued (while<br>living) with great activity, warriors that came to battle, having taken<br>up diverse weapons, are lying, though deprived of life, as if still<br>alive. Behold, thousands of warriors lying on the field, with limbs<br>crushed by means of maces, or heads broken by means of heavy clubs, or<br>torn and mangled by elephants and steeds and cars. The field of battle is<br>covered with shafts and darts and swords and axes and scimitars and<br>spiked maces and lances and iron Kuntas and battle-axes, and the bodies<br>of men and steeds and elephants, hacked with many wounds and covered with<br>streams of blood and deprived of life, O slayer of foes. The Earth looks<br>beautiful, O Bharata, with arms smeared with sandal, decked with Angadas<br>of gold and with Keyuras, and having their ends cased in leathern fences.<br>With hands cased in leathern fences, with displaced ornaments, with<br>severed thighs looking like elephants' trunks of many active warriors,<br>with fallen heads, decked with costly gems and earrings, of heroes having<br>large expansive eyes, the Earth looks exceedingly beautiful. With<br>headless trunks smeared all over with blood with severed limbs and heads<br>and hips, the Earth looks, O best of the Bharatas, like an altar strewn<br>with extinguished fires. Behold those beautiful cars with rows of golden<br>bells, broken in diverse ways, and those slain steeds lying scattered on<br>the field, with arrows yet sticking to their bodies. Behold those bottoms<br>of cars, those quivers, those banners, those diverse kinds of standards,<br>those gigantic conchs of car-warriors, white in hue and scattered all<br>over the field. Behold those elephants, huge as hills, lying on the<br>Earth, with tongues lolling out, and those other elephants and steeds,<br>deprived of life and decked with triumphal banners. Behold those housings<br>of elephants, and those skins and blankets, and those other beautiful and<br>variegated and torn blankets. Behold those rows of bells torn and broken<br>in diverse ways in consequence of falling elephants of gigantic size, and<br>those beautiful goads set with stones of lapis lazuli, and those hooks<br>falling upon the ground. Behold those whips, adorned with gold, and<br>variegated with gems, still in the grasp of (slain) horsemen, and those<br>blankets and skins of the Ranku deer falling on the ground but which had<br>served for seats on horse back. Behold those gems for adorning the<br>diadems of kings, and those beautiful necklaces of gold, and those<br>displaced umbrellas and yak-tails for fanning. Behold the Earth, miry<br>with blood, strewn with the faces of heroes, decked with beautiful<br>earrings and well-cut beards and possessed of the splendour of the moon<br>and stars. Behold those wounded warriors in whom life is not yet extinct<br>and who, lying all around, are uttering wails of woe. Their relatives, O<br>prince, casting aside their weapons are tending them, weeping<br>incessantly. Having covered many warriors with arrows and deprived them<br>of life, behold those combatants, endued with activity longing for<br>victory, and swelling with rage, are once more proceeding for battle<br>against their antagonists. Others are running hither and thither on the<br>field. Being begged for water by fallen heroes, others related to them<br>have gone in quest of drink. Many, O Arjuna, are breathing their last<br>meanwhile. Returning their brave relatives, seeing them become senseless<br>are throwing down the water they brought and are running wildly, shouting<br>at one another. Behold, many have died after having slaked their thirst,<br>and many, O Bharata, are dying while drinking. Others, though<br>affectionate towards relatives, are still seen to rush towards foes in<br>great battle deserting their dear relatives. Others, again, O best of<br>men, biting their nether lips, and with faces rendered terrible in<br>consequence of the contraction of their brows, are surveying the field<br>all around." While saying these words unto Arjuna, Vasudeva proceeded<br>towards Yudhishthira. Arjuna also, beholding the king in that great<br>battle, repeatedly urged Govinda, saying, "Proceed, Proceed." Having<br>shown the field of battle to Partha, Madhava, while proceeding quickly,<br>slowly said unto Partha once more, "Behold those kings rushing towards<br>king Yudhishthira. Behold Karna, who resembles a blazing fire, on the<br>arena of the battle. Yonder the mighty-bowman Bhima is proceeding to<br>battle. They that are the foremost among the Pancalas, the Srinjayas, and<br>the Pandavas&#8212;they, that is, that have Dhrishtadyumna for their head, are<br>following Bhima. The vast army of the enemy is again broken by the<br>rushing Parthas. Behold, O Arjuna, Karna is trying to rally the flying<br>Kauravas. Resembling the Destroyer himself in impetuosity and Indra<br>himself in prowess, yonder proceedeth Drona's son, O thou of Kuru's race,<br>that hero who is the foremost of all wielders of weapons. The mighty<br>carwarrior Dhrishtadyumna is rushing against that hero. The Srinjayas are<br>following the lead of Dhristadyumna. Behold, the Srinjayas are falling."<br>Thus did the invincible Vasudeva describe everything unto the<br>diadem-decked Arjuna. Then, O king, commenced a terrible and awful<br>battle. Loud leonine shouts arose as the two hosts encountered each<br>other, O monarch, making death their goal. Even thus, O king, in<br>consequence of thy evil counsels, did that destruction set in on Earth, O<br>lord of Earth, of both thy warriors and those of the enemy.'"
