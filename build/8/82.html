                            "Sanjaya said, 'After the Kurus, O king, had been put to flight by the<br>mighty car-warrior Arjuna of white steeds, the Suta's son Karna began to<br>destroy the sons of the Pancalas with his mighty shafts, like the tempest<br>destroying congregated masses of clouds. Felling Janamejaya's driver with<br>broad-faced shafts called Anjalikas, he next slew the steeds of that<br>Pancala warrior. With a number of broad-headed arrows he then pierced<br>both Satanika and Sutasoma and then cut off the bows of both those<br>heroes. Next he pierced Dhrishtadyumna with six arrows, and then, without<br>the loss of a moment, he slew in that encounter the steeds of that<br>prince. Having slain next the steeds of Satyaki, the Suta's son then slew<br>Visoka, the son of the ruler of the Kaikayas. Upon the slaughter of the<br>Kaikaya prince, the commander of the Kaikaya division, Ugrakarman, rushed<br>with speed and striking Prasena, the son of Karna, with many shafts of<br>fierce impetuosity caused him to tremble. Then Karna, with three<br>crescent-shaped arrows, cut off the arms and the head of his son's<br>assailant, whereupon the latter, deprived of life, fell down upon the<br>ground from his car, like a Sala tree with its branches lopped off with<br>an axe. Then Prasena, with many keen arrows of straight course, covered<br>the steedless grandson of Sini, and seemed to dance upon his car. Soon,<br>however, the son of Karna, struck by the grandson of Sini, fell down.<br>Upon the slaughter of his son, Karna, with heart filled with rage,<br>addressed that bull among the Sinis from desire of slaying him, saying,<br>"Thou art slain, O grandson of Sini!' and sped at him an arrow capable of<br>slaying all foes. Then Shikhandi cut off that arrow with three shafts of<br>his, and struck Karna himself with three other shafts. The fierce son of<br>the Suta then, cutting off with a couple of razor-faced arrows the bow<br>and the standard of Shikhandi, struck and pierced Shikhandi himself with<br>six shafts, and then cut off the head of Dhrishtadyumna's son. The<br>high-souled son of Adhiratha then pierced Sutasoma with a very keen<br>shaft. During the progress of that fierce battle, and after<br>Dhrishtadyumna's son had been slain, Krishna, O lion among kings,<br>addressed Partha, saying, "The Pancalas are being exterminated. Go, O<br>Partha, and slay Karna." Thus addressed the mighty-armed Arjuna, that<br>foremost of men, smiled and then proceeded on his car towards the car of<br>Adhiratha's son desirous, on that occasion of terror, of rescuing the<br>Pancalas slaughtered by Karna, that leader of car-warriors. Stretching<br>his Gandiva of loud twang and fiercely striking his palms with her<br>bow-string, he suddenly created a darkness by means of his arrows and<br>destroyed large numbers of men and steeds and cars and standards. The<br>echoes (of that twang) travelled through the welkin. The birds, (no<br>longer finding room in their own element), took shelter in the caverns of<br>mountains. With his full-drawn bow, Arjuna looked resplendent. Indeed, as<br>the diadem-decked Partha, at that terrible moment, fell upon the foe,<br>Bhimasena, that foremost of heroes, proceeded on his car behind that son<br>of Pandu, protecting his rear. Those two princes then, on their cars,<br>proceeded with great speed towards Karna, encountering their foes along<br>the way. During that interval, the Suta's son fought fiercely, grinding<br>the Somakas. He slew a large number of car-warriors and steeds and<br>elephants, and covered the ten points of the compass with his shafts.<br>Then Uttamauja and Janamejaya, and the enraged Yudhamanyu and Shikhandi,<br>uniting with Prishata's son (Dhrishtadyumna) and uttering loud roars,<br>pierced Karna with many shafts. Those five foremost of Pancala<br>car-warriors rushed against Karna otherwise called Vaikartana, but they<br>could not shake him off his car like the objects of the senses failing to<br>shake off the person of purified soul from abstinence. Quickly cutting<br>off their bows, standards, steeds, drivers and banners, with his shafts,<br>Karna struck each of them with five arrows and then uttered a loud roar<br>like a lion, People then became exceedingly cheerless, thinking that the<br>very earth, with her mountains and trees, might split at the twang of<br>Karna's bow while that hero, with shafts in hand touching the bow-string,<br>was employed in shooting at his assailants and slaying his foes. Shooting<br>his shafts with that large and extended bow of his that resembled the bow<br>of Sakra himself, the son of Adhiratha looked resplendent like the sun,<br>with his multitude of blazing rays, within his corona. The Suta's son<br>then pierced Shikhandi with a dozen keen shafts, and Uttamauja with half<br>a dozen, and Yudhamanyu with three, and then each of the other two, viz.,<br>Somaka (Janamejaya) and Prishata's son (Dhrishtadyumna) with three<br>shafts. Vanquished in dreadful battle by the Suta's son, O sire, those<br>five mighty car-warriors then stood inactive, gladdening their foes, even<br>as the objects of the senses are vanquished by a person of purified soul.<br>The five sons of Draupadi then, with other well-equipped cars, rescued<br>those maternal uncles of theirs that were sinking in the Karna ocean,<br>like persons rescuing from the depths of the ocean ship-wrecked merchants<br>in the sea by means of other vessels. Then that bull among the Sinis,<br>cutting off with his own keen shafts the innumerable arrows sped by<br>Karna, and piercing Karna himself with many keen arrows made entirely of<br>iron, pierced thy eldest son with eight shafts. Then Kripa, and the Bhoja<br>chief (Kritavarma), and thy son, and Karna himself, assailed Satyaki in<br>return with keen shafts. That foremost one, however, of Yadu's race<br>fought with those four warriors like the chief of the Daityas fighting<br>with the Regents of the (four) quarters. With his twanging bow stretched<br>to its fullest limits, and from which shafts flowed incessantly, Satyaki<br>became exceedingly irresistible like the meridian Sun in the autumnal<br>sky. Those scorchers of foes then, viz., the mighty car-warriors among<br>the Pancalas, once more riding on their cars and clad in mail and united<br>together, protected that foremost one among the Sinis, like the Maruts<br>protecting Sakra while engaged in afflicting his foes in battle. The<br>battle fraught with the slaughter of men and steeds and elephants that<br>then ensued between thy foes and the warriors of thy army, became so<br>fierce that it resembled the encounter in days of old between the gods<br>and the Asuras. Car-warriors and elephants and steeds and foot-soldiers,<br>covered with showers of diverse weapons, began to move from one point to<br>another. Struck by one another, they reeled or uttered wails of woe in<br>affliction or fell down deprived of life. When such was the state of<br>affairs, thy son Duhshasana, the younger brother of the king, fearlessly<br>advanced against Bhima, shooting showers of shafts. Vrikodara also rushed<br>impetuously against him, like a lion springing towards a large Ruru deer.<br>The encounter then that took place between those two heroes incensed with<br>each other and who engaged in battle's sport making life itself the<br>stake, became exceedingly fierce, resembled that between Samvara and<br>Sakra in days of old. They struck each other deeply with shafts possessed<br>of great energy and capable of piercing each other's body, like two<br>mighty elephants excited with lust and with juicy secretions incessantly<br>trickling down their bodies, fighting with each other in the vicinity of<br>a she-elephant in her season. Vrikodara, with great speed, cut off, with<br>a couple of razor-headed arrows, the bow and the standard of thy son.<br>With another winged arrow he pierced his antagonist's forehead and then<br>(with a fourth) cut off from his trunk the head of the latter's driver.<br>Prince Duhshasana, taking up another bow, pierced Vrikodara with a dozen<br>shafts. Himself holding the reins of his steeds, he once more poured over<br>Bhima a shower of straight arrows. Then Duhshasana sped a shaft bright as<br>the rays of the sun, decked with gold, diamonds, and other precious gems,<br>capable of piercing the body of his assailant, and irresistible as the<br>stroke of Indra's thunder. His body pierced therewith, Vrikodara fell,<br>with languid limbs and like one deprived of life and with outstretched<br>arms, upon his own excellent car. Recovering his senses, however, he<br>began to roar like a lion.'"
