                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then those two vast armies, teeming with rejoicing men<br>and steeds and elephants, resembling in splendour the celestial and the<br>Asura hosts, meeting together, began to strike each other. Men, cars,<br>steeds, elephants, and foot-soldiers of fierce prowess, made sturdy<br>strokes destructive of bodies and sin. Lion-like men strewed the Earth<br>with the heads of lion-like men, each resembling the full moon or the sun<br>in splendour and the lotus in fragrance. Combatants cut off the heads of<br>combatants, with crescent-shaped and broad-headed shafts and razor-faced<br>arrows and axes, and battle-axes. The arms of men of long and massive<br>arms, cut off by men of long and massive arms, falling upon the Earth,<br>shone, decked with weapons and bracelets. With those writhing arms<br>adorned with red fingers and palms, the Earth looked resplendent as if<br>strewn with fierce five-headed snakes slain by Garuda. From elephants and<br>cars and steeds, brave warriors fell down, struck by foes, like the<br>denizens of heaven from their celestial cars on the exhaustion of their<br>merits. Other brave warriors fell down by hundreds, crushed in that<br>battle by brave combatants with heavy maces spiked clubs and short<br>bludgeons. Cars also, in that tumultuous fight, were crushed by cars, and<br>infuriate elephants by infuriate compeers, and horsemen by horsemen. Men<br>destroyed by cars, and cars by elephants, and horsemen by foot-soldiers,<br>and foot-soldiers by horsemen, dropped down on the field, as also cars<br>and steeds and foot-soldiers destroyed by elephants and cars and steeds<br>and elephants by foot-soldiers, and cars and foot-soldiers and elephants<br>by steeds and men and elephants by cars. Great was the carnage made of<br>car-warriors and steeds and elephants and men by men and steeds and<br>elephants and car-warriors, using their hands and feet and weapons and<br>cars. When that host was being thus struck and slain by heroic warriors<br>the Parthas, headed by Vrikodara, advanced against us. They consisted of<br>Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi and the five sons of Draupadi and the<br>Prabhadrakas, and Satyaki and Chekitana with the Dravida forces, and the<br>Pandyas, the Cholas, and the Keralas, surrounded by a mighty array, all<br>possessed of broad chests, long arms, tall statures, and large eyes.<br>Decked with ornaments, possessed of red teeth, endued with the prowess of<br>infuriate elephants, attired in robes of diverse colours, smeared with<br>powdered scents, armed with swords and nooses, capable of restraining<br>mighty elephants, companions in death, and never deserting one another,<br>equipped with quivers, bearing bows adorned with long locks, and<br>agreeable in speech were the combatants of the infantry files led by<br>Satyaki, belonging to the Andhra tribe, endued with fierce forms and<br>great energy. Other brave warriors such as the Cedis, the Pancalas, the<br>Kaikayas, the Karushas, the Kosalas, the Kanchis, and the Maghadhas, also<br>rushed forward. Their cars and steeds and elephants, all of the foremost<br>kind, and their fierce foot-soldiers, gladdened by the notes of diverse<br>instruments, seemed to dance and laugh. In the midst of that vast force,<br>came Vrikodara, riding on the neck of an elephant, and surrounded by many<br>foremost of elephant-soldiers, advancing against thy army. That fierce<br>and foremost of elephants, duly equipped, looked resplendent, like the<br>stone-built mansion on the top of the Udaya mountain, crowned with the<br>risen Sun. Its armour of iron, the foremost of its kind, studded with<br>costly gems, was as resplendent as the autumnal firmament bespangled with<br>stars. With a lance in his outstretched arm, his head decked with a<br>beautiful diadem, and possessed of the splendour of the meridian Sun at<br>autumn, Bhima began to burn his foes. Beholding that elephant from a<br>distance, Kshemadhurti, himself on an elephant, challenging, rushed<br>cheerfully towards Bhima who was more cheerful still. An encounter then<br>took place between those two elephants of fierce forms resembling two<br>huge hills topped with trees, each, fighting with the other as it liked.<br>Those two heroes, then, whose elephants thus encountered each other,<br>forcibly struck each other with lances endued with the splendour of solar<br>rays, and uttered loud roars. Separating, they then careered in circles<br>with their elephants, and each taking up a bow began to strike the other.<br>Gladdening the people around with their loud roars and the slaps on their<br>armpits and the whizz of this arrows, they continued to utter leonine<br>shouts. Endued with great strength, both of them, accomplished in<br>weapons, fought, using their elephants with upturned trunks and decked<br>with banners floating on the wind. Then each cutting off the other's bow,<br>they roared at each other, and rained on each other showers of darts and<br>lances like two masses of clouds in the rainy season pouring torrents of<br>rain. Then Kshemadhurti pierced Bhimasena in the centre of the chest with<br>a lance endued with great impetuosity, and then with six others, and<br>uttered a loud shout. With those lances sticking to his body, Bhimasena,<br>whose form then blazed with wrath, looked resplendent like the<br>cloud-covered Sun with his rays issuing through the interstices of that<br>canopy. Then Bhima carefully hurled at his antagonist a lance bright as<br>the rays of the Sun, coursing perfectly straight, and made entirely of<br>iron. The ruler of the Kulutas then, drawing his bow, cut off that lance<br>with ten shafts and then pierced the son of Pandu with sixty shafts. Then<br>Bhima the son of Pandu, taking up a bow whose twang resembled the roar of<br>the clouds, uttered a loud shout and deeply afflicted with his shafts the<br>elephants of his antagonist. Thus afflicted in that battle by Bhimasena<br>with his arrows, that elephant, though sought to be restrained, stayed<br>not on the field like a wind-blown cloud. The fierce prince of elephants<br>owned by Bhima then pursued his (flying) compeer, like a wind-blown mass<br>of clouds pursuing another mass driven by the tempest. Restraining his<br>own elephant valiant Kshemadhurti pierced with his shafts the pursuing<br>elephant of Bhimasena. Then with a well-shot razor-headed arrow that was<br>perfectly straight, Kshemadhurti cut off his antagonist's bow and then<br>afflicted that hostile elephant. Filled with wrath, Kshemadhurti then, in<br>that battle, pierced Bhima and struck his elephant with many long shafts<br>in every vital part. That huge elephant of Bhima then fell down, O<br>Bharata! Bhima, however, who had jumped down from his elephant and stood<br>on the Earth before the fall of the beast, then crushed the elephant of<br>his antagonist with his mace. And Vrikodara then struck Kshemadhurti<br>also, who, jumped down from his crushed elephant, was advancing against<br>him with uplifted weapon. Kshemadhurti, thus struck, fell down lifeless,<br>with the sword in his arm, by the side of his elephant, like a lion<br>struck down by thunder beside a thunder-riven hill. Beholding the<br>celebrated king of the Kulutas slain, thy troops, O bull of Bharata's<br>race exceedingly distressed, fled away.'"
