                            "Sanjaya said, 'Upon the fall of Karna otherwise called Vaikartana, the<br>Kauravas, afflicted with fear, fled away on all sides, casting their eyes<br>on empty space. Indeed, hearing that the heroic Karna had been slain by<br>the foe, all thy troops, stupefied with fear, broke and fled in all<br>directions. Then, O king, the leaders, filled with anxiety, desirous of<br>withdrawing their troops, O Bharata, whose flight had been endeavoured to<br>be checked by thy son. Understanding their wishes, thy son, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, acting according to the advice of Shalya, withdrew the<br>army. Then Kritavarma, O Bharata, surrounded by thy unslaughtered remnant<br>of thy Narayana troops of thy army, quickly proceeded towards the<br>encampment. Surrounded by a 1,000 gandharvas, Shakuni, beholding the son<br>of Adhiratha slain, proceeded quickly towards the encampment.<br>Sharadvata's son, Kripa, O king, surrounded by the large elephant force<br>that resembled a mass of clouds, proceeded quickly towards the<br>encampment. The heroic Ashvatthama, repeatedly drawing deep breaths at<br>the sight of the victory of the Pandavas, proceeded quickly towards the<br>encampment. Surrounded by the unslaughtered remnant of the samsaptakas<br>which was still a large force, Susharma also, O king, proceeded, casting<br>his eyes on those terrified soldiers. King Duryodhana, deeply afflicted<br>and deprived of everything, proceeded, his heart filled with grief, and a<br>prey to many cheerless thoughts. Shalya, that foremost of car-warriors,<br>proceeded towards the camp, on that car deprived of standard, casting his<br>eyes on all sides. The other mighty car-warriors of the Bharata army,<br>still numerous, fled quickly, afflicted with fear, filled with shame, and<br>almost deprived of their senses. Indeed seeing Karna overthrown, all the<br>Kauravas fled away quickly, afflicted and anxious with fear, trembling,<br>and with voices choked with tears. The mighty car-warriors of thy army<br>fled away in fear, O chief of Kuru's race, some applauding Arjuna, some<br>applauding Karna. Amongst those thousands of warriors of thy army in that<br>great battle, there was not a single person who had still any wish for<br>fight. Upon the fall of Karna, O monarch, the Kauravas became hopeless of<br>life, kingdom, wives, and wealth. Guiding them with care, O lord, thy<br>son, filled with grief and sorrow, set his heart upon resting them for<br>the night. Those great car-warriors also, O monarch, accepting his orders<br>with bent heads, retired from the field with cheerless hearts and pale<br>faces.'"
