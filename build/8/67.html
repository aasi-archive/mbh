                            "Sanjaya said, 'Hearing these words of the righteous king who had been<br>filled with anger, that high-souled atiratha, Jishnu of infinite energy,<br>replied unto the invincible Yudhishthira of great might, saying, "While<br>battling with the samsaptakas today, Drona's son who always proceedeth at<br>the head of the Kuru troops, O king, suddenly came before me, shooting<br>shafts that resembled snakes of virulent poison. Beholding my car, of<br>rattle deep as the roar of clouds, all the troops began to encompass it.<br>Slaying full five hundred of those, I then, O foremost of kings,<br>proceeded against Drona's son. Approaching me, O king, that hero with<br>great resolution rushed against me like a prince of elephants against a<br>lion, and desired to rescue, O monarch, the Kaurava car-warriors that<br>were being slaughtered by me. Then, in that battle, O Bharata, the<br>preceptor's son, that foremost of heroes among the Kurus, incapable of<br>being made to tremble, began to afflict me and Janardana with whetted<br>shafts resembling poison or fire. While engaged in battle with me, eight<br>carts, each drawn by eight bullocks, carried his hundreds of arrows. He<br>shot them all at me, but like a wind destroying the clouds I destroyed<br>with my shafts that arrowy shower of his. He then shot at me, with skill<br>and force and resolution, thousands of other arrows, all sped from his<br>bow-string stretched to his very ear, even like a black cloud in the<br>season of rains pouring in torrents the water with which it is charged.<br>So quickly did Drona's son career in that battle that we could not<br>discern from which side, the left or the right, he shot his arrows, nor<br>could we notice when he took up his arrows and when he let them off.<br>Indeed, the bow of Drona's son was seen by us to be incessantly drawn to<br>a circle. At last, the son of Drona pierced me with five whetted arrows<br>and Vasudeva also with five whetted arrows. Within the twinkling of an<br>eye, however, I afflicted him with the force of thunderbolts. Exceedingly<br>afflicted with those shafts sped by me, he soon assumed the form of a<br>porcupine. All his limbs became bathed in blood. Beholding his troops,<br>those foremost of warriors all covered with blood and overwhelmed by me,<br>he then entered the car-division of the Suta's son. Seeing the troops<br>overwhelmed by me in battle, and struck with fear, and beholding the<br>elephants and steeds flying away, that grinder (of hostile hosts), viz.,<br>Karna approached me quickly with fifty great carwarriors. Slaying them<br>all and avoiding Karna, I have quickly come hither for seeing thee. All<br>the Pancalas are afflicted with fear at sight of Karna like kine at the<br>scent of a lion. The Prabhadrakas also, O king, having approached Karna,<br>are like persons that have entered the wide open jaws of Death. Karna has<br>already despatched to Yama's abode full seventeen hundred of those<br>distressed car-warriors. Indeed, O king, the Suta's son did not become<br>cheerless till he had a sight of us. Thou hadst first been engaged with<br>Ashvatthama and exceedingly mangled by him. I heard that after that thou<br>wert seen by Karna. O thou of inconceivable feats, I thought that thou<br>must have, O king, been enjoying rest (in the camp), having come away<br>from the cruel Karna. I have seen, O son of Pandu, the great and<br>wonderful (Bhargava) weapon of Karna displayed in the van of battle.<br>There is now no other warrior among the Srinjayas that is able to resist<br>the mighty car-warrior Karna. Let Sini's grandson Satyaki and<br>Dhrishtadyumna, O king, be the protectors of my car-wheels. Let the<br>heroic princes Yudhamanyu and Uttamauja protect my rear. O thou of great<br>glory, encountering that heroic and invincible car-warrior, viz., the<br>Suta's son, staying in the hostile army, like Sakra encountering Vritra,<br>O foremost of kings, I will, O Bharata, fight with the Suta's son if he<br>can be found in this battle today. Come and behold me and the Suta's son<br>contending with each other in battle for victory. There, the Prabhadrakas<br>are rushing towards the face of a mighty bull. There, O Bharata, 6,000<br>princes are sacrificing themselves in battle today, for the sake of<br>heaven. If, putting forth my strength, I do not, O king, slay Karna today<br>with all his relatives while engaged in battle with him, then that end<br>will be mine, O lion among kings, which is his that does not accomplish a<br>vow taken by him. I beg of thee, bless me, saying that victory will be<br>mine in battle. Yonder, the Dhartarashtras are about to devour Bhima. I<br>will, O lion among kings, slay the Suta's son and his troops and all our<br>foes!"'"
