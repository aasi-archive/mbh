                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then Kritavarma, and Kripa, and the son of Drona and the<br>Suta's son, O sire, and Uluka, and Subala's son (Shakuni), and the king<br>himself, with his uterine brothers, beholding the (Kuru) army afflicted<br>with the fear of Pandu's son, unable to stand together, like a vessel<br>wrecked on the ocean, endeavoured to rescue it with great speed. For a<br>short space of time, O Bharata, the battle that once more took place<br>became exceedingly fierce, enhancing as it did the fears of timid and the<br>joy of the brave. The dense showers of arrows shot in battle by Kripa,<br>thick, as flights of locusts, covered the Srinjayas. Then Shikhandi,<br>filled with rage, speedily proceeded against the grandson of Gautama<br>(Kripa) and poured upon that bull amongst Brahmanas his arrowy downpours<br>from all sides. Acquainted with the highest weapons Kripa then checked<br>that arrowy downpour, and wrathfully pierced Shikhandi with ten arrows in<br>that battle. Then Shikhandi filled with rage, deeply pierced Kripa, in<br>that encounter, with seven straight arrows equipped with Kanka feathers.<br>The twice-born Kripa then, that great car-warrior, deeply pierced with<br>those keen arrows, deprived Shikhandi of his steeds, driver and car.<br>Jumping down from his steedless vehicle, the mighty car-warrior<br>(Shikhandi) rushed impetuously at the Brahmana, having taken up a sword<br>and a shield. As the Pancala prince advanced, Kripa quickly covered him<br>with many straight arrows in that encounter, which seemed exceedingly<br>wonderful. Indeed, exceedingly wonderful was the sight that we then<br>beheld, even like the flying of rocks, for Shikhandi, O king, (thus<br>assailed) remained perfectly inactive in that battle. Beholding Shikhandi<br>covered (with arrows) by Kripa, O best of the kings, the mighty<br>car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna speedily proceeded against Kripa. The great<br>car-warrior Kritavarma, however, rushing impetuously received<br>Dhrishtadyumna as the latter proceeded against the son of Sharadvata<br>(Kripa). Then Drona's son checked Yudhishthira as the latter, with his<br>son and troops, was rushing towards the car of Sharadvata's son. Thy son<br>Duryodhana, shooting a shower of arrows, received and checked Nakula and<br>Sahadeva, those two great car-warriors endued with celerity. Karna too,<br>otherwise called Vaikartana, O Bharata, in that battle, resisted<br>Bhimasena, and the Karushas, the Kaikayas, and the Srinjayas. Meanwhile<br>Sharadvata's son, in that battle, O sire, with great activity, sped many<br>arrows at Shikhandi, as if for the purpose of burning him outright. The<br>Pancala prince, however, whirling his sword repeatedly, cut off all those<br>arrows, decked with gold, that had been sped at him by Kripa from all<br>sides. The grandson of Gautama (Kripa) then quickly cut off with his<br>arrows the shield of Prishata's son, that was decked with hundred moons.<br>At this feat of his, the troops made a loud uproar. Deprived of his<br>shield, O monarch, and placed under Kripa's power Shikhandi still rushed,<br>sword in hand, (towards Kripa), like a sick man towards the jaws of<br>Death. Then Suketu, the son of Citraketu, O king, quickly proceeded<br>towards the mighty Shikhandi plunged into such distress and assailed in<br>that manner by Kripa with his arrows. Indeed, the young prince of<br>immeasurable soul rushed towards the car of Sharadvata's son and poured<br>upon that Brahmana, in that battle, innumerable shafts of great keenness.<br>Beholding that Brahmana observant of vows thus engaged in battle (with<br>another), Shikhandi, O best of kings, retreated hastily from that spot.<br>Meanwhile Suketu, O king, piercing the son of Gautama with nine arrows,<br>once more pierced him with seventy and again with three. Then the prince,<br>O sire, cut off Kripa's bow with arrow fixed thereon, and with another<br>shaft struck hard the latter's driver in a vital limb. The grandson of<br>Gautama then, filled with rage, took up a new and very strong bow and<br>struck Suketu with thirty arrows in all his vital limbs. All his limbs<br>exceedingly weakened, the prince trembled on his excellent car like a<br>tree trembling exceedingly during an earthquake. With a razor-headed<br>arrow then, Kripa struck off from the prince's trunk, while the latter<br>was still trembling, his head decked with a pair of blazing earrings and<br>head-protector. That head thereupon fell down on the Earth like a piece<br>of meat from the claws of a hawk, and then his trunk also fell down, O<br>thou of great glory. Upon the fall of Suketu, O monarch, his troops<br>became frightened, and avoiding Kripa, fled away on all sides.<br><br>"'Encompassing the mighty Dhrishtadyumna, Kritavarma cheerfully addressed<br>him saying, "Wait, Wait!" The encounter then that took place between the<br>Vrishni and the Pancala warriors in that battle became exceedingly<br>fierce, like that between two hawks, O king, for a piece of meat. Filled<br>with rage, Dhrishtadyumna, in that battle, struck the son of Hridika<br>(Kritavarma, the ruler of Bhoja) with nine arrows in the chest, and<br>succeeded in afflicting him greatly. Then Kritavarma, thus deeply struck<br>by Prishata's son in that encounter, covered his assailant, his steeds,<br>and his car with his shafts. Thus shrouded, O king, along with his car,<br>Dhrishtadyumna became invisible, like the Sun shrouded by rain-charged<br>clouds. Baffling all those shafts decked with gold, Dhrishtadyumna, O<br>king, looked resplendent in that battle in his wounds. The commander of<br>the Pandava forces, viz., the son of Prishata, then, filled with rage,<br>approached Kritavarma and poured upon him a fierce shower of arrows. The<br>son of Hridika, however, in that battle, with many thousands of his own<br>arrows, destroyed that fierce arrowy shower coursing towards him with<br>great impetuosity. Beholding his irresistible shower of arrows checked in<br>that battle by Kritavarma, the son of Prishata, approaching his<br>antagonist, began to resist him. And soon he despatched Kritavarma's<br>driver to Yama's abode with a broad-headed arrow of great sharpness.<br>Deprived of life, the driver fell down from the car. The mighty<br>Dhrishtadyumna, having vanquished his mighty antagonist, began then to<br>resist the Kauravas with shafts, without losing a moment. Then thy<br>warriors, O king, rushed towards Dhrishtadyumna, uttering loud leonine<br>roars. At this a battle once more took place between them.'"
