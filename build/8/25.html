                            "Sanjaya said, 'Against Yuyutsu who was employed in routing the vast army<br>of thy son, Uluka proceeded with speed saying "Wait, Wait." Then Yuyutsu,<br>O king, with a winged arrow of keen edge struck Uluka with great force,<br>like (Indra himself striking ) a mountain with the thunderbolt. Filled<br>with rage at this, Uluka, in that battle, cut off thy son's bow with a<br>razor-headed arrow and struck thy son himself with a barbed shaft.<br>Casting off that broken bow, Yuyutsu, with eyes red in wrath, took up<br>another formidable bow endued with greater impetus. The prince then, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, pierced Uluka with sixty arrows. Piercing next<br>the driver of Uluka, Yuyutsu struck Uluka once more. Then Uluka, filled<br>with rage pierced Yuyutsu with twenty shafts adorned with gold, and then<br>cut off his standard made of gold. That lofty and gorgeous standard made<br>of gold, O king, thus cut off (by Uluka), fell down in front of Yuyutsu's<br>car. Beholding his standard cut off, Yuyutsu, deprived of his senses by<br>wrath, struck Uluka with five shafts in the centre of the chest. Then<br>Uluka, O sire, in that battle, cut off, with a broad-headed arrow steeped<br>in oil, the head of his antagonist's driver, O best of the Bharatas.<br>Slaying next his four steeds he struck Yuyutsu himself with five arrows.<br>Deeply struck by the strong Uluka, Yuyutsu proceeded to another car.<br>Having vanquished him in battle, O king, Uluka proceeded quickly towards<br>the Pancalas and the Srinjayas and began to slaughter them with sharp<br>shafts. Thy son Srutakarman, O monarch, within half the time taken up by<br>a wink of the eye, fearlessly made Satanika steedless and driverless and<br>carless. The mighty car-warrior Satanika, however, staying on his<br>steedless car, O sire, hurled a mace, filled with rage, at thy son. That<br>mace, reducing thy son's car with its steeds and driver into fragments,<br>fell down upon the Earth with great speed, and pierced it through. Then<br>those two heroes, both enhancers of the glory of the Kurus, deprived of<br>their cars, retreated from the encounter, glaring at each other. Then thy<br>son, overcome with fear, mounted upon the car of Vivingsu, while Satanika<br>quickly got upon the car of Prativindhya. Shakuni, filled with rage,<br>pierced Sutasoma with many keen shafts, but failed to make the latter<br>tremble like a torrent of water failing to produce any impression upon a<br>mountain. Beholding that great enemy of his father, Sutasoma covered<br>Shakuni, O Bharata, with many thousands of arrows. Shakuni, however, that<br>warrior of sure aim and conversant with all methods of warfare, actuated<br>by desire of battle, quickly cut off all those shafts with his own winged<br>arrows. Having checked those shafts with his own keen arrows in battle,<br>Shakuni, filled with rage, struck Sutasoma with three arrows. Thy<br>brother-in-law then, O monarch, with his arrows cut off into minute<br>fragments the steeds, the standard, and the driver of his adversary, at<br>which all the spectators uttered a loud shout. Deprived of his steed and<br>car, and having his standard cut off, O sire, the great bowman<br>(Sutasoma), jumping down from his car, stood on the Earth, having taken<br>up a good bow. And he shot a large number of arrows equipped with golden<br>wings and whetted on stone, and shrouded therewith the car of thy<br>brother-in law in that battle. The son of Subala, however, beholding<br>those showers of arrows that resembled a flight of locusts, coming<br>towards his car, did not tremble. On the other hand, that illustrious<br>warrior crushed all those arrows with arrows of his own. The warriors<br>that were present there, as also the Siddhas in the firmament, were<br>highly pleased at sight of that wonderful and incredible feat of<br>Sutasoma, inasmuch as he contended on foot with Shakuni staying in his<br>car. Then Shakuni, with a number of broad-headed shafts of great<br>impetuosity, keen and perfectly straight, cut off, O king, the bow of<br>Sutasoma as also all his quivers. Bowless, and carless, Sutasoma then,<br>uplifting a scimitar of the hue of the blue lotus and equipped with an<br>ivory handle, uttered a loud shout. That scimitar of the intelligent<br>Sutasoma of the hue of the clear sky, as it was whirled by that hero, was<br>regarded by Shakuni to be as fatal as the rod of Death. Armed with that<br>scimitar he suddenly began to career in circles over the arena,<br>displaying, O monarch, the fourteen different kinds of manoeuvres, endued<br>as he was with skill and might. Indeed, he displayed in that battle all<br>those motions such as wheeling about and whirling on high, and making<br>side-thrusts and jumping forward and leaping on high and running above<br>and rushing forward and rushing upwards. The valiant son of Subala then<br>sped a number of arrows at his foe, but the latter quickly cut them off<br>with that excellent scimitar of his as they coursed towards him. Filled<br>with rage (at this), the son of Subala, O king, once more sped at<br>Sutasoma a number of shafts that resembled snakes of virulent poison.<br>Aided by his skill and might, Sutasoma cut off even these with his<br>scimitar, displaying his great activity, and possessed as he was of<br>prowess equal to that of Garuda himself. With a razor-headed arrow of<br>great sharpness, Shakuni then, O king, cut off that bright scimitar of<br>his adversary as the latter careered in circles before him. Thus cut off,<br>(half of) that large scimitar suddenly fell down on the Earth, while half<br>of it, O Bharata, continued in the grasp of Sutasoma. Seeing his sword<br>cut off, the mighty car-warrior Sutasoma retreated six steps and then<br>hurled that half (of the scimitar) which he had in his grasp at his foe.<br>The fragment decked with gold and gems, cutting off the bow, with string,<br>of the illustrious Shakuni, quickly fell down on the Earth. Then Sutasoma<br>went to the great car of Srutakirti. Subala's son also, taking up another<br>formidable and invincible bow, proceeded towards the Pandava army,<br>slaying large numbers of foes (on the way). Beholding the son of Subala<br>careering fearlessly in battle, a loud uproar, O king, arose among the<br>Pandavas in that part of the army. People witnessed those large and proud<br>divisions bristling with arms, routed by the illustrious son of Subala.<br>Even as the chief of the celestials crushed the Daitya army, the son of<br>Subala destroyed that army of the Pandavas.'"
