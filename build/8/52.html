                            "Sanjaya said, 'Those Kshatriyas, O monarch, harbouring feelings of<br>animosity against one another and longing to take one another's life,<br>began to slay one another in that battle. Throngs of cars, and large<br>bodies of horses, and teeming divisions of infantry and elephants in<br>large numbers mingled with one another, O king, for battle. We beheld the<br>falling of maces and spiked bludgeons and Kunapas and lances and short<br>arrows and rockets hurled at one another in that dreadful engagement.<br>Arrowy showers terrible to look at coursed like flights of locusts.<br>Elephants approaching elephants routed one another. Horsemen encountering<br>horsemen in that battle, and car-warriors encountering car-warriors, and<br>foot-soldiers encountering foot-soldiers, and foot-soldiers meeting with<br>horsemen, and foot-soldiers meeting with cars and elephants, and cars<br>meeting with elephants and horsemen, and elephants of great speed meeting<br>with the three other kinds of forces, began, O king, to crush and grind<br>one another. In consequence of those brave combatants striking one<br>another and shouting at the top of their voices, the field of battle<br>became awful, resembling the slaughter-ground of creatures (of Rudra<br>himself). The Earth, O Bharata, covered with blood, looked beautiful like<br>a vast plain in the season of rains covered with the red coccinella.<br>Indeed, the Earth assumed the aspect of a youthful maiden of great<br>beauty, attired in white robes dyed with deep red. Variegated with flesh<br>and blood, the field of battle looked as if decked all over with gold.<br>Large numbers of heads severed from trunks and arms and thighs and<br>earrings and other ornaments displaced from the bodies of warriors, O<br>Bharata, and collars and cuirasses and bodies of brave bowmen, and coats<br>of mail, and banners, lay scattered on the ground. Elephants coming<br>against elephants tore one another with their tusks, O king. Struck with<br>the tusks of hostile compeers, elephants looked exceedingly beautiful.<br>Bathed in blood, those huge creatures looked resplendent like moving<br>hills decked with metals, down whose breasts ran streams of liquid chalk.<br>Lances hurled by horsemen, or those held horizontally by hostile<br>combatants, were seized by many of those beasts, while many amongst them<br>twisted and broke those weapons. Many huge elephants, whose armour had<br>been cut off with shafts, looked, O king, like mountains divested of<br>clouds at the advent of winter. Many foremost of elephants pierced with<br>arrows winged with gold, looked beautiful like mountains, O sire, whose<br>summits are lighted with blazing brands. Some of those creatures, huge as<br>hills, struck by hostile compeers, fell down in that battle, like winged<br>mountains (when clipped of their wings). Others, afflicted with arrows<br>and much pained by their wounds, fell down touching the Earth, in that<br>dreadful battle, at their frontal globes or the parts between their<br>tusks. Others roared aloud like lions. And many, uttering terrible<br>sounds, ran hither and thither, and many, O king, uttered cries of pain.<br>Steeds also, in golden trappings, struck with arrows, fell down, or<br>became weak, or ran in all directions. Others, struck with arrows and<br>lances or dragged down, fell on the Earth and writhed in agony, making<br>diverse kinds of motion. Men also, struck down, fell on the Earth,<br>uttering diverse cries of pain, O sire; others, beholding their relatives<br>and sires and grandsires, and others seeing retreating foes, shouted to<br>one another their well-known names and the names of their races. The arms<br>of many combatants, decked with ornaments of gold, cut off, O king, by<br>foes, writhed on the ground, making diverse kinds of motions. Thousands<br>of such arms fell down and sprang up, and many seemed to dart forward<br>like five-headed snakes. Those arms, looking like the tapering bodies of<br>snakes, and smeared with sandal paste, O king, looked beautiful, when<br>drenched with blood, like little standards of gold. When the battle,<br>becoming general, raged so furiously on all sides, the warriors fought<br>with and slew one another without distinct perceptions of those they<br>fought with or struck. A dusty cloud overspread the field of battle, and<br>the weapons used fell in thick showers. The scene being thus darkened,<br>the combatants could no longer distinguish friends from foes. Indeed,<br>that fierce and awful battle proceeded thus. And soon there began to flow<br>many mighty rivers of the bloody currents. And they abounded with the<br>heads of combatants that formed their rocks. And the hair of the warriors<br>constituted their floating weeds and moss. Bones formed the fishes with<br>which they teemed, and bows and arrows and maces formed the rafts by<br>which to cross them. Flesh and blood forming their mire, those terrible<br>and awful rivers, with currents swelled by blood, were thus formed there,<br>enhancing the fears of the timid and the joy of the brave. Those awful<br>rivers led to the abode of Yama. Many plunged into those streams<br>inspiring Kshatriyas with fear, and perished. And in consequence of<br>various carnivorous creatures, O tiger among men, roaring and yelling on<br>all sides, the field of battle became terrible like the domains of the<br>king of the dead. And innumerable headless trunks rose up on all sides.<br>And terrible creatures, gorging on flesh and drinking fat, and blood, O<br>Bharata, began to dance around. And crows and vultures and cranes,<br>gratified with fat and marrow and other animals relishing flesh, were<br>seen to move about in glee. They, however, O king, that were heroes,<br>casting off all fear which is so difficult of being cast off, and<br>observing the vow of warriors, fearlessly did their duty. Indeed, on that<br>field where countless arrows and darts coursed through the air, and which<br>was crowded with carnivorous creatures of diverse kinds, brave warriors<br>careered fearlessly, displaying their prowess. Addressing one another, O<br>Bharata, they declared their names and families. And many amongst them,<br>declaring the names of their sires and families, O lord, began to crush<br>one another, O king, with darts and lances and battle-axes. During the<br>progress of that fierce and awful battle, the Kaurava army became<br>strengthless and unable to bear up any longer like a foundered vessel on<br>the bosom of the ocean.'"
