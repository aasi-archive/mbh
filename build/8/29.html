                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'I have heard from thee, O Sanjaya, of many poignant<br>and unbearable griefs as also of the losses sustained by my sons. From<br>what thou hast said unto me, from the manner in which the battle has been<br>fought, it is my certain conviction, O Suta, that the Kauravas are no<br>more. Duryodhana was made carless in that dreadful battle. How did<br>Dharma's son (then) fight, and how did the royal Duryodhana also fight in<br>return? How also occurred that battle which was fought in the afternoon?<br>Tell me all this in detail, for thou art skilled in narration, O Sanjaya.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'When the troops of both armies were engaged in battle,<br>according to their respective divisions, thy son Duryodhana, O king,<br>riding on another car and filled with rage like a snake of virulent<br>poison, beholding king Yudhishthira the just, quickly addressed his own<br>driver, O Bharata, saying, "Proceed, proceed, quickly take me there, O<br>driver, where the royal son of Pandu, clad in mail shineth under yon<br>umbrella held over his head." Thus urged by the king, the driver, in that<br>battle, quickly urged his royal master's goodly car towards the face of<br>Yudhishthira. At this, Yudhishthira also, filled with rage and looking<br>like an infuriate elephant, urged his own driver saying, "Proceed to<br>where Suyodhana is." Then those two heroes and brothers and foremost of<br>car-warriors encountered each other. Both endued with great energy, both<br>filled with wrath, both difficult of defeat in battle, approaching each<br>other, those two great bowmen began to mangle each other with their<br>arrows in that battle. Then king Duryodhana, in that encounter, O sire,<br>with a broad-headed arrow whetted on stone, cut in twain the bow of the<br>virtuous monarch. Filled with rage, Yudhishthira could not brook that<br>insult. Casting aside his broken bow, with eyes red in wrath, Dharma's<br>son took up another bow at the head of his forces, and then cut off<br>Duryodhana's standard and bow. Duryodhana then, taking up another bow,<br>pierced the son of Pandu. Filled with rage, they continued to shoot<br>showers of shafts at each other. Desirous of vanquishing each other, they<br>resembled a pair of angry lions. They struck each other in that battle<br>like a couple of roaring bulls. Those mighty car-warriors continued to<br>career, expecting to find each other's lapses. Then wounded with shafts<br>sped from bows drawn to their fullest stretch the two warriors, O king,<br>looked resplendent like flowering Kinsukas. They then, O king, repeatedly<br>uttered leonine roars. Those two rulers of men, in that dreadful battle,<br>also made loud sounds with their palms and caused their bows to twang<br>loudly. And they blew their conchs too with great force. And they<br>afflicted each other very much. Then king Yudhishthira, filled with rage,<br>struck thy son in the chest with three irresistible shafts endued with<br>force of thunder. Him, however, thy royal son quickly pierced, in return,<br>with five keen shafts winged with gold and whetted on stone. Then king<br>Duryodhana, O Bharata, hurled a dart capable of slaying everybody,<br>exceedingly keen, and resembling a large blazing brand. As it advanced,<br>king Yudhishthira the just, with sharp shafts, speedily cut it off into<br>three fragments, and then pierced Duryodhana also with five arrows.<br>Equipped with golden staff, and producing a loud whizz, that dart then<br>fell down, and while falling, looked resplendent like a large brand with<br>blazing flames. Beholding the dart baffled, thy son, O monarch, struck<br>Yudhishthira with nine sharp and keen-pointed arrows. Pierced deeply by<br>his mighty foe, that scorcher of foes quickly took up an arrow for aiming<br>it at Duryodhana. The mighty Yudhishthira then placed that arrow on his<br>bow-string. Filled with rage and possessed of great valour, the son of<br>Pandu then shot it at his foe. That arrow, striking thy son, that mighty<br>car-warrior, stupefied him and then (passing through his body) entered<br>the Earth. Then Duryodhana, filled with wrath, uplifting a mace of great<br>impetuosity, rushed at king Yudhishthira the just, for ending the<br>hostilities (that raged between the Kurus and the Pandus). Beholding him<br>armed with that uplifted mace and resembling Yama himself with his<br>bludgeon, king Yudhishthira the just hurled at thy son a mighty dart<br>blazing with splendour, endued with great impetuosity, and looking like a<br>large blazing brand. Deeply pierced in the chest by that dart as he stood<br>on his car, the Kuru prince, deeply pained, fell down and swooned away.<br>Then Bhima, recollecting his own vow, addressed Yudhishthira, saying,<br>"This one should not be slain by thee, O king." At this Yudhishthira<br>abstained from giving his foe the finishing blow. At that time<br>Kritavarma, quickly advancing, came upon thy royal son then sunk in an<br>ocean of calamity. Bhima then, taking up a mace adorned with gold and<br>flaxen chords, rushed impetuously towards Kritavarma in that battle. Thus<br>occurred the battle between thy troops and the foe on that afternoon, O<br>monarch, every one of the combatants being inspired with the desire of<br>victory.'"
