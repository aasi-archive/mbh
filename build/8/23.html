                            "Sanjaya said, 'While Sahadeva, filled with rage, was thus blasting thy<br>host, Duhshasana, O great king, proceeded against him, the brother<br>against the brother. Beholding those two engaged in dreadful combat, all<br>the great car-warriors uttered leonine shouts and waved their garments.<br>Then, O Bharata, the mighty son of Pandu was struck in the chest with<br>three arrows by thy angry son armed with bow. Then Sahadeva, O king,<br>having first pierced thy son with an arrow, pierced him again with<br>seventy arrows, and then his driver with three. Then Duhshasana, O<br>monarch, having cut off Sahadeva's bow in that great battle, pierced<br>Sahadeva himself with three and seventy arrows in the arms and the chest.<br>Then Sahadeva filled with rage, took up a sword, in that dreadful<br>conflict, and whirling, hurled it quickly towards the car of thy son.<br>Cutting off Duhshasana's bow with string and arrow fixed on it, that<br>large sword fell down on the Earth like a snake from the firmament. Then<br>the valiant Sahadeva taking up another bow, shot a deadly shaft at<br>Duhshasana. The Kuru warrior, however, with his keen-edged sword, cut off<br>into two fragments that shaft, bright as the rod of Death, as it coursed<br>towards him. Then whirling that sharp sword, Duhshasana quickly hurled it<br>in that battle as his foe. Meanwhile that valiant warrior took up another<br>bow with a shaft. Sahadeva, however, with the greatest ease, cut off,<br>with his keen shafts, that sword as it coursed towards him, and caused it<br>to fall down in that battle. Then, O Bharata, thy son, in that dreadful<br>battle, quickly sped four and sixty shafts at the car of Sahadeva.<br>Sahadeva, however, O king, cut off every one of those numerous arrows as<br>they coursed with great impetuosity towards him, with five shafts of his.<br>Checking then those mighty shafts sped by thy son, Sahadeva, in that<br>battle, sped a large number of arrows at his foe. Cutting off each of<br>those shafts with three shafts of his, thy son uttered a loud shout,<br>making the whole Earth resound with it. Then Duhshasana, O king, having<br>pierced Sahadeva in that battle, struck the latter's driver with nine<br>arrows. The valiant Sahadeva then, O monarch, filled with rage, fixed on<br>his bow-string a terrible shaft resembling the Destroyer himself and<br>forcibly drawing the bow, he sped that shaft at thy son. Piercing with<br>great speed through his strong armour and body, that shaft entered the<br>Earth, O king, like a snake penetrating into an ant-hill. Then thy son,<br>that great car-warrior, swooned away, O king. Beholding him deprived of<br>his senses, his driver quickly took away the car, himself forcibly struck<br>all the while with keen arrows. Having vanquished the Kuru warrior thus,<br>the son of Pandu, beholding Duryodhana's division, began to crush it on<br>all sides. Indeed, O king, as a man excited with wrath crushes swarm of<br>ants, even so, O Bharata did that son of Pandu begin to crush the Kaurava<br>host.'"
