                            "Sanjaya said, 'Wheeling round, like the planet Mercury in the curvature<br>of its orbit, Jishnu (Arjuna) once more slew large number of the<br>samsaptakas. Afflicted with the shafts of Partha, O king, men, steeds,<br>and elephants, O Bharata, wavered and wondered and lost colour and fell<br>down and died. Many foremost of animals tied to yokes and drivers and<br>standards, and bows, and shafts and hands and weapons in grasp, and arms,<br>and heads, of heroic foes fighting with him, the son of Pandu cut off in<br>that battle, with arrows, some of which were broad-headed, some equipped<br>with heads like razors, some crescent-shaped, and some furnished with<br>heads like the calf's tooth. Like bulls fighting with a bull for the sake<br>of a cow in season, brave warriors by hundreds and thousands closed upon<br>Arjuna. The battle that took place between them and him made the hair to<br>stand on end like the encounter between the Daityas and Indra, the<br>wielder of the thunderbolt on the occasion of the conquest of the three<br>worlds. Then the son of Ugrayudha pierced Partha with three shafts<br>resembling three venomous snakes. Partha, however, cut off from his<br>enemy's trunk the latter's head. Then those warriors, filled with rage,<br>covered Arjuna from every side with diverse kinds of weapons like the<br>clouds urged by the Maruts shrouding Himavat at the close of summer.<br>Checking with his own weapons those of his foes on every side, Arjuna<br>slew a large number of his enemies with well-shot shafts. With his arrows<br>Arjuna then cut off the Trivenus, the steeds, the drivers, and the<br>parshni drivers of many cars, and displaced the weapons and quivers of<br>many, and deprived many of their wheels and standards, and broke the<br>cords, the traces and the axles of many, and destroyed the bottoms and<br>yokes of others, and caused all the equipment of many to fall from their<br>places. Those cars, thus smashed and injured by Arjuna in large numbers,<br>looked like the luxurious mansions of the rich destroyed by fire, wind,<br>and rain. Elephants, their vitals pierced with shafts resembling<br>thunderbolts in impetuosity, fell down like mansions on mountain-tops<br>overthrown by blasts of lightning. Large numbers of steeds with their<br>riders, struck by Arjuna, fell down on the Earth, their tongues and<br>entrails pressed out, themselves deprived of strength and bathed in<br>blood, and presenting an awful sight. Men and steeds and elephants,<br>pierced by Savyasaci (Arjuna) with his shafts, wondered and tottered and<br>fell down and uttered cries of pain and looked pale, O sire. Like<br>Mahendra smiting down the danavas, Partha smote down large numbers of his<br>foes, by means of shafts whetted on stone and resembling the thunder of<br>poison in deadliness. Brave warriors, cased in costly coats of mail and<br>decked with ornaments and armed with diverse kinds of weapons, lay on the<br>field, with their cars and standards, slain by Partha. Vanquished (and<br>deprived of life) persons of righteous deeds, possessed of noble birth<br>and great knowledge, proceeded to heaven in consequence of those glorious<br>deeds of theirs while their bodies only lay on Earth. Then the chief,<br>belonging to thy army, of various realms, filled with wrath and<br>accompanied by their followers, rushed against Arjuna, that foremost of<br>car-warriors. Warriors borne on their cars and steeds and elephants, and<br>foot-soldiers also, all desirous of slaying (Arjuna), rushed towards him,<br>shooting diverse weapons with great speed. Then Arjuna like wind, by<br>means of keen shafts, destroyed that thick shower of weapons dropped by<br>those warriors constituting a mass of congregated clouds. People then<br>beheld Arjuna crossing that raftless ocean constituted by steeds and<br>foot-soldiers and elephants and cars, and having mighty weapons for its<br>waves, on a bridge constituted by his own mighty weapons of offence and<br>defence. Then Vasudeva, addressing Partha, said, "Why, O sinless one,<br>dost thou sport in this way? Grinding these samsaptakas, haste thyself<br>for Karna's slaughter." Saying, "So be it" unto Krishna, Arjuna then,<br>forcibly smiting the remnant of the samsaptakas with his weapons, began<br>to destroy them like Indra destroying the Daityas. At that time, with<br>even the closest attention, men could not mark when Arjuna took out his<br>shafts, when he aimed them and when he let them off quickly. Govinda<br>himself, O Bharata, regarded it wonderful. Like swans diving into a lake<br>the shafts of Arjuna, white and active as swans, penetrated into the<br>hostile force. Then Govinda, beholding the field of battle during the<br>progress of that carnage, said these words to Savyasaci, "Here, O Partha,<br>for the sake of Duryodhana alone, occurreth this great and terrible<br>destruction of the Bharatas and other kings of Earth. Behold, O son of<br>Bharata, these bows, with golden backs, of many mighty bowmen, and these<br>girdles and quivers loosened from their bodies. Behold these straight<br>shafts equipped with wings of gold, and these long arrows washed with oil<br>and looking like snakes freed from their sloughs. Behold these beautiful<br>lances decked with gold lying scattered about, and these coats of mail, O<br>Bharata, adorned with gold and fallen off from the bodies of the<br>warriors. Behold these spears embellished with gold, these darts adorned<br>with the same metal, and these huge maces twined round with threads of<br>gold, and cords of hemp. Behold these swords decked with bright gold and<br>these axes adorned with the same, and these battle-axes equipped with<br>gold-decked handles. Behold also these spiked clubs, these short arrows,<br>these Bhusundis, and these Kanapas; these iron Kuntas lying around, and<br>these heavy Mushalas. These victory-longing warriors endued with great<br>activity and armed with diverse weapons, though dead, still seem to be<br>quick with life. Behold those thousands of warriors, their limbs crushed<br>with maces, and heads split with Mushalas or smashed and trod by<br>elephants and steeds and cars. O slayer of foes, the field of battle is<br>strewn with the bodies of men and elephants and steeds, deprived of life,<br>dreadfully mangled with shafts and darts and swords and lances and<br>scimitars and axes and spears and Nakharas and bludgeons, and bathed in<br>streams of blood. Strewn with arms smeared with sandal-paste and decked<br>with Angadas and graced with auspicious indications and cased in leathern<br>fences and adorned with Keyuras, the Earth looks resplendent, O Bharata.<br>Strewn also with hands having fingers cased in fences, decked with<br>ornaments, and lopped off from arms, and with severed thighs looking like<br>the trunks of elephants, of heroes endued with great activity and with<br>heads adorned with earrings and headgears set with gems, (the Earth looks<br>exceedingly beautiful). Behold those beautiful cars, decked with golden<br>bells, broken in diverse ways. Behold those numerous steeds bathed in<br>blood, those bottoms of cars and long quivers, and diverse kinds of<br>standards and banners and those huge conchs, of the combatants, and those<br>yak-tails perfectly white, and those elephants with tongues lolling out<br>and lying on the field like hills, and those beautiful with triumphal<br>banners, and those slain elephant-warriors, and those rich coverlets,<br>each consisting of one piece of blanket, for the backs of those huge<br>beasts, and those beautiful and variegated and torn blankets, and those<br>numerous bells loosened from the bodies of elephants and broken into<br>fragments by those falling creatures, and those hooks with handles set<br>with stones of lapis lazuli fallen upon the Earth, and those ornamental<br>yokes of steeds, and those armours set with diamonds for their breasts<br>and those rich cloths, adorned with gold and tied to the ends of the<br>standards borne by horsemen, and those variegated coverlets and housings<br>and Ranku skins, set with brilliant gems and inlaid with gold, for the<br>backs of steeds and fallen on the ground, and those large diamonds<br>adorning the head-gears of kings, and those beautiful necklaces of gold,<br>and those umbrellas displaced from their positions, and those yak-tails<br>and fans. Behold the earth strewn with faces adorned with earrings bright<br>as the moon or stars, and embellished with well-cut beards, and each<br>looking like the full moon. The earth, strewn with those faces looking<br>like lilies and lotuses, resembles a lake adorned with a dense assemblage<br>of lilies and lotuses. Behold, the earth possessing the effulgence of the<br>bright moon and diversified as if with myriads of stars, looks like the<br>autumnal firmament bespangled with stellar lights. O Arjuna, these feats<br>that have been achieved by thee in great battle today are, indeed, worthy<br>of thee or of the chief of the celestials himself in heaven." Even thus<br>did Krishna show the field of battle unto Arjuna. And while returning<br>(from the field to their camp), they heard a loud noise in the army of<br>Duryodhana. Indeed the uproar that was heard consisted of the blare of<br>conchs and the beat of cymbals and drums and Patahas and the clatter of<br>car wheels, the neighing of steeds, the grunt of elephants, and the<br>fierce clash of weapons. Penetrating into that force by the aid of his<br>steeds possessing the fleetness of the wind, Krishna became filled with<br>wonder upon beholding the army grinded by Pandya. Like Yama himself<br>slaying creatures whose lives have run out, Pandya, that foremost of<br>warriors skilled in shafts and weapons, was destroying crowds of foes by<br>means of diverse kinds of shafts. Piercing the bodies of the elephants<br>and steeds and men with sharp shafts, that foremost of smiters overthrew<br>and deprived them of life. Cutting off with his own shafts the diverse<br>weapons hurled at him by many foremost of foes, Pandya slew his enemies<br>like Sakra (Indra) destroying the Danavas.'"
