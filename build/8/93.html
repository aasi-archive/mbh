                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'What was the aspect of the Kuru and the Srinjaya<br>host on that awful day while it was crushed with arrows and scorched<br>(with weapons) in that encounter between Karna and Arjuna and while it<br>was flying away from the field?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Hear, O king, with attention how that awful and great<br>carnage of human beings and elephants and steeds occurred in battle.<br>When, after Karna's fall Partha uttered leonine shouts, a great fright<br>entered the hearts of thy sons. Upon the fall of Karna no warrior of thy<br>army set his heart on rallying the troops or putting forth his prowess.<br>Their refuge having been destroyed by Arjuna, they were then like<br>raftless merchants, whose vessels have wrecked on the fathomless ocean,<br>desirous of crossing the uncrossable main. After the slaughter of the<br>Suta's son, O king, the Kauravas, terrified and mangled with shafts,<br>masterless and desirous of protection, became like a herd of elephants<br>afflicted by lions. Vanquished by Savyasaci on that afternoon, they fled<br>away like bulls with broken horns or snakes with broken fangs. Their<br>foremost of heroes slain, their troops thrown into confusion, themselves<br>mangled with keen arrows, thy sons, after the fall of Karna, O king, fled<br>away in fear. Divested of weapons and armour, no longer able to ascertain<br>which point of the compass was which, and deprived of their senses, they<br>crushed one another in course of their flight and looked at one another,<br>afflicted with fear. "It is me that Vibhatsu is pursuing with speed!" "It<br>is me that Vrikodara is pursuing with speed!"&#8212;thought every one among<br>the Kauravas who became pale with fear and fell down as they fled. Some<br>on horses, some on cars, some on elephants, and some on foot, mighty<br>car-warriors, endued with great speed, fled away in fear. Cars were<br>broken by elephants, horsemen were crushed by great car-warriors, and<br>bands of foot-soldiers were trodden down by bodies of horsemen, as these<br>fled in fear. After the fall of the Suta's son, thy warriors became like<br>people without protectors in a forest teeming with beasts of prey and<br>robbers. They were then like elephants without riders and men without<br>arms. Afflicted with fear, they looked upon the world as if it were full<br>of Partha. Beholding them fly away afflicted with the fear of Bhimasena,<br>indeed, and seeing his troops thus leave the field in thousands,<br>Duryodhana, uttering cries of "Oh!" and "Alas!" addressed his driver,<br>saying, "Partha will never be able to transgress me standing bow in hand.<br>Urge my steeds slowly behind all the troops. Without doubt, if I fight<br>standing in the rear of the army, the son of Kunti will never be able to<br>transgress me even as the vast deep is unable to transgress its<br>continents. Slaying Arjuna and Govinda and the proud Vrikodara and the<br>rest of my foes, I will free myself from the debt I owe to Karna."<br>Hearing these words of the Kuru king that were so worthy of a hero and<br>honourable man, the charioteer slowly urged his steeds adorned with<br>trappings of gold. Then 25,000 warriors on foot, belonging to thy army,<br>without cars and cavalry and elephants among them, prepared for battle.<br>Bhimasena, filled with wrath, and Dhrishtadyumna the son of Prishata,<br>encompassed them with four kinds of forces and began to strike them with<br>their shafts. In return, those warriors fought with Bhima and Prishata's<br>son. Some amongst them challenged the two heroes by name. Then Bhimasena<br>became filled with rage. Alighting from his car, mace in hand, he fought<br>with those warriors arrived for battle. Observant of the rules of fair<br>fight, Vrikodara, the son of Kunti, came down from his car, and relying<br>upon the might of his arms, began to fight on foot with those foes of his<br>that were on foot. Taking up his massive mace adorned with gold, he began<br>to slaughter them all, like the Destroyer armed with his bludgeon. The<br>Kaurava warriors on foot, filled with rage and becoming reckless of their<br>lives, rushed against Bhima in that battle like insects upon a blazing<br>fire. Those infuriated combatants, difficult of being defeated in battle,<br>approaching Bhimasena, perished in a trice like living creatures upon<br>seeing the Destroyer. The mighty Bhima, armed with a mace, careered like<br>a hawk and destroyed all those 25,000 combatants. Having slain that<br>division of heroic warriors, Bhima, of prowess incapable of being baffled<br>and of great might, once more stood, with Dhrishtadyumna before him.<br>Possessed of great energy, Dhananjaya proceeded against the (remnant of<br>the) car-force (of the Kauravas). The two sons of Madri, and Satyaki,<br>filled with joy, rushed with speed against Shakuni and slaughtered the<br>troops of Subala's son. Having slain with keen shafts his cavalry and<br>elephants in that encounter, they rushed impetuously against Shakuni<br>himself, upon which a great battle took place. Meanwhile Dhananjaya, O<br>lord, proceeding against thy car-force, twanged his bow Gandiva<br>celebrated over the three worlds. Beholding that car having white steeds<br>yoked unto it and owning Krishna for its driver, and seeing that Arjuna<br>was the warrior standing on it, thy troops fled away in fear. 25,000<br>soldiers on foot, deprived of cars and mangled with shafts, had perished<br>(at the hands of Bhima and Dhrishtadyumna). Having slain them, that tiger<br>among men, that great car-warrior among the Pancalas, viz., the<br>high-souled Dhrishtadyumna the son of the Pancala king, soon showed<br>himself, with Bhimasena before him. That slayer of foes and mighty bowman<br>appeared exceedingly handsome. Beholding Dhrishtadyumna's car which had<br>steeds white as pigeons yoked unto it and whose lofty standard was made<br>of the trunk of a Kovidara, the Kauravas fled away in great fear. The<br>twins (Nakula and Sahadeva) of great fame, and Satyaki, having pursued<br>with great speed the king of the Gandharvas who was possessed of<br>lightness of hands in the use of weapons, re-appeared (amid the Pandava<br>ranks). Chekitana and Shikhandi and the (five) sons of Draupadi, O sire,<br>having slaughtered thy vast army, blew their conchs. All those heroes,<br>although they saw thy troops flying away with faces turned from the<br>field, still pursued them, like bulls pursuing angry bulls after<br>vanquishing them. Pandu's son Savyasaci of great might, O king, beholding<br>a remnant of thy army still standing for battle, became filled with<br>wrath. Possessed of great energy, Dhananjaya, rushed against that<br>car-force, drawing his bow Gandiva celebrated over the three worlds.<br>Suddenly he shrouded them with showers of arrows. The dust that was<br>raised darkened the scene and nothing could any longer be distinguished.<br>When the earth was thus shrouded with dust and when darkness covered<br>everything, thy troops, O king, fled on all sides from fear. When the<br>Kuru army was thus broken, the Kuru king, O monarch, viz., thy son,<br>rushed against all his foes advancing against him. Then Duryodhana<br>challenged all the Pandavas to battle, O chief of Bharata's race, like<br>the Asura Vali in days of yore challenging the gods. At this, all the<br>Pandava heroes, uniting together, rushed against the advancing<br>Duryodhana, shooting and hurling at him diverse weapons and upbraiding<br>him repeatedly. Duryodhana, however, filled with rage, fearlessly<br>slaughtered those enemies of his in hundreds and thousands, with keen<br>shafts. The prowess that we then beheld of thy son was exceedingly<br>wonderful, for alone and unsupported, he fought with all the Pandavas<br>united together. Duryodhana then beheld his own troops who, mangled with<br>arrows, had set their hearts on flight, gone not far from the field.<br>Rallying them then, O monarch, thy son who was resolved to maintain his<br>honour, gladdening those warriors of his, said these words unto them: "I<br>do not see that spot in the earth or on the mountains, whither if ye fly,<br>the Pandavas will not slay you! What use then in flying away? Small is<br>the force that the Pandavas now have. The two Krishnas also are<br>exceedingly mangled. If all of us stay for battle, victory will certainly<br>be ours. If we fly in disunion, the sinful Pandavas, pursuing us, will<br>certainly slay all of us. For this, it is better that we should die in<br>battle. Death in battle is fraught with happiness. Fight, observant of<br>the Kshatriya's duty. He that is dead knows no misery. On the other hand,<br>such a one enjoys eternal bliss hereafter. Listen, ye Kshatriyas, ay, all<br>of you, that are assembled here! When the destroyer Yama spareth neither<br>the hero nor the coward, who is there so foolish of understanding,<br>although observant of a Kshatriya's vow like us, that would not fight.<br>Would ye place yourselves under the power of the angry foe Bhimasena? It<br>behoveth you not to abandon the duty observed by your sires and<br>grandsires. There is no greater sin for a Kshatriya than flight from<br>battle. There is no more blessed path for heaven, ye Kauravas, than the<br>duty of battle. Slain in battle, ye warriors, enjoy heaven without<br>delay.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'While even these words were being uttered by thy<br>son, the (Kaurava) warriors, exceedingly mangled, fled away on all sides,<br>regardless of that speech.'"
