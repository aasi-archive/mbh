                            "Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile towards the northern part of the Pandava army,<br>a loud uproar arose of cars and elephants and steeds and foot-soldiers as<br>those were being massacred by Dandadhara. Turning the course of the car,<br>but without stopping the steeds which were as fleet as Garuda or the<br>wind, Keshava, addressing Arjuna, said, "The chief of the Magadhas, with<br>his (foe-crushing) elephant is unrivalled in prowess. In training and<br>might he is not inferior to Bhagadatta himself. Having slain him first,<br>thou wilt then slay the samsaptakas." At the conclusion of his words,<br>Keshava bore Partha to the presence of Dandadhara. The chief of the<br>Magadhas, peerless in handling the elephant-hook even as the headless<br>planet Ketu (is peerless) among all the planets, was destroying the<br>hostile army like a fierce comet destroying the whole earth. Riding on<br>his foe-slaying and well-equipped elephant which looked like the danava<br>with elephantine face and form, and whose roar resembled that of a<br>congregated mass of clouds, Dandadhara was destroying with his shafts<br>thousands of cars and steeds and elephants and men. The elephants also,<br>treading upon cars with their feet, pressed down into the Earth a large<br>number of men with their steeds and drivers. Many were the elephants,<br>also, which that foremost of elephants, crushed and slew with his two<br>forefeet and trunk. Indeed, the beast moved like the wheel of Death.<br>Slaying men adorned with steel coats of mail, along with their horses and<br>foot-soldiers, the chief of the Magadhas caused these to be pressed down<br>into the earth, like thick reeds pressed down with crackling sounds, by<br>means of that mighty and foremost of elephants belonging to him. Then<br>Arjuna, riding on that foremost of cars, rushed quickly towards that<br>prince of elephants in the midst of that host teeming with thousands of<br>cars and steeds and elephants, and resounding with the beat and blare of<br>innumerable cymbals and drums and conchs and uproarious with the clatter<br>of car-wheels, the twang of bow-strings, and the sound of palms. Even<br>Dandadhara pierced Arjuna with a dozen foremost of shafts and Janardana<br>with sixteen and each of the steeds with three, and then uttered a loud<br>shout and laughed repeatedly. Then Partha, with a number of broad-headed<br>shafts, cut off the bow of his antagonist with its string and arrow fixed<br>thereon, as also his well-decked standard, and then the guides of his<br>beast and the footmen that protected the animal. At this, the lord of<br>Girivraja became filled with rage. Desirous of agitating Janardana with<br>that tusker of his, whose temples had split from excitement, and which<br>resembled a mass of clouds and was endued with the speed of the wind,<br>Dandadhara struck Dhananjaya with many lances. The son of Pandu then,<br>with three razor-headed arrows, cut off, almost at the same instant of<br>time, the two arms each looking like the trunk of an elephant, and then<br>the head, resembling the full Moon, of his foe. Then Arjuna struck the<br>elephant of this antagonist with hundreds of arrows. Covered with the<br>gold-decked arrows of Partha, that elephant equipped with golden armour<br>looked as resplendent as a mountain in the night with its herbs and trees<br>blazing in a conflagration. Afflicted with the pain and roaring like a<br>mass of clouds, and exceedingly weakened, the elephant crying and<br>wandering and running with tottering steps, fell down with the guide on<br>its neck, like a mountain summit riven by thunder. Upon the fall of his<br>brother in battle, Danda advanced against Indra's younger brother and<br>Dhananjaya, desirous of slaying them, on his tusker white as snow and<br>adorned with gold and looking like a Himalayan summit. Danda struck<br>Janardana with three whetted lances bright as the rays of the sun, and<br>Arjuna with five, and uttered a loud shout. The son of Pandu then<br>uttering a loud shout cut off the two arms of Danda. Cut off by means of<br>razor-headed shafts, those two arms, smeared with sandal-paste, adorned<br>with angadas, and with lances in grasp, as they fell from the elephant's<br>back at the same instant of time, looked resplendent like a couple of<br>large snakes of great beauty falling down from a mountain summit. Cut off<br>with a crescent-shaped arrow by the diadem-decked (Partha), the head also<br>of Danda fell down on the Earth from the elephant's back, and covered<br>with blood it looked resplendent as it lay like the sun dropped from the<br>Asta mountain towards the western quarter. Then Partha pierced with many<br>excellent arrows bright as the rays of the sun that elephant of his foe,<br>resembling a mass of white clouds whereupon it fell down with a noise<br>like a Himalayan summit riven with thunder. Then other huge elephants<br>capable of winning victory and resembling the two already slain, were cut<br>off by Savyasaci, in that battle, even as the two (belonging to Danda and<br>Dandadhara) had been cut off. At this the vast hostile force broke. Then<br>elephants and cars and steeds and men, in dense throngs, clashed against<br>one another and fell down on the field. Tottering, they violently struck<br>one another and fell down deprived of life. Then his soldiers,<br>encompassing Arjuna like the celestials encompassing Purandara, began to<br>say, "O hero, that foe of whom we had been frightened like creatures at<br>the sight of Death himself, hath by good luck been slain by thee. If thou<br>hadst not protected from that fear those people that were so deeply<br>afflicted by mighty foes, then by this time our foes would have felt that<br>delight which we now feel at their death, O slayer of enemies." Hearing<br>these and other words uttered by friends and allies, Arjuna, with a<br>cheerful heart, worshipped those men, each according to his deserts, and<br>proceeded once more against the samsaptakas.'"
