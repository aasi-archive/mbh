                            "Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile Vikartana himself, resisting Bhimasena<br>supported by the Pancalas and the Cedis and the Kaikayas, covered him<br>with many arrows. In the very sight of Bhimasena, Karna, slew in that<br>battle many mighty car-warriors among the Cedis, the Karushas, and the<br>Srinjayas. Then Bhimasena, avoiding Karna, that best of car-warriors,<br>proceeded against the Kaurava troops like a blazing fire towards a heap<br>of dry grass. The Suta's son also in that battle, began to slay the<br>mighty bowmen amongst the Pancalas, the Kaikayas, and the Srinjayas, in<br>thousands. Indeed, the three mighty car-warriors viz., Partha and<br>Vrikodara and Karna, began to exterminate the samsaptakas, the Kauravas,<br>and the Pancalas, respectively. In consequence of thy evil policy, O<br>king, all these Kshatriyas, scorched with excellent shafts by those three<br>great warriors, began to be exterminated in that battle. Then Duryodhana,<br>O chief of the Bharatas, filled with rage, pierced Nakula and his four<br>steeds with nine arrows. Of immeasurable soul, thy son next, O ruler of<br>men, cut off the golden standard of Sahadeva with a razor-faced shaft.<br>Filled with wrath, Nakula then, O king, struck thy son with three and<br>seventy arrows in that battle, and Sahadeva struck him with five. Each of<br>those foremost warriors of Bharata's race and foremost of all bowmen, was<br>struck by Duryodhana in rage with five arrows. With a couple of<br>broad-headed arrows, then, he cut off the bows of both those warriors;<br>and then he suddenly pierced each of the twins with three and seventy<br>arrows. Taking up then two other beautiful and foremost of bows each of<br>which resembled the bow of Indra himself, those two heroes looked<br>beautiful like a pair of celestial youths in that battle. Then those two<br>brothers, both endued with great activity in battle, poured upon their<br>cousin, O king, ceaseless showers of terrible shafts like two masses of<br>clouds, pouring rain upon a mountain breast. Thereupon thy son, that<br>great car-warrior, O king filled with rage, resisted those two great<br>bowmen, viz., the twin sons of Pandu, with showers of winged arrows. The<br>bow of Duryodhana in that battle, O Bharata, seemed to be continuously<br>drawn into a circle, and shafts seemed to issue from it ceaselessly on<br>all sides. Covered with Duryodhana's shafts the two sons of Pandu ceased<br>to shine brightly, like the Sun and the Moon in the firmament, divested<br>of splendour, when shrouded by masses of clouds. Indeed, those arrows, O<br>king, equipped with wings of gold and whetted on stone, covered all the<br>points of the compass like the rays of the Sun, when the welkin was thus<br>shrouded and all that was seen was one uniform expanse of the Destroyer<br>himself, at the end of the Yuga. Beholding on the other hand, the prowess<br>of thy son, the great car-warriors all regarded the twin sons of Madri to<br>be in the presence of Death. The commander then, O king, of the Pandava<br>army, viz., the mighty car-warrior Parshata (Son of Prishata) proceeded<br>to that spot where Duryodhana was. Transgressing those two great<br>car-warriors, viz., the two brave sons of Madri, Dhrishtadyumna began to<br>resist thy son with his shafts. Of immeasurable soul, that bull among<br>men, viz., thy son, filled with the desire to retaliate, and smiling the<br>while, pierced the prince of Pancala with five and twenty arrows. Of<br>immeasurable soul and filled with the desire to retaliate, thy son once<br>more pierced the prince of Pancala with sixty shafts and once again with<br>five, and uttered a loud roar. Then the king, with a sharp razor-faced<br>arrow, cut off, in that battle, O sire, the bow with arrow fixed thereon<br>and the leathern fence of his antagonist. Casting aside that broken bow,<br>the prince of Pancala, that crusher of foes, quickly took up another bow<br>that was new and capable of bearing a great strain. Blazing with<br>impetuosity, and with eyes red as blood from rage, the great bowman<br>Dhrishtadyumna, with many wounds on his person looked resplendent on his<br>car. Desirous of slaying Duryodhana, O chief of the Bharatas, the Pancala<br>hero sped five and ten cloth-yard shafts that resembled hissing snakes.<br>Those shafts, whetted on stone and equipped with the feathers of Kankas<br>and peacocks, cutting through the armour decked with gold of the king<br>passed through his body and entered the Earth in consequence of the force<br>with which they had been shot. Deeply pierced, O monarch, thy son looked<br>exceedingly beautiful like a gigantic Kinsuka in the season of spring<br>with its flowery weight. His armour pierced with those shafts, and all<br>his limbs rendered exceedingly infirm with wounds, he became filled with<br>rage and cut off Dhrishtadyumna's bow, with a broad-headed arrow. Having<br>cut off his assailant's bow the king then, O monarch, with great speed,<br>struck him with ten shafts on the forehead between the two eyebrows.<br>Those shafts, polished by the hands of the smith, adorned<br>Dhrishtadyumna's face like a number of bees, desirous of honey, adorning<br>a full-blown lotus. Throwing aside that broken bow, the high-souled<br>Dhrishtadyumna quickly took up another, and with it, sixteen broad-headed<br>arrows. With five he slew the four steeds and the driver of Duryodhana,<br>and he cut off with another his bow decked with gold. With the remaining<br>ten shafts, the son of Prishata cut off the car with the upashkara, the<br>umbrella, the dart, the sword, the mace, and the standard of thy son.<br>Indeed, all the kings beheld the beautiful standard of the Kuru king,<br>decked with golden Angadas and bearing the device of an elephant worked<br>in jewels, cut off by the prince of the Pancalas. Then the uterine<br>brothers of Duryodhana, O bull of Bharata's race, rescued the carless<br>Duryodhana who had all his weapons, besides, cut off in that battle. In<br>the very sight of Dhrishtadyumna, Durdhara, O monarch, causing that ruler<br>of men to ride upon his car quickly bore him away from the battle.<br><br>"'Meanwhile the mighty Karna, having vanquished Satyaki and desirous of<br>rescuing the (Kuru) king, proceeded straight against the face of Drona's<br>slayer, that warrior of fierce shafts. The grandson of Sini, however,<br>quickly pursued him from behind, striking him with his arrows, like an<br>elephant pursuing a rival and striking him at the hinder limbs with his<br>tusks. Then, O Bharata, fierce became the battle that raged between the<br>high-souled warriors of the two armies, in the space that intervened<br>between Karna and the son of Prishata. Not a single combatant of either<br>the Pandavas nor ourselves turned his face from the battle. Then Karna<br>proceeded against the Pancalas with great speed. At that hour when the<br>Sun had ascended the meridian, great slaughter, O best of men, of<br>elephants and steeds and men, took place on both sides. The Pancalas, O<br>king, inspired with the desire of victory, all rushed with speed against<br>Karna like birds towards a tree. The son of Adhiratha, of great energy,<br>filled with rage, began from their front to strike those Pancalas, with<br>the keen points of his shafts, singling out their leaders, viz.,<br>Vyaghraketu and Susharma and Citra and Ugrayudha and Jaya and Sukla and<br>Rochamana and the invincible Singhasena. Those heroes, speedily advancing<br>with their cars, encompassed that foremost of men, and poured their<br>shafts upon that angry warrior, viz., Karna, that ornament of battle.<br>That foremost of men endued with great valour, viz., the son of Radha,<br>afflicted those eight heroes engaged in battle with eight keen shafts.<br>The Suta's son possessed of great prowess, O king, then slew many<br>thousands of other warriors skilled in fight. Filled with rage, the son<br>of Radha then slew Jishnu, and Jishnukarman, and Devapi, O king, in that<br>battle, and Citra, and Citrayudha, and Hari, and Singhaketu and Rochamana<br>and the great car-warrior Salabha, and many car-warriors among the Cedis<br>bathed the form of Adhiratha's son in blood, while he himself was engaged<br>in taking the lives of those heroes. There, O Bharata, elephants,<br>assailed with arrows by Karna, fled away on all sides in fear and caused<br>a great agitation on the field of battle. Others assailed with the shafts<br>of Karna, uttered diverse cries, and fell down like mountains riven with<br>thunder. With the fallen bodies of elephants and steeds and men and with<br>fallen cars, the Earth became strewn along the track of Karna's car.<br>Indeed, neither Bhishma, nor Drona, nor any other warrior of thy army had<br>ever achieved such feats as were then achieved by Karna in that battle.<br>Amongst elephants, amongst steeds, amongst cars and amongst men, the<br>Suta's son caused a very great carnage, O tiger among men. As a lion is<br>seen to career fearlessly among a herd of deer, even so Karna careered<br>fearlessly among the Pancalas. As a lion routeth a herd of terrified deer<br>to all points of the compass, even so Karna routed those throngs of<br>Pancala cars to all sides. As a herd of deer that have approached the<br>jaws of a lion can never escape with life, even so those great<br>car-warriors that approached Karna could not escape with their lives. As<br>people are certainly burnt if they come in contact with a blazing fire,<br>even so the Srinjayas, O Bharata, were burnt by the Karna-fire when they<br>came in contact with it. Many warriors among the Cedis and the Pancalas,<br>O Bharata, that were regarded as heroes, were slain by the single-handed<br>Karna in that battle who fought with them, proclaiming his name, in every<br>instance. Beholding the prowess of Karna, O king, I thought that a single<br>Pancala even would not, in that battle, escape from the son of Adhiratha.<br>Indeed, the Suta's son in that battle repeatedly routed the Pancalas.<br><br>"'Beholding Karna thus slaughtering the Pancalas in that dreadful battle,<br>King Yudhishthira the just rushed in wrath towards him; Dhrishtadyumna<br>and the sons of Draupadi also, O sire, and hundreds of warriors,<br>encompassed that slayer of foes viz., the son of Radha. And Shikhandi,<br>and Sahadeva, and Nakula, and Nakula's son, and Janamejaya, and the<br>grandson of Sini, and innumerable Prabhadrakas, all endued with<br>immeasurable energy, advancing with Dhrishtadyumna in their van, looked<br>magnificent as they struck Karna with shafts and diverse weapons. Like<br>Garuda falling upon a large number of snakes, the son of Adhiratha,<br>singlehanded, fell upon all those Cedis and Pancalas and Pandavas in that<br>encounter. The battle that took place between them and Karna, O monarch,<br>became exceedingly fierce like that which had occurred in days of old<br>between the gods and the Danavas. Like the Sun dispelling the surrounding<br>darkness, Karna fearlessly and alone encountered all those great bowmen<br>united together and pouring upon him repeated showers of arrows. While<br>the son of Radha was thus engaged with the Pandavas, Bhimasena, filled<br>with rage, began to slaughter the Kurus with shafts, every one of which<br>resembled the lord of Yama. That great bowman, fighting single-handed<br>with the Bahlikas, and the Kaikayas, the Matsyas, the Vasatas, the<br>Madras, and Saindhavas, looked exceedingly resplendent. There, elephants,<br>assailed in their vital limbs by Bhima with his cloth-yard shafts fell<br>down, with their riders slain, making the Earth tremble with the violence<br>of their fall. Steeds also, with their riders slain, and foot-soldiers<br>deprived of life, lay down, pierced with arrows and vomiting blood in<br>large quantities. Car-warriors in thousands fell down, their weapons<br>loosened from their hands. Inspired with the fear of Bhima, they lay<br>deprived of life, their bodies mangled with sounds. The Earth became<br>strewn with car-warriors and horsemen and elephant-men and drivers and<br>foot-soldiers and steeds and elephants all mangled with the shafts of<br>Bhimasena. The army of Duryodhana, O king, cheerless and mangled and<br>afflicted with the fear of Bhimasena, stood as if stupefied. Indeed that<br>melancholy host stood motionless in that dreadful battle like the Ocean,<br>O king, during a calm in autumn. Stupefied, that host stood even like the<br>Ocean in calm. However endued with wrath and energy and might, the army<br>of thy son then, divested of its pride, lost all its splendour. Indeed,<br>the host, whilst thus being slaughtered became drenched with gore and<br>seemed to bathe in blood. The combatants, O chief of the Bharatas,<br>drenched with blood, were seen to approach and slaughter one another. The<br>Suta's son, filled with rage, routed the Pandava division, while<br>Bhimasena in rage routed the Kurus. And both of them, while thus<br>employed, looked exceedingly resplendent. During the progress of that<br>fierce battle filling the spectators with wonder, Arjuna, that foremost<br>of various persons, having slain a large number of samsaptakas in the<br>midst of their array, addressed Vasudeva, saying, "This struggling force<br>of samsaptakas, O Janardana, is broken. Those great car-warriors amongst<br>the samsaptakas are flying away with their followers, unable to bear my<br>shafts, like deer unable to bear the roar of the lion. The vast force of<br>the Srinjayas also seems to break in this great battle. There that banner<br>of the intelligent Karna, bearing the device of the elephant's rope, O<br>Krishna, is seen in the midst of Yudhishthira's division, where he is<br>careering with activity. The other great car-warriors (of our army) are<br>incapable of vanquishing Karna. Thou knowest that Karna is possessed of<br>great energy as regards prowess in battle. Proceed thither where Karna is<br>routing our force. Avoiding (other warriors) in battle, proceed against<br>the Suta's son, that mighty car-warrior. This is what I wish, O Krishna.<br>Do, however, that which thou likest." Hearing these words of his, Govinda<br>smiled, and addressing Arjuna, said, "Slay the Kauravas, O son of Pandu,<br>without delay." Then those steeds, white as swans, urged by Govinda, and<br>bearing Krishna and the son of Pandu penetrated thy vast force. Indeed,<br>thy host broke on all sides as those white steeds in trappings of gold,<br>urged by Keshava, penetrated into its midst. That ape-bannered car, the<br>clatter of whose wheels resembled the deep roar of the clouds and whose<br>flags waved in the air, penetrated into the host like a celestial car<br>passing through the welkin. Keshava and Arjuna, filled with rage, and<br>with eyes red as blood, as they penetrated, piercing through thy vast<br>host, looked exceedingly resplendent in their splendour. Both delighting<br>in battle, as those two heroes, challenged by the Kurus, came to the<br>field, they looked like the twin Ashvinis invoked with proper rites in a<br>sacrifice by the officiating priests. Filled with rage, the impetuosity<br>of those two tigers among men increased like that of two elephants in a<br>large forest, enraged at the claps of hunters. Having penetrated into the<br>midst of that car-force and those bodies of horse, Phalguna careered<br>within those divisions like the Destroyer himself, armed with the fatal<br>noose. Beholding him put forth such prowess within his army, thy son, O<br>Bharata, once more urged the samsaptakas against him. Thereupon, with a<br>1,000 cars, and 300 elephants, and 14,000 horses, and 200,00 of<br>foot-soldiers armed with the bow, endued with great courage, of sureness<br>of aim and conversant with all the ways of battle, the leaders of the<br>samsaptakas rushed (from every side) towards the son of Kunti (in the<br>great battle) covering the Pandava, O monarch, with showers of arrows<br>from all sides. Thus covered with shafts in that battle, Partha, that<br>grinder of hostile forces, exhibited himself in a fierce form like the<br>Destroyer himself, armed with the noose. While engaged in slaughtering<br>the samsaptakas, Partha became a worthy object of sight to all. Then the<br>welkin became filled with shafts decked with gold and possessed of the<br>effulgence of lightning that were ceaselessly short by the diadem-decked<br>Arjuna. Indeed, everything completely shrouded with mighty shafts sped<br>from Arjuna's arms and falling ceaselessly all around, looked<br>resplendent, O lord, as if covered with snakes. The son of Pandu, of<br>immeasurable soul, shot on all sides his straight shafts equipped with<br>wings of gold and furnished with keen points. In consequence of the sound<br>of Partha's palms, people thought that the Earth, or the vault of the<br>welkin, or all the points of the compass, or the several oceans, or the<br>mountains seemed to split. Having slain 10,000 kshatriyas, Kunti's son,<br>that mighty car-warrior, then quickly proceeded to the further wing of<br>the samsaptakas. Repairing to that further wing which was protected by<br>the Kambojas, Partha began to grind it forcibly with his arrows like<br>Vasava grinding the Danavas. With broad-headed arrows he began to quickly<br>cut off the arms, with weapons in grasp, and also the heads of foes<br>longing to slay him. Deprived of diverse limbs, and of weapons, they<br>began to fall down on the Earth, like trees of many boughs broken by a<br>hurricane. While he was engaged in thus slaughtering elephants and steeds<br>and car-warriors and foot-soldiers, the younger brother of Sudakshina<br>(the chief of the Kambojas) began to pour showers of arrows on him. With<br>a couple of crescent-shaped arrows, Arjuna cut off the two arms, looking<br>like spiked maces, of his striking assailant, and then his head graced<br>with a face as beautiful as the full moon, with a razor-headed arrow.<br>Deprived of life, he fell down from his vehicle, his body bathed in<br>blood, like the thunder-riven summit of a mountain of red arsenic.<br>Indeed, people saw the tall and exceedingly handsome younger brother of<br>Sudakshina, the chief of the Kambojas, of eyes resembling lotus petals,<br>slain and fall down like a column of gold or like a summit of the golden<br>Sumeru. Then commenced a battle there once more that was fierce and<br>exceedingly wonderful. The condition of the struggling combatants varied<br>repeatedly. Each slain with a single arrow, and combatants of the<br>Kamboja, the Yavana, and the Saka races, fell down bathed in blood, upon<br>which the whole field of battle became one expanse of red, O monarch. In<br>consequence of car-warriors deprived of steeds and drivers, and steeds<br>deprived of riders, and elephants deprived of riders, and riders deprived<br>of elephants, battling with one another, O king, a great carnage took<br>place. When the wing and the further wing of the samsaptakas had thus<br>been exterminated by Savyasaci, the son of Drona quickly proceeded<br>against Arjuna, that foremost of victorious warriors. Indeed, Drona's son<br>rushed, shaking his formidable bow, and taking with him many terrible<br>arrows like the Sun himself appearing with his own rays. With mouth wide<br>open from rage and with the desire to retaliate, and with red eyes, the<br>mighty Ashvatthama looked formidable like death himself, armed with his<br>mace and filled with wrath as at the end of the Yuga. He then shot<br>showers of fierce shafts. With those shafts sped by him, he began to rout<br>the Pandava army. As soon as he beheld him of Dasharha's race (Keshava)<br>on the car, O king, he once more sped at him, and repeated showers of<br>fierce shafts. With those falling shafts, O monarch, sped by Drona's son,<br>both Krishna and Dhananjaya were completely shrouded on the car. Then the<br>valiant Ashvatthama, with hundreds of keen arrows, stupefied both Madhava<br>and the son of Pandu in that battle. Beholding those two protectors of<br>all mobile and immobile creatures thus covered with arrows, the universe<br>of mobile and immobile beings uttered cries of "Oh!" and "Alas!" Crowds<br>of Siddhas and Charanas began to repair to that spot from every side,<br>mentally uttering this prayer, viz., "Let good be to all the worlds."<br>Never before, O king, did I see prowess like that of Drona's son in that<br>battle while he was engaged in shrouding the two Krishnas with shafts.<br>The sound of Ashvatthama's bow, inspiring foes with terror, was<br>repeatedly heard by us in that battle, O king, to resemble that of a<br>roaring lion. While careering in that battle and striking right and left<br>the string of his bow looked beautiful like flashes of lightning in the<br>midst of a mass of clouds. Though endued with great firmness and<br>lightness of hand the son of Pandu, for all that, beholding the son of<br>Drona then, became greatly stupefied. Indeed, Arjuna then regarded his<br>own prowess to be destroyed by his high-souled assailant. The form of<br>Ashvatthama became such in that battle that men could with difficulty<br>gaze at it. During the progress of that dreadful battle between Drona's<br>son and the Pandava, during that time when the mighty son of Drona, O<br>monarch, thus prevailed over his antagonist and the son of Kunti lost his<br>energy, Krishna became filled with rage. Inspired with wrath he drew deep<br>breaths, O king, and seemed to burn with his eyes both Ashvatthama and<br>Phalguna as he looked at them repeatedly. Filled with rage, Krishna<br>addressed Partha in an affectionate tone, saying, "This, O Partha, that I<br>behold in battle regarding thee, is exceedingly strange, since Drona's<br>son, O Partha, surpasseth thee today! Hast thou not now the energy and<br>the might of thy arms thou hadst before? Hast thou not that Gandiva still<br>in thy hands, and dost thou not stay on thy car now? Are not thy two arms<br>sound? Hath thy fist suffered any hurt? Why is it then that I see the son<br>of Drona prevail over thee in battle? Do not, O Partha, spare thy<br>assailant, regarding him as the son of thy preceptor, O bull of Bharata's<br>race. This is not the time for sparing him." Thus addressed by Krishna,<br>Partha speedily took up four and ten broad-headed arrows at a time, when<br>speed was of the highest moment, and with them he cut off Ashvatthama's<br>bow and standard and umbrella and banners and car and dart and mace. With<br>a few calf-toothed arrows he then deeply struck the son of Drona in the<br>latter's shoulder. Thereupon overcome with a deep swoon, Ashvatthama sat<br>down, supporting himself on his flagstaff. The latter's driver then, O<br>monarch, desirous of protecting him from Dhananjaya, bore him away<br>insensible and thus deeply afflicted by the foe. Meanwhile that scorcher<br>of foes, viz., Vijaya, slaughtered thy troops by hundreds and thousands,<br>in the very sight of that hero, viz., thy son, O sire. Thus, O king, in<br>consequence of thy evil counsels, a cruel and awful destruction and<br>carnage commenced as thy warriors were engaged with the enemy. Within a<br>short time Vibhatsu routed the samsaptakas: Vrikodara, the Kurus, and<br>Vasusena, the Pancalas. During the progress of the battle destructive of<br>great heroes, there rose many headless trunks all around. Meanwhile<br>Yudhishthira, O chief of the Bharatas, in great pain owing to his wounds,<br>retreating about two miles from the battle, rested himself for some<br>time.'"
