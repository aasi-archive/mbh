                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Vrishasena slain, Karna, filled with grief and<br>rage, shed tears from his eyes for the death of his son. Endued with<br>great energy, with eyes red as copper from rage, Karna proceeded in the<br>face of his foe, having summoned Dhananjaya to battle. Then those two<br>cars, both possessed of solar effulgence and covered with tiger-skins,<br>when they came together, looked like two suns close to each other. Both<br>having white steeds and both crushers of foes, those two great bowmen,<br>those two warriors possessed of solar effulgence, looked resplendent like<br>the sun and the moon in the firmament. Beholding those two warriors that<br>resembled Indra and Virochana's son (Vali) carefully preparing for battle<br>for the conquest of the three worlds, all creatures were filled with<br>wonder. Seeing those two warriors rushing towards each other with the<br>clatter of car-wheels the twang of bows, the sound of palms, the whizz of<br>arrows, and leonine shouts, and seeing also their standards, viz., that<br>of Karna bearing the elephant's rope and that of Partha bearing the ape,<br>approach each other, all the lords of the earth became filled with<br>wonder. Seeing those two car-warriors engaged with each other, O Bharata,<br>all the kings uttered leonine shouts and cheered them repeatedly with<br>applause. Beholding that single combat between Partha and Karna,<br>thousands of combatants there slapped their armpits and waved their<br>garments on the air. The Kauravas beat their musical instruments and blew<br>their numerous conchs for gladdening Karna. Similarly, all the Pandavas,<br>for gladdening Dhananjaya, caused every point of the compass to resound<br>with the blasts of their trumpets and conchs. With those leonine shouts<br>and slaps on armpits and other loud cries and roars of brave warriors,<br>tremendous became the noise there on the occasion of that encounter<br>between Karna and Arjuna. People beheld those two tigers among men, those<br>two foremost of car-warriors, stationed on their cars, each armed with<br>his formidable bow, each equipped with arrows and darts, and each owning<br>a lofty standard. Both were clad in mail, both had scimitars tied to<br>their belts, both had white steeds, and both were adorned with excellent<br>conchs. One had Krishna for driver on his car, and the other had Shalya.<br>Both of them were great car-warriors and both looked alike. Both<br>possessed of leonine necks and long arms, the eyes of both were red, and<br>both were adorned with garlands of gold. Both were armed with bows that<br>seemed to flash like lightning, and both were adorned with wealth of<br>weapons. Both had yak-tails for being fanned therewith, and both were<br>decked with white umbrellas held over them. Both had excellent quivers<br>and both looked exceedingly handsome. The limbs of both were smeared with<br>red sandal-paste and both looked like infuriated bulls. Both were<br>broad-necked like the lion, both were broad-chested, and both endued with<br>great strength. Challenging each other, O king, each desired to slay the<br>other. And they rushed against each other like two mighty bulls in a<br>cow-pen. They were like a couple of infuriated elephants or of angry<br>mountains or of infant snakes of virulent poison or of all-destroying<br>Yamas. Enraged with each other like Indra and Vritra, they looked like<br>the sun and the moon in splendour. Filled with wrath, they resembled two<br>mighty planets risen for the destruction of the world at the end of the<br>Yuga. Both of them born of celestial fathers, and both resembling gods in<br>beauty, they were of godlike energy. Indeed, they looked like the sun and<br>the moon come of their own accord on the field of battle. Both of them<br>endued with great might, both filled with pride in battle, they were<br>armed with diverse weapons. Beholding those two tigers among men, those<br>two heroes endued with the impetuosity of tigers, thy troops, O monarch,<br>were filled with great joy. Seeing those two tigers amongst men, viz.,<br>Karna and Dhananjaya, engaged in battle, a doubt entered the hearts of<br>all as to which of them would be victorious. Both armed with superior<br>weapons, and both well-practised in battle, both made the welkin resound<br>with the slaps on their armpits. Both possessed of great celebrity in<br>consequence of prowess and might, they resembled the Asura Samvara and<br>the chief of the celestials in respect of their skill in battle. Both<br>equal to Kartavirya or Dasaratha's son in battle, both resembled Vishnu<br>himself in energy or Bhava himself in fight. Both had white steeds, O<br>king, and both were borne on foremost of cars. Both of them, again, had<br>foremost of drivers in that great battle. Beholding, O monarch, those two<br>great car-warriors looking resplendent on their cars, the bands of<br>Siddhas and Charanas that came there became filled with wonder. The<br>Dhartarashtras then, O bull of Bharata's race, with their troops,<br>encompassed the high-souled Karna, that ornament of battle, without<br>losing any time. Similarly the Pandavas headed by Dhrishtadyumna, filled<br>with joy, encompassed that high-souled Partha who was unrivalled in<br>battle. Karna became the stake, O monarch, of thy army in that battle,<br>while Partha became the stake of the Pandavas. The soldiers of both sides<br>were as members of that assembly and became the spectators of that game.<br>Indeed, as regards the parties engaged in that game of battle, either<br>victory or defeat was certain. Those two then, Karna and Arjuna, for<br>victory or the reverse, began the match between ourselves and the<br>Pandavas both standing on the field of battle. Skilled in fight, the two<br>heroes, O monarch, in that encounter, became highly enraged with each<br>other and wished to slay each other. Desiring to take each other's life,<br>like Indra and Vritra, O lord, they faced each other like two mighty<br>comets of terrible form. Then in the sky, differences and disputes,<br>accompanied with revilings, arose among the creatures there, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, on the subject of Karna and Arjuna. All the inhabitants<br>of the world, O sire, were heard to differ amongst themselves. The gods,<br>the Danavas, the Gandharvas, the Pishacas, the Snakes, the Rakshasas,<br>adopted opposite sides in that encounter between Karna and Arjuna. The<br>welkin, O monarch, with all the stars, became anxious on Karna's account,<br>while the wide earth became so on Partha's account, like the mother for<br>her son. The rivers, the seas, the mountains, O best of men, the trees,<br>the deciduous plants and herbs, took the side of the diadem-decked<br>Arjuna. The Asuras, Yatudhanas, the Guhyakas, O scorcher of foes, and<br>ravens and other rangers of the sky, sided with Karna. All the gems and<br>precious jewels, the four Vedas with the histories as the fifth, the<br>Upavedas, the Upanishads, with all their mysteries, and the compilations,<br>and Vasuki, and Citrasena, and Takshaka, and Upatakshaka, and all the<br>mountains, and all the offspring of Kadru with their children, all the<br>great snakes endued with poison, and the Nagas, took the side of Arjuna.<br>Airavata and his children, the offspring of Surabhi, the offspring of<br>Vaisali, and the Bhogins sided with Arjuna. The smaller snakes all sided<br>with Karna. Wolves and wild stags and all kinds of auspicious animals and<br>birds were, O king, for victory to Partha. The Vasus, the Maruts, the<br>Sadhyas, the Rudras, the Vishvedevas and the Ashvinis, and Agni and Indra<br>and Soma and Pavana, and the ten points of the compass, became the<br>partisans of Dhananjaya, while all the Adityas sided with Karna. The<br>vaishyas, the shudras, the Sutas, and those castes that were of a mixed<br>origin, all, O king, adopted the side of Radha's son. The celestials,<br>however, with the pitris, and with all that were numbered with them as<br>also with their followers, and Yama and Vaishravana and Varuna were on<br>the side of Arjuna. The brahmanas, the kshatriyas, the sacrifices, and<br>those gifts called dakshinas, were for Arjuna. The pretas, and pishacas,<br>many carnivorous animals and birds, the rakshasas with all the monsters<br>of the sea, the dogs, and the jackals were for Karna. The diverse tribes<br>of celestial and regenerate and royal rishis were for the son of Pandu.<br>The gandharvas headed by Tumvuru, O king, were on the side of Arjuna.<br>With the offspring of Pradha and Mauni, the several classes of gandharvas<br>and apsaras, and many wise sages, having for their vehicles wolves and<br>stags and elephants and steeds and cars and foot, and clouds and the<br>wind, came there for witnessing the encounter between Karna and Arjuna.<br>The gods, the danavas, the gandharvas, the nagas, the yakshas, the birds,<br>the great rishis versed in the Vedas, the pitris that subsist upon the<br>gifts called svadha, and asceticism and the sciences, and the (celestial)<br>herbs with diverse virtues, came, O monarch, and took up their stations<br>in the welkin, making a great noise. Brahman, with the regenerate rishis<br>and the Lords of creatures, and Bhava himself on his car, came to that<br>part of the welkin. Beholding those two high-souled ones, Karna and<br>Dhananjaya, about to encounter each other, Shakra himself said, "Let<br>Arjuna vanquish Karna." Surya, however, said, "Let Karna vanquish Arjuna.<br>Indeed, let my son Karna, slaying Arjuna, gain the victory in this<br>battle. Let my son, slaying Karna, win victory." Even thus did Surya and<br>Vasava, those two foremost of personages, who were there and had adopted<br>opposite sides, dispute with each other. Beholding those two high-souled<br>ones, Karna and Dhananjaya, about to engage themselves in battle, the<br>gods and the asuras adopted opposite sides. The three worlds with the<br>celestial rishis and all the gods and all other creatures, trembled at<br>the sight. The gods were on the side of Partha, while the asuras were on<br>that of Karna. Thus all creatures were interested in that encounter,<br>siding with this or that leader of car-warriors, the Kuru or the Pandava<br>hero. Beholding the Self-born Lord of Creation (viz., Brahman), the gods<br>urged him, saying, "Let, O god, the success of these two lions among men<br>be equal. Let not the vast universe be destroyed in consequence of this<br>encounter between Karna and Arjuna. O Selfborn one, say but the word, let<br>the success of these two be equal." Hearing these words, Maghavat, bowing<br>down unto the Grandsire, represented this unto that god of gods, that<br>foremost one of all intelligent beings, saying, "Formerly it was said by<br>thy holy self that the two Krishnas are always sure to win victory. Let<br>it be (now) as thou then saidest. Be gratified with me, O holy one!" At<br>this, Brahman and Isana replied unto the chief of the celestials, saying,<br>'The victory of the high-souled Vijaya is certain, of that Savyasaci who<br>gratified the eater of sacrificial libations in the forest of Khandava<br>and who, coming to heaven, rendered assistance to thee, O Sakra! Karna is<br>on the side of the Danavas. It is proper, therefore, that he should meet<br>with defeat. By this, without doubt, the purposes of the gods will be<br>achieved. One's own business, O chief of the celestials, should always be<br>important. The high-souled Phalguna, again, is devoted to truth and to<br>morality. He must always be victorious, without doubt. He by whom the<br>high-souled and holy god having the bull on his standard was gratified,<br>why should not he, O thou of a hundred eyes, be victorious,&#8212;he, that is,<br>who hath for the driver of his car that Lord of the universe, Vishnu<br>himself? Possessed of great energy of mind and great strength, Partha is<br>a hero, accomplished in arms and endued with ascetic merit. Possessed<br>also of great energy of body, he beareth the entire science of weapons.<br>Indeed, Partha hath every accomplishment. He ought to be victorious,<br>since that would accomplish the purposes of the gods. In consequence of<br>his greatness, Partha transgresses destiny itself, whether favourable or<br>unfavourable, and when he does so, a great destruction of creatures takes<br>place. When the two Krishnas are excited with wrath, they show regard for<br>nothing. These two bulls among beings are the Creators of all real and<br>unreal things. These two are Nara and Narayana, the two ancient and best<br>of Rishis. There is none to rule over them. They are rulers over all,<br>perfectly fearless, they are scorchers of all foes. In heaven or among<br>human beings, there is none equal to either of them. The three worlds<br>with the celestial Rishis and the Charanas are behind these two. All the<br>gods and all creatures walk behind them. The entire universe exists in<br>consequence of the power of these two. Let Karna, that bull among men,<br>obtain these foremost of regions of bliss here. Let him obtain identity<br>with the Vasus or the Maruts. Let him, with Drona and Bhishma, be<br>worshipped in heaven, for Vikartana's son is brave and is a hero. Let the<br>victory, however, belong to the two Krishnas." After those two foremost<br>ones among the gods (Brahman and Isana), said so, the deity of a 1,000<br>eyes, worshipping those words of Brahman and Isana and saluting all<br>creatures himself said, "Ye have heard what has been said by the two gods<br>for the benefit of the universe. It will be even so and not otherwise.<br>Stay ye then, with cheerful hearts." Hearing these words of Indra, all<br>creatures, O sire, became filled with wonder and applauded, O king, that<br>deity. The celestials then showered diverse kinds of fragrant flowers and<br>blew their trumpets. Indeed, the gods, the Danavas and the Gandharvas all<br>waited there for witnessing that matchless single combat between those<br>two lions among men. The two cars, O king, upon which Karna and Arjuna<br>were stationed, had white steeds yoked unto them both. And both had<br>excellent standards, and both produced a loud rattle. Many foremost of<br>heroes, approaching the brave Vasudeva and Arjuna as also Shalya and<br>Karna, began each to blow his conch. The battle then commenced (between<br>the two warriors), overwhelming all timid persons with fear. Fiercely<br>they challenged each other like Sakra and Samvara. The standards of the<br>two heroes, perfectly bright, looked exceedingly beautiful on their cars,<br>like the planets Rahu and Ketu risen in the firmament at the time of the<br>universal dissolution. The elephant's rope on Karna's banner, looking<br>like a snake of virulent poison and made of jewels and gems and<br>exceedingly strong and resembling the bow of Indra, looked resplendent<br>(as it waved in the air). That foremost of apes, again, belonging to<br>Partha, with jaws wide open and terrible, and difficult of being gazed<br>at, like the sun himself, inspired fear by his formidable teeth. The<br>impetuous Ape on the standard of the wielder of Gandiva, becoming<br>desirous of battle, rushed from his station and fell upon Karna's<br>standard. Endued with great impetuosity, the Ape, darting forward, struck<br>the elephant's rope with his nails and teeth, like Garuda falling upon a<br>snake. Decked with rows of little bells, hard as iron, and resembling the<br>fatal noose (in the hands of Yama or Varuna), the elephant's rope, filled<br>with wrath, closed with the Ape. Thus in that fierce single combat<br>between those two heroes, which was the result of what had been settled<br>at the time of the match at dice, their standards first battled with each<br>other. Meanwhile the steeds of the one neighed at the steeds of the<br>other. The lotus-eyed Keshava pierced Shalya with his keen glances. The<br>latter also cast similar glances at the former. Vasudeva, however,<br>vanquished Shalya with those glances of his, while Dhananjaya, the son of<br>Kunti, vanquished Karna with his glances. Then the Suta's son, smilingly<br>addressing Shalya, said, "If Partha by any means slays me in battle<br>today, tell me truly, O friend, what thou wilt do after that." Shalya<br>answered, saying, "If thou art slain, I myself will slay both Krishna and<br>Dhananjaya." Once more the ruler of the Madras said, "If, O Karna, the<br>white steeded Arjuna slays thee in battle today, I myself, on a single<br>car, will slay both Madhava and Phalguna.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Arjuna also asked Govinda a similar question.<br>Krishna, however, smiling, said unto Partha these words of grave import,<br>"The Sun himself may fall down from his place, the Earth herself may<br>split into a 1,000 fragments; fire itself may become cold. Still Karna<br>will not be able to slay thee, O Dhananjaya! If, however, any such<br>occurrence takes place, know then that the destruction of the universe<br>will be at hand. As regards myself, I will, using my bare arms, slay both<br>Karna and Shalya in battle." Hearing these words of Krishna, the<br>ape-bannered Arjuna, smiling, replied unto Krishna who was never fatigued<br>with exertion, saying, "Shalya and Karna, united together, are not a<br>match for myself alone, O Janardana! Thou shalt today, O Krishna, behold<br>Karna with his standard and banners with Shalya and his car and steeds,<br>with his umbrella and armour and darts and shafts and bow, cut in pieces<br>with my shafts in battle. Thou shalt today behold him with his car and<br>steeds and darts and armour and weapons, reduced to dust like a tree in<br>the forest crushed by a tusker. Today the widowhood of the wives of<br>Radha's son is at hand. Verily, they must have in their (last night's)<br>dreams seen signs of approaching evil, O Mahadeva! Verily, thou shalt<br>today see the wives of Karna become widows. I cannot restrain my wrath at<br>what was done before now by this fool of little foresight when he beheld<br>Krishna dragged to the assembly and when laughing at us he abused us<br>repeatedly in vile words. Today, O Govinda, thou shalt behold Karna<br>crushed by me like a tree with its load of flowers crushed by an<br>infuriated elephant. Today, O slayer of Madhu, thou shalt, after Karna's<br>fall, hear those sweet words, 'By good luck, O thou of Vrishni's race,<br>victory hath been thine!' Thou shalt today comfort the mother of<br>Abhimanyu with a lighter heart for having paid thy debt to the foe. Today<br>thou shalt, filled with joy, comfort thy paternal aunt Kunti. Today thou<br>shalt, O Madhava, comfort Krishna of tearful face and king Yudhishthira<br>the just with words sweet as nectar."'"
