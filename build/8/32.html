                            "Sanjaya said, 'Thy son then, O monarch, humbly approaching that mighty<br>car-warrior, viz., the ruler of the Madras, addressed him, from<br>affection, in these words, "O thou of true vows, O thou of great good<br>fortune, O enhancer of the sorrows of foes, O ruler of the Madras, O hero<br>in battle, O thou that inspirest hostile troops with fear, thou hast<br>heard, O foremost of speakers, how, for the sake of Karna who spoke unto<br>me, I myself am desirous of soliciting thee among all these lions of<br>kings. O thou of incomparable prowess, O king of the Madras, for the<br>destruction of the foe, I solicit thee today, with humility and bow of<br>the head. Therefore, for the destruction of Partha and for my good, it<br>behoveth thee, O foremost of car-warriors, to accept, from love, the<br>office of charioteer. With thee for his driver, the son of Radha will<br>subjugate my foes. There is none else for holding the reins of Karna's<br>steeds, except thee, O thou of great good fortune, thou that art the<br>equal of Vasudeva in battle. Protect Karna then by every means like<br>Brahma protecting Maheswara. Even as he of Vrishni's race protects by<br>every means the son of Pandu in all dangers, do thou, O chief of the<br>Madras, protect the son of Radha today. Bhishma, and Drona, and Kripa,<br>and thyself and the valiant ruler of the Bhojas, and Shakuni the son of<br>Subala, and Drona's son and myself, constituted the chief strength of our<br>army. Even thus, O lord of Earth, we had divided amongst ourselves the<br>hostile army into portion for the share of each. The share that had been<br>allotted to Bhishma is now no more as also that which had been allotted<br>to the high-souled Drona. Going even beyond their allotted shares, those<br>two slew my foes. Those two tigers among men, however, were old, and both<br>of them have been slain deceitfully. Having achieved the most difficult<br>feats, both of them, O sinless one, have departed hence to heaven.<br>Similarly, many other tigers among men, of our army, slain by foes in<br>battle, have ascended to heaven, casting off their lives and having made<br>great exertions to the best of their powers. This my host, therefore, O<br>king, the greater portion of which has been slaughtered, has been reduced<br>to this state by the Parthas who were at first fewer than us. What should<br>be done for the present? Do that now, O lord of Earth, by which the<br>mighty and the high-souled sons of Kunti, of prowess incapable of being<br>baffled, may be prevented from exterminating the remnant of my host. O<br>lord, the Pandavas have in battle slain the bravest warriors of this my<br>force. The mighty-armed Karna alone is devoted to our good, as also<br>thyself, O tiger among men, that art the foremost of car-warriors in the<br>whole world. O Shalya, Karna wishes to contend in battle today with<br>Arjuna. On him, O ruler of the Madras, my hopes of victory are great.<br>There is none else in the world (save thee) that can make so good a<br>holder of the reins for Karna. As Krishna is the foremost of all holders<br>of reins for Partha in battle, even so, O king, be thou the foremost of<br>all holders of reins for Karna's car. Accompanied and protected, O sire,<br>by him in battle, the feats that Partha achieve are all before thee.<br>Formerly, Arjuna had never slain his foes in battle in such a way. Now<br>however, his prowess has become great, united as he is with Krishna. Day<br>after day, O ruler of the Madras, this vast Dhritarashtra force is seen<br>to be routed by Partha because he is united with Krishna. A portion<br>remains of the share allotted to Karna and thyself, O thou of great<br>splendour. Bear that share with Karna, and destroy it unitedly in battle.<br>Even as Surya, uniting with Aruna, destroys the darkness, do thou,<br>uniting with Karna, slay Partha in battle. Let the mighty car-warriors<br>(of the enemy), fly away, beholding in battle those two warriors endued<br>with the effulgence of the morning sun, viz., Karna and Shalya,<br>resembling two Suns risen above the horizon. Even as darkness is<br>destroyed, O sire, at the sight of Surya and Aruna, even so let the<br>Kaunteyas (Pandavas) with the Pancalas and the Srinjayas perish beholding<br>thee and Karna. Karna is the foremost of car-warriors, and thou art the<br>foremost of drivers. In the clash of battle, again there is none equal to<br>thee. As he of Vrishni's race protects the son of Pandu under all<br>circumstances, even so let thyself protect Vikarna's son Karna in battle.<br>With thee as his driver, Karna will become invincible, O king, in battle<br>even with the gods having Sakra at their head! What then need be said<br>about the Pandavas? Do not doubt my words.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing these words of Duryodhana, Shalya, became<br>filled with rage. Contracting his brow into three lines, and waving his<br>arms repeatedly, and rolling his large eyes red in wrath, that warrior of<br>massive arms proud of his lineage and wealth and knowledge and strength,<br>said these words:<br><br>"'Shalya said "Thou insultest me, O son of Gandhari, or without doubt<br>suspectest me, since thou solicitest me, without hesitation, saying, 'Act<br>thou as a driver.' Regarding Karna to be superior to ourselves, thou<br>applaudest him thus. I, however, do not regard the son of Radha as my<br>equal in battle. Assign to me a much greater share, O lord of Earth.<br>Destroying that in battle, I will return to the place I come from. Or, if<br>thou wishest, I will, O delighter of the Kurus, contend, single-handed,<br>with the enemy. While engaged in consuming the foe, behold thou my<br>prowess today. Brooding upon an insult, O thou of Kuru's race, a person<br>like ourselves never engageth in my task. Do not have thy doubts about<br>me. Never shouldst thou humiliate me in battle. Behold these two massive<br>arms of mine, strong as the thunder. Behold also my excellent bow, and<br>these shafts that resemble snakes of virulent poison. Behold my car, unto<br>which are yoked excellent steeds endued with the speed of the wind.<br>Behold also, O son of Gandhari, my mace decked with gold and twined with<br>hempen chords. Filled with wrath, I can split the very Earth, scatter the<br>mountains, and dry up the oceans, with my own energy, O king. Knowing me,<br>O monarch, to be so capable, of afflicting the foe, why dost thou appoint<br>me to the office of driver in battle for such a low-born person as<br>Adhiratha's son? It behoveth thee not, O king of kings, to set me to such<br>mean tasks! Being so superior, I cannot make up my mind to obey the<br>commands of a sinful person. He that causeth a superior person arrived of<br>his own will and obedient from love, to yield to a sinful wight,<br>certainly incurreth the sin of confusing the superior with the inferior.<br>Brahman created the brahmanas from his mouth, and the kshatriyas from his<br>arms. He created the Vaishyas from his thighs and the Shudras from his<br>feet. In consequence of the intermixture of those four orders, O Bharata,<br>from those four have sprung particular classes, viz., those born of men<br>of superior classes wedding women of classes inferior to themselves, and<br>vice versa. The kshatriyas have been described to be protectors (of the<br>other classes) acquirers of wealth and givers of the same. The brahmanas<br>have been established on the Earth for the sake of favouring its people<br>by assisting at sacrifices, by teaching and acceptance of pure gifts.<br>Agriculture and tending of cattle and gift are the occupations of the<br>Vaishyas according to the scriptures. Shudras have been ordained to be<br>the servants of the brahmanas, the kshatriyas, and the vaishyas.<br>Similarly, the Sutas are the servants of kshatriyas, and not latter the<br>servants of the former. Listen to these my words, O sinless one. As<br>regards myself, I am one whose coronal locks have undergone the sacred<br>bath. I am born in a race of royal sages. I am reckoned a great<br>car-warrior. I deserve the worship and the praises that bards and<br>eulogists render and sing. Being all this, O slayer of hostile troops, I<br>cannot go to the extent of acting as the driver of the Suta's son in<br>battle. I will never fight, undergoing an act of humiliation. I ask thy<br>permission, O son of Gandhari, for returning home."<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Having said these words that tiger among men and<br>ornament of assemblies, viz., Shalya, filled with rage stood up quickly<br>and endeavoured to get away from that concourse of kings. Thy son,<br>however, from affection and great regard, held the king, and addressed<br>him in these sweet and conciliatory words, that were capable of<br>accomplishing every object, "Without doubt, O Shalya, it is even so as<br>thou hast said. But I have a certain purpose in view. Listen to it, O<br>ruler of men, Karna is not superior to thee, nor do I suspect thee, O<br>king. The royal chief of the Madras will never do that which is false.<br>Those foremost of men that were thy ancestors always told the truth. I<br>think it is for this that thou art called Artayani (the descendant of<br>those that had truth for their refuge). And since, O giver of honours,<br>thou art like a barbed arrow to thy foes, therefore art thou called by<br>the name of Shalya on earth. O thou that makest large present (to<br>brahmanas) at sacrifices, do thou accomplish all that which, O virtuous<br>one, thou hadst previously said thou wouldst accomplish. Neither the son<br>of Radha nor myself am superior to thee in valour that I would select<br>thee as the driver of those foremost of steeds (that are yoked unto<br>Karna's car). As, however, O sire, Karna is superior to Dhananjaya in<br>regard to many qualities, even so doth the world regard thee to be<br>superior to Vasudeva. Karna is certainly superior to Partha in the matter<br>of weapons, O bull among men. Thou too art superior to Krishna in<br>knowledge of steeds and might. Without doubt O ruler of the Madras, thy<br>knowledge of horse is double that which the high-souled Vasudeva hath."<br><br>"'Shalya said, "Since, O son of Gandhari, thou describest me, O thou of<br>Kuru's race, in the midst of all these troops, to be superior to Devaki's<br>son, I am gratified with thee. I will become the driver of Radha's son of<br>great fame while he will be engaged in battle with the foremost one of<br>Pandu's sons, as thou solicitest me. Let this, however, O hero, be my<br>understanding with Vikartana's son that I will in his presence utter<br>whatever speeches I desire.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'O king, thy son, with Karna then, O Bharata,<br>answered the prince of the Madras, O best of Bharata's race, saying, "So<br>be it."'"
