                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'After having obtained the command of the army, and<br>after he had been addressed by the king himself in those sweet and<br>brotherly words, and after he had ordered the troops to be arrayed at the<br>hour of sunrise, tell me, O Sanjaya, what did Vikartana's son Karna do?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Having learnt Karna's wishes, thy sons, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, ordered the troops to be arrayed with joyful music. While<br>it still wanted a long period for the coming of the dawn, a loud noise of<br>"Array, Array!" O king, suddenly arose among thy troops. And the uproar<br>that arose, became tremendous and touched the very heavens, of foremost<br>of elephants and fenced cars while under process of equipment, of<br>foot-soldiers and steeds, O monarch, while putting on their armour or in<br>course of being harnessed, and of combatants moving with activity and<br>shouting unto one another! Then the Suta's son bearing a gold-backed bow<br>appeared (on the field) in his car possessed of the splendour of the<br>radiant Sun, crowned with many banners, equipped with a white standard,<br>with steeds of the hue of cranes, bearing the device of the elephants'<br>rope, filled with a hundred quivers, furnished with mace and wooden<br>fence, freighted with shataghnis and rows of bells and darts and lances<br>and spears, and supplied with many bows. And the Suta's son appeared on<br>the field, blowing his conch, O king; decorated with a net-work of gold,<br>and shaking his formidable bow adorned with pure gold. Beholding the<br>mighty bowman Karna, that foremost of car-warriors, seated on his car,<br>difficult of approach and resembling the risen Sun that destroys the<br>gloom, none amongst the Kauravas, O tiger among men, recked, O sire, the<br>loss of Bhishma or Drona or other men! Speeding the warriors, O sire,<br>with the blasts of his conch, Karna caused the vast army of the Kauravas<br>to be drawn out. Having arrayed the troops in the makara array, that<br>mighty bowman, that scorcher of foes, viz., Karna, proceeded against the<br>Pandavas from desire of victory. In the tip of the beak of that makara, O<br>king, was stationed Karna himself. In the two eyes were the brave Shakuni<br>and the mighty car-warrior Uluka. In the head was Drona's son and in the<br>neck were all the uterine brothers. In the middle was king Duryodhana<br>supported by a large force. In the left foot, O monarch, was stationed<br>Kritavarma accompanied by the Narayana troops, and those invincible<br>warriors, the gopalas. In the right foot, O king, was Gotama's son of<br>prowess incapable of being baffled, surrounded by those mighty bowmen<br>viz., the Trigartas and by the Southerners. In the left hind-foot was<br>stationed Shalya with a large force raised in the country of Madras. In<br>the right (hind-foot), O monarch, was Sushena of true vows, surrounded by<br>a 1,000 cars and 300 elephants. In the tail were the two royal brothers<br>of mighty energy, viz., Citra and Citrasena surrounded by a large force.<br><br>"'When, O great king, that foremost of men, Karna, thus came out, king<br>Yudhishthira the just, casting his eyes on Arjuna, said these words:<br>"Behold, O Partha, how the Dhartarashtra force, O hero, in this battle,<br>protected by heroes and mighty car-warriors, hath been arrayed by Karna!<br>This vast Dhartarashtra force hath lost its bravest warriors. They that<br>remain, O mighty-armed one, are feeble, equal, as I think, to straw! Only<br>one great bowman, viz., the Suta's son, shineth in it! That foremost of<br>car-warriors is incapable of being vanquished by the three worlds with<br>their mobile and immobile creatures, including the gods, Asuras and<br>Gandharvas, and the Kinnaras and great serpents! If thou slayest him<br>today, O mighty-armed one, the victory will be thine, O Phalguna! The<br>thorn also which for twelve years hath been planted in my heart will then<br>be plucked out! Knowing this, O thou of mighty arms, form thou the array<br>that thou wishest!" Hearing those words of his brother, that Pandava of<br>the white steeds disposed his army in counter array after the form of the<br>half moon. On the left side was stationed Bhimasena, and on the right was<br>stationed the great bowman Dhrishtadyumna. In the middle of the array<br>were the king and Dhananjaya the son of Pandu. Nakula and Sahadeva were<br>at the rear of king Yudhishthira the just. The two Pancala princes,<br>Yudhamanyu and Uttamauja, became the protectors of (Arjuna's) car wheels.<br>Protected by the diadem-decked Arjuna himself, they did not quit Arjuna<br>for a moment. The remaining kings, possessed of great courage, clad in<br>mail, stood in the array, each in the position assigned to him, according<br>to the measure of his enthusiasm and resolution, O Bharata. Having thus<br>formed their great array, O Bharata, the Pandavas, and the mighty bowmen<br>of thy army set their hearts on battle. Beholding thy army disposed into<br>battle array by the Suta's son in battle Duryodhana with all his brethren<br>regarded the Pandavas to be already slain. Similarly Yudhishthira, O<br>king, beholding the Pandava army disposed in array, regarded the<br>Dhartarashtras with Karna to be already slain. Then conches, and<br>kettle-drums, and tabours, and large drums, and cymbals, and Dindimas,<br>and Jharjharas, were loudly blown and beaten on all sides! Indeed, those<br>loud-sounding instruments were blown and beaten, O king, among both the<br>armies. Leonine roars also arose, uttered by brave warriors for victory.<br>And there also arose, O king, the noise of neighing steeds and grunting<br>elephants, and the fierce clatter of car-wheels. None, O Bharata, (in the<br>Kaurava army), at that time, felt the loss of Drona, seeing the great<br>bowman Karna clad in mail and stationed at the head of the array. Both<br>armies, O monarch, teeming with joyous men, stood, eager for battle and<br>(ready) to destroy each other without delay. There, the two heroes, viz.,<br>Karna and the son of Pandu, excited with wrath at sight of each other,<br>and both firmly resolved, stood or careered, O king, through their<br>respective divisions. The two armies, as they advanced to meet each<br>other, seemed to dance (in joy). From the wings and the side-wings of<br>both, warriors desirous of battle came forth. Then commenced the battle,<br>O monarch, of men, elephants, steeds, and cars, engaged in destroying one<br>another.'"
