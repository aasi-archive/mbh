                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'When Pandya had been slain and when that foremost<br>of heroes, viz., Karna was employed in routing and destroying the foe,<br>what, O Sanjaya, did Arjuna do in battle? That son of Pandu is a hero,<br>endued with great might, attentive to his duties, and a complete master<br>of the science of arms. The high-souled Sankara himself hath made him<br>invincible among all creatures. My greatest fears proceed from that<br>Dhananjaya, that slayer of foes. Tell me, O Sanjaya, all that Partha<br>achieved there on that occasion.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'After Pandya's fall, Krishna quickly said unto Arjuna<br>these beneficial words, "I do not behold the King. The other Pandavas<br>also have retreated. If the Parthas had returned, the vast force of the<br>enemy would have been broken. In fulfilment of purposes entertained by<br>Ashvatthama, Karna is slaying the Srinjayas. A great carnage is being<br>made (by that warrior) of steeds and car-warriors and elephants." Thus<br>the heroic Vasudeva represented everything unto the diadem-decked<br>(Arjuna). Hearing of and beholding that great danger of his brother<br>(Yudhishthira), Partha quickly addressed Krishna, saying, "Urge the<br>steeds, O Hrishikesha." Then Hrishikesha proceeded on that irresistible<br>car. The encounter then that once more took place became exceedingly<br>fierce. The Kurus and the Pandavas once more fearlessly closed with each<br>other, that is, the Parthas headed by Bhimasena and ourselves headed by<br>the Suta's son. Then, O best of kings, there once more commenced a battle<br>between Karna and the Pandavas that swelled the population of Yama's<br>kingdom. With bows and arrows and spiked clubs and swords and lances and<br>axes and short clubs and Bhushundis and darts and rapiers and battle-axes<br>and maces and spears and polished Kuntas, and short shafts and hooks, the<br>combatants quickly fell upon one another, desirous of taking one<br>another's life. Filling the welkin, the cardinal points of the compass,<br>the subsidiary ones, the firmament, and the Earth, with the whizz of<br>arrows, the twang of bow-strings, the sound of palms, and the clatter of<br>car-wheels, foes rushed upon foes. Gladdened by that loud noise, heroes,<br>fought with heroes desirous of reaching the end of the hostilities. Loud<br>became the noise caused by the sound of bow-strings and fences and bows,<br>the grunt of elephants, and the shouts of foot-soldiers and falling men.<br>Hearing the terrible whizz of arrows and the diverse shouts of brave<br>warriors, the troops took fright, became pale, and fell down. Large<br>numbers of those foes thus employed in shouting and shooting weapons, the<br>heroic son of Adhiratha crushed with his arrows. With his shafts Karna<br>then despatched to Yama's abode twenty car-warriors among the brave<br>Pancala heroes, with their steeds, drivers, and standards. Then many<br>foremost of warriors of the Pandava army, endued with great energy and<br>quick in the use of weapons, speedily wheeling round, encompassed Karna<br>on all sides. Karna agitated that hostile force with showers of weapons<br>like the leader of an elephantine herd plunging into a lake adorned with<br>lotuses and covered with swans. Penetrating into the midst of his foes,<br>the son of Radha, shaking his best of bows, began to strike off and fell<br>their heads with his sharp shafts. The shield and coats of mail of the<br>warriors, cut off, fell down on the Earth. There was none amongst them<br>that needed the touch of a second arrow of Karna's. Like a driver<br>striking the steeds with the whip, Karna, with his shafts capable of<br>crushing coats of mail and bodies and the life that quickened them,<br>struck the fences (of his foes) perceivable only by their bow-strings.<br>Like a lion grinding herds of deer, Karna speedily grinded all those<br>Pandus and Srinjayas and Pancalas that came within range of his arrows.<br>Then the chief of the Pancalas, and the sons of Draupadi, O sire, and the<br>twins, and Yuyudhana, uniting together, proceeded against Karna. When<br>those Kurus, and Pancalas and Pandus were thus engaged in battle, the<br>other warriors, reckless of their very lives, began to strike at one<br>another. Well-cased in armour and coats of mail and adorned with<br>head-gears, combatants endued with great strength rushed at their foes,<br>with maces and short clubs and spiked bludgeons looking like uplifted<br>rods of the Destroyer, and jumping, O sire, and challenging one another,<br>uttered loud shouts. They struck one another, and fell down, assailed by<br>one another with blood rising from their limbs and deprived of brains and<br>eyes and weapons. Covered with weapons, some, as they lay there with<br>faces beautiful as pomegranates, having teeth-adorned mouths filled with<br>blood, seemed to be alive. Others, in that vast ocean of battle, filled<br>with rage mangled or cut or pierced or overthrew or lopped off or slew<br>one another with battle-axes and short arrows and hooks and spears and<br>lances. Slain by one another they fell down, covered with blood and<br>deprived of life like sandal trees cut down with the axe falling down and<br>shedding as they fall their cool blood-red juice. Cars destroyed by cars,<br>elephants by elephants, men by men, and steeds by steeds, fell down in<br>thousands. Standards, and heads, and umbrellas, and elephants, trunks,<br>and human arms, cut off with razor-faced or broad-headed or<br>crescent-shaped arrows, fell down on the Earth. Large numbers also of<br>men, and elephants, and cars with steed yoked thereto, were crushed in<br>that battle. Many brave warriors, slain by horsemen, fell down, and many<br>tuskers, with their trunks cut off, and banners and standards (on their<br>bodies), fell down like fallen mountains. Assailed by foot-soldiers, many<br>elephants and cars, destroyed or in course of destruction, fell down on<br>all sides. Horsemen, encountering foot-soldiers with activity, were slain<br>by the latter. Similarly crowds of foot-soldiers, slain by horsemen, laid<br>themselves down on the field. The faces and the limbs of those slain in<br>that dreadful battle looked like crushed lotuses and faded floral<br>wreaths. The beautiful forms of elephants and steeds and human beings, O<br>king, then resembled cloths foul with dirt, and became exceedingly<br>repulsive to look at.'"
