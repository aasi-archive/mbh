                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then Duryodhana, O chief of Bharatas, repairing to Karna,<br>said unto him as also unto the ruler of the Madras and the other lords of<br>Earth present there, these words, "Without seeking hath this occasion<br>arrived, when the gates of heaven have become wide open. Happy are those<br>Kshatriyas, O Karna, that obtain such a battle. Brave heroes fighting in<br>battle with brave Kshatriyas equal to them in might and prowess, obtain<br>great good, O son of Radha. The occasion that hath come is even such.<br>Either let these brave Kshatriyas, slaying the Pandavas in battle, obtain<br>the broad Earth, or let them, slain in battle by the foe, win the blessed<br>region reserved for heroes." Hearing these words of Duryodhana, those<br>bulls among Kshatriyas cheerfully uttered loud shouts and beat and blew<br>their musical instruments. When Duryodhana's force became thus filled<br>with joy, the son of Drona, gladdening all thy warriors further said, "In<br>the very sight of all the troops, and before the eyes of you all, my<br>father after he had laid aside his weapons, was slain by Dhrishtadyumna.<br>By that wrath which such an act might kindle, and for the sake also of my<br>friend, ye kings, I swear truly before you all. Listen then to that oath<br>of mine. Without slaying Dhrishtadyumna I shall not doff my armour. If<br>this vow of mine be not fulfilled, let me not go to heaven. Be it Arjuna,<br>be it Bhimasena, or be it anybody else, whoever will come against me I<br>will crush him or all of them. There is no doubt in this." After<br>Ashvatthama had uttered these words, the entire Bharata army, united<br>together, rushed against the Pandavas, and the latter also rushed against<br>the former. The collision of brave leaders of car-divisions, O Bharata,<br>became exceedingly awful. A destruction of life then set in at the van of<br>the Kurus and the Srinjayas, that resembled what takes place at the last<br>great universal dissolution. Upon the commencement of that<br>passage-at-arms, various (superior) beings, with the gods, came there<br>accompanied by the Apsaras, for beholding those foremost of men. Filled<br>with joy, the Apsaras began to cover those foremost of men devoted to the<br>duties of their order, with celestial garlands, with diverse kinds of<br>celestial perfumes, and with diverse species of gems. Soft winds bore<br>those excellent odours to the nostrils of all the foremost of warriors.<br>Having smelt those perfumes in consequence of the action of the wind, the<br>warriors once more engaged in battle, and striking one another began to<br>fall down on the Earth. Strewn with celestial flowers, with beautiful<br>shafts equipped with wings of gold, and with many foremost of warriors,<br>the Earth looked beautiful like the firmament bespangled with myriads of<br>stars. Then in consequence of cheers coming from the welkin and the noise<br>of musical instruments, the furious passage-at-arms distinguished by<br>twang of bows and clatter of car-wheels and shouts of warriors became<br>exceedingly fierce.'"
