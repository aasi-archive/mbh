                            "Sanjaya said, 'The high-souled son of Adhiratha, having listened<br>unconvinced to these words of the ruler of the Madras, addressed Shalya,<br>saying, "That which Vasudeva and Arjuna are is well-known to me. The<br>skill of Saurin in the management of cars, and the might and the high<br>weapons of Arjuna, the son of Pandu are well known to me at this hour.<br>Thou however, O Shalya, hast no ocular proof of those matters. I shall<br>fearlessly fight with the two Krishnas, those two foremost of all<br>wielders of weapons. The curse, however, of Rama that best of regenerate<br>persons, paineth me greatly today. I dwelt, in the disguise of a<br>brahmana, with Rama in former days, desirous of obtaining celestial<br>weapons from him. On that occasion, O Shalya, the chief of the gods,<br>wishing to benefit Phalguna, caused an obstacle, by approaching my thigh<br>and piercing it, having assumed the dire form of a worm. When my<br>preceptor slept, having laid his head thereon, that worm, approaching my<br>thigh, began to pierce it through. In consequence of the piercing of my<br>thigh, a pool of thick blood flowed from my body. For fear of (disturbing<br>the slumber of) my preceptor I did not move my limb. Awaking, the<br>brahmana, however, beheld what had taken place. Witnessing my patience he<br>addressed me, saying, 'Thou art never a brahmana. Tell me truly who thou<br>art.' I then, O Shalya, truly informed him of myself, saying that I was a<br>Suta. Hearing my words, the great ascetic, his heart filled with rage,<br>cursed me, saying, 'In consequence of the deception, O Suta, by which<br>thou hast obtained this weapon, it will never, at the time of need, when<br>the hour of thy death comes, occur to thy memory. Brahma cannot certainly<br>reside in one that is not a brahmana.' I have forgotten that great weapon<br>in this fierce and terrible battle. He amongst the Bharatas, O Shalya,<br>who is accomplished, who is an effectual smiter, who is universal<br>destroyer, and who is exceedingly terrible, (viz., Arjuna),&#8212;that mighty<br>crusher,&#8212;I think, will burn many foremost of kshatriyas. Know, however,<br>O Shalya, that I will slay in battle that fierce bowman, that foremost of<br>warriors, that hero endued with activity, that terrible person whose<br>energy is unbearable, that warrior whose promises are accomplished, that<br>son of Pandu, viz., Dhananjaya. I have that weapon (at least) under my<br>control today with which I will be able to destroy large numbers of foes.<br>I will slay in battle that scorcher of enemies, that mighty warrior<br>accomplished in weapons, that fierce bowman of immeasurable energy, that<br>cruel and terrible hero, that great resister of enemies, viz.,<br>Dhananjaya. The immeasurable Ocean, that lord of all waters, rusheth with<br>fierce impetuosity for overwhelming innumerable creatures. The continent,<br>however, holds and checks him. Today, in this world, I will resist in<br>fight the son of Kunti, that foremost of all drawers of the bow-string,<br>while he will be engaged in ceaselessly shooting his countless shafts<br>equipped with goodly wings, destructive of heroes, capable of penetrating<br>into every limb and none of which becomes futile. Like the continent<br>resisting the Ocean, I will today resist that mightiest of the mighty,<br>that great warrior possessing the highest weapons, that hero like unto<br>the Ocean's self of far-reaching arrows, fierce, and having shafts for<br>his waves, while he will be engaged in overwhelming (hostile) kings.<br>Behold today the fierce battle I fight with him that hath no equal, I<br>think, among men wielding the bow, and that would vanquish the very gods<br>united with the Asuras. Exceedingly proud is that son of Pandu. Desirous<br>of battle he will approach me with his mighty and super-human weapons.<br>Baffling his weapons with my own weapons in battle, I shall today<br>overthrow that Partha with my own excellent shafts. Scorching his foes<br>like the Sun endued with fiery rays, and blazing with flame like that<br>dispeller of the darkness, I shall, like a mass of clouds, completely<br>shroud Dhananjaya today with my shafts. Like the clouds extinguishing a<br>blazing fire of great energy and smoke-mixed flames, that seems ready to<br>consume the whole Earth, I shall, with my showers of arrows, extinguish<br>the son of Kunti in battle. With my broad-headed shafts I shall still the<br>son of Kunti, that terrible snake of virulent poison, that is exceedingly<br>difficult of being captured, that is endued with keen fangs, that is even<br>like a blazing fire that flames up in wrath, and that always consumes his<br>foes. Like Himavat bearing the mighty, all-crushing, fierce and smiting<br>god of wind, I shall, without moving, bear the angry and vindictive<br>Dhananjaya. I shall resist in battle Dhananjaya, that foremost of all<br>wielders of bows in the world, that hero in fight, that warrior who is<br>always in the van and who is competent to meet all foes, that car-warrior<br>who is conversant with all car-tracks. Today I shall fight in battle with<br>that person who hath, I think, no equal among men wielding the bow and<br>who conquered the entire Earth. What other man desirous of saving his<br>life, except myself, will fight with that Savyasaci, who vanquished all<br>creatures including the very gods in the country called Khandava? Arjuna<br>is proud; his weapons strike deep; he is endued with great lightness of<br>hands; he is conversant with steeds; he agitates vast hosts; he is<br>regarded an Atiratha. Though such, I shall yet, with my sharp shafts,<br>strike his head from off his trunk today. O Shalya, ever keeping Death or<br>victory in battle before me, I shall today fight with Dhananjaya. There<br>is none else save myself that would on a single car fight with that<br>Pandava who resembles the destroyer himself. I myself will gladly speak<br>of the prowess of Phalguna in the midst of an assembly of kshatriyas. Why<br>however, dost thou, a fool as thou art and of foolish understanding,<br>speak to me of Phalguna's prowess? Thou art a doer of disagreeable deeds.<br>Thou art cruel and mean and being thyself unforgiving, thou art a<br>detractor of one that is forgiving. I can slay a hundred persons like<br>thee, but I forgive thee in consequence of my forgiving disposition,<br>owing to the exigency of the times. Thou art of sinful deeds. Like a fool<br>thou hast, for the sake of Pandu's son, rebuked me and told me many<br>disagreeable things. Crooked-hearted as thou art, thou hast said all<br>these words unto me, that am of a sincere heart. Cursed art thou for thou<br>art an injurer of friends,&#8212;of friends, because friendship is<br>seven-paced. Terrible is the hour that is now passing. Duryodhana hath<br>himself come to battle. I am solicitous of seeing his purposes achieved.<br>Thou, however, art acting in such a way that it shows thee to have no<br>friendship (for the Kuru king)! He is a friend who shows affection for<br>another, who gladdens another, who makes himself agreeable to another,<br>who protects another, who honours another, and who rejoices in the joys<br>of another. I tell thee that I have all those attributes, and the king<br>himself knows all this. He, on the other hand, that destroys, chastises,<br>sharpens his weapons, injures, causes us to sigh, makes us cheerless, and<br>wrongs us in diverse ways, is a foe. All these attributes are to be found<br>in thee and thou discoverest all of them in me. For the sake of<br>Duryodhana, for the sake of doing what is agreeable to thee, for the sake<br>of victory, for the sake of myself, and for the sake of God himself, I<br>will with vigorous exertion, fight with Partha and Vasudeva. Witness<br>today my feats. Behold today my excellent weapons, my brahmastra and<br>other celestial weapons, as also those that are human. I will today slay<br>that hero of fierce prowess, like an exceedingly infuriate elephant<br>slaying an infuriate compeer. I shall, by my mind alone, hurl today at<br>Partha, for my victory, that weapon of immeasurable energy, called the<br>brahmastra. Arjuna will never be able to escape that weapon, if only the<br>wheels of my car do not sink into the Earth in battle today. Know this, O<br>Shalya, that I would not take fright at Yama himself armed with his rod,<br>or Varuna himself armed with his noose, or Kuvera himself armed with his<br>mace, or Vasava himself armed with the thunderbolt, or at any other foe<br>whatever that may approach for slaying me. Therefore, I have no fear from<br>Partha, nor from Janardana. On the other hand, I shall encounter them<br>both in today's destructive battle. Once on a time, while wandering for<br>the sake of practising weapons on my bow called Vijaya, O king, I had, by<br>shooting many fierce shafts of terrible forms, heedlessly struck the calf<br>of a (brahmana's) homa cow with one of those shafts, and unwillingly<br>killed it white it was wandering in a solitary forest. The brahmana then<br>addressed me, saying, 'Since, becoming insensate, thou hast slain the<br>offspring of my homa cow, the wheel (of thy car) will sink into the Earth<br>while at the time of battle fear will enter thy heart.' From these words<br>of the brahmana I am experiencing great fear. These kings of the Lunar<br>race that are lords of (other people's) weal and woe, offered to give<br>that brahmana a 1,000 kine and 600 bovine bulls. With even such a gift, O<br>Shalya, the brahmana would not be gratified, O ruler of the Madras. I was<br>then for giving him seven hundred elephants of large tusks and many<br>hundred of slaves male and female. That foremost of brahmana would not<br>still be gratified. Collecting next full 14,000 kine, each black in hue<br>and having a white calf I was still unable to obtain the grace of that<br>best of brahmana. A wealthy mansion full of every object of desire, in<br>fact, whatever wealth I had, I wished to give him with due worship, but<br>he refused to accept the gift. Unto me then that had offended and that<br>had begged so importunately for his pardon, the brahmana said, 'That<br>which, O Suta, hath been uttered by me is sure to happen. It cannot be<br>otherwise. A false speech would destroy creatures, and sin also would be<br>mine. Therefore, for the preservation of virtue I do not venture to speak<br>what is false. Do not, again, destroy the means of a brahmana's support.<br>There is none in the world that would be able to falsify my speech.<br>Accept those words. It will be thy atonement (for the sin of having slain<br>a calf).' Though rebuked by thee, still for friendship's sake, I have<br>disclosed to thee all this. I know thee that art rebuking me thus. Be<br>silent now, and hear what I will presently say.'"
