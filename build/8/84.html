                            "Sanjaya said, 'After the slaughter of Duhshasana, O king, ten of thy<br>sons, heroes that never retreated from battle, all of whom were great<br>car-warriors, endued with mighty energy, and filled with the poison of<br>wrath, shrouded Bhima with their shafts. Nishangin, and Kavachin, and<br>Pasin and Dundadhara and Dhanurgraha, and Alolupa, and Saha, and Shanda,<br>and Vatavega and Suvarchasas, these ten, afflicted at the slaughter of<br>their brother, united together and checked the mighty-armed Bhimasena<br>with their shafts. Resisted on all sides with their shafts by those great<br>car-warriors, Bhima, with eyes red as fire with fury, looked resplendent<br>like the Destroyer himself in rage. Partha, however, with ten<br>broad-headed shafts of great impetuosity, equipped with golden wings,<br>despatched to Yama's abode those ten Bharata princes decked with golden<br>bracelets. Upon the fall of those ten heroes, thy army fled away in the<br>very sight of the Suta's son, overwhelmed with the fear of the Pandavas.<br>Then, O king, great fear entered the heart of Karna at sight of Bhima's<br>prowess which resembled that of the Destroyer himself unto living<br>creatures. Then Shalya, that ornament of assemblies, understanding the<br>state of Karna's mind from a survey of his features, addressed that<br>chastiser of foes in words suited to the hour, "Do not be grieved, O son<br>of Radha! This deed does not become thee. Afflicted with the fear of<br>Bhimasena, these kings are all flying away. Exceedingly pained by the<br>calamity that has befallen his brother Duhshasana in consequence of his<br>blood having been quaffed by the high-souled Bhima, Duryodhana is<br>stupefied! Kripa and others, and those of the king's brothers that are<br>still alive, with afflicted hearts, their rage quelled by sorrow, are<br>tending Duryodhana, sitting around him. Those heroes, the Pandavas of<br>sure aim, headed by Dhananjaya, are advancing against thee for battle.<br>For these reasons, O tiger among men, mustering all thy prowess and<br>keeping the duties of a Kshatriya before thy eyes, proceed against<br>Dhananjaya. The entire burthen (of this battle) has been placed upon thee<br>by the son of Dhritarashtra. O thou of mighty arms, bear that burthen to<br>the best of thy power and might. In victory there will be great fame. In<br>defeat, heaven is certain. There, O son of Radha, thy son, Vrishasena,<br>filled with wrath at sight of the stupefaction that has overwhelmed thee,<br>is rushing towards the Pandavas." Hearing these words of Shalya of<br>immeasurable energy, Karna, reflecting, concluded unalterably that<br>fighting had become unavoidable. Then Vrishasena, filled with wrath, and<br>riding upon his own car, rushed towards that son of Pandu, viz.,<br>Vrikodara, who, armed with his mace, resembled the Destroyer himself with<br>his fatal rod and was employed in slaughtering thy troops. That foremost<br>of heroes, Nakula, filled with wrath, rushed at that enemy of theirs,<br>Karna's son, striking him with arrows, like the victorious Maghavat with<br>joyous heart rushing against (the Asura) Jambha. Then the brave Nakula,<br>with a razor-headed shaft, cut off his enemy's standard decked with gems.<br>With a broad-headed arrow, he next cut off the bow also of Karna's son,<br>with a golden belt attached to it. Possessed of mighty weapons, Karna's<br>son then, desirous of showing his regard for Duhshasana, quickly took up<br>another bow, and pierced Nakula, the son of Pandu with many mighty<br>celestial weapons. The high-souled Nakula, then, filled with rage,<br>pierced his antagonist with shafts that resembled large blazing brands.<br>At this Karna's son also, accomplished in weapons, showered celestial<br>weapon upon Nakula. From rage engendered by the strokes of his enemy's<br>weapon, as also from his own resplendence and the energy of his weapons,<br>the son of Karna blazed up like a fire with libations of clarified<br>butter. Indeed, O king, Karna's son then slew with his excellent weapons<br>the beautiful steeds of the delicate Nakula, that were of the Vanayu<br>breed, white in hue, and decked with trappings of gold. Alighting then<br>from his steedless vehicle, and taking up a bright shield decked with<br>golden moons, and armed also with a sword that was blue as the sky,<br>Nakula, frequently jumping up, careered there like a bird. Performing<br>diverse beautiful evolutions in the air, the son of Pandu cut off many<br>foremost of men and steeds and elephants. Cut off with that sword, they<br>fell down on the earth like animals cut off in a horse-sacrifice by the<br>person appointed to that duty. 2,000 well-trained heroes, delighting in<br>battle, hailing from diverse realms, well-paid, of sure aim, and their<br>limbs smeared with excellent sandal-paste, were quickly cut off by the<br>single-handed Nakula inspired with desire of victory. Then Karna's son,<br>suddenly advancing with great speed against the rushing Nakula in that<br>battle pierced him from every side with many keen arrows from desire of<br>slaying him. Thus struck with shafts (by Vrishasena), Nakula struck his<br>brave antagonist in return. Pierced by the son of Pandu, Vrishasena<br>became filled with wrath. Protected, however, in that dreadful battle, by<br>his brother Bhima, the high-souled Nakula achieved such terrible feats on<br>that occasion. Filled with rage, the son of Karna then pierced with<br>eighteen shafts the heroic Nakula who seemed to sport in that battle,<br>while employed, unaided, in destroying the foremost of men and steeds and<br>elephants. Deeply pierced by Vrishasena in that battle, O king, Pandu's<br>son Nakula, that foremost of men, endued with great activity, became<br>filled with rage and rushed in that encounter against the son of Karna<br>from desire of slaying him. Then Vrishasena poured showers of keen shafts<br>upon Nakula of great energy as the latter precipitately advanced against<br>him in that battle like a hawk with outstretched wings from desire of<br>meat. Baffling, however, his antagonist's showers of shafts, Nakula<br>careered in diverse beautiful motions. Then Karna's son, O king, in that<br>dreadful battle, cut off, with his mighty shafts, the shield, decked with<br>a 1,000 stars, of Nakula, while he was careering with great activity in<br>those beautiful motions. Without losing a moment, that resister of foes,<br>(Vrishasena), with half a dozen sharp razor-headed shafts, then cut off<br>that naked sword of Nakula, polished and keen-edged, made of steel,<br>capable of bearing a great strain and of destroying the bodies of all<br>foes, and terrible and fierce as the poison of the snake, while he was<br>whirling it rapidly. After this, Vrishasena deeply pierced his antagonist<br>in the centre of his chest with some well-tempered and keen shafts.<br>Having achieved those feats in battle that were applauded by all noble<br>persons and that could not be achieved by other men, the high-souled<br>Nakula of great activity, afflicted with those shafts, proceeded to the<br>car, O king, of Bhimasena. The steedless son of Madri, thus afflicted by<br>Karna's son, sprang upon Bhima's car like a lion springing upon a<br>mountain summit, in the sight of Dhananjaya. The high-souled and heroic<br>Vrishasena then, filled with wrath, poured his arrowy showers upon those<br>two mighty car-warriors for piercing those two sons of Pandu. After the<br>destruction of that car belonging to the son of Pandu (Nakula), and after<br>his sword also had been speedily cut off with (Vrishasena's) shafts; many<br>other foremost of Kuru heroes, uniting together, approached the Pandava<br>brothers, and began to strike them with showers of shafts. Then those two<br>sons of Pandu, Bhima and Arjuna, filled with wrath, and resembling two<br>fires fed with libations of clarified butter, poured terrible showers of<br>arrows upon Vrishasena and the other assembled warriors around him. The<br>son of the Wind-god then, addressing Phalguna, said, "Behold, Nakula here<br>is being afflicted. The son of Karna is resisting us. Proceed, therefore,<br>against Karna's son." Hearing these words, the diadem-decked (Arjuna)<br>approached the car of his brother Vrikodara. Beholding that hero arrived<br>near, Nakula addressed him, saying, "Do thou speedily slay this one."<br>Thus addressed in that battle by his brother, Nakula, standing before<br>him, the diadem-decked Arjuna, that formidable hero, precipitately caused<br>his ape-bannered vehicle, guided by Keshava himself, to be driven towards<br>Vrishasena.'"
