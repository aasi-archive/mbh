                            Om! Having bowed down unto Narayana, and unto that most exalted of male<br>beings, Nara, and unto the goddess Sarasvati also, must the word Jaya be<br>uttered.<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "After Drona had been slain, O monarch, the royal<br>warriors (of the Kaurava army) headed by Duryodhana, with hearts filled<br>with great anxiety, all repaired to Drona's son. Lamenting the loss of<br>Drona, and deprived of energy in consequence of their cheerlessness, they<br>sat around the son of Sharadvata's daughter, afflicted with grief.<br>Comforted for a little while by considerations founded upon the<br>scriptures, when night came, those rulers of Earth proceeded to their<br>respective tents. Those lords of Earth, however, O thou of Kuru's race,<br>could feel no happiness in their abodes. Thinking of that immense<br>slaughter, they could not also sleep. The Suta's son (Karna), and king<br>Suyodhana and Duhshasana and Shakuni, in special, could not compose<br>themselves to sleep. Those four passed that night together in<br>Duryodhana's tent, reflecting upon the woes they had inflicted upon the<br>high-souled Pandavas. Formerly they had brought Draupadi, plunged into<br>woe on account of the match at dice, into the assembly. Recollecting it<br>they experienced great regret, their hearts being filled with anxiety.<br>Thinking of those sufferings inflicted (upon the Pandavas) in consequence<br>of the gambling match they passed that night in sorrow, O king, as if it<br>were really a hundred years. Then when morning came, observing the<br>dictates of the ordinance, all of them duly went through the customary<br>rites. Having gone through these customary rites, and comforted to some<br>extent, O Bharata, they ordered their troops to be arrayed, and then came<br>out for battle, having made Karna their generalissimo by tying the<br>auspicious thread round his wrists, and having caused many foremost of<br>brahmanas, by presents of vessels of curds, clarified butter, akshatas,<br>coins of gold, kine, jewels and gems, and costly robes, to pray for their<br>victory, and having caused heralds and musicians, and panegyrists to<br>adore them with hymns about victory. The Pandavas also, O king, having<br>gone through their morning rites, issued from their camp, resolved on<br>battle. Then commenced a fierce battle, making the hair to stand on end,<br>between the Kurus and the Pandavas, each desirous of vanquishing the<br>other. During the commandership of Karna, the battle that took place<br>between the Kuru and the Pandava troops was exceedingly fierce and lasted<br>for two days. Then Vrisha (Karna) having made an immense slaughter of his<br>enemies in battle, was at last slain in the sight of the Dhartarashtras,<br>by Arjuna. Then Sanjaya, repairing to Hastinapura told Dhritarashtra all<br>that had happened at Kurujangala."<br><br>Janamejaya said, "Having heard of the fall of Bhishma and that other<br>mighty car-warrior, Drona, the old king Dhritarashtra the son of Ambika<br>had been afflicted with great grief. How, O foremost of brahmanas, could<br>he, plunged into grief, support his life having heard of the death of<br>Karna, that well-wisher of Duryodhana? How indeed, could that descendant<br>of Kuru support his life when he, upon whom that monarch had rested the<br>hope of his sons' victory, had fallen? When the king did not lay down his<br>life even after hearing of Karna's death, I think that it is very<br>difficult for men to yield up life even under circumstances of great<br>grief! O brahmana, when the king did not yield up his life after hearing<br>of the fall of the venerable son of Shantanu, of Bahlika and Drona and<br>Somadatta and Bhurishrava, as also other friends and his sons and<br>grandsons, I think, O regenerate one, that the act of yielding up one's<br>life is exceedingly difficult! Tell me all these in detail and as they<br>actually happened! I am not satiated with hearing the high achievements<br>of my ancestors!"
