                            "Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile ninety Kaurava car-warriors rushed for battle<br>against the ape-bannered Arjuna who was advancing, borne by his steeds of<br>exceeding fleetness. Those tigers among men, having sworn a terrible oath<br>about the other world, encompassed that tiger among men, Arjuna. Krishna,<br>however, (without minding those warriors), urged the white steeds of<br>Arjuna, endued with great speed and adorned with ornaments of gold and<br>covered with networks of pearls, towards Karna's car. Those ninety<br>Samsaptaka cars pursued Dhananjaya, that slayer of foes, pouring upon him<br>showers of shafts, as he proceeded towards Karna's car. Then Arjuna, with<br>his keen shafts, cut off those ninety assailants endued with great<br>activity, along with their drivers and bows and standards. Slain by the<br>diadem-decked Arjuna with diverse kinds of shafts, they fell down like<br>Siddhas falling down, with their cars, from heaven upon the exhaustion of<br>their merits. After this, many Kauravas, with cars and elephants and<br>steeds, fearlessly advanced against that foremost one of Kuru's race,<br>that chief of the Bharatas, Phalguna. That large force of thy sons,<br>teeming with struggling men and steeds, and swelling with foremost of<br>elephants, then encompassed Dhananjaya, checking his further progress.<br>The mighty Kaurava bowmen shrouded that descendant of Kuru's race with<br>darts and swords and lances and spears and maces and scimitars and<br>arrows. Like the Sun destroying the darkness with his rays, the son of<br>Pandu destroyed with his own shafts that shower of weapons over-spread in<br>the welkin. Then a force of Mlecchas riding thirteen hundred<br>ever-infuriated elephants, at the command of thy son, assailed Partha in<br>the flank. With barbed arrows and Nalikas and cloth-yard shafts and<br>lances and spears and darts and Kampanas and short arrows, they afflicted<br>Partha on his car. That matchless shower of weapons, some of which were<br>hurled by the elephants with their tusks, Phalguna cut off with his<br>broad-headed shafts and crescent-shaped arrows of great keenness. With<br>excellent arrows of diverse kinds, he struck all those elephants and<br>their standards and banners and riders, like Indra striking mountains<br>with thunderbolts. Afflicted with gold-winged shafts, those huge<br>elephants decked with necklaces of gold fell down deprived of life, like<br>mountains ablaze with volcanic fires. Amid that roaring and shouting and<br>wailing army of men and elephants and steeds, the twang of Gandiva, O<br>monarch, rose high. Elephants, O king, struck (with shafts), fled away on<br>all sides. Steeds also, their riders slain, wandered in all directions.<br>Cars, O monarch, looking like the changeful forms of vapour in the sky,<br>deprived of riders and steeds, were seen in thousands. Horsemen, O<br>monarch, wandering hither and thither, were seen to fall down deprived of<br>life by the shafts of Partha. At that time the might of Arjuna's arms was<br>seen. (So great was that might) that alone, in that battle, he vanquished<br>horsemen and elephants and car-warriors (that had been assailing him from<br>every side). Then Bhimasena, beholding the diadem-decked Phalguna<br>encompassed, O bull of Bharata's race, by a large (Kaurava) host<br>consisting of three kinds of forces, abandoned the small unslaughtered<br>remnant of the Kaurava car-warriors with whom he had been engaged, and<br>rushed impetuously, O king, to the spot where Dhananjaya's car was.<br>Meanwhile the Kaurava force that still remained after heavy slaughter,<br>exceedingly weakened, fled away, Bhima (as already said) beholding<br>Arjuna, proceeded towards his brother. The unfatigued Bhima, armed with a<br>mace, destroyed, in that battle, the portion that still remained after<br>the greater part had been slaughtered by Arjuna, of the Kaurava host<br>possessed of great might. Fierce as the death-night, subsisting upon men<br>and elephants and steeds as its food, and capable of crushing walls and<br>mansions and gates of cities, that exceedingly terrible mace of Bhima<br>incessantly descended on men and elephants and steeds around him. That<br>mace, O sire, slew numberless steeds and riders. With that mace the son<br>of Pandu crushed men and steeds cased in steel armour. Struck therewith,<br>they fell down with great noise. Biting the earth with their teeth, and<br>bathed in blood, these, with the crowns of their heads and bows and lower<br>limbs crushed, laid themselves down on the field, supplying all<br>carnivorous creatures with food. Satiated with blood and flesh and<br>marrow, and eating bones as well, that mace (of Bhimasena) became, like<br>the death-night, difficult of being gazed at. Having slain 10,000 horses<br>and numerous foot-soldiers, Bhima ran hither and thither in rage, armed<br>with his mace. Then, O Bharata, thy troops, beholding Bhima mace in hand,<br>thought that Yama himself, armed with his fatal bludgeon, was in their<br>midst. The son of Pandu then, excited with rage, and resembling an<br>infuriated elephant, penetrated into the elephant division (of the<br>Kauravas), like a Makara entering the ocean. Having, with his formidable<br>mace, penetrated into that elephant division, the enraged Bhima, within a<br>very short time, despatched it to Yama's abode. We then beheld those<br>infuriated elephants with spiked plates on their bodies falling on every<br>side, with their riders and standards, like winged mountains. Having<br>destroyed that elephant division, the mighty Bhimasena, once more riding<br>on his car, followed Arjuna at his rear. That great host, thus<br>slaughtered, filled with cheerlessness and about to fly away, stood<br>almost inactive, O monarch, assailed on all sides with weapons. Beholding<br>that host looking humble and standing inactive and almost motionless,<br>Arjuna covered it with life-scorching shafts. Men and steeds and<br>elephants, pierced in that battle with showers of shafts by the wielder<br>of Gandiva, looked beautiful like Kadamva flowers with their filaments.<br>Thus struck with Arjuna's shafts that quickly slew men and steeds and<br>cars and elephants, loud wails, O king, arose from the Kuru army. With<br>cries of "Oh" and "Alas," and exceedingly frightened, and huddling close<br>to one another, thy army began to turn round with great speed. The<br>battle, however, continued between the Kurus and the Pandavas of great<br>might. There was not a single car-warrior or horseman or elephant-warrior<br>or steed or elephant that was unwounded. Their coats of mail pierced with<br>shafts and themselves bathed in blood, the troops looked blazing like a<br>forest of flowering Asokas. Beholding Savyasaci putting forth his valour<br>on that occasion, the Kauravas became hopeless of Karna's life. Regarding<br>the touch of Arjuna's shafts to be unbearable, the Kauravas, vanquished<br>by the wielder of Gandiva, fled from the field. Deserting Karna in that<br>battle as they were being thus struck with Arjuna's shafts, they fled<br>away in fear on all sides, loudly calling upon the Suta's son (to rescue<br>them). Partha, however, pursued them, shooting hundreds of shafts and<br>gladdening the Pandava warriors headed by Bhimasena. Thy sons then, O<br>monarch, proceeded towards the car of Karna. Sinking, as they seemed to<br>be, in a fathomless ocean, Karna then became an island unto them. The<br>Kauravas, O monarch, like snakes without poison, took Karna's shelter,<br>moved by the fear of the wielder of Gandiva. Indeed, even as creatures, O<br>sire, endued with actions, from fear of death, take the shelter of<br>virtue, thy sons, O ruler of men, from fear of the high-souled son of<br>Pandu, took shelter with the mighty bowman Karna. Then, Karna, uninspired<br>with fear, addressed those distressed warriors afflicted with arrows and<br>bathed in blood, saying, 'Do not fear! Come to me!" Beholding thy army<br>vigorously broken by Partha, Karna, stretching his bow, stood desirous of<br>slaughtering the foe. Seeing that the Kurus had left the field, Karna,<br>that foremost of all wielders of weapons, reflecting a little, set his<br>heart upon the slaughter of Partha and began to draw deep breaths.<br>Bending his formidable bow, Adhiratha's son Vrisha once more rushed<br>against the Pancalas, in the very sight of Savyasaci. Soon, however, many<br>lords of the earth, with eyes red as blood, poured their arrowy downpours<br>on him like clouds pouring rain upon a mountain. Then thousands of<br>arrows, O foremost of living creatures, shot by Karna, O sire, deprived<br>many Pancalas of their lives. Loud sounds of wailing were uttered by the<br>Pancalas, O thou of great intelligence, while they were being thus<br>smitten by the Suta's son, that rescuer of friends, for the sake of his<br>friends.'"
