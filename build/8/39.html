                            "'Shalya said, "Do not, O Suta's son, give away to any man a golden car<br>with six bulls of elephantine proportions. Thou wilt obtain a sight of<br>Dhananjaya today. From foolishness thou art giving away wealth as if thou<br>wert the Lord of treasures. Without any trouble, however, O son of Radha,<br>thou wilt behold Dhananjaya today. Thou art for giving away this wealth<br>like a senseless person; but thou seest not the demerits attaching to<br>those gifts that are made to undeserving persons. With that large wealth<br>which thou art desirous of giving away, thou art certainly able to<br>perform many sacrifices. Therefore, O Suta's son, do thou perform those<br>sacrifices. As regards thy desire, entertained from folly, that is surely<br>vain. We have never heard of a couple of lions having been overthrown by<br>a fox. Thou seekest what should never be sought by thee. It seems that<br>thou hast no friends for forbidding thee that art speedily falling into a<br>blazing fire. Thou art unable to discriminate between what thou shouldst<br>do and what thou shouldst not. Without doubt thy period is full. What man<br>desirous of living would utter speeches that are so incoherent and<br>undeserving of being listened to? This thy endeavour is like that of a<br>person desirous of crossing the ocean by the aid of only his two arms<br>after having attached to his neck a heavy stone, or of one desirous of<br>leaping down from the summit of a mountain. If thou art desirous of<br>winning what is for thy good, fight with Dhananjaya, well protected from<br>within thy arrayed division, and aided by all thy warriors. I say this to<br>thee for the good of Dhritarashtra's son and not from any ill will to<br>thee. If thou hast any wish for preserving thy life then accept the words<br>spoken by me."<br><br>"'Karna said, "Relying on the might of my own arms I seek Arjuna in<br>battle. Thou, however, that art a foe with the face of a friend desirest<br>to frighten me. No person shall deter me from this resolution, not even<br>Indra himself uplifting his thunder; what then need be said of a mortal?'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'At the conclusion of these words of Karna, Shalya,<br>the ruler of the Madras, desirous of provoking Karna exceedingly, said<br>these words in reply, "When keen-pointed shafts winged with Kanka<br>feathers, shot by Phalguna of mighty arms and impelled from his<br>bow-string and sped with all his energy will seek thee then wilt thou<br>lament thy encounter with that hero. When Partha, called also Savyasaci,<br>taking up his celestial bow, will scorch the (Kuru) army and afflict thee<br>exceedingly with keen shafts, then, O Suta's son, wilt thou repent (of<br>thy folly). As a child lying on the lap of its mother seeks to seize the<br>Moon, even so dost thou from folly seek to vanquish the resplendent<br>Arjuna stationed on his car. In desiring, O Karna, to fight today with<br>Arjuna of keen-edged feats, thou art for rubbing all thy limbs against<br>the keen edges of a trident. This thy challenge of Arjuna, O Suta's son,<br>is like that of a foolish young little deer of activity challenging a<br>huge lion excited with wrath. Do not, O Suta's son, challenge that prince<br>of mighty energy like a fox gratified with meat in the forest challenging<br>the maned monarch of the forest. Do not be destroyed, encountering<br>Arjuna. Thou, O Karna, challengest Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, even<br>like a hare challenging a mighty elephant with tusks large as<br>plough-shafts, and with the juice issuing out of its mouth and rent<br>cheeks. From folly thou art piercing, with a piece of wood, the black<br>cobra of virulent poison excited to fury within its hole, in desiring to<br>fight with Partha. Endued with little understanding, thou, O Karna,<br>disregarding that lion among men, viz., the son of Pandu, yellest at him,<br>like a jackal that, disregarding a maned lion excited with wrath, yells<br>at him. As a snake, for its own destruction, challenges that foremost of<br>birds, viz., Vinata's son, possessed of beautiful plumage and great<br>activity, even so dost thou, O Karna, challenge Dhananjaya the son of<br>Pandu. Thou desirest to cross without a raft the terrible ocean, the<br>receptacle of all the waters, with its mountain waves and teeming with<br>aquatic animals, when at its height at the rise of the Moon. O Karna,<br>thou challengest Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, to battle even like a<br>calf challenging a smiting bull of keen horns and neck thick as a drum.<br>Like a frog croaking at a terrible and mighty cloud yielding copious<br>showers of rain, thou croakest at Arjuna who is even like Parjanya among<br>men. As a dog from within the precincts of the house of his master barks<br>at a forest-roaming tiger, even so, O Karna, thou barkest at Dhananjaya,<br>that tiger among men. A jackal, O Karna, residing in the forest in the<br>midst of hares regardeth himself a lion till he actually sees a lion.<br>Even so, O son of Radha, thou regardest thyself a lion, for thou dost not<br>behold that repressor of foes, that tiger among men, viz., Dhananjaya.<br>Thou regardest thyself a lion till thou beholdest the two Krishnas<br>stationed on the same car like Surya and Candramas. As long as thou dost<br>not hear the twang of Gandiva in great battle, so long art thou able to<br>do what thou pleasest. Beholding Partha, causing the ten points of the<br>compass to resound with the roar of his car and the twang of his bow, and<br>beholding him roaring like a tiger, thou wilt become a jackal. Thou art<br>always a jackal, and Dhananjaya always a lion. O fool, in consequence of<br>thy envy and hatred for heroes, thou always, seemest to be like a jackal.<br>As a mouse and a car are to each other in strength, or a dog and a tiger,<br>a fox and a lion, or a hare and an elephant, as falsehood and truth, as<br>poison and nectar, even so art thou and Partha known to all by your<br>respective deeds.'"
