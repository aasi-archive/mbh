                            "'Shalya said, "These, O Karna, are ravings that thou utterest regarding<br>the foe. As regards myself without a 1,000 Karnas I am able to vanquish<br>the foe in battle.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Unto the ruler of Madras, of harsh features, who was<br>saying such disagreeable things unto Karna, the latter once more said<br>words that were twice bitter.<br><br>"'Karna said, "Listen with devoted attention to this, O ruler of the<br>Madras, that was heard by me while it was recited in the presence of<br>Dhritarashtra. In Dhritarashtra's abode the brahmanas used to narrate the<br>accounts of diverse delightful regions and many kings of ancient times. A<br>foremost one among brahmanas, venerable in years while reciting old<br>histories, said these words, blaming the Vahikas and Madrakas, 'One<br>should always avoid the Vahikas, those impure people that are out of the<br>pale of virtue, and that live away from the Himavat and the Ganga and<br>Sarasvati and Yamuna and Kurukshetra and the Sindhu and its five<br>tributary rivers. I remember from the days of my youth that a<br>slaughter-ground for kine and a space for storing intoxicating spirits<br>always distinguish the entrances of the abodes of the (Vahika) kings. On<br>some very secret mission I had to live among the Vahikas. In consequence<br>of such residence the conduct of these people is well known to me. There<br>is a town of the name of Sakala, a river of the name of Apaga, and a clan<br>of the Vahikas known by the name of the Jarttikas. The practices of these<br>people are very censurable. They drink the liquor called Gauda, and eat<br>fried barley with it. They also eat beef with garlic. They also eat cakes<br>of flour mixed with meat, and boiled rice that is bought from others. Of<br>righteous practices they have none. Their women, intoxicated with drink<br>and divested of robes, laugh and dance outside the walls of the houses in<br>cities, without garlands and unguents, singing while drunk obscene songs<br>of diverse kinds that are as musical as the bray of the ass or the bleat<br>of the camel. In intercourse they are absolutely without any restraint,<br>and in all other matters they act as they like. Maddened with drink, they<br>call upon one another, using many endearing epithets. Addressing many<br>drunken exclamations to their husbands and lords, the fallen women among<br>the Vahikas, without observing restrictions even on sacred days, give<br>themselves up to dancing. One of those wicked Vahikas,&#8212;one that is, that<br>lived amongst those arrogant women,&#8212;who happened to live for some days<br>in Kurujangala, burst out with cheerless heart, saying, "Alas, that<br>(Vahika) maiden of large proportions, dressed in thin blankets, is<br>thinking of me,&#8212;her Vahika lover&#8212;that is now passing his days in<br>Kurujangala, at the hour of her going to bed." Crossing the Sutlej and<br>the delightful Iravati, and arriving at my own country, when shall I cast<br>my eyes upon those beautiful women with thick frontal bones, with blazing<br>circlets of red arsenic on their foreheads, with streaks of jet black<br>collyrium on their eyes, and their beautiful forms attired in blankets<br>and skins and themselves uttering shrill cries! When shall I be happy, in<br>the company of those intoxicated ladies amid the music of drums and<br>kettle-drums and conchs sweet as the cries of asses and camels and mules!<br>When shall I be amongst those ladies eating cakes of flour and meat and<br>balls of pounded barley mixed with skimmed milk, in the forests, having<br>many pleasant paths of Sami and Pilu and Karira! When shall I, amid my<br>own countrymen, mustering in strength on the high-roads, fall upon<br>passengers, and snatching their robes and attires beat them repeatedly!<br>What man is there that would willingly dwell, even for a moment amongst<br>the Vahikas that are so fallen and wicked, and so depraved in their<br>practises?' Even thus did that brahmana describe the Vahikas of base<br>behaviour, a sixth of whose merits and demerits is thine, O Shalya.<br>Having said this, that pious brahmana began once more to say what I am<br>about to repeat respecting the wicked Vahikas. Listen to what I say, 'In<br>the large and populous town of Sakala, a Rakshasa woman used to sing on<br>every fourteenth day of the dark fortnight, in accompaniment with a drum,<br>"When shall I next sing the songs of the Vahikas in this Sakala town,<br>having gorged myself with beef and drunk the Gauda liquor? When shall I<br>again, decked in ornaments, and with those maidens and ladies of large<br>proportions, gorge upon a large number of sheep and large quantities of<br>pork and beef and the meat of fowls and asses and camels? They who do not<br>eat sheep live in vain!"' Even thus, O Shalya, the young and old, among<br>the inhabitants of Sakala, intoxicated with spirits, sing and cry. How<br>can virtue be met with among such a people? Thou shouldst know this. I<br>must, however, speak again to thee about what another brahmana had said<br>unto us in the Kuru court, 'There where forests of Pilus stand, and those<br>five rivers flow, viz., the Satadru, the Vipasa, the Iravati, the<br>Candrabhaga, and the Vitasa and which have the Sindhu for their sixth,<br>there in those regions removed from the Himavat, are the countries called<br>by the name of the Arattas. Those regions are without virtue and<br>religion. No one should go thither. The gods, the pitris, and the<br>brahmanas, never accept gifts from those that are fallen, or those that<br>are begotten by Shudras on the girls of other castes, or the Vahikas who<br>never perform sacrifices and are exceedingly irreligious.' That learned<br>brahmana had also said in the Kuru court, 'The Vahikas, without any<br>feelings of revulsion, eat of wooden vessels having deep stomachs and<br>earthen plates and vessels that have been licked by dogs and that are<br>stained with pounded barley and other corn. The Vahikas drink the milk of<br>sheep and camels and asses and eat curds and other preparations from<br>those different kinds of milk. Those degraded people number many bastards<br>among them. There is no food and no milk that they do not take. The<br>Aratta-Vahikas that are steeped in ignorance, should be avoided.' Thou<br>shouldst know this, O Shalya. I must, however, again speak to thee about<br>what another brahmana had said unto me in the Kuru court, 'How can one go<br>to heaven, having drunk milk in the town called Yugandhara, and resided<br>in the place called Acyutasthala, and bathed in the spot called<br>Bhutilaya? There where the five rivers flow just after issuing from the<br>mountains, there among the Aratta-Vahikas, no respectable person should<br>dwell even for two days. There are two Pishacas named Vahi and Hika in<br>the river Vipasa. The Vahikas are the offspring of those two Pishacas.<br>They are not creatures created by the Creator. Being of such low origin,<br>how can they be conversant with the duties ordained in the scriptures?<br>The Karashakas, the Mahishakas, the Kalingas, the Keralas, the<br>Karkotakas, the Virakas, and other peoples of no religion, one should<br>always avoid.' Even thus did a Rakshasa woman of gigantic hips speak unto<br>a brahmana who on a certain occasion went to that country for bathing in<br>a sacred water and passed a single night there. The regions are called by<br>the name of Arattas. The people residing there are called the Vahikas.<br>The lowest of brahmanas also are residing there from very remote times.<br>They are without the Veda and without knowledge, without sacrifice and<br>without the power to assist at other's sacrifices. They are all fallen<br>and many amongst them have been begotten by Shudras upon other peoples'<br>girls. The gods never accept any gifts from them. The Prasthalas, the<br>Madras, the Gandharas, the Arattas, those called Khasas, the Vasatis, the<br>Sindhus and the Sauviras are almost as blamable in their practices.'"
