                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding then that unrivalled array of the Parthas made<br>by Dhrishtadyumna which was capable of resisting all hostile armies,<br>Karna proceeded, uttering leonine shouts and causing his car to produce a<br>loud rattle. And he made the Earth to tremble with the loud din of<br>musical instruments. And that chastiser of foes, that hero in battle,<br>seemed to tremble in rage. Duly disposing his own troops in<br>counter-array, O bull of Bharata's race, that hero of great energy made a<br>great slaughter of the Pandava forces like Maghavat slaughtering the<br>Asura host. Striking Yudhishthira then with many arrows, he placed the<br>eldest son of Pandu to his right.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'How, O Sanjaya, did the son of Radha dispose his<br>forces in counter array to all the Pandavas headed by Dhristadyumna and<br>protected by Bhimasena, viz., all those great bowmen invincible by the<br>very gods? Who, O Sanjaya, stood in the wings and the further wings of<br>our army? Dividing themselves properly, how were the warriors stationed?<br>How also did the sons of Pandu dispose their army in counter-array to<br>mine? How also did that great and awful battle commence? Where was<br>Vibhatsu when Karna proceeded against Yudhishthira? Who could succeed in<br>assailing Yudhishthira in the presence of Arjuna? That Arjuna who had<br>vanquished, single-handed in former days, all creatures at Khandava, who<br>else that is desirous of life, save the son of Radha, would fight with<br>him?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Hear now of the formation of the arrays, the manner in<br>which Arjuna came and how the battle was fought by both sides surrounding<br>their respective kings. Sharadvata's son Kripa, O king, and the Magadhas<br>endued with great activity, and Kritavarma of Satwata race, took up their<br>position in the right wing. Shakuni, and the mighty car-warrior Uluka,<br>standing on the right of these, and accompanied by many fearless Gandhara<br>horsemen armed with bright lances, and many mountaineers difficult to<br>defeat, numerous as flights of locusts, and grimlooking as Pishacas,<br>protected the (Kaurava) army. 34,000 unreturning cars of the samsaptakas,<br>mad with desire of battle, with thy sons in their midst, and all desirous<br>of slaying Krishna and Arjuna, protected the left side (of the Kaurava<br>army). On their left, the Kambojas, the Sakas, and the Yavanas, with cars<br>and horse and foot, at the command of the Suta's son, stood, challenging<br>Arjuna and the mighty Keshava. In the centre, at the head of that host,<br>stood Karna, clad in armour with beautiful coat of mail and adorned with<br>Angadas and garlands, for protecting that point. Supported by his own<br>angry sons, that foremost of all wielders of weapons, that hero, shone<br>resplendent at the head of the army as he drew his bow repeatedly. The<br>mighty-armed Duhshasana, possessed of the effulgence of the sun or fire<br>with tawny eyes and handsome features, riding on the neck of a huge<br>elephant, surrounded by many troops, and stationed at the rear of the<br>army gradually approached for fight. Behind him came Duryodhana himself,<br>O monarch, protected by his uterine brothers riding on beautiful steeds<br>and cased in beautiful mail. Protected by the united Madrakas and the<br>Kekayas of exceeding energy, the king, O monarch, looked resplendent like<br>Indra of a hundred sacrifices when surrounded by the celestials.<br>Ashvatthama and the other foremost of mighty car-warriors, and many<br>ever-infuriate elephants shedding temporal secretions like the very<br>clouds and ridden by brave Mlecchas, followed behind that car-force.<br>Decked with triumphal standards and blazing weapons, those huge<br>creatures, ridden by warriors skilled in fighting from their backs,<br>looked beautiful like hills overgrown with trees. Many thousands of brave<br>and unreturning warriors, armed with axes and swords, became the<br>footguards of those elephants. Gorgeously decked with horsemen and<br>car-warriors and elephants, that foremost of arrays looked exceedingly<br>beautiful like the array of the celestials or of the Asuras. That great<br>array, formed according to the scheme of Brihaspati by its commander,<br>well-versed in ways of battle, seemed to dance (as it advanced) and<br>struck terror into the hearts of foes. Like ever-appearing clouds in the<br>season of rains, foot-soldiers and horsemen and car-warriors and<br>elephants, longing for battle began to issue from the wings and further<br>wings of that array. Then king Yudhishthira, beholding Karna at the head<br>of the (hostile) army, addressed Dhananjaya, that slayer of foes, that<br>one hero in the world, and said these words, "Behold, O Arjuna, the<br>mighty array formed by Karna in battle. The hostile force looks<br>resplendent with its wings and further wings. At sight of this vast<br>hostile force, let such measures be adopted that it may not vanquish us.'<br>Thus addressed by the king, Arjuna replied with joined hands, 'Everything<br>will be done as thou sayest. Nothing will be otherwise. I will, O<br>Bharata, do that by which the destruction of the enemy may be compassed.<br>By slaying their foremost of warriors, I will achieve their destruction."<br><br>"'Yudhishthira said, "With that view, do thou proceed against the son of<br>Radha, and let Bhimasena proceed against Suyodhana, Nakula against<br>Virshasena, Sahadeva against the son of Subala, Satanika against<br>Duhshasana, that bull amongst the Sinis, viz., Satyaki, against the son<br>of Hridika, and Pandya against the son of Drona. I myself will fight with<br>Kripa. Let the sons of Draupadi with Shikhandi amongst them, proceed<br>against the rest of the Dhartarashtras. Let the other warriors of our<br>army encounter our other foes.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed by Yudhishthira the just, Dhananjaya<br>saying, "So be it," ordered his troops (to do the needful) and himself<br>proceeded to the head of the army. That car for which the Leader of the<br>universe, viz., Agni, who derives his effulgence from Brahman, became the<br>steeds, that car which was known amongst the gods as belonging to Brahman<br>because it sprang first from Brahman himself, that car which in days of<br>old had successively borne Brahman and Ishana and Indra and Varuna one<br>after another, riding on that primeval car, Keshava and Arjuna now<br>proceeded to battle. Beholding that advancing car of wonderful aspect,<br>Shalya once more said unto Adhiratha's son, that warrior of great energy<br>in battle, these words "Yonder comes that car having white steeds yoked<br>unto it and owning Krishna for its driver, that vehicle incapable of<br>being resisted by all the troops, like the inevitable fruit of work.<br>There comes the son of Kunti, slaughtering his foes along the way,&#8212;he,<br>that is, about whom thou hadst been enquiring. Since tremendous is the<br>uproar that is being heard, deep as the roar of the clouds, it is,<br>without doubt, those high-souled ones, viz., Vasudeva and Dhananjaya.<br>Yonder ascends a cloud of dust that overspreads the welkin like a canopy.<br>The whole Earth, O Karna, seems to tremble, cut deep by the circumference<br>of Arjuna's wheels. These violent winds are blowing on both sides of thy<br>army. These carnivorous creatures are yelling aloud and these animals are<br>uttering fearful cries. Behold, O Karna, the terrible and portentous Ketu<br>of vapoury form, making the hair to stand on end, hath appeared, covering<br>the Sun. Behold, diverse kinds of animals, all around in large packs, and<br>many mighty wolves and tigers are looking at the Sun. Behold those<br>terrible Kankas and those vultures, assembled together in thousands,<br>sitting with faces towards one another, in seeming discourse. Those<br>coloured yak-tails attached to thy great car are waving unquietly. Thy<br>standard also is trembling. Behold these thy beautiful steeds, of huge<br>limbs and great speed resembling that of soaring birds, are also<br>quivering. From these portents, it is certain that kings, in hundreds and<br>thousands, O Karna, deprived of life, will lie down on the ground for<br>eternal sleep. The loud uproar of conchs, making the hair to stand on<br>end, is being heard. The sound also of drums and cymbals, O son of Radha,<br>is being heard on all sides, as also the whizz of diverse kinds of<br>arrows, and the din made by cars and steeds and men. Listen also, O<br>Karna, to the loud twang produced by the bow-strings of high-souled<br>warriors. Behold, O Karna, those banners of Arjuna, that are equipped<br>with rows of bells, and decked with golden moons and stars. Made by<br>skilful artists out of cloths embroidered with gold and of diverse hues,<br>they are blazing with resplendence on Arjuna's car as they are shaken by<br>the wind, like flashes of lightning in a mass of clouds. Behold those<br>(other) banners producing sharp sounds as they wave in the air. Those<br>car-warriors of the high-souled Pancalas, with flag-decked standards on<br>their vehicles, are looking resplendent, O Karna, like the very gods on<br>their celestial cars. Behold the heroic son of Kunti, the unvanquished<br>Vibhatsu (Arjuna) with that foremost of apes on his standard, advancing<br>for the destruction of the foe. There, on the top of Partha's standard,<br>is to be seen that terrible ape, that enhancer of the fears of foes,<br>attracting the gaze (of warriors) from every side. The discus, the mace,<br>the bow called Saranga and the conch (called Panchajanya) of the<br>intelligent Krishna, as also his gem Kaustubha, look exceedingly<br>beautiful in him. The wielder of Saranga and the mace, viz., Vasudeva, of<br>great energy, cometh, urging those white steeds endued with the fleetness<br>of the wind. Yonder twangs Gandiva, drawn by Savyasaci. Those whetted<br>shafts, sped by that strong-armed hero, are destroying his enemies. The<br>Earth is strewn with the heads of unretreating kings, with faces<br>beautiful as the moon at full, and decked with large and expansive eyes<br>of coppery hue. There the arms, looking like spiked maces, with weapons<br>in grasp, and smeared with excellent perfumes, of warriors delighting in<br>battle and contending with uplifted weapons, are falling. Steeds with<br>eyes, tongues, and entrails drawn out along with their riders, are<br>falling and fallen and deprived of life lie prostrate on the Earth. Those<br>lifeless elephants huge as mountain summits, torn, mangled, and pierced<br>by Partha, are falling down like veritable hills. Those cars, looking<br>like the changeful forms of vapour in the sky, with their royal riders<br>slain, are falling down like the celestial cars of the denizens of heaven<br>upon the exhaustion of the latter's merits. Behold, the army is<br>exceedingly agitated by the diadem-decked Arjuna, like herds of countless<br>cattle by a maned lion. There the Pandava heroes, advancing for the<br>attack, are slaying kings and large numbers of elephants and steeds and<br>car-warriors and foot-soldiers of thy army engaged in battle. There<br>Partha, shrouded (by friends and foes and weapons and dust) is not to be<br>seen, like the Sun shrouded by clouds. Only the top of his standard may<br>be seen and the twang of his bow-string may be heard. Thou art sure, O<br>Karna, to behold today that hero of white steed with Krishna for his<br>driver, engaged in slaughtering his foes in battle. Thou art sure of<br>beholding him about whom thou hadst been enquiring. Today, O Karna, thou<br>art sure to behold those two tigers among men, both of red eyes, both<br>chastisers of foes, viz., Vasudeva and Arjuna, stationed on the same car.<br>If, O son of Radha, thou succeedest in slaying him that hath Keshava for<br>his driver and Gandiva for his bow, then thou shalt be our king.<br>Challenged by the samsaptakas, Partha now proceedeth against them. That<br>mighty warrior is engaged in making a great slaughter of his foes in<br>battle." Unto the ruler of the Madras who was saying so, Karna, in rage,<br>said, "Behold, Partha is assailed on all sides by the angry samsaptakas.<br>Like the Sun shrouded by the clouds, Partha is no longer visible.<br>Plunged, into that ocean of warriors, O Shalya, Arjuna is sure to perish."<br><br>"'Shalya said, "Who is there that would slay Varuna with water, or quench<br>fire with fuel? Who is there that would seize the wind, or drink off the<br>ocean? I regard thy act of afflicting Partha to be even such. Arjuna is<br>incapable of being vanquished in battle by the very gods and the Asuras<br>united together and having Indra himself at their head. Or, suffer<br>thyself to be gratified, and be of easy mind, having said those words<br>(about thy capacity to slay Partha) Partha cannot be conquered in battle.<br>Accomplish some other purpose thou mayst have in thy mind. He that would<br>uplift this Earth on his two arms, or burn all creatures in wrath, or<br>hurl the gods from heaven, may vanquish Arjuna in battle. Behold that<br>other heroic son of Kunti, viz., Bhima, who is never fatigued with<br>exertion, blazing with resplendence, mighty-armed, and standing like<br>another Meru. With wrath ever kindled and longing for revenge, Bhima of<br>great energy stands there desirous of victory in battle, and remembering<br>all his injuries. There that foremost of virtuous men, viz., king<br>Yudhishthira the just, that subjugator of hostile towns, stands difficult<br>of being resisted by foes in battle. There stand those two tigers among<br>men, the twin Ashvinis, the two uterine brothers Nakula and Sahadeva,<br>both invincible in battle. Yonder may be seen the five sons of Krishna,<br>that have the features of Pancala princes. All of them, equal to Arjuna<br>in battle, are standing, desirous of fight. There the sons of Drupada,<br>headed by Dhristadyumna, swelling with pride and energy,&#8212;heroes endued<br>with great energy,&#8212;have taken up their stand. There, that foremost one<br>among the Satwatas, viz., Satyaki, irresistible like Indra, advanceth<br>against us, from desire of fight, like the destroyer himself in wrath<br>before our eyes." While those two lions among men were thus addressing<br>each other, the two armies mingled fiercely in battle, like the currents<br>of the Ganga and Yamuna.'"
