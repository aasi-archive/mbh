                            "Sanjaya said, 'Hearing these words of Keshava, O Bharata, Vibhatsu soon<br>cast off his anxiety and became cheerful. Rubbing then the string of<br>gandiva and stretching it, he held his bow for the destruction of Karna,<br>and addressed Keshava, saying, 'With thee for my protector, O Govinda,<br>and when thou that art acquainted with the past and the future art<br>gratified with me today, victory is sure to be mine. Aided by thee, O<br>Krishna, I can, in great battle, destroy the three worlds assembled<br>together, what need be said of Karna then? I see the Pancala host is<br>flying away, O Janardana. I see also Karna careering fearlessly in<br>battle. I see too the bhargava weapon careering in all directions, having<br>been invoked by Karna, O thou of Vrishni's race, like the puissant<br>thunder invoked by Shakra. This is that battle in which Karna will be<br>slain by me and of which all creatures will speak as long as the earth<br>will last. Today, O Krishna, unbarbed arrows, impelled by my arms and<br>sped from the gandiva, mangling Karna, will take him to Yama. Today king<br>Dhritarashtra will curse that intelligence of his in consequence of which<br>he had installed Duryodhana, who was undeserving of sovereignty, on the<br>throne. Today, O mighty-armed one, Dhritarashtra will be divested of<br>sovereignty, happiness, prosperity, kingdom, city, and sons. I tell thee<br>truly, O Krishna, that today, Karna being slain, Duryodhana will become<br>hopeless of both life and kingdom. Today, beholding Karna cut in pieces<br>by me with my arrows, like Vritra in days of yore by Indra in the battle<br>between the gods and the asuras, let king Duryodhana call to mind the<br>words thou hast spoken for bringing about peace. Today let the son of<br>Subala, O Krishna, know that my shafts are dice, my gandiva the box for<br>throwing them, and my car, the chequered cloth. O Govinda, slaying Karna<br>with keen shafts I will dispel the long sleeplessness of Kunti's son.<br>Today the royal son of Kunti, upon the slaughter of the Suta's son by me,<br>shall be gratified and be of cheerful heart and obtain happiness for<br>ever. Today, O Keshava, I will shoot an irresistible and unrivalled arrow<br>that will deprive Karna of life. Even this, O Krishna, was the vow of<br>that wicked-souled one about my slaughter, viz., 'I will not wash my feet<br>till I slay Phalguna.' Falsifying this vow of that wretch, O slayer of<br>Madhu, I will, with straight shafts, throw down his body today from his<br>car. Today the earth will drink the blood of that Suta's son who in<br>battle condemns all other men on earth! With Dhritarashtra's approbation,<br>the Suta's son Karna, boasting of his own merits, had said, 'Thou hast no<br>husband now, O Krishna!' My keen shafts will falsify that speech of his.<br>Like angry snakes of virulent poison, they will drink his life-blood.<br>Cloth-yard shafts, of the effulgence of the lightning, shot by myself<br>possessed of mighty arms, sped from Gandiva, will send Karna on his last<br>journey. Today the son of Radha will repent for those cruel words that he<br>said unto the princess of Pancala in the midst of the assembly, in<br>disparagement of the Pandavas! They that were on that occasion sesame<br>seeds without kernel, will today become seeds with kernel after the fall<br>of the Suta's son Karna of wicked soul, otherwise called Vaikartana! 'I<br>will save ye from the sons of Pandu!'&#8212;even these were the words that<br>Karna, bragging of his own merits, said unto the sons of Dhritarashtra!<br>My keen shafts will falsify that speech of his! Today, in the very sight<br>of all the bowmen, I will slay that Karna who said, 'I will slay all the<br>Pancalas with their sons.' Today, O slayer of Madhu, I will slay that<br>Karna, that son of Radha, relying on whose prowess the proud son of<br>Dhritarashtra, of wicked understanding, always disregarded us. Today, O<br>Krishna, after Karna's fall, the Dhartarashtras with their king, struck<br>with panic, will fly away in all directions, like deer afraid of the<br>lion. Today let king Duryodhana repent upon the slaughter of Karna, with<br>his sons and relatives, by me in battle. Today, beholding Karna slain,<br>let the wrathful son of Dhritarashtra, O Krishna, know me to be the<br>foremost of all bowmen in battle. Today, I will make king Dhritarashtra,<br>with his sons and grandsons and counsellors and servants, shelterless.<br>Today, cranes and other carnivorous birds will, O Keshava, sport over the<br>limbs of Karna cut off into pieces with my shafts. Today, O slayer of<br>Madhu, I will cut off in battle the head of Radha's son Karna, in the<br>very sight of all the bowmen. Today, O slayer of Madhu, I will cut off in<br>battle the limbs of Radha's son of wicked soul with keen vipathas and<br>razor-faced arrows. Today, the heroic king Yudhishthira will cast off a<br>great pain and a great sorrow cherished long in his heart. Today, O<br>Keshava, slaying the son of Radha, with all his kinsmen, I will gladden<br>king Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma. Today, I will slay the cheerless<br>followers of Karna in battle, with shafts resembling the blazing fire or<br>the poison of the snake. Today, with my straight shafts equipped with<br>vulturine feathers, I will, O Govinda, cause the earth to be strewn with<br>(the bodies of) kings cased in golden armour. Today, O slayer of Madhu, I<br>will, with keen shafts, crush the bodies and cut off the heads of all the<br>foes of Abhimanyu. Today, I will bestow the earth, divested of<br>Dhartarashtras on my brother, or, perhaps, thou, O Keshava, wilt walk<br>over the earth divested of Arjuna! Today, O Krishna, I will free myself<br>from the debt I owe to all bowmen, to my own wrath, to the Kurus, to my<br>shafts, and to gandiva. Today, I will be freed from the grief that I have<br>cherished for thirteen years, O Krishna, by slaying Karna in battle like<br>Maghavat slaying Samvara. Today, after I have slain Karna in battle, let<br>the mighty car-warriors of the Somakas, who are desirous of accomplishing<br>the task of their allies, regard their task as accomplished. I do not<br>know what will be the measure, O Madhava, of the joy of Sini's grandson<br>today after I shall have slain Karna and won the victory. Today, I will<br>slay Karna in battle as also his son, that mighty car-warrior, and give<br>joy to Bhima and the twins and Satyaki. Today, slaying Karna in dreadful<br>battle, I will pay off my debt, O Madhava, to the Pancalas with<br>Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi! Today let all behold the wrathful<br>Dhananjaya fight with the Kauravas in battle and slay the Suta's son.<br>Once more there is none equal to me in the world. In prowess also, who is<br>there that resembles me? What other man is there that is equal to me in<br>forgiveness? In wrath also, there is no one that is equal to me. Armed<br>with the bow and aided by the prowess of my arms, I can vanquish the<br>Asuras and the gods and all creatures united together. Know that my<br>prowess is higher than the highest. Alone assailing all the Kurus and the<br>Bahlikas with the fire of my shafts issuing from Gandiva, I will, putting<br>forth my might, burn them with their followers like a fire in the midst<br>of a heap of dry grass at the close of winter. My palms bear these marks<br>of arrows and this excellent and outstretched bow with arrow fixed on the<br>string. On each of the soles of my feet occur the mark of a car and a<br>standard. When a person like me goeth forth to battle, he cannot be<br>vanquished by any one." Having said these words unto Acyuta, that<br>foremost of all heroes, that slayer of foes, with blood red eyes,<br>proceeded quickly to battle, for rescuing Bhima and cutting off the head<br>from Karna's trunk.'"
