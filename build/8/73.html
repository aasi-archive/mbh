                            "Sanjaya said, 'Once more Keshava of immeasurable soul said these words<br>unto Arjuna, who, O Bharata, was advancing (to battle), firmly resolved<br>upon slaying Karna, 'Today is the seventeenth day, O Bharata, of this<br>terrible massacre of men and elephants and steeds. At the outset vast was<br>the host that belonged to you. Encountering the foe in battle, that host<br>has been very much reduced in numbers, O king! The Kauravas also, O<br>Partha, were numerous at first, teeming with elephants and steeds.<br>Encountering thee, however, as their foe, they have been nearly<br>exterminated in the van of battle! These lords of Earth and these<br>Srinjayas, united together, and these Pandava troops also, obtaining thy<br>invincible self as their leader, are maintaining their ground on the<br>field. Protected by thee, O slayer of foes, the Pancalas, the Matsyas,<br>the Karushas, and the Cedis, have caused a great destruction of thy foes.<br>Who is there that can vanquish the assembled Kauravas in battle? On the<br>other hand, who is there that can vanquish the mighty car-warriors of the<br>Pandavas protected by thee? Thou, however, art competent to vanquish in<br>battle the three worlds consisting of the gods, the asuras, and human<br>beings, united together. What need I say then of the Kaurava host? Save<br>thee, O tiger among men, who else is there, even if he resemble Vasava<br>himself in prowess, that could vanquish king Bhagadatta? So also, O<br>sinless one, all the lords of earth, united together, are incapable, O<br>Partha, of even gazing at this vast force that is protected by thee. So<br>also, O Partha, it is owing to their having been always protected by thee<br>that Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi succeeded in slaying Drona and Bhishma.<br>Who, indeed, O Partha, could vanquish in battle those two mighty<br>car-warriors of the Bharatas, Bhishma and Drona, both of whom were endued<br>with prowess equal to that of Sakra himself? Save thee, O tiger among<br>men, what other man in this world is able to vanquish those fierce lords<br>of akshauhinis, those unreturning and invincible heroes, all accomplished<br>in weapons and united together, Shantanu's son Bhishma, and Drona, and<br>Vaikartana, and Kripa, and Drona's son, and king Duryodhana himself?<br>Innumerable divisions of soldiers have been destroyed (by thee), their<br>steeds and cars and elephants having been mangled (with thy shafts).<br>Numberless Kshatriyas also, wrathful and fierce, hailing from diverse<br>provinces, have been destroyed by thee. Teeming with horses and<br>elephants, large bodies of combatants of diverse Kshatriya clans, such as<br>the Govasas, the Dasamiyas, the Vasatis, O Bharata, and the Easterners,<br>the Vatadhanas, and the Bhojas that are very sensitive of their honour,<br>approaching thee and Bhima, O Bharata, have met with destruction. Of<br>terrible deeds and exceedingly fierce, the Tusharas, the Yavanas, the<br>Khasas, the Darvabhisaras, the Daradas, the Sakas, the Kamathas, the<br>Ramathas, the Tanganas the Andhrakas, the Pulindas, the Kiratas of fierce<br>prowess, the Mlecchas, the Mountaineers, and the races hailing from the<br>sea-side, all endued with great wrath and great might, delighting in<br>battle and armed with maces, these all&#8212;united with the Kurus and<br>fighting wrathfully for Duryodhana's sake were incapable of being<br>vanquished in battle by anybody else save thee, O scorcher of foes! What<br>man, unprotected by thee, could advance, beholding the mighty and<br>swelling host of the Dhartarashtras arrayed in order of battle? Protected<br>by thee, O puissant one, the Pandavas, filled with wrath, and penetrating<br>into its midst, have destroyed that host shrouded with dust and<br>resembling a swollen sea. Seven days have elapsed since the mighty<br>Jayatsena, the ruler of the Magadhas, was slain in battle by Abhimanyu.<br>After that, 10,000 elephants, of fierce feats, that used to follow that<br>king, were slain by Bhimasena with his mace. After that, other elephants,<br>and car-warriors, by hundreds, have been destroyed by Bhima in that<br>exercise of his might. Even thus, O Partha, during the progress of this<br>awful battle, the Kauravas, with their steeds and carwarriors and<br>elephants, encountering Bhimasena and thee, O son of Pandu, have from<br>hence repaired to the region of Death. The van of the Kaurava army, O<br>Partha, having been struck down by the Pandavas, Bhishma shot showers of<br>fierce shafts, O sire! Conversant with the highest weapons, he shrouded<br>the Cedis, the Pancalas, the Karushas, the Matsyas, and the Kaikayas with<br>the shafts, and deprived them of life! The welkin became filled with<br>gold-winged and straight coursing shafts, capable of piercing the bodies<br>of all foes, that issued out of his bow. He slew thousands of<br>car-warriors, shooting showers of shafts at a time. In all, he slew a<br>100,000 men and elephants of great might. Abandoning the diverse motions,<br>each of a new kind, in which they careered, those wicked kings and<br>elephants, while perishing, destroyed many steeds and cars and elephants.<br>Indeed, numberless were the shafts that Bhishma shot in battle.<br>Slaughtering the Pandava host for ten days together, Bhishma made the<br>terraces of numberless cars empty and deprived innumerable elephants and<br>steeds of life. Having assumed the form of Rudra or of Upendra in battle,<br>he afflicted the Pandava divisions and caused a great carnage amongst<br>them. Desirous of rescuing the wicked Suyodhana who was sinking in a<br>raftless sea, he slaughtered many lords of Earth among the Cedis, the<br>Pancalas, and the Kaikayas, and caused a great massacre of the Pandava<br>army teeming with cars and steeds and elephants. Innumerable<br>foot-soldiers among the Srinjayas, all well-armed, and other lords of<br>earth, were incapable of even looking at that hero when he careered in<br>battle like the Sun himself of scorching splendour. At last the Pandavas,<br>with all their resources, made a mighty effort, and rushed against that<br>warrior who, inspired with the desire of victory, used to career in<br>battle even in this way. Without availing himself of any aid, he routed,<br>however, the Pandavas and the Srinjayas in battle, and came to be<br>regarded as the one foremost hero in the world. Encountering him,<br>Shikhandi, protected by thee, slew that tiger among men with his straight<br>shafts. Having obtained thee that art a tiger among men (as his foe),<br>that grandsire is now stretched on a bed of arrows, like Vritra when he<br>obtained Vasava for his foe. The fierce Drona also slaughtered the<br>hostile army for five days together. Having made an impenetrable array<br>and caused many mighty car-warriors to be slain, that great car-warrior<br>had protected Jayadratha (for some time). Fierce as the Destroyer<br>himself, he caused a great carnage in the nocturnal battle. Endued with<br>great valour, the heroic son of Bharadwaja consumed innumerable<br>combatants with his arrows. At last, encountering Dhrishtadyumna, he<br>attained to the highest end. If, on that day, thou hadst not checked in<br>battle all the (Dhartarashtra) car-warriors headed by the Suta's son,<br>Drona then would never have been slain. Thou heldst in check the whole<br>Dhartarashtra force. It was for this, O Dhananjaya, that Drona could be<br>slain by the son of Prishata. What other Kshatriya, save thee, could in<br>battle achieve such feats for compassing the slaughter of Jayadratha.<br>Checking the vast (Kaurava) army and slaying many brave kings, thou<br>killedest king Jayadratha, aided by the might and energy of thy weapons.<br>All the kings regarded the slaughter of the ruler of the Sindhus to have<br>been exceedingly wonderful. I, however, do not regard it so; thou didst<br>it and thou art a great car-warrior. If this vast assemblage of<br>Kshatriyas, obtaining thee as a foe, suffer extermination in course of<br>even a whole day, I should, I think, still regard these Kshatriyas to be<br>truly mighty. When Bhishma and Drona have been slain, the terrible<br>Dhartarashtra host, O Partha, may be regarded to have lost all its<br>heroes. Indeed, with all its foremost warriors slain, with its steeds,<br>cars, and elephants destroyed, the Bharata army looketh today like the<br>firmament, reft of the Sun, the Moon, and stars. Yonder host of fierce<br>prowess, O Partha, hath been shorn of its splendours today like the Asura<br>host in days of yore shorn of its splendours by Sakra's prowess. The<br>remnant of that grand master now consists of only five great<br>car-warriors, viz., Ashvatthama, Kritavarma, Karna, Shalya, and Kripa.<br>Slaying those five great car-warriors today, O tiger among men, be thou a<br>hero that hath killed all his foes, and bestow thou the Earth with all<br>her islands and cities on king Yudhishthira. Let Pritha's son<br>Yudhishthira of immeasurable energy and prosperity, obtain today the<br>whole earth with the welkin above it, the waters on it, and the nether<br>regions below it. Slaying this host like Vishnu in days of yore slaying<br>the Daityas and the Danavas, bestow the Earth on the king like Hari<br>bestowing (the three worlds) on Sakra. Let the Pancalas rejoice today,<br>their foes being slain, like the celestials rejoicing after the slaughter<br>of the Danavas by Vishnu. If in consequence of thy regard for that<br>foremost of men, viz., thy preceptor Drona, thou cherishest compassion<br>for Ashvatthama, if, again, thou hast any kindness for Kripa for the sake<br>of respect that is due to a preceptor, if, approaching Kritavarma, thou<br>dost not despatch him today to Yama's abode in consequence of the honour<br>that is due to one's kinsmen by the mother's side, if, O lotus-eyed one,<br>approaching thy mother's brother, viz., Shalya, the ruler of the Madras,<br>thou dost not from compassion slay him, I ask thee, do thou, with keen<br>shafts, O foremost of men slay Karna today with speed, that vile wretch<br>of sinful heart who cherisheth the fiercest hate for the son of Pandu.<br>This is thy noblest duty. There is nothing in it that would be improper.<br>We approve of it, and here is no fault in the act. The wicked-souled<br>Karna is the root, O thou of unfading glory, of that attempt, O sinless<br>one, made in the night for burning thy mother with all her children, and<br>of that conduct which Suyodhana adopted towards you in consequence of<br>that match at dice. Suyodhana always hopeth for deliverance through<br>Karna. Filled with rage, he endeavours to afflict me also (in consequence<br>of that support). It is the firm belief of Dhritarashtra's royal son, O<br>giver of honours, that Karna, without doubt, will slay all the Prithas in<br>battle. Though fully acquainted with thy might, still, O son of Kunti,<br>Dhritarashtra's son hath selected war with you in consequence of his<br>reliance on Karna. Karna also always says, 'I will vanquish the assembled<br>Parthas and that mighty car-warrior, viz., Vasudeva of Dasharha's race'.<br>Buoying up the wicked-souled son of Dhritarashtra, the wicked Karna<br>always roareth in the (Kuru) assembly. Slay him today, O Bharata. In all<br>the acts of injury, of which Dhritarashtra's son hath been guilty towards<br>you, the wicked-souled Karna of sinful understanding hath been the<br>leader. I saw the heroic son of Subhadra of eyes like those of a bull,<br>slain by six mighty car-warriors of cruel heart belonging to the<br>Dhritarashtra army. Grinding those bulls among men, viz., Drona, Drona's<br>son, Kripa and other heroes, he deprived elephants of their riders and<br>mighty car-warriors of their cars. The bull-necked Abhimanyu, that<br>spreader of the fame of both the Kurus and the Vrishnis, deprived steeds<br>also of their riders and foot-soldiers of weapons and life. Routing the<br>(Kaurava) divisions and afflicting many mighty car-warriors, he<br>despatched innumerable men and steeds and elephants to Yama's abode. I<br>swear by Truth to thee, O friend, that my limbs are burning at the<br>thought that while the son of Subhadra was thus advancing, consuming the<br>hostile army with his shafts, even on that occasion the wicked-souled<br>Karna was engaged in acts of hostility to that hero, O lord! Unable, O<br>Partha, to stay in that battle before Abhimanyu's face, mangled with the<br>shafts of Subhadra's son, deprived of consciousness, and bathed in blood,<br>Karna drew deep breaths, inflamed with rage. At last, afflicted with<br>arrows, he was obliged to turn his back upon the field. Eagerly desirous<br>of flying away and becoming hopeless of life, he stayed for some time in<br>battle, perfectly stupefied and exhausted with the wounds he had<br>received. At last hearing those cruel words of Drona in battle&#8212;words<br>that were suited to the hour&#8212;Karna cut off Abhimanyu's bow. Made bowless<br>by him in that battle, five great car-warriors then, well-versed in the<br>ways of foul warfare, slew that hero with showers of shafts. Upon the<br>slaughter of that hero, grief entered the heart of everyone. Only, the<br>wicked-souled Karna and Suyodhana laughed in joy. (Thou rememberest also)<br>the harsh and bitter words that Karna cruelly said unto Krishna in the<br>(Kuru) assembly, in the presence of the Pandavas and Kurus, 'The<br>Pandavas, O Krishna, are dead! They have sunk into eternal hell! O thou<br>of large hips, choose other lords now, O thou of sweet speeches! Enter<br>now the abode of Dhritarashtra as a serving woman, for, O thou of curving<br>eye-lashes, thy husbands are no more! The Pandavas will not, O Krishna,<br>be of any service to thee today! Thou art the wife of men that are<br>slaves, O princess of Pancala, and thou art thyself, O beautiful lady, a<br>slave! Today only Duryodhana is regarded as the one king on earth; all<br>other kings of the world are worshipping the agency by which his<br>administration is kept up. Behold now, O amiable one, how all the sons of<br>Pandu have equally fallen! Overwhelmed by the energy of Dhritarashtra's<br>son, they are now silently eyeing one another. It is evident that they<br>are all sesame seeds without kernel, and have sunk into hell. They will<br>have to serve the Kaurava (Duryodhana), that king of kings, as his<br>slaves.' Even these were the foul words that that wretch, viz., the<br>sinful Karna of exceedingly wicked heart, spoke on that occasion, in thy<br>hearing, O Bharata! Let gold-decked shafts whetted on stone and capable<br>of taking the life of him at whom they are sped, shot by thee, quench<br>(the fire of) those words and all the other wrongs that that<br>wicked-souled wight did unto thee. Let thy shafts quench all those wrongs<br>and the life also of that wicked wight. Feeling the touch of terrible<br>arrows sped from Gandiva, let the wicked-souled Karna recollect today the<br>words of Bhishma and Drona! Let foe-killing cloth-yard shafts, equipped<br>with the effulgence of lightning, shot by thee, pierce his vital limbs<br>and drink his blood! Let fierce and mighty shafts, of great impetuosity,<br>sped by thy arms, penetrate the vitals of Karna today and despatch him to<br>Yama's abode. Let all the kings of the earth, cheerless and filled with<br>grief and uttering wails of woe, behold Karna fall down from his car<br>today, afflicted with thy arrows. Let his kinsmen, with cheerless faces,<br>behold Karna today, fallen down and stretched at his length on the earth,<br>dipped in gore and with his weapons loosened from his grasp! Let the<br>lofty standard of Adhiratha's son, bearing the device of the elephant's<br>rope, fall fluttering on the earth, cut off by thee with a broad-headed<br>arrow. Let Shalya fly away in terror, abandoning the gold-decked car (he<br>drives) upon seeing it deprived of its warrior and steeds and cut off<br>into fragments with hundreds of shafts by thee. Let thy enemy Suyodhana<br>today, beholding Adhiratha's son slain by thee, despair of both his life<br>and kingdom. Yonder, O Partha, Karna, equal unto Indra in energy, or,<br>perhaps, Sankara himself, is slaughtering thy troops with his shafts.<br>There the Pancalas, though slaughtered by Karna with his whetted shafts,<br>are yet, O chief of Bharata's race, rushing (to battle), for serving the<br>cause of the Pandavas. Know, O Partha, that is prevailing over the<br>Pancalas, and the (five) sons of Draupadi, and Dhrishtadyumna and<br>Shikhandi, and the sons of Dhrishtadyumna, and Satanika, the son of<br>Nakula, and Nakula himself, and Sahadeva, and Durmukha, and Janamejaya,<br>and Sudharman, and Satyaki! The loud uproar made by those allies of<br>thine, viz., the Pancalas, O scorcher of foes, as they are being struck<br>by Karna in dreadful battle, is heard. The Pancalas have not at all been<br>inspired with fear, nor do they turn away their faces from the battle.<br>Those mighty bowmen are utterly reckless of death in great battle.<br>Encountering even that Bhishma who, single-handed, had encompassed the<br>Pandava army with a cloud of shafts, the Pancalas did not turn away their<br>faces from him. Then again, O chastiser of foes, they always strove with<br>alacrity to vanquish forcibly in battle their great foe, viz., the<br>invincible Drona, that preceptor of all wielders of the bow, that blazing<br>fire of weapons, that hero who always burnt his foes in battle. They have<br>never turned their faces from battle, afraid of Adhiratha's son. The<br>heroic Karna, however, with his shafts, is taking the lives of the<br>Pancala warriors endued with great activity as they are advancing against<br>him, like a blazing fire taking the lives of myriads of insects. The son<br>of Radha, in this battle, is destroying in hundreds the Pancalas that are<br>advancing against him,&#8212;those heroes, that are resolved to lay down their<br>lives for the sake of their allies! It behoveth thee, O Bharata, to<br>become a raft and rescue those brave warriors, those great bowmen, that<br>are sinking in the raftless ocean represented by Karna. The awful form of<br>that weapon which was obtained by Karna from that foremost of sages,<br>viz., Rama of Bhrigu's race, hath been displayed. Scorching all the<br>troops, that weapon of exceedingly fierce and awful form is blazing with<br>its own energy, surrounding our vast army. Those arrows, sped from<br>Karna's bow, are coursing in battle thick as swarm of bees, and scorching<br>thy troops. Encountering Karna's weapon in battle, that is irresistible<br>by persons not having their souls under control, there the Pancalas, O<br>Bharata, are flying away in all directions! Yonder, Bhima, of<br>unappeasable wrath, surrounded on all sides by the Srinjayas, is fighting<br>with Karna, O Partha, afflicted by the latter with keen shafts! If<br>neglected, Karna will, O Bharata, exterminate the Pandavas, the<br>Srinjayas, and the Pancalas, like a neglected disease whose germ has<br>entered the body. Save thee I do not see another in Yudhishthira's army<br>that would come home safe and sound, having encountered the son of Radha<br>in battle. Slaying that Karna today with thy keen shafts, O bull among<br>men, act according to thy vow, O Partha, and win great fame. I tell thee<br>truly, thou only art able to vanquish in battle the Kaurava host with<br>Karna amongst them, and no one else, O foremost of warriors! Achieving<br>this great feat, viz., slaying the mighty car-warrior Karna, attain thy<br>object, O Partha, and crowned with success, be happy, O best of men!'"
