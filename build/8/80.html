                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then, O king, Dhananjaya, desirous of rescuing Kunti's<br>son Bhima who, assailed by many, foremost of warriors of the Kuru army,<br>seemed to sink (under that attack), avoided, O Bharata, the troops of the<br>Suta's son and began, with his shafts, to despatch those hostile heroes<br>(that were opposed to Bhima) to the regions of death. Successive showers<br>of Arjuna's shafts were seen overspread on the sky, while others were<br>seen to slay thy army. Filling the welkin with his shafts that resembled<br>dense flights of feathery creatures, Dhananjaya, O monarch, at that time,<br>became the very Destroyer unto the Kurus. With his broad-headed arrows,<br>and those equipped with heads flat and sharp as razors, and cloth-yard<br>shafts of bright polish, Partha mangled the bodies of his foes and cut<br>off their heads. The field of battle became strewn with falling warriors,<br>some with bodies cut and mangled, some divested of armour and some<br>deprived of heads. Like the great Vaitarani (separating the regions of<br>life from those of the dead), the field of battle, O king, became uneven<br>and impassable and unsightly and terrible, in consequence of steeds and<br>cars and elephants, which struck with Dhananjaya's shafts, were mangled<br>and crushed and cut off in diverse ways. The earth was also covered with<br>broken shafts and wheels and axles, and with cars that were steedless or<br>that had their steeds and others that were driverless or that had their<br>drivers. Then four hundred well-trained and ever-furious elephants,<br>excited with wrath, and ridden by warriors cased in mail of golden hue<br>and adorned with ornaments of gold, and urged by fierce guides with<br>pressure of heels and toes, fell down, struck by the diadem-decked Arjuna<br>with his shafts, like loosened summits, peopled with living creatures, of<br>gigantic mountains. Indeed, the earth became covered with (other) huge<br>elephants struck down by Dhananjaya with his arrows. Like the sun<br>piercing through masses of clouds, Arjuna's car passed through dense<br>bodies of elephants with juicy secretions flowing down their bodies and<br>looking like masses of clouds. Phalguna caused his track to be heaped up<br>with slain elephants and steeds, and with cars broken in diverse ways,<br>and with lifeless heroes deprived of weapons and engines and of armour,<br>as also with arms of diverse kinds loosened from hands that held them.<br>The twang of Gandiva became tremendously loud, like the peal of thunder<br>in the welkin. The (Dhartarashtra) army then, smitten with the shafts of<br>Dhananjaya, broke, like a large vessel on the bosom of the ocean<br>violently lashed by the tempest. Diverse kinds of fatal shafts, sped from<br>Gandiva, and resembling burning brands and meteors and thunderbolts,<br>burnt thy army. That mighty host, thus afflicted with Dhananjaya's<br>shafts, looked beautiful like a blazing forest of bamboos on a mountain<br>in the night. Crushed and burnt and thrown into confusion, and mangled<br>and massacred by the diadem-decked Arjuna with his arrows, that host of<br>thine then fled away on all sides. Indeed, the Kauravas, burnt by<br>Savyasaci, dispersed on all sides, like animals in the great forest<br>frightened at a forest conflagration. The Kuru host then (that had<br>assailed Bhimasena) abandoning that mighty-armed hero, turned their faces<br>from battle, filled with anxiety. After the Kurus had been routed, the<br>unvanquished Vibhatsu, approaching Bhimasena, stayed there for a moment.<br>Having met Bhima and held a consultation with him, Phalguna informed his<br>brother that the arrows had been extracted from Yudhishthira's body and<br>that the latter was perfectly well.<br><br>"'With Bhimasena's leave, Dhananjaya then proceeded (once more against<br>his foes), causing the earth and the welkin, O Bharata, to resound with<br>the rattle of his car. He was then surrounded by ten heroic and foremost<br>of warriors, viz., thy sons, all of whom were Duhshasana's juniors in<br>age. Afflicting Arjuna with their shafts like hunters afflicting an<br>elephant with burning brands, those heroes, with outstretched bow, seemed<br>to dance, O Bharata, (on their cars). The slayer of Madhu then, guiding<br>his, car placed all of them to his right. Indeed, he expected that Arjuna<br>would very soon send all of them to Yama's presence. Beholding Arjuna's<br>car proceeding in a different direction, those heroes rushed towards him.<br>Soon, however, Partha, with a number of cloth-yard shafts and<br>crescent-shaped arrows, cut off their standards and steeds and bows and<br>arrows, causing them to fall down on the earth. Then with some<br>broad-headed arrows he cut off and felled their heads decked with lips<br>bit and eyes blood-red in rage. Those faces looked beautiful like an<br>assemblage of lotuses. Having slain those ten Kauravas cased in golden<br>mail, with ten broad-headed shafts endued with great, impetuosity and<br>equipped with wings of gold that slayer of foes, Arjuna continued to<br>proceed.'"
