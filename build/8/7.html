                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'When all the foremost of my warriors, O Sanjaya<br>have perished, I do not think that the remnant of my army will not<br>perish! When those two heroes, those two mighty bowmen, those two<br>foremost of the Kurus, Bhishma and Drona, have been slain, what use can I<br>any longer have with life? I cannot also brook the death of Radha's son,<br>that ornament of battle, the might of whose arms was as great as that of<br>10,000 elephants! O foremost of speakers, tell me now, O Suta, who are<br>yet alive in my army after the death of all the foremost heroes! Thou<br>hast told me the names of those that have fallen. It seems, however, to<br>me that those who are still alive are almost all dead!'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'That hero O king, to whom Drona, that foremost of<br>brahmanas, imparted many blazing, celestial, and mighty weapons of the<br>four kinds, that mighty car-warrior, possessed of skill and lightness of<br>hands, that hero of firm grasp, strong weapons, and powerful shafts, that<br>high-souled son of Drona, capable of shooting to a great distance, is<br>still on the field, desirous of battling for thy sake. That dweller of<br>the Anarta country, that son of Hridika, that mighty car-warrior, that<br>foremost one among the Satwatas, that chief of the Bhojas, Kritavarma,<br>accomplished in arms, is on the field, desirous of battle. Artayana's<br>son, dauntless in battle, that first of warriors, that foremost of all<br>yet on thy side, he, that abandoned his own sister's sons, the Pandavas,<br>for making his own words true, that hero endued with great activity who<br>promised in the presence of Yudhishthira that he would in battle depress<br>the proud spirit of Karna, that invincible Shalya, who is equal unto<br>Sakra himself in energy, is still on the field, desirous of battling for<br>thy sake. Accompanied by his own force consisting of Ajaneyas,<br>Saindhavas, mountaineers, dwellers of riparian regions, Kambojas, and<br>Vanayus, the king of the Gandharas stayeth on the field, desirous of<br>battling for thy sake. Sharadvata's son called Gautama, O king, endued<br>with mighty arms and capable of fighting with diverse weapons in diverse<br>beautiful ways, taking up a beautiful and large bow capable of bearing<br>great strain, stayeth on the field, desirous of battle. That mighty<br>car-warrior, the son of the ruler of the Kaikeyas, riding on a goodly car<br>equipped with standard and goodly steeds, stayeth on the field, O chief<br>of Kuru's race, for battling for thy sake. Thy son also, that foremost of<br>heroes in Kuru's race, Purumitra, O king, riding on his car possessed of<br>the effulgence of fire or the Sun, stayeth on the field, like the Sun<br>himself shining brilliantly in the cloudless firmament. Duryodhana also,<br>endued with great energy, in the midst of an elephant force and<br>accompanied by many foremost of combatants, stayeth on his car adorned<br>with gold, desirous of engaging in battle. In the midst of many kings,<br>that foremost of men, possessed of the splendour of a lotus, looked<br>resplendent in his beautiful armour of gold like a fire with little smoke<br>or the Sun emerged from the clouds. So also thy sons Sushena, armed with<br>sword and shield, and the heroic Satyasena, are staying with Citrasena,<br>their hearts full of joy and themselves desirous of battle. Endued with<br>modesty, the Bharata princes Citrayudha, Srutavarman, and Jaya, Dala, and<br>Satyavrata, and Dussala, all of whom are possessed of great might, stay<br>on the field, desirous of battle. The ruler of the Kaitavyas, that prince<br>proud of his courage, and capable of fearlessly careering in battle and<br>slaying his foes, possessing foot-soldiers and cavalry, and elephants and<br>cars, stayeth on the field, desirous of battling for thy sake. The heroic<br>Srutayu and Srutayudha, and Citrangada and Citravarman, those foremost of<br>men, those proud warriors capable of smiting effectually and possessed of<br>sureness of aim, stay on the field, desirous of battle. The high-souled<br>Satyasandha, the son of Karna, stayeth on the field, desirous of battle.<br>Two other sons of Karna, possessing a knowledge of high weapons and<br>endued with great lightness of hands, are both staying, O king, at the<br>head of forces that are large and incapable of being pierced by warriors<br>of little energy, desirous of battling for thy sake. Accompanied by these<br>heroes and by many other foremost of warriors, O king, that are possessed<br>of immeasurable might, the Kuru king (Duryodhana) is staying like a<br>second Indra in the midst of his elephant division in expectation of<br>victory!'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Thou hast told me duly all that are alive both<br>amongst us and the foe. From this I plainly see on which side the victory<br>will be. Indeed, it may be inferred from the facts.'"<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "While saying this, Dhritarashtra the son of<br>Ambika, having learnt that only a small portion of his army was alive,<br>for all his foremost of warriors had died, felt his heart to be<br>exceedingly agitated by grief. The king swooned away. Partially restored<br>to his senses, he addressed Sanjaya, saying, 'Wait for a moment!' And the<br>king said, 'O son, having heard of this dire calamity, my heart is<br>greatly agitated. My senses are being stupefied, and my limbs are about<br>to be paralysed!' Having said these words, Dhritarashtra the son of<br>Ambika, that lord of earth, lost his senses and fell down on the earth."
