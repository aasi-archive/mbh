                            "Sanjaya said, 'That chastiser of foes, viz., the son of Radha, thus<br>silencing the ruler of the Madras, once more addressed him, O monarch,<br>saying these words, "In answer to that which, O Shalya, thou hast said<br>unto me by way of instance, I tell thee that I am incapable of being<br>frightened by thee in battle with thy words. If all the gods themselves<br>with Vasava would fight with me, I would not still feel any fear, what<br>need be said then of my fears from Pritha and Keshava? I am incapable of<br>being frightened by means of words alone. He, O Shalya, whom thou wouldst<br>be able to frighten in battle is some other person (and not myself)! Thou<br>hast spoken many bitter words to me. Therein lieth the strength of a<br>person that is low. Incapable of speaking of my merits, thou sayst many<br>bitter things, O thou of wicked heart; Karna was never born, O Madraka,<br>for fear in battle. On the other hand, I was born for displaying valour<br>as also for achieving glory for my own self. For the sake of my<br>friendship for thee, for my affection, and for thy being an ally,&#8212;for<br>these three reasons thou still livest, O Shalya. Important is the task<br>that has now to be done for king Dhritarashtra. That task, O Shalya,<br>depends on me. For this, thou livest a moment. Before this, I made a<br>compact with thee that any disagreeable speeches thou mightest utter<br>would be pardoned by me. That compact should be observed. It is for this<br>that thou livest, O Madraka. Without a 1,000 Salyas I would vanquish my<br>foes. He that injureth a friend is sinful. It is for this that thou<br>livest for the present.'"
