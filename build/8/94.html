                            "Sanjaya said, 'The ruler of the Madras then, beholding thy son employed<br>in rallying the troops, with fear depicted on his countenance and with<br>heart stupefied with grief, said these words unto Duryodhana.<br><br>"'Shalya said, "Behold this awful field of battle, O hero, covered with<br>heaps of slain men and steeds and elephants. Some tracts are covered with<br>fallen elephants huge as mountains, exceedingly mangled, their vital<br>limbs pierced with shafts, lying helplessly, deprived of life, their<br>armour displaced and the weapons, the shields and the swords with which<br>they were equipped lying scattered about. These fallen animals resemble<br>huge mountains riven with thunder, with their rocks and lofty trees and<br>herbs loosened from them and lying all around. The bells and iron hooks<br>and lances and standards with which those huge creatures had been<br>equipped are lying on the ground. Adorned with housings of gold, their<br>bodies are now bathed in blood. Some tracts, again, are covered with<br>fallen steeds, mangled with shafts, breathing hard in pain and vomitting<br>blood. Some of them are sending forth soft wails of pain, some are biting<br>the earth with rolling eyes and some are uttering piteous neighs.<br>Portions of the field are covered with horsemen and elephant-warriors<br>fallen off from their animals, and with bands of car-warriors forcibly<br>thrown down from their cars. Some of them are already dead and some are<br>at the point of death. Covered also with the corpses of men and steeds<br>and elephants as also with crushed cars and other huge elephants with<br>their trunks and limbs cut off, the earth has become awful to look at<br>like the great Vaitarani (skirting the domains of Yama). Indeed, the<br>earth looketh even such, being strewn with other elephants, stretched on<br>the ground with trembling bodies and broken tusks, vomiting blood,<br>uttering soft cries in pain, deprived of the warriors on their backs,<br>divested of the armour that covered their limbs, and reft of the<br>foot-soldiers that protected their flank and rear, and with their quivers<br>and banners and standards displaced, their bodies adorned with housings<br>of gold struck deep with the weapons of the foe. The earth looked like<br>the cloud-covered welkin in consequence of being strewn with the fallen<br>bodies of elephant-warriors and horse-men and carwarriors, all of great<br>fame, and of foot-soldiers slain by foes fighting face to face, and<br>divested of armour and ornaments and attire and weapons. Covered with<br>thousands of fallen combatants mangled with arrows, fully exposed to<br>view, and deprived of consciousness, with some amongst them whose breaths<br>were returning slowly, the earth seemed as if covered with many<br>extinguished fires. With those foremost of heroes among both the Kurus<br>and the Srinjayas, pierced with arrows and deprived of life by Partha and<br>Karna, the earth seemed as if strewn with blazing planets fallen from the<br>firmament, or like the nocturnal firmament itself bespangled with blazing<br>planets of serene light. The shafts sped from the arms of Karna and<br>Arjuna, piercing through the bodies of elephants and steeds and men and<br>quickly stilling their lives, entered the earth like mighty snakes<br>entering their holes with heads bent downwards. The earth has become<br>impassable with heaps of slain men and steeds and elephants, and with<br>cars broken with the shafts of Dhananjaya and Adhiratha's son and with<br>the numberless shafts themselves shot by them. Strewn with well-equipped<br>cars crushed by means of mighty shafts along with the warriors and the<br>weapons and the standards upon them, cars, that is, with their traces<br>broken, their joints separated, their axles and yokes and Trivenus<br>reduced to fragments, their wheels loosened, their Upaskaras destroyed,<br>their Anukarsanas cut in pieces, the fastenings of their quivers cut off,<br>and their niches (for the accommodation of drivers) broken, strewn with<br>those vehicles adorned with gems and gold, the earth looks like the<br>firmament overspread with autumnal clouds. In consequence of<br>well-equipped royal cars deprived of riders and dragged by fleet steeds,<br>as also of men and elephants and cars and horses that fled very quickly,<br>the army has been broken in diverse ways. Spiked maces with golden bells,<br>battle-axes, sharp lances, heavy clubs, mallets, bright unsheathed<br>swords, and maces covered with cloth of gold, have fallen on the field.<br>Bows decked with ornaments of gold, and shafts equipped with beautiful<br>wings of pure gold, and bright unsheathed rapiers of excellent temper,<br>and lances, and scimitars bright as gold, and umbrellas, and fans, and<br>conchs, and arms decked with excellent flowers and gold, and caparisons<br>of elephants, and standards, and car fences and diadems, and necklaces,<br>and brilliant crowns, and yak-tails lying about, O king, and garlands<br>luminous with corals and pearls, and chaplets for the head, and bracelets<br>for both the wrist and the upper arms, and collars for the neck with<br>strings of gold, and diverse kinds of costly diamonds and gems and<br>pearls, and bodies brought up in a great luxury, and heads beautiful as<br>the moon, are lying scattered about. Abandoning their bodies and<br>enjoyments and robes and diverse kinds of agreeable pleasures, and<br>acquiring great merit for the devotion they showed to the virtuous of<br>their order, they have speedily gone in a blaze of flame to regions of<br>bliss. Turn back, O Duryodhana! Let the troops retire! O king, O giver of<br>honours, proceed towards thy camp! There, the Sun is hanging low in the<br>welkin, O lord! Remember, O ruler of men, that thou art the cause of all<br>this!"<br><br>"'Having said these words unto Duryodhana, Shalya, with heart filled with<br>grief, stopped. Duryodhana, however, at that time, deeply afflicted and<br>deprived of his senses, and with eyes bathed in tears, wept for the<br>Suta's son, saying, "Karna! Oh Karna!" Then all the kings headed by<br>Drona's son, repeatedly comforting Duryodhana, proceeded towards the<br>camp, frequently looking back at the lofty standard of Arjuna that seemed<br>to be ablaze with his fame. At that terrible hour when everything around<br>looked so resplendent, the Kauravas, all of whom had resolved to repair<br>to the other world, their features incapable of recognition owing to the<br>blood that covered them, beholding the earth, that was drenched with the<br>blood flowing from the bodies of men and steeds and elephants, looking<br>like a courtesan attired in crimson robes and floral garlands and<br>ornaments of gold, were unable, O king, to stand there! Filled with grief<br>at the slaughter of Karna, they indulged in loud lamentations, saying,<br>"Alas, Karna! Alas Karna!" Beholding the Sun assume a crimson hue, all of<br>them speedily proceeded towards their camp. As regards Karna, though<br>slain and pierced with gold-winged shafts whetted on stone and equipped<br>with feathers and dyed in blood and sped from gandiva, yet that hero,<br>lying on the ground, looked resplendent like the Sun himself of bright<br>rays. It seemed that illustrious Surya, ever kind to his worshippers,<br>having touched with his rays the gore-drenched body of Karna, proceeded,<br>with aspect crimson in grief, to the other ocean from desire of a bath.<br>Thinking so, the throngs of celestials and rishis (that had come there<br>for witnessing the battle) left the scene for proceeding to their<br>respective abodes. The large crowd of other beings also, entertaining the<br>same thought, went away, repairing as they chose to heaven or the earth.<br>The foremost of Kuru heroes also, having beheld that wonderful battle<br>between Dhananjaya and Adhiratha's son, which had inspired all living<br>creatures with dread, proceeded (to their nightly quarters), filled with<br>wonder and applauding (the encounter). Though his armour had been cut off<br>with arrows, and though he had been slain in course of that dreadful<br>fight, still that beauty of features which the son of Radha possessed did<br>not abandon him when dead. Indeed, everyone beheld the body of the hero<br>to resemble heated gold. It seemed to be endued with life and possessed<br>of the effulgence of fire or the sun. All the warriors, O king, were<br>inspired with fright at sight of the Suta's son lying dead on the field,<br>like other animals at sight of the lion. Indeed, though dead, that tiger<br>among men seemed ready to utter his commands. Nothing, in that<br>illustrious dead, seemed changed. Clad in beautiful attire, and possessed<br>of a neck that was very beautiful, the Suta's son owned a face which<br>resembled the full moon in splendour. Adorned with diverse ornaments and<br>decked with Angadas made of bright gold, Vaikartana, though slain, lay<br>stretched like a gigantic tree adorned with branches and twigs. Indeed,<br>that tiger among men lay like a heap of pure gold, or like a blazing fire<br>extinguished with the water of Partha's shafts. Even as a blazing<br>conflagration is extinguished when it comes in contact with water, the<br>Karna-conflagration was extinguished by the Partha-cloud in the battle.<br>Having shot showers of arrows and scorched the ten points of the compass,<br>that tiger among men, viz., Karna, along with his sons, was quieted by<br>Partha's energy. He left the world, taking away with him that blazing<br>glory of his own which he had earned on earth by fair fight. Having<br>scorched the Pandavas and the Pancalas with the energy of his weapons,<br>having poured showers of arrows and burnt the hostile divisions, having,<br>indeed, heated the universe like the thousand-rayed Surya of great<br>beauty, Karna, otherwise called Vaikartana, left the world, with his sons<br>and followers. Thus fell that hero who was a Kalpa tree unto those swarms<br>of birds represented by suitors. Solicited by suitors he always said, "I<br>give" but never the words "I have not!" The righteous always regarded him<br>as a righteous person. Even such was Vrisha who fell in single combat.<br>All the wealth of that high-souled person had been dedicated to the<br>Brahmanas. There was nothing, not even his life, that he could not give<br>away unto the Brahmanas. He was ever the favourite of ladies, exceedingly<br>liberal, and a mighty car-warrior. Burnt by the weapons of Partha, he<br>attained to the highest end. He, relying upon whom thy son had provoked<br>hostilities, thus went to heaven, taking away with him the hope of<br>victory, the happiness, and the armour of the Kauravas. When Karna fell,<br>the rivers stood still. The Sun set with a pale hue. The planet Mercury,<br>the son of Soma, assuming the hue of fire or the Sun, appeared to course<br>through the firmament in a slanting direction. The firmament seemed to be<br>rent in twain; the earth uttered loud roars; violent and awful winds<br>began to blow. All the points of the horizon, covered with smoke, seemed<br>to be ablaze. The great oceans were agitated and uttered awful sounds.<br>The mountains with their forests began to tremble, and all creatures, O<br>sire, felt pain. The planet Jupiter, afflicting the constellation Rohini<br>assumed the hue of the moon or the sun. Upon the fall of Karna, the<br>subsidiary points also of the compass became ablaze. The sky became<br>enveloped in darkness. The earth trembled. Meteors of blazing splendour<br>fell. Rakshasas and other wanderers of the night became filled with joy.<br>When Arjuna, with that razor-faced shaft, struck off Karna's head adorned<br>with a face beautiful as the moon, then, O king, loud cries of "Oh!" and<br>"Alas!" were heard of creatures in heaven, in the welkin, and on the<br>earth. Having in battle slain his foe Karna who was worshipped by the<br>gods, the gandharvas, and human beings, Pritha's son Arjuna looked<br>resplendent in his energy like the deity of a 1,000 eyes after the<br>slaughter of Vritra. Then riding on that car of theirs whose rattle<br>resembled the roar of the clouds and whose splendour was like that of the<br>meridian sun of the autumnal sky, which was adorned with banners and<br>equipped with a standard incessantly producing an awful noise, whose<br>effulgence resembled that of the snow or the Moon or the conch or the<br>crystal, and whose steeds were like those of Indra himself, those two<br>foremost of men, viz., the son of Pandu and the crusher of Keshi, whose<br>energy resembled that of the great Indra, and who were adorned with gold<br>and pearls and gems and diamonds and corals, and who were like fire or<br>the sun in splendour, fearlessly careered over the field of battle with<br>great speed, like Vishnu and Vasava mounted on the same chariot. Forcibly<br>divesting the enemy of his splendour by means of the twang of gandiva and<br>the slaps of their palms, and slaying the Kurus with showers of shafts,<br>the Ape-bannered Arjuna, the Garuda-bannered Krishna, both of whom were<br>possessed of immeasurable prowess, those two foremost of men, filled with<br>joy, took up with their hands their loud-sounding conchs adorned with<br>gold and white as snow, and placing them against their lips, blew<br>simultaneously with those beautiful mouths of theirs, piercing the hearts<br>of their foes with the sound. The blare of pancajanya and that of<br>devadatta filled the earth, the sky, and heaven.<br><br>At the sound of the heroic Madhava's conch as also at that of Arjuna's,<br>all the Kauravas, O best of kings, became filled with fright. Those<br>foremost of men, causing the forests, the mountains, the rivers and the<br>points of the compass to resound with the blare of their conchs, and<br>filling the army of thy son with fright, gladdened Yudhishthira<br>therewith. As soon as the Kauravas heard the blare of those conchs that<br>were thus being blown, all of them left the field with great speed,<br>deserting the ruler of the Madras and the chief of the Bharatas, O<br>Bharata, viz., Duryodhana. Then diverse creatures, uniting together,<br>congratulated Dhananjaya, that hero shining resplendent on the field of<br>battle, as also Janardana, those two foremost of men who then looked like<br>a couple of risen suns. Pierced with Karna's arrows, those two chastisers<br>of foes, Acyuta and Arjuna, looked resplendent like the bright and<br>many-rayed moon and the sun risen after dispelling a gloom. Casting off<br>those arrows, those two mighty warriors, both endued with unrivalled<br>prowess, surrounded by well-wishers and friends, happily entered their<br>own encampment, like the lords Vasava and Vishnu duly invoked by<br>sacrificial priests. Upon the slaughter of Karna in that dreadful battle,<br>the gods, gandharvas, human beings, caranas, great rishis, yakshas, and<br>great nagas, worshipped Krishna and Arjuna with great respect and wished<br>them victory (in all things). Having received all their friends then,<br>each according to his age, and applauded by those friends in return for<br>their incomparable feats, the two heroes rejoiced with their friends,<br>like the chief of the celestials and Vishnu after the overthrow of Vali.'"
