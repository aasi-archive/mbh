                            "Sanjaya said, 'After the fall of the mighty bowman Drona on that day, O<br>Bharata, and after the purpose had been baffled of that mighty<br>car-warriors, viz., the son of Drona, and after the vasty army, O<br>monarch, of the Kauravas had fled away, Partha, having arrayed his own<br>troops, stayed on the field with his brothers. Perceiving him staying on<br>the field, thy son, O bull of Bharata's race, seeing his own army running<br>away, rallied them with great courage. Having caused his divisions to<br>take up their stand, thy son, O Bharata, relying on the might of his<br>arms, fought for a long time with his foes, the Pandavas, who, having<br>gained their end, were filled with joy and had been struggling for hours<br>together. On the approach there of the evening twilight, he caused the<br>troops to be withdrawn. Having caused the withdrawal of their troops, and<br>having entered their own encampment, the Kauravas held with one another a<br>consultation about their own welfare, seated like the celestials on<br>costly couches overlaid with rich coverlets, and on excellent seats and<br>luxurious beds. Then king Duryodhana, addressing those mighty bowmen in<br>agreeable and highly sweet expression, spoke the following words suited<br>to the occasion.<br><br>"'Duryodhana said, "Ye foremost of intelligent men, declare all of you,<br>without delay, your opinions! Under these circumstances, ye kings, what<br>is necessary and what is still more necessary?'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'When that prince of men had spoken those words,<br>those lions among men, seated on their thrones, made various gestures<br>expressive of their desire of battle. Observing the indications of those<br>who were all desirous of pouring their lives as libations on the<br>battle-fire, and beholding the monarch's face radiant as morning Sun, the<br>preceptor's son endued with intelligence and accomplished in speech, said<br>these words: "Enthusiasm, opportunity, skill and policy,&#8212;these are the<br>means declared by the learned, to be capable of accomplishing all ends.<br>They are, however, dependent on destiny. Those foremost of men we had on<br>our side, equal unto the celestials, mighty car-warriors all, possessed<br>of policy, devoted, accomplished, and loyal, have been slain. For all<br>that we should not despair of victory. If all these means be properly<br>applied, even destiny may be made propitious. All of us, therefore, O<br>Bharata, shall install Karna, that foremost of men, endued besides with<br>every accomplishment, in the command of the army! Making Karna our<br>commander, we shall crush our foes. This Karna is endued with great<br>might; he is a hero, accomplished in weapons, and incapable of defeat in<br>battle. Irresistible as Yama himself, he is quite competent to vanquish<br>our foes in battle!" Hearing these words from the preceptor's son, O<br>king, at that time, built great hopes on Karna. Cherishing the hope in<br>his heart that after the fall of Bhishma and Drona, Karna would vanquish<br>the Pandavas, and comforted (by it), O Bharata, Duryodhana then, filled<br>with joy at having heard those words of Ashvatthama, steadying his mind<br>and relying on the might of his arms, said unto Radha's son, O monarch,<br>these words that were fraught with affection and regard, and that were<br>true, delightful, and beneficial to himself: "O Karna, I know thy<br>prowess, and the great friendship thou bearest to me! For all that, O<br>mighty-armed one, I shall address the certain words that are for my good!<br>Having heard them, O hero, do that which may appear desirable to thee!<br>Thou art endued with great wisdom, and thou art even my supreme refuge!<br>Those two Atirathas that were my Generals, viz., Bhishma and Drona, have<br>been slain. Be thou my General, thou that art mightier than they! Both of<br>those great bowmen were advanced in years. They were, besides, partial to<br>Dhananjaya. Still both those heroes were respected by me, O son of Radha,<br>at thy word! Viewing his relationship of grandsire unto them, the sons of<br>Pandu, O sire, were spared in dreadful battle by Bhishma for ten<br>successive days! Thyself also having laid aside thy weapons, the valiant<br>Bhishma was slain in great battle by Phalguni with Shikhandi before him!<br>After that great bowman had fallen and betaken himself to his bed of<br>arrows, it was at thy word, O tiger among men, that Drona was made our<br>leader! By him also were the sons of Pritha spared, in consequence, as I<br>think, of their relationship unto him of pupils. That old man also has<br>been slain by Dhrishtadyumna more speedily. I do not see, even on<br>reflection, another warrior equal to thee in battle,&#8212;thee, that is,<br>whose prowess could not be measured by even those two foremost of<br>warriors that have been slain in the fight! Without doubt, thou alone<br>today art competent to win victory for us! Before, in the middle, and<br>later on, thou hast accordingly acted for our good. Therefore, like a<br>leader, it behoveth thee, in this battle, to bear the burden thyself.<br>Thyself install thy own self in the Generalship. Like the celestial<br>generalissimo, the lord Skanda of unfading prowess, (supporting the<br>celestial army), do thou support this Dhartarashtra host! Like Mahendra<br>slaying the Danavas, destroy thou all the throngs of our foes! Beholding<br>thee staying in battle, the Pandavas, those mighty car-warriors, will,<br>with the Pancalas, fly away from battle, like the Danavas at sight of<br>Vishnu. Do thou, therefore lead this vast force! When thou shalt stand<br>resolved on the field, the Pandavas of wicked hearts, the Pancalas, and<br>the Srinjayas, will all fly away with their friends. As the risen Sun,<br>scorching everything by his energy, destroyeth the thick gloom, even so<br>do thou destroy our foes!'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Strong became that hope, O king, in the heart of thy<br>son, viz., that where Bhishma and Drona had been slain, Karna would<br>vanquish the Pandavas. Cherishing that hope within his heart, he said<br>unto Karna, "O Suta's son, Partha never wishes to fight, standing before<br>thee!" Karna said, "I have, O son of Gandhari, said before in thy<br>presence, even these words, vanquish all the Pandavas with their sons and<br>Janardana!' I shall become thy General. In this there is no doubt.<br>Tranquilise thyself, O monarch I Consider the Pandavas to be already<br>vanquished!'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed, O monarch, king Duryodhana then<br>stood up with all the monarchs, like He of a hundred sacrifices with the<br>gods, for honouring Karna with the command of the army, like the<br>celestials for honouring Skanda. Then, O monarch, all the kings headed by<br>Duryodhana, desirous of victory, installed Karna in the command,<br>according to the rites enjoined by the ordinance. With golden and earthen<br>jars filled to the brim with water and sanctified with mantras, with<br>tusks of elephants and horns of rhinoceroses and mighty bulls, with other<br>vessels decked with jewels and gems, with also fragrant herbs and plants,<br>and with other articles collected in abundance, Karna, seated at his ease<br>on a seat made of udumvara wood and overlaid with silken cloth, was<br>invested with the command, according to the rites in the scriptures.<br>Brahmanas, kshatriyas, vaishyas, and respectable shudras, praised that<br>high-souled one after he was bathed on that excellent seat. Thus<br>installed in the command, O king, that slayer of foes, the son of Radha,<br>caused, by presents of Niskas and kine and other wealth, many foremost of<br>brahmanas to utter blessings on him. "Vanquish the Parthas with Govinda<br>and all their followers," even these were the words that the eulogists<br>and the brahmanas said (unto him), O bull among men! (And they also said)<br>"Slay the Parthas and the Pancalas, O son of Radha, for our victory, like<br>risen Sun ever destroying Darkness with his fierce rays! The son of Pandu<br>with Keshava are not able to even look at the shafts shot by thee, like<br>owls unable to gaze at the burning rays of the Sun! The Parthas with the<br>Pancalas are incapable of standing before thee armed with weapons, like<br>the danavas before Indra in battle!" Installed in the command, Radha's<br>son of incomparable splendour looked resplendent in beauty and radiance<br>like a second Sun. Having installed the son of Radha (thus) in the<br>command of the army, thy son, urged on by Death, regarded himself as one<br>who had his purpose accomplished. That chastiser of foes, Karna, also, O<br>king, having obtained the command, ordered the troops to be arrayed, at<br>the rise of the Sun. Surrounded by thy sons, O Bharata, Karna looked<br>resplendent like Skanda surrounded by the celestials, in the battle<br>having Saraka for its evil root.'"
