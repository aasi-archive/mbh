                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'It seems that Arjuna slew all of you at his will.<br>Indeed, the Destroyer himself could not escape him in battle, if Arjuna<br>took up arms against Him. Single-handed, Partha ravished Bhadra, and<br>single-handed, he gratified Agni. Single-handed, he subjugated the whole<br>Earth, and made all the kings pay tribute. Single-handed, with his<br>celestial bow he slew the Nivatakavachas. Single-handed, he contended in<br>battle with Mahadeva who stood before him in the guise of a hunter.<br>Single-handed, he protected the Bharatas, and single-handed, he gratified<br>Bhava. Single-handed, were vanquished by him all the kings of the Earth<br>endued with fierce prowess. The Kurus cannot be blamed. On the other<br>hand, they deserve praise (for having fought with such a warrior). Tell<br>me now what they did. Tell me also, O Suta, what Duryodhana did after<br>that.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Struck and wounded and overthrown from their vehicles and<br>divested of armour and deprived of weapons and their beasts slain, with<br>plaintive voices and burning with grief and vanquished by their foes, the<br>vain Kauravas, entering their tents once more took counsel of one<br>another. They then looked like snakes deprived of fangs and poison trod<br>upon by others. Unto them, Karna, sighing like an angry snake, squeezing<br>his hands, and eyeing thy son, said, "Arjuna is always careful, firm,<br>possessed of skill, and endued with intelligence. Again, when the time<br>comes, Vasudeva awakes him (to what should be done). Today, by that<br>sudden shower of weapons we were deceived by him. Tomorrow, however, O<br>lord of Earth, I will frustrate all his purposes." Thus addressed by<br>Karna, Duryodhana said, "So be it," and then granted permission to those<br>foremost of kings to retire. Bidden by the king, all those rulers<br>proceeded to their respective tents. Having passed the night happily,<br>they cheerfully went out for battle (the next day). They then beheld an<br>invincible array formed by king Yudhishthira the just, that foremost one<br>of Kuru race, with great care, and according to the sanction of<br>Brihaspati and Usanas. Then that slayer of foes, Duryodhana, called to<br>mind the heroic Karna, that counteractor of foes, that warrior with neck<br>like that of a bull, equal to Purandara himself in battle, the Maruts in<br>might, and Kartavirya in energy. Indeed, the heart of the king turned<br>towards Karna. And the hearts of all the troops also turned to that hero,<br>that Suta's son, that mighty bowman, as one's heart turns to a friend in<br>a situation of great danger.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'What did Duryodhana next do, O Suta, when the<br>hearts of all of you turned towards Vikarna's son Karna? Did my troops<br>cast their eyes on Radha's son like persons afflicted with cold turning<br>their gaze towards the Sun? Upon the recommencement of the battle after<br>the withdrawal of the troops, how, O Sanjaya, did Vikarna's son Karna<br>fight? How also did all the Pandavas fight with the Suta's son? The<br>mighty-armed Karna would, single-handed, slay the Parthas with the<br>Srinjayas. The might of Karna's arms in battle equals that of Sakra or<br>Vishnu. His weapons are fierce, and the prowess also of that high-souled<br>one is fierce. Relying upon Karna, king Duryodhana had set his heart on<br>battle. Beholding Duryodhana deeply afflicted by the son of Pandu, and<br>seeing also the sons of Pandu displaying great prowess, what did that<br>mighty car-warrior, viz., Karna, do? Alas, the foolish Duryodhana,<br>relying on Karna, hopeth to vanquish the Parthas with their sons and<br>Keshava in battle! Alas, it is a matter of great grief that Karna could<br>not, with his strength, overcome the sons of Pandu in fight! Without<br>doubt, Destiny is supreme. Alas, the terrible end of that gambling match<br>hath now come! Alas, these heartrending sorrows, due to Duryodhana's<br>acts, many in number and like unto terrible darts, are now being borne<br>by, me, O Sanjaya! O sire, Subala's son used to be then regarded as a<br>politic person. Karna also is always exceedingly attached to king<br>Duryodhana. Alas, when such is the case, O Sanjaya, why have I then to<br>hear of the frequent defeats and deaths of my sons? There is no one that<br>can resist the Pandavas in battle. They penetrate into my army like a man<br>into the midst of helpless women. Destiny, indeed, is supreme.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'O king, think now of all those wrongful acts of thine<br>like that match at dice and the others&#8212;acts that have passed away from<br>the subjects of thought with man. One should not, however, reflect on<br>bygone acts. One may be ruined by such reflection. That result (which<br>thou hadst expected) is now much removed from the point of fruition,<br>since, although possessed of knowledge, thou didst not reflect on the<br>propriety or impropriety of thy acts then. Many a time wert thou, O king,<br>counselled against warring with the Pandavas. Thou didst not, however, O<br>monarch, accept those counsels, from folly. Diverse sinful acts of a<br>grave nature were perpetrated by thee against the sons of Pandu. For<br>those acts this awful slaughter of kings hath now come. All that,<br>however, is now past. Do not grieve, O bull of Bharata's race. O thou of<br>unfading glory, listen now to the details of the awful carnage that has<br>occurred.<br><br>"'When the night dawned, Karna repaired to king Duryodhana. Approaching<br>the king, the mighty-armed hero said, "I shall, O king, engage in battle<br>today the illustrious son of Pandu. Either I will slay that hero today,<br>or he will slay me. In consequence of the diverse things both myself and<br>Partha had to do, O Bharata, an encounter, O king, could not hitherto<br>take place between myself and Arjuna! Listen now, O monarch, to these<br>words of mine, spoken according to my wisdom. Without slaying Partha in<br>battle I will not come back, O Bharata. Since this army of ours hath been<br>deprived of its foremost warriors, and since I will stand in battle,<br>Partha will advance against me, especially because I am destitute of the<br>dart Sakra gave me. Therefore, O ruler of men, listen now to what is<br>beneficial. The energy of my celestial weapons is equal to the energy of<br>Arjuna's weapons. In counteracting the feats of powerful foes, in<br>lightness of hands, in range of the arrows shot, in skill, and in hitting<br>the mark, Savyasaci is never my equal. In physical strength, in courage,<br>in knowledge of (weapons), in prowess, O Bharata, in aiming, Savyasaci is<br>never my equal. My bow, called Vijaya, is the foremost of all weapons (of<br>its kind). Desirous of doing what was agreeable (to Indra), it was made<br>by Vishakarman (the celestial artificer) for Indra. With that bow, O<br>king, Indra had vanquished the Daityas. At its twang the Daityas beheld<br>the ten points to be empty. That bow, respected by all, Sakra gave to<br>Bhrigu's son (Rama). That celestial and foremost of bows Bhrigu's son<br>gave to me. With that bow I will contend in battle with the mighty-armed<br>Arjuna, that foremost of victorious warriors, like Indra fighting with<br>the assembled Daityas. That formidable bow, the gift of Rama, is superior<br>to Gandiva. It was with that bow that the Earth was subjugated thrice<br>seven times (by Bhrigu's son). With that bow given to me by Rama I will<br>contend in battle with the son of Pandu. I will, O Duryodhana, gladden<br>thee today with thy friends, by slaying in battle that hero, viz.,<br>Arjuna, that foremost of conquerors. The whole Earth with her mountains<br>and forest and islands, without a heroic warrior (to oppose thy wish),<br>will, O king, become thine today, over which thyself with thy sons and<br>grandsons will reign supreme. Today there is nothing that is incapable of<br>being achieved by me, especially when the object is to do what is<br>agreeable to thee, even as success is incapable of being missed by an<br>ascetic zealously devoted to virtue and having his soul under control.<br>Arjuna will not be able to bear me in battle, even as a tree in contact<br>with fire is incapable of bearing that element. I must, however, declare<br>in what respect I am inferior to Arjuna. The string of his bow is<br>celestial, and the two large quivers of his are inexhaustible. His driver<br>is Govinda. I have none like him. His is that celestial and foremost of<br>bows, called Gandiva, which is irrefragible in battle. I also have that<br>excellent, celestial, and formidable bow called Vijaya. In respect of our<br>bows, therefore, O king, I am superior to Arjuna. Listen now to those<br>matters in which the heroic son of Pandu is superior to me. The holder of<br>the reins (of his steeds) is he of Dasharha's race who is adored by all<br>the worlds. His celestial car decked with gold, given unto him by Agni,<br>is impenetrable in every part, and his steeds also, O hero, are endued<br>with the speed of the mind. His celestial standard, bearing the blazing<br>Ape, is exceedingly wonderful. Again, Krishna, who is Creator of the<br>universe, protects that car. Though inferior to Arjuna in respect of<br>these things, I still desire to fight with him. This Shalya, however, the<br>ornament of assemblies, is equal to Saurin. If he becomes my driver,<br>victory will certainly be thine. Let Shalya, therefore, who is incapable<br>of being resisted by foes be the driver of my car. Let a large number of<br>carts bear my long shafts and those that are winged with vulturine<br>feathers. Let a number of foremost cars, O monarch, with excellent steeds<br>yoked unto them, always follow me, O bull of Bharata's race. By these<br>arrangements I will, as regards the qualities mentioned, be superior to<br>Arjuna. Shalya is superior to Krishna, and I am superior to Arjuna. As<br>that slayer of foes, viz., he of Dasharha's race, is acquainted with<br>horselore, even so is that mighty car-warrior, viz., Shalya acquainted<br>with horselore. There is none equal to the chief of the Madras in might<br>of arms. As there is none equal to myself in weapons, so there is none<br>equal to Shalya in knowledge of steeds. So circumstanced, I will become<br>superior to Partha. Against my car, the very gods with Vasava at their<br>head will not dare advance. All these being attended to, when I take my<br>stand on my car, I will become superior to Arjuna in the attributes of<br>warrior and will then, O best of the Kurus, vanquish Phalguna. I desire,<br>O monarch, all this to be done by thee, O scorcher of foes. Let these<br>wishes of mine be accomplished. Let no time be suffered to elapse. If all<br>this be accomplished, the most effectual aid will be rendered to me on<br>every desirable point. Thou wilt then see, O Bharata, what I will achieve<br>in battle. I will by every means vanquish the sons of Pandu in battle<br>when they will approach me. The very gods and Asuras are not able to<br>advance against me in battle. What need be said then of the sons of Pandu<br>that are of human origin?'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed by that ornament of battle, viz.,<br>Karna, thy son, worshipping the son of Radha, answered him, with a glad<br>heart, saying, "Accomplish that, O Karna, which thou thinkest. Equipped<br>with goodly quivers and steeds, such cars shall follow thee in battle.<br>Let as many cars as thou wishest bear thy long shafts and arrows equipped<br>with vulturine feathers. Ourselves, as also all the kings, O Karna will,<br>follow thee in battle.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Having said these words, thy royal son, endued with<br>great prowess, approached the ruler of the Madras and addressed him in<br>the following words.'"
