                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the troops crushed with arrows in that<br>encounter between Karna and Arjuna, Shalya proceeded, filled with wrath,<br>on that car divested of equipment. Beholding his army deprived of the<br>Suta's son and its cars and steeds and elephants destroyed, Duryodhana,<br>with eyes bathed in tears, repeatedly sighed the very picture of woe.<br>Desirous of beholding the heroic Karna, pierced with arrows and bathed in<br>blood, and stretched on the earth like the sun dropped from the skies at<br>will, the warriors came there and stood surrounding the fallen hero.<br>Amongst those belonging to the enemy and thy army that thus stood there,<br>some showed signs of joy, some of fear, some of sorrow, some of wonder,<br>and some gave themselves up to great grief, according to their respective<br>natures. Others amongst the Kauravas, hearing that Karna of mighty energy<br>had been slain by Dhananjaya, his armour, ornaments, robes, and weapons<br>having all been displaced, fled in fear like a herd of kine afflicted<br>with exceeding fear at losing its bull. Bhima then, uttering loud roars<br>and causing the welkin to tremble with those awful and tremendous shouts,<br>began to slap his armpits, jump, and dance, frightening the<br>Dhartarashtras by those movements. The Somakas and the Srinjayas also<br>loudly blew their conchs. All the Kshatriyas embraced one another in joy,<br>upon beholding the Suta's son slain at that juncture. Having fought a<br>dreadful battle, Karna was slain by Arjuna like an elephant by a lion.<br>That bull among men, Arjuna, thus accomplished his vow. Indeed even thus,<br>Partha reached the end of his hostility (towards Karna). The ruler of the<br>Madras, with stupefied heart, quickly proceeding, O king, to the side of<br>Duryodhana, on that car divested of standard said in sorrow these words,<br>"The elephants, the steeds, and the foremost of car-warriors of thy army<br>have been slain. In consequence of those mighty warriors, and steeds, and<br>elephants huge as hills, having been slain after coming into contact with<br>one another, thy host looks like the domains of Yama. Never before, O<br>Bharata, has a battle been fought like that between Karna and Arjuna<br>today. Karna had powerfully assailed the two Krishnas today and all<br>others who are thy foes. Destiny, however, has certainly flowed,<br>controlled by Partha. It is for this that Destiny is protecting the<br>Pandavas and weakening us. Many are the heroes who, resolved to<br>accomplish thy objects have been forcibly slain by the enemy. Brave<br>kings, who in energy, courage, and might, were equal to Kuvera or Yama or<br>Vasava or the Lord of the waters, who were possessed of every merit, who<br>were almost unslayable, and who were desirous of achieving thy object,<br>have in battle been slain by the Pandavas. Do not, O Bharata, grieve for<br>this. This is Destiny. Comfort thyself. Success cannot be always<br>attained." Hearing these words of the ruler of the Madras and reflecting<br>on his own evil doings. Duryodhana, with a cheerless heart, became almost<br>deprived of his senses and sighed repeatedly the very picture of woe.'"
