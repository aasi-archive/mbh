                            "Sanjaya said, 'During the progress of that battle in which so many<br>Kshatriyas sank down, the loud twang of Gandiva, O sire, was heard above<br>the din on that spot, O king, where the son of Pandu was engaged in<br>slaughtering the samsaptakas, the Kosalas, and the Narayana forces.<br>Filled with rage and longing for victory, the samsaptakas, in that<br>battle, began to pour showers of arrows on Arjuna's head. The puissant<br>Partha, however, quickly checking those arrowy showers, O king, plunged<br>into that battle, and began to slay many foremost of car-warriors.<br>Plunging into the midst of that division of cars with the aid of his<br>whetted shafts equipped with Kanka feathers, Partha came upon Susharma of<br>excellent weapons. That foremost of car-warriors poured on Arjuna thick<br>showers of arrows. Meanwhile the samsaptakas also covered Partha with<br>their shafts. Then Susharma, piercing Partha with ten shafts, struck<br>Janardana with three in the right arm. With a broad-headed arrow then, O<br>sire, he pierced the standard of Arjuna. Thereupon that foremost of apes,<br>of huge dimensions, the handiwork of the celestial artificer himself,<br>began to utter loud sounds and roared very fiercely, affrighting thy<br>troops. Hearing the roars of the ape, thy army became inspired with fear.<br>Indeed, under the influence of a great fear, that army became perfectly<br>inactive. That army then, as it stood inactive, O king, looked beautiful<br>like the Citraratha forest with its flowery burthen of diverse kinds.<br>Then those warriors, recovering their senses, O chief of the Kurus, began<br>to drench Arjuna with their arrowy downpours like the clouds drenching<br>the mountains. Then all of them encompassed the great car of the Pandava.<br>Assailing him, they uttered loud roars although all the while they were<br>being struck and slaughtered with sharp shafts. Assailing his steeds, his<br>car-wheels, his car-shaft, and every other limb of his vehicle, with<br>great force, O sire, they uttered many leonine roars. Some among them<br>seized the massive arms of Keshava, and some among them, O king, seized<br>Partha himself with great joy as he stood on his car. Then Keshava,<br>shaking his arms on the field of battle, threw down all those that had<br>seized them, like a wicked elephant shaking down all the riders from his<br>back. Then Partha, encompassed by those great car-warriors, and beholding<br>his car assailed and Keshava attacked in that manner became filled with<br>rage, and overthrew a large number of car-warriors and foot-soldiers. And<br>he covered all the combatants that were close to him with many arrows,<br>that were fit for close encounters. Addressing Keshava then, he said,<br>"Behold, O Krishna, O thou of mighty arms, these countless samsaptakas<br>engaged in accomplishing a fearful task although slaughtered in<br>thousands. O bull amongst the Yadus, there is none on Earth, save myself,<br>that would be able to bear such a close attack on his car." Having said<br>these words, Vibhatsu blew his conch. Then Krishna also blew his conch<br>filling the welkin with its blare. Hearing that blare the army of the<br>samsaptakas began to waver, O king, and became inspired with great<br>fright. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son of Pandu,<br>paralysed the legs of the samsaptakas by repeatedly invoking, O monarch,<br>the weapon called Naga. Thus tied with those foot-tying bands by the<br>high-souled son of Pandu, all of them stood motionless, O king, as if<br>they had been petrified. The son of Pandu then began to slay those<br>motionless warriors like Indra in days of yore slaying the Daityas in the<br>battle with Taraka. Thus slaughtered in that battle, they set the car<br>free, and commenced to throw down all their weapons. Their legs being<br>paralysed, they could not, O king, move a step. Then Partha slew them<br>with his straight arrows. Indeed, all these warriors in that battle,<br>aiming at whom Partha had invoked that foot-tying weapon, had their lower<br>limbs encircled with snakes. Then the mighty car-warrior Susharma, O<br>monarch, beholding his army thus paralysed, quickly invoked the weapon<br>called Sauparna. Thereupon numerous birds began to come down and devour<br>those snakes. The latter again, at the sight of rangers of the sky,<br>began, O king, to fly away. Freed from that foot-tying weapon, the<br>Samsaptaka force, O monarch, looked like the Sun himself giving light<br>unto all creatures, when freed from clouds. Thus liberated, those<br>warriors once more shot their arrows, O sire, and hurled their weapons at<br>Arjuna's car. And all of them pierced Partha with numerous weapons.<br>Cutting off with his own arrowy downpour that shower of mighty weapons<br>Vasava's son, that slayer of hostile heroes, began to slaughter those<br>warriors. Then Susharma, O king, with a straight arrow, pierced Arjuna in<br>the chest, and then he pierced him with three other shafts. Deeply<br>pierced therewith, and feeling great pain, Arjuna sat down on the terrace<br>of his car. Then all the troops loudly cried out, saying, "Partha is<br>slain." At this the blare of conchs, and the peal of drums, and the sound<br>of diverse musical instruments, and loud leonine shouts, arose there.<br>Recovering his senses, Partha of immeasurable soul, owning white steeds<br>and having Krishna for his driver, speedily invoked the Aindra weapon.<br>Then thousands of arrows, O sire, issuing from that weapon, were seen on<br>all sides to slay kings and elephants. And steeds and warriors, in<br>hundreds and thousands, were also seen to be slaughtered in that battle,<br>with these weapons. Then while the troops were thus being slaughtered, a<br>great fear entered the hearts of all the samsaptakas and Gopalas, O<br>Bharata. There was no man amongst them that could fight with Arjuna.<br>There in the very sight of all the heroes, Arjuna began to destroy thy<br>troops. Beholding that slaughter, all of them remained perfectly<br>inactive, without putting forth their prowess. Then the son of Pandu<br>having slain full 10,000 combatants in that battle, looked resplendent, O<br>monarch, like a blazing fire without smoke. And then he slew full 14,000<br>warriors, and 3,000 warriors, and 3,000 elephants. Then the samsaptakas<br>once more encompassed Dhananjaya, making death or victory their goal. The<br>battle then that took place there between thy warriors and that mighty<br>hero, viz., the diadem-decked son of Pandu became awful.'"
