                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'When the two armies, duly arrayed, thus mingled<br>with each other for battle, O Sanjaya, how did Partha assail the<br>samsaptakas, and how Karna assail the Pandavas? Tell me the incidents of<br>the battle in detail, for thou art skilled in narration. Listening to the<br>accounts of the prowess of heroes in battle, I am never satiated.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Observing the vast hostile force stationed in that<br>manner, Arjuna arrayed his troops in proper form, in consequence of the<br>evil policy of thy son. The vast Pandava force then, teeming with<br>horsemen and elephants and foot-soldiers and cars, and headed by<br>Dhrishtadyumna, looked exceedingly magnificent. With his steeds white as<br>pigeons, the son of Prishata, equal in splendour to the Sun or the Moon,<br>armed with bow, looked resplendent like Death himself in embodied form.<br>The sons of Draupadi, desirous of battle, stood by the side of the son of<br>Prishata. They were clad in excellent coats of mail, and armed with<br>excellent weapons, and all of them were endued with the prowess of<br>tigers. Possessed of effulgent bodies, they followed their maternal uncle<br>like the stars appearing with the Moon. Beholding the samsaptakas<br>standing in array, Arjuna, with wrath excited, rushed against them,<br>drawing his bow Gandiva. The samsaptakas then, desirous of slaying<br>Arjuna, rushed against Partha, firmly resolved on victory, and making<br>death their goal. That brave host of heroes, teeming with men, steeds,<br>infuriate elephants, and cars, began very quickly to afflict Arjuna.<br>Their encounter with Kiritin (Arjuna) became exceedingly furious. That<br>encounter resembled the one that took place between Arjuna and the<br>Nivatakavachas, as we have heard. Partha cut off cars and steeds and<br>standards and elephants and foot-soldiers engaged in fight, with shafts<br>and bows and swords and discs and battle axes, and uplifted arms with<br>weapons in grasp, and the heads also of foes, by thousands upon<br>thousands. The samsaptakas, regarding the car of Partha sunk in that deep<br>vortex of warriors, uttered loud roars. Partha, however, slaying all his<br>foes in front, slew those that stood further off, and then those that<br>were on his right and his back, like Rudra himself in rage slaughtering<br>all created things endued with life. The encounter that took place when<br>the Pancalas, the Cedis, and the Srinjayas faced thy troops was<br>exceedingly fierce. Kripa and Kritavarma, and Shakuni the son of Subala,<br>those heroes difficult of defeat in battle, accompanied by troops that<br>were all cheerful, themselves filled with rage, and capable of smiting<br>down thick ranks of cars, fought with the Koshalas, the Kasis, the<br>Matsyas, the Karusas, the Kaikayas, and the Surasenas, all of whom were<br>possessed of great courage. That battle fraught with great slaughter and<br>destructive of body, life and sins, became conducive to fame, heaven, and<br>virtue, in respect of the Kshatriya, the Vaishya, and the Shudra heroes<br>that were engaged in it. Meanwhile the Kuru king Duryodhana with his<br>brothers, O bull of Bharata's race, and supported by many Kuru heroes and<br>many mighty Madraka car-warriors, protected Karna while the latter was<br>engaged in battle with the Pandavas, the Pancalas, the Cedis, and<br>Satyaki. Destroying that vast division with his sharp arrows, and<br>crushing many foremost of car-warriors Karna succeeded in afflicting<br>Yudhishthira. Cutting off the armour, the weapons, and the bodies of<br>thousands of foes and slaying his foes by thousands and sending them to<br>heaven and making them earn great fame, Karna caused his friends great<br>joy. Thus, O sire, that battle destructive of men, steeds, and cars,<br>between the Kurus and the Srinjayas, resembled the battle between the<br>gods and the Asuras of old.'"
