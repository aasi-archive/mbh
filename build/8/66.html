                            "'Yudhishthira said, "Welcome, O thou that hast Devaki for thy mother,<br>and welcome to thee, O Dhananjaya! The sight of both of you, O Acyuta and<br>Arjuna, is exceedingly agreeable! I see that without being wounded<br>yourselves, you two, his foes, have slain the mighty car-warrior Karna!<br>He was in battle like unto a snake of virulent poison. He was<br>accomplished in all weapons. The leader of all the Dhartarashtras, he was<br>their armour and protector! While fighting he was always protected by<br>Vrishasena and by Sushena, both of whom are great bowmen! Of great<br>energy, he had received lessons from Rama in weapons! He was invincible<br>in battle! The foremost one in all the world, as a car-warrior he was<br>celebrated throughout all the worlds. He was the saviour of the<br>Dhartarashtras, and the proceeder in their van! A slayer of hostile<br>troops, he was the crusher of large bands of foes. Ever engaged in<br>Duryodhana's good, he was always prepared to inflict woe on us! He was<br>invincible in battle by the very gods with Vasava at their head. In<br>energy and might he was equal unto the god of fire and the god of wind.<br>In gravity he was unfathomable as the Nether world. The enhancer of the<br>joys of friends, he was like the Destroyer himself unto foes! Having<br>slain Karna (who was even so) in dreadful battle, by good luck it is that<br>you two have come, like a couple of celestials after vanquishing an<br>Asura! Today, O Acyuta and Arjuna, a great battle was fought between<br>myself exerting with might and that hero resembling the Destroyer<br>himself, while seeking to exterminate all creatures! My standard was cut<br>down, and my two Parshni drivers also were slain by him. I was also made<br>steedless and carless by him in the very sight of Yuyudhana, of<br>Dhrishtadyumna, of the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva), of the heroic<br>Shikhandi, as also in the very sight of the sons of Draupadi, and all the<br>Pancalas! Having vanquished those innumerable foes, Karna of mighty<br>energy then vanquished me, O thou of mighty arms, although I exerted<br>myself resolutely in battle! Pursuing me then and without doubt,<br>vanquishing all my protectors, that foremost of warriors addressed me in<br>diverse harsh speeches. That I am still alive, O Dhananjaya, is due to<br>the prowess of Bhimasena. What more need I say? I am unable to bear that<br>humiliation! For thirteen years, O Dhananjaya, through fear of Karna, I<br>did not obtain any sleep by night or any comfort by day! Filled with<br>hatred of Karna, I burn, O Dhananjaya! Like the bird Vaddhrinasa I fled<br>from Karna, knowing that the time for my own destruction had come. The<br>whole of my time had passed in the thought as to how I would accomplish<br>the destruction of Karna in battle! Awake or asleep, O son of Kunti, I<br>always beheld Karna (with my mind's eye). Wherever I was, the universe<br>appeared to me to be full of Karna! Inspired with the fear of Karna,<br>wherever I used to go, O Dhananjaya, thither I beheld Karna standing<br>before my eyes! Vanquished in battle, with my steeds and car, by that<br>hero who never retreated from battle, alive I was let off by him! What<br>use have I of life or of kingdom either, since Karna, that ornament of<br>battle, today cried fie on me? That which I had never before met with at<br>the hands of Bhishma or Kripa or Drona in battle, that I met with today<br>at the hands of the Suta's son, that mighty car-warrior! It is for this,<br>O son of Kunti, that I ask thee today about thy welfare! Tell me in<br>detail how thou hast slain Karna today! In battle Karna was equal unto<br>Sakra himself. In prowess he was equal unto Yama. In weapons he was equal<br>unto Rama. How then hath he been slain? He was regarded as a mighty<br>car-warrior, conversant with all modes of warfare. He was the foremost of<br>all bowmen, and the one man amongst all men! O prince, the son of Radha<br>was always worshipped by Dhritarashtra and his son, for thy sake! How<br>then hath he been slain by thee? In all engagements, Dhritarashtra's son,<br>O Arjuna, used to regard Karna as thy death, O bull among men! How then,<br>O tiger among men, hath that Karna been slain by thee in battle? Tell me,<br>O son of Kunti, how that Karna hath been slain by thee! How, while he was<br>engaged in battle, didst thou, O tiger among men, strike off his head in<br>the very sight of all his friends like a tiger tearing off the head of a<br>ruru deer? That Suta's son who in battle searched all the points of the<br>compass for finding thee, that Karna who had promised to give a car with<br>six bulls of elephantine proportions unto him that would point thee out,<br>I ask: doth that Karna of wicked soul lie today on the bare ground, slain<br>with thy keen arrows equipped with kanka feathers? Having slain the<br>Suta's son in battle, thou hast accomplished a deed highly agreeable to<br>me! Encountering him in battle, hast thou really slain that Suta's son,<br>who, filled with arrogance and pride and bragging of his heroism, used to<br>search everywhere on the field of battle for thee? Hast thou, O sire,<br>really slain in battle that sinful wretch who used to always challenge<br>thee and who was desirous for thy sake of giving unto others a<br>magnificent car, made of gold along with a number of elephants and bulls<br>and steeds? Hast thou really slain today that sinful wight who was<br>exceedingly dear to Suyodhana, and who, intoxicated with pride of<br>heroism, used always to brag in the assembly of the Kurus? Encountered in<br>battle, doth that wretch lie today on the field, his limbs exceedingly<br>mangled with sky-ranging shafts sped by thee from thy bow and all steeped<br>in blood? Have the two arms of Dhritarashtra's son been (at last) broken?<br>Have those words been unfulfilled, uttered from folly by him who, filled<br>with pride, used to always boast in the midst of the kings for gladdening<br>Duryodhana, saying, 'I will slay Phalguna'? O son of Indra, hath that<br>Karna of little understanding been slain by thee today, that Suta's son<br>who made the vow that he would not wash his feet as long as Partha lived?<br>That Karna of wicked understanding who in the assembly; before the Kuru<br>chiefs, had addressed Krishna, saying, 'Why, O Krishna, dost thou not<br>abandon the Pandavas that are divested of might, exceedingly weak, and<br>fallen?' That Karna who had vowed for thy sake, saying that he would not<br>return from battle without having slain Krishna and Partha. I ask, doth<br>that Karna of sinful understanding lie today on the field, his body<br>pierced with shafts? Thou knowest the nature of the battle that took<br>place when the Srinjayas and the Kauravas encountered each other, the<br>battle in which I was brought to that distressful plight. Encountering<br>that Karna, hast thou slain him today? O Savyasaci, hast thou today, with<br>blazing shafts sped from gandiva, cut off from the trunk of that Karna of<br>wicked understanding his resplendent head decked with earrings? Pierced<br>with Karna's shafts today, I had, O hero, thought of thee (that thou<br>wouldst slay him)! Hast thou then, by the slaughter of Karna, made that<br>thought of mine true? In consequence of the protection granted him by<br>Karna, Suyodhana, filled with pride, always recked us little. Displaying<br>thy prowess, hast then today destroyed that refuge of Suyodhana? That<br>Suta's son of wicked soul, that Karna of great wrath, who had formerly,<br>in the presence of the Kauravas and in the midst of the assembly called<br>us sesame seeds without kernel, encountering that Karna in battle, hast<br>thou slain him today? That Suta's son of wicked soul who had, laughing<br>the while, commanded Duhshasana to forcibly drag Yajnasena's daughter won<br>in gambling by Subala's son, hath he been slain today by thee? That Karna<br>of little understanding who, having been counted as only half a<br>car-warrior during the tale of rathas and atirathas, had upbraided that<br>foremost of all wielders of weapons on Earth, our grandsire Bhishma, hath<br>he been slain by thee? Extinguish, O Phalguna, this fire in my heart that<br>is born of vindictiveness and is fanned by the wind of humiliation, by<br>telling me that thou hast slain Karna today, having encountered him in<br>battle! The news of Karna's slaughter is exceedingly agreeable to me.<br>Tell me, therefore, how the Suta's son hath been slain! Like the divine<br>Vishnu waiting for the arrival of Indra with the intelligence of Vritra's<br>slaughter, I had so long waited for thee, O hero!"'"
