                            "Sanjaya said 'After Karna, gladdening thy army, had set out for battle,<br>he spoke unto every Pandava soldier that he met with, even these words:<br>"Unto him that will today point out the high-souled Dhananjaya of white<br>steeds to me, I will give whatever wealth he desires. If having got it he<br>does not become satisfied, I shall in addition, give him,&#8212;him that is,<br>that will discover Arjuna to me, a cart-load of jewels and gems. If that<br>does not satisfy the person who discovers Arjuna to me, I will give him a<br>century of kine with as many vessels of brass for milking those animals.<br>I will give a hundred foremost of villages unto the person that discovers<br>Arjuna to me. I will also give him that shows Arjuna to me a number of<br>long-tressed damsels of black eyes and a car unto which shall be yoked<br>white mules. If that does not satisfy the person that discovers Arjuna to<br>me, I shall give him another foremost of cars, made of gold, and having<br>six bulls yoked unto it that shall be as large as elephants. I shall also<br>give unto him a hundred damsels decked with ornaments, with collars of<br>gold, fair-complexioned and accomplished in singing and dancing. If that<br>does not satisfy the person that discovers Arjuna to me, I shall give him<br>a 100 elephants, a 100 villages and a 100 cars, and 10,000 steeds of the<br>foremost of breed, fat, docile, endued with many excellent qualities,<br>capable of dragging cars and well-trained. I shall also give to the<br>person that discovers Arjuna to me four hundred kine, each with golden<br>horns and her calf. If that does not satisfy the person that discovers<br>Arjuna to me, I shall make him a more valuable gift, viz., five hundred<br>steeds, adorned with trappings of gold and decked with jewelled<br>ornaments. I shall also give eighteen other steeds of great docility. I<br>shall also give the person that discovers Arjuna to me a bright car made<br>of gold and adorned with diverse ornaments and having foremost of Kamboja<br>steeds yoked unto it. If that does not satisfy the person that discovers<br>Arjuna to me, I shall make him a more valuable gift, viz., six hundred<br>elephants, with chains of gold around their necks, and covered with<br>housings of gold, born in the western shores of the ocean, and trained by<br>elephant trainers. If that does not satisfy the person that discovers<br>Arjuna to me, I shall make him a more valuable gift, viz., fourteen<br>Vaishya villages, teeming with people, full of wealth, situated in the<br>proximity of forests and rivers, free from all sorts of danger, well<br>furnished (with other necessaries), and worthy of being enjoyed by kings.<br>To him that will discover Dhananjaya to me, I shall also give a hundred<br>female slaves, with golden collars, belonging to the country of the<br>Magadhas, and of very youthful age. If that does not satisfy the person<br>that discovers Arjuna to me, I will make him a more valuable gift, that,<br>indeed, which he himself will solicit. Sons, wives and articles of<br>pleasure and enjoyment that I have, these all I shall give him if he<br>desires them. Indeed, unto him who discovers Keshava and Arjuna to me, I<br>shall, after slaying those two, give all the wealth that may be left by<br>them." Having uttered those diverse speeches in that battle, Karna blew<br>his excellent conch, sea-born and producing a sweet blare. Hearing these<br>words of Suta's son that were suitable to his disposition, Duryodhana, O<br>king, with all his followers became filled with joy. At that juncture the<br>beat of cymbals and drums and leonine shouts, and grunts of elephants<br>with the sounds of diverse musical instruments, arose there, O king,<br>among the (Kaurava) troops, O bull among men. The shouts also of warriors<br>filled with joy arose there. When the (Kaurava) troops were thus filled<br>with joy, the ruler of the Madras, laughing in scorn, said these words<br>unto that grinder of foes, viz., the son of Radha, that mighty<br>car-warrior who was about to plunge into that ocean of battle and who was<br>indulging in such vain bragging.'"
