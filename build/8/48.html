                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Tell me, O Sanjaya, how Karna, having caused a<br>great slaughter penetrated into the midst of the Pandava troops, and<br>struck and afflicted king Yudhishthira. Who were those foremost of heroes<br>among the Parthas that resisted Karna? Who were they whom Karna crushed<br>before he could succeed in afflicting Yudhishthira?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the Parthas headed by Dhrishtadyumna stationed<br>for battle, that crusher of foes, viz., Karna, rushed impetuously against<br>the Pancalas. Like swans rushing towards the sea, the Pancalas, longing<br>for victory, rushed as quickly against that high-souled warrior advancing<br>to the encounter. Then the blare of thousands of conchs, as if piercing<br>the heart by its shrillness, arose from both hosts, and the fierce peal<br>also of thousands of drums. The sound also of diverse musical instruments<br>and the noise made by elephants and steeds and cars, and the leonine<br>shouts of heroes, that arose there, became exceedingly awful. It seemed<br>that the whole Earth with her mountains and trees and oceans, the entire<br>welkin covered with wind-tossed clouds, and the whole firmament with the<br>Sun, the Moon, and the stars, trembled with that sound. All creatures<br>regarded that noise to be even such and became agitated. Those amongst<br>them that were endued with little strength fell dead. Then Karna, excited<br>with great wrath, quickly invoking his weapons, began to smite the<br>Pandava army like Maghavat smiting the army of the Asuras. Penetrating<br>then into the Pandava host and shooting his arrows, Karna slew seven and<br>seventy foremost of warriors among the Prabhadrakas. Then that foremost<br>of car-warriors, with five and twenty sharp shafts equipped with goodly<br>wings, slew five and twenty Pancalas. With many cloth-yard shafts<br>equipped with wings of gold and capable of piercing the bodies of all<br>foes, that hero slew the Cedis by hundreds and thousands. While he was<br>employed in achieving those superhuman feats in battle, large throngs of<br>Pancala cars, O king, quickly surrounded him on all sides. Aiming then, O<br>Bharata, five irresistible shafts, Karna, otherwise called Vaikartana or<br>Vrisha, slew five Pancala warriors. The five Pancalas, O Bharata, that he<br>slew in that battle were Bhanudeva and Citrasena and Senavindu and Tapana<br>and Surasena. While the Pancala heroes were thus being slaughtered with<br>arrows in that great battle, loud cries of "Oh" and "Alas" arose from<br>among the Pancala host. Then ten car-warriors among the Pancalas, O<br>monarch, surrounded Karna. Them, too, Karna speedily slew with his<br>shafts. The two protectors of Karna's car wheels, viz., his two<br>invincible sons, O sire, that were named Sushena and Satyasena, began to<br>fight, reckless of their very lives. The eldest son of Karna, viz., the<br>mighty car-warrior Vrishasena, himself protected his father's rear. Then<br>Dhrishtadyumna, Satyaki, and the five sons of Draupadi, and Vrikodara,<br>Janamejaya, and Shikhandi, and many foremost warriors among the<br>Prabhadrakas, and many amongst the Cedis, the Kaikayas, and the Pancalas,<br>the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva), and the Matsyas, all clad in mail,<br>rushed fiercely upon Radha's son, skilled in smiting, from desire of<br>slaying him. Pouring upon him diverse kinds of weapons and thick showers<br>of arrows, they began to afflict him like the clouds afflicting the<br>mountain breast in the season of rains. Desirous of rescuing their<br>father, the sons of Karna, all of whom were effectual smiters, and many<br>other heroes, O king, of thy army, resisted those (Pandava) heroes.<br>Sushena, cutting off with a broad-headed arrow the bow of Bhimasena,<br>pierced Bhima himself with seven cloth-yard shafts in the chest, and<br>uttered a loud roar. Then Vrikodara of terrible prowess, taking up<br>another tough bow and stringing it quickly, cut off Sushena's bow.<br>Excited with rage and as if dancing (on his car), he quickly pierced<br>Sushena himself with ten arrows, and then pierced Karna, within the<br>twinkling of an eye, with seventy sharp shafts. With ten other shafts,<br>Bhima then felled Bhanusena, another son of Karna, with his steeds,<br>driver, weapons, and standard, in the very sight of the latter's friends.<br>The sightly head of that youth, graced with a face as beautiful as the<br>Moon, cut off with a razor-headed arrow, looked like a lotus plucked from<br>its stalk. Having slain Karna's son, Bhima began to afflict thy troops<br>once more. Cutting off the bows then of Kripa and Hridika's son, he began<br>to afflict those two also. Piercing Duhshasana with three arrows made<br>wholly of iron, and Shakuni with six, he deprived both Uluka and his<br>brother Patatri of their cars. Addressing Sushena next in these words,<br>viz., "Thou art slain." Bhima took up an arrow. Karna, however, cut off<br>that arrow and struck Bhima himself with three shafts. Then Bhima took up<br>another straight arrow of great impetuosity and sped it at Sushena. But<br>Vrisha cut that arrow also. Then Karna, desirous of rescuing his son, and<br>wishing to make an end of the cruel Bhimasena, struck the latter with<br>three and seventy fierce arrows. Then Sushena taking up an excellent bow<br>capable of bearing a great strain, pierced Nakula with five arrows in the<br>arms and the chest. Nakula, then piercing his antagonist with twenty<br>strong shafts capable of bearing a great strain, uttered a loud roar and<br>inspired Karna with fright. The mighty car-warrior Sushena, however, O<br>king, piercing Nakula with ten shafts, quickly cut off the latter's bow<br>with a razor-headed arrow. Then Nakula, insensate with rage, took up<br>another bow, and resisted Sushena in that battle with nine shafts. That<br>slayer of hostile heroes, O king, shrouding all the quarters with showers<br>of arrows, slew Sushena's driver, and piercing Sushena himself again with<br>three shafts, and then with three other broad-headed arrows, cut off his<br>bow of great strength into three fragments. Sushena also, deprived of his<br>senses in rage, took up another bow and pierced Nakula with sixty arrows<br>and Sahadeva with seven. The battle raged fiercely, like that of the gods<br>and the Asuras between those heroes striking one another. Satyaki,<br>slaying the driver of Vrishasena with three arrows, cut off the latter's<br>bow with a broad-headed shaft and struck his steeds with seven arrows.<br>Crushing his standard then with another arrow, he struck Vrishasena<br>himself with three arrows in the chest. Thus struck, Vrishasena became<br>senseless on his car, but within the twinkling of an eye, stood up again.<br>Deprived of his driver and steeds and car standard by Yuyudhana<br>(Satyaki), Vrishasena then, armed with sword and shield, rushed against<br>Yuyudhana from desire of slaying him. Satyaki, however, as his antagonist<br>rushed towards him, struck at his sword and shield with ten arrows<br>equipped with heads like a boar's ear. Then Duhshasana, beholding<br>Vrishasena made carless and weaponless, quickly caused him to ascend his<br>own car, and bearing him away from the spot, caused him to ride another<br>vehicle. The mighty car-warrior Vrishasena then, riding on another<br>vehicle, pierced the five sons of Draupadi with seventy and Yuyudhana<br>with five, and Bhimasena with four and sixty, and Sahadeva with five, and<br>Nakula with thirty, and Satanika with seven arrows, and Shikhandi with<br>ten, and king Yudhishthira with a hundred. These and many other foremost<br>of heroes, O king, all inspired with desire of victory that great bowman,<br>viz., the son of Karna, O monarch, continued to afflict with his shafts.<br>Then, in that battle, the invincible Vrishasena continued to protect the<br>rear of Karna. The grandson of Sini, having made Duhshasana driverless<br>and steedless and carless by means of nine times nine arrows made wholly<br>of iron, struck Duhshasana with ten shafts in the forehead. The Kuru<br>prince then, riding on another car that was duly equipped (with all<br>necessary implements), once more began to fight with the Pandavas, from<br>within the division of Karna. Then Dhristadyumna pierced Karna with ten<br>arrows, and the sons of Draupadi pierced him with three and seventy, and<br>Yuyudhana with seven. And Bhimasena pierced him with four and sixty<br>arrows, and Sahadeva with seven. And Nakula pierced him with thirty<br>arrows, and Satanika with seven. And the heroic Shikhandi pierced him<br>with ten and king Yudhishthira with a hundred. These and other foremost<br>of men, O monarch, all inspired with desire of victory, began to grind<br>that great bowman, viz., the Suta's son, in that dreadful battle. That<br>chastiser of foes, viz., the Suta's son of great heroism, performing<br>quick evolutions with his car, pierced every one of those warriors with<br>ten arrows. We then, O king, witnessed the lightness of hand displayed by<br>the high-souled Karna and the power of his weapons. Indeed, what we saw<br>appeared to be highly wonderful. People could not notice when he took up<br>his arrows, when he aimed them, and when he let them off. They only<br>beheld his enemies dying fast in consequence of his wrath. The sky, the<br>firmament, the Earth, and all the quarters seemed to be entirely shrouded<br>with sharp arrows. The firmament looked resplendent as if covered with<br>red clouds. The valiant son of Radha, armed with the bow, and as if<br>dancing (on his car), pierced each of his assailants with thrice as many<br>arrows as each of them had pierced him with. And once more piercing each<br>of them, and his steeds, driver, car, and standard with ten arrows, he<br>uttered a loud roar. His assailants then gave him a way (through which he<br>passed out). Having crushed those mighty bowmen with showers of arrows,<br>the son of Radha, that crusher of foes, then penetrated, unresisted, into<br>the midst of the division commanded by the Pandava king. Having destroyed<br>thirty cars of the unreturning Cedis, the son of Radha struck<br>Yudhishthira with many sharp arrows. Then many Pandava warriors, O king,<br>with Shikhandi and Satyaki, desirous of rescuing the king from the son of<br>Radha, surrounded the former. Similarly all the brave and mighty bowmen<br>of thy army resolutely protected the irresistible Karna in that battle.<br>The noise of diverse musical instrument arose then, O king, and the<br>leonine shouts of brave warriors rent the sky. And the Kurus and the<br>Pandavas once more fearlessly encountered each other, the former headed<br>by the Suta's son and the latter by Yudhishthira.'"
