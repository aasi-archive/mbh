                            "Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile the son of Drona (Ashvatthama), beholding<br>Yudhishthira protected by the grandson of Sini (Satyaki) and by the<br>heroic sons of Draupadi, cheerfully advanced against the king, scattering<br>many fierce arrows equipped with wings of gold and whetted on stone, and<br>displaying diverse manoeuvres of his car and the great skill he had<br>acquired and his exceeding lightness of hands. He filled the entire<br>welkin with shafts inspired with the force of celestial weapons.<br>Conversant with all weapons, Drona's son encompassed Yudhishthira in that<br>battle. The welkin being covered with the shafts of Drona's son, nothing<br>could be seen. The vast space in front of Ashvatthama became one expanse<br>of arrows. The welkin then, thus covered with that dense shower of arrows<br>decked with gold, looked beautiful, O chief of the Bharatas, as if a<br>canopy embroidered with gold had been spread there. Indeed, the<br>firmament, O king, having been covered with that bright shower of arrows,<br>a shadow, as that of the clouds, appeared there on the occasion.<br>Wonderful was the sight that we then beheld when the sky had thus become<br>one expanse of arrows, for not one creature ranging the sky could course<br>through his element. Then Satyaki, though struggling resolutely, and<br>Pandu's son king Yudhishthira the just, as also all the other warriors,<br>could not display their prowess. Beholding the great lightness of hands<br>displayed by the son of Drona, the mighty car-warriors (of the Pandava<br>army) were filled with wonder. All the kings became incapable of even<br>looking at Ashvatthama, O monarch, who then resembled the scorching Sun<br>himself in the sky. While the Pandava troops were thus being slaughtered,<br>those mighty car-warriors, viz., the sons of Draupadi, and Satyaki, and<br>king Yudhishthira the just, and the Pancala warriors, all uniting<br>together, cast off their fears of death and rushed against the son of<br>Drona. Then Satyaki, piercing the son of Drona with seventy arrows, once<br>more pierced him with seven long shafts decked with gold. And<br>Yudhishthira pierced him with three and seventy arrows, and Prativindya<br>with seven, and Srutakarman pierced him with three arrows and Srutakirti<br>with five. And Sutasoma pierced him with nine arrows, and Satanika with<br>seven. And many other heroes pierced him with many arrows from every<br>side. Filled then with rage and breathing, O king, like a snake of<br>virulent poison, Drona's son pierced Satyaki in return with five and<br>twenty arrows whetted on stone. And he pierced Srutakirti with nine<br>arrows and Sutasoma with five, and with eight arrows he pierced<br>Srutakarman, and Prativindya with three. And he pierced Satanika with<br>nine arrows, and Dharma's son (Yudhishthira) with five. And each of the<br>other warriors he pierced with a couple of shafts. With some keen arrows<br>he then cut off the bow of Srutakirti. The latter then, that great<br>car-warrior, taking up another bow, pierced Drona's son, first with three<br>arrows and then with many others equipped with sharp points. Then, O<br>monarch, the son of Drona covered the Pandava troops, O sire, with thick<br>showers of arrows, O bull of Bharata's race. Of immeasurable soul, the<br>son of Drona, next smiling the while, cut off the bow of king<br>Yudhishthira the just, and then pierced him with three arrows. The son of<br>Dharma then, O king, taking up another formidable bow, pierced Drona's<br>son with seventy arrows in the arms and the chest. Then Satyaki, filled<br>with rage in that battle, cut off the bow of Drona's son, that great<br>smiter, with a sharp crescent-shaped arrow and uttered a loud roar. His<br>bow cut off, that foremost of mighty men viz., the son of Drona, quickly<br>felled Satyaki's driver from his car with a dart. The valiant son of<br>Drona then, taking up another bow, covered the grandson of Sini, O<br>Bharata, with a shower of arrows. His driver having been slain, Satyaki's<br>steeds were seen to run hither and thither, O Bharata, in that battle.<br>Then the Pandava warriors headed by Yudhishthira, shooting sharp shafts,<br>all rushed with impetuosity towards Drona's son, that foremost of all<br>wielders of weapons. That scorcher of foes, however, viz., the son of<br>Drona, beholding those warriors wrathfully advancing against him received<br>them all in that dreadful battle. Then like a fire in the forest<br>consuming heaps of dry grass and straw, that mighty car-warrior, viz.,<br>Drona's son, having showers of arrows for his flames, consumed the<br>Pandava troops in that battle, who resembled a heap of dry grass and<br>straw. That army of Pandu's son, thus scorched by the son of Drona,<br>became exceedingly agitated, O chief of the Bharatas, like the mouth of a<br>river by a whale. People then, O monarch, beholding the prowess of<br>Drona's son, regarded all the Pandavas as already slain by him. Then<br>Yudhishthira, that great car-warrior and disciple of Drona, filled with<br>rage and the desire to retaliate, addressed Drona's son, saying "O tiger<br>among men, thou hast no affection, thou hast no gratitude, since thou<br>desirest to slay me today. The duties of a Brahmana are asceticism and<br>gift and study. The bow should be bent by the Kshatriya only. It seems,<br>therefore, that thou art a Brahmana in name only. In thy very sight,<br>however. O thou of mighty arms, I will vanquish the Kauravas in battle.<br>Do what thou canst in battle. I tell thee that thou art a wretch amongst<br>Brahmanas." Thus addressed, the son of Drona. smiling, and reflecting<br>upon what was proper and true, gave no reply. Without saying anything, he<br>covered the son of Pandu in that battle with a shower of arrows like the<br>destroyer himself in wrath while engaged in annihilating creatures. Thus<br>covered by Drona's son. O sire, the son of Pritha quickly went away from<br>that spot, leaving that large division of his. After Yudhishthira, the<br>son of Dharma, had gone away, the high-souled son of Drona also, O king,<br>left that spot. Then Yudhishthira, O king, avoiding the son of Drona in<br>that great battle proceeded against thy army, resolved to achieve the<br>cruel task of slaughter.'"
