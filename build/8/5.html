                            Vaishampayana said, "Hearing these words, O monarch, Ambika's son<br>Dhritarashtra, with heart agitated by grief, addressed his driver<br>Sanjaya, saying, 'Though the evil policy, O sire, of my son of little<br>foresight, Vikartana's son hath been slain! This intelligence is cutting<br>the very core of my heart! I am desirous of crossing this sea of grief!<br>Remove my doubts, therefore, by telling me who are still alive and who<br>are dead amongst the Kurus and the Pandavas!'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Endued with great prowess and invincible in battle,<br>Bhishma the son of Shantanu, O king, having slain large numbers of<br>Srinjayas and Pancalas, hath been slain after ten days. The mighty and<br>invincible bowman Drona of the golden car, having slaughtered the Pancala<br>divisions in battle, hath been slain. Having slaughtered the half of what<br>remained after the carnage by Bhishma and the illustrious Drona,<br>Vikartana's son Karna hath been slain. Endued with great strength, O<br>monarch, prince Vivingsati, having slain hundreds of Anarta warriors in<br>battle, hath been slain. Thy heroic son Vikarna, deprived of steeds and<br>weapons, stood, facing the foe, remembering the duties of Kshatriyas.<br>Remembering the many foul wrongs inflicted upon him by Duryodhana, and<br>bearing in mind his own vow, Bhimasena hath slain him. Possessed of great<br>might, Vinda and Anuvinda, the two princes of Avanti, after achieving the<br>most difficult feats, have gone to Yama's abode. That hero who had under<br>his sway ten kingdoms, having Sindhu for their chief, him who was ever<br>obedient to thee, Jayadratha of mighty energy, O king, Arjuna hath slain<br>after vanquishing eleven akshauhinis of troops with his keen arrows.<br>Endued with great activity and incapable of being easily defeated in<br>battle, the son of Duryodhana, ever obedient to his sire's commands, hath<br>been slain by the son of Subhadra. The brave son of Duhshasana, possessed<br>of mighty arms and fierce in battle, hath been despatched to Yama's abode<br>by Draupadi's son exerting himself with great prowess! The ruler of the<br>Kiratas and other dwellers of the lowlands on the seacoast, the much<br>respected and dear friend of the chief of the celestials himself, the<br>virtuous king Bhagadatta, who was ever devoted to Kshatriya duties, hath<br>been despatched to Yama's abode by Dhananjaya exerting himself great with<br>prowess.

Sudakshina, O king,<br>who had many thousands of wonderful elephants, hath been slain in battle<br>by Arjuna. The ruler of the Kosolas, having slain many hundreds of foes,<br>hath himself been despatched to Yama's abode by Subhadra's son exerting<br>himself with prowess. Having fought with many thousands of foes and with<br>the mighty car-warrior Bhimasena himself, thy son Citrasena hath been<br>slain by Bhimasena. The brave younger brother of the ruler of the Madras,<br>that enhancer of the fears of foes, that handsome warrior armed with<br>sword and shield, hath been slain by Subhadra's son. He who was equal to<br>Karna himself in battle, Karna's son Vrishasena, accomplished in arms, of<br>mighty energy and steady prowess, hath, in the very sight of Karna, been<br>despatched to Yama's abode by Dhananjaya who put forth his prowess<br>remembering the slaughter of his own son Abhimanyu and bearing in mind<br>the vow he had made. That lord of Earth, Srutayus, who always displayed a<br>deep-rooted antipathy towards the Pandavas, hath been slain by Partha who<br>reminded him of that antipathy before taking his life. Shalya's son of<br>great prowess, O sire, Rukmaratha, hath, O king, been slain in battle by<br>Sahadeva although the former happened to be the latter's brother, having<br>been the son of the latter's maternal uncle. The old king Bhagiratha, and<br>Vrihatkshatra the ruler of the Kaikeyas both endued with great prowess<br>and might and energy, have been slain. Bhagadatta's son, O king who was<br>possessed of great wisdom and great strength, hath been slain by Nakula<br>who always careers in battle with the activity of the hawk. Thy grandsire<br>Bahlika, possessed of great might and prowess, hath, with all his<br>followers, been slain by Bhimasena. The mighty Jayatsena the son of<br>Jarasandha, the prince of the Magadhas, O king, hath been slain in battle<br>by the high-souled son of Subhadra. Thy son Durmukha, O king, as also thy<br>other son Dussaha, that mighty car-warrior, both of whom were regarded as<br>heroes, have been slain by Bhimasena with his mace. Durmarshana and<br>Durvisaha and the mighty car-warrior Durjaya, having achieved the most<br>difficult feats, have gone to Yama's abode. The two brothers Kalinga and<br>Vrishaka, who were invincible in battle, having achieved very difficult<br>feats have gone to Yama's abode. Thy counsellor Vrishavarman of the Suta<br>caste, endued with great energy, hath been despatched to Yama's abode by<br>Bhimasena exerting himself with prowess. So also king Paurava who was<br>endued with the might of 10,000 elephants, hath, with all his followers,<br>been slain by Pandu's son Arjuna. The Vasatis, O king, numbering 2,000,<br>effectual smiters of all, as also the Surasenas endued with prowess, have<br>all been slain in battle. The Abhishahas, clad in mail, capable of<br>smiting effectually, and fierce in battle, also the Sivis, those foremost<br>of car-warriors, with the Kalingas, have all been slain. Those other<br>heroes also, (the Narayana Gopas) who live and grew in Gokula, who were<br>exceedingly wrathful in battle, and who never retreated from the field<br>have been slain by Savyasaci. Many thousands of Srenis, as also the<br>samsaptakas, approaching Arjuna, have all repaired to the abode of Yama.<br>Thy two brothers-in-law, viz., the princes Vrishaka and Achala, who were<br>endued with great prowess, have for thy sake been slain by Savyasaci.<br>King Shalva of mighty arms and fierce deeds, who was a great bowman both<br>in name and feats, hath been slain by Bhimasena. Oghavat, O king, and<br>Vrishanta, fighting together in battle and exerting themselves with great<br>vigour for the sake of their ally, have both repaired to Yama's abode. So<br>also that foremost of car-warriors, viz., Kshemadhurti, O monarch, hath<br>been slain in battle by Bhimasena with his mace. So also that great<br>bowman, viz., the mighty king Jalasandha, after causing an immense<br>carnage, hath been slain by Satyaki in battle. That prince of Rakshasas,<br>viz., Alayudha, unto whose vehicle were yoked asses (of monstrous shape)<br>hath been despatched to Yama's abode by Ghatotkaca exerting himself with<br>great prowess. Radha's son of the Suta caste, and those mighty<br>car-warriors who were his brothers, and the Kaikeyas, the Malavas, the<br>Madrakas the Dravidas of fierce prowess, the Yaudheyas, the Lalittyas,<br>the Kshudrakas, the Usinaras, the Tundikeras, the Savitriputras, the<br>Easterners, the Northerners, the Westerners, and the Southerners, O sire,<br>have all been slain by Savyasaci. Large bands of foot-soldiers, myriads<br>upon myriads of steeds, large number of car-warriors, and many huge<br>elephants, have been slain. Many heroes also, with standards and weapons,<br>and with armour and attire and ornaments, and endued with perseverance<br>and possessed of high birth and good conduct, have been slain in battle<br>by Partha who is never fatigued with exertion. Others, endued with<br>immeasurable might, and desirous of slaying their foes, (have met with a<br>similar fate). These and many other kings, numbering thousands, with<br>their followers, have, O monarch, been slain in battle. That which thou<br>askest me I am answering now. Even thus did the destruction take place<br>when Arjuna and Karna fought. Even as Mahendra slew Vritra, and Rama slew<br>Ravana; even as Krishna slew Naraka or Mura in battle; even as the mighty<br>Rama of Bhrigu's race slew the heroic Kartavirya, invincible in battle,<br>with all his kinsmen and friends, after fighting a terrible battle<br>celebrated through the three worlds; even as Skanda slew (the Asura)<br>Mahisha, and Rudra slew (the Asura) Andhaka, even so hath Arjuna, O king,<br>in single combat, slain, with all his kinsmen, that foremost of smiters,<br>viz., Karna, who was invincible in battle and upon whom the<br>Dhartarashtras had placed their hopes of victory, and who was the great<br>cause of the hostility with the Pandavas! Pandu's son hath now<br>accomplished that which at one time thou couldst not believe him capable<br>of accomplishing, although, O monarch, well-meaning friends failed not to<br>apprise thee of it. That calamity, fraught with great destruction, hath<br>now come! Thou, O king wishing them well, hast heaped those evils on the<br>heads of thy covetous sons! The fruit of those evils is now manifesting<br>itself!'"
