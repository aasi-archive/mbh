                            "Sanjaya said, 'Having vanquished the son of Drona and achieved a mighty<br>and heroic feat that is exceedingly difficult of accomplishment,<br>Dhananjaya, irresistible by foes, and with bow outstretched in his hands,<br>cast his eyes among his own troops. The brave Savyasaci, gladdening those<br>warriors of his that were still battling at the head of their divisions<br>and applauding those among them that were celebrated for their former<br>achievements, caused the carwarriors of his own army to continue to stand<br>in their posts. Not seeing his brother Yudhishthira of Ajamida's race,<br>the diadem-decked Arjuna, adorned, besides, with a necklace of gold,<br>speedily approached Bhima and enquired of him the whereabouts of the<br>king, saying, "Tell me, where is the king?" Thus asked, Bhima said, "King<br>Yudhishthira the just, hath gone away from this place, his limbs scorched<br>with Karna's shafts. It is doubtful whether he still liveth!" Hearing<br>those words, Arjuna said, "For this reason go thou quickly from the spot<br>for bringing intelligence of the king, that best of all the descendants<br>of Kuru! Without doubt, deeply pierced by Karna with shafts, the king<br>hath gone to the camp! In that fierce passage at arms, though deeply<br>pierced by Drona with keen shafts, the king endued with great activity,<br>had still stayed in battle, expectant of victory, until Drona was slain!<br>That foremost one among the Pandavas, possessed of great magnanimity, was<br>greatly imperilled by Karna in today's battle! For ascertaining his<br>condition, quickly go hence, O Bhima! I will stay here, checking all our<br>foes!" Thus addressed, Bhima said, "O thou of great glory, go thyself for<br>ascertaining the condition of the king, that bull amongst the Bharatas!<br>If, O Arjuna, I go there, many foremost of heroes will then say that I am<br>frightened in battle!" Then Arjuna said unto Bhimasena, "The samsaptakas<br>are before my division! Without slaying those assembled foes first, it is<br>impossible for me to stir from this place!' Then Bhimasena said unto<br>Arjuna, 'Relying upon my own might, O foremost one among the Kurus, I<br>will fight with all the samsaptakas in battle! Therefore, O Dhananjaya,<br>do thou go thyself!'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing in the midst of foes, those words of his<br>brother Bhimasena that were difficult of accomplishment, Arjuna, desiring<br>to see the king, addressed the Vrishni hero, saying, "Urge the steeds, O<br>Hrishikesha, leaving this sea of troops! I desire, O Keshava to see king<br>Ajatasatru!'"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Just as he was on the point of urging the steeds,<br>Keshava, that foremost one of the Dasharhas, addressed Bhima, saying,<br>"This feat is not at all wonderful for thee, O Bhima! I am about to go<br>(hence). Slay these assembled foes of Partha!" Then Hrishikesha proceeded<br>with very great speed to the spot where king Yudhishthira was, O king,<br>borne by those steeds that resembled Garuda, having stationed Bhima, that<br>chastiser of foes, at the head of the army and having commanded him, O<br>monarch, to fight (with the samsaptakas). Then those two foremost of men,<br>(Krishna and Arjuna), proceeding on their car, approached the king who<br>was lying alone on his bed. Both of them, alighting from that car,<br>worshipped the feet of king Yudhishthira the just. Beholding that bull of<br>tigers among men safe and sound, the two Krishnas became filled with joy,<br>like the twin Ashvinis on seeing Vasava. The king then congratulated them<br>both like Vivasvat congratulating the twin Ashvinis, or like Brihaspati<br>congratulating Sankara and Vishnu after the slaughter of the mighty asura<br>Jambha. King Yudhishthira the just, thinking that Karna had been slain,<br>became filled with joy, and that scorcher of foes thereupon addressed<br>them in these words in a voice choked with delight.'"
