                            "Sanjaya said, 'Thus addressed by Janardana, Pritha's son Arjuna,<br>applauding those counsels of his friend, then vehemently addressed king<br>Yudhishthira the just, in language that was harsh and the like of which<br>he had never used before.<br><br>"'Arjuna said, "Do thou not, O king, address these upbraidings to me,<br>thou that art passing thy time full two miles away from battle. Bhima,<br>however, who is battling with the foremost heroes of the world may<br>upbraid me. Having afflicted his foes at the proper time in battle, and<br>slain many brave lords of earth and many foremost of car-warriors and<br>huge elephants and many heroic horsemen and countless brave combatants,<br>he hath, in addition, slain a 1,000 elephants and 10,000 Kamboja<br>mountaineers, and is uttering loud roars in battle like a lion after<br>slaying innumerable smaller animals. That hero achieveth the most<br>difficult feats, the like of which thou canst never achieve. Jumping down<br>from his car, mace in hand, he hath destroyed a large number of steeds<br>and cars and elephants in battle. With also his foremost of swords he<br>hath destroyed many horsemen and cars and steeds and elephants. With the<br>broken limbs of cars, and with his bow also, he consumeth his foes.<br>Endued with the prowess of Indra, with his feet and also his bare arms he<br>slayeth numerous foes. Possessed of great might and resembling Kuvera and<br>Yama, he destroyeth the hostile army, putting forth his strength. That<br>Bhimasena hath the right to upbraid me, but not thou that art always<br>protected by friends. Agitating the foremost of car-warriors and<br>elephants and steeds and foot-soldiers, Bhima, single-handed, is now in<br>the midst of the Dhartarashtras. That chastiser of foes hath the right to<br>upbraid me. The chastiser of foes who is slaying the Kalingas, the<br>Vangas, the Angas, the Nishadas, and the Magadhas, and large numbers of<br>hostile elephants that are ever infuriated and that look like masses of<br>blue clouds, is competent to upbraid me. Riding on a suitable car,<br>shaking his bow at the proper time, and with shafts in his (other) hand,<br>that hero poureth showers of arrows in great battle like the clouds<br>pouring torrents of rain. Eight hundred elephants, I have seen, with<br>their frontal globes split open and the ends of their tusks cut off, have<br>today been slain by Bhima with shafts in battle. That slayer of foes is<br>competent to tell me harsh words. The learned say that the strength of<br>the foremost of Brahmanas lies in speech, and that the Kshatriya's<br>strength is in his arms. Thou, O Bharata, art strong in words and very<br>unfeeling. Thou thinkest me to be like thyself. I always strive to do<br>thee good with my soul, life, sons and wives. Since, not withstanding all<br>this, thou still piercest me with such wordy darts, it is evident that we<br>cannot expect any happiness from thee. Lying on Draupadi's bed thou<br>insultest me, though for thy sake I slay the mightiest of car-warriors.<br>Thou art without any anxiety, O Bharata, and thou art cruel. I have never<br>obtained any happiness from thee. It was for thy good, O chief of men,<br>that Bhishma, firmly devoted to truth, himself told thee the means of his<br>death in battle, and was slain by the heroic and high-souled Shikhandi,<br>the son of Drupada, protected by me. I do not derive any pleasure from<br>the thought of thy restoration to sovereignty, since thou art addicted to<br>the evil practice of gambling. Having thyself committed a wicked act to<br>which they only are addicted that are low, thou desirest now to vanquish<br>thy foes through our aid. Thou hadst heard of the numerous faults and the<br>great sinfulness of dice that Sahadeva spoke about. Yet dice, which are<br>worshipped by the wicked, thou couldst not abandon. It was for this that<br>all of us have fallen into hell. We have never derived any happiness from<br>thee since thou wert engaged in gambling with dice. Having, O son of<br>Pandu, thyself caused all this calamity, thou art, again, addressing<br>these harsh words to me. Slain by us, hostile troops are lying on the<br>field, with mangled bodies and uttering loud wails. It was thou that<br>didst that cruel act in consequence of which the Kauravas have become<br>offenders and are being destroyed. Nations from the North, the West, the<br>East, and the South, are being struck, wounded and slain, after the<br>performance of incomparable feats in battle by great warriors of both<br>sides. It was thou that hadst gambled. It was for thee that we lost our<br>kingdom. Our calamity arose from thee, O king! Striking us, again, with<br>the cruel goad of thy speeches, O king, do not provoke our wrath.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Having addressed these harsh and exceedingly bitter words<br>unto his eldest brother and thereby committed a venial sin, the<br>intelligent Savyasaci of calm wisdom, who is ever actuated by the fear of<br>defection from virtue, became very cheerless. The son of the chief of the<br>celestials became filled with remorse and breathing heavily, drew his<br>sword. Seeing this, Krishna asked him, "What is this? Why dost thou again<br>unsheathe thy sword blue as the sky? Tell me what thy answer is, for then<br>I shall give thee counsel for the gratification of thy object." Thus<br>addressed by that foremost of men, Arjuna, in great sorrow answered<br>Keshava, saying, "I shall, putting forth my strength, slay my own self by<br>whom this wicked act hath been done." Hearing those words of Partha,<br>Keshava, that foremost of all righteous persons said this unto<br>Dhananjaya, "Having said these words unto the king, why hast thou become<br>so cheerless? O slayer of foes, thou desirest now to destroy thy own<br>self. This, however, Kiritin, is not approved by the righteous. If, O<br>hero among men, thou hadst today, from fear of sin, slain this thy eldest<br>brother of virtuous soul, what would then have been thy condition and<br>what wouldst thou not then have done? Morality is subtle, O Bharata, and<br>unknowable, especially by those that are ignorant. Listen to me as I<br>preach to thee. By destroying thy own self, thou wouldst sink into a more<br>terrible hell than if thou hadst slain thy brother. Declare now, in<br>words, thy own merit. Thou shalt then, O Partha, have slain thy own<br>self." Applauding these words and saying, "Let it be so, O Krishna,"<br>Dhananjaya, the son of Sakra, lowering his bow, said unto Yudhishthira,<br>that foremost of virtuous persons, "Listen, O king, there is no other<br>bowman, O ruler of men, like unto myself, except the deity that bears<br>Pinaka; I am regarded by even that illustrious deity. In a moment I can<br>destroy this universe of mobile and immobile creatures. It was I, O king,<br>that vanquished all the points of the compass with all the kings ruling<br>there, and brought all to thy subjection. The Rajasuya (performed by<br>thee), brought to completion by gift of Dakshina, and the celestial<br>palace owned by thee, were both due to my prowess. In my hands are (marks<br>of) sharp shafts and a stringed bow with arrow fixed thereon. On both my<br>soles are the signs of cars with standards. No one can vanquish a person<br>like me in battle. Nations from the North, the West, the East and the<br>South, have been struck down, slain, exterminated and destroyed. A small<br>remnant only of the samsaptakas is alive. I alone have slain half of the<br>entire (hostile) army. Slaughtered by me, the Bharata host that<br>resembled, O king, the very host of the celestials, is lying dead on the<br>field. I slay those with (high) weapons that are conversant with high<br>weapons. For this reason I do not reduce the three worlds to ashes.<br>Riding upon my terrible and victorious car, Krishna and myself will soon<br>proceed for slaying the Suta's son. Let this king become cheerful now. I<br>will surely slay Karna in battle, with my arrows. Either the Suta dame<br>will today be made childless by me, or Kunti will be made childless by<br>Karna. Truly do I say it that I will not put off my armour before I have<br>slain Karna with my arrows in battle.'"<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Having said these words unto that foremost of virtuous<br>persons, viz., Yudhishthira, Partha threw down his weapons and cast aside<br>his bow and quickly thrust his sword back into its sheath. Hanging down<br>his head in shame, the diadem-decked Arjuna, with joined hands, addressed<br>Yudhishthira, and said, "Be cheerful, O king, forgiving me. What I have<br>said, you will understand a little while after. I bow to thee." Thus<br>seeking to cheer that royal hero capable of bearing all foes, Arjuna,<br>that foremost of men, standing there, once more said, "This task will not<br>be delayed. It will be accomplished soon. Karna cometh towards me. I<br>shall proceed against him. I shall, with my whole soul, proceed for<br>rescuing Bhima from the battle and for slaying the Suta's son. I tell<br>thee that I hold my life for thy good. Know this for the truth, O king."<br>Having said so, the diadem-decked Arjuna of blazing splendour touched the<br>king's feet and rose for proceeding to the field. Hearing, however, those<br>harsh words of his brother Phalguna, Pandu's son, king Yudhishthira, the<br>just, rising up from that bed (on which he had been sitting), said these<br>words unto Partha, with his heart filled with sorrow, "O Partha, I have<br>acted wickedly. For that, ye have been overwhelmed with terrible<br>calamity. Do thou strike off, therefore, this my head today. I am the<br>worst of men, and the exterminator of my race. I am a wretch. I am<br>addicted to wicked courses. I am of foolish understanding. I am idle and<br>a coward. I am an insulter of the old. I am cruel. What wouldst thou gain<br>by always being obedient to a cruel person like me? A wretch that I am, I<br>shall this very day retire into the woods. Live you happily without me.<br>The high-souled Bhimasena is fit to be king. A eunuch that I am, what<br>shall I do with sovereignty? I am incapable of bearing these harsh<br>speeches of thee excited with wrath. Let Bhima become king. Having been<br>insulted thus, O hero, what use have I with life." Having said these<br>words, the king, leaving that bed, suddenly stood up and desired to go to<br>the woods. Then Vasudeva, bowing down, said unto him, "O king, the<br>celebrated vow of the wielder of Gandiva who is ever devoted to truth<br>about his Gandiva, is known to thee. That man in the world who would tell<br>him, 'Give thy Gandiva to another', would be slain by him. Even those<br>very words were addressed to him by you. Therefore, for keeping that<br>earnest vow, Partha, acting also at my instance, inflicted you this<br>insult, O lord of Earth. Insult to superiors is said to be their death.<br>For this reason, O thou of mighty arms, it behoveth thee to forgive me<br>that beseech and bow to thee this transgression, O king, of both myself<br>and Arjuna, committed for maintaining the truth. Both of us, O great<br>king, throw ourselves on thy mercy. The Earth shall today drink the blood<br>of the wretched son of Radha. I swear truly to thee. Know the Suta's son<br>as slain today. He, whose slaughter thou desirest, hath today lost his<br>life." Hearing those words of Krishna, king Yudhishthira the just, in a<br>great fury, raised the prostrate Hrishikesha and joining his hands, said<br>in haste, "It is even so as thou hast said. I have been guilty of a<br>transgression, I have now been awakened by thee, O Govinda. I am saved by<br>thee, O Madhava. By thee, O Acyuta, we have today been rescued from a<br>great calamity. Both of us stupefied by folly, viz., myself and Arjuna,<br>have been rescued from an ocean of distress, having obtained thee as our<br>lord. Indeed, having obtained the raft of thy intelligence today, we<br>have, with our relatives and allies, passed over an ocean of sorrow and<br>grief. Having obtained thee, O Acyuta, we are not masterless."'"
