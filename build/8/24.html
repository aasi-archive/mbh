                            "Sanjaya said, 'While Nakula was employed in destroying and routing the<br>Kaurava divisions in battle with great force, Vikartana's son Karna,<br>filled with rage, checked him, O king. Then Nakula smiling the while,<br>addressed Karna, and said, "After a long time, through the favour of the<br>gods, I am seen by thee, and thou also, O wretch, dost become the object<br>of my sight. Thou art the root of all these evils, this hostility, this<br>quarrel. It is through thy faults that the Kauravas are being thinned,<br>encountering one another. Slaying thee in battle today, I will regard<br>myself as one that has achieved his object, and the fever of my heart<br>will be dispelled." Thus addressed by Nakula, the Suta's son said unto<br>him the following words befitting a prince and a bowman in particular,<br>"Strike me, O hero. We desire to witness thy manliness. Having achieved<br>some feats in battle, O brave warrior, thou shouldst then boast. O sire,<br>they that are heroes fight in battle to the best of their powers, without<br>indulging in brag. Fight now with me to the best of thy might. I will<br>quell thy pride." Having said these words the Suta's son quickly struck<br>the son of Pandu and pierced him, in that encounter, with three and<br>seventy shafts. Then Nakula, O Bharata, thus pierced by the Suta's son,<br>pierced the latter in return with eighty shafts resembling snakes of<br>virulent poison. Then Karna, that great bowman, cutting off his<br>antagonist's bow with a number of arrows winged with gold and whetted on<br>stone, afflicted him with thirty arrows. Those arrows, piercing through<br>his armour drank his blood in that battle, like the Nagas of virulent<br>poison drinking water after having pierced through the Earth. Then<br>Nakula, taking up another formidable bow whose back was decked with gold,<br>pierced Karna with twenty arrows and his driver with three. Then, O<br>monarch, that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., Nakula, filled with rage,<br>cut off Karna's bow with a razor-headed shaft of great keenness. Smiling<br>the while, the heroic son of Pandu then struck the bowless Karna, that<br>foremost of car-warriors, with three hundred arrows. Beholding Karna thus<br>afflicted, O sire, by the son of Pandu, all the carwarriors there, with<br>the gods (in the welkin), were filled with great wonder. Then Vikartana's<br>son Karna taking up another bow, struck Nakula with five arrows in the<br>shoulder-joint. With those arrows sticking to him here, the son of Madri<br>looked resplendent like the Sun with his own rays while shedding his<br>light on the Earth. Then Nakula piercing Karna with seven shafts, once<br>more, O sire, cut off one of the horns of Karna's bow. Then Karna, taking<br>up in that battle a tougher bow, filled the welkin on every side of<br>Nakula with his arrows. The mighty car-warrior, Nakula, however, thus<br>suddenly shrouded with the arrows shot from Karna's bow quickly cut off<br>all those shafts with shafts of his own. Then was seen overspread in the<br>welkin a vast number of arrows like to the spectacle presented by the sky<br>when it is filled with myriads of roving fireflies. Indeed, the sky<br>shrouded with those hundreds of arrows shot (by both the warriors)<br>looked, O monarch, as if it was covered with flights of locusts. Those<br>arrows, decked with gold, issuing repeatedly in continuous lines, looked<br>beautiful like rows of cranes while flying through the welkin. When the<br>sky was thus covered with showers of arrows and the sun himself hid from<br>the view, no creature ranging the air could descend on the Earth. When<br>all sides were thus covered with showers of arrows, those two high-souled<br>warriors looked resplendent like two Suns risen at the end of the Yuga.<br>Slaughtered with the shafts issuing from Karna's bow the Somakas, O<br>monarch, greatly afflicted and feeling much pain, began to breathe their<br>last. Similarly, thy warriors, struck with the shafts of Nakula,<br>dispersed on all sides, O king, like clouds tossed by the wind. The two<br>armies thus slaughtered by those two warriors with their mighty celestial<br>shafts, retreated from the range of those arrows and stood as spectators<br>of the encounter. When both the armies were driven off by means of the<br>shafts of Karna and Nakula, those two high-souled warriors began to<br>pierce each other with showers of shafts. Displaying their celestial<br>weapons on the field of battle, they quickly shrouded each other, each<br>desirous of compassing the destruction of the other. The shafts shot by<br>Nakula, dressed with Kanka and peacock feathers, shrouding the Suta's<br>son, seemed to stay in the welkin. Similarly, the shafts sped by the<br>Suta's son in that dreadful battle, shrouding the son of Pandu, seemed to<br>stay in the welkin. Shrouded within arrowy chambers, both the warriors<br>became invisible, like the Sun and the Moon, O king, hidden by the<br>clouds. Then Karna, filled with rage and assuming a terrible aspect in<br>the battle, covered the son of Pandu with showers of arrows from every<br>side. Completely covered, O monarch, by the Suta's son, the son of Pandu<br>felt no pain like the Maker of day when covered by the clouds. The son of<br>Adhiratha then, smiling the while, sped arrowy lines, O sire, in hundreds<br>and thousands, in that battle. With those shafts of the high-souled<br>Karna, an extensive shade seemed to rest on the field of battle. Indeed,<br>with those excellent shafts constantly issuing out (of his bow), a shade<br>was caused there like that formed by the clouds. Then Karna, O monarch,<br>cutting off the bow of the high-souled Nakula, felled the latter's driver<br>from the car-niche with the greatest ease. With four keen shafts, next,<br>he quickly despatched the four steeds of Nakula, O Bharata, to the abode<br>of Yama. With his shafts, he also cut off into minute fragments that<br>excellent car of his antagonist as also his standard and the protectors<br>of his car-wheels, and mace, and sword, and shield decked with a hundred<br>moons, and other utensils and equipments of battle. Then Nakula,<br>steedless and carless and armourless, O monarch, quickly alighting from<br>his car, stood, armed with a spiked bludgeon. Even that terrible<br>bludgeon, so uplifted by the son of Pandu, the Suta's son, O king, cut<br>off with many keen arrows capable of bearing a great strain. Beholding<br>his adversary weaponless. Karna began to strike him with many straight<br>shafts, but took care not to afflict him greatly. Thus struck in that<br>battle by that mighty warrior accomplished in weapons, Nakula, O king,<br>fled away precipitately in great affliction. Laughing repeatedly, the son<br>of Radha pursued him and placed his stringed bow, O Bharata, around the<br>neck of the retreating Nakula. With the large bow around his neck, O<br>king, the son of Pandu looked resplendent like Moon in the firmament when<br>within a circular halo of light, or a white cloud girdled round by<br>Indra's bow. Then Karna, addressing him, said, "The words thou hadst<br>uttered were futile. Canst thou utter them now once more in joy,<br>repeatedly struck as thou art by me? Do not, O son of Pandu, fight again<br>with those amongst the Kurus that are possessed of greater might. O<br>child, fight with them that are thy equals. Do not, O son of Pandu, feel<br>any shame for it. Return home, O son of Madri, or go thither where<br>Krishna and Phalguna are." Having addressed him thus he abandoned him<br>then. Acquainted with morality as the brave Karna was, he did not then<br>slay Nakula who was already within the jaws of death. Recollecting the<br>words of Kunti, O king, Karna let Nakula go. The son of Pandu, thus let<br>off, O king, by that bowman, Suta's son, proceeded towards Yudhishthira's<br>car in great shame. Scorched by the Suta's son, he then ascended his<br>brother's car, and burning with grief he continued to sigh like a snake<br>kept within a jar. Meanwhile Karna, having vanquished Nakula, quickly<br>proceeded against the Pancalas, riding on that car of his which bore many<br>gorgeous pennons and whose steeds were as white as the Moon. There, O<br>monarch, a great uproar arose among the Pandavas when they saw the leader<br>of the Kaurava army proceeding towards the Pancala car-throngs. The<br>Suta's son, O monarch, made a great massacre there at that hour when the<br>Sun had reached the meridian, that puissant warrior careering all the<br>while with the activity of a wheel. We beheld many Pancala car-warriors<br>borne away from the battle on their steedless and driverless cars with<br>broken wheels and broken axles and with standards and pennons also that<br>were broken and torn, O sire. And many elephants were seen to wander<br>there in all directions (with limbs scorched by arrows) like individuals<br>of their species in the wide forest with limbs scorched and burned in a<br>forest conflagration. Others with their frontal globes split open, or<br>bathed in blood, or with trunks lopped off, or with their armour cut<br>down, or their tails lopped off, fell down, struck by the high-souled<br>Karna, like straggling clouds. Other elephants, frightened by the shafts<br>and lances of Radha's son proceeded against Radha's son himself like<br>insects towards a blazing fire. Other huge elephants were seen striking<br>against one another and shedding blood from various limbs like mountains<br>with rillets running down their breasts. Steeds of the foremost breed,<br>divested of breast-plates and their ornaments of silver and brass and<br>gold, destitute of trappings and bridle-bits and yak-tails and<br>saddle-cloths, with quivers fallen off from their backs, and with their<br>heroic riders,&#8212;ornaments of battle,&#8212;slain, were seen wandering here and<br>there on the field. Pierced and cut with lances and scimitars and swords,<br>O Bharata, we beheld many a horseman adorned with armour and head-gear,<br>slain or in course of being slain or trembling with fear, and deprived, O<br>Bharata, of diverse limbs. Cars also, decked with gold, and unto which<br>were yoked steeds of great fleetness, were seen by us dragged with<br>exceeding speed hither and thither, their riders having been slain. Some<br>of these had their axles and poles broken, and some, O Bharata, had their<br>wheels broken; and some were without banners and standards, and some were<br>divested of their shafts. Many car-warriors also were seen there, by us,<br>O monarch, wandering all around, deprived of their cars and scorched with<br>the shafts of the Suta's son. And some destitute of weapons and some with<br>weapons still in their arms were seen lying lifeless on the field in<br>large numbers. And many elephants also were seen by us, wandering in all<br>directions, studded with clusters of stars, adorned with rows of<br>beautiful bells, and decked with variegated banners of diverse hues.<br>Heads and arms and chests and other limbs, cut off with shafts sped from<br>Karna's bow, were beheld by us lying around. A great and fierce calamity<br>overtook the warriors (of the Pandava army) as they fought with whetted<br>arrows, and mangled as they were with the shafts of Karna. The Srinjayas,<br>slaughtered in that battle by the Suta's son, blindly proceeded against<br>the latter's self like insects rushing upon a blazing fire. Indeed, as<br>that mighty car-warrior was engaged in scorching the Pandava divisions,<br>the kshatriyas avoided him, regarding him to be the blazing Yuga fire.<br>Those heroic and mighty car-warriors of the Pancala that survived the<br>slaughter fled away. The brave Karna, however, pursued those broken and<br>retreating warriors from behind, shooting his shafts at them. Endued with<br>great energy, he pursued those combatants divested of armour and<br>destitute of standards. Indeed, the Suta's son, possessed of great might,<br>continued to scorch them with his shafts, like the dispeller of darkness<br>scorching all creatures when he attains to the meridian.'"
