                            "Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile Arjuna, O monarch, having slain the four kinds<br>of forces (of the enemy), and having obtained a sight of the angry son of<br>the Suta in that dreadful battle, caused a river of blood to flow there<br>that was tawny with flesh and marrow and bones. Human heads constituted<br>its rocks and stones. Elephants and steeds formed its banks. Full of the<br>bones of heroic combatants, it resounded with the cries of ravens and<br>vultures. Umbrellas were its swans or rafts. And that river ran, bearing<br>away heroes like trees along its current. (Even) necklaces constituted<br>its assemblage of lotuses, and head-gears formed its excellent foam. Bows<br>and shafts constituted its fishes; and the crowns of crushed men floated<br>on its surface. Shields and armour were its eddies, and cars were the<br>rafts with which it teemed. And it could be easily forded by persons<br>desirous of victory, while to those that were cowards it was unfordable.<br>Having caused that river to flow, Vibhatsu, that slayer of hostile heroes<br>and bull among men, addressing Vasudeva said, "Yonder, O Krishna, the<br>standard of the Suta's son is visible. There, Bhimasena and others are<br>fighting with that great car-warrior. There, the Pancalas, afraid of<br>Karna, are flying away, O Janardana. Yonder, king Duryodhana, with the<br>white umbrella over his head, along with Karna, looketh exceedingly<br>resplendent as he is engaged in routing the Pancalas. There Kripa, and<br>Kritavarma, and Drona's son, that mighty car-warrior, are protecting king<br>Duryodhana, themselves protected by the Suta's son. There, O Krishna,<br>Shalya, well conversant with holding the reins, looketh exceedingly<br>resplendent as, seated on the terrace of Karna's car, he guideth that<br>vehicle. Bear me to that mighty car-warrior, for even such is the wish<br>cherished by me. Without slaying Karna in this battle I will never<br>return. Otherwise, the son of Radha, O Janardana, will, in my sight,<br>exterminate the mighty car-warriors of the Parthas and the Srinjayas."<br>Thus addressed, Keshava quickly proceeded on his car, towards the mighty<br>bowman Karna, for causing a single combat to take place between Karna and<br>Savyasaci. Indeed, the mighty-armed Hari, at the command of Pandu's son,<br>proceeded on his car, assuring (by that very act) all the Pandava troops.<br>The rattle then of Arjuna's vehicle rose loud in that battle, resembling,<br>O sire, the tremendous peal of Vasu's thunder. Beholding Arjuna of white<br>steeds and having Krishna for his driver thus advance, and seeing the<br>standard of that high-souled one, the king of the Madras, addressing<br>Karna, said, "There cometh that car-warrior having white steeds yoked<br>unto his vehicle and having Krishna for his driver, slaying his foes in<br>battle. There cometh he about whom thou wert enquiring, holding his bow<br>Gandiva. If thou canst slay him today, great good may then be done to us.<br>He cometh, O Karna, desirous of an encounter with thee, slaying, as he<br>cometh, our chief warriors. Do thou proceed against that hero of<br>Bharata's race. Avoiding all our warriors, Dhananjaya advanceth with<br>great speed, for, as I think, an encounter with thee, judging by his form<br>swelling with rage and energy. Blazing with wrath, Partha will not stop<br>from desire of battle with anybody else save thee, especially when<br>Vrikodara is being so much afflicted (by thee). Learning that king<br>Yudhishthira the just hath been exceedingly mangled and made carless by<br>thee, and seeing (the plight of) Shikhandi, and Satyaki, and<br>Dhrishtadyumna, the son of Prishata, and the (five) sons of Draupadi, and<br>Yudhamanyu, and Uttamauja, and the brothers, Nakula and Sahadeva, that<br>scorcher of foes, Partha, advanceth impetuously on a single car against<br>thee. Without doubt, he is advancing with speed against us, avoiding<br>other combatants. Do thou, O Karna, proceed against him, for there is no<br>other bowman (among us that can do so). I do not behold any arrangements<br>made for his protection, either on his flanks or at his rear. He<br>advanceth alone against thee. Look after thy success now. Thou alone art<br>able to encounter the two Krishnas in battle. Proceed, therefore, against<br>Dhananjaya. Thou art the equal of Bhishma, of Drona, of Drona's son, of<br>Kripa. Do thou resist in this great battle the advancing Savyasaci.<br>Indeed, O Karna, slay this Dhananjaya that resembles a snake frequently<br>darting out its tongue, or a roaring bull, or a tiger in the forest.<br>There, those kings, those mighty car-warriors of the Dhritarashtra's<br>army, through fear of Arjuna, are quickly flying away, regardless of one<br>another. Save thee, O Suta's son, there is no other man, O hero, that<br>can, in battle, dispel the fears of those retreating combatants. All<br>those Kurus, O tiger among men, obtaining thee as their refuge in this<br>battle, stand depending on thee and desirous of thy protection. Mustering<br>thy great prowess, O mighty-armed one, proceed against Vrishni's race,<br>who is always gratified by the diadem-decked (Arjuna)."<br><br>"'Karna said, "Thou seemest now to be in thy usual frame of mind and thou<br>art now agreeable to me. Do not, O mighty-armed one, entertain any fear<br>of Dhananjaya. Behold the might of my arms today, and behold my skill.<br>Single-handed, I will today destroy the mighty host of the Pandavas, as<br>also those two lions among men, the two Krishnas! I say this truly unto<br>thee. I will never return from the field today without slaying two<br>heroes. Or, slain by those two, I shall today sleep on the field of<br>battle. Victory is uncertain in battle. Slaying or slain, I shall today<br>achieve my purpose."<br><br>"'Shalya said, "All great car-warriors, O Karna, say that this foremost<br>of car-warriors, (Arjuna), even when alone, is invincible. When again, he<br>is protected by Krishna, who will venture to vanquish him?"<br><br>"'Karna said, "As far as I have heard, such a superior car-warrior has<br>never been born on earth! Behold my prowess, since I will contend in<br>battle with even that Partha who is such. This prince of Kuru's line,<br>this foremost of car-warriors, careers in battle, borne by his steeds<br>white in hue. Perhaps he will despatch me to Yama's abode today. Know,<br>however, that with Karna's death, these all will be exterminated. The two<br>arms of this prince are never covered with sweat. They never tremble.<br>They are massive and covered with cicatrices. Firm in the use of weapons,<br>he is possessed of great skill and endued with great lightness of hands.<br>Indeed, there is no warrior equal to the son of Pandu. He taketh a large<br>number of arrows and shooteth them as if they were one. Quickly fixing<br>them on the bow-string, he propelleth them to the distance of two miles.<br>They always fall on the foe. What warriors is there on earth that is<br>equal to him? That Atiratha, endued with great activity, with Krishna as<br>his ally, gratified the god Agni at Khandava. There, on that occasion,<br>the high-souled Krishna obtained his discus, and Savyasaci, the son of<br>Pandu, obtained his bow Gandiva. There that mighty-armed one, endued with<br>might that knows no decay, also obtained his terrible car unto which are<br>yoked those white steeds, as also his two great celestial and<br>inexhaustible quivers, and many celestial weapons, from the God of Fire.<br>In the region of Indra he obtained his conch Devadatta and slew<br>innumerable Daityas, and all the Kalakeyas. Who is there on earth that is<br>superior to him? Possessed of greatness of soul, he gratified Mahadeva<br>himself in fair fight, and obtained from him the terrible and mighty<br>weapon Pasupata that is capable of destroying the three worlds. The<br>several Regents of the world, united together gave him their weapons of<br>immeasurable energy, with which that lion among men quickly destroyed in<br>battle those united Asuras, the Kalakhanjas. So also, in Virata's city,<br>moving on a single car he vanquished all of us, and snatched from us that<br>wealth of kine, and took from all the foremost of car-warriors (portions<br>of) their garments. Challenging that foremost of Kshatriyas, that hero<br>having him of Vrishni's race for his ally, that warrior who is endued<br>with such energy and such attributes, I regard myself, O Shalya, to be<br>the foremost of persons in all the world in point of courage. He is,<br>again, protected by that Keshava of great energy, who is Narayana himself<br>and who is without a rival, that high-souled Vasudeva, that<br>ever-victorious Vishnu armed with conch, discus, and mace, whose<br>attributes all the world united together, cannot (in narrating) exhaust<br>in 10,000 years. Beholding the two Krishnas together on the same car,<br>fear entereth my heart together with courage. Partha is the foremost of<br>all bowmen, while Narayana is unrivalled in encounters with the discus.<br>Even such are Vasudeva, and the son of Pandu. Indeed, the mountains of<br>Himavat may move from the spot where they stand but not the two Krishnas.<br>Both of them are heroes, possessed of great skill, firm in the use of<br>weapons, and mighty car-warriors. Both of them have adamantine frames.<br>Who else, O Shalya, save myself, would proceed against Phalguna and<br>Vasudeva that are even such? The desire cherished by me today, viz., that<br>of a battle with the son of Pandu, O ruler of the Madras, will be<br>fulfilled without delay. Soon will that wonderful and matchless and<br>beautiful battle take place. Either I will overthrow those two in battle<br>today, or the two Krishnas will today overthrow me." Saying these words<br>unto Shalya, Karna, that slayer of foes, began to utter loud roars in<br>that battle, like those of the clouds. Approaching then thy son, that<br>foremost one among the Kurus, and saluted respectfully by him, Karna said<br>unto that prince as also unto those two mighty-armed warriors, Kripa and<br>the Bhoja chief Kritavarma, and the ruler of the Gandharvas with his son,<br>and the preceptors and his own younger brothers, and all the<br>foot-soldiers and horsemen and elephant-riders, these words, "Rush<br>towards Acyuta and Arjuna and close up their path all around, and cause<br>them to be tired with exertion, so that, ye lords of the earth, I may<br>easily slay those two after ye all will have mangled them deeply."<br>Saying, "So be it!" those foremost of heroes, desirous of slaying Arjuna,<br>speedily proceeded against him. Those mighty car-warriors then, obeying<br>the behest of Karna, began to strike Dhananjaya with innumerable arrows<br>in that battle. Like the great ocean containing a vast quantity of water<br>receiving all rivers with their tributaries Arjuna received all those<br>warriors in battle. His foes could not notice when he fixed his excellent<br>arrows on the bow-string and when he let them off. All that could be seen<br>was that men and steeds and elephants, pierced with the arrows sped by<br>Dhananjaya, continually fell down, deprived of life. Like men with<br>diseased eyes that are unable to gaze at the sun, the Kauravas on that<br>occasion could not gaze at Jaya who seemed to be possessed of the energy<br>of the all-destroying Sun that rises at the end of the Yuga, having<br>arrows for his rays, and Gandiva for his beautiful circular disc. Smiling<br>the while, Partha with his own showers of arrows cut off the excellent<br>arrows sped at him by those mighty car-warriors. In return, he struck<br>them with innumerable arrows, drawing his bow Gandiva to a complete<br>circle. As the sun of fierce rays between the months of Jyaishtha and<br>Ashadha easily drieth up the waters (of the earth), even so Arjuna,<br>baffling the arrows of his foes, consumed thy troops, O king of kings!<br>Then Kripa, and the chief of the Bhojas, and thy son himself shooting<br>showers of shafts, rushed towards him. Drona's son also, that mighty<br>car-warrior, rushed towards him, shooting his shafts. Indeed, all of them<br>rained their arrows on him, like the clouds pouring torrents of rain on a<br>mountain. The son of Pandu, however, with great activity and speed, cut<br>off with his own shafts those excellent arrows sped at him with great<br>care in that dreadful battle by those accomplished warriors desirous of<br>slaying him, and pierced the chest of each of his adversaries with three<br>shafts. Having arrows for his fierce rays, the Arjuna sun, with gandiva<br>drawn to its fullest stretch constituting his corona, looked resplendent,<br>as he scorched his foes, like the Sun himself between the months of<br>Jyeshtha and Ashadha, within his bright corona. Then Drona's son pierced<br>Dhananjaya with ten foremost of shafts, and Keshava with three, and the<br>four steeds of Dhananjaya with four, and showered many shafts on the Ape<br>on Arjuna's banner. For all that, Dhananjaya cut off the full drawn bow<br>in his adversary's hand with three shafts, the head of his driver with a<br>razor-faced arrow, and his four steeds with his four other shafts and his<br>standard with three other arrows and felled him from his car. The son of<br>Drona then, filled with wrath, took up another costly bow, bright as the<br>body of Takshaka, and decked with gems and diamonds and gold, and<br>resembling a mighty snake caught from the foot of a mountain. Stringing<br>that bow as he stood on the earth, and bringing out one after another<br>shafts and weapons, Drona's son, that warrior who excelled in many<br>accomplishments, began to afflict those two unvanquished and foremost of<br>men and pierce them from a near point with many shafts. Then those mighty<br>car-warriors, Kripa and Bhoja and thy son, standing at the van of battle,<br>fell upon and shrouded that bull among the Pandavas, shooting showers of<br>shafts, like clouds shrouding the dispeller of darkness. Possessed of<br>prowess equal to that of the thousand-armed (Kartavirya), Partha then<br>showered his shafts on Kripa's bow with arrow fixed on it, his steeds,<br>his standard, and his driver, like the wielder of the thunder in days of<br>yore showering his shafts on (the asura) Vali. His weapons destroyed by<br>Partha's shafts, and his standard also having been crushed in that great<br>battle, Kripa was afflicted with as many thousands of arrows by Arjuna as<br>Ganga's son Bhishma before them (on the day of his fall) by the same<br>diademdecked warrior. The valiant Partha then, with his shafts, cut off<br>the standard and the bow of thy roaring son. Destroying next the handsome<br>steeds of Kritavarma, he cut off the latter's standard as well. He then<br>began to destroy with great speed the elephants of the hostile force, as<br>also its cars with their steeds and drivers and bows and standards.<br>Thereupon that vast host of thine broke into a hundred parts like an<br>embankment washed off by the waters. Then Keshava, quickly urging<br>Arjuna's car, placed all his afflicted foes on his right side. Then other<br>warriors, desirous of an encounter, with their well-equipped cars bearing<br>lofty standards, followed Dhananjaya who was proceeding with great speed<br>like Indra proceeding for the slaughter of Vritra. Then those mighty<br>car-warriors, Shikhandi and Satyaki and the twins, proceeding in the<br>direction of Dhananjaya, checked those foes and, piercing them with keen<br>arrows, uttered terrible roars. Then the Kuru heroes and the Srinjayas,<br>encountering one another with rage, slew one another with straight shafts<br>of great energy, like the Asuras and the celestials in days of yore in<br>great battle. Elephant-warriors and horsemen and car-warriors,&#8212;all<br>chastisers of foes,&#8212;inspired with desire of victory or impatient of<br>proceeding to heaven, fell fast on the field. Uttering loud shouts, they<br>pierced one another vigorously with well-shot arrows. In consequence of<br>those high-souled warriors of great courage shooting their arrows at one<br>another in that dreadful battle and by that means causing a darkness<br>there, the points of the compass, cardinal and subsidiary became<br>enveloped in gloom and the very effulgence of the sun became totally<br>shrouded.'"
