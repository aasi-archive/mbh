                            "Bhima said, 'I am the son of Pandu, and next by birth to Yudhishthira<br>the just, and my name is Bhimasena. O Rakshasas, I have come with my<br>brothers to the jujube named Visala. At that place, Panchali saw an<br>excellent Saugandhika lotus, which, of a certainty, was carried thither<br>by the wind from this region. She wisheth to have those flowers in<br>abundance. Know ye, ye Rakshasas, that I am engaged in fulfilling the<br>desire of my wedded wife of faultless features, and have come hither to<br>procure the flowers. Thereat the Rakshasas said, 'O foremost of men, this<br>spot is dear unto Kuvera, and it is his sporting region. Men subject to<br>death cannot sport here. O Vrikodara. the celestial sages, and the gods<br>taking the permission of the chief of the Yakshas, drink of this lake,<br>and sport herein. And, O Pandava, the Gandharvas and the Apsaras also<br>divert themselves in this lake. That wicked person who, disregarding the<br>lord of treasures, unlawfully attempteth to sport here, without doubt,<br>meeteth with destruction. Disregarding him, thou seekest to take away the<br>lotuses from this place by main force. Why then dost thou say that thou<br>art the brother of Yudhishthira the just? First, taking the permission of<br>the lord of Yakshas, do thou drink of this lake and take away the<br>flowers. If thou dost not do this, thou shall not be able even to glance<br>at a single lotus Bhimasena said, 'Ye Rakshasas, I do not see the lord of<br>wealth here And even if I did see that mighty king, I would not beseech<br>him Kshatriyas never beseech (any body). This is the eternal morality;<br>and I by no means wish to forsake the Kshatriya morality. And, further<br>this lotus-lake hath sprung from the cascades of the mountain; it hath<br>not been excavated in the mansion of Kuvera. Therefore it belongeth<br>equally to all creatures with Vaisravana. In regard to a thing of such a<br>nature, who goeth to beseech another?"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Having said this unto the Rakshasas, the mighty-armed<br>and exceedingly unforbearing Bhimasena of great strength plunged into the<br>lotus-lake. Thereat that powerful one was forbidden by the Rakshasas,<br>saying, 'Do not do this;' and they from all sides began to abuse him in<br>anger. But slighting these Rakshasas, that mighty one of dreadful prowess<br>plunged (farther and farther). Now they all prepared for opposing him.<br>And with eyes rolling, they upraised their arms, and rushed in wrath at<br>Bhimasena, exclaiming, 'Seize him!' 'Bind him! Hew him! We shall cook<br>Bhimasena, and eat him up!' Thereupon that one of great force, taking his<br>ponderous and mighty mace inlaid with golden plates, like unto the mace<br>of Yama himself, turned towards those, and then said, 'Stay!' At this,<br>they darted at him with vehemence, brandishing lances, and axes, and<br>other weapons. And wishing to destroy Bhima, the dreadful and fierce<br>Krodhavasas surrounded Bhima on all sides. But that one, being endued<br>with strength, had been begotten by Vayu in the womb of Kunti; and he was<br>heroic and energetic, and the slayer of foes, and ever devoted to virtue<br>and truth, and incapable of being vanquished by enemies through prowess.<br>Accordingly this high-souled Bhima defeating all the manoeuveres of the<br>foes, and breaking their arms, killed on the banks of the lake more than<br>a hundred, commencing with the foremost. And then witnessing his prowess<br>and strength, and the force of his skill, and also the might of his arms;<br>and unable to bear (the onset), those prime heroes all of a sudden fled<br>on all sides in bands.<br><br>"Beaten and pierced by Bhimasena, those Krodhavasas quitted the field of<br>battle, and in confusion quickly fled towards the Kailasa cliff,<br>supporting themselves in the sky. Having thus by the exercise of his<br>prowess defeated those hosts, even as Sakra had defeated the armies of<br>Daityas and Danavas, he (Bhima), now that he had conquered the enemy,<br>plunged into the lake and began to gather the lotuses, with the object of<br>gaining his purpose. And as he drank of the waters, like unto nectar, his<br>energy and strength were again fully restored; and he fell to plucking<br>and gathering Saugandhika lotuses of excellent fragrance. On the other<br>hand, the Krodhavasas, being driven by the might of Bhima and exceedingly<br>terrified, presented themselves before the lord of wealth, and gave an<br>exact account of Bhima's prowess and strength in fight. Hearing their<br>words, the god (Kuvera) smiled and then said, 'Let Bhima take for Krishna<br>as many lotuses as he likes. This is already known to me.' Thereupon<br>taking the permission of the lord of wealth, those (Rakshasas) renouncing<br>anger, went to that foremost of the Kurus, and in that lotus-lake beheld<br>Bhima alone, disporting in delight."
