                            Vaisampayana said, "O chief of the Bharata race! then the son of Kunti<br>went at a slow pace to the two rivers Nanda and Aparananda, which had the<br>virtue of destroying the dread of sin. And the protector of men having<br>reached the healthy hill Hemakuta, beheld there very many strange and<br>inconceivable sights. There the very utterance of words caused the<br>gathering of clouds, and a thousand volleys of stones. And people at its<br>sight, were struck sad, and were unable to ascend the hill. There the<br>winds blew for aye, and the heavens always poured down rains; and<br>likewise the sounds of the recitation of the sacred writ were heard, yet<br>nobody was seen. In the evening and in the morning would be seen the<br>blessed fire that carries offerings to the gods and there flies would<br>bite and interrupt the practice of austerities. And there a sadness would<br>overtake the soul, and people would become sick. The son of Pandu, having<br>observed very many strange circumstances of this character again<br>addressed his questions to Lomasa with reference to these wonderful<br>things.<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'O slayer of foes! O king! I am going to tell thee as we<br>heard it before; do thou attend to the same with intent mind. In this<br>peak of Rishava, there was once a saint known by that name. And his life<br>had lasted for many hundred years. And he was devoted to penances and was<br>greatly wrathful. And he, forsooth, for having been spoken to by others,<br>from wrath addressed the hill thus, 'Whoever should utter any words here,<br>thou must throw stones at him, and thou must call up the winds to prevent<br>him from making any noise.' This was what the saint said. And so at this<br>place, as soon as a man utters any words, he is forbidden by a roaring<br>cloud. O king! thus these deeds were performed by that great saint, and<br>from wrath he also forbade other acts. O king! tradition says that when<br>the gods of yore had come to the Nanda, suddenly came over (there) a<br>number of men to look at the celestials. Those same gods at whose head<br>stood Indra did not, however, like to be seen; and so they rendered this<br>spot inaccessible, by raising obstructions in the form of hills. And from<br>that day forward, O Kunti's son! men could not cast their eyes at any<br>time on what looked like a hill, far less could they ascend the same.<br>This big mountain is incapable of being seen by one who hath not led an<br>austere life, nor can such a one ascend it. Therefore, O son of Kunti!<br>keep thou thy tongue under control. Here at that time all those gods<br>performed the best sacrificial rites. O Bharata's son! Even up to this<br>day these marks thereof may be seen. This grass here hath the form of the<br>sacred kusa grass: the ground here seemeth to be overspread with the<br>sacred grass; and. O lord of men! many of these trees here look like the<br>spots for tying the sacrificial beasts. O Bharata's son! still the Gods<br>and saints have residence here; and their sacred fire is observed in the<br>morning and in the evening. Here if one bathes, his sin is forthwith<br>destroyed, O Kunti's son! O most praiseworthy of the race of Kuru! do<br>thou, therefore, perform thy ablutions, together with thy younger<br>brothers. Then after having washed thyself in the Nanda, thou wilt repair<br>to the river Kausiki, the spot where the most excellent and severest form<br>of penances was practised by Viswamitra. Then the king with his<br>attendants, having washed his body there, proceeded to the river Kausiki,<br>which was pure and delightful and pleasant with cool water.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'This is the pure divine river by name Kausiki. O chief of<br>Bharata's race! and this is the delightful hermitage of Viswamitra,<br>conspicuous here. And this is a hermitage, with a holy name, belonging to<br>Kasyapa of mighty soul; whose son was Rishyasringa, devoted to penances,<br>and of passions under control. He by force of his penances caused Indra<br>to rain; and that god, the slayer of the demons Vala and Vritra, dreading<br>him, poured down rain during a drought. That powerful and mighty son of<br>Kasyapa was born of a hind. He worked a great marvel in the territory of<br>Lomapada. And when the crops had been restored, king Lomapada gave his<br>daughter Santa in marriage to him, as the sun gave in marriage his<br>daughter Savitri.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'How was the son of Kasyapa, Rishyasringa, born of a<br>hind? And how was he endowed with holiness, being the issue of a<br>reprehensible sexual connexion? And for what reason was Indra, the slayer<br>of the demons Vala and Vritra, afraid of that same sagacious boy, and<br>poured down rain during a period of drought? And how beautiful was that<br>princess Santa, pure in life, she who allured the heart of him when he<br>had turned himself into a stag? And since the royal saint Lomapada is<br>said to have been of a virtuous disposition, why was it that in his<br>territory, Indra, the chastiser of the demon Paka, had withheld rain? O<br>holy saint! all this in detail, exactly as it happened, thou wilt be<br>pleased to narrate to me, for I am desirous of hearing the deeds of<br>Rishyasringa's life.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'Hear how Rishyasringa, of dreaded name, was born as a son<br>to Vibhandaka, who was a saint of the Brahmana caste, who had cultured<br>his soul by means of religious austerities, whose seed never failed in<br>causing generation, and who was learned and bright like the Lord of<br>beings. And the father was highly honoured, and the son was possessed of<br>a mighty spirit, and, though a boy, was respected by aged man. And that<br>son of Kasyapa, Vibhandaka, having proceeded to a big lake, devoted<br>himself to the practice of penances. And that same saint, comparable to a<br>god, laboured for a long period. And once while he was washing his mouth<br>in the waters, he beheld the celestial nymph Urvasi&#8212;whereupon came out<br>his seminal fluid. And, O king! a hind at that time lapped it up along<br>with the water that she was drinking, being athirst; and from this cause<br>she became with child. That same hind had really been a daughter of the<br>gods, and had been told of yore by the holy Brahma, the creator of the<br>worlds, 'Thou shall be a hind; and when in that form, thou shall give<br>birth to a saint; thou shalt then be freed.' As Destiny would have it,<br>and as the word of the creator would not be untrue, in that same hind was<br>born his (Vibhandaka's) son a mighty saint. And Rishyasringa, devoted to<br>penances, always passed his days in the forest. O king! there was a horn<br>on the head of that magnanimous saint and for this reason did he come to<br>be known at the time by the name of Rishyasringa. And barring his father,<br>not a man had ever before been seen by him; therefore his mind, O<br>protector of men! was entirely devoted to the duties of a continent life.<br>At this very period there was a ruler of the land of Anga known by the<br>name of Lomapada who was a friend of Dasaratha. We have heard that he<br>from love of pleasure had been guilty of a falsehood towards a Brahmana.<br>And that same ruler of the world had at that time been shunned by all<br>persons of the priestly class. And he was without a ministering priest<br>(to assist him in his religious rites). And the god of a thousand eyes<br>(Indra) suddenly abstained from giving rain in his territory; so that his<br>people began to suffer and O lord of the earth! he questioned a number of<br>Brahmanas, devoted to penances, of cultivated minds, and possessed of<br>capabilities with reference to the matter of rain being granted by the<br>lord of gods, saying, 'How may the heavens grant us the rain? Think of an<br>expedient (for this purpose).' And those same cultured men, being thus<br>questioned, gave expression to their respective views. And one among<br>them&#8212;the best of saints&#8212;spake to that same king, saying, 'O lord of<br>kings! the Brahmanas are angry with thee. Do some act (therefore) for<br>appeasing them. O ruler of the earth! send for Rishyasringa, the son of a<br>saint, resident of the forest knowing nothing of the female sex, and<br>always taking delight in simplicity. O king! if he, great in the practice<br>of penances, should show himself in thy territory, forthwith rain would<br>be granted by the heavens, herein I have no doubt at all.' And, O king!<br>having heard these words Lomapada made atonement for his sins. And he<br>went away; and when the Brahmanas had been appeased, he returned again,<br>and seeing the king returned, the people were again glad at heart. Then<br>the king of Anga convened a meeting of his ministers, proficient in<br>giving counsel. And he took great pains in order to settle some plan for<br>securing a visit from Rishyasringa. And, O unswerving (prince)! with<br>those ministers, who were versed in all branches of knowledge, and<br>exceedingly proficient in worldly matters, and had a thorough training in<br>practical affairs, he at last settled a plan (for gaining his object).<br>And then he sent for a number of courtesans, women of the town, clever in<br>everything. And when they came, that same ruler of the earth spake to<br>them, saying, 'Ye lovely women! Ye must find some means to allure, and<br>obtain the confidence of the son of the saint&#8212;Rishyasringa, whom ye must<br>bring over to my territory.' And those same women, on the one hand afraid<br>of the anger of the king and on the other, dreading a curse from the<br>saint, became sad and confounded, and declared the business to be beyond<br>their power. One, however, among them&#8212;a hoary woman, thus spake to the<br>king, 'O great king! him whose wealth solely consists in penances, I<br>shall try to bring over here. Thou wilt, however, have to procure for me<br>certain things, in connection with the plan. In that case, I may be able<br>to bring over the son of the saint&#8212;Rishyasringa.' Thereupon the king<br>gave an order that all that she might ask for should be procured. And he<br>also gave a good deal of wealth and jewels of various kinds. And then, O<br>Lord of the earth, she took with herself a number of women endowed with<br>beauty and youth, and went to the forest without delay."
