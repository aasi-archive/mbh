                            Janamejaya said, "What did those tigers among men, the Pandavas, do,<br>after they had suffered such misery in consequence of the ravishment of<br>Draupadi?"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Having defeated Jayadratha and rescued Krishna, the<br>virtuous king Yudhishthira took his seat by the side of that best of<br>Munis. And among those foremost of ascetics who were expressing their<br>grief upon bearing Draupadi's misfortune, Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu,<br>addressed Markandeya, saying, 'O adorable Sire, amongst the gods and the<br>ascetics, thou art known to have the fullest knowledge of both the past<br>as well as; the future. A doubt existeth in my mind, which I would ask<br>thee to solve! This lady is the daughter of Drupada; she hath issued from<br>the sacrificial altar and hath not been begotten of the flesh; and she is<br>highly blessed and is also the daughter-in-law of the illustrious Pandu.<br>I incline to think that Time, and human Destiny that dependeth on our<br>acts, and the Inevitable, are irresistible in respect of creatures. (If<br>it were not so), how could such a misfortune afflict this wife of ours so<br>faithful and virtuous, like a false accusation of theft against an honest<br>man? The daughter of Drupada hath never committed any sinful act, nor,<br>hath she done anything that is not commendable: on the contrary, she hath<br>assiduously practised the highest virtues towards Brahmanas. And yet the<br>foolish king Jayadratha had carried her away by force. In consequence of<br>this act of violence on her, that sinful wretch hath his hair shaved off<br>his head and sustained also, with all his allies, defeat in battle. It is<br>true we have rescued her after slaughtering the troops of Sindhu. But the<br>disgrace of this ravishment of our wife during our hours of carelessness,<br>hath stained us, to be sure. This life in the wilderness is full of<br>miseries. We subsist by chase; and though dwelling in the woods, we are<br>obliged to slay the denizens thereof that live with us! This exile also<br>that we suffer is due to the act of deceitful kinsmen! Is there any one<br>who is more unfortunate than I am? Hath thou ever seen or heard of such a<br>one before?"
