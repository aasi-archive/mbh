                            "Vrihadaswa said, 'Like a bird coursing through the sky, Nala soon<br>crossed rivers and mountains, and woods and lakes. And while the car was<br>coursing thus, that conqueror of hostile cities, the royal son of<br>Bhangasura, saw his upper garment drop down on the ground. And at soon as<br>his garment had dropped down the high-minded monarch, without loss of<br>time, told Nala, 'I intend to recover it. O thou of profound<br>intelligence, retain these steeds endued with exceeding swiftness until<br>Varshneya bringeth back my garment.' Thereupon Nala replied unto him,<br>'The sheet is dropped down far away. We have travelled one yojana thence.<br>Therefore, it is incapable of being recovered.' After Nala had addressed<br>him thus, O king, the royal son of Bhangasura came upon a Vibhitaka tree<br>with fruits in a forest. And seeing that tree, the king hastily said to<br>Vahuka, 'O charioteer, do thou also behold my high proficiency in<br>calculation. All men do not know everything. There is no one that is<br>versed in every science of art. Knowledge in its entirety is not found in<br>any one person, O Vahuka, the leaves and fruits of this tree that are<br>lying on the ground respectively exceed those that are on it by one<br>hundred and one. The two branches of the tree have fifty millions of<br>leaves, and two thousand and ninety five fruits. Do thou examine these<br>two branches and all their boughs.' Thereupon staying the car Vahuka<br>addressed the king, saying, 'O crusher of foes, thou takest credit to<br>thyself in a matter which is beyond my perception. But, O monarch, I will<br>ascertain it by the direct evidence of my senses, by cutting down the<br>Vibhitaka. O king, when I actually count, it will no longer be matter of<br>speculation. Therefore, in thy presence, O monarch, I will hew down this<br>Vibhitaka. I do not know whether it be not (as thou hast said). In thy<br>presence, O ruler of men, I will count the fruits and leaves. Let<br>Varshneya hold the reins of the horses for a while.' Unto the charioteer<br>the king replied, 'There is no time to lose.' But Vahuka answered with<br>humility, 'Stay thou a short space, or, if thou art in a hurry, go then,<br>making Varshneya thy charioteer. The road lies direct and even.' And at<br>this, O son of the Kuru race, soothing Vahuka, Rituparna said, 'O Vahuka,<br>thou art the only charioteer, there is none other in this world. And, O<br>thou versed in horse lore, it is through thy help that I expect to go to<br>the Vidarbhas. I place myself in thy hands. It behoveth thee not to cause<br>any obstacle. And, O Vahuka, whatever thy wish. I will grant it if taking<br>me to the country of the Vidarbhas to-day, thou makest me see the sun<br>rise.' At this, Vahuka answered him, saying, 'After having counted (the<br>leaves and fruits of the) Vibhitaka, I shall proceed to Vidarbha, do thou<br>agree to my words. Then the king reluctantly told him, 'Count. And on<br>counting the leaves and fruits of a portion of this branch, thou wilt be<br>satisfied of the truth of my assertion.' And thereupon Vahuka speedily<br>alighted from the car, and felled that tree. And struck with amazement<br>upon finding the fruits, after calculation, to be what the king had said,<br>he addressed the king, saying, 'O monarch, this thy power is wonderful. I<br>desire, O prince, to know the art by which thou hast ascertained all<br>this.' And at this king, intent upon proceeding speedily, said unto<br>Vahuka. 'Know that I am proficient at dice besides being versed in<br>numbers. And Vahuka said unto him, 'Impart unto me this knowledge and, O<br>bull among men, take from me my knowledge of horses.' And king Rituparna,<br>having regard to the importance of the act that depended upon Vahuka's<br>good-will, and tempted also by the horse-lore (that his charioteer<br>possessed), said, 'So be it.' As solicited by thee, receive this science<br>of dice from me, and, O Vahuka, let my equine science remain with thee in<br>trust.' And saying this, Rituparna imparted unto Nala the science (he<br>desired). And Nala upon becoming acquainted with the science of dice,<br>Kali came out of his body, incessantly vomiting from his mouth the<br>virulent poison of Karkotaka.<br><br>And when Kali, afflicted (by Damayanti's curse) came out (of Nala's<br>body), the fire of that curse also left Kali. Indeed, long had been the<br>time for which the king had been afflicted by Kali, as if he were of<br>unregenerate soul. And Kala the ruler of the Nishadhas, in wrath, was<br>bent upon cursing Kali, when the latter, frightened, and trembling, said<br>with joined hands, 'Control thy wrath, O king! I will render thee<br>illustrious. Indrasena's mother had formerly cursed me in anger when she<br>had been deserted by thee. Ever since that time undergoing sore<br>affliction I resided in thee, O mighty monarch, O unconquered one,<br>miserably and burning night and day with the venom of the prince of<br>snakes. I seek thy protection. If thou dost not curse me who am<br>affrighted and seek thy protection, then those men that will attentively<br>recite thy history, shall be even free from fear on my account.' And thus<br>addressed by Kali, king Nala controlled his wrath. And thereupon the<br>frightened Kali speedily entered into the Vibhitaka tree. And while the<br>Kali was conversing with Naishadha, he was invisible to others. And<br>delivered from his afflictions, and having counted the fruits of that<br>tree, the king, filled with great joy and of high energy, mounted on the<br>car and proceeded with energy, urging those fleet horses. And from the<br>touch of Kali the Vibhitaka tree from that hour fell into disrepute. And<br>Nala, with a glad heart, began to urge those foremost of steeds which<br>sprang into the air once and again like creatures endued with wings. And<br>the illustrious monarch drove (the car) in the direction of the<br>Vidarbhas. And after Nala had gone far away, Kali also returned to his<br>abode. And abandoned by Kali, O king, that lord of earth, the royal Nala,<br>became freed from calamity though he did not assume his native form.'"
