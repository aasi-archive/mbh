                            "Markandeya continued, 'When that powerful, high-souled, and mighty being<br>was born, various kinds of fearful phenomena occurred. And the nature of<br>males and females, of heat and cold, and of such other pairs of<br>contraries, was reversed. And the planets, the cardinal points and the<br>firmaments became radiant with light and the earth began to rumble very<br>much. And the Rishis even, seeking the welfare of the world, while they<br>observed all these terrific prodigies on all sides, began with anxious<br>hearts to restore tranquillity in the universe. And those who used to<br>live in that Chitraratha forest said, This very miserable condition of<br>ours hath been brought about by Agni cohabiting with the six wives of the<br>seven Rishis.' Others again who had seen the goddess assume the disguise<br>of a bird said, 'This evil hath been brought about by a bird.' No one<br>ever imagined that Swaha was the authoress of that mischief. But having<br>heard that the (new born) male child was hers, she went to Skanda and<br>gradually revealed to him the fact that she was his mother. And those<br>seven Rishis, when they heard that a son of great power had been born (to<br>them), divorced their six wives with the exception of the adorable<br>Arundhati, because all the dwellers of that forest protested that those<br>six persons had been instrumental in bringing forth the child. Swaha too,<br>O king, said again and again to the seven Rishis, saying, 'Ye ascetics,<br>this child is mine, your wives are not his mother.'<br><br>The great Muni Viswamitra had, after the conclusion of the sacrifices of<br>the seven Rishis, followed unseen the god of fire, while the latter was<br>tortured with lust. He, therefore, knew everything as it happened and he<br>was the first to seek the protection of Mahasena. And he offered divine<br>prayers to Mahasena and all the thirteen auspicious rites appertaining to<br>childhood, such as the natal and other ceremonies, were all performed by<br>the great Muni in respect of that child. And for the good of the world he<br>promulgated the virtues of the six-faced Skanda, and performed ceremonies<br>in honour of the cock, the goddess Sakti, and the first followers of<br>Skanda. And for this reason he became a great favourite of the celestial<br>youth. That great Muni then informed the seven Rishis, of the<br>transformations of Swaha and told them that their wives were perfectly<br>innocent. But though thus informed the seven Rishis abandoned their<br>spouses unconditionally.<br><br>Markandeya continued, The celestials having heard of the prowess of<br>Skanda, all said to Vasava, 'O Sakra, do thou kill Skanda without delay<br>for his prowess is unbearable. And if thou dost not exterminate him, he<br>will conquer the three worlds with ourselves, and overpowering thee, will<br>himself become the mighty lord of the celestials.' Perplexed in mind,<br>Sakra replied unto them, 'This child is endowed with great prowess. He<br>can himself destroy the Creator of the Universe, in battle putting forth<br>his might. I venture not, therefore, to do away with him.' To this the<br>gods replied, 'Thou hast no manliness in thee, in that thou talkest in<br>this manner. Let the great Mothers of the Universe repair to-day to<br>Skanda. They can master at will any degree of energy. Let then kill this<br>child.' 'It shall be so.'&#8212;the mothers replied. And then they went away.<br>But on beholding that he was possessed of great might, they became<br>dispirited, and considering that he was invincible, they sought his<br>protection and said unto him, 'Do thou, O mighty being, become our<br>(adopted) son. We are full of affection for thee and desirous of giving<br>thee suck. Lo, the milk oozes from our breasts!' On hearing these words,<br>the mighty Mahasena became desirous of sucking their breasts and he<br>received them with due respect and acceded to their request. And that<br>mightiest of mighty creatures then beheld his father Agni come towards<br>him. And that god, who is the doer of all that is good, was duly honoured<br>by his son, and in company with the Mothers, he stayed there by the side<br>of Mahasena to tend him. And that lady amongst the Mothers who was born<br>of Anger[74] with a spike in hand kept watch over Skanda even like a<br>mother guarding her own offspring, and that irascible red-coloured<br>daughter of the Sea, who lived herself on blood, hugged Mahasena in her<br>breast and nursed him like a mother. And Agni transforming himself into a<br>trader with a goat's mouth and followed by numerous children began to<br>gratify that child of his with toys in that mountain abode of his."
