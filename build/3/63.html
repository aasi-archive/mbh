                            Vrihadaswa said, "O king, after Nala had gone away, the beauteous<br>Damayanti, now refreshed, timorously awoke in that lonely forest. And O<br>mighty monarch, not finding her lord Naishadha, afflicted with grief and<br>pain, she shrieked aloud in fright, saying, 'O lord? O mighty monarch! O<br>husband, dost thou desert me? Oh, I am lost and undone, frightened in<br>this desolate place. O illustrious prince, thou art truthful in speech,<br>and conversant with morality. How hast thou then, having pledged thy<br>word, deserted me asleep in the woods? Oh, why hast thou deserted thy<br>accomplished wife, even devoted to thee, particularly one that hath not<br>wronged thee, though wronged thou hast been by others? O king of men, it<br>behoveth thee to act faithfull, according to those words thou hadst<br>spoken unto me before in the presence of the guardians of the worlds. O<br>bull among men, that thy wife liveth even a moment after thy desertion of<br>her, is only because mortals are decreed to die at the appointed time. O<br>bull among men, enough of this joke! O irrepressible one, I am terribly<br>frightened. O lord, show thyself. I see thee! I see thee, o king! Thou<br>art seen, O Naishadha, Hiding thyself behind those shrubs, why dost thou<br>not reply unto me? It is cruel of thee, O great king, that seeing me in<br>this plight and so lamenting, thou dost not, O king, approach and comfort<br>me. I grieve not for myself, nor for anything else. I only grieve to<br>think how thou wilt pass thy days alone, O king. In the evening oppressed<br>with hunger and thirst and fatigue, underneath the trees, how wilt it<br>take with thee when thou seest me not?' And then Damayanti, afflicted<br>with anguish and burning with grief, began to rush hither and thither,<br>weeping in woe. And now the helpless princess sprang up, and now she sank<br>down in stupor; and now she shrank in terror, and now she wept and wailed<br>aloud. And Bhima's daughter devoted to her husband, burning in anguish<br>and sighing ever more, and faint and weeping exclaimed, 'That being<br>through whose imprecation the afflicted Naishadha suffereth this woe,<br>shall bear grief that is greater than ours. May that wicked being who<br>hath brought Nala of sinless heart this, lead a more miserable life<br>bearing greater ills.'<br><br>"Thus lamenting, the crowned consort of the illustrious (king) began to<br>seek her lord in those woods, inhabited by beasts of prey. And the<br>daughter of Bhima, wailing bitterly, wandered hither and thither like a<br>maniac, exclaiming, 'Alas! Alas! Oh king!' And as she was wailing loudly<br>like a female osprey, and grieving and indulging in piteous lamentations<br>unceasingly, she came near a gigantic serpent. And that huge and hungry<br>serpent thereupon suddenly seized Bhima's daughter, who had come near and<br>was moving about within its range. And folded within serpent's coils and<br>filled with grief, she still wept, not for herself but for Naishadha. And<br>she said 'O lord, why dost thou not rush towards me, now that I am<br>seized, without anybody to protect me, by this serpent in these desert<br>wilds? And, O Naishadha, how will it fare with thee when thou rememberest<br>me? O lord, why hast thou gone away, deserting me today in the forest?<br>Free from thy course, when thou wilt have regained thy mind and senses<br>and wealth, how will it be with thee when thou thinkest of me? O<br>Naishadha, O sinless one, who will soothe thee when thou art weary, and<br>hungry, and fainting, O tiger among kings?' And while she was wailing<br>thus, a certain huntsman ranging the deep woods, hearing her<br>lamentations, swiftly came to the spot. And beholding the large-eyed one<br>in the coils of the serpent, he rushed towards it and cut off its head<br>with his sharp weapon. And having struck the reptile dead, the huntsman<br>set Damayanti free. And having sprinkled her body with water and fed and<br>comforted her. O Bharata, he addressed her saying, 'O thou with eyes like<br>those of a young gazelle, who art thou? And why also hast thou come into<br>the woods? And, O beauteous one, how hast thou fallen into this extreme<br>misery' And thus accosted, O monarch, by that man, Damayanti, O Bharata,<br>related unto him all that had happened. And beholding that beautiful<br>woman clad in half a garment, with deep bosom and round hips, and limbs<br>delicate and faultless, and face resembling the full moon, and eyes<br>graced with curved eye-lashes, and speech sweet as honey, the hunter<br>became inflamed with desire. And afflicted by the god of love, the<br>huntsman began to soothe her in winning voice and soft words. And as soon<br>as the chaste and beauteous Damayanti, beholding him understood his<br>intentions, she was filled with fierce wrath and seemed to blaze up in<br>anger. But the wicked-minded wretch, burning with desire became wroth,<br>attempted to employ force upon her, who was unconquerable as a flame of<br>blazing fire. And Damayanti already distressed upon being deprived of<br>husband and kingdom, in that hour of grief beyond utterance, cursed him<br>in anger, saying, 'I have never even thought of any other person than<br>Naishadha, therefore let this mean-minded wrath subsisting on chase, fall<br>down lifeless.' And as soon as she said this, the hunter fell down<br>lifeless upon the ground, like a tree consumed by fire." 131
