                            "Yudhishthira said, 'In this world, you are so learned in the Vedas and<br>Vedangas; tell me (then), what one should do to attain salvation?'<br><br>"The serpent replied, 'O scion of the Bharata's race, my belief is that<br>the man who bestows alms on proper objects, speaks kind words and tells<br>the truth and abstains from doing injury to any creature goes to heaven.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira enquired, 'Which, O snake, is the higher of the two, truth<br>or alms-giving? Tell me also the greater or less importance of kind<br>behaviour and of doing injury to no creature.'<br><br>"The snake replied, 'The relative merits of these virtues, truth and<br>alms-giving, kind speech and abstention from injury to any creature, are<br>known (measured) by their objective gravity (utility). Truth is<br>(sometimes) more praiseworthy than some acts of charity; some of the<br>latter again are more commendable than true speech. Similarly, O mighty<br>king, and lord of the earth, abstention from doing injury to any creature<br>is seen to be important than good speech and vice-versa. Even so it is, O<br>king, depending on effects. And now, if thou hast anything else to ask,<br>say it all, I shall enlighten thee!' Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O<br>snake, how the incorporal being's translation to heaven, its perception<br>by the senses and its enjoyment of the immutable fruits of its actions<br>(here below), can be comprehended.' The snake replied, 'By his own acts,<br>man is seen to attain to one of the three conditions of human existence,<br>of heavenly life, or of birth in the lower animal kingdom. Among these,<br>the man who is not slothful, who injures no one and who is endowed with<br>charity and other virtues, goes to heaven, after leaving this world of<br>men. By doing the very contrary, O king, people are again born as men or<br>as lower animals. O my son, it is particularly said in this connection,<br>that the man who is swayed by anger and lust and who is given to avarice<br>and malice falls away from his human state and is born again as a lower<br>animal, and the lower animals too are ordained to be transformed into the<br>human state; and the cow, the horse and other animals are observed to<br>attain to even the divine state.'[43] O my son, the sentient being,<br>reaping the fruits of his actions, thus transmigrates through these<br>conditions; but the regenerate and wise man reposes his soul in the<br>everlasting Supreme Spirit. The embodied spirit, enchained by destiny and<br>reaping the fruits of its own actions, thus undergoes birth after birth<br>but he that has lost touch of his actions, is conscious of the immutable<br>destiny of all born beings.[44]<br><br>"Yudhishthira asked, 'O snake, tell me truly and without confusion how<br>that dissociated spirit becomes cognisant of sound, touch, form, flavour,<br>and taste. O great-minded one, dost thou not perceive them,<br>simultaneously by the senses? Do thou, O best of snakes, answer all these<br>queries!' The snake replied, 'O long-lived one, the thing called Atman<br>(spirit), betaking itself to corporeal tenement and manifesting itself<br>through the organs of sense, becomes duly cognisant of perceptible<br>objects. O prince of Bharata's race, know that the senses, the mind, and<br>the intellect, assisting the soul in its perception of objects, are<br>called Karanas. O my son, the eternal spirit, going out of its sphere,<br>and aided by the mind, acting through the senses, the receptacles of all<br>perceptions, successively perceives these things (sound, form, flavour,<br>&c). O most valiant of men, the mind of living creatures is the cause of<br>all perception, and, therefore, it cannot be cognisant of more than one<br>thing at a time. That spirit, O foremost of men, betaking itself to the<br>space between the eyebrows, sends the high and low intellect to different<br>objects. What the Yogins perceive after the action of the intelligent<br>principle by that is manifested the action of the soul.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me the distinguishing characteristics of the<br>mind and the intellect. The knowledge of it is ordained as the chief duty<br>of persons meditating on the Supreme Spirit.'<br><br>"The snake replied, 'Through illusion, the soul becomes subservient to<br>the intellect. The intellect, though known to be subservient to the soul,<br>becomes (then) the director of the latter. The intellect is brought into<br>play by acts of perception; the mind is self-existent. The Intellect does<br>not cause the sensation (as of pain, pleasure, &c), but the mind does.<br>This, my son, is the difference between the mind and the intellect. You<br>too are learned in this matter, what is your opinion?'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O most intelligent one, you have fine intelligence<br>and you know all that is fit to be known. Why do you ask me that<br>question? You knew all and you performed such wonderful deeds and you<br>lived in heaven. How could then illusion overpower you? Great is my doubt<br>on this point.' The snake replied, 'Prosperity intoxicates even the wise<br>and valiant men. Those who live in luxury, (soon) lose their reason. So,<br>I too, O Yudhishthira, overpowered by the infatuation of prosperity, have<br>fallen from my high state and having recovered my self-consciousness, am<br>enlightening thee thus! O victorious king, thou hast done me a good turn.<br>By conversing with thy pious self, my painful curse has been expiated. In<br>days of yore, while I used to sojourn in heaven in a celestial chariot,<br>revelling in my pride, I did not think of anything else, I used to exact<br>tribute from Brahmarshis, Devas, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Rakshasas, Pannagas<br>and all other dwellers of the three worlds. O lord of earth, such was the<br>spell of my eyes, that on whatever creature, I fixed them, I instantly<br>destroyed his power. Thousands of Brahmarshis used to draw my chariot.<br>The delinquency, O king, was the cause of my fall from my high<br>prosperity. Among them, Agastya was one day drawing my conveyance, and my<br>feet came in contact with his body; Agastya then pronounced (this curse)<br>on me, in anger, 'Ruin seize thee, do thou become a snake.' So, losing my<br>glory, I fell down from that excellent car and while falling, I beheld<br>myself turned into a snake, with head downwards. I thus implored that<br>Brahmana, 'May this curse be extinguished, O adorable one! You ought to<br>forgive one who has been so foolish from infatuation.' Then he kindly<br>told me this, as I was being hurled down (from heaven), "The virtuous<br>king Yudhishthira will save thee from this curse, and when, O king,<br>horrible sin of pride will be extinguished in thee; thou shalt attain<br>salvation.' And I was struck with wonder on seeing (this) power of his<br>austere virtues; and therefore, have I questioned thee about the<br>attributes of the Supreme Spirit and of Brahmanas. Truth, charity,<br>self-restraint, penance, abstention from doing injury to any creature,<br>and constancy in virtue, these, O king, and not his race of family<br>connections, are the means, by which a man must always secure salvation.<br>May this brother of thine, the mighty Bhimasena, meet with good luck and<br>may happiness abide with thee! I must go to Heaven again.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "So saying, that king, Nahusha, quitted his<br>serpentine form, and assuming his celestial shape he went back to Heaven.<br>The glorious and pious Yudhishthira, too, returned to his hermitage with<br>Dhaumya and his brother Bhima. Then the virtuous Yudhishthira narrated<br>all that, in detail, to the Brahmanas who had assembled (there). On<br>hearing that, his three brothers and all the Brahmanas and the renowned<br>Draupadi too were covered with shame. And all those excellent Brahmanas<br>desiring the welfare of the Pandavas, admonished Bhima for his<br>foolhardiness, telling him not to attempt such things again, and the<br>Pandavas too were greatly pleased at seeing the mighty Bhima out of<br>danger, and continued to live there pleasantly."
