                            "Markandeya said, 'It was on the breast of that very hill where Rama was<br>seated with those foremost of monkeys that great monkey chiefs at the<br>command of Sugriva, began to flock together. The father-in-law of Vali,<br>the illustrious Sushena, accompanied by a thousand crores of active apes,<br>came to Rama. And those two foremost of monkeys endued with mighty<br>energy, viz., Gaya and Gavakshya, each accompanied by a hundred crores of<br>monkeys, showed themselves there. And, O king, Gavakshya also of terrible<br>mien and endued with a bovine tail, showed himself there, having<br>collected sixty thousand crores of monkeys. And the renowned<br>Gandhamadana, dwelling on the mountains of the same name, collected a<br>hundred thousand crores of monkeys. And the intelligent and mighty monkey<br>known by the name of Panasa mustered together fifty-two crores of<br>monkeys.[94] And that foremost and illustrious of monkeys named<br>Dadhimukha of mighty energy mustered a large army of monkeys possessed of<br>terrible prowess. And Jamvuvan showed himself there with a hundred<br>thousand crores of black bears of terrible deeds and faces having the<br>Tilaka mark.[95] And these and many other chiefs of monkey-chiefs,<br>countless in number, O king, came there for aiding Rama's cause. And<br>endued with bodies huge as mountain-peaks and roaring like lions, loud<br>was the uproar that was heard there made by those monkeys running<br>restlessly from place to place. And some of them looked like<br>mountain-peaks, and some looked like buffaloes. And some were of the hue<br>of autumnal clouds and the faces of some were red as vermillion. And some<br>rose high, and some fell down, and some cut capers, and some scattered<br>the dust, as they mustered together from various directions. And that<br>monkey army, vast as the sea at full tide, encamped there at Sugriva's<br>bidding. And after those foremost of monkeys had mustered from every<br>direction, the illustrious descendant of Raghu, with Sugriva by his side,<br>set out in an auspicious moment of a very fair day under a lucky<br>constellation, accompanied by that host arrayed in order of battle, as if<br>for the purpose of destroying all the worlds. And Hanuman, the son of the<br>Wind-god, was in the van of that host, while the rear was protected by<br>the fearless son of Sumitra. And surrounded by the monkey-chiefs, those<br>princes of Raghu's house with fingers cased in guana skin, shone, as they<br>went, like the Sun and the Moon in the midst of the planets. And that<br>monkey host armed with stones and Sala and Tala trees, looked very much<br>like a far-extending field of corn under the morning sun. And that mighty<br>army, protected by Nala and Nila and Angada and Kratha and Mainda and<br>Dwivida, marched forth for achieving the purpose of Raghava. And<br>encamping successively, without interruption of any kind, on wide and<br>healthy tracts and valleys abounding with fruits and roots and water and<br>honey and meat, the monkey host at last reached the shores of the briny<br>sea. And like unto a second ocean, that mighty army with its countless<br>colours, having reached the shores of sea, took up its abode there. Then<br>the illustrious son of Dasaratha, addressing Sugriva amongst all those<br>foremost monkeys, spoke unto him these words that were suited to the<br>occasion, 'This army is large. The ocean also is difficult to cross. What<br>contrivance, therefore, commends itself to thee for crossing the ocean?'<br>At these words, many vain-glorious monkeys answered, 'We are fully able<br>to cross the sea.' This answer, however, was not of much use, as all<br>could not avail of that means. Some of the monkeys proposed to cross the<br>sea in boats, and some in rafts of various kinds. Rama, however,<br>conciliating them all, said, 'This cannot be. 'The sea here is a full<br>hundred Yojanas in width. All the monkeys, ye heroes, will not be able to<br>cross it. This proposal, therefore, that ye have made, is not consonant<br>to reason. Besides we have not the number of boats necessary for carrying<br>all our troops. How, again, can one like us raise such obstacles in the<br>way of the merchants? Our army is very large. The foe wilt make a great<br>havoc if a hole is detected. Therefore, to cross the sea in boats and<br>rafts doth not recommend itself to me. I will, however, pray to the Ocean<br>for the necessary means. Foregoing food, I will lie down on the shore. He<br>will certainly show himself to me. If, however, he doth not show himself,<br>I will chastise him then by means of my great weapons that are more<br>blazing than fire itself and are incapable of being baffled!' Having said<br>these words, both Rama and Lakshmana touched water[96] and duly laid<br>themselves down on a bed of kusa grass on the seashore. The divine and<br>illustrious Ocean then that lord of male and female rivers, surrounded by<br>aquatic animals, appeared unto Rama in a vision. And addressing Rama in<br>sweet accents, the genius of the Ocean, surrounded by countless mines of<br>gems, said, 'O son of Kausalya, tell me what aid, O bull among men, I am<br>to render thee! I also have sprung from the race of Ikshwaku[97] and am,<br>therefore, a relative of thine!' Rama replied unto him, saying, 'O lord<br>of rivers, male and female, I desire thee to grant me a way for my<br>troops, passing along which I may slay the Ten-headed (Ravana), that<br>wretch of Pulastya's race! If thou dost not grant the way I beg of thee,<br>I will then dry thee up by means of my celestial arrows inspired with<br>mantras!' And hearing these words of Rama, the genius of Varuna's abode,<br>joining his hands, answered in great affliction, 'I do not desire to put<br>any obstacle in thy way. I am no foe of thine! Listen, O Rama, to these<br>words, and having listened, do what is proper! If, at thy command, I get<br>a way for the passage of thy army, others then, from strength of their<br>bows, will command me to do the same! In thy army there is a monkey of<br>the name of Nala, who is a skilful mechanic. And endued with great<br>strength, Nala is the son of Tashtri, the divine artificer of the<br>Universe. And whether it is wood, or grass or stone, that he will throw<br>into my waters, I will support the same on my surface, and thus wilt thou<br>have a bridge (over which to pass)!' And having said these words, the<br>genius of the Ocean disappeared. And Rama awaking, called Nala unto him<br>and said, 'Build thou a bridge over the sea! Thou alone, I am sure, art<br>able to do it!' And it was by this means that the descendant of<br>Kakutstha's race caused a bridge to be built that was ten Yojanas in<br>width and a hundred Yojanas in length. And to this day that bridge is<br>celebrated over all the world by the name of Nala's bridge. And having<br>completed that bridge, Nala, of body huge as a hill, came away at the<br>command of Rama.<br><br>"And while Rama was on this side of the ocean, the virtuous Vibhishana,<br>the brother of the king of the Rakshasas accompanied by four of his<br>counsellors, came unto Rama. And the high-souled Rama received him with<br>due welcome. Sugriva, however, feared, thinking he might be a spy. The<br>son of Raghu, meanwhile perfectly satisfied (with Vibhishana) in<br>consequence of the sincerity of his exertions and the many indications of<br>his good conduct, worshipped him with respect. And he also installed<br>Vibhishana in the sovereignty of all the Rakshasas and made him his own<br>junior counsellor, and a friend of Lakshmana's. And it was under<br>Vibhishana's guidance, O king, that Rama with all his troops crossed the<br>great ocean by means of that bridge in course of a month. And having<br>crossed the ocean and arrived at Lanka, Rama caused its extensive and<br>numerous gardens to be devastated by his monkeys. And while Rama's troops<br>were there, two of Ravana's counsellors and officers, named Suka and<br>Sarana, who had come as spies, having assumed the shape of monkeys, were<br>seized by Vibhishana. And when those wanderers of the night assumed their<br>real Rakshasa forms, Rama showed them his troop and dismissed them<br>quietly. And having quartered his troops in those woods that skirted the<br>city, Rama then sent the monkey Angada with great wisdom as his envoy to<br>Ravana."
