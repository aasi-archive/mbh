                            Vaisampayana said, "The hostile Kshatriyas, incensed at sight of<br>Bhimasena and Arjuna, sent up a loud shout in the forest. And the wicked<br>king Jayadratha, when he saw the standards of those bulls of the Kuru<br>race, lost his heart, and addressing the resplendent Yagnaseni seated on<br>his car, said, 'Those five great warriors, O Krishna, that are coming,<br>are I believe, thy husbands. As thou knowest the sons of Pandu well, do<br>thou, O lady of beautiful tresses, describe them one by one to us,<br>pointing out which of them rideth which car!' Thus addressed, Draupadi<br>replied, 'Having done this violent deed calculated to shorten thy life,<br>what will it avail thee now, O fool, to know the names of those great<br>warriors, for, now that my heroic husbands are come, not one of ye will<br>be left alive in battle. However as thou art on the point of death and<br>hast asked me, I will tell thee everything, this being consistent with<br>the ordinance. Beholding king Yudhishthira the just with his younger<br>brothers, I have not the slighest anxiety or fear from thee! That warrior<br>at the top of whose flagstaff two handsome and sonorous tabours called<br>Nanda and Upananda are constantly played upon,&#8212;he, O Sauvira chief, hath<br>a correct knowledge of the morality of his own acts. Men that have<br>attained success always walk in his train. With a complexion like that of<br>pure gold, possessed of a prominent nose and large eyes, and endued with<br>a slender make, that husband of mine is known among people by the name of<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma and the foremost of the Kuru race. That<br>virtuous prince of men granteth life to even a foe that yields.<br>Therefore, O fool, throwing down thy arms and joining thy hands, run to<br>him for thy good, to seek his protection. And that other man whom thou<br>seest with long arms and tall as the full-grown Sala tree, seated on his<br>chariot, biting his lips, and contracting his forehead so as to bring the<br>two eye-brows together, is he,&#8212;my husband Vrikodara! Steeds of the<br>noblest breed, plump and strong, well-trained and endued with great<br>might, draw the cars of that warrior! His achievements are superhuman. He<br>is known, therefore, by the name of Bhima on earth. They that offend him<br>are never suffered to live. He never forgetteth a foe. On some pretext or<br>other he wrecketh his vengeance. Nor is he pacified even after he has<br>wrecked a signal vengeance. And there, that foremost of bowmen, endued<br>with intelligence and renown, with senses under complete control and<br>reverence for the old&#8212;that brother and disciple of Yudhishthira&#8212;is my<br>husband Dhananjaya! Virtue he never forsaketh, from lust or fear or<br>anger! Nor doth he ever commit a deed that is cruel. Endued with the<br>energy of fire and capable of withstanding every foe, that grinder of<br>enemies is the son of Kunti. And that other youth, versed in every<br>question of morality and profit, who ever dispelleth the fears of the<br>affrighted, who is endued with high wisdom, who is considered as the<br>handsomest person in the whole world and who is protected by all the sons<br>of Pandu, being regarded by them as dearer to them than their own lives<br>for his unflinching devotion to them, is my husband Nakula possessed of<br>great prowess. Endued with high wisdom and having Sahadeva for his<br>second, possessed of exceeding lightness of hand, he fighteth with the<br>sword, making dexterous passes therewith. Thou, foolish man, shall<br>witness today his performances on the field of battle, like unto those of<br>Indra amid the ranks of Daityas! And that hero skilled in weapons and<br>possessed of intelligence and wisdom, and intent on doing what is<br>agreeable to the son of Dharma, that favourite and youngest born of the<br>Pandavas, is my husband Sahadeva! Heroic, intelligent, wise and ever<br>wrathful there is not another man equal unto him in intelligence or in<br>eloquence amid assemblies of the wise. Dearer to Kunti than her own soul,<br>he is always mindful of the duties of Kshatriyas, and would much sooner<br>rush into fire or sacrifice his own life than say anything that is<br>opposed to religion and morals. When the sons of Pandu will have killed<br>thy warriors in battle, then wilt thou behold thy army in the miserable<br>plight of a ship on the sea wrecked with its freight of jewels on the<br>back of a whale. Thus have I described unto thee the prowess of the sons<br>of Pandu, disregarding whom in thy foolishness, thou hast acted so. If<br>thou escapest unscathed from them, then, indeed thou wilt have obtained a<br>new lease of life.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Then those five sons of Pritha, each like unto<br>Indra, filled with wrath, leaving the panic-stricken infantry alone who<br>were imploring them for mercy, rushed furiously upon the charioteers,<br>attacking them on all sides and darkening the very air with the thick<br>shower of arrows they shot."
