                            Janamejaya said, "How was it, O sage! that Bhima, of mighty prowess and<br>possessing the strength of ten thousand elephants, was stricken with<br>panic at (the sight of) that snake? Thou hast described him, that slayer<br>of his enemies, as dismayed and appalled with fear, even him, who by<br>fighting at the lotus lake (of Kuvera) became the destroyer of Yakshas<br>and Rakshasas and who, in proud defiance, invited to a single combat,<br>Pulastya's son, the dispenser of all riches. I desire to hear this (from<br>you); great indeed is my curiosity."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "O king, having reached king Vrishaparva's<br>hermitage, while those fearful warriors were living in various wonderful<br>woods, Vrikodara roaming at pleasure, with bow in hand and armed with a<br>scimitar, found that beautiful forest, frequented by gods and Gandharvas.<br>And then he beheld (some) lovely spots in the Himalayan mountains,<br>frequented by Devarshis and Siddhas and inhabited by hosts of Apsaras,<br>resounded here and there with (the warbling of) birds&#8212;the chakora, the<br>chakrabaka, the jibajibaka and the cuckoo and the Bhringaraja, and<br>abounding with shady trees, soft with the touch of snow and pleasing to<br>the eye and mind, and bearing perennial fruits and flowers. And he beheld<br>mountain streams with waters glistening like the lapis lazuli and with<br>ten thousand snow-white ducks and swans and with forests of deodar trees<br>forming (as it were) a trap for the clouds; and with tugna and kalikaya<br>forests, interspersed with yellow sandal trees. And he of mighty<br>strength, in the pursuit of the chase, roamed in the level and desert<br>tracts of the mountain, piercing his game with unpoisoned arrows. In that<br>forest the famous and mighty Bhimasena, possessing the strength of a<br>hundred elephants, killed (many) large wild boars, with the force (of his<br>arms). And endowed with terrible prowess and mighty strength, and<br>powerful as the lion or the tiger, and capable of resisting a hundred<br>men, and having long arms, and possessing the strength of a hundred<br>elephants, he killed many antelopes and wild boars and buffaloes. And<br>here and there, in that forest he pulled out trees by the roots, with<br>great violence and broke them too, causing the earth and the woods and<br>the (surrounding) places to resound. And then shouting and trampling on<br>the tops of mountains, and causing the earth to resound with his roars,<br>and striking his arms, and uttering his war-cry, and slapping and<br>clapping his hands, Bhimasena, exempt from decay, and ever-proud and<br>without fear, again and again leaped about in those woods. And on hearing<br>the shouts of Bhimasena, powerful lions and elephants of huge strength,<br>left their lairs in fright. And in that same forest, he fearlessly<br>strolled about in search of game; and like the denizens of the woods,<br>that most valiant of men, the mighty Bhimasena, wandered on foot in that<br>forest. And he penetrated the vast forest, shouting strange whoopos, and<br>terrifying all creatures, endowed with strength and prowess. And then<br>being terrified, the snakes hid (themselves) in caves, but he, overtaking<br>them with promptitude, pursued them slowly. Then the mighty Bhimasena,<br>like unto the Lord of the Celestials, saw a serpent of colossal<br>proportions, living in one of the mountain fastnesses and covering the<br>(entire) cave with its body and causing one's hair to stand on end (from<br>fright). It had its huge body stretched like a hillock, and it possessed<br>gigantic strength, and its body was speckled with spots and it had a<br>turmeric-like (yellow) colour and a deep copper-coloured mouth of the<br>form of a cave supplied with four teeth; and with glaring eyes, it was<br>constantly licking the corners of its mouth. And it was the terror of all<br>animated beings and it looked like the very image of the Destroyer Yama;<br>and with the hissing noise of its breath it lay as if rebuking (an<br>in-comer). And seeing Bhima draw so near to him, the serpent, all on a<br>sudden, became greatly enraged, and that goat-devouring snake violently<br>seized Bhimasena in his grip. Then by virtue of the boon that had been<br>received by the serpent, Bhimasena with his body in the serpent's grip,<br>instantly lost all consciousness. Unrivalled by that of others, the might<br>of Bhimasena's arms equalled the might of ten thousand elephants<br>combined. But Bhima, of great prowess, being thus vanquished by the<br>snake, trembled slowly, and was unable to exert himself. And that one of<br>mighty arms and of leonine shoulders, though possessed of strength often<br>thousand elephants, yet seized by the snake, and overpowered by virtue of<br>the boon, lost all strength. He struggled furiously to extricate himself,<br>but did not succeed in any wise baffling this (snake)."
