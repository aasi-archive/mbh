                            "Vrihadaswa continued, 'Having heard the words of Sudeva king Rituparna,<br>soothing Vahuka with gentle words, said, 'O Vahuka, thou art well-skilled<br>in training and guiding horses. If it pleases thee, I intend to go to<br>Damayanti's Swayamvara in course of a single day.' Thus addressed, O son<br>of Kunti, by that king, Nala felt his heart to be bursting in grief. And<br>the high-souled king seemed to burn in sorrow. And he thought within<br>himself, 'Perhaps Damayanti in doing this is blinded by sorrow. Or,<br>perhaps, she hath conceived this magnificent scheme for my sake. Alas,<br>cruel is the deed that the innocent princess of Vidarbha intends to do,<br>having been deceived by my sinful and low self of little sense. It is<br>seen in the world that the nature of woman is inconstant. My offence also<br>hath been great; perhaps she is acting so, because she hath no longer any<br>love for me owing to my separation from her. Indeed, that girl of slender<br>waist, afflicted with grief on my account and with despair, will not<br>certainly do anything of the kind, when especially, she is the mother of<br>offspring (by me). However whether this is true or false, I shall<br>ascertain with certitude by going thither. I will, therefore, accomplish<br>Rituparna's and my own purpose also.' Having resolved thus in his mind,<br>Vahuka, with his heart in sorrow, spake unto king Rituparna, with joined<br>hands, saying, 'O monarch, I bow to thy behest, and, O tiger among men, I<br>will go to the city of the Vidarbhas in a single day. O king!' Then, O<br>monarch, at the command of the royal son of Bhangasura, Vahuka went to<br>the stables and began to examine the horses. And repeatedly urged by<br>Rituparna to make haste, Vahuka after much scrutiny and careful<br>deliberation, selected some steeds that were lean-fleshed, yet strong and<br>capable of a long journey and endued with energy and strength of high<br>breed and docility, free from inauspicious marks, with wide nostrils and<br>swelling cheeks, free from faults as regards the ten hairy curls, born in<br>(the country of) Sindhu, and fleet as the winds. And seeing those horses,<br>the king said somewhat angrily, 'What is this, that thou wishest to do?<br>Thou shouldst not jest with us. How can these horses of mine, weak in<br>strength and breath, carry us? And how shall we be able to go this long<br>way by help of these?' Vahuka replied, 'Each of these horses bears one<br>curl on his forehead, two on his temples, four on his sides, four on his<br>chest, and one on his back. Without doubt, these steeds will be able to<br>go to the country of the Vidarbhas. If, O king, thou thinkest of choosing<br>others, point them out and I shall yoke them for thee.' Rituparna<br>rejoined, 'O Vahuka, thou art versed in the science of horses and art<br>also skillful (in guiding them). Do thou speedily yoke those that thou<br>thinkest to be able.' Thereupon the skillful Nala yoked upon the car four<br>excellent steeds of good breed that were, besides, docile and fleet. And<br>after the steeds had been yoked, the king without loss of time mounted<br>upon the car, when those best of horses fell down upon the ground on<br>their knees. Then, O king, that foremost of men, the blessed king Nala<br>began to soothe horses endued with energy and strength. And raising them<br>up with the reins and making the charioteer Varshneya sit on the car, he<br>prepared to set out with great speed. And those best of steeds, duly<br>urged by Vahuka, rose to the sky, confounding the occupant of the<br>vehicle. And beholding those steeds gifted with the speed of the wind<br>thus drawing the car, the blessed king of Ayodhaya was exceedingly<br>amazed. And noticing the rattle of the car and also the management of the<br>steeds, Varshneya reflected upon Vahuka's skill in guiding horses. And he<br>thought, 'Is he Matali, the charioteer of the king of the celestials? I<br>find the same magnificent indications in the heroic Vahuka. Or, hath<br>Salihotra versed in the science of horses taken this human shape so<br>beautiful? Or, is it king Nala the reducer of hostile towns that hath<br>come here? Or, it may be that this Vahuka knoweth the science that Nala<br>knoweth, for I perceive that the knowledge of Vahuka is equal to that of<br>Nala. Further, Vahuka and Nala are of the same age. This one, again, may<br>not be Nala of high prowess, but somebody of equal knowledge. Illustrious<br>persons, however, walk this earth in disguise in consequence of<br>misfortune, or agreeably to the ordinance of the scriptures. That this<br>person is of unsightly appearance need not change my opinion; for Nala, I<br>think, may even be despoiled of his personal features. In respect of age<br>this one equals Nala. There is difference, however, in personal<br>appearance. Vahuka, again is endued with every accomplishment. I think,<br>therefore, he is Nala.' Having thus reasoned long in his mind, O mighty<br>monarch, Varshneya, the (former) charioteer of the righteous Nala, became<br>absorbed in thought. And that foremost of kings Rituparna, also,<br>beholding the skill of Vahuka in equestrian science experienced great<br>delight, along with his charioteer Varshneya. And thinking of Vahuka's<br>application and ardour and the manner of his holding the reins, the king<br>felt exceedingly glad.'"
