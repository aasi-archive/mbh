                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O child, why dost thou use language such as this,<br>towards the frightened Kurus, who are now in adversity and who have come<br>to us, solicitous of protection! O Vrikodara, disunions and disputes do<br>take place amongst those that are connected in blood. Hostilities such as<br>these do go on. But the honour of the family is never suffered to be<br>interfered with. If any stranger seeketh to insult the honour of a<br>family, they that are good never tolerate such insult coming from the<br>stranger. The wicked-souled king of the Gandharvas knoweth that we are<br>living here from some time. Yet disregarding us, he hath done this deed<br>which is so disagreeable to us! O exalted one, from this forcible seizure<br>of Duryodhana and from this insult to the ladies of our house by a<br>stranger, our family honour is being destroyed. Therefore, ye tigers<br>among men, arise and arm yourselves without delay for rescuing those that<br>have sought our protection and for guarding the honour of our family. Ye<br>tigers among men, let Arjuna and the twins and thyself also that art<br>brave and unvanquished, liberate Duryodhana, who is even now being taken<br>away a captive! Ye foremost of warriors, these blazing cars, furnished<br>with golden flagstaff's and every kind of weapons belonging to<br>Dhritarashtra's sons, are ready here. With Indrasena and other<br>charioteers skilled in arms, for guiding them, ride ye on these<br>everfurnished cars of deep rattle! And riding on these, exert ye with<br>activity for fighting with the Gandharvas to liberate Duryodhana. Even an<br>ordinary Kashatriya (amongst those that are here), would to the height of<br>his power, protect one that hath come hither for refuge! What then, O<br>Vrikodara, shall I say of thee! Entreated for assistance in such words as<br>'O hasten to my aid!' Who is there (amongst those standing around me)<br>that is high-souled enough to assist even his foe, beholding him seeking<br>shelter with joined hands? The bestowal of a boon, sovereignty, and the<br>birth of a son are sources of great joy. But, ye sons of Pandu, the<br>liberation of a foe from distress is equal to all the three put together!<br>What can be a source of greater joy to you than that Duryodhana sunk in<br>distress seeketh his very life as depending on the might of your arms? O<br>Vrikodara, if the vow in which I am engaged had been over, there is<br>little doubt that I would myself have run to his aid. Strive thou by all<br>means, O Bharata, to liberate Duryodhana by the arts of conciliation. If,<br>however, the king of the Gandharvas cannot be managed by the arts of<br>conciliation, then must thou try to rescue Suyodhana by lightly<br>skirmishing with the foe. But if the chief of the Gandharvas do not let<br>the Kurus off even then, they must be rescued by crushing the foe by all<br>means. O Vrikodara, this is all I can tell thee now, for my vow hath been<br>begun and is not ended yet!"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Hearing these words of Ajatasatru, Dhananjaya<br>pledged himself, from respect for these commands of his superior, to<br>liberate the Kauravas. And Arjuna said, 'If the Gandharvas do not set the<br>Dhartarashtras free peacefully, the Earth shall this day drink the blood<br>of the king of the Gandharvas!' And hearing that pledge of the<br>truth-speaking Arjuna, the Kauravas then, O king, regained (the lost)<br>tenor of their minds."
