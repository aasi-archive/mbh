                            Markandeya continued, "O Bharata, the fowler having expounded these<br>abstruse points, the Brahmana with great attention again enquired of him<br>about these subtle topics. The Brahmana said, 'Do thou truly describe to<br>me, who now duly ask thee, the respective virtues of the qualities of<br>sattwa, rajas, and tamas.' The fowler replied, 'Very well, I shall tell<br>thee what thou hast asked. I shall describe separately their respective<br>virtues, do thou listen. Of them tamas is characterised by illusion<br>(spiritual), rajas incites (men to action), sattwa is of great grandeur,<br>and on that account, it is said to be the greatest of them. He who is<br>greatly under the influence of spiritual ignorance, who is foolish,<br>senseless and given to dreaming, who is idle, unenergetic and swayed by<br>anger and haughtiness, is said to be under the influence of tamas. And, O<br>Brahmana rishi, that excellent man who is agreeable in speech,<br>thoughtful, free from envy, industrious in action from an eager desire to<br>reap its fruits, and of warm temperament, is said to be under the<br>influence of rajas. And he who is resolute, patient, not subject to<br>anger, free from malice, and is not skilful in action from want of a<br>selfish desire to reap its fruits, wise and forbearing, is said to be<br>under the influence of sattwa. When a man endowed with the sattwa<br>quality, is influenced by worldliness, he suffers misery; but he hates<br>worldliness, when he realises its full significance. And then a feeling<br>of indifference to worldly affairs begins to influence him. And then his<br>pride decreases, and uprightness becomes more prominent, and his<br>conflicting moral sentiments are reconciled. And then self-restraint in<br>any matter becomes unnecessary. A man, O Brahmana, may be born in the<br>Sudra caste, but if he is possessed of good qualities, he may attain the<br>state of Vaisya and similarly that of a Kshatriya, and if he is steadfast<br>in rectitude, he may even become a Brahmana. I have described to thee<br>these virtues, what else dost thou wish to learn?'"
