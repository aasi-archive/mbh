                            (Tirtha-yatra Parva continued)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then, O Janamejaya, the son of Pandu started from<br>the river Kausiki and repaired in succession to all the sacred shrines.<br>And, O protector of men, he came to the sea where the river Ganga falls<br>into it; and there in the centre of five hundred rivers, he performed the<br>holy ceremony of a plunge. Then, O ruler of the earth, accompanied by his<br>brothers, the valiant prince proceeded by the shore of the sea towards<br>the land where the Kalinga tribes dwell."<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'There is the land, O Kunti's son, where the Kalinga tribes<br>dwell. Through it passeth the river Vaitarani, on the banks whereof even<br>the god of virtue performed religious river, having first placed himself<br>under the protection of the celestials. Verily, this is the northern<br>bank, inhabited by saints, suitable for the performance of religious<br>rites beautified by a hill, and frequented by persons of the regenerate<br>caste. This spot (in holiness) rivals the path whereby a virtuous man,<br>fit for going to heaven, repairs to the region inhabited by gods. And<br>verily at this spot in former times, other saints likewise worshipped the<br>immortals by the performance of religious rites. And at the very spot it<br>was that the god Rudra, O king of kings, seized the sacrificial beast and<br>exclaimed, 'This is my share!' O chief of the descendants of Bharata,<br>then when the beast was carried away by Siva, the gods spake to him<br>saying, 'Cast not a covetous glance at the property of others,<br>disregarding all the righteous rules.' Then they addressed words of<br>glorification of a pleasing kind to the god Rudra. And they satisfied him<br>by offering a sacrifice, and paid him suitable honours. Thereupon he gave<br>up the beast, and went by the path trodden by the gods. Thereupon what<br>happened to Rudra, learn from me, O Yudhishthira! Influenced by the dread<br>of Rudra, the gods set apart for evermore, the best allotment out of all<br>shares, such as was fresh and not stale (to be appropriated by the god).<br>Whosoever performs his ablutions at this spot, while reciting this<br>ancient story, beholds with his mortal eyes the path that leads to the<br>region of the gods.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then all the sons of Pandu and likewise the daughter<br>of Drupada&#8212;all of whom were the favoured of Fate&#8212;descended to the river<br>Vaitarani, and made libations to the names of their fathers.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O Lomasa, how great must be the force of a pious<br>deed! Having taken my bath at this spot in a proper form, I seem to touch<br>no more the region inhabited by mortal men! O saint of a virtuous life, I<br>am beholding all the regions. And this is the noise of the magnanimous<br>dwellers of the wood, who are reciting their audible prayers.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'O Yudhishthira, the place whence this noise comes and<br>reaches thy ears is at the distance of three hundred thousand yojanas, to<br>be sure. O lord of men, rest thou quiet and utter no word. O king, this<br>is the divine forest of the Self-existent One, which hath now come to our<br>view. There, O king, Viswakarma of a dreaded name performed religious<br>rites. On the mighty occasion of that sacrifice, the Self-existent One<br>made a gift of this entire earth with all its hilly and forest tracts, to<br>Kasyapa, by way of gratuity, for ministering as a priest. And then, O<br>Kuru's son, as soon as that goddess Earth was giving away, she became sad<br>at heart, and wrathfully spake the following words to that great lord,<br>the ruler of the worlds, 'O mighty god, it is unworthy of thee to give me<br>away to an ordinary mortal. And this act of gift on thy part will come to<br>nothing; (for) here am I going to descend into the bottom of the nether<br>world.' Then when the blessed saint Kasyapa beheld the goddess Earth,<br>despondent and sad, he, O protector of men, performed a propitiatory act<br>calculated to appease her wrath. And then, O Pandu's son, the Earth was<br>pleased with his pious deed. And she uprose again from within the waters,<br>and showed herself in the form of a sacred altar. This, O king, is the<br>spot which distinctly manifests the form of an altar. O great monarch,<br>ascend over it, and thou wilt gain valour and strength. And, O king, this<br>is the very altar which reaches as far as the sea, and rests itself upon<br>its bosom. May good luck be thine, do thou mount hereupon, and of thyself<br>cross the sea. And while thou this day mountest upon it, I shall<br>administer the ceremony for averting all evil from thee; for this altar<br>here, as soon as it gets a mortal's touch, at once enters into the sea.<br>Salutation to the god who protects the universe! Salutation to thee that<br>art beyond the universe! O Lord of gods, vouchsafe thy presence in this<br>sea. O Pandu's son, thou must recite the following words of truth, and<br>while so reciting, thou must quickly ascend this altar, 'The god of fire,<br>and the sun, and the organ of generation, and water, and goddess and the<br>seed of Vishnu, and the navel of nectar. The god of fire is the organ<br>that generated the (ocean); the earth is thy body; Vishnu deposited the<br>seed that caused thy being and thou art the navel of nectar.' Thus, O<br>Pandu's son, the words of truth must be audibly recited, and while so<br>reciting, one must plunge into the lord of rivers. O most praiseworthy of<br>Kunti's son, otherwise this lord of waters of divine birth, this best<br>storehouse of the waters (of the earth), should not be touched, O son of<br>Kunti, even with the end of a sacred grass.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then when the ceremony for averting evil had been<br>completed in his behalf, the magnanimous Yudhishthira went into the sea,<br>and having performed all that the saint had bid, repaired to the skirts<br>of the Mahendra hill, and spent the night at that spot.'"
