                            (Kairata Parva)<br><br>Janemejaya said, "O illustrious one, I desire to hear in detail the<br>history of the acquisition of weapons by Arjuna of spotless deeds. O tell<br>me how that tiger among men, Dhananjaya, of mighty arms and possessed of<br>great energy, entered that solitary forest without fear. And, O thou<br>foremost of those acquainted with the Veda, what also did Arjuna do while<br>dwelling there? How also were the illustrious Sthanu and the chief of the<br>celestials gratified by him? O thou best of regenerate ones, I desire to<br>hear all this under thy favour. Thou art omniscient; thou knowest all<br>about the gods and all about men. O Brahmana, the battle that took place<br>of old between Arjuna&#8212;that foremost of smiters never defeated in<br>battle&#8212;and Bhava was highly extraordinary and without parallel. It<br>maketh one's hair stand on end to hear of it. Even the hearts of those<br>lions among men&#8212;the brave sons of Pritha&#8212;trembled in consequence of<br>wonder and joy and a sense of their own inferiority. O tell me in full<br>what else Arjuna, did I do not see even the most trivial thing to Jishnu<br>that is censurable. Therefore, recite to me in full the history of that<br>hero."<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "O tiger among Kurus, I shall recite to thee that<br>narration, excellent and extensive and unrivalled, in connection with the<br>illustrious hero. O sinless one, hear in detail the particulars about<br>Arjuna's meeting with the three-eyed god of gods, and his contact with<br>the illustrious god's person!<br><br>"At Yudhishthira's command, Dhananjaya of immeasurable prowess set out<br>(from Kamyaka) to obtain a sight of Sakra, the chief of the celestials<br>and of Sankara, the god of gods. And the strong-armed Arjuna of great<br>might set out armed with his celestial bow and a sword with golden hilt,<br>for the success of the object he had in view, northwards, towards the<br>summit of the Himavat. And, O king, that first of all warriors in the<br>three worlds, the son of Indra, with a calm mind, and firmly adhering to<br>his purpose, then devoted himself, without the loss of any time, to<br>ascetic austerities. And he entered, all alone, that terrible forest<br>abounding with thorny plants and trees and flowers and fruits of various<br>kinds, and inhabited by winged creatures of various species, and swarming<br>with animals of diverse kinds, and resorted to by Siddhas and Charanas.<br>And when the son of Kunti entered that forest destitute of human beings,<br>sounds of conchs and drums began to be heard in the heavens. And a thick<br>shower of flowers fell upon the earth, and the clouds spreading over the<br>firmament caused a thick shade. Passing over those difficult and woody<br>regions at the foot of the great mountains, Arjuna soon reached the<br>breast of the Himavat; and staying there for sometime began to shine in<br>his brilliancy. And he beheld there numerous trees with expanding<br>verdure, resounding with the melodious notes of winged warblers. And he<br>saw there rivers with currents of the lapis lazuli, broken by the fierce<br>eddies here and there, and echoing with the notes of swans and ducks and<br>cranes. And the banks of those rivers resounded with the mellifluous<br>strains of the male Kokilas and the notes of peacocks and cranes. And the<br>mighty warrior, beholding those rivers of sacred and pure and delicious<br>water and their charming banks, became highly delighted. And the<br>delighted Arjuna of fierce energy and high soul then devoted himself to<br>rigid austerities in that delightful and woody region. Clad in rags made<br>of grass and furnished with a black deerskin and a stick, he commenced to<br>eat withered leaves fallen upon the ground. And he passed the first<br>month, by eating fruits at the interval of three nights; and the second<br>by eating at the interval of the six nights; and the third by eating at<br>the interval of a fortnight. When the fourth month came, that best of the<br>Bharatas&#8212;the strong-armed son of Pandu&#8212;began to subsist on air alone.<br>With arms upraised and leaning upon nothing and standing on the tips of<br>his toes, he continued his austerities. And the illustrious hero's locks,<br>in consequence of frequent bathing took the hue of lightning or the<br>lotus. Then all the great Rishis went together unto the god of the Pinaka<br>for representing unto him about the fierce asceticism of Pritha's son.<br>And bowing unto that god of gods, they informed him of Arjuna's<br>austerities saying, 'This son of pritha possessed of great energy is<br>engaged in the most difficult of ascetic austerities on the breast of the<br>Himavat. Heated with his asceticism, the earth is smoking all round, O<br>god of gods. We do not know what his object is for which he is engaged in<br>these austerities. He, however, is causing us pain. It behoveth thee to<br>prevent him!' Hearing these words of those munis with souls under perfect<br>control, the lord of all creatures&#8212;the husband of Uma said, 'It behoveth<br>you not to indulge in any grief on account of Phalguna! Return ye all<br>cheerfully and with alacrity to the places whence ye have come. I know<br>the desire that is in Arjuna's heart. His wish is not for heaven, nor for<br>prosperity, nor for long life. And I will accomplish, even, this day, all<br>that is desired by him.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "The truth-speaking Rishis, having heard these<br>words of Mahadeva, became delighted, and returned to their respective<br>abodes."
