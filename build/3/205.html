                            "Markandeya said, 'There was, O Bharata, a virtuous ascetic of the name<br>of Kausika and endued with wealth of asceticism and devoted to the study<br>of the Vedas, he was a very superior Brahmana and that best of Brahmanas<br>studied all the Vedas with the Angas and the Upanishadas and one day he<br>was reciting the Vedas at the foot of a tree and at that time there sat<br>on the top of that tree a female crane and that she-crane happened at<br>that time to befoul the Brahmana's body and beholding that crane the<br>Brahmana became very angry and thought of doing her an injury and as the<br>Brahmana cast his angry glances upon the crane and thought also of doing<br>her an injury, she fell down on the ground and beholding the crane thus<br>fallen from the tree and insensible in death, the Brahmana was much moved<br>by pity and the regenerate one began to lament for the dead crane saying,<br>'Alas, I have done a bad deed, urged by anger and malice!'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Having repeated these words many times, that<br>learned Brahmana entered a village for procuring alms. And, O bull of the<br>Bharata race, in course of his eleemosynary round among the houses of<br>persons of good lineage, the Brahmana entered one such house that he knew<br>from before. And as he entered the house, he said, 'Give'. And he was<br>answered by a female with the word, 'Stay'. And while the housewife was<br>engaged, O king, in cleaning the vessel from which alms are given, her<br>husband, O thou best of the Bharatas, suddenly entered the house, very<br>much afflicted with hunger. The chaste housewife beheld her husband and<br>disregarding the Brahmana, gave her lord water to wash his feet and face<br>and also a seat and after that the black-eyed lady, placing before her<br>lord savoury food and drink, humbly stood beside him desirous of<br>attending to all his wants. And, O Yudhishthira, that obedient wife used<br>every day to eat the orts of her husband's plate and, always conducting<br>herself in obedience to the wishes of the lord, that lady ever regarded<br>her husband, and all her heart's affections inclined towards her lord. Of<br>various and holy behaviour and skilful in all domestic duties and<br>attentive to all her relatives, she always did what was agreeable and<br>beneficial to her husband and she also, with rapt senses attended to the<br>worship of the gods and the wants of guests and servants and her<br>mother-in-law and father-in-law.<br><br>"And while the lady of handsome eyes was still engaged in waiting upon<br>her lord, she beheld that Brahmana waiting for alms and beholding him,<br>she remembered that she had asked him to wait. And remembering all this,<br>she felt abashed. And then that chaste woman possessed of great fame,<br>took something for alms and went out, O thou foremost of the Bharatas,<br>for giving it unto that Brahmana. And when she came before him, the<br>Brahmana said, 'O best of women, O blessed one, I am surprised at thy<br>conduct! Having requested me to wait saying, 'Stay' thou didst not<br>dismiss me!'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'O lord of men beholding that Brahmana filled with<br>wrath and blazing with his energy, that chaste woman began to conciliate<br>him and said, 'O learned one, it behoveth thee to forgive me. My husband<br>is my supreme god. He came hungry and tired and was being served and<br>waited upon by me.' Hearing this, the Brahmana said, 'With thee Brahmanas<br>are not worthy of superior regard. Exaltest thou thy husband above them?<br>Leading a domestic life, dost thou disregard Brahmanas? Indra himself<br>boweth down unto them, what shall I say of men on earth. Proud woman,<br>dost thou not know it, hast thou never heard it, that the Brahmanas are<br>like fire and may consume the entire earth?' At these words of that<br>Brahmana the woman answered, 'I am no she-crane, O regenerate Rishi! O<br>thou that art endued with the wealth of asceticism, cast off this anger<br>of thine. Engaged as thou are, what canst thou do to me with these angry<br>glances of thine? I do not disregard Brahmanas. Endued with great energy<br>of soul, they are like unto the gods themselves. But, O sinless one, this<br>fault of mine it behoveth thee to forgive. I know the energy and high<br>dignity of Brahmanas that are possessed of wisdom. The waters of the<br>ocean have been made brackish and undrinkable by the wrath of the<br>Brahmanas. I know also the energy of Munis of souls under complete<br>control and endued with blazing ascetic merit. The fire of their wrath to<br>this day hath not been extinguished in the forest of Dandaka. It was for<br>his having disregarded the Brahmanas that the great Asura&#8212;the wicked and<br>evil-minded Vatapi was digested when he came in contact with Agastya. It<br>hath been heard by us that the powers and merits of high-souled Brahmanas<br>are great. But, O Brahmana, as regenerate ones of high souls are great in<br>wrath, so are they equally great in forgiveness. Therefore, O sinless<br>one, it behoveth thee to forgive me in the matter of this my offence. O<br>Brahmana, my heart inclineth to that merit which springeth from the<br>service of my husband, for I regard my husband as the highest among all<br>the gods. O best of Brahmanas, I practise that virtue which consists in<br>serving my husband whom I regard as the highest Deity. Behold, O<br>regenerate one, the merit that attaches to the service of one's husband!<br>I know that thou hast burnt a she-crane with thy wrath! But, O best of<br>regenerate ones, the anger that a person cherishes is the greatest of<br>foes which that person hath. The gods know him for a Brahmana who hath<br>cast off anger and passion. The gods know him for a Brahmana who always<br>speaketh the truth here, who always gratifieth his preceptor, and who,<br>though injured himself, never returneth the injury. The gods know him for<br>a Brahmana who hath his senses under control, who is virtuous and pure<br>and devoted to the study of the Vedas, and who hath mastery over anger<br>and lust. The gods know him for a Brahmana who, cognisant of morals and<br>endued with mental energy, is catholic in religion and looketh upon all<br>equal unto himself. The gods know him for a Brahmana who studieth himself<br>and teacheth others, who performeth sacrifices himself and officiateth at<br>the sacrifices of others, and who giveth away to the best of his means.<br>The gods know that bull among the regenerate ones for a Brahmana who,<br>endued with liberality of soul, practiseth the Brahmacharya vow and is<br>devoted to study,&#8212;in fact who is vigilantly devoted to the study of the<br>Vedas. Whatever conduceth to the happiness of the Brahmanas is always<br>recited before these. Ever taking pleasure in truth, the hearts of such<br>men never find joy in untruth. O thou best of regenerate ones, it hath<br>been said that the study of the Vedas, tranquillity of soul, simplicity<br>of behaviour, and repression of the senses, constitute the eternal duties<br>of the Brahmana. Those cognisant with virtue and morals have said that<br>truth and honesty are the highest virtue. Virtue that is eternal is<br>difficult of being understood. But whatever it is, it is based on truth.<br>The ancients have declared that virtue dependeth on sruti. But, O<br>foremost of regenerate ones, virtue as exposed in sruti appears to be of<br>various kinds. It is, therefore, too subtle of comprehension. Thou, O<br>holy one, art cognisant of virtue, pure, and devoted to the study of the<br>Vedas. I think, however, O holy one, that thou dost not know what virtue<br>in reality is. Repairing to the city of Mithila, enquire thou of a<br>virtuous fowler there, if indeed, O regenerate one, thou art not really<br>acquainted with what constitutes the highest virtue. There liveth in<br>Mithila a fowler who is truthful and devoted to the service of his<br>parents and who hath senses under complete control. Even he will<br>discourse to thee on virtue. Blessed be thou, O best of regenerate ones,<br>if thou likest, repair thither. O faultless one, it behoveth thee to<br>forgive me, if what I have said be unpalatable, for they that are<br>desirous of acquiring virtue are incapable of injuring women!'<br><br>"At these words of the chaste woman, the Brahmana replied, saying, 'I am<br>gratified with thee. Blessed be thou; my anger hath subsided, O beautiful<br>one! The reproofs uttered by thee will be of the highest advantage to me.<br>Blessed be thou, I shall now go and accomplish what is so conducive, O<br>handsome one, to my benefit!'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Dismissed by her, Kausika, that best of<br>regenerate ones, left her house, and, reproaching himself, returned to<br>his own abode.'"
