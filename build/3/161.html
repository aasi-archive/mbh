                            "The lord of treasures said, 'O Yudhishthira, patience, ability,<br>(appropriate) time and place and prowess&#8212;these five lead to success in<br>human affairs. O Bharata, in the Krita Yuga, men were patient and able in<br>their respective occupations and they knew how to display prowess. And, O<br>foremost of the Kshatriyas, a Kshatriya that is endued with patience and<br>understandeth the propriety regarding place and time and is versed in all<br>mortal regulations, can alone govern the world for a long time,&#8212;nay, in<br>all transactions. He that behaveth thus, acquireth, O hero, fame in this<br>world and excellent state in the next. And by having displayed his<br>prowess at the proper place and time, Sakra with the Vasus hath obtained<br>the dominion of heaven. He that from anger cannot see his fall and he<br>that being naturally wicked and evilminded followeth evil and he that<br>knoweth not the propriety relative to acts, meet with destruction both in<br>this world and the next. The exertions of that stupid person become<br>fruitless, who is not conversant with the expediency regarding time and<br>acts, and he meeteth with destruction both in this world and the next.<br>And the object of that wicked and deceitful persons is vicious, who,<br>aiming at mastery of every kind, committeth some rash act. O best of men,<br>Bhimasena is fearless, and ignorant of duties, and haughty, and of the<br>sense of a child, and unforbearing. Do thou, therefore, check him.<br>Repairing again to the hermitage of the pious sage Arshtisena, do thou<br>reside there during the dark fortnight, without fear or anxiety. O lord<br>of men, deputed by me, all the Gandharvas residing at Alaka, as also<br>those dwelling in this mountain, will, O mighty-armed one, protect thee,<br>and these best of the Brahmanas. And, O king, O chief among virtuous men,<br>knowing that Vrikodara hath come hither out of rashness, do thou check<br>him. Henceforth, O monarch, beings living in the forest will meet you,<br>wait upon you and always protect you all. And, ye foremost of men, my<br>servants will always procure for you various meats and drinks of<br>delicious flavour. And, O son, Yudhishthira, even as by reason of your<br>being the progeny of spiritual intercourse, Jishnu is entitled to the<br>protection of Mahendra, and Vrikodara, of the Wind-god, and thou, of<br>Dharma, and the twins possessed of strength, of the Aswins,&#8212;so ye all<br>are entitled to my protection. That one next by birth to Bhimasena,<br>Phalguna, versed in the science of profit and all mortal regulations, is<br>well in heaven. And, O child, those perfections that are recognised in<br>the world as leading to heaven, are established in Dhananjaya even from<br>his very birth. And self-restraint, and charity, and strength, and<br>intelligence, and modesty, and fortitude, and excellent energy&#8212;even all<br>these are established in that majestic one of magnificent soul. And, O<br>Pandava, Jishnu never committed any shameful act through poverty of<br>spirit. And in the world, none ever say that Partha hath uttered an<br>untruth. And, O Bharata, honoured by the gods, pitris, and the<br>Gandharvas, that enhancer of the glory of the Kurus is learning the<br>science of weapons in Sakra's abode. And, O Partha, in heaven he that<br>with justice had brought under his subjection all the rulers of the<br>earth, even that exceedingly powerful and highly energetic monarch, the<br>grandsire of thy father, Santanu himself, is well-pleased with the<br>behaviour of that wielder of the Gandiva&#8212;the foremost of his race. And,<br>O king, abiding in Indra's regions, he who on the banks of the Yamuna had<br>worshipped the gods, the pitris, and the Brahmanas, by celebrating seven<br>grand horse sacrifices, that great grandsire of thine, the emperor<br>Santanu of severe austerities, who hath attained heaven, hath enquired of<br>thy welfare.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Having heard these words of the dispenser of wealth,<br>the Pandavas were well-pleased with them. Then lowering his club and mace<br>and sword and bow, that foremost of the Bharatas bowed down unto Kuvera.<br>And that giver of protection, the lord of treasures, seeing him<br>prostrate, said, 'Be thou the destroyer of the pride of foes, and the<br>enhancer of the delight of friends. And ye oppressors of enemies, do ye<br>live in our romantic region. The Yakshas will not cross your desires.<br>Gudakesa, after having acquired mastery over weapons, will come back<br>soon. Bidden adieu by Maghavat himself, Dhananjaya will join you.'<br><br>"Having thus instructed Yudhishthira of excellent deeds, the lord of the<br>Guhyakas, vanished from that best of mountains. And thousands upon<br>thousands of Yakshas, and Rakshasas followed him in vehicles spread over<br>with checkered cushions, and decorated with various jewels. And as the<br>horses proceeded towards the abode of Kuvera, a noise arose as of birds<br>flying in the air. And the chargers of the lord of treasures speedily<br>coursed through the sky as if drawing forward the firmament, and<br>devouring the air.<br><br>"Then at the command of the lord of wealth, the dead bodies of the<br>Rakshasas were removed from the summit of the mountain. As the<br>intelligent Agastya had fixed this period as the limit of (the duration<br>of) his curse, so being slain in conflict, the Rakshasas were freed from<br>the imprecation. And being honoured by the Rakshasas, the Pandavas for<br>several nights dwelt pleasantly in those habitations."
