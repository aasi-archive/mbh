                            Vaisampayana continued, "And the powerful Bhimasena, having thus come<br>under the power of the snake, thought of its mighty and wonderful<br>prowess; and said unto it, 'Be thou pleased to tell me, O snake, who thou<br>art. And, O foremost of reptiles, what wilt thou do with me? I am<br>Bhimasena, the son of Pandu, and next by birth to Yudhishthira the just.<br>And endued as I am with the strength of ten thousand elephants, how hast<br>thou been able to overpower me? In fight have been encountered and slain<br>by me innumerable lions, and tigers, and buffaloes, and elephants. And, O<br>best of serpents, mighty Rakshasas and Pisachas, and Nagas, are unable to<br>stand the force of my arms. Art thou possessed of any magic, or hast thou<br>received any boon, that although exerting myself, I have been overcome by<br>thee? Now I have been convinced that the strength of men is false, for, O<br>serpent, by thee hath such mighty strength of men been baffled.'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "When the heroic Bhima of noble deed had said<br>this, the snake caught him, and coiled him all round with his body,<br>having thus subdued that mighty-aimed one, and freed his plump arms<br>alone, the serpent spake these words, 'By good fortune it is that, myself<br>being hungry, after long time the gods have to-day destined thee for my<br>food; for life is dear unto every embodied being, I should relate unto<br>thee the way in which I have come by this snake form. Hear, O best of the<br>pious, I have fallen into this plight on account of the wrath of the<br>Maharhis. Now desirous of getting rid of the curse, I will narrate unto<br>thee all about it. Thou hast, no doubt, heard of the royal sage, Nahusha.<br>He was the son of Ayu, and the perpetuator of the line of thy ancestors.<br>Even I am that one. For having affronted the Brahmanas I, by (virtue of)<br>Agastya's malediction, have come by this condition. Thou art my agnate,<br>and lovely to behold,&#8212;so thou shouldst not be slain by me,&#8212;yet I shall<br>to-day devour thee! Do thou behold the dispensation of Destiny! And be it<br>a buffalo, or an elephant, none coming within my reach at the sixth<br>division of the day, can, O best of men, escape. And, O best of the<br>Kurus, thou hast not been taken by an animal of the lower order, having<br>strength alone,&#8212;but this (hath been so) by reason only of the boon I<br>have received. As I was falling rapidly from Sakra's throne placed on the<br>front of his palace, I spake unto that worshipful sage (Agastya), 'Do<br>thou free me from this curse.' Thereat filled with compassion, that<br>energetic one said unto me, 'O king, thou shall be freed after the lapse<br>of some time.' Then I fell to the earth (as a snake); but my recollection<br>(of former life) did not renounce me. And although it be so ancient, I<br>still recollect all that was said. And the sage said unto me, That person<br>who conversant with the relation subsisting between the soul and the<br>Supreme Being, shall be able to answer the questions put by thee, shall<br>deliver thee. And, O king, taken by thee, strong beings superior to thee,<br>shall immediately lose their strength, I heard these words of those<br>compassionate ones, who felt attached unto me. And then the Brahmanas<br>vanished. Thus, O highly effulgent one, having become a serpent, I, doing<br>exceedingly sinful acts, live in unclean hell, in expectation of the<br>(appointed) time.' The mighty-armed Bhimasena addressed the serpent,<br>saying, 'I am not angry, O mighty snake,&#8212;nor do I blame myself. Since in<br>regard to happiness and misery, men sometimes possess the power of<br>bringing and dismissing them, and sometimes do not. Therefore one should<br>not fret one's mind. Who can baffle destiny by self-exertion? I deem<br>destiny to be supreme, and self-exertion to be of no avail. Smitten with<br>the stroke of destiny, the prowess of my arms lost, behold me to-day<br>fallen unto this condition without palpable cause. But to-day I do not so<br>much grieve for my own self being slain, as I do for my brothers deprived<br>of their kingdom, and exiled into the forest. This Himalaya is<br>inaccessible, and abounds with Yakshas and the Rakshasas, And searching<br>about for me, they will be distracted. And hearing that I have been<br>killed, (my brothers) will forego all exertion, for, firm in promise,<br>they have hitherto been controlled by my harsh speech, I being desirous<br>of gaining the kingdom. Or the intelligent Arjuna (alone), being versed<br>in every lore, and incapable of being overcome by gods and Rakshasas and<br>Gandharvas, will not be afflicted with grief. That mighty-armed and<br>exceedingly powerful one is able single-handed to speedily pull down from<br>his place even the celestials. What shall I say of the deceitfully<br>gambling son of Dhritarashtra, detested of all men, and filled with<br>haughtiness and ignorance! And I also grieve for my poor mother,<br>affectionate to her sons, who is ever solicitous for our greatness in a<br>large measure than is attained by our enemies. O serpent, the desire that<br>forlorn one had in me will all be fruitless in consequence of my<br>destruction. And gifted with manliness, the twins, Nakula and Sahadeva,<br>following their elder brother (me), and always protected by the strength<br>of my arms, will, owing to my destruction, be depressed and deprived of<br>their prowess, and stricken with grief. This is what I think.' In this<br>way Vrikodara lamented profusely. And being bound by the body of the<br>snake, he could not exert himself.<br><br>"On the other hand, Kunti's son, Yudhishthira, (seeing) and reflecting on<br>dreadful ill omens, became alarmed. Terrified by the blaze of the points<br>of the horizon, jackals stationing themselves on the right of that<br>hermitage, set up frightful and inauspicious yells. And ugly Vartikas as<br>of dreadful sight, having one wing, one eye, and one leg, were seen to<br>vomit blood, facing the sun. And the wind began to blow dryly, and<br>violently, attracting grits. And to the right all the beasts and birds<br>began to cry. And in the rear the black crows cried, 'Go!' 'Go!' And<br>momentarily his (Yudhishthira's) right arm began to twitch, and his chest<br>and left leg shook (of themselves). And indicating evil his left eye<br>contracted spasmodically. Thereupon, O Bharata, the intelligent<br>Yudhishthira the just, inferring some great calamity (to be imminent),<br>asked Draupadi, saying, 'Where is Bhima?' Thereat Panchali said that<br>Vrikodara had long gone out. Hearing this, that mighty-armed king set out<br>with Dhaumya, after having said unto Dhananjaya, "Thou shouldst protect<br>Draupadi.' And he also directed Nakula and Sahadeva to protect the<br>Brahmanas. And issuing from the hermitage that lord, Kunti's son,<br>following the footprints of Bhimasena, began to search for him in that<br>mighty forest. And on coming to the east, he found mighty leaders of<br>elephant-herds (slain) and saw the earth marked with Bhima's<br>(foot-prints). Then seeing thousands of deer and hundreds of lions lying<br>in the forest, the king ascertained his course. And on the way were<br>scattered trees pulled down by the wind caused by the thighs of that hero<br>endued with the speed of the wind as he rushed after the deer. And<br>proceeding, guided by those marks, to a spot filled with dry winds and<br>abounding in leafless vegetables, brackish and devoid of water, covered<br>with thorny plants and scattered over with gravel, stumps and shrubs and<br>difficult of access and uneven and dangerous, he saw in a mountain cavern<br>his younger brother motionless, caught in the folds of that foremost of<br>snakes."
