                            "Lomasa said, 'The blessed God having heard what Bhagiratha had said, and<br>with a view to doing what was agreeable to the residents of heaven,<br>replied to the king, saying, 'So let it be. O most righteous of the<br>protectors of men, O (prince) of a powerful arm! For thy sake I shall<br>sustain the river of the gods, when she will take her descent from the<br>sky, she who is pure and blessed and divine, O (king) of a mighty arm!'<br>Saying this, he came to the snowy mountain, surrounded by his attendants,<br>of awful mien, and with uplifted weapons of diverse forms. And standing<br>there, he said to Bhagiratha, the most praiseworthy of men, 'O (prince)<br>of a powerful arm! do thou pray to the river, the daughter of the king of<br>mountains. I shall sustain that most praiseworthy of rivers when she<br>falls down from the third region of the world (heaven).' Having heard<br>these words uttered by Siva, the king became devout (in heart), made<br>obesiance and directed his thoughts towards Ganga. Then the delightful<br>(river), of pure water in being so thought of by the king, and seeing<br>that the great lord (Siva) was standing (to receive her fall), came down<br>all of a sudden from the sky. And seeing that she had taken her leap from<br>the sky, the gods, together with the mighty saints, the Gandharvas, the<br>snakes, and the Yakshas, assembled there as spectators. Then came down<br>from the sky Ganga, the daughter of the snowy mountain. And her<br>whirlpools were raging, and she was teeming with fishes and sharks. O<br>king! she directing her course towards the sea, separated herself, into<br>three streams; and her water was bestrewn with piles of froth, which<br>looked like so many rows of (white) ganders. And crooked and tortuous in<br>the movement of her body, at places; and at others stumbling at it were;<br>and covered with foam as with a robe: she went forward like a woman<br>drunk. And elsewhere, by virtue of the roar of her waters, she uttered<br>loud sounds. Thus assuming very many different aspects, when she fell<br>from the sky, and reached the surface of the earth, she said to<br>Bhagiratha, 'O great king! show me the path that I shall have to take. O<br>lord of the earth! for thy sake have I descended to the earth.' Having<br>heard these words, king Bhagiratha directed his course towards the spot<br>where lay those bodies of mighty Sagara's sons, in order that, O most<br>praiseworthy of men, the holy water might flood (the same). Having<br>achieved the task of sustaining Ganga, Siva, saluted by men, went to<br>Kailasa the most praiseworthy of mountains, accompanied by the<br>celestials. And the protector of men (Bhagiratha) accompanied by Ganga<br>reached the sea; and the sea, the abode of Varuna, was quickly filled.<br>And the king adopted Ganga as a daughter of himself, and at that spot<br>offered libations of water to the names of his forefathers; thus was his<br>heart's wish fulfilled. Thus asked by thee, I have narrated the whole<br>story how Ganga running in three streams, was brought down to the earth<br>for filling the sea; how the mighty saint had drunk up the sea for a<br>particular reason, and how, O lord! Vatapi, the slayer of Brahmanas, was<br>destroyed by Agastya.'"
