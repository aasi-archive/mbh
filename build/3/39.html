                            Vaisampayana said, "After all those illustrious ascetics had gone away,<br>that wielder of the Pinaka and cleanser of all sins&#8212;the illustrious<br>Hara&#8212;assuming the form of a Kirata resplendent as a golden tree, and<br>with a huge and stalwart form like a second Meru, and taking up a hand<br>some bow and a number of arrows resembling snakes of virulent poison, and<br>looking like an embodiment of fire, came quickly down on the breast of<br>Himavat. And the handsome god of gods was accompanied by Uma in the guise<br>of a Kirata woman, and also by a swarm of merry spirits of various forms<br>and attire, and by thousands of women in the form and attire of Kiratas.<br>And, O king, that region suddenly blazed up in beauty, in consequence of<br>the arrival of the god of gods in such company. And soon enough a solemn<br>stillness pervaded the place. The sounds of springs, and water-courses,<br>and of birds suddenly ceased. And as the god of gods approached Pritha's<br>son of blameless deeds, he beheld a wonderful sight, even that of a<br>Danava named Muka, seeking, in the form of a boar, to slay Arjuna.<br>Phalguna, at the sight of the enemy seeking to slay him, took up the<br>Gandiva and a number of arrows resembling snakes of virulent poison. And<br>stringing his bow and filling the air with its twang, he addressed the<br>boar and said, 'I have come here but done thee no injury. As thou seekest<br>to slay me, I shall certainly send thee to the abode of Yama.' And<br>beholding that firm wielder of the bow&#8212;Phalguna&#8212;about to slay the boar,<br>Sankara in the guise of a Kirata suddenly bade him stop saying, 'The boar<br>like the mountain of Indrakila in hue hath been aimed at by me first';<br>Phalguna, however, disregarding these words, struck the boar. The Kirata<br>also blazing splendour, let fly an arrow like flaming fire and resembling<br>the thunderbolt at the same object. And the arrows thus shot by both fell<br>at the same instant of time upon the wide body of Muka, hard as adamant.<br>And the two shafts fell upon the boar with a loud sound, even like that<br>of Indra's thunderbolt and the thunder of the clouds falling together<br>upon the breast of a mountain. And Muka, thus struck by two shafts which<br>produced numerous arrows resembling snakes of blazing mouths, yielded up<br>his life, assuming once more his terrible Rakshasa form. Jishnu&#8212;that<br>slayer of foes&#8212;then beheld before him that person, of form blazing as<br>god, and attired in the dress of a Kirata and accompanied by many women.<br>And beholding him, the son of Kunti with a joyous heart addressed him<br>smilingly and said, 'Who art thou that thus wanderest in these solitary<br>woods, surrounded by women? thou of the splendour of gold, art thou not<br>afraid of this terrible forest? Why, again, didst thou shoot the boar<br>that was first aimed at by me? This Rakshasa that came hither, listlessly<br>or with the object, of slaying me, had been first aimed at by me. Thou<br>shalt not, therefore, escape from me with life. Thy behaviour towards me<br>is not consistent with the customs of the chase. Therefore, O<br>mountaineer, I will take thy life.' Thus addressed by the son of Pandu,<br>the Kirata, smiling replied unto his capable of wielding the bow with his<br>left hand, in soft words, saying, 'O hero, thou needst not be anxious on<br>my account. This forest land is proper abode for us who always dwell in<br>the woods. Respecting thyself, however, I may inquire, why thou hast<br>selected thy abode here amid such difficulties. We, O ascetic, have our<br>habitation in these woods abounding in animals of all kinds. Why dost<br>thou, so delicate and brought up in luxury and possessed of the splendour<br>of fire, dwell alone in such a solitary region?' Arjuna said, 'Depending<br>on the Gandiva and arrows blazing like fire, I live in this great forest,<br>like a second Pavaki. Thou hast seen how this monster&#8212;this terrible<br>Rakshasa&#8212;that came hither in the form of an animal, hath been slain by<br>me.' The Kirata replied, 'This Rakshasa, first struck with the shot from<br>my bow, was killed and sent to the regions of Yama by me. He was first<br>aimed at by me. And it is with my shot that he has been deprived of life.<br>Proud of thy strength, it behoveth thee not to impute thy own fault to<br>others. Thou art thyself in fault, O wretch, and, therefore, shalt not<br>escape from me with life. Stay thou: I will shoot at thee shafts like<br>thunderbolts. Strive thou also and shoot, to the best of thy power, thy<br>arrows at me.' Hearing these words of the Kirata, Arjuna became angry,<br>and attacked him with arrows. The Kirata, however, with a glad heart<br>received all those shafts upon himself, repeatedly saying, 'Wretch,<br>wretch, shoot thou best arrows capable of piercing into the very vitals.'<br>Thus addressed, Arjuna, began to shower his arrows on him. Both of them<br>then became angry and, engaging in fierce conflict, began to shoot at<br>each other showers of arrows, each resembling a snake of virulent poison.<br>And Arjuna rained a perfect shower of arrows on the Kirata, Sankara,<br>however, bore that downpour on him with a cheerful heart. But the wielder<br>of the Pinaka, having borne that shower of arrows for a moment, stood<br>unwounded, immovable like a hill. Dhananjaya, beholding his arrowy shower<br>become futile, wondered exceedingly, repeatedly saying, 'Excellent!<br>Excellent! Alas, this mountaineer of delicate limbs, dwelling on the<br>heights of the Himavat, beareth, without wavering, the shafts shot from<br>the Gandiva! Who is he? Is he Rudra himself, or some other god, or a<br>Yaksha, or an Asura? The gods sometimes do descend on the heights of the<br>Himavat. Except the god who wieldeth the Pinaka, there is none rise that<br>can bear the impetuosity of the thousands of arrows shot by me from the<br>Gandiva. Whether he is a god or a Yaksha, in fact, anybody except Rudra,<br>I shall soon send him, with my shafts, to the regions of Yama.' Thus<br>thinking, Arjuna, with a cheerful heart, began, O king, to shoot arrows<br>by hundreds, resembling in splendour the rays of the sun. That downpour<br>of shafts, however, the illustrious Creator of the worlds&#8212;the wielder of<br>the trident&#8212;bore with a glad heart, like a mountain bearing a shower of<br>rocks. Soon, however, the arrows of Phalguna were exhausted. And noticing<br>this fact, Arjuna became greatly alarmed. And the son of Pandu then began<br>to think of the illustrious god Agni who had before, during the burning<br>of the Khandava, given him a couple of inexhaustible quivers. And he<br>began to think, 'Alas, my arrows are all exhausted. What shall I shoot<br>now from my bow? Who is this person that swalloweth my arrows? Slaying<br>him with the end of my bow, as elephants are killed with lances, I shall<br>send him to the domains of the mace-bearing Yama.' The illustrious Arjuna<br>then, taking up his bow and dragging the Kirata with his bow-string,<br>struck him some fierce blows that descended like thunderbolts. When,<br>however, that slayer of hostile heroes&#8212;the son of Kunti&#8212;commenced the<br>conflict with the end of the bow, the mountaineer snatched from his hands<br>that celestial bow. And beholding his bow snatched from him, Arjuna took<br>up his sword, and wishing to end the conflict, rushed at his foe. And<br>then the Kuru prince, with the whole might of his arms, struck that sharp<br>weapon upon the head of the Kirata, a weapon that was incapable of being<br>resisted even by solid rocks. But that first of swords, at touch of the<br>Kirata's crown, broke into pieces. Phalguna then commenced the conflict<br>with trees and stones. The illustrious god in the form of the huge-bodied<br>Kirata, however, bore that shower of trees and rocks with patience. The<br>mighty son of Pritha then, his mouth smoking with wrath, struck the<br>invincible god in the form of a Kirata, with hi clenched fists, blows<br>that descended like thunderbolts. The god in the Kirata form returned<br>Phalguna's blows with fierce blows resembling the thunderbolts of Indra.<br>And in consequence of that conflict of blows between the son of Pandu and<br>the Kirata, there arose in that place loud and frightful sounds. That<br>terrible conflict of blows, resembling the conflict of yore between<br>Vritra and Vasava, lasted but for a moment. The mighty Jishnu clasping<br>the Kirata began to press him with his breast, but the Kirata, possessed<br>of great strength pressed the insensible son of Pandu with force. And in<br>consequence of the pressure of their arms and of their breasts, their<br>bodies began to emit smoke like charcoal in fire. The great god then,<br>smiting the already smitten son of Pandu, and attacking him in anger with<br>his full might, deprived him of his senses. Then, O Bharata, Phalguna,<br>thus pressed by the god of the gods, with limbs, besides, bruised and<br>mangled, became incapable of motion and was almost reduced to a ball of<br>flesh. And struck by the illustrious god, he became breathless and,<br>falling down on earth without power of moving, looked like one that was<br>dead. Soon, however, he regained consciousness, and, rising from his<br>prostrate position, with body covered with blood, became filled with<br>grief. Mentally prostrating himself before the gracious god of gods, and<br>making a clay image of that deity, he worshipped it, with offerings of<br>floral garlands. Beholding, however, the garland that he had offered to<br>the clay image of Bhava, decking the crown of the Kirata, that best of<br>Pandu's sons became filled with joy and regained his ease. And he<br>prostrated himself thereupon at the feet of Bhava, and the god also was<br>pleased with him. And Hara, beholding the wonder of Arjuna and seeing<br>that his body had been emaciated with ascetic austerities, spake unto him<br>in a voice deep as the roaring of the clouds, saying, 'O Phalguna, I have<br>been pleased with thee for thy act is without a parallel. There is no<br>Kshatriya who is equal to thee in courage, and patience. And, O sinless<br>one, thy strength and prowess are almost equal to mine. O mighty-armed<br>one, I have been pleased with thee. Behold me, O bull of the Bharata<br>race! O large-eyed one! I will grant thee eyes (to see me in my true<br>form). Thou wert a Rishi before. Thou wilt vanquish all thy foes, even<br>the dwellers of heaven; I will as I have been pleased with thee, grant<br>thee an irresistible weapon. Soon shall thou be able to wield that weapon<br>of mine."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Phalguna then beheld him&#8212;Mahadeva&#8212;that god of<br>blazing splendour-that wielder of the Pinaka-that one who had his abode<br>on the mountains (of Kailasa)&#8212;accompanied by Uma. Bending down on his<br>knee and bowing with his head, that conqueror of hostile cities-the son<br>of Pritha-worshipped Hara and inclined him to grace. And Arjuna said, 'O<br>Kapardin, O chief of all gods, O destroyer of the eyes of Bhaga, O god of<br>gods, O Mahadeva, O thou of blue throat, O thou of matted locks, I know<br>thee as the Cause of all causes. O thou of three eyes, O lord of all!<br>Thou art the refuge of all the gods! This universe hath sprung from thee.<br>Thou art incapable of being vanquished by the three worlds of the<br>celestials, the Asuras, and men. Thou art Siva in the form of Vishnu, and<br>Vishnu in the form of Siva. Thou destroyedest of old the great sacrifice<br>of Daksha. O Hari, O Rudra, I bow to thee. Thou hast an eye on thy<br>forehead. O Sarva, O thou that rainest objects of desire, O bearer of the<br>trident, O wielder of the Pinaka, O Surya, O thou of pure body, O Creator<br>of all, I bow to thee. O lord of all created things, I worship thee to<br>obtain thy grace. Thou art the lord of the Ganas, the source of universal<br>blessing, the Cause of the causes of the universe. Thou art beyond the<br>foremost of male beings, thou art the highest, thou art the subtlest, O<br>Hara! O illustrious Sankara, it behoveth thee to pardon my fault. It was<br>even to obtain a sight of thyself that I came to this great mountain,<br>which is dear to thee and which is the excellent abode of ascetics. Thou<br>art worshipped of all worlds. O lord, I worship thee to obtain thy grace.<br>Let not this rashness of mine be regarded as a fault&#8212;this combat in<br>which I was engaged with thee from ignorance. O Sankara, I seek thy<br>protection. Pardon me all I have done."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Endued with great might, the god whose sign was<br>the bull, taking into his the handsome hands of Arjuna, smilingly replied<br>unto him, saying, 'I have pardoned thee. And the illustrious Hara,<br>cheerfully clasping Arjuna with his arms, once more consoling Arjuna said<br>as follows."
