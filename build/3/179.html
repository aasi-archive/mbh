                            Vaisampayana continued, "Yudhishthira, finding his beloved brother coiled<br>by the body of the serpent, said these words: 'O son of Kunti, how hast<br>thou come by this misfortune! And who is this best of serpents having a<br>body like unto a mountain mass?' Bhimasena said, 'O worshipful one, this<br>mighty being hath caught me for food. He is the royal sage Nahusha living<br>in the form of a serpent.' Yudhishthira said, 'O longlived one, do thou<br>free my brother of immeasurable prowess; we will give thee some other<br>food which will appease thy hunger.' The serpent said, 'I have got for<br>diet even this son of a king, come to my mouth of himself. Do thou go<br>away. Thou shouldst not stay here. (If thou remainest here) thou too<br>shall be my fare to-morrow. O mighty-armed one, this is ordained in<br>respect of me, that he that cometh unto my place, becometh my food and<br>thou too art in my quarter. After a long time have I got thy younger<br>brother as my food; I will not let him off; neither do I like to have any<br>other food.' Thereat Yudhishthira said, 'O serpent, whether thou art a<br>god, or a demon, or an Uraga, do thou tell me truly, it is Yudhishthira<br>that asketh thee, wherefore, O snake, hast thou taken Bhimasena? By<br>obtaining which, or by knowing what wilt thou receive satisfaction, O<br>snake, and what food shall I give thee? And how mayst thou free him.' The<br>serpent said, 'O sinless one, I was thy ancestor, the son of Ayu and<br>fifth in descent from the Moon. And I was a king celebrated under the<br>name of Nahusha. And by sacrifices and asceticism and study of the Vedas<br>and self-restraint and prowess I had acquired a permanent dominion over<br>the three worlds. And when I had obtained such dominion, haughtiness<br>possessed me. And thousands of Brahmanas were engaged in carrying my<br>chair. And intoxicated by supremacy, I insulted those Brahmanas. And, O<br>lord of the earth, by Agastya have I been reduced to this pass! Yet, O<br>Pandava, to this day the memory (of my former birth) hath not forsaken<br>me! And, O king, even by the favour of that high-souled Agastya, during<br>the sixth division of the day have I got for meal thy younger brother.<br>Neither will I set him free, nor do I wish for any other food. But if<br>to-day thou answerest the questions put by me, then, I shall deliver<br>Vrikodara!" At this Yudhishthira said, 'O serpent, ask whatever thou<br>listest! I shall, if I can, answer thy questions with the view of<br>gratifying thee, O snake! Thou knowest fully what should be known by<br>Brahmanas. Therefore, O king of snakes, hearing (thee) I shall answer thy<br>queries!'<br><br>The serpent said, 'O Yudhishthira, say&#8212;Who is a Brahmana and what should<br>be known? By thy speech I infer thee to be highly intelligent.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O foremost of serpents, he, it is asserted by the<br>wise, in whom are seen truth, charity, forgiveness, good conduct,<br>benevolence, observance of the rites of his order and mercy is a<br>Brahmana. And, O serpent, that which should be known is even the supreme<br>Brahma, in which is neither happiness nor misery&#8212;and attaining which<br>beings are not affected with misery; what is thy opinion?'<br><br>"The serpent said, 'O Yudhishthira, truth, charity, forgiveness,<br>benevolence, benignity, kindness and the Veda[42] which worketh the<br>benefit of the four orders, which is the authority in matters of religion<br>and which is true, are seen even in the Sudra. As regards the object to<br>be known and which thou allegest is without both happiness and misery, I<br>do not see any such that is devoid of these.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, Those characteristics that are present in a Sudra, do<br>not exist in a Brahmana; nor do those that are in a Brahmana exist in a<br>Sudra. And a Sudra is not a Sudra by birth alone&#8212;nor a Brahmana is<br>Brahmana by birth alone. He, it is said by the wise, in whom are seen<br>those virtues is a Brahmana. And people term him a Sudra in whom those<br>qualities do not exist, even though he be a Brahmana by birth. And again,<br>as for thy assertion that the object to be known (as asserted by me) doth<br>not exist, because nothing exists that is devoid of both (happiness and<br>misery), such indeed is the opinion, O serpent, that nothing exists that<br>is without (them) both. But as in cold, heat doth not exist, nor in heat,<br>cold, so there cannot exist an object in which both (happiness and<br>misery) cannot exist?"<br><br>"The serpent said, 'O king, if thou recognise him as a Brahmana by<br>characteristics, then, O long-lived one, the distinction of caste<br>becometh futile as long as conduct doth not come into play.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'In human society, O mighty and highly intelligent<br>serpent, it is difficult to ascertain one's caste, because of promiscuous<br>intercourse among the four orders. This is my opinion. Men belonging to<br>all orders (promiscuously) beget offspring upon women of all the orders.<br>And of men, speech, sexual intercourse, birth and death are common. And<br>to this the Rishis have borne testimony by using as the beginning of a<br>sacrifice such expressions as&#8212;of what caste so ever we may be, we<br>celebrate the sacrifice. Therefore, those that are wise have asserted<br>that character is the chief essential requisite. The natal ceremony of a<br>person is performed before division of the umbilical cord. His mother<br>then acts as its Savitri and his father officiates as priest. He is<br>considered as a Sudra as long as he is not initiated in the Vedas. Doubts<br>having arisen on this point, O prince; of serpents, Swayambhuba Manu has<br>declared, that the mixed castes are to be regarded as better than the<br>(other) classes, if having gone through the ceremonies of purification,<br>the latter do not conform to the rules of good conduct, O excellent<br>snake! Whosoever now conforms to the rules of pure and virtuous conduct,<br>him have I, ere now, designated as a Brahmana.' The serpent replied, 'O<br>Yudhishthira, thou art acquainted with all that is fit to be known and<br>having listened to thy words, how can I (now) eat up thy brother<br>Vrikodara!"
