                            "Lomasa said, 'Here, O king! The lord of born beings himself performed a<br>sacrifice in former times,&#8212;the ceremony called Ishtikrita, which<br>occupied one thousand years. And Amvarisha, son of Nabhaga, sacrificed<br>near the Yamuna river. And having sacrificed there, he gave away ten<br>Padmas (of gold coins) to the attendant priests, and he obtained the<br>highest success by his sacrifices and austerities. And, O Kunti's son!<br>This is the spot where that sovereign of the entire earth, Nahusha's son,<br>Yayati, of unmeasured force, and who led a holy life, performed his<br>sacrificial rites. He competed with Indra and performed his sacrifice<br>here. Behold how the ground is studded with places for the sacrificial<br>fires of various forms, and how the earth seems to be subsiding here<br>under the pressure of Yayati's pious works. This is the Sami tree, which<br>hath got but a single leaf, and this is a most excellent lake. Behold<br>these lakes of Parasurama, and the hermitage of Narayana. O protector of<br>earth! This is the path which was followed by Richika's son, of<br>unmeasured energy, who roamed over the earth, practising the Yoga rites<br>in the river Raupya. And, O delight of the tribe of Kurus! Hear what a<br>Pisacha woman (she-goblin), who was decked with pestles for her<br>ornaments, said (to a Brahmana woman), as I was reciting here the table<br>of genealogy. (She said), "Having eaten curd in Yugandhara, and lived in<br>Achutasthala, and also bathed in Bhutilaya, thou shouldst live with thy<br>sons. Having passed a single night here, if thou wilt spend the second,<br>the events of the night will be different from those that have happened<br>to thee in the day-time, O most righteous of Bharata's race! Today we<br>shall spend the night at this very spot. O scion of Bharata's race! this<br>is the threshold of the field of the Kurus. O king! At this very spot,<br>the monarch Yayati, son of Nahusha, performed sacrificial rites, and made<br>gifts of an abundance of gems. And Indra was pleased with those sacred<br>rites. This is an excellent holy bathing-place on the river Yamuna, known<br>as Plakshavatarana (descent of the banian tree). Men of cultured minds<br>call it the entrance to the region of heaven. O respected sir! here,<br>after having performed sacrificial rites of the Saraswata king, and<br>making use of the sacrificial stake for their pestle, the highest order<br>of saints performed the holy plunge prescribed at the end of a sacred<br>ceremony. O monarch! King Bharata here performed sacrificial rites. To<br>celebrate the horse-sacrifice, he here set free the horse who was the<br>intended victim. That monarch had won the sovereignty of the earth by<br>righteousness. The horse? he let go more than once were of a colour<br>checkered with black. O tiger among men! it was here that Marutta<br>sheltered by Samvartta, leader of saints, succeeded in performing<br>excellent sacrifices. O sovereign of kings! Having taken his bath at this<br>spot, one can behold all the worlds, and is purified from his evil deeds.<br>Do thou, therefore, bathe at this spot.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Then that most praiseworthy of Pandu's sons, there<br>bathed with his brothers, while the mighty saints were uttering laudatory<br>words to him. And he addressed the following words to Lomasa, 'O thou<br>whose strength lieth in truthfulness! By virtue of this pious act, I<br>behold all the worlds. And from this place, I behold that most<br>praiseworthy of Pandu's sons Arjuna, the rider of white steed."<br><br>'Lomasa said, 'It is even so, O thou of powerful arms! The saints of the<br>highest order thus behold all the regions. Behold this holy Saraswati<br>here, thronged by persons who look upon her as their sole refuge. O most<br>praise worthy of men! having bathed here, thou wilt be free from all thy<br>sins. O Kunti's son! here the celestial saints performed sacrificial<br>rites of Saraswata king: and so did the saints and the royal saints. This<br>is the altar of the lord of beings, five yojanas in extent on all sides<br>round. And this is the field of the magnanimous Kurus, whose habit it was<br>to perform sacrifices.'"
