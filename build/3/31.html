                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thy speech, O Yajnaseni, is delightful, smooth and<br>full of excellent phrases. We have listened to it (carefully). Thou<br>speakest, however, the language of atheism. O princess, I never act,<br>solicitous of the fruits of my actions. I give away, because it is my<br>duty to give; I sacrifice because it is my duty to sacrifice! O Krishna,<br>I accomplish to the best of my power whatever a person living in<br>domesticity should do, regardless of the fact whether those acts have<br>fruits or not. O thou of fair hips, I act virtuously, not from the desire<br>of reaping the fruits of virtue, but of not transgressing the ordinances<br>of the Veda, and beholding also the conduct of the good and wise! My<br>heart, O Krishna, is naturally attracted towards virtue. The man who<br>wisheth to reap the fruits of virtue is a trader in virtue. His nature is<br>mean and he should never be counted amongst the virtuous. Nor doth he<br>ever obtain the fruits of his virtues! Nor doth he of sinful heart, who<br>having accomplished a virtuous act doubteth in his mind, obtain the<br>fruits of his act, in consequence of that scepticism of his! I speak unto<br>thee, under the authority of the Vedas, which constitute the highest<br>proof in such matters, that never shouldst thou doubt virtue! The man<br>that doubteth virtue is destined to take his birth in the brute species.<br>The man of weak understanding who doubteth religion, virtue or the words<br>of the Rishis, is precluded from regions of immortality and bliss, like<br>Sudras from the Vedas! O intelligent one, if a child born of a good race<br>studieth the Vedas and beareth himself virtuously, royal sages of<br>virtuous behaviour regard him as an aged sage (not withstanding his<br>years)! The sinful wretch, however, who doubteth religion and<br>transgresseth the scriptures, is regarded as lower even than Sudras and<br>robbers! Thou hast seen with thy own eyes the great ascetic Markandeya of<br>immeasurable soul come to us! It is by virtue alone that he hath acquired<br>immortality in the flesh. Vyasa, and Vasistha and Maitreya, and Narada<br>and Lomasa, and Suka, and other Rishis have all, by virtue alone, become<br>of pure soul! Thou beholdest them with thy own eyes as furnished with<br>prowess of celestial asceticism, competent to curse or bless (with<br>effect), and superior to the very gods! O sinless one, these all, equal<br>to the celestials themselves, behold with their eyes what Is written in<br>the Vedas, and describe virtue as the foremost duty! It behoveth thee<br>not, therefore, O amiable Queen, to either doubt or censure God or act,<br>with a foolish heart. The fool that doubteth religion and disregardeth<br>virtue, proud of the proof derived from his own reasoning, regardeth not<br>other proofs and holdeth the Rishis, who are capable of knowing the<br>future as present as mad men. The fool regardeth only the external world<br>capable of gratifying his senses, and is blind to everything else. He<br>that doubteth religion hath no expiation for his offence. That miserable<br>wretch is full of anxiety and acquireth not regions of bliss hereafter. A<br>rejector of proofs, a slanderer of the interpretation of the Vedic<br>scriptures, a transgressor urged by lust and covetousness, that fool<br>goeth to hell. O amiable one, he on the other hand, who ever cherisheth<br>religion with faith, obtaineth eternal bliss in the other world. The fool<br>who cherisheth not religion, transgressing the proofs offered by the<br>Rishis, never obtaineth prosperity in any life, for such transgression of<br>the scriptures. It is certain, O handsome one, that with respect to him<br>who regardeth not the words of the Rishis or the conduct of the virtuous<br>as proof, neither this nor the other world existeth. Doubt not, O<br>Krishna, the ancient religion that is practised by the good and framed by<br>Rishis of universal knowledge and capable of seeing all things! O<br>daughter of Drupada, religion is the only raft for those desirous of<br>going to heaven, like a ship to merchants desirous of crossing the ocean.<br>O thou faultless one, if the virtues that are practised by the virtuous<br>had no fruits, this universe then would be enveloped in infamous<br>darkness. No one then would pursue salvation, no one would seek to<br>acquire knowledge not even wealth, but men would live like beasts. If<br>asceticism, the austerities of celibate life, sacrifices, study of the<br>Vedas, charity, honesty,&#8212;these all were fruitless, men would not have<br>practised virtue generation after generation. If acts were all fruitless,<br>a dire confusion would ensue. For what then do Rishis and gods and<br>Gandharvas and Rakshasas who are all independent of human conditions,<br>cherish virtue with such affection? Knowing it for certain that God is<br>the giver of fruits in respect of virtue, they practise virtue in this<br>world. This, O Krishna, is the eternal (source of) prosperity. When the<br>fruits of both knowledge and asceticism are seen, virtue and vice cannot<br>be fruitless. Call to thy mind, O Krishna, the circumstances of thy own<br>birth as thou that heard of them, and recall also the manner in which<br>Dhrishtadyumna of great prowess was born! These, O thou of sweet smiles,<br>are the best proofs (of the fruits of virtue)! They that have their minds<br>under control, reap the fruits of their acts and are content with little.<br>Ignorant fools are not content with even that much they get (here),<br>because they have no happiness born of virtue to acquire to in the world<br>hereafter. The fruitlessness of virtuous acts ordained in the Vedas, as<br>also of all transgressions, the origin and destruction of acts are, O<br>beautiful one, mysterious even to the gods. These are not known to any<br>body and everybody. Ordinary men are ignorant in respect of these. The<br>gods keep up the mystery, for the illusion covering the conduct of the<br>gods is unintelligible. Those regenerate ones that have destroyed all<br>aspirations, that have built all their hopes on vows and asceticism, that<br>have burnt all their sins and have acquired minds where quest and peace<br>and holiness dwell, understand all these. Therefore, though you mayst not<br>see the fruits of virtue, thou shouldst not yet doubt religion or gods.<br>Thou must perform sacrifices with a will, and practise charity without<br>insolence. Acts in this world have their fruits, and virtue also is<br>eternal. Brahma himself told this unto his (spiritual) sons, as testified<br>to by Kashyapa. Let thy doubt, therefore, O Krishna, be dispelled like<br>mist. Reflecting upon all this, let thy scepticism give way to faith.<br>Slander not God, who is the lord of all creatures. Learn how to know him.<br>Bow down unto him. Let not thy mind be such. And, O Krishna, never<br>disregard that Supreme Being through whose grace mortal man, by piety,<br>acquireth immortality!'"
