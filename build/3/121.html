                            Lomasa said, "O king! when the Nriga performed a sacrifice here, he<br>gratified Indra, the demolisher of hostile cities, by offering the Soma<br>juice. And Indra was refreshed and was very much pleased. Here the gods<br>together with Indira, and the protectors of all born beings, celebrated<br>sacrifices of various kinds on a large scale, and paid abundant<br>gratuities to the ministering priests. Here king Amurtarayasa, the lord<br>of the world, satisfied Indra, the holder of the thunderbolt, by the<br>offer of the Soma juice, when seven horse-sacrifices were performed by<br>that king. The articles which in other sacrificial rites are uniformly<br>made of the timber, wood and of earth, were all made of gold in the seven<br>sacrifices performed by him. And it is said that in all those rites,<br>seven sets of stakes, rings for the sacrificial stakes, spots, ladles,<br>utensils, spoons were prepared by him. On each sacrificial stake, seven<br>rings were fastened at the top. And, O Yudhishthira! the celestials<br>together with Indira, themselves erected the sacrificial stakes of<br>shining gold which had been prepared for his sacred rites. In all those<br>magnificent sacrifices instituted by Gaya, the protector of the earth,<br>Indira, was delighted by drinking the Soma juice, and the ministering<br>priests were gratified with the gratuities paid to them. And the priests<br>obtained untold wealth counted out to them. And as the sand-grains of the<br>earth, or as the stars in the sky, or as the rain-drops when it raineth,<br>cannot be counted by anyone, so the wealth Gaya gave away was incapable<br>of being counted by figures. So untold was the wealth, O great king! that<br>was given to the ministering priests in all those seven sacrifices that<br>even the above-mentioned objects might be counted by figures, but the<br>gratuities bestowed by him whose largeness exceeded all that was known<br>before were not capable of being counted by figures. And images of the<br>goddess of speech were made of gold by the sculptor of the gods;&#8212;and the<br>king gratified the members of the sacerdotal caste, who had arrived from<br>all the cardinal points, by making presents to them of those images, of<br>gold. O protector of men! when the high-souled Gaya performed his<br>sacrificial rites, he erected sacrificial piles at so many different<br>spots that but little space was left on the surface of the earth. And, O<br>scion of Bharata's race! he by that sacred act attained the regions of<br>Indra. Whoever should bathe in the river, Payosini, would go to the<br>regions attained by Gaya. Therefore, O lord of kings! O unswerving<br>prince! thou and thy brothers should bathe in this river; then, O<br>protector of the earth, thou wilt be freed from all these sins."<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "O most praiseworthy of men! Yudhishthira with his<br>brothers performed ablutions in the Payosini river. Then, O sinless<br>prince! the powerful monarch together with his brothers, journeyed to the<br>hill of sapphires and the great river Narmada. The blessed saint Lomasa<br>there named to him all the delightful holy spots and all the sacred<br>shrines of the celestials. Then he with his brothers visited those<br>places, according to his desire and convenience. And at various places<br>Brahmanas by thousands received gifts from him."<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'O son of Kunti! one who visits the sapphire Hill and<br>plunges his body in the river Narmada attains the regions inhabited by<br>the celestials and kings. O most praiseworthy of men! this period is the<br>junction between the Treta and the Kali age, O Kunti's son! This is the<br>period when a person gets rid of all his sins. O respected sir! this is<br>the spot where Saryati performed sacrificial rites, wherein Indra<br>appeared in a visible form and drank the Soma juice, with the two<br>celestial physicians. And Bhrigu's son of severe austerities conceived<br>anger towards the great Indra; and the mighty Chyavana paralysed Indra,<br>and for his wife obtained the princess, Sukanya.'"<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'How was the chastiser of the demon Paka, the god<br>possessed of the six attributes, paralysed by Chyavana? And for what<br>reason did the mighty saint conceive wrath towards Indra? And how, O<br>Brahmana! did he raise the celestial physicians to the rank of the<br>drinkers of Soma? All this, precisely as it happened, thy venerable self<br>will be pleased to recount to me.'"
