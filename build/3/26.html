                            Vaisampayana said, "While the illustrious son of Pandu continued to dwell<br>in the Dwaita woods, that great forest became filled with Brahmanas. And<br>the lake within that forest, ever resounding with Vedic recitations,<br>became sacred like a second region of Brahma. And the sounds of the<br>Yajus, the Riks, the Samas, and other words uttered by the Brahmanas,<br>were exceedingly delightful to hear. And the Vedic recitations of the<br>Brahmanas mingling with the twang of bows of the sons of Pritha, produced<br>a union of the Brahmana and Kshatriya customs that was highly beautiful.<br>And one evening the Rishi Vaka of the Dalvya family addressed<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti seated in the midst of the Rishis, saying,<br>'Behold, O chief of the Kurus, O son of Pritha, the homa time is come of<br>these Brahmanas devoted to ascetic austerities, the time when the<br>(sacred) fires have all been lit up! These all, of rigid vows, protected<br>by thee, are performing the rites of religion in this sacred region! The<br>descendants of Bhrigu and Angiras, along with those of Vasishta and<br>Kasyapa, the illustrious sons of Agastya, the offspring of Atri all of<br>excellent vows, in fact, all the foremost Brahmanas of the whole, are now<br>united with thee! Listen, O son of the Kuru race born of Kunti, thyself<br>with thy brothers, to the words I speak to thee! As are aided by the wind<br>consumeth the forest, so Brahma energy mingling with Kshatriya energy,<br>and Kshatriya might mingling with Brahma power, might, when they gathered<br>force, consume all enemies! O child, he should never desire to be without<br>Brahmanas who wisheth to subdue this and the other world for length of<br>days! Indeed, a king slayeth his enemies having obtained a Brahmana<br>conversant, with religion and worldly affairs and freed from passion and<br>folly. King Vali cherishing his subjects practised those duties that lead<br>to salvation, and knew not of any other means in this world than<br>Brahmanas. It was for this that all the desires of Virochana's son, the<br>Asura (Vali), were ever gratified, and his wealth was ever inexhaustible.<br>Having obtained the whole earth through the aid of the Brahmanas, he met<br>with destruction when he began to practise wrong on them! This earth with<br>her wealth never adoreth long as her lord a Kshatriya living without a<br>Brahmana! The earth, however, girt by the sea, boweth unto him who is<br>ruled by a Brahmana and taught his duties by him! Like an elephant in<br>battle without his driver, a Kshatriya destitute of Brahmanas decreaseth<br>in strength! The Brahmana's sight is without compare, and the Kshatriya's<br>might also is unparalleled. When these combine, the whole earth itself<br>cheerfully yieldeth to such a combination. As fire becoming mightier with<br>the wind consumeth straw and wood, so kings with Brahmanas consume all<br>foes! An intelligent Kshatriya, in order to gain what he hath not, and<br>increase what he hath, should take counsel of Brahmanas! Therefore, O son<br>of Kunti, for obtaining what thou hast not and increasing what thou hast,<br>and spending what thou hast on proper objects and persons, keep thou with<br>thee a Brahmana of reputation, of a knowledge of the Vedas, of wisdom and<br>experience! O Yudhishthira. Thou hast ever highly regarded the Brahmanas.<br>It is for this that thy fame is great and blazeth in the three worlds!"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Then all those Brahmanas who were with<br>Yudhishthira worshipped Vaka of the Dalvya race, and having heard him<br>praise Yudhishthira became highly pleased. And Dwaipayana and Narada and<br>Jamadagnya and Prithusravas; and Indradyumna and Bhalaki and Kritachetas<br>and Sahasrapat; and Karnasravas and Munja and Lavanaswa and Kasyapa; and<br>Harita and Sthulakarana and Agnivesya and Saunaka; and Kritavak and<br>Suvakana Vrihadaswa and Vibhavasu; and Urdharetas and Vrishamitra and<br>Suhotra and Hotravahana; these and many other Brahmanas of rigid vows<br>then adored Yudhishthira like Rishis adoring Purandara in heaven!"
