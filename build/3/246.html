                            "Duryodhana said, 'O Radheya, thou knowest not what hath happened.<br>Therefore, I do not resent thy words. Thou thinkest the hostile<br>Gandharvas to have been vanquished by me with my own energy. O thou of<br>mighty arms, my brothers, indeed had for a long time, aided by me fought<br>with the Gandharvas. The slaughtered, indeed, on both sides were great.<br>But when those brave Gandharvas, resorting to their many powers of<br>illusion, ascended the skies and began to fight with us thence, our<br>encounter with them ceased to be an equal one. Defeat then was ours and<br>even captivity. And afflicted with sorrow, we along with our attendants<br>and counsellors and children and wives and troops and vehicles were being<br>taken by them through the skies. It was then that some soldiers of ours<br>and some brave officers repaired in grief unto the sons of Pandu&#8212;those<br>heroes that never refuse succour to those that ask for it. And having<br>gone to them they said, 'Here is king Duryodhana, the son of<br>Dhritarashtra, who with his younger brothers and friends and wives is<br>being led away a captive by the Gandharvas along the sky. Blest be ye.<br>Liberate the king along with the women of the royal household! Suffer no<br>insult to be offered unto all the ladies of the Kuru race. And when they<br>had spoken thus, the eldest of Pandu's sons, who is endued with a<br>virtuous soul then conciliated his brothers and commanded them to<br>liberate us. Then those bulls among men, the Pandavas, overtaking the<br>Gandharvas, solicited our release in soft words, although fully able to<br>effect it by force of arms. And when the Gandharvas, addressed in such<br>conciliatory words, refused to set us at liberty, then Arjuna and Bhima<br>and the twins endued with mighty energy, shot showers of arrows at the<br>Gandharvas. Then the Gandharvas, abandoning the fight, fled through the<br>sky, dragging our melancholy selves after them, filled with joy. Then we<br>beheld a network of arrows spread all around by Dhananjaya, who was also<br>shooting celestial weapons upon the foe. And seeing the points of the<br>horizon covered by Arjuna with a thick network of sharp arrows, his<br>friend, the chief of the Gandharvas, showed himself. And Chitrasena and<br>Arjuna, embracing each other, enquired after each other's welfare. And<br>the other sons of Pandu also embraced the chief of the Gandharvas and<br>were embraced by him. And enquiries of courtesy passed between them also.<br>And the brave Gandharvas then abandoning their weapons and mail mingled<br>in a friendly spirit with the Pandavas. And Chitrasena and Dhananjaya<br>worshipped each other with regard."
