                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O great Brahmana, how was that tiger among kings,<br>Mandhata, Yuvanaswa's son, born,&#8212;even he who was the best of monarchs,<br>and celebrated over the three worlds? And how did he of unmeasured lustre<br>attain the very height of real power, since all the three worlds were as<br>much under his subjection, as they are under that of Vishnu of mighty<br>soul? I am desirous of hearing all this in connection with the life and<br>achievements of that sagacious monarch. I should also like to hear how<br>his name of Mandhata originated, belonging as it did to him who rivalled<br>in lustre Indra himself: and also how he of unrivalled strength was born,<br>for thou art skilled in the art of narrating events.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'Hear with attention, O king! how the name of Mandhata<br>belonging to that monarch of mighty soul hath come to be celebrated<br>throughout all the worlds. Yuvanaswa, the ruler of the earth, was sprung<br>from Ikshvaku's race. That protector of the earth performed many<br>sacrificial rites noted for magnificent gifts. And the most excellent of<br>all virtuous men performed a thousand times the ceremony of sacrificing a<br>horse. And he also performed other sacrifices of the highest order,<br>wherein he made abundant gifts. But that saintly king had no son. And he<br>of mighty soul and rigid vows made over to his ministers the duties of<br>the state, and became a constant resident of the woods. And he of<br>cultured soul devoted himself to the pursuits enjoined in the sacred<br>writ. And once upon a time, that protector of men, O king! had observed a<br>fast. And he was suffering from the pangs of hunger and his inner soul<br>seemed parched with thirst. And (in this state) he entered the hermitage<br>of Bhrigu. On that very night, O king of kings! the great saint who was<br>the delight of Bhrigu's race, had officiated in a religious ceremony,<br>with the object that a son might be born to Saudyumni. O king of kings!<br>at the spot stood a large jar filled with water, consecrated with the<br>recitation of sacred hymns, and which had been previously deposited<br>there. And the water was endued with the virtue that the wife of<br>Saudyumni would by drinking the same, bring forth a god-like son. Those<br>mighty saints had deposited the jar on the altar and had gone to sleep,<br>having been fatigued by keeping up the night. And as Saudyumni passed<br>them by, his palate was dry, and he was suffering greatly from thirst.<br>And the king was very much in need of water to drink. And he entered that<br>hermitage and asked for drink. And becoming fatigued, he cried in feeble<br>voice, proceeding from a parched throat, which resembled the weak<br>inarticulate utterance of a bird. And his voice reached nobody's ears.<br>Then the king beheld the jar filled with water. And he quickly ran<br>towards it, and having drunk the water, put the jar down. And as the<br>water was cool, and as the king had been suffering greatly from thirst,<br>the draught of water relieved the sagacious monarch and appeased his<br>thirst. Then those saints together with him of ascetic wealth, awoke from<br>sleep; and all of them observed that the water of the jar had gone.<br>Thereupon they met together and began to enquire as to who might have<br>done it. Then Yuvanaswa truthfully admitted that it was his act. Then the<br>revered son of Bhrigu spoke unto him, saying. 'It was not proper. This<br>water had an occult virtue infused into it, and had been placed there<br>with the object that a son might be born to thee. Having performed severe<br>austerities, I infused the virtue of my religious acts in this water,<br>that a son might be born to thee. O saintly king of mighty valour and<br>physical strength! a son would have been born to thee of exceeding<br>strength and valour, and strengthened by austerities, and who would have<br>sent by his bravery even Indra to the abode of the god of death. It was<br>in this manner, O king! that this water had been prepared by me. By<br>drinking this water, O king, thou hast done what was not at all right.<br>But it is impossible now for us to turn back the accident which hath<br>happened. Surely what thou hast done must have been the fiat of Fate.<br>Since thou, O great king, being a thirst hast drunk water prepared with<br>sacred hymns, and filled with the virtue of my religious labours, thou<br>must bring forth out of thy own body a son of the character described<br>above. To that end we shall perform a sacrifice for thee, of wonderful<br>effect so that, valorous as thou art, thou wilt bring forth a son equal<br>to Indra. Nor with thou experience any trouble on account of the labour<br>pains.' Then when one hundred years had passed away, a son shining as the<br>sun pierced the left side of the king endowed with a mighty soul, and<br>came forth. And the son was possessed of mighty strength. Nor did<br>Yuvanaswa die&#8212;which itself was strange. Then Indra of mighty strength<br>came to pay him a visit. And the deities enquired of the great Indra,<br>'What is to be sucked by this boy?' Then Indra introduced his own<br>forefinger into his mouth. And when the wielder of the thunderbolt said,<br>'He will suck me,' the dwellers of heaven together with Indra christened<br>the boy Mandhata, (literally, Me he shall suck). Then the boy having<br>tasted the forefinger extended by Indra, became possessed of mighty<br>strength, and he grew thirteen cubits, O king. And O great king! the<br>whole of sacred learning together with the holy science of arms, was<br>acquired by that masterful boy, who gained all that knowledge by the<br>simple and unassisted power of his thought. And all at once, the bow<br>celebrated under the name of Ajagava and a number of shafts made of horn,<br>together with an impenetrable coat of mail, came to his possession on the<br>very same day, O scion of Bharata's race! And he was placed on the throne<br>by Indra himself and he conquered the three worlds in a righteous way, as<br>Vishnu did by his three strides. And the wheel of the car of that mighty<br>king as irresistible in its course (throughout the world). And the gems,<br>of their own accord, came into the possession of that saintly king. This<br>is the tract of land, O lord of earth, which belonged to him. It abounds<br>in wealth. He performed a number of sacrificial rites of various kinds,<br>in which abundant gratuities were paid to the priests. O king! he of<br>mighty force and unmeasured lustre, erected sacred piles, and performed<br>splendid pious deeds, and attained the position of sitting at Indra's<br>side. That sagacious king of unswerving piety sent forth his fiat, and<br>simply by its virtue conquered the earth, together with the sea&#8212;that<br>source of gems&#8212;and all the cities (or [of?&#8212;JBH] the earth), O great<br>king! The sacrificial grounds prepared by him were to be found all over<br>the earth on all sides round&#8212;not a single spot, but was marked with the<br>same. O great king! the mighty monarch is said to have given to the<br>Brahmanas ten thousand padmas of kine. When there was a drought, which<br>continued for twelve consecutive years, the mighty king caused rain to<br>come down for the growth of crops, paying no heed to Indra, the wielder<br>of the thunder-bolt, who remained staring (at him). The mighty ruler of<br>the Gandhara land, born in the lunar dynasty of kings, who was terrible<br>like a a roaring cloud, was slain by him, who wounded him sorely with his<br>shafts. O king! he of cultured soul protected the four orders of people,<br>and by him of mighty force the worlds were kept from harm, by virtue of<br>his austere and righteous life. This is the spot where he, lustrous like<br>the sun, sacrificed to the god. Look at it! here it is, in the midst of<br>the field of the Kurus, situated in a tract, the holiest of all. O<br>preceptor of earth! requested by thee, I have thus narrated to thee the<br>great life of Mandhata, and also the way in which he was born, which was<br>a birth of an extraordinary kind.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "O scion of Bharata's race! Kunti's son, thus<br>addressed by the mighty saint, Lomasa, immediately put fresh questions to<br>him, with regard to Somaka."
