                            "Vrihadaswa said, 'After Varshneya had gone away, Pushkara won from the<br>righteous Nala that latter's kingdom and what else of wealth he had. And<br>unto Nala, O king, who had lost his kingdom, Pushkara laughingly said,<br>'Let the play go on. But what stake hast thou now? Damayanti only<br>remaineth; all else of thine hath been won by me. Well, if thou likest,<br>that Damayanti be our stake now.' Hearing these words of Pushkara the<br>virtuous king felt as if his heart would burst in rage, but he spake not<br>a word. And gazing at Pushkara in anguish, king Nala of great fame took<br>all the ornaments off every part of his body. And attired in a single<br>piece of cloth, his body uncovered, renouncing all his wealth, and<br>enhancing the grief of friends, the king set out. And Damayanti, clad in<br>one piece of cloth, followed him behind as he was leaving the city. And<br>coming to the outskirts of the city, Nala stayed there for three nights<br>with his wife. But Pushkara, O king, proclaimed through the city that he<br>that should show any attention to Nala, would be doomed to death. And on<br>account of these words of Pushkara and knowing his malice towards Nala,<br>the citizens, O Yudhishthira, no longer showed him hospitable regards.<br>And unregarded though deserving of hospitable regards, Nala passed three<br>nights in the outskirts of the city, living on water alone. And afflicted<br>with hunger, the king went away in search of fruit and roots, Damayanti<br>following him behind. And in agony of famine, after many days, Nala saw<br>some birds with plumage of golden hue. And thereupon the mighty lord of<br>the Nishadhas thought within himself, 'These will be my banquet today and<br>also my wealth.' And then he covered them with the cloth he had on&#8212;when<br>bearing up that garment of his, the birds rose up to the sky. And<br>beholding Nala nude and melancholy, and standing with face turned towards<br>the ground, those rangers of the sky addressed him, saying, 'O thou of<br>small sense, we are even those dice. We had come hither wishing to take<br>away thy cloth, for it pleased us not that thou shouldst depart even with<br>thy cloth on.' And finding himself deprived of his attire, and knowing<br>also that the dice were departing (with it), the virtuous Nala, O king,<br>thus spake unto Damayanti, 'O faultless one, they through whose anger I<br>have been despoiled of my kingdom, they through whose influence<br>distressed and afflicted with hunger, I am unable to procure sustenance,<br>they for whom the Nishadhas offered me not any hospitality, they, O timid<br>one, are carrying off my cloth, assuming the form of birds. Fallen into<br>this dire disaster, I am afflicted with grief and deprived of my senses,<br>I am thy lord, do thou, therefore, listen to the words I speak for thy<br>good. These many roads lead to the southern country, passing by (the city<br>of) Avanti and the Rikshavat mountains. This is that mighty mountain<br>called Vindhya; yon, the river Payasvini running sea-wards, and yonder<br>are the asylums of the ascetics, furnished with various fruit and roots.<br>This road leadeth to the country of the Vidarbhas&#8212;and that, to the<br>country of the Kosalas. Beyond these roads to the south is the southern<br>country.' Addressing Bhima's daughter, O Bharata, he distressed king Nala<br>spake those words unto Damayanti over and over again. Thereupon afflicted<br>with grief, in a voice choked with tears, Damayanti spake unto Naishadha<br>these piteous words, 'O king, thinking of thy purpose, my heart<br>trembleth, and all my limbs become faint. How can I go, leaving thee in<br>the lone woods despoiled of thy kingdom and deprived of thy wealth,<br>thyself without a garment on, and worn with hunger and toil? When in the<br>deep woods, fatigued and afflicted with hunger, thou thinkest of thy<br>former bliss, I will, O great monarch, soothe thy weariness. In every<br>sorrow there is no physic equal unto the wife, say the physicians. It is<br>the truth, O Nala, that I speak unto thee.' Hearing those words of his<br>queen, Nala replied, 'O slender-waisted Damayanti, it is even as thou<br>hast said. To a man in distress, there is no friend or medicine that is<br>equal unto a wife. But I do not seek to renounce thee, wherefore, O timid<br>one, dost thou dread this? O faultless one, I can forsake myself but thee<br>I cannot forsake.' Damayanti then said, 'If thou dost not, O mighty king,<br>intend to forsake me, why then dost thou point out to me the way to the<br>country of the Vidarbhas? I know, O king, that thou wouldst not desert<br>me. But, O lord of the earth, considering that thy mind is distracted,<br>thou mayst desert me. O best of men, thou repeatedly pointest out to me<br>the way and it is by this, O god-like one, that thou enhancest my grief.<br>If it is thy intention that I should go to my relatives, then if it<br>pleaseth thee, both of us will wend to the country of the Vidarbhas. O<br>giver of honours, there the king of the Vidarbhas will receive thee with<br>respect. And honoured by him, O king, thou shall live happily in our<br>home.'"
