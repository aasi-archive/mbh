                            Janamejaya said, "After his defeat and capture by the foe and his<br>subsequent liberation by the illustrious sons of Pandu by force of arms,<br>it seemeth to me that the entry into Hastinapura of the proud, wicked,<br>boastful, vicious, insolent, and wretched Duryodhana, engaged in<br>insulting the sons of Pandu and bragging of his own superiority, must<br>have been exceedingly difficult. Describe to me in detail, O<br>Vaisampayana, the entry into the capital, of that prince overwhelmed with<br>shame and unmanned by grief!"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Dismissed by the king Yudhishthira the just,<br>Dhritarashtra's son Suyodhana, bending his head down in shame and<br>afflicted with grief and melancholy, set out slowly. And the king,<br>accompanied by his four kinds of forces, proceeded towards his city, his<br>heart rent in grief and filled with thoughts of his defeat along the way<br>in a region that abounded in grass and water. The king encamped on a<br>delightful piece of ground as pleased him best, with his elephants and<br>cars and cavalry and infantry stationed all around. And as the king<br>Duryodhana was seated on an elevated bedstead endued with the effulgence<br>of fire, himself looking like the moon under an eclipse, towards the<br>small hours of the morning Karna, approaching him, said, 'Fortunate it<br>is, O son of Gandhari, that thou art alive! Fortunate it is, that we have<br>once more met! By good luck it is that thou hast vanquished the<br>Gandharvas capable of assuming any form at will. And, O son of the Kuru<br>race, it is by good luck alone, that I am enabled to see thy brothers&#8212;<br>mighty warriors all&#8212;come off victorious from that encounter, having<br>subjugated their foes! As regards myself, assailed by all the Gandharvas,<br>I fled before thy eyes, unable to rally our flying host. Assailed by the<br>foe with all his might, my body mangled with their arrows, I sought<br>safety in flight. This however, O Bharata, seemed to me to be a great<br>marvel that I behold you all come safe and sound in body, with your<br>wives, troops, and vehicles, out of that super-human encounter. O<br>Bharata, there is another man in this world who can achieve what thou, O<br>king, hast achieved in battle to-day with thy brothers."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed by Karna, king Duryodhana replied<br>unto the ruler of the Angas in a voice choked with tears."
