                            Vaisampayana said, "When that foremost of monkeys had gone away, Bhima,<br>the best of strong men, began to range the huge Gandhamadana along that<br>path. And he went on, thinking of Hanuman's body and splendour unrivalled<br>on earth, and also of the greatness and dignity of Dasaratha's son. And<br>proceeding in search of the place filled with lotuses of that kind, Bhima<br>beheld romantic woods, and groves, and rivers, and lakes graced with<br>trees bearing blossoms, and flowery woodlands variegated with various<br>flowers. And, O Bharata, he beheld herds of mad elephants besmeared with<br>mud, resembling masses of pouring clouds. And that graceful one went on<br>with speed, beholding by the wayside woods wherein there stood with their<br>mates deer of quick glances, holding the grass in their mouths. And<br>fearless from prowess, Bhimasena, as if invited by the breeze-shaken<br>trees of the forest ever fragrant with flowers, bearing delicate coppery<br>twigs, plunged into the mountainous regions inhabited by buffaloes, bears<br>and leopards. And on the way, he passed by lotus-lakes haunted by<br>maddened black-bees, having romantic descents and woods, and on account<br>of the presence of lotus-buds, appearing as if they had joined their<br>hands (before Bhima). And having for his provisions on the journey the<br>words of Draupadi, Bhima went on with speed, his mind and sight fixed on<br>the blooming slopes of the mountain. And when the sun passed the<br>meridian, he saw in the forest scattered over with deer, a mighty river<br>filled with fresh golden lotuses. And being crowded with swans and<br>Karandavas, and graced with Chakravakas, the river looked like a garland<br>of fresh lotuses put on by the mountain. And in that river that one of<br>great strength found the extensive assemblage of Saugandhika lotuses,<br>effulgent as the rising sun, and delightful to behold. And beholding it,<br>Pandu's son thought within himself that his object had been gained, and<br>also mentally presented himself before his beloved worn out by exile."
