                            Vaisampayana said, "Then when the night had been spent, Dhananjaya,<br>together with his brothers, paid homage unto Yudhishthira the just. And,<br>O Bharata, at this moment, proceeding from the celestials there arose<br>mighty and tremendous sounds of a musical instrument, and the rattling of<br>car-wheels, and the tolling of bells. And there at all the beasts and<br>beasts of prey and birds emitted separate cries. And from all sides in<br>cars resplendent as the sun, hosts of Gandharvas and Apsaras began to<br>follow that represser of foes, the lord of the celestials. And ascending<br>a car yoked with steeds, decorated with burnished gold, and roaring like<br>clouds, that king of the celestials, Purandara blazing in beauty came<br>unto the Parthas. And having arrived (at that place), he of a thousand<br>eyes descended from his car. And as soon as Yudhishthira the just saw<br>that high-souled one, he together with his brothers, approached that<br>graceful king of the immortals. And in accordance with the ordinance that<br>generous one duly worshipped him of immeasurable soul, in consequence<br>with his dignity. And then Dhananjaya possessed of prowess, having bowed<br>down unto Purandara, stood before the lord of the celestials in humble<br>guise, like unto a servant. And seeing the sinless Dhananjaya having<br>ascetic merit, bearing clotted hair, stand in humility before the lord of<br>celestials, Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti; of great energy, smelt (the<br>crown) of his head. And beholding Phalguna (in that attitude), he was<br>exceedingly glad; and by worshipping the king of the celestials, he<br>experienced the highest bliss. Then unto that strongminded monarch,<br>swimming in felicity, the intelligent lord of the celestials, Purandara,<br>spake, saying, Thou shalt rule the earth, O Pandava, Blessed be thou! Do<br>thou, O Kunti's son, again repair unto Kamyaka.'"That learned man who for<br>a year leading the Brahmacharya mode of life, subduing his senses and<br>observing vows, peruseth with rapt attention this meeting of Sakra with<br>the Pandavas, liveth a hundred years free from disturbances, and enjoying<br>happiness."'
