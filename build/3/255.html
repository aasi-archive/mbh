                            Vaisampayana said, "While, O great king, Duryodhana was entering (the<br>city), the panegyrists eulogized the prince of unfailing prowess. And<br>others also eulogized that mighty bowman and foremost of kings. And<br>sprinkling over him fried paddy and sandal paste the citizens said, 'By<br>good luck it is, O king, that thy sacrifice hath been completed without<br>obstruction.' And some, more reckless of speech, that were present there,<br>said unto that lord of the earth, 'Surely this thy sacrifice cannot be<br>compared with Yudhishthira's: nor doth this come up to a sixteenth part<br>of that (sacrifice).' Thus spake unto that king some that were reckless<br>of consequences. His friends, however, said, This sacrifice of thine hath<br>surpassed all others. Yayati and Nahusha, and Mandhata and Bharata,<br>having been sanctified by celebrating such a sacrifice, have all gone to<br>heaven.' Hearing such agreeable words from his friends, that monarch, O<br>bull of the Bharata's race, well-pleased, entered the city and finally<br>his own abode. Then, O king, worshipping the feet of his father and<br>mother and of others headed by Bhishma, Drona and Kripa, and of the wise<br>Vidura, and worshipped in turn by his younger brothers, that delighter of<br>brothers sat down upon an excellent seat, surrounded by the latter. And<br>the Suta's son, rising up, said, 'By good luck it is, O foremost of the<br>Bharata race, that this mighty sacrifice of thine hath been brought to a<br>close. When, however, the sons of Pritha shall have been slain in battle<br>and thou wilt have completed the Rajasuya sacrifice, once again, O lord<br>of men, shall I honour thee thus.' Then that mighty king, the illustrious<br>son of Dhritarashtra, replied unto him, 'Truly hath this been spoken by<br>thee. When, O foremost of men, the wicked-minded Pandavas have been<br>slain, and when also the grand Rajasuya hath been celebrated by me, then<br>thou shalt again, O hero, honour me thus.' And having said this, O<br>Bharata, the Kaurava embraced Karna, and began, O mighty king, to think<br>of the Rajasuya, that foremost of sacrifices. And that best of kings also<br>addressed the Kurus around him, saying, 'When shall I, ye Kauravas,<br>having slain all the Pandavas, celebrate that costly and foremost of<br>sacrifices, the Rajasuya.' Then spake Karna unto him, saying, 'Hear me, O<br>elephant among kings! So long as I do not slay Arjuna, I shall not allow<br>any one to wash my feet, nor shall I taste meat. And I shall observe the<br>Asura vow[84] and whoever may solicit me (for any thing), I never shall<br>say, 'I have it not.' When Karna had thus vowed to slay Phalguna in<br>battle, those mighty charioteers and bowmen, the sons of Dhritarashtra,<br>sent up a loud cheer; and Dhritarashtra's sons thought that the Pandavas<br>had already been conquered. Then that chief of kings, the graceful<br>Duryodhana, leaving those bulls among men, entered his apartment, like<br>the lord Kuvera entering the garden of Chitraratha. And all those mighty<br>bowmen also, O Bharata, went to their respective quarters.<br><br>"Meanwhile those mighty bowmen, the Pandavas, excited by the words the<br>messenger had spoken, became anxious, and they did not (from that time)<br>experience the least happiness. Intelligence, further, O foremost of<br>kings, had been brought by spies regarding the vow of the Suta's son to<br>slay Vijaya. Hearing this, O lord of men, Dharma's son became exceedingly<br>anxious. And considering Karna of the impenetrable mail to be of<br>wonderful prowess, and remembering all their woes, he knew no peace. And<br>that high-souled one filled with anxiety, made up his mind to abandon the<br>woods about Dwaitavana abounding with ferocious animals.<br><br>"Meanwhile the royal son of Dhritarashtra began to rule the earth, along<br>with his heroic brothers as also with Bhishma and Drona and Kripa. And<br>with the assistance of the Suta's son crowned with martial glory,<br>Duryodhana remained ever intent on the welfare of the rulers of the<br>earth, and he worshipped the foremost of Brahmanas by celebrating<br>sacrifices with profuse gifts. And that hero and subduer of foes, O king,<br>was engaged in doing good to his brothers, concluding for certain in his<br>mind that giving and enjoying are the only use of riches."
