                            "The Danavas said, 'O Suyodhana, O great king? O perpetuator of the race<br>of Bharata, thou art ever surrounded by heroes and illustrious men. Why<br>hast thou, then, undertaken to do such a rash act as the vow of<br>starvation? The suicide ever sinketh into hell and becometh the subject<br>of calumnious speech. Nor do intelligent persons like thee ever set their<br>hands to acts that are sinful and opposed to their best interests and<br>striking at the very root of their purposes. Restrain this resolve of<br>thine, therefore, O king, which is destructive of morality, profit, and<br>happiness, of fame, prowess, and energy, and which enhanceth the joy of<br>foes O exalted king, know the truth, the celestial origin of thy soul,<br>and the maker of thy body, and then summon thou patience to thy aid. In<br>days of old. O king, we have obtained thee, by ascetic austerities from<br>Maheswara. The upper part of thy body is wholly made of an assemblage of<br>Vajras, and is, therefore, invulnerable to weapons of every description,<br>O sinless one. The lower part of thy body, capable of captivating the<br>female heart by its comeliness was made of flowers by the goddess<br>herself&#8212;the wife of Mahadeva. Thy body is thus, O best of kings, the<br>creation of Maheswara himself and his goddess. Therefore, O tiger among<br>kings, thou art of celestial origin, not human. Other brave Kshatriyas of<br>mighty energy headed by Bhagadatta, and all acquainted with celestial<br>weapons, will slay thy foes. Therefore, let this grief of thine cease.<br>Thou hast no cause for fear. For aiding thee, many heroic Danavas have<br>been born on the earth. Other Asuras will also possess Bhishma and Drona<br>and Kama and others. Possessed by those Asuras, these heroes will cast<br>away their kindness and fight with thy foes. Indeed, when the Danavas<br>will enter their heart and possess them completely, flinging all<br>affections to a distance, becoming hard-hearted, these warriors will<br>strike every body opposed to them in battle without sparing sons,<br>brothers, fathers, friends, disciples, relatives, even children and old<br>men. Blinded by ignorance and wrath, and impelled by that destiny which<br>hath been ordained by the Creator, these tigers among men, with hearts<br>steeped in sin, will, O thou foremost of the Kurus, depopulate the earth<br>by hurling and shooting all kinds of weapons, with great manliness and<br>strength and always addressing one another boastfully with words such as<br>these, 'Thou shall not escape from me today with life.' And these<br>illustrious sons of Pandu also, five in number, will fight with these.<br>And, endued with mighty strength and favoured by Fate, they will compass<br>the destruction of these. And, O king, many Daityas and Rakshasas also<br>that have been born in the Kshatriya order, will fight with great prowess<br>in the battle with thy foes, using maces and clubs and lances and various<br>weapons of a superior kind. And, O hero, with respect to the fear that is<br>in thy heart rising from Arjuna, we have already settled the means for<br>slaying Arjuna. The soul of the slain Naraka hath assumed the form of<br>Karna. Recollecting his former hostility he will encounter both Kesava<br>and Arjuna. And that mighty warrior and foremost of smiters, proud of his<br>prowess will vanquish Arjuna in battle as also all thy enemies. The<br>wielder of the thunder-bolt, knowing all this, and desirous of saving<br>Arjuna, will in disguise take away from Karna his ear-rings and coat of<br>mail. We also have for that reason appointed hundreds upon hundreds and<br>thousands upon thousands of Daityas and Rakshasas, viz., those that are<br>known by the name of Samsaptakas.[83] These celebrated warriors will slay<br>the heroic Arjuna. Therefore, grieve not, O king. Thou wilt rule the<br>whole earth, O monarch, without a rival. Do not yield to despondency.<br>Conduct such as this does not suit thee. O thou of the Kuru race, if thou<br>diest, our party becometh weak. Go thou, O hero, and let not thy mind be<br>directed to any other course of action. Thou art ever our refuge as,<br>indeed, the Pandavas are the refuge of the gods.'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having addressed him thus, those Daityas<br>embraced that elephant among kings, and those bulls among the Danavas<br>cheered that irrepressible one like a son. And, O Bharata, pacifying his<br>mind by soft speech, they permitted him to depart, saying, 'Go and attain<br>victory!' And when they had given leave to the mighty-armed one, that<br>very goddess carried him back to the spot where he had sat down, intent<br>upon putting an end to his life. And having set that hero down and paid<br>him homage, the goddess vanished, taking the king's permission. O<br>Bharata, when she had gone, king Duryodhana considered all (that had<br>happened) as a dream. He then thought within himself, 'I shall defeat the<br>Pandavas in battle.' And Suyodhana thought that Karna and the Samsaptaka<br>army were both able (to destroy) and intent upon destroying that slayer<br>of foes, Partha. Thus, O bull of the Bharata race, the hope was<br>strengthened of the wicked minded son of Dhritarashtra, of conquering the<br>Pandavas. And Karna also, his soul and faculties possessed by the inmost<br>soul of Naraka, had at that time cruelly determined to slay Arjuna. And<br>those heroes&#8212;the Samsaptakas also&#8212;having their sense possessed by the<br>Rakshasas, and influenced by the qualities of emotion and darkness, were<br>desirous of slaying Phalguna. And, O king, others with Bhishma, Drona,<br>and Kripa at their head, having their faculties influenced by the<br>Danavas, were not so affectionate towards the sons of Pandu as they had<br>been. But king Suyodhana did not tell any one of this.<br><br>"When the night passed away, Karna, that offspring of the Sun, with<br>joined hands, smilingly addressed these wise words to king Duryodhana,<br>'No dead man conquereth his foes: it is when he is alive that he can see<br>his good. Where is the good of the dead person; and, O Kauraveya, where<br>is his victory? Therefore, this is no time for grief, or fear or death.'<br>And having, with his arms embraced that mighty-armed one, he further<br>said, 'Rise up, O king! Why dost thou lie down? Why dost thou grieve, O<br>slayer of foes? Having afflicted thy enemies by thy prowess, why dost<br>thou wish for death? Or (perhaps) fear hath possessed thee at the sight<br>of Arjuna's prowess. I truly promise unto thee that I will slay Arjuna in<br>battle. O lord of men, I swear by my weapon that when the three and ten<br>years shall have passed away, I will bring the sons of Pritha under thy<br>subjection.' Thus addressed by Karna, and remembering the words of the<br>Daityas and supplications made by them (his brothers), Suyodhana rose up.<br>And having heard those words of the Daityas that tiger among men, with a<br>firm resolve in his heart arrayed his army, abounding in horses and<br>elephants and cars and infantry. And, O monarch, immensely swarming with<br>white umbrellas, and pennons, and white Chamaras, and cars, and<br>elephants, and foot-soldiers, that mighty army, as it moved like the<br>waters of the Ganga, looked graceful like the firmament, at a season when<br>the clouds have dispersed and the signs of autumn have been but partially<br>developed. And, O foremost of kings, eulogised like a monarch by the best<br>of the Brahmanas blessing with victory, that lord of men Suyodhana,<br>Dhritarashtra's son, receiving honours paid with innumerable joined<br>palms, and flaming in exceeding splendour, went in the front, accompanied<br>by Karna, and that gambler, the son of Suvala. And all his brothers with<br>Dussasana at their head, and Bhurisrava, and Somadatta, and the mighty<br>king Vahlika, followed that lion among kings on his way, with cars of<br>various forms, and horses, and the best of elephants. And, O prime among<br>monarchs, in a short time, those perpetuators of the Kuru race entered<br>their own city."
