                            (Indralokagamana Parva)<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "After the Lokapalas had gone away, Arjuna&#8212;that<br>slayer of all foes&#8212;began to think, O monarch, of the car of Indra! And<br>as Gudakesa gifted with great intelligence was thinking of it, the car<br>endued with great effulgence and guided by Matali, came dividing the<br>clouds and illuminating the firmament and filling the entire welkin with<br>its rattle deep as the roar of mighty masses of clouds. Swords, and<br>missiles of terrible forms and maces of frightful description, and winged<br>darts of celestials splendour and lightnings of the brightest effulgence,<br>and thunderbolts, and propellors furnished with wheels and worked with<br>atmosphere expansion and producing sounds loud as the roar of great<br>masses of clouds, were on that car. And there were also on that car<br>fierce and huge-bodied Nagas with fiery mouths, and heaps of stones white<br>as the fleecy clouds. And the car was drawn by ten thousands of horses of<br>golden hue, endued with the speed of the wind. And furnished with prowess<br>of illusion, the car was drawn with such speed that the eye could hardly<br>mark its progress. And Arjuna saw on that car the flag-staff called<br>Vaijayanta, of blazing effulgence, resembling in hue the emerald or the<br>dark-blue lotus, and decked with golden ornaments and straight as the<br>bamboo. And beholding a charioteer decked in gold seated on that car, the<br>mighty-armed son of Pritha regarded it as belonging to the celestials.<br>And while Arjuna was occupied with his thoughts regarding the car, the<br>charioteer Matali, bending himself after descending from the car,<br>addressed him, saying, 'O lucky son of Sakra! Sakra himself wisheth to<br>see thee. Ascend thou without loss of time this car that hath been sent<br>by Indra. The chief of the immortals, thy father&#8212;that god of a hundred<br>sacrifices&#8212;hath commanded me, saying, 'Bring the son of Kunti hither.<br>Let the gods behold him.' And Sankara himself, surrounded by the<br>celestials and Rishis and Gandharvas and Apsaras, waiteth to behold thee.<br>At the command of the chastiser of Paka, therefore, ascend thou with me<br>from this to the region of the celestials. Thou wilt return after<br>obtaining weapons.'"<br><br>"Arjuna replied, 'O Matali, mount thou without loss of time this<br>excellent car, a car that cannot be attained even by hundreds of Rajasuya<br>and horse sacrifices. Even kings of great prosperity who have performed<br>great sacrifices distinguished by large gifts (to Brahmanas), even gods<br>and Danavas are not competent to ride this car. He that hath not ascetic<br>merit is not competent to even see or touch this car, far less to ride on<br>it. O blessed one, after thou hast ascended, it, and after the horses<br>have become still, I will ascend it, like a virtuous man stepping into<br>the high-road of honesty.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Matali, the charioteer of Sakra, hearing these<br>words of Arjuna, soon mounted the car and controlled the horses. Arjuna<br>then, with a cheerful heart, purified himself by a bath in the Ganges.<br>And the son of Kunti then duly repeated (inaudibly) his customary<br>prayers. He then, duly and according to the ordinance, gratified the<br>Pitris with oblations of water. And, lastly, he commenced to invoke the<br>Mandara&#8212;that king of mountains&#8212;saying, 'O mountain, thou art ever the<br>refuge of holy, heaven-seeking Munis of virtuous conduct and behaviour.<br>It is through thy grace, O mountain, that Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and<br>Vaisyas attain heaven, and their anxieties gone, sport with the<br>celestials. O king of mountains, O mountain, thou art the asylum of<br>Munis, and thou holdest on thy breast numerous sacred shrines. Happily<br>have I dwelt on thy heights. I leave thee now, bidding thee farewell. Oft<br>have I seen thy tablelands and bowers, thy springs and brooks, and the<br>sacred shrines on thy breast. I have also eaten the savoury fruits<br>growing on thee, and have slated my thirst with draughts of perfumed<br>water oozing from the body. I have also drunk the water of thy springs,<br>sweet as amrita itself. O mountain, as a child sleepeth happily on the<br>lap of his father, so have I, O king of mountains, O excellent one,<br>sported on thy breast, echoing with the notes of Apsaras and the chanting<br>of the Vedas. O mountain, every day have I lived happily on thy<br>tablelands.' Thus having bidden farewell to the mountain, that slayer of<br>hostile heroes&#8212;Arjuna&#8212;blazing like the Sun himself, ascended the<br>celestial car. And the Kuru prince gifted with great intelligence, with a<br>glad heart, coursed through the firmament on that celestial car effulgent<br>as the sun and of extra-ordinary achievements. And after he had become<br>invisible to the mortals of the earth, he beheld thousands of cars of<br>extra-ordinary beauty. And in that region there was no sun or moon or<br>fire to give light, but it blazed in light of its own, generated by<br>virtue of ascetic merit. And those brilliant regions that are seen from<br>the earth in the form of stars, like lamps (in the sky)&#8212;so small in<br>consequence of their distance, though very large&#8212;were beheld by the son<br>of Pandu, stationed in their respective places, full of beauty and<br>effulgence and blazing with splendour all their own. And there he beheld<br>royal sages crowned with ascetic success, and heroes who had yielded up<br>their lives in battle, and those that had acquired heaven by their<br>ascetic austerities, by hundreds upon hundreds. And there were also<br>Gandharvas, of bodies blazing like the sun, by thousands upon thousands,<br>as also Guhyakas and Rishis and numerous tribes of Apsaras. And beholding<br>those self-effulgent regions, Phalguna became filled with wonder, and<br>made enquiries of Matali. And Matali also gladly replied unto him,<br>saying, 'These, O son of Pritha, are virtuous persons stationed in their<br>respective places. It is these whom thou hast seen, O exalted one, as<br>stars, from the earth.' Then Arjuna saw standing at the gates (Indra's<br>region) the handsome and ever victorious elephant&#8212;Airavata&#8212;furnished<br>with four tusks, and resembling the mountain of Kailasa with its summits.<br>And coursing along that path of the Siddhas, that foremost of the Kurus<br>and the son of Pandu, sat in beauty like Mandhata&#8212;that best of kings.<br>Endued with eyes like lotus leaves, he passed through the region set<br>apart for virtuous kings. And the celebrated Arjuna having thus passed<br>through successive regions of heaven at last beheld Amaravati, the city<br>of Indra."
