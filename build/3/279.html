                            "Markandeya said, 'And while the chaste Sita was dwelling there afflicted<br>with melancholy and grief on account of her lord, attired in mean garb,<br>with but a single jewel (on the marital thread on her wrist), and<br>incessantly weeping, seated on a stone, and waited upon by Rakshasa<br>women, Ravana, afflicted by the shafts of the god of desire, came to her<br>and approached her presence. And inflamed by desire, that conquerer in<br>battle of the gods, the Danavas, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, and the<br>Kimpurushas, attired in celestial robes and possessing handsome features,<br>decked with jewelled earrings and wearing a beautiful garland and crown,<br>entered the Asoka woods, like an embodiment of the vernal season. And<br>dressed with care, Ravana looked like the Kalpa tree in Indra's garden.<br>But though adorned with every embellishment, that inspired her only with<br>awe, like a beautified banian in the midst of a cemetery. And that night<br>wanderer, having approached the presence of that slender-waisted lady,<br>looked like the planet Saturn in the presence of Rohini. And smitten with<br>the shafts of the god of the flowery emblem he accosted that fair-hipped<br>lady then affrighted like a helpless doe, and told her these words, 'Thou<br>hast, O Sita, shown thy regard for thy lord too much! O thou of delicate<br>limbs, be merciful unto me. Let thy person be embellished now (by these<br>maids in waiting). O excellent lady, accept me as thy lord! And, O thou<br>of the most beautiful complexion, attired in costly robes and ornaments,<br>take thou the first place among all the women of my household. Many are<br>the daughters of the celestials and also the Gandharvas that I possess! I<br>am lord also of many Danava and Daitya ladies! One hundred and forty<br>millions of Pisachas, twice as many man-eating Rakshasa of terrible deed,<br>and thrice as many Yaksha do my bidding! Some of these are under the sway<br>of my brother who is the lord of all treasures. In my drinking hall, O<br>excellent lady of beautiful thighs, Gandharvas and Apsaras wait on me as<br>they do on my brother! I am, again, the son of that regenerate Rishi<br>Visravas himself of high ascetic merit. I am renowned, again, as the<br>fifth Regent of the Universe! And, O beautiful lady, of food and edibles<br>and drinks of the very best kind, I have as much as the Lord himself of<br>the celestials! Let all thy troubles consequent on a life in the woods<br>cease! O thou of fair hips, be my Queen, as Mandodari herself!' Thus<br>addressed by him, the beautiful princess of Videha, turning away and<br>regarding him as something less than a straw, replied unto that wanderer<br>of the night. And at that time the princess of Videha, that girl of<br>beautiful hips, had her deep and compact bosom copiously drenched by her<br>inauspicious tears shed ceaselessly. And she who regarded her husband as<br>her god, answered that mean wretch, saying, 'By sheer ill-luck it is, O<br>king of the Rakshasas, that I am obliged to hear such words of grievous<br>import spoken by thee! Blessed be thou, O Rakshasa fond of sensual<br>pleasures, let thy heart be withdrawn from me! I am the wife of another,<br>ever devoted to my husband, and, therefore, incapable of being possessed<br>by thee! A helpless human being that I am, I cannot be a fit wife for<br>thee! What joy can be thine by using violence towards an unwilling woman?<br>Thy father is a wise Brahmana, born of Brahma and equal unto that Lord<br>himself of the creation! Why dost thou not, therefore, thyself being<br>equal to a Regent of the Universe, observe virtue? Disgracing thy<br>brother, that king of the Yakshas, that adorable one who is the friend of<br>Maheswara himself, that lord of treasures, how is it that thou feelest no<br>shame?' Having said these words, Sita began to weep, her bosom shivering<br>in agitation, and covering her neck and face with her garments. And the<br>long and well-knit braid, black and glossy, falling from the head of the<br>weeping lady, looked like a black snake. And hearing these cruel words<br>uttered by Sita, the foolish Ravana, although thus rejected, addressed<br>Sita once more, saying, 'O lady, let the god having the Makara for his<br>emblem burn me sorely. I will, however, on no account, O thou of sweet<br>smiles and beautiful hips, approach thee, as thou art unwilling! What can<br>I do to thee that still feelest a regard for Rama who is only a human<br>being and, therefore, our food?' Having said those words unto that lady<br>of faultless features, the king of the Rakshasa made himself invisible<br>then and there and went away to the place he liked. And Sita, surrounded<br>by those Rakshasa women, and treated with tenderness by Trijata,<br>continued to dwell there in grief."
