                            Vaisampayana said, "Those Brahmanas then, that had been dwelling (with<br>him) in the woods, beholding the son of Kunti about to set out (on the<br>pious pilgrimage), approached him, O king, and said, 'Thou art about to<br>set out, O king, on thy journey to the sacred tirthas, along with thy<br>brothers and accompanied by the illustrious Rishi Lomasa. O king, it<br>behoveth thee, O son of Pandu, to take us with thee. Without thee, we<br>shall not be able, O son of the Kuru race, to visit them at any time.<br>Surrounded by dangers and difficult of access, they are infested by<br>beasts of prey. Those tirthas, O lord of men, are inaccessible to persons<br>in small parties. Foremost of all wielders of the bow, thy brothers are<br>ever brave. Protected by your heroic selves, we also would proceed to<br>them. Permit us to acquire, O lord of earth, through thy grace the<br>blessed fruit of tirthas. Protected by thy energy, let us, O king, be<br>cleansed of all our sins by visiting those tirthas and purified by baths<br>therein. Bathing in those tirthas, thou also, O Bharata, wilt acquire<br>without doubt the regions difficult of acquisition that Kartavirya and<br>Ashtaka, the royal sage Lomapada and the imperial and heroic Bharata only<br>had earned. In thy company, O king, we desire to behold Prabhasa and<br>other tirthas, Mahendra and other hills, Ganga and other rivers, and<br>Plaksha and other gigantic trees. If, O lord of men, thou hast any regard<br>for the Brahmanas, do thou our bidding. Thou wilt surely have prosperity<br>from this. O thou of mighty arms, the tirthas are infested by Rakshasas<br>that ever obstruct ascetic penances. It behoveth thee to protect us from<br>them. Protected by Lomasa and taking us with thee, go thou to all the<br>tirthas spoken of by Dhaumya and the intelligent Narada, as also all<br>those that have been spoken of by the celestial Rishi Lomasa, endued with<br>great ascetic wealth, and be thou, by this, cleansed of all thy sins."<br><br>"Thus addressed respectfully by them, the king&#8212;that bull amongst the<br>sons of Pandu&#8212;surrounded by his heroic brothers headed by Bhima, with<br>tears of joy in his eyes, said unto all those ascetics, 'Let it be so.'<br>With the permission then of Lomasa, as also of his priest Dhaumya, that<br>foremost of Pandu's sons with soul under complete control, resolved,<br>along with his brothers and Drupada's daughter of faultless features, to<br>set out. Just at this time, the blessed Vyasa, as also Parvata and<br>Narada, all endued with high intelligence, came to Kamyaka for seeing the<br>son of Pandu. Beholding them, king Yudhishthira worshipped them with due<br>rites. And worshipped by the monarch thus, those blessed ones, addressing<br>Yudhishthira, said, 'O Yudhishthira, O Bhima, and ye twins, banish all<br>evil thoughts from your minds. Purify your hearts and then set out for<br>the tirthas. The Brahmanas have said that the observance of regulations<br>in respect of the body are called earthly vows, while efforts to purify<br>the heart, so that it may be free from evil thoughts, are called<br>spiritual vows. O king, the mind that is free from all evil thoughts is<br>highly pure. Purifying yourselves, therefore, harbouring only friendly<br>feelings for all, behold ye the tirthas. Observing earthly vows in<br>respect of your bodies and purifying your minds by spiritual vows, obtain<br>ye the fruits as recited, of pilgrimages."<br><br>"Saying, 'So be it,' the Pandavas with Krishna, caused those celestial<br>and human Rishis to perform the usual propitiatory ceremonies. And those<br>heroes, having worshipped the feet of Lomasa and Dwaipayana and Narada<br>and the celestial Rishi Parvata, O king, and accompanied by Dhaumya as<br>also the ascetics that had been residing with them in the woods, set out<br>on the day following the full moon of Agrahayana in which the<br>constellation Pushya was ascendant. Dressed in barks and hides, and with<br>matted lock on head, they were all cased in impenetrable mail and armed<br>with swords. And O Janamejaya, the heroic sons of Pandu with quivers and<br>arrows and scimitars and other weapons, and accompanied by Indrasena and<br>other attendants with fourteen and one cars, a number of cooks and<br>servants of other classes, set out with faces turned towards the east!"
