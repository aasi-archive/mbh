                            Vaisampayana continued, "The virtuous king Yudhishthira, having listened<br>to this excellent religious discourse, again addressed himself to the<br>rishi Markandeya saying, 'Why did the fire-god hide himself in water in<br>olden times, and why is it that Angiras of great splendour officiating as<br>fire-god, used to convey[60] oblations during his dissolution. There is<br>but one fire, but according to the nature of its action, it is seen to<br>divide itself into many. O worshipful sir, I long to be enlightened on<br>all these points,&#8212;How the Kumara[61] was born, how he came to be known<br>as the son of Agni (the fire-god) and how he was begotten by Rudra or<br>Ganga and Krittika. O noble scion of Bhrigu's race, I desire to learn all<br>this accurately as it happened. O great muni, I am filled with great<br>curiosity.' Markandeya replied, 'In this connection this old story is<br>cited by the learned, as to how the carrier of oblations (the fire-god)<br>in a fit of rage, sought the waters of the sea in order to perform a<br>penance, and how the adorable Angiras transforming himself into the<br>fire-god,[62] destroyed darkness and distressed the world with his<br>scorching rays. In olden times, O long-armed hero, the great Angiras<br>performed a wonderful penance in his hermitage; he even excelled the<br>fire-god, the carrier of oblations, in splendour and in that state he<br>illumined the whole universe. At that time the fire-god was also<br>performing a penance and was greatly distressed by his (Angirasa's)<br>effulgence. He was greatly depressed, but did not know what to do. Then<br>that adorable god thought within himself, 'Brahma has created another<br>fire-god for this universe. As I have been practising austerities, my<br>services as the presiding deity of fire have been dispensed with; and<br>then he considered how he could re-establish himself as the god of fire.<br>He beheld the great muni giving heat to the whole universe like fire, and<br>approached him slowly with fear. But Angiras said to him, 'Do thou<br>quickly re-establish yourself as the fire animating the universe, thou<br>art well-known in the three stable worlds and thou wast first created by<br>Brahma to dispel darkness. Do thou, O destroyer of darkness, quickly<br>occupy thine own proper place.' Agni replied, 'My reputation has been<br>injured now in this world. And thou art become the fire-god, and people<br>will know thee, and not me, as fire. I have relinquished my god-hood of<br>fire, do thou become the primeval fire and I shall officiate as the<br>second or Prajapatyaka fire.' Angiras replied, 'Do thou become the<br>fire-god and the destroyer of darkness and do thou attend to thy sacred<br>duty of clearing people's way to heaven, and do thou, O lord, make me<br>speedily thy first child.' Markandeya continued, 'Hearing these words of<br>Angiras, the fire-god did as desired, and, O king, Angiras had a son<br>named Vrihaspati. Knowing him to be the first son of Angiras by Agni, the<br>gods, O Bharata, came and enquired about the mystery. And thus asked by<br>the gods he then enlightened them, and the gods then accepted the<br>explanation of Angiras. In this connection, I shall describe to thee<br>religious sorts of fire of great effulgence which are here variously<br>known in the Brahmanas[63] by their respective uses."
