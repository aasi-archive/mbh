                            "Rama said, 'The blame is mine, O father, that like a stag in the wood,<br>thou hast been shot dead with arrows, by those mean and stupid<br>wretches&#8212;the sons of Kartavirya. And O father, virtuous and unswerving<br>from the path of righteousness and inoffensive to all animated beings as<br>thou wert, how came it to be permitted by Fate that thou shouldst die in<br>this way? What an awful sin must have been committed by them, who have<br>killed thee with hundreds of sharpened shafts, although thou wert an aged<br>man, and engaged in penances at the time and absolutely averse to<br>fighting with them. With what face will those shameless persons speak of<br>this deed of theirs to their friends and servants, viz., that they have<br>slain an unassisted and unresisting virtuous man?&#8212;O protector of men,<br>thus he, great in penance, bewailed much in a piteous manner, and then<br>performed the obsequies of his departed sire. And Rama, the conqueror of<br>hostile cities, cremated his father on the funeral pyre, and vowed, O<br>scion of Bharata's race, the slaughter of the entire military caste, and<br>of exceeding strength in the field of battle, and possessed of valour<br>suited to a heroic soul, and comparable to the god of death himself, he<br>took up his weapon in wrathful mood, and singlehanded put Kartavirya's<br>sons to death. And, O chieftain of the military caste, Rama, the leader<br>of all capable of beating their foes, thrice smote down all the<br>Kashatriya followers of Kartavirya's sons. And seven times did that<br>powerful lord exterminate the military tribes of the earth. In the tract<br>of land, called Samantapanchaka five lakes of blood were made by him.<br>There the mightiest scion of Bhrigu's race offered libations to his<br>forefathers&#8212;the Bhrigus, and Richika appeared to him in a visible form,<br>and spake to him words of counsel. Then the son of Jamadagni of dreaded<br>name, performed a mighty sacrifice and gratified the lord of the<br>celestials, and bestowed the earth to the ministering priests. And, O<br>protector of human beings, he raised an altar made of gold, ten Vyamas in<br>breadth and nine in height, and made a gift of the same to the<br>magnanimous Kasyapa. Then at Kasyapa's bidding the Brahamanas divided the<br>altar into a number of shares, and thus they became reputed as the<br>Khandavayamas (share takers). And the exterminator of the military race<br>possessed of immense strength, bestowed the earth upon the high-souled<br>Kasyapa, and then became engaged in penance of an exceedingly severe<br>form. He now dwells in this Mahendra, monarch of hills. Thus did<br>hostilities arise between him and the members of the military caste,&#8212;all<br>of them who dwell on this earth; and Rama, endowed with immense strength,<br>in this way subdued the entire world.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then on the fourteenth day of the moon, the<br>mighty-souled Rama at the proper hour showed himself to those members of<br>the priestly caste and also to the virtuous king (Yudhishthira) and his<br>younger brothers. And, O king of kings, the lord together with his<br>brothers, worshipped Rama, and, O most righteous of the rulers of men,<br>the very highest honours were paid by him to all those members of the<br>twice-born class. And after worshipping Jamadagni's son and having<br>received words of praise from him, at his direction he spent the night on<br>the Mahendra hill, and then started on his journey towards the southern<br>regions.'"
