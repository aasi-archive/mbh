                            "Markandeya said, 'Having pondered over these words (of Narada) about his<br>daughter's marriage, the king began to make arrangements about the<br>nuptials. And summoning all the old Brahmanas, and Ritwijas together with<br>the priests, he set out with his daughter on an auspicious day. And<br>arriving at the asylum of Dyumatsena in the sacred forest, the king<br>approached the royal sage on foot, accompanied by the twice-born ones.<br>And there he beheld the blind monarch of great wisdom seated on a cushion<br>of Kusa grass spread under Sala tree. And after duly reverencing the<br>royal sage, the king in an humble speech introduced himself. Thereupon,<br>offering him the Arghya, a seat, and a cow, the monarch asked his royal<br>guest,&#8212;Wherefore is this visit?&#8212;Thus addressed the king disclosed<br>everything about his intentions and purpose with reference to Satyavan.<br>And Aswapati said, 'O royal sage, this beautiful girl is my daughter<br>named Savitri. O thou versed in morality, do thou, agreeably to the<br>customs of our order, take her from me as thy daughter-in-law!' Hearing<br>these words, Dyumatsena said, 'Deprived of kingdom, and taking up our<br>abode in the woods, we are engaged in the practice of virtue as ascetics<br>with regulated lives. Unworthy of a forest life, how will thy daughter,<br>living in the sylvan asylum, bear this hardship?' Aswapati said, 'When my<br>daughter knoweth, as well as myself, that happiness and misery come and<br>go (without either being stationary), such words as these are not fit to<br>be used towards one like me! O king, I have come hither, having made up<br>my mind! I have bowed to thee from friendship; it behoveth thee not,<br>therefore, to destroy my hope! It behoveth thee not, also, to disregard<br>me who, moved by love, have come to thee! Thou art my equal and fit for<br>an alliance with me, as indeed, I am thy equal and fit for alliance with<br>thee! Do thou, therefore, accept my daughter for thy daughter-in-law and<br>the wife of the good Satyavan!' Hearing these words Dyumatsena said,<br>'Formerly I had desired an alliance with thee. But I hesitated, being<br>subsequently deprived of my kingdom. Let this wish, therefore, that I had<br>formerly entertained, be accomplished this very day. Thou art, indeed, a<br>welcome guest to me!'<br><br>"Then summoning all the twice-born ones residing in the hermitages of<br>that forest, the two kings caused the union to take place with due rites.<br>And having bestowed his daughter with suitable robes and ornaments,<br>Aswapati went back to his abode in great joy. And Satyavan, having<br>obtained a wife possessed of every accomplishment, became highly glad,<br>while she also rejoiced exceedingly upon having gained the husband after<br>her own heart. And when her father had departed, she put off all her<br>ornaments, and clad herself in barks and cloths dyed in red. And by her<br>services and virtues, her tenderness and self-denial, and by her<br>agreeable offices unto all, she pleased everybody. And she gratified her<br>mother-in-law by attending to her person and by covering her with robes<br>and ornaments. And she gratified her father-in-law by worshipping him as<br>a god and controlling her speech. And she pleased her husband by her<br>honeyed speeches, her skill in every kind of work, the evenness of her<br>temper, and by the indications of her love in private. And thus, O<br>Bharata, living in the asylum of those pious dwellers of the forest, they<br>continued for some time to practise ascetic austerities. But the words<br>spoken by Narada were present night and day in the mind of the sorrowful<br>Savitri.'"
