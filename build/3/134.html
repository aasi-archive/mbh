                            "Ashtavakra said, 'O king, O leader of fierce legions, in this assembly<br>of monarchs of unrivalled power who have met together, I am unable to<br>find out Vandin, chief of the controversialists. But I am searching for<br>him, even as one doth for a swan on a vast expanse of water. O Vandin,<br>thou regardest thyself as the foremost of controversialists. When though<br>wilt engage with me in staking, thou wilt not be able to flow like the<br>current of a river. I am like a full-flaming fire. Be silent before me, O<br>Vandin! Do not awaken a sleeping tiger. Know that thou shalt not escape<br>unstung, after trampling on the head of a venomous snake, licking the<br>corners of its mouth with its tongue, and who hath been hurt by thy foot.<br>That weak man who, in pride of strength, attempts to strike a blow at a<br>mountain, only gets his hands and nails hurt, but no wound is left on the<br>mountain itself. As the other mountains are inferior to the Mainaka, and<br>as calves are inferior to the ox, so are all other kings of the earth<br>inferior to the lord of Mithila. And as Indra is the foremost of<br>celestials, and as the Ganga is the best of rivers, so thou alone art, O<br>king, the greatest of monarchs. O king, cause Vandin to be brought to my<br>presence.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'Saying this, O Yudhishthira, wroth with Vandin, Ashtavakra<br>thus thundered in the assembly, and addressed him in these words, 'Do<br>thou answer my questions, and I shall answer thine.' Thereat Vandin said,<br>'One only fire blazeth forth in various shapes; one only sun illumineth<br>this whole world; one only hero, Indra, the lord of celestials,<br>destroyeth enemies; and one only Yama is the sole lord of the Pitris.[26]<br>Ashtavakra said, 'The two friends, Indra and Agni, ever move together;<br>the two celestial sages are Narada and Parvata; twins are the<br>Aswinikumaras; two is the number of the wheels of a car; and it is as a<br>couple that husband and wife live together, as ordained by the<br>deity.'[27] Vandin said, 'Three kinds of born beings are produced by<br>acts; the three Vedas together perform the sacrifice, Vajapeya; at three<br>different times, the Adhwaryus commence sacrificial rites; three is the<br>number of words: and three also are the divine lights.'[28] Ashtavakra<br>said, 'Four are the Asramas of the Brahmanas; the four orders perform<br>sacrifices; four are the cardinal points; four is the number of letters;<br>and four also, as is ever known, are the legs of a cow.'[29] Vandin said,<br>'Five is the number of fires; five are the feet of the metre called<br>Punki; five are the sacrifices; five locks, it is said in the Vedas, are<br>on the heads of the Apsaras; and five sacred rivers are known in the<br>world.'[30] Ashtavakra said. 'Six cows, it is asserted by some, and paid<br>as a gratuity on the occasion of establishing the sacred fire; six are<br>the seasons belonging to the wheel of time; six is the number of the<br>senses; six stars constitute the constellation Kirtika; and six, it is<br>found in all the Vedas, is the number of the Sadyaska sacrifice.'[31]<br>Vandin said, 'Seven is the number of the domesticated animals; seven are<br>the wild animals; seven metres are used in completing a sacrifice; seven<br>are the Rishis, seven forms of paying homage are extant (in the world);<br>and seven, it is known, are the strings of the Vina.'[32] Ashtavakra<br>said, 'Eight are the bags containing a hundred fold; eight is the number<br>of the legs of the Sarabha, which preyeth upon lions; eight Vasus, as we<br>hear, are amongst the celestials; and eight are the angles of yupa<br>(stake), in all sacrificial rites.'[33] Vandin said, 'Nine is the number<br>of the mantras used in kindling the fire in sacrifices to the Pitris;<br>nine are the appointed functions in the processes of creation; nine<br>letters compose the foot of the metre, Vrihati; and nine also is ever the<br>number of the figures (in calculation).'[34] Ashtavakra said, 'Ten is<br>said to be the number of cardinal points, entering into the cognition of<br>men in this world; ten times hundred make up a thousand; ten is the<br>number of months, during which women bear; and ten are the teachers of<br>true knowledge, and ten, the haters thereof, and ten again are those<br>capable of learning it.'[35] Vandin said, 'Eleven are the objects<br>enjoyable by beings; eleven is the number of the yupas; eleven are the<br>changes of the natural state pertaining to those having life; and eleven<br>are the Rudras among the gods in heaven.'[36] Ashtavakra said, Twelve<br>months compose the year; twelve letters go to the composition of a foot<br>of the metre called Jagati; twelve are the minor sacrifices; and twelve,<br>according to the learned, is the number of the Adityas.'[37] Vandin said,<br>'The thirteenth lunar day is considered the most auspicious; thirteen<br>islands exist on earth.[38]<br><br>Lomasa said, 'Having proceeded thus far, Vandin stopped. Thereupon<br>Ashtavakra supplied the latter half of the sloka. Ashtavakra said,<br>'Thirteen sacrifices are presided over by Kesi; and thirteen are devoured<br>by Atichhandas, (the longer metres) of the Veda.[39] And seeing<br>Ashtavakra speaking and the Suta's son silent, and pensive, and with head<br>downcast, the assembly broke into a long uproar. And when the tumult thus<br>arose in the splendid sacrifice performed by king Janaka, the Brahmanas<br>well pleased, and with joined hands, approached Ashtavakra, and began to<br>pay him homage.'<br><br>"Thereupon Ashtavakra said, 'Before this, this man, defeating the<br>Brahmanas in controversy, used to cast them into water. Let Vandin today<br>meet with the same fate. Seize him and drown him in water.' Vandin said.<br>'O Janaka, I am the son of king Varuna. Simultaneously with thy<br>sacrifice, there also hath commenced a sacrifice extending over twelve<br>years. It is for this that I have despatched the principal Brahmanas<br>thither. They have gone to witness Varuna's sacrifice. Lo! there they are<br>returning. I pay homage to the worshipful Ashtavakra, by whose grace<br>to-day I shall join him who hath begot me.'<br><br>"Ashtavakra said, 'Defeating the Brahmanas either by words or subtlety.<br>Vandin had cast them into the waters of the sea. (That Vedic truth which<br>he had suppressed by false arguments), have I to-day rescued by dint of<br>my intellect. Now let candid men judge. As Agni, who knoweth the<br>character of both the good and the bad, leaveth unscorched by his heat<br>the bodies of those whose designs are honest, and is thus partial to<br>them, so good men judge the assertions of boys, although lacking the<br>power of speech, and are favourably disposed towards them. O Janaka, thou<br>hearest my words as if thou hast been stupefied in consequence of having<br>eaten the fruit of the Sleshmataki tree. Or flattery hath robbed thee of<br>thy sense, and for this it is that although pierced by my words as an<br>elephant (by the hook), thou hearest them not.'<br><br>"Janaka said, 'Listening to thy words, I take them to be excellent and<br>superhuman. Thy form also standeth manifest as superhuman. As thou hast<br>to-day defeated Vandin in discussion, I place even him at thy disposal.'<br>Ashtavakra said, 'O king, Vandin remaining alive, will not serve any<br>purpose of mine. If his father be really Varuna, let him be drowned in<br>the sea.'<br><br>Vandin said, 'I am King Varuna's son. I have no fear (therefore) in being<br>drowned. Even at this moment. Ashtavakra shall see his long-lost sire,<br>Kahoda.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'Then rose before Janaka all the Brahmanas, after having<br>been duly worshipped by the magnanimous Varuna. Kahoda said, 'It is for<br>this, O Janaka, that men pray for sons, by performing meritorious acts.<br>That in which I had failed hath been achieved by my son. Weak persons may<br>have sons endued with strength; dunces may have intelligent sons; and the<br>illiterate may have sons possessed of learning.' Vandin said, 'It is with<br>thy sharpened axe, O monarch, that even Yama severeth the heads of foes.<br>May prosperity attend thee! In this sacrifice of king Janaka, the<br>principal hymns relating to the Uktha rites are being chanted, and the<br>Soma juice also is being adequately quaffed. And the gods themselves, in<br>person, and with cheerful hearts, are accepting their sacred shares.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'When in enhanced splendour, the Brahmanas had risen up,<br>Vandin, taking king Janaka's permission, entered into the waters of the<br>sea. And then Ashtavakra worshipped his father, and he himself also was<br>worshipped by the Brahmanas. And having thus defeated the Suta's son.[40]<br>Ashtavakra returned to his own excellent hermitage, in company with his<br>uncle. Then in the presence of his mother, his father addressed him,<br>saying, '(O son), thou speedily enter into this river, Samanga.' And<br>accordingly, he entered (into the water). (And as he plunged beneath the<br>water), all his (crooked) limbs were immediately made straight. And from<br>that day that river came to be called Samanga and she became invested<br>with the virtues of purifying (sins). He that shall bathe in her, will be<br>freed from his sins. Therefore, O Yudhishthira, do thou with thy brothers<br>and wife descend to the river, and perform thy ablutions. O Kunti's son,<br>O scion of the Ajamidha race, living happily and cheerfully at this place<br>together with thy brothers and the Brahmanas, thou wilt perform with me<br>other acts of merit, being intent upon good deeds.'"
