                            Vaisampayana said, "Then that mighty bowman of blazing splendour, Arjuna,<br>smilingly said unto Chitrasena in the midst of the Gandharva host, 'What<br>purpose dost thou serve, O hero, in punishing the Kauravas? O, why also<br>hath Suyodhana with his wives been thus punished?'<br><br>"Chitrasena replied, 'O Dhananjaya, without stirring from my own abode I<br>became acquainted with the purpose of the wicked Duryodhana and the<br>wretched Karna in coming hither. The purpose was even this,&#8212;knowing that<br>ye are exiles in the forest and suffering great afflictions as if ye had<br>none to take care of you, himself in prosperity, this wretch entertained<br>the desire of beholding you plunged in adversity and misfortune. They<br>came hither for mocking you and the illustrious daughter of Drupada. The<br>lord of the celestials also, having ascertained this purpose of theirs,<br>told me, 'Go thou and bring Duryodhana hither in chains along with his<br>counsellors. Dhananjaya also with his brother should always be protected<br>by thee in battle, for he is thy dear friend and disciple.' At these<br>words of the lord of the celestials I came hither speedily. This wicked<br>prince hath also been put in chains. I will now proceed to the region of<br>the celestials, whither I will lead this wicked wight at the command of<br>the slayer of Paka!'<br><br>"Arjuna answered, saying, 'O Chitrasena, if thou wishest to do what is<br>agreeable to me, set Suyodhana free, at the command of king Yudhishthira<br>the just, for he is our brother!'<br><br>Chitrasena said, "This sinful wretch is always full of vanity. He<br>deserveth not to be set free. O Dhananjaya, he hath deceived and wronged<br>both king Yudhishthira the just and Krishna. Yudhishthira the son of<br>Kunti as yet knoweth not the purpose on which the wretch came hither. Let<br>the king, therefore, do what he desires after knowing everything!"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "After this, all of them went to king<br>Yudhishthira the just. And going unto the king, they represented unto him<br>everything about Duryodhana's conduct. And Ajatasatru, hearing everything<br>that the Gandharvas had said, liberated all the Kauravas and applauded<br>the Gandharvas. And the king said, 'Fortunate it is for us that though<br>gifted with great strength, ye did not yet slay the wicked son of<br>Dhritarashtra along with all counsellors and relatives. This, O sir, hath<br>been an act of great kindness done to me by the Gandharvas. The honour<br>also of my family is saved by liberating this wicked wight. I am glad at<br>seeing you all. Command me what I am to do for you. And having obtained<br>all you wish, return ye soon whence ye came!'<br><br>"Thus addressed by the intelligent son of Pandu, the Gandharvas became<br>well-pleased and went away with the Apsaras. And the lord of the<br>celestials then, coming to that spot, revived those Gandharvas that had<br>been slain in the encounter with the Kurus, by sprinkling the celestial<br>Amrita over them. And the Pandavas also, having liberated their relatives<br>along with the ladies of the royal household, and having achieved that<br>difficult feat (the defeat of the Gandharvas host) became well-pleased.<br>And those illustrious and mighty warriors worshipped by the Kurus along<br>with their sons and wives, blazed forth in splendour like flaming fires<br>in the sacrificial compound. And Yudhishthira then addressing the<br>liberated Duryodhana in the midst of his brothers, from affection, told<br>him these words: 'O child, never again do such a rash act. O Bharata, a<br>rash wight never cometh by happiness. O son of the Kuru race, pleased be<br>thou with all thy brothers. Go back to thy capital as pleaseth thee,<br>without yielding thyself to despondency or cheerlessness!"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus dismissed by the son of Pandu, king<br>Duryodhana then saluted king Yudhishthira the just and overwhelmed with<br>shame, and his heart rent in twain, mechanically set out for his capital,<br>like one destitute of life. And after the Kaurava prince had departed,<br>the brave Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, along with his brothers, was<br>worshipped by the Brahmanas, and surrounded by those Brahmanas endued<br>with the wealth of asceticism, like Sakra himself by the celestials, he<br>began to pass his days happily in the woods of Dwaita."
