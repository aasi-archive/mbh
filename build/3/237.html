                            Vaisampayana said, "They then all saw king Dhritarashtra, O Janamejaya,<br>and having seen him, enquired after his welfare, and were, in return,<br>asked about their welfare. Then a cow-herd named Samanga, who had been<br>instructed beforehand by them, approaching the king, spoke unto him of<br>the cattle. Then the son of Radha and Sakuni, O king, addressing<br>Dhritarashtra, that foremost of monarchs, said, 'O Kaurava, our<br>cattle-stations are now in a delightful place. The time for their tale as<br>also for marking the calves hath come. And, O monarch, this also is an<br>excellent season for thy son to go ahunting! It behoveth thee, therefore,<br>to grant permission to Duryodhana to go thither.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra replied, 'The chase of the deer, as also the examination<br>of cattle is very proper, O child! I think, indeed, that the herdsmen are<br>not to be trusted. But we have heard that those tigers among men, the<br>Pandavas, are now staying in the vicinity of those cattle stations. I<br>think, therefore, ye should not go thither yourselves! Defeated by<br>deceitful means they are now living in the deep forest in great<br>suffering. O Radheya, they are mighty warriors and naturally able, they<br>are now devoted to ascetic austerities. King Yudhishthira will not suffer<br>his wrath to be awakened, but Bhimasena is naturally passionate. The<br>daughter of Yajnasena is energy's self. Full of pride and folly, ye are<br>certain to give offence. Endued with ascetic merit she will certainly<br>consume you, or perhaps, those heroes, armed with swords and weapons!<br>Nor, if from force of numbers, ye seek to injure them in any respect,<br>that will be a highly improper act, although, as I think, ye will never<br>be able to succeed. The mighty-armed Dhananjaya hath returned thence to<br>the forest. While unaccomplished in arms, Vivatsu had subjugated the<br>whole earth before. A mighty warrior as he is and accomplished in arms<br>now, will he not be able to slay you all? Or, if in obedience to my<br>words, ye behave carefully having repaired thither, ye will not be able<br>to live happily there in consequence of the anxiety ye will feel owing to<br>a state of continued trustlessness. Or, some soldier of yours may do some<br>injury to Yudhishthira, and that unpremeditated act will be ascribed to<br>your fault. Therefore, let some faithful men proceed there for the work<br>of tale. I do not think it is proper for thee, Bharata, to go thither<br>thyself."<br><br>"Sakuni said, 'The eldest of the sons of Pandu is cognisant of morality.<br>He pledged in the midst of the assembly, O Bharata, that he would live<br>for twelve years in the forest. The other sons of Pandu are all virtuous<br>and obedient to Yudhishthira. And Yudhishthira himself, the son of Kunti,<br>will never be angry with us. Indeed, we desire very much to go on a<br>hunting expedition, and will avail of that opportunity for supervising<br>the tale of our cattle. We have no mind to see the sons of Pandu. We will<br>not go to that spot where the Pandavas have taken up their residence, and<br>consequently no exhibition of misconduct can possibly arise on our part.'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed by Sakuni, that lord of men,<br>Dhritarashtra, granted permission, but not very willingly, to Duryodhana<br>and his counsellors to go to the place. And permitted by the monarch the<br>Bharata prince born of Gandhari started, accompanied by Karna and<br>surrounded by a large host. And he was also accompanied by Dussasana and<br>Suvala's son of great intelligence and by many other brothers of his and<br>by ladies in thousands. And as the mighty-armed prince started for<br>beholding the lake that was known by the name of Dwaitavana, the citizens<br>(of Hastina), also accompanied by their wives began to follow him to that<br>forest. Eight thousand cars, thirty thousand elephants, nine thousand<br>horses, and many thousands of foot-soldiers, and shops and pavilions and<br>traders, bards and men trained in the chase by hundreds and thousands<br>followed the prince. And as the king started, followed by this large<br>concourse of people, the uproar that was caused there resembled, O king,<br>the deep tumult of the ranging winds in the rainy season. And reaching<br>the lake Dwaitavana with all his followers and vehicles, king Duryodhana<br>took up his quarters at the distance of four miles from it."
