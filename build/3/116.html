                            "Akritavrana said, 'Jamadagni devoted himself to the study of the Veda<br>and the practice of sacred penances, and became famous for his great<br>austerities. Then he pursued a methodical course of study and obtained a<br>mastery over the entire Veda. And, O king, he paid a visit to Prasenajit<br>and solicited the hand of Renuka in marriage. And this prayer was granted<br>by the king. And the delight of Bhrigu's race having thus obtained Renuka<br>for his wife, took his residence with her in a hermitage, and began to<br>practice penances, being assisted by her. And four boys were born of her,<br>with Rama for the fifth. And although the youngest, Rama was superior to<br>all in merit. Now once upon a time, when her sons had gone out for the<br>purpose of gathering fruits, Renuka who had a pure and austere life, went<br>out to bathe. And, O king, while returning home, she happened to cast her<br>glance towards the king of Martikavata, known by the name of Chitraratha.<br>The king was in the water with his wives, and wearing on his breast a<br>lotus wreath, was engaged in sport. And beholding his magnificent form,<br>Renuka was inspired with desire. And this unlawful desire she could not<br>control, but became polluted within the water, and came back to the<br>hermitage frightened at heart. Her husband readily perceived what state<br>she was in. And mighty and powerful and of a wrathful turn of mind, when<br>he beheld that she had been giddy and that the lustre of chastity had<br>abandoned her, he reproached her by crying out 'Fie!' At that very moment<br>came in the eldest of Jamadagni's sons, Rumanvan; and then, Sushena, and<br>then, Vasu, and likewise, Viswavasu. And the mighty saint directed them<br>all one by one to put an end to the life of their mother. They, however,<br>were quite confounded and lost heart. And they could not utter a single<br>word. Then he in ire cursed them. And on being cursed they lost their<br>sense and suddenly became like inanimate objects, and comparable in<br>conduct to beasts and birds. And then Rama, the slayer of hostile heroes,<br>came to the hermitage, last of all. Him the mighty-armed Jamadagni, of<br>great austerities, addressed, saying, 'Kill this wicked mother of thine,<br>without compunction, O my son.' Thereupon Rama immediately took up an axe<br>and therewith severed his mother's head. Then, O great king, the wrath of<br>Jamadagni of mighty soul, was at once appeased; and well-pleased, he<br>spake the following words, 'Thou hast, my boy, performed at my bidding<br>this difficult task, being versed in virtue. Therefore, whatsoever wishes<br>there may be in thy heart, I am ready to grant them all. Do thou ask me.'<br>Thereupon Rama solicited that his mother might be restored to life, and<br>that he might not be haunted by the remembrance of this cruel deed and<br>that he might not be affected by any sin, and that his brothers might<br>recover their former state, and that he might be unrivalled on the field<br>of battle, and that he might obtain long life. And, O Bharata's son,<br>Jamadagni, whose penances were the most rigid, granted all those desires<br>of his son. Once, however, O lord, when his sons had gone out as before,<br>the valourous son of Kartavirya, the lord of the country near the shore<br>of the sea, came up to the hermitage. And when he arrived at that<br>hermitage, the wife of the saint received him hospitably. He, however,<br>intoxicated with a warrior's pride, was not at all pleased with the<br>reception accorded to him, and by force and in defiance of all<br>resistance, seized and carried off from that hermitage the chief of the<br>cows whose milk supplied the sacred butter, not heeding the loud lowing<br>of the cow. And he wantonly pulled down the large trees of the wood. When<br>Rama came home, his father himself told him all that had happened. Then<br>when Rama saw how the cow was lowing for its calf, resentment arose in<br>his heart. And he rushed towards Kartavirya's son, whose last moments had<br>drawn nigh. Then the descendant of Bhrigu, the exterminator of hostile<br>heroes, put forth his valour on the field of battle, and with sharpened<br>arrows with flattened tips, which were shot from a beautiful bow, cut<br>down Arjuna's arms, which numbered a thousand, and were massive like<br>(wooden) bolts for barring the door. He, already touched by the hand of<br>death, was overpowered by Rama, his foe. Then the kinsmen of Arjuna,<br>their wrath excited against Rama, rushed at Jamadagni in his hermitage,<br>while Rama was away. And they slew him there; for although his strength<br>was great, yet being at the time engaged in penances, he would not fight.<br>And while thus attacked by his foes, he repeatedly shouted the name of<br>Rama in a helpless and piteous way. And, O Yudhishthira, the sons of<br>Kartavirya shot Jamadagni, with their arrows, and having thus chastised<br>their foe, went their way. And when they had gone away, and when<br>Jamadagni had breathed his last, Rama, the delight of Bhrigu's race,<br>returned to the hermitage, bearing in his arms, fuel for religious rites.<br>And the hero beheld his father who had been put to death. And grieved<br>exceedingly he began to bewail the unworthy fate that had laid his father<br>low."
