                            "Vrihadaswa said, 'Hearing everything, Damayanti became oppressed with<br>grief, and suspecting the person to be Nala, said unto Kesini, 'O Kesini,<br>go thou again, and examine Vahuka, and staying in silence at his side<br>mark thou his conduct. And, O beauteous one, whenever he happens to do<br>anything skilful, do thou observe well his act while accomplishing it.<br>And, O Kesini, whenever he may ask water or fire, with the view of<br>offering him obstruction, thou shalt be in no hurry to give it. And<br>marking everything about his behaviour, come thou and tell me. And<br>whatever human or super-human thou seest in Vahuka, together with<br>anything else, should all be reported unto me.' And thus addressed by<br>Damayanti, Kesini went away, and having marked the conduct of that person<br>versed in horse-lore, she came back. And she related unto Damayanti all<br>that had happened, indeed, everything of human and superhuman that she<br>had witnessed in Vahuka. And Kesini said, 'O Damayanti, a person of such<br>control over the elements I have never before seen or heard of. Whenever<br>he cometh to low passage, he never stoopeth down, but seeing him, the<br>passage itself groweth in height so that he may pass through it easily.<br>And at his approach, impassable narrow holes open wide. King Bhima had<br>sent various kinds of meat&#8212;of diverse animals, for Rituparna's food. And<br>many vessels had been placed there for washing the meat. And as he looked<br>upon them, those vessels became filled (with water). And having washed<br>the meat, as he set himself to cook, he took up a handful of grass and<br>held it in the sun, when fire blazed up all on a sudden. Beholding this<br>marvel, I have come hither amazed. Further, I have witnessed in him<br>another great wonder. O beauteous one, he touched fire and was not burnt.<br>And at his will, water falling floweth in a stream. And, I have witnessed<br>another greater wonder still. He took up some flowers, began to press<br>them slowly with his hands. And pressed by his hand, the flowers did not<br>lose their original forms, but, on the contrary, became gayer and more<br>odorous than before. Having beheld wonderful things I have come hither<br>with speed.'"<br><br>"Vrihadaswa continued, 'Hearing of these acts of the virtuous Nala, and<br>discovering him from his behaviour, Damayanti considered him as already<br>recovered. And from these indications suspecting that Vahuka was her<br>husband, Damayanti once more weepingly addressed Kesini in soft words,<br>saying, 'O beauteous one, go thou once more, and bring from the kitchen<br>without Vahuka's knowledge some meat that hath been boiled and dressed<br>(by him).' Thus commanded, Kesini, ever bent on doing what was agreeable<br>to Damayanti, went to Vahuka, and taking some hot meat came back without<br>loss of time. And Kesini gave that meat, O son of the Kuru race, unto<br>Damayanti. And Damayanti who had formerly often partaken of meat dressed<br>by Nala, tasted the meat that was brought by her hand-maid. And she<br>thereupon decided Vahuka to be Nala and wept aloud in grief of heart.<br>And, O Bharata, overwhelmed with grief, and washing her face, she sent<br>her two children with Kesini. And Vahuka, who was the king in disguise,<br>recognising Indrasena with her brother, advanced hastily, and embracing<br>them, took them up on his lap. And taking up his children like unto the<br>children of the celestials, he began to weep aloud in sonorous accents,<br>his heart oppressed with great sorrow. And after having repeatedly<br>betrayed his agitation, Naishadha suddenly left children, and addressed<br>Kesini, saying, 'O fair damsel, these twins are very like my own<br>children. Beholding them unexpectedly, I shed tears. If thou comest to me<br>frequently people may think evil, for we are guests from another land.<br>Therefore. O blessed one, go at thy ease.'"
