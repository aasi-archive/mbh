                            Vaisampayana said, "Although that noble girl addressed him in various<br>sweet words, yet she was unable to dissuade that deity of a thousand<br>rays. And when she failed to dissuade the dispeller of darkness, at last<br>from fear of a curse, she reflected, O king, for a long time!&#8212;'How may<br>my innocent father, and that Brahmana also, escape the angry Surya's<br>curse for my sake? Although energy and asceticism are capable of<br>destroying sins, yet even honest persons, if they be of unripe age,<br>should not foolishly court them. By foolishly acting in that way I have<br>today been placed in a frightful situation. Indeed, I have been placed<br>entirely within the grasp of this deity. Ye how can I do what is sinful<br>by taking it on myself to surrender my person to him?'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, afflicted with fear of a curse, and thinking much<br>within herself, an utter stupefaction of the senses came upon her. And<br>she was so confounded that she could not settle what to do. Afraid, on<br>the one hand, O king, of the reproach of friends if she obeyed the deity,<br>and, on the other, of his curse if she disobeyed him, the damsel at last,<br>O foremost of kings, said these words unto that god, in accents tremulous<br>with bashfulness, 'O god, as my father and mother and friends are still<br>living, this violation of duty on my part should not take place. If; O<br>god, I commit this unlawful act with thee, the reputation of this race<br>shall be sacrificed in this world on my account. If thou, however, O thou<br>foremost of those that impart heat, deem this to be a meritorious act, I<br>shall then fulfil thy desire even though my relatives may not have<br>bestowed me on thee! May I remain chaste after having surrendered my<br>person to thee! Surely, the virtue, the reputation, the fame, and the<br>life of every creature are established in thee!' Hearing these words of<br>hers, Surya replied, 'O thou of sweet smiles, neither thy father, nor thy<br>mother, nor any other superior of thine, is competent to give thee away!<br>May good betide thee, O beauteous damsel! Do thou listen to my words! It<br>is because a virgin desireth the company of every one, that she hath<br>received the appellation of Kanya, from the root kama meaning to desire.<br>Therefore, O thou of excellent hips and the fairest complexion, a virgin<br>is, by nature, free in this world. Thou shalt not, O lady, by any means,<br>be guilty of any sin by complying with my request. And how can I, who am<br>desirous of the welfare of all creatures, commit an unrighteous act? That<br>all men and women should be bound by no restraints, is the law of nature.<br>The opposite condition is the perversion of the natural state. Thou shalt<br>remain a virgin after having gratified me. And thy son shall also be<br>mighty-armed and illustrious.' Thereupon Kunti said, 'If, O dispeller of<br>darkness, I obtain a son from thee, may he be furnished with a coat of<br>mail and ear-rings, and may he be mighty-armed and endued with great<br>strength!' Hearing these words of hers, Surya answered, 'O gentle maiden,<br>thy son shall be mighty-armed and decked with ear-rings and a celestial<br>coat of mail. And both his ear-rings and coat of mail will be made of<br>Amrita, and his coat will also be invulnerable.' Kunti then said, 'If the<br>excellent mail and ear-rings of the son thou wilt beget on me, be,<br>indeed, made of Amrita, then, O god, O worshipful deity, let thy purpose<br>be fulfilled! May he be powerful, strong, energetic, and handsome, even<br>like thee, and may he also be endued with virtue!' Surya then said, 'O<br>princess, O excellent damsel, these ear-rings had been given to me by<br>Aditi. O timid lady, I will bestow them, as also this excellent mail, on<br>thy son!' Kunti then said, 'Very well, O worshipful one! If my son, O<br>lord of light, become so, I will, as thou sayest, gratify thee!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Hearing these words of hers Surya said, 'So be<br>it!' And that ranger of the skies, that enemy of Swarbhanu, with soul<br>absorbed in Yoga, entered into Kunti, and touched her on the navel. At<br>this, that damsel, on account of Surya's energy, became stupefied. And<br>that reverend lady then fell down on her bed, deprived of her senses.<br>Surya then addressed her, saying, 'I will now depart, O thou of graceful<br>hips! Thou shalt bring forth a son who will become the foremost of all<br>wielders of weapons. At the same time thou shalt remain a virgin.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Then, O foremost of kings, as the highly<br>effulgent Surya was about to depart, that girl bashfully said unto him,<br>'So be it!' And it was thus that the daughter of king Kuntibhoja,<br>importuned by Surya, had after soliciting a son from him, fallen down<br>stupefied on that excellent bed, like a broken creeper. And it was thus<br>that deity of fierce rays, stupefying her, entered into her by virtue of<br>Yoga power, and placed his own self within her womb. The deity, however,<br>did not sully her by deflowering her in the flesh. And after Surya had<br>gone away, that girl regained her consciousness."
