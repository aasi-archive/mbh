                            "Markandeya continued, 'The pious fowler, O Yudhishthira, then said to<br>that Brahmana, 'Undoubtedly my deeds are very cruel, but, O Brahmana,<br>Destiny is all-powerful and it is difficult to evade the consequence of<br>our past actions. And this is the karmic evil arising out of sin<br>committed in a former life. But, O Brahmana, I am always assiduous in<br>eradicating the evil. The Deity takes away life, the executioner acts<br>only as a secondary agent. And we, O good Brahmana, are only such agents<br>in regard to our karma. Those animals that are slain by me and whose meat<br>I sell, also acquire karma, because (with their meat), gods and guests<br>and servants are regaled with dainty food and the manes are propitiated.<br>It is said authoritatively that herbs and vegetables, deer, birds and<br>wild animals constitute the food of all creatures. And, O Brahmana, king<br>Sivi, the son of Usinara, of great forbearance attained to heaven, which<br>is hard to reach, giving away his own flesh. And in days of yore, O<br>Brahmana, two thousand animals used to be killed every day in the kitchen<br>of king Rantideva; and in the same manner two thousand cows were killed<br>every day; and, O best of regenerate beings, king Rantideva acquired<br>unrivalled reputation by distributing food with meat every day. For the<br>performance of the fourmonthly rites animals ought to be sacrificed<br>daily. 'The sacred fire is fond of animal food,' this saying has come<br>down to us. And at sacrifices animals are invariably killed by regenerate<br>Brahmanas, and these animals being purged of sin, by incantation of<br>hymns, go to heaven. If, O Brahmana, the sacred fire had not been so fond<br>of animal food in ancient times, it could never have become the food of<br>any one. And in this matter of animal food, this rule has been laid down<br>by Munis:&#8212;Whoever partakes of animal food after having first offered it<br>duly and respectfully to the gods and the manes, is not polluted by the<br>act. And such a man is not at all considered to have partaken of animal<br>food, even, as a Brahmacharin having intercoursed with his wife during<br>the menstrual period, is nevertheless considered to be a good Brahmana.<br>After consideration of the propriety and impropriety of the matter, this<br>rule has been laid down. King Saudasa, O Brahmana, when under a curse,<br>often used to prey upon men; what is thy opinion of this matter? And, O<br>good Brahmana, knowing this to be the consequence of my own actions, I<br>obtain my livelihood from this profession. The forsaking of one's own<br>occupation is considered, O Brahmana, to be a sin, and the act of<br>sticking to one's own profession is without doubt a meritorious act. The<br>Karma of a former existence never forsakes any creature. And in<br>determining the various consequences of one's Karma, this rule was not<br>lost sight of by the Creator. A person having his being under the<br>influence of evil Karma, must always consider how he can atone for his<br>Karma, and extricate himself from an evil doom, and the evil Karma may be<br>expiated in various ways. Accordingly, O good Brahmana, I am charitable,<br>truthful, assiduous in attending on my superior, full of respect towards<br>regenerate Brahmanas, devoted to and free from pride and (idle) excessive<br>talk. Agriculture is considered to be a praiseworthy occupation, but it<br>is well-known that even there, great harm is done to animal life; and in<br>the operation of digging the earth with the plough, numberless creatures<br>lurking in the ground as also various other forms of animal life are<br>destroyed. Dost thou not think so? O good Brahmana, Vrihi and other seeds<br>of rice are all living organisms. What is thy opinion on this matter?<br>Men, O Brahmana, hunt wild animals and kill them and partake of their<br>meat; they also cut up trees and herbs; but, O Brahmana, there are<br>numberless living organisms in trees, in fruits, as also in water; dost<br>thou not think so? This whole creation, O Brahmana, is full of animal<br>life, sustaining itself with food derived from living organisms. Dost<br>thou not mark that fish preys upon fish, and that various species of<br>animals prey upon other species, and there are species the members of<br>which prey upon each other? Men, O Brahmana, while walking about hither<br>and thither, kill numberless creatures lurking in the ground by trampling<br>on them, and even men of wisdom and enlightenment destroy animal life in<br>various ways, even while sleeping or reposing themselves. What hast thou<br>to say to this?&#8212;The earth and the air all swarm with living organisms,<br>which are unconsciously destroyed by men from mere ignorance. Is not this<br>so? The commandment that people should not do harm to any creature, was<br>ordained of old by men, who were ignorant of the true facts of the case.<br>For, O Brahmana, there is not a man on the face of this earth, who is<br>free from the sin of doing injury to creatures. After full consideration,<br>the conclusion is irresistible that there is not a single man who is free<br>from the sin of doing injury to animal life. Even the sage, O good<br>Brahmana, whose vow is to do harm to no creature, doth inflict injury to<br>animal life. Only, on account of greater needfulness, the harm is less.<br>Men of noble birth and great qualities perpetrate wicked acts in defiance<br>of all, of which they are not at all ashamed. Good men acting in an<br>exemplary way are not commended by other good men; nor are bad men acting<br>in a contrary way praised by their wicked compeers; and friends are not<br>agreeable to friends, albeit endowed with high qualities; and foolish<br>pedantic men cry down the virtues of their preceptors. This reversal of<br>the natural order of things, O good Brahmana, is seen everywhere in this<br>world. What is thy opinion as to the virtuousness or otherwise of this<br>state of things? There is much that can be said of the goodness or<br>badness of our actions. But whoever is addicted to his own proper<br>occupation surely acquires great reputation.
