                            "Markandeya continued, 'Having exterminated the thieves and robbers,<br>Kalki will, at a great Horse-sacrifice, duly give away this earth to the<br>Brahmanas, and having established anew the blessed rectitude ordained by<br>the Self-create, Kalki, of sacred deeds and illustrious reputation, will<br>enter a delightful forest, and the people of this earth will imitate his<br>conduct, and when the Brahmanas will have exterminated the thieves and<br>robbers, there will be prosperity everywhere (on earth). And as the<br>countries of the earth will one after another be subjugated, that tiger<br>among Brahmanas, Kalki, having placed deer skins and lances and tridents<br>there, will roam over the earth, adored by foremost Brahmanas and showing<br>his regard for them and engaged all the while in slaughtering thieves and<br>robbers. And he will exterminate the thieves and robbers amid<br>heart-rending cries of 'Oh, father&#8212;' 'Oh, mother!&#8212;'O son!' and the<br>like, and O Bharata, when sin will thus have been rooted out and virtue<br>will flourish on arrival of the Krita age, men will once more betake<br>themselves to the practice of religious rites. And in the age that will<br>set in, viz., the Krita, well-planted gardens and sacrificial compounds<br>and large tanks and educational centres for the cultivation of Brahmanic<br>lore and ponds and temples will re-appear everywhere. And the ceremonies<br>and rites of sacrifices will also begin to be performed. And the<br>Brahmanas will become good and honest, and the regenerate ones, devoted<br>to ascetic austerities, will become Munis and the asylums of ascetics,<br>which had before been filled with wretches will once more be homes of men<br>devoted to truth, and men in general will begin to honour and practise<br>truth. And all seeds, sown on earth, will grow, and, O monarch, every<br>kind of crop will grow in every season. And men will devotedly practise<br>charity and vows and observances, and the Brahmanas devoted to meditation<br>and sacrifices will be of virtuous soul and always cheerful, and the<br>rulers of the earth will govern their kingdoms virtuously, and in the<br>Krita age, the Vaisyas will be devoted to the practices of their order.<br>And the Brahmanas will be devoted to their six-fold duties (of study,<br>teaching, performance of sacrifices on their own account, officiating at<br>sacrifices performed by others, charity and acceptance of gifts), and the<br>Kshatriyas will be devoted to feats of prowess. And Sudras will be<br>devoted to service of the three (high) orders,<br><br>"These, O Yudhishthira, are the courses of the Krita, the Treta, the<br>Dwapara and the succeeding age. I have now narrated to thee everything. I<br>have also told thee, O son of Pandu, the periods embraced by the several<br>Yugas as generally known. I have now told thee everything appertaining to<br>both the past and the future as narrated by Vayu in the Purana (which<br>goes by his name and) which is adored by the Rishis. Being immortal I<br>have many a time beheld and otherwise ascertained the courses of the<br>world. Indeed, all I have seen and felt I have now told thee. And, O thou<br>of unfading glory, listen now with thy brothers to something else I will<br>presently tell thee for clearing thy doubts about religion! O thou<br>foremost of virtuous men, thou shouldst always fix thy soul on virtue,<br>for, O monarch, a person of virtuous soul obtaineth bliss both here and<br>hereafter. And, O sinless one, listen to the auspicious words that I will<br>now speak to thee. Never do thou humiliate a Brahmana, for a Brahmana, if<br>angry, may by his vow destroy the three worlds."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Hearing these words of Markandeya, the royal<br>head of the Kurus, endued with intelligence and possessed of great<br>lustre, spoke these words of great wisdom, 'O muni, if I am to protect my<br>subjects, to what course of conduct should I adhere? And how should I<br>behave so that I may not fall away from the duties of my order?'<br><br>"Markandeya, hearing this, answered, 'Be merciful to all creatures, and<br>devoted to their good. Love all creatures, scorning none. Be truthful in<br>speech, humble, with passions under complete control, and always devoted<br>to the protection of thy people. Practise virtue and renounce sin, and<br>worship thou the manes and the god and whatever thou mayst have done from<br>ignorance or carelessness, wash them off and expiate them by charity.<br>Renouncing pride and vanity, be thou possessed to humility and good<br>behaviour. And subjugating the whole earth, rejoice thou and let<br>happiness be thine. This is the course of conduct that accords with<br>virtue. I have recited to thee all that was and all that will be regarded<br>as virtuous. There is nothing appertaining to the past or the future that<br>is unknown to thee. Therefore, O son, take not to heart this present<br>calamity of thine. They that are wise are never overwhelmed when they are<br>persecuted by Time. O thou of mighty arms, the very dwellers of heaven<br>cannot rise superior to Time. Time afflicts all creatures. O sinless one,<br>let not doubt cross thy mind regarding the truth of what I have told<br>thee, for, if thou sufferest doubt to enter thy heart, thy virtue will<br>suffer diminution! O bull of the Bharata race, thou art born in the<br>celebrated family of the Kurus. Thou shouldst practise that which I have<br>told thee, in thought, word and deed.'<br><br>Yudhishthira answered, "O thou foremost of the regenerate ones, at thy<br>command I will certainly act according to all the instructions thou hast<br>given me, and which, O lord, are all so sweet to the ear. O foremost of<br>Brahmanas, avarice and lust I have none, and neither fear nor pride nor<br>vanity. I shall, therefore, O lord, follow all that thou hast told me."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having listened to the words of the intelligent<br>Markandeya, the sons of Pandu, O king, along with the wielder of the bow<br>called Saranga, and all those bulls among Brahmanas, and all others that<br>were there, became filled with joy. And having heard those blessed words<br>appertaining to olden time, from Markandeya gifted with wisdom, their<br>hearts were filled with wonder."
