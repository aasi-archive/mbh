                            "The messenger of the gods said, 'O great sage, thou art of simple<br>understanding; since, having secured that celestial bliss which bringeth<br>great honour, thou art still deliberating like an unwise person. O Muni,<br>that region which is known as heaven, existeth there above us. Those<br>regions tower high, and are furnished with excellent paths, and are, O<br>sage, always ranged by celestial cars. Atheists, and untruthful persons,<br>those that have not practised ascetic austerities and those that have not<br>performed great sacrifices, cannot repair thither. Only men of virtuous<br>souls, and those of subdued spirits, and those that have their faculties<br>in subjection, and those that have controlled their senses, and those<br>that are free from malice, and persons intent on the practice of charity;<br>and heroes, and men bearing marks of battle, after having, with subdued<br>senses and faculties, performed the most meritorious rites, attain those<br>regions, O Brahmana, capable of being obtained only by virtuous acts, and<br>inhabited by pious men. There, O Mudgala, are established separately<br>myriads of beautiful, shining, and resplendent worlds bestowing every<br>object of desire, owned by those celestial beings, the gods, the Sadhyas,<br>and the Vaiswas, the great sages, Yamas, and the Dharmas, and the<br>Gandharvas and the Apsaras. And there is that monarch of mountains the<br>golden Meru extending over a space of thirty-three thousand Yojanas. And<br>there, O Mudgala, are the sacred gardens of the celestials, with Nandana<br>at their head, where sport the persons of meritorious acts. And neither<br>hunger, nor thirst, nor lassitude, nor fear, nor anything that is<br>disgusting or inauspicious is there. And all the odours of that place are<br>delightful, and all the breezes delicious to the touch. And all the<br>sounds there are captivating, O sage, to the ear and the heart. And<br>neither grief, nor decrepitude, nor labour, nor repentance also is there.<br>That world, O Muni, obtained as the fruit of one's own acts, is of this<br>nature. Persons repair thither by virtue of their meritorious deeds. And<br>the persons of those that dwell there look resplendent, and this, O<br>Mudgala, solely by virtue of their own acts, and not owing to the merits<br>of father or mothers. And there is neither sweat, nor stench, nor urine<br>there. And, there, O Muni, dust doth not soils one's garments. And their<br>excellent garlands, redolent of divine fragrance, never fade. And, O<br>Brahmana, they yoke such cars as this (that I have brought). And, O<br>mighty sage, devoid of envy and grief and fatigue and ignorance and<br>malice, men who have attained heaven, dwell in those regions happily.<br>And, O bull among Munis, higher and higher over such regions there are<br>others endued with higher celestial virtues. Of these, the beautiful and<br>resplendent regions of Brahma are the foremost. Thither, O Brahmana,<br>repair Rishis that have been sanctified by meritorious acts. And there<br>dwell certain beings named Ribhus. They are the gods of the gods<br>themselves. Their regions are supremely blessed, and are adored even by<br>the deities. These shine by their own light, and bestow every object of<br>desire. They suffer no pangs that women might cause, do not possess<br>worldly wealth, and are free from guile. The Ribhus do not subsist on<br>oblations, nor yet on ambrosia. And they are endued with such celestial<br>forms that they cannot be perceived by the senses. And these eternal gods<br>of the celestials do not desire happiness for happiness' sake, nor do<br>they change at the revolution of a Kalpa. Where, indeed, is their<br>decrepitude or dissolution? For them there is neither ecstasy, nor joy,<br>nor happiness. They have neither happiness nor misery. Wherefore should<br>they have anger or aversion then, O Muni? O Mudgala, their supreme state<br>is coveted even by the gods. And that crowning emancipation, hard to<br>attain, can never be acquired by people subject to desire. The number of<br>those deities is thirty-three. To their regions repair wise men, after<br>having observed excellent vows, or bestowed gifts according to the<br>ordinance. Thou also hast easily acquired that success by thy charities.<br>Do thou, by effulgence displayed by virtue of thy ascetic austerities,<br>enjoy that condition obtained by thy meritorious acts. Such, O Brahmana,<br>is the bliss of heaven containing various worlds.<br><br>"Thus have I described unto thee the blessing of the celestial regions.<br>Do thou now hear from me some of the disadvantages thereof. That in the<br>celestial regions a person, while reaping the fruit of the acts he hath<br>already performed, cannot be engaged in any others, and that he must<br>enjoy the consequences of the former until they are completely exhausted,<br>and, further, that he is subject to fall after he hath entirely exhausted<br>his merit, form, in my opinion, the disadvantages of heaven. The fall of<br>a person whose mind hath been steeped in happiness, must, O Mudgala, be<br>pronounced as a fault. And the discontent and regret that must follow<br>one's stay at an inferior seat after one hath enjoyed more auspicious and<br>brighter regions, must be hard to bear. And the consciousness of those<br>about to fall is stupefied, and also agitated by emotions. And as the<br>garlands of those about to fall fade away, fear invadeth their hearts.<br>These mighty drawbacks, O Mudgala, extend even to the regions of Brahma.<br>In the celestial regions, the virtues of men who have performed righteous<br>acts, are countless. And, O Muni, this is another of the attributes of<br>the fallen that, by reason of their merits, they take birth among men.<br>And then they attain to high fortune and happiness. If one, however,<br>cannot acquire knowledge here, one cometh by an inferior birth. The<br>fruits of acts done in this world are reaped in the next. This world, O<br>Brahmana, hath been declared to be one of acts; the others, as one of<br>fruit. Thus have I, O Mudgala, asked by thee, described all unto thee.<br>Now, O pious one, with thy favour, we shall easily set out with speed.'<br><br>"Vyasa continued, 'Having heard this speech, Mudgala began to reflect in<br>his mind. And having deliberated well, that best of Munis spake thus unto<br>the celestial messenger, 'O messenger of the gods, I bow unto thee. Do<br>thou, O sire, depart in peace. I have nothing to do with either<br>happiness, or heaven having such prominent defects. Persons who enjoy<br>heaven suffer, after all, huge misery and extreme regret in this world.<br>Therefore, I do not desire heaven. I shall seek for that unfailing region<br>repairing whither people have not to lament, or to be pained, or<br>agitated. Thou hast described unto me these great defects belonging to<br>the celestial regions. Do thou now describe unto me a region free from<br>faults.' Thereupon the celestial messenger said, 'Above the abode of<br>Brahma, there is the supreme seat of Vishnu, pure, and eternal, and<br>luminous known by the name of Para Brahma. Thither, O Brahmana, cannot<br>repair persons who are attached to the objects of the senses: nor can<br>those subject to arrogance, covetousness, ignorance, anger, and envy, go<br>to that place. It is only those that are free from affection, and those<br>free from pride, and those free from conflicting emotions, and those that<br>have restrained their senses, and those given to contemplation and Yoga,<br>that can repair thither.' Having heard these words, the Muni bade<br>farewell to the celestial messenger, and that virtuous one leading the<br>Unchha mode of life, assumed perfect contentment. And then praise and<br>dispraise became equal unto him; and a brickbat, stone, and gold assumed<br>the same aspect in his eyes. And availing himself of the means of<br>attaining Brahma, he became always engaged in meditation. And having<br>obtained power by means of knowledge, and acquired excellent<br>understanding, he attained that supreme state of emancipation which is<br>regarded as Eternal. Therefore, thou also, O Kunti's son, ought not to<br>grieve. Deprived thou hast truly been of a flourishing kingdom, but thou<br>wilt regain it by thy ascetic austerities. Misery after happiness, and<br>happiness after misery, revolve by turns round a man even like the point<br>of a wheel's circumference round the axle. After the thirteenth year hath<br>passed away, thou wilt, O thou of immeasurable might, get back the<br>kingdom possessed before thee by thy father and grand-father. Therefore,<br>let the fever of thy heart depart!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued "Having said this to Pandu's son, the worshipful<br>Vyasa went back to his hermitage for the purpose of performing<br>austerities."
