                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O Krishna, why wert thou absent (from the Anartta<br>country)? And, O descendant of the Vrishni race, while thou wert away,<br>where didst thou dwell? And what didst thou do while out of thy kingdom?'<br><br>"Krishna said, 'O bull of the Bharata race, I had gone for the purpose of<br>destroying the (arranging) city Salwa. And, O foremost of the Kauravas,<br>listen to the reasons I had for so doing! The heroic son of Damaghosha,<br>the well-known king Sisupala of mighty arms and great energy, was slain<br>by me, O best of Bharatas, at thy Rajasuya sacrifice, because that wicked<br>one could not from anger bear to see the first worship offered to me!<br>Hearing that he had been slain, Salwa, burning with fierce anger, came to<br>Dwaraka, while, O Bharata, it was empty, myself being away, residing with<br>you here. And having arrived there on a car made of precious metals and<br>hence called the Souva, he had an encounter with the youthful princes of<br>the Vrishni race&#8212;those bulls of that line&#8212;and fought With them<br>mercilessly. And slaughtering many youthful Vrishnis of heroic valour,<br>the wicked one devastated all the gardens of the city. And, O thou of<br>mighty arms, he said, 'Where is that wretch of the Vrishni race,<br>Vasudeva, the evil-souled son of Vasudeva? I will humble in battle the<br>pride of that person so eager for fight! Tell me truly, O Anarttas! I<br>will go there where he is. And after killing that slayer of Kansa and<br>Kesi, will I return! By my weapon I swear that I will not return with out<br>slaying him!' And exclaiming repeatedly&#8212;Where is he? Where is he? the<br>lord of Saubha rusheth to this place and that, desirous of encountering<br>me in battle? And Salwa also said, 'Impelled by wrath for the destruction<br>of Sisupala I shall today send to the mansion of Yama that treacherous<br>miscreant of mean mind?' And, O king, he further said, 'That Janardana<br>shall I slay, who, wretch that he is, hath killed my brother who was but<br>a boy of tender years, and who was slain not on the field of battle,<br>unprepared as he was!' Having, O great king, wailed thus, and having, O<br>son of the Kuru race, abused me thus, he rose into the sky on his car of<br>precious metals capable of going anywhere at will! On returning (to my<br>kingdom) I heard what, O Kaurava, the evil-minded and wicked king of<br>Maticka had said regarding myself! And, O descendant of the Kuru race, I<br>was agitated with wrath, and, O king, having reflected upon everything, I<br>set my heart upon slaying him! And, learning, O Kauravya, of his<br>oppression of the Anarttas, of his abuse of myself, and of his excessive<br>arrogance, I resolved upon the destruction of that wretch! And, O lord of<br>earth, I accordingly set out (from my city), for slaying the (lord of)<br>the Saubha. And searching him here and there, I found him in an island in<br>the midst of the ocean! Then, O king, blowing my conch called the<br>Panchajanya obtained from the sea, and challenging Salwa to combat, I<br>stood for the fight! At that instant, I had an encounter with numerous<br>Danavas, all of whom, however, I subdued and prostrated on the ground. O<br>mighty-armed one, it was owing to this affair that I could not then come<br>(unto thee)! As soon as I heard of the unfair game of dice at Hastinapur,<br>I have come here desirous of seeing ye who have been plunged in<br>distress.'"
