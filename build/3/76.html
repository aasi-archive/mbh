                            "Vrihadaswa said, 'Beholding the agitation of the virtuous and wise Nala,<br>Kesini returned unto Damayanti and related everything unto her. And<br>thereupon Damayanti with a sorrowful heart and eager to behold Nala,<br>again despatched Kesini to her mother, asking her to say on her behalf:<br>Suspecting Vahuka to be Nala, I have tried him in various ways. My doubt<br>now only relates to his appearance. I intend to examine him myself. O<br>mother, either let him enter the palace, or give me permission to go to<br>him. And arrange this with the knowledge of my father or without it. And<br>thus addressed to Damayanti, that lady communicated unto Bhima the<br>intention of his daughter, and upon learning it the king gave his<br>consent. And, O bull of the Bharata race, having obtained the consent<br>both of her father and mother, Damayanti caused Nala to be brought to her<br>apartments. And as soon as he saw Damayanti unexpectedly, king Nala was<br>overwhelmed with grief and sorrow, and bathed in tears. And that best of<br>women, Damayanti, also, upon beholding king Nala in that condition, was<br>sorely afflicted with grief. And, O monarch, herself clad in a piece of<br>red cloth, and wearing matted locks, and covered with dirt and dust,<br>Damayanti then addressed Vahuka, saying, 'O Vahuka, hast thou ever seen<br>any person acquainted with duty, who hath gone away, deserting his<br>sleeping wife in the forest? Who, except the virtuous Nala, could go<br>away, deserting in the woods, his dear and unoffending wife overcome with<br>fatigue? Of what offence was I guilty in the eyes of that monarch since<br>my early youth that he should go away deserting me in the woods while<br>asleep overcome with fatigue? Why should he whom I formerly chose in<br>preference to the gods themselves abandon his ever-devoted and loving<br>wife who had become the mother also of his children? Before the fire, and<br>in presence also of the celestials, he had taken my hand, vowing, 'Verily<br>I will be thine.' Oh, where was that vow when he deserted me. O represser<br>of foes.' While Damayanti was saying all this, tears of sorrow began to<br>flow plentifully from her eyes. And beholding her thus afflicted with<br>grief, Nala also, shedding tears, black of those of the gazelle with<br>extremities of reddish hue, said, 'O timid one, neither the loss of my<br>kingdom nor my desertion of thee was my act. Both were due to Kali. And,<br>O foremost of virtuous women, lamenting for me day and night, and<br>overcome with sorrow, thou hadst in the woods cursed Kali, and so he<br>began to dwell in my body, burning in consequence of thy curse. Indeed<br>burning with thy curse, he lived within me like fire within fire. O<br>blessed girl, that our sorrows might terminate, that wretch have I<br>overcome by my observances and austerities. The sinful wretch hath<br>already left me, and it is for this that I have come hither. My presence<br>here, O fair lady, is for thy sake. I have no other object. But, O timid<br>one, can any other woman, forsaking her loving and devoted husband, ever<br>choose a second lord like thee? At the command of the king, messengers<br>are ranging this entire earth, saying, 'Bhima's daughter will, of her own<br>accord, choose a second husband worthy of her.' Immediately on hearing<br>this, the son of Bhangasura hath arrived here.' Hearing these<br>lamentations of Nala, Damayanti, frightened and trembling, said with<br>joined hand, 'It behoveth thee not, O blessed one, to suspect any fault<br>in me. O ruler of the Nishadhas, passing over the celestials themselves,<br>I choose thee as my lord. It was to bring thee hither that the Brahmanas<br>had gone out in all directions, even to all the sides of the horizon,<br>singing my words, in the form of ballads. At last, O king, a learned<br>Brahmana named Parnada had found thee in Kosala in the palace of<br>Rituparna. When thou hadst returned a fit answer to those words of his,<br>it was then, O Naishadha, that I devised this scheme to recover thee.<br>Except thee, O lord of earth, there is no one in this world, who in one<br>day can clear, O King, a hundred yojanas with horses. O monarch, touching<br>thy feet I can swear truly that I have not, even in thought, committed<br>any sin. May the all-witnessing Air that courseth through this world,<br>take my life, if I have committed any sin. May the Sun that ever courseth<br>through the sky take my life, if I have committed any sin. May the Moon,<br>that dwelleth within every creature as a witness, take my life, if I have<br>committed any sin. Let the three gods that sustain the triple worlds in<br>their entirety, declare truly, or let them forsake me today.' And thus<br>addressed by her, the Wind-god said from the sky, 'O Nala, I tell thee<br>truly that she hath done no wrong. O king, Damayanti, well guarding the<br>honour of thy family, hath enhanced it. Of this we are the witnesses, as<br>we have been her protectors for these three years. It is for thy sky that<br>she hath devised this unrivalled scheme, for, except thee, none on earth<br>is capable of travelling in a single day a hundred yojanas. O monarch,<br>thou hast obtained Bhima's daughter, and she hath also obtained thee.<br>Thou needst not entertain any suspicion but be united with thy partner.'<br>And after the Wind-god had said this, a floral shower fell there and the<br>celestial kettle-drum began to play, and auspicious breezes began to<br>blow. And beholding those wonders, O Bharata, king Nala, the represser of<br>foes, cast away all his doubts in respect of Damayanti. And then that<br>lord of earth, remembering the king of serpents, wore that pure garment<br>and regained his native form. And beholding her righteous lord in his own<br>form, Bhima's daughter of faultless limbs embraced him, and began to weep<br>aloud. And king Nala also embraced Bhima's daughter devoted to him, as<br>before, and also his children, and experienced great delight. And burying<br>her face in his bosom, the beauteous Damayanti of large eyes began to<br>sigh heavily, remembering her griefs. And overwhelmed with sorrow, that<br>tiger among men stood for some time, clasping the dust-covered Damayanti<br>of sweet smiles. And, O king, the queen-mother then, with a glad heart,<br>told Bhima all that had passed between Nala and Damayanti. And the mighty<br>monarch answered, 'Let Nala pass this day in peace, to-morrow I shall see<br>him after his bath and prayers, with Damayanti by his side.' And, O king,<br>they passed that night pleasantly, in relating to each other the past<br>incidents of their life in the forest. And with hearts filled with joy,<br>the princess of Vidarbha and Nala began to pass their days in the palace<br>of king Bhima, intent upon making each other happy. And it was in the<br>fourth year (after the loss of his kingdom) that Nala was re-united with<br>his wife, and all his desires gratified, once more experienced the<br>highest bliss. And Damayanti rejoiced exceedingly in having recovered her<br>lord even as fields of tender plants on receiving a shower. And Bhima's<br>daughter, thus recovering her lord, obtained her wish, and blazed forth<br>in beauty, her weariness gone, her anxieties dispelled and herself<br>swelling with joy, ever like a night that is lit by the bright disc of<br>the moon!"
