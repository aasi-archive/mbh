                            Vaisampayana said, "And it came to pass that at this time a Suta named<br>Adhiratha, who was a friend of Dhritarashtra, came to the river Ganga,<br>accompanied by his wife. And, O king, his wife named Radha was<br>unparalleled on earth for beauty. And although that highly blessed dame<br>had made great endeavours to obtain a son, yet she had failed, O<br>represser of foes, to obtain one. And on coming to the river Ganga, she<br>beheld a box drifting along the current. And containing articles capable<br>of protecting from dangers and decked with unguents, that box was brought<br>before her by the waves of the Janhavi. And attracted by curiosity, the<br>lady caused it to be seized. And she then related all unto Adhiratha of<br>the charioteer caste. And hearing this Adhiratha took away the box from<br>the water-side, and opened it by means of instruments. And then he beheld<br>a boy resembling the morning Sun. And the infant was furnished with<br>golden mail, and looked exceedingly beautiful with a face decked in<br>ear-rings. And thereupon the charioteer, together with his wife, was<br>struck with such astonishment that their eyes expanded in wonder. And<br>taking the infant on his lap, Adhiratha said unto his wife, 'Ever since I<br>was born, O timid lady, I had never seen such a wonder. This child that<br>hath come to us must be of celestial birth. Surely, sonless as I am, it<br>is the gods that have sent him unto me!' Saying this, O lord of earth, he<br>gave the infant to Radha. And thereat, Radha adopted, according to the<br>ordinance, that child of celestial form and divine origin, and possessed<br>of the splendour of the filaments of the lotus and furnished with<br>excellent grace. And duly reared by her, that child endued with great<br>prowess began to grow up. And after Karna's adoption, Adhiratha had other<br>sons begotten by himself. And seeing the child furnished with bright mail<br>and golden ear-rings, the twice-born ones named him Vasusena. And thus<br>did that child endued with great splendour and immeasurable prowess<br>became the son of the charioteer, and came to be known as Vasusena and<br>Vrisha. And Pritha learnt through spies that her own son clad in<br>celestial mail was growing up amongst the Angas as the eldest son of a<br>charioteer (Adhiratha). And seeing that in process of time his son had<br>grown up, Adhiratha sent him to the city named after the elephant. And<br>there Karna put up with Drona, for the purpose of learning arms. And that<br>powerful youth contracted a friendship with Duryodhana. And having<br>acquired all the four kinds of weapons from Drona, Kripa, and Rama, he<br>became famous in the world as a mighty bowman. And after having<br>contracted a friendship with Dhritarashtra's son, he became intent on<br>injuring the sons of Pritha. And he was always desirous of fighting with<br>the high-souled Falguna. And, O king, ever since they first saw each<br>other, Karna always used to challenge Arjuna, and Arjuna, on his part,<br>used to challenge him. This, O foremost of kings, was without doubt, the<br>secret known to the Sun, viz., begot by himself on Kunti, Karna was being<br>reared in the race of the Sutas. And beholding him decked with his<br>ear-rings and mail, Yudhishthira thought him to be unslayable in fight,<br>and was exceedingly pained at it. And when, O foremost of monarchs, Karna<br>after rising from the water, used at mid-day to worship the effulgent<br>Surya with joined hands, the Brahmanas used to solicit him for wealth.<br>And at that time there was nothing that he would not give away to the<br>twice-born ones. And Indra, assuming the guise of a Brahmana, appeared<br>before him (at such a time) and said, 'Give me!' And thereupon Radha's<br>son replied unto him, 'Thou art welcome!'"
