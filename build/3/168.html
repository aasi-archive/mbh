                            "Arjuna continued, 'Then at places eulogised by the Maharshis, I<br>(proceeded, and at length) beheld the ocean&#8212;that inexhaustible lord of<br>waters. And like unto flowing cliffs were seen on it heaving billows, now<br>meeting together and now rolling away. And there (were seen) all around<br>barks by thousands filled with gems. And there were seen timingilas and<br>tortoises and makaras like unto rock submerged in water. And on all sides<br>round thousands of shells sunk in water appeared like star in the night<br>covered by light clouds. And thousands upon thousands of gem were<br>floating in heaps and a violent wind was blowing about in whirls&#8212;and<br>this was wonderful to behold. And having beheld that excellent lord of<br>all waters with powerful tides, I saw at a short distance the city of the<br>demons filled with the Danavas. And even there, eftsoons entering<br>underneath the earth, Matali skilled in guiding the car, sitting fast on<br>the chariot drove it with force; and he dashed on, frightening that city<br>with the rattling of his chariot. And hearing that rattling of the<br>chariot like unto the rumbling of the clouds in the sky, the Danavas,<br>thinking me to be the lord of the celestials, became agitated. And<br>thereupon they all, frightened at heart, stood holding in their hands<br>bows and arrows and swords and javelins and axes and maces and clubs.<br>Then having made arrangements for the defence of the city, the Danavas,<br>with minds alarmed, shut the gates, so that nothing could be discovered.<br>Thereupon taking my shell, Devadatta, of tremendous roars, I again and<br>again winded it with exceeding cheerfulness. And filling all the<br>firmament, those sounds produced echoes. Thereat mighty beings were<br>terrified and they hid (themselves). And then, O Bharata, all of them<br>adorned with ornaments, those offsprings of Diti&#8212;the<br>Nivata-Kavachas&#8212;made their appearance by thousands, donning diverse mail<br>and taking in their hands various weapons and equipped with mighty iron<br>javelins and maces and clubs and hatchets and sabres and discs and<br>sataghnis and bhusundis and variegated and ornamented swords. Then, after<br>deliberating much as to the course of the car, Matali began to guide the<br>steeds on a (piece of) level ground, O foremost of the Bharatas. And<br>owing to the swiftness of those fleet coursers conducted by him, I could<br>see nothing&#8212;and this was strange. Then the Danavas there began to sound<br>thousands of musical instruments, dissonant and of odd shapes. And at<br>those sounds, fishes by hundreds and by thousands, like unto hills,<br>having their senses bewildered by that noise, fled suddenly. And mighty<br>force flew at me, the demons discharging sharpened shafts by hundreds and<br>by thousands. And then, O Bharata, there ensued a dreadful conflict<br>between me and the demons, calculated to extinguish the Nivata-Kavachas.<br>And there came to the mighty battle the Devarshis and the Danavarshis and<br>the Brahmarshis and the Siddhas. And desirous of victory, the Munis<br>eulogised me with the same sweet-speeches that (they had eulogised) Indra<br>with, at the war, (which took place) for the sake of Tara.'"
