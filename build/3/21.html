                            "Vasudeva said, 'O thou tiger among men, my great enemy king Salwa, thus<br>encountered by me in battle, again ascended the sky. And O mighty<br>monarch, inspired with the desire of victory, that wicked one hurled at<br>me Sataghnis, and mighty maces, and flaming lances, and stout clubs, and<br>as the weapons came along the sky, I speedily resisted them with my swift<br>arrows, and cut them in two or three pieces before they came at me. And<br>there was a great noise in the welkins. And Salwa covered Daruka, and my<br>steeds, and my car also with hundreds of straight shafts. Then, O hero,<br>Daruka, evidently about to faint, said unto me, 'Afflicted with the<br>shafts of Salwa I stay in the field, because it is my duty to do so. But<br>I am incapable of doing so (any longer). My body hath become weak!'<br>Hearing these piteous words of my charioteer, I looked at him, and found<br>the driver wounded with arrows. Nor was there a spot on his breasts or<br>the crown of his head, or body or his arms which was not, O thou foremost<br>of sons of Pandu, covered with shafts! And blood flowed profusely from<br>his wounds inflicted by arrows, and he looked like unto a mountain of red<br>chalk after a heavy shower. And, O thou of mighty arms, seeing the<br>charioteer with the reins in his hands thus pierced and enfeebled by the<br>shafts of Salwa in the field of battle, I cheered him up!<br><br>"'And, O Bharata, about this time, a certain person, having his home in<br>Dwaraka quickly coming to my car, addressed me like a friend, delivering<br>to me, O hero, a message from Ahuka! He seemed to be one of Ahuka's<br>followers. And sadly and in a voice choked in sorrow, know, O<br>Yudhishthira, he said words'&#8212;O warrior, Ahuka, the lord of Dwaraka, hath<br>said these words unto thee! O Kesava, hear what thy father's friend<br>sayeth: O son of the Vrishni race, O thou irrepressible one, in thy<br>absence today Salwa, coming to Dwaraka, hath by main force killed<br>Vasudeva! Therefore, no need of battle any more. Cease, O Janardana! Do<br>thou defend Dwaraka! This is thy principal duty!&#8212;Hearing these words of<br>his, my heart became heavy, and I could not ascertain what I should do<br>and what I should not. And, O hero, hearing of that great misfortune, I<br>mentally censured Satyaki, and Baladeva, and also that mighty pradyumna.<br>Having reposed on them the duty of protecting Dwaraka and Vasudeva, I had<br>gone, O son of the Kuru race, to effect the destruction of Salwa's city.<br>And in a sorrowful heart, I asked myself,&#8212;Doth that destroyer of foes,<br>the mighty-armed Baladeva, live, and Satyaki, and the son of Rukmini and<br>Charudeshna possessed of prowess, and Shamva and others? For, O thou<br>tiger among men, these living, even the bearer himself of the thunderbolt<br>could by no means destroy Suta's son (Vasudeva)! And thought, I, It is<br>plain that Vasudeva is dead and equally plain that the others with<br>Baladeva at their head have been deprived of life&#8212;This was my certain<br>conclusion. And, O mighty king, thinking of the destruction of those all,<br>I was overwhelmed with grief! And it was in this state of mind that I<br>encountered Salwa afresh. And now I saw, O great monarch, Vasudeva<br>himself falling from the car of precious metals! And, O warrior I swooned<br>away, and, O king of men, my sire seemed like unto Yayati after the loss<br>of his merit, falling towards the earth from heaven! And like unto a<br>luminary whose merit hath been lost saw my father falling, his head-gear<br>foul and flowing loosely, and his hair and dress disordered. And then the<br>bow Sharanga dropped from my hand, and, O son of Kunti I swooned away! I<br>sat down on the side of the car. And, O thou descendant of the Bharata<br>race, seeing me deprived of consciousness on the car, and as if dead, my<br>entire host exclaimed Oh! and Alas! And my prone father with<br>out-stretched arms and lower limbs, appeared like a dropping bird. And<br>him thus falling, O thou of mighty arms, O hero, the hostile warriors<br>bearing in their hands lances and axes struck grievously! And (beholding<br>this) my heart trembled! and soon regaining my consciousness, O warrior,<br>I could not see in that mighty contest either the car of costly metals,<br>or the enemy Salwa, or my old father! Then I concluded in my mind that it<br>was certainly illusion. And recovering my senses, I again began to<br>discharge arrows by hundreds."
