                            "Kunti said, 'According to thy promise, I will, O king, with concentrated<br>mind, serve that Brahmana. O foremost of kings, I do not say this<br>falsely. It is my nature to worship Brahmanas. And, as in the present<br>case, my doing so would be agreeable to thee, even this would be highly<br>conducive to my welfare. Whether that worshipful one cometh in the<br>evening, or in morning, or at night or even at midnight, he will have no<br>reason to be angry with me! O foremost of kings, to do good by serving<br>the twice-born ones, observing all thy commands, is what I consider to be<br>highly profitable to me, O best of men! Do thou, therefore, O foremost of<br>monarchs rely on me! That best of Brahmanas, while residing in thy house,<br>shall never have cause for dissatisfaction. I tell thee truly. I shall, O<br>king, be always attentive to that which is agreeable to this Brahmana,<br>and what is fraught also with good to thee. O sinless one! I know full<br>well that Brahmanas that are eminently virtuous, when propitiated bestow<br>salvation, and when displeased, are capable of bringing about destruction<br>upon the offender. Therefore, I shall please this foremost of Brahmanas.<br>Thou wilt not, O monarch, come to any grief from that best of regenerate<br>persons, owing to any act of mine. In consequence of the transgressions<br>of monarchs, Brahmanas, O foremost of kings, became the cause of evil to<br>them, as Chyavana had become, in consequence of the act of Sukanya. I<br>will, therefore, O king, with great regularity, wait upon that best of<br>Brahmanas according to thy instructions in that respect!' And when she<br>had thus spoken at length, the king embraced and cheered her, and<br>instructed her in detail as to what should be done by her. And the king<br>said, 'Thou shall, O gentle maid, act even thus, without fear, for my<br>good as also thy own, and for the good of thy race also, O thou of<br>faultless limbs!' And having said this the illustrious Kuntibhoja, who<br>was devoted to the Brahmanas, made over the girl Pritha to that Brahmana,<br>saying, 'This my daughter, O Brahmana, is of tender age and brought up in<br>luxury. If, therefore, she transgresses at any time, do thou not take<br>that to heart! Illustrious Brahmanas are never angry with old men,<br>children, and ascetics, even if these transgress frequently. In respect<br>of even a great wrong forgiveness is due from the regenerate. The<br>worship, therefore, O best of Brahmanas, that is offered to the best of<br>one's power and exertion, should be acceptable!' Hearing these words of<br>the monarch, the Brahmana said, 'So be it!' Thereupon, the king became<br>highly pleased and assigned unto him apartments that were white as swans<br>or the beams of the moon. And in the room intended for the sacrificial<br>fire, the king placed a brilliant seat especially constructed for him.<br>And the food and other things that were offered unto the Brahmana were of<br>the same excellent kind. And casting aside idleness and all sense of<br>self-importance, the princess addressed herself with right good will to<br>wait upon the Brahmana. And the chaste Kunti, endued with purity of<br>conduct, went thither for serving the Brahmana. And duly waiting upon<br>that Brahmana as if he were a very god, she gratified him highly."
