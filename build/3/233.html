                            Vaisampayana said, "Then Kesava, the slayer of Madhu, also called<br>Janardana, having conversed on various agreeable themes with the<br>illustrious sons of Pandu and with those Brahmanas that were headed by<br>Markandeya and having bid them farewell, mounted his car and called for<br>Satyabhama. And Satyabhama then, having embraced the daughter of Drupada,<br>addressed her in these cordial words expressive of her feelings towards<br>her: 'O Krishna, let there be no anxiety, no grief, for thee! Thou hast<br>no cause to pass thy nights in sleeplessness, for thou wilt surely obtain<br>back the earth subjugated by thy husbands, who are all equal unto the<br>gods. O thou of black eyes, women endued with such disposition and<br>possessed of such auspicious marks, can never suffer misfortune long. It<br>hath been heard by me that thou shall, with thy husbands, certainly enjoy<br>this earth peacefully and freed from all thorns! And, O daughter of<br>Drupada, thou shalt certainly behold the earth ruled by Yudhishthira<br>after the sons of Dhritarashtra have been slain and the deeds of their<br>hostility avenged! Thou wilt soon behold those wives of the Kurus, who,<br>deprived of sense by pride, laughed at thee while on thy way to exile,<br>themselves reduced to a state of helplessness and despair! Know them all,<br>O Krishna, that did thee any injury while thou wert afflicted, to have<br>already gone to the abode of Yama. Thy brave sons, Prativindhya by<br>Yudhishthira and Sutasoma by Bhima, and Srutakarman by Arjuna, and<br>Satanika by Nakula, and Srutasena begot by Sahadeva, are well and have<br>become skilled in weapons. Like Abhimanyu they are all staying at<br>Dwaravati, delighted with the place. And Subhadra also, cheerfully and<br>with her whole soul, looketh after them like thee, and like thee joyeth<br>in them and deriveth much happiness from them. Indeed, she grieveth in<br>their griefs and joyeth in their joys. And the mother of Pradyumna also<br>loveth them with her whole soul. And Kesava with his sons Bhanu and<br>others watcheth over them with especial affection. And my mother-in-law<br>is ever attentive in feeding and clothing them. And the Andhakas and<br>Vrishnis, including Rama and others, regard them with affection. And, O<br>beautiful lady, their affection for thy sons is equal unto what they feel<br>for Pradyumna.<br><br>"Having said these agreeable and truthful and cordial words, Satyabhama<br>desired to go to Vasudeva's car. And the wife of Krishna then walked<br>round the queen of the Pandavas. And having done so the beautiful<br>Satyabhama mounted the car of Krishna. And the chief of the Yadavas,<br>comforting Draupadi with a smile and causing the Pandavas to return, set<br>out for his own city, with swift horses (yoked unto his car)."
