                            "Lomasa said, 'O son of Kunti, Bharadwaja returned to his hermitage after<br>performing the ritual duties of the day, and having collected the<br>sacrificial fuel. And because his son had been slain, the sacrificial<br>fires which used to welcome him everyday, did not on that day come<br>forward to welcome him. And marking this change in the Agnihotra, the<br>great sage asked the blind Sudra warder seated there, saying, 'Why is it.<br>O Sudra, that the fires rejoice not at sight of me? Thou too dost not<br>rejoice as is thy wont. Is it all well with my hermitage? I hope that my<br>son of little sense had not gone to the sage Raivya. Answer speedily, O<br>Sudra, all these questions of mine. My mind misgiveth me.' The Sudra<br>said, 'Thy son of little sense had gone to the sage Raivya, and therefore<br>it is that lie lieth prostrate (on the ground), having been slain by a<br>powerful demon. Being attacked by the Rakshasa, holding a spear, he<br>attempted to force his way into this room, and I therefore barred his way<br>with my arms. Then desirous of having water in an unclean state, as he<br>stood hopeless, he was slain by the vehement Rakshasa, carrying a spear<br>in his hand.' On hearing from the Sudra of this great calamity,<br>Bharadwaja, sorely afflicted with grief, began to lament, embracing his<br>dead son. And he said, 'O my son, it is for the good of the Brahmanas<br>that thou didst practise penances, with the intention that the Vedas<br>unstudied by any Brahmana whatever might be manifest unto thee. Thy<br>behaviour towards the Brahmanas had always been for their good, and thou<br>hadst also been innocent in regard to all creatures. But, alas! (at last)<br>thou didst lapse into rudeness. I had prohibited thee, O my son, from<br>visiting the residence of Raivya; but alas! to that very hermitage,<br>(destructive to thee) as the god of death himself, Yama, didst thou<br>repair. Evil-minded is that man, who, (knowing that I am an old man), and<br>also that (Yavakri) was my only son, had given way to wrath. It is<br>through the agency of Raivya that I have sustained the loss of my child.<br>Without thee, O my son, I shall give up my life, the most precious thing<br>in the world. In grief for the death of my son, I renounce my life; but<br>this I say that Raivya's eldest son shall in a short time kill him<br>although he be innocent. Blessed are those to whom children have never<br>been born, for they lead a happy life, without having to experience the<br>grief (incident to the death of a child). Who in this world can be more<br>wicked than those who from affliction, and deprived of their sense by<br>sorrow consequent upon the death of a child, curse even their dearest<br>friend! I found my son dead, and, therefore, have cursed my dearest<br>friend. Ah! what second man can there be in this world, destined to<br>suffer so grievous a misfortune!' Having lamented long Bharadwaja<br>cremated his son and then himself entered into a full-blazing fire.'"
