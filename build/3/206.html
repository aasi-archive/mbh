                            "Markandeya said, 'Continually reflecting upon that wonderful discourse<br>of the woman, Kausika began to reproach himself and looked very much like<br>a guilty person and meditating on the subtle ways of morality and virtue,<br>he said to himself, 'I should accept with reverence what the lady hath<br>said and should, therefore, repair to Mithila. Without doubt there<br>dwelleth in that city a fowler of soul under complete control and fully<br>acquainted with the mysteries of virtue and morality. This very day will<br>I repair unto that one endued with wealth of asceticism for enquiring of<br>him about virtue.' His faith in her was assured by her knowledge of the<br>death of the she-crane and the excellent words of virtuous import she had<br>uttered. Kausika thus reflecting with reverence upon all she had said,<br>set out for Mithila, filled with curiosity. And he traversed many forests<br>and villages and towns and at last reached Mithila that was ruled over by<br>Janaka and he beheld the city to be adorned with the flags of various<br>creeds. And he beheld that beautiful town to be resounding with the noise<br>of sacrifices and festivities and furnished with splendid gateways. It<br>abounded with palatial residences and protected by walls on all sides; it<br>had many splendid buildings to boast of. And that delightful town was<br>also filled with innumerable cars. And its streets and roads were many<br>and well-laid and many of them were lined with shops. And it was full of<br>horses and cars and elephants and warriors. And the citizens were all in<br>health and joy and they were always engaged in festivities. And having<br>entered that city, that Brahmana beheld there many other things.<br><br>And there the Brahmana enquired about the virtuous fowler and was<br>answered by some twice-born persons. And repairing to the place indicated<br>by those regenerate ones, the Brahmana beheld the fowler seated in a<br>butcher's yard and the ascetic fowler was then selling venison and<br>buffalo meat and in consequence of the large concourse of buyers gathered<br>round that fowler, Kausika stood at a distance. But the fowler,<br>apprehending that the Brahmana had come to him, suddenly rose from his<br>seat and went to that secluded spot where the Brahmana was staying and<br>having approached him there, the fowler said, 'I salute thee, O holy one!<br>Welcome art thou, O thou best of Brahmanas! I am the fowler. Blessed be<br>thou! Command me as to what I may do for thee. The word that the chaste<br>woman said unto thee, viz., Repair thou to Mithila, are known to me. I<br>also know for what purpose thou hast come hither.' Hearing these words of<br>the fowler that Brahmana was filled with surprise. And he began to<br>reflect inwardly, saying, 'This indeed, is the second marvel that I see!'<br>The fowler then said unto the Brahmana, saying, 'Thou art now standing in<br>place that is scarcely proper for thee, O sinless one. If it pleasest<br>thee, let us go to my abode, O holy one!'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'So be it,' said the Brahmana unto him, gladly.<br>And thereupon, the fowler proceeded towards his home with the Brahmana<br>walking before him. And entering his abode that looked delightful, the<br>fowler reverenced his guest by offering him a seat. And he also gave him<br>water to wash his feet and face. And accepting these, that best of<br>Brahmanas sat at his ease And he then addressed the fowler, saying, 'It<br>seems to me that this profession doth not befit thee. O fowler, I deeply<br>regret that thou shouldst follow such a cruel trade.' At these words of<br>the Brahmana the fowler said, 'This profession is that of my family,<br>myself having inherited it from my sires and grandsires. O regenerate<br>one, grieve not for me owing to my adhering to the duties that belong to<br>me by birth. Discharging the duties ordained for me beforehand by the<br>Creator, I carefully serve my superiors and the old. O thou best of<br>Brahmanas! I always speak the truth, never envy others; and give to the<br>best of my power. I live upon what remaineth after serving the gods,<br>guests, and those that depend on me. I never speak ill of anything, small<br>or great. O thou best of Brahmanas, the actions of a former life always<br>follow the doer. In this world there are three principal professions,<br>viz., agriculture, rearing of cattle, and trade. As regards the other<br>world, the three Vedas, knowledge, and the science of morals are<br>efficacious. Service (of the other three orders) hath been ordained to be<br>the duty of the Sudra. Agriculture hath been ordained for the Vaisyas,<br>and fighting for the Kshatriyas, while the practice of the Brahmacharya<br>vow, asceticism, recitation of mantras, and truthfulness have been<br>ordained for the Brahmanas. Over subjects adhering to their proper<br>duties, the king should rule virtuously; while he should set those<br>thereto that have fallen away from the duties of their order. Kings<br>should ever be feared, because they are the lords of their subjects. They<br>restrain those subjects of theirs that fall away from their duties as<br>they restrain the motions of the deer by means of their shafts. O<br>regenerate Rishi, there existeth not in the kingdom of Janaka a single<br>subject that followeth not the duties of his birth. O thou best of the<br>Brahmanas, all the four orders here rigidly adhere to their respective<br>duties. King Janaka punisheth him that is wicked, even if he be his own<br>son; but never doth he inflict pain on him that is virtuous. With good<br>and able spies employed under him, he looketh upon all with impartial<br>eyes. Prosperity, and kingdom, and capacity to punish, belong, O thou<br>best of Brahmanas, to the Kshatriyas. Kings desire high prosperity<br>through practice of the duties that belong to them. The king is the<br>protector of all the four orders. As regards myself, O Brahmana, I always<br>sell pork and buffalo meat without slaying those animals myself. I sell<br>meat of animals, O regenerate Rishi, that have been slain by others. I<br>never eat meat myself; never go to my wife except in her season; I always<br>fast during the day, and eat, O regenerate one, in the night. Even though<br>the behaviour of his order is bad, a person may yet be himself of good<br>behaviour. So also a person may become virtuous, although he may be<br>slayer of animals by profession. It is in consequence of the sinful acts<br>of kings that virtue decreaseth greatly, and sin beginneth to prosper.<br>And when all this taketh place the subjects of the kingdom begin to<br>decay. And it is then, O Brahmana, that ill-looking monsters, and dwarfs,<br>and hunch-backed and large-headed wights, and men that are blind or deaf<br>or those that have paralysed eyes or are destitute of the power of<br>procreation, begin to take their birth. It is from the sinfulness of<br>kings that their subjects suffer numerous mischiefs. But this our king<br>Janaka casteth his eyes upon all his subjects virtuously, and he is<br>always kind unto them who, on their part, ever adhere to their respective<br>duties. Regarding myself, I always with good deeds please those that<br>speak well, as also those that speak ill of me. Those kings that live in<br>the observance of their own proper duties, who are always engaged in the<br>practice of acts that are good and honest, who are of souls under<br>complete control and who are endued with readiness and alacrity, may not<br>depend upon anything else for supporting their power. Gift of food to the<br>best of one's power, endurance of heat and cold, firmness in virtue, and<br>a regard and tenderness for all creatures,&#8212;these attributes can never<br>find place in a person, without an innate desire being present in him of<br>separating himself from the world. One should avoid falsehood in speech,<br>and should do good without solicitation. One should never cast off virtue<br>from lust, from wrath, or from malice. One should never joy immoderately<br>at a good turn or grieve immoderately at a bad one. One should never feel<br>depressed when overtaken by poverty, nor when so overtaken abandon the<br>path of virtue. If at any time one doth what is wrong, he should never do<br>its like again. One should always urge his soul to the doing of that<br>which he regardeth as beneficial. One should never return wrong for<br>wrong, but should act honestly by those that have wronged him. That<br>wretched man who desireth to do what is sinful, slayeth himself. By doing<br>what is sinful, one only imitates them that are wicked and sinful,<br>Disbelieving in virtue they that mock the good and the pure saying,<br>'There is no virtue' undoubtedly meet with destruction. A sinful man<br>swelleth up like a leather bag puffed up with wind. The thoughts of these<br>wretches filled with pride and folly are feeble and unprofitable. It is<br>the heart, the inner soul, that discovereth the fool like the sun that<br>discovereth forms during the day. The food cannot always shine in the<br>world by means of self-praise. The learned man, however, even if he be<br>destitute of beauty, displayeth his lustre by refraining from speaking<br>ill of others and well of himself. No example, however, can be met with,<br>in this world, of a person shining brilliantly on account of attributes<br>to be found in him in their reputed measure. If one repenteth of a wrong<br>done by him, that repentance washeth off his sin. The resolution of never<br>doing it again saveth him from future sin, even as, O thou best of<br>Brahmanas, he may save himself from sin by any of those expiations<br>obtained in the scriptures. Even this, O regenerate one, is the sruti<br>that may be seen in respect of virtue. He that having before been<br>virtuous, committeth a sin, or committeth it unknowingly may destroy that<br>sin. For virtue, O Brahmana, driveth off the sin that men commit from<br>ignorance. A man, after having committed a sin, should cease to regard<br>himself any longer as a man. No man can conceal his sins. The gods behold<br>what one does, also the Being that is within every one. He that with<br>piety and without detraction hideth the faults of the honest and the wise<br>like holes in his own attire, surely seeketh his salvation. If a man<br>seeketh redemption after having committed a sin, without doubt he is<br>purged of all his sins and looketh pure and resplendent like the moon<br>emerged from the clouds. A man that seeketh redemption is washed of all<br>his sins, even as the sun, upon rising, dispelleth all darkness. O best<br>of Brahmanas, it is temptation that constitutes the basis of sin. Men<br>that are ignorant commit sin, yielding to temptation alone. Sinful men<br>generally cover themselves with a virtuous exterior, like wells whose<br>mouths are covered by long grass. Outwardly they seem to possess<br>self-control and holiness and indulge in preaching virtuous texts which,<br>in their mouth are of little meaning. Indeed, everything may be noticed<br>in them except conduct that is truly virtuous!'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'At these words, O best of men, of the fowler,<br>that Brahmana endued with great wisdom, then asked the fowler, saying,<br>'How shall I know what is virtuous conduct? Blessed be thou, I desire to<br>hear this, O thou foremost of virtuous men, from thee. Therefore, O thou<br>of exalted soul, tell me all about it truly.' Hearing these words, the<br>fowler replied, saying, 'O best of Brahmanas, Sacrifices, Gift,<br>Asceticism, the Vedas, and Truth&#8212;these five holy things are ever present<br>in conduct that is called virtuous. Having subjugated lust and wrath<br>pride avarice, and crookedness, they that take pleasure in virtue because<br>it is virtue, are regarded as really virtuous and worthy of the<br>approbation of persons that are virtuous. These persons who are devoted<br>to sacrifices; and study of the Vedas have no independent behaviour. They<br>follow only the practices of the honest and the good. This indeed, is the<br>second attribute of the virtuous. Waiting upon superiors, Truth, Freedom<br>from anger, and Gift, these four, O Brahmana, are inseparably connected<br>with behaviour that is virtuous. For the reputation that a person<br>acquires by setting his heart on virtuous behaviour and adhering to it<br>rigidly is incapable of acquisition except by practising the four virtues<br>named above. The essence of the Vedas is Truth: the essence of Truth is<br>self-control, and the essence of self-control is abstention from the<br>pleasures of the world. These all are to be noticed in behaviour that is<br>virtuous. They that follow those deluded fools that mock the forms of<br>faith prevailing among men, are dragged into destruction for walking in<br>such a sinful path. They, however, that are virtuous and engaged in the<br>observance of vows, who are devoted to the srutis and the virtue of<br>abstention from the pleasure of the world, they in fact who tread in<br>virtue's path and follow the true religion, they that are obedient to the<br>mandates of their preceptors, and who reflect upon the sense of the<br>scriptures with patience and carefulness,&#8212;is these that are said to be<br>possessed of behaviour that is virtuous; it is these, O Brahmana, that<br>are said to properly guide their higher intelligence. Forsaking those<br>that are atheists, those that transgress virtue's limits, those that are<br>of wicked souls, those that live in sinfulness, betake thyself to<br>knowledge reverencing those that are virtuous. Lust and temptation are<br>even like sharks in the river of life; the waters are the five senses. Do<br>thou cross over to the other side of this river in the boat of patience<br>and resignation, avoiding the shoals of corporeal existence (repeated<br>births in this world). The supreme virtue consisting in the exercise of<br>the intelligent principle and abstraction, when gradually super-added to<br>virtuous conduct, becomes beautiful like dye on white fabrics.<br>Truthfulness and abstention from doing injury to any one, are virtues<br>highly beneficial to all creatures. Of these, that latter is a cardinal<br>virtue, and is based on truth. Our mental faculties have their proper<br>play when their foundation is laid in truth, and in the exercise of<br>virtue truth is of the highest value. Purity of conduct is the<br>characteristic of all good men. Those that are distinguished for holy<br>living are good and virtuous. All creatures follow the principles of<br>conduct which are innate in their nature. The sinful being who has no<br>control over self acquire lust, anger and other vices. It is the<br>immemorial rule that virtuous actions are those that are founded on<br>justice, and it is also ordained by holy men that all iniquitous conduct<br>is sin. Those who are not swayed by anger, pride, haughtiness and envy,<br>and those who are quiet and straight-forward, are men of virtuous<br>conduct. Those who are diligent in performing the rites enjoined in the<br>three Vedas, who are wise, and of pure and virtuous conduct, who exercise<br>self-restraint and are full of attention to their superior, are men of<br>virtuous conduct. The actions and conduct of such men of great power, are<br>very difficult of attainment. They are sanctified by the purification of<br>their own actions, and consequently sin in them dies out of itself. This<br>virtue of good conduct is wonderful, ancient, immutable and eternal; and<br>wise men observing this virtue with holiness, attain to heaven. These men<br>who believe in the existence of the Deity, who are free from false pride,<br>and versed in holy writ, and who respect regenerate (twice-born) men, go<br>to heaven. Among holy men, virtue is differentiated in three ways&#8212;that<br>great virtue which is inculcated in the Vedas, the other which is<br>inculcated in the dharmashastras (the minor scriptures), and virtuous<br>conduct. And virtuous conduct is indicated by acquisition of knowledge,<br>pilgrimage to sacred places, truthfulness, forbearance, purity and<br>straight-forwardness. Virtuous men are always kind to all creatures, and<br>well-disposed towards regenerate men. They abstain from doing injury to<br>any creature, and are never rude in speech. Those good men who know well<br>the consequences of the fruition of their good and evil deeds, are<br>commended by virtuous men. Those who are just and good-natured, and<br>endowed with virtue, who wish well of all creatures, who are steadfast in<br>the path of virtue, and have conquered heaven, who are charitable,<br>unselfish and of unblemished character, who succour the afflicted, and<br>are learned and respected by all, who practise austerities, and are kind<br>to all creatures, are commended as such by the virtuous. Those who are<br>charitably disposed attain prosperity in this world, as also the regions<br>of bliss (hereafter). The virtuous man when solicited for assistance by<br>good men bestow alms on them by straining to the utmost, even to the<br>deprivation of the comforts of his wife and servants. Good men having an<br>eye to their own welfare, as also virtue and the ways of the world, act<br>in this way and thereby grow in virtue through endless ages. Good persons<br>possessing the virtues of truthfulness, abstention from doing injury to<br>any one, rectitude, abstention from evil towards any one, want of<br>haughtiness, modesty, resignation, self-restraint, absence of passion,<br>wisdom, patience, and kindness towards all creatures, and freedom from<br>malice and lust, are the witnesses of the world. These three are said to<br>constitute the perfect way of the virtuous, viz., a man must not do wrong<br>to any body, he must bestow alms, and must always be truthful. Those<br>high-souled good men of virtuous conduct, and settled convictions, who<br>are kind to all and are full of compassion, depart with contentment from<br>this world to the perfect way of virtue. Freedom from malice,<br>forbearance, peace of mind, contentment, pleasant speech, renunciation of<br>desire and anger, virtuous conduct and actions regulated according to the<br>ordinances of holy writ, constitute the perfect way of the virtuous. And<br>those who are constant in virtue follow these rules of virtuous conduct,<br>and having reached the pinnacle of knowledge, and discriminating between<br>the various phases of human conduct, which are either very virtuous or<br>the reverse, they escape from the great danger. Thus, O great Brahmana,<br>having introduced the subject of virtuous conduct, have I described to<br>thee all this, according to my own knowledge and to what I have heard on<br>the subject."
