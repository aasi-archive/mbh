                            Kotika said, "Excellent lady, who art thou that standest alone, leaning<br>on a branch of the Kadamva tree at this hermitage and looking grand like<br>a flame of fire blazing at night time, and fanned by the wind?<br>Exquisitely beautiful as thou art, how is it that thou feelest not any<br>fear in these forests? Methinks thou art a goddess, or a Yakshi, or a<br>Danavi, or an excellent Apsara, or the wife of a Daitya, or a daughter of<br>the Naga king, or a Rakshasi or the wife of Varuna, or of Yama, or of<br>Soma, or of Kuvera, who, having assumed a human form, wanderest in these<br>forests. Or, hast thou come from the mansions of Dhatri, or of Vidhatri,<br>or of Savitri, or of Vibhu, or of Sakra? Thou dost not ask us who we are,<br>nor do we know who protects thee here! Respectfully do we ask thee, good<br>lady, who is thy powerful father, and, O, do tell us truly the names of<br>thy husband, thy relatives, and thy race, and tell us also what thou dost<br>here. As for us, I am king Suratha's son whom people know by the name of<br>Kotika, and that man with eyes large as the petals of the lotus, sitting<br>on a chariot of gold, like the sacrificial fire on the altar, is the<br>warrior known by the name of Kshemankara, king of Trigarta. And behind<br>him is the famous son of the king of Pulinda, who is even now gazing on<br>thee. Armed with a mighty bow and endued with large eyes, and decorated<br>with floral wreaths, he always liveth on the breasts of mountains. The<br>dark and handsome young man, the scourge of his enemies, standing at the<br>edge of that tank, is the son of Suvala of the race of Ikshwaku. And if,<br>O excellent lady, thou hast ever heard the name of Jayadratha, the king<br>of Sauviras, even he is there at the head of six thousand chariots, with<br>horses and elephants and infantry, and followed by twelve Sauvira princes<br>as his standard-bearers, named Angaraka, Kunjara, Guptaka, Satrunjaya,<br>Srinjaya, Suprabiddha, Prabhankara, Bhramara, Ravi, Sura, Pratapa and<br>Kuhana, all mounted on chariots drawn by chestnut horses and every one of<br>them looking like the fire on the sacrificial altar. The brothers also of<br>the king, viz., the powerful Valahaka, Anika, Vidarana and others, are<br>among his followers. These strong-limbed and noble youths are the flowers<br>of the Sauvira chivalry. The king is journeying in the company of these<br>his friends, like Indra surrounded by the Maruts. O fine-haired lady, do<br>tell us that are unacquainted (with these matters), whose wife and whose<br>daughter thou art."
