                            Janamejaya said, "What was that secret which was not revealed to Karna by<br>the deity of warm rays? Of what kind also were those ear-rings and of<br>what sort was that coat of mail? Whence, too, was that mail and those<br>ear-rings? All this, O best of men. I wish to hear! O thou possessed of<br>the wealth of asceticism, do tell me all this!"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "I will, O monarch, tell thee that secret which was<br>not revealed by the deity possessed of the wealth of effulgence. I will<br>also describe unto thee those ear-rings and that coat of mail. Once on a<br>time, O king, there appeared before Kuntibhoja a Brahmana of fierce<br>energy and tall stature, bearing a beard and matted locks, and carrying a<br>staff in his hand. And, he was agreeable to the eye and of faultless<br>limbs, and seemed to blaze forth in splendour. And he was possessed of a<br>yellow-blue complexion like that of honey. And his speech was<br>mellifluous, and he was adorned with ascetic merit and a knowledge of the<br>Vedas. And that person of great ascetic merit, addressing king<br>Kuntibhoja, said, 'O thou that are free from pride, I wish to live as a<br>guest in thy house feeding on the food obtained as alms from thee!<br>Neither thy followers, nor thou thyself, shall ever act in such a way as<br>to produce my displeasure! If, O sinless one, it liketh thee, I would<br>then live in thy house thus! I shall leave thy abode when I wish, and<br>come back when I please. And, O king, no one shall offend me in respect<br>of my food or bed.'&#8212;Then Kuntibhoja spake unto him these words<br>cheerfully, 'Be it so, and more.' And he again said unto him, 'O thou of<br>great wisdom, I have an illustrious daughter named Pritha. And she<br>beareth an excellent character, is observant of vow, chaste, and of<br>subdued senses. And she shall attend on thee and minister unto thee with<br>reverence. And thou wilt be pleased with her disposition!' And having<br>said this to that Brahmana and duly paid him homage, the king went to his<br>daughter Pritha of large eyes, and spake thus unto her, 'O child, this<br>eminently pious Brahmana is desirous of dwelling in my house! I have<br>accepted his proposal, saying,&#8212;So be it, relying, O child, on thy<br>aptitude and skill in ministering unto Brahmanas. It, therefore, behoveth<br>thee to act in such a manner that my words may not be untrue. Do thou<br>give him with alacrity whatever this reverend Brahmana possessed of<br>ascetic merit and engaged in the study of the Vedas, may want. Let<br>everything that this Brahmana asketh for be giver to him cheerfully. A<br>Brahmana is the embodiment of pre-eminent energy: he is also the<br>embodiment of the highest ascetic merit. It is in consequence of the<br>virtuous practices of Brahmanas that the sun shineth in the heavens. It<br>was for their disregard of Brahmanas that were deserving of honour that<br>the mighty Asura Vatapi, as also Talajangha, was destroyed by the curse<br>of the Brahmanas. For the present, O child, it is a highly virtuous one<br>of that order that is entrusted to thy keep. Thou shouldst always tend<br>this Brahmana with concentrated mind. O daughter, I know that, from<br>childhood upwards, thou hast ever been attentive to Brahmanas, and<br>superiors, and relatives, and servants, and friends, to thy mothers and<br>myself. I know thou bearest thyself well, bestowing proper regard upon<br>everyone. And, O thou of faultless limbs, in the city of the interior of<br>my palace, on account of thy gentle behaviour, there is not one, even<br>among the servants, that is dissatisfied with thee. I have, therefore,<br>thought thee fit to wait upon all Brahmanas of wrathful temper. Thou art,<br>O Pritha, a girl and has been adopted as my daughter. Thou art born in<br>the race of the Vrishnis, and art the favourite daughter of Sura. Thou<br>wert, O girl, given to me gladly by thy father himself. The sister of<br>Vasudeva by birth, thou art (by adoption) the foremost of my children.<br>Having promised me in these words,&#8212;I will give my first born,&#8212;thy<br>father gladly gave thee to me while thou wert yet in thy infancy. It is<br>for this reason that thou art my daughter. Born in such a race and reared<br>in such a race, thou hast come from one happy state to another like a<br>lotus transferred from one lake to another. O auspicious girl, women,<br>specially they that are of mean extraction, although they may with<br>difficulty be kept under restraint, become in consequence of their unripe<br>age, generally deformed in character. But thou, O Pritha, art born in a<br>royal race, and thy beauty also is extraordinary. And then, O girl, thou<br>art endued with every accomplishment. Do thou, therefore, O damsel,<br>renouncing pride and haughtiness and a sense of self-importance, wait<br>upon and worship the boon-giving Brahmana, and thereby attain, O Pritha,<br>to an auspicious state! By acting thus, O auspicious and sinless girl,<br>thou wilt surely attain to auspiciousness! But if on the contrary, thou<br>stirest up the anger of this best of the twice-born ones, my entire race<br>will be consumed by him!'"
