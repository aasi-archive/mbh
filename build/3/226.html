                            "Markandeya continued, The planets with their satellites, the Rishis and<br>the Mothers, Agni and numerous other blazing courtiers and many other<br>dwellers of heaven of terrible mien, waited on Mahasena along with the<br>Mothers. And the illustrious sovereign of the gods, desirous of victory<br>but believing success to be doubtful mounted his elephant Airavata and<br>attended by the other gods advanced towards Skanda. That mighty being<br>followed by all the celestials was armed with his thunderbolt. And with<br>the object of slaying Mahasena, he marched with terrible celestial army<br>of great-splendour, sounding their shrill war-cry and furnished with<br>various sorts of standards, with warriors encased in various armour and<br>armed with numerous bows and riding on various animals. When Mahasena<br>beheld the gloriously decked Sakra, attired in his best clothes,<br>advancing with the determination of slaying him, he (too on his part)<br>advanced to meet that chief of the celestials. O Partha, the mighty<br>Vasava, the lord of the celestials, then uttered a loud shout, to<br>encourage his warriors and marching rapidly with the view of killing<br>'Agnis' son and praised by Tridasas[75] and great Rishis, he at length<br>reached the abode of Kartikeya. And then he shouted out with other gods;<br>and Guha too in response to this, uttered a fearful war-cry resembling<br>the roaring of the sea. On hearing that noise, the celestial army behaved<br>like an agitated sea, and was stunned and fixed to the spot. And that son<br>of Pavaka (the Fire-god) beholding the gods come near to him with the<br>object of killing him, was filled with wrath, and gave out rising flame<br>of fire from within his mouth. And these flames destroyed the celestial<br>forces struggling on the ground. Their heads, their bodies, their arms<br>and riding animals were all burnt in that conflagration and they appeared<br>all on a sudden like stars displaced from their proper spheres. Thus<br>afflicted, the god renounced all allegiance to the thunder bolt, and<br>sought the protection of Pavaka's son; and thus peace was again secured.<br>When he was thus forsaken by the gods, Sakra hurled his thunder-bolt at<br>Skanda. It pierced him on the right side; and, O great king, it passed<br>through the body of that high-souled being. And from being struck with<br>the thunder-bolt, there arose from Skanda's body another being&#8212;a youth<br>with a club in hand, and adorned with a celestial amulet. And because he<br>was born on account of the piercing of the thunder-bolt, he was named<br>Visakha. And Indra, when he beheld that another person looking like the<br>fierce destroying Fire-god had come into being was frightened out of his<br>wits and besought the protection of Skanda, with the palms of his hands<br>joined together (as a mark of respect). And that excellent being Skanda,<br>bade him renounce all fear, with his arm. The gods were then transported<br>with joy, and their hands too struck up."
