                            Janamejaya said, "When the high-souled sons of Pritha were living in the<br>forest, what did those foremost of men and mighty archers&#8212;the sons of<br>Dhritarashtra&#8212;do? And what did the offspring of the Sun, Karna, and the<br>mighty Sakuni, and Bhishma, and Drona, and Kripa do? It behoveth thee to<br>relate this unto me."<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "When, O mighty king, in this manner the Pandavas had<br>gone, leaving Suyodhana, and when, having been liberated by Pandu's sons,<br>he had come to Hastinapura, Bhishma said these words to the son of<br>Dhritarashtra, 'O child, I had told thee before, when thou wert intent<br>upon going to the hermitage that thy journey did not please me. But thou<br>didst do so. And as a consequence, O hero, wert thou forcibly taken<br>captive by the enemy, and wert delivered by the Pandavas versed in<br>morality. Yet art thou not ashamed. Even in the presence of thee, O son<br>of Gandhari, together with thy army, did the Suta's son, struck with<br>panic, fly from the battle of the Gandharvas, O king. And, O foremost of<br>kings, O son of the monarch! while thou with thy army wert crying<br>distressfully, thou didst witness the prowess of the high-souled<br>Pandavas, and also, O mighty-armed one, of the wicked son of the Suta,<br>Karna. O best of kings, whether in the science of arms, or heroism, or<br>morality, Karna, O thou devoted to virtue, is not a fourth part of the<br>Pandavas. Therefore, for the welfare of this race, the conclusion of<br>peace is, I think, desirable with the high-souled Pandavas."<br><br>'Having been thus addressed by Bhishma, Dhritarashtra's son the king,<br>laughed a good deal, and then suddenly sailed out with the son of Suvala.<br>thereupon, knowing that he was gone, those mighty bowmen with Karna, and<br>Dussasana at their head, followed the highly powerful son of<br>Dhritarashtra. And seeing them gone, Bhishma, the grandfather of the<br>Kurus, hung down his head from shame, and then, O king, went to his own<br>quarters. And, O mighty monarch, when Bhishma had left, that lord of men,<br>Dhritarashtra's son came there again, and began to consult with his<br>counsellors, 'What is it that is good for me? What remaineth to be done?<br>And how we can most effectively bring about the good we shall discuss<br>to-day.' Karna said, 'O Kuru's son, Duryodhana, do thou lay to heart tie<br>words that I say. Bhishma always blameth us, and praiseth the Pandavas.<br>And from the ill-will he beareth towards thee, he hateth me also. And, O<br>lord of men, in thy presence he ever crieth me down. I shall never, O<br>Bharata, bear these words that Bhishma had said in thy presence in<br>relation to this matter, extolling the Pandavas, and censuring thee, O<br>represser of foes! Do thou, O king, enjoin on me, together with servants,<br>forces, and cars. I shall, O monarch, conquer the earth furnished with<br>mountains and woods and forests. The earth had been conquered by the four<br>powerful Pandavas. I shall, without doubt, conquer it for thee<br>single-handed. Let that wretch of the Kuru race, the exceedingly<br>wicked-minded Bhishma, see it,&#8212;he who vilifies those that do not deserve<br>censure, and praises those that should not be praised. Let him this day<br>witness my might, and blame himself. Do thou, O king, command me. Victory<br>shall surely be thine. By my weapon, O monarch, I swear this before thee.'<br><br>"O king, O bull of the Bharata race, hearing those words of Karna, that<br>lord of men, experiencing the highest delight, spoke unto Karna, saying,<br>'I am blessed. I have been favoured by thee,&#8212;since thou, endued with<br>great strength, art ever intent on my welfare. My life hath borne fruit,<br>to-day. As thou, O hero, intendest to subdue all our enemies, repair<br>thou. May good betide thee! Do thou command me (what I am to do),' O<br>subduer of foes, having been thus addressed by Dhritarashtra's<br>intelligent son, Karna ordered all the necessaries for the excursion. And<br>on an auspicious lunar day, at an auspicious moment, and under the<br>influence of a star presided over by an auspicious deity, that mighty<br>bowman, having been honoured by twice-born ones, and been bathed with<br>auspicious and holy substances and also worshipped by speech set out,<br>filling with the rattle of his car the three worlds, with their mobile<br>and immobile objects."
