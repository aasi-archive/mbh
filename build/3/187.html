                            "Then the virtuous king Yudhishthira in all humility again enquired of<br>the illustrious Markandeya, saying, 'O great Muni, thou hast seen many<br>thousands of ages pass away. In this world there is none so longlived as<br>thou! O best of those that have attained the knowledge of Supreme Spirit,<br>there is none equal to thee in years except the great-minded Brahma<br>living in the most exalted place. Thou, O Brahmana, worshippest Brahma at<br>the time of the great dissolution of the universe, when this world is<br>without sky and without the gods and Danavas. And when that cataclysm<br>ceaseth and the Grandsire awaketh, thou alone, O regenerate Rishi,<br>beholdest Brahma duly re-create the four orders of beings after having<br>filled the cardinal points with air and consigned the waters to their<br>proper place. Thou, O great Brahmana, hast worshipped in his presence the<br>great Lord and Grandsire of all creatures with soul rapt in meditation<br>and entirely swallowed up in Him! And, O Brahmana, thou hast many a time<br>witnessed with thy eyes, the primeval acts of creation, and, plunged in<br>severe ascetic austerities, thou hast also surpassed the Prajapatis<br>themselves! Thou art esteemed as one who is nearest to Narayana, in the<br>next world. Many a time in days of yore hast thou beheld the Supreme<br>Creator of the universe with eyes of spiritual abstraction and<br>renunciation, having first opened thy pure and lotus-like heart&#8212;the only<br>place where the multiform Vishnu of universal knowledge may be seen! It<br>is for this, O learned Rishi, by the grace of God neither all-destroying<br>Death, nor dotage that causeth the decay of the body, hath any power over<br>thee! When neither the sun, nor the moon, nor fire, nor earth, nor air,<br>nor sky remains, when all the world being destroyed looketh like one vast<br>ocean, when the Gods and Asuras and the great Uragas are annihilated, and<br>when the great-minded Brahma, the Lord of all creatures, taking his seat<br>on a lotus flower, sleepeth there, then thou alone remainest to worship<br>him! And, O best of Brahman as thou hast seen all this that occurred<br>before, with thy own eyes. And thou alone hast witnessed many things by<br>the senses, and never in all the worlds hath there been any thing unknown<br>to thee! Therefore do I long to hear any discourse explaining the causes<br>of things!"<br><br>"Markandeya replied, 'Indeed, I shall explain all, after having bowed<br>down to that Self-existent, Primordial Being, who is eternal and<br>undeteriorating and inconceivable, and who is at once vested with and<br>divested of attributes. O tiger among men, this Janardana attired in<br>yellow robes is the grand Mover and Creator of all, the Soul and Framer<br>of all things, and the lord of all! He is also called the Great, the<br>Incomprehensible, the Wonderful and the Immaculate. He is without<br>beginning and without end, pervades all the world, is Unchangeable and<br>Undeteriorating. He is the Creator of all, but is himself uncreate and is<br>the Cause of all power. His knowledge is greater than that of all the<br>gods together. O best of kings and pre-eminent of men, after the<br>dissolution of the universe, all this wonderful creation again comes into<br>life. Four thousand years have been said to constitute the Krita Yuga.<br>Its dawn also, as well as its eve, hath been said to comprise four<br>hundred years. The Treta-Yuga is said to comprise three thousand years,<br>and its dawn, as well as its eve, is said to comprise three hundred<br>years. The Yuga that comes next is called Dwapara, and it hath been<br>computed to consist of two thousand years. Its dawn, as well as its eve,<br>is said to comprise two hundred years. The next Yuga, called Kali, is<br>said to comprise one thousand years and its dawn, as well as eve, is said<br>to comprise one hundred years. Know, O king, that the duration of the<br>dawn is the same as that of the eve of a Yuga. And after the Kali Yuga is<br>over, the Krita Yuga comes again. A cycle of the Yugas thus comprised a<br>period of twelve thousand years. A full thousand of such cycles would<br>constitute a day of Brahma. O tiger among men, when all this universe is<br>withdrawn and ensconced within its home&#8212;the Creator himself&#8212;that<br>disappearance of all things is called by the learned to be Universal<br>Destruction. O bull of the Bharata race, towards the end of the last<br>mentioned period of one thousand years, i.e., when the period wanted to<br>complete a cycle is short, men generally become addicted to falsehood in<br>speech. O son of Pritha, then sacrifices and gifts and vows, instead of<br>being performed by principals are suffered to be performed by<br>representatives! Brahmanas then perform acts that are reserved for the<br>Sudras, and the Sudras betake themselves to the acquisition of wealth.<br>Then Kshatriyas also betake themselves to the practice of religious acts.<br>In the Kali age, the Brahmanas also abstain from sacrifices and the study<br>of the Vedas, are divested of their staff and deer-skin, and in respect<br>of food become omnivorous. And, O son, the Brahmanas in that age also<br>abstain from prayers and meditation while the Sudras betake themselves to<br>these! The course of the world looketh contrary, and indeed, these are<br>the signs that foreshadow the Universal Destruction. And, O lord of men,<br>numerous Mleccha kings then rule over the earth! And those sinful<br>monarchs, addicted to false speech, govern their subjects on principles<br>that are false. The Andhhas, the Sakas, the Pulindas, the Yavanas, the<br>Kamvojas, the Valhikas and the Abhiras, then become, O best of men,<br>possessed of bravery and the sovereignty of the earth. This, O tiger<br>among men, becometh the state of the world during the eve, O Bharata, of<br>the Kali age! Not a single Brahmana then adhereth to the duties of his<br>order. And the Kshatriyas and the Vaisyas also, O monarch, follow<br>practices contrary to those that are proper for their own orders. And men<br>become short-lived, weak in strength, energy, and prowess; and endued<br>with small might and diminutive bodies, they become scarcely truthful in<br>speech. And the human population dwindles away over large tracts of<br>country, and the regions of the earth, North and South, and East and<br>West, become crowded with animals and beasts of prey. And during this<br>period, they also that utter Brahma, do so in vain. The Sudras address<br>Brahmanas, saying, Bho, while the Brahmanas address Sudras, saying<br>Respected Sir. And, O tiger among men, at the end of the Yuga, animals<br>increase enormously. And, O king, odours and perfumes do not then become<br>so agreeable to our sense of scent, and, O tiger among men, the very<br>tastes of things do not then so well accord with our organs of taste as<br>at other periods! And, O king, women then become mothers of numerous<br>progeny, endued with low statures, and destitute of good behaviour and<br>good manners. And they also make their very mouths serve the purposes of<br>the organ of procreation. And famine ravages the habitations of men, and<br>the highways are infested by women of ill fame, while females in general,<br>O king, become at such periods hostile to their lords and destitute of<br>modesty! And, O king, the very kine at such periods yield little milk,<br>while the trees, sat over with swarms of crows, do not produce many<br>flowers and fruits. And, O lord of the earth, regenerate classes, tainted<br>with the sin of slaying Brahmanas, accept gifts from monarchs that are<br>addicted to falsehood in speech. And filled with covetousness and<br>ignorance, and bearing on their persons the outward symbols of religion,<br>they set out on eleemosynary rounds, afflicting the people of the Earth.<br>And people leading domestic lives, afraid of the burden of taxes, become<br>deceivers, while Brahmanas, falsely assuming the garb of ascetics, earn<br>wealth by trade, with nails and hair unpared and uncut. And, O tiger<br>among men, many of the twice-born classes become, from avarice of wealth,<br>religious mendicants of the Brahmacharin order. And, O monarch, men at<br>such periods behave contrary to the modes of life to which they betake<br>themselves, and addicted to intoxicating drinks and capable of violating<br>the beds of their preceptors, their desires are all of this world,<br>pursuing matters ministering to the flesh and the blood. And O tiger<br>among men, at such period the asylums of ascetics become full of sinful<br>and audacious wretches ever applauding lives of dependence. And the<br>illustrious chastiser of Paka never showers rain according to the seasons<br>and the seeds also that are scattered on earth, do not, O Bharata, all<br>sprout forth. And men, unholy in deed and thought, take pleasure in envy<br>and malice. And, O sinless one, the earth then becometh full of sin and<br>immorality. And, O lord of the earth, he that becometh virtuous at such<br>periods doth not live long. Indeed, the earth becometh reft of virtue in<br>every shape. And, O tiger among men, the merchants and traders then full<br>of guile, sell large quantities of articles with false weights and<br>measures. And they that are virtuous do not prosper; while they that are<br>sinful proper exceedingly. And virtue loseth her strength while sin<br>becometh all powerful. And men that are devoted to virtue become poor and<br>short-lived; while they that are sinful become long-lived and win<br>prosperity. And in such times, people behave sinfully even in places of<br>public amusements in cities and towns. And men always seek the<br>accomplishment of their ends by means that are sinful. And having earned<br>fortunes that are really small they become intoxicated with the pride of<br>wealth. And O monarch, many men at such periods strive to rob the wealth<br>that hath from trust been deposited with them in secrecy. And wedded to<br>sinful practices, they shamelessly declare&#8212;there is nothing in deposit.<br>And beasts of prey and other animals and fowl may be seen to lie down in<br>places of public amusement in cities and towns, as well as in sacred<br>edifices. And, O king girls of seven or eight years of age do then<br>conceive, while boys of ten or twelve years beget offspring. An in their<br>sixteenth year, men are overtaken with decrepitude and decay and the<br>period of life itself is soon outrun. And O king, when men become so<br>short-lived, more youths act like the aged; while all that is observable<br>in youth may be noticed in the old. And women given to impropriety of<br>conduct and marked by evil manners, deceive even the best of husbands and<br>forget themselves with menials and slaves and even with animals. And O<br>king, even women that are wives of heroes seek the companionship of other<br>men and forget themselves with these during the life-time of their<br>husbands.<br><br>"O king, towards the end of those thousands of years constituting the<br>four Yugas and when the lives of men become so short, a drought occurs<br>extending for many years. And then, O lord of the earth, men and<br>creatures endued with small strength and vitality, becoming hungry die by<br>thousands. And then, O lord of men, seven blazing Suns, appearing in the<br>firmament, drink up all the waters of the Earth that are in rivers or<br>seas. And, O bull of the Bharata race, then also everything of the nature<br>of wood and grass that is wet to dry, is consumed and reduced to ashes.<br>And then, O Bharata, the fire called Samvartaka impelled by the winds<br>appeareth on the earth that hath already been dried to cinders by the<br>seven Suns. And then that fire, penetrating through the Earth and making<br>its appearance, in the nether regions also, begetteth great terror in the<br>hearts of the gods, the Danavas and the Yakshas. And, O lord of the<br>earth, consuming the nether regions as also everything upon this Earth<br>that fire destroyeth all things in a moment. And that fire called<br>Samvartaka aided by that inauspicious wind, consumeth this world<br>extending for hundreds and thousands of yojanas. And that lord of all<br>things, that fire, blazing forth in effulgence consumeth this universe<br>with gods and Asuras and Gandharvas and Yakshas and Snakes and Rakshasas.<br>And there rise in the sky deep masses of clouds, looking like herds of<br>elephants and decked with wreaths of lightning that are wonderful to<br>behold. And some of those clouds are of the hue of the blue lotus; and<br>some are of the hue of the water-lily; and some resemble in tint the<br>filaments of the lotus and some are purple and some are yellow as<br>turmeric and some of the hue of the crows' egg. And some are bright as<br>the petals of the lotus and some red as vermillion. And some resemble<br>palatial cities in shape and some herds of elephants. And some are of the<br>form of lizards and some of crocodiles and sharks. And, O king, the<br>clouds that gather in the sky on the occasion are terrible to behold and<br>wreathed with lightnings, roar frightfully. And those vapoury masses,<br>charged with rain, soon cover the entire welkin. And, O king, those<br>masses of vapour then flood with water the whole earth with her mountains<br>and forests and mines. And, O bull among men, urged by the Supreme Lord<br>those clouds roaring frightfully, soon flood over the entire surface of<br>the earth. And pouring in a great quantity of water and filling the whole<br>earth, they quench that terrible inauspicious fire (of which I have<br>already spoken to thee). And urged by the illustrious Lord those clouds<br>filling the earth with their downpour shower incessantly for twelve<br>years. And then, O Bharata, the Ocean oversteps his continents, the<br>mountains sunder in fragments, and the Earth sinks under the increasing<br>flood. And then moved on a sudden by the impetus of the wind, those<br>clouds wander along the entire expanse of the firmament and disappear<br>from the view. And then, O ruler of men, the Self-create Lord&#8212;the first<br>Cause of everything&#8212;having his abode in the lotus, drinketh those<br>terrible winds and goeth to sleep, O Bharata!<br><br>"And then when the universe become one dead expanse of water, when all<br>mobile and immobile creatures have been destroyed, when the gods and the<br>Asuras cease to be, when the Yakshas and the Rakshasas are no more, when<br>man is not, when trees and beasts of prey have disappeared, when the<br>firmament itself has ceased to exist, I alone, O lord of the earth,<br>wander in affliction. And, O best of kings, wandering over that dreadful<br>expanse of water, my heart becometh afflicted in consequence of my not<br>beholding any creature! And, O king, wandering without cessation, through<br>that flood, I become fatigued, but I obtain no resting place! And some<br>time after I behold in that expanse of accumulated waters a vast and<br>wide-extending banian tree, O lord of earth! And I then behold, O<br>Bharata, seated on a conch, O king, overlaid with a celestial bed and<br>attached to a far-extended bough of that banian, a boy, O great king, of<br>face fair as the lotus or the moon, and of eyes, O ruler of men, large as<br>petals of a full blown lotus! And at this sight, O lord of earth, wonder<br>filled my heart. And I asked myself, 'How doth this boy alone sit here<br>when the world itself hath been destroyed?' And, O king, although I have<br>full knowledge of the Past, the Present, and the Future, still I failed<br>to learn anything of this by means of even ascetic meditation. Endued<br>with the lustre of the Atasi flower, and decked with the mark of<br>Sreevatsa, he seemed to me to be like the abode of Lakshmi, herself. And<br>that boy, of eyes like the petals of the lotus, having the mark of<br>Sreevatsa, and possessed of blazing effulgence, then addressed me in<br>words highly pleasant to the ear, saying, 'O sire, I know thee to be<br>fatigued and desirous of rest. O Markandeya of Bhrigu's race, rest thou<br>here as long as thou wishest. O best of Munis, entering within my body,<br>rest thou there. That hath been the abode assigned to thee by me. I have<br>been pleased with thee.' Thus addressed by that boy, a sense of total<br>disregard possessed me in respect both of my long life and state of<br>manhood. Then that boy suddenly opened his mouth, and as fate would have<br>it, I entered his mouth deprived of the power of motion. But O king,<br>having suddenly entered into the stomach of that boy, I behold there the<br>whole earth teeming with cities and kingdoms. And, O best of men, while<br>wandering through the stomach of that illustrious one, I behold the<br>Ganga, the Satudru, the Sita, the Yamuna, and the Kausiki; the<br>Charmanwati, the Vetravati; the Chandrabhaga, the Saraswati, the Sindhu,<br>the Vipasa, and the Godavari; the Vaswokasara, the Nalini and the<br>Narmada; the Tamra, and the Venna also of delightful current and sacred<br>waters; the Suvenna, the Krishna-venna, the Irama, and the Mahanadi; the<br>Vitasti, O great king, and that large river, the Cavery; the one also, O<br>tiger among men, the Visalya, and the Kimpuna also. I beheld all these<br>and many other rivers that are on the earth! And, O slayer of foes, I<br>also beheld there the ocean inhabited by alligators and sharks, that mine<br>of gems, that excellent abode of waters. And I beheld there the firmament<br>also, decked with the Sun and the Moon, blazing with effulgence, and<br>possessed of lustre of fire of the Sun. And I beheld there, O king, the<br>earth also, graced with woods and forests. And, O monarch, I beheld there<br>many Brahmanas also, engaged in various sacrifices; and the Kshatriyas<br>engaged in doing good to all the orders; and the Vaisyas employed in<br>pursuits in agriculture; and the Sudras devoted to the service of the<br>regenerate classes. And, O king, while wandering through the stomach of<br>that high-souled one, I also beheld the Himavat and the mountains of<br>Hemakuta. And I also saw Nishada, and the mountains of Sweta abounding in<br>silver. And, O king, I saw there the mountain Gandhamadana, and, O tiger<br>among men, also Mandara and the huge mountains of Nila. And, O great<br>king, I saw there the golden mountains of Meru and also Mahendra and<br>those excellent mountains called the Vindhyas. And I beheld there the<br>mountains of Malaya and of Paripatra also. These and many other mountains<br>that are on earth were all seen by me in his stomach. And all these were<br>decked with jewels and gems. And, O monarch, while wandering through his<br>stomach, I also beheld lions and tigers and boars and, indeed, all other<br>animals that are on earth, O great king! O tiger among men, having<br>entered his stomach, as I wandered around, I also beheld the whole tribe<br>of the gods with their chief Sakra, the Sadhyas, the Rudras, the Adityas,<br>the Guhyakas, the Pitris, the Snakes and the Nagas, the feathery tribes,<br>the Vasus, the Aswins, the Gandharvas, the Apsaras, the Yakshas, the<br>Rishis, the hordes of the Daityas and the Danavas, and the Nagas also. O<br>king, and the sons of Singhika and all the other enemies of the gods;<br>indeed what else of mobile and immobile creatures may be seen on earth,<br>were all seen by me, O monarch, within the stomach of that high-souled<br>one. And, O lord, living upon fruits I dwelt within his body for many<br>centuries wandering over the entire universe that is there. Never did I<br>yet, O king, behold the limits of his body. And when, O lord of earth, I<br>failed to measure the limits of that high-souled one's body, even though<br>I wandered within him continuously in great anxiety of mind. I then, in<br>thought and deed sought the protection of that boon-giving and<br>pre-eminent Deity, duly acknowledging his superiority. And when I had<br>done this, O king, I was suddenly projected (from within his body)<br>through that high-souled one's open mouth by means, O chief of men, of a<br>gust of wind. And, O king, I then beheld seated on the branch of that<br>very banian that same Being of immeasurable energy, in the form of a boy<br>with the mark of Sreevatsa (on his breast) having, O tiger among men,<br>swallowed up the whole universe. And that boy of blazing effulgence and<br>bearing the mark of Sreevatsa and attired in yellow robes, gratified with<br>me, smilingly addressed me, saying, 'O Markandeya, O best of Munis,<br>having dwelt for some time within my body, thou hast been fatigued! I<br>shall however speak unto thee.' And as he said this to me, at that very<br>moment I acquired a new sight, so to speak, in consequence of which I<br>beheld myself to be possessed of true knowledge and emancipated from the<br>illusions of the world. And, O child, having witnessed the inexhaustible<br>power of that Being of immeasurable energy, I then worshipped his revered<br>and well-shaped feet with soles bright as burnished copper and<br>well-decked with toes of mild red hue, having placed them carefully on my<br>head and joining my palms in humility and approaching him with reverence.<br>I beheld that Divine Being who is the soul of all things and whose eyes<br>are like the petals of the lotus. And having bowed unto him with joined<br>hands I addressed him saying, 'I wish to know thee, O Divine Being, as<br>also this high and wonderful illusion of thine! O illustrious one, having<br>entered into thy body through thy mouth, I have beheld the entire<br>universe in thy stomach! O Divine Being, the gods, the Danavas and the<br>Rakshasas, the Yakshas, the Gandharvas, and the Nagas, indeed, the whole<br>universe mobile and immobile, are all within thy body! And though I have<br>ceaselessly wandered through thy body at a quick pace, through thy grace,<br>O God, my memory faileth me not. And, O great lord, I have come out of<br>thy body at thy desire but not of mine! O thou of eyes like lotus leaves,<br>I desire to know thee who art free from all faults! Why dost thou stay<br>here in the form of a boy having swallowed up the entire universe? It<br>behoveth thee to explain all this to me. Why, O sinless one, is the<br>entire universe within thy body? How long also, O chastiser of foes, wilt<br>thou stay here? Urged by a curiosity that is not improper for Brahmanas,<br>I desire, O Lord of all the gods, to hear all this from thee, O thou of<br>eyes like lotus leaves, with every detail and exactly as it all happens,<br>for all I have seen, O Lord, is wonderful and inconceivable!' And thus<br>addressed by me, that deity of deities, of blazing effulgence and great<br>beauty, that foremost of all speakers consoling me properly, spoke unto<br>me these words."
