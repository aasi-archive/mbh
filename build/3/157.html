                            Vaisampayana continued, "On that Rakshasa having been slain, that lord,<br>the royal son of Kunti, returned to the hermitage of Narayana and began<br>to dwell there. And once on a time, remembering his brother Jaya<br>(Arjuna), Yudhishthira summoned all his brothers, together with Draupadi<br>and said these words, 'We have passed these four years peacefully ranging<br>the woods. It hath been appointed by Vibhatsu that about the fifth year<br>he will come to that monarch of mountains, the excellent cliff Sweta,<br>ever graced with festivities held by blooming plants and maddened Kokilas<br>and black bees, and peacocks, and chatakas and inhabited by tigers, and<br>boars and buffaloes, and gavayas, and deer, and ferocious beasts; and<br>sacred; and lovely with blown lotuses of a hundred and a thousand petals,<br>and blooming lilies and blue lilies and frequented by the celestials and<br>the Asuras. And we also, eagerly anxious of meeting him on his arrival<br>have made up our minds to repair thither. Partha of unrivalled prowess<br>hath appointed with me, saying, 'I shall remain abroad for five years,<br>with the object of learning military science.' In the place like unto the<br>region of the gods, shall we behold the wielder of Gandiva, arrive after<br>having obtained the weapons.' Having said this, the Pandava summoned the<br>Brahmanas, and the sons of Pritha having gone round the ascetics of rigid<br>austerities and thereby pleased them, informed them of the matter<br>mentioned above. Thereupon the Brahmanas gave their assent, saying, 'This<br>shall be attended by prosperity and welfare. O foremost of the Bharatas,<br>these troubles shall result in happiness. O pious one, gaining the earth<br>by the Kshatriya virtue, thou shall govern it.' Then in obedience to<br>these words of the ascetics, that represser of foes, Yudhishthira, set<br>out with his brothers and those Brahmanas, followed by the Rakshasa and<br>protected by Lomasa. And that one of mighty energy, and of staunch vows,<br>with his brothers, at places went on foot and at others were carried by<br>the Rakshasas. Then king Yudhishthira, apprehending many troubles,<br>proceeded towards the north abounding in lions and tigers and elephants.<br>And beholding on the way the mountain Mainaka and the base of the<br>Gandhamadana and that rocky mass Sweta and many a crystal rivulet higher<br>and higher up the mountain, he reached on the seventeenth day the sacred<br>slopes of the Himalayas. And, O king, not far from the Gandhamadana,<br>Pandu's son beheld on the sacred slopes of the Himavan covered with<br>various trees and creepers the holy hermitage of Vrishaparva surrounded<br>by blossoming trees growing near the cascades. And when those repressers<br>of foes, the sons of Pandu, had recovered from fatigue, they went to the<br>royal sage, the pious Vrishaparva and greeted him. And that royal sage<br>received with affection those foremost of Bharatas, even as his own sons.<br>And those repressers of foes passed there seven nights, duly regarded.<br>And when the eighth day came, taking the permission of that sage<br>celebrated over the worlds, they prepared to start on their journey. And<br>having one by one introduced unto Vrishaparva those Brahmanas, who, duly<br>honoured, remained in his charge as friends; and having also entrusted<br>the highsouled Vrishaparva with their remaining robes, the sons of Pandu,<br>O king, left in the hermitage of Vrishaparva their sacrificial vessels<br>together with their ornaments and jewels. And wise and pious and versed<br>in every duty and having a knowledge of the past as well as the future,<br>that one gave instructions unto those best of the Bharatas, as unto his<br>own sons. Then taking his permission those high-souled ones set out<br>towards the north. And as they set out the magnanimous Vrishaparva<br>followed them to a certain distance. Then having entrusted the Pandavas<br>unto the care of the Brahmanas and instructed and blessed them and given<br>directions concerning their course, Vrishaparva of mighty energy retraced<br>his steps.<br><br>"Then Kunti's son, Yudhishthira of unfailing prowess, together with his<br>brothers, began to proceed on foot along the mountain path, inhabited by<br>various kinds of beasts. And having dwelt at the mountain slopes, densely<br>overgrown with trees, Pandu's son on the fourth day reached the Sweta<br>mountain, like unto a mighty mass of clouds, abounding in streams and<br>consisting of a mass of gold and gems. And taking the way directed by<br>Vrishaparva, they reached one by one the intended places, beholding<br>various mountains. And over and over they passed with ease many<br>inaccessible rocks and exceedingly impassable caves of the mountain. And<br>Dhaumya and Krishna and the Parthas and the mighty sage Lomasa went on in<br>a body and none grew tired. And those highly fortunate ones arrived at<br>the sacred and mighty mountain resounding with the cries of birds and<br>beasts and covered with various trees and creepers and inhabited by<br>monkeys, and romantic and furnished with many lotus-lakes and having<br>marshes and extensive forests. And then with their down standing erect,<br>they saw the mountain Gandhamadana, the abode of Kimpurushas, frequented<br>by Siddhas and Charanas and ranged by Vidyadharis and Kinnaris and<br>inhabited by herds of elephants and thronged with lions and tigers and<br>resounding with the roars of Sarabhas and attended by various beasts. And<br>the war-like sons of Pandu gradually entered into the forest of the<br>Gandhamadana, like unto the Nandana gardens, delightful to the mind and<br>heart and worthy of being inhabited and having beautiful groves. And as<br>those heroes entered with Draupadi and the high-souled Brahmanas, they<br>heard notes uttered by the mouths of birds, exceedingly sweet and<br>graceful to the ear and causing delight and dulcet and broken by reason<br>of excess of animal spirits. And they saw various trees bending under the<br>weight of fruits in all seasons, and ever bright with flowers&#8212;such as<br>mangoes and hog-plums and bhavyas and pomegranates, citrons and jacks and<br>lakuchas and plantains and aquatic reeds and parvatas and champakas and<br>lovely kadamvas and vilwas, wood-apples and rose-apples and kasmaris and<br>jujbes and figs and glomerous figs and banians and aswatthas and khirikas<br>and bhall atakas and amalkas and bibhitakas and ingudas and karamardas<br>and tindukas of large fruits&#8212;these and many others on the slopes of the<br>Gandhamadana, clustered with sweet and nectarine fruits. And besides<br>these, they beheld champakas and asokas and ketakas and vakulas and<br>punnagas and saptaparnas and karnikaras, and patals, and beautiful<br>kutajas and mandaras, and lotuses, and parijatas, and kovidaras and<br>devadarus, and salas, and palmyra palms, and tamalas, and pippalas, and<br>salmalis and kinsukas, and singsapas, and saralas and these were<br>inhabited by Chakoras, and wood-peckers and chatakas, and various other<br>birds, singing in sweet tones pleasing to the ear. And they saw lakes<br>beautiful on all sides with aquatic birds, and covered all around with<br>kumudas, and pundarikas, and kokanadas, and utpalas, and kalharas, and<br>kamalas and thronged on all sides with drakes and ruddy geese, and<br>ospreys, and gulls and karandavas, and plavas, and swans, and cranes, and<br>shags, and other aquatic birds. And those foremost of men saw those<br>lotus-lakes beautified with assemblages of lotuses, and ringing with the<br>sweet hum of bees, glad, and drowsy on account of having drunk the<br>intoxicating honey of lotuses, and reddened with the farina falling from<br>the lotuscups. And in the groves they beheld with their hens peacocks<br>maddened with desire caused by the notes of cloud-trumpets; and those<br>woods-loving glad peacocks drowsy with desire, were dancing, spreading in<br>dalliance their gorgeous tails, and were crying in melodious notes. And<br>some of the peacocks were sporting with their mates on kutaja trees<br>covered with creepers. And some sat on the boughs of the kutajas,<br>spreading their gorgeous tails, and looking like crowns worn by the<br>trees. And in the glades they beheld the graceful sindhuvaras like unto<br>the darts of Cupid. And on the summits of the mountain, they saw blooming<br>karnikaras bearing blossoms of a golden hue, appearing like ear-rings of<br>excellent make. And in the forest they saw blossoming kuruvakas, like<br>unto the shafts of Cupid, which smiteth one with desire and maketh him<br>uneasy. And they saw tilakas appearing like unto beauty-spots painted on<br>the forehead of the forest. And they saw mango trees graced with blossoms<br>hummed over by black bees, and serving the purpose of Cupid's shafts. And<br>on the slopes of the mountain there were diverse blossoming trees,<br>looking lovely, some bearing flowers of a golden hue, and some, of the<br>hue of the forest-conflagration, and some, red and some sable, and some<br>green like unto lapises. And besides these, there were ranges of salas<br>and tamalas and patalas and vakula trees, like unto garlands put on by<br>the summits of mountain. Thus gradually beholding on the slopes of the<br>mountain many lakes, looking transparent like crystal, and having swans<br>of white plumage and resounding with cries of cranes, and filled with<br>lotuses and lilies, and furnished with waters of delicious feel; and also<br>beholding fragrant flowers, and luscious fruits, and romantic lakes, and<br>captivating trees, the Pandavas penetrated into the forest with eyes<br>expanded with wonder. And (as they proceeded) they were fanned by the<br>breeze of balmy feel, and perfumed by kamalas and utpalas and kalharas<br>and pundarikas. Then Yudhishthira pleasantly spake unto Bhima saying,<br>'Ah! O Bhima, beautiful is this forest of the Gandhamadana. In this<br>romantic forest there are various heavenly blossoming wild trees and<br>creepers, bedecked with foliage and fruit, nor are there any trees that<br>do not flower. On these slopes of the Gandhamadana, all the trees are of<br>sleek foliage and fruit. And behold how these lotus-lakes with fullblown<br>lotuses, and ringing with the hum of black bees, are being agitated by<br>elephants with their mates. Behold another lotus-lake girt with lines of<br>lotuses, like unto a second Sree in an embodied form wearing garlands.<br>And in this excellent forest there are beautiful ranges of woods, rich<br>with the aroma of various blossoms, and hummed over by the black bees.<br>And, O Bhima, behold on all sides the excellent sporting ground of the<br>celestials. By coming here, we have attained extra-human state, and been<br>blessed. O Partha, on these slopes of the Gandhamadana, yon beautiful<br>blossoming trees, being embraced by creepers with blossoms at their tops,<br>look lovely. And, O Bhima, hark unto the notes of the peacocks crying<br>with their hens on the mountain slopes. And birds such as chakoras, and<br>satapatras, and maddened kokilas, and parrots, are alighting on these<br>excellent flowering trees. And sitting on the twigs, myriads of<br>jivajivakas of scarlet, yellow and red hues, are looking at one another.<br>And the cranes are seen near the spots covered with green and reddish<br>grass, and also by the side of the cascades. And those birds,<br>bhringarajas, and upachakras, and herons are pouring forth their notes<br>charming to all creatures. And, lo! with their mates, these elephants<br>furnished with four tusks, and white as lotuses, are agitating that large<br>lake of the hue of lapises. And from many cascades, torrents high as<br>several palmyra palms (placed one upon another) are rushing down from the<br>cliffs. And many argent minerals splendid, and of the effulgence of the<br>sun, and like unto autumnal clouds, are beautifying this mighty mountain.<br>And in some places there are minerals of the hue of the collyrium, and in<br>some those like unto gold, in some, yellow orpiment and in some,<br>vermilion, and in some, caves of red arsenic like unto the evening clouds<br>and in some, red chalk of the hue of the rabit, and in some, minerals<br>like unto white and sable clouds; and in some, those effulgent as the<br>rising sun, these minerals of great lustre beautify the mountain. O<br>Partha, as was said by Vrishaparva, the Gandharvas and the Kimpurushas,<br>in company with their loves, are visible on the summits of the mountain.<br>And, O Bhima, there are heard various songs of appropriate measures, and<br>also Vedic hymns, charming to all creatures. Do thou behold the sacred<br>and graceful celestial river Mahaganga, with swans, resorted to by sages<br>and Kinnaras. And, O represser of foes, see this mountain having<br>minerals, rivulets, and beautiful woods and beasts, and snakes of diverse<br>shapes and a hundred heads and Kinnaras, Gandharvas and Apsaras.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Having attained excellent state, those valiant and<br>warlike repressers of foes with Draupadi and the high-souled Brahmanas<br>were exceedingly delighted at heart, and they were not satiated by<br>beholding that monarch of mountains. Thereafter they saw the hermitage of<br>the royal sage Arshtishena, furnished with flowers and trees bearing<br>fruits. Then they went to Arshtishena versed in all duties of rigid<br>austerities, skeleton-like, and having muscles bare."
