                            Vaisampayana said, "That bull among men&#8212;Dhritarashtra&#8212;the son of<br>Amvika, having heard of this wonderful way of life&#8212;so above that of<br>men&#8212;of the sons of Pandu, was filled with anxiety and grief. And<br>overwhelmed with melancholy and sighing heavily and hot, that monarch,<br>addressing his charioteer Sanjaya, said, 'O charioteer, a moment's peace<br>I have not, either during the day or the night, thinking of the terrible<br>misbehaviour of my sons arising out of their past gambling, and thinking<br>also of the heroism, the patience, the high intelligence, the unbearable<br>prowess, and the extraordinary love unto one another of the sons of<br>Pandu. Amongst the Pandavas, the illustrious Nakula and Sahadeva, of<br>celestial origin and equal unto the chief himself of the celestials in<br>splendour, are invincible in battle. They are firm in the wielding of<br>weapons, capable of shooting at a long distance, resolute in battle, of<br>remarkable lightness of hand, of wrath that is not easily quelled,<br>possessed of great steadiness, and endued with activity. Possessed of the<br>prowess of lions and unbearable as the Aswins themselves, when they will<br>come to the field of battle with Bhima and Arjuna in front, I see, O<br>Sanjaya, that my soldiers will all be slain without a remnant. Those<br>mighty warriors of celestial origin, unrivalled in battle by anybody,<br>filled with rage at the remembrance of that insult to Draupadi, will show<br>no forgiveness. The mighty warriors of the Vrishnis also, and the<br>Panchalas of great energy, and the sons of Pritha themselves, led by<br>Vasudeva of unbaffled prowess, will blast my legions. O charioteer, all<br>the warriors on my side assembled together, are not competent to bear the<br>impetus of the Vrishnis alone when commanded by Rama and Krishna. And<br>amongst them will move that great warrior Bhima of terrible prowess,<br>armed with his iron mace held on high and capable of slaying every hero.<br>And high above the din will be heard the twang of the Gandiva loud as the<br>thunder of heaven. The impetus of Bhima's mace and the loud twang of the<br>Gandiva are incapable of being stood against by any of the kings on my<br>side. It is then, O Sanjaya, that obedient as I have been to the voice of<br>Duryodhana, I shall have to call back the rejected counsels of my<br>friends&#8212;counsels that I should have attended to in time.'"<br><br>Sanjaya said, "This hath been thy great fault, O king, viz., that though<br>capable, thou didst not, from affection prevent thy son from doing what<br>he hath done. The slayer of Madhu, that hero of unfading glory, hearing<br>that the Pandavas had been defeated at dice, soon went to the woods of<br>Kamyaka and consoled them there. And Draupadi's sons also headed by<br>Dhrishtadyumna, and Virata, and Dhrishtaketu, and those mighty warriors,<br>the Kekayas, all went there. All that was said by these warriors at the<br>sight of Pandu's son defeated at dice, was learnt by me through our<br>spies. I have also told thee all, O king. When the slayer of Madhu met<br>the Pandavas, they requested him to become the charioteer of Phalguna in<br>battle. Hari himself, thus requested, answered them, saying, 'so be it.'<br>And even Krishna himself beholding the sons of Pritha dressed in deer<br>skins, became filled with rage, and addressing Yudhishthira, said, 'That<br>prosperity which the sons of Pritha had acquired at Indraprastha, and<br>which, unobtainable by other kings, was beheld by me at the Rajasuya<br>sacrifice, at which, besides, I saw all kings, even those of the Vangas<br>and Angas and Paundras and Odras and Cholas and Dravidas and Andhakas,<br>and the chiefs of many islands and countries on the sea-board as also of<br>frontier states, including the rulers of the Sinhalas, the barbarous<br>mlecchas, the natives of Lanka, and all the kings of the West by<br>hundreds, and all the chiefs of the sea-coast, and the kings of the<br>Pahlavas and the Daradas and the various tribes of the Kiratas and<br>Yavanas and Sakras and the Harahunas and Chinas and Tukharas and the<br>Sindhavas and the Jagudas and the Ramathas and the Mundas and the<br>inhabitants of the kingdom of women and the Tanganas and the Kekayas and<br>the Malavas and the inhabitants of Kasmira, afraid of the prowess of your<br>weapons, present in obedience to your invitation, performing various<br>offices,&#8212;that prosperity, O king, so unstable and waiting at present on<br>the foe, I shall restore to thee, depriving thy foe of his very life. I<br>shall, O chief of the Kurus, assisted by Rama and Bhima and Arjuna and<br>the twins and Akrura and Gada and Shamva and Pradyumna and Ahuka and the<br>heroic Dhrishtadyumna and the son of Sisupala, slay in battle in course<br>of a day Duryodhana and Karna and Dussasana and Suvala's son and all<br>others who may fight against us. And thou shalt, O Bharata, living at<br>Hastinapura along with thy brothers, and snatching from Dhritarashtra's<br>party the prosperity they are enjoying, rule this earth.' Even these, O<br>king, were Krishna's words unto Yudhishthira, who, on the conclusion of<br>Krishna's speech, addressed him in that meeting of heroes and in the<br>hearing of all those brave warriors headed by Dhrishtadyumna, saying, 'O<br>Janardana, I accept these words of thine as truth. O thou of mighty arms,<br>do thou, however, slay my enemies along with all their followers on the<br>expiry of thirteen years. O Kesava, promise this truly unto me. I<br>promised in the presence of the king to live in the forest as I am now<br>living.' Consenting to these words of king Yudhishthira the just, his<br>counsellors headed by Dhrishtadyumna soon pacified the incensed Kesava<br>with sweet words and expressions suitable to the occasion. And they also<br>said unto Draupadi of pure deeds in the hearing of Vasudeva himself,<br>these words, 'O lady, in consequence of thy anger, Duryodhana shall lay<br>down his life. We promise it, O thou of the fairest complexion.<br>Therefore, grieve no more. O Krishna, those that mocked thee, beholding<br>thee won at dice, shall reap the fruit of their act. Beasts of prey and<br>birds shall eat their flesh, and mock them thus. Jackals and vultures<br>will drink their blood. And, O Krishna, thou shalt behold the bodies of<br>those wretches that dragged thee by the hair prostrate on the earth,<br>dragged and eaten by carnivorous animals. They also that gave thee pain<br>and disregarded thee shall lie on the earth destitute of their heads, and<br>the earth herself shall drink their blood.' These and other speeches of<br>various kinds were uttered there, O king, by those bulls of the Bharata<br>race. All of them are endued with energy and bravery, and marked with the<br>marks of battle. On the expiration of the thirteenth year, those mighty<br>warriors, chosen by Yudhishthira and headed by Vasudeva, will come (to<br>the field of battle). Rama and Krishna and Dhananjaya and Pradyumna and<br>Shamva and Yuyudhana and Bhima and the sons of Madri and the Kekaya<br>princes and the Panchala princes, accompanied by the king of Matsya,<br>these all, illustrious and celebrated and invincible heroes, with their<br>followers and troops, will come. Who is there that, desiring to live,<br>will encounter these in battle, resembling angry lions of erect manes?'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, "What Vidura told me at the time of the game at<br>dice, 'If thou seekest, O king, to vanquish the Pandavas (at dice), then<br>certainly a terrible blood-shed ending in the destruction of all the<br>Kurus will be the result,' I think it is about to be realised. As Vidura<br>told me of old, without doubt a terrible battle will take place, as soon<br>as the pledged period of the Pandavas expireth.'"
