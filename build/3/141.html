                            "Lomasa said, O sons of Pandu, ye have seen many a mountain, and river<br>and town and forest and beautiful tirtha; and have touched with your<br>hands the sacred waters. Now this way leads to the celestial mountain<br>Mandara; therefore be ye attentive and composed. Ye will now repair to<br>the residence of the celestials and the divine sages of meritorious<br>deeds. Here, O king, flows the mighty and beautiful river (Alakananda) of<br>holy water adored by hosts of celestials and sages, and tracing its<br>source to (the site of) the jujube tree. It is frequented and worshipped<br>by high-souled Vaihayasas, Valakhilyas and Gandharvas of mighty souls.<br>Accustomed to sing the Sama hymns, the sages, Marichi, Pulaha, Bhrigu and<br>Angiras, chanted them at this spot. Here the lord of celestials<br>performeth with the Maruts his daily prayers. And the Sadhyas and the<br>Aswins attend on him. The sun, the moon and all the luminaries with the<br>planets resort to this river, alternately by day and by night. O highly<br>fortunate monarch, that protector of the world; Mahadeva, having a bull<br>for his mark, received on his head the fall of the waters of this river,<br>at the source of the Ganga. O children, approach this goddess of the six<br>attributes and bow down before her with concentrated minds.'<br><br>"Hearing the words of the high-souled Lomasa, the son of Pandu<br>reverentially worshipped the river (Ganga), flowing through the<br>firmament. And after having adored her the pious sons of Pandu resumed<br>their journey accompanied by the sages. And it came to pass that those<br>best of men beheld at a distance some white object of vast proportions,<br>even like Meru and stretching on all sides. And knowing that Pandu's sons<br>were intent upon asking (him), Lomasa versed in speech said, 'Hear, O<br>sons of Pandu! O best of men, what ye see before you, of vast proportions<br>like unto a mountain and beautiful as the Kailasa cliff, is a collection<br>of the bones of the mighty Daitya Naraka, Being placed on a mountain, it<br>looketh like one. The Daitya was slain by that Supreme Soul, the eternal<br>God Vishnu, for the good of the lord of celestials. Aiming at the<br>possession of Indra's place, by the force of austere and Vedic lore, that<br>mighty-minded (demon) had practised austere penances for ten thousand<br>years. And on account of his asceticism, as also of the force and might<br>of his arms he had grown invincible and always harassed (Indra). And O<br>sinless one, knowing his strength and austerities and observance of<br>religious vows, Indra became agitated and was overwhelmed with fear. And<br>mentally he thought of the eternal deity, Vishnu. And thereat the<br>graceful lord of the universe, who is present everywhere, appeared and<br>stood before him manifest. And the sages and celestials began to<br>propitiate Vishnu with prayers. And in his presence even Agni of the six<br>attributes and of blazing beauty being overpowered by his effulgence,<br>became shorn of radiance and seeing before him the God Vishnu, the chief<br>of the celestials who wields the thunder-bolt, bowing with head down<br>readily apprised Vishnu of the source of his fear. Thereupon Vishnu said,<br>'I know, O Sakra, that thy fear proceedeth from Naraka, that lord of the<br>Daityas. By the merit of his successful ascetic acts he aimeth at Indra's<br>position. Therefore, for pleasing thee, I shall certainly sever his soul<br>from his body, although he hath achieved success in asceticism. Do thou,<br>lord of celestials, wait for a moment.' Then the exceedingly powerful<br>Vishnu deprived (Naraka) of his senses (by striking him) with his hand.<br>And he fell down on the earth even like the monarch of mountains struck<br>by (thunder). He was thus slain by a miracle and his bones lie gathered<br>at this spot. Here also is manifest another deed of Vishnu's. Once the<br>whole earth having been lost and sunk into the nether regions she was<br>lifted up by him in the shape of a boar having a single tusk.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O worshipful one, relate in particular how Vishnu,<br>the lord of the celestials, raised up the earth sunk a hundred yojanas?<br>In what manner also was that support of all created things&#8212;the goddess<br>Earth of high fortune&#8212;who dispenseth blessings and bringeth forth all<br>sorts of corn rendered stable? Through whose power had she sunk an<br>hundred yojanas below, and under what circumstances was exhibited this<br>greatest exploit of the Supreme Being? O chief of the twice-born race, I<br>wish to hear all about it in detail as it happened. Certainly, it is<br>known to thee.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'O Yudhishthira, listen to all at length as I relate the<br>story, which thou hast asked me (to narrate). O child, in days of yore,<br>there was (once) a terrible time in the Krita Yuga when the eternal and<br>primeval Deity assumed the duties of Yama. And, O thou that never fallest<br>off, when the God of gods began to perform the functions of Yama, there<br>died not a creature while the births were as usual. Then there began to<br>multiply birds and beasts and kine, and sheep, and deer and all kinds of<br>carnivorous animals. O tiger among men and vanquisher of foes, then the<br>human race also increased by thousands even like unto a current of water.<br>And, O my son, when the increase of population had been so frightful, the<br>Earth oppressed with the excessive burden, sank down for a hundred<br>yojanas. And suffering pain in all her limbs, and being deprived of her<br>senses by excessive pressure, the earth in distress sought the protection<br>of Narayana, the foremost of the gods. The earth spake saying, 'It is by<br>thy favour, O possessor of the six attributes, that I had been able to<br>remain so long in my position. But I have been overcome with burden and<br>now I cannot hold myself any longer. It behoveth thee, O adorable one, to<br>relieve this load of mine. I have sought thy protection. O lord; and do<br>thou, therefore, extend unto me thy favour.' Hearing these words of hers,<br>the eternal lord, possessor of the six attributes, complaisantly said, in<br>words uttered in distinct letters. Vishnu said, 'Thou need not fear, O<br>afflicted Earth, the bearer of all treasures. I shall act so that thou<br>mayst be made light.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'Having thus dismissed the Earth, who hath the mountains<br>for her ear-rings, he suddenly became turned into a boar with one tusk,<br>and of exceeding effulgence. Causing terror with his glowing red eyes and<br>emitting fumes from his blazing lustre, he began to swell in magnitude in<br>that region. O hero, then holding the earth with his single radiant tusk<br>that being who pervadeth the Vedas, raised her up a hundred yojanas. And<br>while she was being thus raised, there ensued a mighty agitation and all<br>the celestials, together with the sages of ascetic wealth became<br>agitated. And heaven, and the firmament, and also the Earth were filled<br>with exclamations of Oh! and Alas! and neither the celestials nor men<br>could rest in peace. Then countless celestials together with the sages<br>went to Brahma, who was seated burning as it were in his (own) lustre.<br>Then approaching Brahma, the lord of celestials, and the witness of the<br>acts of all beings, they with folded hands spake the following words, 'O<br>lord of the celestials, all created beings have become agitated and the<br>mobile and immobile creatures are restless. O lord of the celestials,<br>even the oceans are found to be agitated and this whole earth hath gone<br>down a hundred yojanas. What is the matter? And by whose influence is it<br>that the whole universe is in ferment? May it please thee to explain it<br>unto us without delay, for we are all bewildered.' Thereupon Brahma<br>replied, 'Ye immortals! do ye not entertain fear for the Asuras, in any<br>matter or place. Hearken, ye celestials, to the reason to which all this<br>commotion is owing! This agitation in the heavens hath been produced by<br>the influence of the illustrious Being who is omnipresent, eternal and<br>the never-perishing Soul. That Supreme soul, Vishnu hath lifted up the<br>Earth, who had entirely sunk down hundred yojanas. This commotion hath<br>taken place in consequence of the earth being raised up. Know ye this and<br>dispel your doubts.' The celestials said, 'Where is that Being who with<br>pleasure raiseth up the Earth? O possessor of the six attributes, mention<br>unto us the place. Thither shall we repair.' Brahma said 'Go ye. May good<br>happen to you! Ye will find him resting in the Nandana (gardens). Yonder<br>is visible the glorious worshipful Suparna (Garuda). After having raised<br>the Earth, the Supreme Being from whom the world become manifest, flameth<br>even in the shape of a boar, like unto the all-consuming fire at the<br>universal dissolution. And on his beast is really to be seen the gem<br>Srivatsa. (Go) and behold that Being knowing no deterioration.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'Then the celestials, placing the grandsire at their head,<br>came to that infinite Soul, and having listened to his praise, bade him<br>adieu and went back to whence they had come.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "O Janamejaya, having heard this story, all the<br>Pandavas without delay and with alacrity, began to proceed by the way<br>pointed out by Lomasa."
