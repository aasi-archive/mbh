                            "Vrihadaswa continued, 'O Bharata, Nala pledged his word to the<br>celestials saying, 'I will do it.' And then approaching these, he asked<br>with folded hands. 'Who are ye? And who also is he that desireth me to be<br>his messenger? And what, further, shall I have to do for you? O tell me<br>truly!'&#8212;When the king of the Nishadhas spoke thus, Maghavat replied,<br>saying, 'Know us as the immortals come hither for Damayanti's sake. I am<br>Indra, this one is Agni, this the lord of waters, and this, O king, is<br>even Yama the destroyer of the bodies of men. Do thou inform Damayanti of<br>our arrival, saying, 'The guardians of the world, (consisting of) the<br>great Indra and the others, are coming to the assembly, desirous of<br>beholding (the Swayamvara). The gods, Sakra and Agni and Varuna and Yama,<br>desire to obtain thee. Do thou, therefore, choose one of them for thy<br>lord.' Thus addressed by Sakra, Nala said with joined hands, 'I have come<br>here with the self same object. It behoveth thee not to send me (on this<br>errand). How can a person who is himself under the influence of love<br>bring himself to speak thus unto a lady on behalf of others? Therefore,<br>spare me, ye gods' The gods, however, said, 'O ruler of the Nishadhas,<br>having promised first, saying, 'I will! why wilt thou not act accordingly<br>now? O ruler of the Nishadhas, tell us this without delay.'<br><br>"Vrihadaswa continued, 'Thus addressed by those celestials, the ruler of<br>Nishadhas spake again, saying, 'Those mansions are well-guarded. How can<br>I hope to enter them?' Indra replied, 'Thou shalt be able to enter.' And,<br>saying, So be it.' Nala thereupon went to the palace of Damayanti. And<br>having arrived there, he beheld the daughter of the king of Vidarbha<br>surrounded by her hand-maids, blazing in beauty and excelling in symmetry<br>of form, of limbs exceedingly delicate, of slender waist and fair eyes.<br>And she seemed to rebuke the light of the moon by her own splendour. And<br>as he gazed on that lady of sweet smiles. Nala's love increased, but<br>desirous of keeping his truth, he suppressed his passion. And at the<br>sight of Naishadha, overpowered by his effulgence, those first of women<br>sprang up from their seats in amazement. And filled with wonder (at his<br>sight), they praised Nala in gladness of heart. And without saying<br>anything, they mentally paid him homage, 'Oh, what comeliness! Oh, what<br>gentleness belongeth to this high-souled one! Who is he? Is he some god<br>or Yaksha or Gandharva?' And those foremost of women, confounded by<br>Nala's splendour and bashfulness would not accost him at all in speech.<br>And Damayanti although herself struck with amazement, smilingly addressed<br>the warlike Nala who also gently smiled at her, saying, 'What art thou, O<br>thou of faultless features, that hast come here awakening my love? O<br>sinless one, O hero of celestial form, I am anxious to know who thou art<br>that hast come hither. And why hast thou come hither? And how is it that<br>thou hast not been discovered by any one, considering that my apartments<br>are well-guarded and the king's mandates are stern.' Thus addressed by<br>the daughter of the king of the Vidarbhas, Nala replied, 'O beauteous<br>lady, know that my name is Nala. I come here as the messenger of the<br>gods. The celestials, Sakra, Agni, Varuna and Yama, desire to have thee.<br>O beautiful lady, do thou choose one of them for thy lord. It is through<br>their power that I have entered here unperceived, and it is for this<br>reason that none saw me on my way or obstructed my entrance. O gentle<br>one, I have been sent by the foremost of the celestials even for this<br>object. Hearing this, O fortunate one, do what thou pleasest.'"
