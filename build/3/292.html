                            "Markandeya continued, 'On one occasion, O Bharata, when that king, the<br>lord of the Madras, was seated with Narada in the midst of his court,<br>engaged in conversation, Savitri, accompanied by the king's counsellors,<br>came to her father's abode after having visited various sacred regions<br>and asylums. And beholding her father seated with Narada, she worshipped<br>the feet of both by bending down her head. And Narada then said, 'Whither<br>had this thy daughter gone? And, O king, whence also doth she come? Why<br>also dost thou not bestow her on a husband, now that she hath arrived at<br>the age of puberty?' Aswapati answered, saying, 'Surely it was on this<br>very business that she had been sent, and she returneth now (from her<br>search). Do thou, O celestial sage, listen, even from her as to the<br>husband she hath chosen herself!'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Then the blessed maid, commanded by her father<br>with the words,&#8212;Relate everything in detail,&#8212;regarded those words of<br>her sire as if they were those of a god, and spoke unto him thus, 'There<br>was, amongst the Salwas, a virtuous Kshatriya king known by the name of<br>Dyumatsena. And it came to pass that in course of time he became blind.<br>And that blind king possessed of wisdom had an only son. And it so<br>happened that an old enemy dwelling in the vicinity, taking advantage of<br>the king's mishap, deprived him of his kingdom. And thereupon the<br>monarch, accompanied by his wife bearing a child on her breast, went into<br>the woods. And having retired into the forests, he adopted great vows and<br>began to practise ascetic austerities. And his son, born in the city,<br>began to grow in the hermitage. That youth, fit to be my husband, I have<br>accepted in my heart for my lord!' At these words of hers, Narada said,<br>'Alas, O king, Savitri hath committed a great wrong, since, not knowing,<br>she hath accepted for her lord this Satyavan of excellent qualities! His<br>father speaketh the truth and his mother also is truthful in her speech.<br>And it is for this that the Brahmanas have named the son Satyavan. In his<br>childhood he took great delight in horses, and used to make horses of<br>clay. And he used also to draw pictures of horses. And for this that<br>youth is sometimes called by the name of Chitraswa.' The king then asked,<br>'And is prince Satyavan, who is devoted to his father, endued with energy<br>and intelligence and forgiveness and courage?' Narada replied, saying,<br>'In energy Satyavan is like unto the sun, and in wisdom like unto<br>Vrihaspati! And he is brave like unto the lord of the celestials and<br>forgiving like unto the Earth herself!' Aswapati then said, 'And is the<br>prince Satyavan liberal in gifts and devoted to the Brahmanas? Is he<br>handsome and magnanimous and lovely to behold?' Narada said, 'In bestowal<br>of gifts according to his power, the mighty son of Dyumatsena is like<br>unto Sankriti's son Rantideva. In truthfulness of speech and devotion<br>unto Brahmanas, he is like Sivi, the son of Usinara. And he is<br>magnanimous like Yayati, and beautiful like the Moon. And in beauty of<br>person he is like either of the twin Aswins. And with senses under<br>control, he is meek, and brave, and truthful! And with passion in<br>subjection he is devoted to his friends, and free from malice and modest<br>and patient. Indeed, briefly speaking, they that are possessed of great<br>ascetic merit and are of exalted character say that he is always correct<br>in his conduct and that honour is firmly seated on his brow.' Hearing<br>this, Aswapati said, 'O reverend sage, thou tellest me that he is<br>possessed of every virtue! Do thou now tell me his defects if, indeed, he<br>hath any!' Narada then said, 'He hath one only defect that hath<br>overwhelmed all his virtues. That defect is incapable of being conquered<br>by even the greatest efforts. He hath only one defect, and no other.<br>Within a year from this day, Satyavan, endued with a short life will cast<br>off his body!' Hearing these words of the sage, the king said, 'Come, O<br>Savitri, go thou and choose another for thy lord, O beautiful damsel!<br>That one great defect (in this youth) existeth, covering all his merits.<br>The illustrious Narada honoured by even the gods, sayeth, that Satyavan<br>will have to cast off his body within a year, his days being numbered!'<br>At these words of her father, Savitri said, 'The death can fall but once;<br>a daughter can be given away but one; and once only can a person say, I<br>give away! These three things can take place only once. Indeed, with a<br>life short or long, possessed of virtues or bereft of them, I have, for<br>once, selected my husband. Twice I shall not select. Having first settled<br>a thing mentally, it is expressed in words, and then it is carried out<br>into practice. Of this my mind is an example!' Narada then said, 'O best<br>of men, the heart of thy daughter Savitri wavereth not! It is not<br>possible by any means to make her swerve from this path of virtue! In no<br>other person are those virtues that dwell in Satyavan. The bestowal of<br>thy daughter, therefore, is approved by me!' The king said, 'What thou<br>hast said, O illustrious one, should never be disobeyed, for thy words<br>are true! And I shall act as thou hast said, since thou art my<br>preceptor!' Narada said, 'May the bestowal of thy daughter Savitri be<br>attended with peace! I shall now depart. Blessed be all of ye!'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Having said this, Narada rose up into the sky and<br>went to heaven. On the other hand, the king began to make preparations<br>for his daughter's wedding!'"
