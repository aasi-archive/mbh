                            "Dhaumya continued, 'O tiger among kings, I shall now describe those<br>tirthas and sacred spots that lie to the north. Do thou, O exalted one,<br>listen to me attentively. By hearing this narration, O hero, one<br>acquireth a reverential frame of mind, which conduceth to much good. In<br>that region is the highly sacred Saraswati abounding in tirthas and with<br>banks easy of descent. There also, O son of Pandu, is the ocean-going and<br>impetuous Yamuna, and the tirtha called Plakshavatarana, productive of<br>high merit and prosperity. It was there that the regenerate ones having<br>performed the Saraswata sacrifice, bathed on the completion there of. O<br>sinless one, is the well-known celestial tirtha called Agnisiras, which<br>is productive of great merit. There king Sahadeva had celebrated a<br>sacrifice measuring out the ground by a throw of the Samya. It is for<br>this reason, O Yudhishthira, that Indra sang the praises of Sahadeva in<br>verse. Those verses are still current in this world, being recited by the<br>regenerate ones, e. g., on the Yamuna Sahadeva worshipped the sacrificial<br>fire, with gifts in a hundred thousands to Brahmanas. There the<br>illustrious king, the imperial Bharata, performed five and thirty<br>horse-sacrifices. O child, we have heard that Sarabhanga of yore used to<br>fully gratify the desires of the regenerate ones. There in this region is<br>his celebrated asylum productive of great merit. In that region also, O<br>son of Pritha, is the river Saraswati, which is ever worshipped by the<br>god, where, in days of yore, the Valikhilyas, O great king, performed<br>sacrifices. In that region also, O Yudhishthira, is the well-known river<br>Drisadwati, which is productive of great merit. Then, O chief of men, are<br>Nyagrodhakhya, and Panchalya, and Punyaka and Dalbhyaghosha, and Dalbhya,<br>which are, O son of Kunti, the sacred asylum in the world of illustrious<br>Anandayasas of excellent vows and great energy, and which are celebrated<br>over the three worlds. Here also, O lord of men, the illustrious Etavarna<br>and Avavarana versed in the Vedas, learned in Vedic lore, and proficient<br>in the knowledge of Vedic rites, performed meritorious sacrifices, O<br>chief of the Bharata race! There also is Visakhayupa to which, in days of<br>yore, came the gods with Varuna and Indra, and practised ascetic<br>austerities. And therefore is that spot so eminently sacred. Here also is<br>Palasaka, where the great and illustrious and highly blessed Rishi<br>Jamadagni performed sacrifices. There all the principal rivers in their<br>embodied forms taking their respective waters stood surrounding that best<br>of sages. And there also, O monarch, Vibhavasu (fire) himself, beholding<br>that high-souled one's initiation, sang the following sloka: 'The river<br>coming to the illustrious Jamadagni while sacrificing unto the gods<br>gratified the Brahmanas with offerings of honey.' O Yudhishthira, the<br>spot where Ganga rusheth past, cleaving the foremost of mountains which<br>is frequented by Gandharvas and Yakshas and Rakshasas and Apsaras, and<br>inhabited by hunters, and Kinnaras, is called Gangadwara. O king,<br>Sanatkumara regardeth that spot visited by Brahmarshis, as also the<br>tirtha Kanakhala (that is near to it), as sacred. There also is the<br>mountain named Puru which is resorted to by great Rishis and where<br>Pururavas was born, and Bhrigu practised ascetic austerities. For this it<br>is, O king, that asylum hath become known as the great peak of<br>Bhrigutunga. Near that peak is the sacred and extensive Vadari, that<br>highly meritorious asylum, famed over the three worlds, of him, O bull of<br>the Bharata race, who is the Present, the Past and the Future, who is<br>called Narayana and the lord Vishnu, who is eternal and the best of male<br>beings, and who is pre-eminently illustrious. Near Vadari, the cool<br>current of Ganga was formerly warm, and the banks there were overspread<br>with golden sands. There the gods and Rishis of high fortune and<br>exceeding effulgence, approaching the divine lord Narayana, always<br>worship him. The entire universe with all its tirthas and holy spots is<br>there where dwelleth the divine and eternal Narayana, the Supreme soul,<br>for he is Merit, he is the Supreme Brahma, he is tirtha, he is the<br>ascetic retreat, he is the First, he is the foremost of gods, and he is<br>the great Lord of all creatures. He is eternal, he is the great Creator,<br>and he is the highest state of blessedness. Learned persons versed in the<br>scriptures attain to great happiness by knowing him. In that spot are the<br>celestial Rishis, the Siddhas, and, indeed, all the Rishis,&#8212;where<br>dwelleth the slayer of Madhu, that primeval Deity and mighty Yogin! Let<br>no doubt enter thy heart that that spot is the foremost of all holy<br>spots. These, O lord of earth, are the tirthas and sacred spots on earth,<br>that I have recited, O best of men! These all are visited by the Vasus,<br>the Sadhyas, the Adityas, the Marutas, the Aswins and the illustrious<br>Rishis resembling the celestials themselves. By journeying, O son of<br>Kunti, to those places, with the Brahmanas and ascetics that are with<br>thee and with thy blessed brothers, thou wilt be freed from anxiety!"
