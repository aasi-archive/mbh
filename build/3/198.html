                            Vaisampayana said, "The sons of Pandu and those Rishis then asked<br>Markandeya, 'Is there anybody that is blessed with longer life than<br>thou?' And Markandeya answered them, saying, 'There is without doubt, a<br>royal sage of the name of Indradyumna and his virtue having diminished,<br>he fell from heaven, crying, 'My achievements are lost!' And he came unto<br>me and asked, 'Dost thou know me?' And I answered him, saying, 'From our<br>anxiety to acquire religious merit we do not confine ourselves to any<br>home. We live but for a night in the same village or town. A person like<br>us, therefore, cannot possibly know thy pursuits. The fasts and vows we<br>observe render us weak in body and unable to follow any worldly pursuits<br>on our own behalf. Hence, one like us cannot possibly know thee.' He then<br>asked me, 'Is there any one who is longerlived than thou'? I answered<br>him, saying, 'There liveth on the Himavat an owl of the name of<br>Pravarakarna. He is older than I. He may know thee. The part of the<br>Himavat where he dwelleth is far off from here.' And at this Indradyumna<br>became a horse and carried me to where that owl lived and the king asked<br>the owl, saying, 'Dost thou know me?' And the owl seemed to reflect for a<br>moment and then said unto the king, 'I do not know thee.' And the royal<br>sage Indradyumna thereupon asked the owl, 'Is there any one who is older<br>than thou?' And thus asked the owl answered, saying, There is a lake of<br>the name of Indradyumna. In that lake dwelleth a crane of the name of<br>Nadijangha. He is older than we. Ask thou him.' And at this king<br>Indradyumna taking both myself and the owl went to that lake where the<br>crane Nadijangha dwelt. And that crane was asked by us, 'Dost thou know<br>the king Indradyumna?' And the crane thereupon seemed to reflect a little<br>and then said, 'I do not know king Indradyumna.' And the crane was asked<br>by us, 'Is there any one who is older than thou?' And he answered us,<br>saying, 'There dwelleth in this very lake a tortoise of the name of<br>Akupara. He is older than I. He may know something of this king.<br>Therefore, enquire ye of Akupara. And then that crane gave information to<br>the tortoise, saying, 'It is intended by us to ask thee something. Please<br>come to us.' And hearing this the tortoise came out of the lake to that<br>part of the bank where we all were and as he came there we asked him,<br>saying, 'Dost thou know this king Indradyumna?' And the tortoise<br>reflected for a moment. And his eyes were filled with tears and his heart<br>was much moved and he trembled all over and was nearly deprived of his<br>senses. And he said with joined hands, 'Alas, do I not know this one? He<br>had planted the sacrificial stake a thousand times at the time of<br>kindling the sacrificial fire. This lake was excavated by the feet of the<br>cows given away by this king unto the Brahmanas on the completion of the<br>sacrifice. I have lived here ever since.' And after the tortoise had said<br>all this, there came from the celestial regions a car. And an aerial<br>voice was heard which said, addressing Indradyumna, 'Come thou and obtain<br>the place thou deservest in heaven! Thy achievements are great! Come thou<br>cheerfully to thy place! Here also are certain slokas: The report of<br>virtuous deeds spreadeth over the earth and ascendeth to heaven. As long<br>as that report lasts, so long is the doer said to be in heaven. The man<br>whose evil deeds are bruited about, is said to fall down and live, as<br>long as that evil report lasts in the lower regions. Therefore should man<br>be virtuous in his acts if he is to gain Heaven. And he should seek<br>refuge in virtue, abandoning a sinful heart.'<br><br>"And hearing these words, the king said, 'Let the car stay here as long<br>as I do not take these old persons to the places whence I brought them.<br>And having brought me and the owl Pravarakarna to our respective places,<br>he went away, riding on that car, to the place that was fit for him.<br>Being longlived, I witness all this."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "It was thus that Markandeya narrated all this<br>unto the son of Pandu. And after Markandeya finished, the sons of Pandu<br>said, 'Blessed be thou! Thou hadst acted properly in causing king<br>Indradyumna who had fallen from Heaven to regain his sphere!' And<br>Markandeya answered them, saying, 'Devaki's son, Krishna, also had thus<br>raised the royal sage Nriga who had sunk in hell and caused him to regain<br>Heaven!'"
