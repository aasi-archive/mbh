                            "Lomasa said, 'O descendant of Bharata, O king, now hast thou left behind<br>the mountains Usiravija, Mainaka and Sweta, as well as the Kala hills, O<br>son of Kunti, O bull among the descendants of Bharata, here flow before<br>thee the seven Gangas. This spot is pure and holy. Here Agni blazeth<br>forth without intermission. No son of Manu is able to obtain a sight of<br>this wonder. Therefore, O son of Pandu, concentrate your mind in order<br>that he may intently behold these tirthas. Now wilt thou see the<br>play-ground of the gods, marked with their footprints, as we have passed<br>the mountain Kala. We shall now ascend that white rock&#8212;the mountain<br>Mandara, inhabited by the Yakshas, Manibhadra and Kuvera, king of the<br>Yakshas. O king, at this place eighty thousand fleet Gandharvas, and four<br>times as many Kimpurushas and Yakshas of various shapes and forms,<br>holding various weapons, attend upon Manibhadra, king of the Yakshas. In<br>these regions their power is very great. And in speed they are even as<br>the wind. They can, without doubt, displace even the lord of the<br>celestials from his seat. Protected by them, and also watched over by the<br>Rakshasas, these mountains have been rendered inaccessible. Therefore, O<br>son of Pritha, do thou concentrate thy thoughts. Besides these, O son of<br>Kunti, here are fierce ministers of Kuvera and his Rakshasa kindred. We<br>shall have to meet them, and, therefore, O Kunti's son, gather up thy<br>energies. O king the mountain Kailasa is six yojanas in height. It<br>contains a gigantic jujube tree. And, O son of Kunti, numberless gods and<br>Yakshas and Rakshasas and Kinnaras and Nagas and Suparnas and Gandharvas<br>pass this way, in going towards Kuvera's palace. O king, protected by me,<br>as well as by the might of Bhimasena, and also in virtue of thy own<br>asceticism and self-command, do thou to-day mix with them. May king<br>Varuna and Yama, conqueror of battles, and Ganga, and Yamuna, and this<br>mountain, and the Maruts and the twin Aswins, and all rivers and lakes,<br>vouchsafe thy safety. And, O effulgent one, mayst thou have safety from<br>all the celestials and the Asuras, and the Vasus. O Goddess Ganga, I hear<br>thy roar from this golden mountain, sacred to Indra. O Goddess of high<br>fortune, in these mountainous regions, protect the king, worshipped by<br>all of the Ajamidha race. O daughter of the mountain (Himalaya), this<br>king is about to enter into these mountainous regions. Do thou,<br>therefore, confer protection upon him.'<br><br>"Having thus addressed the river, Lomasa bade Yudhishthira, saying, 'Be<br>thou careful.'"<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, This confusion of Lomasa is unprecedented. Therefore,<br>protect ye Krishna, and be not careless. Lomasa knows this place to be<br>certainly difficult of access. Therefore, do ye practise here the utmost<br>cleanliness."<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, "He next addressed his brother Bhima of vast prowess,<br>saying, 'O Bhimasena, do thou protect Krishna carefully. Whether Arjuna<br>be near or away, Krishna in times of danger ever seeketh protection from<br>thee alone.'"<br><br>"Then the high-souled monarch approached the twins, Nakula and Sahadeva,<br>and after smelling their heads, and rubbing their persons, with tears<br>said unto them, 'Do not fear. Proceed, however, with caution."'
