                            Yudhishthira said, 'Anger is the slayer of men and is again their<br>prosperor. Know this, O thou possessed of great wisdom, that anger is the<br>root of all prosperity and all adversity. O thou beautiful one, he that<br>suppresseth his anger earneth prosperity. That man, again, who always<br>giveth way to anger, reapeth adversity from his fierce anger. It is seen<br>in this world that anger is the cause of destruction of every creature.<br>How then can one like me indulge his anger which is so destructive of the<br>world? The angry man commiteth sin. The angry man killeth even his<br>preceptors. The angry man insulteth even his superiors in harsh words.<br>The man that is angry faileth to distinguish between what should be said<br>and what should not. There is no act that an angry man may not do, no<br>word that an angry man may not utter. From anger a man may slay one that<br>deserveth not to be slain, and may worship one that deserveth to be<br>slain. The angry man may even send his own soul to the regions of Yama.<br>Beholding all these faults, the wise control their anger, desirous of<br>obtaining high prosperity both in this and the other world. It is for<br>this that they of tranquil souls have banished wrath. How can one like us<br>indulge in it then? O daughter of Drupada, reflecting upon all this, my<br>anger is not excited One that acteth not against a man whose wrath hath<br>been up, rescueth himself as also others from great fear. In fact, he may<br>be regarded to be the physician of the two (viz., himself and angry man).<br>If a weak man, persecuted by others, foolishly becometh angry towards men<br>that are mightier than he, he then becometh himself the cause of his own<br>destruction. And in respect of one who thus deliberately throweth away<br>his life, there are no regions hereafter to gain. Therefore, O daughter<br>of Drupada, it hath been said that a weak man should always suppress his<br>wrath. And the wise man also who though presecuted, suffereth not his<br>wrath to be roused, joyeth in the other world&#8212;having passed his<br>persecutor over in indifference. It is for this reason hath it been said<br>that a wise man, whether strong or weak, should ever forgive his<br>persecutor even when the latter is in the straits. It is for this, O<br>Krishna, that the virtuous applaud them that have conquered their wrath.<br>Indeed, it is the opinion of the virtuous that the honest and forgiving<br>man is ever victorious. Truth is more beneficial than untruth; and<br>gentleness than cruel behaviour. How can one like me, therefore, even for<br>the purpose of slaying Duryodhana, exhibit anger which hath so many<br>faults and which the virtuous banish from their souls? They that are<br>regarded by the learned of foresight, as possessed of (true) force of<br>character, are certainly those who are wrathful in outward show only. Men<br>of learning and of true insight call him to be possessed of force of<br>character who by his wisdom can suppress his risen wrath. O thou of fair<br>hips, the angry man seeth not things in their true light. The man that is<br>angry seeth not his way, nor respecteth persons. The angry man killeth<br>even those that deserve not to be killed. The man of wrath slayeth even<br>his preceptors. Therefore, the man possessing force of character should<br>ever banish wrath to a distance. The man that is overwhelmed with wrath<br>acquireth not with ease generosity, dignity, courage, skill, and other<br>attributes belonging to real force of character. A man by forsaking anger<br>can exhibit proper energy, whereas, O wise one, it is highly difficult<br>for the angry man to exhibit his energy at the proper time! The ignorant<br>always regard anger as equivalent to energy. Wrath, however hath been<br>given to man for the destruction of the world. The man, therefore, who<br>wisheth to behave properly, must ever forsake anger. Even one who hath<br>abandoned the excellent virtues of his own order, it is certain,<br>indulgeth in wrath (if behaveth properly). If fools, of mind without<br>light, transgress in every respect, how, O faultless one, can one like me<br>transgress (like them)? If amongst men there were not persons equal unto<br>the earth in forgiveness, there would be no peace among men but continued<br>strife caused by wrath. If the injured return their injuries, if one<br>chastised by his superior were to chastise his superior in return, the<br>consequence would be the destruction of every creature, and sin also<br>would prevail in the world. If the man who hath ill speeches from<br>another, returneth those speeches afterwards; if the injured man<br>returneth his injuries: if the chastised person chastiseth in return; if<br>fathers slay sons, and sons fathers and if husbands slay wives, and wives<br>husbands; then, O Krishna, how can birth take place in a world where<br>anger prevaileth so! For, O thou of handsome face, know that the birth of<br>creatures is due to peace! If the kings also, O Draupadi, giveth way to<br>wrath, his subjects soon meet with destruction. Wrath, therefore, hath<br>for its consequence the destruction and the distress of the people. And<br>because it is seen that there are in the world men who are forgiving like<br>the Earth, it is therefore that creatures derive their life and<br>prosperity. O beautiful one, one should forgive under every injury. It<br>hath been said that the continuation of species is due to man being<br>forgiving. He, indeed, is a wise and excellent person who hath conquered<br>his wrath and who showeth forgiveness even when insulted, oppressed, and<br>angered by a strong person. The man of power who controleth his wrath,<br>hath (for his enjoyment) numerous everlasting regions; while he that is<br>angry, is called foolish, and meeteth with destruction both in this and<br>the other world. O Krishna, the illustrious and forgiving Kashyapa hath,<br>in this respect, sung the following verses in honour of men that are ever<br>forgiving, 'Forgiveness is virtue; forgiveness is sacrifice, forgiveness<br>is the Vedas, forgiveness is the Shruti. He that knoweth this is capable<br>of forgiving everything. Forgiveness is Brahma; forgiveness is truth;<br>forgiveness is stored ascetic merit; forgiveness protecteth the ascetic<br>merit of the future; forgiveness is asceticism; forgiveness is holiness;<br>and by forgiveness is it that the universe is held together. Persons that<br>are forgiving attain to the regions obtainable by those that have<br>preformed meritorious sacrifices, or those that are well-conversant with<br>the Vedas, or those that have high ascetic merit. Those that perform<br>Vedic sacrifices as also those that perform the meritorious rites of<br>religion obtain other regions. Men of forgiveness, however, obtain those<br>much-adored regions that are in the world of Brahma. Forgiveness is the<br>might of the mighty; forgiveness is sacrifice; forgiveness is quiet of<br>mind. How, O Krishna, can one like us abandon forgiveness, which is such,<br>and in which are established Brahma, and truth, and wisdom and the<br>worlds? The man of wisdom should ever forgive, for when he is capable of<br>forgiving everything, he attaineth to Brahma. The world belongeth to<br>those that are forgiving; the other world is also theirs. The forgiving<br>acquire honours here, and a state of blessedness hereafter. Those men<br>that ever conquer their wrath by forgiveness, obtain the higher regions.<br>Therefore hath it been said that forgiveness is the highest virtue.'<br>Those are the verses sung by Kashyapa in respect of those that are<br>everforgiving. Having listened, O Draupadi, to these verses in respect of<br>forgiveness, content thyself! Give not way to thy wrath! Our grandsire,<br>the son of Santanu, will worship peace; Krishna, the son of Devaki, will<br>worship peace; the preceptor (Drona) and Vidura called Kshatri will both<br>speak of peace; Kripa and Sanjaya also will preach peace. And Somadatta<br>and Yuyutshu and Drona's son and our grandsire Vyasa, every one of them<br>speaketh always of peace. Ever urged by these towards peace, the king<br>(Dhritarashtra) will, I think, return us our kingdom. If however, he<br>yieldeth to temptation, he will meet with destruction. O lady, a crisis<br>hath come in the history of Bharatas for plunging them into calamity!<br>This hath been my certain conclusion from some time before! Suyodhana<br>deserveth not the kingdom. Therefore hath he been unable to acquire<br>forgiveness. I, however, deserve the sovereignty and therefore is it that<br>forgiveness hath taken possession of me. Forgiveness and gentleness are<br>the qualities of the self-possessed. They represent eternal virtue. I<br>shall, therefore, truly adopt those qualities."
