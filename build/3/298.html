                            Janamejaya said,&#8212;"What, O Brahmana, was that great fear entertained by<br>Yudhishthira in respect of Karna, for which Lomasa had conveyed to the<br>son of Pandu a message of deep import from Indra in these words, That<br>intense fear of thine which thou dost never express to any one, I will<br>remove after Dhananjaya goeth from hence? And, O best of ascetics, why<br>was it that the virtuous Yudhishthira never expressed it to any one?"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "As thou askest me, O tiger among kings, I will relate<br>that history unto thee! Do thou listen to my words, O best of the<br>Bharatas! After twelve years (of their exile) had passed away and the<br>thirteenth year had set in, Sakra, ever friendly to the sons of Pandu,<br>resolved to beg of Karna (his ear-rings). And, O mighty monarch,<br>ascertaining this intention of the great chief of the celestials about<br>(Karna's) ear-rings, Surya, having effulgence for his wealth, went unto<br>Karna. And, O foremost of kings, while that hero devoted to the Brahmanas<br>and truthful in speech was lying down at night at his ease on a rich bed<br>overlaid with a costly sheet, the effulgent deity, filled with kindness<br>and affection for his son, showed himself, O Bharata, unto him in his<br>dreams. And assuming from ascetic power the form of a handsome Brahmana<br>versed in the Vedas, Surya sweetly said unto Karna these words for his<br>benefit, 'O son, do thou O Karna, listen to these words of mine, O thou<br>foremost of truthful persons! O mighty-armed one, I tell thee to-day from<br>affection, what is for thy great good! With the object, O Karna, of<br>obtaining thy ear-rings, Sakra, moved by the desire of benefiting the<br>sons of Pandu, will come unto thee, disguised as a Brahmana! He, as Well<br>as all the world, knoweth thy character, viz., that when solicited by<br>pious people, thou givest away but never takest in gift! Thou, O son,<br>givest unto Brahmanas wealth or any other thing that is asked of thee and<br>never refusest anything to anybody. Knowing thee to be such, the subduer<br>himself of Paka will come to beg of thee thy ear-rings and coat of mail.<br>When he beggeth the ear-rings of thee, it behoveth thee not to give them<br>away, but to gratify him with sweet speeches to the best of thy power.<br>Even this, is for thy supreme good! While asking thee for the ear-rings,<br>thou shalt, with various reasons, repeatedly refuse Purandara who is<br>desirous of obtaining them, offering him, instead, various other kinds of<br>wealth, such as gems and women and kine, and citing various precedents.<br>If thou, O Kama, givest away thy beautiful ear-rings born with thee, thy<br>life being shortened, thou wilt meet with death! Arrayed in thy mail and<br>ear-rings, thou wilt, O bestower of honours, be incapable of being slain<br>by foes in battle! Do thou lay to heart these words of mine! Both these<br>jewelled ornaments have sprung from Amrita. Therefore, they should be<br>preserved by thee, if thy life is at all dear to thee."<br><br>"Hearing these words, Kama said, 'Who art thou that tellest me so,<br>showing me such kindness? If it pleaseth thee, tell me, O illustrious<br>one, who thou art in the guise of a Brahmana!'&#8212;The Brahmana thereupon<br>said, 'O son, I am he of a thousand rays! Out of affection, I point out<br>to thee the path! Act thou according to my words, as it is for thy great<br>good to do so!' Kama replied, 'Surely, this itself is highly fortunate<br>for me that the god himself of splendour addresses me today, seeking my<br>welfare. Listen, however, to these words of mine! May it please thee, O<br>bestower of boons, it is only from affection that I tell thee this! If I<br>am dear to thee, I should not be dissuaded from the observance of my vow!<br>O thou that are possessed of the wealth of effulgence, the whole world<br>knoweth this to be my vow that, of a verity, I am prepared to give away<br>life itself unto superior Brahmanas! If, O best of all rangers of the<br>sky, Sakra cometh to me, disguised as a Brahmana, to beg for the benefit<br>of the sons of Pandu, I will, O chief of the celestials, give him the<br>ear-rings and the excellent mail, so that my fame which hath spread over<br>the three worlds may not suffer any diminution! For persons like us, it<br>is not fit to save life by a blame-worthy act. On the contrary, it is<br>even proper for us to meet death with the approbation of the world and<br>under circumstances bringing fame. Therefore, will I bestow upon Indra<br>the ear-rings with my coat of mail! If the slayer himself of Vala and<br>Vritra cometh to ask for the ear-rings for the benefit of the sons of<br>Pandu, that will conduce to my fame, leading at the same time to his<br>infamy! O thou possessed of splendour, I wish for fame in this world,<br>even if it is to be purchased with life itself, for they that have fame<br>enjoy the celestial regions, while they that are destitute of it are<br>lost. Fame keepeth people alive in this world even like a mother, while<br>infamy killeth men even though they may move about with bodies<br>undestroyed. O lord of the worlds, O thou possessed of the wealth of<br>effulgence, that fame is the life of men is evidenced by an ancient sloka<br>sung by the Creator himself,&#8212;In the next world it is fame that is the<br>chief support of a person, while in this world pure fame lengthens life.<br>Therefore, by giving away my ear-rings and mail with both of which I was<br>born I will win eternal fame! And by duly giving away the same to<br>Brahmanas according to the ordinance, by offering up my body (as a gift<br>to the gods) in the sacrifice of war, by achieving feats difficult of<br>performance, and by conquering my foes in fight, I will acquire nothing<br>but renown. And by dispelling on the field of battle the fears of the<br>affrighted that may beg for their lives, and relieving old men and boys<br>and Brahmanas from terror and anxiety, I will win excellent fame and the<br>highest heaven. My fame is to be protected with the sacrifice of even my<br>life. Even this, know thou, is my vow! By giving away such a valuable<br>gift to Maghavan disguised as a Brahmana, I will, O god, acquire in this<br>world the most exalted state.'"
