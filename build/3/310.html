                            Yudhishthira said, "There is no limit to calamities. Nor is it possible<br>to ascertain either their final or efficient cause. It is the Lord of<br>justice alone who distributeth the fruits of both virtue and vice.'<br>Thereupon Bhima said, 'Surely, this calamity hath befallen us, because I<br>did not slay the Pratikamin on the very spot, when he dragged Krishna as<br>a slave into the assembly. And Arjuna said, 'Surely, this calamity hath<br>befallen us because I resented not those biting words piercing the very<br>bones, uttered by the Suta's son!' And Sahadeva said, 'Surely, O Bharata,<br>this calamity hath befallen us because I did not slay Sakuni when he<br>defeated thee at dice!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Then king Yudhishthira addressed Nakula saying,<br>'Do thou, O son of Madri, climb this tree and look around the ten points<br>of the horizon. Do thou see whether there is water near us or such trees<br>as grow on watery grounds! O child, these thy brothers are all fatigued<br>and thirsty.' Thereupon saying, 'So be it,' Nakula speedily climbed up a<br>tree, and having looked around, said unto his eldest brother, 'O king, I<br>see many a tree that groweth by the water-side, and I hear also the cries<br>of cranes. Therefore, without doubt, water must be somewhere here.'<br>Hearing these words, Kunti's son Yudhishthira, firm in truth, said, 'O<br>amiable one, go thou and fetch water in these quivers!' Saying, 'So be<br>it,' at the command of his eldest brother Nakula quickly proceeded<br>towards the place where there was water and soon came upon it. And<br>beholding a crystal lake inhabited by cranes he desired to drink of it,<br>when he heard these words from the sky, 'O child, do not commit this rash<br>act! This lake hath already been in my possession. Do thou, O son of<br>Madri, first answer my questions and then drink of this water and take<br>away (as much as thou requirest). Nakula, however, who was exceedingly<br>thirsty, disregarding these words, drank of the cool water, and having<br>drunk of it, dropped down dead. And, O represser of foes, seeing Nakula's<br>delay, Yudhishthira the son of Kunti said unto Sahadeva, the heroic<br>brother of Nakula, 'O Sahadeva, it is long since our brother, he who was<br>born immediately before thee, hath gone from hence! Do thou, therefore,<br>go and bring back thy uterine brother, together with water.' At this,<br>Sahadeva, saying, 'So be it,' set out in that direction; and coming to<br>the spot, beheld his brother lying dead on the ground. And afflicted at<br>the death of his brother, and suffering severely from thirst, he advanced<br>towards the water, when these words were heard by him, 'O child, do not<br>commit this rash act! This lake hath already been in my possession. First<br>answer my question, and then drink of the water and take away as much as<br>thou mayst require.' Sahadeva, however, who was extremely thirsty,<br>disregarding these words, drank of the water, and having drunk of it,<br>dropped down dead. Then Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, said unto Vijaya,<br>'It is long since, O Vibhatsu, that thy two brothers have gone, O<br>represser of foes! Blessed be thou! Do thou bring them back, together<br>with water. Thou art, O child, the refuge of us all when plunged in<br>distress!' Thus addressed, the intelligent Gudakesa, taking his bow and<br>arrows and also his naked sword, set out tor that lake of waters. And<br>reaching that spot, he whose car was drawn by white steeds beheld those<br>tigers among men, his two younger brothers who had come to fetch water,<br>lying dead there. And seeing them as if asleep, that lion among men,<br>exceedingly aggrieved, raised his bow and began to look around that wood.<br>But he found none in that mighty forest. And, being fatigued, he who was<br>capable of drawing the bow by his left hand as well, rushed in the<br>direction of the water. And as he was rushing (towards the water), he<br>heard these words from the sky, 'Why dost thou approach this water? Thou<br>shalt not be able to drink of it by force. If thou, O Kaunteya, can<br>answer the question I will put to thee, then only shalt thou drink of the<br>water and take away as much as thou requirest, O Bharata!' Thus<br>forbidden, the son of Pritha said, 'Do thou forbid me by appearing before<br>me! And when thou shalt be sorely pierced with my arrows, thou wilt not<br>then again speak in this way!' Having said this, Partha covered all sides<br>with arrows inspired by mantras. And he also displayed his skill in<br>shooting at an invisible mark by sound alone. And, O bull of the Bharata<br>race, sorely afflicted with thirst, he discharged barbed darts and<br>javelins and iron arrows, and showered on the sky innumerable shafts<br>incapable of being baffled. Thereupon, the invisible Yaksha said, 'What<br>need of all this trouble, O son of Pritha? Do thou drink only after<br>answering my questions! If thou drink, however, without answering my<br>questions, thou shalt die immediately after.' Thus addressed, Pritha's<br>son Dhananjaya capable of drawing the bow with his left hand as well,<br>disregarding those words, drank of the water, and immediately after<br>dropped down dead. And (seeing Dhananjaya's delay) Kunti's son<br>Yudhishthira addressed Bhimasena, saying, 'O represser of foes, it is a<br>long while that Nakula and Sahadeva and Vibhatsu have gone to fetch<br>water, and they have not come yet, O Bharata! Good betide thee! Do thou<br>bring them back, together with water!' Thereupon saying, 'So be it,'<br>Bhimasena set out for that place where those tigers among men, his<br>brothers, lay dead. And beholding them, Bhima afflicted though he was<br>with thirst, was exceedingly distressed. And that mighty armed hero<br>thought all that to have been the act of some Yaksha or Rakshasa. And<br>Pritha's son Vrikodara thought, 'I shall surely have to fight today. Let<br>me, therefore, first appease my thirst.' Then that bull of the Bharata<br>race rushed forward with the intention of drinking. Thereupon the Yaksha<br>said, 'O child, do not commit this rash act! This lake hath already been<br>in my possession. Do thou first answer my questions, and then drink and<br>take away as much water as thou requirest!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed by that Yaksha of immeasurable<br>energy, Bhima, without answering his questions, drank of the water. And<br>as soon as he drank, he fell down dead on the spot. Then thinking that<br>his brothers had left him long since, Yudhishthira waited for some time.<br>And the king said unto himself again and again, 'Why is it that the two<br>sons of Madri are delaying? And why doth the wielder also of the Gandiva<br>delay? And why doth Bhima too, endued with great strength, delay? I shall<br>go to search for them!' And resolved to do this, the mighty-armed<br>Yudhishthira then rose up, his heart burning in grief. And that bull<br>among men, the royal son of Kunti thought within himself. 'Is this forest<br>under some malign influence? Or, is it infested by some wicked beasts?<br>Or, have they all fallen, in consequence of having disregarded some<br>mighty being? Or, not finding water in the spot whither those heroes had<br>first repaired, they have spent all this time in search through the<br>forest? What is that reason for which those bulls among men do not come<br>back?' And speaking in this strain, that foremost of monarchs, the<br>illustrious Yudhishthira, entered into that mighty forest where no human<br>sound was heard and which was inhabited by deer and bears and birds, and<br>which was adorned with trees that were bright and green, and which echoed<br>with the hum of the black-bee and the notes of winged warblers. As he was<br>proceeding along, he beheld that beautiful lake which looked as if it had<br>been made by the celestial artificer himself. And it was adorned with<br>flowers of a golden hue and with lotuses and Sindhuvars. And it abounded<br>with canes and Ketakas and Karaviras and Pippalas, and fatigued with<br>toil, Yudhishthira saw that tank and was struck with wonder."
