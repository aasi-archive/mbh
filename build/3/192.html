                            Vaisampayana said, "The Rishis, the Brahmanas, and Yudhishthira then<br>asked Markandeya, saying, 'How did the Rishi Vaka become so long lived?'<br><br>"Thus asked by them, Markandeya answered, 'The royal sage Vaka is a great<br>ascetic and endowed with long life. Ye need not enquire into the reason<br>of this.'<br><br>"Hearing this, O Bharata, the son of Kunti, king Yudhishthira the just,<br>along with his brothers, then asked Markandeya saying, 'It hath been<br>heard by us that both Vaka and Dalvya are of great souls and endowed with<br>immortality and that those Rishis, held in universal reverence, are the<br>friends of the chief of the gods. O Holy One, I desire to listen lo the<br>(history of the) meeting of Vaka and Indra that is full of both joy and<br>woe. Narrate thou that history unto us succinctly.'<br><br>"Markandeya said, 'When that horrible conflict between the gods and the<br>Asuras was over, Indra became the ruler of the three worlds. The clouds<br>showered rain copiously. And the dwellers of the world had abundance of<br>harvests, and were excellent in disposition. And devoted to virtue, they<br>always practised morality and enjoyed peace. And all persons, devoted to<br>the duties of their respective orders, were perfectly happy and cheerful,<br>and the slayer of Vala, beholding all the creatures of the world happy<br>and cheerful, became himself filled with joy. And he of a hundred<br>sacrifices, the chief of the gods seated on the back of his elephant<br>Airavata, surveyed his happy subjects, and he cast his eyes on delightful<br>asylums of Rishis, on various auspicious rivers, towns full of<br>prosperity, and villages and rural regions in the enjoyment of plenty.<br>And he also cast his eyes upon kings devoted to the practice of virtue<br>and well-skilled in ruling their subjects. And he also looked upon tanks<br>and reservoirs and wells and lakes and smaller lakes all full of water<br>and adored by best of Brahmanas in the observance, besides, of various<br>excellent vows, and then descending on the delightful earth, O king, the<br>god of a hundred sacrifices, proceeded towards a blessed asylum teeming<br>with animals and birds, situated by the side of the sea, in the<br>delightful and auspicious regions of the East on a spot overgrown with<br>abundance of vegetation. And the chief of the gods beheld Vaka in that<br>asylum, and Vaka also, beholding the ruler of the Immortals, became<br>highly glad, and he worshipped Indra by presenting him with water to wash<br>his feet, a carpet to sit upon, the usual offering of the Arghya, and<br>fruit and roots. And the boon-giving slayer of Vala, the divine ruler of<br>those that know not old age, being seated at his ease, asked Vaka the<br>following question, 'O sinless Muni, thou hast lived for a hundred years!<br>Tell me, O Brahmana, what the sorrows are of those that are immortal!'<br><br>Markandeya continued, "Hearing this, Vaka answered, saying, 'Life with<br>persons that are disagreeable, separation from those that are agreeable<br>and beloved, companionship with the wicked, these are the evils which<br>they that are immortal have to bear. The death of sons and wives, of<br>kinsmen and friends, and the pain of dependence on others, are some of<br>the greatest of evils. (These may all be noticed in a deathless life).<br>There is no more pitiable sight in the world, as I conceive, than that of<br>men destitute of wealth being insulted by others. The acquisition of<br>family dignity by those that have it not, the loss of family dignity by<br>those that have it, unions and disunions,&#8212;these all are noticeable by<br>those that lead deathless lives. How they that have no family dignity but<br>have prosperity, win what they have not&#8212;all this, O god of a hundred<br>sacrifices, is before thy very eyes! What can be more pitiable than the<br>calamities and reverses sustained by the gods, the Asuras, the<br>Gandharvas, men, the snakes, and the Rakshasas! They that have been of<br>good families suffer afflictions in consequence of their subjection to<br>persons that are ill-born and the poor are insulted by the rich. What can<br>be more pitiable than these? Innumerable examples of such contradictory<br>dispensations are seen in the world. The foolish and the ignorant are<br>cheerful and happy while the learned and the wise suffer misery!<br>Plentiful instances of misery and woe are seen among men in this world!<br>(They that lead deathless lives are destined to behold all these and<br>suffer on that account.)'<br><br>"Indra then said, 'O thou of great good fortune, tell me again, what the<br>joys are of those persons that lead deathless lives,&#8212;joys that are<br>adored by gods and Rishis!'<br><br>"Vaka answered, 'If without having to associate with a wicked friend, a<br>man cooks scanty vegetables in his own house at the eight or the twelfth<br>part of the day, there can be nothing happier than that.[49] He in whose<br>case the day is not counted is not called voracious. And, O Maghavan,<br>happiness is even his own whose scanty vegetables are cooked. Earned by<br>his own efforts, without having to depend upon any one, he that eateth<br>even fruits and vegetables in his own house is entitled to respect. He<br>that eateth in another's house the food given to him in contempt, even if<br>that food be rich and sweet, doth what is despicable. This, therefore, is<br>the opinion of the wise that fie on the food of that mean wretch who like<br>a dog or a Rakshasa eateth at another's house. If after treating guests<br>and servants and offering food to the manes a good Brahmana eateth what<br>remains, there can be nothing happier than that. There is nothing sweeter<br>or more sacred, O thou of a hundred sacrifices, than that food which such<br>a person takes after serving the guest with the first portion thereof.<br>Each mouthful (of rice) that the Brahmana eats after having served the<br>guest, produces merit equal to what attaches to the gift of a thousand<br>kine. And whatever sins such a one may have committed in his youth are<br>all washed away of a certainty. The water in the hands of the Brahmana<br>that hath been fed and honoured with a pecuniary gift (after the feeding<br>is over) when touched with water (sprinkled by him that feeds), instantly<br>purges off all the sins of the latter!'"<br><br>"Speaking of these and various other things with Vaka, the chief of the<br>gods went away to heaven.'"[50]
