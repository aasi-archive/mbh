                            "Draupadi said, 'I do not ever disregard or slander religion, O son of<br>Pritha! Why should I disregard God, the lord of all creatures? Afflicted<br>with woe, know me, O Bharata, to be only raving I will once more indulge<br>in lamentations; listen to me with attention O persecutor of all enemies,<br>every conscious creature should certainly act in this world. It is only<br>the immobile, and not other creatures, that may live without acting. The<br>calf, immediately after its birth, sucketh the mothers' teat. Persons<br>feel pain in consequence of incantations performed with their statues. It<br>seemeth, therefore, O Yudhishthira, that creatures derive the character<br>of their lives from their acts of former lives. Amongst mobile creatures<br>man differeth in this respect that he aspireth, O bull of the Bharata<br>race, to affect his course of life in this and the other world by means<br>of his acts. Impelled by the inspiration of a former life, all creatures<br>visibly (reap) in this world the fruits of their acts. Indeed, all<br>creatures live according to the inspiration of a former life, even the<br>Creator and the Ordainer of the universe, like a crane that liveth on the<br>water (untaught by any one.) If a creature acteth not, its course of life<br>is impossible. In the case of a creature, therefore, there must be action<br>and not inaction. Thou also shouldest act, and not incur censure by<br>abandoning action. Cover thyself up, as with an armour, with action.<br>There may or may not be even one in a thousand who truly knoweth the<br>utility of acts or work. One must act for protecting as also increasing<br>his wealth; for if without seeking to earn, one continueth to only spend,<br>his wealth, even if it were a hoard huge as Himavat, would soon be<br>exhausted. All the creatures in the world would have been exterminated,<br>if there were no action. If also acts bore no fruits, creatures would<br>never have multiplied. It is even seen that creatures sometimes perform<br>acts that have no fruits, for without acts the course of life itself<br>would be impossible. Those persons in the world who believe in destiny,<br>and those again who believe in chance, are both the worst among men.<br>Those only that believe in the efficacy of acts are laudable. He that<br>lieth at ease, without activity, believing in destiny alone, is soon<br>destroyed like an unburnt earthen pot in water. So also he that believeth<br>in chance, i.e., sitteth inactive though capable of activity liveth not<br>long, for his life is one of weakness and helplessness. If any person<br>accidentally acquireth any wealth, it is said he deriveth it from chance,<br>for no one's effort hath brought about the result. And, O son of Pritha,<br>whatever of good fortune a person obtaineth in consequence of religious<br>rites, that is called providential. The fruit, however that a person<br>obtaineth by acting himself, and which is the direct result of those acts<br>of his, is regarded as proof of personal ability. And, O best of men,<br>know that the wealth one obtaineth spontaneously and without cause is<br>said to be a spontaneous acquisition. Whatever is thus obtained by<br>chance, by providential dispensation, spontaneously, of as the result of<br>one's acts is, however, the consequence of the acts of a former life. And<br>God, the Ordainer of the universe, judging according to the acts of<br>former lives, distributeth among men their portions in this world.<br>Whatever acts, good or bad, a person performeth, know that they are the<br>result of God's, arrangements agreeably to the acts of a former life.<br>This body is only the instruments in the hands of God, for doing the acts<br>that are done. Itself, inert, it doth as God urgeth it to do. O son of<br>Kunti, it is the Supreme Lord of all who maketh all creatures do what<br>they do. The creatures themselves are inert. O hero, man, having first<br>settled some purpose in his mind, accomplisheth it, himself working with<br>the aid of his intelligence. We, therefore, say that man is himself the<br>cause (of what he doeth). O bull among men, it is impossible to number<br>the acts of men, for mansions and towns are the result of man's acts.<br>Intelligent men know, by help of their intellect, that oil may be had<br>from sesame, curds from milk, and that food may be cooked by means of<br>igniting fuel. They know also the means for accomplishing all these. And<br>knowing them, they afterwards set themselves, with proper appliances, to<br>accomplish them. And creatures support their lives by the results<br>achieved in these directions by their own acts. If a work is executed by<br>a skilled workman, it is executed well. From differences (in<br>characteristics), another work may be said to be that of an unskilful<br>hand. If a person were not, in the matter of his acts, himself the cause<br>thereof, then sacrifices would not bear any fruits in his case nor would<br>any body be a disciple or a master. It is because a person is himself the<br>cause of his work that he is applauded when he achieved success. So the<br>doer is censured if he faileth. If a man were not himself the cause of<br>his acts, how would all this be justified? Some say that everything is<br>the result of Providential dispensation; others again, that this is not<br>so, but that everything which is supposed to be the result of destiny or<br>chance is the result of the good or the bad acts of former lives. It is<br>seen, possessions are obtained from chance, as also from destiny<br>Something being from destiny and something from chance, something is<br>obtained by exertion. In the acquisition of his objects, there is no<br>fourth cause in the case of man. Thus say those that are acquainted with<br>truth and skilled in knowledge. If, however, God himself were not the<br>giver of good and bad fruits, then amongst creatures there would not be<br>any that was miserable. If the effect of former acts be a myth, then all<br>purposes for which man would work should be successful. They, therefore,<br>that regard the three alone (mentioned above) as the doors of all success<br>and failure in the world, (without regarding the acts of former life),<br>are dull and inert like the body itself. For all this, however, a person<br>should act. This is the conclusion of Manu himself. The person that doth<br>not act, certainly succumbeth, O Yudhishthira. The man of action in this<br>world generally meeteth with success. The idle, however, never achieveth<br>success. If success, becometh impossible, then should one seek to remove<br>the difficulties that bar his way to success. And, O king, if a person<br>worketh (hard), his debt (to the gods) is cancelled (whether he achieveth<br>success or not). The person that is idle and lieth at his length, is<br>overcome by adversity; while he that is active and skillful is sure to<br>reap success and enjoy prosperity. Intelligent persons engaged in acts<br>with confidence in themselves regard all who are diffident as doubting<br>and unsuccessful. The confident and faithful, however, are regarded by<br>them as successful. And this moment misery hath overtaken us. If,<br>however, thou betakest to action, that misery will certainly be removed.<br>If thou meetest failure, then that will furnish a proof unto thee and<br>Vrikodara and Vivatsu and the twins (that ye are unable to snatch the<br>kingdom from the foe). The acts of others, it is seen, are crowned with<br>success. It is probable that ours also will be successful. How can one<br>know beforehand what the consequence will be? Having exerted thyself thou<br>wilt know what the fruit of thy exertion will be. The tiller tilleth with<br>the plough the soil and soweth the seeds thereon. He then sitteth silent,<br>for the clouds (after that) are the cause that would help the seeds to<br>grow into plants. If however, the clouds favour him not, the tiller is<br>absolved from all blame. He sayeth unto himself, 'What others do, I have<br>done. If, notwithstanding this, I meet with failure, no blame can attach<br>to me.' Thinking so, he containeth himself and never indulgeth in<br>self-reproach. O Bharata, no one should despair saying, 'Oh, I am acting,<br>yet success is not mine! For there are two other causes, besides<br>exertion, towards success. Whether there be success or failure, there<br>should be no despair, for success in acts dependeth upon the union; of<br>many circumstances. If one important element is wanting, success doth not<br>become commensurate, or doth not come at all. If however, no exertion is<br>made, there can be no success. Nor is there anything to applaud in the<br>absence of all exertion. The intelligent, aided by their intelligence,<br>and according to their full might bring place, time, means, auspicious<br>rites, for the acquisition of prosperity. With carefulness and vigilance<br>should one set himself to work, his chief guide being his prowess. In the<br>union of qualities necessary for success in work, prowess seemeth to be<br>the chief. When the man of intelligence seeth his enemy superior to him<br>in many qualities, he should seek the accomplishment of his purposes by<br>means, of the arts of conciliation and proper appliances. He should also<br>wish evil unto his foe and his banishment. Without speaking of mortal<br>man, if his foe were even the ocean or the hills, he should be guided by<br>such motives. A person by his activity in searching for the holes of his<br>enemies, dischargeth his debt to himself as also to his friends. No man<br>should ever disparage himself for the man that disparageth himself never<br>earneth high prosperity. O Bharata, success in this world is attainable<br>on such conditions! In fact, success in the World is said to depend on<br>acting according to time and circumstances. My father formerly kept a<br>learned Brahmana with him. O bull of the Bharata race, he said all this<br>unto my father. Indeed, these instructions as to duty, uttered by<br>Vrihaspati himself, were first taught to my brothers. It was from them<br>that I heard these afterwards while in my father's house. And, O<br>Yudhishthira, while at intervals of business, I went out (of the inner<br>apartments) and sat on the lap of my father, that learned Brahmana used<br>to recite unto me these truths, sweetly consoling me therewith!"
