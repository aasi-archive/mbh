                            "The hawk said, 'All the kings of the earth represent thee as a pious<br>ruler. Wherefore, O prince, has thou then stopped to perpetrate a deed<br>not sanctioned by the ordinance? I have been sore afflicted with hunger.<br>Do thou not withhold from me that which hath been appointed by the Deity<br>for my food,&#8212;under the impression that thereby thou servest the<br>interests of virtue, whereas in reality, thou wilt forsake it, (by<br>committing thyself to this act). Thereupon, the king said, 'O best of the<br>feathered race, afflicted with fear of thee, and desirous of escaping<br>from thy hands, this bird, all in a hurry, hath come up to me asking for<br>life. When this pigeon hath in such a manner sought my protection, why<br>dost thou not see that the highest merit is even in my not surrendering<br>it unto thee? And it is trembling with fear, and is agitated, and is<br>seeking its life from me. It is therefore certainly blameworthy to<br>forsake it. He that slayeth a Brahmana, he that slaughtered a cow&#8212;the<br>common mother of all the worlds&#8212;and he that forsaketh one seeking for<br>protection are equally sinful.' Thereat the hawk replied, 'O lord of<br>earth, it is from food that all beings derive their life, and it is food<br>also that nourisheth and sustaineth them. A man can live long even after<br>forsaking what is dearest to him, but he cannot do so, after abstaining<br>from food. Being deprived of food, my life, O ruler of men, will surely<br>leave this body, and will attain to regions unknown to such troubles. But<br>at my death, O pious king, my wife and children will surely perish, and<br>by protecting this single pigeon. O prince, thou dost not protect many<br>lives. The virtue that standeth in the way of another virtue, is<br>certainly no virtue at all, but in reality is unrighteousness. But O<br>king, whose prowess consisteth in truth, that virtue is worthy of the<br>name, which is not conflicting. After instituting a comparison between<br>opposing virtues, and weighing their comparative merits, one, O great<br>prince, ought to espouse that which is not opposing. Do thou, therefore,<br>O king, striking a balance between virtues, adopt that which<br>preponderates.' At this the king said, 'O best of birds, as thou speakest<br>words fraught with much good, I suspect thee to be Suparna, the monarch<br>of birds. I have not the least hesitation to declare that thou art fully<br>conversant with the ways of virtue. As thou speakest wonders about<br>virtue, I think that there is nothing connected with it, that is unknown<br>to thee. How canst thou then consider the forsaking of one, seeking for<br>help, as virtuous? Thy efforts in this matter, O ranger of the skies,<br>have been in quest of food. Thou canst, however, appease thy hunger with<br>some other sort of food, even more copious. I am perfectly willing to<br>procure for thee any sort of food that to thee may seem most tasteful,<br>even if it be an ox, or a boar, or a deer, or a buffalo.' Thereupon the<br>hawk said, 'O great king, I am not desirous of eating (the flesh of) a<br>boar or an ox or the various species of beasts. What have I to do with<br>any other sort of food? Therefore, O bull among the Kshatriyas, leave to<br>me this pigeon, whom Heaven hath today ordained for my food, O ruler of<br>earth, that hawks eat pigeons is the eternal provision. O prince, do not<br>for support embrace a plantain tree, not knowing its want of strength.'<br>The king said, 'Ranger of the skies, I am willing to bestow on thee this<br>rich province of my race, or any other thing that to thee may seem<br>desirable. With the sole exception of this pigeon, which hath approached<br>me craving my protection, I shall be glad to give unto thee anything that<br>thou mayst like. Let me know what I shall have to do for the deliverance<br>of this bird. But this I shall not return to thee on any condition<br>whatever.'"<br><br>"The hawk said, 'O great ruler of men, if thou hast conceived an<br>affection for this pigeon, then cut off a portion of thine own flesh, and<br>weigh it in a balance, against this pigeon. And when thou hast found it<br>equal (in weight) to the pigeon, then do thou give it unto me, and that<br>will be to my satisfaction.' Then the king replied, This request of<br>thine, O hawk, I consider as a favour unto me, and, therefore, I will<br>give unto thee even my own flesh, after weighing it in a balance.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'Saying this, O mighty son of Kunti, the highly virtuous<br>king cut off a portion of his own flesh, and placed it in a balance,<br>against the pigeon. But when he found that pigeon exceeded his flesh in<br>weight, he once more cut off another portion of his flesh, and added it<br>to the former. When portion after portion had been repeatedly added to<br>weigh against the pigeon, and no more flesh was left on his body, he<br>mounted the scale himself, utterly devoid of flesh.<br><br>"The hawk then said, 'I am Indra, O virtuous king, and this pigeon is<br>Agni, the carrier of the sacrificial clarified butter. We had come unto<br>thy sacrificial ground, desirous of testing thy merit. Since thou hast<br>cut off thy own flesh from thy body, thy glory shall be resplendent, and<br>shall surpass that of all others in the world. As long as men, O king,<br>shall speak of thee, so long shall thy glory endure, and thou shalt<br>inhabit the holy regions.' Saying this to the king, Indra ascended to<br>heaven. And the virtuous king Usinara, after having filled heaven and<br>earth with the merit of his pious deeds, ascended to heaven in a radiant<br>shape. Behold, O king, the residence of that noble-hearted monarch. Here,<br>O king, are seen holy sages and gods, together with virtuous and<br>highsouled Brahmanas."
