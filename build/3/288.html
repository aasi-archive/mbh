                            "Markandeya said, The Ten-necked (Ravana), excited to fury at the death<br>of his beloved son, ascended his car decked with gold and gems. And<br>surrounded by terrible Rakshasas with various kinds of weapons in their<br>hands, Ravana rushed towards Rama, fighting with numerous monkey-chief.<br>And beholding him rushing in wrath towards the monkey army, Mainda and<br>Nila and Nala and Angada, and Hanuman and Jamvuman, surrounded him with<br>all their troops. And those foremost of monkeys and bears began to<br>exterminate with trunks of trees, the soldiers of the Ten-necked<br>(Ravana), in his every sight. And beholding the enemy slaughtering his<br>troops, the Rakshasa king, Ravana, possessed of great powers of illusion,<br>began to put them forth. And forth from his body began to spring hundreds<br>and thousands of Rakshasas armed with arrows and lances and double-edged<br>swords in hand. Rama, however, with a celestial weapon slew all those<br>Rakshasas. The king of the Rakshasas then once more put forth his prowess<br>of illusion. The Ten-faced, producing from his body numerous warriors<br>resembling, O Bharata, both Rama and Lakshmana, rushed towards the two<br>brothers. And then those Rakshasas, hostile to Rama and Lakshmana and<br>armed with bows and arrows, rushed towards Rama, and beholding that power<br>of illusion put forth by the king of Rakshasas, that descendant of<br>Ikshwaku's race, the son of Sumitra, addressed Rama in these heroic<br>words, 'Slay those Rakshasas, those wretches with forms like thy own!'<br>And Rama, thereupon slew those and other Rakshasas of forms resembling<br>his own. And that time Matali, the charioteer of Indra, approached Rama<br>on the field of battle, with a car effulgent as the Sun and unto which<br>were yoked horses of a tawny hue. And Matali said, 'O son of Kakutstha's<br>race, this excellent and victorious car, unto which have been yoked this<br>pair of tawny horses, belonging to the Lord of celestials! It is on this<br>excellent car, O tiger among men, that Indra hath slain in battle<br>hundreds of Daityas and Danavas! Therefore, O tiger among men, do thou,<br>riding on the car driven by me, quickly slay Ravana in battle! Do not<br>delay in achieving this!' Thus addressed by him, the descendant of<br>Raghu's race, however, doubted the truthful words of Matali, thinking<br>this is another illusion produced by the Rakshasas&#8212;Vibhishana then<br>addressed him saying, 'This, O tiger among men, is no illusion of the<br>wicked Ravana! Ascend thou this chariot quickly, for this, O thou of<br>great effulgence, belongeth to Indra!' The descendant of Kakutstha then<br>cheerfully said unto Vibhishana, 'So be it', and riding on that car,<br>rushed wrathfully upon Ravana. And when Ravana, too, rushed against his<br>antagonist, a loud wail of woe was set up by the creatures of the Earth,<br>while the celestials in heaven sent forth a leonine roar accompanied by<br>beating of large drums. The encounter then that took place between the<br>Ten-necked Rakshasa and that prince of Raghu's race, was fierce in the<br>extreme. Indeed, that combat between them hath no parallel elsewhere. And<br>Rakshasa hurled at Rama a terrible javelin looking like Indra's<br>thunderbolt and resembling a Brahmana's curse on the point of<br>utterance.[104] Rama, however, quickly cut into fragments that javelin by<br>means of his sharp arrows. And beholding that most difficult feat, Ravana<br>was struck with fear. But soon his wrath was excited and the Ten-necked<br>hero began to shower on Rama whetted arrows by thousands and tens of<br>thousands and countless weapons of various kinds, such as rockets and<br>javelins and maces and battle-axes and darts of various kinds and<br>Shataghnis and whetted shafts. And beholding that terrible form of<br>illusion displayed by the Ten-necked Rakshasa, the monkeys fled in fear<br>in all directions. Then the descendant of Kakutstha, taking out of his<br>quiver an excellent arrow furnished with handsome wings and golden<br>feathers and a bright and beautiful head, fixed it on the bow with<br>Brahmastra mantra. And beholding that excellent arrow transformed by<br>Rama, with proper mantras into a Brahma weapon, the celestials and the<br>Gandharvas with Indra at their head, began to rejoice. And the gods and<br>the Danavas and the Kinnaras were led by the display of that Brahma<br>weapon to regard the life of their Rakshasa foe almost closed. Then Rama<br>shot that terrible weapon of unrivalled energy, destined to compass<br>Ravana's death, and resembling the curse of a Brahmana on the point of<br>utterance. And as soon, O Bharata, as that arrow was shot by Rama from<br>his bow drawn to a circle, the Rakshasa king with his chariot and<br>charioteer and horses blazed up, surrounded on all sides by a terrific<br>fire. And beholding Ravana slain by Rama of famous achievements, the<br>celestials, with the Gandharvas and the Charanas, rejoiced exceedingly.<br>And deprived of universal dominion by the energy of the Brahma weapon,<br>the five elements forsook the illustrious Ravana. And were consumed by<br>the Brahma weapon, the physical ingredients of Ravana's body. His flesh<br>and blood were all reduced to nothingness,&#8212;so that the ashes even could<br>not be seen.'"
