                            "Arjuna said, 'Then with rocks of the proportions of trees, there<br>commenced a mighty shower of crags; and this exercised me exceedingly.<br>And in that high encounter, I crushed (those crags) by swift-speeding<br>showers of arrows, issuing from Mahendra's weapon, like unto the<br>thunder-bolt itself. And when the rocks had been reduced to powder, there<br>was generated fire; and the rocky dust fell like unto masses of flames.<br>And when the showers of crags had been repelled, there happened near me a<br>mightier shower of water, having currents of the proportions of an axle.<br>And falling from the welkin, those thousands of powerful torrents covered<br>the entire firmament and the directions and the cardinal points. And on<br>account of the pouring of the shower, and of the blowing of the wind, and<br>of roaring of the Daityas, nothing could be perceived. And touching<br>heaven and the entire earth, and incessantly falling on the ground, the<br>showers bewildered me. Thereupon, I discharged that celestial weapon<br>which I had learnt from Indra&#8212;even the dreadful and flaming Visoshana:<br>and by that the water was dried up. And, O Bharata, when the rocky shower<br>had been destroyed, and the watery shower had been dried up, the Danavas<br>began to spread illusions of fire and wind. Then by aqueous appliances I<br>extinguished the flames; and by a mighty rock-issuing arm, resisted the<br>fury of the winds. And when these had been repelled, the Danavas,<br>irrepressible in battle, O foremost of the Bharata, simultaneously<br>created various illusions. And there happened a tremendous horrifying<br>shower of rocks and dreadful weapons of fire and wind. And that illusory<br>downpour afflicted me in fight. And then on all sides there appeared a<br>dense and thick darkness. And when the world had been enveloped in deep<br>and dense darkness, the steeds turned away, Matali fell off, and from his<br>hand the golden lash fell to the earth. And, O foremost of the Bharatas,<br>being frightened, he again and again cried, 'Where art thou?' And when he<br>had been stupefied, a terrible fear possessed me. And then in a hurry, he<br>spake unto me, saying, 'O Partha, for the sake of nectar, there had taken<br>place a mighty conflict between the gods and the demons. I had seen that<br>(encounter), O sinless one. And on the occasion of the destruction of<br>Samvara, there had occurred a dreadful and mighty contest. Nevertheless I<br>had acted as charioteer to the lord of the celestials. In the same way,<br>on the occasion of the slaying of Vritra, the steeds had been conducted<br>by me. And I had also beheld the high and terrific encounter with<br>Virochana's son, and, O Pandava, with Vala, and with Prahrada and with<br>others also. In these exceedingly dreadful battles, I was present; but, O<br>Pandu's son, never (before) had I lost my senses. Surely the Great-father<br>hath ordained the destruction of all creatures; for this battle cannot be<br>for any other purpose than destruction of the universe.' Having heard<br>these words of his, pacifying my perturbation by my own effort, I will<br>destroy the mighty energy of the illusion spread by the Danavas quoth I<br>unto the terrified Matali. Behold the might of my arms, and the power of<br>my weapons and of the bow, Gandiva. To-day even by (the help of)<br>illusion-creating arms, will I dispel this deep gloom and also this<br>horrible illusion of theirs. Do not fear, O charioteer. Pacify thyself.'<br>Having said this, O lord of men, I created for the good of the<br>celestials, an illusion of arms capable of bewildering all beings. And<br>when (their) illusion had been dispelled, some of the foremost amongst<br>the Asuras, of unrivalled prowess, again spread diverse kinds of<br>illusion. Thereupon, now (the world) displayed itself, and now it was<br>devoured by darkness; and now the world disappeared from view and now it<br>was submerged under water. And when it had brightened up. Matali, sitting<br>in front of the car, with the wellconducted steeds, began to range that<br>hair-erecting field. Then the fierce Nivata-Kavachas assailed me. And<br>finding my opportunity. I began to send them to the mansion of Yama.<br>Thereupon, in that conflict then raging, calculated to annihilate the<br>Nivata-Kavachas on a sudden, I could not see the Danavas concealed by<br>illusion."
