                            Vaisampayana said, "Beholding the Pandavas afflicted with anxiety and<br>depressed in spirits, Dhaumya, who resembled Vrihaspati, spake thus,<br>comforting them, 'O bull of the Bharata race, O sinless one, listen to me<br>as I mention certain sacred asylums and regions and tirthas and mountains<br>that are approved of by Brahmanas. O king, listen to me as I speak,<br>thyself with the daughter of Drupada and thy brothers, wilt, O lord of<br>men, be relieved from grief. And, O son of Pandu, by hearing only of<br>these places, thou wilt acquire merit. And by visiting them thou wilt<br>obtain merit a hundred times greater, O best of men! First, O king, I<br>will, so far as I recollect, speak of the beautiful eastern country, much<br>regarded, O Yudhishthira, by royal Rishis. In that direction, O Bharata<br>is a place called Naimisha which is regarded by the celestials. There in<br>that region are several sacred tirthas belonging to the gods. There also<br>is the sacred and beautiful Gomati which is adored by celestial Rishis<br>and there also in [possibly 'is'?&#8212;JBH] the sacrificial region of the<br>gods and the sacrificial stake of Surya. In that quarter also is that<br>best of hills called Gaya, which is sacred and much regarded by royal<br>ascetics. There on that hill, is the auspicious lake called Brahmasara<br>which is adored by celestial Rishis. It is for this that the ancients say<br>that one should wish for many sons, so that even one among them may visit<br>Gaya, celebrate the horse-sacrifice or give away a nila bull, and thereby<br>deliver ten generations of his race up and down. There, O monarch, is a<br>great river, and spot called Gayasira. In Gayasira is a banian, which is<br>called by the Brahmanas the Eternal banian, for the food that is offered<br>there to the Pitris becometh eternal, O exalted one! The great river that<br>floweth by the place is known by the name of Phalgu, and its waters are<br>all sacred. And, O bull among the Bharatas, there also, in that place, is<br>the Kausiki, whose basin abounds in various fruit and roots, and where<br>Viswamitra endued with wealth of asceticism acquired Brahmanahood.<br>Towards that direction also is the sacred Ganga, on whose banks<br>Bhagiratha celebrated many sacrifices with profuse gifts (to Brahmanas).<br>They say that in the country of Panchala, there is a wood called Utpala,<br>where Viswamitra of Kusika's race had performed sacrifices with his son,<br>and where beholding the relics of Viswamitra's superhuman power, Rama,<br>the son of Jamadagni, recited the praises of his ancestry. At Kamyaka,<br>Kusika's son had quaffed the Soma juice with Indra. Then abandoning the<br>Kshatriya order, he began to say, I am a Brahmana.' In that quarter, O<br>hero is the sacred confluence of Ganga and Yamuna which is celebrated<br>over the world. Holy and sin-destroying, that tirtha is much regarded by<br>the Rishis. It is there that the soul of all things, the Grandsire, had,<br>in olden days, performed his sacrifice, and it is for this, O chief of<br>the Bharata race, that the place hath come to be called Prayaga. In this<br>direction, O foremost of kings, lieth the excellent asylum of Agastya, O<br>monarch, and the forest called Tapasa, decked by many ascetics. And there<br>also is the great tirtha called Hiranyavinda on the Kalanjara hills, and<br>that best of mountains called Agastya, which is beautiful, sacred and<br>auspicious. In that quarter, O descendant of the Kuru race, is the<br>mountain called Mahendra, sacred to the illustrious Rama of the Bhrigu<br>race. There, O son of Kunti, the Grandsire performed sacrifices of yore.<br>There, O Yudhishthira, the sacred Bhagiratha entereth a lake and there<br>also, O king, is that sacred river known by the name of the<br>merit-bestowing Brahmasara, whose banks are inhabited by persons whose<br>sins have been washed away, and whose sight alone produceth merit. In<br>that direction also lieth the high-souled Matanga's excellent asylum,<br>called Kedara which is sacred and auspicious and celebrated over the<br>world. And there also is the mountain called Kundoda, which is so<br>delightful and abounding in fruits and roots and waters, and where the<br>king of the Nishadhas (Nala) had slaked his thirst and rested for a<br>while. In that quarter also is the delightful Deva-vana which is graced<br>by ascetics. There also are the rivers Vahuda and Nanda on the mountain's<br>crest. O mighty king, I have described unto thee all the tirthas and<br>sacred spots in the Eastern quarter. Do thou now hear of the sacred<br>tirthas, and rivers and mountains and holy spots in the other three<br>quarters!'"
