                            "Markandeya continued, 'He (Uktha) performed a severe penance lasting for<br>many years, with the view of having a pious son equal unto Brahma in<br>reputation. And when the invocation was made with the vyahriti hymns and<br>with the aid of the five sacred fires, Kasyapa, Vasistha, Prana, the son<br>of Prana, Chyavana, the son of Angiras, and Suvarchaka&#8212;there arose a<br>very bright energy (force) full of the animating (creative) principle,<br>and of five different colours. Its head was of the colour of the blazing<br>fire, its arms were bright like the sun and its skin and eyes were<br>golden-coloured and its feet, O Bharata, were black. Its five colours<br>were given to it by those five men by reason of their great penance. This<br>celestial being is therefore described as appertaining to five men, and<br>he is the progenitor of five tribes. After having performed a penance for<br>ten thousand years, that being of great ascetic merit produced the<br>terrible fire appertaining to the Pitris (manes) in order to begin the<br>work of creation, and from his head and mouth respectively he created<br>Vrihat and Rathantara (day and night) who quickly steal away (life, &c.).<br>He also created Siva from his navel, Indra from his might and wind and<br>fire from his soul, and from his two arms sprang the hymns Udatta and<br>Anudatta. He also produced the mind, and the five senses, and other<br>creatures. Having created these, he produced the five sons of the Pitris.<br>Of these Pranidhi was the son of Vrihadratha. Vrihadratha was the son of<br>Kasyapa. Bhanu was the godson of Chyavana, Saurabha, the son of<br>Suvarchaka, and Anudatta, the son of Prana. These twenty-five beings are<br>reputed (to have been created by him). Tapa also created fifteen other<br>gods who obstruct sacrifices[68]. They are Subhima, Bhima, Atibhima,<br>Bhimavala, Avala, Sumitra, Mitravana, Mitasina, Mitravardhana and<br>Mitradharaman,[69] and Surapravira, Vira, Suveka, Suravarchas and<br>Surahantri. These gods are divided into three classes of five each.<br>Located here in this world, they destroy the sacrifices of the gods in<br>heaven; they frustrate their objects and spoil their oblations of<br>clarified butter. They do this only to spite the sacred fires carrying<br>oblations to the gods. If the officiating priests are careful, they place<br>the oblations in their honour outside of the sacrificial altar. To that<br>particular place where the sacred fire may be placed, they cannot go.<br>They carry the oblation of their votaries by means of wings. When<br>appeased by hymns, they do not frustrate the sacrificial rites.<br>Vrihaduktha, another son of Tapa, belongs to the Earth. He is worshipped<br>here in this world by pious men performing Agnihotra sacrifices. Of the<br>son of Tapa who is known as Rathantara, it is said by officiating priests<br>that the sacrificial oblation offered in his honour is offered to<br>Mitravinda. The celebrated Tapa was thus very happy with his sons."
