                            Vaisampayana said, "These great warriors of the race of Bharata sojourned<br>like immortals in the great forest of Kamyaka, employed in hunting and<br>pleased with the sight of numerous wild tracts of country and wide<br>reaches of woodland, gorgeous with flowers blossoming in season. And the<br>sons of Pandu, each like unto Indra and the terror of his enemies, dwelt<br>there for some time. And one day those valiant men, the conquerors of<br>their foes, went about in all directions in search of game for feeding<br>the Brahmanas in their company, leaving Draupadi alone at the hermitage,<br>with the permission of the great ascetic Trinavindu, resplendent with<br>ascetic grandeur, and of their spiritual guide Dhaumya. Meanwhile, the<br>famous king of Sindhu, the son of Vriddhakshatra was, with a view to<br>matrimony, proceeding to the kingdom of Salwa, dressed in his best royal<br>apparel and accompanied by numerous princes. And the prince halted in the<br>woods of Kamyaka. And in that secluded place, he found the beautiful<br>Draupadi, the beloved and celebrated wife of the Pandavas, standing at<br>the threshold of the hermitage. And she looked grand in the superb beauty<br>of her form, and seemed to shed a lustre on the woodland around, like<br>lightning illuminating masses of dark clouds. And they who saw her asked<br>themselves, 'Is this an Apsara, or a daughter of the gods, or a celestial<br>phantom?' And with this thought, their hands also joined together. They<br>stood gazing on the perfect and faultless beauty of her form. And<br>Jayadratha, the king of Sindhu, and the son of Vriddhakshatra, struck<br>with amazement at the sight of that lady of faultless beauty, was seized<br>with an evil intention. And inflamed with desire, he said to the prince<br>named Kotika, 'Whose is this lady of faultless form? Is she of the human<br>kind? I have no need to marry if I can secure this exquisitely beautiful<br>creature. Taking her with me, I shall go back to my abode, Oh sir, and<br>enquire who she is and whence she has come and why also that delicate<br>being hath come into this forest beset with thorns. Will this ornament of<br>womankind, this slender-waisted lady of so much beauty, endued with<br>handsome teeth and large eyes, accept me as her lord? I shall certainly<br>regard myself successful, if I obtain the hand of this excellent lady.<br>Go, Kotika, and enquire who her husband may be.' Thus asked, Kotika,<br>wearing a kundala, jumped out of his chariot and came near her, as a<br>jackal approacheth a tigress, and spake unto her these words.'"
