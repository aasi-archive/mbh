                            "Dhaumya continued, 'I shall describe to thee those sacred spots capable<br>of producing merit that lie on the west, in the country of the Anarttas,<br>O Bharata, there, flows in a westward course the sacred river Narmada,<br>graced by Priyangu and mango trees, and engarlanded with thickest of<br>canes. All the tirthas and sacred spots, and rivers and woods and<br>foremost of mountains that are in the three worlds, all the gods with the<br>Grandsire, along with the Siddhas, the Rishis and the Charanas, O best of<br>the Kurus, always come, O Bharata, to bathe in the sacred waters of the<br>Narmada. And it hath been heard by us that the sacred asylum of the Muni<br>Visravas, had stood there, and that there was born the lord of treasures,<br>Kuvera, having men for his vehicles. There also is that foremost of<br>hills, the sacred and auspicious Vaidurya peak abounding with trees that<br>are green and which are always graced with fruit and flowers. O lord of<br>the earth, on the top of that mountain is a sacred tank decked with<br>full-blown lotus and resorted to by the gods and the Gandharvas. Many are<br>the wonders, O mighty monarch, that may be seen on that sacred mountain<br>which is like unto heaven itself and which is visited by celestial<br>Rishis. There, O subjugator of hostile cities, is the sacred river called<br>Viswamitra belonging to the royal sage of that name and which abounds, O<br>king, in many sacred tirthas. It was on the banks of this river, that<br>Yayati, the son of Nahusha, (fell from heaven) among the virtuous, and<br>obtained once more the eternal regions of the righteous. Here also are<br>the well-known lake called Punya, the mountain called Mainaka, and that<br>other mountain called Asita abounding in fruits and roots. And here also<br>is the sacred asylum of Kakshasena, and O Yudhishthira, the asylum of<br>Chyavana also, which is famed over every country, O son of Pandu! In that<br>spot, O exalted one, men attain to (ascetic) success without severe<br>austerities. Here also, O mighty king, is the region called Jamvumarga,<br>inhabited by birds and deer, and which constitutes the retreat of<br>ascetics with souls under control, O thou foremost of those that have<br>subdued their senses! Next lie the exceedingly sacred Ketumala, and<br>Medhya ever graced with ascetics, and, O lord of earth, Gangadwara, and<br>the well-known woods of Saindhava which are sacred and inhabited by the<br>regenerate ones. There also is the celebrated tank of the Grandsire,<br>called Pushkara, the favourite abode of the Vaikanasas, and Siddhas and<br>Rishis. Moved by the desire of obtaining its protection, the Creator sang<br>this verse at Pushkara, O chief of the Kurus and foremost of virtuous<br>men! If a person of pure soul purposes a pilgrimage to the Pushkaras in<br>imagination even, he becometh purged from all his sins and rejoiceth in<br>heaven!'"
