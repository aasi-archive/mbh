                            Vaisampayana said, "O thou foremost of the Bharata race, king Yudhisthira<br>then asked the illustrious Markandeya a difficult question about<br>morality, saying, 'I desire to hear, O holy one, about the high and<br>excellent virtue of women. I desire to hear from thee, O Brahmana,<br>discourse about the subtle truths of morality. O regenerate Rishi, O best<br>of men, the Sun, the Moon, the Wind, the Earth, the Fire, the father, the<br>mother, the preceptor&#8212;these and other objects ordained by the gods,<br>appear to us as Deities embodied! All these that are reverend ones are<br>worthy of our best regard. So also is the woman who adoreth one lord. The<br>worship that chaste wives offer unto their husbands appeareth to me to be<br>fraught with great difficulty. O adorable one, it behoveth thee to<br>discourse to us of the high and excellent virtue of chaste wives&#8212;of<br>wives who restraining all their senses and keeping their hearts under<br>complete control regard their husbands as veritable gods. O holy and<br>adorable one, all this appears to me to be exceedingly difficult of<br>accomplishment. O regenerate one, the worship that sons offer to their<br>mothers and fathers and that wives offer to their husbands, both seem to<br>me to be highly difficult. I do not behold anything that is more<br>difficult than the severe virtue of chaste women. O Brahmana, the duties<br>that women of good behaviour discharge with care and the conduct that is<br>pursued by good sons towards their fathers and mothers appear to me to be<br>most difficult of performance. Those women that are each devoted to but<br>one lord, they that always speak the truth, they that undergo a period of<br>gestation for full ten months&#8212;there is nothing, O Brahmana, that is more<br>difficult than that is done by these. O worshipful one, women bring forth<br>their offspring with great hazard to themselves and great pain and rear<br>their children, O bull among Brahmanas, with great affection! Those<br>persons also who being always engaged in acts of cruelty and there by<br>incurring general hatred, succeed yet in doing their duties accomplish<br>what, in my opinion, is exceedingly difficult. O regenerate one, tell me<br>the truths of the duties of the Kshatriya order. It is difficult, O<br>twice-born one, for those high-souled ones to acquire virtue who by the<br>duties of their order are obliged to do what is cruel. O holy one, thou<br>art capable of answering all questions; I desire to hear thee discourse<br>on all this. O thou foremost of Bhrigu's race, I desire to listen to all<br>this, waiting respectfully on thee, O thou of excellent vows!'<br><br>"Markandeya said, 'O thou foremost of the Bharata race, I will discourse<br>to thee on all this truly, however difficult of answer thy question may<br>be. Listen to me, therefore, as I speak unto thee. Some regard the mother<br>as superior and some the father. The mother, however, that bringeth forth<br>and some the father. The mother, however, that bringeth forth and reareth<br>up offspring what is more difficult. Fathers also, by ascetic penances by<br>worship of the gods, by adorations addressed to them, by bearing cold and<br>heat, by incantations and other means desire to have children. And having<br>by these painful expedients obtained children that are so difficult of<br>acquisition, they then, O hero, are always anxious about the future of<br>their sons and, O Bharata, both the father and the mother desire to see<br>in their sons fame and achievements and prosperity and offspring and<br>virtue. That son is virtuous who realises these hopes of his parents.<br>And, O great king, that son with whom the father and the mother are<br>gratified, achieveth eternal fame and eternal virtue both here and<br>thereafter. As regards women again, neither sacrifice nor sraddhas, nor<br>fasts are of any efficacy. By serving their husbands only they can win<br>heaven. O king, O Yudhishthira, remembering this alone, listen thou with<br>attention to the duties of chaste women."
