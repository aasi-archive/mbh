                            Vaisampayana continued, "O son of the Kuru race, while Dhaumya was<br>speaking thus, there arrived at the spot the Rishi Lomasa of great<br>energy. And the king, who was the eldest of Pandu's sons, with his<br>followers and those Brahmanas sat round the highly righteous one, like<br>celestials in heaven sitting round Sakra. And having received him duly,<br>Yudhishthira the just enquired after the reason of his arrival, and the<br>object also of his wanderings. Thus asked by Pandu's son, the illustrious<br>ascetic, well-pleased, replied in sweet words delighting the Pandavas,<br>'Travelling at will, O Kaunteya, over all the regions, I came to Sakra's<br>abode, and saw there the lord of the celestials. There, I saw thy heroic<br>brother capable of wielding the bow with his left hand, seated on the<br>same seat with Sakra. And beholding Partha on that seat I was greatly<br>astonished, O tiger among men! And the lord of the celestials then said<br>unto me, 'Go thou unto the sons of Pandu.' At the request, therefore, of<br>Indra as also of the high-souled son of Pritha have I come hither with<br>speed, desiring to see thee with thy younger brothers. O child, I will<br>relate what will please thee highly, O son of Pandu! Do thou listen to<br>it, O king, with Krishna and the Rishis that are with thee. O bull of the<br>Bharata race, Partha hath obtained from Rudra that incomparable weapon<br>for the acquisition of which thou hadst sent him to heaven. That fierce<br>weapon, known by the name of Brahma-sira which arose after Amrita, and<br>which Rudra had obtained by means of ascetic austerities, hath been<br>acquired by Arjuna together with the Mantras for hurling and withdrawing<br>it, and the rites of expiation and revival. And, O Yudhishthira, Arjuna<br>of immeasurable prowess hath also acquired Vajras and Dandas and other<br>celestial weapons from Yama and Kuvera and Varuna and Indra, O son of the<br>Kuru race! And he hath also thoroughly learnt music, both vocal and<br>instrumental, and dancing and proper recitation of the Saman (Veda) from<br>Vishwavasu's son. And having thus acquired weapons and mastered the<br>Gandharva Veda, thy third brother Vibhatsu liveth happily (in heaven).<br>Listen to me, O Yudhishthira, for I shall now deliver to thee the message<br>of that foremost of celestials. He hath commanded me saying, "Thou wilt,<br>no doubt, go to the world of men. O best of Brahmanas, tell thou<br>Yudhishthira these words of mine. Soon will thy brother Arjuna come to<br>thee, having acquired arms and accomplished a great deed for the<br>celestials that is incapable of being accomplished by themselves. Do thou<br>meanwhile devote thyself to ascetic austerities, with thy brothers. There<br>is nothing superior to asceticism, and it is by asceticism that a person<br>achieveth great results. And, O bull of the Bharata race, well do I know<br>that Karna is endued with great ardour and energy and strength and<br>prowess that is incapable of being baffled. Well do I know that, skilled<br>in fierce conflict, he hath not his rival in battle; that he is a mighty<br>bowman, a hero deft in the use of fierce weapons and cased in the best of<br>mail. Well do I know that that exalted son of Aditya resembleth the son<br>of Maheswara himself. Well do I also know the high natural prowess of the<br>broad-shouldered Arjuna. In battle Karna is not equal unto even a<br>sixteenth part of Pritha's son. And as for the fear of Karna which is in<br>thy heart, O repressor of foes, I shall dispel when Savyasachin will have<br>left heaven. And as regards thy purpose, O hero, to set out on a<br>pilgrimage to tirthas, the great Rishi Lomasa will, without doubt, speak<br>unto thee. And whatever that regenerate Rishi will relate unto thee<br>touching the merits of asceticism and tirthas, thou shouldst receive with<br>respect and not otherwise!'"
