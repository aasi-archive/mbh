                            "Vrihadaswa continued, 'Having destroyed that hunter Damayanti of eyes<br>like lotus leaves, went onwards through that fearful and solitary forest<br>ringing with the chirp of crickets. And it abounded with lions, and<br>leopards, and Rurus and tigers, and buffaloes, and bears and deer. And it<br>swarmed with birds of various species, and was infested by thieves and<br>mlechchha tribes. And it contained Salas, and bamboos and Dhavas, and<br>Aswatthas, and Tindukas and Ingudas, and Kinsukas, and Arjunas, and<br>Nimvas, and Tinisas and Salmalas, and Jamvus, and mango trees, and<br>Lodhras, and the catechu, and the cane, and Padmakas, and Amalahas, and<br>Plakshas, and Kadamvas, and Udumvaras and Vadaris, and Vilwas, and<br>banians, and Piyalas, and palms, and date-trees, and Haritakas and<br>Vibhitakas. And the princess of Vidarbha saw many mountains containing<br>ores of various kinds, and groves resounding with the notes of winged<br>choirs, and many glens of wondrous sight, and many rivers and lakes and<br>tanks and various kinds of birds and beasts. And she saw numberless<br>snakes and goblins and Rakshasas of grim visage, and pools and tanks and<br>hillocks, and brooks and fountains of wonderful appearance. And the<br>princess of Vidarbha saw there herds of buffaloes. And boars, and bears<br>as well as serpents of the wilderness. And safe in virtue and glory and<br>good fortune and patience, Damayanti wandered through those woods alone,<br>in search of Nala. And the royal daughter of Bhima, distressed only at<br>her separation from her lord, was not terrified at aught in that fearful<br>forest. And, O king, seating herself down upon a stone and filled with<br>grief, and every limb of hers trembling with sorrow on account of her<br>husband, she began to lament thus: 'O king of the Nishadhas, O thou of<br>broad chest and mighty arms, whither hast thou gone, O king, leaving me<br>in this lone forest? O hero, having performed the Aswamedha and other<br>sacrifices, with gifts in profusion (unto the Brahmanas), why hast thou,<br>O tiger among men, played false with me alone? O best of men, O thou of<br>great splendour, it behoveth thee. O auspicious one, to remember what<br>thou didst declare before me, O bull among kings! And, O monarch, it<br>behoveth thee also to call to mind what the sky-ranging swans spake in<br>thy presence and in mine. O tiger among men, the four Vedas in all their<br>extent, with the Angas and the Upangas, well-studied, on one side, and<br>one single truth on the other, (are equal). Therefore, O slayer of foes,<br>it behoveth thee, O lord of men, to make good what thou didst formerly<br>declare before me. Alas, O hero! warrior! O Nala! O sinless one being<br>thine, I am about to perish in this dreadful forest. Oh! wherefore dost<br>thou not answer me? This terrible lord of the forest, of grim visage and<br>gaping jaws, and famishing with hunger, filleth me with fright. Doth it<br>not behove thee to deliver me? Thou wert wont to say always, 'Save thee<br>there existeth not one dear unto me.' O blessed one, O king, do thou now<br>make good thy words so spoken before. And, O king, why dost thou not<br>return an answer to thy beloved wife bewailing and bereft of sense,<br>although thou lovest her, being loved in return? O king of the earth, O<br>respected one, O represser of foes, O thou of large eyes, why dost thou<br>not regard me, emaciated, and distressed and pale, and discoloured, and<br>clad in a half piece of cloth, and alone, and weeping, and lamenting like<br>one forlorn, and like unto a solitary doe separated from the herd? O<br>illustrious sovereign, it is, I, Damayanti, devoted to thee, who, alone<br>in this great forest, address thee. Wherefore, then, dost thou not reply<br>unto me? Oh, I do not behold thee today on this mountain, O chief of men,<br>O thou of noble birth and character with every limb possesed of grace! In<br>this terrible forest, haunted by lions and tigers, O king of the<br>Nishadhas, O foremost of men, O enhancer of my sorrows, (Wishing to know)<br>whether thou art lying down, or sitting, or standing, or gone, whom shall<br>I ask, distressed and woe-stricken on thy account, saying, 'Hast thou<br>seen in this woods the royal Nala?' Of whom shall I in this forest<br>enquire alter the departed Nala, handsome and of high soul, and the<br>destroyer of hostile arrays? From whom shall I today hear the sweet<br>words, viz., 'That royal Nala, of eyes like lotus-leaves, whom thou<br>seekest, is even here?' Yonder cometh the forest-king, that tiger of<br>graceful mien, furnished with four teeth and prominent cheeks. Even him<br>will I accost fearlessly: Thou art the lord of all animals, and of this<br>forest the king. Know me for Damayanti, the daughter of the king of the<br>Vidarbhas, and the wife of Nala, destroyer of foes, and the king of the<br>Nishadhas. Distressed and woe-stricken, I am seeking my husband alone in<br>these woods. Do thou, O king of beasts, comfort me (with news of Nala) if<br>thou hast seen him. Or, O lord of the forest, if thou cannot speak of<br>Nala, do thou, then, O best of beasts, devour me, and free me from this<br>misery. Alas! hearing my plaintive appeal in the wilderness, this king of<br>mountains, this high and sacred hill, crested with innumerable [...?-JBH]<br>rolleth towards the sea. Let me, then, for tidings of the king, ask this<br>king of mountains, this high and sacred hill, crested with innumerable<br>heaven-kissing and many-hued and beauteous peaks, and abounding in<br>various ores, and decked with gems of diverse kings, and rising like a<br>banner over this broad forest, and ranged by lions and tigers and<br>elephants and boars and bears and stags, and echoing all around with (the<br>notes of) winged creatures of various species, and adorned with kinsukas<br>and Asokas and Vakulas and Punnagas, with blossoming Karnikaras, and<br>Dhavas and Plakshas, and with streams haunted by waterfowls of every<br>kind, and abounding in crested summits, O sacred one! O best of<br>mountains! O thou of wondrous sight! O celebrated hill! O refuge (of the<br>distressed)! O highly auspicious one! I bow to thee, O pillar of the<br>earth! Approaching, I bow to thee. Know me for a king's daughter, and a<br>king's daughter-in-law, and king's consort, Damayanti by name that lord<br>of earth who ruleth the Vidarbhas, that mighty warrior-king Bhima by<br>name, who protecteth the four orders, is my sire. That best of kings<br>celebrated the Rajasuya and Aswamedha sacrifices, with profuse gifts to<br>the Brahmanas. Possessed of beautiful and large eyes, distinguished for<br>devotion to the Vedas, of unblemished character, truth-telling, devoid of<br>guile, gentle, endued with prowess, lord of immense wealth, versed in<br>morality, and pure, he having vanquished all his foes, effectually<br>protecteth the inhabitants of Vidarbha. Know me, O holy one, for his<br>daughter, thus come to thee. That best of men&#8212;the celebrated ruler of<br>the Nishadha&#8212;known by the name of Virasena of high fame, was my<br>father-in-law. The son of that king, heroic and handsome and possessed of<br>energy incapable of being baffled, who ruleth well the kingdom which hath<br>descended to him from his father, is named Nala. Know, O mountain, that<br>of that slayer of foes, called also Punyasloka, possessed of the<br>complexion of gold, and devoted to the Brahmanas, and versed in the<br>Vedas, and gifted with eloquence,&#8212;of that righteous and Soma-quaffing<br>and fire-adoring king, who celebrateth sacrifices and is liberal and<br>warlike and who adequately chastiseth (criminals), I am the innocent<br>spouse&#8212;the chief of his queens&#8212;standing before thee. Despoiled of<br>prosperity and deprived of (the company of my) husband without a<br>protector, and afflicted with calamity, hither have I come, O best of<br>mountains, seeking my husband. Hast thou, O foremost of mountains, with<br>thy hundreds of peaks towering (into the sky) seen king Nala in this<br>frightful forest? Hast thou seen my husband, that ruler of the Nishadhas,<br>the illustrious Nala, with the tread of a mighty elephant, endued with<br>intelligence, long-armed, and of fiery energy, possessed of prowess and<br>patience and courage and high fame? Seeing me bewailing alone,<br>overwhelmed with sorrow, wherefore, O best of mountains, dost thou not<br>today soothe me with thy voice, as thy own daughter in distress? O hero,<br>O warrior of prowess, O thou versed in every duty, O thou adhering to<br>truth&#8212;O lord of the earth, if thou art in this forest, then, O king,<br>reveal thyself unto me. Oh, when shall I again hear the voice of Nala,<br>gentle and deep as that of the clouds, that voice, sweet as Amrita, of<br>the illustrious king, calling me Vidharva's daughter, with accents<br>distinct, and holy, and musical as the chanting of the Vedas and rich,<br>and soothing all my sorrows. O king, I am frightened. Do thou, O virtuous<br>one, comfort me.'<br><br>"Having addressed that foremost of mountain thus, Damayanti then went in<br>a northerly direction. And having proceeded three days and nights, that<br>best of women came to an incomparable penance grove of ascetics,<br>resembling in beauty a celestial grove. And the charming asylum she<br>beheld was inhabited and adorned by ascetics like Vasishtha and Bhrigu<br>and Atri, self-denying and strict in diet, with minds under control,<br>endued with holiness, some living on water, some on air, and some on<br>(fallen) leaves, with passions in check, eminently blessed, seeking the<br>way to heaven, clad in barks of trees and deer-skins, and with senses<br>subdued. And beholding that hermitage inhabited by ascetics, and<br>abounding in herds of deer and monkeys, Damayanti was cheered. And that<br>best of women, the innocent and blessed Damayanti, with graceful<br>eye-brows, and long tresses, with lovely hips and deep bosom, and face<br>graced with fine teeth and with fine black and large eyes, in her<br>brightness and glory entered that asylum. And saluting those ascetics<br>grown old in practising austerities, she stood in an attitude of<br>humility. And the ascetics living in that forest, said, 'Welcome!' And<br>those men of ascetic wealth, paying her due homage, said, 'Sit ye down,<br>and tell us what we may do for thee.' That best of women replied unto<br>them, saying, 'Ye sinless and eminently blessed ascetics, is it well with<br>your austerities, and sacrificial fire, and religious observances, and<br>the duties of your own order? And is it well with the beasts and birds of<br>this asylum? And they answered, 'O beauteous and illustrious lady,<br>prosperity attendeth us in every respect. But, O thou of faultless limbs,<br>tell us who thou art, and what thou seekest. Beholding thy beauteous form<br>and thy bright splendour, we have been amazed. Cheer up and mourn not.<br>Tell us, O blameless and blessed one, art thou the presiding deity of<br>this forest, or of this mountain, or of this river?' Damayanti replied<br>unto those ascetics, saying, 'O Brahmanas, I am not the goddess of this<br>forest, or of this mountain, or of this stream. O Rishis of ascetic<br>wealth, know that I am a human being. I will relate my history in detail.<br>Do ye listen to me. There is a king&#8212;the mighty ruler of the<br>Vidarbhas&#8212;Bhima by name. O foremost of regenerate ones, know me to be<br>his daughter. The wise ruler of the Nishadhas, Nala by name, of great<br>celebrity, heroic, and ever victorious in battle, and learned, is my<br>husband. Engaged in the worship of the gods, devoted to the twice-born<br>ones, the guardian of the line of the Nishadhas, of mighty energy,<br>possessed of great strength, truthful, conversant with all duties, wise,<br>unwavering in promise, the crusher of foes, devout, serving the gods,<br>graceful, the conqueror of hostile towns, that foremost of kings, Nala by<br>name, equal in splendour unto the lord of celestials, the slayer of foes,<br>possessed of large eyes, and a hue resembling the full moon, is my<br>husband. The celebrator of great sacrifices, versed in the Vedas and<br>their branches, the destroyer of enemies in battle, and like unto the sun<br>and the moon in splendour, is he. That king devoted to truth and religion<br>was summoned to dice by certain deceitful persons of mean mind and<br>uncultured soul and of crooked ways, and skilful in gambling, and was<br>deprived of wealth and kingdom. Know that I am the wife of that bull<br>among kings, known to all by the name of Damayanti, anxious to find out<br>my (missing) lord. In sadness of heart am I wandering among woods, and<br>mountains, and lakes, and rivers, and tanks and forests, in search of<br>that husband of mine&#8212;Nala, skilled in battle, high-souled, and<br>well-versed in the use of weapons, O hath king Nala, the lord of the<br>Nishadhas, come to this delightful asylum of your holy selves? It is for<br>him, O Brahmanas, that I have come to this dreary forest full of terrors<br>and haunted by tigers and other beasts. If I do not see king Nala within<br>a few days and nights, I shall seek my good by renouncing this body. Of<br>what use is my life without that bull among men? How shall I live<br>afflicted with grief on account of my husband?'<br><br>Unto Bhima's daughter, Damayanti, lamenting forlorn in that forest, the<br>truth-telling ascetics replied, saying, 'O blessed and beauteous one, we<br>see by ascetic power that the future will bring happiness to thee, and<br>that thou wilt soon behold Naishadha. O daughter of Bhima, thou wilt<br>behold Nala, the lord of the Nishadhas, the slayer of foes, and the<br>foremost of the virtuous freed from distress. And O blessed lady, thou<br>wilt behold the king&#8212;thy lord&#8212;freed from all sins and decked with all<br>kinds of gems, and ruling the selfsame city, and chasting his enemies,<br>and striking terror into the hearts of foes, and gladdening the hearts of<br>friends, and crowned with every blessing.'<br><br>"'Having spoken unto that princess&#8212;the beloved queen of Nala&#8212;the<br>ascetics with their sacred fires and asylum vanished from sight. And<br>beholding that mighty wonder, the daughter-in-law of king Virasena,<br>Damayanti of faultless limbs, was struck with amazement. And she asked<br>herself, 'Was it a dream that I saw? What an occurrence hath taken place!<br>Where are all those ascetics? And where is that asylum? Where, further,<br>is that delightful river of sacred waters&#8212;the resort of diverse kinds of<br>fowls? And where, again, are those charming trees decked with fruits and<br>flowers?' And after thinking so for some time, Bhima's daughter,<br>Damayanti of sweet smiles melancholy and afflicted with grief on account<br>of her lord, lost the colour of her face (again). And going to another<br>part of the wood, she saw an Asoka tree. And approaching that first of<br>trees in the forest, so charming with blossoms and its load of foliage,<br>and resounding with the notes of birds, Damayanti, with tears in her eyes<br>and accents choked in grief, began to lament, saying, 'Oh, this graceful<br>tree in the heart of the forest, decked in flowers, looketh beautiful,<br>like a charming king of hills. O beauteous Asoka, do thou speedily free<br>me from grief. Hast thou seen king Nala, the slayer of foes and the<br>beloved husband of Damayanti,&#8212;freed from fear and grief and obstacles?<br>Hast thou seen my beloved husband, the ruler of the Nishadhas, clad in<br>half a piece of cloth, with delicate skin, that hero afflicted with woe<br>and who hath come into this wilderness? O Asoka tree, do thou free me<br>from grief! O Asoka, vindicate thy name, for Asoka meaneth destroyer of<br>grief. And going round that tree thrice, with an afflicted heart, that<br>best of women, Bhima's daughter, entered a more terrible part of the<br>forest. And wandering in quest of her lord, Bhima's daughter beheld many<br>trees and streams and delightful mountains, and many beasts and birds,<br>and caves, and precipices, and many rivers of wonderful appearance. And<br>as she proceeded she came upon a broad way where she saw with wonder a<br>body of merchants, with their horses and elephants, landing on the banks<br>of a river, full of clear and cool water, and lovely and charming to<br>behold, and broad, and covered with bushes of canes, and echoing with the<br>cries of cranes and ospreys and Chakravakas, and abounding in tortoises<br>and alligators and fishes, and studded with innumerable islets. And as<br>soon as as she saw that caravan, the beauteous and celebrated wife of<br>Nala, wild like a maniac, oppressed with grief, clad in half a garment,<br>lean and pale and smutted, and with hair covered with dust, drew near and<br>entered into its midst. And beholding her, some fled in fear, and some<br>became extremely anxious, and some cried aloud, and some laughed at her,<br>and some hated her. And some, O Bharata, felt pity for, and even<br>addressed, her, saying, 'O blessed one, who art thou, and whose? What<br>seekest thou in woods? Seeing thee here we have been terrified. Art thou<br>human? Tell us truly, O blessed one if thou art the goddess of this wood<br>or of this mountain or of the points of the heaven. We seek thy<br>protection. Art thou a female Yaksha, or a female Rakshasa, or a<br>celestial damsel? O thou of faultless features, do thou bless us wholly<br>and protect us. And, O blessed one, do thou so act that his caravan may<br>soon go hence in prosperity and that the welfare of all of us may be<br>secured.' Thus addressed by that caravan, the princess Damayanti, devoted<br>to her husband and oppressed by the calamity that had befallen her,<br>answered, saying, 'O leader of the caravan, ye merchants, ye youths, old<br>men, and children, and ye that compose this caravan, know me for a human<br>being. I am the daughter of a king, and the daughter in-law of a king,<br>and the consort also of a king, eager for the sight of my lord. The ruler<br>of the Vidarbhas is my father, and my husband is the lord of the<br>Nishadhas, named Nala. Even now I am seeking that unvanquished and<br>blessed one. If ye have chanced to see my beloved one, king Nala, that<br>tiger among men, that destroyer of hostile hosts, O tell me quick.'<br>Thereupon the leader of that great caravan, named Suchi, replied unto<br>Damayanti of faultless limbs, saying, 'O blessed one, listen to my words.<br>O thou of sweet smiles, I am a merchant and the leader of this caravan. O<br>illustrious lady, I have not seen any man of the name of Nala. In this<br>extensive forest uninhabited by men, there are only elephants and<br>leopards and buffaloes, and tigers and bears and other animals. Except<br>thee, I have not met with any man or woman here, so help us now<br>Manibhadra, the king of Yakshas!' Thus addressed by them she asked those<br>merchants as well as the leader of the host saying, 'It behoveth you to<br>tell me whither this caravan is bound.' The leader of the band said, 'O<br>daughter of a great king, for the purpose of profit this caravan is bound<br>direct for the city of Suvahu, the truth-telling ruler of the Chedis.'"
