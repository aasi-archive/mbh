                            "Lomasa continued, 'Agastya then, O son of the Kuru race, went to king<br>Srutarvan who was regarded as richer than other kings, to beg for wealth.<br>And that monarch, learning of the arrival of the pot-born Rishi on the<br>frontiers of his kingdoms, went out with his ministers and received the<br>holy man with respect. And the king duly offering the Arghya in the first<br>instance, submissively and with joined hands enquired then after the<br>reason of the Rishi's arrival. And Agastya answered saying, O lord of the<br>earth, know that I have come to thee, desirous of wealth. Give me a<br>portion according to thy ability and without doing injury to others.'<br><br>"Lomasa continued, 'The king, then, representing unto the Rishi the<br>equality of his expenditure and income, said, 'O learned one, take thou<br>from my possessions the wealth thou pleasest.' Beholding, however, the<br>equality of that monarch's expenditure with income, the Rishi who always<br>saw both sides with equal eyes, thought that if he took anything under<br>the circumstances, his act would result in injury to creatures. Taking,<br>therefore, Srutarvan with him, the Rishi went to Vradhnaswa. The latter,<br>hearing of their arrival on his frontiers, received them duly. And<br>Vradhnaswa also offered them the Arghyas and water to wash their feet.<br>And the monarch, with their permission, then enquired after the reason of<br>their coming. And Agastya said, 'O lord of earth, know that we have come<br>to thee desirous of wealth. Give us what thou canst, without doing injury<br>to others.'"<br><br>"Lomasa continued, 'That monarch then represented unto them the equality<br>of his expenditure and income, and said, 'Knowing this, take ye what ye<br>desire.' The Rishi, however, who saw both sides with equal eyes,<br>beholding the equality of that monarch's income with expenditure, thought<br>that if he took anything under the circumstances, his act would result in<br>injury to all creatures. Agastya and Srutarvan, with king Vradhnaswa then<br>went to Purokutsa's son, Trasadasyu, of enormous wealth. The high-souled<br>Trasadasyu, learning of their arrival on the confines of his kingdom went<br>out, O king, and received them well. And that best of monarchs in<br>Ikshvaku's line, having worshipped all of them duly, enquired after the<br>reason of their arrival. And Agastya answered, 'O lord of earth, know<br>that we have all come to thee, desirous of wealth. Give us what you can,<br>without injuring others.'"<br><br>"Lomasa continued, 'That monarch then, represented unto them the equality<br>of his income with expenditure, and said, 'Knowing this, take ye what ye<br>desire.' Beholding, however, the equality of that monarch's expenditure<br>with income, the Rishi who saw both sides with equal eyes, thought that<br>if he took anything under the circumstances, his act would result in<br>injury to all creatures. Then, O monarch, all those kings looking at one<br>another, together spoke unto the Rishis saying, 'O Brahmana, there is a<br>Danava of the name Ilwala who of all persons on earth, is possessed of<br>enormous wealth. Let us all approach him to-day and beg wealth of him.'"<br><br>"Lomasa continued, 'This suggestion, O king, of begging wealth of Ilwala<br>appeared to them to be proper. And, O monarch, all of them went together<br>to Ilwala after this!'"
