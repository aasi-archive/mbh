                            Then Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu, said to the Brahmana, Markandeya,<br>'Do thou now narrate the history of Vaivaswata Manu?<br><br>"Markandeya replied, 'O king, O foremost of men, there was a powerful and<br>great Rishi of the name of Manu. He was the son of Vivaswan and was equal<br>unto Brahma in glory. And he far excelled his father and grandfather in<br>strength, in power, in fortune, as also in religious austerities. And<br>standing on one leg and with uplifted hand, that lord of men did severe<br>penance in the jujube forest called Visala. And there with head downwards<br>and with steadfast eyes he practised the rigid and severe penance for ten<br>thousand years. And one day, whilst he was practising austerities there<br>with wet clothes on and matted hair on head, a fish approaching the banks<br>of the Chirini, addressed him thus, 'Worshipful sir, I am a helpless<br>little fish, I am afraid of the large ones; therefore, do thou, O great<br>devotee, think it worth thy while to protect me from them; especially as<br>this fixed custom is well established amongst us that the strong fish<br>always preys upon the weak ones. Therefore do thou think it fit to save<br>me from being drowned in this sea of terrors! I shall requite thee for<br>thy good offices.' On hearing these words from the fish, Vaivaswata Manu<br>was overpowered with pity and he took out the fish from the water with<br>his own hands. And the fish which had a body glistening like the rays of<br>the moon when taken out of the water was put back in an earthen<br>water-vessel. And thus reared that fish O king, grew up in size and Manu<br>tended it carefully like a child. And after a long while, it became so<br>large in size, that there was no room for it in that vessel. And then<br>seeing Manu (one day), it again addressed these words to him, 'Worshipful<br>sir, do thou appoint some better habitation for me.' And then the<br>adorable Manu, the conqueror of hostile cities, took it out of that<br>vessel and carried it to a large tank and placed it there. And there<br>again the fish grew for many a long year. And although the tank was two<br>yojanas in length and one yojana in width, even there, O lotus-eyed son<br>of Kunti and ruler of men, was no room for the fish to play about! And<br>beholding Manu it said again, 'O pious and adorable father, take me to<br>the Ganga, the favourite spouse of the Ocean so that I may live there; or<br>do as thou listest. O sinless one, as I have grown to this great bulk by<br>thy favour I shall do thy bidding cheerfully.' Thus asked the upright and<br>continent and worshipful Manu took the fish to the river Ganga and he put<br>it into the river with his own hands. And there, O conqueror of thy<br>enemies, the fish again grew for some little time and then beholding<br>Manu, it said again, 'O lord, I am unable to move about in the Ganga on<br>account of my great body; therefore, worshipful sir, do thou please take<br>me quickly to the sea!' O son of Pritha, Manu then taking it out of the<br>Ganga, carried it to the sea and consigned it there. And despite its<br>great bulk, Manu transported it easily and its touch and smell were also<br>pleasant to him. And when it was thrown into the sea by Manu, it said<br>these words to him with a smile, 'O adorable being, thou hast protected<br>me with special care; do thou now listen to me as to what thou shouldst<br>do in the fulness of time! O fortunate and worshipful sir, the<br>dissolution of all this mobile and immobile world is nigh at hand. The<br>time for the purging of this world is now ripe. Therefore do I now<br>explain what is good for thee! The mobile and immobile divisions of the<br>creation, those that have the power of locomotion, and those that have it<br>not, of all these the terrible doom hath now approached. Thou shall build<br>a strong massive ark and have it furnished with a long rope. On that must<br>thou ascend, O great Muni, with the seven Rishis and take with thee all<br>the different seeds which were enumerated by regenerate Brahmanas in days<br>of yore, and separately and carefully must thou preserve them therein.<br>And whilst there, O beloved of the Munis, thou shall wait for me, and I<br>shall appear to thee like a horned animal, and thus, O ascetic, shall<br>thou recognise me! And I shall now depart, and thou shall act according<br>to my instructions, for, without my assistance, thou canst not save<br>thyself from that fearful flood.' Then Manu said unto the fish, 'I do not<br>doubt all that thou hast said, O great one! Even so shall I act!' And<br>giving instructions to each other, they both went away. And Manu then, O<br>great and powerful king and conqueror of thy enemies, procured all the<br>different seeds as directed by the fish, and set sail in an excellent<br>vessel on the surging sea. And then, O lord of the earth, he bethought<br>himself of that fish. And the fish too, O conqueror of thy enemies and<br>foremost scion of Bharata's race, knowing his mind, appeared there with<br>horns on his head. And then, O tiger among men, beholding in the ocean<br>that horned fish emerging like a rock in the form of which he had been<br>before appraised, he lowered the ropy noose on its head. And fastened by<br>the noose, the fish, O king and conqueror of hostile cities, towed the<br>ark with great force through the salt waters. And it conveyed them in<br>that vessel on the roaring and billow beaten sea. And, O conqueror of thy<br>enemies and hostile cities, tossed by the tempest on the great ocean, the<br>vessel reeled about like a drunken harlot. And neither land nor the four<br>cardinal points of the compass, could be distinguished.<br><br>And there was water everywhere and the waters covered the heaven and the<br>firmament also. And, O bull of Bharata's race, when the world was thus<br>flooded, none but Manu, the seven Rishis and the fish could be seen. And,<br>O king, the fish diligently dragged the boat through the flood for many a<br>long year and then, O descendant of Kuru and ornament of Bharata's race,<br>it towed the vessel towards the highest peak of the Himavat. And, O<br>Bharata, the fish then told those on the vessel to tie it to the peak of<br>the Himavat. And hearing the words of the fish they immediately tied the<br>boat on that peak of the mountain and, O son of Kunti and ornament of<br>Bharata's race, know that that high peak of the Himavat is still called<br>by the name of Naubandhana (the harbour). Then the fish addressing the<br>associated Rishis told them these words, 'I am Brahma, the Lord of all<br>creatures; there is none greater than myself. Assuming the shape of a<br>fish, I have saved you from this cataclysm. Manu will create (again) all<br>beings&#8212;gods, Asuras and men, all those divisions of creation which have<br>the power of locomotion and which have it not. By practicing severe<br>austerities he will acquire this power, and with my blessing, illusion<br>will have no power over him.'<br><br>"So saying the fish vanished instantly. And Vaivaswata Manu himself<br>became desirous of creating the world. In this work of creation illusion<br>overtook him and he, therefore, practised great asceticism. And endowed<br>with ascetic merit, Manu, O ornament of Bharata's race, again set about<br>his work of creating all beings in proper and exact order. This story<br>which I have narrated to thee and the hearing of which destroyeth all<br>sin, is celebrated as the Legend of the Fish. And the man who listeneth<br>every day to this primeval history of Manu, attaineth happiness and all<br>other objects of desire and goeth to heaven."
