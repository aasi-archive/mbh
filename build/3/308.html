                            Vaisampayana said, "And when the king of the celestials presented himself<br>in the guise of a Brahmana, beholding him, Kama said, 'Welcome!' And not<br>knowing his intention, Adhiratha's son addressed the Brahmana, saying,<br>'Of a necklace of gold, and beauteous damsels, and villages with plenty<br>of kine, which shall I give thee?' Thereupon the Brahmana replied, 'I ask<br>thee not to give me either a necklace of gold, or fair damsels, or any<br>other agreeable object. To those do thou give them that ask for them. If,<br>O sinless one, thou art sincere in thy vow, then wilt thou, cutting off<br>(from thy person) this coat of mail born with thy body, and these<br>ear-rings also, bestow them on me! I desire, O chastiser of foes, that<br>thou mayst speedily give me these; for, this one gain of mine will be<br>considered as superior to every other gain!' Hearing these words, Kama,<br>said, 'O Brahmana, I will give thee homestead land, and fair damsels, and<br>kine, and fields; but my mail and ear-rings I am unable to give thee!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Although thus urged with various words by Karna,<br>still, O chief of the Bharata race, that Brahmana did not ask for any<br>other boon. And although Karna sought to pacify him to the best of his<br>power, and worshipped him duly, yet that best of Brahmanas did not ask<br>for any other boon. And when that foremost of Brahmanas did not ask for<br>any other boon, Radha's son again spake unto him with a smile, 'My mail,<br>O regenerate one, hath been born with my body, and this pair of ear-rings<br>hath arisen from Amrita. It is for these that I am unslayable in the<br>worlds. Therefore, I cannot part with them. Do thou, O bull among<br>Brahmanas, accept from me the entire kingdom of the earth, rid of enemies<br>and full of prosperity! O foremost of regenerate ones, if I am deprived<br>of my ear-rings, and the mail born with my body, I shall be liable to be<br>vanquished by the foes!'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "When the illustrious slayer of Paka refused to<br>ask for any other boon, Kama with a smile again addressed him, saying, 'O<br>god of gods, even before this, I had recognised thee, O Lord! O Sakra, it<br>is not proper for me to confer on thee any unprofitable boon, for thou<br>art the very lord of the celestials! On the contrary, being as thou art<br>the Creator and lord of all beings, it is thou that shouldst confer boons<br>on me! If, O god, I give thee this coat of mail and ear-rings, then I am<br>sure to meet with destruction, and thou shalt also undergo ridicule!<br>Therefore, O Sakra, take my earrings and excellent mail in exchange for<br>something conferred by thee on me! Otherwise, I will not bestow them on<br>thee!' Thereupon Sakra replied, 'Even before I had come to thee, Surya<br>had known of my purpose and without doubt, it is he that hath unfolded<br>everything unto thee! O Karna, be it as thou wishest! O son, except the<br>thunder-bolt alone, tell me what it is that thou desirest to have!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Hearing these words of Indra, Karna was filled<br>with delight and seeing that his purpose was about to be accomplished he<br>approached Vasava, and intent upon obtaining a dart incapable of being<br>baffled, he addressed Indra, saying, 'Do thou, O Vasava, in exchange for<br>my coat of mail and ear-rings, give me a dart incapable of being baffled,<br>and competent to destroy hosts of enemies when arrayed in order of<br>battle!' Thereupon, O ruler of earth, fixing his mind for a moment on the<br>dart (for bringing it there), Vasava thus spake unto Karna, 'Do thou give<br>me thy ear-rings, and the coat of mail born with thy body, and in return<br>take this dart on these terms! When I encounter the Daitya in battle,<br>this dart that is incapable of being baffled, hurled by my hand,<br>destroyeth enemies by hundreds, and cometh back to my hand after<br>achieving its purpose. In thy hand, however, this dart, O son of Suta,<br>will slay only one powerful enemy of thine. And having achieved that<br>feat, it will, roaring and blazing, return to me!' Thereat Karna said, 'I<br>desire to slay in fierce fight even one enemy of mine, who roareth<br>fiercely and is hot as fire, and of whom I am in fear!' At this, Indra<br>said, 'Thou shall slay such a roaring and powerful foe in battle. But<br>that one whom thou seekest to slay, is protected by an illustrious<br>personage. Even He whom persons versed in the Vedas call 'the invincible<br>Boar,' and 'the incomprehensible Narayana,' even that Krishna himself, is<br>protecting him!' Thereupon Karna replied, 'Even if this be so, do thou, O<br>illustrious one give me the weapon that will destroy only one powerful<br>foe! I shall, on my part, bestow on thee my mail and ear-rings, cutting<br>them off my person. Do thou, however, grant that my body, thus wounded,<br>may not be unsightly!' Hearing this, Indra said, 'As thou, O Karna, art<br>bent upon observing the truth, thy person shall not be unsightly, or<br>shall any scar remain on it. And, O thou best of those that are graced<br>with speech, O Karna, thou shall be possessed of complexion and energy of<br>thy father him self. And if, maddened by wrath, thou hurlest this dart,<br>while there are still other weapons with thee, and when thy life also is<br>not in imminent peril, it will fall even on thyself.' Karna answered, 'As<br>thou directest me, O Sakra, I shall hurl this Vasavi dart only when I am<br>in imminent peril! Truly I tell thee this!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thereupon, O king, taking the blazing dart,<br>Karna began to peel off his natural mail. And beholding Karna cutting his<br>own body, the entire host of celestials and men and Danavas set up a<br>leonine roar. And Karna betrayed no contortions of face while peeling his<br>mail. And beholding that hero among men thus cutting his body with an<br>weapon, smiling ever and anon, celestial kettle-drums began to be played<br>upon and celestial flowers began to be showered on him. And Karna cutting<br>off the excellent mail from his person, gave it to Vasava, still<br>dripping. And cutting off his ear-rings also from off his ears, he made<br>them over to Indra. And it is for this fact that he came to be called<br>Karna. And Sakra, having thus beguiled Karna that made him famous in the<br>world, thought with a smile that the business of the sons of Pandu had<br>already been completed. And having done all this, he ascended to heaven.<br>And hearing that Karna had been beguiled, all the sons of Dhritarashtra<br>became distressed and shorn of pride. And the sons of Pritha, on the<br>other hand, learning that such plight had befallen the son of the<br>charioteer, were filled with joy."<br><br>Janamejaya said, "When were those heroes, the sons of Pandu, at that<br>time? And from whom did they hear this welcome news? And what also did<br>they do, when the twelfth year of their exile passed away? Do thou, O<br>illustrious one, tell me all this!"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Having defeated the chief of the Saindhavas, and<br>rescued Krishna, and having outlived the entire term of their painful<br>exile in the woods, and having listened to the ancient stories about gods<br>and Rishis recited by Markandeya, those heroes among men returned from<br>their asylum in Kamyaka to the sacred Dwaitavana, with all their cars,<br>and followers, and accompanied by their charioteers, their kine, and the<br>citizens who had followed them."
