                            Vaisampayana said, "After that great warrior Karna had been routed by the<br>Gandharvas, the whole of the Kuru army, O monarch, fled from the field in<br>the very sight of Dhritarashtra's son. And beholding all his troops<br>flying from the field of battle with their back to the foe, king<br>Duryodhana refused to fly. Seeing the mighty host of the Gandharvas<br>rushing towards him, that represser of foes poured down upon them a thick<br>shower of arrows. The Gandharvas, however, without regarding that arrowy<br>shower, and desirous also of slaying him, surrounded that car of his. And<br>by means of their arrows, they cut off into fragments the yoke, the<br>shaft, the fenders, the flagstaff, the three-fold bamboo poles, and the<br>principal turret of his car. And they also slew his charioteer and<br>horses, hacking them to pieces. And when Duryodhana, deprived of his car,<br>fell on the ground, the strong-armed Chitrasena rushed towards him and<br>seized him in such a way that it seemed his life itself was taken. And<br>after the Kuru king had been seized, the Gandharvas, surrounding<br>Dussasana, who was seated on his car, also took him prisoner. And some<br>Gandharvas seized Vivinsati and Chitrasena, and some Vinda and Anuvinda,<br>while others seized all the ladies of royal household. And the warriors<br>of Duryodhana, who were routed by the Gandharvas, joining those who had<br>fled first, approached the Pandavas (who were living in the vicinity).<br>And after Duryodhana had been made captive, the vehicles, the shops, the<br>pavilions, the carriages, and the draught animals, all were made over to<br>the Pandavas for protection. And those soldiers said, 'The mighty-armed<br>son of Dhritarashtra, possessed of great strength and handsome mien, is<br>being taken away captive by the Gandharvas! Ye sons of Pritha, follow<br>them! Dussasana, Durvishasa, Durmukha, and Durjaya, are all being led<br>away as captives in chains by the Gandharvas, as also all the ladies of<br>the royal household!'<br><br>"Crying thus, the followers of Duryodhana, afflicted with grief and<br>melancholy, approached Yudhishthira, desirous of effecting the release of<br>the king. Bhima then answered those old attendants of Duryodhana, who,<br>afflicted with grief and melancholy, were thus soliciting (the aid of<br>Yudhishthira), saying, 'What we should have done with great efforts,<br>arraying ourselves in line of battle, supported by horses and elephants<br>hath, indeed, been done by the Gandharvas! They that come hither for<br>other purposes, have been overtaken by consequences they had not<br>foreseen! Indeed, this is the result of the evil counsels of a king who<br>is fond of deceitful play! It hath been heard by us that the foe of a<br>person who is powerless, is overthrown by others. The Gandharvas have, in<br>an extraordinary way illustrated before our eyes the truth of this<br>saying! It seems that there is still fortunately some person in the world<br>who is desirous of doing us good who hath, indeed, taken upon his own<br>shoulders our pleasant load, although we are sitting idly! The wretch had<br>come hither to cast his eyes on us,&#8212;himself in prosperity while<br>ourselves are sunk in adversity and emaciated by ascetic austerities and<br>are exposed to wind, cold and heat. They that imitate the behaviour of<br>that sinful and wretched Kaurava, are now beholding his disgrace! He that<br>had instructed Duryodhana to do this, had certainly acted sinfully. That<br>the sons of Kunti are not wicked and sinful, I tell it before you all!"<br><br>"And while Bhima, the son of Kunti, was speaking thus in a voice of<br>sarcasm, king Yudhishthira told him, 'This is not time for cruel words!'"
