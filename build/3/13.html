                            "Vasudeva said, O lord of earth, if I had been present at Dwaraka, then,<br>O king, this evil would not have befallen thee! And, O irrepressible one,<br>coming unto the gambling-match, even if uninvited by the son of Amvika<br>(Dhritarashtra), or Duryodhana, or by the other Kauravas, I would have<br>prevented the game from taking place, by showing its many evils,<br>summoning to my aid Bhishma and Drona and Kripa, and Vahlika! O exalted<br>one, for thy sake I would have told the son of Vichitravirya&#8212;O foremost<br>of monarchs, let thy sons have nothing to do with dice!&#8212;I would have<br>shown the many evils (of dice) through which thou hast fallen into such<br>distress and the son of Virasena was formerly deprived of his kingdom! O<br>king, unthought of evils, befall a man from dice! I would have described<br>how a man once engaged in the game continueth to play (from desire of<br>victory). Women, dice, hunting and drinking to which people become<br>addicted in consequence of temptation, have been regarded as the four<br>evils that deprive a man of prosperity. And those versed in the Sastras<br>are of opinion that evils attend upon all these. They also that are<br>addicted to dice know all its evils. O thou of mighty arms, appearing<br>before the son of Amvika, I would have pointed out that through dice men<br>in a day lose their possessions, and fall into distress, and are deprived<br>of their untasted wealth, and exchange harsh words! O perpetuator of the<br>Kuru race, I would have pointed out these and other attendant evils! If<br>he had accepted my words thus addressed, the welfare of the Kurus as also<br>virtue itself would both have been secured! And, O foremost of kings, if<br>he had rejected my gentle counsels offered as medicine, then, O best of<br>the Bharata race, I would have compelled him by force! And, if those who<br>wait at his court, professing to be his friends but in reality his foes,<br>had supported him, then I would have slain them all, along with those<br>gamblers, there present! O Kauravya, it is owing to my absence from the<br>Anartta country at that time that thou hast fallen into such distress<br>begot of dice! O thou best of Kurus, O son of Pandu, on arriving at<br>Dwarka I learnt from Yuyudhana all about thy calamity! And, O foremost of<br>kings, directly I heard it with a heart sore agitated by grief, have I<br>speedily come here wishing to see thee, O king! Alas! O bull of the<br>Bharata race, ye have all fallen into dire distress! I see thee with thy<br>brothers plunged in misfortune!"
