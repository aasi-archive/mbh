                            "Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"After the Pandavas had gone to the forest,<br>Dhritarashtra the son of Amvika, whose knowledge was his eye,[14] became<br>exceedingly sorrowful. And seated at his ease the king addressed these<br>words to the virtuous Vidura of profound intelligence, 'Thy understanding<br>is as clear as that of Bhargava.[15] Thou knowest also all the subtleties<br>or morality, and thou lookest on all the Kauravas with an equal eye. O,<br>tell me what is proper for me and them. O Vidura, things having thus<br>taken their course, what should we do now? How may I secure the goodwill<br>of the citizens so that they may not destroy us to the roots? O, tell us<br>all, since thou art conversant with every excellent expedient.'<br><br>"Vidura said, 'The three-fold purposes, O king (viz., profit, pleasure,<br>and salvation), have their foundations in virtue, and the sages say that<br>a kingdom also standeth on virtue as its basis. Therefore, O monarch,<br>according to the best of thy power, cherish thou virtuously thy own sons<br>and those of Pandu. That virtue had been beguiled by wicked souls with<br>Suvala's son at their head, when thy sons invited the righteous<br>Yudhishthira and defeated him in the match at dice. O king, of this deed<br>of utter iniquity I behold this expiation whereby, O chief of the Kurus,<br>thy son, freed from sin, may win back his position among good men. Let<br>the sons of Pandu, obtain that which was given unto them by thee. For,<br>verily, even this is the highest morality that a king should remain<br>content with his own, and never covet another's possessions. Thy good<br>name then would not suffer nor would family dissensions ensue, nor<br>unrighteousness be thine. This then is thy prime duty now,&#8212;to gratify<br>the Pandavas and disgrace Sakuni. If thou wishest to restore to thy sons<br>the good fortune they have lost, then, O king, do thou speedily adopt<br>this line of conduct. If thou dost not act so, the Kurus will surely meet<br>with destruction, for neither Bhimasena nor Arjuna, if angry, will leave<br>any of their foes unslain. What is there in the world which is<br>unattainable to those who cannot among their warriors Savyasachin skilled<br>in arms; who have the Gandiva, the most powerful of all weapons in the<br>world, for their bow; and who have amongst them the mighty Bhima also as<br>a warrior? Formerly, as soon as thy son was born, I told thee,&#8212;Forsake<br>thou this inauspicious child of thine. Herein lieth the good of thy<br>race.&#8212;But thou didst not then act accordingly. Nor also, O king, have I<br>pointed out to thee the way of thy welfare. If thou doest as I have<br>counselled, thou shalt not have to repent afterwards. If thy son consent<br>to reign in peace jointly with the sons of Pandu, passing thy days in joy<br>thou shalt not have to repent. Should it be otherwise, abandon thou thy<br>child for thy own happiness. Putting Duryodhana aside, do thou install<br>the son of Pandu in the sovereignty, and let, O king, Ajatasatru, free<br>from passion, rule the earth virtuously. All the kings of the earth,<br>then, like Vaisyas, will, without delay, pay homage unto us. And, O king,<br>let Duryodhana and Sakuni and Karna with alacrity wait upon the Pandavas.<br>And let Dussasana, in open court, ask forgiveness of Bhimasena and of the<br>daughter of Drupada also. And do thou pacify Yudhishthira by placing him<br>on the throne with every mark of respect. Asked by thee, what else can I<br>counsel thee to do? By doing this, O monarch, thou wouldst do what was<br>proper.'<br><br>'Dhritarashtra said, 'These words, O Vidura, then thou hast spoken in<br>this assembly, with reference to the Pandavas and myself, are for their<br>good but not for ours. My mind doth not approve them. How hast thou<br>settled all this in thy mind now? When thou hast spoken all this on<br>behalf of the Pandavas, I perceive that thou art not friendly to me. How<br>can I abandon my son for the sake of the sons of Pandu? Doubtless they<br>are my sons, but Duryodhana is sprung from my body. Who then, speaking<br>with impartiality, will ever counsel me to renounce my own body for the<br>sake of others? O Vidura, all that thou sayest is crooked, although I<br>hold thee in high esteem. Stay or go as thou likest. However much may she<br>be humoured, an unchaste will forsaketh her husband.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, O king, saying this Dhritarashtra rose suddenly and<br>went into the inner apartments. And Vidura, saying 'This race is doomed'<br>went away to where the sons of Pritha were.'"
