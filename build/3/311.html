                            Vaisampayana said, "Yudhishthira saw his brothers, each possessed of the<br>glory of Indra himself, lying dead like the Regents of the world dropped<br>from their spheres at the end of the Yuga. And beholding Arjuna lying<br>dead, with his bow and arrows dropped on the ground, and also Bhimasena<br>and the twins motionless and deprived of life, the king breathed a hot<br>and long sigh, and was bathed in tears of grief. And beholding his<br>brothers lying dead, the mighty armed son of Dharma with heart racked in<br>anxiety, began to lament profusely, saying, 'Thou hadst, O mighty-armed<br>Vrikodara, vowed, saying,&#8212;I shall with mace smash the thighs of<br>Duryodhana in battle! O enhancer of the glory of the Kurus, in thy death,<br>O mighty-armed and high-souled one, all that hath become fruitless now!<br>The promises of men may be ineffectual; but why have the words of the<br>gods uttered in respect of thee been thus fruitless? O Dhananjaya, while<br>thou wert in thy mother's lying-in-room, the gods had said,&#8212;O Kunti,<br>this thy son shall not be inferior to him of a thousand eyes! And in the<br>northern Paripatra mountains, all beings had sung, saying,&#8212;The<br>prosperity (of this race), robbed by foes will be recovered by this one<br>without delay. No one will be able to vanquish him in battle, while there<br>will be none whom he will not be able to vanquish. Why then hath that<br>Jishnu endued with great strength been subject to death? Oh, why doth<br>that Dhananjaya, relying on whom we had hitherto endured all this misery,<br>lie on the ground blighting[108] all my hopes! Why have those heroes,<br>those mighty sons of Kunti, Bhimasena and Dhananjaya, came under the<br>power of the enemy,&#8212;those who themselves always slew their foes, and<br>whom no weapons could resist! Surely, this vile heart of mine must be<br>made of adamant, since, beholding these twins lying today on the ground<br>it doth not split! Ye bulls among men, versed in holy writ and acquainted<br>with the properties of time and place, and endued with ascetic merit, ye<br>who duly performed all sacred rites, why lie ye down, without performing<br>acts deserving of you? Alas, why lie ye insensible on the earth, with<br>your bodies unwounded, ye unvanquished ones, and with your vows<br>untouched?' And beholding his brothers sweetly sleeping there as (they<br>usually did) on mountain slopes, the high souled king, overwhelmed with<br>grief and bathed in sweat, came to a distressful condition. And<br>saying,&#8212;It is even so&#8212;that virtuous lord of men, immersed in an ocean<br>of grief anxiously proceeded to ascertain the cause (of that<br>catastrophe). And that mighty-armed and high-souled one, acquainted with<br>the divisions of time and place, could not settle his course of action.<br>Having thus bewailed much in this strain, the virtuous Yudhishthira, the<br>son of Dharma or Tapu, restrained his soul and began to reflect in his<br>mind as to who had slain those heroes. 'There are no strokes of weapons<br>upon these, nor is any one's foot-print here. The being must be mighty I<br>ween, by whom my brothers have been slain. Earnestly shall I ponder over<br>this, or, let me first drink of the water, and then know all. It may be<br>that the habitually crooked-minded Duryodhana hath caused this water to<br>be secretly placed here by the king of the Gandharvas. What man of sense<br>can trust wicked wight of evil passions with whom good and evil are<br>alike? Or, perhaps, this may be an act of that wicked-souled one through<br>secret messengers of his.' And it was thus that that highly intelligent<br>one gave way to diverse reflections. He did not believe that water to<br>have been tainted with poison, for though dead no corpse-like pallor was<br>on them. 'The colour on the faces of these my brothers hath not faded!'<br>And it was thus that Yudhishthira thought. And the king continued, 'Each<br>of these foremost of men was like unto a mighty cataract. Who, therefore,<br>save Yama himself who in due time bringeth about the end of all things,<br>could have baffled them thus.' And having concluded this for certain, he<br>began to perform his ablutions in that lake. And while he descended into<br>it, he heard these words from the sky, uttered by the Yaksha,&#8212;'I am a<br>crane, living on tiny fish. It is by me that thy younger brothers have<br>been brought under the sway of the lord of departed spirits. If, thou, O<br>prince, answer not the questions put by me, even thou shalt number the<br>fifth corpse. Do not, O child, act rashly! This lake hath already been in<br>my possession. Having answered my questions first, do thou, O Kunti's<br>son, drink and carry away (as much as thou requirest)!' Hearing these<br>words, Yudhishthira said, 'Art thou the foremost of the Rudras, or of the<br>Vasus, or of the Marutas? I ask, what god art thou? This could not have<br>been done by a bird! Who is it that hath overthrown the four mighty<br>mountains, viz., the Himavat, the Paripatra, the Vindhya, and the Malaya?<br>Great is the feat done by thee, thou foremost of strong persons! Those<br>whom neither gods, nor Gandharvas nor Asuras, nor Rakshasas could endure<br>in mighty conflict, have been slain by thee! Therefore, exceedingly<br>wonderful is the deed done by thee! I do not know what thy business may<br>be, nor do I know thy purpose. Therefore, great is the curiosity and fear<br>also that have taken possession of me? My mind is greatly agitated, and<br>as my head also is aching, I ask thee, therefore, O worshipful one, who<br>art thou that stayest here?' Hearing these words the Yaksha said, 'I am,<br>good betide thee, a Yaksha, and not an amphibious bird. It is by me that<br>all these brothers of thine, endued with mighty prowess, have been slain!'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these accursed words couched in harsh<br>syllabus,[109] Yudhishthira, O king, approaching the Yaksha who had<br>spoken then, stood there. And that bull among the Bharatas then beheld<br>that Yaksha of unusual eyes and huge body tall like a palmyra-palm and<br>looking like fire or the Sun, and irresistible and gigantic like a<br>mountain, staying on a tree, and uttering a loud roar deep as that of the<br>clouds. And the Yaksha said, 'These thy brothers, O king, repeatedly<br>forbidden by me, would forcibly take away water. It is for this that they<br>have been slain by me! He that wisheth to live, should not, O king, drink<br>this water! O son of Pritha, act not rashly! This lake hath already been<br>in my possession. Do thou, O son of Kunti, first answer my questions, and<br>then take away as much as thou likest!' Yudhishthira said, 'I do not, O<br>Yaksha, covet, what is already in thy possession! O bull among male<br>beings, virtuous persons never approve that one should applaud his own<br>self (without boasting, I shall, therefore, answer thy questions,<br>according to my intelligence). Do thou ask me!' The Yaksha then said,<br>'What is it that maketh the Sun rise? Who keeps him company? Who causeth<br>him to set? And in whom is he established?' Yudhishthira answered,<br>'Brahma maketh the Sun rise: the gods keep him company: Dharma causeth<br>him to set: and he is established in truth.'[110] The Yaksha asked, 'By<br>what doth one become learned? By what doth he attain what is very great?<br>How can one have a second? And, O king, how can one acquire<br>intelligence?' Yudhishthira answered, 'It is by the (study of the) Srutis<br>that a person becometh learned; it is by ascetic austerities that one<br>acquireth what is very great: it is by intelligence that a person<br>acquireth a second and it is by serving the old that one becometh<br>wise.'[111] The Yaksha asked, 'What constituteth the divinity of the<br>Brahmanas? What even is their practice that is like that of the pious?<br>What also is the human attribute of the Brahmanas? And what practice of<br>theirs is like that of the impious?' Yudhishthira answered, 'The study of<br>the Vedas constitutes their divinity: their asceticism constitutes<br>behaviour that is like that of the pious; their liability to death is<br>their human attribute and slander is their impiety.' The Yaksha asked,<br>'What institutes the divinity of the Kshatriyas? What even is their<br>practice that is like that of the pious? What is their human attribute?<br>And what practice of theirs is like that of the impious?' Yudhishthira<br>answered, 'Arrows and weapons are their divinity: celebration of<br>sacrifices is that act which is like that of the pious: liability to fear<br>is their human attribute; and refusal of protection is that act of theirs<br>which is like that of the impious.' The Yaksha asked, 'What is that which<br>constitutes the Sama of the sacrifice? What the Yajus of the sacrifice?<br>What is that which is the refuge of a sacrifice? And what is that which<br>sacrifice cannot do without?' Yudhishthira answered, 'Life is the Sama of<br>the sacrifice; the mind is the Yajus of the sacrifice: the Rik is that<br>which is the refuge of the sacrifice; and it is Rik alone which sacrifice<br>cannot do without.'[112] The Yaksha asked, 'What is of the foremost value<br>to those that cultivate? What is of the foremost value to those that sow?<br>What is of the foremost value to those that wish for prosperity in this<br>world? And what is of the foremost value to those that bring forth?'<br>Yudhishthira answered, 'That which is of the foremost value to those that<br>cultivate is rain: that of the foremost value to those that sow is seed:<br>that of the foremost value to those that bring forth is offspring.[113]'<br>The Yaksha asked, 'What person, enjoying all the objects of the senses,<br>endued with intelligence, regarded by the world and liked by all beings,<br>though breathing, doth not offer anything to these five, viz., gods,<br>guests, servants, Pitris, and himself, though endued with breath, is not<br>yet alive.' The Yaksha asked, 'What is weightier than the earth itself?<br>What is higher than the heavens?' What is fleeter than the wind? And what<br>is more numerous than grass?' Yudhishthira answered, 'The mother is<br>weightier than the earth; the father is higher than the heaven; the mind<br>is fleeter than the wind; and our thoughts are more numerous than grass.'<br>The Yaksha asked, 'What is that which doth not close its eyes while<br>asleep; What is that which doth not move after birth? What is that which<br>is without heart? And what is that which swells with its own impetus?'<br>Yudhishthira answered, 'A fish doth not close its eyes while asleep: an<br>egg doth not move after birth: a stone is without heart: and a river<br>swelleth with its own impetus.' The Yaksha asked, 'Who is the friend of<br>the exile? Who is the friend of the householder? Who is the friend of him<br>that ails? And who is the friend of one about to die?' Yudhishthira<br>answered, 'The friend of the exile in a distant land is his companion,<br>the friend of the householder is the wife; the friend of him that ails is<br>the physician: and the friend of him about to die is charity. The Yaksha<br>asked,&#8212;'Who is the guest of all creatures? What is the eternal duty?<br>What, O foremost of kings, is Amrita? And what is this entire Universe?'<br>Yudhishthira answered,&#8212;Agni is the guest of all creatures: the milk of<br>kine is amrita: Homa (therewith) is the eternal duty: and this Universe<br>consists of air alone.'[114] The Yaksha asked,&#8212;'What is that which<br>sojourneth alone? What is that which is re-born after its birth? What is<br>the remedy against cold? And what is the largest field?' Yudhishthira<br>answered,&#8212;'The sun sojourneth alone; the moon takes birth anew: fire is<br>the remedy against cold: and the Earth is the largest field.' The Yaksha<br>asked,&#8212;'What is the highest refuge of virtue? What of fame? What of<br>heaven? And what, of happiness?' Yudhishthira answered,&#8212;'Liberality is<br>the highest refuge of virtue: gift, of fame: truth, of heaven: and good<br>behaviour, of happiness.' The Yaksha asked,&#8212;'What is the soul of man?<br>Who is that friend bestowed on man by the gods? What is man's chief<br>support? And what also is his chief refuge?' Yudhishthira answered,&#8212;'The<br>son is a man's soul: the wife is the friend bestowed on man by the gods;<br>the clouds are his chief support; and gift is his chief refuge.' The<br>Yaksha asked,&#8212;'What is the best of all laudable things? What is the most<br>valuable of all his possessions? What is the best of all gains? And what<br>is the best of all kinds of happiness?' Yudhishthira answered,&#8212;"The best<br>of all laudable things is skill; the best of all possessions is<br>knowledge: the best of all gains is health: and contentment is the best<br>of all kinds of happiness.' The Yaksha asked,&#8212;'What is the highest duty<br>in the world? What is that virtue which always beareth fruit? What is<br>that which if controlled, leadeth not to regret? And who are they with<br>whom an alliance cannot break?' Yudhishthira answered,&#8212;'The highest of<br>duties is to refrain from injury: the rites ordained in the Three (Vedas)<br>always bear fruit: the mind, if controlled, leadeth to no regret: and an<br>alliance with the good never breaketh.' The Yaksha asked,&#8212;'What is that<br>which, if renounced, maketh one agreeable? What is that which, if<br>renounced, leadeth to no regret? What is that which, if renounced, maketh<br>one wealthy? And what is that which if renounced, maketh one happy?'<br>Yudhishthira answered,&#8212;'Pride, if renounced, maketh one agreeable;<br>wrath, if renounced leadeth to no regret: desire, if renounced, maketh<br>one wealthy: and avarice, if renounced, maketh one happy.' The Yaksha<br>asked,&#8212;'For what doth one give away to Brahmanas? For what to mimes and<br>dancers? For what to servants? And for what to king?' Yudhishthira<br>answered,&#8212;'It is for religious merit that one giveth away to Brahmanas:<br>it is for fame that one giveth away to mimes and dancers: it is for<br>supporting them that one giveth away to servants: and it is for obtaining<br>relief from fear that one giveth to kings.' The Yaksha asked,&#8212;'With what<br>is the world enveloped? What is that owing to which a thing cannot<br>discover itself? For what are friends forsaken? And for what doth one<br>fail to go to heaven?' Yudhishthira answered,&#8212;'The world is enveloped<br>with darkness. Darkness doth not permit a thing to show itself. It is<br>from avarice that friends are forsaken. And it is connection with the<br>world for which one faileth to go to heaven.' The Yaksha asked,&#8212;'For<br>what may one be considered as dead? For what may a kingdom be considered<br>as dead? For what may a Sraddha be considered as dead? And for what, a<br>sacrifice?' Yudhishthira answered,&#8212;'For want of wealth may a man be<br>regarded as dead. A kingdom for want of a king may be regarded as dead. A<br>Sraddha that is performed with the aid of a priest that hath no learning<br>may be regarded as dead. And a sacrifice in which there are no gifts to<br>Brahmanas is dead.' The Yaksha asked,&#8212;'What constitutes the way? What,<br>hath been spoken of as water? What, as food? And what, as poison? Tell us<br>also what is the proper time of a Sraddha, and then drink and take away<br>as much as thou likest!' Yudhishthira answered,&#8212;'They that are good<br>constitute the way.[115] Space hath been spoken of as water.[116] The cow<br>is food.[117] A request is poison. And a Brahmana is regarded as the<br>proper time of a Sraddha.[118] I do not know what thou mayst think of all<br>this, O Yaksha?' The Yaksha asked,&#8212;'What hath been said to be the sign<br>of asceticism? And what is true restraint? What constitutes forgiveness.<br>And what is shame?' Yudhishthira answered,&#8212;'Staying in one's own<br>religion is asceticism: the restraint of the mind is of all restraints<br>the true one: forgiveness consists in enduring enmity; and shame, in<br>withdrawing from all unworthy acts.' The Yaksha asked,&#8212;'What, O king is<br>said to be knowledge? What, tranquillity? What constitutes mercy? And<br>what hath been called simplicity?' Yudhishthira answered,&#8212;'True<br>knowledge is that of Divinity. True tranquillity is that of the heart.<br>Mercy consists in wishing happiness to all. And simplicity is equanimity<br>of heart.' The Yaksha asked,&#8212;'What enemy is invincible? What constitutes<br>an incurable disease for man? What sort of a man is called honest and<br>what dishonest?' Yudhishthira answered,&#8212;'Anger is an invincible enemy.<br>Covetousness constitutes an incurable disease. He is honest that desires<br>the weal of all creatures, and he is dishonest who is unmerciful.' The<br>Yaksha asked,&#8212;'What, O king, is ignorance? And what is pride? What also<br>is to be understood by idleness? And what hath been spoken of as grief?'<br>Yudhishthira answered,&#8212;'True ignorance consists in not knowing one's<br>duties. Pride is a consciousness of one's being himself an actor or<br>sufferer in life. Idleness consists in not discharging one's duties, and<br>ignorance in grief.' The Yaksha asked,&#8212;'What hath steadiness been said<br>by the Rishis to be? And what, patience? What also is a real ablution?<br>And what is charity?' Yudhishthira answered,&#8212;'Steadiness consists in<br>one's staying in one's own religion, and true patience consists in the<br>subjugation of the senses. A true bath consists in washing the mind clean<br>of all impurities, and charity consists in protecting all creatures.' The<br>Yaksha asked,&#8212;'What man should be regarded as learned, and who should be<br>called an atheist? Who also is to be called ignorant? What is called<br>desire and what are the sources of desire? And what is envy?'<br>Yudhishthira answered,&#8212;'He is to be called learned who knoweth his<br>duties. An atheist is he who is ignorant and so also he is ignorant who<br>is an atheist. Desire is due to objects of possession, and envy is<br>nothing else than grief of heart.' The Yaksha asked,&#8212;'What is pride, and<br>what is hypocrisy? What is the grace of the gods, and what is<br>wickedness?' Yudhishthira answered,&#8212;'Stolid ignorance is pride. The<br>setting up of a religious standard is hypocrisy. The grace of the gods is<br>the fruit of our gifts, and wickedness consists in speaking ill of<br>others.' The Yaksha asked,&#8212;'Virtue, profit, and desire are opposed to<br>one another. How could things thus antagonistic to one another exist<br>together?' Yudhishthira answered,&#8212;'When a wife and virtue agree with<br>each other, then all the three thou hast mentioned may exist together.'<br>The Yaksha asked,&#8212;'O bull of the Bharata race, who is he that is<br>condemned to everlasting hell? It behoveth thee to soon answer the<br>question that I ask!' Yudhishthira answered,&#8212;'He that summoneth a poor<br>Brahmana promising to make him a gift and then tells him that he hath<br>nothing to give, goeth to everlasting hell. He also must go to<br>everlasting hell, who imputes falsehood to the Vedas, the scriptures, the<br>Brahmanas, the gods, and the ceremonies in honour of the Pitris, He also<br>goeth to everlasting hell who though in possession of wealth, never<br>giveth away nor enjoyeth himself from avarice, saying, he hath none.' The<br>Yaksha asked,&#8212;'By what, O king, birth, behaviour, study, or learning<br>doth a person become a Brahmana? Tell us with certitude!' Yudhishthira<br>answered,-'Listen, O Yaksha! It is neither birth, nor study, nor<br>learning, that is the cause of Brahmanahood, without doubt, it is<br>behaviour that constitutes it. One's behaviour should always be<br>well-guarded, especially by a Brahmana. He who maintaineth his conduct<br>unimpaired, is never impaired himself. Professors and pupils, in fact,<br>all who study the scriptures, if addicted to wicked habits, are to be<br>regarded as illiterate wretches. He only is learned who performeth his<br>religious duties. He even that hath studied the four Vedas is to be<br>regarded as a wicked wretch scarcely distinguishable from a Sudra (if his<br>conduct be not correct). He only who performeth the Agnihotra and hath<br>his senses under control, is called a Brahmana!' The Yaksha asked,&#8212;'What<br>doth one gain that speaketh agreeable words? What doth he gain that<br>always acteth with judgment? What doth he gain that hath many friends?<br>And what he, that is devoted to virtue?'&#8212;Yudhishthira answered,&#8212;'He<br>that speaketh agreeable words becometh agreeable to all. He that acteth<br>with judgment obtaineth whatever he seeketh. He that hath many friends<br>liveth happily. And he that is devoted to virtue obtaineth a happy state<br>(in the next world).' The Yaksha asked,&#8212;'Who is truly happy? What is<br>most wonderful? What is the path? And what is the news? Answer these four<br>questions of mine and let thy dead brothers revive.' Yudhishthira<br>answered,&#8212;'O amphibious creature, a man who cooketh in his own house, on<br>the fifth or the sixth part of the day, with scanty vegetables, but who<br>is not in debt and who stirreth not from home, is truly happy. Day after<br>day countless creatures are going to the abode of Yama, yet those that<br>remain behind believe themselves to be immortal. What can be more<br>wonderful than this? Argument leads to no certain conclusion, the Srutis<br>are different from one another; there is not even one Rishi whose opinion<br>can be accepted by all; the truth about religion and duty is hid in<br>caves: therefore, that alone is the path along which the great have trod.<br>This world full of ignorance is like a pan. The sun is fire, the days and<br>nights are fuel. The months and the seasons constitute the wooden ladle.<br>Time is the cook that is cooking all creatures in that pan (with such<br>aids); this is the news.' The Yaksha asked,&#8212;'Thou hast, O represser of<br>foes, truly answered all my questions! Tell us now who is truly a man,<br>and what man truly possesseth every kind of wealth.' Yudhishthira<br>answered,&#8212;'The report of one's good action reacheth heaven and spreadeth<br>over the earth. As long as that report lasteth, so long is a person to<br>whom the agreeable and the disagreeable, weal and woe, the past and the<br>future, are the same, is said to possess every kind of wealth.' The<br>Yaksha said,&#8212;'Thou hast, O king truly answered who is a man, and what<br>man possesseth every kind of wealth. Therefore, let one only amongst thy<br>brothers, whom thou mayst wish, get up with life!' Yudhishthira<br>answered,&#8212;'Let this one that is of darkish hue, whose eyes are red, who<br>is tall like a large Sala tree, whose chest is broad and arms long, let<br>this Nakula, O Yaksha, get up with life! The Yaksha rejoined,-'This<br>Bhimasena is dear unto thee, and this Arjuna also is one upon whom all of<br>you depend! Why, then, O king dost thou, wish a step-brother to get up<br>with his life! How canst thou, forsaking Bhima whose strength is equal to<br>that of ten thousand elephants, wish Nakula to live? People said that<br>this Bhima was dear to thee. From what motive then dost thou wish a<br>step-brother to revive? Forsaking Arjuna the might of whose arm is<br>worshipped by all the sons of Pandu, why dost thou wish Nakula to<br>revive?' Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'If virtue is sacrificed, he that<br>sacrificeth it, is himself lost. So virtue also cherisheth the cherisher.<br>Therefore taking care that virtue by being sacrificed may not sacrifice<br>us, I never forsake virtue. Abstention from injury is the highest virtue,<br>and is, I ween, even higher than the highest object of attainment. I<br>endeavour to practise that virtue. Therefore, let Nakula, O Yaksha,<br>revive! Let men know that the king is always virtuous! I will never<br>depart from my duty. Let Nakula, therefore, revive! My father had two<br>wives, Kunti and Madri. Let both of them have children. This is what I<br>wish. As Kunti is to me, so also is Madri. There is no difference between<br>them in my eye. I desire to act equally towards my mothers. Therefore,<br>let Nakula live?' The Yaksha said,&#8212;'Since abstention from injury is<br>regarded by thee as higher than both profit and pleasure, therefore, let<br>all thy brothers live, O bull of Bharata race!"
