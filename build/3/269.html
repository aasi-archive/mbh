                            Vaisampayana said, "Meanwhile, the king of Sindhu was giving orders to<br>those princes, saying, 'Halt, strike, march, quick', and like. And on<br>seeing Bhima, Arjuna and the twin brothers with Yudhishthira, the<br>soldiers sent up a loud shout on the field of battle. And the warriors of<br>the Sivi, Sauvira and Sindhu tribes, at the sight of those powerful<br>heroes looking like fierce tigers, lost heart. And Bhimasena, armed with<br>a mace entirely of Saikya iron and embossed with gold, rushed towards the<br>Saindhava monarch doomed to death. But Kotikakhya, speedily surrounding<br>Vrikodara with an array of mighty charioteers, interposed between and<br>separated the combatants. And Bhima, though assailed with numberless<br>spears and clubs and iron arrows hurled at him by the strong arms of<br>hostile heroes, did not waver for one moment. On the other hand, he<br>killed, with his mace, an elephant with its driver and fourteen<br>foot-soldiers fighting in the front of Jayadratha's car. And Arjuna also,<br>desirous of capturing the Sauvira king, slew five hundred brave<br>mountaineers fighting in the van of the Sindhu army. And in that<br>encounter, the king himself slew in the twinkling of an eye, a hundred of<br>the best warriors of the Sauviras. And Nakula too, sword in hand, jumping<br>out of his chariot, scattered in a moment, like a tiller sowing seeds,<br>the heads of the combatants fighting in the rear. And Sahadeva from his<br>chariot began to fell with his iron shafts, many warriors fighting on<br>elephants, like birds dropped from the boughs of a tree. Then the king of<br>Trigartas, bow in hand descending from his great chariot, killed the four<br>steeds of the king with his mace. But Kunti's son, king Yudhishthira the<br>just, seeing the foe approach so near, and fighting on foot, pierced his<br>breast with a crescent-shaped arrow. And that hero, thus wounded in the<br>breast began to vomit blood, and fell down upon the ground besides<br>Pritha's son, like an uprooted tree. And king Yudhishthira the just,<br>whose steeds had been slain taking this opportunity, descended with<br>Indrasena from his chariot and mounted that of Sahadeva. And the two<br>warriors, Kshemankara and Mahamuksha, singling out Nakula, began to pour<br>on him from both sides a perfect shower of keen-edged arrows. The son of<br>Madri, however, succeeded in slaying, with a couple of long shafts, both<br>those warriors who had been pouring on him an arrowy shower&#8212;like clouds<br>in the rainy season. Suratha, the king of Trigartas, well-versed in<br>elephant-charges, approaching the front of Nakula's chariot, caused it to<br>be dragged by the elephant he rode. But Nakula, little daunted at this,<br>leaped out of his chariot, and securing a point of vantage, stood shield<br>and sword in hand, immovable as a hill. Thereupon Suratha, wishing to<br>slay Nakula at once, urged towards him his huge and infuriate elephant<br>with trunk upraised. But when the beast came near, Nakula with his sword<br>severed from his head both trunk and tusks. And that mail-clad elephant,<br>uttering a frightful roar, fell headlong upon the ground, crushing its<br>riders by the fall. And having achieved this daring feat, heroic son of<br>Madri, getting up on Bhimasena's car, obtained a little rest. And Bhima<br>too, seeing prince Kotikakhya rush to the encounter, cut off the head of<br>his charioteer with a horse-shoe arrow. That prince did not even perceive<br>that his driver was killed by his strong-armed adversary, and his horses,<br>no longer restrained by a driver, ran about on the battle-field in all<br>directions. And seeing that prince without a driver turn his back, that<br>foremost of smiters, Bhima the son of Pandu, went up to him and slew him<br>with a bearded dart. And Dhananjaya also cut off with his sharp<br>crescent-shaped arrows, the heads, as well as the bows of all the twelve<br>Sauvira heroes. And the great warrior killed in battle, with the arrow,<br>the leaders of the Ikshwakus and the hosts of Sivis and Trigartas and<br>Saindhavas. And a great many elephants with their colours, and chariots<br>with standards, were seen to fall by the hand of Arjuna. And heads<br>without trunks, and trunks without heads, lay covering the entire field<br>of battle. And dogs, and herons and ravens, and crows, and falcons, and<br>jackals, and vultures, feasted on the flesh and blood of warriors slain<br>on that field. And when Jayadratha, the king of Sindhu, saw that his<br>warriors were slain, he became terrified and anxious to run away leaving<br>Krishna behind. And in that general confusion, the wretch, setting down<br>Draupadi there, fled for his life, pursuing the same forest path by which<br>he had come. And king Yudhishthira the just, seeing Draupadi with Dhaumya<br>walking before, caused her to be taken up on a chariot by the heroic<br>Sahadeva, the son of Madri. And when Jayadratha had fled away Bhima began<br>to mow down with his iron-arrows such of his followers as were running<br>away striking each trooper down after naming him. But Arjuna perceiving<br>that Jayadratha had run away exhorted his brother to refrain from<br>slaughtering the remnant of the Saindhava host. And Arjuna said, 'I do<br>not find on the field of battle Jayadratha through whose fault alone we<br>have experienced this bitter misfortune! Seek him out first and may<br>success crown thy effort! What is the good of thy slaughtering these<br>troopers? Why art thou bent upon this unprofitable business?'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Bhimasena, thus exhorted by Arjuna of great<br>wisdom, turning to Yudhishthira, replied, saying, 'As a great many of the<br>enemy's warriors have been slain and as they are flying in all<br>directions, do thou, O king, now return home, taking with thee Draupadi<br>and the twin brothers and high-souled Dhaumya, and console the princess<br>after getting back to our asylum! That foolish king of Sindhu I shall not<br>let alone as long as he lives, even if he find a shelter in the internal<br>regions or is backed by Indra himself! And Yudhishthira replied, saying,<br>'O thou of mighty arms remembering (our sister) Dussala and the<br>celebrated Gandhari, thou shouldst not slay the king of Sindhu even<br>though he is so wicked!'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Hearing these words, Draupadi was greatly<br>excited. And that highly intelligent lady in her excitement said to her<br>two husbands, Bhima and Arjuna with indignation mixed with modesty, 'If<br>you care to do what is agreeable to me, you must slay that mean and<br>despicable wretch, that sinful, foolish, infamous and contemptible chief<br>of the Saindhava clan! That foe who forcibly carries away a wife, and he<br>that wrests a kingdom, should never be forgiven on the battle-field, even<br>though he should supplicate for mercy!' Thus admonished, those two<br>valiant warriors went in search of the Saindhava chief. And the king<br>taking Krishna with him returned home, accompanied by his spiritual<br>adviser. And on entering the hermitage, he found it was laid over with<br>seats for the ascetics and crowded with their disciples and graced with<br>the presence of Markandeya and other Brahmanas. And while those Brahmanas<br>were gravely bewailing the lot of Draupadi, Yudhishthira endued with<br>great wisdom joined their company, with his brothers. And beholding the<br>king thus come back after having defeated the Saindhava and the Sauvira<br>host and recovered Draupadi, they were all elated with joy! And the king<br>took his seat in their midst. And the excellent princess Krishna entered<br>the hermitage with the two brothers.<br><br>"Meanwhile Bhima and Arjuna, learning the enemy was full two miles ahead<br>of them urged their horses to greater speed in pursuit of him. And the<br>mighty Arjuna performed a wonderful deed, killing the horse of Jayadratha<br>although they were full two miles ahead of them. Armed with celestial<br>weapons undaunted by difficulties he achieved this difficult feat with<br>arrows inspired with Mantras. And then the two warriors, Bhima and<br>Arjuna, rushed towards the terrified king of Sindhu whose horses had been<br>slain and who was alone and perplexed in mind. And the latter was greatly<br>grieved on seeing his steeds slain. And beholding Dhananjaya do such a<br>daring deed, and intent on running away, he followed the same forest<br>track by which he had come. And Falguna, seeing the Saindhava chief so<br>active in his fright, overtook him and addressed him saying, 'Possessed<br>of so little manliness, how couldst thou dare to take away a lady by<br>force? Turn round, O prince; it is not meet that thou shouldst run away!<br>How canst thou act so, leaving thy followers in the midst of thy foes?'<br>Although addressed by the sons of Pritha thus, the monarch of Sindhu did<br>not even once turn round. And then bidding him to what he chose the<br>mighty Bhima overtook him in an instant, but the kind Arjuna entreated<br>him not to kill that wretch."
