                            "Vrihadaswa said, 'Having made this compact with Dwapara, Kali came to<br>the place where the king of the Nishadhas was. And always watching for a<br>hole, he continued to dwell in the country of the Nishadhas for a long<br>time. And it was in the twelfth year that Kali saw a hole. For one day<br>after answering the call of nature, Naishadha touching water said his<br>twilight prayers, without having previously washed his feet. And it was<br>through this (omission) that Kali entered his person. And having<br>possessed Nala, he appeared before Pushkara, and addressed him, saying,<br>'Come and play at dice with Nala. Through my assistance thou wilt surely<br>win at the play. And defeating king Nala and acquiring his kingdom, do<br>thou rule the Nishadhas.' Thus exhorted by Kali, Pushkara went to Nala.<br>And Dwapara also approached Pushkara, becoming the principal die called<br>Vrisha. And appearing before the warlike Nala, that slayer of hostile<br>heroes, Pushkara, repeatedly said, 'Let us play together with dice.' Thus<br>challenged in the presence of Damayanti, the lofty-minded king could not<br>long decline it. And he accordingly fixed the time for the play. And<br>possessed by Kali, Nala began to lose, in the game, his stakes in gold,<br>and silver, and cars with the teams thereof, and robes. And maddened at<br>dice, no one amongst his friends could succeed in dissuading that<br>represser of foes from the play that went on. And thereupon, O Bharata,<br>the citizens in a body, with the chief councillors, came thither to<br>behold the distressed monarch and make him desist. And the charioteer<br>coming to Damayanti spake to her of this, saying, 'O lady, the citizens<br>and officers of the state wait at the gate. Do thou inform the king of<br>the Nishadhas that the citizens have come here, unable to bear the<br>calamity that hath befallen their king conversant with virtue and<br>wealth.' Thereupon Bhima's daughter, overwhelmed with grief and almost<br>deprived of reason by it, spake unto Nala in choked accents, 'O king, the<br>citizens with the councillors of state, urged by loyalty, stay at the<br>gate desirous of beholding thee. It behoveth thee to grant them an<br>interview.' But the king, possessed by Kali, uttered not a word in reply<br>unto his queen of graceful glances, uttering thus her lamentations. And<br>at this, those councillors of state as also the citizens, afflicted with<br>grief and shame, returned to their homes, saying, 'He liveth not.' And, O<br>Yudhishthira, it was thus that Nala and Pushkara gambled together for<br>many months, the virtuous Nala being always worsted.'"
