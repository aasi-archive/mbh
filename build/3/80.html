                            (Tirtha-yatra Parva)<br><br>Janamejaya said, "O holy one, after my great-grandfather Partha had gone<br>away from the woods of Kamyaka, what did the sons of Pandu do in the<br>absence of that hero capable of drawing the bow with his left hand? It<br>seemeth to me that mighty bowman and vanquisher of armies was their<br>refuge, as Vishnu of the celestials. How did my heroic grandsires pass<br>their time in the forest, deprived of the company of that hero, who<br>resembled Indra himself in prowess and never turned his back in battle?"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "After Arjuna of unbaffled prowess had gone away from<br>Kamyaka, the sons of Pandu, O son, were filled with sorrow and grief. And<br>the Pandavas with cheerless hearts very much resembled pearls unstrung<br>from a wreath, or birds shorn of their wings. And without that hero of<br>white steeds that forest looked like the Chaitraratha woods when deprived<br>of the presence of Kuvera. And, O Janamejaya, those tigers among men&#8212;the<br>sons of Pandu&#8212;deprived of the company of Arjuna, continued to live in<br>Kamyaka in perfect cheerlessness. And, O chief of the Bharata race, those<br>mighty warriors endowed with great prowess slew with pure arrows various<br>kinds of sacrificial animals for the Brahmanas. And those tigers among<br>men and repressors of foes, daily slaying those wild animals and<br>sanctifying them properly, offered them unto the Brahmanas. And it was<br>thus, O king, that those bulls among men afflicted with sorrow lived<br>there with cheerless hearts after Dhananjaya's departure. The princess of<br>Panchala in particular, remembering her third lord, addressed the anxious<br>Yudhishthira and said, 'That Arjuna who with two hands rivals the<br>thousand-armed Arjuna (of old), alas, without that foremost of the sons<br>of Pandu, this forest doth not seem at all beautiful in my eyes. Without<br>him, whenever I cast my eyes, this earth seems to be forlorn. Even this<br>forest with its blossoming trees and so full of wonders, without Arjuna<br>seems not so delightful as before. Without him who is like a mass of blue<br>clouds (in hue), who hath the prowess of an infuriated elephant, and<br>whose eyes are like the leaves of the lotus, this Kamyaka forest doth not<br>seem beautiful to me. Remembering that hero capable of drawing the bow<br>with his left hand, and the twang of whose bow sounds like the roar of<br>thunder, I cannot feel any happiness, O king!' And, O monarch, hearing<br>her lament in this strain, that slayer of hostile heroes, Bhimasena,<br>addressed Draupadi in these words, 'O blessed lady of slender waist, the<br>agreeable words thou utterest delight my heart like the quaffing of<br>nectar. Without him whose arms are long and symmetrical, and stout and<br>like unto a couple of iron maces and round and marked by the scars of the<br>bow-strings and graced with the bow and sword and other weapons and<br>encircled with golden bracelets and like unto a couple of five-headed<br>snakes, without that tiger among men the sky itself seemeth to be without<br>the sun. Without that mighty-armed one relying upon whom the Panchalas<br>and the Kauravas fear not the sternly-exerting ranks of the celestials<br>themselves, without that illustrious hero relying upon whose arms we all<br>regard our foes as already vanquished and the earth itself as already<br>conquered, without that Phalguna I cannot obtain any peace in the woods<br>of Kamyaka. The different directions also, wherever I cast my eyes,<br>appear to be empty!'<br><br>"After Bhima had concluded, Nakula the son of Pandu, with voice choked<br>with tears, said, 'Without him whose extraordinary deeds on the field of<br>battle constitute the talk of even the gods, without that foremost of<br>warriors, what pleasure can we have in the woods? Without him who having<br>gone towards the north had vanquished mighty Gandharva chiefs by<br>hundreds, and who having obtained numberless handsome horses of the<br>Tittiri and Kalmasha species all endowed with the speed of the wind,<br>presented them from affection unto his brother the king, on the occasion<br>of the great Rajasuya sacrifice, without that dear and illustrious one,<br>without that terrible warrior born after Bhima, without that hero equal<br>unto a god I do not desire to live in the Kamyaka woods any longer.'<br><br>"After Nakula's lamentations, Sahadeva said, 'He who having vanquished<br>mighty warriors in battle won wealth and virgins and brought them unto<br>the king on the occasion of the great Rajasuya sacrifice, that hero of<br>immeasurable splendour who having vanquished single-handed the assembled<br>Yadavas in battle, ravished Subhadra with the consent of Vasudeva, he,<br>who having invaded the dominion of the illustrious Drupada gave, O<br>Bharata, unto the preceptor Drona his tuition fee&#8212;beholding, O king,<br>that Jishnu's bed of grass empty in our asylum, my heart refuses<br>consolation. A migration from this forest is what, O represser of foes, I<br>would prefer for without that hero this forest cannot be delightful."
