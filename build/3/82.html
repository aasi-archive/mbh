                            "Pulastya said, 'O thou of excellent vows, I have been much gratified<br>with thy humility, thy self-control, and thy truth, thou blessed one<br>versed in morality! O sinless one, it is for this virtue of thine which<br>thou hast acquired from regard to thy ancestors, that I have been<br>gratified with thee and thou hast, O son, obtained a sight of my person.<br>O Bhishma. my eyes can penetrate into everything. Tell me what I may do<br>for thee. O sinless one, O thou foremost of the Kuru race, I will grant<br>thee whatever thou mayst ask me.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O highly blessed one, when thou who art worshipped by the<br>three worlds hast been gratified with me and when I have obtained a sight<br>of thy exalted self, I regard myself as already crowned with success.<br>But, O thou foremost of virtuous persons, if I have deserved thy favour,<br>I will tell thee my doubts and it behoveth thee to dispel them, O holy<br>one, I have some religious doubts in respect of tirthas. Speak of those<br>to me in detail, I desire to hear thee. O thou that resemblest a<br>celestial himself, what is his merit, O regenerate Rishi, who goeth round<br>the whole earth (visiting shrines). O tell me this with certainty."<br><br>"Pulastya said, 'O son, listen with attention. I will tell thee of the<br>merit which attacheth to tirthas and which constituth the refuge of the<br>Rishis. He whose hands and feet and mind and knowledge and asceticism and<br>acts are under wholesome control, enjoyeth the fruits of tirthas. He who<br>has ceased to accept gifts, he that is contented, he that is free from<br>pride enjoys the fruits of tirthas. He that is without sin, he that acts<br>without purpose, he that eats light, he that has his senses under<br>control, he that is free from every sin, enjoys the fruits of tirthas. O<br>king, he that is free from anger, he that adhereth to truth, he that is<br>firm in vows, he that regardeth all creatures as his own self, enjoyeth<br>the fruits of tirthas. In the Vedas the Rishis have declared in due order<br>the sacrifices and also their fruits here and hereafter truly. O lord of<br>earth, those sacrifices cannot be accomplished by him that is poor, for<br>those sacrifices require various materials and diverse things in large<br>measures. These, therefore can be performed by kings or sometimes by<br>other men of prosperity and wealth. O lord of men, that rite, however,<br>which men without wealth, without allies, singly, without wife and<br>children, and destitute of means, are capable of accomplishing and the<br>merit of which is equal unto the sacred fruits of sacrifices, I will now<br>declare unto thee, thou best of warriors! O thou best of the Bharata<br>race, sojourns in tirthas which are meritorious and which constitute one<br>of the high mysteries of the Rishis, are even superior to sacrifices. He<br>is a poor man who having gone to a tirtha hath not fasted for three<br>nights, who hath not given away gold, and who hath not distributed kine.<br>Indeed, one acquireth not, by the performance of the Agnishtoma and other<br>sacrifices distinguished by large gifts, that merit which one requireth<br>by a sojourn to a tirtha. In the world of men, there is that tirtha of<br>the God of gods, celebrated over the three worlds by the name of<br>Pushkara. One that sojourneth there becometh equal unto that deity. O<br>high-souled son of the Kuru race, during the two twilights and mid-day<br>there is the presence of hundred thousand millions of tirthas in<br>Pushkara. The Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the Sadhyas, the Maruts,<br>the Gandharvas, and the Apsaras are ever present, O exalted one, in<br>Pushkara. It was there, O king, that the gods, the Daityas and<br>Brahmarshis, having performed ascetic devotions there, obtained great<br>merit and finally attained to god-hood.'"<br><br>"Men of self-control, by even thinking mentally of Pushkara, are cleansed<br>from their sins, and regarded in heaven. O king, the illustrious<br>grand-sire having the lotus for his seat, had dwelt with great pleasure<br>in this tirtha. O blessed one, it was in Pushkara that the gods with the<br>Rishis having acquired of old great merit, finally obtained the highest<br>success. The person who, devoted to the worship of the gods and the<br>Pitris, batheth in this tirtha, obtaineth, it hath been said by the wise,<br>merit that is equal to ten times that of the horse-sacrifice. Having gone<br>to the Pushkara woods, he that feedeth even one Brahmana, becometh happy<br>here and hereafter, O Bhishma, for that act. He that supporteth himself<br>on vegetables and roots and fruits, may with pious regard and without<br>disrespect, give even such fare to a Brahmana. And, O best of kings, the<br>man of wisdom, even by such a gift, will acquire the merit of a<br>horse-sacrifice. Those illustrious persons among Brahmanas or Kshatriyas<br>or Vaisyas or Sudras that bathe in Pushkara are freed from the obligation<br>of rebirth. That man in special who visits Pushkara on the full moon of<br>the month of Karttika, acquireth ever-lasting regions in the abode of<br>Brahma. He that thinketh with joined hands morning and evening, of the<br>Pushkara, practically batheth, O Bharata, in every tirtha. Whether a male<br>or a female, whatever sins one may commit since birth, are all destroyed<br>as soon as one batheth in Pushkara. As the slayer of Madhu is the<br>foremost of all the celestials, so is Pushkara, O king, the foremost of<br>all tirthas. A man by residing with purity and regulated vows for twelve<br>years in Pushkara, acquireth the merit of all the sacrifices, and goeth<br>to the abode of Brahma. The merit of one who performeth the Agni-hotra<br>for full one hundred years, is equal to that of him who resideth for the<br>single month of Karttika in Pushkara. There are three white hillocks and<br>three springs known from the remotest times, we do not know why, by the<br>name of the Pushkara. It is difficult to go to Pushkara; it is difficult<br>to undergo ascetic austerities at Pushkara; it is difficult to give away<br>at Pushkara; and it is difficult to live at Pushkara."<br><br>"Having dwelt for twelve nights at Pushkara with regulated diet and vows,<br>and having walked round (the place), one must go to Jamvu-marga. One that<br>goeth to Jamvu-marga which is resorted to by the celestials, the Rishis,<br>and the Pitris, acquireth the merit of the horse-sacrifice and the<br>fruition of all his wishes. The man that resideth there for five nights,<br>hath his soul cleansed from all sins. He never sinketh into hell, but<br>acquireth high success. Leaving Jamvu-marga one must go to<br>Tandulikasrama. He that goeth there never sinketh into hell but ascendeth<br>to the abode of Brahma. He that goeth to the lake of Agastya and<br>occupieth himself with the worship of the Pitris and celestials, fasting<br>for three nights, acquireth, O king, the fruit of the Agnishtoma. Going<br>thither, he that liveth on vegetables or fruits acquireth the status<br>called Kaumara. One should next proceed to the beautiful asylum of Kanwa,<br>which is worshipped by the whole world. That sacred wood characterised by<br>holiness, existeth, O bull of the Bharata race, from very remote times.<br>As soon as one entereth it, he is freed from all his sins. He who with<br>regulated diet and vows worshippeth the Pitris and the gods there,<br>obtaineth the fruit of a sacrifice that is capable of bestowing the<br>fruition of all one's desires. Having walked round this asylum one must<br>then go to the spot where Yayati fell (from heaven). He that goeth<br>thither, acquireth the merit of a horse-sacrifice. One must then go to<br>Mahakala with regulated diet and senses subdued. And having bathed in the<br>tirtha called Koti, one obtaineth the merit of a horse-sacrifice. A<br>virtuous man should next proceed to the tirtha of Sthanu, the husband of<br>Uma, known over the three worlds by the name of Bhadravata. That best of<br>men who goeth to Bhadravata, beholdeth Isana and obtaineth the fruit of a<br>gift of a thousand kine. And through the grace of Mahadeva, he acquireth<br>the status of Ganapatya blessed with prosperity and peace and high grace.<br>Having arrived then at the Narmada, that river celebrated over the three<br>worlds, and given oblations of water to the Pitris and the gods, one<br>acquireth the fruit of the horse-sacrifice. He that goeth into the<br>Southern ocean, practising the Brahmacharya mode of life, and with senses<br>subdued, acquireth the fruit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice and ascendeth to<br>heaven. Having arrived at Charmanwati, with regulated diet and senses<br>subdued, one acquireth, at the command of Rantideva, the merit of the<br>Agnishtoma sacrifice. One must then go, O virtuous chief of warriors, to<br>Arvuda, the son of Himavat, where there was a hole through the earth in<br>days of yore. There is the asylum of Vasistha, celebrated over the three<br>worlds. Having resided for one night, one obtaineth the merit of the gift<br>of a thousand kine. He that, leading a Brahmacharya mode of life batheth<br>in the tirtha called Pinga, obtaineth, O tiger among kings, the merit of<br>the gift of a hundred Kapila kine. One must next go, O king, to that<br>excellent tirtha called Prabhasa. There Hutasana is always present in his<br>own person. He, the friend of Pavana, O hero, is the mouth of all the<br>gods. The man that with subdued and sanctified soul batheth in that<br>tirtha, obtaineth merit greater than that of the Agnishtoma or Atiratra<br>sacrifices. Proceeding next to the spot where the Saraswati mingleth with<br>the sea, one obtaineth the fruit of the gift of a thousand kine and<br>heaven also besides, O bull of the Bharata race, blazing forth for all<br>time like Agni himself. He that with subdued soul batheth in the tirtha<br>of the king of waters, and giveth oblations of water unto the Pitris and<br>the gods, living there for three nights, blazeth forth like the Moon, and<br>obtaineth also the fruit of the horse-sacrifice. One should next proceed,<br>O best of the Bharata, unto the tirtha known by the name of Varadana,<br>where (the Rishi) Durvasa had given a boon unto Vishnu. A man by bathing<br>in Varadana obtaineth the fruit of the gift of a thousand kine. One<br>should next proceed with subdued senses and regulated diet to Dwaravati,<br>where by bathing in Pindaraka, one obtaineth the fruit of the gift of<br>gold in abundance. O blessed one, it is wonderful to relate that in that<br>tirtha, to this day, coins with the mark of the lotus and lotuses also<br>with the mark of the trident, are seen. O represser of heroes! And O bull<br>among men, the presence of Mahadeva is there. Arriving then, O Bharata,<br>at the spot where the Sindhu mingleth with the sea, one should with<br>subdued soul bathe in that tirtha of Varuna. And bathing there and giving<br>oblations of water to the Pitris, the Rishis, and the gods one acquireth,<br>O bull of the Bharata race, the region of Varuna, and blazeth forth in<br>effulgence of his own. Men of wisdom say that, by worshipping the god<br>known by the name of Shankukarneswara, one acquireth ten times the merit<br>of the horse-sacrifice. O bull of the Bharata race, having walked round<br>that tirtha, one should, O thou foremost of the Kurus, go to that tirtha<br>celebrated over the three worlds and known by the name of Drimi. That<br>tirtha cleanseth from every sin, and it is there that the gods including<br>Brahma worship Maheswara. Having bathed there and worshipped Rudra<br>surrounded by the other gods, one is freed from all sins since birth. It<br>was there, O best of men, that Drimi was adored by all the gods. Bathing<br>there, O best of men, one obtaineth the fruit of the horse-sacrifice. O<br>thou of great intelligence, Vishnu the creator of the universe, after<br>slaying the Daityas and Danavas, went thither to purify himself. O<br>virtuous one, one should next proceed to Vasudhara adored by all. The<br>moment one arrives at that tirtha, one acquireth the fruit of the<br>horse-sacrifice. And, O thou best of the Kurus, by bathing there with<br>subdued soul and rapt attention, and giving oblations of water unto the<br>gods and the Pitris one ascendeth unto the region of Vishnu and is adored<br>there. In that tirtha, O bull of the Bharata race, there is a sacred lake<br>of the Vasus. By bathing there and drinking of its water, one becometh<br>regarded of the Vasus. There is a celebrated tirtha of the name of<br>Sindhuttama, which destroyeth every sin. O best of men, by bathing there,<br>one acquireth the fruit of the gift of gold in abundance. By arriving at<br>Bhadratunga with sanctified soul and purity of conduct, one acquireth the<br>region of Brahma and a high state of blessedness. There is then the<br>tirtha of the Kumarikas of Indra, that is much resorted to by the<br>Siddhas. O best of men, by bathing there, one obtaineth the region of<br>Indra. In Kumarika there is another tirtha called Renuka, which is also<br>resorted to by the Siddhas. A Brahmana by bathing there would become as<br>bright as the Moon. Proceeding next to the tirtha called the Panchananda,<br>with subdued sense and regulated diet, one obtaineth the fruit of the<br>five sacrifices that have been mentioned one after another in the<br>scriptures. Then, O king, one should go to the excellent region of Bhima.<br>O best of the Bharatas by bathing in the tirtha there, that is called<br>Yoni, a man (in his next birth) becometh, O king, the son of a goddess,<br>bearing ear-rings decked with pearls, and obtaineth also the merit of the<br>gift of a hundred thousand kine. Proceeding next to Srikunda, celebrated<br>over the three worlds and worshipping the grandsire, one obtaineth the<br>fruit of the gift of a thousand kine. O virtuous one, one should then go<br>to the excellent tirtha called Vimala, where to this day may be seen<br>fishes of golden and silver hues. By bathing there, one soon acquireth<br>the region of Vasava, and his soul being cleansed from every sin, he<br>attaineth to a high state of blessedness. Proceeding next to Vitasta and<br>giving oblations of water unto the Pitris and the gods, a man, O Bharata,<br>obtaineth the fruit of the Vajapeya sacrifice. That sin-destroying tirtha<br>known by the name of Vitasta, is situate in the country of the Kasmiras<br>and is the abode of the Naga Takshaka. Bathing there, a man certainly<br>obtaineth the fruit of the Vajapeya sacrifice, and his soul cleansed from<br>every sin, he attaineth to a high state of blessedness. One should next<br>proceed to Vadava celebrated over the three worlds. Bathing there with<br>due rites in the evening, one should offer rice boiled in butter and<br>milk, according to the best of his might, unto the deity of seven flames.<br>Men of wisdom say that a gift made here in honour of the Pitris, becometh<br>inexhaustible. The Rishis, the Pitris, the gods, the Gandharvas, several<br>tribes of Apsaras, the Guhyakas, the Kinnaras, the Yakshas, the Siddhas,<br>the Vidhyadharas, the Rakshasas, Daityas, Rudras, and Brahma himself, O<br>king, having with subdued senses, accepted a course of austerities for a<br>thousand years in order to move Vishnu to grace, cooked rice in milk and<br>butter and gratified Kesava with oblations, each offered with seven Riks.<br>And, O king, the gratified Kesava thereupon conferred on them the<br>eight-fold attributes called Aiswarya and other objects that they<br>desired. And having bestowed upon them these, that god disappeared in<br>their sight like lightning in the clouds. And it is for this, O Bharata,<br>that that tirtha became known by the name of Saptacharu, and if one<br>offereth Charu there to the seven flamed deity, he obtaineth merit<br>superior to that of the gift of a hundred thousand kine, to that of a<br>hundred Rajasuya sacrifices, as also of a hundred horse-sacrifices.<br>Leaving Vadava, O king, one should then proceed to Raudrapada, and<br>beholding Mahadeva there one obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice.<br>Proceeding then, with subdued soul and leading a Brahmacharya mode of<br>life, to Manimat, and residing there for one night, one acquireth, O<br>king, the merit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. One should then go, O king,<br>to Devika celebrated over the whole world. It was there, O bull of<br>Bharata race, that, as heard by us, the Brahmanas first sprang into<br>existence. There also is the region of the holder of the trident&#8212;a<br>region that is celebrated over the world. Having bathed in Devika and<br>worshipped Maheswara by offering him, to the best of one's might, rice<br>boiled in milk and butter, a man obtaineth, O bull of the Bharata race,<br>the merit of a sacrifice that is capable of filling every desire. There<br>also is another tirtha of Rudra called Kamakhya, which is much resorted<br>to by the gods. Bathing there, a man speedily obtaineth success. By<br>touching also the water of Yajana. Brahmavaluka, and Pushpamva, one<br>becometh free from sorrow in after life. The learned have said that the<br>sacred tirtha of Devika, the resort of the gods and the Rishis, is five<br>Yojanas in length and half a Yojana in breadth. One should then, in due<br>order, proceed, O king, to Dirghasatra. There the gods with Brahma at<br>their head, the Siddhas, and the greatest Rishis, with regulated vows and<br>the recitation and acceptance of the preliminary pledge, perform the<br>long-extending sacrifice. O king, by going only to Dirghasatra, O<br>represser of foes, one obtaineth merit that is superior, O Bharata, to<br>that of the Rajasuya or the horse-sacrifice. One should next proceed with<br>subdued senses and regulated diet to Vinasana, where Saraswati<br>disappearing on the breast of Meru, re-appeareth at Chamasa, Shivodbheda<br>and Nagadbheda. Bathing in Chamasadbheda, one obtaineth the merit of the<br>Agnishtoma sacrifice. Bathing in Shivodbheda, one acquireth the merit of<br>the gift of a thousand kine. And bathing in Nagodbheda, one obtaineth the<br>region of the Nagas. One should proceed, next, to the inaccessible tirtha<br>of Shasayana, where the cranes, O Bharata, disappearing in the form of<br>sasas, re-appear every year in the month of Karttika, and bathe, O<br>blessed chief of the Bharata race, in the Sarsawati. Bathing there, O<br>tiger among men, one blazeth forth like the Moon, and obtaineth, O bull<br>of the Bharata race, the merit of the gift of a thousand kine. One should<br>next proceed, O thou of the Kuru race, to Kumarakoti, with subdued<br>senses, and bathing there, worship the gods and the Puris. By doing this,<br>one obtaineth the merit of the gift of ten thousand kine, and raiseth all<br>his ancestors to higher regions. One should next, O virtuous one, proceed<br>with subdued soul to Rudrakoti, where in olden days, O king, ten millions<br>of Munis had assembled. And, O king, filled with great joy at the<br>prospect of beholding Mahadeva, the Rishis assembled there, each saying,<br>'I will first behold the god! I will first behold the god!' And, O king,<br>in order to prevent disputes amongst those Rishis of subdued souls, the<br>Lord of Yoga, by the help of his Yoga power, multiplied himself into ten<br>million forms, and stood before every one of them. And every one of these<br>Rishis said, 'I have seen him first!' And gratified, O king, with the<br>deep devotion of those Munis of subdued souls, Mahadeva granted them a<br>boon, saying, 'From this day your righteousness shall grow!' And, O tiger<br>among men, one that bathes, with a pure mind, in Rudrakoti obtaineth the<br>merit of the horse-sacrifice and delivereth his ancestors. One should<br>next proceed, O king, to that highly sacred and celebrated region where<br>the Saraswati mingles with the sea. Thither, O king, the gods with Brahma<br>at their head and Rishis with wealth of asceticism repair for adoring<br>Kesava on the fourteenth day of the lighted fortnight of the month of<br>Chaitra. Bathing there, O tiger among men, one obtaineth the merit of<br>giving away gold in abundance, and his soul being cleansed from every<br>sin, he ascendeth to the region of Brahma. It is there, O king, that the<br>Rishis have completed many a sacrifice. By a trip to that spot one<br>obtaineth the merit of the gifts of a thousand kine.'"
