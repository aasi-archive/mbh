                            "Markandeya said, 'Meanwhile the mighty Dyumatsena, having regained his<br>sight, could see everything. And when his vision grew clear he saw<br>everything around him. And, O bull of the Bharata race, proceeding with<br>his wife Saivya to all the (neighbouring) asylums in search of his son,<br>he became extremely distressed on his account. And that night the old<br>couple went about searching in asylums, and rivers, and woods, and<br>floods. And whenever they heard any sound, they stood rising their heads,<br>anxiously thinking that their son was coming, and said, 'O yonder cometh<br>Satyavan with Savitri!' And they rushed hither and thither like maniacs,<br>their feet torn, cracked, wounded, and bleeding, pierced with thorns and<br>Kusa blades. Then all the Brahmanas dwelling in that hermitage came unto<br>them, and surrounding them on all sides, comforted them, and brought them<br>back to their own asylum. And there Dyumatsena with his wife surrounded<br>by aged ascetics, was entertained with stories of monarchs of former<br>times. And although that old couple desirous of seeing their son, was<br>comforted, yet recollecting the youthful days of their son, they became<br>exceedingly sorry. And afflicted with grief, they began to lament in<br>piteous accents, saying, 'Alas, O son, alas, O chaste daughter-in-law,<br>where are you?' Then a truthful Brahmana of the name of Suvarchas spake<br>unto them, saying, 'Considering the austerities, self-restraint, and<br>behaviour of his wife Savitri, there can be no doubt that Satyavan<br>liveth!' And Gautama said, 'I have studied all the Vedas with their<br>branches, and I have acquired great ascetic merit. And I have led a<br>celibate existence, practising also the Brahmacharya mode of life. I have<br>gratified Agni and my superiors. With rapt soul I have also observed all<br>the vows: and I have according to the ordinance, frequently lived upon<br>air alone. By virtue of this ascetic merit, I am cognisant of all the<br>doings of others. Therefore, do thou take it for certain that Satyavan<br>liveth.' Thereupon his disciple said, 'The words that have fallen from<br>the lips of my preceptor can never be false. Therefore, Satyavan surely<br>liveth.' And the Rishi said, 'Considering the auspicious marks that his<br>wife Savitri beareth and all of which indicate immunity from widowhood,<br>there can be no doubt that Satyavan liveth!' And Varadwaja said, 'Having<br>regard to the ascetic merit, self-restraint, and conduct of his wife<br>Savitri, there can be no doubt that Satyavan liveth.' And Dalbhya said,<br>'Since thou hast regained thy sight, and since Savitri hath gone away<br>after completion of the vow, without taking any food, there can be no<br>doubt that Satyavan liveth.' And Apastamba said, 'From the manner in<br>which the voices of birds and wild animals are being heard through the<br>stillness of the atmosphere on all sides, and from the fact also of thy<br>having regained the use of thy eyes, indicating thy usefulness for<br>earthly purposes once more, there can be no doubt that Satyavan liveth.'<br>And Dhauma said, 'As thy son is graced with every virtue, and as he is<br>the beloved of all, and as he is possessed of marks betokening a long<br>life, there can be no doubt that Satyavan liveth.'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Thus cheered by those ascetics of truthful<br>speech, Dyumatsena pondering over those points, attained a little ease. A<br>little while after, Savitri with her husband Satyavan reached the<br>hermitage during the night and entered it with a glad heart. The<br>Brahmanas then said, 'Beholding this meeting with thy son, and thy<br>restoration to eye-sight, we all wish thee well, O lord of earth. Thy<br>meeting with thy son, the sight of thy daughter-in-law, and thy<br>restoration to sight&#8212;constitute a threefold prosperity which thou hast<br>gained. What we all have said must come to pass: there can be no doubt of<br>this. Henceforth thou shalt rapidly grow in prosperity.' Then, O Pritha's<br>son, the twice-born ones lighted a fire and sat themselves down before<br>king Dyumatsena. And Saivya, and Satyavan, and Savitri who stood apart,<br>their hearts free from grief, sat down with the permission of them all.<br>Then, O Partha, seated with the monarch those dwellers of the woods,<br>actuated by curiosity, asked the king's son, saying, 'Why didst thou not,<br>O illustrious one, come back earlier with thy wife? Why hast thou come so<br>late in the night? What obstacle prevented thee! We do not know, O son of<br>a king, why thou hast caused such alarm to us, and to thy father and<br>mother. It behoveth thee to tell us all about this,' Thereupon, Satyavan<br>said, 'With the permission of my father, I went to the woods with<br>Savitri. There, as I was hewing wood in the forest, I felt a pain in my<br>head. And in consequence of the pain, I fell into a deep sleep.&#8212;This is<br>all that I remember. I had never slept so long before I have come so late<br>at night, in order that ye might not grieve (on my account). There is no<br>other reason for this.' Gautama then said, 'Thou knowest not then the<br>cause of thy father's sudden restoration to sight. It, therefore,<br>behoveth Savitri to relate it. I wish to hear it (from thee), for surely<br>thou art conversant with the mysteries of good and evil. And, O Savitri,<br>I know thee to be like the goddess Savitri herself in splendour. Thou<br>must know the cause of this. Therefore, do thou relate it truly! If it<br>should not be kept a secret, do thou unfold it unto us!' At these words<br>of Gautama Savitri said, 'It is as ye surmise. Your desire shall surely<br>not be unfulfilled. I have no secret to keep. Listen to the truth then!<br>The high-souled Narada had predicted the death of my husband. To-day was<br>the appointed time. I could not, therefore, bear to be separated from my<br>husband's company. And after he had fallen asleep, Yama, accompanied by<br>his messengers, presented himself before him, and tying him, began to<br>take him away towards the region inhabited by the Pitris. Thereupon I<br>began to praise that august god, with truthful words. And he granted me<br>five boons, of which do ye hear from me! For my father-in-law I have<br>obtained these two boons, viz., his restoration to sight as also to his<br>kingdom. My father also hath obtained a hundred sons. And I myself have<br>obtained a hundred sons. And my husband Satyavan hath obtained a life of<br>four hundred years. It was for the sake of my husband's life that I had<br>observed that vow. Thus have I narrated unto you in detail the cause by<br>which this mighty misfortune of mine was afterwards turned into<br>happiness. The Rishis said, 'O chaste lady of excellent disposition,<br>observant of vows and endued with virtue, and sprung from an illustrious<br>line, by thee hath the race of this foremost of kings, which was<br>overwhelmed with calamities, and was sinking in an ocean of darkness,<br>been rescued.'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Then having applauded and reverenced that best of<br>women, those Rishis there assembled bade farewell to that foremost of<br>kings as well as to his son. And having saluted them thus, they speedily<br>went, in peace with cheerful hearts, to their respective abodes.'"
