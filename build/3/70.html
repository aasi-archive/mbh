                            "Vrihadaswa said, 'After a long time had passed away, a Brahmana named<br>Parnada returned to the city (of the Vidarbhas), and said unto the<br>daughter of Bhima, 'O Damayanti, seeking Nala, the king of Nishadhas, I<br>came to the city of Ayodhya, and appeared before the son of Bhangasura.<br>And, O best of women, I repeated those words of thine in the presence of<br>the blessed Rituparna. But hearing them neither that ruler of men, nor<br>his courtiers, answered anything, although I uttered them repeatedly.<br>Then, after I had been dismissed by the monarch, I was accosted by a<br>person in the service of Rituparna, named Vahuka. And Vahuka is the<br>charioteer of that king, of unsightly appearance and possessed of short<br>arms. And he is skillful in driving with speed, and well acquainted with<br>the culinary art. And sighing frequently, and weeping again and again, he<br>inquired about my welfare and afterwards said these words, 'Chaste women,<br>although fallen into distress, yet protect themselves and thus certainly<br>secure heaven. Although they may be deserted by their lords, they do not<br>yet become angry on that account, for women that are chaste lead their<br>lives, encased in the armour of virtuous behaviour. It behoveth her not<br>to be angry, since he that deserted her was overwhelmed with calamity,<br>and deprived of every bliss. A beauteous and virtuous woman should not be<br>angry with one that was deprived by birds of his garment while striving<br>to procure sustenance and who is being consumed with grief. Whether<br>treated well or ill, such a wife should never indulge in ire, beholding<br>her husband in that plight, despoiled of kingdom and destitute of<br>prosperity, oppressed with hunger and overwhelmed with calamity.' Hearing<br>these words of his, I have speedily come here. Thou hast now heard all.<br>Do what thou thinkest proper, and inform the king of it.'<br><br>"O king, having heard these words of Parnada, Damayanti with tearful eyes<br>came to her mother, and spake unto her in private, 'O mother, king Bhima<br>should not, by any means, be made acquainted with my purpose. In thy<br>presence will I employ that best of Brahmanas, Sudeva! If thou desirest<br>my welfare, act in such a way that king Bhima may not know my purpose.<br>Let Sudeva without delay go hence to the city of Ayodhya, for the purpose<br>of bringing Nala, O mother, having performed the same auspicious rites by<br>virtue of which he had speedily brought me into the midst of friends.'<br>With these words, after Parnada had recovered from fatigue, the princess<br>of Vidarbha worshipped him with profuse wealth and also said, 'When Nala<br>will come here, O Brahmana, I will bestow on thee wealth in abundance<br>again. Thou hast done me the immense service which none else, indeed, can<br>do me, for, (owing to that service of thine), O thou best of the<br>regenerate ones, I shall speedily regain my (lost) lord.' And thus<br>addressed by Damayanti, that high-minded Brahmana comforted her, uttering<br>benedictory words of auspicious import, and then went home, regarding his<br>mission to have been successful. And after he had gone away, Damayanti<br>oppressed with grief and distress, calling Sudeva, addressed him, O<br>Yudhishthira, in the presence of her mother, saying, 'O Sudeva, go thou<br>to the city of Ayodhya, straight as a bird, and tell king Rituparna<br>living there, these words: 'Bhima's daughter, Damayanti will hold another<br>Swayamvara. All the kings and princes are going thither. Calculating the<br>time, I find that the ceremony will take place tomorrow. O represser of<br>foes, if it is possible for thee, go thither without delay. Tomorrow,<br>after the sun hath risen, she will choose a second husband, as she doth<br>not know whether the heroic Nala liveth or not. And addressed by her, O<br>monarch thus, Sudeva set out. And he said unto Rituparna, all that he had<br>been directed to say.'"
