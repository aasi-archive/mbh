                            (Draupadi-harana Parva)<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "One day, having previously ascertained that the<br>Pandavas were all seated at their ease and that Krishna was reposing<br>herself after her meal, the sage Durvasa, surrounded by ten thousand<br>disciples repaired to that forest. The illustrious and upright king<br>Yudhishthira, seeing that guest arrived, advanced with his mothers to<br>receive him. And joining the palms of his hands and pointing to a proper<br>and excellent seat, he accorded the Rishis a fit and respectful welcome.<br>And the king said unto him, 'Return quick, O adorable sir, after<br>performing thy diurnal ablutions and observances.' And that sinless Muni,<br>not knowing how the king would be able to provide a feast for him and his<br>disciples, proceeded with the latter to perform his ablutions. And that<br>host of the Muni, of subdued passions, went into the stream for<br>performing their ablutions. Meanwhile, O king, the excellent princess<br>Draupadi, devoted to her husbands, was in great anxiety about the food<br>(to be provided for the Munis). And when after much anxious thought she<br>came to the conclusion that means there were none for providing a feast,<br>she inwardly prayed to Krishna, the slayer of Kansa. And the princess<br>said, 'Krishna, O Krishna, of mighty arms, O son of Devaki, whose power<br>is inexhaustible, O Vasudeva, O lord of the Universe, who dispellest the<br>difficulties of those that bow down to thee, thou art the soul, the<br>creator and the destroyer of the Universe. Thou, O lord, art<br>inexhaustible and the saviour of the afflicted. Thou art the preserver of<br>the Universe and of all created beings. Thou art the highest of the high,<br>and the spring of the mental perceptions Akuli and Chiti![88] O Supreme<br>and Infinite Being, O giver of all good, be thou the refuge of the<br>helpless. O Primordial Being, incapable of being conceived by the soul or<br>the mental faculties or otherwise, thou art the ruler of all and the lord<br>of Brahma. I seek thy protection. O god, thou art ever kindly disposed<br>towards those that take refuge in thee. Do thou cherish me with thy<br>kindness. O thou with a complexion dark as the leaves of the blue lotus,<br>and with eyes red as the corolla of the lily, and attired in yellow robes<br>with, besides, the bright Kaustubha gem in thy bosom, thou art the<br>beginning and the end of creation, and the great refuge of all. Thou art<br>the supreme light and essence of the Universe! Thy face is directed<br>towards every point. They call thee Supreme Germ and the depository of<br>all treasures. Under thy protections, O lord of the gods, all evils lose<br>their terror. As thou didst protect me before from Dussasana, do thou<br>extricate me now from this difficulty."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "The great and sovereign God, and Lord of the<br>earth, of mysterious movements, the lord Kesava who is ever kind to the<br>dependents, thou adored by Krishna, and perceiving her difficulty,<br>instantly repaired to that place leaving the bed of Rukmini who was<br>sleeping by his side. Beholding Vasudeva, Draupadi bowed down to him in<br>great joy and informed him of the arrival of the Munis and every other<br>thing. And having heard everything Krishna said unto her, 'I am very much<br>afflicted with hunger, do thou give me some food without delay, and then<br>thou mayst go about thy work.' At these words of Kesava, Krishna became<br>confused, and replied unto him, saying, 'The sun-given vessel remains<br>full till I finish my meal. But as I have already taken my meal today,<br>there is no food in it now. Then that lotus-eyed and adorable being said<br>unto Krishna, 'This is no time for jest, O Krishna.&#8212;I am much distressed<br>with hunger, go thou quickly to fetch the vessel and show it to me.' When<br>Kesava, that ornament of the Yadu's race, had the vessel brought unto<br>him,&#8212;with such persistence, he looked into it and saw a particle of rice<br>and vegetable sticking at its rim. And swallowing it he said unto her,<br>'May it please the god Hari, the soul of the Universe, and may that god<br>who partaketh at sacrifices, be satiated with this.' Then the long-armed<br>Krishna, that soother of miseries, said unto Bhimasena, 'Do thou speedily<br>invite the Munis to dinner. Then, O good king, the celebrated Bhimasena<br>quickly went to invite all those Munis, Durvasa and others, who had gone<br>to the nearest stream of transparent and cool water to perform their<br>ablutions. Meanwhile, these ascetics, having plunged into the river, were<br>rubbing their bodies and observing that they all felt their stomachs to<br>be full. And coming out of the stream, they began to stare at one<br>another. And turning towards Durvasa, all those ascetics observed,<br>'Having bade the king make our meals ready, we have come hither for a<br>bath. But how, O regenerate Rishi, can we eat anything now, for our<br>stomachs seem to be full to the throat. The repast hath been uselessly<br>prepared for us. What is the best thing to be done now?' Durvasa replied,<br>'By spoiling the repast, we have done a great wrong to that royal sage,<br>king Yudhishthira. Would not the Pandavas destroy us by looking down upon<br>us with angry eyes? I know the royal sage Yudhishthira to be possessed of<br>great ascetic power. Ye Brahmanas, I am afraid of men that are devoted to<br>Hari. The high-souled Pandavas are all religious men, learned, war-like,<br>diligent in ascetic austerities and religious observances, devoted to<br>Vasudeva, and always observant of rules of good conduct. If provoked,<br>they can consume us with their wrath as fire doth a bale of cotton.<br>Therefore, ye disciples, do ye all run away quickly without seeing them<br>(again)!"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "All those Brahmanas, thus advised by their<br>ascetic preceptor, became greatly afraid of the Pandavas and fled away in<br>all directions. Then Bhimasena not beholding those excellent Munis in the<br>celestial river, made a search after them here and there at all the<br>landing places. And learning from the ascetics of those places that they<br>had run away, he came back and informed Yudhishthira of what had<br>happened. Then all the Pandavas of subdued senses, expecting them to<br>come, remained awaiting their arrival for some time. And Yudhishthira<br>said, 'Coming dead of night the Rishis will deceive us. Oh how, can we<br>escape from this difficulty created by the facts?' Seeing them absorbed<br>in such reflections and breathing long deep sighs at frequent intervals,<br>the illustrious Krishna suddenly appeared to them and addressed them<br>these words: 'Knowing, ye sons of Pritha, your danger from that wrathful<br>Rishi, I was implored by Draupadi to come, and (therefore) have I come<br>here speedily. But now ye have not the least fear from the Rishi Durvasa.<br>Afraid of your ascetic powers, he hath made himself scarce ere this.<br>Virtuous men never suffer. I now ask your permission to let me return<br>home. May you always be prosperous!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Hearing Kesava's words, the sons of Pritha, with<br>Draupadi, became easy in mind. And cured of their fever (of anxiety),<br>they said unto him, 'As persons drowning in the wide ocean safely reach<br>the shore by means of a boat, so have we, by thy aid, O lord Govinda,<br>escaped from this inextricable difficulty. Do thou now depart in peace,<br>and may prosperity be thine.' Thus dismissed, he repaired to his capital<br>and the Pandavas too, O blessed lord, wandering from forest to forest<br>passed their days merrily with Draupadi. Thus, O king, have I related to<br>thee the story which thou askedest me to repeat. And it was thus that the<br>machinations of the wicked sons of Dhritarashtra about the Pandavas in<br>the forest, were frustrated."
