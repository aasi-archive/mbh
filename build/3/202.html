                            "Markandeya said, 'Thus addressed by Utanka, that unvanquished royal<br>sage, with joined hands, O thou foremost of the Kuru race, replied unto<br>Utanka, saying, 'This visit of thine, O Brahmana, will not be in vain.<br>This my son, O holy one, known by the name of Kuvalaswa is endued with<br>steadiness and activity. In prowess also he is unequalled on earth.<br>Without doubt he will accomplish all this that is agreeable to thee,<br>aided by all his brave sons endued with arms like unto iron maces. Give<br>me leave to retire, O Brahmana, for I have now given up my weapons.' Thus<br>addressed by the king, that Muni of immeasurable energy replied unto him,<br>saying, 'So be it." And the royal sage Vrihadaswa then, having commended<br>his son to obey the behest of the high-souled Utanka saying, 'Let it be<br>done by thee,' himself retired into an excellent forest.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O holy one, O thou possessed of the wealth of<br>asceticism, who was this Daitya of great energy? Whose son and whose<br>grandson was he? I desire to know all this; O thou possessed of the<br>wealth of asceticism I never heard of this mighty Daitya before. I desire<br>to know all this truly, O holy one, and with all particulars in detail, O<br>thou of great wisdom and ascetic wealth!'<br><br>"Markandeya said, 'O monarch, know everything as it happened, O ruler of<br>men, as I narrate the particulars truly, O thou of great wisdom! When the<br>world became one broad expanse of water and creatures mobile and immobile<br>were destroyed, when, O bull of the Bharata race, the entire creation<br>came to its end. He who is the Source and Creator of the Universe, viz.,<br>the Eternal and unfading Vishnu, He who is called by Munis crowned with<br>ascetic success as the Supreme Lord of the Universe, that Being of great<br>holiness, then lay in Yoga sleep on the wide hood of the Snake Sesha of<br>immeasurable energy, and the Creator of the Universe, that highly-blessed<br>and holy Hari, knowing no deterioration, lay on the hood of that Snake<br>encircling the whole Earth and as the Deity lay asleep on that bed, a<br>lotus, endued with great beauty and effulgence equal unto that of the<br>Sun, sprang from his navel. And from that lotus possessed of effulgence<br>like unto the Sun's, sprang the Grandsire Brahma, that lord of the worlds<br>who is the four Vedas, who hath four forms and four faces, who is<br>invincible in consequence of his own energy and who is endued with mighty<br>strength and great prowess and as the Lord Hari of wondrous frame,<br>possessed of great lustre and decked with a crown and the Kaustubha gem<br>and attired in purple silk, lay stretched for many a yojana on that<br>excellent bed furnished by the hood of the snake itself extending far and<br>wide, blazing, O king, in his beauty and the lustre of his own body like<br>a thousand Suns concentrated in one mass. He was beheld some time after<br>by two Danavas of great prowess named Madhu and Kaitabha and beholding<br>Hari (in that posture) and the Grandsire with eyes like lotus-leaves<br>seated on that lotus, both Madhu and Kaitabha wandered much and they<br>began to terrify and alarm Brahma of immeasurable prowess, and the<br>illustrious Brahma alarmed by their continued exertions trembled on his<br>seat, and at his trembling the stalk of the lotus on which he was seated<br>began to tremble and when the lotus-stalk trembled, Kesava awoke. And<br>awakened from his slumber, Govinda beheld those Danavas of mighty energy,<br>and beholding them the Deity said unto them, 'Welcome, ye mighty ones! I<br>am gratified with you! Therefore, I will grant you excellent boons!' And<br>thereupon both those proud and mighty Danavas, O king, laughingly replied<br>unto Hrishikesa, saying, 'Ask boons of us, O Divine one! O thou that art<br>the Supreme Deity, we are disposed to grant thee a boon. Indeed, we will<br>grant thee a boon! Therefore, ask thou of us anything that cometh to thy<br>mind.' Thus addressed by them the holy one spoke, 'Ye brave ones, I will<br>accept a boon from you. There is a boon that I desire. Both of you are<br>possessed of mighty energy. There is no male person like unto any of you.<br>O ye of unbaffled prowess, submit ye to be slain by me. Even that is what<br>I desire to accomplish for the good of the world.' Hearing these words of<br>the Deity, both Madhu and Kaitabha said, 'We have never before spoken an<br>untruth; no, not even in jest; what shall we say of other occasions! O<br>thou foremost of male Beings, know that we have ever been firm in truth<br>and morality. In strength, in forms, in beauty, in virtue, in asceticism,<br>in charity, in behaviour, in goodness, in self control, there is no one<br>equal unto either of us. A great danger, O Kesava, hath approached us.<br>Accomplish thou, therefore, what thou hast said. No one can prevail over<br>Time. But, O Lord, there is one thing that we desire to be done by thee.<br>O thou best and foremost of all Deities, thou must slay us at a spot that<br>is absolutely uncovered. And, O thou of excellent eyes, we also desire to<br>become thy sons. This is the boon that we desire, know then, O chief of<br>the gods! Let not that O Deity, be false which thou hadst at first<br>promised to us.' The Holy One then replied unto them saying, 'Yes, I will<br>do as ye desire. Everything will be as ye wish!'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Then Govinda began to reflect but uncovered space<br>found he none and when he could not discover any spot that was uncovered<br>on earth or in the sky, that foremost Deity then beheld his thighs to be<br>absolutely uncovered. And there, O king, the illustrious Deity cut off<br>the heads of Madhu and Kaitabha with his keenedged discus!'"
