                            "Pulastya said, 'Arriving next at the excellent tirtha called Samvedya in<br>the evening, and touching its waters, one surely obtaineth knowledge.<br>Created a tirtha in days of yore by Rama's energy, he that proceedeth to<br>Lauhitya obtaineth the merit of giving away gold in abundance. Proceeding<br>next to the river Karatoya, and fasting there for three nights, a man<br>acquireth the merit of the horse-sacrifice. Even this is the injunction<br>of the Creator himself. It hath been said by the wise, O king, that if a<br>person goeth to the spot where the Ganga mingleth with the sea, he<br>reapeth merit which is ten times that of the horse-sacrifice. Crossing<br>over to the opposite bank of the Ganga, he that batheth there having<br>resided for three nights is, O king, cleansed from all his sins. One<br>should next proceed to the Vaitarani capable of destroying every sin.<br>Arriving next at the tirtha named Viraja one shineth like the moon, and<br>sanctifying his race rescueth it and is himself cleansed of all his sins.<br>He that bathes in Viraja further reapeth the merit of giving away a<br>thousand kine besides sanctifying his line. Residing with purity at the<br>confluence of the Sona and the Jyotirathi, and offering oblations of<br>water to the gods and the Pitris, a man reapeth the merit of the<br>Agnishtoma sacrifice. Touching next the waters of the Vansagulma<br>constituting the sources of both the Sona and the Narmada, one obtaineth<br>the merit of the horse-sacrifice. Sojourning next to the tirtha called<br>Rishabha in Kosala, O lord of men, and fasting there for three nights one<br>earneth the merit of the Vajapeya sacrifice, and of the gift of a<br>thousand kine, and also delivereth his race. Arriving at Kosala, a man<br>should bathe in the tirtha named Kala. By this one surely obtaineth the<br>merit of giving away one and ten bulls. By bathing in Pushpavati and<br>fasting there, O king, for three nights one sanctifieth his own race,<br>besides earning the merit of the gift of a thousand kine. Then, O<br>foremost of the Bharata race, by bathing in the tirtha called Vadarika,<br>one obtaineth long life, and also goeth to heaven. Arriving next at<br>Champa, and bathing in the Bhagirathi, and seeing Danda one earneth the<br>merit of giving away a thousand kine. Then should one go to the sacred<br>Lapetika, graced by the presence of the pious. By so doing one reapeth<br>the merit of the Vajapeya sacrifice and also becometh regarded by the<br>gods. Proceeding next to the mountain called Mahendra, inhabited (of<br>yore) by Jamadagnya, and bathing in Rama's tirtha, a person acquireth the<br>merit of the horse-sacrifice. Here is Matanga's tirtha called Kedara, O<br>son of the Kuru race! Bathing in it, O foremost of the Kurus, a man<br>obtaineth the merit of giving away a thousand kine. Going to the mountain<br>Sree, one who toucheth the waters of the stream that is there by<br>worshipping there the god having the bull for his mark obtaineth the<br>merit of the horse-sacrifice. On the mountain Sree dwelleth happily, the<br>effulgent Mahadeva with the goddess, as also Brahma with the other gods.<br>By bathing in the lake of Deva, with purity and restrained mind, one<br>obtaineth the merit of the-horse-sacrifice, and also attaineth to the<br>highest success."'<br><br>Proceeding next to the mountain Rishabha in Pandya, worshipped by the<br>gods, one obtains the merit of the Vajapeya sacrifice and rejoices in<br>heaven. One should next proceed to the river Kaveri, frequented by<br>Apsaras. Bathing there, O monarch, one obtaineth, the merit of giving<br>away a thousand kine. Touching next the waters of the tirtha called Kanya<br>on the shores of the sea one is cleansed from every sin. Proceeding next<br>to Gokarna celebrated over the three worlds, and which is situate, O best<br>of kings, in the midst of the deep, and is reverenced by all the worlds,<br>and where the gods headed by Brahma, and Rishis endued with wealth of<br>asceticism, and spirits and Yakshas and Pisachas, and Kinnaras and the<br>great Nagas, and Siddhas and Charanas and Gandharvas, and men and<br>Pannagas, and rivers, Seas and Mountains, worship the lord of Uma, one<br>should worship Isana, fasting there for three nights. By this, one<br>acquireth the merit of the horse-sacrifice, and the status of Ganapatya.<br>By staying there for twelve nights, one's soul is cleansed of all sins.<br>One should next proceed to the tirtha known as Gayatri celebrated over<br>the three worlds. Staying there for three nights, one acquireth the merit<br>of giving away a thousand kine. A strange phenomenon is seen to occur<br>there in respect to Brahmanas, O Lord of men! If a Brahmana, whether born<br>of a Brahmani or any other woman, reciteth the Gayatri there, the<br>recitation becomes rhythmic and musical, while, O king, a person who is<br>not a Brahmana cannot adequately hymn it at all. Proceeding next to the<br>inaccessible tank of the Brahmana Rishi Samvarta, one acquireth personal<br>beauty and prosperity. Repairing next to Vena, he that offers oblations<br>of water to the gods and the Pitris, obtains a car drawn by peacocks and<br>cranes. Going next to the Godavari, ever frequented by the Siddhas, one<br>earneth the merit of the cow-sacrifice, and goeth to the excellent region<br>of Vasuki. Bathing next at the confluence of the Venna, one obtains the<br>merit of the Vajapeya sacrifice. By a dip next at the confluence of<br>Varada, one acquireth the merit of giving away a thousand kine. Arriving<br>next at Brahmasthuna, one that stayeth there for three nights acquireth<br>the merit of giving away a thousand kine, and also ascendeth to heaven.<br>Coming next to Kusaplavana, with subdued soul and leading a Brahmacharya<br>mode of life, and staying there for three nights he that bathes in it<br>obtains the merit of the horse-sacrifice. Bathing next at the romantic<br>Deva-hrada that is supplied by the waters of the Krishna-Venna, and also<br>in the Jatismara-hrada, one acquireth the memory of one's former life. It<br>was there that the chief of the celestials celebrated a hundred<br>sacrifices and ascended to heaven. By a visit only to that spot, one<br>acquireth the merit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. Bathing next in the<br>Sarvadeva-hrada, a person obtaineth the merit of giving away a thousand<br>kine. Proceeding next to the highly sacred tank called Payoshni, that<br>best of waters, he that offers oblations of water to the gods and the<br>Pitris acquires the merit of the gift of a thousand kine. Arriving next<br>at the sacred forest of Dandaka, a person should bathe (in the waters)<br>there. By this, O king, one at once obtains, O Bharata, the merit of<br>giving away a thousand kine. Proceeding next to the asylum of Sarabhanga<br>and that of the illustrious Suka, one acquireth immunity from misfortune,<br>besides sanctifying his race. Then should one proceed to Surparaka, where<br>Jamadagni's son had formerly dwelt. Bathing in that tirtha of Rama, one<br>acquireth the merit of giving away gold in abundance. Bathing next in the<br>Saptagadavara, with the subdued sense and regulated diet, one earneth<br>great merit, and goeth also to the region of the celestials. Proceeding<br>next to Deva-hrada, with subdued sense and regulated diet, a man<br>obtaineth the merit of the Devasatra sacrifice. One should proceed next<br>to the forest of Tungaka, with subdued senses and leading a Brahmacharya<br>mode of life It was here that in olden days Muni Saraswata taught the<br>Vedas to the ascetics. When the Vedas had been lost (in consequence of<br>the Munis having forgotten them), Angirasa's son, seated at ease on the<br>upper garments of the Munis (duly spread out), pronounced distinctly and<br>with emphasis the syllable Om. And at this, the ascetics again<br>recollected all that they had learnt before. It was there that the Rishis<br>and the gods Varuna, Agni, Prajapati, Narayana also called Hari, Mahadeva<br>and the illustrious Grandsire of great splendour, appointed the<br>resplendent Bhrigu to officiate at a sacrifice. Gratifying Agni by<br>libations of clarified butter poured according to the ordinance, the<br>illustrious Bhrigu once performed the Agnyadhana sacrifice for all those<br>Rishis, after which both they and the gods went away to their respective<br>homes one after another. One who enters the forest of Tungaka, is, O best<br>of kings, male or female, cleansed of every sin. There in that tirtha, O<br>hero, one should reside for a month, with subdued senses and regulated<br>diet. By this, O king, one ascendeth to the region of Brahma, and<br>delivereth also his race. Arriving next at Medhavika, one should offer<br>oblations of water to the gods and the Pitris. By this, one acquires the<br>merit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice, and also memory and intellect. There<br>in that tirtha is the mountain known over the whole world and called<br>Kalanjara. Bathing in the celestial lake that is there, one acquires the<br>merit of giving away a thousand kine. He that, O king, after a bath,<br>offereth oblations (to the gods and the Pitris) on the Kalanjara<br>mountain, is, without doubt, regarded in heaven. Proceeding next, O<br>monarch, to the river Mandakini capable of destroying all sins and which<br>is on that best of mountains called Chitrakuta, he that bathes there and<br>worships the gods and the Pitris, obtains the merit of the<br>horse-sacrifice and attains to an exalted state. One should next, O<br>virtuous one, proceed to the excellent tirtha called Bhartristhana,<br>where, O king, ever dwells the celestial generalissimo Kartikeya. By a<br>journey only to that spot, a person, O foremost of kings, attaineth to<br>success. Bathing next at the tirtha called Koti, one earneth the merit of<br>giving away a thousand kine. Having walked round Koti, one should proceed<br>next to Jyeshthasthana. Beholding Mahadeva who is there, one shineth like<br>the moon. There, O mighty monarch, is a celebrated well. O bull of the<br>Bharata race! There in that well, O foremost of warriors, are the four<br>seas. He that bathes there, O foremost of kings, and with subdued soul<br>worships the gods and the Pitris, is cleansed of all his sins and<br>attaineth to an exalted state. Then, O mighty king, should one proceed to<br>the great Sringaverapura, where, O foremost of kings, formerly Rama,<br>Dasharatha's son, had crossed (the Ganga). Bathing in that tirtha, one, O<br>mighty-armed one, is cleansed of all his sins. Bathing with subdued<br>senses and leading a Brahmacharya mode of life, in the Ganga, one is<br>cleansed of every sin, and obtains also the merit of the Vajapeya<br>sacrifice. One should next proceed to the place called Mayuravata,<br>consecrated to Mahadeva of high intelligence. Beholding there the god,<br>bowing down to him and walking round the spot, one acquireth, O Bharata,<br>the Ganapatya status. Bathing in Ganga at that tirtha, one is cleansed of<br>all his sins. Then, O king, should one proceed to Prayaga, whose praises<br>have been sung by Rishis and where dwell the gods with Brahma at their<br>head, the Directions with their presiding deities, the Lokapalas, the<br>Siddhas, the Pitris adored by the worlds, the great Rishis-Sanatkumara<br>and others, stainless Brahmarshis&#8212;Angiras and others,&#8212;the Nagas, the<br>Suparnas, the Siddhas, the Snakes, the Rivers, the Seas, the Gandharvas,<br>the Apsaras, and the Lord Hari with Prajapati. There in that tirtha are<br>three fiery caverns between which the Ganga, that foremost of tirthas,<br>rolleth rapidly. There in that region also the world-purifying daughter<br>of the sun, Yamuna, celebrated over the three worlds, uniteth with the<br>Ganga. The country between the Ganga and the Yamuna is regarded as the<br>mons veneris of the world, and Prayaga as the foremost point of that<br>region. The tirthas Prayaga, Pratisthana, Kamvala, Aswatara and Bhogavati<br>are the sacrificial platforms of the Creator. There in those places, O<br>foremost of warriors, the Vedas and the Sacrifices, in embodied forms,<br>and the Rishis endued with wealth of asceticism, adore Brahma, and there<br>the gods and rulers of territories also celebrate their sacrifices. The<br>learned, however, say that of all these tirthas, O exalted one, Prayaga<br>is the most sacred, in fact, the foremost of all tirthas in the three<br>worlds. By going to that tirtha, by singing its praises, or by taking a<br>little earth from it, one is cleansed from every sin. He that bathes in<br>that confluence celebrated over the world, acquires all the merits of the<br>Rajasuya and the horse-sacrifices. This sacrificial place is worshipped<br>by the gods themselves. If a man giveth there ever so little, it<br>increaseth, O Bharata, a thousandfold. O child, let not the texts of the<br>Veda, nor the opinions of men dissuade thy mind from the desire of dying<br>at Prayaga. O son of the Kuru race, the wise say that six hundred million<br>and ten thousand tirthas exist at Prayaga. Bathing in the confluence of<br>Ganga and Yamuna, one obtains the merit that attaches to the four kinds<br>of knowledge and the merits also of those that are truthful. There at<br>Prayaga is the excellent tirtha of Vasuki called Bhogavati. He that<br>batheth in it, obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice. There also in<br>the Ganga is the tirtha famed over the three worlds, called<br>Ramaprapatana, which conferreth the merit of ten horse-sacrifices. O son<br>of the Kuru race! Wherever may a person bathe in the Ganga, he earneth<br>merit equal to that of a trip to Kurukshetra. An exception, however, is<br>made in favour of Kanakhala, while the merit attaching to Prayaga is the<br>greatest. Having committed a hundred sins, he that bathes in the Ganga,<br>hath all his sins washed off by the waters thereof, even as fuel is<br>consumed by fire. It hath been said that in the Satyayuga all the tirthas<br>were sacred; in the Treta, Pushkara alone was such; in Dwapara,<br>Kurukshetra; and in the Kali-yuga, the Ganga alone is sacred. In<br>Pushkara, one should practise austerities; in Mahalaya, one should give<br>away; in the Malaya mountains, one should ascend the funeral pyre; and in<br>Bhrigutunga, one should renounce one's body by forgoing food. Bathing in<br>Pushkara, in Kurukshetra, in the Ganga and in the confluence (of the<br>Ganga and the Yamuna), one sanctifieth seven generations of one's race up<br>and down. He that reciteth the name of the Ganga is purified; while he<br>that beholdeth her, receiveth prosperity; while he that bathes in her and<br>drinks of her waters sanctifieth seven generations of his race up and<br>down. As long, O king, as one's bones lie in contact with the waters of<br>the Ganga, so long doth he live regarded in heaven, even as one liveth in<br>heaven in consequence of the merit he earneth by pious pilgrimages to<br>sacred tirthas and holy spots. There is no tirtha that is like unto the<br>Ganga, there is no god like unto Kesava, and there is none superior to<br>Brahmanas,&#8212;this hath been said even by the Grandsire. O great king, the<br>region through which the Ganga flows should be regarded as a sacred<br>asylum, and a spot of land that is on the Ganga's banks, should be<br>regarded as one favourable to the attainment of ascetic success.<br><br>This truthful description (of the tirthas) one should recite only unto<br>the regenerate ones, unto those that are pious, unto one's son and<br>friends and disciples and dependents. This narrative, without a rival, is<br>blessed and holy and leadeth to heaven. Holy and entertaining and<br>sanctifying, it is productive of merit and high worth. Destructive of<br>every sin, it is a mystery that the great Rishis cherish with care. By<br>reciting it in the midst of Brahmanas, one is cleansed of every sin, and<br>ascends to heaven. This description of tirthas is auspicious and<br>heaven-giving and sacred; ever blessed as it is, it destroys one's<br>enemies; foremost of all accounts, it sharpens the intellect. By reading<br>this narrative the sonless obtains sons, the destitute obtains riches, a<br>person of the royal order conquereth the whole earth, the Vaisya cometh<br>by wealth, the Sudra obtaineth all his desires, and the Brahmana crosseth<br>the ocean (of the world). Purifying himself, he that listens daily to the<br>merits of the different tirthas, recollects the incidents of many<br>previous births and rejoices in heaven. Of the tirthas that have been<br>recited here, some are easily accessible, while others are difficult of<br>access. But he that is inspired with the desire of beholding all tirthas,<br>should visit them even in imagination. Desirous of obtaining merit, the<br>Vasus, and the Sadhyas, the Adityas, the Maruts, the Aswins, and the<br>Rishis equal unto celestials, all bathed in these tirthas. Do thou also,<br>O thou of the Kuru race, observing the ordinance as explained by me,<br>visit, with subdued senses, these tirthas, increasing thy merit, O thou<br>of excellent vows. Men of piety and learning are able to visit these<br>tirthas, by reason of their purified senses, their belief in Godhead, and<br>their acquaintance with the Vedas. He that doth not observe vows, he that<br>hath not his soul under control, he that is impure, he that is a thief,<br>and he that is of crooked mind, doth not, O Kauravya, bathe in tirthas.<br>Thou art ever observant of virtue, and art of pure character. By thy<br>virtue, O virtuous one, thou hast always gratified thy father and thy<br>grand-father, and great-grand-fathers, and the gods with Brahma at their<br>head, and the Rishis also, O thou versed in virtue! Thou who resemblest<br>Vasava, thou wilt, O Bhishma, attain to the region of the Vasus, and also<br>eternal fame on earth!'<br><br>"Narada continued, 'Having cheerfully spoken thus, the illustrious Rishi<br>Pulastya, well-pleased, bidding Bhishma farewell, disappeared there and<br>then. And Bhishma also, O tiger among men, well understanding the true<br>import of the Shastras, wandered over the world at the command of<br>Pulastya. Thus, O thou blessed one, did Bhishma end at Prayaga his highly<br>meritorious journey to the tirthas capable of destroying all sins. The<br>man that ranges the earth in accordance with these injunctions, obtains<br>the highest fruit of a hundred horse-sacrifices and earns salvation<br>hereafter. Thou wilt, O son of Pritha, obtain merit consisting of the<br>eight attributes, even like that which Bhishma, the foremost of the<br>Kurus, had obtained of yore. And as thou wilt lead these ascetics to<br>those tirthas, thy merit will be much greater. Those tirthas are infested<br>by Rakshasas, and no one, save thyself, O son of Kuru race, can go there.<br>Rising early he that reciteth this narrative by the celestial Rishis on<br>the subject of the tirthas, becometh free from all sins. Those foremost<br>of Rishis, Valmiki, and Kasyapa, and Atreya, and Kundajathara, and<br>Viswamitra, and Gautama, and Asita, and Devala, and Markandeya, and<br>Galava, and Bharadwaja, and Vasishtha, and the Muni Uddalaka, and Saunaka<br>with his son, and Vyasa, that best of ascetics, and Durvasas, that<br>foremost of Munis, and Javali of great austerities&#8212;all these illustrious<br>Rishis endued with wealth of asceticism, are staying in expectation of<br>thee. With these, O mighty king, do thou meet by visiting these tirthas.<br>And, O illustrious monarch, a great Rishi of immeasurable energy, Lomasa<br>by name, will come to thee. Do thou follow him, and me, and by turns<br>visit these tirthas, O thou virtuous one! By this, thou wilt acquire<br>great fame, like king Mahabhisha! O tiger among kings, even as the<br>virtuous Yayati and king Pururavas, dost thou blaze forth with thy own<br>virtue. Like king Bhagiratha and the illustrious Rama, dost thou shine<br>among kings even as the Sun himself. And thou art, O great king,<br>celebrated (in the world) even as Muni or Ikshwaku, or the highly famous<br>Puru or Vainya! And as in days of yore the slayer of Vritra, after<br>burning all his foes, ruled the three worlds, his mind freed from<br>anxiety, so wilt thou rule thy subjects, after slaying all thy enemies.<br>And, O thou of eyes like lotus leaves, having conquered the earth<br>according to the customs of thy order, thou wilt obtain renown by thy<br>virtue, even like Kartaviryaryuna.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "O great king, having comforted the monarch thus,<br>the illustrious Rishi Narada, bidding farewell to the king, disappeared<br>there and then. And the virtuous Yudhishthira, reflecting upon the<br>subject, began to recite unto the ascetics the merit attaching to<br>tirthas!"
