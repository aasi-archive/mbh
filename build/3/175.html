                            Janamejaya said, "When that prime among heroes, having been accomplished<br>in arms, had returned from the abode of the slayer of Vritra, what did<br>Pritha's sons do in company with the warlike Dhananjaya?"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "In company with that hero equal unto Indra,<br>Arjuna&#8212;that foremost of men, sported in the pleasure-gardens of the lord<br>of treasures (situated) in those woods on that romantic and excellent<br>mountain. And surveying those peerless and various pleasure-grounds<br>filled with diverse trees, that chief of men, Kiriti, ever intent upon<br>arms, ranged at large, bow in hand. And having through the grace of king<br>Vaisravana obtained a residence, those sons of a sovereign cared not for<br>the prosperity of men. And, O king, that period of their (lives) passed<br>peacefully. And having Partha in their company, they spent four years<br>there even like a single night. And as the Pandavas lived in the wood,<br>(these four years) and the former six, numbering ten, passed smoothly<br>with them.<br><br>"Then having seated themselves before the king, the vehement son of the<br>Wind-god, with Jishnu and the heroic twins, like unto the lord of the<br>celestials, earnestly addressed the king in these beneficial and pleasant<br>words. 'It is only to render thy promise effectual and to advance thy<br>interests, that, O king of the Kurus, forsaking the forest, we do not go<br>to slay Suyodhana together with all his followers. Although deserving of<br>happiness, yet have we been deprived of happiness. And this is the<br>eleventh year that (in this state) we have been living (in the forest).<br>And hereafter, deluding that one of evil mind and character, shall we<br>easily live out the period of non-discovery. And at thy mandate, O<br>monarch, free from apprehension, we have been ranging the woods, having<br>relinquished our honour. Having been tempted by our residence in the<br>vicinity, they (our enemies) will not believe that we have removed to a<br>distant realm. And after having lived there undiscovered for a year, and<br>having wreaked our revenge on that wicked wight, Suyodhana, with his<br>followers, we shall easily root out that meanest of men, slaying him and<br>regaining our kingdom. Therefore, O Dharmaraja, do thou descend unto the<br>earth. For, O king, if we dwell in this region like unto heaven itself,<br>we shall forget our sorrows. In that case, O Bharata, thy fame like, unto<br>a fragrant flower shall vanish from the mobile and the immobile worlds.<br>By gaining that kingdom of the Kuru chiefs, thou wilt be able to attain<br>(great glory), and to perform various sacrifices. This that thou art<br>receiving from Kuvera, thou wilt, O foremost of men, be able to attain<br>any time. Now, O Bharata, turn thy mind towards the punishment and<br>destruction of foes that committed wrongs. O king, the wielder of the<br>thunderbolt himself is incapable of standing thy prowess. And intent upon<br>thy welfare, he, having Suparna for his mark (Krishna), and also the<br>grandson of Sini (Satyaki) never experience pain, even when engaged in<br>encounter with the gods, O Dharmaraja. And Arjuna is peerless in<br>strength, and so am I too, O best of kings. And as Krishna together with<br>the Yadavas is intent upon thy welfare, so am I also, O foremost of<br>monarchs, and the heroic twins accomplished in war. And encountering the<br>enemy, we, having for our main object the attainment by thee of wealth<br>and prosperity, will destroy them.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Then having learnt that intention of theirs, the<br>magnanimous and excellent son of Dharma, versed in religion and profit,<br>and of immeasurable prowess, went round Vaisravana's abode. And<br>Yudhishthira the just, after bidding adieu unto the palaces, the rivers,<br>the lakes, and all the Rakshasas, looked towards the way by which (he)<br>had come (there). And then looking at the mountain also, the high-souled<br>and pure-minded one besought that best of mountains, saying, 'O foremost<br>of mountains, may I together with my friends, after having finished my<br>task, and slain my foes, and regained my kingdom, see thee again,<br>carrying on austerities with subdued soul.' And this also he determined<br>on. And in company with his younger brothers and the Brahmanas, the lord<br>of the Kurus proceeded even along that very road. And Ghatotkacha with<br>his followers began to carry them over the mountain cascades. And as they<br>started, the great sage Lomasa, advising them even as a father doth his<br>son, with a cheerful heart, went unto the sacred abode of the dwellers of<br>heaven. Then advised also by Arshtishena, those first of men, the<br>Parthas, went alone beholding romantic tirthas and hermitages, and other<br>mighty lakes."
