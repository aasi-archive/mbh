                            Vaisampayana said, "O represser of foes, hearing these words of the<br>intelligent monkey-chief, the heroic Bhima answered, 'Who art thou? And<br>why also hast thou assumed the shape of a monkey? It is a Kshatriya&#8212;one<br>of a race next to the Brahmanas&#8212;that asketh thee. And he belongeth to<br>the Kuru race and the lunar stock, and was borne by Kunti in her womb,<br>and is one of the sons of Pandu, and is the off spring of the wind-god,<br>and is known by the name of Bhimasena.' Hearing these words of the Kuru<br>hero, Hanuman smiled, and that son of the wind-god (Hanuman) spake unto<br>that offspring of the wind-god (Bhimasena), saying, 'I am a monkey, I<br>will not allow thee the passage thou desirest. Better desist and go back.<br>Do thou not meet with destruction.' At this Bhimasena replied.<br>'Destruction at anything else do I not ask thee about, O monkey. Do thou<br>give me passage. Arise! Do not come by grief at my hands.' Hanuman said,<br>'I have no strength to rise; I am suffering from illness. If go thou<br>must, do thou go by overleaping me.' Bhima said, 'The Supreme Soul void<br>of the properties pervadeth a body all over. Him knowable alone by<br>knowledge, I cannot disregard. And therefore, will I not overleap thee.<br>If I had not known Him from Whom become manifest all creatures, I would<br>have leapt over thee and also the mountain, even as Hanuman had bounded<br>over the ocean.' Thereupon Hanuman said, 'Who is that Hanuman, who had<br>bounded over the ocean? I ask thee, O best of men. Relate if thou canst.'<br>Bhima replied, "He is even my brother, excellent with every perfection,<br>and endued with intelligence and strength both of mind and body. And he<br>is the illustrious chief of monkeys, renowned in the Ramayana. And for<br>Rama's queen, that king of the monkeys even with one leap crossed the<br>ocean extending over a hundred yojanas. That mighty one is my brother. I<br>am equal unto him in energy, strength and prowess and also in fight. And<br>able am I to punish thee. So arise. Either give me passage or witness my<br>prowess to-day. If thou do not listen to my bidding, I shall send thee to<br>the abode of Yama."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued. "Then knowing him (Bhima) to be intoxicated with<br>strength, and proud of the might of his arms, Hanuman, slighting him at<br>heart, said the following words, 'Relent thou, O sinless one. In<br>consequence of age, I have no strength to get up. From pity for me, do<br>thou go, moving aside my tail.' Being thus addressed by Hanuman, Bhima<br>proud of the strength of his arms, took him for one wanting in energy and<br>prowess, and thought within himself, 'Taking fast hold of the tail, will<br>I send this monkey destitute of energy and prowess, to the region of<br>Yama.' Thereat, with a smile he slightingly took hold of the tail with<br>his left hand; but could not move that tail of the mighty monkey. Then<br>with both arms he pulled it, resembling the pole reared in honour of<br>Indra. Still the mighty Bhima could not raise the tail with both his<br>arms. And his eye-brows were contracted up, and his eyes rolled, and his<br>face was contracted into wrinkles and his body was covered with sweat;<br>and yet he could not raise it. And when after having striven, the<br>illustrious Bhima failed in raising the tail, he approached the side of<br>the monkey, and stood with a bashful countenance. And bowing down,<br>Kunti's son, with joined hands, spake these words, 'Relent thou, O<br>foremost of monkeys; and forgive me for my harsh words. Art thou a<br>Siddha, or a god, or a Gandharva, or a Guhyaka? I ask thee out of<br>curiosity. Tell me who thou art that hast assumed the shape of monkey, if<br>it be not a secret, O long-armed one, and if I can well hear it. I ask<br>thee as a disciple, and I, O sinless one, seek thy refuge.' Thereupon<br>Hanuman said, 'O represser of foes, even to the extent of thy curiosity<br>to know me, shall I relate all at length. Listen, O son of Pandu! O<br>lotus-eyed one, I was begotten by the wind-god that life of the<br>world&#8212;upon the wife of Kesari. I am a monkey, by name Hanuman. All the<br>mighty monkey-kings, and monkey-chiefs used to wait upon that son of the<br>sun, Sugriva, and that son of Sakra, Vali. And, O represser of foes, a<br>friendship subsisted between me and Sugriva, even as between the wind and<br>fire. And for some cause, Sugriva, driven out by his brother, for a long<br>time dwelt with me at the Hrisyamukh. And it came to pass that the mighty<br>son of Dasaratha the heroic Rama, who is Vishnu's self in the shape of a<br>human being, took his birth in this world. And in company with his queen<br>and brother, taking his bow, that foremost of bowmen with the view of<br>compassing his father's welfare, began to reside in the Dandaka forest.<br>And from Janasthana, that mighty Rakshasa monarch, the wicked Ravana,<br>carried away his (Rama's) queen by stratagem and force, deceiving, O<br>sinless one, that foremost of men, through the agency of a Rakshasa,<br>Maricha, who assumed the form of a deer marked with gem-like and golden<br>spots."
