                            "Markandeya continued, 'O sinless scion of Kuru's race, I have described<br>to thee the various branches of the race of Agni. Listen now to the story<br>of the birth of the intelligent Kartikeya. I shall tell thee of that<br>wonderful and famous and highly energetic son of the Adbhuta fire<br>begotten of the wives of the Brahmarshis. In ancient times the gods and<br>Asuras were very active in destroying one another. And the terrible<br>Asuras always succeeded in defeating the gods. And Purandara (Indra)<br>beholding the great slaughter of his armies by them and anxious to find<br>out a leader for the celestial host, thought within himself, 'I must find<br>out a mighty person who observing the ranks of the celestial army<br>shattered by the Danavas will be able to reorganize it with vigour.' He<br>then repaired to the Manasa mountains and was there deeply absorbed in<br>thought of nature, when he heard the heart-rending cries of a woman to<br>the effect, 'May some one come quick and rescue me, and either indicate a<br>husband for me, or be my husband himself.' Purandara said to her, 'Do not<br>be afraid, lady!' And having said these words, he saw Kesin (an Asura)<br>adorned with a crown and mace in hand standing even like a hill of metals<br>at a distance and holding that lady by the hand. Vasava addressed then<br>that Asura saying, 'Why art thou bent on behaving insolently to this<br>lady? Know that I am the god who wields the thunderbolt. Refrain thou<br>from doing any violence to this lady.' To him Kesin replied, 'Do thou, O<br>Sakra, leave her alone. I desire to possess her. Thinkest thou, O slayer<br>of Paka, that thou shalt be able to return home with thy life?' With<br>these words Kesin hurled his mace for slaying Indra. Vasava cut it up in<br>its course with his thunderbolt. Then Kesin, furious with rage, hurled a<br>huge mass of rock at him. Beholding that, he of a hundred sacrifices rent<br>it asunder with his thunderbolt, and it fell down upon the ground. And<br>Kesin himself was wounded by that falling mass of rock. Thus sorely<br>afflicted, he fled leaving the lady behind. And when the Asura was gone,<br>Indra said to that lady, 'Who and whose wife art thou, O lady with a<br>beautiful face, and what has brought thee here?'"
