                            Vaisampayana continued, "Dwelling in the woods, O bull of the Bharata<br>race, the high-souled Pandavas spent one and ten years in a miserable<br>plight. And although deserving of happiness, those foremost of men,<br>brooding over their circumstances, passed their days miserably, living on<br>fruits and roots. And that royal sage, the mighty-armed Yudhishthira,<br>reflecting that the extremity of misery that had befallen his brothers,<br>was owing to his own fault, and remembering those sufferings that had<br>arisen from his act of gambling, could not sleep peacefully. And he felt<br>as if his heart had been pierced with a lance. And remembering the harsh<br>words of the Suta's son, the Pandava, repressing the venom of his wrath,<br>passed his time in humble guise, sighing heavily. And Arjuna and both the<br>twins and the illustrious Draupadi, and the mighty Bhima&#8212;he that was<br>strongest of all men&#8212;experienced the most poignant pain in casting their<br>eyes on Yudhishthira. And thinking that a short time only remained (of<br>their exile), those bulls among men, influenced by rage and hope and by<br>resorting to various exertions and endeavours, made their bodies assume<br>almost different shapes.<br><br>"After a little while, that mighty ascetic, Vyasa, the son of Satyavati,<br>came there to see the Pandavas. And seeing him approach, Kunti's son,<br>Yudhishthira, stepped forward, and duly received that high-souled one.<br>And having gratified Vyasa by bowing down unto him, Pandu's son of<br>subdued senses, after the Rishi had been seated, sat down before him,<br>desirous of listening to him. And beholding his grandsons lean and living<br>in the forest on the produce of the wilderness, that mighty sage, moved<br>by compassion, said these words, in accents choked in tears, 'O<br>mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O thou best of virtuous persons, those men<br>that do not perform ascetic austerities never attain great happiness in<br>this world. People experience happiness and misery by turns; for surely,<br>O bull among men, no man ever enjoyeth unbroken happiness. A wise man<br>endued with high wisdom, knowing that life hath its ups and downs, is<br>neither filled with joy nor with grief. When happiness cometh, one should<br>enjoy it; when misery cometh, one should bear it, as a sower of crops<br>must bide his season. Nothing is superior to asceticism: by asceticism<br>one acquireth mighty fruit. Do thou know, O Bharata, that there is<br>nothing that asceticism cannot achieve. Truth, sincerity, freedom from<br>anger, justice, self-control, restraint of the faculties, immunity from<br>malice, guilelessness, sanctity, and mortification of the senses, these,<br>O mighty monarch, purify a person of meritorious acts. Foolish persons<br>addicted to vice and bestial ways, attain to brutish births in after life<br>and never enjoy happiness. The fruit of acts done in this world is reaped<br>in the next. Therefore should one restrain his body by asceticism and the<br>observance of vows. And, O king, free from guile and with a cheerful<br>spirit, one should, according to his power, bestow gifts, after going<br>down to the recipient and paying him homage. A truth-telling person<br>attaineth a life devoid of trouble. A person void of anger attaineth<br>sincerity, and one free from malice acquireth supreme contentment. A<br>person who hath subdued his senses and his inner faculties, never knoweth<br>tribulation; nor is a person of subdued senses affected by sorrow at the<br>height of other's prosperity. A man who giveth everyone his due, and the<br>bestower of boons, attain happiness, and come by every object of<br>enjoyment; while a man free from envy reapeth perfect ease. He that<br>honoureth those to whom honour is due, attaineth birth in an illustrious<br>line; and he that hath subdued his senses, never cometh by misfortune. A<br>man whose mind followeth good, after having paid his debt to nature, is<br>on this account, born again endued with a righteous mind.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O eminently virtuous one, O mighty sage, of the<br>bestowal of gifts and the observance of asceticism, which is of greater<br>efficacy in the next world, and which, harder of practice?'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'There is nothing, O child, in this world harder to practise<br>than charity. Men greatly thirst after wealth, and wealth also is gotten<br>with difficulty. Nay, renouncing even dear life itself, heroic men, O<br>magnanimous one, enter into the depths of the sea and the forest for the<br>sake of wealth. For wealth, some betake themselves to agriculture and the<br>tending of kine, and some enter into servitude. Therefore, it is<br>extremely difficult to part with wealth that is obtained with such<br>trouble. Since nothing is harder to practise than charity, therefore, in<br>my opinion, even the bestowal of boons is superior to everything.<br>Specially is this to be borne in mind that well-earned gains should, in<br>proper time and place, be given away to pious men. But the bestowal of<br>ill-gotten gains can never rescue the giver from the evil of rebirth. It<br>hath been declared, O Yudhishthira, that by bestowing, in a pure spirit,<br>even a slight gift in due time and to a fit recipient, a man attaineth<br>inexhaustible fruit in the next world. In this connection is instanced<br>the old story regarding the fruit obtained by Mudgala, for having given<br>away only a drona[85] of corn.'"
