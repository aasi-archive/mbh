                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O adorable one, thou hast described to me in detail<br>the history of the birth of Rama and others. I wish to learn the cause of<br>their exile. Do thou, O Brahmana, relate why the sons of Dasaratha&#8212;the<br>brothers Rama and Lakshmana&#8212;went to the forest with famous princess of<br>Mithila.'<br><br>"Markandeya said, 'The pious king Dasaratha, ever mindful of the old and<br>assiduous in religious ceremonies, was greatly pleased when these sons<br>were born. And his sons gradually grew up in might and they became<br>conversant with the Vedas together with all their mysteries, and with the<br>science of arms. And when after having gone through the Brahmacharyya<br>vows the princes were married, king Dasaratha became happy and highly<br>pleased. And the intelligent Rama, the eldest of them all, became the<br>favourite of his father, and greatly pleased the people with his charming<br>ways. And then, O Bharata, the wise king, considering himself old in<br>years took counsel with his virtuous ministers and spiritual adviser for<br>installing Rama as regent of the kingdom. And all those great ministers<br>were agreed that it was time to do so. And, O scion of Kuru's race, king<br>Dasaratha was greatly pleased to behold his son,&#8212;that enhancer of<br>Kausalya's delight&#8212;possessed of eyes that were red, and arms that were<br>sinewy. And his steps were like those of a wild elephant. And he had long<br>arms and high shoulders and black and curly hair. And he was valiant, and<br>glowing with splendour, and not inferior to Indra himself in battle. And<br>he was well-versed in holy writ and was equal to Vrihaspati in wisdom. An<br>object of love with all the people, he was skilled in every science. And<br>with senses under complete control, his very enemies were pleased to<br>behold him. And he was terror of the wicked and the protector of the<br>virtuous. And possessed of intelligence and incapable of being baffled,<br>he was victorious over all and never vanquished by any. And, O descendant<br>of Kurus, beholding his son&#8212;that enhancer of Kausalya's joy&#8212;king<br>Dasaratha became highly pleased. And reflecting on Rama's virtues, the<br>powerful and mighty king cheerfully addressed the family priest, saying,<br>'Blessed be thou, O Brahmana! This night of the Pushya constellation will<br>bring in a very auspicious conjunction. Let, therefore, materials be<br>collected and let Rama also be invited. This Pushya constellation will<br>last till tomorrow. And Rama, therefore, should be invested by me and my<br>ministers as prince-regent of all my subjects!'<br><br>"Meanwhile Manthara (the maid of Kaikeyi), hearing these words of the<br>king, went to her mistress, and spoke unto her as was suited to the<br>occasion. And she said, 'Thy great ill-luck, O Kaikeyi, hath this day<br>been proclaimed by the king! O unlucky one, mayst thou be bitten by a<br>fierce and enraged snake of virulent poison! Kausalya, indeed, is<br>fortunate, as it is her son that is going to be installed on the throne.<br>Where, indeed, is thy prosperity, when thy son obtaineth not the kingdom?'<br><br>"Hearing these words of her maid, the slender-waisted and beautiful<br>Kaikeyi put on all her ornaments, and sought her husband in a secluded<br>place. And with a joyous heart, and smiling pleasantly, she addressed<br>these words to him with all the blandishments of love, 'O king, thou art<br>always true to thy promises. Thou didst promise before to grant me an<br>object of my desire. Do thou fulfil that promise now and save thyself<br>from the sin of unredeemed pledge!' The king replied, saying, 'I will<br>grant thee a boon. Ask thou whatever thou wishest! What man undeserving<br>of death shall be slain today and who that deserves death is to be set at<br>liberty? Upon whom shall I bestow wealth to-day, or whose wealth shall be<br>confiscated? Whatever wealth there is in this world, save what belongeth<br>to Brahmanas, is mine! I am the king of kings in this world, and the<br>protector of all the four classes! Tell me quickly, O blessed lady, what<br>that object is upon which thou hast set thy heart!' Hearing these words<br>of the king, and tying him fast to his pledge, and conscious also of her<br>power over him, she addressed him in these words, 'I desire that Bharata<br>be the recipient of that investiture which thou hast designed for Rama,<br>and let Rama go into exile living in the forest of Dandaka for fourteen<br>years as an ascetic with matted locks on head and robed in rags and<br>deer-skins!' Hearing these disagreeable words of cruel import, the king,<br>O chief of the Bharata race, was sorely afflicted and became utterly<br>speechless! But the mighty and virtuous Rama, learning that his father<br>had been thus solicited, went into the forest so that the king's truth<br>might remain inviolate. And, blessed be thou, he was followed by the<br>auspicious Lakshmana&#8212;that foremost of bowmen and his wife Sita, the<br>princess of Videha and daughter of Janaka. And after Rama had gone into<br>the forest, king Dasaratha took leave of his body, agreeably to the<br>eternal law of time. And knowing that Rama not near and that the king was<br>dead, queen Kaikeyi, causing Bharata to be brought before her, addressed<br>him in these words, 'Dasaratha hath gone to heaven and both Rama and<br>Lakshmana are in the forest! Take thou this kingdom which is so extensive<br>and whose peace there is no rival to disturb'. Thereupon the virtuous<br>Bharata replied unto her saying, 'Thou hast done a wicked deed, having<br>slain thy husband and exterminated this family from lust of wealth alone!<br>Heaping infamy on my head, O accursed woman of our race, thou hast, O<br>mother, attained this, thy object!' And having said these words, the<br>prince wept aloud. And having proved his innocence before all the<br>subjects of that realm he set out in the wake of Rama, desiring to bring<br>him back. And placing Kausalya and Sumitra and Kaikeyi in the vehicles at<br>the van of his train, he proceeded with a heavy heart, in company with<br>Satrughna. And he was accompanied by Vasishtha and Vamadeva, and other<br>Brahmanas by thousands and by the people of the cities and the provinces,<br>desiring to bring back Rama. And he saw Rama with Lakshmana, living on<br>the mountains of Chitrakuta with bow in hand and decked with the<br>ornaments of ascetics. Bharata, however, was dismissed by Rama, who was<br>determined to act according to the words, of his father. And returning,<br>Bharata ruled at Nandigrama, keeping before him, his brother's wooden<br>sandals. And Rama fearing a repetition of intrusion by the people of<br>Ayodhya, entered into the great forest towards the asylum of Sarabhanga.<br>And having paid his respects to Sarabhanga, he entered the forest of<br>Dandaka and took up his abode on the banks of beautiful river Godavari.<br>And while living there, Rama was inveigled into hostilities with Khara,<br>then dwelling in Janasthana, on account of Surpanakha. And for the<br>protection of the ascetics the virtuous scion of Raghu's race slew<br>fourteen thousand Rakshasas on earth, and having slain those mighty<br>Rakshasas, Khara and Dushana, the wise descendant of Raghu once more made<br>that sacred forest free from danger.'<br><br>"And after these Rakshasas had been slain, Surpanakha with mutilated nose<br>and lips, repaired to Lanka&#8212;the abode of her brother (Ravana). And when<br>that Rakshasa woman, senseless with grief and with dry blood-stains on<br>her face, appeared before Ravana, she fell down at his feet. And<br>beholding her so horribly mutilated, Ravana became senseless with wrath<br>and grinding his teeth sprung up from his seat. And dismissing his<br>ministers, he enquired of her in private, saying, 'Blessed sister, who<br>hath made thee so, forgetting and disregarding me? Who is he that having<br>got a sharp-pointed spear hath rubbed his body with it? Who is he that<br>sleepeth in happiness and security, after placing a fire close to his<br>head? Who is he that hath trodden upon a revengeful snake of virulent<br>poison? Who indeed, is that person who standeth with his hand thrust into<br>the mouth of the maned lion!' Then flames of wrath burst forth from his<br>body, like those that are emitted at night from the hollows of a tree on<br>fire. His sister then related unto him the prowess of Rama and the defeat<br>of the Rakshasas with Khara and Dushana at their head. Informed of the<br>slaughter of his relatives, Ravana, impelled by Fate, remembered Maricha<br>for slaying Rama. And resolving upon the course he was to follow and<br>having made arrangements for the government of his capital, he consoled<br>his sister, and set out on an aerial voyage. And crossing the Trikuta and<br>the Kala mountains, he beheld the vast receptacle of deep waters&#8212;the<br>abode of the Makaras. Then crossing the Ocean, the Ten headed Ravana<br>reached Gokarna&#8212;the favourite resort of the illustrious god armed with<br>the trident. And there Ravana met with his old friend Maricha who, from<br>fear of Rama himself, had adopted an ascetic mode of life.'"
