                            Vaisampayana said, "Then those Gandharvas decked in golden garlands and<br>accomplished in celestial weapons, showing their blazing shafts,<br>encountered the Pandavas from every side. And as the sons of Pandu were<br>only four in number and the Gandharvas counted by thousands, the battle<br>that ensued appeared to be extraordinary. And as the cars of Karna and<br>Duryodhana had formerly been broken into a hundred fragments by the<br>Gandharvas, so were the cars of the four heroes attempted to be broken.<br>But those tigers among men began to encounter with their showers of<br>arrows thousands upon thousands of Gandharvas rushing towards them. Those<br>rangers of skies endued with great energy, thus checked on all sides by<br>that arrowy down-pour, succeeded not in even coming near to the sons of<br>Pandu. Then Arjuna whose ire had been provoked, aiming at the angry<br>Gandharvas, prepared to hurl against them his celestial weapons. And in<br>that encounter, the mighty Arjuna, by means of his Agneya weapon, sent<br>ten hundreds of thousands of Gandharvas to the abode of Yama. And that<br>mighty bowman, Bhima, also, that foremost of all warriors in battle,<br>slew, by means of his sharp arrows, Gandharvas by hundreds. And the<br>mighty sons of Madri also, battling with vigour, encountered hundreds of<br>Gandharvas, O king, and slaughtered them all. And as Gandharvas were<br>being thus slaughtered by the mighty warriors with their celestial<br>weapons, they rose up to the skies, taking with them the sons of<br>Dhritarashtra. But Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, beholding them rise up<br>to the skies, surrounded them on every side by a wide net of arrows. And<br>confined within that arrowy net like birds within a cage, they showered<br>in wrath upon Arjuna maces and darts and broad-swords. But Arjuna who was<br>conversant with the most efficacious weapons, soon checked that shower of<br>maces and darts and broad-swords, and in return began to mangle the limbs<br>of the Gandharvas with his crescent-shaped arrows. And heads and legs and<br>arms began to drop down from above resembling a shower of stones. And at<br>that sight, the foe was struck with panic. And as the Gandharvas were<br>being slaughtered by the illustrious son of Pandu, they began to shower<br>from the skies a heavy downpour of shafts upon Arjuna, who was on the<br>surface of the earth. But that chastiser of foes, Arjuna, endued with<br>mighty energy checked that shower of arrows by means of his own weapons<br>and began, in return, to wound them. Then Arjuna of the Kuru race shot<br>his well-known weapons called Sthunakarna, Indrajala, Saura, Agneya and<br>Saumya. And the Gandharvas consumed by the fiery weapons of Kunti's son,<br>began to suffer heavily, like the sons of Diti, while being scorched by<br>Sakra's thunder-bolt. And when they attacked Arjuna from above, they were<br>checked by his net of arrows. And while they attacked him from all sides<br>on the surface of the earth, they were checked by his crescent-shaped<br>arrows. And beholding the Gandharvas put in fear by Kunti's son,<br>Chitrasena rushed, O Bharata, at Dhananjaya, armed with a mace. And as<br>the king of the Gandharvas was rushing at Arjuna from above with that<br>mace in hand, the latter cut with his arrows that mace wholly made of<br>iron into seven pieces. And beholding that mace of his cut into many<br>pieces by Arjuna of great activity, with his arrows, Chitrasena, by means<br>of his science, concealed himself from the view of the Pandava and began<br>to fight with him. The heroic Arjuna, however, by means of his own<br>celestial weapons checked all the celestial weapons that were aimed at<br>him by the Gandharvas. And when the chief of the Gandharvas saw that he<br>was checked by the illustrious Arjuna with those weapons of his he<br>entirely disappeared from sight by help of his powers of illusion. And<br>Arjuna, observing that the chief of the Gandharvas was striking at him<br>concealed from sight, attacked his assailant with celestial weapon<br>inspired with proper Mantras. And the multiform Dhananjaya filled with<br>wrath, prevented the disappearance of his foe by means of his weapon<br>known by the name of Sabda-veda. And assailed with those weapons by the<br>illustrious Arjuna, his dear friend, the king of the Gandharvas, showed<br>himself unto him. And Chitrasena said, 'Behold in me thy friend battling<br>with thee!' And beholding his friend Chitrasena exhausted in the battle,<br>that bull among the sons of Pandu withdrew the weapons he had shot. And<br>the other sons of Pandu beholding Arjuna withdraw his weapons, checked<br>their flying steeds and the impetus of their weapons and withdrew their<br>bows. And Chitrasena and Bhima and Arjuna and the twins enquiring about<br>one another's welfare, sat awhile on their respective cars."
