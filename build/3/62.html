                            "Nala said, 'Surely, thy father's kingdom is as my own. But thither I<br>will not, by any means, repair in this extremity. Once I appeared there<br>in glory, increasing thy joy. How can I go there now in misery,<br>augmenting thy grief?'<br><br>"Vrihadaswa continued, 'Saying this again and again unto Damayanti, king<br>Nala, wrapped in half a garment, comforted his blessed wife. And both<br>attired in one cloth and wearied with hunger and thirst, in course of<br>their wanderings, at last they came to a sheltered shed for travellers.<br>And arrived at this place, the king of the Nishadhas sat down on the bare<br>earth with the princes of Vidarbha. And wearing the same piece of cloth<br>(with Damayanti), and dirty, and haggard, and stained with dust, he fell<br>asleep with Damayanti on the ground in weariness. And suddenly plunged in<br>distress, the innocent and delicate Damayanti with every mark of good<br>fortune, fell into a profound slumber. And, O monarch, while she slept,<br>Nala, with heart and mind distraught, could not slumber calmly as before.<br>And reflecting on the loss of his kingdom, the desertion of his friends,<br>and his distress in the woods, he thought with himself, 'What availeth my<br>acting thus? And what if I act not thus? Is death the better for me now?<br>Or should I desert my wife? She is truly devoted to me and suffereth this<br>distress for my sake. Separated from me, she may perchance wander to her<br>relatives. Devoted as she is to me, if she stayeth with me, distress will<br>surely be hers; while it is doubtful, if I desert her. On the other hand,<br>it is not unlikely that she may even have happiness some time.'<br>Reflecting upon this repeatedly, and thinking of it again and again, he<br>concluded, O monarch, that the desertion of Damayanti was the best course<br>for him. And he also thought, 'Of high fame and auspicious fortune, and<br>devoted to me, her husband, she is incapable of being injured by any one<br>on the way on account of her energy.' Thus his mind that was influenced<br>by the wicked Kali, dwelling upon Damayanti, was made up for deserting<br>her. And then thinking of his own want of clothing, and of her being clad<br>in a single garment, he intended to cut off for himself one half of<br>Damayanti's attire. And he thought, 'How shall I divide this garment, so<br>that my beloved one may not perceive?' And thinking of this, the royal<br>Nala began to walk up and down that shed. And, O Bharata, pacing thus to<br>and fro, he found a handsome sword lying near the shed, unsheathed. And<br>that repressor of foes, having, with that sword cut off one half of the<br>cloth, and throwing the instrument away, left the daughter of Vidharbha<br>insensible in her sleep and went away. But his heart failing him, the<br>king of the Nishadhas returned to the shed, and seeing Damayanti (again),<br>burst into tears. And he said, 'Alas! that beloved one of mine whom<br>neither the god of wind nor the sun had seen before, even she sleepeth<br>to-day on the bare earth, like one forlorn. Clad in this severed piece of<br>cloth, and lying like one distracted, how will the beauteous one of<br>luminous smiles behave when she awaketh? How will the beautiful daughter<br>of Bhima, devoted to her lord, all alone and separated from me, wander<br>through these deep woods inhabited by beasts and serpents? O blessed one,<br>may the Adityas and the Vasus, and the twin Aswins together with the<br>Marutas protect thee, thy virtue being thy best guard.' And addressing<br>thus his dear wife peerless on earth in beauty, Nala strove to go, reft<br>of reason by Kali. Departing and still departing, king Nala returned<br>again and again to that shed, dragged away by Kali but drawn back by<br>love. And it seemed as though the heart of the wretched king was rent in<br>twain, and like a swing, he kept going out from cabin and coming back<br>into it. At length after lamenting long and piteously, Nala stupefied and<br>bereft of sense by Kali went away, forsaking that sleeping wife of his.<br>Reft of reason through Kali's touch, and thinking of his conduct, the<br>king departed in sorrow, leaving his, wife alone in that solitary<br>forest.'"
