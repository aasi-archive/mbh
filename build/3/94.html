                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O best of celestial Rishis, I do not think that I am<br>without merits. Yet am I afflicted with so much sorrow that there never<br>was a king like me. I think, however, that my enemies are destitute of<br>good qualities and even destitute of morality. Yet why, O Lomasa, do they<br>prosper in this world?"<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'Grieve not ever, O king, O son of Pritha, that sinful men<br>should often prosper in consequence of the sins they commit. A man may be<br>seen to prosper by his sins, obtain good therefrom and vanquish his foes.<br>Destruction, however, overtakes him to the roots. O king, I have seen<br>many Daityas and Danavas prosper by sin but I have also seen destruction<br>overtake them. O exalted one, I have seen all this in the righteous age<br>of yore. The gods practised virtue, while the Asuras abandoned it. The<br>gods visited the tirthas, while the Asuras did not visit them. And at<br>first the sinful Asuras were possessed with pride. And pride begat vanity<br>and vanity begat wrath. And from wrath arose every kind of evil<br>propensities, and from these latter sprang shamelessness. And in<br>consequence of shamelessness, good behaviour disappeared from among them.<br>And because they had become shameless and destitute of virtuous<br>propensities and good conduct and virtuous vows, forgiveness and<br>prosperity and morality forsook them in no time. And prosperity then, O<br>king, sought the gods, while adversity sought the Asuras. And when the<br>Daityas and the Danavas, deprived of sense by pride, were possessed by<br>adversity. Kali also sought to possess them. And, O son of Kunti,<br>overwhelmed with pride, and destitute of rites and sacrifices, and devoid<br>of reason and feeling, and their hearts full of vanity, destruction<br>overtook them soon. And covered with infamy, the Daityas were soon<br>exterminated. The gods, however, who were virtuous in their practices,<br>going to the seas, the rivers, the lakes and the holy spots, cleansed<br>themselves of all sins, O son of Pandu, by means of ascetic penances and<br>sacrifices and gifts and blessings, and obtained prosperity and the<br>consequence. And because the gods always performed sacrifices and holy<br>deeds abandoning every practice that was evil, and visited the tirthas,<br>as the consequence thereof they acquired great good fortune. Guided by<br>this, O king, do thou also, with thy brothers, bathe in tirthas, for then<br>thou wilt obtain prosperity once more. Even this is the eternal road.<br>And, O monarch, as king Nriga and Shivi and Ausinara and Bhagiratha and<br>Vasumanas and Gaya and Puru and Pururavas, by practising ascetic penances<br>and visiting tirthas and touching sacred waters and beholding illustrious<br>ascetics, obtained fame and sanctity and merit and wealth, so wilt thou<br>also obtain prosperity that is great. And as Ikshwaku with his sons,<br>friends and followers, as Muchukunda and Mandhatri and king Marutta, as<br>the gods through power of asceticism and the celestial Rishis also, had<br>all obtained fame, so wilt thou also obtain great celebrity. The sons of<br>Dhritarashtra, on the other hand, enslaved by sinfulness and ignorance,<br>will, without doubt, be soon exterminated like the Daityas.'"
