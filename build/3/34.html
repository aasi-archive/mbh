                            Vaisampayana said, "Thus addressed by Bhimasena, the high-souled king<br>Ajatasatru firmly devoted to truth, mustering his patience, after a few<br>moments said these words, 'No doubt, O Bharata, all this is true. I<br>cannot reproach thee for thy torturing me thus by piercing me with thy<br>arrowy words. From my folly alone hath this calamity come against you. I<br>sought to cast the dice desiring to snatch from Dhritarashtra's son his<br>kingdom with the sovereignty. It was therefore that, that cunning<br>gambler&#8212;Suvala's son&#8212;played against me on behalf of Suyodhana. Sakuni,<br>a native of the hilly country, is exceedingly artful. Casting the dice in<br>the presence of the assembly, unacquainted as I am with artifices of any<br>kind, he vanquished me artfully. It is, therefore, O Bhimasena, that we<br>have been overwhelmed with this calamity. Beholding the dice favourable<br>to the wishes of Sakuni in odds and evens, I could have controlled my<br>mind. Anger, however, driveth off a person's patience. O child, the mind<br>cannot be kept under control when it is influenced by hauteur, vanity, or<br>pride. I do not reproach thee, O Bhimasena, for the words thou usest. I<br>only regard that what hath befallen us was pre-ordained. When king<br>Duryodhana, the son of Dhritarashtra, coveting our kingdom, plunged us<br>into misery and even slavery, then, O Bhima, it was Draupadi that rescued<br>us. When summoned again to the assembly for playing once more, thou<br>knowest as well as Arjuna what Dhritarashtra's son told me, in the<br>presence of all the Bharatas, regarding the stake for which we were to<br>play. His words were, O prince Ajatsatru, (if vanquished), thou shalt<br>have with all thy brothers, to dwell, to the knowledge of all men, for<br>twelve years in the forest of thy choice, passing the thirteenth year in<br>secrecy. If during the latter period, the spies of the Bharatas, hearing<br>of thee, succeed in discovering thee, thou shalt have again to live in<br>the forest for the same period, passing once more the last year in<br>secrecy. Reflecting upon this, pledge thyself to it. As regards myself, I<br>promise truly in this assembly of the Kurus, that if thou canst pass this<br>time confounding my spies and undiscovered by them, then, O Bharata, this<br>kingdom of the five rivers is once more thine. We also, O Bharata, if<br>vanquished by thee, shall, all of us, abandoning all our wealth, pass the<br>same period, according to the same rules. Thus addressed by the prince, I<br>replied unto him in the midst of all the Kurus, 'So be it!' The wretched<br>game then commenced. We were vanquished and have been exiled. It is for<br>this that we are wandering miserably over different woody regions<br>abounding with discomfort. Suyodhana, however, still dissatisfied, gave<br>himself up to anger, and urged the Kurus as also all those under his sway<br>to express their joy at our calamity. Having entered into such an<br>agreement in the presence of all good men, who dareth break it for the<br>sake of a kingdom on earth? For a respectable person, I think, even death<br>itself is lighter than the acquisition of sovereignty by an act of<br>transgression. At the time of the play, thou hadst desired to burn my<br>hands. Thou wert prevented by Arjuna, and accordingly didst only squeeze<br>thy own hands. If thou couldst do what thou hadst desired, could this<br>calamity befall us? Conscious of thy prowess, why didst thou not, O<br>Bhima, say so before we entered into such an agreement? Overwhelmed with<br>the consequence of our pledge, and the time itself having passed, what is<br>the use of thy addressing me these harsh words? O Bhima, this is my great<br>grief that we could not do anything even beholding Draupadi persecuted in<br>that way. My heart burneth as if I have drunk some poisonous liquid.<br>Having, however, given that pledge in the midst of the Kuru heroes, I am<br>unable to violate it now. Wait, O Bhima, for the return of our better<br>days, like the scatterer of seeds waiting for the harvest. When one that<br>hath been first injured, succeedeth in revenging himself upon his foe at<br>a time when the latter's enmity hath borne fruit and flowers, he is<br>regarded to have accomplished a great thing by his prowess. Such a brave<br>person earneth undying fame. Such a man obtaineth great prosperity. His<br>enemies bow down unto him, and his friends gather round him, like the<br>celestials clustering round Indra for protection. But know, O Bhima, my<br>promise can never be untrue. I regard virtue as superior to life itself<br>and a blessed state of celestial existence. Kingdom, sons, fame,<br>wealth,&#8212;all these do not come up to even a sixteenth part of truth.'
