                            (Aranya Parva)<br><br>Janamejaya said, "Having felt great affliction on account of the<br>abduction of their wife and having rescued Krishna thereafter, what did<br>the Pandavas next do?"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Having felt great affliction on account of the<br>abduction of Krishna, king Yudhishthira of unfading glory, with his<br>brothers, left the woods of Kamyaka and returned to the delightful and<br>picturesque Dwaitavana abounding in trees and containing delicious fruits<br>and roots. And the sons of Pandu with their wife Krishna began to reside<br>there, living frugally on fruits and practising rigid vows. And while<br>those repressers of foes, the virtuous king Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Kunti, and Bhimasena, and Arjuna, and those other sons of Pandu born of<br>Madri, were dwelling in Dwaitavana, practising rigid vows, they<br>underwent, for the sake of a Brahmana, great trouble, which, however, was<br>destined to bring about their future happiness. I will tell thee all<br>about the trouble which those foremost of Kurus underwent while living in<br>those woods, and which in the end brought about their happiness. Do thou<br>listen to it! Once on a time, as a deer was butting about, it chanced<br>that the two sticks for making fire and a churning staff belonging to a<br>Brahmana devoted to ascetic austerities, struck fast into its antlers.<br>And, thereupon, O king, that powerful deer of exceeding fleetness with<br>long bounds, speedily went out of the hermitage, taking those articles<br>away. And, O foremost of Kurus, seeing those articles of his thus carried<br>away, the Brahmana, anxious on account of his Agnihotra, quickly came<br>before the Pandavas. And approaching without loss of time Ajatasatru<br>seated in that forest with his brothers, the Brahmana, in great distress,<br>spake these words, 'As a deer was butting about, it happened, O king,<br>that my fire-sticks and churning staff which had been placed against a<br>large tree stuck fast to its antlers. O king, that powerful deer of<br>exceeding fleetness hath speedily gone out of the hermitage with long<br>bounds, taking those articles away. Tracking that powerful deer, O king,<br>by its foot-prints, do ye, ye sons of Pandu, bring back those articles of<br>mine, so that my Agnihotra may not be stopped!' Hearing these words of<br>the Brahmana, Yudhishthira became exceedingly concerned. And the son of<br>Kunti taking up his bow sallied out with his brothers. And putting on<br>their corselets and equipped with their bows, those bulls among men,<br>intent upon serving the Brahmana, swiftly sallied out in the wake of the<br>deer. And descrying the deer at no great distance, those mighty warriors<br>discharged at it barbed arrows and javelins and darts, but the sons of<br>Pandu could not pierce it by any means. And as they struggled to pursue<br>and slay it, that powerful deer became suddenly invisible. And losing<br>sight of the deer, the noble-minded sons of Pandu, fatigued and<br>disappointed and afflicted with hunger and thirst, approached a banian<br>tree in that deep forest, and sat down in its cool shade. And when they<br>had sat down, Nakula stricken with sorrow and urged by impatience,<br>addressed his eldest brother of the Kuru race, saying, 'In our race, O<br>king, virtue hath never been sacrificed, nor hath there been loss of<br>wealth from insolence. And being asked, we have never said to any<br>creature, Nay! Why then in the present case have we met with this<br>disaster?"
