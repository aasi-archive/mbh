                            Markandeya said, "The Muni named Visrava, who was begotten of half the<br>soul of Pulastya, in a fit of passion, began to look upon Vaisravana with<br>great anger. But, O monarch, Kuvera, the king of the Rakshasas, knowing<br>that his father was angry with him, always sought to please him. And, O<br>best of Bharata's race, that king of kings living in Lanka, and borne<br>upon the shoulders of men, sent three Rakshasa women to wait upon his<br>father. Their names, O king, were Pushpotkata, Raka and Malini. And they<br>were skilled in singing and dancing and were always assiduous in their<br>attentions on that high-souled Rishi. And those slender-waisted ladies<br>vied with one another, O king, in gratifying the Rishi. And that<br>high-souled and adorable being was pleased with them and granted them<br>boons. And to every one of them he gave princely sons according to their<br>desire. Two sons&#8212;those foremost of Rakshasas named Kumvakarna and the<br>Ten-headed Ravana,&#8212;both unequalled on earth in prowess, were born to<br>Pushpotkata. And Malini had a son named Vibhishana, and Raka had twin<br>children named Khara and Surpanakha. And Vibhishana surpassed them all in<br>beauty. And that excellent person was very pious and assiduously<br>performed all religious rites. But that foremost of Rakshasas, with ten<br>heads, was the eldest to them all. And he was religious, and energetic<br>and possessed of great strength and prowess. And the Rakshasa Kumvakarna<br>was the most powerful in battle, for he was fierce and terrible and a<br>thorough master of the arts of illusion. And Khara was proficient in<br>archery, and hostile to the Brahmanas, subsisting as he did on flesh. And<br>the fierce Surpanakha was constant source of trouble to the ascetics. And<br>the warriors, learned in the Vedas and diligent in ceremonial rites, all<br>lived with their father in the Gandhamadana. And there they beheld<br>Vaisravana seated with their father, possessed of riches and borne on the<br>shoulders of men. And seized with jealousy, they resolved upon performing<br>penances. And with ascetic penances of the most severe kind, they<br>gratified Brahma. And the Ten-headed Ravana, supporting life by means of<br>air alone and surrounded by the five sacred fires and absorbed in<br>meditation, remained standing on one leg for a thousand years. And<br>Kumvakarna with head downwards, and with restricted diet, was constant in<br>austerities. And the wise and magnanimous Vibhishana, observing fasts and<br>subsisting only on dry leaves and engaged in meditation, practised severe<br>austerities for a long period. And Khara and Surpanakha, with cheerful<br>hearts, protected and attended on them while they were performing those<br>austerities. And at the close of a thousand years, the invincible<br>Ten-headed One, cutting off his own heads, offered them as offering to<br>the sacred fire. And at this act of his, the Lord of the Universe was<br>pleased with him. And then Brahma, personally appearing to them, bade<br>them desist from those austerities and promised to grant boons unto every<br>one of them. And the adorable Brahma said, I am pleased with you, my<br>sons! Cease now from these austerities and ask boons of me! Whatever your<br>desires may be, they, with the single exception of that of immortality,<br>will be fulfilled! As thou hast offered thy heads to the fire from great<br>ambition, they will again adorn thy body as before, according to thy<br>desire. And thy body will not be disfigured and thou shall be able to<br>assume any form according to thy desire and become the conqueror of thy<br>foes in battle. There is no doubt of this!' thereupon Ravana said, 'May I<br>never experience defeat at the hands of Gandharvas, Celestials, Kinnaras,<br>Asuras, Yakshas, Rakshasas, Serpents and all other creatures!' Brahma<br>said, 'From those that hast named, thou shalt never have cause of fear;<br>except from men (thou shalt have no occasion for fear). Good betide thee!<br>So hath it been ordained by me!'<br><br>"Markandeya said, 'Thus addressed, the Ten-headed (Ravana) was highly<br>gratified, for on account of his perverted understanding, the man-eating<br>one slightened human beings. Then the great Grandsire addressed<br>Kumbhakarna as before. His reason being clouded by darkness, he asked for<br>long-lasting sleep. Saying, 'It shall be so' 'Brahma then addressed<br>Vibhishana, 'O my son, I am much pleased with thee! Ask any boon thou<br>pleasest!' Thereupon, Vibhishana replied, 'Even in great danger, may I<br>never swerve from the path of righteousness, and though ignorant, may I,<br>O adorable Sire, be illumined with the light of divine knowledge!' And<br>Brahma replied, 'O scourge of thy enemies, as thy soul inclines not to<br>unrighteousness although born in the Rakshasa race, I grant thee<br>immortality!'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Having obtained this boon, the Ten-headed<br>Rakshasa defeated Kuvera in battle and obtained from him the sovereignty<br>of Lanka. That adorable Being, leaving Lanka and followed by Gandharvas,<br>Yakshas, Rakshas, and Kinnaras, went to live on mount Gandhamadana. And<br>Ravana forcibly took from him the celestial chariot Pushpaka. And upon<br>this Vaisravana cursed him, saying, 'This chariot shall never carry thee;<br>it shall bear him who will slay thee in battle! And as thou hast insulted<br>me, thy elder brother, thou shalt soon die!'<br><br>"The pious Vibhishana, O King, treading in the path followed by the<br>virtuous and possessed of great glory, followed Kuvera. That adorable<br>Lord of wealth, highly pleased with his younger brothers, invested him<br>with the command of the Yaksha and Raksha hosts. On the other hand, the<br>powerful and man-eating Rakshasas and Pisachas, having assembled<br>together, invested the Ten-headed Ravana with their sovereignty. And<br>Ravana, capable of assuming any form at will and terrible in prowess, and<br>capable also of passing through the air, attacked the gods and the<br>Daityas and wrested from them all their valuable possessions. And as he<br>had terrified all creatures, he was called Ravana. And Ravana, capable of<br>mustering any measure of might inspired the very gods with terror."
