                            "Dhaumya continued, 'Listen, O Bharata, I shall now narrate to thee in<br>detail according to my knowledge, the sacred tirthas of the south. In<br>that quarter lieth the sacred and auspicious river Godavari, full of<br>water abounding in groves and frequented by ascetics. In that direction<br>also are the rivers Venna and Bhimarathi, both capable of destroying sin<br>and fear, and abounding in birds and deer, and graced with abodes of<br>ascetics. In that region also, O bull of the Bharata race, is the tirtha<br>of the royal ascetic, Nriga viz., the river Payoshni, which is delightful<br>and full of waters and visited by Brahmanas. There the illustrious<br>Markandeya, of high ascetic merit sang the praises in verse of king<br>Nriga's line! We have heard respecting the sacrificing king Nriga that<br>which really took place while he was performing a sacrifice in the<br>excellent tirtha called Varaha on the Payoshni. In that sacrifice Indra<br>became intoxicated with quaffing the Soma, and the Brahmanas, with the<br>gifts they received. The water of the Payoshni, taken up (in vessel), or<br>flowing along the ground, or conveyed by the wind, can cleanse a person<br>from whatever sins he may commit till the day of his death. Higher than<br>heaven itself, and pure, and created and bestowed by the trident-bearing<br>god, there in that tirtha is an image of Mahadeva beholding which a<br>mortal goeth to the region of Siva. Placing on one scale Ganga and the<br>other rivers with their waters, and on the other, the Payoshni, the<br>latter, in my opinion would be superior to all the tirthas, together, in<br>point of merit! Then, O foremost of the Bharata race, on the mountain<br>called Varunasrotasa is the sacred and auspicious wood of Mathara<br>abounding in fruits and roots, and containing a sacrificial stake. Then,<br>O king, it is said that in the region on the north of the Praveni, and<br>about the sacred asylum of Kanwa, are many woody retreats of ascetics.<br>And, O child, in the tirtha called Surparaka are two sacrificial<br>platforms of the illustrious Jamadagni, called Pashana and Punaschandra,<br>O Bharata! And, O son of Kunti, in that spot is the tirtha called Asoka<br>abounding in woody retreats of ascetics. And, O Yudhishthira, in the<br>country of the Pandyas are the tirthas named Agastya and Varuna! And, O<br>bull among men, there, amongst the Pandavas, is the tirtha called the<br>Kumaris. Listen, O son of Kunti, I shall now describe Tamraparni. In that<br>asylum the gods had undergone penances impelled by the desire of<br>obtaining salvation. In that region also is the lake of Gokarna which is<br>celebrated over the three worlds, hath an abundance of cool waters, and<br>is sacred, auspicious, and capable, O child, of producing great merit.<br>That lake is extremely difficult of access to men of unpurified souls.<br>Near to that tirtha is the sacred asylum of Agastya's disciple, the<br>mountain Devasabha, which abounds in trees and grass, and fruits and<br>roots. And there also is the Vaiduryya mountain, which is delightful<br>abounding in gems and capable of bestowing great merit. There on that<br>mountain is the asylum of Agastya abounding in fruits and roots and<br>water.'"<br><br>"I shall now, O lord of men, describe the sacred spots, and asylums, and<br>rivers and lakes belonging to the Surashtra country! O Yudhishthira, the<br>Brahmanas say that on the sea-coast is the Chamasodbheda, and also<br>Prabhasa, that tirtha which is much regarded by the gods. There also is<br>the tirtha called Pindaraka, frequented by ascetics and capable of<br>producing great merit. In that region is a mighty hill named Ujjayanta<br>which conduceth to speedy success. Regarding it the celestial Rishi<br>Narada of great intelligence hath recited an ancient sloka. Do thou<br>listen to it, O Yudhishthira! By performing austerities on the sacred<br>hill of Ujjayanta in Surashtra, that abounds in birds and animals, a<br>person becometh regarded in heaven. There also is Dwaravati, producing<br>great merit, where dwelleth the slayer of Madhu, who is the Ancient one<br>in embodied form, and eternal virtue. Brahmanas versed in the Vedas, and<br>persons acquainted with the philosophy of the soul say that the<br>illustrious Krishna is eternal Virtue. Govinda is said to be the purest<br>of all pure things, the righteous of the righteous and the auspicious of<br>the auspicious. In all the three worlds, He of eyes like lotus-leaves is<br>the God of gods, and is eternal. He is the pure soul and the active<br>principle of life, is the Supreme Brahma and is the lord of all. That<br>slayer of Madhu, Hari of inconceivable soul, dwelleth there!"
