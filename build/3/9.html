                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'O holy one, I did not like this business of<br>gambling, but, O Muni, I think, I was made to consent to it drawn by<br>fate! Neither Bhishma, nor Drona, nor Vidura, nor Gandhari liked this<br>game at dice. No doubt, it was begot of folly. And, O thou who delightest<br>in the observance of vows, O illustrious one, knowing everything yet<br>influenced by paternal affection, I am unable to cast off my senseless<br>son, Duryodhana!'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'O king, O son of Vichitravirya, what thou sayest is true!<br>We know it well that a son is the best of all things and that there is<br>nothing that is so good as a son. Instructed by the tears of Suravi,<br>Indra came to know that the son surpasseth in worth other valuable<br>possessions. O monarch, I will, in this connection, relate to thee that<br>excellent and best of stories, the conversation between Indra and Suravi.<br>In days of yore, Suravi, the mother of cows was once weeping in the<br>celestial regions. O child, Indra took compassion upon her, and asked<br>her, saying, 'O auspicious one! why dost thou weep? Is everything well<br>with the celestials? Hath any misfortune, ever so little, befallen the<br>world of men or serpents?' Suravi replied, 'No evil hath befallen thee<br>that I perceive. But I am aggrieved on account of my son, and it is<br>therefore, O Kausika, that I weep! See, O chief of the celestials, yonder<br>cruel husbandman is belabouring my weak son with the wooden stick, and<br>oppressing him with the (weight of the) plough, in consequence of which<br>my child agitated with agony is falling upon the ground and is at the<br>point of death. At sight of this, O lord of the celestials, I am filled<br>with compassion, and my mind is agitated! The one that is the stronger of<br>the pair is bearing his burthen of greater weight (with ease), but, O<br>Vasava, the other is lean, and weak and is a mass of veins and arteries!<br>He beareth his burthen with difficulty! And it is for him that I grieve.<br>See, O Vasava, sore inflicted with the whip, and harassed exceedingly, he<br>is unable to bear his burthen. And it is for him that, moved by grief, I<br>weep in heaviness of heart and these tears of compassion trickle down my<br>eyes!'<br><br>"Sakra said, 'O fair one, when thousands of thy son are (daily)<br>oppressed, why dost thou grieve for one under infliction?' Suravi<br>replied. 'Although I have a thousand offspring, yet my affections flow<br>equally towards all! But, O Sakra, I feel greater compassion for one that<br>is weak and innocent!'<br><br>"Vyasa continued, 'Then Indra having heard these words of Suravi, was<br>much surprised, and O thou of the Kuru race, he became convinced that a<br>son is dearer than one's life! And the illustrious chastiser of Paka<br>thereupon suddenly poured there a thick shower and caused obstruction to<br>the husbandman's work. And as Suravi said, thy affections, O king,<br>equally flow towards all thy sons. Let them be greater towards those that<br>are weak! And as my son Pandu is to me, so art thou, O son, and so also<br>Vidura of profound wisdom! It is out of affection that I tell you all<br>this! O Bharata, thou art possessed of a hundred and one sons, but Pandu<br>hath only five. And they are in a bad plight and passing their days in<br>sorrow. How may they save their lives, how may they thrive such thoughts<br>regarding the distressed sons of Pritha continually agitate my soul! O<br>king of the earth, if thou desirest all the Kauravas to live, let thy son<br>Duryodhana make peace with the Pandavas!'"
