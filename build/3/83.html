                            "Pulastya said, 'One should next proceed, O king, to the adored<br>Kurukshetra at sight of which all creatures are freed from their sins. He<br>is freed from all sins who constantly sayeth, 'I will live in<br>Kurukshetra.' The very dust of Kurukshetra, conveyed by the wind, leadeth<br>a sinful man to a blessed course (in after-life). They that dwell in<br>Kurukshetra which lieth to the south of the Saraswati and the north of<br>the Drishadwati, are said to dwell in heaven. O hero, one should reside<br>there, O thou foremost of warriors, for a month. There, O lord of earth,<br>the gods with Brahma at their head, the Rishis, the Siddhas, the<br>Charanas, the Gandharvas, the Apsaras, the Yakshas and the Nagas, often<br>repair, O Bharata, to the highly sacred Brahmakshetra. O foremost of<br>warriors, the sins of one that desireth to repair to Kurukshetra even<br>mentally are all destroyed, and he finally goeth into the region of<br>Brahma. O son of the Kuru race, by repairing to Kurukshetra in a pious<br>frame of mind, one obtaineth the fruit of the Rajasuya and horse<br>sacrifices. By saluting next the Yaksha called Mankanaka, that mighty<br>gate-keeper (of Kuvera), cue obtaineth the fruit of giving away a<br>thousand kine. O virtuous king, one should next repair to the excellent<br>region of Vishnu, where Hari is always present. Bathing there and bowing<br>down unto Hari, the Creator of the three worlds, one obtaineth the fruit<br>of the horse-sacrifice and repaireth to the abode of Vishnu. One should<br>next repair to Pariplava, that tirtha celebrated over the three worlds,<br>and (bathing there), O Bharata, one obtaineth merit that is greater than<br>that of the Agnishtoma and the Atiratra sacrifices. Repairing next to the<br>tirtha called Prithivi, one obtaineth the fruit of the gift of a thousand<br>kine. The pilgrim should next, O king, proceed to Shalukini and bathing<br>there in the Dasaswamedha one obtaineth the merit of ten<br>horse-sacrifices. Proceeding next to Sarpadevi, that excellent tirtha of<br>the Nagas, one obtaineth the merit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice and<br>attaineth to the region of the Nagas. O virtuous one, one should next<br>proceed to Tarantuka, the gatekeeper, and residing there for one night<br>one obtaineth the merit of giving away a thousand kine. Proceeding next<br>with subdued senses and regulated diet to Panchananda and bathing in the<br>tirtha there, called Koti, one obtaineth the fruit of the<br>horse-sacrifice. Proceeding then to the tirtha of the twin Aswins one<br>obtaineth personal beauty. O virtuous one, one should next proceed to the<br>excellent tirtha called Varaha, where Vishnu formerly stood in the form<br>of a boar. Bathing there one obtaineth, O foremost of men, the merit of<br>the horse-sacrifice. One should next, O king, repair to the tirtha called<br>Sama in Jayanti. Bathing there one obtaineth the merit of Rajasuya<br>sacrifice. By bathing in Ekahansa, a man obtaineth the merit of giving<br>away a thousand kine. O king, a pilgrim repairing to Kritasaucha<br>obtaineth the lotus-eyed deity (Vishnu) and perfect purity of soul. One<br>should next proceed to Munjavata, that spot sacred to the illustrious<br>Sthanu. Residing there without food for one night, one obtaineth the<br>status called Ganapatya. There, O king, is the celebrated tirtha called<br>Yakshini. O king, repairing to that tirtha and bathing there, one<br>obtaineth fruition of all his desires. O bull of the Bharata race, that<br>tirtha is regarded as the gate of Kurukshetra. The pilgrim should with<br>concentrated soul, walk round it. Equal unto the Pushkaras, it was<br>created by the high-souled Rama, the son of Jamadagni. Bathing there and<br>worshipping the Pitris and the gods, one obtaineth, O king, the merit of<br>the horse-sacrifice and becometh successful in everything. The pilgrim<br>should next repair with concentrated soul to the Rama-hrada. There, O<br>king, the heroic Rama of resplendent energy, exterminating the Kshatriyas<br>by his might, dug five lakes and filled them, O tiger among men, with the<br>blood of his victims, as heard by us. And having filled those lakes with<br>Kshatriya blood, Rama offered oblations of blood to his sires and<br>grandsires. Gratified (with the oblations) those Rishis then addressed<br>Rama and said, 'O Rama, O Rama, O thou of great good fortune, we have<br>been gratified with thee, O thou of the Bhrigu race, for this thy regard<br>for the Pitris, and thy prowess, O exalted one! Blessed be thou and ask<br>thou the boon thou choosest. What is that thou desirest, O thou of great<br>splendour!' Thus addressed (by them), Rama, that foremost of smiters,<br>said with joined hands these words unto the Pitris, stationed in the<br>firmament, 'If ye have been gratified with me, if I have deserved your<br>favour, I desire this favour of the Pitris, viz., that I may have<br>pleasure again in ascetic austerities. Let me also, through your power,<br>be freed from the sin I have committed by exterminating, from wrath, the<br>Kshatriya race. Let also my lakes become tirthas celebrated over the<br>world. The Pitris, hearing these blessed words of Rama, were highly<br>gratified, and filled with joy they answered him saying, 'Let thy<br>asceticism increase in consequence of thy regard for the Pitris. Thou<br>hast exterminated the Kshatriyas from wrath. Freed art thou already from<br>that sin, for they have perished as a consequence of their own misdeeds.<br>Without doubt, these lakes of thine will become tirthas. And if one,<br>bathing in these lakes, offereth oblations of the water thereof to the<br>Pitris, the latter gratified with him will grant him desire, difficult of<br>fulfilment in the world as also eternal heaven.' O king, having granted<br>him these boons, the Pitris joyfully saluted Rama of the Bhrigu race and<br>disappeared there and then. It was thus that the lakes of the illustrious<br>Rama of the Bhrigu race became sacred. Leading a Brahmacharya mode of<br>life and observing sacred vows, one should bathe in the lakes of Rama.<br>Bathing therein and worshipping Rama, one obtaineth, O king, the merit of<br>gift of gold in abundance. Proceeding next, O son of the Kuru race, to<br>Vansamulaka, a pilgrim by bathing there, raiseth, O king, his own race. O<br>best of the Bharatas, arriving next at the tirtha called Kayasodhana, and<br>bathing there, one purifieth, without doubt, his body, and proceeded with<br>purified body to the blessed region of unrivalled excellence. One should<br>next repair, O virtuous one, to that tirtha, celebrated over the three<br>worlds, called Lokoddara, where formerly Vishnu of great prowess had<br>created the worlds. Arriving at that tirtha which is adored by the three<br>worlds one earneth, O king, by bathing there, numerous worlds for<br>himself. Repairing next with subdued soul to the tirtha called Sree, one<br>acquires, by bathing there and worshipping the Pitris and the gods, high<br>prosperity. Leading a Brahmacharya mode of life and with concentrated<br>soul, one should proceed next to the tirtha called Kapila. Bathing there<br>and worshipping one's own Pitris and the gods, a man earneth the fruit of<br>the gift of a thousand Kapila kine. Repairing next to the tirtha called<br>Surya and bathing there with subdued soul and worshipping the Pitris and<br>the gods, fasting all the while, one obtaineth the fruit of the<br>Agnishtoma sacrifice and goeth (finally) to the region of the Sun. The<br>pilgrim by proceeding next to Gobhavana and bathing there obtaineth the<br>merit of the gift of a thousand kine. O son of the Kuru race, a pilgrim<br>by repairing then to the tirtha called Shankhini and bathing in the<br>Devi-tirtha that is there, obtaineth high prowess. O king, one should<br>then proceed to the tirtha called Tarandaka situated in the Saraswati and<br>belonging to the illustrious chief of the Yakshas who is one of the<br>gate-keepers (of Kuvera). O king, bathing there one obtaineth the fruit<br>of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. O virtuous king, one should next repair to<br>the tirtha called Brahmavarta. Bathing in Brahmavarta, one ascendeth to<br>the abode of Brahma. O king, one should then repair to the excellent<br>tirtha called Sutirtha. There the Pitris are ever present along with the<br>gods. One should bathe there and worship the Pitris and the gods. By so<br>doing, one obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice and goeth (finally)<br>into the region of the Pitris. It is for this, O virtuous one, that<br>Sutirtha situate in Amvumati is regarded as so excellent. And, O thou<br>best of the Bharata race, having bathed in the tirtha of Kasiswara, one<br>becometh freed from all diseases and is adored in the abode of Brahma.<br>There, in that tirtha, is another called Matri. One that bathes in Matri<br>tirtha hath a large progeny and obtaineth, O king, great prosperity. One<br>should next proceed with subdued sense and regulated diet to the tirtha<br>called Shitavana. And, O great king, it hath been seen that one merit of<br>that tirtha which rarely belongs to any other, is that one only going<br>thither obtaineth holiness. By casting off his hair in that tirtha one<br>acquireth, O Bharata, great sanctity. There, in that tirtha, is another<br>called Shwavillomapaha, where, O tiger among men, and chief of the<br>Bharata race, learned Brahmanas that go to tirthas obtain great<br>satisfaction by a dip into its waters. Good Brahmanas, O king, by casting<br>off their hair in that tirtha acquire holiness by Pranayama and finally<br>attain to a high state. There, O king, in that tirtha is also another<br>called Dasaswamedhika. Bathing there, O tiger among men, one attains to a<br>high state. One should next proceed, O king, to the celebrated tirtha<br>called Manusha where, O king, a number of black antelopes afflicted by<br>the hunter's arrows, plunging into its waters, were transformed into<br>human beings. Bathing in that tirtha, leading a Brahmacharya mode of life<br>and with concentrated soul, a man becomes freed from all his sins and is<br>adored in heaven. Distant by a krosa, O king, to the east of Manusha<br>there is a river celebrated by the name of Apaga that is restored to by<br>the Siddhas. The man that offereth there the syamaka grain in honour of<br>the gods and the Pitris acquireth great religious merit. And if one<br>Brahmana is fed there, it becomes equivalent to feeding ten millions of<br>Brahmanas. Having bathed in that tirtha and worshipped the gods and the<br>Pitris and resided there for one night, a man obtaineth the merit of the<br>Agnishtoma sacrifice. One should then repair, O king, to that excellent<br>region of Brahma which, O Bharata, is known on earth by the name of<br>Brahmodumvara. Bathing in the tank of the seven Rishis that is there, O<br>bull among men, with pure mind and subdued soul, as also in the tirtha<br>called Kedara of the high-souled Kapila, and beholding Brahma who is<br>there, one's soul being purified from all sins, one goeth to the abode of<br>Brahma. Proceeding next to the inaccessible tirtha called Kedara of<br>Kapila, and burning one's sins there by ascetic penances, one acquireth<br>the power of disappearance at will. One should next proceed, O king, to<br>the celebrated tirtha called Saraka, and beholding Mahadeva there on the<br>fourteenth day of the dark fortnight, one obtaineth all his wishes and<br>goeth also into heaven. O son of the Kuru race, in Saraka and Rudrakoti<br>as also in the well and the lakes that are there, thirty millions of<br>tirthas are present. There in that tirtha, O chief of the Bharatas, is<br>another called Ilaspada. Bathing there and worshipping the gods and the<br>Pitris, one never sinketh into hell but obtaineth the fruit of the<br>Vajapeya sacrifice. Repairing next to Kindana and Kinjapya, one<br>acquireth, O Bharata, the merit of giving away in measureless abundance<br>and the infinite recitation of prayers. Repairing next to the tirtha<br>called Kalasi and bathing there devoutly and with the senses under<br>control, a man obtaineth the fruit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. To the<br>east of Saraka, O chief of the Kurus, there is an auspicious tirtha known<br>by the name of Anajanma, of the high-souled Narada. He that bathes there,<br>O Bharata, obtaineth, after death, at the command of Narada various<br>unrivalled regions. One should next proceed, on the tenth day of the<br>lighted fortnight, to the tirtha called Pundarika. Bathing there, O king,<br>one obtaineth the merit of the Pundarika sacrifice. One should next<br>proceed to the tirtha called Tripishtapa that is known over the three<br>worlds. There in that tirtha is the sacred and sin-destroying river<br>called Vaitarani. Bathing there and adoring the god known by the mark of<br>the bull and holding the trident in his hand, one's soul being purified<br>from every sin one attaineth to the highest state. One should next<br>proceed, O king, to the excellent tirtha called Phalakivana. There in<br>that tirtha the gods, O monarch, having been present, performed their<br>ascetic austerities extending for many thousand years. One should then<br>proceed to the Dhrishadwati. Bathing there and worshipping the gods, one<br>obtaineth, O Bharata, merit that is superior to that of both the<br>Agnishtoma and the Atiratra sacrifices. O chief of the Bharatas, bathing<br>in that tirtha called Sarvadeva, a man obtaineth, O king, the merit of<br>giving away a thousand kine. Bathing next in the tirtha called Panikhata<br>and worshipping all the gods, a man obtaineth merit that is superior to<br>that of both the Agnishtoma and the Atiratra sacrifices, besides<br>acquiring that of the Rajasuya sacrifice and finally going into the<br>region of the Rishis. One should next proceed, O virtuous one, to that<br>excellent tirtha called Misraka. There, O tiger among kings, it hath been<br>heard by us that the high-souled Vyasa, for the sake of the Brahmanas,<br>hath mixed all the tirthas. He, therefore, that bathes in Misraka really<br>bathes in all the tirtha. One should next proceed with subdued senses and<br>regulated diet, to the tirtha called Vyasavana. Bathing in the tirtha<br>called Manojava that is there, one obtaineth the merit of the gift of a<br>thousand kine. Proceeding next to the Devi tirtha that is in Madhuvati,<br>one that bathes there and worships the gods and the Pitris obtains at the<br>command of the Goddess the merit of the gift of a thousand kine.<br>Proceeding with regulated diet, he that bathes in the confluence of the<br>Kausiki and the Drishadwati, becometh free from all his sins. One should<br>next proceed to Vyasasthali where Vyasa of great intelligence, burning<br>with grief for his son had resolved to cast off his body but was cheered<br>again by the gods. Proceeding to that spot of Vyasa, one obtaineth the<br>merit of a thousand kine. O son of the Kuru race, proceeding next to the<br>well called Kindatta, he that throweth into it a measure of sesame, is<br>freed from all his debts and obtaineth his success. Bathing in the tirtha<br>called Vedi, one obtaineth the merit of the gift of a thousand kine.<br>There are two other celebrated tirthas called Ahas and Sudina. Bathing<br>there, O tiger among men, one goeth to the region of the Sun. One should<br>next proceed to the tirtha called Mrigadhuma that is celebrated<br>throughout the three worlds. One should bathe there, O king, in Ganga.<br>Bathing there and worshipping Mahadeva, one obtaineth the merit of the<br>horse-sacrifice. Bathing next in the Devi tirtha one obtaineth the merit<br>of the gift of a thousand kine. One should then proceed to Vamanaka<br>celebrated over the three worlds. Bathing there in Vishnupada and<br>worshipping Vamana one's soul being purified from every sin, one goeth to<br>the abode of Vishnu. Bathing next in Kulampuna, one sanctifieth his own<br>race. Proceeding then to the Pavana-hrada, that excellent tirtha of the<br>Marutas, and bathing there, O king and tiger among men, one becometh<br>adored in the region of the Wind-god. Bathing in the Amara-hrada and<br>worshipping with devotion the chief of the celestials, one becometh<br>adored in heaven and courseth, seated on an excellent car, in the company<br>of the immortals. O best of great men, bathing next with due rites in the<br>tirtha called Sali surya, of Salihotra, one obtaineth the merit of the<br>gift of a thousand kine. O best of the Bharatas, there is a tirtha called<br>Sreekunja in the Saraswati. Bathing there, O best of men, one obtaineth<br>the merit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. O son of the Kuru race, one should<br>next repair to Naimishakunja. O king, the Rishis engaged in ascetic<br>austerities in the woods of Naimisha had, in days of old, taking the vow<br>of pilgrimage, gone to Kurukshetra. There, on the banks of the Saraswati,<br>O chief of the Bharatas, a grove was made, which might serve for a<br>resting spot for themselves, and which was highly gratifying to them.<br>Bathing in the Saraswati there, one obtaineth the merit of the Agnishtoma<br>sacrifice. One should next proceed, O virtuous one, to the excellent<br>tirtha called Kanya. Bathing there one obtaineth the merit of the gift of<br>a thousand kine. One should next proceed to the excellent tirtha of<br>Brahma. Bathing there, a person, of the (three) inferior orders,<br>obtaineth the status of a Brahmana, and if one be a Brahmana, his soul<br>being purified from every sin, he attaineth to the highest state. One<br>should then, O best of men, proceed to the excellent tirtha called Soma.<br>Bathing there, O king, one obtaineth the region of Soma. One should next<br>proceed, O king, to the tirtha called Saptasaraswata, where the<br>celebrated Rishi, Mankanaka, had obtained ascetic success. O king, it<br>hath been heard by us that in days of old Mankanaka having cut his hand<br>with the pointed blade of the Kusa grass, there flowed from his wound<br>vegetable juice (instead of blood). And beholding vegetable juice flow<br>from his wound, the Rishi began to dance with wonder-expanded eyes. And<br>as the Rishi danced, all the mobile and immobile creatures also,<br>overwhelmed with his prowess, began to dance with him. Then, O king, the<br>gods with Brahma at their head and Rishis endued with the wealth of<br>asceticism moved by the act of Mankanaka, represented the matter to<br>Mahadeva, saying, 'It behoveth thee, O god, to act in such a way that<br>this Rishi may not dance.' Thus addressed, Mahadeva, with heart filled<br>with joy, approached the dancing Rishi, and moved by the desire of doing<br>good to the gods, said, 'O great Rishi, O virtuous one, why dost thou<br>dance? O bull among Munis, what can be the reason of this thy present<br>joy?' The Rishi answered, 'O best of Brahmanas, I am an ascetic that<br>tread the path of virtue. Dost thou not behold, O Brahmana, that<br>vegetable juice floweth from the wound in my hand? Filled with great joy<br>at sight of this, I am dancing.' Addressing the Rishi blinded by emotion,<br>the god laughingly said, 'O Brahmana, I do not wonder at this. Behold<br>me.' Having said this, O best of men, Mahadeva, O sinless king, pressed<br>his thumb by the tip of his own finger. And, lo, from the wound thus<br>inflicted, there came out ashes white as snow. And beholding this, O<br>king, that Muni became ashamed and fell at the feet of the god. And<br>believing that there was nothing better and greater than the god Rudra,<br>he began to adore him in these words:<br><br>"O holder of the trident, thou art the refuge of the celestials and the<br>Asuras, of, indeed, the universe. By thee have been created the three<br>worlds with their mobile and immobile beings. It is thou again that<br>swallowest everything at the end of the Yuga. Thou art incapable of being<br>known by the gods themselves, far less by me. O sinless one, the gods<br>with Brahma at their heads are all displayed in thee. Thou art all, the<br>Creator himself and the Ordainer of the worlds. It is by thy grace that<br>all the gods sport without anxiety or fear. And adoring Mahadeva thus the<br>Rishi also said, 'O god of gods, grant me thy grace, so that my<br>asceticism may not diminish.' Then that god of cheerful soul answered the<br>regenerate Rishi,&#8212;saying, 'Let thy asceticism, O Brahmana, increase a<br>thousandfold through my grace. And, O great Muni, I shall dwell with thee<br>in this thy asylum. Bathing in Saptasaraswata, they that will worship me,<br>shall be able to attain everything here and hereafter. And, without<br>doubt, they shall all attain to the Saraswata region in the end.' Having<br>said this, Mahadeva disappeared then and there.<br><br>"After visiting Saraswata, one should proceed to Ausanasa celebrated over<br>the three worlds. There, O Bharata, the gods with Brahma at their head,<br>and Rishis endued with wealth of asceticism, and the illustrious<br>Kartikeya, were ever present during two twilights and the mid-day,<br>impelled by the desire of doing good to Bhargava. There in that tirtha is<br>another called Kapalamochana, which cleanseth from every sin. O tiger<br>among men, bathing there one is cleansed from every sin. One should then<br>proceed to the tirtha called Agni. Bathing there, O bull among men, one<br>obtaineth the regions of agni and raiseth his own race (from lower<br>regions). There in that tirtha is another, O chief of the Bharatas, that<br>belongeth to Viswamitra. Bathing there, O best of men, one obtaineth the<br>status of a Brahmana. Proceeding next to Brahmayoni in purity of body and<br>with subdued soul, one obtaineth, O tiger among men, by bathing there,<br>the abode of Brahma, and sanctifieth, without doubt, his own race to the<br>seventh generation up and down. One should next proceed, O king, to the<br>tirtha celebrated over the three worlds, which is called Prithudaka,<br>belonging to Kartikeya. One should bathe there and occupy oneself in the<br>worship of the Pitris and the gods. Whatever evil hath been committed,<br>knowingly or unknowingly, by man or woman, impelled by human motives, is<br>all destroyed, O Bharata, by a bath in that tirtha. Bathing there one<br>obtaineth, too, the merit of the horse-sacrifice and heaven also. The<br>learned have said that Kurukshetra is holy; that holier than Kurukshetra<br>is the Saraswati; that holier than the Saraswati are all the tirthas<br>together, and that holier than all the tirthas together is Prithudaka. He<br>that engaged in the recitation of prayers casteth off his body at<br>Prithudaka, which is the best of all tirthas, becometh an immortal. It<br>hath been sung by Sanatkumara and by the high-souled Vyasa, and it is in<br>the Vedas also, that one should, O king, go to Prithudaka, with subdued<br>soul. O son of Kuru race, there is no tirtha which is superior to<br>Prithudaka. Without doubt, that tirtha is purifying, holy and<br>sin-destroying. O best of men, it hath been said by learned persons that<br>men, however sinful, by bathing in Prithudaka, go to heaven. O best of<br>the Bharatas, there in that tirtha is another called Madhusrava. Bathing<br>there, O king, one obtaineth the merit of giving away a thousand kine.<br>One should then proceed, O king, to that celebrated and sacred tirtha<br>where the Saraswati uniteth with the Aruna. One that batheth there,<br>having fasted for three nights, is cleansed of even the sin of slaying a<br>Brahmana, and obtaineth also merit that is superior to that of either the<br>Agnishtoma or Atiratra sacrifice, and rescueth his race to the seventh<br>generation up and down. There in that tirtha is another, O perpetuator of<br>the Kuru race, that is called Ardhakila. From compassion for the<br>Brahmanas, that tirtha was made by Darbhi in days of old. Without doubt,<br>by vows, by investiture of the sacred, by fasts, by rites and by Mantras,<br>one becometh a Brahmana. O bull among men, it hath been seen, however, by<br>learned persons of old that even one destitute of rites and Mantras, by<br>only bathing in that tirtha becometh learned and endued with the merit of<br>vows. Darbhi had also brought hither the four oceans. O best of men, one<br>that batheth here, never meeteth with distress hereafter and obtaineth<br>also the merit of giving away four thousand kine. One should next repair,<br>O virtuous one, to the tirtha called Satasahasraka. Near to this is<br>another called Sahasraka. Both are celebrated, and one that batheth in<br>them, obtaineth the merit of giving away a thousand kine. Fasts and gifts<br>there multiply a thousandfold. One should next proceed, O king, to the<br>excellent tirtha called Renuka. One should bathe there and worship the<br>Pitris and the gods. By this, cleansed from every sin, he obtaineth the<br>merit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. Bathing next in the tirtha called<br>Vimochana with passions and senses under control, one is cleansed from<br>all the sins generated by the acceptance of gifts. With senses under<br>control and practising the Brahmacharya mode of life, one should next<br>repair to the woods of Panchavati. By a sojourn thither, one earneth much<br>virtue and becometh adored in the regions of the virtuous. One should<br>next go to the tirtha of Varuna called Taijasa, blazing in effulgence of<br>its own. There in that tirtha is the lord of Yoga, Sthanu himself, having<br>for his vehicle the bull. He that sojourneth there, obtaineth success by<br>worshipping the god of gods. It was there that the gods with Brahma at<br>their head and Rishis endued with wealth of asceticism, installed Guha as<br>the generalissimo of the celestials. To the east of that tirtha is<br>another, O perpetuator of Kuru race, that is called Kuru tirtha. With<br>senses under control and leading a Brahmacharya mode of life, he that<br>bathes in Kuru-tirtha, becometh cleansed of all his sins and obtaineth<br>the region of Brahma. With subdued senses and regulated diet one should<br>next proceed to Svargadwara. Sojourning thither, one obtaineth the merit<br>of the Agnishtoma sacrifice and goeth to the abode of Brahma. The pilgrim<br>should then, O king, proceed to the tirtha called Anaraka. Bathing there,<br>O king, one never meeteth with distress hereafter. There, O king, Brahma<br>himself with the other gods having Narayana at their head, is ever<br>present, O tiger among men! And, O royal son of the Kuru race, the wife<br>also of Rudra is present there. Beholding the goddess, one never meeteth<br>with distress hereafter. There in that tirtha O king, is also (an image<br>of) Visweswara, the lord of Uma. Beholding the god of gods there, one is<br>cleansed of all his sins. Beholding also (the image of) Narayana from<br>whose navel had sprung the lotus, one blazeth forth, O royal represser of<br>all foes, and goeth to the abode of Vishnu. O bull among men, he that<br>batheth in the tirthas of all the gods, is exempted from every sorrow and<br>blazeth forth like the Moon. The pilgrim should next proceed, O king, to<br>Swastipura. By walking around that place, one obtaineth the merit of<br>giving away a thousand kine. Arriving next at the tirtha called Pavana,<br>one should offer oblations to the Pitris and the gods. By this, he<br>obtaineth, O Bharata, the merit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. Near to that<br>is Ganga-hrada, and another, O Bharata, called Kupa. Thirty millions of<br>tirthas, O king, are present in that Kupa. Bathing there, O king, a<br>person obtaineth heaven. Bathing also in the Ganga-hrada and adoring<br>Maheswara, one obtaineth the status of Ganapatya and rescueth his own<br>race. One should next proceed to Sthanuvata, celebrated over the three<br>worlds. Bathing there, O king, one obtaineth heaven. One should then<br>proceed to Vadaripachana, the asylum of Vasishtha. Having tasted there<br>for three nights, one should eat jujubes. He that liveth on jujubes for<br>twelve years, and he that fasteth at the tirtha for three nights,<br>acquireth merit that is eternal. Arriving then at Indramarga, O king, and<br>fasting there for a day and night the pilgrim becometh adored in the<br>abode of Indra. Arriving next at the tirtha called Ekaratra, a person<br>that stayeth there for one night, with regulated vows and refraining from<br>untruth, becometh adored in the abode of Brahma. One should next go, O<br>king, to the asylum of Aditya&#8212;that illustrious god who is a mass of<br>effulgence. Bathing in that tirtha celebrated over three worlds, and<br>worshipping the god of light, one goeth to the region of Aditya and<br>rescueth his own race. The pilgrim then, O king, bathing in the tirtha of<br>Soma, obtaineth, without doubt, the region of Soma. One should next<br>proceed, O virtuous one, to the most sacred tirtha of the illustrious<br>Dadhicha, that sanctifying tirtha which is celebrated over the whole<br>world. It was here that Angiras, that ocean of ascetic austerities<br>belonging to the Saraswata race, was born, Bathing in that tirtha, one<br>obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice, and without doubt, gaineth<br>also residence in the legion of Saraswati. With subdued senses and<br>leading a Brahmacharya mode of life, one should next proceed to<br>Kanyasrama. Residing there for three nights, O king, with subdued senses<br>and regulated diet, one obtaineth a hundred celestial damsels and goeth<br>also to the abode of Brahma. One should next, O virtuous one, proceed to<br>the tirtha called Sannihati. Sojourning thither the gods with Brahma at<br>their head and Rishis endued with wealth of asceticism earn much virtue.<br>Bathing in the Saraswati during a solar eclipse, one obtaineth the merit<br>of a hundred horse-sacrifices, and any sacrifice that one may perform<br>there produceth merit that is eternal. Whatever tirthas exist on earth or<br>in the firmament, all the rivers, lakes, smaller lakes, springs, tanks,<br>large and small, and spots sacred to particular gods, without doubt, all<br>come, O tiger among men, month after month, and mingle with Sannihati, O<br>king of men! And it is because that all other tirthas are united together<br>here, that this tirtha is so called. Bathing there and drinking of its<br>water, one becometh adored in heaven. Listen now, O king, to the merit<br>acquired by that mortal who performeth a Sraddha on the day of the new<br>moon during a solar eclipse. The person that performeth a Sraddha there,<br>after having bathed in that tirtha, obtaineth the merit that one earneth<br>by properly celebrating a thousand horse-sacrifices. Whatever sins a man<br>or woman committeth, are, without doubt, all destroyed as soon as one<br>batheth in that tirtha. Bathing there one also ascendeth to the abode of<br>Brahma on the lotus-coloured tar. Bathing next in Koti-tirtha, after<br>having worshipped the Yaksha doorkeeper, Machakruka, one obtaineth the<br>merit of giving away gold in abundance. Near to this, O best of the<br>Bharatas, is a tirtha called Gangahrada. One should bathe there, O<br>virtuous one, with subdued soul and leading a Brahmacharya mode of life.<br>By this, one obtaineth merit that is greater than that of a Rajasuya and<br>horse-sacrifices. The tirtha called Naimisha is productive of good on<br>earth. Pushkara is productive of good in the regions of the firmament;<br>Kurukshetra, however, is productive of good in respect of all the three<br>worlds. Even the dust of Kurukshetra, carried by the wind, leadeth sinful<br>men to a highly blessed state. They that reside in Kurukshetra, which<br>lieth to the north of the Drishadwati and the south of the Saraswati,<br>really reside in heaven. 'I will go to Kurukshetra,' 'I will dwell in<br>Kurukshetra,' he that uttereth those words even once, becometh cleansed<br>of all sins. The sacred Kurukshetra which is worshipped by Brahmarshis,<br>is regarded as the sacrificial altar of the celestials. Those mortals<br>that dwell there, have nothing to grieve for at any time. That which<br>lieth between Tarantuka and Arantuka and the lakes of Rama and Machakruka<br>is Kurukshetra. It is also called Samantapanchaka and is said to be the<br>northern sacrificial altar of the Grandsire.'
