                            (Kirmirabadha Parva)<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'O Kshatta, I am desirous to hear of the destruction<br>of Kirmira! Do thou tell me how the encounter took place between the<br>Rakshasa and Bhimasena!'<br><br>"Vidura said, 'Listen to the story of that feat of Bhimasena of super<br>human achievements! I have often heard of it in course of my conversation<br>with the Pandavas (while I was with them)<br><br>'O foremost of kings, defeated at dice the Pandavas departed from hence<br>and travelling for three days and nights they at length reached those<br>woods that go by the name of Kamyaka. O king, just after the dreadful<br>hour of midnight when all nature is asleep, when man-eating Rakshasas of<br>terrible deeds begin to wander, the ascetics and the cowherds and other<br>rangers of the forest used to shun the woods of Kamyaka and fly to a<br>distance from fear of cannibals. And, O Bharata, as the Pandavas were at<br>this hour entering those woods a fearful Rakshasa of flaming eyes<br>appeared before them with a lighted brand, obstructing their path. And<br>with outstretched arms and terrible face, he stood obstructing the way on<br>which those perpetuators of the Kuru race were proceeding. With eight<br>teeth standing out, with eyes of coppery hue, and with the hair of his<br>head blazing and standing erect, the fiend looked like a mass of clouds<br>reflecting the rays of the sun or mingled with lightning flashes and<br>graced with flocks of cranes underneath on their wings. And uttering<br>frightful yells and roaring like a mass of clouds charged with rain, the<br>fiend began to spread the illusion proper to his species. Hearing that<br>terrible roar, birds along with other creatures that live on land or in<br>water, began to drop down in all directions, uttering cries of fear. And<br>in consequence of the deer and the leopards and the buffaloes and the<br>bears flying about in all directions, it seemed as if the forest itself<br>was in motion. And swayed by the wind raised by the sighs of the<br>Rakshasa, creepers growing at a great distance seemed to embrace the<br>trees with their arms of coppery leaves. And at that moment, a violent<br>wind began to blow, and the sky became darkened with the dust that<br>covered it. And as grief is the greatest enemy of the object of the five<br>senses, even so appeared before the Pandavas that unknown foe of theirs.<br>And beholding the Pandavas from a distance clad in black deer-skins, the<br>Rakshasa obstructed their passage through the forest even like the<br>Mainaka mountain. And at the sight of him never seen before the<br>lotus-eyed Krishna, agitated with fear, closed her eyes. And she whose<br>braids had been dishevelled by the hand of Dussasana, stationed in the<br>midst of the five Pandavas, looked like a stream chafing amid five hills.<br>And seeing her overwhelmed with fear the five Pandavas supported her as<br>the five senses influenced by desire adhere to the pleasures relating to<br>their objects. And Dhaumya of great (ascetic) energy, in the presence of<br>the sons of Pandu, destroyed the fearful illusion that had been spread by<br>the Rakshasa, by applying various mantras, calculated to destroy the<br>Rakshasa. And beholding his illusion dispelled, the mighty Rakshasa of<br>crooked ways, capable of assuming any form at will, expanded his eyes in<br>wrath and seemed like death himself. Then king Yudhishthira, endued with<br>great wisdom, addressed him saying, 'Who art thou, and whose (son)? Tell<br>us what we should do for thee.' The Rakshasa thus addressed, answered<br>Yudhishthira the just, saying, 'I am the brother of Vaka, the celebrated<br>Kirmira. I live at ease in these deserted woods of Kamyaka, daily<br>procuring my food by vanquishing men in fight. Who are ye that have come<br>near me in the shape of my food? Defeating ye all in fight, I will eat ye<br>with pleasure.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'O Bharata, hearing these words of the wretch,<br>Yudhishthira announced his own name and lineage, saying, 'I am king<br>Yudhishthira the just, the son of Pandu, of whom thou mayst have heard.<br>Deprived of my kingdom, I have with my brothers Bhimasena and Arjuna and<br>the others, in course of my wanderings, come into this terrible forest<br>which is thy dominion, desirous of passing my period of exile here!'<br><br>"Vidura continued, 'Kirmira said unto Yudhishthira, 'By good luck it is<br>that fate hath accomplished today my long-accomplished desire! With<br>weapons upraised have I been continually ranging the entire earth with<br>the object of slaying Bhima. But Bhima I had found not. By good luck it<br>is that slayer of my brother, whom I had been seeking so long, hath come<br>before me! It was he who in the disguise of a Brahmana slew my dear<br>brother Vaka in the Vetrakiya forest by virtue of his science. He hath<br>truly no strength of arms! It is also this one of wicked soul who<br>formerly slew my dear friend Hidimva, living in this forest and ravished<br>his sister! And that fool hath now come into this deep forest of mine,<br>when the night is half spent, even at the time when we wander about!<br>Today I will wreak my long-cherished vengeance upon him, and I will today<br>gratify (the manes of) Vaka with his blood in plenty! By slaying this<br>enemy of the Rakshasas, I shall today be freed from the debt I owe to my<br>friend and my brother, and thereby attain supreme happiness! If Bhimasena<br>was let free formerly by Vaka, today, I will devour him in thy sight, O<br>Yudhishthira! And even as Agastya ate up and digested the mighty Asura<br>(Vatapi) I will eat up and digest this Bhima!'<br><br>"Vidura continued, 'Thus addressed by the Rakshasa, the virtuous<br>Yudhishthira, steadfast in his pledges, said, 'It can never be so,&#8212;and<br>in anger rebuked the Rakshasa.' The mighty-armed Bhima then tore up in<br>haste a tree of the length of ten Vyasas and stripped it of its leaves.<br>And in the space of a moment the ever-victorious Arjuna stringed his bow<br>Gandiva possessing the force of the thunderbolt. And, O Bharata, making<br>Jishnu desist, Bhima approached that Rakshasa still roaring like the<br>clouds and said unto him, 'Stay! Stay!' And thus addressing the cannibal,<br>and tightening the cloth around his waist, and rubbing his palms, and<br>biting his nether lip with his teeth, and armed with the tree, the<br>powerful Bhima rushed towards the foe. And like unto Maghavat hurling his<br>thunderbolt, Bhima made that tree, resembling the mace of Yama himself<br>descend with force on the head of the cannibal. The Rakshasa, however,<br>was seen to remain unmoved at that blow, and wavered not in the conflict.<br>On the other hand, he hurled his lighted brand, flaming like lightning,<br>at Bhima. But that foremost of warriors turned it off with his left foot<br>in such a way that it went back towards the Rakshasa. Then the fierce<br>Kirmira on his part, all on a sudden uprooting a tree darted to the<br>encounter like unto the mace bearing Yama himself. And that fight, so<br>destructive of the trees, looked like the encounter in days of yore<br>between the brothers Vali and Sugriva for the possession of the same<br>woman. And the trees struck at the heads of the combatants, were broken<br>into shivers, like lotus-stalks thrown on the temples of infuriate<br>elephants. And in that great forest, innumerable trees, crushed like unto<br>reeds, lay scattered as rags. That encounter with trees between that<br>foremost of Rakshasas and that best of men, O thou bull of the Bharata<br>race, lasted but for a moment. Then taking up a crag, the angry Rakshasa<br>hurled it at Bhima standing before him, but the latter wavered not. Then<br>like unto Rahu going to devour the sun dispersing his rays with extended<br>arms, the Rakshasa with out-stretched arms darted towards Bhima, who had<br>remained firm under the blow inflicted with the crag. And tugging at and<br>grappling with each other in diverse ways they appeared like two<br>infuriate bulls struggling with each other. Or like unto two mighty<br>tigers armed with teeth and claws, the encounter between them waxed<br>fierce and hard. And remembering their (late) disgrace at the hands of<br>Duryodhana, and proud of the strength of his arms, and conscious also of<br>Krishna looking at him, Vrikodara began to swell in vigour. And fried<br>with anger, Bhima seized the Rakshasa with his arms, as one elephant in<br>rut seizeth another. And the powerful Rakshasa also in his turn seized<br>his adversary, but Bhimasena that foremost of all men endued with<br>strength, threw the cannibal down with violence. The sounds that in<br>consequence of those mighty combatants pressing each other's hands, were<br>frightful and resembled the sounds of splintering bamboos. And hurling<br>the Rakshasa down, seized him by the waist, and began to whirl him about,<br>even as fierce hurricane shaketh a tree. And thus seized by the mighty<br>Bhima, the fatigued Rakshasa, became faint, and trembling all over, he<br>still pressed the (Pandava) with all his strength. And finding him<br>fatigued, Vrikodara, twined his own arms round the foe, even as one<br>bindeth a beast with cord. And the monster thereupon began to roar<br>frightfully, as a trumpet out of order. And the mighty Vrikodara for a<br>long while whirled the Rakshasa till the latter appeared to be<br>insensible, and began to move convulsively. And finding the Rakshasa<br>exhausted, the son of Pandu without loss of time took him up in his arms,<br>and slew him like a beast. And placing his knee on the waist of that<br>wretch of Rakshasa, Vrikodara began to press the neck of the foe with his<br>hands. Then Bhima, dragging along the earth the bruised body of the<br>Rakshasa with the eye-lids about to close, said, 'O sinful wretch, thou<br>wilt no more have to wipe away the tears of Hidimva or Vaka, for thou too<br>art about to go to the mansions of Yama!' And saying this, that foremost<br>of men, his heart filled with wrath, beholding the Rakshasa destitute of<br>clothing and ornaments, and insensible, and undergoing convulsions, let<br>him dead. And after that Rakshasa of hue like the clouds had been slain,<br>the son of that best of kings (Pandu) praised Bhima for his many<br>qualities, and placing Krishna in their front, set out for the Dwaita<br>woods."<br><br>Vidura said, 'It was thus, O lord of men, that Kirmira was slain in<br>combat by Bhima, in obedience, O Kaurava, to the commands of Yudhishthira<br>the just! And having rid the forest of its pest, the victorious<br>Yudhishthira the just, began to live in that dwelling of theirs, with<br>Draupadi. And those bulls of the Bharata race comforting Draupadi began<br>to cheerfully extol Bhima with glad hearts. And after the Rakshasa had<br>been slain, borne down by the might of Bhima's arms, those heroes entered<br>into the peaceful forest freed from its annoyance. Passing through the<br>great forest I saw lying the body of the wicked and fearless Rakshasa<br>slain by Bhima's might. And, O Bharata, there I heard of this achievement<br>of Bhima from those Brahmanas who have assembled round the Pandavas.'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing the account of the slaughter in combat<br>of Kirmira, that foremost of Rakshasas, the king sighed in sorrow and<br>became absorbed in thought.'"
