                            Vaisampayana continued, "Then all the artisans, the principal<br>counsellors, and the highly wise Vidura said unto Dhritarashtra's son,<br>"All the preparations for the excellent sacrifice have been made, O king;<br>and the time also hath come, O Bharata. And the exceedingly precious<br>golden plough hath been constructed.' Hearing this, O monarch, that best<br>of kings, Dhritarashtra's son commanded that prime among sacrifices to be<br>commenced. Then commenced that sacrifice sanctified by mantras, and<br>abounding in edibles, and the son of Gandhari was duly initiated<br>according to the ordinance. And Dhritarashtra, and the illustrious<br>Vidura, and Bhishma, and Drona, and Kripa, and Karna, and the celebrated<br>Gandhari experienced great delight. And, O foremost of kings, Duryodhana<br>despatched swift messengers to invite the princes and the Brahmanas. And<br>mounting fleet vehicles they went to the (respective) directions assigned<br>to them. Then to a certain messenger on the point of setting out,<br>Dussasana said, 'Go thou speedily to the woods of Dwaita; and in that<br>forest duly invite the Brahmanas and those wicked persons, the Pandavas.'<br>Thereupon, he repaired thither, and bowing down to all the Pandavas,<br>said, 'Having acquired immense wealth by his native prowess, that best of<br>kings and foremost of Kurus, Duryodhana, O monarch, is celebrating a<br>sacrifice. Thither are going from various directions the kings and the<br>Brahmanas. O king, I have been sent by the high-souled Kaurava. That king<br>and lord of men, Dhritarashtra's son, invites you. It behoveth you,<br>therefore, to witness the delightful sacrifice of that monarch.'<br><br>"Hearing these words of the messenger, that tiger among kings, the royal<br>Yudhishthira, said, 'By good luck it is that that enhancer of the glory<br>of his ancestors, king Suyodhana is celebrating this best of sacrifices.<br>We should certainly repair thither; but we cannot do now; for till (the<br>completion of) the thirteenth year, we shall have to observe our vow.'<br>Hearing this speech of Yudhishthira the just, Bhima said these words,<br>'Then will king Yudhishthira the just go thither, when he will cast him<br>(Duryodhana) into the fire kindled by weapons. Do thou say unto<br>Suyodhana. 'When after the expiration of the thirteenth year, that lord<br>of men, the Pandava, will, in the sacrifice of battle, pour upon the<br>Dhritarashtras, the clarified butter of his ire, then will I come!' But<br>the other Pandavas, O king, did not say anything unpleasant. The<br>messenger (on his return) related unto Dhritarashtra's son all as it had<br>fallen out. Then there came to the city of Dhritarashtra many foremost of<br>men, lords of various countries, and highly virtuous Brahmanas. And duly<br>received in order according to the ordinance, those lords of men<br>experienced great delight and were all well-pleased. And that foremost<br>among monarchs&#8212;Dhritarashtra&#8212;surrounded by all the Kauravas,<br>experienced the height of joy, and spake unto Vidura, saying, 'Do thou, O<br>Kshatta, speedily so act that all persons in the sacrificial compound may<br>be served with food, be refreshed and satisfied.' Thereupon, O represser<br>of foes, assenting to that order, the learned Vidura versed in morality,<br>cheerfully entertained all the orders in proper measure with meat and<br>beverages to eat and drink, and fragrant garland and various kinds of<br>attire. And having constructed pavilions (for their accommodation), that<br>hero and foremost of kings, duly entertained the princes and the<br>Brahmanas by thousands, and also bestowing upon them wealth of various<br>kinds, bade them farewell. And having dismissed all the kings, he entered<br>Hastinapura, surrounded by his brothers, and in company with Karna and<br>Suvala's son."
