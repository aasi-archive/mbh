                            "Lomasa said, 'Armed with the Vajra then, and supported by celestials<br>endued with great might, Indra then approached Vritra, who was then<br>occupying the entire earth and the heaven. And he was guarded on all<br>sides by huge-bodied Kalakeyas with upraised weapons resembling gigantic<br>mountains with towering peaks. And the encounter that took place between<br>the gods and the Danavas lasted for a short while and was, O chief of the<br>Bharatas, terrific in the extreme, appalling as it did the three worlds.<br>And loud was the clash of swords and scimitars upraised and warded off by<br>heroic hands in course of those fierce encounters. And heads (severed<br>from trunks) began to roll from the firmament to the earth like fruits of<br>the palmyra palm falling upon the ground, loosened from their stalks. And<br>the Kalakeyas armed with iron-mounted bludgeons and cased in golden mail<br>ran against the gods, like moving mountains on conflagration. And the<br>gods, unable to stand the shock of that impetuous and proudly advancing<br>host, broke and fled from fear. Purandara of a thousand eyes, beholding<br>the gods flying in fear and Vritra growing in boldness, became deeply<br>dejected. And the foremost of gods Purandara, himself, agitated with the<br>fear of the Kalakeyas, without losing a moment, sought the exalted<br>Narayana's refuge. And the eternal Vishnu beholding Indra so depressed<br>enhanced his might by imparting unto him a portion of his own energy. And<br>when the celestials beheld that Sakra was thus protected by Vishnu, each<br>of them imparted unto him his own energy. And the spotless Brahmarshis<br>also imparted their energies unto the chief of the celestials. And<br>favoured thus by Vishnu and all the gods and by the high-blessed Rishis<br>also, Sakra became mightier than before. And when Vritra learnt that the<br>chief of the celestials had been filled with might of others, he sent<br>forth some terrific roars. And at these roars of his, the earth, the<br>directions, the firmament, heaven, and the mountains all began to<br>tremble. And the chief of the celestials, deeply agitated on hearing that<br>fierce and loud roar, was filled with fear, and desiring to slay the<br>Asura soon, hurled, O king, the mighty Vajra. And struck with Indra's<br>Vajra the great Asura decked in gold and garlands fell head-long, like<br>the great mountain Mandara hurled of yore from Vishnu's hands; and<br>although the prince of Daityas was slain, yet Sakra in panic ran from the<br>field, desiring to take shelter in a lake, thinking that the Vajra itself<br>had not been hurled from his hands and regarding that Vritra himself was<br>still alive. The celestials, however, and the great Rishis became filled<br>with joy, and all of them began to cheerfully chant the praise of Indra.<br>And mustering together, the celestials began to slay the Danavas, who<br>were dejected at the death of their leader. And struck with panic at<br>sight of the assembled celestial host, the afflicted Danavas fled to the<br>depths of the sea. And having entered the fathomless deep, teeming with<br>fishes and crocodiles, the Danavas assembled together and began to<br>proudly conspire for the destruction of the three worlds. And some<br>amongst them that were wise in inferences suggested courses of action,<br>each according to his judgment. In course of time, however, the dreadful<br>resolution arrived at those conspiring sons of Diti, was that they<br>should, first of all, compass the destruction of all persons possessed of<br>knowledge and ascetic virtue. The worlds are all supported by asceticism.<br>Therefore, they said, 'Lose no time for the destruction of asceticism.<br>Compass ye without delay the destruction of those on earth that are<br>possessed of ascetic virtues, that are conversant with duties and the<br>ways of morality, and that have a knowledge of Brahma; for when these are<br>destroyed, the universe itself will be destroyed.' And all the Danavas,<br>having arrived at this resolution for the destruction of the universe,<br>became highly glad. And thenceforth they made the ocean&#8212;that abode of<br>Varuna&#8212;with billows high as hills, their fort, from which to make their<br>sallies."
