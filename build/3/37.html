                            Vaisampayana said, "After some time, Yudhishthira the just, remembering<br>the command of the Muni (Vyasa) and calling unto himself that bull among<br>men&#8212;Arjuna&#8212;possessed of great wisdom, addressed him in private. Taking<br>hold of Arjuna's hands, with a smiling face and in gentle accents, that<br>chastiser of foes&#8212;the virtuous Yudhishthira&#8212;apparently after reflecting<br>for a moment, spake these words in private unto Dhananjaya, 'O Bharata,<br>the whole science of arms dwelleth in Bhishma, and Drona, and Kripa, and<br>Karna, and Drona's son. They fully know all sorts of Brahma and celestial<br>and human and Vayavya weapons, together with the modes of using and<br>warding them off. All of them are conciliated and honoured and gratified<br>by Dhritarashtra's son who behaveth unto them as one should behave unto<br>his preceptor. Towards all his warriors Dhritarashtra's son behaveth with<br>great affection; and all the chiefs honoured and gratified by him, seek<br>his good in return. Thus honoured by him, they will not fail to put forth<br>their might. The whole earth, besides, is now under Duryodhana's sway,<br>with all the villages and towns, O son of Pritha, and all the seas and<br>woods and mines! Thou alone art our sole refuge. On thee resteth a great<br>burden. I shall, therefore, O chastiser of all foes, tell thee what thou<br>art to do now. I have obtained a science from Krishna Dwaipayana. Used by<br>thee, that science will expose the whole universe to thee. O child,<br>attentively receive thou that science from me, and in due time (by its<br>aid) attain thou the grace of the celestials. And, O bull of the Bharata<br>race, devote thyself to fierce asceticism. Armed with the bow and sword,<br>and cased in mail, betake thyself to austerities and good vows, and go<br>thou northwards, O child, without giving way to anybody. O Dhananjaya,<br>all celestial weapons are with Indra. The celestials, from fear of<br>Vritra, imparted at the time all their might to Sakra. Gathered together<br>in one place, thou wilt obtain all weapons. Go thou unto Sakra, he will<br>give thee all his weapons. Taking the bow set thou out this very day in<br>order to behold Purandara."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having said this, the exalted Yudhishthira the<br>just, imparted that science unto Arjuna. And the elder brother having<br>communicated with due rites the knowledge unto his heroic brother, with<br>speech and body and mind under perfect control, commanded him to depart.<br>And at the command of Yudhishthira, the strong-armed Arjuna, taking up<br>the Gandiva as also his inexhaustible quivers, and accoutred in mail and<br>gauntlets and finger-protectors made of the skin of the guana, and having<br>poured oblations into the fire and made the Brahmanas to utter<br>benedictions after gifts, set out (from Kamyaka) with the objects of<br>beholding Indra. And armed with the bow, the hero, at the time of setting<br>out heaved a sigh and cast a look upwards for achieving the death of<br>Dhritarashtra's sons. And beholding Kunti's son thus armed and about to<br>set out, the Brahmanas and Siddhas and invisible spirits addressed him,<br>saying, 'O son of Kunti, obtain thou soon what thou wishest.' And the<br>Brahmanas, also uttering benedictions said, 'Achieve thou the object thou<br>hast in view. Let victory be truly thine.' And beholding the heroic<br>Arjuna, of thighs stout as the trunks of the Sala, about to set out<br>taking away with him the hearts of all, Krishna addressed him saying, 'O<br>thou strong-armed one, let all that Kunti had desired at thy birth, and<br>let all that thou desirest, be accomplished, O Dhananjaya! Let no one<br>amongst us be ever again born in the order of Kshatriyas. I always bow<br>down unto the Brahmanas whose mode of living is mendicancy. This is my<br>great grief that the wretch Duryodhana beholding me in the assembly of<br>princes mockingly called me a cow! Besides this he told me in the midst<br>of that assembly many other hard things. But the grief I experience at<br>parting with thee is far greater than any I felt at those insults.<br>Certainly, in thy absence, thy brothers will while away their waking<br>hours in repeatedly talking of thy heroic deeds! If, however, O son of<br>Pritha, thou stayest away for any length of time, we shall derive no<br>pleasure from our enjoyments or from wealth. Nay, life itself will be<br>distasteful to us. O son of Pritha, our weal, and woe, life and death,<br>our kingdom and prosperity, are all dependent on thee. O Bharata, I bless<br>thee, let success be thine. O sinless one, thy (present) task thou wilt<br>be able to achieve even against powerful enemies. O thou of great<br>strength, go thou to win success with speed. Let dangers be not thine. I<br>bow to Dhatri and Vidhatri! I bless thee. Let prosperity be thine. And, O<br>Dhananjaya, let Hri, Sree, Kirti, Dhriti, Pushti, Uma, Lakshmi,<br>Saraswati, all protect thee on thy way, for thou ever worshippest thy<br>elder brother and ever obeyest his commands. And, O bull of the Bharata<br>race, I bow to the Vasus, the Rudras and Adityas, the Manilas, the<br>Viswadevas, and the Sadhyas, for procuring thy welfare. And, O Bharata,<br>be thou safe from all spirits of mischief belonging to the sky, the<br>earth, and the heaven, and from such other spirits generally.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Krishna, the daughter of Yajnasena, having<br>uttered these benedictions, ceased. The strong-armed son of Pandu then,<br>having walked round his brothers and round Dhaumya also, and taking up<br>his handsome bow, set out. And all creatures began to leave the way that<br>Arjuna of great energy and prowess, urged by the desire of beholding<br>Indra, took. And that slayer of foes passed over many mountains inhabited<br>by ascetics, and then reached the sacred Himavat, the resort of the<br>celestials. And the high-souled one reached the sacred mountain in one<br>day, for like the winds he was gifted with the speed of the mind, in<br>consequence of his ascetic austerities. And having crossed the Himavat,<br>as also the Gandhamadana, he passed over many uneven and dangerous spots,<br>walking night and day without fatigue. And having reached Indrakila,<br>Dhananjaya stopped for a moment. And then he heard a voice in the skies,<br>saying, 'Stop!' And hearing that voice, the son of Pandu cast his glances<br>all around. And Arjuna, capable of using his left hand with skill equal<br>to that of his right hand, then beheld before him an ascetic under the<br>shade of a tree, blazing with Brahma brilliancy, of a tawny colour, with<br>matted locks, and thin. And the mighty ascetic, beholding Arjuna stop at<br>t at place, addressed him, saying, 'Who art thou, O child, arrived hither<br>with bow and arrows, and cased in mail and accoutred in scabbard and<br>gauntlet, and (evidently) wedded to the customs of the Kshatriya? There<br>is no need of weapons here. This is the abode of peaceful Brahmanas<br>devoted to ascetic austerities without anger or joy. There is no use for<br>the bow here, for there is no dispute in this place of any kind.<br>Therefore throw away, O child, this bow of thine. Thou hast obtained a<br>pure state of life by coming here. O hero, there is no man who is like<br>thee in energy and prowess.' That Brahmana thus addressed Arjuna, with a<br>smiling face, repeatedly. But he succeeded not in moving Arjuna, firmly<br>devoted to his purpose. The regenerate one, glad at heart, smilingly<br>addressed Arjuna once more, saying, 'O slayer of foes, blest be thou! I<br>am Sakra: ask thou the boon thou desirest.' Thus addressed, that<br>perpetuator of the Kuru race, the heroic Dhananjaya bending his head and<br>joining his hands, replied unto him of a thousand eyes, saying, 'Even<br>this is the object of my wishes; grant me this boon, O illustrious one. I<br>desire to learn from thee all the weapons.' The chief of the celestials<br>then, smiling, replied unto him cheerfully, saying, 'O Dhananjaya, when<br>thou hast reached this region, what need is there of weapons? Thou hast<br>already obtained a pure state of life. Ask thou for the regions of bliss<br>that thou desirest.' Thus addressed, Dhananjaya replied unto him o a<br>thousand eyes, saying, 'I desire not regions of bliss, nor objects of<br>enjoyment, nor the state of a celestial; what is this talk about<br>happiness? O chief of the celestials, I do not desire the prosperity of<br>all the gods. Having left my brothers behind me in the forest, and<br>without avenging myself on the foe, shall I incur the opprobrium for all<br>ages of all the world." Thus addressed, the slayer of Vritra, worshipped<br>of the worlds, consoling him with gentle words, spare unto the son of<br>Pandu, saying, 'When thou art able to behold the three-eyed<br>trident-bearing Siva, the lord of all creatures, it is then, O child,<br>that I will give thee all the celestial weapons. Therefore, strive thou<br>to obtain the sight of the highest of the gods; for it is only after thou<br>hast seen him. O son of Kunti, that thou will obtain all thy wishes.'<br>Having spoken thus unto Phalguna, Sakra disappeared then and there, and<br>Arjuna, devoting himself to asceticism, remained at that spot."
