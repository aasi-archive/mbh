                            Vaisampayana said, "After they had departed, Yudhishthira the virtuous<br>son of Kunti, unwavering in his promises, addressed all his brothers,<br>saying, 'We shall have to dwell in the solitary forest for these twelve<br>years. Search ye, therefore, in this mighty forest for some spot<br>abounding in birds and deer and flowers and fruits, beautiful to behold,<br>and auspicious, and inhabited by virtuous persons and where we may dwell<br>pleasantly for all these years!' Thus addressed by Yudhishthira,<br>Dhananjaya replied unto the son of Dharma, after reverencing the<br>illustrious king as if he were his spiritual preceptor. And Arjuna said,<br>'Thou hast respectfully waited upon all the great and old Rishis. There<br>is nothing unknown to thee in the world of men. And O bull of the Bharata<br>race, thou hast always waited with reverence upon Brahmanas including<br>Dwaipayana and others, and Narada of great ascetic merit, who with senses<br>under control, ever goeth to the gates of all the world from the world of<br>the gods unto that of Brahma, including that of the Gandharvas and<br>Apsaras! And thou knowest, without doubt, the opinions of the Brahmanas,<br>and, O king, their prowess also! And O monarch, thou knowest what is<br>calculated to do us good! And O great king, we will live wherever thou<br>likest! Here is this lake, full of sacred water, called Dwaitavana,<br>abounding with flowers, and delightful to look at, and inhabited by many<br>species of birds. If, O king, it pleaseth thee, here should we like to<br>dwell these twelve years! Thinkest thou otherwise?' Yudhishthira replied,<br>'O Partha, what thou hast said recommendeth itself to me! Let us go that<br>sacred and celebrated and large lake called Dwaitavana!"<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, "Then the virtuous son of Pandu, accompanied by<br>numerous Brahmanas, all went to the sacred lake called Dwaitavana. And<br>Yudhishthira was surrounded by numerous Brahmanas some of whom sacrificed<br>with fire and some without it and some of whom, devoted to the study of<br>the Vedas, lived upon alms or were of the class called Vanaprasthas. And<br>the king was also surrounded by hundreds of Mahatmas crowned with ascetic<br>success and of rigid vows. And those bulls of the Bharata race, the sons<br>of Pandu setting out with those numerous Brahmanas, entered the sacred<br>and delightful woods of Dwaita. And the king saw that mighty forest<br>covered on the close of summer with Salas, and palms, and mangoes, and<br>Madhukas, and Nipas and Kadamvas and Sarjjas and Arjunas, and Karnikars,<br>many of them covered with flowers. And flocks of peacocks and Datyuhas<br>and Chakoras and Varhins and Kokilas, seated on the tops of the tallest<br>trees of that forest were pouring forth their mellifluous notes. And the<br>king also saw in that forest mighty herds of gigantic elephants huge as<br>the hills, with temporal juice trickling down in the season of rut,<br>accompanied by herds of she-elephants. And approaching the beautiful<br>Bhogavati (Saraswati), the king saw many ascetics crowned with success in<br>the habitations in that forest, and virtuous men of sanctified souls clad<br>in barks of trees and bearing matted locks on their heads. And descending<br>from their cars, the king that foremost of virtuous men with his brothers<br>and followers entered that forest like Indra of immeasurable energy<br>entering heaven. And crowds of Charanas and Siddhas, desirous of<br>beholding the monarch devoted to truth, came towards him. And the<br>dwellers of that forest stood surrounding that lion among king possessed<br>of great intelligence. And saluting all the Siddhas, and saluted by them<br>in return as a king or a god should be, that foremost of virtuous men<br>entered the forest with joined hands accompanied by all those foremost of<br>regenerate ones. And the illustrious and virtuous king, saluted in return<br>by those virtuous ascetics that had approached him, sat down in their<br>midst at the foot of a mighty tree decked with flowers, like his father<br>(Pandu) in days before. And those chiefs of the Bharata race viz., Bhima<br>and Dhananjaya and the twins and Krishna and their followers, all<br>fatigued, leaving their vehicles, sat themselves down around that best of<br>kings. And that mighty tree bent down with the weight of creepers, with<br>those five illustrious bowmen who had come there for rest sitting under<br>it, looked like a mountain with (five) huge elephants resting on its<br>side."
