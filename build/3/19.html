                            Vasudeva continued, Thus addressed, the son of Suta race replied in haste<br>unto Pradyumna, that foremost of all endued with strength, in these sweet<br>words, 'O son of Rukmini, I fear not to guide the horses on the field of<br>battle, and I am acquainted also with the customs of the Vrishnis in war!<br>It is not otherwise in the least! But, O thou blest with length of days,<br>those that guide the car are taught that the warrior on the car is, by<br>all means, to be protected by his charioteer! Thou wert also much<br>afflicted! Thou wert much wounded by the arrows shot by Salwa. Thou wert<br>also deprived of thy senses, O hero! Therefore is it that I retired from<br>the field.' But, O chief of the Satwatas, now that thou hast regained thy<br>senses without much ado, do thou, O son of Kesava, witness my skill in<br>guiding the horses! I have been begotten by Daruka, and I have been duly<br>trained! I will now penetrate into the celebrated array of Salwa without<br>fear!<br><br>"Vasudeva continued, 'Saying this, O hero, the charioteer, pulling the<br>reins, began to lead the horses with speed towards the field of battle.<br>And, O king, struck with the whip and pulled by the reins those excellent<br>steeds seemed to be flying in the air, performing various beautiful<br>motion, now circular, now similar, now dissimilar, now to the right, now<br>to the left. And, O king, those steeds understanding as it were the<br>intention of Daruka's son endued with such lightness of hand, burned with<br>energy, and seemed to go without touching the ground with their feet!<br>That bull among men wheeled round Salwa's host so easily that they who<br>witnessed it wondered exceedingly. And the lord of Saubha, unable to bear<br>that manoeuvre of Pradyumna, instantly sent three shafts at the<br>charioteer of his antagonist! The charioteer, however, without taking any<br>note of the force of those arrows, continued to go along the right. Then<br>the lord of Saubha, O hero, again discharged at my son by Rukmini, a<br>shower of various kinds of weapons! But that slayer of hostile heroes,<br>the son of Rukmini, showing with a smile his lightness of hand, cut all<br>those weapons off as they reached him. Finding his arrows cut by<br>Pradyumna, the lord of Saubha, having recourse to the dreadful illusion<br>natural to Asuras began to pour a thick shower of arrows. But cutting<br>into pieces those powerful Daitya weapons shot at him in mid-career by<br>means of his Brahma weapon, Pradyumna discharged winged shafts of other<br>kings. And these delighting in blood, warding off the shafts of Daitya,<br>pierced his head, bosom and face. And at those wounds Salwa fell down<br>senseless. And on the mean-minded Salwa falling down, afflicted with<br>Pradyumna's arrows, the son of Rukmini aimed another arrow at him,<br>capable of destroying every foe. And beholding that arrow worshipped by<br>all the Dasarhas, and flaming like fire and fatal as a venomous snake,<br>fixed on the bow-string, the firmament was filled with exclamations of<br>Oh! and Alas! Then all the celestials with Indra and the lord of<br>treasures (Kubera) at their head sent Narada and the god of wind endued<br>with the speed of the mind. And these two approaching the son of Rukmini<br>delivered unto him the message of the celestial, saying, O hero, king<br>Salwa is nor to be slain by thee! Do thou draw back the arrow. He is<br>unslayable by thee in fight! There breatheth not a person who cannot be<br>killed by that arrow! O thou of mighty arms, the Creator hath ordained<br>his death at the hands of Krishna, the son of Devaki! Let this be not<br>falsified!&#8212;Thereupon with a glad heart, Pradyumna withdrew that best of<br>arrows from his excellent bow and deposited it back in his quiver. And<br>then, O foremost of kings, the mighty Salwa, afflicted with the arrows of<br>Pradyumna, rose disheartened, and speedily went away. Then O king, the<br>wicked Salwa, thus afflicted by the Vrishnis, mounted on his car of<br>precious metals, and leaving Dwaraka scudded through the skies!'"
