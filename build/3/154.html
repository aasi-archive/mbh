                            Vaisampayana said, "Then, O best of the Bharatas, Bhima began to collect<br>those rare unearthly, variegated and fresh flowers in abundance.<br><br>"And it came to pass that a high and violent wind, piercing to the touch,<br>and blowing about gravels, arose, portending battle. And frightful<br>meteors began to shoot, with thundering sounds. And being enveloped by<br>darkness, the sun became pale, his rays being obscured. And on Bhima<br>displaying his prowess, dreadful sounds of explosion rang through the<br>sky. And the earth began to tremble, and dust fell in showers. And the<br>points of the heavens became reddened. And beasts and birds began to cry<br>in shrill tones. And every thing became enveloped in darkness; and<br>nothing could be distinguished. And other evil omens besides these<br>appeared there. Witnessing these strange phenomena, Dharma's son<br>Yudhishthira, the foremost of speakers, said, 'Who is it that will<br>overcome us? Ye Pandavas who take delight in battle, good betide you! Do<br>ye equip yourselves. From what I see, I infer that the time for the<br>display of our prowess hath drawn nigh'. Having said this, the king<br>looked around. Then not finding Bhima, that represser of foes, Dharma's<br>son, Yudhishthira, enquired of Krishna and the twins standing near<br>regarding his brother, Bhima, the doer of dreadful deeds in battle,<br>saying, 'O Panchali, is Bhima intent upon performing some great feat, or<br>hath that one delighting in daring deeds already achieved some brave<br>deed? Portending some great danger, these omens have appeared all around,<br>indicating a fearful battle.' When Yudhishthira said this, his beloved<br>queen, the high-minded Krishna of sweet smiles, answered him, in order to<br>remove his anxiety. 'O king, that Saugandhika lotus which to-day had been<br>brought by the wind. I had out of love duly shown unto Bhimasena; and I<br>had also said unto that hero, If thou canst find many of this species,<br>procuring even all of them, do thou return speedily,&#8212;O Pandava, that<br>mighty armed one, with the view of gratifying my desire, may have gone<br>towards the north-east to bring them.' Having heard these words of hers,<br>the king said unto twins, 'Let us together follow the path taken by<br>Vrikodara. Let the Rakshasas carry those Brahmanas that are fatigued and<br>weak. O Ghatotkacha, O thou like unto a celestial, do thou carry Krishna.<br>I am convinced and it is plain that Bhima hath dived into the forest; for<br>it is long since he hath gone, and in speed he resembleth the wind, and<br>in clearing over the ground, he is swift like unto Vinata's son, and he<br>will ever leap into the sky, and alight at his will. O Rakshasas, we<br>shall follow him through your prowess. He will not at first do any wrong<br>to the Siddhas versed in the Vedas. O best of the Bharatas, saying, 'So<br>be it,' Hidimava's son and the other Rakshasas who knew the quarter where<br>the lotus lake of Kuvera was situated, started cheerfully with Lomasa,<br>bearing the Pandavas, and many of the Brahmanas. Having shortly reached<br>that spot, they saw that romantic lake covered with Saugandhika and other<br>lotuses and surrounded by beautiful woods. And on its shores they beheld<br>the high-souled and vehement Bhima, as also the slaughtered Yakshas of<br>large eyes, with their bodies, eyes, arms and thighs smashed, and their<br>heads crushed. And on seeing the high-souled Bhima, standing on the shore<br>of that lake in an angry mood, and with steadfast eyes, and biting his<br>lip, and stationed on the shore of the lake with his mace upraised by his<br>two hands, like unto Yama with his mace in his hand at the time of the<br>universal dissolution. Yudhishthira the just, embraced him again and<br>again, and said in sweet words, 'O Kaunteya, what hast thou done? Good<br>betide thee! If thou wishest to do good unto me, thou shouldst never<br>again commit such a rash act, nor offend the gods.' Having thus<br>instructed the son of Kunti, and taken the flowers those god-like ones<br>began to sport in that very lake. At this instant, the huge-bodied<br>warders of the gardens, equipped with rocks for weapons, presented<br>themselves at the spot. And seeing Yudhishthira the just and the great<br>sage Lomasa and Nakula and Sahadeva and also the other foremost of<br>Brahmanas, they all bowed themselves down in humility. And being pacified<br>by Yudhishthira the just, the Rakshasas became satisfied. And with the<br>knowledge of Kuvera, those foremost of Kurus for a short time dwelt<br>pleasantly at that spot on the slopes of the Gandhamadana, expecting<br>Arjuna."
