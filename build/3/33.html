                            'Vaisampayana said, "Hearing these words of Yajnaseni, Bhimasena, sighing<br>in wrath, approached the king and addressed him, saying, 'Walk, O<br>monarch, in the customary path trodden by good men, (before thee) in<br>respect of kingdoms. What do we gain by living in the asylum of ascetics,<br>thus deprived of virtue, pleasure, and profit? It is not by virtue, nor<br>by honesty, nor by might, but by unfair dice, that our kingdom hath been<br>snatched by Duryodhana. Like a weak offal-eating jackal snatching the<br>prey from mighty lions, he hath snatched away our kingdom. Why, O<br>monarch, in obedience to the trite merit of sticking to a promise, dost<br>thou suffer such distress, abandoning that wealth which is the source of<br>both virtue and enjoyments? It was for thy carelessness, O king, that our<br>kingdom protected by the wielder of the Gandiva and therefore, incapable<br>of being wrested by Indra himself, was snatched from us in our very<br>sight. It was for thee, O monarch, that, ourselves living, our prosperity<br>was snatched away from us like a fruit from one unable to use his arms,<br>or like kine from one incapable of using his legs. Thou art faithful in<br>the acquisition of virtue. It was to please thee, O Bharata, that we have<br>suffered ourselves to be overwhelmed with such dire calamity. O bull of<br>the Bharata race, it was because we were subject to thy control that we<br>are thus tearing the hearts of our friends and gratifying our foes. That<br>we did not, in obedience to thee, even then slay the sons of<br>Dhritarashtra, is an act of folly on our part that grieveth me sorely.<br>This thy abode, O king, in the woods, like that of any wild animal, is<br>what a man of weakness alone would submit to. Surely, no man of might<br>would ever lead such a life. This thy course of life is approved neither<br>by Krishna, nor Vibhatsu, nor by Abhimanyu, nor by the Srinjayas, nor by<br>myself, nor by the sons of Madri. Afflicted with the vows, thy cry is<br>Religion! Religion! Hast thou from despair been deprived of thy<br>manliness? Cowards alone, unable to win back their prosperity, cherish<br>despair, which is fruitless and destructive of one's purposes. Thou hast<br>ability and eyes. Thou seest that manliness dwelleth in us. It is because<br>thou hast adopted a life of peace that thou feelest not this distress.<br>These Dhritarashtras regard us who are forgiving, as really incompetent.<br>This, O king, grieveth me more than death in battle. If we all die in<br>fair fight without turning our backs on the foe, even that would be<br>better than this exile, for then we should obtain regions of bliss in the<br>other world. Or, if, O bull of the Bharata race, having slain them all,<br>we acquire the entire earth, that would be prosperity worth the trial. We<br>who ever adhere to the customs of our order, who ever desire grand<br>achievements, who wish to avenge our wrongs, have this for our bounden<br>duty. Our kingdom wrested from us, if we engage in battle, our deeds when<br>known to the world will procure for us fame and not slander. And that<br>virtue, O king, which tortureth one's own self and friends, is really no<br>virtue. It is rather vice, producing calamities. Virtue is sometimes also<br>the weakness of men. And though such a man might ever be engaged in the<br>practice of virtue, yet both virtue and profit forsake him, like pleasure<br>and pain forsaking a person that is dead. He that practiseth virtue for<br>virtue's sake always suffereth. He can scarcely be called a wise man, for<br>he knoweth not the purposes of virtue like a blind man incapable of<br>perceiving the solar light. He that regardeth his wealth to exist for<br>himself alone, scarcely understandeth the purposes of wealth. He is<br>really like a servant that tendeth kine in a forest. He again that<br>pursueth wealth too much without pursuing virtue and enjoyments,<br>deserveth to be censured and slain by all men. He also that ever pursueth<br>enjoyments without pursuing virtue and wealth, loseth his friends and<br>virtue and wealth also. Destitute of virtue and wealth such a man,<br>indulging in pleasure at will, at the expiration of his period of<br>indulgence, meeteth with certain death, like a fish when the water in<br>which it liveth hath been dried up. It is for these reasons that they<br>that are wise are ever careful of both virtue and wealth, for a union of<br>virtue and wealth is the essential requisite of pleasure, as fuel is the<br>essential requisite of fire. Pleasure hath always virtue for its root,<br>and virtue also is united with pleasure. Know, O monarch, that both are<br>dependent on each other like the ocean and the clouds, the ocean causing<br>the clouds and the clouds filling the ocean. The joy that one feeleth in<br>consequence of contact with objects of touch or of possession of wealth,<br>is what is called pleasure. It existeth in the mind, having no corporeal<br>existence that one can see. He that wisheth (to obtain) wealth, seeketh<br>for a large share of virtue to crown his wish with success. He that<br>wisheth for pleasure, seeketh wealth, (so that his wish may be realised).<br>Pleasure however, yieldeth nothing in its turn. One pleasure cannot lead<br>to another, being its own fruit, as ashes may be had from wood, but<br>nothing from those ashes in their turn. And, O king, as a fowler killeth<br>the birds we see, so doth sin slay the creatures of the world. He,<br>therefore, who misled by pleasure or covetousness, beholdeth not the<br>nature of virtue, deserveth to be slain by all, and becometh wretched<br>both here and here-after. It is evident, O king, that thou knowest that<br>pleasure may be derived from the possession of various objects of<br>enjoyment. Thou also well knowest their ordinary states, as well as the<br>great changes they undergo. At their loss or disappearance occasioned by<br>decrepitude or death, ariseth what is called distress. That distress, O<br>king, hath now overtaken us. The joy that ariseth from the five senses,<br>the intellect and the heart, being directed to the objects proper to<br>each, is called pleasure. That pleasure, O king, is, as I think, one of<br>the best fruits of our actions.<br><br>"Thus, O monarch, one should regard virtue, wealth and pleasure one after<br>another. One should not devote one self to virtue alone, nor regard<br>wealth as the highest object of one's wishes, nor pleasure, but should<br>ever pursue all three. The scriptures ordain that one should seek virtue<br>in the morning, wealth at noon, and pleasure in the evening. The<br>scriptures also ordain that one should seek pleasure in the first portion<br>of life, wealth in the second, and virtue in the last. And, O thou<br>foremost of speakers, they that are wise and fully conversant with proper<br>division of time, pursue all three, virtue, wealth, and pleasure,<br>dividing their time duly. O son of the Kuru race, whether independence of<br>these (three), or their possession is the better for those that desire<br>happiness, should be settled by thee after careful thought. And thou<br>shouldst then, O king, unhesitatingly act either for acquiring them, or<br>abandoning them all. For he who liveth wavering between the two<br>doubtingly, leadeth a wretched life. It is well known that thy behaviour<br>is ever regulated by virtue. Knowing this thy friends counsel thee to<br>act. Gift, sacrifice, respect for the wise, study of the Vedas, and<br>honesty, these, O king, constitute the highest virtue and are efficacious<br>both here and hereafter. These virtues, however, cannot be attained by<br>one that hath no wealth, even if, O tiger among men, he may have infinite<br>other accomplishments. The whole universe, O king, dependeth upon virtue.<br>There is nothing higher than virtue. And virtue, O king, is attainable by<br>one that hath plenty of wealth. Wealth cannot be earned by leading a<br>mendicant life, nor by a life of feebleness. Wealth, however, can be<br>earned by intelligence directed by virtue. In thy case, O king, begging,<br>which is successful with Brahmanas, hath been forbidden. Therefore, O<br>bull amongst men, strive for the acquisition of wealth by exerting thy<br>might and energy. Neither mendicancy, nor the life of a Sudra is what is<br>proper for thee. Might and energy constitute the virtue of the Kshatriya<br>in especial. Adopt thou, therefore, the virtue of thy order and slay the<br>enemies. Destroy the might of Dhritarashtra's sons, O son of Pritha, with<br>my and Arjuna's aid. They that are learned and wise say that sovereignty<br>is virtue. Acquire sovereignty, therefore, for it behoveth thee not to<br>live in a state of inferiority. Awake, O king, and understand the eternal<br>virtues (of the order). By birth thou belongest to an order whose deeds<br>are cruel and are a source of pain to man. Cherish thy subjects and reap<br>the fruit thereof. That can never be a reproach. Even this, O king, is<br>the virtue ordained by God himself for the order to which thou belongest!<br>If thou tallest away therefrom, thou wilt make thyself ridiculous.<br>Deviation from the virtues of one's own order is never applauded.<br>Therefore, O thou of the Kuru race, making thy heart what it ought to be,<br>agreeably to the order to which thou belongest, and casting away this<br>course of feebleness, summon thy energy and bear thy weight like one that<br>beareth it manfully. No king, O monarch, could ever acquire the<br>sovereignty of the earth or prosperity or affluence by means of virtue<br>alone. Like a fowler earning his food in the shape of swarms of little<br>easily-tempted game, by offering them some attractive food, doth one that<br>is intelligent acquire a kingdom, by offering bribes unto low and<br>covetous enemies. Behold, O bull among kings, the Asuras, though elder<br>brothers in possession of power and affluence, were all vanquished by the<br>gods through stratagem. Thus, O king, everything belongeth to those that<br>are mighty. And, O mighty-armed one, slay thy foes, having recourse to<br>stratagem. There is none equal unto Arjuna in wielding the bow in battle.<br>Nor is there anybody that may be equal unto me in wielding the mace.<br>Strong men, O monarch, engage in battle depending on their might, and not<br>on the force of numbers nor on information of the enemy's plans procured<br>through spies. Therefore, O son of Pandu exert thy might. Might is the<br>root of wealth. Whatever else is said to be its root is really not such.<br>As the shade of the tree in winter goeth for nothing, so without might<br>everything else becometh fruitless. Wealth should be spent by one who<br>wisheth to increase his wealth, after the manner, O son of Kunti, of<br>scattering seeds on the ground. Let there be no doubt then in thy mind.<br>Where, however, wealth that is more or even equal is not to be gained,<br>there should be no expenditure of wealth. For investment of wealth are<br>like the ass, scratching, pleasurable at first but painful afterwards.<br>Thus, O king of men, the person who throweth away like seeds a little of<br>his virtue in order to gain a larger measure of virtue, is regarded as<br>wise. Beyond doubt, it is as I say. They that are wise alienate the<br>friends of the foe that owneth such, and having weakened him by causing<br>those friends to abandon him thus, they then reduce him to subjection.<br>Even they that are strong, engage in battle depending on their courage.<br>One cannot by even continued efforts (uninspired by courage) or by the<br>arts of conciliation, always conquer a kingdom. Sometimes, O king, men<br>that are weak, uniting in large numbers, slay even a powerful foe, like<br>bees killing the despoiler of the honey by force of numbers alone. (As<br>regards thyself), O king, like the sun that sustaineth as well as slayeth<br>creatures by his rays, adopt thou the ways of the sun. To protect one's<br>kingdom and cherish the people duly, as done by our ancestors, O king,<br>is, it hath been heard by us, a kind of asceticism mentioned even in the<br>Vedas. By ascetism, O king, a Kshatriya cannot acquire such regions of<br>blessedness as he can by fair fight whether ending in victory or defeat.<br>Beholding, O king, this thy distress, the world hath come to the<br>conclusion that light may forsake the Sun and grace the Moon. And, O<br>king, good men separately as well as assembling together, converse with<br>one another, applauding thee and blaming the other. There is this,<br>moreover, O monarch, viz., that both the Kurus and the Brahmanas,<br>assembling together, gladly speak of thy firm adherence to truth, in that<br>thou hast never, from ignorance, from meanness, from covetousness, or<br>from fear, uttered an untruth. Whatever sin, O monarch, a king committeth<br>in acquiring dominion, he consumeth it all afterwards by means of<br>sacrifices distinguished by large gifts. Like the Moon emerging from the<br>clouds, the king is purified from all sins by bestowing villages on<br>Brahmanas and kine by thousands. Almost all the citizens as well as the<br>inhabitants of the country, young or old, O son of the Kuru race, praise<br>thee, O Yudhishthira! This also, O Bharata, the people are saying amongst<br>themselves, viz., that as milk in a bag of dog's hide, as the Vedas in a<br>Sudra, as truth in a robber, as strength in a woman, so is sovereignty in<br>Duryodhana. Even women and children are repeating this, as if it were a<br>lesson they seek to commit to memory. O represser of foes, thou hast<br>fallen into this state along with ourselves. Alas, we also are lost with<br>thee for this calamity of thine. Therefore, ascending in thy car<br>furnished with every implement, and making the superior Brahmanas utter<br>benedictions on thee, march thou with speed, even this very day, upon<br>Hastinapura, in order that thou mayst be able to give unto Brahmanas the<br>spoils of victory. Surrounded by thy brothers, who are firm wielders of<br>the bow, and by heroes skilled in weapons and like unto snakes of<br>virulent poison, set thou out even like the slayer Vritra surounded by<br>the Marutas. And, O son of Kunti, as thou art powerful, grind thou with<br>thy might thy weak enemies, like Indra grinding the Asuras; and snatch<br>thou from Dhritarashtra's son the prosperity he enjoyeth. There is no<br>mortal that can bear the touch of the shafts furnished with the feathers<br>of the vulture and resembling snakes of virulent poison, that would be<br>shot from the Gandiva. And, O Bharata, there is not a warrior, nor an<br>elephant, nor a horse, that is able to bear the impetus of my mace when I<br>am angry in battle. Why, O son of Kunti, should we not wrest our kingdom<br>from the foe, fighting with the aid of the Srinjayas and Kaikeyas, and<br>the bull of the Vrishni race? Why, O king, should we not succeed in<br>wresting the (sovereignty of the) earth that is now in the hands of the<br>foe, if, aided by a large force, we do but strive?"
