                            Vaisampayana continued, "Then, O represser of foes, at sunrise, having<br>finished his daily devotions, Dhaumya came unto the Pandavas, with<br>Arshtishena. And having bowed down unto the feet of Arshtishena and<br>Dhaumya, they with joined hands paid homage unto all the Brahmanas. Then<br>Dhaumya taking Yudhishthira's right hand, said these words, looking at<br>the east, 'O mighty monarch, this king of mountains, Mandara lieth vast,<br>covering the earth up to the ocean. O Pandava, Indra and Vaisravana<br>preside over this point graced with woods and forests and mountains. And,<br>O child, the intelligent sages versed in every duty, say, that this<br>(region) is the abode of Indra and king Vaisravana. And the twice-born<br>ones, and the sages versed in the duties, and the Sidhas, and the<br>Sadhyas, and the celestials pay their adorations unto the Sun as he<br>riseth from this point. And that lord of all living beings, king Yama,<br>conversant with duty, presideth over yonder southern region whither come<br>the spirits of the departed. And this is Sanyamana, the abode of the lord<br>of departed spirits, sacred, and wonderful to behold, and crowned with<br>prime prosperity. And the intelligent ones call that monarch of mountains<br>(by the name of) Asta. Having, O king, arrived at this, the Sun ever<br>abideth by the truth. And king Varuna protects all creatures, abiding in<br>this king of mountains, and also in the vast deep. And, O highly<br>fortunate one, there illumining the northern regions, lieth the puissant<br>Mahameru, auspicious and the refuge of those knowing Brahma, where is the<br>court of Brahma, and remaining where that soul of all creatures,<br>Prajapati, hath created all that is mobile and immobile. And the Mahameru<br>is the auspicious and healthy abode even of the seven mind-born sons of<br>Brahma, of whom Daksha was the seventh. And, O child, here it is that the<br>seven celestial rishis with Vasishtha at their head rise and set. Behold<br>that excellent and bright summit of the Meru, where sitteth the great<br>sire (Brahma) with the celestials happy in self-knowledge. And next to<br>the abode of Brahma is visible the region of him who is said to be the<br>really primal Cause or the origin of all creatures, even that prime lord,<br>god Narayana, having neither beginning nor end. And, O king, that<br>auspicious place composed of all energies even the celestials, cannot<br>behold. And the region of the high-souled Vishnu, by its native<br>splendour, exceeding in effulgence the sun or fire, cannot be beheld by<br>the gods, or the Danavas. And the region of Narayana lieth resplendent to<br>the east of the Meru, where, O child, that lord of all creatures, the<br>self-create primal Cause of the universe, having manifested all beings,<br>looketh splendid of his excellent grace. O child, not to speak of the<br>Maharshis&#8212;even Brahmarshis have no access to that place. And, O best of<br>the Kurus, it is the Yatis only who have access to it. And, O Pandu's<br>son, (at that place) luminaries cannot shine by him; there that lord of<br>inconceivable soul alone shineth transcendental. There by reverence, and<br>severe austerities, Yatis inspired by virtue of pious practices, attain<br>Narayana Hari. And, O Bharata, repairing thither, and attaining that<br>universal Soul&#8212;the self-create and eternal God of gods, high-souled<br>ones, of Yoga success, and free from ignorance and pride have not to<br>return to this world. O highly fortunate Yudhishthira, this region is<br>without beginning, or deterioration, or end for it is the very essence of<br>that God. And, O son of the Kurus, the Sun and the Moon every day go<br>round this Meru, coursing in an opposite direction. And, O sinless one. O<br>mighty monarch, the other luminaries also go round this king of mountains<br>in the self-same way. Thus the worshipful Sun who dispelleth darkness,<br>goeth round this (mountain) obscuring other luminaries. Then having set,<br>and passed the evening, that Maker of day, the Sun, taketh a northerly<br>course. Then again nearing the Meru, the divine Sun (ever) intent on the<br>good of all beings, again courseth, facing the east. And in this way, the<br>divine Moon also together with the stars goeth round this mountain,<br>dividing the month unto several sections, by his arrival at the Parvas.<br>Having thus unerringly coursed round the mighty Meru, and, nourished all<br>creatures, the Moon again repaireth unto the Mandar. In the same way,<br>that destroyer of darkness&#8212;the divine Sun&#8212;also moveth on this<br>unobstructed path, animating the universe. When, desirous of causing dew,<br>he repaireth to the south, then there ensueth winter to all creatures.<br>Then the Sun, turning back from the south, by his rays draweth up the<br>energy from all creatures both mobile and immobile. Thereupon, men become<br>subject to perspiration, fatigue, drowsiness and lassitude; and living<br>beings always feel disposed to slumber. Thence, returning through unknown<br>regions, that divine effulgent one causeth shower, and thereby reviveth<br>beings. And having, by the comfort caused by the shower, wind, and<br>warmth, cherished the mobile and the immobile, the powerful Sun resumeth<br>his former course. O Partha, ranging thus, the Sun unerringly turneth on<br>the wheel of Time, influencing created things. His course is unceasing;<br>he never resteth, O Pandava. Withdrawing the energy of all beings, he<br>again rendereth it back. O Bharata, dividing time into day and night, and<br>Kala, and Kashtha, that lord, the Sun, dealeth life and motion to all<br>created things.'"
