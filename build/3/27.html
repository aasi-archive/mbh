                            Vaisampayana said, "Exiled to the woods the sons of Pritha with Krishna<br>seated in the evening, conversed with one another afflicted with sorrow<br>and grief. And the handsome and well informed Krishna dear unto her lords<br>and devoted to them, thus spake unto Yudhishthira, Then sinful, cruel,<br>and wicked-minded son of Dhritarashtra certainly feeleth no sorrow for<br>us, when, O king, that evil-hearted wretch having sent thee with myself<br>into the woods dressed in deer-skin feeleth no regret! The heart of that<br>wretch of evil deeds must surely be made of steel when he could at that<br>time address thee, his virtuous eldest brother, in words so harsh! Having<br>brought thee who deservest to enjoy every happiness and never such woe,<br>into such distress, alas, that wicked-minded and sinful wretch joyeth<br>with his friends! O Bharata, when dressed in deer-skin thou hast set out<br>for the woods, only four persons, O monarch, viz., Duryodhana, Karna, the<br>evil-minded Sakuni, and Dussasana that bad and fierce brother of<br>Duryodhana, did not shed tears! With the exception of these, O thou best<br>of the Kurus, all other Kurus filled with sorrow shed tears from their<br>eyes! Beholding this thy bed and recollecting what thou hadst before, I<br>grieve, O king, for thee who deservest not woe and hast been brought up<br>in every luxury! Remembering that seat of ivory in thy court, decked with<br>jewels and beholding this seat of kusa grass, grief consumeth me, O king!<br>I saw thee, O king, surrounded in thy court by kings! What peace can my<br>heart know in not beholding thee such now? I beheld thy body, effulgent<br>as the sun, decked with sandal paste! Alas, grief depriveth me of my<br>senses in beholding thee now besmeared with mud and dirt! I saw thee<br>before, O king, dressed in silken clothes of pure white! But I now behold<br>thee dressed in rags? Formerly, O king, pure food of every kind was<br>carried from thy house on plates of gold for Brahmanas by thousands! And,<br>O king, food also of the best kind was formerly given by thee unto<br>ascetics both houseless and living in domesticity! Formerly, living in<br>dry mansion thou hadst ever filled with food of every kind plates by<br>thousands, and worshipped the Brahmanas gratifying every wish of theirs!<br>What peace, O king, can my heart know in not beholding all this now? And,<br>O great king, these thy brothers, endued with youth and decked with<br>ear-rings, were formerly fed by cook with food of the sweet flavour and<br>dressed with skill! Alas, O king, I now behold them all, so undeserving<br>of woe, living in the woods and upon what the wood may yield! My heart, O<br>King knoweth no peace! Thinking of this Bhimasena living in sorrow in the<br>woods, doth not thy anger blaze up, even though it is time? Why doth not<br>thy anger, O king, blaze up upon beholding the illustrious Bhimasena who<br>ever performeth everything unaided, so fallen into distress, though<br>deserving of every happiness? Why, O king, doth not thy anger blaze up on<br>beholding that Bhima living in the woods who was formerly surrounded with<br>numerous vehicles and dressed in costly apparel? This exalted personage<br>is ready to slay all the Kurus in battle. He beareth, however, all this<br>sorrow, only because he waiteth for the fufilment of thy promise! This<br>Arjuna, O king, though possessed of two hands, is equal, for the<br>lightness of his hand in discharging shafts, to (Kartavirya) Arjuna of a<br>thousand arms! He Is even (to foes), like unto Yama himself at the end of<br>the Yuga! It was by the prowess of his weapons that all the kings of the<br>earth were made to wait upon the Brahmanas at thy sacrifice? Beholding<br>that Arjuna that tiger among men worshipped by both the celestials and<br>the Danavas so anxious, why, O king, dost thou not feel indignant? I<br>grieve, O Bharata, that thy wrath doth not blaze up at sight of that son<br>of Pritha in exile, that prince who deserveth not such distress and who<br>hath been brought up in every luxury! Why doth not thy wrath blaze up at<br>sight of that Arjuna in exile, who, on a single car, hath vanquished<br>celestials and men and serpents? Why, O king, doth not thy wrath blaze up<br>at sight of that Arjuna in exile who, honoured with offerings of cars and<br>vehicles of various forms and horses and elephants, forcibly took from<br>the kings of the earth their treasures, who is the chastiser of all foes,<br>and who at one impetus can throw full five hundred arrows? Why, O king,<br>doth not thy wrath blaze up at sight of Nakula, in exile, who so fair and<br>able-bodied and young, is the foremost of all swordsmen? Why, O king,<br>dost thou pardon the foe. O Yudhishthira, at sight of Madri's son, the<br>handsome and brave Sahadeva in exile? Why doth not thy anger blaze up, O<br>king, it sight of both Nakula and Sahadeva overwhelmed with grief, though<br>so undeserving of distress? Why also, O king, dost thou pardon the foe at<br>sight of myself in exile who, born in the race of Drupada and, therefore,<br>the sister of Dhrishtadyumna, am the daughter-in-law of the illustrious<br>Pandu and the devoted wife of heroes? Truly, O thou best of the Bharatas,<br>thou hast no anger, else why is it that thy mind is not moved at sight of<br>thy brothers and myself (in such distress)? It is said that there is no<br>Kshatriya in the world who is bereft of anger. I now behold in thee,<br>however, a refutation of the proverb! That Kshatriya, O son of Pritha,<br>who discovereth not his energy when the opportunity cometh, is ever<br>disregarded by all creatures! Therefore, O king, thou shouldst not extend<br>thy forgiveness to the foe. Indeed, with thy energy, without doubt, thou,<br>mayst slay them all! So also, O king, that Kshatriya who is not appeased<br>when the time for forgiveness cometh, becometh unpopular with every<br>creature and meeteth with destruction both in this and the other world!'"
