                            (Aranyaka Parva)<br><br>Om! Having bowed down to Narayana, and Nara the foremost of male beings,<br>and the goddess Saraswati also, must the word Jaya be uttered.<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'O thou foremost of regenerate ones, deceitfully<br>defeated at dice by the sons of Dhritarashtra and their counsellors,<br>incensed by those wicked ones that thus brought about a fierce animosity,<br>and addressed in language that was so cruel, what did the Kuru princes,<br>my ancestors&#8212;the sons of Pritha&#8212;(then) do? How also did the sons of<br>Pritha, equal unto Sakra in prowess, deprived of affluence and suddenly<br>over whelmed with misery, pass their days in the forest? Who followed the<br>steps of those princes plunged in excess of affliction? And how did those<br>high souled ones bear themselves and derive their sustenance, and where<br>did they put up? And, O illustrious ascetic and foremost of Brahmanas,<br>how did those twelve years (of exile) of those warriors who were slayers<br>of foes, pass away in the forest? And undeserving of pain, how did that<br>princess, the best of her sex, devoted to her husbands, eminently<br>virtuous, and always speaking the truth, endure that painful exile in the<br>forest? O thou of ascetic wealth tell me all this in detail, for, O<br>Brahmana, I desire to hear thee narrate the history of those heroes<br>possessed of abundant prowess and lustre. Truly my curiosity is great.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus defeated at dice and incensed by the wicked<br>sons of Dhritarashtra and their counsellors, the sons of Pritha set out<br>from Hastinapura. And issuing through Vardhamana gate of the city, the<br>Pandavas bearing their weapons and accompanied by Draupadi set out in a<br>northernly direction. Indrasena and others, with servants numbering<br>altogether fourteen, with their wives, followed them on swift cars. And<br>the citizens learning of their departure became overwhelmed with sorrow,<br>and began to censure Bhishma and Vidura and Drona and Gautama. And having<br>met together they thus addressed one another fearlessly.<br><br>'Alas, our families, we ourselves, and our homes are all gone, when the<br>wicked Duryodhana, backed by the son of Suvala, by Karna and Dussasana,<br>aspireth to this kingdom. And, Oh, our families, our (ancestral) usages,<br>our virtue and prosperity, are all doomed where this sinful wretch<br>supported by wretches as sinful aspireth to the kingdom! And, Oh, how can<br>happiness be there where these are not! Duryodhana beareth malice towards<br>all superiors, hath taken leave of good conduct, and quarreleth with<br>those that are near to him in blood. Covetous and vain and mean, he is<br>cruel by nature. The whole earth is doomed when Duryodhana becometh its<br>ruler. Thither, therefore, let us proceed whither the merciful and<br>high-minded sons of Pandu with passions under control and victorious over<br>foes, and possessed of modesty and renown, and devoted to pious<br>practices, repair!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'And saying this, the citizens went after the<br>Pandavas, and having met them, they all, with joined hands, thus<br>addressed the sons of Kunti and Madri.<br><br>'Blest be ye! Where will ye go, leaving us in grief? We will follow you<br>whithersoever ye will go! Surely have we been distressed upon learning<br>that ye have been deceitfully vanquished by relentless enemies! It<br>behoveth you not to forsake us that are your loving subjects and devoted<br>friends always seeking your welfare and employed in doing what is<br>agreeable to you! We desire not to be overwhelmed in certain destruction<br>living in the dominions of the Kuru king. Ye bulls among men, listen as<br>we indicate the merits and demerits springing respectively from<br>association with what is good and bad! As cloth, water, the ground, and<br>sesame seeds are perfumed by association with flowers, even so are<br>qualities ever the product of association. Verily association with fools<br>produceth an illusion that entangleth the mind, as daily communion with<br>the good and the wise leadeth to the practice of virtue. Therefore, they<br>that desire emancipation should associate with those that are wise and<br>old and honest and pure in conduct and possessed of ascetic merit. They<br>should be waited upon whose triple possessions, viz., knowledge (of the<br>Vedas), origin and acts, are all pure, and association with them is even<br>superior to (the study of the) scriptures. Devoid of the religious acts<br>as we are, we shall yet reap religious merit by association with the<br>righteous, as we should come by sin by waiting upon the sinful. The very<br>sight and touch of the dishonest, and converse and association with them;<br>cause diminution of virtue, and men (that are doomed to these), never<br>attain purity of mind. Association with the base impaireth the<br>understanding, as, indeed, with the indifferent maketh it indifferent,<br>while communion with the good ever exalteth it. All those attributes<br>which are spoken of in the world as the sources of religious merit, of<br>worldly prosperity and sensual pleasures, which are regarded by the<br>people, extolled in the Vedas, and approved by the well-behaved, exist in<br>you, separately and jointly! Therefore, desirous of our own welfare, we<br>wish to live amongst you who possess those attributes!<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Blessed are we since the people with the Brahmanas<br>at their head, moved by affection and compassion credit us with merits we<br>have not. I, however, with my brothers, would ask all of you to do one<br>thing. Ye should not, through affection and pity for us, act otherwise!<br>Our grandfather Bhishma, the king (Dhritarashtra), Vidura, my mother and<br>most of my well-wishers, are all in the city of Hastinapura. Therefore,<br>if ye are minded to seek our welfare, cherish ye them with care, uniting<br>together as they are overwhelmed with sorrow and afflictions. Grieved at<br>our departure, ye have come far! Go ye back, and let your hearts be<br>directed with tenderness towards the relatives I entrust to you as<br>pledges! This, of all others, is the one act upon which my heart is set,<br>and by doing this ye would give me great satisfaction and pay me your<br>best regards!<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus exhorted by Yudhishthira the just, the<br>people in a body set up a loud wail exclaiming,&#8212;Alas, O king! And<br>afflicted and overwhelmed with sorrow on remembering the virtues of<br>Pritha's son, they unwillingly retraced their steps asking leave of the<br>Pandavas.<br><br>'The citizens having ceased to follow, the Pandavas ascended their cars,<br>and setting out reached (the site of) the mighty banian tree called<br>Pramana on the banks of the Ganges. And reaching the site of the banian<br>tree about the close of the day, the heroic sons of Pandu purified<br>themselves by touching the sacred water, and passed the night there. And<br>afflicted with woe they spent that night taking water alone as their sole<br>sustenance. Certain Brahmanas belonging to both classes, viz., those that<br>maintained the sacrificial fire and those that maintained it not, who<br>had, with their disciples and relatives, out of affection followed the<br>Pandavas thither also passed the night with them. And surrounded by those<br>utterers of Brahma, the king shone resplendent in their midst. And that<br>evening, at once beautiful and terrible, those Brahmanas having lighted<br>their (sacred) fires, began to chant the Vedas and hold mutual converse.<br>And those foremost of Brahmanas, with swan-sweet voices spent the night,<br>comforting that best of Kurus&#8212;the king."
