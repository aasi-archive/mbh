                            "Markandeya said, 'Then the Brahmarshis, the Siddhas and the Devarshis,<br>with Havyavaha as their spokesman, sought the protection of Brahma. And<br>Agni said, 'That powerful son of Visrava, the Ten-headed cannot be slain<br>on account of thy boon! Endued with great might he oppresseth in every<br>possible way the creatures of the earth. Protect us, therefore, O<br>adorable one! There is none else save thee to protect us!'<br><br>"Brahma said, 'O Agni, he cannot be conquered in battle by either the<br>gods or the Asuras! I have already ordained that which is needful for<br>that purpose. Indeed his death is near! Urged by me, the four-headed God<br>hath already been incarnate for that object. Even Vishnu, that foremost<br>of smiters will achieve that object!'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Then the Grandsire also asked Sakra, in their<br>presence, 'Be thou, with all the celestials, born on earth! And beget ye<br>on monkeys and bears, heroic sons possessed of great strength and capable<br>of assuming any form at will as allies of Vishnu!' And at this, the gods,<br>the Gandharvas and the Danavas quickly assembled to take counsel as to<br>how they should be born on earth according to their respective parts. And<br>in their presence the boon-giving god commanded a Gandharvi, by name<br>Dundubhi saying, 'Go there for accomplishing this object!' And Dundubhi<br>hearing these words of the Grandsire was born in the world of men as the<br>hunchbacked Manthara. And all the principal celestials, with Sakra and<br>others begot offspring upon the wives of the foremost of monkeys and<br>bears. And those sons equalled their sires in strength and fame. And they<br>were capable of splitting mountain peaks and their weapons were stones<br>and trees of the Sala and the Tala species. And their bodies were hard as<br>adamant, and they were possessed of very great strength. And they were<br>all skilled in war and capable of mustering any measure of energy at<br>will. And they were equal to a thousand elephants in might, and they<br>resembled the wind in speed. And some of them lived wherever they liked,<br>while others lived in forests. And the adorable Creator of the Universe,<br>having ordained all this, instructed Manthara as to what she would have<br>to do. And Manthara quick as thought, understood all his words, and went<br>hither and thither ever engaged in fomenting quarrels."
