                            "Arjuna continued, 'Remaining invisible the Daityas began to fight with<br>the help of illusion. And I too fought with them, resorting to the energy<br>of visible weapons. And the shafts duly discharged from the Gandiva,<br>began to sever their heads at those different places where they were<br>respectively stationed. And thus assailed by me in the conflict, the<br>Nivata-Kavachas, all on a sudden withdrawing the illusion, entered into<br>their own city. And when the Daityas had fled, and when all had become<br>visible, I there discovered hundreds and thousands of the slain. And<br>there I saw by hundreds their shivered weapons, ornaments, limbs, and<br>mail. And the horses could not find room for moving from one place to<br>another; and on a sudden with a bound, they fell to coursing in the sky.<br>Then remaining invisible, the Nivata-Kavachas covered the entire welkin<br>with masses of crags. And, O Bharata, other dreadful Danavas, entering<br>into the entrails of the earth, took up horses' legs and chariot-wheels.<br>And as I was fighting, they, hard besetting my horses with rocks,<br>attacked me together with (my) car. And with the crags that had fallen<br>and with others that were falling, the place where I was, seemed to be a<br>mountain cavern. And on myself being covered with crags and on the horses<br>being hard pressed, I became sore distressed and this was marked by<br>Matali. And on seeing me afraid, he said unto me, 'O Arjuna, Arjuna! be<br>thou not afraid; send that weapon, the thunder-bolt, O lord of men.'<br>Hearing those words of his, I then discharged the favourite weapon of the<br>king of the celestials&#8212;the dreadful thunderbolt. And inspiring the<br>Gandiva with mantras, I, aiming at the locality of the crags, shot<br>sharpened iron shafts of the touch of the thunder-bolt. And sent by the<br>thunder, those adamantine arrows entered into all those illusions and<br>into the midst of those Nivata-Kavachas. And slaughtered by the vehemence<br>of the thunder, those Danavas resembling cliffs, fell to the earth<br>together in masses. And entering amongst those Danavas that had carried<br>away the steeds of the car into the interior of the earth, the shafts<br>sent them into the mansion of Yama. And that quarter was completely<br>covered with the Nivata-Kavachas that had been killed or baffled,<br>comparable unto cliffs and lying scattered like crags. And then no injury<br>appeared to have been sustained either by the horses, or by the car, or<br>by Matali, or by me, and this seemed strange. Then, O king, Matali<br>addressed me smiling, 'Not in the celestials themselves, O Arjuna, is<br>seen the prowess that is seen in thee. And when the Danava hosts had been<br>destroyed, all their females began to bewail in that city, like unto<br>cranes in autumn. Then with Matali I entered that city, terrifying with<br>the rattling of my car the wives of the Nivata-Kavachas. Thereupon,<br>seeing those ten thousand horses like unto peacocks (in hue), and also<br>that chariot resembling the sun, the women fled in swarms. And like unto<br>(the sounds of) rocks falling on a mountain, sounds arose of the<br>(falling) ornaments of the terrified dames. (At length), the<br>panic-stricken wives of the Daityas entered into their respective golden<br>places variegated with innumerable jewels.<br><br>'Beholding that excellent city, superior to the city of the celestials<br>themselves, I asked Matali, saying, 'Why do not the celestials reside in<br>such (a place)? Surely, this appeareth superior to the city of<br>Purandara.' Thereat, Matali said, 'In days of yore, O Partha, even this<br>was the city of our lord of the celestials. Afterwards the celestials<br>were driven from hence by the Nivata-Kavachas. Having performed the most<br>rigid austerities, they had gratified the Grand-father and had asked (and<br>obtained) the boons&#8212;namely, that they might reside here, and that they<br>might be free from danger in wars with the gods.' Then Sakra addressed<br>the self-create lord saying, 'Do thou, O lord, desirous of our own<br>welfare do what is proper.' Thereupon, O Bharata, in this matter the Lord<br>commanded (Indra), saying, 'O slayer of foes, in another body, even thou<br>shalt be (the destroyer of the Danavas).' Then, in order to slaughter<br>them, Sakra rendered unto thee those weapons. The gods had been unable to<br>slay these, who have been slain by thee. O Bharata, in the fullness of<br>time, hadst thou come hither, in order to destroy them and thou hast done<br>so. O foremost of men, with the object that the demons might be killed,<br>Mahendra had conferred on thee the excellent prime energy of these<br>weapons.'<br><br>"Arjuna continued, 'After having destroyed the Danavas, and also subdued<br>that city, with Matali I again went to that abode of the celestials.'"
