                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O great saint! I am desirous of hearing in detail<br>why it was that Vindhya, made senseless with wrath, suddenly began to<br>increase his bulk.'"<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'The sun between his rising and setting used to revolve<br>round that monarch of mountains&#8212;the great Meru of golden lustre. And<br>seeing this the mountain Vindhya spake to Surya saying, 'As thou every<br>day goest round Meru and honourest him by thy circumambulations, do thou<br>even the same by me, O maker of light!' Thus addressed, the sun replied<br>to the great mountain, saying, 'I do not of my own will honour this<br>mountain by my circumambulations. By those who have built this universe<br>hath that path been assigned to me.' Thus addressed the mountain suddenly<br>began to increase from wrath, desirous, O chastiser of foes, of<br>obstructing the path of the Sun and the Moon. And all the assembled gods<br>came to Vindhya, the mighty king of mountains, and tried to dissuade him<br>from his course. But he heeded not what they said. And then all the<br>assembled gods went to the saint, living in the hermitage, engaged in the<br>practice of austerities, and the very best of persons devoted to virtue;<br>and stated all that happened to Agastya, possessed of exceeding<br>marvellous power.<br><br>"The gods said, 'This king of hills, Vindhya, giving way to wrath, is<br>stopping the path of the Sun and the Moon, and also the course of the<br>stars. O foremost of Brahmanas! O thou great in gifts! excepting thyself,<br>there is none who can prevent him; therefore do thou make him desist.'<br>Hearing these words of the gods the Brahmana came to the mountain. And he<br>with his wife, having arrived there, came near Vindhya and spake to him,<br>saying, 'O thou best of mountains! I wish to have a path given to me by<br>thee, as, for some purpose, I shall have to go to the southern region.<br>Until my return, do thou wait for me. And when I have returned, O king of<br>mountains, thou mayst increase in bulk as much as thou pleasest.' And, O<br>slayer of foes! having made this compact with Vindhya up to the present<br>day Varuna's son doth not return from the southern region. Thus have I,<br>asked by thee, narrated to thee why Vindhya doth not increase in bulk, by<br>reason of the power of Agastya. Now, O king! hear how the Kalakeyas were<br>killed by the gods, after they had obtained their prayer from Agastya.<br><br>"Having heard the words of the gods, Agastya, the son of Mitra, and<br>Varuna, said, 'Wherefore are ye come? What boon do ye solicit from me?'<br>Thus addressed by him, the deities then spake to the saint, saying, 'This<br>deed we ask thee to achieve, viz., to drink up the great ocean. O<br>magnanimous (saint)! Then we shall be able to slay those enemies of the<br>gods, known by the name of Kalakeyas, together with all their adherents.'<br>Having heard the words of the gods, the saint said, 'Let it be so&#8212;I<br>shall do even what ye desire, and that which will conduce to the great<br>happiness of men.' Having said this, he then proceeded to the ocean&#8212;the<br>lord of rivers,&#8212;accompanied by sages, ripe in the practice of penances,<br>and also by the deities, O thou who leadest an excellent life! And men<br>and snakes, celestial choristers, Yakshas and Kinnaras followed the<br>magnanimous saints,&#8212;desirous of witnessing that wonderful event. Then<br>they came up all together near to the sea, of awful roar, dancing, as it<br>were, with its billows, bounding with the breeze, and laughing with<br>masses of froth, and stumbling at the caves, and thronged with diverse<br>kinds of sharks, and frequented by flocks of various birds. And the<br>deities accompanied by Agastya and celestial choristers and huge snakes<br>and highly-gifted saints, approached the immense watery waste."
