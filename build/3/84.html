                            "Pulastya said, 'Then, O great king, one should proceed to the excellent<br>tirtha of Dharma, where the illustrious god of justice had practised<br>highly meritorious austerities. And it is for this that he made the spot<br>a sacred tirtha and rendered it celebrated by his own name. Bathing<br>there, O king, a virtuous man with concentrated soul certainly<br>sanctifieth his family to the seventh generation. One should then repair,<br>O king, to the excellent Jnanapavana. Sojourning thither, one obtaineth<br>the merit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice, and goeth to the region of the<br>Munis. Then, O monarch, a man should repair to the Saugandhika-vana.<br>There dwell the celestials with Brahma at their head, Rishis endued with<br>wealth of asceticism, the Siddhas, the Charanas, the Gandharvas, the<br>Kinnaras and the serpents. As soon as one entereth these woods, he is<br>cleansed of all his sins. Then, O king, should one repair to the sacred<br>goddess Saraswati, known there as the goddess Plaksha, that best of<br>streams and foremost of rivers. There should one bathe in the water<br>issuing from an ant-hill. (Bathing there and) worshipping the Pitris and<br>the gods, one obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice. There existeth<br>a rare tirtha called Isanadhyushita, lying from the ant-hill at the<br>distance of six throws of a heavy stick. As seen in the Puranas, O tiger<br>among men, bathing there a man obtaineth the merit of giving away a<br>thousand Kapila kine and of the horse-sacrifice. Journeying next, O<br>foremost of men, to Sugandha, and Satakumbha and Panchayaksha, a man<br>becometh adored in heaven. Repairing to another tirtha there called<br>Trisulakhata, one should bathe and set himself to worship the Pitris and<br>the gods. Doing so, without doubt, one obtaineth, after death, the status<br>of Ganapatya. One should next proceed, O king, to the excellent spot of<br>the Goddess celebrated over the three worlds by the name of Sakamvari.<br>There, for the space of a thousand celestial years, she of excellent<br>vows, month after month, had subsisted upon herbs, O king of men! And<br>attracted by their reverence for the Goddess, many Rishis with wealth of<br>asceticism, came thither, O Bharata. and were entertained by her with<br>herbs. And it is for this that they bestowed on her the name of<br>Sakamvari. O Bharata, the man who arriveth at Sakamvari, with rapt<br>attention and leading a Brahmacharya mode of life and passeth three<br>nights there in purity and subsisting on herbs alone, obtaineth, at the<br>will of the goddess, the merit of him that liveth upon herbs for twelve<br>years. Then should one proceed to the tirtha called Suvarna, famed<br>through the three worlds. There in days of old, Vishnu had paid his<br>adorations to Rudra, for his grace, and obtaineth also many boons<br>difficult of acquisition even by the gods. And, O Bharata, the gratified<br>destroyer of Tripura said, 'O Krishna, thou shalt, without doubt, be much<br>beloved in the world, and the foremost of everything in the universe.'<br>Repairing thither, O king, and worshipping the deity having the bull for<br>his mark, one obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice as also the<br>status of Ganapatya. One should next proceed to the tirtha of Dhumavati.<br>Fasting there for three nights, one obtaineth, without doubt, all the<br>wishes cherished by him. To the southern half of this spot of the<br>Goddess, there is, O king, a tirtha called Rathavarta. One should, O<br>virtuous one, go up to that place, with devout heart, and having his<br>senses under control. By this, through the grace of Mahadeva, one<br>attaineth to an exalted state. After walking round the place, one should,<br>O bull of the Bharata race, proceed to the tirtha named Dhara, which, O<br>thou of great wisdom, washeth off all sins. Bathing there, O tiger among<br>men, a man is freed from every sorrow. One should then repair, O virtuous<br>one, after bowing to the great mountain (Himavat), to the source of the<br>Ganges, which is, without doubt, like the gate of heaven. There should<br>one, with concentrated soul, bathe in the tirtha called Koti. By this,<br>one obtaineth the merit of the Pundarika sacrifice, and delivereth his<br>race. Residing one night there, one acquireth the merit of giving away a<br>thousand kine. By offering oblations of water duly to the gods and the<br>Pitris, at Saptaganga, Triganga and Sakravarta, (which are all there),<br>becometh adored in the regions of the virtuous. Bathing next at<br>Kanakhala, and fasting there for three nights, a person reapeth the merit<br>of the horse-sacrifice and goeth to heaven. Then O lord of men, the<br>pilgrim should repair to Kapilavata. Fasting for one night there, he<br>obtaineth the merit of giving away a thousand kine. O king, there is a<br>tirtha of the illustrious Kapila, king of the Nagas, that is celebrated,<br>O thou best of Kurus, over all the worlds. Bathing there at the<br>Nagatirtha one obtaineth, O king, the merit of giving away a thousand<br>Kapila kine. One should next repair to the excellent tirtha of Santanu,<br>called Lalitika. Bathing there, O king, one never sinketh into distress<br>(hereafter). The man that bathes at the confluence of the Ganga and the<br>Yamuna, obtains the merit of ten horse-sacrifices, and also rescues his<br>race. One should next, O king, go to Sugandha, celebrated over the world.<br>By this, cleansed of every sin, he becometh adored in the abode of<br>Brahma. Then, O lord of men, the pilgrim should repair to Rudravarta.<br>Bathing there, one ascendeth to heaven. Bathing at the confluence of the<br>Ganga and the Saraswati, a person obtaineth the merit of the<br>horse-sacrifice and also ascendeth to heaven. Proceeding next to<br>Bhadrakarneswara and worshipping the gods duly, one, without sinking into<br>distress, becometh adored in heaven. Then, O lord of men, the pilgrim<br>should proceed to the tirtha called Kuvjamraka. By this he obtaineth the<br>merit of giving away a thousand kine, and heaven also. Then, O king, the<br>pilgrim should go to the Arundhativata. Proceeding thither with<br>concentrated soul and practising the Brahmacharya vows, one that batheth<br>in Samudraka and fasteth for three nights, obtaineth the merit of the<br>horse-sacrifice and of giving away a thousand kine, and also rescueth his<br>race. One should next proceed to Brahmavarta, with concentrated soul and<br>practising the Brahmacharya vows. By this, one obtaineth the merit of the<br>horse-sacrifice, and goeth to the region of Soma. The man that proceedeth<br>to the Yamuna-prabhava, (the source of the Yamuna) and batheth there,<br>obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice and is worshipped in heaven.<br>Arriving at Darvisankramana, that tirtha which is worshipped of the three<br>worlds, a person obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice and goeth to<br>heaven. Repairing next to Sindhu-prabhava (the source of the Indus) which<br>is worshipped by Siddhas and Gandharvas, and staying there for five<br>nights, one obtaineth the merit of giving away gold in abundance.<br>Proceeding next to the inaccessible tirtha called Vedi, one obtaineth the<br>merit of the horse-sacrifice and ascendeth to heaven. Then, O Bharata,<br>should one proceed to Rishikulya and Vasishtha. By visiting the latter,<br>all orders attain to Brahmanhood. Repairing to Rishikulya and bathing<br>there, and living a month upon herbs, and worshipping the gods and<br>Pitris, one is cleansed of all his sins, and obtaineth the region of the<br>Rishis. Proceeding next to Bhrigutunga a person acquireth the merit of<br>the horse-sacrifice. Repairing then to Vipramoksha, one is freed from<br>every sin. Proceeding then to the tirtha of Krittika and Magha, one, O<br>Bharata, obtaineth the merit superior to that of the Agnishtoma and<br>Atiratha sacrifices. The man who, repairing to the excellent tirtha<br>called Vidya, batheth there in the evening, obtaineth proficiency in<br>every kind of knowledge. One should next reside for one night at<br>Mahasrama capable of destroying every sin, taking a single meal. By this,<br>one obtains many auspicious regions, and delivers ten preceding and ten<br>succeeding generations of his race. Dwelling next for a month of<br>Mahalaya, and fasting there for three nights, one's soul is cleansed of<br>all sins and one acquires the merit of giving away gold in abundance.<br>Proceeding next to Vetasika worshipped by the Grandsire, one obtaineth<br>the merit of the horse-sacrifice and the state of Usanas. Going next to<br>the tirtha called Sundarika, worshipped by the Siddhas, one obtaineth<br>personal beauty as witnessed by the ancients. Proceeding next to Brahmani<br>with subdued senses and observing the Brahmacharya vow, a person<br>ascendeth to the region of Brahma on a lotus-hued car. One should repair<br>next to the sacred Naimisha, worshipped by the Siddhas. There dwelleth<br>for aye Brahma with the gods. By only purposing to go to Naimisha, half<br>one's sins are destroyed; by entering it, one is cleansed of all his<br>sins. The pilgrim of subdued senses should stay at Naimisha for a month;<br>for, O Bharata, all the tirthas of the earth are at Naimisha. Bathing<br>there, with restrained senses and regulated fare, one obtains, O Bharata,<br>the merit of the cow-sacrifice, and also sanctifies, O best of the<br>Bharatas, his race for seven generations both upwards and downwards. He<br>who renounceth his life at Naimisha by fasting, enjoyeth happiness in the<br>heavenly regions. Even this is the opinion of the wise. O foremost of<br>kings, Naimisha is ever sacred and holy. Proceeding next to Gangodbheda<br>and fasting there for three nights, a man obtaineth the merit of the<br>Vajapeya sacrifice, and becometh like unto Brahma himself. Journeying to<br>the Saraswati, one should offer oblations unto the gods and the Pitris.<br>By this, one certainly enjoyeth bliss in the regions called Saraswata.<br>Then should one wend to Vahuda, with subdued soul and observing the<br>Brahmacharya vow. Residing there for one night, one becometh adored in<br>heaven, and obtaineth also, O Kaurava, the merit of the Devasatra<br>sacrifice. Then should one repair to the holy Kshiravati, frequented by<br>holier men. By worshipping the gods and the Pitris there, one obtains the<br>merit of the Vajapeya sacrifice. Proceeding next to Vimalasoka, with<br>subdued soul and observing the Brahmacharya vow, and residing there for<br>one night, one is adored in heaven. One should next proceed to the<br>excellent Gopratra in the Sarayu, whence Rama, O king, with all his<br>attendants and animals, renouncing his body, ascended to heaven in<br>consequence of the efficacy of the tirtha alone. Bathing in that tirtha,<br>O Bharata, one's soul, through Rama's grace, and by virtue of his own<br>deeds, being cleansed of all sins, one becometh adored in heaven. O<br>Bharata! Proceeding next, O son of the Kuru race, to the Rama-tirtha on<br>the Gomati, and bathing there, one obtaineth the merit of the<br>horse-sacrifice, and sanctifieth also his own race. There, O bull of the<br>Bharata race, is another tirtha called Satasahasrika. Bathing there, with<br>restrained senses and regulated diet, a person reapeth, O bull of Bharata<br>race, the merit of giving away a thousand kine. Then should one, O king,<br>go to the unrivalled tirtha called Bhartristhana. By this, a person<br>obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice. Bathing next in the tirtha<br>called Koti, and worshipping Kartikeya, a man reapeth, O king, the merit<br>of giving away a thousand kine, and acquireth great energy. Proceeding<br>next to Varanasi, and worshipping the god having the bull for his mark,<br>after a bath in the Kapilahrada, one obtaineth the merit of the Rajasuya<br>sacrifice. Repairing then, O perpetuator of the Kuru race, to the tirtha<br>called Avimukta, and beholding there the god of gods, the pilgrim, from<br>such sight alone, is immediately cleansed of even the sin of slaying a<br>Brahmana. By renouncing one's life there, one obtaineth deliverance.<br>Arriving next, O king, at the rare tirtha called Markandeya celebrated<br>over the world and situated at the confluence of the Ganges, a person<br>obtaineth the merit of Agnishtoma sacrifice, and delivereth his race.<br>Sojourning next to Gaya, with subdued senses and observing the<br>Brahmacharya vow, one obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice and also<br>rescueth his race. There in that tirtha is the Akshaya-vata, celebrated<br>over the three worlds. Whatever is offered there to the Pitris is said to<br>become inexhaustible. Bathing there at the Mahanadi, and offering<br>oblations to the gods and the Pitris, a man acquireth eternal regions,<br>and also rescueth his race. Proceeding then to Brahma-sara that is<br>adorned by the woods of Dharma, and passing one night there, a man<br>attaineth to the region of Brahma. In that lake, Brahma had raised a<br>sacrificial pillar. By walking round this pillar, a person acquireth the<br>merit of the Vajapeya sacrifice. One should next, O mighty monarch, go to<br>Denuka celebrated over the world. Staying there for one night and giving<br>away sesame and kine, one's soul being cleansed from every sin, one<br>ascendeth, without doubt to the region of Soma. There, O king, on the<br>mountains, the cow called Kapila used to range with her calf. There is<br>little doubt, of this, O Bharata, the hoof-marks, of that cow and her<br>calf are seen there to this day. By bathing in those hoof-prints, O<br>foremost of monarchs, whatever sin a man may have incurred is, O Bharata,<br>washed away. Then should one go to Gridhravata, the spot consecrated to<br>the trident-bearing god. Approaching the deity having the bull for his<br>mark one should rub himself with ashes. If a Brahmana, he obtains the<br>merit of observing the twelve year's vow and if belonging to any of the<br>other orders, he is freed from all his sins. One should next proceed to<br>the Udyanta mountains, resounding with melodious notes. There, O bull of<br>the Bharata race, is still seen the foot-print of Savitri. The Brahmana<br>of rigid vows, who sayeth his morning, noon and evening prayers there,<br>obtaineth the merit of performing that service for twelve years. There, O<br>bull of the Bharata race, is the famous Yonidwara. Repairing thither, a<br>person becometh exempted from the pain of rebirth. The person that<br>stayeth at Gaya during both the dark and lighted fortnights, certainly<br>sanctifieth, O king, his own race up and down to the seventh generation.<br>One should wish for many sons so that even one may go to Gaya, or<br>celebrate the horse-sacrifice, or offer a nila bull. Then, O king, the<br>pilgrim should proceed to Phalgu. By this, he obtains the merit of<br>horse-sacrifice, and acquires great success. O king, one should repair<br>then, with subdued soul, to Dharmaprishta. There, O foremost of warriors,<br>dwelleth Dharma for aye. Drinking of the water of a well which is there,<br>and purifying one's self by a bath, he that offereth oblations to the<br>gods and the Pitris is cleansed of all his sins and ascendeth to heaven.<br>There in that tirtha is the hermitage of the great Rishi Matanga of soul<br>under complete control. By entering that beautiful asylum capable of<br>soothing fatigue and sorrow, one earneth the merit of the Gavayana<br>sacrifice, and by touching (the image of) Dharma which is there, one<br>obtaineth the fruit of the horse-sacrifice. One should next go, O king,<br>to the excellent tirtha called Brahmasthana. Approaching Brahma, that<br>bull among male beings, who is there, one acquireth, O mighty monarch,<br>the merit of the Rajasuya and horse-sacrifices. The pilgrim should then<br>repair to Rajasuya, O king of men! Bathing there, one liveth (in heaven)<br>as happily as (the Rishi) Kakshiyan. After purifying himself, one should<br>partake there of the offerings daily made unto the Yakshini. By this, one<br>is freed from the sin of even slaying a Brahmana, through the Yakshini's<br>grace. Proceeding next to Maninaga, one obtains the merit of giving away<br>a thousand kine. O Bharata, he that eateth anything relating to the<br>tirtha of Maninaga, if bitten by a venomous snake, doth not succumb to<br>its poison. Residing there for one night, one is cleansed of one's sins.<br>Then should one proceed to the favourite wood of the Brahmarshi Gautama.<br>There bathing in the lake of Ahalya, one attaineth to an exalted state.<br>Beholding next the image of Sree, one acquireth great prosperity. There<br>in that tirtha is a well celebrated over the three worlds. Bathing in it,<br>one obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice. There also existeth a<br>well sacred to the royal Rishi Janaka, which is worshipped by the gods.<br>Bathing in the well, one ascendeth to the region of Vishnu. Then should<br>one repair to Vinasana that destroys every sin. By a sojourn thither, one<br>obtaineth the merit of the Vajapeya sacrifice, and goeth also to the<br>region of Soma. Proceeding next to Gandaki which is produced by the<br>waters of every tirtha, a person acquireth the merit of the Vajapeya<br>sacrifice, and ascendeth also to the solar region.

Proceeding next to the river Kampana, visited by the Siddhas,<br>one obtaineth the merit of the Pundarika sacrifice, and ascendeth also to<br>heaven. Arriving then, O lord of earth, at the stream called Maheswari,<br>one obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice and also rescueth his own<br>race. Repairing next to the tank of the celestials, one earneth immunity<br>from misfortune, and also the merit of the horse-sacrifice. One should<br>next go to Somapada, with subdued soul and leading a Brahmacharya mode of<br>life. Bathing in Maheswarapada that is there, one reapeth the merit of<br>the horse-sacrifice. There in that tirtha, O bull of the Bharata race, it<br>is well known that ten millions of tirthas exist together. A wicked Asura<br>in the shape of a tortoise had, O foremost of monarchs, been carrying it<br>away when the powerful Vishnu recovered it from him. There in that tirtha<br>should one perform his ablutions, for by this he acquireth the merit of<br>the Pundarika sacrifice and ascendeth also to the region of Vishnu. Then,<br>O best of kings, should one proceed to the place of Narayana, where, O<br>Bharata, Narayana is ever present and dwelleth for aye. There the gods<br>with Brahma at their head, Rishis endued with wealth of asceticism, the<br>Adityas, the Vasus, and the Rudras, all adore Janardana, in that tirtha,<br>and Vishnu of wonderful deeds hath become known as Salagrama. Approaching<br>the eternal Vishnu, that lord of the three worlds, that giver of boons,<br>one obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice, and goeth to the region<br>of Vishnu. There in that place, O virtuous one, is a well, capable of<br>destroying every sin. The four seas are ever present in that well. He<br>that bathes in it, O king, will have immunity from misfortune. Beholding<br>(the image of) the boon-giving, eternal, and fierce Mahadeva who is<br>there, one shineth, O king, like the moon emerged from the cloud. Bathing<br>then in Jatismara, with pure mind and subdued senses, one acquireth,<br>without doubt, the recollections of his former life. Proceeding then to<br>Maheswarapura, and worshipping the god having the bull for his mark,<br>fasting the while, one obtaineth, without doubt, the fruition of all his<br>desires. Repairing then to Vamana that destroys every sin, and beholding<br>the god Hari, one acquireth exemption from every misfortune.

By fasting there for three nights,<br>a man acquireth the merit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. By visiting<br>Kanya-samvedya, with senses restrained and regulated fare, one acquireth,<br>O bull among men, the region of Manu, the lord of creation.

Arriving next at<br>Nischira celebrated over the three worlds, one obtaineth the merit of the<br>horse-sacrifice and goeth to the legion of Vishnu.

By a month's residence there, one reapeth the merit of the<br>horse-sacrifice. He that resideth at the best of tirthas called<br>Maha-hrada, enjoys immunity from misfortune, and also obtains the merit<br>of giving away gold in abundance. Beholding next Kartikeya who dwelleth<br>at Virasrama, a man certainly reapeth the fruit of the horse-sacrifice.<br>Proceeding then to Agnidhara celebrated over the three worlds, and<br>beholding there after a bath the eternal and boon-giving Vishnu, that god<br>of gods, one obtaineth the merit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice.
