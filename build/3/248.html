                            "Kama continued, 'O king, this conduct of thine to-day appeareth to be<br>childish. O hero, O slayer of foes, what is to be wondered at in this<br>that the Pandavas liberated thee when thou wert vanquished by the foe? O<br>son of the Kuru race, those that reside in the territories of the king,<br>especially those (amongst them) that lead the profession of arms, should<br>always do what is agreeable to the king whether they happen to be known<br>to their monarch or unknown to him. It happened often that foremost men<br>who crush the ranks of the hostile host, are vanquished by them, and are<br>rescued by their own troops. They that leading the profession of arms,<br>reside in the king's realm should always combine and exert themselves to<br>the best of their power, for the king. If, therefore, O king, the<br>Pandavas, who live in the territories, have liberated thee, what is there<br>to be regretted at in this? That the Pandavas, O best of kings, did not<br>follow thee when thou didst march forth to battle at the head of thy<br>troops, has been an improper act on their part. They had before this come<br>under thy power, becoming thy slaves. They are, therefore, bound to aid<br>thee now, being endued with courage and might and incapable of turning<br>away from the field of battle. Thou art enjoying all the rich possessions<br>of the Pandavas. Behold them yet alive, O king! They have not resolved to<br>die, forgoing all food. Blest be thou! Rise up, O king! It behoveth thee<br>not to indulge in great sorrow long. O king, it is the certain duty of<br>those that reside in the king's realm to do what is agreeable to the<br>king. Where should the regret be in all this? If thou, O king, dost not<br>act according to my words I shall stay here employed in reverentially<br>serving thy feet. O bull among men, I do not desire to live deprived of<br>thy company. O king, if thou resolvest to slay thyself by forgoing food,<br>thou wilt simply be an object of laughter with other kings."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed by Karna, king Duryodhana, firmly<br>resolved to leave the world, desired not to rise from where he sat."
