                            "Bhimasena said, 'Without beholding thy former shape, I will never go<br>away. If I have found favour with thee, do thou then show me thine own<br>shape."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Being thus addressed by Bhima, the monkey with a<br>smile showed him that form of his in which he had bounded over the main.<br>And wishing to gratify his brother, Hanuman assumed a gigantic body which<br>(both) in length and breadth increased exceedingly. And that monkey of<br>immeasurable effulgence stood there, covering the plantain grove<br>furnished with trees, and elevating himself to the height reached by the<br>Vindhya. And the monkey, having attained his lofty and gigantic body like<br>unto a mountain, furnished with coppery eyes, and sharp teeth, and a face<br>marked by frown, lay covering all sides and lashing his long tail. And<br>that son of the Kurus, Bhima, beholding that gigantic form of his<br>brother, wondered, and the hairs of his body repeatedly stood on end. And<br>beholding him like unto the sun in splendour, and unto a golden mountain,<br>and also unto the blazing firmament, Bhima closed his eyes. Thereupon<br>Hanuman addressed Bhima with a smile, saying, 'O sinless one, thou art<br>capable of beholding my size up to this extent. I can, however, go on<br>swelling my size as long as I wish. And, O Bhima, amidst foes, my size<br>increaseth exceedingly by its own energy.'<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Witnessing that dreadful and wonderful body of<br>Hanuman, like unto the Vindhya mountain, the son of the wind-god became<br>bewildered. Then with his down standing erect, the noble-minded Bhima,<br>joining his hands, replied unto Hanuman saying (there), 'O lord, by me<br>have been beheld the vast dimensions of thy body. Do thou (now), O highly<br>powerful one, decrease thyself by thy own power. Surely I cannot look at<br>thee, like unto the sun risen, and of immeasurable (power), and<br>irrepressible, and resembling the mountain Mainaka. O hero, to-day this<br>wonder of my heart is very great, that thou remaining by his side, Rama<br>should have encountered Ravana personally. Depending on the strength of<br>thy arms, thou wert capable of instantly destroying Lanka, with its<br>warriors, and horses, elephants and chariots. Surely, O son of the<br>wind-god, there is nothing that is incapable of being achieved by thee;<br>and in fight, Ravana together with his followers was no match for thee<br>single-handed."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed by Bhima, Hanuman, the chief of<br>monkeys, answered in affectionate words uttered in solemn accents. "O<br>mighty-armed one, O Bharata, it is even as thou sayest. O Bhimasena, that<br>worst of Rakshasas was no match for me. But if I had slain Ravana&#8212;that<br>thorn of the worlds&#8212;the glory of Raghu's son would have been<br>obscured;&#8212;and for this it is that I left him alone. By slaying that lord<br>of the Rakshasas together with his followers, and bringing back Sita unto<br>his own city, that hero hath established his fame among men. Now, O<br>highly wise one, being intent on the welfare of thy brothers, and<br>protected by the wind-god, do thou go along a fortunate and auspicious<br>way. O foremost of the Kurus, this way will lead thee to the Saugandhika<br>wood. (Proceeding in this direction), thou wilt behold the gardens of<br>Kuvera, guarded by Yakshas and Rakshasas. Do thou not pluck the flowers<br>(there) personally by thy own force; for the gods deserve regard<br>specially from mortals. O best of the Bharata race, the gods confer their<br>favour (upon men), (being propitiated) by offerings, and homas, and<br>reverential salutations, and recitation of mantras, and veneration, O<br>Bharata. Do thou not, therefore, act with rashness, O child; and do thou<br>not deviate from the duties of thy order. Sticking to the duties of thy<br>order, do thou understand and follow the highest morality. Without<br>knowing duties and serving the old, even persons like unto Vrihaspati<br>cannot understand profit and religion. One should ascertain with<br>discrimination those cases in which vice goeth under the name of virtue,<br>and virtue goeth under the name of vice,&#8212;(cases) in which people<br>destitute of intelligence become perplexed. From religious observances<br>proceedeth merit; and in merit are established the Vedas; and from the<br>Vedas sacrifices come into existence; and by sacrifices are established<br>the gods. The gods are maintained by the (celebration of) sacrifices<br>prescribed by the Vedas and the religious ordinances; while men maintain<br>themselves by (following) the ordinances of Vrihaspati and Usanas and<br>also by these avocations, by which the world is maintained,&#8212;serving for<br>wages, (receiving) taxes, merchandise, agriculture and tending kine and<br>sheep. The world subsisteth by profession. The (study of the) three Vedas<br>and agriculture and trade and government constitutes, it is ordained by<br>the wise, the professions of the twice born ones; and each order<br>maintaineth itself by following the profession prescribed for it. And<br>when these callings are properly pursued, the world is maintained with<br>ease. If, however, people do not righteously lead their lives, the world<br>becometh lawless, in consequence of the want of Vedic merit and<br>government. And if people do not resort to (their) prescribed vocations,<br>they perish, but by regularly following the three professions, they bring<br>about religion. The religion of the Brahmanas consisteth in the knowledge<br>of the soul and the hue of that order alone is universally the same. The<br>celebration of sacrifices, and study and bestowal of gifts are well-known<br>to be the three duties common (to all these orders). Officiating at<br>sacrifices, teaching and the acceptance of gifts are the duties of a<br>Brahmana. To rule (the subjects) is the duty of the Kshatriya; and to<br>tend (cattle), that of the Vaisya, while to serve the twice-born orders<br>is said to be the duty of the Sudra. The Sudras cannot beg alms, or<br>perform homas, or observe vows; and they must dwell in the habitation of<br>their masters. Thy vocation, O son of Kunti, is that of the Kshatriya,<br>which is to protect (the subjects). Do thou carry out thy own duties, in<br>an humble spirit, restraining thy senses. That king alone can govern, who<br>taketh counsel of experienced men, and is helped by honest, intelligent<br>and learned ministers; but a king who is addicted to vices, meeteth with<br>defeat. Then only is the order of the world secured, when the king duly<br>punisheth and conferreth favours. Therefore, it is necessary to ascertain<br>through spies the nature of the hostile country, its fortified places and<br>the allied force of the enemy and their prosperity and decay and the way<br>in which they retain the adhesion of the powers they have drawn to their<br>side. Spies are among the important auxiliaries of the king; and tact,<br>diplomacy, prowess, chastisement, favour and cleverness lead to success.<br>And success is to be attained through these, either in separation, or<br>combined&#8212;namely, conciliation, gift, sowing dissensions, chastisement,<br>and sight. And, O chief of the Bharatas, polity hath for its root<br>diplomacy; and diplomacy also is the main qualification of spies. And<br>polity, if well judged conferreth success. Therefore, in matters of<br>polity the counsels of Brahmanas should be resorted to. And in secret<br>affairs, these should not be consulted,&#8212;namely, a woman, a sot, a boy, a<br>covetous person a mean-minded individual, and he that betrayeth signs of<br>insanity. Wise men only should be consulted, and affairs are to be<br>despatched through officers that are able. And polity must be executed<br>through persons that are friendly; but dunces should in all affairs be<br>excluded. In matters religious, pious men; and in matters of gain, wise<br>men; and in guarding families, eunuchs; and in all crooked affairs,<br>crooked men, must be employed. And the propriety or impropriety of the<br>resolution of the enemy, as also their strength or weakness, must be<br>ascertained through one's own as well as hostile spies. Favour should be<br>shown to honest persons that have prudently sought protection; but<br>lawless and disobedient individuals should be punished. And when the king<br>justly punisheth and showeth favour, the dignity of the law is well<br>maintained, O son of Pritha, thus have I expounded, unto thee the hard<br>duties of kings difficult to comprehend. Do thou with equanimity observe<br>these as prescribed for thy order. The Brahmanas attain heaven through<br>merit, mortification of the senses, and sacrifice. The Vaisyas attain<br>excellent state through gifts, hospitality, and religious acts. The<br>Kshatriyas attain the celestial regions by protecting and chastising the<br>subjects, uninfluenced by lust, malice, avarice and anger. If kings<br>justly punish (their subjects), they go to the place whither repair<br>meritorious persons.'
