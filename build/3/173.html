                            "Arjuna continued, 'Then firmly confident, the sovereign of the<br>celestials considering as his own, pertinently said these words unto me<br>wounded by cleaving shafts, 'All the celestial weapons, O Bharata, are<br>with thee, so no man on earth will by any means be able to over-power<br>thee. And, O son, when thou art in the field, Bhishma and Drona and Kripa<br>and Karna and Sakuni together with other Kshatriyas shall not amount unto<br>one-sixteenth part of thee.' And the lord Maghavan granted me this golden<br>garland and this shell, Devadatta, of mighty roars, and also his<br>celestial mail impenetrable and capable of protecting the body. And Indra<br>himself set on my (head) this diadem. And Sakra presented me with these<br>unearthly apparels and unearthly ornaments, elegant and rare. In this<br>manner, O king, (duly) honoured, I delightfully dwelt in Indra's sacred<br>abode with the children of the Gandharvas. Then, well-pleased, Sakra,<br>together with the celestials, addressed me, saying, 'O Arjuna, the time<br>hath come for thy departure; thy brothers have thought of thee.' Thus, O<br>Bharata, remembering the dissensions arising from that gambling, did I, O<br>king, pass those five years in the abode of Indra. Then have I come and<br>seen thee surrounded by our brothers on the summit of this lower range of<br>the Gandhamadana.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O Dhananjaya, by fortune it is that the weapons have<br>been obtained by thee; by fortune it is that the master of the immortals<br>hath been adored by thee. O repressor of foes, by fortune it is that the<br>divine Sthanu together with the goddess had become manifest unto thee and<br>been gratified by thee in battle, O sinless one; by fortune it is that<br>thou hadst met with the Lokapalas, O best of the Bharatas. O Partha, by<br>fortune it is that we have prospered; and by fortune it is that thou hast<br>come back. To-day I consider as if the entire earth engarlanded with<br>cities hath already been conquered, and as if the sons of Dhritarashtra<br>have already been subdued. Now, O Bharata, I am curious to behold those<br>celestial weapons wherewith thou hadst slain the powerful<br>Nivata-Kavachas.'"<br><br>"Thereat Arjuna said, 'Tomorrow in the morning thou wilt see all the<br>celestial weapons with which I slew the fierce Nivata-Kavachas.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Thus having related (the facts touching) the arrival,<br>Dhananjaya passed that night there, together with all his brothers."
