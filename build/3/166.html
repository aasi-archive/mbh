                            Vaisampayana continued, "When Sakra had gone to his proper place,<br>Vibhatsu together with his brothers and Krishna, paid homage unto the son<br>of Dharma. Then smelling the crown of the head of that Pandava, who was<br>thus paying homage, (Yudhishthira) in accents faltering on account of<br>you, addressed Arjuna, saying 'O Arjuna, how didst thou pass this period<br>in heaven? And how has thou obtained the weapons, and how also hast thou<br>gratified the lord of the celestials? And, O Pandava, has thou adequately<br>secured the weapons? Have the lord of the celestials and Rudra gladly<br>granted thee the weapons? And how hast thou beheld the divine Sakra, and<br>the wielder of Pinaka? And how has thou obtained the weapons? And in what<br>manner didst thou worship (them)? And what service hadst thou done unto<br>that repressor of foes, the worshipful one of a hundred sacrifices, that<br>he said unto thee, 'By thee have I been gratified? All this, O highly<br>effulgent one, I wish to hear in detail. And, O sinless one, the manner<br>in which thou didst please Mahadeva and the king of the celestials and, O<br>repressor of foes, the service thou hadst done to the wielder of the<br>thunder-bolt,&#8212;do thou, O Dhananjaya, relate all this in detail."<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'O mighty monarch, listen how I duly beheld him of a<br>hundred sacrifice and the divine Sankara also. O grinder of foes, O king,<br>having acquired that science which thou hadst directed me (to learn), I<br>at thy command went to the forest, for practising penances. From Kamyaka<br>repairing to the Bhrigutunga, I spent there one night, being engaged in<br>austerities And it came to pass that on the next I saw a certain<br>Brahmana. And he asked me, saying, 'O son of Kunti, whither wilt thou<br>go?' Thereupon, O descendant of the Kurus, I truly related unto him<br>everything. And, O best of kings, having heard the true account, the<br>Brahmana became well-pleased with me, and, O king, praised me. Then the<br>Brahmana, pleased with me, said, 'O Bharata, be thou engaged in<br>austerities. By performing penances, thou wilt in a short time behold the<br>lord of the celestials.' And according to his advice I ascended the<br>Himavan, and, O mighty king, began to practise penances, (the first)<br>month subsisting on fruit and roots. I spent the second month, subsisting<br>on water. And, O Pandava, in the third month I totally abstained from<br>food. And in the fourth month I remained with upraised arms. And a wonder<br>it is that I did not lose any strength. And it came to pass that when the<br>first day of the fifth month had been spent, there appeared before me a<br>being wearing the form of a boar, turning up the earth with his mouth,<br>stamping the ground with his feet, rubbing the earth with his breast, and<br>momentarily going about in a frightful manner. And him followed a great<br>being in the guise of a hunter furnished with the bow, arrows, and the<br>sword, and surrounded by females. Thereupon, taking my bow and the two<br>inexhaustible quivers, I pierced with shafts that terrible and frightful<br>creature. And simultaneously (with me) that hunter also drawing a strong<br>bow, more severely struck at (the animal), as if shaking my mind. And, O<br>king, he also said unto me, 'Why hast thou, transgressing the rules of<br>hunting, hit the animal first hit at by me? With these sharpened shafts<br>will I destroy thy pride. Stay!' Then that mighty-bodied one holding the<br>bow rushed at me. And with volleys of mighty shafts, he covered me<br>entirely, even as a cloud covereth a mountain with showers. Then, on my<br>part, I covered him with a mighty discharge of arrows. Thereupon, with<br>steady arrows having their points aflame, and inspired with mantras, I<br>pierced him even as (Indra) riveth a mountain with a thunderbolt. Then<br>his person began to be multiplied a hundredfold and a thousandfold. At<br>this, I pierced all this bodies with shafts. Then again all those forms<br>became one, O Bharata. Thereat I struck at it. Next, he now assumed a<br>small body with a huge head, and now a huge body with a small head. And,<br>O king, he then assumed his former person and approached me for fight.<br>And, O foremost of the Bharata race, when in the encounter I failed to<br>overwhelm him with arrows, I fixed the mighty weapon of the Wind-god. But<br>I failed to discharge it at him, and this was a wonder. And when that<br>weapon thus failed of effect, I was struck with amazement. However, O<br>king, exerting myself more vigorously, I again covered that being with a<br>mighty multitude of shafts. Then taking Sthunakarna, and Varuna and<br>Salava, and Asmavarsha weapons, I assailed him, profusely showering<br>shafts. But, O king, he instantly swallowed up even all these weapons of<br>mine. And when all those (weapons) had been swallowed up, I discharged<br>the weapon presided over by Brahma. And when the blazing arrows issuing<br>from that weapon were heaped upon him all around, and being thus heaped<br>over by that mighty weapon discharged by me, he increased (in bulk). Then<br>all the world became oppressed with the energy begotten of the weapon<br>hurled by me, and the firmament and all the points of the sky became<br>illumined. But that one of mighty energy instantly baffled even that<br>weapon. And, O monarch, when that weapon presided over by Brahma had been<br>baffled I was possessed with terrible fear. Thereupon immediately holding<br>even my bow and the two inexhaustible quivers, I shot at that being, but<br>he swallowed up all those weapons. And when all the weapons had been<br>baffled and swallowed up, there ensued a wrestling between him and<br>myself. And we encountered each other first with blows and then with<br>slaps. But incapable of overcoming that being, I fell down stupefied on<br>the ground. Thereupon, O mighty king, with a laugh, that wonderful being<br>at my sight vanished at that spot together with the woman. Having<br>accomplished this, O illustrious monarch, that divine one assumed another<br>and unearthly form (clad in) wonderful raiment. And renouncing the form<br>of a hunter, that divine lord of the gods, resumed his own unearthly<br>appearance and that mighty god stood (there). Then appeared before me<br>with Uma that manifest divine one, having the bull for his mark, wielding<br>the Pinaka, bearing serpents and cable of assuming many forms. And, O<br>repressor of foes, advancing towards me, standing even then in the field<br>ready for conflict, that wielder of the trident addressed me saying, I am<br>well-pleased with thee. Then that divine one held up my bows and the<br>couple of quivers furnished with inexhaustible shafts and returned them<br>unto me saying, 'Do thou ask some boon, O Kunti's son. I am well-pleased<br>with thee. Tell me, what I shall do for thee. And, O hero, express the<br>desire that dwelleth in thy heart. I will grant it. Except immortality<br>alone, tell me as to the desire that is in thy heart. Thereat with my<br>mind intent on the acquisition of arms, I only bowed down unto Siva and<br>said, 'O divine one, if thou beest favourably disposed towards me, then I<br>wish to have this boon,&#8212;I wish to learn all the weapons that are with<br>thy god-head.' Then the god Tryamvaka said unto me, 'I will give. O<br>Pandava, my own weapon Raudra shall attend upon thee.' Thereupon<br>Mahadeva, well-pleased, granted to me the mighty weapon, Pasupata. And,<br>having granted that eternal weapon, he also said unto me, This must never<br>be hurled at mortals. If discharged at any person of small energy, it<br>would consume the universe. Shouldst thou (at any time) be hard pressed,<br>thou mayst discharge it. And when all thy weapons have been completely<br>baffled, thou mayst hurl it.' Then when he having the bull for his mark,<br>had been thus gratified, there stood manifest by my side that celestial<br>weapon, of resistless force capable of baffling all weapons and<br>destructive of foes and the hewer of hostile forces and unrivalled and<br>difficult to be borne even by the celestials, the demons and the<br>Rakshasas. Then at the command of that god, I sat me down there. And in<br>my very sight the god vanished from the spot.'"
