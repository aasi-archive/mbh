                            Vaisampayana said, "When they had left their happy home in the beautiful<br>mountain abounding in cascades, and having birds, and the elephants of<br>the eight quarters, and the supernatural attendants of Kuvera (as<br>dwellers thereof), all happiness forsook those foremost of men of<br>Bharata's race. But afterwards on beholding Kuvera's favourite mountain,<br>Kailasa, appearing like clouds, the delight of those pre-eminent heroes<br>of the race of Bharata, became very great. And those foremost of heroic<br>men, equipped with scimitars and bows, proceeded contentedly, beholding<br>elevations and defiles, and dens of lions and craggy causeways and<br>innumerable water-falls and lowlands, in different places, as also other<br>great forests inhabited by countless deer and birds and elephants. And<br>they came upon beautiful woodlands and rivers and lakes and caves and<br>mountain caverns; and these frequently by day and night became the<br>dwelling place of those great men. And having dwelt in all sorts of<br>inaccessible places and crossing Kailasa of inconceivable grandeur, they<br>reached the excellent and surpassingly beautiful hermitage of<br>Vrishaparba. And meeting king Vrishaparba and received by him being they<br>became free from depression and then they accurately narrated in detail<br>to Vrishaparba the story of their sojourn in the mountains. And having<br>pleasantly passed one night in his sacred abode frequented by gods and<br>Maharshis, those great warriors proceeded smoothly towards the jujube<br>tree called Visala and took up their quarters there. Then all those<br>magnanimous men having reached the place of Narayana, continued to live<br>there, bereft of all sorrow, at beholding Kuvera's favourite lake,<br>frequented by gods and Siddhas. And viewing that lake, those foremost of<br>men, the sons of Pandu traversed that place, renouncing all grief even as<br>immaculate Brahmana rishis (do) on attaining a habitation in the Nandana<br>gardens. Then all those warriors having in due course happily lived at<br>Badari for one month, proceeded towards the realm of Suvahu, king of the<br>Kiratas, by following the same track by which they had come. And crossing<br>the difficult Himalayan regions, and the countries of China, Tukhara,<br>Darada and all the climes of Kulinda, rich in heaps of jewels, those<br>warlike men reached the capital of Suvahu. And hearing that those sons<br>and grandsons of kings had all reached his kingdom, Suvahu, elated with<br>joy, advanced (to meet them). Then the best of the Kurus welcomed him<br>also. And meeting king Suvahu, and being joined by all their charioteers<br>with Visoka at their head and by their attendants, Indrasena and others,<br>and also by the superintendents and servants of the kitchen, they stayed<br>there comfortably for one night. Then taking all the chariots and<br>chariot-men and dismissing Ghatotkacha together with his followers, they<br>next repaired to the monarch of mountains in the vicinity of the Yamuna.<br>In the midst of the mountain abounding in waterfalls and having grey and<br>orange-coloured slopes and summits covered with a sheet of snow, those<br>warlike men having then found the great forest of Visakhayupa like unto<br>the forest of Chitraratha and inhabited by wild boars and various kinds<br>of deer and birds, made it their home. Addicted to hunting as their chief<br>occupation, the sons of Pritha peacefully dwelt in that forest for one<br>year. There in a cavern of the mountain, Vrikodara, with a heart<br>afflicted with distraction and grief, came across a snake of huge<br>strength distressed with hunger and looking fierce like death itself. At<br>this crisis Yudhishthira, the best of pious men, became the protector of<br>Vrikodara and he, of infinite puissance, extricated Bhima whose whole<br>body had been fast gripped by the snake with its folds. And the twelfth<br>year of their sojourn in forests having arrived, those scions of the race<br>of Kuru, blazing in effulgence, and engaged in asceticism, always devoted<br>principally to the practice of archery, repaired cheerfully from that<br>Chitraratha-like forest to the borders of the desert, and desirous of<br>dwelling by the Saraswati they went there, and from the banks of that<br>river they reached the lake of Dwaitabana. Then seeing them enter<br>Dwaitabana, the dwellers of that place engaged in asceticism, religious<br>ordinances, and self-restraining exercises and in deep and devout<br>meditation and subsisting on things ground with stone (for want of teeth)<br>having procured grass-mats and water-vessels, advanced to meet them. The<br>holy fig, the rudaraksha, the rohitaka, the cane and the jujube, the<br>catechu, the sirisha, the bel and the inguda and the karira and pilu and<br>sami trees grew on the banks of the Saraswati. Wandering about with<br>contentment in (the vicinity of) the Saraswati which was, as it were, the<br>home of the celestials, and the favourite (resort) of Yakshas and<br>Gandharvas and Maharshis, those sons of kings lived there in happiness."
