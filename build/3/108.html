                            "Lomasa said, 'That same king, of a powerful bow, standing at the head of<br>the surrounding, (i.e., the occupant of an imperial throne) of a powerful<br>car, (i.e., possessing every great fighting power) became the delight of<br>the eyes and the soul of all the world. And he of the powerful arm came<br>to learn how his forefathers had met an awful end from Kapila of mighty<br>soul, and how they had been unable to attain the region of gods. And he<br>with a sorrowful heart made over his kingly duties to his minister, and,<br>O lord of men! for practising austerities, went to the side of the snowy<br>Mountain (the Himalayas). And, O most praiseworthy of men, desirous of<br>extinguishing his sins by leading an austere life, and (thereby)<br>obtaining the favour of the (goddess) Ganga, he visited that foremost of<br>mountains&#8212;Himalaya. And he beheld it adorned with peaks of diverse forms<br>full of mineral earth; besprinkled on all sides with drops from clouds<br>which were resting themselves upon the breeze; beautiful with rivers and<br>groves and rocky spurs, looking like (so many) palaces (in a city);<br>attended upon by lions and tigers that had concealed themselves in its<br>caves and pits; and also inhabited by birds of checkered forms, which<br>were uttering diverse sounds, such as the Bhringarajas, and ganders, and<br>Datyuhas, and water-cocks, and peacocks and birds with a hundred<br>feathers, and Jivanjivakas, and black birds, and Chakoras of eyes<br>furnished with black corners, and the birds that love their young. And he<br>saw the mountain abounding in lotus plants growing in delightful<br>reservoirs of water. And the cranes rendered it charming with their<br>sounds; and the Kinnaras and the celestial nymphs were seated on its<br>stony slabs. And the elephants occupying the cardinal points had<br>everywhere robbed its trees with the end of their tusks; and the<br>demi-gods of the Vidyadhara class frequented the hill. And it was full of<br>various gems, and was also infested by snakes bearing terrible poison and<br>of glowing tongues. And the mountain at places looked like (massive)<br>gold, and elsewhere it resembled a silvery (pile), and at some places it<br>was like a (sable) heap of collyrium. Such was the snowy hill where the<br>king now found himself. And that most praiseworthy of men at that spot<br>betook himself to an awful austere course of life. And for one thousand<br>years his subsistence was nothing but water, fruit and roots. When,<br>however, a thousand years according to the calculation of gods had<br>elapsed, then the great river Ganga having assumed a material form,<br>manifested to him her (divine) self.'<br><br>"Ganga said. 'O great king! what dost thou desire of me? And what must I<br>bestow on thee? Tell me the same, O most praiseworthy of men! I shall do<br>as thou mayst ask me.' Thus addressed, the king then made his reply to<br>Ganga, the daughter of the snowy Hill, saying, 'O grantress of boons! O<br>great river! my father's fathers, while searching for the horse, were<br>sent by Kapila to the abode of the god of death. And those same sixty<br>thousand sons of Sagara of mighty soul, having met with the majestic<br>Kapila, perished, (to a soul) in an instant of time. Having thus<br>perished, there hath been no place for them in the region of heaven. O<br>great river! So long as thou dost not besprinkle those same bodies with<br>thy water, there is no salvation for these same Sagara's sons. O blessed<br>goddess! carry thou my forefathers, Sagara's sons, to the region of<br>heaven. O great river! on their account am I beseeching thee forsooth."<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'Ganga, the goddess saluted by the world, having heard<br>these words of the king, was well pleased, and spake to Bhagiratha the<br>following words: 'O great king! I am prepared to do what thou dost ask<br>me; there is no doubt therein. But when I shall descend from the sky to<br>the earth, the force of my fall will be difficult to sustain. O protector<br>of men! In the three worlds there exists none who is able to sustain the<br>same, excepting Siva, the most praiseworthy of gods, the great Lord with<br>the throat of sable blue. O (prince) of a powerful arm! Obtain the<br>favour, by practising austerities, of that same Siva-giver of boons. That<br>same god will sustain my descent upon his head. Thy desire he will<br>fulfill, the desire, namely, to be of service to thy fathers, O king!'<br>Then the great king Bhagiratha having heard the same, went to the Kailasa<br>hill, and betaking himself to a severe course of penances, at the<br>expiration of a certain length of time obtained the favour of that worker<br>of blessings (Siva). And, O protector of men! that same best of men, in<br>order that his forefathers might have a place in heaven secured to them,<br>received from that very Siva the fulfilment of his wish, namely the wish<br>that the descending Ganga might be sustained.'"
