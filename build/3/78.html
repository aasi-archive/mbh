                            "Vrihadaswa said, 'O son of Kunti, the ruler of the Nishadhas having<br>dwelt there for a month, set out from that city with Bhima's permission<br>and accompanied by only a few (followers) for the country of the<br>Nishadhas. With a single car white in hue, sixteen elephants, fifty<br>horses, and six hundred infantry, that illustrious king, causing the<br>earth itself to tremble, entered (the country of the Nishadhas) without<br>loss of a moment and swelling with rage. And the mighty son of Virasena,<br>approaching his brothers Pushkara said unto him, 'We will play again, for<br>I have earned vast wealth. Let Damayanti and all else that I have be my<br>stake, let, O Pushkara, thy kingdom be thy stake. Let the play begin<br>again. This is my certain determination. Blessed be thou, let us stake<br>all we have along with our lives. Having won over and acquired another's<br>wealth or kingdom, it is a high duty, says the ordinance, to stake it<br>when the owner demands. Or, if thou dost not relish play with dice, let<br>the play with weapons begin. O king, let me or thyself have peace by a<br>single combat. That this ancestral kingdom should, under all<br>circumstances and by any means, be recovered, there is the authority of<br>sages for holding. And, O Pushkara, choose thou one of these two<br>things&#8212;gambling with dice or bending the bow in battle!' Thus addressed<br>by Nishadha, Pushkara, sure of his own success, laughingly answered that<br>monarch, saying, 'O Naishadha, it is by good fortune that thou hast<br>earned wealth again to stake. It is by good fortune also that Damayanti's<br>ill-luck hath at last come to an end. And O king, it is by good fortune<br>that thou art still alive with thy wife, O thou of mighty arms! It is<br>evident that Damayanti, adorned with this wealth of thine that I will<br>win, will wait upon me like an Apsara in heaven upon Indra. O Naishadha,<br>I daily recollect thee and am even waiting for thee, since I derive no<br>pleasure from gambling with those that are not connected with me by<br>blood. Winning over to-day the beauteous Damayanti of faultless features,<br>I shall regard myself fortunate, indeed, since she it is that hath ever<br>dwelt in my heart.' Hearing these words of that incoherent braggart, Nala<br>in anger desired to cut off his head with a scimitar. With a smile,<br>however, though his eyes were red in anger, king Nala said, 'Let us play.<br>Why do you speak so now? Having vanquished me, you can say anything you<br>like.' Then the play commenced between Pushkara and Nala. And blessed be<br>Nala who at a single throw won his wealth and treasures back along with<br>the life of his brother that also had been staked. And the king, having<br>won, smilingly said unto Pushkara, 'This whole kingdom without a thorn in<br>its side is now undisturbedly mine. And, O worst of kings, thou canst not<br>now even look at the princess of Vidarbha. With all thy family, thou art<br>now, O fool, reduced to the position of her slave. But my former defeat<br>at thy hands was not due to any act of thine. Thou knowest it not, O<br>fool, that it was Kali who did it all. I shall not, therefore, impute to<br>thee the faults of others. Live happily as thou choosest, I grant thee<br>thy life. I also grant thee thy portion (in the paternal kingdom) along<br>with all necessaries. And, O hero, without doubt, my affection towards<br>thee is now the same as before. My fraternal love also for thee will<br>never know any diminution. O Pushkara, thou art my brother, live thou for<br>a hundred years!'"<br><br>"And Nala of unbaffled prowess, having comforted his brother thus gave<br>him permission to go to his own town, having embraced him repeatedly. And<br>Pushkara himself, thus comforted by the ruler of the Nishadhas saluted<br>that righteous king, and addressed him, O monarch, saying these words<br>with joined hands, 'Let thy fame be immortal and live thou happily for<br>ten thousand years, thou who grantest me, O king, both life and refuge.<br>And entertained by the king, Pushkara dwelt there for a month and then<br>went to his own town accompanied by large force and many obedient<br>servants and his own kindred, his heart filled with joy. And that bull<br>among men all the while blazed forth in beauty of person like a second<br>Sun. And the blessed ruler of the Nishadhas, having established Pushkara<br>and made him wealthy and freed him from troubles, entered his richly<br>decorated palace. And the ruler of the Nishadhas, having entered his<br>palace, comforted the citizens. And all the citizens and the subjects<br>from the country horripilated in joy. And the people headed by the<br>officers of state said with joined hands, 'O king, we are truly glad<br>to-day throughout the city and the country. We have obtained to-day our<br>ruler, like the gods their chief of a hundred sacrifice!'"
