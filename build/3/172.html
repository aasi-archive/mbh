                            "Arjuna continued, 'Then while returning, I happened to descry a mighty<br>unearthly city, moving at will, and having the effulgence of fire or the<br>sun. And that city contained various trees composed of gems, and<br>sweet-voiced feathered ones. And furnished with four gates, and<br>gate-ways, and towers, that impregnable (city) was inhabited by the<br>Paulamas and Kalakanjas. And it was made of all sorts of jewels and was<br>unearthly, and of wonderful appearance. And it was covered with trees of<br>all kinds of gems, bearing fruits and flowers. And it contained<br>exceedingly beautiful unearthly birds. And it always swarmed throughout<br>with cheerful Asuras, wearing garlands, and bearing in their hands darts,<br>two edged swords, maces, bows, and clubs. And, O king, on seeing this<br>wonderful city of the Daityas, I asked Matali saying, 'What is this that<br>looketh so wonderful?' Thereat, Matali replied, 'Once on a time a<br>Daitya's daughter, named Pulama and a mighty female of the Asura order,<br>Kalaka by name, practised severe austerities for a thousand celestial<br>years. And at the end of their austerities, the self-create conferred on<br>them boons. And, O king of kings, they received these boons,&#8212;that their<br>offspring might never suffer misfortune; that they might be incapable of<br>being destroyed even by the gods, the Rakshasas and the Pannagas; and<br>that they might obtain a highly effulgent and surpassingly fair aerial<br>city, furnished with all manner of gems and invincible even by the<br>celestials, the Maharshis, the Yakshas, the Gandharvas, the Pannagas, the<br>Asuras and the Rakshasas. O best of the Bharatas, this is that unearthly<br>aerial city devoid of the celestials, which is moving about, having been<br>created for the Kalakeyas, by Brahma himself. And this city is furnished<br>with all desirable objects, and is unknown of grief or disease. And, O<br>hero, celebrated under the name of Hiranyapura, this mighty city is<br>inhabited by the Paulamas and the Kalakanjas; and it is also guarded by<br>those mighty Asuras. And, O king, unslayed by any of the gods, there they<br>dwell cheerfully, free from anxiety and having all their desires<br>gratified, O foremost of kings. Formerly, Brahma had destined destruction<br>at the hands of mortals. Do thou, O Partha, in fight, compass with that<br>weapon&#8212;the thunder-bolt&#8212;the destruction of the mighty and irrepressible<br>Kalakanjas.'<br><br>"Arjuna continued, 'O lord of men, learning that they were incapable of<br>being destroyed by the celestials and the Asuras, I cheerfully said unto<br>Matali, 'Do thou speedily repair into yonder city. With weapons will I<br>compass the annihilation of the haters of the lord of the celestials.<br>Surely, there exist no wicked haters of the gods who ought not to be<br>slain by me.' Thereupon Matali took me to the vicinity of Hiranyapura on<br>the celestial chariot yoked with steeds. And seeing me, those sons of<br>Diti, wearing various kinds of attire and ornament and accoutred in mail,<br>flew at me with a mighty rush. And those foremost of the Danavas, of<br>exceeding prowess, in wrath attacked me with arrows and bhallas and clubs<br>and two-edged swords, and tomaras. Thereat, O king, resorting to my<br>strength of lore, I resisted that great volley of weapons by a mighty<br>shower of shafts; and also confounded them in conflict by ranging around<br>in my car. And being bewildered, the Danavas began to push each other<br>down. And having been confounded, they rushed at one another. And with<br>flaming arrows, I severed their heads by hundreds. And hard pressed by<br>me, the offspring of Diti, taking shelter within (their) city, soared<br>with it to the firmament, resorting to the illusion proper to the<br>Danavas. Thereupon, O son of the Kurus, covering the way of the Daityas,<br>with a mighty discharge of shafts I obstructed their course. Then by<br>virtue of the bestowal of the boon, the Daityas supported themselves<br>easily on that sky-ranging unearthly aerial city, going anywhere at will<br>and like unto the sun. And now (the city) entered unto the earth and now<br>it rose upwards; and at one time it went in a crooked way and at another<br>time it submerged into water. At this, O represser of foes, I assailed<br>that mighty city, going anywhere at will, and resembling Amaravati. And,<br>O best of the Bharatas, I attacked the city containing those sons of<br>Diti, with multitudes of shafts, displaying celestial weapons. And<br>battered and broken by the straight-coursing iron shafts, shot by me, the<br>city of the Asuras, O king, fell to the earth. And they also, wounded by<br>my iron arrows having the speed of the thunder, began, O monarch, to go<br>about, being urged by destiny. Then ascending to the sky, Matali, as if<br>falling in front, swiftly descended to the earth, on that chariot of<br>solar resplendence. Then, O Bharata, environed me sixty thousand cars<br>belonging to those wrathful ones eager to battle with me. And with<br>sharpened shafts graced with feathers of the vulture, I destroyed those<br>(cars). At this, thinking, 'These our hosts are incapable of being<br>vanquished by mortals, they became engaged in the conflict, like unto the<br>surges of the sea.' Thereupon I gradually began to fix (on the string)<br>unearthly weapons. At this, thousands of weapons (shot) by those<br>wonderfully warring charioteers, by degrees opposed my unearthly arms and<br>in the field I saw hundreds and thousands of mighty (demons) ranging on<br>their cars, in various manoeuvres. And being furnished with variegated<br>mail and standards and diverse ornaments, they delighted my mind. And in<br>the conflict I could not afflict them by showers of shafts, but they did<br>not afflict me. And being afflicted by those innumerable ones, equipped<br>in weapons and skilled in fight, I was pained in that mighty encounter<br>and a terrible fear seized me. Thereupon collecting (my energies) in<br>fight, I (bowed down) unto that god of gods, Raudra, and saying, 'May<br>welfare attend on all beings!' I fixed that mighty weapon which,<br>celebrated under the name of Raudra, is the destroyer of all foes. Then I<br>beheld a male person having three heads, nine eyes, three faces, and six<br>arms. And his hair was flaming like fire or the sun. And, O slayer of<br>foes, for his dress, he had mighty serpents, putting out their tongues.<br>And saying, O best of the Bharatas, the dreadful and eternal Raudra, I<br>being free from fear, set it on the Gandiva; and, bowing unto the<br>three-eyed Sarva of immeasurable energy, let go (the weapon), with the<br>object of vanquishing those foremost of the Danavas, O Bharata. And, O<br>lord of men, as soon as it had been hurled, there appeared on the scene<br>by thousands, forms of deer, and of lions, and of tigers, and of bears<br>and of buffaloes, and of serpents, and of kine, and of sarabhas, and of<br>elephants, and of apes in multitudes, and of bulls, and of boars, and of<br>cats, and of dogs, and of spectres, and of all the Bhurundas, and of<br>vultures, and of Garudas, of chamaras, and of all the leopards, and of<br>mountains, and of seas, and of celestials, and of sages, and of all the<br>Gandharvas, and of ghosts with the Yakshas, and of the haters of the<br>gods, (Asuras), and of the Guhyakas in the field, and of the Nairitas and<br>of elephant-mouthed sharks, and of owls, and of beings having the forms<br>of fishes and horses, and of beings bearing swords and various other<br>weapons, and of Rakshasas wielding maces and clubs. And on that weapon<br>being hurled all the universe became filled with these as well as many<br>others wearing various shapes. And again and again wounded by beings of<br>various sights with (pieces of) flesh, fat, bones, and marrow on their<br>persons,&#8212;some having three heads, and some four tusks, and some four<br>mouths, and some four arms,&#8212;the Danavas met with destruction. And, then,<br>O Bharata, in a moment I slew all those Danavas, with other swarms of<br>arrows composed of the quintessence of stone, flaming like fire or the<br>sun, and possessed of the force of the thunder-bolt. And, seeing them<br>hewn by the Gandiva, and deprived of life, and thrown from the sky, I<br>again bowed unto that god&#8212;the Destroyer of Tripura. And, seeing those<br>adorned with unearthly ornaments, crushed by the weapon, the Raudra, the<br>charioteer of the celestials, experienced the greatest delight. And<br>having witnessed the accomplishment of that unbearable feat incapable of<br>being achieved even by the celestials themselves, Matali, the charioteer<br>of Sakra, paid homage unto me; and well-pleased, with joint hands said<br>these words. 'The feat that hath been achieved by thee, is incapable of<br>being borne even by the gods, nay,&#8212;in battle, the lord of the celestials<br>himself cannot perform this deed. The sky-coursing mighty city incapable<br>of being destroyed by the gods and the Asuras hast thou, O hero, crushed<br>by thy own prowess and by the energy of asceticism. And when that aerial<br>city had been destroyed, and when the Danavas also had been slain, their<br>wives, uttering cries of distress, like unto Kurari birds, with hair<br>dishevelled came out of the city. And bewailing for their sons and<br>brothers and fathers, they fell on the ground and cried with distressful<br>accents. And on being deprived for their lords, they beat their breasts,<br>their garlands and ornaments fallen off. And that city of Danavas, in<br>appearance like unto the city of the Gandharvas filled with lamentations<br>and stricken with dole and distress, and bereft of grace even like unto a<br>lake deprived of (its) elephants, or like unto a forest deprived of trees<br>and (deprived of its) masters, looked no longer beautiful&#8212;but it<br>vanished, like a cloud-constructed city. And when I had accomplished the<br>task, eftsoons from the field Matali took me of delighted spirits, unto<br>the abode of the lord of the celestials. And having slain those mighty<br>Asuras, and destroyed Hiranyapura, and having also killed the<br>Nivata-Kavachas, I came unto Indra. And, O exceedingly resplendent one,<br>as it had fallen out, Matali related in detail unto Devendra that entire<br>achievement of mine. And with the Marutas, hearing of the destruction of<br>Hiranyapura, of the neutralisation of the illusion, and of the slaughter<br>of the highly powerful Nivatakavachas in fight, the prosperous<br>thousand-eyed divine Purandara was well pleased, and exclaimed, 'Well<br>done; Well done!' And the king of the celestials together with the<br>celestials, cheering me again and again, said these sweet words, 'By thee<br>hath been achieved a feat incapable of being achieved by the gods and the<br>Asuras. And, O Partha, by slaying my mighty enemies, thou hast paid the<br>preceptor's fee. And, O Dhananjaya, thus in battle shalt thou always<br>remain calm, and discharge the weapons unerringly, and there shall not<br>stand thee in fight celestials, and Danavas, and Rakshasas, and Yakshas,<br>and Asuras, and Gandharvas and birds and serpents. And, O Kaunteya, by<br>conquering it even by the might of thy arms, Kunti's son Yudhishthira,<br>will rule the earth.'"
