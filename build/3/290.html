                            "Markandeya said, 'It was thus, O mighty-armed one, that Rama of<br>immeasurable energy had suffered of old such excessive calamity in<br>consequence of his exile in the woods! O tiger among men, do not grieve,<br>for, O chastiser of foes, thou art Kshatriya! Thou too treadest in the<br>path in which strength of arms is to be put forth,&#8212;the path that leadeth<br>to tangible rewards. Thou hast not even a particle of sin. Even the<br>celestials with Indra at their head, and the Asuras have to tread in the<br>path that is trod by thee! It was after such afflictions that the wielder<br>of the thunderbolt, aided by the Maruts, slew Vritra, and the invincible<br>Namuchi and the Rakshasi of long tongue! He that hath assistance, always<br>secureth the accomplishment of all his purposes! What is that which<br>cannot be vanquished in battle by him that hath Dhananjaya for his<br>brother? This Bhima, also, of terrible prowess, is the foremost of mighty<br>persons. The heroic and youthful sons of Madravati again are mighty<br>bowmen. With allies such as these, why dost thou despair, O chastiser of<br>foes? These are capable of vanquishing the army of the wielder himself of<br>the thunderbolt with the Maruts in the midst. Having these mighty bowmen<br>of celestial forms for thy allies, thou, O bull of Bharata race, art sure<br>to conquer in battle all thy foes! Behold, this Krishna, the daughter of<br>Drupada, forcibly abducted by the wicked-minded Saindhava from pride of<br>strength and energy, hath been brought back by these mighty warriors<br>after achieving terrible feats! Behold, king Jayadratha was vanquished<br>and lay powerless before thee! The princess of Videha was rescued with<br>almost no allies by Rama after the slaughter in battle of the Ten-necked<br>Rakshasa of terrible prowess! Indeed, the allies of Rama (in that<br>contest) were monkeys and black-faced bears, creatures that were not even<br>human! Think of all this, O king in thy mind! Therefore, O foremost of<br>Kurus, grieve not for all (that hath occurred), O bull of the Bharata<br>race! Illustrious persons like thee never indulge in sorrow, O smiter of<br>foes!'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "It was thus that the king was comforted by<br>Markandeya. And then that high-souled one, casting off his sorrows, once<br>more spoke unto Markandeya."
