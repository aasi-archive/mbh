                            "Markandeya continued, 'Skanda was adorned with a golden amulet and<br>wreath, and wore a crest and a crown of gold; his eyes were<br>golden-coloured, and he had a set of sharp teeth; he was dressed in a red<br>garment and looked very handsome; he had a comely appearance, and was<br>endowed with all good characteristics and was the favourite of the three<br>worlds. He granted boons (to people who sought them) and was brave,<br>youthful, and adorned with bright ear-rings. Whilst he was reposing<br>himself, the goddess of fortune, looking like a lotus and assuming a<br>personal embodiment, rendered her allegiance to him. When he became thus<br>possessed of good fortune, that famous and delicate-looking creature<br>appeared to all like the moon at its full. And high-minded Brahmanas<br>worshipped that mighty being, and the Maharshis (great rishis) then said<br>as follows to Skanda, 'O thou born of the golden egg, mayst thou be<br>prosperous and mayst thou become an instrument of good to the universe! O<br>best of the gods, although thou wast born only six nights (days) ago, the<br>whole world has owned allegiance to thee (within this short time), and<br>thou hast also allayed their fears. Therefore do thou become the Indra<br>(lord) of the three worlds and remove their cause of apprehension.'<br>Skanda replied, 'You gentlemen of great ascetic wealth (tell me) what<br>Indra does with all three worlds and how that sovereign of the celestials<br>protects the hosts of gods unremittingly.' The Rishis replied, 'Indra is<br>the giver of strength, power, children and happiness to all creatures and<br>when propitiated, that Lord of the celestials bestows on all the objects<br>of their desire. He destroys the wicked and fulfils the desires of the<br>righteous; and that Destroyer of Vala assigns to all creatures their<br>various duties. He officiates for the sun and the moon in places where<br>there is no sun or moon; he even when occasion requires it, acts for<br>(serves the purposes of) fire, air, earth, and water. These are the<br>duties of Indra; his capacities are immense. Thou too art mighty;<br>therefore great hero, do thou become our Indra.'<br><br>Sakra said, 'O mighty being, do thou make us happy, by becoming our lord.<br>Excellent being, thou art worthy of the honour; therefore shall we anoint<br>thee this very day.'<br><br>Skanda replied, 'Do thou continue to rule the three worlds with<br>self-possession, and with thy heart bent on conquest. I shall remain thy<br>humble servant. I covet not thy sovereignty.'<br><br>Sakra replied, 'Thy prowess is unrivalled, O hero, do thou therefore<br>vanquish the enemies of the gods. People have been struck with wonder at<br>thy prowess. More specially as I have been bereft of my prowess, and<br>defeated by thee, now if I were to act as Indra, I should not command the<br>respect of all creatures, and they would be busy in bringing about<br>dissensions between us; and then, my lord, they would become the<br>partisans of one or other of us. And when they formed themselves into two<br>distinct factions, war as before would be the result of that defection.<br>And in that war, thou wouldst undoubtedly defeat me without difficulty<br>and thyself become the lord of all worlds.'<br><br>Skanda replied, 'Thou, O Sakra, art my sovereign, as also of the three<br>worlds; mayst thou be prosperous! Tell me if I can obey any commands of<br>thine.'<br><br>Indra replied, 'At thy bidding, O powerful being, I shall continue to act<br>as Indra. And if thou hast said this deliberately and in earnest, then<br>hear me how thou canst gratify thy desire of serving me. Do thou, O<br>mighty being, take the leadership of the celestial forces accordingly.'<br><br>Skanda replied, 'Do thou anoint me as leader, for the destruction of the<br>Danavas, for the good of the celestials, and for the well-being of cows<br>and Brahmanas.'<br><br>Markandeya continued, "Thus anointed by Indra and all other gods, and<br>honoured by the Maharshis, he looked grand at the moment. The golden<br>umbrella[77] held (over his head) looked like a halo of blazing fire.<br>That famous god, the Conqueror of Tripura, himself fastened the celestial<br>wreath of gold, of Viswakarma's manufacture, round his neck. And, O great<br>man and conqueror of thine enemies, that worshipful god with the emblem<br>of the bull, had gone there previously with Parvati. He honoured him with<br>a joyous heart. The Fire-god is called Rudra by Brahmanas, and from this<br>fact Skanda is called the son of Rudra. The White Mountain was formed<br>from discharges of Rudra's semen virile and the sensual indulgences of<br>the Fire-god with the Krittikas took place on that same White Mountain.<br>And as Rudra was seen by all the dwellers of heaven to heap honours on<br>the excellent Guha (Skanda), he was for that reason reputed as the son of<br>Rudra. This child had his being by the action of Rudra entering into the<br>constitution of the Fire-god, and for this reason, Skanda came to be<br>known as the son of Rudra. And, O Bharata, as Rudra, the Fire-god, Swaha,<br>and the six wives (of the seven Rishis) were instrumental to the birth of<br>the great god Skanda, he was for that reason reputed as the son of Rudra.<br><br>"That son of Fire-god was clad in a pair of clean red cloths, and thus he<br>looked grand and resplendent like the Sun peeping forth from behind a<br>mass of red clouds. And the red cock given to him by the Fire-god, formed<br>his ensign; and when perched on the top of his chariot, it looked like<br>the image of the all-destroying fire. And the presiding deity of the<br>power which conduces to the victory of the god, and which is the director<br>of the exertions of all creatures, and constitutes their glory, prop and<br>refuge, advanced before him. And a mysterious charm entered into his<br>constitution the charm which manifests its powers on the battlefield.<br>Beauty, strength, piety, power, might, truthfulness, rectitude, devotion<br>to Brahmanas, freedom from illusion or perplexity, protection of<br>followers, destruction of foes, and care of all creatures,&#8212;these, O lord<br>of men, are the inborn virtues of Skanda. Thus anointed by all the gods,<br>he looked pleased and complacent; and dressed in his best style, he<br>looked beautiful like the moon at its full. The much-esteemed incantation<br>of Vedic hymns, the music of the celestial band, and the songs of gods<br>and Gandharvas then rang on all sides. And surrounded by all the<br>well-dressed Apsaras, and many other gay and happy-looking Pisachas and<br>hosts of gods, that anointed (by gods) son of Pavaka disported himself in<br>all his grandeur. To the dwellers of heaven, the anointed Mahasena,<br>appeared like the Sun rising after extinction of darkness. And then the<br>celestial forces looking upon him as their leader, surrounded him on all<br>sides in thousands. That adorable being followed by all creatures then<br>assumed their commands, and praised and honoured by them, he encouraged<br>them in return.<br><br>"The Performer of a thousand sacrifices then thought of Devasena, whom he<br>has rescued before. And considering that this being (Skanda) was<br>undoubtedly destined to be the husband of this lady by Brahma himself, he<br>had her brought there, dressed her with the best apparel. And the<br>vanquisher of Vala then said to Skanda, 'O foremost of gods, this lady<br>was, even before thy birth, destined to be thy bride by that<br>Self-existent Being.[78] Therefore do thou duly accept her lotus-like<br>beautiful right hand with invocation of the (marital) hymns.' Thus told,<br>he duly married her. And Vrihaspati learned in hymns performed the<br>necessary prayers and oblations. She who is called Shashthi, Lakshmi,<br>Asa, Sukhaprada, Sinivali, Kuhu, Saivritti, and Aparajita, is known among<br>men as Devasena, the wife of Skanda. When Skanda became united to<br>Devasena in indissoluble bonds of matrimony, then the gods of prosperity<br>in her own personal embodiment began to serve him with diligence. As<br>Skanda attained celebrity on the fifth lunar day, that day is called<br>Sripanchami (or the auspicious fifth day) and as he attained his object<br>on the sixth, that lunar day is considered to be of great moment."
