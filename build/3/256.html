                            Janamejaya said, 'After having delivered Duryodhana, what did the mighty<br>sons of Pandu do in that forest? It behoveth thee to tell me this.'<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Once on a time, as Yudhishthira lay down at night in<br>the Dwaita woods, some deer, with accents choked in tears, presented<br>themselves before him in his dreams. To them standing with joined hands,<br>their bodies trembling all over that foremost of monarchs said, 'Tell me<br>what ye wish to say. Who are ye? And what do ye desire?' Thus accosted by<br>Kunti's son&#8212;the illustrious Pandava, those deer, the remnant of those<br>that had been slaughtered, replied unto him, saying, 'We are, O Bharata,<br>those deer that are still alive after them that had been slaughtered. We<br>shall be exterminated totally. Therefore, do thou change thy residence. O<br>mighty king, all thy brothers are heroes, conversant with weapons; they<br>have thinned the ranks of the rangers of the forest. We few&#8212;the<br>remnants,&#8212;O mighty-minded one, remain like seed. By thy favour, O king<br>of kings, let us increase.' Seeing these deer, which remained like seed<br>after the rest had been destroyed trembling and afflicted with fear,<br>Yudhishthira the just was greatly affected with grief. And the king,<br>intent on the welfare of all creatures, said unto them, 'So be it. I<br>shall act as ye have said.' Awaking after such a vision, that excellent<br>king, moved by pity towards the deer, thus spake unto his brothers<br>assembled there, 'Those deer that are alive after them that have been<br>slaughtered, accosted me at night, after I had awakened, saying, 'We<br>remain like the cues of our lines. Blest be thou! Do thou have compassion<br>on us.' And they have spoken truly. We ought to feel pity for the<br>dwellers of the forest. We have been feeding on them for a year together<br>and eight months. Let us, therefore, again (repair) to the romantic<br>Kamyakas, that best of forests abounding in wild animals, situated at the<br>head of the desert, near lake Trinavindu. And there let us pleasantly<br>pass the rest of our time.' Then, O king, the Pandavas versed in<br>morality, swiftly departed (thence), accompanied by the Brahmanas and all<br>those that lived with them, and followed by Indrasena and other<br>retainers. And proceeding along the roads walked (by travellers),<br>furnished with excellent corn and clear water, they at length beheld the<br>sacred asylum of Kamyaka endued with ascetic merit. And as pious men<br>enter the celestial regions, those foremost of the Bharata race, the<br>Kauravas, surrounded by those bulls among Brahmanas entered that forest."
