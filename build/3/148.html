                            Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed, the powerful Bhimasena of mighty<br>arms, affectionately, and with a cheerful heart, bowed unto his brother,<br>Hanuman, the monkey-chief, and said in mild words, 'None is more<br>fortunate than I am; now have I seen my elder brother. It is a great<br>favour shown unto me; and I have been well pleased with thee. Now I wish<br>that thou mayst fulfil this desire of mine. I desire to behold. O hero,<br>that incomparable form of thine, which thou at that time hadst had, in<br>bounding over the main, that abode of sharks and crocodiles. Thereby I<br>shall be satisfied, and also believe in thy words.' Thus addressed, that<br>mighty monkey said with a smile, 'That form of mine neither thou, not any<br>one else can behold. At that age, the state of things was different, and<br>doth not exist at present. In the Krita age, the state of things was one;<br>and in the Treta, another; and in the Dwapara, still another. Diminution<br>is going on this age; and I have not that form now. The ground, rivers,<br>plants, and rocks, and siddhas, gods, and celestial sages conform to<br>Time, in harmony with the state of things in the different yugas.<br>Therefore, do not desire to see my former shape, O perpetuator of the<br>Kuru race. I am conforming to the tendency of the age. Verily, Time is<br>irresistible' Bhimasena said, 'Tell me of the duration of the different<br>yugas, and of the different manners and customs and of virtue, pleasure<br>and profit, and of acts, and energy, and of life and death in the<br>different yugas.' Thereupon Hanuman said, 'O child, that yuga is called<br>Krita when the one eternal religion was extant. And in that best of<br>yugas, every one had religious perfection, and, therefore, there was no<br>need of religious acts. And then virtue knew no deterioration; nor did<br>people decrease. It is for this that this age is called Krita (perfect).<br>But in time the yuga had come to be considered as an inferior one. And, O<br>child, in the Krita age, there were neither gods, nor demons, nor<br>Gandharvas, nor Yakshas, nor Rakshasas, nor Nagas. And there was no<br>buying and selling. And the Sama, the Rich, and the Yajus did not exist.<br>And there was no manual labour. And then the necessaries of life were<br>obtained only by being thought of. And the only merit was in renouncing<br>the world. And during that yuga, there was neither disease, nor decay of<br>the senses. And there was neither malice, nor pride, nor hypocrisy, nor<br>discord, nor ill-will, nor cunning, nor fear, nor misery, nor envy, nor<br>covetousness. And for this, that prime refuge of Yogis, even the Supreme<br>Brahma, was attainable to all. And Narayana wearing a white hue was the<br>soul of all creatures. And in the Krita Yuga, the distinctive<br>characteristics of Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras were<br>natural and these ever stuck to their respective duties. And then Brahma<br>was the sole refuge, and their manners and customs were naturally adapted<br>to the attainment of Brahma and the objects of their knowledge was the<br>sole Brahma, and all their acts also had reference to Brahma. In this way<br>all the orders attained merit. And one uniform Soul was the object of<br>their meditation; and there was only one mantra (the Om), and there was<br>one ordinance. And although of different characteristics, all of them<br>followed a single Veda; and they had one religion. And according to the<br>divisions of time, they led the four modes of life, without aiming at any<br>object, and so they attained emancipation. The religion consisting in the<br>identification of self with Brahma indicates the Krita Yuga. And in the<br>Krita Yuga, the virtue of the four orders is throughout entire in<br>four-fold measure. Such is the Krita Yuga devoid of the three qualities.<br>Do thou also hear from me of the character of the Treta Yuga. In this<br>age, sacrifices are introduced, and virtue decreaseth by a quarter. And<br>Narayana (who is the Soul of all creatures) assumeth a red colour. And<br>men practise truth, and devote themselves to religion and religious<br>rites. And thence sacrifices and various religious observances come into<br>existence. And in the Treta Yuga people begin to devise means for the<br>attainment of an object; and they attain it through acts and gifts. And<br>they never deviate from virtue. And they are devoted to asceticism and to<br>the bestowal of gifts. And the four orders adhere to their respective<br>duties; and perform rites. Such are the men of the Treta Yuga. In the<br>Dwapara Yuga, religion decreaseth by one half. And Narayana weareth a<br>yellow hue. And the Veda becometh divided into four parts. And then some<br>men retain (the knowledge of) the four Vedas, and some of three Vedas,<br>and some of one Veda, while others do not know even the Richs. And on the<br>Shastras becoming thus divided, acts become multiplied. And largely<br>influenced by passion, people engage in asceticism and gifts. And from<br>their incapacity to study the entire Veda, it becomes divided into<br>several parts. And in consequence of intellect having decreased, few are<br>established in truth. And when people fall off from truth, they become<br>subject to various diseases; and then lust, and natural calamities ensue.<br>And afflicted with these, people betake themselves to penances. And some<br>celebrate sacrifices, desiring to enjoy the good things of life, or<br>attain heaven. On the coming of the Dwapara Yuga, men become degenerate,<br>in consequence of impiety. O son of Kunti, in the Kali Yuga a quarter<br>only of virtue abideth. And in the beginning of this iron age, Narayana<br>weareth a black hue. And the Vedas and the institutes, and virtue, and<br>sacrifices, and religious observances, fall into disuse. And (then) reign<br>iti[41], and disease, and lassitude, and anger and other deformities, and<br>natural calamities, and anguish, and fear of scarcity. And as the yugas<br>wane, virtue dwindles. And as virtue dwindles away, creatures degenerate.<br>And as creatures degenerate, their natures undergo deterioration. And the<br>religious acts performed at the waning of the yugas, produce contrary<br>effects. And even those that live for several yugas, conform to these<br>changes. O represser of foes, as regards thy curiosity to know me, I say<br>this,&#8212;Why should a wise person be eager to know a superfluous matter?<br>(Thus), O long-armed one, have I narrated in full what thou hadst asked<br>me regarding the characteristics of the different yugas. Good happen to<br>thee! Do thou return.'"
