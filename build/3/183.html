                            Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"The sons of Pandu said to the high-souled<br>Markandeya, 'We long to hear of the greatness of the Brahmanas Do thou<br>tell us of it!' Thus asked, the revered Markandeya, of austere virtue and<br>high spiritual energy, and proficient in all departments of knowledge,<br>replied, 'A strong-limbed, handsome young prince of the race of the<br>Haihayas, a conqueror of hostile cities, (once) went out hunting. And<br>(while) roaming in the wilderness of big trees and thickets of grass, he<br>saw, at no great distance from him, a Muni with the skin of a black<br>antelope for his upper garment, and killed him for a deer. Pained at what<br>he had done, and his senses paralysed with grief, he repaired to the<br>presence of the more distinguished of the Haihaya chiefs. The louts-eyed<br>prince related to them the particulars. On hearing the account, O my son,<br>and beholding the body of the Muni who had subsisted on fruits and roots,<br>they were sorely afflicted in mind. And they all set out enquiring here<br>and there as they proceeded, as to whose son the Muni might be. And they<br>soon after reached the hermitage of Arishtanemi, son of Kasyapa. And<br>saluting that great Muni, so constant in austerity, they all remained<br>standing, while the Muni, on his part, busied himself about their<br>reception. And they said unto the illustrious Muni, 'By a freak of<br>destiny, we have ceased to merit thy welcome: indeed, we have killed a<br>Brahmana!' And the regenerate Rishi said to them, 'How hath a Brahmana<br>come to be killed by you, and say where may be he? Do ye all witness the<br>power of my ascetic practices!' And they, having related everything to<br>him as it had happened went back, but found not the body of the dead<br>Rishi on the spot (where they had left it). And having searched for him,<br>they returned, ashamed and bereft of all perception, as in a dream. And<br>then, O thou conqueror of hostile cities, the Muni Tarkshya, addressed<br>them, saying, 'Ye princes, can this be the Brahmana of your killing? This<br>Brahmana, endowed with occult gifts from spiritual exercises, is, indeed,<br>my son!' Seeing that Rishi, O lord of the earth, they were struck with<br>bewilderment. And they said, 'What a marvel! How hath the dead come to<br>life again? Is it the power of his austere virtue by which he hath<br>revived again? We long to hear this, O Brahmana, if, indeed, it can be<br>divulged?' To them, he replied, 'Death, O lords of men, hath no power<br>over us! I shall tell ye the reason briefly and intelligibly. We perform<br>our own sacred duties; therefore, have we no fear of death; we speak well<br>of Brahmanas but never think any ill of them; therefore hath death no<br>terror for us. Entertaining our guests with food and drink, and our<br>dependants with plenty of food, we ourselves (then) partake of what is<br>left; therefore we are not afraid of death. We are peaceful and austere<br>and charitable and forbearing and fond of visiting sacred shrines, and we<br>live in sacred places; therefore we have no fear of death. And we live in<br>places inhabited by men who have great spiritual power; therefore hath<br>death no terror for us. I have briefly told ye all! Return ye now all<br>together, cured of all worldly vanity. Ye have no fear of sin!' Saying<br>amen, O foremost scion of Bharata's race, and saluting the great Muni,<br>all those princes joyously returned to their country."
