                            "Vrihadaswa said, 'When the blazing guardians of the worlds were<br>returning after the daughter of Bhima had chosen Naishadha, on their way<br>they met Dwapara with Kali approaching towards them. And seeing Kali,<br>Sakra the slayer of Vala and Vritra, said, 'O Kali, say whither thou art<br>going with Dwapara.' And thereupon Kali replied unto Sakra, 'Going to<br>Damayanti's Swayamvara, will I obtain her (for my wife), as my heart is<br>fixed upon that damsel.' Hearing this, Indra said with a smile, 'That<br>Swayamvara is already ended. In our sight she hath chosen Nala for her<br>husband.' Thus answered by Sakra, Kali, that vilest of the celestials,<br>filled with wrath, addressing all those gods spake, 'Since in the<br>presence of the celestials she hath chosen a mortal for her lord, it is<br>meet that she should undergo a heavy doom.' Upon hearing these words of<br>Kali, the celestials answered, 'It is with our sanction that Damayanti<br>hath chosen Nala. What damsel is there that would not choose king Nala<br>endued with every virtue? Well-versed in all duties, always conducting<br>himself with rectitude, he hath studied the four Vedas together with the<br>Puranas that are regarded as the fifth. Leading a life of harmlessness<br>unto all creatures, he is truth-telling and firm in his vows, and in his<br>house the gods are ever gratified by sacrifices held according to the<br>ordinance. In that tiger among men&#8212;that king resembling a Lokapala, is<br>truth, and forbearance, and knowledge, and asceticism, and purity and<br>self-control, and perfect tranquillity of soul. O Kali, the fool that<br>wisheth to curse Nala bearing such a character, curseth himself, and<br>destroyeth himself by his own act. And, O Kali, he that seeketh to curse<br>Nala crowned with such virtues, sinketh into the wide bottomless pit of<br>hell rife with torments.' Having said this to Kali and Dwapara, the gods<br>went to heaven. And when the gods had gone away, Kali said unto Dwapara,<br>'I am ill able, O Dwapara, to suppress my anger. I shall possess Nala,<br>deprive him of his kingdom, and he shall no more sport with Bhima's<br>daughter. Entering the dice, it behoveth thee to help me.'"
