                            "Surya said, 'Never do, O Karna, anything that is harmful to thy self and<br>thy friends; thy sons, thy wives, thy father, and thy mother; O thou best<br>of those that bear life, people desire renown (in this world) and lasting<br>fame in heaven, without wishing to sacrifice their bodies. But as thou<br>desirest undying fame at the expense of thy life, she will, without<br>doubt, snatch away thy life! O bull among men, in this world, the father,<br>the mother, the son, and other relatives are of use only to him that is<br>alive. O tiger among men, as regard kings, it is only when they are alive<br>that prowess can be of any use to them. Do thou understand this? O thou<br>of exceeding splendour, fame is for the good of these only that are<br>alive! Of what use is fame to the dead whose bodies have been reduced to<br>ashes? One that is dead cannot enjoy renown. It is only when one is alive<br>that one can enjoy it. The fame of one that is dead is like a garland of<br>flowers around the neck of a corpse. As thou reverest me, I tell thee<br>this for thy benefit, because thou art a worshipper of mine! They that<br>worship me are always protected by me. That also is another reason for my<br>addressing thee thus! Thinking again, O mighty-armed one, that this one<br>revereth me with great reverence, I have been inspired with love for<br>thee! Do thou, therefore, act according to my words! There is, besides<br>some profound mystery in all this, ordained by fate. It is for this, that<br>I tell thee so. Do thou act without mistrust of any kind! O bull among<br>men, it is not fit for thee to know this which is a secret to the very<br>gods. Therefore, I do not reveal that secret unto thee. Thou wilt,<br>however, understand it in time. I repeat what I have already said. Do<br>thou, O Radha's son, lay my words to heart! When the wielder of the<br>thunder-bolt asketh thee for them, do thou never give him thy ear-rings!<br>O thou of exceeding splendour, with thy handsome ear-rings, thou lookest<br>beautiful, even like the Moon himself in the clear firmament, between the<br>Visakha constellation! Dost thou know that fame availeth only the person<br>that is living. Therefore, when the lord of the celestials will ask the<br>ear-rings, thou shouldst, O son, refuse him! Repeating again and again<br>answers fraught with various reasons, thou wilt, O sinless one, be able<br>to remove the eagerness of the lord of the celestial for the possession<br>of the ear-rings. Do thou, O Karna, after Purandara's purpose by urging<br>answers fraught with reason and grave import and adorned with sweetness<br>and suavity. Thou dost always, O tiger among men, challenge him that can<br>draw the bow with his left hand, and heroic Arjuna also will surely<br>encounter thee in fight. But when furnished with thy ear-rings, Arjuna<br>will never be able to vanquish thee in fight even if Indra himself comes<br>to his assistance. Therefore, O Karna, if thou wishest to vanquish Arjuna<br>in battle, these handsome ear-rings of thine should never be parted with<br>to Sakra.'"
