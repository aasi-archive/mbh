                            Vaisampayana said, "After this the royal son of Kunti who was ever<br>distinguished for his profuse gifts unto Brahmanas, proceeded to the<br>asylum of Agastya and took up his abode in Durjaya. It was here that that<br>foremost of speakers, king Yudhishthira asked Lomasa as to why Agastya<br>had slain Vatapi there. And the king also enquired after the extent of<br>that man-destroying Daitya's prowess, and the reason also of the<br>illustrious Agastya's wrath being excited against that Asura.<br><br>"Thus questioned, Lomasa said, 'O son of Kuru race, there was in the city<br>called Manimati, in days of yore, a Daitya named Ilwala, whose younger<br>brother was Vatapi. One day that son of Diti addressed the Brahmana<br>endued with ascetic merit, saying, 'O holy one, grant me a son equal unto<br>Indra.' The Brahmana, however, did not grant the Asura a son like Indra.<br>And at this, the Asura was inflamed with wrath against the Brahmana. And<br>from that day, O king, the Asura Ilwala became a destroyer of Brahmanas.<br>And endued with power of illusion the angry Asura transformed his brother<br>into a ram. And Vatapi also capable of assuming any form at will, would<br>immediately assume the shape of a ram. And the flesh of that ram, after<br>being properly dressed, was offered to Brahmanas as food. And after they<br>had eaten of it, they were slain. For whomsoever Ilwala summoned with his<br>voice, he would come back to Ilwala even if he had gone to the abode of<br>Yama, in re-embodied form endued with life, and show himself to Ilwala.<br>And so having transformed the Asura Vatapi into a ram and properly cooked<br>his flesh and feeding Brahmanas therewith, he would summon Vatapi. And<br>the mighty Asura Vatapi, that foe of Brahmanas, endued with great<br>strength and power of illusion, hearing, O king, those sounds uttered<br>with a loud voice by Ilwala, and ripping open the flanks of the Brahmana<br>would come laughingly out, O lord of earth! And it was thus, O monarch,<br>that the wicked-hearted Daitya Ilwala, having fed Brahmanas, frequently<br>took away their lives.<br><br>"Meanwhile, the illustrious Agastya beheld his deceased ancestors hanging<br>in a pit with heads downwards. And he asked those personages thus<br>suspended in that hole, saying, 'What is the matter with you? Thus<br>questioned those utterers of Brahma replied, 'It is even for offspring.'<br>And they also told him, 'We are your ancestors. It is even for offspring<br>that we stay suspended in this pit. If O Agastya, thou canst beget us a<br>good son, we may then be saved from this hell and thou also wilt obtain<br>thy blessed state of those having offspring.' Endued with great energy<br>and observant of truth and morality Agastya replied, saying, 'Ye Pitris,<br>I will accomplish your desire. Let this anxiety of yours be dispelled.'<br>And the illustrious Rishi then began to think of perpetuating his race.<br>But he saw not a wife worthy of him on whom he himself could take his<br>birth in the form of a son. The Rishi accordingly, taking those parts<br>that were regarded as highly beautiful, from creatures possessing them,<br>created therewith an excellent woman. And the Muni, endued with great<br>ascetic merit, thereupon gave that girl created for himself to the king<br>of the Vidharbhas who was then undergoing ascetic penances for obtaining<br>offspring. And that blessed girl of sweet face (thus disposed of) then<br>took her birth (in Vidarbha's royal line) and, beautiful as the effulgent<br>lightning, her limbs began to grow day by day. And as soon as that lord<br>of earth&#8212;the ruler of the Vidarbhas&#8212;saw her ushered into life, he<br>joyfully communicated the intelligence, O Bharata, unto the Brahmanas.<br>And the Brahmanas thereupon, O lord of earth, blessed the girl and they<br>bestowed upon her the name Lopamudra. And possessed of great beauty, she<br>began, O monarch, to grow quickly like unto a lotus in the midst of water<br>or the effulgent flame of a fire. And when the girl grew and attained to<br>puberty, a hundred virgins decked in ornaments and a hundred maids waited<br>in obedience upon her blessed self. And surrounded by those hundred maids<br>and virgins, she shone in their midst, endued as she was with bright<br>effulgence, like Rohini in the firmament amid an inferior multitude of<br>stars. And possessed as she was of good behaviour and excellent manners,<br>none dared ask for her hand even when she attained to puberty, through<br>fear of her father, the king of the Vidharbhas. And Lopamudra, devoted to<br>truth, surpassing the Apsaras even in beauty, gratified her father and<br>relatives by means of her conduct. And her father, beholding his<br>daughter-the princess of Vidharbha-attain to puberty, began to reflect in<br>his mind, saying, 'To whom should I give this daughter of mine?'"
