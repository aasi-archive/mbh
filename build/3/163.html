                            Vaisampayana continued, "Dwelling in that best of mountains those<br>high-souled ones observing excellent vows, felt themselves attracted (to<br>that place), and diverted themselves, eager to behold Arjuna. And<br>multitudes of Gandharvas and Maharshis gladly visited those energetic<br>ones, possessing prowess, of chaste desires and being the foremost of<br>those endued with truth and fortitude. And having arrived at that<br>excellent mountain furnished with trees bearing blossoms, those mighty<br>charioteers were exceedingly delighted, even as the Marutas, on arriving<br>at the celestial regions. And experiencing great exhilaration, they lived<br>(there), seeing the slopes and summits of that mighty mountain, filled<br>with flowers, and resonant with the cries of peacocks and cranes. And on<br>that beautiful mountain they beheld lakes filled with lotuses, and having<br>their shores covered with trees, and frequented by darkness, and<br>karandavas and swans. And the flourishing sporting-regions, graceful on<br>account of the various flowers, and abounding in gems, was capable of<br>captivating that king, the dispenser of wealth (Kuvera). And always<br>ranging (there), those foremost of ascetics (the Pandavas) were incapable<br>of conceiving (the significance of) that Summit, furnished with mighty<br>trees, and masses of wide-spreading clouds. And, O great hero, owing to<br>its native splendour, and also on account of the brilliance of the annual<br>plants, there was no difference there between night and day. And staying<br>in the mountain, remaining in which the Sun of unrivalled energy<br>cherisheth the mobile and immobile things, those heroes and foremost of<br>men beheld the rising and the setting of the Sun. And having seen the<br>rising and the setting points of the Sun and the rising and the setting<br>mountain, and all the cardinal points, as well as the intervening spaces<br>ever blazing with the rays of the Dispeller of darkness, those heroes, in<br>expectation of the arrival of that mighty charioteer firm in truth,<br>became engaged in reciting the Vedas, practising the daily rituals,<br>chiefly discharging the religious duties, exercising sacred vows, and<br>abiding by the truth. And saying, 'Let us even here experience delight by<br>joining without delay Arjuna accomplished in arms,' those highly blessed<br>Parthas became engaged in the practice of Yoga. And beholding romantic<br>woods on that mountain, as they always thought of Kiriti, every day and<br>night appeared unto them even as a year. From that very moment joy had<br>taken leave of them when, with Dhaumya's permission, the high-souled<br>Jishnu, matting his hair, departed (for the woods). So, how could they,<br>absorbed in his contemplation, experience happiness there? They had<br>become overwhelmed with grief ever since the moment when at the command<br>of his brother, Yudhishthira, Jishnu of the tread of a mad elephant had<br>departed from the Kamyaka forest. O Bharata, in this way, on that<br>mountain those descendants of Bharata passed a month with difficulty,<br>thinking of him of the white steeds, who had gone to Vasava's abode for<br>learning arms. And Arjuna, having dwelt for five years in the abode of<br>him of a thousand eyes, and having from that lord of celestials obtained<br>all the celestial weapons,&#8212;such as those of Agni, of Varuna, of Soma, of<br>Vayu, of Vishnu, of Indra, of Pasupati, of Brahma, of Parameshthi, of<br>Prajapati, of Yama, of Dhata, of Savita, of Tvashta, and of Vaisravana;<br>and having bowed down to and gone round him of a hundred sacrifices, and<br>taken his (Indra's) permission, cheerfully came to the Gandhamadana."
