                            Vaisampayana said, "When the high-souled sons of Pandu had proceeded only<br>two miles, Draupadi unaccustomed to travel on foot, sank down. Weary and<br>afflicted as she was, the poor daughter of Panchala became faint, on<br>account of the hailstorm and also of her extreme delicacy. And trembling<br>with faintness, the black-eyed one supported herself on her thighs with<br>her plump arms, becoming (her graceful form). And thus resting for<br>support on her thighs resembling the trunk of an elephant, and which were<br>in contract with each other, she suddenly dropped upon the ground,<br>trembling like a plantain tree. And finding that the beautiful one was<br>falling down like a twisted creeper, Nakula ran forward and supported,<br>her. And he said, 'O king, this black-eyed daughter of Panchala, being<br>weary, hath fallen down upon the ground. Do thou, therefore, tend her, O<br>son of Bharata. Undeserving as she is of misery, this lady of slow pace<br>hath been subject to great hardships, and she is also worn out with the<br>fatigues of the journey. O mighty king, do thou therefore, comfort her.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Having heard these words of Nakula, the king as also<br>Bhima and Sahadeva, became sorely afflicted, and hastily ran towards her.<br>And finding her weak, and her countenance pale, the pious son of Kunti<br>began to lament in grief, taking her on his lap. Yudhishthira said.<br>'Accustomed to ease, and deserving to sleep in wellprotected rooms, on<br>beds spread over with fine sheets, how doth this beautiful one sleep<br>prostrate on the ground! Alas! On my account (alone), the delicate feet<br>and the lotus-like face of this one deserving of all excellent things,<br>have contracted a dark-blue hue. O what have I done! Fool that I am,<br>having been addicted to dice, I have been wandering in the forest full of<br>wild beasts, taking Krishna in my company. This large-eyed one had been<br>bestowed by her father, the king of the Drupadas, in the hope that the<br>blessed girl would be happy, by obtaining the sons of Pandu for her<br>lords. It is on account of my wretched self, that without obtaining<br>anything hoped for, she sleepeth prostrate on the ground, tired with<br>hardships, sorrow and travel!"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "While king Yudhishthira the just was lamenting thus,<br>Dhaumya with all the other principal Brahmanas came to the spot. And they<br>began to console him and to honour him with blessings. And they recited<br>mantras capable of dispelling Rakshasas and (to that end) also performed<br>rites. And on the mantras being recited by the great ascetics, in order<br>to the restoration of (Panchali's) health, Panchali frequently touched by<br>the Pandavas with their soothing palms and fanned by cool breezes<br>surcharged with particles of water, felt ease, and gradually regained her<br>senses. And finding that exhausted poor lady restored to her senses, the<br>sons of Pritha, placing her on deer-skin, caused her to take rest. And<br>taking her feet of red soles, bearing auspicious marks, the twins began<br>to press them gently with their hands, scarred by the bow-string. And<br>Yudhishthira the just, the foremost of the Kurus, also comforted her and<br>addressed Bhima in the following words: 'O Bhima, there yet remain many<br>mountains (before us), rugged, and inaccessible because of snow. How,<br>long-armed one, will Krishna pass over them?' Thereupon Bhima said, 'O<br>king, I myself shall carry thee, together with this princess and these<br>bulls among men, the twins; therefore, O king of kings, resign not thy<br>mind unto despair. Or, at thy bidding, O sinless one, Hidimava's son, the<br>mighty Ghatotkacha, who is capable of ranging the skies and who is like<br>unto me in strength, will carry us all.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Then with Yudhishthira's permission, Bhima thought of<br>his Rakshasa son. And no sooner was he thought of by his father, than the<br>pious Ghatotkacha made his appearance and, saluting the Pandavas and the<br>Brahmanas, stood with joined hands. And they also caressed him of mighty<br>arms. He then addressed his father, Bhimasena of dreadful prowess,<br>saying, 'Having been thought of by thee I have come here with speed, in<br>order to serve thee. Do thou, O longarmed one, command me. I shall<br>certainly be able to perform whatever thou bidst.' Hearing this,<br>Bhimasena hugged the Rakshasa to his breast."
