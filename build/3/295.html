                            "Markandeya said, The powerful Satyavan then, accompanied by his wife,<br>plucked fruits and filled his wallet with them. And he then began to fell<br>branches of trees. And as he was hewing them, he began to perspire. And<br>in consequence of that exercise his head began to ache. And afflicted<br>with toil, he approached his beloved wife, and addressed her, saying, 'O<br>Savitri, owing to this hard exercise my head acheth, and all my limbs and<br>my heart also are afflicted sorely! O thou of restrained speech, I think<br>myself unwell, I feel as if my head is being pierced with numerous darts.<br>Therefore, O auspicious lady, I wish to sleep, for I have not the power<br>to stand.' Hearing these words, Savitri quickly advancing, approached her<br>husband, and sat down upon the ground, placing his head upon her lap. And<br>that helpless lady, thinking of Narada's words, began to calculate the<br>(appointed) division of the day, the hour, and the moment. The next<br>moment she saw a person clad in red attire with his head decked with a<br>diadem. And his body was of large proportions and effulgent as the Sun.<br>And he was of a darkish hue, had red eyes, carried a noose in his hand,<br>and was dreadful to behold. And he was standing beside Satyavan and was<br>steadfastly gazing at him. And seeing him, Savitri gently placed her<br>husband's head on the ground, and rising suddenly, with a trembling<br>heart, spake these words in distressful accents, 'Seeing this thy<br>superhuman form, I take thee to be a deity. If thou will, tell me, O<br>chief of the gods, who thou art and what also thou intendst to do!'<br>Thereat, Yama replied, 'O Savitri, thou art ever devoted to thy husband,<br>and thou art also endued with ascetic merit. It is for this reason that I<br>hold converse with thee. Do thou, O auspicious one, know me for Yama.<br>This thy lord Satyavan, the son of a king, hath his days run out. I<br>shall, therefore, take him away binding him in this noose. Know this to<br>be my errand!' At these words Savitri said, 'I had heard that thy<br>emissaries come to take away mortals, O worshipful one! Why then, O lord,<br>hast thou come in person?'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Thus addressed by her, the illustrious lord of<br>Pitris, with a view to oblige her, began to unfold to her truly all about<br>his intentions. And Yama said, 'This prince is endued with virtues and<br>beauty of person, and is a sea of accomplishments. He deserveth not to be<br>borne away by my emissaries. Therefore is it that I have come<br>personally.' Saying this, Yama by main force pulled out of the body of<br>Satyavan, a person of the measure of the thumb, bound in noose and<br>completely under subjection. And when Satyavan's life had thus been taken<br>out, the body, deprived of breath, and shorn of lustre, and destitute of<br>motion, became unsightly to behold. And binding Satyavan's vital essence,<br>Yama proceeded in a southerly direction. Thereupon, with heart<br>overwhelmed in grief, the exalted Savitri, ever devoted to her lord and<br>crowned with success in respect of her vows, began to follow Yama. And at<br>this, Yama said, 'Desist, O Savitri! Go back, and perform the funeral<br>obsequies of thy lord! Thou art freed from all thy obligations to thy<br>lord. Thou hast come as far as it is possible to come'. Savitri replied,<br>'Whither my husband is being carried, or whither he goeth of his own<br>accord, I will follow him thither. This is the eternal custom. By virtue<br>of my asceticism, of my regard for my superiors, of my affection for my<br>lord, of my observance of vows, as well as of thy favour, my course is<br>unimpeded. It hath been declared by wise men endued with true knowledge<br>that by walking only seven paces with another, one contracteth a<br>friendship with one's companion. Keeping that friendship (which I have<br>contracted with thee) in view, I shall speak to thee something. Do thou<br>listen to it. They that have not their souls under control, acquire not<br>merit by leading the four successive modes of life, viz.,&#8212;celibacy with<br>study, domesticity, retirement into the woods, and renunciation of the<br>world. That which is called religious merit is said to consist of true<br>knowledge. The wise, therefore, have declared religious merit to be the<br>foremost of all things and not the passage through the four successive<br>modes. By practising the duties of even one of these four modes agreeable<br>to the directions of the wise, we have attained to true merit, and,<br>therefore, we do not desire the second or the third mode, viz., celibacy<br>with study or renunciation. It is for this again that the wise have<br>declared religious merit to be the foremost of all things!' Hearing these<br>words of hers, Yama said, 'Do thou desist! I have been pleased with these<br>words of thine couched in proper letters and accents, and based on<br>reason. Do thou ask for a boon! Except the life of thy husband, O thou of<br>faultless features, I will bestow on thee any boon that thou mayst<br>solicit!' Hearing these words, Savitri said, 'Deprived of his kingdom and<br>bereft also of sight, my father-in-law leadeth a life of retirement in<br>our sylvan asylum. Let that king through thy favour attain his eye-sight,<br>and become strong 'like either fire or the Sun!' Yama said, 'O thou of<br>faultless features, I grant thee this boon! It will even be as thou hast<br>said! It seems that thou art fatigued with thy journey. Do thou desist,<br>therefore, and return! Suffer not thyself to be weary any longer!'<br>Savitri said, 'What weariness can I feel in the presence of my husband?<br>The lot that is my husband's is certainly mine also. Whither thou<br>carriest my husband, thither will I also repair! O chief of the<br>celestials, do thou again listen to me! Even a single interview with the<br>pious is highly desirable; friendship with them is still more so. And<br>intercourse with the virtuous can never be fruitless. Therefore, one<br>should live in the company of the righteous!' Yama said, 'These words<br>that thou hast spoken, so fraught with useful instruction, delight the<br>heart and enhance the wisdom of even the learned. Therefore, O lady,<br>solicit thou a second boon, except the life of Satyavan!' Savitri said,<br>'Sometime before, my wise and intelligent father-in-law was deprived of<br>his kingdom. May that monarch regain his kingdom. And may that superior<br>of mine never renounce his duties! Even this is the second boon that I<br>solicit!' Then Yama said,&#8212;'The king shall soon regain his kingdom. Nor<br>shall he ever fall off from his duties. Thus, O daughter of a king have I<br>fulfilled thy desire. Do thou now desist! Return! Do not take any future<br>trouble!' Savitri said, 'Thou hast restrained all creatures by thy<br>decrees, and it is by thy decrees that thou takest them away, not<br>according to thy will. Therefore it is, O god, O divine one, that people<br>call thee Yama! Do thou listen to the words that I say! The eternal duty<br>of the good towards all creatures is never to injure them in thought,<br>word, and deed, but to bear them love and give them their due. As regards<br>this world, everything here is like this (husband of mine). Men are<br>destitute of both devotion and skill. The good, however, show mercy to<br>even their foes when these seek their protection. Yama said, 'As water to<br>the thirsty soul, so are these words uttered by thee to me! Therefore, do<br>thou, O fair lady, if thou will, once again ask for any boon except<br>Salyavana's life!' At these words Savitri replied, That lord of earth, my<br>father, is without sons. That he may have a hundred sons begotten of his<br>loins, so that his line may be perpetuated, is the third boon I would ask<br>of thee!' Yama said, Thy sire, O auspicious lady, shall obtain a hundred<br>illustrious sons, who will perpetuate and increase their father's race!<br>Now, O daughter of a king, thou hast obtained thy wish. Do thou desist!<br>Thou hast come far enough.' Savitri said, 'Staying by the side of my<br>husband, I am not conscious of the length of the way I have walked.<br>Indeed, my mind rusheth to yet a longer way of. Do thou again, as thou<br>goest on, listen to the words that I will presently utter! Thou art the<br>powerful son of Vivaswat. It is for this that thou art called Vaivaswata<br>by the wise. And, O lord, since thou dealest out equal law unto all<br>created things, thou hast been designated the lord of justice! One<br>reposeth not, even in one's own self, the confidence that one doth in the<br>righteous. Therefore, every one wisheth particularly for intimacy with<br>the righteous. It is goodness of heart alone that inspireth the<br>confidence of all creatures. And it is for this that people rely<br>particularly on the righteous.' And hearing these words, Yama said, 'The<br>words that thou utterest, O fair lady, I have not heard from any one save<br>thee; I am highly pleased with this speech of thine. Except the life of<br>Satyavan, solicit thou, therefore, a fourth boon, and then go thy way!'<br>Savitri then said, 'Both of me and Satyavan's loins, begotten by both of<br>us, let there be a century of sons possessed of strength and prowess and<br>capable of perpetuating our race! Even this is the fourth boon that I<br>would beg of thee!' Hearing these words of hers, Yama replied, 'Thou<br>shalt, O lady, obtain a century of sons, possessed of strength and<br>prowess, and causing thee great delight, O daughter of a king, let no<br>more weariness be thine! Do thou desist! Thou hast already come too far!'<br>Thus addressed, Savitri said, 'They that are righteous always practise<br>eternal morality! And the communion of the pious with the pious is never<br>fruitless! Nor is there any danger to the pious from those that are<br>pious. And verily it is the righteous who by their truth make the Sun<br>move in the heaven. And it is the righteous that support the earth by<br>their austerities! And, O king, it is the righteous upon whom both the<br>past and the future depend! Therefore, they that are righteous, are never<br>cheerless in the company of the righteous. Knowing this to be the eternal<br>practice of the good and righteous, they that are righteous continue to<br>do good to others without expecting any benefit in return. A good office<br>is never thrown away on the good and virtuous. Neither interest nor<br>dignity suffereth any injury by such an act. And since such conduct ever<br>adheres to the righteous, the righteous often become the protectors of<br>all.' Hearing these words of hers, Yama replied, 'The more thou utterest<br>such speeches that are pregnant with great import, full of honeyed<br>phrases, instinct with morality, and agreeable to mind, the more is the<br>respect that I feel for thee! O thou that art so devoted to thy lord, ask<br>for some incomparable boon!' Thus addressed, Savitri said, 'O bestower of<br>honours, the boon thou hast already given me is incapable of<br>accomplishment without union with my husband. Therefore, among other<br>boons, I ask for this, may this Satyavan be restored to life! Deprived of<br>my husband, I am as one dead! Without my husband, I do not wish for<br>happiness. Without my husband, I do not wish for heaven itself. Without<br>my husband, I do not wish for prosperity. Without my husband, I cannot<br>make up my mind to live! Thou thyself hast bestowed on me the boon,<br>namely, of a century of sons; yet thou takest away my husband! I ask for<br>this boon, 'May Satyavan be restored to life, for by that thy words will<br>be made true.'"<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Thereupon saying,&#8212;So be it,&#8212;Vivaswat's son,<br>Yama, the dispenser of justice, untied his noose, and with cheerful heart<br>said these words to Savitri, 'Thus, O auspicious and chaste lady, is thy<br>husband freed by me! Thou wilt be able to take him back free from<br>disease. And he will attain to success! And along with thee, he will<br>attain a life of four hundred years. And celebrating sacrifices with due<br>rites, he will achieve great fame in this world. And upon thee Satyavan<br>will also beget a century of sons. And these Kshatriyas with their sons<br>and grandsons will all be kings, and will always be famous in connection<br>with thy name. And thy father also will beget a hundred sons on thy<br>mother Malavi. And under the name of the Malavas, thy Kshatriya brothers,<br>resembling the celestials, will be widely known along with their sons and<br>daughters!' And having bestowed these boons on Savitri and having thus<br>made her desist, Yama departed for his abode. Savitri, after Yama had<br>gone away, went back to the spot where her husband's ash-coloured corpse<br>lay, and seeing her lord on the ground, she approached him, and taking<br>hold of him, she placed his head on her lap and herself sat down on the<br>ground. Then Satyavan regained his consciousness, and affectionately<br>eyeing Savitri again and again, like one come home after a sojourn in a<br>strange land, he addressed her thus, 'Alas, I have slept long! Wherefore<br>didst thou not awake me? And where is that same sable person that was<br>dragging me away?' At these words of his, Savitri said, 'Thou hast, O<br>bull among men, slept long on my lap! That restrainer of creatures, the<br>worshipful Yama, had gone away. Thou art refreshed, O blessed one, and<br>sleep hath forsaken thee, O son of a king! If thou art able, rise thou<br>up! Behold, the night is deep!'"<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Having regained consciousness, Satyavan rose up<br>like one who had enjoyed a sweet sleep, and seeing every side covered<br>with woods, said, 'O girl of slender waist, I came with thee for<br>procuring fruits. Then while I was cutting wood I felt a pain in my head.<br>And on account of that intense pain about my head I was unable to stand<br>for any length of time, and, therefore, I lay on thy lap and slept. All<br>this, O auspicious lady, I remember. Then, as thou didst embrace me,<br>sleep stole away my senses. I then saw that it was dark all around. In<br>the midst of it I saw a person of exceeding effulgence. If thou knowest<br>everything, do thou then, O girl of slender waist, tell me whether what I<br>saw was only a dream or a reality!' Thereupon, Savitri addressed him,<br>saying, The night deepens. I shall, O prince, relate everything unto thee<br>on the morrow. Arise, arise, may good betide thee! And, O thou of<br>excellent vows, come and behold thy parents! The sun hath set a long<br>while ago and the night deepens. Those rangers of the night, having<br>frightful voices, are walking about in glee. And sounds are heard,<br>proceeding from the denizens of the forest treading through the woods.<br>These terrible shrieks of jackals that are issuing from the south and the<br>east make my heart tremble (in fear)!' Satyavan then said, 'Covered with<br>deep darkness, the wilderness hath worn a dreadful aspect. Thou wilt,<br>therefore, not be able to discern the tract, and consequently wilt not be<br>able to go!' Then Savitri replied, 'In consequence of a conflagration<br>having taken place in the forest today a withered tree standeth aflame,<br>and the flames being stirred by the wind are discerned now and then. I<br>shall fetch some fire and light these faggots around. Do thou dispel all<br>anxiety. I will do all (this) if thou darest not go, for I find thee<br>unwell. Nor wilt thou be able to discover the way through this forest<br>enveloped in darkness. Tomorrow when the woods become visible, we will go<br>hence, if thou please! If, O sinless one, it is thy wish, we shall pass<br>this night even here!' At these words of hers, Satyavan replied, 'The<br>pain in my head is off; and I feel well in my limbs. With thy favour I<br>wish to behold my father and mother. Never before did I return to the<br>hermitage after the proper time had passed away. Even before it is<br>twilight my mother confineth me within the asylum. Even when I come out<br>during the day, my parents become anxious on my account, and my father<br>searcheth for me, together with all the inhabitants of the sylvan<br>asylums. Before this, moved by deep grief, my father and mother had<br>rebuked me many times and often, saying,&#8212;Thou comest having tarried<br>long! I am thinking of the pass they have today come to on my account,<br>for, surely, great grief will be theirs when they miss me. One night<br>before this, the old couple, who love me dearly, wept from deep sorrow<br>and said into me, 'Deprived of thee, O son, we cannot live for even a<br>moment. As long as thou livest, so long, surely, we also will live. Thou<br>art the crutch of these blind ones; on thee doth perpetuity of our race<br>depend. On thee also depend our funeral cake, our fame and our<br>descendants! My mother is old, and my father also is so. I am surely<br>their crutch. If they see me not in the night, what, oh, will be their<br>plight! I hate that slumber of mine for the sake of which my unoffending<br>mother and my father have both been in trouble, and I myself also, am<br>placed in such rending distress! Without my father and mother, I cannot<br>bear to live. It is certain that by this time my blind father, his mind<br>disconsolate with grief, is asking everyone of the inhabitants of the<br>hermitage about me! I do not, O fair girl, grieve so much for myself as I<br>do for my sire, and for my weak mother ever obedient to her lord! Surely,<br>they will be afflicted with extreme anguish on account of me. I hold my<br>life so long as they live. And I know that they should be maintained by<br>me and that I should do only what is agreeable to them!'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Having said this, that virtuous youth who loved<br>and revered his parents, afflicted with grief held up his arms and began<br>to lament in accents of woe. And seeing her lord overwhelmed with sorrow<br>the virtuous Savitri wiped away the tears from his eyes and said, 'If I<br>have observed austerities, and have given away in charity, and have<br>performed sacrifice, may this night be for the good of my father-in-law,<br>mother-in-law and husband! I do not remember having told a single<br>falsehood, even in jest. Let my father-in-law and mother-in-law hold<br>their lives by virtue of the truth!' Satyavan said, 'I long for the sight<br>of my father and mother! Therefore, O Savitri, proceed without delay. O<br>beautiful damsel, I swear by my own self that if I find any evil to have<br>befallen my father and mother, I will not live. If thou hast any regard<br>for virtue, if thou wishest me to live, if it is thy duty to do what is<br>agreeable to me, proceed thou to the hermitage!' The beautiful Savitri<br>then rose and tying up her hair, raised her husband in her arms. And<br>Satyavan having risen, rubbed his limbs with his hands. And as he<br>surveyed all around, his eyes fell upon his wallet. Then Savitri said<br>unto him, 'Tomorrow thou mayst gather fruits. And I shall carry thy axe<br>for thy ease.' Then hanging up the wallet upon the bough of a tree, and<br>taking up the axe, she re-approached her husband. And that lady of<br>beautiful thighs, placing her husband's left arm upon her left shoulder,<br>and embracing him with her right arms, proceeded with elephantic gait.<br>Then Satyavan said, 'O timid one, by virtue of habit, the (forest) paths<br>are known to me. And further, by the light of the moon between the trees,<br>I can see them. We have now reached the same path that we took in the<br>morning for gathering fruits. Do thou, O auspicious one, proceed by the<br>way that we had come: thou needst not any longer feel dubious about our<br>path. Near that tract overgrown with Palasa tree, the way diverges into<br>two. Do thou proceed along the path that lies to the north of it. I am<br>now well and have got back my strength. I long to see my father and<br>mother!' Saying this Satyavan hastily proceeded towards the hermitage.'"
