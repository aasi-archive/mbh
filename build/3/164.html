                            Vaisampayana continued, "And it came to pass that once a day as those<br>mighty charioteers were thinking of Arjuna, seeing Mahendra's car, yoked<br>with horses of the effulgence of lightning, arrive all on a sudden, they<br>were delighted. And driven by Matali, that blazing car, suddenly<br>illuminating the sky, looked like smokeless flaming tongues of fire, or a<br>mighty meteor embosomed in clouds. And seated in that car appeared Kiriti<br>wearing garlands and new-made ornaments. Then Dhananjaya possessing the<br>prowess of the wielder of the thunder-bolt, alighted on that mountain,<br>blazing in beauty. And that intelligent one decked in a diadem and<br>garlands, having alighted on the mountain, first bowed down at the feet<br>of Dhaumya, and then at those of Ajatasatru. And he also paid homage unto<br>Vrikodara's feet; and the twins also bowed down unto him. Then going to<br>Krishna, and having cheered her, he stood before his (elder) brother in<br>humble guise. And on meeting with that matchless one, they were<br>exceedingly delighted. And he also meeting with them rejoiced<br>exceedingly, and began to eulogise the king. And seeing before them that<br>car driving in which the slayer of Namuchi had annihilated seven<br>phalanxes of Diti's offspring, the magnanimous Parthas went round it. And<br>being highly pleased, they offered excellent worship unto Matali, as unto<br>the lord of the celestials himself. And then the son of the Kuru king<br>duly enquired of him after the health of all the gods. And Matali also<br>greeted them. And having instructed the Parthas even as a father doth his<br>sons, he ascended that incomparable car, and returned to the lord of the<br>celestials.<br><br>"And when Matali had gone away, that foremost of the royal race, Sakra's<br>son, the high-souled destroyer of all foes made over unto his love, the<br>mother of Sutasoma, beautiful precious gems and ornaments having the<br>splendour of the sun, which had been presented to him by Sakra. Then,<br>sitting in the midst of those foremost of the Kurus, and those best of<br>the Brahmanas, effulgent like unto fire or the sun, he began to relate<br>all as it had happened, saying, "In this way, I have learnt weapons from<br>Sakra, Vayu, and the manifest Siva; and all the celestials with Indra<br>also have been pleased with me, on account of my good behaviour, and<br>concentration.'<br><br>"After having briefly narrated unto them his sojourn in heaven, Kiriti of<br>spotless deeds agreeably slept that night with the two sons of Madri."
