                            "Lomasa continued, 'Listen now, O Yudhishthira, to what Dhananjaya hath<br>said: 'Cause my brother Yudhishthira to attend to the practice of virtue<br>which leadeth to prosperity. Endued with wealth of asceticism, thou art<br>conversant with the highest morality, with ascetic austerities of every<br>kind, with the eternal duties of kings blessed with prosperity, and the<br>high and sanctifying merit that men obtain from tirthas. Persuade thou<br>the sons of Pandu to acquire the merit attaching to tirthas. Do thou with<br>thy whole soul persuade the king to visit the tirthas and give away<br>kine.' This is what Arjuna said unto me. Indeed he also said, 'Let him<br>visit all the tirthas protected by thee. Thou wilt also protect him from<br>Rakshasas, and watch over him in inaccessible regions and rugged mountain<br>breasts. And as Dadhichi had protected Indra, and Angiras had protected<br>the Sun, so do thou, O best of regenerate ones, protect the sons of Kunti<br>from Rakshasas. Along the way are many Rakshasas, huge as<br>mountain-cliffs. But protected by thee these will not be able to approach<br>the sons of Kunti. Obedient to the words of Indra and at the request of<br>Arjuna also protecting thee from dangers, I shall wander with thee.<br>Before this, O son of the Kuru race, I have twice visited the tirthas.<br>With thee I shall repair to them for the third time. O Yudhishthira, Manu<br>and other royal Rishis of meritorious deeds had undertaken journeys to<br>tirthas. Indeed, a trip to them is capable of dispelling all fear, O<br>king! They that are crooked-minded, they that have not their souls under<br>control, they that are illiterate and perverse, do not, O Kauravya, bathe<br>in tirthas. But thou art ever of a virtuous disposition and conversant<br>with morality and firm in thy promises. Thou wilt surely be able to free<br>thyself from the world. For, O son of Pandu, thou art even as king<br>Bhagiratha, or Gaya, or Yayati, or any one, O son of Kunti, that is like<br>them.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira answered, 'I am so overwhelmed with delight, O Brahmana,<br>that I cannot find words to answer thee. Who can be more fortunate than<br>he who is remembered even by the lord of the celestials? Who can be more<br>fortunate than he who hath been favoured with thy company, who hath<br>Dhananjaya for a brother, and who is thought of by Vasava himself? As to<br>thy words, O illustrious one, in respect of a trip to the tirthas, my<br>mind had already been made up at the words of Dhaumya. O Brahmana, I<br>shall start, at whatever hour thou mayst be pleased to appoint, on the<br>proposed journey to tirthas. Even this is my firm resolve!'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Lomasa then said unto Yudhishthira, who had made<br>up his mind to start on the proposed journey, 'O mighty king, be thou<br>light as regards thy retinue, for by this thou wilt be able to go more<br>easily!'<br><br>"Yudhishthira then said, 'Let those mendicants and Brahmanas and Yogis<br>that are incapable of bearing hunger and thirst, the fatigues of travel<br>and toil, and the severity of winter, desist. Let those Brahmanas also<br>desist that live on sweetmeats, and they also that desire cooked viands<br>and food that is sucked or drunk as well as meat. And let those also<br>remain behind that are dependent on cooks. Let those citizens that have<br>followed me from motives of loyalty, and whom I have hitherto kept on<br>proper stipends, repair to king Dhritarashtra. He will give them their<br>allowances in due time. If, however, that king refuses to grant them<br>proper allowances, the king of the Panchalas will, for our satisfaction<br>and welfare, give them these.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "And thereupon oppressed with grief, the citizens<br>and the principal Brahmanas and Yatis set out for Hastinapura. And out of<br>affection for Yudhishthira the just, the royal son of Amvika received<br>them properly, and gratified them with proper allowances. And the royal<br>son of Kunti, with only a small number of Brahmanas, abode for three<br>nights at Kamyaka, cheered by Lomasa."
