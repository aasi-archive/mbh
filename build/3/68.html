                            "Vaisampayana said, 'After Nala, despoiled of his kingdom, had, with his<br>wife, become a bondsman, Bhima with the desire of seeing Nala sent out<br>Brahmanas to search for him. And giving them profuse wealth, Bhima<br>enjoined on them, saying, 'Do ye search for Nala, and also for my<br>daughter Damayanti. He who achieveth this task, viz., ascertaining where<br>the ruler of the Nishadhas is, bringeth him and my daughter hither, will<br>obtain from me a thousand kine, and fields, and a village resembling a<br>town. Even if failing to bring Damayanti and Nala here, he that succeeds<br>learning their whereabouts, will get from me the wealth represented by a<br>thousand kine.' Thus addressed, the Brahmanas cheerfully went out in all<br>directions seeking Nala and his wife in cities and provinces. But Nala or<br>his spouse they found not anywhere. Until at length searching in the<br>beautiful city of the Chedis, a Brahmana named Sudeva, during the time of<br>the king's prayers, saw the princess of Vidarbha in the palace of the<br>king, seated with Sunanda. And her incomparable beauty was slightly<br>perceptible, like the brightness of a fire enveloped in curls of smoke.<br>And beholding that lady of large eyes, soiled and emaciated he decided<br>her to be Damayanti, coming to that conclusion from various reasons. And<br>Sudeva said, 'As I saw her before, this damsel is even so at present. O,<br>I am blest, by casting my eyes on this fair one, like Sree herself<br>delighting the worlds! Resembling the full moon, of unchanging youth, of<br>well-rounded breasts, illumining all sides by her splendour, possessed of<br>large eyes like beautiful lotuses, like unto Kama's Rati herself the<br>delight of all the worlds like the rays of the full moon, O, she looketh<br>like a lotus-stalk transplanted by adverse fortune from the Vidarbha lake<br>and covered with mire in the process. And oppressed with grief on account<br>of her husband, and melancholy, she looketh like the night of the full<br>moon when Rahu hath swallowed that luminary, or like a stream whose<br>current hath dried up. Her plight is very much like that of a ravaged<br>lake with the leaves of its lotuses crushed by the trunks of elephants,<br>and with its birds and fowls affrighted by the invasion. Indeed, this<br>girl, of a delicate frame and of lovely limbs, and deserving to dwell in<br>a mansion decked with gems, is (now) like an uprooted lotus-stalk<br>scorched by the sun. Endued with beauty and generosity of nature, and<br>destitute of ornaments, though deserving of them, she looketh like the<br>moon 'new bent in haven' but covered with black clouds. Destitute of<br>comforts and luxuries, separated from loved ones and friends, she liveth<br>in distress, supported by the hope of beholding her lord. Verily, the<br>husband is the best ornament of a woman, however destitute of ornaments.<br>Without her husband beside her, this lady, though beautiful, shineth not.<br>It is a hard feat achieved by Nala in that he liveth without succumbing<br>to grief, though separated from such a wife. Beholding this damsel<br>possessed of black hair and of eyes like lotus-leaves, in woe though<br>deserving of bliss, even my heart is pained. Alas! when shall this girl<br>graced with auspicious marks and devoted to her husband, crossing this<br>ocean of woe, regain the company of her lord, like Rohini regaining the<br>Moon's? Surely, the king of the Nishadhas will experience in regaining<br>her the delight that a king deprived of his kingdom experienceth in<br>regaining his kingdom. Equal to her in nature and age and extraction,<br>Nala deserveth the daughter of Vidarbha, and this damsel of black eyes<br>also deserveth him. It behoveth me to comfort the queen of that hero of<br>immeasurable prowess and endued with energy and might, (since) she is so<br>eager to meet her husband. I will console this afflicted girl of face<br>like the full moon, and suffering distress that she had never before<br>endured, and ever meditating on her lord.'<br><br>"Vrihadaswa continued, 'Having thus reflected on these various<br>circumstances and signs, the Brahmana, Sudeva, approached Damayanti, and<br>addressed her, saying, 'O princess of Vidarbha, I am Sudeva, the dear<br>friend of thy brother. I have come here, seeking thee, at the desire of<br>king Bhima. Thy father is well, and also thy mother, and thy brothers.<br>And thy son and daughter, blessed with length of days, are living in<br>peace. Thy relatives, though alive, are almost dead on thy account, and<br>hundreds of Brahmanas are ranging the world in search of thee."<br><br>"Vrihadaswa continued, 'O Yudhishthira, Damayanti recognising Sudeva,<br>asked him respecting all her relatives and kinsmen one after another.<br>And, O monarch, oppressed with grief, the princess of Vidarbha began to<br>weep bitterly, at the unexpected sight of Sudeva, that foremost of<br>Brahmanas and the friend of her brother. And, O Bharata, beholding<br>Damayanti weeping, and conversing in private with Sudeva, Sunanda was<br>distressed, and going to her mother informed her, saying, 'Sairindhri is<br>weeping bitterly in the presence of a Brahmana. If thou likest, satisfy<br>thyself.' And thereupon the mother of the king of the Chedis, issuing<br>from the inner apartments of the palace, came to the place where the girl<br>(Damayanti) was with that Brahmana. Then calling Sudeva, O king, the<br>queen-mother asked him, 'Whose wife is this fair one, and whose daughter?<br>How hath this lady of beautiful eyes been deprived of the company of her<br>relatives and of her husband as well? And how also hast thou come to know<br>this lady fallen into such a plight? I wish to hear all this in detail<br>from thee. Do truly relate unto me who am asking thee about this damsel<br>of celestial beauty.' Then, O king, thus addressed by the queen-mother,<br>Sudeva, that best of Brahmanas, sat at his ease, and began to relate the<br>true history of Damayanti.'"
