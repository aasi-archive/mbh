                            Vaisampayana said, "There observing cleanliness, those tigers among men<br>dwelt for six nights, in expectation of beholding Dhananjaya. And it came<br>to pass that all of a sudden there blew a wind from the north-east and<br>brought a celestial lotus of a thousand petals and effulgent as the sun.<br>And Panchali saw that pure and charming lotus of unearthly fragrance,<br>brought by the wind and left on the ground. And having obtained that<br>excellent and beautiful lotus, that blessed one became exceedingly<br>delighted, O king, and addressed Bhimasena in the following words,<br>'Behold, O Bhima, this most beautiful unearthly flower having within it<br>the very source of fragrance. It gladdenth my heart, O represser of foes.<br>This one shall be presented to Yudhishthira the just. Do thou, therefore,<br>procure others for my satisfaction&#8212;in order that I may carry them to our<br>hermitage in the Kamyaka. If, O Pritha's son, I have found grace with<br>thee, do thou then procure others of this species in large numbers. I<br>wish to carry them to our hermitage.' Having said this, the blameless<br>lady of beautiful glances approached Yudhishthira the just, taking the<br>flower. And knowing the desire of his beloved queen that bull among men,<br>Bhima of great strength, also set out, in order to gratify her. And<br>intent upon fetching the flowers, he began to proceed at rapid space,<br>facing the wind, in the direction from which the flower had come. And<br>taking the bow inlaid with gold on the back as also arrows like unto<br>venomous snakes, he proceeded as a lion in anger or an elephant in rut.<br>And all beings gazed at him, holding a mighty bow and arrows. And neither<br>exhaustion, nor langour, neither fear nor confusion, ever possessed the<br>son of Pritha and the offspring of Vayu (wind). And desirous of pleasing<br>Draupadi the mighty one, free from fear or confusion, ascended the peak<br>depending on the strength of his arms. And that slayer of foes began to<br>range that beautiful peak covered with trees, creepers and of black rocky<br>base; and frequented by Kinnaras; and variegated with minerals, plants,<br>beasts, and birds of various hues; and appearing like an upraised arm of<br>the Earth adorned with an entire set of ornaments. And that one of<br>matchless prowess proceeded, fixing his look at the slopes of the<br>Gandhamadana,&#8212;beautiful with flowers of every season&#8212;and revolving<br>various thoughts in his mind and with his ears, eyes and mind rivetted to<br>the spots resounding with the notes of male kokilas and ringing with the<br>hum of black bees. And like an elephant in rut ranging mad in a forest<br>that one of mighty prowess smelt the rare odour proceeding from the<br>flowers of every season. And he was fanned by the fresh breeze of the<br>Gandhamadana bearing the perfumes of various blossoms and cooling like<br>unto a father's touch. On his fatigue being removed the down on his body<br>stood on end. And in this state that represser of foes for the flowers<br>began to survey all the mountain, inhabited by Yakshas and Gandharvas and<br>celestials and Brahmarshis. And brushed by the leaves of Saptachchada<br>tree, besmeared with fresh red, black and white minerals, he looked as if<br>decorated with lines of holy unguents drawn by fingers. And with clouds<br>stretching at its sides, the mountain seemed dancing with outspread<br>wings. And on account of the trickling waters of springs, it appeared to<br>be decked with necklaces of pearls. And it contained romantic caverns and<br>groves and cascades and caves. And there were excellent peacocks dancing<br>to the jingling of the bangles of the Apsaras. And its rocky surface was<br>worn away by the end of tusks of the elephants presiding over the<br>cardinal points. And with the waters of rivers falling down, the mountain<br>looked as if its clothes were getting loosened. And that graceful son of<br>the wind-god playfully and cheerfully went on, pushing away by his force<br>countless intertwisted creepers. And stags in curiosity gazed at him,<br>with grass in their mouths. And not having experienced fear (ever<br>before), they were unalarmed, and did not flee away. And being engaged in<br>fulfilling the desire of his love, the youthful son of Pandu, stalwart<br>and of splendour like unto the hue of gold; and having a body strong as a<br>lion; and treading like a mad elephant; and possessing the force of a mad<br>elephant; and having coppery eyes like unto those of a mad elephant; and<br>capable of checking a mad elephant began to range the romantic sides of<br>the Gandhamadana with his beautiful eyes uplifted; and displaying as it<br>were a novel type of beauty. And the wives of Yakshas and Gandharvas<br>sitting invisible by the side of their husbands, stared at him, turning<br>their faces with various motions. Intent upon gratifying Draupadi exiled<br>unto the woods, as he was ranging the beautiful Gandhamadana, he<br>remembered the many and various woes caused by Duryodhana. And he<br>thought, 'Now that Arjuna sojourn in heaven and that I too have come away<br>to procure the flowers, what will our brother Yudhishthira do at present?<br>Surely, from affection and doubting their prowess, that foremost of men,<br>Yudhishthira, will not let Nakula and Sahadeva come in search of us. How,<br>again, can I obtain the flowers soon?' Thinking thus, that tiger among<br>men proceeded in amain like unto the king of birds, his mind and sight<br>fixed on the delightful side of the mountain. And having for his<br>provisions on the journey the words of Draupadi, the mighty son of Pandu,<br>Vrikodara Bhima, endued with strength and the swiftness of the wind, with<br>his mind and sight fixed on the blooming slopes of the mountain,<br>proceeded speedily, making the earth tremble with his tread, even as doth<br>a hurricane at the equinox; and frightening herds of elephants and<br>grinding lions and tigers and deer and uprooting and smashing large trees<br>and tearing away by force plants and creepers, like unto an elephant<br>ascending higher and higher the summit of a mountain; and roaring<br>fiercely even as a cloud attended with thunder. And awakened by that<br>mighty roaring of Bhima, tigers came out of their dens, while other<br>rangers of the forest hid themselves. And the coursers of the skies<br>sprang up (on their wing) in fright. And herds of deer hurriedly ran<br>away. And birds left the trees (and fled). And lions forsook their dens.<br>And the mighty lions were roused from their slumber. And the buffaloes<br>stared. And the elephants in fright, leaving that wood, ran to more<br>extensive forests company with their mates. And the boars and the deer<br>and the lions and the buffaloes and the tigers and the jackals and the<br>gavayas of the wood began to cry in herds. And the ruddy geese, and the<br>gallinules and the ducks and the karandavas and the plavas and the<br>parrots and the male kokilas and the herons in confusion flew in all<br>directions, while some proud elephants urged by their mates, as also some<br>lions and elephants in rage, flew at Bhimasena. And as they were<br>distracted at heart through fear, these fierce animals discharging urine<br>and dung, set up loud yells with gapping mouths. Thereupon the<br>illustrious and graceful son of the wind-god, the mighty Pandava,<br>depending upon the strength of his arms, began to slay one elephant with<br>another elephant and one lion with another lion while he despatched the<br>others with slaps. And on being struck by Bhima the lions and the tigers<br>and the leopards, in fright gave loud cries and discharged urine and<br>dung. And after having destroyed these the handsome son of Pandu,<br>possessed of mighty strength, entered into the forest, making all sides<br>resound with his shouts. And then the long-armed one saw on the slopes of<br>the Gandhamadana a beautiful plantain tree spreading over many a yojana.<br>And like unto a mad lion, that one of great strength proceeded amain<br>towards that tree breaking down various plants. And that foremost of<br>strong persons&#8212;Bhima&#8212;uprooting innumerable plantain trunks equal in<br>height to many palm-trees (placed one above another), cast them on all<br>sides with force. And that highly powerful one, haughty like a male lion,<br>sent up shouts. And then he encountered countless beasts of gigantic<br>size, and stags, and monkeys, and lions, and buffaloes, and aquatic<br>animals. And what with the cries of these, and what with the shouts of<br>Bhima, even the beasts and birds that were at distant parts of the wood,<br>became all frightened. And hearing those cries of beasts and birds,<br>myriads of aquatic fowls suddenly rose up on wetted wings. And seeing<br>these fowls of water, that bull among the Bharatas proceeded in that<br>direction; and saw a vast and romantic lake. And that fathomless lake<br>was, as it were, being fanned by the golden plantain trees on the coast,<br>shaken by the soft breezes. And immediately descending into the lake<br>abounding in lilies and lotuses, he began to sport lustily like unto a<br>mighty maddened elephant. Having thus sported there for a long while, he<br>of immeasurable effulgence ascended, in order to penetrate with speed<br>into that forest filled with trees. Then the Pandava winded with all his<br>might his loud-blowing shell. And striking his arms with his hands, the<br>mighty Bhima made all the points of heaven resound. And filled with the<br>sounds of the shell, and with the shouts of Bhimasena, and also with the<br>reports produced by the striking of his arms, the caves of the mountain<br>seemed as if they were roaring. And hearing those loud arm-strokes, like<br>unto the crashing of thunder, the lions that were slumbering in the<br>caves, uttered mighty howls. And being terrified by the yelling of the<br>lions, the elephants, O Bharata, sent forth tremendous roars, which<br>filled the mountain. And hearing those sounds emitted, and knowing also<br>Bhimasena to be his brother, the ape Hanuman, the chief of monkeys, with<br>the view of doing good to Bhima, obstructed the path leading to heaven.<br>And thinking that he (Bhima) should not pass that way,(Hanuman) lay<br>across the narrow path, beautified by plantain trees, obstructing it for<br>the sake of the safety of Bhima. With the object that Bhima might not<br>come by curse or defeat, by entering into the plantain wood, the ape<br>Hanuman of huge body lay down amidst the plantain trees, being overcome<br>with drowsiness. And he began to yawn, lashing his long tail, raised like<br>unto the pole consecrated to Indra, and sounding like thunder. And on all<br>sides round, the mountains by the mouths of caves emitted those sounds in<br>echo, like a cow lowing. And as it was being shaken by the reports<br>produced by the lashing of the tail, the mountain with its summits<br>tottering, began to crumble all around. And overcoming that roaring of<br>mad elephants, the sounds of his tail spread over the varied slopes of<br>the mountain.<br><br>"On those sounds being heard the down of Bhima's body stood on end; and<br>he began to range that plantain wood, in search of those sounds. And that<br>one of mighty arms saw the monkey-chief in the plantain wood, on an<br>elevated rocky base. And he was hard to be looked at even as the<br>lightning-flash; and of coppery hue like that of the lightning-flash: and<br>endued with the voice of the lightning-flash; and quick moving as the<br>lightning-flash; and having his short flesh neck supported on his<br>shoulders; and with his waist slender in consequence of the fullness of<br>his shoulders. And his tail covered with long hair, and a little bent at<br>the end, was raised like unto a banner. And (Bhima) saw Hanuman's head<br>furnished with small lips, and coppery face and tongue, and red ears, and<br>brisk eyes, and bare white incisors sharpened at the edge.' And his head<br>was like unto the shining moon; adorned with white teeth within the<br>mouth; and with mane scattered over, resembling a heap of asoka flowers.<br>And amidst the golden plantain trees, that one of exceeding effulgence<br>was lying like unto a blazing fire, with his radiant body. And that<br>slayer of foes as casting glances with his eyes reddened with<br>intoxication. And the intelligent Bhima saw that mighty chief of monkeys,<br>of huge body, lying like unto the Himalaya, obstructing the path of<br>heaven. And seeing him alone in that mighty forest, the undaunted<br>athletic Bhima, of long arms, approached him with rapid strides, and<br>uttered a loud shout like unto the thunder. And at that shout of Bhima,<br>beasts and birds became all alarmed. The powerful Hanuman, however,<br>opening his eyes partially looked at him (Bhima) with disregard, with<br>eyes reddened with intoxication. And then smilingly addressing him,<br>Hanuman said the following words, 'Ill as I am, I was sleeping sweetly.<br>Why hast thou awakened me? Thou shouldst show kindness to all creatures,<br>as thou hast reason. Belonging to the animal species, we are ignorant of<br>virtue. But being endued with reason, men show kindness towards<br>creatures. Why do then reasonable persons like thee commit themselves to<br>acts contaminating alike body, speech, and heart, and destructive of<br>virtue? Thou knowest not what virtue is, neither hast thou taken council<br>of the wise. And therefore it is that from ignorance, and childishness<br>thou destroyest the lower animals. Say, who art thou, and what for hast<br>thou come to the forest devoid of humanity and human beings? And, O<br>foremost of men, tell thou also, whither thou wilt go to-day. Further it<br>is impossible to proceed. Yonder hills are inaccessible. O hero, save the<br>passage obtained by the practice of asceticism, there is no passage to<br>that place. This is the path of the celestials; it is ever impassable by<br>mortals. Out of kindness, O hero, do I dissuade thee. Do thou hearken<br>unto my words. Thou canst not proceed further from this place. Therefore,<br>O lord, do thou desist. O chief of men, to-day in very way thou art<br>welcome to this place. If thou think it proper to accept my words, do<br>thou then, O best of men, rest here, partaking of fruits and roots, sweet<br>as ambrosia, and do not have thyself destroyed for naught."
