                            "Somaka said, 'O Brahmana! whatever is to be performed&#8212;do precisely as<br>it may be necessary. As I am desirous of having a number of sons, I shall<br>do all that may be prescribed by thee."<br><br>"Lomasa said, "Then the priest officiated in the sacrifice in which Jantu<br>was offered as the victim. But the mothers is in pity forcibly snatched<br>the son and took him away. And they cried, 'We are undone!' And they were<br>smitten with torturing grief and they caught hold of Jantu by his right<br>hand, and wept in a piteous way. But the officiating priest held the boy<br>by the right hand and pulled him. And like female ospreys they screamed<br>in agony! but the priest dragged the son killed him and made a burnt<br>offering of his fat in the proper form. And, O delight of the race of<br>Kuru! While the fat was being made an offering of the agonised mothers<br>smelt its smell, and of a sudden fell to the ground (and swooned away.)<br>And then all those lovely women became with child, and O lord of men! O<br>scion of Bharata's race! When ten months had passed a full century of<br>sons was born to Somaka begotten on all those women. And, O monarch of<br>the earth! Jantu became the eldest and was born of his former mother and<br>he became the most beloved to the women,&#8212;not so were their own sons. And<br>on his back there was that mark of gold and of that century of sons, he<br>was also superior in merit. Then that family priest of Somaka departed<br>this life as also Somaka after a certain time. Now he beheld that the<br>priest was being grilled in a terrible hell. And thereupon he questioned<br>him, 'Why art thou, O Brahmana! being grilled in this hell?" Then the<br>family priest exceedingly scorched with fire, spake to him saying, 'This<br>is the outcome of my having officiated in that sacrifice of thine.' O<br>king, hearing this, the saintly king thus spake to the god who meteth out<br>punishments to departed souls, 'I shall enter here. Set free my<br>officiating priest; this reversed man is being grilled by hell-fire on my<br>account only.'<br><br>"Dharmaraja thereat answered thus, 'One cannot enjoy or suffer for<br>another person's acts. O best of speakers! these are the fruits of thy<br>acts; see it here.'<br><br>"Somaka said, 'Without this Brahmana here, I desire not go to the blessed<br>regions. My desire is to dwell in company with this very man, either in<br>the abode of the gods, or in hell, for, O Dharmaraja! my deed is<br>identical with what hath been done by him and the fruit of our virtuous<br>or evil deed must be the same for both of us.'<br><br>"Dharmaraja said, 'O king! If this is thy wish, then taste with him the<br>fruit of that act, for the same period that he must do. After that thou<br>shall go to the blessed regions.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, The lotus-eyed king did all that exactly in the way<br>prescribed to him. And when his sins were worked off, he was set free<br>together with the priest. O king! Fond of the priest as he was, he won<br>all those blessings to which he had entitled himself by his meritorious<br>acts and shared everything with the family priest. This is his hermitage<br>which looketh lovely before our eyes. Any one would attain the blessed<br>regions, if he should spend six nights here controlling his passions. O<br>king of kings! O leader of the tribe of Kurus! Here, free from excitement<br>and self-controlled, we must spend six nights. Be thou ready therefor.'"
