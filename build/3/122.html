                            "Lomasa said, 'A son was born to the great saint Bhrigu, Chyavana by<br>name. And he, of an exceedingly resplendent form, began to practise<br>austerities by the side of yonder lake. And, O Pandu's son! O protector<br>of men! he of mighty energy assumed the posture called Vira, quiet and<br>still like an inanimate post, and for a long period, remained at the same<br>spot of ground. And he was turned into an anthill covered over with<br>creepers. And after the lapse of a long period, swarms of ants enveloped<br>him. And covered all over with ants, the sagacious saint looked exactly<br>like a heap of earth. And he went on practising austerities, enveloped on<br>all sides with that ant-hill. Now after the lapse of a long space of<br>time, that ruler of earth, Saryati by name, for amusement visited this<br>pleasant and excellent lake. With him were four thousand females,<br>espoused by him, O son of Bharata's race! there was also his only<br>daughter endued with beautiful brows, named Sukanya. She surrounded by<br>her maids, and decked out with jewels fit for the celestials, while<br>walking about, approached the anthill where Bhrigu's son was seated. And<br>surrounded by her maids, she began to amuse herself there, viewing the<br>beautiful scenery, and looking at the lofty trees of the wood. And she<br>was handsome and in the prime of her youth; and she was amorous and bent<br>on frolicking. And she began to break the twigs of the forest trees<br>bearing blossoms. And Bhrigu's son endued with intelligence beheld her<br>wandering like lightning, without her maids, and wearing a single piece<br>of cloth and decked with ornaments. And seeing her in the lone forest,<br>that ascetic of exceeding effulgence was inspired with desire. And that<br>regenerate Rishi possessing ascetic energy, who had a low voice, called<br>the auspicious one,&#8212;but she heard him not. Then seeing the eyes of<br>Bhrigu's son from the ant-hill, Sukanya from curiosity and losing her<br>sense, said, 'What is this?'&#8212;and with thorns pierced the eyes (of the<br>Rishi). And as his eyes being pierced by her, he felt exceeding pain and<br>became wroth. And (from anger) he obstructed the calls of nature of<br>Saryati's forces. And on their calls of nature being obstructed, the men<br>were greatly afflicted. And seeing this state of things, the king asked.<br>'Who is it that hath done wrong to the illustrious son of Bhrigu, old and<br>ever engaged in austerities and of wrathful temper? Tell me quick if ye<br>know it'. The soldiers (thereupon) answered him saying, 'We do not know<br>whether any one hath done wrong to the Rishi. Do thou, as thou list, make<br>a searching enquiry into the matter. Thereupon that ruler of earth, using<br>(as he saw occasion) both menace and conciliation, asked his friends<br>(about the circumstance). But they too did not know anything. Seeing that<br>the army was distressed owing to the obstruction of the calls of nature,<br>and also finding her father aggrieved, Sukanya said, 'Roving in the<br>forest, I lighted in the ant-hill here upon some brilliant substance.<br>Thereupon taking it for a glow-worm I neared it, and pierced it (with<br>thorns); Hearing this Saryati immediately came to the ant-hill, and there<br>saw Bhrigu's son, old both in years and austerities. Then the lord of<br>earth with joined hands, besought (the ascetic) saying, 'It behoveth thee<br>to forgive what my daughter through ignorance and greenness, hath done<br>unto thee." Chyavana the son of Bhrigu, addressed the monarch saying,<br>'Disregarding me, this one, filled with pride hath pierced my eyes. Even<br>her, O king, endued with beauty and who was bereft of her senses by<br>ignorance and temptation&#8212;even thy daughter would I have for my bride, I<br>tell thee truly, on this condition alone will I forgive thee.'<br><br>Lomasa said, "Hearing the words of the sage, Saryati, without pausing,<br>bestowed his daughter on the high-souled Chyavana. Having received the<br>hand of that girl, the holy one was pleased with the king. And having won<br>the Rishi's grace, the king went to his city, accompanied by his troops.<br>And the faultless Sukanya also having obtained that ascetic for her<br>husband, began to tend him, practising penances, and observing the<br>ordinance. And that one of a graceful countenance, and void of guile<br>worshipped Chyavana, and also ministered unto guests, and the sacred<br>fire."
