                            "Vrihadaswa said, 'Having heard the words of the leader of that caravan,<br>Damayanti of faultless limbs proceeded with that caravan itself anxious<br>to behold her lord. And after having proceeded for many days the<br>merchants saw a large lake fragrant with lotuses in the midst of that<br>dense and terrible forest. And it was beautiful all over, and exceedingly<br>delightful, (with banks) abounding in grass and fuel and fruits and<br>flowers. And it was inhabited by various kinds of fowls and birds, and<br>fall of water that was pure and sweet. And it was cool and capable of<br>captivating the heart. And the caravan, worn out with toil, resolved to<br>halt there. And with the permission of their leader, they spread<br>themselves around those beautiful woods. And that mighty caravan finding<br>it was evening halted at that place. And (it came to pass that) at the<br>hour of midnight when everything was hushed and still and the tired<br>caravan had fallen asleep, a herd of elephants in going towards a<br>mountain stream to drink of its water befouled by their temporal juice,<br>saw that caravan as also the numerous elephants belonging to it. And<br>seeing their domesticated fellows the wild elephants infuriated and with<br>the temporal juice trickling down rushed impetuously on the former, with<br>the intention of killing them. And the force of the rush of those<br>elephants was hard to bear, like the impetuosity of peaks lessened from<br>mountain summits rolling towards the plain. The rushing elephants found<br>the forest paths to be all blocked up, for the goodly caravan was<br>sleeping obstructing the paths around that lake of lotuses. And the<br>elephants all of a sudden, began to crush the men lying insensible on the<br>ground. And uttering cries of 'Oh!' and 'Alas!' the merchants, blinded by<br>sleep, fled, in order to escape that danger, to copses and woods for<br>refuge. And some were slain by the tusks, and some by the trunks, and<br>some by the legs of those elephants. And innumerable camels and horses<br>were killed, and crowds of men on foot, running in fright, killed one<br>another. And uttering loud cries some fell down on the ground, and some<br>in fear climbed on trees, and some dropped down on uneven ground. And, O<br>king, thus accidentally attacked by that large herd of elephants, that<br>goodly caravan suffered a great loss. And there arose a tremendous uproar<br>calculated to frighten the three worlds, 'Lo! a great fire hath broken<br>out. Rescue us.<br><br>Do ye speedily fly away. Why do ye fly? Take the heaps of jewels<br>scattered around. All this wealth is a trifle. I do not speak falsely, 'I<br>tell you again, (exclaimed some one) think on my words, O ye distracted<br>one!' With such exclamation they ran about in fright. And Damayanti awoke<br>in fear and anxiety, while that terrible slaughter was raging there. And<br>beholding slaughter capable of awaking the fear of all the worlds, and<br>which was so unforeseen, the damsel of eyes like lotus leaves rose up,<br>wild with fright, and almost out of breath. And those of the caravan that<br>had escaped unhurt, met together, and asked one another, 'Of what deed of<br>ours is this the consequence? Surely, we have failed to worship the<br>illustrious Manibhadras, and likewise the exalted and graceful<br>Vaisravana, the king of the Yaksha. Perhaps, we have not worshipped the<br>deities that cause calamities, or perhaps, we have not paid them the<br>first homage. Or, perhaps, this evil is the certain consequence of the<br>birds (we saw). Our stars are not unpropitious. From what other cause,<br>then hath this disaster come?' Others, distressed and bereft of wealth<br>and relatives, said, 'That maniac-like woman who came amongst this mighty<br>caravan in guise that was strange and scarcely human, alas, it is by her<br>that this dreadful illusion had been pre-arranged. Of a certainty, she is<br>a terrible Rakshasa or a Yaksha or a Pisacha woman. All this evil is her<br>work, what need of doubts? If we again see that wicked destroyer of<br>merchants, that giver of innumerable woes, we shall certainly slay that<br>injurer of ours, with stones, and dust, and grass, and wood, and cuffs.'<br>And hearing these dreadful words of the merchants, Damayanti, in terror<br>and shame and anxiety, fled into the woods apprehensive of evil. And<br>reproaching herself she said, 'Alas! fierce and great is the wrath of God<br>on me. Peace followeth not in my track. Of what misdeed is this the<br>consequence? I do not remember that I did ever so little a wrong to any<br>one in thought, word, or deed. Of what deed, then, is this the<br>consequence? Certainly, it is on account of the great sins I had<br>committed in a former life that such calamity hath befallen me, viz., the<br>loss of my husband's kingdom, his defeat at the hands of his own kinsmen,<br>this separation from my lord and my son and daughter, this my unprotected<br>state, and my presence in this forest abounding in innumerable beasts of<br>prey!'"<br><br>"The next day, O king, the remnant of that caravan left the place<br>bewailing the destruction that had overtaken them and lamenting for their<br>dead brothers and fathers and sons and friends. And the princess of<br>Vidarbha began to lament, saying, 'Alas! What misdeed have I perpetrated!<br>The crowd of men that I obtained in this lone forest, hath been destroyed<br>by a herd of elephants, surely as a consequence of my ill luck. Without<br>doubt, I shall have to suffer misery for a long time. I have heard from<br>old men that no person dieth ere his time; it is for this that my<br>miserable self hath not been trodden to death by that herd of elephants.<br>Nothing that befalleth men is due to anything else than Destiny, for even<br>in my childhood I did not commit any such sin in thought, word, or deed,<br>whence might come this calamity. Methinks, I suffer this severance from<br>my husband through the potency of those celestial Lokapalas, who had come<br>to the Swayamvara but whom I disregarded for the sake of Nala.' Bewailing<br>thus, O tiger among kings, that excellent lady, Damayanti, devoted to her<br>husband, went, oppressed with grief and (pale) as the autumnal moon, with<br>those Brahmanas versed in the Vedas that had survived the slaughter of<br>the caravan. And departing speedily, towards evening, the damsel came to<br>the mighty city of the truth-telling Suvahu, the king of the Chedis. And<br>she entered that excellent city clad in half a garment. And the citizens<br>saw her as she went, overcome with fear, and lean, melancholy, her hair<br>dishevelled and soiled with dust, and maniac-like. And beholding her<br>enter the city of the king of the Chedis, the boys of the city, from<br>curiosity, began to follow her. And surrounded by them, she came before<br>the palace of the king. And from the terrace the queen-mother saw her<br>surrounded by the crowd. And she said to her nurse, 'Go and bring that<br>woman before me. She is forlorn and is being vexed by the crowd. She hath<br>fallen into distress and standeth in need of succour. I find her beauty<br>to be such that it illumineth my house. The fair one, though looking like<br>a maniac, seemeth a very Sree with her large eyes.' Thus commanded, the<br>nurse went out and dispersing the crowd brought Damayanti to that<br>graceful terrace. And struck with wonder, O king, she asked Damayanti,<br>saying, 'Afflicted though thou art with such distress, thou ownest a<br>beautiful form. Thou shinest like lightning in the midst of the clouds.<br>Tell me who thou art, and whose. O thou possessed of celestial splendour,<br>surely, thy beauty is not human, bereft though thou art of ornaments. And<br>although thou art helpless, yet thou art unmoved under the outrage of<br>these men.' Hearing these words of the nurse, the daughter of Bhima said,<br>Know that I am a female belonging to the human species and devoted to my<br>husband. I am a serving woman of good lineage. I live wherever I like,<br>subsisting on fruit and roots, and whom a companion, and stay where<br>evening overtaketh me. My husband is the owner of countless virtues and<br>was ever devoted to me. And I also, on my part, was deeply attached to<br>him, following him like his shadow. It chanced that once he became<br>desperately engaged at dice. Defeated at dice, he came along into the<br>forest. I accompanied my husband into the woods, comforting the hero clad<br>in a single piece of cloth and maniac-like and overwhelmed with calamity.<br>Once on a time for some cause, that hero, afflicted with hunger and<br>thirst and grief, was forced to abandon that sole piece of covering in<br>the forest. Destitute of garment and maniac-like and deprived of his<br>senses as he was, I followed him, myself in a single garment. Following<br>him, I did not sleep for nights together. Thus passed many days, until at<br>last while I was sleeping, he cut off half of my cloth, and forsook me<br>who had done him no wrong. I am seeking my husband but unable to find him<br>who is of hue like the filaments of the lotus, without being able to cast<br>my eyes on that delight of my heart, that dear lord who owneth my heart<br>and resembleth the celestials in mien, day and night do I burn in grief."<br><br>"Unto Bhima's daughter thus lamenting with tearful eyes, and afflicted<br>and speaking in accents choked in grief, the queen-mother herself said,<br>'O blessed damsel, do thou stay with me. I am well pleased with thee. O<br>fair lady, my men shall search for thy husband. Or, perhaps he may come<br>here of his own accord in course of his wanderings. And, O beautiful<br>lady, residing here thou wilt regain thy (lost) lord.' Hearing these<br>words of the queen mother, Damayanti replied, 'O mother of heroes, I may<br>stay with thee on certain conditions. I shall not eat the leavings on any<br>dish, nor shall I wash anybody's feet, nor shall I have to speak with<br>other men. And if anybody shall seek me (as a wife or mistress) he should<br>be liable to punishment at thy hands. And, further, should he solicit me<br>over and over again, that wicked one should be punished with death. This<br>is the vow I have made. I intend to have an interview with those<br>Brahmanas that will set out to search for my husband. If thou canst do<br>all this, I shall certainly live with thee. If it is otherwise, I cannot<br>find it in my heart to reside with thee.' The queen-mother answered her<br>with a glad heart, saying, 'I will do all this. Thou hast done well in<br>adopting such a vow!'"<br><br>"Vrihadaswa continued, 'O king, having spoken so unto the daughter of<br>Bhima, the queen-mother, O Bharata, said to her daughter named Sunanda,<br>'O Sunanda, accept this lady like a goddess as thy Sairindhri! Let her be<br>thy companion, as she is of the same age with thee. Do thou, with heart<br>free from care, always sport with her in joy.' And Sunanda cheerfully<br>accepted Damayanti and led her to her own apartment accompanied by her<br>associates. And treated with respect, Damayanti was satisfied, and she<br>continued to reside there without anxiety of any kind, for all her wishes<br>were duly gratified.'"
