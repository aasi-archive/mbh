                            "Sudeva said, 'There is a virtuous and illustrious ruler of the<br>Vidarbhas, Bhima by name. This blessed lady is his daughter, and widely<br>known by the name of Damayanti. And there is a king ruling the Nishadhas,<br>named Nala, the son of Virasena. This blessed lady is the wife of that<br>wise and righteous monarch. Defeated at dice by his brother, and<br>despoiled of his kingdom, that king, accompanied by Damayanti, went away<br>without the knowledge of any one. We have been wandering over the whole<br>earth in search of Damayanti. And that girl is at last found in the house<br>of thy son. No woman existeth that is her rival in beauty. Between the<br>eye-brows of this ever-youthful damsel, there is an excellent mole from<br>birth, resembling a lotus. Noticed by us (before) it seems to have<br>disappeared, covered, (as her forehead is) with (a coat of) dust even<br>like the moon hid in clouds. Placed there by the Creator himself as an<br>indication of prosperity and wealth, that mole is visible faintly, like<br>the cloud-covered lunar crescent of the first day of the lighted<br>fortnight. And covered as her body is with dust, her beauty hath not<br>disappeared. Though careless of her person, it is still manifest, and<br>shineth like gold. And this girl&#8212;goddess-like&#8212;capable of being<br>identified by this form of hers and that mole, hath been discovered by me<br>as one discovereth a fire that is covered, by its heat!'<br><br>"O king, hearing these words of Sudeva, Sunanda washed the dust that<br>covered the mole between Damayanti's eye-brows. And thereupon it became<br>visible like the moon in the sky, just emerged from the clouds. And<br>seeing that mole, O Bharata, Sunanda and the queen-mother began to weep,<br>and embracing Damayanti stood silent for a while. And the queen-mother,<br>shedding tears as she spoke, said in gentle accents, 'By this thy mole, I<br>find that thou art the daughter of my sister. O beauteous girl, thy<br>mother and I are both daughters of the high-souled Sudaman, the ruler of<br>the Dasarnas. She was bestowed upon king Bhima, and I on Viravahu. I<br>witnessed thy birth at our father's palace in the country of the<br>Dasarnas. O beautiful one, my house is to thee even as thy father's. And<br>this wealth, O Damayanti, is thine as much as mine.' As this, O king,<br>Damayanti bowing down to her mother's sister with a glad heart, spake<br>unto her these words, 'Unrecognised, I have still lived happily with<br>thee, every want of mine satisfied and myself cared for by thee. And<br>happy as my stay hath been, it would, without doubt, be happier still.<br>But, mother, I have long been an exile. It behoveth thee, therefore, to<br>grant me permission (to depart). My son and daughter, sent to my father's<br>palace, are living there. Deprived of their father, and of their mother<br>also, how are they passing their days stricken with sorrow. If thou<br>wishest to do what is agreeable to me, do thou without loss of time,<br>order a vehicle, for I wish to go to the Vidarbhas.' At this, O king, the<br>sister to (Damayanti's) mother, with a glad heart, said, 'So be it'. And<br>the queen-mother with her son's permission, O chief of the Bharatas, sent<br>Damayanti in handsome litter carried by men, protected by a large escort<br>and provided with food and drink and garments of the first quality. And<br>soon enough she reached the country of the Vidarbhas. And all her<br>relatives, rejoicing (in her arrival) received her with respect. And<br>seeing her relatives, her children, both her parents, and all her maids,<br>to be well, the illustrious Damayanti, O king, worshipped the gods and<br>Brahmanas according to the superior method. And the king rejoiced at<br>beholding his daughter gave unto Sudeva a thousand kine and much wealth<br>and a village. And, O king, having spent that night at her father's<br>mansion and recovered from fatigue, Damayanti addressed her mother,<br>saying, 'O mother, if thou wishest me to live, I tell thee truly, do thou<br>endeavour to bring Nala, that hero among men.' Thus addressed by<br>Damayanti, the venerable queen became filled with sorrow. And bathed in<br>tears, she was unable to give any answer. And beholding her in that<br>plight, all the inmates of the inner apartments broke out into<br>exclamation of 'Oh!' And 'Alas'! and began to cry bitterly. And then the<br>queen addressed the mighty monarch Bhima, saying, 'Thy daughter Damayanti<br>mourneth on account of her husband. Nay, banishing away all bashfulness,<br>she hath herself, O king, declared her mind to me. Let thy men strive to<br>find out (Nala) the righteous.' Thus informed by her the king sent the<br>Brahmanas under him in all directions, saying, 'Exert ye to discover<br>Nala.' And those Brahmanas, commanded by the ruler of the Vidarbhas (to<br>seek Nala) appeared before Damayanti and told her of the journey they<br>were about to undertake. And Bhima's daughter spake unto them saying, 'Do<br>ye cry in every realm and in every assembly, 'O beloved gambler, where<br>hast thou gone cutting off half of my garment, and deserting the dear and<br>devoted wife asleep in the forest? And that girl, as commanded by thee<br>stayeth expecting thee, clad in half a piece of cloth and burning with<br>grief! O king, O hero, relent towards, and answer, her who incessantly<br>weepeth for that grief. This and more ye will say, so that he may be<br>inclined to pity me. Assisted by the wind, fire consumeth the forest.<br>(Further, ye will say that) the wife is always to be protected and<br>maintained by the husband. Why then, good as thou art and acquainted with<br>every duty, hast thou neglected both the duties? Possessed of fame and<br>wisdom, and lineage, and kindness, why hast thou be unkind? I fear, this<br>is owing to the loss of my good luck! Therefore, O tiger among men, have<br>pity on me. O bull among men! I have heard it from thee that kindness is<br>the highest virtue. Speaking so, if anybody answereth you, that person<br>should by all means, be known, and ye should learn who he is, and where<br>he dwelleth. And ye foremost of regenerate ones, do ye bring me the words<br>of him who hearing this your speech will chance to answer. Ye should also<br>act with such care that no one may know the words ye utter to be at my<br>command, nor that ye will come back to me. And ye should also learn<br>whether that answers is wealthy, or poor, or destitute of power, in fact<br>all about him.'<br><br>"Thus instructed by Damayanti, O king, the Brahmanas set out in all<br>directions in search of Nala overtaken with such disaster. And the<br>Brahmanas, O king, searched for him in cities and kingdoms and villages,<br>and retreats of ascetics, and places inhabited by cow-herds. And, O<br>monarch, wherever they went they recited the speeches that Damayanti had<br>directed them to do."
