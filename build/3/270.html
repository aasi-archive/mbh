                            Vaisampayana said, "Jayadratha flying for his life upon beholding those<br>two brothers with upraised arms, was sorely grieved and bolted off with<br>speed and coolness. But the mighty and indignant Bhimasena, descending<br>from his chariot, ran after him thus fleeing, and seized him by the hair<br>of his head. And holding him high up in the air, Bhima thrust him on the<br>ground with violence. And seizing the prince by the head, he knocked him<br>about. And when the wretch recovered consciousness, he groaned aloud and<br>wanted to get up on his legs. But that hero endued with mighty arms<br>kicked him on the head. And Bhima pressed him on the breast with his<br>knees as well as with his fists. And the prince thus belaboured, soon<br>became insensible. Then Falguna dissuaded the wrathful Bhimasena from<br>inflicting further chastisement on the prince, by reminding him of what<br>Yudhishthira had said regarding (their sister) Dussala. But Bhima<br>replied, saying, 'This sinful wretch hath done a cruel injury to Krishna,<br>who never can bear such treatment. He, therefore, deserveth to die at<br>hands! But what can I do? The king is always overflowing with mercy, and<br>thou, too, art constantly putting obstacles in my way from a childish<br>sense of virtue!' Having said these words, Vrikodara, with his<br>crescent-shaped arrow, shaved the hair of the prince's head, heaving five<br>tufts in as many places. Jayadratha uttered not a word at this. Then<br>Vrikodara, addressing the foe said, 'If thou wishest to live, listen to<br>me. O fool! I shall tell thee the means to attain that wish! In public<br>assemblies and in open courts thou must say,&#8212;I am the slave of the<br>Pandavas.&#8212;on this condition alone, I will pardon thee thy life! This is<br>the customary rule of conquest on the field of battle.' Thus addressed<br>and treated, king Jayadratha said to the mighty and fierce warrior who<br>always looked awful, 'Be it so!' And he was trembling and senseless and<br>begrimed with dust. Then Arjuna and Vrikodara, securing him with chains,<br>thrust him into a chariot. And Bhima, himself mounting that chariot, and<br>accompanied by Arjuna, drove towards the hermitage. And approaching<br>Yudhishthira seated there, he placed Jayadratha in that condition before<br>the king. And the king, smiling, told him to set the Sindhu prince at<br>liberty. Then Bhima said unto the king, 'Do thou tell Draupadi that this<br>wretch hath become the slave of the Pandavas.' Then his eldest brother<br>said unto him affectionately, 'If thou hast any regard for us, do thou<br>set this wretch at liberty!' And Draupadi too, reading the king's mind,<br>said, 'Let him off! He hath become a slave of the king's and thou, too,<br>hast disfigured him by leaving five tufts of hair on his head.' Then that<br>crest-fallen prince, having obtained his liberty, approached king<br>Yudhishthira and bowed down unto him. And seeing those Munis there, he<br>saluted them also. Then the kind-hearted king Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Dharma, beholding Jayadratha in that condition, almost supported by<br>Arjuna, said unto him, 'Thou art a free man now; I emancipate thee! Now<br>go away and be careful not to do such thing again; shame to thee! Thou<br>hadst intended to take away a lady by violence, even though thou art so<br>mean and powerless! What other wretch save thee would think of acting<br>thus?" Then that foremost king of Bharata's race eyed with pity that<br>perpetrator of wicked deeds, and believing that he had lost his senses,<br>said, 'Mayst thy heart grow in virtue! Never set thy heart again on<br>immoral deeds! Thou mayst depart in peace now with thy charioteers,<br>cavalry and infantry.' Thus addressed by Yudhishthira, the prince, O<br>Bharata, was overpowered with shame, and bending down his head, he<br>silently and sorrowfully wended his way to the place where the Ganga<br>debouches on the plains. And imploring the protection of the god of three<br>eyes, the consort of Uma, he did severe penance at that place. And the<br>three-eyed god, pleased with his austerities deigned to accept his<br>offerings in person. And he also granted him a boon! Do thou listen, O<br>monarch, how the prince received that boon! Jayadratha, addressing that<br>god, asked the boon, 'May I be able to defeat in battle all the five sons<br>of Pandu on their chariots!' The god, however, told him 'This cannot be.'<br>And Maheswara said, 'None can slay or conquer them in battle. Save<br>Arjuna, however, thou shall be able to only check them (once) on the<br>field of battle! The heroic Arjuna, with mighty arms, is the god<br>incarnate styled Nara. He practised austerities of old in the Vadari<br>forest. The God Narayana is his friend. Therefore, he is unconquerable of<br>the very gods. I myself have given him the celestial weapon called<br>Pasupata. From the regents also of all the ten cardinal points, he has<br>acquired the thunder-bolt and other mighty weapons. And the great god<br>Vishnu who is the Infinite Spirit, the Lord Preceptor of all the gods, is<br>the Supreme Being without attributes, and the Soul of the Universe, and<br>existeth pervading the whole creation. At the termination of a cycle of<br>ages, assuming the shape of the all-consuming fire, he consumed the whole<br>Universe with mountains and seas and islands and hills and woods and<br>forests. And after the destruction of the Naga world also in the<br>subterranean regions in the same way, vast masses of many-coloured and<br>loud-pealing clouds, with streaks of lightning, spreading along the<br>entire welkin, had appeared on high. Then pouring down water in torrents<br>thick as axles of cars, and filling the space everywhere, these<br>extinguishing that all-consuming fire! When at the close of four thousand<br>Yugas the Earth thus became flooded with water, like one vast sea, and<br>all mobile creatures were hushed in death, and the sun and the moon and<br>the winds were all destroyed, and the Universe was devoid of planets and<br>stars, the Supreme Being called Narayana, unknowable by the senses,<br>adorned with a thousand heads and as many eyes and legs, became desirous<br>of rest. And the serpent Sesha, looking terrible with his thousand hoods,<br>and shining with the splendour of ten thousand suns, and white as the<br>Kunda flower or the moon or a string of pearls, or the white lotus, or<br>milk, or the fibres of a lotus stalk, served for his conch. And that<br>adorable and omnipotent God thus slept on the bosom of the deep,<br>enveloping all space with nocturnal gloom. And when his creative faculty<br>was excited, he awoke and found the Universe denuded of everything. In<br>this connection, the following sloka is recited respecting the meaning of<br>Narayana. "Water was created by (the Rishi) Nara, and it formed his<br>corpus; therefore do we hear it styled as Nara. And because it formed his<br>Ayana (resting-place) therefore is he known as Narayana." As soon as that<br>everlasting Being was engaged in meditation for the re-creation of the<br>Universe, a lotus flower instantaneously came into existence from his<br>navel, and the four-faced Brahma came out of that navel-lotus. And then<br>the Grandsire of all creatures, seating himself on that flower and<br>finding that the whole Universe was a blank, created in his own likeness,<br>and from his will, the (nine) great Rishis, Marichi and others. And these<br>in their turn observing the same thing, completed the creation, by<br>creating Yakshas, Rakshas, Pisachas, reptiles, men, and all mobile and<br>immobile creatures. The Supreme Spirit hath three conditions. In the form<br>of Brahma, he is the Creator, and in the form of Vishnu he is the<br>Preserver, and in his form as Rudra, he is the Destroyer of the Universe!<br>O king of Sindhu, hast thou not heard of the wonderful achievements of<br>Vishnu, described to thee by the Munis and the Brahmanas learned in the<br>Vedas? When the world was thus reduced to one vast sea of water, with<br>only the heavens above, the Lord, like a fire-fly at night-time during<br>the rainy season, moved about hither and thither in search of stable<br>ground, with the view of rehabilitating his creation, and became desirous<br>of raising the Earth submerged in water. What shape shall I take to<br>rescue the Earth from this flood?&#8212;So thinking and contemplating with<br>divine insight, he bethought himself of the shape of a wild boar fond of<br>sporting in water. And assuming the shape of a sacrificial boar shining<br>with effulgence and instinct with the Vedas and ten Yojanas in length,<br>with pointed tusks and a complexion like dark clouds, and with a body<br>huge as a mountain, and roaring like a conglomeration of clouds, the Lord<br>plunged into the waters, and lifted up the Earth with one of his tusks,<br>and replaced it in its proper sphere. At another time, the mighty Lord,<br>assuming a wonderful form with a body half lion, half man, and squeezing<br>his hands, repaired to the court of the ruler of the Daityas. That<br>progenitor of the Daityas, the son of Diti, who was the enemy of the<br>(gods), beholding the Lord's peculiar form, burst out into passion and<br>his eyes became inflamed with rage. And Hiranya-Kasipu, the war-like son<br>of Diti and the enemy of the gods, adorned with garlands and looking like<br>a mass of dark clouds, taking up his trident in hand and roaring like the<br>clouds, rushed on that being half lion, half man. Then that powerful king<br>of wild beasts, half man, half lion, taking a leap in the air, instantly<br>rent the Daitya in twain by means of his sharp claws. And the adorable<br>lotus-eyed Lord of great effulgence, having thus slain the Daitya king<br>for the well-being of all creatures, again took his birth in the womb of<br>Aditi as son of Kasyapa. And at the expiration of a thousand years she<br>was delivered of that superhuman conception. And then was born that<br>Being, of the hue of rain-charged clouds with bright eyes and of dwarfish<br>stature. He had the ascetic's staff and water-pot in hand, and was marked<br>with the emblem of a curl of hair on the breast. And that adorable Being<br>wore matted locks and the sacrificial thread, and he was stout and<br>handsome and resplendent with lustre. And that Being, arriving at the<br>sacrificial enclosure of Vali, king of the Danavas, entered the<br>sacrificial assembly with the aid of Vrihaspati. And beholding that<br>dwarf-bodied Being, Vali was well-pleased and said unto him, 'I am glad<br>to see thee, O Brahmana! Say what is it that thou wantest from me!' Thus<br>addressed by Vali, the dwarf-god replied with a smile, saying, 'So be it!<br>Do thou, lord of the Danavas, give me three paces of ground!' And Vali<br>contented to give what that Brahmana of infinite power had asked. And<br>while measuring with his paces the space he sought. Hari assumed a<br>wonderful and extraordinary form. And with only three paces he instantly<br>covered this illimitable world. And then that everlasting God, Vishnu,<br>gave it away unto Indra. This history which has just been related to<br>thee, is celebrated as the 'Incarnation of the Dwarf', And from him, all<br>the gods had their being, and after him the world is said to be<br>Vaishnava, or pervaded by Vishnu. And for the destruction of the wicked<br>and the preservation of religion, even He hath taken his birth among men<br>in the race of the Yadus. And the adorable Vishnu is styled Krishna.<br>These, O king of Sindhu, are the achievements of the Lord whom all the<br>worlds worship and whom the learned describe as without beginning and<br>without end, unborn and Divine! They call Him, the unconquerable Krishna<br>with conchshell, discus and mace, and adorned with the emblem of a curl<br>of hair, Divine, clad in silken robes of yellow hue, and the best of<br>those versed in the art of war. Arjuna is protected by Krishna the<br>possessor of these attributes. That glorious and lotus-eyed Being of<br>infinite power, that slayer of hostile heroes, riding in the same chariot<br>with Pritha's son, protecteth him! He is, therefore, invincible; the very<br>gods cannot resist his power, still less can one with human attributes<br>vanquish the son of Pritha in battle! Therefore, O king, thou must let<br>him alone! Thou shalt, however, be able to vanquish for a single day<br>only, the rest of Yudhishthira's forces along with thine enemies&#8212;the<br>four sons of Pandu!"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having said these words unto that prince, the<br>adorable Hara of three eyes, the destroyer of all sins, the consort of<br>Uma, and lord of wild beasts, the destroyer of (Daksha's) sacrifice, the<br>slayer of Tripura and He that had plucked out the eyes of Bhaga,<br>surrounded by his dwarfish and hunch-backed and terrible followers having<br>frightful eyes and ears and uplifted arms, vanished, O tiger among kings,<br>from that place with his consort Uma! And the wicked Jayadratha also<br>returned home, and the sons of Pandu continued to dwell in the forest of<br>Kamyaka."
