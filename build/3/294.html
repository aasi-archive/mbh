                            "Markandeya said, 'At length, O king, after a long time had passed away,<br>the hour that had been appointed for the death of Satyavan arrived. And<br>as the words that had been spoken by Narada were ever present in the mind<br>of Savitri, she had counted the days as they passed. And having<br>ascertained that her husband would die on the fourth day following, the<br>damsel fasted day and night, observing the Triratra vow. And hearing of<br>her vow, the king became exceedingly sorrow and rising up soothed Savitri<br>and said these words, 'This vow that thou hast begun to observe, O<br>daughter of a king, is exceedingly hard; for it is extremely difficult to<br>fast for three nights together!' And hearing these words, Savitri said,<br>'Thou needst not be sorry, O father! This vow I shall be able to observe!<br>I have for certain undertaken this task with perseverance; and<br>perseverance is the cause of the successful observance of vows.' And<br>having listened to her, Dyumatsena said, 'I can by no means say unto<br>thee, Do thou break thy vow. One like me should, on the contrary,<br>say,&#8212;Do thou complete thy vow!' And having said this to her, the<br>high-minded Dyumatsena stopped. And Savitri continuing to fast began to<br>look (lean) like a wooden doll. And, O bull of the Bharata race, thinking<br>that her husband would die on the morrow, the woe-stricken Savitri,<br>observing a fast, spent that night in extreme anguish. And when the Sun<br>had risen about a couple of hand Savitri thinking within herself&#8212;To-day<br>is that day, finished her morning rites, and offered oblations to the<br>flaming fire. And bowing down unto the aged Brahmanas, and her<br>father-in-law, and mother-in-law, she stood before them with joined<br>hands, concentrating her senses. And for the welfare of Savitri, all the<br>ascetics dwelling in that hermitage, uttered the auspicious benediction<br>that she should never suffer widowhood. And Savitri immersed in<br>contemplation accepted those words of the ascetics, mentally saying,&#8212;So<br>be it!&#8212;And the king's daughter, reflecting on those words of Narada,<br>remained, expecting the hour and the moment.<br><br>Then, O best of the Bharatas, well-pleased, her father-in-law and<br>mother-in-law said these words unto the princess seated in a corner,<br>'Thou hast completed the vow as prescribed. The time for thy meal hath<br>now arrived; therefore, do thou what is proper!' Thereat Savitri said,<br>'Now that I have completed the purposed vow, I will eat when the Sun goes<br>down. Even this is my heart's resolve and this my vow!'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'And when Savitri had spoken thus about her meal,<br>Satyavan, taking his axe upon his shoulders, set out for the woods. And<br>at this, Savitri said unto her husband, 'It behoveth thee not to go<br>alone! I will accompany thee. I cannot bear to be separated from thee!'<br>Hearing these words of hers, Satyavan said, 'Thou hast never before<br>repaired to the forest. And, O lady, the forest-paths are hard to pass!<br>Besides thou hast been reduced by fast on account of thy vow. How wouldst<br>thou, therefore, be able to walk on foot?' Thus addressed, Savitri said,<br>'I do not feel langour because of the fast, nor do I feel exhaustion. And<br>I have made up my mind to go. It behoveth thee not, therefore, to prevent<br>me!' At this, Satyavan said, 'If thou desirest to go, I will gratify that<br>desire of thine. Do thou, however, take the permission of my parents, so<br>that I may be guilty of no fault!'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Thus addressed by her lord, Savitri of high vows<br>saluted her father-in-law and mother-in-law and addressed them, saying,<br>'This my husband goeth to the forest for procuring fruits. Permitted by<br>my revered lady-mother and father-in-law, I will accompany him. For<br>to-day I cannot bear to be separated from him. Thy son goeth out for the<br>sake of the sacrificial fire and for his reverend superiors. He ought<br>not, therefore, to be dissuaded. Indeed, he could be dissuaded if he went<br>into the forest on any other errand. Do ye not prevent me! I will go into<br>the forest with him. It is a little less than a year that I have not gone<br>out of the asylum. Indeed, I am extremely desirous of beholding the<br>blossoming woods!' Hearing these words Dyumatsena said, 'Since Savitri<br>hath been bestowed by her father as my daughter-in-law, I do not remember<br>that she hath ever spoken any words couching a request. Let my<br>daughter-in-law, therefore, have her will in this matter. Do thou,<br>however, O daughter, act in such a way that Satyavan's work may not be<br>neglected!'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Having received the permission of both, the<br>illustrious Savitri, departed with her lord, in seeming smiles although<br>her heart was racked with grief. And that lady of large eyes went on,<br>beholding picturesque and delightful woods inhabited by swarms of<br>peacocks. And Satyavan sweetly said unto Savitri, 'Behold these rivers of<br>sacred currents and these excellent trees decked with flowers!' But the<br>faultless Savitri continued to watch her lord in all his moods, and<br>recollecting the words of the celestial sage, she considered her husband<br>as already dead. And with heart cleft in twain, that damsel, replying to<br>her lord, softly followed him expecting that hour.'"
