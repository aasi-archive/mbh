                            Vaisampayana said, "Having, O great king, heard from the illustrious<br>Markandeya the history of the attainment of heaven by the royal sage<br>Indradyumna, Yudhishthira, that bull of the Bharata race, once more asked<br>that sinless Muni endued with great ascetic merit and long life, saying,<br>'Thou knowest, O virtuous one, the entire host of the gods, the Danavas,<br>and the Rakshasas. Thou art acquainted also with various royal<br>genealogies and many eternal lines of Rishis! O best of Brahmanas, there<br>is nothing in this world that thou dost not know! Thou knowest also, O<br>Muni, many delightful stories about men, Snakes and Rakshasas; about<br>gods, Gandharvas, and Yakshas, and about Kinnaras and Apsaras! I desire<br>now to hear from thee, O best of Brahmanas, as to why Kuvalaswa&#8212;that<br>unvanquished king of Ikshavaku's race changed his name, assuming another,<br>viz., Dhundhumara. O thou best of Bhrigu's line, I desire to know in<br>detail why the name of Kuvalaswa of great intelligence underwent such a<br>change!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed by Yudhishthira, the great Muni<br>Markandeya, O Bharata, then began the history of Dhundhumara!"<br><br>Markandeya said, 'O royal Yudhishthira, listen to me, I will tell thee<br>all! The story of Dhundhumara is a moral one. Listen to it then! Listen<br>now, O king, to the story of how the royal Kuvalaswa of Ikshvaku's race<br>came to be known as Dhundhumara. O son, O Bharata, there was a celebrated<br>Rishi of the name of Utanka and, O thou of the Kuru race, Utanka had his<br>hermitage in a delightful wilderness. And, O great king, the Rishi Utanka<br>underwent ascetic austerities of the severest kind and the lord Utanka<br>underwent those penances for numberless years with the object of<br>obtaining the favours of Vishnu, and gratified with his penances that<br>illustrious Lord presented himself before Utanka. And beholding the<br>Deity, the Rishi in all humility began to gratify him with many hymns,<br>and Utanka said, 'O thou of great effulgence all creatures with the gods,<br>Asuras and human beings, all things that are mobile or immobile, even<br>Brahma himself, the Vedas, and all things that are capable of being<br>known, have, O lord, been created by thee! The firmament is thy head, O<br>god, and the sun and the moon are thy eyes! And, O Unfading One, the<br>winds are thy breath and fire thy energy! The directions of the horizon<br>constitute thy arms and the great ocean thy stomach! And, O god, the<br>hills and mountains constitute thy thigh and the sky thy hips, O slayer<br>of Madhu! The earth constitutes thy feet, and the plants the bristles on<br>thy body. And, O lord, Indra and Soma and Agni and Varuna, indeed all the<br>gods, the Asuras and the great Snakes all wait upon thee with humility,<br>adoring thee with various hymns! O Lord of the Universe, created things<br>are pervaded by thee. The great Rishis of high energy and ever plunged in<br>ascetic meditation, always adore thee. When thou art gratified, the<br>universe is in peace. And when thou art angry, terror pervadeth every<br>soul. Thou art, O Lord, the great dispeller of all terrors and thou art<br>the One Supreme Male Being! Thou art the cause of happiness of both gods<br>and human beings! And, O Lord, by three steps of thine thou didst cover<br>the three worlds! And it was by thee that the Asuras in the height of<br>their power were destroyed! It is owing to thy prowess, O God, that the<br>celestials obtained peace and happiness and, O thou of great effulgence,<br>it was the anger that destroyed hundred great Daitya chiefs. Thou art the<br>Creator and destroyer of all creatures in the world. It is by adoring<br>thee that the gods have obtained happiness. It was thus, O Yudhishthira,<br>that the high-souled Utanka praised the Lord of the senses. And Vishnu,<br>therefore, said unto Utanka, 'I am gratified with thee. Ask thou the boon<br>that thou desirest.' And Utanka said, 'This indeed hath, been a great<br>boon to me, in that I have been able to behold Hari, that eternal Being,<br>that divine Creator, that Lord of the universe!" Thus addressed Vishnu<br>said, 'I am gratified with this absence of all desires on thy pail and<br>with thy devotion, O thou best of men! But, O Brahmanas, O regenerate<br>one, thou shouldst of a certainty accept some boon from me! Thus<br>requested by Hari to accept a boon Utanka then, O thou best of Bharatas,<br>with joined hands begged a boon saying, 'O illustrious one, O thou of<br>eyes like lotus leaves, if thou hast been gratified with me, then let my<br>heart always rest on virtue, truth, and self-content. And, O Lord, let my<br>heart always turn to thee in devotion.' And hearing these words of<br>Utanka, the holy one said, 'O regenerate one, all this shall happen to<br>thee through my grace. And there will also appear in thee a yoga power<br>endued with which thou shalt achieve a great thing for the dwellers of<br>Heaven, as also for the triple world. Even now a great Asura of the name<br>of Dhundhu is undergoing ascetic penances of fierce austerity with the<br>object of destroying the triple world. Hear now as to who will slay that<br>Asura. O son, there will appear a king of invincible energy and great<br>prowess and he will be born in the race of Ikshvaku and will be known by<br>the name of Vrihadaswa who will have a son of the name of Kuvalaswa<br>endued with great holiness and self-control and celebrity. And that best<br>of kings will be furnished with yoga power springing from me and urged<br>and commended by thee, O regenerate Rishi, that king will be the slayer<br>of the Asura Dhundhu.' And having said these words unto that Brahmana,<br>Vishnu disappeared there and then."
