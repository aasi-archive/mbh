                            "Vrihadaswa said, 'After Rituparna of prowess incapable of being baffled<br>had, in the evening, arrived at the city of the Vidarbhas, the people<br>brought unto king Bhima the tidings (of his arrival). And at the<br>invitation of Bhima, the king (of Ayodhya) entered the city of Kundina,<br>filling with the rattle of his car all the ten points, direct and<br>transverse, of the horizon. And the steeds of Nala that were in that city<br>heard that sound, and hearing it they became delighted as they used to be<br>in the presence of Nala himself. And Damayanti also heard the sound of<br>that car driven by Nala, like the deep roar of the clouds in the rainy<br>season. And Bhima and the steeds (of Nala) regarded the clatter of that<br>car to be like that which they used to hear in days of yore when king<br>Nala himself urged his own steeds. And the peacocks on the terraces, and<br>the elephants in the stables, and the horses also, all heard the rattle<br>of Rituparna's car. And hearing the sound, so like the roar of the<br>clouds, the elephants and the peacocks, O king, began to utter their<br>cries, facing that direction, and filled with delight such as they<br>experience when they hear the actual roar of the clouds. And Damayanti<br>said, 'Because the rattle of his car filling the whole earth, gladdens my<br>heart, it must be King Nala (that has come). If I do not see Nala, of<br>face bright as the moon, that hero with countless virtues, I shall<br>certainly die. If I am not clasped today in that hero's thrilling<br>embrace, I shall certainly cease to be. If Naishadha with voice deep as<br>that of the clouds doth not come to me today, I shall enter into a pyre<br>of golden brilliance. If that foremost of kings, powerful as a lion and<br>gifted with the strength of an infuriated elephant, doth not present<br>himself before me, I shall certainly cease to live. I do not remember a<br>single untruth in him, or a single wrong done by him to others. Never<br>hath he spoken an untruth even in jest. Oh, my Nala is exalted and<br>forgiving and heroic and magnificent and superior to all other kings, and<br>faithful to his marriage vow and like unto a eunuch in respect of other<br>females. Night and day dwelling upon his perceptions, my heart, in<br>absence of that dear one, is about to burst in grief.'<br><br>"Thus bewailing as if devoid of sense, Damayanti, O Bharata, ascended the<br>terrace (of her mansion) with the desire of seeing the righteous Nala.<br>And in the yard of the central mansion she beheld king Rituparna on the<br>car with Varshneya and Vahuka. And Varshneya and Vahuka, descending for<br>that excellent vehicle, unyoked the steeds, and kept the vehicle itself<br>in a proper place. And king Rituparna also, descending from the car,<br>presented himself before king Bhima possessed of terrible prowess. And<br>Bhima received him with great respect, for in the absence of a proper<br>occasion, a great person cannot be had (as a guest). And honoured by<br>Bhima, king Rituparna looked about him again and again, but saw no traces<br>of the Swayamvara. And the ruler of the Vidarbhas, O Bharata, approaching<br>Rituparna, said, 'Welcome! What is the occasion of this thy visit?' And<br>king Bhima asked this without knowing that Rituparna had come to obtain<br>the hand of his daughter. And king Rituparna, of unbaffled prowess and<br>gifted with intelligence, saw that there were no other kings or princes.<br>Nor did he hear any talk relating to the Swayamvara, nor saw any<br>concourse of Brahmanas. And at this, the king of Kosala reflected a while<br>and at length said, 'I have come here to pay my respects to thee.' And<br>the king Bhima was struck with astonishment, and reflected upon the<br>(probable) cause of Rituparna's coming, having passed over a hundred<br>yojanas. And he reflected, 'That passing by other sovereigns, and leaving<br>behind him innumerable countries, he should come simply to pay his<br>respect to me is scarcely the reason of his arrival. What he assigneth to<br>be the cause of his coming appeareth to be a trifle. However, I shall<br>learn the true reason in the future.' And although king Bhima thought so,<br>he did not dismiss Rituparna summarily, but said unto him again and<br>again, 'Rest, thou art weary.' And honoured thus by the pleased Bhima,<br>king Rituparna was satisfied, and with a delighted heart, he went to his<br>appointed quarters followed by the servants of the royal household."<br><br>"Vrihadaswa continued, 'And, O king, after Rituparna had gone away with<br>Varshneya, Vahuka took the car to the stables. And there freeing the<br>steeds, and tending them according to rule, and soothing them himself,<br>sat down on a side of the car. Meanwhile, the princess of Vidharva,<br>Damayanti, afflicted with grief, having beheld the royal son of<br>Bhangasura, and Varshneya of the Suta race, and also Vahuka in that<br>guise, asked herself, 'Whose is this car-rattle? It was loud as that of<br>Nala, but I do not see the ruler of the Nishadhas. Certainly, Varshneya<br>hath learnt the art from Nala, and it is for this the rattle of the car<br>driven by him hath been even like that of Nala. Or, is Rituparna equally<br>skilled with Nala so that the rattle of his car seemeth to be like that<br>of Nala?' And reflecting thus, O monarch, the blessed and beauteous girl<br>sent a female messenger in search of Nishada."
