                            Vaisampayana said, "When that foremost of Brahmanas had gone away on some<br>other errand, the maiden began to ponder over the virtue of those<br>mantras. And she said to herself, 'Of what nature are those mantras that<br>have been bestowed on me by that high-souled one? I shall without delay<br>test their power'. And as she was thinking in this way, she suddenly<br>perceived indications of the approach of her season. And her season<br>having arrived, while she was yet unmarried, she blushed in shame. And it<br>came to pass that as she was seated in her chamber on a rich bed, she<br>beheld the solar orb rising in the east. And both the mind and the eyes<br>of that maiden of excellent waist became rivetted fast upon the solar<br>orb. And she gazed and gazed on that orb without being satiated with the<br>beauty of the morning Sun. And she suddenly became gifted with celestial<br>sight. And then she beheld that god of divine form accoutred in mail and<br>adorned with ear-rings. And at sight of the god, O lord of men, she<br>became curious as to the (potency of the) mantras. And thereupon that<br>maiden resolved to invoke him. And having recourse to Pranayama, she<br>invoked the Maker of day. And thus invoked by her, O king, the Maker of<br>day speedily presented himself. And he was of a yellowish hue like honey,<br>and was possessed of mighty arms, and his neck was marked with lines like<br>those of a conchshell. And furnished with armlets, and decked with a<br>diadem, he came smiling, and illumining all the directions. And it was by<br>Yoga power that he divided himself in twain, one of which continued to<br>give heat, and the other appeared before Kunti. And he addressed Kunti in<br>words that were exceedingly sweet, saying, 'O gentle maiden, over-powered<br>by the mantras, I come hither obedient to thee. Subject as I am to thy<br>power, what shall I do, O queen? Tell me, for I shall do whatever thou<br>mayst command? Hearing these words of the deity, Kunti said, 'O<br>worshipful one, go thou back to the place thou hast come from! I invoked<br>thee from curiosity alone. Pardon me, O worshipful one!' Surya then said,<br>'O damsel of slender waist, I will, even as thou hast said, return to the<br>place I have come from! Having called a celestial, it is not, however,<br>proper to send him away in vain. Thy intention, O blessed one, it is to<br>have from Surya a son furnished with a coat of mail and ear-rings, and<br>who in point of prowess would be beyond compare in this world! Do thou,<br>therefore, O damsel of elephantine gait, surrender thy person to me! Thou<br>shall then have, O lady, a son after thy wish! O gentle girl, O thou of<br>sweet smiles, I will go back after having known thee! If thou do not<br>gratify me to-day by obeying my word, I shall in anger curse thee, thy<br>father and that Brahmana also. For thy fault, I will surely consume them<br>all, and I shall inflict condign punishment on that foolish father of<br>thine that knoweth not this transgression of thine and on that Brahmana<br>who hath bestowed the mantras on thee without knowing thy disposition and<br>character! Yonder are all the celestials in heaven, with Purandara at<br>their head, who are looking at me with derisive smiles at my being<br>deceived by thee, O lady! Look at those celestials, for thou art now<br>possessed of celestial sight! Before this I have endued thee with<br>celestial vision, in consequence of which thou couldst see me!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thereupon the princess beheld the celestials<br>standing in the firmament, each in his proper sphere[107], even as she<br>saw before her that highly resplendent deity furnished with rays, viz.,<br>Surya himself. And beholding them all, the girl became frightened and her<br>face was suffused with blushes of shame. And then she addressed Surya,<br>saying, 'O lord of rays, go thou back to thy own region. On account of my<br>maidenhood, this outrage of thine is fraught with woe to me! It is only<br>one's father, mother, and other superiors, that are capable of giving<br>away their daughter's body. Virtue I shall never sacrifice, seeing that<br>in this world the keeping of their persons inviolate is deemed as the<br>highest duty of women, and is held in high regard! O thou possessed of<br>wealth of splendour, it is only to test the power of my mantras that I<br>have, from mere childishness, summoned thee. Considering that this hath<br>been done by a girl of tender years, it behoveth thee, O lord, to forgive<br>her!' Then Surya said, 'It is because I consider thee a girl that, O<br>Kunti, I am speaking to thee so mildly. To one that is not so I would not<br>concede this. Do thou, O Kunti, surrender thyself! Thou shalt surely<br>attain happiness thereby. Since, O timid maiden, thou hast invoked me<br>with mantras, it is not proper for me to go away without any purpose<br>being attained, for, if I do so I shall then. O thou of faultless limbs,<br>be the object of laughter in the world, and, O beauteous damsel, a<br>bye-word with all the celestials. Do thou, therefore, yield to me! By<br>that thou shalt obtain a son even like myself, and thou shalt also be<br>much praised in all the world.'"
