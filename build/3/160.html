                            Vaisampayana said, "Hearing various sounds resounding in the caves of the<br>mountain and not seeing Bhimasena, Kunti's son, Ajatasatru and the twin<br>sons of Madri and Dhaumya and Krishna and all the Brahmanas and the<br>friends (of the Pandavas), were filled with anxiety. Thereupon,<br>entrusting Draupadi to the charge of Arshtishena and equipped in their<br>arms, those valiant and mighty charioteers together began to ascend the<br>summit of the mountain. And having reached the summit, as those<br>repressors of foes and mighty bowmen and powerful charioteers they were<br>looking about, saw Bhima and those huge Rakshasas of mighty strength and<br>courage weltering in a state of unconsciousness having been struck down<br>by Bhima. And holding his mace and sword and bow, that mighty-armed one<br>looked like Maghavan, after he had slain the danava hosts. Then on seeing<br>their brother, the Pandavas, who had attained excellent state, embraced<br>him and sat down there. And with those mighty bowmen, that summit looked<br>grand like heaven graced by those foremost of celestials, the highly<br>fortunate Lokapalas. And seeing the abode of Kuvera and the Rakshasas,<br>lying slain on the ground, the king addressed his brother who was seated,<br>saying, 'Either it be through rashness, or through ignorance, thou hast,<br>O Bhima, committed a sinful act. O hero, as thou art leading the life of<br>an anchorite, this slaughter without cause is unlike thee. Acts, it is<br>asserted by those versed in duties, as are calculated to displease a<br>monarch, ought not to be committed. But thou hast, O Bhimasena, committed<br>a deed which will offend even the gods. He that disregarding profit and<br>duty, turneth his thoughts to sin must, O Partha, reap the fruit of his<br>sinful actions. However, if thou seekest my good, never again commit such<br>a deed.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having said this to his brother, Vrikodara the<br>virtuous, the highly energetic and firm-minded son of Kunti, Yudhishthira<br>versed in the particulars of (the science of) profit, ceased, and began<br>to reflect on that matter."<br><br>"On the other hand, the Rakshasas that had survived those slain by Bhima<br>fled in a body towards the abode of Kuvera. And they of exceeding<br>fleetness having speedily reached Vaisravana's abode, began to utter loud<br>cries of distress, being afflicted with the fear of Bhima. And, O king<br>bereft of their weapons and exhausted and with their mail besmeared with<br>gore and with dishevelled hair they spake unto Kuvera, saying. 'O lord,<br>all thy foremost Rakshasas fighting with maces and clubs and swords and<br>lances and barbed darts, have been slain. O lord of treasures, a mortal,<br>trespassing into the mountain, hath, singlehanded, slaughtered all thy<br>Krodhovasa Rakshasas assembled together. And, O lord of wealth, there lie<br>the foremost of the Yakshas and Rakshasas senseless and dead, having been<br>struck down; and we have been let off through his favour. And thy friend,<br>Maniman also hath been slain. All this hath been done by a mortal. Do<br>thou what is proper, after this.' Having heard this, that lord of all the<br>Yaksha hosts waxing wroth, with eyes reddened in anger, exclaimed,<br>'What!' And hearing of Bhima's second (act of) aggression, that lord of<br>treasures, the king of the Yakshas, was filled with wrath, and said.<br>'Yoke' (the horses). Thereat unto a car of the hue of dark clouds, and<br>high as a mountain summit, they yoked steeds having golden garments. And<br>on being yoked unto the car, those excellent horses of his, graced with<br>every noble quality and furnished with the ten auspicious curls of hair<br>and having energy and strength, and adorned with various gems and looking<br>splendid, as if desirous of speeding like the wind, began to neigh at<br>each other the neighing emitted at (the hour of) victory. And that divine<br>and effulgent king of the Yakshas set out, being eulogised by the<br>celestials and Gandharvas. And a thousand foremost Yakshas of reddened<br>eyes and golden lustre and having huge bodies, and gifted with great<br>strength, equipped with weapons and girding on their swords, followed<br>that high-souled lord of treasures. And coursing through the firmament<br>they (the steeds) arrived at the Gandhamadana, as if drawing forward the<br>sky with their fleetness. And with their down standing erect, the<br>Pandavas saw that large assemblage of horses maintained by the lord of<br>wealth and also the highsouled and graceful Kuvera himself surrounded by<br>the Yaksha hosts. And seeing those mighty charioteers the son of Pandu,<br>possessed of great strength, equipped with bows and swords, Kuvera also<br>was delighted; and he was pleased at heart, keeping in view the task of<br>the celestials. And like unto birds, they, (the Yakshas) gifted with<br>extreme celerity, alighted on the summit of the mountain and stood before<br>them (the Pandavas), with the lord of treasures at their head. Then, O<br>Bharata, seeing him pleased with the Pandavas, the Yakshas and the<br>Gandharvas stood there, free from agitation. Then thinking themselves as<br>having transgressed, those high-souled and mighty charioteers, the<br>Pandavas, having bowed down unto that lord, the giver of wealth stood<br>surrounding the lord of treasures with joined hands. And the lord of<br>treasures sat on that excellent seat, the elegant Pushpaka, constructed<br>by Viswakarma, painted with diverse colours. And thousands of Yakshas and<br>Rakshasas, some having huge frames and some ears resembling pegs, and<br>hundreds of Gandharvas and hosts of Apsaras sat in the presence of that<br>one seated, even as the celestials sit surrounding him of a hundred<br>sacrifices and wearing a beautiful golden garland on his head and holding<br>in his hands his noose and sword and bow, Bhima stood, gazing at the lord<br>of wealth. And Bhimasena did not feel depress either on having been<br>wounded by the Rakshasas, or even in that plight seeing Kuvera arrive.<br><br>"And that one going about on the shoulders of men, on seeing Bhima stand<br>desirous of fighting with sharpened shafts, said unto Dharma's son, 'O<br>Partha, all the creatures know thee as engaged in their good. Do thou.<br>therefore, with thy brothers fearlessly dwell on this summit of the<br>mountain. And, O Pandava, be thou not angry with Bhima. These Yakshas and<br>Rakshasas had already been slain by Destiny: thy brother hath been the<br>instrument merely. And it is not necessary to feel shame for the act of<br>impudence that hath been committed. This destruction of the Rakshasas had<br>been foreseen by the gods. I entertain no anger towards Bhimasena.<br>Rather, O foremost of the Bharata a race, I am pleased with him;<br>nay,&#8212;even before coming here, I had been gratified with this deed of<br>Bhima.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Having spoken thus unto the king, (Kuvera) said unto<br>Bhimasena, 'O child, O best of the Kurus, I do not mind this, O Bhima, as<br>in order to please Krishna, thou hast, disregarding the gods and me also,<br>committed this rash act, namely, the destruction of the Yakshas and the<br>Rakshasas, depending on the strength of thy arms, I am well-pleased with<br>thee. O Vrikodara, to-day I have been freed from a terrible curse. For<br>some offence, that great Rishi, Agastya, had cursed me in anger. Thou<br>hast delivered me by this act (of thine). O Pandu's son, my disgrace had<br>ere this been fated. No offence, therefore, in any way, attaches unto<br>thee, O Pandava.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O divine one, why wast thou cursed by the<br>high-souled Agastya? O god, I am curious to hear about the occasion of<br>that imprecation. I wonder that at that very moment, thou together with<br>thy forces and attendants wast not consumed by the ire of that<br>intelligent one.'<br><br>"Thereupon the lord of treasures said, 'At Kusasthali, O king, once there<br>was held a conclave of the gods. And surrounded by grimvisaged Yakshas,<br>numbering three hundred maha-padmas, carrying various weapons, I was<br>going to that place. And on the way, I saw that foremost of sages,<br>Agastya, engaged in the practice of severe austerities on the bank of the<br>Yamuna, abounding in various birds and graced with blossoming trees. And,<br>O king, immediately on seeing that mass of energy, flaming and brilliant<br>as fire, seated with upraised arms, facing the sun, my friend, the<br>graceful lord of the Rakshasas, Maniman, from stupidity, foolishness,<br>hauteur and ignorance discharged his excrement on the crown of that<br>Maharshi. Thereupon, as if burning all the cardinal points by his wrath,<br>he said unto me, 'Since, O lord of treasures, in thy very presence,<br>disregarding me, this thy friend hath thus affronted me, he, together<br>with thy forces, shall meet with destruction at the hands of a mortal.<br>And, O wicked-minded one, thou also, being distressed on account of thy<br>fallen soldiers, shalt be freed from thy sin, on beholding that mortal.<br>But if they follow thy behests, their (the soldier's) powerful sons shall<br>not incur by this dreadful curse. This curse I received formerly from<br>that foremost of Rishis. Now, O mighty king, have I been delivered by thy<br>brother Bhima.'"
