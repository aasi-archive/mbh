                            Vaisampayana said, "King Duryodhana then moving from forest to forest, at<br>last approached the cattle-stations, and encamped his troops. And his<br>attendants, selecting a well-known and delightful spot that abounded in<br>water and trees and that possessed every convenience constructed an abode<br>for him. And near enough to the royal residence they also erected<br>separate abodes for Kama and Sakuni and the brothers of the king. And the<br>king beheld his cattle by hundreds and thousands and examining their<br>limbs and marks supervised their tale. And he caused the calves to be<br>marked and took note of those that required to be tamed. And he also<br>counted those kine whose calves had not yet been weaned. And completing<br>the task of tale by marking and counting every calf that was three years<br>old, the Kuru prince, surrounded by the cowherds, began to sport and<br>wander cheerfully. And the citizens also and the soldiers by thousands<br>began to sport, as best pleased them, in those woods, like the<br>celestials. And the herdsmen, well skilled in singing and dancing and<br>instrumental music, and virgins decked in ornaments, began to minister to<br>the pleasures of Dhritarashtra's son. And the king surrounded by the<br>ladies of the royal household began cheerfully to distribute wealth and<br>food and drinks of various kinds amongst those that sought to please him,<br>according to their desires.<br><br>"And the king, attended by all his followers, began also to slay hyenas<br>and buffaloes and deer and gayals and bears and boars all around. And the<br>king, piercing by his shafts those animals by thousands in deep forest,<br>caused the deer to be caught in the more delightful parts of the woods.<br>Drinking milk and enjoying, O Bharata, various other delicious articles<br>and beholding, as he proceeded, many delightful forests and woods<br>swarming with bees inebriate with floral honey and resounding with the<br>notes of the peacock, the king at last reached the sacred lake of<br>Dwaitavana. And the spot which the king reached swarmed with bees<br>inebriate with floral honey, and echoed with the mellifluous notes of the<br>blue-throated jay and was shaded by Saptacchadas and punnagas and<br>Vakulas. And the king graced with high prosperity proceeded thither like<br>the thunder-wielding chief of the celestials himself. And, O thou best of<br>the Kuru race, King Yudhishthira the just, endued with high intelligence,<br>was then, O monarch, residing in the vicinity of that lake at will and<br>celebrating with his wedded wife, the daughter of Drupada, the diurnal<br>sacrifice called Rajarshi, according to the ordinance sanctioned for the<br>celestials and persons living in the wilderness. And, O monarch, having<br>reached that spot, Duryodhana commanded his men by thousands, saying,<br>'Let pleasure-houses be constructed soon.' Thus commanded, those doers of<br>the king's behests replying to the Kruru chief with the words, 'So be<br>it,' went towards the banks of the lake for constructing pleasure-houses.<br>And as the picked soldiers of Dhritarashtra's son, having reached the<br>region of the lake, were about to enter the gates of the wood, a number<br>of Gandharvas appeared and forbade them to enter. For, O monarch, the<br>king of the Gandharvas accompanied by his followers, had come thither<br>beforehand, from the abode of Kuvera. And the king of the Gandharvas had<br>also been accompanied by the several tribes of Apsaras, as also by the<br>sons of the celestials And intent upon sport, he had come to that place<br>for merriment, and occupying it, had closed it against all comers. And<br>the attendants of the (Kuru) king, finding the lake closed by the king of<br>the Gandharvas, went back, O monarch, to where the royal Duryodhana was.<br>And Duryodhana having heard these words, despatched a number of his<br>warriors difficult of being subjugated in battle, commanding them to<br>drive away the Gandharvas. And those warriors who formed the vanguard of<br>the Kuru army, hearing these words of the king, went back to the lake of<br>Dwaitavana and addressing the Gandharvas, said, 'The mighty king<br>Duryodhana&#8212;the son of Dhritarashtra&#8212;is coming, hither for sport. Stand<br>ye aside, therefore!' Thus addressed by them, O king, the Gandharvas<br>laughed and replied unto those men in these harsh words: 'Your wicked<br>king Duryodhana must be destitute of sense. How else could he have thus<br>commanded us that are dwellers of heaven, as if indeed, we were his<br>servants? Without forethought, ye also are doubtless on the point of<br>death; for senseless idiots as ye are, ye have dared to bring us his<br>message! Return ye soon to where that king of the Kurus is, or else go<br>this very day to the abode of Yama.' Thus addressed by the Gandharvas,<br>the advanced guard of the king's army ran back to the place where the<br>royal son of Dhritarashtra was."
