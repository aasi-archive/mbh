                            "Lomasa said, 'O son of Bharata's race! If mortals breathe their last at<br>this spot, they go to heaven. O king! Thousands upon thousands of men<br>come to this place to die. A blessing was pronounced on this spot by<br>Daksha, when he was engaged in sacrifice here, (in these words), 'Those<br>men that shall die at this spot shall win a place in heaven.' Here is the<br>beautiful and sacred river, Saraswati, full of water: and here, O lord of<br>men, is the spot known as Vinasana, or the place where the Saraswati<br>disappeared. Here is the gate of the kingdom of the Nishadas and it is<br>from hatred for them that the Saraswati entered into the earth in order<br>that the Nishadas might not see her. Here too is the sacred region of<br>Chamashodbheda where the Saraswati once more became visible to them. And<br>here she is joined by other sacred rivers running seawards. O conqueror<br>of foes, here is that sacred spot known by the name of Sindhu&#8212;where<br>Lopamudra accepted the great sage Agastya as her lord and, O thou whose<br>effulgence is like unto that of the sun, here is the sacred tirtha called<br>Prabhasa, the favoured spot of Indra and which removeth all sins. Yonder<br>is visible the region of Vishnupada. And here is the delightful and<br>sacred river, Vipasa. From grief for the death of his sons the great sage<br>Vasistha had thrown himself into this stream, after binding his limbs.<br>And when he rose from the water, lo! he was unfettered. Look, O king with<br>thy brothers at the sacred region of Kasmeera, frequented by holy sages.<br>Here, O scion of Bharata's race, is the spot, where a conference took<br>place between Agni and the sage Kasyapa, and also between Nahusha's son<br>and the sages of the north. And, O great prince, Yonder is the gate of<br>the Manasasarovara. In the midst of this mountain, a gap hath been opened<br>by Rama. And here. O prince of prowess incapable of being baffled, is the<br>well-known region of Vatikhanda, which, although adjacent to the gate of<br>Videha, lieth on the north of it. And O bull among men, there is another<br>very remarkable thing connected with this place,&#8212;namely, that on the<br>waning of every yuga, the god Siva, having the power to assume any shape<br>at will, may be seen with Uma and his followers. In Yonder lake also<br>people desirous of securing welfare to the family, propitiate with<br>sacrifices the holder of the great bow Pinaka, in the month of Chaitra.<br>And persons of devotion having passions under control, performing their<br>ablutions in this lake, become free from sins and, without doubt, attain<br>to the holy regions. Here is the sacred tirtha called Ujjanaka, where the<br>holy sage Vasistha with his wife Arundhati and also the sage Yavakri<br>obtained tranquillity. Yonder is the lake Kausava, where grown the<br>lotuses called Kausesaya, and here also is the sacred hermitage of<br>Rukmini, where she attained peace, after conquering that evil passion,<br>anger. I think, O prince, that thou hast heard something about that man<br>of meditations, Bhrigutunga. There, O king, before thee is that lofty<br>peak. And, O foremost of kings, yonder is Vitasta, the sacred stream that<br>absolveth men from all sins. The water of this stream is extremely cool<br>and limpid, and it is largely used by the great sages. O prince, behold<br>the holy rivers Jala and Upajala, on either side of the Yamuna. By<br>performing a sacrifice here, king Usinara surpassed in greatness Indra<br>himself. And, O descendant of Bharata, desirous of testing Usinara's<br>merit and also of bestowing boons on him, Indra and Agni presented<br>themselves at his sacrificial ground. And Indra assuming the shape of a<br>hawk, and Agni that of a pigeon, came up to that king. And the pigeon in<br>fear of the hawk, fell upon the king's thigh, seeking his protection.'"
