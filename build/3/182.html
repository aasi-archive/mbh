                            Vaisampayana said, "O son of Kuru, they, Yudhishthira and others, having<br>reached the forest of Kamyaka, were, hospitably received by hosts of<br>saints and they lived together with Krishna. And while the sons of Pandu<br>were dwelling in security in that place, many Brahmanas came to wait upon<br>them. And a certain Brahmana said, 'He the beloved friend of Arjuna, of<br>powerful arms and possessed of self control, descendant of Sura, of a<br>lofty intellect, will come, for, O ye foremost of the descendants of<br>Kuru, Hari knows that ye have arrived here. For, Hari has always a<br>longing for your sight and always seeks your welfare. And Markandeya, who<br>lived very many years devoted to great austerities, given to study and<br>penance, will erelong come and meet you.' And the very moment that he was<br>uttering these words, there was beheld Krishna, coming thitherward upon a<br>car unto which were yoked the horses Saivya and Sugriva,&#8212;he the best of<br>those that ride on cars, accompanied by Satyabhama, is like Indra by<br>Sachi, the daughter of Pulaman. And the son of Devaki came, desirous to<br>see those most righteous of the descendants of Kuru. And the sagacious<br>Krishna, having alighted from the car, prostrated himself, with pleasure<br>in his heart, before the virtuous king, in the prescribed way, and also<br>before Bhima, that foremost of powerful men. And he paid his respects to<br>Dhaumya, while the twin brothers prostrated themselves to him. And he<br>embraced Arjuna of the curly hair; and spoke words of solace to the<br>daughter of Drupada. And the descendant of the chief of the Dasaraha<br>tribe, that chastiser of foes, when he saw the beloved Arjuna come near<br>him, having seen him after a length of time, clasped him again and again.<br>And so too Satyabhama also, the beloved consort of Krishna, embraced the<br>daughter of Drupada, the beloved wife of the sons of Pandu. Then these<br>sons of Pandu, accompanied by their wife and priests, paid their respects<br>to Krishna, whose eyes resembled the white lotus and surrounded him on<br>all sides. And Krishna, when united with Arjuna, the son of Pritha, the<br>winner of riches and the terror of the demons assumed a beauty comparable<br>to that of Siva, the magnanimous lord of all created beings, when he, the<br>mighty lord, is united with Kartikeya (his son). And Arjuna, who bore a<br>circlet of crowns on his head, gave an account of what had happened to<br>him in the forest to Krishna, the elder brother of Gada. And Arjuna<br>asked, saying, 'How is Subhadra, and her son Abhimanyu?' And Krishna, the<br>slayer of Madhu, having paid his respects in the prescribed form to the<br>son of Pritha, and to the priest, and seating himself with them there,<br>spoke to king Yudhishthira, in words of praise. And he said, 'O king,<br>Virtue is preferable to the winning of kingdoms; it is, in fact, practice<br>of austerities! By you who have obeyed with truth and candour what your<br>duty prescribed, have been won both this world and that to come! First<br>you have studied, while performing religious duties; having acquired in a<br>suitable way the whole science of arms, having won wealth by pursuing the<br>methods prescribed for the military caste, you have celebrated all the<br>time-honoured sacrificial rites. You take no delight in sensual<br>pleasures; you do not act, O lord of men, from motives of enjoyment, nor<br>do you swerve from virtue from greed of riches; it is for this, you have<br>been named the Virtuous King, O son of Pritha! Having won kingdoms and<br>riches and means of enjoyment, your best delight has been charity and<br>truth and practice of austerities, O King, and faith and meditation and<br>forbearance and patience! When the population of Kuru-jangala beheld<br>Krishna outraged in the assembly hall, who but yourself could brook that<br>conduct, O Pandu's son, which was so repugnant both to virtue and usage?<br>No doubt, you will, before long, rule over men in a praiseworthy way, all<br>your desires being fulfilled. Here are we prepared to chastise the Kurus,<br>as soon as the stipulation made by you is fully performed! And Krishna,<br>the foremost of the Dasarha tribe, then said to Dhaumya and Bhima and<br>Yudhishthira, and the twins and Krishna, 'How fortunate that by your<br>blessing Arjuna the bearer of the coronet, has arrived after having<br>acquired the science of arms!" And Krishna, the leader of the Dasarha<br>tribe, accompanied by friends, likewise spoke to Krishna, the daughter of<br>Yajnasena, saying, 'How fortunate that you are united, safe and secure,<br>with Arjuna, the winner of riches!' And Krishna also said, 'O Krishna, O<br>daughter of Yajnasena, those sons of yours, are devoted to the study of<br>the science of arms, are well-behaved and conduct themselves on the<br>pattern, O Krishna, of their righteous friends. Your father and your<br>uterine brothers proffer them a kingdom and territories; but the boys<br>find no joy in the house of Drupada, or in that of their maternal uncles.<br>Safely proceeding to the land of the Anartas, they take the greatest<br>delight in the study of the science of arms. Your sons enter the town of<br>the Vrishnis and take an immediate liking to the people there. And as you<br>would direct them to conduct themselves, or as the respected Kunti would<br>do, so does Subhadra direct them in a watchful way. Perhaps, she is still<br>more careful of them. And, O Krishna, as Rukmini's son is the preceptor<br>of Aniruddha, of Abhimanyu, of Sunitha, and of Bhanu; so he is the<br>preceptor and the refuge of your sons also! And a good preceptor, would<br>unceasingly give them lessons in the wielding of maces and swords and<br>bucklers, in missiles and in the arts of driving cars and of riding<br>horses, being valiant. And he, the son of Rukmini, having bestowed a very<br>good training upon them, and having taught them the art of using various<br>weapons in a proper way, takes satisfaction at the valorous deeds of your<br>sons, and of Abhimanyu. O daughter of Drupada! And when your son goes<br>out, in pursuit of (out-door) sports, each one of them is followed<br>thither by cars and horses and vehicles and elephants.' And Krishna said<br>to the virtuous king, Yudhishthira, The fighting men of the Dasarha<br>tribe, and the Kukuras, and the Andhakas&#8212;let these, O king, place<br>themselves at thy command&#8212;let them perform what thou desirest them. O<br>lord of men, let the army of the tribe of Madhus, (resistless) like the<br>wind, with their bows and led by Balarama whose weapon is the plough&#8212;let<br>that army, equipped (for war), consisting of horsemen and foot soldiers<br>and horses and cars and elephants, prepare to do your bidding. O son of<br>Pandu! Drive Duryodhana, the son of Dhritarashtra, the vilest of sinful<br>men, together with his followers and his hosts of friends to the path<br>betaken by the lord of Saubha, the son of the Earth! You, O ruler of men,<br>are welcome to stick to that stipulation which was made in the<br>assembly-hall&#8212;but let the city of Hastina be made ready for you, when<br>the hostile force has been slain by the soldiers of the Dasarha tribe!<br>Having roamed at your pleasure in all those places where you may desire<br>to go, having got rid of your grief and freed from all your sins&#8212;you<br>will reach the city of Hastina&#8212;the well-known city situated in the midst<br>of a fine territory!&#8212;Then the magnanimous king having been acquainted<br>with the view, thus clearly set forth by Krishna that best of men, and,<br>having applauded the same, and having deliberated, thus spoke with joined<br>palms unto Kesava, 'O Kesava, no doubt, thou art the refuge of the sons<br>of Pandu; for the sons of Pandu have their protector in thee! When the<br>time will come, there is no doubt that thou wilt do all the work just<br>mentioned by thee; and even more than the same! As promised by us, we<br>have spent all the twelve years in lonely forests. O Kesava, having in<br>the prescribed way completed the period for living unrecognised, the sons<br>of Pandu will take refuge in thee. This should be the intention of those<br>that associate with thee, O Krishna! The sons of Pandu swerve not from<br>the path of truth, for the sons of Pritha with their charity and their<br>piety with their people and their wives and with their relations have<br>their protector in thee!"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, 'O descendant of Bharata, while Krishna, the<br>descendant of the Vrishnis and the virtuous king, were thus talking,<br>there appeared then the saint Markandeya, grown grey in the practise of<br>penances. And he had seen many thousand years of life, was of a pious<br>soul, and devoted to great austerities. Signs of old age he had none; and<br>deathless he was, and endued with beauty and generous and many good<br>qualities. And he looked like one only twenty-five years old. And when<br>the aged saint, who had seen many thousand years of life, came, all the<br>Brahamanas paid their respects to him and so did Krishna together with<br>Pandu's son. And when that wisest saint, thus honoured, took his seat in<br>a friendly way, Krishna addressed him, in accordance with the views of<br>the Brahmanas and of Pandu's sons, thus,&#8212;<br><br>"The sons of Pandu, and the Brahmanas assembled here, and the daughter of<br>Drupada, and Satyabhama, likewise myself, are all anxious to hear your<br>most excellent words, O Markandeya! Propound to us the holy stories of<br>events of bygone times, and the eternal rules of righteous conduct by<br>which are guided kings and women and saints!"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "When they had all taken their seats, Narada<br>also, the divine saint, of purified soul, came on a visit to Pandu's<br>sons. Him also, then, of great soul, all those foremost men of superior<br>intellect, honoured in the prescribed form, by offering water to wash his<br>feet, and the well-known oblation called the Arghya. Then the godlike<br>saint, Narada, learning that they were about to hear the speech of<br>Markandeya, expressed his assent to the arrangement. And he, the<br>deathless, knowing what would be opportune, said smilingly, 'O saint of<br>the Brahmana caste, speak what you were about to say unto the sons of<br>Pandu!' Thus addressed, Markandeya, devoted to great austerities,<br>replied, 'Wait a moment. A great deal will be narrated.' Thus addressed,<br>the sons of Pandu, together with those twice-born ones, waited a moment,<br>looking at that great saint, (bright) as the mid-day sun."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Pandu's son, the king of the Kuru tribe, having<br>observed that the great saint as willing to speak, questioned him with a<br>view to suggesting topics to speak upon, saying, 'You who are ancient (in<br>years), know the deeds of gods and demons, and illustrious saints, and of<br>all the royal ones. We consider you as worthy of being worshipped and<br>honoured; and we have long yearned after your company. And here is this<br>son of Devaki, Krishna, who has come to us on a visit. Verily, when I<br>look at myself, fallen away from happiness, and when I contemplate the<br>sons of Dhritarashtra, of evil life, flourishing in every way, the idea<br>arises in me that it is man who does all acts, good or bad, and that it<br>is he that enjoys the fruit the acts bring forth. How then is god the<br>agent? And, O best of those that are proficient in the knowledge of God,<br>how is it that men's actions follow them? Is it in this world? Or is it<br>in some subsequent existence? And, O best of righteous men among the<br>twice-born, in what way is an embodied animated being joined by his good<br>and evil deeds that seek him out? Is it after death? Or is it in this<br>world? And, O descendant of Bhrigu, is what we experience in this world<br>the result of the acts of this very life? Or will the acts of this life<br>bear fruit in the world to come? And where do the actions of an animated<br>being who is dead find their resting place?"<br><br>"Markandeya said, 'O best of those that can speak, this question befits<br>thee, and is just what it should be? Thou knowest all that there is to<br>know. But thou art asking this question, simply for the sake of form.<br>Here I shall answer thee: listen to me with an attentive mind, as to how<br>in this world and in that to come, a man experienceth happiness and<br>misery. The lord of born beings, himself sprung first of all, created,<br>for all embodied beings, bodies which were stainless, pure, and obedient<br>to virtuous impulses, O wisest of the descendants of Kuru! The ancient<br>men had all their desires fulfilled, were given to praiseworthy courses<br>of life, were speakers of truth, godly and pure. All were equal to the<br>gods, could ascend to the sky at their pleasure, and could come back<br>again; and all went about at their pleasure. And they had their death and<br>their life also under their own control; and they had few sufferings; had<br>no fear; and had their wishes fulfilled; and they were free from trouble;<br>could visit the gods and the magnanimous saints; knew by heart all<br>righteous rules; were self-controlled and free from envy. And they lived<br>many thousand years; and had many thousand sons. Then in course of time<br>they came to be restricted to walking solely on the surface of the earth,<br>overpowered by lust and wrath, dependent for subsistence upon falsehood<br>and trick, overwhelmed by greed and senselessness. Then those wicked men,<br>when disembodied, on account of their unrighteous and unblessed deeds,<br>went to hell in a crooked way. Again and again, they were grilled, and,<br>again and again they began to drag their miserable existence in this<br>wonderful world. And their desires were unfulfilled, the objects<br>unaccomplished, and their knowledge became unavailing. And their senses<br>were paralysed and they became apprehensive of everything and the cause<br>of other people's sufferings. And they were generally marked by wicked<br>deeds, and born in low families; they became wicked and afflicted with<br>diseases, and the terror of others. And they became short-lived and<br>sinful and they reaped the fruit of their terrible deeds. And coveting<br>everything, they became godless and indifferent in mind, O son of Kunti!<br>The destiny of every creature after death is determined by his acts in<br>this world. Thou hast asked me where this treasure of acts of the sage<br>and the ignorant remain, and where they enjoy the fruit of their good and<br>evil deeds! Do thou listen to the regulations on this subject! Man with<br>his subtle original body created by God lays up a great store of virtue<br>and vice. After death he quits his frail (outer) body and is immediately<br>born again in another order of beings. He never remains non-existent for<br>a single moment. In his new life his actions follow him invariably as<br>shadow and, fructifying, makes his destiny happy or miserable. The wise<br>man, by his spiritual insight, knows all creatures to be bound to an<br>immutable destiny by the destroyer and incapable of resisting the<br>fruition of his actions in good or evil fortune. This, O Yudhishthira, is<br>the doom of all creatures steeped in spiritual ignorance. Do thou now<br>hear of the perfect way attained by men of high spiritual perception!<br>Such men are of high ascetic virtue and are versed in all profane and<br>holy writ, diligent in performing their religious obligations and devoted<br>to truth. And they pay due homage to their preceptors and superiors and<br>practise Yoga, are forgiving, continent and energetic and pious and are<br>generally endowed with every virtue. By the conquest of the passions,<br>they are subdued in mind; by practising yoga they become free from<br>disease, fear and sorrow; they are not troubled (in mind). In course of<br>birth, mature or immature, or while ensconced in the womb, in every<br>condition, they with spiritual eyes recognize the relation of their soul<br>to the supreme Spirit. Those great-minded Rishis of positive and<br>intuitive knowledge passing through this arena of actions, return again<br>to the abode of the celestials. Men, O king, attain what they have in<br>consequence of the grace of the gods of Destiny or of their own actions.<br>Do thou not think otherwise. O Yudhishthira, I regard that as the highest<br>good which is regarded so in this world. Some attain happiness in this<br>world, but not in the next; others do so in the next, but not in this.<br>Some, again, attain happiness in this as well as in the next world; and<br>others neither here nor in the next world. Those that have immense<br>wealth, shine every day with well-decorated persons. O slayer of mighty<br>foes, being addicted to carnal pleasures, they enjoy happiness only in<br>this world, but not in the next. But those who are engaged in spiritual<br>meditations and the study of the Vedas, who are diligent in asceticism,<br>and who impair the vigour of their bodies by performing their duties, who<br>have subdued their passions, and who refrain from killing any animated<br>being, those men, O slayer of thy enemies, attain happiness in the next<br>world, but not in this! Those who first live a pious life, and virtuously<br>acquire wealth in due time and then marry and perform sacrifices, attain<br>bliss both in this and the next world. Those foolish men again who do not<br>acquire knowledge, nor are engaged in asceticism or charity or increasing<br>their species; or in encompassing the pleasures and enjoyments of this<br>world, attain bliss neither in this nor in the next world. But all of you<br>are proficient in knowledge and possessed of great power and strength and<br>celestial vigour. For the extermination (of the wicked) and for serving<br>the purposes of the gods, ye have come from the other world and have<br>taken your birth in this! Ye, who are so valiant, and engaged in<br>asceticism, self-restraining exercises, and religious ordinances, and<br>fond of exertion, after having performed great deeds and gratified the<br>gods and Rishis and the Pitris, ye will at last in due course attain by<br>your own acts the supreme region&#8212;the abode of all virtuous men! O<br>ornament of Kuru's race, may no doubts cross thy mind on account of these<br>thy sufferings, for this affliction is for thy good!"
