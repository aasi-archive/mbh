                            Janamejaya said, "While the high-souled Pandavas were living in those<br>woods, delighted with the pleasant conversation they held with the Munis,<br>and engaged in distributing the food they obtained from the sun, with<br>various kinds of venison to Brahmanas and others that came to them for<br>edibles till the hour of Krishna's meal, how, O great Muni, did<br>Duryodhana and the other wicked and sinful sons of Dhritarashtra, guided<br>by the counsels of Dussasana, Karna and Sakuni, deal with them? I ask<br>thee this. Do thou, worshipful Sir, enlighten me."<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "When, O great king, Duryodhana heard that the<br>Pandavas were living as happily in the woods as in a city, he longed,<br>with the artful Karna, Dussasana and others, to do them harm. And while<br>those evil-minded persons were employed in concerting various wicked<br>designs, the virtuous and celebrated ascetic Durvasa, following the bent<br>of his own will, arrived at the city of the Kurus with ten thousand<br>disciples. And seeing the irascible ascetic arrived, Duryodhana and his<br>brothers welcomed him with great humility, self-abasement and gentleness.<br>And himself attending on the Rishi as a menial, the prince gave him a<br>right worshipful reception. And the illustrious Muni stayed there for a<br>few days, while king Duryodhana, watchful of his imprecations, attended<br>on him diligently by day and night. And sometimes the Muni would say, 'I<br>am hungry, O king, give me some food quickly.' And sometimes he would go<br>out for a bath and, returning at a late hour, would say, 'I shall not eat<br>anything today as I have no appetite,' and so saying would disappear from<br>his sight. And sometimes, coming all on a sudden, he would say, 'Feed us<br>quickly.' And at other times, bent on some mischief, he would awake at<br>midnight and having caused his meals to be prepared as before, would carp<br>at them and not partake of them at all. And trying the prince in this way<br>for a while, when the Muni found that the king Duryodhana was neither<br>angered, nor annoyed, he became graciously inclined towards him. And<br>then, O Bharata, the intractable Durvasa said unto him, 'I have power to<br>grant thee boons. Thou mayst ask of me whatever lies nearest to thy<br>heart. May good fortune be thine. Pleased as I am with thee, thou mayst<br>obtain from me anything that is not opposed to religion and morals.'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Hearing these words of the great ascetic,<br>Suyodhana felt himself to be inspired with new life. Indeed, it had been<br>agreed upon between himself and Karna and Dussasana as to what the boon<br>should be that he would ask of the Muni if the latter were pleased with<br>his reception. And the evil-minded king, bethinking himself of what had<br>previously been decided, joyfully solicited the following favour, saying,<br>'The great king Yudhishthira is the eldest and the best of our race. That<br>pious man is now living in the forest with his brothers. Do thou,<br>therefore, once become the guest of that illustrious one even as, O<br>Brahmana, thou hast with thy disciples been mine for some time. If thou<br>art minded to do me a favour, do thou go unto him at a time when that<br>delicate and excellent lady, the celebrated princess of Panchala, after<br>having regaled with food the Brahmanas, her husbands and herself, may lie<br>down to rest.' The Rishi replied, 'Even so shall I act for thy<br>satisfaction.' And having said this to Suyodhana, that great Brahmana,<br>Durvasa, went away in the very same state in which he had come. And<br>Suyodhana regarded himself to have attained all the objects of his<br>desire. And holding Karna by the hand he expressed great satisfaction.<br>And Karna, too, joyfully addressed the king in the company of his<br>brothers, saying, 'By a piece of singular good luck, thou hast fared well<br>and attained the objects of thy desire. And by good luck it is that thy<br>enemies have been immersed in a sea of dangers that is difficult to<br>cross. The sons of Pandu are now exposed to the fire of Durvasa's wrath.<br>Through their own fault they have fallen into an abyss of darkness.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "O king, expressing their satisfaction in this<br>strain, Duryodhana and others, bent on evil machinations, returned<br>merrily to their respective homes."
