                            "Markandeya said, 'Afflicted with grief at the abduction of Sita, Rama<br>had not to go much further before he came upon Pampa&#8212;that lake which<br>abounded with lotuses of various kinds. And fanned by the cool, delicious<br>and fragrant breezes in those woods, Rama suddenly remembered his dear<br>spouse. And, O mighty monarch, thinking of that dear wife of his, and<br>afflicted at the thought of his separation from her, Rama gave way to<br>lamentations. The son of Sumitra then addressed him saying, 'O thou that<br>givest proper respect to those that deserve it, despondency such as this<br>should not be suffered to approach thee, like illness that can never<br>touch an old man leading a regular life! Thou hast obtained information<br>of Ravana and of the princess of Videha! Liberate her now with exertion<br>and intelligence! Let us now approach Sugriva, that foremost of monkeys,<br>who is even now on the mountain top! Console thyself, when I, thy<br>disciple and slave and ally, am near!' And addressed by Lakshmana in<br>these and other words of the same import, Rama regained his own nature<br>and attended to the business before him. And bathing in the waters of<br>Pampa and offering oblations therewith unto their ancestors, both those<br>heroic brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, set out (for Rishyamuka). And<br>arriving at Rishyamuka which abounded with fruits and roots and trees,<br>those heroes beheld five monkeys on the top of the mountain-peak. And<br>seeing them approach, Sugriva sent his counsellor the intelligent<br>Hanuman, huge as the Himavat-mountains, to receive them. And the<br>brothers, having first exchanged words with Hanuman, approached Sugriva.<br>And then, O king, Rama made friends with Sugriva. And when Rama informed<br>Sugriva of the object he had in view, Sugriva showed him the piece of<br>cloth that Sita had dropped among the monkeys, while being carried away<br>by Ravana. And having obtained from him those credentials, Rama himself<br>installed Sugriva&#8212;that foremost of monkeys&#8212;in sovereignty of all the<br>monkeys of Earth. And Rama also pledged himself to slay Vali in battle.<br>And having come to that understanding and placing the fullest confidence<br>in each other, they all repaired to Kiskindhya, desirous of battle (with<br>Vali). And arriving at Kiskindhya, Sugriva sent forth a loud roar deep as<br>that of a cataract. Unable to bear that challenge, Vali was for coming<br>out (but his wife) Tara stood in way, saying, 'Himself endued with great<br>strength, the way in which Sugriva is roaring, showeth, I ween, that he<br>hath found assistance! It behoveth thee not, therefore, to go out! Thus<br>addressed by her, that king of the monkeys, the eloquent Vali, decked in<br>a golden garland replied unto Tara of face beautiful as the moon, saying,<br>'Thou understandest the voice of every creature. Tell me after reflection<br>whose help it is that this brother in name only of mine hath obtained!'<br>Thus addressed by him Tara endued with wisdom and possessed of the<br>effulgence of the moon, answered her lord after a moment's reflection,<br>saying, 'Listen, O monarch of the monkeys! That foremost of bowmen,<br>endued with great might, Rama the son of Dasaratha, whose spouse hath<br>been ravished, hath made an alliance offensive and defensive with<br>Sugriva! And his brother the intelligent Lakshmana also of mighty arms,<br>the unvanquished son of Sumitra, standeth beside him for the success of<br>Sugriva's object. And Mainda and Dwivida, and Hanuman the son of Pavana,<br>and Jamvuman, the king of the bears, are beside Sugriva as his<br>counsellors. All these illustrious ones are endued with great strength<br>and intelligence. And these all, depending upon the might and energy of<br>Rama, are prepared for thy destruction!' Hearing these words of hers that<br>were for his benefit, the king of the monkeys disregarded them<br>altogether. And filled with jealousy, he also suspected her to have set<br>her heart on Sugriva! And addressing Tara in harsh words, he went out of<br>his cave and coming before Sugriva who was staying by the side of the<br>mountains of Malyavat, he spoke unto him thus, 'Frequently vanquished<br>before by me, fond as thou art of life, thou art allowed by me to escape<br>with life owing to thy relationship with me! What hath made thee wish for<br>death so soon?' Thus addressed by Vali, Sugriva, that slayer of foes, as<br>if addressing Rama himself for informing him of what had happened,<br>replied unto his brother in these words of grave import, 'O king, robbed<br>by thee of my wife and my kingdom also, what need have I of life? Know<br>that it is for this that I have come!' Then addressing each other in<br>these and other words of the same import, Vali and Sugriva rushed to the<br>encounter, fighting with Sala and Tala trees and stones. And they struck<br>each other down on the earth. And leaping high into the air, they struck<br>each other with their fists. And mangled by each other's nail and teeth,<br>both of them were covered with blood. And the two heroes shone on that<br>account like a pair of blossoming Kinshukas. And as they fought with each<br>other, no difference (in aspect) could be observed so as to distinguish<br>them. Then Hanuman placed on Sugriva's neck a garland of flowers. And<br>that hero thereupon shone with that garland on his neck, like the<br>beautiful and huge peak of Malya with its cloudy belt. And Rama,<br>recognising Sugriva by that sign, then drew his foremost of huge bows,<br>aiming at Vali as his mark. And the twang of Rama's bow resembled the<br>roar of an engine. And Vali, pierced in the heart by that arrow, trembled<br>in fear. And Vali, his heart having been pierced through, began to vomit<br>forth blood. And he then beheld standing before him Rama with Sumatra's<br>son by his side. And reproving that descendant of Kakutstha's race, Vali<br>fell down on the ground and became senseless. And Tara then beheld that<br>lord of hers possessed of the effulgence of the Moon, lying prostrate on<br>the bare earth. And after Vali had been thus slain, Sugriva regained<br>possession of Kishkindhya, and along with it, of the widowed Tara also of<br>face beautiful as the moon. And the intelligent Rama also dwelt on the<br>beautiful breast of the Malyavat hill for four months, duly worshipped by<br>Sugriva all the while.<br><br>"Meanwhile Ravana excited by lust, having reached his city of Lanka,<br>placed Sita in an abode, resembling Nandana itself, within a forest of<br>Asokas, that looked like an asylum of ascetics. And the large-eyed Sita<br>passed her days there in distress, living on fruits and roots, practising<br>ascetic austerities with fasts, attired in ascetic garb, and waning thin<br>day by day, thinking of her absent lord. And the king of the Rakshasas<br>appointed many Rakshasa women armed with bearded darts and swords and<br>lances and battle-axes and maces and flaming brands, for guarding her.<br>And some of these had two eyes, and some three. And some had eyes on<br>their foreheads. And some had long tongues and some had none. And some<br>had three breasts and some had only one leg. And some had three matted<br>braids on their heads, and some had only one eye. And these, and others<br>of blazing eyes and hair stiff as the camel's, stood beside Sita<br>surrounding her day and night most watchfully. And those Pisacha women of<br>frightful voice and terrible aspect always addressed that large-eyed lady<br>in the harshest tones. And they said, 'Let us eat her up, let us mangle<br>her, let us tear her into pieces, her, that is, that dwelleth here<br>disregarding our lord!' And filled with grief at the separation from her<br>lord, Sita drew a deep sigh and answered those Rakshasa women, saying,<br>'Reverend ladies, eat me up without delay! I have no desire to live<br>without that husband of mine, of eyes like lotus-leaves and locks wavy,<br>and blue in hue! Truly I will, without food and without the least love of<br>life, emaciate my limbs, like a she-snake (hibernating) within a Tala<br>tree. Know this for certain that I will never seek the protection of any<br>other person than the descendant of Raghu. And knowing this, do what ye<br>think fit!' And hearing these words of hers, those Rakshasas with<br>dissonant voice went to the king of the Rakshasas, for representing unto<br>him all she had said. And when those Rakshasas had gone away, one of<br>their number known by the name of Trijata, who was virtuous and agreeable<br>in speech, began to console the princess of Videha. And she said,<br>'Listen, O Sita! I will tell thee something! O friend, believe in what I<br>say! O thou of fair hips, cast off thy fears, and listen to what I say.<br>There is an intelligent and old chief of the Rakshasas known by the name<br>of Avindhya. He always seeketh Rama's good and hath told me these words<br>for thy sake! 'Reassuring and cheering her, tell Sita in my name, saying:<br>'Thy husband the mighty Rama is well and is waited upon by Lakshmana. And<br>the blessed descendant of Raghu hath already made friends with Sugriva,<br>the king of the monkeys, and is ready to act for thee! And, O timid lady,<br>entertain thou no fear on account of Ravana, who is censured by the whole<br>world, for, O daughter, thou art safe from him on account of Nalakuvera's<br>curse. Indeed, this wretch had been cursed before for his having violated<br>his daughter-in-law, Rambha. This lustful wretch is not able to violate<br>any woman by force. Thy husband will soon come, protected by Sugriva and<br>with the intelligent son of Sumitra in his train, and will soon take thee<br>away hence! O lady, I have had a most terrible dream of evil omen,<br>indicating the destruction of this wicked-minded wretch of Pulastya's<br>race! This night wanderer of mean deeds is, indeed, most wicked and<br>cruel. He inspireth terror in all by the defects of his nature and the<br>wickedness of his conduct. And deprived of his senses by Fate, he<br>challengeth the very gods. In my vision I have seen every indication of<br>his downfall. I have seen the Ten-headed, with his crown shaven and body<br>besmeared with oil, sunk in mire, and the next moment dancing on a<br>chariot drawn by mules. I have seen Kumbhakarna and others, perfectly<br>naked and with crowns shaven, decked with red wreaths and unguents, and<br>running towards the southern direction. Vibhishana alone, with umbrella<br>over his head, and graced with a turban, and with body decked with white<br>wreaths and unguents, I beheld ascending the summit of the White hill.<br>And I saw four of his counsellors also, decked with white wreaths and<br>unguents, ascending the summit of that hill along with him. All this<br>bodeth that these alone will be saved from the impending terror. The<br>whole earth with its oceans and seas will be enveloped with Rama's<br>arrows. O lady, thy husband will fill the whole earth with his fame. I<br>also saw Lakshmana, consuming all directions (with his arrows) and<br>ascending on a heap of bones and drinking thereon honey and rice boiled<br>in milk. And thou, O lady, hast been beheld by me running towards a<br>northernly direction, weeping and covered with blood and protected by a<br>tiger! And, O princess of Videha, soon wilt thou find happiness, being<br>united, O Sita, with thy lord, that descendant of Raghu accompanied by<br>his brother!' Hearing these words of Trijata, that girl with eyes like<br>those of a young gazelle, once more began to entertain hopes of a union<br>with her lord. And when at last those fierce and cruel Pisacha guards<br>came back, they saw her sitting with Trijata as before."
