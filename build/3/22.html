                            "Vasudeva continued, 'Then O thou foremost of the Bharata race, taking up<br>my beautiful bow, I began to cut off with my arrows the heads of the<br>enemies of the celestials, from off that car of costly metals! And I<br>began to discharge from the Sharanga many well-looking arrows of the<br>forms of snakes, capable of going at a great height and possessing<br>intense energy. And, O perpetuator of the Kuru race, I could not then see<br>the car of costly metals, for it had vanished, through illusion! I was<br>then filled with wonder! That host of Danvas then, O Bharata, of<br>frightful visages and hair, set up a loud howl while I was waiting for<br>it. In that fierce battle. I then, with the object of destroying them,<br>fixed on my bow-string the weapon capable of piercing the foes if but his<br>sound was inaudible. Upon this, their shouts ceased. But those Danavas<br>that had sent up that shout were all slain by those shafts of mine<br>blazing as the Sun himself, and capable of striking at the perception of<br>sound alone. And after the shout had ceased at one place, O mighty king,<br>another yell proceeded from another quarter. Thitherto also I sent my<br>shafts. In this way, O Bharata, the Asuras began to send up yells in all<br>the ten quarters above and across. These were all slain by me, viz.,<br>those that were in the skies and that were invisible, with arrows of<br>diverse forms, and celestial weapons inspired with mantras. Then, O hero,<br>that car of precious metals capable of going anywhere at will,<br>bewildering my eyes, reappeared at Pragjyotisha! And then the destroying<br>Danavas of fierce forms suddenly drowned me with a mighty shower of<br>rocks. And, O thou foremost of monarchs, torrents of rocks falling upon<br>me covered me up, and I began to grow like an ant-hill (with its summits<br>and peaks)! And covered along with my horses and charioteer and<br>flagstaffs, with crags on all sides, I disappeared from sight altogether.<br>Then those foremost of heroes of the Vrishni race who were of my army<br>were, struck with panic, and all on a sudden began to fly in all<br>directions. And beholding me in that plight, O king, the heaven, the<br>firmament, and the earth were filled with exclamation of Oh! and Alas!<br>And then, O monarch, my friends filled with sorrow and grief began to<br>weep and wail with heavy hearts! And delight filled the hearts of the<br>enemies. And O thou who never waverest, I heard of this after I had<br>defeated the foe! And then wielding the thunderbolt, that favourite<br>(weapon) of Indra, capable of riving stones, I destroyed that entire mass<br>of crags! But my steeds, afflicted with the weight of the stones and<br>almost on the point of death began to tremble. And beholding me, all my<br>friends rejoiced again even as men rejoice on seeing the sun rise in the<br>sky, dispersing the clouds. And seeing my horses almost in their last<br>gasp for breath, afflicted with that load of stones, my charioteer said<br>unto me in words suitable to the occasion, 'O thou of the Vrishni race,<br>behold Salwa the owner of the car of precious metals sitting (yonder). Do<br>not disregard him! Do thou exert thyself! Do thou abandon thy mildness<br>and consideration for Salwa. Slay Salwa, O thou of mighty arms! O Kesava,<br>do not let him live! O hero, O thou destroyer of those that are not thy<br>friends (enemies), an enemy should be slain with every exertion! Even a<br>weak enemy who is under the feet of a man endued with strength, should<br>not be disregarded by the latter: that (shall I say) of one that dareth<br>us to the fight? Therefore, O thou tiger among men, putting forth every<br>exertion, slay him, O lord, O thou foremost of the Vrishni race! Do thou<br>not delay again! This one is not capable of being vanquished by milder<br>measures. And he cannot in my opinion be thy friend who is fighting thee<br>and who devastated Dwaraka!' O Kaunteya, hearing such words of my<br>charioteer, and knowing that what he said was true, I directed my<br>attention to the fight (afresh), with the view of slaying Salwa and<br>destroying the car of costly metals! And, O hero, saying unto Daruka,<br>'Stay a moment' I fixed on my bow-string my favourite weapon of fire,<br>blazing and of celestial origin, of irresistible force, and incapable of<br>being baffled, bursting with energy, capable of penetrating into<br>everything, and of great splendour! And saying, 'Destroy the car of<br>precious metals together with all those enemies that are in it.' I<br>launched with the might of my arms and in wrath with mantras, the great<br>powerful discus Sudarsana which reduceth to ashes in battle Yakshas and<br>Rakshasas and Danavas and kings born in impure tribes, sharp-edged like<br>the razor, and without stain, like unto Yama the destroyer, and<br>incomparable, and which killeth enemies. And rising into the sky, it<br>seemed like a second sun of exceeding effulgence at the end of the Yuga.<br>And approaching the town of Saubha whose splendour had disappeared, the<br>discus went right through it, even as a saw divideth a tall tree. And cut<br>in twain by the energy of the Sudarsana it fell like the city of Tripura<br>shaken by the shafts of Maheswara. And after the town of Saubha had<br>fallen, the discus came back into my hands, And taking it up I once more<br>hurled it with force saying, 'Go thou unto Salwa.' The discus then cleft<br>Salwa in twain who in that fierce conflict was at the point of hurling a<br>heavy mace. And with its energy it set the foe ablaze. And after that<br>brave warrior was slain, the disheartened Danava women fled in all<br>directions, exclaiming Oh! and Alas! And taking my chariot in front of<br>the town of Saubha I cheerfully blew my conch and gladdened the hearts of<br>my friends. And beholding their town, high as the peak of the Meru, with<br>its palaces and gate-ways utterly destroyed, and all ablaze, the Danavas<br>fled in fear. And having thus destroyed the town of Saubha and slain<br>Salwa, I returned to the Anarttas and delighted my friends. And, O king,<br>it is for this reason that I could not come to the city named after the<br>elephant (Hastinapura), O destroyer of hostile heroes! O warrior, if I<br>had come, Suyodhana would not have been alive or the match at dice would<br>not have taken place. What can I do now? It is difficult to confine the<br>waters after the dam is broken!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having addressed the Kaurava thus, that foremost<br>of male persons, of mighty arms, the slayer of Madhu, possessed of every<br>grace, saluting the Pandavas, prepared for departure. And the<br>mighty-armed hero reverentially saluted Yudhishthira the just, and the<br>king in return and Bhima also smelt the crown of his head. And he was<br>embraced by Arjuna, and the twins saluted him with reverence. And he was<br>duly honoured by Dhaumya, and worshipped with tears by Draupadi. And<br>causing Subhadra and Abhimanyu to ascend his golden car, Krishna, mounted<br>it himself, worshipped by the Pandavas. And consoling Yudhishthira,<br>Krishna set out for Dwaraka on his car resplendent as the sun and unto<br>which were yoked the horses Saivya and Sugriva. And after he of the<br>Dasharha race had departed, Dhristadyumna, the son of Prishata, also set<br>out for his own city, taking with him the sons of Draupadi. And the king<br>of Chedi, Dhrishtaketu also, taking his sister with him set out for his<br>beautiful city of Suktimati, after bidding farewell to the Pandavas. And,<br>O Bharata, the Kaikeyas also, with the permission of Kunti's son<br>possessed of immeasurable energy, having reverentially saluted all the<br>Pandavas, went away. But Brahmanas and the Vaisyas and the dwellers of<br>Yudhishthira's kingdom though repeatedly requested to go, did not leave<br>the Pandavas. O foremost of king, O bull of the Bharata race, the<br>multitude that surrounded those high-souled ones in the forest of Kamyaka<br>looked extraordinary. And Yudhishthira, honouring those high-minded<br>Brahmanas, in due time ordered his men, saying 'Make ready the car.'"
