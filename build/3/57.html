                            "Vrihadaswa continued, 'Then at the sacred hour of the holy lunar day of<br>the auspicious season, king Bhima summoned the kings to the Swayamvara.<br>And hearing of it, all the lords of earth smit with love speedily came<br>thither, desirous of (possessing) Damayanti. And the monarchs entered the<br>amphitheatre decorated with golden pillars and a lofty portal arch, like<br>mighty lions entering the mountain wilds. And those lords of earth decked<br>with fragrant garlands and polished ear-rings hung with jewels seated<br>themselves on their several seats. And that sacred assembly of Kings,<br>graced by those tigers among men, resembled the Bhogavati swarming with<br>the Nagas, or a mountain cavern with tigers. And their arms were robust,<br>and resembling iron maces, and well-shaped, and graceful, and looking<br>like five-headed snakes. And graced with beautiful locks and fine noses<br>and eyes and brows, the countenance of the kings shone like stars in the<br>firmament. And (when the time came), Damayanti of beauteous face,<br>stealing the eyes and hearts of the princes by her dazzling light,<br>entered the hall. And the glances of those illustrious kings were<br>rivetted to those parts of her person where they had chanced to fall<br>first, without moving at all. And when, O Bharata, the names of the<br>monarchs were proclaimed, the daughter of Bhima saw five persons all<br>alike in appearance. And beholding them seated there, without difference<br>of any kind in form, doubt filled her mind, and she could not ascertain<br>which of them was king Nala. And at whomsoever (among them) she looked,<br>she regarded him to be the king of the Nishadhas. And filled with<br>anxiety, the beauteous one thought within herself, 'Oh, how shall I<br>distinguish the celestials, and how discern the royal Nala?' And thinking<br>thus, the daughter of Vidarbha became filled with grief. And, O Bharata,<br>recollecting the marks belonging to the celestials, of which she had<br>heard, she thought, 'Those attributes of the celestials, of which I have<br>heard from the aged, do not pertain to any of these deities present here<br>upon the earth.' And revolving the matter long in her mind, and<br>reflecting upon it repeatedly, she decided upon seeking the protection of<br>the gods themselves. And bowing down unto them with mind and speech, with<br>folded hands, she addressed them trembling, 'Since I heard the speech of<br>the swans, I chose the king of the Nishadhas as my lord. For the sake of<br>truth, O, let the gods reveal him to me. And as in thought or word I have<br>never swerved from him, O, let the gods, for the sake of that truth,<br>reveal him to me. And as the gods themselves have destined the ruler of<br>the Nishadhas to be my lord, O, let them, for the sake of that truth,<br>reveal him to me. And as it is for paying homage unto Nala that I have<br>adopted this vow, for the sake of that truth, O, let the gods reveal him<br>unto me, O, let the exalted guardians of the worlds assume their own<br>proper forms, so that I may know the righteous king.' Hearing these<br>piteous words of Damayanti, and ascertaining her fixed resolve, and<br>fervent love for the king of Nishadhas, the purity of her heart and her<br>inclination and regard and affection for Nala, the gods did as they had<br>been adjured, and assumed their respective attributes as best they could.<br>And thereupon she beheld the celestials unmoistened with perspiration,<br>with winkless eyes, and unfading garlands, unstained with dust, and<br>staying without touching the ground. And Naishadha stood revealed to his<br>shadow, his fading garlands, himself stained with dust and sweat, resting<br>on the ground with winking eyes. And, O Bharata, discerning the gods and<br>the virtuous Nala the daughter of Bhima chose Naishadha according to her<br>truth. And the large-eyed damsel then bashfully caught the hem of his<br>garment and placed round his neck a floral wreath of exceeding grace. And<br>when that fair-complexioned maiden had thus chosen Nala for her husband,<br>the kings suddenly broke out into exclamations of Oh! and Alas! And, O<br>Bharata, the gods and the great Rishis in wonder cried Excellent!<br>Excellent!, applauding the king the while. And, O Kauravya, the royal son<br>of Virasena, with heart filled with gladness, comforted the beauteous<br>Damayanti, saying, 'Since thou, O blessed one, hast chosen a mortal in<br>the presence of the celestials, know me for a husband even obedient to<br>thy command. And, O thou of sweet smiles, truly do I tell thee this that<br>as long as life continueth in this body of mine, I will remain thine and<br>thine alone. Damayanti also, with folded hands paid homage unto Nala in<br>words of like import. And the happy pair beholding Agni and the other<br>gods mentally sought their protection. And after the daughter of Bhima<br>had chosen Naishadha as her husband, the Lokapalas of exceeding<br>effulgence with pleased hearts, bestowed on Nala eight boons. And Sakra,<br>the lord of Sachi, bestowed on Nala the boon that he should be able to<br>behold his godship in sacrifices and that he should attain to blessed<br>legions thereafter, and Hutasana bestowed on him the boon of his own<br>presence whenever Naishadha wished, and regions also bright as himself.<br>And Yama granted him subtle taste in food as well as pre-eminence in<br>virtue. And the lord of waters granted Nala his own presence whenever he<br>desired, and also garlands of celestial fragrance. And thus each of them<br>bestowed upon him a couple of boons. And having bestowed these the gods<br>went to heaven. And the kings also, having witnessed with wonder<br>Damayanti's selection of Nala, returned delighted whence they had come.<br>And on the departure of those mighty monarchs, the high-souled Bhima,<br>well pleased, celebrated the wedding of Nala and Damayanti. And having<br>stayed there for a time according to his desire, Naishadha, the best of<br>men, returned to his own city with the permission of Bhima. And having<br>attained that pearl of a woman, the virtuous king, O monarch, began to<br>pass his days in joy, like the slayer of Vala and Vritra in the company<br>of Sachi. And resembling the sun in glory, the king, full of gladness,<br>began to rule his subjects righteously, and give them great satisfaction.<br>And like unto Yayati, the son of Nahusha, that intelligent monarch<br>celebrated the horse sacrifice and many other sacrifices with abundant<br>gifts to Brahmanas. And like unto a very god, Nala sported with Damayanti<br>in romantic woods and groves. And the high-minded king begat upon<br>Damayanti a son named Indrasena, and a daughter named Indrasena. And<br>celebrating sacrifice, and sporting (with Damayanti) thus, the king ruled<br>the earth abounding in wealth.'"
