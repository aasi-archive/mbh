                            "Lomasa said, 'O descendant of Bharata! she in order to compass the<br>object of the king, prepared a floating hermitage, both because the king<br>had ordered so, and also because it exactly accorded with her plan. And<br>the floating hermitage, containing artificial trees adorned with various<br>flowers and fruits, and surrounded by diverse shrubs and creeping plants<br>and capable of furnishing choice and delicious fruits, was exceedingly<br>delightful, and nice, and pleasing, and looked as if it had been created<br>by magic. Then she moored the vessel at no great distance from the<br>hermitage of Kasyapa's son, and sent emissaries to survey the place where<br>that same saint habitually went about. And then she saw an opportunity;<br>and having conceived a plan in her mind, sent forward her daughter a<br>courtesan by trade and of smart sense. And that clever woman went to the<br>vicinity of the religious man and arriving at the hermitage beheld the<br>son of the saint.'"<br><br>"The courtesan said, 'I hope, O saint! that is all well with the<br>religious devotees. And I hope that thou hast a plentiful store of fruits<br>and roots and that thou takest delight in this hermitage. Verily I come<br>here now to pay thee a visit. I hope the practice of austerities among<br>the saints is on the increase. I hope that thy father's spirit hath not<br>slackened and that he is well pleased with thee. O Rishyasringa of the<br>priestly caste! I hope thou prosecutest the studies proper for thee.'"<br><br>Rishyasringa said, 'Thou art shining with lustre, as if thou wert a<br>(mass) of light. And I deem thee worthy of obeisance. Verily I shall give<br>thee water for washing thy feet and such fruits and roots also as may be<br>liked by thee, for this is what my religion hath prescribed to me. Be<br>thou pleased to take at thy pleasure thy seat on a mat made of the sacred<br>grass, covered over with a black deer-skin and made pleasant and<br>comfortable to sit upon. And where is thy hermitage? O Brahmana! thou<br>resemblest a god in thy mien. What is the name of this particular<br>religious vow, which thou seemest to be observing now?'<br><br>"The courtesan said, O son of Kasyapa! on the other side of yonder hill,<br>which covers the space of three Yojanas, is my hermitage&#8212;a delightful<br>place. There, not to receive obeisance is the rule of my faith nor do I<br>touch water for washing my feet. I am not worthy of obeisance from<br>persons like thee; but I must make obeisance to thee. O Brahmana! This is<br>the religious observance to be practised by me, namely, that thou must be<br>clasped in my arms.'"<br><br>"Rishyasringa said, 'Let me give thee ripe fruits, such as gallnuts,<br>myrobalans, Karushas, Ingudas from sandy tracts and Indian fig. May it<br>please thee to take a delight in them!'"<br><br>Lomasa said, "She, however, threw aside all those edible things and then<br>gave him unsuitable things for food. And these were exceedingly nice and<br>beautiful to see and were very much acceptable to Rishyasringa. And she<br>gave him garlands of an exceedingly fragrant scent and beautiful and<br>shining garments to wear and first-rate drinks; and then played and<br>laughed and enjoyed herself. And she at his sight played with a ball and<br>while thus employed, looked like a creeping plant broken in two. And she<br>touched his body with her own and repeatedly clasped Rishyasringa in her<br>arms. Then she bent and break the flowery twigs from trees, such as the<br>Sala, the Asoka and the Tilaka. And overpowered with intoxication,<br>assuming a bashful look, she went on tempting the great saint's son. And<br>when she saw that the heart of Rishyasringa had been touched, she<br>repeatedly pressed his body with her own and casting glances, slowly went<br>away under the pretext that she was going to make offerings on the fire.<br>On her departure, Rishyasringa became over-powered with love and lost his<br>sense. His mind turned constantly to her and felt itself vacant. And he<br>began to sigh and seemed to be in great distress. At that moment appeared<br>Vibhandaka, Kasyapa's son, he whose eyes were tawny like those of a lion,<br>whose body was covered with hair down to the tip of the nails, who was<br>devoted to studies proper for his caste, and whose life was pure and was<br>passed in religious meditation. He came up and saw that his son was<br>seated alone, pensive and sad, his mind upset and sighing again and again<br>with upturned eyes. And Vibhandaka spake to his distressed son, saying,<br>'My boy! why is it that thou art not hewing the logs for fuel. I hope<br>thou hast performed the ceremony of burnt offering today. I hope thou<br>hast polished the sacrificial ladles and spoons and brought the calf to<br>the milch cow whose milk furnisheth materials for making offerings on the<br>fire. Verily thou art not in thy wonted state, O son! Thou seemest to be<br>pensive, and to have lost thy sense. Why art thou so sad today? Let me<br>ask thee, who hath been to this place today?'"
