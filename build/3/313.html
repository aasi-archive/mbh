                            Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Commanded by the Lord of justice to thus spend<br>in disguise the thirteenth year of non-discovery, the high-souled<br>Pandavas, observant of vows and having truth for prowess, sat before<br>those learned and vow-observing ascetics that from regard were dwelling<br>with them in their exile in the forest. And with joined hands they said<br>these words, with the intention of obtaining permission to spend the<br>thirteenth year in the manner indicated. And they said, 'Ye know well<br>that the sons of Dhritarashtra have by deceit deprived us of our kingdom,<br>and have also done us many other wrongs! We have passed twelve years in<br>the forest in great affliction. The thirteenth year only, which we are to<br>spend unrecognised, yet remaineth. It behoveth you to permit us now to<br>spend this year in concealment! Those rancorous enemies of ours<br>Suyodhana, the wicked-minded Kama, and Suvala's son should they discover<br>us, would do mighty wrong to the citizens and our friends! Shall we all<br>with the Brahmanas, be again established in our own kingdom? Having said<br>this, that pure-spirited son of Dharma king Yudhishthira, overwhelmed<br>with grief and with accents choked in tears, swooned away. Thereupon the<br>Brahmanas, together with his brothers began to cheer him up. Then Dhaumya<br>spake unto the king these words fraught with mighty meaning,&#8212;'O king,<br>thou art learned and capable of bearing privations, art firm in promise,<br>and of subdued sense! Men of such stamp are not overwhelmed by any<br>calamity whatever. Even the high-souled gods themselves have wandered<br>over various places in disguise, for the purpose of overcoming foes.<br>Indra for the purpose of overcoming his toes, dwelt in disguise in the<br>asylum of Giriprastha, in Nishadha and thus attained his end. Before<br>taking his birth in the womb of Aditi, Vishnu for the purpose of<br>destroying the Daityas passed a long time unrecognised, assuming the form<br>of the Haya-griba (Horse-necked). Then how disguising himself in the form<br>of a dwarf, he by his prowess deprived Vali of his kingdom, hath been<br>heard by thee! And thou hast also heard how Hutasana entering into water<br>and remaining in concealment, achieved the purpose of the gods. And O<br>thou versed in duty, thou hast heard how Hari with the view of overcoming<br>his foes, entered into Sakra's thunder-bolt, and lay concealed there.<br>And, O sinless one, thou hast heard of the office the regenerate Rishi<br>Aurva at one time performed for the gods, remaining concealed in his<br>mother's womb. And O child, living in concealment in every part of the<br>earth, Vivaswat, endued with excellent energy, at last entirely burnt up<br>all his foes. And living disguised in the abode of Dasaratha, Vishnu of<br>dreadful deeds slew the Ten-necked one in battle.' Thus remaining in<br>disguise in various places, high-souled persons have before this<br>conquered their enemies in battle. Thus cheered by these words of<br>Dhaumya, the virtuous Yudhishthira, relying on his own wisdom and also<br>that acquired from the scriptures regained his composure. Then that<br>foremost of strong persons, the mighty-armed Bhimasena endued with great<br>strength encouraging the king greatly, spake these words, 'Looking up to<br>thy face (for permission), the wielder of the Gandiva, acting according<br>to his sense of duty hath not yet, O king, shown any rashness! And<br>although fully able to destroy the foe, Nakula and Sahadeva of dreadful<br>prowess have been ever prevented by me! Never shall we swerve from that<br>in which thou wilt engage us! Do thou tell us what is to be done! We<br>shall speedily conquer our enemies! When Bhimasena had said this, the<br>Brahmanas uttered benedictions on the Bharatas, and then obtaining their<br>permission, went to their respective quarters. And all those foremost of<br>Yatis and Munis versed in the Vedas, exceedingly desirous of again<br>beholding the Pandavas, went back to their homes. And accompanied by<br>Dhaumya, these heroes, the five learned Pandavas equipped in vows set out<br>with Krishna. And each versed in a separate science, and all proficient<br>in mantras and cognisant of when peace was to be concluded and when war<br>was to be waged those tigers among men, about to enter upon a life of<br>non-recognition, the next day proceeded for a Krose and then sat<br>themselves down with the view of taking counsel of each other.<br><br>The End of Vana Parva
