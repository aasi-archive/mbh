                            "Lomasa said, 'That blessed saint, the son of Varuna, having reached the<br>sea spake unto the assembled gods, and the saints gathered together,<br>saying 'I surely am going to drink up the ocean&#8212;that abode of the god of<br>waters. Be ye quickly ready with those preparations which it devolves<br>upon you to make.' Having spoken these few words, the unswerving<br>offspring of Mitra and Varuna, full of wrath, began to drink up the sea,<br>while all the worlds stood observing (the deed). Then the gods, together<br>with Indra, seeing how the sea was being drunk up, were struck with<br>mighty amazement, and glorified him with laudatory words, saying, 'Thou<br>art our protector, and the Providence itself for men,&#8212;and also the<br>creator of the worlds. By thy favour the universe with its gods may<br>possibly be saved from havoc.' And the magnanimous one, glorified by the<br>gods&#8212;while the musical instruments of celestial choristers were playing<br>all round, and while celestial blossoms were showered upon him&#8212;rendered<br>waterless the wide ocean. And seeing the wide ocean rendered devoid of<br>water, the host of gods was exceedingly glad; and taking up choice<br>weapons of celestial forge, fell to slaying the demons with courageous<br>hearts,&#8212;And they, assailed by the magnanimous gods, of great strength,<br>and swift of speed, and roaring loudly, were unable to withstand the<br>onset of their fleet and valorous (foes)&#8212;those residents of the heavenly<br>regions, O descendant of Bharata! And those demons, attacked by the gods,<br>bellowing loudly, for a moment carried on terrible conflict. They had<br>been in the first instance burnt by the force of penances performed by<br>the saints, who had matured their selves; therefore, the demons, though<br>they tried to the utmost, were at last slaughtered by the gods. And<br>decked with brooches of gold, and bearing on their persons ear-rings and<br>armlets, the demons, when slain, looked beautiful indeed, like palasa<br>trees when full of blossoms. Then, O best of men! a few&#8212;the remnant of<br>those that were killed of the Kalakeya race, having rent asunder the<br>goddess Earth, took refuge at the bottom of the nether regions. And the<br>gods, when they saw that the demons were slain, with diverse speeches,<br>glorified the mighty saint, and spake the following words. 'O thou of<br>mighty arms, by thy favour men have attained a mighty blessing, and the<br>Kalakeyas, of ruthless strength have been killed by thy power, O creator<br>of beings! Fill the sea (now), O mighty-armed one; give up again the<br>water drunk up by thee.' Thus addressed, the blessed and mighty saint<br>replied, 'That water in sooth hath been digested by me. Some other<br>expedient, therefore, must be thought of by you, if ye desire to make<br>endeavour to fill the ocean.' Hearing this speech of that saint of<br>matured soul, the assembled gods were struck with both wonder and<br>sadness, O great king! And thereupon, having bidden adieu to each other,<br>and bowed to the mighty saint all the born beings went their way. And the<br>gods with Vishnu, came to Brahma. And having held consultation again,<br>with the view of filling up the sea, they, with joined hands, spake about<br>replenishing it."
