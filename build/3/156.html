                            Vaisampayana continued, "Thus dwelling with the Brahmanas in that best of<br>mountains, in expectation of Arjuna's return, when the Pandavas had grown<br>confident and when all those Rakshasas together with Bhima's son had<br>departed, one day while Bhimasena was away, a Rakshasa all of a sudden<br>carried off Yudhishthira the just and the twins and Krishna. That<br>Rakshasa (in the guise of a Brahmana) had constantly remained in the<br>company of the Pandavas, alleging that he was a high-class Brahmana,<br>skilled in counsel, and versed in all the Sastras. His object was to<br>possess himself of the bows, the quivers and the other material<br>implements belonging to the Pandavas; and he had been watching for an<br>opportunity of ravishing Draupadi. And that wicked and sinful one was<br>named Jatasura. And, O king of kings, Pandu's son (Yudhishthira) had been<br>supporting him, but knew not that wretch like unto a fire covered with<br>ashes.<br><br>"And once on a day while that represser of foes, Bhimasena, was out a<br>hunting, he (the Rakshasa), seeing Ghatotkacha and his followers scatter<br>in different directions and seeing those vow-observing great rishis, of<br>ascetic wealth, viz.; Lomasa and the rest, away for bathing and<br>collecting flowers, assumed a different form, gigantic and monstrous and<br>frightful; and having secured all the arms (of the Pandavas) as also<br>Draupadi, that wicked one fled away taking the three Pandavas. Thereupon<br>that son of Pandu, Sahadeva, extricated himself with exertion, and by<br>force snatched the sword named Kausika from the grasp of the enemy and<br>began to call Bhimasena, taking the direction in which that mighty one<br>had gone. And on being carried off Yudhishthira the just, addressed him<br>(that Rakshasa), saying, 'O stupid one, thy merit decreaseth (even by<br>this act of thine). Dost thou not pay heed unto the established order of<br>nature? Whether belonging to the human race, or to the lower orders, all<br>pay regard to virtue,&#8212;more specially the Rakshasas. In the first<br>instance, they knew virtue better than others. Having considered all<br>these, thou ought to adhere to virtue. O Rakshasa, the gods, the pitris,<br>the Siddhas, the rishis, the Gandharvas, the brutes and even the worms<br>and ants depend for their lives on men; and thou too liveth through that<br>agency. If prosperity attendeth the human race, thy race also prospereth;<br>and if calamities befall the former, even the celestials suffer grief.<br>Being gratified by offerings, do the gods thrive. O Rakshasa, we are the<br>guardians, governors and preceptors of kingdoms. If kingdoms become<br>unprotected, whence can proceed prosperity and happiness? Unless there be<br>offence, a Rakshasa should not violate a king. O man-eating one, we have<br>committed no wrong, ever so little. Living on vighasa, we serve the gods<br>and others to the best of our power. And we are never intent upon bowing<br>down to our superiors and Brahmanas. A friend, and one confiding, and he<br>whose food hath been partaken of, and he that hath afforded shelter,<br>should never be injured. Thou hast lived in our place happily, being duly<br>honoured. And, O evil-minded one, having partaken of our food, how canst<br>thou carry us off? And as thy acts are so improper and as thou hast grown<br>in age without deriving any benefit and as thy propensities are evil, so<br>thou deservest to die for nothing, and for nothing wilt thou die to-day.<br>And if thou beest really evil-disposed and devoid of all virtue, do thou<br>render us back our weapons and ravish Draupadi after fight. But if<br>through stupidity thou must do this deed, then in the world thou wilt<br>only reap demerit and infamy O Rakshasa, by doing violence to this female<br>of the human race, thou hast drunk poison, after having shaken the<br>vessel.' Thereupon, Yudhishthira made himself ponderous to the Rakshasa.<br>And being oppressed with the weight, he could not proceed rapidly as<br>before. Then addressing Draupadi, Nakula and Sahadeva, Yudhishthira said,<br>'Do ye not entertain any fear of this wretched Rakshasa, I have checked<br>his speed. The mighty-armed son of the Wind-god may not be far away; and<br>on Bhima coming up at the next moment, the Rakshasa will not live.' O<br>king, staring at the Rakshasa bereft of sense, Sahadeva addressed<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, saying, 'What can be more meritorious for<br>a Kshatriya than to fall in fight, or defeat a foe? O repressor of foes,<br>we will fight and either this one will slay us, or we shall slay him, O<br>mighty-armed one. Verily this is the place and time. O king. And, O thou<br>of unfailing prowess, the time hath come for the display of our Kshatriya<br>virtue. It behoveth us to attain heaven either by gaining victory or<br>being slain. If the sun sets to-day, the Rakshasa living yet, O Bharata,<br>I will not any more say that I am a Kshatriya. Ho! Ho! Rakshasa. say! I<br>am Pandu's son, Sahadeva. Either, after having killed me, carry off this<br>lady, or being slain, lie senseless here.'<br><br>"Madri's son, Sahadeva, was speaking thus, when Bhimasena made his<br>appearance, with a mace in his hand, like unto Vasava himself wielding<br>the thunder-bolt. And here he saw his two brothers and the noble-minded<br>Draupadi (on the shoulders of the demon), and Sahadeva on the ground<br>rebuking the Rakshasa and also that stupid Rakshasa himself deprived of<br>sense by Fate, going round in different directions through bewilderment<br>caused by Destiny. And finding his brothers and Draupadi being carried<br>off, Bhima of mighty strength was fired with wrath, and addressed the<br>Rakshasa, saying, 'I had ere this found thee out for a wicked wight from<br>thy scrutiny of our weapons; but as I had no apprehension of thee, so I<br>had not slain thee at that time. Thou wert in the disguise of a<br>Brahmana&#8212;nor didst thou say anything harsh unto us. And thou didst take<br>delight in pleasing us. And thou also didst not do us wrong. And,<br>furthermore, thou wert our guest. How could I, therefore, slay thee, who<br>wert thus innocent of offence, and who wert in the disguise of a<br>Brahmana? He that knowing such a one to be even a Rakshasa, slayeth him,<br>goes to hell. Further, thou canst not be killed before the time cometh.<br>Surely to-day thou hast reached the fullness of thy time in as much as<br>thy mind hath been thus turned by the wonder-performing Fate towards<br>carrying off Krishna. By committing thyself to this deed, thou hast<br>swallowed up the hook fastened to the line of Fate. So like unto a fish<br>in water, whose mouth hath been hooked, how canst thou live to-day? Thou<br>shall not have to go whither thou intendest to, or whither thou hadst<br>already gone mentally; but thou shall go whither have repaired Vaka and<br>Hidimva.'<br><br>"Thus addressed by Bhima, the Rakshasa in alarm put them down; and being<br>forced by Fate, approached for fight. And with his lips trembling in<br>anger he spake unto Bhima, saying, 'Wretch! I have not been bewildered; I<br>had been delaying for thee. To day will I offer oblations of thy blood to<br>those Rakshasas who, I had heard, have been slain by thee in fight' Thus<br>addressed, Bhima, as if bursting with wrath, like unto Yama himself at<br>the time of the universal dissolution, rushed towards the Rakshasa,<br>licking the corners of his mouth and staring at him as he struck his own<br>arms with the hands. And seeing Bhima waiting in expectation of fight,<br>the Rakshasa also darted towards him in anger, like unto Vali towards the<br>wielder of the thunderbolt, repeatedly gaping and licking the corners of<br>his mouth. And when a dreadful wrestling ensued between those two, both<br>the sons of Madri, waxing exceeding wroth rushed forward; but Kunti's<br>son, Vrikodara, forbade them with a smile and said, 'Witness ye! I am<br>more than a match for this Rakshasa. By my own self and by my brothers,<br>and by my merit, and by my good deeds, and by my sacrifices, do I swear<br>that I shall slay this Rakshasa.' And after this was said, those two<br>heroes, the Rakshasa and Vrikodara challenging each other, caught each<br>other by the arms. And they not forgiving each other, then there ensued a<br>conflict between the infuriated Bhima and the Rakshasa, like unto that<br>between a god and a demon. And repeatedly uprooting trees, those two of<br>mighty strength struck each other, shouting and roaring like two masses<br>of clouds. And those foremost of athletes, each wishing to kill the<br>other, and rushing at the other with vehemence, broke down many a<br>gigantic tree by their thighs. Thus that encounter with trees,<br>destructive of plants, went on like unto that between the two brothers<br>Vali and Sugriva&#8212;desirous of the possession of a single woman.<br>Brandishing trees for a moment, they struck each other with them,<br>shouting incessantly. And when all the trees of the spot had been pulled<br>down and crushed into fibres by them endeavouring to kill each other,<br>then, O Bharata, those two of mighty strength, taking up rocks, began to<br>fight for a while, like unto a mountain and a mighty mass of clouds. And<br>not suffering each other, they fell to striking each other with hard and<br>large crags, resembling vehement thunder-bolts. Then from strength<br>defying each other, they again darted at each other, and grasping each<br>other by their arms, began to wrestle like unto two elephants. And next<br>they dealt each other fierce blows. And then those two mighty ones began<br>to make chattering sounds by gnashing their teeth. And at length, having<br>clenched his fist like a five-headed snake, Bhima with force dealt a blow<br>on the neck of the Rakshasa. And when struck by that fist of Bhima, the<br>Rakshasa became faint, Bhimasena stood, catching hold of that exhausted<br>one. And then the god-like mighty-armed Bhima lifted him with his two<br>arms, and dashing him with force on the ground, the son of Pandu smashed<br>all his limbs. And striking him with his elbow, he severed from his body<br>the head with bitten lips and rolling eyes, like unto a fruit from its<br>stem. And Jatasura's head being severed by Bhimasena's might, he fell<br>besmeared with gore, and having bitten lips. Having slain Jatasura, Bhima<br>presented himself before Yudhishthira, and the foremost Brahmanas began<br>to eulogise him (Bhima) even as the Marutas (eulogise) Vasava."
