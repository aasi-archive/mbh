                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Desirous of living in the forest, those bulls of the<br>Bharata race, the Pandavas, with their followers, setting out from the<br>banks of the Ganges went to the field of Kurukshetra. And performing<br>their ablutions in the Saraswati, the Drisadwati and the Yamuna, they<br>went from one forest to another, travelling in an westernly direction.<br>And at length they saw before them the woods, Kamyaka, the favourite<br>haunt of Munis, situated by a level and wild plain on the banks of the<br>Saraswati. And in those woods, O Bharata, abounding in birds and deer,<br>those heroes began to dwell, entertained and comforted by the Munis. And<br>Vidura always longing to see the Pandavas, went in a single car to the<br>Kamyaka woods abounding in every good thing. And arriving at Kamyaka on a<br>car drawn by swift steeds, he saw Yudhishthira the just, sitting with<br>Draupadi at a retired spot, surrounded by his brothers and the Brahmanas.<br>And seeing Vidura approach from a distance with swift steps, the virtuous<br>king addressed brother, Bhimasena, saying, 'With what message doth<br>Kshatta come to us? Doth he come hither, despatched by Sakuni, to invite<br>us again to a game of dice? Doth the little-minded Sakuni intend to win<br>again our weapons at dice? O Bhimasena, challenged by any one addressing<br>me,&#8212;Come, I am unable to stay. And if our possession of the Gandiva<br>becomes doubtful, will not the acquisition of our kingdom also be so.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'O king, the Pandavas then rose up and welcomed<br>Vidura. And received by them, that descendant of the Ajamida line<br>(Vidura) sat in their midst and made the usual enquiries. And after<br>Vidura had rested awhile, those bulls among men asked him the reason of<br>his coming. And Vidura began to relate unto them in detail everything<br>connected with the bearing of Dhritarashtra the son of Amvika.'<br><br>"Vidura said, 'O Ajatasatru, Dhritarashtra called me, his dependant,<br>before him and honouring me duly said, 'Things have fared thus. Now, do<br>thou tell me what is good for the Pandavas as well as for me. I pointed<br>out what was beneficial to both the Kauravas and Dhritarashtra. But what<br>I said was not relished by him, nor could I hit upon any other course.<br>What I advised was, O Pandavas, highly beneficial, but the son of Amvika<br>heeded me not. Even as medicine recommendeth itself not to one that is<br>ill, so my words failed to please the king. And, O thou without a foe, as<br>all unchaste wile in the family of a man of pure descent cannot be<br>brought back to the path of virtue, so I failed to bring Dhritarashtra<br>back. Indeed, as a young damsel doth not like a husband of three score,<br>even so Dhritarashtra did not like my words. Surely, destruction will<br>overtake the Kuru race, surely Dhritarashtra will never acquire good<br>fortune. For, as water dropped on a lotus-leaf doth not remain there, my<br>counsels will fail to produce any effect to Dhritarashtra. The incensed<br>Dhritarashtra told me, O Bharata, go thou thither where thou likest Never<br>more shall I seek thy aid in ruling the earth or my capital,&#8212;O best of<br>monarchs, forsaken by king Dhritarashtra, I come to thee for tendering<br>good counsel. What I had said in the open court, I will now repeat unto<br>thee. Listen, and bear my words in mind,&#8212;that wise man who bearing all<br>the gross wrong heaped upon him by his enemies, patiently bideth his<br>time, and multiplieth his resources "even as men by degrees turn a small<br>fire: into a large one, ruleth alone this entire earth. He that (in<br>prosperity) enjoyeth his substance with his adherents findeth in them<br>sharers of his adversity,&#8212;this is the best means of securing adherents,<br>and it is said that he that hath adherents, winneth the sovereignty of<br>the world! And, O Pandava, divided thy prosperity with thy adherents,<br>behave truthfully towards them, and converse with them agreeably! Share<br>also your food with them! And never boast thyself in their presence! This<br>behaviour increaseth the prosperity of kings!'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Having recourse to such high intelligence,<br>undisturbed by passion, I will do as thou counsellest! And whatever else<br>thou mayst counsel in respect of time and place, I will carefully follow<br>entirely.'"
