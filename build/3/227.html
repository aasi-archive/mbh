                            "Markandeya continued, 'Now hear of those terrible and curious-looking<br>followers of Skanda. A number of male children came into being when<br>Skanda was struck with the thunder-bolt,&#8212;those terrific creatures that<br>steal (spirit away) little children, whether born, or in the womb and a<br>number of female children too of great strength were born to him. Those<br>children adopted Visakha as their father. That adorable and dexterous<br>Bhadrasakha, having a face like that of a goat was at the time (of the<br>battle), surrounded by all his sons and daughters whom he guarded<br>carefully in the presence of the great mothers. And for this reason the<br>inhabitants of this earth call Skanda the father of Kumaras (little<br>children). Those persons who desire to have sons born to them, worship in<br>their places the powerful Rudra in the form of the Fire-god, and Uma in<br>the form of Swaha. And by that means they are blessed with sons. The<br>daughters begotten by the Fire-god, Tapa, went over to Skanda, who said<br>to them, 'What can I do for you?' Those girls replied, 'Do us this<br>favour; by thy blessing, may we become the good and respected mothers of<br>all the world!' He replied, 'Be it so.' And that liberal-minded being<br>repeated again and again, 'Ye shall be divided into Siva and Asiva.'[76]<br>And the mothers then departed, having first established Skanda's sonship,<br>Kaki, Halima, Malini, Vrinhila, Arya, Palala and Vaimitra, these were the<br>seven mothers of Sisu. They had a powerful, red-eyed, terrific, and very<br>turbulent son named Sisu born by the blessing of Skanda. He was reputed<br>as the eighth hero, born of the mothers of Skanda. But he is also known<br>as the ninth, when that being with the face of a goat, is included. Know<br>that the sixth face of Skanda was like that of a goat. That face, O king,<br>is situated in the middle of the six, and is regarded constantly by the<br>mother. That head by which Bhadrasakha created the divine energy, is<br>reputed to be the best of all his heads O ruler of men, these virtuous<br>wonderful events happened on the fifth day of the bright half of the<br>lunar month, and on the sixth, a very fierce and terrific battle was<br>fought at that place."
