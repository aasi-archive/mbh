                            Vaisampayana said, "Having heard these words of Karna, king Duryodhana<br>became highly pleased. Soon after, however, the prince became melancholy<br>and addressing the speaker said, 'What thou tellest me, O Karna, is<br>always before my mind. I shall not, however, obtain permission to repair<br>to the place where the Pandavas are residing. King Dhritarashtra is<br>always grieving for those heroes. Indeed, the king regarded the sons of<br>Pandu to have become more powerful than before in consequence of their<br>ascetic austerities. Or, if the king understands our motives, he will<br>never, having regard to the future, grant us permission, for, O thou of<br>great effulgence, we can have no other business in the woods of<br>Dwaitavana than the destruction of the Pandavas in exile! Thou knowest<br>the words that Kshatri spoke to me to thyself, and to the son of Suvala,<br>at the time of the match at dice! Reflecting upon all those words as also<br>upon all those lamentations (that he and others indulged in), I cannot<br>make up my mind as to whether I should or should not go! I shall<br>certainly be highly pleased if I cast my eyes on Bhima and Phalguna<br>passing their days in pain with Krishna in the woods. The joy that I may<br>feel in obtaining the sovereignty of the entire earth is nothing to that<br>which will be mine upon beholding the sons of Pandu attired in barks of<br>trees and deer-skins. What joy can be greater, O Karna, that will be mine<br>upon beholding the daughter of Drupada dressed in red rags in the woods?<br>If king Yudhishthira and Bhima, the sons of Pandu, behold me graced with<br>great affluence, then only shall I have attained the great end of my<br>life! I do not, however, see the means by which I may repair to those<br>woods, by which, in fact, I may obtain the king's permission to go<br>thither! Contrive thou, therefore, some skilful plan, with Suvala's son<br>and Dussasana, by which we may go to those woods! I also, making up my<br>mind today as to whether I should go or not, approach the presence of the<br>king tomorrow. And when I shall be sitting with Bhishma&#8212;that best of the<br>Kurus&#8212;thou wilt, with Sakuni propose the pretext which thou mayst have<br>contrived. Hearing then the words of Bhishma and of the king on the<br>subject of our journey, I will settle everything beseeching our<br>grandfather.<br><br>"Saying; 'So be it,' they then all went away to their respective<br>quarters. And as soon as the night had passed away, Karna came to the<br>king. And coming to him, Karna smilingly spoke unto Duryodhana, saying,<br>'A plan hath been contrived by me. Listen to it, O lord of men! Our herds<br>are now waiting in the woods of Dwaitavana in expectation of thee!<br>Without doubt, we may all go there under the pretext of supervising our<br>cattle stations, for, O monarch, it is proper that kings should<br>frequently repair to their cattle stations. If this be the motive put<br>forth, thy father, O prince, will certainly grant thee permission!' And<br>while Duryodhana and Karna were thus conversing laughingly, Sakuni<br>addressed them and said, 'This plan, free from difficulties, was what I<br>also saw for going thither! The king will certainly grant us permission,<br>or even send us thither of his own accord. Our herds are now all waiting<br>in the woods of Dwaitavana expecting thee. Without doubt, we may all go<br>there under the pretext of supervising our cattle stations!'<br><br>"They then all three laughed together, and gave their hands unto one<br>another. And having arrived at that conclusion, they went to see the<br>chief of Kurus."
