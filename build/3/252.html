                            Vaisampayana continued, "Then, O bull among the Bharatas, that mighty<br>bowman, Karna, surrounded by a large army, besieged the beautiful city of<br>Drupada. And he, after a hard conflict, brought the hero under<br>subjection, and, O best of monarchs, made Drupada contribute silver and<br>gold and gems, and also pay tribute. And, O foremost of kings, having<br>subdued him, (Karna) brought under subjection those princes that were<br>under him (Drupada) and made them pay tribute. Then going to the north,<br>he subdued the sovereigns (of that quarter) and having effected the<br>defeat of Bhagadatta, Radha's son ascended that mighty mountain Himavat,<br>all along fighting his foes. And ranging all sides, he conquered and<br>brought under subjection all the kings inhabiting the Himavat, and made<br>them pay dues. Then descending from the mountain and rushing to the east,<br>he reduced the Angas, and the Bangas, and the Kalingas, and the Mandikas,<br>and the Magadhas. the Karkakhandas; and also included with them the<br>Avasiras, Yodhyas, and the Ahikshatras. Having (thus) conquered the<br>eastern quarter Karna then presented himself before Batsa-bhumi. And<br>having taken Batsa-bhumi, he reduced Kevali, and Mrittikavati, and Mohana<br>and Patrana, and Tripura, and Kosala,&#8212;and compelled all these to pay<br>tribute. Then going to the south, Karna vanquished the mighty charioteers<br>(of that quarter) and in Dakshinatya, the Suta's son entered into<br>conflict with Rukmi. After having fought dreadfully, Rukmi spake to the<br>Suta's son saying, 'O foremost of monarchs, I have been pleased with thy<br>might and prowess. I shall not do thee wrong: I have only fulfilled the<br>vow of a Kshatriya. Gladly will I give thee as many gold coins as thou<br>desirest.' Having met with Rukmi, Karna, repaired to Pandya and the<br>mountain, Sri. And by fighting, he made Karala, king Nila, Venudari's<br>son, and other best of kings living in the southern direction pay<br>tribute. Then going to Sisupala's son, the son of the Suta defeated him<br>and that highly powerful one also brought under his sway all the<br>neighbouring rulers. And, O bull of the Bharata race, having subjugated<br>the Avantis and concluded peace with them, and having met with the<br>Vrishnis, he conquered the west. And, having come to the quarter of<br>Varuna, he made all the Yavana and Varvara kings pay tribute. And, having<br>conquered the entire earth&#8212;east, west, north and south&#8212;that hero<br>without any aid brought under subjection all the nations of the<br>Mlechchhas, the mountaineers, the Bhadras, the Rohitakas, the Agneyas and<br>the Malavas. And, having conquered the mighty charioteers, headed by the<br>Nagnajitas, the Suta's son brought the Sasakas and the Yavanas under his<br>sway. Having thus conquered and brought under his subjection the world,<br>the mighty charioteer and tiger among men came (back) to Hastinapura.<br>That lord of men, Dhritarashtra's son, accompanied by his father and<br>brothers and friends, came to that mighty bowman, who had arrived, and<br>duly paid homage unto Karna crowned with martial merit. And the king<br>proclaimed his feats, saying, 'What I have not received from either<br>Bhishma, or Drona, or Kripa, or Vahlika, I have received from thee. May<br>good betide thee! What need of speaking at length! Hear my words, O<br>Karna! In thee, O chief of men, I have my refuge. O mighty-armed one. O<br>tiger among men, without doubt all the Pandavas and the other kings<br>crowned with prosperity, come not to a sixteenth part of thee. Do thou, O<br>mighty bowman, O Karna, see Dhritarashtra, and the illustrious Gandhari,<br>as the bearer of the thunderbolt did Aditi.'<br><br>"Then, O king, there arose in the city of Hastinapura a clamour, and<br>sounds of Oh! and Alas! and, O lord of men, some of the kings praised him<br>(Karna), while others censured him, while others, again, remained silent.<br>Having thus, O foremost of monarchs, in a short time conquered this earth<br>furnished with mountains and forests and skies, and with oceans, and<br>fields, and filled with high and low tracts, and cities, and replete also<br>with islands. O lord of earth, and brought the monarchs under<br>subjection,&#8212;and having gained imperishable wealth, the Suta's son<br>appeared before the king. Then, O represser of foes, entering into the<br>interior of the palace that hero saw Dhritarashtra with Gandhari, O tiger<br>among men, that one conversant with morality took hold of his feet even<br>like a son. And Dhritarashtra embraced him affectionately, and then<br>dismissed him. Ever since that time, O monarch, O Bharata, king<br>Duryodhana and Sakuni, the son of Suvala, thought that Pritha's sons had<br>already been defeated in battle by Karna."
