                            "Markandeya continued, 'O lord of men, the beautiful Siva endowed with<br>great virtues and an unspotted character was the wife of Angiras (one of<br>the seven Rishis). That excellent lady (Swaha) at first assuming the<br>disguise of Siva, sought the presence of Agni unto whom she said, 'O<br>Agni, I am tortured with love for thee. Do thou think it fit to woo me.<br>And if thou dost not accede to my request, know that I shall commit<br>self-destruction. I am Siva the wife of Angiras. I have come here<br>according to the advice of the wives of the other Rishis, who have sent<br>me here after due deliberation.'<br><br>Agni replied, 'How didst thou know that I was tortured with love and how<br>could the others, the beloved wives of the seven Rishis, of whom thou<br>hast spoken, know this?'<br><br>Swaha replied, 'Thou art always a favourite with us, but we are afraid of<br>thee. Now having read thy mind by well-known signs, they have sent to thy<br>presence. I have come here to gratify my desire. Be thou quick, O Agni,<br>to encompass the object of thy desire, my sisters-in-law are awaiting me.<br>I must return soon.'<br><br>Markandeya continued, 'Then Agni, filled with great joy and delight,<br>married Swaha in the guise of Siva, and that lady joyfully cohabiting<br>with him, held the semen virile in her hands. And then she thought within<br>herself that those who would observe her in that disguise in the forest,<br>would cast an unmerited slur upon the conduct of those Brahmana ladies in<br>connection with Agni. Therefore, to prevent this, she should assume the<br>disguise of a bird, and in that state she should more easily get out of<br>the forest.<br><br>Markandeya continued, 'Then assuming the disguise of a winged creature,<br>she went out of the forest and reached the White Mountain begirt with<br>clumps of heath and other plants and trees, and guarded by strange<br>seven-headed serpents with poison in their very looks, and abounding with<br>Rakshasas, male and female Pisachas, terrible spirits, and various kinds<br>of birds and animals. That excellent lady quickly ascending a peak of<br>those mountains, threw that semen into a golden lake. And then assuming<br>successively the forms of the wives of the high-souled seven Rishis, she<br>continued to dally with Agni. But on account of the great ascetic merit<br>of Arundhati and her devotion to her husband (Vasishtha), she was unable<br>to assume her form. And, O chief of Kuru's race, the lady Swaha on the<br>first lunar day threw six times into that lake the semen of Agni. And<br>thrown there, it produced a male child endowed with great power. And from<br>the fact of its being regarded by the Rishis as cast off, the child born<br>therefrom came to be called by the name of Skanda. And the child had six<br>faces, twelve ears, as many eyes, hands, and feet, one neck, and one<br>stomach. And it first assumed a form on the second lunar day, and it grew<br>to the size of a little child on the third. And the limbs of Guha were<br>developed on the fourth day. And being surrounded by masses of red clouds<br>flashing forth lightning, it shone like the Sun rising in the midst of a<br>mass of red clouds. And seizing the terrific and immense bow which was<br>used by the destroyer of the Asura Tripura for the destruction of the<br>enemies of the gods, that mighty being uttered such a terrible roar that<br>the three worlds with their mobile and immobile divisions became struck<br>with awe. And hearing that sound which seemed like the rumbling of a mass<br>of big clouds, the great Nagas, Chitra and Airavata, were shaken with<br>fear. And seeing them unsteady that lad shining with sun-like refulgence<br>held them with both his hands. And with a dart in (another) hand, and<br>with a stout, red-crested, big cock fast secured in another, that<br>long-armed son of Agni began to sport about making a terrible noise. And<br>holding an excellent conch-shell with two of his hands, that mighty being<br>began to blow it to the great terror of even the most powerful creatures.<br>And striking the air with two of his hands, and playing about on the<br>hill-top, the mighty Mahasena of unrivalled prowess, looked as if he were<br>on the point of devouring the three worlds, and shone like the bright<br>Sun-god at the moment of his ascension in the heavens. And that being of<br>wonderful prowess and matchless strength, seated on the top of that hill,<br>looked on with his numerous faces directed towards the different cardinal<br>points, and observing various things, he repeated his loud roars. And on<br>hearing those roars various creatures were prostrate with fear. And<br>frightened and troubled in mind they sought protection. And all those<br>persons of various orders who then sought the protection of that god are<br>known as his powerful Brahmana followers. And rising from his seat, that<br>mighty god allayed the fears of all those people, and then drawing his<br>bow, he discharged his arrows in the direction of the White Mountain. And<br>with those arrows the hill Krauncha, the son of Himavat, was rent<br>asunder. And that is the reason why swans and vultures now migrate to the<br>Sumeru mountains. The Krauncha hill, sorely wounded, fell down uttering<br>fearful groans. And seeing him fallen, the other hills too began to<br>scream. And that mighty being of unrivalled prowess, hearing the groans<br>of the afflicted, was not at all moved, but himself uplifting his mace,<br>yelled forth his war-whoop. And that high-souled being then hurled his<br>mace of great lustre and quickly rent in twain one of the peaks of the<br>White Mountain. And the White Mountain being thus pierced by him was<br>greatly afraid of him and dissociating himself from the earth fled with<br>the other mountains. And the earth was greatly afflicted and bereft of<br>her ornaments on all sides. And in this distress, she went over to Skanda<br>and once more shone with all her might. And the mountains too bowed down<br>to Skanda and came back and stuck into the earth. And all creatures then<br>celebrated the worship of Skanda on the fifth day of the lunar month.
