                            "Arjuna continued, 'Then, O Bharata, vehemently rushed at me in battle in<br>a body the Nivata-Kavachas, equipped with arms. And obstructing the<br>course of the car, and shouting loudly, those mighty charioteers, hemming<br>me in on all sides, covered me with showers of shafts. Then other demons<br>of mighty prowess, with darts and hatchets in their hands, began to throw<br>at me spears and axes. And that mighty discharge of darts, with numerous<br>maces and clubs incessantly hurled fell upon my car. And other dreadful<br>and grim-visaged smiters among the Nivata-Kavachas, furnished with bows<br>and sharpened weapons, ran at me in fight. And in the conflict, shooting<br>from the Gandiva sundry swift arrows coursing straight, I pierced each of<br>them with ten. And they were driven back by those stone-whetted shafts of<br>mine. Then on my steeds being swiftly driven by Matali, they began to<br>display various movements with the speed of the wind. And being skilfully<br>guided by Matali, they began to trample upon the sons of Diti. And<br>although the steeds yoked unto that mighty chariot numbered hundreds upon<br>hundreds, yet being deftly conducted by Matali, they began to move, as if<br>they were only a few. And by their tread, and by the rattling of the<br>chariot wheels and by the vollies of my shafts, the Danavas began to fall<br>by hundreds. And others accoutred in bows, being deprived of life, and<br>having their charioteers slain, were carried about by the horses. Then,<br>covering all sides and directions, all (the Danavas) skilled in striking<br>entered into the contest with various weapons, and thereat my mind became<br>afflicted. And I witnessed (this instance of) the marvellous prowess of<br>Matali, viz., that he guided those fiery steeds with ease. Then, O king,<br>in the conflict, with diverse fleet weapons I pierced by hundreds and by<br>thousands (demons) bearing arms. And, O slayer of foes, seeing me thus<br>range the field putting forth every exertion, the heroic charioteer of<br>Sakra was well-pleased. And oppressed by those steeds and that car, some<br>(of them) met with annihilation; and others desisted from fight; while<br>(other) Nivata-Kavachas, challenged by us in battle and being harassed<br>with shafts offered opposition unto me, by (discharging) mighty showers<br>of arrows. Thereupon, with hundreds and thousands of sundry fleet weapons<br>inspired with the mantras relating to Brahma's weapons, I swiftly began<br>to burn them. And being sore pressed by me, those mighty asuras waxing<br>wroth afflicted me together, by pouring torrents of clubs and darts and<br>swords. Then, O Bharata, I took up that favourite weapon of the lord of<br>the celestials, Maghavan by name, prime and of fiery energy and by the<br>energy of that weapon I cut into a thousand pieces the Tomaras, together<br>with the swords and the tridents hurled by them. And having cut off their<br>arms I in ire pierced them each with ten shafts. And in the field arrows<br>were shot from the Gandiva like unto rows of black-bees; and this Matali<br>admired. And their shafts also showered upon me; but those powerful<br>(arrows) I cut off with my shafts. Then on being struck the<br>Nivata-Kavachas again covered me on all sides with a mighty shower of<br>arrows. And having neutralised the force of the arrows by excellent swift<br>and flaming weapons capable of baffling arms, I pierced them by<br>thousands. And blood began to flow from their torn frames, even as in the<br>rainy season waters run down from the summits of mountains. And on being<br>wounded by my fleet and straight-coursing shafts of the touch of Indra's<br>thunder-bolt, they became greatly agitated. And their bodies were pierced<br>at hundreds of places; and the force of their arms diminished. Then the<br>Nivata-Kavachas fought me by (the help of) illusion.'"
