                            Vaisampayana said, "Having reached that spot, Bhimasena saw in the<br>vicinity of the Kailasa cliff, that beautiful lotus lake surrounded by<br>lovely woods, and guarded by the Rakshasas. And it sprang from the<br>cascades contiguous to the abode of Kuvera. And it was beautiful to<br>behold, and was furnished with a wide-spreading shade and abounded in<br>various trees and creepers and was covered with green lilies. And this<br>unearthly lake was filled with golden lotuses, and swarmed with diverse<br>species of birds. And its banks were beautiful and devoid of mud. And<br>situated on the rocky elevation this expanse of excellent water was<br>exceedingly fair. And it was the wonder of the world and healthful and of<br>romantic sight. In that lake the son of Kunti saw, the water of ambrosial<br>taste and cool and light and clear and fresh; and the Pandava drank of it<br>profusely. And that unearthly receptacle of waters was covered with<br>celestial Saugandhika lotuses, and was also spread over with beautiful<br>variegated golden lotuses of excellent fragrance having graceful stalks<br>of lapis lazulis. And swayed by swans and Karandavas, these lotuses were<br>scattering fresh farina. And this lake was the sporting region of the<br>high-souled Kuvera, the king of the Yakshas. And it was held in high<br>regard by the Gandharvas the Apsaras and the celestials. And it was<br>frequented by the celestial sages and the Yakshas and the Kimpurushas and<br>the Rakshasas and the Kinnaras; and it was well-protected by Kuvera. And<br>as soon as he beheld that river and that unearthly lake, Kunti's son,<br>Bhimasena of mighty strength became exceedingly delighted. And agreeably<br>to the mandate of their king, hundreds and thousands of Rakshasas, named<br>Krodhavasas, were guarding that lake, wearing uniforms and armed with<br>various weapons. And as that repressor of foes, Kunti's son, the heroic<br>Bhima of dreadful prowess, clad in deer-skins and wearing golden armlets<br>and equipped with weapons and girding his sword on, was fearlessly<br>proceeding, with the view of gathering the lotus, those (Rakshasas) saw<br>him and immediately began to address each other, shouting forth, 'It<br>behoveth you to enquire for the errand on which this foremost of men,<br>clad in deer skins, and equipped with arms, hath come.' Then they all<br>approached the effulgent Vrikodara of mighty arms and asked, 'Who art<br>thou? Thou shouldst answer our questions. We see thee in the guise of an<br>ascetic and yet armed with weapons. O thou of mighty intelligence, do<br>thou unfold unto us the object with which thou hast come (hither)."
