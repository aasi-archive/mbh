                            (Ghosha-yatra Parva)<br><br>Janamejaya said, "While those foremost of men&#8212;the sons of Pritha&#8212;were<br>passing their days in the forest exposed to the inclemencies of the<br>winter, the summer, the wind and the sun, what did they do, O Brahmana,<br>after they had reached the lake and woods going by the name of Dwaita?"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "After the sons of Pandu had arrived at that lake,<br>they chose a residence that was removed from the habitations of men. And<br>they began to roam through delightful woods and ever charming mountains<br>and picturesque river-valleys. And after they had taken up their<br>residence there, many venerable ascetics endued with Vedic lore often<br>came to see them. And those foremost of men always received those<br>Veda-knowing Rishis with great respect. And one day there came unto the<br>Kaurava princes a certain Brahmana who was well known on earth for his<br>powers of speech. And having conversed with the Pandavas for a while, he<br>went away as pleased him to the court of the royal son of Vichitravirya.<br>Received with respect by that chief of the Kurus, the old king, the<br>Brahmana took his seat; and asked by the monarch he began to talk of the<br>sons of Dharma, Pavana, Indra and of the twins, all of whom having fallen<br>into severe misery, had become emaciated and reduced owing to exposure to<br>wind and sun. And that Brahmana also talked of Krishna who was<br>overwhelmed with suffering and who then had become perfectly helpless,<br>although she had heroes for her lords. And hearing the words of that<br>Brahmana, the royal son of Vichitravirya became afflicted with grief, at<br>the thought of those princes of royal lineage then swimming in a river of<br>sorrow. His inmost soul afflicted with sorrow and trembling all over with<br>sighs, he quieted himself with a great effort, remembering that<br>everything had arisen from his own fault. And the monarch said, 'Alas,<br>how is it that Yudhishthira who is the eldest of my sons, who is truthful<br>and pious and virtuous in his behaviour, who hath not a foe, who had<br>formerly slept on beds made of soft Ranku skins, sleepeth now on the bare<br>ground! Alas, wakened formerly by Sutas and Magadhas and other singers<br>with his praises, melodiously recited every morning, that prince of the<br>Kuru race, equal unto Indra himself, is now waked from the bare ground<br>towards the small hours of the night by a multitude of birds! How doth<br>Vrikodara, reduced by exposure to wind and sun and filled with wrath,<br>sleep, in the presence of the princess of Panchala, on the bare ground,<br>unfit as he is to suffer such lot! Perhaps also, the intelligent Arjuna,<br>who is incapable of bearing pain, and who, though obedient to the will of<br>Yudhishthira, yet feeleth himself to be pierced over all by the<br>remembrance of his wrongs, sleepeth not in the night! Beholding the twins<br>and Krishna and Yudhisthira and Bhima plunged in misery, Arjuna without<br>doubt, sigheth like a serpent of fierce energy and sleepeth not from<br>wrath in the night! The twins also, who are even like a couple of blessed<br>celestials in heaven sunk in woe though deserving of bliss, without doubt<br>pass their nights in restless wakefulness restrained (from avenging their<br>wrongs) by virtue and truth! The mighty son of the Wind-god, who is equal<br>to the Wind-god himself in strength, without doubt, sigheth and<br>restraineth his wrath, being tied through his elder brother in the bonds<br>of truth! Superior in battle to all warriors, he now lieth quiet on the<br>ground, restrained by virtue and truth, and burning to slay my children,<br>he bideth his time. The cruel words that Dussasana spoke after<br>Yudhishthira had been deceitfully defeated at dice, have sunk deep into<br>Vrikodara's heart, and are consuming him, like a burning bundle of straw<br>consuming a fagot of dry wood! The son of Dharma never acteth sinfully;<br>Dhananjaya also always obeyeth him; but Bhima's wrath, in consequence of<br>a life of exile, is increasing like a conflagration assisted by the wind!<br>That hero, burning with rage such as that, squeezeth his hands and<br>breatheth hot and fierce sighs, as if consuming therewith my sons and<br>grandsons! The wielder of the Gandiva and Vrikodara, when angry, are like<br>Yama and Kala themselves; scattering their shafts, which are like unto<br>thunder-bolts, they exterminate in battle the ranks of the enemy. Alas<br>Duryodhana, and Sakuni, and the Suta's son, and Dussasana also of wicked<br>soul, in robbing the Pandavas of their kingdom by means of dice, seem to<br>behold the honey alone without marking the terrible ruin. A man having<br>acted rightly or wrongly, expecteth the fruit of those acts. The fruit,<br>however, confounding him, paralyses him fully. How can man, thereof, have<br>salvation? If the soil is properly tilled, and the seed sown therein, and<br>if the god (of rain) showereth in season, still the crop may not grow.<br>This is what we often hear. Indeed, how could this saying be true unless,<br>as I think, it be that everything here is dependent on Destiny? The<br>gambler Sakuni hath behaved deceitfully towards the son of Pandu, who<br>ever acteth honestly. From affection for my wicked sons I also have acted<br>similarly. Alas, it is owing to this that the hour of destruction hath<br>come for the Kurus! Oh, perhaps, what is inevitable must happen! The<br>wind, impelled or not, will move. The woman that conceives will bring<br>forth. Darkness will be dispelled at dawn, and day disappear at evening!<br>Whatever may be earned by us or others, whether people spend it or not,<br>when the time cometh, those possessions of ours do bring on misery. Why<br>then do people become so anxious about earning wealth? If, indeed, what<br>is acquired is the result of fate, then should it be protected so that it<br>may not be divided, nor lost little by little, nor permitted to flow out<br>at once, for if unprotected, it may break into a hundred fragments. But<br>whatever the character of our possessions, our acts in the world are<br>never lost. Behold what the energy of Arjuna is, who went into the abode<br>of Indra from the woods! Having mastered the four kinds of celestial<br>weapons he hath come back into this world! What man is there who, having<br>gone to heaven in his human form, wisheth to come back? This would never<br>have been but because he seeth innumerable Kurus to be at the point of<br>death, afflicted by Time! The bowman is Arjuna, capable of wielding the<br>bow with his left hand as well! The bow he wieldeth is the Gandiva of<br>fierce impetus. He hath, besides, those celestial weapons of his! Who is<br>there that would bear the energy of these three!"<br><br>"Hearing these words of the monarch, the son of Suvala, going unto<br>Duryodhana, who was then sitting with Kama, told them everything in<br>private. And Duryodhana, though possessed of little sense, was filled<br>with grief at what he heard."
