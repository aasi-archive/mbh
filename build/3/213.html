                            "Markandeya said, 'When, O Yudhishthira, all this mystery of salvation<br>was explained to that Brahmana, he was highly pleased and he said<br>addressing the fowler, 'All this that thou hast explained, is rational,<br>and it seems to me that there is nothing in connection with the mysteries<br>of religion which thou dost not know.' The fowler replied, 'O good and<br>great Brahmana, thou shalt perceive with thine own eyes, all the virtue<br>that I lay claim to, and by reason of which I have attained this blissful<br>state. Rise, worshipful sir, and quickly enter this inner apartment. O<br>virtuous man, it is proper that thou shouldst see my father and my<br>mother.' Markandeya continued, 'Thus addressed the Brahmana went in, and<br>beheld a fine beautiful mansion. It was a magnificent house divided in<br>four suites of rooms, admired by gods and looking like one of their<br>palaces; it was also furnished with seats and beds, and redolent of<br>excellent perfumes. His revered parents clad in white robes, having<br>finished their meals, were seated at ease. The fowler, beholding them,<br>prostrated himself before them with his head at their feet. His aged<br>parents then addressed him thus, 'Rise, O man of piety, rise, may<br>righteousness shield thee; we are much pleased with thee for thy piety;<br>mayst thou be blessed with a long life, and with knowledge, high<br>intelligence, and fulfilment of thy desires. Thou art a good and dutiful<br>son, for, we are constantly and reasonably looked after by thee, and even<br>amongst the celestials thou hast not another divinity to worship. By<br>constantly subduing thyself, thou hast become endowed with the<br>self-restraining power of Brahmanas and all thy grandsires and ancestors<br>are constantly pleased with thee for thy self-restraining virtues and for<br>thy piety towards us. In thought, word or deed thy attention to us never<br>flags, and it seems that at present thou hast no other thought in thy<br>mind (save as to how to please us). As Rama, the son of Jamadagni,<br>laboured to please his aged parents, so hast thou, O Son, done to please<br>us, and even more. Then the fowler introduced the Brahmana to his parents<br>and they received him with the usual salutation of welcome, and the<br>Brahmana accepting their welcome, enquired if they, with their children<br>and servants, were all right at home, and if they were always enjoying<br>good health at that time (of life). The aged couple replied, 'At home, O<br>Brahmana, we are all right, with all our servants. Hast thou, adorable<br>sir, reached this place without any difficulty?' Markandeya continued,<br>"The Brahmana replied, 'Yes, I have.' Then the fowler addressing himself<br>to the Brahmana said to him, 'These my parents, worshipful sir, are the<br>idols that I worship; whatever is due to the gods, I do unto them. As the<br>thirty-three gods with Indra at their head are worshipped by men, so are<br>these aged parents of mine worshipped by me. As Brahmanas exert<br>themselves for the purpose of procuring offering for their gods, so do I<br>act with diligence for these two (idols of mine). These my father and<br>mother, O Brahmana, are my supreme gods, and I seek to please them always<br>with offering of flowers, fruits and gems. To me they are like the three<br>sacred fires mentioned by the learned; and, O Brahmana, they seem to me<br>to be as good as sacrifices or the four Vedas. My five life-giving airs,<br>my wife and children and friends are all for them (dedicated to their<br>service). And with my wife and children I always attend on them. O good<br>Brahmana, with my own hands I assist them in bathing and also wash their<br>feet and give them food and I say to them only what is agreeable, leaving<br>out what is unpleasant. I consider it to be my highest duty to do what is<br>agreeable to them even though it be not strictly justifiable. And, O<br>Brahmana, I am always diligent in attending on them. The two parents, the<br>sacred fire, the soul and the spiritual preceptor, these five, O good<br>Brahmana, are worthy of the highest reverence from a person who seeks<br>prosperity. By serving them properly, one acquires the merit of<br>perpetually keeping up the sacred fire. And it is the eternal and<br>invariable duty of all householders."
