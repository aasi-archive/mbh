                            "Lomasa said, 'Then gathered together, Brahma, the grandfather of men<br>(thus) addressed, 'Go ye, O gods! whither your pleasure may lead you, or<br>your desire conduct you. It will take a long course of time for the ocean<br>to resume its wonted state; the occasion will be furnished by the agnates<br>of the great king Bhagiratha.' Hearing the words of the (universal)<br>grandfather (Brahma), all the foremost gods went their way biding the day<br>(when the ocean was to be filled again).'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'What was that occasion, O Saint? And how did the<br>agnates of (Bhagiratha furnish the same)? And how was the ocean refilled<br>by the interference of Bhagiratha? O Saint, who deemest thy religious<br>practices as thy only treasure. O thou of the priestly class! I wish to<br>hear the account of the achievements of the king, narrated in detail by<br>thyself.'"<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, "Thus addressed by the magnanimous and virtuous king,<br>he, the chief of men of the priestly class, narrated the achievements of<br>the high-souled (king) Sagara."<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'There was born in the family of the Ikshaku tribe, a ruler<br>of the earth named Sagara, endued with beauty, and strength. And that<br>same (king) of a dreaded name was sonless, O descendant of Bharata! And<br>he carried havoc through the tribes of the Haihayas and the Talajanghas;<br>brought under subjection the whole of the military caste; (and so) ruled<br>over his own kingdom. And, O most praiseworthy of the descendants of<br>Bharata! O chief of the Bharata race! he had two wives proud of their<br>beauty and of their youth,&#8212;one a princess of the Vidarbha race, and the<br>other of the royal line of Sivi. And, O chief of kings, that same ruler<br>of men, betook himself to the mountain Kailasa, accompanied by both his<br>wives, and with the desire of having a son became engaged in the practice<br>of exceeding austere penances. And being engaged in the practice of rigid<br>austerities, and (also) employed in the contemplation known by the name<br>of Yoga, he obtained the sight of the magnanimous god with three<br>eyes&#8212;the slayer of the demon called Tripura; the worker of blessings<br>(for all beings); the (eternally) existent one; the ruling Being, the<br>holder of the Pinaka bow; carrying in his hand his (well-known<br>weapon)&#8212;the trident; the god of three eyes; the repository of (eternal)<br>peace; the ruler of all those that are fierce; capable of assuming very<br>many forms; and the lord of the goddess Uma. And that same ruler of men,<br>of mighty arms, as soon as he beheld the god&#8212;that giver of boons&#8212;fell<br>down at his feet, with both his queens, and proffered a prayer to have a<br>son. And the god Siva, well pleased with him, spake (thus) to that most<br>righteous of the rulers of men, attended by his two wives, saying, 'O<br>lord of men! considering the (astrological) moment at which thou hast<br>proffered thy prayer to me, sixty thousand sons, O foremost of choice men<br>valorous and characterised by exceeding pride, will be born in one off<br>thy two wives (here). But they all, O ruler of the earth, shall perish<br>together. In the other wife, (however), will be born a single valiant<br>son, who will perpetuate thy race.' Having said this to him, the god<br>Rudra (Siva) vanished from sight at that very spot, and that same king<br>Sagara now came (back) to his own abode accompanied by his two wives,<br>exceedingly delighted at heart (for what had happened) then. And, O most<br>praiseworthy of the sons of Manu! (i.e., men), there the two lotus-eyed<br>wives of him&#8212;the princess of Vidarbha and the princess of Sivi&#8212;came<br>(erelong) to be with child. And afterwards, on the due day, the princess<br>of Vidarbha brought forth (something) of the shape of a gourd and the<br>princess of Sivi gave birth to a boy as beautiful as a god. Then the<br>ruler of the earth made up his mind to throw away the gourd,&#8212;when he<br>heard (proceeding) from the sky a speech (uttered) in a grave and solemn<br>voice, 'O king! do thou not be guilty of this hasty act; thou shouldst<br>not abandon thy sons. Take out the seeds from the gourd and let them be<br>preserved with care in steaming vessels partly filled with clarified<br>butter. Then thou wilt get, O scion of Bharata's race! sixty thousand<br>sons. O ruler of men! the great god (Siva) hath spoken that thy sons are<br>to be born in this manner. Let not therefore thy mind be turned away<br>therefrom.'"
