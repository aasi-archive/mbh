                            "Vasudeva said, 'When Salwa had left the city of the Anarttas, I returned<br>to it, O king, on the completion of thy great Rajasuya sacrifice! On my<br>arrival I found Dwaraka shorn of its splendour, and, O great monarch,<br>there were not sounds of Vedic recitation or sacrificial offering, And<br>the excellent damsels were all destitute of ornaments, and the gardens<br>were devoid of beauty. And alarmed by the aspect, I asked the son of<br>Hridika saying, 'Why is it that the men and women of the city of the<br>Vrishnis are so woe-begone, O tiger among men?' O thou best of kings thus<br>asked the son of Hridika (Kritavarman) relate to me in detail the<br>invasion of the city by Salwa, and his subsequent departure from it. And,<br>O thou foremost of Bharatas, hearing all, even then I made up my mind to<br>slay Salwa. And encouraging the citizens, O best of Bharatas, I<br>cheerfully addressed king Ahuka, and Anakdundhuvi, and the chief heroes<br>of the Vrishni race, saying, 'Do ye, O bulls among the Yadavas, stay in<br>the city, taking every care, and know that I go to slay Salwa! I return<br>not to the city of Dwaravati without slaying him. I will again come to ye<br>having compassed the destruction of Salwa together with his car of<br>precious metals. Do ye strike up the sharp and middle and flat notes of<br>the Dundhuvi so dreadful to foes!' And O thou bull of the Bharata race,<br>thus adequately encouraged by me, those heroes cheerfully said unto me,<br>'Go and slay the enemies!' And thus receiving the benedictions of those<br>warriors with glad hearts, and causing the Brahmanas to utter auspicious<br>words and bowing down to the best of the regenerate ones, and to Siva<br>also, I set out on my car unto which were yoked the horses Saivya, and<br>Sugriva, filling all sides with the clatter (of my wheels) and blowing<br>that best of conchs, the Panchajanya! And, O king, O tiger among men,<br>accompanied by my redoubted and victorious army consisting of the four<br>kinds of the forces so persevering in battle, I set out. And leaving many<br>countries, and mountains, crowned with trees, and pieces of water, and<br>streams, I at last arrived at the country of Matrikavarta. It is there, O<br>thou tiger among men, that I heard that Salwa was coursing on his car of<br>precious metals near the ocean, and I followed in his pursuit. And, O<br>thou slayer of thy foes, having reached the main, Salwa on his car of<br>costly metals was in the midst of the deep heaving with billows! And on<br>seeing me from a distance, O Yudhishthira, that one of wicked soul<br>himself challenged me repeatedly to the fight. And many arrows capable of<br>piercing to the quick, discharged from my bow reached not his car. And at<br>this I was wroth! And, O king, that essentially sinful wretch of a<br>Daitya's son of irrepressible energy, on his part began to shoot thousand<br>upon thousands of arrows in torrents! And, O Bharata, he rained shafts<br>upon my soldiers and upon my charioteer and upon my steeds! But without<br>thinking of the shafts, we continued the conflict. Then the warriors<br>following Salwa poured on me straight arrows by thousands. And the Asuras<br>covered my horses and my car and Daruka with arrows capable of piercing<br>the very vitals. And, O hero, I could not at that time see either my<br>horses, or my car, or my charioteer Daruka! And I with my army was<br>covered with weapons. And, O son of Kunti, superhumanly skilled in<br>weapons, I also let fly from my bow arrows by tens of thousands,<br>inspiring them with mantras! But as that car of costly metals was in the<br>sky, full two miles off, it could not, O Bharata, be seen by my troops.<br>They could therefore only remaining on the field of battle look on like<br>spectators in a place of amusement, cheering me on by shouts loud as the<br>roar of the lion, and also by the sound of their clapping. And the tinted<br>arrows shot by the fore-part of hand penetrated into the bodies of the<br>Danavas like biting insects. And then arose cries in the car of precious<br>metals from those that were dying of wounds by those sharp arrows and<br>falling into the waters of the mighty ocean. And the Danavas deprived of<br>their arms, necks, and wearing the form of Kavandhas,&#8212;fell, sending up<br>tremendous roars. And as they fell they were devoured by animals living<br>in the waters of the ocean. And then I powerfully blew the Panchajanya<br>obtained from the waters and graceful as the lotus-stalk and white as<br>milk or the Kunda flower or the moon or silver. And seeing his soldiers<br>fall, Salwa the possessor of the car of precious metals, began to fight<br>with the help of illusion. And then he began to ceaselessly hurl at me<br>maces, and ploughshares, and winged darts and lances, and javelins, and<br>battle-axes, and swords and arrows blazing like javelins and<br>thunderbolts, and nooses, and broad swords, and bullets from barrels, and<br>shafts, and axes, and rockets. And permitting them to come towards me, I<br>soon destroyed them all by counter-illusion. And on this illusion being<br>rendered ineffectual, he began the contest with mountain peaks. And, O<br>Bharata, then there was darkness and light alternately, and the day was<br>now fair, and now gloomy, and now hot, and now cold. And there was a<br>perfect shower of coals, and ashes, and weapons. And creating such<br>illusion the enemy fought with me. And ascertaining it I destroyed his<br>illusion by counter-illusion. And in the due time I showered arrows all<br>round. And then, O mighty king, the dome of heaven blazed as with a<br>hundred suns, and, O son of Kunti with one hundred moons, and thousands<br>and ten thousands of stars! And then none could ascertain whether it was<br>day or night, or distinguish the points of the horizon. And, becoming<br>bewildered, I fixed on my bowstring the weapon called Pragnastra. And, O<br>son of Kunti, the weapon went like unto flakes of pure cotton blown away<br>by the winds! And a great fight took place, calculated to make the down<br>on one's body stand on end. And O best of monarchs, having regained,<br>light, I again fought with the enemy!'"
