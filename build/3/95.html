                            Vaisampayana said, "The heroic sons of Pandu, accompanied by their<br>followers, proceeding from place to place, at last arrived at Naimisha. O<br>king, reaching the Gomati, the Pandavas bathed in the sacred tirtha of<br>that stream, and having performed their ablutions there, they gave away,<br>O Bharata, both kine and wealth! And repeatedly offering oblations of<br>water, O Bharata, to the gods, the pitris, and the Brahmanas, in the<br>tirthas called Kanya, Aswa, and Go and staying (as directed) in Kalakoti<br>and the Vishaprastha hills, the Kauravas then, O king, reached Vahuda and<br>performed their ablution in that stream. Proceeding next, O lord of<br>earth, to the sacrificial region of the gods known by the name Prayaga,<br>they bathed in the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna and residing there<br>practised ascetic penances of great merit. And the Pandavas, of truthful<br>promises, bathing in the tirtha, cleansed themselves of every sin. The<br>sons of Pandu then, O king of the Bharata race, accompanied by those<br>Brahmanas, proceeded to the tirtha called Vedi, sacred to the Creator and<br>adored by the ascetics. Residing there for some time and gratifying the<br>Brahmanas with the fruit and roots of the wilderness and clarified<br>butter, those heroes began to practise ascetic penances of great merit.<br>They then proceeded to Mahidhara consecrated by that virtuous royal sage<br>Gaya of unrivalled splendour. In that region is the hill called Gayasira,<br>as well as the delightful river called Mahanadi, with fine banks graced<br>by bushes of canes. On that celestial hill of holy peaks is a sacred<br>tirtha called Brahmasara  which is much adored by ascetics. There on the<br>banks of that lake had dwelt of yore the eternal god himself of justice,<br>and it was thither that the illustrious Rishi Agastya had repaired to<br>behold that deity. It is from that lake that all the rivers take their<br>rise and there in that tirtha, Mahadeva the wielder of the Pinaka, is<br>present for aye. Arriving at that spot, the heroic sons of Pandu<br>practised the vow that is known by the name of the Chaturmasya according<br>to all the rites and ordinances of the great sacrifice called Rishiyajna.<br>It is there that that mighty tree called the Eternal banian stands. Any<br>sacrifice performed there produces merit that is eternal. In that<br>sacrificial platform of the gods producing eternal merit, the Pandavas<br>began to fast with concentrated souls. And there came unto them Brahmanas<br>by hundreds endued with wealth of asceticism. And those Brahmanas also<br>all performed the Chaturmasya sacrifice according to the rites inculcated<br>by the Rishis. And there in that tirtha, those Brahmanas old in knowledge<br>and ascetic merit and fully versed in the Vedas, that constituted the<br>court of the illustrious sons of Pandu, talked in their presence upon<br>various subject of sacred import. And it was in that place that the<br>learned vow-observing, and sacred Shamatha, leading, besides, a life of<br>celibacy, spake unto them, O king, of Gaya, the son of Amurttaraya. And<br>Shamatha said, 'Gaya, the son of Amurttaraya, was one of the foremost of<br>royal sages. Listen to me, O Bharata, as I recite his meritorious deeds.<br>It was here, O king, that Gaya had performed many sacrifices<br>distinguished by the enormous quantities of food (that were distributed)<br>and the profuse gifts that were given away (unto Brahmanas). Those<br>sacrifices, O king, were distinguished by mountains in hundreds and<br>thousands of cooked rice, lakes of clarified butter and rivers of curds<br>in many hundreds, and streams of richly-dressed curries in thousands. Day<br>after day were these got ready and distributed amongst all comers, while,<br>over and above this, Brahmanas and others, O king, received food that was<br>clean and pure. During the conclusion also (of every sacrifice) when<br>gifts were dedicated to the Brahmanas, the chanting of the Vedas reached<br>the heavens. And so loud, indeed, was the sound of the Vedic Mantras that<br>nothing else, O Bharata, could be heard there. Thus sacred sounds, O<br>king, filled the earth, the points of the horizon, the sky and heaven<br>itself. Even these were the wonders that persons noticed on those<br>occasions. And gratified with the excellent viands and drinks that the<br>illustrious Gaya provided, men, O bull of the Bharata race, went about<br>singing these verses. In Gaya's great sacrifice, who is there today,<br>amongst creatures, that still desireth to eat? There are yet twenty-five<br>mountains of food there after all have been fed! What the royal sage Gaya<br>of immense splendour hath achieved in his sacrifice was never achieved by<br>men before, nor will be by any in future. The gods have been so surfeited<br>by Gaya with clarified butter that they are not able to take anything<br>that anybody else may offer. As sand grains on earth, as stars in the<br>firmament, as drops showered by rain-charged clouds, cannot ever be<br>counted by anybody, so can none count the gifts in Gaya's sacrifice!"<br><br>"O son of the Kuru race, many times did king Gaya perform sacrifices of<br>this description, here, by the side of this Brahmasara!"
