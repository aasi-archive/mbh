                            'Rishyasringa said, 'Here came to-day a religious student with a mass of<br>hair on his head. And he was neither short nor tall. And he was of a<br>spirited look and a golden complexion, and endued with eye large as<br>lotuses; and he was shining and graceful as a god. And rich was his<br>beauty blazing like the Sun; and he was exceedingly fair with eyes<br>graceful and black. And his twisted hair was blue-black and neat and long<br>and of a fragrant scent and tied up with strings of gold. A beautiful<br>ornament was shining on his neck which looked like lightning in the sky.<br>And under the throat he had two balls of flesh without a single hair upon<br>them and of an exceedingly beautiful form. And his waist was slender to a<br>degree and his navel neat; and smooth also was the region about his ribs.<br>Then again there shone a golden string from under his cloth, just like<br>this waist-string of mine. And there was something on his feet of a<br>wonderful shape which give forth a jingling sound. Upon his wrists<br>likewise was tied a pair of ornaments that made a similar sound and<br>looked just like this rosary here. And when he walked, his ornaments<br>uttered a jingling sound like those uttered by delighted ganders upon a<br>sheet of water. And he had on his person garments of a wonderful make;<br>these clothes of mine are by no means beautiful like those. And his face<br>was wonderful to behold; and his voice was calculated to gladden the<br>heart; and his speech was pleasant like the song of the male blackbird.<br>And while listening to the same I felt touched to my inmost soul. And as<br>a forest in the midst of the vernal season, assumes a grace only when it<br>is swept over by the breeze, so, O father! he of an excellent and pure<br>smell looks beautiful when fanned by the air. And his mass of hair is<br>neatly tied up and remains adhering to the head and forehead evenly<br>sundered in two. And his two eyes seemed to be covered with wonderful<br>Chakravaka birds of an exceedingly beautiful form. And he carried upon<br>his right palm a wonderful globur fruit, which reaches the ground and<br>again and again leaps up to the sky in a strange way. And he beats it and<br>turns himself round and whirls like a tree moved by the breeze. And when<br>I looked at him, O father! he seemed to be a son of the celestials, and<br>my joy was extreme, and my pleasure unbounded. And he clasped my body,<br>took hold of my matted hair, and bent down my mouth, and, mingling his<br>mouth with my own, uttered a sound that was exceedingly pleasant. And he<br>doth not care for water for washing his feet, nor for those fruits<br>offered by me; and he told me that such was the religious observance<br>practised by him. And he gave unto me a number of fruits. Those fruits<br>were tasteful unto me: these here are not equal to them in taste. They<br>have not got any rind nor any stone within them, like these. And he of a<br>noble form gave me to drink water of an exceedingly fine flavour; and<br>having drunk it, I experienced great pleasu e; and the ground seemed to<br>be moving under my feet. And these are the garlands beautiful and<br>fragrant and twined with silken threads that belong to him. And he,<br>bright with fervent piety, having scattered these garlands here, went<br>back to his own hermitage. His departure hath saddened my heart; and my<br>frame seems to be in a burning sensation! And my desire is to go to him<br>as soon as I can, and to have him every day walk about here. O father,<br>let me this very moment go to him. Pray, what is that religious<br>observance which is being practised by him. As he of a noble piety is<br>practising penances, so I am desirous to live the same life with him. My<br>heart is yearning after similar observances My soul will be in torment if<br>I see him not,'"
