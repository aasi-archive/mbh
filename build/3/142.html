                            Vaisampayana said, "O king, then those foremost of bowmen, of<br>immeasurable prowess, holding bows stringed at full stretch and equipped<br>with quivers and arrows and wearing finger-caps made of the guana-skin,<br>and with their swords on, proceeded with Panchali towards the<br>Gandhamadana, taking with them the best of Brahmanas. And on their way<br>they saw various lakes, and rivers and mountains and forests, and trees<br>of wide-spreading shade on mountain summits and places abounding in trees<br>bearing flowers and fruit in all seasons and frequented by celestials and<br>sages. And restraining their senses within their inner self and<br>subsisting on fruits and roots, the heroes passed through rugged regions,<br>craggy and difficult of passage, beholding many and various kinds of<br>beasts. Thus those high-souled ones entered the mountain inhabited by the<br>sages, the Siddhas and the celestials, and frequented by the Kinnaras and<br>the Apsaras. And, O lord of men, as those mighty heroes were entering the<br>mountain Gandhamandana, there arose a violent wind, attended with a heavy<br>shower. And owing to this, mighty clouds of dust bearing lots of dry<br>leaves, rose, and all on a sudden covered earth, air and firmament. And<br>when the heavens had been covered with dust nothing could be perceived,<br>neither could they (the Pandavas) speak to one another. And with eyes<br>enveloped with darkness and pushed by the wind carrying particles of<br>rocks they could not see one another. And there began to arrive mighty<br>sounds proceeding from the tree, and also from those breaking down<br>incessantly under the force of the wind, and falling to the ground. And<br>distracted by gusts of the wind, they thought, 'Are the heavens falling<br>down; or the earth and the mountains being rent?' And afraid of the wind,<br>they felt about with their hands and took shelter under the way-side tree<br>and ant-hills and in caverns. Then holding his bow and supporting Krishna<br>the mighty Bhimasena stood under a tree. And Yudhishthira the just with<br>Dhaumya crept into the deep wood. And Sahedeva carrying the sacred fire<br>with him took shelter in a rock. And Nakula together with Lomasa and<br>other Brahmanas of great asceticism stood in fright, each under a tree.<br>Then when the wind had abated and the dust subsided, there came down a<br>shower in torrents. There also arose a loud rattling noise, like unto the<br>thunder hurled; and quick-flashing lightning began to play gracefully<br>upon the clouds. And being helped on by the swift wind, showers of rain<br>poured down without intermissions, filling all sides round. And, O lord<br>of men, all around there began to flow many rivers covered with foam and<br>turbid with mud; and these bearing volumes of water spread over the<br>frothy rafts rushed down with tremendous roar uprooting trees. And<br>afterwards when that sound had ceased and the air had arisen they (each<br>of them) cautiously came out of their coverts and met together, O<br>descendant of Bharata. And then the heroes started for the mountain<br>Gandhamadana."
