                            Janamejaya said, "These feats of Pritha's son endued with immeasurable<br>energy, were certainly marvellous. O Brahmana, what did Dhritarashtra of<br>great wisdom say, when he heard of them?"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Amvika's son, king Dhritarashtra, having heard of<br>Arjuna's arrival and stay at Indra's abode, from Dwaipayana, that<br>foremost of Rishis, spake unto Sanjaya, saying, 'O charioteer, dost thou<br>know in detail the acts of the intelligent Arjuna, of which I have heard<br>from beginning to end? O charioteer, my wretched and sinful son is even<br>now engaged in a policy of the most vulgar kind. Of wicked soul, he will<br>certainly depopulate the earth. The illustrious person whose words even<br>in jest are true, and who hath Dhananjaya to fight for him, is sure to<br>win the three worlds. Who that is even beyond the influence of Death and<br>Decay will be able to stay before Arjuna, when he will scatter his barbed<br>and sharp-pointed arrows whetted on stone? My wretched sons, who have to<br>fight with the invincible Pandavas are indeed, all doomed. Reflecting day<br>and night, I see not the warrior amongst us that is able to stay in<br>battle before the wielder of the Gandiva. If Drona, or Karna, or even<br>Bhishma advance against him in battle, a great calamity is likely to<br>befall the earth. But even in that case, I see not the way to our success<br>Karna is kind and forgetful. The preceptor Drona is old, and the teacher<br>(of Arjuna) Arjuna, however, is wrathful, and strong, and proud, and of<br>firm and steady prowess. As all these warriors are invincible, a terrible<br>fight will take place between them. All of them are heroes skilled in<br>weapons and of great reputation. They would not wish for the sovereignty<br>of the world, if it was to be purchased by defeat. Indeed, peace will be<br>restored only on the death of these or of Phalguna. The slayer of Arjuna,<br>however, existeth not, nor doth one that can vanquish him. Oh, how shall<br>that wrath of his which hath myself for its object be pacified. Equal<br>unto the chief of the celestials, that hero gratified Agni at Khandava<br>and vanquished all the monarchs of the earth on the occasion of the great<br>Rajasuya. O Sanjaya, the thunder-bolt falling on the mountain top,<br>leaveth a portion unconsumed; but the shafts, O child, that are shot by<br>Kiriti leave not a rack behind. As the rays of the sun heat this mobile<br>and immobile universe, so will the shafts shot by Arjuna's hands scorch<br>my sons. It seemeth to me that the Chamus of the Bharatas, terrified at<br>the clatter of Arjuna's chariot-wheels, are already broken through in all<br>directions. Vidhatri hath created Arjuna as an all-consuming Destroyer.<br>He stayeth in battle as a foe, vomitting and scattering swarms of arrows.<br>Who is there that will defeat him?"
