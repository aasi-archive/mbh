                            "Lomasa said, 'The Kalakeyas then having recourse to that receptacle of<br>waters, which is the abode of Varuna, began their operations for the<br>destruction of the universe. And during the darkness of the night those<br>angry Daityas began to devour the Munis they found in woody retreats and<br>sacred spots. And those wicked wretches devoured in the asylum of<br>Vasishtha, Brahmanas to the number of a hundred and eighty, besides nine<br>other ascetics. And, proceeding to the asylum of Chyavana that was<br>inhabited by many Brahmacharis, they devoured a century of Brahmanas that<br>lived upon fruit and roots alone. And they began to do all this during<br>the darkness of the night, while they entered the depths of the sea by<br>day. And they slew a full score of Brahmanas of subdued souls and leading<br>a Brahmacharya mode of life and living upon air and water alone, in the<br>retreat of Bharadwaja. And it was thus that those Danavas the Kalakeyas,<br>intoxicated with prowess of arms and their lives nearly run out,<br>gradually invaded all the asylums of the Rishis during the darkness of<br>the night, slaughtering numerous Brahmanas. And, O best of men, although<br>the Danavas behaved in this way towards the ascetics in woody retreats,<br>yet men failed to discover anything of them. And every morning people saw<br>the dead bodies of Munis emaciated with frugal diet, lying on the ground.<br>And many of those bodies were without flesh and without blood, without<br>marrow, without entrails, and with limbs separated from one another. And<br>here and there lay on the ground heaps of bones like masses of conch<br>shells. And the earth was scattered over with the (sacrificial) contents<br>of broken jars and shattered ladles for pouring libations of clarified<br>butter and with the sacred fires kept with care by the ascetics. And the<br>universe afflicted with the terror of the Kalakeyas, being destitute of<br>Vedic studies and vashats and sacrificial festivals and religious rites,<br>became entirely cheerless. And, O king, when men began to perish in this<br>way, the survivors, afflicted with fear, fled for their lives in all<br>directions. And some fled to caverns and some behind mountain-streams and<br>springs and some through fear of death, died without much ado. And some<br>who were brave and mighty bowmen cheerfully went out and took great<br>trouble in tracking the Danavas. Unable, however, to find them out, for<br>the Asuras had sought refuge in the depths of the sea, these brave men<br>came back to their homes gratified with the search. And, O lord of men,<br>when the universe was being thus destroyed, and when sacrificial<br>festivals and religious rites had been suspended, the gods became deeply<br>afflicted. And gathering together with Indra in their midst they began,<br>from fear, to take counsel of one another. And repairing unto the exalted<br>and uncreate Narayana&#8212;that unvanquished god of Vaikuntha&#8212;the celestials<br>sought his protection. And bowing unto the slayer of Madhu, the gods<br>addressed him, saying, 'O lord, thou art the creator, the protector, and<br>the slayer of ourselves as well as of the universe. It is thou who has<br>created this universe with its mobile and immobile creatures. O thou of<br>eyes like lotus leaves, it was thou who in days of yore hadst for the<br>benefit of all creatures raised from the sea the sunken earth, assuming<br>also the form of a boar. And, O best of male beings, assuming also the<br>form of half-man and half-lion, thou hadst slain in days of yore that<br>ancient Daitya of mighty prowess known by the name of Hiranyakasipu. And<br>that other great Asura also, Vali by name, was incapable of being slain<br>by any one. Assuming the form of a dwarf, thou exiledest him from the<br>three worlds. O lord, it was by thee that that wicked Asura, Jambha by<br>name, who was a mighty bowman and who always obstructed sacrifices, was<br>slain. Achievements like these, which cannot be counted, are thine. O<br>slayer of Madhu, we who have been afflicted with fear, have thee for our<br>refuge. It is for this, O god of gods, that we inform thee of our present<br>troubles. Protect the worlds, the gods, and Sakra also, from a terrible<br>fear.'"
