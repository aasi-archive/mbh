                            "Markandeya said, 'Learning that Kumbhakarna had with his followers,<br>fallen in battle as also that great warrior Prahasta, and Dhumraksha too<br>of mighty energy, Ravana then addressed his heroic son Indrajit saying,<br>'O slayer of foes, slay thou in battle Rama and Sugriva and Lakshmana. My<br>good son, it was by thee that this blazing fame of mine had been acquired<br>by vanquishing in battle that wielder of the thunderbolt, the<br>thousand-eyed Lord of Sachi! Having the power of appearing and vanishing<br>at thy will, slay thou, O smiter of foes, my enemies by means, O thou<br>foremost of all wielders of weapons, of thy celestial arrows received as<br>boons (from the gods)! Rama and Lakshmana and Sugriva are incapable of<br>enduring the bare touch of thy weapons. What shall I say, therefore, of<br>their followers? That cessation of hostilities which could not be brought<br>about by either Prahasta or Kumbhakarna in battle, be it thine, O<br>mighty-armed one, to bring about! Slaying my enemies with all their army<br>by means of thy keen-edged shafts, enhance my joy to-day, O son, as thou<br>didst once before by vanquishing Vasava!' Thus addressed by him. Indrajit<br>said&#8212;So be it,&#8212;and encased in mail he quickly ascended his chariot, and<br>proceeded, O king, towards the field of battle. And then that bull<br>amongst Rakshasas loudly announcing his own name, challenged Lakshmana<br>endued with auspicious marks, to a single combat. And Lakshmana, thus<br>challenged, rushed towards that Rakshasa, with his bow and arrows, and<br>striking terror into his adversary's heart by means of the flapping of<br>his bow-string on the leathern case of his left hand. And the encounter<br>that took place between those warriors that defied each other's prowess<br>and each of whom was desirous of vanquishing the other, and both of whom<br>were conversant with celestial weapons, was terrible in the extreme. But<br>when the son of Ravana found that he could not by his arrows gain any<br>advantage over his adversary, that foremost of mighty warriors mustered<br>all his energy. And Indrajit then began to hurl at Lakshmana with great<br>force numberless javelins. The son of Sumitra, however, cut them into<br>fragments by means of his own keen-edged arrows. And those javelins, thus<br>cut into pieces by the keen-edged arrows of Lakshmana, dropped down upon<br>the ground. Then the handsome Angada, the son of Vali, taking up a large<br>tree, rushed impetuously at Indrajit and struck him with it on the head.<br>Undaunted at this, Indrajit of mighty energy sought to smite Angada with<br>a lance. Just at that juncture, however, Lakshmana cut into pieces the<br>lance taken up by Ravana's son. The son of Ravana then took up a mace and<br>struck on the left flank that foremost of monkeys, the heroic Angada who<br>was then staying close beside him. Angada, the powerful son of Vali,<br>little recking that stroke, hurled at Indrajit a mighty Sal stem. And<br>hurled in wrath by Angada for the destruction of Indrajit, that tree, O<br>son of Pritha, destroyed Indrajit's chariot along with his horses and<br>charioteer. And thereupon jumping from his horseless and driverless car,<br>the son of Ravana disappeared from sight, O king, by aid of his powers of<br>illusion. And beholding that Rakshasa, abundantly endued with powers of<br>illusion, disappear so suddenly, Rama proceeded towards that spot and<br>began to protect his troops with care. Indrajit, however, with arrows,<br>obtained as boons from the gods, began to pierce both Rama and mighty<br>Lakshmana in every part of their bodies. Then the heroic Rama and<br>Lakshmana both continued to contend with their arrows against Ravana's<br>son who had made himself invisible by his powers of illusion. But<br>Indrajit continued to shower in wrath all over those lions among men his<br>keen-edged shafts by hundreds and thousands. And seeking that invisible<br>warrior who was ceaselessly showering his arrows, the monkeys penetrated<br>into every part of the firmament, armed with huge masses of stone. Them<br>as well as the two brothers, however, the invisible Rakshasa began to<br>afflict with his shafts. Indeed, the son of Ravana, concealing himself by<br>his powers of illusion, furiously attacked the monkey host. And the<br>heroic brothers Rama and Lakshmana, pierced all over with arrows, dropped<br>down on the ground like the Sun and the Moon fallen down from the<br>firmament.'"
