                            "Vyasa said, 'O wise Dhritarashtra, hear what I say! I will tell thee<br>that which is for the great good of all the Kauravas! O thou of mighty<br>arms, it hath not pleased me that the Pandavas have gone to the forest<br>dishonestly defeated (at dice) by Duryodhana and others! O Bharata, on<br>the expiration of the thirteenth year, recollecting all their woes, they<br>may shower death-dealing weapons, even like virulent poison, upon the<br>Kauravas! Why doth thy sinful son of wicked heart, ever inflamed with<br>ire, seek to slay the sons of Pandu for the sake of their kingdom? Let<br>the fool be restrained; let thy son remain quiet! In attempting to slay<br>the Pandavas in exile, he will only lose his own life. Thou art as honest<br>as the wise Vidura, or Bhishma, or ourselves, or Kripa, or Drona, O thou<br>of great wisdom, dissension with one's own kin are forbidden, sinful and<br>reprehensible! Therefore, O king, it behoveth thee to desist from such<br>acts! And, O Bharata, Duryodhana looketh with such jealousy towards the<br>Pandavas that great harm would be the consequence, if thou didst not<br>interfere. Or let this wicked son of thine, O monarch, along and<br>unaccompanied, himself go to the forest and live with the sons of Pandu.<br>For then, if the Pandavas, from association, feel an attachment for<br>Duryodhana, then, O king of men, good fortune may be thine. (This,<br>however, may not be)! For it hath been heard that one's congenital nature<br>leaveth him not till death. But what do Bhishma and Drona and Vidura<br>think? What also dost thou think? That which is beneficial should be done<br>while there is time, else thy purposes will be unrealised.'"
