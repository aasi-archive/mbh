                            "Vibhandaka said, 'Those are, O son! Rakshasas. They walk about in that<br>wonderfully beautiful form. Their strength is unrivalled and their beauty<br>great And they always meditate obstruction to the practice of penances.<br>And, O my boy, they assume lovely forms and try to allure by diverse<br>means. And those fierce beings hurled the saints, the dwellers of the<br>woods, from blessed regions (won by their pious deeds) And the saint who<br>hath control over his soul, and who is desirous of obtaining the regions<br>where go the righteous, ought to have nothing to do with them. And their<br>acts are vile and their delight is in causing obstruction to those who<br>practise penance; (therefore) a pious man should never look at them. And,<br>O son! those were drinks unworthy to be drunk, being as they were<br>spirituous liquors consumed by unrighteous men. And these garlands, also,<br>bright and fragrant and of various hues, are not intended for saints.'<br>Having thus forbidden his son by saying that those were wicked demons,<br>Vibhandaka went in quest of her. And when by three day's search he was<br>unable to trace where she was he then came back to his own hermitage. In<br>the meanwhile, when the son of Kasyapa had gone out to gather fruits,<br>then that very courtesan came again to tempt Rishyasringa in the manner<br>described above. And as soon as Rishyasringa had her in sight, he was<br>glad and hurriedly rushing towards him said, 'Let us go to thy hermitage<br>before the return of my father.' Then, O king! those same courtesans by<br>contrivances made the only son of Kasyapa enter their bark, and unmoored<br>the vessel. And by various means they went on delighting him and at<br>length came to the side of Anga's king. And leaving then that floating<br>vessel of an exceedingly white tint upon the water, and having placed it<br>within sight of the hermitage, he similarly prepared a beautiful forest<br>known by the name of the Floating Hermitage. The king, however, kept that<br>only son of Vibhandaka within that part of the palace destined for the<br>females when of a sudden he beheld that rain was poured by the heavens<br>and that the world began to be flooded with water. And Lomapada, the<br>desire of his heart fulfilled, bestowed his daughter Santa on<br>Rishyasringa in marriage. And with a view to appease the wrath of his<br>father, he ordered kine to be placed, and fields to be ploughed, by the<br>road that Vibhandaka was to take, in order to come to his son. And the<br>king also placed plentiful cattle and stout cowherds, and gave the latter<br>the following order:<br><br>"When the great saint Vibhandaka should enquire of you about his son, ye<br>must join your palms and say to him that these cattle, and these ploughed<br>fields belong to his son and that ye are his slaves, and that ye are<br>ready to obey him in all that he might bid.' Now the saint, whose wrath<br>was fierce, came to his hermitage, having gathered fruits and roots and<br>searched for his son. But not finding him he became exceedingly wroth.<br>And he was tortured with anger and suspected it to be the doing of the<br>king. And therefore, he directed his course towards the city of Champa<br>having made up his mind to burn the king, his city, and his whole<br>territory. And on the way he was fatigued and hungry, when he reached<br>those same settlements of cowherds, rich with cattle. And he was honoured<br>in a suitable way by those cowherds and then spent the night in a manner<br>befitting a king. And having received very great hospitality from them,<br>he asked them, saying, 'To whom, O cowherds, do ye belong?' Then they all<br>came up to him and said, 'All this wealth hath been provided for thy<br>son.' At different places he was thus honoured by that best of men, and<br>saw his son who looked like the god Indra in heaven. And he also beheld<br>there his daughter-in-law, Santa, looking like lightning issuing from a<br>(cloud). And having seen the hamlets and the cowpens provided for his son<br>and having also beheld Santa, his great resentment was appeased. And O<br>king of men! Vibhandaka expressed great satisfaction with the very ruler<br>of the earth. And the great saint, whose power rivalled that of the sun<br>and the god of fire, placed there his son, and thus spake, 'As soon as a<br>son is born to thee, and having performed all that is agreeable to the<br>king, to the forest must thou come without fail.' And Rishyasringa did<br>exactly as his father said, and went back to the place where his father<br>was. And, O king of men! Santa obediently waited upon him as in the<br>firmament the star Rohini waits upon the Moon, or as the fortunate<br>Arundhati waits upon Vasishtha, or as Lopamudra waits upon Agastya. And<br>as Damayanti was an obedient wife to Nala, or as Sachi is to the god who<br>holdeth the thunderbolt in his hand or as Indrasena, Narayana's daughter,<br>was always obedient to Mudgala, so did Santa wait affectionately upon<br>Rishyasringa, when he lived in the wood. This is the holy hermitage which<br>belonged to him. Beautifying the great lake here, it bears holy fame.<br>Here perform thy ablutions and have thy desire fulfilled. And having<br>purified thyself, direct thy course towards other holy spots,'"
