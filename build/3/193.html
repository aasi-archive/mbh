                            Vaisampayana said, "Then the sons of Pandu again addressed Markandeya<br>saying, 'Thou hast told us of greatness of Brahmanas. We desire now to<br>hear of the greatness of the royal Kshatriyas!" Thus addressed by them,<br>the great Rishi Markandeya spoke, 'Listen now to the greatness of the<br>royal Kshatriyas. A certain king of the name of Suhotra belonging to the<br>Kuru race went on a visit to the great Rishis. And as he was returning<br>from that visit, he beheld king Sivi the son of Usinara, seated on his<br>car, and as each came before the other, each saluted the other as best<br>befitted his age and each regarding himself as the equal of the other in<br>respect of qualities, refused to give the way to the other. And at this<br>juncture Narada appeared there, and beholding what had happened, the<br>celestial Rishi asked, 'Why is it that ye both stand here blocking each<br>other's way?' And thus questioned both of them spoke to Narada saying, 'O<br>holy one, do not speak so. The sages of old have declared that the way<br>should be given to one who is superior or to him that is abler. We,<br>however, that stand blocking each other's way are equal to each other in<br>every respect. Judged properly there is no superiority amongst us.' Thus<br>addressed by them, Narada recited three slokas. (They are these), 'O thou<br>of the Kuru race, he that is wicked behaveth wickedly even unto him that<br>is humble; he also that is humble behaveth with humility and honestly<br>unto him that is wicked! He that is honest behaveth honestly even towards<br>the dishonest. Why should he not behave honestly towards him that is<br>honest? He that is honest regardeth the service that is done to him, as<br>if it were a hundred times greater than it is. Is this not current<br>amongst the gods themselves? Certainly it is the royal son of Usinara who<br>is possessed of goodness that is greater than thine. One should conquer<br>the mean by charity; the untruthful by truth, the man of wicked deeds by<br>forgiveness; and the dishonest by honesty. Both of you are large-hearted.<br>Let one amongst you stand aside, according to the indication of the above<br>slokas.' And having said so Narada became silent, and hearing what Narada<br>had said the king of the Kuru race walking round Sivi, and praising his<br>numerous achievements, gave him the way and went on in his course. It was<br>even thus that Narada had described the high blessedness of the royal<br>Kshatriyas.'"
