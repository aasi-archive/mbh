                            "Markandeya said, 'And while those troops (thus withdrawn) were reposing<br>themselves in their quarters, many little Rakshasas and Pisachas owning<br>Ravana as their leader, penetrated amongst them. And among these were<br>Parvana, Patana, Jambha, Khara, Krodha-vasa, Hari, Praruja, Aruja and<br>Praghasa, and others. And as these wicked ones were penetrating (the<br>monkey host) in their invisible forms, Vibhishana, who had the knowledge<br>thereof, broke the spell of their invisibility. And once seen, O king, by<br>the powerful and long-leaping monkeys, they were all slain and prostrated<br>on the earth, deprived of life. And unable to endure this, Ravana marched<br>out at the head of his troops. And surrounded by his terrible army of<br>Rakshasas and Pisachas, Ravana who was conversant with the rules of<br>warfare like a second Usanas invested the monkey host, having disposed<br>his troops in that array which is named after Usanas himself. And<br>beholding Ravana advancing with his army disposed in that array, Rama,<br>following the mode recommended by Vrihaspati, disposed his troops in<br>counter array for opposing that wanderer of the night. And coming up<br>quickly, Ravana began to fight with Rama. And Lakshmana singled out<br>Indrajit, and Sugriva singled out Virupakshya, and Nikharvata fought with<br>Tara, and Nala with Tunda, and Patusa with Panasa. And each warrior,<br>advancing up to him whom he regarded as his match, began to fight with<br>him on that field of battle, relying on the strength of his own arms, and<br>that encounter, so frightful to timid persons, soon became terrible and<br>fierce like that between the gods and the Asuras in the days of old. And<br>Ravana covered Rama with a shower of darts and lances and swords, and<br>Rama also afflicted Ravana with his whetted arrows of iron furnished with<br>the sharpest points, and in the same way Lakshmana smote the contending<br>Indrajit with arrows capable of penetrating into the most vital parts and<br>Indrajit also smote Sumitra's son with an arrowy shower. And Vibhishana<br>showered upon Prahasta and Prahasta showered upon Vibhishana, without any<br>regard for each other a thick downpour of winged arrows furnished with<br>the sharpest points. And thus between those mighty warriors there came<br>about an encounter of celestial weapons of great force, at which the<br>three worlds with their mobile and immobile creatures were sorely<br>distressed."
