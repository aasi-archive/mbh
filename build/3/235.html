                            Vaisampayana said, "Hearing those words of Dhritarashtra, Sakuni, when<br>the opportunity presented itself, aided by Kama, spoke unto Duryodhana<br>these words, 'Having exiled the heroic Pandavas by thy own prowess, O<br>Bharata, rule thou this earth without a rival like the slayer of Samvara<br>ruling the heaven! O monarch, the kings of the east, the south, the west,<br>and the north, have all been made tributory to thee! O lord of earth,<br>that blazing Prosperity which had before paid her court to the sons of<br>Pandu, hath now been acquired by thee along with thy brothers! That<br>blazing Prosperity, O king, which we not many days ago saw with heavy<br>hearts in Yudhishthira at Indraprastha, is today seen by us to be owned<br>by thee, she having, O mighty-armed monarch, been snatched by thee from<br>the royal Yudhishthira by force of intellect alone. O slayer of hostile<br>heroes, all the kings of the earth now living in subjection to thee,<br>await thy commands, as they did before under Yudhishthira, awaiting his.<br>O monarch, the goddess Earth with her boundless extent with girth of<br>seas, with her mountains and forests, and towns and cities and mines, and<br>decked with woodlands and hills is now thine! Adored by the Brahmanas and<br>worshipped by the kings, thou blazest forth, O king, in consequence of<br>thy prowess, like the Sun among the gods in heaven! Surrounded by the<br>Kurus, O king, like Yama by the Rudra, or Vasava by the Maruts, thou<br>shinest, O monarch, like the Moon among the stars! Let us, therefore, O<br>king, go and look at the sons of Pandu&#8212;them who are now divested of<br>prosperity, them who never obeyed commands, them who never owed<br>subjection! It hath been heard by us, O monarch, that the Pandavas are<br>now living on the banks of the lake called Dwaitavana, with a multitude<br>of Brahmanas, having the wilderness for their home. Go thither, O king,<br>in all thy prosperity, scorching the son of Pandu with a sight of thy<br>glory, like the Sun scorching everything with his hot rays! Thyself a<br>sovereign and they divested of sovereignty, thyself in prosperity and<br>they divested of it, thyself possessing affluence and they in poverty,<br>behold now, O king, the sons of Pandu. Let the sons of Pandu behold thee<br>like Yayati, the son of Nahusha, accompanied by a large train of<br>followers and enjoying bliss that is great. O king, that blazing<br>Prosperity which is seen by both one's friends and foes, is regarded as<br>well-bestowed! What happiness can be more complete than that which he<br>enjoyeth who while himself in prosperity, looketh upon his foes in<br>adversity, like a person on the hill top looking down upon another<br>crawling on the earth? O tiger among kings, the happiness that one<br>derives from beholding his foes in grief, is greater than what one may<br>derive from the acquisition of offering or wealth or kingdom! What<br>happiness will not be his who, himself in affluence, will cast his eyes<br>on Dhananjaya attired in barks and deer-skins? Let thy wife dressed in<br>costly robes look at the woeful Krishna clad in barks and deer-skins, and<br>enhance the latter's grief! Let the daughter of Drupada reproach herself<br>and her life, divested as she is of wealth, for the sorrow that she will<br>feel upon beholding thy wife decked in ornaments will be far greater than<br>what she had felt in the midst of the assembly (when Dussasana had<br>dragged her there)!"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having thus spoken unto the king, Karna and<br>Sakuni both remained silent, O Janamejaya, after their discourse was<br>over."
