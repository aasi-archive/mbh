                            "Markandeya said, 'O bull of the Bharata race, even Rama suffered<br>unparalleled misery, for the evil-minded Ravana, king of the Rakshasas,<br>having recourse to deceit and overpowering the vulture Jatayu, forcibly<br>carried away his wife Sita from his asylum in the woods. Indeed, Rama,<br>with the help of Sugriva, brought her back, constructing a bridge across<br>the sea, and consuming Lanka with his keen-edged arrows.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'In what race was Rama born and what was the measure<br>of his might and prowess? Whose son also was Ravana and for what was it<br>that he had any misunderstanding with Rama? It behoveth thee, O<br>illustrious one, to tell me all this in detail; for I long to hear the<br>story of Rama of great achievements!'<br><br>"Markandeya said, 'Listen, O prince of Bharata's race, to this old<br>history exactly as it happened! I will tell thee all about the distress<br>suffered by Rama together with his wife. There was a great king named Aja<br>sprung from me race of Ikshwaku. He had a son named Dasaratha who was<br>devoted to the study of the Vedas and was ever pure. And Dasaratha had<br>four sons conversant with morality and profit known by the names,<br>respectively, of Rama, Lakshmana, Satrughna, and the mighty Bharata. And<br>Rama had for his mother Kausalya, and Bharata had for his mother Kaikeyi,<br>while those scourge of their enemies Lakshmana and Satrughna were the<br>sons of Sumitra. And Janaka was the king of Videha, and Sita was his<br>daughter. And Tashtri himself created her, desiring to make her the<br>beloved wife of Rama. I have now told thee the history of both Rama's and<br>Sita's birth. And now, O king, I will relate unto thee birth of Ravana.<br>That Lord of all creatures and the Creator of the Universe viz., the<br>Self-create Prajapati himself&#8212;that god possessed of great ascetic<br>merit&#8212;is the grandfather of Ravana. And Pulastya hath a mighty son<br>called Vaisravana begotten of a cow. But his son, leaving his father,<br>went to his grandfather. And, O king, angered at this, his father then<br>created a second self of himself. And with half of his own self that<br>regenerate one became born of Visrava for wrecking a vengeance on<br>Vaisravana. But the Grandsire, pleased with Vaisravana, gave him<br>immortality, and sovereignty of all the wealth of the Universe, the<br>guardianship of one of the cardinal points, the friendship of Isana, and<br>a son named Nalakuvera. And he also gave him for his capital Lanka, which<br>was guarded by hosts of Rakshasas, and also a chariot called Pushpaka<br>capable of going everywhere according to the will of the rider. And the<br>kingship of the Yakshas and the sovereignty over sovereigns were also<br>his.'"
