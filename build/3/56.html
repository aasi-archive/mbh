                            "Vrihadaswa said, 'Damayanti, having bowed down unto the gods, thus<br>addressed Nala with a smile, 'O king, love me with proper regard, and<br>command me what I shall do for thee. Myself and what else of wealth is<br>mine are thine. Grant me, O exalted one, thy love in full trust. O king,<br>the language of the swans in burning me. It is for thy sake, O hero, that<br>I have caused the kings to meet. O giver of proper honour, if thou<br>forsake me who adore thee, for thy sake will I resort to poison, or fire,<br>or water or the rope.' Thus addressed by the daughter of the king of the<br>Vidarbhas, Nala answered her saying, 'With the Lokapalas present,<br>choosest thou a man? Do thou turn thy heart to those high-souled lords,<br>the creators of the worlds, unto the dust of whose feet I am not equal.<br>Displeasing the gods, a mortal cometh by death. Save me, O thou of<br>faultless limbs! Choose thou the all-excelling celestials. By accepting<br>the gods, do thou enjoy spotless robes, and celestial garlands of<br>variegated hues, and excellent ornaments. What woman would not choose as<br>her lord Hutasana&#8212;the chief of the celestials, who compassing the earth<br>swalloweth it? What woman would not choose him as her lord the dread of<br>whose mace induceth all creatures to tread the path of virtue? And what<br>woman would not choose as her lord the virtuous and high-souled Mahendra,<br>the lord of the celestials, the chastiser of Daityas and Danavas? Or, if<br>thou couldst choose in thy heart Varuna amongst the Lokapalas, do so<br>unhesitatingly. O accept this friendly advice.' Thus addressed by<br>Naishadha, Damayanti, with eyes bathed in tears of grief spake thus unto<br>Nala, 'O lord of the earth, bowing to all the gods, I choose thee for my<br>lord. Truly do I tell thee this.' The king, who had come as the messenger<br>of the gods, replied unto the trembling Damayanti standing with folded<br>hands, 'O amiable one, do as thou pleasest. Having given my pledge, O<br>blessed one, unto the gods in especial, how can I, having come on other's<br>mission, dare seek my own interest? If seeking my own interest consists<br>with virtue, I will seek it, and do thou also, O beauteous one, act<br>accordingly.' Then Damayanti of luminous smiles slowly spake unto king<br>Nala, in words choked with tears, 'O lord of men I see a blameless way,<br>by which no sin whatever will attach unto thee. O king, do thou, O<br>foremost of men, come to the Swayamvara in company with all the gods<br>headed by Indra. There, O Monarch, in the presence of the Lokapalas I<br>will, O tiger among men, choose thee&#8212;at which no blame will be thine.'<br>Thus addressed, O monarch, by the daughter of Vidarbha, king Nala<br>returned to where the gods were staying together. And beholding him<br>approach those great gods, the Lokapalas, eagerly asked him about all<br>that had happened saying, 'Hast thou, O king, seen Damayanti of sweet<br>smiles? What hath she said unto us all? O sinless monarch, tell us<br>everything.' Nala answered, 'Commanded by you I entered Damayanti's<br>palace furnished with lofty portals guarded by veteran warders bearing<br>wands. And as I entered, no one perceived me, by virtue of your power,<br>except the princess. And I saw her hand-maids, and they also saw me. And,<br>O exalted celestials, seeing me, they were filled with wonder. And as I<br>spake unto her of you, the fair-faced maiden, her will fixed on me, O ye<br>best of the gods, chose me (for her spouse).' And the maiden said, 'Let<br>the gods, O tiger among men, come with thee to the Swayamvara, I will in<br>their presence, choose thee. At this, O thou of mighty arms, no blame<br>will attach to thee.' 'This is all, ye gods, that took place, as I have<br>said. Finally, everything rests with you, ye foremost of celestials.'"
