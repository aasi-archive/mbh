                            Vaisampayana said, "Meanwhile those foremost of bowmen on the face of the<br>earth, having wandered separately and ranged in all directions, and<br>having slain plenty of deer and buffaloes, at length met together. And<br>observing that great forest, which was crowded with hosts of deer and<br>wild beasts, resounding with the shrill cries of birds, and hearing the<br>shrieks and yells of the denizens of the wilderness. Yudhishthira said<br>unto his brothers. 'These birds and wild beasts, flying towards that<br>direction which is illuminated by the sun, are uttering dissonant cries<br>and displaying an intense excitement. All this only shows that this<br>mighty forest hath been invaded by hostile intruders. Without a moment's<br>delay let us give up the chase. We have no more need of game. My heart<br>aches and seems to burn! The soul in my body, over-powering the<br>intellect, seems ready to fly out. As a lake rid by Garuda of the mighty<br>snake that dwells in it, as a pot drained of its contents by thirsty men,<br>as a kingdom reft of king and prosperity, even so doth the forest of<br>Kamyaka seem to me.' Thus addressed, those heroic warriors drove towards<br>their abode, on great cars of handsome make and drawn by steeds of the<br>Saindharva breed exceedingly fleet and possessed of the speed of the<br>hurricane. And on their way back, they beheld a jackal yelling hideously<br>on the wayside towards their left. And king Yudhishthira, regarding it<br>attentively, said unto Bhima and Dhananjaya, 'This jackal that belongs to<br>a very inferior species of animals, speaking to our left, speaketh a<br>language which plainly indicates that the sinful Kurus, disregarding us,<br>have commenced to oppress us by resorting to violence.' After the sons of<br>Pandu had given up the chase and said these words, they entered the grove<br>which contained their hermitage. And there they found their beloved one's<br>maid, the girl Dhatreyika, sobbing and weeping. And Indrasena then<br>quickly alighting from the chariot and advancing with hasty steps towards<br>her, questioned her, O king, in great distress of mind, saying, 'What<br>makes thee weep thus, lying on the ground, and why is thy face so<br>woe-begone and colourless? I hope no cruel wretches have done any harm to<br>the princess Draupadi possessed of incomparable beauty and large eyes and<br>who is the second self of every one of those bulls of the Kuru race? So<br>anxious hath been Dharma's son that if the princess hath entered the<br>bowels of the earth or hath soared to heaven or dived into the bottom of<br>the ocean, he and his brothers will go thither in pursuit of her. Who<br>could that fool be that would carry away that priceless jewel belonging<br>to the mighty and ever-victorious sons of Pandu, those grinders of foes,<br>and which is dear unto them as their own lives? I don't know who the<br>person could be that would think of carrying away that princess who hath<br>such powerful protectors and who is even like a walking embodiment of the<br>hearts of the sons of Pandu? Piercing whose breasts will terrible shafts<br>stick to the ground to-day? Do not weep for her, O timid girl, for know<br>thou that Krishna will come back this very day, and the sons of Pritha,<br>having slain their foes, will again be united with Yagnaseni!' Thus<br>addressed by him, Dhatreyika, wiping her beautiful face, replied unto<br>Indrasena the charioteer, saying, 'Disregarding the five Indra-like sons<br>of Pandu, Jayadratha hath carried away Krishna by force. The track<br>pursued by him hath not yet disappeared, for the broken branches of trees<br>have not yet faded. Therefore, turn your cars and follow her quickly, for<br>the princess cannot have gone far by this time! Ye warriors possessed of<br>the prowess of Indra, putting on your costly bows of handsome make, and<br>taking up your costly bows and quivers, speed ye in pursuit of her, lest<br>overpowered by threats or violence and losing her sense and the colour of<br>her cheeks, she yields herself up to an undeserving wight, even as one<br>poureth forth, from the sacrificial ladle, the sanctified oblation on a<br>heap of ashes. O, see that the clarified butter is not poured into an<br>unigniting fire of paddy chaff; that a garland of flowers is not thrown<br>away in a cemetery. O, take care that the Soma juice of a sacrifice is<br>not licked up by a dog through the carelessness of the officiating<br>priests! O, let not the lily be rudely torn by a jackal roaming for its<br>prey in the impenetrable forest. O, let no inferior wight touch with his<br>lips the bright and beautiful face of your wife, fair as the beams of the<br>moon and adorned with the finest nose and the handsomest eyes, like a dog<br>licking clarified butter kept in the sacrificial pot! Do ye speed in this<br>track and let not time steal a march on you.'<br><br>Yudhishthira said, 'Retire, good woman, and control thy tongue. Speak not<br>this way before us. Kings or princes, whoever are infatuated with the<br>possession of power, are sure to come to grief!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "With these words, they departed, following the<br>track pointed out to them, and frequently breathing deep sighs like the<br>hissing of snakes, and twanging the strings of their large bows. And then<br>they observed a cloud of dust raised by the hoofs of the steeds belonging<br>to Jayadratha's army. And they also saw Dhaumya in the midst of the<br>ravisher's infantry, exhorting Bhima to quicken his steps. Then those<br>princes (the sons of Pandu) with hearts undepressed, bade him be of good<br>cheer and said unto him, 'Do thou return cheerfully!'&#8212;And then they<br>rushed towards that host with great fury, like hawks swooping down on<br>their prey. And possessed of the prowess of Indra, they had been filled<br>with fury at the insult offered to Draupadi. But at sight of Jayadratha<br>and of their beloved wife seated on his car, their fury knew no bounds.<br>And those mighty bowmen, Bhima and Dhananjaya and the twin brothers and<br>the king, called out Jayadratha to stop, upon which the enemy was so<br>bewildered as to lose their knowledge of directions."
