                            "Vrihadaswa said, 'Having passed that night, king Nala decked in<br>ornaments and with Damayanti by his side, presented himself in due time<br>before the king. And Nala saluted his father-in-law with becoming<br>humility and after him the fair Damayanti paid her respects to her<br>father. And the exalted Bhima, with great joy, received him as a son, and<br>honouring him duly along with his devoted wife, comforted them in proper<br>words. And duly accepting the homage rendered unto him, king Nala offered<br>his father-in-law his services as became him. And seeing Nala arrived,<br>the citizens were in great joy. And there arose in the city a loud uproar<br>of delight. And the citizens decorated the city with flags and standards<br>and garlands of flowers. And the streets were watered and decked in<br>floral wreaths and other ornaments. And at their gates citizens piled<br>flowers, and their temples and shrines were all adorned with flowers. And<br>Rituparna heard that Vahuka had already been united with Damayanti. And<br>the king was glad to hear of all this. And calling unto him king Nala, he<br>asked his forgiveness. And the intelligent Nala also asked Rituparna's<br>forgiveness, showing diverse reasons. And that foremost of speakers<br>versed in the truth, king Rituparna, after being thus honoured by Nala,<br>said, with a countenance expressive of wonder, these words unto the ruler<br>of the Nishadhas. 'By good fortune it is that regaining the company of<br>thy own wife, thou hast obtained happiness. O Naishadha, while dwelling<br>in disguise at my house, I hope I did not wrong thee in any way, O lord<br>of the earth! If knowingly I have done thee any wrong, it behoveth thee<br>to forgive me.' Hearing this, Nala replied, 'Thou hast not, O monarch,<br>done me ever so little an injury. And if thou hast, it hath not awakened<br>my ire, for surely thou shouldst be forgiven by me. Thou wert formerly my<br>friend, and, O ruler of men, thou art also related to me. Henceforth I<br>shall find greater delight in thee. O king, with all my desires<br>gratified, I lived happily in thy abode, in fact more happily there than<br>in my own house. This thy horse-lore is in my keeping. If thou wishest, O<br>king, I will make it over to thee.' Saying this, Naishadha gave unto<br>Rituparna that science and the latter took it with the ordained rites.<br>And, O monarch, the royal son of Bhangasura, having obtained the<br>mysteries of equestrian science and having given unto the ruler of the<br>Naishadhas the mysteries of dice, went to his own city, employing another<br>person for his charioteer. And, O king, after Rituparna had gone, king<br>Nala did not stay long in the city of Kundina!'"
