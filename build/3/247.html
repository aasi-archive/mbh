                            Duryodhana said, "That slayer of hostile heroes, Arjuna, then approaching<br>Chitrasena, smilingly addressed him in these manly words: 'O hero, O<br>foremost of the Gandharvas, it behoveth thee to set my brothers at<br>liberty. They are incapable of being insulted as long as the sons of<br>Pandu are alive.' 'Thus addressed by the illustrious son of Pandu, the<br>chief of the Gandharvas, O Karna, disclosed unto the Pandavas the object<br>we had in view in proceeding to that place, viz., that we came there for<br>casting our eyes on the sons of Pandu with their wife, all plunged in<br>misery. And while the Gandharva was disclosing those counsels of ours,<br>overwhelmed with shame I desired the earth to yield me a crevice, so that<br>I might disappear there and then. The Gandharvas then, accompanied by the<br>Pandavas, went to Yudhishthira, and, disclosing unto him also counsels,<br>made us over, bound as we were, to him. Alas, what greater sorrow could<br>be mine than that I should thus be offered as a tribute unto<br>Yudhishthira, in the very sight of the women of our household, myself in<br>chains and plunged in misery, and under the absolute control of my<br>enemies. Alas, they, who have ever been persecuted by me, they unto whom<br>I have ever been a foe released me from captivity, and wretch that I am,<br>I am indebted to them for my life. If, O hero, I had met with my death in<br>that great battle, that would have been far better than that I should<br>have obtained my life in this way. If I had been slain by the Gandharvas,<br>my fame would have spread over the whole earth, and I should have<br>obtained auspicious regions of eternal bliss in the heaven of Indra.<br>Listen to me therefore, ye bulls among men, as to what I intend to do<br>now. I will stay here forgoing all food, while ye all return home. Let<br>all my brothers also go to Hastinapura. Let all our friends, including<br>Karna, and all our relatives headed by Dussasana, return now to the<br>capital. Insulted by the foe, I myself will not repair thither. I who had<br>before wrested from the foe his respect, I who had always enchanced the<br>respect of my friends, have now become a source of sorrow unto friends<br>and of joy unto enemies. What shall I now say unto the king, going to the<br>city named after the elephant? What will Bhishma and Drona, Kripa, and<br>Drona's son, Vidura and Sanjaya, Vahuka and Somadatta and other revered<br>seniors,&#8212;what will the principal men of the other orders and men of<br>independent professions, say to me and what shall I say unto them in<br>reply? Having hitherto stayed over the heads of my enemies, having<br>hitherto trod upon their breasts, I have fallen away from my position.<br>How shall I ever speak with them? Insolent men having obtained prosperity<br>and knowledge and affluence, are seldom blest for any length of time like<br>myself puffed up with vanity. Alas, led by folly I have done a highly<br>improper and wicked act, for which, fool that I am, I have fallen into<br>such distress. Therefore, will I perish by starving, life having become<br>insupportable to me. Relieved from distress by the foe, what man of<br>spirit is there who can drag on his existence? Proud as I am, shorn of<br>manliness, the foe hath laughed at me, for the Pandavas possessed of<br>prowess have looked at me plunged in misery!"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, 'While giving way to such reflections Duryodhana<br>spoke unto Dussasana thus: 'O Dussasana, listen to these words of mine, O<br>thou of the Bharata race! Accepting this installation that I offer thee,<br>be thou king in my place. Rule thou the wide earth protected by Karna and<br>Suvala's sons. Like Indra himself looking after the Maruts, cherish thou<br>thy brothers in such a way that they may all confide in thee. Let the<br>friends and relatives depend on thee like the gods depending on him of a<br>hundred sacrifices. Always shouldst thou bestow pensions on Brahmanas,<br>without idleness, and be thou ever the refuge of thy friends and<br>relatives. Like Vishnu looking after the celestials, thou shouldst always<br>look after all consanguineous relatives. Thou shouldst also ever cherish<br>thy superiors. Go, rule thou the earth gladdening thy friends and<br>reproving thy foes.' And clasping his neck, Duryodhana said, 'Go!'<br>Hearing these words of his, Dussasana in perfect cheerlessness and<br>overwhelmed with great sorrow, his voice choked in tears, said, with<br>joined hands and bending his head unto his eldest brother, 'Relent!' And<br>saying this he fell down on earth with heavy heart. And afflicted with<br>grief that tiger among men, shedding his tears on the feet of his brother<br>again said, 'This will never be! The earth may split, the vault of heaven<br>may break in pieces, the sun may cast off his splendour, the moon may<br>abandon his coolness, the wind may forsake its speed, the Himavat may be<br>moved from its site, the waters of the ocean may dry up, and fire may<br>abandon its heat, yet I, O king, may never rule the earth without thee.'<br>And Dussasana repeatedly said, 'Relent, O king! Thou alone shall be king<br>in our race for a hundred years.' And having spoken thus unto the king,<br>Dussasana began to weep melodiously catching, O Bharata, the feet of his<br>eldest brother deserving of worship from him.<br><br>"And beholding Dussasana and Duryodhana thus weeping, Karna in great<br>grief approached them both and said, 'Ye, Kuru princes, why do you thus<br>yield to sorrow like ordinary men, from senselessness? Mere weeping can<br>never ease a sorrowing man's grief. When weeping can never remove one's<br>griefs, what do you gain by thus giving way to sorrow? Summon patience to<br>your aid to not gladden the foe by such conduct. O king, the Pandavas<br>only did their duty in liberating thee. They that reside in the dominions<br>of the king, should always do what is agreeable to the king. Protected by<br>thee, the Pandavas are residing happily in thy dominion. It behoveth thee<br>not to indulge in such sorrow like an ordinary person. Behold, thy<br>uterine brothers are all sad and cheerless at seeing thee resolved to put<br>an end to thy life by forgoing food. Blest be thou! Rise up and come to<br>thy city and console these thy uterine brothers."
