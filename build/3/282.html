                            "Markandeya said, 'Having quartered his army in those groves abounding<br>with food and water and with fruits and roots, the descendant of<br>Kakutstha began to watch over them with care. Ravana, on the other hand,<br>planted in his city many appliances constructed according to the rules of<br>military science. And his city, naturally impregnable on account of its<br>strong ramparts and gate-ways, had seven trenches, that were deep and<br>full of water to the brim and that abounded with fishes and sharks and<br>alligators, made more impregnable still by means of pointed stakes of<br>Khadira wood. And the ramparts, heaped with stones, were made impregnable<br>by means of catapults. And the warriors (who guarded the walls) were<br>armed with earthen pots filled with venomous snakes, and with resinous<br>powders of many kinds. And they were also armed with clubs, and<br>fire-brands and arrows and lances and swords and battle-axes. And they<br>had also Sataghnis[98] and stout maces steeped in wax.[99] And at all the<br>gates of the city were planted movable and immovable encampments manned<br>by large numbers of infantry supported by countless elephants and horses.<br>And Angada, having reached one of the gates of the city, was made known<br>to the Rakshasas. And he entered the town without suspicion or fear. And<br>surrounded by countless Rakshasas, that hero in his beauty looked like<br>the Sun himself in the midst of masses of clouds. And having approached<br>the hero of Pulastya's race in the midst of his counsellors, the eloquent<br>Angada saluted the king and began to deliver Rama's message in these<br>words, 'That descendant of Raghu, O king, who ruleth at Kosala and whose<br>renown hath spread over the whole world, sayeth unto thee these words<br>suited to the occasion. Accept thou that message and act according to it!<br>Provinces and towns, in consequence of their connection with sinful kings<br>incapable of controlling their souls, are themselves polluted and<br>destroyed. By the violent abduction of Sita, thou alone hast injured me!<br>Thou, however, wilt become the cause of death to many unoffending<br>persons. Possessed of power and filled with pride, thou hast, before<br>this, slain many Rishis living in the woods, and insulted the very gods.<br>Thou hast slain also many great kings and many weeping women. For those<br>transgressions of thine, retribution is about to overtake thee! I will<br>slay thee with thy counsellors. Fight and show thy courage![100] O<br>wanderer of the night, behold the power of my bow, although I am but a<br>man! Release Sita, the daughter of Janaka! If thou dost not release her,<br>I shall make the Earth divested of all Rakshasas with my keen-edged<br>arrows!' Hearing these defiant words of the enemy, king Ravana bore them<br>ill, becoming senseless with wrath. And thereupon four Rakshasas skilled<br>in reading every sign of their master, seized Angada like four hawks<br>seizing a tiger. With those Rakshasas, however, holding him fast by his<br>limbs, Angada leaped upwards and alighted on the palace terrace. And as<br>he leaped up with a great force, those wanderers of the night fell down<br>the earth, and bruised by the violence of the fall, had their ribs<br>broken. And from the golden terrace on which he had alighted, he took a<br>downward leap. And overleaping the walls of Lanka, he alighted to where<br>his comrades were. And approaching the presence of the lord of Kosala and<br>informing him of everything, the monkey Angada endued with great energy<br>retired to refresh himself, dismissed with due respect by Rama.<br><br>The descendant of Raghu then caused the ramparts of Lanka to be broken<br>down by a united attack of all those monkeys endued with the speed of the<br>wind. Then Lakshmana, with Vibhishana and the king of the bears marching<br>in the van, blew up the southern gate of the city that was almost<br>impregnable. Rama then attacked Lanka with a hundred thousand crores of<br>monkeys, all possessed of great skill in battle, and endued with reddish<br>complexions like those of young camels. And those crores of greyish bears<br>with long arms, and legs and huge paws, and generally supporting<br>themselves on their broad haunches, were also urged on to support the<br>attack. And in consequence of those monkeys leaping up and leaping down<br>and leaping in transverse directions, the Sun himself, his bright disc<br>completely shaded, became invisible for the dust they raised. And the<br>citizens of Lanka beheld the wall of their town assume all over a tawny<br>hue, covered by monkeys of complexions yellow as the ears of paddy, and<br>grey as Shirisha flowers, and red as the rising Sun, and white as flax or<br>hemp. And the Rakshasas, O king, with their wives and elders, were struck<br>with wonders at that sight. And the monkey warriors began to pull down<br>pillars made of precious stones and the terraces and tops of palatial<br>mansions. And breaking into fragments the propellers of catapults and<br>other engines, they began to cast them about in all directions. And<br>taking up the Sataghnis along with the discs, the clubs, and stones, they<br>threw them down into the city with great force and loud noise. And<br>attacked thus by the monkeys, those Rakshasas that had been placed on the<br>walls to guard them, fled precipitately by hundreds and thousands.<br><br>"Then hundreds of thousands of Rakshasas, of terrible mien, and capable<br>of assuming any form at will, came out at the command of the king. And<br>pouring a perfect shower of arrows and driving the denizens of the<br>forest, those warriors, displaying great prowess, adorned the ramparts.<br>And soon those wanderers of the night, looking like masses of flesh, and<br>of terrible mien, forced the monkeys to leave the walls. And mangled by<br>the enemies' lances, numerous monkey-chiefs fell down from the ramparts,<br>and crushed by the falling columns and gate-ways, numerous Rakshasas also<br>fell down to rise no more. And the monkeys and the brave Rakshasas that<br>commenced to eat up the foe, struggled, seizing one another by the hair,<br>and mangling and tearing one another with their nails and teeth. And the<br>monkeys and the Rakshasas roared and yelled frightfully, and while many<br>of both parties were slain and fell down to rise no more, neither side<br>gave up the contest. And Rama continued all the while to shower a thick<br>downpour of arrows like the very clouds. And the arrows he shot,<br>enveloping Lanka, killed large numbers of Rakshasas. And the son of<br>Sumitra, too, that mighty bowman incapable of being fatigued in battle,<br>naming particular Rakshasas stationed on the ramparts, slew them with his<br>clothyard shafts. And then the monkey host, having achieved success was<br>withdrawn at the command of Rama, after it had thus pulled down the<br>fortifications of Lanka and made all objects within the city capable of<br>being aimed at by the besieging force."
