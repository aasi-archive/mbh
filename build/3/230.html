                            Markandeya continued, "When Skanda had bestowed these powers, Swaha<br>appeared to him and said, 'Thou art my natural son,&#8212;I desire that thou<br>shalt grant exquisite happiness to me."<br><br>"Skanda replied, 'What sort of happiness dost thou wish to enjoy?'"<br><br>"Swaha replied, 'O mighty being, I am the favourite daughter of Daksha,<br>by name Swaha; and from my youthful days I have been in love with<br>Hutasana (the Fire-god); but that god, my son, does not understand my<br>feelings. I desire to live for ever with him (as his wife).'"<br><br>"Skanda replied, 'From this day, lady, all the oblations that men of<br>virtuous character, who swerve not from the path of virtue, will offer to<br>their gods or ancestors with incantation of purifying hymns by Brahmanas,<br>shall always be offered (through Agni) coupled with the name of Swaha,<br>and thus, excellent lady, wilt thou always live associated with Agni, the<br>god of fire.'"<br><br>"Markandeya continued, Thus addressed and honoured by Skanda, Swaha was<br>greatly pleased; and associated with her husband Pavaka (the Fire-god),<br>she honoured him in return.'"<br><br>"Then Brahma, the lord of all creatures, said to Mahasena, 'Do thou go<br>and visit thy father Mahadeva, the conqueror of Tripura. Rudra coalescing<br>with Agni (the Fire-god) and Uma with Swaha have combined to make thee<br>invincible for the well-being of all creatures. And the semen of the<br>high-souled Rudra cast into the reproductive organ of Uma was thrown back<br>upon this hill, and hence the twin Mujika and Minjika came into being. A<br>portion of it fell into the Blood Sea, another portion, into the rays of<br>the sun, another upon the earth and thus was it distributed in five<br>portions. Learned men ought to remember that these thy various and<br>fierce-looking followers living on the flesh of animals were produced<br>from the semen'. 'Be it so,' so saying, the high-souled Mahasena with<br>fatherly love, honoured his father Maheswara."<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Men who are desirous of acquiring wealth, should<br>worship those five classes of spirits with the sun flower, and for<br>alleviation of diseases also worship must be rendered to them. The twin<br>Mujika and Minjika begotten by Rudra must always be respected by persons<br>desiring the welfare of little children; and persons who desire to have<br>children born to them must always worship those female spirits who live<br>on human flesh and are produced in trees. Thus all Pisachas are said to<br>be divided into innumerable classes. And now, O king, listen to the<br>origin of the bells and standards of Skanda. Airavata (Indra's elephant)<br>is known to have had two bells of the name of Vaijayanti, and the<br>keen-witted Sakra had them brought to him, and personally gave them to<br>Guha. Visakha took one of those bells and Skanda the other. The standards<br>of both Kartikeya and Visakha were of a red colour. That mighty god<br>Mahasena was pleased with the toys that had been given to him by the<br>gods. Surrounded by hosts of gods and Pisachas and seated on the Golden<br>Mountain, he looked splendid in all the grandeur of prosperity. And that<br>mountain covered with fine forests, also looked grand in his<br>companionship, just as the Mandara hill abounding with excellent caves<br>shines with the rays of the sun. The White Mountain was adorned with<br>whole tracts of wood-land covered with blossoming Santanaka flowers and<br>with forests of Karavira, Parijata, Jana and Asoke trees,&#8212;as also with<br>wild tracts overgrown with Kadamva trees; and it abounded with herds of<br>celestial deer and flocks of celestial birds. And the rumbling of clouds<br>serving the purpose of musical instruments sounded like the murmur of an<br>agitated sea, and celestial Gandharvas and Apsaras began to dance. And<br>there arose a great sound of joy from the merriment of all creatures.<br>Thus the whole world with Indra himself seemed to have been transferred<br>to the White Mountain. And all the people began to observe Skanda with<br>satisfaction in their looks, and they did not at all feel tired of doing<br>so."<br><br>Markandeya continued, "When that adorable son of the Fire-god was<br>anointed as leader of the celestial army, that grand and happy lord, Hara<br>(Mahadeva) riding with Parvati in a chariot shining with sunlike<br>refulgence repaired to a place called Bhadravata. His excellent chariot<br>was drawn by a thousand lions and managed by Kala. They passed through<br>blank space, and seemed as if they were about to devour the sky; and<br>striking terror into the heart of all creatures in the mobile divisions<br>of the worlds, those maned beasts flitted through the air, uttering<br>fearful growls. And that lord of all animals (Mahadeva) seated in that<br>chariot with Uma, looked like the sun with flames of lightning<br>illuminating masses of clouds begirt with Indra's bow (rainbow). He was<br>preceded by that adorable Lord of riches riding on the backs of human<br>beings with his attendant Guhyakas riding in his beautiful car Pushpaka.<br>And Sakra too riding on his elephant Airavata and accompanied by other<br>gods brought up the rear of Mahadeva, the granter of boons, marching in<br>this way at the head of the celestial army. And the great Yaksha Amogha<br>with his attendants&#8212;the Jambhaka Yakshas and other Rakshasas decorated<br>with garlands of flowers&#8212;obtained a place in the right wing of his army;<br>and many gods of wonderful fighting powers in company with the Vasus and<br>the Rudras, also marched with the right division of his army. And the<br>terrible-looking Yama too in company with Death marched with him.<br>(followed by hundreds of terrible diseases); and behind him was carried<br>the terrible, sharp-pointed, well-decorated trident of Siva, called<br>Vijaya. And Varuna, the adorable lord of waters with his terrible<br>Pasa,[80] and surrounded by numerous aquatic animals, marched slowly with<br>the trident. And the trident Vijaya was followed by the Pattisa[81] of<br>Rudra guarded by maces, balls, clubs and other excellent weapons. And the<br>Pattisa, O king, was followed by the bright umbrella of Rudra and the<br>Kamandalu served by the Maharshis; and on it progressed in the company of<br>Bhrigu, Angiras and others. And behind all these rode Rudra in his white<br>chariot, re-assuring the gods with the exhibition of his powers. And<br>rivers and lakes and seas, Apsaras, Rishis, Celestials, Gandharvas and<br>serpents, stars, planets, and the children of gods, as also many women,<br>followed him in his train. These handsome-looking ladies proceeded<br>scattering flowers all around; and the clouds marched, having made their<br>obeisance to that god (Mahadeva) armed with the Pinaka bow. And some of<br>them held a white umbrella over his head, and Agni (the Fire god) and<br>Vayu (the god of winds) busied themselves with two hairy fans (emblems of<br>royalty). And, O king, he was followed by the glorious Indra accompanied<br>by the Rajarshis, and singing the praise of that god with the emblem of<br>the bull. And Gauri, Vidya, Gandhari, Kesini, and the lady called Mitra<br>in company with Savitri, all proceeded in the train of Parvati, as also<br>all the Vidyas (presiding deities of all branches of knowledge) that were<br>created by the learned. The Rakshasa spirit who delivers to different<br>battalions the commands which are implicitly obeyed by Indra and other<br>gods, advanced in front of the army as standard-bearer. And that foremost<br>of Rakshasas, by name Pingala, the friend of Rudra, who is always busy in<br>places where corpses are burnt, and who is agreeable to all people,<br>marched with them merrily, at one time going ahead of the army, and<br>falling behind again at another, his movements being uncertain. Virtuous<br>actions are the offerings with which the god Rudra is worshipped by<br>mortals. He who is also called Siva, the omnipotent god, armed with the<br>Pinaka bow, is Maheswara. He is worshipped in various forms.<br><br>"The son of Krittika, the leader of the celestial army, respectful to<br>Brahmanas, surrounded by the celestial forces, also followed that lord of<br>the gods. And then Mahadeva said these weighty words to Mahasena, 'Do<br>thou carefully command the seventh army corps of the celestial forces.'<br><br>"Skanda replied, 'Very well, my lord! I shall command the seventh army<br>corps. Now tell me quickly if there is anything else to be done.'<br><br>"Rudra said, 'Thou shall always find me in the field of action. By<br>looking up to me and by devotion to me shalt thou attain great welfare.'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'With these words Maheswara received him in his<br>embrace, and then dismissed him. And, O great king, after the dismissal<br>of Skanda, prodigies of various kinds occurred to disturb the equanimity<br>of the gods.'<br><br>"The firmament with the stars was in a blaze, and the whole universe in a<br>state of utter confusion. The earth quaked and gave forth a rumbling<br>sound, and darkness overspread the whole world. Then observing this<br>terrible catastrophe, Sankara with the estimable Uma, and the celestials<br>with the great Maharshis, were much exercised in mind. And when they had<br>fallen into this state of confusion, there appeared before them a fierce<br>and mighty host armed with various weapons, and looking like a mass of<br>clouds and rocks. Those terrible and countless beings, speaking different<br>languages directed their movements towards the point where Sankara and<br>the celestials stood. They hurled into the ranks of the celestial army<br>flights of arrows in all directions, masses of rock, maces, sataghnis,<br>prasas and parighas. The celestial army was thrown into a state of<br>confusion by a shower of these terrible weapons and their ranks were seen<br>to waver. The Danavas made a great havoc by cutting up their soldiers,<br>horses, elephants, chariots and arms. And the celestial troops then<br>seemed as if they were about to turn their backs upon the enemy. And<br>numbers of them fell, slain by the Asuras, like large trees in a forest<br>burnt in a conflagration. Those dwellers of heaven fell with their heads,<br>separated from their bodies, and having none to lead them in that fearful<br>battle, they were slaughtered by the enemy. And then the god Purandara<br>(Indra), the slayer of Vala, observing that they were unsteady and<br>hard-pressed by the Asuras, tried to rally them with this speech, 'Do not<br>be afraid, ye heroes, may success attend your efforts! Do ye all take up<br>your arms, and resolve upon manly conduct, and ye will meet with no more<br>misfortune, and defeat those wicked and terrible-looking Danavas. May ye<br>be successful! Do ye fall upon the Danavas with me.'<br><br>"The dwellers of heaven were re-assured on hearing this speech from<br>Sakra; and under his leadership, they again rushed against the Danavas.<br>And then the thirty-three crores of gods and all the powerful Marutas and<br>the Sadhyas with the Vasus returned to the charge. And the arrows which<br>they angrily discharged against the enemy drew a large quantity of blood<br>from the bodies of the Daityas and of their horses and elephants. And<br>those sharp arrows passing through their bodies fell upon the ground,<br>looking like so many snakes falling from the sides of a hill. And, O<br>king, the Daityas pierced by those arrows fell fast on all sides, looking<br>like so many detached masses of clouds. Then the Danava host, struck with<br>panic at that charge of the celestials on the field of battle, wavered at<br>that shower of various weapons. Then all the gods loudly gave vent to<br>their joy, with arms ready to strike; and the celestial bands too struck<br>up various airs. Thus took place that encounter, so fearful to both<br>sides: for all the battle-field was covered with blood and strewn with<br>the bodies of both gods and Asuras. But the gods were soon worsted all on<br>a sudden, and the terrible Danavas again made a great havoc of the<br>celestial army. Then the Asuras, drums struck up and their shrill bugles<br>were sounded; and the Danava chiefs yelled their terrific war-cry.<br><br>"Then a powerful Danava, taking a huge mass of rock in his hands, came<br>out of that terrible Daitya army. He looked like the sun peering forth<br>from against a mass of dark clouds. And, O king, the celestials,<br>beholding that he was about to hurl that mass of rock at them, fled in<br>confusion. But they were pursued by Mahisha, who hurled that hillock at<br>them. And, O lord of the world, by the falling of that mass of rock, ten<br>thousand warriors of the celestial army were crushed to the ground and<br>breathed their last. And this act of Mahisha struck terror into the<br>hearts of the gods, and with his attendant Danavas he fell upon them like<br>a lion attacking a herd of deer. And when Indra and the other celestials<br>observed that Mahisha was advancing to the charge, they fled, leaving<br>behind their arms and colours. And Mahisha was greatly enraged at this,<br>and he quickly advanced towards the chariot of Rudra; and reaching near,<br>he seized its pole with his hands. And when Mahisha in a fit of rage had<br>thus seized the chariot of Rudra, all the Earth began to groan and the<br>great Rishis lost their senses. And Daityas of huge proportions, looking<br>like dark clouds, were boisterous with joy, thinking that victory was<br>assured to them. And although that adorable god (Rudra) was in that<br>plight, yet he did not think it worth while to kill Mahisha in battle; he<br>remembered that Skanda would deal the deathblow to that evil-minded<br>Asura. And the fiery Mahisha, contemplating with satisfaction the prize<br>(the chariot of Rudra) which he had secured, sounded his war-cry, to the<br>great alarm of the gods and the joy of the Daityas. And when the gods<br>were in that fearful predicament, the mighty Mahasena, burning with<br>anger, and looking grand like the Sun advanced to their rescue. And that<br>lordly being was clad in blazing red and decked with a wreath of red<br>flowers. And cased in armour of gold he rode in a gold-coloured chariot<br>bright as the Sun and drawn by chestnut horses. And at his sight the army<br>of the daityas was suddenly dispirited on the field of battle. And, O<br>great king, the mighty Mahasena discharged a bright Sakti for the<br>destruction of Mahisha. That missile cut off the head of Mahisha, and he<br>fell upon the ground and died. And his head massive as a hillock, falling<br>on the ground, barred the entrance to the country of the Northern Kurus,<br>extending in length for sixteen Yojanas though at present the people of<br>that country pass easily by that gate.<br><br>"It was observed both by the gods and the Danavas that Skanda hurled his<br>sakti again and again on the field of battle, and that it returned to his<br>hands, after killing thousands of the enemy's forces. And the terrible<br>Danavas fell in large numbers by the arrows of the wise Mahasena. And<br>then a panic seized them, and the followers of Skanda began to slay and<br>eat them up by thousands and drink their blood. And they joyously<br>exterminated the Danavas in no time, just as the sun destroys darkness,<br>or as fire destroys a forest, or as the winds drive away the clouds. And<br>in this manner the famous Skanda defeated all his enemies. And the gods<br>came to congratulate him, and he, in turn, paid his respects to<br>Maheswara. And that son of Krittika looked grand like the sun in all the<br>glory of his effulgence. And when the enemy was completely defeated by<br>Skanda and when Maheswara left the battle-field, Purandara embraced<br>Mahasena and said to him, 'This Mahisha, who was made invincible by the<br>favour of Brahma hath been killed by thee. O best of warriors, the gods<br>were like grass to him. O strong-limbed hero, thou hast removed a thorn<br>of the celestials. Thou hast killed in battle hundreds of Danavas equal<br>in valour to Mahisha who were all hostile to us, and who used to harass<br>us before. And thy followers too have devoured them by hundreds. Thou<br>art, O mighty being, invincible in battle like Uma's lord; and this<br>victory shall be celebrated as thy first achievement, and thy fame shall<br>be undying in the three worlds. And, O strong-armed god, all the gods<br>will yield their allegiance to thee.' Having spoken thus to Mahasena, the<br>husband of Sachi left the place accompanied by the gods and with the<br>permission of the adorable three-eyed god (Siva). And Rudra returned to<br>Bhadravata, and the celestials too returned to their respective abodes.<br>And Rudra spoke, addressing the gods, 'Ye must render allegiance to<br>Skanda just as ye do unto me.' And that son of the Fire-god, having<br>killed the Danavas hath conquered the three worlds, in one day, and he<br>hath been worshipped by the great Rishis. The Brahmana who with due<br>attention readeth this story of the birth of Skanda, attaineth to great<br>prosperity in this world and the companionship of Skanda hereafter."<br><br>Yudhishthira said, "O good and adorable Brahmana, I wish to know the<br>different names of that high-souled being, by which he is celebrated<br>throughout the three worlds."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed by the Pandava in that assembly<br>of Rishis, the worshipful Markandeya of high ascetic merit replied,<br>'Agneya (Son of Agni), Skanda (Cast-off), Diptakirti (Of blazing fame),<br>Anamaya (Always hale), Mayuraketu (Peacock-bannered), Dharmatman (The<br>virtuous-souled), Bhutesa (The lord of all creatures), Mahishardana (The<br>slayer of Mahisha), Kamajit (The subjugator of desires), Kamada (The<br>fulfiller of desires), Kanta (The handsome), Satyavak (The truthful in<br>speech), Bhuvaneswara (The lord of the universe), Sisu (The child),<br>Sighra (The quick), Suchi (The pure), Chanda (The fiery), Diptavarna (The<br>bright-complexioned), Subhanana (Of beautiful face), Amogha (Incapable of<br>being baffled), Anagha (The sinless), Rudra (The terrible), Priya (The<br>favourite), Chandranana (Of face like the moon), Dipta-sasti (The wielder<br>of the blazing lance), Prasantatman (Of tranquil soul), Bhadrakrit (The<br>doer of good), Kutamahana (The chamber of even the wicked), Shashthipriya<br>(True favourite of Shashthi), Pavitra (The holy), Matrivatsala (The<br>reverencer of his mother), Kanya-bhartri (The protector of virgins),<br>Vibhakta (Diffused over the universe), Swaheya (The son of Swaha),<br>Revatisuta (The child of Revati), Prabhu (The Lord), Neta (The leader),<br>Visakha (Reared up by Visakha), Naigameya (Sprang from the Veda),<br>Suduschara (Difficult of propitiation), Suvrata (Of excellent vows),<br>Lalita (The beautiful), Valakridanaka-priya (Fond of toys), Khacharin<br>(The ranger of skies), Brahmacharin (The chaste), Sura (The brave),<br>Saravanodbhava (Born in a forest of heath), Viswamitra priya (The<br>favourite of Viswamitra), Devasena-priya (The lover of Devasena),<br>Vasudeva-priya (The beloved of Vasudeva), and Priya-krit (The doer of<br>agreeable things)&#8212;these are the divine names of Kartikeya. Whoever<br>repeateth them, undoubtedly secureth fame, wealth, and salvation."<br><br>'Markandeya continued, "O valiant scion of Kuru's race, I shall now with<br>due devotion pray to that unrivalled, mighty, six-faced, and valiant Guha<br>who is worshipped by gods and Rishis, enumerating his other titles of<br>distinction: do thou listen to them: Thou art devoted to Brahma, begotten<br>of Brahma, and versed in the mysteries of Brahma. Thou art called<br>Brahmasaya, and thou art the foremost of those who are possessed of<br>Brahma. Thou art fond of Brahma, thou art austere like the Brahmanas and<br>art versed in the great mystery of Brahma and the leader of the<br>Brahmanas. Thou art Swaha, thou art Swadha, and thou art the holiest of<br>the holy, and art invoked in hymns and celebrated as the six-flamed fire.<br>Thou art the year, thou art the six seasons, thou art the months, the<br>(lunar) half months, the (solar) declinations, and the cardinal points of<br>space. Thou art lotus-eyed. Thou art possessed of a lily-like face. Thou<br>hast a thousand faces and a thousand arms. Thou art the ruler of the<br>universe, thou art the great Oblation, and thou art the animating spirit<br>of all the gods and the Asuras. Thou art the great leader of armies. Thou<br>art Prachanda (furious), thou art the Lord, and thou art the great master<br>and the conqueror of thine enemies. Thou art, Sahasrabhu (multiform),<br>Sahasratusti (a thousand times content), Sahasrabhuk (devourer of<br>everything), and Sahasrapad (of a thousand legs), and thou art the earth<br>itself. Thou art possessed of infinite forms and thousand heads and great<br>strength. According to thine own inclinations thou hast appeared as the<br>son of Ganga, Swaha, Mahi, or Krittika. O six-faced god, thou dost play<br>with the cock and assume different forms according to thy will. Thou art<br>Daksha. Soma, the Maruta, Dharma, Vayu, the prince of mountains, and<br>Indra, for all time. Thou art mighty, the most eternal of all eternal<br>things, and the lord of all lords. Thou art the progenitor of Truth, the<br>destroyer of Diti's progeny (Asuras), and the great conqueror of the<br>enemies of the celestials. Thou art the personation of virtue and being<br>thyself vast and minute, thou art acquainted with the highest and lowest<br>points of virtuous acts, and the mysteries of Brahma. O foremost of all<br>gods and high-souled lord of the Universe, this whole creation is<br>over-spread with thy energy! I have thus prayed to thee according to the<br>best of my power. I salute thee who art possessed of twelve eyes and many<br>hands. Thy remaining attributes transcend my powers of comprehension!'<br><br>The Brahmana who with due attention readeth this story of the birth of<br>Skanda, or relateth it unto Brahmanas, or hears it narrated by regenerate<br>men, attaineth to wealth, long life, fame, children, as also victory,<br>prosperity and contentment, and the companionship of Skanda."
