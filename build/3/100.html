                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O best of regenerate ones, I desire again to hear of<br>the achievements in detail of Agastya&#8212;that illustrious Rishi endued with<br>great intelligence.'"<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'Listen now, O king, to the excellent and wonderful and<br>extraordinary history of Agastya, as also, O monarch, about the prowess<br>of that Rishi of immeasurable energy. There were in the Krita age certain<br>tribes of fierce Danavas that were invincible in battle. And they were<br>known by the name of Kalakeyas and were endued with terrible prowess.<br>Placing themselves under Vritra and arming themselves with diverse<br>weapons they pursued the celestials with Indra at their head in all<br>directions. The gods then all resolved upon the destruction of Vritra,<br>and went with Indra at their head to Brahma. And beholding them standing<br>before him with joined hands, Parameshthi addressed them all and said,<br>"Everything is known to me, ye gods, about what ye seek. I shall indicate<br>now the means by which ye may slay Vritra. There is a high-souled and<br>great Rishi known by the name of Dadhicha. Go ye all together unto him<br>and solicit of him a boon. With well-pleased heart, that Rishi of<br>virtuous soul will even grant you the boon. Desirous as ye are of<br>victory, go ye all together unto him and tell him, 'For the good of the<br>three worlds, give us thy bones.' Renouncing his body, he will give you<br>his bones. With these bones of his, make ye a fierce and powerful weapon<br>to be called Vajra, endued with six sides and terrible roar and capable<br>of destroying even the most powerful enemies. With that weapon will he of<br>a hundred sacrifices slay Vritia. I have now told you all. See that all<br>this is done speedily.' Thus addressed by him, the gods with the<br>Grandsire's leave (came away), and with Narayana at their head proceeded<br>to the asylum of Dadhicha. That asylum was on the other bank of the river<br>Saraswati and covered with diverse trees and creepers. And it resounded<br>with the hum of bees as if they were reciting Samans. And it also echoed<br>with the melodious notes of the male Kokila and the Chakora. And<br>buffaloes and boars and deer and Chamaras wandered there at pleasure<br>freed from the fear of tigers. And elephants with the juice trickling<br>down from rent temples, plunging in the stream, sported with the<br>she-elephants and made the entire region resound with their roars. And<br>the place also echoed with the loud roars of lions and tigers, while at<br>intervals might be seen those grisly monarchs of the forest lying<br>stretched in caves and glens and beautifying them with their presence And<br>such was the asylum, like unto heaven itself, of Dadhicha, that the gods<br>entered. And there they beheld Dadhicha looking like the sun himself in<br>splendour and blazing in grace of person like the Grandsire himself. And<br>the celestials saluted the feet of the Rishi and bowed unto him and<br>begged of him the boon that the Grandsire had bade them do. Then<br>Dadhicha, well pleased, addressing those foremost of celestials, said,<br>'Ye celestials, I will do what is for your benefit. I will even renounce<br>this body of mine myself.' And that foremost of men with soul under<br>control, having said this, suddenly renounced his life. The gods then<br>took the bones of the deceased Rishi as directed. And the celestials,<br>glad at heart, went to Twashtri (the celestial Artificer) and spake to<br>him of the means of victory. And Twashtri, hearing those words of theirs,<br>became filled with joy, and constructed (out of those bones) with great<br>attention and care the fierce weapons called Vajra. And having<br>manufactured it, he joyfully addressed Indra, saying, 'With this foremost<br>of weapons, O exalted one, reduce that fierce foe of the gods to ashes.<br>And having slain the foe, rule thou happily the entire domain of heaven,<br>O chief of the celestials, with those that follow thee.' And thus<br>addressed by Twashtri, Purandara took the Vajra from his hand, joyfully<br>and with proper respect."
