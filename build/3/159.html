                            Janamejaya said, "How long did my great grandsires, the highsouled sons<br>of Pandu of matchless prowess, dwell in the Gandhamadana mountain? And<br>what did those exceedingly powerful ones, gifted with manliness, do? And<br>what was the food of those high-souled ones, when those heroes of the<br>worlds dwelt (there)? O excellent one, do thou relate all about this. Do<br>thou describe the prowess of Bhimasena, and what that mighty-armed one<br>did in the mountain Himalayan. Surely, O best of Brahmanas, he did not<br>fight again with the Yakshas. And did they meet with Vaisravana? Surely,<br>as Arshtishena said, the lord of wealth cometh thither. All this, O thou<br>of ascetic wealth, I desire to hear in detail. Surely, I have not yet<br>been fully satisfied by hearing about their acts."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having heard from that one of incomparable<br>energy, (Arshtishena), that advice conducive to their welfare, those<br>foremost of the Bharatas, began to behave always accordingly. Those best<br>of men, the Pandavas, dwelt upon the Himavan, partaking of the food eaten<br>by the Munis, and luscious fruit, and the flesh of deer killed with<br>unpoisoned shafts and various kinds of pure honey. Living thus, they<br>passed the fifth year, hearing to various stories told by Lomasa. O lord,<br>saying, 'I shall be present when occasion ariseth,' Ghatotkacha, together<br>with all the Rakshasas, had ere this already gone away. Those magnanimous<br>ones passed many months in the hermitage of Arshtishena, witnessing many<br>marvels. And as the Pandavas were sporting there pleasantly, there came<br>to see them some complacent vow-observing Munis and Charanas of high<br>fortune, and pure souls. And those foremost of the Bharata race conversed<br>with them on earthly topics. And it came to pass that when several days<br>has passed, Suparna all of a sudden carried off an exceedingly powerful<br>and mighty Naga, living in the large lake. And thereupon that mighty<br>mountain began to tremble, and the gigantic trees, break. And all the<br>creatures and the Pandavas witnessed the wonder. Then from the brow of<br>that excellent mountain, the wind brought before the Pandavas various<br>fragrant and fair blossoms. And the Pandavas, and the illustrious<br>Krishna, together with their friends, saw those unearthly blossoms of<br>five hues. And as the mighty-armed Bhimasena was seated at ease upon the<br>mountain, Krishna addressed him, saying, 'O best of the Bharata race, in<br>the presence of all the creatures, these flowers of five hues, carried by<br>the force of the wind raised by Suparna, are falling in amain on the<br>river Aswaratha. In Khandava thy high-souled brother, firm in promise,<br>had baffled Gandharvas and Nagas and Vasava himself, and slain fierce<br>Rakshasas, and also obtained the bow Gandiva. Thou also art of exceeding<br>prowess and the might of thy arms is great, and irrepressible, and<br>unbearable like unto the might of Sakra. O Bhimasena, terrified with the<br>force of thy arms, let all the Rakshasas betake themselves to the ten<br>cardinal points, leaving the mountain. Then will thy friends be freed<br>from fear and affliction, and behold the auspicious summit of this<br>excellent mountain furnished with variegated flowers. O Bhima, I have for<br>long cherished this thought in my mind,&#8212;that protected by the might of<br>thy arms, I shall see that summit.'<br><br>"Thereupon, like a high-mettled bull that hath been struck, Bhimasena,<br>considering himself as censured by Draupadi, could not bear (that). And<br>that Pandava of the gait of a lion or a bull, and graceful, and generous,<br>and having the splendour of gold, and intelligent, and strong, and proud,<br>and sensitive, and heroic, and having red eyes, and broad shoulders, and<br>gifted with the strength of mad elephants, and having leonine teeth and a<br>broad neck, and tall like a young sala tree, and highsouled, and graceful<br>in every limb, and of neck having the whorls of a shell and mighty-armed,<br>took up his bow plaited at the back with gold, and also his sword. And<br>haughty like unto a lion, and resembling a maddened elephant, that strong<br>one rushed towards that cliff, free from fear or affliction. And all the<br>creatures saw him equipped with bows and arrows, approaching like a lion<br>or a maddened elephant. And free from fear or affliction, the Pandava<br>taking his mace, proceeded to that monarch of mountains causing the<br>delight of Draupadi. And neither exhaustion, nor fatigue, nor lassitude,<br>nor the malice (of others), affected that son of Pritha and the Wind-god.<br>And having arrived at a rugged path affording passage to one individual<br>only, that one of great strength ascended that terrible summit high as<br>several palmyra palms (placed one upon another). And having ascended that<br>summit, and thereby gladdened Kinnaras, and great Nagas, and Munis, and<br>Gandharvas, and Rakshasas, that foremost of the Bharata line, gifted with<br>exceeding strength described the abode of Vaisravana, adorned with golden<br>crystal palaces surrounded on all sides by golden walls having the<br>splendour of all gems, furnished with gardens all around, higher than a<br>mountain peak, beautiful with ramparts and towers, and adorned with<br>door-ways and gates and rows of pennons. And the abode was graced with<br>dallying damsels dancing around, and also with pennons waved by the<br>breeze. And with bent arms, supporting himself on the end of his bow, he<br>stood beholding with eagerness the city of the lord of treasures. And<br>gladdening all creatures, there was blowing a breeze, carrying all<br>perfumes, and of a balmy feel. And there were various beautiful and<br>wonderful trees of diverse hues resounding with diverse dulcet notes. And<br>at that place the foremost of the Bharatas surveyed the palace of the<br>Lord of the Rakshasas scattered with heaps of gems, and adorned with<br>variegated garlands. And renouncing all care of life the mighty-armed<br>Bhimasena stood motionless like a rock, with his mace and sword and bow<br>in his hands. Then he blew his shell making the down of his adversaries<br>stand erect; and twanging his bow-string, and striking his arms with the<br>hands he unnerved all the creatures. Thereat with their hairs standing<br>erect, the Yakshas and Rakshasas began to rush towards the Pandavas, in<br>the direction of those sounds. And taken by the arms of the Yakshas and<br>Rakshasas the flamed maces and clubs and swords and spears and javelins<br>and axes, and when, O Bharata, the fight ensued between the Rakshasas and<br>Bhima, the latter by arrows cut off the darts, javelins and axes of those<br>possessing great powers of illusion, and he of exceeding strength with<br>arrows pierced the bodies of the roaring Rakshasas, both of those that<br>were in the sky, and of those that remained on the earth. And Bhima of<br>exceeding strength was deluged with the mighty sanguine rain sprung from<br>the bodies of the Rakshasas with maces and clubs in their hands and<br>flowing on all sides from their persons. And the bodies and hands of the<br>Yakshas and Rakshasas were seen to be struck off by the weapon discharged<br>by the might of Bhima's arms. And then all the creatures saw the graceful<br>Pandava densely surrounded by the Rakshasas, like unto the Sun enveloped<br>by clouds. And even as the Sun surrounds everything with his rays, that<br>mighty-armed and strong one of unfailing prowess, covered all with arrows<br>destroying foes. And although menacing and uttering yells, the Rakshasas<br>did not see Bhima embarrassed. Thereupon, with their bodies mangled, the<br>Yakshas afflicted by fear, Bhimasena began to utter frightful sounds of<br>distress, throwing their mighty weapons. And terrified at the wielder of<br>a strong bow, they fled towards the southern quarter, forsaking their<br>maces and spears and swords and clubs and axes. And then there stood,<br>holding in his hands darts and maces, the broad-chested and mighty-armed<br>friend of Vaisravana, the Rakshasa named Maniman. And that one of great<br>strength began to display his mastery and manliness. And seeing them<br>forsake the fight, he addressed them with a smile, 'Going to Vaisravana's<br>abode, how will ye say unto that lord of wealth, that numbers have been<br>defeated by a single mortal in battle?' Having said this unto them that<br>Rakshasa, taking in his hands clubs and javelins and maces, set out and<br>rushed towards the Pandava. And he rushed in amain like a maddened<br>elephant. Bhimasena pierced his sides with three choice arrows. And the<br>mighty Maniman, on his part, in wrath taking and flourishing a tremendous<br>mace hurled it at Bhimasena. Thereupon Bhimasena beset with innumerable<br>shafts sharpened on stones, hurled that mighty mace in the sky, dreadful,<br>and like unto the lightning flash. But on reaching the mace those shafts<br>were baffled; and although discharged with force by that adept at hurling<br>the mace, still they could not stay its career. Then the mighty Bhima of<br>dreadful prowess, baffled his (the Rakshasa's) discharge by resorting to<br>his skill in mace-fighting. In the meanwhile, the intelligent Rakshasa<br>had discharged a terrible iron club, furnished with a golden shaft. And<br>that club, belching forth flames and emitting tremendous roars, all of a<br>sudden pierced Bhima's right arm and then fell to the ground. On being<br>severely wounded by that club, that bowman, Kunti's son, of immeasurable<br>prowess, with eyes rolling in ire, took up his mace. And having taken<br>that iron mace, inlaid with golden plates, which caused the fear of foes<br>and brought on their defeat, he darted it with speed towards the mighty<br>Maniman, menacing (him) and uttering shouts. Then Maniman on his part,<br>taking his huge and blazing dart, with great force discharged it at<br>Bhima, uttering loud shouts. Thereat breaking the dart with the end of<br>his mace, that mighty-armed one skilled in mace-fighting, speedily rushed<br>to slay him, as Garuda (rushed) to slay a serpent. Then all of a sudden,<br>advancing ahead in the field, that mighty-armed one sprang into the sky<br>and brandishing his mace hurled it with shouts. And like unto the<br>thunder-bolt hurled by Indra, that mace like a pest, with the speed of<br>the wind destroyed the Rakshasa and then fell to the ground. Then all the<br>creatures saw that Rakshasa of terrible strength slaughtered by Bhima,<br>even like a bull slain by a lion. And the surviving Rakshasas seeing him<br>slain on the ground went towards the east, uttering frightful sounds of<br>distress.'"
