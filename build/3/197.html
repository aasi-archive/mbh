                            Vaisampayana said, "And the son of Pandu once more addressed Markandeya,<br>saying, 'Tell us again of the great good fortune of kings.' And<br>Markandeya said, 'There came unto the horse-sacrifice of king Ashtaka of<br>Viswamitra's race, many kings. And there came unto that sacrifice the<br>three brothers also of that king, viz., Pratardana, Vasumanas, and Sivi,<br>the son of Usinara. And after the sacrifice was completed, Ashtaka was<br>proceeding on his car along with his brothers when they all beheld Narada<br>coming that way and they saluted the celestial Rishi and said unto him,<br>'Ride thou on this car with us. And Narada, saying, So be it, mounted on<br>the car, and one among those kings having gratified the holy and<br>celestial Rishi Narada, said, O Holy One, I desire, to ask thee<br>something.' And the Rishi said, 'Ask.' And the person, thus permitted,<br>said, 'All four of us are blessed with long lives and have indeed every<br>virtue. We shall, therefore, be permitted to go to a certain heaven and<br>dwell there for a long period. Who amongst us, however, O king, shall<br>fall down first?' Thus questioned the Rishi said, 'This Ashtaka shall<br>first come down.' And thereupon the enquirer asked, 'For what cause?' And<br>the Rishi answered, 'I lived for a few days in the abode of Ashtaka. He<br>carried me (one day) on his car out of the town and there I beheld<br>thousands of kine distinguished from one another by difference of hue.<br>And beholding those kine I asked Ashtaka whose they were and Ashtaka<br>answered me, saying, 'I have given away these kine. By this answer he<br>gave expression to his own praise. It is for this answer of his that<br>Ashtaka shall have to come down.' And after Narada had said so, one of<br>them again enquired, saying, 'Three of us then will stay in heaven.<br>Amongst us three, who shall fall down first?' And the Rishi answered,<br>Pratardana.' And the enquirer asked, 'For what cause?' And the Rishi<br>answered, 'I lived for some days in the abode of Pratardana also. And he<br>carried me on his car one day. And while doing so, a Brahmana asked him<br>saying, 'Give me a horse!' And Pratardana replied, 'After returning, I<br>will give thee one!' And thereupon the Brahmana said, 'Let it be given to<br>me soon.' And as the Brahmana spoke those words, the king gave unto him<br>the steed that had been yoked on the right-hand wheel of the car. And<br>there came unto him another Brahmana desirous of obtaining a steed. And<br>the king having spoken to him in the same way, gave him the steed that<br>had been yoked on the left wheel of his car. And having given away the<br>horse unto him, the king proceeded on his journey. And then there came<br>unto the king another Brahmana desirous of obtaining a horse. And the<br>king soon gave him the horse on the left front of his car, unyoking the<br>animal. And having done so, the king proceeded on his journey. And then<br>there came unto the king another Brahmana desirous of obtaining a horse.<br>And the king said unto him, 'Returning, I will give thee a horse.' But<br>the Brahmana said, 'Let the steed be given to me soon.' And the king gave<br>him the only horse he had. And seizing the yoke of the car himself, the<br>king began to draw it. And as he did so, he said, 'There is now nothing<br>for the Brahmanas.' The king had given away, it is true, but he had done<br>so with detraction. And for that speech of his, he shall have to fall<br>down from heaven. And after the Rishi had said so, of the two that<br>remained, one asked, 'Who amongst us two shall fall down?' And the Rishi<br>answered, 'Vasumanas.' And the enquirer asked, 'For what reason?' And<br>Narada said, 'In course of my wanderings I arrived at the abode of<br>Vasumanas. And at that time the Brahmanas were performing the ceremony of<br>Swastivachana for the sake of a flowery car.[51] And I approached the<br>king's presence. And after the Brahmanas had completed the ceremony, the<br>flowery car became visible to them. And I praised that car, and thereupon<br>the king told me, 'Holy one, by thee hath this car been praised. Let this<br>car, therefore, be thine.' And after this I went to Vasumanas another<br>time when I was in need of a (flowery) car. And I admired the car, and<br>the king said, 'It is thine.' And I went to the king a third time and<br>admired the car again. And even then the king exhibiting the flowery car<br>to the Brahmanas, cast his eyes on me, and said, 'O holy one, thou hast<br>praised the flowery car sufficiently." And the king only said these<br>words, without making me a gift of that car. And for this he will fall<br>down from heaven.'<br><br>"And one among them said, 'Of the one who is to go with thee, who will go<br>and who will fall down?' And Narada answered, saying, 'Sivi will go, but<br>I will fall down.' 'For what reason?' asked the enquirer. And Narada<br>said, 'I am not the equal of Sivi. For one day a Brahmana came unto Sivi<br>and addressing him, said, 'O Sivi, I came to thee for food.' And Sivi<br>replied unto him, saying. 'What shall I do? Let me have thy orders.' And<br>the Brahmana answered, 'This thy son known by the name of Vrihadgarbha<br>should be killed. And, O king, cook him for my food.' And hearing this, I<br>waited to see what would follow. And Sivi then killed his son and cooking<br>him duly and placing that food in a vessel and taking it upon his head,<br>he went out in search of the Brahmana and while Sivi was thus seeking,<br>for the Brahmana, some one told him, The Brahmana thou seekest, having<br>entered thy city, is setting fire to thy abode and he is also setting<br>fire, in wrath, to thy treasury, thy arsenal, the apartments of the<br>females and thy stables for horses and elephants.' And Sivi heard all<br>this, without change of colour, and entering his city spoke unto the<br>Brahmana, 'O holy one, the food has been cooked.' And the Brahmana<br>hearing this spoke not a word and from surprise he stood with downcast<br>looks. And Sivi with a view to gratifying the Brahmana said, 'O holy one,<br>eat thou this.' And the Brahmana looking at Sivi for a moment said, 'Eat<br>it thyself.' And thereupon Sivi said, 'Let it be so.' And Sivi cheerfully<br>taking the vessel from his head desired to eat it and thereupon the<br>Brahmana caught hold of Sivi's hand and addressing him said, 'Thou hast<br>conquered wrath. There is nothing that thou canst not give unto the<br>Brahmanas.' And saying this, that Brahmana adored Sivi, and then as Sivi<br>cast his eyes before him, he beheld his son standing like a child of the<br>gods, decked in ornaments and yielding a fragrance from his body and the<br>Brahmana, having accomplished all this, made himself visible and it was<br>Vidhatri himself who had thus come in that guise to try that royal sage,<br>and after Vidhatri had disappeared, the counsellors addressed the king,<br>saying, 'Thou knowest everything. For what didst thou do all this?' And<br>Sivi answered, 'It was not for fame, nor for wealth, nor from desire of<br>acquiring objects of enjoyment that I did all this. This course is not<br>sinful. It is for this that I do all this. The path which is trodden by<br>the virtuous is laudable. My heart always inclineth towards such a<br>course. This high instance of Sivi's blessedness I know, and I have,<br>therefore, narrated it duly!'"
