                            "Vaisampayana said, 'O king, after Vidura had gone to the abode of the<br>Pandavas, Dhritarashtra, O Bharata, of profound wisdom, repented of his<br>action. And thinking of the great intelligence of Vidura in matters<br>connected with both war and peace, and also of the aggrandisement of the<br>Pandavas in the future, Dhritarashtra, pained at the recollection of<br>Vidura, having approached the door of the hall of state fell down<br>senseless in the presence of the monarchs (in waiting) And regaining<br>consciousness, the king rose from the ground and thus addressed Sanjaya<br>standing by, 'My brother and friend is even like the god of justice<br>himself! Recollecting him today, my heart burneth in grief! Go, bring<br>unto me without delay my brother well-versed in morality!' Saying this,<br>the monarch wept bitterly. And burning in repentance, and overwhelmed<br>with sorrow at the recollection of Vidura, the king, from brotherly<br>affection, again addressed Sanjaya saying, 'O Sanjaya, go thou and<br>ascertain whether my brother, expelled by my wretched self through anger,<br>liveth still! That wise brother of mine of immeasurable intelligence hath<br>never been guilty of even the slightest transgression, but, on the other<br>hand, he it is who hath come by grievous wrong at my hands! Seek him, O<br>wise one, and bring him hither; else, O Sanjaya, I will lay down my life!"<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of the king, Sanjaya<br>expressed his approbation, and saying 'So be it,' went in the direction<br>of the Kamyaka woods. And arriving without loss of time at the forest<br>where the sons of Pandu dwelt, he beheld Yudhishthira clad in deer-skin,<br>seated with Vidura, in the midst of Brahmanas by thousands and guarded by<br>his brothers, even like Purandara in the midst of the celestials! And<br>approaching Yudhishthira, Sanjaya worshipped him duly and was received<br>with due respect by Bhima and Arjuna and the twins. And Yudhishthira made<br>the usual enquiries about his welfare and when he had been seated at his<br>ease, he disclosed the reason of his visit, in these words, 'King<br>Dhritarashtra, the son of Amvika, hath, O Kshatta! remembered thee!<br>Returning unto him without loss of time, do thou revive the king! And, O<br>thou best of men, with the permission of these Kuru princes&#8212;these<br>foremost of men&#8212;it behoveth thee, at the command of that lion among<br>kings, to return unto him!<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by Sanjaya, the intelligent<br>Vidura, ever attached to his relatives, with the permission of<br>Yudhishthira returned to the city named after the elephant. And after he<br>had approached the king, Dhritarashtra of great energy, the son of<br>Amvika, addressed him, saying, 'From my good luck alone, O Vidura, thou,<br>O sinless one, of conversant with morality, hast come here remembering<br>me! And, O thou bull of the Bharata race, in thy absence I was beholding<br>myself, sleepless through the day and the night, as one that hath been<br>lost on earth!' And the king then took Vidura on his lap and smelt his<br>head, and said, 'Forgive me, O sinless one, the words in which thou wert<br>addressed by me!' And Vidura said, 'O king, I have forgiven thee. Thou<br>art my superior, worthy of the highest reverence! Here am I, having come<br>back, eagerly wishing to behold thee! All virtuous men, O tiger among<br>men, are (instinctively) partial towards those that are distressed! This,<br>O king, is scarcely the result of deliberation! (My partiality to the<br>Pandavas proceedeth from this cause)! O Bharata, thy sons are as dear to<br>me as the sons of Pandu, but as the latter are now in distress, my heart<br>yearneth after them!<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'And addressing each other thus in apologetic<br>speeches, the two illustrious brothers, Vidura and Dhritarashtra, felt<br>themselves greatly happy!'"
