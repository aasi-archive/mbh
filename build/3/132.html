                            "Lomasa said, 'See here, O lord of men, the sacred hermitage of<br>Swetaketu, son of Uddalaka, whose fame as an expert in the sacred mantras<br>is so widely spread on earth. This hermitage is graced with cocoanut<br>trees. Here Swetaketu beheld the goddess Saraswati in her human shape,<br>and spake unto her, saying, 'May I be endowed with the gift of speech!"<br>In that yuga, Swetaketu, the son of Uddalaka, and Ashtavakra, the son of<br>Kahoda, who stood to each other in the relation of uncle and nephew, were<br>the best of those conversant with the sacred lore. Those two Brahmanas,<br>of matchless energy, who bore unto each other the relationship of uncle<br>and nephew, went into the sacrificial ground of king Janaka and there<br>defeated Vandin in a controversy. Worship, O son of Kunti, with thy<br>brothers, the sacred hermitage of him who had for his grandson<br>Ashtavakra, who, even when a mere child, had caused Vandin to be drowned<br>in a river, after having defeated him in a (literary) contest.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, Tell me, O Lomasa, all about the power of this man,<br>who had in that way defeated Vandin. Why was he born as Ashtavakra<br>(crooked in eight parts in his body)?"<br><br>"Lomasa said, The sage Uddalaka had a disciple named Kahoda of subdued<br>passions, and entirely devoted to the service of his preceptor and who<br>had continued his studies long. The Brahmana had served his tutor long,<br>and his preceptor, recognising his service, gave him his own daughter,<br>Sujata, in marriage, as well as a mastery over the Shastras. And she<br>became with child, radiant as fire. And the embryo addressed his father<br>while employed in reading, 'O father, thou hast been reading the whole<br>night, but (of all that) thy reading doth not seem to me correct. Even in<br>my fetal state I have, by thy favour, become versed in the Shastras and<br>the Vedas with their several branches. I say, O father, that what<br>proceeds from thy mouth, is not correct.' Thus insulted in the presence<br>of his disciples, the great sage in anger cursed his child in the womb,<br>saying, 'Because thou speakest thus even while in the womb, therefore<br>thou shalt be crooked in eight parts of the body.' The child was<br>accordingly born crooked, and the great sage was ever after known by the<br>name of Ashtavakra. Now, he had an uncle named Swetaketu who was the same<br>age with himself. Afflicted by the growth of the child in the womb,<br>Sujata, desirous of riches, conciliating her husband who had no wealth<br>told him in private: 'How shall I manage, O great sage, the tenth month<br>of my pregnancy having come? Thou hast no substance whereby I may<br>extricate myself from the exigencies, after I have been delivered." Thus<br>addressed by his wife, Kahoda went unto king Janaka for riches. He was<br>there defeated in a controversy by Vandin, well versed in the science of<br>arguments, and (in consequence) was immersed into water. And hearing that<br>his son-in-law had been defeated in a controversy by Vandin and caused to<br>be drowned by him, Uddalaka spake unto his daughter Sujata, saying, 'Thou<br>shall keep it a secret from Ashtavakra.' She accordingly kept her<br>counsel&#8212;so that Ashtavakra, when born, had heard nothing about the<br>matter. And he regarded Uddalaka as his father and Swetaketu as his<br>brother. And when Ashtavakra was in his twelfth year, Swetaketu one day<br>saw the former seated on his father's lap. And thereat he pulled him by<br>the hand, and on Ashtavakra's beginning to cry, he told him, 'It is not<br>the lap of thy father.' This cruel communication went direct into<br>Ashtavakra's heart and it pained him sorely. And he went home and asked<br>his mother saying, 'Where is my father?' Thereupon Sujata who was greatly<br>afflicted (by his question), and apprehending a curse told him all that<br>had happened. And having heard all, the Brahmana at night said unto his<br>uncle Swetaketu, 'Let us go unto the sacrifice of king Janaka, wherein<br>many wonderful things are to be seen. There we shall listen to the<br>controversy between the Brahmanas and shall partake of excellent food.<br>Our knowledge also will increase. The recitation of the sacred Vedas is<br>sweet to hear and is fraught with blessings.' Then they both&#8212;uncle and<br>nephew&#8212;went unto the splendid sacrifice of king Janaka. And on being<br>driven from the entrance, Ashtavakra met the king and addressed him in<br>the following words."
