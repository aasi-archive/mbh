                            "Vrihadaswa said, 'After the festivities had commenced in the city that<br>was full of joy and without anxiety of any kind, the king with a large<br>force brought Damayanti (from her father's home). And her father, too,<br>that slayer of hostile heroes, Bhima of terrible prowess and immeasurable<br>soul, sent his daughter, having honoured her duly. And upon the arrival<br>of the princess of Vidarbha accompanied by her son and daughter, king<br>Nala began to pass his days in joy like the chief of the celestials in<br>the gardens of Nandana. And the king of undying fame, having regained his<br>kingdom and becoming illustrious among monarchs of the island of Jamvu,<br>began once more to rule it. And he duly performed numerous sacrifices<br>with abundant gifts to Brahmanas. O great king, thou also wilt with thy<br>kindred and relatives, so blaze forth in effulgence soon. For, O foremost<br>of men, it was thus that subjugator of hostile cities, king Nala, had<br>fallen into distress along with his wife, in consequence, O bull of<br>Bharata race of dice. And, O lord of the earth, Nala suffered such dire<br>woe all alone and recovered his prosperity, whereas thou, O son of Pandu,<br>with heart fixed on virtue, art sporting in joy in this great forest,<br>accompanied by thy brothers and Krishna. When thou art also, O monarch,<br>mixing daily with blessed Brahmanas versed in the Vedas and their<br>branches, thou hast little cause for sorrow. This history, besides, of<br>the Naga Karkotaka, of Damayanti, of Nala and of that royal sage<br>Rituparna, is destructive of evil. And, O thou of unfading glory, this<br>history, destructive of the influence of Kali, is capable, O king, of<br>comforting persons like thee when they listen to it. And reflecting upon<br>the uncertainty (of success) of human exertion, it behoveth thee not to<br>joy or grieve at prosperity or adversity. Having listened to this<br>history, be comforted, O king, and yield not to grief. It behoveth thee<br>not, O great king, to pine under calamity. Indeed, men of<br>self-possession, reflecting upon the caprice of destiny and the<br>fruitlessness of exertion, never suffer themselves to be depressed. They<br>that will repeatedly recite this noble history of Nala, and that will<br>hear it recited, will never be touched by adversity. He that listeneth to<br>this old and excellent history hath all his purposes crowned with success<br>and, without doubt, obtaineth fame, besides sons and grandsons and<br>animals, a high position among men, and health, and joy. And, O king, the<br>fear also that thou entertainest, viz., (Some one skilled in dice will<br>summon me), I will for once dispel. O thou of invincible prowess, I know<br>the science of dice in its entirety. I am gratified with thee; take this<br>lore, O son of Kunti, I will tell unto thee.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "King Yudhishthira then, with a glad heart, said<br>unto Vrihadaswa, 'O illustrious one, I desire to learn the science of<br>dice from thee.' The Rishi then gave his dice-lore unto the high-souled<br>son of Pandu, and having given it unto him, that great ascetic went to<br>the sacred waters of Hayasirsha for a bath.<br><br>"And after Vrihadaswa had gone away, Yudhishthira of firm vows heard from<br>Brahmanas and ascetics that came to him from various directions and from<br>places of pilgrimage and mountains and forests that Arjuna of high<br>intelligence and capable of drawing the bow with his left hand, was still<br>engaged in the austerest of ascetic penances, living upon air alone. And<br>he heard that the mighty-armed Partha was engaged in such fierce<br>asceticism that none else before him had ever been engaged in such<br>penances. And Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, engaged in ascetic<br>austerities with regulated vows and fixed mind and observing the vow of<br>perfect silence, was, he heard, like the blazing god of justice himself<br>in his embodied form. And, O king, (Yudhishthira) the son of Pandu<br>hearing that his dear brother Jaya, the son of Kunti, was engaged in such<br>asceticism in the great forest, began to grieve for him. And with a heart<br>burning in grief, the eldest son of Pandu, seeking consolation in that<br>mighty forest held converse with the Brahmanas possessed of various<br>knowledge who were living with him there."
