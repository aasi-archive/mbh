                            Markandeya said, "O king, after the death of Ikshvaku, a highly virtuous<br>king of the name of Sasada, ascending the throne of Ayodhya ruled this<br>earth. And from Sasada was descended Kakutstha of great energy. And<br>Kakutshta had a son of name Anenas. And Anenas had a son named Prithu and<br>Prithu had a son named Viswagaswa and from Viswagaswa sprang Adri and<br>from Adri sprang Yuvanaswa and from Yuvanaswa sprang Sravastha and it was<br>by this Sravastha that the city called Sravasthi was built and from<br>Sravastha was descended Vrihadaswa and from Vrihadaswa sprang Kuvalaswa<br>and Kuvalaswa had twentyone thousand sons and all these sons were fierce<br>and powerful and skilled in learning. And Kuvalaswa excelled his father<br>in every quality. And when the time came, his father Vrihadaswa installed<br>him&#8212;the brave and highly virtuous Kuvalaswa&#8212;on the throne. And having<br>thus made over the royal dignity to his son, that slayer of foes&#8212;king<br>Vrihadaswa of great intelligence&#8212;retired into the woods for asceticism."<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'O king, when the royal sage Vrihadaswa was about<br>to retire into the woods, that best of Brahmanas, Utanka heard of it. And<br>Utanka who was possessed of great energy and immeasurable soul,<br>approached that foremost of all wielders of weapons and best of men. And<br>approaching him, the Rishis began to persuade him to give up asceticism.<br>And Utanka said, 'O king, to protect (the people) is thy duty. It<br>behoveth thee to do that duty of thine. Let us be free from all anxiety<br>through thy grace. Possessed as thou art of a great soul, protected by<br>thee, the earth will be freed from all dangers. Therefore, it behoveth<br>thee, not to retire into the woods. Great merit attaches to the act of<br>protecting people in this world. Such merit can never be acquired in the<br>woods. Let not thy heart, therefore, turn to this course. The merit,<br>great king, that was acquired in days of old by great royal sages by<br>protecting their subjects was so great that nothing equal to it could be<br>seen. The king should always protect his subjects. It behoveth thee,<br>therefore, to protect thy people. O lord of the earth, I cannot (at<br>present) perform my ascetic devotions peacefully. Close to my asylum<br>there is a sea of sands known by the name of Ujjalaka. And it occupies a<br>level country and is without any water. And it extends many yojanas in<br>length and breadth and in that desert dwells a chief of the Danavas<br>called Dhundhu by name. And Dhundhu is the son of Madhu and Kaitabha, and<br>is fierce and terrible and possessed of great prowess. And endued with<br>immeasurable energy, that Danava, O king, dwelleth under the ground, and,<br>O king, it behoveth thee to retire into the woods, having first slain<br>that Asura. That Asura is now lying still in the observance of an ascetic<br>penance of great austerity and, O king, the object he hath in view is<br>sovereignty over the celestials as also of the three worlds. And, O king,<br>having, obtained a boon from the Grandsire of all creatures, that Asura<br>hath become incapable of being slain by the gods and Daityas and<br>Rakshasas and Gandharvas. Slay though him, O king, and blessed be thou<br>and let not thy heart turn to any other course. By slaying him thou wilt<br>without doubt, achieve a great thing and thou wilt also obtain eternal<br>and undying fame. And O king, when at the end of every year that wicked<br>Asura lying covered with sands, wakes up and begins to breathe, then the<br>whole earth with her mountains, forests and woods begins to tremble. And<br>his breath raiseth up clouds of sands, and shroudeth the very sun, and<br>for seven days continually the earth tremble all over, and sparks and<br>flames of fire mixed with smoke spread far around and for all this, O<br>king, I cannot rest in peace in my asylum. Slay thou him, O king, for the<br>good of the world. Indeed, when that Asura is slain the triple world will<br>be in peace and happiness. That thou art competent, O king, to slay that<br>Asura, I fully believe. Thy energy will be enhanced by Vishnu with the<br>addition of his own. In days of old, O king, Vishnu gave this boon that<br>the king who should slay this fierce and great Asura would be pervaded by<br>the invincible energy of Vishnu himself. Bearing that invincible<br>Vaishnava energy in thyself, slay thou, O great king, that Daitya of<br>fierce prowess. Possessed as Dhundhu is of mighty energy, no one, O king,<br>that is endued with small energy himself will be capable of consuming<br>him, even if he were to strive for a hundred years.'"
