                            Vaisampayana said, "Hearing the words of Yudhishthira, those bulls among<br>men, headed by Bhimasena, rose up with faces beaming in joy. And those<br>mighty warriors, O Bharata, then began to case themselves in impenetrable<br>mail that were besides variegated with pure gold, and armed themselves<br>with celestial weapons of various kinds. And the Pandavas thus cased in<br>mail, and mounted on those chariots furnished with flagstaffs and armed<br>with bows and arrows, looked like blazing fires. And those tigers among<br>warriors, riding upon those well furnished cars drawn by fleet horses,<br>proceeded to that spot without losing a moment. And beholding those<br>mighty warriors&#8212;the sons of Pandu&#8212;thus proceeding together (for the<br>liberation of Duryodhana), the Kuru army sent forth a loud shout. And<br>soon did those rangers of the sky flushed with victory, and those<br>impetuous warriors, the sons of Pandu, fearlessly encounter each other in<br>that forest. The Gandharvas were flushed with success, and beholding the<br>four brave sons of Pandu coming to battle seated on their cars, they all<br>turned back towards the advancing combatants. And, the dwellers of the<br>Gandhamadana, beholding the Pandavas looking like blazing guardians of<br>the world provoked to ire, stood arrayed in order of battle. And, O<br>Bharata, in accordance with words of king Yudhishthira of great wisdom,<br>the encounter that took place was a skirmish. But when Arjuna&#8212;that<br>persecutor of foes&#8212;saw that the foolish soldiers of the king of<br>Gandharvas could not be made to understand what was good for them by<br>means of a light skirmish, he addressed those invincible rangers of the<br>skies in a conciliatory tone and said, 'Leave ye my brother king<br>Suyodhana.' Thus addressed by the illustrious son of Pandu, the<br>Gandharvas, laughing aloud, replied unto him saying, 'O child, there is<br>but one in the world whose behests we obey and living under whose rule we<br>pass our days in happiness: O Bharata, we always act as that one only<br>person commandeth us! Besides that celestial chief there is none that can<br>command us!' Thus addressed by the Gandharvas, Dhananjaya, the son of<br>Kunti, replied unto them, saying, 'This contact with other people's wives<br>and this hostile encounter with human beings are acts that are both<br>censurable in the king of the Gandharvas and not proper for him.<br>Therefore, leave ye these sons of Dhritarashtra all endued with mighty<br>energy. And liberate ye also these ladies, at the command of king<br>Yudhishthira the just. If, ye Gandharvas, ye do not set the sons of<br>Dhritarashtra free peacefully, I shall certainly rescue Suyodhana (and<br>his party) by exerting my prowess.' And speaking unto them thus, Pritha's<br>son, Dhananjaya, capable of wielding the bow with his left hand also,<br>then rained a shower of sharp pointed sky-ranging shafts upon those<br>rangers of the firmament. Thus attacked, the mighty Gandharvas then<br>encountered the sons of Pandu with a shower of arrows equally thick, and<br>the Pandavas also replied by attacking those dwellers of heaven. And the<br>battle then, O Bharata, that ranged between the active and agile<br>Gandharvas and the impetuous son of Pandu was fierce in the extreme."
