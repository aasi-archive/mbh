                            "Sanjaya said, 'That which hath been uttered by thee, O king, with<br>respect to Duryodhana is all true. Nothing that thou hast said, O lord of<br>the earth, is untrue. The Pandavas of immeasurable energy have been<br>filled with rage at the sight of Krishna their wedded wife of pure<br>fame&#8212;brought in the midst of the assembly. Hearing also those cruel<br>words of Dussasana and Karna, they have been so incensed, O king, that<br>they will not, I ween, forgive (the Kurus) on my account. I have heard, O<br>king, how Arjuna hath gratified in battle by means of his bow the god of<br>gods&#8212;Sthanu of eleven forms. The illustrious lord of all the<br>gods&#8212;Kapardin himself&#8212;desirous of testing Phalguna, fought with him,<br>having assumed the guise of a Kirata. And there it was that the Lokapala,<br>in order to give away their weapons unto that bull of the Kuru race,<br>showed themselves unto him of undeteriorating prowess. What other man on<br>earth, except Phalguna, would strive to have a sight of these gods in<br>their own forms? And, O king, who is there that will weaken in battle<br>Arjuna, who could not be weakened by Maheswara himself possessed of eight<br>forms? Thy sons, having dragged Draupadi, and thereby incensed the sons<br>of Pandu, have brought this frightful and horrifying calamity upon<br>themselves. Beholding Duryodhana showing both his thighs unto Draupadi,<br>Bhima said with quivering lips, 'wretch! those thighs of thine will I<br>smash with my fierce descending mace, on the expiration of thirteen<br>years.' All the sons of Pandu are the foremost of smiters; all of them<br>are of immeasurable energy; all of them are well-versed in every kind of<br>weapons. For these, they are incapable of being vanquished even by the<br>gods. Incensed at the insult offered to their wedded wife, Pritha's sons,<br>urged by wrath, will, I ween, slay all thy sons in battle.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'O charioteer, what mischief hath been done by Karna<br>uttering those cruel words, to the sons of Pandu! Was not the enmity<br>sufficient that was provoked by bringing Krishna into the assembly? How<br>can my wicked sons live, whose eldest brother and preceptor walketh not<br>in the path of righteousness? Seeing me void of eye-sight, and incapable<br>of exerting myself actively, my wretched son, O charioteer, believeth me<br>to be a fool, and listeneth not to my words. Those wretches also that are<br>his counsellors, viz., Karna and Suvala, and others, always pander to his<br>vices, as he is incapable of understanding things rightly. The shafts<br>that Arjuna of immeasurable prowess may lightly shoot, are capable of<br>consuming all my sons, leave alone those shafts that he will shoot,<br>impelled by anger. The arrows urged by the might of Arjuna's arms and<br>shot from his large bow, and inspired with mantras capable of converting<br>them into celestial weapons can chastise the celestials themselves. He<br>who hath for his counsellor and protector and friend that smiter of<br>sinful men&#8212;the lord of the three worlds&#8212;Hari himself&#8212;encountereth<br>nothing that he cannot conquer. This, O Sanjaya, is most marvellous in<br>Arjuna that, as we have heard, he hath been clasped by Mahadeva in his<br>arms. That also which Phalguna, assisted by Damodara did of old towards<br>helping Agni in the conflagration of Khandava, hath been witnessed by all<br>the world. When, therefore, Bhima and Partha and Vasudeva of the Satwata<br>race become enraged, surely my sons along with their friends and the<br>Suvalas are all unequal to fight with them.'"
