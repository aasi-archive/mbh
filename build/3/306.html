                            Vaisampayana said, "It was, O lord of earth, on the first day of the<br>lighted fortnight during the tenth month of the year that Pritha<br>conceived a son like the lord himself of the stars in the firmament. And<br>that damsel of excellent hips from fear of her friends, concealed her<br>conception, so that no one knew her condition. And as the damsel lived<br>entirely in the apartments assigned to the maidens and carefully<br>concealed her condition, no one except her nurse knew the truth. And in<br>due time that beauteous maiden, by the grace of deity, brought forth a<br>son resembling a very god. And even like his father, the child was<br>equipped in a coat of mail, and decked with brilliant ear-rings. And he<br>was possessed of leonine eyes and shoulders like those of a bull. And no<br>sooner was the beauteous girl delivered of a child, then she consulted<br>with her nurse and placed the infant in a commodious and smooth box made<br>of wicker work and spread over with soft sheets and furnished with a<br>costly pillow. And its surface was laid over with wax, and it was encased<br>in a rich cover. And with tears in her eyes, she carried the infant to<br>the river Aswa, and consigned the basket to its waters. And although she<br>knew it to be improper for an unmarried girl to bear offspring, yet from<br>parental affection, O foremost of kings, she wept piteously. Do thou<br>listen to the words Kunti weepingly uttered, while consigning the box to<br>the waters of the river Aswa, 'O child, may good betide thee at the hands<br>of all that inhabit the land, the water, the sky, and the celestial<br>regions. May all thy paths be auspicious! May no one obstruct thy way!<br>And, O son, may all that come across thee have their hearts divested of<br>hostility towards thee: And may that lord of waters, Varuna. protect thee<br>in water! And may the deity that rangeth the skies completely protect<br>thee in the sky. And may, O son, that best of those that impart heat,<br>viz., Surya, thy father, and from whom I have obtained thee as ordained<br>by Destiny, protect thee everywhere! And may the Adityas and the Vasus,<br>the Rudras and the Sadhyas, the Viswadevas and the Maruts, and the<br>cardinal points with the great Indra and the regents presiding over them,<br>and, indeed, all the celestials, protect thee in every place! Even in<br>foreign lands I shall be able to recognise thee by this mail of thine!<br>Surely, thy sire, O son, the divine Surya possessed of the wealth of<br>splendour, is blessed, for he will with his celestial sight behold thee<br>going down the current! Blessed also is that lady who will, O thou that<br>are begotten by a god, take thee for her son, and who will give thee suck<br>when thou art thirsty! And what a lucky dream hath been dreamt by her<br>that will adopt thee for her son, thee that is endued with solar<br>splendour, and furnished with celestial mail, and adorned with celestial<br>ear-rings, thee that hast expansive eyes resembling lotuses, a complexion<br>bright as burnished copper or lotus leaves, a fair forehead, and hair<br>ending in beautiful curls! O son, she that will behold thee crawl on the<br>ground, begrimed with dust, and sweetly uttering inarticulate words, is<br>surely blessed! And she also, O son, that will behold thee arrive at thy<br>youthful prime like maned lion born in Himalayan forests, is surely<br>blessed!'"<br><br>"O king, having thus bewailed long and piteously, Pritha laid the basket<br>on the waters of the river Aswa. And the lotus-eyed damsel, afflicted<br>with grief on account of her son and weeping bitterly, with her nurse<br>cast the basket at dead of night, and though desirous of beholding her<br>son often and again, returned, O monarch, to the palate, fearing lest her<br>father should come to know of what had happened. Meanwhile, the basket<br>floated from the river Aswa to the river Charmanwati, and from the<br>Charmanwati it passed to the Yamuna, and so on to the Ganga. And carried<br>by the waves of the Ganga, the child contained in the basket came to the<br>city of Champa ruled by a person of the Suta tribe. Indeed, the excellent<br>coat of mail and those ear-rings made of Amrita that were born with his<br>body, as also the ordinance of Destiny, kept the child alive."
