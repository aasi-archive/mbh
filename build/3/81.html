                            Vaisampayana said, "Hearing these words of his brothers as also of<br>Krishna, all of whom were anxious on account of Dhananjaya, king<br>Yudhishthira, the just, became melancholy. And at that time he saw<br>(before him) the celestial Rishi Narada blazing with Brahmi beauty and<br>like unto a fire flaming up in consequence of sacrificial libation. And<br>beholding him come, king Yudhishthira with his brothers stood up and duly<br>worshipped the illustrious one. And endued with blazing energy, the<br>handsome chief of the Kuru race, surrounded by his brothers, shone like<br>the god of a hundred sacrifices encircled by the celestials. And<br>Yajnaseni in obedience to the dictates of morality adhered to her lords,<br>the sons of Pritha, like Savitri to the Vedas or the rays of the Sun to<br>the peak of Meru. And the illustrious Rishi Narada, accepting that<br>worship, comforted the son of Dharma in proper terms. And, O sinless one,<br>addressing the high-souled king Yudhishthira, the just, the Rishi said,<br>'Tell me, O foremost of virtuous men, what it is that thou seekest and<br>what I can do for thee. At this, the royal son of Dharma bowing with his<br>brothers unto Narada, who was the revered of the celestials, told him<br>with joined hands, 'O thou that art highly blessed and worshipped by all<br>the worlds when thou art gratified with me, I regard all my wishes in<br>consequence of thy grace, as already fulfilled, O thou of excellent vows!<br>If, O sinless one, I with my brothers deserve thy favour, it behoveth<br>thee, O best of Munis, to dispel the doubt that is in my mind. It<br>behoveth thee to tell me in detail what merit is his that goeth round the<br>worlds, desirous of beholding the sacred waters and shrines that are on<br>it.'"<br><br>"Narada said, 'Listen, O king, with attention, to what the intelligent<br>Bhishma had heard before from Pulastya! Once, O blessed one, that<br>foremost of virtuous men, Bhishma, while in the observance of the Pitrya<br>vow, lived, O king, in the company of Munis in a delightful and sacred<br>region, near the source of the Ganga, that is resorted to by the<br>celestial Rishis and Gandharvas and the celestials themselves. And while<br>living there, the resplendent one gratified with his oblations the<br>Pitris, the gods and the Rishis, according to the rites inculcated in the<br>scriptures. And once on a time while the illustrious one was engaged in<br>his silent recitations, he beheld Pulastya&#8212;that best of Rishis, of<br>wonderful appearance. And beholding that austere ascetic blazing with<br>beauty, he was filled with great delight and exceeding wonder. And, O<br>Bharata, that foremost of virtuous men, Bhishma, then worshipped that<br>blessed Rishi according to the rites of the ordinance. And purifying<br>himself and with rapt attention, he approached that best of Brahmarshis,<br>with the Arghya on his head. And uttering aloud his name, he said, 'O<br>thou of excellent vow, blessed be thou, I am Bhishma, thy slave. At sight<br>of thee, I am freed from all my sins.' And saying this, that foremost of<br>virtuous men, Bhishma, restraining speeches stood, O Yudhishthira, in<br>silence and with joined hands. And beholding Bhishma that foremost of the<br>Kurus, reduced and emaciated by the observance of vows and the study of<br>the Vedas, the Muni became filled with joy."
