                            Vaisampayana said, "And the city of Indra which Arjuna saw was delightful<br>and was the resort of Siddhas and Charanas. And it was adorned with the<br>flowers of every season, and with sacred trees of all kinds. And he<br>beheld also celestial gardens called Nandana&#8212;the favourite resort of<br>Apsaras. And fanned by the fragrant breezes charged with the farina of<br>sweet-scented flowers, the trees with their lord of celestial blossoms<br>seemed to welcome him amongst them. And the region was such that none<br>could behold it who had not gone through ascetic austerities, or who had<br>not poured libations on fire. It was a region for the virtuous alone, and<br>not for those who had turned their back on the field of battle. And none<br>were competent to see it who had not performed sacrifices or observed<br>rigid vows, or who were without a knowledge of the Vedas, or who had not<br>bathed in sacred waters, or who were not distinguished for sacrifices and<br>gifts. And none were competent to see it who were disturbers of<br>sacrifices, or who were low, or who drank intoxicating liquors, or who<br>were violators of their preceptors' bed, or who were eaters of<br>(unsanctified) meat, or who were wicked. And having beheld those<br>celestial gardens resounding with celestial music, the strong-armed son<br>of Pandu entered the favourite city of Indra. And he beheld there<br>celestial cars by thousands, capable of going everywhere at will,<br>stationed in proper places. And he saw tens of thousands of such cars<br>moving in every direction. And fanned by pleasant breezes charged with<br>the perfumes of flowers, the son of Pandu was praised by Apsaras and<br>Gandharvas. And the celestials then, accompanied by the Gandharvas and<br>Siddhas and great Rishis, cheerfully reverenced Pritha's son of white<br>deeds. Benedictions were poured upon him, accompanied by the sounds of<br>celestial music. The strong-armed son of Pritha then heard around him the<br>music of conchs and drums. And praised all around, the son of Pritha then<br>went, at the command of Indra, to that large and extensive starry way<br>called by the name of Suravithi. There he met with the Sadhyas, the<br>Viswas, the Marutas, the twin Aswins, the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras,<br>the Brahmarshis of the great splendour, and numerous royal sages with<br>Dilipa at their head, and Tumvura and Narada, and that couple of<br>Gandharvas known by the names of Haha and Huhu. And the Kuru prince&#8212;that<br>chastiser of foes&#8212;having met and duly saluted them, last of all beheld<br>the chief of the celestials&#8212;the god of a hundred sacrifices. Then the<br>strong-armed son of Pritha, alighting from the car approached the lord<br>himself of the gods&#8212;his father&#8212;that chastiser of Paka. And a beautiful<br>white umbrella furnished with a golden staff was held over the chief of<br>the celestials. And he was fanned with a Chamara perfumed with celestial<br>scents. And he was eulogised by many Gandharvas headed by Viswavasu and<br>others, by bards and singers, and by foremost Brahmanas chanting Rik and<br>Yajus hymns. And the mighty son of Kunti, approaching Indra, saluted him<br>by bending his head to the ground. And Indra thereupon embraced him with<br>his round and plump arms. And taking his hand, Sakra made him sit by him<br>on a portion of his own seat, that sacred seat which was worshipped by<br>gods and Rishis. And the lord of the celestials-that slayer of hostile<br>heroes&#8212;smelt the head of Arjuna bending in humility, and even took him<br>upon his lap. Seated on Sakra's seat at the command of that god of a<br>thousand eyes, Pritha's son of immeasurable energy began to blaze in<br>splendour like a second Indra. And moved by affection, the slayer of<br>Vritra, consoling Arjuna, touched his beautiful face with his own<br>perfumed hands. And the wielder of the thunderbolt, patting and rubbing<br>gently again and again with his own hands which bore the marks of the<br>thunderbolt the handsome and huge arms of Arjuna which resembled a couple<br>of golden columns and which were hard in consequence of drawing the<br>bowstring and son enhanced the beauty of the assembly, like the sun and<br>moon god of a thousand eyes&#8212;eyeing his son of curly locks smilingly and<br>with eyes expanded with delight, seemed scarcely to be gratified. The<br>more he gazed, the more he liked to gaze on. And seated on one seat, the<br>father and son enhanced the beauty of the assembly, like the sun and moon<br>beautifying the firmament together on the fourteenth day of the dark<br>fortnight. And a band of Gandharvas headed by Tumvuru skilled in music<br>sacred and profane, sang many verses in melodious notes. And Ghritachi<br>and Menaka and Rambha and Purvachitti and Swayamprabha and Urvasi and<br>Misrakesi and Dandagauri and Varuthini and Gopali and Sahajanya and<br>Kumbhayoni and Prajagara and Chitrasena and Chitralekha and Saha and<br>Madhuraswana, these and others by thousands, possessed of eyes like lotus<br>leaves, who were employed in enticing the hearts of persons practising<br>rigid austerities, danced there. And possessing slim waists and fair<br>large hips, they began to perform various evolutions, shaking their deep<br>bosoms, and casting their glances around, and exhibiting other attractive<br>attitude capable of stealing the hearts and resolutions and minds of the<br>spectators."
