                            "The Brahmana enquired, 'How is it that fire (vital force) in combination<br>with the earthly element (matter), becomes the corporeal tenement (of<br>living creatures), and how doth the vital air (the breath of life)<br>according to the nature of its seat (the muscles and nerves) excite to<br>action (the corporeal frame)?' Markandeya said, 'This question, O<br>Yudhishthira, having been put to the Brahmana by the fowler, the latter,<br>in reply, said to that high-minded Brahmana. (The fowler said):&#8212;The<br>vital spirit manifesting itself in the seat of consciousness, causes the<br>action of the corporeal frame. And the soul being present in both of them<br>acts (through them). The past, the present and the future are inseparably<br>associated with the soul. And it is the highest of a creature's<br>possessions; it is of the essence of the Supreme Spirit and we adore it.<br>It is the animating principle of all creatures, and it is the eternal<br>purusha (spirit). It is great and it is the intelligence and the ego, and<br>it is the subjective seat of the various properties of elements. Thus<br>while seated here (in a corporeal frame) it is sustained in all its<br>relations external or internal (to matter or mind) by the subtle ethereal<br>air called prana, and thereafter, each creature goes its own way by the<br>action of another subtle air called Samana. And this latter transforming<br>itself into Apana air, and supported by the head of the stomach carries<br>the refuse matter of the body, urine &c, to the kidneys and intestines.<br>That same air is present in the three elements of effort, exertion and<br>power, and in that condition it is called Udana air by persons learned in<br>physical science, and when manifesting itself by its presence at all the<br>junctional points of the human system, it is known by the name Vyana. And<br>the internal heat is diffused over all the tissues of our system, and<br>supported by these kinds of air, it transforms our food and the tissues<br>and the humours of our system. And by the coalition of Prana and other<br>airs, a reaction (combination) ensues, and the heat generated thereby is<br>known as the internal heat of the human system which causes the digestion<br>of our food. The Prana and the Apana air are interposed within the Samana<br>and the Udana air. And the heat generated by their coalition causes the<br>growth of the body (consisting of the seven substances, bones, muscles,<br>&c). And that portion of its seat extending to as far as the rectum is<br>called Apana; and from that arteries arise in the five airs Prana, &c.<br>The Prana air, acted on by the heat strikes against the extremity of the<br>Apana region and then recoiling, it reacts on the heat. Above the navel<br>is the region of undigested food and below it the region of digestion.<br>And the Prana and all other airs of the system are seated in the navel.<br>The arteries issuing from the heart run upwards and downwards, as also in<br>oblique directions; they carry the best essence of our food, and are<br>acted upon by the ten Prana airs. This is the way by which patient Yogins<br>who have overcome all difficulties, and who view things with an impartial<br>and equal eye, with their souls seated in the brain, find the Supreme<br>Spirit, the Prana and the Apana airs are thus present in the body of all<br>creatures. Know that the spirit is embodied in corporeal disguise, in the<br>eleven allotropous conditions (of the animal system), and that though<br>eternal, its normal state is apparently modified by its<br>accompaniments,&#8212;even like the fire purified in its pan,&#8212;eternal, yet<br>with its course altered by its surroundings; and that the divine thing<br>which is kindred with the body is related to the latter in the same way<br>as a drop of water to the sleek surface of a lotus-leaf on which it<br>rolls. Know that sattwa, rajas and tamas, are the attributes of all life<br>and that life is the attribute of spirit, and that the latter again is an<br>attribute of the Supreme Spirit. Inert, insensible matter is the seat of<br>the living principle, which is active in itself and induces activity in<br>others. That thing by which the seven worlds are incited to action is<br>called the most high by men of high spiritual insight. Thus in all these<br>elements, the eternal spirit does not show itself, but is perceived by<br>the learned in spiritual science by reason of their high and keen<br>perception. A pure-minded person, by purification of his heart, is able<br>to destroy the good and evil effect of his actions and attains eternal<br>beatitude by the enlightenment of his inward spirit. That state of peace<br>and purification of heart is likened to the state of a person who in a<br>cheerful state of mind sleeps soundly, or the brilliance of a lamp<br>trimmed by a skillful hand. Such a pure-minded person living on spare<br>diet perceives the Supreme Spirit reflected in his own, and by practising<br>concentration of mind in the evening and small hours of the night, he<br>beholds the Supreme Spirit which has no attributes, in the light of his<br>heart, shining like a dazzling lamp, and thus he attains salvation.<br>Avarice and anger must be subdued by all means, for this act constitutes<br>the most sacred virtue that people can practise and is considered to be<br>the means by which men can cross over to the other side of this sea of<br>affliction and trouble. A man must preserve his righteousness from being<br>overcome by the evil consequences of anger, his virtues from the effects<br>of pride, his learning from the effects of vanity, and his own spirit<br>from illusion. Leniency is the best of virtues, and forbearance is the<br>best of powers, the knowledge of our spiritual nature is the best of all<br>knowledge, and truthfulness is the best of all religious obligations. The<br>telling of truth is good, and the knowledge of truth may also be good,<br>but what conduces to the greatest good of all creatures, is known as the<br>highest truth. He whose actions are performed not with the object of<br>securing any reward or blessing, who has sacrificed all to the<br>requirements of his renunciation, is a real Sannyasin and is really wise.<br>And as communion with Brahma cannot be taught to us, even by our<br>spiritual preceptor,&#8212;he only giving us a clue to the<br>mystery&#8212;renunciation of the material world is called Yoga. We must not<br>do harm to any creature and must live in terms of amity with all, and in<br>this our present existence, we must not avenge ourselves on any creature.<br>Self-abnegation, peace of mind, renunciation of hope, and<br>equanimity,&#8212;these are the ways by which spiritual enlightenment can<br>always be secured; and the knowledge of self (one's own spiritual nature)<br>is the best of all knowledge. In this world as well as hereafter,<br>renouncing all worldly desires and assuming a stoic indifference, wherein<br>all suffering is at rest, people should fulfil their religious duties<br>with the aid of their intelligence. The muni who desires to obtain moksha<br>(salvation), which is very difficult to attain, must be constant in<br>austerities, forbearing, self-restrained, and must give up that longing<br>fondness which binds him to the things of this earth. They call these the<br>attributes of the Supreme Spirit. The gunas (qualities or attributes)<br>that we are conscious of, reduce themselves to agunas (non-gunas) in Him;<br>He is not bound by anything, and is perceptible only by the expansion and<br>development of our spiritual vision; as soon as the illusion of ignorance<br>is dispelled, this supreme unalloyed beatitude is attained. By foregoing<br>the objects of both pleasure and pain and by renouncing the feelings<br>which bind him to the things of this earth, a man may attain Brahma<br>(Supreme Spirit or salvation). O good Brahmana, I have now briefly<br>explained to thee all this, as I have heard. What else dost thou wish to<br>know?"
