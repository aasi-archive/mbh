                            Vaisampayana continued, "Having approached that one, whose sins had been<br>consumed by asceticism, Yudhishthira announced his name, and gladly<br>greeted him, bending his head. And then Krishna, and Bhima, and the<br>devout twins, having bowed down their heads unto the royal sage, stood<br>(there) surrounding him. And that priest of the Pandavas, the virtuous<br>Dhaumya, also duly approached that vow-observing sage. And by his<br>prophetic eye that virtuous Muni had already known (the identity of)<br>those foremost of the Kurus, the sons of Pandu. And he said unto them.<br>'Be ye seated.' And that one of rigid austerities, after having duly<br>received that chief of the Kurus, when the latter with his brothers had<br>seated himself enquired after his welfare saying, 'Dost thou not turn thy<br>inclination upon untruth? And art thou intent upon virtue? And. O Partha,<br>hath not thy attention to thy father and thy mother diminished? Are all<br>thy superiors, and the aged, and those versed in the Vedas, honoured by<br>thee? And O Pritha's son, dost thou not turn thy inclination unto sinful<br>acts? And dost thou, O best of the Kurus, properly know how to perform<br>meritorious acts, and to eschew wicked deeds? Dost thou not exalt<br>thyself? And are pious men gratified, being honoured by thee? And even<br>dwelling in the woods, dost thou follow virtue alone? And, O Partha, doth<br>not Dhaumya grieve at thy conduct? Dost thou follow the customs of thy<br>ancestors, by charity, and religious observances, and asceticism, and<br>purity, and candour, and forgiveness? And dost thou go along the way<br>taken by the royal sages? On the birth of a son in their (respective)<br>lines, the Pitris in their regions, both laugh and grieve, thinking&#8212;Will<br>the sinful acts of this son of ours harm us, or will meritorious deeds<br>conduce to our welfare? He conquereth both the worlds that payeth homage<br>unto his father, and mother, and preceptor, and Agni, and fifthly, the<br>soul.' Yudhishthira said, 'O worshipful one, those duties have been<br>mentioned by thee as excellent. To the best of my power I duly and<br>properly discharge them.'<br><br>Arshtishena said, 'During the Parvas sages subsisting on air and water<br>come unto this best of the mountains ranging through the air. And on the<br>summits of the mountain are seen amorous Kimpurushas with their<br>paramours, mutually attached unto each other; as also, O Partha, many<br>Gandharvas and Apsaras clad in white silk vestments; and lovely-looking<br>Vidyadharas, wearing garlands; and mighty Nagas, and Suparnas, and<br>Uragas, and others. And on the summits of the mountain are heard, during<br>the Parvas, sounds of kettle-drums, and tabors, shells and mridangas. O<br>foremost of the Bharatas, even by staying here, ye shall hear those<br>sounds; do ye by no means feel inclined to repair thither. Further, O<br>best of the Bharata race, it is impossible, to proceed beyond this. That<br>place is the sporting-region of the celestials. There is no access<br>thither for mortals. O Bharata, at this place all creatures bear ill-will<br>to, and the Rakshasas chastise, that man who committeth aggression, be it<br>ever so little. Beyond the summit of this Kailasa cliff, is seen the path<br>of the celestial sages. If any one through impudence goeth beyond this,<br>the Rakshasas slay him with iron darts and other weapons. There, O child,<br>during the Parvas, he that goeth about on the shoulders of men, even<br>Vaisravana is seen in pomp and grandeur surrounded by the Apsaras. And<br>when that lord of all the Rakshasas is seated on the summit, all<br>creatures behold him like unto the sun arisen, O best of Bharatas, that<br>summit is the sporting-garden of the celestials, and the Danavas, and the<br>Siddhas, and Vaisravana. And during the Parvas, as Tumburu entertaineth<br>the Lord of treasures, the sweet notes of his song are heard all over the<br>Gandhamadana. O child, O Yudhishthira, here during the Parvas, all<br>creatures see and hear marvels like this. O Pandavas, till ye meet with<br>Arjuna, do ye stay here, partaking of luscious fruits, and the food of<br>the Munis. O child as thou hast come hither, do thou not betray any<br>impertinence. And, O child, after living here at thy will and diverting<br>thyself as thou listest, thou wilt at length rule the earth, having<br>conquered it by the force of thy arms.'"
