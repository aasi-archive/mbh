                            Vaisampayana said, "The wielder of the Pinaka, having the bull for his<br>sign, thus disappeared in the very sight of the gazing son of Pandu, like<br>the sun setting in the sight of the world. Arjuna, that slayer of hostile<br>heroes, wondered much at this, saying, 'O, I have seen the great god of<br>gods. 'Fortunate, indeed I am, and much favoured, for I have both beheld<br>and touched with my hand the three-eyed Hara the wielder of the Pinaka,<br>in his boon-giving form. I shall win success. I am already great. My<br>enemies have already been vanquished by me. My purposes have been already<br>achieved.' And while the son of Pritha, endued with immeasurable energy,<br>was thinking thus, there came to that place Varuna the god of waters,<br>handsome and of the splendour of the lapis lazuli accompanied by all<br>kinds of aquatic creatures, and filling all the points of the horizon<br>with a blazing effulgence. And accompanied by Rivers both male and<br>female, and Nagas, and Daityas and Sadhyas and inferior deities, Varuna,<br>the controller and lord of all aquatic creatures, arrived at that spot.<br>There came also the lord Kuvera of body resembling pure gold, seated on<br>his car of great splendour, and accompanied by numerous Yakshas. And the<br>lord of treasures, possessed of great beauty, came there to see Arjuna,<br>illuminating the firmament with his effulgence. And there came also Yama<br>himself, of great beauty, the powerful destroyer of all the worlds,<br>accompanied by those lords of the creation&#8212;the Pitris&#8212;both embodied and<br>disembodied. And the god of justice, of inconceivable soul, the son of<br>Surya, the destroyer of all creatures, with the mace in hand, came there<br>on his car, illuminating the three worlds with regions of the Guhyakas,<br>the Gandharvas and the Nagas, like a second Surya as he riseth at the end<br>of the Yuga. Having arrived there, they beheld, from the effulgent and<br>variegated summits of the great mountain, Arjuna engaged in ascetic<br>austerities. And there came in a moment the illustrious Sakra also,<br>accompanied by his queen, seated on the back of (the celestial elephant)<br>Airavata, and surrounded also by all the deities. And in consequence of<br>the white umbrella being held over his head, he looked like the moon amid<br>fleecy clouds. And eulogised by Gandharvas, and Rishis endued with wealth<br>of asceticism, the chief of the celestials alighted on a particular<br>summit of the mountain, like a second sun. Then Yama possessed of great<br>intelligence, and fully conversant with virtue, who had occupied a summit<br>on the south, in a voice deep as that of the clouds, said these<br>auspicious words, 'Arjuna, behold us, the protectors of the worlds,<br>arrive here! We will grant thee (spiritual) vision, for thou deservest to<br>behold us. Thou wert in thy former life a Rishi of immeasurable soul,<br>known as Nara of great might At the command, O child, of Brahma, thou<br>hast been born among men! O sinless one, by thee shall be vanquished in<br>battle the highly virtuous grandsire of the Kurus&#8212;Bhishma of great<br>energy&#8212;who is born of the Vasus. Thou shalt also defeat all the<br>Kshatriyas of fiery energy commanded by the son of Bharadwaja in battle.<br>Thou shalt also defeat those Danavas of fierce prowess that have been<br>born amongst men, and those Danavas also that are called Nivatakavachas.<br>And, O son of the Kuru race, O Dhananjaya, thou shalt also slay Karna of<br>fierce prowess, who is even a portion of my father Surya, of energy<br>celebrated throughout the worlds. And, O son of Kunti, smiter of all<br>foes, thou shalt also slay all the portions of celestials and Danavas and<br>the Rakshasas that have been incarnate on earth. And slain by thee, these<br>shall attain to the regions earned by them according to their acts. And,<br>O Phalguna, the fame of thy achievements will last for ever in the world:<br>thou hast gratified Mahadeva himself in conflict. Thou shalt, with Vishnu<br>himself, lighten the burden of the earth. O accept this weapon of<br>mine&#8212;the mace I wield incapable of being baffled by any body. With this<br>weapon thou wilt achieve great deeds.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "O Janamejaya, the son of Pritha then received<br>from Yama that weapon duly, along with the Mantras and rite, and the<br>mysteries of hurling and withdrawing it. Then Varuna, the lord of all<br>aquatic creatures, blue as the clouds, from a summit he had occupied on<br>the west, uttered these words, 'O son of Pritha, thou art the foremost of<br>Kshatriyas, and engaged in Kshatriya practices. O thou of large coppery<br>eyes, behold me! I am Varuna, the lord of waters. Hurled by me, my nooses<br>are incapable of being resisted. O son of Kunti, accept of me these<br>Varuna weapons along with the mysteries of hurling and withdrawing them.<br>With these, O hero, in the battle that ensued of your on account of<br>Taraka (the wife of Vrihaspati), thousands of mighty Daityas were seized<br>and tied. Accept them of me. Even if Yama himself by thy foe, with these<br>in thy hands, he will not be able to escape from thee. When thou wilt<br>armed with these, range over the field of battle, the land, beyond doubt,<br>will be destitute of Kshatriyas.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "After both Varuna and Yama had given away their<br>celestial weapons, the lord of treasures having his home on the heights<br>of Kailasa, then spake, 'O son of Pandu, O thou of great might and<br>wisdom, I too have been pleased with thee. And this meeting with thee<br>giveth me as much pleasure as a meeting with Krishna. O wielder of the<br>bow with the left hand, O thou of mighty arms, thou wert a god before,<br>eternal (as other gods). In ancient Kalpas, thou hadst every day gone<br>through ascetic austerities along with us. O best of men, I grant thee<br>celestial vision. O thou of mighty arms, thou wilt defeat even invincible<br>Daityas and Danavas. Accept of me also without loss of time, an excellent<br>weapon. With this thou wilt be able to consume the ranks of<br>Dhritarashtra. Take then this favourite weapon of mine called<br>Antarddhana. Endued with energy and prowess and splendour, it is capable<br>of sending the foe to sleep. When the illustrious Sankara slew Tripura,<br>even this was the weapon which he shot and by which many mighty Asuras<br>were consumed. O thou of invincible prowess I take it up for giving it to<br>thee. Endued with the dignity of the Meru, thou art competent to hold<br>this weapon.'"<br><br>"After these words had been spoken, the Kuru prince Arjuna endued with<br>great strength, duly received from Kuvera that celestial weapon. Then the<br>chief of the celestials addressing Pritha's son of ceaseless deeds in<br>sweet words, said, in a voice deep as that the clouds or the kettle-drum,<br>'O thou mighty-armed son of Kunti, thou art an ancient god. Thou hast<br>already achieved the highest success, and acquired the statue of a god.<br>But, O represser of foes, thou hast yet to accomplish the purposes of the<br>gods. Thou must ascend to heaven. Therefore prepare thou O hero of great<br>splendour! My own car with Matali as charioteer, will soon descend on the<br>earth. Taking thee, O Kaurava, to heaven, I will grant thee there all my<br>celestial weapons.'"<br><br>"Beholding those protectors of the worlds assembled together on the<br>heights of Himavat, Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, wondered much, Endued<br>with great energy, he then duly worshipped the assembled Lokapalas, with<br>words, water, and fruits. The celestials then returning that worship,<br>went away. And the gods capable of going everywhere at will, and endued<br>with the speed of the mind, returned to the places whence they had come."<br><br>"That bull among men&#8212;Arjuna&#8212;having obtained weapons thus, was filled<br>with pleasure. And he regarded himself as one whose desires had been<br>fulfilled and who was crowned with success."
