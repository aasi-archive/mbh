                            "Vaisampayana said Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, once more asked the<br>great Muni Markandeya about the future course of the government of the<br>Earth.<br><br>"And Yudhishthira said, 'O thou foremost of all speakers, O Muni of<br>Bhrigu's race, that which we have heard from thee about the destruction<br>and re-birth of all things at the end of the Yuga, is, indeed, full of<br>wonder! I am filled with curiosity, however, in respect of what may<br>happen in the Kali age. When morality and virtue will be at an end, what<br>will remain there! What will be the prowess of men in that age, what<br>their food, and what their amusements? What will be the period of life at<br>the end of the Yuga? What also is the limit, having attained which the<br>Krita age will begin anew? Tell me all in detail, O Muni, for all that<br>thou narratest is varied and delightful.'<br><br>"Thus addressed, that foremost of Munis began his discourse again,<br>delighting that tiger of the Vrishni race and the sons of Pandu as well.<br>And Markandeya said, 'Listen, O monarch, to all that hath been seen and<br>heard by me, and to all, O king of kings, that hath been known to me by<br>intuition from the grace of the God of gods! O bull of the Bharata race,<br>listen to me as I narrate the future history of the world during the<br>sinful age. O bull of the Bharata race, in the Krita age, everything was<br>free from deceit and guile and avarice and covetousness; and morality<br>like a bull was among men, with all the four legs complete. In the Treta<br>age sin took away one of these legs and morality had three legs. In the<br>Dwapara, sin and morality are mixed half and half; and accordingly<br>morality is said to have two legs only. In the dark age (of Kali), O thou<br>best of the Bharata race, morality mixed with three parts of sin liveth<br>by the side of men. Accordingly morality then is said to wait on men,<br>with only a fourth part of itself remaining. Know, O Yudhishthira, that<br>the period of life, the energy, intellect and the physical strength of<br>men decrease in every Yuga! O Pandava, the Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and<br>Vaisyas and Sudras, (in the Kali age) will practise morality and virtue<br>deceitfully and men in general will deceive their fellows by spreading<br>the net of virtue. And men with false reputation of learning will, by<br>their acts, cause Truth to be contracted and concealed. And in<br>consequence of the shortness of their lives they will not be able to<br>acquire much knowledge. And in consequence of the littleness of their<br>knowledge, they will have no wisdom. And for this, covetousness and<br>avarice will overwhelm them all. And wedded to avarice and wrath and<br>ignorance and lust men will entertain animosities towards one another,<br>desiring to take one another's lives. And Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and<br>Vaisyas with their virtue contracted and divested of asceticism and truth<br>will all be reduced to an equality with the Sudras. And the lowest orders<br>of men will rise to the position of the intermediate ones, and those in<br>intermediate stations will, without doubt, descend to the level of the<br>lowest ones. Even such, O Yudhishthira, will become the state of the<br>world at the end of the Yuga. Of robes those will be regarded the best<br>that are made of flax and of grain the Paspalum frumentacea[45] will be<br>regarded the best. Towards this period men will regard their wives as<br>their (only) friends. And men will live on fish and milk, goats and<br>sheep, for cows will be extinct. And towards that period, even they that<br>are always observant of vows, will become covetous. And opposed to one<br>another, men will, at such a time, seek one another's lives; and divested<br>of Yuga, people will become atheists and thieves. And they will even dig<br>the banks of streams with their spades and sow grains thereon. And even<br>those places will prove barren for them at such a time. And those men who<br>are devoted to ceremonial rites in honour of the deceased and of the<br>gods, will be avaricious and will also appropriate and enjoy what belongs<br>to others. The father will enjoy what belongs to the son; and the son,<br>what belongs to the father. And those things will also be enjoyed by men<br>in such times, the enjoyment of which hath been forbidden in the<br>scriptures. And the Brahmanas, speaking disrespectfully of the Vedas,<br>will not practise vows, and their understanding clouded by the science of<br>disputation, they will no longer perform sacrifices and the Homa. And<br>deceived by the false science of reasons, they will direct their hearts<br>towards everything mean and low. And men will till low lands for<br>cultivation and employ cows and calves that are one year old, in drawing<br>the plough and carrying burthens. And sons having slain their sires, and<br>sires having slain their sons will incur no opprobrium. And they will<br>frequently save themselves from anxiety by such deeds, and even glory in<br>them. And the whole world will be filled with mleccha behaviour and<br>notions and ceremonies, and sacrifices will cease and joy will be nowhere<br>and general rejoicing will disappear. And men will rob the possession of<br>helpless persons of those that are friendless and of wisdoms also. And,<br>possessed of small energy and strength, without knowledge and given to<br>avarice and folly and sinful practices men will accept with joy the gifts<br>made by wicked people with words of contempt. And, O son of Kunti, the<br>kings of the earth, with hearts wedded to sin without knowledge and<br>always boastful of their wisdom, will challenge one another from desire<br>of taking one another's life. And the Kshatriyas also towards the end of<br>such a period will become the thorns of the earth. And filled with<br>avarice and swelling with pride and vanity and, unable and unwilling to<br>protect (their subjects), they will take pleasure in inflicting<br>punishments only. And attacking and repeating their attacks upon the good<br>and the honest, and feeling no pity for the latter, even when they will<br>cry in grief, the Kshatriyas will, O Bharata, rob these of their wives<br>and wealth. And no one will ask for a girl (for purposes of marriage) and<br>no one will give away a girl (for such purposes), but the girls will<br>themselves choose their lords, when the end of the Yuga comes. And the<br>kings of the earth with souls steeped in ignorance, and discontented with<br>what they have, will at such a time, rob their subjects by every means in<br>their power. And without doubt the whole world will be mlecchified.[46]<br>And when the end of the Yuga comes, the right hand will deceive the left;<br>and the left, the right. And men with false reputation of learning will<br>contract Truth and the old will betray the senselessness of the young,<br>and the young will betray the dotage of the old. And cowards will have<br>the reputation of bravery and the brave will be cheerless like cowards.<br>And towards the end of the Yuga men will cease to trust one another. And<br>full of avarice and folly the whole world will have but one kind of food.<br>And sin will increase and prosper, while virtue will fade and cease to<br>flourish. And Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas will disappear,<br>leaving, O king, no remnants of their orders. And all men towards the end<br>of the Yuga will become members of one common order, without distinction<br>of any kind. And sires will not forgive sons, and sons will not forgive<br>sires. And when the end approaches, wives will not wait upon and serve<br>their husbands. And at such a time men will seek those countries where<br>wheat and barley form the staple food. And, O monarch, both men and women<br>will become perfectly free in their behaviour and will not tolerate one<br>another's acts. And, O Yudhishthira, the whole world will be mlecchified.<br>And men will cease to gratify the gods by offerings of Sraddhas. And no<br>one will listen to the words of others and no one will be regarded as a<br>preceptor by another. And, O ruler of men, intellectual darkness will<br>envelop the whole earth, and the life of man will then be measured by<br>sixteen years, on attaining to which age death will ensue. And girls of<br>five or six years of age will bring forth children and boys of seven or<br>eight years of age will become fathers. And, O tiger among kings, when<br>the end of the Yuga will come, the wife will never be content with her<br>husband, nor the husband with his wife. And the possessions of men will<br>never be much, and people will falsely bear the marks of religion, and<br>jealousy and malice will fill the world. And no one will, at that time,<br>be a giver (of wealth or anything else) in respect to any one else. And<br>the inhabited regions of the earth will be afflicted with dearth and<br>famine, and the highways will be filled with lustful men and women of<br>evil repute. And, at such a time, the women will also entertain an<br>aversion towards their husbands. And without doubt all men will adopt the<br>behaviour of the mlecchas, become omnivorous without distinction, and<br>cruel in all their acts, when the end of the Yuga will come. And, O thou<br>foremost of the Bharatas, urged by avarice, men will, at that time,<br>deceive one another when they sell and purchase. And without a knowledge<br>of the ordinance, men will perform ceremonies and rites, and, indeed,<br>behave as listeth them, when the end of the Yuga comes. And when the end<br>of the Yuga comes, urged by their very dispositions, men will act<br>cruelly, and speak ill of one another. And people will, without<br>compunction, destroy trees and gardens. And men will be filled with<br>anxiety as regards the means of living. And, O king, overwhelmed with<br>covetousness, men will kill Brahmanas and appropriate and enjoy the<br>possessions of their victims. And the regenerate ones, oppressed by<br>Sudras, and afflicted with fear, and crying Oh and Alas, will wander over<br>the earth without anybody to protect them. And when men will begin to<br>slay one another, and become wicked and fierce and without any respect<br>for animal life, then will the Yuga come to an end. And, O king, even the<br>foremost of the regenerate ones, afflicted by robbers, will, like crows,<br>fly in terror and with speed, and seek refuge, O perpetuator of the Kuru<br>race, in rivers and mountains and inaccessible regions. And always<br>oppressed by bad rulers with burthens of taxes, the foremost of the<br>regenerate classes, O lord of the earth, will, in those terrible times,<br>take leave of all patience and do improper acts by becoming even the<br>servants of the Sudras. And Sudras will expound the scriptures, and<br>Brahmanas will wait upon and listen to them, and settle their course of<br>duty accepting such interpretations as their guides. And the low will<br>become the high, and the course of things will look contrary. And<br>renouncing the gods, men will worship bones and other relics deposited<br>within walls. And, at the end of the Yuga, the Sudras will cease to wait<br>upon and serve the Brahmanas. And in the asylums of great Rishis, and the<br>teaching institutions of Brahmanas, and in places sacred to the gods and<br>sacrificial compounds, and in sacred tanks, the earth will be disfigured<br>with tombs and pillars containing bony relics and not graced with temples<br>dedicated to the gods. All this will take place at the end of the Yuga,<br>and know that these are the signs of the end of the Yuga. And when men<br>become fierce and destitute of virtue and carnivorous and addicted to<br>intoxicating drinks, then doth the Yuga come to an end. And, O monarch,<br>when flowers will be begot within flowers, and fruits within fruits, then<br>will the Yuga come to an end. And the clouds will pour rain unseasonably<br>when the end of the Yuga approaches. And, at that time, ceremonial rites<br>of men will not follow one another in due order, and the Sudras will<br>quarrel with the Brahmanas. And the earth will soon be full of mlecchas,<br>and the Brahmanas will fly in all directions for fear of the burthen of<br>taxes. And all distinctions between men will cease as regards conduct and<br>behaviour, and afflicted with honorary tasks and offices, people will fly<br>to woody retreats, subsisting on fruits and roots. And the world will be<br>so afflicted, that rectitude of conduct will cease to be exhibited<br>anywhere. And disciples will set at naught the instructions of<br>preceptors, and seek even to injure them. And preceptors impoverished<br>will be disregarded by men. And friends and relatives and kinsmen will<br>perform friendly offices for the sake of the wealth only that is<br>possessed by a person. And when the end of the Yuga comes, everybody will<br>be in want. And all the points of the horizon will be ablaze, and the<br>stars and stellar groups will be destitute of brilliancy, and the planets<br>and planetary conjunctions will be inauspicious. And the course of the<br>winds will be confused and agitated, and innumerable meteors will flash<br>through the sky, foreboding evil. And the Sun will appear with six others<br>of the same kind. And all around there will be din and uproar, and<br>everywhere there will be conflagrations. And the Sun, from the hour of<br>his rising to that of setting, will be enveloped by Rahu. And the deity<br>of a thousand eyes will shower rain unseasonably. And when the end of the<br>Yuga comes, crops will not grow in abundance. And the women will always<br>be sharp in speech and pitiless and fond of weeping. And they will never<br>abide by the commands of their husbands. And when the end of the Yuga<br>comes, sons will slay fathers and mothers. And women, living<br>uncontrolled, will slay their husbands and sons. And, O king, when the<br>end of the Yuga comes, Rahu will swallow the Sun unseasonably. And fires<br>will blaze up on all sides. And travellers unable to obtain food and<br>drink and shelter even when they ask for these, will lie down on the<br>wayside refraining from urging their solicitations. And when the end of<br>the Yuga comes, crows and snakes and vultures and kites and other animals<br>and birds will utter frightful and dissonant cries. And when the end of<br>the Yuga comes, men will cast away and neglect their friends and<br>relatives and attendants. And, O monarch, when the end of the Yuga comes,<br>men abandoning the countries and directions and towns and cities of their<br>occupation, will seek for new ones, one after another. And people will<br>wander over the earth, uttering, 'O father, O son', and such other<br>frightful and rending cries.<br><br>"And when those terrible times will be over, the creation will begin<br>anew. And men will again be created and distributed into the four orders<br>beginning with Brahmanas. And about that time, in order that men may<br>increase, Providence, according to its pleasure, will once more become<br>propitious. And then when the Sun, the Moon, and Vrihaspati will, with<br>the constellation Pushya[47], enter the same sign, the Krita age will<br>begin again. And the clouds will commence to shower seasonably, and the<br>stars and stellar conjunctions will become auspicious. And the planets,<br>duly revolving in their orbits, will become exceedingly propitious. And<br>all around, there will be prosperity and abundance and health and peace.<br>And commissioned by Time, a Brahmana of the name of Kalki will take his<br>birth. And he will glorify Vishnu and possess great energy, great<br>intelligence, and great prowess. And he will take his birth in a town of<br>the name of Sambhala in an auspicious Brahmana family. And vehicles and<br>weapons, and warriors and arms, and coats of mail will be at his disposal<br>as soon as he will think of them. And he will be the king of kings, and<br>ever victorious with the strength of virtue. And he will restore order<br>and peace in this world crowded with creatures and contradictory in its<br>course. And that blazing Brahmana of mighty intellect, having appeared,<br>will destroy all things. And he will be the Destroyer of all, and will<br>inaugurate a new Yuga. And surrounded by the Brahmanas, that Brahmana<br>will exterminate all the mlecchas wherever those low and despicable<br>persons may take refuge."
