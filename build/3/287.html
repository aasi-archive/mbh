                            "Markandeya said, 'Beholding both the brothers Rama and Lakshmana<br>prostrate on the ground, the son of Ravana tied them in a net-work of<br>those arrows of his which he had obtained as boons. And tied by Indrajit<br>on the field of battle by means of that arrowy net, those heroic tigers<br>among men resembled a couple of hawks immured in a cage. And beholding<br>those heroes prostrate on the ground pierced with hundreds of arrows,<br>Sugriva with all the monkeys stood surrounding them on all sides. And the<br>king of the monkeys stood there, accompanied by Sushena and Mainda and<br>Dwivida, and Kumuda and Angada and Hanuman and Nila and Tara and Nala.<br>And Vibhishana, having achieved success in another part of the field,<br>soon arrived at that spot, and roused those heroes from insensibility,<br>awakening them by means of the weapon called, Prajna.[101] Then Sugriva<br>soon extracted the arrows from their bodies. And by means of that most<br>efficacious medicine called the Visalya[102], applied with celestial<br>mantras, those human heroes regained their consciousness. And the arrow<br>having been extracted from their bodies, those mighty warriors in a<br>moment rose from their recumbent posture, their pains and fatigue<br>thoroughly alleviated. And beholding Rama the descendant of Ikshwaku's<br>race, quite at his ease, Vibhishana, O son of Pritha, joining his hands;<br>told him these words, 'O chastiser of foes, at the command of the king of<br>the Guhyakas, a Guhyaka hath come from the White mountains, bringing with<br>him his water![103] O great king, this water is a present to thee from<br>Kuvera, so that all creatures that are invisible may, O chastiser of<br>foes, become visible to thee! This water laved over the eyes will make<br>every invisible creature visible to thee, as also to any other person to<br>whom thou mayst give it!'&#8212;Saying&#8212;So be it,&#8212;Rama took that sacred<br>water, and sanctified his own eyes therewith. And the high-minded<br>Lakshmana also did the same. And Sugriva and Jambuvan, and Hanuman and<br>Angada, and Mainda and Dwivida, and Nila and many other foremost of the<br>monkeys, laved their eyes with that water. And thereupon it exactly<br>happened as Vibhishana had said, for, O Yudhishthira, soon did the eyes<br>of all these became capable of beholding things that could not be seen by<br>the unassisted eye!<br><br>"Meanwhile, Indrajit, after the success he had won, went to his father.<br>And having informed him of the feats he had achieved, he speedily<br>returned to the field of battle and placed himself at the van of his<br>army. The son of Sumitra then, under Vibhishana's guidance, rushed<br>towards that wrathful son of Ravana coming back, from desire of battle,<br>to lead the attack. And Lakshmana, excited to fury and receiving a hint<br>from Vibhishana, and desiring to slay Indrajit who had not completed his<br>daily sacrifice, smote with his arrows that warrior burning to achieve<br>success. And desirous of vanquishing each other, the encounter that took<br>place between them was exceedingly wonderful like that (in days of yore)<br>between the Lord of celestials and Prahrada. And Indrajit pierced the son<br>of Sumitra with arrows penetrating into his very vitals. And the son of<br>Sumitra also pierced Ravana's son with arrows of fiery energy. And<br>pierced with Lakshmana's arrows, the son of Ravana became senseless with<br>wrath. And he shot at Lakshmana eight shafts fierce as venomous snakes.<br>Listen now, O Yudhishthira, as I tell thee how the heroic son of Sumitra<br>then took his adversary's life by means of three winged arrows possessed<br>of the energy and effulgence of fire! With one of these, he severed from<br>Indrajit's body that arm of his enemy which had grasped the bow. With the<br>second he caused that other arm which had held the arrows, to drop down<br>on the ground. With the third that was bright and possessed of the<br>keenest edge, he cut off his head decked with a beautiful nose and bright<br>with ear-rings. And shorn of arms and head, the trunk became fearful to<br>behold. And having slain the foe thus, that foremost of mighty men then<br>slew with his arrows the charioteer of his adversary. And the horses then<br>dragged away the empty chariot into the city. And Ravana then beheld that<br>car without his son on it. And hearing that his son had been slain,<br>Ravana suffered his heart to be overpowered with grief. And under the<br>influence of extreme grief and affliction, the king of the Rakshasas<br>suddenly cherished the desire of killing the princess of Mithila. And<br>seizing a sword, the wicked Rakshasa hastily ran towards that lady<br>staying within the Asoka wood longing to behold her lord. Then Avindhya<br>beholding that sinful purpose of the wicked wretch, appeased his fury.<br>Listen, O Yudhishthira, to the reasons urged by Avindhya! That wise<br>Rakshasa said, 'Placed as thou art on the blazing throne of an empire, it<br>behoveth thee not to slay a woman! Besides, this woman is already slain,<br>considering that she is a captive in thy power! I think, she would not be<br>slain if only her body were destroyed. Slay thou her husband! He being<br>slain, she will be slain too! Indeed, not even he of an hundred<br>sacrifices (Indra) is thy equal in prowess! The gods with Indra at their<br>head, had repeatedly been affrighted by thee in battle!' With these and<br>many other words of the same import, Avindhya succeeded in appeasing<br>Ravana. And the latter did, indeed, listen to his counsellor's speech.<br>And that wanderer of the night, then, resolved to give battle himself<br>sheathed his sword, and issued orders for preparing his chariot.'"
