                            "Lomasa said, 'One day in the month of Chaitra, while fearlessly<br>wandering at large, Yavakri approached the hermitage of Raivya. And O son<br>of Bharata, in that beautiful hermitage, adorned with trees bearing<br>blossoms, he happened to behold the daughter-in-law of Raivya, sauntering<br>about like a Kinnara woman. And having lost his senses through passion,<br>Yavakri shamelessly spake unto the bashful maiden, saying, 'Be thou<br>attached unto me.' Thereupon, knowing his nature, and afraid of a curse,<br>as well as thinking of Raivya's power, she went unto him saying, 'I<br>agree.' Then, O son of Bharata, taking him in private, she kept him<br>chained. O conqueror of foes, returning to his hermitage, Raivya found<br>his daughter-in-law, Paravasu's wife, in tears. O Yudhishthira, thereat<br>consoling her with soft words, he enquired of her as to the cause of her<br>grief. Thereupon, the beautiful damsel told him all that Yavakri had said<br>unto her, and what she also had cleverly said unto him. Hearing of this<br>gross misbehaviour of Yavakri, the mind of the sage flamed up, and he<br>waxed exceedingly wroth. And being thus seized with passion, the great<br>sage of a highly irascible temper, tore off a matted lock of his hair,<br>and with holy mantras, offered it as a sacrifice on the sacred fire. At<br>this, there sprang out of it a female exactly resembling his<br>daughter-in-law. And then he plucked another matted lock of his hair, and<br>again offered it as a sacrifice into the fire. Thereupon sprang out of it<br>a demon, terrible to behold, and having fierce eyes. Then those, two<br>spake unto Raivya, saying, 'What shall we do?' Thereat, the angry sage<br>said unto them, 'Go and kill Yavakri.' Then saying, 'We shall do (as thou<br>biddest)'&#8212;they two went away with the intention of slaying Yavakri. And<br>with her charms, the female whom the large-hearted sage had created,<br>robbed Yavakri of his sacred water-pot. Then with his uplifted spear the<br>demon flew at Yavakri, when he had been deprived of his water-pot and<br>rendered unclean. And seeing the demon approach with uplifted spear for<br>the purpose of slaying him, Yavakri rose up all on a sudden and fled<br>towards a tank. But finding it devoid of water, he hurried towards all<br>the rivers. But they too were all dried up. And being obstructed again<br>and again by the fierce demon, holding the spear, Yavakri in fright<br>attempted to enter into the Agnihotra room of his father. But there, O<br>king, he was repulsed by a blind Sudra warder, and he remained at the<br>door, grasped by the man. And, finding Yavakri thus grasped by the Sudra,<br>the demon hurled his spear at him, and thereupon he fell down dead,<br>pierced in the heart. After slaying Yavakri, the demon went back to<br>Raivya, and with the permission of that sage, began to live with the<br>female."
