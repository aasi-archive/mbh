                            "Draupadi said, 'I bow down unto Dhatri and Vidhatri who have thus<br>clouded thy sense! Regarding the burden (thou art to bear) thou thinkest<br>differently from the ways of thy fathers and grand-fathers! Influenced by<br>acts men are placed in different situations of life. Acts, therefore,<br>produce consequences that are inevitable; emancipation is desired from<br>mere folly. It seemeth that man can never attain prosperity in this world<br>by virtue, gentleness, forgiveness, straight-forwardness and fear of<br>censure! If this were not so, O Bharata, this insufferable calamity would<br>never have overtaken thee who art so undeserving of it, and these thy<br>brothers of great energy! Neither in those days of prosperity nor in<br>these days of thy adversity, thou, O Bharata, hath ever known anything so<br>dear to thee as virtue, which thou hast even regarded as dearer to thee<br>than life? That thy kingdom is for virtue alone, that thy life also is<br>for virtue alone, is known to Brahmanas and thy superiors and even the<br>celestials! I think thou canst abandon Bhimasena and Arjuna and these<br>twin sons of Madri along with myself but thou canst not abandon virtue! I<br>have heard that the king protecteth virtue; and virtue, protected by him,<br>protecteth him (in return)! I see, however, that virtue protecteth thee<br>not! Like the shadow pursuing a man, thy heart, O tiger among men, with<br>singleness of purpose, ever seeketh virtue. Thou hast never disregarded<br>thy equals, and inferiors and superiors. Obtaining even the entire world,<br>thy pride never increased! O son of Pritha, thou ever worshippest<br>Brahmanas, and gods, and the Pitris, with Swadhas, and other forms of<br>worship! O son of Pritha, thou hast ever gratified the Brahmanas by<br>fulfilling every wish of theirs! Yatis and Sannyasins and mendicants of<br>domestic lives have always been fed in thy house from off plates of gold<br>where I have distributed (food) amongst them. Unto the Vanaprasthas thou<br>always givest gold and food. There is nothing in thy house thou mayest<br>not give unto the Brahmanas! In the Viswadeva sacrifice, that is, for thy<br>peace, performed in thy house, the things consecrated are first offered<br>unto guests and all creatures while thou livest thyself with what<br>remaineth (after distribution)! Ishtis Pashubandhas, sacrifices for<br>obtaining fruition of desire, the religions rites of (ordinary)<br>domesticity, Paka sacrifices, and sacrifices of other kinds, are ever<br>performed in thy house. Even in this great forest, so solitary and<br>haunted by robbers, living in exile, divested of thy kingdom, thy virtue<br>hath sustained no diminution! The Aswamedha, the Rajasuya, the Pundarika,<br>and Gosava, these grand sacrifices requiring large gifts have all been<br>performed by thee! O monarch, impelled by a perverse sense during that<br>dire hour of a losing match at dice, thou didst yet stake and loss thy<br>kingdom, thy wealth, thy weapons, thy brothers, and myself! Simple,<br>gentle, liberal, modest, truthful, how, O king could thy mind be<br>attracted to the vice of gambling? I am almost deprived of my sense, O<br>king, and my heart is overwhelmed with grief, beholding this thy<br>distress, and this thy calamity! An old history is cited as an<br>illustration for the truth that men are subjects to the will of God and<br>never to their own wishes! The Supreme Lord and Ordainer of all ordaineth<br>everything in respect of the weal and woe, the happiness and misery, of<br>all creatures, even prior to their births guided by the acts of each,<br>which are even like a seed (destined to sprout forth into the tree of<br>life). O hero amongst men, as a wooden doll is made to move its limbs by<br>the wire-puller, so are creatures made to work by the Lord of all. O<br>Bharata, like space that covereth every object, God, pervading every<br>creature, ordaineth its weal or woe. Like a bird tied with a string,<br>every creature is dependent on God. Every one is subject to God and none<br>else. No one can be his own ordainer. Like a pearl on its string, or a<br>bull held fast by the cord passing through its nose, or a tree fallen<br>from the bank into the middle of the stream, every creature followeth the<br>command of the Creator, because imbued with His Spirit and because<br>established in Him. And man himself, dependent on the Universal Soul,<br>cannot pass a moment independently. Enveloped in darkness, creatures are<br>not masters of their own weal or woe. They go to heaven or hell urged by<br>God Himself. Like light straws dependent on strong winds, all creatures,<br>O Bharatas, are dependent on God! And God himself, pervading all<br>creatures and engaged in acts right and wrong, moveth in the universe,<br>though none can say This is God! This body with its physical attributes<br>is only the means by which God&#8212;the Supreme Lord of all maketh (every<br>creature) to reap fruits that are good or bad. Behold the power of<br>illusion that hath been spread by God, who confounding with his illusion,<br>maketh creatures slay their fellows! Truth-knowing Munis behold those<br>differently. They appear to them in a different light, even like the rays<br>of the Sun (which to ordinary eyes are only a pencil of light, while to<br>eyes more penetrating seem fraught with the germs of food and drink).<br>Ordinary men behold the things of the earth otherwise. It is God who<br>maketh them all, adopting different processes in their creation and<br>destruction. And, O Yudhishthira, the Self-create Grandsire, Almighty<br>God, spreading illusion, slayeth his creatures by the instrumentality of<br>his creatures, as one may break a piece of inert and senseless wood with<br>wood, or stone with stone, or iron with iron. And the Supreme Lord,<br>according to his pleasure, sporteth with His creatures, creating and<br>destroying them, like a child with his toy (of soft earth). O king, it<br>doth seem to me that God behaveth towards his creatures like a father or<br>mother unto them. Like a vicious person, He seemeth to bear himself<br>towards them in anger! Beholding superior and well-behaved and modest<br>persons persecuted, while the sinful are happy, I am sorely troubled.<br>Beholding this thy distress and the prosperity of Suyodhana, I do not<br>speak highly of the Great Ordainer who suffereth such inequality! O sir,<br>what fruits doth the Great Ordainer reap by granting prosperity to<br>Dhritarashtra's son who transgresseth the ordinances, who is crooked and<br>covetous, and who injureth virtue and religion! If the act done pursueth<br>the doer and none else, then certainly it is God himself who is stained<br>with the sin of every act. If however, the sin of an act done doth not<br>attach to the doer, then (individual) might (and not God) is the true<br>cause of acts, and I grieve for those that have no might!'"
