                            "Ashtavakra said, 'When no Brahmana is met with on the way, the way<br>belongeth to the blind, the deaf, the women, carriers of burden, and the<br>king respectively. But when a Brahmana is met with on the way, it<br>belongeth to him alone.' Thereupon the king said, 'I give the privilege<br>to enter. Do thou, therefore, go in by whatever way thou likest. No fire<br>ever so small is to be slighted. Even Indra himself boweth unto the<br>Brahmanas.' At this Ashtavakra said, 'We have come, O ruler of men, to<br>witness thy sacrificial ceremony and our curiosity, O king, is very<br>great. And we have come here as guests. We want the permission of thy<br>order (to enter). And, O son of Indradyumna, we have come, desirous of<br>seeing the sacrifice, and to meet king Janaka and speak to him. But thy<br>warder obstructs us and for this our anger burneth us like fever.' The<br>warder said, 'We carry out the orders of Vandin. Listen to what I have to<br>say. Lads are not permitted to enter here and it is only the learned old<br>Brahmanas that are allowed to enter.' Ashtavakra said. 'If this be the<br>condition, O warder, that the door is open to those only that are old,<br>then we have a right to enter. We are old and we have observed sacred<br>vows and are in possession of energy proceeding from the Vedic lore. And<br>we have served our superiors and subdued our passions&#8212;and have also won<br>proficiency in knowledge. It is said that even boys are not to be<br>slighted,&#8212;for a fire, small though it be, burneth on being touched.' The<br>warder replied, 'O young Brahmana, I consider you a boy, and therefore<br>recite, if you know, the verse demonstrating the existence of the Supreme<br>Being, and adored by the divine sages, and which, although composed of<br>one letter, is yet multifarious. Make no vain boast. Learned men are<br>really very rare.' Ashtavakra said, 'True growth cannot be inferred from<br>the mere development of the body, as the growth of the knots of the<br>Salmali tree cannot signify its age. That tree is called full-grown which<br>although slender and short, beareth fruits. But that which doth not bear<br>fruits, is not considered as grown.' The warder said, 'Boys receive<br>instruction from the old and they also in time grow old. Knowledge<br>certainly is not attainable in a short time. "Wherefore then being a<br>child, dost thou talk like an old man?' Then Ashtavakra said, 'One is not<br>old because his head is gray. But the gods regard him as old who,<br>although a child in years, is yet possessed of knowledge. The sages have<br>not laid down that a man's merit consists in years, or gray hair, or<br>wealth, or friends. To us he is great who is versed in the Vedas. I have<br>come here, O porter, desirous of seeing Vandin in the court. Go and<br>inform king Janaka, who hath a garland of lotuses on his neck, that I am<br>here. Thou shalt to-day see me enter into a dispute with the learned men,<br>and defeat Vandin in a controversy. And when others have been silenced,<br>the Brahmanas of matured learning and the king also with his principal<br>priests, bear witness to the superior or the inferior quality of my<br>attainments.' The warder said, 'How canst thou, who art but in thy tenth<br>year, hope to enter into this sacrifice, into which learned and educated<br>men only are admitted? I shall, however, try some means for thy<br>admittance. Do thou also try thyself'. Ashtavakra then addressing the<br>king said, 'O king, O foremost of Janaka's race, thou art the paramount<br>sovereign and all power reposeth in thee. In times of old, king Yayati<br>was the celebrator of sacrifices. And in the present age, thou it is that<br>art performer thereof. We have heard that the learned Vandin, after<br>defeating (in controversy) men expert in discussion, causeth them to be<br>drowned by faithful servants employed by thee. Hearing this, I have come<br>before these Brahmanas, to expound the doctrine of the unity of the<br>Supreme Being. Where is now Vandin? Tell me so that I may approach him,<br>and destroy him, even as the sun destroyeth the stars. Thereupon the king<br>said, 'Thou hopest, O Brahmana, to defeat Vandin, not knowing his power<br>of speech. Can those who are familiar with his power, speak as thou dost?<br>He hath been sounded by Brahmanas versed in the Vedas. Thou hopest to<br>defeat Vandin, only because thou knowest not his powers (of speech). Many<br>a Brahmana hath waned before him, even as the stars before the sun.<br>Desirous of defeating him, people proud of their learning, have lost<br>their glory on appearing before him, and have retired from his presence,<br>without even venturing to speak with the members of the assembly.'<br>Ashtavakra said, 'Vandin hath never entered into disputation with a man<br>like myself, and it is for this only that he looketh upon himself as a<br>lion, and goeth about roaring like one. But to-day meeting me he will lie<br>down dead, even like a cart on the highway, of which the wheels have been<br>deranged.' The king said, 'He alone is a truly learned man who<br>understandeth the significance of the thing that hath thirty divisions,<br>twelve parts twentyfour joints, and three hundred and sixty spokes.'<br>Ashtavakra said, 'May that ever-moving wheel that hath twentyfour joints,<br>six naves, twelve peripheries, and sixty spokes protect thee![19]' The<br>king said, 'Who amongst the gods beareth those two which go together like<br>two mares (yoked to a car), and sweep like a hawk, and to what also do<br>they give birth?' Ashtavakra said, 'May God, O king, forfend the presence<br>of these two[20] in thy house; aye, even in the house of thine enemies.<br>He who appeareth, having for his charioteer the wind,[21] begetteth them,<br>and they also produce him.' Thereupon the king said, 'What is that doth<br>not close its eyes even while sleeping; what is it that doth not move,<br>even when born; what is it that hath no heart; and what doth increase<br>even in its own speed?' Ashtavakra said, 'It is a fish[22] that doth not<br>close its eye-lids, while sleeping; and it is an a egg[23] that doth not<br>move when produced; it is stone[24] that hath no heart; and it is a<br>river[25] that increase in its own speed.'<br><br>"The king said, 'It seemeth, O possessor of divine energy, that thou art<br>no human being. I consider thee not a boy, but a matured man; there is no<br>other man who can compare with thee in the art of speech. I therefore<br>give thee admittance. There is Vandin.'"
