                            "Markandeya said, 'The illustrious Dhundhu, O king, was the son of Madhu<br>and Kaitabha, and possessed of great energy and prowess, he underwent<br>ascetic penances of great austerity and he stood erect on one leg and<br>reduced his body to a mass of only veins and arteries, and Brahma,<br>gratified with him, gave him a boon. And the boon he had asked of the<br>lord Prajapati was in these words, 'Let no one among the gods, the<br>Danavas, the Rakshas, the Snakes, the Gandharvas and the Rakshasas be<br>capable of slaying me. Even this is the boon that I ask of thee.' And the<br>Grandsire replied unto him saying, 'Let it be as thou wishest. Go thy<br>way.' And thus addressed by the Grandsire, the Danava placed the feet of<br>the Deity on his head and having thus touched with reverence the Deity's<br>feet he went away and possessed of mighty energy and prowess. Dhundhu,<br>having obtained the boon hastily approached Vishnu remembering the death<br>of his father at the hands of that Deity, and the wrathful Dhundhu having<br>vanquished the gods with the Gandharvas began to distress all the<br>celestials with Vishnu at their head. And at last O bull of the Bharata<br>race, that wicked souled Asura arriving at a sea of sands known by the<br>name of Ujjalaka, began to distress to the utmost of his might the asylum<br>of Utanka. And endued with fierce energy, Dhundhu, the son of Madhu and<br>Kaitabha, lay in his subterranean cave underneath the sands in the<br>observance of fierce ascetic and severe austerities with the object of<br>destroying the triple world, and while the Asura lay breathing near the<br>asylum of Utanka that Rishi possessed of the splendour of fire, king<br>Kualaswa with his troops, accompanied by the Brahmana Utanka, as also by<br>all his sons set out for that region, O bull of the Bharata race! And<br>after that grinder of foes, the royal Kuvalaswa, had set out, accompanied<br>by his twenty-one thousand sons all of whom were exceedingly powerful,<br>the illustrious Lord Vishnu filled him with his own energy at the command<br>of Utanka and impelled by the desire of benefiting the triple world and<br>while that invincible hero was proceeding on his way and loud voice was<br>heard in the sky repeating the words, 'This fortunate and unslayable one<br>will become the destroyer of Dhundhu to-day.' And the gods began to<br>shower upon him celestial flowers. And the celestial kettle drums began<br>to sound their music although none played upon them. And during the march<br>of that wise one, cool breezes began to blow and the chief of the<br>celestials poured gentle showers wetting the dust on the roads and, O<br>Yudhishthira, the cars of the celestials could be seen high over the spot<br>where the mighty Asura Dhundhu was. The gods and Gandharvas and great<br>Rishis urged by curiosity, came there to behold the encounter between<br>Dhundhu and Kuvalaswa and, O thou of the Kuru race, filled by Narayana<br>with his own energy, king Kuvalaswa, aided by his sons, soon surrounded<br>that sea of sands and the king ordered that wilderness to be excavated<br>and after the king's sons had excavated that sea of sands for seven days,<br>they could see the mighty Asura Dhundhu. And, O bull of the Bharata race,<br>the huge body of that Asura lay within those sands, effulgent in its own<br>energy like the Sun himself. And Dhundhu, O king, was lying covering the<br>western region of the desert and surrounded on all sides by the sons of<br>Kuvalaswa, the Danava was assaulted with sharp-pointed shafts and maces<br>and heavy and short clubs and axes and clubs, with iron spikes and darts<br>and bright and keen-edged swords, and thus assaulted, the mighty Danava<br>rose from his recumbent posture in wrath. And enraged, the Asura began to<br>swallow those various weapons that were hurled at him and he vomited from<br>his mouth fiery flames like unto those of the fire called Samvarta that<br>appeareth at the end of the Yuga and by those flames of his, the Asura<br>consumed all the sons of the king and, O tiger among men, like the Lord<br>Kapila of old consuming the sons of king Sagara, the infuriated Asura<br>overwhelming the triple world with the flames vomited from his mouth,<br>achieved that wonderful feat in a moment. And, O thou best of the<br>Bharatas, when all those sons of king Kuvalaswa were consumed by the fire<br>emitted by the Asura in wrath, the monarch, possessed as he was of mighty<br>energy, then approached the Danava who, like unto a second Kumbhakarna of<br>mighty energy, had come to the encounter after waking from his slumbers.<br>From the body of the king, O monarch, then began to flow a mighty and<br>copious stream of water and that stream soon extinguished, O king, the<br>fiery flames emitted by the Asura. And, O great king, the royal<br>Kuvalaswa, filled with Yoga force, having extinguished those flames by<br>the water that issued from his body, consumed that Daitya of wicked<br>prowess with the celebrated weapon called Brahma for relieving the triple<br>world of its fears, and the royal sage Kuvalaswa, having consumed that<br>great Asura, that foe of the celestials and slayer of all enemies, by<br>means of that weapon became like unto a second chief of the triple world<br>and the high-souled king Kuvalaswa having slain the the Asura Dhundhu,<br>became from that time known by the name of Dhundhumara and from that time<br>he came to be regarded as invincible in battle, and the gods and the<br>great Rishis who had come to witness that encounter were so far gratified<br>with him that they addressed him saying, 'Ask thou a boon of us!' And<br>thus solicited by the gods, the king bowed to them and filled with joy,<br>the king said unto them, with joined hands these words, 'Let me be always<br>able to give wealth unto superior Brahmanas! Let me be invincible as<br>regards all foes! Let there be friendship between myself and Vishnu! Let<br>me have no ill-feeling towards any creature! Let my heart always turn to<br>virtue! And let me (finally) dwell in heaven for ever!' And the gods and<br>the Rishis and Utanka, hearing this were exceedingly gratified and all of<br>them said, 'Let it be as thou wishest!' And, O king, having also blessed<br>him with many other speeches, the gods and the great Rishis then went<br>away to their respective abodes. And, O Yudhishthira, after the slaughter<br>of all his sons, king Kuvalaswa had still three sons left, and, O thou of<br>the Bharata race, they were called Dridaswa and Kapilaswa and Chandraswa.<br>It is from them, O king, that the illustrious line of kings belonging to<br>Ikshvaku's race, all possessed of immeasurable prowess, hath sprung.<br><br>"It was thus, O best of king, that that great Daitya of the name Dhundhu,<br>the son of Madhu and Kaitabha was slain by Kuvalaswa and it was for this<br>also that king came to be called by the name of Dhundhumara. And indeed,<br>the name he assumed was no empty one but was literally true.<br><br>"I have now told thee all that thou hadst asked me, viz., all about that<br>person in consequence of whose act the story of Dhundhu's death hath<br>become famous. He that listeneth to this holy history connected with the<br>glory of Vishnu, becometh virtuous and obtaineth children. By listening<br>to this story on particular lunations, one becometh blessed with long<br>life and great good fortune. And freed from every anxiety one ceaseth to<br>have any fear of diseases."
