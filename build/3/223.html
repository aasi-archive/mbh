                            "The lady replied, 'I am a daughter of Prajapati (the lord of all<br>creatures, Brahma) and my name is Devasena. My sister Daityasena has ere<br>this been ravished by Kesin. We two sisters with our maids habitually<br>used to come to these Manasa mountains for pleasures with the permission<br>of Prajapati. And the great Asura Kesin used daily to pay his court to<br>us. Daityasena, O conqueror of Paka, listened to him, but I did not.<br>Daityasena was, therefore, taken away by him, but, O illustrious one,<br>thou hast rescued me with thy might. And now, O lord of the celestials, I<br>desire that thou shouldst select an invincible husband for me.' To this<br>Indra replied, 'Thou art a cousin of mine, thy mother being a sister of<br>my mother Dakshayani, and now I desire to hear thee relate thine own<br>prowess.' The lady replied, 'O hero with long arms, I am Avala[70] (weak)<br>but my husband must be powerful. And by the potency of my father's boon,<br>he will be respected by gods and Asuras alike.' Indra said, 'O blameless<br>creature, I wish to hear from thee, what sort of power thou wishest thy<br>husband to possess.' The lady replied, 'That manly and famous and<br>powerful being devoted to Brahma, who is able to conquer all the<br>celestials, Asuras, Yakshas, Kinnaras, Uragas, Rakshasas, and the<br>evil-minded Daityas and to subdue all the worlds with thee, shall be my<br>husband.'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'On hearing her speech, Indra was grieved and<br>deeply thought within himself, 'There is no husband for this lady,<br>answering to her own description.' And that god adorned with sun-like<br>effulgence, then perceived the Sun rising on the Udaya hill,[71] and the<br>great Soma (Moon) gliding into the Sun. It being the time of the new<br>Moon, he of a hundred sacrifices, at the Raudra[72] moment, observed the<br>gods and Asuras fighting on the Sunrise hill. And he saw that the morning<br>twilight was tinged with red clouds. And he also saw that the abode of<br>Varuna had become blood-red. And he also observed Agni conveying<br>oblations offered with various hymns by Bhrigu, Angiras, and others and<br>entering the disc of the Sun. And he further saw the twenty four Parvas<br>adorning the Sun, and the terrible Soma also present in the Sun under<br>such surroundings. And observing this union of the Sun and the Moon and<br>that fearful conjunction of theirs, Sakra thought within himself, This<br>terrific conjunction of the Sun and the Moon forebodeth a fearful battle<br>on the morrow. And the river Sindhu (Indus) too is flowing with a current<br>of fresh blood and the jackals with fiery laces are crying to the Sun.<br>This great conjunction is fearful and full of energy. This union of the<br>Moon (Soma) with the Sun and Agni is very wonderful. And if Soma giveth<br>birth to a son now, that son may become the husband of this lady. And<br>Agni also hath similar surroundings now, and he too is a god. If the two<br>begetteth a son, that son, may become the husband of this lady.' With<br>these thoughts that illustrious celestial repaired to the regions of<br>Brahma, taking Devasena[73] with him. And saluting the Grandsire he said<br>unto him, 'Do thou fix a renowned warrior as husband of this lady.'<br>Brahma replied, 'O slayer of Asuras, it shall be; as thou hast intended.<br>The issue of that union will be mighty and powerful accordingly. That<br>powerful being will be the husband of this lady and the joint leader of<br>thy forces with thee.' Thus addressed, the lord of the celestials and the<br>lady bowed unto him and then repaired to the place where those great<br>Brahmanas, the powerful celestial Rishis, Vasistha and others, lived. And<br>with Indra at their head, the other gods also, desirous of drinking the<br>Soma beverage, repaired to the sacrifices of those Rishis to receive<br>their respective shares of the offerings. Having duly performed the<br>ceremonies with the bright blazing fire, those great-minded persons<br>offered oblations to the celestials. And the Adbhuta fire, that carrier<br>of oblations, was invited with mantras. And coming out of the solar disc,<br>that lordly fire duly repaired thither, restraining speech. And, O chief<br>of Bharata's race, that fire entering the sacrificial fire that had been<br>ignited and into which various offerings were made by the Rishis with<br>recitations of hymns, took them with him and made them over to the<br>dwellers of heaven. And while returning from that place, he observed the<br>wives of those high-souled Rishis sleeping at their ease on their beds.<br>And those ladies had a complexion beautiful like that of an altar of<br>gold, spotless like moon-beams, resembling fiery flames and looking like<br>blazing stars. And seeing those wives of the illustrious Brahmanas with<br>eager eyes, his mind became agitated and he was smitten with their<br>charms. Restraining his heart he considered it improper for him to be<br>thus agitated. And he said unto himself, The wives of these great<br>Brahmanas are chaste and faithful and beyond the reach of other people's<br>desires. I am filled with desire to possess them. I cannot lawfully cast<br>my eyes upon them, nor ever touch them when they are not filled with<br>desire. I shall, therefore, gratify myself daily with only looking at<br>them by becoming their Garhapatya (house-hold) fire.'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, The Adbhuta fire, thus transforming himself into a<br>house-hold one, was highly gratified with seeing those gold-complexioned<br>ladies and touching them with his flames. And influenced by their charms<br>he dwelt there for a long time, giving them his heart and filled with an<br>intense love for them. And baffled in all his efforts to win the hearts<br>of those Brahmana ladies, and his own heart tortured by love, he repaired<br>to a forest with the certain object of destroying himself. A little while<br>before, Swaha, the daughter of Daksha, had bestowed her love on him. The<br>excellent lady had been endeavouring for a long time to detect his weak<br>moments; but that blameless lady did not succeed in finding out any<br>weakness in the calm and collected fire-god. But now that the god had<br>betaken himself to a forest, actually tortured by the pangs of love, she<br>thought, 'As I too am distressed with love, I shall assume the guise of<br>the wives of the seven Rishis, and in that disguise I shall seek the<br>fire-god so smitten with their charms. This done, he will be gratified<br>and my desire too will be satisfied.'"
