                            "Vasudeva continued, 'O bull of the Bharata race, having spoken thus unto<br>the Yadavas, the son of Rukmini (Pradyumna) ascended his golden car. And<br>the car he rode was drawn by excellent steeds in mail. And over it stood<br>a standard bearing the figure of a Makara with gaping mouth and fierce as<br>Yama. And with his steeds, more flying than running on the ground, he<br>rushed against the foe And the hero equipped with quiver and sword, with<br>fingers cased in leather, twanged his bow possessed of the splendour of<br>the lightning, with great strength, and transferring it from hand to<br>hand, as if in contempt of the enemy, spread confusion among the Danavas<br>and other warriors of the city of Saubha. And as hot in contempt of the,<br>foe, and continuously slew the Danavas in battle, no one could mark the<br>slightest interval between his successive shafts. And the colour of his<br>face changed not, and his limbs trembled not. And people only heard his<br>loud leonine roars indicative of wonderful valour. And the aquatic<br>monster with mouth wide open, that devourer of all fishes, placed on<br>golden flag-staff of that best of cars, struck terror into the hearts of<br>Salwa's warriors. And, O king, Pradyumna, the mower of foes rushed with<br>speed against Salwa himself so desirous of an encounter! And, O<br>perpetuator of the Kuru race, braved by the heroic Pradyumna in that<br>mighty battle, the angry Salwa could ill bear the challenge! And that<br>conqueror of hostile cities, Salwa, maddened by anger, descended from his<br>beautiful car of unchecked speed, resolved to encounter Pradyumna. And<br>the people beheld the fight between Salwa and the foremost of Vrishni<br>heroes, which was even like unto the encounter between Vasava with Vali.<br>And, O hero, mounting on his beautiful car decked with gold and furnished<br>with flags and flag-staffs and quivers, the illustrious and mighty Salwa<br>began to discharge his arrows at Pradyumna! Pradyumna also by the energy<br>of his arms, overwhelmed Salwa in the combat by a thick shower of arrows.<br>The king of Saubha, however, thus attacked in battle by Pradyumna,<br>endured him not, but discharged at my son arrows that were like blazing<br>fire. But the mighty Pradyumna parried off that arrowy shower. Beholding<br>this, Salwa rained on my son other weapons of blazing splendour. Then, O<br>foremost of monarchs, pierced by the shafts of Salwa, the son of Rukmini<br>discharged without loss of time an arrow that was capable of entering the<br>vitals of a foe in fight. And that winged shaft shot by my son, piercing<br>Salwa's mail, entered his heart&#8212;whereupon he fell down, in a swoon. And<br>beholding the heroic king Salwa fallen down deprived of sense, the<br>foremost of the Danavas fled away rending the ground beneath their feet.<br>And, O lord of the earth, the army of Salwa sent up exclamations of Oh!<br>and Alas! seeing their king, the lord of Saubha, drop down bereft of<br>sense! And O son of the Kuru race, regaining his senses, the mighty Salwa<br>rose and all of a sudden discharged his arrows on Pradyumna. Then the<br>heroic and mighty armed Pradyumna, sorely pierced by his adversary about<br>his throat, was enfeebled on his car. And, O mighty king, wounding the<br>son of Rukmini, Salwa sent up a shout like unto the roar of a lion, and<br>filling the entire earth with it! And, O Bharata, when my son became<br>senseless, Salwa, without losing a moment, again discharged at him other<br>shafts difficult to bear. And pierced with numberless arrows and deprived<br>of his senses, Pradyumna, O chief of the Kuru race, became motionless on<br>the field of battle!'"
