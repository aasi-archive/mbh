                            "Lomasa said, 'At that very time, the mighty king, Vrihadyumna, of high<br>fortune, who was the Yajamana of Raivya, commenced a sacrifice. And the<br>two sons of Raivya, Arvavasu and Paravasu, were engaged by that<br>intelligent monarch, to assist him in the performance of the ceremony.<br>And, O son of Kunti, taking the permission of their father, they two went<br>to the sacrifice, while Raivya with Paravasu's wife remained in the<br>hermitage. And it came to pass that one day, desirous of seeing his wife.<br>Paravasu returned home alone. And he met his father in the wood, wrapped<br>in the skin of a black antelope. And the night was far advanced and dark;<br>and Paravasu, blinded by drowsiness in that deep wood, mistook his father<br>for a straggling deer. And mistaking him for a deer, Paravasu, for the<br>sake of personal safety, unintentionally killed his father. Then, O son<br>of Bharata, after performing the funeral rites (of his father), he<br>returned to the sacrifice and there addressed his brother saying, 'Thou<br>wilt never be able to perform this task unassisted. I again, have killed<br>our father, mistaking him for a deer. O brother, for me do thou observe a<br>vow, prescribed in the case of killing a Brahmana. O Muni, I shall be<br>able to perform this work (sacrifice), without any assistant.' Arvavasu<br>said, 'Do thou then thyself officiate at this sacrifice of the gifted<br>Vrihadyumna; and for thee will I, bringing my senses under perfect<br>control, observe the vow prescribed in the case of slaying a Brahmana.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'Having observed the vow relative to the killing of a<br>Brahmana, the sage Arvavasu came back to the sacrifice. Seeing his<br>brother arrive, Paravasu, in accents choked with malice, addressed<br>Vrihadyumna, saying, 'O king, see that this slayer of a Brahmana enter<br>not into thy sacrifice, nor look at it. Even by a glance, the killer of a<br>Brahmana can, without doubt, do thee harm.' O lord of men, immediately on<br>hearing this, the king ordered his attendants (to turn out Arvavasu). O<br>king, on being driven out by the king's attendants, and repeatedly<br>addressed by them&#8212;'O slayer of  a Brahmana&#8212;Arvavasu more than once<br>cried, 'It is not I that have killed a Brahmana. Not did he own that he<br>had observed the vow for his own sake. He said that his brother had<br>committed the sin, and that he had freed him therefrom.' Having said this<br>in anger, and being reprimanded by the attendants, the Brahmana sage of<br>austere penances, retired in silence into the woods. There betaking<br>himself to the severest penances, the great Brahmana sought the<br>protection of the Sun. Thereupon, the revelation teaching the mantra<br>relative to the worship of the Sun, became manifest unto him and that<br>eternal deity who obtaineth his share (of the sacrificial butter) first,<br>appeared before him in an embodied form.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'The celestials, O king, were well pleased with Arvavasu<br>for his acts. And they made him engaged as the chief priest in the<br>sacrifice (of Vrihadyumna), and Paravasu to be dismissed from it. Then<br>Agni and the other celestials (of their own accord) bestowed boons on<br>Arvavasu. And they also prayed that his father might be restored to life.<br>He further prayed that his brother might be absolved from his sin; that<br>his father might have no recollection of his having been slain; that<br>Bharadwaja and Yavakri might both be restored to life; and that the solar<br>revelation might attain celebrity (on earth). Then the god said, 'So be<br>it,' and conferred on him other boons also. Thereat, O Yudhishthira, all<br>of these persons regained their life. Yavakri now addressed Agni and the<br>other deities, saying, 'I had obtained a knowledge of all the Vedas, and<br>also practised penances. How came it then, O chiefs of the immortals,<br>that Raivya succeeded in killing me in that way?' Thereupon the gods<br>said, 'O Yavakri, never act again as those have done. What thou askest<br>about is quite possible, for thou hast learnt the Vedas without exertion,<br>and without the help of a preceptor. But this man (Raivya) bearing<br>various troubles, had satisfied his preceptor by his conduct, and<br>obtained (from the latter) the excellent Vedas through great exertions<br>and in a long time.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'Having said this to Yavakri, and restored all those to<br>life, the celestials with Indra at their head, ascended to heaven. Here,<br>O Yudhishthira, is the sacred hermitage of that sage embellished with<br>trees bearing blossoms and fruits at all seasons. O tiger among kings,<br>dwelling at this spot, thou wilt be delivered from all thy sins.'"
