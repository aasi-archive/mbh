                            "Markandeya continued, 'Vrishaspati had a wife (called Tara) belonging to<br>the lunar world. By her, he had six sons partaking of the energy of fire,<br>and one daughter. The fire in whose honour oblations of clarified butter<br>are offered at the Paurnamasya and other sacrifices, was a son of<br>Vrishaspati called Sanju; he was of great ascetic merit. At the<br>Chaturmasya (four-monthly) and Aswamedha (horse) sacrifices, animals are<br>offered first in his honour, and this powerful fire is indicated by<br>numerous flames. Sanju's wife was called Satya, she was of matchless<br>beauty and she sprang from Dharma (righteousness) for the sake of truth.<br>The blazing fire was his son, and he had three daughters of great<br>religious merit. The fire which is honoured with the first oblations at<br>sacrifices is his first son called Bharadwaja. The second son of Sanju is<br>called Bharata in whose honour oblations of clarified butter are offered<br>with the sacrificial ladle (called Sruk) at all the full moon<br>(Paurnamasaya) sacrifices. Beside these, three sons of whom Bharata is<br>the senior, he had a son named Bharata and a daughter called Bharati. The<br>Bharata fire is the son of Prajapati Bharata Agni (fire). And, O ornament<br>of Bharata's race, because he is greatly honoured, he is also called the<br>great. Vira is Bharadwaja's wife; she gave birth to Vira. It is said by<br>the Brahmanas that he is worshipped like Soma (with the same hymns) with<br>offerings of clarified butter. He is joined with Soma in the secondary<br>oblation of clarified butter and is also called Rathaprabhu, Rathadhwana<br>and Kumbhareta. He begot a son named Siddhi by his wife Sarayu, and<br>enveloped the sun with his splendour and from being the presiding genius<br>of the fire sacrifice he is ever mentioned in the hymns in praise of<br>fire. And the fire Nischyavana praises the earth only; he never suffers<br>in reputation, splendour and prosperity. The sinless fire Satya blazing<br>with pure flame is his son. He is free from all taint and is not defiled<br>by sin, and is the regulator of time. That fire has another name<br>Nishkriti, because he accomplished the Nishkriti (relief) of all blatant<br>creatures here. When properly worshipped he vouchsafes good fortune. His<br>son is called Swana, who is the generator of all diseases; he inflicts<br>severe sufferings on people for which they cry aloud, and moves in the<br>intelligence of the whole universe. And the other fire (Vrihaspati's<br>third son) is called Viswajit by men of spiritual wisdom. The fire, which<br>is known as the internal heat by which the food of all creatures is<br>digested, is the fourth son of Vrihaspati known through all the worlds, O<br>Bharata, by the name of Viswabhuk. He is self-restrained, of great<br>religious merit, and is a Brahmacharin and he is worshipped by Brahmanas<br>at the Paka-sacrifices. The sacred river Gomati was his wife and by her<br>all religious-minded men perform their rites. And that terrible<br>water-drinking sea fire called Vadava is the fifth son of Vrihaspati.<br>This Brahmic fire has a tendency to move upwards and hence it is called<br>Urdhvabhag, and is seated in the vital air called Prana. The sixth son is<br>called the great Swishtakrit; for by him oblations became swishta (su,<br>excellently, and ishta, offered) and the udagdhara oblation is always<br>made in his honour. And when all creatures are claimed, the fire called<br>Manyauti becomes filled with fury. This inexorably terrible and highly<br>irascible fire is the daughter of Vrihaspati, and is known as Swaha and<br>is present in all matter. (By the respective influence of the three<br>qualities of sattwa, rajas and tamas, Swaha had three sons). By reason of<br>the first she had a son who was equalled by none in heaven in personal<br>beauty, and from this fact he was surnamed by the gods as the<br>Kama-fire.[65] (By reason of the second) she had a son called the Amogha<br>or invincible fire, the destroyer of his enemies in battle. Assured of<br>success he curbs his anger and is armed with a bow and seated on a<br>chariot and adorned with wreaths of flowers. (From the action of the<br>third quality) she had a son, the great Uktha (the means of salvation)<br>praised by (akin to) three Ukthas.[66] He is the originator of the great<br>word[67] and is therefore known as the Samaswasa or the means of rest<br>(salvation).'"
