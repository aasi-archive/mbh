                            "Markandeya continued, 'The Deity then said, 'O Brahmana, the gods even<br>do not know me truly! As however, I have been gratified with thee, I will<br>tell thee how I created the universe! O regenerate Rishi, thou art<br>devoted to thy ancestors and hast also sought my protection! Thou hast<br>also beheld me with thy eyes, and thy ascetic merit also is great! In<br>ancient times I called the waters by the name of Nara; and because the<br>waters have ever been my ayana or home, therefore have I been called<br>Narayana (the water-homed). O best of regenerate ones, I am Narayana, the<br>Source of all things, the Eternal, the Unchangeable. I am the Creator of<br>all things, and the Destroyer also of all. I am Vishnu, I am Brahma and I<br>am Sakra, the chief of the gods. I am king Vaisravana, and I am Yama, the<br>lord of the deceased spirits. I am Siva, I am Soma, and I am Kasyapa the<br>lord of the created things. And, O best of regenerate ones, I am he<br>called Dhatri, and he also that is called Vidhatri, and I am Sacrifice<br>embodied. Fire is my mouth, the earth my feet, and the Sun and the Moon<br>are my eyes; the Heaven is the crown of my head, the firmament and the<br>cardinal points are my ears; the waters are born of my sweat. Space with<br>the cardinal points are my body, and the Air is my mind. I have performed<br>many hundreds of sacrifices with gifts in profusion. I am always present<br>in the sacrifices of the gods; and they that are cognisant of the Vedas<br>and officiate therein, make their offerings to me. On earth the Kshatriya<br>chiefs that rule over men, in performing their sacrifices from desire of<br>obtaining heaven, and the Vaisyas also in performing theirs from desire<br>of winning those happy regions, all worship me at such times and by those<br>ceremonials. It is I who, assuming the form of Sesha support (on my head)<br>this earth bounded by the four seas and decked by Meru and Mandara. And O<br>regenerate one, it is I who, assuming the form of a boar, had raised in<br>days of yore this earth sunk in water. And, O best of Brahmanas, it is I<br>who, becoming the fire that issues out of the Equine mouth, drink up the<br>waters (of the ocean) and create them again. In consequence of my energy<br>from my mouth, my arms, my thighs, and my feet gradually sprang Brahmanas<br>and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras. It is from me that the Rik, the<br>Sama, the Yajus, and the Atharvan Vedas spring, and it is in me that they<br>all enter when the time cometh. Brahmanas devoted to asceticism, they<br>that value Peace as the highest attribute, they that have their souls<br>under complete control, they that are desirous of knowledge, they that<br>are freed from lust and wrath and envy, they that are unwedded to things<br>of the earth, they that have their sins completely washed away, they that<br>are possessed of gentleness and virtue, and are divested of pride, they<br>that have a full knowledge of the Soul, all worship me with profound<br>meditation. I am the flame known as Samvartaka, I am the Wind called by<br>that name, I am the Sun wearing that appellation, and I am the fire that<br>hath that designation. And, O best of Brahmanas, those things that are<br>seen in the firmament as stars, know them to be the pores of my skin. The<br>ocean&#8212;those mines of gems and the four cardinal points, know, O<br>Brahmana, are my robes, my bed, and my home. By me have they been<br>distributed for serving the purposes of the gods. And, O best of men,<br>know also that lust, wrath, joy, fear, and the over-clouding of the<br>intellect, are all different forms of myself. And, O Brahmana, whatever<br>is obtained by men by the practice of truth, charity, ascetic<br>austerities, and peace and harmlessness towards all creatures, and such<br>other handsome deeds, is obtained because of my arrangements. Governed by<br>my ordinance, men wander within my body, their senses overwhelmed by me.<br>They move not according to their will but as they are moved by me.<br>Regenerate Brahmanas that have thoroughly studied the Vedas, that have<br>tranquillity in their souls, they that have subdued their wrath, obtain a<br>high reward by means of their numerous sacrifices. That reward, however,<br>is unattainable by men that are wicked in their deeds, overwhelmed by<br>covetousness, mean and disreputable with souls unblessed and impure.<br>Therefore, must thou know, O Brahmana that this reward which is obtained<br>by persons having their souls under control and which is unobtainable by<br>the ignorant and the foolish,&#8212;this which is attainable by asceticism<br>alone,&#8212;is productive of high merit. And, O best of men, at those times<br>when virtue and morality decrease and sin and immorality increase, I<br>create myself in new forms. And, O Muni, when fierce and malicious<br>Daityas and Rakshasas that are incapable of being slain by even the<br>foremost of the gods, are born on earth, I then take my birth in the<br>families of virtuous men, and assuming human body restore tranquillity by<br>exterminating all evils. Moved by my own maya, I create gods and men, and<br>Gandharvas and Rakshasas, and all immobile things and then destroy them<br>all myself (when the time cometh). For the preservation of rectitude and<br>morality I assume a human form, and when the season for action cometh, I<br>again assume forms that are inconceivable. In the Krita age I become<br>white, in the Treta age I become yellow, in the Dwapara I have become red<br>and in the Kali age I become dark in hue, I the Kali age, the proportion<br>of immorality becometh three-fourths, (a fourth only being that of<br>morality). And when the end of the Yuga cometh, assuming the fierce form<br>of Death, alone I destroy all the three worlds with their mobile and<br>immobile existences. With three steps, I cover the whole Universe; I am<br>the Soul of the universe; I am the source of all happiness; I am the<br>humbler of all pride; I am omnipresent; I am infinite; I am the Lord of<br>the senses; and my prowess is great. O Brahmana, alone do I set a-going<br>the wheel of Time; I am formless; I am the Destroyer of all creatures;<br>and I am the cause of all efforts of all my creatures. O best of Munis,<br>my soul completely pervadeth all my creatures, but, O foremost of all<br>regenerate ones, no one knoweth me. It is me that the pious and the<br>devoted worship in all the worlds. O regenerate one, whatever of pain<br>thou hast felt within my stomach, know, O sinless one, that all that is<br>for thy happiness and good fortune. And whatever of mobile and immobile<br>objects thou hast seen in the world, everything hath been ordained by my<br>Soul which is the Spring of all existence. The grandsire of all creatures<br>is half my body; I am called Narayana, and I am bearer of the<br>conch-shell, the discus and the mace. O regenerate Rishi, for a period<br>measured by a thousand times the length of the Yugas, I who am the<br>Universal Soul sleep overwhelming all creatures in insensibility. And, O<br>best of regenerate Rishis, I stay here thus for all time, in the form of<br>a boy though I am old, until Brahma waketh up. O foremost of Brahmanas,<br>gratified with thee, I who am Brahma have repeatedly granted thee boons,<br>O thou who art worshipped by regenerate Rishis! Beholding one vast<br>expanse of water and seeing that all mobile and immobile creatures have<br>been destroyed, thou wert afflicted with melancholy. I know this, and it<br>is for this that I showed thee the universe (within my stomach). And<br>while thou wert within my body, beholding the entire universe, thou wert<br>filled with wonder and deprived of thy senses. O regenerate Rishi, it is<br>for this that thou wert speedily brought out by me through my mouth. I<br>have (now) told thee of that Soul which is incapable of being<br>comprehended by the gods and the Asuras. And as long as that great<br>ascetic, the holy Brahma, doth not awake, thou, O regenerate Rishi, canst<br>happily and trustfully dwell here. And when that Grandsire of all<br>creatures awaketh up, I will then, O best of Brahmanas, alone create all<br>creatures endued with bodies, the firmament, the earth, light, the<br>atmosphere, water, and indeed all else of mobile and immobile creatures<br>(that thou mayst have seen) on the earth!'<br><br>'Markandeya continued, 'Having said so unto me that wonderful Deity<br>vanished, O son, from my sight! I then beheld this varied and wondrous<br>creation start into life. O king, O thou foremost of the Bharata race, I<br>witnessed all this, so wonderful, O thou foremost of all virtuous men, at<br>the end of the Yuga! And the Deity, of eyes large as lotus leaves, seen<br>by me, in days of yore is this tiger among men, this Janardana who hath<br>become thy relative! It is in consequence of the boon granted to me by<br>this one that memory doth not fail me, that the period of my life, O son<br>of Kunti, is so long and death itself is under my control. This is that<br>ancient and supreme Lord Hari of inconceivable soul who hath taken his<br>birth as Krishna of the Vrishni race, and who endued with mighty arms,<br>seemeth to sport in this world! This one is Dhatri and Vidhatri, the<br>Destroyer of all the Eternal, the bearer of the Sreevatsa mark on his<br>breast, the Lord of the lord of all creatures, the highest of the high,<br>called also Govinda! Beholding this foremost of all gods, this<br>ever-victorious Being, attired in yellow robes, this chief of the Vrishni<br>race, my recollection cometh back to me! This Madhava is the father and<br>mother of all creatures! Ye bulls of the Kuru race, seek ye the refuge of<br>this Protector!'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed, the sons of Pritha and those<br>bulls among men&#8212;the twins, along with Draupadi, all bowed down unto<br>Janardana. And that tiger among men deserving of every respect thus<br>revered by the sons of Pandu, then consoled them all with words of great<br>sweetness."
