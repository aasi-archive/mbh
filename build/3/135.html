                            "Lomasa said, 'Here, O king, is visible the river Samanga, whose former<br>name was Madhuvila, and yonder is the spot named Kardamila, the bathing<br>place of Bharata. The lord of Sachi, when fallen into misery in<br>consequence of having slain Vritra, became freed from his sin, by<br>performing his ablutions in this Samanga. Here, O bull among men, is the<br>spot where the Mainaka mountain hath sunk into the interior of the earth;<br>and it is hence called Vinasana. For obtaining sons, here Aditi in days<br>of yore had cooked that celebrated food, (presided over by the Supreme<br>Being). O ye bulls among men, ascended this lofty mountain and put an end<br>to your inglorious misery unworthy to be uttered. Here, O king, before<br>thee is the Kanakhala range, the favourite resort of sages. 'And yonder<br>is the mighty river Ganga. Here, in ancient times, the holy sage<br>Sanatkumara attained ascetic success. O scion of the Ajamidha race, by<br>performing thy ablutions here in this river, thou wilt be freed from all<br>thy sins. O son of Kunti, do thou together with thy ministers, touch (the<br>waters) of this lake called Punya, and this mountain Bhrigutunga and also<br>(the water of) these two rivers, called Tushniganga. Here, O Kunti's son,<br>appeareth the hermitage of the sage Sthulasiras. Resign here thy anger<br>and sense of self-importance. There, O son of Pandu, is seen the<br>beautiful hermitage of Raivya, where perished Bharadwaja's son, Yavakari,<br>profound in Vedic lore.'"<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'How did the mighty sage, Yavakri, son of the ascetic<br>Bharadwaja, acquire profundity in the Vedas? And how also did he perish?<br>I am anxious to hear all this, just as it happened. I take delight in<br>listening to the narration of the deeds of god-like men.'"<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'Bharadwaja and Raivya were two friends. And they dwelt<br>here, ever taking the greatest pleasure in each other's company. Now,<br>Raivya had two sons, named Arvavasu and Paravasu. And, Bharadwaja, O<br>Bharata's son, had an only son, named Yavakri. Raivya and his two sons<br>were versed in the Vedas, while Bharadwaja practised asceticism. But, O<br>son of Bharata, from their boyhood, the friendship subsisting between<br>those two was unequalled. O sinless one, the highspirited Yavakri finding<br>that his father, who practised asceticism, was slighted by the Brahmanas,<br>while Raivya with his sons was greatly respected by them, was overwhelmed<br>with sorrow, and became sore aggrieved. Thereupon, O son of Pandu, he<br>entered upon severe austerities, for (obtaining) a knowledge of the<br>Vedas. And he exposed his body to a flaming fire. By thus practising the<br>most rigid austerities, he caused anxiety in the mind of Indra. Then<br>Indra, O Yudhishthira, went to him and addressed him saying, 'Wherefore,<br>O sage, hast thou become engaged in practising such rigid austerities?'<br>Yavakri said, 'O thou adored of celestial hosts, I am practising severe<br>penances, because I wish that such a knowledge of the Vedas as hath never<br>been acquired by any Brahmana whatever, may be manifest unto me. O<br>conqueror of Paka, these endeavours of mine have been for Vedic lore. O<br>Kausika, by the force of my asceticism. I purpose to obtain all sorts of<br>knowledge. O lord, a knowledge of the Vedas as learnt through teachers,<br>is acquired in a long time. Therefore, (with the view of attaining in<br>short time a proficiency in the Vedas), I have put forth these high<br>endeavours.' Indra said, 'O Brahmana sage, the way that thou hast adopted<br>is not the proper way. What for, O Brahamana, wilt thou destroy thyself?<br>Go and learn from the lips of a preceptor.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'O son of Bharata, having said this, Sakra went away, and<br>Yavakri of immeasurable energy, once more directed his attention to<br>asceticism. O king, we have heard that carrying on severe austerities he<br>again greatly agitated Indra. And the god Indra, slayer of Vala, again<br>came unto that great sage, who was engaged in austere penances; and<br>forbade him, saying, Thou art striving with the object that Vedic lore<br>may be manifest unto thee as well as unto thy father; but thy exertions<br>can never be successful, nor is this act of thine well-advised.' Yavakri<br>said, 'O lord of the celestials, if thou wilt not do for me what I want,<br>I shall, observing stricter vows, practise still severer penances. O lord<br>of celestials! know that if thou do not fulfil all my desires, I shall<br>then cut off my limbs and offer them as a sacrifice into a blazing fire.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'Knowing the determination of that high-souled sage, the<br>sagacious Indra reflected and hit upon some expedient to dissuade him.<br>Then Indra assumed the guise of an ascetic Brahmana, hundreds of years<br>old, and infirm, and suffering from consumption. And he fell to throwing<br>up a dam with sands, at that spot of the Bhagirathi to which Yavakri used<br>to descend for performing ablutions. Because Yavakri, chief of the<br>Brahmanas, paid no heed to Indra's words, the latter began to fill the<br>Ganga with sands. And without cessation, he threw handfuls of sand into<br>the Bhagirathi, and began to construct the dam attracting the notice of<br>the sage. And when that bull among the sages, Yavakri, saw Indra thus<br>earnestly engaged in constructing the dam, he broke into laughter, and<br>said the following words, 'What art thou engaged in, O Brahmana, and what<br>is thy object? Why dost thou, for nothing, make this mighty endeavour?'<br>Indra said, 'I am trying, O my son, to dam the Ganga so that there may be<br>a commodious passage. People experience considerable difficulty in<br>crossing and recrossing (the river) by boat.' Yavakri said, 'O thou of<br>ascetic wealth, thou canst not dam up this mighty current. O Brahmana,<br>desist from, what is impracticable, and take up something that is<br>practicable.' Indra said, 'O sage, I have imposed on myself this heavy<br>task, even as, for obtaining a knowledge of the Vedas, thou hast begun<br>these penances, which can never be fruitful.' Yavakri said, 'If, O chief<br>of the celestials, those efforts of mine be fruitless, even as those of<br>thy own, then, O lord of heavenly hosts, be thou pleased to do for me<br>what is practicable. Vouchsafe unto me boons whereby I may excel other<br>men.'<br><br>"Lomasa said 'Then Indra granted boons, as was prayed for by the mighty<br>ascetic, Indra said, 'As thou desirest, the Vedas will be manifest unto<br>thee, yea&#8212;even unto thy father. And all thy other desires will also be<br>fulfilled. Return home, O Yavakri.'<br><br>"Having thus obtained the object of his desire, Yavakri came unto his<br>father and said, The Vedas, O father, will be manifest unto thee as well<br>as unto myself and I have obtained boons whereby we shall excel all men.'<br>Thereat Bharadwaja said, 'O my son, as thou hast obtained the objects of<br>thy desire, thou wilt be proud. And when thou art puffed up with pride<br>and hast also become uncharitable, destruction will soon overtake thee. O<br>my son, there is a current anecdote narrated by the gods. In ancient<br>times, O son, there lived a sage named Valadhi, possessed of great<br>energy. And in grief for the death of a child, he practised the severest<br>penances to have a child that should be immortal. And he obtained a son<br>even as he desired. But the gods, though very favourably disposed<br>(towards him), did not yet make his son immortal like unto the gods. They<br>said, 'On condition can a mortal being be made immortal. Thy son's life,<br>however, shall depend on some instrumental cause.' Thereupon, Valadhi<br>said, 'O chiefs of the celestials, these mountains have been existing<br>eternally, and indestructible, let them be the instrumental cause of my<br>son's life. Afterwards a son was born to the sage, named Medhavi. And he<br>was of a very irritable temper. And hearing of (the incident of his<br>birth), he grew haughty, and began to insult the sages. And he ranged<br>over the earth, doing mischief to the munis. And one day, meeting with<br>the learned sage Dhannushaksha endued with energy. Medhavi maltreated<br>him. Thereupon, the former cursed him, saying, 'Be thou reduced to<br>ashes.' Medhavi, however, was not reduced to ashes. Then Dhannushaksha<br>caused the mountain which was the instrumental cause of Medhavi's life,<br>to be shattered by buffaloes. And the boy perished, with the destruction<br>of the instrumental cause of his life. And embracing his dead son,<br>Medhavi's father began to bewail his fate. Now hear from me, O my son,<br>what was chanted by the sages conversant with the Vedas, when they found<br>the sage mourning. A mortal on no condition whatever can overcome what<br>hath been ordained by Fate, Lo! Dhannushaksha succeeded in shattering<br>even the mountain by buffaloes. Thus young ascetics, puffed up with pride<br>for having obtained boons, perish in a short time. Be thou not one of<br>them. This Raivya, O my son, is possessed of great energy, and his two<br>sons are like him. Therefore, be thou vigilant&#8212;so as never to approach<br>him. O my son, Raivya is a great ascetic of an irritable temper. When<br>angry, he can do thee harm. Yavakri said, 'I shall do as thou biddest me.<br>Of father, do thou not by any means entertain anxiety for that. Raivya<br>deserveth my regard even as thou, my father.' Having replied unto his<br>father in these sweet words, Yavakri, fearing nothing and nobody, began<br>to delight in wantonly offending other munis."
