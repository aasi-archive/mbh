                            Vaisampayana said, "O Bharata, Kotikakhya related to those princes who<br>had been waiting, all that had passed between him and Krishna. And<br>hearing Kotikakhya's words, Jayadratha said to that scion of the race of<br>Sivi, 'Having listened only to her speech, my heart has been lovingly<br>inclined towards that ornament of womankind. Why therefore, hast thou<br>returned (thus unsuccessful)? I tell thee truly, O thou of mighty arms,<br>that having once seen this lady, other women now seem to me like so many<br>monkeys. I having looked at her, she has captivated my heart. Do tell me,<br>O Saivya, if that excellent lady is of the human kind.' Kotika replied,<br>'This lady is the famous princess Krishna, the daughter of Drupada, and<br>the celebrated wife of the five sons of Pandu. She is the much esteemed<br>and beloved and chaste wife of the sons of Pritha. Taking her with thee,<br>do thou proceed towards Sauvira!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, the evil-minded Jayadratha, the<br>king of Sindhu, Sauvira and other countries, said, 'I must see Draupadi.'<br>And with six other men he entered that solitary hermitage, like a wolf<br>entering the den of a lion. And he said unto Krishna, 'Hail to thee,<br>excellent lady! Are thy husbands well and those, besides, whose<br>prosperity thou always wishest.' Draupadi replied, 'Kunti's son king<br>Yudhishthira of the race of Kuru, his brothers, myself, and all those of<br>whom thou hast enquired of, are well. Is everything right with thy<br>kingdom, thy government, exchequer, and thy army? Art thou, as sole<br>ruler, governing with justice the rich countries of Saivya, Sivi, Sindhu<br>and others that thou hast brought under thy sway? Do thou, O prince,<br>accept this water for washing thy feet. Do thou also take this seat. I<br>offer thee fifty animals for thy train's breakfast. Besides these,<br>Yudhishthira himself, the son of Kunti, will give thee porcine deer and<br>Nanku deer, and does, and antelopes, and Sarabhas, and rabbits, and Ruru<br>deer, and bears, and Samvara deer and gayals and many other animals,<br>besides wild boars and buffaloes and other animals of the quadruped<br>tribe.' Hearing this Jayadratha replied, saying, 'All is well with me. By<br>offering to provide our breakfast, thou hast in a manner actually done<br>it. Come now and ride my chariot and be completely happy. For it becomes<br>not thee to have any regard for the miserable sons of Pritha who are<br>living in the woods, whose energies have been paralysed, whose kingdom<br>hath been snatched and whose fortunes are at the lowest ebb. A woman of<br>sense like thee doth not attach herself to a husband that is poor. She<br>should follow her lord when he is in prosperity but abandon him when in<br>adversity. The sons of Pandu have for ever fallen away from their high<br>state, and have lost their kingdom for all time to come. Thou hast no<br>need, therefore, to partake of their misery from any regard for them.<br>Therefore, O thou of beautiful hips, forsaking the sons of Pandu, be<br>happy by becoming my wife, and share thou with me the kingdoms of Sindhu<br>and Sauvira.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Hearing these frightful words of the king of<br>Sindhu, Krishna retired from that place, her face furrowed into a frown<br>owing to the contraction of her eye-brows. But disregarding his words<br>from supreme contempt, the slender-waisted Krishna reproving said unto<br>the king of Sindhu, 'Speak not thus again! Art thou not ashamed? Be on<br>thy guard!' And that lady of irreproachable character anxiously expecting<br>the return of her husband, began, with long speeches, to beguile him<br>completely."
