                            "Vaisampayana said, 'When that night passed away and day broke in, those<br>Brahmamas who supported themselves by mendicancy, stood before the<br>Pandavas of exalted deeds, who were about to enter the forest. Then king<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, addressed them, saying, "Robbed of our<br>prosperity and kingdom, robbed of everything, we are about to enter the<br>deep woods in sorrow, depending for our food on fruits and roots, and the<br>produce of the chase. The forest too is full of dangers, and abounds with<br>reptiles and beasts of prey. It appeareth to me that ye will certainly<br>have to suffer much privation and misery there. The sufferings of the<br>Brahmanas might overpower even the gods. That they would overwhelm me is<br>too certain. Therefore, O Brahmana, go ye back whithersoever ye list!'<br><br>"The Brahmanas replied, 'O king, our path is even that on which ye are<br>for setting out! It behoveth thee not, therefore, to forsake us who are<br>thy devoted admirers practising the true religion! The very gods have<br>compassion upon their worshippers,&#8212;specially upon Brahmanas of regulated<br>lives!'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'We regenerate ones, I too am devoted to the<br>Brahmanas! But this destitution that hath overtaken me overwhelmed me<br>with confusion! These my brothers that are to procure fruits and roots<br>and the deer (of the forest) are stupefied with grief arising from their<br>afflictions and on account of the distress of Draupadi and the loss of<br>our kingdom! Alas, as they are distressed, I cannot employ them in<br>painful tasks!'<br><br>"The Brahmanas said, 'Let no anxiety, O king, in respect of our<br>maintenance, find a place in thy heart! Ourselves providing our own food,<br>we shall follow thee, and by meditation and saying our prayers we shall<br>compass thy welfare while by pleasant converse we shall entertain thee<br>and be cheered ourselves.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Without doubt, it must be as ye say, for I am ever<br>pleased with the company of the regenerate ones! But my fallen condition<br>maketh me behold in myself an object of reproach! How shall I behold you<br>all, that do not deserve to bear trouble, out of love for me painfully<br>subsisting upon food procured by your own toil? Oh, fie upon the wicked<br>sons of Dhritarashtra!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued. 'Saying this, the weeping king sat himself down<br>upon the ground. Then a learned Brahmana, Saunaka by name versed in<br>self-knowledge and skilled in the Sankhya system of yoga, addressed the<br>king, saying, 'Causes of grief by thousands, and causes of fear by<br>hundreds, day after day, overwhelm the ignorant but not the wise. Surely,<br>sensible men like thee never suffer themselves to be deluded by acts that<br>are opposed to true knowledge, fraught with every kind of evil, and<br>destructive of salvation. O king, in thee dwelleth that understanding<br>furnished with the eight attributes which is said to be capable of<br>providing against all evils and which resulteth from a study of the Sruti<br>(Vedas) and scriptures! And men like unto thee are never stupefied, on<br>the accession of poverty or an affliction overtaking their friends,<br>through bodily or mental uneasiness! Listen, I shall tell the slokas<br>which were chanted of old by the illustrious Janaka touching the subject<br>of controlling the self! This world is afflicted with both bodily and<br>mental suffering. Listen now to the means of allaying it as I indicate<br>them both briefly and in detail. Disease, contact with painful things,<br>toil and want of objects desired.&#8212;these are the four causes that induce<br>bodily suffering. And as regards disease, it may be allayed by the<br>application of medicine, while mental ailments are cured by seeking to<br>forget them yoga-meditation. For this reason, sensible physicians first<br>seek to allay the mental sufferings of their patients by agreeable<br>converse and the offer of desirable objects And as a hot iron bar thrust<br>into a jar maketh the water therein hot, even so doth mental grief bring<br>on bodily agony. And as water quencheth fire, so doth true knowledge<br>allay mental disquietude. And the mind attaining ease, the body findeth<br>ease also. It seemeth that affection is the root of all mental sorrow. It<br>is affection that maketh every creature miserable and bringeth on every<br>kind of woe. Verily affection is the root of all misery and of all fear,<br>of joy and grief of every kind of pain. From affection spring all<br>purposes, and it is from affection that spring the love of worldly goods!<br>Both of these (latter) are sources of evil, though the first (our<br>purposes) is worse than the second. And as (a small portion of) fire<br>thrust into the hollow of a tree consumeth the tree itself to its roots,<br>even so affection, ever so little, destroyeth both virtue and profit. He<br>cannot be regarded to have renounced the world who hath merely withdrawn<br>from worldly possessions. He, however, who though in actual contact with<br>the world regardeth its faults, may be said to have truly renounced the<br>world. Freed from every evil passion, soul dependent on nothing with such<br>a one hath truly renounced the world. Therefore, should no one seek to<br>place his affections on either friends or the wealth he hath earned. And<br>so should affection for one's own person be extinguished by knowledge.<br>Like the lotus-leaf that is never drenched by water, the souls of men<br>capable of distinguishing between the ephemeral and the everlasting, of<br>men devoted to the pursuit of the eternal, conversant with the scriptures<br>and purified by knowledge, can never be moved by affection. The man that<br>is influenced by affection is tortured by desire; and from the desire<br>that springeth up in his heart his thirst for worldly possessions<br>increaseth. Verily, this thirst is sinful and is regarded as the source<br>of all anxieties. It is this terrible thirst, fraught with sin that<br>leaneth unto unrighteous acts. Those find happiness that can renounce<br>this thirst, which can never be renounced by the wicked, which decayeth<br>not with the decay of the body, and which is truly a fatal disease! It<br>hath neither beginning nor end. Dwelling within the heart, it destroyeth<br>creatures, like a fire of incorporeal origin. And as a faggot of wood is<br>consumed by the fire that is fed by itself, even so doth a person of<br>impure soul find destruction from the covetousness born of his heart. And<br>as creatures endued with life have ever a dread of death, so men of<br>wealth are in constant apprehension of the king and the thief, of water<br>and fire and even of their relatives. And as a morsel of meat, if in air,<br>may be devoured by birds; if on ground by beasts of prey; and if in water<br>by the fishes; even so is the man of wealth exposed to dangers wherever<br>he may be. To many the wealth they own is their bane, and he that<br>beholding happiness in wealth becometh wedded to it, knoweth not true<br>happiness. And hence accession of wealth is viewed as that which<br>increaseth covetousness and folly. Wealth alone is the root of<br>niggardliness and boastfulness, pride and fear and anxiety! These are the<br>miseries of men that the wise see in riches! Men undergo infinite<br>miseries in the acquisition and retention of wealth. Its expenditure also<br>is fraught with grief. Nay, sometimes, life itself is lost for the sake<br>of wealth! The abandonment of wealth produces misery, and even they that<br>are cherished by one's wealth become enemies for the sake of that wealth!<br>When, therefore, the possession of wealth is fraught with such misery,<br>one should not mind its loss. It is the ignorant alone who are<br>discontented. The wise, however, are always content. The thirst of wealth<br>can never be assuaged. Contentment is the highest happiness; therefore,<br>it is, that the wise regard contentment as the highest object of pursuit.<br>The wise knowing the instability of youth and beauty, of life and<br>treasure-hoards, of prosperity and the company of the loved ones, never<br>covet them. Therefore, one should refrain from the acquisition of wealth,<br>bearing the pain incident to it. None that is rich free from trouble, and<br>it is for this that the virtuous applaud them that are free from the<br>desire of wealth. And as regards those that pursue wealth for purposes of<br>virtue, it is better for them to refrain altogether from such pursuit,<br>for, surely, it is better not to touch mire at all than to wash it off<br>after having been besmeared with it. And, O Yudhishthira, it behoveth<br>thee not to covet anything! And if thou wouldst have virtue, emancipate<br>thyself from desire of worldly possessions!'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O Brahmana, this my desire of wealth is not for<br>enjoying it when obtained. It is only for the support of the Brahmanas<br>that I desire it and not because I am actuated by avarice! For what<br>purpose, O Brahmana, doth one like us lead a domestic life, if he cannot<br>cherish and support those that follow him? All creatures are seen to<br>divide the food (they procure) amongst those that depend on them.[1] So<br>should a person leading a domestic life give a share of his food to Yatis<br>and Brahmacharins that have renounced cooking for themselves. The houses<br>of the good men can never be in want of grass (for seat), space (for<br>rest), water (to wash and assuage thirst), and fourthly, sweet words. To<br>the weary a bed,&#8212;to one fatigued with standing, a seat,&#8212;to the thirsty,<br>water,&#8212;and to the hungry, food should ever be given. To a guest are due<br>pleasant looks and a cheerful heart and sweet words. The host, rising up,<br>should advance towards the guest, offer him a seat, and duly worship him.<br>Even this is eternal morality. They that perform not the Agnihotra[2] not<br>wait upon bulls, nor cherish their kinsmen and guests and friends and<br>sons and wives and servants, are consumed with sin for such neglect. None<br>should cook his food for himself alone and none should slay an animal<br>without dedicating it to the gods, the pitris, and guests. Nor should one<br>eat of that food which hath not been duly dedicated to the gods and<br>pitris. By scattering food on the earth, morning and evening, for (the<br>behoof of) dogs and Chandalas and birds, should a person perform the<br>Viswedeva sacrifice.[3] He that eateth the Vighasa, is regarded as eating<br>ambrosia. What remaineth in a sacrifice after dedication to the gods and<br>the pitris is regarded as ambrosia; and what remaineth after feeding the<br>guest is called Vighasa and is equivalent to ambrosia itself. Feeding a<br>guest is equivalent to a sacrifice, and the pleasant looks the host<br>casteth upon the guest, the attention he devoteth to him, the sweet words<br>in which he addresseth him, the respect he payeth by following him, and<br>the food and drink with which he treateth him, are the five Dakshinas[4]<br>in that sacrifice. He who giveth without stint food to a fatigued<br>wayfarer never seen before, obtaineth merit that is great, and he who<br>leading a domestic life, followeth such practices, acquireth religious<br>merit that is said to be very great. O Brahmana, what is thy opinion on<br>this?"<br><br>"Saunaka said, 'Alas, this world is full of contradictions! That which<br>shameth the good, gratifieth the wicked! Alas, moved by ignorance and<br>passion and slaves of their own senses, even fools perform many acts of<br>(apparent merit) to gratify in after-life their appetites! With eyes open<br>are these men led astray by their seducing senses, even as a charioteer,<br>who hath lost his senses, by restive and wicked steeds! When any of the<br>six senses findeth its particular object, the desire springeth up in the<br>heart to enjoy that particular object. And thus when one's heart<br>proceedeth to enjoy the objects of any particular sense a wish is<br>entertained which in its turn giveth birth to a resolve. And finally,<br>like unto an insect falling into a flame from love of light, the man<br>falleth into the fire of temptation, pierced by the shafts of the object<br>of enjoyment discharged by the desire constituting the seed of the<br>resolve! And thenceforth blinded by sensual pleasure which he seeketh<br>without stint, and steeped in dark ignorance and folly which he mistaketh<br>for a state of happiness, he knoweth not himself! And like unto a wheel<br>that is incessantly rolling, every creature, from ignorance and deed and<br>desire, falleth into various states in this world, wandering from one<br>birth to another, and rangeth the entire circle of existences from a<br>Brahma to the point of a blade of grass, now in water, now on land, and<br>now against in the air!<br><br>'This then is the career of those that are without knowledge. Listen now<br>to the course of the wise they that are intent on profitable virtue, and<br>are desirous of emancipation! The Vedas enjoin act but renounce (interest<br>in) action. Therefore, shouldst thou act, renouncing Abhimana,[5]<br>performance of sacrifices, study (of the Vedas), gifts, penance, truth<br>(in both speech and act), forgiveness, subduing the senses, and<br>renunciation of desire,&#8212;these have been declared to be the eight<br>(cardinal) duties constituting the true path. Of these, the four first<br>pave the way to the world of the pitris. And these should be practised<br>without Abhimana. The four last are always observed by the pious, to<br>attain the heaven of the gods. And the pure in spirit should ever follow<br>these eight paths. Those who wish to subdue the world for purpose of<br>salvation, should ever act fully renouncing motives, effectually subduing<br>their senses, rigidly observing particular vows, devotedly serving their<br>preceptors, austerely regulating their fare, diligently studying the<br>Vedas, renouncing action as mean and restraining their hearts. By<br>renouncing desire and aversion the gods have attained prosperity. It is<br>by virtue of their wealth of yoga[6] that the Rudras, and the Sadhyas,<br>and the Adityas and the Vasus, and the twin Aswins, rule the creatures.<br>Therefore, O son of Kunti, like unto them, do thou, O Bharata, entirely<br>refraining from action with motive, strive to attain success in yoga and<br>by ascetic austerities. Thou hast already achieved such success so far as<br>thy debts to thy ancestors, both male and female concerned, and that<br>success also which is derived from action (sacrifices). Do thou, for<br>serving the regenerate ones endeavour to attain success in penances.<br>Those that are crowned with ascetic success, can, by virtue of that<br>success, do whatever they list; do thou, therefore, practising asceticism<br>realise all thy wishes."
