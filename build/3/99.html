                            "Lomasa said, 'When Ilwala learnt that those kings along with the great<br>Rishi had arrived on the confines of his domain, he went out with his<br>ministers and worshipped them duly. And that prince of Asuras received<br>them hospitably, entertaining them, O son of the Kuru race, with well<br>dressed meat supplied by his brother Vatapi (transformed into a ram).<br>Then all those royal sages, beholding the mighty Asura Vatapi, who had<br>been transformed into a ram thus cooked for them, became sad and<br>cheerless and were nearly deprived of themselves. But that best of<br>Rishis&#8212;Agastya&#8212;addressing those royal sages, said, 'Yield ye not to<br>grief, I will eat up the great Asura.' And the mighty Rishi then sat<br>himself down on an excellent seat, and the prince of Asuras, Ilwala,<br>began to distribute the food smilingly. And Agastya ate up the whole of<br>the meat supplied by Vatapi (transformed into a ram). And after the<br>dinner was over, Ilwala began to summon his brother. But thereupon a<br>quantity of air alone came out of the illustrious Rishi's stomach, with a<br>sound that was as loud, O child, as the roar of the clouds. And Ilwala<br>repeatedly said, 'Come out, O Vatapi!' Then that best of<br>Munis&#8212;Agastya&#8212;bursting out in laughter, said, 'How can he come out? I<br>have already digested that great Asura.' And beholding his brother<br>already digested, Ilwala became sad and cheerless and joining his hands,<br>along with his ministers, addressing the Rishi (and his companions),<br>said, 'What for have ye come hither, and what can I do for you?' And<br>Agastya smilingly answered Ilwala, saying, 'We know thee, O Asura, to be<br>possessed of great power and also enormous wealth. These kings are not<br>very wealthy while my need also of wealth is great. Give us what thou<br>canst, without injuring others.' Thus addressed Ilwala saluted the Rishi<br>and said, 'If thou say what it is that I mean to give, then will I give<br>you wealth.' Hearing this Agastya said, 'O great Asura, thou hast even<br>purposed to give unto each of these kings ten thousand kine and as many<br>gold coins. And unto me thou hast purposed to give twice as much, as also<br>a car of gold and a couple of horses fleet as thought. If thou enquirest<br>now, thou wilt soon learn that your car is made of gold.' Thereupon, O<br>son of Kunti, Ilwala made enquiries and learnt that the car he had<br>intended to give away was really a golden one. And the Daitya then with a<br>sad heart, gave away much wealth and that car, unto which were yoked two<br>steeds called Virava and Surava. And those steeds, O Bharata, took those<br>kings and Agastya and all that wealth to the asylum of Agastya within the<br>twinkling of an eye. And those royal sages then obtaining Agastya's<br>permission, went away to their respective cities. And Agastya also (with<br>that wealth) did all that his wife Lopamudra had desired. And Lopamudra<br>then said, 'O illustrious one, thou hast now accomplished all my wishes.<br>Beget thou a child on me that shall be possessed of great energy.' And<br>Agastya replied unto her, saying, 'O blessed and beauteous one, I have<br>been much gratified with thy conduct. Listen thou unto me as regards the<br>proposal I make in respect of thy offspring. Wouldst thou have a thousand<br>sons, or a century of sons each equal to ten, or ten sons equal each to<br>an hundred, or only one son who may vanquish a thousand?' Lopamudra<br>answered, 'Let me have one son equal unto a thousand, O thou endued with<br>wealth of asceticism! One good and learned son is preferable to many evil<br>ones.'"<br><br>"Lomasa continued, 'Saying, 'So be it,' that pious Muni thereupon knew<br>his devout wife of equal behaviour. And after she had conceived, he<br>retired into the forest. And after the Muni had gone away, the foetus<br>began to grow for seven years. And after the seventh year had expired,<br>there came out of the womb, the highly learned Dridhasyu, blazing, O<br>Bharata, in his own splendour. And the great Brahmana and illustrious<br>ascetic, endued with mighty energy, took his birth as the Rishi's son,<br>coming out of the womb, as if repeating the Vedas with the Upanishads and<br>the Angas. Endued with great energy while yet a child, he used to carry<br>loads of sacrificial fuel into the asylum of his father, and was thence<br>called Idhmavaha (carrier of sacrificial wood). And the Muni, beholding<br>his son possessed of such virtues, became highly glad.<br><br>"And it was thus, O Bharata, that Agastya begat an excellent son in<br>consequence of which his ancestors, O king, obtained the regions they<br>desired. And it is from that time that this spot hath become known on the<br>earth as the asylum of Agastya. Indeed, O king, this is the asylum graced<br>with numerous beauties, of that Agastya who had slain Vatapi of<br>Prahrada's race. The sacred Bhagirathi, adored by gods and Gandharvas<br>gently runneth by, like a breeze-shaken pennon in the welkin. Yonder also<br>she floweth over craggy crests descending lower and lower, and looketh<br>like an affrighted she-snake lying along the hilly slopes. Issuing out of<br>the matted locks of Mahadeva, she passeth along, flooding the southern<br>country and benefiting it like a mother, and ultimately mingleth with the<br>ocean as if she were his favourite bride. Bathe ye as ye like in this<br>sacred river, ye son of Pandu! And behold there, O Yudhisthira, the<br>tirtha of Bhrigu that is celebrated over the three worlds and adored, O<br>king, by great Rishis. Bathing here, Rama (of Bhrigu's race) regained his<br>might, which had been taken away from him (by Dasaratha's son). Bathing<br>here, O son of Pandu, with thy brothers and Krishna, thou wilt certainly<br>regain that energy of thine that hath been taken away by Duryodhana, even<br>as Rama regained his that had been taken away by Dasaratha's son in<br>hostile encounter."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "At these words of Lomasa, Yudhishthira bathed<br>there with his brothers and Krishna, and offered oblations of water, O<br>Bharata, to the gods and the Pitris. And, O bull among men, after<br>Yudhishthira had bathed in that tirtha, his body blazed forth in brighter<br>effulgence, and he became invisible in respect of all foes. The son of<br>Pandu then, O king, asked Lomasa, saying, 'O illustrious one, why had<br>Rama's energy and might been taken away? And how also did he regain it? O<br>exalted one, I ask thee, tell me everything.'"<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'Listen, O king, to the history of Rama (the son of<br>Dasaratha) and Rama of Bhrigu's line gifted with intelligence. For the<br>destruction of Ravana, O king, Vishnu, in his own body, took his birth as<br>the son of illustrious Dasaratha. We saw in Ayodhya that son of Dasaratha<br>after he had been born. It was then that Rama of Bhrigu's line, the son<br>of Richika by Renuka, hearing of Rama the son of Dasaratha&#8212;of spotless<br>deeds&#8212;went to Ayodhya, impelled by curiosity, and taking with him that<br>celestial bow so fatal to the Kshatriyas, for ascertaining the prowess of<br>Dasaratha's son. And Dasaratha, hearing that Rama of Bhrigu's race had<br>arrived on the confines of his domains, set his own son Rama to receive<br>the hero with respect. And beholding Dasaratha's son approach and stand<br>before him with ready weapons, Rama of Bhrigu's line smilingly addressed<br>him, O son of Kunti, saying, 'O king, O exalted one, string, if thou<br>canst, with all thy mighty, this bow which in my hands was made the<br>instrument of destroying the Kshatriya race.' Thus addressed, Dasaratha's<br>son answered, 'O illustrious one, it behoveth thee not to insult me thus.<br>Nor am I, amongst the regenerate classes, deficient in the virtues of the<br>Kshatriya order. The descendants of Ikshwaku in special never boast of<br>the prowess of their arms.' Then unto Dasaratha's son who said so, Rama<br>of Bhrigu's line replied, 'A truce to all crafty speech, O king! Take<br>this bow.' At this, Rama the son of Dasaratha, took in anger from the<br>hands of Rama of Bhrigu's line that celestial bow that had dealt death to<br>the foremost of Kshatriyas. And, O Bharata, the mighty hero smilingly<br>strung that bow without the least exertion, and with its twang loud as<br>the thunder-rattle, affrighted all creatures. And Rama, the son of<br>Dasaratha, then, addressing Rama of Bhrigu's said, 'Here, I have strung<br>this bow. What else, O Brahmana, shall I do for thee?' Then Rama, the son<br>of Jamadagni, gave unto the illustrious son of Dasaratha a celestial<br>arrow and said, 'Placing this on the bow-string, draw to thy ear, O<br>hero!' "Lomasa continued, 'Hearing this, Dasaratha's son blazed up in<br>wrath and said, 'I have heard what thou hast said, and even pardoned<br>thee. O son of Bhrigu's race, thou art full of vanity. Through the<br>Grandsire's grace thou hast obtained energy that is superior to that of<br>the Kshatriyas. And it is for this that thou insultest me. Behold me now<br>in my native form: I give thee sight.' Then Rama of Bhrigu's race beheld<br>in the body of Dasaratha's son the Adityas with the Vasus, the Rudras,<br>the Sadhyas with the Marutas, the Pitris, Hutasana, the stellar<br>constellations and the planets, the Gandharvas, the Rakshasas, the<br>Yakshas, the Rivers, the tirthas, those eternal Rishis identified with<br>Brahma and called the Valkhilyas, the celestial Rishis, the Seas and<br>Mountains, the Vedas with the Upanishads and Vashats and the sacrifices,<br>the Samans in their living form, the Science of weapons, O Bharata, and<br>the Clouds with rain and lightning, O Yudhishthira! And the illustrious<br>Vishnu then shot that shaft. And at this the earth was filled with sounds<br>of thunder, and burning meteors. O Bharata, began to flash through the<br>welkin. And showers of dust and rain fell upon the surface of the earth.<br>And whirlwinds and frightful sounds convulsed everything, and the earth<br>herself began to quake. And shot by the hand of Rama, that shalt,<br>confounding by its energy the other Rama, came back blazing into Rama's<br>hands. And Bhargava, who had thus been deprived of his senses, regaining<br>consciousness and life, bowed unto Rama&#8212;that manifestation of Vishnu's<br>power. And commanded by Vishnu, he proceeded to the mountains of<br>Mahendra. And thenceforth that great ascetic began to dwell there, in<br>terror and shame. And after the expiration of a year, the Pitris,<br>beholding Rama dwelling there deprived of energy, his pride quelled, and<br>himself sunk in affliction, said unto him, 'O son, having approached<br>Vishnu, thy behaviour towards him was not proper. He deserveth for aye<br>worship and respect in the three worlds. Go, O son, to that sacred river<br>which goeth by name of Vadhusara! Bathing in all the tirthas of that<br>stream, thou wilt regain thy energy! There in that river is the tirthas<br>called Diptoda where thy grandsire Bhrigu, O Rama, in the celestial age<br>had practised ascetic penances of great merit.' Thus addressed by them,<br>Rama, O son of Kunti, did what the Pitris bade him, and obtained back at<br>this tirtha, O son of Pandu, the energy he had lost. Even this O child,<br>was what befell Rama of spotless deeds in days in of yore, after he had,<br>O king, met Vishnu (in the form of Dasaratha's son)!'"
