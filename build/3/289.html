                            "Markandeya said, 'Having slain Ravana, that wretched king of the<br>Rakshasas and foe of the celestials, Rama with his friends and Sumitra's<br>son rejoiced exceedingly. And after the Ten-necked (Rakshasa) hath been<br>slain, the celestials with the Rishis at their head, worshipped Rama of<br>mighty arms, blessing and uttering the word Jaya repeatedly. And all the<br>celestials and the Gandharvas and the denizens of the celestial regions<br>gratified Rama of eyes like lotus leaves, with hymns and flowery showers.<br>And having duly worshipped Rama, they all went away to those regions<br>whence they had come. And, O thou of unfading glory, the firmament at<br>that time looked as if a great festival was being celebrated.<br><br>"And having slain the Ten-necked Rakshasa, the lord Rama of worldwide<br>fame, that conqueror of hostile cities, bestowed Lanka on Vibhishana.<br>Then that old and wise counsellor (of Ravana) known by the name of<br>Avindhya, with Sita walking before him but behind Vibhishana who was at<br>the front, came out of the city. And with great humility Avindhya said<br>unto the illustrious descendant of Kakutstha, 'O illustrious one, accept<br>thou this goddess, Janaka's daughter of excellent conduct!' Hearing these<br>words, the descendant of Ikshwaku's race alighted from his excellent<br>chariot and beheld Sita bathed in tears. And beholding that beautiful<br>lady seated within her vehicle, afflicted with grief, besmeared with<br>filth, with matted locks on head, and attired in dirty robes, Rama,<br>afraid of the loss of his honour, said unto her, 'Daughter of Videha, go<br>withersover thou likest! Thou art now free! What should have been done by<br>me, hath been done! O blessed lady, owning me for thy husband, it is not<br>meet that thou shouldst grow old in the abode of the Rakshasa! It is for<br>this I have slain that wanderer of the night! But how can one like us,<br>acquainted with every truth of morality embrace even for a moment a woman<br>that had fallen into other's hands? O princess of Mithila whether thou<br>art chaste or unchaste, I dare not enjoy thee, now that thou art like<br>sacrificial butter lapped by a dog!' Hearing these cruel words, that<br>adorable girl suddenly fell down in great affliction of heart, like a<br>plantain tree severed from its roots. And the colour that was suffusing<br>her face in consequence of the joy she had felt, quickly disappeared,<br>like watery particles on a mirror blown thereon by the breath of the<br>mouth. And hearing these words of Rama, all the monkeys also with<br>Lakshmana became still as dead. Then the divine and pure-souled Brahma of<br>four faces, that Creator of the Universe himself sprung from a lotus,<br>showed himself on his car to Raghu's son. And Sakra and Agni and Vayu,<br>and Yama and Varuna and the illustrious Lord of the Yakshas, and the holy<br>Rishis, and king Dasaratha also in a celestial and effulgent form and on<br>car drawn by swans, showed themselves. And then the firmament crowded<br>with celestials and Gandharvas became as beautiful as the autumnal welkin<br>spangled with stars. And rising up from the ground, the blessed and<br>famous princess of Videha, in the midst of those present spoke unto Rama<br>of wide chest, these words, 'O prince, I impute no fault to thee, for<br>thou art well acquainted with the behaviour that one should adopt towards<br>both men and women. But hear thou these words of mine! The ever-moving<br>Air is always present within every creature. If I have sinned, let him<br>forsake my vital forces! If I have sinned, Oh, then let Fire, and Water,<br>and Space, and Earth, like Air (whom I have already invoked), also<br>forsake my vital forces! And as, O hero, I have never, even in my dreams,<br>cherished the image of any other person, so be thou my lord as appointed<br>by the gods.' After Sita had spoken, a sacred voice, resounding through<br>the whole of that region, was heard in the skies, gladdening the hearts<br>of the high-souled monkeys. And the Wind-god was heard to say, O son of<br>Raghu, what Sita hath said is true! I am the god of Wind. The princess of<br>Mithila is sinless! Therefore, O king, be united with thy wife!' And the<br>god of Fire said, 'O son of Raghu, I dwell within the bodies of all<br>creatures! O descendant of Kakutstha, the princess of Mithila is not<br>guilty of even the minutest fault!' And Varuna then said, 'O son of<br>Raghu, the humours in every creature's body derive their existence from<br>me! I tell thee, let the princess of Mithila be accepted by thee!' And<br>Brahma himself then said, 'O descendant of Kakutstha, O son, in thee that<br>art honest and pure and conversant with the duties of royal sages, this<br>conduct is not strange. Listen, however, to these words of mine! Thou<br>hast, O hero, slain this enemy of the gods, the Gandharvas, the Nagas,<br>the Yakshas, the Danavas, and the great Rishis! It was through my grace<br>that he had hitherto been unslayable of all creatures. And indeed, it was<br>for some reason that I had tolerated him for some time! The wretch,<br>however, abducted Sita for his own destruction. And as regards Sita, I<br>protected her through Nalakuvera's curse. For that person had cursed<br>Ravana of old, saying, that if he ever approached an unwilling woman, his<br>head should certainly be split into a hundred fragments. Let no<br>suspicion, therefore, be thine! O thou of great glory, accept thy wife!<br>Thou hast indeed, achieved a mighty feat for the benefit of the gods, O<br>thou that art of divine effulgence!' And last of all Dasaratha said, 'I<br>have been gratified with thee, O child! Blessed be thou, I am thy father<br>Dasaratha! I command thee to take back thy wife, and rule thy kingdom, O<br>thou foremost of men!' Rama then replied, 'If thou art my father, I<br>salute thee with reverence, O king of kings! I shall indeed, return, at<br>thy command, to the delightful city of Ayodhya!'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Thus addressed, his father, O bull of the Bharata<br>race, gladly answered Rama, the corners of whose eyes were of a reddish<br>hue, saying, 'Return to Ayodhya and rule thou that kingdom! O thou of<br>great glory, thy fourteen years (of exile) have been completed.' Thus<br>addressed by Dasaratha, Rama bowed to the gods, and saluted by his<br>friends he was united with his wife, like the Lord of the celestials with<br>the daughter of Puloman. And that chastiser of foes then gave a boon to<br>Avindhya. And he also bestowed both riches and honours on the Rakshasa<br>woman named Trijata. And when Brahma with all the celestials having India<br>at their head, said unto Rama, 'O thou that ownest Kausalya for thy<br>mother, what boons after thy heart shall we grant thee?' Rama, thereupon,<br>prayed them to grant him firm adherence to virtues and invincibility in<br>respect of all foes. And he also asked for the restoration to life of all<br>those monkeys that had been slain by the Rakshasas, and after Brahma had<br>said&#8212;So be it, those monkeys, O king, restored to life, rose up from the<br>field of battle, and Sita too, of great good fortune, granted unto<br>Hanuman a boon, saying, 'Let thy life, O son, last as long as (the fame<br>of) Rama's achievements! And, O Hanuman of yellow eyes, let celestial<br>viands and drinks be ever available to thee through my grace!'<br><br>"Then the celestials with Indra at their head all disappeared in the very<br>sight of those warriors of spotless achievements. And beholding Rama<br>united with the daughter of Janaka, the charioteer of Sakra, highly<br>pleased, addressed him in the midst of friends, and said these words, 'O<br>thou of prowess that can never be baffled thou hast dispelled the sorrow<br>of the celestials, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the Asuras, the Nagas,<br>and human beings! As long, therefore, as the Earth will hold together, so<br>long will all creatures with the celestials, the Asuras, the Gandharvas,<br>the Yakshas, the Rakshasas, and the Pannagas, speak of thee.' And having<br>said these words unto Rama, Matali worshipped that son of Raghu, and<br>having obtained the leave of that foremost of wielders of weapons, he<br>went away, on that same chariot of solar effulgence. And Rama also, with<br>Sumatra's son and Vibhishana, and accompanied by all the monkeys with<br>Sugriva at their head, placing Sita in the van and having made<br>arrangements for the protection of Lanka, recrossed the ocean by the same<br>bridge. And he rode on that beautiful and sky-ranging chariot called the<br>Pushpaka that was capable of going everywhere at the will of the rider.<br>And that subduer of passions was surrounded by his principal counsellors<br>in order of precedence. And arriving at that part of the sea-shore where<br>he had formerly laid himself down, the virtuous king, with all the<br>monkeys, pitched his temporary abode. And the son of Raghu then, bringing<br>the monkeys before him in due time, worshipped them all, and gratifying<br>them with presents of jewels and gems, dismissed them one after another.<br>And after all the monkey-chiefs, and the apes with bovine tails, and the<br>bears, had gone away, Rama re-entered Kishkindhya with Sugriva. And<br>accompanied by both Vibhishana and Sugriva, Rama re-entered Kishkindhya<br>riding on the Pushpaka car and showing the princess of Videha the woods<br>along the way. And having arrived at Kishkindhya, Rama, that foremost of<br>all smiters, installed the successful Angada as prince-regent of the<br>kingdom. And accompanied by the same friends as also by Sumitra's son,<br>Rama proceeded towards his city along the same path by which he had come.<br>And having reached the city of Ayodhya, the king despatched Hanuman<br>thence as envoy to Bharata. And Hanuman, having ascertained Bharata's<br>intentions from external indications, gave him the good news (of Rama's<br>arrival). And after the son of Pavana had come back, Rama entered<br>Nandigrama. And having entered that town, Rama beheld Bharata besmeared<br>with filth and attired in rags and seated with his elder brother's<br>sandals placed before him. And being united, O bull of Bharata race, with<br>both Bharata and Shatrughna, the mighty son of Raghu, along with<br>Sumitra's son, began to rejoice exceedingly. And Bharata and Shatrughna<br>also, united with their eldest brother, and beholding Sita, both derived<br>great pleasure. And Bharata then, after having worshipped his returned<br>brother, made over to him with great pleasure, the kingdom that had been<br>in his hands as a sacred trust. And Vasishtha and Vamadeva then together<br>installed that hero in the sovereignty (of Ayodhya) at the eighth<br>Muhurta[105] of the day under the asterism called Sravana. And after his<br>installation was over, Rama gave leave to well-pleased Sugriva the king<br>of the monkeys, along with all his followers, as also to rejoicing<br>Vibhishana of Pulastya's race, to return to their respective abodes. And<br>having worshipped them with various articles of enjoyment, and done<br>everything that was suitable to the occasion, Rama dismissed those<br>friends of his with a sorrowful heart. And the son of Raghu then, having<br>worshiped that Pushpaka chariot, joyfully gave it back unto Vaisravana.<br>And then assisted by the celestial Rishi (Vasishtha), Rama performed on<br>the banks of the Gomati ten horse-sacrifices without obstruction of any<br>kind and with treble presents unto Brahmanas.'"
