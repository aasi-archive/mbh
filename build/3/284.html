                            "Markandeya said, "Then Prahasta, suddenly advancing up to Vibhishana and<br>uttering a loud yell, struck him with his mace. But though struck with<br>that mace of terrible force, the mighty-armed Vibhishana of great wisdom,<br>without wavering in the least, stood still as the mountains of Himavat.<br>Then Vibhishana, taking up a huge and mighty javelin furnished with a<br>hundred bells, inspired it with mantras and hurled it at the head of his<br>adversary. And by the impetuosity of that weapon rushing with the force<br>of the thunderbolt, Prahasta's head was severed off, and he thereupon<br>looked like a mighty tree broken by the wind. And beholding that wanderer<br>of the night, Prahasta, thus slain in battle, Dhumraksha rushed with<br>great impetuosity against the monkey-host. And beholding the soldiers of<br>Dhumraksha, looking like the clouds and endued with terrible mien,<br>advancing up towards them, the monkey-chief suddenly broke and fled. And<br>seeing those foremost of monkeys suddenly give way, that tiger among<br>monkeys, Hanuman, the son of Pavana, began to advance. And beholding the<br>son of Pavana staying still on the field of battle, the retreating<br>monkeys, O king, one and all quickly rallied. Then mighty and great and<br>fearful was the uproar that arose there in consequence of the warriors of<br>Rama and Ravana rushing against each other. And in that battle which<br>raged terribly the field soon became miry with blood. And Dhumraksha<br>afflicted the monkey-host with volleys of winged shafts. Then that<br>vanquisher of foes, Hanuman, the son of Pavana, quickly seized that<br>advancing leader of the Rakshasa. And the encounter that took place<br>between that monkey and the Rakshasa hero, is desirous of defeating the<br>other, was fierce and terrible, like that of Indra and Prahlada (in days<br>of yore). And the Rakshasa struck the monkey with his maces and spiked<br>clubs while the monkey struck the Rakshasa with trunks of trees unshorn<br>of their branches. Then Hanuman, the son of Pavana, slew in great wrath<br>that Rakshasa along with his charioteer and horses and broke his chariot<br>also into pieces. And beholding Dhumraksha, that foremost of Rakshasa,<br>thus slain, the monkeys, abandoning all fear, rushed against the Rakshasa<br>army with great valour. And slaughtered in large numbers by the<br>victorious and powerful monkeys, the Rakshasas became dispirited and fled<br>in fear to Lanka. And the surviving wreck of the Rakshasa army, having<br>reached the city, informed king Ravana of everything that had happened.<br>And hearing from them that Prahasta and that mighty archer Dhumraksha,<br>had both, with their armies, been slain by the powerful monkeys, Ravana<br>drew a deep sigh and springing up from his excellent seat, said,&#8212;the<br>time is come for Kumbhakarna to act.&#8212;And having said this, he awake, by<br>means of various loud-sounding instruments, his brother Kumbhakarna from<br>his deep and prolonged slumbers. And having awaked him with great<br>efforts, the Rakshasa king, still afflicted with anxiety, addressed the<br>mighty Kumbhakarna and said unto him when seated at his ease on his bed,<br>having perfectly recovered consciousness and self-possession, these<br>words, 'Thou, indeed, art happy, O Kumbhakarna, that canst enjoy profound<br>and undisturbed repose, unconscious of the terrible calamity that hath<br>overtaken us! Rama with his monkey host hath crossed the Ocean by a<br>bridge and disregarding us all is waging a terrible war (against us). I<br>have stealthily brought away his wife Sita, the daughter of Janaka. and<br>it is to recover her that he hath come hither, after having made a bridge<br>over the great Ocean. Our great kinsmen also, Prahasta and others, have<br>already been slain by him. And, O scourge of thy enemies, there is not<br>another person, save thee, that can slay Rama! Therefore, O warrior,<br>putting on thy armour, do thou set out this day for the purpose of<br>vanquishing Rama and his followers! The two younger brothers of Dushana,<br>viz., Vajravega and Promathin, will join thee with their forces!' And<br>having said this unto the mighty Kumbhakarna. the Rakshasa king gave<br>instructions to Vajravega and Promathin as to what they should do. And<br>accepting his advice, those two warlike brothers of Dushana quickly<br>marched out of the city, preceded by Kumbhakarna."
