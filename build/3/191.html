                            Janamejaya said, "It behoveth thee to narrate to me in full the greatness<br>of the Brahmanas even as the mighty ascetic Markandeya had expounded it<br>to the sons of Pandu."<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'The eldest son of Pandu had asked Markandeya saying,<br>'It behoveth thee to expound to me the greatness of Brahmanas.'<br>Markandeya answered him saying, 'Hear, O king, about the behaviour of<br>Brahmanas in days of old.'<br><br>"And Markandeya continued, 'There was a king, by name Parikshit in<br>Ayodhya and belonging to the race of Ikshvaku. And once upon a time<br>Parikshit went a-hunting. And as he was riding alone on a horse chasing<br>deer, the animal led him to a great distance (from the habitations of<br>men). And fatigued by the distance he had ridden and afflicted with<br>hunger and thirst he beheld in that part of the country whither he had<br>been led, a dark and dense forest, and the king, beholding that forest,<br>entered it and seeing a delightful tank within the forest, both the rider<br>and the horse bathed in it, and refreshed by the bath and placing before<br>his horse some stalks and fibres of the lotus, the king sat by the side<br>of the tank. And while he was lying by the side of the tank, he heard<br>certain sweet strains of music, and hearing those strains, he reflected,<br>'I do not see here the foot-prints of men. Whose and whence then these<br>strains?' And the king soon beheld a maiden of great beauty gathering<br>flowers singing all the while, and the maiden soon came before the king,<br>and the king thereupon asked her, 'Blessed one, who art thou and whose?'<br>And she replied, 'I am a maiden.' And the king said, 'I ask thee to be<br>mine.' And the maiden answered, 'Give me a pledge, for then only I can be<br>thine, else not.' And the king then asked about the pledge and the girl<br>answered. 'Thou wilt never make me cast my eyes on water', and the king<br>saying, 'So be it,' married her, and king Parikshit having married her<br>sported (with her) in great joy, and sat with her in silence, and while<br>the king was staying there, his troops reached the spot, and those troops<br>beholding the monarch stood surrounding him, and cheered by the presence<br>of troops, the king entered a handsome vehicle accompanied by his (newly)<br>wedded wife. And having arrived at his capital he began to live with her<br>in privacy. And persons that were even near enough to the king could not<br>obtain any interview with him and the minister-in-chief enquired of those<br>females that waited upon the king, asking, 'What do ye do here?' And<br>those women replied, 'We behold here a female of unrivalled beauty. And<br>the king sporteth with her, having married her with a pledge that he<br>would never show her water.' And hearing those words, the<br>minister-in-chief caused an artificial forest to be created, consisting<br>of many trees with abundant flowers and fruits, and he caused to be<br>excavated within that forest and towards one of its sides a large tank,<br>placed in a secluded spot and full of water that was sweet as Amrita. The<br>tank was well covered with a net of pearls. Approaching the king one day<br>in private, he addressed the king saying, 'This is a fine forest without<br>water. Sport thou here joyfully!' And the king at those words of his<br>minister entered that forest with that adorable wife of his, and the king<br>sported with her in that delightful forest, and afflicted with hunger and<br>thirst and fatigued and spent, the king beheld a bower of Madhavi<br>creepers[48] and entering that bower with his dear one, the king beheld a<br>tank full of water that was transparent and bright as nectar, and<br>beholding that tank, the king sat on its bank with her and the king told<br>his adorable wife, 'Cheerfully do thou plunge into this water!' And she,<br>hearing those words plunged into the tank. But having plunged into the<br>water she appeared not above the surface, and as the king searched, he<br>failed to discover any trace of her. And the king ordered the waters of<br>the tank to be baled out, and thereupon he beheld a frog sitting at the<br>mouth of a hole, and the king was enraged at this and promulgated an<br>order saying, 'Let frogs be slaughtered everywhere in my dominions!<br>Whoever wishes to have an interview with me must come before me with a<br>tribute of dead frogs.' And accordingly when frogs began to be terribly<br>slaughtered, the affrighted frogs represented all that had happened unto<br>their king, and the king of the frogs assuming the garb of an ascetic<br>came before the king Parikshit, and having approached the monarch, he<br>said, 'O king, give not thyself up to wrath! Be inclined to grace. It<br>behoveth thee not to slay the innocent frogs.' Here occurs a couple of<br>Slokas. (They are these):&#8212;'O thou of unfading glory, slay not the frogs!<br>Pacify thy wrath! The prosperity and ascetic merits of those that have<br>their souls steeped in ignorance suffer diminution! Pledge thyself not to<br>be angry with the frogs! What need hast thou to commit such sin! What<br>purpose will be served by slaying the frogs!' Then king Parikshit whose<br>soul was filled with woe on account of the death of her that was dear to<br>him, answered the chief of the frogs who had spoken to him thus, 'I will<br>not forgive the frogs. On the other hand, I will slay them. By these<br>wicked wretches hath my dear one been swallowed up. The frogs, therefore,<br>always deserve to be killed by me. It behoveth thee not, O learned one,<br>to intercede on their behalf.' And hearing these words of Parikshit, the<br>king of the frogs with his senses and mind much pained said, 'Be inclined<br>to grace, O king! I am the king of the frogs by name Ayu. She who was thy<br>wife is my daughter of the name of Susobhana. This, indeed, is an<br>instance of her bad conduct. Before this, many kings were deceived by<br>her.' The king thereupon said to him, 'I desire to have her. Let her be<br>granted to me by thee!' The king of the frogs thereupon bestowed his<br>daughter upon Parikshit, and addressing her said, 'Wait upon and serve<br>the king.' And having spoken these words to his daughter, he also<br>addressed her in wrath saying, 'Since thou hast deceived many Kings for<br>this untruthful behaviour of thine, thy offspring will prove<br>disrespectful to Brahmanas!' But having obtained her, the king became<br>deeply enamoured of her in consequence of her companionable virtues, and<br>feeling that he had, as it were, obtained the sovereignty of the three<br>worlds, he bowed down to the king of the frogs and reverenced him in due<br>form and then with utterance choked in joy and tears said, 'I have been<br>favoured indeed!' And the king of the frogs obtaining the leave of his<br>daughter, returned to the place from which he had come and some time<br>after the king begot three sons upon her and those sons were named Sala<br>and Dala and Vala, and some time after, their father, installing the<br>eldest of them of all on the throne and setting his heart on asceticism,<br>retired into the forest. One day Sala while out a-hunting, beheld a deer<br>and pursued it, on his car, and the prince said to his charioteer, 'Drive<br>thou fast.' And the charioteer, thus addressed, replied unto the king,<br>saying, 'Do not entertain such a purpose. This deer is incapable of being<br>caught by thee. If indeed Vami horses had been yoked to thy car, then<br>couldst thou have taken it.' Thereupon the king addressed his charioteer,<br>saying, 'Tell me all about Vami horses, otherwise I will slay thee,' Thus<br>addressed the charioteer became dreadfully alarmed and he was afraid of<br>the king and also of Vamadeva's curse and told not the king anything and<br>the king then lifting up his scimitar said to him, 'Tell me soon, else I<br>will slay thee.' At last afraid of the king, the charioteer said, 'The<br>Vami horses are those belonging to Vamadeva; they are fleet as the mind.'<br>And unto his charioteer who had said so, the king said, 'Repair thou to<br>the asylum of Vamadeva.' And reaching the asylum of Vamadeva the king<br>said unto that Rishi, 'O holy one, a deer struck by me is flying away. It<br>behoveth thee to make it capable of being seized by me by granting me thy<br>pair of Vami horses.' The Rishi then answered him saying, 'I give thee my<br>pair of Vami horses. But after accomplishing thy object, my Vami pair you<br>should soon return.' The king then taking those steeds and obtaining the<br>leave of the Rishi pursued the deer, having yoked the Vami pair unto his<br>car, and after he had left the asylum he spoke unto his charioteer<br>saying, 'These jewels of steeds the Brahmanas do not deserve to possess.<br>These should not be returned to Vamadeva.' Having said this and seized<br>the deer he returned to his capital and placed those steeds within the<br>inner apartments of the palace.<br><br>"Meanwhile the Rishi reflected, 'The prince is young. Having obtained an<br>excellent pair of animals, he is sporting with it in joy without<br>returning it to me. Alas, what a pity it is!' And reflecting in this<br>strain, the Rishi said unto a disciple of his, after the expiration of a<br>month, 'Go, O Atreya, and say to the king that if he has done with the<br>Vami steeds, he should return them unto thy preceptor.' And the disciple<br>Atreya, thereupon, repairing to the king, spoke unto him as instructed,<br>and the king replied saying, 'This pair of steeds deserves to be owned by<br>kings. The Brahmanas do not deserve to possess jewels of such value. What<br>business have Brahmanas with horses? Return thou contentedly!' And<br>Atreya, thus addressed by the king, returned and told his preceptor all<br>that had happened, and hearing this sad intelligence, Vamadeva's heart<br>was filled with wrath, and repairing in person to the king he asked him<br>for his steeds, and the king refused to give the Rishi what the latter<br>asked, and Vamadeva said, 'O lord of earth, give me thou my Vami horses.<br>By them hast thou accomplished a task which was almost incapable of being<br>accomplished by thee. By transgressing the practices of Brahmanas and<br>Kshatriyas, subject not thyself, O king, to death by means of the<br>terrible noose of Varuna.' And hearing this, the king answered, 'O<br>Vamadeva, this couple of excellent well-trained, and docile bulls are fit<br>animals for Brahmanas. O great Rishi, (take them and) go with them<br>wherever thou likest. Indeed, the very Vedas carry persons like thee.'<br>Then Vamadeva said, 'O king, the Vedas do, indeed, carry persons like us.<br>But that is in the world hereafter. In this world, however, O king,<br>animals like these carry me and persons like me as also all others.' At<br>this the king answered, 'Let four assess carry thee, or four mules of the<br>best kind, or even four steeds endued with the speed of the wind. Go thou<br>with these. This pair of Vami horses, however, deserves to be owned by<br>Kshatriyas. Know thou, therefore, that these are not thine.' At this,<br>Vamadeva said, 'O king, terrible vows have been ordained for the<br>Brahmanas. If I have lived in their observance, let four fierce and<br>mighty Rakshasas of terrible mien and iron bodies, commanded by me,<br>pursue thee with desire of slaying, and carry thee on their sharp lances,<br>having cut up thy body into four parts.' Hearing this, the king said,<br>'Let those, O Vamadeva, that know thee as a Brahmana that in thought,<br>word, and deed, is desirous of taking life, at my command, armed with<br>bright lances and swords prostrate thee with thy disciples before me.'<br>Then Vamadeva answered, 'O king, having obtained these my Vami steeds,<br>thou hadst said, 'I will return them.' Therefore, give me back my Vami<br>steeds, so thou mayst be able to protect thy life.' Hearing this, the<br>king said, 'Pursuit of deer hath not been ordained for the Brahmanas. I<br>do punish thee, however, for thy untruthfulness. From this day, too,<br>obeying all thy commands I will, O Brahmana, attain to regions of bliss.'<br>Vamadeva then said, 'A Brahmana cannot be punished in thought, word or<br>deed. That learned person who by ascetic austerities succeedeth in<br>knowing a Brahmana to be so, faileth not to attain to prominence in this<br>world.'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'After Vamadeva had said this, there arose, O<br>king, (four) Rakshasas of terrible mien, and as they, with lances in<br>their hands, approached the king for slaying him, the latter cried aloud,<br>saying, 'If, O Brahmana, all the descendants of Ikshvaku's race, if (my<br>brother) Dala, if all these Vaisyas acknowledge my sway, then I will not<br>yield up the Vami steeds to Vamadeva, for these men can never be<br>virtuous.' And while he was uttering those words, those Rakshasas slew<br>him, and the lord of earth was soon prostrated on the ground. And the<br>Ikshvakus, learning that their king had been slain, installed Dala on the<br>throne, and the Brahmana Vamadeva thereupon going to the kingdom (of the<br>Ikshvakus), addressed the new monarch, saying, 'O king, it hath been<br>declared in all the sacred books that persons should give away unto<br>Brahmanas. If thou fearest sin, O king, give me now the Vami steeds<br>without delay.' And hearing these words of Vamadeva, the king in anger<br>spoke unto his charioteer, saying, 'Bring me an arrow from those I have<br>kept, which is handsome to behold and tempered with poison, so that<br>pierced by it Vamadeva may lie prostrate in pain, torn by the dogs.'<br>Hearing this, Vamadeva answered, 'I know, O king, that thou hast a son of<br>ten years of age, called Senajita, begotten upon thy queen. Urged by my<br>word, slay thou that dear boy of thine without delay by means of thy<br>frightful arrows!'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'At these words of Vamadeva, O king, that arrow of<br>fierce energy, shot by the monarch, slew the prince in the inner<br>apartments, and hearing this, Dala said there and then, 'Ye people of<br>Ikshvaku's race, I will do ye good. I shall slay this Brahmana today,<br>grinding him with force. Bring me another arrow of fierce energy. Ye<br>lords of earth, behold my prowess now.' And at these words of Dala,<br>Vamadeva said, 'This arrow of terrible mien and tempered with poison,<br>that thou aimest at me, thou shall not, O ruler of men, be able to aim<br>nor even to shoot.' And thereupon the king said, 'Ye men of Ikshvaku's<br>race, behold me incapable of shooting the arrow that hath been taken up<br>by me. I fail to compass the death of this Brahmana. Let Vamadeva who is<br>blessed with a long life live.' Then Vamadeva said, 'Touching thy queen<br>with this arrow, thou mayst purge thyself of the sin (of attempting to<br>take the life of a Brahmana).' And king Dala did as he was directed and<br>the queen then addressed the Muni, and said, 'O Vamadeva, let me be able<br>to duly instruct this wretched husband of mine from day to day, imparting<br>unto him words of happy import; and let me always wait upon and serve the<br>Brahmanas, and by this acquire, O Brahmana, the sacred regions<br>hereafter.' And hearing these words of the queen, Vamadeva said, 'O thou<br>of beautiful eyes, thou hast saved this royal race. Beg thou an<br>incomparable boon. I will grant thee whatever thou mayst ask. And, O thou<br>faultless one, rule thou, O princess, these thy kinsmen and this great<br>kingdom of the Ikshvakus!' And hearing these words of Vamadeva the<br>princess said, 'This, O holy one, is the boon I seek, viz., that my<br>husband may now be freed from his sin, and that thou mayst be employed in<br>thinking of the weal of his son and kinsmen. This is the boon that I ask,<br>O thou foremost of Brahmanas!'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Hearing these words of the queen, that Muni, O<br>thou foremost of the Kuru race, said, 'So be it.' And thereupon king Dala<br>became highly glad and gave unto the Muni his Vami steeds, having bowed<br>down unto him with reverence!'"
