                            (Draupadi-Satyabhama Samvada)<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "After those Brahmanas and the illustrious sons of<br>Pandu had taken their seats, Draupadi and Satyabhama entered the<br>hermitage. And with hearts full of joy the two ladies laughed merrily and<br>seated themselves at their ease. And, O king, those ladies, who always<br>spake sweetly to each other, having met after a long time, began to talk<br>upon various delightful topics arising out of the stories of the Kurus<br>and the Yadus. And the slender-waisted Satyabhama, the favourite wife of<br>Krishna and the daughter of Satrajit, then asked Draupadi in private,<br>saying, 'By what behaviour is it, O daughter of Drupada, that thou art<br>able to rule the sons of Pandu&#8212;those heroes endued with strength and<br>beauty and like unto the Lokapalas themselves? Beautiful lady, how is it<br>that they are so obedient to thee and are never angry with thee? Without<br>doubt the sons of Pandu, O thou of lovely features, are ever submissive<br>to thee and watchful to do thy bidding! Tell me, O lady, the reason of<br>this. Is it practice of vows, or asceticism, or incantation or drug at<br>the time of the bath (in season) or the efficacy of science, or the<br>influence of youthful appearance, or the recitation of particular<br>formulae, or Homa, or collyrium and other medicaments? Tell me now, O<br>princess of Panchala, of that blessed and auspicious thing by which, O<br>Krishna, Krishna may ever be obedient to me."<br><br>"When the celebrated Satyabhama, having said this, ceased, the chaste and<br>blessed daughter of Drupada answered her, saying, 'Thou askedest me, O<br>Satyabhama, of the practices of women that are wicked. How can I answer<br>thee, O lady, about the cause that is pursued by wicked females? It doth<br>not become thee, lady, to pursue the questions, or doubt me, after this,<br>for thou art endued with intelligence and art the favourite wife of<br>Krishna. When the husband learns that his wife is addicted to<br>incantations and drugs, from that hour he beginneth to dread her like a<br>serpent ensconced in his sleeping chamber. And can a man that is troubled<br>with fear have peace, and how can one that hath no peace have happiness?<br>A husband can never be made obedient by his wife's incantations. We hear<br>of painful diseases being transmitted by enemies. Indeed, they that<br>desire to slay others, send poison in the shape of customary gifts, so<br>that the man that taketh the powders so sent, by tongue or skin, is,<br>without doubt, speedily deprived of life. Women have sometimes caused<br>dropsy and leprosy, decrepitude and impotence and idiocy and blindness<br>and deafness in men. These wicked women, ever treading in the path of<br>sin, do sometimes (by these means) injure their husbands. But the wife<br>should never do the least injury to her lord. Hear now, O illustrious<br>lady, of the behaviour I adopt towards the high-souled sons of Pandu.<br>Keeping aside vanity, and controlling desire and wrath, I always serve<br>with devotion the sons of Pandu with their wives. Restraining jealousy,<br>with deep devotion of heart, without a sense of degradation at the<br>services I perform, I wait upon my husbands. Ever fearing to utter what<br>is evil or false, or to look or sit or walk with impropriety, or cast<br>glances indicative of the feelings of the heart, do I serve the sons of<br>Pritha&#8212;those mighty warriors blazing like the sun or fire, and handsome<br>as the moon, those endued with fierce energy and prowess, and capable of<br>slaying their foes by a glance of the eye. Celestial, or man, or<br>Gandharva, young or decked with ornaments, wealthy or comely of person,<br>none else my heart liketh. I never bathe or eat or sleep till he that is<br>my husband hath bathed or eaten or slept,&#8212;till, in fact, our attendants<br>have bathed, eaten, or slept. Whether returning from the field, the<br>forest, or the town, hastily rising up I always salute my husband with<br>water and a seat. I always keep the house and all household articles and<br>the food that is to be taken well-ordered and clean. Carefully do I keep<br>the rice, and serve the food at the proper time. I never indulge in angry<br>and fretful speech, and never imitate women that are wicked. Keeping<br>idleness at distance I always do what is agreeable. I never laugh except<br>at a jest, and never stay for any length of time at the house-gate. I<br>never stay long in places for answering calls of nature, nor in<br>pleasure-gardens attached to the house. I always refrain from laughing<br>loudly and indulging in high passion, and from everything that may give<br>offence. Indeed, O Satyabhama, I always am engaged in waiting upon my<br>lords. A separation from my lords is never agreeable to me. When my<br>husband leaveth home for the sake of any relative, then renouncing<br>flowers and fragrant paste of every kind, I begin to undergo penances.<br>Whatever my husband drinketh not, whatever my husband eateth not,<br>whatever my husband enjoyeth not, I ever renounce. O beautiful lady,<br>decked in ornaments and ever controlled by the instruction imparted to<br>me, I always devotedly seek the good of my lord. Those duties that my<br>mother-in-law had told me of in respect of relatives, as also the duties<br>of alms-giving, of offering worship to the gods, of oblations to the<br>diseased, of boiling food in pots on auspicious days for offer to<br>ancestors and guests of reverence and service to those that deserve our<br>regards, and all else that is known to me, I always discharge day and<br>night, without idleness of any kind. Having with my whole heart recourse<br>to humility and approved rules I serve my meek and truthful lords ever<br>observant of virtue, regarding them as poisonous snakes capable of being<br>excited at a trifle. I think that to be eternal virtue for women which is<br>based upon a regard for the husband. The husband is the wife's god, and<br>he is her refuge. Indeed, there is no other refuge for her. How can,<br>then, the wife do the least injury to her lord? I never, in sleeping or<br>eating or adorning any person, act against the wishes of my lord, and<br>always guided by my husbands, I never speak ill of my mother-in-law. O<br>blessed lady, my husbands have become obedient to me in consequence of my<br>diligence, my alacrity, and the humility with which I serve superiors.<br>Personally do I wait every day with food and drink and clothes upon the<br>revered and truthful Kunti&#8212;that mother of heroes. Never do I show any<br>preference for myself over her in matters of food and attire, and never<br>do I reprove in words that princess equal unto the Earth herself in<br>forgiveness. Formerly, eight thousand Brahmanas were daily fed in the<br>palace of Yudhishthira from off plates of gold. And eighty thousand<br>Brahmanas also of the Snataka sect leading domestic lives were<br>entertained by Yudhishthira with thirty serving-maids assigned to each.<br>Besides these, ten thousand yatis with the vital seed drawn up, had their<br>pure food carried unto them in plates of gold. All these Brahamanas that<br>were the utterers of the Veda, I used to worship duly with food, drink,<br>and raiment taken from stores only after a portion thereof had been<br>dedicated to the Viswadeva.[82] The illustrious son of Kunti had a<br>hundred thousand well-dressed serving-maids with bracelets on arms and<br>golden ornaments on necks, and decked with costly garlands and wreaths<br>and gold in profusion, and sprinkled with sandal paste. And adorned with<br>jewels and gold they were all skilled in singing and dancing. O lady, I<br>knew the names and features of all those girls, as also what they are and<br>what they were, and what they did not. Kunti's son of great intelligence<br>had also a hundred thousand maid-servants who daily used to feed guests,<br>with plates of gold in their hands. And while Yudhishthira lived in<br>Indraprastha a hundred thousand horses and a hundred thousand elephants<br>used to follow in his train. These were the possessions of Yudhisthira<br>while he ruled the earth. It was I however, O lady, who regulated their<br>number and framed the rules to be observed in respect of them; and it was<br>I who had to listen to all complaints about them. Indeed, I knew<br>everything about what the maid-servants of the palace and other classes<br>of attendants, even the cow-herds and the shepherds of the royal<br>establishment, did or did not. O blessed and illustrious lady, it was I<br>alone amongst the Pandavas who knew the income and expenditure of the<br>king and what their whole wealth was. And those bulls among the Bharatas,<br>throwing upon me the burden of looking after all those that were to be<br>fed by them, would, O thou of handsome face, pay their court to me. And<br>this load, so heavy and incapable of being borne by persons of evil<br>heart, I used to bear day and night, sacrificing my ease, and all the<br>while affectionately devoted to them. And while my husbands were engaged<br>in the pursuit of virtue, I only supervised their treasury inexhaustible<br>like the ever-filled receptacle of Varuna. Day and night bearing hunger<br>and thirst, I used to serve the Kuru princes, so that my nights and days<br>were equal to me. I used to wake up first and go to bed last. This, O<br>Satyabhama, hath ever been my charm for making my husbands obedient to<br>me! This great art hath ever been known to me for making my husbands<br>obedient to me. Never have I practised the charms of wicked women, nor do<br>I ever wish to practise them."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Hearing those words of virtuous import uttered<br>by Krishna, Satyabhama, having first reverenced the virtuous princess of<br>Panchala, answered saying, 'O princess of Panchala, I have been guilty, O<br>daughter of Yajnasena, forgive me! Among friends, conversations in jest<br>arise naturally, and without premeditation."
