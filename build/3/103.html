                            "The celestials said, 'Through thy favour it is that all born beings of<br>the four kinds increase. And they being created, propitiate the dwellers<br>of heaven by offerings made to the gods and the names of departed<br>forefathers. Thus it is that people, protected by thee and free from<br>trouble live depending on one another, and (so) increase. Now this peril<br>hath befallen the people. We do not know by whom are Brahmanas being<br>killed during the night. If the Brahmanas are destroyed, the earth itself<br>will meet with destruction, and if the earth cometh to an end, heaven<br>also will cease to exist. O mighty-armed one, O lord of the universe! we<br>beseech thee (to act so) that all the worlds, protected by thee, may not<br>come to an end, so it may please thee.'<br><br>"Vishnu said, 'Ye gods! To me is known the reason of the destruction of<br>the born beings, I shall speak of it to you; listen with minds free from<br>tribulation. There exists an exceedingly fierce host, known by the name<br>of Kalakeyas. They, under the lead of Vritra, were devastating the whole<br>universe. And when they saw that Vritra was slain by the sagacious Indra<br>endued with a thousand eyes, they, to preserve their lives, entered into<br>the ocean, that abode of Varuna. And having entered the ocean, abounding<br>with sharks and crocodiles, they at night killed the saints at this spot<br>with the view of exterminating the people. But they cannot be slain, as<br>they have taken shelter within the sea. Ye should, therefore, think of<br>some expedient to dry up the ocean. Who save Agastya is capable of drying<br>up the sea. And without drying up the ocean, these (demons) cannot be<br>assailed by any other means.' Hearing these words of Vishnu, the gods<br>took the permission of Brahma, who lives at the best of all regions, and<br>went to the hermitage of Agastya. Then they beheld the high-souled<br>Agastya, the son of Varuna, of resplendent mien, and waited upon by<br>saints, even as Brahma is waited upon by celestials. And approaching him,<br>they addressed the son of Mitra and Varuna at the hermitage, magnanimous<br>and unswerving, and looking like an embodiment of pious works piled<br>together, and glorified him by reciting his deeds. The deities said,<br>'Thou wert formerly the refuge of the gods when they were oppressed by<br>Nahusha. Thorn of the world that he was, he was thrown down from his<br>throne of heaven&#8212;from the celestial regions. Vindhya, the foremost of<br>all mountains, suddenly began to increase his height, from a wrathful<br>competition with the sun (i. e., to rival him in altitude). But he hath<br>ceased to increase, as he was unable to disobey thy command. And when<br>darkness hath covered the world, the born beings were harassed by death,<br>but having obtained thee for a protector, they attained the utmost<br>security. Whenever we are beset by perils, thy reverence is always our<br>refuge; for this reason it is that we solicit a boon from thee; as thou<br>ever grantest the boon solicited (of thee).'"
