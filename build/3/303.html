                            Vaisampayana said, "And that maiden of rigid vows. O mighty monarch, by<br>serving with a pure heart, that Brahmana of rigid vows, succeeded in<br>gratifying him. And, O foremost of kings, saying, 'I will come back in<br>the morning,' that best of Brahmanas sometimes came in the evening or in<br>night. Him, however, the maiden worshipped at all hours with sumptuous<br>food and drink and bed. And as day after day passed away, her attentions<br>to him, in respect of food and seat and bed, increased instead of<br>undergoing any diminution. And, O king, even when the Brahmana reproved<br>her, finding fault with any of her arrangements, or addressed her in<br>harsh words, Pritha did not do anything that was disagreeable to him. And<br>on many occasions the Brahmana came back after the appointed hour had<br>long passed away. And on many occasions (such as the depth of night) when<br>food was hard to procure, he said, 'Give me food!' But on all those<br>occasions saying, 'All is ready,'&#8212;Pritha held before him the fare. And<br>even like a disciple, daughter, or a sister, that blameless gem of a girl<br>with a devoted heart, O king, gratified that foremost of Brahmanas. And<br>that best of Brahmanas became well-pleased with her conduct and<br>ministrations. And he received those attentions of hers, valuing them<br>rightly. And, O Bharata, her father asked her every morning and evening<br>saying, "O daughter, is the Brahmana satisfied with thy ministrations?<br>And that illustrious maiden used to reply, 'Exceedingly well!' And<br>thereupon, the high-souled Kuntibhoja experienced the greatest delight.<br>And when after a full year that best of ascetics was unable to find any<br>fault whatever in Pritha, who was engaged in ministering unto him,<br>well-pleased he said unto her, 'O gentle maid, I have been well-pleased<br>with thy attentions, O beautiful girl! Do thou, O blessed girl, ask even<br>for such boons as are difficult of being obtained by men in this world,<br>and obtaining which, thou mayst surpass in fame all the women in this<br>world'. At these words of his, Kunti said, 'Everything hath already been<br>done in my behalf since thou, O chief of those that are versed in the<br>Vedas, and my father also, have been pleased with me! As regards the<br>boons, I consider them as already obtained by me, O Brahmana!' The<br>Brahmana thereupon said, 'If, O gentle maid, thou dost not, O thou of<br>sweet smiles, wish to obtain boons from me, do thou then take this mantra<br>from me for invoking the celestials! Any one amongst the celestials whom<br>thou mayst invoke by uttering this mantra, will appear before thee and be<br>under thy power. Willing or not, by virtue of this mantra, that deity in<br>gentle guise, and assuming the obedient attitude of slave, will become<br>subject to thy power!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed, that faultless maiden could-not,<br>O king, from fear of a curse, refuse tor the second time compliance with<br>the wishes of that best of the twice-born ones. Then, O king, that<br>Brahmana imparted unto that girl of faultless limbs those mantras which<br>are recited in the beginning of the Atharvan Veda. And, O king, having<br>imparted unto her those mantras, he said unto Kuntibhoja. 'I have, O<br>monarch, dwelt happily in thy house, always worshipped with due regard<br>and gratified by thy daughter. I shall now depart.' And saying this, he<br>vanished there and then. And beholding that Brahmana vanish there and<br>then, the king was struck with amazement. And the monarch then treated<br>his daughter Pritha with proper regard."
