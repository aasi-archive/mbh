                            Yudhishthira said, 'O best of speakers! what was the extent of power and<br>strength possessed by king Somaka? I am desirous of hearing an exact<br>account of his deeds and of his power."<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'O Yudhishthira! there was a virtuous king Somaka by name.<br>He had one hundred wives, O king, all suitably matched to their husband.<br>He took great care, but could not succeed in getting a single son from<br>any one of them, and a long time elapsed during which he continued a<br>sonless man. Once upon a time, when he had become old, and was trying<br>every means to have a son, a son was born to him, Jantu by name, out of<br>that century of women. And, O ruler of men! All the mothers used to sit<br>surrounding their son and every one giving him such objects as might<br>conduce to his enjoyment and pleasure. And it came to pass that one day<br>an ant stung the boy at his hip. And the boy screamed loudly on account<br>of the pain caused by the sting. And forthwith the mothers were<br>exceedingly distressed to see how the child had been stung by the ant.<br>And they stood around him and set up cries. Thus there arose a tumultuous<br>noise. And that scream of pain suddenly reached (the ears of) the<br>sovereign of the earth, when he was seated in the midst of his ministers,<br>with the family priest at his side. Then the king sent for information as<br>to what it was about. And the royal usher explained to him precisely what<br>the matter was with reference to his son. And Somaka got up together with<br>his ministers and hastened towards the female apartments. And on coming<br>there, O subjugator of foes! he soothed his son. And having done so and<br>coming out from the female apartments, the king sat with his family<br>priest and ministers.'<br><br>"Somaka then spoke thus, 'Fie on having only a single son! I had rather<br>be a sonless man. Considering how constantly liable to disease are all<br>organized beings, to have an only son is but a trouble. O Brahmana! O my<br>lord! With the view that I might have many sons born to me, this century<br>of wives hath been wedded by me, after inspection, and after I had<br>satisfied myself that they would prove suitable to me. But issue they<br>have none. Having tried every means, and put forth great efforts, they<br>have borne this single son, Jantu. What grief can be greater than this? O<br>most excellent of the twice-born caste! I am grown old in years and so<br>are my wives too. And yet this only son is like the breath of their<br>nostrils, and so he is to me also. But is there any ceremony, by<br>celebrating which one may get a hundred sons? (And if there is one such),<br>tell me whether it is great or small, and easy or difficult to perform.'<br><br>"The family priest said, 'There is a ceremony by virtue of which a man<br>may get a century of sons. If thou art able to perform it, O Somaka, then<br>I shall explain it to thee.'<br><br>"Somaka said, 'Whether it be a good or an evil deed, the ceremony by<br>which a hundred sons may be born, may be taken by thee as already<br>performed. Let thy blessed self explain it to me.'<br><br>"The family priest thereupon said, 'O king! Let me set on foot a<br>sacrifice and thou must sacrifice thy son, Jantu in it. Then on no<br>distant date, a century of handsome sons will be born to thee. When<br>Jantu's fat will be put into the fire as an offering to the gods, the<br>mothers will take a smell of that smoke, and bring forth a number of<br>sons, valourous and strong. And Jantu also will once more be born as a<br>self-begotten son of thine in that very (mother); and on his back there<br>will appear a mark of gold.'"
