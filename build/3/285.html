                            "Markandeya said, "Then Kumbhakarna set out from the city, accompanied by<br>his followers. And soon he beheld the victorious monkey troops encamped<br>before him. And passing them by with the object of seeking out Rama, he<br>beheld the son of Sumitra standing at his post, bow in hand. Then the<br>monkey warriors, speedily advancing towards him, surrounded him on all<br>sides. And then they commenced to strike him with numberless large trees.<br>And many amongst them fearlessly began to tear his body with their nails.<br>And those monkeys began to fight with him in various ways approved by the<br>laws of warfare. And they soon overwhelmed that chief of the Rakshasas<br>with a shower of terrible weapons of various kinds. And attacked by them<br>thus, Kumbhakarna only laughed at them and began to eat them up. And he<br>devoured those foremost of monkeys known by the name of Chala, and<br>Chandachala, and Vajravahu. And beholding that fearful act of the<br>Rakshasa, other monkeys were frightened and set forth a loud wail of<br>fear. And hearing the screams of those monkey-leaders, Sugriva boldly<br>advanced towards Kumbhakarna. And that high-souled king of the monkeys<br>swiftly approaching the Rakshasa, violently struck him on the head with<br>the trunk of a Sala tree. And though the high-souled Sugriva always<br>prompt in action broke that Sala tree on the head of Kumbhakarna, he<br>failed to make any impression on that Rakshasa. And then, as if roused<br>from his torpor by that blow, Kumbhakarna stretching forth his arms<br>seized Sugriva by main force. And beholding Sugriva dragged away by the<br>Rakshasa, the heroic son of Sumitra, that delighter of his friends,<br>rushed towards Kumbhakarna. And that slayer of hostile heroes, Lakshmana,<br>advancing towards Kumbhakarna, discharged at him an impetuous and mighty<br>arrow furnished with golden wings. And that arrow, cutting through his<br>coat of mail and penetrating into his body, passed through it outright<br>and struck into the earth, stained with the Rakshasa's blood. Kumbhakarna<br>then, having his breast thus bored through, released the king of monkeys.<br>And taking up a huge mass of stone as his weapon, the mighty warrior<br>Kumbhakarna then rushed towards the son of Sumitra, aiming it at him. And<br>as the Rakshasa rushed towards him, Lakshmana cut off his upraised arms<br>by means of a couple of keen-edged shafts furnished with heads resembling<br>razors. But as soon as the two arms of the Rakshasa were thus cut off,<br>double that number of arms soon appeared on his person. Sumitra's son,<br>however, displaying his skill in weapon, soon by means of similar arrows<br>cut off those arms also, each of which had seized a mass of stone. At<br>this, that Rakshasa assumed a form enormously huge and furnished with<br>numerous heads and legs and arms. Then the son of Sumitra rived, with a<br>Brahma weapon, that warrior looking like an assemblage of hill. And rent<br>by means of that celestial weapon, that Rakshasa fell on the field of<br>battle like a huge tree with spreading branches suddenly consumed by<br>heaven's thunderbolt. And beholding Kumbhakarna endued with great<br>activity and resembling the Asura Vritra himself, deprived of life and<br>prostrated on the field of battle, the Rakshasa warriors fled in fear.<br>And beholding the Rakshasa warriors running away from the field of<br>battle, the younger brother of Dushana, rallying them, rushed in great<br>wrath upon the son of Sumitra. Sumitra's son, however, with a loud roar,<br>received with his winged shafts both those wrathful warriors, Vajravega<br>and Promathin, rushing towards him. The battle then, O son of Pritha,<br>that took place between those two younger brothers of Dushana on the one<br>hand and the intelligent Lakshmana on the other, was exceedingly furious<br>and made the bristles of the spectators stand on end. And Lakshmana<br>overwhelmed the two Rakshasas with a perfect shower of arrows. And those<br>two Rakshasa heroes, on the other hand, both of them excited with fury,<br>covered Lakshmana with an arrowy hail. And that terrible encounter<br>between Vajravega and Promathin and the mighty-armed Lakshmana lasted for<br>a short while. And Hanumana, the son of Pavana, taking up a mountain<br>peak, rushed towards one of the brothers, and with that weapon took the<br>life of the Rakshasa Vajravega. And that mighty monkey, Nala, also, with<br>a large mass of rock, crushed Promathin, that other younger brother of<br>Dushana. The deadly struggle, however, between the soldiers of Rama and<br>Ravana, rushing against one another, instead of coming to an end even<br>after this, raged on as before. And hundreds of Rakshasas were slain by<br>the denizens of the forest, while many of the latter were slain by the<br>former. The loss, however, in killed, of the Rakshasas was far greater<br>than that of the monkeys.
