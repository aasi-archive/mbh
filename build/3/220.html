                            "Markandeya continued, 'The fire called Bharata was bound by severe rules<br>of asceticism. Pushtimati is another name of his fire; for when he is<br>satisfied he vouchsafes pushti (development) to all creatures, and for<br>this reason he is called Bharata (or the Cherisher). And that other fire,<br>by name Siva, is devoted to the worship of Sakti (the forces of the<br>presiding deity of the forces of Nature), and because he always relieves<br>the sufferings of all creatures afflicted with misery, he is called Siva<br>(the giver of good). And on the acquisition of great ascetic wealth by<br>Tapa, an intelligent son named Puranda was born to inherit the same.<br>Another son named Ushma was also born. This fire is observed in the<br>vapour of all matter. A third son Manu was born. He officiated as<br>Prajapati. The Brahmanas who are learned in the Vedas, then speak of the<br>exploits of the fire Sambhu. And after that the bright Avasathya fire of<br>great refulgence is spoken of by the Brahmanas. Tapa thus created the<br>five Urjaskara fires, all bright as gold. These all share the Soma drink<br>in sacrifices. The great sun-god when fatigued (after his day's labours)<br>is known as the Prasanta fire. He created the terrible Asuras and various<br>other creatures of the earth. Angiras, too created the Prajapati Bhanu,<br>the son of Tapa. He is also called Vrihadbhanu (the great Bhanu) by<br>Brahmanas learned in the Vedas. Bhanu married Supraja, and Brihadbhanu<br>the daughter of Surya (the sun-god). They gave birth to six sons; do thou<br>hear of their progeny. The fire who gives strength to the weak is called<br>Valada (or the giver of strength). He is the first son of Bhanu, and that<br>other fire who looks terrible when all the elements are in a tranquil<br>state is called the Manjuman fire; he is the second son of Bhanu. And the<br>fire in whose honour oblations of clarified butter are enjoined to be<br>made here at the Darsa and Paurnamasya sacrifices and who is known as<br>Vishnu in this world, is (the third son of Bhanu) called Angiras, or<br>Dhritiman. And the fire to whom with Indra, the Agrayana oblation is<br>enjoined to be made is called the Agrayana fire. He is the (fourth) son<br>of Bhanu. The fifth son of Bhanu is Agraha who is the source of the<br>oblations which are daily made for the performance of the Chaturmasya<br>(four-monthly) rites. And Stuva is the sixth son of Bhanu. Nisa was the<br>name of another wife of that Manu who is known by the name of Bhanu. She<br>gave birth to one daughter, the two Agnishomas, and also five other<br>fire-gods. The resplendent fire-god who is honoured with the first<br>oblations in company with the presiding deity of the clouds is called<br>Vaiswanara. And that other fire who is called the lord of all the worlds<br>is Viswapati, the second son of Manu. And the daughter of Manu is called<br>Swistakrit, because by oblations unto her one acquires great merit.<br>Though she was the daughter of Hiranyakasipu, she yet became his wife for<br>her evil deeds. She is, however, one of the Prajapatis. And that other<br>fire which has its seats in the vital airs of all creatures and animates<br>their bodies, is called Sannihita. It is the cause of our perceptions of<br>sound and form. That divine spirit whose course is marked with black and<br>white stains, who is the supporter of fire, and who, though free from<br>sin, is the accomplisher of desired karma, whom the wise regard as a<br>great Rishi, is the fire Kapila, the propounder of the Yoga system called<br>Sankhya. The fire through whom the elementary spirits always receive the<br>offerings called Agra made by other creatures at the performance of all<br>the peculiar rites in this world is called Agrani. And these other bright<br>fires famous in the world, were created for the rectification of the<br>Agnihotra rites when marred by any defects. If the fires interlap each<br>other by the action of the wind, then the rectification must be made with<br>the Ashtakapala rites in honour of the fire Suchi. And if the southern<br>fire comes in contact with the two other fires, then rectification must<br>be made by the performance of the Ashtakapala rites in honour of the fire<br>Viti. If the fires in their place called Nivesa come in contact with the<br>fire called Devagni, then the Ashtakapala rites must be performed in<br>honour of the fire Suchi for rectification. And if the perpetual fire is<br>touched by a woman in her monthly course, then for rectification the<br>Ashtakapala rites must be performed in honour of the fire called<br>Dasyuman. If at the time of the performance of this Agnihotra rites the<br>death of any creature is spoken of, or if animals die, then rectification<br>must be made with the performance of the Ashtakapala rites in honour of<br>the Suraman fire. The Brahmana, who while suffering from a disease is<br>unable to offer oblations to the sacred fire for three nights, must make<br>amends for the same by performing the Ashtakapala rites in honour of the<br>northern fire. He who has performed the Darsa and the Paurnamasya rites<br>must make the rectification with the performance of the Ashtakapala rites<br>in honour of the Patikrit fire. If the fire of a lying-in room comes in<br>contact with the perpetual sacred fire, then rectification must be made<br>with the performance of Ashtakapala rites in honour of the Agniman fire.'"
