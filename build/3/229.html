                            "Markandeya continued, 'Those six ladies, the wives of the seven Rishis<br>when they learned that good fortune had smiled on Mahasena and that he<br>had been made leader of the celestial forces,[79] repaired to his camp.<br>Those virtuous ladies of high religious merit had been disowned by the<br>Rishis. They lost no time in visiting that leader of the celestial forces<br>and then addressed him thus, 'We, O son, have been cast out by our<br>god-like husbands, without any cause. Some people spread the rumour that<br>we gave birth to thee. Believing in the truth of this story, they became<br>greatly indignant, and banished us from our sacred places. It behooves<br>thee now to save us from this infamy. We desire to adopt thee as our son,<br>so that, O mighty being, eternal bliss may be secured to us by that<br>favour. Do thou thus repay the obligation thou owest to us.'<br><br>"Skanda replied, 'O ladies of faultless character, do you accordingly<br>become my mothers. I am your son and ye shall attain all the objects of<br>your desire.'<br><br>Markandeya continued, 'Then Sakra having expressed a wish to say<br>something to Skanda, the latter enquired, 'What is it?' Being told by<br>Skanda to speak it out, Vasava said, The lady Abhijit, the younger sister<br>of Rohini, being jealous of her seniority, has repaired to the woods to<br>perform austerities. And I am at a loss to find out a substitute for the<br>fallen star. May good luck attend on thee, do thou consult with Brahma<br>(for the purpose of filling up the room) of this great asterism.<br>Dhanishtha and other asterisms were created by Brahma, and Rohini used to<br>serve the purpose of one such; and consequently their number was full.<br>And in accordance with Sakra's advice, Krittika was assigned a place in<br>the heavens, and that star presided over by Agni shines as if with seven<br>heads. Vinata also said to Skanda, 'Thou art as a son to me, and entitled<br>to offer me the funeral cakes (at my funeral obsequies). I desire, my<br>son, to live with thee always.'<br><br>"Skanda replied, 'Be it so, all honour to thee! Do thou guide me with a<br>mother's affection, and honoured by thy daughter-in-law, thou shalt<br>always live with me.'"<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Then the great mothers spoke as follows to<br>Skanda, 'We have been described by the learned as the mothers of all<br>creatures. But we desire to be thy mothers, do thou honour us.'"<br><br>"Skanda replied, 'Ye are all as mothers to me, and I am your son. Tell me<br>what I can do to please you."'<br><br>"The mothers replied, 'The ladies (Brahmi, Maheswari, &c.) were appointed<br>as mothers of the world in bygone ages. We desire, O great god, that they<br>be dispossessed of that dignity, and ourselves installed in their place,<br>and that we, instead of them, be worshipped by the world. Do thou now<br>restore to us those of our progeny, of whom we have been deprived, by<br>them on thy account.'"<br><br>"Skanda replied, 'Ye shall not recover those that have been once given<br>away, but I can give you other offspring if ye like.'" The mothers<br>replied, 'We desire that living with thee and assuming different shapes<br>we be able to eat up the progeny of those mothers and their guardians. Do<br>thou grant us this favour.'"<br><br>"Skanda said, 'I can grant you progeny, but this topic on which ye have<br>just now dilated is a very painful one. May ye be prosperous! All honour<br>to you, ladies, do ye vouchsafe to them your protecting care.'"<br><br>"The mothers replied, 'We shall protect them, O Skanda, as thou desirest.<br>Mayst thou be prosperous! But, O mighty being, we desire to live with<br>thee always.'"<br><br>"Skanda replied, 'So long as children of the human kind do not attain the<br>youthful state in the sixteenth year of their age, ye shall afflict them<br>with your various forms, and I too shall confer on you a fierce<br>inexhaustible spirit. And with that ye shall live happily, worshipped by<br>all.'"<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'And then a fiery powerful being came out of the<br>body of Skanda for the purpose of devouring the progeny of mortal beings.<br>He fell down upon the ground, senseless and hungry. And bidden by Skanda,<br>that genius of evil assumed a terrific form. Skandapasmara is the name by<br>which it is known among good Brahmanas. Vinata is called the terrific<br>Sakuni graha (spirit of evil). She who is known as Putana Rakshasi by the<br>learned is the graha called Putana; that fierce and terrible looking<br>Rakshasa of a hideous appearance is also called the pisacha, Sita Putana.<br>That fierce-looking spirit is the cause of abortion in women. Aditi is<br>also known by the name of Revati; her evil spirit is called Raivata, and<br>that terrible graha also afflicts children. Diti, the mother of the<br>Daityas (Asuras), is also called Muhkamandika, and that terrible creature<br>is very fond of the flesh of little children. Those male and female<br>children, O Kaurava, who are said to have been begotten by Skanda, are<br>spirit of evil and they destroy the foetus in the womb. They (the<br>Kumaras) are known as the husbands of those very ladies, and children are<br>seized unawares by these cruel spirits. And, O king, Surabhi who is<br>called the mother of bovine kind by the wise is best ridden by the evil<br>spirit Sakuni, who in company with her, devours children on this earth.<br>And Sarama, the mother of dogs, also habitually kills human beings while<br>still in the womb. She who is the mother of all trees has her abode in a<br>karanja tree. She grants boons and has a placid countenance and is always<br>favourably disposed towards all creatures. Those persons who desire to<br>have children, bow down to her, who is seated in a karanja tree. These<br>eighteen evil spirits fond of meat and wine, and others of the same kind,<br>invariably take up their abode in the lying-in-room for ten days. Kadru<br>introduces herself in a subtle form into the body of a pregnant woman and<br>there she causes the destruction of the foetus, and the mother is made to<br>give birth to a Naga (serpent). And that mother of the Gandharvas takes<br>away the foetus, and for this reason, conception in woman turns out to be<br>abortive. The mother of the Apsaras removes the foetus from the womb, and<br>for this reason such conceptions are said to be stationary by the<br>learned. The daughter of the Divinity of the Red Sea is said to have<br>nursed Skanda,&#8212;she is worshipped under the name of Lohitayani on Kadamva<br>trees. Arya acts the same part among female beings, as Rudra does among<br>male ones. She is the mother of all children and is distinctly worshipped<br>for their welfare. These that I have described are the evil spirits<br>presiding over the destinies of young children, and until children attain<br>their sixteenth year, these spirits exercise their influence for evil,<br>and after that, for good. The whole body of male and female spirits that<br>I have now described are always denominated by men as the spirits of<br>Skanda. They are propitiated with burnt offerings, ablutions, unguents,<br>sacrifices and other offerings, and particularly by the worship of<br>Skanda. And, O king, when they are honoured and worshipped with due<br>reverence, they bestow on men whatever is good for them, as also valour<br>and long life. And now having bowed down to Maheswara, I shall describe<br>the nature of those spirits who influence the destinies of men after they<br>have attained their sixteenth year.<br><br>"The man who beholds gods while sleeping, or in a wakeful state soon<br>turns mad, and the spirit under whose influence these hallucinations take<br>place is called the celestial spirit. When a person beholds his dead<br>ancestors while he is seated at ease, or lying in his bed, he soon loses<br>his reason, and the spirit which causes this illusion of sensible<br>perception, is called the ancestral spirit. The man who shows disrespect<br>to the Siddhas and who is cursed by them in return, soon runs mad and the<br>evil influence by which this is brought about, is called the Siddha<br>spirit. And the spirit by whose influence a man smells sweet odour, and<br>becomes cognisant of various tastes (when there are no odoriferous or<br>tasteful substances about him) and soon becomes tormented, is called the<br>Rakshasa spirit. And the spirit by whose action celestial musicians<br>(Gandharvas) blend their existence into the constitution of a human<br>being, and make him run mad in no time, is called the Gandharva spirit.<br>And that evil spirit by whose influence men are always tormented by<br>Pisachas, is called the Paisacha spirit. When the spirit of Yakshas<br>enters into the system of a human being by some accident, he loses his<br>reason immediately, and such a spirit is called the Yaksha spirit. The<br>man who loses his reason on account of his mind being demoralised with<br>vices, runs mad in no time, and his illness must be remedied according to<br>methods prescribed in the Sastras. Men also run mad from perplexity, from<br>fear, as also on beholding hideous sights. The remedy lies in quieting<br>their minds. There are three classes of spirits, some are frolicsome,<br>some are gluttonous, and some sensual. Until men attain the age of three<br>score and ten, these evil influences continue to torment them, and then<br>fever becomes the only evil spirit that afflicts sentient beings. These<br>evil spirits always avoid those who have subdued their senses, who are<br>self-restrained, of cleanly habits, god-fearing and free from laziness<br>and contamination. I have thus described to thee, O king, the evil<br>spirits that mould the destinies of men. Thou who art devoted to<br>Maheswara art never troubled by them."
