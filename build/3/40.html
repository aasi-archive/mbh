                            "Mahadeva said, 'Thou wert in thy former life Nara, the friend of<br>Narayana. In Vadari wert thou engaged in fierce ascetic austerities for<br>several thousands of years. In thee as well as in Vishnu&#8212;that first of<br>male beings&#8212;dwelleth great might. Ye both, by your might, hold the<br>universe; O lord, taking up that fierce bow whose twang resembled the<br>deep roar of the clouds, thou, as well as Krishna, chastisedest the<br>Danavas during the coronation of Indra. Even this Gandiva is that bow, O<br>son of Pritha, fit for thy hands. O foremost of male beings, I snatched<br>it from thee, helped by my powers of illusion. This couple of quivers,<br>fit for thee, will again be inexhaustible, O son of Pritha! And, O son of<br>the Kuru race, thy body will be free from pain and disease. Thy prowess<br>is incapable of being baffled. I have been pleased with thee. And, O<br>first of male beings, ask thou of me the boon that thou desirest. O<br>chastiser of all foes, O giver of proper respect, (to those deserving it)<br>not even in heaven is there any male being who is equal to thee, nor any<br>Kshatriya who is thy superior.'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'O illustrious god having the bull for thy sign, if thou<br>wilt grant me my desire, I ask of thee, O lord that fierce celestial<br>weapon wielded by thee and called Brahmasira&#8212;that weapon of terrific<br>prowess which destroyeth, at the end of the Yuga the entire<br>universe&#8212;that weapon by the help of which, O god of gods, I may under<br>thy grace, obtain victory in the terrible conflict which shall take place<br>between myself (on one side), and Karna and Bhishma and Kripa and Drona<br>(on the other)&#8212;that weapon by which I may consume in battle Danavas and<br>Rakshasas and evil spirits and Pisachas and Gandharvas and Nagas&#8212;that<br>weapon which when hurled with Mantras produceth darts by thousands and<br>fierce-looking maces and arrows like snakes of virulent poison, and by<br>means of which I may fight with Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and Karna of<br>ever abusive tongue, O illustrious destroyer of the eyes of Bhaga, even<br>this is my foremost desire, viz., that I may be able to fight with them<br>and obtain success.'<br><br>Bhava replied, 'O powerful one. I will give to thee that favourite weapon<br>of mine called the Pasuputa. O son of Pandu, thou art capable of holding,<br>hurling, and withdrawing it. Neither the chief himself of the gods, nor<br>Yama, nor the king of the Yakshas, nor Varuna, nor Vayu, knoweth it. How<br>could men know anything of it? But, O son of Pritha, this weapon should<br>not be hurled without adequate cause; for if hurled at any foe of little<br>might it may destroy the whole universe. In the three worlds with all<br>their mobile and immobile creatures, there is none who is incapable of<br>being slain by this weapon. And it may be hurled by the mind, by the eye,<br>by words, and by the bow.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Hearing these words, the son of Pritha purified<br>himself. And approaching the lord of the universe with rapt attention, he<br>said, 'Instruct me!' Mahadeva then imparted unto that best of Pandu's son<br>the knowledge of that weapon looking like the embodiment of Yama,<br>together with all the mysteries about hurling and withdrawing it. And<br>that weapon thence began to wait upon Arjuna as it did upon Sankara, the<br>lord of Uma. And Arjuna also gladly accepted it. And at the moment the<br>whole earth, with its mountains and woods and trees and seas and forests<br>and villages and towns and mines, trembled. And the sounds of conchs and<br>drums and trumpets by thousands began to be heard. And at that moment<br>hurricanes and whirlwinds began to blow. And the gods and the Danavas<br>beheld that terrible weapon in its embodied form stay by the side of<br>Arjuna of immeasurable energy. And whatever of evil there had been in the<br>body of Phalguna of immeasurable energy was all dispelled by the touch of<br>the three-eyed deity. And the three eyed god then commanded Arjuna,<br>saying, 'Go thou into heaven.' Arjuna then, O king, worshipping the god<br>with bent head, gazed at him, with joined hands. Then the lord of all the<br>dwellers of heaven, the deity of blazing splendour having his abode on<br>mountain-breasts, the husband of Uma, the god of passions under complete<br>control, the source of all blessings, Bhava gave unto Arjuna, that<br>foremost of men, the great bow called Gandiva, destructive of Danavas and<br>Pisachas. And the god of gods, then leaving that blessed mountain with<br>snowy plateaus and vales and caves, favourite resort of sky-ranging great<br>Rishis, went up, accompanied by Uma into the skies, in the sight of that<br>foremost of men."
