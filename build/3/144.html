                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O Bhima, let this mighty and heroic Rakshasa chief,<br>thy legitimate son, devoted to us, and truthful, and conversant with<br>virtue carry (his) mother (Draupadi) without delay. And, O possessor of<br>dreadful prowess, depending on the strength of thy arms, I shall reach<br>the Gandhamadana, unhurt, together with Panchala's daughter.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Hearing the words of his brother, that tiger among<br>men, Bhimasena, commanded his son, Ghatotkacha, represser of foes,<br>saying, 'O invincible son of Hidimva, this thy mother hath been sorely<br>tired. Thou art, again, strong and capable of going wherever thou likest.<br>Do thou therefore, O ranger of the skies, carry her. May prosperity<br>attend thee! Taking her on thy shoulders, thou shalt go in our company,<br>adopting a course not far overhead,&#8212;so that thou mayst not render her<br>uneasy.' Thereat, Ghatotkacha said, 'Even single-handed, I am able to<br>carry Yudhishthira the just, and Dhaumya, and Krishna, and the twins&#8212;and<br>what wonder then that I shall to-day carry them, when I have others to<br>assist me? And, O sinless one, hundreds of other heroic (Rakshasas),<br>capable of moving through the sky, and of assuming any shape at will,<br>will together carry you all with the Brahmanas."<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Saying this, Ghatotkacha carried Krishna in the midst<br>of the Pandavas, and the other (Rakshasas) also began to carry the<br>Pandavas. And by virtue of his native energy, Lomasa of incomparable<br>effulgence moved along the path of the Siddhas, like unto a second sun.<br>And at the command of the lord of the Rakshasas, those Rakshasas of<br>terrific prowess began to proceed, bearing all the other Brahmanas, and<br>beholding many a romantic wood. And they proceeded towards the gigantic<br>jujube tree. And carried by the Rakshasas of great speed, proceeding at a<br>rapid pace, the heroes passed over longextending ways quickly, as if over<br>short ones. And on their way they saw various tracts crowded with<br>Mlechchha people, and containing mines of diverse gems. And they also saw<br>hillocks teeming with various minerals, thronged with Vidyadharas,<br>inhabited on all sides by monkeys and Kinnaras and Kimpurushas, and<br>Gandharvas, and filled with peacocks, and chamaras, and apes, and rurus,<br>and bears, and gavayas, and buffaloes, intersected with a network of<br>rivulets, and inhabited by various birds and beasts, and beautified by<br>elephants, and abounding in trees and enraptured birds. After having thus<br>passed many countries, and also the Uttarakurus, they saw that foremost<br>of mountains, the Kailasa, containing many wonders. And by the side of<br>it, they beheld the hermitage of Nara and Narayana, with celestial trees<br>bearing flowers and fruits in all seasons. And they also beheld that<br>beautiful jujube of round trunk. And it was fresh; and of deep shade; and<br>of excellent beauty; and of thick, soft and sleek foliage; and healthful;<br>and having gigantic boughs; and wide-spreading; and of incomparable<br>lustre; and bearing full-grown, tasteful, and holy fruits dropping honey.<br>And this celestial tree was frequented by hosts of mighty sages, and was<br>always inhabited by various birds maddened with animal spirits. And it<br>grew at a spot devoid of mosquitoes and gad-flies, and abounding in<br>fruits and roots and water, and covered with green grass, and inhabited<br>by the celestials and the Gandharvas, and of smooth surface, and<br>naturally healthful, and beauteous and cool and of delicate feel. Having<br>reached that (tree) together with those bulls among Brahmanas, the<br>high-souled ones gently alighted from the shoulders of the Rakshasas.<br>Then in company with those bulls among the twice-born ones, the Pandavas<br>beheld that romantic asylum presided over by Nara and Narayana; devoid of<br>gloom; and sacred; and untouched by the solar rays; and free from those<br>rubs, viz. hunger, and thirst, heat and cold, and removing (all) sorrow;<br>and crowded with hosts of mighty sages; and adorned with the grace<br>proceeding from the Vedas, Saman, Rich, and Yajus; and, O king,<br>inaccessible to men who have renounced religion; and beautified with<br>offerings, and homas; and sacred; and well-swept and daubed; and shining<br>all around with offerings of celestial blossoms; and spread over with<br>altars of sacrificial fire, and sacred ladles and pots; and graced with<br>large water-jars, and baskets and the refuge of all beings; and echoing<br>with the chanting of the Vedas; and heavenly: and worthy of being<br>inhabited; and removing fatigue; and attended with splendour and of<br>incomprehensible merit; and majestic with divine qualities. And the<br>hermitage was inhabited by hosts of great sages, subsisting on fruits and<br>roots; and having their senses under perfect control; and clad in black<br>deer-skins; and effulgent like unto the Sun and Agni; and of souls<br>magnified by asceticism and intent on emancipation; and leading the<br>Vanaprastha mode of life; and of subdued senses; and identified with the<br>Supreme Soul; and of high fortune; and reciting Vaidic hymns. Then having<br>purified himself and restrained his senses, that son of Dharma, the<br>intelligent Yudhishthira of exceeding energy, accompanied by his<br>brothers, approached those sages. And all the great sages endued with<br>supernatural knowledge, knowing Yudhishthira arrived, received him<br>joyfully. And those sages engaged in the recitation of the Vedas, and<br>like unto fire itself, after having conferred blessings on Yudhishthira,<br>cheerfully accorded him fitting reception. And they gave him clean water<br>and flowers and roots. And Yudhishthira the just received with regard the<br>things gladly offered for his reception by the great sages. And then, O<br>sinless one, Pandu's son together with Krishna and his brothers, and<br>thousands of Brahmanas versed in the Vedas and the Vendangas, entered<br>into that holy hermitage, like unto the abode of Sukra and pleasing the<br>mind with heavenly odours and resembling heaven itself and attended with<br>beauty. There the pious (Yudhishthira) beheld the hermitage of Nara and<br>Narayana, beautified by the Bhagirathi and worshipped by the gods and the<br>celestial sages. And seeing that hermitage inhabited by the Brahmarshis<br>and containing fruits dropping honey, the Pandavas were filled with<br>delight. And having reached that place, the high-souled ones began to<br>dwell with the Brahmanas. There beholding the holy lake Vinda, and the<br>mountain Mainaka, of golden summits and inhabited by various species of<br>birds, the magnanimous ones lived happily with joy. The son of Pandu<br>together with Krishna took pleasure in ranging excellent and captivating<br>woods, shining with flowers of every season; beauteous on all sides with<br>trees bearing blown blossoms; and bending down with the weight of fruits<br>and attended by the numerous male kokilas and of glossy foliage; and<br>thick and having cool shade and lovely to behold. They took delight in<br>beholding diverse beautiful lakes of limpid water and shining all round<br>with lotuses and lilies. And there, O lord, the balmy breeze bearing pure<br>fragrance, blew gladdening all the Pandavas, together with Krishna. And<br>hard by the gigantic jujube, the mighty son of Kunti saw the Bhagirathi<br>of easy descent and cool and furnished with fresh lotuses and having<br>stairs made of rubies and corals and graced with trees and scattered over<br>with celestial flowers, and gladsome to the mind. And at that spot,<br>frequented by celestials and sages, and extremely inaccessible, they,<br>after having purified themselves offered oblations unto the pitris and<br>the gods and the rishis in the sacred waters of the Bhagirathi. Thus<br>those bulls among men the heroic perpetuators of the Kuru race, began to<br>reside there with the Brahmanas offering oblations and practising<br>meditation. And those tigers among men, the Pandavas of the god-like<br>appearance, felt delight in witnessing the various amusements of<br>Draupadi."
