                            Vaisampayana said, "Hearing those words of Bhima, Yudhishthira. the son<br>of Kunti&#8212;tiger among men and slayer of all foes&#8212;began to sigh heavily,<br>and reflect in silence. And he thought within himself, 'I have heard<br>recited the duties of kings, also all truths about the duties of the<br>different orders. He is said to observe those duties truly who keepeth<br>them before his eyes, so as to regulate his conduct both in the present<br>and the future. Knowing as I do the true course of virtue, which, however<br>is so very difficult of being known, how can I forcibly grind virtue down<br>like grinding the mountains of Meru? Having reflected so for a moment,<br>and settled what he should do, he replied unto Bhima as follows without<br>allowing him another word:<br><br>"O thou of mighty arms, it is even so as thou hast said. But, O thou<br>foremost of speakers, listen now to another word I say. Whatever sinful<br>deeds, O Bhima, one seeketh to achieve, depending on his courage alone,<br>become always a source of pain. But, O thou of mighty arms, whatever is<br>begun with deliberation, with well-directed prowess, with all appliances,<br>and much previous thought, is seen to succeed. The gods themselves favour<br>such designs. Hear from me something about what, proud of thy might, O<br>Bhima, and led away by thy restlessness, thou thinkest should be<br>immediately begun. Bhurisravas, Sala, the mighty Jarasandha, Bhishma,<br>Drona, Karna, the mighty son of Drona, Dhritarashtra's sons&#8212;Duryodhana<br>and others&#8212;so difficult of being vanquished, are all accomplished in<br>arms and ever ready for battle with us. Those kings and chiefs of the<br>earth also who have been injured by us, have all adopted the side of the<br>Kauravas, and are bound by ties of affection to them. O Bharata, they are<br>engaged in seeking the good of Duryodhana and not of us. With full<br>treasures and aided by large forces, they will certainly strive their<br>best in battle. All the officers also of the Kuru army together with<br>their sons and relatives, have been honoured by Duryodhana with wealth<br>and luxuries. Those heroes are also much regarded by Duryodhana. This is<br>my certain conclusion that they will sacrifice their lives for Duryodhana<br>in battle. Although the behaviour of Bhishma, Drona, and the illustrious<br>Kripa, is the same towards us as towards them, yet, O thou of mighty<br>arms, this is my certain conclusion that in order to pay off the royal<br>favours they enjoy, they will throw their very lives, than which there is<br>nothing dearer, in battle. All of them are masters of celestial weapons,<br>and devoted to the practice of virtue. I think they are incapable of<br>being vanquished even by gods led by Vasava himself. There is again<br>amongst them that mighty warrior&#8212;Karna&#8212;impetuous, and ever wrathful,<br>master of all weapons, and invincible, and encased in impenetrable mail.<br>Without first vanquishing in battle all those foremost of men, unaided as<br>thou art, how canst thou slay Duryodhana? O Vrikodara, I cannot sleep<br>thinking of the lightness of hand of that Suta's son, who, I regard, is<br>the foremost of all wielders of the bow!"<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, "Hearing these words of Yudhishthira, the<br>impetuous Bhima became alarmed, and forbore from speaking anything. And<br>while the sons of Pandu were thus conversing with each other, there came<br>to that spot the great ascetic Vyasa, the son of Satyavati. And as he<br>came, the sons of Pandu worshipped him duly. Then that foremost of all<br>speakers, addressing Yudhishthira, said, O, Yudhishthira, O thou of<br>mighty arms, knowing by spiritual insight what is passing in thy heart, I<br>have come to thee, O thou bull among men! The fear that is in thy heart,<br>arising from Bhishma, and Drona, and Kripa, and Karna, and Drona's son,<br>and prince Duryodhana, and Dussasana, I will dispell, O slayer of all<br>foes, by means of an act enjoined by the ordinance. Hearing it from me,<br>accomplish it thou with patience, and having accomplished it, O king,<br>quell this fever of thine soon.'"<br><br>That foremost of speakers then, the son of Parasara, taking Yudhishthira<br>to a corner, began to address him in words of deep import, saying, 'O<br>best of the Bharatas, the time is come for thy prosperity, when, indeed<br>Dhananjaya&#8212;that son of Pritha&#8212;will slay all thy foes in battle. Uttered<br>by me and like unto success personified, accept from me this knowledge<br>called Pratismriti that I impart to thee, knowing thou art capable of<br>receiving it. Receiving it (from thee), Arjuna will be able to accomplish<br>his desire. And let Arjuna, O son of Pandu, go unto Mahendra and Rudra,<br>and Varuna, and Kuvera, and Yama, for receiving weapon from them. He is<br>competent to behold the gods for his asceticism and prowess. He is even a<br>Rishi of great energy, the friend of Narayana; ancient, eternal a god<br>himself, invincible, ever successful, and knowing no deterioration. Of<br>mighty arms, he will achieve mighty deeds, having obtained weapons from<br>Indra, and Rudra, and the Lokapalas, O son of Kunti, think also of going<br>from this to some other forest that may, O king, be fit for thy abode. To<br>reside in one place for any length of time is scarcely pleasant. In thy<br>case, it might also be productive of anxiety to the ascetics. And as thou<br>maintainest numerous Brahmanas versed in the Vedas and the several<br>branches thereof, continued residence here might exhaust the deer of this<br>forest, and be destructive of the creepers and plants.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having addressed him thus, that illustrious and<br>exalted ascetic Vyasa, of great wisdom, acquired with the mysteries of<br>the world, then imparted unto the willing Yudhishthira the just, who had<br>meanwhile purified himself, that foremost of sciences. And bidding<br>farewell unto the son of Kunti, Vyasa disappeared then and there. The<br>virtuous and intelligent Yudhishthira, however, having obtained that<br>knowledge carefully retained it in his mind and always recited it on<br>proper occasions. Glad of the advice given him by Vyasa, the son of Kunti<br>then, leaving the wood Dwaitavana went to the forest of Kamyaka on the<br>banks of the Saraswati. And, O king, numerous Brahmanas of ascetic merit<br>and versed in the science of orthoepy and orthography, followed him like<br>the Rishis following the chief of the celestials. Arrived at Kamyaka,<br>those illustrious bulls amongst the Bharata took up their residence there<br>along with their friends and attendants. And possessed of energy, those<br>heroes, O king, lived there for some time, devoted to the exercise of the<br>bow and hearing all the while the chanting of the Vedas. And they went<br>about those woods every day in search of deer, armed with pure arrows.<br>And they duly performed all the rites in honour of the Pitris, the<br>celestials and the Brahmanas."
