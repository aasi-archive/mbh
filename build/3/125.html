                            "Lomasa said, 'When the god who had performed a hundred sacrifices<br>(Indra) beheld the demon Mada of a frightful mien, coming towards him<br>with open mouth, his intention being to devour him, and looking like the<br>god of death himself, while his own arms remained paralysed, he through<br>fear repeatedly licked the corners of his mouth. Then the lord of the<br>celestials, tortured with fright, spake to Chyavana saying, 'O Bhrigu's<br>son! O Brahmana! verily I tell thee as truth itself, that from this day<br>forward the two Aswins will be entitled to the Soma juice. Be merciful to<br>me! My undertaking can never come to naught. Let this be the rule. And I<br>know, O saint of the sacerdotal caste! that thy work can never come to<br>nothing. These two Aswins will have a right to drink the Soma juice,<br>since thou hast made them entitled to the same. And, O Bhrigu's son, I<br>have done this but to spread the fame of thy powers, and my object was to<br>give thee an occasion for displaying thy powers. My other object was that<br>the fame of the father of this Sukanya here might spread everywhere.<br>Therefore be merciful to me: let it be as thou wishest.' Being thus<br>addressed by Indra, the wrath of Chyavana of mighty soul was quickly<br>appeased, and he set free the demolisher of hostile cities (Indra). And<br>the powerful saint, O king! distributed Mada (literally intoxication),<br>and put it piece-meal in drinks, in women, in gambling, and in field<br>sports, even this same Mada who had been created repeatedly before.<br>Having thus cast down the demon Mada and gratified Indra with a Soma<br>draught and assisted king Saryati in worshipping all the gods together<br>with the two Aswins and also spread his fame for power over all the<br>worlds, the best of those endued with speech passed his days happily in<br>the wood, in the company of Sukanya, his loving wife. This is his lake,<br>shining, O king! and resounding with the voice of birds. Here must thou,<br>together with thy uterine brothers, offer libations of water to thy<br>forefathers and the gods. And, O ruler of earth! O scion of Bharata's<br>race! having visited it and Sikataksha also, thou shalt repair to the<br>Saindhava wood, and behold a number of small artificial rivers. And O<br>great king, O scion of Bharata's race! thou shalt touch the waters of all<br>the holy lakes and reciting the hymns of the god Sthanu (Siva), meet with<br>success in every undertaking. For this is the junction, O most<br>praiseworthy of men, of the two ages of the world, viz., Dwapara and<br>Treta. It is a time, O Kunti's son! capable of destroying all the sins of<br>a person. Here do thou perform ablutions, for the spot is able to remove<br>all the sins of an individual. Yonder is the Archika hill, a dwelling<br>place for men of cultured minds. Fruits of all the seasons grow here at<br>all times and the streams run for ever. It is an excellent place fit for<br>the celestials. And there are the holy cairns of diverse forms, set up by<br>the celestials. O Yudhishthira! this is the bathing spot belonging to the<br>Moon. And the saints are in attendance here on all sides round&#8212;they are<br>the dwellers of the wood and the Valakhilyas, and the Pavakas, who<br>subsist on air only. These are three peaks and three springs. Thou mayst<br>walk round them all, one by one: then thou mayst wash thyself at<br>pleasure. Santanu, O king! and Sunaka the sovereign of men, and both Nara<br>and Narayana have attained everlasting regions from this place. Here did<br>the gods constantly lie down, as also the forefathers, together with the<br>mighty saints. In this Archika hill, they all carried on austerities.<br>Sacrifice to them, O Yudhishthira! Here did they, also the saints, eat<br>rice cooked in milk, O protector of men! And here is the Yamuna of an<br>exhaustless spring. Krishna here engaged himself in a life of penances, O<br>Pandu's son. O thou that draggest the dead bodies of thy foes! the twin<br>brothers, and Bhimasena and Krishna and all of us will accompany thee to<br>this spot. O lord of men, this is the holy spring that belongeth to<br>Indra. Here the creative and the dispensing deity, and Varuna also rose<br>upwards, and here too they dwelt, O king! observing forbearance, and<br>possessed of the highest faith. This excellent and propitious hill is fit<br>for persons of a kindly and candid disposition. This is that celebrated<br>Yamuna, O king! frequented by hosts of mighty saints, the scene of<br>diverse religious rites, holy, and destructive of the dread of sin. Here<br>did Mandhata himself, of a mighty bow, perform sacrificial rites for the<br>gods; and so did Somaka, O Kunti's son! who was the son of Sahadeva, and<br>a most excellent maker of gifts.
