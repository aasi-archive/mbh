                            "Vrihadaswa said, 'O monarch, having deserted Damayanti, king Nala saw a<br>mighty conflagration that was raging in that dense forest. And in the<br>midst of that conflagration, he heard the voice of some creature,<br>repeatedly crying aloud, 'O righteous Nala, come hither.' And answering,<br>'Fear not,' he entered into the midst of the fire and beheld a mighty<br>Naga lying in coils. And the Naga with joined hands, and trembling, spake<br>unto Nala, saying, 'O king, that I am a snake, Karkotaka by name. I had<br>deceived the great Rishi Narada of high ascetic merit, and by him have I<br>been cursed in wrath, O king of men, even in words such as these: 'Stay<br>thou here like an immobile thing, until one Nala taketh thee hence. And,<br>indeed, on the spot to which he will carry thee, there shalt thou he<br>freed from my curse. It is for that curse of his that I am unable to stir<br>one step. I will instruct thee in respect of thy welfare. It behoveth<br>thee to deliver me. I will be thy friend. There is no snake equal to me.<br>I will be light in thy hands. Taking me up, do thou speedily go hence.'<br>Having said this, that prince of snakes became as small as the thumb. And<br>taking him up, Nala went to a spot free from fire. Having reached an open<br>spot where there was no fire, Nala intended to drop the serpent, upon<br>which Karkotaka again addressed him, saying, 'O king of the Nishadhas,<br>proceed thou yet, counting a few steps of thine; meanwhile, O<br>mighty-armed one, I will do thee great good.' And as Nala began to count<br>his steps, the snake bit him at the tenth step. And, lo! As he was bit,<br>his form speedily underwent a change. And beholding his change of form,<br>Nala was amazed. And the king saw the snake also assume his own form. And<br>the snake Karkotaka, comforting Nala, spake unto him, 'I have deprived<br>thee of thy beauty, so that people may not recognise thee. And, O Nala,<br>he by whom thou hast been deceived and cast into distress, shall dwell in<br>thee tortured by my venom. And, O monarch, as long as he doth not leave<br>thee, he will have to dwell in pain in thy body with thee every limb<br>filled with my venom. And, O ruler of men I have saved from the hands of<br>him who from anger and hate deceived thee, perfectly innocent though thou<br>art and undeserving of wrong. And, O tiger among men, through my grace,<br>thou shalt have (no longer) any fear from animals with fangs from<br>enemies, and from Brahmanas also versed in the Vedas, O king! Nor shalt<br>thou, O monarch, feel pain on account of my poison. And, O foremost of<br>kings, thou shalt be ever victorious in battle. This very day, O prince,<br>O lord of Nishadhas, go to the delightful city of Ayodhya, and present<br>thyself before Rituparna skilled in gambling, saying, 'I am a charioteer,<br>Vahuka by name.' And that king will give thee his skill in dice for thy<br>knowledge of horses. Sprung from the line of Ikswaku, and possessed of<br>prosperity, he will be thy friend. When thou wilt be an adept at dice,<br>thou shalt then have prosperity. Thou wilt also meet with thy wife and<br>thy children, and regain thy kingdom. I tell thee this truly. Therefore,<br>let not thy mind be occupied by sorrow. And, O lord of men, when thou<br>shouldst desire to behold thy proper form, thou shouldst remember me, and<br>wear this garment. Upon wearing this, thou shalt get back thy own form.'<br>And saying this, that Naga then gave unto Nala two pieces of celestial<br>cloth. And, O son of the Kuru race, having thus instructed Nala, and<br>presented him with the attire, the king of snakes, O monarch, made<br>himself invisible there and then!'"
