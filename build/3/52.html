                            (Nalopakhyana Parva)<br><br>Janamejaya said, "When the high-souled Partha went to Indra's region for<br>obtaining weapons, what did Yudhishthira and the other sons of Pandu do?"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "When the high-souled Partha went to Indra's region<br>for obtaining weapons, those bulls of the Bharata race continued to dwell<br>with Krishna in (the woods of) Kamyaka. One day, those foremost of the<br>Bharatas, afflicted with grief, were seated with Krishna on a clean and<br>solitary sward. Grieving for Dhananjaya, overwhelmed with sorrow, their<br>voices were choked with weeping. Tortured by Dhananjaya's absence, grief<br>afflicted them equally. And filled with sorrow at their separation from<br>Arjuna and at the loss of their kingdom, the mighty-armed Bhima among<br>them addressed Yudhishthira, saying, "That Bull of the Bharata race,<br>Arjuna, O great king, on whom depend the lives of Pandu's sons, and on<br>whose death the Panchalas as also ourselves with our sons and Satyaki and<br>Vasudeva are sure to die, hath gone away at thy behest. What can be<br>sadder than this that the virtuous Vibhatsu hath gone away at thy<br>command, thinking of his many griefs? Depending upon the might of that<br>illustrious hero's arms, regard our foes as already vanquished in battle,<br>and the whole earth itself as already acquired by us. It was for the sake<br>of that mighty warrior that I refrained from sending to the other world<br>all the Dhartarashtras along with the Suvalas, in the midst of the<br>assembly. Gifted with might of arms, and supported by Vasudeva, we have<br>to suppress the wrath that hath been roused in us, because thou art the<br>root of that wrath. Indeed, with Krishna's help, slaying our foes headed<br>by Karna, we are able to rule the entire earth (thus) conquered by our<br>own arms. Endued with manliness, we are yet overwhelmed with calamities,<br>in consequence of thy gambling vice, while the foolish null of<br>Dhritarashtra are growing stronger with the tributes (gathered from<br>dependent kings). O mighty monarch, it behoveth thee to keep in view the<br>duties of the Kshatriya. O great king, it is not the duty of a Khsatriya<br>to live in the woods. The wise are of the opinion that to rule is the<br>foremost duty of a Kshatriya. O king, thou art conversant with Kshatriya<br>morality. Do not, therefore, deviate from the path of duty. Turning away<br>from the woods, let us, summoning Partha and Janardana, slay, O king, the<br>sons of Dhritarashtra, even before the twelve years are complete. O<br>illustrious monarch O king of kings, even if these Dhartarashtras be<br>surrounded by soldiers in array of battle, I shall send them to the other<br>world by dint of might alone. I shall slay all the sons of Dhritarashtra<br>along with the Sauvalas, indeed, Duryodhana, Karna, and any one else that<br>will fight with me. And after I shall have slain all our foes, thou mayst<br>come back unto the woods. By acting thus, O king, no fault will be thine.<br>(Or if any sin be thine), O represser of foes, O mighty monarch, washing<br>it off, O sire, by various sacrifices, we may ascend to a superior<br>heaven. Such a consummation may come to pass, if our king proveth not<br>unwise or procrastinating. Thou art, however, virtuous. Verily the<br>deceitful should be destroyed by deceit. To slay the deceitful by deceit,<br>is not regarded as sinful. O Bharata, it is, also said by those versed in<br>morality that one day and night is, O great prince, equal unto a full<br>year. The Veda text also, exalted one, is often heard, signifying that a<br>year is equivalent to a day when passed in the observance of certain<br>difficult vows. O thou of unfading glory, if the Vedas are an authority<br>with thee, regard thou the period of a day and something more as the<br>equivalent of thirteen years. O represser of foes, this is the time to<br>slay Duryodhana with his adherents. Else, O king, he will beforehand<br>bring the whole earth obedient to his will. O foremost of monarchs, all<br>this is the result of thy addiction to gambling. We are on the verge of<br>destruction already, in consequence of thy promise of living one year<br>undiscovered. I do not find the country where, if we live, the<br>wicked-minded Suyodhana may not be able to trace us by his spies. And<br>finding us out, that wretch will again deceitfully send us into such<br>exile in the woods. Or if that sinful one beholdeth us emerge, after the<br>expiry of the pledged period of non-discovery, he will again invite thee,<br>O great king, to dice, and the play will once more begin. Summoned once<br>more, thou wilt again efface thyself at dice. Thou art not skilled at<br>dice, and when summoned at play, thou wilt be deprived of thy senses.<br>Therefore, O mighty monarch thou wilt have to lead a life in the woods<br>again. If, O mighty king, it behoveth thee not to make us wretched for<br>life, observe thou fully the ordinance of the Vedas, (which inculcateth<br>that) verily the deceitful ought to be slain by deceit. If I but have thy<br>command I would go (to Hastinapura) and, even as fire falling upon a heap<br>of grass consumeth it, would slay Duryodhana, putting forth my utmost<br>might. It behoveth thee, therefore, to grant me the permission.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed by Bhima, king Yudhishthira the<br>just, smelt the crown of that son of Pandu, and pacifying him said, 'O<br>mighty-armed one, without doubt, thou wilt, assisted by the wielder of<br>the Gandiva, slay Suyodhana at the expiry of the thirteenth year. But, O<br>son of Pritha, as for thy assertion, 'O Lord, the time is complete', I<br>cannot dare tell an untruth, for untruth is not in me. O son of Kunti,<br>without the help of fraud, wilt thou kill the wicked and irrepressible<br>Duryodhana, with his allies.'<br><br>"While Yudhishthira the just, was speaking unto Bhima thus, there came<br>the great and illustrious Rishi Vrihadaswa before them. And beholding<br>that virtuous ascetic before him, the righteous king worshipped him<br>according to the ordinance, with the offering of Madhuparka. And when the<br>ascetic was seated and refreshed, the mighty-armed Yudhishthira sat by<br>him, and looking up at the former, addressed him thus in exceedingly<br>piteous accents:<br><br>'O holy one, summoned by cunning gamblers skilled at dice, I have been<br>deprived of wealth and kingdom through gambling. I am not an adept at<br>dice, and am unacquainted with deceit. Sinful men, by unfair means,<br>vanquished me at play. They even brought into the public assembly my wife<br>dearer unto me than life itself. And defeating me a second time, they<br>have sent me to distressful exile in this great forest, clad in deer<br>skins. At present I am leading a distressful life in the woods in grief<br>of heart. Those harsh and cruel speeches they addressed me on the<br>occasion of that gambling match, and the words of my afflicted friends<br>relating to the match at dice and other subjects, are all stored up in my<br>remembrance. Recollecting them I pass the whole night in (sleepless)<br>anxiety. Deprived also (of the company) of the illustrious wielder of the<br>Gandiva, on whom depend the lives of us all, I am almost deprived of<br>life. Oh, when shall I see the sweet-speeched and large-hearted Vibhatsu<br>so full of kindness and activity, return to us, having obtained all<br>weapons? Is there a king on this earth who is more unfortunate than<br>myself? Hast thou ever seen or heard of any such before? To my thinking,<br>there is no man more wretched than I am.'<br><br>"Vrihadaswa said, 'O great king, O son of Pandu, thou sayest, 'There is<br>no person more miserable than I am' O sinless monarch, if thou wilt<br>listen, I will relate unto thee the history of a king more wretched than<br>thyself?<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "And thereupon the king said unto the ascetic, 'O<br>illustrious one, tell me, I desire to hear the history of the king who<br>had fallen into such a condition.'<br><br>"Vrihadaswa said, 'O king, O thou that never fallest off, listen<br>attentively with thy brothers, I will narrate the history of a prince<br>more miserable than thyself. There was a celebrated king among the<br>Nishadhas, named Virasena. He had a son named Nala, versed in (the<br>knowledge of) virtue and wealth. It hath been heard by us that, that king<br>was deceitfully defeated by Pushkara, and afflicted with calamity, he<br>dwelt in the woods with his spouse. And, O king, while he was living in<br>the forest, he had neither slaves nor cars, neither brother nor friends<br>with him. But thou art surrounded by thy heroic brothers like unto the<br>celestials, and also by foremost regenerate ones like unto Brahma<br>himself. Therefore, it behoveth thee not to grieve.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'I am anxious to hear in detail, O thou foremost of<br>eloquent men, the history of the illustrious Nala. It behoveth thee<br>therefore to relate it unto me.'
