                            "Lomasa said, 'O most righteous of kings! When he heard these words<br>(proceeding) from the sky, he had faith therein, and did all that he was<br>directed to do, O chief of the men of Bharata's race! Then the ruler of<br>men took separately each of the seeds and then placed these divisions (of<br>the gourd) in vessels filled with clarified butter. And intent on the<br>preservation of his sons, he provided a nurse for every (receptacle).<br>Then after a long time there arose sixty thousand exceedingly powerful<br>sons of that same king&#8212;gifted with unmeasured strength, they were born,<br>O ruler of earth! to that saint-like king, by Rudra's favour. And they<br>were terrible; and their acts were ruthless. And they were able to ascend<br>and roam about in the sky; and being numerous themselves, despised<br>everybody, including the gods. And they would chase even the gods, the<br>Gandharvas, and the Rakshasas and all the born beings, being themselves<br>valiant and addicted to fighting. Then all people, harassed by the<br>dull-headed sons of Sagara, united with all the gods, went to Brahma as<br>their refuge. And then addressed the blessed grandfather of all beings<br>(Brahma), 'Go ye your way, ye gods, together with all these men. In a not<br>very long space of time, there will come about, O gods! a great and<br>exceedingly terrible destruction of Sagara's sons, caused by the deed<br>perpetrated by them.' Thus addressed, those same gods, and men, O lord of<br>the sons of Manu! bade adieu to the grandfather, and went back to whence<br>they had come. Then, O chief of Bharata's race! after the expiry of very<br>many days, the mighty king Sagara accepted the consecration for<br>performing the rites of a horse-sacrifice. And his horse began to roam<br>over the world, protected by his sons. And when the horse reached the<br>sea, waterless and frightful to behold&#8212;although the horse was guarded<br>with very great care&#8212;it (suddenly) vanished at the very spot (it stood<br>upon). Then, O respected sir! those same sons of Sagara imagined the same<br>fine horse to have been stolen; and returning to their father, narrated<br>how it had been stolen out of sight. And thereupon he addressed them,<br>saying, 'Go ye and search for the horse in all the cardinal points.'<br>Then, O great king! by this command of their father, they began to search<br>for the horse in the cardinal points and throughout the whole surface of<br>the earth. But all those sons of Sagara, all mutually united, could not<br>find the horse, nor the person who had stolen it. And coming back then,<br>they with joined palms (thus addressed) their father, (standing) before<br>them, 'O Protector of men! O ruler of the earth! O king! by thy command,<br>the whole of this world with its hills and its forest tracts, with its<br>seas, and its woods, and its islands, with its rivulets and rivers and<br>caves, hath been searched through by us. But we cannot find either the<br>horse, or the thief who had stolen the same.' And hearing the words, the<br>same king became senseless with wrath, and then told them all, carried<br>away by Destiny, 'Go ye all, may ye never return! Search ye again for the<br>horse. Without that sacrificial horse, ye must never return, my boys!'"<br><br>"And those same sons of Sagara, accepted this command of their father,<br>and once more began to search through the entire world. Now these heroes<br>saw a rift on the surface of the earth. And having reached this pit, the<br>sons of Sagara began to excavate it. And with spades and pickaxes they<br>went on digging the sea, making the utmost efforts. And that same abode<br>of Varuna (namely the ocean), being thus, excavated by the united sons of<br>Sagara and rent and cut on all sides round, was placed in a condition of<br>the utmost distress. And the demons and snakes and Rakshasas and various<br>(other) animated beings began to utter distressful cries, while being<br>killed by Sagara's sons. And hundreds and thousands of animated beings<br>were beheld with severed heads and separated trunks and with their skins<br>and bones and joints rent asunder and broken. Thus they went on digging<br>the ocean, which was the abode of Varuna and an exceedingly long space of<br>time expired in this work, but still the horse was not found. Then, O<br>lord of earth! towards the north-eastern region of the sea, the incensed<br>sons of Sagara dug down as far as the lower world, and there they beheld<br>the horse, roaming about on the surface of the ground. And they saw the<br>magnanimous Kapila, who looked like a perfect mass of splendour. And<br>having beheld him shining with his brightness, just as the fire shineth<br>with its flames, they, O king! seeing the horse, were flushed with<br>delight. And they being incensed, sent forward by their fate, paid no<br>heed to the presence of the magnanimous Kapila, and ran forward with a<br>view to seizing the horse. Then, O great king! Kapila, the most righteous<br>of saints,&#8212;he whom the great sages name as Kapila Vasudeva&#8212;assumed a<br>fiery look, and the mighty saint shot flames towards them, and thereby<br>burnt down the dull-headed sons of Sagara. And Narada, whose practice of<br>austerities was very great, when he beheld them reduced to ashes, came to<br>Sagara's side, and gave the information to him. And when the king learnt<br>this terrible news which proceeded from the mouth of the saint, for<br>nearly an hour he remained sad, and then he bethought himself of what<br>Siva had said. Then sending for Ansuman, the son of Asamanjas, and his<br>own grandson, he, O chief of Bharata's race! spake the following words,<br>'Those same sixty thousand sons of unmeasured strength having encountered<br>Kapila's wrath, have met their death on my account. And, O my boy of<br>stainless character! thy father also hath been forsaken by me, in order<br>to discharge my duty (as a king), and being desirous of doing good to my<br>subjects.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O saint, whose sole wealth consists in religious<br>practices! Tell me for what reason, Sagara, the foremost of kings,<br>abandoned his own begotten son, endued with valour&#8212;an act so difficult<br>(for all other men)."<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'A son was born to Sagara, known by the name of Asamanjas,<br>he who was given birth to by the princess of Sivi. And he used to seize<br>by throat the feeble children of the townsmen, and threw them while<br>screaming into the river. And thereupon the townsmen, overwhelmed with<br>terror and grief, met together, and all standing with joined palms,<br>besought Sagara in the following way, 'O great king! Thou art our<br>protector from the dreaded peril of attack from a hostile force.<br>Therefore it is proper for thee to deliver us from the frightful danger,<br>proceeding from Asamanjas.' And the most righteous of the rulers of men,<br>having heard this frightful news from his subjects, for nearly an hour<br>remained sad and then spake to his ministers, saying, 'This day from the<br>city let my son Asamanjas be driven forth. If ye wish to do what will be<br>acceptable to me, let this be quickly done. 'And, O protector of men!<br>those same ministers, thus addressed by the king, performed in a hurry<br>exactly what the king had commanded them to do. Thus have I narrated to<br>thee how the magnanimous Sagara banished his son, with a view to the<br>welfare of the residents of the town. I shall now fully narrate to thee<br>what Ansuman of the powerful bow was told by Sagara. Listen to me!<br><br>"Sagara said, 'O my boy! sore am I at heart for having abandoned thy<br>father, on account of the death of my sons, and also on being<br>unsuccessful in getting back the horse. Therefore, O grandson! harassed<br>with grief and confounded with the obstruction to my religious rites as I<br>am, thou must bring back the horse and deliver me from hell.' Thus<br>addressed by the magnanimous Sagara, Ansuman went with sorrow to that<br>spot where the earth had been excavated. And by that very passage he<br>entered into the sea, and beheld that illustrious Kapila and that same<br>horse. And having beheld that ancient saint, most righteous of his order,<br>looking like a mass of light, he bowed with his head to the ground, and<br>informed him of the reason of his visit. Then, O great king, Kapila was<br>pleased with Ansuman, and that saint of a virtuous soul told him to ask<br>for a favour from him. And he in the first place prayed for the horse,<br>for the purpose of using it in the sacrifice; in the second place he<br>prayed for the purification of his fathers. Then the mighty chief of<br>saints, Kapila spake to him, saying, 'I shall grant thee everything that<br>thou desirest, O stainless (prince). May good luck be thine! In thee are<br>fixed (the virtues of) forbearance, and truth, and righteousness. By thee<br>hath Sagara had all his desires fulfilled. Thou are (really) a son to thy<br>father. And by thy ability the sons of Sagara will go to heaven (i.e.,<br>will be delivered from the consequences of their unhallowed death). And<br>the son of thy son, with a view to purifying the sons of Sagara, will<br>obtain the favour of the great god Siva, (by means of practising great<br>austerities), and will (thus) bring (to this world) the river that<br>floweth in three (separate) streams, Ganga, O chief of men! May good luck<br>be thine! Take thou with thee the sacrificial horse. Finish, my lad! the<br>sacrificial rites of the magnanimous Sagara.' Thus addressed by the<br>illustrious Kapila, Ansuman took the horse with him, and came back to the<br>sacrificial yard of the mighty-minded Sagara. Then he fell prostrate at<br>the feet of the high-souled Sagara, who smelt him on the head and<br>narrated all the events to him, all that had been seen and heard by him,<br>and likewise the destruction of Sagara's sons. He also announced that the<br>horse had been brought back to the sacrificial yard. And when king Sagara<br>heard of this, he no more grieved on account of his sons. And he praised<br>and honoured Ansuman, and finished those same sacrificial rites. His<br>sacrifice finished, Sagara was greeted honourably by all the gods; and he<br>converted the sea, Varuna's dwelling place, into a son of himself. And<br>the lotus-eyed (King Sagara) having ruled his kingdom for a period of<br>exceeding length, placed his grandson on the throne, (full of)<br>responsibilities and then ascended to heaven. And Ansuman likewise, O<br>great king! virtuous in soul, ruled over the world as far as the edge of<br>the sea, following the foot-prints of his father's father. His son was<br>named Dilipa, versed in virtue. Upon him placing the duties of his<br>sovereign post, Ansuman like-wise departed this life. And then when<br>Dilipa heard what an awful fate had overtaken his forefathers, he was<br>sorely grieved and thought of the means of raising them. And the ruler of<br>men made every great effort towards the descent of Ganga (to the mortal<br>world). But although trying to the utmost of his power, he could not<br>bring about what he so much wished. And a son was born to him, known by<br>the name of Bhagiratha beauteous, and devoted to a virtuous life, and<br>truthful, and free from feelings of malice. And Dilipa appointed him as<br>king, and betook himself to the forest life. And, O best of all the<br>scions of Bharata's race! that same king (Dilipa), devoted himself to a<br>successful course of austerities, and at the end of (sufficient) period,<br>from the forest departed to heaven."
