                            (Pativrata-mahatmya Parva)<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O mighty sage, I do not so much grieve for myself or<br>these my brothers or the loss of my kingdom as I do for this daughter of<br>Drupada. When we were afflicted at the game of the dice by those<br>wicked-souled ones, it was Krishna that delivered us. And she was<br>forcibly carried off from the forest by Jayadratha. Hast thou even seen<br>or heard of any chaste and exalted lady that resembleth this daughter of<br>Drupada?'"<br><br>"Markandeya said, 'Listen, O king, how the exalted merit of chaste<br>ladies, O Yudhishthira, was completely obtained by a princess named<br>Savitri. There was a king among the Madras, who was virtuous and highly<br>pious. And he always ministered unto the Brahmanas, and was high-souled<br>and firm in promise. And he was of subdued senses and given to<br>sacrifices. And he was the foremost of givers, and was able, and beloved<br>by both the citizens and the rural population. And the name of that lord<br>of Earth was Aswapati. And he was intent on the welfare of all beings.<br>And that forgiving (monarch) of truthful speech and subdued senses was<br>without issue. And when he got old, he was stricken with grief at this.<br>And with the object of raising offspring, he observed rigid vows and<br>began to live upon frugal fare, having recourse to the Brahmacharya mode<br>of life, and restraining his senses. And that best of kings, (daily)<br>offering ten thousand oblations to the fire, recited Mantras in honour of<br>Savitri[106] and ate temperately at the sixth hour. And he passed<br>eighteen years, practising such vows. Then when the eighteen years were<br>full, Savitri was pleased (with him). And O king, issuing with great<br>delight, in embodied form, from the Agnihotra fire, the goddess showed<br>herself to that king. And intent on conferring boons, she spoke these<br>words unto the monarch, 'I have been gratified, O king, with thy<br>Brahmacharya practices, thy purity and self-restraint and observance of<br>vows, and all thy endeavours and veneration! Do thou, O mighty king. O<br>Aswapati, ask for the boon that thou desirest! Thou ought, however, by no<br>means show any disregard for virtue.' Thereat Aswapati said, 'It is with<br>the desire of attaining virtue that I have been engaged in this task. O<br>goddess, may many sons be born unto me worthy of my race! If thou art<br>pleased with me, O goddess, I ask for this boon. The twice-born ones have<br>assured me that great merit lieth in having offspring!' Savitri replied,<br>'O king, having already learnt this thy intention, I had spoken unto that<br>lord, the Grandsire, about thy sons. Through the favour granted by the<br>Self-create, there shall speedily be born unto thee on earth a daughter<br>of great energy. It behoveth thee not to make any reply. Well-pleased, I<br>tell thee this at the command of the Grandsire.'<br><br>"Markandeya said, 'Having accepted Savitri's words and saying, 'So be<br>it!' the king again gratified her and said, 'May this happen soon!' On<br>Savitri vanishing away, the monarch entered his own city. And that hero<br>began to live in his kingdom, ruling his subjects righteously. And when<br>some time had elapsed, that king, observant of vows, begat offspring on<br>his eldest queen engaged in the practice of virtue. And then, O bull of<br>the Bharata race, the embryo in the womb of the princess of Malava<br>increased like the lord of stars in the heavens during the lighted<br>fortnight. And when the time came, she brought forth a daughter furnished<br>with lotus-like eyes. And that best of monarchs, joyfully performed the<br>usual ceremonies on her behalf. And as she had been bestowed with delight<br>by the goddess Savitri by virtue of the oblations offered in honour of<br>that goddess, both her father, and the Brahmanas named her Savitri. And<br>the king's daughter grew like unto Sree herself in an embodied form. And<br>in due time, that damsel attained her puberty. And beholding that<br>graceful maiden of slender waist and ample hips, and resembling a golden<br>image, people thought, 'We have received a goddess.' And overpowered by<br>her energy, none could wed that girl of eyes like lotus-leaves, and<br>possessed of a burning splendour.'<br><br>'And it came to pass that once on the occasion of a parva, having fasted<br>and bathed her head, she presented herself before the (family) deity and<br>caused the Brahmanas to offer oblations with due rites to the sacrificial<br>fire. And taking the flowers that had been offered to the god, that lady,<br>beautiful as Sree herself, went to her high-souled sire. And having<br>reverenced the feet of her father and offering him the flowers she had<br>brought, that maiden of exceeding grace, with joined hands, stood at the<br>side of the king. And seeing his own daughter resembling a celestial<br>damsel arrived at puberty, and unsought by people, the king became sad.<br>And the king said, 'Daughter, the time for bestowing thee is come! Yet<br>none asketh thee. Do thou (therefore) thyself seek for a husband equal to<br>thee in qualities! That person who may be desired by thee should be<br>notified to me. Do thou choose for thy husband as thou listest. I shall<br>bestow thee with deliberation. Do thou, O auspicious one, listen to me as<br>I tell thee the words which I heard recited by the twice-born ones. The<br>father that doth not bestow his daughter cometh by disgrace. And the<br>husband that knoweth not his wife in her season meeteth with disgrace.<br>And the son that doth not protect his mother when her husband is dead,<br>also suffereth disgrace. Hearing these words of mine, do thou engage<br>thyself in search of a husband. Do thou act in such a way that we may not<br>be censured by the gods!'<br><br>"Markandeya said, 'Having said these words to his daughter and his old<br>counsellors, he instructed the attendants to follow her, saying,&#8212;Go!<br>Thereat, bashfully bowing down unto her father's feet, the meek maid went<br>out without hesitation, in compliance with the words of her sire. And<br>ascending a golden car, she went to the delightful asylum of the royal<br>sages, accompanied by her father's aged counsellors. There, O son,<br>worshipping the feet of the aged ones, she gradually began to roam over<br>all the woods. Thus the king's daughter distributing wealth in all sacred<br>regions, ranged the various places belonging to the foremost of the<br>twice-born ones.'"
