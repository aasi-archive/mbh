                            "The fowler continued, 'Thus cursed by that rishi, I sought to propitiate<br>him with these words: 'Pardon me, O muni, I have done this wicked deed<br>unwittingly. It behooves thee to pardon all that. Do thou, worshipful<br>sir, soothe yourself.' The rishi replied, 'The curse that I have<br>pronounced can never be falsified, this is certain. But from kindness<br>towards thee, I shall do thee a favour. Though born in the Sudra class<br>thou shalt remain a pious man and thou shalt undoubtedly honour thy<br>parents; and by honouring them thou shalt attain great spiritual<br>perfection; thou shalt also remember the events of thy past life and<br>shalt go to heaven; and on the expiation of this curse, thou shalt again<br>become a Brahmana. O best of men, thus, of old was I cursed by that rishi<br>of severe power, and thus was he propitiated by me. Then, O good<br>Brahmana, I extricated the arrow from his body, and took him into the<br>hermitage, but he was not deprived of his life (recovered). O good<br>Brahmana, I have thus described to thee what happened to me of old, and<br>also how I can go to heaven hereafter.' The Brahmana said, 'O thou of<br>great intelligence, all men are thus subject to happiness or misery, thou<br>shouldst not therefore grieve for that. In obedience to the customs of<br>thy (present) race, thou hast pursued these wicked ways, but thou art<br>always devoted to virtue and versed in the ways and mysteries of the<br>world. And, O learned man, these being the duties of thy profession, the<br>stain of evil karma will not attach to thee. And after dwelling here for<br>some little time, thou shalt again become a Brahmana; and even now, I<br>consider thee to be a Brahmana, there is no doubt about this. For the<br>Brahmana who is vain and haughty, who is addicted to vices and wedded to<br>evil and degrading practices, is like a Sudra. On the other hand, I<br>consider a Sudra who is always adorned with these<br>virtues,&#8212;righteousness, self-restraint, and truthfulness,&#8212;as a<br>Brahmana. A man becomes a Brahmana by his character; by his own evil<br>karma a man attains an evil and terrible doom. O good man. I believe that<br>sin in thee has now died out. Thou must not grieve for this, for men,<br>like thee who art so virtuous and learned in the ways and mysteries of<br>the world, can have no cause for grief.'<br><br>"The fowler replied, 'The bodily afflictions should be cured with<br>medicines, and the mental ones with spiritual wisdom. This is the power<br>of knowledge. Knowing this, the wise should not behave like boys. Man of<br>low intelligence are overpowered with grief at the occurrence of<br>something which is not agreeable to them, or non-occurrence of something<br>which is good or much desired. Indeed, all creatures are subject to this<br>characteristic (of grief or happiness). It is not merely a single<br>creature or class that is subject to misery. Cognisant of this evil,<br>people quickly mend their ways, and if they perceive it at the very<br>outset they succeed in curing it altogether. Whoever grieves for it, only<br>makes himself uneasy. Those wise men whose knowledge has made them happy<br>and contented, and who are indifferent to happiness and misery alike, are<br>really happy. The wise are always contented and the foolish always<br>discontented. There is no end to discontentment, and contentment is the<br>highest happiness. People who have reached the perfect way, do not<br>grieve, they are always conscious of the final destiny of all creatures.<br>One must not give way to discontent[57] for it is like a virulent poison.<br>It kills persons of undeveloped intelligence, just as child is killed by<br>an enraged snake. That man has no manliness whose energies have left him<br>and who is overpowered with perplexity when an occasion for the exercise<br>of vigour presents itself. Our actions are surely followed by their<br>consequences. Whoever merely gives himself up to passive indifference (to<br>worldly affairs) accomplishes no good. Instead of murmuring one must try<br>to find out the way by which he can secure exemption from (spiritual)<br>misery; and the means of salvation found, he must then free himself from<br>sensuality. The man who has attained a high state of spiritual knowledge<br>is always conscious of the great deficiency (instability) of all matter.<br>Such a person keeping in view the final doom (of all), never grieves, I<br>too, O learned man, do not grieve; I stay here (in this life) biding my<br>time. For this reason, O best of men, I am not perplexed (with doubts)'.<br>The Brahmana said, 'Thou art wise and high in spiritual knowledge and<br>vast is thy intelligence. Thou who art versed in holy writ, art content<br>with thy spiritual wisdom. I have no cause to find fault with thee.<br>Adieu, O best of pious men, mayst thou be prosperous, and may<br>righteousness shield thee, and mayst thou be assiduous in the practice of<br>virtue.'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, The fowler said to him, 'Be it so'. And the good<br>Brahmana walked round him[58] and then departed. And the Brahmana<br>returning home was duly assiduous in his attention to his old parents. I<br>have thus, O pious Yudhishthira, narrated in detail to thee this history<br>full of moral instruction, which thou, my good son, didst ask me to<br>recite,&#8212;the virtue of women's devotion to their husbands and that of<br>filial piety.' Yudhishthira replied, 'O most pious Brahmana and best of<br>munis, thou hast related to me this good and wonderful moral story; and<br>listening to thee, O learned man, my time has glided away like a moment;<br>but, O adorable sir, I am not as yet satiated with hearing this moral[59]<br>discourse.'"
