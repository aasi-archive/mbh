                            "Markandeya continued, 'Do ye again hear from me the glory of the<br>Brahmanas! It is said that a royal sage of the name of Vainya was once<br>engaged in performing the horse-sacrifice and that Atri desired to go to<br>him for alms. But Atri subsequently gave up his desire of wealth, from<br>religious scruples. After much thought he, of great power, became<br>desirous of living in the woods, and, calling his wife and sons together,<br>addressed them thus, 'Let us attain the highly tranquil and complete<br>fruition of our desires. May it, therefore, be agreeable to you to repair<br>quickly to the forest for a life of great merit.' His wife, arguing from<br>motives of virtue also then said to him, 'Hie thee to the illustrious<br>prince Vainya, and beg of him vast riches! Asked by thee, that royal<br>sage, engaged in sacrifice will give thee wealth. Having gone there, O<br>regenerate Rishi, and received from him vast wealth, thou canst<br>distribute it among thy sons and servants and then thou canst go<br>whithersoever thou pleasest. This, indeed, is the higher virtue as<br>instanced by men conversant with religion.' Atri replied, 'I am informed,<br>O virtuous one, by the high-souled Gautama, that Vainya is a pious<br>prince, devoted to the cause of truth; but there are Brahmanas (about his<br>persons) who are jealous of me; and as Gautama hath told me this, I do<br>not venture to go there, for (while) there, if I were to advise what is<br>good and calculated to secure piety and the fulfilment of one's desires,<br>they would contradict me with words unproductive of any good. But I<br>approve of any counsel and will go there; Vainya will give me kine and<br>hoards of riches.'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'So saying, he, of great ascetic merit, hastened<br>to Vainya's sacrifice and reaching the sacrificial altar and making his<br>obeisance to the king and praising him with well-meaning speeches, he<br>spoke these words, 'Blessed art thou, O king! Ruling over the earth, thou<br>art the foremost of sovereigns! The Munis praise thee, and besides thee<br>there is none so versed in religious lore'! To him the Rishi Gautama, of<br>great ascetic merit, then indignantly replied saying, 'Atri, do not<br>repeat this nonsense. (It seems) thou art not in thy proper senses. In<br>this world of ours, Mahendra the lord of all created beings (alone) is<br>the foremost of all sovereigns!' Then, O, great prince, Atri said to<br>Gautama, 'As Indra, the lord of all creatures, ruleth over our destinies,<br>so doth this king! Thou art mistaken. It is thou who hast lost thine<br>senses from want of spiritual perception!' Gautama replied, 'I know I am<br>not mistaken; it is thou who art labouring under a misconception in this<br>matter. To secure the king's countenance, thou art flattering him in<br>(this) assembly of the people. Thou dost not know what the highest<br>virtue, is nor dost thou feel the need for it. Thou art like a child<br>steeped in ignorance, for what then hast thou become (so) old in years?'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'While those two men were thus disputing in the<br>presence of the Munis, who were engaged in Vainya's sacrifice the latter<br>enquired, 'What is the matter with them, that maketh them talk so<br>vociferously?' Then the very pious Kasyapa learned in all religious lore,<br>approaching the disputants asked them what was the matter. And then<br>Gautama, addressing that assembly of great Munis said, 'Listen, O great<br>Brahmanas, to the point in dispute between us. Atri hath said that Vainya<br>is the ruler of our destinies; great is our doubt on this point.'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'On hearing this, the great-mind Munis went<br>instantly to Sanatkumara who was well versed in religion to clear their<br>doubt. And then he of great ascetic merit, having heard the particulars<br>from them addressed them these words full of religious meaning. And<br>Sanatkumara said, 'As fire assisted by the wind burneth down forests, so<br>a Brahmana's energy in union with a Kshatriya's or a Kshatriya's joined<br>with a Brahmana's destroyeth all enemies. The sovereign is the<br>distinguished giver of laws and the protector of his subjects. He is (a<br>protector of created beings) like Indra, (a propounder of morals) like<br>Sukra, (a counsellor) like Vrihaspati and (hence he is also called) the<br>ruler of men's destinies. Who does not think it proper to worship the<br>individual of whom such terms as 'preserver of created beings,' 'royal,'<br>'emperor,' 'Kshatriya' (or saviour of the earth), 'lord of earth', 'ruler<br>of men', are applied in praise? The king is (also) styled the prime cause<br>(of social order, as being the promulgator of laws), 'the virtuous in<br>wars,' (and therefore, preserver after peace), 'the watchman,' 'the<br>contented,' 'the lord,' 'the guide to salvation,' 'the easily<br>victorious,' 'the Vishnu like,' 'of effective wrath,' 'the winner of<br>battles' and 'the cherisher of the true religion.' The Rishis, fearful of<br>sin, entrusted (the temporal) power to the Kshatriyas. As among the gods<br>in heaven the Sun dispelleth darkness by his effulgence, so doth the king<br>completely root out sin from this earth. Therefore is the king's<br>greatness reduced from the evidences of the sacred books, and we are<br>bound to pronounce for that side which hath spoken in favour of the king.'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Then that illustrious prince, highly pleased with<br>the victorious party, joyfully said to Atri, who had praised him<br>erewhile. 'O regenerate Rishi, thou hast made and styled me the greatest<br>and most excellent of men here, and compared me to the gods; therefore,<br>shall I give thee vast and various sorts of wealth. My impression is that<br>thou art omniscient. I give thee, O well-dressed and well-adorned one, a<br>hundred millions of gold coins and also ten bharas of gold. Then Atri, of<br>high austere virtues and great spiritual powers, thus welcomed (by the<br>king), accepted all the gifts without any breach of propriety, and<br>returned home. And then giving his wealth to his sons and subduing his<br>self, he cheerfully repaired to the forest with the object of performing<br>penances."
