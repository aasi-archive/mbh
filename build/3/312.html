                            Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Then agreeable to the words of the Yaksha the<br>Pandavas rose up; and in a moment their hunger and thirst left them.<br>Thereupon Yudhishthira said, 'I ask thee that art incapable of being<br>vanquished and that standest on one leg in the tank, what god art thou,<br>for I cannot take thee for a Yaksha! Art thou the foremost of the Vasus,<br>or of the Rudras, or of the chief of the Maruts? Or art thou the lord<br>himself of the celestials, wielder of the thunder-bolt! Each of these my<br>brothers is capable of fighting as hundred thousand warriors, and I see<br>not the warrior that can slay them all! I see also that their senses have<br>refreshed, as if they have sweetly awaked from slumber. Art thou a friend<br>of ours, or even our father himself? At this the Yaksha replied,-'O<br>child, I am even thy father, the Lord of justice, possessed of great<br>prowess! Know, bull of the Bharata race, that I came hither desirous of<br>beholding thee! Fame, truth, self-restraint, purity, candour, modesty,<br>steadiness, charity, austerities and Brahmacharya, these are my body! And<br>abstention from injury, impartiality, peace, penances, sanctity, and<br>freedom from malice are the doors (through which I am accessible). Thou<br>art always dear to me! By good luck thou art devoted to the five;[119]<br>and by good luck also thou hast conquered the six.[120] Of the six, two<br>appear in the first part of life; two in the middle part thereof; and the<br>remaining two at the end, in order to make men repair to the next world.<br>I am, good betide thee, the lord of justice! I came hither to test thy<br>merit. I am well-pleased to witness thy harmlessness; and, O sinless one,<br>I will confer boons on thee. Do thou, O foremost of kings, ask of me<br>boons. I shall surely confer them, O sinless one! Those that revere me,<br>never come by distress!' Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'A deer was carrying away<br>the Brahmana's fire-sticks. Therefore, the first boon that I shall ask,<br>is, may that Brahmana's adorations to Agni be not interrupted!' The<br>Yaksha said,&#8212;'O Kunti's son endued with splendour, it was I who for<br>examining thee, was carrying away, in the guise of a deer, that<br>Brahmana's fire-sticks!"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Thereupon that worshipful one said,&#8212;'I give<br>thee this boon! Good betide thee! O thou that are like unto an immortal,<br>ask thou a fresh boon! Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'We have spent these twelve<br>years in the forest; and the thirteenth year is come. May no one<br>recognise us, as we spend this year somewhere.'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,-'Thereat that worshipful one replied,&#8212;'I give<br>this boon unto thee!' And then reassuring Kunti's son having truth for<br>prowess, he also said, 'Even if, O Bharata, ye range this (entire) earth<br>in your proper forms none in the three worlds shall recognise you. Ye<br>perpetuators of the Kuru race, through my grace, ye will spend this<br>thirteenth year, secretly and unrecognised, in Virata's kingdom! And<br>every one of you will be able at will to assume any form he likes! Do ye<br>now present the Brahmana with his fire-sticks. It was only to test you<br>that I carried them away in the form of a deer! O amiable Yudhishthira,<br>do thou ask for another boon that thou mayst like! I will confer it on<br>thee. O foremost of men, I have not yet been satisfied by granting boons<br>to thee! Do thou my son, accept a third boon that is great and<br>incomparable! Thou, O king, art born of me, and Vidura of portion or<br>mine!" Thereat Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'It is enough that I have beheld thee<br>with my senses, eternal God of gods as thou art! O father, whatever boon<br>thou wilt confer on me I shall surely accept gladly! May I, O lord,<br>always conquer covetousness and folly and anger, and may my mind be ever<br>devoted to charity, truth, and ascetic austerities! The Lord of justice<br>said,&#8212;'Even by nature, O Pandava, hast thou been endued with these<br>qualities, for thou art the Lord of justice himself! Do thou again attain<br>what thou asked for!"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Having said these words, the worshipful Lord of<br>justice, who is the object of contemplation of all the worlds, vanished<br>therefrom; and the high-souled Pandavas after they had slept sweetly were<br>united with one another. And their fatigue dispelled, those heroes<br>returned to the hermitage, and gave back that Brahmana his firesticks.<br>That man who pursueth this illustrious and fame-enhancing story of the<br>revival (of the Pandavas) and the meeting of father and son (Dharma and<br>Yudhishthira), obtaineth perfect tranquillity of mind, and sons and<br>grandsons, and also a life extending over a hundred years! And the mind<br>of that man that layeth this story to heart, never delighteth in<br>unrighteousness, or in disunion among friends, or misappropriation of<br>other person's property, or staining other people's wives, or in foul<br>thoughts!
