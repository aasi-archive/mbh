                            Markandeya continued, "O Yudhishthira, the virtuous fowler, eminent in<br>pity, then skilfully addressed himself again to that foremost of<br>Brahmanas, saying, 'It is the dictum of the aged that the ways of<br>righteousness are subtle, diverse and infinite. When life is at stake and<br>in the matter of marriage, it is proper to tell an untruth. Untruth<br>sometimes leads to the triumph of truth, and the latter dwindles into<br>untruth. Whichever conduces most to the good of all creatures is<br>considered to be truth. Virtue is thus perverted; mark thou its subtle<br>ways. O best of virtuous men, man's actions are either good or bad, and<br>he undoubtedly reaps their fruits. The ignorant man having attained to an<br>abject state, grossly abuses the gods, not knowing that it is the<br>consequence of his own evil karma. The foolish, the designing and the<br>fickle, O good Brahmana, always attain the very reverse of happiness or<br>misery. Neither learning nor good morals, nor personal exertion can save<br>them. And if the fruits of our exertion were not dependent on anything<br>else, people would attain the object of their desire, by simply striving<br>to attain it.<br><br>It is seen that able, intelligent and diligent persons are baffled in<br>their efforts, and do not attain the fruits of their actions. On the<br>other hand, persons who are always active in injuring others and in<br>practising deception on the world, lead a happy life. There are some who<br>attain prosperity without any exertion. And there are others, who with<br>the utmost exertion, are unable to achieve their dues. Miserly persons<br>with the object of having sons born to them worship the gods, and<br>practise severe austerities, and those sons having remained in the womb<br>for ten months at length turn out to be very infamous issue of their<br>race; and others begotten under the same auspices, decently pass their<br>lives in luxury with heaps of riches and grain accumulated by their<br>ancestors. The diseases from which man suffer, are undoubtedly the result<br>of their own karma. They then behave like small deer at the hands of<br>hunters, and they are racked with mental troubles. And, O Brahmana, as<br>hunters intercept the flight of their game, the progress of those<br>diseases is checked by able and skilful physicians with their collections<br>of drugs. And, the best of the cherishers of religion, thou hast observed<br>that those who have it in their power to enjoy (the good things of this<br>earth), are prevented from doing so from the fact of their suffering from<br>chronic bowel-complaints, and that many others that are strong and<br>powerful, suffer from misery, and are enabled with great difficulty to<br>obtain a livelihood; and that every man is thus helpless, overcome by<br>misery and illusion, and again and again tossed and overpowered by the<br>powerful current of his own actions (karma). If there were absolute<br>freedom of action, no creature would die, none would be subject to decay,<br>or await his evil doom, and everybody would attain the object of his<br>desire. All persons desire to out distance their neighbours (in the race<br>of life), and they strive to do so to the utmost of their power; but the<br>result turns out otherwise. Many are the persons born under the influence<br>of the same star and the same auspices of good luck; but a great<br>diversity is observable in the maturity of their actions. No person, O<br>good Brahmana, can be the dispenser of his own lot. The actions done in a<br>previous existence are seen to fructify in our present life. It is the<br>immemorial tradition that the soul is eternal and everlasting, but the<br>corporeal frame of all creatures is subject to destruction here (below).<br>When therefore life is extinguished, the body only is destroyed, but the<br>spirit, wedded to its actions, travels elsewhere.'<br><br>"The Brahmana replied, 'O best of those versed in the doctrine of karma,<br>and in the delivery of discourses, I long to know accurately how the soul<br>becomes eternal.' The fowler replied, 'The spirit dies not, there being<br>simply a change of tenement. They are mistaken, who foolishly say that<br>all creatures die. The soul betakes itself to another frame, and its<br>change of habitation is called its death. In the world of men, no man<br>reaps the consequences of another man's karma. Whatever one does, he is<br>sure to reap the consequences thereof; for the consequences of the karma<br>that is once done, can never be obviated. The virtuous become endowed<br>with great virtues, and sinful men become the perpetrators of wicked<br>deeds. Men's actions follow them; and influenced by these, they are born<br>again.' The Brahmana enquired, 'Why does the spirit take its birth, and<br>why does its nativity become sinful or virtuous, and how, O good man,<br>does it come to belong to a sinful or virtuous race?' The fowler replied,<br>This mystery seems to belong to the subject of procreation, but I shall<br>briefly describe to you, O good Brahmana, how the spirit is born again<br>with its accumulated load of karma, the righteous in a virtuous, and the<br>wicked in a sinful nativity. By the performance of virtuous actions it<br>attains to the state of the gods, and by a combination of good and evil,<br>it acquires the human state; by indulgence in sensuality and similar<br>demoralising practices it is born in the lower species of animals, and by<br>sinful acts, it goes to the infernal regions. Afflicted with the miseries<br>of birth and dotage, man is fated to rot here below from the evil<br>consequences of his own actions. Passing through thousands of births as<br>also the infernal regions, our spirits wander about, secured by the<br>fetters of their own karma. Animate beings become miserable in the next<br>world on account of these actions done by themselves and from the<br>reaction of those miseries, they assume lower births and then they<br>accumulate a new series of actions, and they consequently suffer misery<br>over again, like sickly men partaking of unwholesome food; and although<br>they are thus afflicted, they consider themselves to be happy and at ease<br>and consequently their fetters are not loosened and new karma arises; and<br>suffering from diverse miseries they turn about in this world like a<br>wheel. If casting off their fetters they purify themselves by their<br>actions and practise austerities and religious meditations, then, O best<br>of Brahmanas, they attain the Elysian regions by these numerous acts and<br>by casting off their fetters and by the purification of karma, men attain<br>those blissful regions where misery is unknown to those who go there. The<br>sinful man who is addicted to vices, never comes to the end of his course<br>of iniquities. Therefore must we strive to do what is virtuous and<br>forbear from doing what is unrighteous. Whoever with a heart full of<br>gratefulness and free from malice strives to do what is good, attains<br>wealth, virtue, happiness and heaven (hereafter). Those who are purified<br>of sins, wise, forbearing, constant in righteousness, and self-restrained<br>enjoy continuous felicity in this as well as in the next world. Man must<br>follow the standard of virtue of the good and in his acts imitate the<br>example of the righteous. There are virtuous men, versed in holy writ and<br>learned in all departments of knowledge. Man's proper duty consists in<br>following his own proper avocation, and this being the case these latter<br>do not become confused and mixed up. The wise man delights in virtue and<br>lives by righteousness. And, O good Brahmana, such a man with the wealth<br>of righteousness which he hereby acquires, waters the root of the plant<br>in which he finds most virtue. The virtuous man acts thus and his mind is<br>calmed. He is pleased with his friends in this world and he also attains<br>happiness hereafter. Virtuous people, O good man, acquire dominion over<br>all and the pleasure of beauty, flavour, sound and touch according to<br>their desire. These are known to be the rewards of virtue. But the man of<br>enlightened vision, O great Brahmana, is not satisfied with reaping the<br>fruits of righteousness. Not content with that, he with the light of<br>spiritual wisdom that is in him, becomes indifferent to pain and pleasure<br>and the vice of the world influenceth him not. Of his own free will he<br>becometh indifferent to worldly pursuits but he forsaketh not virtue.<br>Observing that everything worldly is evanescent, he trieth to renounce<br>everything and counting on more chance he deviseth means for the<br>attainment of salvation. Thus doth he renounce the pursuits of the world,<br>shuneth the ways of sin, becometh virtuous and at last attaineth<br>salvation. Spiritual wisdom is the prime requisite of men for salvation,<br>resignation and forbearance are its roots. By this means he attaineth all<br>the objects of this desire. But subduing the senses and by means of<br>truthfulness and forbearance, he attaineth, O good Brahmana, the supreme<br>asylum of Brahma.' The Brahmana again enquired, 'O thou most eminent in<br>virtue and constant in the performance of the religious obligations, you<br>talk of senses; what are they; how may they be subdued; and what is the<br>good of subduing them; and how doth a creature reap the fruits thereof? O<br>pious man, I beg to acquaint myself with the truth of this matter."
