                            "Markandeya said, 'Meanwhile the illustrious descendant of Raghu, along<br>with his brother, hospitably treated by Sugriva, continued to dwell on<br>the breast of the Malyavat hill, beholding every day the clear blue sky.<br>And one night, while gazing from the mountain-top on the bright moon in<br>the cloudless sky surrounded by planets and stars and stellar bodies,<br>that slayer of foes was suddenly awakened (to a remembrance of Sita) by<br>the cold breezes fragrant with the perfumes of the lily, lotus and other<br>flowers of the same species. And virtuous Rama, dejected in spirits at<br>the thought of Sita's captivity in the abode of the Rakshasa, addressed<br>the heroic Lakshmana in the morning saying, 'Go, Lakshmana and seek in<br>Kishkindhya that ungrateful king off the monkeys, who understand well his<br>own interest and is even now indulging in dissipations, that foolish<br>wretch of his race whom I have installed on a throne and to whom all apes<br>and monkeys and bears owe allegiance, that fellow for whose sake, O<br>mighty-armed perpetuator of Raghu's race, Vali was slain by me with thy<br>help in the wood of Kishkindhya! I regard that worst of monkeys on earth<br>to be highly ungrateful, for, O Lakshmana, that wretch hath now forgotten<br>me who am sunk in such distress! I think he is unwilling to fulfil his<br>pledge, disregarding, from dullness of understanding, one who hath done<br>him such services! If thou findest him lukewarm and rolling in sensual<br>joys, thou must then send him, by the path Vali hath been made to follow,<br>to the common goal of all creatures! If, on the other hand, thou seest<br>that foremost of monkeys delight in our cause, then, O descendant of<br>Kakutstha, shouldst thou bring him hither with thee! Be quick, and delay<br>not!' Thus addressed by his brother, Lakshmana ever attentive to the<br>behests and welfare of his superiors, set out taking with him his<br>handsome bow with string and arrows. And reaching the gates of<br>Kishkindhya he entered the city unchallenged. And knowing him to be<br>angry, the monkey-king advanced to receive him. And with his wife,<br>Sugriva the king of the monkeys, with a humble heart, joyfully received<br>him with due honours. And the dauntless son of Sumitra then told him what<br>Rama had said. And having heard everything in detail, O mighty monarch,<br>Sugriva, the king of the monkeys with his wife and servants, joined his<br>hands, and cheerfully said unto Lakshmana, that elephant among men, these<br>words: 'I am, O Lakshmana, neither wicked, nor ungrateful, nor destitute<br>of virtue! Hear what efforts I have made for finding out Sita's place of<br>captivity! I have despatched diligent monkeys in all directions. All of<br>them have stipulated to return within a month. They will, O hero, search<br>the whole earth with her forests and hills and seas, her villages and<br>towns and cities and mines. Only five nights are wanting to complete that<br>month, and then thou wilt, with Rama, hear tidings of great joy!'<br><br>"Thus addressed by that intelligent king of the monkeys, the high-souled<br>Lakshmana became appeased, and he in his turn worshipped Sugriva. And<br>accompanied by Sugriva, he returned to Rama on the breast of the Malyavat<br>hill. And approaching him, Lakshmana informed him of the beginning<br>already made in respect of his undertaking. And soon thousands of<br>monkey-chiefs began to return, after having carefully searched the three<br>quarters of the earth, viz., the North, the East and the West. But they<br>that had gone towards the South did not make their appearance And they<br>that came back represented to Rama, saying that although they had<br>searched the whole earth with her belt of seas, yet they could not find<br>either the princess of Videha or Ravana. But that descendant of<br>Kakutstha's race, afflicted at heart, managed to live yet, resting his<br>hopes (of hearing Sita's tidings) on the great monkeys that had gone<br>towards the South.<br><br>"After the lapse of two months, several monkeys seeking with haste the<br>presence of Sugriva, addressed him, saying, 'O king, that foremost of<br>monkeys, the son of Pavana, as also Angada, the son of Vali, and the<br>other great monkeys whom thou hadst despatched to search the southern<br>region, have come back and are pillaging that great and excellent orchard<br>called Madhuvana, which was always guarded by Vali and which hath been<br>well-guarded by thee also after him!' Hearing of this act of liberty on<br>their part, Sugriva inferred the success of their mission, for it is only<br>servants that have been crowned with success that can act in this way.<br>And that intelligent and foremost of monkeys communicated his suspicions<br>to Rama. And Rama also, from this, guessed that the princess of Mithila<br>had been seen. Then Hanuman and the other monkeys, having refreshed<br>themselves thus, came towards their king, who was then staying with Rama<br>and Lakshmana. And, O Bharata, observing the gait of Hanuman and the<br>colour of his face, Rama was confirmed in the belief that Hanuman had<br>really seen Sita. Then those successful monkeys with Hanuman at their<br>head, duly bowed unto Rama and Lakshmana and Sugriva. And Rama then<br>taking up his bow and quiver, addressed those monkeys, saying, 'Have you<br>been successful? Will ye impart life unto me? Will ye once more enable me<br>to reign in Ayodhya after having slain my enemy in battle and rescued the<br>daughter of Janaka? With the princess of Videha unrescued, and the foe<br>unslain in battle, I dare not live, robbed of wife and honour!' Thus<br>addressed by Rama, the son of Pavana, replied unto him, saying, 'I bring<br>thee good news, O Rama; for Janaka's daughter hath been seen by me.<br>Having searched the southern region with all its hills, forests, and<br>mines for some time, we became very weary. At length we beheld a great<br>cavern. And having beheld it, we entered that cavern which extended over<br>many Yojanas. It was dark and deep and overgrown with trees and infested<br>by worms. And having gone a great way through it, we came upon sun-shine<br>and beheld a beautiful palace. It was, O Raghava, the abode of the Daitya<br>Maya. And there we beheld a female ascetic named Prabhavati engaged in<br>ascetic austerities. And she gave us food and drink of various kinds. And<br>having refreshed ourselves therewith and regained our strength, we<br>proceeded along the way shown by her. At last we came out of the cavern<br>and beheld the briny sea, and on its shores, the Sahya, the Malaya and<br>the great Dardura mountains. And ascending the mountains of Malaya, we<br>beheld before us the vast ocean.[91] And beholding it we felt sorely<br>grieved in mind. And dejected in spirits and afflicted with pain and<br>famishing with hunger, we despaired of returning with our lives. Casting<br>our eyes on the great ocean extending over many hundreds of Yojanas and<br>abounding in whales and alligators and other aquatic animals, we became<br>anxious and filled with grief. We then sat together, resolved to die<br>there of starvation. And in course of conversation we happened to talk of<br>the vulture Jatayu. Just then we saw a bird huge as a mountain, of<br>frightful form, and inspiring terror into every heart, like a second son<br>of Vinata.[92] And coming upon us unawares for devouring us, he said,<br>'Who are ye that are speaking thus of my brother Jatayu? I am his elder<br>brother, by name Sampati, and am the king of birds. Once upon a time, we<br>two, with the desire of outstripping each other, flew towards the sun. My<br>wings got burnt, but those of Jatayu were not. That was the last time I<br>saw my beloved brother Jatayu, the king of vultures! My wings burnt, I<br>fell down upon the top of this great mountain where I still am!' When he<br>finished speaking, we informed him of the death of his brother in a few<br>words and also of this calamity that hath befallen thee! And, O king, the<br>powerful Sampati heating this unpleasant news from us, was greatly<br>afflicted and again enquired of us, saying, 'Who is this Rama and why was<br>Sita carried off and how was Jatayu slain? Ye foremost of monkeys I wish<br>to hear everything in detail!' We then informed him of everything about<br>this calamity of thine and of the reason also of our vow of starvation.<br>That king of birds then urged us (to give up our vow) by these words of<br>his: 'Ravana is, indeed, known to me. Lanka is his capital. I beheld it<br>on the other side of the sea in a valley of the Trikuta hills! Sita must<br>be there. I have little doubt of this!' Hearing these words of his, we<br>rose up quickly and began, O chastiser of foes, to take counsel of one<br>another for crossing the ocean! And when none dared to cross it, I,<br>having recourse to my father, crossed the great ocean which is a hundred<br>Yojanas in width. And having slain the Rakshasis on the waters, I saw the<br>chaste Sita within Ravana's harem, observing ascetic austerities, eager<br>to behold her lord, with matted locks on head, and body besmeared with<br>filth, and lean, and melancholy and helpless. Recognising her as Sita by<br>those unusual signs, and approaching that worshipful lady while alone, I<br>said, 'I am, O Sita, an emissary of Rama and monkey begotten by<br>Pavana![93] Desirous of having a sight of thee, hither have I come<br>travelling through the skies! Protected by Sugriva, that monarch of all<br>the monkeys, the royal brothers Rama and Lakshmana are in peace! And<br>Rama, O lady, with Sumitra's son, hath enquired of thy welfare! And<br>Sugriva also, on account of his friendship (with Rama and Lakshmana)<br>enquireth of thy welfare. Followed by all the monkeys, thy husband will<br>soon be here. Confide in me, O adorable lady, I am a monkey and not a<br>Rakshasa!' Thus addressed by me, Sita seemed to meditate for a moment and<br>then replied to me, saying, 'From the words of Avindhya I know that thou<br>art Hanuman! O mighty-armed one, Avindhya is an old and respected<br>Rakshasa! He told me that Sugriva is surrounded by counsellors like thee.<br>Thou mayst depart now!' And with these words she gave me this jewel as a<br>credential. And, indeed, it was by means of this jewel that the faultless<br>Sita had been able to support her existence. And the daughter of Janaka<br>further told me as a token from her, that by thee, O tiger among men, a<br>blade of grass (inspired with Mantras and thus converted into a fatal<br>weapon) had once been shot at a crow while ye were on the breast of the<br>mighty hill known by the name of Chitrakuta! And this she said as<br>evidence of my having met her and hers being really the princess of<br>Videha. I then caused myself to be seized by Ravana's soldiers, and then<br>set fire to the city of Lanka!'"
