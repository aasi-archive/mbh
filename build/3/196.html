                            "Markandeya said, 'One day it was resolved by the gods that they should<br>descend on the earth and try the goodness and virtue of king Sivi, the<br>son of Usinara. And addressing each other,&#8212;'Well'&#8212;Agni and Indra came<br>to the earth. And Agni took the form of a pigeon flying away from Indra<br>who pursued him in the form of a hawk, and that pigeon fell upon the lap<br>of king Sivi who was seated on an excellent seat. And the priest<br>thereupon addressing the king said, 'Afraid of the hawk and desirous of<br>saving its life, this pigeon hath come to thee for safety. The learned<br>have said that the falling of a pigeon upon one's body forebodeth a great<br>danger. Let the king that understands omens give away wealth for saving<br>himself from the danger indicated.' And the pigeon also addressed the<br>king and said, 'Afraid of the hawk and desirous of saving my life I have<br>come to thee for protection. I am a Muni. Having assumed the form of a<br>pigeon, I come to thee as a seeker of thy protection. Indeed, I seek thee<br>as my life. Know me as one possessed of Vedic lore, as one leading the<br>Brahmacharya mode of life, as one possessed also of self-control and<br>ascetic virtues. And know me further as one that has never spoken<br>disagreeably unto his preceptor, as one possessed of every virtue indeed,<br>as one that is sinless. I repeat the Vedas, I know their prosody; indeed,<br>I have studied all the Vedas letter by letter. I am not a pigeon. Oh, do<br>not yield me up to the hawk. The giving up of a learned and pure Brahmana<br>can never be a good gift.' And after the pigeon said so, the hawk<br>addressed the king, and said, 'Creatures do not come into the world in<br>the same particular order. In the order of creation, thou mayst, in a<br>former birth, have been begotten by this pigeon. It is not proper for<br>thee, O king, to interfere with my food by protecting this pigeon (even<br>though he might have been thy father).' And thus addressed, the king<br>said, 'Hath any one, before this, seen birds thus speak the pure speech<br>of man? Knowing what this pigeon sayeth, and this hawk also, how can we<br>act to-day according to virtue? He that giveth up an affrighted creature<br>seeking protection, unto its foe, doth not obtain protection when he is<br>in need of it himself. Indeed, the very clouds do not shower rain<br>seasonably for him, and the seeds though scattered do not grow for him.<br>He that giveth up an afflicted creature seeking protection unto its foe,<br>hath to see his offspring die in childhood. The ancestor of such a person<br>can never dwell in heaven; indeed, the very gods decline to accept the<br>libations of clarified butter poured by him into the fire. He that giveth<br>up an affrighted creature seeking protection, unto its foe, is struck<br>with the thunder-bolt by the gods with Indra at their head. The food that<br>he eateth is unsanctified, and he, of a narrow soul, falleth from heaven<br>very soon. O hawk, let the people of the Sivi tribe place before thee a<br>bull cooked with rice instead of this pigeon. And let them also carry to<br>the place where thou livest in joy, meat in abundance.' And hearing this,<br>the hawk said, 'O king, I do not ask for a bull, nor, indeed, any other<br>meat, nor meat more in quantity than that of this pigeon. It hath been<br>given to me by the gods. The creature, therefore, is my food today in<br>consequence of its death that hath been ordained. Therefore, O monarch,<br>give it up to me.' Thus addressed by the hawk, the king said, 'Let my men<br>see and carefully carry the bull to thee with every limb entire. Let that<br>bull be the ransom of this creature afflicted with fright and let it be<br>carried to thee before my eyes. Oh, slay not this pigeon! I will yield up<br>my very life, yet I would not give up this pigeon. Dost thou not know, O<br>hawk, that this creature looketh like a sacrifice with the Soma juice? O<br>blessed one, cease to take so much trouble for it. I cannot, by any<br>means, yield up the pigeon to thee. Or, O hawk, if it pleases thee,<br>command me to do some such thing which I may do for thee, which may be<br>agreeable to thee, and upon doing which the men of the Sivi tribe may yet<br>in joy bless me in terms of applause. I promise thee that I will do what<br>thou mayst did me do.' And at this appeal of the king, the hawk said, 'O<br>king, if thou givest me as much flesh as would be equal to the weight of<br>the pigeon, cutting it off thy right thigh; then can the pigeon be<br>properly saved by thee; then wouldst thou do what would be agreeable to<br>me and what the men of the Sivi tribe would speak of in terms of praise.'<br>And the king agreed to this and he cut off a piece of flesh from his<br>right thigh and weighed it against the pigeon. But the pigeon weighed<br>heavier. And thereupon the king cut off another piece of his flesh, but<br>the pigeon still weighed heavier, and then the king cut off pieces of<br>flesh from all parts of his body and placed them on the scale. But the<br>pigeon still weighed heavier, and then the king himself ascended the<br>scale and he felt no grief at this and beholding this, the hawk<br>disappeared there saying&#8212;(The pigeon hath been) Saved,&#8212;And the king<br>asked the pigeon saying, 'O pigeon, let the Sivis know who the hawk is.<br>None but the lord of the universe could do as he did. O Holy One, answer<br>thou this question of mine!' And the pigeon then said, 'I am the<br>smoke-bannered Agni called also Vaiswanara. The hawk is none other than<br>Sachi's lord armed with the thunder-bolt. O son of Suratha, thou art a<br>bull among men. We came to try thee. These pieces of flesh, O king, that<br>thou hast cut off with thy sword from thy body for saving me have caused<br>gashes in thy body. I will make these marks auspicious and handsome and<br>they will be of the colour of gold and emit a sweet perfume, and earning<br>great fame and respected by the gods and the Rishis thou shall long rule<br>these subjects of thine, and a son will spring from thy flank who shall<br>be called Kapataroman. O king, thou shalt obtain this son of the name of<br>Kapataroman from out of thy own body and thou wilt behold him become the<br>foremost of the Saurathas, blazing with renown, possessed of bravery and<br>great personal beauty!"
