                            "Markandeya said, 'That heroic king of the vultures, Jatayu, having<br>Sampati for his uterine brother and Arjuna himself for his father, was a<br>friend of Dasaratha. And beholding his daughter-in-law Sita on the lap of<br>Ravana, that ranger of the skies rushed in wrath against the king of the<br>Rakshasas. And the vulture addressed Ravana, saying, 'Leave the princess<br>of Mithila, leave her I say! How canst thou, O Rakshasa, ravish her when<br>I am alive? If thou dost not release my daughter-in-law, thou shalt not<br>escape from me with life!' And having said these words Jatayu began to<br>tear the king of the Rakshasas with his talons. And he mangled him in a<br>hundred different parts of his body by striking him with his wings and<br>beaks. And blood began to flow as copiously from Ravana's body as water<br>from a mountain spring. And attacked thus by that vulture desirous of<br>Rama's good, Ravana, taking up a sword, cut off the two wings of that<br>bird. And having slain that king of the vultures, huge as a mountain-peak<br>shooting forth above the clouds, the Rakshasa rose high in the air with<br>Sita on his lap. And the princess of Videha, wherever she saw an asylum<br>of ascetics, a lake, a river, or a tank, threw down an ornament of hers.<br>And beholding on the top of a mountain five foremost of monkeys, that<br>intelligent lady threw down amongst them a broad piece of her costly<br>attire. And that beautiful and yellow piece of cloth fell, fluttering<br>through the air, amongst those five foremost of monkeys like lightning<br>from the clouds. And that Rakshasa soon passed a great way through the<br>firmament like a bird through the air. And soon the Rakshasa beheld his<br>delightful and charming city of many gates, surrounded on all sides by<br>high walls and built by Viswakrit himself. And the king of the Rakshasa<br>then entered his own city known by the name of Lanka, accompanied by<br>Sita.'<br><br>"And while Sita was being carried away, the intelligent Rama, having<br>slain the great deer, retraced his steps and saw his brother Lakshmana<br>(on the way). And beholding his brother, Rama reproved him, saying, 'How<br>couldst thou come hither, leaving the princess of Videha in a forest that<br>is haunted by the Rakshasa?' And reflecting on his own enticement to a<br>great distance by that Rakshasa in the guise of a deer and on the arrival<br>of his brother (leaving Sita alone in the asylum), Rama was filled with<br>agony. And quickly advancing towards Lakshmana while reproving him still,<br>Rama asked him, 'O Lakshmana, is the princess of Videha still alive? I<br>fear she is no more!' Then Lakshmana told him everything about what Sita<br>had said, especially that unbecoming language of hers subsequently. With<br>a burning heart Rama then ran towards the asylum. And on the way he<br>beheld a vulture huge as a mountain, lying in agonies of death. And<br>suspecting him to be a Rakshasa, the descendant of the Kakutstha race,<br>along with Lakshmana rushed towards him, drawing with great force his bow<br>to a circle. The mighty vulture, however, addressing them both, said,<br>'Blessed be ye, I am the king of the vultures, and friend of Dasaratha!'<br>Hearing these words of his, both Rama and his brother put aside their<br>excellent bow and said, 'Who is this one that speaketh the name of our<br>father in these woods?' And then they saw that creature to be a bird<br>destitute of two wings, and that bird then told them of his own overthrow<br>at the hands of Ravana for the sake of Sita. Then Rama enquired of the<br>vulture as to the way Ravana had taken. The vulture answered him by a nod<br>of his head and then breathed his last. And having understood from the<br>sign the vulture had made that Ravana had gone towards the south, Rama<br>reverencing his father's friend, caused his funeral obsequies to be duly<br>performed. Then those chastisers of foes, Rama and Lakshmana, filled with<br>grief at the abduction of the princess of Videha, took a southern path<br>through the Dandaka woods beholding along their way many uninhabited<br>asylums of ascetics, scattered over with seats of Kusa grass and<br>umbrellas of leaves and broken water-pots, and abounding with hundreds of<br>jackals. And in that great forest, Rama along with Sumatra's son beheld<br>many herds of deer running in all directions. And they heard a loud<br>uproar of various creatures like what is heard during a fast spreading<br>forest conflagration. And soon they beheld a headless Rakshasa of<br>terrible mien. And that Rakshasa was dark as the clouds and huge as a<br>mountain, with shoulders broad as those of a Sola tree, and with arms<br>that were gigantic. And he had a pair of large eyes on his breast, and<br>the opening of his mouth was placed on his capacious belly. And that<br>Rakshasa seized Lakshmana by the hand, without any difficulty. And seized<br>by the Rakshasa the son of Sumitra, O Bharata, became utterly confounded<br>and helpless. And casting his glances on Rama, that headless Rakshasa<br>began to draw Lakshmana towards that part of his body where his mouth<br>was. And Lakshmana in grief addressed Rama, saying, 'Behold my plight!<br>The loss of thy kingdom, and then the death of our father, and then the<br>abduction of Sita, and finally this disaster that hath overwhelmed me!<br>Alas, I shall not behold thee return with the princess of Videha to<br>Kosala and seated on thy ancestral throne as the ruler of the entire<br>Earth! They only that are fortunate will behold thy face, like unto the<br>moon emerged from the clouds, after thy coronation bath in water<br>sanctified with Kusa grass and fried paddy and black peas!' And the<br>intelligent Lakshmana uttered those and other lamentations in the same<br>strain. The illustrious descendant, however, of Kakutstha's race<br>undaunted amid danger, replied unto Lakshmana, saying, 'Do not, O tiger<br>among men, give way to grief! What is this thing when I am here? Cut thou<br>off his right arm and I shall cut off his left.' And while Rama was still<br>speaking so, the left arm of the monster was severed by him, cut off with<br>a sharp scimitar, as if indeed, that arm were a stalk of the Tila corn.<br>The mighty son of Sumitra then beholding his brother standing before him<br>struck off with his sword the right arm also of that Rakshasa. And<br>Lakshmana also began to repeatedly strike Rakshasa under the ribs, and<br>then that huge headless monster fell upon the ground and expired quickly.<br>And then there came out from the Rakshasa's body a person of celestial<br>make. And he showed himself to the brothers, staying for a moment in the<br>skies, like the Sun in his effulgence in the firmament. And Rama skilled<br>in speech, asked him, saying, 'Who art thou? Answer me who enquire of<br>thee? Whence could such a thing happen? All this seems to me to be<br>exceedingly wonderful!' Thus addressed by Rama, that being replied unto<br>him, saying, 'I am, O prince, a Gandharva of the name of Viswavasu! It<br>was through the curse of a Brahmana that I had to assume the form and<br>nature of a Rakshasa. As to thyself, O Rama, Sita hath been carried away<br>with violence by king Ravana who dwelleth in Lanka. Repair thou unto<br>Sugriva who will give thee his friendship. There, near enough to the peak<br>of Rishyamuka is the lake known by the name of Pampa of sacred water and<br>cranes. There dwelleth, with four of his counsellors, Sugriva, the<br>brother of the monkey-king Vali decked with a garland of gold. Repairing<br>unto him, inform of thy cause of sorrow. In plight very much like thy<br>own, he will render thee assistance. This is all that we can say. Thou<br>wilt, without doubt, see the daughter of Janaka! Without doubt Ravana and<br>others are known to the king of the monkeys!' Having said these words,<br>that celestial being of great effulgence made himself invisible, and<br>those heroes, both Rama and Lakshmana, wondered much."
