                            "Vaisampayana continued, 'Having ascertained the opinion of his brothers,<br>and of the intelligent Narada, king Yudhishthira, addressing Dhaumya, who<br>was like unto the Grandsire himself, said, 'I have for the acquisition of<br>arms, sent away that tiger among men, Jishnu, whose prowess is incapable<br>of being baffled, and who is possessed of long arms and immeasurable<br>intelligence. O thou of ascetic wealth, that hero is devoted to me,<br>endued with ability, and well-skilled in weapons, and like unto the<br>exalted Vasudeva himself. I know them both, Krishna and Arjuna, those<br>destroyers of enemies, O Brahmana, endued with prowess, even as the<br>puissant Vyasa knoweth them. I know Vasudeva and Dhananjaya to be none<br>else than Vishnu himself, possessed of the six attributes. And this is<br>also what Narada knoweth, for he hath always spoken so unto me. I also<br>know them to be Rishis, Nara and Narayana. Knowing him to possess the<br>ability, I have sent him (on the mission). Not inferior unto Indra and<br>fully competent (for the task), I have sent that son of a god to see the<br>lord of the celestials and obtain weapons from him. Bhishma and Drona are<br>Atirathas. Kripa and the son of Drona are invincible; these mighty<br>warriors have been installed by Dhritarashtra's son in the command of his<br>army. All these are versed in the Vedas, are heroic, and possessed of the<br>knowledge of every weapon. Endued with great strength, these always<br>desire to encounter Arjuna in fight. And Karna also of the Suta caste is<br>a mighty warrior versed in celestial weapons. In respect of the impetus<br>of his weapons, he is endued with the strength of the Wind-god. Himself<br>like a flame of fire, the arrows (proceeding from him) constitute its<br>tongues. The slaps of his left hand cased in leathern fence constitute<br>the crackling of that flame. The dust of the battle-field is its smoke.<br>Urged by the sons of Dhritarashtra even as the wind urgeth the fire,<br>Karna like unto the all-consuming fire at the end of the Yuga that is<br>sent by Death himself, will, without doubt, consume my troops like unto a<br>heap of straw. Only that mighty mass of clouds called Arjuna, aided by<br>Krishna like unto a powerful wind, with celestial weapon representing its<br>fierce lightning, the white steeds, the rows of white cranes coursing<br>underneath and the unbearable Gandiva, the rainbow ahead, is capable of<br>extinguishing the blazing flame represented by Karna by means of its<br>arrowy showers let off with unflagging steadiness. That conqueror of<br>hostile cities, Vibhatsu, will, without doubt, succeed in obtaining from<br>Indra himself all the celestial weapons with their fullness and life.<br>Alone he is equal, I think, unto them all. Otherwise it is impossible<br>(for us) to vanquish in fight all those foes, who have attained to<br>eminent success in all their purposes. We shall behold Arjuna, that<br>repressor of foes, fully equipped with celestial weapons, for Vibhatsu<br>having once undertaken a task, never, droopeth under its weight. Without<br>that hero, however, that best of men, ourselves, with Krishna, cannot be<br>at rest in Kamyaka. Therefore, do thou mention some other wood that is<br>sacred and delightful, and abounds in food and fruits, and that is<br>inhabited by men of pious practices:&#8212;where we may pass some time,<br>expecting the warlike Arjuna of unbaffled prowess, like the Chataka in<br>expectation of gathering clouds. Do thou tell us of some asylums open to<br>the regenerate ones, and lakes and streams and beautiful mountains. O<br>Brahmana, deprived of Arjuna, I do not like to stay in this wood of<br>Kamyaka. We wish to go somewhere else.'"
