                            Vaisampayana said, "King Yudhishthira, hearing from the illustrious<br>Markandeya the story of the royal sage Indradyumna's regaining of Heaven,<br>again asked the Muni, saying, 'O great Muni, tell me in what condition<br>should a man practise charity in order to gain admission into the regions<br>of Indra? Is it by practising charity while leading a domestic mode of<br>life, or in boyhood, or in youth, or in old age? O, tell me about the<br>respective merits reaped from the practice of charity in these different<br>stages of life?'<br><br>Markandeya said, 'Life that is futile is of four kinds. Charity also that<br>is futile is of sixteen kinds. His life is vain who hath no son; and his<br>also who is out of pale of virtue: and his too who liveth on the food of<br>other; and, lastly, his who cooketh for himself without giving therefrom<br>unto the Pitris, the gods, and the guests, and who eateth of it before<br>these all. The gift to one that has fallen away from the practice of<br>virtuous vows, as also the gift of wealth that has been earned wrongly,<br>are both in vain. The gift to a fallen Brahmana, that to a thief, that<br>also to a preceptor that is false, is in vain. The gift to an untruthful<br>man, to a person that is sinful, to one that is ungrateful, to one that<br>officiates at sacrifices performed by all classes of people residing in a<br>village, to one that sells the Vedas,[52] to a Brahmana that cooks for<br>Sudra, to one that too by birth is a Brahmana but who is destitute of the<br>occupations of his order, is in vain. The gift to one that has married a<br>girl after the accession of puberty, to females, to one that sports with<br>snakes, and to one that is employed in menial offices, is also in vain.<br>These sixteen kinds of gifts are productive of no merits. That man who<br>with mind clouded with darkness giveth away from fear or anger, enjoyeth<br>the merit of such gift while he is in the womb of his mother. The man who<br>(under other circumstances) maketh gifts unto the Brahmanas, enjoyeth the<br>fruit thereof while he is in old age. Therefore, O king, the man who<br>wishes to win the way of heaven, should under all conditions, make gifts<br>unto Brahmanas of everything that he wishes to give away.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'By what means do Brahmanas, who accept gifts from<br>all the four orders, save others as well as themselves?"<br><br>"Markandeya said, 'By Japa,[53] and Mantras,[54] and Homa[55] and the<br>study of the Vedas, the Brahmanas construct a Vedic boat[56] wherewith<br>they save both others and themselves. The gods themselves are pleased<br>with that man who gratifieth the Brahmanas. Indeed, a man may attain<br>heaven at the command of a Brahmana. Thou wilt, O king, without doubt<br>ascend to regions of everlasting bliss, in consequence of thy worship of<br>the Pitris and the gods, and thy reverence for the Brahmanas, even though<br>thy body is filled with phlegmatic humours and withal so dull and inert!<br>He that desires virtue and heaven should adore the Brahmanas. One should<br>feed Brahmanas with care on occasions of Sraddhas, although those among<br>them that are cursed or fallen should be excluded. They also should be<br>carefully excluded that are either excessively fair or excessively black,<br>that have diseased nails, that are lepers, that are deceitful, that are<br>born in bastardy of widows or of women having husbands alive; and they<br>also that support themselves by the profession of arms. That Sraddha<br>which is censurable, consumeth the performer thereof like fire consuming<br>fuel. If they that are to be employed in Sraddhas happen to be dumb,<br>blind, or deaf, care should be taken to employ them along with Brahmanas<br>conversant with the Vedas. O Yudhishthira, listen now unto whom thou<br>shouldst give. He that knoweth all the Vedas should give only to that<br>able Brahmana who is competent to rescue both the giver and himself, for<br>he, indeed, is to be regarded as able who can rescue both the giver and<br>himself. O son of Pritha, the sacred fires do not receive such<br>gratification from libations of clarified butter, from offerings of<br>flowers and sandal and other perfumed pastes as from the entertainment of<br>guests. Therefore, do thou strive to entertain guests, O son of Pandu! O<br>king, they that give unto guests water to wash their feet, butter to rub<br>over their (tired) legs, light during the hours of darkness, food, and<br>shelter, have not to go before Yama. The removal (after worship) of the<br>flowery offerings unto the gods, the removal of the remnants of a<br>Brahmana's feast, waiting (upon a Brahmana) with perfumed pastes, and the<br>massaging of a Brahmana's limbs, are, each of them, O foremost of kings,<br>productive of greater merit than the gift of kine. A person, without<br>doubt, rescueth himself by the gift of a Kapila cow. Therefore, should<br>one give away a Kapila cow decked with ornaments unto Brahmanas. O thou<br>of the Bharata race, one should give unto a person of good lineage and<br>conversant with the Vedas; unto a person that is poor; unto one leading a<br>domestic mode of life but burdened with wife and children; unto one that<br>daily adoreth the sacred fire; and unto one that hath done thee no<br>service. Thou shouldst always give unto such persons but not to them that<br>are in affluence. What merit is there, O thou foremost of the Bharata<br>race, by giving unto one that is affluent? One cow must be given unto one<br>Brahmana. A single cow must not be given unto many. For if the cow so<br>given away (unto many) be sold, the giver's family is lost for three<br>generations. Such a gift would not assuredly rescue the giver nor the<br>Brahmana that takes it. He who giveth eighty Ratis of pure gold, earneth<br>the merit of giving away a hundred pieces of gold for ever. He that<br>giveth away a strong bull capable also of drawing the plough, is<br>certainly rescued from all difficulties and finally goeth to heaven. He<br>that giveth away land unto a learned Brahmana, hath all his desires<br>fulfilled. The tired traveller, with weakened limbs and feet besmeared<br>with dust, asks for the name of him that may give him food. There are men<br>who answer him by telling him the name. That wise man who informs these<br>toil-worn ones of the name of the person who may give them food, is,<br>without doubt, regarded as equal in merit unto the giver himself of food.<br>Therefore, abstaining from other kinds of gift, give thou food. There is<br>no merit (arising out of gifts) that is so great as that of giving food.<br>The man that according to the measure of his might gives well-cooked and<br>pure food unto the Brahmanas, acquires, by that act of his, the<br>companionship of Prajapati (Brahma). There is nothing superior to food.<br>Therefore, food is regarded as the first and foremost of all things (to<br>be given away). It hath been said that food itself is Prajapati. And<br>Prajapati is regarded as the Year. And the Year is sacrifice. And<br>everything is established in sacrifice, for it is from sacrifice that all<br>creatures, mobile and immobile, take their origin. For this reason, it<br>hath been heard by us, food is the foremost of all things. They that give<br>away lakes and large pieces of water, and tanks and wells, and shelter<br>and food and they that have sweet words for all, have not to hear the<br>admonitions of Yama. With him who gives rice, and wealth earned by his<br>labour, unto Brahmana of good behaviour, the earth is satisfied. And she<br>poureth upon him showers of wealth. The giver of food walketh first,<br>after him the speaker of truth and he that giveth unto persons that do<br>not solicit. But the three go to the same place.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing all this, Yudhishthira, along with his<br>younger brothers, impelled by curiosity, again addressed the high-souled<br>Markandeya, saying, 'O great Muni, what is the distance of Yama's region<br>from that of men? What is its measurement? How also do men pass it over?<br>And by what means? O, tell me all this!'<br><br>"Markandeya said, 'O king, O them foremost of virtuous men, this question<br>of thine appertains to a great mystery. It is sacred and much applauded<br>by the Rishis. Appertaining as it also does to virtue, I will speak of it<br>to thee. The distance of Yama's region from the abode of men is, O king,<br>eighty-six thousand Yojanas! The way is over space, without water, and<br>very terrible to behold; Nowhere on that road is the shade of a tree,<br>nowhere any water, and nowhere any resting place in which the traveller,<br>when fatigued, may rest for some moments. And men and women and all on<br>earth that have life, are forcibly led along this way by the messengers<br>of Yama. Those creatures that obey the mandates of the grim king, and<br>they, O king, that have given horses and other good conveyances unto<br>Brahmanas, proceed along this way on those animals and vehicles. And they<br>that have given umbrellas proceed along this way with umbrellas warding<br>off the sun's rays. And they that have given food, proceed without<br>hunger, while they that have not given food proceed afflicted with<br>hunger. And they that have given robes, proceed along this way attired in<br>robes while they that have given none, proceed naked. And they that have<br>given gold, proceed in happiness, themselves decked in ornaments. And<br>they that have given land, proceed with every desire completely<br>gratified. And they that have given grain, proceed without being<br>afflicted with any want. And they that have given houses, proceed happily<br>on cars. And those men that have given something to drink, proceed with<br>cheerful hearts unafflicted with thirst. And they that have given lights,<br>proceed happily lighting the way before them. And they that have given<br>kine, proceed along the way happily, freed from all their sins. And they<br>that have fasted for a month, proceed on cars drawn by swans. And they<br>who have fasted for six nights, proceed on cars drawn by peacocks. And, O<br>son of Pandu, he that fasteth three nights upon only one meal without a<br>second during this period goeth into a region free from disease and<br>anxiety. And water hath this excellent property that it produceth<br>happiness in the region of Yama. And they that give water find for<br>themselves a river there of the name of Pushpodaka. And the givers of<br>water on the earth drink cool and ambrosial draughts from that stream.<br>And they that are of evil deeds have pus ordained for them. Thus, O great<br>king, that river serveth all purposes. Therefore, O king, adore thou duly<br>these Brahmanas (that are with thee). Weak in limbs owing to the way he<br>has walked, and besmeared with the dust of the high-road, the traveller<br>enquireth for the name of him who giveth food, and cometh in hope to his<br>house. Adore thou him with reverent attention, for he indeed is a guest,<br>and he is a Brahmana. The gods with Indra at their head follow him as he<br>proceedeth. And if he is adored, the gods with Indra become gratified,<br>and if he is not adored, the celestials with their chief become<br>cheerless. Therefore, O thou foremost of kings, worship thou these<br>Brahmanas duly. I have thus spoken to thee upon a hundred subjects. What<br>dost thou desire to hear from me again?'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O master, conversant thou art with virtue and<br>morality, and so I desire to repeatedly listen to thee as thou speakest<br>on sacred subjects appertaining to virtue and morals.'<br><br>"Markandeya said, 'O king, I will now speak on another sacred subject<br>appertaining to eternal interests and capable of washing off all sins.<br>Listen thou with rapt attention. O thou foremost of the Bharatas, the<br>merit equal to that of giving away a Kapila cow in (the tirtha called)<br>Jyeshtha-Pushkara arises from washing the feet of Brahmanas. As long as<br>the earth remains wet with water which a Brahmana hath touched with his<br>feet, so long do Pitris drink water of cups made of lotus-leaves. If the<br>guest is welcomed (with enquiries about his welfare), the deities of fire<br>become glad; and if he is offered a seat, it is the god of a hundred<br>sacrifices, who is gratified. If his feet are washed, it is the Pitris<br>who are delighted; and if he is fed it is Prajapati that is pleased. One<br>should with collected soul, give a cow when (during her throes) the feet<br>and head of her calf are visible, before her delivery is complete. A cow<br>with her calf in the air in course of falling from the uterus to the<br>earth, is to be regarded as equal to the earth herself. He, therefore,<br>that giveth away such a cow, reapeth the merit of giving away the earth.<br>And he that giveth away such a cow, is adored in heaven for as many<br>thousands of Yugas as there are bristles on the bodies of the animal and<br>her young one together. And, O Bharata, he that having accepted a thing<br>in gift giveth it away immediately unto a person that is virtuous and<br>honest, reapeth very great merit. Without doubt, he reapeth the fruit of<br>giving away the whole earth to her utmost limits and with her oceans and<br>seas and caves, her mountains and forests and woods. That Brahmana who<br>eateth in silence from a plate, keeping his hands between his knees,<br>succeedeth in rescuing others. And those Brahmanas that abstain from<br>drink and who are never spoken of by others as having any faults and who<br>daily read the Samhitas, are capable of rescuing others. Libations of<br>butter and edible offerings should all be presented to a Brahmana who is<br>learned in the Vedas. And as libations of clarified butter poured into<br>fire never go in vain, so gift to virtuous Brahmanas learned in the Vedas<br>can never go in vain. The Brahmanas have anger for their weapon; they<br>never fight with arms of iron and steel. Indeed the Brahmanas slay with<br>anger like Indra slaying the Asuras with his thunder-bolt.<br><br>Thus prelection appertaining to virtue and morality is now over. Hearing<br>this, the Munis of the forest of Naimisha were filled with delight. And<br>those ascetics were also freed from grief and anger by listening to it.<br>And they were also purged of all their sins in consequence of this. And,<br>O king, those human beings that listen to it become freed from the<br>obligation of rebirth.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O thou of great wisdom, what purification is there<br>by which a Brahmana may always keep himself pure? I desire to hear of it<br>from thee, O thou foremost of all virtuous men!"<br><br>"Markandeya answered, 'There are three kinds of purity, viz., purity in<br>speech, purity in deed, and purity achieved by use of water. He that has<br>recourse to these three different kinds of purity, attains, without<br>doubt, to heaven. That Brahmana who adoreth the goddess Sandhya in the<br>morning and the evening, and who recites meditatively the sacred goddess<br>Gayatri who is the mother of the Vedas, sanctified by the latter, is<br>freed from all his sins. Even if he accepts in gift the entire earth with<br>her oceans, he doth not, on that account, suffer the least unhappiness.<br>And those heavenly bodies in the sky including the sun that may be<br>inauspicious and hostile towards him soon become auspicious and<br>favourable towards him in consequence of these acts of his, while those<br>stars that are auspicious and favourable become more auspicious and more<br>favourable in consequence of such conduct of his. And terrible Rakshasas<br>subsisting on animal food, or gigantic and fierce mien, all become unable<br>to prevail over a Brahmana who practiseth these purifications. The<br>Brahmanas are even like blazing fires. They incur no fault in consequence<br>of teaching, of officiating at sacrifices, and of accepting gifts from<br>others. Whether the Brahmana be cognisant of the Vedas or ignorant of<br>them, whether they be pure or impure, they should never be insulted, for<br>Brahmanas are like fires. As the fire that blazeth up in the place set<br>apart for the cremation of the dead is never regarded impure on that<br>account, so the Brahmana, be he learned or ignorant, is always pure. He<br>is great and a very god! Cities that are adorned with walls and gates and<br>palaces one after another, lose their beauty if they are bereft of<br>Brahmanas. That, indeed, O king, is a city where Brahmanas accomplished<br>in the Vedas, duly observing the duties of their order and possessed of<br>learning and ascetic merit, reside. O son of Pritha, that spot, be it a<br>wood or pasture land, where learned Brahmanas reside, hath been called a<br>city. And that place, O king, becometh a tirtha also. By approaching a<br>king that offereth protection, as also a Brahmana possessed of ascetic<br>merit, and by offering worship unto both, a man may purge off his sins<br>immediately. The learned have said that ablutions in the sacred tirthas,<br>recitation of the names of holy ones, and converse with the good and<br>virtuous, are all acts worthy of applause. They that are virtuous and<br>honest always regard themselves as sanctified by the holy companionship<br>of persons like themselves and by the water of pure and sacred converse.<br>The carrying of three staffs, the vow of silence, matted hair on head,<br>the shaving of the crown, covering one's person with barks and deerskins,<br>the practice of vows, ablutions, the worship of fire, abode in the woods,<br>emaciating the body, all these are useless if the heart be not pure. The<br>indulgence of the six senses is easy, if purity be not sought in the<br>object of enjoyment. Abstinence, however, which of itself is difficult,<br>is scarcely easy without purity of the objects of enjoyment. O king of<br>kings, among the six senses, the mind alone that is easily moved is the<br>most dangerous! Those high-souled persons that do not commit sins in<br>word, deed, heart and soul, are said to undergo ascetic austerities, and<br>not they that suffer their bodies to be wasted by fasts and penances. He<br>that hath no feeling of kindness for relatives cannot be free from sin<br>even if his body be pure. That hard-heartedness of his is the enemy of<br>his asceticism. Asceticism, again, is not mere abstinence from the<br>pleasures of the world. He that is always pure and decked with virtue, he<br>that practises kindness all his life, is a Muni even though he may lead a<br>domestic life. Such a man is purged of all his sins. Fasts and other<br>penances cannot destroy sins, however much they may weaken and dry up the<br>body that is made of flesh and blood. The man whose heart is without<br>holiness, suffers torture only by undergoing penances in ignorance of<br>their meaning. He is never freed from sins of such acts. The fire he<br>worshippeth doth not consume his sins. It is in consequence of holiness<br>and virtue alone that men attain to regions of blessedness, and fasts and<br>vows become efficacious. Subsistence on fruits and roots, the vow of<br>silence, living upon air, the shaving of the crown, abandonment of a<br>fixed home, the wearing of matted locks on the head, lying under the<br>canopy of heaven, daily fasts, the worship of fire, immersion in water,<br>and lying on the bare ground,&#8212;these alone cannot produce such a result.<br>They only that are possessed of holiness succeed, by knowledge and deeds,<br>to conquer disease, decrepitude and death, and acquire a high status. As<br>seeds that have been scorched by fire do not sprout forth, so the pains<br>that have been burnt by knowledge cannot effect the soul. This inert body<br>that is only like a block of wood when destitute of souls, is, without<br>doubt, short lived like froth in the ocean. He that obtaineth a view of<br>his soul, the soul that resideth in every body, by help of one or half of<br>a rhythmic line (of the Vedas), hath no more need for anything. Some<br>obtaining a knowledge of identity with the Supreme Soul from but two<br>letters (of the Vedas) and some from hundreds and thousands of rhythmic<br>lines, acquire salvation, for the knowledge of one's identity with the<br>Supreme Soul is the sure indication of salvation. The men of old,<br>distinguished for their knowledge, have said, neither this world nor that<br>hereafter nor bliss can be his who is disturbed by doubts. And belief of<br>one's identity with the Supreme Soul is the indication of salvation. He<br>that knoweth the true meaning of the Vedas, understandeth their true use.<br>Such a man is affrighted at the Vedic ritual like a man at sight of a<br>forest conflagration. Giving up dry disputation, have recourse to Sruti<br>and Smriti, and seek thou, with the aid of thy reason, the knowledge of<br>the Undecaying One that is without a second. One's search (after this<br>knowledge) becometh futile from defect of means. Therefore, should one<br>carefully strive to obtain that knowledge by aid of the Vedas. The Vedas<br>are the Supreme Soul; they are His body; they are the Truth. The soul<br>that is bounded by the animal organism is incompetent to know Him in whom<br>all the Vedas merge. That Supreme Soul, however, is capable of being<br>known by the pure intellect. The existence of the gods as stated in the<br>Vedas, the efficacy of acts, and the capacity for action of being<br>furnished with bodies, are noticeable in every Yuga. Independence of<br>these and annihilation are to be sought from purity of the senses.<br>Therefore, the suspension of the function of the senses is the true<br>fasting. One may attain to heaven by asceticism, one may obtain objects<br>of enjoyment by the practice of charity and may have his sins purged off<br>by ablutions in tirthas. But complete emancipation cannot be had except<br>by knowledge.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed, O great king, by the Rishi,<br>Yudhishthira of great fame then said, 'O holy one, I desire to listen to<br>the rules about that charity which is meritorious."<br><br>"Markandeya said, 'O great king, O Yudhishthira, the rules about charity<br>which thou wishest to hear from me are always highly regarded by me.<br>Listen now to the mysteries of charity as expounded in the sruti and the<br>smritis! A man that performs a sraddha in the conjunction called<br>Gajacchaya at a place that is fanned by the leaves of the Aswattha tree<br>enjoys the fruits thereof, O Yudhishthira, for a hundred thousand kalpas.<br>O king, he that foundeth a dharmasala and established there a person to<br>look after all comers, is crowned with the merits of all the sacrifices.<br>He that giveth away a horse at a tirtha where the current of the river<br>runneth in a direction opposite to its general course, reapeth merit that<br>is inexhaustible. The guest that comes to one's house for food is none<br>other than Indra himself. If he is entertained with food, Indra himself<br>conferreth on the best merit that is inexhaustible. As men cross seas by<br>vessels, so are the givers mentioned above are saved from all their sins.<br>So what is given unto Brahmanas produceth, like gift of curds,<br>inexhaustible merits. A gift on particular lunations produceth merit that<br>is twice as much as a gift on other days. That in a particular season<br>produceth merit ten times greater that in other seasons. That in a<br>particular year produceth merit a hundred times greater than in other<br>years. And lastly, a gift on the last day of the last month of the year<br>produceth merit that is inexhaustible. A gift also that is made while the<br>Sun is on the solstitial points, one again that is made on the last day<br>of the Sun's path through Libra, Aries, Gemini, Virgo, and Pisces, a gift<br>again during eclipses of the Moon and the Sun, produce merit that is<br>inexhaustible. The learned have also said that gifts made during the<br>seasons produce merit that is ten times, those made during the change of<br>seasons, a hundred times&#8212;and those made during the days when Rahu is<br>visible, a thousand times&#8212;greater than what is produced by gifts at<br>other time; while a gift made on the last day of the Sun's course through<br>Libra and Aries produces merit that knows no diminution. O king, no one<br>can enjoy landed possessions unless he giveth away land, and no one can<br>go on cars and vehicles unless he giveth away these. Indeed a person on<br>rebirth obtaineth the fruition of whatever objects he hath in view at the<br>time of making a gift to a Brahmana. Gold hath sprung from Fire; the<br>Earth from Vishnu; and the cows from the Sun. He, therefore, that giveth<br>away gold, land, and kine attaineth all the regions of Agni, Vishnu, and<br>the Sun. There is nothing so eternal as a gift. Where, therefore, in the<br>three worlds is anything that is more auspicious? It is for this, O king,<br>that they who have great intelligence say that there is nothing higher<br>and greater in the three worlds than gift!'"
