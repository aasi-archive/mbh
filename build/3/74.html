                            "Damayanti said, 'O Kesini, go thou and learn who that charioteer is that<br>sitteth by the car, unsightly and possessed of short arms. O blessed one,<br>O faultless one, approaching him, cautiously and with suit words, make<br>thou the usual inquiries of courtesy and learn all particulars truly.<br>Having regard to the feeling of satisfaction my mind experienceth, and<br>the delight my heart feeleth, I am greatly afraid this one is king Nala<br>himself. And, O faultless one, having inquired after his welfare, thou<br>shalt speak unto him the words of Parnada. And, O beauteous one,<br>understand the reply he may make thereto.' Thus instructed, that female<br>messenger, going cautiously, while the blessed Damayanti watched from the<br>terrace, addressed Vahuka in these words, 'O foremost of men, thou art<br>welcome. I wish thee happiness. O bull among men, hear now the words of<br>Damayanti. When did ye all set out, and with what object have ye come<br>hither. Tell us truly, for the princess of Vidarbha wisheth to hear it.'<br>Thus addressed, Vahuka answered, the illustrious king of Kosala had heard<br>from a Brahmana that a second Swayamvara of Damayanti would take place.<br>And hearing it, he hath come here, by the help of excellent steeds fleet<br>as the wind and capable of going a hundred yojanas. I am his charioteer.<br>Kesini then asked, 'Whence doth the third among you come, and whose (son)<br>is he? And whose son art thou, and how hast thou come to do this work?'<br>Thus questioned, Vahuka replied, 'He (of whom thou inquirest) was the<br>charioteer of the virtuous Nala, and known to all by the name of<br>Varshneya. After Nala had, O beauteous one, left his kingdom, he came to<br>the son of Bhangasura. I am skilled in horse-lore, and have, therefore,<br>been appointed as charioteer. Indeed, king Rituparna hath himself chosen<br>me as his charioteer and cook.' At this Kesini rejoined, 'Perhaps<br>Varshneya knoweth where king Nala hath gone, and O Vahuka, he may also<br>have spoken to thee (about his master).' Vahuka then said, 'Having<br>brought hither the children of Nala of excellent deeds, Varshneya went<br>away whither he listed: He doth not know where Naishadha is. Nor, O<br>illustrious one, doth anybody else know of Nala's whereabouts; for the<br>king (in calamity) wandereth over the world in disguise and despoiled of<br>(his native) beauty. Nala's self only knoweth Nala. Nala never<br>discovereth his marks of identity anywhere.' Thus addressed, Kesini<br>returned, 'The Brahmana that had before this gone to Ayodhya, had<br>repeatedly said these words suitable to female lips, 'O beloved gambler,<br>where hast thou gone cutting off half my piece of cloth, and deserting<br>me, his dear and devoted wife asleep in the woods? And she herself, as<br>commanded by him, waiteth expecting him clad in half a garment and<br>burning day and night in grief. O king, O hero, do thou relent towards<br>her that weepeth ceaselessly for that calamity and do thou give her an<br>answer. O illustrious one, do thou speak the words agreeable to her for<br>the blameless one panteth to hear them. Hearing these words of the<br>Brahmana thou didst formerly give a reply! The princess of Vidarbha again<br>wisheth to hear the words thou didst then say.'"<br><br>"Vrihadaswa continued, 'O son of the Kuru race, hearing these words of<br>Kesini, Nala's heart was pained, and his eyes filled with tears. And<br>repressing his sorrow, the king who was burning in grief, said again<br>these words, in accents choked with tears: 'Chaste women, though<br>overtaken by calamity, yet protect themselves, and thereby secure heaven.<br>Women that are chaste, deserted by their lords, never become angry, but<br>continue to live, cased in virtue's mail. Deserted by one fallen into<br>calamity, bereft of sense, and despoiled of bliss, it behoveth her not to<br>be angry. A virtuous lady should not be angry with one that was deprived<br>by birds of his garment while striving to procure sustenance and who is<br>burning in misery. Whether treated well or ill she would never be angry,<br>seeing her husband in that plight, despoiled of his kingdom, bereft of<br>prosperity, oppressed with hunger, and overwhelmed with calamity.' And, O<br>Bharata, while speaking thus, Nala oppressed with grief, could not<br>restrain his tears, but began to weep. And thereupon Kesini went back to<br>Damayanti, and acquainted her with everything about that conversation as<br>well as that outburst of grief."
